About a year and a half ago Congress
appropriated about $1,600,000 to reim
burse the State of Massachusetts for
expenses incurred in fitting out troops
during the Civil War, including Inter
est and premium on gold paid by the
State. Previously the State authorities
had entered into a contract with a
Washington lawyer to act a3 State agent
in looking after the claim, and agreed
to allow him 10 per cent of the amount
received. The attorney holds the war
rant and refuses to turn it over to the
State until his fee of 5160,000 is paid.
The State contends that the fee Is
grossly excessive and makes other alle
gations tending to show that the attor
ney is not entitled to the fee claimed.
The Attorney General holds that he
warrant belongs to the State and that
the attorney has recourse to the courts
to establish his rights in the matter.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â The Attor
ney General to-day rendered an opinion
in which he holds that a treasury war
rant issued in favor of the State of
Massachusetts and now held by a local
attorney here under power of attorney
on the plea that his fee has not been
paid must be turned over to the State,
and that, should the attorney refuse to
do so, the warrant will be canceled and
a new warrant issued to the State.

not feared in the present circumstance,
Panama is greatly excited.
PANAMA, Nov. IT.â The treaty be
tween the United States and Panama
has prevented one more revolution on
the isthmus. The rumored coup d'etat
by the military element, it seems,
was more serious than it was at first
believed to be. Minister Barrett, after
a consultation with the Panama Gov
ernment and General Davis, the com
mander of the canal zone, decided to
ask Admiral Goodrich to leave one ot
the warships of the United States Pa
cific squadron here to prevent any pos
sible disturbance. This morning 200
marines from Empire Camp arrived
here.

Mr. Mangan had not a word to say
about florists on the floor of the con
vention yesterday, but spoke as a gas
fitter. -
The Chicago Federation had several
speakers; who were masesd in a. bunch
at the lower end of. the convention hall.
They arose in turn. It was no sur
prise that John Mangan. who was ad
mitted as a florist delegate on the
preceding day. was the longest and the
strongest speaker in the matter of
massing of facts and statements that
the Chlcagoans put forward to justify
themselves in their disobedience of the
command of tha executive council . of
the American Federation to withdraw
their recognition f^om two Chicago
bodies that are not affiliated with the
American Federation.
. The net result of the proceedings of
yesterday would seem to be a drawn
battle, or. at least an armistice, with
the advantage somewhat in favor of
the Chicago Federation In the points at
issue as against the executive council.
As was foreshadowed by the admis
sion of John Jlangan as a delegate to
the convention of the American
Federation of .Labor against the votes
of the leaders of the federation "Wed
nesday, the executive council of the
federation failed to finally exclude the
Chicasro Federation of Labor ye3terday.
Schardt seeks admission as a repre
sentative of the Chicago Federation.
The executive council caused . the
charter of the Chicago Federation to [
be taken away recently for non-com- {
I>liance with the laws of the American !
Federation. A battle raged all the
afternoon along the firing: line of the
convention yesterday. At the end. on (
the motion of Treasurer Lennon, a f
member of the executive council, the |
report of the credentials committee and
that part of the report of the executive ;
council that refers to the Chicago
Federation matter was referred to the
committee on local and federated
bodies. That committee consists of "W.
B. Wilson, -William J. Gllthorpe. George
K. Smith, William B. Macfarlane, !

Continued on Pace 2, Column 1.
Several times .while the Chicago
Federation's status was under discus
sion the question of -whether the truth
was told by delegates who spoke was
raised.' Schardt,- the head of the Chi
cago Federation.. not having yet a seat
on the* convention^ floor under- the re
port i of. the committee on -, credentials,
was ; not r heard from as an individual,
but the' fight carried on in . behalf
of the position taken by the Chicasroans
was undoubtedly " largely directed ' by
While Case Is Under Consideration He
Keeps in Background.
Much of the time while the fight over
the Chicago Federation was proceed
ing John Mitchell presided. President
Gompers afterward took the gavel.
Both Mitchell and Gompers were in
clined to give wide latitude to the Chi
cago Federation and permitted its rep
resentatives to speak longer than the
time prescribed under the by-laws.
Gompers remarked that be wanted all
to have a fair show. The fight for
Chicago was made by Delegates Dole.
Fltzpatrick and Mangan principally.
On the other side were lined up Dun
can. Hayes. Spencer, Higgins. J. 'L.
Sullivan and T. J. Duffy. The vote to
make the reference of the whole mat
ter to the committee on local and
federated bodies was close â 95 for and
S3 against.
Some Idea of the vim that was oc
casionally put into the struggle ntay
be gained by reading extracts from
some of the speeches.
Delegate Hayes said in part in sup
port of ttfe position of the executive
council:
Tfca action cf the executive council la right

tion aad that may teach the Chicago Fed
eration of Labor and ita delesates a lessoa

mandates of the American Federation o*
Labor, the highest cenrt of labcr ta thÂ« Cniteii
States of America, must be obeyed. I bÂ«UevÂ«
la positive action, bat I do not stand her*
and say that the Chicago Federation of Labor
Â¦was wrons In Its criticism of thÂ« executive
council, because tt may some time b* la error.
In many Instances it has been wrong, bat
there must be a parting of tha way soma

far what is the u** of passing laws unless
they arÂ» to be carried oat? A decision by
this convention would have a tendency ta
clarify th* atmosphere in Chicasro if rendered
In tavor ot the executive council, and I tru*t
that the convention will be as decisive upon
the matter a* wag the executive council and
that the law wiU be UDheld.
Delegate Dole said for the Chicasro
Federation in part:
The local onion of pr?ssfeeders .has been

or sixteen years and it U the only prwafeed-rV
union in existence tn the city of Chicago.

council of the American Federation to
ccme forward to censure the 'Chicago
Federation for its position were about
the same body as opposed the seating
of Mangan.
The primary proposition of the Chi

oc the convention floor was that a com
mittee should be appointed to go to
Chicasro and there make investigation.

NEW YORK, Nov. 17.â Spectators
were' thrown' into intense excitement
to-night at the horse show in Madison
square Garden when John G- Heck
sher, secretary of the National Horse
Show Association of America, was run
down and trampled upon by a pair of
horses on exhibition in the ring.
Hecksher had started to cross the
ring. He was passing in front of a
team driven by Mrs. Edward R. Ladew
of Glencove, L. I., when one of the
horses lunged forward and struck him.
In an instant he was down and his
head and shoulders were struck several
times by the horses' hoofs. When help
reached him he was almost uncon
scious, his face was cut in several
places and he was bleeding profusely.

The principal witness at the after
coon session was Adrian Wills. He de-
Bcribed how he had rushed up to the
August Geigf r, a cousin of Mrs. Web
er, is here from Sacramento to give
euppcrt to the prisoner. Geiger Is ac
companied by his wife and child.
In regard to the statements made by
Sirs. Snowden at the Coroner's inquest
last night. Weber to-day denied that
his mother had ever expressed the
slightest fear of him. He said that
he hn4 always been a loving son to her.
He also denied that he had made any
threat against Mrs. Snowden the morn
ing after the murders.
There was nothing cf special impor
tance elicited during the preliminary
hearing; to-day ether than the testi
mony of Charles Dunhamv who said
that he saw young Weber jump out of
the northeast window on the north side
cf the house on the night of the fire.
He said that one of Weber's hands
Â¦was covered with blood. This Incident
happened after the three bodies had
been removed from the house.
Dan Heany testified that he was
early en the ground on the night of the
fire, but he did not see young Weber
there.
DID XOT SEE WEBER AT FERE.
F. P. McKirstry, who was one of thÂ»
first to reach the fire, testified that
when he arrived there Mrs. Snowden
â¢was terribly excited and -.was trying to
break into the house to rescue her
relatives. Finding all the doors and
-window* locked he climbed over a
perch and broke into the front room
upstairs. According to his testimony
the snioke was not heavy, but as he
had co knowledge of the house he slid
down from the balcony and going
around to a side window burst it in and
then passed out a lot of furniture. He
Kays he ran around the house several
times, but did not see Weber.
Miss Addle Mulligan and Miss Ida
Brown, who are employed by the tele
phone company, testified that the tele
phone line which was connected -with
the Weber residence went out of ser
vice at â¬:SS o'clock on the night of the
tragedy. Some one had called up from
the house and when they responded
there was no answer.
As Weber was leaving the courtroom
at the conclusion of the afternoon ses
sion several of his relatives who had
been sitting with the spectators ad
vanced to meet him. Miss Laura Hess,
a cousin, kissed him and his face be
came radiant. Others in the party
took h'.in. by the hand and gave him
words of hope and cheer.
It sn vbfle Adrian "Wills was on
the witness stand this afternoon eiv
isg testimony at the preliminary hear
ing being conducted by Justice Smith
that Weber gave way to tears. Wills
was relating the story of how he had
found the prisoner in a faintine condi
tion under a magnolia tree in front of
the burning home on the night of the
murders, when Weber suddenly dio
ped the. end of his handkerchief in a
glass of water on a table in front of
him and commenced bathing: his fore
head. He appeared to be suffering 1 in
tense agony and although he fought
hard to keep back the tears that were
welling in his eyes he failed. Slowly
the tears coursed down his cheeks and
he buried his face in his handkerchief.
His frame quivered and not a few of
the spectators expected him to become
hysterical. A few minutes later, how
ever, he slowly raised his head and
glanced around the courtroom in a non
chalant manner. His eves were bright
and burning as if with fever, his
lips were tightly compressed and his
face was cold and ashen lookine. The
v/eak cpell soon passed away and dur
ing the remainder of the session he sat
as cool and collected as if he was the
most disinterested spectator.
RELATIVES WILL HELP HIM.
Confinement in Jail is at last begin
ning to tell on young Weber. He gave
signs of weakness to-daf and for the
first time since the terrible tragedy dis
played emotion. Those who know him
best have been expecting him to col
lapse and that he has held up thus far
shows tLa.t he is possessed of nerves
of iron. "
SHOWS SIGNS OF WEAKNESS.
AUBURX, Nov. 17. â The Coroner's
Jcry in the Weber case, after forty
minutes' deliberation to-night, found
that Julius, Mary and Bertha Weber
came to their deaths from pistol
wounds, and expressed the belief
"that said pistol wounds were in-
Cicted by Adoiph J; Weber and that
the boy Earl Weber came to his death
from wounds inflicted by a blunt in
strument and froin suffocation."
Weber was in his cell on ; the first
f.ocr of the Courthotzse when the jury
returned the verdict and the news was
Quickly conveyed to him by one of the
Sheriffs deputies. The prisoner ap
peared to be prepared for the unwel
come tidings and did not display the
It-ast emotion. When asked by ThÂ»
Call correspondent if he had any statÂ«?
rr.er.t to make, he replied, "I will have
rcthing to say until after I have read
the testimony taken before the Coro
ner."
It is claimed that Colonel Hecker was
interested in bigr lumber and other con
tracts. He disapproved of what he
called the "red tape methods" of the
commission, and had several clashes
with Admiral Walker.
In conversation with several friends
here, to-day Colonel Hecker said the
'red tape methods" of the commission
were responsible largely for his resig
nation. He asserted that he was a
"man of action" and could not toler
ate the slow procedure adopted by Ad
miral Walker and his other associates
upon the* commission.
It is charged that Colonel Hecker
conducted himself in a manner cal
culated to arouse the suspicion that
business interests were guiding him
largely in the performance of/ his du
ties. Immediately after the commission
reached the conclusion to purchase 1000
damp cars. Colonel Hecker. it was dis
covered, wired to friends in the United
Stages, urging them to work for the
contract. These frienris, it is said, im
mediately began to lobby for the con
tract. Admiral Walker tdok steps to
frustrate the work of the lobby.
Hecker's business methods and the
way he proposed handling the 5X0,000,000
preliminarily appropriated for begin
ning the work have been seriously crit
icized. â¢
In tendering his resignation, Colonel
Hecker says he is afraid of the climate
of Panama. An investigation of the
facts show that his retirement has been
expected by those close to the President
and Admiral Walker.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â The resig
nation of Colonel Frank J. Hecker of
the Isthmian Commission which was
made public to-day was the result of
serious friction in the commission.
Other changes are expected to follow
Secretary Taft's visit to the isthmus,
during- which he will carefully Investi
gate charges and complaints against
other Commissioners. Admiral Walker
hereafter will be the actual as well as
the theoretical head of the commission,
directly subordinate to Secretary Taft.
If General Davis is not removed as
Governor of the canal zone, his powers
will be restricted. Minister Barrett will
be supreme in the negotiations for a
settlement of all disputes with the
Panama Government.

disposed of and the floor given over
to visitors.; The value of organization
was the-cfiief topic the co-opera
tive shop was discussed at length, the
speakers declaring it the best weapon
with which to fight thejjpen shop. '
Among.- those who addressed the
meeting. were C. H. Woodman, dele
gate of the International Typographi

Fitzpatrick, secretary J of the Chicago
Federation of Labor; William Wood,
delegate from, the International Cigar

During the business session It was
reported that the co-operative shop in
Oakland is doing well. The sheep
butchers are still out on strike and the
boycott- has been so effective. that the
demand for mutton and lamb has

beef instead. Ten carloads of union

received from Portland and more is
expected.

This cleared up about all the business
connected directly with the routine of
the convention and there were to come
the two special orders. The first
brought to the front of the stage aa
speakers: William Abraham. M. P
James Wignall and John A: Flett. The
first two are the British delegates to
the convention. Flett represents Cana
da. These three occupied the stage un
til the noon recess. Thp convention
conferred on each a federation badge
and gold watch, and Mrs. Wignall
received a gold pin. The watch pre
sentation was made by Vice President
O'Connell.
The three delegates from abroad
proved to be pleasing speakers. The
two Englishmen are broad of girth and
florid of complexion. The Canadian
delegate is less stout and less buoyant
in manner. The chief interest natur
ally attached to the remarks of Abra
ham, popularly known as "Mabon." He
has been a member of the British Par
liament nineteen years. Wignall was
first introduced. He has a voice that
could be heard above, a gale at sea.
His manner and matter caught the
fancy of the delegates and he was
cheered long and loudly. Abraham

SoniÂ« of tho associations who are defending
the laws a* they have stood for twenty year*
have made very little progress in the way of
increasing their membership during the past
Fix or ueVen years. Others who claim no
knowledge of the laws have increased their
membership a hundredfold. Therefore Mr
Chairman, as a. landsman, I hope the report of
the commltte* will bÂ« adopted.
It was after due and careful deliberation
that they recommended the adoption of that
resolution by the convention. And In present
ing . it here we arÂ« presenting their views,
their ideas, their experience as seamen as a
safeguard against the loss of life to those em
ployed aboard ship
The resolution referred to by the authority
on maritime law was Introduced by a seaman
Â¦who has been employed as a seaman for at
least twenty years. The matter was referred
to a committee of maritime workers, who
might in a terra be considered stamen. This
bugaboo of only one Individual understanding
anything about the maritime law. or usages
has be*n trotted out before this convention for
a great number of years. I want to say to
my friends that we have more maritime work
ers aboard of the boats on the Great Lakes'
than are belonging to their association. That
goes without contradiction because we have
got the figures to prove it.
We have all the marine flrf-men and oilers
and others who are a part of the so-called
st-amen in the term referred to by our friend.
Certainly they have some knowledge of the
eeafarir.g business. I don't know whether
they have ever consulted our friend o r not a*
to . what term or what particular construction
ought to be put on any resolution, but I do
know that the resolution was submitted to our
convention by a man who had twenty years'
experience as a seaman; and the resolution
was referred to a committee largely com
posed of maritime workers, known as under
the term of our friend here, seamen.
These remarks struck fire and Keefe
came back with the following in part:
Then Â»e are to be placed under the Jurisdic
ilon of a State Commerce Commission. Now. I
will tell you where we will be. We are under
the Jurisdiction of the United States Court
now, when we are on the sea, and when we are

State courts, because when you are en ihe one
aide of the dock you are under the police Ju
risdiction of the State: when we are at 6oa we
are under the Jurisdiction of the United States

to that, the jurisdiction cf a State Commerce
Commission. Here are men claiming to repre

and they have come into this convention and
asked tor the adoption of such unutterable rot
as this. #
They comÂ« here and are asking for eomethinj;
that puts a premium upon the sending vt un
seawcrthy vessels to sea overmanned and over
loaded, so that they can collect thetr full
amount of Insurance frvm the insurance com
panlts. Why. that very thing has been fought

"It would be well." said Furuseth. "if
the International Marine Workers' As
sociation of the United States and its
officers had consulted with the sailors,
with the men who go to sea; or it
might have been well, perhaps, if they
had left maritime matters to men who
follow the sea. These resolutions are
to seamen a most surprising thingâ so
surprising that they could not by. any
possible manner of means come from
any one but a landsman." Continuing,

had referred to his family at any time
during the night of the murders or on
the following morning.

house when he saw it was on fire to
render assistance. He testified that
when he got there he saw young Weber
standing at or near the bottom of the
front steps and that he was either
staggering or turning around. At that
instant he saw Wiiliam May bearing
the body of little Earl Weber down the
steps. The witness turned away ar.J
the next time he saw the prisoner he
was lying down under a magnolia tree.
Wills went up to him and said, "You
had better come away." Weber shook
his Jiead In the negative.
Wills assisted by Tony Neves ' then
lifted'Weber from the ground and car
ried him out through the gate to the
road. Weber was somewhat excited
and seemed very weak. When they
reached the gate Weber wanted to go
back to the house, but the witness and
Neves took him to Wills' residence.
PRISONER'S HEARTLESSNESS.
John Adams, the guardian of Weber,
applied to-day for letters of adminis
tration on trie estates of Julius and
Mary Weber. His prayer will come up
before the court on Monday. Adams
said to-day:
"""I believe Adolph to be innocent. I
told him that I wasted the guilty party
or parties to be found out and when
they ere I hope they will bo hanged."'
D. W. Lubeck. vice president of the
Placer County Bank, positively denied
to-day the rumor that Julius Weber
had paid any sum of money into that
bank to reimburse It for the money
stolen from it May 26. He stated that
no 3uch transaction had taken place.
The statement was made by Lubeck in
reply to queries regarding a report that
Julius Weber had learned that his son
was the robber who held ud the bank
last May and got away with about
$5000. The story in circulation was to
the effect that Weber had settled with
the bank in order to prevent disgrace
to himself and family.

Finally as the flames sreiv hotter the

arrived.
Deputy May positively asserted that
Ruth brought the baby to the window,
and that he did not see young Weber
there. The testimony was in direct
contradiction of the statement made by
Weber at the first session at the in
quest that he had carried the child
from Uhe burning dwelling.
Mrs. C. Hess of Sonora. a sister of
Mrs. "Vteber and Mrs. Snowden. testi
fied that she was at Mrs. Snowden's
house last Saturday morning and heard
"Weber say to Mrs. Snowden: "You are
responsible for the article in the Bee.
Your time Is coming next."
Miss Bertha Hess also corroborated
the testimony of Mrs. Snowden.
The case was then submitted to the
jury and forty minutes later the ver

NEW YORK, Nov. 17.â The World
to-morrow will say: Ex-Governor
Frank S. Black has been tendered the
offer of the Attorney Generalship in
President Roosevelt's Cabinet for the
term beginning March 4, 1905. While
President Roosevelt has not formally
invited Mr. Black to become a member
of his official family, the tender of the
Attorney Generalship has been made
:> a way that carries with it the assur
ance of the President that he would
like to have New York's ex-Governor
in his Cabinet of younger men which
Roosevelt Is understood to want as as-
Fociates during the new administra
tion.
It is the view of ex-Governor Black's
friends that he will not accept the At
torney Generalship, because It would
mean sacrificing a law practice which,
it Is said, nets him nearly $100,000 a
year, and which, his friends say, he
could retain if hÂ» should be elected to
the United States Senate. For this
reason, the ex-Governor's friends as
sert, he would prefer to take the Sena
torship.
The understanding of these New
York Republicans who know of Presi
dent Roosevelt's plan to prevent a
firht over Chauncey M. Dcpew's seat
is that W. H. Moody accepted the At
torney Generalship only on condition
that his term should terminate on
March 4 next. .

A striking work is a cartoon for
stained glass windows, representing
the seasons, by Albertine Randall
Wheelan. The portraits and studies in
life are also meritorious, j And in the
branch that stands for the personifica
tion of the artist's patience â the de
partment of the miniature â there Is
some excellent work. A portrait of
Miss Marie Wells by Lillie V. O'Ryan
end a portrait of Mrs Harry W.

beautifully done, the harshness of out
line that usually accompanies such
work being eliminated by a skillful
blending of figure and background.
A study* of a lovely baby by May
Slessinger is excellent, the work being
literally microscopic from the tinting of
the violet eyes to the weaving of th'i
dainty golden curls. Portraits of "Dick
and Kathleen." by Mrs. Vincent Neale,
are also pretty studies In child life.
Altogether the exhibit is a pleasing
one and there are few among the many

*A Man's Shadow" Played
in Windsor Castle by Beer

LONDON. Nov. IT.â One of the most j
brilliant theatrical performances ever j
held in Windsor Castle occurred to- j
nt~ht when Beerbohm Tree, by the !
Kibs*> ooaaxand. took down a special j
company to reproduce "A Man's Shad- j
axe.", Â¦ I
The stage was erected in the historic ,
Waterloo chamber and the audience j
v. 35 worthy of its setting. In the front ;
row of rro'.d and red plush chairs sat ;
King Edward: next to him was Queen j
Arr.elie of Portugal, then King Charles j
of Portugal at Queen Alexandra's j
rijrht. They were f.anked on either side ;
by the Prince and Princess of Wales I
and tbc Duke and Duchess of Con- !
naught. All wore the Windsor uni- j
torn, namely, evening dress with red j
collars* and lapels. The orders worn |
by the men and the jewels on the j
Â¦women's dresses added brilliancy to an
audience such as has seldom gathered
in England.
King Edward and King Charles both j
followed the performance vivaciously, j
Mrs. James Brown Potter especially at- I
tractei attention, while cnother Ameri- j
can. Oeraldine Wilson, a small child of j
9, ur<m whom this JÂ»kyll and Hyde j

applause.

Senator Aldrich's only remark on
coming from the White House was:
"We shall do the wise thing." But he
has expressed to his friends hl3 view
that some time during the new adminis
tration the tariff ' will have to be
changed, and he is now regarded as
willing to have the attempt made.
It seems to be certain that the Presi
dent will leave this question entirely In
the hands of Congress and will make
no specific recommendations in his
coming message. As the question de
velops In the short session a decision
will be reached about an extraordinary
session and the President will listen to
all Republican leaders in both houses
before he decides. That there will be
some change In the Dingley schedules
within the next two years seems to be
Bettled. The question to be decided 13
whether it shall be done In an extra
session or whether the presnt Ways
and Means Committee shall be author
ized to sit through the recess.
There is a growing sentiment among
members now arriving that, if the tar
iff Is to be revised at all, the sooner the
better.
CALL. BUREAU, HOTEL. BARTON.
WASHINGTON. Nov. IT. â President
Roosevelt Is apparently yielding to the
opinion that if the tariff is to be even
slightly revised during: the next two
years it should be done at an extra ses
sion of Congress next spring. He Is
now consulting every arriving member
of the Senate and House on the extra
session proposition.
Two very prominent men in Congress
have been won over to some sort of
tariff change. These are Senator Aid
rich of Rhode Island, chairman of the
Committee on Finance of the Senate,
and Representative Payne, chairman of
the "Ways and Means Committee of the
House. They have oeen in consulta
tion with the President in the last few
days and the subject of tariff revision
and extra session has been exhaustive
ly discussed.
Payne believes that some change in
the Dingley schedules can be made very
soon without any disturbance to busi
ness.
An eye-witness to the shooting of
Young was discovered in a most un
usual way to-day while the trial was
in progress. Archibald J. G. Anderson,
one of the men summoned for examina
tion as to his qualifications to serve on
the jury, was oeing questioned by As
sistant District Attorney Rand, when
he~ asked permission to speak with
Justice Davis, who is presiding at the
trial. After a whispered conversation
counsel for the prosecution and de
fense were called to the bench and a
moment later Anderson was excused
and Joined counsel for the prisoner
within the bar of the enclosure. Daniel
I. O'Reilly, one of Miss Patterson's at
torneys, said that an eye-witness to
the shooting hid been discovered. In
formation to this effect had been com
municated to Justice Davis by Ander
son. When court adjourned seven
jurors had been accepted.
John Miilin, who was Caesar Young's
racing partner and who, it is under
stood, will be one of the principal wit
nesses for the prosecution, was made
to sit in the rear of the courtroom upon
request of the prisoner. Miilin had a
seat near the bar of the Inclosure and
had been watching Miss Patterson
closely for some time when ehe asked
that he be ordered away from the rail.
As Miilin passed the defendant in go-
Ing to the rear of the courtroom she
shrank back on the shoulder of her
father. '
Miss Patterson seemed in good spirits
when she entered the courtroom to-day
and a brief chat with her counsel be
fore the trial was resumed added to
her apparent cheerfulness. Mr. Levy
informed the defendant that the morn
ing mail had brought him a letter
which might have an important bearing
on the case. What the letter contained
was not divulged.
NEW YORK, NoV. 17.â With four of
the twelve men who are to decide her
fate already selected, the trial of Nan
Patterson, the former show girl charged
with the murder of Caesar Young, the
wealthy horseman, was continued in
the criminal branch of the Supreme
Court to-day. The greatest care has
been used in the examination of the
talesmen and the exhaustive question
ing and almost indiscriminate challeng
ing for evert the slightest cause indi
cated that not only might another full
court day or even more be consumed
in filling the jury box, but that the
panel of one hundred talesmen might be
"exhausted before the task was complet
ed. Thus far the general public has
.been shut out entirely from the pro
ceedings, only those having a direct
connection with the case being allowed
to enter the courtroom. Yesterday the
available space was well filled by the
court officials, newspaper men and the
talesmen awaiting examination as to
their Qualifications for jury duty, and
the officers who guarded all the doors
had little trouble in keeping back the
crowds which gathered in the corri
dors. Whether the bars would be kept
down during the whole progress of the
trial was not known, but many who
desired to take advantage of the first
opportunity to gain admittance were on
hand early to-day.

Oakland, Cal., in his attempt to have
set aside the divorce decree obtained
from him by his wife; to-day testified
that he broke up housekeeping in May,
1W>1, "because he did n,ot propose to
ktep open house for a bunch of Chris
tian Scientists." He said Mrs. Schafer
had turned. a part of the house into a
meeting place for the Christian Scien
tists and that she had put a sign. on
the front door inviting them to enter
without knocking.
Schafer testified that Mrs. Schafer
would not allow medical attendance
for their children. One time, he said,
their little boy snapped off the end of
his finger while working at his bicycle
and Mrs. Schafer protested very much
when it was wrapped up. Again, said
Schafer. when the little girl was ill he
sent for a doctor, and the wife refused
him admittance.
t In referring to Herbert - Beck, to
whom Mrs. Schafer was subsequently
married, Mr. Schafer said this man had
frequently called- at his home In Oak
land and that he had protested. Mrs.
Schafer, however, answered that; he
came to see both of. them.
. .In less' than six months after the di
vorce she was married to Bed; at
Council Bluffs. Iowa. Schafer further
testified that his first knowledge of the
divorce obtained by his- wife in Omaha
was when he was arrested for kidnap
ing one of his own children.

Applications for approximately $40,000

at the Nevada Bank yesterday.' The to

nearly $1, 400,000. No requests for the

no subscriptions be received after this

Is tempered >jy private information that
the gallant^ commander of the garrison
has been wounded. General Stoessel
was struck on the head by. a splinter
from a shell while he was personally
directing the repulse of a particularly
desperate assault. Fortunately the
wound is not serious and General Stoes
sel has not been obliged to relinquish
command. General Stoessel is regarded
as the heart and soul of the- defense
and his death, or disability which would
cause him to relinquish command,
would be regarded as an irremediable
misfortune.
Other information sent by General
Stoessel. ?rhieh has not been divulged

War Offlce is by no means unfavorable.
White. the garrison is now hemmed in
in the citadel itself, not one of the main

Telegram From
Stoessel Cheers
the- Czar.
General Stoessel was slightly wound
ed in the head during one of the latest
assaults on Port Arthur.
The text of General Stoessel's dis
patches of October 28 is as follows:
'â¢We have thÂ« honor to report. to your
Majesty that the Japanese bombarded
very vigorously on October 2a our forts
and entrenchments north and north
east. The following day they also atr
tacked one of the forts; on the north
side, but our heavy artillery and sh'rap
nel fire dispersed their reserves and the
assault was repulsed. Our losses were
one officer and about seventy men
killed and four hundred wounded."
In x telegram dated October 30 Gen
eral Stoesael sayB:
'Since my dispatch of October 28 the
bombardm>i-i continues with great
fierceness."
Under date of November 3Â» General
Stoecsel telegraphed:
"We greet the Emperor. This day,
a solemn one for all our country, we
oCer prayers to God and send to our
Emperor felicitations hi the shape of
reverberating hurrahs. On bended
knees we pray to God to give health to
your Majesty and their Majesties, the
Empresses and the Grand Duke Czare
vitch. Our joy is all the greater be
cause all the assaults, which lasted
nine days, have been repulsed up to
this great day, the anniversary oi your
accession to the throne, the same date
our Japanese enemies celebrate the an
nlversaiy of the birth of their Mikado
and whereupon they had sworn to take
fhe fortress. God is with us."
CHEFU, Nov, 17.â FIgnttng; at Port
Arthur has taken place nightly since
the Japanese began their general as
sault on October 26, according to Cap
tain Ronberg, a pilot, "who was a pas
senger on the Russian torpedo-boat de
stroyer Rasteropny.
The Japanese trenches, the captain
says, are closest to the forts on Rih
lung and Keewan mountains and to
other forts of the northeastern group.
The sharpshooters of both sides oc
cupying the pits converse with one an
other and frequently make individual
truces, in order to borrow cigarettes or
to relieve their cramped limbs.
The Japanese are displaying great
energy in the construction of trenches
and the mounting of gum.
All of the railroad steamships be
longing to the Russians, except the
8te*l screw transport Amur, have been
sunk by Japanese shells. The hospital
ship Angara (formerly a transport) has
been sunk in shallow water. The pa
tients are still on board the ship and
are comfortable.
The Japanese shells directed against
the harbor are fired with remarkable
accuracy. Recently a silk-clad Chi
nese, who waa seen traveling in a
sampan, was watched by the Russians,
who observed that following the dis
charge of each shell, he placed a hand
kerchief to his nose and then into his
left pocket, occasionally varying tbese
movements, apparently thus signaling
the landing places of the shells. The
shells fell behind obstructions, which
fact prevented the Japanese obtaining
a direct view of their effect. The Chi
nese was hanged.
One day last week a hospital ship
moved too near the battleships In the
harbor, whereupon the Japanese
dropped small shells- around her. with
the obvious purpose of warning her
away. - The ship took 'the hint, and
.when she was outside the zone of dan
ger.large shells began fajllng near the
battleships. . . ' ' â¢ . .
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 17.â As a
result cf the dispatches received from
General Stoeasel, the War Offlce ex
presses entire confidence that Port Ar
thur will be able to he-Id out till the
arrival </f the Russian second Pacific
Squadron.
General Stoessel, in his dispatches to
Emperor Nicholas, reports the repulse
of the Japanese attack on October 25
on the north front of Port Arthur. The
Russian losses were 4&0 killed or
wounded. All of the attacks on No
vember 3; the anniversary of the Em
peror's ascension to the throne, were
repulsed.
The report that the Japanese blew
up fort N'o. 2, the Russian says, is in
correct. The Japanese attempted to
take the fort, but General Smirnoff
personally superintended countermin
ing operations, blew up the Japanese
tunnel and put a etop to their ad
vance.
Much of the success in repelling the
six-day attack. It is said, is due to
General SmlrconTs handling of the ar
tillery. As an example of his work, the
Russian relates that during an attack
on a hill, which was already in the
hacdi of the Japanese on three side?,
<i c neral Smirnoft sent quick-ftring guns
under eover of darkness and got in the
rear of the Japanese reserves, who
were waiting for the final attack, cut
them up and drove them off, prevent
ing them participating in the final
a;>ault. -

Oregon, was found guilty of forgery
In the land fraud cases this afternoon
after the jury had deliberated half an
hour. This applies to all the twenty
one counts on which Meldrum was in
dicted. Meldrum's defense amounted to
little more than the testimony of rep
utable men who swore to his previous
good reputation. Inspector Greene of
the Interior Department to-day told
how, in 1902, he began an investigation.
Among the papers seized in Meldrum's
desk were a number of application
blanks for surveys partly filled out. In
some cases there was no description of
the lands although the settler's name
and the notary's certificate were at
tached. These were forwarded to
Washington with his report- All this
evidence afterward disappeared. At
the time Representative Herrmann was
Land Commissfoner. The evidence of
handwriting experts was brought in to
cinch the forgery charges. Meldrum.
according to the verdict, forged set

PITTING IT STIXONG.
Uul DoeMi't It IÂ»ok Reasonable?
This may read as though we were
putting it a little Ktronsr, because it is
generally thougrht by the majority of
people that IJyspepKia in ita chronic
Xorm Â« incurable or practically bo.
Bat we have long eince Known that
Dyfpe-ptia is curable, nor Is it such a
dllllcuit matter as at first appears.
The trouble with Dyspeptics is that
they me continually dieting, starving 1
thernsÂ«>i\-eF, or going to opposite ex-
treme, or else deluging the already
overburdened Ftomach with "bitters,"
"after-dinner pills," etc., which inva-
riably increase the difficulty even if
in some cases they do give .a slight,
u-mponry relief. Such treatment of
the stomach simply makes matters
Â»orse. What the stomach wants is
a rest. Now. how can the stomach
become rested, recuperated rnd at the
tame time the body nourished and
â¢sustained?
This is thÂ« gr.-eat secret and this is
also the secret of the uniform success
oi Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. This
Jb a comparatively new remedy, but
It* Fuccess and popularity leave no
doubt as to its merit.
The TableUi will digest the food
eny wny. regardless of condition of
stomach. . .
The sufferer from Dyspepsia, ac-
cording to directions, is to eat ..an
abundance of good, wholesome food
and use the tablets before and after
each meal, and the result will be that
the food will be dJcrested, no matter
how bad your Dyspepsia may be, be-
causi-. -at before stated, the tablets
will dijrest the food even If the stom-
ach Is wholly inactive. To illustrate
our meaning plainly, if you take 1800
grains of ; meat, eggs or ordinary
food r^i<3 place it in a temperature of
SS degreea, and put with it one- of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, ll will di-
r^yt the meit or eggs almost as per-
fectly ns if the meat was inclosed
within the stomach.
Thf stomach may be ever so weak,
yet these tablets will perform the
xiork of digestion and the body and
brufh will be properly nourished, and
af the same time a radical, lasting
cure of Dyspepsia will be made, be-
cause the much abused stomach -will
be given, to some extent, a much
needed r*-5t. Tour druggist will tell
you that of all the many remedies
advertised to cure Dyspepsia none of
tbtm havfe given so complete and gen-
era! satisfaction as Stuart's â¢ Dyspep-
ria Tablet*, and not lea?t in impor-
t.-inoe to these hard times is the fact
thru th^-y are also the cheapest and
i?:ve-the most "good for the least
nÂ»or>ry. > â¢

Fixes Term at Four Years for Pupils
in tbe Polytechnic Higb
Sciiool.
The Board of Education yesterday
adopted a resolution providing that
the college preparatory course that
prepares boys for admission to the i
engineering branch of the State Uni- j
versity in the Polytechnic High School â¢
be fixed at four years, and after the
commencement of the spring term of
1805.
Principal Murphy of the Irving
Scott School filed a complaint against
a bill for water for the school, claim
ing it was excessive, as the water had
rot been used.
The board ordered temporary re
pairs of vaults at the Sheridan and
Burnett school? reported to be in dan
gerous condition.
The petition of Margaret A. Smith
to be retired from the School Depart
ment and placed on the annuity list
on account of continued ill health was
referred to the retirement committee.
The Alliance Francaise was granted
permission to use fh<? Emerson School
for the purpose of giving free instruc
tion in French after school hours.
The board held a consultation with
several principals relative to the ad
visability of rearranging the school
terra by fixing the vacation in July
and August instead of June and July
as at present. The principals favored
a fall and spring term of twenty-one
weeks each, with a summer vacation
of six weeks, beginning on the first
Monday after July 4. together with. a
Christmas vacation and two Intermed
iate vacations as at present, and this
will probably be ratified by the board.

Discussing the latter project yester

well pleisetl with the work on the road
southward from Eureka^ but was un
able to say whether the Santa Fe will
build clear through to this city or en
ter into some arrangement with the
California . .Northwestern Railway
whereby connections may be mads at

The vaudeville entertainment for the

Rarely has an entertainment of such

any benefit and besides the admirable
musical numbers and specialties the
audience listened to an address from
Major General Arthur MacArthur, who
spoke words of admiration of the late
Father McKianon.
The general said In part:
The purpose of this public proceeding iÂ» a
generous expression of a man universally es
teemed and whose memory we desire to cher
ish by means of a memorial that shall pre
serve for future generations the record of bia
good work and personal merits.
His active life and thÂ« cause of his death.
appeal to those who knew him, as an at my
chaplain. From my private knowledge of him
and performance of his duties to the United
States I take pleasure In saying that he was
an exemplary clergyman, and a laithful and ef .
flcient officer of the army. The. men of the
First California Volunteers will recall him for
reason of his indefatigable efforts In their be
half.
We recall the good chaplain when remem
bering the early days of the occupancy of
Manila. By his activity many facilltie3 and
comforts were assured the men of his rrgi
ment. Father McKlnnon's duties were ren
dered under the flag of a great nation. Under
Its folds injustice an4 oppression are Impos
sible. When he entered the American army,
the First California Volunteers, be had no
mistrust of his comrades.
At the beginning of every struggle the
American people enter discussions as to ex
pediency, but he knew that American gun*
never fired in war without contributing sub
stantially to th* welfare of mankind. It, must
be noted we are planting in the islands those
imperishable principles upon which free
institutions are baaed â planting comethrng
that can never be destroyed.
You might as welt try to obliterate the t^n
commandments as limit free institutions to
men who have a white skin, or to Â«ay that
religious irberty is a matter of longitude or
latitude. I have no hesitation In making pub
lic declaration that American Institution* are
so strong and so flexible and so beneficent
to mankind that they can be applied to every
possible circumstance.
I make the further declaration .that we
shall ultimately witness la tire Philippines the
establishment of a self governing people, with
a population capable of maintaining Institu
tions safe against Internal opposition or ex
ternal violence. The Â«ucces9 of planting re
publican institutions In the Philippines must
exert potential Influence In .Asia. , , ,
Father McKennon was one of the pioneers
In that great historical movement, and la pur
suance of his duty he died a faithful soldier
of the cross and faithful officer of the Ameri
can army, and be -lies In a mantle of the flag
he served.
In Imitation of the good chaplain we may
contribute something day bj day toward the
welfare Â«nd the strength of the repuhllc.

Big Corporation Will Acquire Patents
and Engage In Manufacturing
Business.
Articles of incorporation were filed
yesterday with t%e County Clerk by the
Rifled Pipe Company, which announces
Its' purpose to acquire patents, manu
facture pipe and operate pipe lines.
The capital stock is $200,000. of which j
51000 each has been subscribed by the :
following directors: John D. Isaacs.
William F. Herrin. J. E. Foulds. J.
H. Wallace and Foshay Walker.
J. E. Foulds said last nieht: "The
company has been formed to exploit an
invention of John D. Isaacs of the en
gineering department of the Southern
Pacific Company. The patent covers
the manufacture of a rifled pipe,
to be used as an oil conduit.
Centrifugal action of water is to
be used In accelerating the move
ment of sluggish fluids. The com
pany is composed of individuals who
are acting solely in their prKate capac
ity. Its plans are not fully developed
and for that reason I cannot say when
we shall begin to construct works for
making the pipe. As I understand Mr.
Isaacs' invention it I? Intended to over
come a serious difficulty that has been
encountered In the flow of heavy oils
through pipe lines. By his peculiar
rifling of the inside of the Dice, to
gether with the use of water, he solves
the problem."
Isaacs is one of the leadlnsr con
structing engineers of the Southern Pa
cific Company. He took an important
part in the recently completed work
of "standardizing" the Harrlman sys
tems. Isaacs Is a member of the Board
of Education of Oakland, where he re
sides.

from 1100 to 1110, yesterday morning.
Frederick TV. Bradley, a mining en
gineer, was seriously injured, the en
tire front cf the building wrecked and
dama^re amounting to several thou
sand dollars done.
No cme seems able to give a clear
xccourt ci" tee accident. When the
explosion occurred the majority of the
occupants cf the fiats were in bed. They
were aroused by the crashing of glass,
the sound of falling plaster and the
rending of timber. The Fire Depart
ment was summoned, but as only a
slight blare had resulted from the ig
niting of some curtains, tneir services
wÂ«?re not necessary, only to the ex
tent cf assisting in clearing away the
d^tris.
BRADLLA* LIGHTS MATCH.
F. W. Bradley, who was injured, was
the innocent cause cf the explosion.
At about 7: SO in the morning he bid
hi* wife grctid by. At the foot of the
stairs he scratched a match to Iisht his
Â«.!?ar and in an instant there was a
blinding flash and the roar of an ex
plosion. Dazed, scorched and bleed
ing Bradley groped his way back to his
rooms. , where medical aid was at once
eurmnoned. Dr. E. Kelley. who oc
cupies- a fiat in the same building; was
the first to respced and other physi
cians were sc-on on the scene. They say
tfcat while Bradley' s injuries are sen-;
ana there is no danger of fatal re- !
suits. Hs is suffering rrom the shock
and bruises censed by falling plaster,
but no bones are broken- At present
hi* hearing is impaired, his face bad

sicner M. E- Cununings. an occupant
of one of the rlats. was probably the
heaviest sufferer. Had a bombshell
exploded in his rooms the wreck cou'd
not be more comr-tete. Everything
fragile was destroyed and falling plas
ter completed the work of ruin.
GLASS IS .SHATTERED.
On the corner opposite the ruined
buildinp is a handsome two-story house
ov.-r.ed by Mrs. Goldberg and used as a
curses' home. Twenty-two of its
windows were broken.
Fire Marshal Town? visited the prem
ises and made a careful inspection. It
:s his opinion that gas had escaped
team a gas grate in the parlor of the
flat occupied by ilr. Cummings and
filled the hallwavs and vestibule. When
Mr. Bradley lighted the match in the
ttv rr.ing the flame set fire to the gas
and caused the explosion. Some of
the occupants of the fiats are of the
opinion that there was a leak between
the v oils, and the gas escaping through
a crack was ignited.
The fiat building is a three-story
frame with attic and basement and
was built about a year ago. It is the
property of Walter H. Lanforth. The
flats were occupied by M. E. Cum
mings. J. V. de L&veaga^ F. W. Brad

as to the assessment of James D. Phe
lan's property. The Assessor was not
in, and it is expected that he will be
heard to-morrow evening. Other
jiTors do not express sympathy with
Xealon's controversies with Dodge.
The Grand Jury was in regrular ses
sion yesterday afternoon winding up
its affairs preparatory to disbanding a
week from to-day as has been directed
by Presiding Judge Kerrigan. A spe
cial meeting will be held to-morrow
evening in order to get reports in
shape by the time the court says there
shall be a final adjournment.
Alfred Lilienfeld presided yesterday,
as usual. Judge Kerrigan having re
fused to accept his resignation as
foreman. It had been the purpose to
take up no new matters, but Juror
Xealon was so insistent that he had
something up his sleeve calling for
an immediate and thorough investiga
tion that his colleagues yielded to hl3
wishes. It appears that Daniel H.
Skillen has been bidding for carpet
laying work in the public offices al
though he has no place of ' business
and, according to Nealon's informa
tion, there were suspicious circum
stances connected with a recent bill
for $43 that had been paid him. .
Skillen explained that while he had
no office or store he tookcontracta for
laying carpet and purchased his stock
as he needed it. Supervisor Braun
hart was also called to testify, and he
said that Skillen was the loweat bid
der on the job in question. The jury
came to the conclusion that it was
wasting time over something that did
not justify Investigation and made
apology to the witnesses for summon
ing them.
An attempt was made to indict Wil
liam Glovanoni, who about eight
months ago fired a shot at Willian
McKown at 416 Davis street and was
discharged by Judge Conlan. Both
are teamsters employed by produce
frms. The Jury refused to have any
thing to do with the case, after hear
ing the testimony.

Concerning his stand on publicity.
President McEIroy said to-day: "If
this evidence is made public I feel that
another strong bulwark will have been
raised against a repetition of such
offenses as have scandalized the Police
Department. Next to criminal prose
cution I consider dismissal in disgrace
and the utmost publicity as the best
punishment."
John E. McEIroy, as president of the
Board of Police and Fire Commission
ers, has decided that all of the evidence
collected against the four policemen,
C. E. Clark, C. W. Hamerton, J. F.
Stahl and Lee E. Andrews, who were
dismissed from the department for pil
fering from merchants' stores, shall be
made public. President McEIroy will
present his views to-morrow at the
meeting of thÂ» Police Commissioners
and will endeavor to persuade Mayor
Olney and City Engineer Turner that
this is the proper course to pursue.
McEIroy also favors a prosecution of
the quartet and he will officially in
vite the attention of the Police Com-'
missioners to his ideas on that phase
of the police scandal.
In view of the stand McEIroy has
taken the meeting of the Commission
ers is looked forward to with much in
teiest. Besides the matter of a final
disposition of the cases the, board has
to deal with the charges filed against
Policeman Frank Sill. In this case the
evidence, according to Chief of Police
Kodgkins, Is weak and not of a char
acter to impress him with the guilt of
the patrolman. The police officials
have said they would go to the limit
in pressing charges against men where
evidence warranted drastic action, but
they do not feel as if officers should
have their namts linked with the mal
odorous revelations of the last ten days
unless the proof shall be very clear
as to guilt.
The appointment of a sergeant to
fill the vacancy caused by Clark's dis
missal will be given consideration to
morrow. Patrolman Michael Shannon,
who assisted In uncovering the opera
tions of the dismissed men. has been
mentioned for the place, as has Police
man Pert Henderson, and Lon Agnew,
clerk to the Chief of Police.

Werly told the police that he had
been searching for his wife for two
weeks. Last night he got a clew to her
whereabouts. He armed himself with
a pick handle, thinking trouble might
be brewing should his suspicions prove
to be well founded. The pursuing hus
band declared he came across his miss
ing spouse walking with Clough near
the corner where he attacked the man.
Mrs. Werly, her husband said, hid in a
doorway as he approached, and left
Clough to make explanations.
As soon as the men met the battle
opened. There was only one blow
struck and Clough then yelled for the
police. The Irate husband went toÂ» jail
on a charge of assault with a deadly
weapon.
Clough was formerly a Janitor in the
Oakland School Department. He de
nied that Mrs. Werly was with him,,
asserting that he was escorting an
other woman for whom tie had ob
tained a position. Werly persisted in
his assertions that he knew his own
wife when he saw her on the Btreet,
even if she had been away from home
for two weeks. The case was continued
in the Police Court this morning, as no
complaint had been sworn to against
the husband. â¢-Â¦-. : : 'Â¦;Â¦-'.
J. H. Werly, residing at 856 Market
street, was arrested early this morning
on a charge of smashing F. R. dough's
head open with a pick handle at Sev
enth and Franklin streets, where,
Werly asserts, he caught Clough in
company with Mrs. Werly. ciough was
so- badly injured that he was compelled
to go to the Receiving Hospital for
treatment.

Â» 1016 Broadway, Nov. 17. '
There was talk on {he campus to
day among the more hot headed men
of going to Stanford in a body should
they be refused degrees at the Univer
sity of California as a result of the
argument with Captain Nance. The
more conservative leaders of the class,
including Joseph P. Loeb, Eugene Hal
let. W. H. Dehm and W. T. Hale, dis
couraged the talk, declaring that no
such proceeding could be thought' of for
a moment, no matter whatithe outcome
of the discussion with their military in
structor may be.
" Captain Nance has said that during
the next twenty-four hours he will an
nounce what is to be the fate of the
sixty-three men whose excuses are de
clared by him to be unsatisfactory. It
is supposed he will recommend that
they be dropped from the military
class, and in consequence lose their di
plomas. â¢ \
A new development in the altercation
between the seniors and Captain Nance
occurred to-day when W. T. Hale, edi
tor of the students' daily- newspaper,
The Californlan. onejjf the most prom
inent men in the senior class, received
a formal notice requiring him to ap
pear before the students' affair commit
tee to-morrcnv ' morning at 11 o'clock.
Hale supposes, a^.do others who have
â¢received similar notice, that Professor
W. A. Setchell, a member of the com
mittee, who was pelted with grass and
mud when the men rebelled against
Nance's original order three Hveeks ago,
is making good his threat that there
would be more to come to the affair.
instructors in military science and tactics there
are onty nine at which the true military spirit

vLere it is developed as far as practicable.
nine where it is fairly developed, twelve where
it is devtlcpfd to a slight extent, and on down
Mith very little development at four, little if
any at five and none at all at four.
General Burton's view of conditions at these
institutions, taking them altogether, is on the
whole favorable, but In view of the fact that
the first step in developing the true military
spirit is to inculcate the lesson of obedience
and respect for authority. It may be worth
while to Inquire whether- some judicious re
vision is needed in the list of schools and
colleges entitled to the sen-ices of army officers
a.: military Instructors. Meanwhile thÂ« prompt
and vigorous action of the War Department in
th>; case of the alleged offenders at the Uni
versity of California deserves the heartiest
commendation. 'If it brings home to the young
men a realization that orders are orders and
must be obeyed, be they agreeable or other
wise, the offending students will have learned
the fundamental lesson of the military service,
a lessen without which all others are useless.

According to the Army arid "Navy

to-day about the university campus
and eaperly read by students. President
Wheeler has* received explicit orders
li om the War Department at Washing
ton to drop from the military class
students found guilty of insubordina

members of the senior class. Their
names have been printed hitherto and
made jiublic by Captain J. T. Nance,

The Army and Navy # Journal's an

J. H. Werly Claims He Was
Justified in Assaulting
F. E. Clough, a Janitor
OAKLAND, Nov. 17.â Because the
laws of the State of California forbade
Mrs. Laura C. Campbell â¢ to testify,
against her husband, Lemuel Campbell,
when he was arrested for disturbing
the peace a short time agxj, the latter
was acquitted of the charge against
him, only to return in a flt of jealous
rage, shoot his wife, inflicting a wound
from which "she died yesterday morn
ing. That. Mrs. Campbell feared that
her husband would kill her is evidenced
by a statement made by her to her at
torney, John S. Delancy Jr., a few days
before the shooting. Mrs. Campbell
said: -

der. I know my husband will kill me,
but I can't da. anything about it. What
shall I do?"
Mrs. Campbell's fear of her husband
has proved to be well grounded. Camp
bell, the police have learned, spent an
hour in a saloon at Fifteenth street and
San Pablo avenue, across the street
from the City Prison, babbling in his
cups about the shooting the night it
occurred. No one paid any attention
to his talk and he departed unmolested,
but was arrested several hours later.

REDDING, Nov. 17. â An explosion of
gas in the Peck and Quary level of the
lion Mountain mine at Iron Mountain
Wednesday afternoon started a fire that
burned furiously for three hours and
came near suffocating seventy-five
miners. John Johnson was overcome
by the gas and smoke and is now lying
in the Mountain Copper Company's
hospital.
The men at work on the Peck and
Quarry level were suddenly alarmed by
a loud explosion, the force of which
threw them down. Following the ex
plosion came the flames. A general
rush was made for safety, and every
miner but one was successful in getting
out into toe air. Upon making a can
vass of the persons employed on the
level the foreman discovered that one
man was missing- .Several miners vol
unteered to go in search of their -miss
ing comoanion, and discovered him ly
ing in a drift where he had fallen un
conscious from the poisonous gases.
Heroic methods were made to save
the Mountain Copper Company's prop
erty. At times It was feared the flames
would get beyond control and would
spread to other parts of the works and
it was only by fast and furious fight
ing that the fire was subdued. Consid
erable damage was done by the fire,
but not of a kind to suspend operations.
The men on the night shift were able
to go to work. '

David Birnbaum, retail fruiterer at
Ninth avenue Â«ind K street, told Judge
Mogan that he had repeatedly been
refused a hearing at the home cf J. B.
Warren. 3^6 Zj street, ere he met that
gentleman on the street and presented
a bill of $14 for goods sold and delivered.
Instead of accepting the bill or promis

abuse at Sir. BIrabaum until the latter
stopped the vituperation by planting

rested and charged with battery. Judge
Mogan will hear more details next
Friday.
Judse Fritz is wrestling with a lar
ct-ny case that nenaces the normal ar
rangement of his gray matter. The
complainant is L. T. Fell, who alleges
that certain rocftnsr shingles purloined
frrrm his new dwelling near the ocean
beach were found in the possession of
William Eldon. In facetious spirit. Mr.
Fell avers, he surmounted his pile of
shingles with placard inscribed,
"Thieves may take one or two bun
dles," and the next morning he dis
covered that some one had taken his
Joke in literal sense, also several bun
dles of the shingles. There was a
wheelbarrow trail which led him to the
residence of Sir. Eldon. There he
found shingles exactly similar to those
he had lost. Mr. Eld/sn, however, de
fied him to prove property, and it is
the effort to decide the disputed ov.'ner-
Ehip that is brain-fagging the magis
trate of department No. 4. Thus far
two manufacturers of shingles have
identified the shingles In question as of
their output. The case has already
consumed much time and the termina
tion setms to grow more remote with
each hearing.

William Andrews confessed that h?

Bradford T. Schell, arrested for as

street, where she is engaged as a chil

openly insinuating in Judge Mogan'3
court that the woman was on undue
terms of intimacy with her employer. It
was after Bailiff Hickey had intercept
ed a written appeal for clemency which
the prisoner attempted to pass to the
woman that the aspersion on her char
acter was uttered, and the Judge
sharply rebuked it. Further hearing
was then continued till to-day.

JAPANESE bonds are selling briskly here and in New York and
London. Within three days after the war loan was opened for
subscription in this city $1,313,000 was invested. From the other
two centers come reports of heavy oversubscription, showing that
financiers have every confidence in the value of the Â¦' commodity of
fered. Indeed, it is the opinion of President Hellman of the Nevada
Bank, who is handling the negotiation of the loan here, that the
readiness with which the bonds have been taken up will be a surprise
even to Japanese treasury officials.
This indication of the steadiness of Japan's credit in the monev
market has a direct bearing upon the diplomatic aspect of the present
conflict in Manchuria. From the Continent have come persistent
iterations^of the belief that Japan's seeming anxiety to end the war
was prompted more by fear of failing resources than humanitarian
dictates. It has been said that already the island kingdom is feeling
severe strain and that unless a speedy termination is brought to hos
tilities the Mikado's splendid aggressive fight must fail through sh^er
lack of fighting funds. Upon this belief Russia has based her hopes
to a larger degree than she is willing to admit.
Now that Japan is floating her second war loan with an ease
even 'greater than that attending the first influences inimical to
h^r success arc given pause. It becomes apparent that even as her
actual fighting strength in terms of war vessels and munitions was
underestimated at first, so Japan's reserve force of finances reveals
unexpected strength! The doughty little nation, which has been pre
paring for this struggle ever since the concert of powers deprived her
of Korea after the Chinese war, certainly has not overlooked the
ftrcntrtheninz of her sinews of endurance. *

DURING the campaign there was some loose and wild talk about
the new treaty with China, made necessary by the denuncia
tion of the existing convention. It was stated.- for political
effect, that the new treaty would terminate the exclusion policy of
the United States. It is known now as it was then, by all who chose
to be fair, that the new treaty does no such thing. Secretary Hay has
taken advantage of the opportunity to improve our trade relations
with China, in the interest of this coast. There will be liberal
treatment of Chinese merchants and some of the obstructive defini
tions will be abolished. This is approved by sentiment here and
throughout the country.
Our trade exchanges with China depend novÂ£ and will always
depend upon the domestication of Chinese merchants and bankers
in our commercial centers. They seek to do just what, all com
mercial people practice. Since China first gave open ports, Euro
pean and American merchants have established themselves there to
promote trade. They are in Shanghai, Canton and other Chinese
ports. If the trade of China is worth seeking, Chinese merchants
are entitled to equality of treatment. This will be secured in the
new treaty, and following our many acts of friendship for that em
pire it will have a wholesome effect upon our Oriental commerce.
All the world considers Chinese trade as the great prize of fu
ture commerce. Our fair share of it may well reach stupendous
proportions, but we cannot get it by treating Chinese merchants
and bankers with contempt and devoting them to outlawry. Sec
retary Hay knows the sentiment of our merchants in the matter
and simply proposes to respect it. It has been stated by our com
mercial bodies time and again, and was instrumental in modifying
some of the merely fanatical features thafc were proposed in the
present exclusion law. It will be necessary for our merchantsAo
watch the new treaty when it reaches the Senate, for influences may
appear there seeking to amend it so as to treat merchants as coolies
are treated, which will be unjust to them and, like all injustice, will
react upon those who permit it.

The issue presented is exactly the same as that already made
the object of Federal attention and expenditure in the Mississippi
River and its valley. When that stream flows over its banksand the
scouring; force of its current is destroyed, its channel fills with silt
and the water that should scour it is spread over vast tracts of agri
cultural land to its destruction. In the rectification of the Mississippi
many States are concerned, with vast interest in its navigation and
with millions of acres at the mercy of its overflow. , The combined
political power of those States has been used in the creation of a
permanent 'Federal commission, to which millions of dollars are
appropriated by Congjess to be spent in works for the control of
the river, and the protection of lands from its floods.
The river problem in California is exactly the same. It is a
problem of navigability and flood protection. The principle which
justifies Federal appropriation for the Mississippi also justifies it
for the two great rivers of California. If rectified to protect naviga
tion, of necessity the lands now destroyed by floods will be reclaimed
from that danger. Mr. McKinlay, Congressman-elect, has already
perfected an agreement with our members and Senators to make
this the leading work of their term. Representing them all, he has
consulted with the land owners and the river men, and will make
the report of the engineers now at work on the problem the basis
of the movement to be made upon Congress.
This State is one only, while the Mississippi has many to work
for it. But this is a new California. We have a member of the
Cabinet in Mr. Metcalf. who is thoroughly familiar with the whole
subject, and we have a solid delegation in Congress of the dominant
party, and a happy state of- almost unanimous political agreement
among our people. The time and circumstances are propitious. Our
members of Congress will make themselves masters of the subject
as it is treated in the forthcoming report of the engineers. Two of
these. Richardson of Louisiana and Dabney of Mississippi, are fa
miliar with the like conditions in the Mississippi River, and their
study of our needs is in the light of experience in the larger prob
lem.
It is a maxim of engineering that anything can be done with the
money to do it. Proof of this was furnished when our first overland
railways were built, accomplishing what was thought impossible.
Xew proof has been added by the construction of the Lucin cut-off
across Great Salt Lake, one of the stupendous engineering feats of
the present century. The Alpine tunnels and the vast reclamations
made from the ocean by Holland all verify the maxim. Our river
problem does not cover a great field, but it involves great engineering
feats that can be effected by money. The Mississippi reclamation
has led the way. To make it there had to be present, first,- the
necessity, and then the political power to get the funds. We have
the demonstrated necessity, and we want the money, and with our
whole delegation and a member of the Cabinet out for the money,
it must come some time, the sooner the better.
The Call invites the united support of the press of the State
to procure this appropriation from the next Congress. The rectifica
tion of our rivers concerns the whole State. When the lands that
they now destroy by floods are protected it means the addition of
taxable property in land and an increase in the general wealth. It
means more merchandise for export, more business for steamboats,
railroads and ocean carriers, and more independence and space for
homes and competence for people. Its economic value to the State
is not susceptible of everestimate. Push the work along and help
our Congressmen to accomplish it.

need to use the navigability of the streams.

With University Club again the
scene, and Miss Quinan again the motif,
another delightful luncheon was given
yesterday by Mrs. Edward Pringle and
Miss Frances Moore.
This day the prevailing shade was
pink, bridesmaid roses and dainty can
delabra giving a rose-colored hue to all
surrounding?.
Gathered abr it the board with Miss
t Mr. and Mrs. John C. Wilson are now
"at sea," en route to the Mediterranean,
later to automobile a portion of the Eu
ropean continent.
Miss Gertrude Dutton will be the
guest of honor at a. dinner given by
Thomas Barbour.
The affair will take place in the Bo
hemian Club on November 21, and is
one of the many ante-nuptial events
that have been prepared for Miss "Dut
tqn, who is soon to wed.
Mrs. James M. Goewey will entertain
Miss Grace Llewellyn" Jones at dinner
in the Palm Garden on Monday even
ing, November 21. /
Other guests will be Mrs. Llewellyn
Jones, Mrs. George McAneny, Captain
Howland and Paul Kosakevitch, Rus
sian Consul.
Determined to make the closing days
of Miss Quinan's visit as delightful as
possible, Mrs. Chenery and Miss Pat
ton spared no pains.
The table, a large round one, was
beautifully dressed in shades of yellow
and brown, the one gracefully merging
into the other with most artistic ef
fect. This was accomplished by a clev
er arrangement of chrysanthemums
and grape leaves, the culminating 1
touch given by delicate yellow silk
Japanese lanterns, glowing softly.
This occasion will long be memora
ble to Miss Quinan, even though she
has been the recipient of extreme at
tention during her California visit.
Those who were bidden to this pretty
feast were Miss Quinan. Mrs. Henry

"many regrets expressed on her coming
departure, there was a, decided air of
merriment uppermost. J

ing, of course, that I am the one man."
"They will be saying that 'we are en
gaged," hinted Miss MilHngton.
"Heaven forfend that they speak not
the truth," he answered, keeping his
eyes fixed upon the vista of the ball
room showing through the arched door
way.
"But v.e are not!"
"It's not my fault," he said humbly.
"I should say not," she retorted sar
castically. "'To propose three times in
one evening!"
"Four," corrected Tanner comforta
bly. "I think I just proposed again."
"I don't remember,", she protested.
"Maybe not," he agreed. "I've got
so in the habit of it tnat I guess . I
am growing stale. I thought I said
something about hoping that they,
spoke the truth when they said we
were engaged."
"Ob. that," she said with infinite
scorn.
"I can't give you one out . of 'The
Lover's Handy Manual' every time,"
he apologized. "I'm saving those up
for grand occasions."
" 'Out of the fullness of the heart the
mouth speaketh.' " she quoted lightly.
"Not always," he urged. ' Sometimes
I can't say a word."
"And, other times. I wish you
couln't," she finished cruelly.
"How would you like California for
a honeymoon?" he asked irrelevantly.
"It would all depend," she laughed.
"I 'think I prefer Europe. I detest
trains."
"So do I." he answered with a re
lapse into lightness, "in a ballroom.
Stepped on Mrs. Bascom's and she
looked at me as though I was a train
robber and not merely a wrecker."
"Is one worse than the other?!' she
demanded.
"I don't know," he admitted. "I had
to say something."
"Yes?" she asked with a rising in
flection that conveyed a negative.
"You see," he argued to save his
ground, . "if you're wrecked you may
lose your life, but you won't mind it. If
you are robbed you lose your money
and you do."
"Is money more important than life?"
she exclaimed.
"Some people appear to think so,"
he said pointedly.
She laid a gloved hand upon his arm.
"See here, Dick," she said pleading
ly, "don't think I am going to accept
Clarence Stone for his money!"
"Are you marrying him because you
love him?" he asked, turning that he
mighjt look straight into her eyes.
She tried to meet his glance 1 , but her
lashes fell.
"Dick," she called softly, but not so
low that his quick ears did not catch
the words. He turned* and came to
ward her. " Every instant he remained
was exquisite torture, and he chafed at
the delay, yet even now her . slightest
word was a command. "Dick," she
said softly, as he bent his head, "I
don't think a trip to California would
make a bad honeymoon."
She was smiling at him as she bad
smiled in the early evening, but now
there was a new light of tenderness in
her eyes. His face glowed with hope.
"There's luck in odd numbers," he
cried. "I've already proposed four
times. For a fifth time, will you marry
me, sweetheart?"
He bent his head so low to catch her
answer that her lips brushed his cheek
as she whispered "Yes." â Copyright,

"Until your father died," he per
sisted, "she spent every cent he could
earn. That's why she has no more
now."
"Mother can't help â " she began.
"I don't ask her to,"' he broke in
willfully â¢ misunderstanding: her. "I
leave to-morrow for California to take
over the Santa Mana vineyard. It's
going to be hard sledding at the start,
but I can s keep a wife in comfort, and
I hoped that you would cdme with
me."
"You are going West to-morrow?"
she cried, startled out of her pose.
. "And alone," he said simply. "I had
hoped for your love and sympathy.
At any rate I could stand the uncer
tainty here no longer. All my money
is tied up i^ the vineyards now, and I
can't afford to come back East and
hang around."
"Did you suppose I could leave so
soon?" she asked.
"You won't need more than you have
to go out there," he explained. "You
cculd pack up in the morning, be mar
ried in the afternoon and leave in the
evening."
"Of all the ridiculous things!" she
exclaimed.
"It isn't Ridiculous," he said soberly.
"I can't stand this sort of thing any
longer." j
Without warning he clasped her close.
For a moment she felt the pressure of
his lips against hers, the tightening of
his powerful arms, then without a word
he rose and walked quickly toward the

5iame of the people, as he contended
that the action was criminal in its
'.nature.
f District Attorney Byington contend
ed that the proceedings were not crim
inal and said he had adopted the
ocurse laid down in the case of Bur
leigh decided by the Supreme Court
on September 30 last. In that case,
â¢which was for the removal of a super-
S'ibor for misconduct in office the
judgment reads: "The main purpose
/Of the accusation under section 758
5Â£is to remove a person from public of
!flce for misconduct in Buch office; the
misconduct charged need not neces
sarily include an act which would, it
self, constitute a crime and if it does
include such crime the Judgment on
the accusation would not be a bar to
a subsequent prosecution for such
crime. The judgment can only go to
the extent of a removal from office.
The Legislature, perhaps; might have
â¢provided that the proceeding for the
f removal of an officer might be by in
idictment and if that had been the in
tent a few words would have ex
pressed it. That, however, wa3'clearly
;not the intent, for the Legislature by
768 and succeeding sections has
elaborately provided an entirely dif-
procedure."
"If," continued Byington, "the pro
ceedings are not criminal. It Is -not
necessary for them to be in the name
of the people. The accused are not
deprived of any rights as in a criminal
proceeding. The inference is plain
from the decision In the Burleigh
case that the accusation is a civil pro
cess or special proceeding."
The Judge said he was not yet satis
fied whether the proceedings under
the statute were civil or criminal.
Attorney Johnson , had asked for a
continuance till November 26 and he
would reserve his decision till that
time. He would also iyÂ«e to be en
lightened as to whether the trial
should be, with a Jury of twelve or
less, as in misdemeanor cases, or
with a Jury of twelve as In felony
cuaes with a unanimous verdict or
with a verdict of nine as in civil
ca^s.

ONTS OF THE CLEVER AND POPU
LAJS MEMBERS OB" 'THE RUN

Six years ago in Sacramento, Sailor
George Utz took unto himself a blush
ing "bride and settled down to short
period of domestic bliss. Then he
shipped on a vessel bound for tha
frozen north. For a Ions tixnÂ« the
young wife received no word from her
husband. Finally It was reported that
he had died up in the Arctic region
and would be seen no more.
Then Edward Strasburfir appeared
on the scene and wooed the blooming
young widow. They were married
after a while and for two yeara lived
happily.
Last August Utz suddenly arrived in
port from some faraway land and Im
mediately started out to find his wife.
His quest was successful and unlike
the lamented Enoch Arden, he claim
ed his own. Strasburg yesterday
brought suit for a separation from the
wife he could not keep.
Mrs. Lucretia Flower yesterday re
quested a divorce from Theron M.
Flower in Judge Seawell's court. The
Judge heard the evidence and took the
case under submission. Mrs. Flower la
a handsome blonde and she told a story
that was substantiated by her aunt,
Mrs. Lucinda Barnard of Rochester, N.
Y. The Flowers were married at Pon
tiac, Mich., and her husband sold out
a large mercantile business at Battle
Creek to locate at San Diego. Later he
went to his father's ranch In Lower
California, twenty-five miles from En
senada, and sent for her. Mrs. Flowers
objected to the rough manner of living.
Judge Troutt yesterday granted a di
vorce, 5600 alimony and the custody of
three children to Nettie M. Buchanan,
wife of R. A. Buchanan, assistant phy
sician at the California Medical Mis
sionary and Benevolent Society.
Annie Staffler sued Frank Staffler for
divorce on the ground of Inhuman
treatment. He owns a gTppery and
saloon at Sanchez and Seventeenth
streets with an income of J25 a day, a.id
has a third" interest in the estate of
George Staffler worth $7000. The wife
asks for 5100 a month alimony and $300
for attorney's fees.
Other suits for divorce were filed by
Beatrice M. Noble against Gerald E.
Noble, for cruelty; Z. H. Langdon
against R. B. Langdon, neglect; Emma
Nelson against George Nelson, cruelty;
Mary E. Weatherly sued for annulment
of her marriage with James R. Weath
erly because he 'has another wife living
at Indianapolis from whom he has
never been divorced.
Divorces were gTanted yesterday by
Judge Seawell to Rose- I. Olrvell from
William C. Olwell, neglect; by Judge
Kerrigan to Josephine M. Rodgers from

Santry, Teddy Murphy and Smilipg
Metzner. The boys were shown
through the prison. -Smiling Metzner

Dan Â¦'Â¦Patch Lowers His Old Record.
OKLAHOMA CITY, O. T., Nov. 17.
In a sensational finish on the associa
tion track here to-day Dan Patch low
ered the world's record for pacing a
mile on a half-mile track, the official
time being 2:03 flat. The previous rec
ord, also held bv Dan Patch, was
made at Birmingham, Ala., last year,
being 2:03U.'
The San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company has sued for an injunction
to prevent the Mutual Electric and
Lighting Company from making %n
excavation on the south side of Mar
ket street, 100 feet w'est from Fourth.
The proposed excavation is to be sev
en by eight feet and six feet deep and
surrounded by a brick wall eight
inches thick. It Is contended that the
plaintiff company's three conduits at
that point will be inclosed by the wall
and the wires will be inaccessible.
This, it is said, would work an injury
to the lighting service and make the
company liable to the municipality.

RUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS. -
FRESNO, Nov. 17. â Calamity
reigned to-day in the Tacoma team.
Eleven to nothing was the score and
the game was even Avorse than this
indicates. In the first inning Ander
son, a Fresno boy. caught. His thumb
was broken by Fitzgerald. Then Over
all caught. He did well, showing a
terrific whip to second. In the sixth
Fitzgerald argued about one of Per
rine's decisions and was run off the
field by the umpire. Keefe went in
without warming up, two men being
on bases. His wildness was remark
able. He filled the bases and forced
three runs In by Â¦ bad throws and
walks. In the seventh Russ Hall and
Mohler made home runs apiece. Gra
ham is expected back to-morrow from
Sacramento and the team hopes to
pull Itself together again. Score:

When the two were in the midst of one
of their warmest mlxups Mr. Johnson
suddenly went to his knees, a la Joe
Gans. The Denverite came rushing at
him. landing foul after foul on the head
and body. It was not a difficult task for
Corbett to miss Jack, for the latter on
his knees was just about the same
height as the former featherweight
champion.
This little side play made quite a hit
with those present,- as it > was -fully as
realistic as the one recently enacted in
Mechanics' Pavilion. Everybody was
on when the big fellow" went ; to his
haunches, but up to that, time the
crowd did not know just what was
coming off. . Corbett had "a- lot of fun
pushing and hugging Johnson .around
the ring and he worked up a good per
spiration while engaged in mauling the
big fellow. The rest of his boxing was
done with Billy Otts and a few hangers
on who were aching for a' chance to
take on little Willie even for fun. .
Corbett weighs 137%' pounds and still
Indulges in plenty of liquids and foods
that put on weight. He is not worry
ing about making. 130 pounds. He is
strong and anxious to work and his
handlers say he Is doing more to con
dition himself for this fight than for
any 'other in which he ever engaged.
He was rather tired after coming off
the road in the morning, for he trav
eled'several miles farther than usual.
It is said on good authority the men
have even been signed up and have
agreed upon the terms under which
the battle will be fought. These de
tails will not be given out to the pub
lic for some little time to come, but it
is safe to assume Jeffries is getting: all
the best of the. entire lay out, as he
knows he is the drawing card.
Just what prompted Jeff to cast
aside his prejudice and take on John
son is not known, but it is more than
likely the champion of all .champions
sees a little coin will come in handv.
After looking carefully over the field
Jeff probably discovered that all the
available talent has either been ex
hausted or has sought cover, so he at
last decided _to pick up a few thousand
by engaging' Mr.- Johnson in combat.
The utmost secrecy has been observed
by those who are engineering the
match. E There is plenty of time in the
future to talk of the affair. The bout
will be fought In Mechanics' Pavilion
and will be a twenty-round affair.
Johnson played a leading role at the
training camp of Young Corbett yester
day afternoon. The figure of the her
culean scrapper loomed up conspicu
ously in the gym and he was voted the
whole show by the assembled guests.
When he boxed with Corbett the pair
presented a sight that was a study in
human makeups. Â¦ . :
Cortain prizefight promoters in this
village have been working their brains
to a standstill nlgTit and day trying to
frame up a plan whereby they might
entrap ' JefC into a match with the big
negro. The champion has been fickle.
He would listen to nothing of the sort.
But tireless work always brings its re
ward. Jeff has at last been reached
and he now lifts up the barrier which
has for so long held Johnson at a dis
tanceâthe color line. Â¦ - '
Many a wise man will be sliehtlv
startled when he learns that Jack John
son, the king of dark skinned fist ar
tists, will be given a chance to en
gage Champion James Jeffries in the
twenty-four foot ring next March. Even
if it does seem a. trifle stranee it is
true, for the big men have already been
matched to fight under the auspices of
the Shasta Club.

Colonel Van was crowded some the last part. Fountain is only a novice, too. Torpedo
sulked.
Billy Cahill began the season well,
Bab earning brackets the first time
out. The mare was played down in the'
.speculating on the mile selling num
ber from 2 J /2 to 1 to 7 to fÂ» favoritism.
She had Davis In the saddle and made
fl promenade' of it, leading Isabellita
first to the -wire a couple of lengths.
Penza nee, at 30 to 1, ran third.
A few of the early risers obtained
6 to 5 about Garnet Ferguson's colt,
The Mighty, but 'it was necessary to
show speed. The stable sent Jn a com
mission on Ocyrohe and W. R. ConÂ»
don was reported a flyer, but neither
made jrood. Davis also piloted The
Mighty and had the race in hand from
start to finish. Sol.LIchtenstein downed
Condon for the place.
With Dominlck replacing W. Daly,
Elliott was a different horse. He ruled
an odds-on choke for the concluding
mile and one hundred yard selling
event and reached port under closely
reefed sails. -Watson, on Ink. moved
along from the far rear, nosing out
Anvil for place honors. Colonel Van
and Flying Tcrpedo were the only
other starters.
TRACK NOTES.
Jack Dwyer, the Chicago bookmak
er, arrived yesterday and will cut in
to-morrow.
Willie Haack, the jockey, was dis
covered signaling results to parties on
the outside yesterday. His badge was
taken up and he was escorted to the
gate.
There was a delay in the paddock
when the horses' were called to the
post for the second race. Tuck Back
tried to transform the paddock into
a match factory and it required the
united efforts of six grooms before he
would submit to being saddled.
Lloyd Fountain, who rode Isabel
lita, lodged a claim of foul against W.
Davis, the rider of Bab. Fountain en
deavored^ to get through on the rail
turning into the stretch for home and
Davis saw no reason, for letting him
through. The claim was not allowed
by the judges.
Billy Randall, the Montana turf
man, who recently lost two of his
string CHvoso and Axminster, in a
wreck, helped swell the paddock
crowd yesterday. '
.With two. winning mounts to his
credit in a day, W. Davis is- well start
ed on the road to success.-.
Bronze Wing is a long way. from be
ing the horse' he was before an attack
of catarrhal fever, placed him on the
shelf. The sprinter now suffers from
rheumatism In the shoulders.
1 ' Stake books of the. New Orleans
Jockey Club have been issued. The
$10,000 Panama handicap is the rich
est event offered. Stake entries close
on the 26th inst, with H. D. Brown
manager and racing secretary/- ;
At the weights Bob Smith's Del
Carina looked like something ripe and
mellow to land the third, but reports
of her condition were hot encouraging.
A steady play on Head Dance sent the
Torsocolt to the post favorite. Helge
sen had the mount on the latter and
succeeded In gotting off in the lead" to
a pretty start. In the run home the
first choice besan to fade, losing the
lead to Dob Ragon, a stanchly sup
ported one. When it looked as if the
last named colt might win. 1 Sammy
Greenfield came strongly on the out
side with Del Carina, scoring cleverly.
DAVIS- SCORES WITH BAB.
A 100 to 1 shot on Tuesday, Cloche
d'Or opened up an 8 to 5 favorite for
the Futurity course selling affair,
which followed. So brisk, however,
was the demand for Bronze Wing tick
ets that the price about the former
mare lengthened to tHrees. Both
Bronze Wing and Albemarle had speed,
but when Fitzpatrick on Cloche d'Or
got ready to play ball It was simply a
matter of closing the blinds, the Coffey
entry breezing in first. Albemarle lost
the place to Bronze Wing in a hard
drive.
CLOCHE DOR WINS AGAIN.
It looked as If only an accident could
prevent Sea Voyage from winning the
opening sprint for fillies. The Miller
filiy revels in heavy going and the ring
took no liberties with her, laying 1 to
2. Piloted by "Big Bill" Knapp she
assumed the front petition early, win
ning at leisure. W. Davis on Babow,
a 25 to 1 outsider, led Mizpah, another
despised one, out for place honors.
The attendance across the bay was
good and as four favorites and two
second choices were successful it is
needless to say the ring suffered heav
ily. A heavy track called for condi
tion and hc-rses not ready made a sorry
showing.
It may be well for race-goers to keep
an eye on Jockey W. Davis, for the
Eastern rider brokethe ice at Oakland
track yesterday, placing two winners
over the line. It always takes a day
oj so to learn the angles of a game
and v become acclimated besides, and
while the Jennings' stable pilot has
been knocking at the door on several
occasio-ns, it was not until . he was
given the. leg up on Bab that he got
fitted to a set of brackets.

The Seals made runs enough in the
first two spasms yesterday at Recrea
tion Park to put them through safely.
The Brownies were there with a come
back In the second round only. It was
then that they showed signs of handing
Mr. Wheeler the wallop, but after that
round, they never figured, though they
loomed up dangerously at intervals.
Score: San Francisco 4, Portland 3.
It was another rapid fire exhibition,
only an hour and twenty minutes be
ing taken up with the struggle. Both
pitchers got some bad bumps in the va
rious Innings, but nearly all the drives
were steered safely into the mitts of
I some waiting outfielder. In this way
tfoth slabsters managed to weather the
storm that was constantly brewing.
Danny Shay became just a trifle too
jocular with the serious Mr. Christie
and had to take a leave of absence in
the fourth round. It was a close play
at the initial bag and Danny was called
out. He called the umpire something
and was then called out again. This
time the Eighth street cop helped him,
while the fans cheered Christie for his
display of nerve.
The first round produced a run for
the Seals. Hildebrand got a walk and
Spencer Juggled Meany's grounder and
then threw the ball into the bleechers,
leaving men on second and third. Ir
win had a long fly, letting Hilde In.
During round three the Seals began to
wield the timber briskly. Anderson hit,
Gochnauer sacrificed and Gorton
plucked a good one, stealing on the first j
ball pitched. Wheeler bunted Andy
home and Hilde got a safe one over
second, chasing Gorton In. j
The Brownies made their stand in the
second inning; after two had been
stowed away. Spencer swung through
to left for a double and Nadeau scored
him by driving safely to the same spot.
He moved as far as third on Hilde
brand's erratic toss to the pan and reg
istered when Frary unloaded allot one
back of short.
After the second. Wheeler had each
Brownie working for him. Not another
man hit safely till the ninth when Run
kle pushed one out to right field. The
fielding on both sides was fast, all the
outfielders having chances to perform.
The score: .

On the athletic grounds the Fourth
Cavalry will go through mounted exer
cises and will show what the term
rough riding means. Besides ordinary
feats of horsemanship picked riders
Â¦will do some hair-raising equestrian
stunts.
A mounted relay race Is also on the
Mil between troops F and G, Fourth
Cavalry- In the afternoon the Pre-
Fidio team will see what they can do
to the Thirteenth Infantry In baseball.
The results of yesterday's competition
In detail follow:
Following are yesterday's results by
teams: Fifteenth Infantry, 15 points;
Presidio. 9 points; Tenth Infantry, 1
point; Fourth Cavalry, 3 points; Thir
teenth Infantry, 6 points, and the Coast
Artillery. 4 points.
The baseball game in the afternoon
between the Tenth Infantry team and
the Presidio was duck soup for the for
mer. Gilespie, the TenrVs handy man,
buffaloed the Presidios with his twirl-
Ing. Score, 5 to 0. .'
The events scheduled for to-day will
be well worth seeing. At 9 a. m. there
will be an exhibition by light batteries
at the terminus of the Union street car
line. â¢ Wheeling into position, limbering,
Â¦unlimbering and all the snappy evolu
tions of that exciting branch of the
service will be shown.
Some of the sprints were full of pal
pitations. In the first heat of the 220
yard dash Corporal Welsh and Private
Holahan sped down the Btretch neck
end neck and breasted the tape at the
came Instant. The time. 27 seconds,
Â¦was good on the sloppy track. The first
heat of the 120-yard high hurdles also
ended in a dead heat. Privates Willett
Â«nd Warmoth cleared the last obstacle
In the same stride and crossed the line
together.
The hardest race was the half-mile.
A lithe, wiry artilleryman set the pace
and a hot one it was. -Private Haynes
of the Fifteenth Infantry hung just be
hind the bunch" till they rounded the
turn on the last lap. Then he cut loose
and greased lightening was a crippled
ice wagon compared to him. He passed
everybody and took the race in 2:14.
The finals of the hurdle races, the
220 and the 100 yard dashes will be run
off to-day. The relay race had to be
postponed and will also be one of the
events to-day.
The opening: of the athletic contests
given by the Department of California.
U. 6. A., drew large crawds yesterday
to the athletic grounds at the Presidio.
Had the track been a good one and the
' field level some records might have
: been made that would open the eyes of
the college athlete.
The grounds are on a Bide hill and
the track is moist clay that clutches
'the feet of thÂ» runner and wears him
out. Even with these disadvantages
; the showing made will look good any
where. Though the half mile was run
!part of the distance on an up grade the
time was 2:14.
The Fifteenth Infantry carried off the
honors of the day, their trackmen
scoring fifteen points In the track and
field events and easily capturing the
baseball game from the Presidio team.
Nearly the entire population of the
poet gathered about the athletic
grounds. Soldiers forgot all about drill
calls, fatigue calls and even the allur
ing mess calls did not move them till
the last race was over.

The steamship George W. Elder was:
inspected yesterday by Rear Admiral Â¦
Kempff and Captains Guthrle andDolan, j
assistant United States local inspectors, i
Some of the cork life preservers were I
found to be unable to sustain the pro- i
scribed weight of 27^ pounds In the j
water and were accordingly con- j
demned. 'Two Ifeboats were found !
to need some Â¦ repairs and the re- j
pairs were ordered. Three metal life ;
rafts- were pronounced defective and
were condemned. In all other respects j
the inspectors reported the vessel in
first-class condition. The old floating ,
test for life preservers was twenty-four
pounds, but a recent .regulation since '
the ship was last Inspected requires a.
test of 27Â»a pounds. i
Some Deficient Ufe Preservers and
Three Metal RaTts Found on Board

VIENNA, Nov. 17.â After more than
six months' recess the Austrian Par
liament resumed its sittings to-day.
After the Introduction of the budget
Premier von Koerber rose amid a hos
tile demonstration from the German
parties. His remarks regarding â¢ the
Innsbruck Incident were frequently in
terrupted by noisy and violent cries
from the Germans, who appeared to be
greatly, dissatisfied with Dr. von Koer
ber's explanation.
The Premier asked the House to sup
port the Government bill for. the es
tablishment of an Italian law faculty
at Itovereto 'in order to permit the clos
ing of the provisional law faculty at
Innsbruck as soon as possible. The
Germans thereupon shouted:
"The Tyrolean veterans will take care,
of that"
The Premier announced that the Gov
ernment accepted all the responsibility
for the Innsbruck affair and said the
guilty. parties would be punished.
It is considered that the Rovereto
bill will, in any degree, settle the Ital
ian University question,, the Italians
having absolutely declined to accept
the Government's offer to establish a
faculty at Rovereto. i
Having announced a large number of
new bills dealing with a variety of in
ternal reforms. Premier von Koerber
emphasized the urgency of the country
devoting Itself to commercial and po
litico economic developments, emulat
ing Germany and other nations. Even
Russia, with a great war on her hands,
hp said, is busily insuring her economic
future by the conclusion of commercial
treaties.
An excited discussion followed, Dr.
Erelor accusing the Premier of treating
him brutally In their Interview follow
ing the Innsbruck trouble. â¢ Dr. Erelor
declared that the Premier had not ut
tered a word of . dlsapprovel of the ac
tion of the Italian students. The House,
he said, should co-operate to expel the
Government. . .
Premier von Koerber, in reply- to
criticisms, maintained <hat both par
ties must share the responsibility of
the deplorable Innsbruck excesses,
which never would have occurred, but
for mischievous agitation. In closing
the Premier asked:
"Who is to blame?". -
There were angry shouts of "You,
Von Koerber," and amid great confu
sion the debate was adjourned.

DISAPPROVES OP STRIKES.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 17.â Aged 80
years, a wealthy farmer of Lincoln
County and about to become the happy
husband of an 18-year-old girl, J. R.
mourned the loss of a hat for
some time this morning. It was not so
much the hat itself as the manner in
which he lost it. that caused Lufsky
sorrow. He had his hair cut, his whis
kers trimmed and his eyebrows "doc
tored" at the Hotel Perkins barber shop
and upon refusing to pay the bill pre
sented his tile was annexed as security.
Lufsky came to Portland to "buy
things for the weddmg." Though his
years are many his heart is young and
he desired to make the best appear
ance possible, so he hied himself to the
establishment of the dispensers of
shaves. There he plared himself under
the care of a "tonsorial artist" and
"went the route."
There was a considerable amount of
whiskers to remove. The hair had for
, some time accumulated and the barber
: figured the total costs at $3 50. The
groom-elect considered the charges be
yond reason and refused to pay.
Now, among the various things with
which Lufsky had bedecked himself in
preparation for his coming transposi
tion into benedicthood was a certain
handsome and costly hat. The head
gear wap left hanging on the rack in
the barber shop while the barber was
at work and when the dispute as re
gards th,e price arose the manager of
the shop annexed the hat, to be held
in lieu of cash. The sum of SI 50 was
tendered, but the barber refused to
compromise, and the aged groom
sallied forth in search of a policeman,
a large crowd leathering to cheer him
on his way. Things were finally
amicably arranged â all being satisfied
if not happy.
CHICAGO, Nov. 17.â If the determin
ation of the leaders in the of
the furniture teamsters is carried out
one of the bitterest fights that has taken
place In recent years in the local labor
world is predicted. To-day twenty
three teamsters went out, 120 more
have been called out for to-morrow
and other teamsters may be summoned
to a sympathetic strike.
The strike opened to-day with rioting
and fighting in the streets and more
trouble is predicted, as the furniture
dealers say that they will continue to
make deliveries with non-union drivers
and it is expected that wagons will be
attacked as soon as they appear in the
streets, even though guarded by police.
Secretary A. J. Reed of the Team
sters' Joint Union said to-night:
All the teamsters who are now out and who
will be called out to-morrow arÂ© teanaaters
working for members of the Chicago Employ
ers' Association; but, unless we obtain our de
mands, /which we believe are Just, the strike
will be carried beyond members of the Chi
cago Employers' Association and Is likely to
take in many labor organizations. ,
Frederick Job, wKo is manager of
the Chicago Employers' Association,
said to-night:
It looks as if this strike would spread, and
we will light it to a finish.
The point at issue with the furniture
drivers is the refusal on the employers'
part to sign contracts with them. No
question of wages is involved.

steady tone the wheat market was gradually
eaaed off until sentiment had become decidedly
we_k. At the start the market was Influenced
by hither cables. December dropped a shade
to HO^ic higher at $1 12tt to $1 12*. and
May a shade lower to %c higher at f 1 12% to
$1 12%. The i-lllcg was reneral from tht
â¢tart. With a diminished demand, price un
interruptedly dedln-d. Weakness In North
western markets was one of the main reasons
for the depression here. A message from
MlnneapoUs reported that cash ealea were
comrwhat slow. It - was claimed that mills
there were still buying No. S* Northern and
No. 4 Northern, but nx In *uch large quantl
tl-s as rester-ar. Continuing favorable weath
er for tne movement cf grains from the farms
was another Influence affectlnx pit traders.
Throughout the cession smal! holders were per
Â¦Uteoi Â¦ellera. Within the last few mlautea of
tra&injr December uU to tl 10%, while May
dadlnrd to $1 10%91 11. Sentiment was ex

WHEAT â Chicago waa l%c lower. This
market, on the contrary, was l@lVÂ«c higher
for futures In the morning on prospects of
some movement to the Bast under the reduced
rail rate which recently became effective.
There is some figuring on shipping Wheat
from the Sound to New York, around the Horn
owing: to the scarcity of car*, which is de
laying the delivery of tnÂ« 12.000,000 or 15,
000, COW bushels purchased up there some time
ago for the Middle West. It is calculated
that by shipping by water much Wheat can
actually be landed In the East before- all the
delayed rail orders are filled.
The cash grain was steady and unchanged.
Futures were weaker In the afternoon.

cused by the Pommer-Eilers Music Co.

William R. Wheeland, brother of
the late Samuel "Wheeland and one of
his heirs, has filed an opposition to the
application of the administratrix for
permission to sell the stock of the
Wheeland Brick Company at 50 cents
a share. He declares that the stock
is worth 51, will soon be paying divi
dends and that the company is on a
profit making basis. He says a new
drier has been installed that will give
the plant a capacity of 10,000,000
bricks a year and that & contract has
been made for 4,000,000 bricks for the
new library at Stanford University,
upon which the profit will be $1 50
per thousand. Wheeland declares
that there is nothing to fear from, the
"brick trust," because, as he says,
Gray . Bros, have the contract for
building the Southern Pacific tunnel,
which will take all the ! bricks pro

Attorney Newburgh, in a brief filed at

violent attack upon the honesty and
professional conduct of District Attor
ney Byington. It Is alleged that the ac
cused official committed a criminal act
in mutilating a court record. Byington
is not alarmed over the charges.
The trouble arose in the course of pro
ceedings In the case of William Noon,
for whom Newburgh is acting as coun
sel. The defendant was convicted of
burglarizing a house at 503 Mason
street and received a sentence of twen
ty years at San Quentln. An appeal
was taken to the Supreme Court. It is
alleged that Byington cut a page from
the transcript to conceal an error made
by one of his assistants.

POLICE COURT LAWYER
MAKES SERIOUS CHARGE
When a man catches up with his
own ideals he has begun to die.
Following close upon the heels of
the resignation of William H. High as
a member of the State Bank Commis
sion comes the announcement from Re
publican headquarters that Guy B. Bar
ham of Los Angeles, also a member of
the commission, will soon dace his
resignation in the hands of "Governor
Pardee, the same to take effect on
January 1.
The announcement that Barham has
decided to retire from office occasioned
some surprise among his friends, but,
like his associate on the board, Mr.
High, he desires to give his entire at
tention to his private business, feeling
that in the battle of the years before
him he will profit more by taking the
step, he contemplates at the opening of
the new year. . :
The demands upon his time as a
member of the Bank Commission, Mr.
Barham told his friends, were so great
that his private interests were being
neglected by him through necessity.
Appreciating the fact that as a public
official the public had. the first de
mand upon his time he permitted mat
ters that required his urgent attention
to wait upon what leisure time pre
sented itself to him In his official ca
pacity. When this leisure time came
he often found that he had sacrificed
his own â¢ interests. Then, philosophiz
ing with himself, he came to the con
clusion that he must either abandon all
of his private business or resign from
office. He decided upon the latter course,
so on the first of the year Governor
Pardee must appoint his successor.
Mr. Barham was appointed Bank
Commissioner In the latter part of 1902,
but during the following session of the
Legislature a bill was passed and
signed by the Governor abolishing the
commission. Barham thus found him
self legislated out of office, but in June
of 1903, after the new banking law, re
organizing the commission, had gone
into effect, he was reappointed and has
held the office up to this time. After
retirement from office he will return to
Los Angeles and devote his entire at
tention to important business under
takings. . .
The salary that attaches to the office
is $3600 a year and with two of these of
fices on his hands and the appointment
of the entire appellate bench, nine
Judges, to be looked after, Governor
Pardee will have ammunition with
which to please eleven of his friends
and, perhaps, displease many more that
fail to be numbered among the winners.
-This gave Campbell the clew and he
collected evidence that convinced him
that J. E. King and Tony Bianci, who
handle these passes for the Grand
Opera-house, the Columbia and Fisch
er's, had been making money by selling
passes.
An employe of the California Theater
was discharged for the same cause.
The three have been acting with keep
ers of small stores, to whom they gave
part of the money received. King and
Bianci did- not appear at the Grand
Opera-house last night. They will be
discharged.
The managers of local theaters have
decided to discontinue giving passes to
small stores for displaying ads, as it
has been discovered that the practice
has permitted grafters to beat the
showhouses out of about $20,000 a year.
This discovery was made by Harry
Campbell, the wide-awake treasurer of
the Grand Opera-house.
A few days ago a woman appeared
with six passes such as are given for
displaying lithographs. Campbell be
came suspicious and told the woman
that they were no good. "Why, they
ought to be," said the woman. "I paid
75 cents for them."
In the afternoon the prisoner waa
taken before United States Commis
sioner Heacock and the complaint
was read to him after he had
been properly identified by United
States Secret Service Agent George W.
Hazen. Judge Heacock set November
23 at 2 p. m. as the time for the pre
liminary examination. Bail was fixed
at $5000, in default of which Cary was
remanded to the custody of the United
States Marshal. The case for the Gov
ernment Is being handled by Charles
M. Fickert, Assistant United States
District Attorney.
Had I teen a poor man. tempted by priva
tion, he could probably find some excuse for
me, but In my case it is just the other way. I
am all the more culpable because I was not In
such a condition. But I had no. criminal In
tent. I am not a professional criminal.. I
might have wronged thousands of people by
some fraudulent scheme with less risk of de
tection and punishment had I been really
criminal, at heart. But I must make up my
mind to bear patiently with all the conse
quences of my acts.
"The newspapers have told all that
there is to be stated," he said yester
day as he sat in Chief Hazen's office.
"I don't know that I can add anything
to what has been published. I don't
know how I got into this thing. It was
wrong, certainly, but what I did was
not as a criminal â not with criminal
intent. I M-as not a gambler and I
didn't drink to excess. I was earning
5100 per month at my profession. The
$3 per diem that I averaged by drill
ing the coins certainly should not have
been any inducement to commit the
crime, for it must be remembered that
I could easily have 'made five or six
times that sum and by the aid of con
federates have . flooded the country
with drilled double eagles. I knew all
along that it was only a matter of
time when I would be caught."
Mr. Cary was smoothly shaved, well
groomed and stylishly dressed. His
manner was calm and at a casual
glance, unconcerned. He said:
Thfere is a peculiar psychological
mystery about the case of James H.
Cary, the young attorney arrested by
Secret Service Agents Hazen and.Fos
ter last Wednesday for drilling double
eagles and extracting gold therefrom.
According t& his own story, he seldom
drank to excess, did not gamble, and
was earning $100 per month in the prac
tice of his profession. If this is true it
was not the pinch of poverty that drov e
him to the crime. Neither was it the
greed of gain, for he satisfied himself
with an average of $3 per day from
his unlawful tampering with coins,
when without very hard labor he
could have realized at least $15 per
day without increasing the chances of
detection. He took a pride in his
work; it was unexcelled in the annals
of counterfeiting. Probably, when the
scheme suggested itself to himâ for he
says it was his original conceptionâ it
fascinated .him to such an extent as
to destroy all his flrier moral sensibili
ties. From the moment he was taken
into custody he never attempted to
deny or excuse his crime. Although he
knew that detection was inevitable, he
followed the fascinating pursuit for
three years. In all that period, while,
the Government officers were studying
his tracks trying to make out an un
assailable case against him, he took
but pna vacation from the work and
that was last summer, when he went
to the hop fields for two months, leav
ing his tools behind him. When he re
turned to his room, which was both
workshop and laboratory for him, the
old fascination twined its tendrils
about his soul and held him prisoner
for evil.

out with an Itching rash. Three doc-
tors prescribed for him, but he kept
getting worse until we could not dress
him any more. â¢ They finally fcdrised
me to try a certain medical college, bnt
Its treatment did not do any {rood. At
the time I waa- induced to try Cuticura
Remedies he was so bad that I had to
cut his hair off and 'put the Cuticura
Ointment on him on bandages, as it was
impossible to touch him with the bare
hand. There was not one square inch
of skin on his whole body that was not
affected. He waa one mass of sores.
The bandages used to stick to his skin
and in removing them it used to take
the skin off with them, and the screams
from the poor child were heart-break-
ing. I began to think, that he would
never get well, bat after the second
application of Cuticura Ointment I
began to see signs of Improvement,
and with the third and fourth applica-
tions the sores commenced to dry up.
His skin peeled off twenty times, but it
finally yielded to the treatment. I used
the Cuticura Resolvent for his blood,
and now I can say that he is entirely
cured, and a stronger and healthier boy
you never saw than he is to-day."

No return in six years, Mr. Wattam
writes, Feb. 23, 1903.
"Your letter of the 21st in regard to
the case of my little boy at hand. I am
truly thankful to say that the cure
effected by the Cuticura Remedies has
been a most thorough and successful
cure to date."
