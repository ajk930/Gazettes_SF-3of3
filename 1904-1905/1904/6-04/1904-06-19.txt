1 Uie new novel of Jewish
life in liussia and America,
by Ezra S. Brudiio, which
has created such a stir, both
in Europe and America, in
which, perhaps for the first
time, shows the real condi

CHAPTER XI. V
â¢THE MYSTERY REVEALED.
'.Outside it was -dark, cold; dreary,
.wltn^a bitter wind-driven sleet.- A dog
growled in his kennel as I passed him,
.but; after springing out i he seemed to
recognize me and quietly disappeared .
.within his shelter. I found; the gate
jt fastened^ so I- had .to: climb- over the .
I high barbed-wire fence which inclosed -
V the ; yard, { to the; great â¢ injury. of " my â¢
clothes.-. On reaching- iqe roaa^i km
undecided . which direction-, to take.
Darkness was all about .me;; a fearful
sadness possessed me;, and. as, I ad
vanced a few steps an enigmatic, pow^r
was pulling me back. But L struck, out
on. the slushy road east at my fastest
walk. Gusta.of. sleet lashed -my face,
and my feet sank to; tlie^ankles a, t
every step. I tram.ped;Qn-,and .onâ
whither? My head was crammed wltji
fragmentary thoughts^-of my^erstwhUe
happiness, of my folly, oj , my
tudeâ and my heart. sank wtth\sh,amÂ©
of .myself. Instantly, however.^reason
came to my defense:, I had
noysln; T had^done, harm^to no one; ,1
Ibved'JCatla as a slstex, and .why should
Inpt^kisa her? r What harm Â¦ is .there in
a Jcjjre.. that . because .of Â¦ one the'ssudya
should., notify me to' leave? I thought of
the\>money I 'had ; taken;<lt. seemed to
burn {in my. pocket. ' ,1 pulled '.out.- the
notes ..and- flung themjflercely .into 1 the
.mud,* and -plodded on my way- with a
quieter -mind.
I tramped on through a seemingly
endless j stretch of mud-and-slush-cov
ered. land till at length I reached
small -village,* one of. those entirely
occupied by muzhiks (peasants), with
barnllke houses and houselike barns. I
would have sought shelter in one of the
hedged-ln huta, but all the dogs of this
little community set-up such a loud
barking that I was glad to get out vt
the village with my life. After another
half hour of the heavy road I caught
the faint lights of another village. By
this time. I was numb to my very bones
from the damp cold, my legs were so
fagged that one would hardly follow
the other, and my face stung as if It
had been lashed with a bunch of net
tles. -But I struggled desperately,
blindly on till I reached the village,

CHAPTER XL 'Ji-l'j,
I BID FAREWELL TO ZAMOK.
Y IMMEDIATELY repaired to my
I room and locked myself in. ,My
I present happiness was gone, and the
magnificent castles I had built in
the air were*; all shattered. The
dreary weather outside added gloom to
ray misery. The . rain was ' now
completely changed to large flakes
of snow that disappeared as . they
fell upon the muddy ground. Â¦ The
eudya's stern countenance stood before
my mind's eye; his harsh voice was
still ringing In my ears. , I brooded and
reflected, though ' nothing /'definite
shaped Itself in my mind. I thought of
Katla, of how the eudya glanced at her
â¢ as she walked across' the room and past
hrm- with downcast eyes; and I shiv
ered. ; I had made'her suffer .on my ac
count. .This. .thought lacerated, my".
heart .arrd-I writhed with BhameT ; /vf ;
Â¦ I sat brooding till It grew dark, but
could not shape any definite plan..** A
knock interrupted my sad deliberation.
I opened the door, and'^Catla's'.gover
ness entered' -rtRh *a little parcel Iri^'her
? hand and placed" it r on the table before
me."
"The'Budya sends this to you," she
j said briefly; ..a.nd bidding me a cold
"good evening" left the room.
Â¦I regarded 'the parcel for several
minutes } before I 4 could ' summon ' the
* courage to olien' It; * I" knew ; absolutely
v what message .; it * brought , to me. ' 'I
; opened, it . with . trembling hands, and

paces back over, the road that led to
Zamok I realized how useless such a
step would be, >; With these .thoughts
still torturing my brain I returned!' arid
as If fearing ray own will I . began to
run. Â¦ . .V . -Â¦Â¦.â¢"',-â¢.-.Â¦'
The 'weather had slightly^ changed
during the night; the hail- and' snow
had ceased falling, and the , warm
caress of the rising sun turned the fur
rowed fields into splashy mud and
slush. At every step I could scarcely
free my foot from the slimy mud, and
my boots squashed like croakltfg frogs.
\ I struggled along the mail'rbad, mel
ancholy, my head bent overmj^chest.
Gradually my fierce sentiment. -against
Bialnick gave place to a different, feel
ing, and my heart began to throb?vio
lently. i At first this feeling was vague,
almost incomprehensible, but ; I was
soon conscious of a sweet and alluring
air chiming in my ears; a soothing
sensation passed through my frame; a
charming picture presented itself be
fore meâ Katia! I / felt the thrill of
hope as this vision fllttsa through my
mind. Again my heart was burning
with a> craving desire: again my blood
was flowing warmer and swifter; again
an almost Irresistible impulse was forc
ing me back to Zamokâ go back and
read of the same book with her; feel
the I touch of her locks against my
burning? cheeks ; hear her - gay \ again,
"Why, you foolish Israel, '"' then III
marry you"â and forgetâ forget my
father and her father and everything
that embittered my heart!
But I realized that to return was lm-
passengers had supper at the inn be
fore which the klbltka 'hacs dropped us,
but I, having no money, set c-utvimme-
Vl|at6ly for the yeshlva^ Though night
had fallen, I needed no guide to It;
brightly, lighted; It towered above the
few hundred low-built, thatch-roofed
huts that composed -Javolln. From a
distance It appeared like a lighthouse,
and its reflection cast a vast shadow
over, the sea of roofs* '-I 'followed this
light. The town was quiet; not a mov
ing team, not a pedestrian, not an
other light to chear the deserted alleys,
not even. the sound of my footsteps as
I was treading the slushâ nothing but
dense darkness, gloom, isolation. -'Only
once this deathlike stillness was broken
as the door of a tavern opened. Â¦'
. But hark! While still at* some dis
tance^ from the yeshiva; a 'sound like
that* of water seething:. over a great
dafc reached my ears. I held my
breath; 1 put my feet down softly; I
strained ray ears. As I; approached
nearer the seminary the sound grew
louder and separated into distinct
voicesâ the sum of hundreds of voices,
each pitched In Its own key. For a
minute .1 stood In front of the great
white building and gazed through the
lc-ng arched windows at the swaying
heads and shadows . of heads, of
shoulders, of opening and closing
mouths, and at "the waving arms,
slightly oscillating- lamps suspended, on
long wires; and I watched; the young
students.- with 1 cigarettes 'between their
lips and long books under their arms,
hurry 'down the score' of' cut' atone
steps and disappear in the many small
side â¢streets i > that* branch - off the yes
hlva campus. '. , -
I climbed the stairs with awe in my
heart, opened the door, and trembling
ly-entered. A' ''bewildering/ spectacle
This sarcasm cut me to the quick.
He saw the effect of his words and
hastened to make amends.. "1 mean
no harm," he said, scratching the
same pell. "Go to the rosh-h'shiva
(principal), and he win <jo the right
thing by. you." . Â¦ - i
;The. rosh-h'shiva lived in a luxurious
home next to the seminary. ,1 ascended
the high porch and. was -admitted to a
brightly ' lighted * corridor.
A tall, handsome young lady, richly
dressed, with the dignity of a queen
and the arrogance â¢ of : a ; servant-girl
others in ciuines of the very latest
style; not a few appeared wealthy,
their faces' wearing the expression of
the spoiled child. Hale, robust lads
with \ broad shoulders and piercing
eyes were promiscuously discernible
among flat-breasted, submissive-look
ing boys.
A short, heavy-set man with a small,
Iron-gray beard and dull face walked
between the rows of desks, scrutiniz
ing everybody with his stupid eyes and
noting in his little book every vacant
seat. He was the mashslach (Inspect
or). He frequently stopped and spoke
to those seated near, as If inquiring
about the absent student. A tall man
with sottish eyes, purple nose and
curly pells (ear-locks) roiiowed behind
the mashgiach, step by step.
A few students noticed me standing
near the door, but no attention was
paid me until the man with the sottish
eyesâ who. I, was told later, was the
mashgiach's â¢ assistant â came . to me
and, asked whom I wished. to see.: I
told him ' I came to enroU in the yes
hiva. He glanced me oyÂ«r with a sa
tirical smile on his facer and scratch
ing his left ptli said: "Did you bring
your wet-nurse and your cradle along

turned the driver. "I agreed with you

"For how much?" he askeci pointedly,
beating the. butt of his whip against
his long, muddy boots. -

My first impulse as I left the hut was
to go back to the sudya and tell him all
I had discoveredâ tell him that I knew
he was the cause of my father's death.
BACK TO MY OWN.
CHAPTER XII.
"Not in his name," struck In the
pious priest. "It was in Satan's
name." And he made the cign of the
cross over his breast
"Yes, batiushka, . in the devil's name/
And while I was in the devil's clutches
I coaxed the child into the woods. I
cut its throat and hid the body in the
synagogue."
He ended and lay fighting for his
says he. I knew her well; she was a
pretty girl; people talked about 1 her
being Blalnlck's mistress. 'I want you
to go to her house quite often,' says he,
'and tell the people she is your mis
tress.' "Yes." says I, and I was set free
the same day."
He rested again and then went on:
"A few months later Marianka gave
birth to a. child. The sledevatel gave
me money for Marianka: when I gave
it to her she took it ana cried. Then
one day Bialnick called me to his office
and asked me to own the bastard as
mine. I did not object What differ
ence was it to me? So everybody said
the child was mine, and I laughed.
Several years passed. I had plenty to
drink and plenty of money. The slede
vatel was never stingy. The brat grew
like a saplingâ the very image of Bial
nick."
For several minutes he- struggled
hard for his breath. The priest was
like a statue. My heart! was throb
bing and my head was whirling.
"A few weeks before Easter Bial
nick sent for me. He asked me how I
liked being called the father of an
other man's, child. 'Would It not be
bett to get rid of this bastard,' says
he â 'better for me, better for you?' I
said It would. v 'Why should one not
make an end of it?' says he. I told him
that would be a risky business. 'We
could transfer it to the Jewish ac
count,' says he. I did not understand.
He said that Passover was near, and
didn't I know that Jews kill Christian
children for the Passover. 'Some Jew
would be blamed for it/ says he. ' 'Why
not Yudel Abramowltch?* I said he was
a good man; he had been very good to
me. 'Michael,' says he, 'you are a fool.
Don't you know the Jews killed our
Savior and nailed him to- the cross, and
they are still sucking our blood? Yudel
Abramowltch is a bloodsucker/ says
he. .'He's skinning the peasants alive,
and he got all his money by his Jew
.tricks and has a mortgage on all my
property/ All the time he had poured
out glass after glass of whiskyâ and
oh. batiushka. I promised!"
Michael fell back on the straw and
tossed convulsively.
"Go onâ go on." the batlushka en
couraged him. "God will forgive you.
You have only been the instrument In
the hands of a wicked man."
. ."Yes, yes, batiushka, only an Instru
ment, blessed batiushka," wept the dy
ing peasant "Our Savior knows that I
did it in his name, as Bialnick told
meâ"
Menke, was a small man who hud
probably ceased to grow at the age of
12, as Is sometimes the case with hard
working, children. His bones were
large and broad, and the more promi

cover them wit* enough flesh; his
cheek bones were high and the cheeks
The same day I obtained lodgings at
a poor tailor's for the modest price of
twenty-five copecks a week, and I
hoped to stretch the balance of my
stipend so that it would cover my
board and other necessaries. .
I do not believe my landlord ever had
a given name, and if he had I am cer
tain he was unacquainted with it. In
the community he was known as Men
ke Shmunke'sâ that is, Menke the son
of Shmunke. And his wife, who
through some blunder >.f Providence
was made a -woman, was commonly
called Groone Menke ShmuDke's. Not
withstanding their humble station and
names, Groone always talked disdain
fully of the "ordinary working classes."
and so Influenced her husband as to
make him believe that he was a. re
spectable baal-hToos (bourgeois). |
He freed himself 'and turned to a
group of loiterers. "See here. # you fel
lows, you'll find It a good plan to leave
him alone." Without waiting for their
reply he led me off to his room, and
there we told one another of our ex
periences. I confided everything to
him except my feeling for Katia. a sub
ject too sacred for me to lay bare even
to my dearest friend. In spite of my
deadly hatred against her father, she
was sweeter than ever to me.
Before I was quite settled I sauntered
diffidently about the yesniva. A num
ber of students, who would sneak out
as soon as the rosh-h'shiva appeared,
were always found. lounging about the
lobby, with books under their arms
and lighted cigarettes between their
lips. For some young, men came here
for the sole purpose of being enrolled
as students in order that they might
obtain a reputation for scholarship and
so have their dowries- increased. They
would chat, crack Jokes, play pranks
upon one another, criticize* the yeshlva
officials, make insinuating remarks
about Rabbi Brill's young wife, and
were altogether bent" on mischief.
-.Seeing me, they began to make me
the butt of their Jests. A- tall, lean'
fellow, with glasses on his nose, whis
pered to another, loud enough to be
heard by them all: "Did this baby
(meaning me) bring his mamma
along?" A roar of . laughter followed
this facetious remark, jjf I blushed,
dropped my eyes, arid bored, my pocket
painfully. Immediately a. j coiled wet
towel, thrown by one of.-tbe group,
struck me In the back of the. neck and
sent my cap flying. I should have. been
furious at this insult, but I had only a
desire to sneak away.
"Shrolke!" exclaimed a" voice aj X
was picking up my cap. .
I wheeled about Joyfully. "Ephralm!"
I cried; and we , weTe straightway
clasped in each other's arms. .
"A mountain never meets a moun
tain, but one person comes across an
other," be quoted in Aramalc-Chaldalc.
The following morning I .presented
myself before the niashglach,'who,was
also the examiner, and upon hfa recom
mendation I was accepted and granted
a stipend of seventy-five copecks p.
week, though Rabbi Brill's beautiful
young wife Insisted that. fSty copecks
were plenty.
MY NEW HOME.
CHAPTER XIV.
The rabbi looked at me thoughtfully,
curling a few hairs of his white beard
about his forefinger. His young -wife
regarded me "with anything but pleas
ure. Â¦ . â¢
"Well," he said after a few moments,
"present yourself before the maahgiach
to-morrow, and If he reports your ex
aminations satisfactory we'll see what
we can do for you." .
% "I don't believe we can give anything
to a resident of Teploffka." struck In
his wife, noticeably irritated, as if her
own money were in question. "I looked
at the books the other day and I found
that Teploffka never contributed much
to the yeshlva."
"Aâ aâ my child" (he addressed his
wife also as "my child), the rabbi said
softly, " we'll see to-morrowâ aâ aâ
we'll see to-morrow."
A'few minutes later, I was tramping
back through the muddy street to the
tavern where the kibltka had dropped
me. â¢â¢. '
He raised his eyes.-,, "What do you
wish, my child?" he asked in a benign,
husky voice.
I told him that I desired to enter his
institution.
' He stretched out his little fat hand.
"Sholam aleichetn (peace be to you)."
he said. "And . where^ dof-you come
from?" Jv '
I knew -the consequence If I told the
truth. I hesitated a moment and then
gave the name of a small town I had
never seen. . Â¦ >. y' Â¦
He was proceeding * to question me
further, showing a* little rigor in his
tone, when he vas interrupted, by ths
young lady I had met in the corridor.
"Miriam, how Is* Teploffka?" he -asked
of her. "Do we get; anything from
there I"
I *The collectors scarcely make their
expenses." she replied authoritatively.
â¢'And besides, we have no trustees
there, and I do not believe that we can
allow a Teploffka student any stipend."
I did not know what reply to . make.
I stood dumb between the agÂ«.dj rabbi
and* the beautiful young lady " (who I
afterward learned was his third wife),
like a Daniel between two lions. ;
The rosh-h'shiva turned again to me:
"Perhaps your father will be able to
send you enough money, so that you
won't need any stipend," he* sug
gested. '
"I have no father." I murmured
"A yosem (orphan)?" he inquired in
a sympathizing tone.
"Neither father nor mother," I re
plied.
"You may see him in his study
there." she said a trifle haughtily, and
pointed to a large room across the hall
way, the. doors of which were open.
I stopped at the threshold. A solidly
built man of about 70 years, with a
calm, broad, square forehead, was
stooped over a long table, upon' which
lay* a number of open folios. His un
spectacled eyes skipped from book to
book as he turned a lew leaves at one
or scribbled a few words on the margin
of another.- Every line uv his face
showed complete ; absorptlo#. I stood
for some minutes waiting""- for. him to
take notice Of me. but he continued
bent over the- books, unconscious of
my presence. So; I thought it wise to
cough. .
who .marries : her. master, cam* up to
me and asked:
"Do you wish to see the rabbi?"
"Yes," I murmured. .
The rest of the family paid no heed
to the dying man. "My confession â my
confession," he murmured feebly, as he
tossed about convulsively in the
agonies of death. Once tie rose by a
sudden impulse to a sitting posture
and screamed: "Oh, the priest! Confes
sion â my confession!" Nobody seemed
to have heard him: the family was
peacefully snoring; a rew pigs under,
the family bed grunted and squealed
restlessly.
It must have been a little before day
break when I heard approaching foot
steps. Soon the door opened, and Ba
sil entered with a corpulent old man,
â¢whose long, white hair overhung his
broad shoulders.
"Here, batlui-hka," Basil said rever
entially, pointing a finger at his
brother, writhing with pain on the
ground.
The batiushka remained standing In
the middle of the room, leaning on his
heavy gold-headed walking-stick. The
host produced a long, thin lath, which
he stuck between two uncemented
bricks of the oven and then lighted.
The flaring torch cast a mournful light
over the whole room, and brought out
the cadaverous face of the dying man
with ghastly distinctness.
"Michael," Basil said to bis brother,
"here is the batiushka."
The dying peasant made an effort to
raise his head, but fell back upon the
truss of straw. There was a convul-
Michael emitted a deep groan. "God
knows whetherâ I'll live long enoughâ
to see the sun. Call the batiushka."
I shuddered. Basil scratched his
head again, muttered a few curses un
der his breath, and put on his heavy
fur coat and his sheepsKln hat. "I
know you will trouble the batiushka
for nothing." he said, and slammed the
door behind him.
Basil scratched his head as If unde
cided what to do. He looked good
natured, . but he appeared to entertain
come doubts as to whether his brother
had reached the point when a priest is
necessary. He uttered a curse good
naturedly, as if his brother's request
Â¦was merely an every-day Jest, and
Â¦aid: "Oh. Michael, you won't die yet.
and I'll trouble the batiushka (little
father) for nothing."
"Basilâ Iâ Â«mâ dying."
â¢To the devil!" my host muttered, as
he Jumped out of bed. "What do you
want, Michael 7"
"Brother"â Michael made a hard ef
fort to epeakâ "brother, bring a priest.
I am dying."
I climbed upon the high oven and
was coing to lie down, when I noticed
something stirring there. And I was
etill more startled to find a partnerâ a
girl. I was going to slip back to the
floor, but ehe said, "There Is plenty of
room here." and Innocently moved
aside. The morality which had been
Inculcated In me did not permit me to
accept her courtesy, and I offered as
an excuse that it was too warm. So I
lay down on one of the benches.
The family soon fell asleep again,
but, exhausted though / 1 was. sleep
would not come to my eyes. My mind
followed a train of feverish thoughts
aroused by the events of the afternoon
and night; and besides, even had my"
mind not been active. I would have
been kepf awake by the deep groans
that aroie near me, which, however,
did not seem to disturb the other occu
pants of the hut. After 'my eyes had
become accustomed to the semi-dark
ness I discovered a man lying upon a
trust of straw on the ground but a few
feet away from me. The dim light be
fore the Image of. Christ cast a yel
lowish glow upon his emaciated coun
tenance. He lay covered with a tat
tered sheepskin coat; his head rested
upon a dirty straw cushion. His eyes
were closed, his mouth half open, and
he was breathing slowly, a groan com
ing forth with every breath.
"Basil!" he cried out, after I had
been in the hut for perhaps a quarter
of an hour.
Nobody answered; loud snoring rang
through the stenchy room. I could now
hear the man on the ground breathing
heavily and tossing about restlessly.
Several minutes passed.
"Basil!" he cried again in a hoarse,
feeble voice. The only answer was a
chorus of snores from the "family
bed."
A suffocating stench pervaded the
room; however, the warmth brought
new life into my benumbed body. Four
or five of the occupants of the bed
raised their heads, and I noticed by the
light of the oil lamp that they were of
both sexes.
The good muzhik set black bread,
salt and water before me, and asked
me whether or not I was hungry. I
thanked, him gratefully, and said all I
cared for was & place to deep.
"There. SJldotchick (little Jew), is a
warm spot." he pointed with his finger
at the top of the oven. And he un
ceremoniously raised the large blanket
and crept under by the side of his
family.

nrrrow alley. I stopped before the first
hut, which stood behind a broad rustic
pate, end from which a glimmering
light shone forth, determined to beg-a

little life remained in me. Recalling a
kind cf exorcism I knew when a child,
3 tried it on theee raging animals. But
they seemed not to mind my incanta
tions. One Jumped over the gate, and
the rest made as if to follow. In this
critical situation I thought the best ex
orcism would be to cry for help. I did
co, end a 'peasant, half-nased, opened
the door of the hut.
"Who's that?" he asked, as he
quieted the dogs.
I told him that I was a wanderer and
wished to have lodging overnight.
"Bosje Mol (my God)," he said,
croesing himself. "On a night like
this:" And after ire had scrutinised me
he murmured to himself: "He's no
thiefâ only a little Jew."
"I deny shelter to no one, be he
Christian cr Jew," he eaid, as he
cpened the gate fop me.
I entered his hut. It was of the
came style as those of most muxhiks;
one square, earth- floored room, the un
plastered walls and low celling of
which were black with smoke. One
fourth of it occupied by a large brick
oven; another fourth taxen up by a
largÂ« bed which was commonly known
as the "family bed;" and the remain
ing space filled by a long, unpainted
table with a rough bencn along each
elde of it. a pall of water, a manger for
the pigs, and a wooden dish for the
rabbits that were crowded together in
a. comer. An oil lamp burned before a
Â»maU image of Christ, placed beside
the window, or rather the small square
hole which served as one.

gasped, clutching the priest's"' Hand."
But not another word. Incoherent
babbling was all I could hear. * The
priest took a cross from his pocket and
pressed it to the dying lips.
I rose unsteadily to my feet. The
members of the family were rising one
by one; the rabbits, crowded together
in a corner, were, munching withered
cabbage leaves; the pigs 'under the
"family bed" squealed and grunted;
the chickens cackledin the coop under
the ovenrâ it was daybreax already.' '
Without so much as a "thank you" I
slipped out of the hut, leaving the
peasant in his last gasps and the priest
whispering words of absolution In his
ears. â¢ .. Â¦ .'â¢Â¦ . ."" 'Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦.' Â¦'. > -~"

recalled the Incidents of my' life and

the past shows that you committed this
crime.* And then says he: 'But I'll
help you and set you free If you'll do a
trifle for me!' 'Yes,' says I. 'Do you
know Marlanka, the washwoman?*
This word of encouragement from the
priest seemed to give strength to the
dying man, and though shivering vio
lently he proceeded more easily: "Oh,
batiushka, my great sins have preyed
upon my life for the last ten yearsâ*
ever since I was seized in the devil's
clutches!" /â
"""Confess and lighten your burdened '
heart," the priest encouraged him
again, making the %ign of the cross.
The dying man seemed to be so agi
tated with his forthcoming confession
that fer some time he cuuld not speak.
Then he resumed, a gasp after each
choppy sentence:
"Batiushka, I wish my soul to go up
to God. 'i want to tell you all before I
die." Another long pause. "About '
fifteen years ago I worked for a 'Jew.
His name was -Yudel Abramo witch." #
I sat up and gasped for breath at the ,
mention of my father's name- ' â¢ ..
"He % treated me well, he did. But the

warnings, but the devil would not let

"Confess and bring salvation to your

The priest crossed himself and with
eyes uplifted murmured: "May the

'on both sides' of the long "reclining

side, like so many pendulums in a

their. lessons in as - loud a voice as
each pleased, arid In as many different

piped halachas (statutes) f - in sweet

groaned: some shouted and some
hummed In hushed voices; some talked
and some whispered; some winked and
some stared idioticallyâ an uproar of
Talmudlc , learning! The sight was
purely oriental, unadorned by Greqian
art or modern European polish.
Among the clamorous rows of stu
dents there were representatives of all
climes, and of all generations of the
race; old-looking, swarthy. Arabian
faces; delicately cut Grecian faces;
'faces with commanding Roman noses:
â¢Â¦andy-complexioned Russian faces;

very hollow *nd overgrown with a
tousled b!ack* beard, over which hung
his long, Eilky fells, which frequently
annoyed him when he bent forward to
thread a needle. A skull cap invaria
bly crowned his head. The material of
this cap was a puzzle to me. At first
I thought it was velvet because of its
gloss and blackness, but after closer
observation I found the gloss to have
been chiefly due to the pressure of his
hat, under which he always wore hid
cap, in order (as he once explained to
me) that he might not remain bare
headed when delivering clothes in
places where the removal of his cap
would be necessary, so I changed my
opinion.
Groone was Menke's second love, and
by no means had he been disappointed
in hiS second venture, for in a little
over seven months he had been blessed
with a kaddish (a male child to say
prayers after a dead parent). At first
the continued existence of this kad
dish was gravely doubted; neverthe
less, he grew ta!l and stooped, and had
as fine a pair of crooked shoulders as
ever overtowered a folio of Talmud.
His name was Samuel, which was
fondly diminished by his mother to
Shmulke. which his father, who talked
through his noseâ because that organ
was broken a little below the Semitic
bridge â pronounced Shmunke; and as
the kaddish likewise talked through his
nose he also had difficulty iWpronounc
ing his own name, and therefore spoke
of himself as Shmunke Menke
Shmunke's.
Although Menke was very anxious to
have a daughter (for as Groone used to
complain, ehe had enough bedclothes
for half a dozen daughters), the "Lord
had shut up her womb," and Shmunke
remained a ben-yocrid (an only son).
Naturally, Shmunke "was given to the
Lord all the days of his life," and he
was destined by his parents to become
a rabbi. And In the manner of tho
prophet there never came scissors upon
his -head, so that at the time of my
forming his acquaintance he could knot
his pelis under his chin. He was now
about 18 years old. and his mind was
constantly rambling in the cul-de-sac
of the Babylonian compilation. '
There were only two rooms in the
house. One served for the kitchen, for
- the bedroom of the husband and wife,
and also for the tailor shop, in whiih
Menke and Groone sat from sunrise till
late at night over their work. The
otheV was Shmunke's room; it was al
ways clean and neat. I was supposed
to share this room with him, but It so
happened that it was practically mine
alone, for Shmunke stayed "in the yes
hiva, to the extreme joy of his pÂ»>or
parents, every day and the greater part
of every night, and shook himself and
shouted as loud as his lungs would al
low over a large and heavy volume of
Talmud.
The sec-ind day after I had conic to
reside tvith these people Groone came
into my room, smoothing her heavy
wig. and a little awkwardly opened
conversation. "Teploffker (most of the
students were called by the name of
the town th<?y came from). I hate to
intrude upon people; you know, it is
not my nature. As I always say to my
husband (may. he live a hundred and
twenty years!) gome people like to im
pose, but bur natures are quite thÂ»;
other way. We know our station. . Not
like Beile Yentc Mollie Zippe>, who

Â¦well, if not for my Shmunke.' who.
Rabbi Brill said with his own holy
mouth, is going to be a shining light in
Israel, I would be no more than the
ordinary working people. I admit that
I would be no more than Yankle, Chaim
or Todres. But when God blessed us
with such a son-Vwell, you can't help
feeling a little proud, as the Talmud
saysâ he! he! you will excuseme if I
misquote it; I am only a woman (and
her countenance assumed a smiling
grimace), but I think it says that good
children pull their parents out of the
blazes of hell, and of course a person
can't help, you know, feeling a trifle
elated over such a blessing.^ As I say,
it is not In our nature, neither in mine
nor in my husband's (may he live a
hundred and twenty years!)â but really
what do you think of our Shmunke?
Are there any brighter boys in the
yeshiva? Really, I am only a poor.
Ignorant woman: but is there anybody
who knows more than Shmunke? And
â " She suddenly checked herself and
with a beaming face she said: "I hear
him coming, and I must be quick. My!
my! How hungry my poor darling must
be!"
And !n a jiffy the table In "our" room
was covered with a white cloth and a
savory dinner was set upon it. Menke
and his wife never breakfasted on any
thing better than black dre;id and chi
cory, and their second meal (for they
ate twice a day only) consisted of the
same rye yread. a piece of herring and
milk-washed barley. -
When Shmunke was In the house his
parents never talked sibove a whisper;
then their thoughts fceemed to be cen
tered upon him alone. I^ate at night,
while Shmunke pondered in the yeshiva
over some commentary upon the Tal-
Katia, Menke and Groone would hold
mud. and while I sleepily thought of
council regarding their ben-yochid's
future. The subject was always the
same, and their talk always was much
as follows: *\
"Menke"â thus the dialogue would
'commence â "Menke, are . you already
asleen? (Menke would stir in his bed.
evidently desirous of slumber.) ilenke,

Why not? (No reply from Menke.)
Now teil me why not, you s tiff- neck ed

CHAPTER. XV.
THE "SHA."
â¢However great the 'contrast between,
the life I had led in the sudya's house
and 'that I spent with, these humble
people, the next few months passed
rapidly and almost happily. It is true
the sacred fire which Katia had kin
dled in my young heart did. not
smolder, and the ambition which she
had aroused in me grew daily and took
full possession of me; but I was con
scious of the heavy , shackles that
checked my movements, and was dis
creet enough to keep still when I real
ized that the raising of my voice would
bring me no relief.
I learned the ways and manners of my
schoolmates and became one of them.
I learned to sway myself backward'and
forward and shout the , Talmudic lore
at the top of my voice. ?By and by I
even learned to comdemn Rabbi Brill
for being henpecked, and his young
wife for curtailing the students' sti
pends.
Ephraim was as commanding in this
great institution as he had been in that
dingy little Talmud-Torah. Here, to'o,
he was the leading spirit, and was
huted by Rabbi Brill and the other
seminary officials as he had been feared
by Shlomka Gazlen. Although the
school authorities- knew that he v.as
violating every rule of the faculty, he
was never molested f on that score.
But he frequently .gdt. himself into
trouble by" taking the part of others.
A few days beforej the; clo^e of the
winter semester :the of forty
five students were reduced twenty per
cent, and ' a 'number .of students who
had been caught reading "prohibifod
books" -were given notice to resign.-
Ephraim promptly took up the cause
of his. unfortunate fellow-students. â¢ He
openly condemned the' actions of /the
roch-h'shlva and agitated \ fearlessly
among his classmates. The yeshiva
was In a state of uprising. Students

I urged him to abandon "the ' plan, but
he said sharply that I was just like a
girl â afraid of everybody; and then he
abruptly left me.
In the evening, after prayers, every
. student, resumed his, studies as usual.
Rabbi Brill, as was his wont,' walked
between the rows of desks, and up and
down the long passage between
tall, white "four columns"' which sup
ported the oriental structure". He
moved slowly, his thumbs stuck,rest
fully In his abnet, his streimel (round
fur -hat) tilted back, and cast suspi
cious glances here-and there. Present
ly Rabbi Brill reached his armchair,
which looked like a kingly throne, and
opened a pocket-edition volume of the
mishna (a syllabic digest of the Tal
mud).
.Then suddenly, "Sh! S.h! Sh! Sh!"
hissed. five hundred breaths. And just
as suddenly all were hushed. , -
Rabbi Briir leap'ed from his chair,
and ; his ' energetic, .^powerful face
clouded . .with rage. He .turned his
piercing; eyes right and left, but none
of the students looked at him.
"Sh!-Sh! Sh! Sh!" again came from
all sides, like so many hissing snakes.
The ma'shgiach â¢ slapped his desk
wrathfully.v "Silence!" 'he cried.
"Silence!"- shouted his assistant!' Â¦
But their commands did nothing, to
quiet the sibilant uproar.
- Rabbi Brill's anger seemed to be"
aroused to Its highest pitch, but he
still . restrained his feelings, and con
tinued walking down the passage be
tween the v "four columns," trying to
subdue the class\with his looks. But of
no avail. His patience gave way, and
he cried out in his hoarse-voice: "Stop

declared with tears in his eyes, and he
said that he/would rather see the doors
of the ytshlva closed forever than per
mit the reading of "pernicious books,"
as he called novels and philosophic
works.
Ephraim saved others, but himself he*
could hot save. The authorities could
not overfook the part he had taken in
.this uprising, and immediately ordered
his expulsion.
One beautiful springlike morning a
few days later a light cart moved
slowly through the main street of
Javolin, and after it came a long train
of whistling, singing, shouting stu
dents. When the hilarious- procession
reached the mail-coach road leading to
Vilno the, cart* halted and all voices
were hushed; all eyes were raised to
Ephraim,' who mounted the caf t. He
waved his hat and expanded his chest,
but for a moment it seemed 'he could
not give vent to his overflowing senti
ments. His eyes glowed like burning
charcoal and his whole body quivered.
Then he controlled himself and poured
forth his ideas. with all the passion and
fire of his nature. He spoke of the new
epoch which was beginning with the
young generation, of fanaticism, of en
lightenment, and of the mysterious fu
ture.
The audience listened breathlessly."
When he had finished speaking they
burst Into a frenzy of cheering, and
when the time of departure came every
. ojje. embraced and kissed him.
.Long after the happy gathering had
returned to their crude studies, long
after the cart that carried my friend
had, disappeared from sight, I stood
brooding by the roadside, with my head
drooped over my chest â Just as I had "
stood on "Bloody Hill" years before,
when Ephraim had left me that first
time. I was again left friendless, and
idfealn I began to brood ever the pas,t.
yearning the more after my sweet
Katia, and longing after the books I
had read in her house, and (with shame
in my heart do I record this) a faint
hatred against the Talmud and against
Jewish life generally struck root in the
depths of my heart.
CHAPTER XVI.
- ' THE REAWAKENING.
The following summer was the begin
ning of a great epoch in the history of
tho yeshiva, and also in the lives of all
Russian Jews. There was a reawaken
ingâa ressuirection, so to , spaak â of
the low-sunken race.' The flood vt en
lightenment that streamed from
western lands swept even through the '
inclosures of the uncouth Ghettos.
That summer the broad-minded mon
arch, the emancipator of the peasants,
also showed his willingness to liberate
the Jews. His first step was to admit
them to schools from which they had
been barred. Hitherto the young peo
ple had been restrained within by the
demoniac clutches of fanaticism and
without by the tyrannical hand of the
Government. The' announcement of the
relaxation of the latter flashed through,
the dingy Jewries like a new light. The
young generation was dazzled with the
brilliancy 'of opportunities for en-.
Â¦ llgljtenment,']that had dawned upon
.them.: .There was confusion In the
synagogues and uprising in the yes
hivas.. Children .ran away from their
fanatical parcntfi^-and young Talmud
is^ ;from their wives.. Haskolo! Has
kolo!; (culturey..becaHie. the.: cry .of tho
yu-ung. 'Â¦ -Â¦ ",- '- â¢â¢-
â¢ Naturally .the- ;mashglach and his
"scouts", were now more active than
ever' and kept^closer. watch over the
students on the "suspected list"â a list
that Included the very brightest stu
dents of the Institution. It -became a
daily occurrence - to search students'
rooms, break open their trunks, burn
their "forbidden books,"/ and expel
them from town that they might not
corrupt others. But these acts of ty
ranny could not destroy the craving for
the new thought. Prohibited literature
continued to be read behind bolted
doors and in sequestered spots of the
woods which surrounded Javolln, and
in spite of the mashgiach's careful
scrutiny of the mall, "forbidden" books
and journals continued to be smuggled
in. It was even discovered that some
of the contributors to the black-listed
magazines were seminary students,
who concealed their identity under fic
titious names.
But in none of these acts of Insubor
dination did I take part, nor did the
least suspicion fall upon me. I never
touched a literary book or a periodical,
nor did I even breathe to any one that
1 could read Russian. The faculty
wished me to study the Talmud and
the Talmud only, and I obeyed *helr
rules religiously. I had had enc-ugh
trouble and now craved peace. I fol
lowed In the footsteps of my room
mate Shmunke, and little by nttle my
mind became as dull and Inactive as
his. My only thought apart from the
Talmud, and that only a fleeting one,
was a fragmentary recollection of
Katia and her father. Fanaticism had
grown stronger and stronger in me un
til it had induced me to believe that to
think of anything but tho Talmud â
even of Katia â was an unpardonable
sin, and I scrupulously avoided all sins.
But changes happen unexpectedly. It
was lateâ near the first blush, of morn
ing. I sat in the yeshiva, sw/aylng my
body over the Talmud and trying to
unravel seme knotty point. For there
are many knotty points in that crude
and marvelous Babylonian encyclope-jj
dia, U) which .hundreds of commenta- g
tors have copiously added knots In their
earnest endeavor to simplify difficul
ties. There are Tesopheth. Marshoa,.
Mahram, the rc-sh, and numerous oth*r
hair-spliting N expounders, each one of
whom Is tryjng to straighten the other,
only ' to become the more entangled
himself. There is no end of questions
and no end of answers, but the radi
caj question was never asked and never
answered. But let me not fall into- the
Tarfnudlc style, but proceed with my
story.
Only one other student still lingered
in the great classroom â Nehemlah Ro
sencranz, a dark, slight young man of
about 21 or 22, with a pair v of nervous,
thoughtful eyes and, tightly pressed
lips. The younger boys looked up to
him with a feeling which almost
amounted to reverence. The mashiach
and his scouts would hardly have !
dared to search his room, even if they I
had suspected him of wrong-doing. 8
Rabbi Brill often found himself per- R
plexed when Nehemiah would begin to B
question during a Talmudic lecture, a
Besides honor, he received a large sti- 8
pend, which enabled him to live as Â¦
comfortably as the richest boys of the I
school. fc
I occasionally glanced across the!
room at Rosencranz. Several times IB
saw him peer around* suspiciously. My I
curiosity was aroused and I watched B
him furtively. I soon detected that he Â¦
was reading a little volume lying be- fi
tween his large folio of Talmud with a B
guilty air . like one counting counter- 1
feits. I stole softly behind him, and S
glancing over his shoulder I saw that W
the characters of the book were Rus- B
sian. a
He was startled as he locked up, and 8
hastily covered the pages of the book jj
with both hands. |j
"Don't be afraid," I said. "I merely Â»
wished to know what you were read- B
ing." rf
His face grew pale. At first he could 1
FULL SCHOLASTIC DRESS AT BERKELEY

ley the professors and instruct
ors of the University, of Califor
nia and its Affiliated Colleges ap
pear in full scholastic dress.. â¢ To the
vast throngs who. usually attend these
exercises the gowns are picturesque,
but meaningless. Few realize that,
like the uniform or trappings of a na
val or military officer, the official gown
of a college professor means something.
The different styles of sleeves, the
hoods, the velvet bands, the colors
worn, ail-tiave-to the initiated a spe
cial significance.
Has the gown of your favorite pro
tesEor angel sleeves or bell sleeves?
la his hood faced with white, blue or
sf-arlfct velvet, and is it lined .ywith
crimson or maroon silk? These and
kmditd questions when answered
would tell where he was graduated and
â¢.>hat degree he holds.
There are three styles of gowns in
general use â the bachelor's, the mas
tor's and the doctor's. All of the
American gowns are made of black
\\ coiV-n or sillc material and, to the cas
ual observer, the chief difference in ap
pearance lies in snap? of the sleeve*..
The bachelor's gown, as worn by stu
d-nts about to take the bachelor's de
gijee, or by', professors holding only a
bachelor's, de&ree,, has long pointed
t=lfeYÂ£.Â«, not unlike the angel sleeves of
f ur grandmothers. The master's gown
has a Ion-' sleeve, reaching 4 below the
knee. It 4s square at the end andhasa
flickif fhrred curve at the back just
above the square end. The front of the
sleeve is closed, the arm. coming
thjcuph s a sMt^near the elbow. .
The doctor's gown has full open bell
sleeves. This gown is faced down the
fronts with broad bands of velvet and
the s'.eevc? have three bars of velvet
arrncs them. .
The doctor's is the only, gown that
â¢â¢an- be trimmed with velvet, and here
home variation is permitted. The vel
vÂ«t-may be all black, or. black edged,
with th? coJor indicating thj, denart
mont, as srecn for medicine.' or the vel
vet m.iy b? wholly of tho department
< as a black doctor's gown faced

of divinity, or purple velvet 'facings

the best usage. . .. â .
The caps are alike in shap*v flat mor
tarboards, and are made of black doth,
though nn*Â«-nc-w and then sees a .velvet
doctor's tap. â¢ The gold, tassel can be
usfd only on a doctor's cap.
Gowns ar.d hoods are worn in Brit
ish universities and our American
gowns are modeled after those worn in
England. The -hoods worn at Oxford
and Cambridge are picturesque, but the
arrangement of colors is arbitrary arid
it lemained for the American universi
ties to adopt a code which would ren
der departments and college colors in
telligible from Massachusetts to Cali
fornia.
There are three styles of hoods, as of
gowns: Bachelor's, master's and doc-
tor's. The hoods are black, with a silk
lining of the official color of the insti
tution granting the degree. All hoods
an* faced with velvet of a color that
indicates from what department the de
gree was received.
Th<* colors for the various uni
versity departments are: . Arts and
letters, white; philosophy, blue:
science, gold yellow; medicine, green;
pharmacy, olive; law, purple; theology,
scarlet; dentistry, lilac: veterinary
science, gray; fine arts, brown; music,
pink.
There is usually a real or fancied hls-
torical basis for the selection of these
colors. White .'ur.Js used on the Ox
ford and \Cambridge A. B. gowns:
blue for. the degrees, in philosophy is
the color of truth and wisdom: gold
yellow is emblematic of the r wealth
added to the world by scientific re
search: medicine follows the army
regulation df the green stripe on an
army surgeon's uniform; law uses the
royal purple of the King's Court and
theology the scarlet which for cen
turies Cardinals have worn as typical
of their love and zeal for. the faith;
the Oxford doctors of music wear pink
brocade. . v â¢ .
When you have noted the facine of
the hood, look at its lining, for there
the glory of college colors displays
itself in full. If the college has one
color, as the blue of Yale or the ma
roon of Chicago, the hood is
lined throughout with silk of that
color. If more than one color, as blue
and gold for California or orange antl
black for Princeton, the hood Jinlngia^
of one color, with a chevron of the other*
color. If there are more than two col
ors the double or treble chevron is
used.
The college colors as worn by grad
uates of some of pur leading Amer
ican institutions are arranged in
hoods, as follows: University of Cali
fornia, gold, with blue chevron; Michi
gan, maize, with blue chevron: Johns
Hopkins, black, with gold chevron;
Princeton, orange, with black chevron;
Yale, blue; Harvard, crimson; Brown,
brown; Cornell, carnellan, with two
white chevrons; Chicago, maroon;
Columbia, light blue, with white
chevron; University of Pennsylvania,
red, with blue chevrons; Stanford,
cardinal.
German universities do not use
hoods, neither do they, in our under
standing of the term, have colors.
Their colors are those of the German
state in which the university is located.
At a conference of professors, who
were graduates of German universities,
held in Chicago In 1895. it was decided,
that they would adopt the American
system of caps and gowns and hoods,
lining the hood with the appropriate
university color overlaid with a tri
chevron of, the German national colors,
black, white and red.
The leading German universities
.are represented on American faculties
by their graduates wearing hood.*
lined for: University of Berlin, pur
ple with trichevron of black, white
and red; University, of Hallo, white
with trichevron of black, white and
red; University .of Heidelberg, red
with trichevron of black, white and
red; University of Jena, green above
gold with trichevron of black, white
and red; University of Gottigen. yel
low with trichevron of black, white
and red.
Professors holding degrees* from
English universities sometimes wear
an English hood, the red hood of the
'loctor being most commonly seen.
The wearing of a full scholastic
dress is rather a new thing in the Uni
versity of California. President Wheel-"
er having introduced the American
system used by all of our leading uni
versities. One lias only to compare
the commencement processions of re
cent years with the motley display of
Prince Alberts, cutaways and sack
coats of former presidencies to realize
how much more dignified the cap,
gown and hood Is. An old lady was
heard to remark at last commence
ment: "How much finer looking these
professors are than those they had a
few years ago."
She did not realize that many of the
men who passed her had been on the
faculty ten years.
3I BECOME A TEACHER.
CHAPTER XX.
Thus my whole past flashed through
my mind, and the present stood before
me in all Its grimness. My heart be
came oppressed with bitterness. I
wished I could cry aloud, so that the
big synagogue, the marketplace, the
town and the surrounding fields and
So. to the synagogue I went to spend
the night. Now while I write I see
myself sitting In a corner between two
tall bookcases crammed with -ancient
volumes, and near the Dutch oven that
reached to the high celling. My eyes
are so blurred with tears that every
thing about me is watery and dark. I
stare stupidly In front of me without
thinking of anything in particular.
Fragments of the past come and gq
like small tatters of clouds in a stormy
sky; they shift and float and drive
one another, but I see nothing * clear,
nothing definite. One moment I think
of the present, and my heart swells
with deadly hatred against the Jews
and their religion and their rabbis.
Another moment my anger against my
own people is allayed.. I. recall Judge
Blalnick; I think of the. peasant's con
fession; I vaguely reflect upon the in
cidents of my father's death. And
again my sore heart smarts and burns
with hatredâ not. against the Jews, but
against the world that enslaved and
degraded them. And again the Jew â
the old generation â the, young genera
tion â prejudice; and. again my brain
burns with fever at the cruelty of
their fanaticism. Ah, Katia! Katia!
like a flash of lightning that splits the
clouds asi^nder, her face,, her voice,
the vivid recqllectlons or her charm
ing ways recurred to my mind. Ah,
Katia! Katia! the lapse intervening
between her and the present vanishes,
and my heart is yearning, craving,
burning with anguish and desire to
Bee her/ to talk to her, to ask her for
help.
Toward morning one desire -took
definite shape amid the chaos of my
mindâ a desire to emancipate myself
from the Jewish bondage, to; become
freeâ free, and cast off tne yoke that
crushed my father, my grandfather,
and his father before -.himâ to wefrk
and work and work and becomeâ not
a great rabbi, who sinks In the mire of
superstition^ and fanaticismâ but â¢ a
great man such as Katia wished to see
me, like Pushkin or Gogol or Lermon
toff. .; . â¢ Â¦ , Â¦Â¦
When driven out of my Garden of
Eden I repaired to the synagogue. In
Lithuania the synagogue is a lyceum
where the most erudite of the Jewish
community, come together of an even
ing to vie in advancing hair-splitting
arguments and technical rljjmarole of
the Talmud; a board of trade where
business men discuss market prices and
competition; a club where friends meet
to chat over a cigarette or a pipe; a
center of gossip where everybody talks
of everybody else; a place of refuge
for the poor against whom every other
place Is closed; and s6metlmes an
arena where knotty fingers and matted
beards come in clone contact, and hats,
like comets, fly in the air. :
I WANDER A.GAIN,
CHAPTER XIX.
The following day my duties began.
It was true the time spent with little
Jacob was a trifle monotonous and
irksome, but the hours spent in in
structing Malke were not at all tedious.
From the flrBt I found pleasure in her
lesson period, and this pleasure grew
keener and keener. She was of a nat
urally happy disposition, mirthful and
witty, but at times melancholy fits
would come upon her, and she would
mope about the house with a sad, far
away look in her eyes. I could not un
derstand these r.-idely varying moods,
but I had a faint feeling that she was
being preyed upon by some secret
grief.
My time, aside from that devoted to
my pupils, was also well spent. The
climate was fresh and wholesome, the
environing scenery picturesque, a large
forest at a stone's throw, and my many
hours of leisure afforded me ample
opportunity for. meditation and day
dreams In which I took infinite delight.
For appearance's sake I kept a volume
of Talmud In my room, though I never
opened it, and in its stead I made good
use of a number of literary works
which I found In Malke's library, as
well as of the Bible, which, in spite of
my skepticism, was my favorite bool:.
And at night, alone in my quiet cham
ber, I would He awake and think f
the pastâ always' of the incidents of
the past; the, future stood hazily be
fore me . like a prophecy, on which I
never cared to d'well too long. In such
moments my thoughts would travel
back to Katia. and with one arm
thrown loosely over my eyes and my
face turned celllngward I would muse
for hours. The remembrance of her
father, like a tatter of cloud, would
soon begin to eclipse the happy light
of my mind, but each time I would
relegate this thought by sheer force of
wlll L and continue my delightful rumin
ation undisturbed. At last" my heaven
ly dream would end in a crushing
sense of hopelessness. I would become
conscious, as we so often do in dreams,
that I was' merely "dreaming a dream
that would never come true. And
slowly this charming vision would
move. back, back, and then sink lower
and lower, like a setting sun, and a new
phantasm would take Its place.
Vaguely. I would begin to think of my
pupil;, indefinitely her expressive look
would stand before me; faintly her
voice, full of pathos, would ring in my
ears; and little by little I would be
come possessed with a feeling, a desire,
as uncertain as the image in my mind's
eye.' I would thus continue to muse
until all else would leave my brain ex
cept the thought of Malke. The last
thought would lend speed to the beat
ing of my heart and would stir my pas
sions. "She seems to find no interest
in me" would flash through my mind.
And insignificant little incidents which
had passed between Malke and me
would Immediately spring to memory
defining more clearly the thought that
had just crossed my mind. This
thoueht would fill me with burning
jealousy, . and jealousy would arouse
my feelings. The more I thought of
I FIND MY DUTIES VERY AGREE
ABLE.
CHAPTER XXI.
(Continued Next Sunday.)
Neither my stay with Judge Blal
nick nor the fiery arguments of
Ephralm had shaken my belief in the
least. The exulting talk of Rosen
cranz would likewise have had no per
manent effect upon me bad he not im
mediately begun to take advantage of
the impression he had made. The fol
lowing day he gave me Spinoza's
Ethics. That Â« book shattered my
peaceful belief in a theological God.
The next book â which he borrowed for
me and brought to my lodgings hidden
under his coatâ was "The Blunderer In

until there Is no trace of It left.
I BEGIN TO DOUBT.
He thus poured forth his feelings,.
tears glistening in his eyes. He laid
bare before me the conditions of our
faith, the absurd system of the yes
hiva, how much energy was wasted on
useless studies while there were so
many better, more useful, nobler things
for which to spend one's life. He told
me of a secret society to which he be
longed, whose object was the promul
gation of liberal idea*, and he urged'
me to Join it and come into the light.
All this stirred the slumbering feelings
of my soul, revived the dying recollec
tions of Russian literature â of Katia.
and made me think and doubt.
The door of the yc-shiva opened soft
ly, and Rabbi Brill, clad in a long,
light robe, with tephilim (phylacteries)
on his head, stepped in like an appari
tion. He held his Mishna pocket edi
tion in one hand, with his Index finger
between the leaves, and with the other.
he was fondling the straps that hung
down from the tephilim. He stopped
in front of Nchcmlah and* me, and
smiling benignly said In his fatherly,
care-taking, hoarse voice, "The yes
hiva Is imposing a too heavy burden
on you children â always Nehemlah and
Israel," and he tapped us on the
shoulders in a most paternal manner.
And raising his eyes to the long clock
that hung on the wall at the entrance,
he edded: "So late, and only two of
you?"
CHAPTER XVII.
He spoke fervently; his eyes glowed
with inspiration. I drank in every
word that fell from his mouth, as if it
came from the lips of a prophet.
"Many youths." he continued zeal
ously. " who are endowed with- He
brew genius and who should be the
torch-bearers of true civilization and
enlightenment are rotting away in the
swamps of the synagogue. Ah, how
many brilliant gems- myriadE of them
â sink in the bottomless Talmudic
mire! Russia â Lithuania in particular â
Is an inestimable gold mine, but there
are no speculators found to work it.
Oh, the Talmud! the Talmud!" he cried
out with real pain and agony, his lips
trembling with agitation, "that golden
chain that throttles the Jewish youths
of Russia! Does not the Talmud itself
say. In commenting on the verse 'He
hath set me in dark places' (Lamen
tations), that means the Babylonian
Talmud? But our people are beginning
to open their eyes now that the Czar
has opened the schools to us. Ah! one
decade of toleration and liberty, and
our people 'will flourish as in the days
of old. It takes other nations a cen
tury to make a progressive step, but it
takes the Jews only a generation, a
quarter of a century, if liberty be given
them, to overtake them all. Awake,
Israel! The hour is striking now. If
you oversleep this chance, God knows
when the hour will strike for you
again."
He concealed Pushkin in his trousers
pocket and paused meditatively a few
minutes, as if he were hesitating
whether or not to speak. The dawn
phone through the long, arched win
dows of the seminary,, and Rosen
cranz's face grew paler and more
greenish from the cold morning light.
Then he clasped me by the hand and
ppoke impulsively: "You are blind â
you are blind. Do not remain in dark
ness and nebulous superstition. Flee
from the narrow compass of the syna
gogue. , There is a . larger, greater,
grander sphere than that circumscribed
by the boundaries of the orthodox
faith. The world is not as gloomy and
sordid as you have experienced it in
the inclocure of our 6elf-made Ghetto.
Waste no more of your profitable youth
and vigor of boyhood on the almost
obsolete genius of ancient generations.
Not everything that is old is necessar
ily sacred, and nothing is sacred be
cause it is old. Idolatry is the oldest
worship, for that matter. It Is the fee
bler element in man that reveres age;
the more vigorous vitality sympathizes
with old age, but never venerates % it."
He stared at me dubiously. Cut
there really was but one course open to
himâ to take me into his confidence. He
looked about fearfully, as if he did not
he said in a low voice: "This is Push
kin." And looking up to me he contin
ued: 'Oh, perhaps you don't know who
Pushkin is. He is the greatest Rus
sian poet, and his verges are so beauti
fully wild that they almost tenr my
heart when I rcad N them."
I looked Incredulous. 1 wished not to
disclose to him the fact that I had read
Pushkin. Pretending perfect ignor
ance and innocence, I returned: "I
would not read such poems."
"Ah! it is because you do not under
stand them," he rejoined warmly, and
his black eyes sparkled. 'If you did
you would forget eating and drinking
and sleeping and do nothing but read
his verses. It makes your heart throb
and the blood in your veins run
warmer, swifter. It Is not like the
Talmudâ it is more inspiring, more
elevating."
I stared amazed. This from Rosen
cranz's lips!
I still feigned innocence: "But they
are gentile books! How can you com
pare them to the Talmud?"
not _answer; then he stammered: "It Is
no â nothing."
"I won't denounce you," I reassured
him. "You may show me the little
book."
He rose from his seat, and laying
his hand gently on my shoulder he con
tinued: "Ah, the young generation!
Our young men do not realize the pre
clousness of the Talmud. It is now,
as it has been In centuries past, our
stronghold and a pillar of light that
has guided us through all darkness.
But for it what would become of our
Jewish brains, dulled by. gentile cru
elty and persecution? And what would
our morals be but for Its mighty In
fluence? What became of the Kar
raites after they ! abandoned the Tal
mud? Talmud is like salt, which must
be preserved, if not for its own sake,
for the preservation of the Jew. Its
beautiful legends, its Instructive pre
cepts, its ethical fables, its brilliant
sayings, and the vigorous genius that
permeates every line of itâ ahl the
Talmud, and the Talmud only,- has
made the Jew indestructible, everlast
ing!" . ' . .
The rabbi's voice had become mourn
ful, and tears were trickling down his
face. "The gaudy, appearance of . Eu T
ropean civilization is dazzling the eyes
of the young. The same was true
when Greece was In its glory; then the
Jews wished to shine as Hellenes, not
as Jews. The same happened a short
while ago in Germany; the same is
going on now in our own land. Ah!" â
he sighed deeply, .and a stream of
tears gushed forth over his already
wet cheeksâ "it is either to remain a
Jew In the old sense or give up Juda
ism entirely. The Inherent faculty of
criticism In byr. race In a scientific age
will not tolerate Judaism or any other
religion. The gentile can be cultured
and still remain true to his faith, but
the Jew Is too critical for.^that. It is
either belief and dogma or science and
infidelism. What has become of most
of the followers of Mendelssohn, who
planned so wisely and sincerely? The
great rabbi and philosopher would re
torn to his grave had he risen to be
hold the result of his arduous labor.
Only Moses . Mendelssohn could be
learned in philosophy and be a Jew.
Woe! Woe!" and the rabbi's tears
1 My hatred of orthodoxy suddenly
flamed un. I was on the point of an
swering the Mashgiach by bursting in
to a fierce denunciation of Judaism,
but Rabbi Brill ordered them all out
of the room by a wave of his hand. I
was following, knowing well my sen
tence, when the rabbi's voice, hoarse
as if choked with tears, checked me.
"Listen, my child. I accepted you
in this institution when no other
place* was open to you. I allowed you
a stipend almost beyond my. power. I
did this all for you with the under
standing, that von should study the
Talmud. But you have devoted your
time to other thingsâ to Haskolo; you
are worshiping strange gods. Modern
culture is like poison â a cure to one.
death to another. To Judaism it is
death." ".
I still made no reply. There was
such a whirl of emotions within me
that I could not have spoken had I
wanted to. Rabbi Brill held his sad,
piercing eyes fixed on me and sighed
softly.
"So you confess, Teploffker," hissed
the Mashgiach again, "that these 'Ep
icurean books' are your property and
that you have read them?"
"Are these books yours?" he de
manded, pointing at the bundle under
the scout's arm.
I made no answer,
As Shmunke . spent about eighteen
hours daily in the yeshiva. I pursued
my new studies in our room without
fear of detection, fc'hmunke's fanati
cism reached the point where religion
and barbarism meet. He would
look into a mirror because he regarded
such an act effeminate, and he would
not pass between two women on the
ground of immorality. He not only
bore the yoke of orthodoxy, but he
even hated with the zealous hatred of
a savage any one who did not bear It.
However, I little suspected that he was
spying upon me.
One cold, rainy spring morning, sev
eral months after I began my new
studies, I was brooding over a big folio
of Talmud, though my thoughts were
for from the subject before me, when
the mashgiach's assistant came up to
me and whispered in nay ear that I
should forthwith appear before Rabbi
Brill. I followed him out of the yes
hiva into the rabbi's study, my brain
filled with wild fears of evil. Rabbi
Brill sat in his large armchair, his face
clouded with sadness. His young wife
stood haughtily in the doorway be
tween the library and the adjoining
room. Behind the rabbi's chair stood
the mashgiach and his scouts. The
looks of all of them pinned me as I
stepped over the threshold; the bigotry
of a Torquemada was stamped on each
face except that of the rosh-h'shlva.
One of the scouts held a bundle of
books under his arm. At the sight of
these a chill went through me. I knew
my fate.
"You are Israel Teploffker, and you
have your lodgings with Menke the
tailor, hey?" inquired the mashgiach
In his hissing, whistle-like voice. .,;
I AM BETRAYED.
I told Nehemiah of my thoughts, and
he smiled, saying: "Weil, you are al
ready saved* The knowledge of one's
ignorance is wisdom." . '^
CHAPTER XVIII.
the Paths of Life." My heart throbbed
violently as I glanced at its title. This
novel, which had Just appeared, was
the dread of the rabbis and fanatics
and was' condemned by 'the Jewish
clergy. The vital genius of its author
rhool; the very foundation of Judaism.
It. was a book filled with graphic de
scriptions of our Eordld Jewish life and
caustic criticism of our absurd reli
gious customs. I al?o found myself a
blunderer In the paths of life.
I raced feverishly through volumes
of philosophy, history and literature.
As I plunged deeper and deeper Into
modern studies (as I called everything
that* was not Talmudic) a scorn for
theology and for Jewish learning in
particular arose In my heart. Finally
I accepted two philosophic truths: "By
good. I understand that. which wo know
is positively useful to us. By evil. I
understand that which we positively
know hinders us from possessing any
thing that is good." And I asked my-,
self: "Am I pursuing good by the study
of the Talmud? Do I not positively
know that this hinders me from pos
sessing everything that is good?" I
shuddered as I answered myself.
"Indeed! indeed!" the good-natured
Reb Dovidle Interrupted him. "I al
ways like to have mezum'en (three men
to, the benediction) at my table. Why,
certainly, let him come."
Samson introduced me to Reb Do
vidle, who extended me a cordia)' in
vitation to remain with him over the
Sabbath.
As Reb Dovidle, his young son. whom
he led by the hand, and I approached
his house, two little children came
running to meet their father, with Joy
ous shouting: "Gut ShaDbos, papa-
Gut Shabbos." s He bent down, kissed
them, and the children clung to the
skirts of his frock coat. Opening the
dt-or, Reb Dovidle greeted in a low ca
dence of voice: ' "Gut Shabbos, Gittele
âGut Shabbos."
His wife. Gittele, beamed with Joy
and her diamond ear-rings twinkled as
they bobbed In the light of the candle
on the table. Everybody looked happy
â Sabbath eve spoke from every face.
Reb Dovidle kissed his 'dark-haired
daughter, leaned his hands on the lit
tle children's head and murmured a
blessing. Then walking leisurely up
and down the room and clapping his
hands gleefully, he hummed: "Who
can find a virtuous woman? For her
price is above rubles. The heart of her
husband doth safely trust in her, so
that he shall have no need of spoil.
She layeth her hands to the spindle,
and her hands hold the distaff. She
stretcheth out her hand to the poor,
yea, she reacheth forth her hand to
the needy," etc.
Thus hummed the happy Reb Do
vidle in Hebrew, and his soft voice
quavered In quaint undulations while
he beamed upon his wife and children
"like olive plants round about the ta
ble." Gittele read in a low voice:
"Peace be to you, angels of service,
angels eternal of the King of Kings,
the Holy One, blessed be He."
During the meal Reb Dovidle asked
me how long I had stayed at Javolin
and. where I was going, to which I re
plied (with shame do I record it) not
the truth, but rather what I thought
best for me. Then he asked me if I
knew of- a young man who would like
to teach Hebrew In a small village
about fifteen miles away. Without
waiting for my answer he ndderi:
"The work would not be hard. My
brother-in-law has only a little boy of
about seven and a daughter of about
seventeen. The Instructor would have
to i be with them only a few hours a
day."
I was silent a moment. It occurred
to me that here was a good opportun
ity: to make a little money to tide me
through my first uncertain" weeks in
Vllno, Bo I told him l was willing to
accept a position myself lor the sum
mer.
And early Sunday morning I started
for Dubrovka. armed with i a letter of
introduction to Mr. Nosen Taklff.
I was ashamed to beg. but what will
not a person do when he is tired and
hungry, without a farthing In his
pocket? After service the dwarfish
Â¦ghammeg invited me to follow him to
the entrance hall. I took my stand
beside him atÂ» the door and patiently
waited.
"Gut Shabbosâ Gut Shabbos." the
worshipers saluted each other, every
face wearing a look of contentment;
"Gut Shabbos." the children greeted
their fathers; "Gut Shabbos," the -poor
submissively 'greeted the rich; "Gut
Shabbos." the humble beggars greeted
everybody; "Gut Shabbosâ Gut Shab
bos." kept on buzzing in the synagogue
as the largt crowd passed through the
narrow hallway.
Presently the shammes, who had
b^en scanning the passers by, stopped
one of the worshipers â a venerable
looking man with a fine, broad, Jet
black beard and happy, smiling eyes,
who was followed by ;tjvo men, one on
crutches and the other with an empty,
dangling sleeve. "Gut Shabbos, Reb
Dovidle â Gut Shabbos," the shammes
greeted him.
"Gut Shabbos, Reb Samson," re
turned Reb Dovidle.
"Reb Dovidle," proceeded the sham
mes respectfully, and scratching the
back of his head, "a â Reb Dovidle â a â
a young 'man â a â a â a student from
Javolin â a "-
I went to the synagogue and Inquired
for the shammf-s (sexton). I found
him standing on a high chair, with
several assistants around him, lighting
the t'Hiidles of the traditional menofah
(candlestick}; He was a dwarfish man
with wot p?iis and a shiny forehead.
In response to my question as to
whether he cÂ»uld procure me a place in
vhich to srtay over the Sabbath, he
shrugged his shoulders and grumbled :
"Too late now â too late." However,
after I' had /incidentally Informed him
that. I came from Javolin Yeehlva a
cert J> in deference came into his manner
and he said; "Stay here till after
service."
At the c!ose.of the day I arrived at
a small town wholly inhabited by Jews.
As I came into the principal thorough
faro, the beadle, with His head thrown
back and his hands over his ears,
rushed through the streets proclaiming
in stentorian voice. "In Shoo! Herein!"
which was the signal for merchants to
clc?e their places of business and go to
the synagogue. I was reminded that it
was Friday. As I was hungry and
fatigued from my long trip, I decided,
if J rould get h place to stay, to remain
here over the Sabbath.
forests and brooks and ponds would
echo-again and again the great an
guish of my soul. .
At daybreak I took my little bundle
under my arm and left the synagogue.
I had decided to go to' Vllno. Vilno
was the Lithuanian Jerusalem, where
the Jews were already awakening
from their fanatical slumber. There,
perhaps, IrulKht fine! means to con
tinue my "modern studies" in the gym
nasium. I had no money to hire a
coach, so I made up my mind, to walk.
The distance was only a' hundred
versts, and I could get there on foot
in four days. . , ~,
I did not answer a word. I gathered*
my few belongings from the floor and
rolled them into, a bundle. "Indeed,
this very minute." added Shmunke's
mother, who had followed him into our
room. "I cannot keep you in my
house a half second." Oh! oh! the
chorem (ban)! Only four years ago
the two daughters of . 'Avrennl der
Schwarze' died in one night because
Rabbi Brill put the ban on them, and
the Mashgiach told me I must drive
you out of the house without a sec
ond's delay or the ban will follow."
Groone wrung her hands as she â¢ de
livered this monologue.
."Oh! ohj the chorem!'* Menke also,
ventured the remark, but a glance
from Groone seemed . to put him oft
again, and he went on stitching the
stiff lining on his lap. , .
Like Adam and. Eve* ."som.e natural
tears I dropped but wiped them so^n,"
and. "with wandering -steps, and bIAw"
I took my solitary way from the PaYa
dlse, wktched by the piercing glances
c-f the/cherublm. j Menke. and Groqne,
â¢and in dread of , thÂ£f flaming sword,
Shmunke, "which "*Â¦ turned ' every way
to keep the way. of the tree of life."
I hurried to my Iqdgings. Entering
the'houee, I found my landlord, Menke,
st his working-table, with a disen
gaged needle in his hand, his spectacles
lowered almost to the very end of hia
nose, one leg thrown over the other
in reflective forgetfulness. His wife,
at his s!de, had the little finger of her
left hand between her lips, her right
hand supporting the elbow of the left.
and when I came In she moved slightly
forward and heaved a deep sigh.
My appearance evidently discon
certed them. After Menke swallowed
a lump and feigned a faint eoush, he
began to say something, but a glance
c-f his helpmeet silenced him, and with
out addressing any one .in particular
she said: **C5l ! oi! what have we come
to in theao days!" and her "Ol!" seemed
to find an echo in her husband's heart.
"Oi!" he also intoned, and then re
mained sitting and looking abstractly
with the disengaged needle in his htÂ»nd.
"He!" she proceeded dismally, sway
her heavily bewlgged head. "Who ever
heard of sudh satires (fatal daeie^s)
In former years? Who ever heard of
'Epicurean books'? Nu! hu! what an
age to live in! Would that my eyes
had not seen it! We tooli him (this to
her husband) into our home to be an
associate to Shmunke, who is tt bless
ing to- the town; and now at last Â«ven
Israel Teploffker falls Into Satan's
snares. Nu! what an age we live in!"
Menke was again about to say
something, but was silenced by an
other look from his spouse.
I came into my room. My trunk, or
rather the wooden box that served as
a trunk, was broken ope::, and all my
books and papers were gone. As I
etood gazing at my few pieces of un
derwear that had been thrown out of
the box and now lay scattered about
the room, Shmunke appeared.
"Epicurean, renegade, apostate, sln-^
ner in Israel." he accosted me in hia*
nasal voice, "you have polluted our
house with your unclean books..- The
Talmud in Sanhedrin -says: 'He who
reads sacrilegfous books will not enter
the kingdom of heaven.' I watched
you for a long while," he continued
zealously, swinging his long arms like
the revolving wings of a windmill, un
til, thar.k God! I could .Inform the.
authorities in the proper t time. Anti
you get out of this house this very,
minute." -
I listened to all this with a droop
ing head. When he had finished he
delivered the sentence I expected â I
must leave the Yeshiva at once. â¢
streamed down faster and faster.
"Even his own offspring, his sons and
daughters, turned their backs on the
faith of their noble father. The in
vention killed the inventor."
As his daughter set the meal before
me I placed my hands over my eyes, as
if from fatigue, and scrutinized her
through my fingers. Her face was de
cidedly handsome. Her nose, like her
father's, was of Russian type, and her
eyes were black and almond-shaped;
her lips were red and -slightly curled,
and her complexion was a warm, rosy
brown: and when she put the knife
and fork on the table I noticed that
her fingers were white and long.
Mr. Takiff looked up from his letter
long enough to glance at the table.
"Malke," he said to his daughter, "you
have* forgotten the salt. You are
dreamy of late, my child."
A faint blush passed over her face.
She smiled and murmured some ex
cuse, which afforded me a chance to
see her white teeth ard the little dim
ples in her cheeks. While I ate the
savory meal that the girl had placed
before me, the innkeeper smoked si
lently at his long pipe and observed
me thoughtfully.
"My brother-in-law writes me," he
began, after I had drawn away from
the table, "that you will be willing to
stay here and teach my daughter and
son Hebrew and the Prophets."
I corroborated Reb Dovldle's state
ment, and said that I would do my
best with his children if he saw fit to
employ me.
With that we went forthwith to busi
ness, and after we had agreed as to
the terms I was formally engaged as
instructor to the innkeeper's two chil
dren. Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦Â¦f, : -- --?;'/
He shook me by the hand ; warmly,
and settling himself in a chair oppo
site me began to read the letter I had
handed him Â¦Â»
"A kraskucha! a kraskucha!" the
crowd approved vociferously; and in
appreciation of the girl who proposed
the dance a peasant embraced her nr:d
kissed her on the mouth. Then came
the scraping of the violin, stamping of
feet. Jostling:, pushing, hugging, slap
ping, shouting,, whistling, laughing,
and the uproarious dance was on
again.
A few ' minutes of this sufficed for
me. I asked of the man who was
serving drinks for the master of the
house, Jjr.d was led across a narrow
passage- which separated the inn from
Mr. Taklffs living quarters into a
comfortably furnished sitting-room.
An elderly woman with a frank, genial
face greeted me.
"My husband will soon be at leisure,
and will be only too glad to see you."
she said after I had told her I had a
letter of introduction to him. "Per
haps you are hungry?" she immedi
ately added. And turning around, she
spoke to a dark-haired girl who sat
reading at the other end of the room.
"Malke, dear, show this young man
into the dining-room."
Very much pleased with this cordial
welcome I followed the young girl.
Soon the innkeeper appeared, slowly
puffing at a long-stemmed pipe.
Though at first sight he seemed to me
an old man, on account his round,
Kiay beard, he was no more than
forty-five. He was tall and strongly
built, and had a full. white face with a
small, thin nose (the Jews nose is not
as long as it is pictured) with brown
eyes that sparkled with â¢ youth. He
wore a velvet skull cap and a long
black frock.
dance)!" cried a robust muzhik beauty,
with a red and blue dotted kerchief
covering her sandy hair and with a
strand of green beads around her full
neck.
She was always frank and natural
with me: she treated me much as she
might have treated a brother of her
own age. She would pull my hair and
stroke rfty chin playfully, and she
f,ound great delight in teasing me. I
resented both her sisterly attitude and
the Jests at my expense. Frequently
her v.itty remarks made me writhe,
and I would decide that if she again
s-'poke In that way I would pay her
back In the same coin. But I never
did. In her, presence I was as submis
sive as a faithful dog.
But there were some happy moments
â when she would gaze dreamily at
me with those strange eyes of hers,
her hair falling loosely over her white
forehead, her breast quickly heaving.
I would beguile myself for a few
throbbing moments with the hope that
these looks betokened lqve for me. and
I would forget all eise. My ambition
to become a distinguished man. my
hopes to make a name for myself as
Katia wished me to doâ even thoughts
of Katia, who had aroused in me this
ambitionâ wculd quickly vanish, and
my only desire would be to stay in Du
brovka and give instructions to thla
country girl forever and ever.
Thf s e half Jealous, half arduous sen
timents finally got full posseassinn of
my heart and .brain. The lessons be-
Kan duly with the opening of a book,
but hardly ever proceeded further than
a few half-hearted questions and aim
less answers. Then wo would forget
the lesson and talk diajointedly or re
main silent, each engrc-ssed In secret
thoughts. Malke would sit looking out
of the window, her cheeks aglow with
a feeling for which I could see no
cause, and I â poor bundle of senti
ments â would interrupt this silence at
intervals only to t:.lk as none but lm
becllca and lovers can, -.while the slum
bering passions of a recluse stirred me
to a fury.
Malke's indifference to me, the more
I desired her friendshipâ her affections,

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
I had no difficulty in finding the
house of Mr. Taklff, for Reb Dovidle
had told me he was an Inn-keeper, and
that them .was but one inn in this
strangling village. The long corridor
which ran through the center of the
inn to the bar-room was crowded with
half-drunken peasants, who jostled me
as I picked my way through . them,
a,nd the bar-robm hasytwlth the smoke
of vile tobacco was also filled with
vodka-soaked 'muzhiks,; who laughed
and Jabbered and swore.
"Flay!" a drunken peasant roared at
a flaxen-haired lad who stood, in the
middle of the room tightening the keys
of a violin.
"Play. Vanka, play!'* several other
voices broke out impatiently at the
fiddler.

due to the Emperor's mother. True,
the Iron Chancellor was tottering to his
fall for other reasons, but when he
reached out his aging hand for a final
brace and expected to find it in the
English born Empress Frederick, she,
from a Victorian love of virtue," re
fused to be the imperial prop. Among
her motives was that Bismarck's son
was the intimate friend of her son, the
young Emperor, and the ladles of the
court considered as licentious in a way
they disliked this scion of the , great
diplomat, and so fearing the evil in
fluence of the association she was glad
to see father and son driven frQm

Indeed is Miss Anne Smith, the heiress

a close investigation of the relation of
women to-ihe evolution of the Cosmos
her singularity is altogether charming
by its odd contrariness; but when her
creator' makes the philanthropic Anne

professor, disguised for the nonce as
an iron molder and possessed of red
hair and weak eyes, the reader suffers
a distinct disappointment. Had Mrs.
Klngsley only allowed herself the boon

popular demand for a "love element"

T yOW royalty looks to the gossipy
t~i and evidently unloving- soul of a
lady holding the position of Dame
du Palais may be got at by skimming
the pages of two volumes, very much
scandal spiced, which , have been done
by Henry W. Fischer from the papers
and diaries of Ursula Countess von Ep
pinghoven, who was the said Dame du
Palais to the German Empress during
the decade 1888 to 1898. To say "to
skim" is better than to say "to read,"
for the reason that there is too much
of it and because there are places
where, when the mind becomes by re
peated experience prognostic of what
the woman is going to tell next, it is
more puritanical to skip the page and
try the Dame du Palais on another
story which seems leaa condemnable
and perilous with risk.
The criticisms of the Countess are,
in a way, clever, and some of her sal
lies are almost made brilliant by the
bitterness of that ten years' bondage
in the house she hated of the "all
highest," majestic, but, to her, Im
mensely little Hohehzollerns. Some of
the more Innocent of her stories nre
laughably amusing, and while we must
half suspect the scandal as being part

a large 'measure of general truth In
the revelations given . and the "proper
study of mankind being man," it may
aad to our stocl: of useful imowlou^e
to see how. very human even majesty
Is, and its hauteur but a mask to hide
! the same foibles which afflict the men
Qmd women of lesser light.
To the spirits of radical republican
ism and democracy, who condemn
all the assumptions of royalty and
imperialism as absurd and rapidly
sinking out* of date, this placing
in the pillory of William II, who
ic the most Imperatively dogmatic
presumer of the divine right of kings,
will be pleasing. To many more con
servative the show-up of his methods
of molding his people into submission
to militarism will make the war lord
almost seem silly; and granting that
William Is of much more real majesty
than this picture of him presents, yet
to patricians, real and pretended, every
where, even to the Kaiser himself, It
might be a half hour's amusing' to get
this glimpse of how one looks to one's
lackeys.
To be truly imperial one should have
either very true intuitions or else a
perspicacity extraordinary enough to
supply all the awarenesses which the
silence of intuition leaves lacking. Thus

George Gordon, Lord Byron, as a cen
tral figure. Truly she could desire for
a novel no more full-blown embodiment
of all that is romantic and bizarre in
the humdrum annals of life than this
enigmatic and erratic poet and poseur
of a past century. To add anything of
fantasy to the accepted biographies of
Lord Byron, even under the license of
llctlon, would be but to paint the lily.
Byron, the wailing Childe Harold of
the Alps, the impetuous Don Juan of
Albania, Is a figure startling enough
for any story teller's fancy.
The first impression one gains from
"The Castaway" Is that its author has
pictured Lord Byron as he thought
himself to beâ for Byron's conception
of himself was ever a ready mirror be
fore his eyes. Throughout the story
the young poet with the alabaster
brow and the flaring shirt collar is
quite the child of divine inspiration
and tragic sorrows that mourns his
fate from Alpine crag in "Childe Har-

wealthy, is struck with a bril
liant inspiration while listening to a
learned dlscueslon of the Otonologlcal
Club upon the uttÂ«r immobility of

things; she determines upon' becoming
a brute atom In the incarnate form of a
servant girl, thereby learning at first
hand the "why and the whlchness" of
all this high Ilown theorizing. So she
arrays herself In a $9 3Â» ready made
suit, writes her own recommendations
and hies forth to Join the great army
of master mechanics of the kitchen.
Annie Smith, the "J12 raw" kind of
st-rvant, furnishes to Anne Smith, the
sociological observer, enough material
for a year's course of lectures before
the Otonological Club. From Infinite
drudgery in the kitchen of Mrs. de Puy
ster-Jonesâcalled Jones almply on
wash daysâ the singular Anne drifts to
a delightful little dove cote of two new
ly wed, thence to the soapy-greasy
scullery of a fifth-rate boarding-house.
Her adventures in all of these places
are breezily refreshing in the telling.
But the Iron molder, WIHyum Brown,
spoils the latter half of the tale. Why
Anne Smith, who is twenty-seven and
practical to the limit of being "sin
gular," should stand in the rainy wet
and give over to strangely girlish
shivers of puppy-dog love passes com
prehension. When she reaches the high
ly dramatic determination to part with
all her wealth and follow only Willyum
the reader Is certain that Anne has
been reading Oulda with true servant
girl pertinacity. Miss Smith in love
ceases to be singular and with that
interesting; she is sadly commonplace.

Miss Elizabeth Robblns, whose por
trait Is presented on this page and
whose new novel. "The Magnetic
North," will be reviewed in these col
umns next Sunday, Is an actress of
note as well as a successful author.
For twenty years she has been on the

distinctive triumph in Ibsen roles.
"The Woman Wins." a collection of
the short stories . of Robert Barr that
have appeared in the- magazines from
time to time during the past six years,
brings together the author's scattered
tributes to the resourcefulness and the
lovableness of femininity, for in each
of the thirteen tales incorporated here
in a woman wins conclusively, without
reservation. Mr. Barrs short stories
come very near being models if it can
be said that in this difficult and little
essayed art there has been made suf
ficient advance by any one to 3et a
standard for Judgment. Above all
else his stories are notable for their
remarkable Invention; In none of them
is there a hackneyed theme or a shop
worn situation made over into- new
dress. Invention of the high order
that can unfold a unique situation and
utilize its every suggested feature
within the restricted compass of the
short story is Indicative of an ad
vanced art and is the sure prerequisite
of success in this difficult work. Of
the stories collected into the present
volume "On the Housetop." a singular
ly engaging tale of love in the face of
danger, serves best of any to illustrate
the distinctive merits of Barr's style.

"The Indians in Historic Times,"
as the title of this volume suggests,
begins with the etory of the red men
at the time of the Spaniard's first
coming to the West Indies. In geo
graphical scope it treats of the tribes
occupying North and Central America
and the Antilles. It is a (sufficient
guarantee of the unquestionable au
thoritative value of the volume to nnd
on the title page the names of Dr. Cyrus
Thomas and Professor W. J. McGce.
Thtre are particular features of Ir.terest
which render this work of unique
value â among others, the Inclusion
of the account of the Mexican and
Central American Indians and thtH of
the Indians of Canada. The study of
the Indians with reference to their
past, their easterns of government,
their tribal characteristics and their
arts and industries, has not until with
in a recent time received the attention
which the importance of the subject
demands. Tee presence of the red man
has been regarded rather In the light
of a verr irksome incumbrance than
as a motive for general historical in
terest. Yet. altogether apart from the
scientific Bide, the story of the Ameri
can aborigines has an Important bear-
Ing on almost every phase of American
history. If one would rightly appre
ciate and understand the course of
American history, one must know
something more than the mere rela
tions of the red men and the whites
'when in actual contact, either peaceful
or hostiles; their Influence on the his
tory of North America is by no means
confined to auch immediate relations.
The author in the present volume has
had this in view in dealing with the
jBubject. With the coming of the white
man began the struggle for mastery,
hence the narrative is necessarily a
relation of this struggle; but it is
much more than thisâ it is a history
of the Indians, their tribal organiza
tions, their habits and customs, their
Intertribal policies and enmities, their
relative stages of culture and their mi
gration, the effects of all which are
found in the America of to-day, and
all which have been considered in the
present volume in such proportions as
to afford a general exposition of critical
and precise value.
An ample narrative is given of the
conflicts of the pioneer Spaniards who
invaded the domain of the Indians in
Mexico, Florida and the South; of the
French and English in their respect
ive spheres of influence; of the end
less Intrigues between the Europeans
and the Indians in the course of the
long and bitter struggles for political
and commercial advantage on the part
of the rival European colonists and
settlers and of the red man's long
protracted contest with the settlers
and colonists. Indian diplomacy and
savagery in all their degrees of bar
barity are told in this volume, and the
various agreements ana concessions
that have gradually shorn the Indian
of his empire and placed him in a po
sition of guardianship. A valuable fea
ture !s that which treats of the Indian
ethnologicalljr, and of his influence on
civilization, as well as that which Bets
forth the policy of the United States
Government toward the Indigenous
population.
The author has furnished tables of
linguistic families, which, with the
maps prepared to be used with them,
will prove of great service to the read
er. In addition are a list of Indian
reservations and a chronological table,
both of which will be valuable to stu
dents and general readers alike.

MARGINAL NOTES
Upon Light Reading
With a summary of ail the efforts
bent toward the discovery of a north
west passage and of the consequent
discoveries in the Northwest by Van
couver and Cook, the authqr bring3 to
a close a work deserving of much com
mendation: Despite the scope of his
task. Dr. Brittain has written a history
which is, above all else, clear and suc
cinctâthat is high praise for any his
tory.

writer leaves the epoch of Spanish con
quest to review the tide of French ex
ploration which swept through the up
per half of the continent. The work
done by Verrazano in opening up the
whole north to French colonization is
outlined, both by extracts from the log
of the navigator and by the very cora :
prehensive summary of the author.
Follow, of course, the explorations of
Champlaln, of Joliet, Marquette and La

flicting claims of the French and Eng

subject the Iicht of maritime conditions
then existing, and the effect of rivalry

It Is to bÂ« noted that with all the

there is no breath against the Em

mainly a picture of jealousy and haut

of the Empress' mother's mental ab

every rÂ»art thereof from Darien

uf monumentai proportions and of
striking firnifirance in the world of
letters and of historical science alike.
This "The History of North America,"
projected and edited by Professor Guy
Carlcton L*-e of Johns Hopkins and
Columbian universities, aims to do. In
twenty octavo volumes, contributed by
a Ftaff of a* many well-known writers
Upun subject* of American history, and
arranged upon a plan commensurate
vith the wide scope of the subject, this
unique and comprehensive contribution
t<> the historical literature of America
will be concluded. Heretofore it has
been held rather as a matter of re
pr<^e<h acainÂ« the patriotism ar.d the
historical endeavor of our people that
there has ln-Â».n written no comprehen
sive inu connected review of the po
litical life of the North American con
tinent. No exeeiniun can be made to
the close and intensive 6tudies of spe
cial periods in American history that
have come from the jÂ»ens of Prescott
ar.d Pa.rk.man. Fiske. Adams and
Sthouler. Their works will doubtles3
remain standards for come time to
come. But a* continuous narrative of
the forces of civilization that have been
at work in the chief half of the New
"World for an unknown number of cen
turies, such as is this work of Lee and
his associates, must certainly fill a defi
nite lacking in our literature.
Doubtless an undertaking so cyclo
pedic will not win immediately the con
fidence of the historians. It will be said
that thÂ« whole cannot be a unified and
coherent work of art. that a collection
cf lndMdual monographs cannot reflect
anything; but a disjointed and sadly
inadequate view of the entire subject.
In a measure this probable criticism
has foundation. It cannot be expected
that the work cf twenty writers ana-
Ivxed by boards of advisers, pruned by
an editor and gathered into an ar
bitrary ech* me of coherence, will pos
sess the unbroken narrative force of
Gibbons* "Rome." What the work will
do, however, of which the first four
volumes no^ published give promise
for the whole finished series, is to pre
sent a complete historical conception of
the peoples of the North American con
tinent in definitive form. The four vol
umes already published are "Discovery
and Exploration," "Indians in the His
toric Times," "The Colonization of the
South" and "The Colonization of the
Mid#le States." We ehall confine this
revtew to a consideration of the first
two cf these, leaving the two remain
ing volumes for notice in a subsequent
issue.
To Dr. Alfred Brittaln, author of
* The Spanish* Conquest of Mexico."
"Octan Voyages in the Fifteenth Cen
tury" and "The Exploration of North
trn America," has fallen the task of
preparing the first volume of Lee's
â¢"North America," Commencing with a
consideration of the mythological dis
coveries of America by the Phoenicians,
i.h* <J reeks, the Norse and the Irish
from the eastern Eide and the fabled
voyages cf Mongolians from the far Pa
cific land*. Dr. Brittain follows the
authenticated records of the Colum
bian and post-Columbian exploiters
dewn to the laet voyage of Henry Hud
son, with a supplemental chapter upon
the cycle of exploration hinging upon
the search, for the northwest passage.
Departing somewhat from the accept
ed method of historical writing, the
author has Introduced wherever pos
sible original documents and ; tran
ccripts from first sources, sometimes in
their entirety. In narrating- the inci
dents surrounding the discoveries and
voyages of Columbus, he has repro
duced in full Las Casas' journal of the
admiral's voyages in which are set
down the daily log entriM. The letters
of Vespucci and the defense of Colum
bus' right -to honor for discovery writ
ten by Las Casas serve the author in
elucidating- the tangled controversy
settled about the head of the map
maker. Ajeln In the chapters devoted
to French exploration Dr. Brittaln has
punctuated his narrative with extracts
from Cartier, Jollet, Marquette and
La Salle's own accounts. In a work of
this nature, which does not aim at be
ing a minute study, but which is
forced by the scope of the subject Into
vtry broad and general lines, the apt
Incorporation of original sources into
the narrative such as the author of
the present volume has made makes
for a spirit of authenticity which
commands the confidence of the reader.
Quite the most Interesting- if not the
most valuable portion of the book Is
that dealing- -with ante-Columbian dis
coveries. Recognising the true point of
departure for an adequate survey of
the general movement of the restless
peregrination that characterized the
awakening from the Renaissance, Dr.
Brittaln has thrown his narrative back
to the beginnings of geographic sci
ence. He recalls the fact that the
Carthaginians ventured through ithe
Pillars of Hercules and down the West
African coast. That the Moors settled
the Azores centuries before Columbus
called the unknown eeas is established
by the remains of their architecture
found there; could the myth of the
seven wonderful cities of Clbola have
been founded upon the actual experi
ences of one of these Moorish sailors,
blown beyond the Azores to the Bra
zilian coast? The apocryphal legend
of a certain Irishman, Ari Marson of
Limerick, who found a "White Man's
Land" in the West, the story of the
Welsh Prince who discovered a fabled
new country, of the Venetian brothers
Vivaldo and their crossing of the At
lanticâthese are all interesting read
ing, though not worthy of a histori
an's credit, according to the writer.
Nor does he pin much faith on the
rlalm of Norse priority ia the discov
ery of America. "We may still retain
every whit of our admiration for the
unsurpassed achievement of the
Genoese." eays the author.
The chapters dealing with Spanish ex
plorations in Florida end Mexico and
the Eouthv.est denote an especially cer
tain grairp of the author upon this
phase of the subject. The obscure op
erations of Gord ilia's expedition to
North Carolina, of the ill-fated Narvaez
in the Southwest and De Ayllon along
the gulf are set forth clearly and con
cisely. With Cortex in Mexico and the

"Is it that you have grown fond of

half Jokingly, half in , surprise.
"J-J-Jordin, what do you make? Get
in the boat!'; '
"No," said the mate, "I'm going to
stop here until you send a schooner
for me.; It won't be very long... This
tub wouldn't' be safe with my extra
weight In her when, it breezes up this

that you're only making it worse?"
The banker said nothing.
"I say, do be reasonable; why do
you want to make it so hard-for us.
Celeste?", "cried the Baronet, with a
queer vibration in his voice.
"You ask me why I remain?' I tell
you. It Is because that if I go I am
the base lngrate. ' This man have

"Sall,O!"he v roared In a voleÂ© that
â¢ounded like a cry of pain. Suddenly
The busy little Jap, who had been
swabbing the boat dry. leaped to his
feet so quickly that he almost had a
capsize. *
- "E-e-.e-e-e â yah!" he squealed, point
ing seaward.
The mate's keen eye -was the first to
follow "the "boy's.
"This!" said the mate, in a deep
toned voice. He snapped a cord about
his neck and drew forth a heavy gold
en ring. The blue eyes of the Countess
opened wide.
"It was my mother's. Celeste. Will
you wcur it for me â always?"
She put her hand in his. "Yes

"Ah, yes; there is more. I have

many who have the wit, the resource,
the courage, the heart of gold. But
never have I known a -man who have
them all, as this gran" man; and he

her face with her hands-7-"mon coeur!"
She sobbed softly. -_ : Â¦.
"Ch; holl!" growled the banker; "let's
*o!"
"Who's going to chaperon you two
until the schooner comes?'"* asked the
Baronet jocosely. ,
"Is there any other reason, Celeste?"
he asked in a voice like the echo of the
surf. v~r
She raised her head, and the sunlight
shone on her face. The little hands
he 1 threw, nls hands above his head.
"They've come for us: The other
boat's been picked up! What?â what?"
He did a beach dance that would
shame a cannibal.
; The banker stared out to sea as If
uncertain of his part or me play.
Close to the shore the placid waters
lay pearly gray, still unawakened in
the shadow of the palms. Beyond, the
sparkling waves danced sun-kissed and
joyous with the life of the growing
day. Far on the low horizon a widen
ing band of ultramarine marked the
advent of the trade wind and over the
skyline a pink puff rose steadily over
the ocean's brim.
Larger it grew, coursing m the wake
of the breeze and soon the darker
speck that marked the hull appeared.
On she came, her topsail 8 hot with the
flaming crimson of the_ sunrise and
soon a snowy streak beneath her fore
foot showed each onward rush.
Close grouped, as if to concentrate
their sight, they feasted with their
eyes until the Countess's grew so dim
she could not see. A little sob strug
gled to escape, and at the eound the
mate and the banker turned to her.
The eyes of the two men mot to a look
different from that thrown seaward.
"Well," said the banker, "there's no
need for heroics after all. Veil all go
together, and let's try to forget this
chapter. I say we call everything that
has happened on this blooming Island
off. Celeste, don't cry. myâ"
The mate's arm encircled the Coun
tess. She turned to the banker.
"Ah. yes, mon cher! it snail bÂ» as
you wish. Everything is offâ but the
ring!" she added softly, turning to thÂ«
mate.
"Thought almost right," said the
mate: "might have been, bo far as you
r.ere concerned. Why didn't yo-u wait
for her?"
"I -don't know. I <1<>n't remember a
great dt-a! Â«>f what did happen. The
boat- was finking as it was â did sink.
In fact, before wo had taken a dozen
strokes." replied the Baronet, holding
the flask to the Countess's Hps.
"Is he dead'." she asked feebly.
"Nu. dearest; 1 am here, safe and
â¢ound." s-aid the banker soothingly, as
he chafed her hands.
"Oh, you! I do not mean you. I
mean that gran' man who plunged af
ter iiir as 1 struggle in the sea. You â
you s<t an' leave me to perish."
"You are unjust, doar. . I thought
that you werr in the boat."
"Ah. yesâ when I call to yo-u from
the vcfsVi. But I do not ask you thiÂ£;
I ask you if he live?"
"Yes\ Celeste, here he isâ and no:ie
the worse for his ducking," said the
Baronet.
"What happih>Â«Â«: Why I have the
fo great wish to sloep?" The long
Ia6h*^ drooped drowsily over the deep
violet eye*, and a penile little sigh was
lost in the soft breeze that fanned In
from the sra.
The matr, watchinrr her apathetical
ly, roused h'.msMf from his lethargy.
"Let her sleep right here where she
is. Give iii-Â» .your coat." The banker
slipped it eff and the mate folded it
and placed it under the Countess'
head. Khs rmiled drowsily and reached
out a fluttering little haita.Â»
"Ah! it is youâ my* preserverâ mon
cher ami!"
"There, there: you're all right now.
Take 0 Uttle nap: that's a good girl!"
He rose stiliiy to his feet and stretched
both great arms iibove h.ip head.
The Baronet looked at him quizzical
ly and smiled.
"Don't you think that you are r little
propriet.-iry In your manner, Knapp V
afked the banker in a voice.
The mate broucht down his arms,
threw out his chert and stared at him
a. moment. The drep lines on his face
threw darker shadows and the heavy
brow* came together.
;* Who's got a better right V he
growled.
"It seems to me that as I am her
fiance"
"You're a jlm dandy fiance. What
made you leave her on the yacht?"
"Oh. well, we won't argue that point.
But 'inasmuch as I am the owner and

schooner was your schooner nor the
mate your mate. But you've got no
schooner left, and therefore no mate.
Sawy?"
/'But your pay goes on just the
satne." said the banker.
"Ohj does It? Well, I'm no sea law
yer,-arid I don't know whether I'm en
titled to any more pay or not; but it
seems to me that I am entitled to some
salvage on this little craft that you
abandoned in a Finking condition," and
the mate Jerked his thumb at the
Countess.
"Oh, you do. eh? Well, you'd better
stick to your pay, youg man; it's more
negotiable."
The mate studied the Eand at his
feet thoughtfully. "Got anything . to
eat?" he asked, presently.
"One can of biscuits," said the Bar
onet; "and there's a spring back from
the beach a way."
"Good! That's worth more to us than
coinâ or countesses, Just now."
The mate took a survey of as much
of the island as he could see. Then his
Â«yes inventoried the ' fragments of
â¢wreckage along the beach.
"Uninhabited, of course. Wouldn't
support a jack rabbit so far as chow
goes. And Just about enough flotsam
to ferryone away!"
The Baronet nodded. â¢'What are the
chances of being t&kta off, Knapp?"
he acked.
"Dwa ellm. Accident*!, you might
found the Countess and the
male. She was lying on her side, with
one iirui half hidden in a tangled
ir.iiKg of hair that matched the sun
rise: the oiher was clinched in the
cold, Iron grasp of Jordan Knapp, the
mato-. \.-hose massive frame was
sprawled face downward, his forehead
resting on his other hand. Strewn
along the beach were fragments of
wreckage unu the stove-up whaleboat,
end all around was the soft, warm
desolation of a South Sea isle.
The Baronet carried a thin plank
â¢whittled shovelwise, the blade of
which was frayed and splintered from
contact with the hard packet sand.
The banker carried a large sailor's
bandani. caught up at the corners,
and bulging from the personal effects
that he had taken from, the drowned
sailors whom they had just interred.
When he saw the Countess a corner
of the kerchief slipped from his
fingers and the pitiful little trinkets
rolled unheeded across the shining
Eands.
Ti\oy tried to pry the mate's
6Liir^ned fingers from their grip, and
a.r they were doing so he suddenly
gaÂ«n#<-d and awoke.
The Baronet handed him a little
llask, and the banker took the wo
man by the shoulders and dragged
her above the high water mark.
Wlie-i he laid her down an eyelid flut
tered. The banker with a beating
l.eart lilled the hollow of his hands v
vith sea water. The mate, leaning
on his eibow. watched him sleepilyâ
anl divined his intention.
VGood Lord! she's had water enough;
try a little sunshine and whisky!"
"We thought, of course, you were
both drowned," murmured the Bar
onet.
WHE.V the quick rising tropic
sun hud cleft the velvet dark
ness into long, thin 'shadows,
the Baronet and the banker
say. Everything passing gives this is
land a wide berth on account of the
others on either side of us. New, if we
could manage to get to the next island
â but I don't quite see how we can."
He wandered off down the beach.
When he returned an hour later the
Countess and the banker had joined
the group around the fire. There were
dark shadows under the eyes of the
Countess, but her face was almost
childish in its animation.
â¢â¢Xevair have I taste' a dejeuner so
Rcod!" rhe cried as she set down the
shell which contained the last of her
"chowder." "All! here is rny preserver.
Ponjour, m'sieu. Before I am so fa
tiguee I cannot express my thanks."
She roso to her feet and dropped a.
courtesy, vhile the vivacity of her fea
tures softened for a:i instant. "And
what it is that you have in tha panu
ela?" She gathered her skirts in both
hands und thrust out her pretty head
inquisitively.
"Somciliing to bring back your
strength again, * Countess â fresh
laid from our farm," said the mate. He
sot down the bundle, out of which
roiled several largo, round eggs.
"R'svht you arc â turtles' eggs, by
Jove!" exclaimed the Baronet.
When the egga were cooked and eaten
a better feeling semed to pervade the
castaways. In their hunger none but
the economical Jap observed that the
mate ate but one egg.
The Countess dropped off into a doz-.
and the others soon followedâ all but
the mate, who arose and searched the
horizon with a cold, gray, anxious eye.
Soon he stol? away from the others and
ptowltii the beach, dragging fragments
of wreckage away from the reach of the
tide, searching shell heap and riffle for
objects rf use. His hard face lightened
as, wading wai.st deep, he dragged from
tho water the sail of one of the boats
and spread it out to dry. Three oars
and a bucki-t were the next treasures.
Later He almost howled with joy as
his eye fell upon a mass of cordage and
a hatch tarpaulin.
When all were sleeping the Countess
suddenly awoke, chilled to the bone
from contact with the cold sand which
the sun warmth had long since left.
The fire was almost dead and beside
the smoldering ashes lay Jordan
Knapp, face downward, and sleeping
heavily. His great shoulders were out
lined against the moonlit sky and as
\\% breathed deeply - and silently she
could see them rise and fall against the
white horizon. As she watched, too
c-old to move, a shudder' shook the
great frame; he turned partly on his
side and drew in his limbs to warm
his body.
Thn Countess crent softly out and
threw a few sticks on the fire. '' An she
slipped from beneath the r-dge of her
coverlet a dark object across it caught
her eye. It was the mate's cont and
another glance showed her fthat he
slept in his thin *-hirt. open at the neck.
She picked up the coat and held it
over the coals of the fire. When it
seemed that the heat had penetrated
every liber .she spread it gently across
the shoulders of the mate, noticed as
she did so" that the cotton shirt was
clammy from the dew. Almost as the
Kiirnient touched him the mate was
broad awake, up on one knee and tense
as a foreatay.
"Oh, it is you," he whispered, recog
nizing her in the moonlight. "I thought
that I v/a* in China again with Boles
and that the river piratesâ pshaw! I'm
half asleep still. What's the matter,
Countess?"
â¢"Dieti!" I have so cold I may not
eleep. Perhaps I have sleep enough in
the day. What a pity I arouse you,
cher ami! But you shiver in your
sleep and you have put your coat
across my knee," she added reproach
fully.
"I don't mind the cold," said the
mate almost roughly; "and I ought to
have kept the fire up, but I was sort of
sleepy, 1 guess." He was building the
feeble flames as he *8poke. "I'll make
you a comfortable bed to-morrow,
Countess, built ur> off the ground and
thatched out with palm leaves. Seems
like I might have thought of it before, Â«
but I was busy saving junk that we
may need."
"How long you think we must re
main on this islan'?" asked the Count
ess, holding her palms to the growing
blaze. :..:â¢, "Â¦â¢
"Not long, I reckon," he answered
reassuringly. "We'll start to knock
the pieces of the boat together to
morrow and then we'll work
our passage along this chain of isl
ands until we strike an inhabited one.
Maul can't be more than 300 miles to
the eastward'and the natives there are
friendly."
"But the boat â how without tools
may you make -him sea-deserving?"
"Seaworthy? Oh, there are nails in
the wreckaggjand I can chip these
shells into tools; and I have my
knife."
"It will be a task like 'The Tollers
of the Sea.' You have read that
book ?" *?.
"Yes; but there are several of uÂ«
and we have a sail and can wait for
a fair wind. It will be easy enough.
Don't worry. Countess, you'll be ; in
Frisco in a couple of . months." ;:")Â»**Â¦â¢
. "I do not worry when you are near,
J-Jordin Knapp," ehe added softly.
"That's a brave girl," said the mate,
patting her hand. "Now you must go
to sleep again."
The Countess made no reply, but
gazed out over the still, moonlit sea.
â¢ The banker awoke with a gasp.
"Are you' awake. Knapp?" he asked
querulously. "I'm as cold as death.
Can't you biuld up that flre?" .He
raised himself en his elbow and saw
the Countess.
"If you're going; to sit up by the
flre. Celeste, do you mind if â¢ I take
your piece of canvas? Who'd^ ever
think that It could be so cold down
h*Â»re in the- tropics?" he grumbled.
"You know my lungs aren't very
strong. Celeste, and the first thing you
know I'll be having pneumonia."
He tugged the scrap of sail partly oft
the Baronet. "I Bay, Knapp, just tuck
that thing around my feet, will you? I
believe I'm going to have a chill! Heat
up the rest of that chowder for me, Ce
leste. Damn the luck, anyway! You -
bet that the next time I hire any offi
cers for a yacht I'll get men with the
proper licenses, and who know' their ,
business. It's all your fault, Celeste.
If you'd only been content to go right
back this r.over would have happened.
Vv'hy don't you heat up something. Ce
leste?? Do you want me to h^ve a â "
"Shut up!" growled the mate.
"Eh! What's that?"
"Shut up. or I'll come over there and
twist year neck! Savvy?"
"What do you mean? Is that thÂ«
wayâ"
"Shut yer mouth, d'ye hear? The
Countess's got enough to bother hei
without your drool!"
The ba-nker glared across the firelit
space, then gTumbled off to sleep again.
The Countess gazed pensively at the
moon and then turned to the mate.
He rose suddenly, picked up the,
CountfiEs' poor little canvas coverlet
and held it to the blaze, then wrapped
it gently around her and drew her up
to him.
"Put your head on my lap â so. Now
turn your back to the lireâ so."
The lire was behind her, and tha
broad chest of the mate sheltered her,
from the night breeze.
"But you â Jordin Knapp' â you can
not sleeu t>o!"
' "Nefer fear, child; go to sleep." His
voice was kind but imperative.
"Ah, mon ami, nevair was I so com
fortable." She gave a little sigh, and
the eyelids fluttered down. The flames
grew brighter.
Soon she slept, and after a little the
roate'R chin sank on his chest and he,
too, slept. So until morning-, when
the Baronet a'woke.
He looked A them keenly in the
early dawn, .-nd .the smile that parted
his patrician lips was not altogether
ironical.
â¢A week passed and no, errant sail
clove the distant sky-line. The sup
ply of turtles' eggs was gone and the
fish caught by the Jap seemed a very
lonely member of his species. The
castaways ate^but twice a day, and
then scantily. .The lines under the-
Countess' eyc3 ' deepened, and new
ones appeared in the rugged facc<oÂ£.,

seemed to increase. With infinite toll '
lie chipped some of the broad sea
shell;; into the semblance of tools â '..
a saw, a chisel and an adze. Nails
were drawn or dug from box and
cask, the smashed ends of. the boat
neatly spliced and calked with cot
ton fibers.
Wlieh they awoke in the .morning
the artist was missing. ThcCountess
was the first to 7 find his writing In the
sand. .
"Dear friends," It read, "this Is to
apologize for leaving you so abruptly,
but I've lost my nerve. Knapp says
the boat can only safely carry four â
possibly five. The grub is getting low
and I'm sick of chowder; besides, my
demand is greater than my supply.
Love to all. May God bless you and
get you safely out of the mess! Au re- .

The next day the mate with a smile
nt the Countess, pronounced the boat \
to be "sea deserving." , Then * they
spent three days in catching 'fish,
which they dried In the sun. It was
easier to catch the fish, now that they
had a boat. Several bottles that had

The barricades bothered him, but he
mounted them all and began an emer

door was gently opened by a sad-eyed
man, who opend the ball by shoving
a rifle as big as a plnchbar under the
editorial nose. - 'Â»
At that moment the editor of the
local paper came around the depot
corner on the run. He was out foran
Interview, and, as usual, Just a trifle
late. However, he insisted on board
ing the baggage car to tender his sym
pathy to McWilliams.
Â¦"Not to-day," said Neighbor, grim
ly; "we haven't time."
Just then Sinkers rushed at the bag
gage car with a cup of hot coffee for
M.\ McWilliams. Everyoody, hoping
to get a peep 'at the capitalist, made
way. Sinkers climbed over the train
chests which were lashed to the plat
forms and pounded on the door. He
pounded hard, for he hoped and be
lieved that there was something In It
But he might have pounded till his
coffee froze for all the impression it
made on the sleepy McWilliams.
- "Hasn't the man trouble enough

sang out Felix Kennedy, and the laugh
so- discouraged Sinkers tnat he gave
over and sneaked away.
IT BELONGS to the Stories That
Never Were Told, this of the Mc-
Williarr.s Special. But It happened
years apo, and for that matter Mc-
WiUiams Ss dead. It wasn't grief that
killed him. either; though at one time
grief came uncommonly near killing,
us.
It is an odd sort of a yarn, too; be
cause osie part of it never got to head
quarters, and another part of it never
. got frcm headquarters.
How, for instance, the mysterious
car was ever etarted from Chicago on
such a delirious schedule, how many
men In the service know that even yet?
How. for another Instance, Sinclair
and Francis took the ratty old car reel-
Ing into Denver with the glass shriv
eled, the paint blistered, the hose
burned. and a tire sprung on one of the
Five-Nine's driversâ how many head
quarters slaves know that?
Our end of the story never went in
. at alL Never went In because It was
not deemed â well, essential to the get
ting up of the annual report We could
cave raised their hair; they could have
raised our salaries: but they didn't;
we didn't.
In telling this 6tory I would not be
misunderstood; ours is not the only,
line between Chicago and Denver;
there are others, I admit It But there !
Is only one line (all the same) that
could have taken the McWilllams Spe
cial, as Â«e did, out of Chicago at four
In the evening and put It In Denver
long before noon the next day.
A communication came from a great
LaSalle street banker to the president
of our road. Next the second vice pres
ident heard of it but In this way:
"Why have you turned down Peter
McWilliams' request for a special to
Denver this afternoon?" asked the pres
ident.
"He wants too much," came back
over the private wire. "We can't do it"
After satisfying himself on this point
the president called up LaSalle street
"Our folks cay, Mr. McWilllams, we
simply can't do it" â¢
"You must do It**
"When will the car be ready?"
"At 2 o'clock." â¢
"When must it be in Denver?"
"Ten o'clock to-morrow, morning."
The president nearly Jumped the wire.
"McWtlliams. you're -crazy. "What on
earth do you mean?"
The talk came back so elow that the
vires hardly caught It. There were oc
casional outbursts, such as "situation
is extremely critical,** "gTave danger.** Â¦
"acute distress," "must help me out."
But none of this would ever have
moved ths president bad not Peter Me-'
"Williams been a bigger man than most
corporations ; and a personal request
from Peter, if he stuck to it could
hardly be refused; and for this he roost
decidedly stuck. ."
"I tell you it will turn us upside

"Do you recollect" asked Peter Mc-
Williams, "when your infernal old pot
of a road was busted eight years age- -- 1
you were turned Inside . out then,
weren't you? And hung up to dry,
weren't you?"
The president* did recollect; he could
not decently help recollecting. And he
recollected how. about the same time,
Peter McWilliams had one week taken
up for him a matter cf two millions

carried It eighteen months without se

how it started. Not a word as to how

"We are, and right off. If there's
any of our huskies want to drop out
now's their. chance," said Pat Francis
as Sinclair slowed. up for his run.
Â¦ ' Ferguson called his men. The five
with their rifles came cautiously for
ward.
"Bridge burning!" he cried, looking
nervously forward.. "Well, that's a deal.
What are you going to do about.lt?"
"Run it. .Are you McWilllams?"
"McWilllams? I wish I was for Just
one minute. I'm one of hls^clerks."
."Where Is he?"
"I left him on LaSalle street yester
day afternoon."
"What's your name?"
"We might as well be starting, Pat"
suggested Jerry MacElroy, who depre
cated losing good time. "There'll be
plenty of time to talk after we get into
Denverâ or the Mattaback."
"Think quick, Pat." urged Sinclair;
his safety was popping murder.
"Back her *p, then, and let her go,"
cried Francis; "I'd just' as lief have
that baggage car at the bottom of the
river as on my hands any longer."
There was some sharp tooting, then
the McWilllams Special backed; backed
away across the meadow, I.aited and
screamed hard enough to wake the
dead, y.orgle was tr~" â r to warn the
section men. At that Instant the door
of the baggage car opened and a sharp

â¢JÂ£ridge burning ahead there."
"Holy smoke,!" mused Pat Francis,
who would have run the river without
any bridge at all If so ordered. "They
told us to deliver the goods, didn't
they?"
"Not if we can get across before the
bridge tumbles Into the river," re
turned Sinclair. *
"You don't mean to try it?"
"Would I? Wouldn't you? You know
the orders. The bridge is good for an
hour yet Pat, if you're game, I'll
run it"
Indeed, the 'firemanâ it was Jerry
MacElroyâ twisting and shifting be
tween the tender and the furnace,
looked for the . first time grave and
stole a questioning glance from the
steam gauge toward Georgie.
But yet he didn't expect to see the
boy, his face set ahead and down the
track, straighten so suddenly up, sink
in the lever and close at the Instant on
the ain Jerry felt her stumble under
bis feetâ caught up like a girl in a
skipping rope â and grabbing a brace
looked, like a wise stoker, for his an
swer out of the window. There far
ahead It rose in hot curling clouds of
smoke down among the alfalfa mead
ows and over the sweep of willows
along the Mattaback River. The Mat
taback bridge was on fire, with the
McWilllams Special on one side and
Denver on the other.
Jerry MacElroy yelled â the engineer
didn't even look around; only whistled
an. alarm back to Pat Francis, eased
her down the grade n bit, like a man
reflecting, and w*atched the smoke and
flames that rose to bar tne McWUIams
Special out of Denver.
The Five-Nine skimmed across the
meadows without a break, and pulled
up a hundred feet from the 'burning
bridge. It wts an old Howe truss, and
snapped like popcorn as the flames bit
into the rotten shed.
â¢ Pat Francis and his brakeman ran
forward. Across the river they could
see half a dozen section men chasing
wildly about throwing Impotent buck
ets, of water on the burning truss.
"We're up against it, Georgie!" cried
Francis.
To cov*r those sixty miles in better
than fifty minutes was like picking
them off the ponies; and the Five-Nine
breasted the Morgan divide, fretting
for more hills to climb.
The Five-Nineâ for that matter any
of the sky-scrapers are built to bal
ance ten or a dozen sleepers, and when
you run them light they have a fashion
of rooting their noses into the track.
A modest up-grade just about counters
this tendency; but on a slump and a
stiff clip and no tall to speak of. you
feel as If the drivers were going to
buck up on the ponies every once In a
while. However, they never do, and
Oeorgie whistled for ScarborÂ© Junction,
and 180 miles and two waters in 19S
minutes out of McCloud, and looking
happy cussed Mr. McWilllams a little
and gave her another hatful of steam.
It Is getting down a hill, like the
hills of the Mattaback Valley, at such
a pace, that pounds the track out of
shape. The Five-Nine lurched at the
curves like a mad woman shook free
with very fury, and if the baggage
car had not been fairly loaded down
with the grief of McWilllams it must
have Jumped the rails .a dozen times
In as many minutes.
Frcm McCloud to Ogalalla there
was a good bit of twisting and slew-
Ing; but looking east from Athens a
marble dropped between the rails
might roll clear into the Ogalalla
yards. It was a sixty-mile grade, the
ballast of slag and the sweetest
springiest bed under steel.
A roar went up. The little engineer
shook his cap, and with, a flirting,
snaking slide, the MoWilllams Special
draw slipping away between the shin
ing rails for the Rockies.
Just how MoWllllams felt we had
no means of knowing; but we knew
our hearts would not beat freely until
his Infernal special would slide safely
over the last of the 258 miles which lay
between the distressed man and his un
fortunate child.

"FlvÂ«-two-thirty-two," answered Sin
clair, leaning from the cab window.
"And we are ready."
"Then go," cried Pat Francis, rais
ing two fingers.
"Go!" echoed Blnolalr, and waved a
backward smile to the crowd, as the
pistons took the push 'and the escapes
wheexed.
The banker shook hands with each
one of the crew. "You've saved us,
boys. We needed It There's a mob

with the coin, all of you."
It was an uncommonly queer occa
sion, but an uncommonly enthuslastlo
one. Fifty policemen made the escort
and cleared the way for the trucks to
pull up across 'the sidewalk, so the
porters could lug the kegs of gold Into
the bank before the very eyes of the
rattled depositors. - V

Sinclair, MacElroy and Frauds, with
his brakeman, were surrounded by a
crowd of railroad men. As they stood
answering questions, a big, prosper
ous-looking banker, with* black rings
under his eyes, pushed In toward them,
accompanied by the lame fellow, who
had missed the chance of a lifetime
to die. rich, and by Ferguson, who had
told the story. . -. 0 .
While .the crew went up to register
two big four-horse trucks backed up- to
the baggage car, and in a minute a
dozen men were rolling spede-kegs
out of the door, which was smashed la.
as being quicker than to tear open the
barricades. .
"Mattaback bridge Is burned; had t*
crawl over on the stringers," answered
Sinclair, coughing up a cinder. --U
â¢â¢Where's McWilliams?"
"Back there sitting on his grief. X
reckon."
Sinclair, thinking he might never
gÂ«t â¢ another chance, was whistling
sharply for orders. Francis, breath
less with the news, ran fqrward.
"Coin? How much? Twelve hun
dred thousand. Whew!" cried Sin
clair. "Swing up, Pat. "We're off."
The Five-Nine gathered herself with
a spring. Even the engineer's heart
quailed as they got headway. He
knew his business, and he knew that If
only the rails hadn't bucked they were
perfectly safe, for the heavy truss
would stand a lot of burning before
giving way under a swiftly moving
train. Only, as they flew nearer, the
blase rolling up In dense volumes,
looked horribly threatening.
After all It was foolhardy, and he
felt it: but he was past the stopping
now. and he pulled the choker to the
limit. It seemed as If she never cov
ered steel so fast. Under the head she
now had- the cracking bridge was leu
than five hundred â four hundred
three hundred â two hundred feet, and
there was no longer time to think.
Witt a stare. Sinclair shut off. He
wanted to push or pull on the track.
The McWUllams Special was Just a
tremendous arrow shooting through a
truss of fire, and half a dozen speech
less men on either side of the rive?
waiting for the catastrophe.
Jerry MacElroy crouched low un
der the gauges. Sinclair Jumped from
his box and stood with a hand on the
throttle and a hand on the air. the
glass crashing around his bead like
hall. A blast of flery air and flying
cinders burned and choked him. The
engine, alive with danger, flew Ilka a
great monkey along the writhing steel.
So quick, eo black, so hot the blast,
and so terrific the leap, she struck her
nose lstp clean air before the men la
the cab could rise to It.
There was a heave In the middle
like the lurch of a sea-sick steamer,
and with It the Five-Nine got her
paws on cool iron and solid ground,
and the Mattaback and the blaze â all
except a dozen tongues which licked
the cab and the roof of the baggage
car a minute â were behind. Georgia
Sinclair, shaking the hot glass out of
his hair, looked ahead through his friz
zled eyelids and gave her a full head
for the western bluffs of the vallayt
then looked at his watch.
It was the hundred and ninetieth
mile-post Just at her nose, and the dial
read eight o'clock and fifty-five min
utes to a second. There was an hour
to the good and seventy-six miles and
a water to cover; but they were sev
enty-six of the prettiest miles under
ballast anywhere, and the Five-Nine
reeled them off like a cylinder press.
Seventy-nine minutes later Sinclair
whistled for the Denver yards.
There was a tremendous commotion
among the waiting engines. If there
was one there were fifty big locomo
tives . waiting to charivari' the' Me Wil
liams Special. The wires had told the
story In Denver long: before, and as
the Five-Nine sailed ponderously up
thÂ« gridiron every mogul, every con
solidated, every ten- wheeler, every hor.
every switch-bumper, every air-hose
screamed an uproarious welcome to
C irgie Sinclair and the Sky-scraper.
They had broken every record from
McCloud to Denver, and all knew It;
but as the McWUUams Special drew
swiftly past, every last man In the
yards stared at her cracked, peeled,
blistered, - haggard looks.
"What the deuce Have you bit Into?"
cried the depot-master, as the Five-
Nine swept splendidly up and stopped
with her battered eye hard on the depot
clock. ':-:";Â¦
And off went eyÂ«ry last man of the

THE short Bkirted girl of a year or

The short skirted girl of a. couple of
seasons past was the freak; she was
the Rainy Daisy, the pedestrian girl,
the mountain girl, the climbing girL
She was everything but the pretty girl.
For the short skirts, as they were
made then, were not pretty. They were
scant and ungraceful. They were too
tight around the hips and too narrow
and too flappy around the feet They
were made of coarse material. And
they were not elegant No matter what
they were called, whether thev were
named the ralnr day skirt or the in
step Ekirt, the shopping skirt or the
ankle length, they were not the thing
to invite admiration. Women wore
them because they were comfortable
and convenient But because they
were prettyâ never!
But now It is different The swing
clear eklrt no more resembles the Bhort
Ekirt of a few years ago than the dress
of to-day resembles the dress of the
tailor-made period. One was all se
verity. The other Is all grace. One*
made a woman angular and awkward
and masculine. The 'other adds a fem
inine touch to even the homeliest fig
ure. It takes away angles and makes a
woman graceful.
The Ekirts of this eeas<4i, those that
are made on the new art lines, all
swing clear. If they touch they are
of the round lengthâ that Is, the length
which Just touches the floor all the
way. round; the length that is so de
lightful for piazza, and house wear.
Dressmakers are classifying the new

numerous and so varied as to puzzle

nearly six inches apart. And. there is.,
no other trimming or decoration upon
the skirt It touches all the way

Is a subject which grows in proportion
to the interest in dress and never was
it of more concern than at this very
moment.
To fullv reall7~ this, and the reasons
thereof, take yourself back a few
months and Imagine thajt you are in,
the workshop of one of the best fash
ion designers in Paris. The . scene is
that of an artist's studio, and seated
In solemn conclave around the design
ing table are artists and dressmakers.
"Shall it be crinoline pr shall It not
be crinoline?" asks one of another.
It is debated at length and is finally*
decided in the negative. "Then all pet
ticoats must be very full," said the
leading man dressmaker, '"and they
must be built to make the gowns stand
out."
The other dressmakers took It up
and after long discussion agreed. Dress
skirts were to be made full, but were
not to be stiffened. But, in place of V
the crinoline, there were to be worn
the handsomest petticoats that could be
designed. They must be made out of.
pood materialâ that is, out of silk
which had some stiffening. And they
must be elaborately frilled Â»to make a
frou frou around the foot.
The echo of the conclave went around
the world and that Is the reason why
the petticoats of to-day are full and are
made as fluffy as possible. They must
make the gowns stand out. And the
dresses of 1830 and the dresses of 1860
that would be limp and incomplete
without these prettily elaborate un
derskirts are full and round and dressy
with them. -
The nicest petticoats are made with
fitted hips and are hooked, not tied, In '
the back. This gives a nice hip line.
The petticoat which is a swing clear !
.Is trimmed with silk ruffles around the i
foot and the edges of the ruffles are
pinked. Under each ruffle there is a
smaller ruffle to make it set out The
result is charmingly chic
The petticoats which one sees in the â¢
pictures, but which one never sees In <
real life, are now becomine possible j
for every woman. She need only
. fitted with a band, which is hooked
.around the waist, passing under a
in front to hold it down. The
whole i.-.2tter is very similar to the
dip frenÂ£ which has been the vogue for
a season or two. . . :â¢
â¢~ 'â¢ And there are still- other, clever de
.'vices.'. One of these is for making a
shirt waist Cip in front.. The waist
must be sewed to a', belt. The dress
"ckirt'ls hooked around the waist line
Â¦ and the shirt waist Is th*n put on. It
is pinned In the back and is pulled
down in the middle of the front. .This
requires a little skill, but the result; Is
' smart and many of the Newport girls
are catching on to its intricacies.
The girl who dances considerably has
few troubles this yeer. She has a
>klrt built for her special needs and
she Is rejoicing in it. It is short and
full and is one of the ncr tost and pret
tiest skirts of the season. It is built
either with or without the tunic, and It
Is made with ruffles and furbelows and
all the pretty modern trimmings of the
revived sKirt
Dancing skirts grow, shorter and
shorter, in fact.' one was sent to New
port last week which will not come be
low the- ankles of- the pretty dancer.
Its material. is. grenadine and Its color
an onion white. The figures are a soft
green and the trimmings are the color
of rose.
Onlqn white, by the way, is one of
the pretty tones. It Is, as its /name
(Implies, a greenish white, and it ' Is
dear:and pale and pretty and a color
that is immensely becoming in green
ish blondes.
Blondes, without tone in the skin
. can w.ear green and pink and one of
the handsomest gowns is a confection
in these colors. For the brunette the
tones must be a little deeper, and If
ehc be a very wise brunette she will
cling to white, for it will afford a bet
ter contrast to her Cuban beauty.
There are dancin/r skirts that look
almost like fancy' dre33. so very odd
are they, yet they are pretty. If you
go into: the nttic and get out a change
able silk and trim It with ruffles of
lace you will come very near having
one of these up-to-date dresses. And
~if, put away', you can find a pink silk
dress, all pompadour roses,, then you
will come mighty near having a gown
which will bear all the marks of the
newest dress of the season, providing
C you put a few touches'. on it, but do
not .alter its cut. The touches, are
sleeve touches, neck touches and hip
touches, for the hips must look slen
der. * - . ' '-'
â¢ - While one Is speaking of the short
skirted dancing girl, one must not for
get that this girl wears shoes and that
they are In evidence. And such pret
ty shoes at that. ,They come in all
' colors/' green 'and 'red, 'and 'they are
found. in tones that are almost pastel.
The rage for leather is great this,
season and, while the dancing girl is
buying her shoes she adds a few other
. leather ornaments to her costume. One
of her fads Is that of a suede belt
which she matches to her shoes. With
russet Bhoes of suede, built for danc
ing, she will wear a belt of russet, thin
and clasped with a big gold buckle

ties. One 'ot these Is the suede set.
which- is worn with nice- gowns and
with shirt waist suits. It consists of
several pieces and comes in a variety
of colors. It can â¢ be seen in cream
suede and in pale green and in a soft
â¢pretty -brown.- - -~
One of the handsomest of waist sets
was made of, thinnest suede. There
was a wide belt of gold brown fasten-
be shirred or. tucked as deep, as the
hips.' . But ' below that it hangs full
and plain until it is decorated around,
the foot with ruffles. â¢ Tlrere are three;
of them, atvd they are three fingers
deep.- â¢ At the head of each ruflle there
is v a rope shirring. '.i -' ;
. The best material for these Very full
skirts are the grenadines and voiles
end ' the of poplins and th*
sheerest of' mulls and lawns. Trutft
to tell they make a person look short
and fat, anti there is no living woman
who desires Â£uch a contingency.' -;>Â»v.
, But \vhere t!:ere is a will there is a>
way tnd the woman who wears j a
round skiit and who looks short and
stout in it. can lengthen her figure by
lengthening her belt line. '.- ~ â¢
' This is easily done. â¢ Put en. your
rourd skirt and hcok It around, your

low as possible and fasten it with a
short hat pin or with any kind of a
patent fastener you may happen to
â¢have handy.
It Is now time to put on your belt.
Throw It around your waist, pull it
low in front and fasten it with a fancy
'pin. This will give the long, full low
\vaist curve which you so much de
sire.
There Is a clever way ot accomplish
ing this same feat with a shirt wcist.
Put on the shirt waist and pull It low
in the middle of.^he front. Now put on
the. skirt and let it dip in front. The
front dip Is fashionable even with the
round skirt and many of the 1330 skirts
are cut with a very low point in front,
though perfectly round otherwise.
.The garnets true of the I860 skirts.
Though they are full and round, they
are, cut | with the dip In front. This
dip", which is made by scooping out the
front of the skirt in a big curve, is
j*;i<~v - Â¦ - ' --â¢â¢Â¦"Â¦Â¦.-Â¦ . ;
ed with a bis brass harness buckle.
Then there was a narrow turnover
stock of golden brown suede. Then
came leather bands for the wrists. A
set of this kind would be very smart
over a golf' suit and particulirly finÂ«Â»
over a. linen suit for any outing pur
pose, such as coaching or automobil
lng.
One might make thene sued? seta
with a piece of thin leather for ma
terial. There' is the longr. wid<\ soft
strip for the belt. It is not finished
upon either edge, but is plain anil
neat. Then there ai;e the suede bands
for the sleeves and the neck. These
can be worn over nice dre33es, for they
are very smart.
While speaking: of the fancies of the
summer girl, one must not forget to
mention the granny shawls which are
to be so much worn this season. They
come in every color and are made of
almost even'' material under the sun.
And th<-r can bi bought in knitted
goods, in cashmere ar.cl in ths heavier
shawl stuffs. There can also be ob
tained the granny shawl with the thin
stripe and the old-fashioned shawl
with the crepe stripe.
The typical granny shawl is perfect
ly square. It must be folded so that
the point comes down in the middle of
the back, and it is to be thrown around
the shoulders and fastened upon the
bust in the middle of the chest. It can
be secured with a big old-fashioned
cameo .pin, which is the smart fasten
ing for it.
Eut there are other ways to wear
the granny shawl and one of these is
folded long and thrown - around the
shoulders. This shawl hangs down in
front and passes under the arms in
stead of over them. Then there is the
granny shawl which is worn in Cuban
fashion, throws* around the head and
draped around land across the shoul
ders. Any woman who was a .bella
twenty years ago will tell you how to
do it.
And as for the shawls themselves.
What intricacies of knitting do they
show, what variety of pattern, what
wonders of silk and wool, all cunningly
intermingled. There are shawls knit
ted as fine as a web and in "the midst
of the . webbing there are marvelous
flowers all crocheted by hand, and
In many of the shawls there Is an ap
plique of roses and there are strips of
lace cunningly set.
But to turn from the other question
of dress to the one of shoes is not a
difficult matter, for shoes are conspicu
ous this year by reason of the short
skirts, and the woman of the season is
Indulging In a variety of shoes, one
pair for each costume. There are shoes
for every occasion, and each pair of
shoes seems prettier than the last. One
of the neatest pair of ties recently seen
was made In a golden brown shade.
with Cuban heels. These are a little
higher than the military and a little
lcwer than the Spanish. They are very
neat and display the instep charming
ly. Hosiery to exactly match the 3hoes
was worn, and there were stockings
with web so- filmy as to seem more like
lace than like stockings.
But the smartest thing of all is the
summer girl's pumps. These are cut on
precisely the same lines as a man's
dancing pumps.* They are cut very
low and are worn without string or
button. The feet are slipped into them
and the girl walks off.
The difficulty with this kind of shoe
is that it is very hard to keep on.
Since it Is not tied on and since it has
nq buttons, _li slips off the feet very
easily, and " the summer girl in her
walking pumps Is apt to step out of
them and walk away in her stocking
feet/ â¢ .} ;Â¦; :
But one must expect certain troubles
If one would be In the style, and the
fact that .the pumps come In tan leath
er/In Russia, In patent leather and in
all sorts of suede, glazed and unglazed.
shows that they will be popular the
coming summer. -.-. â¢
There is more and more of a ten
dency : to wear the very low tie and
the low shoe that is fastened with a
big buckle In the front. The colonial
slipper is well known and It Is re
vived this year and is worn with and
without the big 9 tongue. Then there
is 'the low tie with just three lace
holes instead 'of a dozen. There is
also the tie which is cut high in the
back and low in the front and which
is extremely smart for out-of-door
wear.
' For the house, as a dancing slipper,
a great variety of ties are worn. There
are ties with strappings across the
front and there are shoes that have
fancy fastenings of buckles and but
tons. There are oddities In Jet danc- -
ihÂ£ shoes and there are dainty, pretty
lUHe "things in satin with contrasting
buckles and bows. J , v
Taking it all in all. after a study of
the week's styles, one can safely affirm
three things. First, that the fashions
have changed wonderfully. This is a
fact which must be evident to the
casual observer. Second, that skirts
are more important than waists and
dominate the style of the dress more
completely.
In addition to the skirts there are
other things to be noted. Sleeves are
growing not only a little fuller, but
a little rtiffer. It Is almost as though
there were crinoline in the air, for one
of the new sleeves Is a leg o* mutton
with the leg part very full and almost
stiff. The fullness Is created by tha
cut of the material, but. all the same,
the effect is rather startling, for the
arm sets as though in a balloon*, with
the big part of the balloon directly at
the elbow. There is another new
sleeve and this Is made with three big
stiff folds of cloth. These folds are
sewed upon one edge, while the upper
edge sets out to make a nice full trim
ming.
There Is another thing to be noted.
and that la the prevalence of the ruf
fle. Skirts are ruffled with their own
goods and with lace, the lace ruffle
falling over the other ruffle.. Sleeves
are ruffled In the same manner, and
one sees ruffles of lace falling ovsr
ruffles of the goods, three or four al
ternate ruffles making tip the sum'uiiJ
substaance of the sleeves.
And there is another feature to bÂ«
noted, not strictly new, but" sufficiently
pronounced to be conspicuous, and this
is the fichu trimmings. Waists are
decorated with fichus of thin stuffs
bordered with a ruffle of lace. This is
tied around the shoulders ' in the
quaintest possible style. â¢ white the
front is fastened into a rosette, in the
middle of which i3 set a fancy :tona
or pin. - - *
But why try to tell all .the moves of
Dame Fashion? Sufficient to the week
are the novelties and more than suf
ficient unto the average purse iÂ» the
cost.

by the distinguished Englishman who,
after traveling in this country a # num
ber of years ago, went home and told
his friends that the American nation
was made up of 40,000,000 people, mostly
fools. But it is surprising how many
persons there are about us. Begin
to-morrow and make a tally of * the
ones whom you come across during
next * week and see how large a list
you" will have by Saturday night.
And yet I feel like entering a plea for
the crank and. the heretic, not for the
malicious, harmful-,, specimen of the
class, but for the man who has thought
himself out of , the 'beaten track, who
has come conscientiously to espouse
present the skirt is pleated and perfect
ly round. Devoid, by the wa;*, of trim
ming of any kind, vith the exception
of three or four tucks at the bottom
of a very, very short Ekirt. So short
are the Frsnch skirts, In fact, that the
knickerbockers are quite a consider
ation and must be trimmed and be ruf
fled.
The waist, nine times out of ten. Is
fitted over a low corset and is a shaped
affair, trimmed with stitched bands of
tv.-o or more colors and frequently
heavily embroidered with contrasting
milks. Her hair is becomingly and
properly dressed and it is really the
least of her troubles, for It never by
any unhappy chance is disarranged or
wet. and It rarely has the opportunity
to even be sun-kissed.
Caps are entirely unknown, besides
thty are homely as a rule, and it never
is the business of a born coquette to
appear at any time or place excepting
she 13 at her level best.
However, she doesn't . take any
chances for freckles on her nose and a
ekin that is brown and burned would
never, never do, bo ehe considers It her
bounden duty to purchase the niftiest,
fullest sunshades in the shops. They
serve admirably as hats when tilted
at the most becoming angles.
Certainly no one could expect her to
travel over the sand's from the bath-'
bouse to the water without' a -fluffy,
covering. So ml Iadi â¢ orders a military
cape that reaches the ground and' as
H is always of a delicate shade it
looks far more like an opera cloak
than anything else, though her bare
feet, peeping in and out, causes one
to stop and wonder for an eighth of
a 6econd. For a French woman, be
It known, never wears stockings when
In bathing. It's really too much of
a nuisance. Instead she sticks her
feet into white canvas sandals and
saunters slowly on her way followed
by a train of ardent admirers, who
carry everything from a camp chair
to a fan. for sitting idly in the sun
frequently causes mlludi not a little
exertion. ..
Fancy a girl who cared a flg for a
championship taking her daily plunge
In such a bathing suit. She doesn't
want certain rites performed and so
frequently steals into the surf when
half the summering world is still
asleep.
Her suit, by the way. is distinctly
characteristic and one that she has
evolved to suit herself. In the first
place, her first and chief requirement
Is that it shall be absolutely comfort
able and in order to be this it must
be of material that will retain little
or no water. At best, no fabric Is
sieve-like. Taffeta. China silk and
satin are. expensive at the beginning,
but if they .are' a good quality and are
well made and properly, cared for they
will easily stand the wear and tear of
several seasons. * -No suit will retain its
freshness and color* If it Is not nnsed
out in fresh water and hung in tha
shade to dry. The salt Invariably
gives a rusty tone and even the smart
est will look old early In" the season.
China silk Is soft and sheds the
water nicely, but it has one objection,
and If one has to economize. It is a
decidedly weighty ' one. Undergar
ments of the same color, most be worn,
so an additional mite is added to the
summer's expense.
The of wearing corsets and
girdles is one that each and every wo-,
man must settle fo-r' herself. Yet what
a bit of foolishness they are. *No mat
ter if they are loose, /there, is never
the same freedom and the same liberty
and the woman who expects to Â«eally
swim would about . as soon think of
having her skirt made with a train.
However, a rust proof girdle has
been Invented and, for that matter, an
astounding array of swimming clothes
that are warranted to prove most al
luring. ' Even though all these acces
sories are fashioned of net and feather
bone, every ounce counts and the addi
tional weight, if nothing else, makes
the ardent' swimmer hesitate.
. Of all suits the -red mohair are the
smartest, particularly when made with
a shirred or pleated' skirt. An especial
ly fit one has a full shirred skirt and
an" 'elastic' girdle, also shirred, which
gives a pretty outline to the figure. The
waist is simplicity itself. Bather round
in . the : throat , and Â¦ full as any baby
.waist" that \ ever > was fashioned. Even
the sleeves carry out the same shirred
effect and it la only a matter of cour
tesy that -dubs them sleeves at all, for
they are scarcely bigger than a minute.
Navy blue Is a popular color for suits
and one of the prettiest designs shows
a flock of gulls flying across the skirt
and waist. . And by ; the way, perhaps
you -. did , not ' know ' that , bathing suits
tire designed, especially If one is willing
to" pay- a couple of dollars extra. The
Â£-pÂ» HE crank and the heretlo are
I always emerging. Now and
I again they flash across the
X stage of action, and circum
stances give them national notoriety
for' a time. More often in the ebb and
flow of daily life we run up against

some unpopular Idea, who is dead set
upon some great reform and wonders
why the rest of us do not hurry up
and come to his point of view, who
really believes that he has gotten hold
of a new and satisfying truth or seen a
vision of what this world might ba if
only people thought as he did and were
ready to act with him.
In all such cases we ought tÂ» try to
get at the real center of tha man, to
find cut If ha has. despite, or It may bo
In some cases because of, his fads the
real root of the matter in hlta: that is,
is he, after all. a squar*. clean, kind,
earnest man? The other day a cousin
of mine returned from a distant State
to his former home. I had not seen him
for twenty years. I had a faint Idea
that he had been Imbibing some Ideas
not quite congenial to me, and when we
sat down by the fire one evening to
talk over the past, present and future
I soon discovered that he was a thor
ough-going Socialist. That he had come
honestly to such a position I could not
doubt, that he could champion It co
gentJy the course of the evening's dis
cussion proved. But what pleased mo
best was the man's courtesy, dignity
and unmistakable sincerity and good
ness.* I felt that, whatever his Intel
lectual convictions, he was rooted la
right living and that his heart was
overflowing with sympathy, with thÂ«
needs of his fellow men. As between
such a man and another whose ideas
are perfectly orthodox, but who cares
little for his fellow men, I am very sure
which I should choose as comrade and
ally.
But besides trying to appreciate the
fact that real goodness of life ls^not
dependent upon this or that theory, we
ought to be willing to examine the
ideas which our cranky and heretical
friends hold. For one, for Instance, to
undertake to combat the single tax the
ory without having read the classic on
the subject. Henry George's "Progress
and Poverty," would be as foolish as it
is to argue against Christianity without
having read the New Testament. It Is
well* to remember that frequently In
history the heresy of yesterday becomes
the orthodoxy of to-day. The world gets
on- In its thinking because every now
and then a Kepler, a Galileo, a Mar
coni, a Drummond/ a Briggs. a Lyman
Abbott dares to deviate from the ordi
nary highway, of thoughts to venture
Into unexplored regions, and to broach
theories not yet substantiated by fact.
Such men often are the pioneers of
great advance in the material, the In
tellectual, and the moral life of man
kind. We are all a good deal better
off â¢ with the right sort of cranks and
heretics than we should be without
them.
CRANKS AND HERETICS

the side Is apropos. Plain* with, per
haps, the exception of a Â¦ pretty silk
braid, a yoke of tucks and a few in
the skirt, < It is the simplest garment
imaginable. â¢ \Zi~f '*. 'Â¦', ;â¢
And * sweet simplicity, mind you, is
frequently far more trying than yards
and yards of frills and furbelows. The
suit that is badly cut may be made
presentable â¢ by trimmings and a few
adroit stitches here and there, but the
severe costume stands forth on Its
merits alone, and if it Is good it is
very, very good, and If It Is bad it is
horrid.
Occasionally one sees a swagger
white suit, embroidered in gay colors,
for the heavy Bulgarian embroidery or
the\ popular cross stitch is employed
and 'permits of two, three and some
times four brilliant colors. Generally
speaking, the trimming runs from the
collar to the belt and a narrow strip
finishes the sleeves, but it Is seldom
found In the skirt. " Instead of an em
broidered belt, a gayly colored braided
silk one is frequently chosen, for It Is
soft and pliable and makes a decidedly
Polka dot suits are fetching when
trimmed, with stitched bands of red
or blue, especially, if the waist does not
boast of- a sailor collar, as so many
of .them. do. Instead, a round yoke
with the body of the waist fulled on
and stitched is a pretty idea and a far
newer, one, though It, is much more
trying. than the square, collars, for if
one Is very slender It adds Us mite and
covers up a multitude of deficiencies.
For the girl who can wear It, a fitted
skirt is chic and neat. .Again It does
not. require nearly as much material
as the plaited ones and is,, as a conse
quence, much lighter in weight. It

to form a ' wide flare at the bottom.

mlladl fastidious Is to ring up the shop
and:, order the red, the' blue or the

much - for exclusiveness. Â¦
â¢ The girl who likes to' be seen gen
erally, selects a white, suit with a great
anchor in black for its sole decoration.
And right fit it " is, - too, when worn
with -black stockings,, white . sandals
and a: black and white silk checked
cap. .. Â¦'" -
Another swell suit is mads of white
mohair and trimmed with the popular
fleur de lis. All about the bottom of
the skirt they go and smaller ones
form -the trimming of the collar and
waist. .A black belt that buttons se
curely In place completes the outfit,
and really one would have to travel
many a weary block to see a prettier,
smarter beach costume.
OF all the numerous frills and
furbelows, the one that possesses
the most individuality and that
is thoroughly imbued with the
characteristics of the nation from which
It halls, the bathing suit stands first
and foremost. The picturesque cos
tumes worn by the peasants and the
garments that told the date by their
color, their cut and their make ara
passing rapidly away, but the bathing
suit with its irrepressible individuality
crcps up again and again and portrays
Instantly the race of both the maker
and tha wearer.
The American girl who dives Into
ind fairly revels in the water wants
something that is chic and serviceable
at the same time. Not so the French
lassie. She goes to the beach because
It is fashionable, and she dons a bath-
Ing suit because it is consistent and
because it reayy is vastly becoming..
In the first place, she knows quite
well that she need not consider the dur
ability of the material, for If shV
ehould get into thej surf to the depths
of her dainty ankles it would be en
tirely by mistake. .Â»
The French woman that swims Is. a
rare exception. Forsooth, the French
woman that goes In for any sort of
athletics is little short of a # wonder if
she possesses beauty and money, and a
positive freak if she was endowed with
a plain fae* and a flat pocket-book.
The fashionable woman needs an en
tire outfit; such a one. In fact, as would
drive the average American or German
girl to distraction. In the first place,
her suit frequently is made of some
daintily colored taffeta and.. just at
Red is a charming color for the girt
who can wear it prettily, but let her
think twice before^flnally choosing It,
for the glare of the water and the tan
that she so quickly acquires, when
combined with the rosy reflection from
the red make her look more llko a
lobster than anything else on earth. A
suit of red silk, fashioned to look Ilka
the Greek peplum, is one of the most
attractive shown. The trimming is of
white silk braid and of an old pattern.
The stockings are of red silk and the
mob cao\)f the same color, but It sits
at an angle that Is anything but Greek
in effect.
Shoes mean not a little to ths sum
mer girl and she has her choice of
three distinct and separate types. Soft
leather, in a dull gray, are good and as
the soles are perforated are light and
comfortable. Besides this, there are
the tan leather sandals that are essen
tially Roman. They really are not
meant for the water, but for beach
wear and so are not so serviceable as
the white canvas sandals that strap
about the limb and tie Just under the

But blossoms had been utilized In this way since
the year one and she refused to be so primitive.
She went to the country and helped herself
plentifully to rustic ideas. The flowers that she
had always considered merely ornamental were
not regarded Â«.< eminently useful. And. what was
more to the point, scandalously cheap and near
at hand.

up all idea of physical culture at an
early age and settle down to an unat

beauty is a fleeting possession, there
is a mellow type of comeliness which
comes only with years and dignity of

DINING-ROOM NOTES (Mrs. N. M.
REDUCING WEIGHT HEALTH
FULLY (Harriet).â A successful rer
duct ion of weight which came under
my observance was that of a noted
platform speaker. At forty years old
she was quite stout and her bulk great
ly interfered with her work. Being a
woman of determination she set about
getting rid of the burden and, at the
end of a month the scales showed a
reduction of four pounds, while at the
end of six months she had reduced her
weight twenty-five pounds. When tell
ing me of her success she remarked
that she had never felt better, and she
looked it. This Is the way It was done.
Rons, the warm, soapy face bath must
be used twice a day or the result will
be an accumulation of hideous black
heads. To determine the need of the
morning ablution, examine the face im
mediately upon rising. If a decidedly
oily deposit is noticed,* especially about
the nose and forehead, visibly to the
eye or readily felt with the' fingers,
use j warm water freely, following it
by a cold rinsing, for the accumulation
of waste matter thrown off during the
hours of sleep must be removed. Two
or three times during v the day,- when
the face looks oily, sponge or wipe it
with a piece of soft linen, wet with a
solution of alcohol and water, a most
excellent absorbent of fat and a good
tonic- if the alcohol is of the best quali
ty. Two parts of water to one part
of alcohol is the usual strength, ~ but
it must be weaker if the skin smarts
greatly after application. A. few drops
of one's favorite perfume may be add
ed if desired. .
G.).â Over -furnishing, like over-dress
ing, seems to have .become a mania
with many "American h'ousewives. The
woman who must depend upon ordi
nary servants soon finds her household
gods a nuisance instead of the Joy she
had planned, and energy and time is
spent in a ceaseless routine of clean
ing and rearrangement which might be
spent more profitably In rest or In
mental uplifting. If the multifarious
possessions seem essential, compromise
by putting them in the least trouble
some form. The modern dining-room,
with open 'cabinets and plate shelves
filled with china, is all very beautiful,
but a souice of slavery to mistress and
maids, so do not furnish your home la
this manner unless you are ,sutq of an
abundance of good help at all times.
Instead of exposing a mass of plates,
cups, etc., on open shelves, have only
such ornaments as can be well cared
for. Bear In mind that the silver and
the dishes In regular use means a good
deal of work, so do not add to the
worM of yourself or servant needlessly.
Invest in two or three china cabinets,
with artistically leaded glass doors,
and In them keep the dainty china, out
of the dust. This plan will save not
only time, but much breakage, and the
china will be ready for use at all times.
Furthermore, you cannot depend upon
using much of the shelf china, for a gap
is quickly seen, so that, after all, they
are merely decorations. The. rich col
ors of the wood and china should sup
ply the color scheme for your dining
room. .
tice the fastidious woman shudders at
the thought of the mussy thing, and
with good reason, for, as usually ap
plied, the mass eoon adheres to eyery'
thing except the right spot, and th*
annoyance and dampness do the
patient more harm than the poultice
does good. Try this plan and ydu will
vote It a success. Take thin chtese
cloth and make a bag long and wide
enough to cover the affected spot;
then make the poultice and pour it
into the bag, using a wide-neck tunnel
to avoid soiling the bag. Fold the
end of the bag over and sew with
coarse cotton thread; thl* will keep
the contents of the bag where il wilt
not bother the patient. Flatten the
poultice out by patting it between the
hands, lay next to the. skin and cover
with a wide band of flannel securely
pinned in place. If the patient is rest
less it is wise to pin the poultice bag
to the flannel band, then It cannot
possibly slip out of place. Be sure
to use only the best safety pins bo
there will be no Irritation from pin
points. These may seem trifling mat
ters, but they mean a good deal to a
sick person.
To assist In keeping the poultice
hot fill a small waterbag with hot
water and lay outside the flannel band.
When a continuous moist heat is de
sired for some hours fill two pr three
poultice bags and keep hot over a
kettle of boiling water. Keep plenty
of dry flannel bands handy, using a
fresh one as needed, for they assist
greatly In keeping both patient and
bed comfortable and dry.
When you feel that the lungs are
filled, gently and slowly 'exhale until
the lungs are empty. Then repeat the
exercise. Never practice directly after
& meal, but allow at least an hour and
a half to elapse.
EXERCISES IN DEEP BREATH
ING (Julia). â .To strengthen the
lungs, fi'.i out a Hat chest and to tone
up the whole system deep breathing is
â¢wonderfully effective. A woman finds
It very difficult to derive the full
benefits of deep breathing if the exer
cises .ire taken while fully dressed, al
though Bhe must do the best she can
when out in the open air. Spend a
quarter of an hour or longer each
morning and evening In a thoroughly
ventilated room, before an open win
dow, and if possible be dressed in a
gymnasium suit or a wrapper and go
through the simple exercises. Attired
as suggested, the entire thorax will ex
pand with each normal breath. The
muscles must never be forced by Jiaste
or hard exertion, for the pulmonary
tlesues are likely to be injured. Do
not be alarmed if you feel dizzy after,
a few trials of deep breathing, but as
eoon as the feeling is noticed rest un
til the sensation passes off, then begin
the exercises over again. Practice
only for a few minutes at a time at first
and at no time practice until you are
on the verge of breathless fatigue.
Stand erect, head and chest raised,
arms resting easily at the eides. then
eloxvly draw in a full, gentle inspira

Its contraction it presses down the
abdominal viscera immediately be
neath it and thereby enlarges the ca
pacity of the chest in that direction,
allowing the lungs to expand. At the
fame time the muscles of the ribs con
tract and draw them upward and out

downward by the diaphragm and
laterally by the "muscles of the ribs,
gives the Jungs room to stretch out

opened or over her shoulder, or even â¢ trailing
gently along her gown, the blossoms are always
evident and always from the desired -ontras;
â¢which Is her particular aim In life if she were but
honest enough to own It.
The smart little cane that the girl who affects
all things English switches about and taps her
friends playfully on the shoulder with no longer
boasts of a severe plainness. Instead of being
used for Itself alone it has been turned Into a
convenience and carries the glowing roses that
nearly every girl considers a part of her every
day outfit.
In every conceivable form, in all colors and in
all flowers from the gay and golden marigold with
all Its primness* to the demure sad-raced pansles;
from the vivid corn flowers to the characteristic
marguerites, each and every one. no matter how
ordinary and common It has heretofore been con
sidered, are to be found bravely doing their duty
and adding their mite cheerfully anil sweetly.
To be sure. It is not within the power of every
girl to pick and choose her daily decorations, n->r
can she always afford to buy them, but she may
at least have a generous supply laid away care
fully in her top drawer that will serve prettily
for ordinary occasions.
And she really need not feel so badly about It
either, for ribbon is used so extensively this sea
son, and in such a variety of colors, that she will
-find no great difficulty in copying any simple
flower. The most easily imitated, perhaps. Is the
rose, and it is fashioned in "this wise: Of course,
she selects her favorite color and %ha knows bet
ter than any one else what size she prefers, but
generally a number nine satin ribbon Is used and
she finds thÂ£ product fit for all purposes.
First of all the ribbon is cut into lengths of
three or four inches so that there may be some
slight variation In the size of the petals. These
piecesfare next doubled crosswise at half their
length and the corners of the folded edge are
rolled about three times to give the curled look
that the edge of a rose petal invariably has. Then
it is caught through on the wrong side of the rib
bon so that the stitches will not show, for much
depends upon neatness in flower making. After
this the cut edges are pleated together to make
the petal cup-shaped and the whole Is securely
newed together. The centers of the rose on the
green cups that seem to be the standing point of
the stems, and the foliage itself may be purchased
at any millinery shop, or, better still, at any house
that carries a line or that makes a specialty of
paper flowers. The stems may be carefully rolled
In a green paper or covered with a green rubber
tubing, as both serve nicely, though, of course,
the tubing is more durable, but much more ex
pensive, so far as that goes.
It is the wisest move to get a rose and try to
copy it exactly, for each and every one that
blooms has its own individuality and tries to be
as different from its neighbor as possible. As each
petal is made it should be sewed to the center and
each one should overlap the next ever so slightly.
One must judge about the size of the rose, as from
three to eight petals are sufficient, though, as a
rule, the fewer used the better the results, for
crowding them always gives the rose a most un
natural appearance.
Black flowers are striking and very, very use
ful as well, for they can bÂ« changed from one
gown to another and are slow In showing soil.
Black asters are about the easiest and the most
satisfactory ones to make, as well as being rather
Inexpensive. Half-inch black velvet ribbon is used
in the first place. Two pieces, each one inch longr
and pointed at either end. are laid across each
other and a bit of wire twisted about them to
form a item.
,Ten pieces
o f ribbon,
each an Inch
and a quar
ter long and
.pointed a t
one end ere

row. Each
row gets

as the flow
e r grows.
For in
stance, the
second row
was twenty bits, each ore and
three-quarters inches in !< *Â« h and
bo on. The 'stem is cov#fÂ» 1 with
the same green rubber tubing, and to
make an effective flower each one
should be furnished with a strip of
preen silk, cut into a pointed fringe.
Of course, different sized asters are
made to form a spray or even a
wreath, but thev are fashioned in ex
actly the same style only on a smaller
or a larger plan.
Asters, like the great sprawly crim
son poppies, are especially fit when
worn in th*e hair as "bobs." This re
quires low dressing, and. as a rule, a
simple braided effect. One. and some
times two, flov/ers are chosen and
fastened directly under the ears, so
that they nestle in the small of the
neck. If the poppies are chosen, the
shaded effect Is never neglected, for,
while one may be a beautiful pink,
the next but one will in all probability
be a gorgeous red, and when fastened
together their tints blend splendidly
and eive a charming effect.
Daisies are dalntr, useful blossoms,
and any one that is half way handy
with a needle can turn them out whole
sale and retail. A number Uto white
satin ribbon Is necessary and the trick
seems to be in one's ability to tie
knots at spaces of two and a half
inches. After that the ribbon is caught
together at even spaces between the
knots and the flower Is practically
finished, as daisy centers may be pur
chased br the bushel. However,
French knots of yellow embroidery silk
are a good substitute, and there is
scarcely a household that cannot rum
mage about and find plenty of silk
that will serve the purpose nicely.

FOR every wife who boards there
Is a husband who Is bored. For
every wife who does not know
how to make coffee there Is a
husband who forgets how to. make

had better "play at housekeeping" in

the blues coming over you at once,

build up a healthy body. The signs of
brain fag should be watched for and
the warning should be noted promptly.
If the child's head Is hot, if the ex
pression becomes one of anxious de
pression, if the forehead Is wrinkled
and the hands frequently put to the
head. If the sleep is disturbed and the
appetite Impaired there Is serious
trouble somewhere. It 'is the parents'
duty to pee where the trouble Is. On
the other hand, the parents must not be
too ready to permit the trouble to be
blamed on study. Probably not more
than one case out of twenty reported

much school work. Very frequently It
is lack ' of sleep, music lessons, parties
and other affairs which make it .Im

demands. . â¢ -
It will generally be found that the
doctors who complain most of the over
pressure of work In rchool â¢ are those
Who can give any good reason why
so many parents are anxious that their
children should be precocious? Precoc
ity means early ripening. The same
parents would have no use for prema
ture peaches. Why, then, should they
wish to have their children | develop
prematurely? Surely nothing but Ig
norance can account for each a sense
less desire. The present 'civilization
tends to hasten unduly the developing
human being. Much care must there
fore be taken by parents in this re
spect.
It Is a grand, good thing that very
few of those supposed to be precocious
are really so. Most parents are only
too willing to believe that their chil
dren are a little brighter than those of
their neighbors. This Is but natural.
None but the foolish, vain or Ignorant
would urge their children forward In
the hope that they might appear pre
cocious. History falls to furnish ex
amples of great men or great women
who were really precocious in youth.
On the contrary, the patient plodders
are the ones who generally win life's
victories. History Is full of examples
of great men who were considered far
below the average ability while In
school. What good reason, then, . is
there for parents Insisting upon their
children being hurried in their develop
ment? Why do we do that which will
result In so unduly awakening self-es
teem and self-assertion as to make the
poor victims almost unbearable? The
child's mind Is bound to be active. This
Is natural. The Injury comes from
overtaxing It with matters which are
beyond its comprehension or keeping it
under strain for too many hours. Â¦
! Great care should be taken that a
child's mind does not develop at the
expense of Its body. As has been said
before, the most important thing Is to
from the consideration of love of his
earthly parents to that of his heavenly
father.
As the children grow older It is not
expected that they will spend much of
their time In play. At this stage they
will need more attention from their
parents that the better training may
be. given. Many will longer remem
ber with great pleasure the sacred
songs sung at a certain hour each Sun
day. Certainly, but few parents are so
busy on Sunday thnt they cannot give
some time to the reading or teaching
of stories, nnd In other ways interest
their children.
So far nothing has been said about
attending services. Every young child
may find pleasure In attending Sunday
school. When old enough to taks In
terest In ond receive benefit from the
church services It Is well that chil
dren should get into the habit of at
tending these services. However, pa
rents should remember that It Is far
harder for the children to remain still
any length of time than for adults,
unless the services arc very Interest-
Ing. Parents, how do your children
look forward to Sunday? The true
answer to this question will determine
whether or not you have given the
subject the attention that Its Import
ance demands.
What about planting faith in chil
dren? You need not do It. It Is al
ready there. Children naturally have
faith In their parents. All, we need to
do is to show children \ why every
child should have faith In God. By
faith they may be taught the pro
foundest truths of the Bible. How
early the little ones may be taught
that God loves good children! How
happy they are to learn that their
good actions please not only their pa
rents, but their heavenly father as
well!
The training of a child's faith Is one
of our most Important duties. The
happiness and the usefulness of chil
dren will largely depend upon" their
faith. '
be different from other days. The
young children should have different
plaything?, different games, different
dolls and be dressed differently. Thus
the child may, quite easify. learn to
look forward with pleasure, rather
than with dread, to the coming of
Sunday. Some parents have found It
to be an excellent idea to keep certain
articles, candy and other special Sun
day features, in a special room, closet
or bureau drawer. As the child grows
older parents should aim to replace
these childish things by Bible pictures,
Sunday-school papers and other suit
able articles.
Again, some children will look for
ward to Punday because their parents
spend more time with them on that,
day. Others, because they are to have
a larger portion of cake. Others", be
cause of many other privileges whlc^.
the love of the parents has prompted.
Where this love of parents Is apparent
it Is very easy for the child to pass
What parent has not been troubled,
or evÂ«n driven to despair, to know what
to do with children on Sunday? Even If
It has been possible to get them to do
Just a* the parent would have them do.
It is hard to know what they should be
required to do. Any parent who has
sufficient brute force determination can
make children conform to certain def
inite rules, but Is that the right thing
to do? Certainly not. Of all days, this
is the day that we should strive to get
along by lovlns kindness.
Some parents make Sundays so un
pleasanf that the children dread^lts
approach. No child should be ex
pected to act as parents do on Sun
day. Yet, do not many parents think
that children should be amused on
Sunday with the same things that
amuse themselves? This day should
What has been said of the Impor
tance of selecting the right kind of
companions applies with equal force to
the selection of the right kind of books.
Too often parents have favorites
among their children. Sometimes It is
quite noticeable to others of the fam
ily, as we!l as to strangers. Under
such circumstances, there la almost
certain to be discord and continual jar
ring. Who has not known cases
where the evil effects or such favor
itism has borne bitter fruit during the
whole live* of parents and children?
Too much care cannot be taken by
parents to see that their decisions are
Impartial. No matter if one child is of
a more loving disposition and more
lovable than another, each must feel
that then? is an equally warm place In
the hearts and an eoually prominent
position In the affection of the parents.
As they grow older (hey will ever prize
and aim to retain that loving regard.
Should occasion come Jhey will rejoice
to turn once more to the parents for
that advice and sympathy which they
know awaits each one without favor,
but with affection.
â¢X "T O parent r.eed be reminded that
l\ I it is important that every child
I y learn to read. It is also im
\. portant that they develop a love
for reading. It is of far greater Im
portance that they develop a love for
the right kind of reading. The best
school* are opt only teaching how to
read, but also what to read. However,
the ;>a rents cannot throw off their re
sponsibility. That reading which weak
ens the intellect and debases the mor
als must be guarded against. That
which strengthens the mind, forms the
basis of knowledge and tends to raise
the moral tone must be furnished. The
desire for the right kind of reading is
acquired. It does nc-t come by in
stinct. It is therefore our duty to give
cartful consideration to the matter.
Children will like to read those books
which we teach them to like. If we
pay no attention to the matter they
will almost certainly learn to love those
books which they find others reading.
If such is the case, it is our fault, not
theirs. In selecting books we should
have a particular end In view. They
6hould either be selected for the moral
benefit, to add to their knowledge, or
to give pleasure. The best books com
bine these three ends. The book of
fairy tales has its place. So also the
book of fiction, such as may be fo-und
in the Sunday school libraries. More
Important than these for older chil
dren are books of travel, history and
biography.
It is not sufficient to keep bad books
away from children. The right kind of
books must be provided. Any librarian
will gladly give suggestions upon this
subject. In selecting books it is Im
portant that we do not fail to con
sider not merely the age, sex and
temperament of the child, but also th'e
time of year and the part of the coun
try in which the child lives and many
other similar matters. It Is also Im
portant that the parent should read
tome books with the child.

KEEPING BAD BOOKS
AWAY FROM CHILDREN
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALE.
THE COUPLE WHO BOARD

HER CHRISTIAN NAME
THE FINE ART OF KEEPING SWEET
TO keep sweet amid a hundred and
one distractions and irritations,
'not to go to pieces over trifles,
and when heavy loads and big
problems come still to be serene ; and
sunnyâ this Is the finest of fine arts.
Do we give half enough attention to
its cultivation? Don't we think that it
is a good deal more important to make
a lot of money, to get on in our profes
sion, to succeed in politics, to acquire
social position, to write a book? All
excellent things in their way, but to
accomplish them' at the" sacrifice of
one's sweetness - of spirit is, Â«Â¦ after all,
not the best thing ; In life. '
Really, now, how can any one do more
good than by keeping sweet? You don't
have to ; cross the ocean or walÂ£ until
next "week to_ begin.' .You* don't have* to
acquire a - college education first. Â¦ You
can start this morning to practice the
art. You are working in the midst of
people who constantly ruffle your tem
per? Well, then, if you' can keep sweet
you will be a marked man and a
mighty influential one, too, in that
office or In tliat factory. You, a father;
are rounding, the, corner at night after
an "exceptionally : aggravating day In
business, but there looms in sight your
homeâ a haven ' of ' refuge.* How are
you going to carry yourself for the next
twelve or fifteen hours there? You
may not carry home. much money In
yo # ur pocket, you may , be : dreading the
strain that awaits you . to-morrow with
the opening of a new business day, but
this much you can carry home-^a sweet
spirit. 1 ' You s can grit - your teeth s and

and ' decent , to v my ' own." Â¦ - c
Sweetness does not mean absence of
strength. It is out from the strong
maple' that the sugary sap trickles in
spring _ days. Indeed, sweetness Is a
component element of all strong na
tures. President Eliot of Harvard Unl
verallty is a ' shining example of this.
He has had more than his . ordinary
share "'of fighting to do. H.e has been
misunderstood and misrepresented, but
his- urbanity has been unfailing, his
plain and gentle way of stating '' unwel
come truths/ of championing unpopular
positions,, has had much to do with
converting people to his way of think
ing. S\yeetness of spirit does not mean
namby-pamby-ness; it is the velvet
glove under which' Is the Iron handT It
is a- kind of buffer which strong na
tures Interpose between themselves
and the hardness. Â»

It took Harper exactly a week to
pull himself together. Then he in-
RUgUruted retaliatory methods. The
iH'Oies <>l .she Methodist church were
to bftvo a lair for the purpose of lift
ing the mortgage from the church
property. Some time before Mrs. An
dcrefin had declared that the church
Fhotlld stand free of debt within h
jfcar and it was believed that this fair
would provide the last $200.
The day before the fair opened the
young men of Carson came out with
eniall badges bearing the letters G.
JS.i C, but the mystic import of these
diameters could not be learned. The
ot|ly information elicited was that
Frank Harper was its president, and
tleit Jt would make its object known
injsood time.
The fair was duly opened. Half a
1in7.n1 local celebrities made speeches
and two or three dozen married men
mide purchases from their wives and
daughters who were standing behind
the stalls. Then there seemed to come
a, iiilL It was Mrs. Anderson who
made, the discovery that there was
not 'an unmarried 'man in the room.
Every young girl in Carson was pres
ent, either as a saleswoman or visitor,
but there was not a bachelor In sight.
The married men turned to manfulljr
and bought what they could afford,
but by half past 9 most of the 'crowd
lwd (joac and the receipts counted up
$17 40.
Tim next morning various young
irehllemen solemnly expressed regret
that they had been, unable to attend
and promised to get around that
.evening if they could. Evidently they
found it difficult, for the second night
of the fair was even duller than the
first.' Many of the married men had
stayed at home, and in desperation
Mrs. Anderson commanded her hus
band to see if he could not find some
of the young men and induce them to
come over. It was not long before
Anderson was back, his face wreathed
In smiles.
v r."Most of the boys are In the vacant
store, next to the pestofflce." he re
pevtedj "They are having a meeting
of the G. S. Club to discuss certain
Important matters."
"Did you tell them to come over?"
she di-niantled.
â¢I did, but they declined the invl
tutiun."
â¢â¢Well," said Mrs. Anderson, with
a tightening of her lips that Ander
son knew full well, "1 am going over
Lhere tu tell the boys what I think of
tSier.i for breaking up my fair."
"I think," said Anderson, with a
gravity of tone, which his twinkling
eyes belied, "that thÂ«y would be very
Klud to see you. It is not in any sense
a secret society;"
Ten uunuies later she was being
welcomed by the G. S. C. with elab
orate courtesy.
"It is with especial pleasure," said
Prank Harper, in his capacity as
president, "that we welcome you to
our meeting. We feel that it is to
ye-u we owe our very existence."
"To me'."' said Mrs. Anderson help
lessly. "I'm sure I never heard of the
club until Just the other day."
"None the less," continued Harper,
while Jack Anderson tried to get as
far behind his pretty wife as he could,
that she might not see his tell-tale
face. "None the less, it is to you
that the honor of forming the club
really belongs.
"It was your Idea that the young
women of Carson should pledge each
other not to marry until the prospec
tive husband had a home and $5000
in the Jjank. While it is not probable
.that under such conditions many of
us can afford to marry before we are

foolishly until we have each saved
up by this means the 55000 and the

"But," interrupted Mrs. Anderson
half tearfully, "I want you to come
over to the fair and help make It a
success." 'â¢â¢-.-"
"Madam," declared the " president

Unable to restrain himself longer,
Jack Anderson interrupted the speeph
with a shout of laughter, in which
even his wife had to Join. She turned
to Harper.
"See Jiere, Frank Harper," she said
energetically, "you disband this club,
come over and make the fair a suc
cess and I'll Â¦ disband the Provident
Home Club to-morrow."
She was true to her word,- but more
than one pledge was broken that very
night Even Rose Wilder, who was
presiding at the. household table, held
out an attractive spread, saying,
"Don't you want to buy this, Frank?"
"What's the use?" he protested. "I
have no wife to give It to!"
Rose blushed very prettily. "You
might have ' the wife â If you bought
the quilt. I take back all I said, and
I'll take back the ring, If you will let
me."
That night on the way home Mrs.
Anderson was struck by an idea.
".'Get Something* was a funny name
for the title of that club."
"I think." said Anderson," "that the
'something* they were to get was to
get square."

Jimmie Spencerâ Henry Wal
t) cot's "long suit." x
4"^ There was a great bond of
friendship between the two; per
haps they followed in this the law that
opposite* attract each other. For Jim
mie Spencer was the reverse of Henry
Walcot in almost every particular.
Â¦Where Henry was tall and dark, Jim
mie was rather the medium height,
and so inclined to rotundity of figure
that his face, beaming always with
good humor, inevitably suggested to
an observer the qualifying adjective
C "Why "do I like Henry so well?" said
Jimmie one day. in reply to a question.
"Because he is such a JMly fellow and
knows how to keep his mouth shut.
Say, do you know," growing suddenly
enthusiastic, "Henry can speak Eng
lish, German and Spanish, but, by
Jove! he knows how to keep quiet in
about fourteen other languages, not
counting dialects and slang." V
"Why do I like Jimmie?" said Henry,
musingly. "Because he is a Jolly good
fellow and knows how to talk, I sup
pose." .
So they sat now in front of a cheer
ful fire 'In Walcot's rooms, smoking and
talking. Jimmie was chatting away as
usual, but there was something a bit
distraught in his manner which did not
escape the keen eye of his Wend. By
and by even Jimmie's fund of small
talk semed exhausted, and each sat
smoking and musing.
It was Henry who broke the sllenca.
"Sit up, Jimmie, and talk out Ilka
a' man" said he,. with a laugh, "lou

â¢'perhaps I do a. bit in that line now

assumption of great mystery, "and to

to tell me that you have gone and got
yourself engaged." .
"Now, how in thunder did you know

with one of his peculiar, almost inau
dible chuckles.
"But I never told you that 1 was even

could not have had any Idea of it.
"Now. Jimmie, my boy. do give ma

"So!" said Jimmie, "then maybe you
have used them far enough to -tell me

"I undoubtedly can," averred Henry,
solemnly. "Stunted as my powers of
observation may be. they have been,
sufficiently powerful to enable me to
declare that the young lady in question
is none other than Miss Preston."
This prescience was too much for
Jimmie. who simply stared open
mouthed at his chuckling tormentor. .
"That's the worst of you close
mouthed people," said he presently,
with an air of deep disgust "You rait
around and don't say a word and all
the while you are keeping close tab on
everything and everybody. Then when
a fellow comes around to tell you a
piece of important news, you take the
wind all out of his sails with your air
of world-wide knowledge and con
sciousness of his most intimate
thoughts. I must say that I think you
might have pretended ignorance. Now.

And Jimmie resolutely shut his mouth
and turned again to his cigar/.
"Now, Jimmie." said Walcot, with
dignity, "don't be any > more of a'

vexed at so much stupidity. "Her
cousin's eyes are blue. I'll be blessed
If you ever observe anything."
Jimmie himself was not observing
anything, but was sitting with hla gaze
fixed on the heart of the flames and his
mind lost in a happy reverie. He did
not see his companion look up with a
quick terror In his eyes and a face
drawn with emotion. Nor did he hear
a question addressed to him. Indeed,
Walcot's voice was very thick, and he
hardly knew himself whether he had
spoken the question aloud, or merely la
hls^angulsh voiced it to himself.
"Then you are engaged to Kate
Preston?" he finally managed to say.
loud enough to make his companion
hear.
"Certainly," said Jimmie In aston
ishment. "Who did you think I was
engaged to â certainly not to Annie
Preston ?"
VI didn't know," said Walcot
weakly.
"So your mind reading wasn't so
good, after all!" exclaimed Jimmie in
triumph. "Well, I must be goingâ so
long!"
"And he was gone.
For a long time Walcot sat*before
the fire, though his cigar went out
unnoticed and was not relit.
Then he slowly walked to his desk
and took out a letter, addressed in
his own firm handwriting. Opening
it he. stood la front of the fire and
read it through twice. H was a-pro

The letter fluttered first to the fire

"Did she tell you so?"
"Nope," said Jimmy cheerfully, "but
I can't see how it is that you haven't
fallen in love with her."
- "Maybe I was in love with another
woman," said Walcot slowly.
There was something in his tone that
made Jimmie look up quickly.
Walcot was gazing into the cheerful
fire and there was such a smile upon
his face as Jimmie had never seen. The
mercurial youngster was on his feet
In an Instant and rushed over to Wal
cot.
"By Jove, old chap, so you have
been Indulging in a love affair and
didn't even take me, your best friend,
into your confidence! I call that
shameful of you, but I am deuced
glad to know that you are In love,
after all. Take my word for it. old
chap, there's nothing like It In all tha
world."
"Easy, boy, easy," said Walcot, with
a Quiet smile that may have concealed
some embarrassment. "I haven't con
fessed to any love affair yet. And as
for confidences, remember that you
told me nothing Of yours until you
were actually engaged. Even good,
friends like you and mo don't talk over
such affairs. However, I may haveâ
I hope to haveâ some good news to tall

"How soon?'*
"Who can say?"
"Have- you proposed to hexf*
"No, but I Intend to do so."
"Good boy! Go In and win. If 70a

And Jimmie's Infectious laugh took all
sting away from the remark.

Jimmie broke It with:
"Did you ever notice the color of her
eyes, Henry?" " - *>-: >; ;_â¢Â¦Â¦.
"Yes," answered Henry, with an air
of amusement. "They are blua, aren't
they?"
"No, Indeed," said Jimmie somewhat
Indignantly. "They ara a wonderful
deep gray; almost Mack." -
"Is, that so?" was the somewhat In
different reply. "Then she 'has tha

know that she has wonderful, deep

was very soft.

. That Is the sort of swboy he Is. How
I used to hate him! If he has a proper
sort of father, then he goes to college.
He does not work; there Is no need for

ance of mine against him. I always
had to work a great deal, and very
little came of It. He . fools around

He Is the sort of man that can't do

head. That is all we hear about it.
It seems to be the towel that does It.
Maybe, If the towel is not quite up

drinking gallons of strong tea. The
tea and the towel combined are ir

popular novel has ever tried work

A heathen Turk may have it In his

the towel out of window and rubbed

strong, tea always gave me indigestion
and made me sleepy. Until I had got
over the effects of the tea. attempts at
study were useless. -But the thing that
still Irritates me most against the hero
of the popular novel is the ease with
which he learns a foreign language.
Were he a German waiter, a Swiss bar-
ber, or a Polish photographer. I would
not envy him. These sort of people do
not have to le?rn a language. My
Idea is that they boil down a dic
tionary and take two tablespoonfuls
each night before goicg to bed. By
the time the bottle is finished they havs
the language well Into their system.
But he is not. He Is Just an ordinary
Anglo-Saxon, and I don't believe In
him. I walk about for years with dic
tionaries in my pocket. Weird-looking
ladles and gentlemen gesticulate and
rave at me for months. I hide myself
in lonely places, repeating idioms to
myself out loud, in the hope that by
this means they will corns readily to
me If I ever want them, which I never
do. After all this, I don't seem to know
very much. This irritating ass, who
has never left his native suburb, sud
denly makes up his mind to travel on
the Continent. I find him In the next
chapter engaged In complicated psy
chological argument with French or
German savants. It appearsâ the au
thor had forgot to mention it beforeâ
that one summer a French, Â«r Ger
men. or Italian refugee, as the case
may happen to be. came to live In ths
hero's street; thus It Is that the hero
Is able to talk fluently In the native
language of that unhappy refugee. I
remember a melodrama visiting a
country town where I was staying.
The heroine and the child were
sleeping peacefully in the customary
attic. For some reason not quite clear
to me the villain had set flrÂ» to the
house. He had been complaining
through the three preceding acts of
the heroine's coldness; maybe It was
with some Idea of warning her. Escape

the lady hastily, wrapping the child in
a sheet, "that L was brought m a wire
walker." Without a moment's hesita
tion she opened the attlo window and
took the nearest telegTaph wire to the
opposite side of the street. In the same
way. apparently, the hero of the popu
lar novel, finding himself stranded In a
foreign land, suddenly recollects that
once upon a time he met a refugee,
and at once begins to talk. I have met
refugees myself; the only thing that
they have ever taught me Is not to

PARENTAL SCHOOLS
Copy of Paper Readby Katherine Heath Angelo Before the
California Club Civic Day Programme,
Indeterminate, and pupils should be
transferred to their former classrooms
only when the teacher feels assured
that no further offenses will be com
mitted. .
The New Haven school was organized
in 1871 and now has five classes; one
for truants and incorriglbles, three for
children who do not speak English
and one for all these classes. In 1899,
585 cases of truancy were reported and
17 boys from these classes were sent to
the reform school, there being no.par
ental boarding school. '
The cost of maintaining the truant
classrooms at Bay City is but $600 a
year, this being the salary of the prin
cipal of the building, . who acts as
teacher. . The City Superintendent re
ports that this class has had a strong
deterrent effect on truancy. The un
graded school at Detroit has done val
uable work in its time, but now the
wisdom of its very existence as an un
graded school has been called Into
question. A building was especially
erected for it and first occupied in 1890,
but this was abandoned, as there' was
but one school to serve an area of
thirty square miles and It was too re
mote to return truants to school the
same day they were reported. One
more central room is now maintained.
Nine policemen act as truant officers.
The truant school of Grand Rapids . is
In a fifteen-roomed grammar school
and is decidedly objectionableâ truants
and Incorriglbles are in classes together
and. there is no way of separating them
from the regular pupils. Teachers are
paid $600 a year and the average num
ber of pupils in the school is S3.
Philadelphia has the largest day tru
ant schools in America. The city has
been divided into thirty districts and
has twenty-eight attendance officers.
In 1902 1452 truants : were returned to
school.". There* are.;' five ungraded
schools, the "principals receiving $300 a
year and assistants each $600. -,,..-Â¦ ,
- An' appropriation of $37,500 was made
In 1903 j for the support of , these special
schools. ' . The management is in the
hands' of the Bureau of Compulsory
Education, whose chief Is urgent In his
appeals for a boarding school. .
For : - the most marked success of tho
boarding-school type we must look to
and boiler house, an Ice house, two cot
tages, farm house, hospital and super
intendent's home. The course of study
Is similar, to that of Boston, besides
sloyd and clay modeling.
About half of the boys are employed
in the boiler house, barn and laundry.
Others are engaged in gardening, rak
ing and clearing up, mowing the lawn
in summer and shoveling paths in win
ter. v.~.-r.r.
The average daily attendance in 1S93
was 171. The average time of deten
tion of each pupil was about twelve
months.
. The expenses , in .the same year were
$29,293, the average expense per week
per child being $3 25.
The experiments In the city of New
York do not seem to have been at
tended with the same degree of suc
cesa as in other cities. In 1900 the
thirty-one attendance offloers of New
York returned to school 7000 children,
4500 being picked up on the street.
New York has two boarding schools,
one In a four-story brick building and
the other is on a plat of 'fifteen acres
in a suburban district. These schools
are found inadequate to the care of the
number committed and a desire has
been expressed for accommodations
for three hundred boys. In the New
York school special attention is paid
to military drill and mtusia Superin
tendent Maxwell, in his report, says:
"Improvement In reading, writing and
arithmetic Invariably follows proficien
cy in military drill, manual exercise
and music. The very idea that he is
acquiring a knowledge and a power
which most boys do not possess . raises
him in his own respect. and makes him
desire the other accomplishments that
usually belong to a worthy member of
society."
This training Is certainly of greatest
value, for out of thirty-seven boys who
were sent back to the- public .school
from the truant school twenty-nine
kept the grade of excellent -for ten
weeks and only two were returned to
the school for. a second term. Â¦
Great car* is made in the commit
ment of boys. Out of 150 cases brought
up. only 30 commitments were made.
. in Indiana the State Truancy Board
states that 25.025 children.. in 1900-1901,
were brought into the school, at a cost
of $27,885.
' San Francisco, too, has tried its ex
periment In the establishment of a
Chicago, where the most effectual work
has been accomplished. This school
was opened in 1902. It is located in
one ofc,the suburbs, on a fifty-acre tract
of land, of. which thirty acres are cul
tivated \as a garden and twenty acres
are used as building sites and play
grounds.. A large reservoir for -water
supply has been built, which serves
as a skating pond in winter for the
boys and from which hundreds of tons
of ice are cut. The school Is organ
ized on the cottage plan, which, when
completed, will consist of eleven cot
tages.- ' â¢ , â¢
The number of employes last year
was 23. The number of boys received
during the year was 191. The Inmates
aro given, as nearly as possible, the
course of study of the Chicago schools,
besides manual training, domestic sci
ence, gardening, .laundry work, gym
nastics and military exercises. The re
ceipts in 1902 were:
First appropriation, 140,000; cash
from garden, $512; sale of clothing
to boys, $556; milk from cows, $600;
vegetables used In kitchen; $250;
provender fed to stock. $50; vegetables
stored for winter use, $332; second ap
propriation. $12,953. Total, $55,254. The
expenditure, was $53,549. ...
The average daily "attendance . belng ]
87 made the per capita cost of main
taining the school $8 84 per week. This
was considered, a high rate, but the
school -was equipped for the main
tenance of 200 boys, and under simi
lar circumstances the cost of maintain
ing each boy would be but $5 30.
No walls, bars or bolts . or any
other prison features are on the prem
ises. The boys know that It. Is useless
to attempt to. escape, for the truant
officers would immediately bring, them
back to the, school. -Most encouraging
reports are received, from paroled pu
pils, and no^account is given of where

The parental school of Boston Is
managed almost entirely by the Board

Board having jurisdiction only over the

school for the reformation of refrac
tory boys. In 1S72, through tho efforts
of Mr. Denman, two classes were form
ed in the basement of a church on
Washington street and nsarty 250 pu
pils were transferred to them during
the year. J Mr. Denman's term of of
fice expired and on account of imper
fect organization and supervision these
classes were a failure. Since then the
law has been revised and San Francis
co must In the near future waks up to
a realization of what her duty U to the
youth within her territory..
A campaign to awaken puMle Inter
est Is the first thins necessary and a
sentiment in favor of the movement
will surely be created when the peo
ple are made aware of the facts.
The one question of finance Is at the
bottom of most educational problems,
but this problem has been solved else
where, and will be here, as soon as the
solution is demanded by the people.
California should have' a State tru
ancy board. Our city Board of Educa
tion should be supplemented by a bu
reau of compulsory education, whose
executive officer should be the super
intendent of compulsory education.
Then we might hope to. have our city
properly districted and a sufficient
number of attendance officers appoint
ed.
When this much can be accomplished
then an ideal parental school, such as
Is the pride of Chicago to-day, win be
an assured fact for ten Tranclsco. Su
perintendent Langdon has this year in
cluded in his estimate for school ex
penses an appropriation for a special
class in San Francisco and this la a
step In the light direction, but wo have
seen that the experience of other cities
has shown that truants should be
placed in classes by themselves, and
that the only satisfactory solution of
the truant problem has been in the
Ideal parental boarding school and San
Francisco should be satisfied with noth
ing less than the best.. If the law as
It now. reads "is enforced It will be a
powerful child saving influence in our
community.
The number of casea brought before
tho 'Juvenile court would be lessened
and' no doubt the number committed
to th'e reform schools " would greatly
diminish. This la a step toward the
formation of character and habit.
which is much more economical and
desirable than to delay and make nec
essary the work of reformation.
IN view of the fact that our new
compulsory education law Is In ef
fect and that action has been
taken by the school authorities to
establish In San Francisco a spe
cial qlassrooxn for defective children,
which shall Include truants, it is op
portune that we should Inform our
selves upon what has been accom
plished In other cities for the care of
the habitual truant and that we
should perfectly understand the situa
tion in our own city and the great
principle for which the parental
tchool rhould stand. ' Â¦'â¢
It Is a well recognized fact that lg
rurance is one of the chief causes of
crime â ignorance of books and igno
rance of a trade.
. The four great cardinal institutions
of education are the family, the voca
tion, the state end the church.
The ideal parental school should
give to every boy that training In
cleanliness, care of the person and
clothing, respectful . treatment of
ciders and superiors, obedience to au
tliority. respect for truth and honesty,
Â¦which he should receive In the family.
It should give him a vocation by fur
nishing instruction in arts and trades
uiid pave the way for professions. It
should teach patriotism, supply mili
tary training and the 6tudy of mu
nicipal and self government to fit the
child to become a member of the
statÂ£. and it should supplement the
tvprk of the church by laying the
foundations of his moral character
and a sense of human duty.
It is safe to eay that our one great
'"cause of truancy is our plan of edu
cation. It falls to Interest, hold and
develop the child as It should, with
Us mechanical massing of children,
uniformity of curriculum and method.
Cur social life has undergone a thor
ough and radical change and our edu
cation must pass through an equally
complete transformation.
Our system In the past has tended
too much toward the making of
clerks, when what the world needs is
younjc men who have a practical
Knowledge of arts and crafts, one who
has been taught in a workshop to
.work out his constructive instincts.
Vhe school must- give to the rising
u-neration a knowledge that will fit
him for citizenship. If a school is to
make moral, law-abiding citizens of
boys It must teach them to do an honÂ»
ticipates in household duties. Thus
habits of industry and order are
formed, regard for the rights of others
is insisted upon and an opportunity Is
given in many Indirect ways for the
child to gain knowledge. In many
cases the truant who has had the good
fortune, it may be called, to be com
mitted to one of these schools has
much more interesting and instructive
training than the average public
school pupil, and it has been proven
without doubt that a radical transfor
mation has resulted In the lives of
hundreds of city boys who took their
first step in moral and physical de
struction when they became truants.
It has been demonstrated that it Is
easier to furnish an occasional farm
plat than to maintain reformatories
and prisons, and statistics show that
life in workshop, garden, field and
forest Is the life that appeals to the
average truant and that almost with
out exception he becomes an honored
member of society.
Now as to what* has actually
been done in the. Eastern cities.
The cities having only the ungraded
classes are New Haven, which main
tains five, Bay City, Detroit and Grand
Rapids, In Michigan, each maintaining
one; Albany and Binghamton, N. Y.,
each one; Cleveland, two; Alleghany,
one; Philadelphia, two, and Providence,
Rhode Island, seven. Â¦
Parental boarding schools have been
established in Chicago, Boston, Goshen,
Lawrence, North Cbelmsf ord, Spring
field, Walpole, "Worcester, Mass., and
In Buffalo, N. Y., New York City,
Rochester and Syracuse.
Some ' cities like Chicago 'â¢ and New
York City, Including Brooklyn. ' main
tain both types of truant schools. Some
of these cities have had an experience
of nine years in which many mistakes
as well as failures have been made.
We will first consider the day truant
schools. In most places I a policeman
acts as truant officer, which is & great
mistake, as it is most Important that
only men of education ' and training
and rare tact and Judgment should fill
so Important a position. *
In many places the. sentence is for a
certain term of weeks, when it is -far
better to have the period of detention
est day's work upon every working
day. In life almost every one has a
calling or occupation, something to do.
and until the school for the masses
has for Its chief aim the cultivation of
the instincts of construction and pro
duction, the education of the children
of the tollers, who comprise the
greater part of our population, will
be a failure.
The university should stand as an
open door to all who have the ambi
tion and capacity for higher learning,
but we must, not leave those who are
not prepared to receive : this higher
education In Idleness, to be a menace
to the state In after life.
Experience has shown that the
establishment of free schools is not
enough, but a law of compulsion has
been Inevitable.
Truancy and idleness have always
been problems which all educators
have had. to face, and ever since the
establishment in New York in 1805
of the first public schools authorities
have had before them the problem of
truancy. The first, truant law In the
United States was passed in Massa
chusetts in 1850 and the people of
California have the experience of
other States for over fifty years from
which to draw conclusions. Children
who have been guilty of no greater
sin than disliking the usual curriculum
of the school' have been confined in
prisoners, almshouses, reform schools
and asylums, and it Is fortunate for
the San Francisco truant that no such
experiments will have to be tried on
him since Eastern cities have demon
strated to the present generation tho
possibilities of the modern parental
school.
There are two types of truant or'
parental schools throughout the United
States. One Is the ungraded day
school and the other Is the parental
boarding school, by far the most suc
cessful being the latter. These institu
tions are conducted on the cottage
plan, where boys 'are grouped together
in families. The plan has been to de
velop an Institution that wllj surround
the inmates with an atmosphere that
will wean them away from baser ten
dencies.' to place them in an . ideal
home where they may learn by social'
converse more 'than from books. - In ;
these families of boys statements are
made, inquiries arise, topics are dis
cussed, individuals are unconsciously
led ' to state experiences and - miscon
ceptions are corrected. Each one par-

consents, your Majesty should marry her.
"These lines I address to your Majesty as
the Calif, whose sacred duty It Is to respect
the commandments of our religion, to protect
the weak and guard the virtue of our wives,
daughters and sisters from low designs."
That struck home. Abdul-Hamid, wild with
fury, had Chemseddln Bey arrested, ; but he
had to send the young girl home. Immedjately
after, she was married to protect hÂ«r from
further persecution on the part of the Sultan.
Her brother was kept a prisoner Â¦ two j years
and badly treated, but finally Abdul-Hamidâ
to get him out of the country â gave him a
foreign post. . ,-.-..
MAKES THEM GROW BEARDS.
One',, day the Sultan was moat attentive - to
a young Tsherkess girl.' His passionate court
ing seemed to make no Impression upon her
and he wanted to know the reason of her cool
ness. "I do not like, bearded men," was the
curt reply. The Sultan bit his lip. but said
r.othlng. -.A short 'while after this the Tsher
kees maiden married a beardless secretary of
the Privy Office. On the 'morning .after their
wedding' an. order was issued, to the effect
that all secretaries of that office must let their
beards grow. | The young wife was highly
amused at,this peculiar wedding present. from
her rejected Â¦ lover and on the! next opportunity
she said to the monarch with her sweetest
smile: "Thanks, your Majesty, Â¦ for your kind
Intention. Tour Majesty, has reconciled Â¦_Â¦ me
completely to. the beards of our men.' I think
his beard is exceedingly - becoming . to my hus-
found her to his taste and made advances to
her. The proud Tsherkess maiden, however,
thrust him back very energetically and made
complaints to her brother.
Chemseddin swallowed his anger _ for the
moment and asked some courtiers | In high
position to plead with Abdul-Hamid. They,
however, did not venture to mix in the affair.
At last he besought the famous Ghazl-Osman
Pasha, the hero of . Plevna, to advise him
what to do. The latter told him simply to
write to his Majesty and promised. In bis
character of court-marshal, to hand* in his
missive to the Sultan. _<;â¢. â¢*Â¦.**â¢>;
Chemseddin Bey, at present Embassador of
the Sublime Porte in Teheran, a descendant of
one of the most aristocratic families . of the
Caucasus, was at one time the .Sultan's secre
tary. He enjoyed general esteem and was
distinguished for his aristocratic, Independent
and noble character. He had "a' sister who
was strikingly beautiful, and was staying at
the imperial barcm as a guest. Abdul-Hamid

custom, had discovered Safi-IÂ£az and fallen in
love with her. He poured out his heart to the
Vallde-Sultana, described his sufferings and
swore he could not endure life without the
"divine" Safi-Naz. The Vallde-Sultana, who
was fond of her nephew, promised to help him
and one day she told the Sultan, Abdul-Aziz,
that Safl-Naz was dangerously ill. From time
to time she reported to him about the condi
tion of the slave, whom he had almoat forgot
ten, and finally she announced her death. It Is
possible the Padishah believed all this. , At
any rate he took no steps to examine the case.
and Abdul-IIamid married the charming slave.
This was not to be arranged otherwise. To
possess her without marriage, Abdul-Hamid
would have had to buy her from his uncle,
and -to make such a proposal to his Majesty
would have l>cÂ»-n an unheard of proceeding.
It goes without saying that this ! marriage re

VIENNA, June 16.â Princess Hairle
Eefcaiad. a born Turkish Princess,
daughter of the late Mahmoud Pasha
Ben-Ayad, recently addressed a crowd
Â«>d meeting of the Vienna Women's
Clubs and gave her auditors a glimpse
into the darkest corner of the Otto
man empireâ the hsrem. But it is
Â¦what che was not permitted to say.
rather than what she said, that con
cerns this article.
Driven cut by too much freedom of
epeerb about the Sultan from the
Turkish realm into Western civiliza-Â»
tion, the Princess is devoting herself
to a campaign against the ignorance
and barbarism prevailing in the do
minions cf Abdul Hamid. After lec
turing in some of the principal Euro
j/*an cities, the Princess has planned
;i vi^it to the United States, where she
hopes to enlist the aid of the progres
sive American woman in behalf of her
ignorant and oppressed Turkish sister.
Lecturing in Austria is not the
Kim pie matter that it is in America
or England. Before a public meeting
*a:i be called in Vienna the permis
sion of the police must first be ob
tained and the Chief of Police sends a
representative to the meeting, who oc
cupies a seat on the platform and has
the power to close the proceedings
immediately if anything is said or
done which is likely to be at all dis
pleasing to the authorities. In the
case of a prepared lecture a copy
must first be submitted to the police
for their approval and censorship.
Princess Hairie's lecture appears to
hive contained many things displeas
ing to the official mind and when she
received the copy back she found that
.onsiderable portions of it had been
completely cut out.
I have obtained from the Princess
the prohibited parts and they follow
in her own words. Why the Vienna
police should have been so sensitive
regarding the feelings of Abdul Hamid
ftl nd his court is somewhat difficult to
smagine. but it is easy enough to see
why Turkey is not a safe place for
the Princess, for this suppressed lec
ture is perhaps the most vivid picture
of the condition of Turkish women
that was ever given from an authori
tative source. Here is what the Aus
trian police wouldn't let her Highness
pays :
COMPELLED TO BE IGNORANT.
Tb* Islam, in its proper sense, affords to
the Turkish wife rights and privileges which
rolpht tatitfy the most fastidious European.
Hut the Government forces the Mussulman
won-an to pine away under the curse of utter
jpnoranc*. At Bchool, if the goes to school
et all, ehe only mechanically learns to read
the Koran. The Koran, however, being writ
ten in Arabic, ehe naturally cannot understand
a word cf it. 1 In . this way she does not
â¢>ven get to know her own religion â for the
Interest cf the state ordains that the Mussul
man woman be made acquainted mÂ«-ely with
fcer outward form, not with her true spirit.
For the tame reason, first her parents and
later her husband generally forbid the woman
all reading, even the reading of such nem-s
papere a* appear after having passed the cen
Â¦-Â¦'.-;Â¦ of the authorities.
I do not think I take too gloomy a view
when I lr.sist that the entire country of Turkey
fcf-earcely possesses 100 educated women, and
of these not one was brought up in a Turkish
school. AH had foreign teachers. But even
this does not suit the Sultan. Three years
ego h* published a law prohibiting Turkish
families from engaging foreign tutors or
Covernesses. Let me give a description of the
wrangeraent* for a Turkish engagement of
marriage.
The female relatives of the young man
wishing to marry look about for a maiden
for whom a husband is wanted. Once found.
thÂ» maiden is brought in. clothed in her most
gorgrous cttlrÂ«. end Is bidden to seat herself
on a chair in the middle of the room. The
visitors contemplate, belittle, disrobe her with
their piercing glances. The man haa expressed
a wish for a plump blonde with blue eyes.
This girl, however, is a brunette, thin and has
r>!Â»ck eyeÂ». What matter if she but finds
favor in the eyes of these relatives?
One of the visitors â the young man's mother,
if the be present â prcstes a klsa upon the fore
head cf the article, and the contract is made.
If the girl doe* not p)**se them they withdraw
without going through even the formality of
saying, '"Well, we shall see, we may call
again."
A TURKISH WEDDING.
When the Â«i;.y of the wedding has been fixed
en authorized person and two witnesses of
the euitor go to the residence of the maiden's
parents, where an attorney and two witnesses
of the olher oarty await them, and in the
presence cf the invited guests and relatives
the ceremony takes place.
The choscn one is placed in a room In which
besides htrself there are generally only- her
mot'ier, fistc-rs and near relatives. The door
is left ajar. The man who acts as the attor
r Â« f of the maiden then askc her In a loud
vo.ee from the next room whether he Is au
thorized by her to contract the marriage. It
often happens that the girl, gives no answer.
Thrre times her representative repeats his
fju^ntioii and it the martyr remains obdurately
Fiknt, her mother or some other relative, by
punching her, cuffing her and dragging her by
the hair, try to force hrr to answer. If elie
ftlll resists, cne of the women often Imitates
l>cr voice end answers for her. "Tes." After
thlf doubtful "yen* the marriage contract Is
finally rettled. The husband does not consider
liimfxir the companion, friend or protector of
his wife. He has the rightâ if eo it pleases
him, to put her out of doers the morning after
thr wedding.
It U net nfldom that a girl of 14 years
!k sacrifice 1 to a man of 70 years. For this
s-he hae one compensation! She is held up
a* a rplendld example to other women,
loaded on to despair, some women try to
intimidate their husbsnds by Â» every means
wftliln their reach, particularly when they are
more clever tlian the men. When the late
1 aavroyonl Pasha, former body-physician to
AImJuI Hamid. wished to leave his wife she
acquainted the Sulian with the fact that his
tbjttclun and cooQdant possessed notes, to
which h<> daily added observations mad* con
cerning his Majesty's sickness.. There wu a
searching of the house by the magistrates, the
papers r.rre seized, and the physician himself,
after thirty years of faithful service, fell Into
disgrace.
The wife of another of the Sultan's physi
cian*. Emln Pasha, who was suspected by his
wife of Infidelity, notified the Sultan that her
husband was involved in a conspiracy, against
the life of the Padishah. Emln Pasha was
Â¦cot into exile and to this very day his where
about? is unknown. /"
THE SURTAX'S ONE WIFE.
. According to law slavery no longer exists In
Turkey, but in reality it flourishes there, as
much as it ever did. without any authority
daring to interpose. And that Is not so sur
prialwg if one considers that the Sultan'a pal
aces are settlements of slaves. The Sultan's
wives are all slaves â all with the exception of
one legitimate wife â a wife who originally had
also been a tlave, but whom, however, he had
to many- This young girl, by name Safi-Naz,
Â¦was. like her two sisters, a slave of my father.
Mahmoud Pasha Ben-Ayad.
My father presented the late Sultan, Abdul-
Aziz, with Safi-Naz and one of her sisters,
Tildii. These human gifts were handed over
with romp and luxury, according to the wealth
of thÂ«- donor. Safl-Xaz and Tlldiz were dressed
in silk and brocade, their brows encircled by a
diadem. thÂ« stones of which shone and sparkled
in every color of the rainbow. Their ears, fin
gers and girdles were literally studded with
diamonds. Their beaming beauty harmonized
well with the dazzling splendor of the gems.
I think I may boldly assert that nowhere, ex
cept in the Orient, could such splendor be
irr.ajjincd.
The two young maidens were handed over
in roost ceremonious style by one of my fath
er's eunuchs under guidance of Guirdi Ahmed
Atrha, at the time a clerk at the notarial office
in Stambul. Abdul- Aziz was eo deeply affected
by the eight of the two beautiful slaves that
he directly inquired in what manner he might
return the compliment. He gave each servant
5O0 Turkish pounds, about $2200. and begged

. Stockwell is a well and honorably
known name hereabouts. It is a
name long identified â though Its own
er is yet hardly old enough to boast
of his years â with locafc theatricals.
Perhaps, the period of its largest re
nown was during the Stockwell Thea
ter times, when the comedian chris
tened and opened what is now known
as the Columbia Theater with an ex
cellent stock company. Some years
of success go to its credit in local his
tory. Touchstone, Â¦ of his personal
successes, is probably the veteran ac
tor's most honorably â¢ tilled part,
though he has assumed cleverly most
of the well known comedy roles. In
another genre his Marks in "Uncle
Tom's Cabin" - is famous throughout
thei play-going country.
Mr. .-â¢ Stock-well's adventures as a
manager ; were also pleasantly pros

as we all do. Perhaps, for example, the

I took a moment to laugh with and
at the eternally changeful feminine,
and then said: "You had Miss Loftus
with you then as Perpetua?"
"Yes, until she became ill," the
actor answered.
"Then Miss Laurel?"
"Then Miss Laurel â and what do you
think of her?"
"Is she as young as she looks?" I
asked first.
"Janey is just eighteen," her man
ager and friend replied. "She has
heen with me since she was thirteen,
doing page parts and such like. Miss
Loftus noticed her and took the child
to live with her. Then one day she
asked me why I did not give her a
parC So I gave her a small part in
this pieceâ the woman exile who
speaks in the church. She did those
three or four lines so well that Miss
Loftus suggested that she should un
derstudy her. I said 'go ahead,' and
they did. Miss Loftus taught her
something, Mr. Powell, our stage man
ager, showed her the 'business' of the
part, but it is mostly her own idea of
the part. A month afterward they ask
ed me to see her rehearse. I did, with
the result that when Miss Loftus fell
ill I had no hesitation in letting Janey
try the part.".
"Is she as beautiful off the stage as
on?" â I began.
"You shall Bee her," Mr. Sothern
settled it. He got up then, opened the
door and melodiously boomed out
"Jariey!"
And "Janey" came. You who have
seen "The Proud Prince" know that
pure and flower-like figure, lyrical /in
its grace* poetic in its every, sugges
tion. Like a lily she stood there, still
in the pearly gray and white of her
last scene: the delicate flame of her
hair still about her shoulders and
caressing the starry pallor of one of
the most beautiful faces I have ever
seen. I looked at her â and shuddered.
I was afraid to hear her speak, so more
than perfectly was the stage illusion
of her fulfilled, â a white and delicate
nymph, "whose lines are of Greece,
whose lips should part only to spout
Sapphics!
The voice of the . youngest leading
lady In America did rather bring one
down to Powell street again, for Miss
Laurel had a very matter of fact,

was Just debating whether the classic
Apollinarie or cold cream were the
fittest libation to pour at the feet of

wasn't any Falernian knocking around.
Her child-like, direct, "How d'ye do?"
with its little hoarseness saved me,
and I ventured to shake the muse's
outstretched hand. . ......
Mr. Sothern looked ; satisfied as he
left us then t to rehearse a scene that
had not quite pleased his artistic eye,
and Miss Laurel and I settled, to a
chat. Before the actor went, however,
he warned me that "Janey thinks." * -
Truth to tell I . didn't care . whether
"Janey" thought or not. What matter,
with a. pair of eyes â like the "moun

Â¥we minutes after the fall of the
< urtain on "The Proud Prince" I was
in Mr. Sothern's dressing-room. Five
stconds after we had shaken hands
v.c were in the thick of one of the thou
sand and one arguments that Mr. Me-
Carte's new play incites. The actor
was not prepared for "company." He
had doffed the medieval magnificence
of his last act and tumbled with hur
lied courtesy into a good American
dressing jrown. But "it mattered not,"
j>s Laura Jean would say. The gentle
Pot hern would look the poet behind a
butcher's apron.
"You do like our play," he said in
response to my greeting. I noted a
particularly "well" look about the
player. "I'm glad you like it. As well
as "If I Were King?' " he queried then.
"I'm not sure to-night," I hesitated.
"I think not on the whole. I "want to
sleÂ«p on the impression â it's so un
usual â "
"It strikes a deeper note," the actor
suggested.
"Surely.** I replied. "To-morrow I
may find"â and I tried then to tell
Mr. Sothern what of wonder and mys
tery I imagined there might be for me
in "The Proud Prince' when I could
pother together its rare and glowing
threadsâ and my "Five Wittes."
"Butâ"
"Whirti 'but'?" the actor smiled.
"The cross," I besrarv. "I don't see
why the fool should use the cross as
a carnal weapon in his battle with the
soldier? Now I know that that was
not done without very weighty consid
eration."
"Mr. McCarthy and I had that over,
and apain and again over," the actor
owned. "This is how it appears to us.
The -fool is still unregenerate. He sees
in the tress only a bludgeon with which
to defeat the soldier. The miraculous
quality of the deed comes in in the
weak fool being able to lift the cross â
that you will observe the monk before
staggers under."
"But I cannot see â in a miracle play
â why the miracle stops there? It
pecms to me that there is further op
portunity in the situation. Three
times, you remember, the fool has to
belabor the soldier with his sacred
weapon. That might be in actual fact,
but should it be so in a miracle play?
Why not use the cross a la Valentine
Â¦with Mephistopheles? McCarthy could
htr*>, it seems to me, have shown the
mystical power of the symbol upon
both the fool and the soldier. The fool
could raise the cross in his carnal
madness â but would it not be well to
suspend it miraculously in air, at once
dealing death to the blasphemer and
awakening new faith in the heart of
the fool?"
We had more of it, and in theway of
women ar.d actors retained each our
oivn beliefs.
Apropos of the discussion, Mr. Soth
ern fclyly launched the following story
at me:
"I have a very charming woman
friend on one of the New Orleans pa
pers, and after seeing our play she
wrote to me apropos of the love scene
00 the eteps of the altar. It seems that
her pastor had seen the play and decid
ed that the scene was impossible â well,
blasphemous. I wrote her, on thinking
it over, that the scene might offend
some sensibilities, and that I really
might place it on another part of the
stage. Then I received a telegram,
'Dcn't change ihe scene until you re
ceive letter.' The letter referred to
tame, and contained the news that an
other pastor and friend of my friend
had decided that for such a love scene
the altar was the only possible place!"
j "You are expecting a telegram from
me?" I laughed.
"Oh, no, only" â Sothern's eyes do
twinkle sometimes. That was one
time. "But Hiss Loftus and I had
great fun over it afterward. We got
up .1 set of telegrams, about twenty,
end sent. them off to my friend at the
rate of four a day. Like,. this: 'Am

"The i Proud Prince," perhaps the
most ' successful adventure of E. H.
Sothern, is in. its second week at the
Columbia Theater. The play has
aroused an extraordinary interest. Its
subject is so uncommon, its acting so
.-rare, its scenic setting of such. unusual
beauty, that no -one interested in the
drama should let It- go unseen. Mr.
Sothern as the proud Prince of Sicily
who is transformed into his own fool

admirably successful portrait to his

: "Du Barry," with Mrs. Leslie Carter
in the title role, is a sensational suc

production Is a. record one. and Mrs.
Carter's assumption of her tremend
ously exacting role is one of the events
of recent : stage portraiture. The sup
porting company is throughout suffi
cient; in the case of Mr. Stevenson as
Louis XV and Mr. Gollan as the vil

effective. The stage pictures alone are

With the popular "bad beginning. *
the new Tivoleans last week marched
to disaster with "Sergeant Kitty."
Not having heard the opera I can oniy
surmise the reasons for its failure.
Probably though, among them, impor
tantly are Miss Sefton'3 defections.
However, the production serves its
purpose as a "bad beginninc-" To
night's "Robin Hood" will probably
be the inevitable success.
Everything, at least, points that
way*. In Barron Berthald, who is to
sing the title role, the Tivoll has as
good a tenor as was ever spread on
comic opera. Edith Mason, who is
the soprano, is well remembered from
the Southwell opera days, and Kate
Condon is a contralto understood to
be after Jessie Bartlett Davis" own
art. One knows of old Mr. Steindorft'a
choruses, and they were never better
than now, and the orchestra is well
up to the Tivoli levels.
The opera Itself 13 too well known
here to need comment, but It is worthy
of record that this is the first time
that it has been presented by any com
pany save the Bostonians.
A curious courtesy in church choir
relations â curious in contrast with the
general condescension accorded church
singers here (beginning not unimport
antly with the meagerest of salaries) â
is that instanced by a programme oÂ£
the "Washington-avenue Baptist Church
of New York. A new choir was en
gaged a few weeks at this church.
The regular church programme an
nounced the fact, printing not only the
names but a short sketch of each of
the singers, with an evident pride in
their acquisition. The chief interest of
the programme, however, lies in the
fact that the name of W. H. Keith, a
former Californian, appears thereon as
the barytone. The name is one well
known to old Californians, W. H.
Keith, senior, having started the first
drug store in San Francisco.
The programme has this concerning
Mr. Keith:
"William H. Keith (barytone) went
to Paris and prepared himself for oper
atic work under Sbriglia and Giraudet
of the Paris Conservatoire, also with
Bouhy. Later in London he studied
oratorio music with Randegser and
"Walker. He has sung in oratorio ami
concert work, in London^ Edinburgh,
Paris, Berlin and other Continental
cities. Since returning to this country
he has been engaged In concert and
church work in various parts of the
States. He enjoys an enviable reputa
tion both In Europe and America."
In the "please-publish-the-followlng"
stuff of the week comes to me the fol
lowing naive note of a forthcoming
Creatore tour. "California," it begins,
"and the entire "Western country will,
during the coming season, SEE Cre
atore and HEAR his excellent band."
It Is only the truth of this that sur
prises. Certainly one cannot escape

The most vitally interesting event of
the whole week was the departure,
amid pyrotechnical displays of friend

the stunning Mrs. Peter D. Just to
know the appraisement she has made
of San Francisco and. its smart set
embracing, of course, the suburbs, Bur

was small wonder that Peter lost his

wedded â no guests, no Lohengrins, no
galaxy of bridesmaids. But sometimes
even brides' plans go a-glimmering â
for behold the bride entering the
church to hear the organ peal forth its
processional and to lind herself in the
hands of a bevy of merry friends who
had entered into a conspiracy against
her and constituted^ themselves her
bridesmaids. Right pretty maids they
were, too, in dainty frocks and picture
hats. What was the poor little bride
to do but permit them to proceed with
her to the altar? A merry party it
was that left the church after the ven
erable -Dr. Wakefield and the Rev.
Mr. Cresham had made the twain one,
the bridal pair escaping with bril
liant success in a convenient auto.
â¢It is not only because of her beauty
that the American maid is a winner,"
says Grand Duke Boris, "but because
cf her poise. Ah: "Tis her exquisite
poise that distinguishes her from her
fellows." Now the opinion of Duke
Boris is entitled to respect, for was it
not because of his industrious amours
that the Great White Czar ordered him
home from the -wars? And was it not
he who reviewed the women of each
country as he passed through it on his
world's tour, even as the hero of Ap
pumattox reviewed the soldiers of
strange lands? And was it not he,
when pausing for a breath in San
Francisco, Â¦who pronounced Mrs. Post
ley Sterling the most beautiful woman
h<? had ever looked upon?
Granted then that the Duke knows
a thing: or two about women and that
his knowledge has been gained through
comparative â would you say anatomy,
or spirituality, or mentality, or would
all three make adequate meaning? Of
course, not having the pleasure of the
Duke's acquaintance, I know not the
focus of his vision. But at all events,
a pity 'tis that so rare a connoisseur
"f "my lady fair" was permitted so
brief a view of the women of the Gold
en Gate. And more particularly is the
fact lamentable, since he bo ardently
dwells upon the charms of "poise."
Xow. in all our great country where
freedom of thought and speech has
developed frankness of character in
women even as in men, it has remained
for the big bounding West to impart to
its women the highest type of candor
and freedom of thought, blasting
Fhams and senseless traditions of mi
asmic maidenhood and clearing the
ground for the sweet-breathed blos-
Foms of mental and moral honesty â
end herein is the root of "poise,"
springing psychologically from healthy,
wholesale, frank minds. And the rea
son that the American maid's "poise"
sÂ«.f charmed the Prince is because of
this very fact. In Russia, in France, in
Germany, not quite as much, perhaps,
in England, the well bred maid is ex
pected to present to the world Just
one phase of her being â the smiling,
amiable, so-called "sweet" side, elim
inating all suggestion of personality
or human temperament, which, accord
ing to the old code, a maiden should
not possess. And let the gods be
thanked for the evolution of the Amer
ican girl with her honest heart and
clear vision, which have endowed her
Â¦with that rarest and most comfortable
Â«'f social attributes â poise.
Among the maids of our Western
shores who would have interested the
wandering: Russian on this score are
Ethel Hager. Pearl Landers, Helen de
Young. Charlotte Russell, Christine
Pomeroy, Ednah Robinson, Elizabeth

talk abroad of high stakes in some

to boast of their losses? In that they
are distinctly unlike men, for who

The events of the week were the
weddings that graced it.
On Wednesday the Tisdale- Weeks
affair at San Jose was distinctive from
its fellows in that its prettiest acces
sories were unpremeditated.
Miss Tisdale. remaining true to the
home of childhood and loving the
dear little Ivy-grown Church-Around

Jose and in the quaint little chapel In
which ehe had worshiped since in her
pinafore days.' And in her decision was
a literal determination to be "quietly"
At last handsome Anna Head has be

At last, after twelve long years of si
lent submission to the obdurate will of
her father, Addison Head, the million
aire mining man, she was permitted to
lay her hand in the hand of the man
she loved, and they pledged to each other
before the law the constancy and love
that each had shown in the passing
years. Mountenay-Jephson was Just
such a man as would captivate the
heart of a maid who loved courage and
daring, for had he not served with
honor in Stanley's . search for Emin
Pasha? Full of anecdote, fascinating in
person (it is said he closely resembles
Tirey L. Ford) and madly in love with
the handsome Anna, he made famous

The Moore-Meigs wedding In Ross
was a comparatively quiet affair, ow
ing to the death of the bride's father
last winter. But it was a June wed
ding. And a June wedding in the coun

wholesomeness that must linger with
the bride while memory lasts. Miss
Moore was attended by her sister. Miss
Florence, as maid of honor, and three
bridesmaidsâ Misses Helen Meigs. Ma

Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor,
which is the highest grade of that his
toric order. " It Is an honor rarely be
stowed, even on chiefs of state and
Embassadors, and this is the first time
it has ever been offered to a representa

sions of the constitution the acceptance
of any mark of distinction from a for

quires the approval of Congress, final
action in the matter will await the au
thorization of that body.
Foreign Minister Delcasse called at
tne Embassador's residence to-day and
personally presented him with the sn
perb insignia of the Grand Cross. This
consists of a wide silk band worn
across the breast, having an enameled
gold cross at the hip, with an elaborate
silver star to be worn on the right
breast. M. Delcasse accompanied the
presentation by an earnest expression
of the high personal esteem which M.
Loubet and himself felt toward the
American republic.

CHICAGO, June 18. â The advance
guard of the delegations to the Repub
lican National Convention has arrived
in Chicago and the. greater number of
delegates are expected to come to-mor
row-and on Monday morning.
The running of theDerby to-day inter
fered sadly with the political game, as
nearly all the members of the National
Committee and a great number of dele
gates, deserted their headquarters to
visit Washington Park. So many of
them ' attended the races that the
downtown hotels, where the crowd will
be the greatest when the convention Is
In full blast, were about as quiet as
on days wh p n there is nothing par
ticular in view. j { (1
From ail ihe advance indications, the
convention promises to lack something
of the excitement of other gatherings
of its'. kind. The chief interest so far
centers in the Vice Presidential nom
ination. .The opposition against Secre
tary Cortelyou for chairman of the Na
tional Committee seems to be dying
somewhat and various members of the
National Committee predicted to-day
that he would be elected without oppo
sition. The fight against him; they de
clare, is not strong enough to make
any trouble.
ATTITUDE OF FAIRBANKS.
The attitude of Senator Fairbanks
regarding the nomination for Vice
President is not pleasing to many of
the' arriving delegates, who say that
he should declare himself more ex
plicitly. | The great majority of the
delegates who. have so far arrived fa
vor him or are not actively opposed to
him, but - they desire a j statement of
some kind.
Congressman James A. Hemenway of
Indiana,' who' Is a close friend of Sen
ator Fairbanks, said this morning that
the Senator -would not make a state
ment of any kind; that -he would ac
cept the nomination If it were present
ed to him, but that h.e would not de
clare that he wanted it. When asked If
Indiana'would present the name of the
Senator when" nominations for the
place were called for, he said that it
would noti and he did not know wheth
er any other State would do so.
- John' L. -Webster of Nebraska, who
Is a candidate for Vice President, ar
rived during the afternoon and regis
tered at the Palmer House, where the
Nebraska 'delegation will 'make its
headquarters. He refused to say a
word regarding his candidacy, except
to remark that he was satisfied with
the outlook.
The La Follette faction from Wiscon

If the national" convention follows ; the

MEANING OF THE VISIT.
By F. W. BISHOP.
EtaS Correspondent of The Call.
California's delegation is occupying
an uncertain attitude regarding the
aspirants for Vice President, of whom
there are several. While it is probable
that California's delegation will declare
in favor of Fairbanks of Indiana at
next Monday's meeting, New York will
prevent any ante-convention action of
the kind on the part of the Callfornlans
if possible. . ; New York's , delegation,
headed by. Governor Odell, is active in
the interest of lionized "Joe" Cannon,
Speaker of the House/, of Representa
tives, notwithstanding Cannon's an
nouncements that under I no circum
stances will he yield the Congressional
gavel to take up* that In the Senate.
When Odell'B , efforts to sow the seeds
of a stampede for_ Cannon .reached the
latter's ears to-day,' his anger burst
and in its '? ventlng s the ; venerable
Speaker of the r House added * to his
reputation as a man of large vocabu-
Another development of Importance
to California is contained in the an
nouncement that no stronger resolu
tions will go before the convention
than those recommending the immedi
ate completion of the Panama Canal
arid indorsing in every detail the policy
of the Roosevelt administration that
made the construction of the canal pos
sible. Resolutions and platform ma
terial regarding the tariff and kindred
Governmental questions, it is prob

of the orators, no matter how widely
divergent their ideas, but before the
gavel's fall commands the convention
to come to order, the canal resolution
will be ready for submission. \S'

. "Now, every commercial organiza
tion in California' should rise to this
occasion," he - said. "Any measures
this committee may adopt will benefit
the south of the State as much as it
will the north and as much as it will
the nation. When this committee ar
rives In California all the statistics it
requires should be on hand and every
commercial 'man of note should be on
hand to give his j opinion. The ques
tion is a big one and big minds should
grapple with it."
Delegate Frank H. Short of Fresno
added that California's Representatives
in Congress should anticipate the com
ing of the committee and prepare to
lend their fullest aid to the Important
work. Judge J. W. McKinley of Los
Angeles and M. A. Gunst of San Fran
cisco announced that they would place
their services at the disposal of the
committee and in this they will not be
ahead of the entire delegation. Cali

The Japanese outposts are eighteen
miles from Port Arthur, ' beyond the
station at Intchenze, two miles from
the Russian outposts. Skirmishes oc
casionally occur. The Russian officers
believe the fortress to be Impregnable.
An enormous number of cattle? the
advices say, were brought into Port
Arthur a few days before the Invest
ment was completed. Meat now costs
but 13 cents a pound, beer is sold at 30
cents a bottle and champagne at 14 a
bottle. A band plays on the boulevard
three times each week.
Most of the inhabitants have enlisted
in the volunteers and 600 women have
offered their services. Perfect- order is
maintained and trade and industry are
carried on as usuaL Provisions are
plentiful, there being a sufficient sup
ply to last six months at full rations
and a year at reduced rations.
PLEATY OF BEEF AND BEER.
According to trustworthy news from
Pert Arthur there had not been a fresh
attack by land or sea up to June 14,
though the Japanese had made, a fourth
unsuccessful attempt to block the en
trance to the harbor, using four fire
ships, two of which were Immediately
sunk by shots from the batteries, the
other two withdrawing.
The Russian fleet, according to these
advices, is intact and the spirits of the
garrison and Inhabitants are excellent.
The soldiers are eager to fight and are
confident of the impossibility of the
taking of Port Arthur by the Japanese.
NEWS FROM PORT ARTHUR.
LIAOYANG. June 18.â The retirement
of the Russians before a superior force
from Vafangow and the advance of
the Japanese east and northeastward
make imminent a still more important
engagement 'in the southern, region.
The Japanese have now arrived at a
point where the forces are more equal
and where they must fight on more
even terms. The loss of 2000 men by
the two Russian divisions at Vafangow
shows . the courage and ability of* the
officers and troops to retain their posi
tion under a percentage of loss almost
unprecedented. The Japanese attack
on Port Arthur has been delayed.
The overcrowded hospital trains are
inspected while passing Liaoyang by
General Kuropatkin and Grand Duke
Boris.
TOKIO, June 18, 0 p. m. â In addi
tion to -jinking the transport Hltashi
and shelling the transport Sado, the
Russians sank the Idzumi, a transport
homeward bound, carrying a few sick
soldiers. Three boats from the Id
zumi reached shore. The losses on the
ldznml are not known.
Mulhall then ran into another pike
inclosure, where he was arrested.
Mulhall, it is said, previous to running
away, pointed his weapon a.tJ Cum
mings, proprietor of the show, but did
not shoot. *;-** 'â¢-Â¦â¢'
Mulhall then fired point blank at
Reed, the first bullet striking him in the
arm. The second grazed his neck and
hit Morgan. The additional shots fired
by Mulhall went wild.
To-night at" the conclusion of the
Wild West Show, Mulhall met Reed
as he . was emerging from the show.
Mulhall drew his revolver, but before
he could use it Murrah attempted to
take it away. In the scuffle the weapon
was discharged and Murrah was
wounded.
This afternoon, according to Reed,
he received word that some horses
which had gone astray had been taken
up in St. Louis County and he went
out to get them. He took "California
Jack" Roberts with him over the pro
test of Mulhall, who did not want
Roberts to go.
After they returned Mulhall went to
the stables and, noticing that one of
tho horses had been used, asked what
he had been doing with it. Reed told
him that he had ridden the horse when
he went after the strays. This was
after the show last night. A bitter
quarrel followed, in which Mulhall
drew his revolver and threatened to
shoot j Reed. The latter, not being
armed, desisted. '
MULHALL OPENS FIRE.
There has been trouble for some time
between Mulhall and Reed. The lat
ter says it waa because Mulhall tried
to run things, although he was only an
employe, like Reed. Last week Mulhall
had Reed arrested on the charge of dis
turbing the peace and Reed wasÂ»flned
550.
1LWE LONG BEEN ENEMIES.
ST. LOUIS, June 18.â Zach Mulhall.
livestock agent of the St. Louis and
San Francisco Railroad, to-night shot
three men in front of the entrance of
the Wild West Show, on the pike, at
the World's Fair. One of them, an in
nocent bystander named Ernest Mor
gan, was fatally wounded. He was shot
in the abdomen. The other men are
Frank Reed, boss hostler of the Wild
West Show, and Johnny Murrah, one
of the cowboys. They are being cared
for at the Emergency Hospital on the
World's Fair grounds.
The doctors say that Morgan will
die. He lives in St. Louis and is IS
years old. Frank Reed, who is 60
years old, was shot in the arm and the
right side of the neck. Murrah, aged
35 years, was shot in the abdomen.
The shooting was the culmination of
trouble between Mulhall and Frank
Reed over the question of 'authority.
It occurred at the entrance of the show,
just at the conclusion of^j. performance,
while the pike was crowded. Mulhall
was locked up and bail was refifeed.

STAMFORD, Conn., June 18.â John
Bradleys, who was one of the oldest,
if not the oldest man in America, is
dead at Fitch's Soldier's Home at Noro
ton Heights, Conn. He claimed to be
136 years old and was proud of his
longevity. The hospital authorities at
Noroton Heights calculate that he was
at least 115 years of age. He was born
In Ireland and came to this country
when a young man. The outbreak of
the Civil War found him In New Haven
and he was then an old man. He was
anxious to enlist and to give himself
the appearance of youth he dyed his
hair black. The ruse appears to have
succeeded, for. he was admitted to the
Sixth Connecticut. About ten years
ago he was admitted to the home. He
always smoked and drank aa much as
he wanted and could procure.

The first sign of a fight in the com
mittee on resolutions came into sight
to-day in the efforts of Senator Hans
brough of North Dakota to enlist re
cruits in favor of a declaration for re
vision of the tariff. The Senator claims
that in his interviews with delegates
and members of the National Commit
tee he has found a strong sentiment In
favor of reciprocity, especially with
Canada. The Senator would not say
that he expected to get such a plank
into the platform, as he clearly under
stood that the "stand patters" were in
control and would be likely to have
matters their own way. However, he Is
determined to make a fight before the
committee for the insertion of a revi
sion plank.

TARIFF ISSUE SHOWS UP.
Secretary Dover of the National Com
mittee announced this afternoon the
official programme for the three days
of the convention. It is as follows:
Tuesday, June 21â Convention called
to order by Chairman Henry C. Payne;
prayer by Rev. Timothy P. Frost;
reading of the call for the convention
by Secretary Elmer Dover; introduc
tion of temporary chairman Elihu
Root, who will address the convention
and report the names of the temporary
officials; appointments of committees
on permanent organization, credentials,
rules and resolutions.
Wednesday, June* 22â Prayer by Rev.
Thomas E. Cox; report of the commit
tee on resolutions; report of the com
mittee on permanent organization; In
troduction and speech' of Permanent
Chariman Joseph G. Cannon; report of
the committee on rules; naming by
State delegations of the members of
the new National Committee.
"There is one man whom I consider
eminently qualified for the place, and
in my opinion he would be the strong
est candidate we can have as a run
ning mate for Mr. Roosevelt. He Is
one of the old Lincoln Republicans,
and the lines of the early Republican
faith have not been Ironed out of him
yet I almost am afraid to tell his
name, because I know that he has said
that he does not want the^pyace, but I
am in favor of 'Joe* Cannon. I mean
I would like to be for him if I were not
afraid to be so. I understand that he
had men thrown out of the recent Re
publican convention in this State just
because they mentioned him as a can
didate for Vice President.
"As to Senator Fairbanks, I under
stand that he will not say he wants
the place and that he will not aeek it
in any way. " do not think he can be
elected to tho position if he will not
seek it a little bit. An Illinois man
in the second place on the ticket' would
please us In New York."
CONVENTION PROGRAMME. .
Chauncey M. Depew arrived at the
Auditorium during the afternoon, as

Senator Platt. Senator Depew, In dis
cussing the Vice Presidential matter,
said: Â«^ ; "ir^.->Â»
The delegates from New York, the
majority of whom arrived during the
afternoon and evening, made it evident
that the Empire State is not in favor
of Senator Fairbanks for Vice Presi
dent. Elihu Root, who is to be the
temporary chairman of the, convention,
was the first of the prominent New
Yorkers to put in an appearance. t
"There is a strong Hitt sentiment In
New York," said Root, "and we are of
the opinion t/hat he will make a strong
candidate. The fact that Senator Fair
banks has expressed no wish for the
place has served to aid the candidacy
of Hitt."

Derby.
"We have no Instructions," said Gov
ernor Carter, "except to vote for Presi
dent Roosevelt. We have formulate'd
no plan as to the Vice Presidency, but
we favor Senator Fairbanks at pres
ent." tv:v
The amenities of the Journey con
cluded with the presentation to Chair
man McKinley by John M. Switzer,
chairman of the Philippine delegation,
of a splendid set of views of the islands
bound in morocco. This, said Switzer,
was a Email token of his appreciation
of the courtesies that had been extend
ed him by the California delegation.
ThÂ« California delegation, replied
McKinley, was delighted that It had
been given opportunity to extend the
courtesies so tactfully acknowledged.
CALIFORNIA'S HEADQUARTERS.
The California headquarters are lo
cated on- the second floor) of the Audi
torium, between those of Ohio and
Missouri. Though the room is small,
it is handsomely decorated and will
servo its purpose well. Flags panel the
walls and French drapery of white and
gold shimmers against the ceiling. A
large table, draped in the national col
ors, and chairs for the delegates com
plete the -furnishing.
For this the delegation is paying $30
a day. It is not the quality but the
quantity of this room that is exciting
the delegates. They are of the opinion
that they are being plundered. One of
them remarked he had. finally solved
the problem as to why Black Bart mado
his living robbing stages in the West â
he was too honest to run a hotel in Chi
cago.
This has been the howl all over the
city. Rooms that a week ago wept
for an occupant at $7 a week now smile
with an income of that much a day.
Third-class houses that were are now
aristocratic hostel rles. r
In this California's delegation sees a
chance to -secure for San Francisco,
with her superb facilities for housing
her guests, the next national conven
tion.
Chicago's welcome to the California
delegation and its guests, the delega
tions J^om Nevada, Hawaii and the
Philippines, was^most cordial, but the
austerity of the occasion was in a
measure Jarred' by Irreverent trades
men. When the special train drew into
the depot a long line of carriages was
in waiting to convey the delegates and
their families to their various quar
ters. Preceded by the ' Indiana band,
this imposing line of drags started for
the Auditorium. Not many blocks had
been covered, however, before the pa
rade was liberally interspersed with
coal carts, butcher carts, mule rigs and
hansoms. Though this interference
added somewhat to the picturesqueneas
of the pageant. It hardly contributed to
Its dignity. However, the additloni to
the parade were lost befora Michigan
avenue was reached, and to the stirring
strains of "There'll Be a Hot Time"
the delegation alighted and was es
corted to headquarters.
The last day's run of the California
delegation's special was delightful.
Cool breezes Invigorated the travelers,
and congratulations have been show
ered upon the weather. All were so
pleased with the management of the
train that a resolution of thanks to
A. H. Abbott, San Francisco passen
ger agent of the Chicago and North
western Railroad, who brought the
train through, was adopted and signed
by all of the travelers.

to see a scheme to place "Jim" Sher
man of New York In the Speaker's
chair. Cannon wants to stay where he
is, he says, and says It savagely. It Is
the general opinion that he will.
Congressman Hltt of Illinois and
Cyrus P. Walbridse of Missouri, ex
ilayor of St. Louis, are also In the run
ning for Vice President, but so far they
have not sought California's support.

The Personal Word by Mr. Lawson
Personally I know that one hundred millinos of dollars were lost, thirty
men committed suicide and twenty previously reputable citizens went to
tie penitentiaiy, directly because of Amalgamated.
It -was lzrpjdy because of my efforts that the foundation of Amalga- *
mxted was successfully laid. It was created because of my work. It was
becanse of what I stood for. because I had the public's confidence, and be-
czsse my promises had been kept that the plain people invested two hun-
dred million dollars of their savings, and it was because of trickery and
broken promises that the public lost the enormous sums they did.
My motrres for writing the Story of Amalgamated are manifold: I
hire caTrittiagly been made the instrument by which thousands upon thou-
sands of investors in America and Europe have been plundered. I wish
them to know my position as to the Past, that they may acquit me of inten-
tional wrongdoing; as to the present, that they may know that I am doing
ail in my power to right the wrongs that have been committed; and as to
the futcre, that they may see how I propose to compel restitution.
' THOMAS W. LAWSON.
A Statement by the Publishers of
Everybody's Magazine
In the articles by Mr. Lawson, beginning in the July number, under the
caption of "Frenzied Finance, The Story of Amalgamated," we have a nar-
rative from Mr. Lawson's own lips how, in the last few years, he has seen
millions of dollars won without right and thousands of men ruined. It is a
Ftory of financial tragedy of to-day.
In the great financial happenings of recent years story tellers have
given their version, political economists their theories, reformers their pic-
tures and historians their tablets. For the first time in the history of High
Finance we have the High Priest tell it as it happened, and it is for Every-
body's Magazine to publish the "cold-blooded facts." for Mr. Lawson has
pledged himself to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

June 4. The New York took the Cross

of the local company, using them in
j stead of the Stable-Arco coherers

At 6 p. m. the flagship wired in that

hard and that the vessel was rolling.
One of the officers aboard, whose wife
is in Honolulu, was extremely anxious
to ascertain whether she could return
to the mainland on the Korea, and
whether she could get good accommo

right for the Korea. A number of pri

"I have just returned from a meet
ing of the Board of Aldermen, it being
in reference to the awful calamity

women and children perished.
"This misfortune has touched every

SICKIJES BLAMES INSPECTORS.
General Daniel E. Sickles, a member
of the Board of Aldermen, late thi3
afternoon sent the following communi
cation to President Roosevelt:
by the city this afternoon, a special
plat In the Lutheran Cemetery having
been' provided. Of the twenty- nine
bodies only one was that of a man,
there being eleven children and seven
teen women. As the fourteen hearses
carrying the unknown victims of the
disaster passed an unusually large
crowd stood respectfully on the side
walks, making a line extending several
blocks to the pier, whence the ferry
carried them over to the Long Island
fhore. The men stood with bowed and
uncovered heads, and by far the great
er portion of the women and chil
dren knelt Even those who are or
dinarily phlegmatic and undemonstra
tive were affected by the sorrow that
all seemed to feel, and sobs shook the
frames of the women, while tears
streamed down the cheeks bf the men.
The cortege continued through the
street lined by mourning thousands un
til it became a part of the long pro
cession of funerals that were wending
their way to the cemetery.
A diver who to-day renewed the
search for victims found a deep hole in
the bed of the river practically filled
with bodies. Within an hour after the
search was begun eight bodies had
been brought to the surface, and when
he was forced to abandon work for a
time because of the swift current he
said that between thirty and fifty bod
ies still remained in the hole.
The unknown and unclaimed dead,
numbering twenty-nine, were buried
earlier than they admitted at the out
set. Charles Lang, who is searching
for a missing child, Informed the police
that the deckhands knew of the fire be
fore the Slocum had passed Fifty-sev
enth street- Lang said the flames were
visible to all on board by the time the
steamboat reached Eighty-ninth street
Witnesses summoned to appear be
fore Coroner Berry In Bronx on Mon
day will attempt to show that a mem
ber of the crew was responsible for the
fire. This deckhand admits that he
ran away as soon as he learned of It,
and one of his former associates insists
that he ran before anybody else knew
that there was any trouble.
More than 200 subpenas have been
issued for. the inquest, which may last
a week. Pilots and river men will tes
tify about the opportunities to beach
the Slocum before reaching the Island
and about the conditions of wind and
time. Another investigation is to be
begun at once by the Department of
Labor and Commerce and Coroner Ber
ry has supplied the list of his witnesses
to Supervising Inspector Rodie.
DIVER FIXDS MANY BODDZS.
"Even if it would not have bee'n
burned, the boat, striking the Mead
ows, would have backed oft* again, and
everybody on board would have been
drowned in deep water when jumping
off."
"A short distance ahead and to the
westward was a large tug. I had no
choice but to keep on for the island.
If I had stopped and turned round
and gone back to the Sunken Meadows
the chances were lhat the boat would
have been burned to the water's edge
and the passengers with it before we
reached the Meadows.
Captain Van Shaick. who is lying
at the Lebanon Hospital with a broken
foot and severe burns about the head,
has given out an interview replying
to the criticisms of his conduct it hav
ing been .alleged that he ran the boat
two miles past at least eight places
where it could have been beached
after the fire was discovered. He is
quoted as follows:
"I was in my cabin when some one
yelled 'Fire*' through the tube," he
said. "I ran out, saw the flames
sweeping over the boat, ran back,
waited five seconds and then gave the
order to run ahead .to North Brother
Island and beach the boat sideways,
believing thfs was our only chance.
"The critics don't know the terri
tory. We. were more than 2000 feet
above the buoys on the Sunken Mead
ows and about 2000 feet from North
Brother Island and were going at fif
teen miles an hour.
The deeds, insurance policies and
the bank books are all in the name of
a person whom, it would seem, is quite
different from Eva Kruger, but the
Coroner is keeping the name secret for
the present and is considerably puzzled
because the woman has not been iden
tified by relatives.
VAN SCIIAICK EXPLAINS.
part of the world. Of course, you havÂ«
already taken such steps in the right
direction as becomes your office, but I
trust you will not regard it amiss to
receive a suggestion or two from onÂ«Â»
of the city fathers.
"There Is an Impression here that thÂ«
Federal officials charged with the duty
of Inspecting steamboats have been
negligent and inefficient and that they
are gravely at fault in not having done
what they might have done to avoid
what has happened.
"Pray see that these inspectors shall
be competent and trustworthy, and, if
further legislation be necessary to pro
vide safeguards for the future, charge
Congress to provide them.
"You will asree with me, I am sure,
that a prompt and thorough Investiga
tion of all the facts is of prime Im
portance, as well to nx responsibility
for the past'^as to provide guarantee
for the future. Sincerely yours,
"DANIEL E. SICKLES."
KAISER SENDS CONDOLENCES.
A telegram was received to-day
from the German Embassado'r at
Washington, Baron, Speck von Stern
burg, inclosing the following cable
gram from the German Emperor:
"Being most profoundly affected by
the news of the indescribably horrible
catastrophe which has overtaken the
Lutheran congregation, I command
you to express to it my innermost
feelings of sorrow."
Of the money, jewelry and other
valuables taken from the dead In the
Slocum disaster, aggregating nearly
5200,000, much has been claimed
from the Coroner by relatives. There
is one package, however, for which no
claim has yet been established. It was
found on the body of a woman at first
supposed to be that of Eva Kruger,
but has not yet been identified.
The property consists of eight bank
books, showing deposits of nearly
$25,000 in eight of the best known
savings institutions of New York; two
or three life insurance policies,
amounting in all to- about 510,000 or
$15,000; deeds to property* in New
York and elsewhere and a consider
able amount in bank notes.
NT7W YORK. June 18.â Seventeen
more bodies of the Slocum disaster's
victims were recovered to-day, making
E77 la alL Of these 623 have been Iden
tified and thirty were burned beyond
chance of recognition. The number of
missing Is 229. In the hospitals are
fifty-three who were Injured, # all of
Â¦whom are progressing favorably.
Under instruction from Mayor Mo-
Clellan, Police Commissioner McAdoo
has entered Into a contract for raising
the hull of the Slocum and towing it to
Hikers Island. The cost of this work
will be 511,000. It is believed many more
bodies vrill be found in the interior of
the boat and under the wheels. The
original intention of blowing up the re
mains of the boat with dynamite was
abandoned, because It was feared thÂ«
bodies under It would be mangled. The
raising may bring to light physical evi
dences of the cause of the disaster.
Many liberal contributions were
made to the Mayor's fund for the re
lief of BUfferers.'lncluding 51000 from J.
P. Morgan & Co. The present total of
ths fund is 522.000. A resolution
authorizing the city to contribute 550.000
was Introduced in the Board of Alder
men, and, while it failed to pass, as
there were not enough members pres
*nt, it was made a special order for the
next meeting.
Mourning was generally displayed
throughout the city. Many business
houses were closed In the section sur
rounding St Mark's Lutheran Church.
There were 190 funerals of victims In
this district. Including thosa of the
wife and sister of Rev. George C. F.
Haas, pastor of the church.

that the fire on the Slocum was known

and without reserves. It is believed
Kurokl really contemplated combined
operations to cut off and pocket Stakel

is understood .that Kuropatkin sent a
strong Russian force south of the Liao

sible that a general engagement may

MUTILATION" OF WOUNDED.
.. ST. PETERSBURG, June 18.â Colonel
Merchausky, commander of the Fourth
Infantry Regiment, was taken prisoner
by the, Japanese at Vafangow.
The charge that the Japanese mu
tilated Russian wounded found in the
bushes about the battlefield of Va
fangow is repeated by Russian corre
spondents. Nemirovich Danchenko,
probably the best known of the Rus
sian .war. correspondents, says a hos
pital assistant in charge ,,Â¦ of three
â¢wounded soldiers, having been driven
off on the approach of some 'Japanese
cavalry, saw the' latter mutilate the
wounded men, Inflicting stabs - and
slashes. One body showed twenty
eight wounds on the head, the face was
cut open, the eyes were gouged out,
the breasts were pierced and the knees
were crushed by rifle butts. The skull
of one man was crushed.
Danchenko declares that this hor
rible practice was indulged in by the
Bashi Fazouks in the Turkish war. -Â»
Danchenko asserts that General Slm
onoff, commander of the Siberian
division of Cossack cavalry, drew up
a statement in regard to the Japanese
mutilations, which was signed by the
British, French and Spanish military
attaches.
NAGASAKI. June 18.â Thirty more
Furvivors from the transport Hitachi
have arrived at Bakata (seventy miles
from here); and it is probable that more
survivors have reached the adjacent
islands. The authorities are reticent
about the extent of the losses.
TOKIO, June 18.â The Vladivostok
squadron has disappeared off the
vest coast of Aomoii prefecture. The
Russians recently searched two mer
chantmen and to one of them trans

Japanese transport Sado. They then
permitted the vessels to depart.
TOKIO, June 18.â Five hundred and
nine survivors cf the Japanese trans
ports Rado and Hitachi, which .were
destroyed by Russian warships,, have
arrived at southern ports. The Rus
sians permitted 610 non-combatants to
leave the Sado, but their whereabouts
is unknown. ;
The Japanese officers and soldiers
who were detained on board the Sado
had prepared to commit suicide, but
changed their minds when the Russian. 1 ?
euddonly departed. â¢ . '
Apparently no chance v.-as given the
non-cordbatants' on board the Hitachi

ST. PETERSBURG, , June IS.â The

come of a plan agreed upon 'by Viceroy
Alexieff and General Kuropatkin, at

satisfied with the results of Stakel

dispatch north of detachments of the

General Nodzu, delaying the siege to
that extent, while at sea the raid of the
Russian squadron has rendered the fur

Prince h.id been deposed and executed

The Vladivostok message shows that

in the way of reprisals for the destruc-

however, so far as can be learned, that
the Japanese squadron has appeared

TOKIO, June 18. â The Japanese
Government may decide not to make
any formal protest through Franca
against the alleged* violation of the
Japanese nag at the battle of Tellssu,
on the ground of uselessness. Herein
lies one disadvantage of the Japanese
plan to restrict military observers and
press correspondents. No matter how
flagrant the violations they may charge
of the law of nations, they are unable
to substantiate them without the tes
timony of neutral witnesses.

eighteen ttÂ»Â«Â»Â» south of Toano by W.
S. Orlvwold. who reoognlzed the horses
from the descriptions sent out from
here. The xnea were brought to Elko
yesterday by Sheriff Clark, and then It
was found that they tallied exactly
with the pictures and descriptions of
the Gates brothers, excepting that one
Is a little taller than the description;
but the gunshot wounds, features and
general znake-np tally exactly. The
men gave the names of H. T. Thomas
and Ed Armstrong. When Interviewed
this morning they made a full confes
eJen ef stealing the horses, but refused
to tell of their whereabouts previous
to the robbery. It Is said that Just be
fore their arrest they held up and rob

SACRAMENTO. June 18. â Represen
' tatlves of thlrty-slx counties were pres
ent at the meeting in the Assembly
chamber to-day held under the aus
pices of the California Promotion Com
mittee. Rufus P. Jennings of* San
Francisco, the executive officer of the
committee, presided and explained that
the purpose of the conference was to
enable all to become better acquainted
and to discuss plans for centralizing
promotion efforts. ' Among thÂ© speakers
was Congressman J. C. Needham, whci
denounced the National Irrigation As- <
Bociatlon as a fraud, run In private In
terests. Congressman Theodore A. Bell
agreed with Xeedham, adding that It
was the Irrigation Congress and. not \
the Irrigation Association that was do- â¢
ing the real work of improvement.
The spirit manifested in the ad
dresses by the representatives from the
many counties was one of co-operation,
and the determination was expressed
that hereafter the commercial bodies
would send homeseekers to thoee coun
ties where they could be best suited,
en the principle that it is better for one
county to lose them than to have them
leave the State.

that of A. G. Balaam of Santa Barbara

I have come from the south to meet
you of the north and say to you that
the time for petty jealousies and sneers
and flings on one side or the other has
gone by. We are working now for the
entire State."

negro who practices chiropody, palm
istry, phrenology and several . other
sciences, medical and occult, at 425
Bush street, was the stellar defendant
on Police Judge Mogan's morning list.
The charge was disturbance of the
peace and the complainant was Mile.
Letizla Belzler. a pretty and* petite
French governess employed at 1118
Sacramento street. She and the dusky
scientist were engaged in a wordy
wrangle Friday afternoon at Bush and
Dupont streets when Patrolman J. T.
Lankman arrived on the scene and ar
restÂ«d the man when the woman had
stated that 6he was trying to collect
from him $10 which he had fraudulent
ly obtained from her.
Mile. Belzier informed the court that
on May 4 last she responded to a ring
of the door bell at her place of em- I
ployment and found Walts on the
porch. He asked her If she were*
troubled by corns or bunions and when
she replied in the negative he suddenly
seized her hand, peered at its palm a
moment and exclaimed: "Yo've got
ten dollahs In gole money." As she
did happen to have the sum mentioned
and it was in the metal designated, she
was a little frightened by her visitor's
seeming omniscience and under the im
pulse of fear she withdrew her hand
and sought to retire. "Doan tryter
git away from me, chile," said the"
mysterious stranger, "fo' its no use. I
knows all about yer an' I knows dat
yo's gwlne ter let me hev dat yah ten
dollahs ter 'vest fo' yo' and make
5300." As he spoke his foot was pressed
against the door, preventing her shut
ting him out, and finally she was per
suaded to admit him to the house and
learn all about how he could raise her
to affluence. Seated in the parlor, her
open palms In his hand, he told of the
strange power that_ enabled him to
foretell In dreams the winners of horse
races, and cited numerous instances
where his lack of capital was all that
saved the booking ring at Emeryville
from bankruptcy. Under the spell bf
his presence Bhe gave him her golden
half-eagle.
"Doan yo* worry." was his parting
speech. "Dis yah little coin am der
nucklus ob a vast forchln dat my
dreams am goin' ter airn fo' yo'."
He never repeated his visit to Mile.
Belzier and when she met him by
mere chance on Friday afternoon and
inquired about the investment he dis
claimed all knowledge of her.
"Go 'way, chile," "he said, "doan pes
ter me wlf yo' ridicerlous persump
shuns. I'se too busy ter waste time on
yo'."
The rest has been told.
Officer Lankman told the court that
he had found other ladies who claimed
to have been taken in and done for by
; Waits, among them a Mrs. Cook of
San Rafael, who had also been gulled
by the dream story, and might be in
duced to testify. So the case was con

"A famous military commander once

well, for the defense, "and in this case
the court can conscientiously be chari

fendant, when he invited death by

A PHILOSOPHER'S FABLE.
That he who runs may read *
and Ponder thereupon.
And it came to pass that a
certain people having waxed
mighty in numbers and great
in riches, said, "Let us now hold
a .Great Assembly and invite
the Nations of the Earth that
they may come in and see."
And the Place' was at the
Meeting of Mighty .Waters, and
the peoples of divers lands did
bring of their own Products and
of the, -Things which they had
cunningly contrived with their
hands, and did show' them
there. And the Gathering . To-
gether, from, all the corners of
the earth was more marvelous
than -in 'all ages before in the
memory of man.
Now, in the Land-by-the-Sea,
where the. sun dieth at close of
day, dwelt a great people, and
many set their faces to go to
the Assembling of the People
at the Place where the Father
of the Waters, runs his mighty
course. But some went by
strange and .devious paths and
byways and by caravans, which
were _slow of speed, making
man^ camps, along .the â¢ way,
and when they reached . their
journey's end they laid them
down and' beat their "breasts
and cried, "We are weary;
would that we had not come."
And straightway these foolish
ones returned, seeing but little
of the wondrous palaces at the
Gathering Together. And reach-
ing home, their brethren did
ask them of that they did see,
but they answered perversely,
"Trouble us not, for the way
was long, the sights were
naught and we are weary."
But others who were wise be-
took themselves by a pathway
and caravan which for speed
and for comfort and for exceed-
ing swiftness had no equal. And
these reached the Great Assem-
bly in joy and sojourned there
many ' days, marveling at the

they returned they gathered to-

California City, Near Tibu

Forrr.*r Congressman S. D. Woods
and Attorney Bert Schlesinger have
been informed by the Government offi
cials that the bureau of equipment.
Navy Department, has purchased from
their clients, Lynde & Hough, the
property known as "California City."
near Point Tiburon, in Marin County,
California, for 580,000.
The attorneys were notified to com
plete the abstract to date, in order
that the United States Attorney might
report on th's title. The property con
tifts of 55.S5 acres. The Govern
ment wiJI make of it a modern coal
ing station- Rear Admiral McCalla,
commandant at Mare Island, has urged
that the Government acquire this prop
erty because of its splendid facilities
'Â¦ir a coaling station. It is an ideal
/>l>ot for that purpose. The Government
has already begun work thereon and
will prosecute it diligently. The prop
erty has been in the hands of its pres
ent owners for more than thirty years.
It has np<->n it a*large number of ware
house?, used for drying fish, chiefly
cod, brought here from northern
waters.
plans' ron great station.
The new coaling station is intended
to have a capacity of 100,000 tons. To
Etore this amount of coal and make it
accessible to the Government shipping
of all classes several hundred thousand
dollars will be spent in erecting
wharves, coal bunkers and apparatus
for handling the coal,
TliÂ«Â» coaling of battleships in the
stream has provrd unsatisfactory. At
California City all the requisites will be
at hand. Two hundred feet off shore
there is now- a depth of thirty feet of
water and the depth is satisfactory
over a uiflp area adjoining. The dredg
ing that ivill have to be performed to
permit a battleship of the make and
draft of the Oregon or her sister ships
to go to the wharves for coal will be
comparatively small in amount and
cost. West of the Bite selected the land
rises into a high bluff that makes an
efficient shelter against winds sweep
ing in from the ocean. Near the shore
there is a comparatively large area of
level land which will require only small
expenditure to put in shape to receive
the foundations of any structures that
may be needed.
CONVENIENT FOR ALL USES.
The station is almost opposite the
terminal of the Santa Fe Railway sys
tem at Point Richmond. It is distant
from Tlburon Only about one mile in an
air line and about three miles by fol
lowing the shore line around from Tib
uron.
The decision to select the site for the
station was based upon the recommen
dations of Rear Admiral Bradford, who
visited this coast last year for the pur
pose of finding out what facilities for
coaling existed in the harbor of San
Francisco, in the States north of Cali
fornia and in the insular possessions of
the United States in the Pacific.
The trial #6urt ordered Grannis to ad
vance the necessary funds/and he re
fused on the ground that the suit had
been settled. He was held to be' In con
tempt and was ordered into custody.
A petition for a writ of .pertiorarl was
presented to the Supreme Court in be
half of the defendant, but the action
of the lower tribunal Is upheld and
Grannis must pay or go to Jail.
Under the decision fathers, mothers,
sons' wives, daughters' husbands and
grandchildren and their husbands and
wives are exempt from*payment of the
tax. All brothers, sisters, cousins, un
cles, aunts and unrelated heirs must
pay the tax. â¢
The court also decided yesterday that
James B. Grannis was in contempt for
refusing to give his wife . the funds
necessary for the reopening of their
divorce eult. Mrs. Grapnls obtained a
final decree after the interlocutory law
was in force, fehe sought to reopen the
case altheugh she had won it pre
viously. . '. .
ing the constitutionality of the meas
ure. There is no further appeal, and
collateral heirs must henceforth sur
render a part of their legacies to the
State. The matter was brought before
the courts by George O. Campbell upon
the rendering of a decree of distribu
tion of the estate of his sister, Corne
lia Campbell.
The act wag contested on the two
grounds that the body of the measure
did not conform to the title and that
the law was class legislation. The
court admits a clerical error in the
title. of the act, but says the mistake
does not affect the constitutionality of
the provision.
The claES legislation is said to con
sist in the discrimination between di
rect and collateral heirs. It is argued
by the appellant that if a brother or
sister have to pay the tax, a son's wife
or daughter's husband should be com
pelled to do likewise. '
In answer to this argument the court
says: "A law is general and constitu
tional when it applies equally to all
pereons embraced in a class founded
upon some natural or intrinsic or con
stitutional distinction."
All doubt as to the validity of the
collateral inheritance tax law has van
ished, for the Supreme Court yesterday
reaffirmed its former decision sustain-

BERLIN, June 18. â Count von Hoens
broeck. the well-known political writer,
created a sensation to-day at the ses
sion of the Women's Congress. When
the fourth section, which was discuss
ing woman suffrage, had completed
the list of programme speakers, It
threw the subject open to discussion.
Von Hoensbroeck asked permission to
speak, and criticized the delegates to
the congress for accepting invitations
to garden partiesâ those of Chancellor
and Countess von Bulow and .Interior
Secretary and Countess von Posa
dowsky-Wehner â immediately after the
Government had declared that it would
not accept the woman suffrage amend
ment to the law creating' boards of ar
bitration for merchants and their em
ployes. Von Hoensbroeck said the
women should have politely informed
the Ministers that they were unable
to accept social courtesies under the
circumstances.
"The Secretary of the Interior," said
Von Hoensbroeck, "snubbed the suf
frage movement, but gave you straw
berries and cream."
Frauleln Freudenberg of Munich,
who presided, instantly repelled the
Count's criticism, and later Frauleln
Helene Lange returned to the subject
and said the advocates of women's
rights. hoped to have an opportunity
to meet their direct enemies socially
and explain their views.
The congress closed this afternoon
with an^ enormous meeting. The lead
ing speaker in the main hall was Mrs.
Parkins Gilman, who discussed Profes
sor Lester F. Ward's theory of the
biological origin of the sex, according
to which the female became the estab
lished type prior to the male.
Mrs. Gilman turned the theory to
account, asserting that society will not
be perfect until woman participates in
all human interests equally with man.
The j American delegates, according
to the German papers, made a general
impression, owing to the superiority of
their oratory, clear, concise statements
and distinct, deliberate speaking. ,

ROME, June 18. â Emperor William
has notified the King of Italy that in
case the infant expected. at the Qulri

been accepted. Many stories are told
indicating that the hopes of Italy for
an heir to the throne probably will be
realized. It is said that the Qulrinal

their advice Queen Helena has gone

VISITORS TO FAIR.
The Idaho commission to the World's
Fair consists of Governor J. T. Morri
son. C. B. Hurtt, James E. Steele, M.
J. Wessels, R. W. McBride. Dr. H. D.
Read and Mrs. H. W. Mansfield. The
agricultural and horticultural displays
are in charge of M. J. Wessels and wife
of Kendrick. R. W. McBride of Salmon
and M. B. McGlenn of Boise are at the
head of the mining display, and Mrs.
BImon Harris of Silver City is in charge
of the educational booth. A special ex
hibit of fish and game is made by C. C:
Tobias. In her educational exhibit
Idaho is abreast of any other State,
showing that her school advantages are
of the best.
Idaho, which is becoming noted for
her gold mines, her cereals and her ap
ples, is among the States that are well
represented at the fair. She has a pret
ty building not far from the California
structure. It Is of Spanish style and
has a court In the center, in which
bloom immense geraniums. Its several
rooms are furnished in a manner that
shows this mountain State to be not be
hind in taste and refinement. The hand
some furniture and hangings are well
set off by an artistic arrangement of
Indian baskets and curios. The build
ing is at present in charge of Hugh W.
Pettengill of Boise, secretary to Execu
tive Commissioner Hart. Many resi
dents of the State have visited the fair,
and they and others find the cool, shad
ed space around the court a comfort
able resting place during the warm
days.
Idaho's exhibit of cereals in the Agri
cultural building is one of the most
beautiful at the exposition. It is looked
upon as among those likeljfkto be prize
winners. Rare artistic ability has been
shown in the blending of grains and
the effect worked out. In the Horticul
tural building the State's apple display
te much admired. Idaho also shows an
excellent quality of dried prunes. Her
mining exhibit is one of the finest at
the fair. Besides all the gold ores,
there is a special display of lead ore,
one piece weighing eight tons.
In the Idaho building is shown the
cup awarded the State by the National
Irrigation Congress for the best fruits
grown on irrigated land. ,Â¦
$25 and the proceeds will be turned
into the club fund.

WISE WORDS.
A Physician on Food.
A physician of Portland, Oregon, has
views about food. He cays:
"I have always believed that the duty
of the physician does not cease with
treating the 6k k, but that we oweit to
humanity to teach them how to* pro-
tect their health, especially by hygien-
ic and dietetic laws.
"With *uch a feeling as to my duty
I take great pleasure In saying to the
public that in my own experience and
also from personal observation I have
found no food to equal Grape-Nuts and
that I find there is almost no limit to
thÂ» great benefit this food will bring
*\hen used in all cases of sickness and
convalescence.
"It is my experience that no physical
condition forbids the use of Grape-
Nuts. To persons in health there Is
nothing so nourishing and iicceptable
to the stomach, especially at breakfast,
to start the machinery of the human
system on the day's work. In cases of
indigestion I know that a completa
breakfast can be made of Grape-Nuts
and cream and I think it is necessary
not to overload the stomach at the
morning meal. I also know the great
value of Grape-Nuts when the stom-
ach is too weak to digest other food.
"This is written after an experience
of more than 20 years treating all man-
ner of chronic and acute diseases, and
the letter is written voluntarily on my
part without any request for it." Name

Specie Increased J4.723.800 and ' legal
tenders $1,779,000, making a total of
$6,502,800 gain in cash reserve. This
amount was $2,000,000 below the sum
which was estimated on the basis of
the traceable movements of money dur
ing the week.
Deposits increased $12,781,300, or
$1,318,000 less than the sum of the gain
in loans and in cash, therefore the
statement did not make a'good balance.
k The required reserve against general
deposits increased $3,195,325, deduct
ing which sum from the gain in cash
left $3,307,475 as the increase in sur
plus reserve to $38,869,875. This is
not only the maximum surplus for the
year, but the highest since May 27,
1899, when it was $43,933,725. .
Computed upon the basis of deposits,
leBS those of $23,420,700 "public funds,
the surplus Is $44,725,050. Circulation
increased $664,S00, a gain of $2,749,100

within J 9,750,000 of the highest on
record. The maximum of the former
was reached on May 14 and that of
the latter oh May 7.
As was expected would be the case,
the loan item was expanded as the re
sult of corporation and commission

proceeds of finance bills, the increase
being $7,596,500 for the week and of
$13,000,000 since the beginning ofjune.

MURDERER SEATENCED
TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT
The privilege reserved for the re
demption of the new preferred stock
at 115 for five years after July, 1905,
points to it as Intended for a tempo
rary expedient, with the refunding
bonds a probability on the first pro
pitious occasion. Current criticism
was inclined to imply a superior ad
vantage for Union Pacific in the plan,
for . the Union Pacific's control of
Southern Pacific made it responsible
for the Southern Pacific's large floating
indebtedness to the parent company
for advances for improvements and
Union Pacific's $90,000,000 of South
ern Pacific stock made parent com
pany a beneficiary both of the new
stock subscription privileges and of
the proceeds of the sale. On the other
hand, its large holdings of Southern.
Pacific make it a large sharer in any
disadvantages to the company. The
disadvantages of an authorized stock
issue entitled to $7,000,000 of annual
earnings In priority to the common
stock claims, although carrying a
common . stock privilege to subscribe
at par to the preferred, proved rather
formidable to holders of Southern Pa
cific, and it. was freely sold. The di
vergent movement in Unon Pacific
reached that the pTan was a sort of
compromise between the general re
funding bond issue, which had been
expected from Southern Pacific for
maturing and underlying mortgages
and to provide for immediate addi
tional capital needs and the device so
commonly employed of late by rail
road corporations of issuing short
itime notes for current capital needs.
Conditions are avowedly unpropitious
for the flotation of a large bond issue,
notwithstanding the recent evidences
of improvement in the market de
mand for railroad bonds.
TEMPORARY EXPEDIENT.
The dealings in the stock market
have been rather larger this week and
the price fluctuations wider, giving the
market an appearance of greater ani
mation. The fluctuations have been
both upward and downward and the
general level of prices has not moved
far from that of last week. Business
has been congested in a few stocks in
fluenced by special causes^ . and the
sharp upward movement in business
has helped the general market. The
most notable of the special movements
was that in Union Pacific and South
ern Pacific as an effect of the plan for
new preferred stock to be authorized
to the amount of $100,000,000 and* to
be issued at once to stockholders- at
par to the amount of $40,000,000, to
have 7 per cent dividends prior to the
common stock. The knowledge of
this plan came out by piecemeal.
The result w'assome skepticism in the
stock market, ; where the project was a
total surprise, and much debate and .
confusion as to the merits and effects
of the plan. Opinion on the subject
was not definite up to the end of the
week and the stock market continued
much unsettled in consequence. Its
importance and its probable large in
fluence on the market were undeniable,
owing to the magnitude of the opera
tions, if for no other cause. The rela
tive advantages or disadvantages to
Union Pacific, the parent capital, and
to Southern Pacific were eagerly can
vassed and with varying effect on
those two stocks.
Very generally the conclusion was

subsided and the freedom from pres
sure of that stock relieved the general
list from the sympathetic sagging ten
dency present since the preferred stock
issue was announced. Weatfler in the
crop regions continued favorable and
the money supply is so ample for all
demands that there is little pressure
upon the market, in the absence of
any positively bad developments.
Southern Pacific made a languid re
covery and then lost practically all of
it Just at the close. Amalgamated
Copper gained a point on the strength
of the reports of recent large sales
of copper, both for domestic and ex
port account.
The very conservative tone of the
mercantile agency views of the metal
trade had a repressive effect on the
speculation in stocks. Computations
of railroad net earnings and cotton
movements, the backward season, the
Colorado labor troubles and wet
weather in the Southwest â all have
had a depressing influence. But it i
Is pointed out that the propor
tion of the average decrease in clear- i
ings is small compared with the sue- I
cessive increases for eight or ten years
past.

each other for that honor. A popular
vote will be cast and during the even
ing: the lucky j-oung lady will be
crowned with all pomp and splendor.

The programme arranged for the
evening will be equally attractive. At
S o'clock e torchlight parade will be

the May Queen and her attendants,
will march to the pavilion, where her
Majesty will be crowned. Following
the coronation the orchestra will play
popular Swedish melodies, the Swedish

tffree months ago I was attacked with that
terrible disease, locomotor ataxia. Power to
balance, stand, or Â«ven sit down, entirely lost.
Two bÂ«st doctors of San Francisco and Hot
Spring.*. Ark., failed to help me. My stom-
ach, bowels and kidneys failed to work. I had
catarrh of stomach, head and bladder as a re-
sult of the dizeaae; these troubles became
chronic. At times rr.y heart would beat like a
drum, my eyes grew weak, my memory bad.
my nerves wrecked. Three months ago I weat
to Tuscan Springs. What happened since wÂ«Â«
a pleasant surprise to mÂ«. Drank the waters,
took the baths â after three weeks' treatment
stomach, bowels, bladder and kidneys ta per-
fect condition, eyeaight perfect, nervousness
gone, memory good. After three months' treat-
ment, walked without a cane, with eye* elosed
and up and down steep hills; am cared of this
dread disease, now walk with slight limp.
Have run stores in seventeen towns of the
State of California: am well known in down-

with rather more than an ordinary
degree of composure and poise which
produces a certain aloofness from the

often characterized by outsiders, espe

to confirm the impression.
If the charges are true-j-and we are

Where Davis Took OatJL
Tehama County also makes claim that it is the second
county in the State in the matter of producing peaches.
Compared with the other fruitful counties of the Sac
ramento Valley it is second for apples and apricots,
third for prunes and pears and seventh for cherries. It
boasts orange, fig, olive, cherry, apricot, peach, pear,
lemon, prune, almond and walnut groves. Flax has
been planted. The climate /is fine. Sunstrokes are un
known. The mean annual temperature is 63 degrees
Fahrenheit.
Tehama County is at the head of the Sacramento
Valley and extends from the Coast Range Mountains
on the west to the summit of the Sierra Nevada on
the east. It has an area of 2.000,000 acres. The agri
cultural lands are estimated to include 700.000 acres,
while 800,000 acres are grazing and "500,000 timber or
forest lands. The scenery is fine. Mount Shasta and the
Lassen Butte are in view. Through the county runs
the Sacramento River and numerous tributary streams.
Springs are abundant on the hillsides. The People's
Cause says that with a moderate outlay of capital all
of Western Tehama can secure an ample water supply
during the entire year. Nature has supplied an abun
dance of water and only enterprise is required to save
and utilize 'it.
In the eastern portion of the county are Antelope,
Mill, Deer and Pine creeks; in the western portion
are Cottonwood, Reeds, Elder, Thomes and Stony
creeks. The average rainfall for ten years at Tehama,
according to Professor Hilgard of the University of
California, has been twenty-six inches. Something like
10,000,000 feet of lumber is annually sold. Tehama pro
duces more than 1,000,000 pounds of wool per annum.
T.he stock cattle are assessed at $391,500 and the thor
oughbred and common cows are estimated to be worth
more than $60,000. The value of Tehama County sheep
was estimated at $548,000 last year for assessment pur
poses. '
These are some of the facts mentioned by the Peo
ple's Cause. Other leading statements are that there
are in the county 1,200,835 fruit trees, of which 918,000
are in bearing. The fruit crop brings to Tehama
County more than $1,000,000 each year. Altogether, a
strong fc showing is reliably made for Tehama. Its popu
lation will have to be increased many fold before its
fruitful acres will be taxed to provide means of support
for all.
THE diversified interests and advancement of Te
hama'County, as they are described and set forth
by the People's Cause in a special edition, are.
truly remarkable. It is a land where the almond and
the walnut grow luxuriantly; where oranges ripen sev
eral weeks earlier than they do in Southern California;
where, in one colony, there are 11,000 acres devoted to
orchards. There is the turkey producing center of the
State. Wheat, barley, oats, rye and other cereals, citrus
fruits and deciduous fruits of all kinds, berries and
vegetables of every description, cattle raising, wool
growing, the production of grapes, wine making, raisin
curing and lumbering, characterize the county strongly.
An- alfalfa field of 240 acres will be .used to supply feed

When searched by the steward' at
the Detention Hospital for the Insane,
to which place he had been conveyed
at the request of his landlady, some
surprises were forthcoming. He was
completely wrapped about the body
and lower limbs with a coll of insulat
ed copper wire, such as Is used for
electric lighting. In each of his pan
taloons pockets he had wrapped In
rubber bags two glass bulbs encased
In dirty brown paper with a mixture
of bluestone and ground copper added.
To the chief steward he Imparted
the news that he possessed a deep
secret, which would surpass Edison
and all other wizards of the world.
With his secret he would be enabled
to throw light at will upon arty ob
ject he saw fit. It would enable him
to have a light In his room at all
hours, which would scare away spirits,
ghopts and midnight prowlers and for
that matter he could send a shock
through the body of his enemy with
out the fear of detection. All this ex
plained the -wire about his body. That
was part of the invention.

sistance of two men. as the crazy man

was merely the instrument of the Czar and the Holy
Synod. The young assassin promptly committed sui
cide. His motives were patriotic, but his act will cause
the further oppression of his people. The incorpora
tion of a people into a government is not new, but the
brutalities of the Russian method are calculated to
cause such reprisals as that of which Bobrikoff is the
victim. â¢ The treaty should have been left perpetual, as
it was intended to be.
England pursues a course in such cases that Russia
might study to her advantage, if she would study any
thing that makes for humanity, good faith and the rights
of .man. When Scotland entered into a Parliamentary
union with Great Britain its terms and conditions were
framed and adopted in perpetuity. The rights of the
church of Scotland were secured and the commercial
position of Scotland was mapped out and the Scotch
became loyal subjects of Great Britain. Their peers
were recognized and they had representation in the
Commons. England has strictly observed this ordinance
of union. The sovereign of Great Britain agrees In his
coronation oath to maintain it, and its violation would
inflame the Scotch from Cheviot Hills to Pentland Frith.
It Is rather early yet to speculate as
to what terms victor will Impose on
vanquished In the present Russo-Japa
nese war; but. from the enormous in
demnities which have been paid to
end strife between nations In the past,
It would seem to cost little less to stop
war than to wage it.
Throughout the Listory of the world
no country has treated a vanquished
foe so generously as Great Britain;
and there are several Instances on
record In which we have refrained
from enforcing payment of indemni
ties voluntarily undertaken by fallen
adversaries. Indeed, In most cases
England has been content with a ces
sion of territory as the price of peace,
but when any of her subjects have
Buffered Insult or Injury at the hands
of the foe ehe has rightly insisted on
sn indemnity in cash.
Thus, at the conclusion of our war
with China in 1S40, the Celestial Em
pire was compelled to pay us a sum
of Â£5,000,000. A goodly portion of

Since then woe has been upon Finland. The people,
have been beset in all their national ways and customs.
By religion they were mostly Lutherans. The Holy

THE assassination of Bobrikoff, the Russian Gov
ernor of Finland, was an act of folly, as well
as a high crime. It is the direct result of the
brutally repressive measures taken by Russia against
the Finns. But instead of relieving the Finns it will,
no doubt, add weight to the already heavy hand of
.their oppressors.
When was incorporated into the empire of
the Czar a perpetual treaty was made reserving the
ancient rights of the people. , Under this treaty the
Finns were content and their country was the only
part of Russia that was not involved in nihilist plots
and crimes." The present Czar, for reasons that have
never been made known, abrogated the treaty and de
stroyed the rights that existed under it. After that
a policy of suppression was adopted, and the Russianiz
ing of the Finns proceeded by force, of which Bobrikoff
was the representative.

Popular government can only be
carried on by parties. You should at
once become a member of that party
whose principles are nearest to your
own faith. Parties can only succeed
by organization. Mobs never win;
discipline always disperses them. Par
ties are the surrender of the Individ
ual of pet projects and pet purposes
to certain broad, general principles
which he in common with the great
mass of his party believes are essen
tial to good government. No matter
how close the party organization, you
can find a place, because Jt needs
workers. Join at once, if you live in
the country, the club or organization
of your town; if you live in the city,
of your district. Give time and atten
tion to party work. You will find that
you can do it without Interfering with
your work or your profession. A few
evenings in the month, and more dur
ing the campaign, diligently and ef
fectively employed, will give you at
once recognition and standing among
the practical men who manage the
party In every locality. You will soon
become known, your advice and ser
vices required and your influence will
extend from the district to the coun
ty and from the county to the State.
There will be many things in the party
organization which you dislike and
many men whom you detest. You will
find, however, that the leaders have
gained their position both because
they have the indescribable qualities
of leadership and give their time and
minds to politics as a business. â

The druggists of Oakland have appealed to the City
Council for a 'liquor license lower than that demanded
of other sellers of the cup that cheers. The appeal seems
to be based on reason if one tajces into consideration the

whisky is vile enough in character either to be licensed
low or condemned as dangerous.
"Of the cowards that eat my bread

altar of St. Benedict, every school boy
knows. Under threat of excommuni
cating him the church made King
Henry pay a heavy bill of damages
for Instigating that sacrilegious crime.
Becket was canonized and his bones
were deposited In a splendid shrine In
the cathedral, which for three centu
ries continued to be the object of one
of the sxeat pilgrimages of Christen
dom. Then came along another King
Henry, eighth of that name, the much
married monarch, who, caring not a
button for excommunication, quarreled
with the Pope on the question of royal
matrimonial rights and privileges and
determined to set up as head of the
English church himself. He despoiled
Becket's shrine, getting over a score
cartloads of treasure therefrom, erased
his name from the calendar of the
saints and ordered his bones to be
burned and the ashes to be scattered to
the four winds.
Whether this was really done no one
can tell at this day. In 18SS a stone
coffln, with the remains of a skeleton
which some declared to be that of the
martyred Archbishop, was discovered
in the crypt and reburled after careful
examination. A curious mosaic pave
ment still remains In front of fne place
where the shrine stood, and in the
stone steps which lead up to It axe deep
hollows worn by the knees of |Â£ount

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALU
6 HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN, LONDON, June 5.âAmeri
cans who are coming to England this
year, and intend visiting Canterbury,
will be disappointed to hear that build
era have Just begun to eurround the
central tower of the famous cathedral
with a huge scaffolding by which Its
beauties will be completely hidden for
probably many months to come. The
temporary disfigurement Is necessitat
ed, however, by the unsound condition
of this portion of the structure, which
has made its restoration Imperative,
lest the tower should share the fate
of Venice's Campanile. Historically
known as the "Bell Harry" tower, this
crowning achle\-ement of Canterbury's
architect la commonly regarded as the
finest example of the perpendicular
style of church architecture In Eng
land, although the name of its de
signer has not been handed down to
posterity. Its construction was begun
In 1472 and It replaced a former tower
called the "Angel Stepple," a name
bestowed on it because of the gilded
cherub who was perched on the pin
nacle. ,It is 225 feet high and 35 feet
in diameter, but such Is the dignity
and stateliness of the design that It
conveys the Impression of much larger
"dimensions. Q
After Westminster Abbey and St.
Paul"5, Canterbury Cathedral Is the
most highly prized of England's
churches, both for its architectural
beauty and its historic associations.
It originated., it is said. In a church
formerly used by the Roman Chris
tians and which St. Augustine conse
crated under the name of Christ's
Church when he became Archbishop of
Canterbury in 697. Enlarged some 350
years later by Archbishop Odo, it was
totally destroyed by fire In 1067. Arch
bishop Lanfranc rebuilt It, but the
choir was again wholly burned down
in 1174, and to rebuild it a number of
French and English artificers were
summoned. Among the former was
one William of Sens, who turned out to
be a man of real genius, and to him
the work was entrusted. He died, how
ever, in 1178, before the work was fin
ished, but a worthy successor was
found in another William, this time
an Englishman, and to him Is due the
completion of the existing unique and
beautiful choir, the choir transept and
the corona or circular apse, which un
der the name of "Beckefs Crown,"
perpetuates the memory of the famous
Archbishop who was murdered In the
cathedral.

from Greece as the condition of peace,
but by the intervention of the Euro
pean powers he was compelled to ac
cept Just one-fifth of that amount. As
Greece was practically in a state of
bankruptcy. It would have been Impos
sible for that country to have complied
with the original Turkish demands.
In order to secure peace after the
war with Japan eight years ago China
had to pay a considerable sum by way
of Indemnity, though not nearly so
much as the Japanese would have ex
acted If they had been allowed a free
hand. Not liking the Idea of the Celes
tials being despoiled by anybody but
themselves, the Russians Interfered,
and Japan had to be content with the
cession of Formosa and the Pescadores
and the payment of a cash Indemnity
of Â£37,000,000. This money Japan used
in preparing for the struggle by which
she hopes to soon exact an Indemnity
from Russia.â Tit-Bits.
It will be remembered, too, that the
same policy was pursued by : them
when Spain gave up the struggle for
the retention of her colonial posses
sions and sued for peace. In a spirit
of generosity the American republic
agreed to pay over to the Spanish Gov
ernment Â£4,000,000 to compensate the
Spaniards for their territorial losses.
At one time Schleswlg-Holsteln be
longed to Denmark, and Bismarck,
having cast covetous eyes on the har
bor of Kiel, situated in Holsteln, he
caused Jutland to be Invaded by the
Prussians. On his forces being routed
he cunningly inveigled Austria into
supporting him, and the allied troops
proved too strong for their adversaries,
right once more being crushed by
might.
The victors, however, quarreled be
tween themselves as to the disposition
of the spoils, and this gave rise to the
war between Austria and Germany in
1S66. The latter power proved victori
ous, and insisted on the Austrians pay-
Ing as war indemnity a sum that, with
the amounts levied on the five small
states that helped them, reached near
ly Â£0,500,000.
But that did not anything like ap
proach the severity with which Bis
marck treated the French at the con
clusion of the Franco-Prussian War of
1S70-7L In the Â£200,000,000 which he
exacted as indemnity, he compelled
Frtmce to pay the dearest price that
any nation ever paid for peace, and a
price that astonished the world. It
was thought that the infliction cf this
enormous fine would cripple France
forever, but, largely owing to the pa
triotism of the thrifty French peas
ants, the money was actually paid be
fore the final installment fell due.
Although this sum exceeded by very
many millions what the Germans had
spent on the war. they and the wily
Bismarck never ceased to regret that
they did not make it double. Consider
ing that France, had to sacrifice two of
her fairest provinces in addition, Ger
many made an unprecedented and
enormous profit as the result of the
conclusion of peace.
When Russia administered a crush
ing defeat on Turkey, after suffering
severe reverses herself, in the struggle
of 1S77, she consented to accept the
sum of Â£32,000,000 as the price of peace,
after demanding a much larger
amount. This was little more than the
actual cost of the campaign, and the
victors would not entertain any lower
terms, as the damage inflicted by the
war on their subjects and commerce
was such as to fully equal those fig
ures,, large though they were. So far
Turkey has paid little more than half
of the indemnity, and there Is not much
likelihood of Russia ever receiving the
full amount.
As an expanding nation the United
States has, like our own, been satis
fied with a grant of territory in each
of the one or two wars she has waged
ond from which she has emerged vic
torious. In fact, at the conclusion of
the war with Mexico, which arose out
of the annexation of Texas, the Yan
kees paid to the Mexicans Â£3,000,000
as consideration for the territory an
npxed.
this Indemnity was paid over to Brit
ish merchants by way of compensa
tion for the destruction of their prop
erty by the Chinese. Considering that
the war cost us considerably over
Â£2,000,000, it cannot be described as
a very profitable bargain.
To close our second war with China,
that country had to pay Great Britain
an indemnity of Â£2,000,000; but as for
each sovereign we received three and
a .half had been' expended in hostili
ties, it is easy to see which nation got
the better of that barg.-ln.
When the missions entered California, more than a
century ago, this Mooresque style came with them and
seemed fitted to the hot and dry locations of the first
mission stations in Southern California. The mission
churches were surrounded by the adobe houses, both
fitted to physical conditions. Another reason seemed
tc dictate the use of both styles. The thick walls were
some protection against earthquakes. There is a cer
tain romance about the mission style, but its adaptation
to modern sanitary needs in such localities as San Fran
cisco and other cool climate cities on the coast is. diffi
cult. Its inadaptation even to the purposes of church
buildings is proved by the fact that it is not used in
our modern churches. The old mission churches stand,
some in ruins and some in restoration^ as interesting
monuments, but we Build them no more, just as we
have ceased to build adobe houses.
In this city especially, the mission style for school
houses is objectionable. Such buildings lack light and
ventilation. In school buildings especial attention
should be given-to orientation. The amount and direc
tion of light should be adapted to the preservation of
the eyesight of pupils, and to their health and to that
of the teachers. People spend only an hour a week in
churches, and light and ventilation may be neglected
there without serious injury. But the whole physical
future of children and teachers is affected by the condi
tion of buildings in which they spend five hours of every
school day in the year.
A schoolhouse should have open and ample space
all around it. and if it do not stand four square to
the points of the compass so much "the better, as the
sun may then shine for part of the day in every room.
It is easy to provide for the temporary exclusion of
flic sunshine, if that be desirable, but its effect for part
of the time upon the interior of schoolroom is the
surest guarantee of the health of the inmates. Given
a schoolhouse permanently shaded on three sides with
rooms that never get the direct rays of the sun and
there is a condition that produces anaemic and un
wholesome conditions of health in pupils and teachers.
This is a country of schoolhouses. The perpetuity
of our institutions in the last analysis depends upon the
work that is done in the schools. Not only must we
look to the schools for minds properly trained for the
high duties of citizenship, but for bodies unimpaired in
that strength which must bear the burdens of that citi
zenship. Hence, the location and the architecture of
school buildings acquire first importance. The school
house should be the best building in a city in the
adaptation of its architecture to secure the health and
the highest physical efficiency of the pupils. All these
things have been studied out and are the development
of experience. The necessities of school architecture are
well known and require abundance of light and the seat
ing of pupils so that it shall reach them from the right
direction and the right angle, so that the sunshine shall
not harm the vision and shall also perform its proper
depurating function.
The mission style is essentially gloomy as to its ex
terior. We say this without denying its picturesque
effect in a proper location. We have nursed the
romance that is around our ancient mission buildings.
But we go to look upon them as historical monuments,
the memorials of a brave and pious past, but with no
desire to live in them. They are to us what the old
and ruined abbeys areMo England. Ivy, on thick walls
is an impressive but not cheerful spectacle. We don't
want its dampness in our houses.
The new school buildings in this city should have
air space around them, they should be of the modern
metal frame style and the material used should be of
light and cheerful color. They should not have many
stories. We doubt whether any schoolhouse should be
more than two stories in height. The climbing of long
flights of stairs is not good for teachers or pupils. The
floor of the first story should be far enough iabove the
basement to secure dryness and one flight above that
is enough climbing. A tall building implies greater
danger in a fire or panic. Two-story houses, with
ample exits and wide stairs, secure the conditions of
safety that must never be lost sight of in large cities.
.We believe that in respect to cost, convenience, sani
tation and safety the well settled styles of school archi
tecture have the advantage over the unsuited mission
architecture. â¢>
THE proposition to build all the new schoolhouses
in this city in the mission style of architecture
is very properly opposed by the local architects.
That style of architecture* was '.introduced into Spain
by the Moors. It is suited to the hot and dry" country
in which the Moors originated. It is, in fact, an evo
lution of the adobe, the sun-dried bricks that were
mixed with straw, and by thick walls and deeply em
brasured windows shut out the hot sunshine of North
Africa.

The failure of the Retail Grocers'
Protective Union and- the Retail
Grocers' Association to fulfill an
agreement of April 7. 1903. to merge
the two bodies into one organization,
to be called the San Francisco Retail
Grocers, is the basis of a suit brought
yesterday in the Superior Court by J.
G. Florence to secure the payment of
$760. Florence says that he brings
the suit for the benefit of the Protec
tive Union and the defendants are H.
G. Lackmann, J. T. Hurley and several
others.
Florence alleges that the Protective
Union deposited $250 to be used for
the entertainment of the National
Convention of Retail Grocers, recently
held here; that the money was turned
over by Daniel Keefe, trustee, to the
defendants, but was never used for
the purposes intended, and that on May
6. If 03, the two organizations held a
Joint picnic, the proceeds of which
âmounted to $1000. The Protective
Union demanded its share, $500, from
the defendants, but this sum has not
been paid. Hence the suit for $750
and interest. : â¢

Chretien's Name In Court.
Attorney Brady made a motion be
fore Judge Dunne yesterday on be
half of Convict John M. Chretien to
strike off the reserve calendar a
charge of obtaining money by false
pretenses. The Judge took the mat
ter under advisement- Chretien has
been employed in the Warden's of
fice at Ean Quentin, but has recently
been put to work in the Jute mill, as
it was alleged he -had forged a con
vict's name to a check for $50.
William H. Jordan, meat inspector,
secured a warrant yesterday for the
arrest of Philip Deller, a butcher at
Colma, on the charge of selling taint
ed meat. Jordan says he went to Ben

street on Friday and discovered the
carcass of a cow which was badly
tainted. He seized it and demanded
where lt came from. He was In
formed that it had been purchased
from. Deller.
Arrested for Selling Bad Meat-
Disregarding the conventionalities
that usually attend marriage ceremo
nies and refraining from even notifying
their friends and relatives of their In
tentions, William L. McGulre. a widely
known young attorney of Hanford, and
Miss Maybell Agee, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. William Agee, prominent res
idents of Stockton, were quietly mar
ried In this city yesterday. The cere
mony was performed by Archbishop
Montgomery at his residence, and Im
mediately after the happy youngcouple
â¢^rent to the Palace Hotel, there to ar
range for an extended bridal tour.
The first Intimation McGulre's friends
received of his marriage was when he
visited the Palace with his bride and
quietly registered. Later in the day the
couple dispatched to the bride's parents
in Stockton the first news of their wed
ding, and while waiting for a response
and the expected parental blessing the
husband wired his own relatives of bis
nuptial event.
Mrs. McGulre is a handsome brunette,
who was reared in Kings County, where
she first met her husband during a visit
there. It was a love match from the
start, and when the young lady re
turned to the present home of her
parents In Stockton, McGulre persisted
In his wooing until the fair maiden had
pledged her heart to him. Recently she
Journeyed to the south again to visit
an aunt, and while there she and her
future husband agreed upon an early
marriage and made their plans accord
ingly. Two days ago young McGulre
came to this city, and his bride followed
later, arriving here yesterday in time
to fulfill the important engagement.
Attorney McGulre was among the
first students to enter Stanford Univer
sity, and on leaving that institution
went to Hanford to practice lawr. He Is
the legal adviser of a number of oil
companies there and in Coallnga. He
is also a United States Court Commis
sioner for Southern California, but
spends a great deal of his time in this
city, where he is a member of several
clubs and enjoys a large circle of ac
quaintances.

Lou Lee was charged v with firing a
shot at Kum Chin in Baker alley on
March 29, and Lou Sing with firing a
shot at Louie Poy at the same time
and place. They belonged to rival
tongs and each claimed that the other
fired the shots.
The Judge reserved his decision on
the motion to dismiss the Lou Sing case
till June 25.
When the case of Lou Sing, charged
Â¦with assault to murder, was called- In
Judge Dunne's court yesterday to be
set for trial a motion was made by At
torney Frank O. Drury to dismiss lt
on the ground thai a Jury in the case
of Lou Lee, tried on aislmilar charge
on Thursday, had brought in a verdict
of acquittal.
The Judge said he was disgusted with
Chinese cases and he sincerely hoped
that no more would be assigned to his
court "A number of witnesses," said
the Judge, "swear one way and a num
ber the other way, and each side can
get white witnesses to bear out the
statements of the Chinese. These for
eigners come to this country and have
no respect for our laws. I have no fault
to find with the verdict of the jury in
the Lou Lee case, but I cannot help
commenting on the fact that several
policemen came 'into court and testified
that the character of the complaining
witness was bad. It seems to me
strange that peace officers would do
such a thing. I do not want any more
of these cases In this court."

To-day will witness a sight not
duplicated elsewhere in America.
From fifty miles away, from down the
valley and up from it, from over the
mountains blue-rimmed in the dis
tance will come horsemen and rigs of
all descriptions, bearing down upon
the mission to celebrate in old Span
ish fashion the natal day of the patron
saint. And as I recall the scene last
year it brings to mind, a picture of
the mission in its prime, when gray
clouds of dust in the distance told of a
wayfarer seeking hospitality â and
what he sought for always found, for
in all the wide world there was no
hospitality like unto that of the
halcyon days of the mission's pros
perity.
MASS ONCE A YEAR. .
Since the death of Father Ambris
in 1880, the last custodian of the mis
sion, mass has been said there only on
this day. As the years wore on time
dealt hard with the church, assisted
ably by vandals, who tore from the
sacred structure its massive doors, its
pulpit and its hand-carved altar rails
when the restraining hand of good old
; Father Ambris was stilled. And for
many years â ever, since the roof fell
in â the service has been held in the
vc tibule, where a rude altar was built
by loving hands. Thither the ojd
statue of St. Anthony is reverently
borne and blossoms from the patio
gathered to grace the shrine. Here, at
this crude altar. Father Garriga sings
the mass and is answered by Antonio
Gomez, a man of some 60 years, who
has served as acolyte in the mission
since his early youth.
The service over, the fun begins.
The river bed, cool and shady, beckons
the people thither. Soon snowy cloths
are spread, baskets dispossessed of
good things to eat and drink and the
feast is on. Songs are rising from
every group, guitars are tinkling mer
rily, and the days before the gringo
came are with us once more.
What a sweet perfume that pastoral
picture wafted to us of the busy city.
That is life!
GRAVES OF THE FOUNDERS.
It is not generally known that with
in the ruined chapel lie the graves of
the foundersâ of all save the saintly
Serra, who rests In San Carlos de Bor
romeo, in Monterey.
When the league set to work to clear
the debris from the church â and tons
of it there wasâ the sepulchres of the
priest-pione'ers were disclosed.' In fact,
evidences of ghoullsm were observed,
after which discovery the Indian la
borers refused to work about the tombs.
The truth of the matter will probably
be revealed to-day, when the Francis
can historian, Father Zephryn, and
Father Garriga will make an official ex
amination of the sepulchres.
Here lie the bodies of Fathers Buena
ventura Sitjar, who passed away Sep
tember 3, 1808; Francisco Pujol y Pujol,
who died by poison in 1801, strangely
Last year, when W. D. Shea, the
architect directing the restoration; Jo
seph R. Knowland, the- president of
the Landmarks League, and a pretty
of friends went down to attend the an
nual feast of San Antonio, great were
the lamentations of the people from
the hills and valleys round about be
cause of the lost joys of the unused
well. But through the energies of the
workmen this year its nectar will allay
the thirst of many who drank the first
draught of childhood from its dark re
cesses.

OLD MISSION OF SAN ANTONIO
DE PADUA. WHICH WAS FOUND
ED IN 1771.
To-night we hope to see the mission
once again by moonlightâ the Melrose
Abbey of the West. ,
Here, uncovered.
In the shadow of this ancient sanctuary,
scarred with storms,
I stand In silent reverie. Ton silver bell.
That called the savage unto the fold of Christ,
Hangs as of yore In Its beaten belfry â mute.
At Its sourd In years agone. the day was born;
It called to nvass, to meal, to Held, to horse;
And then the Angelus, that sweet appeal to
heaven
Rose up from simple hearts In this Arcadia.
And once again.
At eventide, its soft and silvery peal
Went rippling over hill and rancherlaâ
A call to rest â to orisons benign â
While tlouds of incense sweet, and hymns
divine
Rolled upward to the great omnipotent, .
In thy silvery gleam. Oh, moon,
A solemn train treads by; with gown of brown.
With cowl and beads, the monks of old
glide by;
Behind them tread the neophytes, with voice*
Attuned to song: but they -as* Into the shadow
And melt away in the doom.
Under these slabs
They lie at restâ at rest from their wearied
toll:
Oh. sacred spotâ where lie these sainted men.
Who of their lives gave allâ gave friends and
home, and tongue,
And e'en the pant's of hunger felt â and
Rinlled â for God?
The spot Is blest, thrice blest â more sacred 'tis
To me, in moonlit hours than proud ca
thedrals â
More near to the man of Nazareth.
Of the last interment the tale is told
among the natives that the beloved
minister had served the devotees of
Soledad Mission for thirty years, suf
fering the pinch of poverty with stoic
heroism, refusing many times to relin
quish a post that was too poor to sup
port him. At last he fell ill and passed
away without even the consolation of
the last sacrament, amid the mournine
of his children, dying, it is said, from
illness brought on from starvation.
Tearfully the Indains he loved so
well fashioned a -bier of pine boughs,
upon which they laid him tenderly, and
with pine torches to light the way over
the mountain trails when darkness
would fall upon them they set out for
San Antonio Mission, eighty miles
away, that their beloved master might
be laid to rest with the blessings of the
church he served so well. By day and
by night they bore the bier over the
narrow mountain passes, arriving at
the mission with their grim burden,
lighted by flaming torches. With sor
rowful hearts they laid him away and
grimly marched back to their desert
huts, rehearsing to this day- his saintly
memory. '

DIES OF STARVATION.
Chairman Stone, at the suggestion of
Senator E. I. Wolf and Judge Dibble,
appointed a committee of three from
the executive committee of the Repub
lican State Central Committee to con
fer with a committee of three from the
State League of Republican Clubs,
heretofore appointed, for the purpose
of arranging for a meeting to ratify
the choice of the Republican National
Convention for President and Vice
President of the United States. The
chairman appointed E. F. Woodward
of Santa Rosa, Frank A. Schmltz and
J. K. Wilson of San Francisco to repre
sent the executive/committee of the
Republican State Central Committee.
State Senator E. . I. Wolfe, Thomas
Rickard of Berkeley and Judge Dibble
of San Francisco will represent the
State League of Republican Clubs in
the conference, which will be held on
next Tuesday afternoon. Then the
date and .place of the fcig ratification
meeting will be determined upon. It
will probably be held in the Alhambra
Theater on the night of July 6, Which
is the fiftieth anniversary of the found
ing of the Republican party.
When Pease withdrew his support of
San Francisco as the center of the con
vention the blank in the official call of
the Republican State Central Commit
tee was filled with the name of Santa
Cruz and the date was set for Thurs
day afternoon, August 25, at 2 o'clock.
At the opening of the meeting Judge
Dibble of San Francisco introduced a
customary motion that twenty-one
members of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee shall constitute a quo
rum for the transaction of business,
which was unanimously adopted. Fol
lowing this Jacob Shaen was selected
to act temporarily as assistant secre
tary in place of Jacob Steppacher, who
is piloting . the Republican delegation
to the national convention.
Then came the selection of Santa
Cruz, after Krpn and McPherson had
promised the committee that the dele
gates would have all the comforts of
home. . -
RATIFICATION COMMITTEE.
OFFICIAL CALL.
The discussion over the selection of
a place for th$ delegates to the con
vention was carried on by H. F. Kron,
the member of the central committee
from Santa Cruz; Duncan McPherson,
the veteran editor of the Santa Cruz
Sentinel, who attended on a proxy
from John W. Woods and bore an in
dorsement from the Mayor and all of
the citizens of his town for the prom
ises of hospitality that he made, and
Senator Davis of Amador, who stated
that his second for the meeting cf the
Republican delegates at Santa Cruz
was dictated largf" ' as a recompense
to her citizens, for the unruly mob of
Democrats who lately infested her pre
cincts. He thought that the State of
California owed to Santa Cruz the
spectacle of, an orderly State conven
tion In the pursuit of its political pur
poses.
Santa Cruz, the beautiful 'little city
that is whispered to by the waves of
the Pacific and bowed to by the pines
on the mountains at her back, will be
the scene of the Republican State Con
vention. This was determined at a
meeting of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee held yesterday after
noon in the maple room of the Palace
Hotel. San Francisco, through E. R.
Pease, a member from the Thirty-fifth
Assembly District, was put in nomina
tion for the honor of entertaining the
delegates to the Republican State Con
vention. Before the discussion had
proceeded far, he withdrew his motion,
leaving W) ofher municipal aspirant
for the place of the convention other
than Santa Cruz, which was awarded
the trophy by unanimous vote of the
committee.
This famous old mission was five
years old at the birth of our nation-
It was founded July 14, 1771, by
Frays Junipero Serra, the well be
loved father of the West, and Buena
ventura Sltjar. the latter living in his
tory es the compiler of a dictionary
of the Indian languages then spoken
round about the mission.
The fertile fields dotted over with
liveoaks were carefully tiled; aque
ducts built, which are to-day in sound
condition; the chapel, with its adjoin
ing residential quarters, was erected;
workshops were scattered about the
indosure; a mill was constructed,
which stands weed-grown by the tan
ning vats â all withstanding the rav
ages of a century in mute testimony
of thÂ« love labor of the sons of St.
Francis in the western wilderness. It
Is these things that the Landmarks
League seeks to save, these things
that uplift men's fouls, for the man
does not live who could stand in the
rnldst of these things unmoved to re
flection.
FRIARS LOSE POSSESSION.
The tragedy of secularization threw
its black shadow over fair San An
tonio, as at all the missions, save
Santa Barbara, wrenching from the
good old friars the possessions they
had gathered ,for the care of their
Indian children and turning their
charges adrift. Having lived in com
munity for a half century, perform
ing their labors under direction of th<Â»
padres, each for the good of all, and
obtaining their food, clothing and
shelter from the community fund thus
created, what could be expected but
that they fall helpless by the wayside
When turned adrift?
The possessions of the mission, what
of them? Well, 'tis a long tale, and
not o'er pleasant telling. Cupidity,
lying, bribing and Shylocking might
Eilhouette the tale. To-day the mis-
Eion's once thousands of fertile acres
have dwindled to thirty-threeâ Â«ven
the noria, or famous mission well, ly
ing beyond the boundary line. How
ever, as it lies In the Atherten-
Macondray rancho, it is believed that
the owners will deed back to the mis
sion this historic, stone-lined well,
which was left out of the survey at
the request of a squatter, whose house
was built over It By way of extenua
tion, I would add that the surveyor
was much In love Â¦with the squatter's
fair daughter, and to win the senorita
he must first win the senor â therefore
the wriggle in the boundary line.
And far be it from us to blame him!
And by the way, one of the first
duties that the Landmarks League set
itself was to clear out this old noria,
By LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
At the foot of the Santa Lucia, on
the willow-walled banks of the San
Antonio, lies the beautiful old mission
of San Antonio de Padua, with its
ruined olive orchard. Its tile-walled
city of the dead and its arched corri
dors, long untrodden by the devotee,
save at the yearly service within the
ruined chapel in honor of the good St.
Anthony. It is to attend this cere
mony that for 132 years has been held
unremittingly in this sacred Epot that
members of the California Landmarks
League and lovers of the old sanctu
ary journeyed yesterday to King City,
thence by team to Jolon, the old-time
stage coach station, and on to the mis
sion at sunrise this morning. Why at
sunrise? Because the mission is never
so appealing as then, wrapped in the
gray folds of morning, the Santa Lu
cia rising behind it like a great white
specter. And as the sun rises the

When the name of Thomas F. Casey
of the Thirty-seventh was read Frank
Gould jumped to his feet and said his
signature to that certificate was a for
gery. M. F. Tarpey had a proxy
from Casey. Gould moved that Casey's
name be stricken from the roll, but
Murphy was not striking anything but
the table with his jackknife. Casey
was voted every time Tarpey had a
chance to answer to his name.
L. H. Mooser declined to address
Murphy as chairman and Insisted upon
going ahead with the election of a tem
porary chairman and when Murphy or
dered him to take his seat Mooser de
fied him and said he would take or-
When the Forty-ninth District was
reached, the name of J. C. Bullock was
read and that immediately brought
Warren Olney Jr. to his feet with a
charge that the list had been tamper
ed with, as his name should have been
read in place of Bullock's, as he was
regularly elected by the Santa Cruz
convention and Bullock was not. There
was such a hubbub that Murphy had
to take his jackknife from his pocket
and pound holes In the table to get
order. Bullock said Olney's name had
been substituted for his after he left
the convention hall and that he was
the man the delegation Intended to
elect. Murphy ruled .that names rati
fied by the convention were the only
ones which would be recognized and
upon the showing made by Olney his
name was substituted for that of Bul
lock. l ! -
Curtis Hillyer had also been elected
a member of . the committee but his
name was not on the roll. Murphy
would not recognize his request to
place his name among the faithful and
later it was demonstrated that McNab
had captured the convention.
GOULD CHARGES FORGERY.
OLNEY DOWNS BULLOCK.
Geary also read .from the code and
said there should be certificates from
the chairman and secretary of the
Santa Cruz convention showing who
had been elected members of the com
mittee, but as nearly as he could get
at It there were no such certificates
present.
Murphy ruled that the code did not
apply in the present instance and then
it looked as though there would be an
old fashioned Democratic rough-house.
Murphy said It had been the custom
for retiring chairmen to call the new
committee together and he had follow
ed custom as he did not believe tha
code applied.
Half the commltteemen were on
their feet in an instant, but Geary se
cured the floor and shouted that ho
did net recognize Murphy's right to
preside as chairman. He demanded
that a certified list of the committee
be produced before any other business
be transacted. Murphy refused to give
way and ordered Alexander McCabe
to call the roll. J. C. Ruddock of Mea
doclno wanted a correct list, but the
roll call continued.

The Hearst forces met defeat in cha- |
grin and surprise at the hands of .Gavin !
McNab in the Democratic State Central
Committee yesterday afternoon. So
confident of victory were the followers
of Hearst under the leadership of M. F.
Tarpey that they flaunted the picture
of M. F. Cochrane in the Hearst San
Francisco paper yesterday morning, at
taching this caption to the illustration:
"M. F. Cochrane of Marin, who will to
day be elected chairman of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee." Mr.
Cochrane is a good Democrat and a
resident of the excellent county of
Marin. A, daily paper may lose nothing
â¢ in the field of embellishment by pre
senting his picture to its readers on the
merit of his individuality, but, never
theless, devotion to accuracy requires
the statement that T. M. Spellacv of
the county of Kern was elected chair
i man of the Democratic committee. The
Kern County man was Gavin McNab's
candidate. On the outside slate the
name of William J. McGee was writ
ten, but the name penciled on the true
inside. slate by the crafty McNab was
that of Tim Spellacy of Kern.
Cohorts of the intrepid Tarpey and
henchmen of the valorous McNab as
sembled at the California Hotel at the
time appointed for the alignment. At
tached to the Tarpey staff were such
able lieutenants as D. M. Delmas and
Harry Creswell. While Barney Muijphy
was pondering over points of order
raised by the active McNabites, sen
tences of the great nominating speech
at the St. Louis convention were tak
ing ornate finish in the Delmas mind.
Gavin McNab's immediate aids on
the scene of conflict were Thomas J.
Geary and Frank H. Gould. Dauntless
youngsters like Warren Olney Jr. and
Curtis Hillyer could not be restrained
in their ardor to support McNab. Liv
ingston Jenks, once a trusted adviser
of the' '"organization," lined up yester
day with the Hearst forces. Perhaps
the change of base was due to the per
suasive J. H. O'Brien, who yesterday
had the presence of mind in the midst
of defeat' to move that the State con
vention of the party be held in Santa
Cruz. . â¢'
PROXIES IN* AMBUSH.
Experts who were detailed to observe
the battle and note the points of strat
egy displayed by either side maintain
that Tarpey. was outgeneraled.- He un
derestimated the strength of his ad
versary. In counting proxies he took
into account only those filed with the
secretary. He did not reckon that Mc-
Nab had a battalion of proxies in am
bush. The crafty Scot filed in advance
some of his Interior proxies, but others,
concealed* up his sleeve, were not dis
closed until after the call of the roll
had begun. . V-V
. The McNab majority was very
slight. In preliminary skirmishing he
gained two votes. Hillyer and Olney,
whose names had not been placed on
the roll, were enrolled. The test vote
resulted Spellacy 68, Cochrane 61.
-i McNab was not ratisfled with the
capture of the chairmanship. He
Ex-Chairman Barney D. Murphy
read the call and asked that all prox
ies be handed in to the secretary. The j
question arose as to the nomination .â¢
of chairman and George E. Faw start- ,
ed to address the committee when j
Frank Gould raised a point of order on |
the ground that the committee had not |
been legally called together. To sus- j
tain that point he read from the code
to show that the powers of the old
committee had ceased at the adjourn
ment of the Santa Cruz convention and |
that Senator Murphy had no authority i
to act in the matter. Inasmuch as
the meeting had been called, however, J
he (Gould), as chairman of the con
vention, would ra*'*y the action. He
contended that the first thing would
be the election of a temporary chair- '
man of the committee. Murphy re- j
fused to accept the motion and the i
jangle began.- :
Thomas J. Geary also raised a point
of order and said the meeting was very
important and the committee should
work according to the code. He be- '
lieved a right start should be made
so as to prevent any possibility of a
technicality being raised by the oppo
sition and thereby injuring the chances
of "carrying the State by a 'narrow J
margin." I
MURPHY TAKES THE GAVEL.
At Santa Cruz August 22, In the af
ternoon. Democrats will again meet
and Jim O'Brien will be there to vex
the soul of Gavin McNab. Tarpey
may be there also. It is within the
range of political possibility that the
defeated and disgruntled elements of
the Democratic party will unite and
smash the McNab machine. Presi
dential Electors and candidates for
Congress will be nominated at Santa
Cruz. The whole week at the seaside
will be given up to politics. The
Democrats will probably adjourn on
the 23d and the Republicans will as
semble on the 25 th of August.
In the speeches commending Spel
lacy as the right man to lead the com
mittee in the State compaign mention
was made of his great wealth and
generous devotion to the principles of
the party. . After Spellacy's election
and just before adjournment a sug
gestion was made to assess each mem
ber of the committee to the amount
of $20, but the suggestion was not
pressed to a vote. There Is an im
pression that Spellacy is an angel
from Kern who will some time in the
dim and misty future take his place
with the Democratic .cherubim, along
with Jim Phelan and Jim Coleman.
wanted the works complete and car
ried his point by ousting AI McCabe
from the position of secretary and in
stalling Thomas J. Walsh, who was
Registrar of Voters lunder the Phelan
regime. .
The Democrats of the Hearst camp
are sullen and sore. The sorest of all
are the Marin County Democrats, who
worship at the shrine of Cochrane.
The knives that are being sharpened
in Marin for Congressman Bell of the
Second District will cut wide and
deep. In the Cochrane councils last
night the remark was made, "We had
a right to expect fair treatment, but
we got the knife from York, the law
partner of Congressman Bell. York
sat in the committee and voted against
Marin's condidate. Yes, Napa of our
own Congressional district went
against us."

IMMENSE CROWD PRESENT.
Any bets that were made were
handled secretly. It was a pencil mark
on the cuff or a scrawl on a pro
gramme. Usually the betting was
transacted by signals. This system,
however, went only for the big bettors.
As for the man "of limited means, there
was no chance for him to-day, and as
a result he saved his money. The ab
sence of betting did not detract from
tbe race itself, nor from the crowd.
Ppectators perhaps were less numerous
l!an last year, when it was estimated
that 60,000 persons passed through the
gates. To-day about 10,000 or 15,000
less saw the race. It was, however, the
same riot of color on the lawns, club
bouse steps and in the infield. Tally
hos, drags and other splendid turnouts
were there in force, and the cheering
was Just as lusty at the finish.
The victory of the Eastern colt was
popular, despite the number of backers
who had pinned their faith in the win
ter books on English Lad, Moharib and
BUI Curtis.
Fuller, who had the mount on the
winner, rode a magnificent race. High
ball was well within himself all the
way, and when challenged in the
stretch he had plenty to fall back on.
Out of the 193 original nominations
for the race sixteen faced . the barrier
to-day. Ralnland and Proofreader, two
of last night's entries, were scratched,
and Mayor David S. Rose and Copper
field were added.
BAD ACTORS DELAY START.
Once in the starter's hands "Volney
and Highball kept the man with the
CHICAGO. June 18.â Without feeling
the touch of whip or spur and running
entirely on his own courage, Highball,
the three-year-old colt which W. M.
Scbeftel brought to Chicago from the
East, won the American Derby to-day
at Washington Park. L. B. Dickerson's
Woodson, one of the long shots In the
race, was second, half a length in front
of John A. Drake's Rapid Water. Eng
lish Lad, the favorite before the race,
was fourth, hopelessly beaten, although
he was coming strongly at the end. The
time, 2:33, enuals the best time ever
made for this event. The Picket won
last year's Derby in exactly the same
time. W. M. Scheftel, the owner of the
winner, is a Wall street broker. This
Is the first year he has figured promi
nently on the turf.
For the first time in the history of
the American Derby the betting ring
was without bookmakers. There was
some betting, of course, but It was
without the knowledge of the 300 po
licemen scattered over the grounds, in
command of Assistant Chief of Police
Schuettler. There were policemen
everywhere â in the stand. In the pad
dock. In the betting ring, on the lawn
and In the fleld. Private detectives
made up the rest of the army of 800
that was at the track to enforce the
law and prevent bettinp. None, how
ever, was necessary, as ihere was prac
tically no attempt to violate the law.
Woodson was half a length In front
of Rapid Water, the latter being
three-quarters of a length ahead of
English Lad. Moharib was a distant
fifth. The remainder of the field was
badly strung out.
The race had a gross value of $31,-
flag busv and the field was held at. the
barrier eleven minutes. With the tape
finally released Proceeds shot to the
front and remained there for a quar
ter of the Journey. The start was
good, but ill luck befell some of, the
horses before half a furlong had been
traversed. English Lad got in a pocket
and was compelled to .pull up. In
doing so the favorite fell to his knees,
only to recover his stride and to be
bumped again. In this Jam Bill Cur
tis was badly cut down, and his owner
after the race said that he might
never race agaiiv Fort Hunter, the
Canadian colt, was blamed for the In
terference. This colt had a hard
Journey also, getting into a pocket,
then working free, and leading for a
short time. These quick changes set
tled anv chance he might have had to
win the race. Proceeds retained the
lead until opposite the clubhouse,
where he commenced to fall back. All
this time Fuller, on Highball, had
rated his mount about two lengths be
hind, but always in call of the leader.
Rapid Water, running easily, hung on
in third place until the sixth furlong
post had been passed. English Lad.
after getting off sixth, soon fell back
to thirteenth place and remained
there for more than two furlongs.
Dominick gradually worked the fa
vorite through the field in front of
him, only to find himself cut oft" again.
Moharib, next to English Lad the most
he.'V^ily backed horse in the race, was
more or less interfered with.
PACE TOO FAST FOR MOHARIB.
Jockey Shaw, who had the mount
on Moharib. avoided the crush around
the turns and was third into the
stretch, but the pace was too fast for
him when the finish came. The same
applies to Fort Hunter. In the mean
time Proceeds had set the field a
merry race, with Hishball and Rapid
Water in attendance. On the back
stretch Proceeds faded away t6 noth
ing, whlla Highball moved up and
took command. The 'remainder of the
field had no chance and were strung 1
out for an eishth of a mile.- Moharib
hung on gamely. Rapid Waftr for an
instant fell back, but came again and
headed Woodson.. The* latter came
with a fine burst of sneed at the
close and finished half a\"lens:th in
front of Rapid Water. English Lad,
who had found clear sailing at last,
started after the leaders .with Dorrii
nlck working with might and main.
In the meantime Fuller, on Highball,
skinned the rail, followed by Wood
son. Fuller had Highball well in
hand and' a sixteenth from the wire
had the field thoroughly beaten.
Woodson and Raald Water were
under whip and spur. butyHIghball
kept in front and swept under the
wire a winner by a length and a half.
FIELD BADLY STRUNG OUT.
Meeting discontinued In 1895. 1896, 1307 and 1899
576, of which $26,575 went to the
winner.
Highball's owner was said to be a
heavy winner outside of the value of
the stake. John A. Drake was
credited with winning $18,000 on
Rapid Water to finish in third place.
An offer for a match race between
English Lad and Highball was de
clined by Mr. Scheftel, as he will ship
his stable back to the East next Mon
day. Summary:

Old Stone and Estrada set a hot pace
to the back stretch, where Jack Young
and Bondage commenced their run.
Bondage outstripped .Baker's horse in
the run home. Flying Torpedo was

$4090 to the .winner. Eight starters
faced the' barrier.
Bernays was scratched, as he would

The pace was well sustained even up
to the last.' Delhi was beaten four
lengths. St. Valentine, five lengths
away, defeated Ormonde's Right for
third money, by three-quarters of a
length.
In all his previous races this year,
Delhi has been hard to "place." but
to-day Odom had no great difficulty
in doing that. Then again -when Ort
Wells went up to and passed him in
such short order on the far turn the
people could not trust their eyes. That
Delhi should then have struggled orÂ»
and saved second place Is as much a
tribute to his rider as to his own
merits.
SHEEPSHEAD BAT, June 18.âAl
most coincident with an Eastern colt's
victory in the American Derby, a
Western colt, Ort Wells, defeated the
pride of the East, James R. Keene's
Delhi,, for the $20,000 Tidal stakes at
the Coney Island Jockey Club track
in the presence of an attendance not
much less than that which witnessed
the Suburban.
On the way home from the race* the
people had not yet tired qf talking of
Delhi's defeat and of its probable
cause. There have been reports for
several weeks that he was coughingr.
but he must have got over that or
he could not run the race he did to
day. y{'-.\%
But that the Delhi of to-day Is not
the same one which so easily won the
Belmont, to say nothing of his Withers
victory, the average racegoer of intel
ligence refused to believe. Even in his
action he labored, which he never did
before.

played his usual brilliant driving game

BUTTE, Mont., June 18.â After a
chase of two days through one of the
wildest sections of Montana, during
which time not a trace of the four rob
bers who held up the Northern Pacific
North Coast Limited at Bear Mouth,
Montana, Thursday night could be
found. Sheriff Thompson of Mlssoula
has returned and tha man hunt has
been called off as far as the posses are
concerned.
The railway officials belleva that the
robbery was committed by some one
living in Bear Mouth region and that
the bandits are now ensconsced in some
mountain retreat. Plnkerton men and
secret service men are arriving In this
city en route to Bear Mouth, from
where the railway company plans to
send the sleuths into the mountains.
From the character of the two hold
ups, it Is believed that the lone robber
who held up the North Coast Limited
at Bear Mouth more than a year ago
is the leader of the gang which robbed
tha Limited Thursday night. Abso
lutely no trace was found of the lone
bandit when the first robbery occurred,
and it was then suspected that the rob
ber was some mountaineer.
The express officials still insist that
the sum secured by the robbers was
small, though the stories of reputable
passengers put a different light on the
subject. According to the stories of
the latter the two desperadoes com
fortably filled two saddle bags with
greenbacks and gold and silver coins.
One passenger exhibited fifty debars'
worth of gold coin which he picked up
about the wrecked safe with the aid of
lighted matches. Other passengers dis
played twisted and scratched coins
which the robbers left. There was an
excited scramble among the passengers
and the. train crews when It ' became
known that the robbers had left and
that money was scattered in profusion
about the safe. One man found an en
velope In which were several small dia
monds. Another discovered a package
containing several thousand dollars'
worth of canceled bank notes.
Officers unearthed a cacha of 183
sticks of dynamite within a epaca of
four feet near where the~big Overland
safe was hurled by the explosion.

to prevent the spread of contagious
diseases.

SEATTLE OX THE TOBOGGAN'.
SEATTLE. June 18. â Both Los An
geles ar>d Tacoma won to-day, leaving
them tied for first place in the pennant
race. Seattle seems to have lost the
idea of winning and is going down
the ladder. In the first game of the
present series Seattle outclassed the
champions, but in the last three games
the tables have been turned.
Hughes, Williams, Shields and Bar
ber have not been able to keep the
hits down and In addition the Siwashes
have been doing some poor fielding at
critical points. In to-day's game Gray
kept the hits so well scattered that
Los Angeles won In a walk, although
the score would indicate that the g-ame
yas close.
Shields was wild and retired In place
of Earber in the third inning. Bar
ber pitched a fair game, but the score
was S to 1 when he went in and the
proportion was not changed during the
remainder of the g-ame. Flood played
brilliantly at second. The score:

Murphy dug some more holo3 in ths

that a committee on credentials might

SUMMARY.
PORTLAND, June 18.â "With the
game three allâ Beck was first up In
the last half of the tenth Inning. "Put
it over the fence. Beck!" yelled tha
bleachers, warmed up by a bit of a
squabble between the players and the
umpire. Then they stared with open
mouths, for the first ball pitched was
met square on tha nose. High and
wide It soared and landed somewhere
far beyond the right field fence.
In the last half of tha eighth tha
Portland players swarmed along tha
first base line, bats In hand. Second
Baseman Schlafitey saw the effect of
the movement on his pitcher's nerves
and went wild. Upon Umpire Browns
he poured out the vials of his wrath In
words and gestures that were appall
ing. Schlafley was fined and two offi
cers led him from the grounds.
Then Castro had something to say
that he was Immediately y sorry for.
Browne levied an assessment. Buller
pitched a great game. He had his bad
inning, of course, but when he got on
his feet again his work was as steady

ST. Y1ULX AT HIS BEST
It developed yesterday that Jeffries
never posted his forfeit, which was sup
posed to be in the hands of the stake
bolder. When Harry Pollock learned
this he accused Jeffries of double deal
ing and expressed the belief that the
champion never Intended to fight Mun
roe. The New Yorker did not spare
the champion.
"I don't think Jeffries wants to fight
Munroe." said Pollock yesetrday.
"From what I can see there Is nothing
the matter with Jeffries fighting this
month If hÂ» wanted to. Ho is in bed
here at Harbin Springs, but I don't
think he need stay there, as far as his
injured knee Is concerned. I do not see
where we will get anything out of this,
as Jeffries did not post his forfeit.
Ours was up in the hands of the stake
holder. I have given Jeffries until Mon
day to post a $5000 forfeit If this
money Is not put up I will start East
The Jeffries-Munroe fight has been
postponed again, this time until the
last week in August. This was the out
come of the conference at Harbin
Springs yesterday, in which Managers
Coffroth and Pollock participated with
Jeffries.
The advance sale of seats for the
fight amounted to $6000. This money
will be refunded to-morrow after 1 p.
m. at the office of the Yosemlto Club,
room 17, Columbian building.
It was Manager Coffroth who Insisted
on the men not fighting other opponents
until they meet In the ring In August.
The fight will be promoted by the Shas
ta Club. Its first and only venture Into
the puglllstlo field was the bout be
tween MoVey and Johnson.
Manager Coffroth said last night that
the matter had not been discussed as
to whether Jeffries would recompense
the club and Munroe for the money
they ara out. The club has epent a lot
of money for advertising. Munroe has
also been under big expense, keeping up
a big training establishment at the
beach.
Tuesday with Munroe. We have offers
of fights with Jim Corbett, Fltzslm
mons and other heavy-weights In
which there Is good money. We have
bound Munroe not to tight until he
meets Jeffries."
Jeffries wired his friend, De.Witt Van
Court, yesterday to post hla forfeit of
$5000.

Henry Carr, who is employed at the
Victoria Powder Works, West Berke
ley, had an exciting experience at the
ocean beach on Friday night. He was
strolling along about 10 o'clock when
he was" confronted by three men Just
opposite Sheehan's. Two of them wore
khaki uniforms and one presented a
revolver at Carr's head and gruffly told
him to throw up his hands.
Carr quickly obeyed and another of
the trio went through his pockets, tak
ing his gold watch and $4 25 in silver.
Then they reviled him for having so
little money and made him take off
his coat and vest and hat, which they
carried away with them. Carr hunted
for a policeman and met T. J. Dugan,
to whom he told his experience. Frank
H. Norman, clerk to the Chief of Po
lice, and Policeman Cavanaugh hap
pened along and also listened to Carr's
tale. They Joined Dugan in a search
for the footpads, without success. Carr
gave a good description of the trio.

ENLISTED MEN MAKE GOOD
SHOWING ON RIFLE RANGE
LOITER BY THE SEA AND III HILLS
Batteries B and C. First Artillery,
Captains Gratton and Petty, will en
gage in target practice to-day at the
range of Company D of the Fifth at
San Rafael.
; The date for the encampment of the
j Guard of this State has been set for
! August 13. Beyond that nothing has
j been given out. None of the commands
j has been advised as to where the men'
are to go into camp.
A number of company commanders
say they are censured In orders if dila
tory in forwarding reports to superior
j headquarters, and they are wondering
I why demands which ought to have
j been received more than two months
j ago have not yet reached company
j headquarters.
Company I of Llvermore has obtained
sufficient ammunition from Sacramento
to enable the members to engage in
target practice at the th'ree distances.
YThe long-expected belts for the men
of the guard are coming. The required
number has been issued to the First
Infantry and to the First Artillery. The
other regiments are stilf waiting for
them.
Company B of the Fifth Infantry
went to a point near Los Gatos last
evening, where it bivouacked for the
night. To-day, under command of Cap
tain Holton and Lieutenants Farrell
and Steves, there will be guard duty
and drill in extended orders. In the
afternoon the company will return to
its armory in San Jose. This* is one of
a series of field practice drills in
augurated in the Fifth". This company
has secured ammunition and is now
becoming familiar with" the use of the
Krag-Jorgensen rifle at 200 yards.
NATIONAL GUARD NOTES.
The general says: "In the foregoing
case the record of proceedings shows
many irregularities and omissions,
which lays open both the court and the
Judge advocate to severe censure by the
reviewing authority. The act of allow
ing any one present while the court
was in closed session other than a
member of the court shows an utter
lack of knowledge on the part of the
officers of the court-martial duty, and
Is a serious reflection on the members
of the court Court-martial duty is as
essential as any other military duty,
and all officers should be familiar with
the same, and it is to be regretted that
in the above case the accused should
escape just punishment by reason of
carelessness on the part of the court.
The trial itself and the publication of
the same in orders, while a very mea
ger way of punishing the accused,
should be a sufficient reminder to him
to prevent a repetition of such derelic
tion of duty."
CENSURES COURT.
Some of the members of the National
Guard in the southern part of the State
are unhappy because of a recent order
issued by Brigadier General Wankow
skl disapproving the finding and sen
tence of Captain G. O. Lockwood of the
Seventh Infantry, who was found
guilty of neglect of duty and sentenced
by the court that tried him to be cash
iered. Those concerned in the order re
storing Captain Lockwood to duty, are
Lieutenant Colonel F. L. Reynolds, Ma
jor J. W. A. Off. Major G. E. Lawrence,
Major J. H. Campbell.- Major Truman
Cole, Captain J. E. Sullivan. Captain
W. W. MIdgley, Captain W. D. Collins,
Captain 8. M. Saltmarsh, First Lieu
tenant H. B. Sabine and Captain J. D.

In another safe, where valuable
stones were ruined and Â¦ Qpid jewelry
melted "in lumps, a white*silk hand
kerchiefwas found whole and not In
the least discolored. Theories have
proved valueless in trying to explain
the freaks . of fortune, for when one
circumstance had apparently been
cleared up anotherwas revealed to in
validate the former guess. Just how
Peggy, the â¢ office cat of the United
Elertric Railway Company, came out
of the gutted wreck of the big Conti
nental Trust building -with only a
slight singeing will never be explained.
One is at liberty to take his choice be
tween attributing the escape to Provi
dence, to a- fortunate hiding place, or
âdoubting that Peggy was in the
building. In Baltimore, however, it
amounts to treason to doubt a fire
story. â New Terk Post.
"Several safes which were opened
before they had cooled exploded the
moment air reached the Interior and
set everything within on fire.
"L. C. Matthews of an insurance
firm remembered during the fire that
in the firm's safe, along with valuable
papers, were several boxes of parlor
matches. He made desperate efforts
to reach 4he . strongbox, but failed.
When the safe was opened not a
match had been ignited by the tre
mendous heat, and everything was in
tact."
"Except for less than a score of
pieces, the watches, rings and orna
ments had all melted and run together
in one big lump on the' floor of the
safe. The inside of the heavy doors
was *npt even scorched, and yet every
woodtn drawer in the safe was In
ashes.
"A big safe belonging to the largest
firm of pawnbrokers in Baltimore ap
peared Intact when brought out of the
ruins. It contained 324 gold and sil
ver watches, 200 diamond and other
rings and a lot of miscellaneous gold
and silver ornaments.
As the work of reviving the burned
district of Baltimore goes on curious
little stories crop up showing the ap
parent inconsistency of the flames and
the Btrange'freaks of the wind. It was
a short time after the fire that a farm
er brought to the city 160 pounds of
leaf tobacco. He explained to the pur
chaser of the leaf that he had gath
ered It from his land, seven miles
away, and that he supposed it to be
from a bjg warehouse that burned.
The owner of an oyster pungy that lay
at a dock when the nre began. had the
craft towed into the middle of the
stream when the blaze threatened.
Seven miles down the river the cap
tain found in the stern a bit of black
ened paper, and he was about to brush
it overboard when he noticed its tex
ture. A close examination showed it
to be a charred J100 bill, which he
carefully preserved in a pocketbook.
At the sub-treasury the burnt bill was
redeemed. At Bear Creek, Maryland,
thirty miles from Baltimore, a
scorched postal card with the super
scription-of the Third National Bank
was found.
As showing the action of the heat
on the Iron and steel safes In the vari
ous offices, . these examples, quoted
from the correspondence of the Bos
ton Advertiser, are of interest:
"Felix Sullivan was, overjoyed to see
his big strongbox come up out of the
ruins apparently unhurt, save for the
paint. The combination lock yielded
to his manipulation as easily as ever.
When he swung the dook back, how
ever, he found every scrap of paper
within it reduced to ashes. Even the
bit of Brussels carpet on the floor of
the safe was but charred- wool.

Many who have â¢ been East are
hurrying to Oakland, glad to get back,
on account of the Insupportable heat
beyond the Rockies. Among those
who have recently been welcomed
home are Senator Perkins and Miss
Pansy Perkins. Travel has done much
for Miss Perkins. The schoolgirl who
went away has returned a charming
and attractive young woman. General
and Mrs. Oscar Long are coming to
Oakland for their summer and are
expected here Monday. "Highlands"
Is all agog over the promised home
coming, i
Congressman Victor H. Metcalf and
Mrs. Metcalf are enjoying a visit
home. . .
OAKLAND, June 18. â Oaklanders
are distributing themselves very im
partially among the various resorts,
mountain, valley, or seaside, seeking
any place where the "good old sum
mer.time" may be most agreeably
spent/ But home has its attractions,
too. Never have so many people re
mained in town, making little Satur
day to Monday trips that are really
more satisfactory than a month's so
journ in some fashionable resort,
where one has to dress three or four
times a day and sleep on a hard bed
at night. Those who have their own
country homes are to be envied, for
not only they, but their friends, may
enjoy rusticating comfortably.
Foremost among these fortunate
ones are the Chabots. who entertain
the Jolliest house parties every year at
Villaremi. The E. A. Herons' country
home at Ben Lomond is reallv a
mansion. Near by Dr. and Mrs. Harry
P. Carlton keep open house In a cozy
little bungalow. Mrs. Sumner Bugbee
is spending the summer in her cot
tage at Santa Monica, and Mrs. Sam
Breck is there, also, as her guest. The
H. A. Butters usually entertain large
house parties at "Constantia," their
summer home, but this year they have
rented a cottage at Santa Barbara
and will remain in the south for two
months.

The number of children in San Jose

JURY IN THE HULSE CASE
FINDS COMPROMISE SENTENCE
Pasquier Dies From Injuries Received
by Bursting or Tire on Rapidly
Moving Automobile.
PARIS, June 18.â The ilarqul3
d'Audlfferet Pasquier, son of the Duke
d'Audifferet Pasquier, died to-day at
Brezolles, Department of Eure-et-Loire,
as the result of a motor car accident.
He was 43 years of age. While run
ning at the rate of fifty-six miles an
hour a tire of his car burst and the
vehicle was overturned. The Marquis
was hurled into the air and sustained
Internal Injuries.
DEATH OF 3IARQUIS DUE
TO MOTOR CAR ACCIDENT
Tietz had nothing to say to-day
when sentence was passed upon him.
but was' partially prepared for the
severity of the sentence by the fact
that his having been convicted of a
felony before made the minimum pun
ishment that the court could give ten
years.
Frank Tietz. a convicted chicken
thief, was sentenced to twelve years
in Folsom prison to-day by Judge S.
P. Hall. The severity of the sentence
was due to the fact that he had been
convicted before and Judge Hall in
sentencing him stated that from his
conduct it was evident he had no
thought of reforming.
"Tietz was convicted of burglary in
the first degree. He was caught only
after months of wholesale robbing of
henroosts and the entire district about
Fruitvale had suffered from his depre
dations. His mistake was made in
being unable to distinguish in the dark
between finely bred Brahmas and the
ordinary barnyard fowl. He stole thir
teen prize fowls from John Russell and
sold them to a poultry dealer for $4.
Russell, in search of his birds, recog
nized them. He got an excellent de
scription of the thief, whom the de
tectives soon had in custody.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, June 18.
Police Judge George Samuels de
cided to-day that the $1300 50 taken
from the home of Jose Ferro, 357 A
street, on a eearch warrant secured by
David F. Selby on the suspicion that it
had been stolen from him by Ferro,
should be returned to the latter. His
Honor was unable to determine
whether the coin found in Ferro s
home was the same as that lost by
Selby.
Selby, while on a trip from San
Francisco to this city on June 1. be
came separated i either on the ferry
boat or train from a grip in which 'he
was carrylng~*lÂ«00. Several clews led
him to believe that Ferro and John
Lee, a deckhand on the steamer Pied
mont, were responsible for the disap
pearance of the grip and cash. . Search
warrant proceedings were instituted
and $1300 50 was discovered in Ferro's
house, which he asserted was pension
money that he was keeping for two
children. In giving his decision to-day
Judge Samuels said:
"I am sa tiÂ«nÂ«d from the. evidence
that Selby lost what he affirms he did.
I am also of the opinion that some
person is guilty of grand larceny or
embezzlement but cannot say who.
The property found in Ferro's posses
sion has not been proved to be Selby's.
and it is my duty to order the cash re
turned to Ferro."

As a resalt of the speaking of the
bark Hollisrwood by the schooner TVan
tit, the name of the overdue vessel yes
terday was taken off the reinsurance
list. Nothing more has been heard of
the Hoiliswood. which probably will be
picked uj> by some coasting steamer
and helped to port. Although strong
northwesterly winds have prevailed
since the Hoiliswood was spoken by the
bark Prussia on May 2S, the revenue
cutter Daniel Manning headed north on
Friday, when she started her search
for the missing vessel. Aa the Hollis
wr>od was net anchored and had a
fhort supply of canvas she has been
making southerly way ever since the
Prussia left her and. as was supposed
by everybody bnt the people on the
revenue cutter, is now well to the
southward of this port.

"We spent about two weeks on the
t3thmus. but as it is only forty miles
in width at the point proposed for the
construction of the canal, we had am
ple time to go over the country thor
oughly. We found that a ditch had been
dug clear across the isthmus, but it
is neither of the depth nor width re
quired. Portions of it will, however,
be of use. The commissioners at pres
ent plan a canal 150 feet wide and with
a water depth of 30 feet. The deepest
cut will be through a hill 340 feet in
height. ->,
"We shall be unable to tell what the
elevation of the canal will be until we
receive a report from the enginers now
at work. A corps of eighty men was
sent there, but it will be fully a year
before we can arrive at a direct deci
sion from th,elr figures."
When asked aa to the length of time
it would take to complete the canal
Mr. Grunsky was non-committal.
"An estimate was made by the
French corporation that it would take
eight years," he said, "but as we have
not fully formulated our plans it is
impossible for us'to make an estimate."
Mr. Grunsky says the commissioners
do not anticipate any difficulty in se
curing workmen. The men who were
employed by the French company are
willing to remain and will be given
steady employment. If more are need
ed they may be procured from the same
class, which Includes natives of the
isthmus, negroes from the West In
dies, Italians, and even Americans.
"When we visited the isthmus in
April we found a force of 600 or 700
men at work digging the canal. They
had been employed by the new Panama
Canal Company, which succeeded the
old French concern, and had made a
cut through the highest elevation to
be traversed. Some of the work done
by them will unquestionably be of
great value to us, while other portions
may be entirely useless. We decided,
however, to retain tjne men a nd con
tinue the work on It's present lines un
til a decision is reached regarding the
elevation of the canal.
C. E. Grunsky, formerly city engineer,
but now a member of the Panama
Canal Commission, has returned to this
city for a brief stay after an extended
trip across the continent and to the
isthmus. Mr. Grunsky says that ' a
large force of \nen is at work on the
canal and will be kept there even
though final plans have not been made.
His statement of conditions on the isth
mus and of the purposes of the com
missioners is as follows:

PAUL DESTINE,
The first registered trance clairvoyant and
palmist ever in San Francisco.
Read carefully. An honest proposition.
(You to bÂ» full judge.)
I do hereby solemnly agree and guarantee
to make no charge if I fall to tell your name,
occupation and what you called for: I tell
you if husband, wife or lover Is true or false,
whom and when you will marry, how to gain
the love of tho one you desire: in fact, I will
tell you every hope, fear or ambition better
than you can tell yourself; his advice Is re-
liable, his powers are wonderful and Indis-
putable: he Improves your character so that
you will reach the highest possible develop-
ment In mental a=d bodily vigor, health,
happiness and capacity to earn wealth: the
controlling power implanted in your nature,
so you can control any one secretly: gives
advice on mining and buried treasure; gives
you success In life: he guarantees you suc-

FROM ALL SECTIONS THEY COME TO
WITNESS THE WONDERFUL DEMON-

For a reliable and Intelligent clairvoyant
reading go to LIVINGSTONE. 428 Eddy St.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
Â¦what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROFESSOR
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling' you, find the cause of trouble ' and
surcest the remedy.
He is as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he Is for hi* original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness.
Would It not be a relief to know how you
will gucceed. to be relieved of the matters that
are troubling you and of the schemes of your
enemies, that you may meet with better success?
A test reading is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test
Is of little value; when the mind Is troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.

The English Channel TunneL
Once more is the notion of a railway
tunnel between England and France
discussed. This is ona of the
results of the "entente cordiale"â
which, by the way, is the title of a
new periodical published In both lan
guages and In the two countries for
the purpose of furthering the good feel,
ing that exists.
It is in the first number of this pub
lication that the tunnel scheme to unita
England and France is once more re
vived. The French Chamber of Com
merce is taking the matter up in Paris
and London.
The objections to the scheme have
come mainly from London. In Francs
there appears to be a very strong
body of opinion in favor of a rail,
way under the sea between Calais and
Dover, r Most people have probably for
! gotten that the tunnel was actual!?
j commenced In both countries somÂ«
years ago. About a mile on each sida
was constructed. â New York Com

Pretty young women of Elgin have
resorted to a practice that has casued
the Mayor of the town to go about hold
ing up his hands in dismay and pre
dicting all kinds of dire calamities.
The girls have taken to shooting
irons, and the hardware men have told
the Mayor that they have' cleaned out
their stores of everything from a toy
derringer to a breechloading shotgun.
They are now practicing on different
objects, and the Mayor is afraid some
brother, husband or sweetheart will be
filled with lead. He says that no one In
the 5ity limits Is safe, and Is sure that
some "down in Clintonville or up at
Dundee will be killed. : ,
It all came from the act of an Elgin
girl who drew a bead on a tramp who
tried to push past her Into the house.
The "Weary Willie put up the best
sprint that was ever heard of In the
town, the papers gave up space to the
Incident, and now every woman in the
town is determined to emulate her grit.

ROME, June IS. â The consistory,
which it was announced would be held
June 27, seems now to have been post
poned In order to avoid what would
have been almost a necessity, namely
that the Pope'should deliver an allocu
tion on the Franco-Vatican relations
while negotiations are being carried on
to clear up the incident of President
Loubet's visit to Rome. Besides im
portant changes in the French Govern
ment are expected, which by themselves
may solve the whole affair.
No date is given for the holding of
the consistory,

The tin fields in the United States
that have been periodically announced
for so many years have tended to make
men skeptical as to the probability of
the existence of this valuable metal in
this country in large quantities. How
ever, contrary to past reports In this
connection, the value of the tlnbearing
dike, recently discovered in Alaska
seems to increase with time. It has
been reported that ore to the amount
of fifteen tons from the Alaska Tin
Mining Company was, brought to Se
attle, Wash., recently. This ore was
taken out by sluice boxes, and re
sembles ordinary gray sand (stream
tin), and samples taken from the cargo
assayed 58 per cent tin at a Government
assay office. This ore had all been
worked by hand, but having demon
strated that the ore was In sufficient
quantity and rich 'enough to pay to
work it, the company plans to put In a
pumping plant and machinery that will
handle 500 tons of dirt a day. The
season, however, Is limited to 100 work
ing days.
A later report in regard to this Alaska
ore has Its source In an assay office In
Providence, R. I., which announces
that it is a very high-grade or almost
pure casslterite, and needs no concen
tration whatever; further, that twenty
claims have been taken up by different
parties, two of whom have sent to their
office ore which averaged nearly 50 per
cent tin. In view of the fact that
hitherto no tin has been profitably
mined in the United States, and that
for the years 1890 and 1902 tin imported
was worth about 27 cents a pound at
New York City on a consumption of
over 85,000,000 pounds, the importance
of this discovery is apparent. â Mines

The entire quantity of hay and oats
required for the U3e'of the army in the
Philippinesâ 5000 tons of hay and 6000
tons of oatsâ has been awarded to local
firms, who submitted the lowest bids in
competition with the dealers in Oregon
and Washington. Bids for furnishins
forage for army use were opened In
this city June 4 by Major Devol, tha
depot quartermaster.
Last fall a controversy arose between
the California and northern bidders ia
Oregon and Washington in regard to
the quality of the hay and oats from
the respective States and this dlsputa
was carried to Washington before the
quartermaster general of the army.
There seemed to be some hesitancy on
the part of army officials to purchase
California hay, as they were not fa
miliar with its good qualities until
Senators Perkins and Bard placed be
fore the quartermaster general Indis
putable evidence that the California
hay is so well thought of by the owners
of race horses that a number of them,
to-day are having California hay ship
ped to them across the continent.
The evidence as to the excellence of
California fodder placed before tin
quartermaster general was so strong
that the award was quickly made. The
transports Sherman and Dlx will load
at this port with hay and oats for Ma
nila during the coming month.

of Canada and who was dismissed by
the Government for, as they term it.
Indiscretion and insubordination,
shown In a recent speech at Montreal,
to-day in a statement given to the
press hits back at his critics.
Lord' Dundonald asserts that the
militia has been grossly interfered with
by party politicians. He alleges that
Important parts of his reports for 1902
and 1903 were wrongfully suppressed
by the MInlster f of Militia, contrary to
his wishes. He, indeed, charges Sir
Frederick Borden with falsehood in the
House of Commons. He shows that the
militia has been greatly neglectedâ it
lacks all that Is necessary to make It
efficient.
The great Northwest, he points out,
is left defenseless, without even a gun.
As regards preparation for war and
readiness to resist aggression, the peo
ple of Canada,, he says, are living In
a fool's paradise.

WASHINGTON, June 18.â A cable
gram received at* the State Department
from Consul General Gummere at Tan
gier, in confirming the press report that
the Sultan of Morocco had agreed to
all of Ralssouli'a terms, adds that
the money ransom, $55,000, was to have
been paid over to-day. Raissouli's ne
gotiator returned to Tangier last night
and reported that the terms had been
accepted, and said the money, as well
as the prisoners released by the Sul
tan to-day, must be immediately turned
over to Raissoull at Taradant and the
captives would be released. Gummere
and the British Minister objected to
this plan and sent a special courier to
Raissouli suggesting that the exchange
be effected through the Sheriff of
Wazan. The answer is expected to
morrow.

has not been In America for twenty
years, has been captured by tribesmen
â¢who are in revolt, and they demand
the release of all tribesmen held pris
oners by the Sultan, the discharge of
certain Governors of cities and $7000
ransom for this reprobate American,
who. by the way, has lived here and
become quite wealthy. I don't know
what the outcome will be, but we are
going to land 600 men to-morrow and
make a demonstration."

WHEAT â Liverpool futures were hlKher and
Liverpool! reported a better spot demand on
unexpected small shipments, unfavorable crop
reports from Argentina and Russia and a great
storm in Spain, which was reported to be do
ing much damage to crops.
Chicago was qulft and feitureletis and the
Ran Frdnclsco market was likewise dull and
uninteresting.
The Chicago letter of Mitchell. Mulcahy &
Co. said: "Liverpool was %d higher on small
world's shipments and the dry In
Southeastern Europe and . Argentina. This
caused some strength here and some covering
of shortB. It was neutralized, however, by
tho continued fine weather, fine crop reports
and very poor flour and cuieh demand. The
cash wheat situation still has .a declining ten
dency and the movement of the new crop is
Ketting nearer day by day. With good weather
In this country, the initiative of an advance
must, we think, come from abroad. European
Bupplles are very plentiful and it will take
Komething rather drastic In the way of a crop
outlook to sustain tin advance In the market
there. Some decrease In the visible supply is
expected, but It will not be likely to be more
than a year ago."

New York Grain and Produce.
The market for new Potatoes had a weak
tone, as the previous high prices checked the
consumptive demand somewhat, and, although
receipts were moderate, the market did not
clean up as well as on the preceding day.
General offerings of both red and white vari
eties sold at a lower range, while a few small
lots of exceptionally fine stock, which were
competed for by rival dealers, commanded the
usual premium. There was no change in
Onions, the demand being fair and supplies
well up to requirements.
As usual on Saturday, local trade in miscel
laneous vegetables was active and a good In
quiry was noted for shipment to Puget Sound
ports. TomatoeK were still in excessive sup
ply and were theNoo>ake*t article on the list,
with poor and soft lots selling below the mini
mum quotation. String and Wax Beans con
tinued to eell at a wide range as to quality,
and fancy Asparagus was firmer.

ally light was in some localities sharp enough
to cat down corn and tender vegetables on low
ground. Some fear is entertained that wheat
la bloom may have been injured.
The nights were too cool for the most rapid
growth of corn and garden vegetables, but the
000 1 weather was favorable io*" grain, espe
cially for winter wheat, which is generally
beaded out. and much of It in bloom. Barley,
â¢at*. Â«pring wheat and potatoes made good
progress. Early spring wheat is headed, or In
â¢the boot," End potatoes are in bloom. Clover
and alfalfa are ready to cut, and some haying
bae been dose. The latter crop is reported
somewhat light.
Hops have bÂ«en badly whipped by the wind,
and vermin are tr.crtaaing. which necessitates
â¢praying. Cut- worms are troublesome, and
caterpllltrs are etripping orchard trees in San
Juan County. The strawberry seascn Is r.-jw
pa*t its height; the crop ts hardly an average
one. Cherries arc rlf-ening and the crop is
short ia most localities.

The Chicago letter of Mitchell, Mulcahy ft
Co. says: "Receipts of hogs are less than a
year ago. The market, however, shows a he*l
tatlng action. Packers are trading on both
sides. The position Is. in our Judgment, a very
doubtful one. While the receipts of hogs have
been disappointing because large receipts had
been expected, yet any reason why there
should be any deficiency in the country is not
shown. We are inclined to think, after so
material an advance, we would take profits on
the bard spots."

direction.

The assortment of new Crcp Hay Is Increas
ing. A car of No. 1 Wheat, from McAvoy
station, Contra Conta County, came In yester
day, but received a bid of only $10 50 and was
not sold. New Wild Oat eoM. at $7 50Â®8 60.
and 2 cars of cultivated Oat sold at $9. Old
Hay remains as before quoted, and is dull.
The large draylng and other transportation
companies have lately turned a good many
horses out to pasture, owing to the falling off
In business, which of course cut* down the lo
cal demand for Hay somewhat. Besides, the
strike of the stablemen Is affecting the market.

Under the Influence of firm. cables the market
opened' strong, July being up Vi@-%o to %c. at
t>l%c to Si%(S*l%c. Another . factor that
helped to strengthen the situation was a sharp
falling In shipments from Australia. There
were also rumors of foreign orders here for
Immediate shipments at about a working basis.
After working up to 84&c the price- started
on a gradual decline, occasioned largely by sell-
Ing on fears of bearish statistics on Monday.
Weather conditions tended decidedly to weaken
values Just before the close there was re
newed'covering by shorts, and practically all
the loea was regained. The low point on July
was reached at 8394c. The close was at 84Â®
84 He. September closed at 79H079%o.
The initial strength of wheat extended a
supporting Influence on the corn market -at
the start, holding prices the first hour a trifle
above yesterday's closing figure. Jjut the mar
ket closed near the low point. July opened at
4S?lÂ»!{N8%e. closing at 47%c.
Selling of oats followed the weakness of
other grains, liquidation of July holdings
being a feature of trading. July closed at 38% c.
Provisions â Nothing doing; prices were
barely steady notwithstanding smaller re
ceipts of hogs and a firm market at the yard.
July pork closÂ»d at $12 85. Lard was un
changed at $13 97%. Ribs were up slightly at

E. A. Pierce, proprietor of the Ne
vada stables, yesterday brought suit in
the Superior Court for a perpetual In
junction restraining the Stablemen's
Union from interfering with him in the
conduct of his business. He alleges
that the union men have damaged him
ln the sum of 51000. but they are all
financially Irresponsible and unable to
respond to a judgment for damages.
Pierce alleges that on April 20, 1904,
certain representatives of the union
called upon him and demanded the dis
charge of a non-union stableman who
was ln his employ, and stated that If
be did not comply they would call the
union men out on a strike. He refuJsed
to discharge the man and the strike
was ordered on April 25, the union men
abandoning their work and threatening
to devise means to damage or destroy
his business.
UXION* MEN' AXXOY.
Pierce declares that since the Etrike
the union men have continued to an
noy him, and he has been threatened
that If he did not comply with their
demands he would be boycotted and
prevented from employing non-union
men. He is now employing non-union
men. end the union men have. It is al
leged, conspired among themselves and
â¢with outsiders unknown to Interfere
v1th the rigs boarded and cared for at
the stable and cause them to be dam
aged, bo as to make them unfit for
business, and by threats, intimidations
and assaults on employes who have or
may take the place of the strikers to
force them to quit.
He has made contracts with non
union men to work for a fixed term, and
the union, lt is declared, has combined
to Induce the men to break the con
tracts.
TICKETS IX THE WAY.
The union, he says, has placed agents
and pickets in front of his place of
business. They have called opprobrious
names and threatened with harm the
non-union employes, and "said union
xr.en in the vicinity of the place of busi
ness and elsewhere have waylaid and
assaulted the non-union employes, and
%vlll continue to waylay and assault
them."
The union, says Pierce, has sent
agents to his customers and demanded
that they remove their horses and vehi
cles from the Nevada stables under
threat of being boycotted. Some of the
customers named are Blake, Moffitt &
Towne; Owens, Varney & Co. and oth
ers. He says that the union pickets ln
loud and threatening voice have threat
ened violence and boycot to the pa
trons and customers of the stable. It is
alleged that the union men used the
following language to the employes: j
"If you work for this scab we will \
waylay you and beat your head off. If
we ever catch you outside of this stable i
ve will fix you. You are a band of*
convicts, and we will get every one of ,
you." |

defendants named in the suit are Sta
