up, boys, and have a drink. "When you
tet tired you can take your hands

not afraid of me. I don't want to kill
U"lth such cool expressions on the
part of a masked highwayman the sa
loon belonging to Jake Goodfriend and
William Briggs and located on the main
Eireet of the town was robbed of al
most $1000 shortly after midnight.
E'ght men were in the saloon, drink
ing and playing roulette, at 1 o'clock
â¢ this morning, when a short man with a
rtd handkerchief over his face entered,
and, stepping up behind a man at the
bar, leveled a revoHer over his shoul
etr at the bartender and commanded
all in the room to throw up their hands.
All thought it was a joke, but the
firi-t robber was quickly followed by
another and still shorter man, who re
peated the command of the first. The
eight men were lined up against the
back pt the barroom and tJie^tw-o hteh-'
v ay men walked to the roulette wheel,
- -R-here they laid their revolvers upon
the table. Then the taller, busily spun
the ball whJle the other swept the
money jnto a grip. Then they . forced
tthe wheel dealer to unlock-aNirawer of
Sold. They also emptied the two cash
. registers, getting altogether $945.
Just at this time a man entered the
Ealoon and the shorter robber, who was
es nervous as the other was cool,
backed into the street and then dis
appeared. Even then the other was
rot dismayed. He laughed, and. throw
ing $2 50 on the bar, ordered all up to
take a drink. The thoroughly cowed
men obeyed. The robber sat at the end
*f the bar, while one of the men handed
IMm a whisky bottle and another
\ landed him a glass. He then drank
with the rest of the men.
At this point two more men entered
from the outside. . He invited there men
to drink and with a laugh disappeared
through a side door, fully five minutes
sTtcr thp first robber had left.

OMAHA, Sept 28.â The peculiar ap

badly led to, the arrest: to-day of Miss
Anna Fisher,. who has turned out to be a
confirmed kleptomaniac, for whom, the po
lice have been hunting for weeks.
Last week | two glass eyes were stolen
from a local optical company, and a spe
cial effort was made by the police to cap
ture the thief. Sergeant Whalen saw the
woman seated in the writing-room at the
Murray Hotel and his attention was at
tracted by her, ill-fitting eye. When
searched at the police station another
eye was found In her possession.
A representative of the optical com
pany called at the station later and
nought to recover- the eyes, but the
woman absolutely refused to surrender
the eye she was wearing. The officials
were at a loss to know what to do. They
could not tear the eye from the woman's
head, for that would be assault, and for
the present, at any rate. Miss Fisher re
mains In possession of the stolen optic
The eye Is valued at S2O.

the names of dummies, hoped to gobble
up some of the best tracts in the State.
Of this aggregate amount or land 7000
acres ( are.in. in the limits of the proposed

lands Inside the reserve to use them for
the- selection of other lands. Their great
est, value to the purchasers was there

of the certificates were ready to back
out cf a bad deal.
Whn the real purchasers were cannot be

The reading of the report ot the com
mHtee en fr.sion followed. J. R. Pringle,
chairman of this committee, presented
the report, which was adopted. During
the tending of it the Schmitz claquers
ii :he gallery made a slisht demonstra
tion, interrupting Pringle, but soon sub
sided.
Tlie report of the committee on plat
form r.nd rsso'.utions followed. William
M. Cacocb, chairman of this committee,
rcail the platform. When the question
was put on the motion of Chairman Can
non for. the adoption of the platform Al
bert M. Johnson offered .an amendment
providing for the acquisition of a water
svpply and the Geary street road by the
city. Cannon moved that - the report of
the committee, together with the pro
posed amendment, be re-referred to the
committee. Mr. Johnson had no objec
tion and the motion carried, the cun
mfue~ again soing into conference.
Then tame the first flash of contest
that -marked the progress of the conven
tion. Aware of the fact that District At
torney Byington had been turned down
in caucus. John J. Greeley. assistant dis
trict attorney, moved -that every candi
date be given the right to be heard on
the floor. The danger that lurked in the
motion was immediately perceived and
it wes promptly voted down.
Chali-man Hickey then caljcd for nofni

A. Kelly of the Thirty-fifth District took
the platform and in a forceful speech
placed Henry V. Brandenstein in nomina

At the conclusion of Kelly's speech the
convention waited for a minute for some
word frcm Byington. but.it did not come.
A motion that nominations close was put
and cs-iritd. The secretary cast the bal
lot and lirandensteln was declared nom
inated. In answer to calls for Branden-'
stein. Chairman Hickey appointed Dele
gates Kelly and Pringle to escort the
nominee to the platform. Brandensteln's
speech rang with the spirit that resulted
In fusion. The blows aimed at the cor
rupt administration struck home In the
gallery and a howl of angrer went up
from the Schmitz but it was
instantly drowned by tbe cheÂ«rs from the
floor. In part Brandenstein said:
It is not my intention to take up' your time
%-ith a lung speech. I can only ray to you that
I will endeavor to do my duty. If I etood here
:rom non- until to-morrow morning I could only
give you the assurance of that. Do you be

Brandenstein was warmly applauded
< t
l by the delegates, but a few rowdies
\ in. the gallery sought to hoot him
down. Then the convention broke into
wild cheering for the nominee for Dis
trict Attorney and he emerged from
'the ordeal with, his campaign splendid
ly Inaugurated. '
Nominations fox Sheriff were called
for as soon as Brandenstein left the
platform and Oscar Sutro named' Peter
J. Curtt*, the. incumbent, for re-elec
tion. In part Mr. Sutro said: . ;

i GODCHAUX IS NAMED. .
; The nominations for Recorder were
j next called for. Louis H. Mooser took
' the platform to name the incumbent,
I iiidmund Godchaux. He dwelt upon the
J etticiency and faithfulness of the pres
j ent Recorder and the convention ap
! plaudtd him. Tlie nomination was sec
i onded, it was moved that the riomina
l lions close and the vote of the conven
i tion was cast by the secretary for God-
I chaux.
Louis Ferrari of the Thirty-third
' nominated Dr. Thomas B. W. Leland
: for the oiiice of Coroner. Ferrari nor
n! mated Ueland for Coroner two years
I iigo and in his speech last night gave
ja. brief account of 'the efficient work
jof the present Coroner. The nomina
| lions were closed and the ballot cast
for Leland.
J. W. Bryan nominated M. J.. Hynes
for the office of Public Administrator.
The record of Hynes stands without
blot and Bryan dwelt upon his flne
work; as Public Administrator. He pre
dicted'that Would : be. elected by
iÂ«t almost undivided vote. The vote of
the convention was cast for Hynes by
the secretary.
The regular order of business was
suspended to again take up tbe report
of the committee on platf orm. ' . The
proposed amendment to. the platform,
offered by Delegate Johnson, was re
ported upon unfavorably. . Johnson
(igain. moved, his .amendment and was
given the floor to speak upon its mer
its, precipitating a most interesting
row in which the lie freely passed.
Johnson opened the debate, by tak
j ing the, rostrum and again reading his
proposed amendment to the platform,
which' is as follows: , .
\u0084 We (avor toe acquisition of â¢ a municipally
owned water supply for San Francisco - from
the waters that now run to waste in the high
Sierras above the area of human habitation
and we pledge our nominees to carry out the
Idaaa proposed by former City Engineer Grun
! sky, which provide for the use of the waters C(
â¢ the Tuolumne watershed; and as it is neces
sary to obtain the consent of the United rfiaie.i
Government to locate reservoirs in the Hetch-
Hetchy . Valley and at Lake Eleanor in order
to make use of the Tuolumce waters, . we
lurthtr pledge our nominees to use every ef
fort to induce the President and the Interior
Department -to act favorably upon the city's 1
application and -we further pledge them to
I make such appropriation in the budget as will
! enable the city's claim to the use of these
J waters to be presented to every organization
] and municipality in the nation, that their sup
port in its behalf may be enlisted.
We pledge our nominees to carry into effect
the plans proposed by former City Engineer
\u25a0 Grunsky and Engineer J. C. H. Stut lor the
j construction and operation of the Geary street

JOHNSON STOPS GALLERY.
When lie concluded reading- the pro
posed amendment Johnson, who had
met with some interruption, turned on
the gallery, and, with that pugnacity
J for which he is noted, whipped it into
j siJence. He said it .was a Democratic
(convention and had met for the pur
j poses of Democrats. He dartd any
I man in the gallery to cheer for Jschmitz,
i and then waited for a reply. Jiut the
j grallery made no , reply. It sat cowed
j under Johnson's threat that he would
; call upon the delegates and the citizens
t to drive the first "indecent wretch" that
I dared to cheer for. any man not a
I Democrat out into the night. The ef
fect of Johnson's threat surprised even
Johnson and for the rest of the night
not the first indication of disorder was
In evidence. Returning to th*e question
of his proposed amendment, Johnson
turned the vials of his wrath upon
those that opposed him. He said:
Last Thursday the Citizens' League that is
furthering the scheme of municipal ownership
called upon . John S. Partridge, the nominee
of the Republican convention for Mayor and
the roan that will be the nominee of this con
vention, and laid before him the principles
contained in this amendment I offer. Thu
I league wag assured by â¢ Mr. Partridge that
i these principles had his sanction and that he
J would u*e hie efforts to see that they .w<Â»re

Perry Newberry against Paul McCarthy^ a depnty registrar, and two falsely registered men, Harry' D. Gilbert

election laws were committed by these men. League watchers witnessed^ the crimes andswp^

j Registration yesterday and last night
was the heaviest In the- history of the
city during any like periqd. During the
da/ and evening 3500 were registered. At
the present rate It la expected that fully
95,000 will be entitled to vote on election
day. Last night the registration room
was packed. . People pushed and shoyed
in the heated and foul atmosphere of the
'registration room for a place in the score
or more of lines that ran to the desks.
As usual, the known Schmitz recruits re<
ceived due consideration: Crooked meth
ods were in vogue among Ruef politi
cians, from the Election Commissioners
and State Senators down to the Registrar
and his hired assistants. â¢
More warrants may be sworn to to-day.
It is known that, two more men besides
McCarthy, Walsh .and Gilbert were regis
tered falsely. Joseph P. Descalze, an
Italian living at 460 â¢ Union street, was
\u25a0registered \u25a0. without- naturalization, papers
[or affidavit yesterday afternoon. The
clerk who registered him knew that the
man was not naturalized, yet this fact
did not daunt the hireling of Ruef. Gus
tave Johnson, a Swede living at 1523 l ,a
Market street, was also registered yes
terday afternoon without his naturaliza
tion papers being demanded. Johnson
told the clerk who entered his name on
the roll that he was not a naturalized
citizen. Both of the foregoing illegalacls
were witnessed by\ Perry H. Newberry
and other league. men, who were on. the
lookout for criminal acts in connection
wiht the -registration at the City Hall.
Johnson was brought into the Registrar's
office' by Senator Nelson, 'who' demanded
that he be registered. \ ; ' . -
Five warrants for Walsh, McCarthy,
Gilbert, Johnson and Descalze were to
have been sworn to, but the league de
tectives believed that the â¢ arrest of the
three former w would suffice to bring to
a sudden stop the nefarious work, of -the
Pvuef gang. The* f league is determined to
make an example of the three violators
of election laws and J will: prosecute their
cases actively, .: As soon as ,it became
known that warrants \u25a0were out for the
three the effect on the gangsters ' was
magical. The telegram system worked
by the deputy registrars, for the alleged
cancellation of prior registrations in oth
er counties was abandoned. The good
work of' the league officials had the do
sired effect. ',
Perry Newberry. who is watching the
registration end of the Ruef crookedness,
says that the gangsters have several
hundred illegal registrations on the
books. Four ex-convicts were registered
by the Schmitz men yesterday. Every il
legal registration will be challenged by
the league men, and before the date for
the election the Registrar's roll will be
ble of fulfillment. I say. that there s no epe
cltic declaration in favor of municipal own

Is the belief that concerted action will tend
to bring about public ownership, and I con
tend that this Is not specific instruction In
(avor of the policy, that I advocate.
Johnson was cheered when he left
the platform, -but the audience became
silent when Cannon, anger showing on
his features, took the platform in de
fense of the position he had taken. He
said: \u25a0'â¢\u25a0?;}
The statement made by Mr. Johnnon that
this committee met and agreed to accept the
amendment he now proposes is not true. What
he says Hoarding an alleged statement by me
holding Oscar Sutro responsible for the dereat
of thie amendment -Is also false. There was
no one person renDonÃible for the rejection
of this amendment he proposes, but the en
tire committee was of one \u25a0 accord ; every one
had a heartnz and thU p.atform meets with
the views or" all. "What I said to Mr. Johnson
in regard to Mr. Sutro I .said in private. I
aid not mention It with the -, idea that he
would malce capital out of it. but â¢ I told It
to him confidentially, as a friend. I thought,
naming myself also as one against the amend
ment While Mr. Johnson says that the.plat
form does not contain a specific provision in
favor or public ownership. I Â«ay that It does.
We reachfd the conclusion that should we
adopt this amendment as' proposed we would
lrrsvccably bind the Board of; Supervisors .to
a plan for the acquisition of a water supply
that may be Impossible of .fulflllment ami
thereby defeat the . very purpose of < the plank
v. c have Incorporated in this platform pledg
ing every candidate that may be nominated In
this convention to carry out the .; principles
of the Democratic party In favor of. municipal
ownership of public utilities. I do not know
what may actuate-'Mr. Johnson In the- stand
he ha? taken here. Maybe his idea' is to pre
vent San Francisco getting a water - supply.
If such Is the case his scheme would probably
work very successfully.' if adopted by . this con
vention, ; for .if the nominees ..were absolutely
pledged to secure one water supply and the of
ficials should find that It was not . availablÂ«
they would ,be under inp \u25a0 oblisation to secure
any other that might be offereii.
SUTUO MAKES ' DENIAL.
Oscar' Sutro, also; thoroughly, indig
nant; followed Cannon to the stand. In
part,|he said: \u25a0;
. This \u25a0 is, a -late hour to inject personalities
into this "convention., but â¢ as - another , has

motive will not be questioned if I follow. In
his lines. Mr. Johnson; lied when he said that
any motive other; than a â¢ desire â¢to serve the
people actuated my. stand against his " pro

indeed for- me to sacrifice' the \u25a0 slightest; iota

Last night" the Schmitz partisans were
hard at work. A corps of guides, includ
ing several policemen, was busy rushing
to the ; front every man who wore a
Schmitz button. If a man was 'seen wear
ing the right button he could, register in
five*, minutes in Registrar Adams' private
Schmitz registration room. Ruef lieuten
ants ; came and went regularly 'with a
motley following of "hop heads'.' and for
eigners. All of these paid Schmitz voters
\u25a0were treated with great courtesy and al
lowed to enter the private place where
only Schmitz voters were [ registered;
Election Commissioner Voorsanger was
one of. the rustlers. He brought a, line
of followers into Registrar Adams' of
fice, where they were entered on the
Great Register as Schmitz voters. . Kid
Sullivan, the pickpocket, jail-bird and ex
cohvict.' brought in several of his San
Quentin acquaintances. ;
Paul McCarthy, who brazenly, defied the
law and falsely registered voters, worked
last night, carefully watched by the
league men, until at 10:30 o'clock he was
arrested by Deputy Sheriff Hynes and
taken to the Hall of Justice. His arrest
caused a tremor among the Ruef men.
Registrar Adams openly, gave vent to his
"hurt" feelings, and Election Commis
sioner Roberts' vituperation; was fit only
to be r heard in a barroom. Roberts, of
course, believed' the arrest of McCarthy
to be dirty politics and only spite' work.
He became enraged at the exposure of
the stuffing ;of the Great Register. New
berry saysvthat he warned McCarthy re
peatedly .iigainst" pommittirtg the offense
for 'which ' he., was '"arrested, and did hot

Driven to desperation, the JTuef dis

slogan. Maestretti is said to be. active,
in "rounding them. up" arid Stete Sena-;
tor Nelson, 'who claims to' own the Latin
quarter,-. is. more than active these days.
LEAGUE WATCHERS KEEK.
"Shrewd as thesÂ«: ward heelers are. the
league watchers are more than a match
for them. The "fact "that the league
was watching the registration was not
advertised. The work was done quietly
and thoroughly. Now the league, has
in its possession list's of the gangsters
who have been fraudulently entered
upon the register. : Warrants will be
issued and not one' will escape. And
the', men -.who rounded them up will not
escape.-- ."".'â¢'. <
The "round up" is drawing all sorts
of characters to the registration office.
The place Is carefully guarded against
"trouble" by policemen, who are mere
ly representatives: of "the gang."
Gilbert-was arrested yesterday after
noon. He had one of those ..''l ain't took
no chicken"* expressions on when
nabbed. .Then he-tried, to pass it off as
a "joke,* But when the iron idoor of the
cell clanged \upon^him*'Gllbert 'realized
that "the league meant business.- Others
will reallze.lt, too, in a few. days.
The ."rounders-up" of riffraff took alarm
.yesterday afternoon. The word was
passed, "The 'league is on." When the
full extent of the watchers' work is re
vealed some of the big gangsters w m
spend uneasy nights. They have been
obeying orders from their boss, regard
less of the law. They did not know
that the league - was watching. For
once shrewd honesty was able to cope
with experienced trickery.
Perry Newberry, the league attor
ney, swore to the three warrants be- j
fore Judge Fritz. Many a gangster is
wondering where the ax will fall next.. |
WORKING THE GAME.
McCarthy had been placed in ; charge
of the ; information bureau, . which im
mediately adjoins the room where
voters are actually registered by \ the
depu ty -registrars. .. . McCarthy was sup
posed to give intending voters such
information as would enable them to
have their snames entered on the Great
Register.: When Gilbert presented him
self he told -McCarthy "that he was al
ready registered' in Sacramento . ' and
gave his occupation as a barber. Mc-
Carthy said he /would 1 ; telegraph to
Sacramento to have the registration in
that county canceled, and handed Gil
bert a card on which was written
"Register . this\man, O. K." , Gilbert
presented this card to a deputy regis
trar "und - was duly registered despite
the protests of -Newberrji, who claimed
that the law 'was being violated. < <
Newberry says that McCarthy pur
sued the same tactics when Walsh pro-
ordered, the convention to again meet at

Ir-We believe that good citizenship, united, will
sented himself for registration. Walsh
said he resided at the corner of Twen
ty-fourth 'and ; Folsom streets, but had
been registered^in San Mateo County.
McCarthy said tit: would be all right,
as he; would, telegraph to San Mateo
to- have Walsh's * registration canceled
there. > Walsh was also registered on
the "O. k.". of McCarthy.
When thY warrants" were put In the
hands -of the- deputy sheriffs they had
no difficulty" in locating Gilbert, who
was found" employed as a hostler at
the- stable of Madigan . & O'Neill. 122
Grove, street. Gilbert was taken to the
Sheriff's office, where he made the fol
lowing statement to Under Sheriff Wil
liam -Hypes.
"When rl made up my .mind to get
registered I went to. see George Keane,
the Mayor's secretary. Keane sent me
down ' to. 'the*- information - bureau. \u25a0, I
told them I' was. registered am Sacra
mento and they told me it would be
all .right. I : gave :some . one. 25 cents
to send a telegram to Sacramento to
cancel my registration there. and. to get
my transfer papers. Then I .was regis
tered in this city."
SEARCHING FOR MCCARTHY.
Gilbert was taken to the city prison,
where a charge of violating the elec
tion- laws \u25a0\u25a0 was placed against him.
The deputy sheriffs next directed
their attention to locating Walsh, who
had given his residence as Twenty
fourth and Folsom streets. The depu
ties were unable to find Walsh at, the
address and no one in the neighbor
hood knew Of a person by that name.
The fact that Walsh does not live at
the address given by him while^hÂ© was
being sworn to be registered is deemed
proof conclusive that he is a stuff er.
The Sheriff's deputies \u25a0 experienced
difficulty in finding Deputy Registrar
McCarthy. As soon as Registrar Adams
got wind of the fact that a warrant
had been sworn out for McCarthy's ar
rest he told the latter to leave his
desk, and ; for several hours Mc-
Carthy could not be found. Adams
said he had sent McCarthy out to tako
care of some voting machines which
are. on exhibition for educational pur
poses McCarthy -is a civil service
clerk, appointed for a temporary period
during the rush of registration.
McCarthy was taken into custody last
night at .the Registration office where he
was serving as deputy, registrar. Deputy
Sheriff Hynes- took -him to ;the City
Prison, where he was booked for the vio
lation of 'election â¢'laws.- He was immedl^
ately released on JlOOO cash bail." given by
his father, fJ^VV.; McCarthy,- secretary, "of
the Fire Commission. \u25a0 â¢â¢ ..*. : ',Â»., , iÂ»Â« .â¢?
Young McCarthy, was rushed- Irpm the
Registrar's office yesterday afternoon as
soon as it became known among .the'
gang that there was a warrant for hia
arrest. Last night he returned and was
In the midst of his work wnen arrested.
He refused to say anything.
THAT SECRET ROOM.
Registrar Adams denies that he
opened a secret . room for the purpose
of registering members of the Schmltz-
Ruef gang. Adams states that on Mon
day evening when hundreds of voiiera
were, in line waiting to be registered
he opened "Room 9," which is opposite
the main registration room, and put
several deputies at work 'to relieve tfie
situation. Adams says some of the vo
ters had been waiting for an hour or
two and It was with a view to the ac
commodation of citizens that he opened
another 'room. Adams admits that most
of those registered ,in the relief room
were either friends of his or men
prominent in official or professional
life. Adams says It would be impos
sible to handle' the immense registra
tion on the last days unless additional
deputies ; were put to work and this
necessitates the, pressing Into 'service
of another room for the purpose. .
Adams professed to know nothing re
garding the charges made by Perry
Newberry agaiast Deputy Registrar
McCarthy of. violating the election
laws. . Adams did not even know
whether _ Walsh \u0084 or Gilbert had :been
registered, saying, it would-be impos
sible to unearth their affidavits from
the great number filed for the day.

Pirm of E..T. Frasier, Where
Dead 3lan Was Employed
as Cashier, Can Giye Xo
Eeason for Clerk's. Suicide
Joe B. Wells, cashier for the K. T. Fra
sler Draying Company, at 105 Second
street, committed suicide yesterday In
Oakland by shooting himvl* through the
head. The cause of the. rash act is un
known. E. T. Frasler. the manager of
the draying company, says that Wells
had been in his employ for about one
year, and that he was about 23 years old.
While employed by him he gave the ut
most satisfaction. He made the collec
tions and paid the bills. In fact. Wells
had full charge of the cash financing of
the firm, and 'at the same time had
charge of the books. Last week Frasler
found it necessary to get a bookkeeper to
assist Wells. As soon as the new book
keeper came Into the office Frasier no
ticed a change in the manner of Wells..
On Monday at 11 o'clock Wells took hl3
.collection books and went out to collecÂ«i
money, due from the customers of f^af
firm. That 'was thn last seen of hin^
The books were returned througb the
mail to the firm yesterday morning. Fra
sier at once began a search for ; the miss
ing man. He visited Wells' rooms at 5U
Taylor street and found that Wells had
left there with all his effects.
Frasler said he was not In a position to
say whether there was any shortage In
Wells' accounts. He was having the
books of the firm experted. and by to
day would know If there was any defal
. cation. 7. #
â¢ Wells was engaged to be married to
: Miss Ruth Roberts, who lives at 509 Leav
enworth street. She was completely pros
. trated. by\.the news of . her" fiance's sui
;dde.,,She could not understand what mo
! tive could have prompted him to take hla
life. She said:
t . "JVe.were engaged to be mar;*Â»d. and I
was. h preparing^, w . . w*d Jinsr \ outflÂ«c â ' He
came to." sÂ°ee me Sunday night, and w*aÂ«
as lively and Jolly as ever. This morn-
Ing' f received a note from him. In whicli
he said that he thought It best to say
good-J&y to me. and that I would never
see him again. I could not understand
what he meant by writing such a letter.
He was well connected and finely educat
ed. His family live In South Carolina.
He always carried a pistol, and was very
fond of showing it. He took It out of hia
pocket on Sunday night and flourished It
around. It is a terrible blow to me."
The manager of the Oriental Hquse In
Oakland sayg that Wells came to his ho
tel on Monday and rented a room. Ho
had a dress-suit case with him. He failed
to appear there yesterday, so the land-,
lady broke into the room and found Well.^B
lying dead on the bed. A revolver waaj
lying by his side. No word of explana
tion was left- In his pockets was
found $110 and a cheap watch. The body
was removed ' to the/Morgue.
Late last night Miss Roberts, accom
panied by her mother. Mrs. K. Roberts,
went over to Oakland to view the re-,
mains, and arrange for the' funeral. 1
When Miss Roberts entered the room
where her Intended lay dead she fainted, 1
and it was some time before she was
sufficiently recovered to look upon thÂ©
dead face of her intended husband. \u0084...*

War Cloud in
England.
LONDON*. Sept. 26.â The text of the
new agreement between Great Britain
and Japan, which was signed by Lord
Lansdowne, the British Foreign Secre
tary, and Baron Hayashi, the Japanese
Embassador to Great Britain, on August
12. was issued by the Foreign Office
last evening- The momentous docu
ment is a brief one, comprising less
than 600 words, including eight articles
-.d a preamble.
r The main features of the new agree
ment have already been forecasted in
the dispatches from London and Paris.
The articles of the official text, how
ever, bring out forcefully the tremend
ous importance to both countries of
this alliance, which practically makes
Great Britain Japan and Japan Great
Britain for the purpose of defense "in the
regions of East Asia and India." This
inclusion of India specifically as a
point at which any aggression by a
foreign power will call for the assist
ance of Japan finds much favor with
the press of London, the morning pa
pers in long articles welcoming the new
and more extensive alliance of the two
insular kingdoms west and east as
giving immediate relief from the dan
gerous thunder cloud which for so
many years has hung over the Indian
frontier.
EFFECTIVE SAFEGUAKI).
Baron Hayashi. who was interviewed
after the publication of the agreement,
eaid: â¢; '.
"The new treaty forms an effective
safeguard against the renewal of dis
turbances in the Far East- That is its
object. We cannot say that a perma
nent peace has been secured â that is
too much to be sure of â but we can
aver that tranquillity has been assured
for a long time to come. This applies
not only to Great Bri'ain and Japan,
but also to all powers having political
or commercial interests in that part
fit the world, in fact to all who have
Â£'-en interested in maintaining the
Â«t*:us quo."
S:r Charles Dilke took the position
that the new treaty makes no changes
in the pre-existing status quo, but said
it v.as an inevitable consequence of the !
new conditions in the Far East and it
was only a stronger guarantee for the
maintenance of peace than the pre
vious alliance. He argued that Rus
sia never really was a menace to the
Indian frontier, but merely played on
the susceptibilities of Great Britain.
With regard to Persia, Sir Charles did
not believe that Russia would ever risk
a c.uarrel with India. "In reality." said
he. "the countries most affected are
France and Germany, because to both
the new treaty secures possessions
which they might have found it im
possible to defend."
"While thÂ«re is some criticism of the
tr*Â»ty in the radical newspapers,- It is
only half-hearted, and as a whole Lon
don, which has been anxiously await
ing the breaking of official silence with
regard to the document, heaves a sigh
of relief and greets with great satisfac
tion the positive assurance of the fu
ture assistance of a powerful Oriental
ally in all matters pertaining to Far
Eastern politics.
PREAMBLE IS SHORT.

LAXSDOW.VE AXD HAYASHI.
The 'treaty Is signed by Foreign Secre
tary Lansdowne on behalf of Great Brit
ain, and Baron Hayashi, the Japanese
', Minister, on. behalf of Japan.
With the treaty was Issued a dlsnjatch to
-the British Embassador at Sfer Peters
burg. Sir Charles Hardinge. with *the re
quest, that the treaty be communicated
to the Russian Government." This dls
jt*^ph Is explanatory of the delay in pub
ir^iing the treaty due to the progress of
'negotiations looking to peace between
Russia and Japan. In it Lord Lansdowne

tional instrument to which no exception can
be taken by any of the powers interested In
affairs of the Far East.
Great Britain. I believe, may count on f the
good will and support of all the powers In en
deavoring: to maintain peace in Eastern Asia
and lr seeking to unhold the integrity and In
dependence of the Chinese empire and the
principle of equal opportunities for 'the com
merce and Industry of all nations In that em
pire. On the other hand, the Interests of the
contracting: parties are of a kind upon which
they are fully entitled to Insist, and the an
nouncement that those interests must be safe
ruarded Is one which ran create no surprise
and r.ted give rise to no misgivings.
Special mention Is made of articles 2
and 3. Of the latter Lord Lansdowne
says:
SPEAKS OF RUSSIA.
It recognises in the clearest terms the para
mount position which Japan at this moment
occupies and must henceforth occupy In Ko
rea, and her right to take the measures which
ehe may find necessary for the preservation
oÂ£ her political, military and economic Inter
ests In that country. It Is. however, expressly
provided that such measures must not be con
trary to the principles of equal opportunities
for the commerce and Industry of other na
tions. The treaty at this point differs con
spicuously from that of 1002. It has, however,
become evident that Korea, owing to Its close
proximity to the Japanese empire and its In
ability to stand alone, must fall under the
control and tutelage of Japan. His Majesty's
Government observes with satisfaction that
this point haa been readily conceded by Russia
in the treaty of peace, and there is every rea
son to believe that similar views are held by
the other powers with regard to the relations
which should exist between Japan and Korea.
His Majesty's Government ventures to an
ticipate that the alliance thus concluded,
designed, as It Is, for objects that are purely
peaceful and for the preservation of rights
and Interests the validity . of which cannot b?
contested, will be regarded with approval T>y
the Government to which they are accredited.
The British Government Is Justified in bellev-.
Ing; that the conclusion of this alliance may
not have been without effect in facilitating the
settlement by which war was so happily
brought to an end. and Its members earnestly
trust that the alliance may for years to come
be Instrumental In securing the peace of the
world In those regions which come within its
scope.
A similar dispatch was addressed to Sir
Francis Bertie, the British Embassador
at Paris. . !

ANOTHER SIDE
TO THE STORK
Surgeon Stokes of the Navy
Challenges Statements of
Low Japanese Mortality
DETROIT, Sept. 26.â An attack this
afternoon by Dr. Charles F. Stokes,
surgeon in the United States Navy,
upon statements made by Major Louis
L. Seaman of New York in utterances
contrasting the results obtained dur
ing the Russo-Japanese war "by the
Japanese medical officers with the med
ical history of the Spanish-American
war and Philippine Insurrection, was
the feature of the opening day of the
fourteenth convention of Jhe Associa
tion of Military Surgeons of the United
States.
Dr. Stokes sharply challenged the
accuracy of a number of Major Sea
man's statements and statistics. Dr.
Stokes quoted. Dr. Seaman as stating
that for a campaign lasting six weeks
during the Spanish war the propor
tional battle casualties to those of dis
ease were 6ne to fourteen. Then he
quoted the report of the Secretary of
War for 1899 as showing that this pro
portion was one to one-half. Dr. Sea
man makes the proportion of ; battle
casualties In the Civil War one to flve,
continued Dr. Stokes, "while the pro
portion as shown by the medical and
surgical history of the rebellion was
one to two." . .
The speaker then quoted an alleged
statement by Dr.- Seaman that* in Gen
eral Oku's army only 40 out of 5609
men sent home had died, and said:
He must have been in error in this. Forty
cases of eudden death at the front occurred
but all the serious cases were transferred to the
baee hospitals in the rear, of these 5609 cases
there were 6070 cases of berl-beri,' a disease
with a mortality rate almost as high as ty
phoid fever. In the second Japanese army of
Ci.ooo men there was a sick list of 24,642 in
eeven months, which gives an annual mortality
rate of 740 per thousand, which is not very dif
ferent from that of other armies under favor
able conditions.
Dr. Stokes then quoted Dr. Seaman
as saying before the military affairs
committee of the House of Represen
tatives that beri-beri Is almost un
known in the Japanese army. â¢'/;\u25a0*\u25a0 -
"On the contrary,": said he,- "it is
known that the first army had in four
months 4640 cases of beri-beri and the
second army 6070 in seven months, and
it. Is said that the losses to Nogl's
army before" Port Arthur were 25,000,
from berl-berl alone."

Make No Attempt to Conceal
Their Identity and Say Pa
per^ on Which They Re
ceived Money Is Genuine
A. L. Rice and "W.O. Gilman, 'alleged
to be bank swindlers, but strongly as
serting their innocence, were arrested
at the Palace Hotel yesterday morning
on advices from the East, by Detective
Charles ,H. Reimer.; of the Plnkerton
Agency and Detective Ed Gibson of the
local force.' The men are now held in
the city prison* awaiting the result of
an investigation of their dealings with
the United. National Bank of Provi

Charles \u25a0 F. \u25a0 Corbett,- who was found in
their company. ., He is retained on
suspicion, and is not charged with com
plicity in | the aueged offense.
The alleged , crime for which these
men are held is the obtaining of money
by a loan On. worthless stocks. Gilman
is said to have introduced Rice to Pres
ident A. B.:Gale of the bank mentioned,
and Rice then produced the paper on
which the loan was made. 'â¢> The stock
purported to be of the Norfolk and
Western Railway Company and on it
$6500 was advanced. Then Rice and
Gilman left Providence. Gale alleges
that, the stock was found to be worth
less.. He notified the Pinkerton'agency
in Boston, and the capture of, the men
followed. . V
The arrests were ; easily made. The
men were registered, under their own
names and evidently made no attempt
to hide their, identity. Both received
mail at the hotel and both had drawn
drafts on Eastern concerns. Gilman
was caught<as ; he " stepped from the
elevator, and*Rlce was found smoking
in the lobby.;^. ; Both denied that : they
were criminals.\vThey were'well dressed
and seemed -to -have plenty of money.
The two ; men' have a far different
story to , tell" from that of President
Gale. Both express indignation over
their Incarceration, and both swear that
they will make the president of the
Providence Bank pay dearly for the af
fair. "I am a broker In Providence,"
said Gilman, Vand* President Gale, is my
friend. I was Interested" In a mining
deal In British Columbia and wanted
Rice to, go. in^with .me. Rice did not
have the mon'eyready, but told me that
he had .some good stock. On this.: I
Introduced him to President Gale and
he advanced- Rice the money. ' There
was no fraud. -Rice" merely showed the
stock and was asked , how .much he
wanted on It. He said $6500, and got
it without question. .
"Then we started for the mine. "We
arranged everything there and came by
easy stages to San Francisco. Here we
sent -our. tickets East, so we could be
routed over another .line, , and we were
waiting for their return when we were

. "We left Providence openly and were
in no sense fugitives. Our friends came

J. V. Allen of St. Louis, who is a guest!

his arrival, about, one week ago. 'Allen

AJten was enjoying the sights on Mar

night when he met a party of genial fel

and evidently looked the part of- the un

the way he watched tall buildings or
dodged street cars that first attracted the
attention of the easy-money- men, but at
any rate no time was lost In gathering
him into the net. ". After several sociable
drinks Allen found himself . accepting an
automobile ride to the beach with a gen

game of cards accomplished the balance
of the work and Allen dropped $75 with

quartz did exist, where the Indian tra

AIRSHIP USED
TO CARRY MAIL
Aeronaut Sails Over Port
land and Delivers Letters
on Eoofs of Buildings
PORTLAND, Sept. of the most
remarkable flights ever accomplished In
an airship was made to-day by Lincoln
Beachey in the airship City of Portland
from the Lewis and Clark Exposition
grounds over the city and back to the
exposition grounds. Not only was the
flight a success from a spectacular stand
point, but In a measure it demonstrated
the possibilities of airships hi commercial
affairs. Beachey navigated the huge ves
sel with wonderful dexterity and prtci
slon, at all times having the airship un
der control.
During his flight Beachey made one
stop, on top of the Chamber of Com
merce building, where he delivered a let
ter written by President Goode of the
exposition to the Chamber of Commerce
relating to the efforts of the Chamber
of Commerce and the commercial clubs
of the city in their desires to secure an
attendance of .100,000 at the exposition on
next Saturdayâ Portland day.
After delivering President Goode's let
ter tÂ» the Chamber of Commerce Beachey
once more ascended and headed his air
ship toward the office of the Oregon
Journal, where he dropped another letter
addressed to that paper by President
Goode. From the Journal the airship
swiftly made its way to the Oregonian
building, where another letter addressed
!to the Evening Telegram bearing on
Portland day was dropped on the roof of
the building. \u25a0 ~Â»r,
From the Oregonian building Beachey
headed westward toward St. Vincent
Hospital, maneuvering high In the air
over that building for some minutes. He
then headed the airship for the exposi
tion grounds, where he landed safely
after one of the most remarkable flights
in the history of air navigation.

MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY

Young Woman Is Brutally
Murdered on a British
Railroad Train.
LONDON. Sept. 26.-The Merstham tun
nel of the London and Southeastern Rail
way, where the brutal murder of Freder
ick f.- Gold by Percy Leroy. alias Maple
ton, occurred June 27. ISSI. again has
been the scene of a mysterious tragedy,
the details of which, so far aa ascer
tained, axe markedly similar to that of a
quarter of a century ago. In the presetit
case the victim is a young woman, Mary
Money, whose body was horribly muti
lated. A long veil, wks tightly wedged in
her mouth and the police are confident
that the woman was murdered in the
compartment of a train on which ehe was
traveling and that her body was thrown
from the car. The fict that none of the
doors of the car on Its arrival at Red
Hill was open is considered to prove
conclusively that It waa not a c&se of
suicide. Mies Money left her home Sun
day evening, -saying she would not be
rone long.
The affair thereafter Is a complete mys
tery-. No ticket was found on the body
and no one has been able to explain un
der what circumstances the young wom
an entered the train or where she was go
}ng. If she was murdered, &g is supposed
to be the case, the murderer disappeared
without leaving 'any trace. The. cars
furnish no clew to the crime, which could
have occurred nowhere but in a railroad
car divided into separate compartments
such as Is used on the British railways.

Tartars : : Butcher; Armenians
. With Fiendish Brutality
While Cossacks Look On
LONDON, \6ept. 26.â Interesting Inci
dents of the experiences of the ; English
men connected with the oil industry at
Baku are reaching their relatives In Eng
land. Williams, one of the four English
men rescued from a mOD'at Balakhan.
writes that the stories of the horrors
give but a feeble idea of the actual oc
currences. He adds: ;
I was shut up In my place at Zabratt for five
days without any. water, except naizan (local
mineral water). All the -people horewtre cry-
Insr end fainting. All avrjuml were fires and
rifle shots. Ten. Armenians were killed out of
those In our own yard.'. You could not walk.a
yard without several shots' being fired â¢at you.
We trled'to Save the wounded, but the shooting
was too general and we had to give. up the at
tempt. '.".- /.- - -â¢- - \. .
Edward McCallum, another . rescued
British subject," fully confirms the stories
of massacre, burning and pillage. After
describing the commencement of the out
break, \u25a0 September 2, when the Armenians
massacred 300 Tartars, he describes how,
during the night of September 6, Tartars
entered the workmen's barracks at Ro
niitni and massacred everybody in them
within an hour. Five hundred Tartars
surrounded the works where McCallum
was stationed and forced him to 'give up
the Armenians hiding on the premises.
He cays:
Fourteen of these'were butchered In our yard
with n>:idlsh brutality, unr man had his en
tire stomach cut put. The band- sacked the
neighborhood in the most systematic manner.
They had carts ready to take away their plun
der to the Tartar villases. Fifty g Cossacks,
with a police chief, arrived on the scene, but
did not do anything but look on at the work of
massacre. The whole time we were besieged
we lived on condensed ealt water.
SITUATION NOW
GROWS CRITICAL
LONDON, SeDt. 27.â The correspondent
of the Morning Post at Budapest says:
The situation here gro\V worsp daily.
The Radical "element threaten to swamp
the. Moderate party' and to . hurry | the
country into irreparable action. Public
references to the dynasty are made in a
tone which it Is impossible to reproduce.
The principal newspapers urge the forma
tion of one great party under Francis
Ivossuth." This is . supported by Kosauth,
Count Apponyi arid Baron. Banffy. j. -
Other special dispatches represent' the
situation as serious, but say it is evi
dent that the conservative elements hesi
tate to countenance the driving of mat
ters to a point where compromise would
be.lmpossibsle. â
The Dally Telegraph's Budapest corre
spondent says that extreme excitement
prevails, accompanied by a determination
to keep up -/the j to .the bitter
end. The correspondent continues:,
"The independent "party is believed to
have secured 100,000 new- adherents,' while
the other Liberal party has broken up.
The partisans of Kossuth have also ob
tained the upoer hand in quarters wh ...
formerly were dominated by the Social
ists."
According .'to; all reports, however, the
coalition leaders are doing everything to
keep popular excitement from reaching a
point where it cannot be controlled, real
izing that the passions of the people have
already been inflamed by the reports of
the Emneror'.s reception and treatment
of the Hungarian representatives .at
Vienna on Saturday, last, and that it
might be easy â\u25a0 to bring about an irre
parable disaster. The coalition leaders
have issued a proclamation stating that
they are determined to eschew all revolu
tionary methods. Kossuth is nuoted as
sayingr he believed that the King-Em
peror would yet change his mind and
grant concessions to Hungary. /
Both in Budapest and Vienna it Is real
ized that much depends on the outcome
of. the great meeting of all the coalition
parties to ba held at Budapest October
20, at which it is understood a plan for
legalization will be formulated.
The wildest rumors areafloat in Buda
pest. One paper publishes a statement
that the .King-Emperor intends to resign
the crown of Hungary in favor of Prince
Francis Ferdinand," and other similarly
unauthenticated statements are made.
According- to the \u25a0 consensus of -the re
ports thÂ« King-Emperor hag determined
to appoint a Cabinet, with Count Joharin
Ziehy at its head. Count Zichy is ex
pected to reach Vienna soon, but his
friends declare that he will not accept the
mission under the present circumstances.
General Baron Fejervary arrived at
Vienna last evening and it; is expected
he will have an audience of the Em
peror to-day. In well Informed circles In
Vienna the situation is regarded with a
certain amount of pessimism; but there
is an entire absence. of any definite idea
as. to' what.- Is likely to be ; the real . out
come- of the -present apparent disruption.
V'enna papers are printing reports urging
the;pÂ«*ople to be calm. . Some papers ad
vocate a i prompt rupture - and the j aban

the wrath- of the Social -Democrats by

to refuse to consent to. the introduction

uproar lasted for some time, shouts of
"withdraw. and "resign" being heard
above the general din.
The- Premier declared that he had
in no way. opposed the extension of

callod* uDon ; 'John D. Rockefeller at his
home in Forest Hall -thls'-afternoon and
through Andrew Squire.- a prominent at
torney, and L. E. Holden, proprietor of
the C^ijveland Plain Dealer,' expressed to
Rockefeller their esteem for him as a
citizen and as a great business man.
After all the guests had been presented
to Rockefeller. an adjournment was taken
to the . veranda,; and- in . the presence of
the entire assemblage,^ which had gath
ered on the lawn .immediately ; below.
Squire made an address to Rockefeller
giving expression to. words of eulogy and
regard for the man who he said .had been
a resident of the: city for fifty years.
Squire referred to the question of railroad
rate legislation saying that.it was a sub
ject which, like many others, had been
discussed "^glibly -and' thai." the loudest
declamations ~canie : from 'those who knew
least about the subject. He said the com
petition common between -producers, con
sumers and transporters did more to reg-^
ulate rates than all else. He, asked if it
was not a question whether the men en
gaged In great commercial 'enterprises
were not more entitled to monuments
than to Indiscriminate condemnation.
Squire said the principle of the "surr
vival of the fittest" is, a law too' firmly
established to be overthrown or. long de
layed even by legislative enactments. He
eald that since the organization of the
Standard Oil Company there has been no
water > on its stock. Its advent and his
tory, he said, have taught a mighty leS-:
son'ln keeping accurate account of costs
and In turning to profit all seemingly
waste products and in quietly, harmoni
ously and continuously developingjta en
terprises and supplying its patrons at
reasonable prices. - - .
After a brief address by L E. Holden,
president of the Plain Dealer Publishing
Company, in which he spoke in appreci
ation of Rockefeller's ' ' numerous bene
factions to the .city, Rockefeller made a
brief address in response to the greetings
which had been spoken.
."Turn your thoughts on the higher
things of life," said Rockefeller. . : "Be of
service* to humanity, turn. your thoughts
Into channels of usefulness, look forward
to a determination that some usefulness
shall come out of your success. *Let your
motto be 'what shall be the fruitage of

BITTER FEUD EXPECTED
Police Look for Heathen
Battles to Involve Many
Biff Chinese Societies
The volcanic forces of heathen revenge
were pent up in Chinatown yesterday, and
the pop of Chinese weapons was not
heard. The vigilance of the police, the
precautions and preparations of the tongs
â ax.d some other circumstancesâ conduced
to peace.
But It is believed that peace is only
temporary, for the young members of the
Pir.g Kongs, a. tor.g composed of many
old men of the mercantile class, were
busy tpirlting away the elders, who would
otheru-fse be easy targets for rival high
bindersâand it is believed there will be
;:erce battling later.
After hacks have taken the old men to:
the ferry, after the fathers of the Ping
Tongs are hidden in suburban towns, it
is believed that the Pings will boldly go
after their enemies of the Hip Sing Tong.
'J ne police expect several other larger as
sociations to taKe a hand in the battle be
fore the feud is quieted.
â¢ All effort to declare a truce was un
availing yesterday. A meeting was called
by the Six Companies during the after
noon and the officers of the two tongs
Tvere invited to be present. When the ap
pointed hour arrived it was found that
Horn Tie Foon. president of the Hip
Sings, was in San Jose, and that "Wong Do
Kir.g, who holds a similar position in the
2*:ng Kor.g Tong, could not be found. So
the meeting adjourned. These presidents
are now under indictment for murder, and
each is at liberty under $15,000 bonds.
Louey Bing. who shot and killed Lew
Dock Monday night, was not sent out
alone on his mission of murder. He was
accompanied by Chin Sing and Chin
Teong and each of the men was armed with
i wo revolvers. It was expected that the
merchant might have a body-guard and
those who were dispatched to kill him
prepared themselves for a battle. War
rants were sworn out yesterday by De
tective George McMahon for the arrest of
â¢.hese two men, but it is supposed that
they left the city immediately after the
shooting. --".i -
Louey was booked for murder yesterday.
His identification is positive and there
sfrms to be no loophole by which he can
\u25ba- f scape punishment. His method of dis
guising himself was unique and has never
t*?en practiced by the Chinese in high
binder wars before. His picture with wig
..n and wig off was taken by Police Pho
tographer George W. Blum and has been
placed on record in the rogues' gallery.
Two suspects who were arrested in the
Immediate vicinity of where the first
\u25a0 rime was committed were released from
custody.
Thus far there is no clue as to the iden-
Ti:y of the three Ping Kong Tong men
\u25a0a ho murdered Lee Noy on Dupont street.
All trace of them was lost in Waverly
place, and. although there were twenty
Chinese in the restaurant, the police have
bijen able, lo secure nothing definite.,.
WOMAN ARRESTED
IX SMUGGLING CASE
Accused of Aiding in the
Illegal Traffic in
SEATTLE, Sept. 26. â George Berger,
local superintendent of the Pullman
Palace Car Company, was arrested this
afternoon by customs officers on the
charge of smuggling. With him were
taken F. B. Stevens, better known as
"Big Steve." and Stevens' wife. The
customs men caught the trio at the
depot as Berger was carrying a grip
to the train for Mrs. Stevens. The grip
contained thirty pounds of opium. Ber
ger denies his guilt, saying he is a vic
tim of circumstances. The officers say
they have a strong case. *\u25a0*â¢ \
Stevens finished a term in prison last
April for smuggling more than a ton
of opium from Victoria to Seattle. All
the opium was seized at the time and
It was the largest single seizure ever
made in the United States.

POLICY HOLDERS
LOSE PREMIUMS
State* Examiner Finds Many
Contracts Worthless as
Result of Manipulation
CHICAGO, Sept. 26.â Investigation of
the affairs of the Western Life Indem
nity Company by a State examiner to-day
brought to light facts tending to show
that claims of perhaps thousands of pol
icy holders in assessment companies have
been practically. wiped out through com
pany manipulation. Examiner Lucius
Fouts discovered that no fewer than eigh
teen small insurance companies have
terminated their existence by modifying
into the Western Life Indemnity Com
pany.
"That means," said the examiner, "that
the policy holders -of the original com
panies have gone through a sort of eva
sive process, which leaves them practi
cally uninsured, although they are still
paying their premium and have been do-,
ing co for years.
"This condition is not particularly the
fault of the Western or other absorbing
companies, for the absorption is done ac
cording to law."
A new complication was added to-day
to the legal entanglement of- the Western
Life Indemnity Company. Federal Judge
C. C. Kohlsaat granted permission to At
torney Clark Varnum to file an inter
vening petition for. the appointment of a
receiver for the company. Attorney Var
num told the court he represented claim
ants who have been unable to collect in
the aggregate * $50,000 from, the Western
Life Company.
The case went to a hearing on a demur
rer Â».ied by the defendants, the demurrer
attacking not only the jurisdiction of the
court, but the form of complaint in the
bilL ;-;;'/ :v-***-r.-:.:: v-***-r.- : . : -
A charge that officers of the Western
Life Indemnity Company violated the
oral restraining order decreed by Judge
Bethca at the first hearing was made to
day before Judge Kohlsaat by Attorney
D. O. Levinson, appearing for some of
the' policy holders. The attorney- de
clared that moneys haa oeen disbursed by
the officers since the proceedings before
Judge Bethea.
Judge . Kohlsaat \u25a0 cpntinued the argu
ment until next week. \u25a0 The court in
structed the defending attorneys to let
the affairs of the company meanwhile re
main in statu quo. \u25a0â¢*, -O-.M
Charges that the company, was being
"miiked dry" were made' at 'the hearing
before Judge Kohlsaat by. Attorney
Levinson of the complaining policy-hold
ers. .
"TLo company Is paying money on its
big contracts," said Levinson, "and is
being milked dry. It'has'issued a state
ment giving its assets as $917,000 on ay L
Now the assets are $300,000."
' Levinson said that he had | been told by.
Long, formerly attorney for the com
pany, that the concern had paid the claim
of a ". bank said -to be ' involved in the
$123,00 deal; between President Rosenfeld
and Promoter. Gray. -
"The company : may. transact ordinary
business, but > the assets may not be used
for anything except to pay death claims,",
ruled Judge Kohlsaat.

FEVER GERM
MAY BE FOUND
Interest at New Orleans
Centers on Result of
Scientific Investigations
NEW ORLEANS, I Sept. 26.â More inter
est" centers here \u25a0' now In the question
whether, or not the yellow fever "germ is
to be discovered as the result of the In
vestigations that, are in progress than
the fever itself. Dr Pothier, in his re
port, says a careful study; of yellow fe
ver blood had shown a regular occurrence
of certain cells hitherto either unnoticed
or not described, which seem to be under
going development changes. In thirty
five separate cases these cells have only
once been found after the third day'* of
the fever and on the rourth. It is ad
mitted that the stegomyia only becomes
infected .if she bites the patient within
the first three days of illness. Dr. Po
thier . makes no claims : that his investi
gations have established the \u25a0 germ, but
he says that if the same cell is found
in the body of the mosquito during the
twelve days of her Infection, and if it
tallies in every respect with the cell in
the human blood,, he will be able to an
nounce his discovery. .
Though the deaths were more numerous
than Saturday, the fever situation to-day
is regarded as showing unmistakable
signs of improvement. â¢
JACKSON. Miss., \ Sept. 26.â The Mis
sissippi yellow fever \u25a0 report 'to-night

Special Dispatch to The Call.
URIAH/ Sept. 26.â Residents of Wllllts
have ' decided -to drain the \u25a0 outlet and
work on the project will' commence this
week. .What is -known as the outlet is
the channel leading -from the lower end
of | Little | Lake Valley to the headquar
ters of the Eal JBiver and through which
all the water that falls In the valley dur
ing the . rainy season . must run. This
channel is naturally small and the debris
that has accumulated in it from time Im
memorial . has so choked It that in the
rainy season \u25a0 the water spreads for miles
forming a vast " lake, and In \u25a0 several In
stances has come near flooding < the town
of Willits. which is built on hlghy ground.
The land, thus covered Is the most fer
tile land In the valley and comprises sev
eral hundred acres, but is only used for
grazing cattle a few months during the
year.. The â¢ draining of the outlet will
prevent , this land from being overflowed
and will -open, up the richest farming land
In ; Mendodno County. The amount of
yrater to be : drained can be imagined,
when it is- stated i that over forty inches

BeMef in God Declared to Be
Essential to Success of the
Sort That is Worth While
BERKELEY, Sept- 26.â 01d-fashioned
rtl.gious faith was earnestly commended
to the- university student body to-day
by William Jennings Bryan in an address
delivered by him at Harmon gymnasium,
the j)!ace being -crowded to the doors
with a typical college audience. Material
ism was scorned by the oratur as a poor
substitute for the t>itni)iÂ« faith of the
fathers, and a moral purpose underlying
etch fciudent's work in gaining and ap
jjiying an education was declared to be
hj.i essential. Bryan's insistence upon the
religious life and a "definite relation be
tween man and his Creator," with a cor
rtsjjOTidiiig tire of ridicule for callow
bkepticism apparently made a great im
prctssion upon the audience, waich, ap
parently expecting a political discussion,
bt-ard instead a discourse upon morality.
i*rcsiuent Wheeler, when Bryan had'
concluded, thar.ktd the speaker for his
aoaret* a.nd said:
"1 wish we could have such preaching
every week. It would save souls and. win
football games."
POLITICS SECOND j XOW.
Bryan arrived at the university at
neon. He took lunch with Vrefident
W" heeler and at 1 o clock was driven to
Harmon gyhnasium.
Bryan was introduced to the audience
there as a "great American citizen, who
had consistently advocated political doc
trines and taken part In political lighting,
demonstrating in all his work the possi
bilities of a good man working in politics
Xor the jgood of politics."
ilr. Bryan spoke in part as follows:
1 do not wish to dlscuse any phase of uol

ALAMEDA COUNTY GRAND
JURY FINDS GRAFT
Says Public Funds Are
Squandered by
Officers.
Body, Has Little Hope
That Report Will
Do Good.
OAK L.AND, Sept, 26.â Unwarranted ex
travagance is the keynote of the final re
port-cf the Grand Jury made _to-day after
nine month.* spent In investigrating the
affairs of the county government. From
the money expended for elections to the
erection of a nfty-foot flagpole on the
Hall cf Records, cost $291, there is said
to be waste. Toeome extent recommen
dations arc made as to how money can
be saved, while in its last breath. the re
port admits that it Is almost hopeless to
cure the evils found to permeate every
branch of the local government."
The Grand Jury that has just gone out
of- existence was impaneled on December
14 of last year and has gone into a vast
amount of facts and figures concerning
the present system of conducting the
county government. For the last few
weeks no witnesses have been examined
and it was understood that the report
was about ready to be made. After filing
the report with Clerk i-cNulty Judge
Melvin thanked the Jurors for their dili
gence and ordered them discharged from
further duty.
The report speaks as follows:
In making this report this Grand Jury de
clres to fctate by way of preface that It did
not feel it Incumbent upon itself to follow
the limited and narrow lines seemingly laid
down for its action, but has taken the broadei
position to view and investigate ail matter*
pertaining to the county -government which
might be or prove to be essential to the public
good, with the view to the correction of an
abuse or the punishment of an offense we be
lii've thjs to be the true theory for the ex
istence of a Grand Jury and have performed
out- work In accordance therewith, being con
vinced that an atmosphere of looseness and
disregard in the manasement of the pubiu
aftairp of this county ha* been created partly
by apathy of the public in county government
matters and partly by the fault of the count?
government act rather than by a defect in its
intent, which condition is largely responsible
for extravagance in the use of the public
funds and lack of system in the conduct of
Its public affairs, we believe that in- addition
to the investigation of public offensei It is
our duty to the people whom we represent to
investigate the official acts of all county of
ficers to see that the conduct of their several
office? the public business and the receiving
and expenditure of public moneys have been
performed, not alone in an honest, but also in
a prudent and efficient manner, that these in
vestigations should be as thorough aa can be
and that we report all findings of fact on
these lines to the people through this court.
XO LIMIT TO EXPGXSE.
In speaking of the County Clerk the
Grand Jury finds there Is apparently no
limit to the expense which may be in
curred in the conduct of county elections
nor can it suggest any remedy for the
abuse, but calls attention to the fact
that the last county election cost $68,224.70,
made up of the following charges: Clerks,
$4033.29; -newspapers and advertising,
$02.547.3T; booths and teaming, $$186.64;
rent and loss of furniture, $577.10; type
writing. $157.50; rent of polling places,
$1S41; delivering returns, $619; officers,
$15,303; J. B. Lanktree. $4360.91; J. P. Cook,
registering voters, $232.45; miscellaneous,
$316.Â«. \u0084 . ..... .. â¢-. .... J
Under the same heading it calls atten
tion to the fact that the county paid for
typewriting election proclamations at the
rate of 20 cents a folio for originals and
10 cents a^folio for copies, amounting to
$157.50 for. this one item alone. . .
"The report ' states that an examination
has been made of the County Infirmary,
and that while the maintenance is good
the buildings are poor, and says that on
account of the high cost of $250 a year for
each inmate it believes It would be for the
benefit -of the county if its indigent pa
tients were placed in the charitable homes
of the various private organizations at the
public expense. The salary of the Super
intendent, it finds, was increased from
$150 to $250 a month in consideration of the
fact that he would give up all outside
practice and devote his time alone to the
institution, but he has not done this, and
recommends that the excess of salary
paid him be recovered through the courts.
It also recommends that the proceeds
from the sale of products at the Infirm
ary be turned . into the county treasury
the same as other moneys.
In regard to the Receiving Hospital it
has the following to say :
4< Thi6 institution was found In a de
plorabfe condition, entirely inadequate- in
its appointments and management. The
tendency to charge expenditures incurred
for the County Infirmary to the Receiving
Hospital is reprehensible and should be
prohibited."
SAYS MONEY IS WASTED.
Attention is called to the large amount
expended annually on the county buiid
inge In th-j following language:
The large amounts expended annually for re
pairs and maintenance ot the several county
buildings warrants the belief that they should
be . In fair condition and that is the extent
of the comment of this Grand Jury. It, how
ever. fee!s constrained to add that with ref
erence to the maintenance and cleanliness " oi
the Hall of Records in particular much. is left
to be desired. A reprehensible lack of super
vision exists. With the services of a janitor
at $S5 per month and an assistant janitor at
J. 3 per month toilets are not clean: Rubbish,
esh i-ans, ash barrels and other evidences, of
unidinesk are stored and have accumulated
in the front hall adjacent to the main entrance
of this building. smgr&mmmfi
The county Courthouse has outlived Us | use
fulness and Is not at all commensurate ; with
the dignity and importance of this county, but
in view of . the undue expenditure of county
funds this Grand Jury > retrains from . any
recommendations in this regard, bat ' would
add that lor the years ISWJ to 19<H inclusive
the total repair account for four of the county
public building* amounted to $70,127 41, Item
ized a* follows, to wit: Courthouse. $36,421 21;
Hall of Records. $15.084 69; Infirmary. *IS,
6SG 72: Receiving Hospital. . 55.734 59.
The gardeners, it ; says, cost the county
$3000. while the grounds ; of the Court
house are in a disgraceful condition. â¢
In regard to an inspection made of the
facilities for fire protection in the six
theaters of the city, it states that It goes
from a good condition ;in some to a total
lack of safeguards in others, and recom
mends the framing :of a comprehensive
city theater fire ordinance. ~
It recommends the procuring of 'a safe
deposit box for the keeping of the county
funds rather than depositing the ' money
in banks, as is now done. .
It deplores the action of the Finance
Committee of the Board of ! Supervisors
for passing bills over > the head of ' the
county expert. " . . . '
RECOMMENDS SYSTEM.
In regard to - c the : recent frauds perpe
trated in reference *to the stationery ac
counts It has the following to say:;. " :
This Jury would : most earnestly recommend
that each department keep an account of tht
supplies - ordered by * It.' : - During ; the recent
investigation ,of the frauds . perpetrated ' upon
the county in the charges made for stationery

In regard to the expenditure of large
amounts .by the Supervisors it has the
following tp say:

particular line of investigation before -it be
came very | manifest "â¢ that expenditures | were
made without*' due consideration, in many in- I
stances unnecessarily, and "In most . instances I
with reckless extravagance; that ordinary ,sys- ]
terns of checking were entirely set. aside and

guidance of this county. These evidences
were of a sufficiently serious nature to war
rant a request to the District Attorney: for :
advlof ; suggestion and recommendation as -to !
what courses to pursue under certain- specific
cases presented. â¢ His answei was' most dis
couraging, hopelessly so, In :; he very begin
ning of our endeavor, In that Jt: would appear
that this Grand Jury has no right nor author
ity to pursue . these particular investigations, |
that if persisted in. they would .do no par-. ;
ticular good in that no results would follow,
and further that these official acts were be
ing done entirely within the law and as pre
scribed *by it at the discretion of ths Board
of Supervisors. This in the face of the most
glaring disregard of the proper use and ap
plication of the public funds, in violation and
open abuse of a most sacred nubile trust.
OTHER ABUSES NAMED.
The aid given to indigerits outside trie j
infirmary Dy supplying them with gro
ceries, it nnds, leads "to abuses, .and '
while only the staples are supposed to
be provided, oysters, lobsters, cream,
berries and honey are. found charged
on the bills. The requirement of hav
ing these supplies properly vouched
for by receipts was followed but once
in many hundreds of Instances investi
gated.
The executive sessions of the board
come In for the following commentary:
"Executive sessions of the Board of
Supervisors are incompatible with the
public good and should therefore be dis
continued; this is recognized ,by the
law, which provides that all meetings
must be in public or open session." '.." ,

also' says that $9 each was spent in
bronzing forty-three steam radiators,

The following 'language -is used in

The matter of mileage of each Supervisor
has been thoroughly Investigated and it would
anpear that this also was fully within the
letter of the law; nearly tlw full statutory
amount is claimed each month* and would seem
to have been fully earned lij that no doubt
nearly every Supervisor was Kept on the road
during all waking" hours -for/e^ch day in each
month during the year. We further find that
nearly every mileage account is overcharged
by a few miles.

The following brief, commentary is
made on the purchase of a flagpole for
the Hall of Records: '
It cost $291 for a - flagpole less than fifty
feet long on the County Hall of Records.
The report points, out that the Dis
trict Attorney has been directed to in
stitute proceedings looking to the re
covery of money collected by the As
sessor for making duplicate assessment
rolls for the city of, Oakland, to which
he Is not entitled. .
- In regard to the payment of bills of
one year with the funds of the next\lt
finds that last year there , were $49,000
worth of unpaid claims for the. lack of
funds, of which $37,800 were for claims
for the year before. The report, closes
with the following paragraph:
"This Jury could consume the. time of months
In similar lines of investigation of the ex

the same results as . here - outlined, that Is,
evidences of the most conscienceless use of the

MOSQUITO MAP
Unique Device- Prepared by

Campaign Against a Pest
WOMAN AIDS IN WORK
Wind's Action in Driving the
Insects to Certain Lo
calities Shown on Map
BERKELEY, Sept. 26.â A mosquito.re
lief map is the latest device originated
in the fertile brain of^ Professor C.-^M.
Woodworth, to be used by his assistants
in the campaign waged against the mos
quito pest in the region around the bay^
Professor ' Woodworth is head of the
entomological department of the
cultural coUtgc at the University I' In "
sect pests are his specialty,, and much
of his time is consumed in the planning
of 5 new schemes to circumvent the cod
ling moth, the scale pests, the devastat
ing grasshoppei, centipedes that eat as
paragusj' and lastly, though not least im
portant, the plain, ordinary mosquito' of
commerce. .
- Professor ~ Woodworth's mosquito map
is expected to aid in the work of sys
tematizing the. campaign against mos
quitoes, and giving it intelligent direction.
The map now lies on his big experiment
table, on: the second floor of the agricul
tural- college. ! Assisting him in the work
of preparing the unique, map is a woman,
Mrs. E. H." Ashman, a mosquito expert.
Her husband, a worker "in: -the same
cause, died a few months ago.
The map is made of plaster â¢of paris,
being designed to show just where the cli
matic and atmospheric conditions make
the mosquito plague greatest or less viru
lent. The plaster of paris part Is almost
finished. Arrows show" which way the
wind blows, and these arrows are one ot
the most important features of the map.
"The wind is partly responsible for a
locality's suffering from mosquitoes."
said Professor Woodwotth ..- to-day. "If
a. locality is near a marsh, as much of
thtt land infested with mosquitoes is, then
it is merely a question of how the wind
blows to determine whether the locality
In | question will suffer from the mosquito
torture.- Our mosquito map is founded
on a 'contour map we obtained from ; the
Unittd States survey. . ; \u25a0\u25a0 Â» -
"The plaster of paris shows the depres
sions, elevations, and ull .natural fea
tures of the country, around the bay.
Then the arrows indicate the direction and
prevalence of the winds,- so* we can see
at a glance where worx against mosqui
toes will be or is most needed, and plan
our campaigns accordingly."
"The new map is to be used by Profes
sor Woodworth In his lectures, and also
will be photographed' and 'Utilized in that

"OAKLAND, Sept. 26. â The marriage of Miss
Cordelia Bishop- and Dr. Harry Alderson, at
the First Congregational Church this evening,
was a"? brilliant .affair and, the many friends
who wltnefrfed ttio .ceremony will not soon 'for
get the/ vision of girlish loveliness presented by
th* brlde'and her coterie of attendants. From
the! foot or the pulpit a jperfect wilderness i of
ferns, palms arid amaryliis was built up to
the topmost ledge of the organ loft, forming
a rarely \u25a0 effective background for the dalntly
clad maids in the bridal party.
The dresses were all unusually lovely, the
bride, of course, .being the cynosure of all Â«yes.
Her gown was of creamy messallne silk,' a
bertha of point g applique draping | the bodice,
the same rare lace decorating the, skirt with
panel effect. The groom's gift, an ( exquisite
crescent of pearls and diamonds, was clasped
at her throat and a graceiul tshower of lllies
of-the-valley and' tulle tormed the bridal bou
quet. A long veil was held in place by a tiny
wreath of orange blossoms and fell in soft,
filmy folds over the graceful train.. ,:

BERKELEY. Sept. 26.â A sensation ri
valing in Interest that which followed the
announcement of W. A. McKowen's em
bezzlement of university funds was cre
ated; on the; campus this afternoon, when
the news spread that W. 8."" Cunnane, one
of 'the â¢ ;most" prominent .students In
the: college *of mining.' had floated
a quantity :of -bogus checks on
the merchants of Berkeley, then disap
peared from the university, town. Every
effort has been made to hush the story of
Cunnane's disgrace and to spare all who
are; involved or affected by hl3 wrongdo
ing. The extent of Cunnane's operations,
however. â¢ apparently, made It Impossible
to screen v the young university student
from part of the consequences of his work
or to spare his college classmates and his
family the disgrace attendant upon con
nection ! with the youth. _: Â£: :
The police have not given out. the exact
number of bogus checks nor the amounts
Involved that have been reported to head
quarters, . but it ; Is known that Cunnane.
passed much bad paper. It Is known that
the firm of F. E. Sadler, dealers In sta
tionery, were victims of Cunnane's work?
They accepted a check â¢" given them by
Cunnane, for $15, selling a small quantity
of goods and paying Cunnane the change
in coin. The check was drawn on the
First National Bank of Berkeley, which
returned it marked "No funds."
Brasfield'a barber shop, on Bancroft
way and Telegraph avenue, was victim
ized by Cunnane to the extent of $10, a
bogus check for this amount having been
accepted by BrasfieH and cashed without
questioning. The. police are believed "te
have other reports of Cunnane's work,*o-*
which other Berkeley merchants were vic
tims, but nothing is divulged by Marsha
Vollmer concerning Cunnane's operations.
Cunnane resided, at 2527 Charming way.
Inquiry at this place to-night elicited the
information that "Mr. Cunnane has left."
It* was stated at the house that Cunnane
had taken all his belongings with hlm.=
It is reported that Cunnane talked at
various times of a plan to do work for
the Southern Pacific Company, in connec
ton with his engineering studies, and it
is thought that he may have attempted to
secure some such employment in the
northern States. â¢ , â¢'\u25a0"."\u25a0 .
Cunnane's people reside in Santa Bar
bara, where is father is one of the most
prominent professional men of the city, a
physician of high standing. F. E. Sadler,
who accepted one of young 'Cunnane's bo
gus" checks, sent a telegram to Dr.-Cun
nane late this evening, asking what the
father \u25a0 wished to have done in the case.
An answer to this telegram Is awaited
by Mr. Sadler before he takes active steps
to have the young student apprehended.

CLAIMS DIVINE

Joseph ; Lachance of Mann
County, at vlnqtiest, Tells
of Eis Visions From r Above
INQUIRY-MAY BE MADE
-Facts Brought to Light as
Result of Death of George
Fabens, the Railway Man
\u25a0- . J
Special DUeatch to The Call.
SAN Sept. 26. â George C
Fabens; who for over twenty years
was claim adjuster for the Southern
Pacific . Company, and who for the last
twelve years has been a paralytic, died
at; Mount' View Hotel, the "Divine
Healers' " Sanitarium last night. The
body was \u25a0 brought! to j the morgue this
morning,'-;- and.", in ?,the'; absence of Cor
oner Sawyer, Judge I Alagee .'held an .In
quest.. Mrs. T Ollve G. Fabens, the widow
of the deceased, and her son-in-law,
Charles W. Nelson, the 1 traveling
\u25a0freight /and passenger agent of the
Illinois Central- Railroad on this coast,
were examined ; and testified that Fa
bens vhad a paralytic . stroke on the
corner of Grant avenue and Market
street, San Francisco, and had never
recovered from the effects. He had
been treated by ; many prominent phy
sicians, and they pronounced his case
hopeless. As a last resort FabenÂ» tried
the "Divine Healer" at Mount View
Hotel. .He was there six: weeks when
he died. " r-'-.
This afternoon the principal witness
at the . inquest, was the* so-called
"Divine Healer," Joseph Lachance, who,
in response to .numerous -questions of
District. Attorney Boyd, stated that he
was born in Canada and was baptized
Joseph. Lachance. For . over twenty
eight years he lived in 'Little Falls.
Minn., and followed the occupation of
a millwright and then fan a second
hand store. It was while he was run
ninglthis store, he said, that he had a
vision of an angel who spoke to him
in his home telling him to "Go. forth
and heal the sick." He received divine
commands, he said, to go to j Los An
geles, Oakland," Woodland, Esparto,
Minneapolis, St. Paul, Denver, Mount
View Hotel, near this -city, and other
points to heal the sick. -, He rarely
ever remained over a few months In
any place, he asserted, as the Supreme
Being kept him moving by his divine
commands.
Lachance declared that God gave
him the power to heal the sick by
prayer and the rubbing of his hands
on the afflicted. He testified that be
fore treating every case he' would en
ter into divine ; communication and
transmit it to his patients. The prin
cipal diseases he alleges to cure are
deafness, nearsightedness, paralysis,
stomach troubles and ' similar com
plaints:
He ? gets no. fee for treatreent, only
charging for board at "the rate of $10
per week. As there are nearly seventy
boarders at t/e institution and the fare
and equipment are. very meager, his
Income must ,be very large. When
asked by District Attorney Boyd if the
vision did not say, "Go forth and heal
the sick and thou shalt receive," La
chance went into a brown study and
did not reply. He also stated the
vision instructed him to- have/a cer
tain letter, a star, a crook and a pair
of keys on his card.
He was asked If he was a practicing
physician. . He stated that he was not
and had no certificate to practice.
Juryman B. W. Studley questioned him
about receiving the keys and he said
that they were only in the vision. He
then asked why he had not had a cer
tificate of practice given by the vision.
In regard to how he came to take the
Mount View place. : Lachance stated
that a* vision came to him In his Oak
land home and a voice said "Go to
Mount View and start a sanitarium
there." . -. :
The jury decided that death was due
tp natural causes. In connection with
the case of Lachance, District Attor
ney Boyd has addressed the following
note to the State board of medical ex
aminers:
4 There Is in Ross Valley. Marln County, a
man named Joseph Lachance, who purports to
be a "Divine Heater." He claims power to
heal the sick through prayer and laying on of
hands; that this power was given to him by a
voice nine -years apo ana confirmed by Moses
and Ellas some 'years later. He has rented a
hotel known as ' "Mount View" and has gath
ered there a number of people, about eighty In
all. that pay him $10 per week for board and
lodging only. ' He charges nothing 'for treat
ment. His influence over these people is ex
treme and he is fast gaining a reputation as a
successful healer throughout the country.
In the interest of the sick, this man should be
fully investigated and his methods brought to
light. If you care to look Into the matter I
will render, you any 'assistance In my power.
I think this ca.se demands prompt and careful
Investigation. .

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO. Sept., 28.-
A good summary of conditions now ex
isting here has been given in an editorial
of the South San Franci3co Enterprise.
Never before in its history was the town
more prospÂ«rou3 or progressive than n^r"
and the reasons are conservatively on -f^fl
lined in the following editorial:
"It does the old-timers good to see this
youny city grow. The gratifying feature
of the present activity and growth of
this place la. the entire absence of any
boom methods or tactics. There has been
no hurrah, no tooting of horns by inter
ested real estate agents, no advertising.
It Is all sound, â¢ healthy, natural growth,
based on business grounds. That the
present growth and . development' will
continue and increase Is assured by all
the circumstances and conditions which
exist. $ â¢ â¢
"First, we have the normal Increase*
of business and factories already estab
lished; second, we have two new Indus
tries located and decided which will be In
operation within the next three to six
months, viz., another brickyard and a
glue-manufacturing plant, the latter In
connection with the business of the West
ern Meat Company; third, the Bay Shore
Cut-off Railroad under construction, ana
which, when completed, will put this
city upon the main line of the Southern
Pacific's coast division railway and fif
teen minutes from the city of San Fran
cisco.
"These three factors are already ours,
and are at work Infusing life and ac
tivity everywhere. Increasing: values and
causing growth and development- With
out anything more, we are assured Of a
great development within the next twelve
months. But' there Is more," and much
more, in prospect " for this fortunate
town. The big copper smelter In all prob
ability will be located here. Indeed. Its
location at San Bruno Is regarded as
practically settled. t â¢ : ' /Ji
"It is Impossible to estimate the fUT!^
i effect of the acquisition of this mam-
I moth" industry, when consummated. Its
first and Immediate work will be to
double the number of . workmen em
ployed at this place. \u25a0 with, a high scale
of wages and with a weekly or monthly
payroll. With such an addition to our
resources we should have a safe basis
for a population of six to ten thousand
people, and our town would quickly be
come the largest town of this county."

â¢ The site and plans were agreed upon
at the meeting of the committee ap
pointed for the purpose by the .Palo

directly connected with the

Republicans of Massachu

a Lieutenant Governor
BOSTON. Sept. 26.â Although unani
caously In favor of Lieutenant Governor
Curtis Guild Jr. of Boston for Governor,
the Iff? delegates chosen at the Republl
t*Â»n caucuses throughout the State to-day
are divided between three candidates for
the second olace on the State ticket and
between four candidates for Attorney
General. With many city and town dele
rates entirely unpledged It seemed to
night that none of the prospective can
didates for Governor would be able to
claim a majority of the delegates until a
poll of the delegates on October IS.
Democratic caucuses were also held to
day In many towns. Including Boston,
Cambridge, Lawrence, Lowell, Gloucester
and Worcester. With the exception of
Cambridge, where the delegates favor
Mayor John H. H. McXunee for Gov
ernor, no preference was expressed for
the head of the ticket. To-morrow Dem
.ocratic caucuses will be held ln the re
maining cities and towns.

BRIAN TALKS
ON "IDEALS"
Thinks High Purposes
Should Be Worked Out
in the Field of Politics
William Jennings Bryan spoke for two
hours before the Young Men's Christian
Association last night on the subject,
"The Value of an Ideal." His main en
deavor was to impress the large audience
â¢which greeted him with the importance
of imprinting a high ideal into the politi
cal platform of coming campaigns and
to urge them to use their influence to
ward educating their fellows up to this
standard of political excellence. He treat
ed the subject from Its every standpoint,
showing by history and illustration just
what the ideals of certain inspired men
had accomplished In the past and ending
by painting a wonderful word portrait of
the future of this Government when It
is run by a party with a pure and un
selfish ideal.
Bryan was well received by the audi
ence. Sharp bursts of applause frequent
ly punctuated bis address. His happy de
liver}- and the pungency of many of his
sentences clearly showed how this man
had won a nomination for the greatest
office in the land by one great speech.
He alluded to his early life on the farm
and as a lawyer, and left 'the audience
anxiously wishing to learn more. In the
same way he spoke of his political ca
reer, always laughing when telling of his
two defeats. But on what he considered
the question of the day, namely, purity
in politics, he made no allusions; he
spoke from the shoulder with all the
strength of a clear mind and a vigorous
body.
He acknowledged with praiseworthy
frankness that he waa a politician. "Yes,
I am," he said, "and I am proud of It.
I offer no apology for being interested in
the science of government. It is a great
science and one greatly needed in this
country to-day. People should mix in
politics; thrush; their children into the
arena. It is good for them, good for you.
The man who says that politics is too
poor for him to mix in is too poor to mix
with it. Go Into politics to uplift It, not
to pollute it by your presence. I got Into
politics by accident and stayed there by
design. The election of to-day is getting
to be an auction, a sale to the highest
bidder. This is what we must eliminate
from our parties. I want to build a party
ideal which will bo backed by a senti
ment too strong to be boughtâ an unsel
fish desire to have a good Government.
Then, and then only, not by . armies or
navies, but by example, will" we become
the conquering nation of the earth."
Digressing a little from his announced
subject Mr. Bryan dealt exhaustively
with the Idea of Initiative and referen
dum. "This sentiment is growing." he
announced. "It is shown by the agitation
in favor of electing the Senators directly
by the people. I want the psople to have
what they desire in party government; I
believe in It so thoroughly that I am will
ing to have every question referred to
them for final settlement. Let the people
have what' they want, no matter what it
is. If they want an unheard-of x money
standard, give it to them. If they want
trusts let them decide, and then' give
trusts to them.'-'.
The silver advocate paid a high tribute
to President Roosevelt for his work In
the recent peace negotiations, stating
that it had brought great prestige to
the United States. ;
A reception was tendered Mr. â¢ Bryan by
the Press Club. There he made a short
speech and was introduced to the mem
bers by President "John McNaught.
, At the Iroquois Club he declared that
the ' Democratic party- took a backward
step' last /fall:/ fall : when it sought to win by
compromise and equivocation.
" Yesterday afternoon' Mr. Bryan was
tendered a reception at the. St. Francis
Hotel. To-day he leaves - with his wife
and daughter for a visit in Japan.

Client, E J. Einmoiis, Now
Beino: Tried for Bribery
ALDEN ANDERSON
ON WITNESI STAND
Lieutenant Governor States
That tli c Committee Was
Not; Named Upon Advice
of Any One on the Outside
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 26.â The prose
cution to-day rested its case against
ex-Senator E. J. Emmons, charged with
accepting a brfte during the last ses
sion of the State Legislature. The
most interesting event of the session
of court to-day was the opening state
ment of Grove L. 1 Johnson, who enume
rated the propositions he expected to
prove. The closing witnesses for the
prosecution added little to the evidence
already presented and the witnesses for
Emmons were called to contradict or
dispute matters already before the
jury. Johnson's address was in part
as follows: : ; :;' V-^v"
I shall briefly outline, on behalf of the \u25a0 de
fendant, the reasons â¢ that actuated the objec
tions and cross-examinations we have pre
sented. In considering the testimony we ex
pect to show by competent witnesses that this
defendant never entered into agreement on the
18th day of January to do anything wrong as
a State Senator. We expect to show that the
testimony of Bunkers was false, . made out of
whole cloth and wholly destitute of truth.
We shall" also show that the first meetinK of
the committee lasted but a half or three-quar
ters of an hour Instead of until 11 o'clock. We
shall show that this first meeting was devoted
to organization only, and we shall show this
not by the defendant alone, but by disinter
ested people who waited for members of the
committee.
We shall show that this defendant came to
the meeting of 'the Legislature Justly and nat
urally offended at the Continental Building
and Loan Association because of Its treatment
of himself and his family, and because it tried
to deprive him of a home. We shall prove
that Gavin McNab was attorney for the asso
ciation In that suit, and knew of it, and that
his testimony, to put it mildly, was a mis
take; that there was no foundation for the
testimony of McNab to the effect that the
committee was Dacked.
AGAIX ACCUSES GRANGE.
We expect to show that the defendant had
nothing to do with his appointment as a mem
ber of this committee; that he had nothing to
do with the Examiner, but was, on the con
trary, on unfriendly terms with that paper.
We shall show that the prosecution ls car
ried -on. not on behalf of this county, which la
expected to pay the very large expenses of the
trial, but on behalf of the Continental Asso
ciation. We expect to prove that the commit
tee started to investigate the building and loan
associations in good faith; that there was no
talk of the defendant with \u25a0 Bunkers> or Jor
dan save on legitimate business; that there
was no talk of a. bargain or agreement and that
this defendant did not ask or receive a bribe.
We expect- to prove- that the defendant
did not receive the money said to have been
given him at either place ' spoken of, and we
expect to show by reputable witnesses that
Hartling and Tichenor ' are men without repu
tation, whose . neighbors would not believe
them under oath.
We shall 6how that the testimony of Arthur
P. Lee, the American citizen of African de
scent, U absolutely false and shall contradict
It in evÂ«ry important detail. :
We ext>ect to prove that Clarence Grange
was an accomplice in the alleged crime, and
that far from soliciting money for tho pur
pose of entrapping members of i the Senate,
Grange solicited money to bribe, buy and
protect the companies, and that the , men he
visited refused to have anything to do with
him. He was an accomplice. His testimony,
like that of Bunkers and Jordan, is absolutely
of no weight. . ' , *
We shall confidently expect to receive a
verdict of not guilty at your hands, restoring
this defendant to hie wire, his child and
friends, freed from all the stains attempted
to ba caet on him by any of his enemiee ln
this transaction.
ANDERSON TESTIFIES.
Before making his address Johnson
moved to strike out the testimony of
Witnesses Russell, Grange, Tichenor,
Older and Heinz in regard to Russell
receiving any money and to strike out
the testimony of McNab,. Bunkers Jor
dan and Lee for other reasons. The
motions were denied.
Alden Anderson, Lieutenant Governor
of California, was the first witness
called for the defense. He testified that
it was his duty to preside over the
Senate and appoint the^comittees; that
he appointed the Committee on Commis
sions and Retrenchments. Anderson
stated that the defendant had not asked
to be appointed on the. committee..
"Was that committee paqked by you
in the interest of anybody?" was asked.
"No," was the reply.
"Did any one from the Examiner use
any influence to select the committee?"
"Absolutely no," was the answer. "It
was supposed to have been an incon
sequential committee, and I think out
of forty Senators I received' one request
to be appointed. I gave the Sergeant
at-Arms no instructions to locate com
mittees ln any particular place outside."
J. Louis Martin, sergeant at arms of the
Senate, Charles H. Hogg and Joseph
Truite testified. Truite denied giving Lee
any money.
QUESTION OF SIGNATURE.
E. A. Puschell of Bakersfleld, who came
to Sacramento with; Emmons on Septem
ber 9 and lodged with . him at an uptown
hotel, was the first witness called this
morning. The purpose '. of putting Pu-"
schell on the stand was to prove Em
mons* signature.- Puschell said ha 'did
not rcsrister at the hotel, .neither did he
see Emmons register. The : hotel register
was then sent for and a short recess was
taken pending the arrival of a witness
for the prosecution.
; Upon reconvening Puschell was again
called to the stand and he was shown
the hotel register., He said j that neither
the entry of Emmons nor his own name
had been made by him.' Seymour then
offered. the entry of Emmons',,name as an
example of the defendant's handwriting.
Johnson objected and \u25a0 called James L.'
Flannigan, the clerk of the hotel, to the
stand. Flannigan told Tof the busy times
about the j hotel iby reason !of -the large
number of arrivals for the electric,carni
val. Flannlgan said he \u25a0: could ; not tell
whether Emmons 'registered for * himself
and Puschell \or.whetner J he ; had regis
tered at all. " Flannlgan said in ' answer
to questions by District; Attorney : . Sey
mour, and against r an,objection v by John
son that 'Attorney j:R. : Platnauer,_who ; is
associated with : the \u25a0 prosecution, visited
him , yesterday and " asked if ,he { believed
a certain I entrjr in the register -, had > been
made by Emmons.: Flannigan; f said 'he
told Platnauer he \was \ not '- positive, "but
believed Emrnons had . made the entry. ; \

MR. BRYAN'S VISIT.
MR. BRYA.N has sojourned briefly in San Francisco, and is
on a tour of the world, seeking material for use in journalism
and politics. There is every reason to believe that his stay
here has been pleasant He has received every mark of respect due
to his high and sound personal character. . In his public appearances
in this city and at Berkeley he has been listened to with interest, and
his countrymen have noted with pleasure that his oratorical gift for
investing with interest every subject upon which he speaks has
been ripened and strengthened by time.
In one of his Berkeley addresses he took occasion to declare his
submission to the will of the majority in the affairs of the republic.
He did not withdraw his right to persuade the majority and influence
its decision. So far in his public experience his advice has been uni
formly rejected, but that is no reflection upon his sincerity. In one
respect he sets an excellent example to American politicians. He is
not hidebound in his partisanship. Once there was a Kentucky Dem
ocrat who refused to go down the Ohio Rive.r on a steamboat named
"Henry Clay." But Mr. Bryan would sail to the Orient on a steamer
named "Theodore Roosevelt" and enjoy the voyage just as much
as if the boat were the "Grover Cleveland."
He does not hesitate to approve the acts of the President and
declare that he will support his major policies. This amiable dispo
sition is distempered somewhat by the "qualification that the Presi
dent's policies resemble his own. As this resemblance is not visible
to the common eye, it may be said, by those who want to carp, tha^
Mr. Bryan is seeking an excuse "for doing a good thing, which does
not exist. We do not think that this is true. Mr. Bryan is not yet
past the imaginative age. Indeed it is his tropical imagination that
gives its charm to his oratory. He sincerely believes that his cher
ished views are being carried out by the President, and believing
this he says it, and takes the consequences. In his two campaigns,
when he presented himself as the supporter of the views of Jefferson
and Lincoln in money and finance, he believed it arid his conjuring
with the two great names was sincere. But his countrymen thought
otherwise.
As a private citizen Mr. Bryan is an interesting and exemplary
figure. In personal character he is far above reproach and suspicion.
His ideals are high and his advocacy of them^is art of a high order.
He understands, perfectly, rhetoric ?.s an art of persuasion. Yet
there is something lacking. Who can tell what it is? His high
minded leadership has wrecked his party, and his political enemies
put that among his most important public services. He is the most
alluring and interesting enigma that has ever appeared in American
politics. Perhaps he has furnished the key to the puzzle in one of
his newspaper interviews in this city. He characterized, properly, the
men whose manipulation of finance and life insurance in New York
is now being exposed, and assumed that he was right in his policies
and platforms because these men opposed him. That is illogical.
Principles are not made right nor wrong because of perfection or
imperfection in the characters of those who support or oppose them.
Free silver was not right becaus? Mr. John A. McCall opposed it.
Nor was the gold standard wrong because Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan
supported it.
There is nothing in anything except the reason that is in it.
As. far as Wall street speculation is concerned it would have gone
on just the same if Mr. Bryan had been President. When specie
payment was suspended during the Civil War and greenbacks were
the circulating medium Wall street speculated. The "Black Friday*
fell upon the country when paper currency was full legal tender. The
juggling with the trust funds of the great life insurance companies
would have been just as easy and quite as reprehensible if the funds
had been in silver or paper as it was with gold. The assumption that
honesty consists of the kind of money that is handled has no support
in fact or logic. Supporters of Mr. Bryan have doubtless stolen
horses, got drunk, beaten their wives or embezzled, but it would be
foolish partisanship to say that his principles were therefore wrong.
He was supported by many good men and by many bad men. The
same was true of Major McKinley, in the two campaigns in which
they confronted each other.
It has never happened and will never happen in any national
campaign that all the moral men of the country will be 'on one side
and all of the immoral on the other. Political principles of the best
kind may be supported by the worst men, while very good men may
support very bad political principles. It is his apparent failure, to
comprehend this that may account for Mr. Brian's ill success in poli
tics. It is lack of logical reasoning processes. His countrymen like
him immensely as a man. They admire him as a fellow citizen. But
they distrust his judgment as a statesman. They are in the same at
titude toward him as the old lady to her husband, when she said, "I
love every bone in his body, but I don't like his tarnal ways."
THE COST OF LIVING.
FROM 1893 to 1596 great complaint Was made in this country of
the low price of the staple necessaries of life. f T^e depression
in price was a prominent incident of the panic which raged in
those years. Now the price of the same staples is high, and com
plaint is made because it is high. Yet air of our people live on a
much higher scale than Europeans. The immigrants who come here
in swarms escape from low wages and high price of food, to find
higher wages and better food cheaper.
. The United States Consul at Chemnitz, Germany, in a recent
report dissipates one false idea prevalent in this country, that living
is cheaper in the German states than in the United States. Food is
higher there than here. Tea, coffee, sugar, butter, meat, poultry and
potatoes all list higher than here. Germany produces only 75 per
cent of the food consumed, by her people. That the rest is imported
and pays duty may have something to do with the higher price. The
laboring people there have to abstain from the kinds of food that
are on every table here. They live on fish, herring, cheap cuts of
meat and the cheaper vegetables. '\u25a0-", -, - .
A Chemnitz paper publishes from a workingman's expense book
the yearly outlay for food used by a family consisting of the father,
mother and several children, number and age not stated, but, as
German families are large, it may be assumed at; five. The yearly
expenditure was. for rye bread, $44 88; white bread, $20 34; meat,
S9 go; sausage, $7 64; bacon, $10 85; butter, $21 27; eggs, $4 10;
milk; $18 85. It will be seen that bread and butter are the princi
pal articles of diet, costing $86 49, while meat in all forms was in
dulged in only to the extent of $28 39. The outlay for, vegetables is
not given, but that for the articles named, being only $137 J2, means
pinching of the most rigid sort, and a conflict between high prices and
low wages. . :~ *:
In a report made by a committee of the United State's Congress
in 1892, the expenditure of a normal American family for, the'. same
articles in the German list was only $116 63. That was immediately
preceding the panic when prices were high, but the outlay bought
more of each article than the larger sum buys in Germany. A com
parison of the list of articles in the German and American' dietary
shows a much more extensive variety of food in -this country, com
monly used on the tables of workingmen, especially in fruits and veg
etables. At the present time the same amount of money furnishesta
more plenteous table in this country than in Germany, though bur
prices have advanced.

WHY MR. ROCKEPMER BOUGHT A WIG
Young Men as
Dressmakers
t Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd, writing of
"The Artist Dressmakers of Paris," In
the October Everybody's, says:
â¢ "Attractive young men stand at the
head of many of the most famous dress
making houses.
"Doeuillet is one of the most typical
of the group. He is housed in one of
the historic palaces of the Place Ven
dorae, where he has the most superb
establishment in Paris. The work
turned out harmonizes with the setting.
Elaborate confections are Doeuillet's
specialty, his prices are monumental,
and his clientele is'made up from what
one of his rivals has called 'the swell
mob,' meaning the rich and extravagant
as distinguished from the exclusive and
chic.
"But if one speaks of Doeuillet to one
of his patrons, it is riot of his frocks
one is likely to hear, but of his beaux
ycux â 'An Adonis, ma chere. Such a
manner, such a figure, such eyes! â -Ah!'
"Francis is another of the charmers,
and like the others he backs, up his
charms by ability. The French version
of the tailor-made is his province. :
"Armand is. the baby. in. point of pro
fessional career, the most recent addi
tion to the new school. It is now sev
eral years since he rose above the busi
ness horizon, but;it took him less than
one year. to climb to giddy heights. He
was an unimportant salesman. Nine
months later, he was proprietor of a
famous dressmaking establishment oc
cupying the old Sa ye .Palace on the
Place Vendomc, the palace In which
Napoleon the Little and Eugenic first
met. Once more a triumphant com
bination of business ability and beaux

.PHILOSOPHER "AND HIS FATE.
IN a cot , at Boggses' : Corners, wnen a
: little boy was 1/ .
Lived a chap named Obed Simpson who
-could lore for all supply.
He could, tell you howthe'systems with
out jaror friction run, '
And'cculd also make suggestions bow the
thing-were better done:
He could tell how stars planets in
" their orbits smoothly ran, .'
And could hint to the Creator some im
provements on His plan; .
Of mortal lore' he, knew the full, the laws
of fate and chance, ,
But hla : genius shone the brightest when
he discoursed "of feenance. . ' .
.; For, he knew our banking system
. To a dot or to at; ' ,
He could name our bond? , and list 'em,
And' his startled me.
Old Obed Simpson used to sit upon a
. . dry-gocds.box,
Expatiate on systems and undo their
varied locks
For us fellows at tha Corners. In the
meantime -.Obed's farm
Went unto .rack and -ruin, while we
viewed with mÂ»ch alarm
The picture that .he drew for us. .We
didn't give a whoop, i
For what was nne , farm * more or less
when. all were "in the soup?"
And; it used to thrill us, deeply when he
' made- old Logic "prance, .
As he gave consideration to the subject
.. of feenance. . â¢ ;"â¢
Oh. our eyes no common meas'rer
Could have measured as they grew,
When he told the nation's Treasurer
Of the things he ought to do.
Some twenty years or more had gone
since Obed last I heard.
When *I wandered to the Cornersâ a trip
o'er long deferred â
And I missed his prattle sorely; his wis
dom, too, I missed;
No more he showed his country's faults
In a sepulchral list.
"Oh, where is Obed?" I exclaimed. "Alas!
and is he dead?" . ..
A weary, olden â¢ resident upraised his
frosted head.
"Waal, sence you ask," he then replied,
â¢ "you needn't feel no care,
Fer I reckon that you'll find him In the
poorhouse over there.".
Oh, many a man since time begun
Could tell me why and nowâ
But Obed's not the only one
Who's in a poorhouse now!

I hear that you held four aces in a
little game last night, Adolphus, and
that they netted you $18 70, and, as a
consequence, you" are looking quite
wise, cunning and more than" humanly
sagacious this morning."! am extending
my congratulations, my boy; you cer
tainly are a reach.
-. But let us suppose a, case: Suppose
that a wise man and a congenital Idiot
sat down to play cards, and the cards
were dealt fairly; which would have
the better chance of drawing four
aces? It would be a "stand-off" be
tween the wise man and the Idiot,
would It not? l.That is, supposing the
cards were, dealt honorably, and. I
would* not dishonor you by supposing
anything else. â¢
Why,. then, should not the idiot con
gratulate himself on his cunning, if he
wins, as much as the wise man? What
cunning .does- it; show? What skillâ
unless .the .winner is a. knave, which,
of course/ you are not?. As a matter
of fact, : it shows none; does it?
,Of course, you are cunning, dear boy;

DEVOLUTION 18 AT HAND
Overthrow of the Autocracy
Precursor of Democracy
in All Western Europe
BY LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
Under the etars and Etripes that
Btretcht-d prophetically across the stage
in the Turk-street Temple, the shrine
of the Socialist, the downfall of Rus
sia was last night thrown upon the
Ecreen of men's minds. It was as the
handwriting upon the wall in the pal
aoe of Belshazzar. i
It had been announced that Anna
Strun^ky would speak â the inspired
little Russian girl whose Email body
sffms inadequate for the great pulsing:
soul it holds.
The meeting was announced as a
gathering: of German Socialists for the
purpose of expressing sympathy with
the rebelling Russian people, and to
raise funds for the cause.
-It was called to order by I. Shif, an
intrnse German brother, who made a
lurid speechâ two in fact, for one was
in German â declaring- that since peace
ful pleadings with the Government had
b^en without avail, but one other
method now remained â the dynamite
and gunpowder method.
r>d and revolutionary?
Bather, but isn't that how all mon
archies have been upset?
After gathering: a goodly sum in con
tributions for the Russian brethren that
are making the right for liberty, the
chairman presented Miss Strunsky.
Small, with dark skin and masses of
blavk hair and eyes that reflect the
potentiality of her soul â which is more
than mere mmd â this little woman
talked for nigh unto an hour, pointing
with prophetic finger to the great im
pending revolution in her native land,
and the incidents and conditions that
led up to it.
"The revolution in Russia Is with us,"
eaid she, "and it is but the vanguard
of a revolution all over Europe. It be
gan with the dawn of the nineteenth
â¢ century, and It grew in spite of the
knout, the prisons, Siberia and the gib
bet, until 1861. when the serfs were
nianc jp ated â that Is> tbey were p O ii ti _
!y freed, lut remained economic
slaves. But the principle of manhood
was enunciated.
"Then came the fall of Sebastopol, when
tsip nihilistsâ a body of students and pro
feseioaa] men and women who had risen
t<< demand srlf-expression^allied them-
Bdrea together in common cause. They
had seen tbe futility of peaceful pleading
and they resolved to killâ to kill off the
monsters of the bureaucracy who daily
Kent patriots to their deaths or to dun-
E<"ons. As to the ethics of this, I will
leave that for you to decide. Spilling
blood is bad, but what great political
evolution ever occurred without it?"
Wiih eloquence that plowed with the
intensity of her patriotism. Miss Strun
eky tuJd the tale of Vera Sassulich. the
you&s society girl who turned nihilist
through persecutions, and of her killing
of the Governor of her proivnee after
ytars of suffering at his hands, and of
her acquittal in a trial by jury, which ob
literated thereafter that method of trial.
Th<n the speaker dwelt upon the propa
ganda carried on among the serfs by the
students and the professional men and
women, and the awakening to their
rights to liberty and happiness. And the
army, long the bulwark of autocracy,
was pointed out to be honeycombed with
socialism, even to the extent that In 1902
Grnerai Kuropatkin sent out a warning
to commanders all over the Slav empire.
And herein lies the reason why in the
late war victory was often turned to de
feat by the Russians turning about and
running away, preferring a defeat for the
I Government they hate, knowing that
J each defeat would bring them nearer the
* democratic government they dream of.
And thus were the conditions of Slavic
unrest demonstrated and the imminent
outburst of the people forecasted.
And it surely looked bad for Russia
B.nd the poor little Czar last night. He
*as hit hard.

TETRAZZINI'S
ART ASCENDS
In "Traviata" She Goes
Nearer Than Ever to the
Stars and Moves Auditors
A performance as smart as Tetrazzini's
gowns was that of "La Travlata" last
night at the TlvolL As last season, "La
Travlata" is one of Polacco's most suc
cessful revivals.
The trivial old turn-turn of the orchestra
âIn the careless readings to which one
has been so haplessly accustomed, be
comes a thing of infinite gayety and
sparkle in Polacco's hands. Its every note
glitters. Almost Mozartean in its fresh
ness the opera becomes. One would give a
good deal to hear a "Don Giovanni" from
Signor Polacco.
To me Tetrazzini is a little at her best
here. Her Lucia is a wonderful perform
ance; and a pretty trick of comedy makes
Tetrazzini's Rosina a thing wholly de- j
lighlful. But as Violetta the little diva
wheedles the quite unusual tear from the
grand operatic eye. She brings a pathos
as rare as it Is effective to the acting of
the role. "La Traviata" is conspicuously
more human throughout as Polacco has
set It before us; but as in the scene be
tween Violetta and Armand's father one
forgets that it is opera in the realism that
both bring to the scene. With the Bazelli
scenes it was different. Possibly Bazelli
was lamenting bis lost mustacheâ he did
not quite arrive at any larger tragedy.
In beautiful voice was the little prima
last night. One sits back with ut
most comfort to hear her, sure of the
pitch, sure of the uppermost upper note,
sure of the pure dazzlement of the voice,
of the lovely, lovely ease of the singing.
I Her "Fors' c lvi" was splendidly given,
and the aforesaid duet with Germont
(Gregoretti) a truly enchanting perform
ance. Mme. Tttrazzini is there to be
looked at this week, too, in a charming
repertoire of gowns. The first, a thing
of moonlight and dew, looks as if she
had sung it.
The honors of the evening also went
heavily Gregorctti's way last night." The
baritone was in splendid fettle, his voice ;
the smooth, velvety, resonant organ one
so gratefully remembers it. Quite the
best Ckrmont of my experience vocally.
It was also furthest from the vocal un
dertakers one remembers of the Germont
procession.
Bazelli, as always, sang â¢ with pretty
lyricism, but was under the usual ban
of the part. His first act was much the
best his "O Mio Rimorso" handsomely
sung. But Signor Bazelli is o'er cheerful
for a despairing liver in the next act, and
lacks flre in the gaming scene. He
needs to bring some of the vim of his
spirited Duke in "Rigoletto" to the per
formance. '
Signor Cervl looks slightly more like a
waiter than a baron as the Dauphol, but
fills In acceptably, as do the rest of the
people, the chorus again scoring heavily,
'ihe opera will be given again on Satur
day afternoon.
This evening "11 -Trovatore," with Pe
trella, Angiolettl, Moreo and Grassi will
be sung. .

ILLTJSTKATED LECTUEE
History of the Old Missions
Told by the Congress

Congressman Julius Kahn gave an
illustrated lecture on the old missions
of California last evening in Native
Sons' Hall, 414 Mason street, for the
benefit of the Youths' Directory. It
covered a great deal of the early his
tory of California. Of the twenty-two
missions built between the years. 1769
and 1823 Mr. Kahn had views of
eighteen, which he presented \u25a0 last
evening.
During the course of the address Mr.
Kahn stated that many of the old mis
sions were In fair condition and used
as churches at the present time, while
others were in ruins, and two, San
Rafael and Santa Cruz, had disappeared
entirely. He stated that the California'
Landmarks League has undertaken the
restoration of the old mission fof San
Antonio Padua and intended to take up
other work as soon as funds could be
collected for such work.
When California became a part of
the United States many of the old mis
sions'were sold and are still held in
private ownership. _ In several ' In
stances their owners have expressed
determination, to- restore them to their
former condition and thus . preserve
them for future generations. The
speaker said all such historic land^

Leon 8.-Newton, Ex-Convict,
â¢ Discovered to Ec Member
of Noble British Family
ALAMEDA, Sept. 26.â After betraying
the confidences of his benefactor and be
ing arrested for burglary, a man who has
been known as L. B. Neate was revealed
to-night as Leon B. Newton, -the erring
son of Sir Edwin Newton, K. C. 8., a peer
of Great Britain and a member of She
British House of Lords. /
A letter found on Newton by the police
disclosed the prisoner's identity. The
message was addressed to Sir Edwin New
tion as "Dear Father" and was signed
Leon B. Newton.
The prisoner explained in his letter that
he had been a long time away from home
and he Intended to write only a few lines
to tell his people he was still in the land
of the living.
Though only 29 years old, Newton holds
a criminal record. He was discharged
only a short time ago from the State
Penitentiary at Folsom, having served a
term for burglaries . committed in San
Francisco. His descent into crime again
is the result of help given him by Ernest
Mayrlsch of 2223 Buena Vista avenue.
Alayrisch was formerly a guard at Fol
som and there Â»became acquainted with
Newton. After the young man was freed
ho hunted up Mayrlsch. Three weeks ago
he met the former guard, explained his
circumstances and declared his purpose
to turn over a new leaf. Mayrlsch be
lieved the ex-convict and opened his doors
to the young and apparently contrite man.
Newton was given a home until he should
get on his feet. He rewarded his friend
by robbing him. ;
Newton had gone to San Francisco
every day during his stay with thÂ© fam
ily. This morning he departed as usual,
but took with him two grips, laden with
gold quartz specimens which he stole
from a cabinet in the Mayrisch parlors.
He also removed the gems from a dia
mond ring belonging to Mrs. Mayrlsch
and uisposed of the plunder in San Fran
cisco. Mrs. Mayrisch missed the ring
and the specimens this afternoon. She
sent for the police. When Newton re
turned to-night, he was met by Detective
George Brown and arrested.
The prisoner confessed and was taken
to the City Prison. After , giving the
name of Neate he was searched and
the letter was discovered. : Newton . ad
anitted the Identity as thus disclosed and
further admissions were made" ito - May
risch along the same line. Newton had
confided to Mayrisch ; that he g a
wayward son, had fled from England and,
after falling Into bad company!* and evil
ways, had tried to bury hia \u25a0 identity
Newton would not talk about his family*
further than to assert his claim to the re
lationship that his unmailed letter had
disclosed. The clothing he wore had be
longed to Ed Smith, the defaulting Tax
Collector of San Francisco, as did one of
the grips, which he used to carry off his
plunder in to-day. Smith had formed a
friendship for Newton at â¢ Folsom, and
gave him the ; articles. \u25a0 ,

PLAN TO HELP
JUVENILE COURT
Auxiliary Committee to Be
Chosen to Give Assist
ance to Judge Murasky
INITIAL MOVE/IS MADE
Project Is Enthusiastically
Discussed at a Meeting
Held at the Palace Hotel
The first definite move . in - the direction
of \ \u25a0 forming a permanent organization
that will undertake the correction of the
morals of the city's wayward youth was
made last evening at a meeting* held in
the Marble, 1 Hall of the Palace Hotel.
Assembled there . were a number of the
most prominent people of San Francisco
who, are interested in the work; of the
â¢tfuvenile Court, of wnich Judge Frank J.
Murasky is the head.
Judge William P. Lawlor presided and
addressed the assemblage on the purpose
of the gathering. He reviewed the la^w
under which the court was created in
1903 and of. the duties of the court rela
tive to. youthful offenders under the age
of 16 years. He also told of the amend
ments made to the law jby thje^ last Leg
islature, wherein provisions were -made
for applying probation to cases of offend
ers over the age of 16. Under the amend
ments the Superior Court was required
to appoint a probation committee of seven
citizens, and the Judge stated that this,
requirement had been carried out by the
local department of the I State Judiciary
in. the selection of the following ladies
and gentlemen for that .purpose: Fred
J. Koater, chairman; "James R. Pringle,
secretary; Dr. Dorothea Moore, Edwin
\V. Newhallj John S. Drum, Jesse W.
Lillenthal and Mrs. Margaret Dean. .
This committee, which has charge of
the work of all the probation .' officers
and approves of their appointments, had
been meeting for several nights and had
decided to arouse a greater interest in
the community in the welfare of the
youth of San Francisco. Toward that
end, Judge Lawlor stated, he, had ad
dressed letters to a number of persons
who ha was assured were interested in
the work of the Juvenile Court, notifying
them that they would be .chosen to act
as an auxiliary committee ' to assist in
the furtherance of the good work, and
inviting them to the meeting. He ex
pressed his pleasure at the response his
call had received, and in conclusion he
introduced Judge Murasky, who reviewed
the history of the Juvenile Court. Dur
ing the short life of the court, less than
three years, Judge Murasky said that he
had passed upon 2000 cases and had ob
tained encouraging results. Following his
remarks, which aroused the enthusiasm
of those present, there was a general dis
cussion of plans for the organization \of
an auxiliary committee and the scope of
its work. Among those who participated
in the discussion were Justice and Mrs.
Ralph C. Harrison, Andrew M. Davis,
Mrs. A. F. Morrison, A. I. Esberg, Ru
dolph Herold Jr., Mrs. Lowenburg, Clar
ence W. Walter. William . Haas, R. E3.
Queen, Mrs. Bettie Ashe. James B. Smith,
Charles Carpy, Albert Meyer and Mrs. A.
R. Cotton." ~ ' ' '
It was" finally resolved to appoint a com
mittee of seven to look after the finan
cial end of the cause and raise the neces
sary funds for promoting the work of the
organization, and another committee or
seven to plan the committee's work.
Judge Lawlor announced that he would
select these committees during the week
and notify those present of the fact, so
that another meeting can be held at an
early date. He also said that he 'was
satisfied that the selection of an auxiliary
committee f rom â¢ among the citizens of
this city would greatly augment the in
terest In the work oi the Juvenile Court
and more readily enthuse the public-spir
ited citizens over" the projected detention
and parental homes which are absolutely
necessary in San Francisco, where crime
develops in th eldleness encouraged
in many instances among juveniles by
reason of a lack of manufacturing insti
tutions and the absence of proper care at
home. â¢

Special Dispatch to The CalL
VALLEJO. Sept. 26.â The flght in the
ring between Fred Landers and Toby.
Irwin to-night was a tame affair when
compared with the riot which followed
the defeat of Irwln.
He -was outclassed from the start by
Landers and did not have a chance to
â¢win. Landers was a 6to 10 choice in the
early betting., but when Irwln entered
the ring and his poor condition was noted
the price dropped at once to 3 to 10.
Landers was beat in? down his old op
ponent steadily until the ninth round. At
this stage of the fight Irwln began to
foul his antagonist. Referee Bob Mac-
Arthur "warned him several times. His
warning went unheeded, as Irwln ap
parently wanted to lose on a foul and
thus say* himself from belns knocked
out. When he again struck Landers low
Mac Arthur Etopped the ftght and gave
the decision to Landers.
\u25a0The- seconds jumped into the ring and
hot words passed between Irwin and
Harry FcOey. who was handling Landers.
Irwin struck Foley and precipitated a
free-for-all flpht. The police then jumped
into the ring and restored peace.
Kavanagh, a local man, refereed the
preliminaries. He called the bout be
tween. T. West and D. Murray a draw.
The spectators thought West won and
eald so loudly.
Jack Murphy knocked out Ed Lennon in
three rounds.

street Is down and the "Kid" has re
nounced prize-fighting forever.
'"It's a crime to allow prize-fights." paid
McCoy to-day. "It's a crime not only
against men who slug and punch each
other for mere money, but It's high trea
son ag-ainst the citizenship of the country.
The men v?ho are responsible are State
Senators and legislators who frame the
statutes making: it lawful.
"Not only will I never fight again, but
I will do txl\ 1 can to have prize-fighting
declared unlawful.
."Why don't I go on the lecture plat
form? Well I have thougrht of that." said
Se!by, thoughtfully. "After my season
In vaudeville I may do so. I am willing
to talk to any T. M. C. A. on these lines.
I got my flrst training In the Y. It C. A.
In Louisville and have always had a
\rarm feeling for the organization. How
ever, I'm not a member of anj- church."

. Billy i>elaney : lias ' stated " that he
would match Al Kaufmann against any
man in the ring, if his. protege is suc
cessful'ln. the contest with" Foley. - It
is thtis possible that Kaufmann will be
matched^ to box ..Marvin = Hart., the
nominal holder" of the .title. This being
the, case," Kaufmann is- apt to be "sent
right tOj. the front at a single bound
and thus 'in a few short month* be
fated a "goad enough opponent, for Jef
fries to come 'out of retirement to meet.
. There are still many" good judges "who
believe -Foley has an 'excellent chance to
â¢win- the . bout with Kaufmann. .'They "base
tliefr on the fact that Foley'.s su
perior ring generalship and cleverness are
more "than "a match for the hltting.power
with whlch'-young Kaufmann fa endowed.

fast work such as ball punching and
shadow sparring. Four rounds of boxing
with big . Joe Kennedy and two - rounds
with Willie Fitzgerald were gone through
fast and the work was light compared to
what: it had been the previous day. The
drying which Kaufmann has
been taking the past day or two has
brought - his weight down and Delaney

Foley's work consisted of four rounds
of boxing with Jack Johnson, three
rounds with Joe Thomas and then he
took turns at punching the bag and shad

ARRIVES FROM PANAMA
Liner Alameda Brings Many
Japanese From Honolulu
and a Large Cargo
The Pacific Mail Company's liner City
of Para arrived yesterday from Panama
and way ports. The passengers were
transferred to the tug Arabs off Meiggs
wharf and landed at the Pacific Mail
wharf. The liner was taken to quaran
tine to be fumigated until every rat
succumbs and each alien mosquito
chokes to death,
Â«- It was neither rats nor mosquitoes
that bothered the liner's passengers,
however. Both on the outward and
homeward voyage of the City of Para
a thief or thieves have been busy
separating passengers from valuable
odds and ends, the stuff taken varying
from socks to simoleons.
Ernest Forbes and Captain Stewart
Erice were the star victims on the
homeward voyage. They joined the
City of Para at Corinto, and between
there and this port, but at different
times, their staterooms were entered
and valuables pilfered therefrom. From
Brice's room $260 was stolen. The thief
also heipt-d himself to a few pairs of
Brice'B best open-work socks and took
his scold watch and chain. Forbes'
room was visited later. The thief or
thieves took J"is in cash, and from Mrs.
Forbes trunk an assortment of valuable
liiigerie was selected.
The thefts were promptly reported
t<Â» Captain Brown, but although the
ship was searched no trace of the loot
wmm discovered and the thief is still
unknown. Captain Brown informed
TJrice and Forbes that some of the pas
sengers on the downward trip had been
robbed in similar manner, and. In the
iibsv-nce of Sherlock Holmes, the only
deduction he could make was that the
thief or thieves had made the round
trip on the liner.
\u25a0 The passengers were not the sole
sufferers by the lack of discipline. Af
ter leaving Panama the ship's cargo
was broached and ten members of the
crew, held responsible for this serious
offense, were turned over to the Mex
ican authorities at Acapulco.
The "City of Para brought a small
cargo - and forty-three passengers,
i raong whom were:
Mabel Whitney Sayles. Ben Cunningham,
"it omits JoSin Pan. Mary Parr, Charles Graves,
Luisa. . Graves, Ernest Forbes, Marie Korbet,

from " the north, where he. Â£ has

with a , party of gold seekers, bound
for; the Copper: River : country, j which
was then just beginning to attract at
tention from the outside world. .Thirty
days later the little -expedition reached
the coast- off the mouth' of the Copper,'
where it wintered.: -and in the early
part of the . following year started up
the river on a trip that proved most
disastrous. Out of a band of fifty hope

RINDER MUST
PROVE PAPERS
U. S. 'Secret Service Agent
Helms Investigates His
Citizenship Documents
TALK ABOUT QUASHESG
Second Officer of Steamer
Manchuria Permitted to
Cast His Lot With Saunders
United .^.States Secret Service Agent
John H. Helms Is investigating, the man
ner in which Captain John H. " Kinder of
the steamship .Minnesota obtained his
citizenship papers, " and although Agent
Helms' is i very secretive . as to' the result
of his examination he appears : to be ab
normally anxious to Hear â¢ the' precise
time of the arrival of the Minnesota at
Seattle.
I A rumor has been prevalent j for about
a week; to the effect that the more or
less ; gallant captain had .marooned him
self at Shanghai, China, because he was
fearful of arrest . on his arrival in the
United States on a charge -of; being con
cerned in the naturalization frauds:
KINOER*S FRIENDS CONFIDENT.
The Call has received the following dis
patch from its correspondent at Seattle
with Preference to the rumor of Captain
Rinder's disappearance: \u25a0'. . v
If Captain John Kinder has left the steam
ship Minnesota in the Orient' he has failed to
notify the 'officers of the \u25a0' Great Northern
Steamship Company, and Is running away from
a bugaboo. The Great Northern has the as
surance of the District. Attorney's' office here
that" If proceedings were i brought against- Kin
der thÂ«y ; would have to be quashed. Similar
assurances were given the company by Us own
local attorney, and two days - ago a lengthy
opinion was received from Eastern counsel
to the teame effect. This last advice was given
after consultation with Washington, D. C,
officials. Kinder is not in danger of success
ful prosecution.
Before the Great Northern allowed Kinder to
take out the Minnesota: on her last trip a spe
cial representative of the company was sent
to California to make a thorough investigation.
He was there three weeks and 1 reported on
the facts. Officers of ths company were satis
fled that Kinder' s papers were good, and he
was sent out in. the Minnesota again.
Rinder signed for the, voyage "ami to leave
the ship in "Oriental: waters would be to break
bis contract. The Minnesota is now at Shang
hai on her return trip. :\u25a0\u25a0;.\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0-..
AGENT HELMS PESSIMISTIC.
. Agent Helms when shown the forego
ing dispatch remarked:
."If Captain Rinder should be prose
cuted here or. in Seattle the proceedings
won't be quashed if the Government, has
anything to say in the matter. AJI.I have
to say is that if the captain's papers are
shown to have / been fraudulently, ob
tained they .will be canceled, and should
we decide to prosecute him there will be
no 'quashing.' His papers are now being
Investigated, that is all that I' am
at liberty to state at present."
The Manchuria will sail to-day with
her captain and her first and second of
ficers, all of alien birth, under a cloud.
The papers of Captain James William
Saunders and of Chief Officer | Henry
Morton of' that .vessel^ have been found to
be* null* and void; they having ; been .ob
tained by means of fraud and perjury on
the' part' of '-. the witnesses who appeared
for these gentlemen. 'i The papers of ; Sec
ond Officer Lundln of the samo
vessel have been placed in the same cate
gory for a similar reason. Lundin and
his; attorney appeared yesterday before
United States D'strlct Attorney Robert
T. Devlin -and Agent Helms and told the
story of his/ naturalization. .^ It appeared
that at" the time he was; made a -citizen
he had . been long enough ; a resident of
the country to satisfy the requirements
of the law,, but that one of his witnesses,
who had known him for only, two years,
swore that he had'known him" to have
been a resident, of .the, United States for
five years. This was decided to "be per
jury, and the informal opinion was given
thaf Mate Lundln's papers were invalid.
It was resolved, however; to allow Mr.
Lundin to retain his papers during this
trip of the Manchuria ' in order to avoid
embarrassing the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company. When the three officers return
their papers will be formally taken up
and the question as to whether they will
be permitted to- be naturalized anew will
by that time have been decided by the
United States" Attorney General at Wash
ington, D. C
HINDER IN GOOD LIGHT.
Steamship Men Say Charg-en Grow Out
oln Quarrel.'
SEATTLE, Sept. 26.â The questioning
of the naturalization papers of Captain
John â¢ H. ; Rinder, ' commander' of the
Minnesota, is given but here as the re
sult of a fight being made upon him
by the Masters' -and l Pilots' Association,
with whom he/ has* been at ">, logger

SAYS ALBERSES
ARE TO BLAME
Passengers on Liner City
of Para Tell of Ameri
cans in Jail; at -Nicaragua
CONSUL IS RESPONSIBLE
United States Representa
tive at Managua Credited
With Stirring Up Fuss
Among the passengers on the liner
City :* of Para, which arrived here yes
terday ; from Panama and way ports,
was Stewart Brice. a son of the late
United States Senator Calvin S. Brice
of Ohio. With Brice was Ernest
Forbes. .Brice is general, manager of
the Nicaragua Finance and Improve
ment Company, a. concern in which,
prominent local capitalists are inter
ested and which enjoys valuable con
cessions from the Nicaraguan Govern
ment. Forbes is connected with the
same concern. - v.
Nicaragua has been much in the pub
lic eye of late on account of the Alber3
case. .The Alberses are two Americans
who \u25a0 were lately thrown into jail in
the southern republic and on whose be
half: quite" a fuss was made in the~
State Department.
According to Brice and Forbes, the
Alberses are in the wrong- and Justly
deserve to be behind the bars.
This Government at first intended to
make a naval demonstration on behalf
of the Alberses, but later contented it
self with sending United States Minis
ter-Merry to Ocotal to see that they
got a fair trial, i ;
ZELAYA VERY FRIENDLY.',-".
\u25a0 According to Brice and Forbes, Presi
denÂ£*Zelaya.is very friendly to Ameri
cans. The Alberses tried. to break into
a certain concession already granted
by Zelaya -to others. They were
warned. They replied that they 'were
Americans and proposed to do as they
"darned please? 1 andHhey did.
They hoisted the American flag over
their house, armed tneir servants and
defied the authority of Zelaya. Officers
were . sent to demand an explanation
a,nd were met with a show of loaded
rifles. No shots <were fired, but in
sulting messages to Zelaya were. sent
by the President's representatives.
And then Zelaya did as he pleased.
He sent soldiers, and the soldiers
gathered in the Alberses and put them
In a nice warm Jail, where they are
still awaiting trial.
Under ordinary circumstances, says
Brice, the United States Government
would not have been troubled in the
matter. HebUimes the misplaced am
bition of Chester Donaldson, United
States Consul at Managua, for all the
fuss.
CONSUL IN BAD ODOR.
Donaldson, he says, is in bad odor
with decent people in Nicaragua. Don
aldson^ says Brice, and Forbes confirms
him, made open boast that the Albers
case . offered him tne opportunity to
elevate himself from \u25a0 a. consuls to a
minister;, that he would have warships
off the Nicaraguan coast and' would
effect a spectacular release of two Ill
used American citizens. â¢ With the
prominence -this would give him and
his, friendship with. Secretary of State
Elihu Root, with "whom he went to col
lege, it would be easy to take a big
step up in the diplomatic service. He
had even picked out his post. Minister
to Venezuela: was the job he wanted.
"In an interview 'with President Ze
laya just before they left Nicaragua,
the; chief executive of the southern're
public expresse-1 himself freely^ to
Brice and Forbes . on . the. .subject of
Donaldson, whose action he denounced
as/an ungrateful "return for many fa
vors, many of them financial and sub
stantial. Zelaya told them he Jiad
more than once lent money to Donald
son \u25a0 and that the handsome house in
which the American Consul resides is
only one "evidence of Zelaya's past
generosity.

Nevr York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. 26. â There wajj very lit
tle speculative activity In the stock market to.
day. owing to the restraint of the money situ
ation. The trading was lethargic at times and
the price movement was Ineignlflcant. Appar
ently money lenders refrained from the active
calling- of loans, such as induced the liquida
tion of yesterday, and holders of stocks were
relieved from the necessity of marketing their
holdings. But in cplte of the . freedom from
pressure. there was little -disposition to under
take new/ ventures in the face of the market.
While no -recall .credits, occurred, . It waa the
common understanding that banking authoritie*
were in a mood of disapproval In placing funds
In stock market operations. Seme operators in
jstorfcs bad been -Induced to -decrease, their lines.
It is estimated that the dividends In October
will call for $72,000,000. These requirements
would follow clotitly upon any release of funds
by the week's syndicate- transactions, with the
linal installment on- the Japanese ioan in the
background of next- month. - â¢ .'.""\u25a0'
Meantime the interior demand for funds was
reported to have set In airaln with increased
force, and the e&xne is true of the Sub-Treas
ury drain on the bank reserves. , .
To-day's Sub-Treasury statement shows' a
withdrawal from the banks since the last bank
statement of $3,017,000, compared with a gain
by banks for the same period last week of
$499,000. Foreign exchange here was strong
to-day and moved i away from the gold Import
point, while discounts hardened in London and
BerJln. The private rate of discount in the
London market Is again above the bank rate,
thus indicating the expectation that the bank
will advance He .rate on Thursday. But the
same condition ruled last week at this time
when the decision of thu Dank authority fol
lowed to-day the existing rate. To-day's
statement of the Imperial Bank of Germany
showed a decrease of $2,735,0C0 In the cash on
hand. The news of the day was not Impor
tant. The rise in Amalgamated Copper was
accounted for by an advance in the price of the
metal and the increase In the Anaconda dividend.
Thare was a special movement In traction
stocks, led by Brooklyn Transit, which was
shared by Chicago Union Traction.' Chicago
Subway on the curb dropped an extreme $y 2 ,
following a 9-point break yesterday. Reports
of large purchases of .iron abroad for American
Interests was taken to account for the firmness
in the iron and eteer stocks. The favorable
weekly crop bulletin did not attract much at
tention, as the facts It contained were gener
ally well known. In connection with the pay
ment of the final Installment of $50,000,000 on
Saturday on subscription!) to the Pennsylvania
convertible bond, it is important to consider
that $50,000,000 of the 4 14 per cent collateral
betterment notes of the Pennsylvania guaran
teed by the Pennsylvania Railroad fall due on
October 1. or, that date being Sunday, on Oc
tober 2, next Monday.. Those two operations
will have on offsetting effect in the money
market that can hardly be expected to obviate
entirely the necessity for considerable shifting
of loans. . \u25a0\u25a0â¢ > : \u25a0 . '

New York Cotton Market. ;
NEW YORK, Sept. 26.â COTTONâ ThÂ« mar
ket was irregular and unsettled; to-day with
trading lighter in volume than recently . and
more of a professional character, with the bulk
of business j confined' to the -in-and-out'- opera
tions .of various cliques in the contest with
the traders, which are showing 1 a tendency to
resist lurther efforts to force the market up.'
There - was no . important news developing on
the general crop situation, or In the trade con.
dltlons here or at Liverpool. The weekly Gov
ernment report' and. weather bulletin announced
at noon contained nothing new. It' was of its
usual character and continues to endeavor to
favor both sides. The result Is that Is In
formation - is now regarded as 'so misleading
by both sides that its reports are receiving lit
tie attention. 'They will probably, however,
be continued until after ' the end of next
month. . ... \u25a0 ... >
\u0084 Crop ' news continues very bullish jln the
main, but the most important outside. operator
issued a pamphlet -covering over sixteen pages
of closely 1 printed sheets of crop \u25a0 news, < and
â¢dispatches. Issued during the month -of Sep
tember, last year, and calling- attention to the
fact that the situation then was as
precluding; the possibility of a crop of- eleven
to eleven and one-half million bales. 'On tha
other ' band, there was additional I information
sent out by the .bull brokers on ;-. the sub
ject ' of the j progress of a proposition .to ac
cumulate a million bales and hold it off the

President George A. Moore of the
Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Com^
pany. "who returned yesterday from the
East, last "evening denied positively
that there was any truth in stories that
have been^ circulated In this city dur
ing* the lest .few <Jays relative to al
leged -"Significance of the deal .-which
resulted in transferring the industrial
Insurance policies and industrial insur
ance, department of " the Pacific Mutual
Life Insurance Company to the Metro
politan Life Insurance Company. . \u25ba . \u25a0-
It^has been alleged, in public prints,
that- the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance
Company sold to the Metropolitan con
cern a monopoly- In Industrial insur
ance in this State. This Is denied by
President Moore emphatically.
"We could not sell a monopoly- of
that sort." said Mr. Moore, "and a mo
ment of reflection would show that
there can be no bargain that could ln
eure a monopoly in industrial or any
other form of insurance. The insur
ance, field is open to every company
tnatTwlsbes to enter It. There are
quite a large number of corporations
besides the Metropolitan that are doing
an industrial Insurance business in the
United States. The field is just as free
for them to enter into business as it
ever iias been for any one."
\u25a0OXL'Y PRICE KEPT SECRET.
President Moore also expressed dis
belief, with emphasis, that there was
any probability that he would be called
to New York as a witness to testify
about the sale of Industrial policies
and industrial business of the Pacific
Mutual Life Insurance Company.
"There is only one leading fact in
that transaction," he said, "which Is
that the Metropolitan came along and
offered us a price that made it advan
tageous from a business point of view
to cell, and we sold accordingly. There
was nothing concealed about the trans
action. The local newspapers had full
accounts of the sale and purchase. and
the Metropolitan company, advertised
the acquisition of our industrial busi
ness." Everything was made known
with 'the exception ot the price that
was paid for the business. I would
not feel at liberty to tell what the
price was, alt-hough the Metropolitan
company can mention the price if its
officers so. desire. All that I could
testify to that Ib not already known,
if I was called to New York as a wit
ness, would be regarding the price paid
by the Metropolitan to us."
XOT A MUTUAL COMPAXY.
President Moore having made the
preceding statements, said also that the
Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company
has no connection with the Eastern
life insurance companies in any way,
and is therefore not a party in interest
in the insurance investigations that
are In progress in New York. He also
said that the Metropolitan is - not a
mutual company. Its policy holderp
are not Its shareholders and the only
liability that the Metropolitan has .to
\u25a0its policy holders Is on account of its

MONEY WAKES
SOCIAL SCALE
Max Davis GiTes His Opin
ion of Conditions That
Lead to Exclusive Circles
TESTIFIES IN ' LAWSUIT
Effort of Capitalist to Evade
Payment for Baby Clothes
Proves Very Interesting
Testimony given, before Judge Mu
rasky yesterday, outlining at least one
business man's opinion of the things
that qualify families in San Francisco
to demand social recognition, will
doubtless prove somewhat of a shock
to the blue-blooded aristocracy of the
metropolis. This testimony gives no ;
weight to claims of royal lineage, cul
ture or refinement and builds the so
cial scale alone on dollars, or golden ;
eagles if you will.
This interesting bit .of testimony
came out during the hearing of the
suit instituted years ago by W.S. Mor
row, as assignee of Davis, Schonwasser
& Co., against Callaghan Byrne, club
man and capitalist, to collect a bill
of $355 30 for baby clothes, in which
to robe the first born of the defendant.
Before this youngster came into the
world, Byrne and his former wife, now
Mrs. S. C. Brngham, quarreled. Mrs.
Byrne went to the home of her mother
to await the arrival of the stork, but
took several trips to Davis, Schonwas
ser & Co.* s, where she purchased the
baby clothes and charged them to
Byrne.
Shortly after the little one was born
Mrs. Byrne secured a divorce from her
husband. He then placed his proper
ties in this State, including the Byrne
block In Los Angeles,- under the man
agement of his brother, J. W. Byrne,
president of the Pacific-Union Club,
and went to Europe. Upon his return
Morrow brought suit against him in
the Justice Court. Judge Golden, how
ever, decided in favor of Byrne, the
complications of the divorce and re
marriage of Mrs.' Byrne weighing in
favor of the defendant. An appeal was
taken to the Superior Court and this
appeal Is now being heard by Judge
Murasky.
' Mrs. Blngham's deposition was first
read yesterday and then Max Davis, of
the firm of Davis, Schonwasser & Co.,
was called on the stand. He was asked
how it was that he granted such large
credit to the then Mrs. Byrne.
"Well," he said,' "I knew that their
social standing was* high and such
being the case I had no hesitancy in
granting the credit."
"Ho'fr do you know their social
standing was high?" was asked.
"Well," he replied, "I looked up their
financial standing and as Mr. Byrne
was given a high rating I knew that
they must stand high socially."
"That was all you knew of their
social standing?"
"Well, I knew Mrs. Byrne before her
marriage and she moved In excellent
circles. She was Miss Hope Ellis,
daughter of General Ellis. After", her
marriage "I knew : that she must | con
tinue to move in such circles, as Mr.
Byrne was a wealthy man."
"That is all," said counsel for the
plaintiff. "We now know how-to de
termine a man's social standing; we
will measure it by his financial."
Judge Murasky has taken the suit
under advisement.
policies. The average cost of indus
trial Insurance by ; the Metropolitan
company is less than 15 cents to' each
Insured person a week.. The Metropoli
tan is' what is "known as a proprietory
company in which 'the money neces
sary to carry on the business was put
up by the of its stock, who are
not the policy holders.
One reason for President Moore's be
lief that he will not be called to New
York as a witness in connection with
the sale of the Pacific Mutual's indus
trial business to the Metropolitan, is
ihat he has only just returned . from
New York; that it was known to in
surance men that he was there, and
It was probable that if he was required
asa witness he would have been noti
fied when he was in easy distance: and
could testify with the least incon
venience and loss of time.

Collapses in Court -When Wifehood Is
*/'/ Revealed in Presence of [Jilted.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
J. Arnold Milton,- a tall and muscular
negro, â¢ opined that Justice ; would be
grossly outraged if he were pronounced
guilty of battery and peace disturb
ance, or either, of those offenses. He
had epistolary .evidence to show that
his visit to Miss Hazel Stewartâ or the
lady who bore that cognomen ere -she
deceived him by accompanying another
to the ,altarâ was perfectly Justified;
per contra, -that, the ; attack made upon
him by the young 'woman's self-con
stituted guardians was absolutely
without warrant. Instead of being the
bat'terer, he was the battered, as the
deep dent in his head would, prove, and
the peace was not disturbed by him,
but by those who assailed- him; -\u0084-.
Then the story was Incoherently un
folded to Police Judge. Conlan. * \u25a0 : , â¢
Mr. Milton, who is a professional
musician, believed he had monopolized
the affection of Miss Stewart, a seven
teen-year-old octoroon, with sylph-like
figure and face of rare comeliness. He
wooed her at San Jose, where ; she
dwelt with .her parents, and' when he
came to the metropolis to; fill a pro
fessional ..'engagement -'-'She 'tearfully
bade him adieu; and -.afterward: sent 4. to
him several letters. which ; fairly, reeked
of pledges of faithfulnesB'and implora
tions: that he, ever, remain -.true ito her.
Those letters\he had; preserved." Sub
sequently she came to the city,; and
clung to him as if she were his shadow
until a society, for the of
wayward maidens; took her away and
placed i her .in custody of * Mrs. Leona
Jones, who keeps a home, for .colored
girls at 262 Jessie; street. Mr; Milton
ascertained her 'whereabouts. V /, â¢ '
'Twas last Monday afternoon thaf no
tification came to .Mrs." Jones 'of a tele
phone , call . for :, Miss , Stewart . , having
been received at a- nearby corner, gro
cery, and Mrs. â¢ ,Jon6sU; escorted the
young, woman to ; UjÂ«;; store.; Just, as
Mrs, . Jones, had'; Suspected, there sat
J., Arnold . Milton, "idly*"- strumming | a
mandolin and keeping, feverish eye: on
the door. No sooner did the two ladies
enter than he .leaped - ; to" hisj feet/
grasped Miss 'Stewart's 2 hand, earnestly
called" her his "own honeybug" and:re
quested her to fly with Â£ him; Ere she
could reply her other hand was grasped
by Mrs. Jones,' and between that .lady
and Mr. Milton ; she 'was \ hauled an 4
jerked until her Wms were almost; dis
located. Mrs. Jones 'won . the : tug-of
war and triumphantly bore her charge
homeward, [â¢ but : Mr. : Milton \u25a0 followed,
scolding Mrs. Jones/ until;; that lady's
husband suddenly appeared oh the
scene ; and abruptly struck' Mr." Milton's
head with a~blunt r Instrument of .some

the c estate ; under : both will ! and ; codicil,
arid to his niece, Mary G. Stone, and " en
tries in his diary up to within a few
weeks of his death. .: \
/Many; of the letters submitted throw
an interesting; light on- the social life of
the .-.shrewd J old man, .whose millions ; are
now: the; cause of , litigation. â¢ Out of all
the references to business and land deals
conic â¢: many sentences ; showing Davis'
care [ tor his sister, and solicitude for her
welfare. ; ; The "generous forwarding of a
large -remittance with ' each communica

! : The specimens of : handwriting that oc
casion a separate discussion' by. the attor
neys presenting them will be of the ut
most importance in establishing the gen
uineness of .the codicil. '
In a letter â¢to his - sister, Jane, written
at' San- Francisco- on: May 17, 1902, Davis
describes his -journey "to California. He
says: "I left Galway for New York on
the ! 4th of April .of 1853, and left New
York \on the , steamer * Uncle Sam for As
pinwall on April 5. ' It ' , took eight days to
make the 'trip. . We walked mostlof the
way* acros the isthmus to Panama, left
Panama on the 17th or 18th of April and
arrived In San Francisco on the sth of
May, 1853." -.;/;" r . . : )- \:: r .Jj
~ff In ;: a ; letter \ addressed to "My dear
nlece,~MaryG. Stone," who. is the prin
cipal .contestant, Davis showed his love
for his sister by/ writing the following:^
'rt"l J want * you ' to take - charge 'of Sister
Jane . at ; once and keep' her under" your
charge and care as -long as she lives, in
case that you survive her. Administer to
her. every want. VKeep a nurse to wait on
her in case: you" think it advisable. I
will pay, all expenses Incurred : by you In
complying ; with my wishes." \u25a0
-Several, other letters, are addressed, to
Mrs. Stone relating to money, matters
and the care of Jane Davis in New York
State. Every , one : Is . accompanied by
money, for expenses of caring for his â¢ sis
ter.; One \u25a0 urges Mrs. . Stone ; to protect her
from pastors j and missionaries; "who by
use of flattery might easily persuade her
to give away 'considerable sums."
â¢ A diary submitted in. evidence showing
entries made by Davis a few .weeks" be
fore his death shows but slight signs of
feebleness: or erratic tendencies in the
writing. . "i:~
