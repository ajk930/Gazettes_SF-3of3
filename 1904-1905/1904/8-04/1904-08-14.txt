ha was dyjng, perhaps dead. She could
seo the Myjpr stanching a wound "with
a, handkerchief that fluttered in the
breeze. Fascinated, although her heart
beat v.lldly, and her fear remained un
abated, she did not move from the win
dow. It_w.as her ardent hope that Doc
tor Xavier might be in the house; and
when she heard his voice, a great
weight seemed to be lifted from her
mind. What cc-uld have happened, she
asked. She judged that it must be
something terrible.
Many minutes passed in this intoler
able taispense. . She perceived figures
moving/ to and fro. between the trees
and anxious messengers" running from
the house to the garden and back
again. No one appear: d to accuse
another or to defend himself. But once
did ZSsther identify Doctor Xavier; and
this v.as at the moment when the Moor
lifted a candle and the whole picture
stood out like - vignette in the dark
ness.. In -that instant the scene was
fully revealed. A' man lay upon the
gritss and four stood about him. Es
ther observed that he was in evening
dress; and that they had torn his shirt
open to stanch a; wound, in his side.
The Doctor himself held a cflass in his
hand, and put it from time to. time to
the prone man's lips. At a little dia
tan'- apart the moon's' beams dis
covered another actor in this grim
drama. He appeared to be a foreigner,
and a loose Spanish cloak, covered him
to the knees. In Â¦ defiant attitude he
leaned against one of the silver birches,
as though entirely unconcerned at that
which was' passing so near to him.
Anon, he approached the kneeling
figures, and I Esther heard him' asking
questions.^ This man, I she imagined,
had struck the . blow. J The " dreadful
mystery of it ail: appalled; her. What
was- this -house- in which _ such things
were done? Why, had she entered It?
Esther was too much interested to
answer him, and -she followed timidly
at his side while he crossed the lawn
and lighted a silver lamp in her bou
doir. Here everything was as 8he had
left it but a few hours ago. Her own
sketches lay "untouched upon the table;
the books she had been reading were
still open. The fountain splashed al
most with a weird sound in the silence
of the .night- One fact, however, per
mitted Esther to. form an instant con
clusion as to the -events, which had so
greatly, agitated her. The door between
her own room" and â¢ the Doctor's study
was no- longer locked as it had been
during his absence. Evidently some
one had entered her boudoir and had
forgotten to close the door upon leav
ing. It now stood so much open that
She knew, then, that she had not es
caped detection; and, greatly hoping
that he would be able to calm her
shattered nerves and to offer her some
reassuring t-xplanation, Esther dressed
herself quickly and went down into the
hal!. It^was with no little hesitation
that she stood upon the threshold of a
scene of which every detail still haunt
ed her. She feared v that she would,
never have the courage to approach
that place of death or even to look upon
it collectedly. When, at length, she
summoned her courage to her and
opened the long window giving upon
the lawn, she discovered that the Doc
tor was alone and that the others had
vanished. Not a trace remained of
deed or actors. Doctor Xavier himself
Bmoked . a cigar with apparent non
chalance.
"Come," he said, approaching her di
rectly, "I wish 'to talk to.you. It shall
be in your own room. Esther. The
night-air- Is, not good for us. You
should. have put a shawl about your
head." . -v./Y, '",
"It is I, Esther. Please dress and
come down to me. I see you cannot
sleepâ it is imprudent to stand at the
window after rain."
est's heart. Esther would have slept
again, and was â¢ dozing orf, when she
heard a murmur of distant voices like
tho.se of monks chanting an ofiice.
Anon, a , wild haunting melody arose,
litful and weird; and to this there suc
ceeded a harsh guttural into-nution,
which again gave place to the sweeter
music. Esther, believing ihat Doctor
Xavier was stlllaway, and that none
but the servants remained in the house,
started up when first sha heard the
singing, and sat. amazsd, in her bed
until the last wild chord had-tloated
away upon the still night air. An::lous
to learn who. the singers were, she. put
on her dressing gown, and, going tli her
bedroom window, the opened it very
quietly and peered thence into the gar
den. Fc-r many minutes neither sight
nor sound rewarded her. The bricked
up windows tn'f the Doctor's study for
bade her to ascertain whether he occu
pied it or no. Her own little room,
near to it, had the windows shut and
the blinds drawn. Esther could not de
tect a light anywhere in the house. She
could hear no voices. She would have
returned to her bed, baffled by the
mystery, but for. u sudden cry which
arose upon the far side of the quail
l angle, and was answered hy a low
guttural exclamation, and then by thÂ«
heavy, thud of a falling body. Esther
did not at once understand the mean
ing c-f this, nor could she account for
the presence of strangers in thy gar
den. She imagined that the servants
would be awakened presently and the
alarm be raised; but when no one ap
peared and no voice was raised, her
growing dread of some veiled mystery
became a fear surpassing .words. She
did not dare to move from the window;
she feared that some one would detect
her there and resent her presence.
Anon, she thought that she observed
figures moving among the trees,' and
then, as the greater surprise, she be
held Yusstif, the Moor, carrying a can
dle, which' his long bony hand sheltered
from the wind. Her curiosity now.was
raised to the highest pitch. She re
marked that the Moor crossed the
quadrangle to that corner of the gar
den whence the cry. had come. Another,
and :he a' stranger, followed at Yus
suf's heels and carried a second silver
candlestick ; \ and, together, the men
stooped at | last , as though jj over some
object which lay hidden by the trees.
Tn this supreme moment, Esther fj first
learned the truth. A man had been
Esther listened patiently, for he
seemed to be offering her an apology
for the distress she had suffered. Ob
serving that she was expected to an- ?
swer him, ehe took refuge in a sen"
eral confession rather than Â¦ a specific
assent.
"I heard some one slnsinj la the
"You were at the window." he be
gan, directly she was seated, "and you
are aware of the unfortunate accident
which has happened in thl3 house to
night. I can quite admit. Miss Venn,
that any young girl might be alarmed.
It is never good for a woman to be
the witness .of men's differences. In
the case of my own nation, our quar
rels, unfortunately, do not. like yours
in thi3 country, begin and end with
words. Let me say at once that two
of my friends quarreled In this house
to-night and that one of them, un
happily, has some occasion to repent
his hastiness. I do not think that his
v.ound 13 serious; but I am exceed
ingly sorry that he should have re
ceived it under my roof. A philoso
pher, no doubt, would remember the
old apothegm about a gambler's folly
and its consequences. I say nothing,
because I regard life as a gamble from
the cradle to the grave. If we do
not play with cards, we find more
dangerous tools â men, T7omen, nations,
powera and principalities, our own am
bitions, the follies of our frienda. Cards
are 'responsible for many pitiful mis
fortunes; but they are not often of
the graver kind. I hope they will not
prove to be so to-night. Lorenzo, my
cousin, is more frightened than hurt.
I regret the misfortune chiefly for
your sake: but you will be wise to
remember that such a thing is not
likely to happen here again!"
Esther obeyed him, as she always
did, and sat down, not a little awed,
waiting fc-r him to speak. No words
of hers, sha thought, were called for,
nor would they help him.
"Now." he said, motioning her to the
sofa, "if you will 'permit me tor finish
my cigar. I should like to have a chat.
Miss Venn."
Esther perceived the soft green carpet
and the polished tables of the great
room beyond. Cards littered the floor;
decanters of wine were plainly visible
in the soft mellow light which flowed
down from unseen lampa. Doctor
Xavier's first act was to close this door
and then to draw the heavy brocade
curtains across the window of her bou
doir.
In despair of any answer she turned
away at I:\st' and lay shivering; upon
her bed. The reaction was intense.
She was punished, she thought, for her
vain ambitions. She determined, if it
were possible.. to quit the hoxise to-mor
row. .And then, .she heard, her own
name. The Doctor called her from the.
lawn beneath her window. She r.ns
wered him at once, for shewas glad to
hear his voice.
"What Is itâ who Is there?"
Another page speke of Esther's com
fort and of her natural surprise at the
absence of her hostess. Julia appeared
to bs very Â£inxic;:c to Get her at her
ea.EC. "You realiy must not be dull
r.bile we are av.ay," she said. "The
house is Liberty Hall, and you are to
regard it as sour own. I have told the
coachman that you will require the
horses; and when Francis returns I am
sure he will take you to the theater. I
shall try to be in London by the end of
July and then we will all go to the
lakes together. Oh, these northern
winds, how they make me shiver! It
will be different in Switzerland, chere
amie. I thall have ho much to show
you th^re, and it will br nothing but
sunshine and flowers. So a bientot, ma
petiteâ with much love from your
friend and sister. Julia de Llontalvan."
Esther read the letter with eager In
tâ¬iCJ t, : and particularly the signature,
which was- new to^ her. She had un
derstood the Doctor's name to be. sim
ply Xiivierâ which, indeed, was but one
of his Christian names commonly em
ployed by him when traveling. But
now she remembered that he was a
Spaniard by birth and probably the de
scendant of some old Spanish family of
note. In this respect Julia's letter was
not unsatisfactory. There was so much
to do, so many . surprises awaited her
dally In that house of wonders, that
she gTasped at any ctraw of argument
which would permit her.to remain there
â¢with confidence. .Each -day, in the
earlv morning, she went to the bath as

Â¦ but was. there any word from
him. Sncfa news as Esther
received she found upon the morn
ing of the seoor.d day in a closely
v. ritten letter from the loquacious
JuJia. It was a rambling epistle, writ
ten In the characterisiicafly pointed
hand of the foreigner, and Esther
blessed the education which had led
her in Exeter city to master the amaz
ing calijrraphy of Deans and Chapters.
She read the letter twice, and even
then was s^iircely enlightened. Julia
tpoke of grave events, which, for the
moment, had compelled her to leave
London. Her brother, she said, was
greatly occupied by the affairs of his
awn country. Bbe had hoped that he
had done with them forever; but new
circumstances had arisen, and they
cla'.m&d his attention. For herself she
was at Dinard. playing a little, bathing
a little, flirting a little.
""Bear with me patiently, my dear
Esther," she went on, "when I tell you
that 1 have actually had an offer of
marriage. He is fifty-two and not
ashamed of his age. lie calls himself
the Coir.te de Magnac-Lavat, and he is
quite bald. It was pathstic to refuse

such charge should be made. Day by
day now her interest in this momen
tous undertaking increased. Was it
possible, was it right, she would ask
herself, that a woman should desire
such success or labor .for it. And
against this t^he would pit the Doctor's
argument- and remember that every
thing which contributed to the happi
ness of humanity contributed also to
its beauty. The laws of health, upon
which later day civilization insisted,
the unceasing 1 battle with disease and
death, what were they but instruments
to- make mankind more beautiful?
Sometimes she would steal to the mir
ror and look" at herself furtively as
though afraid of her own temerity. The
face that she beheld there won some
new gift of health and prettiness every
day. Color, she said, had returned to
her cheeks. Her .eyes were wonderfully
bright. She had a clearness of skin
which was in itself a dc-wer of great
price. Often when the vision of the
gla,*s was accidental she would start
back- from it as from a revelation of
beauty which almost bewitched her.
Was this the Esther she had known?
By. what miracle had such a change
come about? Esther could not believe
that it was wholly so. The gowns with
which the Docto-r's liberality had sup
plied her were, indeed, the master
pieces of a French costumier's art.
From time to time in the privacy of
her bedchamber she would put on some
perfect melange of silk and chiffon,
and, amazed and fearful, would ask
herself if any of those who had once
known her would say that this was the
old Esther. Nevertheless, the question
"why" was asked vainly. Why, had
she 'been chosen? For what purpose*
Ah, if she could but have answered
that! . ;?V-:- .
We have said that fifteen days
passed and found Doctor, Xavier still
absent. It was upon the" fifteenth night
that Esther heard of his return,; and
heard of it in a way that at once star
tled and perplexed her. It had been a
wet afternoon, with a heavy thunder
storm about sis o'clock. The. close air
and great heat resulted in such a ner
vous headache as the old time used to
give her, and Esther went to bed at an
early hour, and for a little while slept
restfully. When she .awoke, she
thought It would-be ~the middle of the
night, for the moon shone full and
golden, and the beams revealed the arf
bor of the garden like a den at a for-
Billy would have answered, perhaps,
but catching sight of the Moor, who
was crossing the lawn, he darted away
suddenly and left Esther's curiosity
ungratified. When she came : to think
of it she imagined that she had seen
the face of one of these girls at the
window on the day of her -arrival. It
did not alarm Esther so much when
she remembered that Doctor Xavier
had spoken of previous experiments
and of his failure.' She quite under
stood that disposition Â¦ and the will to
succeed must be given to experiments.

work by their own obstinacy, j- Esther

or of the doctor, but a telegram deliv

their absence. Julia telegraphed that
she had lost the train from DInard and
would not arrive until to-morrow
morning, and while the news was little
"comforting, Esther made the best of it.
She was even persuaded to dine in the
white and crimson room below; and
coming at length to perceive that she
was -at -no disadvantage at all even in
such a company, she made bold after
ward to take a seat in the corridor and
there to enjoy the music of the Hunga
rian band. No one would know her,
none ask her name, she thought; but in
this she was mistaken, for the < band
had hardly begun to play when some
one addressed her, and, turning, she
found herself face to face 1 with the
Prince of Cadi. . V^ e
He was in evening dress, with a light
black cape hanging loosely from his
shoulders. Esther imagined that he
had not dined at the hotel; but had re
turned to it from some other house.
The button of an order showed beneath
the lapel of his cape. His whitewalst
coat had no ornament of gold button or
watch chain. He was in the 1 ' -act of
drawing off his white kid gloves when
he addressed Esther, and in her sur
prise she looked up swiftly at him, and
could not conceal the pleasure "of her
recognition. Then, for the first time,
perhaps, she understood why his 'face
had seemed familiar to her even, upon
their first meeting. Once in an old his
tory book she had seen a picture of a
Spanish king, an engraving after one
of Velasquez's masterpieces, , and' : al

fore her might have been its subject :
CHAPTER X
We have shown under what circum
stances Esther quitted Paris, and how
that, in the company of Doctor Xavier
and his' sister, she paid her first visit
to the Chateau of St. Paul. With her
life In Spain, and afterwards in France
and Italy, this story concerns itself but
little. We know that she lived In close
seclusion for- nearly five months; we
hear of her in the mountains and the
cities; but her life is always unevent
ful, and it is r.ot until the month of
the following January that she ap
pears with dramatic suddenness upon
the social horizon of Faris, and Instant
ly is the foremost figure in that capital
of enthusiasms. Such a change in a
young girl's life can find few parallels
In the story of a woman, nor does the
account of it lose force by the most
modest estimates of the sensation
which attended her rentree. Unknown,
unsought, she had gone out. She re
turned to hear herself called the most
beautiful woman in France, to be the
spoiled child of the salon and the the
ater, to have the social world at her
feet. If she herself remained the at
tractive girt that Francisco Xavier
had found her, if she were unconscious
both of her influence and her beauty,
this happy circumstance owed not a
little to her own decided character and
the good common sense she had in
herited. Vanity at any time was re
pellant to her. None the less, she knew
that some miracle had influenced her
life â a miracle so simple and true that
faith could not be withheld.
She had come to Paris secretly, ac
companied by the loquacious Julia, and
unaware of the object of the unexpect
ed visit.- Five^ months of the solitudes
left her unprepared for this surprise.
She was never more surprised
than when, at Lausanne upon
that memorable day of Janu
ary, Doctor Xavier spoke once more of
the city and the world.
"The mountains can give us no
more," he had said. "We are like bees
who have sucked up the last drop of
honey. Come, we will return to Paris
without delay. It may be the last
Journey we- shall ever make as students
together."
Esther was perplexed at the enigma
of his words, but obedience was now a
habit to her. and she accompanied him
to the north without question. In Paris,
as we have told, she played for a brief
while her part in the social comedy of
which . the French . are such consum
mate* masters. Everywhere, at the
<^t6-morrow'*'he would wear roses in- his
hair.' Seriously, are : you a * friend of
his sister?"
Esther, blushed deeply at. the ques
tion. She knew that' she dare-nottell
this < stranger why she was in Dr.
Xavier's house.
â¢'â¢' "'No,', I can hot '. say [ that. ; : I think
Madame Julia. likes me; but ; it could
scarcely be friendship -yet. I am old
fashioned, you. 'know;.. I ; don't believe
that one can be friends in a day."
I * "I'll 'call you an acquaintance, then.
They tell me that she is expected here
to-morrow morning. Will you present
her with my regrets that I am called
away exactly an hour before she ar
rives." ,, -;

ing; but the Jest had a sting which
v he could not conceal. His own bravade
apparently struck him as an Impru

ever seen; even women raved about
her. As indifferent to the praises of

Esther carried her own secret and hid
It from the world as a precious thing.
Good sense forbade her to remember
the one romance of her life, and yet she
wished to remember It. That she would

lived In Paris now, and. naturally,
would meet her. He was not greatly
changed, she thought: certainly he had
lost nothing of that attractive person
ality which won her interest flvo
months ago. "* *."Â¦'
The night was a memorable one for
Esther In many ways. She had been in
troduced by Doctor Xavier to splendii
scenes abundantly since she arrived In
Paris; but thi3 scene at the house of
the Duque de Rlna surpassed them all.
Nominally a soiree musicalÂ© for the
nomadic aristocracy of the French
capital, to Esther it was chiefly a
vlsfon of immense rooms and brilliant
women, of soldiers and statesmen and
priests, but pre-eminently of a glitter
ing throng .which divided* as She en
tered upon Doctor Xavier's arm, and
watched her almost in silence as sh-i
swept up to the dais whereon the Duke
and Duchess received their guests. For
the first time then, perhaps, she knew
that the master-key of a woman'*
power had been entrusted to her. This
buzz of tongues, the envious eyes, could
not be mistaken. Everywhere In that
immense salon men were saying.
"Marvelous!" women were ex
claiming, "Who Is she?" Esther,
in her simplicity, did not dare to
ask if the triumph were wholly hers,
or in part that of curiosity
awakened by some tale of the mar
velous. She was dazed, it may bo
frightened, by the very applaus*- which
the master-mind had earned for her;
and when one by one the leaders of
Paris were introduced to her, she an
swered them, scarce knowing what she
said.
The Prince had been standing In the
door of the great conservatory which
gives off the Duchess' boudoir. HÂ«
wore a white uniform of a Spanish
legiment of hussars, and while his eyes
had followed Esther restlessly since
she entered the room, he made no
movement to recognize her until she
was alone. Then, without hesitation,
he crossed the room and held out his
hand.
"At last:" he said.
She looked up quickly and colored at
his ardent glance. The five months
which had elapsed since she saw him
had added something of dignity to his
manner nnd robbed him of a little of
his boyish imperiousness. But thÂ»
change was for the better. Esther
could admit that no salon of Paris ha-1
yet shown her a figure more distin
guished. Ho. in his turn, was unable
to take his eyes from her face. H-*
knew not what to think or say. Her
very beauty found him silent.
"You arc the good Samaritan." shÂ»
said, a little imploringly. "The Doctor
has left me, and the Pharisees pass by
on the other side."
He- recovered himaelr with an efftn 1 :
and offered his arm.
"Old Xavier, at least, is a generous
thief, " he said; "he leaves the treasure
behind him. Let us go into the con
servatory. Miss Venn; I will promis*
you wine if there is no oil."
He opened a passage for her through
the press of men and, discovering a
giant palm in a secluded corner and a
low couch behind it, he sat at once
and began to talk with that easy
familiarity which the years had made
a habit.
"You are greatly changed, Mis3
Venn: I hardly knew you. II
I did not wish to pay you a
compliment, I would ask you to be
angry. We do not recognize those who
become f.;mous; we want to be recog
nized by them. If old Xavier had not
taken himself off, I should have, been
afraid. He can spare me ten min
utes, I am sure."
Esther anrwered very naturally.
"Ten minutes! Oh, but that's a long
time! And he will be looking for me.
I should bo terrified if I missed him.
Prince. Imagine being lost -in Pari3
nnd advertised for in tha newspapers!
Dr. Xavier might not think I was
worth a reward, you know!"
He hastened to contradict her with
a Spaniard's graciousness.
"Old Xavier's riches would not be
rewrrd enough." he said. "The Bank
of France would be ruined. Miss Venn!
I have been three years trying to lose
Francisco Xavier, and I have not cu
ceeded. It is impossible to lose such
a man, I assure you. He has enjoyed
your society for five months â is it not
so? Then I shall- not ask his permis
sion for my ten minutes. Let us b*
serious and ask what you have been
doing. You were going to Spain when
I saw you last. You must tell me that
you like my country. It Is the ons
subject upon which I am a bigot."
Esther was able to tell him that,
and she did so very prettily.
"You have been very busy, Prince?"
she asked. He answered with a shruÂ«c
and took a cigarette from a little gold
case.
"Permit me," he said; "it Is a habit
of mine to smoke when any onÂ«
speaks of business. As for that, yes:
my weeks have been laborious. 1

neither. Admit the logic.""
"I don't admit it at all. Prince.
Others are better, surely, for our
work, and are we not all in some great
scheme of things, each with his own
part to play? You make fun of it, or
1 would argue with you. I can see
that you are not serious."
He blew a little cloud of smoke into
the still air â and seemed to muse for
a little while; then he said:
"Perhaps I am not. The day will
come which will find me awake. Let
me postpone it as long as possible
while I tell you that you would make
an excellent priest if you were not too
pretty. Believe me, Miss Esther, I
am dumb with surprise."
Esther read a deeper meaning in
his compliment and did not rssent it.
She thought that she understood this
man wholly as she had never under
stood a human -being In her life. When
she was with Francisco Xavier there
had often been a sense of the obscure
end the unrevealed and it perplexed

from an early age, he regarded men,

this. service he rewarded with a gener

was undeserved. He had many talent3,
but rarely chose to apply them patient
ly or with perseverance. One by one
he visited the cities of Europe, and
made his dwelling there until he
had exhausted the city's pleasures.
At the present time he was in
Paris until some new adventure
should engage him, and this sud
den unlooked-for encounter with
her whom he called "the pretty
English girl" at least amused him.
Simply saying, "Permit me," he drew
a chair to the table, anfi at once order
ed a waiter to bring them coffee. When
he had lighted a . cigarette, he asked
her of the doctor â

They had turned into the great boule
vard by, this time,' and all i the garish
life of Paris went crying, laughing, roll
ing before their eyes. Esther had read
'something of the city in the guide
books years ago ; . but \ the reality â¢ was
bo very â¢ differentâ from her ~ child
ish conceptions. She wondered if
there were one sad person in this Paris
of actuality. ' The shaded walks, the
noisy boulevard, cafes, shops, churches,

hundred questions; she cried out with
delight at every changing pageant. The
journey was, in truth, too short; and
when the cab stopped before the doors
of the" Rltz Hotel she was almost sorry
that it was over.
"Is It here, Suzanne, is this the ho
tel?" she asked.
"It is the Rltz, mademoiselle. You
have never seen anything like It. I
will go and find out which rooms you
are to have."
Suzanne discovered that their rooms
were upon the first floor, a little suite
overlooking the fountain and the
courtyard. The dainty taste of the old
French furniture captivated Esther;
the privacy consoled her; and when the
girl unpacked a taking gown of silk
and chiffon and had dressed her hair to
the best advantage, she could admit
that after all the ordeal below might
not be so terrible. So far. she was

"He leaned across the table so far
that Esther could almost feel his
breath upon her cheek. A true instinct
had told her from the first that" destiny
intended the Prince to play some part
in her own life. What part It might
be, she did not dare to think. She
knew only that she was attracted, by
hlnr as she had never been by any
other living being.* She felt that if he
commanded her, sh$ would obey: it
might even be would follow where he
willed. And he, in his turn, -schooled
to read women truly, was not Ignorant
of -his power. She was charming, he
thought, this little English girl; he
must know more of her.
"Will you permit me," he repeated.
"Will you permit me to come to the
chateau V.' Â¦ Â«
"How can I forbid It, Prince? I am
Doctor Xavier's guest, and, pf course,
he would be glad to see you.
He laughed ironically at her sim
plicity.
"Glad â when he is crossing Europe
to avoid me! Oh, no; your friend, the
Doctor, does not tell you the truth.
Miss Venn, if he says that he Is glad
to see Arthur of Cadi! Naturally, he
says nothing. He would not wish you
to think that he stands between me
and my people; he would not admit
that because of him. I must lose a
kingdom and a home! No, I do not fear
him: it Is not that. But as I am cursed,
as my nation is cursed, with the fatal
ity of delay, I do not practice what I
preach. An idla stream Invites me to
drift upon it and I let my bark go
where it will. Some day It will be dif
ferentâah! that splendid 'some day!' "
Esther had but the vaguest ideas of
these momentous matters to which he
referred, nor would she speak of them.
That some grave quarrel had driven
the two men apart was very evident,
but how it had come about, or of its
nature, she could- not form any im
pression. The stranger's confidence in
vited her own. She did not fear to in
terrogate him in her tuin.
"Have you known Doctor Xavier
long, Prince? Was he once a friend of
yours?"
"I will not deny it. I could not fair
ly. The fault is neither his nor mine â
it is caprice and a woman. Miss Venn,

to do with either. Abjure the crimes
of your sex. Let me find a
main's heart and . a woman's eyes
when I coma to the chateau. It is a
promise â is it agreed that I am to
come?" .*sr.Â« :."Â¦'.
She was conscious of a new note in
his address; and her heart beat a
little quickly when she said:
"Shall I promise for "same day,'
then?" ;>: r 
"Xo," he said; "for to-night, that
you will be my friend!"
He held out his hand to her. re
peating the words. She did not know
what to say. Desiring his friendship
exceedingly, she could but stammer:
"I will tell you in Spain, Prince â
some day â some day."
When he had left her she remem
bered for the first time that the had
forgotten to call him "Highness."
Madame Julia arrived at the hotel
in time for dejeuner on the following
morning. Esther had thought much
of . the' Prince's words during tho
night, but she hesitated to speak of
their meeting until she discovered
that Julia was already aware both of
his arrival In Paris and of the en
counter in the corridor. For the first
time, since she had known her Esther
perceived that this fickle woman was
displeased with her and strangely
capricious. She did not complain, she
uttered no accusation, but sullenly re
tired to her own room and forbade
any one to come to her. Not until
they were together in the train for
the south did she seem to recent her
outbreak; and then, bursting into
tears, sh? kissed Esther passionately
and protested that she wished her
happiness.
"You were right to see him. dear. Of
course, you know my brother's wish..
You arc to to his wife some day. Why
should vou not have met him!"
Esther could not answer her. She
trembled like one grown suddenly
cold. She did not know whether it
were with pleasure or fear.
CHAPTER IX.
When Esther awpke In her room
upon the following morning she dis
covered a strange maid at her bed
side. The girl said that her name was
Suzanne and that she had been en
gaged by Madame Julia to accompany
them to the south. Esther liked her
face and did not hesitate to Invite her
confidence.
"Do you come from Paris, Su
zanne?" "*?:
"From Aries, mademoiselle; but I
was with monsieur at the Chateau St.
Paul, and I am to accompany you
there to-day. All your things are
packed and the tickets are taken. ' We
are going from Charing Cross at 11
o'clock." S. Â¦Â¦;... .?=;Â» 'Â¦Â¦Â¦:
Esther could scarcely believe her
cars. Dr. Xavier, she remembered,
had often spoken of his chateau on
the borders of Spain; but that he con
templated such an early departure
from London was never in her
thoughts. The events of last night un
doubtedly inspired â¢ such a hasty
change of plans. They quitted London
because of that unhappy affair In the
garden, and their journey, In some
way, resembled a flight. This reflec
tion troubled her not a little. The
news was so unlooked for that she
could not at once realize It. ' â¢'-
"Does the doctor accompany us,
Suzanne?" she asked, dressing hastily
and with little care. "He did not
speak of this last night, and I had no
Idea we were going away so soon. I
certainly did not think it would be un
til Madame Julia returned."
Suzanne had no time for expana
tiong. She busied herself about the
room as though all the responsibility
of an anxious days were hors.
"We shall find madame at Paris,"
she said, stolidly. "It would be a pity
that she should return when we are
going. Monsieur has left th-Â» house
already and will meet us at the cha
teau. He asked me to say that he ia
sorry we must go alone; but we shall
do very well, you and I, mademoiselle,
for, of course, it is my own country
and I shall not lose myself there. Mon
sieur has left a letter for you in your
own room. We have not any time to
lose, but we need not hurry. Ah,
mademoiselle, we are lucky to go to
the Chateau St. Paul â it Is the most
beautiful house In all the world! Such
flowers, such gardens; and Toulouse
so near, when one begins to
want the shops. You know
Toulouse, mademoiselle, no? Then
monsieur will drive you there, and
you will say that It is Paris at the foot
of the mountains. I love the South'
This England is bo cold and sad. Whei
summer comes it only teases you and
goes away again before you know it is
here. It is always summer at the
Chateau St. Paul."
Suzanne had spoken of a letter from
Doctor Xavier; and this was delivered
<o Esther at the breakfast table. She
found it couched in affectionate words,
but brief, as the maid's instructions.
The doctor said, shortly, that business
of the gravest importance had called
him from London and would detain
him for some days. Ha was disap
Â»polnted that they should not make the
Journey to Chateau St. Paul together;
but Esther, he was sure, would excusw
him and weald hasten to his sister who
awaited her in Paris.
"London has nothing left," he wrote,
"why should we linger there? We shall
breathe in the mountains, camarade.
The purpose we have set ourselves to
achieve needs God's fresh air and the
breezes of the hill-lands. We shall find
them at the Chateau St. Paul. I count
upon your interest and fidelity. To
nlpht at the Ritz Hotel* in Paris you
will, find my sister Julia. She will be
your guide until I come. For the rest,
the maid has all things necessary. Do
not epeak of the little gift I am leaving
for youâ these things are business and
friendship must not make them im
possible. I greet my little colleague
fraternally, and am her devoted, Xav
ier de Montalvan."
The gift of which he spoke was a*i
ivory purse containing English gold
and bank-notes to the value of a hun
dred pounds. Esther did not resent
this gift nor was she unwilling to
make use of it. She had never hidden
it from herself that she might be the
instrument of her patron's enduring
fame; and furthermore, the idea of be
ing alone upon the Continent without
money had at once occurred to her as
something even her courage could not
face. The tenor of the letter, indeed,
invited her confidence; and she began
to be not unpleasantly agitated at the
thought of seeing other countries and
other cities. When Suzanne announced
that the carriage was at the door, she
put on her cloak and hat with the ex
pectations of one who is going upon
some unlooked-for holiday; and from
that time until her arrival in Paris at
half-past 5 o'clock, she confessed that
she had no interest but those of the
changing pictures about her. The
sunny scene, the lake-like channel,
Calais with its babel of tongues, the
dreary sand-dunes by Boulogne, Amiens
and its tunnels," the hedgeless
monotonous plains of Northern France;
and lastly the grim fortifications, the
towering houses, the busy streets, the
bewildering labyrinths of that Paris
she had imagined so often, carried her
as In a dream to her journey's end.
And now Suzanne chattered â how
France inspired her! Esther said such
a talker she had never listened to; but
she was none the less glad that
Suzanne was with her at the Gare du
Nord to order about the chattering
porters and to lead her safely through
that deafening maze. ' " -
"Is it a big hotel, Suzanne?" she
asked, when they had left the station
and were clattering away toward the
boulevards. "Shall we get a room, do
you think?"
Suzanne was almost too amazed to
speak. As if any one who had not got
a room would go to the Ritz Hotel!
"Monsieur Xavier telegranhed this
morning, as If he would not,
moiselle! In France, he can command
anything, oh, all the world knows
Monsieur de Montalvan! There will be
the best rooms for him; and we shall
house and that woke me up," che said,
naturally enough. "Then, "while I
stood at the window, a man cried out,
and, of course, I was very much afraid.
I did not know what to think."
"Certainly you would not. The
friends who visited me to-night were
from the country of Cadi, Miss Venn;
some of them are Spanish mountain
eers; others are of the kingdom of
Andorra. They, sang at my request.
You hesitate to believe, perhaps, that
â¢I am a romantic person; but the re
verse Is very much thÂ« case. The note
of song, the perfume of a flower can
recreate a country for me. When I
hear Buch a wild hill song as you
heard to-night, I quit the cities and be
come a free man of the woods again.
My heart Is in Spain and will ever be
60. Some day, let your happiness and
opportunities be what they may, you
may know the same longing for your
own country â for a lane in that pretty
Devonshire you have left, or a scene
associated with your childhoodâ as I
have known to-night. I ''could wish
you no better fortune than to hope
that you will be able to gratify such
a natural desire. There is nothing
on earth quite eo bitter as expatria
tion from the land of your birth."
It was plain to Esther that he suf
fered much In this admission; and
while the vague innuendos of his
promise perplexed her, and she could
not imagliui under what circumstances
ehe could be an exile from England,
ehe perceived that his regret was very
real, and that all this splendor of
home and power cf riches meant noth
ing to him If it might not lead him
back ultimately to the land of his
fathers.
"I could never leave my own country
forever," the exclaimed, sympathetical
ly; "Whatever new ties might bind
me, I should thh.k of Devonshire and
my childhood. If you wiEh me to go
abroad with you, please let It be on
the understanding that I can come
home when I wish. I could not con
cent to go otherwise, Doctor Xavier."
He looked at her in a kindly way,
and smiled at her womanly stipula
tion.
"Tussuf rives me a good account vt
you. I hear that you are a willing pu
pil and are following my prescriptions
faithfully. The alarm which you suf
fered to-night will t>e useful if it
teaches you that courage is one of the
finest gifts of your womanhood. There
ere many things to alarm us in life, if
we do not use our brains and ask our
selves if we are right to t>e afraid. Of
that, however. I do not wish to speak
any more. The men who have quarrel
ed must settle their own differences.
They are nothing to me. I am more
concerned in your own experiences.
Miss Venn. You must forgive me If I
question you a little closer."
Esther said that she was very will
ins to answer him and in her own
simple way tried to tell him of the
treatment Ehe had undergone ted of
its effects as the realized them.
"I am much stronger and very
happy. Doctor," she said. "The
baths do me a great deal of good.
Of course it is very quiet and
restful here, and I feel as though all
the cares of life had been suddenly
taken from me. I do not want to go
away; and yet 1 have the energy to
do all sorts of mad things. The garden
is a fairyland; sometimes I wonder If
I really am Esther Venn or somebody
else. Every one has been bo kind to
me. I can not speak too well of the
servants."
He nodded his head; and taking a
lamp from a bracket, he held it high
above her head that he might see her
face more clearly.
"Let me look at you, Esther," he
said; "let me see if I can be'.ieve you."
She looked ud at him, a little
ashamed at his scrutiny; but under
standing it, nevertheless. For quite a
long time he regarded her as a sculp
tor might have regarded a statue upon
which he was working. The result,
aparently, gratified him. He set down
the lamp and vent on with his ques
tions.
"You ray that you can rest here; it
is a good sign. A disposition to rest
is one of the secrets of health; and
health is indispensable to our success.
Miss Venn. For the present we will
go on as we have begun. When we
have left England for the mountains.
It will be time enough to speak of
change. If I am gratified with what
has been done, at ths same time; I
make no rash promises. Your obedi
ence is a kindness to me and earns my
cratitude. Add to it by permiting m e
to make vet one more observation â I
think it will interest rou."
He turned upon his heel, and enter-
Ins his own study Esther heard him
unlock a bureau and afterward lock it
again. When he returned, he carried
upon his arm a long blue robe with a
hood attached and a girdle trailing
upon the ground. This he asked her
to put on, and helped her to do with
an interest that he could not conceal.
Esther perceived that the c!oak was of
a strange fashion ar.d apparently old;
she had never seen a more perfect
shade of blue or one so rich and
pleasing. Why she should be asked to
wear such a robe, or for v."hat purpose,
the could net conceive. That it came
from Spain the never doubted. She
had seen a picture by Murillo in the
National Gallc-ry. and the Madonna
there was gowned in stioh a cloak as
this. Moreover, a cross of diamonds
edorned the hood and there were other
religious emblems In gold and Jewels,
while a short cape falling from the
shoulders was embroidered with pas
sion flowers. When Esther had put
the robe on, she discovered that it
was too long for her. and fell in folds
about her feet: but the Doctor had no
sooner fastened the silver clasD be
neath her chin than he uttered a
leud cry cf astonishment and stepped
back like one delighted ct his handi
work.
"Inez del Cadi!â it is Inez del Cadi!"
he muttered, again and again; and as
though to convince himself beyond
doubt, he lit up other lamps, which the
roses shielded, until a dazzling light
fell upon them and gave a newer ra
diance to the splendid blue and ths
ehecn of the glimmering cross.
"It Is a miracle, mademoiselleânoth
ing less than a miracle!" the doctor
went on, enraptured. "Some day you
shall profit by it. I can not tell you
now; you would not understand."
Esther confessed that understanding
was impossible; nevertheless, she
would have ventured a question but
for the sudden clang of a bell In the
outer courtyard and an answering echo
of footsteps heard upon the gravel
paths. This tinkling: signal immedi
ately arrested Doctor Xavier's atten
tion, and, listening: intently for a min
ute, he appeared to be the possessor
of Eome new Idea.
"Stay," he exclaimed, "my friends
returnâ I must not refuse them. Walt
hereâ it is lucky and may help us."
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALII
2The carriage stopped with his words,
and they alighted quickly and went
up to" the splendid apartment he had
engaged for her in the Avenue Hoche.
Esther has never forgotten that great
white salon dimly lighted by shaded
lamps, so full of riches, so dainty In
Its minutest ornament; that salon in
which she stood to say "Good night"
to her friend and benefactor. For a
moment she paw him, his kindly eyes
beaming upon her, his cloak thrown
back, his white glove crushed between
Â¦his Iron fingers; then, without a word,
he was gone, and Suzanne, her maid!
stood at her elbow.
"You have given me life itself!" she
exclaimed. "I could never thank you
enough! I have no words to thank
you. You are the best, the only friend
I- have ever known!"
He drew her to him and kissed her.
- "Call me that alwaj-s, camarade â call
me that whatever befall."
His mood alarmed her not a little.
All the best instincts of her generous
nature were anakened by this appeal.
She felt like one who is asked by a
father, '"Do you trust me?" She longed
to tell him much, but could say so
little.
. "Yes," he said, "I made a promise
and I have redeemed it. You are the
most beautiful woman In Paris to
night. The world is open to you. You
have in your hands a power which is
the most subtle a -woman can possess.
Use it for the good of those who win
your love and confidence. . In my own
time we nill bestow our secret upon
others, but that day is not yet. Per
haps it may never be. Destiny plays
strange tricks with us when opportuni
ty is our need. I am more concerned
to-night, Esther, that you should call
me friend. It may mean something in
the days to come."
"You have kept itâ kept it a
hundred times:" she exclaimed re
proachfully. "I have known noth
ing but happiness in your house.
You have shown me another world.
How can you ask such a question!"
He turned away and looked at the
shimmering pavement upon which a
few flakes of the drifting snow had
begun to melt.
"Esther."- ho said presently, "I made
a' promise to you in London six months
ago. Say. carr.arade. have I kept it
or have I failed?"
A, ecu; tented smile crossed his face,
â¢ nd he drew hor arm through his own.
"It is time tor us to go home, cama
rafie," ho said; "our work is done."
She did not read the meaning of his
words aright, nor could she quite un
derstand that almost pathetic kindness
with which he had treated her since
they chitted Â£pain. The vast rooms
were still crowded when she returned
to them. Eyes followed her now as
they had followed her two hours ago.
She heard the echo of voices, the
music of the violins; and then she
passed out to the crowded courtyard,
&nd finding their brougham, she asked
why thev were alone.
"My sister has gone on to the house
cf the Comte de Fleurv," was his an
swer. *"Do not be anxious about her,
camarado; she is old enough to take
care of herself. I wish to talk to you
a little to-night; we shall have few
opportunities."
The carriage rolled out into the
broad Faubuurg St. Germain, and the
jdarkness of the gloomy street fell
upon them. Esther became aware that
the, doctor was still holding her hand
end regarding her with those deep-set
eyes which, she thought, could read
her very sou!. For five mouths now
she fts^d been as closely associated with
this stN^nge personality as any daugh
'ter witny the father of her house;
nevertheless she could say that he was
almost a stranger still. Moods of gen
tleness or of irritation, absent moods,
the zeal of the scientist, sometimes the
passion of the fanatic and the exile,
baffled and repelled her. To-night his
voice was caressing as a child's. He
held her hand affectionately while he
spoke. She understood that he had to
tell of giave matters.
The doctor, indeed, had already re
turned, acd stood now in the door of
the conservatory, watching her with
that close scrutiny of which she was
conscious bometimc-s even when she
could not see his face. A little to her
surprise, he did not address her com
panion, nor did the Prince wait for
him to do so. Simply saying, "Until
to-morrow!" the young man bowed
and left her, and she went up, in some
confusion, to her friend.
"I have beeu wailing for you," 6he
pleaded. "it must be very late."
She was a little afraid of his sud
den ardor and she stood up to escape
u -gesture which was almost a caress.
"I have no right to see you," she
protested. "And there is Doctor Xa
vier â he is looking for me!"
and restrained her. This young Span
iard of the cities never once left her In
doubt. A child would have under
stood him â he was utterly unable to
hide hSs impulses either for good or
eviL Esther knew to-night that he
loved het; she read his story in every
glance.
"Yes," he continued impulsively,
throwing away his cigarette and bend
ing over her until she could feel his
hot breath upon her cheek, "you are
the most beautiful thing in all the
world! Paris has told you so, but it
is the truth. Your face haunts me â it
haunts me, I Bay! I shall come to the
Avenue Hoche to-morrow â I shall fol
low you wherever you go; I defy you
to forbid me â "
"There Is the carriage, mademoiselle,
and the Bo!s. It is not good to be in
the house when the sun Is shining. You
must make friends "in Parisâ ah! you
will not be long about that! When one
is beautiful all the doors are open!
Take, my advice, mademoiselle, and
drive to-day. We can think about
England afterward. Oh, the good God
forbid that it does not snow when we
go out there!" !JSÂ§Rfim8^
Esther, acting still like one in a
dream, said that it might be as Su
zanne dictated; and afterward she
dressed herself, deliberately and but
Esther put the letter down, and
standing at the open window she
watched the people In the sunny
avenue below. Her first thought was
that they were strangers to her, and
that she had been left utterly alone in
this great city. That Doctor Xavier
would change his mind, or retprn, she
knew to be impossible. Every sentence
in that letter spoke finality, the end of
those months of wonder and surprise.
The play was done with; she must face
the world alone. Esther pressed her
hands to her forehead like one Incapa
ble of clear thought, while she asked
herself many times what she should do,
whither turn, where seek a friend! Was
it all real, or were those months of
mystery but creatures of imagination?
Would she awake in London in her
garret, the unknown, uncared-for
country girl? The glass forbade that
hallucination. Her own. beauty was a
precious thing to her" now. And none
could rob her of it. Esther stood sud
denly and asked herself if that were
so! Would Francisco Xavier'S-gift en
dure?. Some whisper of an evil premo
nition told her that it might not
Suzanne came into the room anon and
asked her what she wished to do. The
girl was evidently aware of her mas
ter's^ departure; but she waited for
Esther to speak of it.
"XAVIER DE MONTALVAN."
"Dear Miss Venn: Your determina
tion to consider me Btill as your friend
will allow something to that necessity
which compels me to quit Paris
so abruptly, and will forgive the
brief farewell which alone is pos
slbie in this emergency. Such facts of
my life as have become known to you
during the pleasant months we have
labored in a common cause have
taught you that, if science is much to
me, my country is more. Events,
< hanging and swift, call an exile from
his retreat and command his service.
My fellow-countrymen summon me and
I go to them, whether it be for good or
i'l I know not; but as a patriot and a
servant I accept tho call. The same
cause compels, me, for the moment, to
restore to you that independence of life
and action which I asked of you six
months ago. We have set ourselves an
aim and we have reached it. More elo
quent that any words of mine must be
that vi/ice of Paris which you have
heard so unmistakably and will hear
again in these happy days which I
trust await you. The gift which you
possess is the rarest and most precious
which women can win. It will open
every door to you. Set no confines to
your ambition, save those which your
own character and actions may trace.
Use it as becomes your wise discretion
and your gentle disposition. Remem
ber that there Is nothing beyond your
reach if your wisdom is your master.
Some day, it may be, yenir destiny and
mine tjrUl draw us together again. I
leave that to the unwritten future, but
for the present I .say that the man of
science thanks you. that the friend re
members you. The rooms which you
occupy in Paris are your own, for your
occupatic-n or disposal as you may
think fit. And, furthermore, the Bank
of France has my instructions to pay
to you upon the first days of January
and July in each year the sum of
twenty-five thousand francs, that you
may be deprived of nothing to which
my own way of life has accustomed
you. This trifling obligation you will
permit tÂ»o a man whose vanity you have
flattered and whose scientific fame you
have assured. Believe me that his
farewell is not spoken lightly or with
out a sense of that kindness and pati
ence he has suffered at your hands,
and you will find him always in mem
ory and grateful homage,
"Your devoted
She indicated an envelope upon the
large writing table at the farther end
of the room and Esther recognized
at once the strange handwriting of
her friend and muster. She had been
not a little mystified last night by the
enigmatical words which Dr. Xaxier
addressed to her, and now when she
heard that he had quitted the house
and that this letter was his message,
she oi'<?ned it very anxiously and read
it through to the end as something at
present beyond her understanding. The
formality of it startled her. She had
not reed many lines when she realized
it was a letter of farewell.
"14 AVENUE HOCHE,
it seems so selfish to go on." * r
"Not selfish at all, mademoiselle.
Every one 'goes on' in Paris. Perhaps
Madame Julia will never come back at
all. I do not know.. There is the doc
tor's letter."
Esther laughed at her drollery, but
she was, none the less, a little troubled
at Julia's absence.
"Did mudame leave no message,
Suzanne? t>he must be staying at a
friend's house. Perhaps I ought not to
have my breakfast until she comes;
hill lands had .taught her to shrink,
the romance of her life had been
found. Esther, recalling the scene at
the Duke's house, closed her eyes and,
like one who dreamed while waking,
she repeated Arthur's words.
"He loves me," she said, "he loves
meâ -and to-morrow I shall see him!"
There is no hour more susreme in
a young girl's life than this. Content
in her dreams Esther fell asleep at
last and did not wake until the morn
ing was far advanced, and a newer
stronger y oIce oi Paris echoed in the
avenue beneath her window. She
knew It was very late, and in that
6uspicion the untiring Suzanne con
firmed her when she came bustling
into the room with the steaming cof
fee and the dainty bath gown.
"Ah, mademoiselle, how you x have
slept! It is almost time for dejeuner.
And the doctor left so early. Do you
know it is 11 o'clock â of course not;
we never know what time it is when
we arc asleep."
"At what time did Madame Julia re
turn, Suzanne?" she asked of the bus
tling maid; "it was very late, I am
sure."
. Suzanne, skimming about the room
like a bird, answered gayly:
"Ah, she was late enough, made
moiselle, for she is not yet returned.
It is always like that in Paris. You
walk, you drive, you laugh, you eat â
but sleep! â heaven, who would sleep
here! There's so much to see. It
would be a betise to sleep, made
moiselle."
"If your people like me," she said,
expressing all her doubt. "Are you
sure of it. dear Arthur? Have you
thought what the consequences of dis
like mlzht be for us?"
He leant back upon the cushions and
tried to play the philosopher.
"I never quarrel with the present,
Esther," he said. "We lose half the
happiness of life when we ask ques
tions about to-morrow. Does It really
concern us. except sentimentally? I
am a rich man; and whether I tnaka
my home in France or in Spain you
will share it. That is enough for me.
If Gaudarez comes back and tells me
unpleasant things I shall not cross the
frontier. The lamb who lies down with
the wolf is not accustomed to dine
upon mutton. If Cadi says "no,* very
well; we will return to Paris and
shake the snow off our heels. But it
is foolish to anticipate that which may
not happen. My people are romantic
and our little story will please them.
I have implored , Gaudarez to lose no
time. He understands how much de
pends upon him. The rest of the pro
gramme Is our own. We arrive at
Foix about sunrise; it Is a long drive
through the hills, but my horse can do
it in eight hours. .We should be at St.
Girons in time for dinner. The place
She listened patiently, although her
suspicions were awakened. From tha
first she had told herself that sooner
or later a cloud would darken the hor
izon of her happiness. Here was the
truth at last. Esther would not hide
It from herself that if this law of Cadi
were strictly enforced, her marriage
could be nothing but morganatic.
Spain would not recognize her; she
would occupy the least enviable posi
tion that can fall to a wife.
"Ah," he said, "my people will for
give me when they see you â I never
dc-ubted it! They must forgive me!"
She looked up at him a little*
troubled.
"Are they so very terrible, then, your
people, Arthur?"
"They are not tenibl*. they are
merely foolish. But the law Is there;
and I am the first man who has ever
broken it." ;â¢
"I do not understand you, dearest;
please tell me."
"There is nothing to tell," he con
tinued, with a gayety which was so
plainly forced that It did not deceive
her. "By the law of Cadi I am sup
posed to marry a Spaniard. I hava
not done so. Very well, my people will
be amused. At first, perhaps, they will
grumble; but afterward, when they
see you. little wife â ah, thenâ"
He kissed her again, like one who
would thus silence her suspicions. He
did not tell her that by tha law of
Cadi the penalty for that which he had
done was death.
"You should have told me before.
dear," she pleaded, with a gentle pro
test. "I do not think It was right of
you to have kept it from me."
He mocked her fears, but so caress
ingly that she could not resist him.
"The girl who has reigned In Paris
will certainly reign In my own coun
try," he said. "Are you not the most
beautiful thing in all the world? Let
them search Europe â where would they
find such a wife for me? You know
that they could not, Esther â the- gla33
tells you so every day! You arÂ» minÂ»â
mine! and I would not give you up for
all the kingdoms of thÂ» world!"
He went on to blame himself for his
candor, assuring her that thÂ» very law
had long been forgotten in Spain and
promising her .that when she met old
Xavier again she would be tha mis
tress and not the pupil.
"We are a free people, but wÂ» lova
our Prince. While he observes tha
common law, nothing Is denied him.
They will fete us to the end of time.
little wife. We shall dine all day and
feast all night Tou must like Cadi!
I say that it Is the greatest city in
Europe, and the palace haa been the
treasure house of kings. Quadaxez
goes on to make everything ready for
us. I have ordered carriages to meet
us at Foix to-morrow at dawn, and we
shall reach St. Girons in time for
breakfast. Ah, manw, what days of
love before us â what days of love!"
exactly as he wished me to do. It re
mains to be known if I am wise."
He did not admit to Esther the grave
doubt which harassed him; in truth,
his object appeared to be so to occupy
her time that she should have neither
the leisure to repent nor thÂ» will to
draw back. And in this he easily suc
ceeded. It seemed to her but yester
day that he had said, "I love you!"
and the words were still In her ears
when Suzanne awoke her upon her
wedding day. From that moment her
Impressions were blurred and vague.
She remembered the sunny streets of
Paris, the white satin clinging to her
subtle limba, the orange blossoms twin-
Ing about her splendid veil â but
distantly, as in a dream. Paris said
that the Church of St. Eustache had
rarely been so crowded. Esther recol
lected little of that service. She re
called the press of figures, lights
against a background of gold; towering
palms, the face of a priest, another face
âthat of the man she loved, close to
her own and whispering often Ja
t'aime! The concluding scenes were at
the church door where the beggars of
Paris pressed close upon the skirts o?
the rich. Esther remembered driving
away In the Baronne's brougham to the
Hotel d'Arbols t In the Faubourg St. Ger
main. A hundred women kissed her
there, men pressed her hands; she
heard the music of a string band; she
saw her husband everywhere, his uni
form of white and gold conspicuous
even in that abode of color. Then,
swiftly, the scene changed. Maids
were busy over her. She put on a
pretty gown of green and gold with
sable about the neck of it. Congratu
lations were showered upon her. She
passed down the Immense stalrcasa
where the soldiers of the serried ranks
were those of the guards of Paris. A
carriage conveyed her quickly to the
station. She remembered that Gau
darez, the captain, chaffed her hus
band about the tickets. A bell rang,
a horn was blown, the train steamed
out of the station upon its way to tha
south. She was alone with her hus
band at last. The coupe which had
been engaged for them seemed so full
of flowers that Esther thought their
very odor insupportable. Arthur's first
act was to let down one of the win
dows a little way and to speak of his
friend Gaudarez.
"He Is a , splendid fellow," he ex
claimed, waving a- hand to a distant
figure on the platform, "and he follows
us to-night. Of course, our people must
know at once. He will go on to Cadi
to-morrow. It is a long journey, and
I could not take you there without a
rest. Come, little wife, there are none
to see â I must kiss you! â must!â
He covered her face with passionate
kisses and holding her close with a
Spaniard's ardor, he made the confes
sion Cue to her.
He settled himself upon the sofa and
watched her face intently while he
spoke.
"Then let us go back a little way,
and I will ask you a question. What do
you know of my countryâ what do you
know of. Cadi, Miss Venn?"
"I know; little. Prince, practically
nothing." .
"I have always heard that the Eng
lish are unpopular in Spain," she re
marked, aimlessly. "Why should I be
the exception." , .
"Because you are the individual and
not the nation. It Is only . a lunatic
who quarrels with others because they
are hot fellow-countrymen. I have
been twice round â¢ the globe and it
seems* to me that a man who- is born in
San Francisco is -at heart much the
same as the man who" is born in Paris.
He eats, . drinks and sleeps; he loves
and r is lovedâ lucky man! Let us leave
him for a moment and return, to Spain.
I have not a timetable with me or I
would have looked out our train; but I
think it. will be the Sud express, Miss
Venn,' at- half-past seven In the
evening." . A Â¦;-
She. put down her cup, determined to
be serious. i*-^Â£v
"Why., do you speak, like this.
Prince?" she protested; "why do you
offend me?",. Â¦â¢:â¢'. '"
"Then,you are offended? No, I refuse
to believe it. You are merely unaware
of the circumstances. I will tell you
about them; I came to do so â if you do
not forbid me?"
' "No, I am anxious to hear them."
"I have always believed Doctor
Xavier to be my friend," she confessed
with some concern. "If I do not know
"Upon mine? Oh, please do not say
that. I have never doubted Doctor
Xavier's honor."
"Then you are probably the first per
son who has paid him such a compli
ment. I came here to-night to recite a
little page of history. Do not imagine
that I am the hero of the storyâ far
from it; I am the dupe. Francisco
Xavier shall get his Ceserts, no more,
no less. 1 will tell you the truth about
him." V.. :
"Doctor Xavier went away very
early," she said, ; off ering him the only
possible explanation she could give.
"I had no idea he was going, or I
should not have allowed you. to call
upon me. He has gone to Spain; the
affairs of his country call him there."
"Of his country and of mine; of
course. Do you know what I am ask
ing myself just now, Miss Venn? I see
that you do not. Well, I am asking
myself precisely how . far Francisco
Xavier has played upon your^credull
ty-" <yii
She did not tell him that she was not.
His attack was so swift, his manner so
irresistible," that she had neither the
opportunity to forbid nor the will to
deny him. For the first time since the
Doctor had left her, she realized that
she was not alone in Paris. Why
should she send away the one friend
she had found? : C if- : v-^-V;;^V,v ;
all about it I am sure you are anxi
ous." .
â¢ She had nothing to urge against it,
although the doubt he had expressed
remained in her thoughts. He, how
ever, was full of his .scheme, and
chiefly of that part of it which con
cerned his kingdom.
"Old Xavier believes that he has out
witted me, but we shall see!" he said,
like one anxious. to be convinced. "You
owe I him much, Esther, and we . must
be kind , to ' him. I have always been
willing to honor him if he would con
sent to .serve. But he desires to be the
master. He ' believes that he can
rule in Cadi and that the. people will
banish me. I imagine he is greatly
mistaken. You see that I am doing
CHAPTER XII.
The marriage of the reigning Prince
of Cadi to one whom Paris had already
learned to call "La Belle Inconnue,"
was tho brief sensation of a winter
month. People discussed little else for
many days. A beautiful woman had
come to the city; she had been seen,
she had conquered. The pretty ro
mance made gossip for tne cafes Nvhile
it entertained the salons with eloquent
mendacities. From the chroniques
scandaleuses you got a hundred ver
sions, every one of them a lie. Some
said that the bride was an American of
fabulous wealth; others declared that
her English was acquired, ar.d that she
came from Spain. There were twenty
apologies for the hasty marriage, and
each of them more false than the other.
In the end, Paris came to the con
clusion that it really was a young
man's story. It remained for the
Prince's friends to declare that he had
sold himself for good bank notes, and
that his repentance would be speedy.
Esther knew nothing of this, nor did
any unkind word reach her ears. She
had promised to marry Prince Arthur,
because she believed that by marriage
he would save his kingdom. So little,
until thl3 moment of decision, had she
dared to consider the question, that
even until the end she could not wholly
understand how greatly she loved and
was beloved in her turn. The morning
brought his roses; together they break
fasted at Durand's or one of the great
er cafes. The afternoon found them
driving in the Bols: there were dinners
and theaters at night. â¢ What time had
she for that preparation so necessary!
If it had not been for the Prince's
friend, the untiring laughing, scheming
Pauline. Baronne d'Arbois, Esther de
clared that she would never have been
married at all.
â¢ Pauline, Baronne d'Arbois, has been a
leading figure in the later-day world of
Paris. The church, the state, the
salon, the theater, have, in turn, been
ruled by her. Prince Arthur had no
friend more enthusiastic, perhaps none
so frequently embarrassing. When
Pauline heard of his approaching mar
riage, when she learned that his bride
was alone and friendless in the city, no
carriage was fast enough to carry her
to Esther's side.
"Ah, my child!" she exclaimed in
rapture, "what a splendid secret â and
all Paris knows of it! I have come here
at dear Arthur's request. You must
let me be a sister to you. You must
positively leave everything in my
hands."
Esther was overawed by this well
schooled woman of the world, and
cheerfully gave up her independence.
She had exacted from Arthur a prom
ise that their marriage should be In
some part a secret, and he had acqui
esced willingly enough.
"Secret or public, what does it mat
ter if if gives me Esther!" he an
swered. "I will be married in a cellar,
if it please you. Of course, we must
not forget your English birth. There
will be a ceremony at the embassy and
afterward at St. Eustache. The Bar
onne will be there â no gate in Paris
could shut her out. We shall have to
tolerate her because we are going to
her house to breakfast afterward. I
have thought about all the rest, and It
is quite settled. We shall take the Sud
express to my chateau at St. Girons.
Guadarez, the captain of my . civil
guard and my oldest friend, will go on
to Cadi with the news. If, as I expect,
the people receive it with acclamation,
we shall spend a fortnight at the cha
teau and then visit our capital. You
need not ask if I look forward to that
day! Ah, to take you to them, Esther,
to take the most beautiful thing in all
the world!". - if'--
"How should you? It ia not old Xa
vier's habit to make a confidant of hl3
friends. Even I sometimes fail to un
derstand him. Why. for instance, has
he left you in Paris? Shall I say that it
is because he wishes you to be my
wife?"
"No, no! indeed no!" she cried, draw-
Ing away from him; but he held her
hand and drew her toward him in spite
of herself.
"Let us make an end of the riddles."
he said. "You know that I love you.
you have known it since that night I
first found you In this city and spoke
the promise. Can such a man as I am
be mistaken? If I were a boy, the son
of one cityâ yes, I might deceive my
self; but I, who have traveled twice
round the world, who have known the
best and the worst of men and women
â Esther, could I deceive myself? No,
no, I love you with all a man's heartâ
I shall love you to my life's end! Es
ther, you can save me â you can save
my country. Come with me, come to
Cadi as my wife!"
She tried to silence him. but the
words failed her; and overwhelmed and
trembling, she let him close his arms
about her and felt his lips upon her
own, and knew that her destiny was
this.
cries In the streets were for Xavier de
Montalvan. The papers that I signed
were his handiwork; the laws were his
laws. But the army was mine! I drove
him out of Cadi and France approved.
Henceforth I was my own master In
name and deedâ you are Interested,
Miss Venn? I do not weary you?"
Esther, unable -to take her eyes from
his face, showed how great her interest
was.
"But you, yourself. Princeâ why are
ycu not at Cadi now?"
"I will tell you in a word. Because I
have not fulfilled Cadi's law."
He shifted uneasily In his seat and
turned away from her while he spoke.
"By the custom . at a thousand
years," he said, "the princes of my
country must marry within a year of
their accession. That year is up In ten
days from this day. If I let the tenth
day pass and remain as I am, my king
dom goes to another â my rights, my
possessions, my authority are taken
from me.. Francisco Xavier is ban
ished, but his name remains beloved
of his friends. In ten days he will
achieve his ends. Do you know why he
quitted Paris this morning?"
He turned his ardent eyes upon her,
but she could not meet that steadfast
gaze, and stammering a commonplace
would have concealed her agitation
thus.
, "I am very sorry for you. Prince. If
I had known â "
half aware of that which she was do
ing. In the park her carriage was
second to none. She knew that men
turned and stared at her, that women
whispered when she passed them by.
But their homage meant little. Two
questions agitated her unceasingly.
Why had Doctor Xavier left her in
Paris? What was her own future to
be? The generous allowance of which
the letter had spoken was a. recom
pense. In some way, unearned; and yet
in others her due. She was wise
enough to see that she had large claims
upon her benefactor. â¢ For six months
she had devoted herself, heart and soul,
to his service. Some humiliations were
inseparable from such an aim as he
pursued. Esther had given unstint
ingly, and this was her reward. She
was quite a long while before she un
derstood that her allowance was to be
two thousand pounds a year, and that
the" furniture and the rooms in the
Avenue Hoche were her own. When
she returned to those rooms at five
o'clock the drive had refreshed her, and
her first perturbation haa passed. She
was alone, truly; but how fortunate in
her loneliness! A letter from the Bank
of France Informed her that the sum
of one thousand pounds stood there to
her credit. The whole -*vorld was open
to her If she did not care to make Paris
her home. Perhaps she thought of
Devonshire and the cathedral city, and
of the lanes and gardens of her own
country. But if she had any mind to
visit them, an influence more potent
restrained her. She remembered the
THE SAN FRANCISCO- SUNDAY CALL.
She could not sleep, and the strange
room contributed to her unrest. It
was very tasteful, very complete; but
its old French furniture, its parquet
flooring, the long stiff glasses and the
plctureless walls robbed it of homeli
ness and suggested the visit. Esther
regretted in some way the pretty
chalet at Thonon and the life in the
country of vines. At the worst, she
thought, they would spend a few
Â¦weeks In Paris before returning to the
sunshine and the south. If she had
any consolation it was in her . own
precious secret, but half confessed
even to herself. Here in this city,
from whose sights and sounds the
Esther slept but little that night
Despite her desire to sleep, the scene
she had quitted haunted her and she
could not escape it. In some measure,
too, the ominous "good night" which
Doctor Xavier had spoken warned
her of impending change and of some
new -way of life at present undeclared.
She feared that such a change might
not be without Its dangers. The for
tune which had come to her might,
said an evil voice of foreboding, be
taken away. In moods of depression
she would imagine herself helpless,
friendless, the inconspicuous figure of
the theater's door. From such moods
the mirror was her habitual refuge.
She knew that she had become a very
beautiful woman.
CHAPTER XL
"Do you take tea, Prince?" she asked,
interrupting him with a commonplace.
He threw away his cigarette and held
out his hand. .
"From . you it will be nectar. We
Spaniards' po-lson ourselves with chocoÂ£
late; but you will make me your Eng
lish tea In Spain, and we shall call '5
o'clock' a fashion. Let us take, that
which is best from both countries and
begin with ourselves."
He laughed at his own idea, and be
gan to" sip the steaming, tea. â His jest
brought the blood to Esther's cheeks.
She was sure, that she ought to protest,
but she had not a word to say for her
self.
The ridula of it silenced her. . She
could neither answer nor .help him.
When Suzanne carried in the tea-tray,
she was relieved. She dreaded, she
knew not why, that which must. come
after.
"What have you to do with it? Yes,
as your Shakespeare says, 'That Is the
question.' â¢ Why did he quit Spain and
go to England? Why am I an idler in
Paris when I should be at the head of
my people? Is it not all a splendid puz
zle, a game of chess v.ith human fig
ures? Oh, do not think that he is not
cltvcr! There is iio-t a i:ner head in
Europe! I am no more able to stand
against him than the shingle against
the sea. Hut I make a move, neverthe
less; that is why I am here to-night."
anything of his past. I cannot blame
him. Why should he have told me.
Prince? What have I to do with it?"
He leaned back upon the cushions of
the sofa and laughed a little ironically.
"As I thought; it is scarcely, I imag
ine, a name to you."
"It certainly is no more."
"In your school days, perhaps, you
saw it' marked as a little yellow spot
upon the maps of Spain and France.
Yc-u heard that a Prince ruled it under
the suzerainty of the republic. You
have read that its people were Spanish,
wild mountaineers, hardy fellows of the
hills. If you had been a reader of
travelers'" booksâ which heaven grant
you are not! â you would haye known
that it is a rich country because of its
mines; and that in its capital, the town
of Cadi, there is the life, the gayety and
the society of an -older Paris. All that
is the schoolmaster's preparation for
our partible. One would have had to
read the newspapers very closely tÂ«
write the inner story of that fascinat
ing state. 1 am not a historianâ no, I
know .mo-re about a race horse than di
plomacy; but I will try to be your his
torian to-night. Cadi, Miss Venn, has
had many princes. I am the last of
them. Mr father died when I was 13
years old,, and, by the laws of my
country, a Regent was appointed. That
Kegent was Francisco Xavier, your
friend. He educated me, he was my
guardian, friend, until my twentieth
year. I trusted him like -a brother.
From- my earliest days I had been
taught" that the loyalty of my people
was. unalterable. /Judge of my awak
ening -.when I discovered in my. twen
tieth year that if I were the Prince of
Cadi in name,' Francisco Xavier was in
deed! He had won the allegiance my
youth had lost. me. .A united state was
united-no longer. My friends were the
youth.^the romance of. my, country; his
were: the "wisdom, the balance, thw sa
gacity. .Twelve . months later they
called me to the throne. ; I found my
self- a '.'splendid' nonenity... The very
Prince â was he not still In Paris? Es
ther's cheeks were burning when she
reflected that he might come to her.
But it was not with fear, for she knew
that he loved her.
â¢ * â¢ Â¦ i
He came at half-past five, driving a
pair of horses in a light mail-phaeton,
and wearing a long: coat trimmed with
sable and a cap to match It. The night
had set in chill and cold; filmy flakes
of snow began to fall as soon as the
sun had set. Esther was in the very
act of assuring Suzanne that she could
not possibly dine at a restaurant, when
the bell rang loudly, and that blithe
maid went hurrying away to answer it.
There had been many callers in the
Avenue Hoche since they came to Paris
â the flat had been besieged by idlers
abundantly; but Esther knew, with a
woman's instinct, that this was no
formal visitor, sent there at theydic
tates of curiosity. ,She was not at all
surprised when the Prince entered
without ceremony, and at once in-,
formed her that he knew of Doctor
Xavier' s absence.
"I defied you to forbid me,", he said
gailyi "and here I am. It is' snowing
outside, and my horses are gone. You
are far too generous to send me away,
Miss Venn. I appeal to your instincts
of pity." Â¦'hi'J'll
He slipped off his fur coat, upon
which the glistening drops of. snow
were melting, and delighted, apparent
ly, by her embarrassment, he spoke of
Francisco Xavier.
"So El Demonio has gone to Spain,"
he Bald; "I heard the news in the
Jockey Club this morning. Naturally
my friends In Paris hasten to 'remind
me of my misfortunes." 'Your cause is
lost.' they tell me, Just at the moment
when I am saying that It Is, won! Per
mit me a cigarette, and I will tell you
3Continued Next' Sunday.
He asked her "what men?" pre
tending to be ignorant of It; but she
persisted:
"I went to my window and the snow
was untrodden â then I looked again
and there were soldiers riding up!
What is it, dear? Please tell me?"
He made a brave effort, but he
could not conceal his apprehensions
from her, and s,o, holding both her hot
hands in his and kissing her, he put
the best face he could upon It.
"Something: has happened â perhaps
It is Gaudarez who has news for me. I
have sent Martinez to the gate. You
must lock your door and wait until I
come up. Of course, there Is no dan
ger, but it is as well to be careful in
this wild place. . You must not be
frightened, Esther. The people about
here are all my friends;, they would
do anything for me."
He. broke off abruptly and dropped
her hands. A woman's wild scream,
ringing through the hall below, gave
him the lie and left in his eyes the wild
look of a hunted man. He kissed Es
ther passionately, his pulse throbbed in
every vein.
"I will soon settle this," he cried;
"wait until I come." And without an
other word he went down the stairs
and she was alone again.
She did not lock the door, it occurred
to her even then that he might be
driven and return to her. Holding a
candle in her hand she took up a posi
tion at the stairs head and waited
more fearfully than she nad ever done
in all her life. The suspense was in
tolerable; the shadows upon the wind-
Ing stair she peopled with dreadful fig
ures. The worst was known now â the
swift cataclysm in which life, happi
ness, all might be lost. From the hall
below came the sound of angry argu
ment and of swords trailing upon the
boards. Arthur's voice, clear and dis
tinct above the others, was raised from
time to time In command or entreaty;
but it gave place Suddenly to a sharp
cry like that of a man stricken down
unawares. Esther belle\"ed that they
had killed her lover; she reeled
against the wall, the light fell from
her hands and she waited in utter
darkness. What awful crime had been
committed? The uncertainty drove
her as with a goad. She could hear
the clash of swords, the deep breath
ing of men fh' anger, the shuffling and
gasping cry of those who fight for life.
Hoarse shouts filled the house; they
"It is very silly of me, but I have
been frightened â and, Arthur, what
does it mean â why are those men at
St. Girons?"
These suspicions â unjustified, but
girlish â endured for a full five min
utes. Esther was quite ready to tell
herself that her acts were very ridicu
lous, and that the Norsemen were no
other than travelers crossing by niffht
to Spain, when a quick step upon the
stair turned her eyes to the door
again, and she was about to open it
when her husband burst in uncere-*
moniously and by word and manner
at once confronted her doubts.
"Where are you, Esther?" he asked;
and then perceiving her, exclaimed,
"why, you are still dressed!"
She told him , everything, without
disguise.
Such reflections caused her to be a
little preoccupied and to undress at her
leisure. She awoke from them sud
denly to remember what a long time
she had been, and was about to make
greater haste when, looking from the
window by chance, she beheld some
thing upon the mountain path which
Instantly arrested her attention and,
she knew not why, excited a swift sus
picion. But a quarter of an hour agp
the utter loneliness of . that road and
the solitude of the pass spoke elo
quently of the winter's night; but now,
observing it for the second time, she
perceived that there were horsemen
upon it, a straggling company riding
up in single file and making, as far
as she could Judge, for the postern of
the castle. The moonlight showed her
these figures with great distinctness.
Effulgent beams scintillated upon the
bright barrels of their rifles and sil
vered bit and spur and all their stern
accounterment. She thought that she
could place their captain, a cautious
horseman, who turned from time to
time to address a trooper near to him,
or who halted for whole minutes to
gether to observe the gate he approach
ed. Esther could not imagine why
those men came to St. Girons or what
their business there might be. If she
leaped to some wild idea of the truth,
her own precarious past was riot al
together unconcerned with it. From
the first she could not believe that such
happiness as had come to her could
endure. There must be a price, a sur
prise and a rude awakening. Here,
upon the road to Foix was the witness
to the justice of that skepticism. The
silent cloaked horsemen, the untrod
den snow, the glittering peaks above,
towers and turrets in the gloom below,
helped her j Imagination In its new
alarm. She was sure that .danger
menaced her. Nothing could banish
that premonition â and stubborn in her
submission she began quickly but with
some composure to dress again. When
next she looked from the window, the
"barbican tower hid the men from her
sight. Esther bound up her hair, pinned
It loosely, and trying to tell herself
that she was foolish to be afraid, she
went to her bedroom door and opened
it. The narrow winding stair by which
she had ascended was in darkness now.
She distinguished voices â that of her
husband and, as she believed, of the
s?teward Martinezâ and somewhat re
assured by these she withdrew into her
room, and for a little while heard noth
ing but the sound of her . own Heart
beating.
had made her future possible. She
could not think hardly of Doctor Xa
vier, nor believe him to be her hus
band's enemy. She was so supremely
happy herself that she desired the hap
piness of others and of all who had be
friended her loneliness.
It was a chivalrous boast but vain,
Scarcely had he spoken the words
when anotherâ a wild hillman, drunk
and recklessâ pulled a dagger
from his girdle and drove it in the
youth's heart. He rolled neadlong, al
most to Esther's feet, and while his
life's blood gushed out upon the floor
she lost all consciousness and fell,
swooning, by his side.
She snatched her hand from the man
and, covering her face, shut out the
figure of the dead. It was not Arthur
but another who lay so still In the
shadows. Her relief was intense; she
turned to the men, Imploring their
pity.
"Where is my husband? â oh, in God's
name, take me to him!"
No one seemed very willing to an
swer this pitiful appeal, but when she
repeated it with tears in her eyes and
hands outstretched to them, a young
trooper stepped forward and said:
"By the Virgin, senorita, but I will
do what you want."
died down as suddenly, and silence,
profound and meaning, followed upon
the uproar. In the ebb of the storm
the messenger of death spoke clearly.
A body fell with a heavy thud, unmis
takable, dreadful to hear. Esther
could control herself no longer. She
ran wildly down the stairs and .broke
in upon the scene.
Twenty men were grouped about the
hearth in the great hall and the
swords of three of them were ' un
sheathed. Such, light as fell upon the
room shone upward from the redden
ing embers of the logs. Capricious
rays, they flashed out upon forbidding
faces and grim figures, leaving as in
the shadow of the grave the body of
a man who had fallen dead across the
table. Esther's silent tread had been
heard by none, but the cry which es
caped her lips when she entered the
hall brought every eye upon her and
sent the swords to the sheaths. A bur
ly man, fat and squat and threatening,
strode toward her without ceremony.
"Ah," he said in broken French, "you
save us the trouble, then, senorita!"
She shuddered at his touch, but her
courage did not leave her.
"Where is my husband?" she asked,
"what have you done with him?"
The man dragged her to the light
and laughed In bravado.
"The Prince sends his compliments,
senorita. He is called away. Yon fel
low had a message but i3 too lazy to
speak it. Come, we were waiting for
you. It is time to be going, senorita."
is bleak enough and I regard it merely
as a Ftage. If Gaudarez hurries, he
can let us have the news on the third
day. We shall then ride on to Oust
and if we have any luck we shoultl be
In the peiace within the week."
They dined at Orleans et half-past
fix. In the restaurant car there at
tached to the express. Day was Just
glimmering in the heavens when the
flrBt stage of that long Journey came to
its end; and stepping out upon a wide
platform, Esther knew that she was at
Foix.
"We shall find my servants here, and
the carriages," Arthur had said while
he helped her to the platform and
stacked their dressing-bags beside her.
"We must have some hot coffee and
then get on. I told them to put fur
rugs in the carriage and two of my
heavy coats. We'll make a soldier of
you, Esther; you won't complain of the
uniform when you get up into the
hills."
She was but half awake, and not a
little afraid of the strange eyes which
here Blared at her so curiously. Though
it was then a little after six o'clock
in the morning, quite a number of peo
ple had gathered upon the platform
at Foix to meet the express; and they
bustled hither and thither, shouting
end pushing and exchanging their ef
fusive greetings in a way quite char
acteristic of a southern race. Some of
them. Esther observed, were soldiers,
end these she disliked cordially, for
they stared her out of countenance, and
taking advantage of her husband's ab-
Eence, proffered an assistance entirely
unnecessary. She had feared that some
demonstration of welcome would have
awaited them at Foix, and it was not
without satisfaction that she found
herself Just an ordinary traveler
alighting at a country station and do-
Ing battle with the difficulties of a ter
minus. Arthur, however, was anxious
that she should not misunderstand
such apparent neglect, and he offered
her explanations over their hurried
meal.
"I knew you would feel tired; and,
besides, we are in a hurry," he said.
"These people would make speeches
for a month if we gave them any en
couragement. We shall have enough
of that sort of thing to go through
Â¦when we arrive at the palace. It is
a long drive from here and I don't
want my little girl to be dreadfully
tired. Come, drink up your coffee,
Esther; drink it while it Is hot. We
sha'n't get such a chance again until
we reach St. Girons."
When breakfast was done, he went
out to summon his servants, and Esth
er was left alone for a brief while In
the corridor of the station. She did
not know what instinct made her turn
suddenly, or why she should have
been conscious of some presence there
which was not friendly; but it chanced
that as Bhe turned, she perceived a
man almost at her elbow, and recog
nizing the bright dress and the white
bernouse of the Eastern, she saw. that
It was Yussuf, the Moor, Doctor Xav
ier's servant. For an Instant she be
held his keen piercing black eyes re
garding her ominously. Then he van
ished as mysteriously as he had come,
without word or sign, and almost be
fore she had- realized how greatly his
presence frightened her. Arthur found
her still flushed and agitated and it
was difficult to tell him exactly what
had happened.
"The Moor they call Yussuf, Dr.
Xavier'g servant â I have Just seen
him in the corridor!" Bhe stammered
a little wildly.
He laughed at her fears and instant
ly reassured her.
"Of course you would. He is going
to Cadi as we are. What are you
afraid of, Esther? What has the man
got to do with you?"
She could not tell him. She would
not say how much she feared the
omen.
In the courtyard of the station they
found an old fashioned barouche and
with it a fourgon for their luggage.
Esther noticed that the liveries of tha
men servants had once been showy,
but were now a little worn and faded.
The carriage itself suggested the
France of the empire, but the horses
were magnificent and what was more,
there were four of them.
"It is eight years since I was at Pt.
Girons," Arthur said, like one a lit
tle dubious about the reception awit
ing them in his house. "To be frank,
I have almost forgotten what the
place is like. The steward says that
it needs a fortune spending on it.
Most of these old castles in Spain do,
but as no one has a fortune they re
main uncared for. I have ordered the
housekeeper to light fires in every
room and to do the best she can."
He ran on, anxious to please her,
and pointed out many beautiful scenes
of that magnificent country.
. They reached the castle at 6 o'clock
that afternoon. For an hour at least
darkness had shut out those fantastic
pictures of gorge and height which the
long afternoon gave them so abundant
ly. Esther lay in her husband'8 arms
and lost all sense of time or place.
When she awoke he was lifting her
from the carriage, and the light of a
lantern flashed in her face. Night had
come down in earnest now; the wind
whistled dolefully through the caverns
of the hills, and Esther, but half awake,
believed at the first that some acci
dent had overtaken them. A moment
later, however, she perceived the nar
row windows of some building above
her, and could distinguish a cluster of
Epires and a great arched grate, through
which the barouche drove away. The
sound of strange voices, too, fell upon
her ears; and then, out of this bitter
night, she was carried swiftly to the
warmth and the light of some vast
room, and waking thoroughly she knew
that the Journey was ended and that
this was Arthur's home.
"Come," he said gayly, brushing the
snowflakes off his coat, and holding
hla hands to the ruddy blaze, "come
They dined alone in the great hall,
the old steward, Martinez, waiting
upon them. When dinner was done.
Arthur showed her a prettier room,
furnished in the fashion of France,
with Louis XV ornaments and an old
piano, which, like all old pianos, had
once been the property of Chopin.
Here for an hour she played to him
and then at his bidding (for her fa
tigue was unmistakable) she followed
an old woman of the house up a nar
row stairway to her bedroom and was
left for the time being alone. That
sense of homeliness she had discov r
ered below was not lacking upstairs,
despite walls of white stone and win
dows which recalled the years of
chivalry. Blazing logs upon an open
hearth suffused a gentle warmth and
cast their welcome glow upon the high
groaned ceiling. The bed was cur
tained with dimity, white and spotless.
Many candles stood upon a wide dress
ing table; there were even fresh roses
from the valleys in vases of Sevres.
From the windows, which were but
little more than loopholes in tremen
dous -walls of stone, a vista of the pass
could be seen and the road by which
they had come up to the castle.
The night fell calm and still and
the wailing wind had ceased. A moon,
waxing full and enshrouded in golden
mist, rose up between two frowning
peaks and pointed the untrodden snow
with gems of fire. The sky Itself was
luminously blue and altogether bereft
of cloud. Esther perceived that the
castle stood upon a spur of rock and
thence thrust out its Moorish gables
above an immense ab^ss. The road
to Foix resembled nothing so much
â¢â¢is a winding stairway, zigzagging
from peak to peak and oft so narrow
that she wondered a carriage might
follow it safely. Vivid as her im
pressions were of the country to
which the day had introduced her, this
moonlight scene surpassed all the
grandeur of its changing shapes and
the variety of its weird defiles. Mighty
precipices abounded there at the
height of the pass. Black basins of
rock, prodigiously deep and surmount
ed by spires and pinnacles which evil
spirits might have shaped, suggested
a nether world, unknown and pro
foundly mvsterious. The snow caps
themselves won beauty of the moon
light; some of them were but^ rounded
domes, gentle to the eye and pleasing;
others, Jagged and twisted, leaned at
such odd angles and were so tilted
from the perpendicular that you might
have thought a touch of the hand
would have sent them headlong into
the valleys below.
Ksther found this scene of gorge and
crag so alluring that she .delayed un
dressing for many minutes to enjoy it.
She was alone In the room and none
troubled her. Her maid, Suzanne, -was
to follow them from Paris to-morrow â
the willing housekeeper spoke Spanish
with amazing volubility, but had no
other tongue. Esther was very pleased
when the old woman went about her
business and left her to herself. She
had never been a lover of strange faces
and at such an hour she did not desire
them at all. If amid the natural ex
citement of that night her thoughts
passed in any way from her present
occupations it was to remind her how
far she had journeyed from England
and in what circumstances of Isolation
and dependence. Arthur's love meant
so much to her In this lonely house.
She clung to it as to something which
would safeguard her wherever they
might be and sooner or later would
carry her back to the world again. If
she had ever questioned the meaning
of her love this night answered her
finally. She was naturally a girl of
great courage, but she Joined to this
a disposition to rely both upon the
fidelity f nd the affection of the friend
she trusted. This gaunt castle, so si
lent, bo remote, asked of her those
qualities of mind and heart which were
most characteristic of her girlhood.
She had changed her dress when first
she entered the room, and put on a
rose-pink dressing-gown in Its place,
allowing her abundant hair to fall
upon her pretty shoulders and trying to
feel at her ease. The glass showed her
. a rosy face and arms and shoulders
superbly white. If her thoughts wan
dered from the entrancing Â¦ present it
was to remind her of the hand which
had showered these gifts upon her and
-
and warm yourself, little wife! You
are really at St. Gironsâ you are home
at last!"
She loosened her cloak and bent
toward the flaming logs. The room in
which they sat was Ill-lighted enough,
but she could see something of its im
mensity and of that strange melange
of riches and poverty it displayed. The
chimney-piece, she thought, must be
the largest In the world. You could
have roasted an ox upon Its hearth,
and high above the ingle bizarre figures
carved in Jet black oak, lifted a bald
achlno to the very ceiling. A buffet,
just as odd, matched this giant chim
ney-piece. The walls were hung with
torn and tattered tapestry. Chairs and
tables of oak might have been hacked
by the swords of an army.
There was no carpet on the floor,
but the candlesticks were of pure sil
ver and worthy a king's house. Es
ther's first impression of this room
was of Its homeliness in spite of all.
The weird scenes she had quitted in
the mountains had left her a little
awed and afraid.* She was like ona
who had found a haven from the
night. It was all shut out now â all
behind her; these amazing walls were
her defense. Her lover stood beside
her; the blazing fire brought the blood
back to her stiffened limbs.
"I nm sure that I shall like it, Ar
thur," she exclaimed upon an Impulse
of her gratitude. "How kind you are
to me! Imagine being alone on that
dreadful road! I shall never let you
out of my sight while I am here!"
He knelt beside her and took both
her hands In his own.
"Never!" he said, "it is a promise
â never until my life's end."
CHAPTER XIII. S
A fresh wind of dawn blowing coldly
upon her face awoke Esther from her
dream-like swoon. She opened her
eyes and became aware that the sun
was shining upon her face and that the
night had passed. Anon, her situation
shaped more clearly, and she under
stood that she was strapped upon a
horse's back and that the animal's un
certain step rocked her as in the rudest
cradle. She^was very 111 and her brain
burned, defying all clear thought. If
she remembered anything of yesterday,
it was at first indistinctly as something
which she would Veil forget. One by
one, 'however, events shaped them
selves. She recalled Her arrival at
Foix, the scene at the station, the drive
through the hills, the silent gorge, the
castle perched upon the height. She
dwelt upon Arthur's passionate tender
ness when they were together at their
journey's end. She recalled her mus
ings in the bedroom, the picture of the
snow-bound road, and then, as in a"
flash, the whole story of the tragedy!
Her despair at such a moment was be
yond words to describe. She knew not
whence the outrage h<m come, or why.
At one time she was willing to think
that these men. were brigands of the
hills rtho would carry her to their hid
ing-places, where she might expect a
worse fate than death. But this
thought she quickly rejected. No mere
hill thief would venture an attack upon
her husband's house. She must find
her answer 'in a subtler plan, nor could
she separate her misfortunes from the
story of Arthur's kingdom 'and^of his
months of exile. He himself had
warned her that all might not be as
he would wish it. This hour of crisis
was the Justification of his doubts.
She suffered terribly from the cold,
though they had wrapped fur coats
about her and even covered her face
with a woolen shawl. The bonds
which bound her to the saddle were
cruelly tight and left her hands and
feet white and bloodless. She could
have cried for very pain of it, and yet
suffered in silence. That many accom
panied her upon this strange Journey
the circumstances of the hour denied.
From time to time she heard a harsh
voice encouraging a horse or cursing a
loiterer, but the voice was never an
swered and it ended always in guttural
self-approval. The road itself told her
nothing. She perceived a mighty wall
of rock upon her left, rising sheer, as
it were, to the very heavens. Her eyes
could not fathom the abyss below and
she understood that they were upon
the ledge of a precipice, descending to
the valley's heart. Thus, for a full
hour, she endured her torture with a
woman's unbroken courage. They
could kill her, she said. She would be
content to die if she knew that Arthur
lived.
The cortege, if such it might be
called, halted at last; and for the first
time Esther beheld the face of one of
her captors. This man she recognized
at once for the burly ruffian who led
the troop last night. His uniform was
blue, with metal buttons. He wore an
odd-shaped busby and parried an an
| cient sword at his belt. As last nightj
bo now, his air of self-im,portance was
tremendous, and not less ridiculous
than the French tongue he delighted to
misuse.
"So," he said, crying out in mock sur
prise, "her Highness is awake! Come
here, Pablo, come and help me to pay
my respects."
He lumbered from his horse and
tugged clumsily at the ropes which
was excusing himself as best he could;
but he had not uttered^ many words
when some one snatched the whip from
his hand and beat him unmercifully.
Esther saw the blood running from his
face while he groveled upon his knees
before a burly trooper; she beheld the
remaining bandits flying wildly to the
hills; then some one spoke to her. and
she burst into a flood of tears.
"Good God, mademoiselle! what does
this meanâ who are you? How did you
come to this place?"
She raised her eyes, and found her
self face to face with a man of fine
presence, and apparently of some 30
years of age. He wore the uniform of
a regiment of hussars, bright blue in
color and heavily laced with gold.
Â» "Do not be afraid, I beg of you," he
said. "I am the Count of Foix; these
are my men. You have nothing to fear
from them."
She dried her tears and answered him
quite frankly:
"My home is at St. Gironsâ I arrived i
there from Paris yesterday â if you j
could send a message there, my hus- \
band would be very grateful to you." i
HeÂ« turned and called a trooper to I
him. Nothing was easier than to do as f
she asked. '
"You are staying with the Prince,
then, madame?" he asked.
"I am his wife," she said.
The Count regarded her with a look
expressing both amazement and incre
dulity.
"The wife of my Prince, madame! â {
impossible! This Is his own regiment, j
Please do not Jest with me. I am one
of his Highness* oldest friends."
"Sir," she said, "I would ask you if
any one In my circumstances would
wish to Jest. If you doubt me send to
St. Girons at once. I do not know
whether my husband Is alive or dead.
You can understand what I suffer."
He did not seem to hear her; his hes
itation was not to be disguised. Some
of the hussars, by this time, had dis
mounted from their horses and they
held them In a circle about the inn
door. The landlady had gone flying
into the house at the first word spoken.
The bandit, Alonzo, hung limp and
dead above the moaning cascade. They
hanged him without pity from a branch
of the oak In the garden of the inn.
When the Count next spoke, he gave
an order which sent six of the troopers
at the gallop toward St. Girons.
"Let me have tidings before sunset.
The Prince Is to know that I have rid
den to the frontier with this lady. If
you find any stranger in the castle,
hang him without question; say that
the Comte de Foix Is your authority.
You others, get a litter ready. Madame
cannot walk. Let a file go to Merens
and prepare breakfast. We shall be
there in an hour."
She sipped the spirit and It stimu
lated her courage; remembering that
the greater danger had passed, she
begged to be taken to St. Girons.
"If you will allow one of your men to
accompany me, I am sure I can rids
there," she pleaded. "It cannot be very
far from here, Count. I am well
enough for that."
The Count shook his head. His man
ner was kindly; but he was plainly ob
durate.
"By no means well enough," he said;
"you forget that one hour's Journey
down the pass will be three hours
up. It Is a hard and difficult road
which a stranger follows at his peril.
Besides, we shall ascertain at Merens
what are the Prince's wishes. I Im
agine he will say that I have done well
and that I am to take you to Cadi
without loss of time."
"You do not consider my anxiety."
she protested. "Will you not think of
that? I cannot bear the suspense!"
"Your anxiety is unnecessary," he re
plied, suavely. "I have no doubt what
ever of the Prince's safety. These men <
are vulgar thieves. They will scatter j
directly a troop appears in the hills. I
imagine they were In Ignorance that
the Prince was at St. Girons. They
certainly have not courage enough to
do him an Injury!"
With this and similar assurances he
did his best to persuade her. She
thought it a little odd that he had
never once spoken of her marriage or
appeared to recognize It. He addressed
her as a stranger, it may be as one
who had 'shared the hospitality of St.
Girons; but of her act and its conse
quences he was careful not to speak.
"In any case we shall not be long in
doubt," he said; "my men have definite
instructions and will obey them to the
letter. If you feel equal to it, we will
now go on to Merens; I am sure it is
the wiser course, madame."
It was plain to her that he would In
sist upon it, and the futility of further
protest being evident, she gave her re
luctant consent and thanked him for
his solicitude. Troopers had. by this
time, contrived a rude Utter of poles
and sheeting and in this way they car
ried her from the innâfor she was far
too weak to walk, and even the most
trifling exertion caused her an effort.
Esther wondered, in spite o'f all, if any
English girl had ever crossed the
mountains in such a fashionâ escorted
by a hundred Spanish hussars who had
snatched her from insult or from
death. The troopers' Jangling arms,
the bugle's deep note, the tossing
plumes, the capering: horses, suggested
some wild pageant of the hills which no
story book surpassed. Her imagina
tion would have delighted in such a
spectacle but for that vivid doubt
which followed every step and ha
rassed her unpltylngly. "Was Arthur
alive? When and where would he come
to her? Had her love dream ended for
ever? She knew not. Some crisis of her
fate had overtaken her. and the future
lay in God's hands. Esther, troubled
in her new security, lay back upon the
pillow and let the sunshine fall upon
her tired face. In the end she slept,
and in her sleep she heard her lover's
voice.
bound her. She was so faint and
bloodless that she could scarcely stand
when her feet touched the ground; the
touch of the man's hand was loathsome
to her and she drew away from him,
clinging to the horse. "Please leave
me," she exclaimed, "please leave me
alone. I do not wanÂ£ your help."
He laughed loudly, and breaking In
to Spanish, addressed her in a long
speech of which she could not under
stand a single word. "When he remem
bered his broken French again It was
to excuse himself upon a pretense of
necessity, but with the air of one who
would say, "I do what I please!"
"The ropes were tight? yes, would
you fall down the mountain? I, Alonzo,
I make it my business to save your life.
You are cold, but the wine will warm
you. Here is the posada of Vic-Des
sos. We shall eat and drink, senorita â
aye, can you eat and drink? "Well, I
can, if you will not!"
The sunshine and the softer air of the
valley brought the blood back to Es
ther's tingling limbs, and although she
felt very sick and giddy and her heart
sank at every word, she did not answer
the man nor again appeal to his pity.
The place f they had come to was a little
grassy knoll above the bed of a moun
tain cascade. Here was a rude inn
built of planks. Peasants sat at a little
table beneath the shelter of a clump of
pines. The valley itself spread out far
and wide upon her left hand, disclosing
a pleasing scene of field and pasture
and nestling villages. New that she
could count the number of her escort,
she perceived that the company was
fiv^e in ail, and that one of them was
the man who had struck her befriender
down last night. Not a shred of ro
mance could she now permit these
roving bandits. The less kindly sun
light declared many a rent In their tat
tered uniforms and showed their accou
terment as but a metal sham. They
were indescribably dirty, ferocious in
mein and obviously drunken. "Whither
they were taking her or to what enu
she knew no more than the dead. Wild
stories of the Pyrenees and its moun
tain bands had been told her often in
Doctor Xavier's houss. She believed
that her story was the simplestâ she
had fallen into the hands of the hillmen
and would be lucky to escape them
with her life.
They led her to a seat before the inn
door and there left her to rest her
weary limbs. A â¢ Spanish woman, fat
but net unkindly, set a bottle of harsh
wine before hfr and a mess of kid's
flesh from which she turned with
loathing. Her escort, meanwhile,
drank deeply and quarreled no less lib
erally. The leader himself, the man
they named Alonzo, appeared to Es
ther to have a genius for long speeches
which was altogether remarkable.
From time to time he addressed her as
though she had been an audience of ten
thousand, in a tongue entirely foreign
to her and with an emphasis absolute
ly unnecessary. His fellows, mean
Â¦whlle, played a game with greasy cards
and pointed their remarks from time to
time with a fine display of Spanish
knives. The Intruding peasants, taking
in the situation at a glance, went off
one by one, and left the robbers in
possession of the inn. No scene of con
trasts more picturesque could have
been discovered or imagined. Yonder
on the heights was the glory and the
solitude of sternest winter; here in the
valley the murmur of streams, the
rustling of leaves, the pasture land,
the first fruits of a southern spring.
When the bellowing voice permitted
her to hear it, Esther was conscious of
that buzz of Insect life which ever fol
lows abundant sunshine. Tha cascade,
leaping down from bowlder to bowlder,
gave a weird music whose note was
plaintive and not a little melancholy.
Esther's brave demeanor both per
plexed and angered the leader of the
band. He had sent the landlord hither,
thither, in quest of such meager enter
tainment as the inn could afford; and
when Esther would do no more than
sip her wine, and turn sick and faint
from the mess of food they offered her,
he was alternately threatening and
persuasive.
"Ah," he said, " we must teach you
to be obedient, senorita. You wish to
frighten us. Look at me, Alonzo Dela
razâam I one to be afraid? By the
Virgin of Cadi, I am not frightened at
all! Here is a little whip, senorita. If
you make me, I shall know how to use
it. Observe my features; do you de-,
tect any weakness there? Holy Image!
I have known some obstinate females
in my time. It is like a woman to die
for spite â but you shall not die, not just
yet, senorita, eo please to eat. Do not
compel me to forget myself."
She did not look at him, did not say
a word. He carried a riding-whip in
his hand and he gripped the leather of
it tightly, while with the other hand he
pushed the dish toward her.
"Do you hear?" he repeated, "I am
ordering you to eat!"
Again she did not answer, did not
make a movement. Chagrined at her
obstinacy, he caught her by the wrist
and raised his whip suddenly.
"None of your fine airs here!" he ex
claimed with the bully's delight at her
helplessness. "Will you eat that meat
or will you not?"
She believed that he would strike her,
and she did not shrink from the blow.
The others applauded him, crying,
"Well done, old Alonzo!" The woman
of the posada stood with folded arms
â¢watching the scene indifferently. The
question had been put for the third
time; Esther believed that nothing
could save her from this terrible igno
miny of a blow; when, without any
warning, a loud clatter of "hoofs was
heard upon the path, and before any
man could stir hand or foot a troop of
cavalry swept down-' the defile and
reined back In a dramatic halt at the
very door of the inn. For an Instant
Esther did not know whether the new
comers were friends or foes. She per
ceived many bright blue uniforms and
heard an officer talking angrily. Then
she understood that the ruffian Alonzo

Weale believes that ideas have sped

the once Impending doom of the Anglo-

the Japanese coming to the rescue.
The rightful future of Manchuria Is to

There Is a good summarizing of Man

regard to the Manchus, of whom we
have heard so much, it is interesting to
note that they rose to supreme power
in the Orient because they were nerved
to conquering, courage by a Chinese
treachery done centuries ago. The first
great Manchu was Nurhachu, of the
sixteenth century. His sire and grand
sire were slain by connivance of the
Chinese authorities. Nurhachu swore
he would sacrifice 200.000 Chinese In
honor of his father's funeral. He be
queathed the feud to his sons' sons, un
til the race grew strong by warlike re-
Eltance. A time came when the Chi
nese imperial troops, unable to cope
with their bandit rebels at home, made
an alliance with their old enemies, the
Manchus, to help down the bandits.
Dorgun, the Manchu regent, did it!
When the deed was done the Chinese
politely thanked the Manchus with a

In the "Prologue to the Crisis" occurs
this prophecy: "The cutting of the first
sod of the great Siberian railway by
the Czarewitch in 1S31 near Vladivostok
was really the official opening of a
question which may yet make Russia
bleed to death." Further on in the
book the Russians' attempted "con
quest by railway" Is well told and the
reason for its futility pointed out. It is
a too costly, too thin Russian string
through a wilderness that cannot be
Russianized. Chinese cunning, Chinese
preponderance, Chinese deadly cheap
competition, even just Chinese "vis in
ertiae." make the plan Impossible.
The author gives a good account of
the uselessness of the Russian financial
scheme which was to assist the "con
quest by railway." He calls it "the
traveling ruble." The Chinese redeem
the Russian rubles instanter and the
swift cashing process cancels all hoped
for outreach of power by credit or Rus
sianizing of Manchu millions by fixing
on them a Slav financial system. The
ruble travels so rapidly its nimbleness
makes it non-effective, and spot coin
might as well be paid for the goods, or
so soon after for the suspected paper.
The light thrown on the corruption of
Russian methods of doing businessâ the
bribery, the bare-faced demands by of
ficials for percentages on contracts â
show good reasons for Russian failure

of an American firm losing many

count of a lavishly projected church at

This brings us to think of one of the
most puzzling features of the great
struggle for supremacy In the Far
East. Is the triumph of the cross of
Christ much concerned In the matter?
Are the Japanese, by outdoing the Rus
sians in practical righteousness, really
more Christian than those who name
the Name in prayer and bow to the
symbol of the cross? Will the victory
of the Japanese be a -setting back of
the advance of Christianity, or but, by
checking the Slav, make swifter way

sult of this conversion of politics from

eration of machines.

right to vote is our hope of salvation.
Are these deductions logical, fol

the spirit of this revolutionary docu
ment, ivas not a government deriving
Its powers from the consent of the gov
erned. So much is theoretically correct,
is recognized by theorists, but when In
the face cf this conclusion the author
'makes the assertion that for a perfect
example of unrestricted government by
!the people we should turn to the rule
- of the committee of public safety In the
French Revolution, one Is at a loss to
â¢know what conception he holds cf ideal

Acceptlr^f the fact, then, that our
Government in its earliest practical
operation was far from the ideal, the
author proceeds to show the influences
-which have arisen to carry it farther
Vr from the consent of the governed.
.In the spirit of these utterances our
'-constitution v.as framed; it vouchsafed
an ideal republicanism. But, says the
. author, "coercion is inseparable from

the government built upon the consti

Jupiter therein. He finds the second
equally as startling; how Nova Zem

sea aquarium. The third chapter,
even, keeps up the strain with promo
tion schemes such as the world never

snaps, drops down to something below
mediocrity and trails away to the

BOOKS AND THEIR WRITERS
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
5THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU.
DEAR, UNCLE SILAS: I have been here in New Yorfc
several days without writing to you and feel reproaehec
for my neglect ; yet I recall that you told me not tc
write until I had enjoyed some adventures worth re
porting, and that you whimsically offered to wager me a
thousand shares of sugar stock that I would have many such ad
ventures. I am stopping at the hotel you recommended, and
while its comforts are all that you pictured them, from your own
experience, its cxpensiveness is a constant source of surprise, and
would be embarrassing were it not that my holdings in the beet
sugar refinery afford me justification for liberal living. Â«
The hotel is conducted quite unlike the inn at Beetvillc, and
while it \yas a surprise not to find a central stove around Avhicli
gentlemen gather after tea to discuss the price of beets and tin
tariff on sugar, the greatest surprise was that Â¦ my first breakfasi
cost $3 95, and was no more plentiful than the breakfast our im
serves for half a dollar. But .with such differences between home
and here you are, of course, familiar, for I find that you are wcli
known at the hotel, and liked, too, by the hired men' who some
times refer to you as "a dead game sp->rt," whatever that ma\
signify. I had been here a couple of day's and was lonely, because
New Yorkers seem indisposed to make acquaintance without the
formality of an introduction, and several 1 spoke to rudely stared
at me and passed on their ways without replying â except oik
who threatened to call the police if 1 tried any confidence game
on him. I wonder what he meant. Â¦';
In this lonely state 1 was pleased to have- a gentleman ap
proach me in the burying ground of Trinity Church, .where 1 was
enjoying the melancholy pleasure of finding the tombstones ovei
the last resting places of many great and distinguished men, sucli
as Alexander Hamilton, and say to me (the gentleman who ap
proached, not Hamilton, said) that he made it his patriotic duty al
ways on visiting New York to do as I was doing â pay his debt oi
respect to the country's great -men. "But,"' he added, "to pay. anv
kind of a debt amounts to a passion with me."
I was pleased to meet a gentleman of. so honorable principles,
and pleased at the opportunity of entering into conversation, foi
1 am fond of my fellow citizens, and had scarcely spoken to : . an
equal since my arrival. I had no sooner told him that I was from
Beetville and a large owner in the refinery, and that you were
president of the Beet Sugar Refinery and Bank", than he expressed
the greatest astonishment and interest, for, as it happened, lie is
quite well acquainted with you, having met you at the Beet Sugai
Growers' Convention, which I told him you had attended.
While he turned out a most affable' acquaintance, he was
somewhat eccentric, for he abruptly remarked on the charm of the
weather. I wittily replied that it rnijjht be charming for those
fond of cloudy skies, unseasonable cold and a drizzle, and then
after laughing pleasantly at my bright sally, he confided to me thai
he had just had a bit of good luck which made him careless of the
weather. Naturally I asked him to explain, but he was loth tc
do so. At last he admitted that while he disapproved of all man
ner of gambling, he had, more in a spirit of sport than greed,
taken a chance in a lottery and won a large prize.
He explained that a censor of morals here, a person named
Jerome, was opposed to lotteries, so they were conducted with
great secrecy ; that, to collect his prize, he was waiting there foi
the agent of the lottery, who was to take him to the cashier's
office. Truly, as he spoke a businesslike man came up, to whom
my amiable friend showed his ticket, which the agent examined
and pronounced to be the winner of the thousand-dollar prize. He
proposed that they should go at once to the office and have it
cashed, but my friend said, with evident disappointment, that he
could not go at that time, for he had an important engagement
uptown, for which he must hurry.
He asked me if I would be kind enough to go with the agent
and collect the prize for him..' I was naturally flattered at this trust
in me displayed by one I had just met and readily agreed to do
as he asked. He indorsed the ticket over to me in business form,
and then suggested that as a further matter of mere form I should
advance him $250 on it until we met in the evening. I would
willingly have advanced the sum he asked, if for no other rea
son than that he liked you so much, but I had only $100 with me.
My friend seemed disappointed for a second, but them said
cheerfully that he would accept the sum, as it was a mere form to
show that the transaction was on a business basis, strictly; and
he took the $100 so willingly that I was touched to realize "how
much confidence I inspire even on short acquaintance.
He hurried off to catch an elevated train, after appointing a
meeting at my hotel in the evening. The agent of the lottery po
litely asked me to have a bottle of pop in a nearby place of re-
freshment, so we went to a resort on the opposite side of the street,
which is in a basement, but Ls an establishment of vast size and
magnificence, with many entrances and spacious rooms.
We were no sooner entered than the agent chanced to see Mr.
Russell Sage leaving by another door, and excused himself to
speak to* the noted .- financier. Their business must have been
highly important, for the agent did not return, though [ waited for
linn until an employe said it was closing time and asked me if I
would retire and give the scrub woman a chance. He laughed a
meaningless laugh when I explained why I had tarried so long,
and said "Sec Jerome or McClusky."
/. M H \( orm P r M tnc -.L-cnsor : of morals I have alreadv mentioned,
and' with whom, naturally, I could fiave impossible business. Who
AJcCmsky is 1 do not know.
I was distressed toj'havc to return-uptown without having col
lected my friend's prize, but as' if turned out my distress was need
less^ for my friend neglected to keep - his" appointment with me;
detained, I concluded, by his important business. Waiting as
long as I deemed necessary, I left a note at the office against
the. chance of my friend coming, and then I strolled out into the
mam street, which has many features of life it seems proper I
should investigate as a lesson in my sociological studies.
1 had/ walked but a few squares up the brilliantly lighted
street when I was accosted by a man who inquired where he
could get change for a fifty-dollar bill. He was a stranger from
the West, he, said, and' just met a man to whom he owed a
small sum of money, which he wished to pay!
I was glad, to accommodate a stranger like myself, but the
occurrences of the day suggested to .me that the transaction be
undertaken and completed in the presence of all parties involved.
The stranger agreed aiul led the way to the private room of one
of the splendid palaces lining the street^ and there, to my delight,
presently came the gentleman I met in the churchyard. To my
astonishment he seemed shocked to see me and .started to leave
the room with precipitate haste. I am a young man of more than
ordinary keenness of wit, for when I savv the undue haste of my
agreeable acquaintance it suddenly dawned upon me that it was
owing to some mental trouble that lie had not, kept his appoint
ment with .me; that he would be an easy victim of designing per
sons, and it was my duty to protect him. So I forcibly detained
him and gently asked him why he had not kept his engagement.
My fears for his condition were at once justified ; he answered
that he had never seen me before, and even denied that he had re
ceived $ioo froin me. I pitied him. I considered but a moment
what to do, for my mind works rapidly and accurately, and I said
to him: "Sir, you are suffering from the effects of city excitement;
it is my duty to keep you from designing persons."
The keen insight I thus displayed caused both the others to
laugh heartily, and it was some moments before they could do more
than utter unintelligible things about it being a pity to "do" so
easy a thing, the meanness of taking candy from a child and other
remarks not germane to the occasion of our encounter. So I stead
ily insisted upon my plan and led my friend out into the high
way, and there finding a policeman briefly related to him the in
cidents of my acquaintance with ,my companion and asked that he
be taken care of. The policeman looked dazed for a minute and
then said, in a threatening tone:
"If you make me lock up this gentleman I'll take you along,
too, and you'll be detained as a witness; you'll be in the papers;
Jerome will lecture you ; your picture will be in the Rogues' Gal
lery ; the Grand Jury will indict you for feloniously playing against
the peace of the little old island of Manhattan, and McAdoo,
he'll "
I interrupted the talkative officer to ask him if he refused to
take .care of the unfortunate gentleman, and then he looked more
dazed, but at last said: "Sure, if that's all you want, I'll take care
of him, if you'll make a hurry sneak back to your hotel and sav
nothing." _ . J
I walked away, pondering on my friend's unfortunate plight
and so deeply did I ponder that I must have walked in a circle'
for presently I came upon him again, talking and laughing with
the policeman. They did not see me, but I overheard my friend
say, as- he gave the officer a ten-dollar bill, "The trick was so
easy for you to turn it is not worth more than this."
I hope he will recover his mind enough to call for his lottery
ticket soon, for I dislike to have so valuable a collateral for such
a smallloan. As you know him so well, tell me something
about him. Have I mentioned that his name is Mortimore Mont
morency? So his card reads, though I overheard" the officer call
him "Joe" â "Hungry Joe," I think he said.
Affectionately, your nephew, REUBEN.
P. S. â I was taking this letter to the post box when the hotel
detective accosted me and said he had seen me conversing on the
street with a man he must warn me to avoid, a noted bunko man.
When I asked him what a bunko man was he looked at me so
wearily that I realized how fatigued he must be. . After I had
told .him my story he said that I had loaned the one hundred dol
lars to one no better than a swindler. When I proudly showed
him the lottery ticket I held as security his look of weariness deep
ened, and he said, "If you won't take my word go to the hotel of
fice and ask what that ticket is worth."
I am treated with great respect at the office, owing to the ex
cellent reputation you have established here, still I thought the
clerk's manner was not altogether polite as he looked at the ticket
and then at me. All he said was, "This is worthless." Of course
I regret the loss of so considerable a sum, still I feel that it may
not be a loss after all, for when my friend recovers his mind I be
lieve he will repay me, as I am convinced that he was an innocent
purchaser of this worthless thing â being a friend of yours.
I think of going to Coney Island, the races and other places
of innocent amusement, and will write you any experiences which
may be of interest. ' R.
RUBEN FROM BEERVILLE
6DAWN O' DAY - IN THE BIG CITIES
The owner of the cauliflower is stung; she points the beauties of
that cauliflower. Apparently it is the cauliflower out of all her
stock that she loves best ; a better cauliflower never lived ; if there
were more cauliflowers things might be different. She gives a
sketch of the cauliflower's career from its youth upward. Hard
enough it will be for her when the hour for parting from it comes.
If the other lady has not sufficient knowledge of cauliflowers to ap
preciate it will she kindly not paw it about, but put it down and
go away and never let the owner of the cauliflower see her again?
The other lady, more as a friend than a purchaser, points out the
cauliflower's defects. She wishes well to the owner of the cauli
flower and would like to teach her something about her business.
A lady who thinks such a cauliflower worth six sous can never
hope to succeed as a cauliflower vendor. Has she really taken the
trouble to examine the cauliflower for herself or has love made her
blind to its shortcomings? The owner of the cauliflower is too
indignant to reply. She snatches it away, appears to be comfort
ing it,. replaces it in the basket. The other lady is grieved at hu
man obstinacy- and stupidity in general. If the owner of the cauli
flower had had any sense she would have asked four sous. Even
tually business is done at five. It is the custom everywhere abroad
âasking the price of a thing is simply opening the conversation.
A lady told me that the first day she began housekeeping in Flor
ence she handed over to a poulterer for a chicken the price he had ,
demanded with protestations that he was losing by the transaction *
but wanted for family reasons apparently to get rid of the chicken.
He stoodfor half a minute staring at her and then, being an honest
sort of man, threw in a pigeon. Foreign housekeepers starting
business- in London appear hurt when our tradesmen decline to ac
cept half a crown for articles marked three and six. Then why
market only three .and sixpence? is their argument.
makes a charming picture on a summer morning, the great cathe
dral with its massive shadow forming the background; splashed
about its feet,' like a parterre of gay ilowcrs around the' trunk of
some old tree, the wemen, young giris, in. their many colored cos
tumes, sitting before their piled up baskets cf green vegetables, of
brilliant fruit. In Brussels the chief market is held onÂ°the Grand
place; the great gilded houses have looked down upon' much the
same scene every morning- these four hundred years. In- summer
time it commences about half-past 4 ; . by 5 o'clock it is a roaring
hive, the great city round about still sleeping*. Here comes the
thrifty housewife of the poor, to whom the difference of the tenth
of a penny in the price of a cabbage is all important, the
much harassed keeper of the petty pension. There are houses in
Brussels where they will feed you,,light you, sleep you, wait on you,
for two francs a day. Withered' old ladies, ancient governesses,
vvho will teach you for forty centimes an hour, gather round these
rickety tables, wolf up the thin soup, grumble at the watery, cof
fee, help themselves with unladylike greediness to the potato pie.
It needs careful housekeeping to keep these poor creatures on two
francs a day and make a profit for yourself. So "Madame," the
much-grumbled-at, who has gone to bed about 12, rises a little be
fore 5, makes her way down with her basket. Thus a few sous may
be saved, upon the day's economies. ' They are Babel of
bargaining, these markets. The purchaser selects, a cauli
flower â fortunately the cauliflower has no feelings, or probably it
would burst into tears at the expression with which it rs. regarded.
It is impossible that any lady should desire such a' cauliflower.; still,
out of curiosity, she would know the priceâ that is, if the owner
of the cauliflower is not too much ashamed of it to. name a price.
The owner of the cauliflower suggests six sous. The thing is too
ridiculous for argument; the other lady" breaks into a laugh.
There is a statue of Aphrodite in one of the smaller . Paris
parks. Twice in the same week," without particularly meaning it,
I found myself early in the inorning standing in front of the statue
gating listlessly, as one does when in dreamy mood " v and on both
occasions, turning to go, I encountered the same man, also gazing
at it with apparently listless eyes. He was an uninteresting look
ing man â possibly he thought the same of me. From his dress he
might have been a well-to-do tradesman, a minor Government offi
cial, doctor or lawyer. Quite ten years later I paid my third visit
tu the same statue at about the same hour. This time he was
there before me. I was hidden from him by some bushes. He
glanced round, but did not see me ; and then he did a curious thing.
Placing his hands on the top of the pedestal, which â¢ may have
been some seven feet in height, he drew himself up till his lips
were on a level and kissed very gently, almost reverentially, the
foot of the statue, begrimed though it was with the city's dirt. Had
he been some long-haired student of the Latin Quarter one would
not have been so astonished. But he was such a very commonplace
quite respectable-looking man. Afterward he drew a pipe from his
pocket, carefully filled and lighted it, took his. umbrella from the
seat where it had been lying and walked away. Had it been their
meeting-place long ago? Had he been wont to tell her, gazing at
her with lover's eyes, how like she was to the statue? The French
sculptor has not to consider Mrs. Grundy. Maybe the ladyi rais
ing her eyes, had been confused, perhaps for a moment angry
some little milliner or governess, one supposes. 'Â¦' In France the
jeune fille of good family does not' meet her lover unattended.
What had happened? Or was it but the vagrant fancy of a
middle-aged bourgeois seeking in imagination the romance that
reality so rarely gives us, weaving his love-dream roundthis change
less statue? In one of Ibsen's bitter comedies the lovers agree to
.part while they are still young, never to see each other in the
flesh again. Into the future each will bear away the image of the
other, god-like, radiant with the glory of youth and love; each
will cherish the memory of a loved one who shall be beautiful al
ways. That their parting may not appear such wild nonsense as it
first strikes us, Ibsen shows us the lovers who have married in the
usiial orthodox fashion. She was ail a mistress should be. They
speak of her as they first knew hsr fifteen years ago, when every
man was at her feet. He, then a young student, burning with fine
ideals, with enthusiasm for all the humanities. They enter. What
did you expect? Fifteen years have passed away; fifteen vears
of strugggle with the grim realities. He is fat, growing "bald.
Eleven children have to be provided for. High ideals will not even
pay the bootmaker. To exist you have to fight for mean ends with
mean weapons. And the sweet girl heroine, the worried mother of
eleven brats ! One rings the curtain amid satanic laughter. That
:s why, for one reason among so many, I love this mystic morning
light. It has strange power of revealing the beauty that is hidden
from us by the coarse beams of the full day. These worn men and
women, grown so foolish looking, so unromanticâ these artisans
and pretty clerks plodding to their monotonous day's work ; these
dull-eyed women of the people on their way tcf market to haggle
over sons, to argue and contend over paltry handfuls of food. In
this magic morning light the disguising body becomes transparent.
They have grown beautiful, not ugly, with the years of toil and
hardship; these lives lived so patiently are consecrated to the
service of the world. Joy, hope, pleasure â they have done with
all such ; life for them is over, yet they labor, ceaselessly, uncom
plainingly. It is for the children.
It is curious the attraction that a church has always possessed
for the marketing classes. Christ drove them from the Temple,
but still in every Continental city they cluster round its walls. It
' Â¦ J
jests, its vile gossip. A pair of lovers cross the park, holding each
other's hands. They will return this same way later in the day,
but there will be another expression in their eyes, another meaning
in the pressure of their hands. Now the purity of the morning is
with them. Some fat, middle-aged clerk comes puffing into view;
his ridiculous little figure very podgy. He stops to take off his hat
and mop his bald head with his handkerchief; even to him the
morning, lends romance. His fleshy face changes almost as one
looks at him. One sees again tire jad, with his .vague hopes, his
absurd ambitions.
1 r T was in Paris, many years ago, that I fell by chance into this
habit of early rising;. My night, by reasons that I need not
enter into, had been a troubled one. Tired of the hot bed
that pave no sleep, I rose and dressed myself, crept down
the creaking stairs, experiencing the sensations of a burglar
new to his profession, unbolted the great. door of the hotel and
passed out into an unknown,' silent; city, : bathed in a mysterious
soft light. Since then this strange, sweet city of the dawn has
thevcr ceased to call to me. It may be in London, in Paris again, in.
Brussels, Berlin, Vienna,' that 1 have gone to sleep, but if per
chance I wake before the returning tide of human life has dimmed
its glories with the mists and vapors of the noisy day, I know that

years ago â this city that knows no tears, no sorrow, â¢ through

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
7by a S. MeClurÂ« Company.
rp~ GENERATION ago a wagon cov
/ I . ered with white canvas turned
I I to the right on the California
JL road and look a northerly course
toward a prairie stream that nestled
Just under a long, low bluff. When the
white pilgrim. Jolting over the rough,
unbroken ground through the tall "blue
stem" grass, reached a broad bend in
the stream it stopped. A man and a
woman emerged from under the canvas
and stood for a moment facing the
wild, creen meadow and the distant
>it?in- The m^n was young, lithe and
graceful, but despite his boyish figure
the woman felt his unconscious
strength as he put his arm' about her
waist- She was aglow with health; her
fine, strong. Intelligent eyes burned
with hope, and her firm Jaw was good
to behold. They Btood gazing at the
virgin field a moment In silence. There
were tears in the woman's eyes as she
looked up after the kiss and said:
"And this Is the end of our wedding
journey; and â anfl â the honeymoonâ
the only cue we can ever have in all
the world â is over."
The horses, moving uneasily in their
sweaty harness, cut short the man's re
ply. When he returned his wife was
getting the cooking utensils from un
der the T.agon. and life â stern, trou
bious â had besun for them.
It was thus that young Colonel Wil
liam Hucks brought his wife to Kan-
sas.
They were young, strong, hearty peo
ple, end they conquered the wilderness.
A home sprang up in ihe elbow of the
Elream. In the fall long rows of corn
shocks trailed what had been the mead
ow. In the summer the field stood
horse-high with corn. From the bluff,
as the years flew by, the spectator
might see the checkerboard of the farm,
clean cut. well kept, smiling in the sun.
Little children frolicked in the king
row and hurried to school down the
green lines of the lanes where the
hedges grow.
There were years when the light in
the kitchen burned*far into the night,
w hen two heads bent over the table,
figuring to make ends meet. In these
years the girlish figure became bent
and the light faded in the woman's
eyes, while the lithe figure of the man
was gnarled by the rigors of the strug
gle. There were days â not years,
thank God â when lips forgot their
tenderness; and, as fate tugged fierce
ly at the curbed bit, there were times
Â¦when souls rebelled and cried out in
bitterness and despair at the rough
nrss of the path.
In this wise went Colonel William
Hucks and his wife through youth into
maturity and in this wise they faced
toward the sunset.
He was tall, with a stoop; grizzled,
brawny, perhaps uncouth in mien. She
was stout, unshapely, rugged; yet her
face was 'kind and motherly. There
was a boyish twinkle left in her hus
band's eyes and a quaint, quizzing, one
sided smile often stumbled across his
care-furrowed countenance. As the
years passed Mrs. Hucks noticed that
her husbands foot fell heavily when
he walked by her side and the pang
the felt when first she observed his
plodding step was too deep for tears. :
It was In these days that the minds
of the Huckses unconsciously reverted
to old times. It became their wont, in
these latter days^to sit in the silent
house, whence the children had gone
out to try issue with the world, and,
of evenings, to talk of the old faces
and of the old places in the home of
their youth. Theirs had been a
pinched and busy life. They had never
returned to visit their old Ohio home.
The colonel's father and mother were
gone. His wife's relatives were not
there. Yet each felt the longing to go
back.
For years they had talked of the
charms of the home of their child
hood. Their children had been brougnt
up to believe that the place was lit
tle less than heaven. The Kansas
grass seemed ehort and barren of
beauty to them beside the picture of
the luxury of Ohio's fields. For uiem
the Kansas streams did not ripple and
dimple so merrily in the sun as the
Ohio brooks that romped through
dewy pastures In their memories. The
Weak Kansas plain, in winter and in
fall, seemed to the colonel and his wife
to be ugly and gaunt when they re
membered the brow of the hill under
which their first kis3 was shaded from
the moon, while the world gTew <3lm
under a elelgh that bounded over the
turnpike.
The old people did not give voice
to their musings. But in the woman's
heart there gnawed a yearning for the
beauty of the old scenes. It was al
most a physical hunger.
After their last child, a girl, had
married and had gone down the lane
toward the lights of the village Mrs,
Hucks began to watch with a greedy
eye the dollars mount toward a sub
stantial bank account She hoped
that ehe and her husband might af
ford a holiday. %
Last year Providence blessed the
Huckses with plenty. It was the
woman who revived the friendship of
youth In her husband's cousin, who
lives in the 'old township in Ohio. It
was Mrs. Hucks who secured from
that cousin an invitation to spend a
few weeks in the Ohio homestead. It
was Mrs. Hucks, again, who made her â¢
husband/heppy by putting him into a.\.
tailor'i-reult^rtlie first he had bought^
eince hisiwedilisisr â for the great ;pc-~
casion. Co$meif"Huck3 needed no per
suasion to take the trip. Indeed, it
was , his wife's economy which had
kept him from beings spendthrift and

.meanjnsv. glances when the colonel

"Arc^jiwuV sorry you. come, father?"
said JyfiB. Ifucks, as the colonel was
about to'fall into a_doze.
"I don't know;-ar^ybu?" he asked.
"Well. yes. -rgfiesa 4 I am. I haven't

And bo they looked at pictures " of
youth through the eyes of age. How
Mrs. Hucks' eVes were wet and her
voice broke at the end of the sentence.
"Mother," cried the colonel,: as; he
went around the corner of the house,
"Think of it/ father,"^. ;8ald:..Mrs.
Hucks as she turned to 'desperid from
the porch. "Thirty: years agc--*nd

The day /which and'^Mrs."
William Hucks set aparUf or 'starting
upon their Journey was one' of those
perfect Kansas days inVearlyj October.'
The rain had washed Â«f the {.summer's
dust from the air, clearing^? it\? arid
stenciling the lights and '^Sades- very,
sharply. The woods along^th'e .-little
stream which flowed through' 'the.
farm had not been greener^ at -*Â¦ any
time during: the season. The second
crop of grass on the hillside;:ajmost
sheened In vividness. The yellow?of
the stubble in the grain .flelds^w^a^all.
but a glittering golden.i- The sky-was'
a deep, glorious 1 , blue,! and the j big,
downy clouds which Numbered" lazily
here and there in the depths of It ap
peared near and palpable. -The "old
couple paused outside the front .'door
while Colonel Hucks fumbled with the
key. , : .. .C^'l;
lions* again, horn* *x*lsÂ»
From a foreign Â«horÂ».
And so Colonel William Hucks
brought his wife back to Kansas. Here
their youth is woven Into the very
soil they love; here every tree around
their home has its sacred history; here
every day above them recalls some day
of trial and of hope.
Here in the gloaming to-night stands
an old man, bent and grizzled. His
eyes are dimmed with tears, which he
would -not acknowledge to the" world,
arid he is ?dreaming : strange dreams
while he listens to'a little cracked
voice in the kitchen half humming
and half singing:
"Now, lookie at that dog â coma
tearin* up here like he never saw white
folks before!"
The colonel turned his head away.
He was afraid to trust himself to
speech. He clucked to the horses and
drove down the lane. As they came
into the yard the colonel put an arm
about his wife and pressed his cheek
against her face. Then he said drony:
"It has been a Ions day, William,
but you nave been good to me. Has
it been a happy day for you, father?"
"What is it that fool Rlley feller
says about 'Grigsby's Station, where
we used to be so happy and 90
pore?'"
As the colonel and his wife passed
out of the town into the quiet coun
try, where the shadows were growing
long and black, and where the gentle
blue haze was hanging over the dis
tant hills that undulated the horizon,
a silence fell upon the two hearts.
Each mind sped back over a lifetime
to the evening when they had turned
out of the main road In which they
were traveling:. A dog barkinj in the
meadow behind the hedge did not
startle them from their reveries. The
restless cattle wandering down the
hillside toward the bars made a nat
ural complement to the picture which
they loved. ' :,Â¦Â¦ '
"It is almost sunset, father," said
tho wife, as she put her hand upon
her husband's arm.
Her touch and the voice in which
she had spoken tightened some chord
at his throat. The colonel could only
repeat, as he avoided her gaze:
"Yes, almost sunset, mother; almost
sunset."
"How do you suppose they live harÂ«
In this country, anyway, father* Dca't
any one here seem to own any of the
land Jolnln* them, and they'd no more
think of puttln' in water tanks and
windmills around their farms than
they'd think of flyin*. I Just wish Mary
could coma out and see my new kitchen
sink with the hot and cold water in It.
Why, she almost fainted when I told
her how to fix a dreen for her dish
water and things." Then, after a sigh,
she added, "But they are so unpro
gressive here, nowadays."
That was the music which the colonel
loved, and he took up the strain and
carried the tune for a few miles. Then
it became a duet, and the two old sou'.a
were very happy.
They were overjoyed at being bound
for Kansas. They hungered for kin
dred spirits. At Peoria in the early
morning they awakened from their
chair car nap3 to hear a strident female
voice saying:
"Well, sir. when the rain did finally
come, Mr. Morris he Just didn't think
there was a thing left worth cutting
on the place, but lo and behold, we
got over forty bushel to the acre oft
of that field, a3 it was."
The colonel was thoroughly awake
In an instant and he nudged his wife,
as the voice went on:
"Mr. Morris he wag so afraid the
wheat was winter killed; all the pa
pers said it was; and then come the
late frost, which every one said had
ruined It â but law me "
Mrs. Hucks could stand It no longer.
With her husband's cane she reached
the owner of the voice and sld:
"Excuse me, ma'am, but what parx
of Kansas are you from?"
It seemed like a meeting with *
dear relative. The rest of the Journey
to Kansas City was a hallelujah cho
rus, wherein the colonel sang a pow
erful and telling bass.
As the train pulled into the little
town on Willow Creek that afternuou
the colonel craned his neck at the
car window to catch the first glimpse
of the big red standpipe and of the
big stone schoolhouse on the hilL
When the whistle blew for the station
the colonel said:
While the women were sitting la fhÂ»
bÂ«S8ry at the depot waiting for thm
train Mrs. Hucks found herself saying?
"And as for fruit â why, we fed ap
ples to the hogs this fall. I sold the
cherries, all but what was on one tree
near the house, and I put up sixteen
quarts from just two sides of that tree,
and never stepped my foot off the
ground to pick 'em."
When they were comfortably seated
on the homeward-bound train Mrs.
Hucks said to her husband:
The day after this concession Mrs.
JIucks began to grow homesick. At
first she worried about the stock; the
colonel's chief care was about tha dog.
The fifth day's visit was their last. As
they were driving to the town to taka
the train for Kansas Mrs. Hucks over
heard her husband discoursing some
thing after this fashion:
"I tell you, Jim, before I'd slavo my
life out on an 'eighty* the way you*rÂ«
doln*. Td go out takin' In whltawasMn*.
It's Just like this â a man In Kansas has

advantages In every way, than yovfy%

Ibex If he met It on the road."
the colors were faded! "What a trasrto
difference there Is between the light
which springs from the dawn and tha
Clow which falls from the sunset!
. After that first day Colonel Hucfcs
did not restrain his bragging about
Kansas. And Mrs. Hucks gave rein to
her pride when she heard him. Before
that day she had reserved a secret con
tempt for a Kansas boaster, and had
ever wished that he might see what
Ohio could do In the particular Una
which he was praising. But now Mrs.
Hucka caught herself saying to her
hostess, "What small ears of corn you
raise here!"

8no_textupon it for. the fitting.
One woman declares that she stood
upon an unabridged dictionary . one
mortal hour while her skirt was being
hung, it .was turned up Just even with
the ground. And , when it was com
pleted it was so very long in the middle
of the front that it had to be lifted
with the hands. The Eugenie lift this
Is .; called, right . in the middle of the
front. -
For the autumn there is every hope
for the woman who /will, sew a little.
She can take her sleeves from last fall
and transform them in rational ways.
If they have tight cuffs the chances are
the cuffs are 1 not deep enough. They
must be lengthened ' by piecing * them
down with a band of chiffon velvet.
This band of velvet can be embroidered
many old ones that still hold their
sway and grow, if possible, stronger
with the seasons. One of these is the
button vogue and the other la the
vogue of medallions, ;,;"
very deep ruffles of lace. This is an
admirable. sleeve f/ f or any fall coat, and
it has the merit of dressing uV the coat
remarkably.
It is a very excellent thing to own
one coat with dressy sleeves. It is use
ful for slipping on at any required time.
A coat with wide sleeves trimmed with
lace can be worn to'*luncheon parties,
It is very nice for club meetings and it
can be brought out and worn over-one's
black satin calling gown.
It would be such a wise thing for the
woman who is thinking of fall' if she
were, to invest in a satin gown. Let it
be of some .dark colorâ a seal brown
with high lights itf it, or, the ever ad
mirable navy blue. Or, most service
able of ' all, she tan select a glossy
black satin.
As a best dress satin will be the very
thing all the fall and winter, and If
the gown be made up r with an Eton
coat viyi *tole fronts it will be warm
and handsome until cold weather. And
it can be made to do. duty in midwin
ter, for It can be with furs on
very cold days, and so it proves to be
an aU-the-year-round dress.
A handsome deep golden brown
satin gown was made up almost
like a shirt waist suit. The skirt was
laid in kilts stitched to below the hips
and trimmed yjaround the foot "with a.
pointed trimming. *2The coat : was some
thing of a Russian. blouse, belted at the
waist and drawn 'down. in a very long
point. The '"'A sleeves' were immensely
widje and txinifned with lace >â¢ dyed
brown. â¢'*â¢â¢' â¢ Â¦ ">
There are many points, in favor of the
Batin gown for fall wear. It' Is unde
niably "dressy. It; is .very fashionable,
for it ' is an old .material enjoying a
great revival "period, and -it is durable.
It is Just warm enough, : and for; early
fall modishly made ' It is " a very nice
addition to- any woman's- wardrobe. It
is a material that can be' put away for
wear next spring if so desired. .
Yet, while preaching sathV one gets
will make it In the prevailing mode.
The round skirt with Bhirred hip
yoke and the round skirt with tucked
hips are holding their own well and
for' early fall they make a very pretty
gown, though there is the side plait
ed skirt with the plaits stitched upon
the ships, and for absolute style there
is nothing that is any more elegant.
The black taffetas of .early. fall will
be made with a choice of skirts. If one
does not want to cling to the tucked
hips and 4.he plaid designs, there is a
skirt -which is built, very full and
which is ruffled around the foot.
How to Hang Your Skirt.
There are certain rules for these
skirts and the observance of them will
make a gown. One is that the skirt
shall barely escape the ground all the
way around. ' The second is that It
shall be a little shorter in the back
than In the front. This is to insure
a smart flare. And the third. Is that
the material shall have sufficient stiff
ness to set well out and not cling to
the figure. The stiffness can. be se
cured by the wearing of a handsome
ruffled petticoat or by cutting the
skirt out of material which will not
grow slinky.
Then, when it comes to the waist
of the first fall costume, one hesitates
again, for surely there is a choice. The
woman who -wants to look seasonable
will choose a little jacket, or, at least,
a simulated Jacket. She will try to
make her suit true to its title, a fall
suit in . appearance, even though it
may be for warm day wear.
Immensely smart will be. the three
quarter silk coats made of black taf
feta, and quite as smart will be the
three-quarter silk coats, made of tan
and of the heavier ecru and coffee
colored linens and of the full weight
pongees.
It is going to be a fall when the
separate jacket will be fashionable
and when the woman who does not
want to wear a suit all alike can vary
her appearance with a coat that con
trasts with her costume.
.. The contrasting coat for fall can be
fltted In the back; rather straight in
the front, faced' with a self color and
with braid. The rest of the cuff Is then
embroidered and the sleeve Is new
again.
The old last spring gown can be made
almost new by:theadditlon # of a mili
tary vest. This- is to be very much the
style. It Is a vest that hangs straight,
exactly filling : up the, opening in the
front of the coat or bodice.;
Every effort is made- in putting in a
vest to have the lines hang as straight
as pqssible and to put In the vest with
military .; precision. Its material 13
brown or blue, gray or white satin, and
it Is embroidered with colors of gold
and blue.; - - .'' f . <\]
Such a Fad for Buttons,
Though it is coming fall and one
looks, for all" new modes;,' there are
In buttons there is a greater variety
than ever. They come larger and morÂ»
elegant, costing prices that ought tÂ»
buy a gown. In the other extrems
there are buttons that are very small,
but made of very nice material, and
these are used abundantly for trim
mlnlng purposes. Little brass buttons
are used to trim a girdle; little brass
buttons are employed upon' a stock;
small buttons of blue and whits arÂ«
used for vest and jacket trimmings
and buttons that are extremely beau
tiful decorate street blouses and walk
ing gowns. The handsomest of thÂ«
new buttons are made of three or four
materials, showing, frequently, a fili
gree over gold or over silver. And
others are made of different colored
stones, all inset, while still others are
of metal, with designs set with pre
cious stones.
The silk buttons and the hand
painted buttons and the buttons that
are covered with the dress goods arÂ«
all very much used. and. since they
are inexpensive, as well as beautiful,
they are becoming fast favorites.
One very charming button is tha
button of white silk, painted with a
flower. This makes a handsome deco
ration for a calling dres3 and it is Â»
button that can be used upon gown3
of even nicer destination.
A woman who dines out a great deal
has just brouglit back to life an old
bodice of Irish lace. It was an inex
pensive waist, which had becoxna soil
ed. Cutting out the stock. Â»h< h^n
made a Dutch r.eck, which Â»h* will
wear with a band of velvet around the
throat.
The sleeves she will bring up to
date by cutting them off and adding
lingerie cuffs. The front of the waist
she will trim by draping a race fichu
across the yoke and here and there
she will catch the lace fichu up with
a large, handsome hand painted but
ton.
For nice evening waists the hand
palntsd outton is set in a little rim
of Valenciennes lace, shirred and
gathered around the button. Again
one sees the button set in the middla
of a rosetta of ribbon. Either way it
Is very pretty.
It is a good time for the woman
who is determined to dress well to
study the styles, for now they are
shaping themselves for . something
at ihe arm:; to give the appearance of
a cape with deep epaulettes. She has
abb brought into vogue the braided
vest Ebowing handsome braids put on
In nil colors :in<l executed in military
dpsijrrss. And Miss Horner has in
vented a veil all trimmed with fringe.
By these signs and many others one
5 reminded that it is fall and that
one must think of something new to
wear.
It is time to ccme home and begin
the life of fall and winter. True, va
cation time is still on. but the thought
of home begins to be very inviting.
And with thoughts of the homecoming
there begi:i to creep into* the mind
thoughts of the autumn wardrobe'and
plans for ius successful carrying out.
And just here there comes a time
when the woman with plenty of money
possesses a great advantage over the
woman with none at all or very lit
tle. The girl on nothing a year must
do the best &he can. while the young
woman with a definite fixed allowance,
.and tha.t allowance a large one, can do
almost anything she wishes to do. '
It is a Reason In the fashion world
when money will do it all. Not for
many seasons past has there been such
a decided opportunity for the spend
ing of coin, and never in all the world
has the money-spending woman had
such a chance with her money. She
can do anything and everything with
the necessary funds.
In the realm of jewels she has mag
nificent opportunities. The opening up
of the Orient has brought ov^er to this
country marvelous Jewels, mock and
real, all of which are made up into
the most (harming set for waists, for
buckles, for hut ornaments and for
brooches, hat pins and cuff ornaments.
Paillettes and passementeries, em
broideries and insets alike glisten with
Bemi-precious stones of marvelous
color until one's gown shows a glow
of color such as it could never have
obtained without these gems. Dull
heavy yellows, brilliant wine reds and
the most wonderful greens are all to
be found in these dress embroideries.
It is a fact that will not be disput
ed that Jewel trimmings go a great
way upon a gown. They can make a
very plain one over into a gorgeous
garment and they can transform a
dress of everyday elegance into some
thing handsome enough for a diplo
matic reception.
Indeed, the rejuvenating powers of
Jeweled bands are so well known that
many women make a point of collect
ing' them, buying them as they would
buy lace, as an investment, something
to have in the house to be used in
case of need.
Lovely Jewel Trimmings.
A youcg woman who visits much at
the home of Mrs. Secretary Hay is the
owner of a set of turquoise embroid
eries. They are in the shape of stole
fronts, of a high neck stock and of a
pair of embroidered cuffs. In addi
tion to these pieces there Is a deep
flounce of lace, appllqued with heavier
lace and embroidered with blue
stones. With this she wears a really
wonderful gold and imitation tur
quoise chain and carries a fan of tur
quoise setting. For the hair ehe has
a couple of pins that dance upon, spi
rals, making a pretty blue flitter. -

10I TT UST now the girl in the bow and
; I the man at the tiller of the Cupid
! 1 were not on speaking terms. For
[\ZS fully ten minutes the frigid silence
jhad been broken, only by the swish of
;the boat's prow through the water and
;by the splash of the waves on her*
â¢cheeks.
; Two "Ohs!" sounded simultaneously
las the man and the girl felt the cold
;water close over them, then as they
Ibobbed up. the right arm of the man
Ifirmly encircled the girl's waist, while
!he held the boat with the other. With
>out a word, he raised her to the side of
;the overturned yacht and climbed up
jhimself.
; The girl laughed. "It's pretty wet,"
;she said, trying hard to keep her bal
ance on the wave-rocked boat.
I "Aâ yes.". Plainly. the man was re-
Ilieved. For a minute he had cursed
!his own recklessness, but if she were
Jonly "wet" need he worry? .
â¢ A lapse of a minute ensued while
they adjusted themselves to their un
usual positions.
"Aren't you sorry?" asked the girl,
surveying her bedraggled duck frock.
"Aren't you?" the man retorted.
The plunging had not cleared the at
mosphere, remnants of the frigidity
remained.
After a minute the girl looked at him.
"How are we to get home?" she asked.
"I have an engagement this evening."
"I am aware of that," the man re
turned. "And with me."
"I believe I explained to you before
âbefore the boat went over, that I was
not going with you to that dance." The
girl's hair was blowing about her face,
and her cheeks were bright with the
fresh sunburn. The man had never
seen , her so pretty. Few girls are at
their best on. the side of an overturned
boat far out In the sound.
"And "I am explaining to you now
that until you promise to go with me
instead of that Tompkins fellow to
night you will not go at all." His
tone was firm.
A wave nearly threw them off ttteir
balance and the sail flapped back and
forth 'joyously, in the water. The
Cupid was laughing.. Every time a
wave jolted the two perched on her
side they grasped the edge of the
boat and unconsciously drew closer
together.
The man 'went on: "It is a mean
advantage,' but think, haven't you
played with me long enough? Aren't
you going to tell me what I've wanted
to know so long?" Hemoved closer
to her and in so doing rocked the boat
dangerously.' Â¦ : " .
"N-no," the girl answered between
breaths. ; ";â¢ <r Â¦ ;
"Then. -"we'll stay here. We will reÂ«
main on i this overturned boat until
you promise to marry me â and soon,
too." .
'.'But ifâ if I don't love you," ar
gued the girl, avoiding hi3 eyes.
"You do, though," he said confi
dently. '
The eirl elevated her eyebrows.
Things had taken a new turn.
â¢Til' drown If â If we stay here
much longer," she said after a min
ute, trying to assume a pleading tone.
The man drew still nearer â almost
close. "Don't you love me, dear?" he
asked. "
"Youâ you know," she said, grab
bing the side of the boat, as a big wave
swept them several feet on its crest.
The man put his arm slowly, firm
ly, about her' waist. "And you will
marry me?" Â¦ â¢
He < heard only ; the flapping of the
Cupid's sail In the water. The girl
did not answer.
"Won't you?" he repeated.
The girl slid slowly from his em-i
brace, looking him full in the eyes. <
Her feet touched the water. Â«
"Yes," she cried, and struck outj
among the waves with a stroke even;
the man might have envied herâ had J
he not been too astonished. {
"Andâ Jackâ " she called between J
waves, "youâ see â Iâ I did not have to;

sat beside him at the tiller he noticed;

easy to ascertain what the bride's expects gifts to be ordered from. The
pattern is and then match it to a . bride-to-be finds out what each one
of her immediate family is to do
nate to the good cause, and then, if
possible, she quizzes her nearest and
dearest friends. From them she is
able to figure out fairly well what she
wants to complete her ornaments and
necessities, and then she adopts a
method peculiarly and particularly her
own. First, she sits down anC makes
out a list of what she needs and an
other of what she would like. This is
typewritten and duly delivered to the
chief clerk of the silversmith or to
the head of the crystal room, and he,
of course, instructs his men to act ac
cordingly.
For instance, when a customer comes
In and glances about vaguely and
murmurs "wedding present," the clerk
straightway sits up and takes notice.
At any and all times It is his duty to
suggest this, that and the other thing,
for nfne-tenths of the buyers haven't
the least idea what they want when
they enter a shop. After a few trials
the wily clerk asks what pattern they
want and how the silver is to be mark
ed, and the innocent victim replies. "I
don't know. Perhaps something has
been ordered from here for Miss
Susie Smith." That is a most beauti
ful inning, and exactly what the cleric
wanted. If Miss Susie has paid the
shop a visit and left her list behind
as a gentle reminder he knows pre
cisely what to do: and, on the other
hand, if her name fails to suggest
anything the least familiar he knows
again what to do, and in neither case
does he make a mistake.
Household cilvc-r is always accepta
ble, as is crystal; but there are many
people who hesitate long before invest
ing In spoons, knives and forks and
the like, for in this age of elaborate
gifts it is always the part of some one
of the immediate family to come forth
with a chest. To be sure, there are
exceptions, for every now and then a
house and lot is preferred; but in or
dinary households, where the ex
chequer has to be considered, pspecial
ly at t* " expensive period, 'the chest
is all the family- purse will permit,
and even then it Is frequently stretch
ed most uncomfortably.

end -will not fail to be a jjy forever.
Pins, hatpins, rings and the thousand
and one trinkets that delight the heart
of all femininity are among the many
gifts that are always appropriate, but
there is never anything new or start
ling about them and they are rated
among the commonplace. Occasionally
a nox - elty comes forth to gladden the
heart of a slender pocket book, and
certainly the nifty umbrella with Its
neat little watch in the handle is one of
them. The umbrella itself is quite like
the ordinary colored silk one, the only
difference being in its size, for as a
general rule they are Just large enough
for one, and even then do not appear
awkward, as they are made to repre
sent a smart sunshade. But this is not
the main difference. The handle, dain
tily tie/rf up In gayly colored cords and
tassels, is of gun metal and in the
knob, cunningly held in place by a
spring, is the smartest gun metal
watch imaginable. Such an umbrella,")
for they come in all colors and in plain
â¢black, is not a half bad idea for a wed
ding gift, for it may be utilized by both
members of the little family and really
see active service.
time for all the friends end
relatives to bethink themselves of
unique and appropriate gifts, for even
if the strain is painful it is absolutely
necessary and it is far better to laugh
than cry over the bitter dose.
The selfish bride thinks only of her
self. Ten to one she married to length
en her pocket book and so she goes out
of her way to let her admirers know
that dainty personal gifts will be quite
acceptable. In fact, more acceptable
than anything else. Casually â without
thinking and without meaning any
thing, of course â she toys with her sil
ver watch and wishes it were a gold
one. '"If wishes were horses the beg
gars cou!d ride," and the first thing she
knows she is riding serenely, and her
silver watch has turned, as though by
magic, to diamonds and pearls.
And such a watch, by the way, is
perfectly exquisite and one that any
girl throughout the land would be only
too glad to possess. The watch itself,
almost a miniature one, is encased sol
idly in pearls and the face is made gay
with gold threads and letters that are
meant both for ornament and practical
use. Instead of a chain a dragon is
used, and in itself is something entirely
out of the ordinary. The dra
gon, cf all designs, is, per-,
haps, the most effective, especially
when it seems to be carrying on its
battles armed with a diamond sword
topped with a. single beautiful whole
pearl. The rir.gle eye is a diamond as
well, and it spends, its time sparkling
about and winking flirtatiously at
every soul that chances to glance its
way. Of course, such a bauble is hand'
some and a pretty trinket for every
woman, but unless a man is very un
selfish he may wonder where he comes
In on this particular gift.

straightway launches into a list of ar

with his choice and all but shaking
hands with himself on account of the
amount of Ingenuity displayed. "She
certainly will not receive another like
that," he says, and of a truth she will
cot, though he Is In no wise responslbis
for that fact.
The prettiest mirror, and an inex
pensive one by the way, Is heart
shaped and set in an exquisite frame
of dull gray silver. A satin finished
heart, miniature of course, is fashioned
for the monogram and the trinket la
ready for use. And mirrors hav* two
advantages to recommend them. They
are not only an ornament but arÂ« de
cidedly useful as well, and they can
be both one and the other at the samo
time and not try very hard either.
Decanters and water bottles com*
under the head of necessities, though,
to be sure, it Is not absolutely essantlal
to have one's liquors poured from a
rose colored jar heavily trimmed with
gold or silver. However, the effect 13
good and no one can gainsay the fact
that china makes or mars a dainty
table.
The newest decanters are beautiful,
almost too pretty to be pressed Into
actual service, but at the saraÂ» time
there certainly i3 not much pleasure
in possessing things that are too -fins
to be used. China is newer than crys
tal and the trimming Is Just about
what one fancies. Not that this nov
elty comes by the dozens or anything
like that, but because one may order
them and rest assured that they will
be turned out absolutely fit. Great red
and pink roses, with here and there a
few firreen leaves by way of additional
coloring, are lovely, especially wheo
they are set on a background of whlta
damask and touched up with glints of
silver and sparkles of crystal. Great
sprawly crysanthemums In all the
shades of yellow are effective and thÂ»
off shades of blue in strictly conven
tional designs are not to be treated
lightly or with scorn.
In this age of dens one's wedding
list is not complete unless it comprises
a horn .smoking set, or at least a- horn
writing outfit. The smoking set is a
beauty and a bit of furnishing that
cannot help but be a great addition to
any den, no matter how unique or how
elaborate its settings may be. There
are two glasses.- a tray, a match safe.
a place for pipes and a small alcohol
lamp that burns along steadily and
laughs in its sleeve at the cigars and
cigarettes that forget to "smoke up"
and consequently go out. The horn Is
twisted in such a fashion that it forms
a brace for the gold trimmings which
complete the outfit and at the same
time it adds its touch of swelldom and
makes the set the smartest of the.
smart.
Unique vases always gladden thÂ»
heart of any homebody, for nothing
dresses up a room so much as a few
handsome articles. They need not be
gay in tone, exceptional In size or rare
in ware, but as Ions as they are good
in design and in color they fill a niche
in their* own comforting fashion.
New wares are continually flooding
the markets and each and every one of
(Â¦them are pretty, but they are not al-
Iways serviceable, which is more to the
I point. Even In the best of regulated
[families accidents are bound to occur
'occasionally, and it seems such a pity
to throw a hundred dollars down and
Â¦out of existence at the same time. Yet
Â¦this is Just what happens every time
;a fragile vase is thrown from its ped
iestal. Most beautiful ones are fashioned
from all metals, and the daintiest fig
ures that serve as a trimming make
them little short of works of art. Then,
too. they are not nearly aa perishable,
which is a big item in their favor.
Of course, gifts of every nature
should be acceptable and should al
ways please, but it Is a risky piece of
business to buy a picture or anything
iin the furniture line, for what pleases
one to a T is regarded by another as
simply atrocious. But just as long as
fads are in style it will be safe to buy
novelties, for if they are not appre
ciated from the artistic standpoint they
will be from the stylish end, and, after
all, what's the odds Just aa long as
they please?

"Ah," you say, "it is all hazy with
doubt." Well, then, treat it as a con
tingency, but let the mere possibility
of it purify and ennoble your daily
living. Suppose that some day you
wake up and find yourself in a strange
new environment, in the midst of op
portunities for ampler, richer life than
you have ever enjoyed here upon the
earth. Suppose that you find yourself
in the presence of a great searcher of
human hearts to whom you will have
to render strict account of what you
have done with your time and your
talents. Would you endure the tender
yet searching scrutiny of such a judge?
Would you take your place with the
upright and valiant of all the ages?
Would you go on into the. vast

ALLOWING FOR CONTINGENCIES
and when on the bias. Somehow or
other it's lots more fun to learn how to
do things if you're laboring under the
impression that you're playing and
that "you don't have to do it, any
way." There really is a heap more ac
complished In this way, and this not
only holds good with children, but with
grown-up children as well, for there
never fails to be a peculiar fascination
about the things that one is not abso
lutely obliged to do.
Besides doll wardrobes these., young
ladies of leisure dabbled In water colors
and painted the most marvelous pic
tures imaginable. This, however,
wasn't done with the idea of turning
out finished artists or anything like
that, but merely for the sake of teach
ing color and tone effects, for Third and
Linden delights in vivid reds elabor
ately trimmed with magenta pinks, and
with other combinations that are
strikingly out of the ordinary.
The. first thing on the programme in
the morning wa3 singing. Any one of
the teachers seated herself at the piano
and waited patiently until the babbling
for certain numbers had ceased, and
-The -first thing in the morning, be
fore the gates were unlocked, the early
blrda got into the yard any old way
and camped serenely on the steps,
self monarch of all she surveyed and in
a most enviable position.
And the teachers themselves. They
were another difficult nut to crack, but.
like all other difficulties, a way was
soon found, out of it. It chances that
the Oakland Club devotees are mostly
members of the Ebell Club, and the
main difference between the two is that
one is social and the other philan
thropic. Each active member was to
spread the tidfn^s that teachers were
in demand. They were to come for a
certain day a week, or even part of a
day, and they were to come for a va
riety of purposes. The result was In
stantaneous. Half the socletygirls of the
town who were not adding their mite
of frivolity to house parties responded
to the call just for the fun of the thing.
The Misses Alberta and Sybil Jones
went on certain mornings, and while
one permitted herself to be most glo
riously Dalnted with bright and flam
ing colors, the .other sat at the piano
and wrestled with a song until the pa
tience of a martyr would have been
somewhat tried. Miss Elma Farnham
Instructed in the mysteries of weaving
and Miss Remillard pricked her fingers
and had frequent snips taken out of
her frock, all in the same good cause.
And in this way variety was added.
It might have become a little irksome
after weeks passed by with the same
teacher, but where every day, and fre
quently every half-day, brought a new
face and new mannerisms, the fun was
kept at the highest pitch, for the same
pranks could be played any number of
times and with varying results.
One branch of the summer session
was always crowded to Its utmost ca
pacity and its workers were always
filled to bubbling: over with enthu
siasm. Whenever the principal said
"cooking school" the youngsters
couldn't get their hats on fast enough,
for of all the classes this one alone was
outside the Tompkins Schyol. Among
other schemes that the club* dabbles in
ell the time is- this selfsame kitchen
department, and they keep an excel
lently equipped school running through
out the year and a teacher who in
structs in all culinary mysteries. First,
apple jelly is made, then a meat pie
with dumplings, and so on, varying day
after day and always getting more
dainty and complex, until the graduate
should be able to go home and wrestle
with the pots and pans and do it in a
skillful, scientific fashion, too.
Saturday was the heydey and was
looked forward to throughout the length
and breadth of the week, for as regular
ly as it came around Mrs. Gray took
her life in her hands and some fifty or
more children under her wing and sal
lied forth Into the country. She lined
up her regiment and counted to se?
how many she had and every time she
moved from the spot that was marked
with the cross she counted all over
again to see that some of them had not
been lost in the shuffle.
# "I'll confess I did not anticipate any
great amount of pleasure, but no onÂ«
else seems to care about taking them
and I don't like promises broken. So
I went religiously and was duly thank
ful when I got them all home safe and
. sound."
Fancy wrestling with fifty lively
youngsters! Imagine herding that lot
on train or car and seeing that their
thousand and one want3 were cared
for during the day. It really isn't to
1 be wondered at that "nobody else
i seems to want to do it." Somehow or
! other, it doesn't sound especially allur
j ing.
wi me seven any one calling at the
home of Mrs. Francis Gray was duly
Informed "that she Is at school." First
one and then another helper dropped
out. went to the country or had a con
venient houseful of company. Every
thing and an> thing, in fact, that sound
ed like a legitimate excuse ' was
proffered, until Mrs. Gray found her-
y"5Â» AKLAN'D is Pitting up and tak-
J \ ing notice. A swift runner was
\J! dispatched into the outlying
country with a message that
ail members of the tribe were to gather

Â¦svere to assemble without further de-
In twos and in threes and in families
entire th' 1 summoned came, and when
ih^y vero gathered together the? patri
eroh'ruse to his feet and spoke in this
wise: "My children. I have summoned
you hoie to, discuss an ail Important
subject. The Tribe West Oakland is
in distress. When our rivals first com
menced t<Â» aid humanity in general,
we. in our selfishness, thought only of
ourselves.- Now a work has come t^Â»

forthwith the gray-haired oM patriarch
led his children to the flowing bowl.
So the members of the Oakland Club
ssFembled. And the Oakland Club, be
; it known, is just another name for do
ing good. For w-ars they tried to hide
their candle under a bushel, but the
light of their good deeds found them
Â«Â«ut at last and they were accordingly
tried and found guilty of magic and the
worst kind of witchcraft. Their right
hand didn't know what their left one
was doing and that in itself was plenty

The last assembly was to discuss the
juvenile question. Every city provides
some recreation park or place for the
yemngsters who are not so fortunate
% es to leave town during their vacation,
"but Oakland is somewhat behind the
limes in this respect and things are
decidedly lively in certain sections as
s consequence.

hood of Tompkir.s School have been
kept on the alert dodging stray balls
and an occasional rock and repairing
broken windows and badly ruined tem
pers. What the youngsters in that part
of town can't think of really isn't
worth thinking of and the six weeks'
leisure is little if any short of a horrible
nightmare.
"A summer-school is what we want,"
.was the cry, and a summer session was
what they straightway got.
* Not the- regulation, bona fide school .

of course, for all work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy â and, ten to one,
o.r.yway, there would have been more
playing "hookey" than anything else.
But a play school it was, and it
served its point inasmuch as it kept
the youthful friends off the street and
permitted others to draw a long breath
â¢ and walk about without keeping a
: weather eye on every corner and on
every tree.
'<= Tommy was asked if he didn't want
to learn how to make baskets for sale
and his running mate was duly im
pressed with the importance of fash
ioning new chairs and reseating old
ones. "Somebody might buy a basket,
you know, or need a new chair seat,"
ivas edded and the question was settled
right then and there. For If there was
any money In it the boys were ready to
1 vork from early until late and to work
right faithfully, too.
One fellow spread the glad tidings to

school, the only one. by the way, west
of the Rockies. When It was time for
dismissal the youngsters hung about
like so many troublesome bees, for
there was a heap more fun and enter
tainment at school than at home or
even on the streets, and the worst
pranks they could think of didn't any
where near come up to earning money
and being quite a man of affairs, for
the baskets were bought now and then,
to help the good cause along and to
keep interest from flagging.
And this is the latest bee that has
buzzed in the bonnet of Oakland's so
ciety maids and matrons. They took
it up as a hobby and rode it for all it
was worth during the six weeks" vaca
tion, but whether they would have tired
of it had it kept up at a steady clip is
more than one can tell. But this much
is certain, the club has never shown
the white feather and it would have
managed somehow or other to make
the neighborhood rise up and call it
blessed.
"waltin' to git In," and every now and
then some adventuresome Jane would
manage to rouse the entire neighbor
hood because she hung herself on a
picket and couldn't get down. Once in
side the building they were allowed to
compare notes and talk as much as
they pleased â provided, of course, they
didn't raise too much of a disturbance,

Is the most responsible of the evils can

tinued heavy diet, drinking large quan
tities of water at and between meals,
keeping the digestive organs in a dis
tended state, aggravated by ill-fitting
corsets which protrude, cr are too tight,
are part of the trouble. The tight cor
set holds the flesh more or less rigid
at all times, causing the muscles to
lose vitality and become soft and flab

the decayed spots are between the
teeth, near the gum, it indicates that
you are not as thorough as you should
be in cleaning between the teeth and
not that the' trouble is due to any
peculiarity of the teeth. Unless there
is a decided space between the teeth
the brush cannot reach and cleanse all
the crevices without aid in other forms
and under any circumstances a close
inspection of the teeth should follow
the brushing to determine its effective
ness. A leading dentist gives the fol r
lowing as a thorough âethod of clean-
Ing the teeth: Use a moderately stiff
brush and a simple dentifrice com
posed, of two ounces of precipitated
chalk and one-fourth ounce each of
powdered orris root and myrrh. Al
ways brush the teeth on both sides
and, after a crosswise, brushing treat^
them lengthwise, always finishing the
process by rinsing the mouth thorough
ly several times. Be particular that
eyery tooth has an equal share of the
brushing, for carelessness in this re
spect furnished the explanation why
defective teeth are most numerous on
handle, but ice cold with luscious pink
flesh scooped out in dainty oval pieces
or cut in neat squares and freed from
the seeds, served on a pretty plate
garnished with a spray of fern, is a
most refreshing | and attractive dish.
Another pretty method is to make a
low melon basket of the shell and fill
it with the chilled fruit. Cut off the
stem end of the melon, so it will set
firmly on a large dish, making the
handle on the opposite end. Remove
all the edible portion, pick out all the
seeds which can be reached without
breaking the fruit too much and set
on the ice to keep cold. When ready
to serve set the cold, crisp basket in
n, bed of cracked ice and ferns or any
obtainable greens, fill the basket with
the chilled fruit and serve at once.
Tall glasses filled with the fruit cut
in small pieces is a pretty and dainty
manner of serving iÂ«slons. Canta
loupes or musk melons, as they are
commonly called, should be scrubbed
thoroughly with a brush to free the

A LOTION FOR BLACKHEADS â
(R.M.B.). When the skin of the face is
disfigured with blackheads, even after
repeated scrubbings, the following will
be found useful in dispatching the
blemishes more rapidly, yet without in-
Jury to the most delicate skin. It is ob
vious that a skin food is not needed,
the skin being already overburdened,
hence the tiny plugs of hardened, se
bacous oil. A good cold cream, how
ever, is very helpful in cleansing and
softening the skin preparatory to press
ing out the blackheads, If It Is used as
directed, otherwise it may increase
rather than decrease the trouble. Wash
the face with a soft linen rag, using
plenty of hot water and soapâ a pure
blend article free from strong alkali
and- coloring matter is presupposed.
Then rub cold cream lightly over the
parts most affected and massage with
the finger tips in rotary .motion and
wtih a light pressure. After manipu
lating for five or ten minutes the skin
will be glowing warm and the clogged
pores softened from the combined
forces of water and massage, when the
worst blackheads may be easily pressed
out. Always protect the finger tips with
several folds of old linen to avoid bruis
ing the skin. Wash the face again
with the hot water to remove all cream
and then apply this lotion: Take one
dram each of zinc oxide and carbonate
of magnesia and four ounces of rose
water; mix, shake well and, dab on the
spots, pressing out more blackheads
after five minutes if you can do it with
out too much pressure. Then rinse the
face In two cold waters. Treat the face
before retiring and again in the morn
ing, when a thorough washing should
be followed by the lotion only, and then
with cold rinsings to close the pores.

ing color is an old rose, trimmed with
bits of variegated green. In all, there
are three roses which stand bravely
forth on straighter stems than ever
digniSed the proudest rose bush in the
land. The stems, which consist ot
three strands of rope silk, commence
perhaps a foot from the bottom of the
portiere and run to within two feet
of the top. The rose, of course, tops
it and adds its bit of color as well.
And now as to the rose itself. In the
first place it is absolutely square, with
a tiny nick taken out of the very
center of all four sides, which takes
away the block-like appearance. The
heavy rope silk, green, by the way. is
worked about this piece of applied
linen and serves a double purpose in
asmuch as it finishes the rough edge
and gives the third tone as well. Little
green scrolls in the rose resemble, it is
to be supposed, the stamens of the
flower and the rose in its entirety Is
completed.
The lower portion of the portiere is
trimmed In a very simple fashion.
Two bands of the rose, perhaps some
two or three inches In depth, are run
straight across from side to side and
on either side of the linen the green
Bilk makes Its effective rope and takes
away from the long straight up and
down effect.
There is absolutely nothing more to
this curtain, but It Is the smartest
thing one can buy in the line of
hangings. Its very simplicity adds to
its beauty, and the unique blending of
odd colors gives it a tone that is any
thing but common.
A favorite design is "Ye Night
Birds." They are a combination of
the weird and fantastic, and the three
outspread birds impress one with the
Idea that they are always just on the
eve of departure.
There are scores of queer patterns
â the poppy, the tulip and a multi
tude of others that must be labeled
or one would never dream what they
â¢were intended to represent- But, not
withstanding this peculiarity, they are
the only correct hangings for mission
styles and furnishings generally.
And now comes my secret. If one
can afford to walk into a shop and
coolly and calmly ask the designer to
look at a certain room and fit it up
according to a stated . period, all Is
very lovely and likewise very simple.
Next best comes in the ability to order
what one likes best of ready made fur
nishings, and really prices are not as
exorbitant as they used to be and the
economy bee does not buzz quite as
loudly and as Insistently.
Third choice is Just this: The fab
ric comes by the yard and can be fur
nished at but one shop in town. It is
full fifty Inches In width, which la
quite as wide as an ordinary portiere
and may be had in an endless variety
of colors. As to price it is inexpen
sive, pleasantly so in fact, for fab
rics generally run into a good many
dollars and do not always show their
value at that. However.- this canvas
costs between one and two dollars a
j-ard and may be had in any quantity.
To be sure it is not the easiest thing
in the world to turn out fit home pro
ducts, for the linen that is appllqued
generally has a changeable effect that
adds most decidedly, but there are
certain combinations that will make
the clever home designer as proud as
Punch. .
For instance, a simple effect that'is
Charming is the curtain utterly de
void of trimming and finished with a
double hemstitching. By the way, if
the curtain is a brown the silk used is
a yellow, bright enough to form a good
contrast, and as the hemstitching is
double and rather coarse in the bar
gain the finish is all that one could
wish for.
The same fabric makes splendid
covers for pillows and as the tones are
are never bright or glaring they always
blend nicely with anything that
chances to form a part of the cozy
corner.

THERE Is an old song, a very old
eong, the refrain of which runs
thus: " 'Twag merry In the hall,
when the beards wagged all, we
Â¦hell never see the like again, again!
We shall never see the like again!"
Whether there v.as anything particu
larly hilarious in the wagging of
beards, we may not feel able to de
termine, but there Is unquestionably a
vague sense something festive and
social conveyed in the quaint lines. We
feel, â¢without knowing why, that It was.
it must have been, "merry in the hall"
at the distant period alluded toâ while
at the .present time we are daily and
hourly made painfully aware that
whether It be in hall, drawing-room or
extensive "reception gallery," the mer
riment â¢ formerly so well sung and
spoken of exists no longer. The Harp
that once through Tara's Hallsâ no!â
I mean the beards that once wagged
in the hall wag no more. Honest
laughter Jias given place to the nanny
goat snig&ering bleat now common to
polite society, and understood to be the
elegantly trained' and "cultured" ex
pression of mirth. The warm hand
shake has. in a very great measure,
degenerated into the timorous offer of
two or three clammy fingers extended
dubiously, as with a fear of microbes."
And hospitality, large-hearted, smil
ing, gracious hospitality. Is dead and
vraptxaJ in its grave clothes, waiting
in stiff cor^e-like Btate for Its final
burial.
Public dinners, public functions of all
kindsâ in England at any rateâ are
merely so many funera.1 feasts In mem
ory of the great defunct virtue. It3
spirit has fledâ and there Is no calling
it back again. The art of entertaining
ia lostâ together with the art of con
versation. And when our so-called
"friends" are "at home" we are often
more anxious to find reasons for de
clining rather than for accepting their
invitations, simply because we know
that there Is no real "at home" in it,
but merely an "out-of-home" arrange
ment. In which a mixed crowd of peo
ple are asked to stand and swelter in
an uneasy crush on staircase and in
drawing-room, pretending to listen to
music which they can scarcely hear
and scrambling for tea which is gen
erally too badly made to drink. In
deed, it may be doubted whether of all
the various ludicrous social observ
ances in which our progressive day
takes part there is anything quite so
sublimely Idiotic as a smart "at home"
in London during the height of the
season. Nothing certainly presents
jnen and women in such a singularly
Unintelligent aspect. Their faces all
Â¦wear more or less the same expression
of forced amiabilityâ the same civil
grin distorts their poor mouthsâ the
tame wondering ~ and weary stare af
flicts their tired straining eyeballsâ
and theySame automatic arm-movement
and hapd-Jerk works every unit, as
each approaches the hostess in the con
ventional manner enjoined by the
usages of that "cultured" hypocrisy
which covers a multitude of lies. Sheep
herding In a field and cropping the
herbage in the comfortable uncon
sciousness that they are eating merely
to be eaten are often stated to be the
Billiest of animalsâ but whether they
are sillier than the human beings who
consent to be squashed together in
stuffy rooms where they can scarcely
move, under the sham impression that
they are "at home" with a friend, is a
matter open to question. Of course to
some minds It may be and no doubt is
extremely edifying to learn by the so
ciety papers that Mrs. So-and-So or
Lord and Lady Thlngemmy will "en
tertain a great deal this season." Peo
ple who have no idea what this kind
of "entertainins" means may have glit
tering visions thereon.
They may picture to themselves
scenes of brilliancy where "a thousand
hearts beat happily, and when music
arose with Its voluptuous swell soft
eyes looked love to eyes which spake
again, and all -went merry as a mar
riage bell'" Only these things do not
happen. Anything but love Is "looked"
from soft eyes and hard eyes equallyâ
derision, contempt. Indifference, de
jection, malice and (so far as cham
pagne. Ices and general messy feeding
are concerned) greed light up these
"windows of the soul" from time to
time during the progress of such fes
tivities; but love, never! The women
are far too busy finding standing room
wherein to show themselves and their
newest frocks off to advantage to
waste any moment In mere sentiment,
and it is a christianly beautiful sight
to see how the dear things who v wear
the dressmaker's latest "creations"
elbow and push and hustle and tread
on the toes of their sisters who are less
highly favored than themselves in the
matter of mere clothes. As for the men,
if they have, by dint of hard exertion,
managed to get into the "crush," and
near enough to the hostess to bow and
touch her hand, their sole attention'
henceforward becomes concentrated on
the business of getting out again as
rapidly as possible. For let It be said
to the praise, honor and glory of the
sterner eex that, taken in the rough
majority, they detest the fashionable
"at home," with vlgoro'-- and honest
intensityâ and unless- th<_ are of the
degenerate class who like to be seen
hanging around some notoriously press
puffed "professional beauty," or some
equally notoriously known leader of
the smart set, they are seldom seen at
such gatherings. They feel themselves
to be Incongruous and out of place â
and so they are. "At homes, are curi
ous sorts of social poultry-yards, where
the hens have it all their own way, and
do most distinctly crow.
But if "at homes" are bad enough,
the Em art, the very smart dinner party
is perhaps a little worse in its entire
lack of the true hospitality which,
united to CTace and tact and ready con
versation, should make every guest feel
that his or her presence Is valuable
and welcome. A small private dinner,
at which the company are some six or
eight persons at most, is sometimes
(though not by any means always),.
be impossible to forgetâ one of these
dinners which took place last season in
a very "swagger" houseâ the house of
a member of that old British nobility
whose forbears and titles always excite
a gentle flow of saliva in the mouths
of snobs. The' tablesâ there were two
âwere, to use the formal phrase, "laid
for forty covers"â that Is to 'say that
the otherâ and between-whiles a fine
string band discoursed the sweetest
music. But with it all there was no
real .hospitality. We might as well
have I been seated at some extra" lux
urious table d'hote In one of the "Kur"
houses of Austria or Germany, paying
so much per day for our entertain
ment. Any touch of warm and kind-
the mischief! For sad as it is to lack
heart in the entertaining of our friends,
it doubles the calamity to lack brain as
well! â¢ Our host was stupidâ dull to a
degree unimaginable by those who do
not know what some lordly British
aristocrats can be at their own tablesâ
our hostess, a beautiful woman, was
equally stupid, being entirely engrossed
either checked by waiters proffering
more food, or drowned in the musical
growling of the band! I believe one
man hazarded a Joke â but it was not
heard â and I know that a witty old
Irish peer told an anecdote which was
promptly "quashed" by a dish of as
paragus being thrust before him Just
as he was, In the richest brogue, arrlv-
THB modern theory of disease lays
much' stress on the disastrous
work of infinitesimal invisible
agencies which prey upon the
body. To their overthrow and entire
annihilation all the forces under the
command of physicians and scientists
are being devoted. It sometimes seems
as if there were in the realm of the In
tellectual and moral life certain little
pestilential microbes or bacilli or
germs, call them what you will, which
persist in fastening upon and worrying
us. They burrow their way down
through the ordinary protective armor
and fasten upon our very vitals. We
try to shake them off, but they stick.
There is no recourse then but to de
clare war and wage It to the bitter end.
Remorse in its various forms, regret,
repining, self -upbraiding is a terrible
microbe. How much nervous force we
lose In worrying over things we have
done or failed- to do, the opportunities
neglected and the opportunities squan
dered. How we retrace the ground in
our imagination and say, "Oh, why did
I. not take the other course instead of
the one I did choose?" Honest self-ex
amination and self-appraisal is whole
some, but to linger long in thought over
â¢the might-have-been is suicidal. Gen-
eral Gordon, the hero of Khartoum,
used to say when he had actually done
a thing he looked upon it not as an
isolated historical event, but as. a part
of the providential movement of his
life. From that point of view he could
bear even the remembrance of his mis
takes, because he believed that some
how In the providence of God they
might be made to yield valuable snlr-
itual fruitage and turn out to the pro
gress of truth and righteousness. So he
detached himself, so far as worry goes,
from his yesterdays.
And we all need to do this. To-day
has problems enough of its own As
Martin Luther said, "The best repent
ance is to do so no more." Pause
enough over your folly and sin to
name it as such and to seek forgive
ness, and then dismiss it altogether
and responded "I am so afraid that
when I grow up I shall get married
and have a baby and the baby will
die." Older people lose sleep and flesh
over hardly more probable or imme
diate contingencies. Don't worry clubs
have come up in different parts of the
land to fight this special - microbe but
you need not wait for any formal or
ganization. Start one under your. own
roof or In your own heart.
MICROBES
By the Parson
from your mind. Suffer it not to shad
ow to-day's Joys or to sap the strength
to be used for to-day's tasks.
Another baneful microbe is fear. It
is bred in the same pestilential swamp
with the bacillus called remorse but It
looks toward the future instead of the
past. A whimsical illustration of It Is
had in the little girl who was asked one
day why she was sobbing so bitterly
The man who has stamped out these
two microbes, care . and fear, has
doubled the valuation of his earthly
days, lengthened the probable duration
of his life, acquired an enviable dig
nity, poise and serenity of life and
multiplied manifold the efficiency of
his personality.
Religion, especially the Christian re
ligion, provides some specifics against
the inroads of these two microbes. It
emphasizes its doctrine of forgiveness,
â perhaps sometimes in the past it has
overemphasized it. But, putting aside
all fantastic and unmoral statements
of that doctrine, the fundamental
truth will remain that for the man
who has slipped and fallen provision
has been made not alone to put him
on his feet ajain, but to remove from
his consciousness the load of guilt and
throbbings or remorse.
And the Bible Is also full of admon
itions beginning "Fear not." In fact,
for the man who really . believes what
the Bible says, worry becomes an out
rage upon his God. Why, if we are all
the creatures of a loving, forgiving, re
sourceful Father and are trying to-day
to live as His children should, need we
worry over yesterday's shortcomings
or be afraid of what the morrow will
brine: forth?
quite a pleasant affair, but a "big"
dinner in the "bis" sense of the word
is generally the most painful and dis
mal of functions, except to those for
whom silent gorging and after-reple
tion are the essence of all mental and
physical Joy.
I rememberâ and of a truth it would
each table accommodated twenty
guests. The loveliest flowers, the most
priceless silver, the daintiest glass,
adorned the festive boardsâ everything
that taste could suggest or wealth sup
ply had Its share in the general effect
of design and color â the host was at
the head of one table, the hostess at
ly feeling was altogether lacking; and
to make matters worse, a heavy demon
brooded over the brave outward sho%v
of the feastâ a demon with sodden gray
wings that refused to rise and soar â
the demon of a hopeless, Irremediable
stupidity!
Out and alas!â here was the core of
with herself and her own bodily
charms, to the utter oblivion of the
ease and well being of her guests.

HOSPITALITY
ing at the "point." But as nobody lis
tened to him It did not matter. Nobddy
does listen to anybody or anything
nowadays at social functions. Every
body talks with insane, babbling ea
gerness, apparently indifferent as to
whether they are heard or not. Any
amount of people ask questions and
never think of waiting for the an
swers. Should any matters, small or
great, require explanation, scarce a
soul has the patience or courtesy to
attend to such explanation or follow it
with any lucidity or comprehension. It 1
is all hurry-skurry, helter-skelter and
badâ shockingly badâ manners.
I am given to understand that
Americans, and Americans alone, re
tain-and cherish, the old-fashioned
grace of hospitality, which Is so rap
idly becoming extinct in Great Britain.
I would fain believe this, but of my
self I do not know. I have had no
experience of social America, save
such as has been freely and cordially
taught me by Americans in London.
Some of these have indeed! proved that
they possess the art of entertaining
friends with real friendly delight in
the grace and charm and mutual help
of social intercourse; others, again, by
an Inordinate display of wealth and a
feverish yearning for the paragraph
man (or woman), have plainly shown
that hospitality Is, with them, a far
less concern than notoriety. However
this may be, no sane person will allow
that It la "hospitality" to ask a num
ber of friends Into your house and
there keep them all standing because
you have managed that there shall be
no room to sit down, while strong,
half-cold tea and stale confectionery
are hastily dispensed among them. It
Is not "hospitality" to ask people to
dinner and never speak a word to
them all evening because you, if a man,
are engaged upon your own little "bus
iness affair," or, if a woman, are anx
ious not to lose hold of your special
favorite male flatterer. If friends are
Invited they should surely be enter
tained In the manner friendly and mad*
to feel at home by the personal atten
tion of both the host and hostess. It
la not "hospitality" to turn them loose
In bewildered droves through grounds
or gardens, to listen to a band which
they have no doubt heard many times
before, or to pack them all Into &
stuffy room to be entertained by a
professional musician whom they could
hear to much more comfortable and
Independent advantages by paying for
Â¦tails at the legitimate concert hall.
What do we really mean by hosÂ«
pitallty? Surely we mean friendship,
kindness, personal interests and warm
hearted openness of look and conduct,
and all these are deplorably missing
from the "smart" functions of up-to
date society of London, whatever the
state of things may be concerning this
antique virtue in New York and Boston.
It would appear that the chief ingre
dients of hospitality are manners, for,
as Emerson says: "Manners are the
happy way of doing things." This
"happy way" is becoming very rare.
Society, particularly the "upper ten"
society, is becoming, quite noticeably,
very ruda. Some of the so-called
"smartest" women are notoriously very
vulgar. Honesty, simplicity, sympathy
and delicacy of feeling are. or seem to
be. aa much out of date as the dainty
poems of Robert Herxick, and the love
sonnets of Sir Philip Sidney. Time
goes on, say the Iconoclasts, and we
must go with Itâ we must, if our hur
rying civilization requires it, pass
friends by with a cool nod, mock at the
vices of the young and sneer at the
fallings of the old; we are all too busy
to be courteous, too much In a hurry
grabbing gold to be kind, and much
too occupied with ourselves to be
thoughtful of others. So let us bury
hospitality decently once and for all.
and talk no more about it. It was a
grand old virtue! â let us enter it with
honorâ and cease to hold our funeral
feasts and entertainments in its name.
For,' being dead, 'tis dead and dons
with, and amid all our miserable
twentieth-century shams, let us at
least drop, for shame, our base imi
tations of the great-souled splendid
grace that was meant to link our lives
more sweetly together, to engender
love, and to make home more home
like. For nowadays, few of ns are
6lmple and truthful enough In our lines
of conduct to even understand hos
pitality in its real meaning.
"Between simple and noble persons,**
says a great philosopher, "there Is al
ways a quick intelligence; they recog
nize at sight; and meet on & better
ground than the talents and skills they
may chance to possess, namely, on
sincerity and uprightness." Sincerity
and uprightness are the very fiber and
life-blood of true hospitality. But the
chief canon of modern society is hy
pocrisy to begin with. Insincerity and
lack of principle naturally follow, with
their usual accompaniment, moral
cowardice, and so men and women
sneak and crawl, and flatter base per
sons for what they can get, and re
ject all chances of faithful friendship
for mere ephemeral show. Under such
conditions as these, what can good old
hospitality do but draw Its last breath
with a gentle sigh of expiring sorrow
for the mistaken world which prefers
a He to a truth, and still to this day
crucifies all Its loving would-be re
deemers on miserable Calvarys of deso
lation! No happiness does It gain
thereby, but only Increased bitterness
and weariness, and that all our social
customs have greatly changed since
the old time when households were
wisely ruled and very simply ordered,
is no advantage to the general social
community. "We may, if we choose,
and we very often do so choose, fly
from one desire to another and thence
to satiety, and back again from satiety
to desire, but we shall never, in such
pursuit, find the peace engendered by
simplicity of life, or the love and last
ing Joy inspired by that honorable con
fidence In one another's best and
noblest attributes, which should frank
ly and openly set the seal on friend

to make the best of matters. As bad
luck would have It, his ancient and
capricious fancy was yesterday en
snared by some forward young person
whose acquaintance he made at the
railroad depot. She was there, it ap
pears, to meet a friend. He, fatigued
by his journey, was overcome by one
of his periodic fainting fits. This of
ficious young woman was equal to the
occasion. She objected to having an
ambulance ,. summoned. One of her
relatives, she said, was subject to just
such seizures, and she knew just what
to do. She had him laid flat, hlÂ» col
lar loosened, begged a fiask from a
drummer and dispatched, a messenger
to a drugr store for what proved to be
the proper tablets. Anyhow, she
brought him back to consciousness, had
him lean on her arm to the cab stand,
and saw him safely oft to his chosen
hotel. She would not give her name â
only laughed away his thanks and
went off.
"He has talked of nothing else since.

Ray stopped to address a question
to. the big Irish setter lying on the

had promised to .do?" ;; '-;.'*."S
Whereat Pickwick, sagacious and

I had failed to keep her appointment
j with him the day previous? The
! thought troubled her. She could not
bear to remain indoors and eat her
breakfast. She would run out in the
garden and wait until the postman
passed. She had her plunge bath,
dressed and went flying downstairs.
"Good morning!" she cried smiling
ly. She caught eagerly the letter he
extended. At first, as she read a
shadow crossed her countenance.
Gradually this expression gave place
to one of bewilderment. Finally It was
merged' in a look of complete compre
hension.
"Robert won't be angry about the
broken appointment," she decided.
This is the letter Robert wrote:

parted.' Well, it's the only fun I'll ever
get out of It."
Then he went down the roa4 toward
the city, alone. '.
"Have you ever loved any man?
Ever truly loved?" ha asked without
heeding her.
In her heart arose the vision of a
pair of faithful, gentle eyes that had
sought hers on the plaza, and a form
that bent over ths guitar at twilight.
She burst into tears. "Oh. yes," she
moaned. "Raphael, dear Raphael!"
The carriage stopped. ' - The lover
climbed out. then leaning on the win
dow ledge, he whispered: "If you are
wise, keep still."
And she obeyed. The horse stirred,
the coachman dozed, and the time
grew long. Then the night quiet was
broken by the twangy voice -,ot the
American, mingled with the soft tone3
of her native tongue. The carriage
door opened and there before her stood
Raphael.
"Now." said the American. "If you
want to go home I'll take you back.
If you want to go with your lover, go."
For answer she threw herself Into
Raphael's arms, and caste and proprie
ty were forgotten in the bll3S of a first
kis=! of love gratified.â
"Here's a purse for you and your
girl. Raphael. Hope you'll like married
life."
"Senorita. I have loved many beauti
ful ladies. I am â bah!" â lj.? seemed to
be talking to himselfâ "tired of It all."
"Tired of . love?" A cold hand
knocked at the door of heV heart. The
carriage was on a lonely, white country
road now.
"Senorita. I cannot â I â er â well, you
see, I cannot marry youâ I â " .
' "Holy mother!" the girl cried, cross-
Ins herself and feeling for her rosary.
"You cannot marry me? Then why did
you bring me here?" . , - .. â¢
"Wait, senorita: do you love me?"
She was dazed by the sudden, prac
tical question: then she shuddered and
answered: "No, I hate youâ I hate
you. senor. Oh. take me back to my
mother â take me home." Â¦
A victoria sp?d away from the house.
"Senorita," that was the first word
her strange lover had spoken. He no-v
leaned forward in the darkness. "Se
norita, are you afraid?"
His graze was cold and steady.
"No â o â o, senor. But why are -yea
bo â so still? You do not love me?"
Her voice shook.
She was beautiful and good as the
Holy Mother. He had had no glimpse
of her sir.ee, except from behfnd the
bars of her window. He could neither
eat nor sleep.
The American turned away, while his
lips curled unpleasantly. Raphael
amused him. He was an exceptional
Spaniard. He had scrape^ together a
kind of education for himsaif, and was
something of a genfna in music. Un
der more favorable conditions he might
have made a way for himself in the
world.
The cynicism faded from the Amer
ican s eye as he asked where the seno
rita lived and who her family were.

Anita lay asleep. The moonlight
came through the roses at the window
and all was still. Suddenly, through
the darkness came a single sweet not*Â».
The girl sat up to listen. She pushed
back her hair and listened agajn. Her
eyes shone, her cheeks Hushed and her
little heart beat fast. She stole to the
window, holding her mantilla closÂ«?
about her chin. Beneath the orange
tree stood a man. Her heart fluttered
faster, and the hot southern passion
shone In her eyes. It -was the rich
Senor Americano. â¢ â¢
"Senorita."
This was going beyond the bounds
of the serenading lover, but Anita lean
ed out and waited.
"Senorita."
"Senor. I am here," whispered the
girl, and then drew back coyly.
"Fair one, listen." Then he poured
into her ears a tale cf love. ! ...
"One," said he, "loves the senorita
â loves thee -unto deathâ but he can
not marry thee In this country- Â¦ Will
you leave sunny Mexico anfd so to
America with your loverâ us ' his
wife?"
She drew back and shivered a little,
but the dimples played In her cheeka.
Anita must love and be loved, and
would make a good, true little wifa
for any man who would only love her
enough.
"Senor," she leaned far out into
the silver night, pulled a rose and
threw It down to him. "Senor. when?"
He picked up the flower, kissed it
and pressed it to his heart. He was so
coldly, artificially Mexican. It fright
ened and attracted her.
"Now," he answered. "Now, Anita;
will you come with me no*.v?"
The realization came to her like a
shock. Leave her father and mother?
Go with this man? To America? LovÂ«
and romance were her guidins- stars
poor little soul. Yes, she' would go.
"In two minutes, senor." sha whis
pered.
-By Edna Manners
fTNHE haze or the semi-tropics was
â¢I everywhere, blending the gorge-
I ous tints of hills and valleys In
JL its elusive veil. There were tears
In the Mexican's eyes as be sang
to his tinkling guitar, and his notes
were laden with crief. He looked- up
from beneath his sombrero, his black
eyea showing the clear white beneath.
"What's the matter?" came in a for
eign voice, and he glanced up to see
the American miner looking down on
aim. There, was something unpleasant
in the American's eye that held people
aloof and made them speak with re-
Etrairtt when he was near. Ra PÂ£f el
stopped playing, covered his face isltn
his hands and sobbed aloud.
"Buck up. friend." the American
cried; then added In Spanish, "What s
wrong. anyhow?" Raphael grew
calmer. He stood up and leaned on ma
guitar, looking toward the humble
home where his little brothers and sis
ters were at play.
"Oh, senor," he cried in confiding
dejection, 'tis the beautiful Senorita
Anita. Senor, they have shut her up
and I shall never see her any more.
I die of love of her." -;> >"
"No, you won't," muttered the Amer
ican, turning away to mde a cynical
gleam. The dam of Raphael's grief
was loosened, and the contents of his
soul poured into listening ears. And
this was the tale he told: He loved
the Senorita Anitaâ a bewitching dam
sel far above himâ was dying of love
for her. Many times they had met on
the plaza, and she had glanced shyly
from beneath her mantilla and smiled
at himâ yes, he could swear she smiled.
A
FOOL AND HIS MONEY
'' ry IOVANNI DEL PRATO. grand
{Â¦ I son of eld Marie, stood at tht
, \\X crossing and waved the little red
"^^ flag which warned travelers and
'* . chauffeurs that an excavation
â¢ lay just bc-rond. The excavation had
i>een a source of annoyance to the great
â¢city for many months, but Giovanni
had prayed That it might never be filled
in-â first, because so lor.g as he waved
the 'little red t'.ag he would draw one
. dollar a day â and, then, had come the
â¢â¢'Princess.
â¢ To be sure, back in sunny Italy he
had dreamed of different things. He
. had no conception of the noisy, shriek
*' ing city (Those streets were Althy by ,
â¢comparison with the hard, white roads
if his Neapolitan home. He had
* dreamed of cities paved in gold, and of
a people who r^-id '^io prices to lads
.vith good voicts, but lie had found the
/ v jpera season dosed and his grand
tnotner skeptic*! of the commercial
value' of trcsh untrained voices. She
had. been Â»:: America nve years, and of
the little red nag and the dollar a day,
â¢the was sure.
Even of the Princess he at times felt
a bit uscsrtdin, lor he thought it odd
'. that a PrtabtttS should walk by his
.corner evt-ty ii.ornmg with a portfolio
" â¢ under her at m. There were other
.young: men. vei&trU in American
.ways. Vkhu thought the frincess
. thould not valk end carry a portfolio,
- but the Prir.Lt.bs would not ride in their
: carriages nur atlow them to carry her
* portfolio, fcht had gone iz for art, and
;. the y<j ung Deo iuieriered witb the real
; Nation of her ambition.
" In Giovanni's mind, however, there
vas no question about her royal blood.
â¢ It showed in her caiiiuys. in her patri
cian features r.-r proudly carried
. littk: head; in the .... ut the wonderful
gray. gown the a.i..cya wok, and in the
*" violets at her i,.it. m timÂ«= the young
" Italian was gl~~ .hat she did not ride
* in acarriagt-, trls.^ it had not been given
Â£o him to see tr.~i :-he got safely across
â¢;he^trett on his tide cl the tracks, and
â¢ to turn her over to the more stalwart
'..policeman on Uj<. other gide.
Giuvanni did not tell his grandmother
abou-t the Pnncetsa. O!d Marie ran a
.boaxding-houst tur Italian workmen
.and constant intercourse with these men
and the Etrugg.e to git her board
money each week hau rather killed
sentiment, but under h~r vehement
." lau'lt finding her love for Giovanni
' burned clearly and steadily.
Spring came and the Academy
closed, much to the regret of Kate
' Cameron, ctherwitc th^ Princess. She
"was just becoming interested in paint
ing .from life, su she persuaded her
.' lather to fit up a little eiudio in the
â¢" ' attic of their town house, though she,
knew full well that in less than a
month the whole family would flit to
' their country place. One of the pro
â¢ fesscrs at the Academy agreed to call
â¢ occaskmaliy and criticise her work, and
. "there remained only the Question of
â¢* models. A half-dozen young men. who
beard her talk about it at a fashiona
: bte tea, immediately offered to act in
this capacity, but she laughed aside
their suggestions. They were sadly
â¢. lacking in th2 artistic temperament, she
Â¦aid.
"â¢ ' The very next morning she stopped
. -fit Giovanni's crossing- He had not
â¢ seen her for nearly a week, and he
"was glad that a broken dray barred
â¢the' passage of both vehicles and pe
destrians. The Princess carried no
"â¢-â¢portfolio this morning, but a little eil
; "ver-mouned memorandum book, filled
with the addresses of models. When
she saw Giovanni she lost interest In
â¢ the memorandum book- She had no
ticed him before as a graceful, lithe
j . lad despite his rough garments, and
â¢cot.' his eyes, glowing with delight at
â¢sight of her. his beautiful white teeth
showing he and the graceful
."gesture r.-ith which Â¦ he continued to
wave the nap, despite the fact that ve
hicles couiu j either come nor go, caught
. and held bei Interest.
Being a young woman of impulse,
ehe then and th<-re asked him to pose
â¢for her. <Jiuvar:r.i said '"Sure," one of
Â¦Â¦ thfrfew American by- words he "had
.- picked m>. ar:d said it so softly that
it becarr.-: almost a verbal caress. His
, -voice was the last touch. Miss Cam
eron was ture now that no othtr model
would ilo. but unfortunately Giovanni
bad not understood a word she had
said. l!e would have said "sure" to
any request the Princess made of him,
â¢ and this much he had gathered from
her wordsâ the Princess had n^ed of
. him and his services. The girl looked
puzzled, and a fellow workman, who
understood both Italian and English,
stepped forward and offered to act as
interpreter. The young lady desired
the sen-ices of Giovanni at her home
the following day. Giovanni regarded
it as a royal command, but, alas: there
â¢ were his grandmother and the Inexora
ble "Job."
S '. Then suddenly his face brightened.
Two days i?iore and there would be a
. fete day (what you call it â Decoration
" day?) and there would be no work on
the streets nor anywhere in the preat
city. Would that suit Her Excellency
as well? Th* Princess graciously as
sented. Thf> interpreter took the ad
dress and th*Â» interview was over.
After the girl had gone, the inter
preter, in fluent Italian, informed Gio
vanni thi.t ho was a lucky dos. The
. young lady had agreed to pay him for
the day's woik five tim?s as much as
he earned waving the flag. "A good
.day's work." said the Italian, as he
turned away. But Giovanni looked
"after him scornfully. The fete day was
a man's own. and the little grand
mother would not expect even the dol
lar from him.
The great day dawned, and Giovanni.
In the velvet suit he had brought from
his Neapolitan home, arrived at the
beautiful mansion on the avenue. The
Pxlncess had laid out a wealth of
.draperies gathered during her last trip
abroad, but when she saw the bov in
simple costume she forgot studied
f/ effects and could hardly wait until "She
posed him on the little platform. It
was for Gicvar.ni, indeed, a fete flay,
for the two young people managed to
understand each other, and Giovanni
mellowed and glowed under the eirl's
charm of manner as he had never done
. since h*> came to America. Then long
before he was tired came a senrant
with a cooling drink. Ices and cakes
ânot Euch as they had orÂ» fete days at
nom<\ but, nevertheless, most delicious
â¢ âand when the evening shadows
lengthened, and the young girl at last
wearied, Giovanni understood that the
audience was over. She offered him one
cf those crisp green bills which rep
resented almost a week's work at the
crossing, but Giovanni, .drawing him
relf up proudly, declined It. Some
how the girl understood the motive
Giovanni stirred. The Princess saw
the movement first and bent over him.
In returning consciousness It seemed
to Giovanni as if he must have waked
up in heaven. "Princess," he mur
mured, and the wonderful glow came
into his eyes again. ; Impulsively the
girl bent over and kissed him.
He felt as If he were floating In the
air, but It was not because the Princess
had kissed him. He remembered the
fallâ the blowâ and he looked inquiring
ly from one to the other. His grand
mother burst into tears, and "wails in
her native tongue fell from her lips.
Giovanni turned from her to the Prin
cess. The girl's eyes were dim with
tears. Then it must be true, and Just
down, down, and then â night.
They stood arourd his cot in thÂ»
hospital, the girl refusing to rest or
leave him for an instant, "He might
wake â first," she said with a catch of
her breath, "and : I must speak to
him." ' ~
more to the crossing and the heat blis
tered the streets and burned into Gio
vanni's very heart- But the flaj?
waved mechanically and the memory
of the fete day came to- him occasional
ly like a breath of fresh air, but it was
not to be talked of, because no one
else would believe, that she-was really
a. Princess. Then came the day of the
flre in the great office building "a
block away. And on that day It so
happened that the Princess had come
to town to meet friends. She was
crossing the city in a hansom, reach
ing Giovanni's corner simultaneously
with the arrival of the fire engines.
Giovanni was "first to see that her
driver had lost control of his horse,
and that it was plunglnp straight to
ward the excavation. The policeman
on the other side of the street was
having his own troubles. A slender,
gray-clad figure seemed to rise sud
denly and leap out of the hansom.
There were curses from the driver and
/bewildering shouts all around him,
but the boy saw only the gray figure,
and somehow he caught it In his
arms. He felt himself going down,
The Sister, who spoke Italian, ex
plained to him that the big:, square
shouldered man who had written his
name on the Ions, slender piece of pa
per taken from the book was the father
of the Princess, and the. little slip of
paper meant that the old grandmother
would no longer keep boarders, but
could go back to Naples a rich woman
as wealth counted among their people.
The boy did not seem to hear. He was
looking into the face of the Princess.
There were tears in her beautiful eyes
âbecause he was dying.
They led the girl away. The old grand
mother, the piece of green paper with
Its -wonderful characters crumpled in
her hand, knelt beside the cot. The
doctor, who had watched the boy's face
In those last moments, turned to the
priest.
"The gods were good to the boy."
' And the priest, who had also watched
the glow on the boy's face and who
knew many phases of the Italian na
ture, crossed himself and said:
"The great God is always good to his
children."

THESE are the names of the lucky
guessers la the dressmaking
term puzzle contest of July 31.
Those puzzles seemed easy
enough, but from the way the answers
come In there must have been a rub
somewhere. Many of those who have
been regular guessers failed to send In
answers at all, which is a sure Indica
tion thct things -were not satisfactory.
It happens occasionally that the
genius who originates the puzzle pic
tures gets tired of his job and throws
in an ' added twist for spite. That's
what he did this w^ek, any way, when
he made the second picture "night
b!oomir.g cereus." which is certainly
new to most of us. There's another
twister In "jonquil," a flower which
doesn't grow in many pf our back
vards. - With these hints the Puzzle
Editor -hopes to see the old guard to
the fore again.

Issued an imperial decree declaring the
marriage of the Grand Duke to be null
and ' vivid, but he was afterward In
duced "to withdraw this decree by the
intervention of the Grand Duke of
Luxembourg, an uncle of the bride,
and of the Queen of Sweden, her aunt.
The Grand Duke of Luxembourg con
ferred'on the bride the title of Coun
tess" Torby. Grand Duke . Michael
Michaelovltch ; and his morganatic but
legitimate wife, Countess Torby, are
most popular members of fashionable
society in ' England [ and ' France. King
Edward 'Â¦ is their close friend and has
often visited them at their beautiful
country estate in England. He has re
peatedly endeavored to bring about a
reconciliation' between th^e Czar and the
Grand Duke and he has been partially
successful;' for Michael Michaelovitch
was; recently reinstated in the military
away on a foreign tour to forget his
folly.'
Almost the first place at which the
Grand Duke stopped on this tour was
Wiesbaden, where ho became involved
in another romantic love affair. He
was walking near Wiesbaden when a
horse ctime rushing toward him bear
ing on its back a woman who had lost
all control over the animal and who
was in imminent danger of death. The
Grand Duke placed himself In frc/nt of
the runaway .horse and at the risk of
his own life seized the reins and, after
being. dragged for a distance, succeed
ed In bringing it to a standstill. The
lady whom he ' thus rescued was the
young and ' beautiful daughter of
Countess\ Natalie Meremberg, the
morganatic wife of Prince Nicolas of
Nassau,' a brother of the reigning
Grand ' Duke of Luxembourg. Within
a week or two the Grand Duke made
thei young Countess Meremberg his
wife: '
Quite. by chance she attracted the
attention of the Grand Duko Paul
when she was walking in the street
and his Imperial Highness made In
quiries regarding the identity of the
beautiful, fascinating, stylishly dress
ed lady. He contrived to secure an
introduction to her in a none too con- J
ventional way and soon the 42-year
old widower was so desperately .in
love that: he was determined to make
Madame Vaierlanovna his wife at. all
costs. He communicated his inten
tion to the Czar, who threatened him
with the usual list of dire penalties if
he persisted . in his intention. Grand
Duke Paiil ! left Russia and took Ma
dame Valerianovna to Livorno, in
Italy, where he was wedded- to her
according to all the rites of the or-'
thodox Greek church" Â¦ \>y a priest
whom he brought with him to per

Czar's resDonse was a decree expell

POUR OF RUSSIA'S PERSONIFIED LUXURIES.
One of the; Czar's uncles,; .Grand
Duke Paul Alexandrayitch, has been
in exile tv.o years because he con
tracted a marriage*. In 5 opposition, to
the Imperial, wishes. Grand Duke
Paul was a widower and 42 years of
age when he married a second time,
ia 1902. The lady of his choice was
37 years old and. had . had a: varied
career. Her maiden name was Kar
novitch, and she was the daughter of
a prosperous lawyer Jn St.. Petersburg.
She .was a girl of striking beauty and
manifold fascinations, and. at the age
of 21 she becamethe wife of a mid
dle-aged, engineer, named Pistolkovs,
who was more _than twenty years hei>
senior. ' .This marriage' was evidently
a failure, for after three years a div
vorce was granted /arid Madame Pis
tolkovs soon afterward became, ' Ma
dame Valerianovna, : the : wife V of : a
landowner- in the province, of ' Volhy-c
nia, ' She left St. Petersburg for some
Grand Duke Paul's Love Story.
It, remains to be' seen whether Cy
ril has been obliged to renounce his
right of succession in order to marry
the woman of his choice. If he does
not renounce his rights and bring*.
Melita to St. Petersburg as the wife

a piquant situation will be. created.
The present Czarina is the. sister or
the Grand Duke of Hesse and shs
would hardly welcome her formed
sister-in-law as the wife of her; hus
band's possible future successpr.
However* this may-be; Cyril's pluck
and uncpnventionaiity and the deter
mination with which he .is > carrying
his romantic love affair make him the
most interesting' and sympathetic fig
ure among the grand dukes of Rus
sia. '^\ : r:\,!:-. Â¦
This formidable array of . threats
appears to have alarmed Cyril and
Melita, for the idea of . marriage, was
dropped for a time. When the war
with Japan broke out, Cyril hastened
to the front to do his duty as a naval
officer and was aboard the Petropav
lovsk when that battleship was tor
pedoed and sunk with nearly all
hands. Cyril returned to St. Peters
burg w'th a halo of martial glory
round his grand ducal head and seiz*
ed the opportunity, to renew, his ap
plication, to marry- Melita. The Czar
appears to have. conceded what he re
fused before; at any rate, Cyril had
not been in St. j Petersburg twenty
four hours before he rushed off to
see Melita at Coburg. It was then
announced that Melita had notified
her former husband that she will no
longer accebt his annual allowance
of $200,000. It was further an
nounced that the. marriage of. Cyril
and Melita will take place before ths
end of this year.
declare the marriage to be invalid In
Russia; secondly, .degrade Cyril from
his rank as an officer; thirdly, confis
cate all his estates; fourthly, banish
him from Russia forever, and, fifthly,
deprive him of his right of succession
to the Russian throne.
Grand Duke Cyril had made no secret
of his admiration for the Grand Duchess
Melita before her divorce, and no soon
er had she left her husband's home and
gone back to live with\her mother at
Coburg than Cyril made her a formal
offer of marriage. This was accepted
conditional on the Czar's consent,
which, however, was. emphatically re
fused. Grand Duke Cyril was given to
understand that he would.be commit
ting an inexcusable folly if he married
the divorced Grand Duchess of Hesse.
First of all, she is his cousin of the
first degree, his father and her mother
being brother and sister, and marriage
between such near relatives Is contrary
to. the laws of the orthodox state
church in Russia. The orthodox Greek
church, moreover, like the' Roman
Catholic church, regards marriage as
indissoluble and prohibits the second
union of a divorced man or woman.'
A Grand Duke. who married in direct
opposition to fundamental principles of
the orthodox state church would out
rage the feelings of the bigoted millions
of Russia and "Would Inevitably weaken
the authority' of the imperial house.
The committal of this error by a Grand
Duke who stands so near,to the throne
would be suicidal from a dynastic view
point. Grand Duke Cyril was therefor*
informed that If he persisted 'in marry
ing Melita the Czar would, first of all.
Now the Grand Duke is anxious to
marry the divorced Grand Duchess of
Hesse, who before her marriage was
Princess Melita of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha,
niece of King Edward of Great Britain.
Princess Melita was married to the
Grand Duke of Hesse when she was
only 17 years of age, and the match
was a failure. The Hessian Grand
Duke Is a cold, serious man, who is as
high-principled and conscientious as he
is uninteresting. Melita is gay, uncon
ventional and overflowing with life and
spirits. When the Grand Duke wanted
his wife, not yet out of her teens, to be
a mother to his people, to visit the sick
in the hospitals and to superintend the
soup kitchens for the destitute. Melita
preferred hunting, riding and â¢ other
kinds of healthy amusement. Truth
makes it necessary to record the fact
that she preferred the company of
dashing young officers of the Hessian
families of nobility to the dry old fos
sils of both sexes who were her hus
band's courtiers. Trouble arose and in
creased from incompatibility of tem
perament. After seven years of mar
riage a divorce was pronounced In De
cember. 1901". The Grand Duke of Hesse
agreed to pay his divorced wife ah an
nual allowance of $200,000, and their
only daughter was to spend half the
year with each parent. ,
ALL SORTS OF OBSTACLES.
Duke Cyril's matrimonial intentions
possess a special Importance, owing to
a possibility of succession to the
throne. At the present moment four
lives stand between him and the
crown â those of the Czar, the newly
born Czarevitch (heir apparent), the
Czar's brother and Cyril's own father,
Grand Duke Vladimir. /. .= <:, Â¦:â¢;â¢/':
- Another Uncle of the Czar, the Grand
Duke Alexis, got into trouble when a
young man by marrying one of the
ladies-in-waiting of his mother, the
Empress Maria Alexandrovna, The
bride was a Miss Joukoftsky and the
young couple contrived to keep their
marriage secret for three years. When
the secret became known the Czar was
extremely angry and took prompt
steps to put an end to the romantic
union. He declared the marriage to
be i null and void and expelled Miss
Joukoffsky from Russia forever. The
priest who celebrated the marriage ser
vice was, banished to Siberia for thirty
years and died in the eighteenth year
of his exile. Miss Joukoffsky after
ward' married a German Baron and
died recently on her husband's estate
in Saxony. The only child which she
bore the Grand Duke remained in his
father's custody and the Czar subse
quently conferred on him the title of
Count Belowsky." The youthful esca

otherwise keeping himself prominently
before royalty, he not only obtained
promotion, but has earned for himself
the sobriquet of "The King Fisher."
But the Kins himself is often the
author of the nicknames that are at

dubbed by the King the "Kaffir Circus"
because all the South African magnate?

there. For some unexplained reason
three stone statues were set on top of
the wonderful house which the ill-fate<i
Barney Barnato built for himself in
Park Lane and which is now Inhabited

King called "the petrified share

Russia, fbr each of them receives as
his birthright an income of one million

his death. The present sum paid to the
Grand Dukes and Princes of the Rus

i"tal of 516,000.000 per annum.
As a matter of fact, however, the
Grand Dukes have no need whatever of
feeding on public taxes, for in the
"<*>urse of time, like most other Imperial
and royal families, they have contrived
j|Â£tojaccumu!ate Immense estates all over
'the country*. Between them, these
â¢.thirty-three Grand Dukes and Princes
of the Russian imperial house own 5000
square miles of land, or about one-for

DISCUSS PLANS TO CROSS
THE OCEAN IN BALLOONS
British Aeronautical Society Considers
Plans of JIaklns Long
Aerial Trips. "
LONDON, Aug. 13.â Members of the
Aeronautical Society gravely discussed;
the possibilities of crossing the Atlantia
by balloon, while General Baden-
Powell sat in the chair and talked of
the value of kites in making meteoro
logical observations.
Charles Harding said Walter Powell.
M. P., who was killed in a balloon ac
cident in 1SS1, desired to cross the At
lantic from this side, but he himself
thought the wind was better the other
way.
Another member thought the notion
of starting from England should not bo
abandoned, but Mr. .Harding hoped
aeronauts would not risk their necks.
Albaugh's Mexican accent He owned
to having tried to strengthen it with
tamales. Pulque had also been recom
mended. Did I think It would improve
it? Honestly, what was my opinion?"
"I think it must be correct," I grant
ed, "because it is like Dorothy Donnel
ly's In 'A Soldier of Fortune.' "
Mr. Albaugh groaned and Miss May
laughed: "You should have seen
Grantâ"
"Mr. Stewart?"
"H'm!" she nodded, and repeated,
"You should have seen Grant when we
were rehearsing-. Mr. Albaugh would
say desperately: 'How is this accent,
Grant?' Poor fellow, he'd been holding
up Portuguese and all sorts of people
for it. Grant would look wise"â Olive
May's attempt to "look wise" was the
funniest thing she did â "and say,
â¢That's all right, Jack.' " she was fin
gering a round chin and frowning In a
screamingly ponderous fashion.
I developed giggles myself. So would

carnate giggle. Her very hair seem3
to laugh. And I can answer for four
white wisdom teeth where the laugh
Fhould endâ if it ever ended. Even Miss
May's prettiest of figures chirps the
same tale â "laugh and grow fat."
"Mr. Albaugh took the part at very
short notice?" I tried to say, but suc
ceeded only in snickering. "But haven't
I heard something about the gentle
man's life being saved by his engage
ment with you?"
"Really, yes," Mr. Albaugh Interpo
lated, "at least "
"But I know I did," Miss May cried,
with a childlike swagger.
"How did it happen?" I asked.
"I was at the club one day and Just
about to leave for Brooklyn," the un
grateful salvage related, "when, a
wildly hysterical note was brought to
me, running something like this: 'Dear
Mr. Albaugh â I need your assistance
Immediately and most dlrefully. Yours,
Olive May.' "
" 'Wildly hysterical/ Indeed!" Miss
Olive objected.
"I thought it was a Joke at first,"
the gentleman pursued, "and I hadn't
the least thought of going. Then I
thought it might be what it purported
to be and went. If I hadn't gone, I
should have been in a railway smash
up, in which there were twenjty-flve
people injured and one man killed.
And who knows?"
"There now," Miss May's tone be
spoke arcadian satisfaction. She looked
over at Mr. Albaughâ well, rather
nicely. He looked back at herâ It wag
perhaps because his chair was lower
than hers that his up-Iook seemed â
well, .rather worshipful.
"But ho saved your life, too," I re
minded her.
"He! he! he! Yes!" the actress
owned. "We call ourselves the mutual
life saving company."
"What were you doing before?" I
asked Mr. Albaugh.
Miss May replied: "Oh. he was a very
big person. He's been a manager. And
he was acting in a playlet written by
himself. 'Trenton.' "
"Ah," I commented, and asked, "And
what did you manage, Mr. Albaugh?"
"My father's theaters in Washington
and Baltimore," the gentleman mod
estly put it.
"He had a stock company." Miss May
put in.
"And did you take part?"
"I played Juvenile leads," the actor
On Sunday last I saw "A Girl From
Kansas" at the Orpheum. That is
why I went to see Miss Olive May on
Monday â not to speak of hearing her.
I had fallen In love with her giggle,
with her laugh, with her superb cheer
fulness. I was besides not a little im
pressed by Miss May's spirited and
â¢rraceful comedy. It was the giggle
that held me by the ear, however,
â¢Â£uch a rich, sudden tinkle of so
prano honey! Again, such a young,
liny, ridiculously pretty pipe â like
ar lost but cheerful chick! I wanted
to see if behind the scenes life
for Miss May was one long, sweet gig
gle. Or, whether like the lugubrious
Ed Stevens, she would spare me three
pale smiles to a chat.
The curtain-raiser was promising. A
j>rompt "Come in," answered my
knock at the May door and a sudden
picture of round, rosy cheeks, laugh-
Ing blue eyes, and sunny hair flashed
on me as I opened It. The not tall.
clean-cut, dark person, who seemed
to be doing a bit of amateur car
pentering at the Hay trunk, I recog
nized as Mr. Albaugh. who makes love
to Miss May In the play. In the play,
you know, the Kansas girl promises
the adoring Mexican a "square meal"
when he asks for her hand â he has
been the innocent cause of depriving
her cf a much desired breakfast. Out
of it â well, I shouldn't wonder if one
of Mr. Albaugh's preferences was for
olives!" Mine is.
"So glad you liked our little play
last night," Miss May beamed, and
Mr. Albaugh echoed. He is "John
W." besides.
. "I did like It thoroughly," I agreed.
"I liked its novelty. Its brightness â -
and very much its acting."
â¢'â¢"Oh, thank you!" ah! there was the
giggle. "Don't go, Jack .'

Albaugh. I liked the quiet, dark,

elected to "stay and talk."
I asked the photographer to "take"
him as well as Miss May. Mr. Albaugh
''wished the photographer would 'take*
his cold."
"He's had one ever since we came
here," Miss May said, seating herself
against a sage green wall that immedi
ately became a noble background. "Is
It always like this here â so cold and
foggy?"
"No, indeed," I said. "In August,

lady.
"So it is," I owned, "I meant Sep

(this to the photographer.) "Long time

leased her after a four-second ex

"Where ought one to go?" Mr. Al
baugh asked; "I'm not going to let this

"Really, Jack!" Miss May caroled.

that excellent Bohemian, Matias, as
host for their desired Mexican dinner.

between us we've covered lots of terrl-
tory â eh?"
The lady nodded.
"?" from me.
"I was the original Bonita in 'Ari
zona,' " Miss May replied. "That was
the longest part I ever played. Played
It In London, too. by the way."
Which reminds me that there is much
"by the way" with Miss May. She was
Invited to shake the royal fists of King
Edward and the English Queen, be
cause their owners were so pleased
with her Bonita. She is the daughter
of Colonel Mayâ by the wayâ and sis
ter, cousin, niece and granddaughter of
a whole regiment of statesmen and
such. Her Mays came over â NOT in
the Mayflower, but round about 1640,
and were all "rattling good Americans."
She didn't tell me this during the talk.
She wears neither her dramatic nor
other accomplishments on her sleeve.
It was in an aside after I went In to
see "A Girl From Kansas" for a second
time that they bobbed up carelessly.
And, by the way, as Miss May would
say, "A Girl From Kansas" bears sec
ond seeing better than most.
Then to Miss May's "Arizona" Mr.
Albaugh began to add other territory
covered by the "team."
" 'Arizona,' 'Colorado'â both Gus
Thomas plays, curious coincidenceâ and
now 'A Girl From Kansas,' with Its
scene in Mexico," quoth he. "what's the
matter with us for wild Westerners ?"
" 'Colorado' Is the play in which the
whole cast and part of the audience
gets shot, isn't it?" I asked.
"No they don't," said the actor. "We
were talking about that only the other
day, weren't we?"
The other half of "we" smiled af
firmation.
"There are really only two shots fired
in the plav," the actor protested, "but
the cartoonists had the dead all over
the shop."
"And you played 'Arizona' in Lon
don?" I turned back the talk a page or
two. "Did you like Londou?"
"Wouldn't want to live there," Miss
May owned.
"Yet they are very kind if they once
like youâ"
"And that's where New York isn't,"
the actress sighed. "You have to make
a hit with every part â "
"Still, artistically, that is perhaps
betterâ"
"No, it Isn't," Miss May contradicted,
still serious. "One may get a bad part,
you know." '
She supplemented then: "You may
find â for you simply cannot tell un
til you try it on the public â that ' you
are conveying an almost exactly oppo
site, or" â a thoughtful moment â "a
quite different impression from the one
you "believe yourself to be conveying."
"In which case?"
"In which case," Miss May cheer
fully decided, "you simply have to
change the whole thing â the public is
the only final appeal."
Mr. Albaugh continued it: "You
wouldn't like the sort of surprises in
volved In our work. You often get a
howl where you expect a tear."
"Have you?" I insinuated.
"Haven't you?" he retorted.
Somehow then I became aware of
the identity of the book upon which
I was scribbling. " 'Plutarch's Lives,' "
I cried, holding It up.
"Oh yes!" Miss May giggled, her
big blue eyes looking as if they had
never scanned anything heavier than
"The Duchess." "I got that the other
day for 25 cents. Wasn't It a bargain?"
"What did you buy it for?" I de
manded.
"Anything to fill up the trunk*?,"
she laughed and spread her cheerful
hands.
And then under the table I spied
"Marcus Aurelius." I looked accus
ingly at the lady.
"Oh, I don't sleep very well," she
explained, "and I have to dip into
one of those dull old persons like
Eplctetus to quiet my seething brain."
"Oh!" I commented, but I took In

IX MUSIC OFFERINGS
PRESENT AND COMING
THERE IS MUCH CHARM
One hears with pleasure the news of
Beatrice Bronte's (Beatrice MIchelena,
and wherefore Bronte, O Bee!) latest
engagement as Peggy In "Peggy from
Paris." Miss Bronte is the excellently
pretty and clever daughter of Fernando
Michelena, and made a successful ap
pearance here recently in that odd
Smith and Company musical melange,
"A Girl From Dixie." She begins her
season early in September, and may
be heard here during its course.
The caste Includes also another Cali
fornia girl, Grace Orr Myers, the
daughter of the only Annie. Miss My

other operas, will have the part of

Talking of the Henry W. Savage pro
ductions ,of which "Peggy From Baris"
is one, reminds of a significant note I
lately received, concerning the Savage
grand opera season In Pittsburg. Pitts
burg has recently had two weeks of
the Savage opera, including produc
tions of "Lohengrin," "Tannhauser,"
"Carmen," "Otello," "II Trovatore" and,
"Bohemian Girl." The point is this,
however, that Pittsburg then heard
the "Otello" for the first time.
How long is It, Tivoleans, since that
old -master, Salassa, first rolled out the
"Credo?" Long enough and often
enough for its seductive chromatics to
come to the tongue almost as easily
as "La Donna e Mobile." Yet a
few weeks ago only Pittsburgh with it3
Victor Herbert, its symphony orches
tra, its nearness to the musical base
of supplies, was. listenng to explana
tory "Otello" lectures by the local
Walter Damrosch, Bradford Mills, on
the occasion of the opera's first pre
sentation there.
It is facts of this kind that bring
home to one the value of the Tlvoll to
the community. Not only "Otello," but
operas like the Boito "Meflstofele"; the
new masterworks, such as "La Tosca,"
"Andre Chenler," "Zaza"; the rarer old
operas, like "Ea Sonnambula," "Lucre
zia Borgia," "Don Pasquale" and prac
tically the whole of the routine Italian
repertoire, have been familiarized for
us by the Tivoli, and in some startling
ly good performances. One is very cu
rious to hear Mr. Savage's English
grand opera company. With that of
New Orleans there will be found no
more sympathetic audience than the
local one in all America* if the company
be found worthy. They are to come
here next February.
"Parsifal," by the way, is to be one of
the offerings. The list of names of the
artists who are to expound "Parsifal" in
English for us will be found suggestive.
The English of It seems to stop with
singular abruptness at the cast. \ Still,
Mr. Savage claims only to give "opera
in English," not yet American opera,
sung by Americans in English. The list,
a very promising one from the vocal
side of the performance, Includes, how
ever, yet another Californlan in Put
nam Griswold, now a noble Frank
forter at the opera-house there. The
whole cast, by the way, is now engaged
in absorbing "Parsifal" at Bayreuth
and will take in the whole half-dozen
performances of the opera. Here are
the people: Alois Pennarini, the prin
cipal tenor of the Stadt Theater in
Hamburg; Christian de Vose of the
Netherlands Royal Opera, Amsterdam;
Hanna Mara of . the Stadt Theater,
Breslau; Johannes BischofC of the
Stadt Theater. Cologne; Putnam
Griswold of the Frankfort Opera
house, Franz Egenieff of the
Theater des Westens, Florence Wick-'
ham of the Royal Conservatory of Mu
sic, Francis MacClennan of the Moody-
Manners Opera Company and the two
conductors, Walter H. Rothwell and
Moritz Grimm. Mme. Kirkby Lunn,
who has just closed her season at the
Royal Opera, Covent Garden, London,
has been detained in England by im
portant concert engagements, but she
will join her colleagues "at Bayreuth in
time to hear the last two performances
of "Parsifal."
To return to the Tivoli for a moment.
As regards the week's "Toreador." Per
haps "The Toreador" counts little
musically, but its production, as well
as that of the preceding "Robin Hood."
marks a new era in Tivoli history. Fun
you could always count on in the Tivoli
comic opera, spirit, originality. But,
generally speaking, it was comic opera
In .its shirt sleeves, with a short pipe
and a pot of beer in front of It. Only
those that have seen the last named
productions will understand the ad
vance that has been made. Nothing
smarter than "The Toreador" has been
seen here. Its scenery is glitteringly
fresh. Its chorus gowning and girling
are as spick and span as youth, money
and good taste can make 'em. The
stage management has simply chuted
into excellence. A completer contrast to
the happy-go-lucky, go-it-alone, any
thing-goes sort of drill of the old re
grime cannot be imagined. Things move
with all the polish, pomp and circum
stance of a comic opera "Durbar." The
orchestra, is as good as it always was,
with the best comic opera leader in the
country behind it. The cast â well, we
have had good casts in plenty at the
Tivoli, but this one and the last have
added style, wads of It, to ability. In
fact, one feels that only one's best
frock can do Justice to the new Tivoli
first nights.
"The Toreador" should be seen â not
simply for its style. The piece has
been greatly improved since its open-
Ing, by the, way. The second act moves
now as swiftly as the first. There Is to
see Teddy Webb as an English "tiger"
in one of the cleverest bits of character
work seen on the local stage. Willard
Sims has another as a haw-haw Eng
lish milord. John J. Kennedy con
tributes a capital grotesque as an ani
mal trainer. John Dunsmure con
tributes a splendiferously musical and
picturesque toreador. Melville Ellis,
who with i Ferris Hartman is - to > be
this afternoon. The rest of the bill
promises well.
Four new acts will hold the board
at the Chutes this coming week
and the entire programme will
be one of the best ever offered at this
popular place of amusement.

Then I ventured: "Are your politteal
opinions like those of the 'girl from
Kansas'?" I scented new women and
all sorts of feminine depth under the
attractive May disguise.
"My political opinions," the suspect
ed one tinkled, "oh, they're just like
the girl's in the play â aren't they,
Jack?"
"She's a black Republican," testi
fied Mr. Albaugh.
"Never mind," I said meaningly.
"But you may tell me now what you
have done in the dramatic arena,
stock or "
"No, I've never been in stock â at
least, only in the Empire and Lyceum,
companies, and the plays run there
generally for a whole season."
"I've told her that a stock experi
ence would be useful to her," the ac
tor advanced, looking at her with fra
ternal pride.
"I don't know â " Miss May threw
a lazy, round arm over the end of the
lounge and contrived to look even
more gracefully comfortable than she
had been looking ' all the afternoon,
"I don't know that I'm so keen for
work as all that."
"What have you done that you liked
particularly?" I asked. /
"I'm fond of Bonita â comedy, of
course, is my forte, that sort. I was
almost coming here with John Drew
and Maude Adams In 'The Butterflies,'
by the way. That is another play I'm
very fond of. He, he, he! A Boston
man interviewed me when we were
playing it in Boston. We Just talked â
as we're doing nowâ and I nearly col
lapsed when I saw the pageful of
pearls of wisdom that I'd spilled the
next day. Talk about La Rochefou
cauld's Maxims â "
"We didn't talk about La Rochefou
cauld's Maxims," I grinned. "I sus
pect you, Miss May, of being a miser
able bluestocking."
"Oh dear, oh dear!" she gurgled.
"How dreadful! Where was I? Oh,
yes, I used to be w'th Stuart Robsonâ
a splendid gentleman â and last season I
was with 'A Japanese Nightingale* and
'The Spenders.' There, that's the story
of my life."
I inquired: "How was 'A Japanese
Nightingale?' "
"It went finely so long as we papered
the house," the lady giggled lusciously
again.
"And you were to come here with
Maude Adams and John Drew?" I re
verted.
"And I'm eo sorry I didn't come â
you're all so kind. One has such fun,
too, with John Drew â "
"Fun! John Drew!"
"He's such a guyer â "
"Guyer!" I could say no more.
"Why, nothing made him happier
than to break me all up," Miss May
related, "and I could do nothing but
snort when he did itâ like this," and
like another girl I know Miss May
snorted like an amused and musical
pony.
Immediately then I understood the
temptation of John Drew.
"And you think we're nice?"
"Every one has been bo kind," Miss
May said, "kind to our play and kind
to us. I'm so glad, too, for Mr. Stew
art's sake. You'll hear more of him,
some day."
"Shouldn't wonder," I said.
"Oh, and the fioSvers here," she.
"And the fine restaurants!" he.
"The roses â "
"The terrapinâ"
"The gay crowds â " both.
"The cheapness of things â " both.
"I saw a man with an armful of
American Beauties the other dayâ"
she.
"Must have got reckless and blown
himself, in for at least $3," he.
"Oh. come and see us again when
you don't have to, won't you?" thus,
kindly, both.
"She's kinder pretty, ain't she?" said
my friend the elevator boy. He had
caught the backwash of that beatific
giggle. I knew the wretched diplomat
meant she was "a regular peach," but
I said only "kinder."

That the young lieutenant was not
the fiance of the little Castillan lady
there Is abundant evidence. And It Is
greatly to her credit that she herself
has never claimed it. But as a stain
upon the honor of a brave soldier, the
tale ought to be pruned. It would be a

sode were omitted. Then let's, do it.
Poor old Sherman's where he can't

tience to sei a venerable bachelor lady
of Monterey posing daily â 25 cents per
pose â as the kissed and caressed maid
en who for fifty years has longed for
and looked for the coming of her errant
lover, who, the tale has it, was none
ether than General William T. Sher
man, then a gay young lieutenant sta
tioned at the barracks at Monterey.
Without her neat adobe cottage stands
a yellow rose tree, which the dear rc
rrancists say was planted by the gay
young officer and the coy Castillan
maid in token of their trothâ that when
the roses bloomed then would he come
to her from afar and make her his
pretty bride. Now, nobody doubts that
young Sherman kissed the lady â he
was notoriously fond of kissing pretty
women â and who could blame him, for
was he not a gallant soldier? But as
to promising to wed her and failing to
redeem his promise, that's another
story and a libel upon the honor of a
good soldier, although it may make a
pretty tale.
As for the men's rooms, well, that, of
course, is for them to decide. If they
really must have a little Jug of brandy
and a bottle or two of soda on the buf

Captain Matousevitch, the late Rear
Admiral Withoeft's chief of staff, under
date of Aujjust 12:
"At dawn of August 10 our Port
Arthur squadron began to make for the
open sea and emerged from the port at
9 o'clock. The squadron consisted of six
battleships, the cruisers Askold, Diana,
Pallada and Xovik and eight torpedo
boats. The Japanese opposed us with
the following force:
"A first detachment, consisting of the
battleships AsahJ, Mikasa, Fuji, Ya
shlmi-and Shikishima and the cruisers
Nisshin and Kasaga: a second detach
ment, consisting of the cruisers' Ya
kumo, Kasagi, Chitose and Takasago.
and a third detachment, consisting of
the cruisers Akitsushima, Idzumi, Mat
sushima, Itsukushima and Hashldate
and the battleship Chinyen, with about
thirty torpedo-boats.
"Our squadron maneuvered to gain a
passage through the line of the enemy's
ships. Meantime the Japanese tor
pedo-boats were laying floating, mines
in the way of our squadron, thus ren
dering evolutions very difficult.
"At 1 p. m. our squadron, after forty
minutes' lighting, succeeded in effect

toward Shantung, x he enemy, follow

slowly, and at 5 o'clock fighting again

without either eide obtaining any ad

"In the battle the commander of our
squadron was killed and the captain of
the battleship Cesarevitch was wound
ed and lost consciousness. Almost at
the same time the engines and steer
ing gear of the Cesarevitch were dam
aged and she was obliged to stop forty
minutes. This forced the other ships
to maneuver around her. The com
mand of the squadron devolved upon
Rear Admiral Prince Ouktomsky and
the command of the Cesarevltch on the
second in command.

The San Francisco CallJohn D. Rockefeller has a little
grandson something over a half dozen
years of age of whom he is very fond.
One day recently this youngster, while
visiting at the Rockefeller country
home, at Pocantico Hills, New York,
mounted his grandparent's knee and
said:
"Grandpa, here's a picture of you
that I drawed."
"Ah, yes," replied Mr. Rockefeller, as
he examined it '. "Very interesting.
What am I doing?"
"Coming home from the village
store." '
"Yes, yes; I see. But what's that I
have in my hand?" '

Rockefeller's Picture.
The Declaration of Independence is '
a most trenchant argument to show
that George III was a very poor kind
of king and that the colonies could do
better by setting up for themselves. Of
course, the British Government did
not think that the colonies were yet
ready for self-government. No Gov
ernment ever does think this of its
colonies. When Secretary Taft says
that independence for the islands lying
off in the Pacific must not be men
tioned for years to come, he is simply
echoing the spirit of the past and of
all governments which get their grip
on a people without their consent. It
would have knocked American inde
pendence higher than a kite. But the
"spirit of '76" was greater, mightier,
truer to human instinct and human
right George III did not believe that
the American colonies were ready for
self-government simply because he did
not want to believe it The first ques
tion to ask ourselves Is whether we
want the Philippines to have inde
pendence. If we do not, we will al
ways be able to'flnd an argument to
run with our wishes. # '
Lincoln said that no man was good
enough' to govern another without his
consent. But Lincoln was a rare kind
of human. In these smart days there
are men who think themselves . good
enough for anything. "And as between
George III and Lincoln they lean up
against the former. â Chicago Advance.

LONDON, Aug. 13.â The cutting out

for the purpose of ascertaining if the
Ryeshitelni was really dismantled, and
that the Japanese boat's crew was at

LONDON, Aug. 13. â A dispatch
from Weihaiwei says the Russian tor

south of the Shantung Promontory.
Three of her officers and sixty men,
who walked from the scene of the ac
cident, have arrived at Weihaiwei.

A dispatch from St. Petersburg to
a news agency says the machinery of
the Russian battleship Cesarevitch
was so damaged during the fight that
most of it is worthless. She lost 210
officers and men killed and sixty
wounded.
Rear Admiral Withoeft was on the
bridge of the Cesarevitch when a shell
exploded there, blowing him to pieces.
"A dispatch from Shanghai says the
reason given for the entrance of the
Russian torpedo-boat destroyer .Gro

sary to repair her machinery. The
vessel, the dispatch adds, shows no
signs of recent fighting, except that
her forward rails are damaged. Her
hull, guns. and torpedo tubes are un
injured.
The officers of the Grozovoi report
that the Russian warships, after a se
vere engagement, forced their way
through the Japanese fleet and
escaped in several directions.
The correspondent of the Evening
News at Tsingchou cables that he
learned from an officer of the Rus
sian battleship Cesarevitch that the
Russian Port Arthur squadron met the
Japanese squadron twenty miles out.
The flagship Cesarevitch was espe
cially attacked and changed her
course for the Shantung Peninsula.
The Japanese followed and overhauled
her and the accompanying vessels off

noon. A two hours' battle followed.

RUSSIANS LOYAL TO THE FLAGSHIP
Japanese Release Two Prizes.
TIENTSIN. Friday. Aug. 12.â The
Japanese have released the British
steamships Hslping and Peiplng, own
ed by the China Mining and Engineer-
Ing Company of Shanghai, which were
captured in July last. Part of their
cargoes also were released.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 14.â Not
since the beginning of the war between
Japan and Russia has anything so ob
viously affected Russian spirits as the
gradual revelation of the extent of the
Port Arthur squadron's reverse.
' The efforts of the Russians to fight
their way through the Japanese prob
ably would have been successful had it
not been for the disaster to the battle
ship Cesarevitch, which compelled the
squadron to .fight a second battle, end
ing in the dispersal of the Russian fleet
in darkness.
The awful mortality among the offi
cers of the Cesarevitch, which was
merely stated in the official report, was
due to the fact that Admiral Withoeft
and most of his officers were gathered
on the bridge, during the action, in or
der to set a j example to and encour
age the men, Instead of remaining in
comparative safety in the protection
of the conning tower.
A Japanese shell burst beneath the
bridge, wrecking that part of the ship
and killing or wounding every officer
on dutv thereabouts.
One of the most Important features
of Captain Matousevltch's dispatch,
aside from Its grimly brief account of
the battle, is the detailed statement of
the make-up of Rear Admiral Togo's
fleet, which .consisted of six battleships,
eleven cruisers of various classes and
approximately thirty torpedo-boats.
According to this statement there
were in line of battle some ships pre
viously reported destroyed. This gives
an indication of the Japanese naval
strength, which Admiral Togo has hith
erto concealed. >. .

that the Russian losses are reported to
be enormous. *

night of August 8. and who arrived

The distress caused by the squad
ron's failure to get away has height
ened, if possible, the bitter resentment
felt over the conduct of the Japanese
in the Ryeshitelni affair and the Mi
kado's orders to allow non-combatants
to leave Port Arthur merely deepens
the painful impression, indicating as it
does the belief of the highest Japanese
authorities in the imminence of the fall
of Port Arthur.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 14, 3:40
a. m. â Rear Admiral Withoeft, who
was in command of the Russian naval
forces at Port Arthur, was killed dur
ing the engagement of "Wednesday.
The Emperor has received a tele
gram from Tsingchou, signed by Cap
tain Matouzvitch, the rear admiral's
chief of staff, reporting that Withoeft
met his death aboard the flagship
Cesarevitch. Both his legs were blown
off.
Captain Wamoff of the Cesarevitch,
Captain Samoff and several officers
were wounded.
Several officers besides the rear ad
miral were killed. The battleship sus
tained severe damage. Her rudder
was broken beyond hope of repair.
Captain Matousevitch did not report
as to the whereabouts of the other
vessels, but the dlsatpch adds that the
protected cruiser Novik has left Tsing
chou.
The Admiralty entertains the hope
that some of the battleships, after the
return to Port Arthur, managed to
elude Admiral Togo and Join the
Vladivostok squadron. It is pointed
out that the Admiralty now explicitly
states that the Russian squadron ac
tually went back to Port Arthur.
The Russian account of the latest na
val battle between the Japanese and
Russian fleets Indicates that the Japa
nese torpedo-boats sustained their pre
vious reputation for daring by making
a daylight attack upon a squadron in
battle formation, and admits the effect
iveness of these frail,- daring craft,
which seriously Impeded the move
ments of the Russian fleet
The wording of the official report that
the battleship Cesarevitch "turned" to
try to go In the direction of Vladivo
stok arouses some comment here. As
suming, as the report seems to Indicate,
that the battle was off the Shantung
peninsula, the turning of the Cesare
vitch to go toward Vladivostok would
most probably indicate that the re
mainder of the squadron was going
back In the direction of Port Arthur.
At the same time the report that the
day after the battle four Russian bat
tleships were < sighted off Shanghai
makes it possible that the battle oc
curred farther south in the Yellow Sea
than the report of Captain Matouse
vitch indicates and that when the Ce-
Barevitch "lost sight of the remainder
of the squadron" the Russian fleet was
actually proceeding southward. This
opens an interesting question as to the
ultimate destination of the remaining
Russian battleships.
The fact that the crushing nature of
the blow to the Russian fleet was
largely due to the feeling of comrade
ship which prompted the squadron to
halt for the purpose of protecting the
disabled Cesarevitch is viewed here
with grim satisfaction and regret Is
mingled with admiration for the
brother officers who threw away their
"Scouting with the aid of the
telephone has â¢ become ona of the
features of modern warfare, and
Is now being made use of by
the Japanese," says the "Western
Electrician. "Two scouts proceed
from the lines toward the enemy; one,
the observer, is a skilled army officer,
who makes the observations, which are
transmitted back to headquarters
through a telephone line paid out from
a reel carried by an electrician of the
signal corps. A ground return is used,
the ground being made by thrusting a
bayonet or hatchet Into the earth and
attaching one end of the line to it. The
electrician carries a battery on his
back. He also makes the connections
and does the talking. A special con
ductor Is used, which will stand rough
usage. In this manner a scout may be
able to stay out a long time and give
valuable information without being
obliged to make a number of hazardous
trips to the front."

CESAREVITCn OUT OF ACTION.
Hnttleship Probably Will Be Dis-
mantled in TsIiikcIiou Harbor.
TSINGCHOU, Aug. 13. â The Rus
sian battleship Cesarvitch received
terrible punishment in the fight off
Shantung Promontory on August 10.
The Cesarevitch bore the brunt of the
fighting until 4 o'clock in the after
noon, when Admiral Withoeft was
hit by a shell, which blew his body to
pieces, only one of his legs being
found after the explosion. Four of
ficers standing near him were killed.
Altogether the Cesarevitch lost fifteen
men killed and forty-five wounded.
At 4 o'clock in the afternoon of
August 11 a Russian torpedo-boat de
stroyer, badly damaged, steamed slow
ly into Tsingchou and a half hour lat
er the protected cruiser Novik, slight
ly injured, entered port. No dead were
on board either vessel. They took coal
and departed at 3 o'clock on the
morning of August 12. 1
The battleship Cesarevitch arrived
at Tsingchou on the night of August
11, steaming at the rate of four knots
an hour and burning immense quan
tities of coal to make even that rate of
speed. Her rudder shaft was broken,
one gun was disabled, lifeboats had
been lost, her masts were badly bent,
her funnels were riddled and her
bridge had been twisted out of posi
tion. The projectile holes above the
water line were covered with make
shift stoppers of wood.
The same night, August 11, the
cruiser Askold, with fifteen of her
crew dead and twelve wounded, and
one torpedo-boaf destroyer attempted
to enter Tsingchou, but were kept out
by a Japanese cruiser, whereupon
they proceeded to Woosung.
The officers of the Cesarevitch are
of the opinion that the Japanese ves
sels undoubtedly suffered severely in
the fighting, as the pursuit of the
Cesarevitch was maintained for a
short time only. The decks of the
Russian battleship were slippery with
blood and the men on board were al
most deaf as a result of the concus
sions of firing.
Several Japanese cruisers are now
reported to be off Shantung Promon
tory near the scene of the fighting,
while destroyers on scouting duty are
watching the mouth ! of; Tsingchou
harbor.
The German warships at Tsingchou
to-night are the cruisers Fuerst Bis
marck, Geier, Hansa and Hertha, the
gunboats * Luchs and Tiger and two
torpedo-boat destroyers. They con
trol the harbor exit absolutely.
TOGO HURRIES TO SHANGHAI.
Battleship Squadron Will Intercept
Russian Ships in That Vicinity.
CHEFU, Aug. 13. â According to
Chinese authority, the Russians had
six and the Japanese four warships at
the beginning of the fight off Shantung
Promontory. The Japanese, however,
soon were reinforced, but to what ex
tent is not stated.
A private telegram received here to
night says that the Russian battleship
Cesarevitch has moved farther into
Tsingchou harbor, following a demand
made by the Japanese that the Rus
sians come out and fight. It is sur
mised that the Cesarevitch will be dis
mantled.
The German cruiser Thetis left
Tsingchou hastily to-day. An Italian
warship also has left there. The desti
nations of these vessels are not known.
Admiral Togo is said to be with the
main portion of the Japanese â¢ fleet,
which has gone toward Shanghai. This
portion of the fleet includes all the
battleships.
The whereabouts of the Russian
cruisers Pallada and Novlk are not
known here. It Is believed* that if
these vessels are still afloat they will
undoubtedly endeavor to' connect with,
the Vladivostok squadron.
A -cipher telegram received here
from Osaka, Japan, confirms previous
reports that the Japanese main squad
ron is bound for a southern destina
tion "on an active campaign."
Launches containing sixty Russian
sailors are said to have entered Wei
haiwei to-day. The sailors belong to
two torpedo-boat destroyers which are
reported to have gone ashore in the
vicinity of Weihaiwei. These ' vessels
presumably are the same which were
reported yesterday to have been cap
tured. ~.'5-j
The steamship Dagmar, ariving to
night from Tsingchou, had on board
the harbor pilot who steered the Rus
sian battleship Cesarevitch into that
port. He confirms the press reports
regarding the damage to the Cesare
vitch and adds that her rudder shaft
was broken during the fight, but that
her engines were not badly injured.
He expresses the opinion that the
fighting days of the Cesarevitch are
over and that she probably will be
dismantled.

This is due to the fact that the suc

Trusance could recall only two im
portant incorporations since the open
ing of the fiscal year, that of the

TRENTON, N. J., Aug. 13. â Those
best acquainted with the subject in
the office of Secretary of State Dickin
son say that the large falling off in
the State's receipts from the sale of
corporation charters may be due to
the possibility. that pretty nearly every
industry that can well be formed into
a trust has already been so organized.
But they have not failed to observe
also that up to 1902 there had been
a steady procession of new corpora
tions, large enough to keep the State'!
Income from that source close up to
the half-million mark. Thus the
$200,000 reduction ln the annual
revenue in 1903 and the loss during
the current year of an additional $75.
000 or $80,000 loses none of its sig
nificance as an object lesson on the
apparent falling off of the trust ten
dency.
Secretary Trusance, the head of the
State's corporation charter bureau,
said there- had been a considerable
falling off in the number and .much
more noticeable decline in the re
ceipts. .The State's fee is regulated by
the capitalization, and the figures
show a smaller average capitalization
in the new companies.

Falling Off of New Jersey's Re
ceipts for Corporate Charters.

STOCKTON, Aug. 13. â A quiet but
determined revolution was effected in
the Republican politics of San Joaquin
County to-day. George S. Harkness
was displaced as chairman of the
county committee and the legislative
State ticket of the so-called Muenter-
Beardslee faction was put through in
the county convention by a big ma
jority. Frank E. Dunlap goes on the
shelf for the time being, Senator j
iluenter having defeated him ln the
convention by a vote of 151 to 71.
The election of a commltteeman-at
large came next and the friends of
Harkness taking their cue from i.he
vote on Senator withdrew his name
and E. P. Foltz, the- slate candidate,
was given the honor. Foltz stated :
that he was unaware till last evening
that the honor was to come to him.
There had been some talk that in
the interest of harmony Beardslee was
to be withdrawn from the Assembly
fight and the nomination given to for
mer Superior Judge Buck, a promi
nent lawyer, who was looked upon
with favor by the minority, but the
â¢ Muenter people had the votes in the
convention and they completed their
, slate by handing Beardslee the nomi
; nation for inside Assemblyman and
; J. W. Moore for the county district.
i Everything after the vote on Senator
went by acclamation.
The defeated ones have promised
the ticket their hearty support. Com
j paratlvely- few votes at the 'primaries
would have turned the results of to
i day's convention. Muenter is an ener-
I getic campaigner and Beardslee is a
young lawyer, at present City Attor
ney.^ Moore is superintendent of the
I Williams-Bixler ranch at Undine.
i Dr. Harkness had been chairman of
i the county committee for eight years
! and under his administration the party
has been 1 built up and strengthened.
! There has been an almost continuous
I fight against him and to-day his op
Â¦ ponents landed a knockout. This was
dine ,by careful organization, made
j easier by "dissension and a lack of
vigorous leadership among the de
i feated men.

Professor von Osten 'affirms that the
horse is as well educated as a boy who
'has gone to school for the same number
of years, and the professor desires that
a commission of specialists be selected
to take the horse under observation for
four weeks. This probably will be done,
with the view of determining whether
the conventional idea is true that ani
mal instinct and human Intelligence
are essentially. different.
The horse, besides adding, subtract
ing, multiplying and dividing- sums,
dots examples Involving several of
those operations, and not only simply
repeats what it is taught, but solves
fresh problems put to him by the ex
aminers in the absence of his master,
showing a grasp of the principles of
arithmetic. The stallion also forms lit
tle sentences, remembers them next day
and discriminates between twelve col
ors and shades and gives their names.
The animal distinguishes musical tones,
indicating where they are situated on
the chromatic scale, and picks out dis
cords, designating which tone to omit
in order td restore harmony. The horse
communicates by a system of hoof
beats representing the alphabet.
Professor Schillings has taken much
interest in displaying the horse's ac
complishments to other scientists. Dr.
Studt says . Herr von Osten would have
been burned; as a wizard in the earlier
Â¦ages of the world.-, :'" ; ".

REDDING. Aug. 13. â A number of
cattle in Eastern Shasta County have
of late been dying from a disease that
is baffling the veterinary surgeons and
cattlemen. In all of the cases the
lifart of the dead cow weighs three
times that of the normal. E. C. Mc-
Cloud of Round Mountain noticed the
trouble first. The cow. suddenly re
fused to eat and continued for three
days, when death came. The teeth
became loose .and could be pulled out
jcusily with the hand. McCloud
thought the animal suffered from a
disease that was familiar to him and
-he doctored the cow accordingly, with
f>o effect. When the cow died Me
Â¦Cloud performed an autopsy and was
â¢eurpiised and somewhat startled to
Â£ad the heart enlarged nearly three
tiroes its normal size. He weighed It
and the scales registered a little over
thirteen pounds. . The organ could not
be i)!aced in a ten-pound lard bucket

GETS DIVORCE FROM MAN
BECAUSE OF HIS KINDNESS
DENVER, Aug. 13. â Senator T. M.
Patterson of Colorado has gone to
Navajo Springs to meet the chiefs of
the Ute nation and try to make ar
rangements with them whereby they
will convey to the United States Gov
ernment the tract known as the Mesa
Verde lands and its ancient ruins.
These ruins are of inestimable. value
as prehistoric studies, and the present
movement is the result of an amend
ment to the Indian appropriation bill
which gives the President the right to
negotiate -for the purchase of the
lands and looks to the preservation of
the ruins.'

LANDS OF UTE NATION
SOUGHT BY GOVERNMENT
CONSTANTINOPLE, Aug. 13.â The
issues between Turkey and the United
States were ' arranged to-day to the
satisfaction of both Government.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 13. â There
was some expectation that the State
Department would be able to-day to
announce the successful conclusion of
the negotiations with Turkey look
ing to the prevention of discrimination
against American citizens there. An
answer has been received from tha
Turkish Government which is re
garded as satisfactory, and to make
sure there will be no misunderstand
ing as to the agreement the State De
partment embodies its own construc
tion, of that agreement in the last
chapters of the correspondence. But
there has been some delay in the ex
change of cable messages, so that it is
not expected now that the last word
will be said until Monday. Meanwhile
Admiral Jewell's fleet will remain at
Smyrna, awaiting notice from Minister
Leishman.
It may be said, however, that the
incident is practically closed, with a
victory for the State Department on
all points.

ing.
The daily average of clearings last
week was $165,000,000, or $5,000,000
less than In the previous week: the
clearings on Saturday, reflecting Fri
day's business, $198,629,679, or much
above the average.
With such an enormous surplus re
serve as that shown by the statement
on the eve of the.season!s usual re
quirements for money for the crop
movement and %vith the prospect of an
increase in this surplus in the imme
diate future as the result of receipts of
gold from Australia, Japan, the Klon
dike and from domestic fields, in ex
cess of the withdrawals of gold for do
mestic fields in. excess of withdrawals
or gold for export to Cuba and pos
sibly to Europe, it would seem that
there is little prospect for relief from
money congestion at this center* for
the present, at least. â¢
NEW YORK, Aug. 13. â The Finan
cier this week says:
The official statement of the New
York Associated Banks last week
showed a gain in the cash reserve
nearly equal to the amount which was
estimated from the traceable move
ments of money during the week, the
net increase in cash as reported in the
statement being $2,152,400, while the
estimates called for a gain of $3,187,
500. There was an increase of $3,6St>,
700 in specie. Inasmuch as the aver
ages of the exports of gold coin to
Cuba in the week, which were one
and a quarter millions, were offset by
more than two and three-quarter mil
lions receipts from Australia and
other sources, it would appear that
the difference between the net result
ing from these movements and the
amount of increase in specie reported
in the statement was due to the bring
ing over of average gains in this item
from the previous week.

The Influence In the iron and steel
trade has been less reassuring and the
heaviness, of the stocks of campanies
in that trade has been something of a
drag on the market. Fears of a dls-,
ruptlon of the v pools for maintaining
prices of finished products have been
the unfavorable factor. Labor condi
tions continue unsettled and are the
cause of an undercurrent > of uneasi
ness in the stock market-
Conditions In the exchange market
have hovered near the gold export
point and engagements for shipment
to London have been several times
made and then canceled. The factor
has been the needs of the London
money market and the redundancy of
our own money market. . With gold
flowing into San Francisco, both from
Japan and Australia, and with an
early prospect of a supply of cotton
bills in the exchange market, the gold
export question has aroused little in
terest in the stock market and has hot
affected the extreme ease of the local
money market at all.
In the case of corn the threatened
shortage of wheat in Europe and the
small exportable surplus here Indi
cate a largely increased demand for
corn for foreign account, with corre
sponding benefits in the sale of our
large crop. Business sentiment has
improved correspondingly.
actual disaster to the crop. The weekly
bulletin of the Weather Bureau on
Tuesday, covering conditions of the
preceding week, did not prove soothins
to hhe fears for that crop. But the
monthly report of the Agricultural De
partment worked a decided change in
sentiment In the stock market, and
even the renewed jump in the wheat
market did not entirely remove the as
surance caused by that report. Al
though the condition there reported
dated back to August 1, before much of
the alleged harm had been done to
wheat. It was felt that the August 1
condition, with its indication of nearly
606,000.000 bushels, impeached the cred
ulity of the extreme estimates of the
later damage done. The action of the
wheat market itself was attributed In
large part to excess of speculation and
to- technical conditions in the imme
diate supply available in the markets Â¦
The most favorable auguries were'
drawn from the Government report on
the corn and cotton crops. Present,
conditions in' these crops are felt to
warrant an assumption of a bumper
yield for both, and this assumption Is
likely to form the estimate of these
crops so long as no deleterious effect
upon them is reported in the news. Be
sides the encouragement of abundant
crops of these two great staple prod
ucts very hopeful views are held of the
chances for a profitable market for
them in the coining season. The firm
ness with which the prices are held, in
face of the brilliant prospects for these
crops, is attributed to this promise.
The low price of cotton the world over,
due to the discouragement of buyers by
the recent high prices, is held as an
inducement to replenish stocks.
DEMAND FOR CORN.
The excited speculation in this group
of stocks had some sympathetic effect
on the general market, In the face of
the disturbing effect of the wild up
ward flight of the price of wheat and
the damage reports of sprinj^JtlWat by
rust, which carried an Impression of
EXCITED SPECULATION.
The bank statement was of small in
fluence, although the cash gain failed
to come up to the estimates on account,
it is believed, of the remittances to
Cuba, which complicated the showing.
The surplus reserve now stands at Â§uch
a high level that the degree of influence
is of little moment. A little realizing
in the final dealings under cover of an
alvance In Sugar made the closing
slightly irregular.
â¢Total sales of bonds, par value, 51,
065,000.
The stock speculation of the week has
been more active and has shown great
er activity, and the broadening ten
dency of the speculation has increased
as the week progressed. Crop prospects
have held the chief attention of opera
tors, and the conflict of views on that
subject and the divergent outlook for
different cross have been reflected in
the confused tendencies in the mover
ment of prices.
Early in the week, when the impend
ing Government crop report induced. a
waiting attitude toward the granger
stocks, there was a furious speculation
diverted into a group of industrials
and such realties, notably the Metro
politan traction stocks, which made
sensational advances and led the mar
ket in point of activity for several
days. Many rumors flooded the street
as to the project in contemplation for
the control of the companies involved,
but no official or authoritative an
nouncements were given out to war
rant entire credence in any of them.
The belief is very generally held, how
ever, that plans are working out for
unifying the control and combining
the operation of the surface, elevated
and subway traction facilities of the
city of New York. Some credence is
given to the further rumors of the in
clusion of the Brooklyn Transit and
New Jersey trolley companies in the
plans, thus involving a comprehensive
control of all the traction facilities In
the city and in the suburban neighbor
hood.
FALLS BELOW ESTIMATE.
NEW YORK, Augr. 13.â The strength
in to-day's stock market was marked,
but was largely In sympathy with the
active movement in a few prominent
stocks. The most Important radiating
center was United States Steel pre
ferred, which rose aggressively above
60 on an urgent demand, in which an
uncovered short interest was believed
to play an important part. This stock
was influenced by reports that the dis
put in the trade over the price of steel
billets had been settled and the danger
of a disruption of that and other pools
thus avoided. It was rumored that this
had been effected by the purchase of
the Youngstown plant of the Republic
Iron and Steel Company, but there was
no verification of this rumor.
Pennsylvania and its subsidiary
stocks and the soft coal group felt the
sympathetic benefit of the movement
in United States Steel preferred, espe
cially owing to the large part played
in their traffic by iron and steel and
the materials for their production. In
the early morning there was some evi
dence of realizing in the Pacifies, and
this caused some hesitation in the gen
eral list. The occasional pressure of
profit taking in Metropolitan Securities
had the same effect. "When Southern
Pacific broke through its restraint and
rose above 56 the whole" market took
on a more assuring tone.
Union Pacific did not move In com
pany with its subsidiary stock, and the
Western stocks generally were inclined
to hang back, except Atchison, which
came forward vigorously to 81.

TUNNEL UNDER EAST RIVER
IS DAMAGED BY A IiEAK
Water Drips Through Fissure in Roof
and Floods One Section Before
Hole Is Sealed.
NEW YORK. Aug. 3.â A small
fissure in the rocks forming the roof
of the tunnel now being dug under
East River, from Battery Park to Co
lumbia Heights. Brooklyn, has caused
much trouble to the workmen. The
water leaking through reached a
depth of six feet in one section before
It could be controlled by pumping.
The leak was only a short distance
from the seawall at the Battery. "When
It tu discovered two pumps wera
started, but one broke down, allow
ing the -water to gain rapidly. When
repairs had been made the risa was
quickly checked and the fissure suc
cessfully sealed. An airlock appa
ratus at the end of the. affected sec
tion prevented the water from reach
ing the outer portion of the tunnel,
and no permanent damage was done.

St. Txrals Exposition Proves Attractive
OAIJFORNTANS AT FAIR.
Most of the buildings erected on the
reservation are made of bamboo and

ands arid were erected by the Filipi
nos. It Is said that much money; was
a Question whether the average person
who is attracted by a few uncouth sav
ages, and especially savages who feed
on dogs, cares a great deal about the
fine woods or other articles that be
speak rich resources. The business
man whose interest is centered in
trade and development is not likely to
be drawn very far by a promenade of
wild men. He has other things to
think about. At any rate for the pal
try percentage it may get from these
shows the Insular board. could hardly
afford to sacrifice its self-respect.
There is no doubt the exhibition of
native tribes is desirable, but this
could have been done without the
rattle of dogbone castanets and the
putting of these tribes ahead of the
resources and educational progress of
the islands. The subjecting of an
expenditure of $1,250,000, or whatever
the total may reach, to a few side
shows makes it look as if there had
been some careful planning some
where â as if some far sighted people
had got a finger into tha exhibiting
scheme.
. The Insular government should
have made these tribal exhibits and
made them free, and It should have
seen that the world was informed ex
tensively about its real civilization.
Up to a short time ago the salary
roll on the Philippine reservation wai
$97,000 a month. Colonel Edwards
found it possible to cut this down to
$57,000. He lopped off $40,000 worth
of heads and the show is going along
just the same.
BITTLDIN'GS OF BAMBOO.
The argument is made that the ad
vertising of the native tribes brings
crowds ahat would not otherwise visit
the Philippine exhibit, and that' these
visitors then view the commercial ex

the populace is posted and knows how

are and how high Is their civilization,
but the F.ast and Europe, not t?o close,
f orra their opinions from just what they

pensive. All of them are attractive,
though.
San Francisco Is much Interested In
the success of this exhibit. The com
mercial exploitation and growth, of
the archipelago mean added business
for that city. Already the Pacific
Coast metropolis has an Important
trada with the islands and Just such
a commercial display as is made here
will increase>it if that display Is seen
by and explained to the right people.
The savages are not going to bring a
trade boom to either San Francisco or
the Philippines.-
The Macabebe scouts drill beauti
fully and are much 'admired, but their
usefulness as fighters has never been
well established. One of them was
observed in a shooting gallery on the
Pike trying vainly to hit .a life-size
rabbit. The young girl behind the
railing, noting his lack of success,
kindly showed him how to make use
of the sights on the gun, something
he had evidently never mastered. As
he shut both eyes every time he pulled
the trigger he met with no better suc
cess after being Instructed.
Colonel Edwards, on being asked
why the uncivilized tribes at the Phil
ippine reservation were not taught
something of American ways, said he
did not believe in them learning any
thing American â that they knew too
much now. It Is feared that, when
they return home neither " the tribal
idea of morals nor the styles in spring
neckwear will be one bit improved by
them?
The natural idea of a Philippine ex
hibit would be to attract the eyes of
the civilized world to the islands in a
beneficial Eer.se; to awaken .commercial
interests to the fact that great trade
possibilities lie in the archipelago; to
put these insular possessions In their
best light before the people of the coun
try whose suzerainty they now ac-

ht raided as "dog- eaters" and "savage
head hunters." D05 feasts by these
harmless appearing terrors have ac
tu&Uy been advertised and the main
th;::g you hear about the Philippine
eshibit is that the Ygorrotes are pre
pcrmg for another dog dinner, that
several fine dogs are being fattened
for the Ygorrotes, that invitations
have been issued to So-and-So â
prominent visitors, or perhaps exposi
tion officials â to witness a dog-eating
carnival by the "savage Ygorrotes."
There was a lull in the dog-eating
manifestos for a while and the serious
subject of whether these timid, home
tick appearing "scourges of the moun
tain wilds," wha have always gone
r^ked here, save for a breechclout,
should wear trousers. This question
â¢ was taken up at Washington and
hurled broadcast over the country and
then died out, leaving the "terrors"
etill with their fig leaves, and the
â¢ nauseating dog diet material waa
â¢ fallen back upon.
During all this week the finest ex
hibit of commercial wealth ever made
by a tingle foreign country â if the
Philippines may be called a foreign
cour-try^-has lain practically unher
alded. The money it cost to get it here
has been the instrument, mainly, in
brirgiEg the Ygorrote and his uncivil
ised brothers into prominence.
The St. Louis Humane Society, com
posed of a large number of refined citi
zens of the exposition city, tried to
handle the dog-eating proposition when
it first betas to gain prominence, but !
. it was balked because the Ygorrote vil

within the fair grounds. The mem

dogs, for the canines' death at thel

HEAD HUNTERS."
The expenditure of this fortune In
public funds has brought the insular
government a splendid exploitation of
the "savagrs lloro," the "dog-eating
Virorrote" and the "Filipino midpets"
â the last named being scarcely worth
tny considerable expenditure for ad-

in all the islands. To sum it all up

one of the greatest of displays â its
usefulness, 10 a large extent â is be
ing Bacriticed to the/rupidity of a few
fchownien. for whose immediate ben
efit â it -would almost seemâ this vast
expenditure has bten made. \
No matter who is rijrht â those who
support the Government in its ac
(juisitlon of the archipelago or those
who oppose it â there are great com
mercial possibilities in the islands and
â¢Ae business men of the United States
should grasp them. Th- Philippine
display here shows these possibilities;
but what are commercial possibilities

Threatens to Cut Throat of Man Who
Called Him Uar.
NEW ALBANY. Aug. 13. â During a
political debate in this city between
Congressman Champ Clark of Missouri
and Congressman B. Landis of
Indiana the former threatened to cut
the throat of a man in the audience
who called him a liar.
Clark had attacked former Gov
ernor William Taylor of Kentucky for
seeking a refuge in Indiana and. re
ferring to him as a murderer, said he
ought to be hanged. His remark was
challenged by a man near the stage.
Clark walked to the edsre of the plat
form and shouted to the man:
"If you will walk outside the tent
and call me a liar I will cut your
throat." -*
The man arose, but was pulled back
into his seat, and the debate waa
quickly closed. Intense excitement
prevailed among the 5000 people In
the audience, but no further trouble
ensued. ,
Politics has made a few men and un
made a great many.

The vots Tras canvassed here to-day
by the board appointed for the pur

night.
As a result of the vote accepting
th# proposition the contemplated
strike will not take place. Instead the
mines la the Southwest, a majority of
Â¦which have been idle, will resume
work on full time.
Workmen Voto to Adopt Wage Sched
ule Submitted by Operators.
MIXERS WILIi NOT STRIKE.
Many of the spectators, including the
oincials of the District Government,
protested against the continuance of
the racing in view of the tragedy, but
the officials in charge declined to stop
the sport, saying it was inexpedient,
as many had come from other cities to
take part, and that the regatta was the
result of long laid plans, in which"
many outside interests were concerned.
There was much criticism of this
course.
Only a iew of the thousands of per
sons who lined the shore witnessed the
accident, but the policemen set to work
to recover the bodies.

Powell Paper Company of this city;

C. A. Stewart, I. A. Woulfe and Wil
liam Lederer.
The capsized launch was the Recrea
tion, owned by Drs. Stewart and Wag
ner.
During the first race the launch got
in the way of the eight-oared shells
and its wash was such that the officials
reprimanded its crew and ordered the
boat out of the way. There was some
show of resentment at this order, and
the launch headed for the shore, but
miscalculated its course, and striking
the strong undertow caused by a mill
race rocked for a moment. The pas
sengers rushed to one side an/ the
launch turned turtle.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 13.â Ten per
sons were drowned as the result of the
capsizing of a naptha launch on the
Potomac River off Georgetown, dur
ing the annual Potomac regatta, this
afternoon. Four ethers who were on
the launch escaped. All but one lived
in this city. The dead:

RENO, Nev., Aug. 13.â Sparks is now
undergoing the novel experience of
having a boycott placed upon its post
office. The people of the new railroad
division town adjoining this city Mon
day held a meeting and resolved that
In the future they will not have their
mail received there, neither will they
mail letters in the new town. The ac
tion was taken after much complaint
of unsatisfactory service in the deliv
ery and sending of letters from the
town. Postmaster Summerfleld de
pends for his salary upon the cancella
tion. The action of the citizens will de
prive him of his Income, and if present
conditions continue the Government
will be compelled to abolish the office,
notwithstanding the fact that the town
has a population of 1200 people. Boxes
have been established at the different
business houses. The people deposit
their letters in these and they are sent
to Reno to be mailed. The Reno post
office Is noticing: the increase in busi
ness caused by this action.

It Is Judge Parker's purpose to elim
inate politics upon that occasion, but
plans have already been laid to hold a
public reception, so that the Western
Democrats will be able to make his ac
quaintance.
Hoke Smith, Secretary of the Interior
under President Cleveland, accom
panied by his son Marion, visitod Rose
mount this afternoon. He told Judge
Parker that he would make a number
of specehes during the campaign. To

sult.

return to reason."
The Auckland Harbor Board has
under consideration an elaborate
scheme of harbor improvements,
based on proposals recently submitted
by the board's engineer, "W. H. Hamer.
The first visit to Auckland of Lord
Plunket, the new Governor of the col
ony, took place on July 16, under the
most favorable circumstances. The
weather, which had been damp and
gloomy, cleared up and the day was all
that could be desired. The reception ac
corded to Lord Plunket should be an
assurance to his Excellency that the
warmest of welcomes will await Lady
Plunket and himself when his duties
will permit them to take up their resi
dence in New Zealand. Lord Plunket
was accompanied on his visit by Mr.
Beddon, the Premier.
The second session of the present
Parliament was opened by Lord
Plunket on June 28. Mr. Seddon,
the Premier, on account of in health
was not expected, but. he was present
for duty and looking remarkably well
and vigorous. Anent this the Welling
ton correspondent of the Melbourne
Argus wrote:
"Ajb Ions as he (Mr. Seddon) was
well the Inhuman' and Immoral
method of legislation by exhaustion,
as it is commonly termed, has been
one of his favorite devices. It has
been no uncommon thine for the
House of Representatives, which be
gins its sittings at 2:80 in the after
noon, to work for an average of two
hours after midnight during a session
of four or five months, and during the
last few weeks of the session. ' when
the most Important bills and the most
unpresentable Jobs are going: through,
several consecutive sittings will often
last till 4 or 5 in the morning. Mr.
Seddon finds in the somnolent and
fuddled heads the listless and jaded
tempers which result from this pro
cess, material far more plastic to his
purpose than a House in which the
ordinary allowance of sleep has main
tained the ordinary degree of alert
ness. For years the brutal practice
has continued.' but now, , not out of
deference to public opinion or to the
protests of members themselves, but
because his own health will no longer
stand it, Mr. Seddon has consented to
a change. For a month, at any rate,
the experiment of early closing is to
be tried, the House meeting at 10:30
a. xn. on two days in every week onft
rising at 10:30 p. m. Members who
tended by 34.000 people, who assembled
to witness the first of a Beries of Inter
national or test football matches be
tween Great Britain and Australia, the
result of which was a victory for the
visitors by 17 points to nil. The match
was a most exciting one. In the first
half the Australians put in the more
aggressive work, and were more fre
quently on the visitors' line than their
opponents were in the territory of the
Australian team, though the defense
was so very 6olid and the tackling so
certain that neither side was able to
gain, at the precise moment, the few
yards which would have given one
team the advantage in results over the
other.
XEW ZEALAND NOTES.
G<.r.eral Sir Edivard Hutton, G. O. C.
of -the Federal forces, made some
Bt^te/nents that created a decided sen
vlition and uneasiness throughout the
country. He insists that fully Â£500.000
must be spent upon stores and equip
ment before the "security of Australia
by land can be assured." On this topic
General Hutton wrote In* the follow
ing disturbing: strain:
'.'It has been shown that a further
special warlike store vote of Â£443,683
is required for stores, and that to pro
vide the complete military system as
stated an annual outlay of Â£C00,419
is. necessary.
iThis expenditure trill provide for
a field force, complete in all its de
tcils, and fit for active operations of
IS'.SSl men and sixty guns upon a
peace footing and 27,753 men and
eighty-four gur.s upon a war footing.
It trill further provide a garrison force
cf 11,752 men and twenty-six guns,
exclusive of the armament of the fixed
d'e/eriEes, with behind them an Ini
Â¦ jxfrtant auxiliary force of approxi
â¢ mately 29,000 riflemen furnished by
â¢ the. rifle clubs. The troops thus pro
vided are the least number which
.would afford reasonable security
against invasion, and which would
suffice for the present protection of
Australian Interests."
..â¢General Hutton concluded as fol
lows:
.*' "It is impossible to raw the.mili
tary situation in Australia, in face of
the momentous changes taking placÂ»
.^n thfe balance of power in the East,
"without grave misgivings. Thevictories
of the Japanese arms within the last
f.our months have astounded the whole
Â¦f'-ivilized world by their brilliancy and
â¢ l?y their astonishing rapidity. The fu
ture and: far-reaching results of the
war have yet to be felf, but it Is safe

The Sydney Herald, July 8, eatd^ One
of the fastest passages that has "ever
been accomplished across the Pacific
on the run between San Francisco and
Sydney was made by the Oceanic liner
Ventura, which arrived here shortly
after 3 o'clock yesterday morning. The
time occupied on the voyage "was
twenty days and twelve hours, the
actual steaming time being eighteen
days and twenty-three hours. The run
to Auckland was made in fifteen days
and sixteen hours. After discharging
her New Zealand cargo the Ventura
continued her voyage to Sydney, mak
ing the run across the Tasman Sea in
three days and seven hours. She sails
again on Monday, the 18th test.

VEXTURA'S PAST RUN.
Major General Sir Edward Hutton
will return to England early in No
vember. He will not seek an exten
sion of his present engagement r*s Q.
O. C. of the Federal foroes. Judging
by the remarks which he makes hi bin
annual report, however, he considers
that his successor should be an of
ficer of the imperial forces.
Although admitting that thens art.
more pressing requirements In the
Federal defense system. than the es
tablishment of a military colleges, Ma
jor General Sir Edward Hutton, in his
cxnual report, again urges that such
an Institution Is wanted in Australia.
The Sydney Herald of July 4, com
menting editorially on the financial
statement lately Issued by the Federal
Government, says:
"Once again the official statement
of the public accounts has falsified the
anticipations of the Treasurer. Little
more than a month ago the country
was told by him that he expected the
year would close with a debit of Â£200.
000. The amount of the deficiency on
the consolidated revenue account Is
Â£524,000. A year ago the debit was
Â£484.000. The Government has spent
Its ample Income for the year of
Â£11,458.000 and Â£40,000 In addition.
That represents tha measure of econ
omy of which the Treasurer has been
boasting for many months past How
the result compares with the perform
ances of some previous yean may be
seen from the net revenue and ex
penditure as given by Mr. Coghlan:
NÂ«t NÂ«t
Revenue. Expenditure*. Drtlcleacy.

13!H ... 11.453,000 11.B8S.O0O 1S5.0W
The revenue Increased In five years
by about 20 per cent, exclusive of Fed
eral drafts, and it has given the State
Government about Â£7,000,000 in excess
of what was required in the previous
quinquenniumâ yet that did not suffice.
The Government has spent more than
Â£500,000 beyond this amount, converting
a credit balance on the consolidated
revenue fund in the meantime into a
debit of Â£524,000.
The report called forth strong 1 news
paper comments on the situation and
sharp attacks on those deemed re
sponsible therefor. Tho Melbourne
Airus of July 4 said editorially:
'â¢Major General Sir Edward Kutton
has not minced matters or attempted
to gloss over errors of policy or defects
of administration. His candid, straight
spoken n-ords give every legislator and
elector an opportunity of understanding
the present condition of our defenses
and what is needed to bring them up to
the required standard of efficiency.
â¢ â¢ â¢ Politicians absorbed in the par
ty struggles of local public life seldom
think of the seemingly remote chances
of external attack, but as the Pacific
Ocean is fast becoming the storm cen
ter of international politics Australia,
for its own sake and for the sake of the
empire, should have its defenses all in
order."
The Sydney Herald of July 5 also
spoke out as follows:
"Australia would be helpless in face
of a force of some 50,000 troops which
had been enabled to land. If such an
invasion were to take place to-morrow
we have no men to meet the enemy.
That is a sufficiently startling state
ment, especially in view of the devel
opments in the Far East. Supposing
that the war now raging there should
end In the strengthening of Japan's po
sition, how shall we in Australia fare?
Our immigration laws are directly cal
culated to hurt the pride of a great na
tion. TVe keep out individuals by means
of our vigilant customs officers, but it
will be impossible to divert an army
from its purpose in this way. Yet, fail
ing the protection of the British fleet,
we have nothing except our intelligent
customs officers to oppose to invasion.
Once the enemy is landed in sufficient
force we have no resource. Our citizen
army, according to General Hutton, is
inadequate, and it will not be adequate
until somewhere about 1908. Even then
the efficiency of the force is dependent
upon the obedience of the civil authori
ties to military advice.
"MeanTv-hile the blame for all that
we deplore in our military unprepar
edness lies chiefly with the various
Ministers we hava had in the com
monwealth. They have all been" too
much occupied with anything rather
than Australian defense and they
have at the bidding of the party now
in power submissively accepted cuts
from the pruning knife, which direct
ed against gold lace at headquarters
have struck home in the efficiency
and enthusiasm of local defense. Is
It too late to look for a reversal of
this bad Federal form?"
MINISTRY PROMISES.
*Â¦ An animated debate took place in
the Senate July 13 in reference to the
inefficient squipment of the Australian
forces. The Minister for Defense said
that most of the things urged as nec
essary by General Hutton would be
provided for in the next estimates.
across the Isthmus of Panama, will
materially alter the existing: political
and commercial situation in the Pa
cific.
"It is certain that commercial su
premacy in the Pacific will be the aim
of the leading naval and military
powers and that Australian interests
mu?t thereby be seriously compro
mised, unless effectively secured by a
rer^onable measure of military de
fense."

A month of married life is enough
for Myrtle May Bosworth, who yester

She charges him with being unclean

to have consisted in the use of vile
epithets and striking her in a way to
leave her cheek black and blue. She
says that his income amounts to $150
a month, a third of which she asks
the court to award her.
Cruelty to his wife is charged
against Edward D. "Woodward by Alice
M. Woodward, who yesterday began
suit for divorce. : They were married
September 8 of last year and ten days
after the ceremony he took her to a
spiritualist meeting and then accused
her of undue familiarity with strange
men. On several occasions' he Is said
to have called her vile' names and
wrongfully charged her with unfaith
fulness. sT; -:'.\ :'*Ji,'
John Robinson Wood, former pay
ing teller of the Crocker-Woolworth
Bank, yesterday answered- the suit for
divorce brought by his wife. Ada
Matthews Wood. He denies the
charge that he had been guilty of acts
of unfaithfulness with Louise C. Tyler,
the postmistress of Mill Valley. He
also denies that he owns any prop
erty excepting personal effects worth
about $250. The home in Mill Val
ley, he says, was levied upon for debt
by Charles H. Athearn and sold for
55000. He still owes $3850 to vari
ous persons and is out of employment,
having los|. his position because of the
charges made by his wife in her suit.
Wood pleads that he is unable to pay
his wife alimony.
Kathleen O'Hare filed a sensational
answer to the complaint of her hus
band, Eugene O'Hare, who sued her
fcr divorce on the ground that she was
addicted to the intemperate use of in
toxicating liquors. She denied the
charge ' and accused him of brutal
treatment. She recited that they were
married in Brooklyn on May 1, 1S96,
and that six children were born to
them. Of the "six' only one survives,
a boy 7 years old. The other five died
between November 17 and 27, 1903,
and, the wife eays that he has falsely
charged her with being responsible for
their death by neglect. She declares
that '.when' the children Averc taken ill
in October , and she informed him of
their condition he . said that he did
not "Care a d- â -n whether or not
they all died." .She charges him with
denying his paternity of the -children

Rev. Jacob Voorsanger yesterday
morning celebrated his eighteenth an
niversary as rabbi of Temple Emanu-
El. The synagogue was crowded with
worshipers, who listened to an eloquent
discourse by the rabbi. In the after
noon at his home he received the con
gratulations of many friends and was
presented with many tokens of esteem.
â¢ Rabbi Voorsanger's address was both
retrospective and prospective, dealing
not only with the condition of the Jew
and the problem confronting him in
this coutnry, but also with the Ameri
can people as a whole, describing
America as "a country in the making."
He made a study, of the eighth chapter
of Ezekiel to lead up to a study of
present day conditions as they affect
the people of America, saying in part:
"There seems to be a misunderstand
ing as to what constitutes the religious
standing of a country. . It is usually
identified with the prosperity of the
churches. In this chapter we find that

the elders visit a prophet with a view
to ascertaining how they can restore
the cult of their fathers In exile. They
had prospered exceedingly well, but
somehting undefined seemed to be lack*
Ins. and they came to the prophet. Ho
gave no direct answer, but in a vision
he Is carried to â¢ Jerusalem and there
discovers that the destruction of all
the elements of nationality has so com
pletely unsettled the pebpfe that they
say, 'God has left the country,' and re
lapse, into their former idolatry.
"This Is the charge that religious
pessimism, usually unobservant of the
trend of the times, makes against
Judaism in particular and religion in
America in general. So far as Judaism
is concerned it is only necessary to
point to Us achievements in the last
fifty years to repudiate the charge. ] It
is true that in many respects its ex
ternal attributes have changed. It is
impossible to assume that a people can
adapt itself to new social and political
environments without undergoing
changes. The removal of a people from
one base to another Introduces not
merely a physical change. The change
becomes more radical when we con
sider that removal means a change of
language, of habits, of thought and of
national consciousness and a gradual
alienation from the former life. All this
has taken place in the brief career of
the -American Jew, and his period of
permanent settlement has come Just us
slowly as the corresponding period in
the life, of the American people gener
ally. Either as Americans or Jews we
are still a people in the making."

arch3 Militant of the United States

MOVES
The Russian fleet of warships which for months has
been bottled up at Port Arthur and for which the world
had nothing but jest and gibe and ungenerous specula
tion has at last escaped and is prowling the Pacific. If
the Bear effects a junction, of this fleet with that of the
Baltic and the Vladivostok squadron the doughty sailors
of the Mikado may have reason to understand that war
after all is a two-sided affair. The world may yet be wit
ness of. a great modern sea battle.
Chief of Police Wittman has suggested to the Super
visors several proposed charter amendments that are de
signed to improve the efficiency of the Police Depart

must accept municipal conditions as they are created.
The suggestions of the Chief of Police should be
adopted. If we must tolerate influences that call for in
creased police protection we are at least entitled to be
guarded against. the criminal classes that have apparently
the connivance if not the support of our local au
thorities.

$50,000 on one royal party at her coun

sities are well known to all the young
nobility swells and to enterprising
ladies who fancy a hand at bridge.
Although her husband is the possessor
of many thousands of acres and four
or five of the finest residences in the
country â all of them good enough for
the reception of kings and oriental
potentates â he is mortgaging them
heavily to support the extravagances
of hi3 fair Duchess. The Duchess in
order to satisfy her craving for gamb

disposing of her jewelry. Herds of cat

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALi.,
ft HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON, July 31. â Much
surprise has been occasioned by the
announcement that the Prince of
Wales Is goins in for horse racing.
He has heretofore given such little
r evidence of possessing "sporting
Â¦ blood" that it is about the last thing:
that was expected of him. Among
his intimate friends, however, it is
stated that no genuine love of the turf
has impelled him to take this course,
but a desire to win popularity with
the masses. At present their attitude
toward him is one of indifference not
unmlngled with contempt and is in
striking contrast to the feeline enter
tained for his father when he occu
pied the position of heir to the throne.
This may be in a measure due to his
general aloofness from all that con
cerns them. Laying corner-stones,
opening fashionable bazaars and at
tendance at similar functions pro
duce little effect on the crowd. Very
noticeable was the cool reception ac
corded the Prince and Princess when
they accompanied the King and Queen
"the other day to lay the foundation
Btone of a city hospital. As they rode
through Holborn, where men who
â¢â¢â¢play the races" abound, not a hat
Â¦was lifted nor a cheer raised for
them. It is, something more than a
coincidence that the Prince should de
clare his intention of seeking a career
on the turf so shortly after this inci
dent. He is emulating his father's
example, but whether he will be
S equally successful in making himself
1 a favorite with the racing public re
mains to be seen.
â¢ The Princess of "Wales is and al
ways has been opposed to horse rac
.ing because she saw in it an element
of reckless gambling. Queen Alexan
dra has the same feeling, but King
Kdward, unlike his heir, has insisted
.r'^vays on being master of his own
household. He knew ivhat his sub
jects liked and whether he^was run
ning a horse or not lie always had a
'"bit on" every race reckoned import
ant In the racing calendar.
The threatened withdrawal of such
men as Lord Dunraven, Leopold de
Rothschild, Leonard Brassey and Sir
Waldie Griffith from racing would also
J appear to have influenced the Prince.
I These patrons of the turf have been
pomplaining of the King's lack of
practical interest in racing matters
'lately. He goes to all the fashionable
meetings and keeps a few "crocks"
In training, but what is wanted are
his colors at classic races. He has
been practicing economy since he
came to the throne and moreover he
tells his friends plainly that his pub
lic duties make so much demand upon
his time that he cannot afford to look
after training stables.
Early In the season he was obliged to
release "Danny" Maher from his en
gagement because he had not suffi
cient horses in training to give the
young American a chance of living up

Sven Hedln describes walking in a
sandstorm in the Tibetan Desert as
being "like wadingr against' running
water or liquid mud."
THE Japanese have startled Russia by entering'a
Chinese neutral port, and cutting out a Russian
warship that had sought seclusion and; refuge there.
At the first blush this was taken as a violation of. inter
national law and neutral rights. But was it? The Rus
sian warship was part of the armed 'fleet in~Port Arthur.
The Russians confess, that she entered the Chinese port
for the purpose of notifying Skrydlofly of the .Vladivos
tok'fleet, that the Port Arthur fleet had escaped, for the
purpose of making a junction with him. This in itself
was the misuse of 'a neutral port^for a war purpose, to
the distinct disadvantage of Japan. After, accomplishing
it, the Russian ship was "disarmed" by removing the
breech blocks from her guns, with the intention of lying
indefinitely in a -neutral port. The Japanese followed
her in, captured her and took her out into open water
under the flag of Japan, adding her to their fleet.
The ideas of Russia seem to be strangely muddled in
regard to neutrality, and the shift and change of the
character of her ships. She brought auxiliary ships out
of the Black Sea, under a merchant flag, and when they
were through the Dardanelles immediately armed them
and began preying upon neutral commerce in the Red
Sea. This was in violation of treaty/stipulations which
forbid the Dardanelles to Russian warships. It was
characteristic of Russia, however, and was what the
parties to the treaty might have expected. The ships so
used had no higher character than pirates, and would
have been treated as such. by Great Britain had they
continued to make seizures.
Taking refuge in neutral Chinese ports, under a construc
tive disarmament, is part of the same policy. The warship
used for that purpose could not be held there by China.
She could recoal and revictual and even take on war
stores and be ready to rebreech her guns and slip out
when the coast was clear to prey upon neutral ships, or
resume her place in the Russian fleet in an action on
the open sea. She was more dangerous to Japan than
if she were on open water, for she lurked in ambush,
ready at any time to strike. If the Russian use of neu
tral ports were accepted the entire fleet might sequester
itself temporarily in Chinese ports, take off the breech
blocks and then rearm by replacing them, and steam
out at the expiration of the limit fixed by international
law for armed ships.
It is not intended by the law of nations that a bellig
erent shall make such use of neutral ports. Especially
is it not to be permitted in the case of Chinese ports.
China has no navy with which to defend and enforce
her neutral rights in her sea ports. Her posjtion is
peculiar. Russia has been ready at any time to declare
war against her. Since the opening of the struggle with
Japan Russia has ceaselessly nagged China in the
hope of provoking some overt act that would be an ex
cuse for such action. The right of China to protect her
frontier from invasion by the contending forces has
been denied by Russia in a protest against the appear
ance of General Ma's army on the border. In every
possible way Russia has sought to embroil China.
Now, under the preposterous claim to the use of Chi
nese ports for disarmed warships, Russia- could' put
into them her entire fleet, ready for a declaration of
war, which would be instantly followed by the reduction
of every Chinese sea port. This would give her an im
mense advantage over Japan, and it would be gained by
a palpable and atrocious trick.
Under the circumstances Japan has done just what
any other nation would have done. , She has punished
the trick by capturing a ship that was too cowardly to'
fight on open water, and has added it to her fleet. In
stead of violating the neutrality of China she has pro
tected it, by exposing a-trick that put it in peril. It may
be expected that Russia will make a florid protest to
the powers. But a nation that asks international equity
must come blameless herself, and with clean hands. Thi3
Russia cannot do, and no matter under what diplomatic
verbiage the answer may be softened it is safe to say
that the nations will fail to get excited over the incident.
Japan has an adequate defense and will present it with
the force that has become a characteristic of her states
manship.
The action itself was another evidence of Japanese
courage and adventure and promptness, and the verdict
of the lovers of fair play is that she served Russia as
she deserved.
RUSSIA'S views on: contraband o f war. coupled
: with the evident purpose of the Czar to continue
Â¦'Â¦-Â¦Â«. ;t . h * Â°P eration of the volunteer fleet in the Pacific
Ocean on. the lines that have proved so annoying to
the British in the Red Sefc, have become primary ques
tions of: the hour for discussion by British statesmen.
The problem created by Russia's tremendous sea activ
ity, vastly increased by the release of the Port Arthur
fleet and the, impending movement of the Baltic battle
ships, has. become one of grave moment to the British
Foreign Office, and well it may be. Britain has infin
itely more to lose from the predatory fleets of the Rus
sians than all the other sea powers combined.
It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that the subject
of contraband has become a theme of agitated debate in
the House of Lords and in the House of Commons, that
Lord . Lansdowne has been placed on his mettle by
pointed queries, that representations bordering on the
undiplomatic have been made to St. Petersburg, and
that the Pandora's box of the Dardanelles has been con
sidered fit food for the wisdom of The Hague Tribunal.
British -.traders are menaced far more seriously than
they ever were before in this generation.
Some unwarranted surprise has been expressed that
practically all the seizures made by the Russians in the
Red Sea have been those of British ships, and a like
condition will follow in the Pacific Ocean if the Russians
persist in their policy. This is to be expected because
of the overwhelming preponderance of British tonnage
over that of other nations.
The marvelous carrying trade of Great Britain and her
colonies t explains at a glance the trepidation of London.*
While Germany and other maritime nations have in
creased their carrying trade very largely in the last few
years, Britain has kept pace with the forward movement
and still holds her marveloui supremacy on the seas.
Great Britain owns for commercial purposes 7699
steamers, of I3,999Â»2i8 tons burden, and 1537 sailing ves
sels of 1,392.132 tons burden. Add to this enormous
capacity of the mother country the trading ships owned
in the British colonies, 1088 steamers of 867,309 tons
burden and 926 sailing vessels of 322,186 tons burden,
and we have the magnificent total of 8787 steamers of
14,866,527 tons burden and 2463 sailing vessels of 1,714,
318 tons under the control of the British Empire and en
couraged by. its imperial promise of protection.
It is' little wonder, therefore, that the British Parlia
ment sees, in the sea policy of the Czar potentialities of
tremendous damage to the British carrying trade both in
Europe and the Orient. Nor is Germany to be left out
of calculation as a vigorous objector to the free and
easy interpretation of contraband by the Russians. Ger
many's flag floats over 1483 steamers of 2,891,869 tons
burden and she is fourth on the list of proprietors of
sailing vessels in the world's carrying trade. The
United States comes third in the zone of danger. with
1266 steamships of 2,440,794 tons burden, and we are
second on the roll of sailing ships. While most of our
carrying trade is coastwise or confined to the lakes, we
have still an appreciable interest in the controversy
which so agitates England. It will be well, therefore,
for the Czar to count the cost when he sets his fighting
ships freÂ« on predatory missions.

ABAL.ONB SHELLSâ W. I*. City. In
order to polish abalone shells the outer
coating must first be removed. Thl3
is done by placing the shells In lye
made by boiling strong ashes and then
boiling the shells from six to seven
hours, or longer if necessary, after
which they must soak in the liquid.
After boiling they must frequently bo
washed In water. Then the shells ara
dried In sawdust and when thoroughly
dried the surface is rubbed with a
mixture of tripoll and turpentine ap
plied by means of a pieoe of wash
leather. After this application has
dried It should be rubbed off. The
shells are then rubbed with very fins
dry tripoll and lastly some olive oil
is rubbed In and then finished by rub-.
bing with a chamois.
DRIED MUSHROOMSâ a K O.,
Natlvldad, Monterey County, CaL Tha
following is the method for drying
mushrooms: Freshly gathered small
mushrooms are peeled, the stems cut
off and the fur is entirely scraped off.
They are then arranged on a tin or
dish so that they do not touch and
are dried as gradually as possible in
a gentle oven. When dry they are
put In tin canisters and stored where
they will be secure from dampness.
Tibetan Women.
The traveler cannot fall to be struck
by the hardness and misery of the Tib
etan woman's lot. Among some of the
tribes wives are secured by tha simple
method of making a foraging expedi
tion on some weaker tribe and seizing
as many women as may be desired.
This practice, however boldly under
taken, is likely to mean the loss of sev
eral lives, and is adopted only in cases
of the direst necessity. The following
method' Is more generally employed:
When a warrior, surfeited with glory,
desires a wife he waits upon the father
of the girl who has attracted his eye
and makes an offer of marriage. The
father, after weighing the matter care
fully â for a refusal is liable to provoke
a long and disastrous feud â names a
price which he thinks consistent with
the charms and general usefulness of
his daughter. Then ensues a scene of
the shrewdest bargaining.
The wishes or inclination of the wo
man are never consulted, but the bar
gaining goes on for days, and even
weeks, until a final settlement has been
arrived at. The preliminary bartering
having been completed, on the day ap
pointed for the wedding the woman Is
placed either in the upper limbs of a
tree, -while her male relatives remain
on the lower branches, armed with
thorn-sticks â or in the back part of her
father's hut, while the relatives guard
the entrance in a similar manner/ The
suitor rides up on his horse, arrayed In
wedding finery, and^announces his In
tention of seizing his bride. In fact
this is love making of the most stren
uous kind, requiring ardor and courage

Sawyer's Whisky.
Among the old miners of SIskiyou
County a man can get worse whisky
at Sawyer's bar than in any other
place on earth. This is the belief of the
gold diggers of that section, and that
faith is accepted as orthodox.
Regularly every Christmas Billy X,
foreman of the Oro Fino mine, takes
his layoff down at Sawyer's. Once the
superintendent asked him why he al
ways selected that place for his vaca
tion. ?: v--
"I want to have one yearly drunk,"
said Billy, "and I want to know just
when I am drunk, so that I may enjoy
the sensation."
"Well, can't you enjoy the sensation
in any other portion of the county or
State or continent?", asked the super
intendent.
"No. When I'm drinking Sawyer's
whisky and it begins to taste good,
then I know I'm drunk."
of the most ardent sort on tha part of
the suitor, for in order to reach his
bride he is compelled to run the gaunt
let of the male relatives, who beat him
unmercifully. If he Is able to elude hta
opponents and braves their chastise
ment, on touching the foot of the girl
he is welcomed into the family and
complimented on the ardor of his pas
sion. Should he fall, he finds Mmâif
in the awkward predicament of being
both wifeless and out of tha presents
he has made during the preliminary]
negotiations.'
Although a parent may have sold &
woman to one man, it does not prevent
his redlsposlng of her to any suitor
who may come after, and who is looked
upon as legitimate a husband as thÂ«
first one. All the husbands contribute
to the wife's support. â Outing.
Economy.
n Senator "Jim" Fair had two marked
characteristicsâ economy and love of
Joking. He never forgot frugality in
his extensive business, and he even
made his own economy a subject for
humor.
Once while puttering around over the
Comstock he slipped and started feet
first down a deep, narrow shaft There
was a long", continuous wooden ladder
reaching to the bottom, with Its every
twelfth rung of iron to strengthen the
structure. Down this he sped.
"When I found myself sliding down
toward the center of earth," said the
Senator, who used to enjoy telling the
story, "I thought it was time to begin
doin' something. Bo I - commenced to
grab at the ladder rungs. As I went
down I broke every single one of them
wooden sticks. This checked the speed
of my fall, and I landed 'bout a thou
sand feet below, badly shook up but
not hurt."
"But what did you do when you came
to the iron rungs?" he was asked.
"Oh, I just skipped 'em. Couldn't af
ford to break 'em. "Wood was cheap,
but iron, was then durned dear on the
Comstock."

"I cannot believe that he Is dead,"
she said last night. "I am sure that
he will come back to me." Then the
thought that her husband might be ly
ing dead at the bottom of a bluff or
wandering frenzied about the hills
comes to her and she moans pitifully.
She reproaches herself continually for
having let him go alone.
1 Preston was well thought of by the
railroad pepole. He has been engaged
in the same work for years. The
United Railroads Company has sent a
man to aid in the search.
Mrs. Preston has had scarcely any
sleep since her husband left home. Rel
atives who are caring for her fear for
her reason. Every time she hears her
doorbell ring she expects to see her
husband. She still clings to the hope
that he lives. â¢ *
The supposition is that Preston has
thrown himself from one of the high
bluffs near Pacific Grove, or has wan
dered Into the hills. At a late hour his
wife had no word from the search
party.
Is Henry Preston alive or dead? A
week ago he wrote to his wife at 206
Fillmore street, in this city, a letter
from Pacific Grove, in which he told
her that he intended to end his life.
Telegrams were quickly sent to the
place by the anxious woman, but no
trace of Henry Preston, alive or dead,
could be found. Two detectives are
now searching that neighborhood for a
clew to his -whereabouts. Meanwhile,
the v.ife is worn out with watching
and waiting.
Preston was employed in the main
tainance of way department of the
United Railroads. For some time, his
wife says, he has been acting strange
ly. This she attributes to overwork.
Two weeks ago he started on a vaca
tion. Mrs. Preston has not seen him
since.
With the letter from Pacific Grove^ â
evidently written by a man whose
mind was unbalancedâ Preston en
closed his watch and some Masonic
emblems.

Altmann, will not assume his new du
ties until to-morrow, when he will file
his resignation as a member of the
Park Commission. Altmann was born
in this city, and after leaving the pub
lic schools devoted himself to the study
of art. After several years of study at
the California School of Design he took
a course in the National School of Fine
Arts in Paris under Gerome. In 1S98 he
returned to this city and was appointed
professor of perspective and sketching
at the Mark Hopkins Institute. He is
also a member of the advisory board of
the- "California Landmarks League.
While Park Commissioner he has made
many suggestions that have resulted In
improvements at Golden Gate Park.
Altmann is highly regarded by the
Mayor, as is evidenced by his selection
two years ago for the park commls
sionership. The present members of
the Board of Education are greatly
pleased that Altmann will sit with
them in their deliberations. Altmann
was recently elected head of the draw-
Ing department In the Lowell High
School, which post will now be vacated
by his acceptance of the school direc
torship.

AARON AL.TMAIX. V.'HO HAS BEEN [

Roncovieri told Kellogg that one of
the reauests made by the Board of
Education was for an appropriation
for an additional wing to the Hamil
ton School building, but the request
had been turned down, as had many
others.
"V."e would like very much to estab
lish some new classes," said Roncovie
ri, "but lack of funds will prevent it.
Nearly all the schools are turning
away pupils owing to lack of room
and it is a marvel to me where they
all go. I presume that many find
their way to private schools. I really
do not see how we can establish
any more new classes, although I sup
pose that something must be done in
cases where they are absolutely re
quired. For the present, however, we
shall have to worry along as best we
can. The msitake is that no provi
sion is made here for the natural in
crease In attendance, as is done In
New York, where the School Directors
must provide annually 25,000 addi
tional desks for that purpose."
Kellogg urged the establishment of
several new classes in order to care
for pupils vÂ»ho applied for admission,
but Roncovieri said this would be im
possible,, owing to the inadequate ap
propriation for the support of the
schools as made by the Board of Su
pervisors in the last municipal bud
get.
A. E. Kellopg, principal of the
Hamilton Grammar School, yesterday
visited Alfred Roncovieri, president of
the Board of Education, and informed
him that the school had turned away
hundreds of children who sought ad
mittance because there were no ac
commodations either in the way of
classrooms or desks for any more new
pupils.
Acting on a request of the Supervis
ors' Charter Amendment Committee
made on Friday last. City Engineer
Woodward and Assistant City Engineer
Morser yesterday began the drafting of
a charter amendment relative to the
procedure in making grade changes.
The officials named say that the exist
ing charter provisions on this subject
are not comprehensive enough to cover
many cases that occur almost daily,
particularly with reference to the mat
ter of assessment for damages when
grade changes are made. The draft of
the amendment will be submitted to
the City Attorney for revision of its
legal phraseology, so that no technical
ity will interfere with the enforcement
of the amendment if adopted.
Police Commissioners Hutton and
Howell petitioned the Supervisors to
submit a charter amendment provid
ing for the appointment of Police
Judges by the Superior Judges, the
first appointment to be made in De
cember, 1905, and two others in Jan
uary, 1906, thus limiting the number
of Police Judges to three.
Police Commissioners Reagan and
Hutton filed a protest against the
amendment to fix the age limit of po
licemen at from 25 years to 35 years.
They ask that the age limit be fixed
between 21 and 30 years. They claim
that the ages of most policemen who
ccme up on trial for showing bad
judgment and the commission of of
fenses is above the 30-year limit.
The Election Commissioners yester
day petitioned the Board of Super
visors to submit an amendment to the
charter providing that a member of
the Election Commission, Registrar or
deputy registrar shall be eligible to
any other municipal office after the
expiration of the term for which he
was appointed. The amendment would
eliminate the phrase which prohibits
such officials from being eligible to
other offices within one year after the
expiration of their terms.
Fifteen deputy registrars employed
in the office of the Election Commis
sioners yesterday filed a petition with
the Board of Supervisors that a char
ter amendment be submitted to the
electors providing for an increase in
their salaries from $100 to $125 per
month.

Mrs. Kate Link declared she did not
endeavor to . decapitate her husband,
Frederick, with the household ax until
he hurled a teacup at her head, and
that if she had not feared that he might
cast a heavier missile with more ac
curate aim at the same target she cer
tainly would not have wielded the
hatchet as she did. Mr. Link, on the
other hand, testified that his 'Kate's
temper was more than a mortal; saint
could endure, and that when he threw
the teacup he did not try to hit or in
jure her head, but merely attempted to
Intimidate her into belief that he was In
desperate mood, ergo an unsafe person
to "nag."
Residents of the 600 block of Howard
streetâ the Links' occupy 630â said, how
ever, that, the peace of the -vicinage
would be vastly Improved - if . both Kate
and;Frederick were placed under police
restraint, as it was their wont to drink
to,excess and while inebriated .to fight
in a way that not only threatened to
terminate in the Â¦ murder, of one by the
I Miss Collins' protestation of Innocence
; was unnecessary, however, as Mr.,Snow
! informed the court that after filing his
. complaint against the woman he found
In one of his vest pockets the double
eagle he had accused her of stealing.
He was passing the door of her dwell
ing in Plnckney alley, he si&VÂ£d/ when
she accosted him and he stopped' to
speak to her. While conversing she
suddenly snatched his purse, which he
then believed contained $45, and when
she returned It he counted the contents
and finding only $25 concluded that she
had abstracted a $20 gold piece. So he
had her arrested, and after she was
placed in Jail he found the $20 In a vest
pocket, where he then remembered hav
ing placed it before he met her.
"The woman Is discharged, of
course," said the Judge, "and you, sir,
must appear in this court Monday and
explain more fully and satisfactorily
your conduct in having her arrested."
Mr. Snow's face instantly became a
study in gloom. s Miss Collins grinned in
triumph until her countenance consist
ed of little else than mouth, her tooth
embellishment glinting like a helio
graph in active service.
"It's mah puppus," she confidentially
informed Clerk Jack Rice, "to hev dat
yah poah spec-men of white trash kim
pelled to pay damages foah mah false
incahceration." Â¦Â¦";-;
Never did nature bestow upon woman
a complexion more deeply sable or teeth
more intensely white than Miss Flora
Collins displayed as she stood before
Judge Conlan and indignantly denied
that she had stolen $20 from W. Snow
of 622 Post street. The striking effect
of her dental equipment was enhanced
by a first- water brilliant set In one of
the upper incisors, the gem flashing
and glittering as if It were a firefly.
And her apparel was on a par of opu
| lence with the diamond.
As contestants Mrs. Margaret Ad
ams, petite and business-like, and
Mrs. Georgie Bosworth, statuesque
and diffident, entered Judge Cabaniss/
j courtroom and as friends they left it
i Is it necessary to say that the concil
iation was effected by his Honor,
whose good offices are ever at the ser
vice of lltlgous femininity?
It was a search warrant case, Mrs.
Adams, who keeps a lodging-house at
29 Eddy street, having detained the
trunks of Mrs. Bosworth because that
woman refused to pay about $30 rent
al due for an apartment occupied by
herself and her mother. Incidentally
it was disclosed that neither Mrs. Bos
worth, then a bride-to-be, nor her
maternal relative had actually en
gaged the room, but occupied it In ac
cordance with the desire of the young
er woman's fiance, George E. Bos
worth, who lived in the same house
and to have his betrothed near
him while they were perfecting ar
rangements for the wedding, which
took place after $30 worth of occu
pancy had been consumed. It was for
non-payment of this sum that Mrs.
Adams seized Mrs. Bosworth's bag
gage.
After this explanation had been
made to the court there came the ad
ditional and even more startling one
that Mr. Boeworth turned out to be
what Mrs. Bosworth's mother termed
"a bad egg." About a month after his
marriage he suddenly and mysterious
ly disappeared and then his bride dis
covered that he had cruelly' deceived
her. Instead of the opulent mining
man he represented himself to be
when he won her maiden heart, he
was, she said, a professional obtainer
of money and chattels under false pre
tense. With a fictitious check he had
paid the clergyman who married him;
he % had borrowed and pawned his
bride's gold watch and chain; he had
swindled her mother out of consider
able money and he had left Mrs. Ad
ams to whistle for a month's rental of
her bridal suite.
With such light to guide him, his
Honor advised Mrs. Adams to restore
Mrs. Bosworth's trunks. "For," quoth
the court to Mrs. Adams, "you can
better afford to stand tha loss" of $30
than can Mrs. Bosworth to be de
prived of her spare wardrobe. Be
sides, the man who betrayed her con
fidence also betrayed yours, Mrs. Ad
ams, and I see no reason why you two
should not put your heads together
and resolve to have vengeance on the
heartless fellow who deceived both of
you."
The ladles then retired to the cor
ridor and went Into executive session
and when they re-entered the court
room their relationship was that of
sisters In a common cause. Mrs. Ad
ams swore to a complaint accusing
Mr. Bosworth of defrauding an inn
keeper, Mrs. Bosworth declared her
intention of prosecuting him for any
offense the Judge might specify, and
Mrs. Bosworth's mother announced
that she was ready to invest her last
penny in having him pursued to the
ends of the earth and brought back
to face his victims.
The police, it may*be added, believe
the proverbial needle in the haystack
would be less difficult to find than
Mr. Bosworth, who has had ample
time to get far away from California
and bury his Identity.
other, but also set a bad example to the
younger married people in the j neigh
borhood, of whom there are many.
Disturbing the peace was the charge
against the Links before Judge Fritz,
and his Honor informed them that they
must either give assurance of imme
diate self-reform or go to Jail. Mrs. Link
responded by off eringto solemnly abjure
the touching, tasting or handling of in
toxicating liquors for any period the
court might see fit to suggest, provided,
of course, that "the old man," meaning
her husband, accompanied her in the
policy of renunciation. Mr. Link, who
is a boatman by profession, chimed In
with alacrity that he was ready to
swear off at any moment and for any
number of weeks, months or years.
"All right," said the Judge. "The case
is continued for ten days to give you
time and opportunity to make good
your promise to take a temperance
pledge and stick to it. By the way. it
wouldn't be a bad idea to have the
pledge with you when you come back
here." \
"We'll get It to-day," chorused Kate
and Fred, as they gratefully withdrew
from the court.
Then appeared before his Honor
Judge Fritz one Charles Meyers with a
request that Mike Barry, serving thirty
days' imprisonment for disturbing the
peace, be permitted to attend the
funeral of his father, who died yester
day morning.
"Mike has ten days more to serve,"
said Mr. Meyers, "and I, as the man
who had him arrested, ask that you let
him out of Jail long enough to see his
father buried. The boy has had a bad
time of It, for hls'mother died last Sun
day and now his father has followed
her."
The Judge gave the applicant a letter
to the Sheriff requesting the prisoner's
temporary release.
Barry Is a brother-in-law of Meyers,
who had him arrested for creating a
disturbance in the family dwelling, at
Sixth and Clara streets.

In the complaint it is alleged that the
defendants have willfully, maliciously
and falsely circulated reports in the
business communities of this city and
California to the effect that the plain
tiffs- were irresponsible, insolvent and
unworthy of credit. It is said that
the customers of Clark & Bro. have

fendants have sought to compel the
banks to refuse credit to their rivals.

pleased with the surroundings and
with the arrangements of their camp

the Federal officers received them and
the commander of each State organi-
Jaition had a special officer by order
of General MacArthur appointed to
act as his escort to the camp and
tb,ere give him any assistance he
might req-ire in settling the arrange

Under the skillful management of
Cclontl William 45. Patten, chief quar
termaster, and Captain G. McK. Wil
liamson, assistant to the chief quar
termaster, the detraining cf this bis
mass cf troops was most successfully
accomplished. In fact the speediness
â¢with which the troops were handled,
and wtth their big amount of baggage
larded on the camp grounds, was on
al! sides, by Federal aa.d State oScers,
nest highly commented upon.
There were but three accidents in .all

however, was undaunted and rode into

and enjoyed by all of the militia who
could absent themselves frcni duty.
Next to tbe arrival of the militia
to-day the main excitement was the
smashing up of a whole wagon load of
liquors by orders of General Mac-
Arthur. It appears that early this
afternoon, soon after the rsllitia ar
rived, a man secretly got into camp
with a lot of whisky and was in tbe
act of selling it to the troops when the
tLTTiir was reported to General Mac-
Arthur. who immediately sent a guard
to the wagon and taking out all the
bottles smashed them. The whole af

"When the China reached this port the
lovelorn double quartet had everything
arranged. "When the time came to land
the damsels quietly told Wong Jim,
leader of tbe flock, that matrimony
looked better to them than the exposi
tion. While Wong Jim in his rage bit
chunks out of his queue, the remainder
cf the Chinese crew chanted their ver
sion cf "Tell me, pretty maiden, are
there any more at home^ like you?"
Six cars, double-locked, guarded by
United States Inspectors and filled with
1S4 Chinese bound for the St. Louis
Fair, were attached to the overland
train that pulled out at 6:30 o'clock last
night. Tagged and numbered, the sons
of Han marched one by one from the
tug to their temporary prison. It was
evident from their appearance that the
men were of the farming class. Accom
panying the crowd were only eight of
the original number of twelve women.
The remaining four are in the Presby
terian Mission Home, where they will
await deportation to Hongkong. There
they will be married to the four pig
tailed mariners.
The Chinese in whose charge the
crowd has been during the time of
transportation to St. Louis are Wong
Jim, Da Silva and Leung Kwa. Many
local Chinese were on hand to say
good-by to their relatives who were
among the number imported to work

The Judge said he was more con
cerned about the child than the dig
nity of the court He issued an at
tachment against Hyman. The case
was continued for three weeks and if
the child Is found In the meantima
she Is to be given into the custody ef
Mrs. Freitas, pending Judge Dunne's
final decision.
"Sensational statements were made I
in Judge Dunne's court yesterday re
garding the disappearance of "Wini
fred Le Febvre, a pretty girl 7 years
of age. It was alleged that David
Hyman, a Jeweler at 1059 Market
street, who lived at 945 Post street,
had left the jurisdiction of the court,
taking . the child with him. It was
also alleged that Mrs. F. Ramon of
Berkeley, Hyman's mother-in-law, had
made a proposition to Mrs. Grace E.
Freitas, the child's mother, that for
the payment of $3000 the contest for
the possession of the child would be
dropped.
Mrs. Freitas Is now the wife of a
Stockton druggist. Her daughter was
born at Clipper Gap, â¢ Placer County,
in February, 1S97. The woman al
leges that her mother, without her
consent, gave the the child to the Rev.
J. W. Daniels, assistant superintend
ent of the Children's Home Finding
Society of Oakland. The child was
formally adopted by Hyman in Octo
ber of that year and was named Fern
Beatrice Hyman.
Hyman and his wife became de
votedly attached to the child- Mrs.
Hyman died. He again married, but
his second wife, Â»t Is alleged, had no
love for the child. Meanwhile Mrs.
Freitas had unsuccessfully searched
for her daughter and it was not until
last April that she traced her to the
Hyman home. A demand for the re
turn of the girl was made upon Hy
man by. Mrs. Freitas, but Hyman re
fused to give up possession. An ap
plication for a writ of habeas corpus
was made by Mrs. Freitas before
Judge Dunne and a hearing was had
before the Judge on May 24.
The Judge was to haye rendered his
decision a v.-eek ago yesterday, but
Hyman was not in court with the girl.
Attorney Lindsay, who represented
hinvJMiid that Hyman had left the
' jurisdiction of the court. He asked
for a continuance for a week and
promised to have Hyman and the
child in court at thattime. He had to
admit yesterday that he could find no
trace of Hyman or the little girl.
Attorney Charles Light of Stockton,
; who represents Mrs. Freitas, produced
a letter written by Mrs. Ramo.n to Mrs.
Freitas In the latter part of July, ask
ing to see her about "the little one."
Mrs. Freidas called with a friend, but
Mrs. Ramon refused to talk before the
| friend and Mrs. Freitas went into an
I adjoining room with Mrs. Ramon. It
j was then that Mrs. Ramon, it is al
leged, offered to give up the child on
payment of $3000. She said she was
making the offer without Hyman's
knowledge and that Judge Dunne had
said he would award the custody of
the child to Hyman. The offer was
refused. Attorney Light also declared
that Edward Meyer, a friend of Hy
man, had told him Hyman was at one
time wealthy and had spent consider
able money on the. child. Now he
needed money and a little would go a
long way and do a great deal of good.
Meyer had been informed that the
! child was not to be bartered like a
j bale of goods.

GLADE HOLDS BOSTON DOWN TO FIVE HITS
WHILE CLEVELAND LANDS HARD ON PLANK
TACOMA, Aug. 13.â By listless play
ing in the early innings Tacoma gave
the game to-day to the visitors. After
finding themselves behind the cham
pions tried to catch up, but were un
able, Iberg being effective. St. Vrain
also did some good work in tight
pinches. Singles by Beck and Castro
and Sheehan's error, giving Thlelman
a life, in the second, were followed- by
Steelman's hit, bringing in three.
Thielman scored in the fourth on a
pass, a sacrifice hit and Steelman's
single. In the fifth Beck got a safe
one, advanced en Castro's pass and
scored on Nadeau's hit. Spencer's dou
ble and Drennan's single gave the vis
itors their last run.
Iberg held Tacoma safe until the
fourth, when Sheehan singled and Nor
dyke was hit, the former scoring on in
iield outs. McLaughlin doubled in the
fifth, advanced on an out and scored
on Hurley's error. Casey drew a pass
in the seventh, took third on McLaugh
lin's safe one, scoring on an out. Lynch
singled in the eighth, advanced on
Casey's pass and was brought home by
McLaughlin's third hit. Tacoma should
have scored in the second, but the
chance was cut off by slovenly . base
running. Score:

This seemed to take the heart out of
San Francisco. Whalen hit Frisk with
the ball, and he easily stole second on
Gorton. Blankenshlp unloaded a single
to deep center and Frisk sped to the
plate. Blakenship was thrown out
while trying to do down on the first ball
pitched to Smith.
The home team never could approach
the plate while Hall was pitching. This
kid had all the veterans and others on
his staff in every inning, and the best
they got was two little hits. His per
formance was a remarkable one, for he
never once got into a hole nor did he
ever lose his speed or control. Score:

Not a run had marred the score when
Rip Van Haltren opened up the eighth
with a smashing two-base drive to the
score board. Mohler laid down a bunt
and Van landed on third. Then Dele
hanty popped up a fly to short right
field. Meany nailed the ball and made
an absolutely perfect return to Leahy.
On came Van Haltren, tearing as
though his life depended upon this final
effort. The ball apparently reached the
catcher's mitt just a fraction of a sec
ond ere the runner arrived. The umpire
motioned out, and changed it to safe In
a twinkling. Then followed the rough
house, which, fortunately, ended before
the free-for-all flght period came.
Every one was shouting for the um
pire's life at Recreation Park yesterday
when Van Haltren arrived at the pan
with the ball in the eighth inning and
settled a mighty battle. It was one of
the clostest kind of plays, and the run
ner looked like a dead one. Jack O'Con
nell was" on the spot and at first mo
tioned "out," but then changed it and
called the man "safe," Score^ â Seattle
2, San Francisco 0. 'i '. : v
There was a terrible uproar at all
events, and it ended only when Leahy
was put out of the game for making a
pass at O'Connell. Whalen also tried
to butt in on a fight, but Knell pulled
him ; away. The game was delayed
about fifteen minutes during the siege
that ensued.

SARATOGA. N. Y., Aug. 13.â The
Hopeful stakes was the principal racing
event to-day, largely because of its
bearing on the Futurity, to be run two
:weeks hence. Eleven colts and fillies
composed the field. Rose of Dawn was
number one at the start, and when the
barrier was released she suffered from
crowding and fell back for a hundred
yards, while Tanya, with which the
stable had declared to win, broke fast
from outside and went on after Heart's
Desire, this pair leading all others to
the stretch turn.
Meantime Rose of Dawn had shown a
remarkable flight cf speed from her
poor beginning and now made one of
the three leaders. As a matter of fact,
the Duryea colts were first, second and
third all the way around the turn. They
took dose order at the head of the
stretch, where Heart's Desire began to
show signs of distress, and Tanya and
Rose of Dawn were first and second.
At the end of five and a half furlongs
It. seemed Rose of Dawn could run up
to Tanya, but it was not so palpable
she could do so at the end of six fur
longs. Tanya passed the Judges a
length and a half in advance of her
stable companion. Rose of Dawn, be
hind which some distance off were
three youngsters fighting it out desper
ately. Up to the last few strides Heart's
Desire seemed likely to be third, but
with Hot Shot coming strongly from
the rear, he got up in time to earn
third money. Summary:

CHICAGO. Aug. 13. â In a down
pour of rain Phil Finch won the Oak
Park handicap, the feature of the
closing day of the summer meeting
at Harlem. Prince Silverwings was
second, a head in front of the added
starter. Schoolmate. The stake was
worth 52045 to the winner and nine
horses started. Phil Finch, which, it
is said, does not like a Â¦ slow track,
opened favorite at 7 to 2. When rain
began to fall he drifted to 5 to 1.
"Lucky" Baldwin's Felipe Lugo re
ceived the bulk of the play, being
backed from 6 to 1 to 4 to 1. He was
a close second choice to Dalvay, post
favorite at 19 to 5. Felipe Lugo was
a wild horse for a mile. He kept the
lead, closely pressed by Prince Sil
verwings, but faltered turning for
home, where Phil Finch,, coming up
with a rush, got in front and stayed
there to the wire, winning by a length
and a half. Schoolmate, outrun the
first part, closed with a sensational
rush and only lost the place by a nar
row margin.
Ed Corrigan's fast imported colt
McGee, the favorite, was badly beaten
in the fourth race owing to the mud.
It was a mile dash "and Bragg won
handily, with Ahola second and Huz
zah, which was left at the post, third.
It was a bad day for racing. Before
the first race was run it was clear and
warm. Suddenly a rain storm blew
up and between the running of the
third and fourth races rain fell in
torrents, making the track sloppy.

CROWE AND DUXCAX TAKE
FINAL. TOURNAMENT SIATCH
Most of the Scottish bowlers have
returned to town and the green at
Golden Gate Park was crowded yes
terday afternoon. Four tournament
matches were played, three In singles
and one in doubles. After many weeks
of play the doubles tournament was
brought to a conclusion. There was
quite a demonstration when M. L.
Crowe and J. M. Duncan won the
match and tournament. They beat
W. R. Eaton and Dr. Hamilton, 21 to
17. The victory of Crowe and Dun
can was somewhat of a surprise to
many. Crowe, who won the first
championship of the city in singles,
bowled splendidly, as did his partner.
The match was extremely close from
start to finish. On the eighteenth and
last end Hamilton laid his bowl along
side the jack, but Duncan with a
well-aimed shot dislodged the bowl
and won the end.
In the singles tourney J. Stott beat
W. A. Cook rather easily, the score
being 21 to 7. M. L. CroWe caused
quite a surprise by taking H. L.. Tlck
ner into camp. Crowe was in great
form and won by a 21 to 15 score.
James Gray beat James Mearns, 21 to
12. Many practice matches were
played and resulted as follows:
S. Irvlngr beat J. M. Forsyth, 21 to
14; J. Mearns and Forsyth beat T. Mc-

VALL.EJO, Aug. 13.â The meeting of
the California harness circuit closed
this evening. The track record was
lowered to 2:09% and the general ver
dict was that the racing throughout
the four days was well contested.
A large crowd attended to-day and
the betting was good. The first stake
event was for trotters in the 2:30 class.
A. field of four horses started. Jupiter
B opened a 2 to 3 favorite. He took the
lead at the start, but at the half-mile
pole broke badly. Morosco won the
heat handily. Morosco captured the
next two heats after a hard drive.^
The feature of the day was the'sec
ond race, the Electric Railroad stakes,
worth 5600, for pacers of the 2:10 class.
A field of six horses started. Cuckoo
opened favorite at 3 to 2. The first
heat was- won by Highball. He passed
Zoleck'near the wire. Time, 2:09%â a
new record for the track. In the sec
ond heat Zolock turned the tables,
beating Highball. Time 2:03%. In the
third heat Zolock opened favorite at
odds of 1 to 4. Highball led off at the
quarter pole, with Zolock close up, the
two horses pacing neck and neck
around the track. Highball won the
heat. In the fourth heat Highball took
the lead, with Dictatress at his sulky
wheel, Zolock lying back. Zolock
made a grand struggle up the home
stretch, just nosing out Highball at the
wire. At the opening of the fifth heat
Dictatress took the lead, but this was
soon overcome by Zolock, Highball ly
ing- back. These positions remained un
changed till the three-quarter pole was
reached, when Zolock broke. Highball
won the heat and the race. Summary:

I Jeremiah Lynch, Fresh From His Fis
tic Encounter Aboard Liner
i - Deutschlnnd, Home.
Jeremiah. Lynch, well known club
man, miner and writer, who has been
i abroad for several months, has re-
I turned to this city. He signalized the
I fact last evening by giving a dinner at
the St. Francis Hotel. He has not yet
made his appearance at the Bohemian â¢
j Club, his usual haunt, but friends at- ;
i tribute this dereliction to his recent ex- j
| citing experience aboard the German !
| liner Deutschland on the eve of Its ar- i
rival in New York, when he was re- j
ported by wire as the victor in a fistic j
encounter with a prominent Spanish-
American.
According to the telegraphic reports
a young and beautiful Parisian, Mar- j
guerlte Fourchen, In whose welfare j
Lynch is supposed to have become in
terested, Involved hjm In a quarrel
with the South American, who proved
an easy mark for the Californian's '
right arm blows and was promptly I
felled to the vessel's deck. As a result j
of this Incident the young French j
! woman was detained on Ellis Island
| and sent back to Europe on the same j
steamship that had brought her west- |
ward. Lynch's friends assert that .the i
notoriety thus gained has aroused his ;
i diffidence and that he will remain away I
{ from his. club until his presence in the '
j city has become generally known and .
I gossip over the New York harbor
i scene has worn itself out.

Mrs. Jeffries has not been well for
the last few days and this seems to
worry the big fellow. He spends much
of his time with her, "attending to her
every want and "doing hÂ«

presses himself as.belng perfectly'sat
isfled with the form the big fellow has
shown.
Â¦ During the afternoon he lolled around
the hotel, swapping stories with Colo- '
nel Martin Brady, Eddie Hanlon, Dick '
Adams and other notable lights of the
sporting world who are at present at ;
the .Springs. After supper he again j
went into the gym and spent another
busy hour with the various apparatus. :
He has not done much boxing up to !
the present time, but will commence
to-morrow and his sparring partners ;
are getting ready fdr the big stunt. He
appears in perfect condition, though his
wind needs a little more tuning up, and I
he can also afford to take off a few =
pounds of superfluous flesh. There are
hints In the air that Jeff will weigh
fully 245 pounds when he enters the [
ring with Munroe. ' i
HARBIN SPRINGS. Aug. . 13.â The !
champion arrived at the Springs late !
last night after one of the hardest j
day's hunting he ever experienced. For j
more than twenty hours Jeff tramped i
and trudged through the wilds of the
Lake County Mountains without tast- j
ing a morsel of food. When he arrived ;
at the hotel he was tired, but the way j
he went to the big feed was a sight for
any weakling to behold.
- The big fellow brought back two
deer and about twenty doves. He was 1
so engrossed in the work of chasing the i
anflered beauties over the hills that he I
forgot all about eating. After he had ;
brought the two big bucks to the J
ground and filled his bag with the j
smaller game Jeff began to realize It j
was a long time between meals in the !
hills, so he turned his steps homeward, j
bringing with him a special appetite. j
The first place he made for was the !
pantry. Down into the refrigerator he ;
dug and brought out a couple of big
steaks, a handful of choice chops and '
some other things that looked good, j
The cook was told to get busy, and in !
half an hour the champ was punishing !
the good things for a fare-ye-well. j
He went to bed early, after satisfying '
his appetite, and arose In the morning â¢
looking fine and dandy. Before break- j
fast he did a ten-mile run and then felt i
like putting another big meal under his 1
belt. "When this task was complete the
big fellow took to the gym for an hour
or so and practiced on the various ma- ;
chines.

from plunging. . - Most of the bears' put out
only small â¢ short lines and. then rushed- to
cover at the first i Intimation of an upturn in
prices. Such an upturn occurred when buying
orders from outsiders came in. Minneapolis,
which at first was inclined to minimize the
late crop damage â¢ reports, sent Â¦ In alarming
messages and announced prices there stronger.
The Southwest, too. appeared to become sud
denly mistrustful -of conditions.- Both sections
*.>nt buying orders and the local crowd changed
front. Prices responded with a general ad
vance, September â¢ touching $1 02%. The
strength was only . short lived, however. Tbe

The fruit market was badly congested,
stocks of nearly all descriptions being exces
sive, and. although trade was active, both
locally and for shipping account, there was a
heavy surplus unsold at the clo*e. The best
lots of Peaches, Pears and Apples In wrappers
were in good request for shipping and brought
steady prices, but there was an abundance of
low-grade offerings of those and other fruits to
be had at eaey rates. All. of the canneries
were running to full capacity on Bartlett
Pears, but they werÂ« heavily supplied with
contract stock and purchased but- a compara
tively email quantity In the open market.
Pluma and Prunes rultd very weak, except, for
a few varieties, which were wanted for export
and they commanded a small premium. Plums
In bulk were steadily accumulating ' owing to
tho lack of demand for canning purposes. Figs
were in ample supply' and sold at wide rangÂ«
as to size of package and quality. Canta
loupes and Nutmeg Melons were a glut on
the market and the top rates were obtained
only in a peddling way for small parcels.
Watermelons, too, wt re easier under excessive
supplies. Grapes were plentiful and of poor
quality generally. Th* best lots of Black and
Muscat sold for shipping at OoftSOc per crate
while. Tokay touched $1. Small boxes of all
varieties were weak at 50@60c. Berries cleaned
up pretty well and occasional sales of Rasp
berries and large Strawberries were reported
at a slight advance over the top quotations.
Citrus and -Tropical fruits : were plentiful and
generally dull.

bullish tone to the market observable several

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Potatoes ruled weak, at sharply reduced
prlce3 and the market was badly congest- d
with low-erade river Burbanks. which have
been accumulating for several days. Ship
rnents to the Southwest have about ceased and
local dealers are of the opinion that the mar- |
Keta In that region are being supplied from '
points in thÂ« middle West, which have the Â¦
advantage of lower freight rates. Sweet Po- ;
tatoes from Merced and Stockton were selling \
at 3Â©3%c per pound while river lots sold
slowly at 2Â©2Â»4c. Onions were in compara- I
tlvelv light supply and prices were main- I
talned with a moderate drgree of firmness. !
Miscellaneous vegetablrs were- generally I
weak, with .supplies of all descriptions far In
excess cf the demand Strictly fancy Toma
toes were fairly nrm. but the receipts Included j
much rioor stock, which dragged at unsteady ;
rates. The other vegetables moved freely under
the usual extra demand for Sunday wants,
but there was a heavy surplus of all kinds
still unsold at the close. . ;

When the Coroner asked Dr. Ardenyi
what was the meaning of hypertrophy
of the heart, he replied that it was an
accumulation of blood in the heart. He
said after the adjournment of the In
quest that the question was a "catch"
one and that If the Coroner had given
him notice beforehand he would have
"read up" on the subject of hypertro
phy. He admitted that he and Dr.
Bluhm had performed two curetting
operations on the woman, the first
about two weeks ago and the second
on last Thursday, the day of Mrs.
Cohn's death. Dr. Moyer assisted at
the second, operation.
-Detective Edward Gibson, who has
charge of the police end of the case,
was present at the inquest, which was
continued until Monday morning at 10
o'clock.
Both Ardenyi and Bluhm denied any
crimlnal intent, and Insisted that the
operation waa necessary and lawful.

Mrs. Sarah Cohn was the wife of
Abraham Cohn, whose residence and
place of business" Is at 728 Howard
street. She was a strong, healthy
woman, only 26 years old, and died after
the second of two surgical operations
by Dr. Ardenyi and Dr. George L
Bluhm. The body would have been
buried without Investigation but for
some neighbors, who told the Coroner
there was something wrong. Morgue
Surgeon L. D. Bacigalupl found that
death had been caused by a criminal
operation "performed in a very bung
ling manner." Coroner Leland also pro
nounced the death of the woman the
result of Ignorance, carelessness and
inoompetency. '.Â¦--- :
Dr. Joseph Ardenyl confessed under
oath yesterday at the inquest into the
death of Mrs. Sarah Cohn that he had
deliberately made a false statement in
the certificate when he wrote that the
cause of her death was cardiac failure
and hypertrophy of the heart. When
Coroner Leland asked him why he had
done so the physician replied he had
issued the false certificate for the pur
pose of shielding his friend, young Dr.
Moyer of Mayfleld, whom he had called
in to assist him in the surgical opera
tion. Jn other words, he added, he did
not want Dr. Moyer to get into any
trouble about the woman's death-
Ardenyi swore that he was a gradu
ate in medicine of the University of
Tennessee.

The resorts show, but little shrinkage
in popularity. Most of the leading ho
tels are now running bank full, with

OAKLAND, Aug. 13. â Everybody
seems to be back In town again, and
such a happy looking crowd it is that
throngs the shop3 and thoroughfares.
Of course, there is a lot of shopping to
do, and the women are correspondingly
happy. What woman doesn't just love
to shoi>? The menâ bless their hearts!
âhave been so lonesome all summer
(of course they have), while their fami
lies have been away, that they gladly
"pungle" for all necessary shopping;
so everybody is pleased and we haven't
begun to realize yet that our poor old
noses are again at the grindstone of
e\ery-day life. For many, however,
the smart set in particular, the every
day grind is a merry one, and not until
patrician wives are worn to the quick
by a winter's madding whirl do they
heed the wearing effects of the social
mill.
But Just now tired nerves have been
rested and society's fair devotees are
ready for whatever of joy and pleasure
the seson may bring.
It is good, too, to see familiar faces
again, and many a pleasant little meet-
Ing takes place these days in the shops
and on the streets. Among the many
who have been away all summer and
are home again is Mrs. Fred Stolp,
looking as pretty and charming as
ever. Mrs. Charles Minor Goodall is
also back from Catalina, where she has
been spending a few delightful weeks.
The Horry Meeks were also at Cata
lina and returned last week.
Mrs. Charles Lovell spent the sum
mer at McCray's and has . returned

and Phyllis Lovell became expert

Mrs. W. W. Crane and little Jean are

was very popular.
The Q. A. Chases are still In the East,
but Miss Helen Chase is at home en
tertaining a few Eastern friends, Mrs.
Scovllle and her daughters. Misses
Helen and Mamie Scovllle.
Mrs. John J. Valentine Sr. is home
from the East. Miss Ethel Valentine
is still enioying a visit in the Santa
Cruz Mountains with Miss Fore.
Mrs. Paul Lohse's health has not
been good this summer and a few days
ago she went to Loa Gatos for an ln
definte stay, accompanied by her
daughter, Mrs. McClure.
Mrs. George W. Fisher, who has been
spending the greater part of the sum
mer in Mill Valley, is home again.
A pretty little wedding took place out
on Thirty-seventh street Wednesday
evening, at the residence of Mrs. E. H.
Noffsinger, when her daughter. MisÂ»
Virginia E. Noffsinger, became the
bride of Robert K. Wilson, a well-to
do business man of Los Angeles. In
addition to the relatives Just a few in
timate friends were present. The offi
ciating clergyman was Rev. Mr. Ry
land of Los Angeles, a warm personal
friend of the groom, who came up from
the southern city to tie the . nuptial
knot. Mr. Wilson " was also accom
panied by another friend, Mr. Parsells,
of Los Angeles. A brother of the bride,
Ernest Noffsinger, was best- man, and
Miss May Leiter was maid of honor.

Leaves All to Children.
Neither the horse nor the buggy
was seriously damaged and when with
the help of some people in the neigh
borhood they were put on the road
again. Dr. Ritter was taken back to
San Jose for treatment- She suffered
intense pain during the long trip, but
did not complain. Upon arriving at
the home of relatives the broken
bones were set by local physicians.
Dr. Ritter Is now resting comfortably,
with no sign of internal complications
to prevent her recovery. She is so se
riously hurt, however, that she will be
unable to return to her lecture room
during the first half of the college
year.
In falling Dr. Ritter was thrown so
heavily against the* rocks in the creek
bod that her collar bone and ribs were
broken. The buggy fell upon her, too,
and kept her pinioned until Professor
Ritter went to her rescue.
The bumping of the shafts against
the animal only frightened it the
more, however, and suddenly jumping
to one side in its frenzy It turned the
buggy over an embankment into a
creek below. â¢
The accident of which Dr. Ritter is
the victim occurred yesterday while
she was driving in her carriage in
company with her husband. Professor
William -E. Ritter. professor of zo
olojry at the university. They were on
their way to the New Almaden quick
silver mines at the time, intending to
visit and inspect them.
While returning from the mines the
horse attached to their buggy became
unmanageable through a disarrange
ment of the harness. As they were
driving down hill at the time and had
no brake, Professor Ritter thought it
prudent to get out and hold the bug
gy back until the bottom of the can
yon was reached, leaving his wife to
drive the horse slowly.
Dr. Mary B. Ritter, lecturer on hy
giene at the University of California,
chairman of the committee on clubs
for women students and an active
worker in all university affairs, is ly
ing seriously hurt at the home of rela
ti%*es in San Jose as the result of a
runaway accident in the Santa Cruz
Mountains, near New Almaden. She
is suffering from a broken collar bone
and two broken ribs and it will be
months before she will be able to re
sume her work at the university. Her
condition is such that she cannot be
removed to her home in Berkeley.

TACOMA, Aug. 13.â When the schoon
er Americana sailed from Port Town
send on May 9 for Osaka she carried
away as sailors three shanghaied log
gers, and one of them, James Mc-
Dougall, returned to-day on the steam
ship Lyrla. On May 8 he went to Port
Townsend with J94 savings, of which
he spent $8. Then he drank something
In a saloon, and when he awakened he
was on the deck of the Americana and
penniless.
Fifty-eight days on the ocean made
him and his three lubber companions
thoroughly homesick. The officers and
experienced seamen abused them. The
captain tied them to a mast during a
storm. McDougall says fighting and
beating was their lot all the way over.
On the Fourth of July a big fight oc
curred, and half of the crew was laid
out for a day. One of the loggers was
drugged at Port Townsend and nearly
died. His companions went to Manila,
but McDougall turned back at Shang
hai, going to Kobe and there taking
passage on the Lyria, There he was ac
companied by the Amerlcana's second
officer, who was also disgusted with the
conditions aboard her.
The country's locomotives number

OAKLAND, Aug. 13.â Surviving her
husband by only a few weeks, Mrs.
Mary Theresa Spaulding, widow of
former Mayor N. W. Spaulding, died
at her home at 666 Twenty-fifth street
this morning, surrounded by her fam
ily. Since the death of her husband,
who died while on a trip East', Mrs.
Spaulding failed rapidly. She was 66
years of age, and a native of Kentucky.
She will be burled Monday at 2 p. m.
from the First Unitarian Church.
The Spauldings resided in this city
for the last forty years and were close
ly identified with its growth and ad
vancement. Last Tuesday Mrs. Spauld
ing was stricken and it Is believed her
death was due to heart disease. An
autopsy will be held.
At the inquest Dr. Watson refused to
testify and was fined $15 for contempt
cf court.
The funeral of Mrs. Watson was held
two days later. No inquest was held.
Mrs. Watson's life was insured for
$3u,000. On the day after the funeral
Dr. Watson left Xew London.
Mrs. Watson, who was 40 years old,'
was the daughter of Dr. J. J. Suter, a
prominent resident of Palmyra. Suter
demanded that the authorities make an
investigation of his daughter's death.
The result was the exhuming of Mrs.
Watson's body and the impaneling of a
Coroner's jury on July 28. Drs. Briggs,
Kinder and Hlldreth. together with
physicians from New London, Hannibal
and Palmyra, began an autopsy.
Dr. Watson was lying on the bridge,
unconscious. The body of Mrs. Watson
was found in the river. Her face was
partly under water.
Dr. Watson became conscious the
next day. He said that while driving
their horse had become frightened at a
piece of paper on the bridge. The doc
tor said he was rendered unconscious
when thrown from the buggy, as a re
sult of the horse* shying. He did not
know what happened to his wife, he
said.
Almost equaling it as a startling de
nouement was the statement of Drs.
Briggs and Hlldreth that Mrs. Watson
did not die from drowning or, internal
injuries. The three physicians, have
been here since the Inquest began mak
ing an examination of Mrs. Watson's
body and an analysis of the stomach.
Mrs. Watson's death followed a car
riage ride which she took with her hus
band. Dr. Jones Watson of New London,
on July 5. They started out together
early in the evening from their home,
and did not return. Friends, becoming
alarmed, started a search for them.
They found the carriage empty at the
side of a river, near a small bridge not
far from New London.
NEW LONDON. Mo., Aug. 13.â Dr.
Lilly, who. with Drs. Hlldreth and
Briggs of St. Louis, has been making a
chemical analysis of the stomach of
Mrs. Jones Watson of New London,
testified this morning that he had found
traces of morphine in Mrs. Watson's
stomach. Dr. Lilly's testimony caused
a great sensation.

Th<4 strong opposition to the com
pulsory vaccination law which has
been shown since the opening of the
present school term has induced the
Board of Health to authorize Health
Officer von Adelung to prepare a
series of papers on vaccination for
general publication in the local press.
The papers will be examined by the
board and if approved will be pub
lished with its indorsement.
It is expected that these papers,
which will explain the benefit of vac
cination and its necessity, will tend to
remove the prejudice against the pres
ent State law. Dr. von Adelung said
at the meeting of the Board of Health
last night that he would undertake to
present the matter of vaccination from
a medical standpoint, but that he
would not make any attempt to dis
cuss the legal or moral phases of the
question.
Senator F. W. Leavitt is not In favor
of the present law and he says he will
take the matter up at the next meet
ing of the Legislature. Senator
Leavitt said to-day: "I believe that
the act requiring that all public school
children be vaccinated is wrong and
at the next session of the Legislature
I shall present a bill for the repeal of
this compulsory vaccination law."
Dr. Hubert N, Rowell, secretary of
the Berkeley Board of Health, made
the following statement regarding the
stand taken by that body: "The con
troversy regarding vaccination is per
ennial, and physicians of experience
have long since wearied of noticing
these temporary spasms of so-called
public opinion."
The opponents of the compulsory
vaccination law will hold a meeting
Monday evening in Hamilton Hall,
Thirteenth and Jefferson streets. Ad
dresses will be made by the Rev. J.
Stitt Wilson of Berkeley, Dr. W. Allen,
president of the Berkeley Board of
Education, and others.

CHICAGO, Aug. 13.â There were few
developments in the packers' strike to
day and it is not probable that there
will be any before Monday, when a
committee of retail dealers will call
upon Mayor Harrison and ask him to
act as mediator in the strike.
Chief of Police O'N'eiil and Police In
spector Hunt laid formal charges be
fore the Mayor to-day against Justice
John Fitzsrerald, who. It is asserted by
the police, has discharged the majority
erf the rioters brought before him no
matter how strong the evidence
against them misrht be.

will admit this, but persons familiar

In the West, skilled butchers, dressers
ezid h_tpÂ«rs are seeking employment as
ctrlke-bre&kers In the East. A carload
ef such men from Chicago is due here
to-morrow.
Enraged by what they regard as the
basest breach of faith and betrayal of
their fellow craftsmen, the New York
strikers and their sympathizers are
iTowing dally more sullen. Ever and
_x.cn, as they see big beef vans moving
off to make deliveries under heavy po
lice guard their spleen breaks all
bounds. Then follows one of the scenes
Â©f riotous disorder which are now of
almost hourly occurrence along First
fcvenue, In the packing-house district.
For the first time, to-day the crack
horsemen of the mounted police force
were called In as a factor in the pres
ent strike. All over the city New
Yorkers stared In surprise to see the
ratty riders of the Central Park squad,
familiar on well-kept drives and bridle
paths, cantering along in the wake of
huge loads of dressed beef or putting
epurs to their horses' flanks to repel
en &ss_u2t upon some grease-covered
negro driver.
NEW YORK, Aug. 13.â Gradually It
has dawned on the minds of the strik

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
The largest appropriation for good
roads was that made at the last session
of the New York Legislature. It was
a million and a half.
The Poland tunnel, 8071 feet long, be
tween the Agua Frla and Lynx Creek
valleys of Arizona, has been completed.
It Is for the purposes of private mining
development.
At eighty years of age there Is still a
vulnerable spot In the heart of Charles
Tinker, a man of wealth and retired
manufacturer. He Is to be married to
morrow to Mrs. Ada C. Bootes, a
widow, who Is thirty years Tinker's
junior.
The ceremony will take place at
the home of the bride at 2536 Ban
croft way. That Is all anybody
knows about It, though, because nei
ther of the principals will discuss the
affair, which will be rather quiet, with
only relatives for witnesses.
The groom used to be a manufac
turer in Ohio. When he retired from
business he came to Berkeley and was
one of the guests at Mrs. Bootes'
boarding-house. The association was
a pleasant one and led to a proposal of
marriage. Mrs. Bootes is 50 years old.
according to the marriage license is
sued to-day, and has a son and a
daughter.

PREACHERS ANNOUNCE TOPICS
FOR SUNDAY DISCOURSES
Each of x the two leading political
pcj-Ues will nominate ten Presidential
Klettors at its coming State Conven
tion at Santa. Cruz. The Republicans
may recognize Congressional districts
in the selections, yet every nominee on
the ticket will fce a candidate at large.
There is gossip that John F. Davis
Of Ami&dor and R. N. Bulla of Los An
geles will be nominated without refer
ence to district boundaries and one or
the other will probably head the
Uckct. Edward Sweeney of Shasta,
F. il. Smith of Alameda, Charles
Hammond of Lake, S. M. Shortridge
of San Francisco and J. O. Hayes of
tianta Clara may be placed on the
ticket." It seems to be settled that
.Senator Devlin of Sacramento will be
chosen for chairman of the conven
tion.
The Democratic State Convention
will meet at Santa Cruz, Monday. Au
grust 22, transact the business of the
session and probably adjourn before
the Republican delegates arrive in the
convention city. Popular interest in
the coming political events applies
chiefly to the Republican meeting, as
ibe Democrats are in such a hopeless
minority that politicians predict a
majority of 50,000 for Roosevelt in
California-
A determined effort will be made to
elect a solid Republican delegation to
represent California in Congress. The
only district that can be placed in the
doubtful column is the Fourth, which
lies wholly within the boundaries of
San Francisco. J. X. Gillette will
Etirely carry the First District by a
handsome majority. The able and
j.opular Duncan E. McKinlay of San
ta Rosa, whose long residence in the
district has made him familiar with
the voters of Sacramento, Sonoma,
Xapa, Mendocino, Glenn, Colusa,
Butte, Surter, Yuba, Yolo, Lake and
llarin, will receive the undivided sup
port of Republicans and also the eup
.port of very many Democratic mer
chants, farmers and workingmen. The
lolly of sending a Democrat to Wash
ington to represent the district has
been clearly demonstrated. Duncan
McKinlay in the House of Represent
atives would be able to accomplish
something of substantial benefit to the
great agricultural, mining, commer
cial and industrial Interests generally
of the Second District.
It is estimated that Roosevelt and
McKinlay will carry the district by
Â£000 majority. M. F. Cochrane of
Marin and Theodore Bell of Napa are
mentioned as aspirants for the Demo
cratic nomination.
In the Third District Joseph R.
Knowland. a man of high character
and splendid attainments, will head the
Republican ticket and be elected by an
overwhelming majority.
The Republicans are hopeful of suc
cess in the Fourth District. The con
vention to select a candidate will meet
jn this city on September 22.
The Fifth District is Republican and
there is an inclination in the party to
concede the nomination to Santa Clara
County. The convention will meet at
Santa Cruz on August 25 or 26. The
advisability of adjourning the conven
tion to San Jose will be discussed.
J: C. Needham will be re-elected in
the Sixth District. He has rendered ex
cellent and efficient service In Con
gress. The people of the district, irre
spective of party, know his worth.
The Seventh and Eighth districts are
safely Republican and the exciting con
tests" over the United States Eenator-
Fhip will largely increase the Repub
lican vote in the pouth.
. The Election Commissioners met yes
terday and declared the official result
of the return of votes cast in the re
cent primary elections. The total vote
cast was 18.141, of which the Republi
cans polled 9089, the Democrats 7339,
the Union Labor party 1439, the Social
ists 254 and the Prohibitionists 20.
The regular Republicans elected 211
delegates. The opposition elected six
teen delegates in the Thirty-fifth dis
trict, fourteen in. the Thirty-sixth and
in the Thirty-second elected Richard J.
Welch to the State Convention and
Robert Gordon to the local convention.
The Democratic delegates elected by
districts were:
Regular Democrats â Twenty-ninth,
12 delegates; Thirtieth, 13; Thirty-first,
12; Thirty-second, 11; Thirty-third, 8;
Thirty-fourth. 8%; Thirty-fifth, 9;

ty-fifth, S; total. 71%. -; .; .
In the Thirty-ninth District, Seven
ty-third Precinct, the election officers
failed to rpake returns of the vote cast,
thereby defeating H. H. Eichoff (Reg.
Dem.) and electing Livingston Jenks,
Thomas Judge, James Quigley and
Daniel Curran of the Democratic
League with a tie vote of 112, and giv
ing each one-fourth of a vote in the
local convention.
The regular Union Labor) party elect
ed 202 delegates and the opposition in
the Thirty-ninth District elected seven
delegates.
