KANSAS CITY. Mo.. April 25.âLes
lie Marcy, husband of the Mrs. Marty
who is to be a star witness in the
Beef Trust investigation, is employed
by the United States Water and Steam
Supply Company in this city. He says
that when his wife gathered the evi
dence which she is to present to the
Grant! Jury in Chicago to-morrow she
had in mind only a series of stories for
a socialist paper
"Mrs. Many went to work for the
Swifts long before the beef Investiga
tion was thought of," said Marcy.
"She was in the legal department,
which the employes call the 'Skin'
department, because of some of the
methods in use "there, she used to
come home and tell me about some of
the oeculiar letters she had written
and the things she had heard and seen,
until finally I suggested that she make
rotes for future use in her writings.
"Mrs. Marcy has a remarkable mem
ory. She was with the Swifts for eight
months ?.nd during that time she made
carboa^ct)pies-ofrsevertU -Tetters in the
legal department, which will be rather
embarrassing lor the packers when
they are used in court. She got a
record of prices and correspondence
thowing that there was something
more than a mere understanding be
tween the packers. She used to mar
vel at the way in which they treated
customers and at their success in keep
ing their methods under cover.
"Mrs, Marcy worked for the Armours
about six months, in the office of N. H.
Hand, the treasurer. She kept copies
uf many of his letters to men who had
credit with the company. All of these
papers we kept for more than two
years, thinking, as I have said, or
writing a story. We never told the
Government about what we knew.
"Mrs- Marcy wrote a series of
articles for the International .Socialist
Review, published In Chicago, and
probably they attracted the secret ser
vice men. At all events a detective
came here one day and summoned my
wife to go to Chicago. It is to be
expected that the packers will miinln
lze. as long as possible, what she has
in her possession, but the Government
Becret Service thought It sufficiently
important to take her to Chicago to
testify."
Mr. and Mrs. Marcy live at the Melba
Hotel, at 611 East Ninth street. Mrs.
Marcy is a "friendly visitor" for the
Associated Charities. She gave up her
position as stenographer for the Ar
mours, Marcy says, because of poor
health. Mrs. Marcy and her husband

Refugee Finn
Tells Story
of Outrages
WERNER SANDBERG. THE YOLNG
FINN WHO !S AN EXILE IX
SAN FRAN< IS
#
Werner Sandberg. a tall and ath
letic young student from Finland, has
sought refuge in San Francisco to es
cape the prim purpose of the Czar's
police to inu)!icate him in the assas
sination of Governor Bobrikoff. He
wandered aimlessly about fen many
months in Russia, hoping to avoid the
espionage, but wherever he went the
matching eyes of relentless sleuths
were on him. He has finally made his
way to this city to rest his ner\
It is surprising that he was allowed
to leave the Czar's domain and was not
arrested for alleged complicity in the
assassination of the late Governor of
Finland. He regards himself fortunate
in now being able to breathe freely,
though he protests utter innocence of
the charge it was sought to fasten on
him.
In speaking of his experiences Sand
berg had the following to say:
"Immediately 1 fter General Bobrikoff
was killed the town was declared un
der martial law and every one had to
be in bed at 9 o'clock.
'"The authorities instituted a diligent
search for those implicated and many
an innocent person was made to suffer.
At midnight they unceremoniously
kicked in the front doorg of homes,
pulled up the carpets, slashed open
the furniture coverings with their
swords end even cut the paper off the
walls in their eager search for incrim
inating evidence.
"The morning following the assassi
nation the police called at my home
and searched my room. Behind a bu
reau they found an anti-Russian
pamphlet and a letter from Schau
man. the assassin, the contents of
which were in no way related to the
tragedy.
" The result was that with fifteen
other students who had known Schau
man and dined with him every day,
I Â«Â« thrown into jaii. During the
first twenty-fcrur hours of our impris
onment we were given nothing to eat
or drink. A request for the latter was
met with a slap in the face.
Afier being incarcerated for three
day> and four nights we were liber
ated, but were kept under constant po
lice surveillance. We soon learned that
our freedom was for a short time only
and that we were soon to be rearrest
ed. At opportune times all of the six
teen students except one Ericson, left
Finland.
"Three of us finally emigrated to the
United States, while others went to
France. Sweden and Norway.
"Ericson was rearrested and sent to
Takoterlnoscloff, a Russian fortress
and political prison in the Ural moun
tains. A Finn knows too well w%at it
means to be . banished to that place,
as all hope is left behind.
"I am practically isolated from my
family, as all mail, especially to or
from the United States, is first In
spected by the authorities before it is
Â»red. That alone works a hard
ship on me, as I am unable to receive
financial assistance from that source.
I am a graduate pharmacist and feel
confident that I could more readily ob
tain employment were I not a stranger
in a strange land."

Scandal Involves Of

Alleged to Have Accepted
Fees While Minister

President Castro Is Said to Han a
Check Showing a $10,000
Payment
Special Cable to The Call and New Tor* Her

CARACAS. Venezuela. April 25.â i
"Either the American Minister to Ven
ezuela should be removed or the First
Assistant Secretary of State should be
asked to step out of his office in Wash
ington." was the startling statement
made by a dispassionate observer of
Venezuelan affairs in Caracas to-day.
This same idea has occurred to many
persons who have visited Caracas re
oentljr and who have remained there
long enough to obtain some inkling of
the diplomatic scandal centering
around the two officials desig
nated. This scandal racks the entire
community and is of such a nature
that, whether true or false, it seems
impossible that the two ufficials can
continue much longer in the same de
partment of the nvernment.
Briefly stated, the scandal, which is
public property in this capital,
involves the allegation that while act
ing as United States Minister to Ven
ezuela, present Assistant Secretary
of Stat" Loomis obtained considera
ble pecuniary benefits from the New
York and Bermuda Asphalt Company
and that a '.heck showing a payment
of $10,000 to him by the company is
now In th-> possession of President
Oasim. This. It is held by many per
sons, supplies the true explanation of
President Castro"? continuous defiance
of th<e United States in the asphalt
matter. It is said to have clogged the
free action of that government, which
is not anxious for the ventilation of an
administration scandal.
Other charges against Loomis are
that, while Minister, he purchased for
a trifling sum a claim for $4000 against
the Venezuelan Government and then
used his Influence as Minister to col
lect the full amouit.
Still another document is apparently
a draft of a contract entered into be
tween Lomis and one Meyer, under
which Loomis agreed to use his in
fluence to adjust heavy outstanding
obligations of Venezuelt to the
amount of $10,000,000. for a considera
tion of one-seventh of that sum, or,
nominally. $1,400,000.
The allegations against Loomis
have been laid before the State De
partment in Washington. Secretary-
Hay, acting Secretary Taft and Presi
dent Roosevelt are cognizant of them.
WASHINGTON, April 25.â First As
sistant Secretary of State Loomis de
clined to discuss in detail for publica
tion the charges current in Caracas,
that he had used his official position
on behalf of the New York and Ber
rr-udez Asphalt Company for his per
sonal advantage.
"Some of the details of the charges."
said Loomis. "are already known to
the President. In view of his atintlllPi
from Washington, it is Impossible for
me to discuss the matter. In due time
the charges will receive all the at
tention they deserve."
An official of the State Department
said tl:at little attention had been at
tracted by the charges made in Ca
racas untii recently, when they be
gan to assume a particularly virulent
form. They had now. however, he
said, developed In such manner as to
call for some definite and positive ac
tion. This, he intimated, would follow
immediately upon the return of Presi
dent Roosevelt from the South on May
25.
"I feel certain," continued this of
ficial, "that President Roosevelt will
go to the bottom of the case and will
call Mr. Bowen from Caracas to sub
stantiate his charges. It Is essential
that this be done for the honor of the
Diplomatic and State departments."
WITHDRAW HOPS

Â«rÂ«Â»cial DiÂ«pÂ»tch to The CÂ»!l
PORTLAND. April 25. â Oregon hop
growers have set the pace for the
world, and every one who buys hops
this year must pay a good, stiff price.
Of the 17.000 bales left unsold in this
State 13.895 were to-day withdrawn
from sale. The holders of the remain
ing hops are Jn harmony with the
members of the Oregon Hop Holders'
Protective Association, organized here
to-day. Conrad Krebs, one of the
largest dealers in the State, was elected
president.
For some months the big hop men
have been working up the gigantic hop
pool. Most of the prominent hop men
are In the city and were present at the
meeting held to-night in the Hotel
Portland. How far prices will go above
25 and 27 cents remains to be seen,
but the hop market of the world has
been seriously affected and grower? not
only on the Pacific '.'oast, but in Eng
land will realize better prices on ac
count of the big Oregt/n pool.
PRETTY FLORENCE BOYERE TELLS HOW
SHE FREED YOUNG WHITTELL.
One thousand dollars and a
promise he now repudiates to
pay $500 more is all it cost
George Whittell Sr. to secure
a release for his son from
Miss Horen.ee M. Boyere of
all claims for breach of
promise and seduction. Here
tofore it has been supposed
that Whittell Sr. paid the
pretty woman 825,000 to sur
render her claims, that his
son might take as his wife a
pretty society bud to whom
he was betrothed. These facto
came out in court yesterday
when MfcÂ« Boyere's suit to re
cover the $500 from Charles
F. Hanlon, Whittell Sr.'s at
torney, on acconnt of the
settlement went to trial. The
most interesting fact devel
oped, however, was that
WhitleU Sr. and his attorney
made desperate efforts to
keep tin* romance from be
t/ominp public, and it was
the publication that caused
them to repudiate the con
tract with the young woman
to pay her $500 when six
months had passed and
time had placed the seal of
sileiKf on what they termed
a scandal. In the defeat of
their object they found chag
rin. \~o\v MiÂ«s Bojrere must
fight for what she claims is
hers.
Small Sum of Gold
Bought Release
for Him.
PART YET UNPAID
Sues His Father to
Collect What
Is Due.
The story of the colossal fizzle that
waited on the effort of George Whit
, tell Sr. and Attorney Charles F. Han
1 lon to keep secret the facts of the pur
] ported marriage of George Whittell Jr.
la Miss Florence M. Boyere and the
j subsequent proceedings through which
f they secured a separation of the young
i counle is being told in detail in. Judge
Hunt's court. Heretofore it has been
1 supposed that the yu-ung woman re
ceived 125,000 for giving up the man
; she says she joined in wedlock, but this
j supposition was reached without due
i regard for the thrift that enabled
: Whittell Sr. to amass his millions.
j Yesterday it developed that the little
: woman in the case received only $1000
! at the time young Whittell was taken
â  from her side and a promise that $500
j more would be paid to her if no hint
i of the romance readied the columns of
' the public press.
Whitteli Sr. was more than anxious
that his son should marry a pretty so
ciety bud to whom he was engaged
when he yielded to the charms of Miss
Boyere and, she claims, wedded her.
This society bud, who, it is said, Is
now betrothed to another, had not
heard of young Whittells escapade, as
his father called it. It was calculated
that if Miss Boyere, or, as she safs she
was, Mrs. Whittell Jr., could be gotten
rid of a quiet explanation could be
made to the society bud, and a brilliant
wedding would set at rest any rumors
that might have gotten around regard
ing the less formal affair in which
Whittell Jr. was said to be a principal.
ABANDOXS HER CLAIMS.
Things progressed nicely and pretty
Mrs. Whittell Jr., as she called her
self, agreed, after a stormy scene, to
quit all claims to membership to the
family that held out no welcome for
her. Then Attorney Hanlon quietly
went to court and secured a decree de
claring that the alleged marriage was
not. In fact, valid. Next he made his
first mistake. Thinking to bury the
facts of the suit beyond resurrection,
he took the papers in the case and
carried them East with him. The pa
pers were missed from the files and the
storm began. The search for the doc
uments laid bare the story of the al
leged marriage and Miss Boyere's suits
for seduction and breach of promise.
The whole world was told the tale.
The society bud erased the memory of
Whittell Jr. from her heart and mind
with wonderful alacrity and, it is said,
it was not long before her heart was
claimed by another.
Whittell Sr. and Hanlon were aghast
at the failure of their plans and when,
Â»n May 10, ISO 4, six months to a day
after the original agreement was
signed. Miss Boyere demanded the $500
promised her, Hanlon refused to pay it,
for. he said, the contract had been
broken, the story of the marriage and
annulment had been printed and all the
cherished plans of Whittell Sr. had fall
en like a house of cards.
'But." explained Miss Boyere. "I
had nothing to do with the publica
tion. I refused to see interviewers that
called upon me, even after the facts
had been made public."'
HANLON INTERPRETS PAPER.
"That makes no difference," said
Hanlon. "The agreement was that if
the matter became public you should
not receive this money."
Then Miss Boyere took her case to
Attorneys I. I. Brown and Gavin Me-
Xab and they filed suit against Han
lon. Yesterday it came to trial.
Miss Boyere came lo court with her ,

counsel. She was gowned in blue,
white revers and cuffs giving a touch
of contrast. She is dark and exceed
ingly pretty, an artist of ability ana.
her lawyers and friends assert, a good
and loyal little woman. She glanced
nervously at Whittell Sr. as he en
tered the court with Attorney Han
lon. but was fully composed when
called to the stand.
She testified that no publication of
the facts of her romance with young
Whittell had been made through any
fault of hers and she had respected
fully the requirements of th<? agree
ment exacted of her, the most im
portant clause of which follows:
"If during the period of six months
no publication In the public press is
made of said suit, or the legal pro
ceedings therein, or of any of the mat
ters of said alleged breach of promise
or alleged marriage and no mention is
made of matters of relationship, or
matters of love, or matters of dis
agreement between the said George
Whittell Jr. and the said Florence M.
Boyere. then this obligation to pay
Florence M. Boyere the sum of $500
shall be In full force and effect, but
otherwise It shall be null and void."
FACTS BECOME PUBLIC.
The first time Miss Boyere knew
the facts had become public, she said,
was when a reporter called to see her
with copies of local newspapers set
ting forth that Attorney Hanlon had
stolen certain documents In the suit
brought against her and fled with them
to the East. Hanlon did not like this
reflection that he had "stolen" the
papers in the case, and protested ve
hemently, but McNab would have none
of it and insisted that the facts stand
as testified to.
"They have taken this little
woman," said McNab, "and fixed up a
contract by which they hope to swin
dle her out of this paltry sum they
have promised her to right the great
wrong done her. We will prove that
she had nothing to do with the pub
lication of the articles in the pre^s,
and they cannot escape their obliga
tion by making any such plea."
Miss Boyere was then questioned at
length as to whether she had been
a party to the publication of the ar
ticles, but she adhered rigidly to her
statement that she was not.
Then Attorney Henry Owens, who
represented Miss Boyere during the
negotiations looking to a settlement,
was called to the stand. He testified
it was his understanding that Miss
Boyere was to be paid the SSOO In
event she gave no facts of her relations
with Whittell Jr. to the press, but he
did not take it that she was to be
held responsible for the acts of others.
He said that after the contract was
signed and delivered Hanlon had
stated that it would be void in, event
anything got Into the press through
any source, but Owens would not" bind
his client to any such agreement.
The trial, which promise* more in
teresting developments, will be con
cluded this morning.

Special . Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK. April 25.â According to
officers of the White Star liner Cretic.
which arrived here to-day from Genoa.
Secretary of State John Hay almost
died on the way to Europe. One of
the officers of the Cretic said:
"In spite of the stories that Secre

fact that he almost died on the way

his stateroom and put to bed. Mrs.
Hay nursed him till she collapsed on
the second day out. For days it was
a question whether Secretary Hay
would live or not. The day before we
reached Genoa, Mr. Hay managed to
get up for the first time. He went
to the dining room supported by Lord
and Lady Gordon Lennox, but was
only able to remain there for a part
of the meal."

REBATES ONLY
FOR UNCLE SAM
"WASHINGTON, April 25.â The At
torney General to-day sustained the
Secretary of the Interior in his rebate
agreements with railroads, in connec
tion with the transportation of ma
terial for reclamation purposes. The
law which the Attorney General inter
prets as governing the case is contained
In section 22 of the Interstate Com
merce Act. Its language is "That noth
ing In this ac shall apply to the car
riage, storage or handling of property
free, or at reduced rates, for the Unit
ed States." The Attorney General
reaches this conclusion:
The Intention ol section 22 of the act to
regulate commerce was to give express sanc
tion to any arrangement between the United
BLates, State or municipal governments and
railroad companies by which those Govern
ments might relieve themselves of the cost of
transportation in whatever form it might as
sume and the section should be construed to
glvr effect to that intention.
In a statement given out in connec
tion with the abstract of the opinion,
the Secretary of the Interior has this
to say:
It has been noted that in the past few days
articles have appeared in the public press, with
reference â to certain . proposed concessions j and
agreements on the part of ' the railroad com
panies to transport material for . use in the
building of dams for the reclamation service
under thÂ« act of June 15, 1902. This subject
has - been before the Interior Department ? for
consideration and . action | and the | Secretary |on
March 20, v 1905. . relying - upon the language of
section 22 of what is known as the interstate
commerce act, held thai 'he was ' authorized â  to
secure agreements from railroad companies for
eonefsr.tons in favor of the Government for the
carrying of its own property or material to be
used by â¢. or on behalf . of the Government In
the construction of '. these 1 reclamation works.
The I Secretary -of the â  Interior â  later . deemed It
advisable to refer, the whole matter to the At

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. APRIL 26, 1905.
Russia's Mukden Losses
Not as Great as Stated
in the Earlier Reports
Aggregate Less Than Eighty- Eight Thousand
Men, and Many of the Wounded
Are Again in the Ranks.
OUNSHU PASS. Manchuria, April 25.
An exact statement of the losses in
all categories in the battle of Muk
den from February 1 to March 14, comp
iled by the general staff, shows that
the casualties were greatly overstated
in earlier reports. Statements from
Japanese sources indicating wholesale
captures of prisoners, enormous booty
and cannon are now denied.
In reality it appears the Russian
losses tc-taled two generais killed, two
taken prisoners, and 87,777 men, of
whom the greater part, about 55,000,
were wounded.
In evacuating Mukden and retreating
tcr the northward the Russians lost
thirty-two guns, of which three were
mortars, three old type field guns with
pistol action and twenty-six quick
flie guns.
Of the siege artillery every gun and
all the ammunition certs were sent
north two days before the retreat be
gan.
General Karkevitch, the' chief of
staff, calculates that other losses aside
from wounded were as follows: 15,000
killed. 7000 to 8000 known to have been
captured and 10.000 to 12,000 missing,
of whom several thousand were drivers,
sanitary and commissariat corps' em
ployes and other non-combatants.
A very large number were slightly
wounded and rtturned to the ranks,
many even resorting to deception in
order to leave the h^-spltals.
This would indicate tnat the extent
of the Japanese victory and the dis
order of the Russian retreat has been
exaggerated, and that the spirit of the
Russian army is still strong and the
troops not demoralized.
TRAINS RUN TO LIAOYANGk
Japanese Complete Repairs to the
Manchnrian Railroad.
FUSAN, Korea, April 25. â The first
railroad train from Liaoyang since the
retreat of the Russians from that
place last year reached Mukden sta
tion late yesterday, crossing the Hun
River on the temporary bridge which
has just been completed. Regular
trains will be run between Port Dalny
and Mukden In a few days. Quantities
of supplies are being sent to Tie Pass
from Newchwang in junks up the
Liao River.
SULTAN FACES
A GRAVE PERIL
APEX, Arabia, April 25. â The situa
tion in Turkish Arabia has become
critical. It transpires that only a
thousand of the Turkish troops sent
to the relief of Riza Pasha reached
Sanaa, and these fled thither after sus
taining: a defeat at the hands of the
insurgents.
Riza Pasha's troops, 6000 strong, en
countered the Arabs in great force five
miles south of Sanaa on March 30 and
after a sharp encounter most of the
troops, consisting: of Syrian reserves,
laid down their arms or deserted, the
remnant of the Turks managing to
reach Sanaa the same evening with
only fifty camel loads of supplies. The
chief of staff, Izzat Pasha, was killed
and seven guns were abandoned and
taken possession of by the Arabs, who
also captured 200 camels laden with
provisions and large quantities of rifles
and ammunition. The investment of
Sanaa by the insurgents is being tight
ened.
The Syrian reinforcements, which
recently arrived at Arabia, are un
satisfactory, and the officials are
anxiously awaiting the arrival of
European battalions, upon whom the
fate of the capital of Yemen province
depends.
LONDON, April 25.â Officials con
versant with the situation in Yemen
province regard the situation there as
being: in the nature of a life or death
struggle for the Sultan of Turkey.
They point out that the warlike Arabs
of Yemen, who have never done more
than impatiently tolerate the Turkish
yoke, have grown tired of paying taxeg
three or four times over and have re
volted. Should the rising in Yemen
succeed it is bound to spread north to
Hejaz, and if the Sultan's authority is
wiped out in that holy land of Mo
hammedanism he will lose all claims
to the title of Protector of the Holy
Plares, which is regarded as the main
factor in holding his empire together.
JUDGE RECEIVES
HARSH LETTER
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, April 26. â Unusual
language was used by Governor George
E. Chamberlain to-day in a letter ad
dressed to Circuit Judge Georere H.
Burnett. "Bluntness and brutality of
Cuccaneer"; '"insulting, arbitrary and
tyrannical," are some of the terms
used in the remarkable seven-Dace
epistle.
The Governor a day or two since
wrote to Judge Burnett In resrard to
granting a commutation of sentence
in favor of Otto Miller, serving three
months on a serious charge, to which
he pleaded guilty, after having first
been charged with a graver offense.
In his answer the Judge refused to
recommend executive clemency, and
Intimated that the Governor had al
ready made up his mind to pardon the
man. This remark was brought forth
by the fact that some time since the
Governor commuted, the next morning
after conviction, the sentence of a
saloon-keeper found guilty in Judge
Burnett's court of selling liquor to a
minor. This was done without con
sultation with the Judge and made him
very angry at the time.

TO TURN LIGHT
ON EQUITABLE
Friek Committee Prepares
to Begin Inquiry With
Insurance Superintendent
NEW YORK, April 25.â State Super
intendent of Insurance Hendricks, for
mer Attorney General Knox, counsel
for the Frlck investigating committee,
and Henry C. Frick, chairman of the
so-called "Frick Committee," were in
conference here" to-da*y regarding
Equitable matters. Nothing in the
way of a statement was issued after
tha sessions to-day, but it was under
stood that the men in conference had
agreed to combine in the investigation.
Tht- Frick committee also held several
meetings to-day and a number of wit
nesses were called, but the results
were not made public.
Among the interesting stories current
in financial circles to-day was one that
General Nelson A. Miles would be sug
gested by the New England policy
holders for the presidency of the Equit
able. This, however, appeared to be
merely a matter of gossip.
James J- Hill, who was selected by
the directors of the Equitable Life
Assurance Society as one of the com
mittee to investigate into its affairs,
said to-day that his own affairs took
up so much of his time that he had no
spare moments to devote to other mat
ters. Hill added: ' I have been a
policy holder in the Equitable Life for
over thirty years, and I say as a policy
holder that the time has come when
the whole business of life insurance
must be more carefully managed."
ALBANY, N. V., April 25.â Attorney
General Mayer to-day sent a letter to
Senator Edgar Braokett referring to
the petition filed recently by the latter
in behalf of Mary S. Young of Sara
toga, asking the Attorney General's
consent to the beginning of an action
against certain directors of the Equit
able Life Assurance Society. The At
torney General points out that
Brackett's client^ as a stockholder in
the Equitable Life Assurance Society,
can without the consent or participa
tion of the Attorney General bring an
action in equity to compel the officials
of the company to account for any
funds unlawfully diverted by them.

MILWAUKEE
CALM AFTER
ITS PANIC
Financial Flinty Following
Gigantic Defalcation, of
Banker Bigelow Comes to
an End on the Second Day
CONFIDENCE ONCE
AGAIN RESTORED
Henry G. (roll, the Assistant
Cashier Who Is Said to
Have Been a Party to the
Shortage, i\ot Yet Found
MILWAUKEE, Wis., April 25.âCon
fidence has again been restored inÂ»
banking institutions of Milwaukee, and
the run on the First National Bank
and the Milwaukee Trust Company,
which was caused by the $1,450,000 de
falcation by Frank G. Blgelcw, until
Monday president of the bank, Is a
thing of the past and Danking affairs
in Milwaukee have resumed their nor
mal condition. While the two banks
affected are entirely separate institu
tions, the fact that they occupy ad
joining buildings and that some of the
First National's direct the af
fairs of the Milwaukee Trust Company,
caused many of the depositors to be
lieve that one was a part of the other.
Before the hour for opening the
banks had arrived to-day a meeting
of the Milwaukee Clearing House As
sociation was held and a committee of
that Institution, after examining the
assets and collateral of the First Na
tional Bank, issued a reassuring report
as follows:
"The Milwaukee Clearing House As
sociation, after examining carefully all
the assets and collateral of the First
National Bank of Milwaukee, reports
as a result from such examination that
they are satisfied that the said bank
is perfectly solvent and able to pay its
debt*."
BANKS REQUIRE TIME.
This report was printed in large type
on placards and pasted on the win
dows of the First National Bank and
also displayed in store windows on
Wisconsin and East -^Water streets.
Following this was a statement issued
by the board of directors of the First
National Bank, announcing with abso
lute positiveness that the bank was per
fectly solvent. On top o-f this came
word from the board of directors of the
Milwaukee Chamber of Commerce, an
nouncing its decision not to withdraw
Its current expense fund from the First
National. All of these statements had
a reassuring effect on depositors as to
the stability of the banks.
The banks affected were well able to
cope with a long run, but it was de
cided by all of the banks in the city
to take advantage of the law on time
deposits, requiring a notice of thirty
days of withdrawal on amounts less
than $100 and ninety days where the
amounts exceed that sum. As rapidly
as the depositors appeared at the
wickets of the savings departments of
the affected institutions their pass
books were stamped, acknowledging
the notice of withdrawal, and the de
positors took their departure. It re
quired only about two hours to dis
pose of the line of depositors.
Early in tha day crowds of men and
women in all walks of life gathered
In line two and four abreast and took
up positions in front of the two big
banking institutions, and awaited the
opening of the strong doors at 10
o'clock. The line extended about half
a square on East Water and Wisconsin
streets from the main entrance of each
institution. The crowd was orderly
and gave no trouble to the police.
One of the most spectacular happen
ings of the day was the action of
Mayor Rose in walking down Wiscon
sin street In full view of the crowd
with $500,000 In currency and gold in
canvas bags. He was surrounded by
policemen and detectives and walked
Into the bank with trfe treasure. This
money was part of the shipment from
Chicago banks and some from other
Milwaukee banks.
Cashier Frank J. Klpp is authority
for the statement that much more than
$2,000,000 was received during the day
by the bank. At noon the street as
sumed its normal appearance and the
run was over. The First National
Bank Is depository for Government
'departments In Milwaukee, the funds
Including those of the Internal Revenue
office and of the offices in the Depart
ment of Justice. None will be with
drawn-
BIGELrOW REMAINS AT HOME.
According to the Federal provision,
a prisoner cannot plead guilty until
he be indicted by the Grand Jury.
Bigelow therefore will not appear in
court until the Grand Jury has con
sidered his case. Assistant United
States District Attorney Hennings
Bays that in all probability only one in
dictment can be returned, but that
there may be a number of counts in
separate instances. The Grand Jury
is called by the United States District
Judge. While the date has not been
set, it is understood that it will be
about the middle of May.
Bigelow spent the day at his home
and declined to be interviewed. Up
to a late hour no trace had been found
of Henry G. Goll, the deposed assist
ant cashier of tha First National
Bank. . -
State funds amounting to nearly
$500,000 will not be withdrawn from
the First National Bank. This con
clusion was reached after a confer
ence between State officials and local
bankers to-day. The State officials, it
Is said, were given a complete state
ment regarding the finances of the
bank.
C. H. Bosworth, the national bank
examiner at Chicago, who was ordered
by the United States Comptroller of the
Currency to make an investigation of
the affairs of the First National Bank,
took up the work to-day.
SANDY HILL, N. V., April 25.â

TAFT SAYS
THE RATES
WILL FALL
Panama : Rail Tariffs, to
Be Rearranged Regardless
of the Effect Upon the
Transcontinental Railroads
GOVERNMENT EXPECTS
TO EEAP NO PKOFIT
Line Across the Isthmus
Will Charge Xo More
Than Is Necessary to
Pay Operating Expenses
WASHINGTON, April 25.â Secretary
Taft has made a decision that is of the
greatest importance to railroad inter
est, respecting the policy of the Gov
ernment relative to the existing
monopoly of traffic across the Isthums
of Panama and the fixing of rates over
the Panama Railroad, as bearin- on
the existing rates on transcontinental
traffic.
Secretary Taft makes it plain that
there Is to be no discrimination what
ever as between the several steamshiD
companies In handling their business
across the isthmus. He does not ex
pect any considerable effedt ur>on
transcontinental frame from a re
arrangement of Panama railroad rates,
but that readjustment will be had re
gardless of such effect. In a letter an
nouncing his policy the Secretary says:
The policy of tho Government In managing
the Panama Railroad is to charge such rates
as will pay for the carriage of the goods
across the isthmus, a reasonable return on
the investment of the Government and nothing
mere. It will permit no discrimination against
or in favor of any of U)e connecting; steamship
lines. It may be that thrs policy will affect
the transcontinental rates on those classes of
freight that can stand the isthmus trip, favor
able for the shipper. However, Mr. Wallace,
our chief engineer and a railway man of expe
rience, thinks that the proposed changes will
not have much influence en transcontinental
rates, because, he thinks, but a small propor
tion of -tb^t which goes to make up trans
continental freight can be carried by the isth
mus. The long trip and the fact that the
merchandise carried is to be a considerable
period in the tropics exclude the possibility of
carrying many k'.nds.
FRjDKRAL, STEAMSHIP RATES.
The Panama Railroad Company owns three
steamships, which ply bet ween- New York and
Colon. We shall make the rate upon thÂ»*a<Â»
ships as low ac possible, consistent with pay
ing a reaonable compensation for the car
riage and investments. VÂ»*e shall run them
merely for tho purpose of preventing a com
bination to raise the rates from the United
States to the Isthmus on mat-rial that is to bi
used in the construction of the canal.
The Government it not running and doÂ»e
not expect to run a line between New York
and San Francisco, or between San Francisco
and New Tork.
The policy of the Panama Railroad Company
heretofore. In view of Its ownership of three
ships and the docks at Colon and its resulting
ability to exclude from the New York and
Colon business a*y other steamship line, has
been to monopolise the trade between New
') rk and Panama, on the one side, while its
arrangement for exclusive through billing be
tween New Tork and San Francisco wirh the
Pacific Mall Steamahip Company produced a
monopoly for the Pacific Mail on the other, be
tween Panama and San Francisco on the
north, and a monopoly for the Chilean and
Pacific Steamship companies from Panama to
the south. So far as the aotton of the Pana
ma Railroad Company can break up the mon
opoly, it Is being taken.
ThÂ» Government's acquisition of the raiNÂ»av
line was not primarily for the purpose of af
fecting railway or ocean rates, transcontinen
tal or otnerwlse. It was for the purpose of
acquiring an instrument with which to con
struct the canal, an Instrument absolutely In
dispensable for the accomplishment of our
purpose within a reasonable time. The in
cident that we must hold the railroad under
a franchise requiring us to do a commercial
Business is what imposes upon us the obli
gation to do what w? can to make Just rates
and prevent discrimination, and this we shall
do. If this ameliorates conditions we shall be
very clad. If it does not, it will not be In
our power to do morÂ».
PREDICTIONS ARE WASTED.

conditions la so elusive that it Is hardly safe
to make a prediction as to th? result. One
should study the local conditions which pre
vail at Panama and at the many ports be
tween Panama and San Francisco. In Mexico
and Central America and should estimate tha
exact operation of our coastwise laws, which
prevent the Intervention of foreign shipping
Ir. the via the Isthmus between San
Franclaco and New York before expressing an
oritiion as to the effect of the GovernmÂ«nfÂ»
operation of the Panama Railroad upon thÂ«
rate between our west and east coasts.
An attempt has been made here to estab
lish an American line competing with the
Pacific Mall line between San Francisco and
Panama, with the assistance of the Panama
Railroad Company. It proved to be a dis
astrous failure and was followed by a renewal
of the discriminating contract which is to
terminate in July next.
It is possible that the time Is now rtpÂ«
for the establishment of American competition
with the Pacific Mall hetween San Francisco
and Panama. Certainly the Government in
operating thÂ» Panama Railway will do nothing
to hinder It. Nevertheless It Is possible that
th* position of advantage that the Pacttlc Mall
has with respect to Mexican and Central
American trade and Its ownership of a dock
at Colon may enable it to establish lines on
both sides, which will do all the through
business and fix the rates without enjoying
any discrimination In ltÂ« favor by the Panama
Railroad. If *>, the Government could not
prevent this, except by running a line from
Panama to San Francisco for the purpoe*.
which it cannot do.

Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
GLENWOOD SPRINGS, CHo.. April
25. â President Roosevelfs hunting trip
has been crowned with success far be
yond his expectations or those of the
most "sanguine of his guides. Thrqp
bears were killed by the party to-dajr
and two yesterday, one by the Presi
dent and one by Dr. Lambert.
P. B. Sicwart of Colorado Springs^
one of the President's hunting compan
ions, arrived here to-night, acconv*
panied by Courier Chapman. They
brought the story of the hunt. News
of the killing of the three bears was
telephoned to them and they under
stood that President Roosevelt brought
down two of them, but the details arÂ«
lacking.
The party is almost snowbound in its
present location and no attempt will
be made to cross the divide. Fifteen
feet of snow is on the ground ira th*
other side and any effort to reach Red
stone would be futile. The hunters
are satisfied, however, for they hayÂ»
reached the center of what the guides
say is the best bear country in Colo
rado.
Bobcats are thick in the country now
being hunted â Â«o plentiful, in fact, that
many are allowed to escape without a
shot being fired in their direction. Sev
eral fine skina have been taken, how
ever.
The bear killed by the President yes
terday was of the brown variety â not
so heavy, but with a much finer pelt
than the first animal killed. One *
the bears killed to-day is said to have
been a grizzly.
It was within an area of seven miles
that all five of the bears were kilied.
This spot is about sixteen or eighteen
miles from camp and every animal
gave the dogs and hunters a long
chase. All of them treed, which en
abled the hunters to kill them without
further accident to the dcrgs.
News of the outside world is scarce
in the President's camp. Once in four
or five days dally papers are sent in.
but these are twelve huurs or more
old when they reach Newcastle.
"The absence of information of cur
rent events. Is greatly fe4t by ail, par
ticularly by the President," said dte- '
wart to-night. But tnen He went into
the wilds to hunt and he h+a to make
the best of it. We have been living
well. Supplies are holding out well and
now bear steaks will be on the bHI of
fare regularly. No icebox is needed up
there to kÂ»iep the meat fresh. The
camp is situated at an altitude of
about 9000 feet and there is deep snow
on every side."

POPULAR BODY
FOR TRANSVAAL
LONDON, April 25.â The draft of the
new Transvaal Constitution was issued
to-day. It provides for a progressive
Assembly or Volksraad, consisting of
the Lieutenant Governor, six to nine
official members and thirty to thirty
five elected members. Every burgher
of the late South African republic is
entitled to vote for members of the
first Volksraad. The same right is
granted to all white males of British
birth occupying premises at an annual
rental of not less than $50 or having
capital to the value of $500, unless con
victed of treason since May 31, 1902,
or of murder. These restrictions are
removed where a free pardon has been
granted.
A commission will divide the Trans
vaal into electoral districts. The de
bates in the Assembly will be carried
on in English, but the president of the
Volksraad may permit a member to
use the Dutch language- Financial
measures must be recommended to the
Assembly by the Governor and no part
of the revenue may be apportioned
without his authority.
In a communication to Lieutenant
Governor Tawley, accompanying the
letters patent providing for the
changes. Colonial Secretary Littelton
says the time is not yet ripe to grant
full self government. The matter in
volves party government and this in
the Transvaal will become more prac
ticable when the two races have acted
longer together under equal rights and
when bitter memories have become
softened by time. In regard to the
colored population not being directly
represented in the Volksraad, any bill
subjecting them to special disability or
restriction must have the sanction of
the home Government before it becomes
operative. Secretary Littelton explains
that similar constitutional changes can
not be extended to the Orange River
colony immediately, because the in
dustrial and economic conditions there
do not so urgently demand them.
NORFOLK, Va., April 25.â General
Cronje. who was a member of Presi
dent Kruger's cabinet for twelve years
and a noted Boer leader, and who Is on

port of the new constitution just is

breach of the treaty of peace, made us
by England at Vereeniging on May 31,
1902, which promised us self-govern
ment as soon as our country was in a

CZAR'S MEANING
IS MADE CLEAR
ST. PETERSBURG, April 25.â "My
will regarding the convocation of rep
resentatives of the people is unswerv
ing and the Minister of the Interior
is making every effc/rt for its speedy
realization."
Emperor Nicholas, receiving in audi
ence at Tsarskoe-Selo on Sunday the
Marshal of the nobility of Kostroma, a
Government of middle Russia, directed
that the foregoing message be com
municated to the nobility of Kostroma.
The message evidently was designed to
be published to quiet the fears of those
who are impatient at the delays and
who have grown skeptical of the ful
fillment of the promises contained in
the imperial rescript.
It is very significant that the Em
peror used the words "Convocation erf
representatives of the people," thus go
ing beyend the expression employed In
the rescript and setting at rest all
doubt as to his meaning.
A rumor is circulated here to the ef
fect that Emperor Nicholas will mark
Easter by the proclamation erf general
amnesty for political and religious
prisoners now confined in the fort
resses or prisons of European Russia
or who are in exile.
Fears that the Easter holidays, which
extend over thirteen days, will be the
occasion for bloody riots are mani
fested everywhere and the population
is becoming decidedly panicky over the
rumors which are circulating of mur
der, pillage and terrorism by mobs in
various parts of the country. Even
churches, according to the stories told,
are not exempt.
SOSNOVICE, Russian Poland, April
25. â Great disorders are expected here
at Easter time. The town is full of
troops. Russian officials are receiving
letters threatening them with massacre
and the workmen have been deluged
with proclamations signed by the Po
lish revolutionary committee, warning
them net to heed those who advise
them to kill the Jews, but instead to
kill all such persons. The proclama
tions are directed against the police,
who are charged with attempting a
diversion against the Jews.
DISPUTE ARISES AMONG
DAUGHTERS OF REVOLUTION
Mrs. McLean, the President. Refuses
to Recognize the Vice Regent
for Montana.
WASHINGTON, April 25. â At a

agers of the Daughters of the Amer
ican Revolution Mrs. McLean, the
newly-elected president general, re
fused to recognixe Mrs. Walter Weed
of Washington, D. C. as the duly
elected vice regent for Montana. Mrs.
McLean's ground^ for her refusal to
recognize Mrs. Weed as a member of
the board was that the election had
not been certified by the congress.
Mr?. Draper, who managed Mrs. Mc-
Lean's campaign, declared that she
had letters from Montana proving that
Mrs. Weed was not the choice of the

STOCKTON. April 25. â The Hes
pi;in fly i.Â« infesting the wheat fields of
this lounty. John <JraUan, an expe
rienced farmer, made the discovery.
â¢itly on his son's farm Qrattan no
ticed that the grain, which i? nearly
two feet high, is showing: yellow and
beginning to die. He pulled up sev
eral samples and upon searching cure
fully among the roots found several
â mall larvae or grubs at work. When
placed under a microscope the grubs
closely resemble â  date. They are
small and -can only be detected by
c.ireful observation. As many as six
of tlinm were found in one root.
Florin Swain, who formerly farmed
extensively In Illinois, states that he
believes the pest is the Hessian fly. At
any rate, he says it closely resembles
the peat which devastated the great
wheat fields of Illinois a few years
ago.
M;my San Joaquin farmers who no
ticed the unhealthy condition of their
crops attributed it to what is com
monly known as rust. Swain fears he
will ios.- all of his grain and George
Hildreth and John Swain believe their
crops also are doomed.

Special Dispatch to The Cs.ll.
SACRAMENTO. April 25.â Senator
Harry Bunkers made a sorry exhibi
tion of himself in the Superior Court
during his trial for bribery this after
noon, and was severely reprimanded by
Judge Hart from the bench In the
presence of the jury.
Bunkers was called to the stand by
the defense to enter a general denial
of the charge that he had accepted
money from Joseph Jordan to influence
his official action with respect to cer
tain building and loan associations.
On cross-examination District Attor
ney Seymour questioned Bunkers as to
his earlier occupations. "I don't know
what I did for a living then," respond
ed the deposed Senator, "I was too
damned young."
Judge Hart wheeled quickly around
in his chair in astonishment. The Dis
trict Attorney did not intend that the
court should mistake the nature of the
remark.
"So you were too damned young to
know what you were doing at that
time, were you?" said the District At
torney.
Judge Hart sharply admonished Bun
kers that he was giving testimony in
a court of law and that he should use
more respectful language. Bunkers
tried to excuse himself by saying he
had used the word "darned" and did
net desire to be profane. The court
told him that even that word would
not do. Bunkers disregarded the warn
ing, however, and was again repri
manded by the Judge. Later on Bun
kers referred to some women compan
ions as "Fairies," and was once mort
reminded by the cou^t that he was too
flippant in his speech.
â You met Joseph Jordan in a X
street saloon one night, didn't you?"
asked the District Attorney.
"Me; not me," replied Bunkers in a
manner of affected lightness. Again in
response to a question as to whether
anybody else was present on a certain
occasion, he replied: "Oh, yes; severi
al," using the last word in its slang
form.
District Attorney Seymour succeed
ed in tangling up Bunkers in several
particulars. His manner on the stand
was that of a man who had no cc-ncern
for the seriousness of his position or
the impression he might make upon
Judge and jury.

Special DiEpatch to Tha Call.
OMAHA, Neb., April 25.â Thomas
Henry Tibbies, candidate at the last
election for Vice President on the Na
tional Populist ticket, is preparing to
put his financial theories to a practi
cal test. With the backing of wealthy
friends whose views on sociological
topics correspond with his own, he will
found a bank in New York
which will be conducted on the prin
ciple that every depositor has a right
to know every detail of the bank's
transactions.
"I believe," said Mr. Tibbies, to-day,
"that every bank should be a mutual
institution. My statements will show
to each depositor where his money is
and how r it is to be taken care of. At.
present the gamblers take the money
cf the people and use it in speculative
and dangerous deals.
"Honesty and publicity will be the
bulwarks of the institution. Every
cashier's slip will be accessible to the
public. The account of every man
will be public property and at the end
of each day a detailed statement of
the business transacted will be open to
those who wish to investigate. No
bank officer will be permitted to borrow
of the bank funds."
Tibbies vigorously denounces present
day banking methods as the schemes
of the dishonest and declares the bank
examiner system to be a farce.

Giustin, a member of the Federal
Grand 'Jury which indicted Senator
Mitchell, was duly qualified to serve,
was supported. The defense contended
that Giustin was not a citizen of the
United States. Judge Bellinger holds
that Heney proved Giustin's citizenship
by means of affidavits.
Senator Mitchell was present in the
courtroom when the decision was read.
That he was greatly disappointed was
evident to all who watched him as the
reading of the decision proceeded. The
decision in effect decides all the pleas
in abatement filed by the numerous
defendants in the land frauds cases
and removes all obstacles to their trial
on the real issues.

TEXAS RANGERS
TAKE CONTROL
Restore Order in the Town
of H(;mpstead Where Con
oressman Was Murdered
TBOUBLE AT AN EXD
Interference of the Liquor
Element in Prohibitionist
Meeting Causes Tragedy
HEMPSTEAD. Texas. April 25. â
As a result of the bloody battle here
last night, when four men were killed
and others wounded. Hempstead is to
night under the control of the Texas
Rangers. Martial law has not been
declared, but the adjutant general ar
rived to-night with a number of
Rangers and assumed charge of af
fairs. No one is permitted to bear
arms. The excitement manifested
throughout the day has quieted to
night and further trouble is unlikely.
Holland Brown, son of one of the
men killed at the Prohibition mass
meeting last night, was to-day placed
under arrest on a charge of.- firing
the shot which killed Representative
Pinckney. He stated that his father
was under the influence of intoxicants
when he entered the meeting and that
he attempted to dissuade his father
from attending. His father was firm
in his intention and went to the meet
ing. The son followed and took part
in the shooting.
It has been established that the
trouble began when Captain Brown
attempted to secure recognition to
speak at the meeting. It is said that
his language was offensive to several
ladies present, and the shooting soon
after began. Congressman Pinckney
was shot four times and was almost
Instantly killed. Thomas Pinckney, a
brother of the Congressman, was snot
twice in the back and killed. and
Captain Brown received a bullet
through his heart. John E. Mills, the
fourth victim, took no part in the
affair and was accidentally killed by a
stray bullet.
A prohibition movement in Waller
County was begun some years ago,
and the feeling has been intense. An
election was held in Waller County on
April 20. and the Prohibitionists, with
whom the Pinckneys were affiliated,
were successful. The Prohibitionist
League was called together last night
to wind ud its affairs and disband. A
resolution requesting the Governor of
Texas to send troops to Waller County
for the purpose of enforcing the law
against liquor sellers was excitedly de
bated. It was at this juncture that
Captain Brown, who had figured
prominently as an anti-Prohibitionist,
sought to have the chairman recognize
him, and soon afterward the firing
began.
DETECTTVE MISTAKEN
FOR BORDER DESPERADO
Noted Foe of Outlaws Arrested by
an Overzealous Colorado
Sheriff.
DENVER. April 25. â The man ar
rested as Ed Franks, the "Black
Jack" outlaw and one of the most
dangerous bandits now at large, has
been identified by Judge Gavin of the
New Mexico District Court as Robert
Irving McManus, a detective for the'
cowmen, a man who has fought out
laws all his life.
"I met Franks many years ago."
said Judge Gavin to-day while at Den
ver, "so I know him well. When I
was at Raton the other day I went
over to the jail to see him. It took
one glance for me to convince myself
that it was not Franks, but McManus.
whom the Sheriff had arrested."

At tne Columbia Theater next Mon

the most interesting achievements of

Mr. Frohman does not rely solely up
on the artistic strength and popularity

RAND SCORES A POINT
Autopsy Surgeon O'Hanlon
Asserts His Abandonment
of the Theory of Suicide
NEW YORK, April 25.â Perhaps the
most interesting develppment in the
testimony of to-day in the trial of
Nan" Patterson for the murder of
"Caesar" Young came when Coroner's
Physician OHanlon took the witness
stand for the prosecution and said in
reply to questions that he had changed
his opinion that Young had committed
suicide. Dr. O'Hanlon performed the
autopsy on Young's body. In his tes
timony to-day he said:
"My present opinion is not the opin
ion I formerly expressed to Coroner
Brown."
He did not know of the relations of
Young and the defendant at the time
the report was made, he said. In reply
to Levy, however, he admitted that he
had expresssed the opinion that it was
a Ccise of suicide even after he had
heard the facts of the relations be
twet-r. Miss Patterson and Young. He
said that he was influenced in his first
decision that Young committed suicide
by black spots on the inside of the dead
man's fingers, which he believed to be
powder stains. This testimony came at
the close of the day's proceedings in
the trial.
When court opened. Miss Patterson
appeared in a black and white checked
dress, in direct contrast to the mourn
ing costume which she had worn dur
ing previous days c/f this and previous
trials.
Counsel for J. M. Smith and his wife
served notice to-day on District Attor
ney Jerome that he will make a mo
tion to-morrow before Judge Foster in
General Sessions for the dismissal of
the indictments against his clients. In
his affidavits the lawyer says that there
is no evidence to show that his clients
conspired against "Caesar" Young, as
the evidence of Stern, the pawnbroker,
does not in any way connect them with
the case; that most, if not all, of the
evidence given before the Grand Jury
was in response to leading questions
and was really the testimony of As
sistant District Attorney Rand and not
of the witness, and that it would not
be admitted in any court.
POLICY RATES
ARE INCREASED
NEW YORK, April 25.â An increase
of 3 to 6 per cent In the premium rates
for policies which do not confer upon
their holders a right to participate In
the dividends of the company has been
put into effect by four of the largest
life insurance companies in this
country.
The new rates of the different com
panies are essentially the same. On or
dinary life policies the increase over
old rates is between 5 and 6 per cent.
This is the largest increase. On limited
payment life and endowment policies,
the advance is between 3 and 5 per
cent, varying somewhat according to
the iige of the insured.
The advance in rates follows com
plaints made by holders of participat
ing policies that the difference between
the rates charged for a non-participat
ing pulley and those charged for a pol
icy that participated in the profits of
the company have in some instances
amounted to more than the dividends
paid to the participating policy holders.

LOS ANGELES, April 25.â Nineteen
months ago Rev, H. W. Knickerbocker,
for three years pastor of Trinity M. E.
Church South, and later deposed for
heresy, went to Goldfleld. He engaged
in mining and to-day has amassed a

buggy, a broken wrist and was broke
myself." he said to-night, on his re

Knickerbocker went to a mining su

work that he got it, though he had to
use a pick with one hand. He took
his place beside the hard-handed
toilers and kept at it* eleven days,
when a barrow of ore fell on him-
Soon afterward he bought from two
prospectors six claims for $5 and then
commenced to prospect, soon selling
out for $1400 and buying more. Now
he owns thirty claims and has an in

8pÂ«clÂ«J Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, April 25.â General Greely,
chief signal officer of the army, has
decided that Seward shall not be the
terminus of the Resurrection Bay ex
tension of the Government cable. This
decision is the result of a misunder
standing between signal corps officials
and John E. Ballaino, who has charge
of the selling of Seward townsite lots.
When the Government proposed lo
cating the cable terminus at Seward,
the matter of securing a site from
Ballaine was taken up. He offered
one lot free and asked $1500 for a sec
ond lot. which the Government needed.
Major Glassford opposed this. Bal
laine wrote a sharp letter of criticism
to General Greely. By telegraph.
General Greely now sustains Major
GlasÃford and directs that the termi

STREAM STILL RISING
People Dwelling Along the

TRINIDAD. Colo., April 25.â Melting
snow caused the Las Anlmas River to
become a torrent to-day, resulting in
considerable damage to the new Santa
Fe fill here, which is in danger of be
ing washed away. Three hundred men
are riprapping the bank with ties
spiked to railroad rails and trainloads
of rock are being dumped along the
bank directly in front of the Cardenas
He-tel and the new depot In course of
construction. The Rio Grande has a
train of loaded cars standing on its
bridge to prevent it from going out.
The temporary wagon bride connect
ing North and South Trinidad went
out to-night. The business section of
Trinidad is still cut off from its water
supply and conditions are alarming.
The Colorado and Southern passenger
train from Fort Worth was stuck in
a snow drift four hours at Emery Gap
and was finally dug out by relief
crews.
The river is still rising and all fam
ilies have moved from the bottoms to
the hillsides. Should the weather con
tinue warm a big flood is expected to
morrow.
GALLUP, N. M., April 25.â The flood
situation on the Atchlson, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railroad is practically un
changed to-night and it is regarded as
very doubtful if any through trains can
be moved before late to-morrow, if
then. If the present rain continues
conditions will constantly grow worse.
All westbound trains are being held
at Albuquerque excepting the Califor
nia limited train. No. 3. which left
Albuquerque at 9 p. m. last night and
arrived here this evening, proceeding
westward.
OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla., April 25.
Reports from the southern portion of
the Territory indicate that the storm
last night was a destructive one. The
bridge over Salt Fork of the Red

Rock Island bridge over Wold River
was partially wrecked. Rain and hail
caused much damage to crops. Floods
are feared along the larger streams.
MANY WASHOUTS
ARE REPORTED
LOS ANGELES, April 25.â The scene
of the most serious trouble caused by
the rains in New Mexico and Arizona
has shifted from between Blue Water
and Grants, where an extensive wash
out in the track was repaired to-day,
to Horace, eight miles east of Grants.
Bridge No. 90, over the Rio San Jose,
just at the west switch at Horace, is
in a very dangerous condition and may
go out at any moment. Train No. 3
succeeded in creeping across the shaky
structure last night and was laid up at
Grants until the break at Blue Water
was repaired to-day. When No. 3 ar
rived at Gallup this evening there was
general rejoicing among the marooned
passengers on the eastbound trains,
who made a break for their trains,
thinking the line was clear and they
would be released from their long and
irksome captivity in Gallup. The dis
appointment was great when they
learned of the new break at Horace.
The Santa Fe Company is looking
after the comfort of its passengers and
has issued meal checks to all holders
of first-class tickets who have been de
layed twenty-four hours or lonsrer.
There has been no serious discomfort
among the passengers so far: but.
should the delay be long continued,
there undoubtedly will he considerable
suffering. The Santa Fe line east of
Blue W r ater for several miles is built
on a foundation of a lava formation
and is in a generally soft condition.
The present long continued rain has
about put this stretch of track out of,
commission.
The bridge at Horace Is a pile trestle
structure 104 feet long. All the men
who have been repairing the washouts
at Blue Water and other points were
rushed to Horace this afternoon and
will make every effort to brace up the
bridge so as to restore traffic, tempor
arily at least.
Should the rain continue it is very
difficult to say when trains can be
moved in either direction. The snow
is very deep in the mountains and all
streams are running bank full, in some
places overflowing the lowlands. The
last train to get through was the Cali
fornia limited, which left Los Angeles
Saturday evening and which passed
east from here at 4p. m. Sunday. The
first train to be sent east after the
damage is repaired will be the Cali
fornia limited, which left Los Angeles
Sunday evening.
Late to-night it is reported that a
long stretch of track near Alaska, just
east of Horace, is under water and that
fifteen telegraph poles are down eighty
miles west of Gallup- Another washout
is reported at Rio Perco, thirty-four
miles west of Albuquerque.

OAKLAND, April 25. â "Madame
Begina Ruff." hypnotist, clairvoyant
Â«nd psychologist, after one month of
rapid fire practice of her varied tal
ents, has disappeared from Oakland*
leaving a train of mourning dupes, the
first one of whom disclosed her iden
tity to the police to-day in the person
of Mrs. Charles Steams, wife of a
Southern Pacific Company engineer,
ho parted with $700 worth of as
sorted jewels after a hypnotic seance
.â¢wjth the fugitive older of the past,
present and future.
It took exactly ten days for Mrs.
Steams to realize she had been made
a :im of the clever operator. But
the Santa Cruz woman's experience
Â»-jbs exceptionally bitter in that she
stripped herself of her dead father's
â¢sjifts in the alluring belief that by
transferring them to me clairvoyant
â be should be brought into communion
"with his spirit.
"Madame Ruff" opened her parlors
March 11 in the Eva building. 525
Fourteenth street. She won patrons
by the hundred*. They came from
Cities all around the bay. Not a few
handed over large amounts of money.
On April 1$ Mrs. Steams appeared and
forty-eight hours later, after turning
over her gems, discovered that her ad
viser had decamped. Mrs. Steams
conferred with her husband. He
headed straight for the police. A war
rant for "Madame Ruff's*' arrest was
â¢worn to without delay.
Ever since her disappearance the
Eva building has been overrun with
the missing woman's credulous pa
trons. The police estimate she has
cleaned up about $3000.
The "Reglna Ruff" is only profes
sional. Prosaic Mr. and Mrs. Wil-
Hams were the names given by the
operator and a man she introduced as
her husband, who is also missing. The
last word she left at the building was
that she intended to go automobiling
la San Francisco on Sunday, April 16.
Mrs. Steams' father was T. J. Weeks ,
cf Santa Cruz. The gems she handed
over to the clairvoyant, as listed by
the police were:
On* (old, satin finished, open-face Swiss
watch. -No. 10*2Â»80, ste-n winder, diamond m

BUSY DAY
FOR BUDS
AND BELLES
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND, April 25.â The gods were pro
pitious to-day and in spite of the frowning
weather that greeted anxious eyes this morn
ing the day was warm and pleasant and per
mitted the maids and matrons who partici
pated in several smart affairs to don their
lTf-ttlest summer gowns. And such a very
busy day It has been!
First there was the Havens luncheon for
Miss Smith, then the Black reception for Miss
Annette King and the evening brought thÂ«
Beiden dinner, at which Miss Smith and her
tijuice, Roland Oliver, were the honored
guests.
The luncheon over which M^>. F. C. Havens
presided was an elaborate affair, carried out
with that attention to artistic details that has
made Mrs. Havens famous as a hostess.
White forget-me-nots and tiny pink buds
formed the principal decoration of the round
table, orange blossoms threaded the scheme
like a motif in music. Place cards, favors
and even the little original toasts in rhyme
wera suggestive of the bridal blossoms. Or
chrstrai music added to the delight of the oc
casion. Mrs. Havens' guests ware Miss Ma
rlon Smith, Mrs. F. M. Smith, Miss Grace
Sperry, Miss Evelyn Ellis. Mrs. Wickham
Havens, Mrs. Harold Havens, Mrs. Harry M.
Maxwell, Mrs. Harmon Bell, Mn>. John C.

White, Miss Kthcl Moore, Miss Helen
Chase, Miss Noelle de Golla, Miss Florence
Hush, Miss Lucretla Burnham, Mrs. Edward
Engs, Miss Edith Gaskill, Miss Winifred
Burdge and Miss Pauline For*.
Mrs. Perole Black's tea for her sister, Miss
King, whose engagement to Theodore Jenkins
was recently announced, was one of the day's
prettiest affairs.
The spacious rooms of the Bromwell man
sion, where the -. Blacks reside, were abloom
with roses and delightfully suggestive of
spring. There were any number of â . stunning
gowns, the dainty little bride-to-be , herself
wearing one of thÂ» prettiest I have seen this
season. It was of blue just cloth, the satin
striped panels of the skirt being divided by
full pleating* of chiffon. The elbow sleeves
were very full and the deep yoke was a lat
tice arrangement of chiffon folds, i A shower
of lilies of the valley and blue tulle finished
this very artistic and girlish costume. Mrs.
Black's gown of pink flowered organdie was
a very modish affair also, and her mother,
Mrs. W. Z. King of San Francisco, : wore t a
handsome creation of violet chiffon broadcloth.
Mrs. Joe Kelly, In a copper colored satin, was
one ;of the attractively gowned women, -, and
Mrs. Shelby Martin was even . more charming
than usual In a frock | of black organdie cov
ered with great pink roses, made in the pre
vailing full effect. Mrs. : K. J. Cotton was a
striking tjgure in a smart gown of brown lib
erty aatin. Mrs. Gannon's violet silk and the
dainty spring costume worn by Mrs. , gkhrock
were both noticeably pretty. One of the most
stunning gowns was worn by Miss Igoe of San
Francisco, the petite sister of the well-known
artist of that name. | It was of j blue French
novelty cloth, made with pleated , skirt and
short Jacket and a blue plumed hat, turned up
on one side, completed a very fetching outfit.
Among others who wore Â handsome gowns
were Mrs. George deGolia, Mrs. W. .S. Pal

DEATH FOLLOWS
RUNAWAY RIDE
Contractor of Berkeley Suc
cumbs to Injuries Sus
tained Wliile Out Driving
DIES IN GREAT AGONY
Hurts at First Were Thought
to Be Not Serious, but
Demise Eusues Quickly
â¢
BERKELEY, April 25.â Robert J.
Carter, a prominent contractor of
Berkeley, residing at 2401 Blake street,
was thrown by a runaway horse from
his cart last night, while driving a
spirited colt into Oakland, and received
injuries which proved fatal. He died
in great agony at his home this morn
ing.
Carter's hurts were not thought to
be serious when physicians examined
him last night at the Receiving Hos
pital in Oakland. His left shoulder
bone and two ribs were found to be
broken, but there were no injuries ap
parent that might cause death.
The contractor is supposed to have
been hurt internally, as he was drag
ged a distance of several hundred
feet by his frightened horse, which be
came unmanageable as Carter passed
Grove and Forty-ninth streets. He was
removed from the hospital in Oakland
to his home last night and this morn
ing complained of terrible pains, ex
piring a few hours after daylight.
Besides a widow, the contractor
leaves three children and a sister, Mrs.
J. German of Berkeley. He was 50
years old, a native of Ireland, and one
of the best known builders in Berke
ley.
NEW BLUECOATS
IN DEPARTMENT
BERKELEY, April 25.â The first
steps that are intended to lead to the
creation of a police department for
Berkeley, which shall resemble in some
respects at least a metropolitan force,
were taken by the Board of Trustees
last night, when six new deputy mar
shals were appointed. These men will
go on duty May 1, and each is to re
ceive a salary of $70 a month. Their
names are: J. F. Farrar, John Le
strange, Henry E. Jameson, Alonzo R.
Bush, W. E. Acheson, J. W Virgin. In
addition to these men the appointment
of Levi Moran by Marshal Gus Voll
mer, at a salary of $75 a month, was
approved by the trustees.
These new deputies are to be uni
formed at their own expense. The
addition to the police department is
expected to be permanent. Marshal
Vollmer will station a man in his office
to remain on duty throughout the
night, and the deputies detailed for
night duty will report at regular inter
vals throughout the night.
Marshal Vollmer will have the uni
form of a chief of police, and when he
appears in regulation blue and gold
habiliments the university town will
have, for the first time, a uniformed
police department.
Marshal Vollmer asked for twelve
new deputies, believing that this num
ber is required to properly police the
town, but the trustees declared that
the town's finances permit of employ
ing only six.

ALICE MASON SUES OUT
HABEAS CORPUS WRIT
Hold =Up Suspect Seeks Freedom
YOUNG WOMAN' WHO IS BELJEVED TO KNOW SOMETHING CONCERNING
CONCERNING THE IDENTITY OF THE MEN WHO WERE ATTEMPTING TO
ROB BRI'TTS SALOON WHEN THOMAS REILLY WAS KILLED.
Alice Mason, who was arrested by
Detective Ryan for alleged complicity
in the hold-up of the saloon of John
C. Brutt at Second and Brannan
streets last Friday night, has applied
to the courts for a writ of habeas
corpus. The woman was arrested, to
gether with George Hunter, who had
been in various criminal escapades.
Judge Cook issued a citation to Chief
Dinan to produce her in court this
morning that she may state her case.
Hunter and the other suspects re
main in jail and the police are still
searching for a woman known as Ida
Wilson, who is said to be very friendly
with Hunter. Captain of Detectives
Burnett still refuses to tell what evi
dence he has secured against Hunter
and the two women. He says he will
not release them, but the only expla
nation he will make is that he i 6
awaiting further developments.
Detective Ryan insists that he has
secured no new evidence against the
other two suspects, Ridell and Skurs.
the latter being the man who attempt
ed to hold up a brother-in-law of the
murdered man, Riley, about one week
before the shooting in the saloon.
An inquest was held yesterday by
Coroner Leland, but nothing new de
veloped. The jury returned a verdict
that Thomas Riley came to his death
on April 22 from a gunshot wound in
the right breast inflicted by a person
or persons unknown xo the Jury. None
of the witnesses were able to identify
any of the suspects.

MANIA FOR FAST RIDES
Joneph Byrne Admits That He Sent

Driving horses at a furious speed

where the ambulance is stationed.
! PolicemaTi Ziener was secreted yester
, day in the room where the telephone
I vac kept, and during the afternoon he

TRAINING THE MAX
BEHIND THE GUN
The Owl Drug Company Adopts New
Methods for Giving Better
Service.
Proof iÂ« at handâ lf proof were needed of
the progresalveness and go ahead spirit which
pervartei the Owl Drug Company in determina
tion to give the people of California the very
best drug store service in the world.
Mr. Arthui Sheldon, the famous business
building expert of Chicago, who has been giv
ing many instructive talks to business men
during his visit here was secured by the Owl
Drug Company to talk to their employes.
The retail xtorts In San Francisco and also
In Oakland were closed Monday night and
about 100 salesmen sat down to supper at the
Red Lion Grill. Representatives of the Los
Angeles and Sacramento stores were also pres
ent. Mr. Sheldon gave a most stirring and
Instructive talk, which was greatly enjoyed by
all who heard it.
The management of the Owl Drug Company
are so thoroughly Impressed with the Importancei
of training its clerks along the lines indicated
by Mr. Sheldon that they have arranged for
fifty of their employes to make a special study
of the principles of scientific salesmanship un
der Mr. Sheldon's guidance.
It is th* public of San Francisco, Oakland.
Los Angeles and Sacramento which will reap
the benefit of these up-to-date methods. Bet
ter service, greater skill, more courteous at
tention, a keener interest in a customer's
needs and welfare and a greater appreciation
of the importance of Intelligent service will
make tracing at any of the Owl Drug stores
a greater pleasure than ever before and the
management are to be congratulated upon their
progressive up-to-datenecs.

"Ramona," to Be Played for
Benefit of Old Missions,
Promises a Big Success
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
Bells of thÂ« past, whose long -forgotten muslo
Stiil fills the wide expanse,
Tingling the sombre twiugat of the present
With color of romance.
> â¢ â¢ â  â¢
I hear your call, and see the sun descending
On rock, and wave, and sand,
As down the coast the mission voices blending
Girdle the heathen land.
Thus sang Bret Harte of the bells
of- Mission Dolores â the bells that
rang out the Angelus at morn and at
eventide with never a miss for a cen
tury, guiding the affairs of the pueblo
with easy regularity.
Now they are still, but with a voice
less eloquence they appeal to every
heart that beats true to the traditions
of the West.
That the mission bells â the missions
themselves â appeal to the patriotism
of the people is apparent when a direct
appeal is made for their care and
restoration.
Since the facts were made public
yesterday that Virginia Calhoun and
her company will present her drama
tization of "Kamona" at the Alhambra
for the saving of old San Antonio Mis
sion and the providing of caretakers
at Mission Dolores, scores of good
people have come to the front to help
â and they came with a will that was
good to see.
As to "Ramona," the play is said by
The Wise Ones to be one of the pret
tiest pastoral plays ever put on the
boards of San Francisco, telling in
simple, natural fashion the beautiful
tale of Helen Hunt Jackson's â the
purest love story of its time.
The presentation Is coherent and
harmonious and breathing in every
line the atmosphere of the days of
old, when California was in truth a
land of milk and honey. â  And writ
throughout the story is the tragedy
that followed upon the heels of the
secularization of the missions, when
the Indian â for whom and by whom
the missions were reared in the wilder
ness â was shamelessly turned adrift
and his lands were snatched from him,
the desert alone offering him its dun
bosom for his weary head.
These things are true, unhappily
true. Helen Hunt Jackson builded her
story upon these facts^ â not individual,
to be sure, but collective.
And in Miss Calhoun's play is this
tale unfolded with scenic effects and
historic properties that bear out the
conceptions.
Even the little altar that stands in
the room of Ramona is cut from a
cross that once stood in the old Plaza
Church in Los Angeles.
Not the least important of the play
to be presented in behalf of old San
Antonio Mission, is the music therein
â Indian music by Arthur Farwell, he
whose weird and exquisite melodies
many of us heard some months ago.
This music has been lured from the
lips of aged Indians â through cajolery,
or the potency of a coin â and been re
corded in fhe phonograph. With In
finite care Mr. Farwell has arranged
it and it will be heard in a fit setting
in "Ramona."
Now here are some facts to be driven
home in your minds â in yours, in your
neighbors' â if you be good Californians:
Miss Calhoun's company will present
"Ramona," the California pastoral
play, including Arthur Farwell's ex
quisite Indian melodies, for the pur
pose of completing the restoration of
Mission San Antonio de Padua, now
well under way by the Landmarks
League; also to create a fund for the
maintenance of a caretaker at Mis
sion Dolores, that the old sanctuary
may be open to the people for all
time; andâ why not hope highâ if there
be funds enough left, to safeguard the
beautiful old Mission San Juan Bau
tista, near Sargents, San Benito
County.
Here the east church wall is threat
ened with fallingâ in spite of the piti
ful care bestowed upon it by its aged
custodian, old Father Closa, he who
for fifty years has labored alone in the
old cloister.
The dates of the benefit performances
are Friday evening, May 5, Saturday,
May 6, matineÂ« and evening perform
ances, prices to be determined later.
The Alhambra, remember.
The list of patronsâ isn't It time we
dropped the antiquated word "patron
ess?" â will be issued in a day or two,
and will include a small army of lead
ing men and women, those who truly
love their State and all that pertains
to it.
FAMOUS DUBLIN BREWERS
HERE ON PLEASURE TRIP
B. S. and Robert Guinness Return
From a Hunt With Lord Beres
ford In Old Mexico.
B. S. Guinness and his brother, Rob
ert D. Guinness, members of the
world-famous Dublin family, arrived
in this city yesterday and are regis
tered at the St. Francis. The visitors
came to this country several months
ago with Lord Charles Beresfotd, vice
admiral of the British navy, and in
company with Bourke Cockran of New
York proceeded south to Mexico,
where they were the guests of Presi
dent Diaz and other prominent offi
cials of the southern republic, who af
forded the admiral and his traveling
companions every facility for enjoying
a tour through the wilds of Mexico,
where they enjoyed a hunt for biff
game. Discussing his trip last night,
Robert Guinness said:
Lord Beresford and my brother and myself
have enjoyed our American visit immensely
and would have prolonged It several weeks if
duties at home had not compelled Lord Beres
lord to return to England. He remarked
bffore -we parted that he would have been
greatly pleased to come to California, where
he has many friends, but the fact that he Is
due In England the latter part of May, when
JÂ«= is to assume command of his fleet, made
it necessary for him to abandon a trip to
the Western States. My brother and myself
are undecided how long we will remain here,
but it is very likely that our stay will be sev
eral weeks. Bourke Cockran expected to Join
us In San Francisco, but he may change his
plans.
Pleads for Fugitive.
William Finley, 20 years of age. an
escape from Whittier Reform School,
was arrested by the local police Mon
day evening. The boy was sent from
San Jose to serve a term of nine
mpnths for battery. He had been jn
many quarrels in the Garden City and
was regarded as incorrigible. Seven
days after he entered the reformatory
he made his escape. He immediately
came to this city, where he secured
employment and for the last eight
months has worked steadily and
avoided all trouble, as testified to by
his employer. An effort will be made
to permit the youth to continue at his
â work and to have the sentenpe to the
reform school revoked

SUCCESS LIES
IN HARD WORK
Herbert E. Law, one of San Fran
cisco's wealthiest business men, ad
dressed a large throng of members of
the Young Men's Christian Association
last night, his subject being: "A Prac
tical Business Man to Young Men."
Mr. Law gave one of the most inter
esting and instructive talks that has
been delivered from a rostrum in this
city for some time. He was introduced
by Secretary McCoy and said in part:
Men who have gained position in the world
are working just as hard as when they were
boys. Most of the successful ones are not
college men. but men who taught themselves.
The measure of success does not rest on mere
opportunity, nor wealth, nor understanding,
but on the ability to use these agencies. Only
that which you use la of value to you. You
will hear of lots of things that you will
never use.
Men can do what they will. The power
in man to do a thing is almost unlimited.
The fact that you have not a college educa
tion is no bar to success. I have been
criticized for saying a boy is better off with
out a college education. If he is rich and
expects to live a life of ease he is better with
it but if he has to make his own way and
you keeu him along in college until be rs
27 or 28 and then turn him loose with only
an office boy's knowledge he is handicapped.
I want to begin when I am 14 and learn
all the preliminaries while I am young and
not line up at a later age against a boy
fifteen years my junior with only the knowl
edge of business he possesses.
Some of you young men who are listening
to me will be great men and millionaires.
Your success will not be a matter of chance,
but of work. The whole question is. are you
willing to work? The key to success is labor
â persistent labor. There is nothing withtn.
reason you cannot accomplish If you make
up your mind to accomplish it. Stay with it.
Don't think the men who make successes are
geniuses born. They are not. They work
until they feel almost worn out. but they rest
and the sun comes out and they get break
fast and go at it again. They make everj
succeeding blow stronger and more effective
than the one of yesterday and then they suc
ceed.
OPPORTUNITIES PIjEXTY.
There are plenty of opportunities. The
hardest thing in our business is to find a
man who can earn $10,000 a year. We are
looking for them. We examine every man
in our own employ and every man our neigh
bor lias. Napoleon said he would rather have
a half-trained army of enthusiasts than a
perfect machine. That's part true with us.
We want the man you can't shake off, who
will come back again and again.
Never go away with the Idea, you can't
do a thing. A man must have confidence.
You don't know half what's In you. In our
business we uÂ»ed to go to college and get
the most persistent boys we could find. Do
you know the first boy we would go to?
The janitor. It takes a lot of courage and
iiluck to get through college by being a jan
itor That Is the real badge of courage.
These boye who acted as janitors were always
leaders They did not drink nor carouse.
WÂ» had nothing to do with that crowd. We
wanted the men we knew were willing to
work and do their duty. I^ts of men who
are worth millions got there with no other
qualification than ability to work hard.
You musn't get discouraged at obstacle*.

THE TREASURY DEFICIT.
npHH revenues of the Government have two main sources, the
tariff and internal revenue tax. These ebb and flow with the
* varying rate of consumption by the country of imported goods
I liquors and tobacco. With no apparent reason why it should
so. there occur periods of excessive consumption, producing a
plus in the treasury, followed by a reaction, and economizing of
sumption, that cause a Treasury deficit.
In Mr. Cleveland's first term there was present a large surplus,
ich excited hi? anxiety and caused a demand for the reduction
ariff taxation. When his second term began the reaction was in
Full taring and a growing deficit appeared and remained as a tor
ment to die end of the administration. To meet it, the large sum
S26o.ocki.cxx) was borrowed on bonds. The situation then de
veloped into a panic that was caused by the unsatisfactory condition
of our financial policy. The Treasury was receiving a large incre
ment ot depreciated silver, which excited the fear that we would
slip to a silver basis. This also weakened the credit and impaired
the borrowing power of the Government. Tbe depression continued
until the election of 1896 made it certain that the gold standard
would be fortified bj' law.
Then followed a rise in consumption and an increase in the
revenue* that had a long stay. Xow there is the inevitable reaction.
The immediate expenses of the Spanish war were met by an increase
in internal revenue taxation, so that no impression was made upon
the ordinary income. But it seems to be apparent now that the pro
ed effect of that war upon national expenses was not taken into
â¢ sidt- ration when the war taxes were repealed. That brief expe
nce revealed certain changes in our national policy. We expanded
- domain in directions that will not for a long time participate in
replenishing the Treasury. A large increase in our navy became a
pressing national necessity. The people wanted the isthmian canal 4
and demanded its acquisition and construction by the Government.
Looking backward only a little way it is easily seen that all
tlu-se consei .-ences of the war and making the canal a national work
ant an increase in expenditures that could be met only by in
;ised taxation. It is as if a man double his estate by extension
â¢ â¢ â¢ perties at present non-productive, and attempt to maintain
whole upon a revenue that barely sufficed for his original hold
:. The war taxes were repealed too soon. They were as legitimate
the purposes entailed by the war as they were for its current
tf. They were as legitimate if applied to the cost of the navy
made neces.-ary by the war as they were for the cost of its actions
Manila and Santiago. But this was not taken into account, and
â¢he repeal of the war taxes we owe the existing and increasing
:oit in the Treasury.
\\"hile it should not be treated with complacency or indifference,
is by no means a reason for alarm. In 1893 our financial policy
tied public and private credit together. They were financial Siamese
as. If Eng died Chang died also. If the increment of silver
-bed the Treasury upon a silver basis and rested the public
Credit upon 50 cent dollars, all private credits outstanding that were
n<u covenanted in a special contract shrank one-half also. It was
that element in the situation twelve years ago that caused the panic.
When the Treasury ran low and neared the point of suspension of
:nent. it meant a final slump to the silver standard. That was
the peril met with high courage by Mr. Cleveland in a way that
.- fame permanent in his country's history. Such peril is not
\ present. Public and private credit are entirely separated, as
should be If a panic come at any time in the future. A c it
mfey. it will rise in the effect of overspeculation upon private credit,
ndition of the Treasury will have no connection with it
at all.
The country is flush with money. Great constructive enterprises
readily underwritten. Foreign loans, like that of Japan, placed
here, are immediately oversubscribed. The deficit in the Treasury
causes no alarm, and is a subject of anxiety to the administration
\. It it continue, the proper course will be an increase in taxa
â¢.. The people are familiar with that experience in their State
I local governments. They are less familiar with it in the national
government, because national taxation is indirect.
The people demanded the Spanish war. and upon direct appeal
have three times indorsed all of its results. The Call can speak
n an entirely disinterested standpoint, since it strove against
c of tho>e results, while the question was open. But it is open
jer. and the condition of the public revenues, expressed by
â¢ cit. must be taken as evidence that complete adjustment to
new conditions has not been effected. The lesson is obvious. What
â pie wanted they have. The larger estate is here, probated to
m by the war which they demanded. They must patiently assist
in â  stment made necessary by the expansion of responsibility.
THE WESTERN PACIFIC.
THE project for a new line of railway to come overland and enter '
California by the Beckwith Pass was long in the air. Then it
came down to the ground and secured terminal facilities in
Stockton and Oakland, and certain rights of way. But still it '
remained a mystery in respect to its backing. Now the whole 1
project is revealed as a certainty, with the Gould "nterests openly
bricking it. The bonds for construction have been placed and the. i
c work will be speedily under way.
A new transcontinental road is naturally a matter of great in
terest to California, and there is in this a novelty that will excite I
Â° the keenest expectations. It promises to provide a line, all under !
one management and ownership, from the tidewater of one ocean :
to that of the other. The Atlantic terminus is said to be located at '
Baltimore, and the natural name of the road, "The Oakland and Balti- J
more," is suggestive of great things. The new line will be welcome, I
as a new facility for our commerce, traversing new territory, stimu- j
lating new production and penetrating regions to which the trade of j
San Francisco may flow. In a larger respect the new road is an oh- I
ject lesson. Its construction proves that railroad builders and the !
bankers who furnish the capital do not fear that overland roads will
consist merely of the right of way and two streaks of rust after the j
Panama canal is built. They rightly regard the canal as a factor in a
future development of this west coast that will so greatly increase
the business of the transcontinental railways that more lines must |
be built to carry our commerce.
The canal has been a sort of spook to some railway men, who
were in the habit of turning pale whenever it was mentioned. But
the building of the Oakland and Baltimore line banishes the ghost of
the waterway, and proves that it was an invented bogy and not the
real thing. The Gould interests are strong enough to make a first
class line, and their experience in opening new country by supplying
new facilities may be trusted to make this road a factor in the de
velopment of all the productive territory it will traverse.

BACHELOR GIRLS OF
THE TWENTIETH
CENTURY.
As far as appearance goes, the bach
elor girl who prevails at the present
time would delude the unwary into
thinking that she was of the old school,
says a writer in the London Telegraph.
She shuns eccentricities of dress, the
unbecoming masculine lines at the one
extreme, as carefully aa the rough-pot
and high heels at the other. Her
clothes are only a little simpler than
those of her sister in society. She does
not swear or smoke cigars â although
she reserves the right to do so If she
wishes. Her manners are rimple and
direct.
The social settlements have been a
â¢boon to girls of this class. They form
stepping-stones between college and
Bohemia. Allied to this sort of inter
est are other movements, in which
bachelor girls of sentiment and educa
tion may become twentieth-century
ministering angels. One of these is
the great system of organizing chari
ties employing tens of thousands of
trained nurses and a third the promo
ters of economics and municipal re
forms.
Literary and artisttc bachelor girls â
\\ riters, sculptors, illustrators, paint
ers and the like â also hold their devo
tion to Ideals responsible for their
manner of living. They are found in
places as closely resembling those of
the Paris Latin Quarter as brand-new
America can furnish.
Similarly, women doctors, lawyers
and architects and all sorts of pro
fessionals do their work as their
brothers do. asking no favors and
planning independent lives in estab
lishments of their own.
BOBBIE ON MAYORS.
Mayors is men that runs the city the
right way befoar elecshun, and the way
thay please after elecshun. when thay
go out to make a speach in the cam
paign thay say Well, my deer people, if
I am elected to this onorable offis I shal
do all in my power to uphoald the
morals of our community and make
this city 2nd to none In the whole
wurld. Thay also say, Whatever else
I do, I shal make the all nite saloons
close up and stop the slot masheens
and the dance halls.
then after elecshun thay talk a littel
rest befoar beginning to close the tuff
places, and while thay are talking a
rest the men which own the tuff places
git together and call on the Mayors and
say If you doant be good we will chase
you to the woods and yure nairn will
be mud. Then the Mayors' doant know
what to do so thay doant do it.
We have about the nisest Mayor of
them all. When he starts out to be
elected again he jest tells the peeple
Woll, how do you like my beautiful
city, isent it a hot old town and doant
you have a good time nites when you
are through with yure work, you bet
you do. Vote for me again and I guess
you will always be abel to git what
you want for yure munny. Then the
peeple vote for him and he goes back
to the mine and says I toald you so.
I wudent cair to be a Mayor, there is
too many peeple asking Jou for a Job,
and U thay doant all gft a Job thay
vote for another Mayor the next time
and then you are licked, and you can't
git a Job yourself if you have been a
Mayor unless you keep it dark. â Mil
waukee Sentinel.
TOO LITTLE READING.
According to our observation, says
the Century, there is vastly too little
reading done, rather than too much;
and we think it fortunate that Presi
dent Roosevelt's example has been set
forth as an illustration of what can be
accomplished, in the most occupied of
lives, to broaden the intellectual out
look. His example will serve every
where as a stimulus. And the Blow
reader should not be discouraged, but
encouraged rather, for if he really
has the "disposition" to read, the
year's end. under whatever difficulties,
will give him, also, a list of readings
accomplished which will shame the in
different and vastly increase his own
intellectual wealth. Reading for the
relief of troubled thoughts, as a mere
sedative, is immeasurably valuable, ac
many an overwrought brain has found,
and so is reading for the highest forma
of pleasure, for healthy enjoyment as
well as for desired information, for
new outlooks, for the broadening of
sympathies and the correction of nar
row views, for culture â above all, for
inspiration.

NAVIGATING THE AIR.
To the Editor of The Call:
If I had the money necessary for
the practical demonstration of my
idea V could, I think, solve the prob
lem of aerial navigation in the man
ner herein set forth:
I would have built, according with
the latest designs of gas engines, one
of enormous power with the least pos
sible weight. That I would accom
plish by having it made as a shotgun
barrel Is made, by winding threads of
the best steel around a core ajt right
angles to the length of the cylinder.
In this manner I would get the maxi
mum of power with the minimum of
weight.
I would have constructed a steel
boat, very narrow, and with most of
its weight at ..he bottom. At the bot
tom I would place the engine. Ex
tending below the boat there would be
a false keel, several feet in extent,
through which would extend the
mechanism that would work the pro
peller. My idea is to have, for ex
perimental purposes a boat say twenty
feet long that would draw five feet of
water and would have her propeller at
starting ten feet below the surface.
Above the boat, say seven feet, I
would have the aeroplanes, solid but
mobile, slightly curved downward and
slightly tilted upward in front. Each
(of the two) would be about thirty
feet long and five feet wide.
My idea is that as the boat neared
the maximum of speed possible with
the driving power the slightly inclined
aeroplanes would elevate the boat
(acting as a kite acts) and would

thereby decrease the resistance of the
water, and consequently there would
be greater speed attained with the
same expenditure of power. As the
speed Increased the holding power of
the aeroplanes on the atmosphere
would become greater, and, in conse
quence, a further elevation of the boat
and a lessening of the resistance of
the water. Should the boat be lifted
almost out of the water, or, indeed,
actually clear of it, the experimenter
would have the only feasible method
of studying how to control his aero
planes.
Assuming that the true keel of the
boat rose above the surface of the
water, the propeller would still be five
feet below it, and by lessening the up
ward inclination of the aeroplanes the
engineer could easily immerse his real
keel to any desired extent. A little
practice at this would enable him to
sink his craft to the gunwales, or float
In on top of the water, at will. Having
achieved that much he could make
more actual discoveries in a week than
all the mathematicians could deduce
in a decade.
That the aeroplane as the true prin
ciple underlying the problem of aerial
flight has long been accepted is known
to everybody who reads of the scien
tists and their work, but the successful
application of the well-known prin
ciple remains for a man of the future.

surprised at anything; he had to put

"Where am I at?" he exclaimed as
soon as he recovered his breath suf
ficiently to use it in articulating. No
response being made to this inquiry,
he proceeded to look around for a
button to press.
"By gravy," he said to himself, as
he slipped shivering about in the pale
pink gloom hunting the missing but
ton, "this must be a flat and the Jan
itor is economizing on steam."
"Button, button, where's the but
ton?" he cried presently, and none be
ing at hand, he began to kick, for Jo
nah was a natural born kicker. If he
had not been he would have been else
where. About the seventh time his
foot hit the wall where he thought the
door ought to be â seven being a lucky
number â a voice, smothered and in

"No I haven't, nor no telephone

"How in thunder am I going to

"What do you want?"
"Can you send me up a cocktail?

"No, can't send up anything;."
"Send it down then."

"No."
"It's easy enough getting; down, as

"Oh, I'll attend to that." and Jonah
could hear a gurgling somewhere on
the floor above him apparently.

"Fish."
"This ain't Friday, Is it?"
"No."
"Then I want something else."
"Well, look around and see if you

Supervisors' Aid for Telegraph Hill
Project Gives New Confidence.
(JURYING OF BONDS IS PREDICTED
The members of the California Club
â utdoor Art League and other
.adies who have been striving to have
a public park made of Telegraph Hill
fhat the historic eminence may be pre-
I and become an ornament, are
â¢ d with the action of the Super
- in taking steps toward the pur-
Of enough land on the slope of
the hill to protect it until the pr- ;
<j issue bonds for its beautifica
jan be placed before the voters
again this fall.
The ladies have not relaxed their
efforts a particle since the narrow de
feat of the first proposition to issue
bonds for the acquisition and adorn
ment of the hill. The action of the
Supervisors In opening the way for the
expenditure of $26,000 on the project
of redeeming the hill Is their first real
victoryâ be followed by the voting
of the bonds when the matter is again
AUkCed before the public, they say.
The ladies who have been foremost
In the fight have received many con
gratulations from the public spirited
citizens for their success before the
Supervisors. While the amount ap
propriated Is not large, the initial
acquirement of property that it will
make possible means a great deal to
the entire project, as the land at Chest
nut and Kearny streets, which this |
money will buy. Is something of a key
to the situation. Its purchase will be
such an important start-in the plan of
acquirement and beautlfication that It
will win many votes for the new bond
proposition when it is put before the
people- Speaking of the matter, Mrs.
Lovell White said: O
' WIVMVG ADHERENTS.
When the proposition to iesue bonds for the
acquirement and be-autiflratii n of the hill was
before the people we Mai right out among the
voters and made a fight for it. The small
margin by which It was beaten shows that
there is no particular objection to the project.
and when it is put before the people again it
will carry by a large majority, I am sure, be
cause 4. the Increased prominence It now has.
The more the people become familiar with it
the more popular it becomes.
We are going out among the voters again
when the matter is once mart before them.
"\>'e were surprised the last time to find how
many new voters there were who did not
know the hill by name. They knew it by lo
â¢ation. though, and wben told what it was
dtsired to do with it promised their support.
These will all be better educated when the
Chatter ie put to a vote again.
. The action at the Supervisor* in taking a
#tcp toward providing the $25,000 Is very en
couraging and pleasing. The appropriation of
%Ms money will nave the historic eminence
from vandalism until the bonds can be voted.
ThÂ»iÂ« is scarce*}- any one who loves this city
who does not feel that the hill should be pre
eerved and beautified, and there Is widespread
rejrret that the bonds failed to carry when
voted on.
Miss Catherine Hlttell said:
We are using our strongest efforts to pre
serve the north face of the hill until the mat
ter of issuing bonds can be voted on again.
Every person who loves 6an Francisco is In
terested in the preservation of Telegraph Hill
and the plans of the California Club and Out
door Art League concerning it. There could
not be a more beautiful driveway in the city
than the winding one it is proposed to con
struct to the top of this hill when It becomes
a park. To the north will be TamaJpals and
the Golden Gate with the ceaseless stream of
Pacific commerce sweeping in and out""bf it.
Below will be the panorama of the busy city â
the life of ie streets and the curl of the fac
. Tory rmoke. " â  j
FOR THE TOrmsTS EYE.
Xot only for its historic value should Tele
graph Hill be presÂ«erved and adorned, but be
came we would have the etracyfer's first gsÂ«ze
when he comes in sight of our city rest upon
something beautiful, as the eye of the tourist
firet falls upon the Edlnboro hills, the hills of
Naples or Riverside Park. New York.
The action of the Supervisors will arouse a
greater interest among those we want inter
ested. It will show that the project is as live
as ever and that the ladles are determined to
carry It out successfully. I can't see where
many votes against the bonds are coming from
after the plan has been given so much promi
nence and the advantages of the hill's beau
tiflcaton to thÂ« people have been so clearly
shown.
Mrs. M. J. Gorham, another of the
Telegraph Hill park advocates and a
hard worker for the bonds, expressed,
with Mrs. White, her gratification at
th<=- action of the Supervisors and her
belief that the bonds would surely
v. hen placed before the voters
again. With the others Mrs. Gorham

MORE ARGUMENT
IN CLUNIE CASE
Judge Garoutte Makes Ee
ply to Attorney Delmas as
to the Trust Prorision
BUDD IS YET TO SPEAK
Diflicult Point in Probate
Law Being Threshed Out
by Eminent Legal Array
The great array of counsel for and
against the validity of tne trust of the
Clunie building under the will of the
! late Thomas J. Clunie, appeared
yesterday afternoon before Judge
Coffey for a third time in argu
ment of the legal questions raised
by the application for distribu
tion to the trustees to Garry out the
trust. The first plea was made on the
7th of this month by Timothy J. Ly
ons, who opened the case on behalf of
the brother, Andrew J. Clunie, against
the validity of the trust. A week
later Judge Hudson Grant and D. M.
| Delrnas had their turn in answering the
argument of Lyons, and then the mat
ter was continued until yesterday to al-
I low the other lawyers on Clunie'B side
i to reply to Delmas.
It was expected that both C. H. Ga
| routce, ex-Justice of the Supreme
', Court, and ex-Governor James H. Budd
would speak yesterday, but as Judge
Garoutte occupied nearly two hours
the argument could not be finished and
a further continuance was ordered un
til Thursday at 11 o'clock.
Judge Garoutte went into great de
tail yesterday in answering and dis
secting the propositions put forward
by Grant and Delmas why the trust
should be sustained. In opening his
discussion Judge Garoutte said that the
propositions advanced by .Lyons were
the obvious ones to any candid legal
mind, and yet no attempt was made to
answer them, he contended. Bo emi
nent a lawyer as r>elmas, he declared,
refused to meet them and endeavored
to pass them by with a wave of his
hand. But, said Judge Garoutte, no
lawyer, however great In his profes
sion, could, by a wave of the hand, es
cape the necessity of an answer to
propositions which by their statement
alone called for a reply, and he urged
upon the court the fact that attorneys
were ministers of justice and aids and
assistants to the Judge, and as such
they were called upon to respond to
arguments which naturally called for
an explanation.
OPPOSING COUNSEL DISAGREE.
Garoutte then took up the independ
ent propositions put forward by Grant
I and by Delmas at the rormer argu
; ment. He laid considerable stress up
on the fact that Grant and Delmas
differed fro^n each other as to the
"grounds upon which the trust should
be sustained- Delmas had in the pre
liminary argument, on April 7, claimed
! that the trust was valid on two
grounds, as trust to pay a portion of
the rents and profits to the adopted
son, "Jack" Clunie, and to accumu
late" the balance for his be: :.t until
he reached the age of twenty-five
years. Upon the second argument, on
â¢ April 14, Delmas retracted his former
contention and said that his associate,
Judge Grant, had In the interim fur
nished him with a "plausible" argu
ment to the effect that the surplus
income was not a trust for accumula
tion, but was to be used to manage and
improve the Clunie building. This re
traction of Delmas involved two
significant aspects, said Garoutte. It
showed that the other side had no
certain ground upon which to sustain
the trust, and also illustrated the cor
rectness of the argument made by his
colleague Lyons, that the trust scheme
of Thomas J. Clunie was one forbidden
by the law.
Garoutte then proceeded to enlarge
upon this latter point and Illustrated,
in various ways, the fact that by the
terms of the trust the trustees could
handle the Clunie building as they
pleased until the adopted son reached
the age of twenty-five years, and
argued that if such an arbitrary dis
cretion were allowed by the law\ the
logic of it would sanction a like un
restricted conduct for ninety-nine
years. No one could successfully con
tend, the attorney emphasized, that
property could be tied up for such an
indefinite time.
MIST BE IX EXPRESS TERMS.
That there is no duty of any kind
imposed upon the trustees, but that
everything was left to their discretion,
was gone into at length. Garoutte
cited Supreme Court cases to the point
that there can be no valid trust un
less the directions to the trustee in
express terms are imoerative and so
set forth that a court could enforce
them. In conclusion Judge Garoutte
argued that there was no direction to
pay or to apply any definite part of
the income of the Clunie building for
the adopted son and that the court had
already adjudged that other property
in the estate was given for the pur
pose of his support. The result was
that the whole trust was void, as op
posing counsel admitted that there was
no attempted "trust" to "accumulate"
the income for the adopted son.
At the conclusion of Judge Ga
routte's argument there was consider
able discussion between attorneys
Lyons and Delmas as to who should
have the right of closing the argu
ment. It was finally agreed that when
ex-Governor Budd should finish his
argument. Judge Grant and Delmas
should answer him for the alleged
trustees, and that Attorney Timothy
J. Lyons should be entitled to close
the argument in the case on behalf of
the brother, Andrew J. Clunie.
Should Judge Coffey declare the
trust void the adopted son will never
theless get a half interest in the
Clunie building, as he and the brother
are residuary legatees under the will
and as such are entitled under the
law to take whatever property Is not
validly disposed of.
MANUFACTURERS' JOURNAL
FOR BENEFIT OF COAST
Monthly Publication Dealing With the
Production and Marketing or
Commercial Output.
Recognizing the need of the manu
facturers of the coast, a monthly
magazine as an exponent of their In
terests has been started in San Fran
cisco. The proprietor and editor, L.
Walker, has long been connected with
various manufacturing: industries on
the coast and he means to discuss in
his journal the progress and develop
ments of manufactures that will be of
interest to producers.
This supplies a want, as the East
ern publications do not dwell strongly
enough on the Importance of Western
manufacturing and do not furnish
enough local manufacturing news.
The editor has great confidence in
the future of California and the West.
He says iron products can be made to
sell in New Tork, competing with
Eastern goods.
Judging from the first Issue the
Journal will be a success.

ADVICE GIVEN
BEET GROWERS
University Professor Author
of Bulletin Just Issued
at the State Institution
TO KILL CODLING MOTH
Expert Tells Horticulturists
How to Minimize In
juries to the Foliage
BERKELEY, April 26.â Bulletins
dealing respectively with the sugar
beet industry and the work of ridding
orchards of the codling moth were is
sued to-day by the agricultural de
partment of the State University. Pro
fessor G. W. Shaw is the author of the
sugar beet literature. He states that
the bulletin is issued to "meet a de
mand for somewhat detailed informa
tion upon the principles of sugar beet
culture, as practiced in the most suc
cessful beet-growing sections."
A summary of the bulletin's advice
to sugar beet growers is as follows:
It is generally considered that the highest
return of sugar per acre 1* given where the
mean summer temperature Is not far from 70
Jpfji <-<-â¢Â». and where the rainfall Is from 2 to 4
Inches per month during the growing period,
and where heavy rains do not occur during the
ripening period, the occurrence of such rains
at tne time indUated tending to lower the
sugrr-content ef the root.
While theee conditions have generally be<n
held up the tnonl ideal, ret the success in
America under conditions wrlch vary cons id
ably from those above indicated, especially as
to rainfall, .item to show that they must not
be regarded as being absolute, and that the
beet has a somewhat wider rei:ge of adaptabil
ity to climatic conditions than has been claimed
by European authorities; and that within cer
tain limits our idea* should be formeu" from
the conditions under*" which the industry has
met with succesa in tMs country.
Certain It is that drougtu must be avoided, I
nnd where frequent summer rains do not oc- |
cur, nor heavy logs and news, the soil must be
of such a nature as to retain free moisture In
liberal quantity, or the moisture must do '
supplied by irrigation, both of which conditions ,
hold en certain parts of the Pacific Coast, and I
the latter in Colorado, Utah and California.
Abundance of sunshine is also essential to the |
highest development of sugar in the beet. Other
things being equal, it may be nalci that the ;
richness of the beet will bt proportioned to the |
amount â net intensity â of thu sunshine.
Maxims for sugar beet culture are: Flow
in the fall. Prepare fine seedbed. Use plenty :
of seed. Plant shallow. Tnm early. Practice
flat cultivation. Keep tne surface always
lo<we. Hoe and cultivate as long as the leaves
r-iH permit. The sugar comes from the/ sun
and air; therefore keep the soil loose so the sun
and air can do their maximum work, and the ;
result will be both tonnage and sugar.
W. H. Volck's bulletin discusses the
problem of limiting the injury to fo
liage when spraying trees in an at
tempt to kill codling moths. In an in
troductory note, Professor Wood worth
says:
There were two chief problems presented for
solution tn the study of the coOUng moth in
the Pajaro Valley, rit. : ttrst, the frequent fail- ,
ure to obtain sufficient control; and second,
the very common seriuus injury to foliage by
the material used. The answer to the first is i
that there were too few applications and these j
not properly timed to secure the best results. I
This matter Is fully discussed in bulletin No. I
155. At the tim* of the publication of that |
bulletin the Fecond problem was not satlsfac- '
torlly an.Â«wered. During the PÂ«Â»t season and ;
the latter part of the preceding year Mr. Volck j
has b*en detailed to make a special study of j
thU subject, and while he is not yet ready to â¢
give his results In full, still sufficient progress
has been made to justify definite recommenda
tions for the coming season's work. WhJJa the
present circular Is wrlt'en particularly for the ,
conditions obtaining tn the Pajaro Valley, j
there Is much that may be useful to growers |
of apples and pejrrs In other sections where j
the danger from burning- the foliage is small, â¢
In which case paris green is the moat satisfac
tory spray lnz material.
A summary of the advice to orchard
lets in the bulletin is as follows:

FINAL REHEARSAL FX)R
MUSICAL FESTIVAL NEAR
Great Body of Children Will Give Ac-
count of Ttieir Vocal Ability
Saturday.
Those who will have the good for
tune to hear the final rehearsal of the
7500 children for the May Festival at
the Mechanics' Pavilion on Saturday
will have a great musical treat in ad
vance.
The entire body of the great chorus
will sing over the songs that are cer
tain to make a wide impression, judg
ing from the very excellent showing
the children have thus far made, as
a gigantic singing ensemble.
The children will sing on the Mon
day and Saturday afternoons, and for
these occasions the sale has been
heavy. "Americana" will be given on
Wednesday night and "Parsifal" on
Tuesday evening.
One big change in the Pavilion for
the festival consists of the construc
tion of an inclined stage for the chor
uses in the west end of the building.
The children's chorus will fill the
stage and besides will occupy both
sides of the gallery. The stand is to
be extended seven feet to accommo
date the band.

SEALS SWARM OVER THE HOME PLATE
Thirteen Runs the Re
sult of an Easy
Day's Work.
Oakland Plays Ball
That Savors of
the Bushes.
Oakland played as ragged a game of
ball on the home grounds at Idora
Park yesterday as any ball team ever
put up. The Seals had the contest
cinched in the third inning, when they
managed to get three runs right off the
reel without the aid of hits. After
that it was nothing but a procession,
Bcoreâ San Francisco 13, Oakland 6.
Graham was wild and did not seem
to care whether the Seals made a hun
dred ruas or one. He filled up the
bases in the third and then forced a j
run by walking Irwin. A bunch of er- j
ri rs followed and two runs were the I
result, and so a promising looking ;
gime was spoiled on the spot. Wheeler
rifid not try to pitch when his team
assumed such a good lead.
The Commuters got two men on the
liases after two had been stowed away
in the ninth inning and Kruger man
aged to swing: through with a long
tciple to deep left field, bringing them
both in. Dunleavy was up next and
he ended the game with a fly to right
â¢ garden.
When the game was lost in the sev
enth inning Van Haltren took Graham
off the slab and substituted Hogan, his
young bush league pitcher. The kid
was hit pretty hard in the ninth
Â£"}>asiii, but the runs were not so much
his fault as that of the fielders, who
failed to back him up. The youngster
has a nice, easy delivery and looks
like the making of a good pitcher.
Oakland was crippled by Kelly's ab-
nee. The star second baseman twist
ed his ankle while sliding into first
base on Sunday and will be out of the
game for several days. At first it was
thought his injury was slight, but it
turned out to be serious. The score:

JAP BASEBALL TEAM
ROUNDING INTO FORM
Little Brown Men Perform like Big
Leaguers After a Few Days'
Practice.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, ' April
25. â The Japanese team of ball toss
ers from Waseda University, who will
play Stanford's varsity nine next Sat
â¢ urday, seem to have entirely recov
ered from the effect* of their long
trip and have got down to scientific
ball -playing. When the much herald
ed team of brown men first arrived
on the cardinal grounds the crowd of
student fans were disappointed at
* their showing. Errors were frequent
* and throws were wild. But all this
seems to have been the natural result
of the long sea trip, for now the Jap
. fielders are scurrying over the ground
â¢ making the most sensational kinds of
- stops and throws. They begin the
daily practice at noon and work until
2 o'clock in the afternoon, going
through both batting and fielding
â¢work.
A. Kono, the diminutive Jap pitcher,
is a source of continual wonder to the
Stanford players. It seems strange
that a man with an arm that meas
ures only twenty-four inches in
length could attain great speed, but
Kono has accomplished this. He has
a shoulder ball that is likely to puzzle
the cardinal batsmen. Kono throws
curves, taught him by an American
graduate who is a professor in Japan.
The little brown men can hit
straight balls. Straight balls are all
that have been thrown at them so far,
and it is impossible to tell what they
will be able to do against the decep
tive curves. Shisheuchi, the right
fielder, is the premier hitter of the
team. At practice this morning he
got fourteen # hits out of twenty balls
that were thrown at him, and the
fielders robbed him several times at
that. The rest of the team connect
Fquarely, sending liners just over the
heads of the lnfielders.
Thp Japs will meet the cardinal nine
in a second game at Recreation Park,
Francisco, on Mayday.

Tigers Bunch Their Hits
When They Count
. Most.
Not a Giant Reaches
Third Till the Last
Round.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Ore., April 25.â The
Giants were taken into camp to-day
by the Tigers to the tune of 6 to 0.
Thomas and Garvin both pitched good
ball, but the bunching of hits on the
giant twlrler in two innings did the
business. What hitting there was was
hard and clean and gave joy to those
who enjoy seeing the leather clouted.
Till the fifth inning Garvin was as
much of a mystery to the Tigers as
Thomas was to the Giants. With Gra
ham away via. the Murphy route,
Thomas hit for two bases, Doyle flew
out to Van Buren and Garvin struck
out Sheehan, but Klopf refused to see
these wide out curves and he walked
the latter. Nordyke's single helped a
little, but when "Truck" Eagan hit
for two stations there was a general
clean up and three runs were regis
tered. Out of the thirty men who faced
Thomas, only one reached third base
and this did not happen until the
ninth inning. Up to this time not a
Giant had got farther along than the
initial sack.
Bert Jones took Garvin's place at
bat in the ninth. Thomas floated in a
slow one that Jones hit on the nose
for two bags. Murphy was already
down. Van Buren went out to Eagan,
McCreedie made his first hit in 23
times at bat and Jones went to third,
where he died when Schlafly flew out
to center. The score:
Portland â 1 Tioomi â

AMATEUR BOOTS
DECLARED OFF
Deputy Sheriffs Are Keady
to Arrest the Pugilists
and the Show Is Stopped
Thar* are tears from Morris Levy,
There are weeps from Albert Youn*;
Alex Ureggalns' grief Is causing
Complications In his lung-;
McÃonaid's left's enjoined,
There's a warrant on his rig-ht.
Don't you hear the sad announcer:
" 'Kough House' will not fight to-night."
Thtre are Sheriffs In the alley.
There are Sheriffs at the door,
And the goes are off this evening:
Chase yourselves and clear the floor.
In the morn the sun will glisten
And the day, it may be bright.
But there's woe along the South Side â
"Rough House" will not fight to-night.
The Hawthorne Athletic Club's
fights were indefinitely postponed last
night. A posee of deputy sheriffs
were lined up outside Woodward's Pa
vilion waiting a signal from Foreman
Andrews to rush in and arrest every
pair of contestants, the referee and all
the officials, should they enter the ring.
Al Young, guiding sport of the club,
threw up the sponge and ordered Terry
Murnane to declare the fistlfli exhibi
tions called off.
The doors of the pavilion were thrown
open and the multitude rushed in and
fought for the front seats. The gath
ering was silent as Mr. Murnane
climbed into the ring.
"Chentlemen," he said, "owing to a
misunderstanding the bouts will not be
pulled off this evening. All those who
have paid their money to get in can
get it back at the box office. Tank
ing youse for your kind attention and
so forthâ it's all offâ good night."
There were murmurings of disap
pointment as the multitude that as
sembled to see Rough House McDonald
in Delsarte exercises filed sadly from
the place. A gentleman with a pin-head
and a megaphone voice demanded a
speech from Foreman Andrews, but he
was assisted to the door by the po
lice.
Julius Kahn, attorney for the Haw
thorne Club and. It is reported, several
other "amateur clubs," worked hard
all day. He applied to Judge Hunt for
an Injunction to prevent the police
or deputy sheriffs from interrupting
the exhibition. The application was
refused, after District Attorney Bying
ton had been consulted. Byington an
nounced that no attempt would be
made to prevent people from entering
the place.
At a meeting of the Grand Jury,
Foreman Andrews made a report of
his Investigations of the Hawthorne
Club. He informed his fellow jurors
that the institution was owned and
controlled solely by Al Young, presi
dent of the club. The list of members,
he asserted, was a dummy list. The
jury instructed Foreman Andrews to
take such steps as he thought proper
to stop the contests. Mr. Andrews
held a consultation with the District
Attorney and secured the services of a
posse of deputy sheriffs.
Among the witnesses called by the
Grand Jury was Rough House McDon
ald, one of the star attractions that
might have been last ciight, "What
'ell, I dunno," was Mr. McDonald's in
formation to the jury.
Al Young, president of the Haw
thorne Club, did, not care to give "out
any statement last night. He claims
that the club Is legitimate in every
way.

EXCITING FINISH IN THE
HANDICAP.
SIX FAVORITES GO DOWN
Toto Gratiot Finishes Ahead
of High Class Field.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
One by onÂ« the public choices were
mowed down at Oakland yesterday,
until the mile handicap was reached,
when the talent made a final desperate
charge on the ring, hoping to even up
over the victory of High Chancellor.
Money by the cartload was pumped
into the books on the Bonsack entry
at even money, and McÃride on Gor
galette, a 10 and 15 to 1 shot, beat the
favorite out a neck.
Travers had the mount on the first
choice and It cannot be said that his
work bordered on the artistic, for a
rider of his capabilities. To begin with
he got the big horse away poorly and
then appeared to underestimate the
outsider^ jupply_of speed andstaying
qualities until too" late.
St. George Jr. ran third. Brlar
thorpe furnished the amusement, scor
ing a pronounced hit.
Travers had the mount on Danger
ous Girl, played down to favoritism in
the betting on the two-year-old event,
and the filly ran unplaced. Legal
Form, ridden by Lloyd Fountain, made
all the running and at the wire de
feated Arestellator with a trifle in re
serve. Tony Girl, a 25 to 1 shot, took
the show.
Robert Mitchell must be what is
termed a "sucker" horse in racing. He
looked a certainty for the six-furlong
purse run, and with Knapp in the sad
dle was plunged on at prohibitive odds,
Lily Golding outfooted the favorite to
the stretch, Knapp evidently thinking
he had something up his sleeve. Per
haps he did. At any rate Lily Golding
looked a winner at the paddock, when
Minder finished strong on the inside
with Sun Mark, a 10 to 1 shot, scoring
by a length.
As usual, Oscar Tolle was heralded
as a ripe one for the seven furlong
run, his price being hammered down
from 5 to 2^4 to 1 favoritism. He fin
ished fourth. Graham, astride My Sur
prise, quickly showed in the lead and
In a rattling drive at the close down
ed Marello by a head. Sweet Tooth,
after a tempestous voyage, run third.
In the betting on the five and a
half furlong sprint, with the weights
raised twelve pounds above the scale,
Royal White and Emma Reubold
closed equal choices in the betting.
Neither received a chalk mark. The
odds about Toto Gratto went from 7 to
10, and Minder landed the chestnut
horse first at the wire, two lengths in
advance of Revolt. Olympian led
Royal White out for third place.
Although Cotillion was returned a
winner of the mile and seventy yard

(t. W. Leathee. While Testify
in jr at Trial of Daughter's
Murderer. Displays Levity
MEETS WITH A REPROOF
Evidence Is Given by a Wit
ness Who Saw the Fatal
Shot Fired and by Others
The trial of Michael J. McCarthy on
a charge of murder for fatally shoot
ing his young wife, Octavia, at the
Judging-house at 1424 Market street, on
September 19, was resumed before a
jury in Judge Cook's court yesterday.
There were no sensational develop
mentÂ« as on the previous day. The
witnesses examined were Mrs. Ovlta
Hawes. sister-in-law of the defendant;
Harry Y. Yatata, a Japanese servant
at the lodging-house; Mrs. Helen S.
Robert*, a roomer there at the time of
the shooting; G. W. Leathee, father
in-law of the defendant; Mrs. Eliza
beth Sloath. mother-in-law of the de
fendant; Policeman John Mullen, who
arrested the defendant; Detective Ed
Gibson and Assistant District Attor
ney Louis Ferrari, who took Mrs. Mc-
Carthy's dying statement.
Mrs. Hawes. who is in the chorus
vith the Kolb and Dill Company, and
who was a prominent witness in the
Maude Amber divorce case, gave a
graphic description of the shooting,
She said she pleaded with McCarthy
0 shoot his wife and took the re
volver from him. After McCarthy
had dressed himself he asked the wit
ness for the revolver, and she made
him take an oath that he would not
carry out his threat. He took the
Â«ath and as soon as she gave him the
weapon he flred the shot at his wife.
Mrs. Roberts, who was in an adjoin
ing room and overheard all that hap
pened, corroborated Mrs. Hawes.
witness Leathee admitted that the
defendant choked his wife twice in his
presence and called her vile names.
At one time the witness laughed and
Assistant District Attorney Ashe said
severely: "This is no laughing mat
ter. It is a very serious matter." The
reproof had the desired effect. The
case for the prosecution will probably
close before the nocrr- adjournment to
day.

THE OIL CARRYING FLEET IS BUSY
Liquid Fuel Laden Vessels Constitute Most of Day's Arrivals
King Coal's successor, fuel oil, was
responsible for noarly all the activity
yesterday in the local shipping world.
The steamer Gypsy, the unyachtlike
freighter of the, Pacific Coast Steam
ship Company's fleet, long ago earned
the title of "Perpetual Motion." As
oil has wrested from his grasp King
Coal's scepter, so the oil carriers are
running the Gypsy a close race for her
strenuous Utle. The Gypsy rests only
while cargo is being loaded or dis
charged. Oil carriers are still only
under similar conditions and as the
loading and discharging of oil can be
carried on with greater rapidity than
any other kind of freight can be han
dled, the oil carriers' rests are shorter
than the industrious Gypsy's brief in
tervals of repose. The day is not far
off when the Gypsy must content her
self with being classed as "near per
petual motion."
The oil carrying steamer GeArge
Loomis arrived yesterday in ballast
from Redondo, where she had deliv
ered a cargo of liquid fuel. Then
cÂ«Â±me the steamer Atlas with the big
barge Xo. 93 in tow, both loaded with
oil from Port Harford. The steamer
Whit tier, also an oil carrier, with the
oil carrying barge Santa. Paula in tow,
arrived later from Port Harford with
fuel oil for up river. All of these oil
carriers will be at sea again to-day,
either carrying oil or in water ballast,
going for another cargo.
The steamer Argyll with the bark
entine Fullerton in tow arrived on
Monday from Honolulu, to which port
they had both carried large cargoes
of oil. They sailed again yesterday
for Monterey, where they will load
another cargo of oil for Honolulu. No
matter how long the run, the oil car
rier's stay in port is measured by the
length of time it takes to pump out
the liquid cargo and pump in the wa
ter ballast or vice versa, and the of
ficers and crew of an oil carrier soon
come to look upon land only as a
place where the end of a big-bellied
oil pipe rests. For all they see of
shore life they might as well be oc-,
cupying permanent positions on the
lightship, traveling back and forth
once every tide the length of her an
chor chain.
The tug Dauntless with the oil car

Compelled to Remove Wreck.
-^he Pacific Mai! Company for many years
used the hull of the old ship India for a store
house at Acapulco. Some time ago the India's
planks began to separate as the ancient.tim
bers lost their power to support the vessel's
frame and caulkinc no longer served to stop
the leaking. The hulk was abandoned and
to get her out of the way the Pacific Mall
people beached the India's remains. The Mexi
can Government protested against what they
declared was a menace to navigation and the
Pacific Mall Company was ordered to And an
other grave yard for the India. J. M. Ed
ward*, diver and expert wrecker arrived here
Monday on the liner Costa Rica and yester
day reported to the Pacific Mall Company that
he had blown up the India, scattered her de
caying boiiee over the ocean and that the
Mexican Government was satisfied with the
way the order for thÂ« wreck's removal had
been carried out.

Internal Revenue Commis
sioner Coming to Look Into
the Matter of Fortifying
MAY NOT USE RAISINS
Law Exempts Only the Pure
Article From Tax on Grape
Brandy Used in Product
United States Internal Revenue Com
missioner John W. Yerkes is expected
jto arrive in this city on May 1. His j
visit to California is authoritatively |
declared to be for the purpose of in
vestigating the methods of manufac
turing and fortifying sweet wines in
relation to the Internal revenue. Unit- j
/ ed States Internal Revenue Agent Bert
!M. Thomas discovered some months
I ago that during the heavy rains last
j fall many thousands of second crop
raisin grapes were spoiled on the trays
in the fields, and that these spoiled
raisins were utilized by the sweet
wine makers In the manufacture of
wines and the brandy with which they
I are fortified. The law allows grapa
| brandy to be manufactured for forti
j flcation purposes to the extent of twen
ty-four parts in 100 parts of wine free
of internal revenue tax. but it spe
| cifleally declares that such sweet wines
i must be made from the pure juice of
'â  fresh grapes, and the brandy must be
| made from such wines, but that raisins
j or dried grapes must not be used for
making either the brandy or the wine
under severe penalties. Mr. Thomas
reported what he had learned to the
' Commissioner at Washington. The Cal
ifornia Wine Association has made cer
tain representations in the matter
I which it is the intention of Commis
sioner Yerkes to inquire into. During
his stay in this State the Commissioner
) will make an exhaustive study ut the
i whole subject in order that justice may
i be done to the Government and to the
i winemakers.
The total amount of moneys with
i held at various times by former Dep
1 uty Internal Revenue Collector S. L.
Hogue of the Fresno district is $600.
As soon as the irregularity was dis
covered Mr. Hogue made good, but he
has been indicted by the Federal Grand
Jury in Los Angeles and will be tried
at the next term of the Federal court
in that city.
Collector Lynch says that the books
of hia office are in shipshape order.
Every year since he has been in the
office he has been complimented by the
, Commissioner for the excellent showing
: he has made.
The Commissioner baa recommended
to Congress that a tax be imposed upon
brandy used in fortifying sweet wines
! at the rate of 26 cents for each gallon
of brandy used.
BILLS OF THE COUNTY
HOSPITAL, WILL BK PAID
Supe^|[isors Arrange With Auditor to
Make Up an Apparent Overdraft
on Appropriation.
The Supervisors' Finance Commit
tee yesterday arrived at an under
standing with Auditor Baehr and
"Warden Fleming of the County Hos
pital whereby the bills for supplies of
the institution for January and Feb
ruary, which have been temporarily
held up. will be paid.
Auditor Baehr stated that U the
demands of January and February
were paid there would be an overdraft
of $6315 55. The total amount avail
able for the first nine months of th(
flscal year was $649 TO, against which
bills have been incurred for $690S 6:1,
making a deficit of $4065 62 on April
1. Baehr said that last year he had
allowed an overdraft of $3000 at the
instance of the Finance Committee
that had been subsequently made up.
The use of 4414 60 will be allowed out
of the salary account, leaving an ap
parent doflcit of $3600, which will be
made up in the next three months.
Warden Fleming said he never had a
doubt that the deficit could be easily
made up in view of the fact that the
expenses from now on will be less
than during the winter months. It
was decided to, draw further on the
salary account to pay the bills if nec
essary.

STOCKS â This Milwaukee defalcation, to
gether with the progress in the Equitable

Plttsburg reports. Indicating an approaching
over-production in steel and iron, with the
possibility of a Russian victory in. the com
ing naval battle, make the short side of stocks.
ecj<eclally on the hard spots, look attractive.
COTTON â The trading was mostly profes
sional. The bears Â«old quite freely in order
to bring out the long cotton, but were not
particularly successful. The weekly Govern
ment report at noon was considered bearish
by the room element. Wire trouble throughout
the belt occasioned by last night's storm
checked outside business to a great extent.
Admitting that the present crop is a large
one the present outlook does not signify by
any means another large yield if one takes
Into consideration the present backwardness
of thinrs.
Washington Government report â Cotton
planting has been active under favorable con
ditions over most of the cotton belt, but was
delayed by rain* in Oklahoma and Indian Ter
ritory. Arkansas ar.d Northern TexaÂ«. The
frost of the 17th killed the cotton in portions

New York Stock Market,
NEW YORK. April â The fright of spec
ulators in stocks ehowed evidence of subsidence
to-day, and. as was to be expected after thÂ«
violence of the recent downward plunge, there
was a recovery in the prices. It was to be
â¢expected also that the stocks which had led
the decline should be especially affected by
the demand from uncovered shorts, which con
stituted the principal factor in the recovery.
Union . Pacific. St. Paul and New York Cen
tral were the principal examples in the rail
road lift. In the industrial list an aggressive
tone was taken on the recovery in some of the
stocks which have offered comparatively good
resUtauce to the decline, notably in the metal
group. There was a very distinct falling off
in interest In the market, however, and traces
ol nervousness and feverishness were still very
perceptible. This was especially the case early
in the day before the relaxation of the sell
ing pressure from outside sources was clearly
perceived. London resumed operations after a
four-day Interval of idleness and took our
securities with such freedom as to make a
material aid In supporting the market. A
number of international stocks wÂ«nt between
1 and 2 points higher during the first I hour.
Besides the practical effect -of this buying
on other stocks, the tone of the London mar
ket dissipated any remaining tears of a criti
cal state of European policies. The weight
of the selling brought out by the opening
bulge In prices had a decidedly chilling effect
on Kentixnent and d. halting movement â¢ 10I
icwt J. An anxious eye was kÂ«pt on develop
ments growing out of the Milwaukee banking
scandal and there were some fears that still
lurtber losses would be Involved. More Im
portance was attached to the possible effect
of the episode In shaking the existing state
of confidence in the outstanding credits, which
is of importance to the present prosperous con
dition of the country. The day's events served
to quiet excitement to some extent regarding
the Milwaukee incident. The quieter tone of
the wt?*t market was also an effective' influ
ence in turning the stock market. With the
downward tendency arrested and the upward
turn established, less was heard of yester
day's rumors of hostilities In the railroad
world, which pointed to a degree- of bitterness
that had prompted a contest for control of
Union Pacific Itself. A notable feature of the
market en the recovery was the lessened
volume of activity, the total transactions for
the .Â£>â¢ falling considerably below those of
yesterday The speculation during the after
noon began to anticipate the action of the
meeting of directors of the United States Steel
Corporation which was to assemble later In
the cay and give out a statement of earnings
for the quarter. Expectations that this would
prove remarkable and record . figures were
talkeo of m the course of the late buying of
th* United Slates Steel stocks. . Other metal
stock* shared fully and even exceeded the
strenjrth Of the iron and steel issues, in spite
of the weakness of the market for crude cop
per. ' The advance ! In prices did not become
general for some time and was Interrupted by
a number of re-actions before it was estab
lished and carried to the jitrong closing. Call
loans were easier, but sterling exchange was

London account.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
- Future Grain and Provisions. â¢ ,
CHICAGO. April 25.â An altogether differ
ent feeling from that recently lin evidence j
existed In the wheat pit: to-day. The opinion
â was generally expressed - that the ; ' Gates line
of :- May wheat had btnn, entirely liquidated.
With me deal in May finally settled, attention
was . turned to July deWver*'. Rumors *oi.. a J
contemplated deal in that option -under the
guidance or influential - bulls â  gave I considerable
confidence to the shorts, who covered freely.
Notwithstanding favorable weather for the de
velopment of the 'winter wheat crop, sentiment
during the greater part'of the day was' quite
bullish. At the opening of | the . market July -
was a shade to >i@%c higher at Sl Wu Ão Vic.
May was ViH??4c higher at 03^c to 03)Â«e.
There was little nervousness after the opening
and trade in the May option at !Â»sc, with other
trades at the same moment :at J)3Vic Ito I 94c.
From . these figures there was a gradual de- â 
cline under scattered offerings by Northwestern .
houses and ; a little eleventh-hour liquidation
by *mall traders. - One of the big longs -also,
was credited with enormous sales. The sell
ing pressure was sufficient to force the -price S
01 May down to : 92c ; before - the end of the
first hour. -â¢ Meantime the price of = July had â 
eased off to 84 '.^c under selling by tint pit
traders. Sentiment then changed and for the
remainder of the session a firm ton* pre
vailed. The principal cause for the buying
was a big decrease in the world's visible sup
ply as aralnst' an -Increase of 878,000 bushels
for the corresponding week last- year. An
other bullish factor was 1 a report from . Balti
more that the first contract -shipment, of new
wheat .to Europe had made there to-day. -. In ,
the theory that future deliveries had been gen- â 
erally oversold during the smash In May prices
the dai.iand for the . more â¢ distant ' options was -
active during the last half of the session. .
The market responded to the improved demand,
July advancing to 85% c. The close was '-
strong with July selling at the highest price. .
May closed at Me. Clearances of wheat and
flour t were equal to 76.200 bushels. . Primary
receipt*, wept 389,900 bushels, compared with
204,800 bushels a year ago. Minneapolis, Dv- r
luth and Chicago reported receipts of 314 cars
against 218 cars last : week and 102 cars a -
year ago. . â '..-â¢'. . \ 'â¢* â 
Liquidation of the - May option was. the }
feature of early trading In the corn . market. .
July otHiied at 40?* o to 4Â«^c, sold -between
46% c and-47c, and closoC at the top. Local
receipts were 183 cars, 24 being contract. â  i
Influenced . by â  early weakness â â  of - the â  corn |
market the oats ; market, experienced som* >
depression during, the ttrst hour, but later the
marktt rallied sharply In an attempt /by/"
early sellers to â  reinstate thÂ«ir lines. /JjHy :
opened a shade lower at 29 %c, sold - bfy^een \
2R%G2Oc and 2ii%c, and closed at 29?Â»dr^The ''
local rtccints were -171 cars.
Provisions were weak ( at : the start on profit
taking In pork brought out by a 10c decline

pork was up â¢5c at $12 50, lard was up 7>Â£c -

BIG DEMANDS
FOR SCHOOLS
Hoard of Education Asks for
$1.W0.n00 ill Excess of
Allowance of Last Year
BUILDINGS DANGEROUS
Directors Exhibit Pieces of
â¢ Rotten Wood Taken From
Supports of Three Houses
."â¢ Th* Board of Education startled
'the Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors yesterday with the esti
mate of the School Department -needs
In [he budget. They ask $1,480,000 in
.excess of last year's allowance. The
Finance Committee granted the School
Department $5500 from the urgent ne-
IcesEity fund to repair three school
â  houses that are reported as abso
lutely dangerous.
s "The school buildings of this city are
rotten," declared Director Roncovieri,
"vce don't know when or where an
â¢accident may occur. The possibility
. of a great calamity is Imminent. Cut
down anything but the repairs."
Pieces of roiten timbers were pulled
â¢ from the supports of three of the
schools in question. "Look at this. "
said Director Boyle, crumbling one of
tjie pieces with his ringers. "This is
I .one of the supports of a pair of stairs
over which 4u" children pass daily.
* Three of these schools must be repaired
'Immediately or there will be a terrible
accident. We can not wait for that.
; We make no threats, but something
must be done now." . :
After a brief consultation the com
â¢mittee'agreed to let the Board use $5500
out of the urgent necessity fund for
* the repairs. The $1,480,000 demand
wap the subject of a spirited argument
thai lasted for three hours.
"-We need the money, every cent of
It.'' declared Director Roncovieri.
"Why." said he. "children are being
turned- away from schools because
there is no room for them. Beer sa
loons and ex-beer saloons are being
used as school houses. There are 40
. euch places now being used by our
children.
.The full amount asked by the Board
of -Education is $2,571,826. Of this.
$267,977 is to be used to repair primary
and grammar schools and $33,861 for
hig-h schools. The Board expects 4700,
'- 000 of this from the State and $1,873,
526 from the city.
Mrs. W. P. Angelo and Mrs. E. L..
Baldwin, representing the California
Club, asked that an appropriation be
ntade to board 20 boys at the parental
echool. They pointed out the enor
mous amount of good done by this in
stitution during its brief existence in
-reclaiming boys who otherwise might
. develop into criminals. They, suggest
ed that the money might be taken
* out of the Police Department fund.
â¢ "Walter Morgan asked through his
attorney, Martin Stevens, that allow
ance be made for $2,000 damages which
he says is due him for breach of con
% tract by a former Board.

FIRES A PISTOL
TO CALL MAYOR
Seeking Interview Demented
Man Shoots Twice Un
der City Hall Window
STARTLES THE TAX MSN
Wants Policeman to Unearth
Treasure for Him That He
Says Is Buried in Yard
The i^rks in the Tax Collector's
offlYe at the City Hall were suddenly
made to think of other things than
th^ collection of taxes yesterday af
ternoon by the sharp report of two
pistol-shots fired directly under their
window. This startling serenade was
intended for the Mayor's office, but it
was misplaced because of unintelligent
reasoning that the rhief executive
occupied the whole City Hall.
Louis Salinas of 1752 Howard
street happily thinks he has wealth
immeasurable buried in his back yard,
but declines to dig it up without offi
cial and expert assistance. Some
time since he called on the Mayor and
asked that a policeman be sent to his
house to help unearth the treasure.
But no civil service policeman ever
digs, and the minion of the law so
informed the foolish citizen.
Louis Salinas is persistent, so he
again sought the Mayor's assistance.
He was willing to yield a share of the
wealth If the Mayor would help him,
he afterward explained.
Accordingly the native of Chile
went to the City Hall again, but not
seeing any external^sign of the Mayor
about the place, he flred two blank
shots from an antiquated pistol to at
tract the attention of the municipal
ity's head man. Salinas determined
to find him and have a talk with him.
The distbrber was overcome by sev
eral policemen and witnesses of the
shooting, and now he occupies a
padded cell in the detention hospital

CHINESE CYCLIST
BUMPS ONE.
Chop Suey Is Scattered
Judge Mogan Must Rule on Perplexing
Case of Celestial Injuries.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
1
"Win Que, plump of person and
earnest of speech, declared that his
heavy equipment of adipose tissue was
all that saved him from severe
physical Injury when the bicycle
crashed into his rear elevation. As it
was, the Impact staggered him so that
the tray laden with dishes dropped
from his head to the adamant pave
ment, where the crockery broke to
fragments, his estimated pecuniary
loss being $16. Besides, his nervous
system sustained a serious shock, for
he felt the wheel before he saw it. The
resilience of his body, however, avert
ed the damage that a less corpulent
man would have received. He re
spectfully asked Police Judge Mogan
to pronounce Joe Querlol, youthful
and sveart. guilty of violating the or
dinance which regulates the speed at
which bicycles may be ridden within
the municipal boundaries and also
to compel the payment of monetary
compensation for the property dam
age. His Honor cheerfully complied
with the first request, but expressed
both unwillingness and inability to act
as collecting agent in the premises.
It was on Broadway, between Du
pont and Stockton streets, that the
collision occurred. Win Que was cross-
Ing the thoroughfare and balancing
upon his pate a meal of choice viands
which had been ordered from the chop
suey establishment of which ha was a
director when Master Queriol came
along on his wheel. "Him clom belly
quick, alice same autobeel, you sab
bee?" said Win to the Judge. "Dlen
him hittee me biff. Dishee allee bloke.
Sllxteen dollah. Sabbee? Likee
money."
Police Sergeant Ross and other
members of the Chinatown squad cor
roborated Win's statement as to the
excessive speed of the bicycle, and
Master Queriol endeavored to exten
uate his offense by the plea that he
â¢was "coasting," but the court said he
had no right to relinquish control of
his brakes or pedals while riding on
such a crowded avenue as Broadway.
Minnie Robinson, in her seven
teenth year of existence and rather
pretty of face, wanted to know how
she could have prevented motoneers
and conductors on the Fillmore-street
trolley line and its connection from
mailing amatory missives to her. She
never gave the carmen any encourage
ment to admire her, she informed
Judge Mogan, and therefore she
should not be held to blame for their
epistolary foolishness. When released
from the Magdalen Asylum on proba
tion she was determined to keep her
self to herself, and might have suc
ceeded in doing so if her mother had
been more considerate ln the matter
of providing her with means of recrea
tion, especially theater tickets. A
worshiper of dramatic art, she was not
permitted to attend the playhouse even
once a week.
Probation Officers Flynn and Scott,
who arrested the girl at her mother's
request, told the court that when she
was searched by the prison matron
two extremely "mushy" love letters
from as many smitten carmen were
found in her possession. She was sent
back to the reformatory and will there
remain until she has attained woman's
estate.
Dr. Herbert T. Thornburgb, charged
with having threatened the life of C.
A. Baxter, a Market street pharmacist,
after having forged that gentleman's
name to a $10 check and chloroform
ing his (Mr. B's) wife and compelling
her to accompany him to San Jose,
moved for a continuance of his case
till to-morrow and Judge Mogan
granted the motion. The defendant
was employed by the complainant and
lived at his home, 1434 Buchanan
street, where, it is alleged, he became
enamored of Mrs. Baxter and treated
her as hereinbefore mentioned. It in
cidentally developed that the State
Medical Board is contemplating the
institution of proceedings against Mr.
Baxter to make him prove that he has
not been practicing medicine without
a license at his dispensary.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Andrew Adamson, a burly loafer
who drove his wife and four little
children out of doors while a rainstorm
was raging, will spend the next six
months in the county jail, and at the
expiration of that term he will com
mence another half-year's incarcera
tion for having threatened the life of
his unfortunate better .half. The
Adamson family residence is No. 6
Harrison avenue.
Mrs. Ida Bays, accused of disturbing
the peace by haranguing school chil
dren at San Jose avenue and Twenty
ninth street, was pronounced a disso
lute character by Patrolman W. Ma
honey.
"I'm no more a desolate character
than you are," she retorted.
Judge Mogan gave her three months.
"If you must tipple," said Judge
Mogan to Miss N. Currier, "do so in
your home."
She was arrested at Golden Gate
avenue and Larkin street by a police
man who informed the court that she
was a frequenter of saloon siderooms
ln that neighborhood.
"I always have a gentleman escort,
haven't T?" she asked.
"You do, but yem never have the
same man twice," replied the officer.
She told the Judge she was employed
as a store clerk and had been a pri
vate secretary, also a governess. Her
appearance did not belie the statement.
"You are dismissed," said his Hon
or, "but if you again come before me
on the same charge yqu will regret
having ignored my suggestion that
yo-u do your drinking at home."
"William F. Brady was drunk and en
gaging in his fifth fight within as many
hours when Patrolman Ruggles arrest
ed him at Third and Mission streets.
"I'm an ironworker," he told the
court, "and it was my first drunk since
1 swore off when the last Democratic
President retired from office."
"I presume you then pledged your
self to stay sober until another Demo
cratic President is elected?" ventured
his Honor.
"You've hit it right," responded Mr.
Brady.
"If I let you go free will you renew
that pledge?"
"Sure."
"But it mayâ l don't say it will, but
it mayâ mean total abstinence as long
as you can possibly live."
"It goes, just the same."
He was dismissed.

Mrs. Nora Emerson of 1139 Mission
street was visiting Mrs. Annie Cor
bett at the latter lady's residence. 1123
Mission street, when Steve McHugh,
address not registered, dropped in and
gallantly sent for beer. The trio was
singing "Hoop-de-dooden-do" with
terpsichorean accompaniment, when
Patrolman Harry Crowley arrested
them for disturbing the peace, the time
being last Sunday afternoon.
"Were they very disorderly?" Judge
Mogan asked the policeman.
"It was a regular house of blazes,"
was the reply. "These three were all
1 could take in, but about a dozen
others who escaped were equally
noisy."
As the defendants had spent a night
in prison, and as they collectively and
individually promised to be good, and
as it was their first recorded offense,
they were dismissed.
Fred Braunschulte, who was charged
â¢with having assaulted Fred Peterson
with a deadly weapon, to wit, one
knife, last Saturday afternoon on Mis
sion street, between Fourth and Fifth,
told Judge Cabaniss that he was pro
voked to commit the offense by Mr.
Peterson's undue attentions to hia (Mr.
B's) wife.
"I don't like to have any man hang
ing around my wife," said Mr. Braun
schulte.
"But did he hang around her?" the
Court inquired.
The defendant answered affirmative
ly and Patrolman Lagrange corrobor
ated the assertion. "This man Braun
schulte told me that Peterson wouldn't
let his wife alone," said the officer,
"and the woman herself told me that
her husband and Peterson had several
fights about her."
"Ha, ha," exclaimed the bench; "the
plot thickens. "While I can't entirely
approve your knife-play, Mr. Braun
schulte, I can't blame you for object
ing to Mr. Peterson's paying court to
your spouse. As for you, Mr. Peterson,
you should know better than to pur
sue Mrs. Braunschulte."
"Haven't I a talk coming?" Mr. Pet
erson asked.
"If you continue your pursuit of
Mrs. Braunschulte you are likely to
have the Coroner coming, and there
would be few sincere mourners at
your funeral," was the response.
Mr. Peterson's effort to inform the
court that his attentions to Mrs.
Braunschulte were not rejected by the
lady proved utterly futile, and he de
parted from the courtroom evidently
regretting that he had entered it.
You are dismissed," said the Judge
to Mr. Braunschulte, "and I would
suggest that you abstain from the use
of deadly weapons if you should again
find your honor threatened by Mr.
Peterson or any other admirer of the
lady who shares your lot."
Mr. Braunschulte did not ask for fur
ther enlightenment as to how he should
preserve the sanctity of his hearth.
After he had arrested and booked
Alex D. Graham for drunkenness and
malicious mischief, Patrolman T. H.
Dowd himself tippled to excess and
was suspended from duty, so when the
case of Mr. Graham was called before
Judge Mogan there was no appearance
for the prosecution and dismissal was
ordered. Mr. Graham, who dwells at
202 Langton street, is a glassblower,
but it was for glass-breaking that Pa
trolman Dowd arrested him, said glass
forming a window of his domicile.
Judge Conlan reduced the bail of
Julio Ziegner Uriburu, accused of em
bezzling 27,000 francs from Lucia Te
trazzini, prima donna soprano, from
$10,000 to $4000, and Julio's counsel
promised to have him released from
durance ere yesterday's sun set.

LIVELY GOSSIP
OF POLITICIANS
Battle for Local Supremacy
Will Not Be Muddled by
Gubernatorial Aspirations
ISSUE A SINGLE ONE
Citizens of San Francisco
Eesolved That Change in
City Affairs Is Needed
The Sacramento Union, through its
Pan Francisco correspondent, has dis
covered that George D. Clark, presi
dent of the Republican League of this
city, and Arthur G. Fisk, Postmaster,
dwell in the Thirty-seventh Assembly
District. Some stress is laid on the
fact that the Postmaster is an aspirant
for gubernatorial honors, and the con
clusion is drawn that Fisk is in the
league movement to help his candi
dacy in the future. The Postmaster is
quoted as saying to the Union:
"You have been correctly informed.
I am a candidate for Governor with
out condition or reservation. If you
hear of anybody who wants to support
a man who means business, who
knows what he wants and knows pretty
well huw to get it, please send him
around."
The inference is drawn that the Thir
ty-seventh District delegation to the
Republican State Convention at 1906
will be for Fisk if the Postmaster and
George D. Clark continue to pull to
gether until that time. The general
fact that the Thirty-seventh Assembly
District is thickly populated with clev
er politicians is overlooked. Others in
the district are William J. Ruddick,
Fred Jones, George H. S. Dryden,
George H. Bahrs, C. B. Perkins, John
W. Rogers, William J. Young, R. V.
Lucy, Anthony Gallagher, H. T. Sime,
F. Bceckman, W. S. Dennis, J. R. ilc-
Guflick and John E. Green. All of
these and many others must be con
sulted before the slate is made up for
the delegation from the Thirty-seventh
Assembly District to the Republican
State Convention of 1906.
At the present time the voters ot the
district are giving their undivided po
litical attention to the municipal cam
paign of this year. The pride of the
district is, of course, touched by the
suggestion that the gubernatorial bee
is buzzing in the bonnet of a promi
nent citizen of. the Thirty-seventh. But
there are other bonnets, other districts
and other postmasters. The same bee
buzzes in the chapeau of J. O. Hayes.
Its music is heard in the Shortridge
tile. Sometimes Alden Anderson,
Charles M. Belshaw, Charles F. Curry,
E. P. Colgan, John F. Davis, E. C.
Voorheis, Thomas Flint, Dr. Chester
Rowell, B. M. Sweeney, C. R. Garoutte,
Henry A. Melvin, W. C. Ralston, M. L.
Ward, S. C. Smith and many other
well-known Republicans hear the al
luring buzz. Surely Postmaster Fisk
has no monopoly on the gubernatorial
bee. When all is said and done, the
contented bee may alight again in the
headgear of Governor Pardee and stay
there for four years more.
The voters in San Francisco view the
remote gubernatorial contest with com
plete indifference. A little cloud of In
land dust may be raised to warn Gov
ernor Pardee that his friends in the
city must not cross the path of United
States Senator George C. Perkins. If
the talk of Postmaster Fisk for Gov
ernor has any political significance it
signifies that George Hatton is alarmed
lest the key of the machine should be
misplaced.
The Republicans of San Francisco re
gard with infinite satisfaction the fact
that the way is clear for a fair battle
for local supremacy at the forthcoming
election. There is no fight for Gov
ernor or other State officers to com
plicate the situation. There are no
members of the Legislature to elect
and there is no confusing Senatorial
struggle in sight to distract the atten
tion of party leaders. The campaign
is to be conducted on the single issue
of better government for San Fran
cisco. If candidates for Governor and
Senator butt in to gain some future
advantage, it will be bad for the but
ters, because the citizens of the me
tropolis have firmly resolved that a
change ln the methods of local admin
istration must be had. The San Fran
cisco Republican League will not ask
any voter to tie himself to this or that
gubernatorial aspirant or to enlist for
any other campaign than the present
one. Every voter in town, however,
will be asked to join hands with the
San Francisco Republican League in
order to rescue the city from the forces
of graft.
