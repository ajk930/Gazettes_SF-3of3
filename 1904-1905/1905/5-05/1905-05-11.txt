' HARRISBURG, Pa., May ii. âAn. express
train on the Pennsylvania Railroad ran into a freight
train in which there were two cars loaded-with-Tiyna
mite at i :io o'clock this morning in South Harris
burg, near the plant of the Paxtang Light, Heat and
â¢Power Company.
Three terrific explosions that broke windows
throughout the city followed and the two trains were
Completely wrecked and took fire./ It was estimated
at 3 o'clock that fifty persons were killed and one
hundred injured, though these figures may prove too
Email.
It is impossible to ascertain the exact number of
Natalities, because the wreckage in which many of
the passengers and some members of the train crews
are pinned is still ablaze and unapproachable and
tnany small explosions occur continually.
Bodies Hurled Into the River.
When the first explosion occurred bodies were thrown
Clear out of the berths in the sleeping cars, landing
iflown the railroad embankment and some . even having been
hurled into the Susquehanna River, which parallels the rail
road in that locality.
All the physicians of the city procurable were summoned
to work with the injured.
A fire alarm sounded, and the firemen arrived to find
themselves practically helpless in the work of rescue. A
police patrol wagon was commissioned as an ambulance,
and as many of the injured as possible were" loaded into it
on each trip and taken to the Harrisburg Hospital, the ca
pacity of which soon became taxed because of the large num
bers that were brought in. A special train was made up
which brought injured and dying to the Union station.
Many of the injured were taken into private houses.
Immediately after the wreck the passengers who could do
bo ran from the scenes of horror to safety from the â¢ inces
sant small explosions. ' . '
The agonizing cries of the unfortunates were heartrend
ing
The office of the Paxtang Light, Heat and: Power Com
pany looked^ like a hospital. At an early* hour the Harris
burg Traction Company ran out a number of cars from its
South Harrisburg barns and used them to bring the injured
to the hospital. J .'-.
Hotels Are Turned Into Hospitals.
"With practically no clothing, many women and children
from the train were compelled to wander : about the fields,
as there are few} houses in the immediate vicinity of the
wreck. ,
The train was the second section of No. 19. There were
163 passengers in the train, and the latest estimate is -that
fifty were killed. The hospital is crowded to the dodrs and
the hotels are being opened for the care of the injured. ; It
may be necessary for the authorities to seize one of the
hotels and turn it into a temporary hospital/
The following are among the injured: Harry Spritzer,
Finnburg, critical; George Crabbe, Pittsburg, badly cut arid
bruised : Charles de Forest, . Cleveland, . Ohio, seriously hurt
internally, cut and bruised; H.K Harmon, Pittsburgh arm
â¢ broken, cut and bruised: Charles Johnson, Philadelphia, bad

three men at Provo, Utah, was arrested
at Williamson to-day after a desperate
battle with officers. Marshal Johnson

SALT LAKE CITY. May 10.â Sheriff
Harmon will send at once a deputy to

with the murder of three Provo boys
who disappeared from their home In
February, 1595. Later their bodies <jrif t
ed ashore in Utah Lake, and it was
evident they had been dropped through
a hole in the ice after beine murdered.
Henry Hayes, stepfather of the boys,

tenced to be executed, but evidence
was produced which secured him a full
pardon.
Wright Is about 40 years old, is a eon
of a well-to-do Minnesota farmer and
was educated for the law at Ann Ar

The President said that he would
read it at once, and after doing so

"Now let me repeat that" I know

GREET CHIEF
CHICAGO, May 10.â Honoring and
honored. by his political- foea but per
sonal friends, President Roosevelt was
to-night\the chief , : guest at a : magnifi
cent banquet tendered him by the Iro
quois Club, the leading Democratic or
ganization of | Illinois. ' Surrounded by
men who have fought against him ' in
two national campaigns,- who: depre
cate many of his avowed; policies; and
who have frowned upon some of his
political actions, the President was to
night cheered to the echo as he entered
and left the banquet , hall, was ap
plauded with enthusiasm throughout
his address and ' at its close and wan
given to understand that . ; in his ; case
political differences were not a y per
sonal issue.
The banquet, which was from first to
last an ovation, was given entirely by
Democrats to the leader of their, polit
ical opponents and many -of the kindly
personal references made by the speak
ers of. the evening,* the majority of
whom were men" of Democratic .faith,
deeply touched the President. In his
manner and words he evinced through
out the evening a deep gratification at
the warmth of his - reception from men
who have fought him in political bat- 1
ties before now and- are ready to fight
him again to-morrow if they considered
it necessary. Throughout | the entire
evening, however, ran the dominant
note of admiration for the character
of and friendship for the man himself.
GREETED WITH 'CHEERS.
The great banquet hall of the Au
ditorium never held a gathering more
representative than that which as T
sembled to-nlg ht to do honor to Pres
ident Roosevelt. Given under the aus
pices of a Democratic organization as
it was, it was but natural S that I the
majority of those present should -be
members of that party, but scattered
throughout the banquet hall were
many men strong "in Republican doc
trines and high in the councils of their
party in Illinois. At the President's
table were Mayor Edward F. Dunne;
Charles F. Guntber, president of the
Iroquois Club ; James Hamilton Lewis,
who acted as toastmaster;. Samuel
Altschuler, Judge Murray F. Tuley,
Sheriff. Thomas, E. Barrett and other
Democrats. Of the Republicans there
were at the same table Governor De
neen. Senator A. J. Hopkins, Judge C.
C. Kohlsaat. Judge J. W. Landis and
a dozen more.-
Prior to the banquet itself, which
was set for 7 o'clock, the President
held an informal reception in the
rooms of the Art Institute, adjoining
the Auditorium on the north.
A few moments before 7 o'clock the
President entered .the banquet hall. He
had been preceded by . several hun
dred of the guests, and his arrival was
the signal for an outburst of cheers
that continued until the President had
traversed the .long hall: a*nd stood by
his .seat at the speaker's table. The
President .bowed repeatedly in ack
nowledgment of the hearty, welcoome
extended to him.' .. it ' :!
The menu was long, and fully one
and . a half . hours ; was consumed be
fore its end was reached. At 9 o'clock
President Gunther of the Iroquois Club
called the guests to order and' made a
brief address of welcome to the Presi
dent Toastmaster Lewis also spoke
briefly. J. M. Dickinson, the first
formal. speaker*, responded to the toast
"The Iroquois Club." Governor Deneen
who followed him, spoke on "Illinois.'.'
When at the conclusion of the ad
dress of Governor Deneen Lewis arose
to introduce President Roosevelt, the
entire assembly was on its feet, wav
ing handkerchiefs and : . napkins and
cheering with vigor. When his ' voice
could be heard Lewis happily intro
duced the President, wha spoke as fol
lows:
! - I very deeply appreciate the honor of being
i your guest and guest of ' the city of Chicago
this evening; and," in looking at the possi
bilities of the future, let me add that I have

GOOD MEN FROM ILLINOIS.
Having drawn an Illinois ' citizen, : at leaat
one by adoption, for 1 one bit ; of - work," let me
speak of something that has . happened ? more
recently. One of the works Uncle - Sam has on
hand .Just \u25a0at present is \u25a0 digging the \u25a0 Panama
canal â and It is going to be dug. 3 (Cheers and
cries of "Good,. good.");; It Is going to be dug

efficiency, but with efficiency first, i 1 wanted
Congress to give me â¢: power ! to ' remodel = the
commission. ' It did not do It. . I remodeled It
anyhow and purely in the exercise of .' my ex
ecutive ; functions, . and a I : made wupi my > mind
this time - that : I \u25a0 was \u25a0 not '\u25a0 going ; to ' make \u25a0 the
slightest effort i to : : represent different Â» sections
of the country. on that canal. I was g-oing to
try . to have | the whole country represented \u25a0 and
put the best man I 'could get' In any, given po
sition without the i slightest :: regard ito - where
he came from.' .-.' And,* while it was awaccident,
still I may mention It as a fortunate accident.
General Wilmon W. Blackmar, com
mander in chief of the Grand Army of
the Republic, was the guest last even
ing of the comrades of the San Fran
cisco posts in the assembly hall of the
Pioneer building, where he and the par
Â£y accompanying him on his official
visits were tendered a reception.
â¢The hall was decorated with the flags
of the different army corps, American
flags and beautiful flowers, and the
party marched into it to the sound of
field music and preceded by the color
guard of Lincoln, George H. Thomas,
James A. Garfield, Colonel Cass and
George C. Meade posts, with- colors
flying.
Colonel C. Mason Kinne, P. S. V.,
commander in chief, who had been se
lected as chairman of the evening, sent
a letter of regret at inability to be pres
ent on account of the serious illness of
his wife, therefore A. J. Vining of
George H. Thomas Post filled his posi
tion. After the commander and party
had been escorted to seats on the stage
Miss Helen Colburn Heath sang "The
Star-Spangled Banner," the audience
Joining in the chorus. The . Calif ornla
Quartet sang "All Honor to the Sol
dier." after which Sterling Sturges
delivered an eloquent address of wel
come, which was followed by the in
troduction of the commander in chief
with the announcement that when he
finishes his tour of official visits he
will have done what no other com
mander has ever done, namely, visited
every. Grand Army department in the
United States. He was greeted with
applause and the singing by the audi
ence of "He's a Jolly Good Fellow."
The commander thanked : his .'.com
rades and the many ladies" present for
the generous- reception, and then
spoke at some length of the grand
body he commands, interspersing his
address with 'reminiscences of the Civil
War, saying that the organization ;is
proud of them. He expressed aston
ishment that any man who followed
the flag during the | war should hesi
tate to join some post. He said that
the 'people of the United States to-day
are searching all sorts of records to
discover if they are not descendants
of Revolutionary War soldiers,, and
that in generations to come v people
will search the records'of the Grand
Army to discover if their sires were
soldiers of the Union, and for that
reason he thought every one who was
a Union soldier should be enrolled

est and most dangerous rock *in the course of
any republic â the rock of class hatred. It
meant disaster and ultimately the downfall of
the republic. No true patriot \ will -. fall ' to ; do
everything in his power, to, prevent .the growth
of "any such spirit in this country. *. This Gov
ernment 1Â» not and never : shall be 5 the gov
ernment of a plutocracy. -> This Government is
not and never shall ' be ' the . eovernment of a
mob. - 1 believe in corporations. They are in
dispensable Instruments of. our modern I Indus
trialism, but I believe' that they should be : so
supervised and regulated . that they \u25a0 should act !
for the Interest of the community as a whole. {
So I believe In unions. I am proud of the fact I
that I am an honorary member . of ; one union, |
but I believe thaf the union, like f the indi
vidual, must be kept to a strict accountability
to the power of the law. " - .-,"
Mayor Dunne, as President .of ; the United
States,, and therefore as representative of the
people of this country, I give you as a matter i
of course my hearty support -In upholding the !
law, In putting down violence,- whether ;by a I
mob or by an, lndividual. (Cheers, \ with manyJ
standing, waving handkerchiefs, napkins, I
etc.) And there need not be the slightest ap
prehension in the heaits of the. most timid that
ever,: the mob spirit will . triumph in this coun
try.. Those immediately responsible* for deal
ing with the trouble must, as : I know t you
will, exhaust every effort in so dealing with It
, before a call Is made uson , any ouside body.
But if ever the need arise,- back of the city,
stands the State and back of - the State stands
the nation. .And. there, gentlemen. Is a point
upon which all good Americans are one. \u25a0- They
are all one In the conviction, in the firm deter
mination that this country shall remain in the
future, as it has been in the past." a* country
of liberty and Justice under the i forms of -law. k

the nation would stand j for the preser
vation of order in Chicago, wild cheers
and' vigorous' clapping of,' hands inter
rupted him for several, minutes. When
he brought his address to a close ? his
auditors | shouted, cheered and , waved
their: napkins in approval. Dozens *of
the guests mounted chairs and shouted
until they were hoarsei Some of them."
carried away wlth"enthusiasm, : . jumped
upon the tables, heedless ;orÂ»linen and

Mayor 'Dunne, profoundly i moved by
the .words of the President] sprang
from his seat i and \u25a0 grasped the Presi

while T^e expressed : his! gratitude. . -
: For fully ten minutes the hall : rang
with the applause, v while bath ",, Demo

back in the going at Recreation Park.
Consequently the Commuters were kept
in a -state of : nervous " prostration till !

even, though nine hits, were tornoff the

The 'game clearly Illustrated the
value of base hits when : they come at
an" opportune time. The Angels* only
copped off - six, but they secured them
when a' hit counted for b run. Conse
quently .the .three came easy.; Hall
pitched (the same kind of ball he used
when : the f Angels captured the flag a
couple of years ago. He never became
a bit ..wobbly when . -.the Commuters
planted men on the sacks. In three
innings Oakland bunched two hits at a
time, but that was the r>est they could
do. :..â¢:â¢ ?.-\u25a0:) â¢\u25a0:-\u25a0, .?*: - \u25a0:< \u25a0\u25a0...
Graham was ; soused when the â¢ An

the tale of his ' downfall. ; He was

have won if his teem mates had a rally
left. The stick work of Smith and Dil
lon counted' for the Angels in their
hour of need. The big third baseman
swung for a double and a triple, while
the "cap" of the layout was there with
a pair of singles. : Smith made the cir

Both teams played a fast game in the
field and many hard chunces - were

Beauty and fashion paid homage to
the dogs at Mechanics' Pavilion yester
day at the most auspicious opening of
a kennel dub show in many years. The
aisles were thronged with fanciers dur
ing the afternoon and evening, while
an interested crowd watched the
awarding of the ribbons in the ring.
The dogs were shown In splendid
condition, especially the \u25a0 aristocratic
English setters, which have been on
the circuit of shows since last October.
The class of the show is exception
ally high in most of the breeds. The
setters and pointers are an entrancing
study for the sportsmen, being the
finest ever shown here, while the toy
terriers and the beautiful bulldogs at
tract the ladies. The sporty fox ter
riens and the grim and noisy Great
Danes each have a following, while the
kindly St. Bernards interest many.
Hermann Oelrichs' Great Dane Rex
viewed the passing show from the
veranda of his bucgalow, which was
placed at the western end of the Pa
vilion. The dog's serious countenance
was a continual source of delight to the
spectators.
A eign over another Great Dane's
kennel read: "Please let me alone. I
don't like strangers." The sign was
hardly necessary.
The toy terriers were, as usual, a
strong attraction for the ladies and
children, who found much to admire in
the tiny pets.
The judging of Thomas Ashton of
England was a revelation. His work
was expeditious and clean-cut, the
dogs being kept in the ring but a few
minutes. One hundred and thirteen
classes were disposed of during the
afternoon and evening. The judge of
ficiated at 101 shows in England
last year.
Three large showcases filled^ with
artistic prizes were a continual' stim
ulus to the exhibitors to bring out the
etrong points of their dogs. Many
fair owners took their own dogs into
the ring and were applauded when
ever they carried off a ribbon. The
unusual number of prizes is chiefly
due to the efforts of the officials of
the specialty clubs who were ener
getic in securing them.
The judging will be resumed this
morning, when the collies will be the
first class sent into the ring. The
bulldog* "will probably be reached
this afternoon and the fox terriers this
evening. The competition among the
terriers will be particularly; keen. The
awards:

The most exciting: and nerve-rackins
game : ever played , here between hlgii
school baseball nines took place at the
Presidio Athletic Grounds yesterday
afternoon, when the Lick , Tigers took
the delegation ; of ': the Lowell High
School into camp in the eleventh Inning
by the score ' of 4 to' 3. The game was
won by well-earned tallies, "errors be
ing few and far. between.
The game was interesting for many
reasons. The J intense rivalry existing
between the two- schools had been
fanned to a white heat earlier in the
season by a \ close but uncompleted
game. The clash yesterday was to
settle all disputes, and the rooters of
the black and gold. and of the Butter
street school flocked to the battlefield
armed with megaphones and banners.
It was anybody's game from the start
to the final drive of ' Hall, Lick's crack
catcher, who walloped the A ball beyond
reach; bringing home the deciding tally.

Pane Signs aContract With
Morris Levy Before Sam
Berger Conies to Rescue
Sam Berber, amateur .h^avy-wefjht
champion, budded out as a boxing: pro
moter last night and signed up Jimmy
Britt and Battling Nelson to box before
the Western Athletic dub in July or
August. Berger accomplished thl3 feat'
after Nelson and Willie Britt argued
vainly for two hours at Harry Corbett'a
in the afternoon, the division, of thÂ©
purse being the stickler.
Accordlngr % to the articlea signed by
the men th%y . agree to box at 133
pounds at 6 o'clock on the evening of
the mill for 65 per cent of the gross re-,
celpts, to be divided ,75 to tha winner
and 25 to the loser. The contestants
| will meet and name a referee five days .
before the date of the battle.: In case
they fall to come to ,' an . agreement,
each snail select, one man and then toss"
a coin to decide who shall Judse.tha
all Important bout.
Manager Berger of the "Western . Ath
letic Club says he Is guaranteed a per
mit for either July or August and has
posted a 1*2500 forfeit with Harry Cor
bett to promote the fight. In the mean
time. Morris Levy ha 3 signed Nelson to
box under the auspices of the Hayes
Valley Athletic Club for the same
months, so a merry war will soon be
waged over the permit.
, The division of the purse was the big
obstacle In the way of the rivals when
they met In the af ternoon." Nelson In
sisted the men fight before the clnb of
fering the largest purse, but that the
men divide at least 65 per cent of the
gross receipts. He did this, he said, to
beat Britt out of his customary bonus;
saying he was as good a drawing card
a 3 James and did not want the latter
to get any shade.
. Willie Britt would not stand fbr any
thing like that. He refused to listen .
to Nelson's argument and the pair ex
changed compliments and opinions in
such a manner as to make it decidedly,
interesting. Willies voice, as usual."
was In splendid trim and the boy.ora
tor could be. heard for , blocks, voicing
hiÂ» protests against the division of the
purse.
Finally Willie got up and left the
Dane alone in his glory. Soon after
Morris Levy had a confab with Nelson
and his. manager. 'Billy Nolan, and
agreed to offer 65 per cent of the gross]
receipts to the men, provided ihey\
would pay the referee out of their
share. This suited Nelson and his
manager and they Immediately signed
with Levy. '- The Britts overlooked this
bet,. -but flnally yielded ,-to ' 7 ;J3ergCT's
terms and so the match tvas Jrained up.
Both - men's forfeits Â« are 2 upjT Nelson

The feature of the racing at Kenil
worth Park, Petaluma, yesterday was
the Ladies" selling stake for two-year
clds at half a mile, which proved only a
warming-up gallop for the Napa Stock
\u25a0Farm's clever filly Daruma, ridden by
Frank Sullivan. There were only half
a dozen starters and wnen one layer
had the temerity to chalk up 3 to 2
about Daruma he was swamped in a
Jiffy. Southern Lady had a host of ad
mirers, but the heavy condition of th-Â»
track probably augured against her
chances, for she made a poor showing.
The contender turned up in ladora, a
20 to 1 shot, with Earnshaw in the sad

epeed the favorite won by four lengths,
under half pressure. Third money fell
to Dangerous Girl. Entered to be sold

â¢ SAX JOSE. May 10.â The laying of
the corner6tone of the new High
School at Santa Clara has brought on
a controversy between Father R. E.
Kenna, president of Santa Clara Col
lege, and the Town Board of Educa
tion.-'A' few weeks since the" grand
officers of the "Masonic lodge were
asked to lay the cornerstone, which
will shortly be ready, and the Masonic
Lodge ' accepted the offer. Father
Kenna recently addressed a letter to
the board, asking that to no associa
tion or lodge be delegated the work of
laying the cornerstone, but that the
ceremony be performed under the di
rection of the Mayor and the people
of Santa Clara. The reverend father
trasted a holiday made of the event,
so that all- the people might partici
pate In It.
The Board of Education on May 5
replied to Father Kenna'e letter, in
which it expressed regret that the
communication had not been received
before^arrangementa had been made,
which could not now be changed with
, out giving offense.
Father Sienna in reply sayÂ«J he ob
jects to any lodge or association hav
ing charge of the ceremonies, and
adds: "If the board persists in adher
ing to what I deem an unjust arrange
ment I shall consider it a petty tyranny
worthy of a board of Russian auto
crats, and now, in the name of many
of our faithful . taxpayers, I most
solemnly protest against this arrange
ment as unwise, unjust and certainly
very objectionable to many of your
fellow qitizens."
Action, on the matter will come up
before the Board of Education next
Monday evening.

HALFMOON . BAY, May . 10.â An Im
portant agitation has been started'her*
for the construction' of Â» wagon road
which will tap the rich La Honda
district and divert \u25a0to this town much
of the valuable traffic and trade that. la
now. monopolized by Redwood City and
Palo, Alto. In and around La Honda a,
very profitable -trade has developed
from the presence of many hundreds
of summer, visitors and the prospect
of a coastwise railroad has made tha
possibilities for traffic many times
greater. It is to take advantage of 'this
traffic that the construction of a wagon
road is being urged. ..
A wagon road constructed from Half
moon .Bay rive miles to the east, to
connect -.with v the county .road would
make all of the traffic tributary, -to. thla
town. Such a road was surveyed.many
years ago and can be built on a 4. per
cent grade.. It is argued that if the
county road funds be not sufficient or
available private subscriptions should
be raised at once to begin the^highway.
At present Redwood City and Palo
Alto on the north and San Gregorio on
the south have good roads into *La
Honda and reap the natural fruits ~6f
such an advantage. ..JVhen the railroad
becomes a reality it Is feared that San
Gregorio will not only obtain Its share
of the resulting traffic, but will absorb
that which should belong to Halfmoon
Bay. Such an . event would be a very
serious one for Halfmoon Bay, as at a
single stroke it would lose its primacy
among the coast towns of San 'Mateo
County. A wagon road such as ' that
now being discussed would prevent any
change of existing conditions. -

SAN MATEO, May 10.â President
George W. Dickie of the board of trsu
tees of the â¢ San Mateo Ldbraqr has
been notified that 'Andrew Cafnegie
will - donate ; $10,000 ~for a : new library
building. t' About a. month ago the trus
tees made application 'to Carnegie" for
$15,000 f ori a^ new building,* but . he saw.
fit ; to " allow only \u25a0 $10,000. Tjhe sum is
not ". sufficient. ' There are now about
7000 volumes .; in f the library and â¢' the
number is steadily increasing/ The 11
brary:wilFneed at least a $15,000 build
ing," and the trustees are in a quandary
as to ;w|hat disposition to . make of the
Carnegie gift. One of. the conditions of
the gift is that 'the library shall bear
the name of the donor, but If a part of
the; building, fund is raised by .popular
subscription It will not be In a strict
sense .a r, (Jarnegie . library. To decline
the gift would be ungracious ; to erect
an inadequate building or an unfinished
one would be folly. To renew the orig
inal request | for â¢ $15,000 is to Incur the
risk â¢of being deemed importunate, and
to : supplement the sum In hand with
other funds is to Interfere with the in
tentions "of the. philanthropist, who
doesn't â¢â¢ care ' to take a partner in his
public offerings. .All- these-considera
tions combine to place; the trustees in
a position of embarrassment in which
they. find it difficult to. act.
l In' any event a hew; building will be
6ecured, as it has become a necessity.
A site for/ it may be* obtained from
either the high or grammar school.
The; present site was a gift from An
toine Borel,: a -wealthy . banker. It is
occupied by ' a brick block which is
used for city offices,. Council : chamber,
etc., and two of_the ground floors are
rented, 4 to a bank, and the telephone
company, respectively. Some years
ago ; Borel ' donated the ground to ' the
city on condition that' when it was no
longer.-- used {for library purposes it
should revert to his estate. . What \u25a0he
may â¢ have \u25a0to say in the present con
tingency Is not : known. The ; city se
cured the building by paying. off a debt
on it, but this also would revert" to
Borel. When the trustees desired to
remove the â¢ library from "its present
cramped quarters : to the , principal hall
upstairs ; a short time ago the City
Trustees ; objected on the ground that
all available room -would 1 soon be re
quired for the city's use*-: It is this that
has ' created, the necessity for a new
building. â 7-o : i^,. ;-.;;.. - \u0084

BERKELEY, 'MaY 10.â The ambi
tions of k doeen Berkeley youths td"
emulate the deeds described In penny
dreadfuls. Or' dime novels, -have led'
them intft the arms of Marshal Voll
mo- and bis' merry --men, 'who- discov-!
Â«>red to-day a "robber's retreat*' so skill-. |
fully designed that had It: not been for j
outside assistance the officers â¢ prob- I
ably never would have stumbled on j
the place. ;
Benjamin Johnson, a 9-year-old lad.
ringleader of the crowd of - boys, was
suspected of knowing a good deal about
the actions of a gang of youngsters in
North Berkeley whose antics have wor
ried their parents and distressed the
neighbors. Benjamin gave the clew
that enabled the officers to find the
b&ys' resort In the Straw-berry Creek
culvert beneath the business section
of the town. Entrance to this Is gained
through a manhole between Grove
etfeet and Shattuck avenue. .Here, on
a concrete platform, the Doys gambled,
smoked and discussed the depredations
.that they committed later.
The boys reached this rendezvous with
the aid of a rope that hung from the
manhole. In a thistle patch near the
N'azarene Church on Center street the
boys had another retreat, cleverly con
cealed. Evidence of their gambling
habits was found there.
â¢ A* M. Scott complained to the police,
to-day that his son Milton, an 8-year
r>!d lad, was being influenced by this
frang In a wrong direction and he de
sired the crowd to be warned and dis
persed by the police.
Ben Johnson and Milton Bealy were
placed in the town Jail this afternoon,
after admitting to the officers their
connection with the gang, and the
meeting places of the crowd will be
broken up by the marshal's men.

WASHINGTON, : May 10.â Director of
the Census North : has been making an
esti mate of the i populations of the va
rious States and of the largest "ten cities
of the Union. He* says that the popu
lation of the country in 1905 is about
82,589,020.
California's population is 1,403,239, an
increase of about 19,000 sinee '1904. '.
Director North places San Francisco
in the list as the. ninth city in size, and
gives its population "as 360.298 in 1904 !
and :. 364,677. in 1905. These -. figures .do |
not : speak very accurately for the ,
United: States census, office method- of
calculating, as according to the esti
mates San Francisco has grown only, a
few ' thousand \u25a0 since 1900. ; According to
Chamber of Commerce figures San
Francisco has about 430,000 inhabitants,
i .Washington has just; completed a'po
lice' census;, that shows that the city
has more than 322,000 inhabitants, yet
Washington to all appearances that
tend ,to establish such things' has not
more \u25a0 than * one-half the > population of
San Francisco. \ :
Promotion Committee maps largely |
distributed here claim 425,000 popula- !
tion for. San Francisco, which is only a â¢
i few . thousand ": more than the Water '\u25a0
company's ; estimates made there some
months ago.
ii Some controversy has resulted among
those interested on account of the wide
differences between coast' and Wash
! ington estimates. The Southern Pacific
and; SantaFe .figures show, that thou
sands *of persons^ have been . entering
the State ;of California "for settlement, |
yet the census calculations are, that the
" State's population has increased only
about 27,000 in Â» one": year." Los Angeles
alone 'is claiming almost , this number
; of increase of population for the i same
period, and Southern California esti
mates are -that "about 40,000 people
have J made their homes* in Southern
California , -during the past twelve
â¢months." <;?-;-â¢ -

TOKIO, May 10. â Al E. Bougoin, a
prominent Frenchman, and his step

been arrested here as spies.
The police searched Bougoin's home,
arrested Strange and seized papers and
documents. Bougoin was arrested at
his country place in Hayama and
brought to Tokio. Bougoin's Japanese
servant also was placed under, arrest.
The exact nature of the. charges
against Bougoin and Strange have not
been made public, but It is understood
that the allegation is made. that they
supplied military information .to the
XO HAVEN FOR XEBOGATOFF.
TOKIO. May 10.â The Nichi Nichi
discussing French neutrality to-mor
row will say that Japan has a right to
demand of Great Britain that she carry
into practice the provisions of the An
glo-Japanese alliance. .
"French duplicity." the Nichi Nichi
will say, "affords the occasion."
Continuing, the Nichi Nichi will de
clare that the- assistance given Vice
Admiral Rojestvensky is a clear breach
of neutrality and a violation oT.a defi
nite pledge given to Japan. The Nichi
Nichi will say further: \u25a0\u25a0V V V-
Japan is justified in assumias that France
te deliberately assisting Kuseia. France's iÂ»osi
tion as Russia's ally is entitled to some sym
jiathy, but after France gave -a definite pledge
nothing remains to exonerate France from thÂ«
charge of duplicity. Japan never suspected
that the French republic would be cuilty of
double dealing. - -.-V
The prestige of France as a champioÃ of clv
l-iraii -:: demands that she correct her attitude
â¢ rid exonerate herself of the charge of base
cess.
In conclusion the Nichi Nichi will
say:
Let France either publicly range herself on
the side of Russia or manfully adhere to the
principle of strict neutrality.
The Government maintains its re
Â§erve, but the Indo-Chinese situation
peems to be rapidly approaching a cri
sis. Following: the repeated assurance
of Foreign Minister Delcasee that the
second Russian Pacific squadron would
be ordered out of French territorial
waters, the Navy Department has re
ceived reliable information that a por
tion of the Russian squadron was lying:
In Honkohe Bay on the morning of May
6. It Is generally believed that the
third Russian squadron will use French
waters to coal, receive supplies and
clean the ships' bottoms, and it is dif
ficult to predict future events.
The agitation against France com
mercially is growing despite the re
pressive influences at work upon the
part of the Government, and a boycott
resolution may yet reach a vote in the
Chamber of Commerce.
PARIS. May 10.â The Marquis de
Barthe'emy. who with Count de Pour
talep operates the French concession at
Kamranh Bay. Annam. in the course
of an interview to-day denies that his
establishment furnished coal or pro
vision? to the Russian second Pacific
squadron. He said:
The maximum of our coaline facilities is
7W tens. This Ss an insignificant quantity for
the fllty-two warships of Admiral Rojestven
sky's squadron, whirh establishes the fact
ihat we could not repeal thÂ«? squadron.
<\*rieerriing th<? chare? that the squadron
secured ccal at Saigon, the fact is that a small
coal'-Wi dejot exists on the Mekong River, not
mr from Salmon. At the outset of the war
the Russians bought a large tract of land
there *:Â«*~ted rh*is and accumulated supplies. :
lÂ«ati!<*utarly coal, which was bought originally
from Jaosn. fit is to this depot that Admiral
Roj-Jrtvnsky sent lila colliers, but no warship
arproathf^i *th" dfpet. This was Russian coal,
placed u;>on-.RuÂ«ian land and. loaded upon
Kussian transports. This was not a violation
-of neutrality. France could not prevent the
RuseJar-s from taking their own coal on their
cwn land. -If 'the natives were at fault In
eelUns the lard to t!ie Russians the Japanese
would not have waited fifteen months before
protesting.

Household pets are susceptible to a
far, greater .variety 'of diseases than
most people imagine, says the Kansas
City Journal. Parrots are known to
be susceptible to a disease so peculiar
to themselves that it Is called from- the
Greek word for parrot "psittacosis." A
number of fatal cases in human beings
of what was at* first supposed -'to be a
malignant influenzal * pneumonia were
in Paris traced to the bacillus at pres
ent thought to be causative of the par
rot disease. A certain proportion lof
parrots are known to die from tuber
culosis. Cats are known sometimes ' to
have â¢ tuberculofiis, and that they have lp
many cases been carriers jof \u25a0 diphtheria
and other of the ordinary infections di

T""""< UROPEAN politics for two centuries has *be'en occupied with '
I"""* the maintenance of a balance. When Canning suggested the â¢
*~^ "Monroe doctrine and it was adopted, he said that his sugges- i
tion had created a state that would maintain a balance in the \u25a0
Western hemisphere. Jiist now France is playing a double game, j
violating neutrality while pretending to observe itl She' is giving
Russia no less aid than if they were allies defensive and offensive.!
Without violation of French neutrality Rojestvensky would not I
have dared to go near the China Sea. What France has done is ,
entirety known to Japan. The Japanese have a thousand eyes pb- '
serving every movement* of the Russian fleet. In; every port of
Indo-China the Cochinese are observing what goes on, and the in- j
formation goes to Tokio. - â¢ j
This aid and comfort given to Russia by France is disquieting j
Germany and Great Britain. It is concluded in Europe that an
Asiatic state is necessary to preserve the balance in the Eastern
hemisphere. If two nations like Russia and France may covertly!
combine, the Eastern balance will be destroyed and the Portuguese, :
English and German interests in that quarter will be in jeopardy.
But with a strong Asiatic state, equipped for offense and defense. I
the balance will be kept, and one European nation will not live in
fear of being robtfed of what it has already stolen.
The aid given by France to the Russian fleet in so far as it
injures 'Japan is an influence unfriendly to the Eastern balance, arid'
Great Britain is especially distressed about it. If in spite of French
violation of neutrality Togo wipes out the Russian fleet^ Europe
would look on with much complacency while he took a lot of
French territory in- Indo-China, or while his Government enforced
against France the principles we established in making Great
Britain pay for fitting out Confederate cruisers. If instead of
building the. Alabama, in the Clyde, she had used a British port as
a base from which to attack our fleets or "prey upon ourVcommerce,
we would have had the same right of recovery. One ; is np)less a
breach of neutrality than the other. -^Tv,-
No doubt Japan is keeping tab on every act of France* and
there will' have to be an accounting. The attitude of Great* Â§ritain
shows a growing appreciation of the importance of the Japanese
alliance. and a determination to see fair : play,- to the -.en42PÂ£hat ! the
only Asiatic state. that can affect the Eastern balance shafl^femain"

BOTH-"HOW DREADFULS
r-NOLITIC\L conditions in this city cannot be made better by
h- 1 fitful efforts. Permanent reform was never effected by fits
* and starts. For several months past exciting events in the
realm of pushdom have called the attention of the people to what
is done in that kingdom of rascalry. The lid has been lifted and
the light has been turned on/ and as the people have looked at the
disclosures, running all the way from ballot-box stuffing, through
Legislative bribery to the stealing of taxes, they have girded them
to make things better. But this will be useless if it be a passing
impression. If the citizens do only temporary patrol duty the
rascals will run and hide. Every shadow will hold a lurking crim
inal or grafter. None will be in view. But if the patrol go home,
withdraw vigilance and report nothing doing, every shadow will
give up its grafter and the whole gang will be working the system
again within twenty-four hours. I
The hope of the push is in reform being sporadic, a sort of
periodic attack of conscience, while graft is endemic. Endemic
moral diseases, like those that are physical, are eradicable by a bet
terment of local conditions. They can be extirpated, and thinking
men in this city are beginning to feel a sort of scientific interest in
the process. The challenge has gone out from the citadel of graft.
The cleansers of politics are defied to come on. The captain of the
push has displayed his nerve and has backed into his corner. The
challenge has been accepted by the. Republican League. The issue
is joined and the battle is on.
Not all the grafters are in jail or hunting bondsmen. Those
that are are looked upon as martyrs to their fidelity to the system.
Can any good citizen read the .defaulting Tax Collector's estimate
of himself without being impressed? He says: "I was careful to
take only from the rich and the corporations, that could afford it."
Yet every dollar that he stole came not from the rich and the cor
porations, but from the people. Graft expects forgiveness if its
victims can afford the loss. Again, this Tax Collector said: "I j
was a good fellow and helped my friends." His friends were the
push, the deckhands of the system. They want t<D elect a man to
handle public money who will divide with them wfiat he steals and
be "a good fellow" in that base sense that seems to excuse this de
faulters crimes to his own conscience. What he reveals is a new
variety of graft. It is perfectly safe to elect a man to the custody ;
of public money who will steal and divide. He may get caught and j
he may be punished, but the grafters of the push who took the divi- j
dends of his thefts are entirely safe. |
It is the business of the Republican League to see that no more j
"good fellows"' of that brand get within reach of the public treasury !
or the handling of public moneys. If unrestrained and unwatched ,
the push will at the coming primary prepare for doing" right over j
again all that has been done by their tools, to be exposed by citizens
and punished by the courts. The members of the push are not ad
monished by the punishment of one or of many of them. Graft is to
them a business. To get caught and sent to jail is to them merely
a failure in business. They keep .right on, as a merchant keeps on j
though another merchant fail. Looking at it in that way, they will
continue in business just as long as they can control primaries and
keep the system afloat. If they are left in power, with perpetual
succession, it makes no difference how many are caught and pun- ;
ished. Graft and theft will go on just the same. -,i \u25a0 i
Now it makes a mighty difference whether a city administration â¢
is for or against thieves and grafters. When the administration
makes itself busy finding fault with the leaders of reform, hunting
for bad motives for a good action, and carping at the officers of the
law when they display some zeal, it may be honest itself, but it, is
giving aid and comfort to political burglary. Every grafter and
thief who waits and watches around the places of opportunity is
encouraged when the administration tries to take a fall out of an
earnest citizen or a zealous officer bent on doing his duty, no matter i
how disagreeable it may be made. ;"A',< i
Give us an administration which faces the other way* one that
says to the reformer, "Go on; if there be wrong, find it," and 'to the j
officer of the law. "If wrong be found, punish it," and in one year '
the city will be as free of grafters and public thieves as to-day it is ;
of cholera. Let this be accepted as a truth that none can dispute:!
an administration that is pushed into power by the push cannot |
cleanse a city. One that is voted into power by the people, over .the '
prostrate push, is the only administration that can be relied on to j
put the municipal government on a high plane, and keep it there.
This is the' only issue in the next election in this city. Shall an
administration be pushed in "or be voted in?
VIGILANCE IN: POLITICS.
"Is there not more soul culture in
motherhood and more I mental dis
cipline in delicious cooking and in the
artistic arrangement of a home than
there can possibly be In studying dead
languages and modern ologles? I
trust you will give' your views on the
two | ways of culture ?."
I am : glad ; to answer these timely
questions -of a. reader. The subject is
one which is agitating educators and
thinkers just* now as never before.
The world Is beginning to see that
knowledge, unless applied* and em
bodied. Is practically useless and
serves -as a handicap rather than a
means of "development to human be
ings. .
Regarding the higher education of
woman,, thoughtful minds are seeing
that unless she can bring her learn
ing to bear upon domestic problems,
unless she ~ employs -.her knowledge in
the Improvement of the home and the
better "rearing of children, her educa
tion profits I little. .Without question
these are the channels through which
the feminine intellect should express
itself .^\u25a0.^
No profession offers woman bo great
an opportunity for the employment of
her -highest abilities as that of
motherhood. The woman who has
"educated" herself to so lofty a plane
that she fails to see this is to be pitied,
for in the end it is herself she cheats.
Her culture serves only to make her
introspective, discontented, unhappy,
useless to the world.
When any. woman directs her entire
attention .to cultivating her intellect
and her tastes, without the' thought of
applying her. knowledge to human
problems, or of making herself a more
helpful individual thereby, . she Is
bound to become selfish and in a sense
superficial.
The best place for the application
of knowledge is the home. The most
brilliant opportunities for achievement
lie there. The training of children and
the management of _a home call for
talents of the highests order.
r"; Present. lndications to the contrary.
I ' believe women are- coming to see
this truth as never before. Paradox
ical as it may seem, that very "higher
education" which is turning the fem
inine mind away from domestic chan
nels is leading it back to them.
' The woman of to-day, because of
her awakened intelligence, can see
that motherhood is a science and that
she must train herself for it. A broad
er understanding, a- more Intimate as
sociation with the world, are undoubt
edly, helping the heretofore hampered
sex to see just. how mightily important
it is that the home should be pre
served.
The. old fashioned â¢ mother did not
need training, you remark. She fol
lowed hfr Instincts and she was right.
Very true. But the woman of the
present' represents another. step in the
evolution of ; the . sex. '.With the devel
opment of her, intellect/ her- reasoning
powers. Instinct "does hot serve her as
it formerly did... She must know. She
must understand: the, why and where
fore of things." *Thia is* as it should
be. We ' cannot but regard â¢ . present
conditions as an Inevitable phase in
the development^ "of woman and we
cannot but believe she will prove her
self . to be a better mother and home
maker for the freedom and" advance
ment, she has enjoyed.
There is no danger in higher edu
cation for women if women will but
apply it in the making 'of better
homes/ But danger does lie In wom
an's failure to do this. Let women
turn their talents and their culture to
the problem of reinstating the home
as an institution. Let; them employ
their education in the intelligent rear
ing of \u25a0children. .
There could _be no achievement
greater ,than this.

late last Saturday afternoon and the
testimony fully Justified his letter ask
ing for the removal of the acting Tax
Collector.
The assertion made by the Mayor
that he sent T. E. Atkinson to over
see the making tip of McCabe's bal
ance sheets Is denied by Foreman An
crews, and the testimony given by the
witnesses shows that the Mayor's "ex
pert" did no -such work. The letter
from Foreman Andrews to the Mayor,
published in yesterday's Call, is sub
stantiated in every particular. The
witnesses who were called yesterday
are Auditor Harry Baehr, â John R.
Smith, Douglas Young. John Lrlebert,
R. A. Miller, H. C Maguire. C. B. Per
kins and T. J. Tomalty.
The evidence collected on the Treas
urer's office by Foreman Andrews and
Expert Douglas Young was presented
to the Grand Jury, but it was decided
to postpone action upon it C. B. Per
kins and J. C. Tomalty of McDougald's
office were called to testify on the
methods of the department. C. F.
Baker of the Crocker-Woolworth
Bank was questioned regarding the
check for 515.690. which former
Chief Deputy Devoto cashed for the
absconder, Edward J. Smith. Fore-
Notwithstanding that Dr. H. Kuge
ler of 2210 Baker street displayed a tin
placard warning burglars off the
premises, his home was entered Tues
day night' and jewelry, coin and sil
verware valued at about $3000 stolen.
Had . the . crooks had more . time, they
would have made a much better haul,
and would probably have left nothing
more than wall paper, carpets and the
warning sign, -but the timely arrival
of the doctor interrupted their oper
ations and the housebreakers made
their escape.

BURGLARS MAKE
A HEAVY HAUL
Charles Follen McKim, who modest
ly bears the reputation of being
America's most noted architect and
who has gained^ considerable distinc
tion abroad, was a guest of honor at
a dinner given at the St Francis Hotel
last evening by Architect D. H. Burn
ham of Chicago, who invited to assist
him in entertaining Mr. -McKim about
forty of San Francisco's citizens that
are prominently identified with the
movement to. beautify the city. .
Mr. McKim, upon whom King Edward
of England two years ago bestowed a
royal_gold medal for his part, in the
promotion of architecture, and who
is also . president of the American In
stitute of Architects, \is visiting San
Francisco principally for: the purpose
of viewing Architect Burnham's partly
completed plans for the city's adorn
i ment, and this fact suggested to Archi
; tect Burnham the idea of giving San*
I Francisco's citizens, who are promot
ing. the splendid project, an opportun
; ity of meeting g the? : distinguished
visitor.' Among Â¥ those who enjoyed this
I privilege at last night's dinner were
j the following:

exert Uheir towards promot
ing schemes for; beautifying, the cities;
of their native land. .'At- the beginning
of his undertakings-Architect > : McKim;
figured that it would -require- at least
$1,000,000 and he has already raised
$800,000 of that amount.^ ' >/, \u25a0

NOTED ARCHITECT
GUEST AT DINNER
AMERICA'S MOST FAMOUS ARCHITECT GUEST OF BANQUET.:. WHERE HE
MEETS CITIZENS OF THIS CITY WHO ARE ENTHUSIASTICALLY PRO
MOTING THE ELABORATE PROJECT FOR ADORNMENT, OF THE CITY.
P. F. Hofman, a Newcastle merchant,
is at the Russ.
R. Richardson, a merchant of Sacra
mento, is staying at the California.
J. B. Scott, a druggist, of Salinas, is
in the city for a few days and regis
tered at the California.
A. L. Hawley, who is connected with
one of Seattle's financial institutions, is
staying at the St. Francis.
Lieutenants A. B. Clifford and W; H.
Smith, U. S. N., who are on their way
to Guam arrived at the Occidental yes
terday.
M. P. Dalton, a New York mining
man, who has been inspecting his prop
erties in this State, registered at the
St. Francis yesterday.
This afternoon Signor Lucchesi will
escort a party of friends aboard the
Umbria, the officers having gallantly
extended the courtesies of the ship.
Mr. and Mrs. William Wehner and
Miss Wehner are up from their coun
try home at Evergreen, Santa Clara
County, and have apartments - at the
St Francis.
Among the guests at the St. Francis
is Major Paul -Elm of the Sixth Pom
eranian' Infantry Regiment of Ger
many. The major is making a leisure
tour of this country.
Lieutenant Richard S. Douglass. U.
S. N., who has Just been detached from
the United States ship Alabama and
assigned to duty as aid to the Gov
ernor of the Island of Guam, arrived
from the East yesterday and is at the
Occidental.
PERSONAL.
The presence here, several days ago,
of J. P. Hall, general agent of the
passenger department of the. Santa Fe
Railway Company in Chicago, has been
followed by a persistent rumor to 'the
effect that he is to return here soon as
assistant general passenger agent,' and
that Hall's promotion is but a part of
Passenger Traffic Manager Nicholson's
plans for. a general overhauling of the
passenger department of the company
in this city.
Although no one here is prepared to
confirm the report, which is being
quietly discussed in the Santa Fe of
fice, it is said that Assistant General
Passenger Agent H. K. Gregory is to
be transferred to Los Angeles, and that
W. J. Black, general passenger agent
in Chicago and Topeka, will come to
San Francisco as assistant passenger
traffic manager.
The changes, it is said, are to be
be made in order to place the pas
senger department lon a footing with
the local freight department, which re
cently underwent a change, and will
also permit the traffic officials of the
company here to enjoy a ranking with
the officials of the Southern Pacific.
In other words, tie Santa Fe proposes
to do as the Southern Pacific did when
E. H. Harriman called J. C. Stubbs to
Chicago and bestowed, upon him the
title of traffic director, so that he might
rank with the higher officials in the ser
vice of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fe Railway.

Transferred *to a Place

Referential Treatment by
San Francisco Officer Sur
prises the St. Louisans
ST. LOUIS. May 10.â The defaulting
Tax Collector of San Francisco left St.
Iviuis to-nlffht at 10 o'clock over the
WabaFh Railroad on his way back to
the city he robbed. Detective E. J.
Wren of San Francisco had charge of
the nrlscmer, while Pinkerton Agent
Carter traveled in the same car. with
his watchful eyes centered on Smith.
Smith was unaware of the Pinkerton
roan's presence. The trio will travel to
Kansas City, where they will change
to the Banta Fe Railway and from
thence to California. The train arrives
in San Francisco at 10:30 o'clock Satur
day night. A week in the city Jail on
a diet of butterless bread and poorly
cooked meat and vegetables has had a
telling .effect on the once city office
holder of San Francisco.
When he was first arrested his cheeks
br>r e a semblance of health, but when
he departed to-night he was haggard
and worn, his face was pale, -while his-
Ehaking hands indicated the nervous
tension under which he larjprs. Before
leaving the city Smith made special
arrangements with Detective Wren for
time In which to prepare himself for
the trip in order to travel, not as a
convict and felon, but as a gentleman
tinder surveillance.
Four hours before the time his train
was to depart he was taken from his
cell in the Jail and to the Planter's Ho
tel, where he was given a Turkish bath.
He afterward -went to the barber shop
in the hotel, where his hair was
trimmed and his face shaved. From
the appearance of the prisoner and the
detectives as they walked around the
hotel lobby together it would never be
suspected that they were officers and
prisoner, but rather traveling compan
ions on the best of terms.
Having completed these arrange
ments, Smiih and Wren returned to
the Four Courts, and for the remain
der of the time, before their train de
parted, he sat in Chief Desmond's
office and chatted with the detective
and the Chief. When the hour neared
10 o'clock the prisoner and detective
jumped into a carriage and were driven
to the station.
That Smith was treated with so
much consideration at the hands of the
San Francisco officer was a matter of
much comment among the officers and
specials at headquarters. Prisoners be
ing taken away from the city are usu
ally handcuffed before leaving their
cells and are then given a ride in the
patrol wagon, an object for the curious.
Xo ehackles or handcuffs adorned
Smith's wristÃ, nor was there any
thing about the manner of the prisoner
or officer to indicate their relative
standing. \u25a0
Smith smoked his cigarettes inces
santly all day. and when boarding the
train insisted on securing a seat in the
smoking-car. He expressed a dread of
his greeting in San Francisco. "Every
Tom. Dick and Harry and every curi
osity seeker in the city, I presume,
will be there," he remarked before de
parting. He Inquired two or three
times concerning his wife and mother,
and when he learned they were both
in fair health he was much gratified.
He expressed confidence in being able
to secure bonds Immediately upon his
arrival in San Francisco and has great
faith in his brothers, who he states
will no doubt settle his defalcations
before the case ever reaches the courts.
Mrs. Hleman, who under the name
of Mrs. Bowie came to St. Louis to
meet Leona Brooks, left St. Louis yes
terday. She returned to Los Angeles,
and thence stated she Intended to go to
San Francisco. The Pinkerton agent
who returned with Detective Wren on
the train with Smith will take watch
alternately over the prisoner.

A surgeon and physician of Reeds -
ville. Pa., has found Grape-Nuts ,. so
nourishing . and strengthening that he
uses it as a supporting medium after
operations. He says:
"As a physician I take great pleasure
In using Grape-Nuts in my. family and
also recommend it to my patients
where a good strengthening food is re-
quired. . . â¢
"I find it particularly valuable in
c-onvalescence from run down and de-
pressed conditions. It . also does " well
as a supporting medium after surgical
operations.
"The fact that it In pre-digested
makes it an ideal food for 'sufferers
from indirection and dyspeptic condi-
tions. With the high: quality of the
food maintained, as has : always been
the case, I consider it an. ldeal food for i

United States Commissioner, Heacock's
court in the Spring Valley water-rate
case. The company's counsel,- ;M. : B.
Kellogg, was examining-; him'as to the
amount paid for^ the* capital I stock ;of
the,' old San Francisco City Water
Company.
Upon the payment to his slster-in- j
law of \ what r his* lawyers say was; "a
mere bagatelle," George ;D. Hoover,
less than a year ago a paper carrier in
impecunious circumstances, has come 1 "
into possession of the ; $200,000 estate of
his late wife^ whom he married Octo
ber 4, 1904. The case is an unusual one,'
involving two compromises " with Mrs."
Louise Bee, widow 'of ;the - late. Detec
tive; Bee, who first: litigated with; her
sister over the wealth * they inherited
from their \u25a0 father i and then contested
Hoover's' right tothe estate of his de
! ceased wife.
\ The - Gerlack building, on Stockton
['and O'Farrell' streets, was the object of
I the"Â« first contest; between;", the -sisters,
[the -late Mrs.' 'Hoover, (who [was: then
! Mrs. . Marie , E. -. Newlands - having â¢ been
; devised a larger Interest than Mrs. Bee.^
Finally , a . compromise waa â¢: reached !
and Mrs. Newlands paid JMrs^ Bee $50,-'
000 . and x the \u25a0 contest { dropped. The
j dispute ; over ' the property/ alienated the
I sisters, however,": and it Us * said there
! was never a' reconciliation. /*vi

v The reason for the dismissal of two

probably given in the Police Court
\u25a0when Jerome' Kenny, one of the "driv
ers at ' the, City^ Hall station; -is friedj on
a eharge ; of battery.- ; The warrant for
Kenny's arrest' was sworn * out , yester
day^by C. . C. Trade "before Police
Judge >. Fritz. * Trade was for fourteen
months a patrol wagon ;driver.J ;
It is alleged that Kenny -went; to Abe
Ruef and' trfld him' that Charles , Mc-
Marrow. and another driver^ had' made
in Trade's presence *an^ offensive re
mark about Ruef.- McMarrow and the
other driver were c a. few: days- later
relieved of their 'jobs. When Trade"
learned of their dismissal ;he,' \u25a0: it "' is
said, went to Ruef and > denied that
such a remark had been made in, his

him on the jaw. Kenny was arrested

Former Police Commissioner Harry ,
W. Hutton has confounded his enemies '
that chuckled when they heard that r
his late wife, Inez Sexton Hutton, who
died on April 25 last in Michigan, had
cut him off without a dollar in her will. i
Yesterday Hutton appeared at the pro- .
bate department of the office of the (
County Clerk and offered t for probate a
letter he says constitutes a legal will, >
in which his wife devises him practi- ,
cally all of her }?5.000 estate, and gives i
; little to those that were to receive all ]
under the terms of the former testa- j
ment The letter or will presented by i
Hutton is as follows:
GRAND RAPIDS. Dec. 20. 1903. |
My Dear Husband: I
I have never wrcnged you knowingly. If I S
have, then may my God forgive and pardon me. '
as I hop* he will, all my sins. I am very weak in >
human strength, but my soul strength is ell
firm and white and real. Oh! what I have suf- .
lered without your dear protection and care!
But I have been true to you in honor, Harry, -
and will until death.' I may be going Into the â¢
| lion's jaw. but I go brayeiy. hoping mother's '
i love will o'erehadow me and God's strength .
sustain me. . i
I am not a bad woman and never have bern, j
and I have loved you very tenderly, very truly. |
I have been - embittered by things that have â¢'
been told me about you, but, oh! many things j
I bave not believed and never will believe, j
God help me In this trying time of my life. I '
love you very dearly, and I will all to you with i
the exception of JIOOO apiece to- Bennett and
Edith and Anna May Sexton, my dead brother
Jsy'g little girl, after all my Just debts are paid.
God forgive my many sins and let me creep up
to his leet and reÂ«rt with dear Dr. Homer and
dear mother and Grandma Kellogg. Solemnly.
INEZ SEXTON HUTTON.
Mr. Rice has my bank check for $30.
The former testament under which
Hutton was disinherited was dated Au
gust 11, 1903, so the instrument pre
sented yesterday by Huttcn was' ex
ecuted more than four months later. In
the will of August . 11 -. Mrs. . Hutton de
vised her entire estate and her property j
to Edith May Raine, a. sister, who was
named sole executrix; Bennett R. Sex
ton, a brother, and Anna May : Sex-:
ton, daughter of a deceased brother, '
Jay Sexton. To her husband she left '
nothing, saying that she"- disinherited
him for just cause. That she experi
enced a change at ~ heart, however, is '
apparent by the language 'of the second j
instrument, presented for, probate yes- :
terday. .
The last months of Mrs. Hutfon's
residence with . her ; husband : were
marked by r stormy scenes , and , sensa
tional incidents. Early in 1903. Mrs.
Hutton left her . husband and fled to
Salt Lake, where she Joined some rela
taves. but Hutton followed and brought
her bacK to this city. Later, . however,
it is said with Huttcm's consent, she
went to Michigan, and . there death
overtook her. But before the summons
came ; it now appears that ; she grieved
that a misunderstanding ' should have
separated her- from her.: husband,? and
to show her repentance made her ' will
anew and gave him ; the bulk of her
worldly goods. â¢. â¢
Three burglaries have so far been
traced by Detectives Freel and Bunner
to A. M- Sobrantes, who was arrested
on "Sklonday evening, and it is expected
that there will be others. The burg
laries were committed at the resi
dences of Jules Aron, 174S Steiner
street, on April 29; Charles Bone, 1509
Webster street, on Hay 1, and E. A. .
Blodgett, 419 Lyon street, on May 5.
Articles found in Sobrantes' room
have been identified by the three vic
tims.
The woman with whom Sobrantes
had been living and who gave the
name of Annie Taylor has been iden
tified as Minnie Bauer, a married
woman. Sobrantes came here with
four or five others, who intended go
ing to the exposition at Portland to do
crooked work. Sobrantes met the
woman in a dance hall and became in
fatuated with her. The others left
for Portland, but he remained here.
When he spent all of his money he
began to rob people to keep him in
funds. The woman is still in prison,
but she will probably be discharged
to-day. .

JOTOtTS GROCERS FREE FROM CARE OF MEASURE AND WEIGHT, PLUNGE I
INTO WHIRL" OF GAYETT AT THEIR ANNUAL PICNIC. HELD AT I
SCHCETZEN PARK YESTERDAT. THEIR OUTING WAS SUCCESSFUL.;; U\
The Grocers' picnic; that was held at
Schuetzen Park yesterday, will remain
a happy memory for those who attend
ed. No more enjoyable outing could be
wished for and when the last train left
the park at sundown, the crowd that
filled it was fllled with satisfaction. The
various committees that worked so dili
gently for the success of the affair were
gratified at, the results. ,
Trains were run frequently to the
park and each one 'was crowded with
pleasure seekers, there being several
thousand people, in attendance. From
the time the boat left its pier fun
reigned. There were committees to look ,
after the welfare of the guests and all j
were well taken care of. ;
The weather conditions could not have
i been more favorable. The balmy cli- j
mate of Marin County was at its best
and the sweet fragrance'of .the coun- |
try did much to put the crowd in a'
happy mood.
A band' was at the pavilion to dis
course popular music while ; the gay '
throng danced. This was the- popular I
amusement. Old and young -enjoyed |
it alike and the band was kept busy i
throughout the day satisfying encores. I
The games were attractive and \ af
forded laughter as well as excitement.
The fat ladies' race set the crowd into
roars. Plenty of chances were offered
children and married folks to win valu-
I able prizes." *i^
j J. M. Sullivan and Ed Broderlck were
; kept busy selling paddles to those who
i were willing to try their, luck on the
I wheel. A country fair faker would be
[ashamed of himself if he were to try
to compete with the two grocers in sell
ing paddles. .
Special prizes were offered to mem
bers in shooting and bowling contests.
Clerks were also offered prizes in va
roius contests. Thousands of guesses
were cast by the ladies in their efforts
to win. The little ones were , given
enough candy, to keep the doctors. busy
for the next two weeks.
The following are the winners of the
various races and games: .

nothing to eat wfth them. Monday night they
spent in the boat without any protection

were gnawing at their vitals. They have both

OF OVERDUES
Two Vessels Are , Added to
Already Long Line of ;c
Non-Arrivals.
Craft Laden With Valuable
Cargo Never Spoken Aft
er Leaving This Port.
News Concerning the Where
abouts of Glenburn Is :
Anxiously Awaited.
Bale of Hay Breaks Leg;.
Samuel Horseman* was taken to the Harbor
Emergency Hospital yesterday suffering travel
a broken leg. Horseman stated that he w
walking down Davis etreet near a wag-on piled
up with hay. which was being unloaded. One
or the bales of hay clipped away from the
tackle and In Its descent to the fldewalk
struck him a hard blow, breaking his leg.
Horseman will be laid up for several week?.
Th* overdues are monopolizing: much
attention. Perhaps the vessel among
them that is being most keenly watched
is the British ship Glenburn. This \:es
pel is now en route from this port to
Liverpool and is 179 days out. She is
fully two months overdue. Since she
left this port she has never been
spoken. She has on board a valuable
cargo of merchandise, consisting prin
cipally of canned goods, of which sal
mon predominates; also much wine.
When the Glenburn left here she was
in first-class shape. She was well
found in every particular. A majority
of shipping men think she will show
up most any day. Nevertheless, her
reinsurance rate jumped up yesterday
from 75 per cent to 80 per cent. She
was built in 1576 at Glasgow. She is of
1476 tons burden. Her commander.
Captain Johnson, is well known In this
port as ft careful and able skipper.
Much speculation is rife as to what
has happened to her.
Two additions .were made to the
overdue list yesterday.
They are the Deccan, IS9 days from
New York to Hongkong, listed at 15
per cent, and the Aphrodite â now out
152 days from Hamburg to Guayaquil
at 15 per cent. . . - ;
The rate on the Gostwyck was ad
vanced yesterday from 75 per cent to
80 per cent. She Is 136 days out from
Iquique to Sydney. Others on the rein
surance list are the Agnes, out 181 days
from Shields, bound to Valparaiso. 80
per cent; Mog, 90 days out from De
merara to Liverpool, 90 per cent; Al
cinous, 146 days from Peru to Antwerp,
76 per cent; Pax. 125 days from Junin

REAi: ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
The* First District Court of Appeal*
of the State of California began yester
day its official career in open court
; with a decision on a small case and tha
| examination of thirty-nine applicants
! for admission to the bar. .Hon. Ralph C
Harrison is the Presiding Justice, and .
Justices J. A. Cooper and S. P. Hall tho
associates. The session began at 10
o'clock with: an address by Edward R.
Taylor, dean of \u25a0\u25a0 the Hastings College
of the: Law.*
following the speech . came the first
decision of the new court, granting tha
motion :of W. F." "Wllliamaon for a
dlmunltion . of record in the case of
Pease vs.* Fink. Immediately after tha
decision Clerk of the Court Johnson
read ~- a list \u25a0of the ' applicants for ad
mission to, the bar. There are thirty
nine names, and the examinations,
which began - yesterday, will contlnua
until Friday, night, when the names of
those admitted will be announced.
Dean Taylor in his address to Ihs
court spoke as follows:
If your Honors pleas*: Tb* Bar Association
of San - Francisco has very properly d*Â«med
thÂ« opening \u25a0of - this court .for th* first tlm*
under th* recently adopted amendment* to
th* State constitution an event of such great
importance as to warrant som* especial recog
nition of thÂ» occasion. They have accordingly
deputed mÂ« to appear her* at this time and
under your -Honors' privilege to make oa their
behalf som* appropriate remarks.
* COXGRATUIiATES JUSTICES.
In the ~: first ' place I congratulate you and
your confreres .in th* other districts en th*
; felicitous fortune that ha* befallen you in
I having been ' selected by th* Governor of th*
State to start- on their career these new courts,
whose creation > constitutes the most radical
and momentous event in th* Judicial history oÂ£
; the State. ,. It is Indeed a new departure, bat s>
departure ln.th* right direction, for It tsÂ»be
lieved by those who are qualified to Judge and
who have given . th* subject much thought for
a number of years that we hay* secured at
last an ideal Appellate system.
We have \u25a0in It not only a scientific division \u25a0
I of labor, ' but \u25a0 such divided Jurisdiction as b#
tween th* District and Supreme courts and
such flexibility in the distribution of business
among them : as must necessarily result wtxa
one* tho arrearage is disposed of in the Ap
pellate Courts keeping abreast of th* cases as
they arise. Th* appellate system as w* now
have It Is th* work of many hands and has -
first and last cost an infinitude of thought and
labor extending over more than a dozen years.
and this alone ought to glv* us th* best augury
for IU success,
W* \u25a0 are -her* witnessing a momentous) his
toric event. Indeed th* on* greatest thins
among human activities that can happen ia
California to-day is the opening of this court..
"W* have here another high instrumentality for
the administration of justice among men. How .
much -â¢ this means is easily recognized when
we consider that the civilization of a country
may be measured by the perfection of such In
strumentality.- Rom* was not at her highest
when her eagles sat gorged with the - spoils '
of a conquered world, but when the great body
of her law which had been developing for
centuries was In Justinian's tlm* bound to
gether In* the Â« unrivaled sheaf whose seed ha*
f ructtfled J the , ages.
SYSTEM IS NECESSARS.'.
The value iof an appellate system is not *
always appreciated at Its true value. In fact
when the contest was on for the establishment
of these very, courts many Intelligent persons
contended that .what we needed was lesw, "
rather than more, opportunities for appeal.
But this la an exceedingly superficial view; for
Independently of local influences and pre
judices more or les* unconsciously operatlns
upon - trial Judges an appellate, system is an
imperative necessity to the creation of an or- \u25a0
ganic system of law for the whole State. No
matter what differences of view there may bÂ»
between thÂ« various local Judges of the State,
the Appellate : Court that has the final word
settles all these differences and determines
what-' the> rule Is ' and how it shall operate
Thus,- some degree of certainty fÂ» reached and
the law -of \u25a0 the State' molded tnto an organic
whole. 'â¢ < 'VfnMÃ^isMSS|S^aqjh*Â«f)
~ Had the Supreme Court of th* United State*
not been ; gtven final 'Jurisdiction â¢oe Â»n con- -
stltutional questions. Instead of "oar havln?
but one constitution, as now. we would have -
had as many Federal constitutions as there
are : States *In . the -American union. * And so
with us. . But for our system of appeals, w*
would , have had our. State constitution mean
i Ing on* thing in one county and quite another
thing In another county, while land titles and
other â¢ things ;of nearly . as much importance
would ,have fallen Into uncertainty and con
fusion. . .
liAW , Or. PROTECTION".
The \u25a0- citizen Â£oes not ordinarily appreciate
what the law is and what It does for him. H*
doe* not." unless his attention Is specially called
to -It. see that; all that he has and enjoys he
owes to the law and to Its protection. It has
, given him : the rery form ana framework of his
1 governmentâ national." "Stat* and municipal
and not only that, but the spirit as well, which
animates this form and framework and makes
it for him the living, breathing thing which It
; Is; it makes tha difference between barbarism
and civilization;. between might and right- be
! tween. apprehension for safety of life and prop
! erty; and. assured reliance that both will b*
protected. "-flÃHÃSjswpiÃHÃNvatÃa
It covers him. as with an aegis, wheresoeve
he may.be and whatsoever h* may undertake.
By it - alon* ; can he safely conduct business)
; transactions; by It alon* can he forecast re
sults in his dealings ' with his fellow, man: by
it alon* he secures and keeps title and posses
sion Uo the' homestead which, shelters hlmsÂ«]Â£*
; and his loved ones; by It alon* h* obtains) com- '
pensation for. any: Injury h* may suffer to hi* '
personal property;. and by it alon* th* criminal
is justly punished and j tha wrongly aeenasd'
vindicated and. set free. In other words. It is
i the law, administered by. the courts, with ta* '

NEW TORK. May 10.â Prices reversed the
xnovMnent of yesterday aad sagged in a heavy
tcarket. The only significance which can be
â¢ ttached to the movement was the almost
total 'abstention from the dealings of any. real
fcoldrre of nocks .or any real seekers tor stock*.
Th* inability oflthe room traders to, get prices,
far away froai H given \ level . is the unfalUsg

m<*em* to be completed aad the supply Â«f
stocks is the market ts exceedingly small. It
Is eacy. therefore, when the trading element
takes the long eide to get prioes up as far 'as
thai element dares to carry the movement. On
the ether hand. Â»cy effort to market stocks.
even of a meaner aauxint. finds practically no
Oin&Dd and prices ecmaequentty run off e&sily.
Thus results the -wsveriEr-. -nncertaln ton-j
from day to day which sow distinguishes tb*
market. Aside from the technical evidences Â«f
the purely professional character of the trad
leC. the sfcrinklcff in tÂ£e vctaae of dealings If
clear evidence of the teaguid Interest no-w

Christmas there was a total of nr^y 289.00)
shares dealt la on the Stock Exchange owlnr

sonable absences frata Wall street. With that
exemption, it is necessary to gn back tÂ» thi

Cnd a par&Uel far to-day's amaJl business In

awaited with soa* rese<wÂ«d apprehension
which was shown "by the renewal of UÂ«h\

tone of pab'.lo addresses by. tht Presldeat aad
a leaÂ£lng member of his adxatnlstratloa served
to - shake the assurance . felt on this point.
Moa*y wss extremely easy, but sterling ex

Monday, as first announced, for an en

his -first Â» week - "Terence." a dramati
zation by Mrs. B. M. Croker's widely
read' 'novel.'- 'It is an' Irish comedy
drama .of- the present period, with
scenes laid in and near Dublin.-
DÂ«?spite its modern period, "Terence"
is built, upon the same, lines as- all of
Chauncey Olcbtt's plays. .The :last of
the" Desmonds has been. swindled put of
hls : estates, and has' returned from; a
supposed sc-ldier's death ,in. India' to
wrest them* from ' \u25a0- a â¢ rascally lawyer.
How he accomplishes; this arid \rins,
in addition, a.prettjv heiress, who loves
him . for-: \u25a0 himself - alone, \ despite â¢ the
coachman's whip,", is the gist of the
story. . There.' is the j self-sacrifice and
abnegation,'* this -time'- the -object: being
the good name .of the wedded and silly
sister of the~ ; girl the hero loves. It is
a pretty stcry,'; very,; prettily arid logi

BEGI^EVIi)ENCE:TOrDAY
Lively arguments were presented be
fore the Street Committee of the Board
of Supervisors yesterday as to whether
the Sutter street cars should be run by
cable, by trolley or the underground
conduit electric .system.
In support of the conduit- system
there was an influential array of citi
zens representing the Sutter Street Im
provement â¢â¢ Club, including ex-Mayor
James D. Phelan. Dr. Julius <-. Rosen
etlrn,. Hoxls:hton Sawyer/ Dr. George
W. Merritr. Rudolph Spreckels and'.Sig
Stern.
For the United Railroads there were
present Patrick Calhoun and Attorney
Tirey L. Ford and Arthur Holland.- ;
Supervisor Braunhart brought. \u25a0 the ;
opposing narties to a position where
they could meet the subject in tangible
iorm and practically caused Ford to
make a formal application to operate
the Sutter .street cars by an "overhead j
trolley system." : ; : ?> ; > â
General Ford then -addressed the
committee as follows:
FORD SPEAKS FOR COMPANY.
V. hi!c we . hive .not Boufht .this " hearlnK
trd indÂ«d cou<<3 'scarcely have ask*d ' tlils '
ecir.mittee to dt In thss matter, in the ab- .
t-tnr* of tome formal petition aÂ«klnif for
effiele! ,sctl,m by the Beard of- Supervisors,
yet I am tree 'to cay that we welcome It -and !
are rratrful for this opportunity to make
clear to thiÂ«- committee and through tnem'to
the hcncrabJe body of which they are a part,
the 'attitude and Intentions of the United
Railroads. \u25a0 . '\u25a0. .
Complaint i* made that the street car ser
vice on the to-calied Sutter street system
â¢hculd be improved. This we concede. - In
dÂ«<<3. the United Railroads socÂ« further and
cays that \u25a0 th^ entire syÂ«t?m should be re
cosstructed. p.nd it is the intention of the
United Railroad* to do that very thlnp. . Thres.
mode* of reconstruction have been suggested.
The overhead electric plan, the underground
electric pien and the | present cable i plan.
This matter has for more than a year had
the rmt t-areful and painstatinn attention of
the officer* of the comfMiny. After a most
exhaustive, careful and painstaking examina
tion of the severai mode? of cutmruclion they
hp.-.c at last reached their final and definite
ccnclusion in the premiscf.
The conditions which they flrd prevaiUng
here, the short time which thftir Iranehlsj
hae to run. the complexity of operation which
mould be introduced, and the fundamental need
for uniformity, are ani'ir.s the reasons that
have impelled the United Railroads to finally
and definitely abandon the further considera
tion of the underground electric plan.
TliÂ« conclusions reached by the . company,
concretely stated, are: FirÂ»t. that the Sutler
rtreet eyftem must be reconstructed, which
xncens tubstantially the building of a new
road; second that when reconstructed it niuit.
for the reasons uhlch I have Just stated.' be
operated either as a' cable or an overhead
trolley system. - . . ' -' ...
ISSUE IS CI,EAR.
The question then before this committee
at this time is a very plain. and simple one â
ehall the Sutter street system be cable- or
trolley? < . .
L*t me add at this point that the con
clusions reached by the United Raiiroads were
neither arbitrary nor capricious. They -were
the result of honest, careful, painstaking ex
â¢mination of a problem whose solution meant
much for the future, not only of the I'nlttd
Railroads but of the city of San Francisco.
Indeed, the interests of the company and
of the municipality are identical. Municipal .
growth demands the development of outlying'
districts. In thlÂ» Important work you will
find the T'nlted Railroads a faithful end in
terested elly. You want relief for your-con
gested centers. You want this for sanitary
reasons. Tr>u want It for moral reasons, and
-in this you need not be told the ;Unlted Rall
roats will actively support you.. You want
" rapid- and convenient means of transportation
from one part of the city to another and
this the I'nited Railroads is r.axious to pro
vidÂ». You -want facilities .for reaching the
remoter parts of the city, where . homes may
be easify and cheaply obtained. . and by this
means put a stop to trans-bay immigration.
Tbls last is a matter of more consequence
than . is ordinarily supposed. Any one . who
.has patched the recent de\-elopment of sub
urban towns and. the rapidly, multiplying
rr.ea!,,- of reaching them must be struck with
thÂ« thought that Pan Francisco Is not getting
\u25a0II that heJcngg -to- tier.' '-The Key- route to
Berkeley and OsVland. "recently Inaugurated,
