can you expect from a man getting a
salary of only $65 a month and handling
thousands of dollars a day. * I was

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19.â 1n defense
of her honor and after having repeat
edly warned her victim. Mrs. Joseph J.
Roach, wife of a commercial traveler
and an unusually handsome woman,
shot J. J. Laventhal in the- neck this
evening, indicting a wound which the
surgeons say is almost certain to prove
fatal. The snooting occurred at the
home of Mrs. Roach and was the result
of Laventhai's insane infatuation. For
months he has been persecuting Mrs.
Roach with his attentions. Once she
caused his arrest and he was heavily
flned,' but he continued to annoy her,
begging her lo get a divorce and marry
him. He even threatened to kill her.
Laventhal went to the woman's house
late this afternoon and demanded to
talk with her. She closed the "door in
his face, whereupon' he ran to . the
rear door, but 6he had locked that also.
Then he shouted that he . would force
an entrance through a window. and- she
replied that- if, ; fie ; did,shei;Would. shoot
him.' Laventhal -laughed at.her: threat
and proceeded- to open "a" window. Mrs.
Roach had armed herself with her hus
band's, revolver and twice warned Lav
enthal to go back- As he was climbing
over the window casing she "fired' and
he dropped to, the ground. Mrs. Roach
immediately telephoned to the police
telling what she had done. 1 She was
placed under arrest and will be J held
until the. result of Laventhal's wound
is determined.
The woman tells, a simple story.
"The law provides, that ;,a man may
defend - his life," she said, "and a
woman's honor is -more valuable to her
than life. Had I permitted him to en
ter the house it would have damned
me. I would shoot him again under
similar circumstances." : .

declare that If she were to say to her
self that shÂ» is well she could rise
from her. bed and walk. Organically
there Is nothing wrong with her, but
functionally she is all disordered.
The physicians did not say that Miss

MAN WITH OSSIFIED

Murder.
Epecial Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO,. Oct. 19. â Robert Gardner,
the "man with the ossified neck," who
asserted that hanging would not kill
him, was sentenced to-day to life im
prisonment for murder. In - Judge
Tuley's court he pleaded guilty of the
murder of Agnes Morrison last June.
The Judge Immediately passed sentence.
Gardner is a. sufferer from solidifica
tion of the bones and tissues of the
neck, a malady technically known as
ostia \u25a0 spondilitls. His neck is elon
gated and as hard to the touch as stone.
His attorney, William Buckner, de
clared that hanging would not kill him,
for, he said, the drop through the trap
door would not break his neck and the
constriction of the hangman's noose
would not strangle him.
Attorney Buckner's announcement of
this startling fact in court probably
saved the man from the gallows

MILK DEALERS ARE BROUGHT
BEFORE THE BAR OF JUSTICE.
THREE FINED FOR USE OF ADULTERANTS
Three milk dealers whose cases
had been in abeyance were fined
$25 each by Police Judge Caban
iss yesterday for using preservatives
in the milk sold by them. The
case of George C. Smart, charged
with using formaldehyde in milk
sold to Eugene Lent, was" put on
trial. Dr.' Hoffman told of the
sufferings of the Lent babies, who
drank the milk. Chemist Price
said it contained enough formalde
hyde to be dangerous.
Smart's Case Goes
On Before Judge
Cabaniss.
\u25a0 ;;, \u25a0 \u25a0 r
Doctor Tells \ How
the Lent Children
Suffered;
Chemist Says For

Pronounced.
Coal tar' dyes, formaldehyde and for
malin, poisonous compounds and drugs.
Â«o deleterious to human health . that
they are'graded as deadly poisons when
used 'in sufficient quantities, v are some
of the ingredients that dairymen(o|f this;
city -utilize* to^sophisticate and adulfeT-T
ate the "product ot their; cows^' before
the fluid reaches the consumer.
Such was the disclosure made yes
terday In Police Judge Cabaniss' cd|irt,
where a number of dairymen were at
the bar on charges. of selling tainted
milk. The accusations made by Eugene
Lent, an attorney, residing at 1050
Eddy street, -against George C. Smart,
proprietor of the New York Dairy, who,
the attorney charged, had sold impure
milk that Had caused the serious Ill
ness of little Frances and Ruth Lent,
his daughters, tended :to quicken- the
course of justice in the court. Cases of,
other milk dealers, that had been hang-
Ing fire since last summer, â¢ were dug
out of the calendar and forced to trial.
The result was that three men were
convicted ' and fined for pedd-ling the
stuff, while rapid progress was made
with the trial of Smart.
The trio who were found guilty of
"doping" their wares were John Buhle,
Henrie Cassies and Pierre Labouchere.
It was shown by testimony from Milk
Inspectors John Brodt and W. Lyden
that -Buhle arid. Cassies had been deal
ing out cream that was adulterated
with coal tar dyes, used to enrich the
color of the fluid and to give It a higher
commcrcialjvalue. Labouchere had con
tented himself. with tainting his dairy
product with formalin, which Is a com
mercial preparation of formaldehyde.
It is a statutory offense to use any. of
these drugs in, milk intended for, hu
man consumption. Judge Cabaniss fined
each 'man $25.
That is another result of Attorney
Lent's battle to, purify the milk,, to pro
tect his babies and. to compel the at
tention of the authorities of San Fran
cisco to the sophistication that is being
practiced upon a food which enters: so
largely into the diet of every human
being. Lent's stand In demanding a
prosecution was backed yesterday by
startling testimony ; from Dr.: L. H.
Hoffman, who attended the children,
and â¢ from Arthur F. Price of Thomas
Price & Son, chemists, who analyzed
aibottleful of Smart's milk and found
appreciable evidence of the presence
of formaldehyde.
The prosecuting parent lined up forces
for a vigorous contest in court. He ap
peared not only as, complaining witness,
but as attorney, flanking Attorney Will-:
lam P. Humphrey and Assistant District
Attorney James M. Hanley. . Smart > was
represented by Attorney E. D. -Knight.
Alexander G. McAdle, head; of the. United
States Weather Bureau in this 1 city,"
opened the prosecution, testifying ; that
October , 9, ; 10 and â¢ 11, days . on which the
alleged impure milk was delivered, were
warm ones, the warmest of the year, with
the exception, of two in JulyJand one in
September.' Judge. Cabaniss could not' see
the point of * the , testimony," and Attorney
Humphrey explained:
"One of the elements of proof : in - this
case is that formaldehyde .i s: a" preserva
tive. We desire to show the state of the
weather in that connection,; as milk sours
rapidly in .warm temperature." '.-./..

Mr. Takahira, the Japanese Minister,
to-night gave a statement to the Wash

which he says that Japan feels "great

FORESTERS END
THEIR SESSION
High Court Decides to Move
Business Headquarters of
Order to San Francisco
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 19.â The High
Court of the Independent Order of For
esters, in session at the State Capitol for
tbe past three days, completed its bus
iness late this afternoon and adjourned
to mwt in San Francisco next year. The
sessions to-day were executive and sev- |
eral important matters of legislation
were acted upon. The report of the com
mittee on the state of the organization
announcing the appointment of D. J.
Davis of Sacramento as second Supreme
Ccurt deputy was unanimously ap
proved.
An important item in the way of legis
lation was that transferring the business
headquarters of the order from Los An
Â£6les to San Francisco.
The High Court voted almost unani
mously against a proposal to dlsincor
pcrate. The advocates of disincorpora
tion had but a scant following.
Another important step takt-n was that
reducing the age entrance into the order
from U tt> 16 years.
The members of the companion courts
will be enabled henceforth to take out
Insurance rolicles from $250. to $5000, the
minimum being SSOQ heretofore.
The court adopted a resolution mak
ing disability claims payable In five year
ly payments instead of in a lump sum as
heretofore.
A new law wafe passed requiring appli
cants for admission into the order to
subscribe to the constitution before pre
senting themselves for examination at
the hands of the court physicians. Here
tofore the order haa allowed but SO per
cent on suicide claims, but through the
adoption of a resolution to-day claims of
this character will be paid up to sixty
per cent of the amount of the claim, held
by the suicide.
The High Court approved the action of
the Supreme Court in levying a per cap
ita tax of one cent & month on every
member of the order for the support of
the orphans' home at' Toronto, Canada.

CONTHOIi OF RAILROADS.
The extiaorUlnary development of.ifldustrial
ism dur.nj? the last half century has been due
to several causes, but above all to the revo
lution in the methods of transportation and
communication; that is. to steam and to elec
tricity to the railroad and the telegraph. Save
on the ocean or on lake* so large as to be prac
tically Inland seas, transportation by water
has wholly lost its old position of superiority
over transportation by land, while lnÃtead of
tbe old highways open to every ope on the
came terms, but of a very limited usefulness,
we have new highwaysâ railroadsâ which are
owned by Private corporations, and whlcn are
practically of unlimited, Instead of limited,
Vhe old laws and old customs, which were
Pdeuuate and proper to meet the old condl
tlcr.s need radical adjustment In order to meet
thett new condition*. The cardinal features
in these changed conditions are. rust, the fact
that the nÂ»w highwayâ the railwayâ ls. from
the commercial standpoint, of infinitely greater
mportance to our industrial life than was the
old highwayâ the wagon road: and second,
' that tliie n*w highwayâ the railwayâ ls in the
hands of private owners, whereas the old
highwayâ tbe wagon roadâ was* in the hands
of tbe State. The management of the new
highwayâ tha railroadâ or ratlwr of the Intri
cate web of rallrcad lines which cover, the
country, is a task infinitely more difficult,
more delicr.te and more important than the/
primitive easy task of acquiring or keepinÃ in
order the old highway, so that there is proper
ly no ar.alci.y whatever between the two cafes.
I do not believe In fpvernment ownership of j
anything which can with propriety be left In'
private harda. and. In particular. I should
most strenuously object to government owner
ship of the railroads- But I believe v.-lth
equal firmness that H is mit of the question
for the Government not to exercise n super
visory cud regulatory right over the railroads,
for It iÂ» vital to the well being of the public
that they ehouid be managed in a Bplrlt of
felrnes? and justice toward all the public.
Actual experience haÂ» shown that It Is not
possible to leave, the railroad* uncontrolled. -
Such * eystma. or rather such a lack' of sys
tem. I* fertile in abuses of every kind, and^
puts a premium upon unscrupulous and ruth
less cunning In railroad management, for there
are some big shipper* and some raJJrond man-,
apers who. are always willing to take unfair
advantace of their weaker competitors, and
they thereby force other tig shippers - and big
railroad imn who would like "to do decently
Into similar acts of wrong and Injustice, under
penalty of belns left behind in the race for
succecÃ.
Government snr>erviilon is needed quite as
much In the Interest of the big shipper and of
the railroad man who want* to- do rieht ai in
â¢the Interest of the email shipper and the con
rJir.tr. â¢
OITM.VE OF THE PLAN. \u25a0 â¢".;
What wn need Is to have some administra
tive body with ample power to forbid combina
tion that iÂ« hurtful to the public, and to
prrvent favoritism to on* individual at the
expense nf another. In other wordft, we waat
an administrative body wttn the power to Â»e
cure fair an 4 Juiit treatment a* among all
thlppem who uÂ»e the railroads â and all ship
per* have a rleht to use them. We must not
leav* the enforcement of such' a law merely
to the l>Â»i mt "Kin of Justice: it is out of the
question for tbe law department of the Gov
ernment to do what *houi4 be purely admin
istrative work. The Department of Justice Is
to Ktand behind and f<vop*ratÂ«: with the ad
mlnietratlve body, but th* administrative body

SPEAKS TO STUDENTS.*
A visit to the Senaiu cnauioer was made
for the purpose of having the President,
on behalf ot the North Carolina Literary
and Historical Society, present a hand
some $500 gold loving cup* studded with
North Carolina gems, tv John (J. Mc-
NeiU of Charlotte as a reward for hav
ing produced the best piece of literature
in the StatÂ« during the year. This cup is
given by Mrs. Lindsay Patterson of \\ in
ston. ' â¢
Particularly pleased was Mr. Roosevelt,
when, on . the handsome lawn of Dr. C.
W. Burkett of the State Agricultural and
Mechanical Collage, he saw a big picture
of himself thus inscribed :\u25a0 "Welcome to
our President, who dares to do right, wlro
dares to be_ true, who dares to do that
which no other can do."
At 'Durham, where a stop of ten min
utes was made, the President devoted his
remarks to the students of Trinity Col
lepe, who were gathered in force to meet
him. A flat car had been converted into
v gayly decorated atand, and from this
the President spoke. He was accompa
nied to the stand by Lieutenant Governor
Winston, who otticiated at Raleigh, owm^,"
to the absence of Governor Gienn, eau-sed
by the death of his brother. Both United
States Senators Simmons and Overman
also accompanied 1 the President. Both
Senators are graduates of this college.
In tho course of his remarks to the stu
dents the President said:
ThÂ»re must be no coercion of opinion if col
leg.ate training- is to bring forth full Iruit.
You m*n of thi6 college, you men turoughout
the South who have nad collegiate tramltix.
you men throughout the Union who have had

of leadtrship from the men to whom inucn
has been given in the way of collegiate edu
cation. I'ou are not tntitled to any special
privileges, but you are entitled to be htld to
a peculiar accountab.liiy; you have earned the
right to be held responsible for what you uo.
Each one of you. if he is worth his salt, wish.s
when he graduates to pay some portion of me
debt due to his aima mater. You have received
from her during your yearÃ of attendance Iq
her halls certain privilege in the way ot

which makes It Incumbent upon you to lepay

You cannot repay that, to the colleges sa%-e
In one way. By the quality of your citizen

The little ones made, a pretty- sight,
waving tiny American flags as the train
came toa stop?
The President's train arrived at Char
lotte,' over^the Southern Railway, at
7:10 o'clock on schedule time, and dur
ing the thirty minutes of hia atny here
this evening he had from 25,000 peo
ple a reception of the most enthusiastic
character. Throughout a brilliantly
lighted street he was rapidly conveyed
in a motor teart car for four blocks to Vance
Park, where he spoke for rlfteen min
utes, although he had intended to speak
but, ten. .
The crowd was so .r. great - that fully
10,000 were denied the privilege .of
hearing him. The President; created
the wildest enthusiasm by referring to
the Mecklenburg declaration of inde
pendence and Mrs. S. C. Jackson, widow
of General Stonewall; Jackson, and
Lieutenant William E. Shipp, *a' monu
ment; of whom he passed en route to
the park.
The feature of his visit was his
meeting with thÂ« widow of the great
Confederate leader. Mrs. Jackson lives

manifested by such symptoms as I found
in the children." â¢
"Is formaldehyde ' the only substance
used In food products that would produce
such symptoms?'^ asked Attorney Knight
on cross-examination.
"No, sir," replied the physician.
"Do you know what quantity is neces
gary to produce such symptoms?"
"That would depend upon the suscepti
bility of the patient,!'.' was* the answer.
"Have you any. knowledge as to the
quantity used in food products?" ,
."It is not lobe used in food products.,"
declared Dr. Hoffman, and he sub
sequently explained this to mean, in a
medical s^nse. He was not informed
concerning commercial useÂ§ of the drug.
"What is : formaldehyde used for by
medical men?", miened the attorney.
"As a disinfectant, as a germicide^ and
to prt-serve anatomical specimens," re
sponded Dr. Hoffman. He added:
"It is used to arrest decomposition.
Taken in sufficient quantity it would pro
duce death in a human being. It would
act as a poison. Formaldehyde might act
on the tissues so as to cause a permanent
stomach and Intestinal disorder."
Eugene Lent related how he had
trouble a year and a half ago with
Smart's milk, how the dairyman had
called on him and explained tnat he
had bought some milk outside of his
own dairy and.it was this that caused
the dilhculty. Lent Identified a Dottle
of milk in which was blown the
words, "New York Dairy, George C.
Smart, proprietor," as one he had re
ceived from his domestic, and had
taken to Tnomas Price & Son for
analysis after his children had been
stricken. â¢ - '
"How long have you been taking
milk from Smar.t?" asked Attorney
Knight.
"About live or six years." said Lent.
"We object to this," interjected
Humphrey.
. "Well, there's a nigger in the fence,
here somewhere and we believe It's in
Lent's hoii3e," declared Knight.
The attorneys wrangled over the in
sinuation until Knight withdrew ithu
comment.
Miss Jennie Scullin. a trim young
woman, resplendent in a lace bonnet,
Identified the milk bottle and ,Fred
I'msen, a driver for Smart, admitted* he
served the Lents.
Then came Arthur F. Price, the
chemist, who, with a coldly profession
al touch, narrated his labora-torical ex
periences with the milk, saying:
CHEaiiST I'UICE MAKES TEST.
"I made a chemical analysis of the
milk, looking specially for preserva
tives. I found formaldehyde present.
That the analysis might be certain I
made three tests. Each one was a con
firmatory one for formaldehyde.
"This drug," continued Price in reply
to Humphrey's questions, "is used as a
preservative. It. would for a time pre
vent fermentation. In many samples
of milk I have tested the fluid sours
in,a few days. I have never been able
.to detect the odor of formaldehyde in
milk. It shows neither odor,'color, nor
taste in the fluid. The test in this case
was entirely qualitative, no attempt be
ing made to determine the' quantity.
Formalin Is the commercial form of
formaldehyde* being af4o? percent so
lution of the drug." t, '
On cross-examination [ Price denied
he had,said there was only a trace of
formaldehyde found in the milk. He
declared that the chemical reaction
was very distinct.
"There was more than a trace." ex
plained the chemist. "If only a trace
had been found I should have given
the milk the benefit of the doubt."
"Li's a good cow that gives 'milk'
these days," commented Judge Caban
iss in a stage whisper.
For the defense James Graham, a
driver for Smart, explained the rou
tine of handling the milk at the dairy.
George T.-Smart, son of the defendant
and foreman of the dairy, denied that
he had ever used any formalin or for
maldehyde at the dairy. He said he
did not think .the milk required such
treatment, owing to", its freshness
when delivered to customers.
DENIES USING DRUGS.
"Nothing of the kind was ever used at
my dairy," vehemently announced George
I C. Smart, the defendant, in reply to his
[attorney's question" about the drugs. "1
wouldn't know what the stuff was if 1
saw it. The milk is drawn from-the re
ceiving tanks, pure and unadulterated, is
put in the bottles that way, and so far
as I know is delivered that way. The
only persons in ray employ who could
fool with tho milk are the drivers, and I
do not believe they would do that. 1
have been in the dairy business for forty
years. Samples of my milk have been
frequently taken by the Board of
Health." -
Objection brought forth a statement,

LITTLE GIRL
A MURDERESS
Young Jasper Jennings Con
fesses That Sister Shot
and Killed Their Father
GRANTS PASS. Ore., Oct. 19.â Jasper
Jennings, the boy who has been confined
in Josephine County jail for the. past
month to await trial for the murder ot
his father, made a full confession to-day-
He declares his own Innocence, and say*
his twelve-year-old sister Dora committed
the crime. The girl Is In the Jackson
County Jail at Jacksonville. , Sheriff Lewis
has gone there. to Interview her and at
tempt to secure a confession from her.
The boy says his sister killed their
father because she hated him. On tba
night of the murder the family was vx>
till late, but after the father retired th-=Â»
girl slipped out through the darkness and
stole her brother's rifle from the cabin
occupied by him In Granite Hill mining
camp. Then she returned home and shoe
her father -while he lay sleeping. Hiding
the rifle in a thicket behind .the houso
she returned to bed, sleeping in the lanw
room in which her murdered parent lay.
The boy's story Is not believed entirely,
as the officers are of the opinion that h-Â»
is trying to shift all blame en his sister.
His confession, however, will serve to
bring a complete solution of the mystery
that has baffled the prosecuting attorney
and officers since the discovery of ths
crime, two* months ago.PORTALS OF CENTURY CLUB HOUSE

Large Crowd Walks Behind
the Hearse as It Passes
Through Streets of London
LONDON, Oct. 19.â The ashes of Sir
Henry Irving, inclosed, in a plain oaken
coffin, are now lying in the Chapel' of St.
Faith, Westminster Abbey, \u25a0waiting to
morrow's elaborate ceremony of interment
In poets' corner. Their removal from the
residence of Baroness Burdett-Coutts,
which waa guarded by a large force of
police, took place this evening.
The* coffin was placed in a hearse pre
ceded by mounted police and followed by
one carriage, the occupants of which were
the two sons of the deceased and Sir
Henry's aged dresser, Warden Collins,
who had been his attendant for half a
century. This modest procession was fol
lowed by another squad of mounted po
lice. The entire route to the Abbey was
lined by thousands of persons. The t men,
standing bareheaded, waited in respect
ful silence until the hearse passed, and
then joined in the procession behind the
police. Cn arrival at the Abbey the en
tire square was filled with a hatless mul
titude. The hearse was driven into the
Dean's yard, where it was met by the
Dean- of Westminster ana a number of
clergy. \,
The scene was most Impressive as the
procession moved- and disappeared among
the gloomy, time-worn cloisters. The
silence was broken only by the foot
falls of the clergy and bearers. The
public was not admitted to the Abbey.
As the procession entered the great organ
softly played the dead march from "Saul"
until the chapel of St. Faith was reached
and thetcoffln had been placed on a cata
falque. When the music stopped a short
prayer was said by the Dean. /
An open grave in poets' corner awaits
to-morrow's ceremony. It Is lined with
heavy black cloth, which also carpets the
floor for a distance of several yards. The
wajls of the chapel are banked with great
piles of floral tributes.
For hours to-day a constant stream
of people filed past the" casket as it rested
in the dining-room of the house of
Baroness Burdett-Coutts. Burning tapers
surrounded the catafalque, and the
wealth of floral tributes, American and
Continental as well as British, was so
great that the catafalque was not only
hidden, but floral offerings lined the bases
of the walls of the spacious apartment.

Schmitz and Partridge Men Crowd About
Candidate as He Leaves^Hali to
Prevent Possible Assault.
Thugs and Rowdies i?i the Gallery Hurl
Obscene Language at the Speaker
and Women Leave Hall.
â¢"Hooray for Ruef!" yelled the hood
lums In tlie grailery at Garibaldi Hall,
in tbc Forty-fourth District, last night
at the meeting of the citizens of the
Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth districts
to listen to John S. Partridge. The cry
was taken up by several men at the
back oi tne nail downstairs, but two
thirds of those seated wore the Part
ridge button, while the remainder wore
the bctimitr emblem. These repre
seniea the best element of the district
&n<i tne Schmitz men joined with the
others in the cry to have the disturbers
tnrown out.
Cheering for Ruef was not the only
feature ot the evening. Threats against
the candidate, obscene cries and jeers
greeted Mr. Partridge and every ef
fort was made to break down the
sptaker and drive him from the plat
form. "You're a scab! You're a
bum. You're an ex-convict I" yelled the
crowd, and the candidate's face went
white, but not with fear, at one par
ticularly cowardly insult from a loafer
in the gallery. The epithets hurled at
tile speaker became so foui that ladies
in the hall arose and left the building.
Could any sane man who is at pres
ent in doubt as to how his vote will
go j have been present last night and
witnessed the exhibition made by the
Ruef ruffians of the Forty-fifth in
laeir attempt to break up a peaceable
gathering, there is no question that
their votes would go to Partridge.
The leaders of the disturbance in the
gallery showed plainly that they recog
nized that Ruef Is the man for whom
they are working and that Schmitz is
(he merest tool of the boss.
lICHL,S> OUSCEM2 \VOltl)>.
That tlie liltny language ana obscene
yells of the Ruefters gained for Part
ridge "the votes of many ot the decent
wearers of vie Schmitz button is un
douutedly true. Some Schmitz men
were loud in their cries to throw the
loafers out and give the speakers a
lair hearing. The Police Department
will no doubt receive a lengthy letter
of approval from Kuef at the elaborate
ly pianned absence of policemen at the
hall, not one being detailed to the
meeting. Well did Ruefs lieutenants
oa the Police Board obey the bidding
of their master.
Nothing daunted by his reception, the
fusion candidate, after being intro
duced by G. Malpiede. the presiding of
ficer, faced his detractors and hurled
defiance into their faces in a way that
brought his supporters in the audience
to their feet with hysterical cheering.
"I am glad," exclaimed Mr. Partridge,
addressing the ruffians, "that you are
here representing my opponents, be
ca-us-e you are the kind of men 1 want
to talk to. You may be against me, but
at least, boys, give me a fair show."
"You're a dirty scab: You're a dirty
bum!" howled the Ruefters.
"You are the kind of men, you there
in the galleries, that I want to talk to,"
continued Partridge, as the shouting
ceased. "I want you to hear this one
thing if you don't hear another word
to-night: You can't^bluff me; you can't
drive me out of the tight by shouting
or by physical violence. We've got you
be*ten, and by the living God we'll
roll up 15.000 majority on election day."
PARTRIDGE AOT COWED.
"You're a liar. You're an ex-con
vict:" yelled the galleries. Then came
the insult that drove the blood from the
speaker's face and caused the women to
leave the hall.
"You're not going to win by such
work as that," cried Partridge above
the tumult. "You can't win this fight
by tearing down signs and breaking up
meetings. You are not going to vrln
this fight at all, for you're beaten, and
no one knows It better than Aba Ruef."
Partridge continued his speech, Ih-

of San Francisco.
But this tamy zeal isn't going to save him.

It's only a question of majorities Hjw,, w 1
am going to talk a moment to the thousands
of honest union labor men who are since; el>
supporting this administration. I want to tell
them a few plain facts, co that they o*n jidge
for themselves whether they are ju?t.3ed in
that support.
I pa:^ by the fact that there are very few
unicn labor men on any of the commiVpions
or in the efflces under the commissions whl.'h
pay good sauries. I pass by the fact thai
there are so few union men on the Unljn
Labor ticket, and even some who have b.-en
In the past actively hostile to union men.
Those are matters which pertain to thÂ»
spoils alone, and I <Jo not believe that i. Ny
honest union man is concerned about the rpjils.
MAYOR NOT SINCERE.
It is more important to determine whsther
or not the Mayor is sincere in his attitu !e
toward labor. Let's take the two prlac.pj.l
demands made upon him. When the termâof
I>. I. Mahoney as Police Commissioner tt
plred thousands of union men petitioned t.iÂ»
Mayor to reappolnt him. But thÂ« Mayor re
fused and appointed John A. Drinkhouse. who.
as Public AdmlnUtrator. had been a client
of Mr. Ruef. Then, after this gentleman had
served for awhile, the Clgarmakers" Union
charged that he was using his office to com
pel the retail liquor men to handle non-union
cir&r*. They proved their charge and de
manded the removal of Mr. Drinkhouse. Again
the Mayor rerused. It it not reasonable, jf
the Mayor was false to union labor In thos*
particulars, to doubt the sincerity of all hU
protestations?
But even the question of hie sincerity is
not rhe moit important. The real point is to
determine whether or not* the nun and women
who toil are suffering from the misdeeds of
the administration.
I take it that the union labor roan is first
of all a citizen, and as such wants to see
rood eovernment. I know many of them
personally iÂ»nd that is their attitude. But
can that government be called good whe.-t
scÂ£ndal follows scandal, and where the very
air is filled with tales of Its debauchery*!
Above all. ran that government be cail. d
good which trifles with the health and lives
or the people? ,
Take the case of the emergency hospitals.
The great majority of the men who are taken
there are worklngmen. who are Injured in the
course of their employment. Yet dunng this
administration the hospitals have be?n a hot
bed of scandal, and I am reliably Informed
that condit ors have become so bad that In
jured teople have refused to be taken therÂ«
for treatment.
DILLON'S ARRAIGNMENT.
But the worst arraignment of all was the
r peech of Dr. Dillon In Pioneer Hall the other
night. He speaks as one who has *een things

said that when he wa a a health officer under

Woodruff, Fred Eggers and John A. McGea.
General Woodruff told of the stand of fusion
in the' lnterests of the true laboring man, and
eaid . that the element supporting Schmitz .ln
the<*tenderloln is composed , of the worst ene
mies otm labor. McQees remarks were also an
illustration of the methods of the Mayor ln
rtgard to the removal of union men frcm thÂ«
oittclal positions and the substitution -of
grafters.
Fred Eggcrs made a forceful talk regarding
the work in the Board of Supervisors and its
action in voting money for the Mayor to put
to public use. but which BtiU lies ln the city
treasury. In particular he referred to the
appropriation for the paving of the Mission
road to the county line and the widening ot
Fourth street, from Market to Townsend.
Cheers and applause greeted Mr. Partridge,
who spoke in part as follows:
\VI LI, API'OIA T GOOD MEX.
The manner in which the campaign is being
coucauc-ttu ia a fortunate circumstance. ThÂ«
whole people are making my fight, and so I
fain, uiiuc.l' obusatioub io vie c.nok. people,
'incse ODiifiations 1 can only repay Dy appoint
ing to otuce men who will worK ror the inter
ests oi ail classes. I repeat again, it is a
hopeful *ign when a candidate can make a
ngnt like tnis, with no promises except to the
people. Â»
.-\*,ain, I say, no man can really do justice
to the office of Mayor under present condi
tions, unions be knows politics thoroughly,
xi makto no dmetence whoint-r baa men are
put on the commission's for corrupt purposes,
or whether they are appointed through Igno
rance ot' their real character. I have been ia
politics for twelve years here in San Francisco,
have been on the county committee for half
mat time, have been, on campaign committees
several times, and have been chairman ot two
conventions, Â«nd 1 think I know the anteced
ents and character of every man who has ever
had any connection with politics. Above all,
I have made three fights against Abraham
Ruef.
To be against Mr. Ruef is a liberal educa
tion ln municipal government. To be abused
by Mr. Uuet is a gilt-edged character certifi
cate. â¢
Again, it may be asked what special train-
Ing X have had for the high oltlce lor which I
have been nominated. Study of civil govern
ment and history in a great university is some
preparation. Four years as teacher ln the
public schools makes a man familiar with the
needs of that department. The study and
practice of the law is closely connected with
the study and practice of the sceience of muni
cipal affairs. But I know of no place where
a man acquires so rapidly and thoroughly a
complete knowledge of the whole civic ma
chinery as ln the City Attorney's office.
The charter makes the City Attorney the ad
viser and. counselor of every department of
the .city government. Every conceivable ques
tion conn*ct*-d with ' the city's affairs is re
ferred to his office for Investigation. He stands
in the dual capacity of an advocate anil a
judge. An advocate, when any official or
commission Is sued, or when the city itself
must bring an action, and a judge,- when any
official or commission is ln doubt, . I
In connection with my work in this office
I have become familiar with the details and
Inner workings of every part of the municipal
government. I have been obliged to familiar
ize myself with the charter, the ordinances of
the Board of Supervisors, the decisions of the
courts and -the general statutes of the State of
California which pertain to the conduct of
affairs in San Franclseo.
AX IMPORTAXT PROBLEM.
But my principal work has been ln connec
tion with the case of the Spring Valley Water
Company against San Francisco. The law of
that case Is complicated enough. Involving, as
it acts, the whole subject oi the relation of
public service corporations to the people. I
consider that problem the most Important with
which the American people have to deal at
the present time, for it Is not only a legal
problem, but a social and economic one as
well. , It is a problem with which the people
of Ban Francisco must have much to do in the
next few years, and (it must be dealt with
fairly and impartially, without passion or pre
judice, and above all it must be. dealt with
Intelligently. It is a big problem, requiring
very special knowledge, and It cannot be han
dled by declamation. In connection with it I
have read every decision of every court ln
America, every work of the political econo
mists, and every Government report. I would
like to take every one of you into the oifice
and show you how we have systematized all
that special knowledge, and put It in such
form that lt will be readily available for all
time.
Now I do not want you to think that I am
claiming any credit, or asking any considera
tion or reward for this work. It was my plain
duty, and besides, lt wae a labor of love. I
only cite H to show you that I am not unpre
pared for the work of the city government,
and so you may judge from my pa*t Whether
or not I will be industrious and faithful In the
public service.

Commissioners Excites; *â¢ 'â¢%
SusDicion i
The Registrar of Voters and Election
Commissioners know that- the petitions
recently filed for placing Schmitz on the
ballot as the "Independent Republican"
nominee and "Independent Democratic"
nominee are tainted with fraud. It Is re
ported that two of the Commissionersâ
Lefflngwell and Devotoâ are read; now
to take the orders of Ruef and recog
nize the petitions as legal.
E. F. Threadwell, attorney for the Re
publican and Democratic parties, is ready
to bring the matter to the attention of
the Supreme Court. He is prepared to
take the Owl train for Los Angeles im
mediately and ask the court in session
there for a. writ of mandate returnable
in this city one day nextÂ« week. Perhaps
the Commissioners will attempt to dodge
the issue by holding back the order to
recognize the petitions until the last day
of grace. The fact that Registrar Adams
received the petition, stamping each doc
ument with his official stamp, may be ac
cepted as proof that the Board Si Elec
tion Commissioners has actually advised
that the law be ignored and set aside.
The citizens of San Francisco, Republi
cans and Democrats, know their rights
under the law, and will appeal to the
courts to prevent the ; perpetration Of
fraud by Ruef's creatures on the Board
of Election Commissioners. It Is known
that tne grafters have a firm grasp on
several of the municipal boards, but the
gangsters have not succeeded in getting
COMMISSION FAVORS PLACING
RUMP NOMINEES ON THE TICKET
Election Board Seems Already Decided
After hearing arguments' for and
against the placing of the nominees of
the -so-called Independent Republican
and Independent Democrats on the of
clal ballot, the Election Commission de
cided yesterday that no action could be
taken'until Registrar Adams had re
ported as to whether the signatures to
the petitions were bona v flde, in that
the signers had'hot voted at *the' last
primary 'election.! Adams stated that
the number of signers exceeded 3 per
cent of the votes polled at the last
election, as required by law, but he
had not had time to ascertain If they
were legally entitled to sign the pe
titions.
Attorney Treadwell raised the point
that the law did not contemplate that
the nominees of one party should be
put on the ballot under the designation
of another party. He said that the so
called Independent Republican and
Democratic ' candidates had already
been nominated on the Union Labor
ticket, and to put them on two other

XEW YORK, Oct. 19.â Charles T. Mur
phy, in denying some of the allegations
which District Attorney .Wlt.iam T. Je
rome made in a speech last night at
Carnegie Hall, said to-day:
Mr. Jerome said he never asked for in
dorsement by any political party. Mr. Jerome
asked a confidential friend to see me on two
or three occasions on hla own behalf. He said
that he was anxious to meet me and to have
a distinct understanding with me. He even
agreed to Join the Tammany Hall general com
mltte*. If Jerome denies this before the meet-
Ing here to-night we will prove the truth of
It from the platform then.
In reply to these statements Mr. Je
rome said to-day:
I deny it. Let him prove it from the plat
form.* But I will not say he did not send, a
messenger to me.
Jerome > to-night continued the vigor
ous independent campaign he is making
for re-election to the office of District
Attorney. Jerome spoke first to a great
crowd gathered in Murray Hill Lyceum
and 'later addressed ' an enthusiastic - au
dience which tested the capacity of : the
Grand Central Palace on the East Side.
Jerome's principal address was at*the Ly
ceum, where he dismissed with the brief
statement, "It is not true"; the charge
made by Charles F. Murphy, that Jerome
had sought him in connection with the
Democratic nomination. The District At
torney then attacked fiercely the present
Democratic administration and the nom
inees. He was most bitter against Mur
phy and compared "-him ' disparagingly
with Richard Croker, ."a real , man, a
man with a jaw, a . man that : stood .up
and never lied to a friend; a man who
stood good and true when he gave you
! his word and told you he would or he
would not, and then did as he said.
Croker was my friend, though I' fought
i him for twenty years. That kind of man
I could deal with, not the miserable kind
of a\nan .from Good Ground." He con
tinued:

control was threatened at the last gen

tions for Judges of the Superior Court de
feated the gang.
The right of a petition for a place on
the ballot is provided by law to enable
voters to vote for a man who is not tha
nominee of a party . convention. Eugene
E. Schmitz is the nominee of the Union
Labor party convention and as such his
name goes on the official ballot. He did
not apply to any other convention for a
nomination and therefore was not de
nied. * .
Nominees of the Republican party are
entitled under the law to the leading posi
tion on the ballot as, that party cast the
highest vote of all the political parties
at the last election . for Governor. The
law in this respect is clear and distinct.
Yet the Election Commissioners will
break the law or juggle with it, at Ruef's
command.
Ruef runs the administration. He gives
his orders to Schmitz and the Mayor dare
not disobey the boss. Ruef detailed the
chief clerk of his own law oflice for duty
in the Mayor's office aa private secretary,
so that the boss would have knowledge of
all transactions in the executive depart
ment of the municipal government. Wage

SCHMITZ HOLDS FIRST
MEETING IN OPEN AIR
Mayor and Other Candidates Speak During
the Noon Hour at the Union Iron Works.
Mayor Schmitz began his series of open
air meetings yesterday when he ad
dressed the workmen of the Union Iron
â¢Works. With the Mayor were many of
the \u25a0 nominees of the Union Labor party
and they were all Introduced to
the noonday assemblage. He spoke
shortly on the issues of the cam
paign and "gave ~ as" one result
of his ' administration the estab
lishing of the Potrero Emergency Hos
pital for the benefit of those who were
injured at the works. At the conclusion
of his address he was presented with
a large floral piece made of roses and
fern, the gift of the Boilermakers' and
Shipbuilders' Union. The presentation
speech was made by Thomas Egan.
Mayor Schmitz is not wearying in his
fight for his chair and the success of the
ticket upon which. he stands. Every day
sees an increase in the number of the
meetings at which he speaks. His voice
has nearly recovered from the strain of
the first week and once more the Mayor's
vigorous tones can be heard in every part
of even the largest of the halls. Last
night he addressed six gatherings in vari
ous sections of the city. The first was at
Potrero Opera House, Tennessee street.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
RENO. Nev., Oct. 19. â Smarting under
the action of the body of citizens who
moved the Sparks postofflce from Its
location last night, residents of the
city who live ln the vicinity from
which the office was moved have an
nounced their Intention of moving lt
back to Its original location. That
their proposed action will be met with
a strong resistance is certain, as a ma
jority of the citizens are in favor of
the new location. The action of the
people last night took a majority of the
citizens by surprise and they were at a
where a great crowd wa3 gathered.
Nearly all cf the candidates of the Union
Labor ticket appeared on the platrorin
and spoke a few words.
â¢laennerbund Hall was well filled and
gave Major Schmitz an ovation when
he entered the building. Charles Meinert
was the presiding officer.
The largest meeting of the^ evening was
held at the rooms of the Building Trades
Council, 927 Mission street. An overflow
meeting was held upstairs to satisfy the
crowd. Mayor Schmitz spoke at both,
"Let me beseech you." he said, "to
vote the ticket straight. Do not pick a
few men here and there and vote for
them. This is a ticket of which every
one of us may be proud and every ona
cf us should support .It from top to bot
tcm. This is not a fight politically on
the part of the wage earners, it Is a nght
to preserve the integrity of the labor
unions in this city. A vote for any one
of the Fusion candidates is a vote for
the Citizens' Alliance. Study over the
question and then judge the future by
the past."
The last speech was delivered at th 9 *.
smoker held by the Carmen in Eagles'
Hall. Richard Cornelius presided over
this gathering. -*- T

cated when they went to the usual
place to obtain their mail. While it ia
the general opinion of a majority of
the citizens that the new location is far
more convenient for the people, still
they are inclined to condemn the man
ner In which It was carried out. The
postmaster admitted to-day that he
was a party to the action and was la
favor of the move.
United States District Attorney Sum
merfield stated to-day that lt was his
opinion that the postar laws of the
Federal Government had been grossly
violated and that the Government will
probably act in the matter, although he
has not yÂ«t received any orders to that
effect. The opinion of the postmaster
is that he acted in accordance with his
rights and that the Government cannot
take any action ln tho matter, as no
Federal laws were violated.

VARIED DEALS
DE M'CURDY
President of New York Mu
tual Life Participates in
Fifteen Outside Syndicates
TRUST COMPANIES AIDED
Prosper Through Use of In
surance Funds Advanced
at Low Interest Rates
NEW YORK. Oct. 19.â Richard A.
McCurdy. president of the Mutual Life
Insurance Company, made the state
ment to-day that he had no Intention
of resigning, that he was elected' to
serve until June 7 next, and that
nothing could or would drive him out.
It was announced from ' th-Â» District
Attorney's office that no action would
be taken regarding the George J. Plun
kitt affair, which was turned over to
the District Attorney yesterday by the
legislative committee that is investi
gating the insurance companies.
Closing one of the most sensational
and stretruous weeks of the Insurance
investigation, the committee, just be
tore adjournment to-day, concluded
the examination of Richard A. Mc-
Curdy, with the exception of a few de
tails he is to supply next week. Mc-
Curdy has been on the stand the
greater part of the three days of this
weeks session, and some of his testi
mony has been the most startling of
any that has been adduced before the
committee. His testimony to-day, how
ever, -was very much of a technical na
ture, though it was of much value to
the committee in its work.
TRUST COMPANIES PROSPER.
When he resumed the stand this
morning it was to take up his testi
mony as to the Mutual Life's connec
tion with trust companies. The infor
mation given by McCurdy disclosed
that the trust companies with which
the Mutual Life was connected became
very prosperous soon after they "were
taken up by the Mutual. Two cases in
point were the Morristown Trust Com
pany at Morristown, N. J-, where the
McCurdy family live, and the United
States Mortgage and Trust Company.
The former Is now controlled by. the
Mutual Life. McCurdy testified/ that,
besides being a director of this trust
company, he was a large stockholder
and would take more stock if he could
get it.
The Mutual Life keeps a balance of
not lees than $i!U0,000 with this com
pany, on which it draws from 2 to 3
per "cent. The latter rate has been paid
only since September. McCurdy did not
know the holdings of the other mem-
Ijers of his family in this company.
In the syndicate operation, McCurdy
said, he participated not with the idea of
drawing- bonds, but to obtain his share
of the commission allowed by bankers.
CARRIES HEAVY INSURANCE.
McCurdy was asked what life Insurance
he carried, and he was unable to say at
once, but James M. Beck, his counsel,
presented a statement showing when the
policies were taken out, for what amount*
and the plan. These aggregated $200,000,
all in the MutuaL McCurdy testified that
he was also Insured in the Equitable, the
Wasnington and the Connecticut Mutual.
Before he left the stand McCurdy said
he paid $4500 for his apartment in the
Grosvenor building, which is owned by
the Mutual. x -
When McCurdy was excused his son,
Robert H. McCurdy, was called to ex
plain some charges for traveling ex
penses in 1904. He said one of his duties
as general manager was to visit the
agencies about the country. Three such
trips were made, the expenses of which
aggregated about $3600. McCurdy said
that while on one trip he was accom
panied by his father, mother, wife and
the latter's maid, but that the expense
accounts were for himself individually
and did not include those of any other
member of his family or party. He had
a private car on one of these trips. He
could not tell why the expenses. on these
trips were .so large, but said he would
give the details later.
McCurdy was followed by W. W. Rich
ards, comptroller of the Mutual, who ex
plained the manner in which the Mutual
acquired come properties by foreclosure.
McCURDVS SYNDICATE DEALS.
During the day President McCurdy
banded in the following lists of syndi
cates in which both he and the Mutual
Life Insurance Company wtre interested:

.Put Balance on Other Side
TOPEKA. Kanj., Oct. IB.â The report
of the receivers filed to-day In the
United States District Court here,
showed the assets of C. J. Devlin, who
failed last July, to be $4,956,948, and
the direct liabilities $4,692,208. This in
dicates that the assets amount to near
ly half a million dollars more than the
direct liabilities. There is listed, how
ever. $1,039,379 in contingent liabili
ties, for which the receivers do not
know whether they are liable "or not.
Should it bo necessary to pay these, the
liabilities will exceed the assets by
$874,639.
Tho'most interesting item in the re
port is that one which deals with C. .T.
Devlin personally. This shows that his
personal assets amount to $1,747,41f1,
and that his direct liabilities are $904,
442.: This Is listed separately in the re
port because of the interwoven rela
tions existing between Devlin and his
several companies. Among the contin
gent liabilities is an item of $744,000
owed by the Southwestern Fuel Com
pany, in which Devlin was largely in
terested and which is in involuntary
bankruptcy.

SAYS BOILERS
WERE DEFECTIVE
Lieutenant Commander Hal
stead Gives Testimony at
the Bennington Inquiry
Special XHapatoh to The Call.
VAiLBJO. Oct. 19.â 1f the opinions
of the two expert witnesses introduced
by the defense In the court-martial \u25a0of
Commander ' Luclen YounJ; are accept
ed the prosecution's six days' effort to
establish certain facts through the tes
timony of Lieutenant Commander Bart
lett .will have proved futile.
Commander Ransom, who was on the
stand yesterday, laid the foundation
for the defense's theory that the ex
plosion on the Banning ton was caused
by the defective construction of the
boiler and that, a few dollars spent in
better rivets would have prevented the
catastrophe.
. Lieutenant Commander Alexander
Halstead, navigating: officer of the Chi
cago, who -was a member of the board
of inquiry that convened at San Diego,
was called this morning as an expert
for the defense. He stated that he had
served as an officer of the old engineer
ing corps of the navy from 1885 un
til 1898, when .the corps was abolished.
He added interest to his testimony by
stating that he was the engineering
officer of the United States steamship
Bennington for a period of \u25a0 eighteen
months from 1893. While the witness
was ' attached to . the Bennington the
valves of -the various boilers were re
garded as unreliable. The rolling of
the ship 'caused' them to soon become
unsettled ,eveir' aXtar frequent adjust
ment. Halstead did not remember, the
condition of the i lifting gear of the
valves.
'In answer to a" question aÂ« to the
condition"- of the; rivets .' of the boiler
when they wereTexamined '\u25a0 by him at
San Diego. :Halstead; stated that they
were thin and corroded. "\u25a0; He "said they
either 'had been' faultily constructed or
had worn thin. Halstead again con
tradicted- Bartlett's -testimony by
stating : that he ' did not find any oil in
his *â¢' examination of boiler' "B" < and> he
did not a think that. the crowh'sheet
came down from : overheating by f: the
oil. : The entire f afternoon was taken

vhote fortune- she is fighting, that she did
not tc-11 tyen ber hu.Â»l)und of l:er rela
tionship to Lloyd until after she and Nix
vtie married. The woman says she
promised Lloyd that she would not di
vulg* h's secret; it is the purpose of her
ctt^rnejs 10 prove that she kept her
I'romise and that the dead capitalist,
time out of mind, told her and others
that she would receive by his will a
child's sharÂ«", or two-fifteenths, of the
estate, which is variously estimated at
from 8380.009 to J500.0i.t0.
Late this afternoon Samuel G. Nix,
hueband of the contestant, took the
stand In Judge Ellsworth's court and told
bow he had met Bessie Lioyd in the
Davis block, at Eleventh and Washing
ton streets: how he had wooed her and
finally won her and had taken her and
bet mother to live ai Sixteenth and Clay
eirtrts, where Lloyd also lived.
"At any time prior to your marriage,
did Jou know the woman who is now
your wife was Lloyd's daughter?" asked
Attorney M. C. Chapman for the con
testant. \u25a0.""
Attorney W. S. Goodfellow, for the
heirs, objected to the question and Judge
Ellsworth asked its purpose.
KEPT SECItJST WELL.
i "We propose to show," said Chapman.
j slowly, "that this woman kept faith with
her father so far that she even deceived
the man she married until after the
wedding."
The question" was allowed and Nix re
plied that he had been kept in ignorance.
After he learned of the relationship, he
testified he went to Lloyd's home in
Berkeley and was assured by the cap
italist that Mrs. Nix would receive a
child's share, or two-fifteenths, of the es-'
tate.
"> It is the contention of Lloyd's widow
*nd four children that Mre. Nix is enti
tled only to the T5OOO bequeathed to her. in
. the capualists will. On the other hand,
she asserts that she is the natural daugh
ter of the decedent and that he brought
her and her mother from England, prom
ising to provide for them during their
lives. When he did not do that, she al
leges, she taxed him with his neglect,
and he promised to bequeath a. child's
chare in the estate to her, provided she
would aid him in promoting his third
marriage. She cays she did this and
through her influence Mary Crossly be
came his wife. In order to do this the
greatest secrecy in regard to his first,
or common-law,, marriage, was main
tained.
When the case was called this morn
ing Mrs. Nix was subjected to a rapid
tire of crow-questions, but she kept well
her selt-control and many of her answers
were of dramatic interest. After asking
several questions as to Lloyd's reasons
for keeping matters secret from Mary
Crossly, Goodfellow asked:
"Why was such eecrecy observed here?"
ENGAGED TO ANOTHER.
"He was also engaged to Mies Loie
Helen Wilkinson and all sorts of things
were going on in the house," replied the
witness, theatrically. "There is no reason
to bring them out here."
Then the witness, under cross-examina
tion, repeated her story of yesterday;
how she had broken off her engagement
to a Mr. Moffitt in England to bring her
mother to California; how Bhe had been
pressed for money and how she finally
married Sam Nix; how Lloyd had prom
ised to give her a child's ishare in the
estate and had failed. Letters were in
troduced to show that she had always
addressed her father as "Charles," but
*he explained this by saying it was a
.part of the plan for secrecy arranged by
Lloyd. A letter written by her to Lloyd
.in June, 1890, stated that it was his own
proposition to give her mother $23 a
month and to supply her with money
elso and It ended by demanding that the
capitalist give them 1500 pounds. Upon
the receipt of this amount the letter
isaid, Lloyd would not be troubled by
them again.
: "I need not remind you of the past
years," the letter continued. "Doubt
less, they are as well impressed on your
mind as on ours, the trouble of which can
never be erased. It is certainly the best
thing now to have an -understanding; also
release you from any responsibility which
our presence holds."
John A. Britton, of the Oakland Gas,
Light and Heat Company, was called, but
his testimony was not important. While
Interested in the lighting business with
Lloyd, he said he heard Lloyd speak of
& wife at Sixteenth and Clay streets.
The hearing will be resumed Monday.

thought, is demented or an accomplice
of burglars. What the motive of the
strange female can be is a puzzle.'
The woman's fashionable attire and
finished address would indicate that
she is not a mendicant. In one inr

PATENT BUTTER
DECLARED POOR
Professor Jaffa Says That Inventors Are
: l \' -Making Miserable Substitutes.
Little Fat and Much Water Make a Vile
Counterfeit of the Genuine.
BERKELEY, Oct. 19.â Subtle :at
tempts to get the sanction qf the uni
versity authorities for schemes which
have as their end the foisting of
"queer" butter upon the public are be
ing given their quietus by Professor
E. M. Jaffa, the food expert attached
ito the staff of the agricultural college.'
There is an apparent epidemic of these
efforts to produce butter by chemical
means and then to procure, in some
fashion, the quasi approval of the uni
versity, with which to later deceive
ithe butter-buying public.
Professor Jaffa. r. as determined to
crush the. hopes of .these wily butter
makers and has prepared- a letter to
the promoters which informs them in
no uncertain terms that he. is fully
cognizant of their schemes and that
their hopes of- getting any authoriza
tion from ithe university food . experts
are in vain.
The latest inventor of a patented
butter which could be made cheaply
and sold at market prices is an Ala
meda citizen, whose name Professoi
Jaffa withholds, but who evidently be
lieved that the product of his labora
tory would meet \vi,th Jaffa's full ap
proval. This manufacturer of yellow
imitation butter sent Professor Jaffa
a quantity of his made goods, but
neglected to state Just what his for
mula was for its making. Professor
Jaffa has analyzed the stuff and re
ports that its make-up is as follows:
Water, 52.57 per cent; fat, 44.56 per
cent; protein, 2.45; ash, .42. Professor
Jaffa declares, and so informed the
Alameda man, that in good butter the
percentage of fat Is 85, so that in two
pounds of butter there would be about
.twenty-seven ounces of fat. In the
sample submitted to Jaffa' from Ala
meda there was less than eight ounces
of fat to the pound.
Dr. H. W. Wiley. Government ex
pert in these matters stationed at
Washington, has prepared a bulletin
dealing with these attempts at manu
facturing butter with the aid of water,
powders and other chemicals, and to
this exhaustive bulletin Professor Jaffa
refers all of the would-be inventors
of the yellow stuff that is in demand
by the people. It is Professor -Jaffa's
opinion that none of the wise Invent
ors has anything new besides the
schemes Professor Wiley treats of to
introduce in the line of chemically
manufactured butter.

WILL ABANDON
PART OF ROAD
Western Pacific to Avoid
tesla Line and Cross the
Hills at Pattersons Pass
OAKLAND, Oct. 19. â That the West
ern Pacific Railroad has abandoned Its
original plan to follow the route of the
western end of the Tesla coal road and
that it will build a subway beneath
the tracks of the Southern Pacific at
Third and Union streets, Oakland, are
two Important facts that have definite
ly been decided upon by the manage
ment.
Since the Western Pacific first ac
quired the coal road it has been â¢_' ac
cepted ithat it would be the route of
the new road from Stockton to Liver
more. Now it has been decided to
abandon a part of the coal road in
Corral Hollow .Pass and to follow a
route from Niles to Llvermore parallel
with the Southern Pacific. From Llv
ermore it will cross Pattersons Pass
and will then join the coal road at a
point beyond Altamont. \u0084
The plan for the subway under the
Southern Pacific tracks on Third street
at Union has also been decided upon
and once beyond Third street the
Western Pacific will reach its own
property. Within the last two weeks
deeds to almost all the property with
the exception of Boole's from the hold
ings of the Southern Pacific to Mar
ket street have been placed on record.
The new road now owns more yard
room and more water front property
ithan - its . rival. . In many instances its
holdings go" back as far as; Seventh
street. Already boatloads of ties are
being , discharged at Boole's to be
stored on the x-ailroad's property pend
ing the beginning of the work.
Division Engineer J. T. Williams is
now absent on his final -inspection to
determine the route from the Oakland
city.limits to. Niles. He will decide
upon one of three routes. They all are
run from the south side of Niles and
cross the Southern Pacific tracks at
Decoto. From there one-parallels the
Southern Pacific, another Is run half
way between the Southern Pacific and
the county road and the . ithircL- crosses
that ' thoroughfare and is run "between
the county road and the foothills.

Made by the Company
Ssecial Vlap*ic'n to The Call.
PALO ALTO. Oct. 19. â Measures will
be taken by the Board of Town Trus
tees of this place to prevent the Red
wood City Electric Light and Power
Company from operating here without
a franchise.
Since electric light and power was
first supplied to Palo Alto tha Redwood
City concern had* no opposition until
the municipal plant was Installed. The
question then arose whether a fran
chise was necessary for the private
corporation. Threats of rate-cutting
have had no effect on the Trustees.
Trustee George Carey. William Dean.
B. P. Lausten and David Curry held a
conference yesterday with the officials
of the Redwood City concern- The
proposition of purchasing the works
and plant by the Trustees for Palo
Alto was rejected. Of the several plans
suggested none was accepted as favor
able to the municipality. The officials
of the Redwood concern refused to turn
over the local branch of their plant,
asserting that a franchise is no more
necessary now than it was when they
first entered this territory.
Attorneys are being consulted by the
Town Trustees as to the steps neces
sary to sursue in order to oust the
Redwood company. In the meantime
the Trustees are ready to purchase
enough apparatus to supply all the
Redwood City company's patrons
should the latter be forced out.
The plan of the Trustees is to meet
any rate reduction the corporation
makes. The town's finances are in
such a shane as to warrant this move.
Municipal ownership has been extreme
ly successful here, the current expenses
of this place having been paid with last
year's profits.

GREAT BAUER'S
GENIUS SHINES
IN CONCERT
A tribute to any audience was the
programme played by Harold Bauer
last evening at Lyric Hall. An ap
preciation that was a tribute .to any
player met It, though the house was
unexplicably small. Where are the pi
anists? Where are their pupils? To
hear a programme like last night's is
as good as ten lessons. Is it not, Mr.
Oscar Weil â you were there? Is it not,
Mr. Robert Tolmie, Mr. Wallace Sabin,
you were there? If this kind of sup
port meets the greatest pianist of the
day we shall not long be having here
the -great pianjets.'
Possibly last night's programme was
more a musician's than a lay pro
gramme, which would account for a
certain absent contingent. The same
cannot, however, be said for Saturday,
when will be given the third and last
recital of Mr. Bauer, with a nearly
popular programme.
Handel's Suite in G opened last even
ing's recital, given .beautifully in the
ancient style, its floriture delicately
pompous, its whole feeling antiquely
polished, and with such clarity of
technique! Mr. Bauer drops on one
of those harpsichord staccatl like
a butterfly in a bowl of cream â
and you don't, moreover, touch bottom
when he strides like Krishna from
star to star in the thunders of a
Schumann theme or in Liszt at his
most. The Faschingschwank was last
nighfs Schumann, epically handled. I
have three words to give to Caesar
Franck's prelude, chorale and fugue, a
work of tremendous reach but lesser
grasp that was last night introduced
here. Very free In form it is, char
actered uncertainly, distinctly Slavic
at times, at others Grleg-llke, and
again Wagnerlan. Its construction Is
highly Ingenious.- particularly In the
fugue, though it is throughout won
derfully clever. . Possibly the chorale
gives up most on first hearing. Aren
sky in "Au Bord de la Mer," Llzst with
"St. Francis Walking On the Waves"
â Where was Alkan's "The Wind?"â
were other numbers, with.Balaklnep In.
a brilliant scherzo and Poldinl In
a study .that was probably not writ
ten before Chopin's "Butterfly," com
pleting tho list. Like that, !t was
greedly redemanded. A beautiful pro
gramme, adorably played.

BANK FOUND
TO BE IN A
SAD PLIGHT
Enterprise National 1 Run in
a Hel ter-Skeltef \ Manner
Without the Knowledge
of Its Board of Directors
MANY POLITICIANS
DEEPLY INVOLVED
Accused of Having Made Use
of the Institution, and
Further Sensational Facts
Are Promised From Case
PITTSBURG. Oct. 19.â Investigation in
to the condition of the " Enterprise Na
tional Bank, which was closed by the
Controller of the Currency yesterday,
shows- beyond a doubt that the institu
tion was conducted in a manner entirely
unknown to the directors.
From a representative of the bank, it
is learned that since the investigation
started papers and notes have been
brought to the attention of the directors
which they never saw before^ Among
these papers are two notes bearing the
name of W. U. Andrews, who to-day
stated positively that he had no paper in
the bank. Bank Examiner Cunningham,
who is in charge of the institution, would
say nothing concerning this statement,
but the source of the Information Is
thoroughly reliable. - ' .
The statement made to-day by the of
ficials of the Santa Fe Central Railway
and the Pennsylvanian Development
Company on behalf of which Cashier
Clarke, who committed suicide yester
day, is said to have negotiated loans,
would seem to place all the blame on
Clarke, who so far as known, left no
explanation of the bank's relations with
the two companies.
Supplementary statements by signers of
the statement and their attorneys show
that they take the position that Clarke
was the fiscal agent of their companies
and that as such it was his duty to look
after funds and raise money when neces
sary.
STATE MOXEY INVOLVED.
The directors speak hopefully of re
storing thti bunk to solvency and re
suming business in a month or six
weeks, pointing to promises made by
those charged with getting money on
notes to make good the amount. They
also express the hope that Clarke's es
tate will amount to $500,000 or $600,
000, but in this they seem to be hoping
against hope. Whatever there is of it
will be used in straightening out the
bank's affairs.
The amount of the State money sup
posed to be in the bank will probably
reach $782,000, but the exact amount
will not be known for some days yet.
The State to-day entered a- Judgment
against the bank directors on their in
dividual bonds to* secure Its deposits.
These -^securities can be collected at
once.
A story current to-day was to. the ef
fect that had Clarke not killed himself
on Wednesday night both' the Santa Fe
Central and the Pennsylvania Develop
opment Company might now be held
by other interests. ;He is alleged to
have held what amounted to a purchase
of both the railroad and the develop
ment company and was in communica
tion with Interests in New York, with
whom he had practically closed a deal
for their sale.
To-morrow the directors of the bank
will hold a meeting to consider the
matter of applying for a receiver for
the Santa Fe Central Railroad. The
object! of this move is to secure reim
bursement for any loans that may have
been made to the promoters by Cashier
Clarke. \u25a0
CASHIER MAY BE DEFAULTER.
The developments following' the
tragedy and the closing of the bank
have been startling, Involving, as they
do, the "names of several prominent
citizens who have been active in State
politics.
According to President Gwlnner. the
bank, through Cashier Clarke, has fur
nished most of the funds used to float
the Santa Fe Central Railroad and the
Pennsylvania Development Company,
In which former State Senators W. H.
Andrews and Arthur Kennedy, and
Francis J. Torrance were deeply in
terested, together with Cashier Clarke.'
The two projects are allied ones. For
mer Senator Arthur Kennedy Is presi
dent of the development company and
former Senator W. H. Andrews la
president of the other. Francis ,'X.
Torrance Is heavily Interested In both
concerns and his confidential man,;W.
C. Hagan, is secretary of both com
panies. . .
An inquiry is being made into Cashier
Clarke's personal affairs. He was esti
mated to have been worth 5300,000, but his
friends say that he sanÃ all his assets
Every woman may be attract-

Again and again they ' have

THE REAL ISSUE.,
TO every thoughtful citizen of San Francisco the issue in this
campaign is respect for law and order and the performance, of
public duty without graft. Mr. Partridge by his stirring dec
larations has made himself the representative of that issue. So
far the onJy attempt -made to discredit him is by the organs of the
administration, which try to impeach the sincerity of the relorm
movement. Those organs unwittingly admit the need of reform
when they insist that it cannot be expected under an administration
headed by Mr. Partridge. This kind of campaigning is evidence
of the strait in which the grafters find themselves. Heretofore
they liavc. won by division of the opposition and the nomination of
separate tickets. This resource was taken away when the two par
ties combined. The platform of that combination was tersely
elated by Mr. Partridge in his ratification speech, when he said:
* : Ur?it has no principles, and honesty should have no politics.".
The graft organs find it necessary to divide the opposition, and
they seek to do this by harping upon the insincerity of the anti-
graft movement. Under the charter the Mayor is the real ruler of
the city. He appoints all of the executive boards and commissions,
and he* controls their policy. When the police looked on, indifferent
and unheeding, while citizens were assaulted on the sidewalk and
in the street cars by lawbreakers incited by the Mayor and Mr.
Ruef. it meant that the Mayor had decided to suppress newspaper
criticism by unlawful violence, and that through his control of the
Police Commission the members of the force well understood that
they must stand in and let the riot proceed.
Citizens learned in that incident that when the Mayor chose to
remove from them the protection of the law he did not scruple to
<kÂ« it. for the advancement of his own ends. His conduct' was rep-^
rchensible and revolutionary. It was the use of official power in a
private fend, and for personal purposes. By the time the Republican
League movement crystallized in a Republican convention, regu
larly and lawfully chosen, the Mayor was emboldened to go fur-Â»
ther. and the police understood well what they were expected to do.
They were counted on to aid in breaking up the Republican con
vention, and to do this they committed a crime by breaking down
the gallery doors of the Alhambra Theater to admit a" mob for the
purpose of browbeating the convention. The Mayor had denied
to citizens the peaceable use of the streets by turning loose a y mob
to assault the buyers of a newspaper that he disliked.
SFroni this it was an easy step to deny to the people the right
peaceful assembly, which is guaranteed to them by the constitu
tion of the United States. It is his duty and that of his police to
protect the people in public assembly. It is part of his official
oath. But he. by his agents, the police, triÂ§d to prevent such assem
bly, and in the effort crime was committed in his interest. It is
possible that graft may exist in an administration, and at the same
time such primary rights as the use of the streets and peaceful as
sembly may be secure. It is possible that graft may exist without
violation of the ballot box and debauchery of the franchise. But
here we have a trinity of shame. Graft exists, the peaceful- use of
the streets and the right of assembly are denied, and the ballot
box has been stuffed.
Use and familiarity beget indifference. These flagrant viola
tions of right and law are openly justified by Mr. Ruef and are
condoned by the Mayor. These offenses are committed with frank
openness and in view of everybody. Can it be possible that any con
siderable number of our citizens feel that they are the necessary
incidents of municipal administration, and that there is no use
trying to prevent them and secure something better? Can it be
possible that use and familiarity have bred such indifference that
the people will make no effort for a change? It is perfectly plain
that the Mayor and Mr. Ruef think that indifference has reached
that stage, and that all they have to do is to charge that Mr. Part
ridge is not in good faith and that if elected he will let things go
on as they are, only turning' to his own benefit the acts that now
unlawfully promote the political â¢ fortunes of the 'Mayor and the
lush graft of Ruef.,
Against this subtle form of attack we desire to warn the people.
It is an attempt to make it appear that Partridge is no better ihari
the Mayor, and it is hopeless to strive for a change. We know the
sincerity of Mr. Partridge. His ever)- utterance, the incidents of
his career, the moral make and fiber of the man, all stand ia evi
dence of his sincerity. He is on the firing line of reform as truly
as Folk was in St. Louis, Jerome in New York* and Weaver, in
Philadelphia. Every pledge of good government that he makes
will be redeemed. The laws will be enforced, civil service upheld,
the police made to do their duty under his administration. '
If the people want these improvements in the city administra
tion they will support him. We believe they want such an admin
istration as he promises and that they will support him. If any who
want something better in city government than we are getting, say
that the time has not come, and that the instruments of change
in sight are not adapted to their purpose, and that things must go
on getting worse before they can be made better, such are making
a mistake. The immense power of an administration in this city,
if used for wrong purposes and to promote graft, presents a danger
of the most appalling magnitude. We see arrayed now on the
fide of Ruef and the Mayor every form of official power and every
phase of vice and disorder.
When these, in a line-up fight, are permitted to prevail, their
number and power will increase until far other means than those
now in action will be necessary to break their grip on the govern
ment of the city. Now is the time to strike, to use the excellent in
strumentalities that are at hand, and if the co-operation of citizens
be as cordial as the necessity for it is great, we will get now the
reform which later on will be nearly impossible.
THE CHINESE STUDENTS.
THE Western world is getting a glimpse of what Japanese ex
ample is doing for China. Japan-was regenerated by applying
the knowledge gained by her students in the schools and uni
versities of the United States and Europe. That knowledge over
threw the feudal traditions, transformed the people, created repre
sentative institutions, promoted general education and made Japan
a power in the world, the first Asiatic power that has existed for
centuries, and the only one that has earned admission into the fam
ily of Nations. It was the work of students.
Heretofore China has educated many men in this country and
Europe, but on returning home they have been absorbed into ths
ancient system, without effecting any change in its structure. Now
a different use of Western education is appearing. The Chinese
students are organizing in that empire to apply their knowledge
to a change in its genius and methods. They propose to retain the
impressisris of the new life they learned in the West; and to create
a new China to face the new Japan. Their action supplies a strong
reason for extending to the Chinese the opportunity and hospitality
of our American schools and universities.
We need not go to China for all of , the material. We have, it
here in. the Chinese who are domesticated among us. There are
hundreds of native born Chinese who should be encouraged, to get
education here, that they may carry it back to the land of their
fathers for the uplifting of the blood of which they are a part. They
have the extraordinary advantage of knowledge of English. We
should not neglect our opportunity to have our part in the lifting of
China from the inertness of centuries into the light of modern op
portunity. , -

KEEPING INFORMED
WOMEN THRIVE ON ILLUSIONS.
Wise Husbands Should Encourage Their Dreams.
ANGELA MORGAN
ONE of the most difficult ideas for
a woman to adjust her mind to
is the thought that the man to
whom she- is betrothed or married. may
not regard their attachment as the love
of affinities.
A woman's love is based on this the
ory of affinity. It would be hard for
her to love perfectly if this were not so.
If there is any one suggestion that
the 'woman of sentiment and imagina
tion simply refused to accept it is the
Intimation that the man of her choice
is not the choice of destiny; * that he
was not selected for her and she for
him by, some power outside of them
selves â a power mysterious, mighty
and not to be gainsaid.
In her heart she believes all- the
gods, fates, influences, forces in j. this
world and other worlds, perhaps, have
united in bringing about their meeting;
that their souls have been approach
in s each other, calling each other, per
haps, for centuries.
Any suggestion given by the man
she loves to show he does not share
her belief is a rude shock to her , feel
ings and her love suffers from the ef
fect a3 a tender plant suffers from

rude treatment or neglect.
Woman's affection draws a largo
share of its sustenance from this be
lief in the permanence and the fatality
of love. : A :.\voman's ideal ( 6f -love ? . -is
rooted in this faith; the man she mar
ries is her affinity, and they belong to
each other for time and eternity. .This
idea forms the very atmosphere in
which her love lives and breathes. De
stroy this belief and her love gasps for
lack of spiritual oxygen. ,
Yet how few men are wise enough to
refrain from destroying this '.'illusion,"
as the practical masculine mind would
term it.
I. believe much unh|ipplness in mar
ried life could be traced to 'the tact
lessness of husbands'in assailing this
beautiful ideal of love cherished by
their wives.
The other day I heard a young busi
ness man make this frank admission:
"I have never believed in affinities; the
idea is absurd to me. Every. man that
marries,-- no matter how happily," could
doubtless have found contentment
quite as great had he married any one
of a hundred other women."
I fear it is true that this young man

voiced the conviction of the averagre male
on the marriage question.
Men are essentially practical In all their
views. They have been compelled by
circumstances to develop the practical
side: of their lives to the exclusion of
those finer enjoyments known by. women
who, as a sex, have had : greater oppor
tunity to explore the higher regime of
mind and soul.
It is difficult for the average man to see
the "sense"; In women's lofty views. To
comprehend what Is meant by the "splrit
ual" r in love. That is why, few masculine
mindsfsee the "reason" in;the theory of
sour affinity.
But that gives no man the right to as
sail his wife's beliefs; nor does It give
him' cause to shatter her
There would be far more ' happiness in
marriage if men would seek to see the
reason in the feminine view Instead of
ridiculing it,' because they do not com
prehend lt.v.
A woman's love Is made up of "Il
lusions." Why should any, husband dispel
them? They give to marriage & deeper
significance; they help to keep the wife
courageous and loyal. They are'the very
basis of her happiness.
Husbands, If you cannot accept the
lofty ideals of : your wives, : at least keep
your views to yourselves and permit the
women to be, happy.
Never let I your wives think you believe
you could have found happiness with any
other 1 helpmate.
. Unless you have the courage to oonf ess
your views before marriage, don't make
the disastrous mistake of giving utterance
to them afterward.'-" : :' ; \u25a0

COFFEE NEURALGIA
l.farn Whrn You Qul< and Us* Poatnm.
A lady who unconsciously drifted
Into nervous prostration brought on by
coffee, cayÂ«: â¢
"I have b^n a drinker all my
Ufe and used It regularly three times a
day.
"A year or two agro I became sub-
ject to nervous neuralgia, attacks of
nervous headache and general nervous
prostration which not only Incapaci-
tated me for doing my housework, but
frequently made it necessary for me to
remain In a dark room for two or three
days at a time.
"I employed several good doctors,
one after the other, but none of them
was able to give me permanent relief.
"Eight months ago a friend suggest-
ed that perhaps coffee was the cause
of my troubles and that I try Postum
Food Coffee and give up the old kind.
I am glad I took her advice, for my
health has been entirely restored. I
have no more neuralgia, nor have I
had one solitary headache In all these
eight months.- No more of my days
are wasted In solitary confinement in
a dark room. I do all my own work
with ease. The flesh that I lost dur- j
Ing the years of my nervous prostra-
tion has come back to me during- these
months, and I am once more a happy,
healthy woman. I inclose a list of
n*.mes of friends who can vouch for
t|B truth of the statement" Name

Assistant District Attorney
Hanley Secures a Warrant
for C. H. MorrelTs Arrest
EMBEZZLEMENT CHARGE
Accused of Drawing a Salary
Demand of Leo .\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0lff. Cas
tillo Without Authority
Assistant District Attorney James
Hanley, who has been active in pro
tecting 1 members of the Fire Depart
ment from the exorbitant rates of in
terest charged by money sharks, g-ot
Leo M. Castillo, a member of Truck 6, to
swear to a complaint 'before Police
Judge Cabaniss yesterday afternoon
charging C. H. Morrell, room 609, Ex
aminer building, with misdemeanor em
bezzlement.
Castillo borrowed $62 50 from Mor
rell on October 2, 1901, on a note -in
wWch he agreed to pay Morrell 10 per
cent interest per month. The follow
ing conditions are printed in the note:
If any of said payments are not paid when
due and payable, the whole of the principal
sum then remaining; unpaid shall forthwith
become dvÂ« and payable at the option of the
holder of this note. And to secure the pay
ment of above note, I hereby authorize Ir
revocably any attorney of any court of record
to appear for me In such court, any term, time
of vacation, or before any Justice of the* Peace
at any time hereafter, and confess Judgment
without process in favor of the holder of this
note for such amount as may appear to be
unpaid thereon together with costs and $10 at
torney's fees, and to waive and release all.er
rors which may intervene In any such-pro
ceedings and consent to immediate execution
upon such Judgment, hereby ratifying and con
firming all that my said attorney may do by
virtue thereof.
Castillo made one payment of $20
on the following November 30, leaving
542 50 unpaid. On this amount Cas
tillo has been paying Morrell $4 25 per
month since, making a total for inter
est of $237 75. The last monthly in
terest was collected on September 18.
It is alleged that Morrell, without hav
ing any power of attorney, drew Cas
tillo's salary warrant on September 30
for $98 for that month, retained $50 to
cover the amount remaining due ' by
Castillo, and handed the balance of
$48 to I. Franklin & Co., money brok
ers, to whom Castillo is indebted. That
left Castillo and his wife and five chil
dren without a cent in the house to
buy provisions and to pay rent.
Hanley made a demand upon Mor
rell for the $48, but the only answer
he got was that the money had been
handed over to Franklin & Co. Cas
tillo declares that he never grave Mor
rell a power of attorney and that the
drawing: of his salary warrant was en
tirely urvauthorized.

Petition Filed by Pupils
and Parents.
A delegation of pupils from the Com
mercial High School appeared before the
Board of Education yesterday to urge
that the school be dismissed at 3 o'clock
instead of at 3:35 p. m. Roncbvieri said
the extra half hour was intended for
practice on ths typewriters, and George
Fletcher, father of one of the pupils, said
this was done at; the expense of the
health of the pupils. .
Director Altman thought that as the
petition for the early closing had been
signed by the parents of all the pupils
in the school who wanted it closed at the
same time as other high schools it was
entitled to consideration. Langdon spoke
on similar lines and a motion to close
the commercial school at 3 o'clock pre
vailed, with Roncovieri voting no and
Altman and Boyle in favor. The petition
was prepared by the student body, and
the committee appointed to interview the
board consisted of Ella Fletcher, Ethel
Lundherg, Gladys Couth, Ellsworth Fitz
gerald, Perclval E. Williams, Harry New
man and Miss Nerisca Nolan.
Teachers' certificates were granted to
Arthur Marcurda, Ethel A. Young, Mar

John Bourdette Leaves Ani

Makes Friends With Hunter
on Car and Is Later
Returned to His Owner
John Bourdette, the well known gun
man, need not fear that his Irish water
spaniel, Jack, may get lost, for the ani
mal can take care of himself any time.
Jack and his master were out for the
opening shoot on the preserves of the
Prlngle Gun Club on the Sulsun marshes
on Sunday. At the conclusion of - the
day* sport, Bourdette concluded to leave
the &og at the club house In care of the
keeper. Possibly if Jack could talk he
may have told his master that It was all
r:pht to hunt on the Sulsun marshes but
'-.virg there was not as comfortable as at
his San Mateo home.
The dog was kept in confinement for a
couple of days but yesterday when he
was given his freedom he. made .for home.
Gcing to the station, which is four miles
from the club house. Jack boarded a
train for home. He mixed up with the
passengers until he came across a few
hunter* whom he found to his liking. Cal
McMahon of Bartlett Springs, who was
among the group, took possession of the
canine. He knew that the animal be
longed to some hunter, so, when he ar
rived In town he telephoned to the
Pringle Club and found out Bourdetto

Nelson's Manager Believes
McGovern Is Capable of
Putting Up a Good Fight
Special D: t patch to The Call.
KAX6AS CITY, Oct. 19.â "1f McGovern
has really come to himself again, he will
probably be the next opponent for Bat
tling Nelson." said Billy Nolan, while
discussing "Terrible Terry's" match with
Tommy Murphy in Philadelphia.
"I have always considered him a great
fighter and I am much pleased at the re
sult of the fight in which he seems to
have displayed all of his old time bril
liancy. "McGovern was always a dan
gerous man and I was not surprised that
the match ended as it did. When the
Brooklyn fighter went to ths bad, and
was placed in a sanitarium In New York,
my great regret was that he had not
lasted long enough to give Nelson a show
at him.
"The styles of both boys are somewhat
the same, as each likes to mix matters
and a go for that reason between them
would probably be a great success. Both
weigh the same and therefore are nat
ural rivals.
"Now that he seems to have recovered
his old form nothing would please me
better than a match between the two.
You can say for me that whenever a
suitable purse is offered that I am ready
to sign articles of agreement for a Nel
son-McGovern go at any time."

SIWASHES COME BACK
After Annexing Three on
Combination of Bad Work
They Quickly Slow Down
j The Commuters were there with the big
i stand at the Eighth street lot yesterday
j afternoon, and by taking a few rides
jon the ones that Oscar Jones tried to
I transform .'- Into i mystlflers V they saved
j themselves from taking a jump into-sec
' ond place. -'; Oakland started early and
I finished late. " The opening and closing
rounds were good ones for them and
'netted runs enough to hold the Siwashes
I for a while.
. It' sure was bad baseball all .the way
through, though spme lively hitting and
the arrival of bunches of runs at one time
served to stir up a bit of excitement that
made the fans forget about the article
of ball that was being passed out. The
Siwashes pulled off one notable rally in
the second that came nearly breaking up
the game, but they quit Just one run
shy of tying the score, and after uiat
there was no one in the going save
Oakland.
Jones was accorded a fitting welcome
when he trotted out on the rubber in the
initial spasm. Van Haltren and Kruger
quickly beat out hits and Dunleavy
iiattened one against the right field fence
that sent both men along. Then Moski
man took a ride on'one out to left .and
Bull Croll let it get away from him.
Moskiman pulled up at third and Hogan
very nicely worked a squeeze play that
netted another run.
The Siwashes grabbed two hits in the
first, and in the second they came back
strong. Ham Iberg got bad after the
bases were filled on a couple of hits and
errors. He forced a run by passing Ben
nett and another when he hit Kane.
Walters' out sent one more through, mak
ing the score 4 to 3.
But the Communters did not care for
three. They began to get to Mr. Jones
once more in the next round and quickly
clouted another man over. Hostilities
were delayed from that time till the
seventh and eighth, when Oakland again
began to office up to Mr. Jones and
topped off a day's good work by annexing
three more aces.
Seattle resurrected Bull Croll and sta
tioned him out in left field in place of
Busher Walters. Kelly was out of the
running and . Dunleavy played second in
good shape for Oakland. Hogan chased
flies in right field and besides hitting the
ball some he got away with a great patch
in the last inning that was the sensation
of the afternoon. The score:

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19.â Baum's pitching,
errori by Casey and Flood's home run were
the features that figured in Tacoma's defeat at
the hands of the home team to-day. After
the first Inning, when he allowed two hits and
a base on balls that netted the visitors 'three
runs, Baum was Invincible and blanked the
Tacomas during the remaining Innings, allow
ing but three hits In all. -He was also ef
fective at the bat and his two timely singles
and a neat sacrifice enabled his team to win.
Flood put the ball over the right field fence
for a home run in the seventh when there, was
no onÂ« on base. In addition, the> Los Angelea
second baseman rapped out two singles. The
locals secured eleven hits, off Fitzgerald and
the score would have been much larger had
they been able to hit the ball when men were
on bases, a The locals had ten men left.

ON SPAULDING
Philadelphia Jack Jars the
Michigan Giant With Two
Hard Wallops in the Face
WOULD TAKE ON HAHT
Billy Delaney Is Carefully
Training AI Kaufmann at
CrolFs Gardens, Alaineda
j Jack O'Brien added a new sparring
1 partner to his corps of training assist
j ants yesterday In the person of Sam
! Spaulding. Biddy Bishop's giant young
! ster. Spaulding la just the sort of &
: man that Jack has been looking tor,*
I as he is a big. tough young fellow and
willing to rough it with the Quaker
boxer. : They sparred a few rounds yes
terday and put up a rather lively bout.
O'Brien closed Spauldlng'3 eye with a
[ left and started the claret with a right.
The Phlladelphian's exhibition of in
door work is exceptionally neat and
clean cut. Every line of exercise he
indulges in is done with a precision
and skill only gained from long ex
perience. His shadow boxing was a
feature of the afternoon's work. A
peculiar thing about Jack's fighting is
that, although a great defensive fight
er, he seldom backs away from an op
ponent. He keeps boring in, all tha
time, but is always 'on the alert and
ever ready to block. In speaking oÂ£
the approaching mill O'Brien said,
"Kaufmann's record of one-round vic
tories is due for a serious setback. I
hate to have to do it to a promising
youngster, but look at the money in
sight. Marvin Kart next, and may be
Jeffries. I'll win before the limit."
Over at Croll's Kaufmana takes a
decidedly different view of the matter
and he predicts tha,t O'Brien will taste
his sleep-producing wallop before the
fight is well under way. Delaney i 3
already satisfied with Al's condition,
but will not let up the hard work for
a few days. Xeedless to say, with De
laney handling the training end of fit,
Kaufmann will be at his best when t"he
gong sounds at Woodward's Pavilion
next Friday night.
FRANCE WILL XOT ACCEPT

Huron de Tarekhelm Says Bis Auto

NEW YORK. Oct. 19. â A letter la now on
its way to the Vanderbilt cup commission from,
the Automobile Club of France, and as so^n
as It U received thÂ« racing board of the Amer
ican Automobile Association will hold 1U first
meeting since the running of the Vanderbilt
cup race. Baron Adrlen de Turckhelm, thÂ»
official representative of the Automobile Club
of France at th* recent race, declared yester
day that the cup would not bÂ« accepted by
the French club.
"The French club has already declined to
promote- another Gordon Bennett cup race." he
said, "and It ."Cquld not very well accept the
Vanderbilt cup under the conditions of holding
a race for that trophy In France next seascn."
. Baron de Turckbeim, who win eatl f or bone
to-day on La Savoie, intimated that the French,
' club would offer suggestions regarding future
' competitions for the Vanderbilt cup.
"I would like to see It turned Into a trophy
for a big touring *vent." he added. "We have
so many high-class cars of acknowledged re
liability that the mere fact of winning a bis
speed event counts comparatively for Uttle."

The Pacific Mail Company's liner City

i uneventful.
Among the passengers was Charles
ttapelfeldt. a sailor, who left the
schooner San Buenaventura at Corinto
because the vessel, he says, was un
seaworthy. She is loaded with hard
wood logs and was leaking at the rate
of two inches an hour. The San Buena
ventura left Tillamook on July 10 for
Corinto. She reached her destination
Wifely and sailed from Corinto for this
port on October 12. It is nothing new
for the San Buenaventura to be leak
ing, and, Staprlfeldfs fears to the con
trary notwithstanding, there is every
reason to believe that the schooner will
liring her heavy cargo safely in through
the Golden Gate.
The Sydney was taken over to quar

EIiLIXGHOUSE IS ACCUSED
OF LVFLUEXCIXG MOTHER
His Sister and Hit Brother Sue to.Re
cover Shnre of Their Parent's
. Estate.
The hearing of the contest Instituted to the
will of the late Bertha Ellinghouse by her chil
dren, Edward C. and Em::ia Elltnghouse. be
gan before Judge CofCey yeeterday. The con
testants, who are represented by Attorneys
Samuel M^ Shortridge.ane iÂ»uls P. Boardman,
allege that the deceased was under the influ
ence of her son. Oscar,' who took advantage of
her . weak mental _condltlon to cause, her to
leave him all of her ?10,0C0 estate, which she
Inherited at the death of xer. son, Alfred Ell-
Inghouse. the theatrical manager.'
Attorney Shortridge made the opening state
ment to Judge Coffey, who Is sitting. without a
jury. -.He raid that he woijld prove that MrÂ«.
Elllnchouso died of senility, a statement borne
out by the death certificate, and that a long
time prior thereto she was In such an advanced
Â«tatd of dementia that she knew little of what
was going on about her.
While In this condition, he asserted, Oscar
Ellinghouse caused her to give him all of her
estate, and, to make assurance, double sure,
caused her to execute a will bequeathing him
everything she possessed, with the exception
of $DQ - each to the contestants. And while do
ing this, said Shortridge, Oscar was conscious
of the fact that in his youth he had been sup
ported by Edward, now arnjeted and unable to
do manual. work, and well .knew that he was
taking advantage, of an old mother whose mind
had broken under the weight of years.
At the conclusion of the opening . statement
Oscar, was. called to the stand.' He admitted
that for some months before her death his
mother had lived In his home. He denied,
however, that he had exercised undue Influence
over â¢ his ' demented parent and said that ehe
gave him her property -in gratitude ! for the
manner In ' which: he : had cared for her. He
was compelled to admit, however, that he did
not record gifts of stock and securities he says
were made to him by his mother I until after
his brother and sister had learned of the al
leged gifts to him. â¢
The case goes on again to-day.

SEA CAPTAIN
IS NEGLIGENT
Master of Santa Barbara
Rebuked and Puni shed for
Running His Ship Ashore
LIGHT PENALTY GIVEN
Licenses of Mates Johnson
and 'Self Suspended for
Six and Nine Months Each
\u25a0 In the matter of the stranding of the
steamship Santa Barbara near Gualala
Point on October 1 Captains Bolles and
Bulger, United States j local inspectors,
handed down a decision yesterday sus
pending the license of her master, Cap
tain Zaddart, for; three months: that
of First ' : Officer ;E. E. Johnson for six
months," and that of Second Mate ' Ar
thur Self for.nlne months. In their de
cision the; inspectors i. say: r_
. Captain Zaddart Â«ays he knew that the vessel
v.-as heading !n toward the land 1 and' would
strike It about where she did; that he gave no
orders to be called at a stated \u25a0 time or when
the iog showed a certain distance from Point
ReyeÂ«, which time and distance would have
put the vessel in a safe position, buf that he
trusted to the mate's knowledge of the weather
to call him In time. E. Â£.* Johnson, the chief
mate, cays that there was no deviation card In
tho pilot house and that ne did "not know the
magnetic course that the vessel was making.
Arthur Belf, the second mate, admits that he
knew that the vessel was three-quarters of a
point in shore of the usual course steered for.
Point Arena, and that he was on watch when
she struck on the chute near Del Mar Landing.
We find that the vessel was within two mile?
of the land for three-quarters of an hour be
fore she struck and' drawing nearer to It on an
angle before she struck. ,
After careful consideration of the evidence in
the case we are satisfied that Captain F. B.
Zaddart was unskillful and negligent In navi
gating the steamer on this occasion. In giving
a course that took the vessel on to the land,
without definite orders to be called at a stated
hour, or when she had run a certain distance
by log, and in trusting to tne knowledge of his
officers of the weather, which In this case
proved very much at fault. Also In not hav
ing a deviation tard in the pilot-house, whero
It could /be seen by the orncers of the different
watshes and also In not Instructing the mates
as to the point on the land where the course
given by him would take the vessel.

WIFE OF A CRAM COOKER
CREATES SCENE IN COURT
Bccomen Hysterical When Judce Holds
Children Shmilil Be Taken
Srrom Her. . .
With a wall tliat echoed through the cor
ridois of the City Hall, Mrs. Rot>a Vento. wife
of GluseprÂ»e ' Vento, a crab cooker, threw her
self on her knees before Judge Hebbard yester
day and with outstretched hands Implored the
court not to take from her her three children,
whom she had so sadly neglected.
Judge Hebbard said the testlmonv given
showed her unlit to have the custody of her
Children. The ttrst duty of the court was to
guard the moral and physical welfare of the
.little ones, he said. # \u25a0 \u25a0'
From the admissions of both husband and
wife It was evident that notwithstanding the
fact that they have- several thousands of dol
lars in bank, they have been living In squalor
and quarreling and fighting while their chil
dren suffered. Judge Hebbard said neither
party w^s entitled to a divorce, each being
equally to blame, but that It was evident that
the children shouuld be given Into the custody
of some charitable Institution. It was then
that Mrs. Vento save way to her emotions.
Judge Hebbard Instructed counsel to report
the facts as established by the evidence to the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Chil
dren, the court to be Informed of conditions
as the society finds them. Mre. Vento was then
allowed' to take her, children home with her,
but It may be that another order of court will
issue soon giving them Into the custody of
some . proper institution. -

SELMA, Oct. 19. â Fire destroyed
$100,000 worth of property in the Selma
packing-house district to-day, burning
to the ground the California Raisin
Growers' packing-house, where 600 tons
of choice grades of raisins were stored.
The growers' company's loss is $60,000;
the Kutner-Goldstein Company, $15,000;
C. Bachtold, $15,000; Southern Pacific,
damage to rolling stock and track,
$2600; Home Packing Company. $2500.
Most of the property destroyed is part
ly covered by insurance.
The fire broke out in the growers'
packing-house office during the absence
of the bookkeeper, who was away but
& few minutes. The safe was open and
the contents were destroyed. Half an
hour later the packing-house district
and the busihess portion of the town
was In danger, but good work by the
Fire Department, aided by citizens, who
formed a bucket brigade, saved the ad-
Joining property. The Southern Pacific
would have been a heavy loser but for
the efforts of citizens, who worked in
the scorching heat running cars from
& siding adjacent to the packing-house.
One ear was burned to the trucks.
Two children, aged 3 and 5 years, a
daughter and son of W. H. Byrne, were
severely burned about the arms and
face by the heat. They were on their
way downtown when the fire broke out
and stopped on the street opposite the
packir.g-house. The heat and confu
eion so terrified them they could do
nothing but press up against a fence
and cry. Although seventy-five feet
from the burning building, their cloth-
Ing was scorched and their tender flesh
terribly burned. Their faces and limbs,
which were more exposed than other
portions of their bodies, were, badly
blistered. Fortunately, their plight
was noticed and they were rescued
from their perilous position by spec
tators.

EFFECT OF REDUCTION'
OF THE DUTY OS TEA
All London Ready at the Hour to Re
plenish Stocks at Reduced
Rates.
Upon the stroke of midnight recently
the i eduction in the tea duty of two
pence in the pound took effect, and every
possible agency was engaged by eager
merchants in the effort to supply the
requirements of their customers In all
parts of the United Kingdom. In the
neighborhood of the bonded warehouses,
In which the tea was under the Custom
house lock and key until the first hour
of July 1, the scene from sundown until
late in the morning was unique. Every
tea dealer had restricted his orders for
weeks past with a view to releasing no
more tea from bond than he could avoid
until he could take it at-the reduced duty
of 6d per pound instead of Sd. As a
result, the merchants were deluged with
orders for July 1, and had to engage
every available van for cartage, com
mencing with tue first stroke after mid
night. To secure precedence and early
loading, the vans were ordered for early
in the afternoon, and by 8 o'clock
railway and private vehicles were assem
bling at Nicholson's wharf, although
notice had been given that the ware
house would not be opened until 6 a. m.,
\u25a0o that there would be a ten hours' wait
for the earliest arrivals.
But the chief scenes were to be wit
nessed at Butler's wharf, on the south
eide of the Thames, where as early as
4 o'clock in the afternoon the first
of the vans booked their turn. Gradually
the number of vehicles In attendance In
creased, until several hundreds were in
attendance In Shad Thames, and In ad
jacent thoroughfares.
The news had spread among the great
army of the unemployed and partially
employed that work might be found in
the neighborhood of the tea warehouses,
and they assembled In thousands, almost
begging for employment. Only a per
centage were required, however, and the
rejected hung aroundâ a discontented, un
happy mass of disappointeds, bitterly
complaining of their ill-fortune.
When midnight chimed there was an
eager rush of would-be drawers of tea.
and then followed a sometimes bitter,
sometimes humorous, chorus of com
plaint from those unable to obtain early
supplies. Inside the warehouses the or
ganization was complete, and without
apparent haste, but with great speed,
van after van received its load of forty
or more cases until over 3500 vehicles be
longing to contractors and railway com
panies had taken on board some twelve
or fifteen million pounds of tea to be
circulated by the early newspaper trains
and by road to the anxious retailers
The oldest men in the tea service de
clared the scene to be unique, and all
were anxious for the end.
There was an unprecedented rush to
clear supplies at Glasgow Customs, and
officials were in attendance from 3 o'clock
in the morning. The transit sheds of ship
ping and railway companies ' were tem
porarily converted into bonded ware
houses.âWestminster Gazette.

AN APPOINTMENT
WHICH PLEASES
Captain Charles K.MeKiii
' stry Is Now Chief of the
12th Lighthouse District
EAENS HIS PHOMOTION
Native Californian (riven
One of the- Highest Posts
in the War Department
The announcement that Captain
Charles K. McKinstry of the United
States Corps of Engineers has been ap
pointed successor to Colonel James It.
Handbury, retired, as division engineer
of Pacific Coast fortification works and
chief engineer of Twelfth District
Lighthouse Department, with head-
Quarters in this city, is received with
agreeable surprise by the large circle
of friends of the McKinstry family as
well as by the army set among whom
Captain McKinstry is extremely popu
lar.
Heretofore the office of chief of the
Twelfth Lighthouse District has been
filled by officers ranking in the higher
grades, and the appointment of Captain
McKinstry is regarded as an acknowl
edgment of special fitness, as the post
is considered one of peculiar responsi
bility and exceeded in importance by
but two others on the Atlantic Coast.
Captain McKinstry is a son of the
late Chief Justice McKinstry and a
brother of the well-known attorney, J.
C McKinstry, and was born and bred in
this city. He is a graduate of West
Point, class of '&&, and since has served
with uninterrupted distinction.
During the Spanish War he was in
charge of the fortifications at Pensa
cola and later served on special duty at
Washington, D. C. Transferred to Loa
Angeles, he has had charge of ths for
tifications and* Government improve
ments in Southern California, and to
his energy the rapid progress being
made upon the great breakwater of San
Pedro is credited. Captain McKinstry is
first on the list in the United States
army and in January next will bt- pro
moted to major.
The new chief is expected to arrive
in the city to-morrow and take imme
diate charge. Colonel Handbury will
return East as soon as his successor
arrives, and, with Mrs. Handbury, will
make an extensive tour of Europe as
soon as his private affairs will permit.
XEW JEUSEV TOW.V
INSTITUTES REFORM
Can't "Chase the Duck" Any More
Xor "Carrry the
East Orange has sounded the death
knell of the "growler," and no morn may
convivial residents of this city resurt to
the pleasant pastime of "rushin" the
growler," "chasm" de duck" or "carryin*
the mall," as has been styled the t.ct ot
carrying a can of beer from a saloon to
the point where It will do the most gjod.
Temperance workers, the vt.rioua
church societies and the Board of Excise
have all deliberated upon the can trade
problem and how it could be brokÂ«3 up,
but no solution was ever reached. A lit
tle while ago the proposition was submit
ted to City Attorney Jerome Dudley Ged
ney, and he solved it in a jiffy; in fact,
Mr. Gedney did it in about a minute after
he had read the excise regulations. Li
censes are issued which allow the drink
ing of unlimited liquor on the saloon
premises, but the keeper may not sell
more than a quart to be drunk oiT the
premises.
When the can customer goes to the
saloon for his "pint" he always receives
more than a quart, and in Mr. Gedney's
opinion no holder of a saloon .license may
sell ale or beer in quantities of more than
one quart, except to be drunk on the
premises. This will shrink the "pints" to
such limited proportions that it is figured
they will cease to become popular and
their purchase will discontinue.
In connection with this it has been pro
posed to equip the members of the police
force with pretty, polished quart meas
ures in order that they may stop persons
"carrying the mail," to see if the can con
tains more than a quart of beer or ale.
In doing this it would be necessary for
the officer to establish beyond all doubt
that the contents of the pail were either
beer or ale, and on the hot nights when
the can trade is brisk this is expected to
be a pleasant and conscientiously ob
served duty.â New Tork Tribune.
Kansas and Her Abundance.
What a wonderful State is Kansas and
what a remarkable history she has. Only
a short time ago she was harvesting a
record-breaking wheat crop and scouring
the country for hands. The search ex
tended as far as New ~Jk>rk and even col
lege boys were induced to take a ;ob.
Wages were put at the top notch and the
"keep" during the engagement was of
the best. As prices were good the faim
ers must all have grown fat. And now,
a month or two later, comes this story
from Topeka: "Kansas farmers will in
a few days begin harvesting the most
valuable corn crop ever grown In the
State. The lowest estimate of the yield
is 250,000,000 bushels, wkile corn experts
say It will go 25,000,000 bushels above that
figure. At the present price the corn
crop will net the farmers of Kansas $T5,
000,000. The Kansas banks are loaded
with money and farmers are buying au
tomobiles and modernizing their homes."
âWashington Star.
Publicity as to Campaign Account*.
Less money, cleaner money, money
more easily traced from source to final
use^ â that will be the goal of a winning
movement for the purification of cam
paigns and the uplifting of politics.
Publicity is the road to reform. Light
will banish the miasma of bribery and
burn away the swamp vapors of
"graft." The way to get results is to
enforce the publication of campaign ac
counts. Committees must be made to
show where they get their funds, how
much they receive, what they spend
and for what purpose. In the last
analysis it is as proper a subject for
publicity as the transactions of the.na
tional government. â Cleveland Leader.

Is Always Present Danger
of Fishing Up Eival Line
Fifteen cables stretch across the bed
of the Atlantic and. though four oâ¬ them
are "dead" they still enter into all the
calculations of the repairers, because in
the region of the Grand Banks, where
several lines are laid near or : over each
other, a mistake in judgment may mean
bringing to the surface a "dead" cable
or one belonging . to , another company
which Is undamaged and very much
"alive," as the unlucky skipper will learn
when he reaches port and finds awaiting
him a red-hot protest from the people
whose line he had interfered with and,
sometimes, rendered temporarily useless.
This arises from the fact that* ln splic
ing the cable after cutting itâ for it must
be cut by a mechanical grapnel, and one
end gripped by it and brought to the
surface, as the strain would otherwise
cause it to break on the grapnel and both
ends be lost â the splicing may be badly
done and the. line cease to work; and
this he cannot know till he returns to
port, because the splicing and insulating
of the cable shut him off from any
knowledge of its condition.
MAY BREAK OTHER CABLES.
If. he finds on making harbor that it Is
not working he must go out and . seek
for it again to make a better job of it,
and, in the endeavor to accomplish this,
may work mishap to another cable or
more than one, until the whole fra
ternity of cable operators on both , sides
of the ocean are crying for his blood by
the few electric conduits that remain un
injured.
It may not be generally known that It
is possible to locate from a cable office
on shore the break in mid-ocean to with
in half a mile of the exact spot. This is
ascertained through the fact that the
sensitive instruments used record the
"resistance" of the cable when working
properly and also the "resistance" of the
portion between the office and the break,
so it is simply a matter of calculation to
Inform the skipper of the repair ship that
the break Is 1142 miles from New York,
Boston, Halifax or St. Johns, as the case
may be.
The ship then sails for that locality, his
reckoning discloses to the captain when
he is near the scene, the chart on which
the route of the cable was plotted when
It was originally laid enables him to dis
cover its approximate latitude and longi
tude in that area, and thus fortified "he
usually brings it to the surface at the
first cast of the grapnel. Then his elec
tricians connect the exposed "nerve"
with their instruments and "call" the
station they have left.
OTHER EXD PICKED UP.
If It answers they know that half of
the line is in good order, and pealing up
the end they buoy it on the water and go
in the other direction till they think they
have overshot the break, when the ship
makes another cast of her grapnel and
hooks the other section.
This is then hauled up, connected as
before, the other shore station is "called"
and if it responds a. new section -of ''cable
is spliced to that end, and paying out as
she goes the ship returns to the end she
has buoyed, makes another splice of the
new end with that and lowers the pre
sumably -perfected cable back into its
ocean bed.
Nor is the repairing aa [quickly or easily
accomplished always as in the above ex
ample, when everything goes favorably.
Often storms arise, drive the ship from
her course, tear the buoys from the ends
they are fastened to and compel. the whole
work to be done over again.
In midwinter these conditions are felt
at their worst. The ship becomes thickly
encrusted with Ice, it is difficult to ma
neuver her and doubly so to deal with a
cable on bow or stern when the roll of the
seas threaten to fracture it again. The
launching of boats with men in them to
buoy a loose end is positively hazardous.
FIGHTIA'G THE HURRICANES.
From these causes occasionally cable
ships get short of coal and have to aban
don work at the most critical periods and
bear up for port, or they are enmeshed
among the Ice floes or bergs and have to
let go all and retreat, or the storms crip
ple them In their machinery or deck gear
and a like result ensues. The fierce hur
ricanes which scourge the North Atlantic
every winter try the merits of marine
material as nothing else can, and the
storms these cable ships have to endure
at this season are such that only the
stanchest fabrics could withstand.
Some serious and costly failures to ef
fect cable repairs have occurred on the
Grand Banks. One instance Is recorded of
a break which cost 116 days and $375,000
to make good; another occupied eighty
seven days and cost $230,000, and a third
eighty-one days and almost a similar sum.
It takes fully twenty-four hours to grap
ple and lift a cable from 2000 fathoms of
water, and as the strain caused by the
ship pitching often causes a , new break
it is easily seen that the existence of fine
weather is essential to success.
The maintenance of a cable ship costs
$1500 a day, exclusive of the cost, of the
cable which has to be used to make the
splice, which in some cases runs from
150 to 800 miles, according to the luck in
the weather and making connections, and,
at the figure of $750 to $1000 a mile,, which
deep sea cables are worth, it is not,diffi
cult to estimate the amount that a com
pany will drop In a repairing venture un
attended with good luck. \u25a0' â¢;/ "
OXB JOB COST Â«800,000.
What stands alone In cable repairing
annals is the extraordinary case , of the
1874 line "which, owing to a* series of unfor
tunate mishaps," occupied more than* a
year and , cost almost $500,000, or about
one-fourth of its original cost. Ordinarily,
however, it is estimated that the repairs
of every working Atlantic cable cost $40,
000 a year. After thirty years a cable de
teriorates, so fronti natural causes, that -It
becomes cheaper to lay a new one than
to repair that In, use.
In the earlier days of submarine telegra
phy It was found "necessary to abandon
50 per cent of the deep sea" cables within
.twelve years of their being laid. It has
been found possible to j construct j cables
so as to lengthen their existence,consid
erably, and when cables "break in their
early. years, in waters where icebergs,
trawlers' anchors, = seismic â¢- disturbances
and kindred 1 causes are not possible, their
fracturing is due to their being badly, laid,
sections being suspended over irregularly
ties of the bottom and breaking apart
from abrasions due to the currents acting
thereon. v ; â¢\u25a0
A few years ago an "Atlantic cable, was
repaired twice In the same winter, though
only four years '. old, - the! trouble on- both
occasions being due ; to ; this \ cause. Two
years back two other: cables were
in deeper water: and s seismic action 'â¢' was
eal'd \u25a0 to be . the "cause, ..but ; the ; men!; who
made; the" repairs were satisfied that the
mishaps were due to bad laying of these
lines. *

HERALDIC SINGS
AMONG INDIANS
Painted Figures on the Face
Have Special Meaning 1 Like
Armorial Bearings of Old
EASY TO UNDERSTAND
Copper Bed on Lips Showed
Wealth in Mines, Pearl Disk
Implied DescentFromMoon
"People in * general .have been content
to look , upon ! the Indian's adornment of
his head with eagle feathers and his face
with- paint as marks of personal decora
tion, ; inspired by vanity and a savage
taste! -different only in degree from; what
is sometimes * witnessed among highly
civilized peoples," remarked a scientist of
the bureau of ethnology. "But the fact
Is," he continued, "that In . reference to
the latter, custom, for instance, every
paint mark on an Indian's face has a
sort of heraldic meaning, implying not
only the honors won by the brave in
person, but representing also the claims
of his family and race to distinction. In
other words, what Is shown among more
cultured communities by coats of arms;
orders and decorations is depicted by, th*
Indian on his face by means of pigments.
DESCENT . FROM THE 3 MOON.
'.'Scientists of this bureau are now en
gaged, among other- novel investigations
concerning the North American Indian,
in compiling a record of the ' armorial,
or. rather, facial, bearings of certain cel
ebrated chiefs and it is found to be fas
cinating work. One renowned warrior,
for instance, will have his lip painted a
copper red. This is found to indicate
that his tribe was once in possession of
huge mines of copper, i
"Another . individual will have his* fore
head adorned with a painting of a certain
fish, thus implying that he or his people
are renowned for prowess in catching
fish. The same distinguished person
sometimes wears a disk of .pearl in adV
dltion to his paint mask. This by its
shimmering radiance and its form implies
that he is descended . from the moon in
the sense that the goddess of night is one
of his ancestors.
"The fact that the Indian artist has no
cenception of perspective, seriously han
dicaps the success of his pictorial efforts.
Ind-eed, the Indian limner merely aims
to show the most characteristic portion
of the object he attempts to depict, un
less he be a man of unusual attainment's,
in which case he divides and dissects the
subject of his picture and represents the
whole by its parts, the latter being 1 ar
ranged entirely irrespective of the nat
ural sequence, so that properly to under
stand a natlvÂ« Indian picture would re
quire a course in a specialized branch of
art criticism. :: J â¢:*-?;
"The exceedingly arbitrary methods of
the Indian artist render it difficult, if not
wholly impossible, for any but an expert
to interpret the meanings of the pictorial
representations.
DEPART FROM NATURE.
"Thus, the animal's ears are invaria
bly depicted above the eyes on the human
subject, the cars of the beaver being
just above the eyebrows. On the cheeks
are , painted the paws In a position as
if they were raised to the mouth in the
manner conventional in Indian carv
ings.
"The dogfish painted in red on" the face
designates the members of an entire
tribe. -On the foreheads of the members
of this tribe is painted the long, thin
snout; the gills are represented by two
curved lines below the eyes, while the
tall is shown as cut in two and hanging
from each nostril. Only one or two parts
of an animal painted on an Indian's face
indicates that he is of inferior position;
the entire symbol, no matter In what
form presented, is significant of lofty sta
tion and high honors.
"This facial heraldry of the Indians
may be said to be unique not alone in
the method of representation employed,
but in the subjects selected. These lat
ter include fish, flesh and fowl of all
descriptions â dog salmon, devilfish,
starfish, woodpeckers, ravens, eagles,
bears, wolves and frogs are. comprised
in the armorial gallery.
"Every object represented has its own
particular significance â- and one of the
most peculiar phases of face- painting re
lates to the employment of. forms other
than animal â tools, implements of the
chase, of war, denoting the occupation of
the individual or his tribe, etc."
Alphabetical Cemetery.
The Necropolia Cemetery, Glasgow, as
originally planned, contained almost ex
actly twenty-four - acres available for
burials, and it was suggested that each
division of one acre should be named
after a letter of the Greek alphabet,
which contained : twenty-four characters.
For various reasons this idea has not been
fully carried out, but- fifteen -sections of
the cemetery have been so named from
alpha to omega, the monosyllable letters
between these being omitted. The names
have not been applied Jin any particular
sequence, but with the aid of a small map
they are useful in locating any particular
epot in what la now one of the most
densely filled graveyards in the kingdom.

Money and Stocks.
J. S. Bache & Co. say in their New York
circular:
No cne doubts for a moment that over
â¢peculatlon is dangerous, but there has, as
TH, been no over-speculation, nor is there any
J^-*e amount cf stock held in weak hands. On
v.'i recent sharp decline very little long stock
cm^r.t out end the bears, hastening to cover.
"cM up crlces en themselves. The buying on
the decline locked much better than the selling.
One of the features of the market has been
the excellent demand for low-priced industrial
shares. etet-i stock* have remained in good
demand, acd the market on the United States
StÂ«-el commr.a Â«tock is broad and active.
The business situation continues to Fhow im
provement, stimulated by the harvesting of
our Â«normout crops. Bteel and iron are in
better demand, ned all the iron, steel and
equipment companies are doing an excellent
business at increasing trices. It is estimated
that the EteÂ«l Corporation for the year will
cam about $117,000,000 net, or 60 per cent
greater Uian In 1904.
For the immediate future the market will in
ail probability continue dull and professional
until Â«uch time as money rates fall below
ineir present level. With blgh-jirlced railroad
issues netting less than 4 per cent it is hard
to Induce Â«peculatlve buying co long as money
remains at 6 per cent. Were it net for this
circumstance it la probable the Great Northern
"â¢melon" of 38 per cent would have had a
more favorable Influence on prices. Hencs
speculation Is apt to extend more and mere to
:ow-pr:ced Issuer.. We feel that urices will
work hirher !n time, but the market Is In a
nervous condition, and any unfavorable de
velopment might cause a break ct two or three
points. Purchases of low-priced issues on re
cessions and profit-taking on rallies will prob
ably prove profitable during the next few
wÂ«eka.

NEW YORK, Oct. 19.â The stock market re
mains In professional hands and the cifflculty
of gettiug r.rlces far from a given level con
tinues. By extending the declines in force y<-s
terday through the early part of the day a
vantage point was obtained for the later re
over)' a^d the day* ex-.rÂ«me movement in
consequence was rather wld*r than had been
the rule lately. The attraction to traders was
thereby Increased and the market gained eodiÂ«
animation. It did not appear that there was
any reflection in the market of outside de
velopments. The lattr improvement of the day
was connected probably as much as anything
with the relaxation of the tension in the money
market. This was true cf conditions abroad,
as well as in this country, out the active de
mand for credits in connection with the de
gree of enterprise was undiminiÂ«hed. The im
mediate Blight relaxation in the money situa
tion was not convincing therefore of any early
return of marked ea?e. Tne retention of the
Bank of England rate Â«eemed to have been
discounted In speculative markets. The weekly
return of that institution showed that the re- ',
ruperation had been achieved by th* purchase
of bullion at an advance in the bidding mar
ket and by borrowing- funds from the open
market, aÂ« reflected in the decrease of Gov
ernment securities. The expansion of over
${â¢,000,000 In the loan account, however, lndl
etted a new demand on tne Government lnsti
â¢ tutlon for credite Incident to the rise in the
c;-ea market discount rate to above the bank
re'-e. Tre price of gold was let down a frac
tion In the London market and sterling ex
cfcance at jjar. in Berlin moved In favor of
I. .cor.. The discount rate at Berlin was also
n.l tr, but hardened at Paris to a flat 3 per
c^ut. There was lees urgent demand here Jor
r j4 '.gn Â«xchE.n*e and the rate ran cCf In the
â¢Tvy flealinga. but showed later etrength.
Tte Sub-Treasury operations are yielding a re
turn to the tr.r.Vis en account of the mid
monthly swelling- of the pension pay rolls.
There teema to be a lull al*o in the heavy cus
toms receipts which have been going into the
Sub-Treesury. New York exchange also rote
again to-day to 15 cer.t* premium, which Is the
I'iShcÃt of. the season, indicating a coesajjen
of^pressure from that point on New York in
currency. The recent drain- on the bank re
serves thus Mcmt to be reiievd for the time
tKlr.g. There was some selling of stocks yes
terday and early to-day en a professed appre
hension of the effect of the President's re
mark* at Halelgh on the nubject of railroad
rate lesielation. feme early uneasiness over
the sensational effect cf the Allegheny benk
'allure was also relieved on further considera
tion. The movement toward recovery was uicnt
pronounced In a group of Industrial epeclaltien.
n#portÂ» of traffic blockades on the railroads
both in the rrain rt-Klons and in the Iron and
steel Industrial centers and the resulting urg
ent demand' for additional rAi!road equipment
hVlped the railroad equipment stocks and the In
<]Â«rÂ«rdent Iron and t-tcel industrials genyally.
Arr.aUtair.ated Copper was rather quiet, but
was 'nciineJ to neavlnesn on the failure to ad
\u25a0 van.-c the dividend rate, aÂ« there had been
Â«rÂ»rr.< buvlnr of the stock in the expectation
of ati irlcrfaÂ«e. The presence In the city of
the Sf-cretavy cf the Treasury ga%e riÃe to the
uÂ«uÂ«l &lKcvttlor. of the likelihood of Govern- :

Sew York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. IÂ«.â COTTONâ The morÂ«
favorable character of Liverpool advices and
continued- heavy spot buying in that market,
supplemented by wet weather' and predictions
of colder and lreezing weather in the South
western part of the cotton belt, resulted In a
very substantial advance of from 17 to 24
points In our market to-day. Reports of bad
weather to-morrow may influence another up
ward movement in prices, but conservatism on
the buying side is in order.
Spot markets in the South, were strong, with
a large demand. The situation is very strong
on account of the sudden change of sentiment
brought about by the Giles estimate of 10,
3U0.000 bales*
Theodore Price says: "From several sources
I learn that reports are being circulated that
lam about to issue a bullish circular. Such is
not the case. I think it will be found that the
reaction which the market' has had at this
morning's prices is about the limit of its pres
ent possibilities in an upward direction. Ten
cents for cotton 1b not at all cheap, and with
a big surplus in the hands of spinners, the
invisible supply and. the- large stock in New
York it will require more evidence of crop de
ficiency than is at present apparent to make
a bull of me."

the news c.i the <iay was generally, bul.ish.
At the start December was a shade *ow;.i

set the market was subjected to persistent sell
ing pressure from a number of commission
houses. Part of' the selling was tnought to
be for the account of a leading ions- Ab
trading progressed pit traders and small holders
became uctive .sel.ers and increased .the weak
ness. Ab'jiu the only news of a baarish natare
was a rerort denying that the Argentine
wheat crop had been seriously damaged by
locusts. On the other hand bullish factors
were quite numerous. Weather wan extie;nely
unfavorable for the movement' of the ne*

Potatoes, Onions aicrl Vegetable*.
The market for river Potatoes continued very
much dtpreaeed, with only the fanciest offer
ings receiving attention. Salinas .Burbanks
continued to meet with a brisk demand at firm
prices and the market was practically bare of
good stock at the close. Two canoads of
Merced Sweet Potatoes came in, causing an
easier market. ' Onions ruled* firm under mod
erate arrivals and a good speculative demand.
Miscellaneous vegetables were in good de
mand and generally steady, Lima Beans and
Egg Plant being the only exceptions. String
Beans, Cucumbers and Okra were higher.

Poultry and Game.
The Poultry market was liberally Â»uppl!el
and generally easy, but there was no actaal
decline in prices. , Hens were the weakest
feature and quite a few coops of that descrip
tion had to be held over. â¢- Receipts consisted
of 120 coops of domestic stock and a carloid
of Western. Arrivals of Game were rather
light, but' there was no particularly brisk de

Butter, Cheese and Esgti.
The different markets under this head con
tinued steady to firm yesterday, with all choice
graces cleaned up and in demand. There was
a disposition among 'sellers to go slowly, how
ever, as It was feared that a further advance
might result In a. reaction toward lower price e.
Some houses . quoted - 44c for the best ranch
Eggs, but they were In the minority, and such
sales were not. only few. but of a retail char
acter. Receipts continued to diminish.
Receipts were 21,400 lbs Butter, 409 cases
Eggs and 44,800 lbs Cheese.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
A feature of the market was the arrival of
20 boxes of new crop Grape Fruit from Tulare
County. The fruit was offered at $3 50Â®4 per
box, but -found few takers, being too green to
attract trade. Otherwise there was nothing
new to report In Citrus goods. Dullness con
tinued to characterize \u25a0 the ' Apple market and
there was very, little business reported at the
top quotation, 00c per box being about the
top for the general run of fancy stock. Sup
plies'of the other tree fruits were extremely
light and firm prices ruled for all descriptions.
Melons were plentiful and dull, with the cool
weather still operating against trade. Grapes
continued to weaken under heavy arrivals, par
ticularly from Martinez and - Stockton, and
there was a heavy surplus of all kinds, save
Isabella, still unsold at the close.- There was
practically no . market for Wine Grapes, and
for poor stock no reasonable offer was refused.
Berries were' In light but ample supply and
all varieties had a downward tendency.
