typhus fever followed, wrecking his
health. Tuberculosis . developed and he
came to Colorado two years ago.
Had it not been for the Spanish-Amer
ican War Veterans in this city, who knew
him and his career, Frawley would have
suffered thn pangs of hunger while dying

tell his relatives of his condition. The

Wyman -voted his own name and -that of
S. H. Mann, gave testimony that sounded
like that of imbeciles, though each seem
ed trying his best to testify as strongly
as possible against Maestretti. It is said
"that their testimony for Wyman . helped
convict that individual and that their tes
timony and their general [ I appear

to liberty, even if they ; do their best

BERLIN. June 6. â Crown Prince
Frederick "William and Duchess Ce
cilia of Mecklenburgr-Schwerin were
married in the palac-5 chape! this af-
The singularity of the relationship bÂ«
cornfi? apparent when it. was known that
Mrs. .Asay formerly was one of the most
Fpectscular lijures of Chicago's half
world. Twelve years ago she was mar-,
ried to Edward G. Asay Jr.. who is now
in mercantile business in the Philippine
Islands. At the time of her marriage the
\u25a0woman was a dashing divorcee who had
caste and social standing. At the end of
five years Asay was divorced from her.
Then rhe drifted into a fast life.
How Kirnberly came to know her is
not clear, but soon after her meeting
with the venerable millionaire she shook
the du?t of her old haunts from her feet,
cut her forir.er friends, moved into ele
gant quarters in the fashionable Vir
ginia apartments and settled down to a
life of outward respectability.
Kimberly was a director in the Republic
Iron and Steel Company. He was inter
ested in iron and coal mines in the Lake
Superior region and in gold arid silver
mines in the West. He was interested in
a vast irrigation scheme in Utah with F.
H. Buhl- of Sharon. Pa., and in California
mining ventures. He was never married
as far as is known.
Kirrsberiy had lived in Mrs. Asay's
apartments in the Virginia, building for
four years. The only person who lived
in the flat with them was Mrs. Asay's
rr.asd. They lived in luxurious style. They
left their neighbors strictly alone and
were left alone in return.
CHICAGO, June 6.â Speculation is rife
among the friends of the late Peter L.
Kirnberly, who died on Monday in the
apartments of Mrs. Elizabeth V. Asay,
at 4535 Drexel boulevard, regarding the
disposition of his fortune of $10,000,000.
Mrs. Asay accompanied the body of the
dead millionaire to his family home at
Sharon, Pa., this morning. Before she
left. Mrs. Asay told her friends that she
would inherit the bulk of this vast estate.
It is believed the relatives of Kimberley
will fight the claim which she is expected
to make or 'go to law to break the will
if it is found that he has bequeathed his
fortune to her.
The aged lawyer heard the price of
fered and laughingly asked how Read
had obtained such figures. After Read
had explained, Silliman remarked:
"But I forgot to tell you to stand the
dollars on edge."
Ten years ago he repeated to Read the
terms at which he would sell, but he
said then that gold dollars instead of
silver dollars would have to be used.
"For how much?*? asked Read. "
"Well," Silliman' said, "you cover it
over with dollars and you can have it. "-
Read figured how much space a silver
dollar would occupy and then how many

NEW YORK, June 6.â Establishing a
new high record for a square foot of
Xew York City real estateâ ss9B 20â the
property at the southeast corner of "Wall
street and Broadway, . opposite Trinity
i Church, a lot thirty feet in Broadway by
thirty-nine feet in Wall street, was sold
to-day for $700,000. It has long; been re
garded as the most valuable plat in the
western hemisphere.
The purchase of this property marks
the entrance into the New York realty
market of a St. Louis corporation, the
representative of which, Lorenzo E. An
derson, negotiated the sale. Benjamin
D. Silliman, i who died four years ago,
at the age of ninety-seven years, was.
during most of his life, the owner of
the property, and it 4s now sold by his
estate.
The regard in which Silliman held the
property can best be seen through an In
cident which occurred almost forty years
ago.. At they time. George R. Read, a
young * man, j was . ejijering cm . his career
as a real estate broker. He" desired .to
sell large property and finally singled \l
out this plot. He went to Silliman and]
asked him if he would sell. j
"Yes," replied the owYier." " I'll sell it." . !

GRAND DUKES 'WANT PEACE;
WASHINGTON, June 6.â Pending the
decision -of the Czar regarding-- war- or
peace In the Far East, the President and
the European Embassadors with whom he
Is daily conferring have agreed that
silence regarding their activities -Is nece3
t>ary. and word to this effect has been
passed along, lest Russia take offense and
go contrary tQ what the neutral powers
relieve- to' be" for her own ! ,advantag<Â»/ \u25a0 : â¢
Coimt Cassinl. the Russian Embassador,
remains without advices from St. Peters
burg that throw ' any Ugh t on^ the \ prob
able policy of the" Czar. The Embassador
has not yet received an acknowledgment
cf his long cablegram of l^st week re
garding* his -"conference with" the Presi
dent. The cablegram was sent not for the
purpose of transmitting any message to
the Czar, but, acting on his own initia
tive, the Embassador made a faithful re
port of what was described at the' time
as "Informal and general conversation."
No formal tender of mediation "was made,
nor was any reported. The Etnbaseador,
however,' felt that his Government should
be Informed of the views expressed by the
President In favor of peace, and' there
fore incorporated them In his cablegram.
It is expected that later on the. Russian
Embassy here will be Informed whether '
the result of the battle in the sea of Japan
has affected the determination of the ' St.
Petersburg Government to continue , the
war.. Any Information on this subject will
be promptly placed before the President.
v Peace talk, was temporarily supplanted
In diplomatic circles to-day by comment
upon .the resignatlr.n of Delcasse and the
developments In the MÂ° roccan situation.
It is believed. here, however, that the ef
fect of ; th^ retirement of th'e> dls'tlnguishd
diplomatist will be to increase 'the oppor^
turn ty of ' the President anil the Embassa
dors at Washington r ln "their- efforts; to
ward peace negotiations.* Commenting on
this to-night; a European-diplomat' said:
"While Delcasse was at | the head of the
French Foreign Office, his intimacy with
Lord LansdoWne gave *to London and
Paris a splendid opportunity for concerted
action \u25a0 that- would influce -^ Russia" and
Japan to talk of peace. L , The' retirement of
Delca'sse must necessarily have , an " effect
upon the Anglo-Fronch entente, as well
as the Franco-Russian alliance/ Not only"
was Delcasse largely responsible for !the
former, but he \u25a0 was generally ) recognized
as â¢the best friend Russia Â» possessed 'In

Dr. Dryander, the court chaplain, with
nine of the cathedral clergy standing near
him, ' began the service. It is the privilege,
of the pastor, according to the liutheran
rite. 'to read either one of the several
admonitory addresses to the bridal couple
or' to make one of his own. Dr. Dryander
elected' to lay aside the book, taking as
his subject the book of Ruth, Chapter 1.
verses 16 and 17, beginning: "For whither
thou goest, I will go." /
Dr.. Dryander spoke briefly on the
beauty of love, the large responsibilities
resting on the youthful pair, their need
for support of faith and spiritual . vision."
The pastor then asked his Imperial High
ness if he took put of God's. hand to have
arid to hold according to God's word and
will, her Highness Cecilia, The Crown
Prince answered "yes." The same ques
tion was addressed to the Duchess with
the additional question of "and obey,"
to which she also answered "yes." These <
were the only responses. ' .'
The rings were then "exchanged and the
brido and groom knelt while Dr. Dryander
read the liturgical prayer, closing the cer-;
emdny. which had taken precisely twenty
minutes. -
Dr. Dryander shook hands with . the
Crown Prince and kissed the hand of the
Crown "Princess. He then presented the
bridal couple with a Bible richly bound.
The Emperor kissed the bride on both
cheeks and then kissed his son, the Em
press doing likewise. The bridal party
slowly moved ..out, followed by the
Princes and Princesses, but all others
waited in the chapel, whleh had become
very hot. owing to the. 300 candles that
had .been burning for half an hour.

Egan had aill charge. of. ail these ship
ments and-^uqceÃSfully concealed his
identity with* ttiejn until' a few days ago,
\u25a0when the ernproyes of" the Pacific Mall
dotk became aware of fact that he
was furnishing a large' quantity â¢ of
freight, the nature* of which was found
to be of a contraband character. The
firm that Egarn represents Is said to have
handled millions of dollars for the Toklo
Government and disbursed" the greater
part of this money in this f conntry.
At the Palace Hotel Egun Is known
&b a commercial traveler. &nd during
his stay here he has avoided all at
tempts to draw him into conversation
regarding the war in the Far East, even
though- he had reason to believe that
his acquaintances discussed It as a pop
ular subject. He -Is an Irishman by
birth and has been connected with Fa
kata & Co. for a number of years. He j
vrs.s absent from the Palace the greater j
part of yesterday and a search for. him
revealed the fact that he was at the
Mall dock- arranging for a shipment of
"freight" on the JloÃgolla, which leaves
for Japanese,iÂ»orts to-day. When he re
turned to the hotel he went directly to
his room and refused to see anybody.'
Fakata & Co. not only operated at this
port 'Jjut trave shipped tons of war ma
terial from Seattle and Victoria, and their
only failure was the refusal of the local
customs authorities to clear the liner
Ad.-Hi/ : with â¢ her contraband cargo- of
shells. These were landed on the wharf
ancfj the Adato, about three 'weeks ago,
departed for; Japan, and since then the
shipment of shells has disappeared.' Ac
cojdiug to report. tney were shipped north
ari.d. are now en their way to the Orient.
Fakata & Co., who have agencies all
over the world, negotiated for the con
struction of these .^ats through various
mediums in the East and in London and
as fast as the boats were ready for
shipment they were forwarded to San
Francisco, where Egan saw to It that
they were placed aboard the steamers
bound for the Orient. On several oc
casions, it is said, he had the ,parts of
these boats, that were marked as- ma
chinery, shipped to Honolulu, and there
reshipped to Japan.
tvory time that a Pacific Mail steamer
has departed from this port Egan has
been an anxious spectator at the dock
and when the vessel disappeared through
the Golden Gate he has hurried up town

announcing another success of his mis
sion; . . ;

tive ol the Japanese firm of Fakata &
Co.' Of AlOA 10 .Wall street, New York, who
have been the medium through which
Japan !us been purchasing her mate
rial for warfare. It was Egan's per
sonal ingenuity that made successful
t!w>- repeated shipments of ammunition
and other contraband of war to the
Orient. It was he who attempted to
ship to Japan on the liner Adato a car
go of shells, for the big guns of the
Japanese navy, and failing in this ef
fort hud them sent to the Far East by
another route. Previous to this move
ment he UAd sent thousands of tons of
material to the Mikado's realm, and
it is genf-raUy understood that he is
still engaged. in the same business.
Pledged to secrecy, Egan naturally
is avoiding Interviews and when he
learned yesterday that his connection \
with the* firm of Fakata & Co. and his
mission here had become known, he
hied himself to his apartments In the
IVlace Hotel and not only refused to
be seen by representatives of the press,
but would not answer his telephone.
Protn other sources, however, it was
learned that the sole purpose of his
visit to Sun Francisco was to see that
certain shipments of munitions of war
were safely placed aboard of the out
going Oriental steamers.

France. His resignation l , was submitted
at a meeting of the Council of Ministers
held at the Ely see palace, under the
presidency of President Loubet. The

Governor Wright was advised that
the President directed that the twenty

forced; that necessary supplies and
coal must be taken on within that
time, these instructions being con
sistent with those of -June 5, stating,
that, as the Russian admiral's I ships
were suffering from damage due to
battle, the American policy was too re

were of greater range than those of
the Russians, their heavy shells flying
over the battleship division and strik
ing the transports and the unarmored
cruisers beyond. -V> ?;.'', v;>vV\'
The Russian ships had enough* coal
to reach Vladivostok, but there was an
inadequate supply of shells and; am
munition for a prolonged battle, where
as the Japanese, operating near their
base, were not under the necessity of
stowing away enormous quantities of
coal and could carry a double quantity
of shells or replenish their ammunition
from auxiliary vessels.
The Russian officers assert that the
ships surviving the first day's battle
must have been practically out of am
munition.
Reports have been received at army
headquarters from Vladivostok indicat
ing that the naval defeat was due
largely to lack of leadership after Ro-
Jestvensky was wounded, the engage
ment having been carried on practically
without signals after the first hour and
no attempt having been made to adapt
the movements of the fleet to meet the
maneuvers of the Japanese. Nohody on
board any vessel in the fleet was in the
secret as to RojeÃtvensky's plans, 'the
Commander-in-chief s only confidant
being Rear- Admiral Voelkersam. who
died early in the fight.

No one in the fleet' cherished any. illu

as dearly as possible for every ship
lost. The hopes of the Russians went
no further than this. \u25a0 ' ;

C. â Undismayed by Rojestvensky's

the outcome of the approaching
battle. Lieutenant General Linevitch is
for war to the bitter end, and he be
lieves that the Manchurian army Is
now strong enough to assume the ag
gressive. â¢ . .
To a question put to him by a corre
spondent, to whom' he granted an In
terview to-day, as to whether he was
for 'war or peace, the commander-ln
chief replied firmly and without the
slightest hesitation:
"Most -certainly lam for war. I am
a soldier. The Emperor's will is natur
ally'my law, but my voice" now, as be
fore, is for the continuance of the
fight. . :
"With the destruction of our fleet'
vanishes, of course, the hopes of those
who at the beginning of the war wish
ed to make peace at Toklo, but our
defeat at sea has not Interfered with
my plans â absolutely not one whit. I
consider myself strong. enough not only
to hold any ground, but even to ad
vance.
"I am no prophet and have no desire

can and will defeat the Japanese in
Manchuria. ? T "\u25a0 ..
"I have asked the War OOce to send
me reservists of the younger classes
instead of older ones, not because the

with plenty of young and vigorous re

Inadvisable to call the older men from
their more settled life."

UKIAH, June 6.â John Rhodes fell to
his. death down the grade between
Union and Juan creeks, near Fort
Bragg, last | Saturday. He was return
ing to the camp at which he was em
ployed and in the dark walked too
close to the edge of the grade. The
ground slid â¢ from under . him and â¢he
fell "a distance of fifty feet to the rocks
below. He struck on his head and
never -recovered consciousness. Rhodes
was 23 years of- age and formerly re
sided in Hopland, this county. - \u25a0
Pedestrian Meets Death on Grade Near
Fort Bran.
FALLS FIFTY FEET.
OAKLAND, Juner 6- â Charles .A.
Bailey, - who met a sudden death while
on a . vacation trip ' to Yosemite Valley,
was one of- the best known real estate
'dealers of Alameda County for many
years. He was a native of Wisconsin,
and 'came to California in; the early
sixties.- From 1867 to 1873 he held the
position :\u25a0 of : ' cashier \u25a0 for Huntington,
Hopkins & Co.. of Sacramento. In the
latter year he came to this city and at
once Invested 5 his entire- fortune in
Berkeley real estate. " which, as it in
creased in value, gave him an ample
competence. :
He was an enthusiastic lover of the
Yosemite Valley. He wrote several
articles descriptive of its beauty, and
there is now awaiting publication a
book on the valley written by him.
Bailey began his last trip to the val
ley on May 31. He had often, despite
his age, expressed a desire to scale the
face of El Capitan. As yet It is not
known whether he lost his life in an
attempt to do so.
Bailey resided with his family at 1387
Harrison street. He leaves a widow,
Mrs. Alice "B. Bailey, two sons, Ray
mond and Bryant, and a daughter,- Miss
Cora Bailey.-. '
The party searching for the body of
Baily located it at 11 o'clock to-day. J.
A. Snell of Calistoga and H. Spaulding
and F. Curry, of Palo Alto, were lowered
by a rope 600 feet and by 1 o'clock had
brought the corpse to a point where It
could be taken by others. The body was
badly mangled and most of the larger
bones were broken. ", It is being embalmed
and will be sent to his home in Oakland.
\u25a0 Early . this morning Warden Harlow
and Dr/ Martin H. Fischer of San Fran
cisco, with a large force of .men.
started with Staats for the scene of the
tragedy.
This is the first fatality to a tour
ist ever recorded here. Bailey had Just
returned from a fourteen months^ trip
around the world, during whlch^- he
had climbed the Matterhorn and other
mountains. He has visited Yosemite
for, sixteen consecutive summers and
was the. discoverer of Sierra Point. He
was an indefatigable mountain
climber, though 59 years of age. Staats
is about 22 years old.
Bailey and Staats tried to make a
record climb up the face of a cliff
west of El Capitan. They started early
this morning up the almost perpendicu
lar-face of the cliff where there Is no
trail and where man has never placed
foot before About 3 o'clock they had
accomplished about half of the 30.00
feet of ascent and had halted for
breath. Bailey was sitting on a nar
row v shelf and Staats was clinging to
the face of the rock below. Suddenly
Bailey began to slide. He shot down
ward a few feet to Staats' left, and fell
headlong out of sight, striking his
head several times before he disap
peared.
Staats was horror-stricken, but gath
ering courage he climbed down to a
point where he found Bailey's hat and
a I blood-bespattered rock. Further
than this he was unable tog o, and he
could not gain sight of the body. By
almost superhuman \ efforts he made his
way to % the top alone and at last
reached the village. Staats was al
most prostrated by the physical and
mental strain when he arrived here,
but he wanted to return at once.
YOSEMITE, June 6.â "Word was
brought to. the village late last night
by J. C Staats of y Mount Vernon;
Ohio, that Charles A. Bailey of Oak
land, and a prominent Sierra Club
member, had fallen off a precipice to
his death.

cago on the limited this morning and
brought with him tile' heads of various
divisions of the through road. Every
mile was discussed with the aid of
blueprints and maps. The exact run
ning schedule was not made public, but
Brown said the gain in time would be
made west of Buffalo on the Lake
Shore Railway.
"The eighteen-hour train," he said,
"is something we have long planned
for. The Lake Shore, with three and
four tracks on much of its roadbed,
with small grades 'and a straight run,
is admirably adapted for increasing
speed.
"There are absolutely no difficulties
to meet in making the eighteen-hour
run. We expect the new train to run
close to time and we know the new
speed will be attained with perfect
safety."
NEW YORK, June 6.â The New York

The call for to-morrow's meeting of
the Equitable directors gives notice
that immediately after the adjourn
ment of the regular meeting a special
meeting will be held for the follow
ing purposes: First, of amending the
by-laws, so as to provide lor the office
of chairman of the board of directors
and prescribing the powers and duties
of the office .and passing upon/ such
other amendments to the by-laws as
may be submitted to the meeting: sec
ond. fo# the election of a chairman of
the board to fill the office thus created;
third, for the election of the chairman
us a director of the society.
Among the stories which gained cir
culation to-day was one to the effect
that Henry C. Frick has been offered
a post on the board of directors of the
New York Life Insurance Company,
that many of the directors of that com
pany have asked him to Join the board
and that he is seriously considering the
offer.
It Is understood that Hyde Intends
to resign from the Union Pacific and
Oregon Railroad and Navigation Com
pany boards of directors. These are
Harriman properties.
Thre<r -more, directors resigned to-day
Irom the beard of the Equitable and at
least one mere will retire to-morrow,
::-ak:ng in all ten .resignations since the
l>res.nst troubles of the society began.
The resignation of A. J." Cassatt, presi
de.it of the Pennsylvania Railroad Com-
I^any, was followed this afternoon by the
announcement of the resignations of John
A. Stewart, chairman of the board of di
rectors of the United States Trust Com
pany, and Jchn Sloane. prominent in
banking and trust company circles. The
resignation of D. O. Mills will be handed
to President Alexander 10-murrow. Mills
was at first inclined to "postpone action.
but decided not to attend the meeting.
The other directors who have resigned
from the Equitable board are H. C. Frick,
E. BL Harriman, T. Jefferson Coolidge,
M. E. Ingalls, Jacob H. Schlff and Cor
nelius X. Bliss.
Hyde rave out the following statement
to-day:
"I have been greatly pained by the as
sertion in one of the morning papers that
I had said of the gentlemen who have
seen fit to resign from the Equitable
board that it was freeing ourselves of
driftwood. In the light of existing con
<iltior.s, these untruthful interviews with
me are calculated to do me serious harm.
As to the gentlemen referred to. no one
can question their right to withdraw
from the Equitable board, and while I
greatly regret their point of view did not
coincide with mine, I do not think the
good of the large Interests at stake are
to be served by recrimination."
Alvin TV. Krech. president of the Equit
able Trust Company, was before Super
intendent Hendricks to-day, as also was
H. R. Wlnthrop, financial manager of the
Equitable Society. Winthrop's examina
tion was very brief.
BIG MEETIXG FOR. TO-DAY.
SIOMK-umECTORS RESIGN*.
The price offered was said to be in
the neighborhood of $5,000,000. or about
fl,oo?.Cw more than Hyde was offered for
his control of the Equitable two years
ago, when a syndicate of Wall street
men tried to buy out his interests. Hyde,
It is said, declined Herrick's offer, but
at the sanje time offered to Herrick the
newly created office of the chairmanship
of the board, which the Governor of Ohio
expresses his willingness to accept.
There was a conference at which Hyde
was present with his legal adviser, Sam
ael I'mermyer. There was a full and
free discussion of the selection of a suit
able man for the position of chairman
of the board, ar.d the selection of Gov
ernor Herrick proved acceptable to all
who were in attendance. Herrick is best
known in the business world as a banker,
lie if president of the Society Savings
Bank of Cleveland, an institution of <â¢.
090 depositors, $4.000,(Â«0 in deposits and
$jC.OOO.Â«X) in assets. Herrick began his
business career as a peddler of dinner
bells to farmer*.
It was eaid to-night that Governor
Herrick, as the represenative of a syn
dicate, had made a liberal cash offer for
Hyde's stock holdings, so that if a trans
fer were made, the control of the society
\u25a0would not only be vested in Governor
Herrick as chairman of the board with
plenary powers, but, in fact, he would be
jr. absolute control.
NÂ£TIV YORK. June â¬.â Myron T. Her
riek. Governor of Ohio, probably will be
selected as chairman of the Equitable
Life Assurance Society board. After con
sultation wJth persons representing James
HÂ«zen Hyde, Governor Herrick left the
Waldorf Aetorla at 6 o'clock for his home
In Cleveland. He had assured his visi
tors that he was willing to take hold of
the Equitable at a salary of $150,000 a
year, providing he was given absolute
freefiom in his control of the j society.
end It was added that he was assured
he would be unhampered In his manage
ment.

cur without removing or suspending . the
existing Norwegian legal power. Before
the end of this, week the Storthing: will
have adopted resolutions which from the
instant they come in force will mean
the dethronement of the King.
"The Norwegians maintain that the
King, by not revoking his veto given at
Stockholm of the law for a separate
consular representation and partly by his.
absence from Norway, has suspended
his rights and duties as King of Nor
way. : ' - \
"Under article XIII of toe constitu
tion, the Storthing will Install a respon
sible government which, in the absence
of the King, will govern , in the King's
name. Notification of eventual changes
in constitutional situations will probably
be given to the powers by special mis
sion."
LONDON, June 6.âTbe correspondent
of the Daily News at Christlanla, Nor
way, says that the blue book published
a Government order forbidding the en
trance of Swedish warships to Nor
wegian ports without Government per
mission. According to the Swedish au
thorities in London, . the foregoing order
is not connected with the crisis as to
independent consular representation, but
is the settlement of a long disputed
question as to whether Swedish war
ships should be placed on the same
footing with foreign warships.
The Christiania correspondent of the
Times says he believes be has good "au
thority for saying that Sweden has indi
rectly assured Norway that no forcible
measures will be employed to keep her
within the bonds of the, political union.
The correspondent adds that the Govern
ment will to-day definitely place its resig
nation in the bands of the Storthing.
The Daily Telegraph's correspondent at
Christiania says: "Everything, is ' quiet
here and there is a general desire to flnd
a peaceful solution of the crisis. Consid
erable favor is expressed for an arrange
ment whereby King Oscar shall abdicate
in Javor of a younger member of the royal
house, for Instance the Crown Prince's
son WJlhelm."

the managers c of the-, lighting companleal
to be - reasonable ; In their charges and

â¢The one ereat and constant menace to the
Industry is unwlre. burdensome and restrictive
k-glslatlcn, by th* municipality; and the State.
The right- to tax is the power to destroy. . The
power to regulate contains v the germs of. the
danger of confiscation in,, whole ,or. In.p art.
The regulation of \u25a0< the Industry by a r ; com
mission with.- powers such as are Invested
in . the Gas and Electric Commission, of .the
State ,of Massachusetts 4 may be proper .and
satisfactory as . safeguarding both the rights

pstly intended to* remedy: any admitted public
oppression, or : to -properly regulate the use of

public or to the Investor, arid , must \u25a0 result lin
gross Injustice to the industry. ' *
Another important question Is that of mu

CHICAGO, June 6.-^-Judge S. H. Be
thea in the Federal, court has directed
a- verdict of . guilty against Dr. Alice
B. ; Stockham, 71; years old. and Ed
ward .B. Beckwith. manager of the
Stockham Publishing Company,
charged '. with having circulated im
proper, literature by mail and express.
In deciding. the case Judge Bethea said:
When I the laws were framed It was not be
lieved the general discussion of the marriage
relation . was ' advisable. If these persons be
lieve they are right In teaching these subjects
to that the i young . may learn of them, they
should have , their, doctrines interwoven in the
laws of the â¢ land. What . we have to do Is to
uphold 'the law as It stands.
Among the witnesses for the de
fense was the Rev. .Hiram "W. Thomas.
Dr. Thomas testified that he believed
the woman's : work was uplifting In
stead, of : harmful, even to the young,
and that Mrs. Stockbam- had for years
been doing a work which was to be
commended and not scoffed ' at. .
vltv It was asserted by Dr. Stockham and
her witnesses that she has been in the
publishing: business several years and
never had been questioned by the Gov
ernment In regard to mailing what she
to be medical advice. She de
clared "she received hundreds of letters
from persons who had read her book,

independence and industry Mr. Ebling
has treated her â¢with utmost harsh

1 LONDON, June '6.â Few properties In
this country possess greater Interest â¢ for
literary folk than the Somersby estate, on
which Alfred Tennyson was' born" arid
brought up, and which: has just been of
fered for sale. His father's old rectory,
where the poet first saw. the light. Is still
standing on the estate, almos^every part
of which is associated with- Tennyson's
work.' The rectory itself is a' rambling,
old-world place, and the room ,. in which
Tennyson was born overlooks, the church,
probably "The God's House" of "The Two
Voices," where -his father officiated. The
garden Is full of associations of "In Me-,
moriam," though the trees are not as they
were in Tennyson's time, "the towering
sycamores" and "the poplars' four" hav
ing* disappeared. An old grange, the re
puted residence of "the Northern Farm
er." stands close to the rectory, so close
indeed that the. young Tennyson; by
reaching out of one of the rectory-win
dows, found^himsejf able to steal apple
tarts from' the pantry of the grange's
tenant, a worthy man named Barber.' fr-
Not far from Somersby is "the brook
that swerves to . left , and right thro'
meadowy curves," passing in Its course
three mills, one of which probably sug
gested certain points in the landscape of
"The Miller's Daughter." This stream" is
also Tennyson's famous brook that "went
on forever." On the estate, too, there 'is
a wooded ravine, deep, Wild and shady,
which is called "Holywell Glen." Here
Tennyson wrote "Byron is $cad." The
place is, not improbably, "the dreadful
hollow" which "grinds and clangs its leaf
less iibs and iron horns," and appeals to
readers of "Maud." : Not far distant away
is Mablethorpe, ' possibly the "Lovers'
Bay" mentioned in "The Golden Supper,"
and the seaside resort where Tennyson for
the first time saw "tne , hollow ocean
ridges roaring into. cataracts."
Tennyson was born at Somersby in 1809
and lived there for. the first twenty-eight
years of his life, almost up to the time
when he became* famous. It is felt that
the place should be a national possession.
COXA.\ DOYLE AS A WIT.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is known to be
busy with a new work, although all at
tempts to make him tell anything about it
have proved futile. -The author of "Sher
lock Holmes" has found time,. however, to
attend one or two big . dinners lately,
notably that of the Royal Medical Society
this week, at which he made a ' particu
larly happy speech.
â¢Sir. Arthur responded to the toast ."Lit
erature,"' and said that, he owed that
honor to 'the fact that he was a medical
man. It was -true ! that. y some unkind
critic had remarked -that- in spite -of rthaf
fact ho living'patient of his had ever been
seen. Some authority had lately been
treating the writers of. fiction from a legal
point of view and -examining: their; law.
He came to the conclusion that *â¢ the law
of the novelist was ifeveri ' more strange
and more uncertain, if possible, than the
law with which we were familiar. -One
aphorism at which that authority arrived
was that, if a man died intestate, the
property" went to the nearest \illain. But
if the If w of the novelist was strange, he
thought they would admit that his medi
cine was equally so. ''. They only recog
nized in his branch of' literature certain
diseases, and air those diseases were of
the upper part of the'body. The novelist
never. hit below the belt. They had not a
long list of ailments, and their treatment
was strangely simple.
One disease which* was useful to nov
elists wa| "fits!".. They did not descend
to petty details as to whether it was
an apoplectic or an epileptic fit which
eventually carried .'\u25a0 off the heavy and
stertorous father. - That was a secret
between themselves and their con
sciences. As they were described, they
might sometimes be either or both.
Suffice it that he fell down in a fit,
usually with a pen in his hand and In
front of an unsigned' will. It a
very vague fit. but : it I was 1 opportune
and 1 it was exceedingly effective.
. Dr. Doyle continued that for some
reason gout was always treated by the
romancer as .a .semi-comic disease,
which tended to "prove that the novel
ist, had not himself suffered from ! it.
The gouty and irascible "baronet ; was
one of their most necessary , properties.
He was sure he had every reason to be
irascible if the readers' laughter, was
mvi.ted for his 1 most painful and seri
ous malady. Nobody at . their hands
had ever suffered from.muraps or from
sore throat oi< nettlerash. If they :hit
at all, they hit hard. Then as to . their
doctors: They varied from" the village
practitioner, whose treatment appeared
to be aslap,; on v- the shoulder,; and 'a
merry, twinkle through his glasses, to
that a member of the upper - hierarchy
who came down;, said: nothing, -shook
his head and then, with a Jarge fee in
his pocket, returned again to the upper
regions.

Mrs. Frances Ebling told Police
Judge Mogan that although she. had
seen sanguinary service with the Boer
army in^South Africa, she never, real
ized what wars horrors meant until
she came to San Francisco and entered
into wedlock with Henry Ebling, gro
cer, at Twenty-fifth and Church streets.
She was undaunted by the fact that
Mr. Ebling: had been divorced by no
less than three ladies, who found
his habitual truculence unbearable, be-

/'All right, then, she's bound over,", said

It was ; a backyard quarrel. - Mrs.
O'Brien and Mrs. Welsh met behind their

After the peace disturbance complaint
of Mrs. Jennie O'Brien against Mrs. Annie
Welsh had been heard by Judge Cabaniss
he said he would O. R. the defendant for
thirty days. -
"But I want to have her bound over,"
exclaimed Mrs. O'Brien."
Then it developed that Mr. O'Keefe had
thrice been confined in the Napa Asylum
for Insane, so the Judge ordered that he
be examined by the Lunacy Commission.
John K. O'Keefe, stalwart.wild eyed and
well dressed, was arrested on complaint
of ' Mrs. Mollie Heilman of 708 Brannan

ant, whom she had never seen prior to
that moment, entered her house through
the front- door and after acting in a

about two hours later and nailed an
American flas to the door.
"Why did you do that?" his Honor
asked Mr. O'Keefe. ,'\u25a0'\u25a0 .

youths of,, inferior age said something
which aroused his ire, and he struck

his fair companions, and apparently ut
tered for their hearing, were, "Gee. don't
he think he's it? "Say, kid. where did

Marshal Vollmer has dug up an old
ordinance; on this subject, the provi

nearly, everybody who does business on
the principal streets. This ordinance
makes it a misdemeanor to blockade
the 'pavements with any sort of ob
struction, and a' fine, and imprisonment
may be meted out to any offender. - The
diligent' Marshal \u25a0 says he will see to it
that the law is strictly enforced.
\u25a0 "We're no- longer a village -commu
nity, if we ever were one," said Marshal
Vollmer to-day. "If the law has been
disregarded mnd its violations winked
at, it's time l f or : a change. 1 ... hope the
merchants won't fancy that we propose
to persecute them or make it inconven
ient for them to do business, but the
law is a good one, citizens generally
will be glad to see it enforced and so
the rule will be made that all violators
must be punished."

Judge of the Recorder's; Court in and for the
City of San Leandro, Cal.:
Dated this 6th day of June. 1905.
'As to the returns, by said officer on the exe
cutions. I asked said officer to make a proper
amended return of the executions by stating
what property of the defendant was sold,
when, where,' how sold, to whom, how much
was received in gold coin. Not being - fa
miliar with formulating euch a return he're
quested me to write, it for him on the 25th
day of August, 1904. He dated it and signed
it. and I flifdlt for record on 'the same date,
since which date I never saw It again until
I had It shown to me In court. "That < is the
paper I am charged with having substituted.
Those not knowing the circumstances of
these cases, reading the dally papers where
these reports have appeared . from time to
time, will naturally infer that where there
"Is so much smoke there must be some flre.
' I have done no wrong. \my conscience Is clear
of any â¢ wrong intent, although ' some years
ago this same enemy Instigated and prose
cuted me by ' having tme ' arrested upon \u25a0 a
charge of battery,' said to have . been /by me
committed upon a man. and of ' whicn I was
entirely Innocent. For this ' spite \u25a0 Work ', the
county was . made to pay a large sum of
money In fees , to Constable Gallet i for . mib
penas for twenty-four persons summoned to
break down' my testimony. -Few, however,
paid any attention and took the chance of
being, fined for contempt of court In not obey
ing the subpena. .The constable got his fees.
: PURGED BY JURY.
The. bill of.Â«ale for the wagona and chains
sold by the constable' to Schmidt, under three
executions iscufd out of my court, was a pri
vate paper between the officer and Schmidt
and never formed any part of the record in
any court or any exhibit In any proceeding
hence the officer could change it by Inserting
"and chains/ which had been omitted, to
make it conform to facts and epeak the truth.
THE EXPLANATIOX.
John Blfiok. the aged Judge of the lie- ;
oorder's Court in San Leandro. comes
forward with a statement denying that i
he has in any way' subverted /justice.
The Judge was accused by a man named
liar/son, with whom he has hod'along
standlnnr feud, with having changed or
substituted, a public record. The last
turn, of events in the quarrel . Ima j
brought forth an original and' unique
statement from Judge Black. It is as
follows:
Now comee John Black and emphatically de- :
nles each and every allegation In the charge*:
made against him by said Rawson, that he al- ,
tered, changed- or substituted In .his r court or:
elsewhere, a public record, and asserts that ;
the charge Is false and . malicious, concocted ;
In a mean, contemptible brain. I am greatly;
surprised that -a.. Judge of the Superior Court
of Alamoda County should be bo far influ
enced by an ex parte statement from any man,
and. to give it sufficient consideration, to tell
me In hls court, "you ought to be glad of an
opportunity to explain a charge which If true
will land you in State's' prison," and that
charge ' uot In writing or under oath. v r I The |
Judge's remark was uncalled for and unjust
at lenst:- . Probably It was actuated 'by Raw
son'* plug hat or pretty mustache. There Ms j
nothing suspicious about my whole connec-'.

husband that wore silk underclothes
being her ideal.

Between each number of ..-e pro
gramme the orchestra played appro
priate selections. The diplomas were
awarded by James A- Ballentine, dean
of the Evening Law School, in a short
speech. They were accepted on behalf
of the graduating class by Charles
Peyton Pritchard. On accepting his
diploma each graduate was presented
with a large bouquet of flowers. The
committee of arrangements comprised:
Charles P. Pritchard, '05: Havelock
Fourness. '06; Charles E. Thomas, '07;
and Lile T. Jacks, 'OS.
The four graduating this year are:
Charles Baer. James M. Griffin, Charles
Peyton Pritchard and Henry Schmidt.
Already one of the graduates has been
at work for some time in a local law
office. Schmidt found it impossible to
be present last night, and his diploma
will be given at a later day.
The exercises were simple and im
pressive. The programme opened with
a short invocation for the welfare of
the students and the graduates. Fol
lowing this came an interesting ad
dress by Judge Frank J. Murasky. His
remarks concerned the career of a law
student land an attorney. He told of
the mission of the lawyer, the duties
and obligations he would enter upon,
and closed with a plea that they would
hi all times resist the many tempta
tions that arise in the course. of a law
jer's career.
Last night the evening department
of the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion celebrated a unio.ue event in its
history by the graduation of four law
students who have completed the four
years' course. Four years ago the law
course was instituted, and the four
graduates last night are the first of
the long list that will come in after
years. Members of the undergraduate
classes and their friends attended the
exercises and the auditorium was
crowded.

wholly selfish passion holds within it tha
seeds of its own destruction. Whereas,
an unselfish affection,* based on pure mo
tives and high â¢ impulses, and the desire
to share .with its object the burdens as
well as the joya of existence, Is Its own
assurance of perpetuation.
At this stage of humanity's progress it
is perhaps Impossible to find any love that
has no element of selfishness in It. Yet
I do not at all agree with the pessimists
who would have us believe that men and
women to-day are Incapable of unselfish
devotion; that marriage is -a failure and
love Itself unattainable. . â¢
On the contrary, I think, all conditions
considered, we see abundant evidence of
the most "sublime affection in /our midst
every day and every hour. All about us
men and. women are sacrificing them
selves and conquering self for love's sake.
Love proves itself In worksâ ln deeds.
And it is my opinion that the highest,
most unselfish sort of love known at pres
ent Is represented in tha devotion of the
typical American husband to his wife and
family and - the loyalty of the Americas
wife in helping her husband fight his
battles.

Those who have any real knowledge of

that; it demands the highest standard of

that the spiritual healing of this science
has nothing | in common with hypnotism

tion, that . there is . "a conspiracy in the
formation of clubs throughout the land,"

Scientists do not organize clubs and any

REPLIES TO ATTACK ON
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE.
UNREST IN NORWAY.
SAN FRANCISCO AND PHILADELPHIA.
JHIÂ£ Quaker City is theikst to join San Francisco in a deter
mined effort to purify municipal government. The manage
ment of public utilities in Philadelphia 'has been scandalous
from the very beginning of municipal ownership. The water sup
ply has furnished rich fishing for officials, and when the city was
; almost turned into a pesthouse by the bad quality of the Water the
eftprt to make it better was taken advantage of by official, thieves,
who plucked the taxpayers of millions.
The city gas works had the same history. The gas was costly ami
poor in quality, and every extension and betterment was made the
v means of official graft. Finally the gas works were turned over to
a private corporation under a contract exceedingly favorable to th&*
* city, and there was immediate improvement in the lighting and a
lowering of its cost. The people approved this and thought that the
gas graft was ended. But the motto of the grafter is, "When you
get a good thing keep it," and it did not take long for the dishon
orable fraternity of municipal thieves to lure the private gas.com
pany into a scheme for an enormously profitable and wholly un
justifiable extension of its privileges. This was vetoed by Mayor
Weaver, but was immediately passed over his head.
Then the citizens of Philadelphia surprised the whole country
by rising in anger against their robber masters, the grdfte.rs. It was
supposed that they had lost the "spirit of protest. But it is the
unexpected that happens and Philadelphia did the unexpected by
! falling in behind the Mayor, who used his power to remove two
. members of a city board who controlled thousands of appointments
to office. He was attacked in the courts, but was sustained, and
now the negative movement of mere' protest has been transformed
into a positive movement for purgation of the city government and
the daughters of the horse leech go about the streets like sleep
walkers, unable to' believe their senses.
This movement is junior to San Francisco's impulse in the,
same direction. Ours began with the arrest of the ballot-box stuf
fcrs after last year's primary. That arrest at first caused amuse
ment among the grafters.' They had made use of all the art and
craft they knew to conceal their crimes and so made merry, in fan
cied security. They make merry no more. Three of them have
been convicted and a majority of them are chewing the cud of bitter
\u0084 reflection' in. the penitentiary, as all soon will be. The small but
* energetic movement to protect the ballot-box soon developed into
organization for municipal reform and took shape in the Republican
League. San Francisco now occupies the center of the stage, with
Philadelphia, waiting in the wings, ready to take her cue. The at
tention of the whole country is upon these two cities and the fight
for their reformation is before a great cloud of witnesses.
. We do not pass upon the issues involved in a case now on trial,
for that would be highly improper; but it is perfectly proper to note
that one of the attorneys for the defense seems to think that the
Republican League and the Merchants' Association have been
guilty of some, pernicious offense and that they are on trial, in
stead of his client. He voices the sentiment of the system. Its
supporters are men of perverted conscience who really believe that
every organization that opposes graft is a bad body composed of bad
men, and tiiat to speak to Fairfax Wheelan disqualifies a man for
citizenship and its duties. It is seldom that an attorney gets s,o
full "of the spirit of the side he is defending, and not many lawyers
could have so deeply written the praise of those for whom offense >
was intended. *"\u25a0-... . - . \u25a0 -"--/; -
His classification of the community is unconsciously correct.'.
The forces of reform . are instinctively selected as the enemies of
the cause which he represents, and they gladly accept the designa
tion. The attempt to discredit them is merely a call to greater de-.
votion and higher duty. The whole government of the city, in all of
its branches, from the executive to the judicial, is under keen obser
vation. Every place that needs purgation is being marked. The
faithful need have no fear. The unfaithful, no matter where they
sit, may' be sure that they are not forgotten. If courts lend them
selves to outlawing men because they publicly declare for 'good
government, those courts will go down with the system they are
trying to serve. There will be no retreat. Already this movement,
has practically absorbed the majority of one political party and has
the sympathy and support of a powerful minority in the other party.<
If the wisdom that brought it forth shall not fail, it will sweep the
city next November and offer a high example to the whole country.
NORWEGIAN statesmen are supposed to understand their
business and to know what is best for their country, but to
a far outsider it appears that dissolution of the union of 1814
would be a political mistake. The country has only 2,000,000 of
people and an area of 124,000 square miles, or 31,000 square miles
less than California. It has its separate constitution and legislature
and shares a constitutional King with Sweden, the two making a
stale of 6.960,860 people, with an area of 297,415 square miles. â¢
Though the Swedes and Norwegians are of common Scandi
navian blood, and are geographically separated by an artificial
boundary only, their national ambitions are distinct. The com
bined state and people exhibit many remarkable traits. While the
population is small it is strong and fecund. It has for two centuries
made a most acceptable and a very large contribution to ounpopifc
lation. The Scandinavians have the. instinct of self-government
strongly developed, and wherever they have settled in the United
States they have proved devoted to our constitution, supporters
of our schools and the friends of law, order and civil and religious
liberty.- There are probably now scattered over the world, but prin
cipally located in the United States, three times as many people of
Scandinavian blood as .make up the population of the two states.
No lover of liberty desires to see strife between Sweden and
Norway. The trouble" has apparently originated in rival commer
cial ambitions. Norway has demanded separate consuls to""repre
sent and push her trade in other couritries. This demand is proba
bly caused by a feeling that Swedish consuls push the trade of
Sweden and neglect that oj Norway. After the Storthing of Nor
way had enacted a system of separate consuls, the, King. vetoed; the
measure, and how.'there is danger of a war of secession that will
be fought with all the persistence of a people slow to anger.
We hare in public life in this country a large number of first
class Norwegians and Swedes. They arc Judges on the bench, Gov
ernors of States and members of both branches of Congress. It
would be well if their influence could be brought \u25a0 to bear upon their
mother country to the end that, war arid the injury of a splendid face
may. be averted. ;, ' ' .' \u25a0 ' . ,

I\/l RS. SMITH came, into thÂ« notice
I of r the great reading, publio of ;tbe
. ' Windy City on the occasion of, the
slip-lit mistake in identity she made by
confusing its nevy. commissioner, of pub
lic "works., with- one of '"thim rplagruey
reporters," as she terms the 'members
of the craft. Mrs.
Smith's frank com
ments on the press
and the condition
of the board of
public, works, par
ticularly the' jani
tor service iv/ the
City Hall, during
the strike of her
f c 1 low - workers,
were hailed | with
the joy, of the dis
covery of a, new
philosopher. But
-those who havo
known Mrs. Smith
long cherish a re
gret that she has
been discovered
and hope with no
little fear that' she
will no Â£ be spoiled
in any way by the
publicity she has
attained. For Mrs.
Smith has that
treasure I of ,' treas
ures, absolute hon
esty of speech and
purpose.
That the hope
has good grounds,
however, , is evi
denced b y Mrs.
Smith's.naive com
ment on her own
experience.
"Sure, I met Mr.
Patterson. He was
just a good lookin'
boy, artd how was I
to know? Anyhow,
even if I had
known who he
was* I'd have said
just' th c sam c
, things to him be
cause they are all
true, worse luck?"
One is somehow
reminded of there
ply o f * Marcus '
Daly, the copper king, to the lady who
said to him, effusively:" "Mr. Daly, I
would rather meet you than the Prince
of Wales." To which Daly said, gruffly
and decisively: "Madam, lam a dâ n
sight better man."
Mrs. Smith -lives over on the West
side, "where all the good people live,"
she will tell jj r ou. Furthermore, she re
sides'in the Nineteenth Ward and is
the stanchest henchman of "Johnnie"
Powers. There is no doubt that
Mrs. Smith controls a larger primary
vote than many a man who shines as
a star at the ward meetings. Being a
woman, she is a born politician; be
ing Irish,, she is a fighter in her poli
tics; and being a resident of the Nine
teenth, she wins.
, She has a title, has Mrs. Smith, and
that unknown to her. She is the "Phil
anthropist." How she won it is one of
those stories that make life the bright
er for the reading. â¢
She comes on duty at the city hall' at
5 o'clock In the evening. At a little
after 6 she takes her basket and goes
down the street to join the "bread- i

During the Spanish- American -War
Colonel Montgomery handled all the im
portant messages emanating at the
White House and received there rela
tive to the International difficulties. He
knew many hours before the outside
world when the war would be declared
and also had knowledge of the plans of
the fighting on land and sea long before
the world had even attempted a con^c
ture. At the White House the colonel
Is regarded as one of the most trust
worthy employes of the Government
and enjoys the highest respect of the
President and members of the Cabinet
and also the members of the foreign
plomatic corps. He has also been an
important factor in the ceremonies at
tending thÂ« formal 'openings of the big
r-xpositfens held in various parts of this
country for many years, for it has been
through him that the Presidents have
Colonel B. F. Montgomery, who hold.
one of the most responsible positions
in the army and who probably knows
more of the secrets of the present and
past administrations at Washington j
than any other military officer, has been
in this city for several days and Is stay
lac at the Occidental Hotel. He is the
cnief of the telegraph and cipher bureau
of the executive office of the White
House, and it is through his department
that all important messages of apri
vate and official character, sent and re
ceived by the President and the mem
bers cf the Cabinet, pass.
Colonel Montgomery originally was a
newspaper man. but for nearly a Quar
ter of a century he has been in the mili
tary department at Washington and the
greater part of that time he has been
connected with the telegraph and ci- ;
pber bureau. Silence is his greatest at
tribute. Although of a genial nature
iir.d an Interesting conversationalist, j
tiie colonel refrains from discussing
;iny subject pertaining to Government
i.fT^lrs, thus Insuring himself against
i;.e possibility of Inadvertently letting
blip the slightest hint that -might be,
used in building up a theory as to what
Washington officialdom is doing. He
fticks rigidly to this rule at all times,

The report the' teachers of the
Washington Grammar School would be
placed upon . the- unassigrned list and
that pupils would be sent to the-Nor
mal,Training. School pending the.erec
tion of the new building is pronounced
absolutely without foundation. SchoÂ«l
Director, Roncovieri says that arrange
ments are being, made far in advance
to take care of both teachers and. pu
pils. The report probably started from
the.fact that the old Le Conte School
and the present Normal School build
ing, both the property of the city, will
be pressed into service as substitutes
for the Washington /. Grammar, j The
two- former buildings are now being
used by the State Normal School, but
the trustees have been notified to -va
cate the premises by the Board -of Ed
ucation and this will be done when the
new Normal School building ; is com
pleted. By that time operations on the
Washington Grammar will .be , com
menced. The board will also utilize
portable schools and provide such ac
commodations â¢ that ; the attendance -at

William Kirkpatrick, son of Colonel

for Chicago, where he contemplates re
maining several weeks before returning
to Harvard University, from which he
will graduate next year.'

PERSONAL.
F. Alba de Costa, a mining man of
Goldfleld, is at the Palace.
George H. Hutton, a well-known .resi
dent of Santa Monica, is staying- at the
Palace.
W. W. Chapin, manager of the Sacra
mento Pipe Works, is registered at
the Palace. \u25a0 . .
George A. Schroter, a mining expert
for the Venture Corporation of London,
is at the St. Francis.
A- del Toro, who is at the -lead of
rcveial enterprises in Mexico, and his
wife, ars staying at the St. Francis.
Among yesterday's arrivals at the
Palace were Jackson B. Reynolds, a
prominent railroad attorney of New
York, and his wife. 4
And should any good San Franciscan
feel inclined to assist In the matter of
providing for the caretaker at the old
Mission, his contribution would be much
appreciated and duly acknowledged.
And thus would he prove his patriotism
to be of that highest and rarest typeâ
the patriotism that touches the pocket.
And then will San Francisco' have
partly atoned for her apathy toward a
noble heirloom In whose incensed corri
dors Bhe was nurtured.
children and church meet face to face. . '
Then there are the students of history,
the writers of romance, the dreamy poet,
all interested in this monument to a lost
people. . . . ii-
And there are the school children of
Sun Francisco, who at last are acquiring
some knowledge of the history of the
big virile West. They may ha<e the op
portunity of wandering through the old
adobe church, of peering into the queer
old attic, noting the great beams tied
together 'with rawhide, the bellsâ gifts
from the Kings of Spainâ hanging from
huge oaken yokes, thong-fastened; of
studying the grotesque paintings upon the
east wall, done in segments by different
and, indifferent artists of Mexico;* of view
ing the queer decorations of the ceiling,
done in the "lightning" designs by the
Indian children of Francisco Palou. All
these, and a thousand other things, will
appeal to these little Sau Franciscans,
who will thus imbibe a practical lesson in
patriotism, and a few lessons in charac
ter-study not set down in the approved
"course of study."
Now, that these things all may be, van
dalism must be stamped out now and for
ever. It is one of the blots on the Yan
kee 'scutcheon, and by a general con
demnation of the thieving relic-hunter,
the honor of our people may be redeemed.
But pending the arrival of the public to
that ethical .stateâ where temptation to
amputate a toe from St. Francis, or to
"lift" a crown from St. Anne, will be' no
moreâ a caretaker will be put in charge
of Mission Dolores, who not only will
watch you â and you mustn't be offended
thereatâ but will tell you something of
the history of the place, and something,
of Its traditions.
Old Mission Dolores, long closed to vis
itors because of the sins of the Ã¼biqui
tous relic-hunter, will soon open its doors
to such as enter with a spirit of right
eousness.
It will open its doorÂ«, too. at an. early
<Lnl* â so soon as the venerable pastor,
llev. Father Brennan. and Congressman
Know'aiid. president of the Landmarks
i .league, can select a suitable caretaker,
Erien&s of the league promising to raise
the necessary funds. This much was -de
cided yesterday during a conference be
tween the Congressman from-over-the
hay and the Rev. Father Brennan, and
great was the Joy thereat of those wlio
love the old Mission and the memories
that cluster round it.
As at all other Missions, the vandal
plied his villainies at Mission San Fran
cisco de Assist (Dolores), until the pas
tor, in sheer defense of the properties
entrusted to him, was forced to close
the doors and to keep them closed. That
was many years ago. and since that time
the old sanctuary could be vested only
on Sunday mornings (when the little
children of the parish gather for Sunday
school* and on Holy Thursdays, when the
Holy Eucharist is exposed upon the altar.
But during that time thousands of
tourists have come to our city, most of
whom had vt?ited the Missions In the
chain established by theÂ« padres in long
ag<Â». and who desirpd to see St. Francis
tie Asstei. whos* birth was coincident
with the birth of America. But it was
closed, and closed tightâ the good tour
ists were paying for the sins of the bad
Then there are the thousands of San
Franciscans who worshiped, in the old
church as children; who grew up in *t>
shadow, and who plighted their loves at
its .iltar; to these, every spot in the 010
sanctuary is sacredâ some sweet memory
clinging to -it. like the perfume , of CI-j
Oastilian roses that grow without In the
churchyard.
To these will the news be welcomed.
\nd when the final details shall have
been arranged these grown-up children
of the Mission will come to pay their
tributÂ«uof love, leading their children by
the baWd; repeating to them the story of
the Ml&ion, its romance, its tragedy,
and. perhaps, its little <Â»*Â«*Â«*â¢
comwJv there was. and always -Is. when

DUNPHY WILL
A VALID TRUST
Supreme Court Decides That
Mrs Cannot Break Codi
cHtto Receive Lump Sum
DECISION IS UNIQUE
Comparison Made With Fair
; Testament in ; Which^ Pro
posed Trust Was Invalid
Mary -D.". Flood, daughter of the late
\u25a0.William'^Dunphy.rwho left over a million
dollars in, trust for his five heirs, lost her
last gj chance jto break the will .ot her
father,, by a decision of the Supreme
Court^esterday. :The ruling', upholds the
decisions of the, Superior Court and,, cre
ates a new departure in the legal history
*of codicils, in that It establishes . the
first "trust" in California. Throughout
the opinion of \u25a0 the court, comparison Is
made with the rulings in the Fair es
tate, where an attempt to create a trust
was declared : invalid. ,
When ,i William Dunphy died he left
property in Monterey and Nevada to the
value of over $1,500,000. This property .he
.willed should be j converted Into cash for
the purpose of . investment, appointing
his wife and one daughter, Jennie .C*
Dunphy,/ executrices.. After the, pay
ment of expenses and taxes, the will de
creed that the net sum remaining should
be ; declared a : trust and apportioned
equally among his five heirs. These heirs
are Carmen O.' Dunphy, his wife; Jennie
C. Dunphy, and Mary .D. , Flood, his
daughters; ' James C. Dunphy, his son,
and a minor, Viola Piercy, a child of a
deceased daughter. Jennie C. 'Dunphy
was declared guardian of the child.
Throughout - the will there were pro
visions ; attached to each bequest so that
In case any of â¢ the : five - heirs should die
his one-fifth share should go to his heirs
or revert to the trust. Each heir would
be paid > an annual* Income from a one
fifth share every quarter. To such a
provision Mary D. Flood objected. She
endeavored :to break the ' will by hav
ing the trust declared Invalid. The ob
ject of this was to obtain possession of
her fifth share at once so that she
could become , possessor of the money
without waiting for quarterly payments
and for the/privllege of" bestowing it at
her death as she ; might see fit. â¢
Judgment " was against ; her In the Su
perior Court, where a hard fought legal
battle' took place between the- attorneys
for the : plaintiff. Myrick & Deering, and
Lloyd & Wood, Charles Wheeler and
others for the defendants, Jennie C. Dun
phy et aL Appeal was taken to the Su
preme Court and the lower court was
sustained. ." r
.; Throughout 1 the opinion constant com
parison Is made with the Fair will,. In
\u25a0which James G. Fair left his money to
his heirs but bound , them, to leave their
shares In turn to ; certain people. It i-lso
made no provision for a change in trust
â¢without a change In trusteeship. On
these grounds the codicil was broken.
' The^ Supreme Court lield In the Dunphy
will S that a real trust Is created, the
principal difference between It and the
Fair willlyin^Jn the fact that the heirs
are left ; the s money direct, receiving one
fifth each of the net Income. They
are given "power 'to dispose of It as they
see fit at the time of their death by will.
The will leaves many j bequests to char-:
liable institutions,' which do not affect
the status of the trust/ v^: ? ;V

BUDAPEST. Hungary, June: 6. â At a
meeting' of ..the Emigration Committee
of Parliament to-day. Premier Ti3za de
clared it was calumlnous to assert that
,the ' Government connived at official
agents decoying emigrants so as to sup- .
ply, shipping companies with a certain
number of steerage passengers and said
it was not .true that, secret agents were
the cause of the large exodus.
; The' German lines,* the Premier, added,
maintained : 500 of these agents, who
were : principally responsible for the
emigration of 61,000 persons 1 .without
passports in : 1904,' during " ; the * flght.be
tweenthe Germanlines and the Cunard
line: -The activity of these agents, bow
ever, - had s been" partially [ frustrated by
the recent agreement between the Cu
nard Company, and the" German lines, by
which -a percentage of the emigrant 3;
can be shipped openly by way of Ger
.man ports." ". *

A club named the Presidio Golf Club
has been formed for the purpose of main
taining the golf course on the United
States military reservation at the Pre
sidio. The San Francisco Golf and Coun
try Club on of about the first of August
will give up the Presidio golf course and
take up its new quarters at Ingleslde near
Lake Merced. The military authorities
ia charge of the Presidio reservation have
consented to grant to the new club thÂ»
privileges enjoyed heretofore Dy the San
Francisco Golf Club.
The clubhouse to the west of First
avenue and Just outside the wall of thÂ«
reservation has been sold by ths Saa
Francisco Golf and Country Club and ar
rangements have been made with the pur
chasers to lease, it on moderate terms.
The owners will put the building Into
thorough repair and the surrounding
grounds into goad order.
.The membership of the new club win In
clude regular members, a ladles' annex
and a Junior annex. The regular members
are men and pay $3 per month. ThÂ«
members of the ladies' annex, must bÂ«
over the age of 21 years and pay $L5O per
month. The youner people between th*
ages of 15 and 21 years of a regular mem
ber's household may be elected to the
Junior annex, their dues being $1

of all classes must be elected by thÂ«
board of directors. Members of the.la
dies' and the junior annexes will have the
use of the golf course and clubhouse' un
der such restrictions as may be Imposed
by the directors. An admission fee of $25
will be paid by regular members only, tha

..NEW YORK. June ;^6.â Richard Cheat

ern'Ootton Growers' Association, who is.
in this city, has declared j his" intention of
calling j President Roosevelt's attention to
what jhe considers gross irregularities in
both the preparation and the publication
of the Government cotton report, issued
last : Friday. Cheatham will make * ''\u25a0 no
charges ; of, bribery , "or - any ; other :; crime,
but ; his ; intention Is :to ask \ for a rigid
investigation and that the resignation of
one of/ the / important 'employes ;in the
statistical bureau of ' the Department ; of |
Agriculture, be demanded. It \u25a0i 3 under
stood that he charges some 'one in the

cotton and to protect the planters and
other Southern r cotton interests from
manipulation of the market. ; Officers of
the '\ association declare they have as
many experts as; the Department oÂ£ Ag-;

the*, most 'trustworthy information \u25a0\u25a0 re

several months the g statistics gathered

chants in this city, have conducted a se

Cabinet meeting - Secretary Wilson's at
tention was called to the* charges or the
Southern Cotton Association that there
had been a Vleak',* . in the Information
gathered by the Agricultural Department
concerninr the cotton crop. He charac
terized the charges as ridiculous. It was
possible,- he said, that : somebody, con
nected with the department had been
pretending to have knowledge of the cot
ton figures , of the department, but as a
matter of facUt^was J'ra^Ucally^lmpossl

VALLEJO, June 6.â The feeling of hos
tility that has been growing stronger
against Admiral McCalla, commandant of
the Mare Island navy - : yard, and , Con
structor. Holden Evans since the arrival
of i Constructor Evans from Norfolk last
December ' has broken out ' in an agita
tion led by the Vallejo Trades and Labor
Council - and ' taken up by one- of the
mornlrig papers (the Times). The Labor
Council . has asked Admiral McCalla to
appear before it and discuss with fRe
labor leaders the many charges of
tyranny.: that are made 'against him at
the* meeting of the council.
The Times, in publishing a series of ar
ticles reflecting upon the admiral's con
duct of affairs, has so aroused the com
mandant* that -he has done something
very unusual in naval historyâ written a
long letter in reply.
.McCalla's strict interpretation of the
naval regulations and Constructor Evans*
action in disrating many workmen have
aroused a bitter feeling of discontent
among the 1900 employes of the yard. Val
lejo's Interests are deeply mixed up in
the conduct of the yard, and interest f n
the present controversy is at a high
pitch. '
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The Mongolia will carry about 150. cabin
passengers. Commissioner cf Immigra
tion Sargent will travel on the liner as far
as Honolulu. Of treasure the Monoglia
trill take about $500,000.
In spite of the defeat of the Russian
fleet the Mongolia's officers will keep a
sharp lookout for vessels flying the Rus
sian flag. Rumors of activity of the Rus
sian volunteer fleet have reached the Pa
cific Mall Company and tbÂ«re will be
more cr less anxiety until the liner has
landed in Japan every pound of her con-,
traband.
The Pacific Mall Company's big liner
Mongolia, Captain Porter, will sail at 1
o'clock this afternoon for the Far East.
Her cargo of 15,000 tons consists largely of
war supplies for Japan, disguised on the
shipping papers as machinery. Since
Togo's historic victory, Russian interfer
ence with commerce is no longer a serious
menace and the veil of secrecy which
hitherto has largely concealed the nature
cf much of the freight shipped to Japan
from this port. In a measure has been
lifted. In the Mongolia's cargo axe many
cases of unloaded shells and other muni
tions of war.

Xevr York Stock List.
R. F. Hutton & Co., 490 California street.
San Francisco, members of the New York
Â£tock Exchange, furnish the follow ins official
quotations of that Exchange: .
NEW YORK, June 6. â There waa no more
news to account for to-days decline In stocks
than there was to account for yesterday's
advance. The volume of dealings declined to
a still smaller total' anl midsummer dullness
prevailed. One of the effects of the stock
transfer tax is to induce room trader* to
operate for wider fluctuations than before, to
that the changes of an eighth between sales
are lees frequent than formerly. Incentive to
Induce a movement of prices Is correspond
ingly greater. With the market strictly In
professional hands, the movement of one day
is designed to secure a point of vantage tor
a contrary movement the following day. The
present market reports little else than this
maneuvering among professional traders to
move prices and to afford opportunity for their
efforts to secure an advantage at each other's
expense. Such news as there was to-day- was
not unfavorable to values and thero were come
Items of advantage. The weekly crop rjeport
of the weather bureau .was regarded as dis
tinctly encouraging. A dominant influence
in the market was the decided weakness of
Amalgamated Copper. . Many. Intimations were
afloat in speculative circles before the mar
ket opened that a sharp upward movement In
this sto.k was intended, based en the financial
statement of the company published yesterday.
Suspicions were entertained that a process of
unloading was going on on the part of a
recently active pool In the stock. The effect
was disquieting on pool operators In other
rtocks, and the weakening- effect spread by
sympathy. The Equitable Life incident took
en trine revived Influence for depressing;, owing
to the successive retirements announced from
the directorate of the society by persons of
Influence In the financial world. Security
markets were affected by the rumors of the
assassination of the Czar. Whatever effect
was produced here was purely sentimental, as
the operations In this market for London ac
count were not sufficient to pay for the ex
penses fÂ»f cabling. There was some dispo
sition to look 'to the money market as the
place for the eeat of the depression in stocks.
notwithstanding the irreat apparent ease of
money, i The surphie reserve disclosed by
Saturday's bank statement waa at a low level,
and large special transactions continue to make
requirements on the market. The market closed
weak at the lowest of the day. â¢\u25a0 â¢â¢
Bonds were dull and irregular. \u25a0 Tctal sales,
par value, $2.655,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call.

The market for fresh fruits - was active,
weather conditions being favorable to trado
and choice offerings of all deciduous kinds
found prompt sale at full figures, but poor
stock, which, was still in free supply, continued
to Crag and prices for such were more or lesa
Irregular. Fine ripe Apricots In small boxes
and crates were scarce and higher.' but there
was plenty of rcaly and otherwise poor fruit
available at the' inside quotations. Well-col
ored Peaches. Apples and Plums were also in
good request at firm rates, but there was prac
tically no market for culle and windfalls,
which formed a large percentage of the avail
able supplies. The demand â¢ for Cherries was
rather limited, but prices were well maintained,
receipts being light. The canners bought con
siderable quantities of the. common and red
and white varieties, but refused to pay "the
prices asked for other kinds. . Berries arrived
frevly and ruled weak," particularly for crated
goods and ordinary Blackberries. Raspberries
sold at a wide range as to quality. \u25a0 those from
Santa Rosa and vicinity being mostly poor and
dull at $5^6 per chest. \u25a0 Cantaloupes In small
crate* from the Coachella Valley were In 5 good
request at .$2 50 per crate, and Watermelons
from the same Source, the first of the season
from that quarter, were offering at \u25a0To per

1904-5 Rio and Santos crop would be about
11.000.000 baxÃ. It actually tarns out below
20.000,000 bags. This year the trade expects
that the 1305-6 Rio and Santos crop will be
about 11.000.000 beÂ«s. The similarity of
oplrioss to those of a year ago are striking;
but ixbofiy really knows â to fact, nobody can
know â within a million bags what the crop
-.<\u25a0-.:: be uctil reliable reports are received from
the different sections as to what the average
outturn in weight cf beane will be per given
measure of cherries. A fully developed bean
is generally expected. In cur opinion suffi
cient allowance is not made for the extra
ordinarily heavy and continued rainfall of
lste. which nxust have washed a considerable
quantity of Ti\>Â« cherries from the trees. On
those plantations where the ground has not
t** r. cleared, which w* helieve to be the case
oa moat: pLastatione. the weeds szust have
CTown very hlfh and the quantity which has
cropped off must be counted as a total loss.

er&ngns asd lemons are in excellent condition.
Grapes give Indications of a large yield.
EtBEKA SUMMARY. â Weather cool. Con
dition of crop* excellent, but made slow
growth. Borne early oats cut and new hay
will be on the market In a few days. Rain
needed in the interior.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARY.â Continued
cool and cloudy weather Is not conducive to
good growth. Haying Is about finished in
tome places and baling has begun. Deciduous
fruit crop reports are not favorable except ap
ricots. Some beans required replanting.

The Grand Jury indicted Salvatori Stra
mo and Angelo Napoli yesterday for the
murder of Joseph Brogardo last January.
Stramo and Napoli were arrested on the
strength of a confession by Anclo Brlasue.
who alone had been accused of the crime.
During the investigation positive proof
was shown that a Mafia or association or
ganized to do murder has existed in thl3
city. â¢
When the news that Brlssile was about
to teU all he knew was spread abroad
grim warnings were conveyed to his. cell
at'the County Jail. One card which was
sent to him read. "Be silent or we will
kill you." This threat is believed to
have been sent by Napoli. who, it
is alleged, planned the killing of Bro
gardo. "A bench warrant was Issued
immediately after the " indictments were
found and Stramo and Napoli were
given into the custody of the Sheriff. De
tective Tom Gibson and, Policemen Evatt
and Esola, who have been working on the
case, are certain that this action of the
Grand Jury will* practically break up the
gang. --'\u25a0...." . ' â¢'

on which Collins hopes to quash the in

the offense of cohabitation Js not a fel

O'Donnell: was. elected collecting clerk
of the local encampment of Woodmen
two years ao.' His accounts were kept In
a ; perfectly straight * condition as far ; as
the members . of the . organization knew.
It was his duty to collect^the dues of the
membars and to pay the 'money into tne
hands of the banker, T. F. Quinlan. As
near as Mr. Quinlan . can remember, . it
was last ' July that â¢ the accounts of the
clerk began to fall behind. At the end of
each month the banker receives the bene
fit * fund from the clerk, and sends . the
money. to the general treasury at Denver.
This money was paid four or five days
late by O'Donnell, and when questioned
about it he said that the members were
delinquent. His, .word was taken, and no
investigation was 'made, although a new
clerk was elected InDecember of 1904.
When the new clerk, John Wisnom,
took office the membership books , were
looked over, 1 not : because of any suspi
cion, 'but as a matter of; precaution. In
them - was found . a discrepancy between
the individual accounts of , the members
and .;.'the amount turned , over to tho
banker. '.jftL* â¢
COMMITTEE JBtTKESTIGATES.
A committee, consllFfflnV of M. T. Mose3,
T. F. Quinlan, E. J 1.~1 Jaacs,' John Wisnom
and David j Oliver "â¢ Jr/ * was . appointed to
go over the personal Vocounts of the 1810
members ;of .theHr^ternity,*;and to their
surprise they/ f oundf I that Â£ there '-.- was - a
shortage; of "over $50CJ\ln thelpayments of
'O'Donnell to Qulnl%/ By the time the
books had been' thoroughly., gone over the
calendar v ;had reached' the middle of May,
and a report \ was t handed ' in ; to . the gen
eral body of itheYW'oodmea. v In the mean
time Quinlan iO'Dohnell and
asked him for ; .the:-" money. O'Donnell
said : VI have spent it/0 Quinlan." That
was his only explanation.
i Following the announcement of. the de
falcation ~of the clerk an attempt was
made by friends of the unfortunate man
to have the matter hushed up. Affairs
dragged , along thus for two weeks and
nothing was ' done about the matter.. -In
the" meantime- O'Donnell lay. ill in bed.
He still offered no :* other explanation
than that he had spent the embezzled
money. At the ) regular meeting of the
Woodmen held Monday evening -a vote
was taken, and it; was decided to cause
the immediate arrest of their faithless
officer. -Accordingly â¢ Council Commander
David Oliver Jr. filed the complaint late
yesterday afternoon. .;
. The fall . ofc the clerk is.due to his un
controllable desire for; liquor. For over a
year he has given himself over to the
excesses caused by the drinking habit.
As a. result he has been 'very ill at times

. \u25a0â¢ A complaint charging John P. O'Don
nell, until December ; 1 of last year col
lecting I clerk for, the Golden : , Gate En
campment of the Woodmen of the World,
with embezzling the funds of that organ
ization, was sworn : to by Council Com
mander David Oliver Jr. -yesterday after
noon and a warrant was later Issued for
O'Donnell's arrest by Judge Cabaniss.
The missing "funds amount, to. about $5000,
and were a part of the benetlt depart
ment maintained by the Woodmen.
O'Donnell accomplished this defalcation
by failing to properly credit payments
made Iby the members on their monthly
accounts. .\u25a0;â¢.-.-' \
Our people are divided aa to a municipal
road. \u25a0â¢- There - are' many opposed-, to It- and
many in favor of It. However, if it Is decided
to acquire tfce read, all good citizens will want
the experiment to be fair and under the best
possible conditions. /'
Herbert E.-Law yesterday fortvarded a
communication to Mayor Schmitz in
J which') he makes certain pertinent sugges
tions, relative to the appropriation of 5350,
000 for the acquisition of the Geary-street
road contained in the budget which is
now \in the hands of the Mayor for his
approval. Law's letter sayrf in part: .
.Either one of two things : should be done In
connection with this appropriation â the amount
â¢it work to bo accomplished should; be lessened
or the- appropriation should be increased. Oil
the city is to operate an electric road on Geary
street it 'i is but common business prudence to
employ none but lirst-clasa construction. ! In .
going: over : the reports and :\u25a0 estimates . of the
engineers . I am left /in much doubt respecting
the character of construction and '\u25a0 equipment
contemplated. ' . i
Is the estimate of $667,595 sufficient to in
sure first-class construction. : equipment â¢' and
operation throughout â¢ the length of : the j pro
posed road 1 : In this connection Ford, \u25a0 Bacon
& Davis, New York engineers, estimate the
cost of â¢ construction and : equipment ' ot 3 two
and a half miles on Sutter street, â¢ from | Mar
ket to Presidio avenue, "at $1.000,000, : against
the city's estimate for four and one-seventh
miles of I the . Geary-street ' road 'at : only two
thirds of a million, a' difference too large . to
be passed unnoticed. â¢ '
,- 1 gather the impression from the engineer's
report that the present rails on Geary, street
are to be - used, and if this Is so it would be
a mistake." The present - electric cars are so
wide that -there Is not ' sufficient, distance-be
tween * the present Geary-street . tracks to '\u25a0 ad
mit their safe ? operation. The present road
bed is Inefficient and the appropriation -must
be sufficient' to permit of putting down a
cement foundation and blocks for a firm road
bed. '

George W. Reynolds, .bookkeeping
expert, was on the stand yesterday In
United States Commissioner Heacock's
court in .the Spring: Valley Water .case.
He recited certain facts connected with
the consolidation of the old city water
works and the Spring: Valley Water
works, which took place in 1865. In
reply to a question by Assistant City
Attorney John S. Partridge he said that
the city waterworks had actually paid
In $790,000 and the Spring Valley had
paid In $1,757,000, the new corporation
issuing 60,000 shares to the stockhold
ers of the par value of $100 per share.
Mr. Reynolds added that the plant of
the old company had gone out of use
many years ago. except the site of the
old pumping station at Black Point.
During IS 65 the consolidated company
paid a dividend of $210,000. or 9 per
cent; during 1866 the dividend was
$300,000. or 11 per cent; during 1867 the
dividend was $360,000. or 14 per cent,
and in IS6S the capital stock was in
creased to $8,000,000 and additional
etock was issued to themselves at $58
per share, aggregating $1,160,000.
