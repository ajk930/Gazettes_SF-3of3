ONE MAN KILLED
AND TWO FATALLY
INJURED BY CARS
Buggy Hurled in Air
and One Occupant
Loses Life.
\killiam Murphy Is
Dead andH. Quigg
Hurt.
Two men hurled high in the air, their
buggy in which they were riding smashed
to kindling wood, one of them dead and
the other probably fatalily hurt, is the
latcm entry In llie street car annals of
death and destruction.
On a well lighted crossing at the corner
of Army and Folsom streets, last night,
an outbound San Bruno Road, car- ran
into a buggy containing William F. Mur
phy of 203 Perry street, a foreman em
ployed in the W. P. Fuller Company's
paint warehouse on Townsend street, and
Henry Quigg. a saloon man who conducts
Â»n establishment 'at Fifth and Harrison
streets. Murphy -was almost instantly
killed and Quigg lies at the City and
County Hospital dying. The accident oc
curred at the base of a heavy^wade be
tween Twenty-fifth and Army streets.
The crossing is well lighted. Why Motor
man E. Melville did not see the buggy
approaching the crossing and why Muiv
phy and Quigg did not observe or hear
the rapidly approaching car, is a mystery
to the police who Investigated the case.
The motorman says the two men were
drunk.
It may have been that the motonnan's
vision was cut off to some extent by the
plant Jof the car on the grade. However,
car No. 673, south-bound, was descending
the bill at a high rate of speed. This fact
Is admitted by Melville, and other carmen*
say that it is the custom to ; run rapidly
flown tiie srade. which ends at Army
Etrect.
Murphy, and Quigg had been at the
Leper Settlement at Army and De - Haro

' BERKELEY, Dec: 21.â Laboring under
the influence of strong drink and spurred
on bj'- imaginaryj command of ., insistent
dentons. William E. Avery; made several
fiendish attempts to kill ; his aged. mother
as she lay on her sick bed shortly before
10 - o'clock this evening ..' at their â¢' '. home,
1410 Nielsen street. After hurling off two
strong men who tried _to hold \ blm|; the
maniac waa finally subdued by a woman's
hypnotic power.
t â¢ This woman, with ; a 'â¢. fearlessness that
seemed to come from the j supernatural;

: Mrs. * Avory will ' probably die i from . the
terrible . shock.
.' Th c , story of Avery's frantic attack on
his ; helpless ; parent is a weird \u25a0 o-"Vr full
of .incidents and ' excitement. It resulted'
inHwo desperate fights, in which; several
persons narrowly, escaped being carved to
death and ended Tonly after the- enraged
man had f, been * firmly.; strapped to the.
floor/where he \u25a0\u25a0 lay shrieking like a fiend
and answering calls; of. phantom beings.
. Avery,. whorls a; cook employed at St.
Joseph's Home, went to his residence last
night, very much under the influence of
liquor. He is a believer in the power of
the spiritsi ts arid when ho imbibes* any j li
quor he 'invariably, acts' like a being pos
sessed. .As soon' as he | reached his homo
he rushed up to where_ hla aged mother
lay in . bed, suffering ; from ] heart 'disease,
and attacked her/ with his .fists. 'â¢.Â».>
HURLS TAVO MEN ASIDK.
The pitiful cries of the old woman were
heard by George Hampton., a neighbor,
who rushed Into the house and grappling
with the ; enraged Avery tried, with
frantic efforts to subdue him. ; But' the
strength of the maniac was ' extraordin-*
ary. Time after time he hurled-Hampton
to the floor, and ; when the latter was ] all
but exhausted, Avery again began 'to 'at
tack, his dying parent, crying out that- the
spirits were 'commanding him ' to kill ' : her
and , answering : their commands with
fiendish yells.': . ' . '
The cries; of the maniac and the moans
of the dying woman aroused Henry'
Brazlack and his wife, Mary,", who reside
in the vicinity of the Avery home. They
entered the house- to' flnd<;the vdemon
driven son {shouting wild cries of fiendish
delight, just as he. was, about to resume
his attack on, his mother.-- ;.
Brazlack ; and : Hampton, .who Iby this \u25a0
time had recovered, at once, hurled them
selves \u25a0 en : : the "enraged \u25a0 maniac fand i tried
to subdue; him.;; But the strength of thÂ©
man again asserted i itself, and he bested
both ' of them with, the greatest | of , ease.
He threw, theni to the floor , time and time
again aiid finally rushed out of the room.

â¢ NEW YORK* Dec v . 2 1.â The sup
pressed facts â¢ regarding, the romantic
marriage of v Judge â¢ Elbert H. Gary, a
dominant force. of the, great steel trust,
to Mrs. Alexander Stevenson Scott wer<*
brought to llghtt to-day.' It was learn
ed that thl3 wedding. took, place within
less, than three and a half . months after
the -'final decree of divorce had. been
granted to Mrs. Scott.
Other interesting facts in connection
with 'the marriage of Judge Gary werÂ«
developed, which, It is believed, have a
bearing on . the fact that \u25a0be la ' one ot
the celebrities "bioarraphed" In . thÂ»
much . discussed "Fads * and Fancies."
The marriage has been tha main sub
ject of conversation among; the picture)
dealers of Fifth avenue since, the an
nouncement was made on December 4,
for the former, husband of Mrs. . Gary
was, until. a short time 1 before . that, a
clerk in the picture and art store ot
Arthur Tooth, 501 Fifth avenue. Ho la
now, at the head. of an Imposing; estab
lishment of his own. Incorporated with
a capital of $100,000,
; Mrs. .Scott was granted an interlocu
tory "decree 'of divorce* from her-hus
band on May 9 last. This decree was
made final on 'August 18." Judge Gary's
present ,wif e .until ;f our years ;ago lived
in comparative obscurity^the wifeof a
clerk, 1 who received" only a -modest sal
ary. Shortly after meeting: Judge Gary
she moved. to the Hotel Seville. When.
she became th* wife of Judge .Gary
they took 'apartments in the Waldorf-
Astoria. - Some time ' before the wed
dmg, Kdltor Wayne of "Fads and Fan

from, him a subscription to the book.
Judge; Gary, .it c i 4 said, paid Jl3OO for
the â¢> article concerning 1 him .whlcn ap
peared ta'Tada and Fancies."
But 'little is known in this city of
Alexander, Stevenson ' '. Scott, former
husband of Mrs. ; Gary, beyond 'the fact
that he was brought to this country by
Arthur .Tooth, , art ; dealer.- The wifa
from "-, whom *he was later separated by
divorce', was formerly - Mrs.' "Townsenci

the matter up to President Roosevelt
if necessary. Possibly, also, prosecu
tions will be sought ";. :\u25a0'\u25a0':\u25a0.
Among the allegations made in the
report are some that may be summar
ized as follows: That 95 per cent ot
the timber and stone entries in six Plu
raas townships were made by dummies,
mostly for T. B. Walker; that Curtis.
Collins & Holbrook have formed a
stock company to handle many placer
locations that they have made in Plu
ms* and Tcliama counties; that all the
"land monopolists will now turn their
attenrion to fraudulent mineral loca
tions, nearly all other avenues to land
fraud being closed to them"; that "W il_
Ham K. Wheeler has his attorneys at
Washington and under the practice of
the department in the lieu land cases It
seems that every possible Impediment
Is placed in the way of the citizen in
his efforts to protect his property";
that in one case Jacob H. Cook, us well
a* his witness. J. P. Standart. were
personally informed by the owner of
'the boundaries ot his mining claim, but
they selected the ground and swore
It in.
BUREAU MAY COVTKST.
Mineralogist Aubury also notified the
Land Commissioner in his report that
Jn the case of the township 26-9 the
Mining Bureau may take a bold stand
and contest the legality of the lieu
la:id sck-ctions as being placed on min
eral land under incompetent and per

Ing the five townships in the forest re
serve. /'
They set forth In substance that the
lands in Question have been for nearly
fitly years actively explored for min
erals: that gold mines of all classes
have been opened; that two of the
townships have been, the greatest gold
producers in California^ that in four
townships valuable and extensive de
posits of auriferous copper have been
discovered and are being actively pros
pected; that timber is absolutely nec
essary for the permanency of' present
mints and for the prospecting and de
velopment of new mines.
PETITIOXKRS PROTEST.
"W" protest," so reads the petition in
part, "against the abandonment of this
mineral land and its attached timber to
â¢the grasp of a few^land. speculators,
who. under various <iueslionable* ana
of len â¢ fraudulent methods', have ob
tained possession of adjoining lands
iiiid under spurious affidavits, permit
ted by a now repealed statute, have
made selections of large tracts of mln
Â«rra! land within the above referred to
townships."
The affidavits of miners that accom
pany the Aubury report were made by
J. B. U Laufman, Gustavus H. Wolters,
13onjam!n Staufer. and Nicholas Kutch
endorf.
As to the extent to which the public
I:iud3 have been taken in by a few men
in Plumas County ifis alleged by th<:
Aubury report that in seven Plumas
County townships; the property of the
F>-tt!rrs and miners -amounts to only
19.* 1f aores, as against it 094 acres
flaltn'ed to have been acquired during
two years by a few land speculators.
Among these are mentioned William K.
"Wheeler up having 12.520 acres;
Thomas B. Walker. 10.04 4 acres. ThÂ«
Yard !iol<?inj?s in Plumas County are
estimated at C 0.550 acres.
11. H. Yard, a ncted mining engineer
end reprt sentative of the Western Pa
cific Railroad here, said last night that
he-folt no uneasiness regarding the pres
ent controversy over land taken up in
Piumas County. Mr. Yard says rail his

as the Plumas forest reserve has been
the scene of active placer mining since
1549. : \u25a0
"Wherever good gravel mines are
found, subject to winter storms, there are
also to be found the finest growths of
timber. To a mining man this Is mining
ground. To the timber man It is timber
ground. The bald hillside that yieius
no gravel grows no timber. For these
reasons discord prevails In the grading
of the character of many of the mountain
tracts of land -throughout the entire
State.
"Many people accuse the lumber men
of securing mineral lands by the use of
script upon the making of affidavits as
to the non-mineral character of the land.
Many also accuse the mining man of se
curing timber lands through, and "by vir
tue of the mining laws and the affidavits
of honest, conscientious witnesses as to
the, mineral character of: such lands.
"Some persons try to draw distinctions
by endeavoring to find the market value
of the land for mining purposes as well
as for the removal of the timber. Such
value depends entirely upon the cost of
the labor for mining and lumbering and
the cost of transportation to the nearest'
market fcr timber. . These comparisons,
however, have never been followed by
the courts, mineral lands being classified
as such If the valuable metals or ores
are found thereinâ this irrespective of all
other conditions.
PAYS OUT LARGE SUM.
"Timber lands are rated aB such only
when the land is covered, with a fine
growth' of timber and has ho metals 'In
Its soil or ores in the rock beneath. Tim
ber lands are sold 'under the timber and
stone act. The price asked by the United
States Government is $2 50 per acre, to
be paid within a few months after appli
cation Is made by the purchaser, and this
without any improvement or occupation
of the land.
"Mining lands, however, must be taken
up under some one of the various min
eral laws. The most liberal of these re
quires the performance of $500 worth' of
work on a single claim before the pros
pective owner is entitled to apply for the
purchasing privilege. After making su<sh
application and performing such work,
he Is then compelled to pay to the United
States Government the sum of $2 50 per
acre, the same price as is asked for the
timber land, which carries with it no re
striction*. . 1
"During the last year I have paid out
the sum of $150,000 for assessment work
alone. I. am preparing :to make even
larger expenditures in the, very near fu
ture, all of which will be of great bene
fit to both the State atid Federal Govern
ment. The land will be very valuable
for mining purposes when the Western
Pacific Railroad is put through, for then
the owners of the mineral lands will be
able to operate their claims on a paying
basis, whereas at the present time such
a thing is utterly impossible."

cut off by the slant of the car. I did
not see the buggy until I was ten, feet
from it. It seemed â¢to shoot from the

I am to blame for the accident. The oc

NEW 1 YORK, Dec. 21.â Francis ,Hen
drlcksrvSUperintendent of Insurance of
New.; York Statei was the chief wit
!nessv to-day "before 1 the legislative ; in
vestigating, committee oh insurance^
He; testified - that the ; examinations of
insurance companies by his department
were .made ,- to ; ascertain only the ' solv
ency, of, the companies, and that no in
vestigation was made" into' the extrava
gance -of v the > management of a< com
pany, or into 'the salaries paid to'offi
cers so; long : as the company was able
to; pay its obligations. /No lnvestlga t
tion was made ; Into ; the commissions
paid to agents,. ; Uie system of loaning
on .the advance of loans to
agents or: loans to directors. The em
ployment of klnspeople of officers in
high , positions 'wasnotinauired , into.
,This; had. long beenithe custom of the
department, Hendricka said, and he de
clared.further that he;personally knew
little or about, the various ex
aminations made, as they were entrust
ed to Isaac -Vanderpool, the chief ex
aminer of the department. â¢>
While Hendricks' memory failed > him
as to any legislation which he had sug
gested as. a remedy for any. defects
the laws' governing* Insurance com
: panies,V'he~said that ho measure that
; he. ever presented had been opposed In
either, house of ; the Legislature.
Neither had .any bills passed, against
, hii recommendation., . - .
\ "Hendricks said his ; department spen t
last year' aboyt ji57.006 and received
in* fees- 5 and payments $287,726, which
wag' paid; into the- State .treasury^ 'To
make examinations that, would bring
out^such information as has been gath
ered^ by the legislative committee, the
witness said,* would Tequlr.e' ten more

tion of'from $50,000 to $60,000. He be
lieved- however,, he: could get the ; ap
propriation If he asked-for It. , \u25a0 .
I >EVER HEARD OF WASH) SALES.
Hendricks knew nothing of the large
legal expenses of the New York JLlfe
insurance Company, the Equitable and
the Mutual Life, as they had never
been -called to his attention. He had
never- heard of : the -wash sales of se
curities nor the. year-end loans of 'this
Equitable to clerks of Kuhn. ;Loeb &
Co., nor had these eyer been brought to
his attention/ " Hughes asked:
'Do you require the companies to present
a detailed statement of thelf legal disburse
ments, â¢showing \ther name's :of j lawyer* who
had . money and . what ..they had it for? Has
the department ever inquired into that? â¢

WABHINGTON, Dec. 21.â The State De

as an incident to a plot for overturning
the Government. In consequence there
were many arrests of prominent men, who
were to be -tried by court-martial to-day.
Among them ,was a former Minister of tho

any feeling against Reyes.
" Mr. Triana, the secretary of the lega

in New .York, said to-night:
â¢ 1 am' at a loss to understand the reason* for

held some time ago made provision whereby

DR. PIERCK'S RBHKDIES.^
READ AND YOU WILL LEARi?
That the leading medical writers and
teachers of all the several schools of
practice endorse and recommend, 5n thn
strongest terms possible, each and every
ingredient entering into the composition
of Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery
for the cure of weak stomach, dyspepsia,
catarrh of stomach, "liver complaint,"
torpid liver, or biliousness, chronic bowel
affections, and all catarrhal diseases of
\u25a0whatever region, name or nature. It is
also a spoclflc remedy for all such chronic
r or long standing cases of catarrhal affec-
tions and their resultants, as bronchial,
throat and lung diseases (except consump-
tion) accompanied with severe coughs. It
Is not so good for acute colds and couchs,
but for lingering, or chronic cases it is
especially efficacious in producing per-
fect cores. It contains Black Cherrybark,
Golden Seal root, Bloodroot, Stone root.
Mandrake root and Queen's root^all of
which are highly praised as remedies for
ell the above mentioned affections by such
eminent medical writers and teachers as
Prof. Bartholow. of Jefferson Med. Col-
lege- Prof. Hare, of the bniv. of Pa.;
Prof. Flnley Ellingwopd. M. D., of Ben-
nett Med. College. Chicago; Prof. John
King. H. D.. late of Cincinnati ,- Prof.
John M. Scndder. M.. D.J [ate of Cincin-
nati ; Prof. Edwin M. Hale. M. D., of
Hahnemann Med. College, Chicago, and
scores of others equally eminent in their
several schools of practice. .
The "Golden Medical Discovery" is tho
only medicine put up for sale through
druggists for like purposes, that has any
such professional endorsementâ worth
more than any number of ordinary testi-
monials. Open pubneity of its formula
on the bottle wrapper is the best possible
cuaranty of its merite. A glance at tnia
published formula will show that "Golden
Medical Discovery" contains no^ poison-
ous or harmful ayente and no alcoholâ
chemically pure, triple-refined glycerine
being used instead. Glycerine Is entirely
unobjectionable and besides is a most
usefnl ingredient in the cure of all stom-
ach as well as bronchial, throat and luns
aflectiflcs. There Is the highest medical
authority for its use In all such cases.
kThe "Discovery "is a concentrated glyc-
*wic extract of native, medicinal roots
and Is saie and reliable. - .

Dr. B. V. Pierce, Buffalo, If. Y.
heartily with the movement to make
James W. Wadsw6rth Jr. Speaker. He
has had several conferences with New
York Republican leaders, and has told
them all that the 'proper thing to do was
to select some man like Wadsworth to
the Spcakership. He'named Wadsworth
to one or two. but he refrained from say
ing anything publicly. \u25a0 . . ., '
The President is anxious- to rid the
party of Odell, and of all Odell influences.
He is also ready to become leader of the
party in Now York, and .is . working to
that end. He has secured- pledges from
many : leading. Republicans, and will, be
behind Governor Higgins in, any move
ment he makes.
A correct, outline, of. the. President's at
titude appears in a statement made at
Old Westbuiy, 1,. i., \\ 0 -day by Repre
sentative Cocks, who is the representa
tive from President Roosevelt's Congres
sional district. Cocks went to see the
President about the attitude of the Nas
sau Assemblyman on the Speakership of
the New York Assembly. Cocks state
ment of the President's attitude is as
follows: , Â»
"The President said that, as a citizen
of Nassau and ;as a constituent of an
Assemblyman, if his advice were asked
he would state that in his opinion Mr.
Wadsworth is an. ideal candidate ' for
Speaker; that it would be the best pos
sible thing, both for the party and for: the
State, if he were : elected; that he pos
sesses very necessary qualities, most
needed in the Speakership at this partic
ular, juncture; that not only is he a man
of ability, of unflinching* courage and
ruggedly aggressive honesty, but ; his
election would mean that'thc Republicans
would have. a Speaker absolutely free
from dictation."
Although this ; statement comes from
Cocks and not from the White House, it
may be stated that it is an accurate pres
entation of the President's views. It is
official. â¢

NEW YORK, Dec. 21.â Former Gover
nor Benjamin B. Odell, chairman of the
Republican State Committee, made.' a
statement to-day in which he /charged
President Roosevelt and Governor Hig
gins with a deliberate attempt" to wreck
the Republican party: of this State for
their own personal ambitions. He de
clared that if disaster ensued,' they, riot
he, would be responsible.
Odell's accusations were a part of his
comment growing out of .the contest" in
the Republican party in this ~ State \u25a0 for
the Speak era hip ".of .New.,, York State'A'a
sembly. Odell declared himself; in; favor
of E. A. Merritt. Jr., several days ago. On
Monday last Governor Higgins .came out
in favor of J. W.Wadsworth Jr. ; Odell
said to-day: ' . '
"I notice that Governor Higgins said
he nsver was .for â¢ Merritt. Shortly after
the election I went to Governor Higgins
and asked him .whom he was " for for
Speaker. He eliminated all. but Merritt,
and said that neither New York nor Buf
falo 1 could have it, because it would stir
up opposition against the cities. T asked
him if Merritt would be satisfactory to
him, and he asked me to see Merritt and
ask him some questions. I saw â¢ Merritt
and reported to the Governor and he
said he was satisfied. I clearly under
stood he was for Merritt and : was never
so surprised as, when he switched his
trolley. This is the worst ' case of du
plicity in politics I have ever . known.
Mr. Merritt is absolutely right in saying
that the * Governor agreed support
him. He offered the Governor to stay
out of the contest if the Governor wanted
hini to do so. .-'^k:' wV;,r^; ' - 'â¢' ' ,

says that 10,000 revolutionaries are under
arms and troops are being concentrated
for the purpose of recapturing the city.
The strike started here at noon very
tamely. In the center of , the city the
shops were not closed, the proprietors
having received guarantees that if they
remained open they would be given ample
protection, and that any deputation of
strikers seeking by threats to force them
to close their shops would be immediately
arrested. There was, however, an im
pressive demonstration in the industrial
sections. Â«
The main interest in the strike of the
railroad workmen centered In the War
saw section, where_ the, Government was
to have made a test of its aDllity by mov
ing a train for Berlin.. The station was
packed with troops. Promptly at noon
there was a wild hurrah, accompanied by
the roar of escaping steam and a few
minutes later the railroad men walked
out of thÂ« yards. in a body. The authori
ties, however, were prepared and after a
delay of ten minutes a locomotive manned
by soldiers of a railroad battalion backed
into the station and was coupled to the
waiting train, which was crowded â¢ with
people seeking to depart from . the un
happy country. Lines of soldiers with
fixed bayonets flanked the train and an
official with four soldiers entered the car
riages and thoroughly searched them in
order to ascertain if suspicious persons
were on board. ;;-.-\u25a0- -v
SOLDIERS GUARD THE CARS.
As the official and his escort left the
train, a. signal was given and. twenty
soldiers entered the baggage cars, while
another detachment was scattered
through the carriages. The train then
pulled out. An extra car laden with
wrecking apparatus was attached to the
train, to be used in case of accidents be
tween stations. The usual, mail car was
missing. At other stations similar pre
cautions will be taken.
In the districts beyond
the Warsaw and Narva gates, ' in the
Schlusselberg district and in ' the sec T
tions on both sides of the Neva the work
men generally, obeyed the summons to
strike and promptly at 12 o'clock thou
sands of them emerged to the street. Po
lice, Cossacks, soldiers of the guard;regi
ments and other patrols were everywhere,
but, so far as reported, no collision marked
the inauguration of the strike. The work
men seemed very quiet, but determined/
The men of each factory selected In'ad
vance a certain number to act aa pickets,
for the purpose of preventing any attempt
to order strike breakers into the fac
tories.
The Narshadney, formerly the . Syn
Ontechestva. and other secretly published
papers, which are being distributed by
thousands to the workmen, are filled with
the most inflammatory appeals, inciting
the people to an armed rebellion. Many
of the articles are especially directed to
the army, which is implored not to shed
the blood of the nation. One writer, ad
dressing the soldiers, said:
"Join us. No power can stand against
the people and army united."
DEMANDS OF THE STRIKERS.
The strike call, in addition to making
the regular demands for a constituent as
sembly, universal suffrage, the abolition
of martial law. Immunity of the person
and the other features of the prole
tariat's programme, insists on the' release
of the imprisoned members of the "Work
men's Council, the discontinuance of! all
political suits, acquiescence with the pe
titions of the army ; ana navy and of the
railroad and postal telegraph employes
and an increase of pay, the transfer of
the land to the people", an eight-hour day
and the, abolition of. all restrictions re
garding \u2666nationalities /and religion. The
preamble says: ,
"Citizens .-.Freedom or slavery. Is Rus
sia to be governed by the people or < ruled,
by a band of thieves? Let us stop in
dustry, commerce and communications
throughout the country and with one
unitedj, effort overthrow the last vestige
of autocracy. To the whip, sword and
machine gun let us oppose , the revolu
tionary bayonet. Financial ruin threat
ens to engulf the Government. One more
blow and the vile regime will be ended."
It Is significant that the workmen in
the mills and -factories have" for more
than a week been presenting demands
that the priests discontinue the usual
prayers for the Emperor, with the alter
native o,f being boycotted if they do not
cease so doing.

revolt was begun ; on . December.' 12, .when'
the revolutionary government * requested
Captain yon Mueller,- who r was stationed
there with fifty infantrynien and forty
dragoons, to withdraw ; the ' military pa
trols from the- streets, because the inhab
itants wished to establish a civilian guard.;
The captain agreed to do this, but forgot
to inform his soldiers, who, upon \u25a0 resum
ing, guard duty,, were .encountered;' "by,
armed agitators. The leader of the latter,
shouted that they had received "Yon Muel-r"
ler's permisslqn . to \u25a0 carry " arms, * but : . the
soldiers. fired on the" agitators and a fight
ensued, in which fifteen - persons ;were

. More dragoons arrived and another fight
occurred. The soldiers finally were com
pelled to retire with ten, wounded,', leaving

the building in which . the officers and
forty dragoons were housed. The officers :
and men tried to escape, but . were \u25a0 pre
vented by the entanglements and we're

windows of the . houses, ' resulting In the
killing of Captain v6n; Mueller -and twen- !
ty-four 'dragoons and:the wounding of an
officer and thirteen. privates... Only three "\u25a0.

fully, mutilated the dead", soldiers.
The next day five" companies" of rein
forcements,^ with three guns, 1 arrived/but
the revolutionaries compelled them to re-"
tire by a fusillade from, the windows. .;
General Chorourichenko" \then ;. ordered
the artillery to bombard the "town. Many
of the inhabitants, .who had not learned
of the arrival of reinforcements,; thought
that terrorists were throwing bombs, and
they fled in a panic in ,all directions.

on the people, killing, according :to the

Bymgton and J udge
Lennon Occupy
Afternoon.
Weary." was the day â¢. yesterday ' in ide-;
partment 11 of the Superior Court, -where
George D. Collins is making . his last des
perate- stand: against conviction on the
charge of perjury.^?A long day it.was
for the defendants who arose at 7 .o'clock
yesterday morning and who was led back'
to his cell at the Broadway Jail after mid
night last night, upon '.the failure of his
twelvemen to r agree upon' a. verdict. A
lone and weary day it was also f for. the
twelve who sat in the Jury box \u25a0 from : 10
a. m. to 5 p. m. listening to the final plea
of the defendant and his relentless prose
cutors, and who retired to the jury room
only to emerge for a short' supper; and
return again until Judge Lennon gave the
order: locking them up . for' the â¢ night. â¢ '
Throughout" the wearisome . day, .. the
courtroom was crowded to the : doors with
the morbid and curious .crowds. â¢ Few ;
among the spectators had actual business
in the courtroom, S; yet they, came and
long they stayed. Young women and girls
predominated. Throughout the day curi
ous men and women thronged the
benches, and during the evening, while
the Jury was locked in the stuffy, .room.,
off the main court, they, still sat patient
ly awaiting the result. The opening ,of a
door, the moving of a bailiff or a .; clerk
was the signal for a craning of necks
and a shuffling of feet. And when 12
o'clock came and the result was yet .in
doubt it was with reluctance *. that ; the
last of the gradually thinning crowd took,
its leave. , ;--
After his last impassioned plea to the
jury in which the defendant exhausted his
almost limitless vocabulary^ of \ invective
ana abuse, launching;. vituperation upon
the so-called conspirators in his case,, the
press of San Francisco, the. Newman
family, and lastly the opposing counsel,
George D. Collins resumed- his seat > to
lfeten to /the ; last arguments of District
Attorney Byington. -
"Whatever were the thoughts of the
man as he listened to the accusations
rolling from; thej lips lof | thei District
Attorney, no look or i move betrayed
them to the watchful spectators.
'Throughout the argument of Byington
the defendant made but one move, and'
that was "a 'whispered remark .to; Cla
rice McCurdy Collins: " ' ' ;'
WIFE ; REIÂ»IAINS COOL.
Comparable with the demeanor of
her. accused * husband was the stoical
behavior of this young woman under
the galling fire of words . directed :at
her husbandry the Yprosecuting attor
ney. Through the day Clarice Collins,
still as gayly dressed :as at the open
ing of \u25a0 the.trlal, read lawbopks, whis
pered comments and consulted with 'the
associated attorneys for the defense â
McPike and Boardman â with the cool
ness of a veteran. 1
It was not. until Judge Lennon had
delivered his charge to the jury and
the twelve men had retired to-thc jury
room that the fortitude and endurance
of the second wife gave _way. and she
was compelled to make her >. way to the
Judge's apartment.-whence she left for
her home shortly after. It was not un
til the Judge had ordered the jury
locked 1 up ; that the waiting woman at
her. home received word from the de
fendant that the jury would not reach
an agreement that night. .
As for ;the defendant; himself he sat
unmoved, during the Haying:;, he re-
ceived by /Byington and only^ upon i
statementi of , law waj3 the Prosecuting
Attorney- interrupted. After^ the inter
ruptlon Collins ; relapsed - into \ a sort o
brown; study,' which he maintained dur
ing Bylngton's -argument and' th<
court's charge to the jury.,;
COLLINS NOT WORRIED.
After the jury retired Collins ro-
I mained in the courtroom'surrounded.by
j friends and attorneys and appeared' the
i least concerned bf those present. \: As
:the minutes lengthened Into 'hours? the
.defendant" became ' restless '.under J I the
influence of the stifling courtroom, but
no look of -anxiety crossed his face and
his . eyes, and ilips ; werevever ready ii.to
break into' a [ smile at -a ; chance - witti
cism iof the : group of .men with /which
he" waSiConstantly surrounded.\i At* the
time the jury went; to ' supper > Collins
availed ; himself â¢ of :.+ the two hours Ito
return , to / the jail, where . ho ; also -dined^
/ and ' reached:' the courtroom >\ shortly
after the jury's return.; From that time
until the court announced" its deter

his case over others onS the calendar, the
depriving him of liberty and embarrassing
him in making his defense. .
He blamed. the prosecution for attempt

she is the defendant's wife. "Had they

Collins. "I i would freely have permitted

Housewife Detected
in Theft Makes
Confession.
OAKLAND, Dec. 21.â Apparently unable
to control a mad desire to possess arti
cles of jewelry for which she had not
t:ie money to pay, Mrs. Emilie Schnoor,
the wife of William Schnoor, a San Fran
cisco machinist, residing at .1605* Felton
stseet in Berkeley, yesterday visited five
lixal jewelry stcrts and stole articles of
adornment, the value of which amounted
to hundreds of dollars. Finally detected
In the act of theft and placed under ar
resi, Mrs. Schnoor broke down and con
fessed that she had etolen the jewelry,
i.-st declared that she could not explain
her reason r for becoming a thief.
Her husband. Informed of his wife's ar
rest and of the proof of her guilt in pos
session of the police, visited the station
this morning, when an affecting scene
took place. The husband, filled wIUÂ«
shame at the plight of his wife, broke
down as ne saw her led from her cell, and
crying. "Oh, Emilie, why did you do it?"
caught his .wife In his arms. With her
voice choked by emotion, Mrs. Schnoor
declared over and over again, that she
did not know what had caused her to
yield to the temptation to steal, j In an
ewer to the questions cf her husband,
ehe eald: "When I saw the jewelry dis
played, I just could not help taking it.
In some of the stores I paid for small
articles, and in the others I bought noth
ing, but Just took the diamonds. You
know 1 never did such a thing before, and
I don't know why I did it this time."
Mrs. Schnoor was arrested at the store
of B. Lissner at 1103 "Washington street,
\u25a0where she was seen by one of the clerks
to eecrete a diamond locket and several
other small articles under her cape when
the thought herself unobserved. Lissner
*t once notified the police, and the wom
an was placed under arrest by Detective
George KytÂ£. who answered the call for
an officer. Â«'hen searched at the police
station, not only the jewelry stolen from
LJssner's store was found in her posses
sion, but also a large number of articles
taken from other places.
Mrs. Schnoor said she could not remem- ;
bcr where 6he had stolen the Jewelry,
but the police on investigating, learned
that ehe had visited the stores of R. W.
lidwards at 1117 Broadway, where she had
stolen three diamond studs and three
emorald iingÂ»; W. N. Jenkins at 10â¬7
Broadway, where three diamond studs
end three stick pins were identified as
the property of the. firm, and the stores
cf William Wilson at 1011 Broadway, and
M. Citro:i on Washington street, near
Twelfth, from each of which a number
of small articles of value were taken.
Chief of Police Ilodgkins said this aft
ernoon that tne \u25a0woman was a puzzle to
him. and that he could not determine
v.hcther the was impelled to theft by
. kleptomania.
For the sake of his only child, Schnoor
Is making an effort to have the case kept
out of the Criminal Court, as he Is con
vinced that his wife' was under the spell
cf Rome unaccountable Influence when
eh* committed the thefts.
Although she was caught In the act of
stealing the jewelry and overwhelming
proof of her guilt was found when she
nas marched at the police station, Mrs.
Schnoor's name has not yet been entered
on the prison register, and co far no com
plaint has been sworn to by any of the
jewelers from whom she stole valuables.
HIRES AGENT
TO KILL WIFE
LOXDON*. Dec. 21. â The trial of Hugh
Watt, the former Member of * Parlia
ment, charged with . inciting hired
agents to murder his divorced wife,
Julia Watt, and Sir Reginald Beau
champ, ended to-day with a verdict of.
guilty. Watt was sentenced to five
rears' penal "servitude.
The Judge in summing up said it was
the most extraordinary case of modern
times. Improbable as was the whole
etory, he thought it was equally as* im
probable that any one could concoct
Rnd swear to such charges. The ques
tion of the sanity of Watt had not been
raised, so the Jury had nothing to do
but find a verdict of guilty or not guilty.
The Judge pointed out that the death of
the former Mrs. Watt would place Watt
in exactly the position he desired as it
would enable him to legalize his marriage
to Lady Violet Beauchamp, which at
present was Ulegel because Mrs. Watt
had declined to have her divorce made
absolute. Her death would also annul the
deed of settlement between Watt and
Mrs. Watt, which Watt desired.

Judge Wells at Martinez to-day dissolved

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Dec. 2Lâ
The members. of the Enciha Club of the
Stanford University. " which is composed
of- the men students living in the large
dormitory, by a decisive vote last night
vetoed the plan of the faculty to intro
duce student control in the building. The*
faculty, suggested that the students nom
inate twenty-four seniors, from whom tne
student affairs committee was to choose
eight men who would act as monitors in
the dormitory. ; All ; disturbances would
be attended to iby these students and if
a student was found guilty of any viola
tion: of .the rules he was to be recom
mended to the faculty for expulsion from
the "hall." This plan was opposed by the
students on the ground>that the position
of. the student ' monitors would expose the
possessor to the ill will of the entire stu
dent body.
Two votes were taken on the matter
which was presented in a letter from R.
L. Green, the. head pf the Students' Af
fairs Commiicee. Tlje plan was vetoed
on the ttrst ballot, but in order to make
sure of the spirit of the community the
second vote was called. The result was

SANTA ROSA, Dec. 21. T The great res
ervoir, dam and "tunnel in the Eel River
country of Humboldt, County which, it
has been announced/were for the purpose
of developing water power for a great
power plant and irrigation schema for
Potter Valley, appears to have another
and much greater object. At a meeting

member of the Council informed his col

a member of the "corporation interested
in the scheme with the request that the
city of Santa Rosa should not take any
action regaramg the permanent-improve

present as hia} company was working out
a" scheme to use the water from the res
ervoir in the Eel River country for do

Councilman", . provided that ; the water
.would be use^fQr^the power plant and
then be turned into pipes; and .carried to
the bay to furnish all the cities en route
with an abundant supply of water. The
pipe line was to run \.o some point on the
bay shore from where It could be taken
across to j. oint Rlchmonu and thence to
Berkeley, Oakland, Alameda, San Jose
and San r rancisco.
The Eel River project is now well un

tunnel is now being, bored through a
mountain, a distance of over v mile, to
carry the water from the. reservoir to
Potter Valley., which is on this side of the
mountains. The scheme created some fear
In minds', of residents and property own
ers along the Russian Rlv^r anil the
country around Ukiah that the water lib

LOS ANOELES. Dec. 21.â 8y the col
lapse of a four-room cottage on Pico
Heights last night during a severe wind
storm three persons were injured, two
perhaps seriously. That thÂ«y were not
kllied outright is regarded as little short
of a miracle. The Injured: Mrs. R. D.
Jewett, bruised about the head and body
Â«nd possibly internally injured. Mrs.
Viola Jewett, her mother-in-law; bruised
about the face and body and suffering
from shock. R. D. Jewett, slightly bruised
about face and hands.
The scene, of the accident was at 1238
Cahuenga street. The Jewetts were oc
cupants of the house, which had not been
erected more than two weeks. In the
same neighborhood, on Harvard Heights,
a new church was carried off its founda
tion and partially wrecked by the storm.
No one was In the building at the time.
Beating down upon the Jewett house
furiously, a wind of high velocity com
pletely wrecked the little cottage, arous
ing the occupants from their sleep and
penning them in as completely as if a
wall had been built about them. The
four wails of the house caved in with a
terrific crash, bringing the roof down
upon them. . ; .
The Jewetts, still In their beds, were
under the wreckage, but miraculously
escaped death. It is feared the Injuries
sustained b>- Jewett's wife may be seri
ous.

storm was at its fury about midnight,

JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Accused of-'naving the antl
poolselling ordinance, William H. Bris
coe (colored) smiled . widely and pleaded
not guilty. But the smile lacked spon
taneity, and- the plea was faltering. Mr.
Briscoe wore a crimson sweater with a
too-wide collar into which his bullet head
frequently retired a la turtle.
"Ah ain't ho bookie," he informed Po
lice Judge Mogan, "en dat yah 'sehtion
'II be cinched w'en Ah pokes in man
*fense."
Patrolman Hervey testified that, having
reason to suspect Mr. Briscoe of poolsell
ing, he "fixed up a job" to ascertain If
his suspicion was well-founded. Hiring
a young man named Alfred Dough-
erty to eerve as a decoy, he scratched
certain symbols on a half-dollar and
dispatched him to utilize it as a
means of finding out whether Mr. Briscoe
was accepting wagers on the great Bear
catcher-Cruzados race last Saturday at
Ingleside. Mr. Dougherty returned to him
and reported that the suspect had readily
taken the money, and when Mr. Briscoe
wao placed under arrest and searched
the marked coin was found In one of his
pockets. â¢"; *".* ;
Called to corroborate his employer's
story, Mr. Dougherty emerged from the
prisoner's . cage, where he was awaiting
trial on the charge of vagrancy, filed sub
sequent to his Inveigling of Mr. Briscoe.
He swore that when he proffered the
four-bit piece and expressed a desire to
bet it on Bearcatcher at the prevailing
odds, Mr. Briscoe grabbed the coin, and
said, "All right. I'll take it."
"Wuz dat all Ah sed?" Mr. Briscoe
asked the witness.
"That was all," Mr. Dougherty replied.
"Yo* am quite suttin Ah didn't say,
'Ah'll tek it outr Be keahful how yo'
aneah, fo' dis am eh mos' 'pohtant p'lnt
ob de case."
Mr. Dougherty was sullenly certain that
no "out" was uttered.
"Mah reason fo* intahjectin' dat yah
queskin," Mr. Briscoe explained to the
court, " 'II bekim patent ez de zamination
p'oceeds."
"Better let ua have it now," said his
Honor.

\ THE SAN. FRANCISCO CALL. -FRIDAY, .'DECEMBER 22, 1905.
James Fagan had shunned tho ; cup that
Inebriates when he was tempted to tipple
by a friend' whom he: had not seen since
their mutual childhood. They met, became
intoxicated and parted in - a , Mission
street saloon, Mr. Fagan' leaving his
friend inert and under the watchful cars
of the bartender.
"When I (hie) realize "how. happy. I am
now -and think of I the fun . I've (hie)
missed during the last two (hie) years,"
said Mr. , Fagan to the mixologist, '"I
(hie) feel like (hie) kicking myself from
here to North (hie) Beach, where I (hie)
live." - . ~
Ab he ambled up Third street, en route
to the North End, his exhilaration r sud
denly demanded amatory vent,, and the
ebullitions were not marked by discrim
ination. -He attempted to embrace and
was repulsed by several amused men and
two or three indignant women ere heÂ«met
Alex Ivanofski, restaurateur, and. be
came fired by desire to possess a portion
of his luxuriant beard..
"Gimme (hie) a pipeful of that spin
nage," Jie-R.aid, clutching at< the Slav's
chin appendage. "Ye've more'n ye've
any (hie) use for,", he exclaimed, mak
ing another futile grab at the coveted
hair, "an' I ain't got (hie)' half enough."
Mr. Ivanofski defended his menaced
whiskers bravely and with \u25a0 admirable
adroitness. He ducked and sidestepped
nimbly, but' for a person so far gone
in inebriety Mr. Fagan displayed* won
derful agility, and finally succeeded:ln
entangling: his fingers in the hirstutal
treasure. The struggle that ensued
conveyed great physical anguish to the
lawful possessor of the bearo\ who
shrieked his sigrony as Mr. Fagan's fin
gers tugged and pulled. The face adorn
ment was saved from spoliation
Just in nick of time by a policeman, who
broke Mr. Fagah's clutch and arrested
him for peace disturbance.
. "If 1 spend Christmas in Jail it'll
break, my heart," said Mr. Fagan, 'sober
and penitent, as he stood, before Judge
Fritz. . % . . . \u25a0 . - '\u25a0QzZ'M-i v/.
The appeal went straight to the heart
of Mr. Ivanofski. who promptly de
clined to prosecute, and the Judge con
siderately made the sentence five days'
imprisonment, thus enabling Mr. Fagan
to spend Christmas elsewhere than in
jail if he po desires. ;
John Brogan climaxed his third fist fight
in Mike Shea's boarding-house," on.- the
600 block of Fourth .street, by drawing
a revolver, challenging Mr. Shea to face
him in duel , and 'also ' battering and
threatening to shoot that gentleman "with
out resorting to the code. He was ar
rested and booked for assault with intent
to commit murder, and - Judge Conlan
committed him for trial in the' Superior
Court, with bail fixed at $2000.
Mrs. Helen Hickey collected from
roomers and appropriated to her own use
a sum of $40 while she was serving as
housekeeper for Mrs. 'Clara Carpenter,
who rents apartments on Powell street,
and Judge Cabaniss sentenced her to two
months' imprisonment. '
John Burrows, arrested in Chinatown
for vagrancy, informed Judge Mogan
that he had not .used opium for " seven
days and consequently felt much better
than he did prior to his incarceration.
"Then about six months In Jail might
restore you to manhood?" his Honor sug
gested.
"Well, about thirty days -would fix me
up, I think," said Mr. Burrows.
"All rightâ thirty days it is," was the
responsive pronouncement.

Within five . minutes District Attorney

trial. He spoke in part as follows:
The defendant at one time In his argument
said : there waa a - deep enmity between hi.n
and the prosecuting 'officer of \u25a0: this court.

He gave' them the usual instructions to

stricken from the record, to pay no at

ALUM ROCK PARK
BONDS DEFEATED
City Attorney of San Jose
Declares Proposition . Did
Not Receive Enough Votes
Special Dispatch to The- Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec 2Lâ ln the opinion of
City Attorney. Brown the. bonds for
$100,000 for the improvement of Alum Rock
Park and for 510.000 for fire house repairs
and new apparatus failed to pass at the
bond election - held on December 13. j This j
is a great* surprised as lit ;,was \u25a0 held that
the entire, bond issue had carried and the
victory, of the Alum Rock, proposition
had been j celebrated j with a brass band
and street parade. The vote had also
been canvassed by.; the \ Common ; Council
and tha result formally "daclared."
' Itlnow appears that the. "charter was
not | properly interpreted at the time the
result 'was announced. The charter pro
vides > that if the proposition at issue be
accepted by ; a two-thirds vote of the
Qualified electors v^*.ng at. the election
the \ bonds may is/*e. \ In counting -. the
vote on the Alum Rock Park and fire
improvement bonds it was apparent -that
more, than _ two-thirds had ; favored, and
the fact was overlooked that many, who
had 'voted on the other; propositions had
not expressed an opinion as to these.par
ticular bonds. However, when the re
turns were examined by City Attorney
Brown he discovered that the votÂ©' in
favor of Alum Rock Park and Fire De
partment improvement fell short of the
required two-thirds of the total vote cast.
; General regret is. expressed at the fail
ure of the bonds, particularly, for the im
provements at Alum Rock Park, and
many still . maintain" that the technical
point raised by the City Attorney may be
; overcome. ;- It is probable that the aues
tlon of the .result ; of the election will bo
determined In the courts.
" Mayor. "Worswick has filed a megsag* to
the City Council vetoing that part of tha
ordinance recently passed; declaring that
all " the ; items : of the late bond election
were : carried.â He holds that . under, the
law the Items relating. to Alum Rock Park
and : . houses . for \u25a0 thÂ© ] Fira Department did
not receive the required two-thirds vote.

THE SHANGHAI RIOTS.
THE small riot in Shanghai, in which only Chinese coolies were
killed and no Americans appear to have suffered, is made the
occasion of much advice to the United States. After all the
evidence is sifted, the cause of the little outbreak seems to have
been in the action of a mixed body with the power of assessment
\u25a0of taxes and exaction of licenses. :. The foreign part of this body
of assessors assumed the right to tax Chinese doing business in
certain parts of the city, the tax not being for the benefit of the
"Chinese Government at" all, but being devoted to the uses of the
foreign settlement. If this right rest upon a treaty it is a revela
tion of the vicious system by which the Western nations have en
croached upon the territorial and governmental rights of China.
Hew long would we endure the levy of taxes upon Americans in
â¢San Francisco by a Chinese Consul Generarfor the benefit of the
six companies?
The trouble has been made the occasion of an imposing naval
demonstration participated in by this country, Japan, Germany and
Great Britain. Before the Russo-Japanese war and Secretary Hay's
declaration in behalf of the territorial rights of China the incident
would have been used as the pretext for seizing the territory of
that empire. The Peking Government with the most commendable
promptness has ordered the Viceroy of the province to punish the
Chinese responsible for the outbreak, which means that they will
be beheaded, no matter whether they are coolies or mandarins. Un
der such circumstances the Chinese Minister at Washington might
proper!}' inquire what steps our Government is taking in the 'case
of the recent mob in California which banished Chinese from one
of our towns by a threat of murder if they failed to go.
It is interesting to read the advice given to us by officers and
foreign residents in China. One official of a European Government
says that the United States should have demanded the immediate
â¢suppression of the boycott on American goods, at the same time
refusing to reform the administration of the exclusion law. This
means of course that we should have used military force to compel
Chinese to trade with us, Nvhile we treated exempt Chinese as
coolies under the provisions of the exclusion act. In other words,
we are advised to inaugurate another "opium war," in imitation of
the course of Great Britain, which is to this day the odium of that
Government in Eastern Asia.
The history of the dealings of the Western nations with China
is' the shame of Christendom. Until the United States entered the
field, declaring a purpose to do justice and t6 exact it from China,
equity and fair dealing were unknown. We need not expect that
all China will immediately respond to our policy of fairness, for
rears of craft and oppression have made the people skeptical, -but
It is our duty to persist in our policy of justice, for it will finally
make its proper impression and secure for us the advantage to which
we are entitled.
Already our attitude has affected Great Britain. As the result
of the assessment of taxes by the foreign assessors in Shanghai,
Chinese delinquents, including women, were imprisoned in the for
eign jail. This, and no anti-American policy, caused the riot. The
British Foreign Office, finding that the imprisonment of Chinese was
the act of the British assessor, has disavowed it and ordered the
prisoners released. Before John Hay's policy was adopted, this
would not have been done. It is evidence that Great Britain real
izes that the "opium war" policy is an anachronism, and that Chinese
'must be accorded human rights in their own country. The British
Government by this disavowal takes its stand with us, and the two
nations appear in alliance in the policy of doing justice and ex
acting it. President Roosevelt has put this policy fqremost in our
dealings with China, and there is no .probability that he will be
driven from it by the copious criticism and advice of Europeans in
China.
We do not want and will not have Chinese coolies in this coun
try. We take this position by virtue of a right that is inherent in all
governments, no matter what their form. It is a right exercised
by virtue of our sole sovereignty and jurisdiction over our own af
fairs and our own interests. But China has the same right of sov
ereignty and jurisdiction over her people, soil and interests. That
right is violated by foreign assessment and imprisonment of her
people. If we are participating in that mean business, we should
get out as soon as possible. We are not aware of any treaty stipula
tion with China that permits it. We have an agreement with China
for extraterritorial jurisdiction, covering American citizens guilty
of offenses in China and of cases, civil or criminal, arising between
Americans and Chinese. This is admitted by China to be necessary, 1
because of the lack of a system of jurisprudence in that empire.
We formerly had extraterritorial jurisdiction in Japan, but that
country adopted a judicial system based upon the common and civil
law of the Western nations, and our jurisdiction was abandoned. It
is to be hoped that the present awakening in China will lead to the
adoption of a like system, so that the extraterritorial courts can, be
abolished. They have always been a fruitful cause of trouble and
should disappear when the necessity for them is ended.
SUFFRAGE IN AUSTRIA.
THE uproar, in Russia caused by the desire of the people to
obtain more power of self-government has been so absorbing to
the world's attention that the great reform , which has recently
taken place in Austria has hardly received the notice it deserves^
Universal suffrage has been granted to the Austrian empire, in
response to popular demonstration in its favor. The kingdom of
Hungary has not as yet received the grant ; but as universal suffrage
in Hungary has been difficult because of its" restriction iri the
empire it is expected that this present grant will -be extended to'
the kingdom and be used as a part of the programme against the
movement for Hungarian nationalism.
Austria being usually regarded as having popular representa
tion in government, the full extent of the change will not be realized
until some details of the old arrangement of representation are given
to show how largely they interfered with fulf manhood: suffrage.
That arrangement really was class rather . than individual repre
sentation. There were five classes â landholders, cities, chambers
of commerce, rural communes and the general class. The first four
of these classes held 353 seats, which represented about 11700,000
voters. The other class had only 72 seats with which to represent
3,601,584 voters. It has been estimated that a dozen landowners'
votes counted for as much as 300,000 ordinary people. The result
of the system has been that both the upper and lower branch of
the Reichsrath has been controlled completely by the wealthy/and
privileged classes. iHH
The term "universal suffrage," as Austria grants it, virtually
means manhood suffrage. There may be some restrictions, but
the essential thing of the reform will be political equality based
on manhood and not on land or titles. It is so vast a victory for
democratic principles that, taken in connection with the reforms
promised in Russia, it seems to augur the coming of a full recog
nition of the right of popular sovereignty., over all "of 'Europe.

i* I tried* to )reasotr thematter out the- other day when I was cutting a gar

never could. It will stretch,. or ruffle,' or. round a curve, and still be highly orna

female brain tips the scale at two hundred grams less carries no weight in this
argument;. ' â .â¢. â¢ ' . ;\u25a0.
- A whole delightful chapter could.be written upon woman and the things she
has made up her mind not to say. Let a woman make; no discreet resolutions
and she is all right to the end of the chapter. But let her resolve to keep her
own counsel, and her obstreperous "mind" will "out" as certainly as if It were

It would seem as if woman and the things she has made up her mind not to

as her/own perplexing self; Is, for, paradoxically, she never has it until It Is gone
from bar forever. .Then she teases, lt over and over again, with "she Balds" and
'â¢I salds," as a. dog fights his battles in his dreams. .
Still woman Is sometimes consistent It does not take a "keep-off -the-grass"
sign to make one who has a lawn of her own stay on the walk.
If a woman has : a good constitution. * she is likely to be content to put up
with it, and not attempt t the masculine trick of trying to live on by-laws. And

when produced in Kurope and in New

"Judith of Bethulia" was written ex

BUCK IS PASSED
TO LOCAL BOARD
Fisliermen's Cove Was Not
Unsanitary Until City Built
Sewers to Drain Into Bay
COMPLAINT IS REVIEWED
Harbor Commissioners Listen
to a Story of the Docking
of the Steamer Prentiss
The Harbor Commissioners yesterday
afternoon reviewed the correspondence
relative to the unsanitary ; condition of
Fishermen's Cove, and in the parlance of
poker, "passed the buck"' back to -the
Health Department and Board r , of Public
Works, San Francisco. Some years ago
the Harbor Commissioners, at an expense
to the State of $20,000, fixed up the cove
Just west of Meiggs Wharf for the con
venience of fishermen. Sanitary \ condi
tions . were all right until the . city built
sewers and deposited the drainage* into
the bay at the cove. 'Now the health au
thorities want the Harbor Commissioners
to abate a nuisance which the city cre
ated. The commissioners . hold , that it is
the duty of the c?Uy to extend the sewer
system to deep water.
. Yesterday the secretary of the board was
directed to notify the Southern Pacific
Company that the bridge over Islais
Creek, near Texas street, should be a
drawbridge which would not Interfere
with the navigation of ' the stream. > Re
port comes to . the board that the railroad
people are spanning the creek with tres

Chief Ensineer Norton of _ the Harbor
Commissioners and George . D. Gray &
Co. are at variance regarding the scope
of damage 'to Harrison street wharf in
the docking of the steamer Prentiss last
September. The. engineer computed the
damage at $40. The ship's side of the story
was given to the board yesterday In this
style:
Board of Harbor Commissioners â Gentlemen:
Received your bill of September 2tt. 1905,
against "Prentiss" for $40 for some damage
.done to end of Harrison-street wharf on Sep
tember 27 at 3 :45 p. m. Outer 200 feet of
wharf had no planking. Stringers were set on
pile heads ready for bolting, but were not
bolted. Ship came to dock on south eide with
ebb tide and pressed loose piling in, thereby
displacing loose cap pieces.
Foreman en the dock agreed with the cap
tain to have his men straighten things after 4
o'clock and suggested that captain give him
50 cents for beer for the Doys for doing. It.
Captain then gave him $1 Instead and was as
sured that a few minutes would fix all the
damage done. As the corner . dolphin - was
adrift and standing out at an angle of 25 de
grees ship could not round on it, therefore
could not dock other than 6he did and was
docked as easily as she could be under the cir
cumstances. Very respectfully,
GEORGE D. GRAY & CO.
The chief engineer listened to the com
munication, but the official record of the
generous, donation of $1 for beer, when
only 50 cents was asked for, did not con
vince him that the assessment of $40 was
excessive. In the absence of Henry J.
Crocker, Commissioners Spear and Mac
kenzie directed that the engineer's ap
praisement should stand as' the judgment
of the board against the ship.
Repnvlnff Between Car Tracks.
City Attorney Long yesterday ren
dered an opinion that companies oper
ating street railways under franchises
from the city and county of San Fran
cisco which Impose no obligation upon
the owners thereof to repave or im
prove other than those Imposed by the
provisions of section 498 of the. ClvU
Code cannot be compelled to repave or
improve under the provisions of an or
dinance subsequently adopted. The
opinion will prevent the Board of Su
pervisors from compelling companies
to remove a pavement between its
tracks and cause to be substituted a
more modern pavement. \u25a0 ".

Dick Adams Shows Him His Countenance
in Magnifying Looking Glass.
â¢** Bob Fitzsimmona it mora badly crashed
â¢In spirit than brokon In body over his
'defeat on "Wednesday night at the hands
' of elusive Jack O'Brien. "How I- did
want to win that fight." we a an expres
sion which came readily to his puffed lips
yepterday aa he lay on a .couch In his
'apartments In the Adams House.
"1 thought I was as good as I ever
was." he said, "but I know" now I was
mistaken. I trained on splendidly- and
could not have been in better condition.
When I started to light I found my brain
land my muscles did not work in accord.
1 would see an opening:, but before I could
take advantage of it the chance was gone.
* I think men In all the professions find ag6
dulls their faculties."
â¢ "I signed articles to fight under the
recognlzod Queensberry rules under which
c .we would protect ourselves at all times.
At the last moment this was changed and
/ I was not allowed to hit when O'Brien
clinched, although both my hands were
free. This handicapped me. as I had to
iet^nany chances pass when I could have
scored to his body."
There is a story, back of th* change in
*ttÂ»e agreement. When the ring was put
up in the pavilion O'Brien measured It
and found it was only nineteen feet
across instead of the required twenty
four.* He at once entered a- strong
protest, as he wanted room in which to
display hiÃ skill as an automaton when
Wading Fitz's blows. As there wai no
Â«thef ring aveilable he agreed to fight 'if
hitting in the clinches and In the break
away,* was barred. This was "agTeed to
ana Uie flsht went tra.
â¢Fitz was asked as to his hands. "They
'are as sound as ever," he said. "Why
â¢â¢shouldn't they be; /I never hit O'Brien
hard" enough to hurt them." \u25a0\u25a0â¢-*'â¢'

â¢ Manager Jim Coffroth had his trouble
\u25a0"".el so. over the permit." Mayor Scnmitz
\u25a0 â¢ failed f.o sign the paper through an over

.â¢doors of the pavilion to be opened until
" the document was produced In. proper
. form. There was a lot of scurrying
about to locate the Mayor. Abe Ruef
. finally accepted the responsibility of hay
.. Ing the paper signed: and the police were

Dick Adams played a cruel joke on
Fitz early yesterday morning. When the
Cornfcshman awakened and had gathered
bis scattered senses it occurred to him
that he would like to take stock of the
injuries inflicted on his face by the wasp-

Esther Woo, a Chinese girl, 13 years

instantly kiiled. She fell a distance

ladder through the skylight to the roof.
While he went to his shop to get some
tools Esther and three girl compan

Kthel Tomâ climbed to the roof. Esther
Woo was sitting on the coping round
* the roof, when she apparently lost her
balance and fell.
Matron Neighbor was in the kitchen

She ran to the rear and found the girl
on the porch, with blood oozing out of
a deep wound in her head. Medical

FITZ RECOVERS FROM PUNISHMENT
\u25a0 \u25a0 /
Ilk* Btlngg of O'Brien's gloves.
Hf called for a mirror and Adams
handed him a large one â¢which magnifies
objects many times. Fitz took one look
at his unlovely countenance and sank
back on his couch with a moan. The
bumps, abrasions and dlscoloratlons
as distorted by the looking-glass
were too much for his unstrung
nerves. The Joke was too good
to keep up and those present laughed
uproariously. Fitz would have Joined in
the festivities, but the condition of his
face would not permit him to even crack
a smile.
Although his face looked badly bruised.
Fitz said he suffered no pain from, the
wounds there. When he went to his
apartments in the Adams House after the
fight he applied two beefsteaks to his
face and slept through the night with
this poultice on. Some stitches were
taken in his lower lip, which was slightly
torn.
FITZSIM.UOXS IS GREAT PAIX.
Fitz suffered great pain from a bruise
ou the thigh- caused by O'Brien butting
him there while ducking out of a corner.
The defeated boxer is to play the lead
ing part next week at the Alhambra in a
play called "A Fight for Love." He prom
ised to attend rehearsal yesterday, but
the flesh was weak and he decided to re
main indoors. He said, however, he
would positively be present this morning.
He remarked that a little paint would
make him presentable, but it will be some
time before his bloodshot eyes clear up
and before his countenance' resumes its
normal shape.
Fitz brought two highly bred French
poodles to this city with him. On Mon
day his collection was increased to nine,
seven puppies being whelped at Alameda.
They are jet black, with the exception of
one dog, which has white markings. This
one Fitz takes especial pride in, and has
already named it after himself. He had
them on the couch with him yesterday,
and was giving the- t. the most tender
care.
Jack O'Brien was about yesterday, with
hardly a mark to show for his previous
night's work. There Is already talk of
matching him with Marvin Hart. He
would make a show of the latter, unless
Hart could land a blow occasionally.
O'Brien has shown in all nis fights here
that he is only flesh and blood, and that
he does not like to be hit. If Hart could
land on O'Brien as he did on Root at
Reno there would be but little footwork
left in the elusive Philadelphlan.

Abundance of Presents.
Many nationalities were represented
at the People's Place Christmas tree
and entertainment held at Garibaldi
Hall. 423 Broadway, last evening, and
hundreds of children and their parents
and friends enjoyed all the good things
provided.
First of all a great bare Christmas
tree proved one of the happy sur
prises, for at the bidding of four sweet
little fairies it sprang wide open with
a myriad it brilliant lights . dazzling
from the toy-laden boughs and reveal
ing a benevolent Santa Claus fairly
beaming with good nature.
. The vast throng, unaware of what
was in store for It, and recovering from
the surprise, burst into prolonged
cheers, which only subsided when
Henry A. Fisk. superintendent of the
Peoples Place, called- for silence, when
the names of the children to be re
warded by good Santa would be an
nounced.
This accomplished, presents in abun
dance were bestowed upon the grate
fu little ones. The entertainment
which preceded the Christmas tree in
cident, proved how diligently the chil
dren had been trained In song and in
recitation.

COLUMBIA STUDENTS
HOOT AT THE FACULTY
Ar<? Dissatisfied With the Ac
tion Regarding Football
and Athletics.
NEW YORK, Dec. 21.â The remarkable
spectacle of ah entire college student
body in open rebellion resulted at Co
lumbia University to-day from the fac
ulty's refusal. to permit* football and other
intercollegiate athletic" competitions.
More than 1300 students gathered in a
body, hissed President Nicholas â¢ Murray
Butler, hooted members of the faculty
and hAlf-masted the university flee. â¢
Underclass cane speeches, were made oc
casion for this expression of disapproval
unprecedented iin college annals. . Gath
ered.in v the university*- gymnasium an
array of students, representing all classes
and departments of the^ college,', were con
fronted by several members of the faculty
when some one started the cry "We want
football.". Instantly { the ; cry, was" taken
up and repeated in a ; rolling chorus for
more than five minutes. Then a voice pro

honors.
There was a little light after this when
Radtke landed Mafalda first for the

the post at 9 to 10, and easily outstripping
her field, wonleasily by a couple, of
lengths. Young Pilgrim fell away to a

The members of the South End Rowing
Club met In their rooms in the Parrott .
building. last night and elected the to&4^
lowing officers to serve during the ensu
ing year: President. Fred Deremer; vice
president, Ray Gallagher; treasurer,
Joseph ODea; corresponding secretary.

P. Foley; captain. Ed Scully: vice cap

until the next meeting: C. H. Noyes. G.
Wright, J. B. Feehan, S. W. Osborn. R.
Wethmann. F. Bergman, J. Simpson. R.
Gallagher and H. Hogan.
This old time organization possesses
one of the finest boat houses on the bay.
The old house at the foot of Third street
was vacated nearly two years ago. Since
then the other rowing clubs have consid
ered the South Sidera dead, as they re
fused to join the new lowing association
and failed to enter crews and the regat
tas. But more important work was to
be done and the members refrained from
taking active part in all festivities.
The location now held by the South
End Club Is on Central Basin, overlook
ing the yards of the Union Iron Works.
This basin Ja gradually becoming a row
ing and yachtinj: headquarters. The
Ariel Rowing Club has built a house next
to the South Ends and launches and
yachts belonging to members are in evi
dence.
A series of races, which promise to>
create considerable interest, are being s^jt&,
ranged by some of the enthusiastic men/^i
bers. There are a number of bank clerks
In the -club and crews will be made up
from among them and ~aces for a prizÂ»
will be held. Those who are interesting
themselves In the matter are: F. Berg
man and E- A. Harley of the Crocker-
Woolworth Bank, and J. Webster of the
Anglo-Californian Bank.
The lawyers may also indulge in some
races. C. A. C. Creighton, J. William*.
J. B. Feehan, T. I. Fitzpatrick, Judge E.
P. Shortall and Judge A. F. Fritz have
all been active oarsmen.

HEACOCK FREES
MERCHANT FONG
Decides That the Chinese;
Inspectors Are Towerless
to Administer an Oath
PERJURY NOT POSSIBLE
Jurist Declares Immigration
Law Has No Bearing Upon
Scope of Exclusion Act
That a Chinese Inspector has no au
thority to t administer an oath was the
decision of â Judge Heacock yesterday,,
and because of that decision 'Fong* Shew,
a'^ Chinese merchant under arrest for
perjury. Was discharged and the case dis
missed. The decision will aboliah the
present method of examining under oath
Chinese" applying to enter or re-enter the
United States, but it is not expected that
much harm will result from the decision,
because "the experience cf the bureau
has-been that a Chinaman's ..word Is as
good as his oath, and that 'neither can be
relied .upon. in An immigration matter.
Fong ' appeared before the Chinese
Bureau recently as a witness on behalf
of a" young Immigrant, whom he claimed
as his son,' and Fong made that claim
under oath before i Chineseâ lnspector
C. Crane. . On a subsequent examination
in the . same case. " when "sweated" by
the bureau officers, he placidly admitted
that he\had not told the truth when he
swore that the Immigrant was his son.
He was. thereupon proceeded against by
the United States District Attorney for
perjury. \u25a0 . '- : .
Before Judge Heacock yesterday George
A. , McGowan, appearing on .behalf of
Fong, raised the contention that the
Chinese exclusion act did not authorize
Chinese inspectors to administer oaths,
and that the Immigration act did not and
could not amend, alter or repeal the ex
clusion act in any particular. He argued
further that the Department, of Com
merce and Labor, while It had power to
make regulations for the enforcement of
the exclusion act; could not make a
regulation the violation . of which would
be a criminal act. McGowan \u25a0 quoted
eeverah cases in support of his conten
tion/

PMN'TER INJURED BY FALL.â Sam
Smith; a painter residing at 406 LarWn street
fell from a . swingis s . staging at 512 > ulton
street yerterdav. The fall resulted In his
breaking his left leg at the hip joint and also
below the knee. Dr. Frank T. TiUman^made
the necessary setting on both parts at the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital. .
Open evenings until Christmas. The public
cordially invited. Sanborn. Vail &;Co. : â¢
four samples of milk showed one taken
from the Johnson" Dairy Company,
Nineteenth and Mission streets, to con
tain only 3 per cent butter fats. One
from the Mill Valley Dairy of A. Sha
piro had streptococci and pus cells and
400,000 colonies per cubic .centimeter,
-and' another submitted by Dr. Canney
had borax -present, in a small amount
and 3,300.000" colonies, the legal limit
being 500,000. .
Health Officer Ragan filed his month
ly report, in which he deals at. length
with the milk problem. Ragan recom
mends a uniform system for the isola
tion of four permanent disease germs
found in milk which are responsible
for many: grave disorders of the stom
ach and bowels. He also recommends
that San Francisco install as one of
its' public utilities a milk depot for
modified milk for. infant use. High
grade milk is brought to these depots
In Glasgow and there sterilized and
pasteurized: according to the directions
of physicians or conipeteiyt persons.

First Speech Since He

SOUTH AJ^RICA TO BE
CLOSED TO COOLIES
Announcement That Colonies
in Southern Hemisphere
Are to Have Elected iParlia
iheiit Is Cheered 10 Minutes
LONDON, Dec. ZLâ^ir Henry Campbell*
Banner man's first speech since he was
elected Premier I waa delivered here to-;
night in Albert Hall before a mass meet
ing: under the . auspices of the Liberal
Federation. The Premier was supported
on the platform by. fifteen members of
his Cabinet. * â¢ >: - ; \u25a0'.
The vast auditorium was packed" with
an audience chiefly composed of London-;
ers. Next to the Premier John Burns was
\u25a0-the hero of the evening 1 . He was ac-:
claimed by continuous applause and mv-
Bical i honors until the picturesque repre
sentative ;of labor.; in the British Cabinet
was palpably emparrassed:
The Premier carefully avoided the Ques
tion of .home rule for Ireland. He. said
that the fiscal question was / the prime
issue of the campaign against a govern
ment whose Ministry "made a midnight
flitting on a murky December evening."
A feature! of Sir Henry's speech was his
announcement that the Government had
decided to stop the importation of coolies
into South Africa until such time as the
Question for or against such importation
could be decided by. a South African Par
liament, elected by popular v vote. : This
was greeted with tremendous enthusiasm,
thÂ© cheering continuing for fully ten min
utes.
Speaking of foreign relations, Sir Henry
first expressed kindly feeling toward Rus
sia in the present trial through which the
country was .passing. In the case .of
Germany, he Bawl no reason whatever for
estrangement and welcomed the unoffi
cial demonstrations of friendship which
had recently passed between the two
countries.
Regarding the United States, Prance
and Japan, the Premier accepted the ex
isting conditions and approved every
thing which tended toward peace. \u25a0
Sir - Henry upheld this announcement
with another which elicited great ap
plause. He said that the growth of arma
ments was a great danger; that force was
not the only remedy, and that economy
must be adopted. The Government would
oppose aggression and would be animated
by a desire to remain on the best terms
with all nationalities and to co-operate in
the common work of civilization. In this,
he .pointed out, the Government had a
notable ally in the present fiscal system,
which was a great guarantee : of peace.
He rejoiced that the principle of arbitra
tion had made great strides, i. ; - : -':- '... ~ ; \. â¢,'-"\u25a0 I,
In'general terms the Premier outlined
his policy for retrenchment and for a
complete system .of government by : the
people, "for the good of the 'greatest
number." In equally general ./ terms he
gave notice* that \u25a0 most \u25a0of the domestic
acts of the late Government would be
traversed by i the j Incoming Liberal Gov
ernment a.nA/he made a powerful bid for
the popular vote.
Women suffragists who had invaded the
meeting waved flags and demanded that
women should be granted the right to
vote..
Sir Henry ignored the interruptions and
several of the- more enthusiastic women
had to be ejected during the meeting.

SPECULATIVE WAVE.
Already Hl^lÂ«, Ileluj? Pushed
Still Hiclicr.
Henry Cltws. the N'cw York backer, says:
"Our etock market has shown a fresh out
burst of feverish activity. The speculative
\u25a0pint la Using iirttistib'.y. end ihls in spite
of restraints imj>^i;Â«-d by coaservatve bankng
Interests end without any rssard ID conditions
Jr. tiie money market. The rtaton for all ibis
Is, of course, unbounded confidence In the een
Â«rai situation ond belief that th< monetary sit
uation will improve .after tha ii:i4<3!e of Jan
uary. If not etrlier. . The extraordinary cut
bu'.-rt in tix* coppÂ«r stacks and their rapid ad
vance, due chieliy to the unprecedented de
ir.tr.il and the. very high price lor copper, have
treatty stimulated speculative . operations in
ether direction*, it has also attracted particu
lar attention to thÂ» Industrials, many of which
Â«r* enjaylt.j a period c:' protix-niy beyond all
Â«xj>ectaUor9. The activity in the eteel and ail
kindred Industrie* con-Jnues uuabated; the
knoÂ«-!eua-e that these corporations are making
unusual profits briny the ba*ls of much of tht
present ejaculation, to sjlv noihlUK of the ef
fect of various merger deals which are in
process of n^srotiatioo. Better class railroad
luuea have been comparatively inflected; but
these, too, *re now recelvinjr increased atten
tion from the new class of operators who are
evidently ccmint lr.to the market.
"The upward tide at present seems almoft
irresistible, an<J there are large numbers who
thick it better to Sf the tide than to bp
posÂ« it. Eixperienced oj>er&tors, however, cau
not shut their eyfÂ» to the increasing' risks of
tbe speculative situation. Stocks are steadily
pese!ng- from sirorjf irto weaker hands, and
tr.riders are likely to iacrtase their sales In
proportion aa ';;>.\u25a0 market advances. There Is
more or less pyramidlnx cf accounts and the
reinvestment of paper profits than usual. These
are elements cf Aanrer, especially In the ab
â¢â¢ence of ar.y thort interest of Importance.
THE BUSINESS SITUATION.
"Our railroad situation continues highly sat
isfactory. Earning* of forty -one roads for the
<*Â»' ih of November Ehowed an Increase of over
t7;*r cent for that month over the larre re
turns of a year, ago. Many of the roads axe
ctlil seriously overtaxed with -traffic, and
there is no . question that much ."of thÂ« new
building proposed up to date Is absolutely nec
tEsary In order to keep pace with the growth
of trade and population in the West. Unless
something happens to Interfere with the pres
ent, progressive movements we are likely -to
Ma considerable new mileage constructed in
the West during the next two years.
"Some idea of the activity cf business can
be bad by the fact that for the eleven months
ending November 80 the clearings in the- Unit
ed States aggregated almost $130,000,000,000. or
Sit per cent ahead of the aamÂ« time laet'year.
This is an extraordinary increase and is well
distributed over: the entire country; although
the gain is heaviest both In volume and per
centage in the cfty of New Tork. where the'
speculative operations "for -the whole country
largely center. Such activity, of course, ex
pleJns in part the stringency in money. High
interest rat^s are certainly more the result of
business activity than speculation. The. lat
tÂ»r Is merely a sequence, and not a cause.
The supply of currency in thÂ© laet two years
has been increased by over $213,000,000, and ia
spite of this fact call loans have been.averag
ing as high as BÂ©lo per cent." . - *

-.... rate for call money advanced to almoct the :
\u25a0Mghest level of the week during the early seÂ»
Â»icn. the result of a Â»udden calling of loans by
local financial institutions. The banks, while
pjparently ahead in their weekly operations,
with the sub-tre&vury. are known to have
trsÂ«ferr*d about $4.000,000 by direct shipment
to Chicago, whÂ«re cash has been In urgent de

The mm mentioned, together with the ship
ment through the eub-treas>ury to the same
oocter. threatens another impairment of thÂ«
legÂ»l reserves of the associated banks. Mone
tary conditions abroad were hardly more en
couraÂ«!n*T than at home. The Bank of Eng-
Jitnd'B meekly statement showed a decrease of
almost $lo.(KK).000 in total reserves, thereby
rfcducinx Its proportion of reserve* to liabilities
to a level much b*low the corresponding week
of the prex'lous year. A number of short ac
counts In Americans were closed In London and
ciierfctioÃS here for that market were small in

more than 10,000 shares. Intimations of a
much blÂ«nÂ«- money rate during the final
week of the year were given out In responsible

end a great deal of the buying was traced to
ecurces having pronounced political affiliations.
The Interborough Company flirured In the day's

list weakened with the early advance of call
money to 13 per cent, from which rate it soon

THE COPPER STOCKS.
BOSTON,' Dec. 21. â Fqr most *pf the session
the market to-day was a continuance of > yes-
Urday's dullness. Prices generally sagged, bUt
there . were no sharp breaks, as : the market
seems to be well' freed of 'stop . orders.";? The
close wai strong. / UnltÂ«d ' States \u25a0 Mining J was
the most active feature, selling up $2 on con
centrated buying by one house; It later re
acted to below. 41. North Butte was the weak
feature. The tone of the market is weak. and
tht.re stems to be considerable stock at or near
the present level.. It Is . understood that, there
is a big stop order in on. North Butte at 75.

was irregular and. unsettled to-day with prices
breaking in the early trading to 20 and i! 4
points from last night's cloÂ»e. \u25a0 Selling was
of a general character from \u25a0Â» the opening to
1 o'clock, with a very largÂ© amount tor Liver
poor and. the Continent.' as w*ll as considerable
further liquidation for Chicago ; and local ac
counts in closing recent purchases." The bear
element naturally took advantage of this pres
sure and their operations, : with some stop-loss
orders, , helped "to make the:, low .; prices. -A
holiday feeling \u25a0 Is ' now \u25a0 settling . over the mar
keu. as Liverpool and New; Orleans, as well
as the New York " market, : will remain / closed

: CHICAGO, I Dec. 21. â The - wheat market was
weak; for the greater part' of the day,'; and un
til late in the session there . was little support
Inevidence. The chief . factor In ; the situation
was the ; Government report, which estimated
the total ' yield : of winter wheat at 428.4U2.000
bushels and spring wheat -at ; 284,516,000 .bush
els.,' These figures were . somewhat larger than
previously, estimated ; by; local * houses. . \u25a0 Bears
were further '^encouraged by the 'Increase . : of
1,000,000- bushels In--, the^ stocks-, of - wheat 'at
Minneapolis and a report that all -mills in that
city, would Rhut -down ' for ten days. V During
the' last hour a telegram ; was received from
an ; English sta'tistlclan ,-; predicting a : marked
decrease in â¢ wheat - shipments '\u25a0 from ; Argentina.
This \yas the first ennourajcement ; of :the day
for the' bulls and created a amount
of covering by shorts.'*- The' result was, : a re
covery, of rart of the early loss.\ The close,
however, was weak. May. opened" s/i(B%cs /i(8%c -to

Poultry and Game.
Dressed Turkeys were -naturally, the leading
feature of the \u25a0 Poultry market yesterday, . but,
as ; on : the preceding , day, . the demand was â¢ not
urgent,', as . retailers !were operating cautiously
and a. great many buyers were inclined to hold
off, awaiting developments. Receipts . -from
domestic points by the early express were
about ,9o. tons. , a;smaller quantity than ex
pected, but most receivers were loth to ad
vance prices, expecting that the bulk of the
stock Intended for the holiday," trade would
arrive to-day. In - some Instances 24c -rÂ«r
pound .was obtained for ; Email parcels of prime
fancy etock, but/ the bulk of the < salee were
at 22@23c, large handlers being willing to etli
at" those \u25a0 figures. . Four, carloads of . Eastern
chilled stock", were at hand- and- were : held, at
21@23c - per pound. : . Live . Turkeys ' were \u25a0\u25a0 In
good supply," but met ' with, a fair, demand ,at
steady rates. Other /kinds of Poultry moved
freely and firm ' prices were S readily obtained
for desirable offerings of Chickens. : Game was
easy and there was. a general decline In prices.

Mrs. Grace Wells. Who Took
Carbolic Acid in Eestau
rant, Is Out of Danger
Pretty Mrs. Grace Wells, who made a
sensational attempt at . suicide at the
Oyster Loaf Resturaht early yesterday
morning, will recover. She was taken
to a private sanitarium yesterday, after
noon. When she recovered consciousness
â¢it the Central Emergency Hospital yes
Â»<*rday morning she made the place .re
sound with her shrieks.
"I want to die," she moaned. "Oh, I
want to die," and became violent. Dr.
Glover, who had \u25a0 saved her from â¢ the
effects of the carbolic acid she had swal
lowed, began to. fear -for her reason. She
was calmed with considerable . difficutly.
Tlir young woman's sister, Mrs. Harry
Oiambj? rlaiir of Hamilton place, Oakland,
visited her yesterday morning and'suc
ceeded in soothing' her.- 'Mrs. Chamber
lain asked that she_ be removed '; to the
sanitarium and this .was done as soon
as her condition permitted it. â¢ â¢
Details of the pretty young woman's
desperate attempt to end her. life are
difficult to get. -The "Oyster Loaf-people
are rwiccnt and Mrs: Wells' companions
are loth to tell anything. It is 'known
l^iwever, . that : she- was In | the place \u25a0Jn
company with "Sig" Heller,' a race track
man; H. Zayas, a traveling salesman of
New York; and a woman whose. Identity
could not be learned. \u25a0â¢>â¢â¢*â¢ .â¢
Mrs.' Wells was in a despondent, mood,
She had a disagreement with Heller," who
had been, befriending her.- She- suddenly,
demanded - that Zayas \u25a0 lend â¢ her â¢' $2.*
"Well, if jou are not going, to, do*aoyÂ«
i hing rash, I will let you' have it," hi
saifl. : ... -: v .<t\ \u25a0---.:.
Mrs. Wells -took the money, saying that
Â«he t wanted to telephone to relatives in
OaJtlaiid.' She: went to the " telephone
booth on. the upper floor. About twenty
minutes, later, a waiter came rushing

downstairs, saying a woman had taken
poison. v
Zayas ran upstairs, and found the
woman writhing. on the floor. While he
was making ineffectual efforts , to revive
her, some one telephoned for 'an ambu
lance. The woman was hurried to the
Central Emergency Hospital, . where Dr.
Glover succeeded in saving her life.
Zayas called at the hospital at 9 o'clock
with a friend, who refused ;to give her
name, and asked if the woman could be
removed to a private sanitarium. He
was told that only her relatives would
be allowed this privilege. Later he vis
ited police headquarters and gave -his
version of the occurrence at the! Oyster
Loaf. He declared that Mrs. Weils was
his guest and not Heller"s at the time.
This is contradicted by friends of both
parties. .
Mrs. Wells is the wife of George R.
Wells, clerk in Judge Cook's "court. She
married him after a week's courtship
and was deserted a week afterward. She
was formerly Mrs. Grace Truett of Sac
ramento.
It is the theory of the police that 1 the
woman telephoned for a messenger " boy
and sent him for the acid. No effort has
been made to learn how she got it.

THE^S/VN FRANCISCO ICALL. FRIDAY.:!;;mL^MBER; 22, - 1905:-
SWEARS DAVIS
WROTE CODICIL
Handwriting Expert Kinsley
Contradicts Statements of
the Local Ghirographists
William J. Kinsley, a handwriting ex
pert from New York, who became famous
by his work in the Molyneux and' Patrick
cases, was placed upon the stand yester
day morning by the proponents of the al
leged forged codicil tothe will of, Samuel
Davis. He swore that in his .best belief
the same man who 'wrote the samples of
writing | before the court wrote the codi
cil. The samples of writing are; admitted
by both sides to be the writing of Samuel
Davis. This expert testimony of Kins
ley is in direct contradiction to the state
ments'of the local experts, who have tes
tified that the codicil, is a forgery.
Kinsley . offered a novel explanation of
the irregularities and differences in /let
ters of .the V writing forming the . codicil.
Â»The codicil shows that,' some of the let
ters, notably j the betters "1". and .."f,"
were -. looped i after the " straight line had
been made,"*! while in other : places these
same letters were made following the Spen
cerian system : of curve writing. Kinsley
explained that the straight : system ;of
writing the line first, then adding the loop,
was the one taught during the early life
of Samuel Davis,- and that he had prob
ably written this way j for many j years.
Then, when the straight system: went; out
of fashion and the; Spericerian system
came Into vogue Davis naturally." picked
up some: of the Spencerian characteris
tics. The, result was that Davis {might
well' write, at a moment whenihe ; waa in
deep study, at times with one system and
at times with ? the , other, i all . in | the * same
document.' Kinsley said that the fact that
both ; r systems ; of - writing' appeared 'i in the
codicil was : proof that; Davis v wrote; the
document, for. no forger could have \u25a0 been
sharp enough to ; ? have V> learned' ; these
qualities, , when, as Kinsley .' explained,
they -.had escaped the notice of thej local
experts^ v \u25a0V'^-;-'^ v--' ;'.- '-- ; -. . :\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0' *<H :^' ; '-' f^ : '

REPUBLICANS
ARE PLEASED
G eorge D. Clark Is Eegarded
as a. Good Trustee for
the ti Mendocino Hospital
. In the gossip'of politicians more than a
little significance -is attached to the ap
pointment of George D. Clark to the
! board of trustees of the Mendodno Asy
lum for the Insane. ,
; The first announcement jof Mr. Clark's
appointment 'was made two weeks ago,
but did not cause public comment at that
time. It" was noted that B. F. Fehnemann
had j resigned \ and ; that j Governor Pardee
had - simply filled the vacancy caused by
such resignation/i; In the Jate municipal
contest in San Francisco Ben Fehnemann,"
Major; Kyle,"- Judge Dibble and a few more
statesmen:who formerly} trained with the
Republicans took the Ruef end.
'George D. Clark,' who was recently com
missioned, by the Governor to serve on the
Ukiah board, is the president of;the Sari
Francisco , ; Republican League. He , was
formerly j president of the Union League
Club. '-"; In local and State ' conventions he
represents' an active following ' in . the
Thirty-seventh Assembly District, where
Postmaster A: G. Fisk resides. The rec
ognition bestowed by Governor Pardee
Hignlfies to the politicians that the Gover
nor iri ; looking about for. a ''man with good
business qualifications did not, pause to
consider; whether --the Ruef elements
would be pleased or displeased. fact
that , Mr.; Clark ". ls ; a \u25a0 member of^ the Re
publican County Committee and president
of the San Francisco Republican League
is perhaps as -well known in the executive
office 'â¢ at , ' Sacramento : as it ', is anywhere
else in California. It is predicted that the
Thirty-seventh' Assembly District will not
send to â¢, the Republican \u25a0 S tate Convention
