bothered look of the man who is more\.
accustomed to using his muscles than
his wit, but by degrees, "with , many:
repetitions and obscurities which:. I
may omit from this naratlve, he laid
his strange story' before us. \u25a0
"It's this way, Mr., Holmes. ' As "I
have said, I am skipper, of .the'Rugger
team of Cambridge varsity, and God- f
frey Staunton is my best* man. -'To--,

we all came up here and we -settled^
at Bentley's private hotel. / At "1 0
o'clock I went 'round and saw that
all the fellows had gone to 'roost,- for
I believe in strict -training and, plenty ?
of sleep to keep a team fit. ,* I. had^aV
\word or two with Godfrey before [hfci
turned In. He seemed to be" pale and \u25a0
bothered. I asked him* what was the I
matter. He said , he was all rightâ â¢*
just a touch of headache.; I bade him
good-nighty and, .left him. : ' Half ari *
hour .later; the porter! tells me^that a ;
rough looking man \u25a0 with -^a beard -.-Â»
called with.anpte for Godfrey. He
had not gone toljedandthe note was
taken to his room. -Godfrey read it |
and fell back ma chair as if he had ,
been pole-axed. The^ porter, was so :
scared that he was goins to fetch" me, '
but Godfrey stopped him/ had a drink
of water and ' pulled -himself toge ther.
Then he .went; <Jbwnstairs v said it.", few
words ,to the man ."who was.v/aiting^in !
the hall,, and-, the. two. of I them
went off together.' The last* that" the ?('.
porter saw of them, they v,*ere almost
running ; down the.' 1 street .in the di-;*
rection of the Strand. This morning
Godfrey's room was empty, his bed
had never beert slept in, and his things
were all just as. l had seehjthem the
night before. He - ! had' zone off at a
moment's notice with this; stranger,
and no word has come from him since.,
Idon't believe, he will ever, come back.
.He was a sportsman, was Godfrey/
down to his marrow, and he- wouldn't"
have stopped = his training and.let t in his
skipper if it H were"not for. some cause,
that was .too strong for him. No;-ir
feel as if he were gone for good, arid .
we should never see him again.'.'. .
Sherlock Holmes listened with'.thet
deepest attention to this naT-
rative. "

As we -had .expected, .the . telegram
*ras soon followed by Its sender, .and
the card of Mr. Cyril Overton. Trinity
Collesre, Cambridge, announced the ar
rival of an enormous young man, six
teen stone of solid .bone and muscle,
who -spanned the doorway *with his
broad shoulders, and looked from one
of us to the other with a comely, face â¢
which was haggard -with anxiety:
\u25a0 "Mr. Sherlock Holmes?"
| My companion bowed!
"I've been down to Scotland Yard,
Mr. Holmes. I saw Inspector Stanley
Hopkins. He advised i.ie \u25a0to i come to
.Tou. He said the case, so far as he
could see. was more in your line than
in that of the regular police.*'
"Pray sit down and tell me what is
the matter."
â¢ "It's awful, Mr. Holmesâ simply
awful*. I wonder my hair isn't gray.
Godfrey Staunton â you've heard of
him,, of course? \u25a0/ He's' simply the
hinge that the whole team . turns on.
I'd rather spare two from the pack, *
and have Godfrey for my, three-quarter
line. Whether it's passing or tackling
or dribbling, there's no one to touch
him, and then he's got the head and
can hold us all together. What am I to
do? That's what I ask you, Mr.' Holmes.
There's Moorehouse, first reserve,
but he is trained as a half, and he al
ways edges right in' on to the scrum
'nstead of keeping out on the touch
line. He's a fine place-kick, it's true,
but then he has no judgment, and he
can't sprint for . nuts. Why, Morton
cr Johnson, the Oxford fliers, could
romp round him. Stevenson is ; fast'
enough, but he couldn't drop from the
twenty-five line, and a three-quarter
Who can't either punt or " drop isn't
worth a place for pace alone.- No,
Mr. Holmes, we are done unless you
can help me to flnd Godfrey Staun
ton."
My friend had listened with amused
surprise to this long speech, which was
poured forth with extraordinary vig
or and earnestness, every point being
driven home by the slapping of a
brawny hand upon the sneaker's knee.
When our visitor was silent'; Holmes
stretched out his hand and took down
letter "S" of his commonplace book.
For once he dug in vain into that mine
cf varied information.

and knocked again without response.
And yet Hhe cottage .was not deserted,
for a low sound -came to our earsâ a'
kind of drone of misery and despair,
which was indescribably - melancholy.
Holmes paused irresolutely and then he
glanced oack at the road which he had
JUst. traversed; A brougham was com
ing down it, and there could be no mis
taking those < gray horses. .-â¢> '
"By Jove, the doctor is coming back! *
cried Holmes. ; '' That settles' it. We are
bound to- seel what it means before he
comes." â¢ ]-":. : . , ,'j
He opened -the door and we stepped
into the hall. ! The droning sound sweil
ed'louder-'upoh our ears until it became
one long, 'deep v wail of distress. It came
from upstairs. ' Holmes darted up and I
followed him. "/He pushed open a half
closed door, and we both stood appalled
at the. sight before us. : .
A : worhan/. young and beautiful, was
lying dead "upon the bed. Her. calm,
pale face, .with dim, wide-opened blue
eyes; looked upward from amid a great
tangle of ' golden hair.' At the foot of
the bed. half sitting, half kneeling, his
face buried In the clothes, was ayoung
man, whose frame was racked by hia
sobs.-. So- absorbed was he by "his, bitter
grief; that he never looked up until
Holmes' hand was on his shoulder.
"Are you Mr. Godfrey Staunton?" â¢
"Yes, yes, I amâ but you are too late.
She is dead." . _ .' "\u25a0
The man was so dazed that he could
not be made to understand that wa
were anything but doctors ;who had
been sent to his assistance.,. Holmes
was endeavoring to utter a. few jvords
of consolation and to explain the%larm
which had been caused to ' his friends
by his 'sudden disappearance when
there was a step upon the stairs and
there was the heavy, stern; questioning
face of Dr.' Armstrong at the door.
' "So, gentlemen,"" said he,. "you hayÂ«
attained your end,' and have certainly
chosen a particularly delicate .moment
for your intrusion. I would. not brawl
in the presence of death, but I can as
sure you that if I were a younger man
your monstrous conduct would not pass
with impunity." . .-,
"Excuse me. Dr. Armstrong, I think
we are a little at cross-purposes." said
my friend, with dignity. "If you could
step. downstairs with us, we may each
be able to give some light to the other
upon this miserable affair." ,
A minute later the grim doctor and
ourselves were in the sitting-room be
low.
"Well, sir?" said he.
"I wish you to understand, In the
first place, that . I am not employed by
Lord Mount-James, and that my sym
pathies in this . matter are " entirely
against that nobleman. .When a man
is lost it is my duty to ascertain his
fate, but having done so the matter
ends so far as I am concerned, \u25a0 and so
long as there is nothing criminal I am
much more anxious to -hush tip private
scandals than to . give | them -publicity.
If, as. I; imagine, there is no breach of
the law in this. matter, you can abso
lutely deperid'.upon my discretion .and 1
my co-operation in keeping the facts
out of the papers." . -- - "
Dr. Armstrong took a quick step for
ward and. wrung Hlomes by. the' hand.
"You are a good fellow." .said he. "I
had misjudged you. I .thank Heaven
that my compunction at- leaving* poor
Staunton all alone in this plight caused
me toitura my carriage. ba"ck. and soto
make your acquaintance. Knowing as
much as you do, the situation is very
easily explained. A year ago. Godfrey.
Stauntc-n. lodged in London for. a time.
arid' became passionately attached to
his landlady's daughter,- whom he mar-,
ried.* .'.She J .was.las^good as.,she was
beautiful*" arid as intelligent as, she was
good."''No v man ' need be ashamed â¢of
such a wife. But' Godfrey was the heir.:
to this > crabbed; old nQbleman..and 4t!.
was quite certain that .the'jnewa'.of his
marriage would' have .been the 'end pÂ£
his lriherltarice. I 1I 1 knew. ..the lad .well,
and I loved hlnr for his many, excellent
qualities.' I did all I could to. help. him
to. keep things' straight. We did bur
very best to keep the thing from every
one, for, when " once . such a whisper
gets about, it Is not long before, every
one has heard it.,. Thanks to this lonely
cottage and his own discretion. Godfrey,
has up to now succeeded. Their secret
was known" to no one save to me and
to one excellent servant," who has at
present gone . for assistance to Tnimo
ington. But at last there came a ter-.
rible blow in the; shape of danKerou3
Illness to his wife." It was consumption
of the most virulent kind. . The ' Door
boy was' half crazed with grief, and
yet he had tog o to London to play, this
match, for he* could not get out of it
without explanations which would ex
pose his secret. I tried to cheer him uo
by wire, and-he sent me one in reply,
imploring me to do all, I could. ;,Thl3
was the telegram .which you appear in
some inexplicable way to have. seen.
I did not tell him how urgent the'
danger was, for I knew that he could
do no good here, but I sent the . truth
to the - girl's father, and .he" very." in
judiciouly communicated It to Godfrey.
The result was that he came ; straight
away in a state bordering on frenzy,
and has remained in the same state. .

this morning death put an end to her
sufferings. That is all, Mr. Holmes. ,
and I\u25a0 am sure that I can rely upon
your i discretion and that, of -your
friend." \u25a0: .

by the fire holding his tiny hypo
dermic, syringe. I associated . that in
strument with' the single weakness of
;his ; ,nature. and I feared the : worst'
when. I saw it glittering in - his hand:'"
He laughed at my* expression of dis
may, and laid it upon the- table.
; '.'No, no, mv dear, fellow, there ds no
; cause for alarm. It is not upon this
.occasion the instrument of evil, but it
,wlll;:rather prove to be the key which

for I propose to get upon Dr.. Am-;

carry 'our breakfast with us, for he is
making an early start. His carriage Is
af.the door." . : â¢ - '

I wiir introduce you to a detective who 1
isa very eminent specialist in the' work
that lies" before, us." -
. When we descended I followed
Holrneo into the stablevard, where -he
opened the door of a loose-box and led
out a -squat,- lop-eared, white-arid-tan
dog," something between a beagle and
a foxhound. - " ,
"Let; me introduce you to Pompey,"
said he. - ."Pompey is the pride of the
local, draghoundsâ no very great flier,
as his build- will show, but a~ stanch
hound on ascent. Well, Pompey, you
'may/not be fast, but I expect you will
be too fast for a couple of middle-aged
:London gentlemen, so I will take the
liberty of fastening this leather leash
to your collar. Now, boy, v come along,
and show what you can- do." He led
him across to the doctor's door. The
dog sniffed round for an instant, and
then with a shrill whine of excitement
started off down the street, tugging at
his leash in . his efforts to go faster.
In half an hour, we "were clear of the
town and hastening, down a country
road. . '
"What have you done. Holmes?" I
asked.
"A' threadbare and venerable de
vice, but useful upon occasion. - I
\u25a0walked into the doctor's yard this
morning, and shot my syringe full, of
aniseed over the hind wheel. : -- A drag
hound will follow aniseed from here .to
John o*. Groats,; and our friends -Arm-,
strong, would have to drive through
the Cam' before he would shake Pom
pey off his trail. \u25a0 Oh, the ciinnirig ras
cal! This is how he gave me, the slip,
the. other night." '.. ,/....- .. -
The dog had suddenly turned but ;
of the main road into a grass-grown
lane. Half a- mile farther this opened
into another road, and the trail turned
hard to the right in the direction of
the town, which we had just
The ' \u25a0. road took a sweep to; the south
of the town, and continued .in the op
posite direction to that in which we
started. . . " :
: ."This detour has been entirely for
our benefit.' then?" said Holmes. "No
wonder that my Inquiries among those
villages led to nothing. The doctor has
certainly played the game for all it
is worth, and one would like to 'know
the reason for such elaborate deception.'
This should be the village of Trump-
Ington to the right of us.' And, by
Jove! here is the brougham coming
round the corner.: Quick, Watson â
quick, or we are done!"
He sprang , through . a gate Into a
field, dragging 'the reluctant Pompey
after him. We had hardly got under
the shelter, of the hedge when the car
riage rattled past. I caught a glimpse
!of Dr. Armstrong within, his shoulders
â¢bowed, his head sunk an his hands," the
very image of distress: % I ' could tell,
by my companion's graver face, that
he also, had seen.' â¢ ,
"I fear there is some dark; ending to
our quest,", said he. "It cannot be long
before; we know it. Come, Pompey!
Ah, it is the cottage in the field!" â¢*:

reached the endof our journey. !* Pom
pey, ran- about and whined eagerly out
:side the. gate, -where . the marks \ot the'
brougham's wheels were still to be seen.
A footpath led across to the lonely cot- \u25a0

hedge, and we hastened onward. My '

our cases I have known one where. the
motives are more obscure. Surely, you
don't really: imagine that he may be

against his wealthy uncle?" _
"I confess, my dear Watson, that
that does not appeal to me as a very
probable explanation. It; struck me,
however, as being the one which was
most likely to Interest that exceedingly
unpleasant old person."
"It certainly did that; but what are
your alternatives?" *

admit that It? 1b c,urious and suggestive
that this Incident should occur on .the
eve of this important match/and should
involve the only" man whose
eeems essential to the \u25a0success 6f the

cidence, but. It is<. interesting. Amateur
sport is free. from betting, but. a; good
deal of outsida betting goes on araorig
the public, and it is possible that ' it
might be worth some one's while to get
at a player as the ruffians of the turf
get at a race horse. There is one ex
planation. A second very obvious one
is that this young man really is. the
heir. of a great property, however mod
est his means may at present be, arid
it is not impossible that a plot; to hold
him for ransom might be concocted.'.'"
"These theories take no. account of

"Quite true, -Watson. The telegram
still remains the only solid thing* with'
which we have to deal, and we* mast
not r>ermit our attention to' wander
away from it.' It is to gain-light up'ori
the purpose of this telegrarn^that we

"In I that, doctor, you will find your

In the country,", said my 'friend,
quietly. \\
"So far as your.'efforts are directed
toward. the suppression of crime, sir,
they must have the support of every
reasonable member of the community,
though I cannoV doubt that, the offi
cial machinery is amply sufficient for
the purpose. Where your calling Is
more, open to criticism Is when you pry
into the secrets of private individuals,
when you rake up family matters
which are better hidden, and when you
incidentally waste the time. of men who
are more busy than yourself. At the
present moment, for example, I should
be writing a treatise instead of con
versing with you."
"No doubt, doctor; and yet the con
versation may prove more important
than the treatise. Incidentally, I may
tell you that, we are doing- the reverse
oV what you very justly 'blame, and
that we are endeavoring ' to prevent
anything like public exposure"- of pri
vate matters which must necessarily
follow when once the case is fairly in
the hands of - the official police. " You
may look upon me simply as an irreg
ular pioneer, who goes in front ; of ;the
regular forces of the country. I have
v.ater 'bus would bring me.- So you
have Instructed a detective?"
"Yes, sir."
"And are you prepared to meet the
cost?"
"I have no doubt, sir, that my friend
Godfrey, when we find him, will be
prepared to do that."
"Eut if h^ is never found, eh? An
swer me that!"
"In that case no doubt his family â "
"Nothing of the sort. *sir!" screamed
the little man. "Don't look to me for a
pennyâ not a penny! You understand
that, Mr. Detective! I am all' the
family that tills young man has got
and I tell you that I am not respon
sible. If he has any expectations it is
due to the fact that I have never v.ast
ed money, and I do not propose to
begin to do so now. As to those
papers with which you are making so
free I may tell you that in case there
should be anything of any value among
them you will be held strictly to ac
count f^rr what you do with them."
"Very good, sir," said Sherlock
Holmee. "May 1 ask in the mean
while whether you have yourself any
theory to account for this youns man's
disappearance?" ;
"No, sir I have not. He is big enough
and old enough to lock after himself
and if he is so foolish as to lose him
self I entirely refuse to accept the re
sponsibility of hunting for him."
"I quite understand your position,"
said Holmes with a mischievous
twinkle in his eyes. "Perhaps you don't
quite understand mine. Godfrey Staun
ton appears to have been a poor man.
If he has been kidnaped it could not
have been for anything which he him
self possesses. The_ fame of your
wealth has gone abroad, Lord Mount-
James, and it is entirely possible that
a gang of thieves have secured your
nephew In order to gain from him some
information as to your house, your
habits and your treasure."
The face of our unpleasant little vis
itor turned as white as his neckcloth.
"Heavens, sir, what an Idea! I never
thought of such villainy! What inhu
man rogues there are in the world!
But Godfrey is a fine ladâ a stanch
lad. Nothing would induce him to give
his old uncle away. I'll have the plate
moved over to the bank this evening.
In the meantime spare no pains, Mr.
Detective! I beg you to leave no stone
unturned to bring him safely back. As
to money, well, so far as a fiver or even
a tenner goes you can always look to
me."
Even in his chastened frame of mind
the noble miser could give us no infor
mation which could help us, for he
knew little of the private life of his
nephew. Our only clew lay in the
truncated telegram and with a copy of
this in his hand Holmes set forth to
find a second link for his chain. We
had shaken off Lord Mount-James and
Overton had gone to consult with the
other members of his team over the
misfortune which had befallen them.
There was a telegraph office at . a
short distance from the hotel. We
halted outside it. \u25a0 .
"It's worth trying, Watson," said
Holmes. "Of course, with a warrant
ye could demand to see the counter
foils, but we have not reached that
stage yet. I don't suppose they re
member faces in so busy a place. Let
Us venture it."
"I am sorry to trouble you," said he
in his blandest manner to the young
woman behind the grating; "there is
some small mistake about a tele
gram I sent yesterday. I have had no
answer, and I very much fear that I
must have omitted to put my name at
the end. Could you tell me if this was
so?"
The woman turned over a Bheaf of
counterfoils.
"What o'clock was it?" she asked.
"A little after 6."
"Whom was It to?"
Holmes put his finger on his lips and
glanced at me. "The last words in it
were 'for God's sake,' " he whispered,
confidentially. "I am very anxious at
getting no answer."
The young woman separated one of
the forms. 4' -
"This Is it. There Is no name," said
she, smoothing it out upon the counter.
"Then that, of course, accounts for
my getting no answer," said Holmes.
"Dear me, how very stupid of me, to
be sure! Good morning, miss, and
many thanks for having relieved my
mind." He chuckled and rubbed his
hands when wÂ« found ourselves in the
street once more.
"Well?" I asked.
"We progress, my dear Watson, we
progress. I had seven different schemes
for getting a glimpse of that telegram,
but I could hardly hope to 6ucceed the
very first time."
"And what have you gained?" ,
"A starting point for our investiga-

J Hospital were giving a paper-

;- JL Townly. The grounds and
house had been lent to them, and the
ladies had planned a supper on the
lawn with a lottery and dance In the
evening. Young girls were to be
dressed as paper dolls and wait upon
the tables. In the evening the young
men must buy their partners for the
dance in the lottery. The girls made
paper dresses, with paper "hats to

walk. * .
"Mildred Little. Oh. she Is in" lav

her son in his troubles, but, did not

before Mrs. Delcoe was aware of her
presence.
"May I serve you?"
Mrs: Delcoe turned . hastily toward ,
the small demure maiden, gowned
from head . to foot in pale lavender
paper, adorned with bunches of vio-

brig had sailed from Genoa, whence
swift couriers had daily brought Teresa
news, for he had small time for. pen
work. To-day the vessel had oast an
chor at Leghorn, her final atop, only
a few. hours away. To-night, since she
put to sea witli the dawn-tide,'.; Gordon
was to come for a last farewell.
As Teresa sat waiting in the garden,
she tried not to think of the to-morrow,
the empty, innumerable tomorrows.
It was already, quite: dark,; for there
was no moon; she 'was; inankfuT for
this, for he could not so readily see her

CHAPTER LiVn.
"My loveâ my life!", he said, and
clasped her close.
"God keep you,'*: she breathed.
He left her and went a few steps into
the . darkness. . She thought -him gone.
But he came back swiftly, his hands
groping.
; He heard a shuddering sob tear its
way from her heart, but she stood mo
tionless in his arfnsrjher cheek grown
suddenly cold against his own.
;In that moment a strange feeling had
come. to her, that they. clasped. each oth
er_ now. for the "last ' time.V It was as
thouglj an Icy hand were pressed upon
her heart, BtlUlng its, pulsations.
She v felt his ;arras againV release her
and knew 'she was alone."
It lacked an hour of day when Gor
don ' rode : into Â« Leghorn, and the" first
streak of \u25a0 dawn strove vainly to shred
the. curdled mist as he stepped 'from a
lighter aboard 'the Hercules. The tide
was at full and a rising breeze napped
the canvas." ; >Â«; .; :
- Standing apart on her deck, his mind
abstracted, though his ears, were hum
ming v.-ith the profane noises of creak
ing cordage, windlass and capstan, he
felt as if the fall of the headsman's
ax had divided his souTTn two. He snw
his ; past rolled up like Â»a useless pa
limpsest in the giant hand "of destiny â
his future an unvexed scroll laid wait
ing for mystic" characters yet unformed
â¢ and . unimagined. Beneath the bitter
ness of â¢ parting -he felt, strangely
enough, a kind of .peace wider than he
had'- ever known. The . hatred " that
tracked,. the Nemesis that had harassed,
he left behind- him.
VAbsorbed in his reflections, he did not
hear - the bawled- orders of the ' ship's
the -splitting crackle, of mus
ketry -from some ship's'hulk near-by in
j the foggy smother. - The brig was lifting:
and pushing as she gained headway.
The* captain spoke at his elbow."
â¢ "Begging* your lordship's pardon, a
man has just come aboard by the ship's
bow chains. He, had a tough swim for
â¢it -and "'a -bullet through the forearm.
Says he .was > shanghaied /by the Py
lade's. If -we put about we'll lose the
tide. 'What are your lordship's orders?"
"Is he Italian?"
/'No. sir. He says he's an English
man/but he looks Lascar."
"His name?" the demand felL sharply.
'- "Trevanion," your lordship."
As Gordon stood . there, breathing
deeply, Teresa, at- home in her room,
stretched at the foot of the crucifix,
was crying in a voice of, anguish, that
icy hand still pressed upon her heart:
"Oh, God! help me to remember that it
is' for Greece, and for himself most of
all!-Help me not to forgetâ not to for
.get::*' -\u25a0\u25a0/ . \u25a0 .. â¢ \u25a0-.\u25a0. \u25a0 â¢ .. . . : . : . - i
'\u25a0 For only an instant Gordon hesitated.
"Let him stay;" he : said;Â« then to the
captain, and turned away, to his cabin.
agre indifference ard insolent disdain
and struggling for a fresh foothold on
lift. The malice that had pursued him
in Trevanion he had accepted unre
sistingly, as part of an ordained ne
cessity. Dut with the unfolding of tho
new conecptic-n and character he had
come to realize that, as the most inti
mate elements olhis own destruction
hail lain within hin:?e!f. so only to
himself could he louk for self-retrieval-
Ai.'d v.as that' retrieval to be tound
in the fatuous passivencES behind
wbkli he had Intrenched himself?
If there \\c;e an appointed des-.
liny, it could hot lie that way, but
rather in the meeting of the issues fate
. offered, the doing of a worthy deed for
the deed's own sake, ihe making real
of an heroic dreamâ putting aside
the paltry pride that caviled how or
why that issue .was presentedâ without
reckoning" save cf the final outcome.
He thought of an oaken box now on
its way to a cemetery in Rome. What
would the man whose ashes it held
have replied? lie needed no answer to
that!
As he pondered, frcm the shadowy
garden under tne orange trees, woven
\sith the warm scents of summer, rose
a soft strain. It was Teresa singing tj
her harp, her voice burdened to-night
with the grief of Mary Chelleyâ the
song Gordon had long ago written to a
plaintive Hindoo refrain.
Low as the words were, they came
clearly into the silence: ;f>' %
Oh! â ir.y lonely â lonely â lonely â pill r w!
Where ts my lev. r? \Â» here I* my lo>cr?
Is It his bark which my, dreary dreams dis
cover?
Far â far away! and alone alons the bii:oÂ»"?
Oh! â my lonely â lonely â l;ncly â tllloxv!
Why trnj.-t my head ache where hla Eintls
brow lay?
How the lons night Cass lovel;Â£sly antffltnrly.
And my head <irco;>s over thee hWe' lY.t
willow!
Gordon's gaze had turned in the di
rection of the sound. He could see l.^r
sitting in her favorite spot, her hair a
dusk of stavligbt, leaning on her harp.
If she only had not sung that â now:
"I do not ask a hasty answer"â Bla
quiere was speaking again â "it is not
a light i^ropusa!. lour lordship will
wish time â "
The man to whom he s:>oke put out
his hand with a sudden gesture.
"Wait." he said.
What need of time? Would a day, a
week, make him more able?* Through
ihe turmoil, of new emotions he rea
soned swiftly. :'Â£%\u25a0'
There were two to consider â th.2
woman he loved, whose singing voice
he heard, and Ada. his child. If for Te
resa's happiness he put aside this cat I,
what then?- A continuance of life in
this fond refuge he had found here in
Italy â In time, peace and quiet, per
hars. But a happiness cankered 'for
them both by the recollection of what
he micht have done, but wopld not.
And for Ada? The knowledge that ha
had once failed a supreme cause. '
The song rose again. Pietro Gamba's
face turned suddenly tender.
Oh! thou. ray -sad ard solitary pll'oT!
Send n:e kind dreams to kce;i my heart tr>m
breaking.
In return for the tears I shed u^on th;e
Tvakine;
LÂ»ft mt-m not illc till he conies back o'er ta&
billow! \u25a0 "*
If he wentâ and did not return.
To die worthily for a great cause
though he be but one of the many
waves that break upon the shore be
fore the tide can reach its mark. To
forward the splendid march of freedom
against the barbarian. To lead Greece
toward its promised land, even though
he himself be, like Moses, destined to
see" it but afar off. The world could
sneer or pralsei as it chose. It might
attribute to him the highest motives
or the most vainglorious. Some time it
would understand. It would have his
memoirs, his final bequest to Ada.
He thought of a picture in England,
hidden behind a curtain lest his
daughter should grow v:> to know
the features of her father.
"By their \u25a0 deeds ye shall kno>v
them" â the saying possessed him. Far
kinder his go!ng for her memory of
him!
Better for Teresa. Her brother re
mained to care for her. She hadin
her own right only the dowry returned
to her from the Guiccioli cc-ffors With
her papal separation. But by selling
Xewstead Abbey â Dallas could ar
range that â he could put h^r beyond
the reach of want forever. Better,- far
for her! In her recollection it would
cover the stain of that life in Venice
from which her hand had drawn him
and leave her iove a higher, nobler
thing. , .
He lift"d his hfÂ»ad suddenly and ad
dressed Blaquiere:
VI will go," he said.
His mind overran the past years. "He
saw himself putting away the old say-
A Rush, vivid en its paleness, had
Â«-oir.e to 'Gordon's ciicek â an odd sensa
tion o* confusion that overspread the
!: t sta;:t's okuion. If the Greek people
loved him. it was for what he had
written yeais Ogoj not for what he was
r.ow, a discrcditf-Â«i wanderer among
the Rations! With what real motive
Â«lid the committee In London place this
great cause in his hard? Did they of
ier Ji in sincere belief, as to one whom
Kr.ffland had misjudged and to whom
she o\.ed restitution â a lover of liberty,
nno capable <"f a true deed, of judg
menl. di*-ccrnment and high results ?
A tingling pang went through him.
Xo. But to one whose name was
V-M::t<i â how farmed! â whose attachment
to tho revolution would draw to ihe
sirugÃle the eyes of the world â to as
suie foreign loans!
H<? rose and wallicd to the window,
his throat tightening. No one spolie.
though yourg Gamba stirred restlessly.
Dallas was pc-frlng Into his recovered
snuffbox and Blaquicre sat movclcssly
v.atchinp.
As Gordon looked out into the dim
ming dusk and the sky's blue garden
blnssominp with palo Â«tars. the. new
self that lxad been developing in con
science gained its ascendancy. What
should It matter to him. why or how
ihÂ«; opportunity came? To Hobhouse,
&{ least, it had been an act of faith and
friendship. As a body, the committee
had considered only Its object, political
advantage to Englandâ the success of
the Gr^ek revolutionary arms. Why
Ehnuld he ache so fiercely for that
jutt^r valuation which would never be
given? Was it not enough that the
cause was one which had been the
brightest dream of his youth; that so
brr opinion deemed his effort able' to
advance It?
As he load, the room was very still.
ThÂ£ deep breathing of the men who
waited seemed io flli it. He heard Bla
qiiierCs voice piercing through:
"The revolution Deeds now only a su
preme lender. Your loidship is known
and Jovcd by the Greek people as is no
othar. Tiie petty chietiains. whose in
â¢\ett;aiÂ«; ambitions row embroil a. na~
tivnai cause, for such a rallying point
v.oulu iÂ£y asivie their qua/rels. \\ r ith
your great name iorcigrn loans would
be certain. Such is fhe unanimous
opinion of the commiliee in London,
ir.y lord."
Dallas' snuffbox dropped to the floor.
Gambit made a sudden movement, but
T.Javrocorciatos hand, laid on his knee,
ttilied him.
For a moment his heart seemed
to t-top. He looked at the sec
ond, glancing at the names af
ttxfcd: "Alexander Hypsilantes" â
"Marco Botzaris" â a dozen Greek
primaics and leaders. The name of
one man there present had been added
â Mavioccrdato.
Gordon took up the first. A tremor
leaped to his lips. He paw his own
credentials, eig:ied by the full commit
tee in i^onuon, as their representative â
in Greece. His eye caught the well
ino\.n. cramped chirography vf John
Hothouse among the signatures.
"Your lordship," he said, "ihe thanks
of our committee are small return for
such a {rift. The jrratitude of Greece
wfU be an ampler recompense. Bui â
1 am here 10 ask jet more lhan thif."
As Gordon gazed inquiringly, he laid
two documents before him on the table:
â¢"Will your loidship read?" . .â¢_
Mavrutordaic's face flushed with
leeling. He turned his eyes on Bla
qui'Tc. A glance of understanding
passed between them and the latter
rose.
Av.<i mu6inÂ« tbere an J;our aicni-.
1 'jrefcmtd that Ure*ce tnirat still be freel
The verse hurrmed in his mind. Was
it >eais ago he had written that? .Or
only yesterday? A dream â that had
b^eri all! It had faded with his other
visions, one day when he had waked
tÂ«j faims when he had bartered them
for the bubble c-f celebrity, the fiitter
peld of admiration! In those old days,
he thought with bitterness, he would
have beer, an eager spirit in the Eng
lish movement. Then he had sat in
Parliament; row he was an expatriate
adventurer, a disqualified attache of
the kir.gless Court of Letters!
One thing he still could do. Revolu
tion i:etded munitic-ns. paiks of artil
lery, hospital stores. Money could fur
rish these â it was the sinews of war.
Ji" such were the object of Blaquieres
visit he should not be disappointed.
He possessed, unentailed, Newstead
Abbey, the .seat of his ancestors, to
whose memory he had clung fondly
through all his Â«,3tracismâ and theie
trese his coal lands of Rochdale. The
latter could be realized on without dif-
Uculiy. His fiEtcr had a private for
ture <jf her own. Ada. his child, had
been provided for at her birth. Itoch-
Oale should bring close upon Â£SO,COO.
He f poke to Blaquiere:
"'Lieutenant. Greece had my earliest

â¢As his gaze, swept over the massed
soldiery the frantic people, the women
on roofs and balconies, 'the houses
hung jwith waving carpetsâ a' rainbow
motley of colorâ a great shout rolled
along the - embankments, a tumult
mingled with handclapping like a silver
rain that drowned \u25a0 all words. Women
in the multitude sobbed, and on the
balconies little children were held up
in stronger. arms to see their deliverer."
Every eye was on that central figure,
with face like the Apollo Belvedere
and a step that halted as if with fa
tigue, but with a look clear and lumin
ous and the .-.shadow of a smile mold-
Ing hla lips.

benefit Gordon had conferred when
he delivered him from Cassidy's ma
rines had become at length Insupport
able. With a. perversion -of reasoning
characteristically Asiatic, he had cho
sen to wipe it from the slate and make
the favor naught. He went to Leg
horn; and to the amaze of Cassidy sur
rendered himself to the Py lades.
Thi3, voluntary act. perhaps, made
vigilance lighter. He watched his
chance, leaped overboard in the foggy
morning, and would have got safe to
shore but for one well-aimed musket.
\Cbacce put the departing brig in, his
way. He had .been delirious In the
forecastle for days from his -wound,
and knowledge of Gordon's presence
and mission had not come to him till
the Grecian shore was la sight.
In his durance on the Pylades h!s
hair and beard. had grown; he fancied
himself unrecognized. Hour by hour,
watching Gordon covertly, seeing him
living and sleeping 'on deck In all
weathers, eating the coarse" fare and
enduring every privation of his sailors,
Trevanion's blood inflamed Itself still
more. He owed the other nothing
now! He raged within himself at thÂ«
celebrity the expedition and its leader
acquired at Cephalonia. In the pur
suit of Gordon's vessel by. the Turks
he had hoped for its capture. "When
she ran upon the rocks he deemed this
certain, and forsook her jubilantly. He
\u25a0had no fear of making his way afoot to
Missolonghi; strangely enough, years
before, during the Feast of Ramaian,
he had fled over this same path to es
cape a Mohammedan vengeance, and
pursued by the memory of a Greek girl
abandoned to the last dreadful penalty
because of him â a memory that haunt
ed him still.
To-day, as Trevanion saw the vessel
that held his enemy, his eye 3 gleamed
\u25a0with a sinister regard.
"Bah!" sneered a voice behind him In
the liomalc tongue. "An English
noblel Who says so? Jlavrocordato.
There are those who say he Is a Turk
in disguise who will sell the country
to the Sultan."
The man who had spoken wore the
dress of a chieftain of lower rank. His
comrade answered with an oath:
"Or to the English. Kalon marabdl!
Give me a chief like Ulysses! In six
months he \u25a0 would have gained - the
\u25a0 whole Peloponnesus, but for thQ com
ing ct" this foreignerâ may a good ball
end him!"
To Trcvanion the malediction was as
grateful as a-^draft of cool beer to the
scorched palate of a waking sot. He
spoke in the vernacular: "There are
English, too, who would drink that
toast! Who is Ulysses?" ;
His faded sailor's rig had been mis
leading. Both clapped hands to their
belts as, "One who will sweep this pup
pet of Mavrocordato's into the gulf!"
the first replied fiercely.
'"May I be there to help!" exclaimed
Trevanion. savagely. "Take me to this
leader. of yours!"
\u25a0 . The tT.o Suliotcs looked at him nar
rowly, then conferred. At length tha
chief came closer.
Vlf you would serve Ulysses," he said,
"meet me beyond the north fortifica
tions at sunset.".
Trevanion nodded, and they turned
away, as a shout went up from the as
sembled people. A boat had swung out
from the brig's davits. It carried a.
flagâ a white cress on a blue groundâ t
the standard of New Greece.
The man .with . the disabled arm
flushed suddenly, for his dark, sullen
gaze had fallen on the sea-wall, where
stood his Highness Prince Mavrocor
datoTwith Pietro Gamba. The latter
had followed Gordon to Cephalonia and
from there had come on the Hercules'
consort. A slinking shame bit
Trevanion as he recalled the day
when his poisoned whisper
would have fired that youngr
heart to murder; he wheeled and
plunged into the human surge.
The couple on the seawall watched
eagerly. The lowered boat had. been
rapidly manned. A figure wearing a
scarlet uniform took its place in the
stern "sheets. The crowd buzzed and
dilated.
The Prince lowered his fieldglasa.
"Thank God. he is safe!" he exclaimed
in earnest Italian. "We have been In
desperate straits, Pietro. With ths
General Assembly preparing to meet,
when all the Western country is In
such disorder, with these untamed
mountain chiefs nocking here wlth
their clans, with Botzaris killed In bat
tle,- and only my paltry five thousand
to keep dissensions. ln check, I have
been prepared for the worst. . Now
there is hope. Look!"
He " stretched- his hand toward the
"teeming quay.' "They have waited for
him as for the Messiah. All the chiefs,
except Ulysses, who has always plotted
for control â and his spies are in the
town at this moment! â will defer to
him. With a- united front what could
Greece not do! The Turk could never
enslave her again. With no supremo
h^ad her provinces are like the untied
bundle of sticksâ easily broken one at
a time!"
They watched in silence while the
rowers drew nearer across thaV shal
lows.
"I did not hope to . see you here.
Pietro," Mavrocordato said affection
ately, as they started toward head
quarters.
Gamba answered simply: "She sent
meâ to guard him If 1 could."
Ten minutes more and the beat waa
at the landing.
The instant its bow touched the ma
sonry before lines of picked troops, a
single bell rang out from the Greek
church.. Other iron tongues took it up.-
The walla shook with rolling salvos of
artillery, the firing of muskets and
wild music, as the man in the scarlet
uniform, colorless and strangely com
posed- amid the tossing agitation,
stepped on shore to grasp the hand of
Prince Mavrocordato, standing with a
long suite of European and Greek of
ficers. '

mind strangely numbed. Gamba, now
acting as his. adjutant,*. was waiting,
and him he dismissed .without dicta ting

were no festivities. " no firing of guns
nor decorations. A pall had settled on
"the town.- a pall reflected in a "sky dun-"
colored and brooding storm. <
To-day/ had been fixed, upon for '-the
march against Lepanto. but now war
was forgotten. Â« The wheels of move
ment had stopped . like those of somo
huge.- machine whose spring of action
has lost its function. Silent soldiers
patrolled the empty bazaar and the de
serted docks. 1 The crowds that thronged
the pavementsâ Suliotes. their wild
faces softened by*- grief unconcealed,
gloomy, officers of infantry and artil
lery," weeping women and grave priests
of the Greek Churchâ conversed In low
tones. .Even the arrival of a new ves

spread . speedily through the despond-,

was a gigantic Venetian servant, stag
gering beneath the burden of an iron
bound chest. Small wonder its /weight

besides bills of exchange- for the sum

for the two*who followed him; v a ven
erable Armenian- friar; 7. bare-headed
and sandaled; and a woman, heavily
veiled, whose. every; nerve was Btrung
with -voiceless ' suffering.
. Mercifully a portion of the truth had
come to Teresa at Zante, and in the
few intervening hours,-/ an i eternity of.
suspense/ she had .gained an unnatural
self-control. Up to the : last moment
of possibility she had fought the dread .
sense of the inevitable. that .was rising
to shut out her whole H horizon of fu-"
ture; .but before the ominous hush of
the multitudes \u25a0 hope ' had died within .
her. She seemed to, hear Mary, Shelley
crying through the voice of that Pisan
r storm: "O, I am afraid â afraid â
afraid!"..,/'; ;
-Yet; even in her, . despair, ras she '
. threaded the press . with the friar, shÂ«

A commotion arose at the instant |
from the courtyard. Mavrocordato *
stepped to the window.: He made an" '
exclamation. The. place was filling '
with Sullotes â they are dragging 'its. J
two cannon from their stations .'and
turning their muzzles against- the -
doors. ." *""i :./'?
An orderly burst into the room. :
"They are seizing the arsenal!" he
cried. v v . ,
With an oath a Swedish ' officer .
leaped down the stair, drawing his L
sword as he ran. He fell stunned by (
the blovv of a musket-butt. â¢ i
Wild figures, their faces and splert- ;,
did attire splashed with mud, gushed :
in, choked the stairway, 'and poured ,
into the narrow apartmentâ to waver -'.
and halt abruptly, abashed. . ;
This was not what Trevanion had" ;
craftily told them of â not/the abode ,
of soft luxury and gem-hung magnifi- '
cence affected by | the foreign archi
strategos. whose wealth was limitless
and who sipped wines of liquid pearls,
while they, their payments, In arrears,
drank sharp raisin-Juice. What they
saw was at strange variance "with this
picture. A chill stone chamber, a
meager repast, uncarpeted floors. , A
handful of men, each with" a 'drawn _
sword. These â and a form stretched 3
on a rough mattress, an ensanguined
bandage about his forehead, a single
gray-haired" servant kneeling by his
side -
The man on the couch rose totter-
I ingly, his hand on his servant's shoul
der.- He was ghastly white, but his
eye flashed and burned as It turned
on those semi-barbaric invaders.
Gordon began to speak â not in the
broader Romaic, but in their own
mountain patois, a tongue he had not
recalled since long years. The un
couth vocabulary, learned in his
youthful adventurous Journey for very .
lack of mental pabulum, had lain in I
some brain-corner to spring up now
with the spontaneity of inspiration.
At the first words they started, looked
from one to another, their hands

The Arclilstrategos.
Missolonghi had become the center ;
of European attention. The announce
ment of the English committee which ,
followed Blaquiere's return to England
was on every tongue. i
The Courier had printed a single
sneering paragraph in which had been
compressed the rancor of William
Godwin, the bookseller. This stated
that- George Gordon was not even In
Greece.- that he was in reality living in
a sumptuous villa on one of the lonian ;
Islands with the Contessa Guiccioli,
writing a companion poem to "Don
Juan." But before the stringent dis
approval with which this bald fabrica
tion was received, the Courier slunk to
shamefaced silence.
Thereafter in the columns of news
paper, pamphlet and majjazine . there
was to be distinguished a curious ten- '.
slon of reserve. It was the Journalistic :
obeisance to a growing subterranean :
yet potent revulsion of feeling. Dallas .
had soon found himself the recipient '
of invitation from influential hosts de
sirous to hear of his visit to Italy. In .
the clubs the committee's bulletins
\u25a0 were eagerly discussed. The loan it â¢
eolicited found subscriptions and the
struggle of the Cross with the Cres
cent â the cause whose beating heart
was now Mlssolonghl â began to draw
the eyes not of London, but of Eng
land: not of England, but of Europe,
not of Europe, but of the world.
To the company gathered in the
citadel of this little marshy port on
the Greek sea-shallows, where free
dom stirred in the womb of war, outer
comment came only after multiplied
reverberations. They toiled ceaseless
ly â a nucleus of hard-working general
officers culled from everywhere â plan
ning, drilling, gathering stores, pre
paring for the inevitable attack of the
Turkish armies massing at Lepanto.
trying to knit into organization the
tawdry elements of brigandage to
which centuries of Turkish subjection
had reduced a great nation. They
labored under a single far-sighted
leadership: that of the archlstrategos
of the Greek forces, whose eye seemed
sleepless and his brain indefatigable.
Gordon foresaw that Greece's great
est enemy was not the Turks, but her
own dissensions. Unification of spirit
and authority was necessary before
aIL When Ulysses, the recalcitrant,
sent him an obsequious embassy it
bore back a terse answer: "I come to
aid a nation, not a faction." Ulysses
cursed in his beard and sent Trevan
ion. for whom he had found more
than one cunning use. to seduce the
Suliote forces camped within the in
surgent lines.
Meanwhile, the money Gordon had
brought melted rapidly. He had con
tributed four hundred pounds a week
for rations alone, besides supporting
batteries, laboratories and an entire
brigade, settling arrears and paying
for fortification. However large his
private resources, they must soon be
exhausted. Could the English loan
fail? And if not. would it come in
time? If it was too long delayed, dis
aster must follow. Discipline would
lapse. The diverse elements on the
point of coalescing would fly asunder.
The issue would be lost. This thought
was a. live coal to him night and day.
. The rainy season set in with all its
rigors. Missolonghi became a pesti
lential mud-basket beside which the
dikes of Holland were a desert of
Arabia for drynees. An unknown
plague fastened on the bazaar and ter
rified the townspeople. But in all con
ditions. Gordon seemed inspirited with",
a' calm cheerfulness. :.
He thought of Theresa continually..
Oddly enough, she stood before him
always as he had once seen her on a.
square in Venice, with moonlight tang- .
ling an aureole in her gpld hair, her
face now not frozen with mute horrorâ
that picture had vanished forever!â
but serene with love and abnegation.
This face lighted the page as he la
bored with his correspondence. It
went with him on the drenching beach
when he directed the landing of can
non sent hy the German committeeâ
more dimly seen this day, for a pe
culiar dizziness and lethargy which -he
had battled for a fortnight was upon
hJm. '/>y
As he rode back through the rain and
the bottomless quagmire. Prince Mav
rccordato and Pietro Gamba sat wait
ing in his room at headquarters. They
had been talking earnestly. The
outlook was leaden. There had been
as yet no news of the expected loan.
The lustful eyes of foreign ministers
were watching. Ulysses had seized the
acropolis of Athens, and his agents
ivere everywhere, seeking to under
mine the provisional government. The
Suliotes. whose chiefs swarmed, in
Missolonghi.' had begun to demand
money and preferment.
But these things, eerious as they
were, weighed less heavily upon
Prince Mavrocordato's mind than the
health of the man he now awaited in
that cheerless chamber.
"Another post would do as well,"
the Greek said gloomily. "Higher
ground, out of the marshes. He stays
here only at risk to himself. Yet he
will listen to no proposal of removal."
"What does he say?" asked Gamba.
"That Missolonghi -is the center of
Western Greece,, the focus-point ot
European observation. , And , he ends
all discussion by the question: "If I
abandoned this castle . to "the Turks,
what would the partisans of Ulysses
say?'"
Gamba was silent. Mavrocordato
knit his bushy brows. He knew the
answer only too well. And yet the
safety of this single individual had
come to mean everything. Without
hhn Greece's organization would be
chaos, its armies rabbles. ,'^ L.
While he pondered, Gordon entered.
He had thrown off his wet clothing
below. The shepherd dog crouched
by the door sprang up with a Joyful
whine as the newcomer dropped a
hand on his "head. *
Pietro' had a sudden vision of .his
sister as she placed upon him her last
injunction â to guard this man's life.
He had done all he could. Yet to
what avail? Watchfulness might ward
Bteel and lead, .but what could combat
the unflagging toil, the hourly, expos
ure, the stern denial of .creature com
fort? His eyes wandered around the
damp walls hung with swords, car
bines and pistols, to the rough: mat
tress at one side, the spare meal laid
waiting: the occupant's hasty, leisure.
In his mind ran the words with .which
Gordon had replied ,to one of his
protests: "Here is a stake worth mil
lions such as I am. "While I can stand
at oil. I must stand here." Gamba's
thought returned ; to what the Prince
was saying: .
"Allow me at .'cast to furnish . this
chamber for your lordship. A bedâ "
"Our Sullotes spread ; their mats on
the ground," was the reply, "or on the
dirt floor of their miserable huts. I am
better, couched , than they."
"They are used to it," protested the

an hour, when her voice had said.
"One 'day, you will finish -it â more

though his ancient enemy had de

in London. .:L These pages were a. brief

His life for Greece And giving it. it
should be his to strike at least i one
fiery blow, to lead one fierce clash of

helmet hunsron the wall, : elaborately
wrought and emblazoned, bearing his
own crest and armorial motto: "Credw
Gordon"â a garish, ostentatious gew
gaw whose every fragile line and over
decoration was a sneer- It had been
brought him in a satin casket by the
hand of the suave. Paolo, the last pol
ished sting of his master, the Count
Guiccioli. He would bring to naught
that gilded mockery of hatred that
scoffed at his purpose A few more
hours and preparations would be com
pleted for the attack on Lepanto. To
storm that stronghold, rout the Turk
ish forces, sound this one clear bugle
call that would ring on far frontiers â
and so the fall of the curtain. - -
At* length he sat down at the table
and, in the candle-light began to write.
: "What he wrote in that hour has been
preserved among the few records
George Gordon left behind him at 111s

The pen fell from his fingers. A sud
den leys, breath seemed to congeal from
the air. He rose â tried to. walk, but
felt his limbs failing him. He fixed his
eyes upon ,a bright spot on the wall,
fighting desperately against the pall
ing faintness that was enshrouding
him. It gyrated and swam before his
visionâ a burnished helmet. Should the
battle after all evade him? "Was it de
nied him even to fall upon the field? A
roaring rose in his ears.
He steadied himself against the table
and shut his teeth: The quiver of con
vulsion was upon . him ; again â and the
movement against Lepanto began to

â¢ "Mother is dead, Jack,** said Jimmy.
"Thank God for that." said the dyinr
man. "I robbed you and I robbed her.
' A woman made me do,itj Jimmy. She
left me for dead in Panama."
His words were faint and his hands
clammy with the dew of death.
"Think of something el3e," said-
Jimmy. "When you're better we will
go to some place where the name of
Henderson was never heard and start'
in on a new life."
There was a curious gurgftngr in the "
dying man's throat and then he wenti
â¢limp. Jimmy knew his brother -wast
dead and for the first time since he;
could remember he cried. Ha tried j
to. think of some prayer, but the only t
one that come to his mind was "NowJ
I- lay me . down to sleep." Even
oft that he couldn't recall the second*
line. A nurse touched him on tho .
..shoulder and said, "The man is dead." J
" He looked at her blankly and arose.}
As. he did so his hand touched some
thing hard and cold banded on his \u25a0
brother's arm. Visions of manacles j
â¢ flashed through his mind. Perhaps j

Jimmy watched the nurse until sh9 j
disappeared 'at the 'end of the court, j

.the dead man's arm. Above the elbow j
was a' bracelet of. pounded. gold, such t
as might have been fashioned : ln some ;

with splendid pearls, evidently
\u25a0â¢the handiwork of a Continental gold- 1

i Jimmy fingered the locket curiously :
and;suddenly it "flew open. He bent}
over,*it in the dim light, and laujhinar,
up'ln his face, beautiful,' seductive,}
triumphant, was a picture of â Elsia, .
One month later Henderson, com
pletely recovered from his wound in
the heart, was sitting at his desk run
ning'over a" list* of -queries from the
New York correspondent. He read un
til he reached No. 14, which said:
"John D. Henderson, prominent Wall
street broker, dies In carriage. 300."
He was \u25a0white for a moment and
then he left the room, standing in the
corridor and vainly trying to put a
match to the cigarette. Presently he
came back and with trembling fingers
he wrote a message. He took It in to
the operator and- said: "Harry, get
this through to thÂ« main offlcf In New
York ahead of everything, with the
most stringent orders for Immediate
delivery."
The operator looked at him curiously
and then at the message. It read:
"John D. Henderson Jr., 146 34th
Street W.. New; York: News Just re
ceived. Shall I come home?
"JIMMY."
A little later the Associated Press
stuff brought In a two-hundred-word ;
story of the death of John D.-Hender
son. prominent capitalist of New York,
who expired In a brougham on his. way
from his office to his home. Henderson
canceled the special query and tossed
the story over to the -man oh the East
ern desk. Presently one of the opera
tors came to the window and slipped
through a sheet of. paper. :
"Here's your answer, "Jimmy," he
said. It, read:
"Come at once. Mother and I both
with Elsie in a background of green
turf and violets-
As he came downtown he dropped
into the theater for the matinee and
she wasn't on the stage. .He met. the.
manager when he passed out and in
quired for her. -/;
"I don't know what's the matter,"
said the manager. "She didn't show
to-day and she didn't telephone she
was sick."
Henderson climbed a hill to where
Elsie roomed. On the way he said to
himself that he was a fool, but still
she might be ill and need something.
The landlady, known of old, answered
his ring.
"It's curious about her, Mr. Hender
son." she said. "She came home last
night and sobbed and wept and carried
on something awful. This morning she
asked me to get an expressman. When
he came she had her two trunks packed
and she sent them somewhere. She
came downstairs with a little grip in
her hand and hugged me hard. and
cried and said she wished she had a
mother. The poor dear! She said if
you called to give you a package she
left."
He took the white parcel, but did not
open it until his night's work was done
and he was in his rooms. In it were
four sprays of forget-me-nots. He
laid them on the mantel and the Jap
anese servant took them away as rub
bish.
When the telephone' rang he hoped It
might, be ehe. He- pawed over the
. flimsy . iand 'A. P. stuff, handing ft out
to"the various readers. Most of/the
\u25a0 epedal stuff he edited himself to'keep
;his thoughts from the girl.. When "30"
! catne from New York and Chicago he
\u25a0went directly home and dragged out a
'few hours of restless dreaming, always
"I dldnT mean to be rude to you,
- Charley," he said. "I'm sort of out
of chape to-night."
Everywhere he went that night he
met men he knew and avoided them.
jln his wanderings for strange places
;he drank more than was good for him
and -when he showed the following
evening at his desk one would have
6carcely recognized James Henderson,
telegraph editor of the San Francisco
Clarion, suave, tactful and capable,
. with a seemingly unquenchable knowl
edge of conditions from Patagonia to
St. Petersburg. /
As a matter of fact he felt rather like
\u25a0Â«. dog. Running over Russian war news
or glancing at an Item from the Alas
kan fisheries little things about Elsie
[popped into his head; the soft ways she
â¢ had; the white arms about his '- neck
when he played some old love song on
the piano, almost forgotten by him and
; never known to her; the Jolly air she
\u25a0held over 'a feast of caviar and beer
when Bhe had refused from . some
' -weathier man a sumptuous supper; the
\u25a0warm welcome she gave- his friends in
\u25a0those two little rooms of hers^what a
good little fellow she was for two years
past. --1 ,
"Oh, go to hâ l," he exclaimed, start
ing across the street. Then he turned
â¢back and shook hands with his invi
tator. \u25a0 â¢**
"Say, Regan," said the man angrily,
"if you would learn to attend to your
own business you'd have a hâ l of .a
eight better chance to keep out of the
fog belt."
The woman turned the corner with
out looking backÂ»and the man went to
thte other corner. Three men came
along and hailed him, but he paid no
attention, to them. Another came by
and insisted on shaking hands, inviting
him to take a drink.
WHEN the waiter threw back
the curtains in a San Fran
cisco restaurant and in
quired. "Ess dere any more,
monsieur?" a young man
.jumped angrily to his feet.
"Get out of here, and stay out. or
lhere'll be something: doing for you."
In that brief vision the waiter had
seen a woman, sobbing* on her arms.
She had on a black hat. cornitured
with white plumes that hardly hid a
wealth of tousled hair, yellow like
ripe corn. The man was clean
eha.ven, square-shouldered and gave
evidences of a plentiful supply of
soap and -water. The waiter closed the
curtains and discreetly withdrew.
The â¢woman was sobbing softly.
"Jimmy." said she. as she raised a
dripping face and crawled over to him,
"you didn't mean what you said, did
you ?"
"I meant every word and I mean it
Etlll,** said the man.
The woman gripped him about the
3cnees while the man continued his
relentless talk.
"You're a beautiful woman and I'm
c poor man. The money I get from.
my newspaper business comes hard
and the money you make in the the
ater comes harder. We can't live as
\u25a0we -wish and we must say farewell. It's
only a matter of a little parting."
The woman broke in.
"I don't care what we make, Jimmy.
Just let me be with you. Let's go to
the mountains ajid we can live on $20
a month. Father, mother and my
self lived on less than that once and
I was happy."
For a while the man was silent,
blowing cigarette smoke Into the air
of the close room. The woman still
clung to his knees, sobbing softly.
"Now, look here." said the man
finally, "there isn't any use arguing
the matter. You know I like you and
that I would do anything in the world
for you. You are the most beautiful
and the most lovable woman I have
seen. Why do you want to throw
yourself away on me?"
*\I want you, Jimmy," sobbed, the
woman.
"We've got to quit now," said the
man. "You have beauty and charm
au4 you should be out looking for
some man with money. Cotton under
wear wasn't made for you. You don't
have to go bark to the life you led
after an outlaw father was killed In
Sonora to support a mother who was
reconciled to the shame for th-e money
you gave her."
The woman raised her head and said
simply, "My father asid mother are
dead vo w. Jimmy, He was always
kind to me."
\u25a0"Dead or living," continued the map.
"when you start out again don't tell
everybody about your past life."
"I rever tcrld any one but you, Jim
my." she pleaded. "I wanted you to
know everything. I've been good since
I knew you."
The man smoked a minute in silence,
\u25a0watching the bowed head of the wo
man, and suddenly he reached out a
hand and tucked in a wandering
strand of her golden hair. She quit
crying; and looked up in his face.
"Elsie," he said, "I want you to be
sensible for once in your life. You have
everything in you to make you dear to
good men except your past. Go out
and find some rich man who can make
; you what you "should be. Get some
man who can afford to see that your
shoes don't run o-er and your skirts
are not draggly."
i She commenced to cry again. "Jim
my, I want you," s=he moaned.
"Well, you can't have me." said the
man. "This is final. To-night is the
â¢parting point," and he arose and rang
tne bell.
"Do you mean it, Jimmy?" she asked.
"Of course I mean If," said he. "It's
better for you and better for me."
I A set look came in her face and her
. gray eyes grew like the color of a new
knife. She dried her face on a flimsy
_lace handkerchief, standing with her
'back to the waiter when he came to
collect the check. When she had h^r
wraps on she went down the stairway,
the man following her. She hurried up
| street, without a glance back and the
j man watched her gloomily from the
doorway. Midway in the block a po
i liceman stood and eyed her furiously,
he sauntered down to where the
' ma,n had moved to the edge of the side
walk.
"What's the matter with the girl to
right, Henderson?" he asked.

"Five"dayB later I 'was awajcened by
Â«n .angel bearing a pint of wine, se- '
but he wasn't the same old Jimmy. J
The death of -his mother following !
closely upon the developments of his
brother's shaipe cut all .the vibrant)
chords of his heart. Settled in mel- '
ancholy.he read and cut and pasted,
and. banded out the news of the world,
but there was no more of the rollick:- .
ing spirit of Jimmy Henderson appar- ,
ent. He worked, slept and ate, but
mostly he brooded.
One night a telephone call came ask- .
ing for Mr. Henderson, personally, and
he answered it.
".This is Dr. Murphy at the City and
County Hospital," a voice said. â¢
"There's a man out here who was '
taken from a sailing vessel this after- '
noon. He's dying from Chagres fever.
If you want to see. him come out at
once." â¢
Jimmy hung up thÂ» -"receiver and '
bundling a great mass of cod y in his
hand threw it over to the coast editor.
."Look, out for this desk. Jess." he > :
said. "I ! may be away for several
hours." v
It was a long street car ride and at
the hospital he fretted away some,
minutes that seemed to him like years. â¢
Finally he was shown to a ward, where â¢
a man - lay dressed in a cheap nisht- :
shirt given to patients who have none \u25a0
of -their .own... He stood beside the <ot ;
trying with all his heart to trace some
likeness in the withered and pallid form
before him to that big brother of his
who had'made easy his way in college
and upon whom he had always looked
as a hero. As he gazed the brown eyes i
\u25a0opened . and the - sick man tried to
stretch his hand 'in greeting, but he'
was too weak to lift it. Jimmy droD
ped beside the cot on one knee, savinc
softly:
"Jack, . old man. Jack, talk to me. .
Brace up, old fellow. You got the*
nerve; just try this once." *
The dying man turned his eyes and
tried *to stir. Jimmy . took , both his
hands and patted them between his
own. : _.
"It's~no use, Jimmy," 'panted the dy
ing man. "I can't tell you aIL It was
a woman who did it. She lured me .
and fooled meâ but Gbdt Td like to .
see her to-night."
"Shut up," said Jimmy. "Let's talk
of that time you made the run around \u25a0
the endâ." -
"This Is - the last talk* I shall ever
make." said, the dying man. struggling
for breath. *'Say whatever you think

Everybody was sorry to lose Jimmy
Henderson. When he -told the manag
ing editor that he had to go East, Hos
kins nearly made a speech. He wasn't
a bad fellow, Hoskins, but he :had for
gotten everything in the "English lan
guage, except the cuss words. The re
porters- said that when he was* made
managing editor he was invited .to ad
dress a woman's convention in Santa
Cruz. He had so much Jto tell them
that the convention- adjourned . in the
middle of his speech,- and since that
time he had never talked except'pro
fanely. ,
Four months later O'Brien went to
New York to grapple with ; the great .
god, Literature, and throw him; if pos
sible, with such a decisive hold that :
newspapers and magazines would,-; in
mad enthusiasm, offer.; him any kind of
a price for what \he deigned to. write^
O'Brien was a particularly good news

everybody was surprised-: to -find him

of such a park as this one.
The wisest course- that this city
could 'adopt would by all means be to
acquire as much land for its parks as
possible, spending as little as possible
upon the Improvement aud mainte-
would undeniably make us a beautiful
and distinguished metropolis, but now
we are almost certain that we are to
have them.
Not only are we certain of Twin
Peaks, but another splendid hill has
been added *? our collection as well,
fiittnotimeJi called Blue Mountain,
be pretty and would afford a quiet
.breathing .place, , but It could be fitted
up so that it would accomplish a great
deal more. In other words, it should
be fitted up as a playground more than
anything else, and in this way, it would,
serve a double purpose. The little ones
who v visit Golden Gate Park are hap
pier swinging ; and riding the seesaw
than they are iany place, else, for they
realize that the section was put in for
their own special amusement, and they
romp and play to their hearts', content.
'There are a number of. novelties that
could be introduced in this â¢ Mission
Park' that arc impossible out In. our,
windy belt; A paddling pond would
delight the heart qf every chick ami
child who could, pull off her stacking.!,
tuck ui> her petticoats and wade In.
Water a -foot deep would not be'* cold,
for the sun would heat it to a certain
temperature, and there would be abso
lutely no danger attached to It.
Such is my idea for the Mission
Par":. There are many harmless en
tertainments that cost but little yet
there id a deal of merriment^ and fun
gotten out of them and more thajn a
little mischief averted at the same
time, to say nothing of the benefits the
children would reap from plenty of
fresh air, sunshine and healthy exercise.
And, by the way, when I, say children,
I mean children, and not small men
and women. It is the little folks un
der 10 who always seem to be caged up
and restless, for they are not old
euough to provide diversions for them
selves and their one thought in lid is
THK people of that favored section
of San Francisco out near -the
' Mission ' Dolores have long clam
ored for a recreation ground, and
â¢it last their demands have been grarit
Â«d. The, two blocks, bounded bÂ» Dolores,
Church, Eighteenth t and y Twentieth
streets, 'where the Hebrew . Cemetery
;. formerly, was, have passed Into the noe
, session of the. city, and plans I are rap-
Idly being, brought tb'a. head for turn-
, Ing the' barren lota Into one of
the niost _ beautiful : parks that ,now
adorn; San -Francisco. Representative
artists, landscape gardeners and
architects have been asked for their
Ideas -concerning the beat decorative
scheme for;the proposedÂ»new ; park. In
several Instances the same .idea was
promulgated:- that," In deference to the
historic. interest attached to that por
-tiotiiOf the city by reason of the furn;
ous old Mission -Dolores,; the general
scheme of adornment 'should be on
| llh Â«, old mission plan. Following are
e 'ldeaa in brief of those who were
proached to* give their Bentlmenta:

rhe^park question is a very com
prehensive and growing subject,
and- it is far too large, too im
portant and too elaborate in de
tail to fully express its importance
upon anything other than long and
thoughtful Btudy. I feel very reluctant
to express myself offhand in this man-
But certainly no other place In thin
beautiful P/J^e oÂ£jG&ll&fflil* presents
HucJb induV/nnit.-* to iho outdoor en-
city whose natural situation lends jit- .
self jideally to adornment. It should;;
have "parks,, parka, and then morÂ« ,
parks. This thing of parka should. bÂ«
made a question of vital Interest be- \u25a0
fore; the entire people and the Super
visors should be pressed for more )
money for parks. As to this. proposed 'J
;pa'rl^: I think 'it .ahould be. laid '.out, on
tlie -lines '.-'of a London ' park: well
wooded, with plenty of -flowers- and
shrubbery, drinking fountains and an ;.
abundance of benches. There are
many such parks In London sprinkled â¢
ihrougU iho heart of the residence
sections."
Amedeo Jouliin, the artist, who has
visited practically every one of the
famous oarLfl of the world, said: -
"I think the plan of having grass,
and plenty -of -U, tlie bÂ«at.vÃut any
plan of adorntr.ent would be wise that
V.'ould serve to attract children and In
duce : them' to make the park their play
ground, instead of the streets. To my
wind a fountain is the nftst beautiful
. adornment that a purk could have, and
the new park should by all, means have
a fountain."
MatK'o Sandoua, ."the young artist
from Veronu, who lias been gaining lo
cal fame 'as a portrait painter, said: ,{, {
"My idea would be to have a park
. laid out on the rustic plan. Have a
"â¢ targe rustic pavilion, where people may
sit in comfort' protected from the strong
rays of the sun and wind. I think It
would be well to have a rustic bridge
cro&sing, Nineteenth street. Have a
playground for children on one side of
1 the park, and have the other portion a
! garden spot. I do not believe in man/

perrecten for Its Improvement and
adornment. * ;
Improvement arid .adornment: ia, of
course^ essential to the general beauty
of a city, but such plans apply more to
the opening of. proper circulating: boule
vards than to anything else. Our. hills
need no improvement 1 or " adornment.
They arc beautiful in themselves and
more beautiful now than they ever will
bej exactly -as they must have been
infinitely more beautiful years ago be
fore -the city was founded and before
their defacement began. Nature un
adoinfid is adorned the moat. "We
should, therefore exert our one rgii?a and
reserve our meager resources for the
purchase of additional land rather
than exhaust ourselves upon ni'Â»re than
the most urgent improvement of .our
present parks. The hilltop purks, il
acquired, ought each and all l>e con
nected by parkways or .panhandles.'
Of course, It will be dlflleult to con
vince oursolvta that'll la our duty U
provide so lavishly and so handsoraeh
for posterity; it 'will be very diflicul
to convince ourselves that it is not ou
plain duty to expend upon ouraelve

slowly. Uut In any event the hilltops

THE NEW MISSION PARKmarred by pencil marks, lay on the
table near at hand. It was a good
etory, he felt sure, although there were
two or three details concerning which
he would have liked a conservative
opinion, "i'il take Virginia out - for
read you a line I'm sending to a
friend of mine at Daly's. Rather a
clever letter, you know."
Claxton tore; himself away and went
back home. What was Miss Carter
doing? He would have wagered a
hundred that Phelps*had called and
taken her out. Confound Phelps!
The story went more smoothly,
stimulated by the resentful energy of
its author. From 10 o'clock until near

seven pages of manuscript, much

"Funny," mused Claxton. ( "By
George, I wonder If there's any one
in the place."^ __
There was f In the~~ writing- roomâ
Frederick Ford Ferguson, a youth Just
coaxing a timorous* mustache into ex
istence and \u25ba tolerated only for the sake
of his father, Major Ferguson, formerly
of the Ninth Infantry. Claxton would
gladly have passed the youngster by,
but he was hailed before he could re
gain Ihe hall.
"Stop a bit, old chap. I want to
the stupid fellow of his membership, he
sauntered into the lounging room, he
was in an exceedingly unpleasant hu
mor. ' "Parsons been^herc this even-
Ing?" he inquired brusquely of an at'
tendant.
"No, sir," replied 'tl.i man. "He
Jfloesn't come very often now, sir. Mar
ried, I believe."
Claxton cursed Parsons from the bot
tom of his soul.
"Graham?" he asked...
"Mr.; Graham was In about a week
ago. We don't see him more than once
the one letter and return the rest to
her.
To do this he must read every epistle
in the nine bundles. Claxton, in com
mon with most men who write or act,
wa3 a sentimentalist, and he wtuued
that the one letter should be the dear
est of all. The first that met hla eye
ha laid aside In the belief that it would
prove the dearest. Miss Carter.. ha<i;
penned it when he lay ill of fever at
San Jose da Guatemala, "Your cable
was, repeated to me at Chicago," was
the message. "Otherwise I should hava
been with you now. I know that if
yaur illness continued you would need a
luncheon and read it to her," he
thought. Then he remembered that
they had agreed never to Bee each
other againâ voluntarily, that is.
The day, which began with his rising
at noon, dragged along monotonously.
It was hard to realize that he might
not speak to her over the telephone
that stood on 1113 desk, and harder
still to be convinced that she would
not call him up. Toward mid-after
noon Claxton unlocked a drawer and
took out the nine packages of her
letters that represented a correspond
ence of three years. He must choose
nurse, and I felt that I could not dele
gate to strangers the privilege of at
tending you." It was a womanly letter
\u25a0âthe letter of a woman mature in heart
and brnlnâ and Claxton pondered a
long, while before putting it aside.
Nf.xt cume a telegram, sent to his
apartments before the telephone had
been Installed. "Please come to-night.
Am blue. Hava wired Minnie stay
home." A very sweet, dependent little
mtssagf, but, of course, not to ba
thought of as the single memento of gn
close a friendship as theirs had been. It
was even preferable to retain the short
note which he hud always uscrlbt-d to

tinction of bolng tho highest point In

hills extending from Tnmalpala t<Â»
Mount Diablo. Besides those wo are t"
have Telegraph Hill, which overlooks
the bay and the wharves and gives the
stranger some little idea of our neigh
boring bay cities.
My motto Is "Whatever you do, do It
well," and I believe In living up to It
as best I can. So I say, in making
parks, make them aa well and 03 prac
tical as possible in order that they
may last and give pleasure to those
who are to come after us. It in foolish
to sink money where It will yield rut
profitable returns and certainly it la
worse than foolish to spend money
where it will do you nor me nor any ono
else no good. So i say spend the money,
â¢where' It will make the greatest num
ber of people happy and In order to do
this you will have to spend it where
the greatest number will be able to
take daily advantage of its benefits.
BY .WILLIS POLK.
At the present time it would not
perhaps be advisable to go into
park wouldn't be a park without some
shrubbery and trrow, but the- ndvdn
tages of a good, health y playground
bo far exceed those of a show place
that there is no comparison, especially
whon the city is trying: to accommo
date the rapidly increasing population.
The proposod hilltop parks are quite
another matter and, n." I said before,
each piece of ground invented In must
be treated according to ita purpose, to
its local ion -and to its plr.e. Twin Peaks,
for instance, should 'be left In their
natural state and "under no circum
stances would I advise disturbing their
natural outlines. Not because they are
particularly beautifui, but for the sim
ple reason that the peaks are charac
teristic and they are a landmark that
should pass on â¢ to posterity In pretty
much the same condition as we found
them. .Terraces and artificial trim
mings would be sadly out of place ac
cording to my notion and it would re
<iulre a large sum of money to re
mako acre upon acre and a. larger sum
to keep them in proper condition.
Heretofore there has not been very
much use thinking or planning about
these hilltop surroundings which
cents, nnd for the same numWr of pon
nlea he may plunge into miniature val
leys and foothills and forgot for the
time being that there are such unpleas
ant and ncrve-raeklng things as fin
ance, commerce, and Industry. In fact,
for the time being he oon forget that
there is anything but blue sky, brown
earth and green, trees, and they are
good, healthy things to think about.
Unfortunately San Francisco pos
sesses far 100 few parks and recreation
grounds considering Its population, for
It Is never too hot in' summer or too
cold in winter to keep people housed
up, and the flowers accommodate us by
blooming 'and doing their best the year
round.
By this I do not mean that my Idea
of a park is a beautiful lawn, terraced,
here and there and filled with profu-
Bions; of flowers. Such grounds are
templing and afo all right . in their
place, but each piece of ground should
first of all- preserve its own character
istics at all costs.

"I think a park laid down on pimple
plans the bfst. Make it something
practical, whore people can really en-
Joy themselves, where the elders may Hit
on rustic benches nnd onjoy the fresh
air and Rtirinhtno, while the children can
play Barnes or sail boats without fear
of banning rare plants or flowers." .r. r \ v
Arthur Mathcwit, dean of the Hop
kins Art Institute, . favored a simple
plan of laying out the park, lie said:
"I think we should have more parka
than we haveâ not pretentious plats,
but one and two block narks, where
people could go and sit around and en
joy the air and sunshine unhindered by
Iho fear of harming rare, pi ants and
ilowers."
Ada Homer Shawhan also thought
the mission Idea would be more in
keeping with the locality, as dld.li.-P.

a band stand. There should be music
in the park.",.
â¢v ilh fcjlly ideas. Ni.t
because. Â«c difj not provida thorn with
extensive parks, but because we erect
ed or permitted Ihe erection ot monu
ments ...r no utility and of doubtful
beauty. Indeed, il will be a matter of
some surprise if posterity fails to lay
violent handa upon smiio of our proud
cat monuments exactly as wo ourselves
in this generation have laid violent
hands upon ihe i.ionumontii of pioneer
days. It is barely possible that while a

our municipal authorities permitted tho

ity wiil rise, en masse, to remoVH the

All these things ponfiiKo us and it
may not he ]>tnin that our duty de
mands that we buy and lay out enough
parks for a groat city of the two mil

and prosper in this irtost favuted of

Mr..no.nnetl, who is Architect Burn
ham's assistant and who is at present
surveying .San Francisco from a. perch
on Twin Peaks, said:
VJt is a singular thing that there
should be such a scarcity of parks in
San Francisco when you have here a
1 sample, nm.<-t of our large <Hi- K f un
doubtedly possess loss park land than
any of the larger European cltfea. Uui
I>p this n.<i it may, Ihe broaO fact la
plain that cities with large park n,-.r,
nro iliatlnguiuhcd c-lthn.
Of course the great parka of France,
especially Uiojie i>r ihe city of Paris,
were originally private gardens. The
Luxembourg gardens, the Tullorles gir
dens, th.Â» Hwia do lloulogne, and the
great and famous gardens of the palace
at Versailles were first of all private
gardens. The parks of Home, nuch ns
I the Horghesi pardons. tlu> Plnclan HIM
nnd others,' were founded In a similar
manner. Home, however, has very few
parks, strictly speaking.
Kan Francisco would, perhaps, bi
benefited morn than any other city by
the establishment of a system of hill
top parks. Although tho city, to-day
is one of tho most beautiful cities in
the world, we are making plans fur its
Improvement' under the auspices of tn-j
Society for the Improvement nnd
Adornment of San Franciscoâ which
plans, by tho way, will be futile If we
do not preserve the hilltops. The city
la probably more beautiful now than It
ever will be. no matter what plans are

Â£"T> HE sunshine had brought out
] the butterflies. They seemed as
i bits of the golden day. flutter-
I Ing low above the earth. The
: : \u25a0\u25a0-..:\u25a0 weatlier had been cold and
stormy. On the hillsides the calves
had moaned for spring and out in the
woods the hogs had rooted up the cold
earth, looking for a warm bed; but
now the sun had come back again and
the violet, timid lest the frost might
bite it, peeped blue-eyed from behind
a, brown leaf lodged against a bush.
They were sitting In front of the wag
on-maker's shop, the wise men of the
neighborhood. They had told their
old jokes. They had laughed at the
things that happened in their boy
hood. And now they must depend
upon immediate observation.
"Yander goes somebody a ridin*
over the county road," said old man
Carter, wagon-maker, coffin-maker
and burier of the dead. "I believe it's
Dock Miller."
Every man got up, looked and sat
down again. They all of them agreed
that it was Dock Miller. Moreover,
they knew that there was distress in
some one's family, for Miller was a
horse doctor. A horse doctor expects
to be called "dock." But the "folks"
doctor resents it as a disrespectful fa
miliarity. He has more of education,
perhaps, than the horse doctor, but he
is not expected to possess so much of
native shrewdness. Therefore what
he may chance to remark upon the
ordinary affairs of life does not carry
the horse doctor weight.
"Jucklin." said Brizintine, "Dock
Miller makes a good deal of money,
don't he?"
"Don't know as to that." Limuel re
plied. "But I believe that a man is
quicker to pay a horse doctor bill than
a folks' doctor bill. I don't know why
it Is true, but true it is. Now thsre was
old Dabney Stillman. The family
doctor used to sue him about every
two years and then had to comprom
ise on corn and fodder. But he always
paid his horse doctor bills. Had no
children â just a wife, and as women
were rather plentiful and horses scarce
out his way â why, I reckon he thought
he could get a wife cheaper than, a
horse. 'Shakespeare said 'put not your
faith in a horse's health,' and I reckon
this principle must be sorter inherent
in human nature, for no man can
count on how long his horse is goin'
to be with him. Can't tell as to a
human bein's health, either; but some
how the average farmer ain't so much
concerned in him. We pray for the
recovery of our friends, but a man
looks foolish if he's caught prayin' for
a horse to get well. That brings up
Buck Goodall. I was passin' along
through his woods one day and I heard \u25a0
him talkln* in a mumblin' sort^of :\vay,
and I didn't quite gather what he. was
about until it broke upon me that jhe
was a talkin' to the Lord.- I sat down
on a stump and waited for him to" get
through! as I had a little business with
him. And pretty soon I; discovered
that he was a prayin'.for. his old^'gray
mare to get well. I snickered like,' and-
Buck he jumped 'up and .turn
ed on me. 'Look here,' .".says r . I,
'ain't a man got a right to sneeze?'
But I couldn't put it off that. way.)' He
swore that I had sneaked ; up ;there to
listen and to make fun of liim;;and I :
wish I may die dead if ,1 c didn't 'have
to knock him .down to make-him under- y.
stand that I - didn't : mean' any : *harrn.;:
'Horse doctors are .queer" characters,''
he added, dismissing Buck from his.
mind. ." :- '.*";. \ \u25a0 ."..:
" "They don't always tell the truth,',
remarked the wagon-maker..
"Well," Lini replied, "they don't al- '
ways know the. truth. They are. not
real ' horse lovers, you know. They.
don't look for perfections, but for, ills.
When we see. a horse a-ebmin' we look
for v his graces, the way he carries his
head, his manner of puttin' down his;
feet; but the horse doctor is searchin'
for disease. His art, lies in disteniDer. ;
If he cares for his profession he must,
think more of disease than of health. :
One argues* his, uselessness and "3 the
other" makes him necessary. And after
a while he'- looks at Hhe 'whole ; world
as if it were a sick horse. : The da~y is]
never perfect. . It's got a blind tooth.
All nature has the , glanders. The
folks' doctor is more or less compelled
to be good-humored; and inclined .to
joke, for a part of his skill is thus;ex
erted and "expressed. ' But a horse dpe-,
tor may joke all he- pleases "with^the
master and it won't help- the horse.
He's got to get right; down to' cold
facts, and cold facts rarely -warm up .<
with good humor. With , all. oChis use
fulness the horse doesn't, express .very
much. He takes the .world
much as he finds it. He never laughs!
as a dogr does. That's the reas6h"-?-he\
doesn't live long for his ; size. \u25a0 . .You ;
can't exactly tell whether -he's glad tor
see you or wants' to kick. vox -And;
sometimes when you have Â£ been'vkind
to him ten years he reaches
and bites a piece out of your! y^arm."
I_don*t know of a thing that I wouldn't"
rather be bitten by than a ho.rse, un
less it's a hog. A horse has a vicious
twist to his bite. He bites as if he
never expects another \u25a0 opportunity;
He doesn't give c-ut any sign that he's
goin' to bite, either. He stands, slow
ly winkin' his eyeâ shuts them,, opens
them , and bites. A mule bites pretty
bad, but lie's quicker than ahorse
and it's sooner over with. 'And again,
you don't mind killin' a mule as much
as you do a horse. It is not unusual
for the bite of a horse to change a
man's disposition for life. Maybe that's
the reason the average horse doctor
is' so. melancholy. " 'lt's 1 no easy.imatter ;
to' give: ai horse medicine, either.>j And

"She is * one -of â¢ those unfortunate

a struggle over the present. -"This per

something in plush albums 'with
celluloid, decorations or a silver^ piece
with impossible colored : glass ; lining.",
Now, he was wondering whether,' in all
the shops, they could find anything
which was - delicate enough ; to please

I \ as he recalled his mother's
I I words, "No good will come of
mS your starting: In the business
as a common employe. Your father
should take you in as a member of the
firm."
That Teas what she had said when,
fresh ffrom the trip abroad, which had
followed his last year at college, Tom
Hardey had started in his father's pub
lishing house as a clerk in the stock
room. Mr. Hardey had two objects in
â¢view in making Tom start at the bot
tom of the ladder. He wanted him to
know the business, and he wanted him
to know people with whom he was to
work for the flrst few years and over
whom he would be placed In the years
to come. As for Tom himself, he didn't
give a rap where he started. While he
didn't inherit all of his father's sociolo
gical theories, he did take a mighty
pride in the business his father 'had
built up, and he meant to do his part in
keeping the family name to the fore in
the business world. But he had also
a keen, sense of humor, and that was
why he chuckled when he pictured the
dismay of his mother on learning that
he had been requested to act on the
committee selected to buy a wedding
present for the bookkeeper.
One of the stenographers had asked
Tom to act on the committee. * She
was .watching: him now in some anx

I had the felicity of spending a .

in an earnest, from-the-consclerice-un
dert&ken way to my entertainment and
which he crowned with the bestowal
cf a bouquet of roses â a most splendid
bouquet, as big and as solid as a head
of cabbage. For an hour he had kept
It hidden behind his broad back, shift
ing it from the one hand to the other

politely refrained from discovering:,
yea, even from suspecting It.
At last â at the psychological moment
which I feared would pass unknown
Ilk* the chips in the nightâ he standing
on the gangplank and I on the tall
end of the ferry-boat â it was at Val
lejoâand .the breach widening be
tween us, he agitatedly burst, like a
repeating rifle, into a succession of ex
plosives:
"Well! â¢ â¢ â¢ Good-by! â¢ â¢ â¢
and take this!" planting in my
outstretched arms the cabâ no, the
roses.
Flowers have come my way in
many ways and various, and always to
the Joy of my heartâ but none that
have stirred such Bwift delight-
Still â It was not the bouquet that
made my day memorable. -
It was a confidence he made me in
B. moment of self-contemplation.
"I guess." said he, turning the cud of
thought deliberately, bovinely as Is his
wont, with an cver-lncreasinjr wonder
and satisfaction at finding himself mas
ter of the process? "I guess I'm the re
ligiousest fighter there is!"
Somehow â I don't know why â I had
never thought of Sharkey in that light.
It Â«as a mental flashlight, and it
aroused an appetite that knows no
palling.
The poet wails for "the power to see

*Pish! Tush!
That is all very well, as far as It
goes, and xve may profit by it, but
there's more of revelation â and enter
tainment â in seeing another as he sees

and count no labor vain to lift the lid
and get a glimpse into the human in

In the case cf James Britt, champion
lightweight of the worldâ
We sat tete-a-tete in a snug, seclud
ed room of the Olympic Club, by ap
pointment, for a heart-to-heart talk,
and spent a futile hour in widening the
distance between us.
He sat facing me, groomed to sleek,
pink freshness, trim, clean-cut, dapper,
his blue eves roving over me Inquir
-sgrly, searching, I'm sure, for the note
book and pencil that distinguishes, the
"lady Journalist" of the drama and the
novel.
He gave me with the most obliging
good nature a "talk for publication" â
omitted here^aying In it all the things
he thought* a fighter, a champion,
cught to say for the honor of his pro
fession and the gratification and credit
of his publicâ neat fallacies and pat
platitudes that might look well in print
â but won't.
I sat with my hands In my lap, al
though I felt like wringing them in
despair at the Elusiveness of the Real,
as they put it in the circles of the
eoulful. Through that futile hour,
like Mia Marlowe's Ophelia of the
night before, was "I of ladies most
deject and wretched" â I feared the lid
vbi riveted down.
The fighter, I gather, has his public
to consider end conciliate, to win to
him. Just as much as has the actress
who prepares a gown and manner and
private character for the especial dis
covery of the Interviewer who purveys
her to the reading world; and the
fighter in consequence saya not what
he has to say, but what he thinks he
ought to say.
At least it was so with James Britt,
champion lightweight of the world â
for a time.
â¢ He expatiated with exceeding ami
ability on the quite wrong conception
of prize fighting, on its really elevat
ing effect on mankind, mixing sophis
try end fact with much ingenuity and
little convincingness, for while I lis
tened with ears end attitude my mind's
eye was occupied with a clergyman of
simple virtue and good intention' who
was so far beguiled into playing Park
hurst to San Francisco as to attend a
fight â so that he might denounce it
understandlngly. It is told that in
the crucial round the man of God
stood upon his chair and yelled "Soak
him! Fitz! Soak him again!" illus-
tratlngr advice by action, and the only
thl!!& that saved his reputation was
the prompt measure of his friends,
who pulled h^s legs from under him
while the several thousand other spec
tators were similarly helping the best
man to win. Ths clergyman. I remem
bered, never denounced prize fighting
from tÂ£e pulpit, but' -with chasteried
spirit and in deep humility, he being
above all an honest man, wrote a ser
mon, on the wisdom of searching one's
own soul for unre,generacy.
. "I'd rather be Jimmy Britt the
Fighter standing there ; in that ring,
the best in my line in the world.
\u25a0 "I never for a ; moment thought ; I
wasn't groins' to win.: I felt sure of
myself from first to last. I always do;
but when. the thing was settled, :Â» when
it was at an end; when at last I â¢ had
the decision, I wouldn't have ; changed

"Yes," with a big laugh and a chest

Eneer and turn us my nose at some
other fellow and say, 'Oh, he's nothing
but a prizefighter,' but nobody would
pay any attention to me if I did. I
wouldn't count, and what I said ,or
thought wouldn't count, except in my
own little circle of "acquaintances, who
\u25a0wouldn't count on their own account

I remembered also, as Champion

who speaks by rote. of the benefits

fighting, a scene on the Doncasiar race
courso i:i England, on the sreatest day
and th* greatest race of ..he year, the
day or the St. Leger, which ranks with,
indeed, caps the Derby. All England
ell the England of wealth and fashion,
and pleasure, of Burkes,: of the so
ciety and the sporting columns was
there, and Just before the great face was
to.be run, when all minds were turned
to -that event, the news was ticked into
the press-Btand that Corbett \u25a0.\u25a0 was
.champion of the fighting world, that
Sullivan was shorn of his honors. Like
a tongue of flame across dry grass . the
news swept . through the tremendous
crowd, ah eager murmur of excitement
rising, and Lord Marcus \u25a0 Bereslord,
who was runnrag the favorite in the
' big race of the day, forgetting for the
moment his own and the sporting in
terest, came : straight to Colonel Tom
Ochiltree arid me, who were of the few
Americans . there, to tell us the news
that was being, chalked on the board.
"Think of it." his voice thick with
feeling and; his eyes afire, Jarred out
of his British and his class composure,
"think of old John L. getting" 'upon his

snuggled under arms, stood there
for hours sto read the : bulletinsâ Just
the builetlris-7-of what two stripped
men were doing in a little roped quad

I saw, too, in my mind's eye once

facing me was fighting for his. right, to
stay on the top of the heap, l arid-how

"Now, . take that pink tea at Bar
Harbor, where Tommy Ryan and his

respect, no matter what difference
there , Is in fortune and education and
cultureâ the factory girl, the society
girl, the rich girl and the poor one, ths
educated girl and the ignorant girl.
I'm not up on history, but I think this
trait they all have dates back 'to "ths
time when force and strength counted
for everything, when each man took
what he could. Of course, every wom
an admired that man most who 'could
take the most, who was ths , strongest !

has lasted, away down deep in every

.That such a philosopher on Ths Sex.

opinions on matrimony is not surpris

"Of course," he interposed against
his own optimism, "a fighter's got to
be able to stand the flattery, the adu

that sort of thing. He has to be able to

That doesn't make it any the less

he gathers the fruits of his labors. .

does comeâ l'm not looking for it â Tin I
not even thinking that it's possibleâ l
yet -awhile: but It will have to coma,
some day, and then I shall settle down
to quiet respectabilityâ if it Isn't re
spectable to be a fighter â and I'll hava
something to settle with."
The champion of the world â In his
class â has a philosophy of his own
when it comes to Lovely Women and
the. Fighter.*
"It'a funny," he says, "but I've, no
ticed," with Just the faintest smile of
satisfaction, "that women are., ths
keenestâ as keen, anyway, as men â to
see a fighter, that theyâ they like 'em.
\u25a0world: there's nothing left* for Â»â¢ to
do now to make good my claim, and
I might have been a struggling; , law
yer "sitting- around waiting for a case
and hot - amounting to anything until
middle ' agel Or I might * have been a
second or third rate bookkeeper.
. "It has given me friendsâ maybe they*,
are only fair-weather friends, but
every human being likes to hays
friends.
'"It has given me better health, and
â some people may laugh to hear a
fighter say _ thisâ It has made a better
man -of me all around. I'm better na
tured, better informed, broader than I
would have' been if I hadn't been a
fighter.' A fighter has to be what you
call a 'good mixer* to get alongâ he's
in a bigger world than If he were earn
ing his living in a private, narrow way.
"Well, j here I am. young and strong
, and healthy. I've got everything that
most men struggle for, and I've got it
early enough, while I have the capacity
to enjoy it. If I'd been a lawyer In
stead,* I would have had to wait -for all
these things â for the money until I was
too old to enjoy It, for fame until I got â¢
sour trying for itâ and perhaps I would
have lost my friends trying to get ths
other things, bo â -
"Well, you can see for yourself what
fighting has done for ME." J Â»
He didn't say It boastfullyâ neither
with the pose of modesty, nor that of.
braggadocio â but quite simply .Trankly.
openly, honestly, giving merely 'natural
expressions to natural feelings, talking
of himself as he sees himself.

of thoughtful men as the solution of a

Mrs. James Brown Potter's gown in
her r>!ay in London during the last sea
son was made of yellow crops and was
called "Dawning Love." It may be hard
perhaps for our practical American
taste to fully understand thi3 "rafine
ir.ent of the fine," but London society
has taken the craze and the society
women must neve at Ici3t one "emo
tional gown" with a name to it. J\'"^
Of course, we all understand that
thcie must be a practical side to ail
thisâ there must b^ measurements, fit
tings ar.d tryincs co without number.
But the house in Hanover square . is
prepared 'cr all these sordid details.
There are dressmakers, seamstresses,
maids nnd fittinc-roorns there. The
fitting-roorm are daintily hung in rose
pink, lighted by soft and ~ becoming
lights and provided 'With mirrors and
cfceval classes, -to that no woman can
bear to forego the treasure that, is at
her hand. I.ady Gordon, it is said, is
practical and the profits arc, large, and
emotional gown 3 are not sold
gether on emotional -â¢ princi nles. The
worldly emotions are said be well pro
vided for as well.
models must learn a dignified yet
graceful carriage and a style of walk
that should display the gowns, in all
their beauty. The head should bt
proudly erect, \u25a0- the shoulders hieh
("beckoning shoulders." as Mrs. Pat
Campbell calls them) and the upper
part of the body must incline forward.
It is now known as the "Piccadilly
walk," and Lady Gordon is its sponsor.
After the fulfilling of all these reauire
ments and after mastering all these
accomplishments, tho models are ar
rayed in these beautiful creations of
dressmakers' art, and the gowns are'
then appropriately named and are ;
ready for inspection. Fancy a gown
called "Dawning Love." or "The
Stifled Sigh." or "The Lively ShcPr
herders," or Â«The Desire to Please."
But when London's - best and eavest
came nominally to tea. but really to
view these models of ait. it must have
been a function difllcult of description.
A grand orchestra in front of the stare \u25a0
furnished appropriate music and as
different mot'fs were rendered one
by one Lady Gordon's models appeared
upon. the stage. Firtt was .seen a.
breaktast sown, or. as the English
call it, a "coffee coat." -which was a
wonderful negligee worn over a law
petticoat, to the soft and somewhat
pensive notes of a subdued orchestral
accompaniment. The next musical
motif is a lively scherzo, v. hen the
models reappear upon the stage
gowned for a walk in Hyde Patk.
Other gbwns were then displayed in
their turn, but the dinner gown was
the chief attraction, the conn which
was named after the emotion which
it was supposed would be called uu by
it.
THERE is nothing new under the
sun, not even the "Emotional
gown." London's latest fad. Al
though ostensibly the invention
of Lady Duff Gordon, who
named it, the gown is Dut another in
stance of the revolving cycles of fash
ion, as it made an appearance even
more spectacular than it does now a
jrood deal more than 100 years ago, in
the days of Marie Antoinette, leader of
the fashions of her time. It was one of
her gowns that Horace Walpole, the
eminent author, wit and statesman, de
ecribed as a "dress of silver tissue,
trimmed with pink blossoms of olean
der: pleasantly refreshing to the emo
tions."
It must have been a beautiful crea
tion and no doubt had a name to cor
respond to the emotion it excited, did
the historian but record it. It is not
then to be wondered at that an ar
tistic, emotional woman like Lady Duff
Gordon, a leader in the fashionable
\u25a0world, should try to prcduce an effect
in the matter of dress that should be
ccw, striking, artistic and luxurious â
and the result is the reign of the "emo
tional gown." Her creed is that every
line and fold and the color of one's
drees should portray an emotion. This
may seem tv be a refinement too
subtle for every day use, but it has a
meaning to the Lady Duff Gordon and
her kind that at all events they think
they believe in. There is certainly
tome basis for it. slight as it may
seem, for we all know that colors have
a significance and meaning of their
own and convey the corresponding
emotion. White, of course, signifies
purity, and black ecrrow, or sometimes
conspiracy. Spenser in the "Faerie
Queene" m?kes white mean faith or
constancy, v. hile blue is hope' and-yel
low is charity. So my Lady Duff Gor
don has a basis to bui.a on and has
just begun to make h^r Idcn'.s real.
Her imposing mansion in Hanover
squaic. formerly the abode of a high
English ecclesiastic, has been remod
eled after her own plans and c-no very
large room is devoted to thr r.oble ait
of dress. At one end of this room is
a stase, embellished with beautiful
hangings; and surrounded by la:ge
palms and ferns.
The furniture is, of course, decant
arid tasteful, the floor of a beautiful
woud, highly polished, and the- lights
Â£.ro s-j artistically placed as to evoke
beauty into the plainest fc Â» lures. The
effect, the glamour of the room cannot
but raise enthusiasm into emotion. A
cor.gTefs of the most famous dress
makers of London and Paris was con
vened for the purpose- of creating not
fashions, but actual new and beautiful
creations. Models must be found who
vould combine symmetry of form with
grace iir.d Etyle, and when four.d the
One of the details that Lady Gordon
insists upon is a very high corset, for
which she has her own special pattern.:
It is a very straight frontand Is much
too high to suit the American taste. In
debutante dresses she is said to display
wonderful skill and taste. She always
insists that these gowns must be white
and lined \yith soft china silk, so as to
make no rustle, and they must be very
clinging. On the other hand, when she
is composing gowns for married wom
en and widows, j especially the/ latter,
she shows a trace of the - l world, 'the
flesh and the: devil., which is a part of
her character and - from ."which â¢ she, of
course, prays to be delivered// ;''*(:
Miss Margaret Ansr'in,- that most;
charming actress, showed me how the/,
models for Lucile (as/ Lady Gordon is*
frequently called) we.remadgf to- walk." .
A "'most extraordinary.: gait it is: The
body is bent forward, and the shoul
ders, heave up and down, actually, as
Miss Anglin said, with the rhythm
of the music. . At a bar masque
this year in this city we were treated!*
to a sight of an "emotional gown,"'
perhaps the only one that - has ever
been seen here. . It was probably not
bought of Lady Gordon, but it was
sufficiently in- her style to entitle.it to
be shown at any of Tier functions. -The
gown portrayed "mysticism": and was
called "The Sorceress." That it was
handsome and appropriate goes-with
out saying.
The picture of Miss Anslin is . one'
wlikh was taken of her in an emo
tional sown, the name of whlqhV^lss
"The vale of tears," and it was chosen
by Miss. Anglin .for her 'dress -in the
third act of "Camille." Remember
iiiST the play and the exciting emotions
o/ that third/act, one can appreciate
rtr.d understand ""Miss' Anglin's > Idea,
which is certainly a. poetic. one. -
We have all- seen -the poster which
portrays Miss Anglln \u25a0in her .little
brown dress, and hat , and \u25a0.'-'\u25a0" thereby.;
hangs a tale." When Miss Anglin
called upon Lucile to select ,-v gown
and paw. thero some of . theso brown
dresses she was greatly .pleased with
them and ordered ot>3 "for. 'herself/ Bu;
Lady "Gordon said, with a tilt of her
eyebrows. "Ah, ~ madarne,, thai 'dress
.is our uniform. and I hardly think you
would care for thatt"--; Miss 'Anglin in
sisted, however, and finally I secured
the gown. This uniform dress is worn
by Lady Gordon and her models and
is as attractive and artistic as their
art can make it. ..Lady Gordon's idea
is, of course, to create 1 emotions by
pleasing the eye : and appealing/ to the
senses and her > success is certainly
assured. , It is perhaps,. /extravagant
and a waste of time to devote so much
thought '\u25a0 and effort, on personal attire,
but still the"reis/something/pieasing"
, in the idea that one's. raiment" should
be becoming and appropriate- to^ the'
occasion.. One. of the pleasures of } life
is to give pleasure to others, no mat
ter direction one's efforts'may
take. And in the matter of clothes
personal; ideas are generally .-y-. much
more effective" than merely ' technical (
and professional assistance. " -
" - It is quite possible for every woman
to form her own ideas of what effect
she may desire to produce and -with a
little thought" as to her, own' emotions
she may.be able to design something
far superior* to the ordinary garb from ;
the -dressmaker. ' Bestowing name ,
upon a'gown will often have an;.eff^ct ,

soft, gentle appearance. which eertairi-|:c'
ly seems to; be a great improvement* /
over ..the ordinary heavy and 'careless
."motions of some women. \u25a0SVS V .' r

CARE OF PERSPIRING ;.FEET
(Sensitive).âTo be afflicted with of
fensivelyipersplring feet Is to be ren
dered -perfectly miserable, and I do
not wonder i you are sensitive ; over. it.
It is a difficult trouble to wholly over
come,; but much can be done to- relieve
. 1 1 : and at a trifling cost. Nervousne&a.
and general debility are frequently th**;
causes of ordinary forms of too copious*
perspiration; in* which- case It 'â¢ will
cease gradually : as the health* im
proves. On the other hand, this trou
ble seems to be . constitutional with
some people; and nothing but exauf
slte; care of the . person will alleviate;
it... If you had written more clearly"
of i*ho w long duration and the exact*
\u25a0 nature . of your trouble 1 could have
"idvlsed you more Intelligently. In any
case; ho wevjer, take the r-irery best care
of your, health and, never be persuaded
to resort to strong perfumes in an en
deavor v to : conceal offensive odors, >for
It only makes a bad matter worse.
Rely upon , dainty foot baths ? and the,
. frequent changing of - hosiery " and
Bhoes to obtain relief. ' Before retiring
prepare; a, warm foot i bath and after
allowing \u25a0-. the feet _-, to â¢ remaln : in the
water, for ten minutes wash, them.thor?
oughly with soap, dry and rub. the soles
and the'ankles, where the largest Â©ores
are located." with ' a decoction of white
oak r bark: . The use â¢of thia astringent
bath' is invaluable in? moderating- the
flow of perspiration.. To make .the de-r
coction^ place one ounce of white oak
;bark to one and a half pints ot bolllnff
water and! simmer very slowly for two
*or three hours; cool, strain . and": addT
; four , ounces "of alcohol. then*botfle .for
use."- The most convenient" mode of ao
plication is to pour out a small' quantity
in a saucer and apply to 'the feet'with ;
. a .velvet f sponge.. Continue this treat

If. however, you Insist upon artificial
ly tinting the hair consult a first class
specialist and. have your Hair dyed by
an experienced person: do not attempe
such operations yourself, using, as you
must, compounds of which you know
nothing. (2) To keep the hair bright
and free from dust without shampoo
ing it frequently have plenty of clean
brushes and use a. fresh one each day.
Brush the hair down to the scalp thor
oughly, but not with sufficient friction
as to Irritate the. scalp. Separate tha
hair and brush out the strands to dis
lodge all particles of dust and dandruff.
Protect the hair from dust .when trav
eling, driving, etc., by wearing a chif
fon veil. â¢ To correct the oily nature of
your little daughter's hair, shampoo.it
every three weeks, addingua; quarter of
a teaspoonful of refined borax or a few
drops, of ammonia, to the basin, of
water. Either Castile or liquid green
Foap is excellent for a shampoo. '\u25a0'\u25a0
NATURE VS. DTE (Forty).â Hair
bleaches and dyes " cannot be recom
mended, for I consider both injurious to*
the: scalp as well as to the health gen
erally. Dyes . are really never perma
nent and often cause the color of the
hair- to streak and thus force., the
continuance ot the dye. Bleaches ut-~
terly destroy the natural pigment of
the hair and it will never return to !ta
original color. Why- not be content:
with -the gift of nature, as you say.
your hair is abundant and only a trifle.

[ IMPROVING CHEERLESS ROOM 3
(Marion). â (1) A room with a northern
exposure that is more or less cheerless
may be made more attractive by
changing the furnishings. Remove tha
blue and white carpet and white enam
eled bedroom suit. Have the walls dons
over in a paper of a warm cream tint,
with garlands of olive and gilt and a
touch of red in the border. Such paper
need not bo expensive. Cover the glar
ing blue woodwork with a coat of
cream white -paint and shade the .elec
tric lights -or the lamps with rich red
silk or, crepe paper. Cover the floor
with a carpet in shades of olive, tan
cream and rich red and add a bedroom,
suit in golden oak. Over the shades,
which should be of deep, cream, nan?
curtains of filmy white lace. Place: a
pretty plant In the side window and a
few books and magazines on a small
table. A room may be furnished as de
scribed at a low cost, or more expen
sively by having a better quality of
furnishings, yet keeping close to the
tones suggested. (2) To improve a
couch which i 3 worn ..shabby, buy a.
couch cover in shades of color which ,
will harmonize with the furnishings Jof
the room and pile it" with' bright pil
lows in* growing red, olive, cream,' etc 5 .
A few good pictures and photographs
prettily framed will add greatly to the
appearance ct the room' and change
your cheerless apartment to a cheerful
one. ;Â»;',

OXCE more cornea the plea for 1
"something: new to eat"; "somÂ»
thiug that will be a change, but
not too expensive," and for
"somcthir.fr that will vary the
family bill of fare."
Now I know perfectly well that this
is the time of year when every one is
kept busy thinking- of something near- 7
and tempting, and just because It really:
is next door to impossible to accomplish'
it without more or less expense nine
tenths of the thoughtful housewives
are calling themselves all the stupid
names in the catalogue.
Now certaintly that doesn't do much
good, for it neither makes them stupids
r.or does it place new dishes before
their lords and masters. It only suc
ceeds In upsetting the family and
themselves and in. making every meal
a disappointment, for no matter how
delicately it may be cooked or how
daintily it may be served, they were
fondly hoping for something new and
startling and. as a consequence, feel
abused and neglected when it is not
forthcoming.
Unfortunately, the price of fresh veg
etables seems to increase every year, so
that greens are not always available,
and it is difficult to find a good substi
tute that is cheaper and that contains
the same amount of nutriment. Yet it
can be done if you try hard enough.
For instance, no one would dream of
omitting potatoes from a moal. yet they
are cooked day after day and some
times tri-daily in just exactly three
waysâ boiled, baked and fried. Now, to
begin with, f-Jnce rich and poor alike
must have them, a change may be in
troduced right here. Look at the ways
"this necessity of -life," as it is called,
may be mysteriously cooked and prof
fered at different times. First, there
is potato soup, potatoes with onions,
potatoes with cheese, curried potatoes,
potato salad, potato gems, potato cake,
potato souf ft>. and, as a crowning fin
ish, potato pie.
Now. who on earth could ask for any
greater variety cl q, single vegetable,"-:
'yet how many of you try your hand at
making something new and appetizing
out of t^his ordinary, cvery-day, matter
cf- fact 'necessity?
Besides the potato there is another
cheap article of food that Is rarely \u25a0
\ cooked well or given its proper value,
yet listen to what a careful writer upon
the comparative values of food says:
"Plain boiled rice, rightly cooked, is
actually digested and begins to be as
similated in one hour, while other ce
reals, legumes and meats and - most
vegetables require from three and a
half to* live hours. Rice thus enables a
man to economize fu!l^ 75 per cent of
the time and. energy expended in the
digestion of ordinary food, setting it
free to be used in his daily vocation, in
the pursuit of study or social duties,
and in the. case of invalids and'en
fec-bJÂ«I vitality, adding it to the reserve
force .of the system."
It has been carefully estimated that
rice more than four times the
energy in Irish potatoes, and when the
waste !n preparing potatoes is consid
ered the difference is Increased to six
fold. It ia> scientifically ascertained .
that of the food taken into the human
body one-sixth goes to the replenishing
and upbuilding and five-sixths go to
produce energy. - The value of food is
based upon the amount of energy it
can furnish rather than its capacity
es a mere flesh producer. It is evident
that on this basis . rice stands first
among human foods.
Nearly every one knows to their sor- i
row that boiled rice is very apt to i
be soggy and when it is served in this i
fashion it is neither attractive, whole- i
pome or pleasant, but fortunately this :
is not the fault of the rice, but of the I
cook, and a little practice and patience '.
is all that is needed to make this dish
quite as popular here as it is, in. the
Orient. " <: . , . .
Tsh^ySouthcrn people understand the
knarfkVof.. steaming .it so that each I
kerne* stands out distinct and whole, <
and they understand that the water ,
in which it- Is cooked is a valuable ,
addition to the soup pot. So you. see ',
there are tricks- in all trades, and if .
you only possess tha secret of the J
tricks you .may be able to practically
make something good out of almost .
nothing after all.
With the recipes for cooking rice, '
which, by the way, have been borrowed
from here, there and everywhere, I'm
going to add a few others that may '
help you out of your perplexity - and
that make the family believe" they are
living-en tha fat of the land.-

There is another point upon which
Mrs. Potter is sorely vexed. She dis
likes reference to herself by the press
of the United States as Mrs. "James

that she is not now Mrs. James Brown
Potter. Mrs. .James. Brown rPotter
was Miss May Handy. ,. The London
Mrs. Potter signs herself Cora.Urqu
hart Potter and prefers to be known
as Mrs. Potter, .or as Mrs. Brown-
Potter (hyphenated), which latter
style she uses in her management of
the Savoy Theater. i
LONDON. May 13.â Mrs. Brown-
Potter is disturbed about certain re
ports, ostensibly originating in Lon
don and published in the United States,
and Is emphatic, almost to the point
of anger, in her denials and explana
tions. In her apartments at the Sa
voy Hotel yesterday she conversed
freely about the statement that she
would never return to the United
States because of the influence of her
son-in-law, James A- Stillman, and "his
father's Standard Oil affiliations.
"You may absolutely deny the state
ment that I have said I would not re
turn to the United States," said Mrs.
Potter. "Nor have I entered Into any
agreement with the Standard Oil in
terests for â¢ a monetary or other con
sideration upon this or any other mat
ter. I want, it distinctly understood
that never In my -whole career have I
received one penny . from any ! source
except as the result of my own work.
I am under* obligations to no one in a
business or any other way.. And I will
probably visit America this year."
Mrs. Potter would not \u25a0 discuss tho
social relations between her daugh
ter Fifi's new relatives and herself,
but added: "I â¢ treat all my move
ments solely as business -propositions
and it Is perfectly ridiculous' that- all
these things should be said about me.
I have never compromised with any
one and never will." â¢
LONDON. May 13.â Most of the
prominent American society folk
have returned from their Lenten
country house pilgrimages and
in accordance with their usual
custom will remain In London
for three or four weeks before goinjf to
their favorite places on the Continent
or back Into the country. This year
the London social whirl promises to bt
unusually gay, although few entertain
ments win be announced for another
week or two. Real estate agents report
a greater demand than ever for town
houses for the season. -Among the
Americans who will make special prep
arations for the full enjoyment of the
Beason are Lawrence McCormick,
of Chicago reaper fame, and Mrs. Mc-
Cormlck, who. It will be remembered.

much for society's favors, they, will this
year brancli out rather pronouncedly.
Archie Pell and his wife will also
spend the spring and most of the sum
mer months In London. They have
taken a house In Cork street and will
do considerable entertaining. Archie
made a good deal of money In the
stock market recently, and it seems to
agree with him, as he looked extremely
v.*ell the other evening at the Carlton.
Mrs. Poultney Bigelow has given up
her house at 10 Elm Park Gardens, Lon

The Palais Royal, where Prince Na
poleon installed his bride, had been
the scene , of many intrigues Â«and the
center of much , plotting and counter
plotting since the days of the great
Cardinal, whose crowning extrava
gance the building had been. Riche
lieu left the Palais to his master,
Louis XIII: and Louis' widow, Anne
of Austria, inhabited it until it . be :
came the asylum . of Henrietta Marie
de France, widow of King. Charles I
of England. In' its magnificent rooms
lived the English Queen arid her
youngest, child,,' Princess Henrietta.
Henrietta married the Due d'Orleans,
brother of Louis XIV. The Palais
Royal was the home of the royal pair
and their poor Henrietta saw her
dream -of wedded happiness fade away
like fairy gold. She died there in a
very, few years-â of poison, it was said.
Such were the tragic memories of the
place to - which Prince Napoleon
brought his girl- wife. ;
Princess Clotilde "had been reared
by the good sisters of Santa Chiara to
esteem simple goodness, and piety and
feminine vi rtue above all things. Her
beautiful .home in the old city of
Turin, within sight of the snows of the
Alps, "within sound \u25a0 of.? the rushing
green waters of the s Po, had - ill '\u25a0 pre
pared her for the meretricious gaudl
ness of. Paris; under, the third; empire;
And J she could â¢ not forget \ that Turin
itself had been subjugated' and humili-;
ated by J the uncle : of , her - bridegroom.*
The ' very bridge ; by ,â which she crossed
the river had been \u25a0. built by Napoleon I
with = the \: spoils { of ; the altars 'of \ the
Cathedral ' of ' Turin, the^ terrible Corsi
ca n , having torn \ the ..very crown \ from
the ? brow of : the virgin and \u25a0 the jewels
from â¢ the chalices in> the sacristy" in
his impious disregard for - holy things
and^his greedfor gold: )'\u25a0' ; /,
"If -; the ways â¢ of the 'court of the
Tulleries were distasteful to Princess
Clotilde^she '-\u25a0 herself . wasV in 1 her v turn
distasteful ; to J the imperial : ; pair then,
seated (on Ythei throne i of v The
beautiful 'Empress loved ito see around
her \u25a0 women fes radiant and as frivolous
as : herself; '\u25a0 she t : wished,'- she> said: her.
LONDON, May 13.â 8y the world al
most forgotten, in her old age trying
to bury in good works the memory of
her loveless marriage and the years of
wretchedness â¢ that it brought her,
Princess Clotilde of Savoy is one of the
most pathetic figures in modern \u25a0' his
tory. She inherited the bluest ; strain
of royal blood in Europe and with sor
row and misery she has paid for it.
: When only 16, fresh* from .a convent
school, knowing nothing of the vices
and wickedness that \u25a0, are often asso
ciated with exalted hereditary rank,
she was -married in 1859 to Prince Na
poleon, the son ; of Jerome Btnaparte,'
the youngest brother of the, great
Bonaparte-r-"le petit corporal," whose
ambition drenched Europe in blood and
cost millions of lives. The marriage
was dictated by, purely political con
siderations. The girl was sacrificed be
cause of her pedigree. The battles of
Magenta and Solferino.had been fought
and won; the Austrians had been driv
en back .across \ the Alps;'; the,. . unity
of Italy was fairly in sight and \the
dream of .Victors Emmanuel almost real
peror of /the' French for his assistance'
against , Austria -w as the province of
Savoy, the cradle of Victor Emmanuel's
dynasty and the King's daughter for
his cousin, Prince Napoleon. .
, It is. said that only twice in liis life
were tears known to dim the fierce eyes
of "II Re Galantuomo"â once,- when cm
the field of Levara, his fatherâdefeat
ed, despairing, dyingâ took " the crown
from his brow, and bade, the soldiers
hail Prince Victor .Emmanuel as
King of Sardinia and Savoy;
and again when, after long
interviews with his Minister , Ca
vour. he sent for his child Clo
tilde and told her he had promised her
hand to the most notorious -" viveur,"
the coldest-hearted man of his time,
Jerome Napoleon, the French Emper
or's kinsman . and possible successorâ
a man considerably more than j twice
her age and whom she had never be
held. And thus the motherless girl-
Queen Adelaide had died three years
beforeâ was given to the man ; who
presided over the orgies of the Palais
HoyaL As had happened to Princesses
of her house before, she was ruthlessly
bartered away for value received. She
was sacrificed to the cause "of Italian
unity.
A NEST OF ( INTRIGUE.
His low-priced restaurants increased
even faster than his family, .and every
year sees additions to their number.
In 1597 they were all amalgamated un
der one . companyâ the .British Tea
Table Company, with a capital ofsl,
500,000. The first year's profits of the
concern yielded a dividend of 14 per
cent. Few enterprises' in America pay
that much. Some idea of â¢ the extent
of the business that began .with a per
ambulating coffee stall ! may be gained
from these figures. At: Its eighty -one
houses the annual consumption of fresh
meat amounts to 2,016,000 pounds; of
bacon, - 225,000 pounds; of flour, 1000
tons; of potatoes, ': 1300 tons; of milk,
265,000 gallons, and 4,250,000 eggs.
After learning the lesson of sobriety
at the cost of his situation^he obtained
a situation at a pastry cook's. In 'his
long tramps to and from work he ob
served how great was the need among
casual and other laborers of good and
cheap food. It suggested an opportu
nity for him to become his own mas
ter. He hired a costermonger's barrow
at 25 cents a : week, bought a humble
urn and a few crocks and set out to
earn his fortune as a cheap and per
ambulating caterer in the city road.
He did not even dream then that he
was laying the foundation of a colossal
business.
He was born fifty-eight years ago in
one of the slums of Hoxton. When he
was a little shaver his father died,
leaving his â¢ mother to carry on the
struggle against poverty alone with a
family of " hungry children^ on ; \u25a0
hands.' One" rqonv was* "all she cbul<f af -*
ford, but there she reared her.; brood,
and besides contriving to. feed and
clothe them all she put right notions
into* their heads, 'eo'that ultimately
they all turned out well. What a tough
time they had of it may be inferred
from the fact that at the age of 9 years
"Johnnie" had to start working for a
living. He hired himself out to a pict
ure frame maker for half a crown, or
62 cents, a week. At the age of 18 he
was working for a . builder at the
princely wage of 75 cents a week, with
breakfast thrown in. It was customary
in those days to pay off the hands in
saloonsâ a pernicious practice, to which
the law long ago put a stop. On one of
these occasions young Pearee got
drunk for the first and only time in his
life. It was a case of good coming out
of evil. He lost his job; but he swore
off, and temperance was a great gainer
thereby. , In the four score and one res
taurants under his control , scattered
through London not a drop of intoxi
cating liquor is allowed to be sold.
A VALUABLE LESSON. j
LONDON. May 13.â There is a lesson
for every American boy who has his.
own way to make in the world in the
career of John Pearee, the prince of
London's cheap caterers, whose 1500
employes recently presented him- with
a handsome testimonal. They did this
just to show that they regarded their
boss as their friend, andjt was an ap
propriate tribute to a man who in his
rise from poverty to affluence has al
ways, commanded, the esteem of those
who have worked for him. Tall and
lanky, stoop-shouldered, with features
rather sad in expression and singularly
wistful looking eyes, there is nothing
about John Pearee that suggests the
typical self-made captain of industry.
He would never be picked out of a
crowd as a strikingly successful man
or a particularly brilliant one in any,
respect. He has been sized up wrong
oftener probably "than any pother man
in London.

LONDON, May 13.â As a Kettering

oyster for a customer the other day
ten dull white pearls fell in a shower
on the floor. â¢ â¢
They were about the size of peaa
and one or two are pronounced by
local jewelers to be of excellent qual
ity.
They are probably worth - about
$250. The oysters are deep-sea Aus

of 'pearl oysters are sent annually. \u25a0
The lucky tradesman is exhibiting
the treasure-trove at his shop, and it
is proving a capital advertisement.
He intends to send 'â¢ the pearls to

She had had enough or- the 'game of

A carriage' came to the door and some
one asked who it was for. I said that
I was sending out the cook and house
maid for a drive. Then Miss Hamed
had a great discussion with my brother,
as to the wisdom of the thing. My
brother said: 'Oh, so long as he 'doesn't
go out with them we think it all
right!' "
think the last thing I heard from
Mr. Sothern was his lively apprecia
tion of the privilege of studying arid
acting-- Shakespeare with- Julia Mar
lowe. It was almost the first thing,
too, as we came up to the hotel from
the theater. ,
. "Exactly," bowed the actor, "why
they like :the things." He smiled as he
recalled this: "I remember one day be
fore I was married' Miss Hamed"â Miss
Virginia Harned* is Mrs. L Sothernâ "was
''Why?" Miss, 1 Marlowe laughed.
That the people, the great people,
"like 'Hamlet' just as .well as 'Why
Girls' Leave. Home* was the amusing
dictum of the actor. "My. own servants
do- 1 - 1 have theories about servants," he
interrupted himself with. / 1 interrupted
him to say that as some of his servants
were his father's before' him, Mr. \u25a0 Soth
ern's theories must be in a measure
successful. 7 "But I make 'em -enjoy
themselves, go to; the theaters, and
then I aak themâ":
if that table were so placed that Ro
meo on his way to the window had to
go around it, instead of in a straieht
line past it, the directness of the
scene would be wholly spoiled.' Take
the bolting of the door after the nurse
goes out . in the first scene in Juliet's
room. J have seen that ruined
by a too loud shooting of the bolt.
People don't know what is the matter,
but they feel it, they feel it."
With the coffee Alfred Ayres came
up again, and the all-important ques
tion of reading. Miss Marlowe, asked
Mr. Sothern to show me his copy of
"Merchant of Venice" from which they
have been studying for next season.
From the next' room he brought it. its
every accent marked, in every, small
speech of every smallpart. Two hours
each day Miss' Marlowe, Mrs. Wood
ward and Mr. , Sothern give to the sim
ple elucidating of the 'text. .\ ;'
The rest of the detail is just as care
fully gone over. "Only so," Miss Mar
lowe said, "only when the technique of
the thing is so sure that one can forget
it is one free to express oneself."
They all-laughed at the memory of a
small scribe who had recently "siiped"
for the experience in- one of their- pro
ductions, . That Mr. Sothern ;' had
stopped the rise of the curtain untiTthe
Laertes, stood .two inches more to the
front the' said small scribe had harped
upon as deadly evidence of .Mr. Soth
ern's mechanical tendencies. VT.Vv
Before, .we had talked of the old
prompt books, with -their traditional
stage directions. How in his father's
books hÂ£ had seen ' such leprends as:
"Walk ten steps forward and to th>>
right, count eight and then say. 'My
lord,' "'Mr. Sothern recalled.
"Deadly mechanical ; it seems," Miss
Marlowe had put in thoughtfully.
"But it is on just those little thines
that perfection hangs. Take the scene
in Juliet's room, where Romeo says
good-by to Juilet; There is a table be
tween the lovers and the window. Now.
"A flash of sanity?" ;
"Too many flashes," Mr. Sothern in
sisted.- "What's in her mind is Ham

does she seemto ( have any knowledge
of things about her. She does not
know , Laertes. Why should she know
the King and Queen, the rue and the
daisies?" "
"Were there only any stage direc
tions â " ,
"Ay, if there only were," the actor
regretted.
lieved him mad or sane. But to me his
every line indicates sanity."
That lunatics had always interested
him, Mr. Sothern said then: "One's
company is so largely composed of
them! 1 used to walk out to an asylum
every day with 'Joe* Haworthâ 'poor
Joe'â to study the lunatics," he recall
ed. Interestingly, he studied his Ham
let first with Joseph Haworth. and
curiously never saw- Haworth's own
Hamlet. He was much interested to
learn how well the Haworth character
ization had been 'liked here. Apropos
of lunatics, and as we were on our
way to the elevator, Mr. Sothern told
me how deeply impressed William- Rolf e'
was with Miss Marlowe's mad scene,
particularly .in the flower episode.
"Usually the Ophelia gives daisies and
rue to the Queen and King with every
appearance of sanity," the actor re
minded. "She, knows the flowers and
knows to whom she is giving them.
Moreover she gives the rue. with most
singular, fitness, where rue should be
given. It is impossible that she

the rarely heard Koschafs "Holiday
Scenes in "Karinthia," for soprano and
tenor solos and male voice chorus, and
the Strauss waltzes, which were re
ceived with such enthusiasm at the
last concert. The club will have the
assistance of Mrs. Cora Hall, soprano,
and an orchestra of strings, flute and
clarionet. The instrumental numbers
include a string quartet by Rubinstein
and a movement from a string quartet
by. Raff. Fred. Maurer Jr. will be the
pianist, and the concert will be under
the direction of W. C. Stadtfeld.
The San Francisco Musical Club will
have a programme 'of exceptional in
terest for its musical evening of next
Thursday, with the Hector Berlioz
"Faust." The affair is under the direc
tion of Dr. H. J. Stewart.
The last concerts of the season take
place this week, with the six Ysaye
concerts at the Alhambra Theater, to
be- given on Monday, Tuesday, Wed
nesday, Friday and Sunday evenings
and on the Saturday afternoon, as
chief interest. Besides the brilliant
gifts of the violinist there are other
features that make these concerts
among the most important of a season
perhaps the most brilliant musically in
San Francisco. The presence of an
orchestra makes possible programmes
that are "only most rarely to be heard
here. Many of the most important vio
lin composition will be given at the
flrst concert to-morrow evening, for
example the Bach concerto In E major
(No. 2), with, organ accompaniment,
and the Beethoven concerto In D ma
jor Op. 61." The orchestra is a local
one, ' and has been rehearsing actively
under the direction of Paul Stelndorff
for several weeks. It will be directed
by Jules de Befve, conductor of the
Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra at
Liege.
Though the orchestra Is a. scratch
one â this without any disrespectâ it is
a San Francisco one, and we have seen
many notable things done by such be
fore. There is every reason to expect
the best in this case. Mr. Steindorff
has given much time and energy to
their drilling, and M. de Befve is said
to be a conductor of exceptional gifts.
M. Ysaye needs no advertisement to a
San Francisco audience. He is one of
the greatest players, and if he Is in his,

ask no more. Here are two pro

FINISH OF CONCERT
SEASON THIS WEEK
The beautiful aigrettes known to mll
liners-'as "osprey" plumes do not come
off the bird properly known as the os
prey. This is a large brown and white
fishing hawk, persecuted, indeed, to the
death by the collector of "British sp<*p-
Imens," but not in the cause of fashion,
since It has no remarkable plumage to
excite cupidity.
The plumes sold under this name are
the trousseau of several species of
white heronsâ a wedding garment worn
by both bride and bridegroom, and they
were originally called by the French
name "esprit." Mispronunciation and
the knowledge that there . is : a bird
called osprey have given us the present
title. Of course the objection to their
use is the fact that the birds are killed
in the breeding season, the j young be
ing left to starve; but by keeping the
birds in captivity all this could be
avoided, as they could be, caught and
shorn much easier than sheep.
There are several species of. egrets.
as these white plume-bearing . herons
are called, but one seems'more suitable
than any of the others for artificial
culture. This is the biggest of allâ the
large egret (Herodlaa alba), a bird
found practically all over the world,
for, although some ornithologists di
vide it into two or three species, the
differences are not of any practical inf
portance. It is about as tall as our
common heron, but even more long and
slender in shape, and Its breeding plu
mage is in the form of one thick bunch
of very long plumes growing from its
back.
This species, being able to live la
both hot and temperate climates, would
thriven either here or in, our colonies,
and, being of a size to protect Itself
against any ordinary vermin, has ob
vious advantages as a domestic bird.
It is, moreover, very long lived.
Young birds should be procured to
start with, as old ones would probably
bear captivity with a very bad grace,
like the common heron, which is apt to
refuse food when captured adult. Four
may be found in a nest, and they
might be expected to bear marketable
plumes in T the year after capture.
The best way to keep them would bÂ©
to clip the long quills of one wing and
turn them out in an lnclosure sur
rounded by a six-foot fence of the
coarsest netting, until they get tame,
when they could be allowed to wander
about any available fields, care being
taken at first that they did not stray.
They would do no harm to any sort of
crop, as they are purely animal j feed
ers; In fact, they would be of use in
destroying vermin, as. like our own
heron, they do not confine themselves
to fish. The vicinity of a stream, would,
of course, be desirable, but in the ab
sence of such accommodation a large,
shallow tub kept full of clean water
would be sufficient for them to bathe
In.
Once they were got to breed, some
selection could be attempted in order to
produce birds with the moat abundant
plumes, the most accommodating ap
petites and the best tempers and con
stitutions; in fact, the species could
be thoroughly domesticated, and, of
course, there would be *a profit In sell
ing birds for stock. â London Express.

The other answer Is "Sothern." Ask
ing questions Is Mr. Sothern's chief
amusement, as it Is bis faith. He was
probably born asking "why?" â most of
us wonder later â and in the "Last
Words of Great Actors" one can easily
foresee the Sothern "why?" "'Why*
did you enjoy 'Romeo and Juliet?' "
he asks of his cook, who â but that

Mr. Sotbern, "he got my 50 cents. He
dug out the whole plot, though he did
call Beatrice 'the first fellow* and Hero
the 'other rag!' And I asked him
why "
"Of course, you asked him why!"
this with a full ripple of ripe .laughter,
could only be from Julia Marlowe.
It was from Miss Marlowe, the time
32 p. m., the place Mr. Sothern's room
In the St. Francis, the occasion a
chat about "Hamlet," to which Mr.
Eothern privileged me this week. That
â¢was the only time, what of photograph
ers, rehearsals and other Impinging
business this butterfly of the stage
could give me. After the play on Tues
day night therefore, and over supper,
the one ur.trammeled meal of the day
for the actor folk, we talked. There
was Mrs. Woodward, Miss Marlowe,
Mr. Sothern, the Young Person and
myself. There was "Hamlet" with the
soup. "Hamlet" with the coffee, and
Shakespeare for eauce generally, to the
contentment and pleasure of all. For
there is this about the actor people,
perhaps more than with any other
artist people, their work is their play.
"Of course you asked him why!"
Miss Marlowe laughed.
Mr. Sothern laughed and the talk
drifted to the time of his flrst "Ham
let," five years ago, when he had asked
Alfred Ayres his characteristic question
concerning it.
Mr. Ayres was rather compelled to
attention concerning the "Hamlet."
The famous critic had made a famous
clip concerning one of the Sothern per
formances. He had been to see the
actor in * I The Love Chase." He had .
left the theater before the difficult
scene in which most Wildrakes fall.
Reasoning by analogy he had criticized
the scene as it might, should, or would
have been played â had it been played
at all! Mr. Sothern met him the next
day. It rained and "I got under his
umbrella," recounted the actor, "and
I told him how much impressed I was
with his criticism. 'You're a thought
ful young man,' grunted Ayres. We
splashed along to the Mirror office. He
was writing then for the Mirror and I
told him that I was particularly im
pressed with his criticism of the scene
In question. 'You're a very thought
ful young man,' Ayres grunted. 'Be
cause.' I added, 'I did not play that
scene:' 'By Jove! you don't say so,'
Ayres grunted. Then I told him I
should tell Fiske, his editor, and he
asked me not to. But the joke was too
pood, and tell him I did, with Ayres
in the next room. But he came to' see
my 'Hamlet' and said it was about
the worst he had ever seen. Then I got
him up to my room and made him tell
me why."
"Evidently you thought his opinion
worth while," I remarked.
"Was the noble Dane mad?" Miss
Marlowe teased him, delicious drollery
xn her eyes.
"Yes, would you call him mad. Mr.
Sothern?" Mrs. Woodward leaned for
ward to ask gravely.
"Seriously enough, Mr. Sothern, was
Hamlet mad?" I Inquired, and even the
Young Person giggled.
"But is it not strange." insisted the
actor, "that there should ever have
been any serious doubt as to Hamlet's
sanity? Booth, you know â please don't
inject the obvious comparison â would
never be interviewed about Hamlet.
He would never say whether he be-
;. "Yes, even such things can be."
Sothern put in. "Now, was Hamlet
mad?"
Xeatly pinking a piece of grape
fruit, as it might have been a re
fractory critic, he went on: "My Ham
let characterization has been cata
logued as Danish in character, for in
stance. I assure you that if it is
Danish it is purely accidental. The
period and place are too remote for
local color to have any value. There
was Fechter. He went on In the 'To
be or not to be' scene with a drawn
sword. It was interpreted that he had
intended it to convey that Hamlet
meant to commit suicide. Fechter's'
idea was to show that Hamlet intended
then to kill the King. There are, in
fact, as many Hamlets as people that
see Hamlet."
"There was Miss S â *s edition of
Hamlet," Miss Marlowe reminded.
"That was very interesting," Soth
ern recalled. "There was a 'Hamlet'
built up purely on the theory
of disgraceful relations between
Hamlet and Ophelia. Pah! And
that was the crux of the
whole thing. It was based upon one
line of Hamlet's, where he is 'told to
marry Ophelia. This is the wonderful
way the line was read: 'And shall I
couple â hell!' And Miss S â wanted
me to play it that way," i:\
"Yet there was a whole book based
upon the theory," Mrs. Woodward
threw In.
Mr. Sothern, however, said here
that he found all honest criticism
stimulating, though active antagonism
to his work was for the moment de
pressing. He modestly put it that
when he was younger he did "pretty
well in parts easily achieved, and the
critics were uniformly kind." "It is
much more interesting now," he added,
with the quaint twinkle that some
times lights up his big, blue eyes, "and
it Is much more difficult. In a Ham
let, for example, you confront" a thou
sand prejudices. It makes the day
quite joyous to get up and find a dozen
differing opinions in the papers as to
what you have been trying to do the
night beforeâ eh?"
"You would . have thought so If you
,had seen him and heard him," chuck
led the actor. "He sat with his : eyes
shut, groaning:, grunting, writhing all
the time, throwing- up his hands, and
then ended up by saying it was not
of the slightest use criticizing me.
But he did criticize, and afterward
said there was some slight hope."
"You do not usually pay so much
attention to criticism," I laughed.
Coming up from the theater we had
been discussing doctors' differences.
Mr. Sothern among other things had
slyly reminded me that Peter Robert
son had said that of all Ophelias Miss
Marlowe's was the one to him that
could most credibly become mad. and
that my humble self had said that not
for a moment could I give credence to
this Ophelia's becoming mad, ex
quisitely convincing as her portrayal
of the madness itself Is!

The Australian Government has or
ganized an expedition to explore the
region between Lake Eyre and 'the
boundary cf Queensland. This land
is said to, be one of the worst deserts
in the - world.
Enright is piscatorial adviser to Mr.
Astor also, and earlier in the season,
it may be remembered, he waa charged
by the proprietor of Cliveden with the
introduction of young Irish* salmon
Into the- portion of the Thames which
borders â¢. upon Aster's ' up-river home.
The expert says that Astor*s knowledge
of the peculiarities . of the different
species of fish is almost . eaual, to -his
own. and although he makes no boast
of It Astor can use a rod as J well as
some of the best professionals. The
patience with which he sits on a river
bank all day. with a plain sandwich
for luncheon, would astonish any one
who is acquainted with the absorbing
interest -which he formerly took in
business matters. t

BUCHAREST. May 13.â Roman Cari
aman, a gypsy, of Rimmic Sarat, who
murdered his sweetheart owing to jeal
ousy, was pursued by. gendarmes and
found hiding in an outhouse yester
day.
. The police and a crowd of peasants
were closing in upon the building,
when Cariaman- rushed out and, wield
ing a heavy woodman's ax, hewed right
and left into the crowd.
Two gendarmes and three peasants
were killed and twelve others received
wounds before he cut his way through.
The gypsy reached the open, and,
dropping \u25a0 the ax, ran for the woods,
when he was shot through the heart
by a policeman.

PARIS, May 13.â The clients of a cer

typewritten â¢ letters saying: "The state
of niy affairs forces me to leave Paris
for the present. Please excuse my ac
tion and have no fear. I am going
abroad to recoup my fortunes and shall
return and pay you all."
\u25a0 The result v was a crowd of- anxious
depositors at the bank the next day,
much ' to- the surprise ~ of the banker,
who discovered the letter had been sent
by a| facetious \u25a0 clerk who wanted ,to

No daintier luncheon has been seen
this season than that given last Mon
day by Mrs. Thomas Morffew. The
setting was the Claremont . Coun
try. Club, Piedmont, and thi
big round . table, nearly burled
under" Ceclle Bruner. roies, was
most Inviting, In Its beauty. Thirty
guests were bidden. Including resident*
of. this town and of the pretty suburb*
Among them were:
fiorosls Hall never looked prettier
than with Its boughs of hawthorn in
lavish quantity, thistles, daisies, cory
opsls and yellow shaded candelabra.
The glow was cheerful and golden.
One more meeting closes this season,
the ne-vr officers to take their seats at
the convening of the club September 1
The reception last Thursday to Mrs.
William P. Buckingham, extended by
Cap and Bells upon her retiring from
the presidential chair, was a most
happy and auspicious occasion. Mrs.
Buckingham has been an enthusiastic
worker in the club of her founding;, the
appreciation of which was fully ex
pressed by the members on Thursday.
At the annual election of officers a few
weeks ago Mrs. Squire Varrick Mooney
was elected to the chair and, to -her
lot It fell to extend words of farewell
to her predecessor. A presentation
speech was also in order, which Mrs.
Mooney gracefully delivered with' a
string of pearla, tangible evidence of
the club's regard for Mrs/Buckingham.
Many numbers, embracing varied line*
of music, and reading passed the after
noon pleasurably.
The Eastland-Wagner wedding pro
voked an aftermath of festivity, for
upon the departure of the newly wed
the intimates and congenials of the
bride and groom convened with Mrs.
J. J. Mpore. who entertained delight
fully for a few hours following. In
the gathering were Mra. Eleanor Mar
tin. Mr. and Mrs. John D. Spreckels
Jr , Miss Grace Spreckels, Miss Helen
de Ycung, Miss Constance de Young,
Air. and Mrs. John C. Wilson, Mr.. and
Mrs. Xoble Eaton, Mr. and Mrs. Roth
child. Dr. and Mrs. J. Wilson Shiels,
Mrs. Harry Holbrook, Courtney For 3,
Cyril Tobin. George Lewis and Mr.
anÂ«l Mrs. Postlev.
That was a most, elaborate affair,
the dinner given by Mr. and Mrs. Tim
othy Hopkins last Tuesday at the Pal
ace in honor of Miss Mary Kohl and
E. S. Pillsbury. The appointments
were befitting the occasion and nota
bility of the engagement so recently
announced. The Empire room was
used for the reception of guests and
its lovely appearance was but an in
troductory for the beauty of the Mar
ble room, where dinner w^s served.
American Beauty roses and sweet peas
banked against a gTeen background
was the scheme in the Empire room.
The decoration for the tables, of
which, there were three large round
ones, consisted of a gradation of color
from palest pink to the depths of
crimson, the effect obtained by the
skillful arrangement of sweet peas,
carnations and roses. The scene was
vividly beautiful and one to leave a
lasting impression on the fortunate
observers. Mr. and Mrs. en
teitained fifty-four guests.
at a luncheon at the St. Francis.
The last meeting of the Milton guar
dians considered the experiment with
much interest. No dissatisfaction was
expressed by the members of the
"team." On the "contrary, many of
them seemed to enjoy it.
One of the guardians remarked that
it was an illustration of the aptness of
the cry, "Back to the land!"

"My set!" Is it snobbish, this clas
sification of smart set maids?
It depends upon the contiguous
text. If said in a negative sense, it is
snobbish, as it carries an inference of
superiority, a suggestion of *'I am
better than thou." But where the seg
regation Is made into sets by the yard
stick of personality that's another
matter. This Is the legitimate phase
of the "set" question and, unhappily,
one not often encountered In society.
It is more generally based upon
money and social position, personal
qualities not in the reckoning. And
this is not the quality that makes for
Americanism.
The foundation of the "set" propo
sition begins In school, in high schools
or so-called finishing schools, where i
sororities exist
Sororities breed sets.
Sets breed snobbishness, save where
the classification Is based upon per
sonality or personal achievement.
Then it is justifiable and eminently
fit. It is then the '"natural selection"
of mental and spiritual companion
ship, wholly worthy of the daughters
of a republic.

The lecturer, who is an eloquent
orator, also witty and gifted with the
power of description, held his audi
ence spellbound while he told of the
wonderful scenes his eyes rested upon
while being shown historic buildings,
majestic cathedrals, mountain and
lake scenery, wonderful dykes, great
bridges, quaint structures in out of
the way nooks and the wonders of
Rome and the beauties of the far
famed Alds. His lecture, which was
illustrated with many beautiful stere
opticon views, covered sights and ex
periences in England, Ireland. Scot
land, Wales. Holland, Germany, Italy
and Switzerland and was one of the
most entertaining that has ever been
delivered before members of the Or
der of Red Men.
Many members of the Improved Or
der of Red Men and members of the
Degree of Pocahontas assembled in
Lyric Hall last night for the purpose
of being entertained by Judge A. M.
Cunning of Hollister, the great senior
sagamore of the order, who delivered
an illustrated lecture of his personal
observations and experiences during
a tour of the greater portion of Eu
rope a short time ago.

By painstaking argument Father
Wyman aims to show, step by step,
that there can be in religion as much
certainty as In anything pertaining to
life and existence. ..His articles on
papal infallibility and the reformation
are particularly interesting and in
structive. Other chapters in the work
by which those who cannot spare the
time to peruse the entire book should
be greatly benefited are "The Inspired
Word," "Prophecies and Their Fulfill
ment," "The Divlnity-of Christ,"- "The
Greek â¢ Schism" and "Pope and Coun
cils." : -
While Father Wyman has distin
guished himself as far as the public is
concerned * by ; the prominent part he
has taken in church work in New York
and San Francisco, he is more, noted
among the teachers of the | Gospel for
hl6 remarkable historical and scientific
knowledge of his creed and of the
Scriptures. He is a man of the finest
education, and the attainments thus
acquired, combined with a, naturally
logical mentality, make his book worth
the careful perusal of any one who is
interested* in the theory of an after-life.
Much interest has been aroused in
ecclesiastical circles recently by the
appearance of a religious work entitled
"Certainty in Religion," which is pub
lished by the' Columbus Press of New
York and of which Father. Henry H.
Wyman of Old ] St. Mary's Church, at
628 California street, is the "author.- In
this book many perplexing questions in
connection with' the history and' doc
trine of the Catholic church \ are dis
cussed in a thoroughly logical manner.
The author aims to interest the' infidel
and the agnostic as much as the unbe
liever, and endeavors to* point out the
right way through argument rather
than persuasion. ?-

I The pupils of Esther A. Mundell^Will

"For God's sake.'ys'aid the man, ".I've
been here six different times ' to get a
license, and 'each time :my courage
failed me. Now the ' : girl told me Jif j I
came back without the ' license- she
would marry the other fellow that's
courting her."
"Come in, my good man," said Dan
forth. "You shall have your license." â¢
The new law Is . not in much; favor
with per diem employes of the . city.
If they lay off on Saturday afternoons
they will receive no pay, as there are
no funds available. ' The Instrument
makers in the Department of Electric
ity will appeal to the Supervisors* to
provide the funds, as they, do hot care
to take the holiday at cost of their pay.-
The bricklayers employed by the city
have notified the Board of Works that
if they are compelled to work on.Sat
urday afternoons they must be paid
double wage's under the rules of their
union. As urgent repairs to brick sew
ers must be made at all times the
board is : in a quandary, -aa the funds
on hand are inadequate |to comply,
with the demands of the bricklayers."
The question is a ' knotty one, j and I the
City Attorney {has been asked for an
opinion as to whether the law applies
to per. diem, employes. \u25a0 {
PLEADS FOR liICENSE.
The Assessor's office will have ,one
clerk on duty on Saturday afternoons
during the busy times of the next two
months to accommodate the public. The
Health Office is open only for, the is
suance of burial permits, as it is not
intended that the law* shall serve as
]an obstacle to any one desiring to
shuffle off this mortal coil. A man is
also detailed for. duty ' at the County
Clerk's office In the event that an im
patient attorney may desire to file. a
suit. All the other offices will be closed
tighter than a drum at 12 o'clock, Sa
turdays, even including that of the
Sheriff. Deputy Sheriffs, however, will
not reap any advantage from the half
holiday, as Sheriff Curtis ., will ;\u25a0 press
them into service on Saturday after.-_
noons to serve all" writs filed before ; 12
o'clock. The rush of attorneys to the
Sheriff's office yesterday .morning 'to
file papers was equal to that of a grand
opera seat sale, as attachments must
be levied at whatever cost. H
Then as to the other kind of attach
ments, "Cupid" Danforth ' did not .have
a very busy forenoon yesterday, ' de
spite the publicity given to -the -going,
into effect of the half -holiday, law. At
12 o'clock Danforth had issued but ten
licenses to embark on the matrimonial
sea, Danforth had no sooner closed the
door of his office than he heard a' ter
rific knocking. He opened the door and
a bashful looking swain/ tremblingly
informed him that he desired 'to secure
a marriage license. -; '
"We are closed for* business," said
Danforth. "You know, the half -holiday
law is in effect to-day." - ;- ; -
"I have been waiting for this happy
event every Saturday at 12 o'clock for
the last twenty-three years," said John
Ryan, assistant clerk of the Board of
Supervisors, who began to work for the
city. when \ the water came vp \u25a0 to Mont
gomery street. "The realization of my
fondest hopes seems too good to be
true," continued John as he wiped the
tears from his eyes. All of which goes
.to show.that "all thinga comÂ© to him
wha waits," John !
: "This is as it should be," said Colonel
John- B. Oartland, erstwhile legal ad
viser to the Board of Public Works.
"But the lawmakers might as well
have made the whole day a holiday for
all the business that is done. Then
they could have' thrown in a half-holi
day on Monday forenoon for good
measure to enable the boys to recover
more fully from the severe strain â¢of
the week." /
TO ACCOMMODATE PUBLIC.
Joy unalloyed reigned yesterday
among the employes of the' city Vgt)v
ernment. for promptly at :' l2 o'clock
noori the low. providing for.- a ,'; -half-*
holiday,.' on Saturday went' into
effect. , Probably no law on the statute
books was ever observed with the same
unanimity as the one mentioned. The
last stroke* of 12 had barely been tolled
on the big >ongr at the City Hall than
the overworked attaches in the various
municipal .offices threw down their
pens and official cares and i deserted
their posts for a period ending at 'the
hour of 8:30 o'clock on Monday morn
ing. There were but two or three ex
ceptions, for an inexorable fate in' the
person; of the. head of a department
decreed that: one man should remain
on duty in the offices of the County
Clerk, ; Assessor and Health' Board. -

"Some Dukes Are Excellent Men."---Mr. Carnegie's Latest Statement.
The problem before Admiral Togo
as the Russian Baltic fleet approached
the China Sea: had become infinitely
more complicated and serious than even
the result of a great battle between the
two fleets. Ever since the first attack
onÂ»Port Arthur. (on February 8 and 9y9 y
of last year) Admiral Togo's tactics
have been those of a statesman as
well as those of a naval, commander.
Those who have criticized him 7 for not
closing in with the^ Russians at Port
Arthur and destroying them' in a great
fight between battleships (and there are
many who have thus criticized him se

ADMIRAL TOGO'S PROBLEM.
The great British statesman in some recently published essays
tells how achievements in other lines of patriotic service - are so
much more observed and more highly appreciated than is diplo
matic labor and success. He says the diplomat's , victories "are
made up" of a seriesof microscopic advantages, of a judicious sug
gestion here, of an opportune civility there, of a wise concession Tat
one moment and a farsighted persistence at another; of sleepless
tact, immovable calmness and patience that no folly, no -provocation. 1
no blunders can shake." All this, however, gets no reward of appre
ciation and fame, for writers will not incumber their; pages 'with the
minute circumstances, nor would readers Vead them, ''though- in
the aggregate they effect results; of vast importance."
Sympathetic realization from this reminder of the strain the
Secretary of, State must have been going through in, all these years
to accomplish the important international results he has done, by
the exercise of trained thought-power, and "without": resort .to the
aid of armies ;or navies, will make the nation _, appreciative of his
toil, and wish him a speedy restoration to such; peffect health as
SECRETARY HAY'S breakdown in health 'caused by the ar
duous duties and the nerve racking vexations of diplomatic
work, and his tiredness of the thankless job to which he has
given his best energies for six years past, serve asa reminder of
"some of the complaints of the great diplomat, Lord Salisbury, about
the hard drawbacks to pleasure in diplomatic careers. It has been
said that Mr. Hay, in his .weariness "of toiling for the Government,
and being met with checks and lack of appreciation . by the Senate,
has spoken in half-serious and half-playful way as to. the uselessness
of his going on with the unsatisfactory work of slaving for the
Government when he has the means- to tio' as he likes, and pose
sesses a taste for books and travel. Some conception of the.kind
of persistent energy our overwrought diplomat has had to put forth
may be gathered from Salisbury's statement of how victories â¢ have
to be won by diplomatic art. * . â¢
THE TOIL OF DIPLOMACY.
Dr. Louis Elkind writes instructively
in the May number of the North Amer
ican Review on the subject of "Losses
on the Battlefield." He shows that the
tendency as time has gone on has been
to decrease losses on the - battlefield
through improvements made in sani
tary arrangements, In the medical and
surgical treatment of the wounded 'and
in ballistic arms. The. figures which
Dr. Elkind citesare extremely interest
ing. Between 1741 and 1878, including
the, Russo-Turkish*' war, out of each
hundred men hit\twenty-five perished
immediately, whereas in more recent
campaigns the percentage of immediate
deaths varied between 7% and 15 per
cent. The more perfect the training
and discipline of the troops the greater
are the losses sustained before defeat
is admitted. 'Battles between contend
ing factions in small states hav^ ended
when the losers lost one-half of one
per cent, whereas Russian armies have
not been defeated in some cases until
the ranks have been reduced to the ex
tent of 30 or 45 per .cent.- As a rule,
losses are very unevenly distributed
among the various troops. . In the
Franco-German war the number of
killed in the infantry, amounted to
nearly 53 per, cent, as against somewhat
over 27 per cent in the cavalry and ar
tillery and nearly 18 per cent in the
pioneers." Dr. Elkind says:
"Interesting also would it be to ( as-
. y , -\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'â¢.*
certain what amount of explosive and
shot is required, or rather has been re
quired, to put one man out of action,
striking, of course, an average. The in
formation which we have on 'this point
is very meager. In one battle, however,
â¢the Battle of the Nations,' we are told
that 12,000,000 cartridges were used on
the side of the allies, together with
179,000 gun . charges, and that these
killed or wounded 48,000 men on the
French side. ~ It follows, therefore, that
only one shot in 250 found a human
billet. Every, hit was, therefore, ob
tained at an enormous expenditure of
ammunition. That battle (Leipsic) was
fought as far back as October, 1813, but
in more recent battles the average ex
penditure has been reduced consider
ably. It would seem that' at the -time
when smooth-bore rifles were j used j 325
cartridges were fired for every adver
sary hit, while the old muzzle-loaders
necessitated an expenditure of between
S5O and 475 shots; but with the breech
loader not more than 120 cartridges or
thereabouts are required to obtain one
successful shot. The conflict in South
Africa was conducted on far different
linee from what had ever prevailed be
fore. Battles were fought in which
the contending sides were a long dis
tance apart, and -the, Boers in particu
lar were generally | well: under cover.
Consequently the number, of shots fired
which had no effect was unusually
large." .
LOSSES ON TH E BATTLEFI ELD.
Of one thing the shippers, the railroads and the. owners of pri
vate lines may be sure ; the private car must go. Its use is shown
to produce all of the injurious inequalities which are obnoxious to
public sentiment. The investigation shows that in the operation
of a large business there is no. secret that*, cannot be found out
There are no confidences in business if their object be illicit.
The nature of the contract between these private lines and the
railroads has not yet been disclosed. It is not known how far the
hauler of the cars shares in the profits of their owners. It is a" sys
tem that seem? unnatural. But it much resembles the plan by
which the Pullman sleepers are put on all the roads, except- that the
Pullmans treat all alike, and there are no rebates nor secret ar
rangements. The price of a Pullman berth for a given time is the
same to everybody all over the United States. 1 The complaint
against the private car lines is that they do not deal with the, public
on terms of equality. It is developed in the pending investigation
rhat the Armour line carrying fruit from this State has , charged
shippers unequally for icing its cars. Xo doubt the other j lines
have done the same. The harm goes back to the producer. If the
individuals and companies which get these rebates passed them .on
to the producer, the benefit would fall where it ougljt. I But this, is
not done, unless indeed the shipper who gets the rebate is also the*
producer. < But even then he is the beneficiary of an unequal priv
ilege that is not open to all producers. ..
Just how far the revelations about ice rebates will affect the
railroads that do the hauling is not yet known. The private car
companies are undoubtedly subject to the law of common carriers,
and even if they do not come under the law forbidding rebates by
railroads, they are amenable to the law of common carriers, which
requires such carrier to perform like service for all at like price.
The list of California shippers getting this ice rebate is inter
e>ting, because it runs from individual shippers clear through to
producers who ship through their own co-operative organization.
Every class and kind seemed willing to take the rebate, but it would
be interesting to know by what means they compelled the Armour
line to grant it. A private car line does not give up anything it
can keep. Its policy is not philanthropic. It is in business for the
profit. If it gave up nearly S9O on a car in rebates, it did it on com
pulsion. What was the compulsion?
It will probably be found to have been the offer of another
line to rebate and take the trade. The disclosure will probably
stop the practice and will also go far toward securing the statutory
abolition of the private car system. At this point the interest of
California appears. With the known aversion of the pverland roads
to the encouragement of fresh fruit shipments, will they maintain the
special cars necessary for that trade, and if they will hot do so
voluntarily, is there any legal compulsion upon them, to compel
them?
Of course these problems may solve themselves. With the West
ern Pacific in action there may be an entire change in the attitude
of all the, overland roads toward fresh fruit shipments. It is more,
a question of facilities than of freight rates. At present railroad
operators are unable to figure out a profit in hauling a freight train
on passenger train time. But the fruit shippers; would be greatly
helped by the fast service. It would enable them to put their fruit
in London and Paris in twelve days from the orchard, and it would
bring our own Eastern market within four days. This may be ac
complished by the* discovery of new- methods and devices in rail
roading, or by the discovery that the operators of the roads are mis
taken in their estimate of what they can do with existing devices
and methods. t ' f
It seems necessary at this point to say that,: except in the case
of citrus fruit, the overland reads have not encouraged the ship
ment of fresh fruit from this State. It* requires special cars," not
adapted to 'general, freighting purposes, and the business is full of
risk and frequently incurs losses, for which the railroad may easily
be blamed. For these and other reasons there has been a lack of
co-operation between the shippers of fresh deciduous fruits and the
railroads. If the railroad built refrigerator cars they Avould be dead
capital on its hands for a considerable part of every year. Here then
'.vÂ£S created a situation in which a private car line was inevitable.
The Armours had gained all the necessary experience in distrib
uting fresh meats in refrigerator cars, and they naturally fell into
the place prepared for them in our fruit shipping business and were
soon followed by others.
THE Interstate Commerce Commission is investigating the
methods of the private car lines. .Perhaps these lines are not
as numerous as formerly. Once there was the Biue , line, the
Red line and numerous other lines of freight .cars used all over the
country. These cars belonged to companies separate from the
railroad corporations over whose tracks.they ran. The private lines
paid a royalty for use of the tracks and power.
Finally there rose a contention among railroad owners upon the
discovery that some stockholders. in the roads were also owners in
these private car lines. Having a foot in both camps, they so con
trolled the operation of the railroads that freight in their private
cars had the preference over that .in. the cars belonging to the
railroad. That of course tended to put all of; the business in the
private car lines. There was. much and hot . discussion over this
state of affairs, and in some cases the courts were resorted to for
a settlement. Since then the railroads more generally . own their
own cars and the private car business is almost entirely restricted
to tlie carrying of very perishable property. For this reason we
rind the Armour and other private cars operating very extensively in
California. . . ,"- *-. '

THE officers of the Lewis and Clark Exposition; at Portland have
struck/out something original by dedicating one. day of the
exposition to Joaquin Miller. .He gave the State of Oregon its
sobriquet, ""The Emerald Land," from which it has come. to be
known as "The Emerald State," -and his fame is connected closely
witK Oregon, where his career began. He is a native of /Indiana, 'and
was taken to Oregon by his parents when a child over the old
Oregon trail, on which so many traveled *and so many perished.
\u25a0 The honor proposed for him is also a conspicuous; recognition

never paid them .-any conspicuous attention. Millers-n ative State,

WOMEN IN BUSINESS.
"Thus women were .gradually ex
cluded fronv the more gainful occupa
tions and by force of habit they came
to be. considered unwomanly. Until
recently, though; half the people in
the 'world are females, -there was still
a prejudice; against lady doctors,' and
though 'women are: of ten ;. litigants,
they are -rarely /lawyers, even if the
law permits. . The exclusion of women
from certain occupations increased the
supply and thus , lowered the ' wages in
employments to 'which they, were ad
mitted. In recent years, however, the
great natural economic forces - have
been working in favor of women."
The niost recent and authoritative
statement on the subject, by an econo
mist of note; is to be found in Profes
eor Nicholson's new "Elements of Po
litical Economy." He .say: . "When
large numbers of women were em
ployed in the' same industries as men

the advantage in industrial competi
tion; they " were ' superior in physical
strength and still â¢ more so in moral

The economic "crfuses usually as
signed for the low wages of the woman
worker are the oversupply, due to the
fact that so few occupations are open
to her, the lack of organization among
woman wage-earners, s the fact that
women are seldom. "brought up to the" 1
trade" and consequently\are less high

there are some doctors who ,
are old fashioned enough to stick to it
year in and year out, no matter what
their more up-to-date brethren may
be using for a time. Fortunately, the

do with its efficacy" so if a doctor feels
like it he can make a fool of himself,
as I did Just now, and satisfy the whim
of a fashionable patient by flavoring
her tonics with an essence that matches
her perfumes without endangering her
life. However, freak flavors are not
calculated to make a disagreeable drug

few experiments of that kind most doc
tors, at the request of the patients
themselves, go back \to lavender and
sweet peas and the ever reliable pep
permint."

"The Troll Garden" is a collection of
short stories -by Willa Sibert Cather.
The author is a 'clever literary artist,
and x she writes those stories about
artists and Bohemians, of New York
and vicinity with a skill that is sure
not to disappoint you I when you are
hunting for good short' stories to fill
pleasantly brief spaces of leisure. She
was -a Journalist on the staff .of the

this quotation from Charles Klngsley :

\u25a0 The hymnbooks do not contain a
more exquisite lyric, than Newman's
"Lead, Kindly Light," says Allan Suth
erland in the June Delineator, nor one
that is more acceptable to all denomi
nations of the Christian faith. When,
the Parliament of Religions met in Chi
cago during the Columbian Exposition,
the represenratlves of almost, every
creed known to man found two things
on which they were agreed:/ They
could all join in the Lord's prayer, and
all- could sing "Lead, Kindly Light."
The hymn was written when Newman,
returning home' from'ltaly after a seri
ous .illness, was \ becalmed ' for ." , a
week in the sunny waters of the Medi
terranean. sln striking contrast; the
music was composed by Dr. John B.
Dykes as he -walked through v the
Strand, one of the busiest thorough
fares of London. The hymn was a
favorite' of Gladstone, and also of Pres
ident McKinley, and it was sung far
and wide In the " churches on the
first anniversary of his death and
burial. .
Eight short stories by. Mary Stewart
Cutting, collected under the name of
"Little Stories of Courtship," end up
with one which is worthy of special
notice. It is called "The Perfect Tale,"
and though the title to it refers to the
imagined story of which the author
tells, Mrs. Cutting's own might almost
claim that title to its own sweet self
without risk of immodest usurpation.
The happinesses of the youth who
wrote the perfect' tale and of the maid
en by whose loving aid alone he was
enabled to remember the dreamland
thing he had written but forgotten be
come our happiness as we read, and
we wish that they were real people
and that we might be allowed to send
them spring blossoms for their youth
ful wedding, into whose petals some
eoul of blessing had been breathed to
live beyond the fading of the flowers.
Noel Fa'rrington is the fellow, and
we learn little of his physical appear
ance except that he was long-legged
and his eyes dark-lashed and his face
thin and youthful. First glimpse we
get he's reading of his manuscript's re
jection, but with no sinking into weak
dejection, for his spirit still fs buoyant
after repeated failure, because "he be
lieved so firmly that he had it in him
to write a story some day that would
touch the highest mark of success."
Yet is not this Vh oily conceit, for he
estimates his 'chance of winning as in
volving so far a climb that he elimi
nates love from his aspirations' and
lives on ten-cent breakfasts of milk and
meal as means in bis waiting game.
Noel's friend, Lauter, invites him to
spend a month with a party of visitors
at his home In the Adirondacks. ' Here,
with exquisite art, the writer puts the
youth in an environment which is na
ture's fittest place for. the coming of
the fairy workers of romance to do the
best of favors for the best of their fa
vorites, and here they make the young
man give his spirit willing slave to all
their spells.' On the veranSa of the
bungalow, when the moonlight
streamed "across the mountains and
motionless forest upon the waters of
the lake," and the air was full of the
resinous perfume of the pines, "some
of the men began to thrum hauntingly
on guitars and mandolins at. the feet
of the women whose soft cheeks had a
magic sheen upon them." Amorfe the
girls there gathered was one unknown
to Noel,. but suddenly become special to
him to add a touch of charm to this
night of enchantment; .
That night Noel spent in writing;
for the enchantment -was still upon him
and he could not sleep.^ He worked
till dawn. "Short, simple, almost
child-llke, as was the ". story "he
had finished, It held within It : some
thing Indefinableâ -something that was
divlne^ â and true; -the heart of a
man â the Joy of life. In an over
whelming, moment he realised that
be had written the perfect tale!"

"When James Gordon Bennett, the
elder, was editor of the Herald. Rob
ert Bonner, publisher of the New York
Ledger,; was struggling to build up Its
circulation and; decided to try a little
advertising. He wrote an announce
ment consisting of eight words: 'Read
Mrs. Southworth's new story in the
Ledger,' and sent ltt to thÂ« Herald
marked 'one line.* Mr. Bonner's hand
writing was so bad that the words
were read in the Herald office as 'one
page.'. Accordingly the line was set
up arid repeated so^as to occupy an
entire page. Mr. Bonner was thunder
struck the next morning. He had not
to his name enough money in the
.bank to pay the bill. He rushed ex
citedly over to the Herald office, but
was too 'late to do any good.
\u25a0 "In a short time the results of the
page announcement began to be felt.
Orders for the Ledger poured in until
the entire edition was exhausted, and
another one was printed. The success
of the Ledger was then established.
Ever after that Mr. Bonner was an ar
dent believer in advertising. and a lib
eral purchaser of space." â From
""Modern Advertising," by Ernest
Elmo Calkins and- Ralph Hplden.
Robert Barry, a young man who not I
long ago' was doing newspaper work In
San Francisco and who from that sud
denly jumped to success in" interna
tional journalism as a war correspond
ent, has written a book called "Port
Arthur: a -Monster Heroism," in whose
introductory he gives his opinion: "In
all the long history of military exploits
there is not one that. can. compare in
point of difficulties surmounted with
the reduction .of Port Arthur." It Is
Barry's! first book, and it. is the first
venture of its publishers. We trust
they will mutually give a good send
off, and we wish them both success,
for the descriptions of the great siege
are, graphically written, and the way
by which the young man went to gath
er matter for his writing was right
bold and rightly enterprising, and the
book is happily selective in its pictur
ing and a credit to the publishers in its
neat, plain print and the splendor of
its being bound In the banner of the
rising sun.
Barry, since he left San Francisco to
tackle fickle fortune in the Far East,
with only the capital of $200 and a big
account of courage in himself, has been
a contributor of war articles to many
of the big magazines and newspapers
of England, France and America, and
therefore no reader need fear that in
trying to get -swiftly ' a pen picture of
the now famous assault, which "en
titles the Japanese operations to rank
with the -finest 'work -done by any army
In any age," he will be wearied by
an attempt at portrayal too tyro to be
worth while reading. His style of .writ
ing suits his subject. His words have
charge to them. The "crash of the big
bullets" aeems. vivid, to our. thought as
he tells of , the ' terror of them when on
the firing line and the "desire to return
Is manifold."
Though the _ author's admiration | for
the Japanese is intense, he yet speaks
well for Russia: "Russia has the best
Red Cross Society in the world, and
the Russians are an extremely humane
people." He devotes a chapter to de
scribing General Baron Kodama, whom
he calls "the Japanese Kitchener."
Kodama is a tiny little chap, who
makes a j pretty - picture, but ]he is evi
dently of that fighting \u25a0 type of â¢ Japa
nese whom Barry describes in another
chapter called "From Kitten to Tiger."
He Is the Japanese chief of staff, and-
Barry thinks he 'is the greatest of the
warriors of the Rising Sun.

The size -of this Central African State

and the population is estimated to be at
least 20.00u.000 of natives. Besides these
there are believed to be vast numbers
cf a dwarf race in forests not yet pene

has great possibilities of development.
The State was established in 18&4 and
tince then slavery has been sup
pressed, the Arabs defeated and pre
vented from entering the country to
maraud, there is a good administration
cf justice, agriculture has greatly pro
gressed, polygamy Is being suppressed
and thousands of Christian marriages
take place among the natives. Consid
ering that this is the last place into
which civilization has penetrated,, the
progress of the score of years of the
Free State's life is reported to be most

The pictures and the text describing
the natives are quite interesting. Some

Is wrong. They think they have a right
to ail the wives they can support and
they can buy a -wife for two goats or
a. cow. Cannibalism is not yet wholly
overcome &nd when they eat a man
they have a way of first preparing him
fey breaking his limbs and soaking him

that he may live as long as he can.

The author has very little admira
tion for "the tearful work" of the
Aborigines' Protection Society of Eng

Wack has been a student of mid-
African affairs for seven years, and in
the preparation of his book he had ac
cess to the archives of the Free State
at the offices of the Congo administra
tion at Brussels. While in England he
got his idea that the religious organi
zations there were being used to fur
ther the selfish aims of a clique of Liv
erpool merchants, and later he saw
that the campaign of calumny against
the Congo Free State was being ex
tended to the United States. Then he
decided that his special knowledge
\u25a0would be of value to the world, hence
the book. It is a big, elaborate study
of more than 600 pages and profusely
illustrated with fine full-page pictures.
It is well indexed and has a large col
ored map. Great credit is given to
King Leopold for his establishment of
the Free State and of his management
of It since the nations turned the trust
over to him. It is shown that he had a
noble ambition in planning this design
lor the civilization of Central Africa,
that success in large measure has re
sulted from his efforts, and it is th'i
author's plea that the Belgian monarch
should not be shut out from the fruits
of his enterprise. He has a suspicion
that it will be right in the line of Brit
ish policy to acquire this country as
"the keystone of African territorial
possession," to "make the little fellows
in Africa get out," and so dispose of
the Belgian possessions.. This he thinks
is an iniquity which would be veiled
witn specious pretense, and upon the
attitude of the American people much
depends as to the fate 'of the Free
State.
/ / F \u25a0 > HE Story of the Congo
Â» Free State," written by
5 Henry Wellington Wack,
P a, member of the New
York bar. has a claim
for interest in two ways. One. that the
wonderful progress of this big country-
In the heart of the Dark Continent in
ih<* !ast twenty years is of so much im
port mice, and tbe other that the book
I* an attempt to controvert the attacks
that have been made against the meth
ods of ruling the Free State by the
Belgian Government, and to show that
jealousy of the advance *n value of the
country and Its products, due to Bel
gian enterprise, and a. desire to exploit
the advantages of the Congo region
and do away with Belgian control, are
a part of the motive behind the so
called Congo campaigns In England
and America. It has been supposed in
some Quarters that the author was
writing as an employed advocate of
King Leopold II and his management
of his Central African trust, but Mr.
Wack states co positively in his preface
that he went at his task and executed
it so wholly unbiased by Belgian influ
ence that to doubt his impartiality in
the investigation is to accuse him of
deliberate falsifying.
That Florence should be set down
in the beginning of the story as the
friend of this woman seems about the
only impossible thing in the book un
til you find the explanation in the
knack the widow has of saying things
In such a way that you never can tell
whether she is in joke or earnest. She
says to Florence: "Don't take me seri
ously, my.dear. Men say how difficult
It is to understand women. Do you
know why it is so hard? Because
they don't understand themselves!
"We're like the dog that ate his ship
ping tag â we don't know where we're
going." So much for the widow. She
gets Dick at last, and probably in him
gets her deserts.

York; U 50.)
impossible. While she is \u25a0waiting: in
Honolulu other men love her, and out
of these sudden courtships the story
is made. There are-some descriptions
of the natives' and of the manner of
life in Honolulu. A chapter on the
native custom *^f riding the surf Is
well done. A paragraph out of that.,
which would have been good to pic- ]
ture, tells of how old Kaipo, dressed
only In v loin cloth, rode the surf o:i
a long,- smooth board: "Suddenly
there was a cry that rose to a shout
as Kaipo's dark figure appeared in
silhouette against the . sky. He was
on his knees at first, but as he neared.
the shore he rose slowly erect. The
board he stood on was invisible, so
that he seemed like a god of the air
flying: toward them, brandishing his
paddle aloft like a spear."
Florence is the "girl from home."
She Is tactful through her trials and
at the .end of her embarrassment
makes & nrAich more brilliant marriage
than the one she thought was
destined ' when she set sail. Chief
among the lesser characters is Flor
ence's friend, Mrs. Landry, and in her
we get the study of a widow who
thinks she is very worldly wise and
who is trying to capture and hold the
love of two menâ one a millionaire,
whom .she wants for his money, the
other a gay and irresponsible young
officer, who calls the millionaire "old
Max," because he. the officer, is some
younger. Florence, who loves the
millionaire, flouts this disparagement
by asking the captain, when he is try-
Ing to be court-fit to her,
"How old are you In iniquity?"
Mrs. Landry wants this Captain Dick
because she likes him personally, and
so -by her combination scheme hopes
to get both the man and the money
she wants. How. 'she plans to accom
plish this feat she suggests to Flor
ence when she warns her to keep clear
of Captain Dick Leigh-Garrett. "for it
takes a woman of experience to man
age him. He is not for the young
person." She turned at the door and
sang saucily:
He's not a marrying man, my dear;
He lives on a different plan, my dear.
Keep out of his way If you can, my dear.
He isn't a marrj-injr man!

"Since the Glasgow system was taken
over by the municipality in 1894," he
said to your correspondent, "it has been
conducted by the corporation with
marked success, and the citizens are
to-day proud of their tramway system.
"Since we started in 1894 the system
has, of course, been" greatly extended
and to-day reaches in all directions
considerably beyond ..the municipal
boundaries. Indeed for' tramway pur
poses Glasfeow hus no boundaries, the
object of the corporation being to bring
all the outlying â¢ communities within
seven or eight-miles of the city into
closer touch with Glasgow as the cen
ter. This scheme is being steadily car
ried out, and in a few years will be
almost complete.
"We have, from time to time, reduced
the fares, and I think we are now
almost at the bedrock, the object of the
corporation being, -of course, to carry
as many people as possible at the
smallest fare which will yield a safe
working margin. We also operate th?
system cheaply; indeed, 1 do not know
that there is any tramway company or
municipality operating their system as
cheaply as we do in Glasgow.
"We have, from year to year, made
considerable surpluses, but these have
always been applied In writing down
the capital expenditures and thus re
ducing our indebtedness, because we
may be face to face some day with a
change of traction, and we do. not de
sire that the, department should; be
loaded with the debt of more than one
system. I may .say that, although we
started with an entirely new , horse
traction system in 1894, every item of
capital expenditure has been cleared
off and the capital account to-day con
tains : nothing except the cost of the
present electric system." \u0084 '_,

SCOT COM ING
TO TEACH YANK
Germany has designs on Denmark, '
because the possession of Denmark
means the command of the entrance t
to the â¢Baltic sea. That . command
would be of incalculable value to Ger
many in the- event of a naval war.
There is a belief current in diplomatic
circles that if Germany were involved
in a war with any one power possess
ing a formidable fleet she would geize
and hold Copenhagen and the island
of Zeeland. -
It if, however, by no means certain
âin fact, it is improbableâ that Ger- |
many will wait until some hypothetical
war breaks out before seizing the. en
trance to the Baltic Sea. German im
perialists regard the possession of the
northern end of the peninsula, of
which Holstein is the base, by a small ;
country like Denmark as an absurdity I
which must be abolished at the ear- j
llest possible opportunity. \
At the headquarters of the -German
army in Berlin and the headquarters
of the German navy at Kiel there are
stored away in the secret archives com
plete plans for the invasion of Denmark
by a German army and for the seizure
of the principal points along the Dan
ish coast by the German navy, and the
European situation is so full of far
reaching possibilities that it is impos
sible to predict when these elaborate ,
schemes will be carried into effect. If
the German war party has its own way
the independence of Denmark will not :
be of long duration. !
EYES UPON HOLLAND. !
German imperialists have long cast !
envious eyes at Holland, which at
present foi;ms a j barrier between Ger
many and the North Sea in which Ger- '
mans would like to be -predominant. '
Germans regard themselves as the
head of the Germanic race and hence
the natural protectors of the Danes
and the Hollanders, and ,the proper
owners of the countries inhabited by
the Danes and the Hollanders.
A number of Pan-Germanic writers
have published books and essays prov
ing from their own point of view that
the destination of Holland is to become
a province of the German* empire, and
articles in which similar views are ex
pressed can bY found in the German
newspapers of Pan-Germanic tenden
cies. . i
In Holland the possibility of future
German aggression is fully recognized
and the intensely. ariti-German feeling
which prevails among all sections of,
the Hollander population is due to
the repugnance with which they con
template the prospect of being subju
gated by their powerful neighbors.
When the time comes for Germany's
ambitious schemes to be carried but
the Hollanders will doubtless defend
their liberty with the bravery which
is characteristic cf their | race, but
their struggle will be futile. i
When the right time comes Ger
many wjll_ take possession of Holland'
with as little compunction as a big,
commercial concern has in crushing a
weaker competitor out of existence,
and the acquisition of the Dutch sea
board, together with the port of Rot
terdam, will be an immense gain to
German prosperity. From a naval
and military point of view the posses
sion of a port such as Flushing with*
in 100 miles of the English coast will
be extremely valuable to Germany A
powerful German neet with Flushing
as its basis would be a serious -menace
to England.
The" possession of Holland would re
sult in numerous advantages of various
kinds which are so "obvious that it is '
, superfluous to dwell on them.
FUTURE OF AUSTRIA.
The possession ' of Denmark, ' which
will include command to the approach I
of the Baltic; Sea, and the conquest of
Holland, which will supply the desired '
outlet to the North. Sea, will. by no !
means satisfy, Germany,' s thirst for ex
pansion. The adherents of the German
war party_have long watched : the de
velopments of domestic "affairs in Aus
tria, with undisguished satisfaction
because the political crises through
which that country has been passing
for many years. leads to the conclusion
that the Hapsburg f empire may crum
ble; to pieces after Francis Joseph, the
present venerable - : occupant of the
throne, has, gone .to his fathers^ Aus
tria is a mere collection of
neous elements connected: at" present
solely by the personality of the Emper
or Francis Joseph, iand the- conse-'
quences , which *;the v loss ; of > that link
would cause have of tenVbeen described

BEBUN. May 13.â Germany's wax
pjirty Is a force -which must be rec
ogaized and reckoned -with In interna
tional politics, because it Is rapidly be
' coxnlcg cse of the most potent political
influences In the German empire. At
present the German war party might
just as well be designated by a more
peaceful name, such as the German
Imperialist i>arty, or the German ex
pansion party, since its Immediate aims
are rather preparations for war than
the precipitation of hostilities with any
othsr country.
Thp most prominent member of the
German war party is the German Em
peror himself, who has far-reaching
axnbitions regarding the future of his
country and of his dynasty- Long be
fore he came to the imperial throne,
William II was full of romantic ideas
of the future expansion of the German
empire He is a man of vivid imag
ination and he seeks visions of a fu
ture in which the German empire will
be the great world power, enjoying
predominance and supremacy over all
; other countries, including those which
â¢ are now superior to her in magnitude
and strength.
The Emperor's whole system of gov
ernment from the day on which he
ascended the German throne up to the
present time has been one prolonged
eScrt to increase the prestige 'of the
German empire among the great pow
ers cX the world and to extend Ger
man influences into regions in which
the German flag was formerly quits
unknown. His naval policy, his Inter
ference in China with the mailed fist,
the part he played in the Venezuelan
trouble, and all the other features of
his foreign policy have been undertak
en with a view to increasing the inter
national power of Germany.
OBSTACLES TO GROWTH-
The German war party has no
clearly defined programme and it is
probable that the aims pursued by its
various members are widely divergent.
Generally speaking, the German war
party purposes, by means of an ener
getic and aggressive foreign policy, to.
increase the power of the German em
pire, to enlarge its area and to entend
,lts commercial connections and influ
ence. There is no doubt whatever
that many prominent members of the
German war party look forward to a
time when a much greater part of the
map of Europe will be occupied by
Germany than is now the case. Ger
man imperialists will extend the boun
daries of their country in every pos
sible direction. It is obvious that in
certain directions extension will be
impossible, at, any rate within an im
measurable period of time.
Further Scheme Is
the Overthrow
of Austria
: The removal by order of the Presi
dent to-day of Walter F. Matthews,
United ! States Marshal at Portland,
bears out the" prediction In "a recent
special dispatch to The Call that a
"certain creature^of Mitchell's" was
scheduled to go." Matthews is said to be
one of the Federal ring that has long
held Oregon In its grasp. He was the
chairman of the Republfcan State Qen
tral ' Committee, f but^ antagonized his
own parts* to such an"extent by his po
litical manipulations that when Blnger
Hermann,. Matthews' friend, ran for
Congress he was .elected by a very
smair majority over Reames (D.), in a
district normally overwhelmingly Re
publican.; Charles J. 1 Reed, an insur
ance agent at Portland, was appointed
to succeed" Matthews. .
WASHINGTON, May 13.â The death
of Judge Bellinger at Portland, Or., has
somewhat disconcerted the proceed
ings in the land-fraud cases.
Attorney General Moody had a con
ference with the President this after
noon, and it is, probable that Judge
"William H. Hunt of Montana will suc
ceed Judge in the handling
of. the cases. ; -'.
LONDON, \ May 13.â Another big
English electrical contract has Just
gone to an American firm. It la for the
construction and equipment 'of the
overhead ; trolley line of the Dundee,
Broughty Ferry and District Tram
ways Company, in Scotland. This is
the; first interurban electric railway to
be built ! in ; the United Kingdom which
parallels a â¢ steam railway. 7lt runs for
its Â»w,hole length alongside the; Cale
donian and North British Railway. J.
G. White & Co. of New, York and Lon
don secured the contract for .$500,000.
The line passes through the j estates of
Lord Home and Craigie. They are the
first landowners in Great Britain who
have adopted the American idea of do
nating, a- private right of way for the
purpose of Improving the value of their
contiguous property.
The road will be equipped with nine
ty-pound steel rails. The cars will be
double-decked and carry two ; thirty
seven horsepower motors.' The 'ratio of
operating expenses is fixed at 60 per
cent; and if is estimated ;the prc-perty
will : net 8 per cent ; upon a capitaliza
tion of. $600,000 after paying all fixed
charges.
. J. G. White & Co. have, within two
months, closed contracts in England
for $7,820,000 of electrical railway;con
struction. This .includes the complete
construction of the Belfast Corporation
Tramways, which was the subject lof
actiye competition. The American firm
secured the contract because of its abil
ity to guarantee. that the line would be.
ready for operation by ; October 1. In
addition the firm has j secured the ! con
tract to construct twenty-four miles of
road for the London United Tramways,
which must be finished this fall. It
will link up the riverside resorts along
the Thames as far as Kingston Hill,
with the London County Council's sys
tem operating in the 'metropolitan dis
tricts. /

The Leading: Specialist.
I Cure the Cases That Others
Cannot Cure. i
i A bold statement, but just aa ;
I true as It is bold. Not all cases ,
j that others fall to cure are cura-
ble by my methods, bat fally nlne-
, - ty per cent of them are. The wa>
to learn whether your case ia
curable is to consult me. I know-
exactly what can be done in every
instance. I ought to know this,
for I have done nothing? other |
' tban treat men's disease* for sev- }
rntcrn year*. If your tase Is i
I curable I will treat you. If it
: isn't I will not. If I treat you,
! and if you so desire,
j I Will Wait for My Fee Until
You Are Well. |
i WEAKNESS ; I
J Functional weakness in men is
1 in reality a comparatively simple
ailment, and Is bnt a symptom of
local dlMorder, a state of chronic
inflammation of the prostate
I gland. No stimulating treatment,
: whether internally or locally ap-
plied, can do more than excite
temporary activity. By my sys- i
tern of local treatment I restore i
nliMolutely normal conditions {
1 â¢ throughout the organs involved, 1
1 which promptly results in com-
plete and permanent restoration
of strength and vigor. This treat-
ment is original with me, and Is
1 the only radical and certain cure
I yet devised.
; I alno completely cure, with uo-
varying; Naccens. Varicocele. Con-
tracted Disorders, Spermator-
| m rhoea. Lost Vicor. Specific Blood
. I Poison. Stricture. Piles and Reflex
: Ailment*.
\u25a0 I
|; I Consult Me
1 ' Frequently there is a misappre-
hension as to the cost of the ser- j
, vices of a competent specialist. :
Some sufferers are inclined to
1 think that because of the com-
; plete cures I make my fees are
1 r exorbitant. They are not. They
j are simply FAIR, and are usually
j worth five times what I ask. Be-
; fore you try other treatment it
will be to your interest to consult
: me. That will cost yoa nothing.
; * If you follow this advice you will
SAVE money.

which- I can .truthfully say he did. The

Let* mail advices from New York say:
"TfclegTaphic advices received from the -coast
en "Saturday inoicjiteil a somewhat firmer feel
ing among sellers of future apricots, which was
attributed to purchases by exporters of three or
lour cars of Southern fruit for August ship
ment at 6>ic f. o. b. In bags.
"The epot prune market at the end of last
week was very quiet, and the feeling unsettled.
Jr. the view of prominent handlers of dried
fruits the situation re^ts on demand. If the
demand in Eastern markets does not Improve,
permitting of an actual increase of-distribu
tlon for consumption, price* ln these markets
v. ill not materially advance. A clean up of
t!ie nocks hell liere, however, would find buy
ers confronted by a strong coast market, and
en advance ln epot prices would necessarily
follow. Ac to future prunes, there is no dis
position to buy except at pricee which It has
U-en amply demonstrated no one on the coast
vill for a moment consider. The fact that
iiiere ere no tellers in the market on a low basts
and that orders for Eorue fcrty cars on a 2o
basis were either ignored or turned down last
wk i<? accepted as good evidenoe that the
itportffi damage 10 the crcp is no less and may
b< Â£TÂ«\atÂ«r than at firrt reported.
Tht-re wÂ«ro indications of reviving- interest
in spot ralelns at the close of last week, but
it tocik the chape of fairly numerous Â«mall
orders, rnaicly for fancy seeded atcck. With
light supplies here the tendency of prices was
upward, and while t>i4e was still named as ac-
Pfptahk In some quarter* 6%c was a more gen
eru quctation. tr.d ia some Instances fl J/scJ /sc was
rieraajiccd. There are very few loose musca
ts It taiTif-d here at pretent, and these arÂ» held
t' 4S-4>Â»;C for two crowns, 4sJ@se for three
crn'SFTjK and 5%(3>6c fcr four crowns. Persian
Aataa are in a strong position and an advance
cf a^i eighth of a cent is expected to-day."

\u25a0 Continuance of bullish speculation under the
leadership of local outside operators has been
the feature of the market the last week. A
good Liverpool market . helped the local situa
tion, to-day. Trading was light and confined
principally to covering.
The report of G. If. Salisbury Section Di
rector, T'nited ftajes Weather Bureau, for the
\u25a0U>sh:r;pton Crop Bunetin, week ended May 9,
is- as follows:
Crops have made rather clow growth dur-
Inp ;he ;iast w<--ek on account of cool nights,
which werp frosty on two or three occasions,
c fo'.l orhicb -has not got warmÂ«^l up yet, and
a Ueflcient rainfall in come parts of the State.
The frosts on the 1m and 4th of the month
Â«f-r e injurious to vegetables and in some in-
Ftances to fruit. Prunes have dropped so that
ln many localities there will be onjy one
fourth to one-half of a crop. Strawberries
were coi.eiderably injured, and so were cher
ries.
Cats nn<i potatoes have grown only elowly in
tbr- \u25a0restern counties, owing to coo! soil and
lark of rain. Hops have made satisfactory
pTofTPTf. but have grown unevenly. Meadows
ani raptures reed rain.
Fall and winter wheat, barley and alfalfa
arp prowing steadily although not rapidly.
in the eastern counties., but they had such a.
ftart from tlie <>i>r!.v spring that they are four
weeks e&rlifr than last year. Oats were dam-
Bpfd b y frosts on lowlands in some localities.
Corn is b<lnj? plajite<J in the wanner counties.
At the close of the week a steady rain has
Fet it:, which will undoubtedly be of immense
benefit to crops.

CURED BY CUTICURA
Blessed Relief After First Application and First
Real Sleep in Weeksâ Facts of This Won-
derful Cure by Cntlcura Vouched for by
.Mrs. Hunt's Neighbors.
"Words cannot describe the terrible Eczema I suffered with. It
broke out on my head and kept spreading, until it covered my whole
body. I was almost a solid mass of sores from head to foot. I
looked more like a" piece of raw beef than a human being. The pain
Â«ru^ an<^ agony I endured seemed
>^|||ill|yjjfe^ more than I could bear.
â¢ JHÂ»Â» "Blood and pus oozed from the
\u25a0AJ^^^r^^^Fr ffih â¢ Â£ reat sore on m y sca *p' * r Â° m vn *
,a||||Â§Â§' ,) der my fingernails, and nearly all
TsUsiiP /Â«Â» j$ over m^' ears were so
3> crusted and swollen I was afraid
. they would break off. Every hair
n m y k ea( * fell out. I could not
sit down, for my clothes would
/ stick to the raw and bleeding
sgag&Spl^f <a^^ flesh, making me cry out from
" M - v family doctor did all he
/yizM%/ "â¢' &\f^sw/7 could, but I got worse and worse.
&Vfy con ditiÂ° n was awful. I did
&sP5> ' ///" not tWnk I could live, and want-
W Sfe/ViJ 3 P ed death to come and end my
*^'\ vl J frightful sufferings.
"In this condition my mother-
in-law begged me to try the Cuticura Remedies. I said I would, but
had no hope of recovery. But, oh ! what blessed relief I experienced
after applying Cuticura Ointment. It cooled the bleeding and itch-
ing flesh and brought me the first real sleep I had had in weeks. It
was as grateful as ice to a burning tongue. I would bathe with warm
water and Cuticura Soap, then apply the Ointment freely. I also
took the Resolvent for the blood. In a short time the sores stopped
running, the flesh began to heal, and I knew I was to get well again.
Then the hair on my head began to grow, and in a short time I was
completely cured. But I kept on taking the Cuticura Remedies, as
they did me so much good I did not want to stop them.
"My cure was so wonderful I thought I would write yon about
it. I cannot praise Cuticura enough. I wish I could tell everybody
who has Eczema to use Cuticura. My condition was so terrible that
what cured me cannot fail to cure anybody or this awful disease. If
any one doubts the truth of this letter, tell him to write to me.

Wilson told how . he had met Croker
in the barroom of the Coates . House,
one of thÂ» leading hotels in the city,
where the negro was employed as por
ter. Croker, Wilson said, had asked
him on Thursday evening "where lie
could have a little fun." Wilson; had
told him of an opium den in. the, north
end and offered to conduct him to the
place after 6 o'clock, .when he would-be
c?f duty at. the hotel. Crbker waited
until that time, and then went with the
negro to Con Cronin's saloon at Fourth
Â«treet, on Broadway. . There Wilson
suggested that if Croker had any
monÂ«y he had better j?ive it to the bar
tender for safekeeping "before '; they
started out. Croker gave the bartender
iwer.ty dollars, saying it was all he had
except soran change, and the bartender
placed the money, in an envelope in'; the*

Local interest in Croker's death'cen

and told a connected story -that' fitted'
in closely with all they had learned
about the case from other sources,', it
was decided to put him through - an
other severe examination.

KAXSAS CITY. May. lS.â The Coro-
Der's verdict in the case of Herbert -V.
Croker of New York, who was found
dead on a Santa Fe train near New
ton, Kans., is that he "came to his
death while between Kansas City and
Newton, Kans., from the effects of nar
cotic poison taken into his system at
Kansas City before boarding said train,
by means and manner unknown to the
jury."
Chief of Police Hayes of Kansas City
cays that Croker's death was due jto
overindulgence in whisky and opium-
Chief Hayes says. there is little to in
dicate that the New York man was
robbed, and none to show that he was
drugged except by himself, v
The body of Croker te at Newton
awaiting the arrival of his brother
Richard from New York, who is ex
pected to reach Newton Sunday night. '\u25a0
The undertaker who embalmed the
body says the young man appeared to
have been in fine physical condition.
The two Chinese who conducted the
cpium joint and the negro porter,
Charles Wilson, who took Croker to
the place, are in jail, but they are not
charged with any offense in connection
\u25a0Â«vith Croker's death. The Chinese will
be prosecuted for keeping an opium
joint, and Wilson's testimony will be
nsed against them. The Chinese say
Croker had smoked opium before.
A number of persons, despite the
opinion of Chief Hayes, are convinced
that Herbert Croker was drugged and
robbed at Kansas City. The clothing
he wore evidently was not his own,
being of cheap material and , badly
polled. The hat that he wore had on it
initials other than his own and bore
the. trade mark of a Minneapolis,
Minn., firm. His own clothing evident
ly had been Â«tolen and other garments
given him.

BISHOP CASTLE DECLINES
FURTHER CHURCH HONORS
LONDON, May 13.â Otho Stuart,
I manager of tha London Adelphi. must
: be feeling a bit like Frankenstein at
j present. Stuart hasn't called any iin
j couth monster into being, it is true,
I but he is directly to blame for the ex-
I traordlhary epidemic of "Hamlet"
. which is raging In London just now.
That epidemic hasn't reached its
height yet, but it promises to do so
in a week or two, when no less than
, ten Princes of Denmark are to be on
view at different London theaters.
It was the uncommon success of the
Adelphi revival of "The Taming of the
Shrew" that decided Stuart to follow it
with "Hamlet," and, as every One
knows, H. B. Irving was chosen for the
Dane and scored immensely In the
part. Probably~Stuart had no -idea
what would be the consequences of
this on his part. Probably it never
entered his head that practically every
contemporary actor of prominence
who ever had essayed "Hamlet" would
promptly be moved to essay it again.
But so it was to be. Hardly had the
Adelphi "Hamlet" been produced \u25a0
than the announcement came that
Beerbohm Tree would also be seen as
the Dane, and no sooner had the pub
lic mind recovered its serenity than
news came from Dublin, where Mar
tin Harvey has been appearing,, that
the erstwhile Sidney Carton was plan
ning to give London a taste of his
"Hamlet." ><
Tree has already appeared as the
Dane, both with the ordinary Btage
accessories - and without them â .. In
terest in his single performance at Ox
ford upon a Btage hung with green
curtains! having- led him to repeat the
experiment at Majesty's., E. P. !
Benson, too, has been giving VHam
let" at Stratford-on-Avon, and now,
"to make the thing complete, an aston
ished theater-going world has !earned

from the United States recently, means

With all due respect to Clyde Fitch's
talents it would be better for the rep
utation of American dramatists in gen
eral if the managers would stop try
ing to please Lyndon audiences .with
his plays. The thing cannot be done
âand "Her Own Way" is further proof
of it. Even Maxine Elliott's personal
charms fail to distract attention from
the thin theatricalness of the play,
as seen through London eyes. The
first night performance at the Lyric
was warmly, even enthusiastically, re
ceived by the Americans in the stalls,
but the Briton In the pit said "boo"
at the final curtain call and the British
criticd mostly said "booV in the papers
next morning, although there were
many kindly words for Maxine Elliott's
beauty. There is an unfortunate tend
ency here to accept the vulgarities sat-i
irized in the play as typical Ameri
canisms, and the sardonic Times critic
gets almost a column of amusement
for himself in viewing the \ whole thing
as an entertajning ethnological. exhibit,
not ta be discussed seriously as drama.
"EVERYMAN" IN ENGLAND.
One wonders. on what the feelings of

in both England arid â¢ America.' Tita

LOOMIS REMAINS CAIM.^ ! S-
WASHINGTON, May IS.-^'NanV Pat
terson, accompanied by her father and
Mr. and Mrs. J. Morgan Smith, ar-,
rived in Washington from New York
this morning, and upon leaving the
tra:n the party at once proceeded .to
the Patterson home, on Columbus
Heights, a modest nvo-story cottage,
where they arrived In time for break
fast.
A crowd of curious persons awaited
the arrival of the train At the Penn
sylvania depot. It was just S o'clock
wheuMiss Patterson made her appear
ance iXom ttie stateroom she had oc
cupied with her sister during the night.
A carriage was in waiting, the police
the crowd back while all of
the iiarty entered the vehicle. As the
door of the carriage slammed the
crowd, which had been silent, voiced
its apjirtval in cheers.
Miss Patterson was dressed in a cos
tume of blue, with hat to match, and
looked well and refreshed by the good
sleep she said she had enjoyed. As
she reached the car door her father,
who was with her, said to a number of
newspaper men en the platform, "This
is 'Nan' Patterson."
"I can only say that I am glad to
ccc you," immediately responded Miss
Patterson, "and that I am so glad to
pot home." â " j
When the carriage containing the
party reached the corner of the street
adjacent to the Patterson residence the
impatient girl could restrain herself no
longer. She sprang from the vehicle I
and ran down the block, stopping to I
hug: and kiss her relatives as she came 1
to them on their way to meet her. '
Fhe hesitated only long enough to give i
a brief greeting to each In her hurry !
to reach her home and mother. She
disappeared through the door after run- i
ning up the steps with outstretched j
arms and the word "mother" on her j
lips.
Mrs. Patterson, who was overcome \u25a0
l>y the news of her daughter's freedom
yesterday, stood, supported by the ;
arms of her husband, on the front ye- !
i anda, and with tears of happiness !
glistening in her eyes and a quiver of !
emotion in her voice said, "My daugh- j
ter is with me now. All my children \
are home. I am so happy." :
"Nan's" father said that ' although j
many nattering offers of engagements;
had come to his daughter, none of them j
had been considered and none would '
be for some time. She will first take a
long rest.

Premier. Balfour's speech In the
House of Commons on May Jl, on the
defense of India, from this standpoint
came at a particularly inopportune
time, and the comments of some of the
American papers which' have been ca
bled here have also . aroused some re
sentment. HH
ST. PETERSBURG, May 13.â The
danger of serious complications over
the question of French neutrality is re
garded as over for< the present.
Throughout there has been a disposi
tion to make allowance for the vexa
tion and irritation manifested by Japan
in the desire to safeguard her Interests
at a moment when the future of the
war is staked upon the issue of the
coming navai ~ battle. \u25a0 Nevertheless her
willingness to assume a menacing at
titude toward France upon the strength
of the British alliance Is regarded as
being an eye-opener for the powers.
Despite the provocative tone of the
British press, however, the British
Government used Its Influence at To
klo In pacific directions. However, the
harsh things said of the French and
Russia in the British, papers have so
far as the Russian public is concerned
served to still further inflame the feel
ing of hostility against Great Britain,"
which has always been regarded as
Russia's arch enemy.
The Government authorities, while
not considering the trouble is imminent,
share the public belief that it is essen
tial to make speedy preparation for the
defense of Indo-China,- and accordingly
large special credits are being asked
for, the ministries of Marine and War
are considering large augmentations of
the forces in Indo-China and Admiral
Fournier is planning a chain of coast
defenses similar to those with which
he has encircled France. The admiral
and representatives of the army and
of the colonies will probably proceed to
Indo-China shortly to personally in
spect the requirements.
This sentiment has been slowly ma
turing into conviction. The first sus
picions were aroused some months
ago by the publication of a detailed
plan of campaign said to have been
drawn up In the Japanese War Office
for the invasion of Indo-China. The
denials which followed the publications
of the plans have not failed to change
the , popular belief that Indo-China is
menaced and Foreign Minister Del
casse and other Ministers have . . ad
vised Parliament to give suitable at-*
tention to the request of the colony.
The recent agitation at Tokio against
Admiral Rojestvensky using the
waters of Indo-China has given new
gravity to the question. Such con
servative papers as the Temps and
Figaro say that Japan's action clearly
discloses ulterior motives against the
French colonies, while the radical
newspapers, like the Patrie, give sen
sational prominence to statements al
leging that Japan is able to land troops
above Hanoi, the capital of Tonquin,
sweep southward with practically no
opposition and simultaneously occupy
Kamranh Bay and other unprotected
coast points. This doubtless is exag
gerated, but it contributes to estab
lish the belief that energetic measures
are necessary to place the French col
onies in a complete state of defense.
The reassembling of the Chamber of
Deputies on Monday is expected to
renew the agitation of the questions
of Morocco and French neutrality.
The notice given to Foreign Minister
Delcasse by M. de Pressense (Socialist)
of his intention to interpellate the' Go
vernment on its foreign policy promises
to bring about a decisive issue be
tween the Minister and the Socialists
who have been criticising his policy.
ATTITUDE OF RUSSIA.
territorial ambitions in Indo-China,
which the French must sooner or later
defend. Although the Japanese offi
cials disclaim any .such intentions, this
belief has taken firm hold of the French
public and press, .which unites In call
ing upon the Government to adopt en
ergetic measures, strengthening the de
fenses of Indo-China and prepare for
the contest which, it is asserted, will
be inevitable when Japan's hands are
freed from the Russian war.
PARIS, May 13.â The popular out
burst at Tolcio ag-ainst France leads to
eettled convictions here that Japan has
Echoes of the Moroccan imbroglio fill
the air. In Crete there is a hard nut
to crack. A new Armenian uprising is
expected and the boldest prophet does
not venture to predict the acquies
cence of Abdul Hamid in the drastic
proposals the powers are making at
Constantinople for Macedonian super
vision. Balfour's carfdor concerning
the Russian menace to India has made
a deep impression throughout Europe.
FRENCH PEOPLE AROUSED.
\u25a0 That the contingency of the invasion
of Britain should have been gravely
discussed in Parliament at such a junc
ture is indicative of the serious turn of
public thought. London does not fear
the result of such an enterprise, but
Germany and Germany's master are
Impulsive.
LONDON. May 13. â Without Indulg
ing in alarmist sentiments, it may be
eaiely asserted that the international
eituation is not reassuring. There are
clouds in the sky and they do not be
come smaller. Tokio's official statement
that Paris has done all that is desired
of her in the line of neutrality meas
ures is another illustration of the mag
nanimity and patience of Emperor
Mutsuhito, but It leaves matters where
they were before. Plenty of combust
ible material is lying about and if Rus
eian naval commanders v pursue their
insolent policy of disregarding instruc
tions from St. Petersburg and warn
ings from the officials of neutral pow
ers, a big explosion is possible.
London journals remind France in a
friendly way that should the coming
naval battle go against the Russians,
Togo may have to hunt the vessels of
his foe into French territorial waters
and point out that France will not have
the best ground for complaint if awk
vr&rd complications arise after the bat
tle.

has been discovered in the sailors'
quarter of Odessa. Six bombs" ready

Peaceful crowds, if not organized
for demonstrating, will be permitted

sign of approaching trouble. The
workmen paid their accustomed Satur

ST. PETERSBURG, May 13.âTo
morrow, -the Russian .. May,' day,' is
awaited with nervousness both by the
public and the authorities. The revo
lutionary agitators would like to make
it another "red Sunday. in" every city
of the empire and everywhere are^urg
ing workmen to celebrate the ,fete~with
anti-Government demonstrations I and
to resist with arms if the "police and
troops interfere.. â¢ \u25a0 :'-;.' ''. * .
â¢ â¢ The- agitators are covertly aided _ by
Radicals, who have not the courage to
come out in the open and who are try
ing to pave the way to set up the cry
of shooting down of innocents in the
event of bloodshed by warning th^au
thorities that- the meetings are intend
ed to be pacific; but a perusal of the
countless j proclamations with which
the St. Petersburg streets are flooded
proves conclusively that it is really in
tended to percipitate collisions.. Many
workmen are said to . be armed 'With
bombs and revolvers and a large stock
of pistols of an automatic repeating
type, smmugled in for the revolution-^
Ists, are being offered for \ sale \to .the
initiated' at cost price.
Fortunately saner Liberals, and
even those of .radical views,' realizing
the futility of bloodshed, are counsel
ing the workmen not to jeopardize
their lives uselessly. The police also
have issued \systematic warnings.
Nevertheless, disdaining the advice of
well wishers and defying thÂ£ warn-"
ings of the police, the Social Demo
crats and Social Revolutionists have
called big meetings to be held at
Smolensk Field on Vassili Island, at
the Preobrajnsk Cemetery on the
Schusselburg Chausee, where some* of
the victims of January 22 are buried;
at the Petropavslov Park in the Vl
borg quarter; at several places in the
Putiloff district and at other indus
trial centers. It Is alrribst too much
to hope the day will pass in Russia
without collisions or bloodshed.
Governor General Trepoff and Di
rector of Police Kovalensky, while ex
pressing the hope that all will be quiet
to-morrow, as far as St. Petersburg? Is
concerned, admit the possibility, of
disorders.' At the same time they In
sisted that if blood is spilled the re
sponsibility must rest on those who de-.
liberately provoke it.
Elaborate . precautions have- been,
taken. The garrison of the city was
further reinforced during the week
and a large detachment of Don Cos
sacks arrived to-night. They . stared
open-eyed at their view : of . the ; St.
Isaac's Cathedral and other sights of
the big city as they rode to their quar^
ters. T\Â»enty-five thousand Cossacks
were stationed -to,-night in various
quarters of the city, principally in the
outskirts, and all .of the guard regi
ments are under arms, but . specific
written orders issued by Prince Vas
silchikoff, Grand Duke .Vladimir's aid,
who will be in active command, with
orders that they must- not. fire unless
actually -attacked. Special orders
have been given to the Cossacks, who,
with the gendarmerie, will be used
to disperse * the crowds, to \u25a0 not even
draw their cutlasses unless in the event
of a Cossack being killed orj wounded, 1
but to employ their whips freely if
necessary to ,\u25a0 scatter demonstrators.

the Navy Morton to-day stated that he
had no present Intention of resigning
from the Cabinet. He said, however,
that it was thoroughly understood be
tween the President and himself that
he should leave the Cabinet next fall.
It is said that the Secretary agrees
with the President in the main points
Involved in the question of railroad
rate regulation by Congress, but he
does not think that radical changes
are wise. The Secretary decidedly says
that there is no truth in the report that
there is likely to be- a "Cabinet crisis."
That there has been any misunder
standing with the President over the
Santa Fe rebate question is denied by
Morton, but the Secretary of the Navy
has never been particularly enamored
of his position in the Cabinet for purely
business reasons.

The Barons Porgrell ' of Germany
and their woman friend, Miss E. Fox
of London, who were ordered out of
the Palace Hotel Friday night for con
duct not in keeping with the ethics
of that hostelry and who later went to
the California Hotel, have moved
again. Late Friday night, after the
trio had engaged apartments at the
California and had gone out for a
walk, the management learned of
their experience at the Palace and
concluded to separate them by plac
ing them on different floors of the
hotel.
When the travelers returned to the
California and found that their apart
ments had been changed they raised a
loud protest, and, failing to get any
satisfaction, visited police headquarters
and told their troubles to a sergeant.
An officer was sent back to the Cali
fornia with them, but a short talk with
the night clerk satisfied the guardian
of the peace that he was without juris
diction in the case and in the interest
of good morals he kindly advised the
Germans and their fair companion to
accept such apartments as the hotel
was disposed to give them. Finally,
appreciating the suggestion of the of
ficer, the angry guests retired to their
rodms. Early yesterday morning,
however, they summoned an express
man and. hurriedly left the hotel with
their baggage, but not until they had
given the management of the hotel
to understand that as soon as they
returned to Germany they would have
a bill passed by the Reichstag -wiping
off all German maps that portion of
the United States commonly . desig
nated as California and having 'all
reference to San Francisco and ita
hotels eliminated from the tourist
guide books.

GRANTS PASS, Or., May 13. â The
mystery of the Dunlap murder has
been completely solved by the confes
sion just made by Andrew Dodson be
fore District Attorney Reames. Dod
son acknowledges that it was he who
fired the shot that killed the old min
er, William Dunlap. at the latter's
cabin in September, 1903. Dodson
cays he is suffering so keenly in con
science that he believes it better to
tell the truth and go by the shortest
route to the sallows, preferring death
to his present torment or to life im
prisonment.
At first Dodson declared it waa his
partner, Ingram, whoÂ«4ired the shot.
Dodson says he and Ingram planned
the murder of the old man while
they were cutting wood near his cab
in, to secure the gold they thought
\u25a0was hidden under the floor of the
miner's house. Lloyd Ingram, the 15
year-old eon of Ingram, overheard the
plot and followed Dodson the next
day when he shouldered his rifle and
eaid he was going hunting. Ingram
went to Grants Pass for supplies. That
night the two men and the boy went
to search the cabin. The boy says he
\u25a0was forced to aid in the search and
was charged to secrecy on penalty of
death.
Dodson has also confessed to other
mysterious crimes that have been
committed here during the last two
years, among them being two stage
robberies and two strange disappear
ances. â¢

Dr. Dawson Asserts Question Is Not
for Baptist Conference to
Solve.
KANSAS CITY. May 13. â "It -la no
affair of this convention to solve the
so-called negro problem. It is our
duty to find our duty and recognise
and discharge It. God will take care
of the problem."
The. report of Dr. I*. O. Dawson of
Alabama, chairman of a commission
appointed at the Nashville convention
a year ago to Investigate work among
the negrces, was delivered before the
annual Southern Baptist Convention,
now In session In this city. The above
declaration, in which Dr. Dawson
opened his report, caused something
of a surprise and his report as he con
tinued was listened to with unusual in
terest.
Continuing, the report said: "By far
the greatest force in leading the negro
up from savagery has been his varied
contact with Christian white - men and
women. The Southern Baptist Con
vention should stand, as it \u25a0 has al
ways stood, for the application of
every possible uplifting agency to
the negro situation and therefore
should welcome - every contribution
from whatever source for the proper
education of the negroes. Chief
among these contributions la the 5130,
000,000 paid by the Southern States
through taxation for this purpose."

Will Form a New Federation
to Embrace California,
Oregon and Washington
A meeting of the executive commit
tee of the; State Federation of Citizens'
Alliances was lield at the headquar
ters in the Crossley building yesterday
afternoon. State President W. E.
Alexander called the meeting. to order
at i p. m. with the following pres
ent: Herbert George, president San
Francisco Alliance; John A. Clark,
secretary Stockton Alliance; I*. T.,
Mayhew, secretary Sacramento Alli
ance; C. F. Carl, secretary ' Oakland
Alliance; Messrs. L. L,. Gross v and
Charles C. Champlin ' of Petaluma,
Fulton G. Berry of Fresno and F. J.
Zeehandalaer of Los Angeles. ' Other
.cities were represented by proxies.
The question of forming a Coast
Federation of Alliances, to include all
the ; alliances from Seattle to San
Diego,, was taken up and a committee
was appointed to confer with the offi
cers of the various alliances and com
plete the federation.
Requests for charters for new alli
ances at Eureka, San Pedro and San
Rafael were received and referred to
the committee on organization, with
suggestion that immediate action be
taken.
Herbert George spoke at length on
1 the benefits that would accrue to the
shipping and mercantile interests of
this city from < the formation -of the
United Shipping and Transportation
Association, which , will control : the
shipping interests. Organization has
just been completed.
Champlin spoke of the situation at
Petaluma, which he declared to be an
"open shop" town, and stated that a
mass-meeting would be held there
next Wednesday evening under the
auspices of the Petaluma Alliance.
I PEACE IN SACRAMENTO.
Secretary Mayhew of Sacramento re
ported conditions favorable, with all
contractors busy and workmen satisfied
and that the influence of the alliance
could be best > illustrated by the fact
that during the 'three years' prior to
April 1, 1304, there had been seventy
one strikes and labor disputes, involv
ing a loss of over $1,000,000 to the
laboring people alone, and that since
that date there had been â¢ but one
Btrike and that one settled perma
nently on a strictly open â¢ shop basis.
The merit system of wages Is observed
and the hours have not been , in
creased, except by some union men,
who are working without limitation
as to hours or restriction as to wages.
Law and order is strictly enforced In
the capital city and the merchants "re
port conditions favorable for a banner
business year. ;
The secretary also ' reported on the
special work done at Fresno s and ex
plained the action of the master
plumbers and employing members *of
the builders. :A declaration for open
shop made about February 15 has
been rigidly observed- arid . is giving
good results. .The effort of a would-be
political leader vrho dictates the ac
tion of the State Building Trades
Council to inject politics into the
Fresno council resulted in the dis
banding of the council after the elec-;
tion in April. Mr. May hew predicted
that the conservative labor element
would predominate in the Fresno
unions and that strikes would soon be
but a memory of the past in the
raisin district.
John A. Clark of, Stockton announced
that all was quiet in that city, as there
had not been any serious labor disturb
ances there for many months. Fully
one- third of the business . houses of
that city are now running on a strictly
"open shop" basis.
MEMBERSHIP INCREASING.
The merchants and manufacturers
realize that - the maintenance* of the
Citizens' Alliance is necessary to Insure
Industrial peace, and cheerfully lend
their, moral and financial support to the
organization, considering It a sort of
Insurance against labor disturbances.
The membership is steadily increasing
and there have been no desertions from
the ranks. ' '
"All. of the laborers In unskilled lines,
as well as all skilled laborers, are busy,
most of them with steady employment
and good wages, as all of the . "open
shop" employers pay the union wages,
or more when the employe earns it, and
maintain the same hours . as formerly.
Merit, and not union affiliations, regu
lates their, compensation. , Union men
are learning that {there is no premium
placed upon grafting ' and that merit *Is
what . wins advancement and .increase
of wages. .The employers t ruhnlng "open
shop" declare that: the men are; more
cheerful . at their \u25a0 work and accomplish
far more "than when their ; output'. was
limited by | union , rules and * they â¢ them
selves were annoyed by the commands
of walking delegates. . \u25a0, J.
O. F. Carl of /Oakland reported \u25a0 the
alliance there to -be in , a flourishing
condition, v There ' has '.'\u25a0 been no- labor
trouble ; in J Oakland /for \u25a0 the past ; six
months ; and the".- city is rapidly pro
gressing . toward the j "open J shop/ ; All
of the ' livery." stables . are non-union.

City- Treasurer McDougald yester
day received ' assurance from two
friends 'which will enable him to raise
the remainder of the $15,590 08 which
his ex-chief deputy, Louis Devoto,
obligingly - handed to defaulting Tax
Collector Smith on a bogus check. The
Building Trades Council also sent Mc-
Dougald a check for $2000, voted to
him at a recent meeting. McDougald
has been treasurer of the' organization
and never charged one cent for his
services. On that .account was' the
money voted to him to help him in his
trouble. There .was but one dissenting:
voice at the meeting and that came
from a bricklayer, who said all the
money in :the treasury/ amounting to
$ 5000, should ' be .given to McDougald.
The latter 'hopes within a day or two
to turn the entire amount secured by
Smith ; back into the city treasury.
With 'a wisdom born of experience,
Chief Deputy "Perkins yesterday de
clined to receive a check for $SOO on
the Central Trust Company, ' presented
at the city treasury by E. B." Young as
collateral inheritance taxes due on the
estate of \u25a0P. G. Somps. McDougald

he,would have to deposit 'the. cash. No

Joseph Burns confessed that while he
\u25a0was driver of the German Hospital am
bulance he sent in calls for that vehicle
to visit several places where it was
not needed, his sole object in so doing
being to obtain for himself an outing.
It was his wont to go outside and tele
phone to the hospital that the ambu
lance was urgently required for the re
moval of a patient , from a remote
dwelling, then to enjoy a long and fast
drive and to return to the hospital with
the information that no such house
could be found by him. If he had not
overworked the trick he might still be
When the landlady responded to his
ring Mr. Root informed her that he de
sired to see Mrs. Hoppe, and he was
conducted to the parlor and requested
to there await her coming. But instead
of she whom he expected to meet it
was her husband who walked into the
apartment and demanded explanation
of the cause of the visit. Mr. Root said
something about having been a school
mate of Mrs. Hoppe's father, but Mr.
Hoppe scoffed at the explanation.
Then quoth Mr. Root, "And who are
you?" To which Mr. Hoppe replied, "I
am one who is exclusively qualified to
protect from persecution the lady
whom you seek." Mr. Root said some
thing in retort, and then his hat and
spectacles were damaged.
"As you do not appear to have been
very seriously Injured," said the Judge
to Mr. Root, handing back to him the
headgear and glasses, "the case Is dis
missed. And It would be wise for you
to permit this lady to pursue her mat
rimonial way in peace." Â»
Mrs. Hoppe. a tall and statuesque
young person, smiled approvingly upon
her husband, her inferior in stature,
and Mr. Root gathered up his exhibits
and moodily departed.
Prior to her wedding, about two
months ago, Mrs. Hoppe was employed
as a stenographer by Mr. Root, who
managed the Keystone View Com
pany's agency at 456 Montgomery
street, and after she ceased to work
for him he pursued her with an as
siduity indicative of infatuation. As he
was a husband and father, the lady
avers, she never encouraged his suit
while she was a maiden and strictly
forbade it when she became a wife. But
he continued to annoy her, and after
she had repeatedly declined to visit him
at his office he succeeded in ( inducing
her to go there by falsely representing
that a letter awaited her coming. Fin
ally she told her husband of how she
was hounded, and her obeyal of his
advice that she go abroad as seldom
as possible resulted in bringing Mr.
Root to her residence.
As material evidence that his charge
of battery waa not slightly founda
tioned, N. D. Root deposited upon the
desk of Police Judge Cabaniss a paper
parcel containing a hat and spectacles,
both of which, he averred, had been
rudely knocked from their re
spective resting places upon his
head by the clenched fist of E.
Hoppe. The alleged assault occurred
lrst Friday afternoon in the parlor of
the boarding-house at 754 Bush street,
where Mr. Hoppe and his brideâ the
latter was formerly Miss Ida Slaughter
â resided, and the defense was that Mr.
Root's uninvited attentions to Mrs.
Hoppe provoked her husband to smite
him.

ThÂ« Â«evÂ«loiÂ»ment of the Klectro-Chemic j
tr*ftUnent tn tbe care of Cancer* and Tumors
U tbe greatest medical achievement of this j
*re. or any ace. for that matter. Surgeons j
often ablÂ« to remov* cancers ana tumors
eucceserully. the patients living through the
Â«PÂ«ratlcn, only to have a return of the diseaee
in aome other location after a few months'
time. The gerta of cancer cannot be cut away.
and If the B*rrn remains in the system the dis-
ease of necessity is sure to return. Electro-
Chemistry kill* the cerm. and If surgeons
would srlve their patients a course of Electro-
Cbwnisiry alter their operations for the re-
moval of the cancer, or tumor mass, there
would be no return of the disease. The spe-
eia.l:Â«tÂ» of the lilectro-Chemic Institute. 118
Grant aye., are now giving many patients a
course of Electro-Chemistry after surgical :
treatments, and every patient operated upon .
ehould have this Electro-ChÂ«mic course. It â¢
should be remembered, however, that many of
these severe cases will be cured by Electro-
chemistry without operation and it Is also im- j
portant to remember that the Electro-Chemie :
treatment is absolutely painless, absolutely ]
harmless and entirely without danger.
The wonderful achievements of Electro- \u25a0
Chcrr.'.stry are not confined to the cure of can- j
cers, tumors, ulcers, old sores, abscesses, lup-
us, eczema and all blood and skin diseases. :
but it is successful when all other treatments '
fail, in consumption, catarrh, asthma, bron-
chitis, deafness, ringing ears, head noises, diz-
ziness, headache, neuralgia, rheumatism, loco-
motor ataxia, paralysis. eczema. blood
poison, diseases of the stomach, liver
and bowels, constipation, indigestion, piles,
fistula, female diseases, euch as displace-
ments, irregularities, painful ovaries, in
diseases of the kidneys, Brlght's disease, dia-
betes, 'nflimmation of the bladder, special dis-
eased of men, stfeh as proistatitis. nerve ex-
haustion, stricture and enlarged prostate. In
ail cases, consultation and examination is free.
The Electro-Che rnic home treatment is very
successful. Patients living at a distance are
loaned a full niectro-Chemie outfit for the
home treatment. It Is always beet, however.
for such a person to come for a personal ex-
amination when rx>Â«sible. The Electro-Chemic
Institute, the enly onÂ» on the Pacific Coast. Is
located at 118 Grant avenue, corner of Post

Apropos of John Forster it has been
heard with much satisfaction that the
demolition of buildings on the west
side of picturesque Lincoln's Inn
Fields to make room for a new thor
oughfare will not involve the destruc
tion of the house .where for over twen
ty years lived the friend and biogra
pher of Dickens. Forster was , living
there when he \u25a0\u25a0 succeeded Dickens' as
editor. of the Daily News, and there he
used to entertain the great novelist on
some of the latter's visits to town after
he had established . himself by the "seal
It was on one of these occasions that
"Bor,V running up from Broadstairs
for . the â¢ purpose, reac .to an admiring
circle of cronies- the manuscript of a
certain immortal, story called "The
Chimes." -
Dickens i also made ; the house, serve
for old Tulkinghorn's | chambers,' and
it suits the .\u25a0; character ' better.' nowa
days, when it ; has become i the '-\u25a0 lair Jof
lawyers and ] accountants, than .when it
was the scene of the : hospitalities â¢of
the burly biographer. ' The house is
pretty grimy now,: but it has r a/: dash
of portentous ". picturesqueness ' when
approached .through the ; public â¢ gar
dens in' front,: and '-though' it is, topped
by an ugly telephone: staff and 1 , the
roof of a big electric' generating; sta
tion at \u25a0 the back,-;, it still * retains some
thing, of the old stateliness ! that; made
it a fitting: habitation^ for. one > of j the
leading literary; lights . of: his .day. \u25a0\u25a0'-:
At the Wright sale in 1899 "The Bat
tle of Life" fetched $2000, the highest
sum yet paid at auction for a "lot'Vof
this kind. Morgan's other, purchase
comprises the original manuscript .of
"A Cnristmas \u25a0 Carol" and that '< of
"Hunted Down," the first story writ
ten by Dickens for an American pe
riodical. ' .
A HISTORIC HOCSE.
A letter by Richard Cobden on "Tar
iff Reform" is to be cold at the same
time, and another Cobden letter which
is likely to come into the market soon
has, like the Nelson document, a spe
cial interest at the present time. This
letter was written by the great free
trader on October 15, 1849, after a jour
ney through Russia, and his reference
to the personnel of the Russian fleet is
particularly interesting. Cobden says
in part:
**I wish the alarmists about the vast
resources of the Czar could all take a
trip, as I have done, into .the interior
of that country. Russia is a succession
of villages composed of log huts wide
ly scattered over an interminable pine
forest, in a country where coal does
not exist and where the winter lasts
half the year. People confound in their
minds the defensive force and the ag
gressive power of Russia. She is in
vulnerable against foreign attack by
land, because no large army can be
concentrated within her borders (un
less It be in Moscow or St. Petersburg)
for want of accumulated stores of food,
etc. â¢ â¢ â¢ She has, it is true, a large
force of ships of war, but they are
manned by serfs taken from the vil
lages of the interior, who are unde
serving the name of sailors, and it is
pretty certain they would never ven
ture into an engagement with an Eng
lish or American fleet, and if they did
it is quite certain they would be taken
or destroyed."
Nothing seems more likely than that
both these letters will be bid in by J.
Pierpont Morgan, who recently bought
two of the few original autograph
manuscripts of works by Dickens which
are not in the South Kensington Mu
seum. Dickens bequeathed to his
biographer, John Forster, , the original
manuscripts of nearly all his most im
portant works, and it was after Fors
ter's death that they passed â¢ into the
possession ot the museum in Kensing
ton. â¢ The exceptions' included a couple
of fragments of "Pickwick," one of
whichâ a single page describing the
wedding breakfast at old Wardle's â
brought $500 at auction in 1903. A larger
fragment of "Pickwick," of about
thirty-three pages, belongs to "WV A.
"White of Brooklyn. Much of the' more
valuable of Morgan's purchases is "The
Battle of Life," written on fifty quarto
pages, mounted by the author, the text
varying in parts from the printed ver
sion. This ' -manuscript was valued
twenty-one years ago' by a London
dealer at $800. Later it passed into the
collection of William Wright, who
owned so many Dickens treasures, in
cluding the set of "Pickwick" present
ed to his sister-in-law, Mary Hogarth.
OOBDEN 3IAXCSCRIPT.
LONDON. May 18.â ThÂ«rÂ« la ttme-
Ruess about an autograph letter of
Lord Kelson's which Is to b* sold at
unction this month. On May 4 It waa
cxaotly 100 yÂ«an cineÂ« it was wrltttn.
Moreover, Nelson penned this mlssiva,
wUeh wu addressed to Lady Hamil
ton, on board his flagship. Victory.
â¢when he was yearning: to meet the
French fleet opposed to him as Ad
miral Togo must be aching to tackle
the Russian armads. ";'*"'
Kelson collectors here, who, by the
way. are hoping against hope that the
letter may not be carried oft! by an
.American, consider the manuscript's
chief value, however, to be the refer
ence which Nelson makes in it to his
"dear daughter Horatia." The letter,
dated May 4, lfeOS, runs thus:
"Your poor, dear Nelson is, my dear
est beloved Emma, very, very unwell.
After a two years' fag It has been mor
tifying the not being able to get at the
enemy. As yet I can get no informa
tion about them. At Lisbon this day
â¢week they knew nothing about them,
but it is now generally believed that
they are gone to the West Indies. My
movements must be guided by the best
judgment I am able to form. John Bull
may be angry, but he never had any
offense. Who has served him more
faithfully? But Providence. I rely,
will yet crown my never-failing exer
tions with success, and that it has only
been a hard trial of my fortitude in
bearing up against untoward events.
You, my own Emma, are my first and
last thoughts and to the last moment
of my breath they will be occupied in
leaving you independent of the world;
and all I long in the world that
you will be a kind and affectionate
Father to my dear (a word obliterated)
DAUGHTER HORATIA. May God pro
tect you and my dear Horatia, prays
ever your most faithful and affection
ate, &c" -^.

rious private canals is about 8000 acres
out of a total area of 236,000. The lands
of the Klamath basin are great in area,
of excellent quality and the water sup
plied Is in .excess. The cost per acre
for irrigating the land is unusually low,
and public lands constitute 45 per cent
of the total area."
"Existing canal systems will be;in
corporated as a portion of the distribu
tion system of the Federal project- The
Secretary pf the Interior has /signed
several contracts for the purchase' of
private canals and, reservoir sites. Ar
rangements have been reached with the

"The State of California, has con
veyed to the United States Government
for disposal under the reclamation act
all its title to these lands by an act
approved February 3, 1905. Oregon has
made a similar concession by an act
approved January 20, 1905. The United
States has granted the privilege of
lowering this lake and disposing of this
land under the reclamation act, by an
act approi^ed February 9, 1905. This
Federal act also conveyed a similar
right to drain and dispose of the lands
of Little or Lower Klamath Lake,
which are included in the Lower Kla
math basin and which are a portion of
thte project.
"The total area of public land in the
*Tule Lake bed contains approxi
mately 54 : 176 acres of land, all of which
Is public. This is an Interstate lake.
It is estimated that by withholding the
liood -waters of Lost River, v.hich is the
main source of water supply of this
lake, in Clear Lake and Horsefly reser
voir sftes, and by the diversion of the
remaining portion of Lost River into
IClarnjaUi River, about 50.000 acres of
the lar^cV in the bed of this lake will be
"uncovered ."by evaporation, which
- amounts to three feet per annum. The
rainfall is In the neighborhood of ten
luches.
"The 1.0v.-er Klamath basin, exclu
sive of T/.lp Lake, contains L 1.324 acres
of public land and 86,721 acres of pri
vate land, a totel of 133,045 acres. These
lands will be reclaimed by a diversion
ctinal from the linger Klamath Lake
t<nd by the lowering of the outlet of
Lower Klamath I^ake.
The area that may be reclaimed in j
the Klamath basin, exclusive of any :
future developments in the Shasta Val- [
ley, is as great as the entire area of j
land now irrigated in Southern Califor-, j
nia. A board of engineers, consisting !
of W. H. Sanders, Joseph Jacobs, T. H. !
Humphreys, O. H. Ensign and G. Y. â¢
Wisner, have recently inspected and j
reviewed the project in the field, and â¢
also the plans and estimates of Mr. j
Humphreys, who is the project engi- i
ncer, and have made favorable recom- !
jnendations to the"Secretary of the De- '
j artment of the Interior. '
In part Mr. Lippincott said: 'There
are three valleys, known as Langell. i
Alkali and Poa, In the basin of Lost
Kiver. Under the proposed upper canal
*ystem of the Klamath project they
eontaln 5503 acres of public lands and
<2,&52 acres of private holdings, a total
of 45.3n" acres. j
TWO RESERVOIR SITES.
"It will be necessary to utilize two |
reservoir Fites, known as the Clear Lake
reservoir site on Lost River and Horse
Fly reservoir cite on Miljer Creek.
These reservoirs will perform the dou
ble function of restraining flood waters
for the irrigation of this land, the re
duction of which waters will cut off
the gTeater portion of the pre-sent water
tupp!y of Tule Lake, which is a basin J
without an outlet. ;
J. B. Lippincott, 'supervising engi
neer of the United Slates; Reclamation
Servi<-Â«Â», announced yesterday that ar
raxig^nents h.ive beÂ«n made with the
owners of private rights and existing

The north of England seems to be a
fertile soil for large families, for In
1797 we read of a Cumberland man and
his wife, accompanied by thirty of
their children, all attending the chris
tening Â»of the thirty-first child, and In
earlier years another north country
man, Thomas Greenhill. applied to thÂ»
then Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal.
for an augmentation to his coat of
arms on the singular ground that he
was ."the seventh son and"*the thirty
ninth child of one father and mother."
v In Conway churchyard there was to
be seenâ lt can scarcely be there to
dayâa tombstone bearing the follow
ing remarkable epitaph: "Here lyeth
the body of Nicholas Hocker of Con
way, gentleman, who was the forty
first child of his father. William Hock
er, by Alice, his wife, and the father
of twenty-seven children. 1637."
If a man's family be considered as
including all his descendants that of
Peter Smith, who In New
Jersey in the seventeenth century, la
entitled to a high place of honor, for
at a recent annual gathering of Pe
ter's progeny no fewer than 7000 met
and dined together tinder the apple
trees in the orchard attached- to thÂ»
ancestral homestead.
In the families it is not an nnknown
thing for one child to be old enough to
have a sister or brother young enough
to be his or her great-grandchild. Thus
the eldest son of Thomas Beatty of
Drumcondra has passed his seventy
third .birthday when his youngest
brother qualified for the cradle. When
William Frost of Galphay, near Ripon.
died in 1789 his eldest child was" a
Bturdy boy of 88 summers and his
youngest was barely 16, and the Lady
Powerscourt of. to-day is half a cen
tury older than her latest brother.
There are cases on record where a
century or more has divided' the wed
ding days of* father and son. The first
Earl of Leicester was first married in
1775, and his son led his second wife to
, the altar In August, 1375; while Cap
tain. Francis Maude, who was married
on June 28, 1549, was following the ex
ample of his father, â¢ Lord Hawarden,
had set him ninety-three years earlier.
In 1756. /But both these cases are quite
eclipsed by that of General G. Steven
son of Bri3tol, who was united to his
third wife in 1834 at the age of 83, and
whose father was first wed in 1704, the
year of Blenheim. This seeming im
possibility Is accounted for by the fact
that the father, who was born in ISSO.
was married for the third time at the \u25a0
age of 70, and the general was the son
of . this late union. Thus we get the
remarkable result of a man who" 8
father was born in Charles ll's reign
wooing and wedding within the mem
ory of many people still living.â Tit-

POINT RICHMOND, May 18.âDur
ing a dense fog which hung like a pall
over the waters of the upper bay this
morning the steamer H. E. - Wright,
bound from Antioch to ' Oakland with
a cargo of brick to be used in the con
struction of . one" of the new manufac
tories on the water front of that city,
ran on the Jagged rocks of San Pablo
Point, and to save his vessel from sink
ing before he could reach a place of
safety Captain John ! Har kins beached
the steamer on the mud flats just off
the Wilson-Lyons briokyard, about two
miles from Point Richmond.
The accident ; happened at 2 o'clock
this morning while the -Wright was
steaming through San Pablo Bay. At
this point a strong current sets In to
ward the shore, and In the \u25a0 heavy fog
the first warning of danger 'came when
the vessel crashed on the rocks. A
hole \ nearly three feet square was
pierced in the steamer's bow and a tor
rent of water poured into the hold.
Captain Harkins at once ordered the
pumps started, and backing away from
the shore headed at full speed for the
mud flats on' the eastern shore of the
bay.
The Wright's signals of distress were
answered by the steamer T. C. Walker,
which stood by to save the crew until
the disabled vessel was successfully
beached. 5* f -,

to graduate.
It Is not unusual for seniors to bÂ«
â¢â¢cinched,** as the college phrasv has it.
but never before â¢ has It been reported
that such a large peroentase of the
class has been unable to satisfy the po
tent, grave and reverend "dons" who
conduct the examinations at the uni
versity. Neither has it been customary
for "so many prominent seniors to fall
by the wayside at the end of the term.
In the cases of some of these stu
dents, wbo are known to be exception
ally clever, and even brilliant, the ex
planation Is at once forthcoming that
excess of class functions, official activ
ities and the like have Interfered
with their studies, making it Impracti
cable for them to do the requisite
"digging" before examinations. Eu
gene Hallett. president of the senior
class, does not expect to graduate, al
though he Is generally conceded to be
one of the ablest men that have at
tended the university. He has made a
rocord as a worker in high executive
positions, having been editor of the
Blue and Gold, business manager of
the Californian. editor of the Pelican,
chairman of the rally committee and
now president of the senior class. He
gave up the chairmanship of the rally
committee and the editorship of the
Pelican when elected class president a
few months ago, in order to have time
for his studies, but It was too late to
make up for opportunities lost.
Augustus Keane, rated as perhaps
the most brilliant of the men who take
peculiar interest In literature and the
drama, editor of the Occident, ranking
h'.gh In every among students and
faculty men, does not expect to gradu
ate. In the same situation are such
men as "Jack" O'Connell, a prominent
eenior; John Edwards, â¢who was among
the half-<lozen selected to speak at the
big university meeting two .weeks ago,
â¢v hen the most prominent seniors were
called upon for brief addresses; Wil
liam Hussey Murray, business manager
cf the Occident, known to be far above
the average student in point of scholar
ly achievements, ability to assimilate
matter that is taught, and ranking high
with his classmates as a student and
executive officer. Murray, however, did
not expect to graduate, as he had been
out for months on account of Illness,
\u25a0nd accordingly planned to continue
his work at the university next term.
The crowd of seniors who fail to
graduate are planning a social func
tion on the night of commencement
day, when President and Mrs. Wheeler
hold a reception for the graduating
class in Hearst Hall, that is calculated
to help them forget their natural sor
row and regrets. Plans for this affair
are not yet complete, but arrangements
are now being made by the seniors who
already have been informed that they
need not expect to be awarded diplo
mas this term.

OAKLAND. May IS.â The orew of the
British steamer Heathdene, now lying
at IÂ«oxis Wharf, in tnla city, is In near
ly a complete state of mutiny 'as the
result ot the accidental dlsoovery of
oontraband of war In the ship's earro.
The sailors declare that unless they
are siren a suitable bonus to compen
sate them for the risk they will run.
they will leave the ship In a body.
Their articles signed In Nerwoastle-on-
Tyue do not call for any nwiardoua
serrtoe, and the men claim that thÂ«
British Consul will support them In
case the matter should ffo to extremes.
The Heathdene was lylnÂ« In ToWo
Bay when the British ship Knight
Oommander was sunk by the Japan
ese in the e&rly stages of the war, and
the fact that the sailors on board that
unfortunate vessel lost all their pos
sessions, even down to their clothes,
has sunk deep Into the memories of
the Heathdene's crew. The men are
now at almost the end of a three years'
cruise, and each has a collection of lit
tle keepsakes and souvenirs that he in
tends to take home to his friends. To
run the risk of losing these little treas
ures and perhaps spend several
months in the depths of a Russian
prison hulk Is more than the men care
to do, unless they can expect to gain
a substantial reward for taking the
chance.
One member of the crew spoke his
mind in the following way:
"For my part (and I think every man
on the Heathdene feels in the same
war), I will not go out on the ship if.
she Is going to carry machine gun
shells, unless I have a written prom
ise of a bonus in hard cash before we
leave port. We sailors do not receive
enormously large pay and under the
best of circumstances incur all kinds
of danger, and if we take a chance of
losing what few possessions we have
while blockade running I 'think that
we ought to receive at least a small
part of the profits from it. I knew
men on the Knight Commander who
lost everything except the clothes
they had on their backs when she was
sunk, and I am not going to have that
happen to me if I can help % It.": .
The crew of the Heathdeane j num
bers seventeen men, of whom five are
Japanese, one Greek and the "remain
der English, Irish and Norwegian, and
the' greater proportion of them have
large sums coming to them as wages,
the carpenter, for Instance, being a
.creditor for $1000 and the others for
sums ranging from $960, $750, $525,
$260 and so on down to $16.
United States Immigrant Inspector
David J. Griffiths found that two of
the Japanese members of the crew
are affected with trachoma, and that
several members deserted within the
last two days. Should it be found
that any of the deserters are suffer
ing with a contagious disease Captain
W. J. Mllburn will be placed under
arrest. Otherwise, should the desert
ers have been passed by the medical
department, the captain will be called
upon to pay the immigrant tax of $2
per head.
The munitions of war destined for
Japan filled seven cars. The mem
bers of the crew are thoroughly
frightened and declare they cannot be
forced to remain with the steamer un
Â«er their contract, which does not call
upon them to assume war risks. They
were very much relieved yesterday
when Informed that the owners had
decided to unload the dangerous
cargo.

Comment on Dr. Peters' attitude was
running very freely at the Congress
to-day. His statement that the book
of Genesis is full' of mytha; that Abra
ham, Jacob and Isaac were not real
people in the commonly accepted sense,
but are merely composite photographs,'
so' to speak, of Israel, and that much
or what Is recorQed of the patriarchs
Is purely. romantic, led to no end of ar
ffument, approval and criticism.
Dr. Peters to-day elaborated his con
tentions that the Bible as a historical
narrative must be subjected to ana
lytical and synthetical criticism, just
as any other record of/events. The
rector added that the legends
were superior to other folklore In that
they served to point to a higher moral
and spiritual life; - f Z-:- _^--/. ".
His analysis of personalities which
have come down to us under the names
of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and. Joseph
startled the more conservative mem
bers ofl the congress and elated the
more progressive.

Peters of St. Michael's Church has con

1 The twenty- fifth anniversary of the
ordination to the priesthood of Very ,
Rev. Archdeacon John A. Emery will'
occur on Tuesday next, and prepara
tions have been made by the jfriends '
of the Archdeacon, in conjunction with
the clergy and offlcials of the diocese of
California, ;to mark \u25a0 the interesting '
â¢vent > by appropriate ; services. vlt has \u25a0
been determined to, consecrate on this :
occasion the pretty chapel of Holy In- |
nocents at Corte ' Madera,- which was t
organized and : since its erection has j
been served by Archdeacon Emery and ;
grown into one of the most prosperous .
mission parishes in the diocese. A new }
preacher Trill now. take charge, as '
Archdeacon Emery has -decided to re
move to Berkeley. '*
Archdeacon Emery Is the only cler
gyman of the church, with the excep
tion of Rev. D. O. Kelley, whose con- I
nect ion with the diocese has continued
for a quarter of a century. All of his \u25a0
associates who were officiating at the j
time of his ordination have - either re- '
moved or else are no longer living. The \u25a0
whole period of the Archdeacon's mm- â¢
isterial duty , : has been spent In and
about San Francisco. For a number of 1
years he officiated in the Church of the
Advent, Kast Oakland, and left it a
prosperous j and self -supporting -: parish. I
St. Peter's, San Francisco, was his next j
charge, and, heavily in debt. Through'
Archdeacon j Emery's . persistent and ;
earnest work the debt was greatly re- j
duced and -!the church Improved. The :
Bishop then placed him in charge of
the Church of the Advent In this city, â¢
which was at the time in a dangerous |
condition, ' owing to a huge debt in- ;
curred in building the new church. The
Archdeacon, through " ; excellent finan- }
cial management, was able : to settle a :
threatening litigation and to reduce the .
debt '',;. to manageable . proportions.
Through his efforts the valuable prop
erty was saved to; the church.
The growth of the diocese, since the I
advent of the present Bishop, has been â¢
so marked that the appointment of an !
Archdeacon was demanded and an ap- j
peal made* to the diocesan convention j
for authority, to create the office,' leav^ j
ing the choice of such an official In the J
hands of the Bishop. Rev. Mr; Emery" j
was the j first and only person consid- j
ered, and the appointment has been j
fully justified.: His * labors have been J
abundant, and at the present time
thereis not a county iri the Jurisdiction
or a cnnsiderable town^ in whichthere'
it not a t church regularly served ; by.'a
priest. The Archdeacon 7 precedes the
Bishop ; in new " centers.' He " expedites
the raising of money and stimulates the
zeal of members. ;-^ In his charge lies '\u25a0
the raising and expenditure of the mis-
Bionary. funds, a.nd' in this direction
Archdeacon Emery has exhibited re
markable judgment. The confidence of
the church in his ability has been more
than fulfilled.';; Its growth ; in strength j
end influence has been . remarkable
; since he wasj appointed. Though two
i d ioceses' have been . formed from the
I original one," the mother diocese is now j
L stronger 'in members - and churches
than -ever before. The Episcopal j
I church in Pan Francisco is now thie
strongest Protestant denomination. v
fi The consecration at /Corte V Madera
will -begin at 11 a;; m.; Boat leaves at j
9:601 a .% m. -The' ceremony Iwill be con
ducted by bishop Nichols, who will
preach. :' A" largej number of clergy will |

ble it has been necessary to change the
place of the production from the Ma
jestic to the California Theater. The
opera opens accordingly at the Califor
nia to-morrow night.
The entire production is made under
the auspices of some of the leading
women and women's clubs of San
Francisco, . headed by the Twentieth
Century Music Club. It was arranged,
as has been stated heretofore In these
columns, as a benefit, to Madam Mod-
Jeska, but since her benefit *in New
York' netted ther so handsomely Mod
jeska has requested that the proceeds
be devoted to local charity.
Boxes for the opening night have
been taken by .Mrs. Francis Carolan,
Mrs. H.M. A. Miller, Mrs. Will Tevls,
Mrs. Pfingst, Mrs. B. F. Norris, Mrs.
E. J. Foster, the Woman's Press Club,
Mrs. Frank P. Deering and others.
The company comprises over fifty
people. An orchestra of . twenty-five
musicians, with John Josephs .as con
cert master, : will ' be , conducted? by
Madam Carusi herself. â¢ This 5 will be
the first time so large an orchestra has
been led by a woman In \u25a0 San- Francisco,
therefore, both libretto and' music being
by Madam Carusi, an unusual interest
attaches to the. occasion. - ,
Alleged Boodler Occupies a Cell in
Sacramento County Jail.
SACRAMENTO. May 13.â Escorted
by Deputy Sheriff Edward Reese, ex-
Kenator Frank I^rench walked into the
Sheriff's office at S o'clock to-night and
etood siloTitly at the rail. The deputies
with v. horn he had a passing acquaint
ance sat inside and waited for him to
greet them, but he apparently did not
ccc them, for he neither nodded nor
Epoke. There was a pause for a few
seconds and then Night Jailer Timothy
Hagerty picked up a ponderous key
and motioned the ex-Senator to follow
him. Soon the heavy prison door
clanged shut and French was
shown to his narrow cell, which was
next locked upon him. The adjoining
cell was occupied by ex-Senator Bunk
ers, but no salutations were exchanged
by the boodlers. French uttered no
word from the moment he stepped into
the Sheriff's office.
"I never saw a man so badly % broken
up in aU my experience," said Jailer
Hagerty, who has served as turnkey at
Folsom Prison for a dozen years, "he
showed it by. what he didn't do and
%*hat he didn't say."
Deputy Sheriff Reese said the ride
with his prisoner to Sacramento' was
made In silence. It is expected that no
attempt will be made to secure fcail for
the prisoner in Sacramento, French re
lying upon San Francisco friends to
come to his rescue Monday or Tuesday
next.

beas corpus proceedings when , the
Grand Jury filed into the. courtroom to
lay the law's heavy hand on him who
is so well versed in freeing those who
have ; become enmeshed in i that same
law.
E. J. Bowes, who ]is acting as fore
man in the absence of Thomas P. An
drews, ; presented an 'indictment, with
the request that it be placed on the se
cret file. While Collins undoubtedly
knew that he was the one accused,
there was no formal process against
him and he quietly left the courtroom
and returned to his offices *in the
Crocker building.
"v Judge Lawlor ordered the warrant of
arrest to issue and Detective Taylor
was at once. dispatched to take the
lawyer into custody. â¢
, Collins appeared pale and careworn
when'he returned to the Hall, of Jus
tice with Detective Taylor and when he
was taken up to the, prison he said to
the desk sergeant,* ;â¢! am here to give
myself up." He appeared much crest
fallen as he made the remark. He was
booked on the charge of bigamy and
Detective Taylor gave, him over to a
deputy sheriff. He was taken to the
court of Judge Lawlor, where the in
dictment was read. "The charge of ' the
Grand Jury ; is as follows : >
JURY'S INDICTMENT.
George D. Collins was indicted for
bigamy by the Grand Jury yesterday.'
His arrest followed, but after being
booked at the City Prison he was im
mediately released bn $3000 bail; the
amount Judge Lawlor had fixed. Dep
uty-Sheriff F. J. Coyle and Detective
Thomas ' Gibson succeeded in serving
Mrs. Sarah McCurdy, mother of the
latest Mrs. Collins, with a subpena
yesterday morning to appear^in the
case before the Grand Jury. She ig
nored the process, however, doing so
on the . advice of Collins. Detectives
are still besieging the house at 1 118
Sacramento street in the hope of, cap
turing "Mrs. McCurdy, so that the
Grand Jury may take, her testimony

,the unhappy benedict.
As an Object of Curiosity
and With Law's Heavy
Hand on Him; He Begins
to Show Signs of Worry
CEOWD GATHERS AT
LAWYER'S NEW HOME
When French left yesterday after
noon for Sacramento an authentic bail
bond for $5000, the amount required,
accompanied him. It was given by the
Paul M. Nippert Company, agents for
the Aetna Indemnity Company of 421
California street, on $2500 subscribed by
J. Levy Sr. of the Crossley building and
the baiance by Mrs. French.
Judge Lawlor held that the prisoner
might be released on a bond procured
here, as the jurisdiction of the Supe
rior Court extended throughout the
State. He added, however, that it
would be better for French to be re
leased by the court having jurisdiction
where the indictment was filed, and or
dered French into the custody of Dep
uty Sheriff .Reese by dismissing the
writ.
Seymour presented a return of the
writ, which held forth that the Deputy
Sheriff was not acting as a Sheriff's
officer, but in the capacity of agent for
the withdrawing bondsman, J. W. Wil
son of Sacramento. He then proceeded
to show the regularity of the Sheriff's
act in arresting French. Collins waived
argument on that question, and said
that the purpope of the writ was to
obtain a decision from the court as to
whether his client must return to Sac
ramento to be released on bail procured
here, or whether Judge Lawlor, as a
member of the Superior Court, could
not order French's release.
In the meanwhile District Attorney
Seymour had taken the train for Sac
ramento, arriving at the capital late at
right. He was informed that the dep
uty had wired the Sheriff's office of the
T.rit and that the Judge had continued
the hearing until Saturday noon to
give the District Attorney an opportu
nity to present his side of the case.
Seymour boarded an early train yester
day and was on hand when Judge
Lawlor called the case.
BACK TO SACRAMENTO.
Friday afternoon, just as the Sheriff
was preparing to take French to the
train, Collins served him with a writ of
habeas corpus to appear with his pris
oner before Judge Lawlor at 8 o'clock
the tame evening. The writ ordered
him to show cause why French should
not be released on bail procured here
â¢without proceeding to Sacramento.
George D. Collins, attorney for ex
fienator French, failed yesterday to
persuade Judge Lewlor to grant the re
lease of French on a ball bond procured
In this city. Deputy Sheriff Ed Reese
*as awarded the custody of the pris
oner and he took him to Sacramento
yesterday on the 2:30 o'clock train.
The argument over the writ of habeas
corpus and the issuance of bonds here.
Involving the release _of French with
cut his proceeding to Sacramento, oc
cupied but a few minutes of Judge
Lawlor's time. District Attorney Ar
thur Seymour of Sacramento was on
band tÂ« urge that the prisoner be taken
to Sacramento to be released on bail,
find won his case.
"The Review makes the act public in
order, that this sensible and generous
deed of good citizenship may have its
imitators. The association's regular
income exceeds $1300 a month, and it
could use $13,000 to the advantage of
the city if it had the money. There
are many things it would like to do
for the material and political progress
of San Francisco; which, however wise
and promising, are beyond its purse
at present. In the meanwhile funds
are needed for mere defense of civic
decency and the protection of the city,
and there is probably no way in which
it could be more wisely and effectively
used to that end than by intrusting it
to the Merchants' Association."
The foregoing is a quotation from
a full-page article. In continuation,
the official organ of the Merchants'
Association says:
"As soon as the public work begins
that was provided for by the bond is
sue it will be necessary for the asso
ciation to disburse money still more
liberally In order to carry out its
pledge to the public to see that the
work is honestly done. There must be
a great- deal of expert supervision and
there may be need of more injunction
suits and other litigation to "secure
proper, performance of contracts. Such
duties, which no private individual and
no other organization seems in a po
sition to undertake, fall peculiarly to
this body.
The Merchants* Association has
found "an angel, "* as he .would be
styled in theatrical parlance. He has
anonymously given $000 in shining
$20 gold pieces to help the associa
tion in its work. He is nqt a member
of the association. He visited Presi
dent Symmes, gave him the coin and
pledged 1 him to secrecy concerning his
â¢identity. >;
\u25a0 Yesterday the Merchants' Associa
tion Review was issued and on its front
page it has a picture of the donated
coin arrayed on a Blab. On the same
page it is set forth that coming at this
time the donation is peculiarly accept
able. "Moreover, .the time is coming
when such contributions will be badly
needed," the Review, continues. "Con
tributions to objects of especial value
in the business community have made
large drafts and recent litigation in the
form of injunction suits and criminal
prosecutions necessary, to check the
wholesale demoralization of local ad
ministration have added their ' share
to the burden for attorney fees, court
1 costs, detective services and items of a
similar character."

The match between the Talagoo and
San Francisco lacrosse teams that was
to have taken place this afternoon on
Charles Clark's polo field at San Mateo
has been called off. P. Lyons.manager
of the Talagoos, has resigned his po
sition and the team is not ready. A
new club will be formed, as many
etrong players live In and near San
Mateo. The first regular match for
the championship of the California
Lacrosse Association will be played on
Sunday, the 21st lnst., between the
Olympic and San Francisco teams on
the Presidio athletic grounds.
Tho Capital Lacrosse Club of
Ottawa has one of the strongest teams
in Canada and entertains high hopes
of capturing- the championship this
year. In this hope, the old players
ar* gtaylne In the team, which is made
up of the tame men as last year's
twelv*. The Shamrock team of Mon
treal also consists of exactly the same
players as it did in 1904. The Capi
tal and Shamrock teams will play-rat
the Dominion n^Bxposltlon, to be held
at NÂ«w Westminster, B. <X, In Sep
tember. The Capital team Is " almost
certain to extend Its western trip to
Ean Francisco, and it la probable the
Shamrock twelve will come also. If
these teams com* here, people in this
city will hare an opportunity of seeing:
as fine exhibitions cf lacrosse as can
be seen anywhere in the world.
The schedule of the California La
crosse Association for the season,* as
It was at first drawn up, provided for
a series of eighteen matches, ten to be
played In this city and the remaining
eight, in Ean Mateo. Some of the
members thought the number "of
matches too great, as a -Canadian
schedule consists of only about twenty
games. A programme providing fewer
matches has been arranged.

- Oscar 'Grkham took all the flight out
of the 'Angel band in the
spasm yesterday at Recreation Park
by swinging on a fast one and clouting
it out'to;the.lef t garden for, a couple of
bags, Buck Francks with ; the
only one: for the afternoon. It was one
of those ' old-time \u25a0 hits that Oscar used
to line out informer daj-s, and he made
himself fright* with ; a bunch of his old
admirdra, with ..that wallop. Scoreâ
! Oakland l,? Los Angelee 0.
Baum iad * another of those numer
ousÂ£har"luck days. He pitched good
enough ball to win iany, kind of a game
in any; man's 'league, but Dame For
! tune^. would not stop on her . rounds.
Several times the Angels could have
broken .'up , the game with a -hit, but
Graham was always there with the big
twists, and hits did not come through
any too often.' : ' ,
Francks' started off the seventh by
driving, out a fast one over short. Just
' then the venerable Peter Lohman ap
peared on the coaching line attired in
his fighting clothes. It was the first
time , the old gladiator showed on the
field of action this season, and the fans
let- out a few yells. They were sure
Peter's appearance was a good omen,
and their dope was right, though- it
did not look: the part for a moment. ...
| Byrnes .' followed Francks, and 'the
best 1 he ha 4 was a pop fly that Heine
Spies jj gobbled. \u25a0 When Graham came to
the plate the fans pleaded for "one . of,
those ancient swats. Oscar heard and
lined the first good one out over Ross'
head for : two stations, while Francks
tore over the . sacks and registered the
"lone run. s . *
The Angels looked desperate In the
ninth, for. with one gone Smith swung
through \to right with a resounding
two-sacker. Neither Dillon nor Cravath
had a hit in his bat, so the royal
chance to tie up the score fell by the
wayside. . I. _
â¢ In two other | Innings, the third and
the: fifth, the Commuters gleaned a
couple of bingles from the offerings of
Baum, but the young man always had
the next batter on his staff. \u25a0 Francks
made the only error of the game when

Scarcely less interesting was the in

rteeplechase, which had a gross value
of $12,000, of which $10,500 went to the
winner, Good and Plenty. Summary:
NEW YORK, May IS.â lt was Bel
mont day at Belmont Park to-day.
Three races were won for August Bel
mont, chairman of the Jockey Club,
by horses bred at his Kentucky farm,
"The Nursery." With Blandy he won
the Withers stake, one of the classics
of the American turf. With Tiptoe he
yon the Fashion stake, which is one
cf the most noted of the filly stakes for
two-year-olds, and with Crossways he
%yon an overnight event. The total
money won by Belmont's horses was
$10,500. This cut no figure, however,
compared with the pleasure it gave
their owner when, one after the other,
he saw his horses, the produce of stal
lions and mares for which, in some
cases, he had paid fabulous prices,
come home in front of their fields.
ST. LOUIS. May 13.â Lubin, 15 to
1, surprised the talent to-day by win
ning the Mississippi Valley selling

â¢'"Whiskey King took up the ; reins of

Petaluuia hariciicap over a mile at Keri-
! - yesterday- 'before the
largest crowd of the "meeting. The
gY&hd "stand" was ' fillea/Svith the . fair
sex, <country teams . and automobiles
were conspicfuous about the course and
\u25a0 the betting ring wore quite a metropol^
! itan air. ; : Two favorites were success
ful, Edinborough and .The . Lieutenant,'
each sporting the colors of Harry
Sto%-er. , : . ".V:',
For once Whiskey King faced the
barrier without being considered a
good 'thing. Previous time ! out thfe old
rogue rah disappointingly, and yester
day his odds; went to 9 and 10 to 1.
Hugh McGowan opened favorite, -but
caught only' a | sputtering -play. : - The
real piece of calico appeared to be Ro
maine; carrying. 110 pounds, equal
weight with Whiskey. King, which
commanded stury support, " both ; at
Petaluma and in the city poolrooms.,
At the post Whiskey King performed
his customary war dance, getting away
last of the bunch. Then, rushing into
the lead on the first turn, Herbert rat
ed him nicely and gradually shaking
off Ocyrohe he won handily fromVthe
Coffey entry in 1: 42%. Wright rode Ro
maine for all he was worth, finishing a
moderate third.
The ether winning outsiders were
Rosebud, Lily Golding and Auto Hood.
Lily Golding, which took the third
event, was ' bid up from $400 to $600 by
Bill Carroll,, trainer of the Napa Stock

The Mission "High School baseball
players went down to defeat. before the
aggregation from Lowell -High School
yesterday by; a score of â¢tos at the
Prealtlio Athletic. Groxjnds in one of the
most ; peculiar games of ball ever seen
among "prep" teams."
Mission opened fire upon.Roncovieri,
the. Lowell twirler, <In the first inning,
scbringtthree runs. '. Roncovieri .wasim
mediat^y replaced by Captain Johnson,
who in turn allowed two more tallies.
At -this point Mission fell off, making
costly errors. .Lowell was quick to take
advantage of the break \ in the'-oppo
nents' play, and buncheof hits in the
second and fifth Innings andy tied the
score. - â¢ J
During the remainder of the game
Mission failed to tally. This was due
to the fine work-of the, Lowell outfield
and the \u25a0* throwing of Catcher Cerf to
second base. The game was one of the
"hit or^miss" order from beginning to
end. The victory puts Lowell at the
head of the percentage column In the
sub-league, with Lick, Polytechnic and
Mission tied for second place. The
number of hits made bordered on the
absurd, and errors were everywhere
evident. .".,-- - .-" .-
Mission has a tie to play off with
Lick and also a game with Polytechnic,
both of which will* go hard with the
pink and green if they have such re
versals of form as â that of yesterday.
The Lowell and Mission teams lined up
as follows:

system under which a fleet has had its
headquarters at Halifax or Bermuda,
substituting for this fleet a large flying
squadron in touch with other waters,
and leaving, only -two or three British

due to the accidental discharge of a

INDIANAPOLIS. May 13,â 8y a suit
filed In the Superior Court to-day Phi
lander H. Fitzgerald and Frank N.
Fitzgerald and Harry A. Fenton, offi
cers and directors of the American Tri
bune New Colonjr Company, â¢ are
charged with collusion to defraud and
with converting to their own use $300,
000. . The company, the complainant
states, was organized in March, 1901,
with the purpose of buying lands in
Oklahoma and founding a colony.
However, alleges the complaint, suit
able land could not be found in Okla
homa, and the directors bought a tract
of land in Archer County, Texas. The
value of the land, it is charged, did not
exceed $55,000. and it is alleged the di
rectors notified the stockholders that
$300,000 was paid for the property.
Early advices are that the coming
crop, to be pressed in December, wtlll
be to some extent smaller than the
past one. Hot and dry weather, in ex
cess of previous years, is given as the
primary cause for this condition. Rain
is badly needed at this time to Insure
a good crop.'
The crop of 1902 was the largest yield
of the past decade, it being estimated
that 40.000.000 arrobas (178.520.000 gal
lons) of. oil were pressed in the pro
vinces of Cordoba, Jaen. Seville. Gra
nada and Malaga. Dry weather during
the period in 1903 when the olive was
ripening caused much of the fruit to
mature early and fall from the trees.
In this manner a considerable amount
of the crop was ruined, with the result
that the quantity of oil pressed in thÂ«
latter part of the year was approxi
mately one-third less than thafof the
previous year, and in almost, exactly
this proportion were the sales to Amer
ican houses decreased. A comparison
of consular invoice figures show the
exports to the United States for the
nine months ended September 30, 190J
and 1904, to have been as follows: 1903,
21.082 barrels, valued at $494,633; 1904,
14.253 barrels, valued at $323,387.
Prices. vary but little from one year
to another. $150 per ton being the usual
figure. The olive oil exported from
Malaga is of the class used for manu
facturing purposes and never for table
use.
The olive oil production of Spain, ac
cording to United States Consul Birch,
at Malaga, is on the wane. He reports
in October last as follows: After two
successive seasons of almost unprece
dented yields of olives in Andalucla.
the crop of this province and of the
surrounding provinces has resumed or
dinary proportions. Coincident with
the reduction of the size of a season's
production follows as. a natural se
quence a falling off in the exportation
of olive oil, though but 10 per cent of a
season's yield finds its way into for
eign markets.
Exports to the United States for 1904
Fell Off Heavily â Still Less
- for ldOs.
The makers realized that if their
trade was to survive they must take

cost of manufacture and develop new

sary and fortunately the fiscal system
of Great Britain gave to the makers
opportunities in this respect superior to
those of any other country. Thus eight

In a sounder position than it ever has
been before.â New York Herald.
Broker Say That Exports for 1904
Exceed Any for Nine Years
Past.
An interesting contribution to* the
fiscal controversy Is given by a firm of
well-known tin plate brokers in their
report on the industry for last year.
British exports, these brokers state,
show a record Increase over 1903 and,
although the total quantity was not
itself a record, it is higher than It has
been for nine years.
Great Britain's largest customer took
40, per cent more than in 1903. Prices
rose steadily during the year. The
works now are rin full swing and 1905
shows signs of being another good year.
1 This improvement; it is oÃserved,
may In a sense be said to date from
the adoption of tÂ»e McKinley tariff iri
America in 1896. The Welsh tin plate
manufacturers* at -the time feared the
tariff would kill their trade, but in
stead it proved a blessing in disguise.
The hardening process is the inven
tion of a Frenchman, *A: de la Bastie.
Hardened glass presents euch difficul
ties of manufacture that only simple
objects can be ! produced with such
economy that the price is not .an ob
stacle to their sale. '
The consequence is that, with the ex
ception, of a few unimportant special
ties, only two articles are manufac
tured at the present time. These are
dishes of agatine and tumblers of hard
ened glass.
The term "unbreakable glass" is an
exaggeration, but there - have been
plates of agatine ware hurled from
one end â¢of ~ a Jarge storeroom to the
other over a cement floor without dam
age. .; This experiment was repeated
several times without the slightest in
dication of cracking or chipping. But
the article which on account of its form
Is the ! most convenient to ] manufacture
and. which has no rival in its power of
resistance 18 the tumbler, in all its
forms * and shapes, as used daily by
millions of persons in cafes, hotels and
barrooms. \ .
, A report made some time ago by
United States Consul , â¢ McNally \at
LieÂ§:e,, Belgium, of the unbreakable
glassware made by a' firm in. that city
has attracted' v world- wide \u0084a ttention,
and it has been necessary for that gen
tleman to make a supplementary report
on the matter, covering the inquiries
which have reached him from all parts
of . the globe. It .- is rather surprising
that' a thing which should command
such a general interest could have been
carried on. so long without being dis T
covered, .for this particular industry
has thrived in a small way for twenty
five years. ' The reason that it is not
better known Is probably because of the
increased cost of- this material, but it
is contended that, while the first coat
is greater thanlthat of ordinary glass
ware, it is in the end much cheaper, as
it is almost everlasting.'

The death of Harry Grady at Provi
dent Hospital to-day added another fa
tality to the list attributed to the
teamsters* strike. Grady and his
brother William were called to th>
rear of their home in the night, and
\u25a0without, apparent provocation shot. A
In addition to refusing the demands
cf the team owners association, the
teamsters' Joint council to-night took
action that may cause a general strike
cf all the carriage and hearse drivers
In the city. The Liverymen's Associa
tion, an organization of employers, re
quested the council to order the dri
vers to deliver passengers at their des
tination instead of stopping at some
distance from a store. The council re
fused to do this, and announced that
If the liverymen did not recede from
their position a peneral strike of all
drivers. Including hearse drivers, would
be called.
The ice dealers of Chicago, who have
been requested by the Icemen's Union
to grant an Increase of* $10 a month,,
to-night decided to refuse the de
mands. They have offered to pay the
same wages as heretofore and make
an agreement for two years. A strike
Is expected.
Stones were thrown at non-union
drivers who delivered coal to the Car
ter 11. Harrison School, Twenty-third
place and Wentworth avenue, to-day.
Six policemen escorted the wagons.
Crowds of school children stood on the
corners asserting they would not go
to school Monday. Notwithstanding
the stone throwing, the coal was de
livered. No arrests were made. -
VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE.
Members of the teamsters' council
announced after their meeting that
they confidently expected that the
strike would now spread until it In
volved every union teamster In the
city. **â¢<*:
The arguments in the meeting of the
teamsters' joint council when the ques
tion of acceding or denying the pro
position of the Team Owners* Associa
tion was up for settlement were at
tiroes heated, but only on the question
cf whether or not it was advisable to
call a genral strike of all the 35.000
teamsters in the city or allow the em
ployers to force such a condition by in
sisting upon deliveries to boycotted
houses. The latter plan was finally de
cided upon, and a messenger was at
once sent to inform the members of
the Team Owners' Association that if
they made deliveries to houses employ
ing non-union teamsters their men
\u25a0would be called out at once. The team
owners had expetted this reply and
announced that they were prepared to
accept the situation. They will com
mence at once to make deliveries on
Monday, and any driver \Vho declines
to take goods to any place where he is
crdered to take them will be discharged
Immediately.
STRIKE WILL SPREAD.
The number of men now out Is about
4500 and it is expected that the strikers
that are 6ure to go out next week will
more than double this number. It
means that practically all of the truck
drivers in the city will be on strike
within a few days and that deliveries
between many houses not now affected
Uy the strike will be cut on*. There Is
\u25a0Jso great danger that the city's supply
cf food may be seriously"- curtailed for
the reason that the members of the
Team Owners' Association do the
major part of the hauling for the com
mission houses in South Water street,
through which passes the city's supply
ef fresh vegetables.
deliver goods.
Among the Team Owners' Associa
tion are the largest firms In the city
â¢ngaged in the transportation business
Â«.nd some of them employ several hun
dred teamsters. The members of the
association have the contracts in large
measure for the hauling of goods be
tween the large business houses in the
City and the railroads and they have
heretofore sided â¢ with the teams
ters rather than with the members of
the Employsrs' Association. They de
cided last night, however, that they
could no longer refuse to make such
deliveries and when the Teamsters'
Union refused to agree to this the mat
ter was laid over one night, to be
placed before the joint council of the
teamsters. This body having decided
to-night that no deliveries shall be
made by union men the situation has
reached a point where practically all
of the team owners in the city are
lined up against the Teamsters* Union.
FOOD SUPFL.Y THREATENED.
CHICAGO, May 13.â The strike of
teamsters is expected to spread rapidly
during the next week. At a meeting
held to-night between the teamsters'
Joint council, which is the governing
body of the local unions of the teams

Team Owners' Association the latter
Informed the representatives of the
teamsters that the conditions of their
business made it necessary for them
to make deliveries to houses which
fcave been boycotted by the unions and
that they would do bo next week, heed
less of the fact whether or not a strike
existed at such place. The council was
crged to agree to this procedure and
avert a general strike.
After an extended debate among its
members the teamsters' council'de

delivery ot goods to any of the boy
cotted houses by union teamsters and
that strikes would be called* whenever

NEW YORK, May IS. â The Financier
says: The features of the official state
ment of the New York Associated
Banks. this week were an increase, in
stead of the looked-for contraction In
loans; a moderate loss of cash; an in
crease In deposits and consequently in
the reserve requirements ' - and a de
crease in the surplus reserve very
nearly corresponding in amount with
the previous week's gain in this item.
The increase in loans was chiefly, due
to syndicate operations. The require
ments of speculation on the Stock Ex
change were much ! too small, because
of general market" depression, to ac
count ,for any augmentation in. bor
rowing.
The loss in cash resulted almost
wholly from sub-treasury operations

The scores follow:
j . The final match was by far the best
jof the , day. Harold Gabriel! and H.
Long were the contestants. Young Ga
briel, who is the cleverest player in the
I city for his years, found Long a trifle
'\u25a0 too "strong for him. Gabriel, as usual,
I started with a rush ' and annexed the
i first set; by a 6-4 score. Long showed
to advantage in* the second set, which
he won with the loss of but one game.
; The third set was the turning point of
the match and by far the closest of the
i four. Long won it by a score of 8-6.
i The nearest Gabriel came; to winning it
was 5-6 and 40-0, but Long ran out the
i.Bet. Gabriel seemed discouraged after
.losing the third set, and made a poor
, showing. in the fourth, which went to
i Long, 6-1. .
Both tournaments were played onthe
California ; Club courts. ' Six^ schools
were represented, ' three from each' side
of the bay. The Alameda County repre
sentatives were completely' outclassed,
and failed to win a set. Powell of
Berkeley High played two close N sets
v/ith H. Long, but the latter, did not let
himself out.
The contestants in the finals of both
events were ; from Lowell and Lick.
Lowell Â§ was represented by\ ; the Long
brothers, who won the doubles cham
pionship two weeks ago. The ; players
from Lick, were. Gabriel and Hotchkiss.
In the finals of the second tournament
M. Long was beaten in straight sets by
Hotchkiss.

Will Leaye Mare Island To-Morrow.
The navy training ship Lowton . is
scheduled to leave Mare Island to-mor
row ,en route to Asiatic ' waters. She
takes marines and sailors from Mare
Island and Terba Buena* to Join the
Government , of _the Asiatic
squadron. _ The i: men are , going to fill
the places of men. whose terms are now
expiring. ; The Liawton was formerly in
the army transport service, 1 but ; some
time since was converted into ' a train
mgship. '.*
They Claim That Strange Odor Clings
to Battlefields Where Many
Men Are Slain. .
One of the jackies of the battleship
Massachusetts, ! speaking of the acci
dent on board his ship, was heard [to
ask a visitor If he noticed a pronounced
odor of powder. The visitor answered
that he did, and wondered mildly why
there should be ;an odor of powder
when the 'accident had been caused by
aoi explosion of steam only.
"That's one of the things which can
not be accounted for," replied the
Bailor, "but it's what we. all call
'deaths aftermath.' Have you ever
heard of the persistency with which
the odor of powder clings to a battle
field after an encounter with the en
emy?
"Well," he continued, "this ", odor
clings to the field of strife in propor
tion to the number of those killed. It's
impossible to account for it, but those
who know declare that if there are a
great many killed \u25a0in the , battle ,'the
smell of powder clings to the spot for
days after, while if only a few are
killed it soon disappears. It's the same
when death is the result of any kind of
an explosion. , But it mnÃt-b> on ex
plosion. ."-.' ;-"-'\u25a0> >
"The fact that the .. odor â¢ clings to a
battlefield can be .easily, accounted for;
but why it should be present \u25a0 when . a
foreign agent has caused the explosion
no one cant account for. We won't
get rid of this smell until we get out to
gea. Ain't It funny?" concluded the
tar. \u2666
The visitor shook his bead and ad
mitted that it ;wa*.â Exchange.

This country Imports somÂ« 40,000
pounds of thyme oil, which is made
from the ordinary thyme of old New
England gardens, while great Quanti
ties of the leaves are used for culinary
purposes. The commercial growing of
thyme â¢on a small scale, the Agricul
tural Department thinks, should prove
a profitable Industry, especially as a
side Issue In gardening cr farming
where land Is cheap and plentiful.
Shortage In the supply of snakeroot
has sent prices soaring in this country^"
and promises to make its cultivation
profitable.
Fair prices are quoted in the drug
trade for dock and dandelion roots and
the cultivated varieties are so much
superior to those found growing wild
j that there Is said to be big money In
supplying them.
GROW IX THE OLD WORLD.
All of these plants grow in Europe
and some In Asia, but there they are
carefully gathered and cured. More
than that, not only is the local tradÂ©
supplied, but great - quantities are ex
ported to-, other countries, our own
among them. *
"The growing of drug plants," ex
plains Dr. True, "if practiced in the
United States sufliciently to supply the
demand would give employment to con
siderable areas of fertile soil located
within easy reach of transportation,
; lines-.
! "This class of land Is now devoted
;to other crc-ps. The returns from drug
i plants to the farmer, I believe, how
ever, would be much greater. Whether
or not such is the fact is now to be de
termined by actual experiment.
"The best method of procedure must
also be established' by experiment.
Every possible labor-saving device la .
to be employed . for the purpose of re
ducing cost to a minimum. As yet.
however, our efforts are hardly begun.
"As a result of such study of the
situation as has thus far been made.
j the Southern ' States, it , would seem,
offer the best advantages for the pros-^,
pective grower of drug 3. -The long sea
j son required by many such plants,* the
low price of labor and the usual low
price of land needed are found there."
â Chicago Chronicle.
Some of these plants are classed as
cumbersome weeds and are even now
uprooted and thrown out of the land,
although, did agriculturists only real
ize it, they are very valuable.
At one time golden seal, for Instance.
was so abundant in the East that it
was torn up and burned by farmers
to keep it from overrunning their fields.
But to-day it 13 worth 75 cents a
pound wholesale in the market and
it is eagerly hunted for by drug plant
collectors. There are scarcely 150.000
pounds collected annually in this coun
try and the actual demand is several
times this amount.
This "poison farm," as it Is called by
facetious neighbors, is situated on the
Potomac flats, just outside the city
limits of Washington. In a test gar
den, conducted there by Dr. Rodney
T. True, physiologist in charge of drujr
and medicinal plants investigations of
the Agricultural Department, large
plots have been laid out for the culture
of opium poppy, nightshade, belladon
na, licorice, capsicum, caraway, anise,
coriander, burdock, dandelion, fox
glove, pokeweed, mullein, lobelia, tan
sy, gum plant, boneset. fleabane, bless
ed thistle and Jimson weed.
OFTEN CLASSED AS WEEDS.
The early pioneers considered their
herb and medical gardens of prime. Im
portance, but with the development of
medicine, and particularly in the es
tablishment of the Ã¼biquitous drug
store, this practice fell Into disuse.
There was no need to raise your own
medicinal plants. They could be ob
tained much easlervand at little ex
pense at the apothecary's.
So medicinal gardens were abandon
ed;, the drug plants, particularly the
poisonous ones, growing In the fields
were rooted out as noxious weeds.
"With the disappearance of the forests
went many more. Bfi
And now the United States, once so
rich in drugs, finds herself in the pe
culiar position of sending $16,000,000
abroad. each year for what she threw
away at home.
Why does such a condition exist?
Why should not all the drugs we need
be raised right here at home?
Government experts are busying
themselves with a practical answer to
this problem.
In other, words, they have started an
experimental farm near Washington,
upon which they are trying to' deter*
mine whether or not drug plants can
be grown in America upon a commer
cial scale.
Time was when the United Startes
raised all, or nearly all of the drugs
used within its borders. They grew In
the forests, *in the fields, they cum
bered the land. -.

THE SGHOONER 3^.3^C^A.R.
Gives Port a Surprise.
The new British steamship Camosun,
bound from Troon, Ireland, to Van
couver, B. C, unexpectedly put in " an
appearance In port late yesterday aft
ernoon. She crossed the bar at full
speed and did hot come to an an
chorage, until she landed up midway
between Alcatraz ! Island - and ' Terba
Buena Island, having passed the quar
antine line as though It, had never ex
isted. The quarantine boat, the cus
toms'boat Golden Gate and ' launches
from every boathouee dashed out into
the bay jto board the stranger'and-as
certain what brought her \u25a0 here. Visions
of mutiny, lack of lack of
water 'and similar suggestions were
passed along the line on the- water
front.
Captain C. J. Smith, her commander,
explained that_ he had ' been longer on
the run than "fie expected, and thought
as this was the maiden trip of the ves
sel she might need, some repairs, and
possibly she might need to be dry
docked. He thought the work could
be better attended to here than up
north. This was the reason he gave
for coming to port.
The Camosun was launched in Feb
ruary of this year. She was built. at
Glasgow, Scotland, for the Union
Steamship Company of Vancouver, B.
C, . and is Intended to run between
that port and Skagway. She has ac
commodations for 350 passengers and
400 tons of freight. She Is comfortably
arranged and is a valuable acquisition
to the coast *fleet. She Is 793 tons reg
ister. On her trial trip she made 13%
knots. She was 84 days from Troon, 74
days from Dublin, 33 days from Sand
Point and 23 days from ; Coronel. She
steamed an average of ten knots .per
hour on the trip. The weather was
generally fair.
The "vessel , will remain' ln port until
Gordon T. Lake, the managing owner,
advises Captain Smith what he .wishes
to have done to the ship. .
Warren Sails.
The transport Warren sailed for Ma
nila late yesterday afternoon. She left
her dock at 1 o'clock and then sailed
around the bay testing her compasses.
Some rumors were started along, the
front that' a portion of/ her crew had
deserted her Just at the hour of sail
ing. Inquiry at the \u25a0 transport dock
proved that .the rumor was ; entirely
without foundation. ' \ >iV;
The four-masted schooner Samar has
made what is supposed' to be the quick
est run down the coast on record. She
made the trip from Puget Sound to
Redondo in five days, loaded with a
big cargo of lumber. -The vessel" is
three years old and has made ' several
smart runs before. She la owned by
Kirschman & Sanders.;'

CELEBRATED VIOLINIST
REACHES SAN FRANCISCO
. The advent of Charles Ertz in this
city is eagerly looked for by many men
engaged in the oil industry in Califor
nia. Ertz is.the president of the Bulls
head Oil Company, which has a refin
ery at' Martinez.' He went East to sell
bonds that "the company might have
money to use in certain operations In
which it is engaged, and the rumor is
that he has succeeded largely, and that
he tias coin for all present uses.
Interest has been centered more or
lest on a transaction that has taken
pla- c during Krtz's absence. He is now
reported to be on his way home from
the East, and' is expected to arrive at
his place of business, on California
street, not later than Tuesday of the
present week.
Ertz is one of many who have tried
\u2666o carry or* an oil business independent
of the Standard Oil Company, and, so
the story g'X's. has incurred the enmity
of tnc great corporation by such at
tempt. When he started to sell oil he
found all sorts of obstacles that were
not anticipated, such as have become
Caxnliar to others under like circum
stances. .V few months ago Erts
bought five carloads of crude oil, and
had it shipped to Martinez. For some
reason the transportation charges were
not paid. This lact is evidenced by an
advertisement that appeared In the
Martinez Daily Gazette of May 11. The
advertisement was signed by S. Crilley,
agent of the Southern Pacific Company
at Martinez, in it the carloads^ of oil
previously mentioned were offered for
Â«-aJe, "or so much thereof as will pay
the freight and charge due on each car
end the expenses of sale."
The Southern Pacific Company and
the Standard Oil Company are popu
lary supposed to be working together
In the matter of controlling the*"oil in
dustry in California. The Southern Fa
cific Company is an owner of the stock
of the Associated Oil Company, and is
interested both in holding: the business
of the Standard Oil Company as a ear
lier and In obtaining fuel at a mini
mum price on its own account as a
consumer of the same in its engines.
In addition to the story that Ertz has
mad* a turn, there is a rumor that he
will return with some plan and some of.
the sinews of war with which the in
dependent oil companies can put up
come sort of a tight in their own behalf.
This ad<is to the interest in the arrival
cf Ertz and what may possibly happen.
It Is "Said That Standard
Company 3lethods Will
Be Subject of Attack
GETS COIX IX EAST
Kumored That He Has Some
Plan for Independents
to Put Up a Good Fight
