THREE MEN HOLD OUT
FIRMLY FOR ACQUITTAL
OF ACCUSED LAWYER
District Attorney Charges Di
rectly That Corruption
Secured Verdict. s
BODY IS DISCHARGED
The Jonr and tedlouÃ trial of Attormey Gtorjf D. Collins tor perjury
came to tsughl late last night, the Jury barla* disngrerd. All. day lonic
Jndgr- Lfanon did everything; within his power to Induce the twelve men
to reach n -verdict, nit hont avail. The balloting stood nine for conviction,
three for nequittal. At midnight the jury was dismissed. When District
Attorney Bylngton discovered that his many months' hard work bad met
with defeat his anger flamed high and he at once charged that the three
Juror* who had voted for ; acquittal had been influenced by dishonest mo
tive*. Shortly after the trial began there were rumors that three or four of
those upon whom the fate of the defendant rested would bear watching.
The disagreement emboldened the District .. Attorney to- make the direct
charge of dishonesty. Several of the nine Jurors who voted for conviction
questioned the motives of the three dissenters..
The District Attorney, made engry by
the alleged miscarriage of- Justice, does
â¢ rot hesitate to say that the evidence
ApaJnst tne accused attorney 1Â« absolutely
couclusive. Ilespecifies^with^veiremence
that no sensible man>could" find a pee
on which to hang a verdict of acquittal,
pointing out that the proof of guilt was
overwhelmingly convincing. -
He says there were" rumors from the
outset that some of the jurors had been
tampered with, and thinks that the ac
cusations of those who voted for con
viction, based on intimate contact and
argument with the, dissenting Jurors,
are worthy of credence and that the
charge that there was dihonesty should
be thoroughly investigated.
'juror makes de.yiai.. I
Juror Charles H. Hartley waa seen
at his home, 2828 Sixteenth . street, at
t o'clock this morning-, where he was
told of Bylngton's charges. He was
Â«l Indignant and combative, saying: "ilr.
FByington may think he Is doing his
duty by making these false charges to
\u25a0l newspaper. All I have to say is
that I went into that jury box un
der oath to do my duty and I saw a
â¢trong doubt of the def^dant's jjullt.
co I voted, as instructed, to give tho
defendant the benefit of the doubt,
Â«Bd the doubt was more than reason
able. If Byington has any charges to
make against me let him make thsm
through the proper channels and In the
regular way and I will meet them. I
was not approached by anybody: do
not think anybody else "was ap
proached, and I defy all such accusa
tions as to my honor and my motives "
Neither Hunt nor Hickman could be
found at 2 o'clock this morning. They
Hrere not home.
WEARY WAIT FOR VERDICT.
The solemn tones of the big clock in
the tower of the Hall of Justice had just
founded midnight when the jurors who
were chosen to decide the guilt or inno
cence of George D. Collins, charged with
perjury, announced to Judge Lennon that
fcfter thirty-two hours under lock and I
key. tnd after the taking of fourteen bal
lot* aad the use of interminable argument
they werÂ« unable to agree. The foreman.
Kcwton H. Hlckman, announced to Judge
I^ennon that the vote stood 9 to 3 during
the lest fifteen hours of debate, and that
a. thousand more ballots or thirty days
in the Jury room would not serve to move
It elnfle Juror from his stand,
k The verdict was received with elation
'by Collins. To Byington and to Hiram
Johnson It was a great disappointment,
fts more waa Involved in the case than
the mÂ«re securing of a conviction of the
*ccuse6 attorney. That Judge Lennon
was Jeaving no opportunity open for the
ebarcÂ« that he had been lenient and per
mitted the Jury to retire before . it had
been riven time to properly go over the '
Â«videncÂ«' was shown by the court's re
peated advice to the jury to return to
the room and endeavor to reach an agre</
xnent.
FIRST VOTE, SEVEX TO FIVE.
Shortly after the Jury retired Thursday
evening, a tentative ballot was cast.
There was no call for record or evidence,
and when the vote was counted it was
found that five Jurymen stood,for.acquit
tal, whilf seven held;out for conviction.
This remained unchanged during the
tedious hours of Thursday evening, and
when Judge Lennon ordered the jury to
the Palace Hotel the vote was still un
changed. - / '
At the hotel the discussion was again '
resumed, and it was not until 2:30 In the
tnorninsr that another ballot showed that
one man had gone' over to the side favor
lns conviction,. and the vote stood 8 to 4. â¢
During the early morning another ballot
was tak<-n in the Jury-room, with^the.re
sult that but three held out for. acquittal,
aiid these * three, , Newton H. Hlckman, :
Charles 11. .Hartley ; and James T. Hun- '
ter. remained impervjoufi to all argument !

Collins declares that under ' the j extradi
tion laws the -trial ;and â¢ disagreement
amount to an acquittal in the eyes of the
British law, and. that he cannot be tiled
again for perjury.' Under the extradition
no other charco can be placed against
him until the lapse of thirty ; days. After
that time, if he - has . not placed himself
on British soil' he can ;be apprehended
and prosecuted. -
J Collins says he -will depart for other
part* and carve .out a .career; far' from
the â¢ men he claims have persecuted him.
When the first announcement was made
by the jury of the failure to, agree. Col
lins' eyes lighted and he shot a quick
look of triumph at Byington and John
son. . ... â¢ \u25a0
It. was exactly twenty-four hours to
the minute when the Jurymen filed back
into the courtroom yesterday afternoon
in the afternoon and at the same time
their deliberations. They retired to the
Juryroom day before yesterday at \u25a0 4:40
in. the af ternon and .at the same time
yesterday they returned to their places
In the Jury box. '
Jn responEe to Judge Lennon's ques
tion as to whether they had reached
a unanimous decision,,- Foreman Hick
man said: "We have not reached a de
cision. We have deliberated carefully
and find an agreement an -Utter impos
sibility."
"Are you troubled by a question of
law?" queried the court.
"Xo, it Is more a difference of opinion
on a question of fact," was the reply.
"Is that your opinion. Air. Feintucht?'
asked Lennon.
"It is, your Honor. This jury can
not agree. At one time we wanted the
testimony brought in, but we afterward
judged it absolutely unnccessary.^There
are two strong factions opposing- each
other and it is useless to : expect an
agreement."
LEXXOX IS OBDURATE.
Mr. Hartley echoed these sentiments
and George H. Lux volunteered the In
formation that their opinion" would be
the same if they sat for a thousand
years. The. others coincided -with the
statements of their colleagues. : They
denied that any definition of law* or
elaboration of testimony waa neoei
sary. -- .
Judge Lennon thereupon said: "We
have been a long time trying this case.
You are no more anxious to get away
than I am. While you have been work- J
Ing here I have been working fn San
Rafael. lam inclined. to discharge you
if you will unanimously assure* me that
you cannot reach an agreement. If
there is any possibility of an agreement
I want you to reach: lt,".
Judge. Lennon > was then told that the
vote after nine ballots' stood 9 to 3 and
that If 100 ballots. were taken the:re
sult would not -be changed. -He was
assured thatUhe jury- seriously 'appre
ciated the . importance ' of Its - decision
and the , expense' borne by the city and*
county.' \u25a0
. .Collins ; then asked.' as . it â¢ seemed : that
5t was Impossible 'for. the Jury to; reach
an agreement...* that it .be discharged. 4
Judge Lennon,- however, demurred -and

TELLS GRAPHIC STORY.
Ilevolt of Russian* at Vladivostok De
nrrihed b> a Traveler.
VICTORIA. B. C. Dec. 22.â Henry Bush
of Clarkson &' Co., of . Vladivostok, Port
Arthur and Harbin,*, who arrived from
Vladivostok to-night by the steamship
Tarxir, was an eyewitness of the revolt
among the Russian soldiers there and he
tells a graphic story. The trouble began
at a Chinese bazar, where,; following a
dispute, a mob of soldiers rushed the
etails and grabbed everything they could
lay their hands on. Many Russians went
lo a streamer which was discharging oil,
obtained gallons of tha liquid and satur
ated the bazaar with It. They fired the
ylace and it burned quickly, many
wounded Chinese being Incinerated.
The commander, Katzoff, ordered out
the troops who were ,ln the barracks,
but instead of preventing the revolt the
soldiers began looting themselves.
Bush says they would not fire on the
revolting soldiers, although they were
quick enough to use their rifles to kill
Chinese. The mob brought can after
can of oil from the wharf and burned
the place. By this time the streets
were filled with screaming, mad Rus
sians and Chinese. The sticks and
stones were flying and bullets whistled
everywhere. Chinese corpses were scat
tered about the streets and many Rus
sians were killed.
Bush did not realize his danger until
some Chinese rushed at him with
Fhouts of "There's another one;" and
he fled. \u25a0 â¢ , . . ,
Bodies were scattered about the
streets, over 600 Russians and more than
2000 Chinese being killed. .The bodies
lay unburied for three days, when they
were gathered up â¢wholesale and carted
away for burial. :- -
"Returning to Vladivostok, Bush came
across body after body, sometimes scat
tered, sometimes in groups. ; .- The city
presented a sad appearance, being prac
tically ruined. He estimates the loss at
$20,000,000 and says years will be..re
quired to put the place as it was.

New York Life Company
NEW YORK, Dec. 22.â Additional
testimony as to the management of
the Mutual Life Insurance -Company
:Was adduced to-day by witnesses be
fore" the legislative committee on in
surance Investigation, tending to show
that* the. company used profits from the
sale of securities to conceal the * reduc
tion of book- values of real estate, or
losses, as Charles E. Hughes," counsel
to ! the committee. ; called them. '
' Francis - Hendrlcks. superintendent of
the State Insurance. Department, when
on the .witness stand yesterday, said
he had never heard of such a thing
and .that it had never, been called to
his attention. -To-day, after auditors
of the MutualLlfe had testified to this
fact, Isaac G. Vanderpoel. chief exam
iner, of \u25a0 the department, declared that
he had not discovered the matter in
his examination of the company last
year, when in his report he gave the
company what was : practically a cer
tificate of "good< character." He said
, these ' manipulations * "of . the figures
were"noÂ£ apparent. in the books.
These transfers of profits to the
debit side of the profit and loss ac
. count were made by the auditors upon
the instructions jof President McCurdy
â¢ and' Vice President Grannis and the
written instructions were produced.
'They 'named 'the figures that adjusted
vthÂ« aocounts.- â¢ Last year while there
.wasTreally a â¢profit of almost $1,500,000
', when these : transfers were made no
'\u25a0 profit ; whatever. was shown.
Vanderpoel said he had : examined
the* report of 1904, which showed no
profits from the sale of securities. Al
though-he knew this was untrue he
did not so report it, because he did not
think It was necessary.
The same situation existed In the
New York Life, according to Vander
poel, although the practice was not
general. ; When asked what he did in
the ;, matter he said. "Nothing." Van
derpoel said he had examined the
Hanover Bank account of the New
York Life In 1904 and did not find the
$100,000 that was paid to Andrew Ham
ilton. '
Vanderpoel never knew of the year
end. loans of- the Metropolitan Life to
Vermilye & Co. . and . never knew how
the company handled its collateral
loans. He said he never in an exam
ination of a company went back of its
ledgers.
Henry D.Appleton. second deputy In
\u25a0 the Insurance . Department, was on the
stand . a large part of the afternoon.
He testified to his duties and detailed
legislation that had been advised by
the department to control assessment
companies. . Appleton said that no
more attention is. paid, to the state
ment of a New York company than is
paid, to the statement of a company
incorporated; in any other State. He
said no actual inspection Is made of a
report unless an examination Is made.
V^The-. committed '- adjourned over
Christmas and will resume Its inves-'
tlgation next Wednesday. Sessions
then will be held up to and! Including
Saturday, which .will be 'the'last day
of the committee's Investigation.

self-inflicted, has admitted to the su

A few days since Powers wrote from
the Blue Grass State to Ehler In Ba

"I see Â«, by a press dispatch that you
may be an Important witness In tha
Goebel murder. For six years I have
lain in prison and three times I have
been sentenced to death- for a crime of
which! am as innocent as the angela
around the throne. It you have any
information that will, throw llsht on
the death of Governor .Goebel, then, for
God's sake, declare yourself and aid
In proving my innocence."
Ehler. on receiving this letter, per
mitted Superintendent Buckreus __ to
read it, and the latter, recognizing 'lts
Importance, questioned Ehler closely,
whereupon the latter admitted that ho
could . give testimony that wquld save
the. life of Powers and he intimated that
if the ex-Secretary's execution were
imminent he" would give such testl

And Ehler, who â¢i 3 wracked with a
pain, after a moment's study, bowed
his head.
"Then," said the superintendent, "in
God's name, why ' don't you declare
yourself?"
"Because it would Implicate others," \u25a0
thler replied.
"But you would not see an Innocent
man executed." said the official Indig
nantly. -- -. f
Ehler reflected for a moment and
said:
"Well, Caleb Power* isn't executed
yet." -..*â¢\u25a0, '
And thereupon he closed his eyes and
refused to say more. -
Powers has been notified of the ad
missions of the man now in the hos

It was shortly after" midnight on the
morning of December 7 last that Ehler
was mysteriously shot In front of thÂ«
Southern Hotel. He passed out of tha
corridor of the hotel and a few minutes
later a shot was fired, the bullet strik

it was Wade's? V
Well, my recollection of it, colored by
the imagery of childhood, was conjured
tip last night on beholding the ballroom.
In keeping with the beauty of the dance
was the music It wu danced to, six se
lections being heard In the West for the
first time. And this distinction was due
to the thoughtfulness of Miss Virginia
Jolliffe, who Bent them out from New
York last week.
Among the interesting visitors were
Mr. and Mrs. Waterbury, and Miss Duns
rcuir of Victoria, the latter a guest of
the Freemans, and incidentally an aw
fully smart looking little maid.
Well, I guess.
At 10:30 there weren't enough people
in the ballroom to make up a "set" for
a reel.
In spite of some puritanical knocking
by the nice old ladies who do the chap
erone act, the doors from the ballroom
Into the wide without were opened as
before â and there was much good cheer
tlcreat.
One more Greenway dance, and the
dances of '05 will be but memories.

"Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW -'YORK, Dec. 22. â Under a
scathing cross-examination to-day
Colonel Mann, the editor of Town Top
ics, who accuses Peter F." Collier , and
his son, the proprietors of Collier's
Weekly, and Norman Hapgood, the,ed
itorial writer, of criminal libel, told
of his business relations ;wlth Robert
A. Irving, who was arrested last week
on 'a charge of attempted blackmail
growing out of the "Fads and Fancies"
scheme. Colonel Mann was a reluctant
witness, and continually answered im
portant Questions with "I can't re
member." . .â¢
.The lawyer brought out the admis
sion that Mrs. Huntington's . subscrip
tion bad been made in two payments
of $5000 each in cash. .
'"I did not get a dollar of it," declared
Colonel Mann under a fire of questions.
"It was turned into Town Topics."
"Did you not tell the reporters that
you had a "cartload "of scandals that
would blow up New York if they were
printed?"
"As near as I can recall," answered
Mann, "I said that cartloads of scandal
ous matter wore coming to my office,
which I never used." .
Colonel, Mann admitted Irving had
obtained most olf the subscriptions to
"Fads and .Fancies.*'.; receiving a com
mission of 15 per cent, which may have
amounted in the aggregate to $15,000.
He declared' that he could not remem
ber having given to Irving- letters of
introduction to, Grb\*er Cleveland and
Frederick Gebhardt.. and. he denied he
had made statements about William Â«K.
Alfred, G. and Reginald Vanderbllt.
"Did you get the Vanderbilts as sub
scribers?" demanded Attorney Os
borne. . . . , *
Colonel Mann'again -protested that he
could not reme'mber,~whereupon the law
yer ordered him; to produce his lists. Col
onel-Mann, opened a copy of "Fads and
Fancies." ; '
"Did you regard" these contracts and
receipts ,as proper safeguards?"
â¢ Again a'longr wrangle followed, but
Colonel Mann finally answered: "Yes;
we did safegruard the. public, and I.
defy you to produce anybody who can say
that we did not fulfill our contracts."

ALARM OVER
SITUATION
IN CHINA
Deep Concern Felt
by the .State
Department,
Information* Said to Be
at Hand Which Is
Kept Secret
Intimation That the Japanese

Scecial Dispatch to The Call.
\ CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 22. â There is the
gravest concern in the State Depart
ment, over the Chinese situation and
the concern is deepening day by day.
The statements following the Shanghai
riots to the effect that the Sta*e De
partment officials were not infected
with the excitement that prevailed in
the European capitals over the matter
were true only in one sense. The ex
citement has been kept, under control,
but anxiety and apprehension are
present and the gravity of the situa
tion is only emphasized by the attempt
of the officials to hide their feelings.
China is being much discussed by the
American State authorities to the ex
clusion for the present of everything
else. It is known that there is a mass
of, intormation touching the rapidly
spreading Chinese hatred of the for
eigners in the possession of the de
partment, which It has not seen fit to
make public. The officials have cer
tain knowledge that, while the rioters
have directed their assaults Impartially
against all foreigners of white *skins,
the inciters of the riots have made a
special mark of the Americans, v
.' It is not so much for the. immediate
present that Secretary Root fears as It
is for. the future. The mere" matter of
a trade treaty with China has sunk
into insignificance in the face of the
fear that at any moment further
demonstrations may' be made against
foreigners In other parts of the em
pire as the news of the Shanghai riots
spreads.
The State Department has not fainm
to note that the Japanese residents of
China, who are, foreigners as far as the
Chinese Government Is concerned, have
been free from molestation. In this
they' see another significant thtng. and
ln-vlew of the^events of the recent past

WASHINGTON. Dec: 22.â Secretary
Root to-day announced that Third As
sistant Secretary Peirce of the State De
partment had been selected as the first
Minister from the United State* to Nor
way. He also confirmed the previous
announcement that David E. Thompson,
the former Minister to Brazil, was to
have the- post at Mexico City. It was
also given out that Lloyd C. Grlscom LÂ»
to become Embassador to Brazil- The
Embassadorship to Japan i* still left
open and so is the office of the third
assistant secretary ot the State Depart
ment. In the case of the latter, it was
admitted that the name of Charles Den
by as present chief of the departmÂ«nt
had been discussed for the place. It
may also be said that the general opin
ion here is that Denby will obtain the
office. He has had an extensive experi
ence In China, having been secretary to
his father when the latter was United
States Minister to China.
Several names have been mentioned to
the President for the post In Tokio. but
it is said that he has not yet made a
selection. John G. Leishmann. Minister
to Turkey, is prominent In the list and
It is said that the President looka kindly
upon him because of the work he has
doc* In Turkey against extreme odds.
Had the Turkish Government consented
to the raising of the legation to an em
bassy. It is probable that President
Roosevelt -would have given
the appointment. For this reason. It is
thought that Leishmann will be sent to
Japan.

MINING REGIONS
BECOMING ACTIVE
KLAMATHi BARS TAKEN
Tuolumne, Sierra and Inyo Counties
Have Good Times in Trdspect.
Encouraging information , concerning
California mining regions has been re
ceived during the last few days. Accord
ing to good' authority, great interest Is
manifested in the " mining outlook ; along
the Klamath River. Every . bar - and
bench along that stream is reported to
have been taken up. ' Next season,, it
is locally . predicted, . the mining activity
on ths Klamath will* exceed anything be
fore '\u25a0; known in that section, from the
crossing of the Southern Pacific Com
pany's line at Hornbrook â¢ for 100 miles
through Slskiyou County and Into Del
Norte and .- Humboldt counties.
The Tuolumne New Era reports con
cerning interest and the outlook in Tuol
umne County:
That portion of the 'great and famous east
bÂ§lt within the boundaries of Tuolumne County
Is advancing rapidly into an era that will
stand prominently at the head of all bright
and prosperous : periods in its history beyond
the possibility of a doubt^ | There are more
capitalists looking this way for .investment
now than- at any time In many years past. In
support of this statement several important
deals consummated within the last few montns
are pointed out and If thi3 ls not suf tlclent
a few more months,- perhaps only weeks, win
bring about changes that will help wonderfully.*
Concerning Sierra County mining ,the
Mountain, Messenger says: \u25a0 - ,/.-.
Advices are to {he effect \u25a0: that the storm :
of Thanksgiving week has not brought very
much relief to the districts affected by. the
lack or power from the drought.- Here and
there a mill or two has been started up,
but the shutdowns continue generally along
the mother lode, and to some extent in Nevada
County, The situation ls practically unchanged
in Sierra , County. The mines affected are
running on reduced forces, but otherwise the
status of mining' in both branches- is In- a
very satisfactory state. Underground develop
ment has not been Interfered with,- and Judg
ing from the amount of supplies that are be
ing sent out on pack animals from- Downie
ville to outlying-v mines operations are on
the increase. ...
Most of the mines have got their winter
supplies in. but there are: yet many which
are hoping that the clear i weather will con-, -
tinue a week or go longer in order that they |
may be able to get what they lack before
being snowed up .for the balance of the win
ter. Prospectors in many parts of tna dis
tricts are pushing assessment work on their
claims. Cheerful news-sioatinues to come in
from the southern belt. partlculaxly^from
Forest. American Hill, Alleghany and CJiipps
Flat. The South Fork gravel mine in Forest
ls showing up better all the time. The drifts
being run on the -gravel indicate a big de
posit, and wherever tested by panning show
good values. ' . ,
Nothing, has done so much for Forest in
many years as thÂ« big strike in this mine.
It has put fresh courage into miners owning
or developing other properties on the Big
Blue lead in the , Forest and contiguous dis
tricts. Outside money is coming In more
freely, I both for purchase and development.
Several deals are on the carpet and a num
ber of new companies are being formed
the- outside to take hold of old properties
and resurrect them. At Alleghany the Tight
ner is still in bonanza and the Ra nbow is
opening more good ground for action. At
Sierra City the new forty-stamp mM.o f. the
Sierra Buttes, or at least half of it,, will
undoubtedly be going again the coming week.
In fact everything looks lovely for this time
of year.
SMELTER ' IS PROPOSED.
Inyo County, is anticipating a large
benefit from the smelter that ls proposed
for Keeler. The Los Angeles Times says:
In Owens Blver Valley, in Inyo County,
whither are turned the eye 9 of all ' of v Los
Anxeles to. the. source of : the â¢ city's .. future
water supply, many Angelenos and others have
been attracted by tbe mining fever ; and are
seeking - the mineral -> wealth that - ties in thft
mountain range for miles around Owens Lake.
While the discoveries of Harris and^Mbnt
gomery in the Panamint have starteid &. boom,
heralded far and near, that is reopening old
mines and starting the development of pros
pects on all sides, the resrlon around Keeler
and along the line of the Carson and Colorado
Railroad is the seat of active development.
So far there have been* few wildcat proper
ties announced In this region. Most of the
companies now working are close corporations.
In years uone by considerable development
was carried on. Some good mines were ope
rated for silver and lead principally, . although
the ores carry some gold; then came -the
period of widespread depression in mining and
the owners shut down to await better. times..
One of the leading properties ls the Cerro
Gordo, formerly owned by D. O. Mills of .'the"
Southern Pacific. It was** the first to . attract
outside attention, owing to its great output,
it beln* credited with over $20,000,000, , al
though, :as with other mines, thousands of
tons were, left on the dumps on account of
beinar too low (trade to be handled by the
methods formerly used. ,
The capitalists who have purchased the
mine are preparing again to operate it. â¢â¢ The
new owners, under the name of the Great
Western Purchasing- and Reduction Company,
are building a. 100-ton smelter for custom
trade. "From last reports this is likely to be
completed during the early part of the com
lne year. \u25a0 . ' '"
The product of this. region is. an ideal smelt
ing ore. It is a silver-lead carbonate, running
very low in silicon and very high in iron and
limeâ juat the kind that emelters are crying
for and which they must, have in .order, to
work such highly silicious j ores as those 'of
Tonopah, thousands of tons of which are being
refused treatment by the. Salt Lake City
smelters for lack of eufflclent. flux, and , are
piling. up on the dumps while a market is be
ing souKht. Under the circumstances it la
likely that the operators of Tonopah ' will have,
to look to the mines of the Owens River Val
ley for relief. v . .... â.\u25a0 :

near the Sportsman'a Hall, to Thomas G. Pat
ton of Placerville for $30,000 for some San
Francisco' people who have had it examined by
John E. Sexton.
At the Pacific House, where a drill has been
in operation . for several - months, it ls said a
fine deposit of gravel has been located. At the
Snow mine at Newtown, which has recently,
been bonded to some New Jersey people, an in
cline several hundred feet long is being run
into the channel, which in that vicinity has al
ways been good.
The mines referred to here ara all in the

With Successive Failures
BAKERSFIELD. Dec. 22.â The theory
long rince advanced that a stratum of

heavy oil in the Kern River fields has
been practically exploded by development
work on the Grace Oil Company's lease.
For many months this company has been
engaged in sinking a deep well for the
purpose of securing tbe lighter oil which
it was believed existed. Early In the
week at a depth of 214S feet a large Quan
tity of salt water was struck, which
flowed up over the top of the casing. Tlu
water was struck in a stratum of sand
stone, which ls believed to be several hun
dred feet thick. After the' water had been
encountered the drill waa sent down
eighteen feet further, but as the water
increased in quantity, and as there was
not the slightest evidence of oil, the ef
fort to bring In a well of light oil was
abandoned, the casing was pulled and the
well shot at a depth of about 2000 feet, at
which depth it will deliver from 20) to 300
barrels of. heavy oil a day. There re
mains a possibility that the lighter oil
exists, but at too great a depth to be
practically accessible. Tbe frequent pres
ence of cas in .the Grace, well would Indi

who, W. J. Wadsworth Jr. said, were op
posed, to him, although he and every
other Republican Assemblyman were in
vited. Wadfiworth sent out many mes
aages to Assemblymen who are support-
Ing him, advising them that no good pur
pose would be served by their attending
the meeting. Although James T. Rogers,
majority leader of the Assembly, and
tno other members of that body called
en him and asked him to be prÂ«sent at
the meeting, he declined to do so.
Thirty-seven Assemblymen were in the
conference, and seme were friends of
WadsworthJ EX A. Merritt Jr.. one of
the leading candidates for the Speaker
ehip, who has the support of Odell, was
present, as were also several former can
didates who dropped out of the contest
when Governor Higgins declared in favor
of Waflsworth.
After having been In session more than
three hours the . conference adjourned
/ trithout having taken any action what
ever. It had been reported that one of
'the purposes of the gathering was to as
certain whether or not the members
" â¢ could egree upon a compromise candidate
for Speaker, but Aesemoiyman Jesee Phll
* lips, who had Issued the call for the con
ference, declared that no compromise can
didate was evea discussed, and that no
teat vote ehowlng the strength of any can
didate was taken.

. for him to withdraw In the- Interest of a
candidate who might be able to unite all
* the Interests opposed to "Wadsworth. he
irould be willing to do so. He replied:
. "1 have not com* to that yet."
The appearance of such a candidate
if ould not surprise some of the mm who
ere well acquainted with the situation.
" 'WadEWorth said to-night:
"I regards the conference as beneficial
' to trie t ee having promoted harmony,
\u25a0which is the purpose of my candidacy.
I wish to. make it absolutely clear that
I am not a - factionUt. It Is not true
that anybody hae asked me to withdraw
from the contest. I am satisfied with
the situation, and .while I do not care
to give any estimates of the number of
Protes In my support, I am assured of a
" Â«af e majority." -. -
Adjournment was taken subject to the
call of Jesse. P. Phillips, who said he
would ierue another call if requested to

Hig-gins left Albany to-night to spend
Chrietma* with his family at Olean. He
did not attempt to conceal the fact that
the outcome of the past week's political
* conflict was satisfactory to him.
"I regard the contest as practically
over,*.' said he, "providing, of course, that
. the Assembly must first act for Itself.
But In view of the positive pledges which
have been given for the support of Wads- !
worth. I regard that matter as settled." \u25a0

FASSETT SCORES ODELL.
Coneressman Says Boss Is Working
From Selflah Motives.
ELMIRA, N. V.. Dec. 22. â Congress
man J- Sloat Fassett. who is home to
epend Christmas with his family, when
shown Chairman Odell's Interview, in
which the latter blamed Fassfett for
the present condition of things in the
Republican party, and the statement of
o Senator , Malby. threatening impeach
ment proceedings against . Governor
Â» Hirsrine. Â«aid:- ;
"The talk of impeachment 0f .% the ,
Governor., is rank nonsense. It. 4ls j
much' better for a Governor in office j
c who Is likely to. be held responsible j
for- party action to <Jo everything., in j
ills power to uplift" the party in the j
inlerÂ«jÂ«ts of the whole people and' the
entire party than for a Governor out
of office for his own selnsh interests
Co maintain, the present? condition of
ti r ngÂ».
\u25a0 Governor Hlggins belongs to;a dif-.
ferent. school from former. Governor
Odell.r ,Governor>,OdGll accuses-Gov
ernor; HiggJhs of duplicity. 'Governor
Jlicplrif* and President Roosevelt" Can
well afford. In view of : their records
and the influence "of* their records upon
the history of the party, to accept the
challenge of a comparison *of records
thus Invited.
'"The er-Governor accuses me of
leading the party to defeat in 1891, but
we were led to defeat in 1890 and also
1592. With reference to the ex-Gov
ernor's assault upon myself, while I
thank him for his tardy acknowledg
ment that I am collarless, I want to
say that this situation is one away
above petty personal likes or dislikes.
The situation cannot be changed by
skill in innuendo or personal epithets.
It is a question of the integrity of the
party life and of the uplifting and
maintaining of the party Ideals along
the old-fashioned lines, where the first
interests were the interests of the
people and party interests were sub
servient to those interests and the
party leaders were subservient to the
whole party." /
After paying Wadsworth a tribute
for his intellectual strength' and de
termination of character Fassett con
cluded as follows:
"The President Is not interested in
this contest for the sake of any one
man. He is anxious for a reorganiza
tion of the party along higher ideals
and for honorable purposes. His Inter
est Is purely unselfish and solely for.
the good of the people and the party.
"I am profoundly grateful to ex-
Governor Odell for attributing to me
the present difficulty which seems to
be surrounding the consummation of
his selfish plans. I think he does me
too much honor. I shall be very glad
if on that point, and that alone, the
Republican party agrees with him. His
reprobation I consider a decoration."
LIVELY BLAZE
ON FERRY-BOAT
Passengers Traveling From
New-York to Hoboken-Are
s Treated to Exciting Eide
NEW YORK. Dec. 22,â While the Dela
ware, Lackawanna and Western ferry
boat Montdair was crowded from end to
end on a trip ' to-night from the foot of
Christopher street to Hoboken fire burst
from beneath the middle of the Inner row
of seats In the men's cabin on the star
board eide. So sudden was the outburst
of name that those sitting on the seats
had narrow escapes from burning. The
shouts of fire sent the passengers In a
rush to the open ends of the boat, men
almost pushing one another into the
water. The panic spread to the women's
cabin, which was also crowded, there be
ing abcut 1000 passengers on the boat.
The Montdair was in midstream.
As quickly as they could make their
way to the fire extinguishers the deck
hands took them down and played "on the
fire, which quickly became only a smudge
of stifling smoke.
.The boat was driven, full speed, with
whistles shrieking, to the Hoboken slip.
The passengers rushed ashore and the
Fire Department put out what remained
of the blaze. It is supposed that a smoul
dering c!gar stub communicated Are to
rubbish and started the blaze.

BERKELEY. Dec 22.â The strain of
protecting an. aged Invalid woman from
the wrath of an insane son, and of exert
iiyr her own will power to subdue the
murderous man, has left Mrs. Martha
Brautlacht In such a condition that to
day, after twenty-four \ hours of extra
ordinary menial excitement, she declared
her fear ; that 1 out of It all might come,
as her own portion, a deranged mind.
; Mrs. Brautlacht, a matron with a fam
ily of HtUe onÂ§s.*. whose husband is a
house painter and -of whom nothing but
the commonplace might be expected,
stood guard for ten hours last night over
Mrs. Mary Averj'. forcing the woman's
son to fcower In" a rear room, where he
could not wreak . Ills murderous spite
against his own mother. With her eye
she -subdued him. He could not choose
but to do her bidding.
William Avery. the son, is a husky.,
powerful- man, and last night he was a
drink-crazed maniac, intent upon mur
der, Jet under the ; influence; of a, quiet
little womanâ his neighborâ he became
subdued, Eat under her spell "throughout
all the long hours after midnight until
<Jawn, and obeyed her every order, with
out a word of resentment.' â¢ / \u25a0"â¢
"The man was subject. to my. will, ap
parently," eald Mre. Brautlacht, at her
home on Northside avenue and Nielsen
etreet, "and while.. I know, he hated me,
etlll he feared me, and I had but to speak
and lay my hand upon his arm, and he
became quiet as a lamb."
Tha experience of thus dealing with a
maniac, holding him in leash with no
pther weapon than a calm eye and a will
uf mysterious force, while revealing Mrs.
Brautlacht as an extraordinary person,,
has brought about the "'condition in which
the fears for her own reason and dreads
to discuss her terrible ordeal.
ASKS IOHGIVEXESS.
She stayed as guard last night over
the invalid, Mrs. Avery. until Dr. Had
.den came this morning with a.n ambu
lance to -remove the aged patient to the
Alta Bates Sanitariumâ stayed long enough
to witness an affecting scene between
mother and son, as the latter, dimly
comprehending the situation, besought
his mother to forgive him, .and then the
intrepid watcher of the night withdrew
to her own home, to the care of. her own
babes. }' .
Her eelf-impesed tack was done. Her
will had conquered the maniac. Hypnotic
magnetic, mesmeric power â its exact
character thÂ«Â» woman says she is at a'
loss to defineâ had operated, she be
lieves, to aid her in her task, and the
task ended, ehe was again a woman
among women, with nerves and brain
that btgged for relief and rest.
"The woman is a wonder," tjuoth Dr.-
Hadden, as he watched her leave her.
post of duty. "She accomplished a mir
acle, If there are such things as mira
cles." :'.':>'
Avery, the erstwhile maniac, remains
at large. His mother's condition Is pre
carious. .The unnatural son ,who sought
her life last night win be kept from her
until she has recovered her strength, or
has been claimed by death. The fright
ful shock of the experience she under
went last night has lessened her chances.
of recovery from the attack o? pneu
monia she has been struggling with, and
her weak heart also is liable to give way
at any moment, say her physicians.
A strange feature of the case Is 4,hat
Mrs. Biautlacht to-day shrinks In terror
from the. thought of again meeting the
man whom she seemed to have hypno
tised. She said: ,
I wish the police would take Avery into cus
tody. " When -the man begged hiÂ» mother to
rorrive him xo-dav. - and ehe waÂ» unable to*
(peak to him, I saw him turn and glare at
me, and I know- that he hates me and would
lnju"re me.
FOHMERLY LIKED WOMAN*.
The man used to like me, I know that. I
had an cxtaordinary influence over blm. He
feared me. too, but it \u25a0Â»â¢*Â« thÂ« fear that a
rattlesnake inspires in a person. He could not
look me in the ej-e. 1 <jo not profess to ek
j.!ain the rtÂ£*on for hiÂ« fear, nor to explain
hotr I was able to control him so easily I
only know thai it w&* done. He knew that 1
coald control him with a look at any time,
and yesterday, when We feared for hip moth
Â«tÂ» safety with him alone In the house with
her. sad when 1 desired to enter, he refused
lo admit roe. I secured entrance by strategy
end while I remained he was <julÂ«t: It wai
after I left at dinner time that he threatened
his mother, and not till I cculd ag-aln get him
under the control of. my will. war he quiet.
I knew if the police took him away iaÂ«
right the excitement of the struggle would kill
his mother, and so I told tnem to let me stay
with him all night, which waÂ» done. One
look \u25a0 from my eye was eaourh for ' him. He
obeyed me Implicitly. But to-day I fear him
He may do me harm. My control pf him seems
to: have weakened. I wish be could be locked
up.
Henry Brautlacht deplores the neces
sity for the ordeal through which she
passed and declares he would not have
permitted it had he guessed; the result
that now appears to threaten his wife.
Avery he denounces as a drunken, crazy
maniac, rendered unnatural by his mental
weakness and excesses.
The police have made no" move to ar
rest Avery. .No complaint has been
sworn to against him, and he roams West
' Berkeley, irresponsible and with none to
check him. ' \u25a0 The Brautlachts purpose
guarding the woman" who foiled him last
night, and .'are prepared" to defend the
house against any assaults the insane
wanderer may conceive.

"Miss O'Neil (the -name Nance she ha 3

wanting- without reducing a whit, the

That' dropping lower jaw is one of the

in spite of her limitations. Really it does
not exist in the dying. It exists in the
already; dead. It is one of the undeniable
stamps '.of - death.. And that is Miss

is seen only. In the dead.: and thus, by a
sort . of. diabolical \u25a0- anticipation, to * reach
the' climax of horror. Her dying is more

SpÂ«clal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Dec. 22.â The , deposi
tions of Frank S. Holland, the deputy
ck-rk who issued the marriage license to
the late ex-State Senator William Johns
ton, the 79-year-old capitalist of Court
land. Sacramento County, and Mrs. Jo
seplilne A. C. Goodwin, who gave her ago
as 59 years, and of Rev. AVUliam H. At
kinson, the pastor of the Congregational
Church, who made the 'aged pair husband
and wife, were taken before a- notary
public to-day. Attorneys representing 1
Mrj. Johnston, who has applied for lqtter*
of administration upon the estate of John
ston, and the sons and daughters of tha
deceased, who are questioning Mrs. John
ston's risht to the letters, were present.
The estate Is valued at $130,000 and consists
chiefly of .valuable fruit-producing lands
on the Sacramento River. ',
The testimony taken is to be used for
the purpose of proving the marriage cer
emony. Several times an effort was made>
to draw out of the deponents their opin
ion as to the mental condition of the aged
groom, but every time the attempt was
made a strong objection was Interposed.
It was brought out, however, that Mrs.
Johnston, in applying for the license and.

Schooners Steering
Gear Is Damaged During
Voyage Down the Coast
The schooner Zampa, which left here
Â«\u25a0 little while ago on a codfishlnjj
cruise, returned to port yesterday with
out a single ash. She reached the
northern fishing grounds safely and the
lish were all there waiting to be
caught, but the waves were too high and
the wind too strong for the fishermen
to ply their occupation. After cruis
ing around for a week or co Captain
Kochier decided that he wanted no fleh
anyway and would sooner spend Christ
mas in San Francisco than catch all
the cod in Alaskan waters.
The Zampa carried men and supplies
to Sar.r.k. These were landed with
come difficulty. This was all that was
accomplished during the cruise and the
men who shipped on the Zampa and
agreed to take their pay out of the
proceeds of the catch know how the
green hands on a whaler feel when
they gÂ«t $1 foT a few hundred dollars'
worth of hard work.
During the cruise John Johannsen, a
native of Sweden. 38 years of age, died
cf dropsy and was buried at sea.
The Zampa came down from Sanak in
twelve and a half days and on the
homeward run ran through much heavy
â¢weather.
The Zampa weathered the gales with
out suffering any damage, but some of
the coasting vessels which reached
port yesterday were not so fortunate.
The steam schconer laqua, which ar
rived yesterday, was six days com
ing from the Columbia River. On De
cember 19, off Cape Blanco, her steer
ing gear was damaged, but temporary
repairs were made at sea and she fin
ished the voyage at reduced speed. The
steamer Tamplco, from Tacoma, also
encountered heavy gales after leaving
the sound.

DEATH BLAMED
UPON ENGINEER
Local Inspectors Find That
: Killing of Water-Tender
Was Due to Carelessness
COMPANY IS CENSURED
Defective Boiler Tubes Or
dered Immediately Taken
Out of the Calif omian
United States : Local Inspectors Bolle*
and Bulger handed. down a decision-yes
terday suspending for three months ; the
licenÃe of Chief -Engineer Hugrh W. Sal
bador of. the steamer Californian. and
censuring the American-Hawaiian Steam
ship Company at' New -York. The f in
spectors find as follows: 'i
On Sunday/September" 17. 1905. thirty-six
hours after the departure of the steamer Cali
fornian from New York on her voyage to Cali
fornia, A. â¢L. Blanchflower. a water-tend sjr.'
while trying to escape from the flreroom of
that vessel â a . deteriorated tube having col
lapsed in the after port- boiler â was overcome
by the steam and vapor, and fell from the main
deck flreroom grating Into the flreroom and was
killed. S. Dsyo, oiler; Georglo Mateljok. Ge
rardo Lopez and Geos BuntJiUck, firemen^ were
scalded, but not fatally. Three of thÂ«*e men
were left in the hospital at St." Lucia, West In
dies. ' \u25a0\u0084...-,.\u25a0-\u25a0.\u25a0\u25a0 - . . .--.v,
After reaching the main deck flreroom plat
form the exits through the alleyway doors from
this platform were closed. The last named
four men managed to escape through the ven
tilators, this being their only means of escape.
The exitH were closed from the platform to the
alleyways. aÂ« coal had been stored in the alley
ways on both sides of the steamer. The upper
deck flreroom grating was eight feet from the
grating en which the men were standing. Had
there been a ladder, from this grating to the
grating above all-of -these'-persons could have
escaped in safety through the doors leading
from, the upper grating out on to the upper
deck - :
: On the arrival' of the steamer Californian in
Philadelphia, Pa., on her last voyage A. Ryan,
chler engineer, notified the superintending en
gineer, Mr. Jlagruder of the American-Ha
waiian Steampshlp Company, the owner of the
veÂ«Â«l, that ilic tuben in the boilers were in
bad condition, and that they should be renewed,
twenty-nine; of them having 1 given out on the
homeward voyage. For some reason or another
Mr. Ryan was discharged and was succceeded
by Hugh W. Salbador. who had previously, held
the position of first assistant engineer on that
steamer for, eighteen months. -After Mr. Sal
bador took charge as chief engineer fifty extra
tubes were placed on board the vessel and she
started on her voyage from Xew York to San
Francisco. .; '- - \u25a0-
Mr. Salbador should have reported the condi
tion of these tubes to the United States in
spectors at New York berore he Wt that port.
as Chief Engineer Ryan had informed him of
their bad condition.' He could not have helped
knowing the fact that these tubes were bad,
he having been eighteen months on thÂ« vessels
as -first assistant prior to his appointment as
chief engineer. Had he attended to hia duties
end examined the boilers internally before ac
cepting the charge, of. them as chief engineer
and then reported the condition of the tubes to
the United States . Inspectors at New York It is
reasonable to suppose that the deteriorated and
defective, tubes would have been removed and
thls^; accident .averted. He cannot be excused
for 'the : indifference manifested as chief engi
neer to the requirements of section 4448, United
States Revised Statutes, In not reporting the
condition of the tubes to the United States in
â¢pectora at \u25a0 New York, i and we therefore, un
der authority of section 4450. United States Re
vised Statutes, suspend his license as chief en
gineer for three months from date hereof.
i We also censure those In charge of the Amer
ican-Hawaiian Steamship Company at New
York for not providing proper means of egress
from the flreroom- on* thUt_j.ve.nsel at: all tim<?!Â«.
and in not*, renewing tli&liail tub.-Â»s In itho.boil
ers bnforV th<?" vessel left' Netv-YorK. as they
should have Uone, knowing- as they did the
condition, of, same. .
On th-j. arrival of the vessel at San Francisco
we ordered all the. tubes in the .boilers to be
taken" out and renewed before we j would allow
the said steamer to leave this port, -which Is
being done at the present time.- ' â¢ -'

RETAIL TRADE
CONTINUES GOOD
Early Predictions 3latle Ee
gai'ding- Holiday Business
Are Being Fully Realized
AGTiYrrr in building
All Sections of the Country
Report That Commercial
Conditions Are Favoitible
NEW .YORK, Dec. 22.â Dun's Weekly
Review" of Trade to-morrow will say:
i.. Although mild weather has greatly fa
cilitated Christmas trade and building:
operations, both of which are surpassing
all previous records, - seasonable staples
would move more freely if the tempera
ture- were lower. -Yet there Is little com
plaint: despite unsettled weather condi
tions... Reports are remarkably uniform
regardinfir commercial conditions, no sec
tion making an unsatisfactory exhibit and
mercantile collections . are Improving.
Railway earnings thus far available for
December surpass the figures of IDQI by
6.3 per cent, and foreign commerce at this
port for the last week showed a gain of
$150,370 in 'exports: and fa' decrease of
?1,574,411 in Imports. -
New business is limited in the iron arid
steel Industry, and contracts cannot be
expected to come .forward freely until
after the holidays.
December building operations will make
an unprecedented exhibit.
There is a free movement of foreign dry
hides at uncha nged 'quotations.
Failures this, week number 226, against
251 last year, in. the United S.tates, and 3S
in Canada, compared with 32 last year.
BradstreeVs to- morrow will say:
Holiday buying gains force and early
predictions of unprecedented business are
being fully, realized. Retail trade In
heavy winter good's still drags, owing to
unseasonable weather. '. Open fall weather
still favors building- activity and another
big year is indicated by high prices and
active demand, for material, particularly
lumber, the outlook being for a heavy
cut this winter. Winter wheat is in good
condition, with fair snow covering. De
mand for money is active, but collections
could be better. Cash is still moving to
the. Interior, but the liquidation of three
Chicago banks has not apparently affect
ed the situation seriously.
- Business failures In the United States
for the week ending December 21 number
235, asainst 226 last week and 249 in the
like week of 1904.
Failures in Canada number 33, against
37 in this week' a year ago.
Wheat, including flour, exports for the
week ending - December 21 are 4.473.452
bushels, against 4,435.162 last week, and
1,080,708 this week last year.
From July 1 to; date exports are 61,732,031
bushels, against 33,782.187 last year.

SATURDAY DECEMBER 23. 1905
CHILD AND STATE.
THE various organizations in this city devoted to organized
charity and reclamation work are represented by a publication
with the title that appears as the heading of this article. Its
legend is : '"It :s wiser end less expensive to save children] than to
punish criminals." The sentiment is a bit confused in statement.
b::t iis intention is righteous altogether. In its last issue this pub
lication makes the statement that: "In San Francisco there are
h;xndreds of boys who have been steaiing since they were five years
old. They have been arrested and found guilty anywhere from one
to twenty times, until now the police either let them alone or drive
them out of sieht and then go to the other end of the beat."
This is the season at which men are drawn to think of their
fellows, of the society of which they are a part, and of the con
stituents which make it up. whose character is to determine what
the future is to be. Juvenile conditions in this city are not excep
tional. They are common to all the large cities of the country.
Benevolent people engaged in reclamation work frequently despair
in the face of difficulties. We have laws forbidding child labor as
cne of the great physical and moral evils. These laws are ener
g-eticallv enforced, until now the philanthropic spirit which prompted
them is diverted to the subject of child idleness. The state takes
charge of the education of the children of the people. Critics of
the public schools charge that they are responsible for the juvenile
incorrigibility which appears in appalling form in so many thou
: sands of children. Others impeach the church, and it and the schools
sre put upon the defensive and plead *'not guilty" to the indictment, j
In cities more densely populated than San Francisco the subject i
ts being expertly studied. In Xew York the Columbia College set-
Â£ tlement t on the East Side, has toiled among the street gangs com
posed of idle and vicious youth, with but little impression. It finds
*an adverse influence that overcomes all that it can do in supplying
â¢\u25a0\u2666hvsicai wants and moral admonition. Clothing and admonishing
the idle is found to be no remedy and to produce results inadequate,
that do not justify the effort made to produce them. That settle
ment reports at last that the sovereign remedy is the absorption
of idle youth into the industries and crafts of the country. Work
is the panacea for the multitude of moral ills that are the pestilence
of cities.
A Xew England teacher, in a. recent lecture, put Judge Lindsay I
of the Denver Juvenile Court among the four really great men of 1
the day in this country^ This is because of his success in handling
juvenile incorrigibles. Upon examination his plan is found to be
the provision of some occupation. His theory apparently is that
â¢ the child who is old enough to steal is old enough to work. When |
one is caught stealing he is given his liberty on parole, and if pos- !
sible some honest occupation is provided for him. or he is kept at \
school, but always under the eye of the court. He enters into an i
agreement with the Judge, and if his part is not kept escape is im- I
possible, and he is ordered into court at once. It is said that this
Denver Judge has succeeded in so rousing the sentiment of honor in
juvenile offenders that even when their delinquency merits con- ]
tinement in the State Reform School he can trust them to carry
their own commitment and go to that institution unattended by an
oScer. One boy of seventeen convicted of grand larceny was sent
by him alone to the reformatory State Prison, an institution inter
mediate between the reform school and the penitentiary.
All these facts are published by the Sari Francisco organiza
tions, with the further statement that in this city juvenile incorri
gibles are permitted two or three probation periods, until they feel
that it is perfectly safe to trifle with and defy the law; and when at
last they are sent to the reform schools their contempt for the law
is unalterable. The State provides the juvenile court and the reform
school, and beyond it the penitentiary and the gallows, and then
folds its hands with a sense of duty entirely done!
The evil grows. The percentage of juvenile crime increases.
The age cf American criminals at the date of first conviction moves
rapidly downward, until it will soon be in the 'teens. Reform
schools increase. The situation is acute. .Either the state, as the
representative of society, or society primarily, must soon move for
ward to a solution of the appalling problem. The impeachment of
the public schools and the church is a vain* thing. Xo education,
no ethics, no system of moral oversight, can overcome the conse
quences of idleness in youth. With no open door to the industries
of the country for its youth, their degeneration cannot be arrested.
The ingenuity and energy of the young, if not properly em
ployed, will be employed improperly. Occupation, honest and suited
to their years, an open path to the trades and handicrafts, the proper
bestowment upon American youth of the opportunity that is now
given entire!}' to adult immigration, should be examined by our
thousands of philanthropists as a solution of the problem which
drives them to despair. We give much attention to the "open door"
for our trade in Eastern Asia. Let us have also an open door to the
occupation of our youth at home.

MEXICO is fairly on the gold standard. The change from
silver was etrectcd without the least financial disturbance
Â«nd has been followed by a rise in the price of silver. This
rise, however, is cot related- to the change of standards at all, but
to the increase in demand for silver in China and Japan, due to the
commercial advance of those countries.
It is said, apparently upon the authority of fairly accurate
statistics, that 75 per cent of the Mexican population is supported,
directly or indirectly, by the ruining industry of that country. Peon
wages have always been low, from 25 to 50 cents per day. But a
rise has begnn and in many parts of the country peons, ndtablv in
Dcrango. now receive Si 25 per day. As their labor is unskilled
rxnd their habits are frugal, this advance means a" great deal to that
class of the popalation-
Peonzge is a form of debt servitude. A man gets in debt to
another and owes service to him. By a subtle system the debt is
made to increase rather than diminish, and the debtors family in
herits it and its accompanying servitude. Heretofore the holding
of peons in this form of servitude has been managed by making/ the
wage low. "If wages go on advancing under. the gold standard, vast
i:cmbers of peons will buy their freedom by paying the inherited
debts which caused them to be born in bondage. The economic
erect cpon Mexico would be incalculably beneficial. A free popu
lation, ambitious to get the benefit of its own labor and enterprise,
is the making of any country. With freedom will come more gen
eral education and a great upraise in Mexican life, will result.
By way of contrast, Mexico and Sweden and Norway offer an
interesting study. Mexico, with peonage and restricted "education.
hzs a wonderful and rich variety of natural resources. Sweden and
Norway, with a cold and -rather sterile country, have individual
freedom, and are the only countries in the world in which every
grown man can read and write. Therefore the. Scandinavians have
prosperity, good homes 2nd a general and splendid civilization, while
Mexico, with friendly climate and great natural resources. lags
behind. But the signs of advancement are many and encouraging,
snd there is every reason for taking a cheerful view of the future

DON'T get too comfortable- Don't

I would say this to every woman "who

In this age of material prosperity, of

I is fcr women this danger of falling into

It is not ease that make's for the;

J lion. We mortals, are deluded into be

Ing for ultimate ease and cessation

The woman 'who must , struggle . to
earn her living, and the woman. who
must work hard in the perf orroance of
domestic duties, both envy ' the -woman
of leisure and believe the very acme
of happiness consists in being able to
"take things *-asy."
Under certain conditions this might
be so. Certainly . It would seem that
leisure would give one an opportunity
to cultivate the higher attributes. But
apparently the race has not yet evolved
] far enough to put leisure to such use.
Unfortunately we find that facts do
I not bear out our theory of ease as an

With every material desire satisfied

ished, these do not and life so greatly

Xovel Christmas Festival
PRAISE FROM LAXGDOX
Large Audience Fills Stein
way Hall to Enjoy Songs.
Drills and the Recitations
The Christmas festival given at Stein
way Hall last nigbt by the pupils of the
Chinese public school was one of the
cleverest juvenile performances ever held
under the auspices of the School Depart
ment. The little Celestials proved sweet
singrers as well as apt and willing per
formers, and held the crowded hall in
wrapt attention for two hours and a half
while the festival was in progress.
y The programme consisted of recitations,
* *cngs, choruses and drills. It was given
unfier the direction of Mrs. C. C. New
hall, principal of the school. Miss Estclle
Carpentei, director of music In the school
department, had charge of the musical
programme, while George S. Miehllng, in
structor of wrestling at the Olympic Club,
directed the drills of the boys.
Superintendent of Schools Langdon was
one of the invited guests and he opened
the festival with a few brief remarks.
Mr. Langdon paid a high tribute to the
Chinese children for the progress they
had made In their stuflleÂ« and thanked
their teachers fcr the zeal and earnest
ness they displayed in bringing the sys
tem of the Chinese school up to its pres
ort high standing.
T"he opening number was a salute to the
Sag, which was borne by a cute little
Mongol. Nearly 100 pupils of the school
took part in this drill and it proved a
rery pretty sight. The choruses, "Amer
ica." "My Own United States," abd "Blue
Bells of Scotland" were -very well ren
, dered by the pupils, â¢'many of whom pos
sessed sweet voices.
\u2666 One of the most artistic features of the
â¢ntire programme was the fan drill by
twenty girls, ranging In size from tiny
tots io young women. This drill was in
charge of Miss E. McCall, and the glrla
through the various maneuvers and
i;ertures with a true display of Oriental
fTace and delicacy. The hoop drill was
another pretty number, as were the mo
tion sonus.
"The military drill and the dumbbell ex
â¢ â¢ctees by the boys of the school were
rendered under the direction of
T-iehllng. A novel feature of the even
ing*s entertainment was the Chinese mu
sical instrument selections played by
t>uong Wing. Quong Ting and Paul Lee.
This proved an attraction entirely new to
fhe Caucasian members of the audience,
find with them it made a great hit. Mem
bers of the Columbia Boys' Park Club
contributed musical selections and a com
tcaj skit to the programme.
The following teachers of the Chinese
srtiool were associated in the management
or the affair with Mrs. Newhall: Miss
J. E. Groer, Miss V. Relchling, Miss C.
branch. Miss V. Nixon, Miss A. E. Grif
fith. Miss J. A. Cliker. Miss E. McEner

Tnistees of Monument to
California Volunteers Ask
That a Site Be Designated
At the meeting of the Board of Park
Commissioners/ : room 1000, . Palace
Hotel, yesterday afternoon,, a letter
from James D. Phelan. W. J. Martin
ana 11. H. de Young, relative to the se
lection of a site for the monument to
commemorate the service* of the Cali
fornia Volunteers In the Philippines was
discussed. The memorial is an eques
trian group by the well-known sculptor,
Douglas Tilden. The trustees, who
have authorized an expenditure of $25,
000 for the monument, favor a site at the
intersection of Market street and Van
Ness avenue. The president of the
board, A. B. Spreckels, and Commis
sioners R. H. Lloyd, W. J. Dingee. "W. H.
Metson and Earl Cummings exchanged
views on the subject. It was noted that
the panhandle if extended would touch
Market street at Van Ness avenue. The
board decided, to refer the letter to Earl
Cummings, artist member of the board,
for report at the next meeting. It is
expected that his report will contain
data respecting the area of ground
which the base of the group will oc
cupy, and also the height of the monu
ment.
In a communication R. P. Schwerin
advised the board that six cases of Jap
anese wood carvings were at the Luxor
ready for unpacking and transfer to the
Park Museum.
tVAXT APPROPRI ATIO2V.
Albert Snyder, chairman of the gar
den committee of the California Col
lege of Pharmacy, informed the board
that the college authorities intended to
ask the Legislature for an appropriation
for a botanical garden. The suggestion
was made that the fund might be ad
ministered by the Park Board. The
Commissioners were not enthusiastic
over the proposition. The subject was
referred to Commissioner Metson.
C. VT. Conlisk, secretary of the Hotal
ing Estate Company, Informed the
board in a written communication that
efforts were under way to remove the
signs facing the ocean boulevard. In
quiries developed a statement that' a
contract existing between an outdoor
advertising concern and the Hotallng es
tate would expire within two months.
After considerable discussion the Com
missioners directed Superintendent Mc-
Laren to lay out sidewalks and protec
tive lattice on the park line of the Great
Highway from the park line to the foot
of-the Cliff House hill. The unsightly
Blgns, If not removed, may be obscured.
Report was made to the Commission
ers that fishermen in a boat were again
firing on the seals that inhabit Seal
Rocks. Thursday morning eight seals,
were killed and many wounded. The
firing was renewed yesterday morning
and several seals were slain: A motion
that a reward of $200 be offered for the
arrest of seal killers was carried by unan
imous consent.
PICTURE AS GIFT.
Commissioner Lloyd announced that
a picture of Lake Nicaragua, painted by
Norton Bush, was one of the latest gifts
to the Park Museum. Norton Bush, de
ceased, was one of the best known ar
tists in California. He went to Central
America on -a mission for W. C. Ralston
and during the journey loitered at the
lake and painted the picture, which re
cently came into the possession of Da
vid Bush. The latter was about to pre
sent it to one of the leading clubs of
the city when Commissioner Lloyd di
rected his attention, to the distinction
which the paintinp would confer on the
museum, so that which was slated for
the club went to the park. The Com
missioners would be pleased if other
meritorlbus examples of the work of
California artists were tendered to the
museum. The board gave a vote- of
thanks to David Bush.
Mention was made of the will of E.
Walter, in which the gift of a valuable
collection of pictures is made to the
Art Museum. The sum of $50,000 is
also given for the 'construction of a
room wherein the Walter collection may
be placed. Furthermore, an additional
sum of $-0,000 is set aside for invest
ment, the income to go to a son of the
testator, provided the son will take
charge of the collection. The Commis
sioners are sure that the late Mr. Wal
ter had the Park Museum in mind when
he made his will in favor of tha Art
Museum of San Francisco.
The largest tusk in the world, the
tusk of some tremendous , mastodon of
Alaska, Is now, the property of the mu
seum. Lipman Sachs gave the specimen
to the park.

THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, SATURDAY, / DECEM BER 23, 1905.
YULETIDE SPIRIT
TURNS TO IRE.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
"Der Gris'mas nierryful and der hab
biness noo year ter you mine vlshiss,"..
was the greeting cordially, shouted by
Otto Martiens, marine ' fireman, Just re
turned from a' voyage, as" he extended
a grimy hand across the saloon bar
presided over by L. J. Becker at 25
East street. . 1- / .
There was decided coldness in Mr.
Becker's response.' Ignoring the prof
fered fist and vigorously polishing a
beer glass that was not In urgent need
of Buch treatment, ; he sullenly \u25a0; mut
tered, "Goot eef'nin'."
"Der frozen face I gedsâ you hend Id
ovid, vy?"Mr. Mertlens demanded, his
tone denoting piaue. â
"Der chilly mldd I gifs," replied Mr.
Becker, still rubbing the glistening
"schooner," "begraus der gled mldd you
desserfs nein." v r
"Der oxblanationin* of der meanln' I
vaits," said Mr. .Martiens, withdrawing
his rejected digits and spectacularly
clenching them..
Mr. Becker unhesitatingly explained
the frigidity of his manner. While ful
ly cognizant of the peace and good will
significance of the Christmas season,
he could not sincerely clasp hands with
a brother Teuton who had deliberately
permitted his bibulous patronage to bo
alienated by a person named McCarthy.
The fact that said McCarthy's barkeep
er was of - the gentler sex and comely
of face and form and engaging as a
conversationalist did' not ameliorate
Mr. Martiens'- treacheryâ aye, treason
â in the slightest, but rather: served to
make his .abandonment of the Becker
groggery all the more reprehensible.
"Soâ oh," ' Mr. Becker perorated, "der
merryful Gris'mas- from you I vands
nein. Der greetin' you'd bedder safe
feah der fraulein der choint In der
gorner ar-r-ount."
In vain Mr. Martiens endeavored to
defend his confessed bewitchery by
the siren of the McCarthy bar. When
love steps in, he argued, racial; loyalty
is retired, even as family ties are sev
ered by the grand passion. At the
safne time he objected to having V the
shrine of his 'goddess alluded to as a
"choint" by Mr. Becker, inasmuch as
the term, especially when applied ,In
severity, implied /that Its author held
the young woman's character in light
esteem. - . . - :
"Der choint id Iss," was the reiter
ative retort that provoked Mr. Mar
tiens to pick up from the coiinter^i
heavy slab of stone used as a match
box ancS hurl it with fortunate inac
curacy of aim at Mr. Becker's head:
The missile shattered"" J3 worth' of
glassware and Mr, Martiens was -ar
rested and booked for peace disturb
ance and malicious mlscnief.
"Der demeges I seddle feah alretty
yed," he said to" Police Judge Fritz,
"und der fine I.vill bay. yes?" { f
"Ten dollars," said the Judge, and
the sum was promptly deposited in
Clerk Duffle's hand. -
Mary Plaza, a moon-faced Mexican lass
behaved quite hysterically after . Judge
Mogan had sentenced her to ten days' im
prisonment for vagrancy and committed
her /or trial by jury, on the charge of
having held up and robbed of $42 a Stan
islaus Countj' farmer who was slumming
on the Barbary Coast.. - : v\u25a0. â¢ .
As she sat in court' aldngside! another
miserable specimen of femininity -Miss
Plaza laughed and. wept . alternately, and
occasionally buried' her : visage within the
folds of a cavalryman's yellow-lined cape
which she wore 'as a wrap. Her unseemly
conduct conveyed, palpable embarrassment
to her sister in mi jfortune,* who smoothed
her own bedraggled; skirt and unkempt
hair, and otherwise endeavored to con
vince a grinning audience that she pos
sessed more self-respect than Miss Plaza's
behavior reflected. .
Mrs. Nellie Henry of .137 Wood ~ street
denied that'she boxed the ears : of little
Johnny Murphy of 14 St.' Rose avenue in
retaliation for his slapping other juvenile
son's face, but Mrs. Mary O. * Stanley,
who dwells^next door to "Mrft/'Henry,
averred that through her â¢/ window " she
plainly witnessed the assault ' alleged by
Master Murphy's mother in*' her V formal
complaint of battery against Mrs.* Henry,
and that she "(Mrs. Stanley):; told ; . Mrs.
Henry that she ought to be ashamed of
herself for having, beaten a little boy who
was no older in years or more formidable
in physique than the little boy 'he had
beaten. â¢ ;
Despite the clinching testimony adduced
by Mrs. Stanley, 'Judge -Cabaniss,' whose
fame as a diplomatic arbiter of neighbor
hood broils is becoming enviable, declined
tc consign Mrs. Henry to spend a Christ
mas in jail,. but his dismissal of the lady
was not unaccompanied by a reprimand.
Frederick Olochefeckl, bricklayer, re
siding at 127 Eighth street/whose stolid
Rhenish temperament was unmoved, by
appeals that he contribute to the main
tenance of his, wife and. two chlldren,lwas
sentenced -to .three months' imprisonment
by Judge Fritz,,' and' he accepted .the' sen
tence with the I same i Imperturbability of
countenance that marked - his l rejection of
the ; iroplorations : that . he : do : his f duty..; as
a husband : and , father. \ He , earned $6 ' a
day and refused to/ give ; reason - for his
Inhuman' treatment of his family.
Loudly uttering dismal cries and waving
around his head a 1a 1 coat sleeve vacant':be

PRIEST BACK
FROM MEXICO
Father H.H. .Wyman Gives
Account of. Observations
Taken During; a Vacation
COUNTRY PROGRESSIVE
Attributes Advance to;' the
People Themselves
Than to Outside Influence
The Rev. Father H. H. .Wyman, pas
tor of St. Mary's (Paullst) : Church, has
just returned: from the City of Mexico,
where he passed a three ' weeks' vaca
tion: PsP s
Speaking of his visit there, Father
Wy man "said:
TVe hayÂ« all heard of late of the great prog
ress of the MexlcafT republic .durtng recent
years and the so-called Americanization of Its
i people. .: -/\u25a0.\u25a0\u25a0
It- Is. . of course." flattering to ourselves to
think .that another people so near, our borders,
yet so ' far â¢ removed iby race traditions if om
ourselves. , has been . bo \u25a0 Influenced by our na
tional Ideas and methods as to have of Itself
adopted and .assimilated; them and thereby ad
vanced In the course of civilization. : -:.sZ f^.
However, when we . carefully examine the
causes which have produced Mexico's present
prosperity, we find that the . der\rÂ«lopment Is
due rather to ita Inhabitants' own peculiar
characteristics than . to . special outside, Influ
ences. ; â¢ .'. - 1 '.--' \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0-..' ."'\u25a0.\u25a0-'- ' .'. . V
If an Intensely patriotic mationar spirit and
a desire to achieve a greatness which Is all
their . own, ' and to â¢. win thÂ» . respect of other
nations on account of It be â¢ thus . Interpreted
by us. it will surely not * offend, them if we
imagine it to.be Americanization, provided
thsK, ; are allowed to have It i and glory, in ! It
as a M-exicantzation. â¢
â¢It is true that a largÂ»' number of Americans
have . made their homes- in its principal cities
and are engaged In flourishing business enter
prises, and, as far as I could learn, they are
enthusiastic In thÂ«lr admiration of Its govern
ment and are particularly grateful for the Just
consideration which they receive from its offi
cials \u25a0 and people. 4,^Sa*^**^Ew*fc^y^a*WÃÃWÃ)'
Other foreigners have the same feelings, "but
do : not. Imagine Â° that they are - denationalizing
the country. . '
The smoothness . with which the machinery
of government moves is, ; I think, to bo at
tributed chiefly to the absence of political
party strife and the realization iof the people
that Inasmuch as thÂ« ends of government art
now being practically secured, disturbance had
better not ,bÂ« attempted by reform or revolu
tionary, movements. .
Saaret Concert.
EmileSauret, the great French violin
ist, and Arthur Speed, the-, eminent
young English pianist, -will give their
farewell concert : in ; this. ; city, at' L.yrio
Hall this afternoon; 1 at. 2:30 o'clock.'
These artists have created'" a* genuine
musical sensation in v San . Francisco

greeted with a crowded house. 'Their

' The spell of the Christmas holidays
it upon the duck shooters and the
feathered denizens of the marshes will
have a slight respite to-morrow and
"Monday. Conditions will , be different
on New Tear's day, when every man
interested In duck shooting will make
an effort to be on the marsh to Indulge
in his favorite sport.
The recent rains were not heavy
enough to change the prevailing con-,

they would never be able to attract tho
ducks to their ponds... They;went ahead
and put in !&\u25a0 lot : of improvements, in
cluding ponds -of great area. -
Their shooting has been- , improving
steadily, until at. the* present time the

IS OUT OF PRACTICE
California Club Officials
Offer an Artistic Cup
for the Competition
- . \u25a0 ~ â \u25a0
The chief topic of conversation among
tenni* enthusiasts is the round robin. In
vitation scratch singles tournament
which will commence on the California
Club courts one week from to-morrow. The
coming event is attracting: - L unusual at
tention and will prove the most Inter
esting held on the courts in years. Never
before have there been so many ciack
players so evenly" matched. In the past,
one or two players have, as a rule, out
classed the remainder, but this year there
are about ten between whom there is lit
tle to choose.
Much to the surprise of followers of
the game Coast Champion Janes has an
nounced his intention of not participating.
When a round robin was suggested be
tween the four champions for the year,
namely. Coast Champion Janes, State
Champion . Adam?. Bay Counties Cham
pion Foley and San Francisco County
Champion Gardner, Janes was the only
one of- the four who declined the Issue.
His action at that time was commented
upon as the opportunity of settling the
question of supremacy for the year, and
was missed through the champion's re
fusal to play. Janes thought he would
lose his championship title, despite the !
fact that he was assured that under no j
circumstances could the honor bÂ« taken
from him.
When the coming tournament was ar
ranged It was thought ' Janes would be
glad, to compete, but to the surprise of
all he comes out openly and declares he
will not play. No title goes with the
tournament and it is not even confined to
champions. Despite this fact Janes con
tends he cannot afford to lose it. He
says he is not at his best at present,
owing to lack of practice. This may be
true, but the fact" remains he has been
bratea three times since he won the
championship : and by three different
players. He has a chance now to wipe
out these defeats and retrieve hts lost
laurels.
By those who know it is figured Janes
has fully as good a chance to win as any
of the other ten players. It la evident
Janes does not so figure. He undoubtedly
lost much of his nerve when Melville
Long took him into camp two weeks
ago, and aa nerve is a big part of the
game the champion rightly figures he Is
not at his best.
â¢ Janes* absence from the tournament
will detract little interest from it. Few
look upon him as "the best player in the
city, ' and the winner of the event will
be so considered, t with \u25a0or -without .the
champion. . Janes will lose more by re
fusing to play than he would by play
ing' and losing.
The directors of the California Club, at
their monthly meeting las,t Tuesday night
decided to offer a handsome silver cup
for the event. There will probably be
a suitable second prize also. The club
will furnish the balls. Play will com
mence Sunday, the 31st inst., and will be
resumed January 1, 7 and 15. Each player
will be called upon to play at least two
matches on each of these dates. All
matches will consist ' of two sets out of
three.
The only event scheduled \u25a0-\u25a0 for Christ
mas day is a handicap doubles tourna
ment at the California Club. The draw
ings will be held this afternoon and .the
opening rounds will be played ' to-mor
row. The semi-finals and finals will be
played on Monday. The competition will
be- for the three-time cups, which are in
the possession of Melville Long and Carl
Gardner. The latter will play with his
brother Herbert to-morrow. Janes and
H. Long having decided to split up. The
Longs, with Schmidt and Rolfe. will
probably be the most heavily handicapped
team?.
Early next month the ladies of the Cal
ifornia Club will start a continuous tour
nament. It is several years since a
woman's tournament has been held on
the c&ib courts. Interest has revived of
late, and as there are many new players,
some interesting competitions will be held
In -the next few months. The continuous
tournament will probably run for three
months. It will be In charge of MJss
Valleau.-Miss Ethel Smith and Miss da
Nerveaux, the tournament committee.
The Golden Gate Club will hold its first
tournament of the new year on January
7. It will be a class of single events. The
first and third class players will meet on
this date and the second and fourth
cracks . ; will. come. together a week later.
The next tournamentv of the Golden
Gate Junior Tennis Club will ba held

to-morrow, the ball being kicked off
at 2:30 p. m. The proceeds of thÂ«
game will be handed over to Alexander

On Wednesday evening, the 27th inst.,

knows. Henry Roberts, secretary of
the C. A. F. Union, will go to thÂ« cap
ital to referee the game.
The Albion Rovers won a lucky vic
tory over the Independents last Sun
day, the score being equal until almost
the end of the second period, when Pe
trie, the strong. forward of the Rovers,
put the ball into the net and won the
match for his team. The Independents
now stand forth in the table of league
results with two points less than the
Rovers and three less than the Vam
pires and Hornets. Aa the Independent
team is composed of almost exactly the
same men as won the championship and
the cup. last season, and has actually
scored more goals this season than any
other eleven, it is clear that the other
clubs must have stronger teams than
they had last year. W. E. Owens has
taken charge of the Independent team
again and will endeavor to stem thÂ«
tide of defeat. R. Shand having re
signed his place as goalkeeper for tho
Albion Rovers in order to leave him
self freer for his newspaper work, Todd
now guards the net. The new goal
keeper did excellent work last Sun
day, clearing many dangerous shots e*S
the Independent forwards. The Rover^
being without the services of Slichle..'
Tterney and Mulligan. Lydon went into
the halfback line.
The Oakland Hornets, though they
have played only five games, while ail
the teams except the San Francisco and
Santa Cruz have played six or seven
league matches, stand at tha head of
the table of league results with ten
points, not having lost a game and
fewer goals having been scored against
them than against any other team. TnÂ«
Vampires also have seven points to
their credit, but they have played seven
matches. In two of which they -were
beaten. The San Francisco team is
working Its way up, having: tied tho
Independents and beaten the Vampires
on two successive Sundays. On Sun
day, the 31st Inst., they play at Santn

torney Dibble, who represents the de
fendant, suggested that the trial be
postponed, owing to tbe near approach
of the holidays. He knew that.Assist
ant District Attorney Ferral was
agreeaÃle to a postponement:
Tbe Judge remarked that Dibble had
changed his mind, as at the previous
calling of the case he had expressed
his anxiety for a. speedy., trial. He
hinted that the change might have been
influenced by the fact that there was
soon to- be a change In the administra
tion and the new District Attorney
was not familiar with the facts, all of
which Dibble denied. \u25a0;.'
The Judge insisted upon the Jury be
ing Impaneled and, the work was be
gun. During the' morning session
twenty-four were examined and not
one was accepted. Three were per
emptorily challenged and the . others
wore excused because they did not be
lieve in capital punishment for women
or in; circumstantial evidence. At the
afternoon cession* out of tweny-eight
examined, four were accepted. They
were William Hearne, F. P. Cole F V
Kelson and A. B. Patrick. The case
was continued till Tuesday morning.

CLEVER DEFENSE OF GAME
BT FACULTY COMMITTEE
Assert the Intercollegiate Contests Claim
but JFew Victims-
Injured Are Usually fon Prepajfator^
School or Scrub Elevens. \,, M
BERKELEY, Dec. 22.â The Academic
Council of the University of California,
which recently requested the athletic
committee of the faculty to prepare a
report upon the football situation at
the university and to recommend
changes in the game, received from the.
committee la6t night an exhaustive re
port, cleverly .written, which Included
a complete account of the recent meet
ing between the athletic. committees of
both Stanford and California universi
ties, with independent remarks upon
the football situation.
The Academic Council formally ap
proved the report, which follows:
â¢Ttr the Academic Council 01 the UniverÂ»ity
of California â Gentlemen: At the meeting of
the council held November :Â», lyO3. the com
mittee on athletics was asked to make a re
port at an early date on the subject or tootball.
lour committee begs leave to present the lol
lowin;:
Football Is now being buffeted by a storm of
criticism which has been gathering tor some
years past. Much of It Is 111-advlsed and ig
uorant, but much is particularly pointed, as it
comes from athletes who have been lootball
. enthusiasts.
American college football Is a manifestation
lot the spirit ; thÂ« lame spirit that Is la our
commercial life and enterprise*; the name spirit
that prompts the undertaking of and stimu
lates' rhe doing of " things. It makes for the
development ot the power of concentration, for
co-operation, for team work, j for courage, for
confidence, for clean living,' for strength of
purpose and for strength ot body.
American college tootball provides a specta
cle; it is not a came. It Is not what we or
dinarily term recreation or pastime. It is. not.
physical culture. That there Is a demand lor
wme such spectacle is evidenced by the crowds
that attend the so-called "big games." In
California the numbers are from 13, G00 to 16,
ow. The last Harvard- Yale contest was wit
nessed by 48,000. Those desiring to attend far
exceed those numbers.
That - college tootball as it exists Is not a
game is illustrated by th-e fact that In the first
twelve years in which- it has held eway on the
Paclnc Coast only seventy-live students of the j
University of California have taken part, or ,
have been rubstltuteo, In the "big games" with.
Stanford. It exists as an- activity for the few,
not the many. It exists solely as an intercol
legiate spectacle. The "big game" and victory
are Us exclusive reasons for belnp. Remove it
from the category of intercollegiate contests
and it- would die.
The interest of the public in the contest has
made the opportunity for enormous gate re
ceipts, which in turn have afforded facilities
for further specialization of the contest. So
far has this process of specialization now gone
that . Triai. y old enthusiasts have withdrawn
their support, and many of the players them
selves are with difficulty urged upon the field
and held there. College football as at present
played is too severe for untrained men and too
highly developed to be interesting or possible
to the many, i It exists as a partisan activity,
and at . present derives its main interest for
spectators from that fact.
FOOTBALL MEX GOOD STUDENTS.
It is, however, true" that the gate receipts
ait the football contests are used' to promote
other forms of student activity. All receipts
at this university so into the general student
treasury, to.be expended by the executive com
mittee of the associated students. '" The receipts
from other sources than football- are relatively
small. The general treasury assists I rowing.
track.. Last Kill, tennis, .music, debating and
chess During the past year the general treas
ury has supplied . f&5O lor boating interests.
During the past live years it has supplied
$5770 to the musical organizations of the uni
versity. -' v 'â¢*.;
The scholarship record of football men who
have taken . part in contests with Stanford,
from the beginning of such contests .to the
pree-ent time, shows that the football men have
graduated the same per cent of their number
as have the other 4000 men of the university.
Ex-participants, without exception so far as
we know, want the contests to continue, but
many of them wish some modification of the
rules. . \u25a0 â¢ . \u25a0
It does not seem possible to devise a game in
which the strong and the weak, the big and
the little.' the trained and the untrained, can
all take part, manifesting the same courage,
the same ability to overcome opposition, the
sarr.Â« endurance, and with the same. promise of
success. â¢
Such a spectacle as college football makes
for the development of college spirit and en
thusiasm. It serves as a rallying center for
divers* interests. | It makes for a certain
solidarity in the student body and has, more
than any other agency, kept alumni . in close
touch with the institution. It gives an op
portunity for & fine discipline affecting both
player and spectator. The committee believes
in football. It believes that a hard game in
volving physical contact and engaging for the
time all the energies of the* players belongs
in an Anrlo-Saxon community. - .
Baseball develops the skill, ; the judgment,
the quickness and some team work. But it
lacks the element of personal contact. Be
sides it is much better done by professionals.
And what professionals can -do better than
college men will not be a college eport' of
much standing. Professionals do not row- in
eights and do not play football. These can
then be college sDorts. - \u25a0.
The most conspicuous charge . at present is
that football Is Intolerably rough. Newspa
pert have printed statistics to Â«>how that nlne
te-; n (IS) r-ersons have been killed and more
than one hundred and thirty (130) -have been
seriously Injured during the past year as a
result of playing football. This, record is
alone sufficient â bald. Inadequate and unana
lyzed as it stands â to unite the sedentary, the
unathlelic and the timorous with - the . many
whese knowledge of the contest has been sole
ly through hearsay into a body of fierce op
ponents of such a eport.'
FEW HURT IV COLLEGE CAMB.
When tbÂ« record is analyzed, it is found
that one of the' victims was a girl,- and almost
every one of the others 'a member of a-prep
aratory school or a scrub eleven: Strictly
college football has . claimed a very small
number of victims the country over. When
the record of the last ten years of football
on the Pacific Coast is examined, it is at once
apparent that the serious Injuries received by
players have been very few. Recent games
have been almost : without -' accident. . though
]>!a>-<Â»d with great spirit' and determination.
There Is no doubt that football is rough. -The
facts seem- to indicate further that â¢It Is . In
tolerably rough for untrained men and , un
seasoned preparatory school ! boys and' girls.
They do not, however, warrant itÂ« withdrawal,
on the same ground, from Its place as a college
contest. ....,\u25a0 . Â« :
j Proposals have 'been made to mitigate the.
i roughness, which must bo a necessary part ot
! the contest, by so modifying the rules as to
I compel a more open .' style of attack and - de
fense. Whatever the advantages, especially to
! the Â«pectator, of open play, the testimony not
I only of the recent history of football but of
I football . men themselves - demonstrates - that a
large proportion of .the injuries result from open
! play. A tackle In an open field most football
I men "desire to' avoid. Danger lurks' wherever
the bail 'ls " carried. â¢ Until that feature of Ihe
game.be eliminated (*nd with such elimination
American college football' would cease to exist)
the contests will not cease to require men who
are '.veil trained, skillful, courageous and indif
ferent to hard knocks.
In ons particular, however, ; the i eeverity of
the '\u25a0\u25a0 close formation - may- be lessened. It; is
; possible under the existing rules to form heavl-.
! ly behind ' the line \u25a0 for â¢ a momentum play di-.
: reeled hard at a smaller, number of men in the
opposing team. This play, nas In it: the germ
of unfairness because one man is literally, pit
ted against several â¢ who ; have - the further .ad
vantage of knowing where the attack is to. be.
made. If tins same man be attacked repeatedly
it is only a queetion of time until ; the defend-
Ing player -is ; rendered physically incapable
through exhaustion. -. ' , - ' ' \u25a0
So far. the physical , aspect ' of roughness lin
contest has been discussed.. \u25a0"-The moral aspect,
involving the spirit of true sportsmanship, Is oj
far greater importance.: ' Slugging,; ; kneeing,
neck-twitting, putting a ; good -man out of the
contest by- vicious attacks even ; when ; such at
tacks contribute nothing, to:the success of the
play then in progress,- are practices which can."
not be too severely : condemned " and : punished.
Kule*' which are properly framed should be en
forced with the utmoÂ«t \u25a0 vigilance,' accuracy, and
dispatch; and additional: penalties beyond what
are now provided 'should, be Imposed.' Such pen-*
allies may be not, only removal from; the con-:
test; but disqualification for the peaaon, or per.
trwnently. - V>*2SBHB39iHBGfIHfifiOBKBHBOM

RULES COMMITTEE ATTACKED.:; !
The present agitation, against- football we'
believe to ba due to the following:, .'â¢ : \u25a0'.<":
Mrst â The jact that ,; unoer present ;condi
tions there is government ; without representa-.
tlon. That is repugnant to the American mind.
A practically selr-constltuted t and '.aeu-perpet- '
uaung committee ot seven ,(Â«) assumes to con
trol these contests all over the country. * Some
of the members of.' this â¢ committee are^dls-'
tlnctly - professionals. . v Â«.v : ".. '.\u25a0' .
Secondâ There is the feeling that the large:
gate receipts' offer an | opportunity for the un
tair manager to use unialr means â¢ in . getting \u25a0
-coaches and men, who will themselves be unfair
in order to.'bring.'the", victory that, they .have"

testant in years. - Some : people are altogether
too ready to charge that what might have
been done was done/ _â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0--- '. -..:â¢:-.
Fourth â The contests are said to be brutal, j
They are rough, and sometime.* accidents oc
cur, but. we submit that we have not in. years
seen any brutality on a football field. Brutal
ity lies in the intent to do harm. -Such intent
does not' exist "in California contests.
Fifth â There is personal danger to those par
ticipating in the contests. - But, no danger, no
courage. It Is said, and â¢ we ; believe . it, that
no one has ever been killed or been seriously,
injured in any of the '.'big games" of the
i country. The dangers of football are not so
great' as the dangers of . mountain climbing.
For example, in Switzerland I the deaths from
mountain climbing are ;from 300 to 400 per
year. Nor are .the dangers of .football so
great as the dangers I of yachting,-, of swim
ming, of automobiling, - or of - roller skating.
The greatest likelihood of physical harm comes
to boys of. high school age. -They have grown
beyond their strength. They are apt to be
less carefully trained. If trained at all, and
they are inclined to be reckless. .. ,
Sixth â The preparation for the contests ab
sorbs too much, of the time and the energy of
the participants and of the- interested * non
participants during \u25a0 the . eight or ten-weeks
which- precede the ','blgr game." - Tlie commit
tee feels. that too much time if devoted to tlic
preparation of a team. But there is something
of value In It aa a lesson in special preparation
looking toward the attainment :< of a: definite
result. We believe: that football' tends'to di
minish loafing and ; loaferlshness.V- Its Influence
is decidedly against any and aU forms of dis
sipation and what is sometimes called "rough
housing-." .
NO SUBSTITUTE FOR BIG GAME.
, Your committee believes, in- football. : There
are always two sides to a question, ; else there
would _be no question. Some such; spectacular
contest seems useful In "such a' community as
ours. No satisfactory substitute has been pro
posed.' We believe â¢ that J modifications : can be
made that. shall diminish the. evils without de
stroying the virility of a: contest, la; favor ot'
which very'much can be'sald. /We 'are of the
opinion that rules governing, the spectacle may
be co framed as to do. away with the prepon
derance of masx play; 'to diminish the ten-,
dency to fake. lnjury when rest and comfort Is ;
what is wanted;- to 'diminish the 'opportunity'
for unfairness; to present a spectacle that shall"
not be tiresome; and to. have, simpler and-bet
ter codified rule*. We believe in a representa
tive -government, and In having alert and un

ly appealed: to the. late Government in his

'While the .Premier had little to say on
the Irish question, the Conservatives will
take j his announcement that "those do

nounced to-day : that Charles M.
Schwab has disposed of the large Pa
cific Coast smelting plant, which he

PAYS TRIBUTE OP RESPECT
TO LATE CAPTAIN SPILLANE
Judge Graham Adjourns Court Oni of
llrgard to the .Memory of the .
Deceased.
Superior Judge Graham paid a trib
ute yesterday to the memory- of the
late Captain of Police John Spillane.
The court ordered that court adjourn
out of respect to the memory of the
veteran official, and in so ordering.
Bald:
In adjourning to-day, Mr. Clerk, let It ap
pear on the minutes of this department that
the court adjourns out of respect to the mem
ory of ' my - departed friend, Captain John
gplllane." . , \u0084 -..+-â... .+-â..
Captain Spillane' 9 death is. a great loss to
the - citizen)! of this community. In the dis
charge of his duties as acting Chief and Cap
tain, of Police he exhibited rare qualities; and
that , he performed the duties devolved upon
him to the satisfaction and benefit of tho
community and endeared himself to the hearts
of the public Is attested by the sadness and
the sorrow which prevails, not only among his
brother officers and Intimate friends.' but
throughout the city at large. *
As an officer he was fearless and courageous;
firm as adamant in his* efforts to bring the
guilty to punishment, but to the unfortunate
aa gentle as a mother. His course was ever
controlled by a sound Judgment; he was honest
and Just, and was never known to falter hi
the discharge of his duties. Socially he was
all one could desire as a companion, and as
a man he was generous to a fault, unassuming,
gentle, true and unselfish.
It Is .therefore ordered that out of respect
to the memory of Captain . John Spillane this
court do now adjourn. '

Xnv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Dec 22. â Interest la the stock
market converged \-*ry largely in the shares
cf tbe local transportation companies. Thess
issues were very stroxur and active on an
nouncement of a virtual conclusion of negotia
tions w&ereby tho . Metropolitan Street Rail
way Company and Its allied interests come
k under control cf th< Interborough Rapid Tran
w sit Company, thus giving the latter interests
practically a monopoly of all the traction
:*;<-::: t'.-s on Manhattan Island. Some sort of
a deal Involving these Important properties
has been, expected for a long tirr.Â«, but its
exact form was always a matter of idle specu
tl&tion. Tbe exact details of the deal were
not obtainable /during market hours to-day,
but enough was learned to Indicate that the
cc&nsfer would be effected en terms satlsfac
lory to the purchasers. Tbe new interests in
Metropolitan are said to Include several promi
nent individuals Identified with the Pennsyl
vania and other great railway systems. So
'.e.r &c could bÂ« learned the Brooklyn Rapid
Traosit Company Is not Included in th* deal,
as It now stands, but the fact that represen
tatives of that company wÂ«re -In conference
with the new Metropolitan Interests to-day
was regarded as more than a mere coincidence.
Change of control of Metropolitan is said to
carry with it imj&ortant concessions \u25a0tn the
way ot proposed subway extensions. It Is not
unlikely t'-at new securities will be Issued for
these outstanding in the nsxao of the Metro
â¢ ;>t>Utan comjjany. At any rate It is understood
the transfer from old to new Interests will
. involve a comparatively email cash outlay. The
tractions ltd the market from tbe outset, thou
sands ot wh*rtÂ» ot \u25a0 MeCropolltAtt Street Kali
way and Metropolitan Securities coining with
initial wins of 2 to 4 points. Interborough
opened on the curb with an advance of over
b iMints and was the . feature of that market
throughout attaining a new high record. Net
trains of these issues Jor the day were 2H>for
Metrcplltan Street Railway. 41% for Metropoli
tan Securities and S for Interborough. Trans
actions In Â«MÂ»pe stocks as a group constituted
the major' portion \u25a0 of the day's business, al
thourh the general market later b*canie
broad end active in the faoe of a 16 per cent
money rate. ThÂ» prevailing rate of the day.
however â¢ was nearer 8 - per cent. Shares of
the Pennsylvania Railway and subsidiary com
i.Eni-Â°s including Reading. Baltimore and Ohio,
Chesapeake and Ohio. Norfolk and Western and
Pittsburgh Cincinnati. Chicago and St. I*oula
were especially Btrong. Union Pacific went to
a new high record and an . active demsjid for
southern Pacific advanced that stock a point,
Si. Paul and the â¢ Northwestern* and Atchlsons
i-anlclpating in the day's general advances.
The only l-.lgh-class railway issue to display
fc wrakneti was nnnola Central. Asids from
"the movements In' Sugar and Virginia -Carolina
ohemlcal. there were no noteworthy move
ments in the industrial group. Surprise wss
rxtresscd at the failure of the United States
Steel issues to make more immediate response
to tl>f- fÂ£vcrable trade conditions. The mar
ket reacted slightly in the last hour, but ral
lied in the final trading and the closing was
j=tr<cuf. London was scarcely a factor here,
trad ing in less than 18,000 shares, practically
a'l sales. Forecasts of the week's money '
movements point to a small gain by the banks,
d*Â«r>K* the very heavy outflow.
BondÂ« were steady. Total salts (par value).

// Poultry, and Game.
. The "demand Tfor dressed Turkeys did not
come up. to expectations and there was general
complaint . among .wholesalers of the small vol
ume 01 trade. The market opened with buyers
and sellers apart, â¢ the ' latter, being firm in their
: views, as the receipts were comparatively light
and, the cold weather was favorable for keeping
the -stock.. In the. early trade ; several sales
\ were, consummated at 23c per. pound for Gob
: biers 'and 24c for fine Hens, but as buying was
\ slow at : those figures sellers were obliged to
cut prices,; and in \u25a0 the ; afternoon 23c was gen
erally regarded as an extreme figure, with sec
ond .quality stock selling . down to - 20c. This
proportion of Hens In the receipts was small,
and they were , relatively firmer than Gobblers.
The market closed easy, witn a heavy carry -
over.': Early prrivals aggregated 150 tons and
there were numerous sma.it. lots received later
.in the day. "Live Turkeys were quiet and lower.
Other kinds of -Poultry remained steady, with
desirable . off erings of Chickens selling readily
at stiff prices. \u25a0 . ' -\u25a0-' '. .

Batter, Cheese and Ess*<
The decline of Sc in ranch. Eggs of Thursday
was evidently' too rapid, for the market recov
ered :lc s yesterday, notwithstanding continued
free receipts and sufficient supplies. - Dealers
say that the main cause of the increase tn sup
plies of the ranch -Eggs- W the very poor de
mand.; as the public are not taking them, even
at the | sharply reduced quotations. The very
cold weather, which tends to check the produc
tion. Is not sufficient to offset this indifference
on the part of the public, who are still con
suming Eastern and cold storage goods. Be
sides there are a good many lower grade Eggs
e-n-the market.^ ,_:..
- ThÂ« Butter market, though no higher. Is very
stiff, \u25a0\u25a0 with stocks getting very meager, and
dealers are predicting a further advance. The
Humboldt \u25a0 district is now .at -Its .lowest pro
ducing point lnV the year,- and the production
of Marin County, which usually steps in and
fills the gap, is not doing it this year, owing
to the very cold weather and the lack of green
feed. \u25a0 ' . ; â¢ â¢;

.There.was a fair amount of trading in fresh
fruits, as deaJers were purcnaslng rather, freely
of desirable Btock In expectation of & brisk de
mand au'rlng'the h&lldays. / targe sizes or Na
vel Oranges and Grape Fruit 'were still scarce
and continued to . command' firm prices,' and
some " handlers reported a little â¢â¢ better move
ment in small sizes of tho former, but at low
prices.' T A feature of 'the market was the ar
rival of a straight. carload of fancy large Na
vels, which :. waa readily marketed at the flat
rate of $3 per box. ' In the Apple market fancy
stock continued to meet with a" fair demand at
well sustained, prices; while cheap stock" re
ceived but, little attention.' Several small con
signments, of choice Grapes were received and
found prompt sale at stiff prices. 'Carried* over
stock was ' offering freely, but found "few buy

report and sent it to Governor Pardee.
. Conditions are found to be very satis-;
factory, according to the report. | Mer
chants have taken care that none of "the
children employed shall be \u25a0. Injured by
their, work." -. All of the ; children em-;
ployed ln ! San Francisco (there are 1041
of them) have their school certificates.
They work from nine to ten hours per
