Boston Operator Issues Statement
Announcing That He Intends to
Continue Stock War.
BOSTON. Dec. 16.â Colonel William
C Greene of New York, who last week
accused Thomas W. Lawson of this
â¢Hy of being responsible for the re
cent break in copper shares, came to
Boston to-day and was met at the
Hotel Touraine by Lawson. ' The na
ture of the statements issued by both
Colonel Greene and Lawson, but partic
ularly by Coionel Greene, who consid
ered that Lawson was to blame for the
raid upon the stock of the Greene Con
solidated Copper Company together
.with the market developments of the
past few davs. all had combined to
euggest th*Â» possibility of a clash be
tween the two operators.
So far as became known, however,
nothing of the kir.d took place and
Colonel Greene returned to New York
on the 5 o'clock train this afternoon
after having been in conference with
Lawson from 3:45 a. m.
-Interest was added to the incident
through the pressure of police head
quarters inspectors.
REACH AX UNDERSTANDING.
After Colonel Greene had left, a
member of a prominent Boston brok
erage firm, who attended the confer
ence, issued a. statement which he said
had been assented to by'Colonel Greene
end Lawsna.. - . - _^*'-i,' > - .; - *
The substantial part of the" state
ment was that Lawson had called upon
Colonel Greene at the hotel, after
learning that Greene was in -Boston,
that Greene had maintained at the con
ference that the recent breaks in the
etÂ©ck were due to the public utter
ances of Lawson; that the colonel felt
toeenly the decline in certain stocks in
â¢which he was interested and that Law
eon had maintained in answer to Col
onel Greene that he had done nothing
to bring: about any fall in the stocks
In which Colonel Greene was interest
eft. The statement concluded with the
Words:
"Each gentleman has a perfect un
'derEtanding of the other's position.
There is nothing further to state of
.public interest."
CALLS ON GREENE.
Colonel Greene had publicly adver
tised that he would call on Lawson,
but Lawson anticipated this by appear
ing at the Hotel Touraine early in the
forenoon. Colonel Greene had not fin
ished his breakfast, and when the Bos
ton man eent in his card the colonel
cent out wcrd that he would meet him
e/ter breakfast. The New York pro
moter emerged from the dining-room
with -a friend walking on either side. At
the same time Lawson, who had been
talking freely with a group of news
paper men, stepped forward half-way
to. meet the New Yorker. Lawson
eeemed constrained, but Colonel Greene
smiled warmly, uttered a cordial salu
tation and extending his hand, which
Lawson seized, invited the Boston op
erator to his room. Colonel Greene's
manner seemed very happy, but Law
eon was apparently perturbed.. The men
tvere in conference in Colonel Greene's
room for almost seven-' hours, all out
siders and messages of every kind be
ing excluded. Meantime the police had
arrived and virtually taken possession
of the hotel, three officers in citizens'
clothes patrolling the corridor upon
trfclch Colonel Greene's rooms were lo
cated, while Chief Inspector -Watts
end other detectives remained on guard
In the lobby. At the end of -the confer
ence La-.vson and CoJonel Greene made
a hurried exit from the hotel, the latter
being driven at once to the railroad
station.
LAWSON ISSUES STATEMENT.
Lawson issued the following to-night,
confirming the statement given out ear
lier and adding that the episode was
ended: .
â¢ "There wap no business of any name
or nature done or attempted by either
Colonel Greene or myself, and there
was nothing more than the things I
mention herein that I am not willing
the press or the public should know.
Nothing took place in which I would
not have been willing for the press to
take part. I stated to Colonel Greene
that I had not been in any way raiding
or attempting to raid his stock, or in
any way to injure him. but that what
I "have been doing against the Standard
Oil party and 'the system* I would con
tinue to do regardless of what he or
others thought or did.
"The stories afloat that I called on
Colonel Greene by agreement or that I
was accompanied by detectives or other
protectors is all rot. I called at hi*
ho^el without his knowledge, or any
other person's knowing that I would
call.
"Nothing that ha? happened In the
entire Greene episode has in any way
altered my !>lans or affected my inten
tions. I will proceed with my work and
await the next episode."

PRETORIA, Transvaal. Dec. 16.â Two
thousand burghers attended an impres

the burial of the body of former Presi
dent Kruger. Several ministers of the
Dutch churches spoke, all eulogizing
the ex-President for his exemplary re
ligious life and as a lover of his people,
and exhorting the Boers, while remain
ing loyal to the new flag, never to for
get the principles of their late leader
of their own language. . â v
An immense crowd filed through the
death chamber throughout the morn
ing. The coffin was draped with the
Transvaal. and Orange Free State flags,
and on it were the tributes of Queen
"Wilhelmina and the Queen mother of
Holland.
The da*' was gloomy and overcast,
but an immense crowd of Britons and
Boers filled the square opposite the hall,
to which the remains were removed
after the church services. Many Boers
had trekked long distances to attend
the obsequies of their former leader.
Britons met the men of the veldt and
mingled on the friendliest of terms.
The Afrikander party was officially rep
resented by deputations from Cape Col
ony. Orange River and Natal. At the
hall SDeeches of eulogy were delivered
by Generals Louis Botha, Schalkburger
and -Christian Dewet. - General" Botha
read aMetter. from Kruger < exhorting
them to*; preserve the Boer - national
spirit. .:â¢;;.- ..-.. ... âº' . ' -.. . -â  -. ..
General Botha's speech strongly rec

races in South Africa, as that is the
only means by which they can -become
a great people and realize Kruger's
ideal.
The procession after the ceremony
was composed of fully 1200 persons,
while the route through which it passed
was thronged with people. Flags were
half-masted, bells tolled and under
Government orders minute guns were
fired at the military depot. Around the
grave, where Kruger was laid beside
his wife, were gathered relatives, Boer
leaders and many prominent person
ages, Including Sir Richard Solomon,
representing the British Government.
By the "King's special request a salute
of twenty-one guns was fired as the
coffin was lowered Into the grave..

from Stockholm reporting that ar
rangements have been made by Crown
Prince Gustavus Adolphus to meet
Alice Roosevelt at the house of White

taking the first step toward offering
his heart and hand. It is well known
that Gustavus has' been looking for a
bride in the courts of Europe during
the past year, but unsuccessfully.
Prince Gustavus was found* in an au

of purchasing a new machine. . 1
"Yes," he said, agreeably. "I am
going to London, but from that to get

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 16.â Three men
were burned to death about 6 o'clock

" KEITH, carpenter.
The fire started from the explosion
of a tank of distillate, andHhe flames
spread so quickly that within a few
minutes the entire plant was ablaze.
There were about eighteen men at
work in the mill at- the time and all
escaped but the three who were
burned to death. It is not known why
the three victims did not make their
escape with the other fifteen men, but
it is supposed they were at ,work on
the second floor and were cut' off from
all means of | escape before they real
ized their danger. The bodies were re
covered after the fire had been extin
guished. They were burned beyond
recognition.
Three small cottages adjacent to the
mill were also burned. The total loss
will be about $20,000.

Borrows Money Upon a Fictitious Estate
Lieutenant Paul H. McDonald, Tenth
Infantry, te the latest gay young army
officer who " is -to be called up before
a court-martiai. &; I- fey; 'â¢ '
He said he had an estate of $50,
000 coming to him. On his prospects
he, borrowed money. . The estate,
however, only consisted of two horses.
For these misrepresentations he is
now under ..arrest at Fort Lawton,
Wash. Y . :
'.'He .is also accused of , duplicating
his pay "accounts, and - must also an
swer charges of borrowing money from
his brother officers under false pre
tenses. .'
'Lieutenant McDonald arrived at the
Presidio early last June. He was
bright, sparkling and dashing, and im
mediately made a hit with the officers
of the post with whom he came in con
tact. He was jolly and gay and soon
formed acquaintances in the | down
town set. Society also smiled upon him
and he was welcomed to many of the
homes of the- 400. - The whirl of the
crimson-lighted portion of the town
also held out inducements to the gay
young office^. â¢ :
Here he is reported to have reveled
along with the merry ihrongr that liked
small bottles, cold birds and automo
bile rides in .â  the soft light of
dawn. -â 'â â â  â â 'â .>
Now. a second lieutenant's pay is all
very well as far as it goes, but it
doesn't go far after, the officer leaves
thelimits of his post and wants to en-
* i y the gayeties of outside life. Mc-
Donald suddenly found his funds de
pleted. His creditors were pressing
him to "the limit. He could not turn
around. that he did. not find -a bill or
a collector staring him in'the face.
Suddenly he devised a scheme to raise
funds." One morning' he announced that
his father had just died and left him
an estate valued at about $50,000. On
the strength 'of- this statement he com
menced â¢ ; to <? borrow â¢ money * right and

.A few. .weeks ago his ' creditors de
manded a settlement. Upon investiga
tion .they found out to their amazement
that the $50,000 estate was a myth, and
that air.the estate that had -gone to
McDonald was two horses. This an
nouncement caused a great sensation
here, as -the claims of his creditors
amounted to something like $5000.
In the meantime McDonald is under
arrest at Fort Lawton; and his broth
er omcers here are preparing to pay
the notes they indorsed for him at the

RUSSIAN HEADQUARTERS. MUK
DEN. Dec. lfi.â There was considerable,
desultory firing on both sides to-day.
The Japanese made an advance, but
It proved to be only a demonstration.
Nijrht s-crtics continue. ar,<- a curious
melee r^s-nlted last night from a simul
taneous advance of both Russian? and
Japa rezc. Two columns of Japanese,
takins: a'-Ivantap* of the darkness, ad
varxed on the Russian positions and
at the -a me time a Russian column
pet out f<>r th* village of Nanganza.
Th* nussfam column heard the Jap-.
enese f rinjr in the direction of their
bate and thought they had been dis
covered, but held ' Narganra - Avhile
tappers mined and then retired. The
Japanese re-entered the village, where
they were greeted with a tremendous
explosion^ which killed many of them.
In the meantime the two Japanese
columns operating in th<! direction of
the Rvtssi&ns heard the* explosion and
thought they had been outflanked,
â whereupon they retired. The Japanese
and Russians met as each side was
returning. Bott- were utterly sur
prised. A ha ml -to -hand scuffle in the
darkness endued, but as it was impos
sible to 'listinguish friend from foe
probably little damage was done. The
Russian less was only one.
On the night of December 14 fourteen
Russian scouts penetrated to the vil
lage of Fanshan, where they destroyed
b. Japanese signal tower and carried
cfT an old bell which had been used by
the jJaparese to signal the approach

CHINESE IX SAD PLIGHT.
Starving Asiatics Around Mukden Un
able to Secure Relief.
PEKING. Dec. 16. â Owing to the
fact that there are about 30.000 home
less Chinese in and around Mukden
as one result of the Russo-Japanese
war. rich Chinese here and at Tien
tsin have subscribed funds to provide
v.arm clothing and food for these poor
people. Out of these funds about 30,
000 skin coats have been purchased
and made ready at Tientsin for dis
patch to Mukden. The Japanese mil
itary authorities, however, fearing
that the Russians would benefit by
these gifts, refuse to allow them to
be sent to the Russian lines and
threaten to confiscate them If cap
tured. The Russians, it has been
learned, promise to refrain from tak
ing the advantage feared by the Jap
anese, but the latter decline to ac
< ept this assurance and the result
must be disastrous to. 'the Chinese,
whose villages and crops have been
destroyed and who are suffering from
i scarcity of both food and fuel. .
In Chinese circles here muchfdis

Food and Ammunition
for Port Arthur.
CHEFU. ,. Dec. 16, 5 p. m,â Seven
Russians in civilian garb but with a
military training obvious, in- their
bearing arrived to-day In an open sail
boat carrying dispatches. ' They were
unwilling to talk and .went immedi
ately to the Russian consulate. '. -A
high wind enabled them to make a
quick passage from Port- Arthur.
The Russians confirm the truthful
ness of the" official Japanese reports
which told of the sinking of several
ships of the Russian fleet. They say
that the Japanese. would have been
able to accomplish this at any time
during the past two months, but that
apparently they preferred to use their
guns against the forts. They express
the belief that the destruction of the
Russian ships indicates the abandon
ment by the Japanese of the hope of
capturing the fortress.
The Japanese, the Russians say,
have lost three torpedo-boats in the
past month, the last one sinking dur
ing the night attack of December 14.
â¢ According to thsse Russians the
fighting during which High Hill was
captured was terrific, that hill alone
costing the Japanese, casualties of 12,
000. The Japanese, they say, have
been unable to occupy the hill except
for purposes of observation and they
have taken none of the main forts.
During the past fortnight three
steamers laden with ammunition and
provisions succeeded in running the
blockade and the Russians have high
hopes that the fortress will* be able to
hold out for many months..
The Japanese, these Russians al
lege, are depressed because of their
unsuccessful sacrifice of the lives of
their men.
The sailboat bearing the Russians
left Port Arthur last night under
cover of a snowstorm and had a ter
rible time in crossing. The Russians
were nearly frozen when they reached
Chefu and were unable to leave the
boat \vithout assistance. They brought
a large number of dispatches.
A report from the commander of
the Japanese third squadron from To
kio Thursday said that early on the
morning of December 14 two flotillas
of torpedo-boats attacked the Russian
battleship Sevastopol. One of these
flotillas was unsuccessful, having been
exposed to the . Sevastopol's search
lights. The other reached the in
tended spot, but in the darkness one
of the torpedo-boats- composing the
flotilla became lost from its comrade
vessels. At the time the- comman'der's
report was filed, midnight of Decem
ber 14, this torpedo-boat, which was
commanded by" Lieutenant Xagata.
.had not returned and the -Japanese
were anxious concerning , her asafety^
This probably is the; boat , referred to
by the ' Russians, whose statement
would seem to confirm the belief that
she has gone down.: -.:-â â 
High Hill, mentioned in the Chefu
dispatch, may refer to 203-Meter Hill,
which was captured by the Japanese
on November 30, and from which they
bombarded and sank ' the Russian
warship*.. Dispatches received from
Port Arthur several weeks ago men
tioned High Mountain, which was de
ccribed as being 500 feet high, facing
Pigeon Bay and slightly south of Fort
Etse. /
COLD DELAYS OPERATIONS.
Freezing of "Wells Hampers Move
. ' menis mi Both Sides.
USANCHEX, Dec. 16.â Occasional ar
tillery firing is heard east of the rail
way.
The Russians yesterday captured two
Japanese who were in a pitiable con
dition. The prisoners grumbled greatly
at the Manchurian cold and said they
were glad to be fed and warmed.
The genera^ position is very uncer
tain. Movements on both sides are
hampered by the freezing of wells and
the lack of snow, which renders it
necessary to keep near the river for
water supply and near the coal mines
for fuel.
Brigandage is increasing.
There Is considerable want and suf
fering among the natives. Reporta
from Vladivostok state that the num
ber of eick in the hospitals there is
rapidly decreasing, and that there are
few cases of serious illness.

He Must Obey I)ictate3
"INDELICATE": OATHS
Woman Asks Not to Be Com
pelled to Repeat Them
Before Board of Inquiry
WASHINGTON-. Dec. 16.â The first
â¢witness in the Senator Smoot inquiry
to-day was Mrs. Annie Elliott of Price,
Utah. She is an .elderly Iadv, who
went- from Denmark to Utah" In 1872,
and left 'the Mormon church in 1896.
She was asked concerning the obliga
tions taken in the temple and was re
quested to repeat as much of the cere
monies as she could remember.
In a voice shaken with emotion, Mrs.
Elliott said that the obligations were
so indelicate she could not bear to re
peat them. Chairman Burrows told
her to take her own time and not to
be. embarrassed. The witness said
the first oa'th administered to those
who participated was that if they did
not want to go any further and take
the oaths they should turn back and
go out. ; ;
By slow degrees Mrs. Elliott. repeat
ed the oaths of vengeance and the
various penalties ascribed for reveal
ing any part of the ceremonies. Dur
ing her testimony concerning the pen
alties of mutilation of the body, the
witness trembled continuously and ap
peared to proceed with difficulty. After
saying that each person taking the
endowments agrees to have his or her
throat cut. Mrs. Elliott said it would
be impossible for her to go further.
At the request of Tayler. Mrs. El
liott described the garments worn by
Mormons who have taken the endow
ments. Senator Overman asked if ev
ery Morman in good standing is com
pelled to wear the- garments and the
witness said that all such Mormons
wear the garments as underclothing.
Looking at Senator Smoot. Senator
Overman asked the witness if she were
sure every Mormon in good standing
In the committee room had the gar
ments on.
"Yes, sir, they have." The reply pro
voked laughter and the witness re
peated: "I know they all have them
on." _>â :-,%â 
P>oraker asked the witness
If she had ever heard of the endow
ment house penalties being enforced
against any one. She said she had not.
Tayler asked if she expected to suf
fer by reason of. giving testimony here.
Mrs. Elliott said she expected that her
business would suffer.
CHURCH IX POLITICS.
Charles H. Jackson of Boise
Idaho, chairman of the Democratic
State Committee, testified at length
concerning the growing power of thÂ°
Mormon church and its interference
with State affairs, which, he said,-was
made the paramount issue by Demo
crats and Independents in the last
campaign !n Idaho. He said 'that
apostles. of. the church from Utah go
Into , Idaho: and -direct' the people how
'tp vote. .
'He told of the visit, of Apostle "John
Henry-Smith for the purppse of direct
ing legislation and said {hat the in
fluence of the church' : accomplished
the passage of the sugar bounty " bill."
This measure places a State bounty of
1 cent a pound on all sugar manufac
tured with'n the State in 1903 and a
half-cent a pound on all sugar manu
factured in J&04. It is estimated that
the bounty in 1903 amounted to $76,000
and; in 1904 to $150,000. There are four
refineries in thf. State, and President
Joseph Smith of the Mormon church
is president of three of them. The
fourth factory was constructed recent
ly and is controlled by Gentiles.
IX COXTROL OF IDAHO.
Speaking of the influence of the
church en the political affairs of the
State, Jackson took as an T'ustration
the defeat of Governor. Mori .son for a
second nomination. He declared' that
Governor . Morrison's administration
had been satisfactory to his Republi
can constituents, but that he ran>ioul
of the Mormon church and therefore
was denied a second term. In this con
nection Jackson, said with emphasis:
"It is impossible for any man or any
party to stand against the Mormon
church in Idaho." -
In describing; the present condition
of the State, Jackson said six of the
twenty-one counties are known as sol
idly Mormon and that, in all. of the
southern counties the Mormons are in
control, and in that way, he said, thu
church practically is in charge of the
Legislature," political conventions and
all gatherings at which- the delegates
are elected by the people.

datioii^Iade by Eooseyelt
WASHINGTON. Dec. 16. â The
Quarles-Cobper' bill; permitting the
Interstate', Commerce Commission to
flx railroad rates, â¢was, the subject of
a hearing to-day by' the Senate-,Com
mittee ,on interstate- Commerce, at
which Edward B. Bacon of Milwaukee,
chairman ' of . the : executive committee
of the Interstate Commerce Law Con
vention.'held last summer at St: Louis,
was the- principal' speaker. : In re
sponse to an interrogation: from Sena
tor Tillman, Bacon said he \yas .con
fident that the bill ' represents'" the
wishes of the business ; interests: in
providing for suspending the â¢ findings
of the commission in cases of appeal.
"Then," said Tillman, "you do not
agree with the President, who recom
mends that a : rate fixed , by the "com
mission shall go into immediate ef
fect." ' -.
Replying Vto questions by Senator
Cullom, Bacon said that,the shippers
vould prefer the suspension of rates
for sixty days pending an appeal, with
a time. limit on appeals, to giving un
limited .time and allowing the rates
to go into effect immediately. He said
in response to Senator Elkins that in
case it should be ultimately decided
tttftt the rate fixed by the commission
;wis too low, the railroads would have
ho â¢ recourse on. account of the loss
sustained, but he agreed with Senator
Tillman- that such a condition would
be no worse on the railroads than
would a rate that is too high would
be on the shippers.
H. R. Fuller, representing the rail
road labor organizations, made an
argument j against the bill relieving
narrow-gauge roads from some of thfe
requirements of the safety appliance
law. . .

WASHINGTON. Dec. 16.â The Senate
to-day by a vote of 44 to 23 passed the
Philippine civil government bill. The
final vote was preceded by the presen
tation of many amendments and a
general discussion of them, as, well as
of the provisions of the bill. The dis
cussion was confined. generally, to the
merits of the measure. On some of

pine and Porto Rican. Governments;
authorizes municipalities in the Philip

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 16.â JV number of
San Diegans are exercised over the dis
appearance of Dr. J. C. Peltier, who,
according to the complaint made to the
police, has worked a smooth game here.
Dr. Peltier came here supposedly for
the purpose of opening a drug business
on Logan' avenue and started opera
tions by Inducing two well-known citi
zens to give him.personal note*, which,
he claimed, he wished to use as securi
ty in purchasing a supply of drugs.
One of the men let him have two notes,
one for $100 and the other for $125. The
doctor's landlady says that she loaned
him $60 with which to purchase his
drugs. A cripple, who goes about in a
self-propelled wheel-chair, says he
paid the doctor $75 in advance for
treatment. The doctor left*, for the
north Monday, presumably to purchase
his goods, and was to return Wednes
day, but failed to do so. The departure
on Wednesday of the doctor's daughter
alarmed his creditors.

That His Treatment Was
â¢ Virtually a Dismissal
MADRID, Dec 16.â King Alfonso
has approved the new Cabinet, which
is as follows: Premier and Minister of
Marine, General Azcarraga; Minister
of Finance, Senor Castellano; Minister
cf Interior, Senor Vardillo; Minister
of Foreign Affairs. Marquis Agnila de

It is said that Premier Arcarraga will
enly act as Minister of Marine in the
absence of Admiral Vinieyre, who has
accepted the portfolio.
Premier Azcarraga announces that
he will continue the policy of his
.predecessors. Silvela and Maura, but
his tenure of office is expected to be
brief. The new Cabinet is not consid
Â«red a strong one. Former Premiers
Maura, and Villaverde have promised
their support to the new Cabinet, but
their friends refused to accept port
folios in it.
Several newspapers declare that
former Premier Maura considers him

It has been known for the past month
at tho Palace that General Lono,
former Military Governor, had been
selected for Chief of Staff and the
King's advocacy of General Polavieja
for the post was equivalent to the dis

FRESH FROM SCENE OF HOSTILITIES
Men Who Have Been Taking Part in the War Drama
of the Orient Arrive on the Mongolia.
Henry B. Miller, United States Consul
General at Newchwang, was among the
distinguished passengers arriving on
the steamship Mongolia yesterday, and
during his short stay in this city he is
living at the Palace. Consul, General
Miller is home on a sick leave. He left
Newchwang on October 26, and spent a
month in Japan before continuing his
homeward journey. From here he ex
pects to go to his old home and will
then visit Washington, which he ' fig
ures reaching aUut the middle of Jan
uary.
Miller was stationed in Newchwang
about > four years as a Consul, . but
shortly after the outbreak "of tire Japa
nese-Russian war he was promoted to
the position of Consul General in recog
nition of his services performed in pro
tecting the interests of Americans and
other foreigners In that section of Man
churia. Although his headquarters was
at Newchwang, Miller's jurisdiction as
Consul General extended to Port Ar
thur, Dalny, Harbin and Mukden. Some
months ago the United States appoint
ed Consuls to Dalny. Harbin and Muk
den, but as yet the new American rep
resentatives have not been able to ta~:<i
their positions.
CONSUL GIVES PROTECTION.
At the outbreak of the Japanese-
Russian war Consul General Miller fig
ured most prominently in the evacua
tion of Xewchwang by the Russians
and the occupation of the city by the
Japanese. Through his good offices con
flict between the warring nations at
Newchwang was diplomatically avoid
ed, and through this fact he gained
favor of the two armies. Discussing
his experiences last evening he said:
"At the evacuation a great deaJ of
tact was required to prevent a clash.
Realizing that the Japanese would
surely occupy Newchwans, General
Kuropatkin ordered the Russians to
withdraw from the city, over which
they had held political control. When
they withdrew, 1, as senior Cousul, was
called upon to arrange a temporary
government for the city pending the
arrival of the Japanese. On the night
the latter arrived I entertained the re
tiring Russian Consul at a dinner and
while this function was in progress my
friend, the British consul, was like
wise entertaining the Japanese officers
and as the two dinners proceeded we
were able quietly to effect a transfer
without the least friction. Between
February S and July 26 I had charge of
a number of Japanese in Xewchwang,
about 3000 in all, and in getting them
out of the city I found the Russians
most helpful and kindly disposed
toward my plan. When the Japanese
began to arrive I performed a similar
act for the Russian residents of the
city and must say that the Japanese
acted in a most cordial manner toward
me and gave me every possible aid.
CHINESE POLICE MUTIXY.
"The onfy battle we saw was the ar
tillery dud about sixteen miles from
Xewchwang, which lasted from July
22 to July 25. We got word that the
Russians were to withdraw from
Xewchwang, and the following morn
ing they. had all left. Th"e next thing
we knew the 300 Chinese police of the
city, wearing the insignia 'Yim Kow'
(Russian police) on their coat sleeves,
had destroyed their badges of office,
openly mutinied and proceeded to loot
the town. The first public building
they attacked was the police station,
tvhich th'.y sacked from basement to
roof, and then robbed other public
buildings. Meanwhile a detachment of
rive Japanese 6couts had ridden Into
the city and stationed themselves at
the entrance of the main public build
ing. They, however, were not in com
mand of an officer and refused to take
charge, fully appreciating: that they
were not vested with authority.
"The foreigners, however, organized
a temporary government under my di
r<Krtion, . arms und ammunition were
distributed among them and we pro
ceeded to establish peace within the
city. This work was quickly effected
â¢with the aid of the Chinese guilds, and
finally the coolie police, after having
had their coat sleevesdecoratedwith an
other insignia. 'Jim' Kow" (Japanese
police), assumed a grave air and again
took up their peaceful duties, guard
ing the very places which they had
previously robbed of everything that
was valuable. .
"We could hear the sound of can
nonading in tho distance as the war
proceeded, and particularly during: the
battle of Kai Chow, twenty-five miles
boyond Newchwang, but saw very lit-

tie of the belligerents and learned little
of the progress of the strife."
: AID GIVEN TO REFUGEES, h
Consul-General Miller, as president
of the International Red Cross and
Refugee Aid Society, which was sup
ported mainly by the Chinese guilds
of Shanghai, devoted much of his en
ergy to aiding Chinese in Manchuria,
out of which country thousands of
Chinese were sent during the early part
of the war. In this work Miller said
last night he was greatly assisted by
the Scotch and Irish Presbyterian mis
sions of the Orient, which loaned their
physicians and hospitals. After the
battle of Liaoyong the society cared for
300 wounded and several thousand
Chinese refugees, " At Mukden about
3000 refugees were assisted out of Man
churia.
Concerning the probable outcome of
the war Consul-General Miller declined
to make any statement, fearing that
any opinion he might volunteer would
be regarded in a political light. Re
ferring to the firm stand being made
at Port Arthur he said It was general
ly understood in Manchuria that the
Russian forces in the harbor were
amply provided with provisions, for it
was a notorious fact that the smug
gling of contraband had been going
on for many months. In fact it was
generally known that many thousands
of small Chinese junks were engaged in
carrying contraband into Port Arthur.
A great deal of this traffic, which the
Russians encouraged by offering bis
bonuses, originated for a time at
Xewchwang, but of late the Japanese
had discouraged it. The confidence ot
the Japanese in their ability to cap
ture Port Arthur by land forces had
apparently made them 'indifferent to
the fact that food was being continual
ly conveyed by way of the coast to
the besieged Russians.
SAYS KCROKI IS ALIVE.
Captain Peyton C. , March of the
general staff of the United States
army, one of the officers selected by
the department to accompany the Jap
anese army In the field for the pur
pose of taking military observations,
returned yesterday on the liner Mon
golia. Captain March brings absolute
refutation of the report that General
Kuroki was killed by a Russian shell.
"In several of the -reports' I -' have
seen," said Captain March yesterday,
"General Kuroki is said to have been
killed on October 5. All the reports
agree as to the date, so I suppose they
are all children of the. same original,
and, I am glad to say, mistake"n, ru
mor. I was 'with General Kuroki. on
that day and every day until I left the
front, November 30, when I started
for home. He is far from being dead.
Although exposed on numerous occa
sions he sustained no hurt and is one
of the healthiest men I ever met. Ku
roki is particularly keen and ener
getic. He Inspires his officers and
men with his own enthusiasm and his
death would be a serious loss."

with him a wholesome respect for the
little brown men.
"Any nation on earth," he declares,
"that undertook to whip Japan' would
have Its hands full."
Captain March was assigmed to Gen
eral Kuroki's army and from May 1
until November 3*0 shared the for
tunes of .that branch of the Mikado's
forces. He witnessed many engage
ments, among them the famous artil
lery duels which marked the long and
bitter battle of Liaoyang. The Jap
anese, he says, have artillery much
inferior to -that- of the Russians, but
the daring of the little brown men
more than made up for what their
guns lacked in range. â , x â 
Captain March' has -many* friends
In San Francisco.;. His first visit here
was when he came through as colonel
of the Astor Battery. He brought
those curled darlings " safely home
while the trouble in the Philippines
was still young. He returned to the
Philippines later an(T rendered dis
tinguished service in" some of the
hardest campaigning seen in the isl
ands. America now has only two mil
itary representatives with the Japan
ese army. Colonel Crowder is with
Kuroki and Major Kuhn is at Toklo
waiting for the Japanese Government
to send him to the front.
J. Azevedo Castello Branco, Portu
gal's representative at the Chinese cap
ital, was also on the passenger list of
the Mongolia.
Major Inagaki is a member of the
staff of Marquis Oyama, the command
er in chief of the Japanese army. From
the beginning of the war he has been
attached to General Kuroki's army and
has been in two battles and many skir
mishes. Inagaki is a type of the best
quality of Japanese officers. Small of
stature, erect, alert and athletic, his
eyes snao with enthusiasm when he
speaks of the struggle in which he took
part. He speaks volubly and with ap
parent eagerness to tell all he knows,
but he says little' and answers direct
questions with a Japanese, smile. Ina
gaki has a fine record as a soldier and
is now on his way to London as mili
tary attache to the Japanese embassy
there.

Thomas P. Dorris was mate of the

Harry Struve, once commander of the

Si Shan was owned by Louis Spltzel of
Shanghai, and in October is said to
have run the blockade into Port Arthur
with 300,000 rifles and eighty-five* head
of cattle. After unloading her cargo at
Port Arthur she proceeded to New
chwang, where the Japanese seized
her. She was taken to the naval sta
tion at Sasebo, but after twenty-two
days* detention was released, the Japa
nese being unable to get sufficient evi
dence of the Port Arthur trip. Struve,
Dorris and all on board were held in
close surveillance at Sasebo. The ves

CHINESE IGNORE
COMMISSIONERS
Refuse to Answer Summons
of Police Board on the
Advice of Their Attorney
QUESTION AUTHORITY
Asiatic Keepers of Gambling
Places Declare They Cannot
Be Compelled to Testify
The right of the Board of Police Com
missioners to proceed with its investi
gation of the charges of bribery in
Chinatown was put in issue in an un
locked for manner yesterday. Its effect
was swift, and after a whispered con
sultation the members of the board de
cided that it was best not to press the
question too far without looking the
ground over thoroughly, and an ad
journment until next Wednesday even
ing, the regular meeting night of the
board, was abruptly ordered.
When j the commission met yesterday
afternoon to proceed with the hearing
of the bribery case Sergeant of Police
Jesse Cook was directed to serve sub
penas on Chin Kim You and Chim
Buck Guy, keepers of gambling places
at 820 and 820% Washington street, the
raid of which places by Commissioner
Hutton resulted in the present investi
gation. Cook found the two Chinese
without difficulty, and under authority
of the subpenas informed them that he
would forthwith remove them before
the commission to testify.
The Chinese ruled differently, how
ever. They demanded the right to tele
phone to Attorney George D.^ Collins,
their legal representative, for instruc
tions. Sergeant Cook saved them this
trouble by telephoning himself to Col
lins, informing him of the situation.
"In the first place the' Police Commis
sion has no authority to issue subpe
nas," said Collins to Cook over the tel
ephone, "and in the second place you
have no right to remove these men be
fore the commission even if the sub
penas were* authoritative. If you re
move the Chinese from their places I
will swear out a warrant for your ar
rest for false imprisonment of my cli
ents, and will also demand the arrest
of the entire commission on the same
charge. I have instructed my clients
not to testify before the commission in
this matter, and trouble will be avoided
if you convey my message to the com
mission."
Sergeant Cook called a policeman to
keep an eye on the Chinese and hur
ried to the rooms of the Police Commis
sion, where he laid the situation before
them in whispers. The commission.
Chief Wittman and Sergeant Cook
continued their whispered consultation
for some' minutes, and then Hutton
abruptly said, "The commission stands
adjourned until next Wednesday night.*'
It was apparent that the Chinese
had won their point but how the spec
tators did not know. As soon as the
meeting adjourned Commissioner How
ell called on Attorney Collins for a
further explanation of the stand he
had taken regarding the subpenas.
"It is my contention," said Collins
to Howell, "that the Police Commission
has no power to enforce recognition of
a subpena. In my opinion the .Police
Commission has no power to punish for
contempt for such disobedience, of .its
mandate; that It is a body of form
only and is without substance. I have
now brought this question to an is
"sue. . If you assume that you have such
power you -may cite me or one of my
clients for contempt and'we will carry
the auestlon to a decision.
"Granting, however, that the Police
Commission has, the power to compel
attendance at Investigation regularly
conducted, it would have no such pow
er in the presefht case, for the board is
not proceeding legally. It must first
make specific charges of bribery
against some member of the depart
ment and then disclose facts as they
may exist at the trial of the accused.
In any event I shall Instruct my clients
to continue to disobey your subpenas,
and I am confident that I will be up
held if the question goes to the courts
for decision."
Howell made no attempt to break
down the force of this argument and In
consequence much interest attaches to
the next meeting of the board, when it
will define its stand on the issue thus
raised.

wick wil!, from now until the time of
her trial or arraignment in court, be
rigidly excluded from all visitors and
s even her son and nurse will be denied
permission to see her except on the
â written order of United States Marshal
Chandler.
This afternoon an order was received
at the jail by Sheriff Barry from Unit
ed States Judge Wing of Toledo, direct
ing Barry to deny all people the privi
lege of seeing her. Barry at once or
dered that the nurse, Freda Swan
strom. who was then in the jail with
Sirs. Chadwlck, to leave. This action
was in direct opposition t6 an order of
United States Marshal Chandler Issued
yesterday, in which he directed that
Emil Hoover, the son of Mrs. Chad
wick, and the nurse, should be admit
ted at any time to see the accused
woman.
The order of Judge Wing put an
end to the episodes at the jail and
Mrs. Chadwlck's attorneys declared
this afternoon that there would be no
further developments in the legal end
of the case until Mrs. Chad wick was
brought ir.to the court either for ar
raignment or trial.
M. F. Bramler, a wealthy contrac
tor, called on Mrs. Chadwlck just prior
to the receipt of Judge Wing's order,
with Shelden Kerruish. one of Mrs.
Chadwick's. attorneys. He was asked
if he was going to give bail for her and
said he was not. When asked if he
intended to furrish money for the ex
pense of her defense, he laughed, but
did not reply.
PITTSBURG. Dec. 16.â In a tele
gram to the Pittsburg Dispatch Mrs.
Cassie L. Chadwick denies that she H
Indebted to any Pittsburg bank. Th -
telegram says: "Kindly deny report
that I owe money to any Pittsburg
bank. I don't owe them one dollar."

TO WAR ON
CONSUMPTION
The women of the California Club
have started a movement to urge the
coming Legislature to establish a State
sanatorium for the treatment and cure
bf consumption.- The lawmakers will
be asked to appropriate funds to build
one or more institutions similar to those
that . have successfull combated tu
berculosis In Germany. A number of
the Eastern States already have such
projects under way, and the California
Club has energetically taken hold of the
good work in this State.
- In a circular that has been issued to
the public by the club it Is set forth
that one person out of every nine In
the United States dies of tuberculosis,
that the disease is communicable, pre
ventable and in its earlier stages cura
ble. Safeguarding of the community is
urged. The economic gain to the com
munity by the prevention and cure of
the dread disease will be a strong ar
gument before the Legislature.
The following resolution of the Cali
fornia Club is incorporated in its ap
peal for support:
Whereas, it is the sense of the California
Club Hhat State and municipal laws should be
enacjed whereby tho spread of tuberculosis
In all Its forms may be prevented and where
by there shall be inaugurated a systematic
education of thÂ« public In the care, treatment
and prevention of the disease, and whereby
State sanitoria shall be established for ths
scientific treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis;
and
WherÂ«as. the California Club it preparing,
under the best legal and medical advice, a bill
carrying a reasonable appropriation for the
above named purposes, to be introduced in th*
cumins Legislature of this State; therefore,
be it
Resolved, In view of these facts, that the
California Club dees hereby call "upon th^
people of this State to do all In their power
to secure Ihe passage of this bill and to rr.ak*
personal appeals to legislators for prompt and
favorable action in Its b*half. %

citizen, and his stepson. Cromwell

He then came Into Tangier and re

REPAYS BENEFACTOR'S AID
BY PLUNDERING HIS TRUNK
Ingrate Displays Stoicism
Calmly Gazes at Witnesses Who
Disclose His Character.
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
With remarkable stoicism A. Martiny,
classified as "Al bum" and accused of
petty larceny, heard his character va
riously assailed before Police Judge Ca
baniss. "Thief" and "ingraie". were
among the mildest terms applied to
him, ret he evinced no more personal
interest than if they were allusions to
the Czar of Russia 'or the Mikado of
Japan.
The complaining witness. Max Schulz,
bartender of a Commercial street "wine
joint." lold'how he had showered
gratuities of cast-off clothing and food J
and ardent spirits on the defendant,
who seemed never to be going any
where else or coming from anywhere
else, but just spent his days and nights
loitering in the establishment over
which Mr. Schulz presided. And the
miserable fellow embraced the earliest
opportunity to rifle his benefactor's
trunk, abstracting therefrom and dis
posing cheaply of one coat and one
vest, both garments being 'of prevailing j
style and costly quality. But his mate
rial Ios3 grieved Mr. Schulz less than
the ingratitude manifested . in the pil
fering. Money could replenish his ward
robe, but ages could not heal his shat
tered confidence in mankind;
Then the arresting policeman averred
that the defendant's particular method
of not earning his livelihood, was beg
ging, and nobody believed he was pos
sessed of the immoral courage essential
to thievery until his guilt .of the trunk
breaking was established beyond shad
ow of doubt. While the proof enhanced
him In the esteem of his fellow vaga
bonds, it also lessened his popularity
by reflecting. on their acumen as read
ers of human character. Mr. Martiny
smiled at the paradoxâ the only relax
ation of feature he exhibited during the
trial. â¢
He had not much to say for himself.
"If them mugs had made up their
minds to cook him, he guessed he was
as good as cooked, all right; so what
was the use of wasting his breath?
They had the goods on him, and wasn't
that enough?"
Thirty days. : r ~: "
Judge Conlan promised to probe At
torney Bradford's allegation that his
client, Elkin Cohen, had been spirited
to and detained at the home of Max
Gutter, whom he had accused of swind
ling him by means of the gold brick
game. â¢
When the case was called for hearing
last Tuesday the complaining, witness
failed to appear, and his attorney dis
claimed knowledge of his whereabouts.
The defense ,asked for an order of dis
missal on the ground of the accuser's
non-appearance, but the Judge refused
it and ordered a continuance till Thurs
day. The same thing happened Thurs
day, the continuance being given till
yesterday and the Judge issuing a
bench warrant for Mr. Cohen's produc
tion in court. So yesterday Mr. Cohen
materialized in custody of two detec
tives, who reported they had found him
at Gutter's residence. 1556 Railroad
avenue, Alameda, where he had been
placed by the defendant three days
previously.
In response to the court's inquiry as
to why he had absented himself from
court Mr. Cohen said he was feeling
rather sick when he met Gutter, who
prevailed upon him to recuperate at his
(Gutter's) . home, but giving no hint
that his presence was demanded at the
trial.
After remarking that the circum
stance seemed rather suspicious, the
Judge placed Mr. Cohen under a 5250
bond io appear next Tuesday, when
the examination of Gutter will be re
sumed. .'.- - . _ .
Emanurl Augusta was of proportion
ate l>odily girth when a patrolman first
saw him at California street and Cen
tral avenue, but a minute, later he
presented an embonpoint that startled
the officer until he investigated and
found that the transformation- had
been effected by Emanuel thrusting
under his coat about a dozen, -wild
ducks, which he was peddling without
n licenre. Judge Mogan will sentence
him to-day.
Judge Fritz added $8200 to the munic
ipal treasury by forfeiting the bail of
eighty-two Chinese who were charged
with : gambling at Washington
street. Superior Judge Kerrigan â . had
issued an order restraining Judge Frits
from proceeding with the examination,
and on tho strength of it the defend
nnts did not appear when the magis
trate. Ignoring thÂ» Injunction, : called
the cases. The ball money was deposit
ed by Chin Kin You, -proprietor of the
gaming house In which the defendants
were arrested, and. his attorney's next
movt is awaited with, interest.
. By mastering the art of sleep-walk

have averted the necessity" of leaving
his native New Jersey. town. and com

eyes open and his feet in motion; but
so quiet was his beat and sojonely his
vigil that drowsiness o'ercame him de
spit** his- preventive endeavors, and
when he inadvertently leaned against
a tree he dropped into slumber, from
v.-hich he '.vas awakened by ; a vigilant
sergeant, who had deprived him of star
and club. His dismissal from the force
speedily followed. '- â  ' ..
Judge Conlan hoped that Mr. Oris
wold did not come to San Francisco
with intention of joining. the constabu
lary. "Bocaus*?,"- his- Honor added,
"somnambulism is just as valuable a
police asset here as in New Jersey."
Mr. Griswold said he had no such
intention, but was seeking any. kind of
an old job when he was arrested and
charged w^th vagrancy. The- charge
v:pjs dismissed.
For stealing a blanket from a stable
owned by his former -employer, P. C.
Baker of 273 Tehama street, "Pete"'
Massie was arrested anO booked for
petty larceny, and then the police dis
covered that he had obtained $60 from
a man by falsely representing that the
cash was to be exj>ended in the pur
chase of a horse. The effort to^-on
vict him of obtaining money by false
pretense was futile, but" the petty lar
ceny charge stuck and Judge Cabaniss
gave him five months.
Harry Puryea, who arrived here two
weeks ago from Richmond, Va., spat
upon a Market-street sidewalk and was
promptly arrested for it.
"I can assuah the hon'ble co't," said
Mr. Puryea to Judge Conlan, "that no
offense was intendedâ no, isuh, no of
fvnse was intended. In my town of
Richmond, suh, a gentleman is peh
mitted to spit when and wheahuhe im
pulse seizes him, suh."
The "gentleman" was dismissed,
and Robert W. Kellen, also accused of
having deposited a salivary offering
upon the same footpath, faced the
bcnchl In the town of Ukiah, Cal.,
â where he has lived for years, Mr.
Kellen pleaded, there is no lav.* pro
hibitive of free and copious expectora
tion on the public thoroughfares, and
he had never heard any one complain
that the lack of such an ordinance
created a long felt want. Besides, the
Ukiah sidewalks were of m&cadam.
He. too, was told to go and offend no
more.
"Sacre! , Not guil-tay!" exclaimed
Paul Roeback, with hair pompadour
and mustache spiked, when Juxige Mo
gan asked him if he was guilty of
vagrancy. . \
"I'll acknowledge that you do not
look the alleged character," said his
Honor, surveying the defendant's stal
wart and neatly clad figure.
"Ze charactaire?" was the response,
aided by a mighty shoulder heave.
"Xo, sare; I am ze gentleman."
"Mon Dieu!" shouted a stout com
patriot, who was awaiting opportunity
to testify for the defense. "He's not

"My dear friend," Paul exclaimed,

Mr. Roeback was arrested on the
first block of Geary street, near a sa
loon managed by . the. gentleman who
vouched for his character. The police
man was positive that he" had seen
the defendant many times during the
last month or two loitering In that

F I V E THOUSAND
FOR MRS. HALL
Damages Awarded Mother
and Seven Children for
Loss of Husband and Father
McCUE IS COMPENSATED
Fifteen Hundred Dollars Is
Given to Him for Severe
Injuries in a Collision
United States District Judge de Ha
ven handed down decisions In the cases
of Catherine Hall and her minor chil
dren against the Xorth Pacific, Coast
Railroad Company for damages
and in a suit against the same
party by James S. McCue [ for
damages caused by a collision between
the steamers San Rafael and Sausalito
on November 30, 1901. McCue Is award
ed $1500 and costs in his action against
the Sausalito.' Mrs. Hall and her seven
children receive $5000 for the loss of
Alexander Hall, her husband, in the
same accident. In the suit against the
sunken vessel San Rafael Mrs. Hall
receives $354.
The defendant denied that Hall was
a passenger "on the steamer San Ra
fael, as his body was never found and
no one who knew him saw him on
beard. , He was a resident of Sacra
jnento, and reached San Francisco in
time for him to have taken passage on
the San Rafael on her fatal trip. He
has never since been heard of. He had
left San Francisco with the avowed
purpose of going to San Rafael to visit
h!s brother-In-iaw, and as the missing
man was a kind and loving father and
of steady habits the court holds that
these facts are sufficient to justify the
conclusion that he was a passenger on
the San Rafael and was drowned. On
this point Judge de Haven says:
"There is nothing in the evidence to
suggest any other cause for his con
tinued absence from his home and fam
ily."
The court takes the view also that
there was negligence on the par-t of
the employes of the defendant on both
steamers, and pays:
"My conclusion is that the collision
was caused by the mutual fault of the
steamers in attempting to cross courses
in a dense fog. when neither could see
the other in time to avoid a collision."
In the McCue case the court says
"The llt>elant was about 72 years of
age at the date of the collision, and the
injuries received by him were pain
ful, one arm having been broken and
a portion of one ear cut off. The in
juries received are not such as seri
ously to interfere with the libelantin
carrying on his business. The evi
dence also shows that the Hbelant lost
property on his person of the value of
$400 or thereabouts." - â¢ ,â¢

Wagstaff as a "stall."

far to incriminate Wagstaff and L. C.
Robertson, under arrest with the
three women, but they will be held
pending developments. About 51000
worth of goods have been recovered
already. A quantity was recovered
from 401 Post street, where Mrs.

TAKES A TRIP

In "Wee Sma ? Hours" Com
missioner Huttoii Again
Views. Corruption District
GBAFTERS ABE WARNED
Patrolman Higgins Asserts
No One Can Show He Took
Coin From Fallen Women
Commissioner Hutton is still engaged
in gathering evidence for his heralded
expose of the enormous police graft in
the tenderloin. During tho whole of
Thursday night he slept not, but wan
dered tirelessly to arid fro in the high
ways and byways of Chinatown and
the Barbary Coast. What crimes and
what corruption were discovered by
the lynx-eyed official are locked safely
within his brain, for not one firecracker
may snap before the grand explosion
that shall come when Hutton lays bare
the rottenness of the red light district
police detail. 5 7 ;
After Tuesday, night's discoveries of
corruption in Bacon plave the Commis
sioner took a two days' rest. Thursday
night . he was abroad again. Pacific
street heard of his approach while he
was yet four blocks away. The music
in the saloons stopped promptly at 1
o'clock, the dance hall favorites went
early to bed and visiting males, from
the rural districts were allowed to re
move their change from the bars. Chi
natown was as quiet as Oakland. Hut
ton saw Fish alley, Bartlett alley, Sul
livan alley. Hinckley alley and Broad
way completely buried in peaceful re
pose. Tn the language of the patrol
men on duty in that part of town,
"there v was nothing doing." At 7:50
o'clock yesterday morning the Police
Commissioner had concluded his inves
tigations and stood sleepily waiting for
a car at the corner of Kearny and Pa
cific streets. Yesterday afternoon he
attended the meeting of the Police
Commission to investigate the gam
bling graft In Chinatown.
MAUSTAINS SIIiEXCE.
Commissioner Howell secured
a copy of The Call, and. indicating this
paper's exclusive account of the his
toric affair, in Bacon place, said: "You
are getting to be a ragular Sherlock
Holmes, Mr. Hutton." The "special
Chief of Police for 1129 Dupont street"
remained mute as the storied sphynx
that guards an Egyptian necropolis.
His associates on the board are â  not
honored with his confidences when the
private detective work is Involved.
Diinkhouse offered a resolution
recting Chief Wittman to arrest the
consorts - of fallen women. Howell ob
jected on the ground that it had not
been shown that the Chief had been
negligent .in this respect. It was ex
plained that the resolution was in no
way a reflection on the work of Witt
man, and it was adopted in the follow
ing terms:
"That the Chief of Police be directed
to use all efforts in the arrest and con
viction of all men (also known as
macquiereaux) who live and get rich
off the earnings of women whose oc
cupation is prostitution."
The Police Department is highly in
terested in the investigations being
conducted by Hutton. Its members
are anxious that he produce what evi
dence he has. He has become a famil
iar figure in the tenderloin, and unless
he disguises himself with green whis
kers and a- drees or something similar
he will hardly have. the opportunity to
learn much of the graft that has ex
isted until the last three days.
HIGGIXS KEEPS QUIET.
Police Officer Higgins, who is under
suspicion of having taken money from
the dissolute inmates of Bacon place,
maintains a discreet silence when Hut
ton's name Is mentioned. He continues
to deny that he ever received a dollar
from any of the' women and defies the
Police Commissioner to prove that he
did. Hutton failed to get the money
from the suspected patrolman's
pocket, thus materially weakening
what is alleged to be a clear case of
bribery. WIttman worked practically
the .same erame on Ernest Alexander,
but compelled his man to 'surrender the
marked coin.
When Hutton asked Higgins to
empty his pockets the patrolman re
plied:
. "What money I have in my pockets
1r my own and I will \ not give it up
to you. You can't get anything out
of me."l : - c -V â
It appears that Dean, who, so ably
assisted the Police Commissioner in
gathering evidence of corruption* in
the red light district, deliberately vio
lated the orders of the Chief of Police.
Section 3 of rule 33 of Police Depart
ment regulations says: "Each and
â¢rvery member of the department shall
report in writing each and every fact
and circumstance and all information
of^which they may become possessed
In any manner whatever which might
reflect discredit on the Police Depart
ment or any member thereof." .
There was a highly interesting oc
currence In the Pine-street alley, yet
Dean never reported the affair to his
superior officers, as was his duty, but
took Hutton's advice to "keep mum."
DEVELOPMENTS PROMISED.
After yesterday's meeting of the Po
lice Commission Hutton said: "We are
not ready to move yet, but will take
the question up later, just when I
cannot state." . .
This was in response to a request for
Information regarding the results , of
his investigations. â¢â â 
There is no doubt that the police on
duty In Chinatown and the tenderloin
have been getting plenty of "easy
money." They have been doing it
'â¢since the water came up to Montgom
ery Atrect.", But the trouble is to
prove it. Wittman has caught and pun
ished several men for that'sort of work.
Huttont is : aware of the grafting,- as is
every one else. He has worked diligent
ly and has secured evidence that fallen
women; pay a stipulated amount to pa
trolmen for "protection." He has a
partial case against ; Officer Higgins.
Now. the police and the public are wait
ing for him to substantiate his claims
of corruption.
.'Crooked policemen are so well school
ed in crookedness* that'ft is almost im
possible to catch them red handed. If
Hutton' can prove the corruption that
undoubtedly exists he* will score a hit
â¢with ; the public. Those who pay
tribute i for ''protection" seldom testify
against the men they bribe. The bribers
get adequate returns for all money
paid :, to policemen in being allowed to
disobey \ the laws, and . therefore I have
no motives for telling what 'they know
in the- course of formal investigations.
It is expected 'that; in the grand de
nouement prepared by Hutton the fact
will appear that since Wittman has
been Chief footpads, "strong-arm" men
and bunko artists have been much less
active on the ; Barbary, Coast than ever
before in the history of the city, even

HOME FOR OLD SOLDIERS
MAY GO TO GOVERNMENT
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 16. â Governor
Pardee' to-day" received a letter , from
the chairman of the board of directors
of the Soldiers' Home at Yountville,
Xapa County, notifying him that the
board had passed a resolution in favor
of the passage of a bill. by the Legis
lature " transferring: the Yountville
heme to the United States Govern
ment, if the Government will accept it.
The home is a beautiful place, but
a doubt is expressed \ as to whether
the Government will want to maintain
two homes for soldiers in one State.
It already has a fine home for. soldiers
at Santa Monica.
The directors of the Yountville home
say that if it is concluded that the
State will continue to maintain the
place an appropriation of $65,000 in
stead of $55,000 will be asked for at
the coming session of the Legislature.
The directors also want the Legisla
ture to pass a law prohibiting the sale
of liquor within one mile and a half
of the home. . V \.

electricity from the Standard Electric
Company's wires. ThÂ«? accident hap
pened at the foot of Tenth avenue in
East Oakland, where tha pile-driver
was being used In the construction of
a bulkhead.
The crew of the pile-driver were set
tiny piles near the shore of the Oak
land estuary, directly under the main
line of the Standard Electric Company,
which at this point passes clo-re to the
shore, the work being done under th*
direction of Foreman James McClure.
The hoiet rope had bÂ»en detached from
the hammer and was being used to
hoist a pile from the water, prepara
tory to placing it between the guides
of the pile-driver. As the pile was
drawn from the water it swung out
from the derrick, whereupon the hoist
rope, a heavy manila hawser, was
brought in contact with the heavily
charged wires.
Instantly there was a flash, and the
heavy rope, being soaked with salt
water, which m:Â»de it an excellent con
ductor, transmitted the deadly current
to the drum of the winch, and through
that to the other machinery. McCaw
â¢was standing with his hand on the
starting lever of the hoisting winch
and he received the full strength of
the current through his body. With
out a struggle he pitched headlong to
the deck. dead.
Isaac Wilson, the foreman of the
dredger crew, was standing near the
hoisting engine when the rope struck
the wire and received a shock heavy
enongh to knock him senseless to the
deck. Half an hour's hard work was
required to resuscitate him and he was
later removed to hi? home in San Fran
ci*co. James Eubanks, the. fireman of
the pile-driver, was in the engine
room. He received enough of the cur
rent to throw him from his feet.
McCaw must have received the full
force of tho current through the handle
of the Etartinsr lever, for had any other
portion of his body come in
with the heavily charged machinery
the flesh would have been burned

THE SAN .FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY; ,â¢ -DECEMBER 17, 1904.
SAYS EVIDENCE
INSUFFICIENT
Judge Mortimer Smith De
nies Application for Arrest
of Burglarious Policemen
BARS THE CONFESSION
Special Patrolman Jacobson
Under Charges of Falsely
Accusing a Brother Officer
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 16.
Upon the ground t'hat the evidence
was insufficient Police Judge Mortimer
Smith to-day, denied the application of
Prosecuting. Attorney A. P. â¢ Leach for
complaints charging burglary in the
cases of former Sergeant of Police C:
E. Giark. Lee E. Andrews, J. F. Stahl
and C. W. Hamerton. *
His Honor was compelled to rule out
the confessions of the men on the testi
mony of Chief of Police Hodgkins. The
Chief said the statements were ob
tained by threatening the quartet that
they would be sent to Jail unless they
told all they knew. The four were also
promised that whatever they said
should not be used against them in
criminal proceedings.
Neither Patrolman Shannon nor
Special Policeman Goodwin could testi
fy to sufficient knowledge of the cases
to warrant issuance of complaints. H.
D. Cushing, , E. J. Buswell Jr. and
James Cahill, merchants from whose
chops articles were taken, all testified'
they had missed nothing and knew
nothing about the affair. - ;
The inquiry only developed the cer
tain fact that Chief Hodgkins made no
attempt to get evidence that might be
used in a criminal proceeding. -He con
fined himself entirely to jamming
enough out. of the men themselves to
warrant him in getting them out of
the department.
1 Hamerton and Andrews appeared In
court. Stahl and Clark were, absent.
Attorney A.- V. Mendenhall appeared
for Clark and Andrews. , ..
The next step In' the interminable
scandal will be taken by the Grand
Jury, which has been instructed to
make an investigation. - â .
Charges were filed with the Police
Commissioners to-day by Chief Hodg
kins against Special . Policeman A. T.
Jacobson, alleging that Jacobson had
made false statements against Patrol
man H.' B.' Henderson that were detri-.
mental to Henderson's character and
prejudicial to the Police Department.
The charges are based on public accu
sations said to have been made by r .Ja
cobson in averring he had; seen Hen
derson "take property from East-Oak
land residences.
The Police Commissioners directed
Chief Hodgkins to submit a report in
wilting upon the charges said to have
been made by Jacobson. \ He was also
notified 40 .order, Jacobson to file writ
ten charges against- Henderson or to
appear next Friday before the 'board.
â¢ Police officials do not credit: Jacob
son's charges. .. Chief Hodgkins .an
nounced that Jacobson must either.sus
tain his accusations or face the Police
Board. r; â¢
Attorneys A. V. Mendenhall .' and
Thomas J. Thompson, on behalf of
Clark, Andrews, Hamerton and j Stahl,
made demand to-day for the Issuance
of the salary warrants that the board
has held up. The demand was not ac
ceded to, and the attorneys said they
would mandamus the board.
The charges against Patrolman J. F.
Sill made by Policeman M. Shannon
were dismissed, the evidence failing to
connect Sill with the taking of hams
from Becker's market, as alleged.
The trial of Policeman P. McKeegan
on a charge of unlawful arrest was set
for December 27. . . - . '

REASON'S FOR FLUCTUATION . *V

: Out-Causes of Decrease in Rev

BERKELEY, Dec. 16. â The income
of the University of California fluc
tuates greatly, according to . Acting
Secretary^ Victor Henderson of the
board of regents. ' Henderson declares
that the -fluctuation' "referred! to. is
caused by ''â  the differences in assessed
valuations throughout the State.-, The
university" gets :ihe! benefit of a 2-cent
tax. and., the ; income from "this "source
can be reduced when assessments
fluctuate. â¢ According to> Henderson's
statement there has been in -the last
two years' a â 'difference, 'of .as much as
$35,000 In the. amounts annually re
ceived by the university.- Henderson
says: - â¢ 'â¢V?^-; r - ; j'^ '.-'j".*- r
Some S300.000 a of the university's
revenues or about half its annual Income for
the support ot the university s activities at

-trf the wealth of- the State, - the university s
Income trom tfeto Â«>urce .will. Â«xÂ»nd. though
the tendency ot the assessed valuation to be

actual values makes the growth of Income
from the 2 cent tax extremely Irregular.
For innance. the university win this year
receive about Slft.COO - lens,- from the 2 cent

more than SDO.tttft in excess of the tax yield

"IF PERSON' IS A 1.EPER
Afflicted Woman in Honolulu Appeals
From tbe Decision ot the Board
of Health.
HONOLULU. Dec. 10. â Local
health officlals.are much annoyed over
the action^ taken to prevent the send
ing of a woman named Kalpu to.Mol
okai as a leper. - They say it is a
clear case of leprosy and that the.,in
terference of the Federal authorities
will only tend to make the lepers at
Molokai discontented. Judge Dole
says the grossest form of injustice
might be worked if people could be
sent to the leper settlement without
the chance of a hearing or without
thorough examination by their own
physicians. -.
The Board of Health has adopted
its own rules for ascertaining whether
leprosy exists in, suspected cases and
careful examinations are made by
many .physicians .before deportation Is
ordered^ â¢ Recently. Ihe" rules , were ex
tended to provide for .longer exam
inations and requiring the .unanimous
verdict of the examining physicians.
It is said that the legal question of
the powers of. the. Board of 'Health to
provide rules f or ; such matters has
never been settled and the present
case may make it necessary for the
Legislature to adopt definite laws.

completely tiled the pocket into which
Ebe had been skillfully steered.

PUT NO LIMIT

Baseball " Managers Are at
Liberty, to Pay Players
\\3iatever They See Fit
LONG SEASON PLANNED
Seattle Opens Here, Port
land at Los Angeles
and Tacoma at Oakland
i The magnates . of the Pacific Coast
Baseball League continued their ses
sion yesterday afternoon and evening:.
After taking up a number: of import
ant ' ; details they adjourned till 8
o'clock on Monday evening." One of
the principal points decided was the
salary limit. After a lengthy discus
sion It was agreed that no limit be
placed on the amount of money to be
paid players and that each manager
use his own judgment in this respect.
The season, will open on Thursday,
March 30 and close on Sunday, Decem
be*r%3.' San Francisco meets Seattle
in fhis city, Los /Cngeles will enter
tain Portland and Oakland is to hook
up with Tacoma on the Oakland
grounds. From present indications, it
looks 'as thougrh there will be almost
continuous ball on the diamond across
the bay, though this question has not
been definitely decided 3'et.
A' schedule committee composed of
Messrs. Harris, Ewing, Morlev, Mc-
Creedie, Evans and Agnew was ap
pointed. The committee will start to
work on the schedule immediately and
the matter will probably be fixed up in
a few days. Six schedules are to be
submitted and the most likely looking
.one will be accepted. President Bert
was instructed to purchase a suitable
pennant to be presented to the'Taco
ma team. It was also decided to di
vide the holiday receipts in each city
equally among the six clubs of the
league.
Morley -â¢ was absent at the evening
session; but the remainder qt the mag
nates got together and talked business.
The confab was devoted mostly to the
private affairs of the league and little
business of Interest to the public was
done. It was agreed, that passes be
issued only to the press and the wives
of players. President Bert was in
structed to have a book of rules with
instructions to players and umpires
printed and properly distributed.
The magnates also voted unanimous
ly in favor of sending President : Bert
to the national convention of minor
leagues which will open at Cincinnati
on February 2.

THE FRENCH INCOME TAX.
IX this country reform in taxation is under discussion in many
States besides California. In Ohio it is advancing to the front
as the leading political issue, and it should come to the front
here. When it does it should include such an obvious necessity as
the exemption from local taxation of American shipping, if Califor
nia wish San Francisco to become a leading ship owning seaport,
and ship building to be a flourishing local industry.
Tax reform is in the air in many countries. It is coming to
be understood by politicians, as it has long been understood by
economists, that the taxing power, which is the power to legally
confiscate propejty for the use of government, is the most impor
tant of public functions* The power to tax is the power to op
press. It appears in its most oppressive form in Italy, and there,
too, this reform is a burning issue. In France the life of the
Combes Ministry depends upon this issue, for France, so advanced
in many things, is far behind other countries in methods of taxa
tion. She still levies a tax on windows and outside doors, and the
result is a depressing style of rural architecture, devised to require
as few windows and doors as possible, thus depriving the people
of the physical blessing and benefit of light and air.
It is an unjust and unsanitary tax. It has a relation to the
health and strength and morals of the people, and is in a high de
gree oppressive and unjust, but the financial emergencies of the
republic, the large exemptions of productive religious establish
ments and other peculiarities have seemed to make its maintenance
necessary. Xow Premier Combes has determined to abolish this tax
on light, air and the health and comfort of the people, along with
other primitive and wasteful forms of taxation, and to substitute for
them an income tax. It is proposed to exempt incomes of $500 and
less, and to increase the rate* on incomes above that exempt mini
mum until it reaches 2 per cent on incomes of $4000 and over.
The measure has the support of President Loubet, which im
plies that it will have the support of the bourgeoisie, the middle
class, to which he belongs. If this be so it should carry, for the
middle class are the actual rulers of France. In no other country
is that class as well organized and as powerful. Â» Instead of being
dictated to by capital on one side and organized labor on the
other, it dictates to both, and even in combination they are unable to
escape its mastery.
This income tax applies to .foreigners domiciled in France for
business purposes, and oddly enough this is the ground upon
which the Nationalists and Conservatives in the Chamber oppose
it. If an income tax is to be adopted, it surely should apply equally
to all who enjoy the protection of the law for their property and
business- In this country all taxation is of such general applica
tion, and an American statesman would not dare propose that dom
iciled foreigners should be exempted from taxes which citizens pay.
The French proposition separates rentafs from other incomes,
and is expected to raise a revenue of $26,006,000 from incomes and
$12,000,000 from rentals of real estate. To an outsider it appears
that the chief merit of the measure is that it takes the place of
such unjust taxation as that on doors and windows, and other un
scientific and unsatisfactory levies. All of the enemies of the
Combes Ministry are rallying against it and hope to defeat it. The
socialists join in the attack on the Ministry, for the sake of doim*
anything to destroy existing government by hampering reforms
which if effected would increase the firmness of its seat. If the
Ministry be defeated an appeal to the people will follow, the result
of which will be of the greatest interest far outside of France. The
discussion of the measure is to have precedence over everything
else in the present -session, and as. in the Chamber there are econo
mists of repute and fiscal experts of high standing, it may. be ex
pected that the debate will make valuable additions to the literature
of the subject, which may be beneficially studied in this country,
where the same general issue is coming to the front.
It is interesting that the two foremost republics of the world
are at the same time occupied witth the same general subject. While
in our American States we have no taxation as unscientific and un
just as the French door and window tax, it is true that we have
taxation that fails of its object, that separates the burdens from
the benefits of government and distributes them unequally. It is
a wholesome sign of advancing intelligence that this is considered
the leading issue under free government, whose purpose is equality.
THE SUNDAY CALL'S CHRISTMAS EDITION.
TWENTY-FOUR pages of the brightest and' most spirited
Christmas fie !<<n features that could be procured East or West
v \vill to-morrow make the annual Christmas edition -of the
Sunday Call the most notable Christmas edition of a daily 'paper
that has ever appeared in San Francisco. The work of California
writers of fiction has been given precedence. "The Madonna of the
Tules" is the prize story for the week, written by Martha Tustiu
Patton of San Francisco. Incorporated within this story is a de
scription of the tule lands that would be no discredit to the pen
of any of tlfe literary artists of the day. \
"The Masque of Joy/' by Charles Tenney Jackson of Oakland,
is also by a new California writer. It is a story filled with plenty
of heart interest, artistically relieved by a., fine thread of humor. It
deals with an eventful Christmas eve at a Folsom street boarding
house. A. D. McMillan of Nevada City contributes a simon pure hu
morous yarn, "Doc Wilson's Christmas Pudding," which will be thor
oughly enjoyed by all who love a good early time California story.
"The Hold-up at Mirabel" is a clever story from the pen of Madqe
Morris, whose California stories are well known. Katheryn Jar
boe, another California writer whose work is winning recognition
in wider fields, contributes a story of the Southern California oil
fields in "The Oil on Blodgett's Farm."
From Eastern writers whose work is familiar there are several
splendid stories. "Henny: A Christmas Story," is a touching re
cital of child life by Amelie Rives; Fergus Hume iias "A Christ
mas Tree": John Strange Winter contributes "Three Inches
of Snow"; and Mrs. Burton Harrison, "The Last Christmas
of the Confederacy." All the regular features appeaj: "On and
Off the Bread Wagon.\' by Charles Dryden :' "Jottings of Old Lim
Jucklin," by Opie Read; "Double Harness," by Anthony Hope;
the book page by Robert W. Ritchie: Madge Moore's page; a page
on first aid to gas victims, and the regular, puzzle page.
There are several handsome full page drawings, notably one
by R. W. Borough. "The Typical California Girl," and one by John
F. Woolrich, "The Old-Time. Christmas Dinner."
THE PRESS OF THE NATION^
The United States mail* carry in a year 8,500,000,000 pieces of matter at
& cost of 1 150,000.001. and if the rural delivery service, which row. serves
one-seventh of our people at an expense of $22,000,000, were eliminated the
postofflce would be self-supporting. The postofflce was not established to
make money, but even without any retrenchment it would make money, prob
ably, if the cheap parcel post were introduced here as it exists In other pro
gressive countries. â Boston Transcript.
The places under the customs service which the President .has Just in
cluded in the classified service are precisely of the sort 'to which the appli
cation or extension of the merit system ought to produce good results. Noth
ing can improve the service more than the offer of some prospect of advance
ment to subordinates who are faithful and efficient.- â New York Evening
Port.
This nation owes a great debt to lawyers. But where Jefferson, Hamil

NEW ORLEANS WOMAN ACTS
AS A "SOCIAL ADJUSTER"
MRS. EURYDICE ALLEYX.
* * nearly, all the professions, new and old, are overcrowded,
111 there is one that is not. Only one person., as far as is known, has
VJL/ embraced it. That person is Mrs. Eurydice Alleyn of New Or
leans, who calls herself a "social 1 adjuster," *6r arbiter, says the
Chicago Inter Ocean. Mrs. Alleyn is returning home by way of Chicago
from a visit of several months in Canada and New York. â¢ v *
"There are many people nowadays, you know, who are trying to
break Into societyâ 'nouveau riche' we call them' down in New Orleans,"
said Mrs. Alleyn during her stay in this city. "There are people, too,
already in, who want to keep the new ones out.' -It is my business to be
a living list of guests, a sort of animated epitome of who's who and who
isn't, so as to help them both. Many women who can. afford to keep a
social secretary prefer not to, and, in New Orleans especially, where the
peculiar social conditions admit poverty to the highest strata, provided
it is blue-blooded, there are many who would but cannot afford to. I am
consulted by both and provide lists of guests who will be congenial,
whether it is the woman who's trying to break In' or she who Is resist
ing the bourgeois invasion, and who, is to be the hostesi at the function.
And that is something every hostess cannot do for herself in these days
when it -is a hard matter to tell who has 'arrive/1' and therefore a danger
ous thing to snub without knowing exactly whom one is snubbing." ââ
In addition to adjusting the status of social aspirations, Mrs. Alleyn
also designs social functions â "nothing monkeyish. Just- unique," she says.

WAR CORRESPONDENT
OF THE FUTURE.
In devising a Eystem of war corre
spondence it is necessary to keep in
mind two essentials â first, the right of
the public to know how a* war Is con
ducted, and, second,* the right of the
military authorities to "conceal certain
preparations, movements and at times
even results, says Frederick W. Unger
In the December Booklovers' Magazine.
To reconcile these apparently conflict
ing necessities may be difficult, but it
Is essential to try to do so. The first
step Is to provide for: the registration
of correspondents. / In â  times of peace
the War Department should receive ap
plications for correspondents* licenses,
and after fully satisfying themselves
regarding the applicants* qualifications
the examining officials should place the
names of those found worthy upon an
approved list. When occasion arises
correspondents can then be selected
from a body of men of proved ability
and assured character.
The men thus chosen should be given
the full privileges of the fro'nt and al
lowed to write as 'they choose. Their
material should be sealed and commit
ted to 'the military authorities, to be
dispatched when these officials â  see fit.
The matter could thus be helÂ« until the
official in charge was satisfied that no
harm could come to campaign opera
tions from, publication, but when pub
lished the letters should be given to the
world precisely as the correspondents
wrote them. After all, It is not im
portant that the public should know
Immediately of every movement in the
field, but it is of the highest import
ance that the military authorities
should always act with the knowledge
that^all the essential facts of their
operations will reach the public sooner
or later. Civilization needs a witnessâ
an unprejudiced witnessâ at the very
front in warfare to guard against the
grave dangers of ; a militarism which
feels itself exempt from criticism. ;

To see what horses should be played.

He studied thoughtfully a table
Which showed the records of each stable.
And figured out a line of .dope
Which made a certainty of hope.
There was no question" of the third;
Breakdown would win: it was absurd
For all the rest to try to start;
He knew it from hjs little chart.
The fourth was Just as big a cinch;
He had it figured to an inch.
Likewise the fifth, also the last;
The winners were as good as past. â¢
Now he can drive the bookies wild.
Like grabbing gumdrops from a child
'Twill be when .he invades the ring
And lays a bet on each sure thing.
But when out to the track he went.

MEXICAN WARâ Vallambrosa, Cal.
The war of the United States with
Mexico commenced April 24. 1S46, and
terminated July 4, 1848. The United
States troops engaged numbered 30,934
regulars and 73,776 volunteers, making
a total of 112,230. The estimated cost
of the war to the United States was
about $100,000,000.
DISPLACEMENTâ S. J., Oakland,
Cal. Displacement as applied to war
ships is the quantity of water displaced
by the vessel. The weight of the dis
placed water equals that of the vessel.
A vessel having a displacement of 8000
tons has a tonnage capacity which is
much less. While a warship's capacity
is less than its displacement, it is tha
other way with passenger vessels.
STIRRUP CUPâ Enq, City. The old

of. giving a rider a parting drink after
he had mounted and had his feet in
the stirrups. In the north of Eng
land it was called "the cup at the
door." The custom of the stirrup-cup
is thus referred to by Sir Walter Scott
in "Marmion":

Those who believe that mentality plays
some Dart In disease' and its cure generally

mental suggestion, hypnotism, will power,
mental science, which Is spurious and not re
lated to Christian Science, or tÂ» some other
erroneous or material belief.- Christian

Peytons Say Powder 3Ionop
oly'Is Scheming to Ruin
What It Cannot Control
AFFIDAVITS ,rABE BEAD
Chemical Concern Declares
Its Destructiorf Is Sought
y as a Dangerous Competitor
That the powder trust la scheming to
crush a competitor that' it cannot con
trol Is the startling cause assigned by
the Peyton Chemical for the
litigation in which it has been involved
by the E. L du Pont de Nemours Pow
der Company of New Jersey.
trust Is the owner of MOO shares
of the chemical company's stock. This
has been advertised for sale for the
payment of a delinquent assessment of
130,000. The sale was to have taken
place last Saturday, but the New Jer
sey corporation grot a temporary in
junction from Judge Kerrigan, and yes
terday was set for the Peyton company
to show cause why' the 'injunction
should not be made permanent. The
hearing was not finished. It will go on
this morning:, the Peytons urging a
hasty determination because of a debt
of $113,906 25, which must be paid on
December SI. This debt is one of thÂ«
bases of the charge of conspiracy to
wreck the local concern. It Is owed to
the Du Fonts for money loaned, and It
cannot be paid unless the Du Pont com.
pany pays its assessment on the Pey
ton shares or permits them to be sold.
If the assessment is paid the Peyton
company promises to pay the notes; if
it is not, the chemical company Bays
it will lose $293,000 In collateral, includ
ing W. C. Peyton's 1500 shares of stock,
which will give the trust its sought-f or
control. . w
These facts and many others bearing
upon the merits of the case and the
chargpes of Intent to ruin the chemical
company are set forth in the volumin
ous affidavits of the officers and direct
ors of the concern, including those of
President W. C Peyton and Secretary
J. P. Wallace, read in court yesterday.
Peyton says that he is the owner of
stock worth $257,900, upon which he has
paid the assessment of $10 a share.
TO PREVENT PAYMENT.
He declares that the suit was brought
by the Du Pont company for the pur
pose of preventing the plaintiff from
paying its debts on December 31 in tho
hope that it can thereby obtain col
lateral of the value of $293,000 and ac
quire control of the defendant corpora
tion, wreck It and thereby avoid pom
petition which would confront the trust
If the chemical company remains In
business. Peyton says he has devoted
his money and energies to his company
until it has become the largest manu
facturer of strong adds in the United
States.
He says that on November 18 a suit
was commenced in the United States
Circuit Court - and dismissed, and the
present action in the Superior Court
was -begun the day before the sale.
This, he says, Is a part of the con
spiracy to wreck the company. He says
that the Du Pont company controls the
powder business of the United States,
and a large part of its promts Is de
rived from the sale of smokeless pow
der'to the Government. The Peyton
company, he j says. Is In a position to
enter into the smokeless powder busi
ness and reduce the income of the trust.
The affiant declares that T. C. du
Pont, president, and Pierre S. du Pont,
treasurer of the Du Pont company, re
sorted to various means to acquire con
trol of the Peyton company. They made
him a proposition, which he refused,
and then, he says, he was told that the
greater company and Its subsidiary
corporations would wreck the chemical
company. He says that they acknowl
edged that they procured the California
Powder Works to repudiate a contract
for chemicals, to the damage of the
Peyton company In the sum of $570,000.
The trust owns about half the stock in
the California Powder Company. He
says, too, that they have resorted to
vexatious litigation, the creation of dis
satisfaction among customers, scurril
ous accusations and caused an attach
ment suit to be filed on a $30,000 claim
for which no demand had been made. *'
AID FOR AX ENEMY.
Then, it is said, they attempted to
gain access to the company's (books for
R. S. Pennlmaii, vice president of the
California Powder Company, an avowed
enemy and business rival of the Peyton
company. >
/Secretary Wallace's affidavit went
Into more details in regard to the neces-
Eity of the assessment, the financial
transactions and the repudiation of the
numberless charges against the com
pany made in the case In the Circuit
Court. Among other things he said
that it was charged that the oempany's
plant was not worth $300,000, when it
was worth more than $500,000 and all of
its assets amount to $1,000,000. He
quotedfrom letters from the three Du
Ponts, one ' ratifying the present man
agement and the others congratulating
Peyton on his success.

Fire Commissioners Find
That All Bids Must-Be
Beturned to the Firms
Whether or not' Chief Sullivan of
the Fire Department will sbon ride
in an automobile or whether he. will
have to continue , to drive' behind a
trusty department, steed is a problem.
The outlook is that several weeks,
perhaps months, -will pass before the
Commissioners provide the answer,
and in the meantime the board is
troubled. \'- ; â¢.â¢"-.â¢-'
When the bids for furnishing one
or more automobiles for. the use of
Chief Sullivan and his assistants were
about to be opened at yesterday's reg
ular meeting Secretary . McCarthy
raised a warning hand and -proceeded
to read a- protest from the Holle Au
tomobile Company of - this . city that
offered to show that* the specifications
drawn up by the" board and adver
tised, according to law permitted the
selling to the department, of only one
class of machine â that known . as the
autocar. In the specifications cer
tain,, technical terms are used that to
a layman are somewhat bewildering,
but the Holle company was there to
show that they accurately and in the
smallest detail described an autocar
and no other automobile manufac
tured could be offered in competition
whose general make-up is not on the
autocar order.
The Holle company's protest stated
that "thÂ« specifications are so framed
as to practically prevent any one from
bidding except the West Coast Motor
Company, agents for the car described
in the specifications. It can be seen
that only one bid can be received, and
the purpose of the charter is de
feated.",
PROTESTS PROM AGENTS. \
Attorney Charles Low, who repre
sents the Haynes-Apperson Automo
bile Company, was present in the in
terest of that concern to make the
same protest as that.framed by B. P.
Brinegar of the Holle company. There
was -a long discussion on the motion
of Commissioner Parry that all the
bids be rejected, as he desired to be
fair with all bidders. Mr. Parry also
argued 'that it was his desire and the
desire of Chief Sullivan that the test
of ejay machine offered the j city jj be
made by the department's" engineer
and superintendent of machinery-
Chief Sullivan said that he ' knew
nothing about automobiles and did
not care to be In any way responsible
for passing judgment on one. That
should be left to the officials men
tioned by Mr. Parry.
Mr. Brinegar suggested that it
would be well for the board to wait
awhile before purchasing machines,
lor the 1905 models will soon be re
ceived. Chairman J. George Boyne of
the board and Commissioner Wreden
agreed that it would be. well to post
pone action and readvertise for ten
ders. A motion to this effect was
carried. Commissioner Barrett was
not present to voteÂ»
- The department, it was told, is in
a peculiar position regarding auto-,
mobiles. In fact, they have to have
a "chug- wagon," as buggy horses are
scarce â so' scares that It is almost
impossible to buy the particular sort
of animals required. Chief Sullivan
and his men do not like the idea of
the horse famine and would rather
climb hills' in an auto than on shanks'
mare.; .;-. .-. -;c.
APPLICATION ALLOWED.
The application of Engineer Mitch
ell for back pay waa granted. Mitch
ell was injured by a fall from a roof
while on duty and he will â¢ get his
money and be reinstated by Chief Sul
livan as soon as. he can be placed. The
application of George Clancy ' of
Truck No. 2 for back pay was put
over for one week, but the Commis
sioners intimated that it would be al
lowed. Clancy while running to a fire
slipped, fell and fractured his elbow.
He was Incapacitated for duty for
twenty-seven days., . ' â  â¢â
M. H. Heeney of Engine 18 was
granted a .leave of absence for six
months. The application of Engineer
Thomas Conners for a transfer of po
sitions was referred to Chief Sullivan.
The communication of the Spring
Valley Water Company regarding the
laying of mains on McAllister street,
near Flllmore, was .referred . to Chief
Sullivan. The Commissioners will go
to Napa on the 22d of this month to
witness the engine tests to take place
there. The application of the Humane
Society for the use of an. unused ani
mal ambulance now at the depart
ment's corporation yard was put over

Bids for ten engine and .five buggy
horses were received. The ten engine

A bride of ten days, who has passed
her forty-fourth year, and her 28-year
old husband, : who was . a New York
volunteer. â  In the â - Philippines > and re
cently an expressman in this city, were
in Judge Coffey's court yesterday
morning at the hearing of an applica
tion by the woman's relatives for the
appointment of. a guardian. for her es
tate." When the petition for guardian
ship, was filed a few weeks ago by
George Golder he represented that he
was acting at, the request of the cou
sins of Margretta M. -Brady. It was
alleged that she had about ' $3000 In
bank and $2000 worth of â¢ realty and
the money had "been obtained and dis
sipated by "designing persons who were
seeking to get the remainder of the es
tate." â¢;-:â :-'Â« .
after, the application was
made Mrs. Bradr married Finnerty at
St. Domiuick's Church. It is now
charged by- the cousins, Joseph Dur
ney. and Emma Mahler, that Finnerty
has helped spend his wife's money and
is now offering her realty for sale. Mrs.
Finnerty, who looks older than her
confessed forty-four years, said she
was a native of California and that her
former husband , was dead. Judge Cof
fey decided to postpone further hear
ing for. a week and asked â  Finnerty if
he would run away frpm his wife be
fore the case- was tried. TTou couldn't

Supervisors Think Price Put
on Twin Peaks Land Is
r Too High and Beject Offer
PLAN FOB NEW LIBBABY
Committee Unable to Decide
on -Either of the Twa
Blocks UnderConsideration
The Supervisors' joint Finance, Fire
and Utilities Committee yesterday re
ceived an offer from the Market and
St^nyan Streets Land 'Company to sell
to the city forty-seven acres of land on
Twin Peaks as a reservoir sit* for an
auxiliary high-pressure water system
for increased fire f protection at 12000
per acre. The committee regarded
the price as too high and after reject-
Ing the offer directed the City Attor
ney to begin at once condemnation
proceedings under the law of eminent
domain for the acquisition of tho land
required for the reservoir site. "'
Before taking action the committee
asked O. D. Baldwin, president of the
company, If he could not get a lower
offer from his board of directors,
Baldwin raplied: "A less pric* cannot
be obtained and If condemnation pro
ceedings are brought they will be
fought to the bitter end."
The joint committee on Finance
and Utilities considered the selection
of a site for the new Public Library.
The call for the bond issue election
designated Western Addition block No.
67, bounded by Van Ness avenue,
Polk, Grove and, Fulton streets, as
the site, while the Public Library Trus
tees formally decided in favor of block
73, bounded by Van Ness avenue.
Franklin, Fell and Hayes, streets^
B. R. Taylor, a Library Trustee,
made a strong plea for. the selection
of block 73 as a site, declaring it pos
sessed excellent natural advantages.
He was followed by Trustees J. B.
O'Connor, who said the Trustees were
unanimous in favor of the block. J.
D. Phelan, on behalf of the San Fran
cisco Adornment Association, indorsed
the choice of the Library Trustees be
cause it would be in the civid center
of the city and would be advisable In
view of the possible extension of the
park panhandle to Market street at
some future date.
C. G. Hooker urged the purchase of
block 67, he representing some rela
tives who own a portion of the block.
Hooker produced a plan prepared by
O. H. Burnham. civic architect of the
Adornment Association, in' which' block
6C, bounded by McAllister, Fulton and
Polk streets and Van Ness avenue, was
fixed upon for the site. W. Magee
said block- 73 should be bought for
$586,000 and J. A. Jones said block
67 could be purchased for $647,000.
Supervisor Hocks' motion to select
block 73 was seconded by Connor, but
was withdrawn after the committee
decided to defer action for one week.

Occidental Eleven to Line
Up on Alameda Cricket
Ground Against Eagles
Three matches will be played to-mor
row fcr the championship. of the Cali
fornia Association Football League for
the season of 1904-1905, one at Idora
Park, Oakland, one at Freeman's Park, j
Golden Gate, and the third on the j
cricket ground, Alameda.
The Occidentals are matched against
the Eagles, the ball to be kicked off at
2:30 p. m. at Alameda, with C. W. Irish j
as referee. At 2:30 the Albion Rovers
â will meet the Vampires at Freeman's
Park, Hugh Williamson being the
referee. On the grounds at Idora Park,
Oakland, the Hornets will line up at i
2:30 p. m. against the Pickwicks, Nor
man Logan being the referee.
As the Hornets should win easily
from the Pickwicks and the Occiden-,
tals are pretty certain to prove supe
rior to the Eagles, the closest and most
Interesting game will be that between
the Albion Hovers and the Vampires.
Last Sunday the Oakland Hornets and
the Vampires provided the only tie .
match that has been played during the
present season. The Albion Rovers,
playing with only ten men after the
firÂ«t few minutes, scored 6 goals to 2
against the Pickwicks. The Occidental-
Kagle teams r.ill line up in the follow

There was some doubt whether Glar
ner would be able to take his place on
the halfback lino last Sunday for the
Vampires, as during the week previous
he had his left ribs in a plaster cast,
but he played the game, wearing a
fctrong bandage. He will certainly take
part in to-morrow's match. * The Vam

The Oakland Hornets, after a bad
start, have gathered a team that* con
tains some of the strongest individual
players in the league, and that will be
an important factor in the contest for
the championship. Their first victory
was won when they defeated the Occi
dentals, who had not lost a match, on
the 4th inst. at Idora Park. Last Sun
day the Vampires could not score
against them. The teams will occupy

GUNMEN ENJOY
GREAT SPORT
Find Ideal Weather Condi
tions on the Marshes and
Return With Big Strings
MANY HAVE THE LIMIT
Good Shooting Is Expected
Again This Week, as Ducks
Are Plentiful Everywhere
Ideal weather conditions for duck
shooting prevailed last Sunday, with
the result that the legions of sports
men on the marshes had the best day's
sport of the season. There .was a light
rain falling and a good wind -blowing,
which kept the birds on the move, and
they worked well for the guns. The
same conditions prevailed throughout
the district shot over by the sports
men from this .city, with the result
that all returned, heavily laden with
game. As the weather conditions re
main favorable the owners of preserves
expect to duplicate the strings of can
vasbacks, mallard, teal and sprig which
fell to their guns last week.
If the favorable weather continues
the gunmen anticipate great sport dur
ing the Christmas and New Year holi
days.
Up at the Miramonte Club, preserve
at Burdells, near Petaluma, limit bags
were the rule. Among the members in
the blinds were J. Homer Fritch, Mr.
Mac-Arthur and R. C. Rosenberg'.
The Alameda Gun Club men. includ
ing Harry Haight, Norton, Bolander
and others, all had the limit.
Down Alvarado way nearly every
man on the marsh had fifty ducks to
bring home.
Four members of the Multnomah
Club secured a Joint bag of 150 birds,
principally mallard, at their Collins
ville preserve. '
Joe Ross of Antioch killed fifty gad
well. This is a big, palatable gray
duck, which is not seen here in large
numbers.
J. Wilson Bannatyne shot at Giant
some days since and brought down
twenty "cans."
Otto Feudner and Edwin Forster shot
on a preserve near Suisun last Sunday.
The former secured fifty ducks, of
which thirty were "cans." Mr. Forster
was not so successful, his total being
seventeen. .
On Tomales Bar the "cans" seemed
the only birds moving. C. Schmidt and
a friend killed 100 of these, which were
the only ones that came their way.
E. Gamble killed the limit on Peta
luma Creek, his string consisting of
sprig and teal.
Clarence Xauman, Ed Drake. Billy

Wattle's and Charles Laing averaged
forty birds to the guri on the U. M. C.
preserve at Collinsville. Mr. Nauman
was also out on Wednesday with Mr.
Hull . of Seattle^ and > each had good
eport. Mr. Hull was stationed on the
best pond and had a great shoot". His
string was chiefly made up of "cans.v
C.^Hoffman killed forty-two bluebills

OLYMPIC CLUB MEMBERS
IN TOURNAMENT PLAY.
Coast':.Champi6inishjip;;-.1j^Aririanged
Probably the most popular indoor
game at - the .present time is handball.
In every athletic institution, in this city
and vicinity the Irish game Is,ln full
swing and hundreds of players- are de
veloping, their eyes and their, muscles
chasing the elusive ball. ; At- the Olym
pic Club: fully "1000 â¢members" are
devotees of the . game. â  There are four
handball courts, and these are general
ly ' crowded. ! Three of â¢ the courts
a re . used ; exclusively It for s : the .'; soft
ball,' while "the fourth is for "the. hard
ball only. The latter cost* $4000 and
is, conceded to be the finest .in the
world. . â¢
â  At the present time a soft-ball tour
nament is in progress at the Olympic
Club. Unfortunately the seating capa
city Is too small to accommodate the
members who are anxious to see thp
experts in competition. In the first
class are such experts as Henry Russ,
Louis Levy, Fred Baine, Monroe
Green, Tom Powers, Adolph Pockwitz
and Bogan. These men are able to
.play fast and control the ball, "killing"
at, will. . The second class has such
good men as G. S. Kroger, a rising
â¢young player; Guy Ransome, Clarence
Clough. Fred Sherry, Hugo Poheim and
a score of others. Lester Hammer
smfth, -Frank Hooper, Walter Young,
William McCarthy and at least twenty
others are in the. third class. The tour
nament is likely to last at least three
weeks. The victor in the first class will
be awarded a handsome medal and
will also be given an opportunity to
play the club's champion, Al Hampton,
for a handsome silver cup. Fred Baine
is picked to win the first class, with
Monroe â¢ Green runner-up. Both men
play exceptionally "l strong games and
are rivals for soft-ball honors. , ,
The games played so far in the tour
nament have been highly exciting. The
rivalry is keen and the athletes are
puttirg forth their best efforts to get
inside the money. . The committee in
charge is an energetic one and the In
terest, will not be allowed to flag.
Games are scheduled three nights a
week anrl on Sunday afternoons. Henry
Cory, the coming ; champion hard-ball
player, is referee. Al Hampton and
Louis Levy alternate as scorers.
The men who play hard-ball are
looking, forward to'the tournament to
begin in January -for the championship
of the coast. . Four members will be
selected by the Olympic, St. Ignatius,
Sacramento, Stockton and ,. Occidental
handball clubs. The games will be
played in the various courts of the city
and. vicinity. The games will.be singles
anc} the club winning the largest num-
x ber .. of games ; in > the ; series . will be

considered the best hard-ball players
in the city. . They: have been playing
the \ game for many years and will
fittingly represent the winged -"O."

The annual or semi-annual elections
of officers of .the various rowing cluba
on the bay of San Francisco take place
at this season. The members of the
Ariel Rowing Club held their annual
meeting and election of officers early
in the week, the former directors being
almost without exception re-elected.
There was a large attendance and the
results of the election caused general
satisfaction, as the members feel that
the club's interests have been well
served. The officers for the coming

cific. Association of the Amateur Ath
letic Union, with Eugene Flanders and
James Wilson as alternates.
The new boathouse of the club, near
the Arctic Oil Works, is nearly com
plete inside, the locker rooms and sola
rium being improvements that are ap
preciated highly. The club is in a
sound financial condition and has ac
quired several new boats recently. The
new officers will be installed at a din
ner to be held next month. "ladies'
day" will take place early next year at
the boathouse.
| The semi-annual ' meeting and "elec

V'A meeting of the Pacific Association
of Amateur Oarsmen was held during
the week at the Columbia Bowling Al
leys. /The constitution and by-laws as
drafted by the committee appointed for
,that purpose were read, section by sec
tion, and adopted. They follow the con
stitution and, by-laws of the National
Association of Amateur Oarsmen, with
some changes to adapt them to the con
ditions present here. Committees are at
work on the classification of oarsmen
and the preparation of rules to govern
regattas. The next meeting of the'as
sociation will be held on Tuesday even-

PLAYEES. OF PKOMISE
California Club Youngsters
Are Coming to the Front
With Marked Sapidity
There will be no tennis tournaments
of importance until Christmas day.
when a scratch doubles event will be
held on the California Club courts.
This is the first scratch event sched
uled for the club courts in many
months. It is scratch in name only.
Partners will be drawn by lot and
there is little chance of the best play
ers drawing together. An event of
this kind will be novel and interest
ing, as the element of luck cuts a
prominent figure.
There has been an epidemic of
handicap tournaments In the last year
and the better players have not been
shown the consideration due them. It
is a great strain to give large handi
caps and an occasional scratch event
would not be amiss.
Twenty-three players have already
affixed their names to the entry list,
which should total forty players be
fore the drawing takes place. The
following have entered:
C. J. Smith. Albert Kenyon. Ray SpltvaUo,
Sherwood Adams, Grant Smith, W. G.

LovÂ«(jrove. Herbert Lonjr. Melville Lons. A.
E. B^yfuss, Augustus Taylor and Spencer
Grant.
On New Year's day the annual class
singles tournament will be played.
This is one of the club's most-Import
ant events during the year and one
the players are looking forward to
with great interest. Class tourna
ments have always been popular and
it would be a good plan to hold one
every three or four months, Ju$t who
is the best man in each class Is a
question that each and every player
would like to have decided.
It will be a difficult task for the
committee to classify the players. In
the continuous tournament the- . play
ers have been put into classes, but it
Is not intended for a correct'classifi
cation. It is doubtful if there are
more than two really first class men
in the club, but the chances are many
who belong properly in the second
class will play in the first. Many of
the players are evenly matched and it
would be a difficult matter to pick the
club's best man. Dr. Chesney.is con
sidered by many to be the cleverest
player, but he would have â¢ no easy
time beating men like Allen. Janes,
Collier, Hill. Gardner and Long.
Merle Johnson leaves for New York
to-day. Will Allen will remove to the
same city early In January. This will
take two good men from the first
class and will send those below them
up a number or. two. â

who head the list, will not meet to-

nishes Surprise.
BY FRED E. MULHOLLAN
There is a way to explain the de
feat of the five beaten favorites at
Oakland yesterday, with the excep
tion of Glendennlng. That Is a dif
ficult task. To think that this speed
marvel should be outfooted and. then
run unplaced in a five-furlong jaunt
almost furpasse belief. But he, did,
and Frank Sullivan rode him. The
youngster unquestionably did the best
he could, but Frank .has lost his form
and needs. a rest. He cannot do him
self Justice. Glendenning went to the
post favorite for the fifth number,
heavily played at 3 to 5. He did not
outfoot Pickaway, and finally faded
away altogether. The winner made
himself known in Louis Ezell's bay
horse W. R. Condon, which closed
strong under Larcen's vigorous hand
ling, collaring and beating Pickaway
a neck in 1:01 flat. Old Matt Hogan
ran third. The odds about the wfn
ner receded from 8 to 10 to 1.
FOUR FAVORITES ROUTED.
Among other favorites put to route
were Phalanx. The Gadfly. Colonel
Van and Stilicho. The track .was
good, but not fast. The different
fields possessed little or no class,
which in a measure accounts for the
many d'sasters.
It finally took John Bullman to
land Harry Stover's big colt, George
P. McNear. a winner. Harry permit
ted "Bull" to carry a whip in the
opening event, an infringement of his
stable rule, and when McXear tried
any loafing tactics "Bull" would tan
his jacket with the whip. Tommy
Clark on David Boland nearly stole
the race. The latter led to the pad
dock, where he began tiring, and Mc-
Xear. under punishment, beat him a
length. Handy Bill finished a close
third. The winner was played down
:rom threes to S to 5 favoritism.
Lady Goodrich, a racy looking piece
of horssf.esh. took the six and a half
furlong run for maiden two-year-olds
from a bfg field at odds of 3 to 1.
Royal i?ed. a CO to 1 shot piloted by
i~".exn Jenkins, made all the running
ar.4 was downed less than a length at
the wirÂ«. Raker finished third. Helge
-en on the favorite. Phalanx, met with
ail sorts of poor racing luck, finally
'.ting so badly cut off that he was al
::Â»ost forced to pull up.
BUDD WADE COMES HOME.
A plunge on The Gadfly sent the colt
ii> the oost favorite over Alone and
Harka. for the Futurity course selling
cumber., Sam Greenfield, who rode
him, lo?t pome ground on the stretch
turn, and McBride with Harka beat
him out nearly a length. Vaucrhan. a
10 to 1 chance, ran a good third. Sulli
van fell asteep and nearly got Alone
loft at the post.
If Sam Greenfield lost ground with
The Gadfly he saved it on Budd Wade
in the mile and fifty yard selling af
fair, landing the "bush" horse a clever
â winner. Mocorito made the pace for
more than two thirds of the route, but
could not stand the pressure when
challenged by Colonel Van. the favor
ite, and ISudd Wade. Greenfield on
the latter f>aved so much ground on
thÂ» stretch turn that he was enabled
to down Knapp. astride the first choice.
Inspector Munro made a very poor
showing.
It's shameful to relate what Oro Viva
dia to Stilicho. the even money favor
ite for th* concluding selling run. W.
Davis rode a well-judged race on the
latter, but Oro Viva was simply a bet-

THREE LONGSHOTS LAND
Descwento, DiUifid and Mart Gentry Slip Tlvough
LOS ANGELES, Dec 16.â To-day's
card at Ascot was full of surprises,
Descuento at 20 to 1, Dutiful at 10
and Mark Gentry at 15 causing a series
of shocks to the betting public by win
ning their respective races. The other
events went to favorites. There were
sixteen books doing business and the
crowd was large. The first race had a
bunch of ordinary horses and the win
ner turned up In Descuento, with Pa T
cifico second and Retador third. The
latter two were coupled and made 1-to
2 favorites. Helgerson won the second
easily from Crigli and Liberto. Esca
lante fan a smashing race and won the
third from Tim Payne and Americano.
Delagoa was played heavily in' this
race, but ran disappointingly. Re
quiter took the best race of the day
from Mad Mullah, with Tryon third.
Requiter got a bad start, but. went
around his field and won handily in
1:41 for the mile.
Dutiful showed sudden form and won
the fifth at 10 and 12 to 1, Anirad second
and Huapala third. Lustig was a red
hot favorite, but finished far back.
Mart Gentry wound up the card by
ter h'TBt, and. well ridden by McBride,
ran: over the rlrst choice when r^ady.
Ct nsiderable 16 to 5 cowld be had about
the winner. Mlmo, the pacemaker, ran

Tommy Griffin wired Billy Cahill
from Hot Springs yesterday, asking if
it were possible to obtain fourteen
stalls at Oakland: A favorable reply
was sent and "the man with the hal

Anderson was not injured by his fall
on Thursday and wanted to ride yes
terday. His employer, Louis Ezell,
thought it better to wait until Mon
day befbre he allowed the boy to ac
cent any mounts.
\fter his exhibitions on Inspector
Munro, Alone and Glendenning the
judges decided to restrict the riding
of F. Sullivan to the stable of Bian
ohi & McGovern. Sullivan gave prom
ise of becoming a rider, but his work
v.ould indicate^that he has gone back
woefully. ,, , "
The working of the claiming clause
in this country is a widely different
story from what it is in England. If
one claims a horse across .the pond
the former owner of the thoroughbred
invites you to luncheon and points out
the good and bad traits, of the new
uurchase for your edification. Here,
if you claim a bird. "Oi! Yoi! Yoi!"
The owner from' whom you claim. the
horse invites > you to a cannon . rehear
sal and points but the particul~-v spot
where he Is going to have you planted.

Louie Ezell did not ' miss * a boost,

WRESTLING BOUT ENDS IN RIOT
Eitzayell Bites Je^kms and Is
Arrested on Charge of
The "wrestline^match between Tom
Jenkins and '-BuzayeH; \ the Algerian,
ended in ! a small-sized riot last night
at 'Woodward's pavilion. .< As a se
quence Jenkins 'was treated at the Re
ceiving Hospital for a severe wound
caused by a bite on the abdomen while
Lieutenant of> Police Price arrested
â Buzayell â¢â¢ and charged him with the
serious crime of mayhem at the Mis
sion Police Station. ;
The men had been on the. mat one
hour "and fifty-six minutes and forty
three seconds without a fall being se
cured. Just before the dramatic end
of the affair Jenkins had â¢ secured a
hammer - lock on his agile opponent.
The Algerian saw the dangerous posi
tion in which; he- was and slid oft the
mat "onto the platform. Jenkins com
plained that he was being bitten and
just then Buzayell : wriggled off the
edge of the platform- and both wrest
lers fell to the floor, of the pavilion.
They were in a" tangle for a few mo
ments.. â  -
JENKINS WINS ON AFOUL
Jenkins was the first to appear and
at once complained to Referee Roche
that he had been "severely ; bitten. He
showed a mark on his abdomen about
the size of a dollar piece which showed
the deep impression of his opponent's
teeth. The referee ," gave the bout at
once to Jenkins on afouL The latter
fearing, blood, poisoning: hastened at
once to. the hospital for treatment. The
spectators hooted'. and j jeered . Buzayell
and ; there were .repeated " calls for
Lieutenant of Police Price to arrest
him. The attack was such a vicious
one that Buzayell .was placed under
arrest and was locked up attne Seven
teenth Street Station. â¢-.* :â -.
The bout waa. one of the greatest
ever- seen in this city. The Algerian
proved a. master, of the art. and broke
one hold after another with the great
est,ease. He was,; in superb physical
condition and stood a terrible going
over from Jenkins. He .was -game to
the- core and when, Jenkins tried some
unusually rough tactics he' fought back
BRITT IS READY TO DEFEND
LAURELS AT A DAY'S NOTICE
Hard and Faithful Training ; Has Its
Effect on the Plumber Lad
-Jimmy Britt can afford to let. up on
his hard work now almost any old day.
He is practically fit . and ready : for his
comings-battle and can be at weight at
a day's/, notice. He has decided r toi keep
up his work for a day or so longer Just
to be sure that everything is all-right,
though he. will not: exert himself as he
has been doing for, the last week. ,
As 'usual,',- a vast throng clamored at
the door of the g>Tnnaslum yesterday
afternoon to see the champion - work.
Every one could not be accommodated,
and there was great fighting and shov
ing .for a chance to get a glimpse'at
the plumber boy. He was a little late
in starting in and did not devote quite
as much time to his stunts as he usu
ally does.
He only went four rounds with Frank
Rafael, but the pace was fast while it
lasted and Jimmy' kept sending that
right in with terrific force. He evi
dently figures on using it to advantage
on Nelson, for he has been paying par r
tciular attention to developing it , in
each bout with. his trainer. The left Is
naturally good and needs no practice,
and if the right holds out Jimmy
should prove a veritable battering ram.
"There is no danger of my breaking
it," 'he said. "If my old mitt can stand
the strain of these lively mfxups I am
satisfied that I will go through the fight
with Nelson without doing it any dam
age. There are more blows struck in
any of my practice bouts than In most
big fights, and the work is pretty rough,
so I feel confident" that my good right
will help me bring home the coin."

been doing with. "Tiv" Kreling has

i BARTENDER . : DIES SUDDENLY.â John
C. Meyer, 'a bartender, living ; at. 478 -'Jessie
street, 1 - died" suddenly last -Thursday ; night an
his bed.';prÂ«sumably:from.natural!cau8es. V.He
had been on . a ' spree , for i a - month and â¢; waa a
member of Eagles Aerie, No.. 8.
viciously. Early In the struggle he
butted Jenkins and the latter went at
him in good old London prize-ring
fashion. Lieutenant- of : Police Price
jumped in the ring and stopped hos
tilities. Later on they went at it
again with their fists, but it did not last
long. . .
Buzayell was on the defensive from
first to last and the one disappointment
of the spectators was that he did not
take the offensive and show what he
could do at that style of : going. On
the few occasions when he was on the
offensive for a moment Jenkins would
at once get him Into difficulties.
Jenkins was hampered by having to
wrestle in the Graeco- Roman style, as
he is accustomed to catch-as-catch
can.
BTJZAYELI/S STRONG MUSCLES.
On many occasions Jenkins started to
get a hold in the latter style and then
stopped Instantly when he remembered
it was barred. . The colored man held
out for the match to be decided on a
flying fall. Jenkins wanted the pin
fall, which means that one man must
pin the shoulders of his opponent to
the mat before the fall be allowed.
After they had been wrestling more
than an hour Jenkins threw the Alge
rian with a body hold, but as he did
not pin him down It did not count. This
was the closest to a fall that was
scored during the bout until the last
exciting moment. Buzayell seems to
have muscles like steel cables in his
neck, as he broke one hold after an
other with marvelous ease.
The bout between George Braun, the
ex-Olympic Club wrestler, and Charles
Davis was a joke. Davis knew nothing
about wrestling and Braun toyed with
him. He threw him the flijpt time in
one minute and fifty-six seconds. The
next bout he won in three minutes and
twenty-nine seconds, but it was not al
lowed, It being a flying fall. Braun
then threw him for the third time in
one minute and fifty- three seconds.
"William McCullough refereed this bout,
while Billy Roche passed upon the
main event;
helped him ; wonderfully. It "baa : tended
to make him a bad man in the clinches
and ; increased his speed to . a marked
degree. 1 ;.. This is the hardest kind of
work* and the, sort which wears a man
down.' Jimmy thinks he can withstand
the .toughest ..'. fighter in the business
after v all the practice scrimmages he
has indulged in during the last two
weeks..' o-_'
.The .members of the sporting, frater
nity who Journeyed to â  Larkspur yes
terday, with the expectation of seeing
Battling- Nelson work were-sorely dis-r
appointed, as the Great Dane has taken
a lay, off until. Sunday. Manager Mur
phy says Bat is in excellent condition,
and within striking distance of: the
weight. ; He a"lso states that -he ap
preciates the fact that his protege has
worked like a Trojan during this siege
of training, so ordered him to take a
rest until Sunday.
. The Dane took a short sprint in the
morning as an eye-opener, and spent
the remainder of the day hunting. The
large crowd of spectators had * to be
content with watching A Eddy Santry
and "Rawhide" Kelly "do their gym
stunt..T3at did not take'klndly
phy's orders, as he is a gluttonT f or
work, but thought it* best to obey the

but it leaked out : yesterday.. - On 'the

Experts Favor Dr. Ix>jjan.
> Three physicians and a business man
decjaved in Judge Coffey's court yester
day that. Dr.' Milburn H. Logan was
mentally and physically competent to
manage his own affairs. The hearing
was upon Dr. Logan's application for

mitted to the, asylum; at Agnews . and
has recently been released as cured,
but there ; has been no formal dis

the court's jurisdiction In the matter
was raised and further evidence .will be
taken next week, when Dr. Stocking

STATE SHOULD
PRODUCE MORE
Articles Imported Could Be
Raised Here in Quanti
ties to Supply Demand
The California Promotion Committee
has compiled statistics relating to the
Imports of articles that ought to be
produced In California in quantities
sufficient to satisfy the home market,
and shows that In the fiscal year
the Importations from other States
Â« mounted to more than 53.000 tons. The
following summary illustrates this:
Butter and eggs, 7171.5 tons; poultry, 4227;
cheese, 2002; tams and bacon, 603; beef and
pork. 2044; lard, 35flÂ«; meat in bulk, 11,012;
tallow and grease, 132; packing-house products
7253; cottolene, 630; tankage. 360; livestock,
20.650; total (in tons) of imports, 69,550.5
Continuing, the committee statisti
cian says: .
The exports of the same products for the
same period were only 714 tons, of which there
were 41 tons of butter, 20 tons of packlng
houss products, 13 tons of lard and the re
mainder belnff livestock. The figures given
are conservative. In all cases where ship
ments have been made In carload lots, the
minimum carrying capacity for th* different
invoieea have been. taken. If the average had
been taken these figures would show up bigger
than they do, but for the sake of over-stating
the lowest possible estimate is given in every
case. The amount of poultry Imported into
th* State during the fiscal year ending June
30, 1804. Is close to 8,000,000 pounds and It Is
believed by the committee that for the year
1904 almost 10,Câ¬0,000 pounds of poultry will
have been brourht from Eastern -States.
California pays million* of dollars to tha
East for these nroducts.. Were the imports
enumerated in the table given to be estimated
as low as ten cents per pound they would have
a valuation of 511,910,100, but butter, eggs
and poultry, as w*ll as most of the other
products enumerated, arc not to be shipped
here to take the place of California products
at these figures, hh anyone who raises poultry
knows. The committee believes that the
amount of money sent out of the State each
year for products which could be raised on
the small farm reaches far up into the mil'
lion... Besides the articles given In the com
mittee's table*. . thousand* of tons of vege
tables of every kind are brought Into California
every year. All these articles can be -raised
here not only to supply Callfornians, but to
supply the markets of the world. The supply
of poultry products In moat localities through
out the State Is not nearly equal to the de
mand and this Is brought out practically by
the products herein enumerated.

PARK WILL HAVE
ATHLETIC TRACK!
The Board of Park Commissioners
yesterday decided to accept the money
collected by the members of the Ameri
can Driving and Athletic Association,
and will begin work on the proposed
new athletic grounds in Golden Gate
Park on January 2. At the time the
grounds were projected the Commis
sioners" decided to prosecute the work
provided that the athletic association
raise $25,000. Yesterday members of the
association were before the board and
stated that the contributions amounted
to $17,799 99, with J2885 promised.
W, J. Simpson, I. L. Borden and
Frank O'Kane, who appeared for the
association, said that those who were
mainly interested in the completion of
athletic grounds were the most back
ward in contributing, and that most oi
the money came from the merchants
and business" men of the city. They
complained that the $25,000 limit set by
the commission .was excessive and that
they could raise but $20,000 at the most.
When asked if they could turn over
the $20,000 witjiin a week they admit
ted that it was impossible, and Com
missioner Lloyd asked for a guarantee
before the commission proceeded with
the work. The committe was unable to
promise a guarantee, and President
Adolph Spreckels came to their relief
with a guarantee that the $20,000 would
be forthcoming. The commission then
'instructed* Park Superintendent Mc-
Laren to proceed with the drawing up
of the plans.
A. J. Lyon, editor of the Pacific Gold
smith, was awarded the Park News
concession for one year at' $250 per
month. Phillins & Van Orden bid $1SO
and Owen Smythe $165 per month.
The question of speeding automobiles
and the exchanging of license numbers
came on, and the police will be asked
to arrest any autoist holding a license
upon which there is no photograph.
The police have also been instructed to
keep the bicycle paths in the park free
from pedestrians.
Still Consider Roof Repair Law
The Supervisors' joint Fire and Ju
diciary Committee again considered
the proposed ordinance requiring
roofs to be repaired with fireproof
material within certain limits. The
matter was discussed by insurance
men, shingle dealers and Chief Sulli
van of the Fire Department,, who said
that a similar ordinance had been
passed by the Supervisors some years
ago, but had been vetoed by the
Mayor. The committee decided to
defer the matter until next Friday at
3 p .m., when the Mayor will be in
vited to take part in the debate.

PROPOSE GAME
LAW MOVEMENT
Sportsmen Agitate Framing
Measure to Protect Wild
Ducks, Deer and Trout
Twelve prominent sporting clubs of
the State were represented at the meet
ing held last evening at the rooms of
the Rod and Gun Association, Mills
building, to outline a plan of action for
the fostering of the' Interests of sports
men of the State and for framing laws
to be presented at the next legislative
session for the protection of game.
The clubs represented by delegates or
by proxies were the Petaluma Sports
men's Association, the El Toro Club,
the Park Home Club, the Green Valley
Club, the Cordelia Club, the Ibis Club,
the San Francisco Striped Bass Club,
the Empire Club, the Colusa Club, the
Field and Tule Club and the Point
Reyes Sportsmen'! Club.
. On the 15th of last month the asso
ciated clubs met in convention at Visa
lla for the purpose of discussing pro- j
posed game laws. The bill framed on
that occasion was taken as a text for |
discussion last night and was read in
sections by Chairman Frank E. Bell,
and each of these amended by a "rec- |
ommendation" or allowed to stand as
adopted by the Visalia convention. The |
laws to be advocated and worked for at 1
Sacramento by the sportsmen of the
State will be in brief as follows: i
That the duck season remain as at j
present; that the limit of a bag shall'
be fifty ducks the man; that the sale
of game shall be prohibited; that there '
shall be a penalty for offense that shall j
apply equally with every duck in a bag j
over the limitâ that is, if a hunter has t
ten birds over the bag he can be pun
ished on ten separate. charges; that the
open deer season shall be from the 15th
of July to the 15th of October; that the
shoot limit for deer shall be two bucks
the season: that tree squirrels shall be
protected at all times; that all sports
men and hunters must procure a li
cense, paying %2 per season month for
same: that the law governing the
catching of striped bass shall remain
as it is; that the trout limit shall be j
fifty fish, a twenty-pound mess and a j
limit to three-pound fish; that the sale'
of steelhead salmon shall be prohlb- i
ited: that the catching of trout be- i
tween the hours of 8 p. m. and 4 a. m.
shall be prohibited.
The money raised by licensing sports
men and market 'hunters is to be used
in the enforcing of the fish and game
laws. A committee will probably be
sent to Sacrarnnto to work in the in
terest of the laws, and the
clubs themselves will set aside funds j
to help in the work. The clubs
in all parts of the State will be asked
to assist in promoting the bill or bills
to be introduced and to lend their po
litical and business influence to bring 1
about results. I
Evenlng School Exercises.
The senior class of the Humboldt

of a character to discourage farther opera

that any further attacks will be made by the
Boston B3aculator. It iÂ« now the purpose ot
the dominant interests to bring about a res
tomtion of confidence, but while this is in
rrocress no aggressive buli manipalation â¢Â»
likely. The buying of good nulroÂ«d stocks to

Sentiment continues generally bearish on the

product. Traders will, however, be inclined
to oversell the Tr-arln*. especially on the weak

unlnterruiited than a.t any previous time on

taticnx which have develciwl at some time
every day were lacking and the day's gains
wenf- hpld Â»ith corr.r*-rattve firmness. Hew
much this may have' been, due to the sJmcst
mildness of the adjurtrcent of personal dif
ference* frow'.ng out cf the stock-market con
test and Monday's Sharp tension, which has
extended to both sides of the Atlantic, It
would be difficult to Â«ay. But the prevailing
â¢mile with which the affair has been regarded
took on leÂ«* ejection to-day, and the coinci
dence cf the restored confidence manifest in
the market did not escar>e. notice. N&twlth
Â«*ndinr the restoration of vliror of the mar

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Dec. 1Â«.â Widespread demand for
ctsh wheat was the main cause of a â¢ strong
market in speculative options here to-day.
At the close May wheat was up %Â®?ic. Corn
shews a gain of Vi'H'hP- Oats are up, !jgi;c.
Prorisions are practically unchanged. "
Sentiment in the wheat pit at the opening
v.-a* rather bearish as a result of lower cables
and a material increase in shipments from
Argentina. Initial quotations on May' ."â¢ wera
orf \<ifiV*c at ?r 10?Â»@l 10t$. News from the
â  Ncrthwcet, however, was -or a continued bull
ash tenor.. As a result the, market here soon
developed a stronger tone. ..- One report from
Minneapolis stated that the demand for cash
wheat there was of a roost excellent char
acter. Another report was that sales of low
gr&de wheat to go. to Kansas City had been
made during the day. These -. advices . were
given additional weight by good buying or
ders from Northwestern commission houses.
The market received, additional strength
through a report from St." Louis to the effect
that Indiana and â¢.Ohio millers are buying
wheat, In the Southwest. A feature of trading
during the lattÂ»r part of the -session was an
urgent demand for â  December delivery. There
was. a resultant advance of 2i;c in the price
of that option: Shorts were the principal
buyers of December. Meantime May advanced
l%c from" the low point of the day, selling
ur- to $1 ll*i. Part of the gain was subse
quently, lost on profit- takine, tiut the market
closed strong. Final quotations on May were
at $1 11 ',Â©1 11%.
Influenced by loyer cables and increased
shipments from Argentina an easier tone pre
vailed in the corn market. May closed %c
hither at 45?Â»c. . ,
Oats were (ixra throughout' the 4ay. May
Closed unchanged at 31^4c
On fair support by packers the provision
market .held firm. Pork closed 2Â»*g5c higher,
lard 'a shade lower and. ribs unchanged.

chiefly of frost- bitten and otherwise poor
stock, were received and prices had a sharp
decline. Onions "were dull and the top quota

Choice offerings, of southern Vegetables con
tinued to find ready sale at good prices. To
matoes were ' very scarce, and. there were no
Lima Beans offering. Receipts â  of Mushrooms

weak at a lower range of prices. Over 100

Butter, Cheese and Ecss.
Conditions in- all descriptions remain as be
fore and prices show no change. Butter anÂ£
Eggs are moving eff very well and dealers ex
press themselves as satisfied with trade, hence
are not disposed to disturb the market in any
way, saying. "Let well enough aione.V But
most of them report a firm feeling in Butter.
The demand for Chee*? about balances the
supply, both being moderate.

The cool weather was not conducive to the

Oranges were seven cars, and Included one

which was firmly held at â¢ the top quotation,
while fancy stock from other sections was
being offered freely at $1 50<6rl 75 per box.
Apples continued steady, with a good demand
reported for medium priced stock. Strawber

Dried Fruits, Xnts, Raisins, Honey.
There Is nothing new to report under this
bead. Trade continues dull and of a holiday
character. . -
Late mall advices from New York say of
Prunes and Raisins: Increasing firmness is
shown by holders of Prunes both here and on
the Pacific Coast, which Is due to the â¢car
city ot desirable sizes, as heretofore noted.
There. la no indication of Improvement in the
demand from distributors cere. Buying is
regulated by the wants ef the moment, and
as these are unimportant Individual transac
tions in spot goods involve small quantities
only. We hear of little business for forward
shipment. Some inquiry is noted for 30*-40fl
Oregon Italian Prunes on the spot, with eaies
of small lots at 6%(?C%c as to seller and
quantity. There continues a moderate Job
. bing demand for spot Apricots, and Peaches
, at the full quoted prices. California Raisins
on the spot are quiet and we hear of nothing
, doing in shipments from the coast, where the
market Is higher and' firmer than here. For
'â¢ Malagas both bunches and loose there Is re
! ported to be a fair demand and the market
has a steadier tone. - Currants are selling well.
- the demand - being chiefly for cleaned. The
market Is firm."

The friends of James â  \V. Coffroth,
for many years secretary ,of the SuÂ«

that he intends to resign his position
at the ' end of the month. Coffroth
finds that his outside business ventures

Ccffroth. with the assistance of his
friends, was Instrumental in having the

retary a statutory appointment within
the gift of the twelve Superior Judges.
Besides, having the "respect of his
friends in' public life, Coffroth is a so

and athletics. In speaking last night
of his proposed resignation, â _ hie said:
"I. have been in the position so ions
that I shall be extremely sorry to leave

conscientiously attend to _ my official

HOMELESS BOYS TRAINED V v
TO. BE AGRICULTURISTS
St. Joseph's Institute at Ruthci-rord,
Napa. County, Is Accomplishing
Commendable Work.
St. Joseph's Agricultural Institute at
Rutherford, which. is now starting on
its third year, has already proved that
it is an indispensable adjunct of the
Youths' Directory. Untold good is be
ing done by the institution. There, the
useful and healthy, work of the farm is
taught to' boys, who might otherwise
swell the ranks of the unemployed ana
vicious in the â¢ cities. Father . D. O.
Crowley of the Youths' Directory real
ized the necessity of a. place of this
sort several years ' ago and it was
through. his efforts that the big^Ruth
erford farm Was bought. He saw that
there were opportunities outside of
the- trades and professions for the
homeless lads taken in by the Youths'
Directory. .â 
At Rutherford hundreds of boys are
being trained to be .'agriculturists. As
The Callsaid editorially when the pro
ject was 'first started: "The movement
to carry boys back to the . land and
give them ; a training for scientific
farming, is in line with the trend of
thought of the most earnest men and
women of our time." That the State
needs scientific agriculturists is ad
mitted generally. - St. Joseph's . Agri
cultural School is preparing to supply
that want.' â¢ The Xavierian Brothers
have charge of the education of the
embryo farmers.

POOR TO FEAST
ON CHRISTMAS
Salvation Army Is Preparing
Its Annual Dinner for
San Francisco's Needy
GENEROSITY A-PLENTY
Children :of Public Schools
Bring Contributions to
Aid in Charity's 7 Cause
The Salvation Army in San Fran
cisco, as in all other parts of the world
where it is quartered, is again busy at
this season, arranging to give its an
nual public Christmas dinner. This. will
take place in the banquet room of the
Odd Fellows 1 builldng, Seventh and
Market streets. The number in this
city which has usually, taken ad
vantage of the. philanthropic, ottering
has been in the neighborhood of 1500,
and preparations are making to enter
tain that many this year. '
Six years ago 20,000 of the poor of the
United States were invited to the
Christmas I feast and 50,000 accepted.
The result on that occasion led the
army to increase the invitations the
folio wing year to 100.000. A year' later
200,000 .were invited. Last "**ar P the
total reached about 300,000. â  '. %
The dinners are given by two meth
ods. First, by the distribution of well
lilled baskets of uncooked food, con
taining ample provisions of great va
riety for a family of five; second, by
the gathering or the invited poor about
a well-loaded table, as will be the case
on Christmas Â«lay at Odd Fellows' Hall.
Ii: many cities where the climate is
particularly severe the poor are further
