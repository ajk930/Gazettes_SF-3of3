" The Daily Chronicle's Tokio corre

be made on a well-known vulnerable
point in the, defenses. The correspond

which was destined for Tientsin, and
that Viceroy Yuan " Shal Khai has
strongly, protested against* this action.
According to telegrams from Shang

" GUNS FOR' BOMBARDMENT. ' â¢
SHANHAIKWAN, ' May 10.â The
Japanese first army, vigorously follow
ing up its first victory at the Yalu, is
already threatening the Russian posi
tion at Haicheng. The army is march
ing in three divisions. The second army
pushed quickly up to co-operate with
General Kuroki's force and jointly.de-,
feated the Russians near Wafungtien
yesterday. The Russians suffered great
loss. The Japanese artillery was splen
didly handled. The Japanese dragged
their guns up heights the Russians
thought to . be insurmountable. After
the fight the' Russians ; resumed their
retreat north.
LONDON, May 11.â Thus far no con
firmation has reached London of the
reported battle near Liaoyang. One of
the explanations of the restoration of
the Port Arthur, railroad \ suggested
here is that the landing of the Japa
nese at Pitzewo was interrupted by a
gale, which compelled their temporary
retirement to the coast, or that the
Japanese are allowing, the line to re
main open- for the removal of non
combatants from Port Arthur prior to
a bombardment. â¢
"There is no reason to keep the
strength of the garrison at Port' Ar
thur a secret," said the informant of
the Associated Press. . "The Japanese
know It because of their perfect In
formation. We have 20,000 soldiers
and 10,000 sailors there. The latter
will not be used on the fortifications
except as a last .extremity. The Jap
anese will not obtain possession of
our fleet even if they capture Port Ar
thur. The orders to the commander
there are that he shall, when after all
Is inevitable, put to see and engage the
enemy. We do not propose for the
Japanese to find in the harbor a num
ber of valuable warships which they
can sÂ«>ize and add to their fleet. More
over, in battle. the Japanese will suffer
as well as our ships, and those of the
latter which do not escape win go to
the bo^om."
The suggestion of another Japanese
debarkation Is generally discredited.
The force acting independently Is be
lieved to be attached to General Kuro
ki's army. Whether or not an army
was landing, the fact was impressed
upon the Associated Press by a mem
ber of the general staff that the Jap
anese are placing Southern Manchuria
absolutely under control before be
ginning a forward movement, thus
guaranteeing against threatened Cos
sack raids. Whether General Kuroki
intends to move on Liaoyang and Hai
cheng has not yet developed, though
action agaitfst the latter place does not
now appear so probable. In view of
the dispatch of a force to Kunaginsin.
a third army had landed at Takushan
it could have moved to Fengwangcheng
and flanked. the Russians in case Gen
eral Kurokl had encountered strong
opposition.
There .has -. probably _ been some
fighting, but whether with Japanese
vessels or with troops north. of Pitzewo
Is not known, nor. has tne whereabouts
of the Japanese landed on the southern
part ' of the Liaoyang peninsula been
definitely ascertained. It is safe to
say, however, that no engagement of
importance has occurred to re-estab
lish communication. Undoubtedly ne"ws
of. such a victory would: be made pub
lic promptly owing to the state of the
temper of the people to-night. -All-im
patience arising .from General Kuro
patkin's gradual withdrawal has dis
appeared. The Japanese, seeing that
the - withdrawal . was thorough, ; . and
with. the care that .has distinguished
their past operations, after â¢Â¦ making
sure that no- Russians -w;ere left be
hind, cut the vital line of communica
tions. Â¦ . . . t Â¦ â¢ .Â¦ . "

from the front up to this hour is that
telling of the complete re-establlshment
of railroad and telegraphic communica
tion with Port Arthur, though how it
was brought about and whether a bat
tle was' necessary to accomplish it are
mysteries which Viceroy Alexieff failed
to clear up.
â¢ The elation of the authorities over
this achievement is sobered by official
dispatches showing the activity of the
Japanese in Eastern Manchuria.
Kuanggensiang (Huangtlangsal), fifty,
miles northeast of Â¦ Fengwaagcheng,
was occupied by the Japanese May 5.
This enables an advance along the bad
roads to the flank either at Liaoyang
or Mukden.
The territory between the main road
to Fengwangcheng and the river Ta
yang has been penetrated by such a
strong force of Japanese as to lead
to the suggestion that another army
has landed at Takushan, of which the
outside world has not before heard.
The Japanese have been expected and,
therefore, it has not diminished the
satisfaction felt at the opening of com
munication with Port Arthur. Â¦ *

Benson, a suburb of Omaha, has filed
a claim against the estate of his uncle,
Benjamin Bates, for salary at $5 a

plans for taking care of ; this travel
and the improvement of the terminals
of the : Illinois Central. These plans
were finally adopted by the railroad
company, and Mr. Wallace > was ap
pointed chief engineer of -Oie Illinois
Central. During the seven ; years he
occupied this position the Illinois Cen
tral property was practically rebuilt.
January 1. 1S38, he was appointed as
sistant second vice * president. While
still retaining supervision over; the
engineering department, he was call
ed upon to assist the second vfee pres
ident' In the general supervision of
matters connected with the operation
of the railroad. On January 1. 1901,
Wallace's iitle was changed to as

"There is no profeesionel engineer
in my acquaintance who, I think,
has in a higher degree than
Mr. Wallace the special commer
cial and diplomatic tact which I con
ceive will be required. He not only
has commercial sense, knows the value
of money, but also has a very rare
capacity in dealing with men, whether
they be above him, bis peers, or under
him. It just goes without saying that
he is upright and downright."
Wallace was born at Fall River,
Mass.. and educated as civil engineer
at Monmouth University. Monmouth,
111., of which his father, the Rev. D.
A. Wallace, was founder and first
president. In 1S69 he entered the ser

CHICAGO, May 10.â During the re
cent trip of the Panama Canal Com
missioners to the Isthmus one of the
subjects of discussion was the appoint
ment of the chief- engineer. It was
agreed by every one that the man
selected must possess exceptional qual
ifications; must . be not only an en
gineer, but an administrator and ex
ecutive: must have mature judgment
and yet energy of accomplishment;
must be well known and favorably
known, as a larce proportion of the
success of the commission would de
pend on the chief engineer.
While the commission was at sea on
the way to the isthmus a letter was
written to Wallace, asking him to
meet the members in New York on
their return and talk over the matter.
Subsequently there was correspondence
with Stuyvesant Fish, president of the
Illinois Central, who thus spoke of Mr.
Wallace:
PRAISE FOR WALLACE.
In regard to the*' salary to-be paid
Wallace. Admiral j Walker 'said,, that
when a man undertakes, to direct the
construction of the Panama canal pro
ject it is necessary for nlm to burn
his ships behind him, and that 525,000
is not too high for a man competent
for so important a trust. .
"Whoever undertakes that task gives
up his business in',' this country, for it
wi!l require all his .time on the isthmus
for an- indefinite period," said the Ad
miral.
NEEDS THE SALARY.
"Mr. Wallace has been considered for
some time by members of the canal
commission for the position of chief
engineer." said Admiral Walker. "No
one stands higher in his profession or
Is better equipped to take up the work
mapped out than he, and the commis
sion is to be congratulated on secur
ing the services of such a man."
Wallace will take up hte work with
the commission on June 1. He will ar
rive In Washington on or before that
date and for the present will have his
offices at the headquarters of the
commission in this city. It has not
been determined wlien he will visit the
isthmus, all matters of detail being
left for a future conference with the
commission.
WASHINGTON'. May 10.â Admiral
Walker, president of the Panama Canal
Commission, received a telegTam from

Edward Crawford, a marine fireman,
of 572 Folsom street and Charles Trul
sen of 334D Bryant street called at the
Morgue last night and identified the
body of the man that was found un
der the cars in the Southern Pacific
freight yards last Sunday morning as
that of Conrad Jacbsen. They assert
ed that they believed he had met with
foul play. They stated they saw him
last at 6 o'clock Saturday nightâ the
night preceding the * discovery of his
mangled body. When they last saw
Jacbsen he was in the company of a
lottery ticket seller named Glen, whom
they think lived on Bryant street. The
dead man at the time had $20 or $25 on
his person.
When the corpse of Jacbsen was
found Sunday morning under a car at
Fifth and Townsend streets the skull
had been crushed in. Search through
the dead man's clothes failed to revear
any property. To all appearances the
man had been run. over by a train of
freight cars and dragged for a block.
His clothes were torn into shreds and
his body horribly cut and "bruised.
Crawford and Trulsen say Jacbsen
was a Norwegian sailor, 25 years of age
and lived at 754 Folsom street. Last
Saturday night he was at Crawford's
house, at 572 Folsom street. About 6
o'clock he. left. About 8 o'clock on the
same night they saw him with Glen on
â¢Bryant street. Jacbsen had been drink-
Ing heavily and was under the influence
of liquor at -the time. Trulsen formerly
roomed with Jacbsen.
V Deputy Coroner Brown reported thÂ§
matter" to Captain Martini and detec
tives will be detailed on the case. The
pockets were in such a torn condition
at the time of the discovery of Jacb
sen's body it is possible that any money
he. may have -had on his' person at the
time of his death was lost when his
body was dragged beneath the cars.

be one of great importance among in

is indirectly involved,- and the good
faith, if not the honesty, of one of his
examiners.
"Mr. Edison," the President is re

he shall be given an opportunity to be

'The order of the President that a
hearing be granted was given after
the Commissioner had refused to take
up the case. Mr. Edison, who has taken
out more patents in this country than
any individual in the .world, made ap

connection with his storage battery,
which he has said would revolutionize
motor carriages and " greatly benefit

HONOLULU, May- 4.â Irregularities
in the method of. handling Government
moneys en the part of land agents on
the island of Hawaii have been un
earthed by Land /'Commissioner Pratt
and Deputy Attorney General Peters.
Three months ago Governor Carter re
quested the resignation "of Land -Agent
E. D. Baldwin, but it was only last
week that he squared up his accounts
with the Government- by paying "over
two checks amounting to $4716 26 and
a further sum of $1200 in cash.
"vVilliam K. Ragsdale. another land
agent, also had to 'account for collec
tjons that he had made. He had been
la the habit of treating fees and rentals
IÂ»aid to him as if they were his private
funds, depositing them In bank to his
personal account and without entering
.the payments in the office records.
" He tried to justify his action by rep
resenting that he was only following an
old custom in withholding the money
until the land patents were obtained
# from the head office in Honolulu. The
Attorney General's department is, con
sidering whether it! has sufficient
grounds on which . to base criminal
prosecutions. <_. .â¢

ed to the official report of M. Pavloff.
Russian Minister to Korea, which was
gazetted In the Official Messenger;
stating that the commander of the

warships Variag and Korietz. ThÂ«
bureau produced the following extract
from- the report of- Commander W. A.
Marshall, commanding the Vicksbur?
at Chemulpo, which the officials re
gard as a complete rebuttal:
"About 12:30 p. m., February 9. both
Russian vessels, Korietz and Variag.
headed . in toward their anchorage at
full speed and j as they approached it
was seen that the Variag had a list
to port and appeared to be on fire aft
on the port quarter,* a number of Jap
anese in pursuit, until about a mile
inside of Yodollm, but not firing, ai
the foreign men-of-war were directly
in Jine of flre. when they gave up the
chase and rejoined their squadron out

At 12:50 the Variag anchored about
400 yards to the northward and west
ward of â¢ the Talbot, with the Elba
about 600 yards to the southward of
her. On learning that she had quite
a number of. wounded nven I sent our
medical officers on board to render
assistance. 'The same was done by the
Talbot, Elba and Pascal. A little later
on, on its being reported that the
Variag was In a sinking condition, two
of our cutters and the whaleboat, with
boats from the other cruisers, assisted
in taking off her personnel and put

Elba. Two Russian engineer officers
were brought on board the Vicksburg

on my offering to have the Zafiro used
as temporary quarters, they were
taken to the Elba, where their captain
detained them and declined my offer
with thanks."
It is pointed out by the chief of the

LONDON. May 10.â Baron Suye
matsu, son-in-law of Marquis Ito and
former Japanese Minister of the In?
terior, who lately arrived here by way
of the United States, in the course dt
an interview to-day with reference to
the fears expressed on the continent
as to the effect of -Japanese successes
on Japan's policy after the war, de
clared emphatically that Japan's pol
icy is well defined and her success will
make no difference. The future status
of Korea would be that of a Japanese
Cuba or a Japanese Egypt. Russia
will not be allowed the least, political
or territorial hold there. Regarding
Manchuria, Japan desires no rights
there beyond what are enjoyed by the
other powers.
Manchuria will be given back to
China under conditions^ Possibly Man
churia may be made a buffer State
under China's sovereignty. Discussing
China's neutrality, M. Suyematsu said
the chief danger was Russia, which
was either willingly or unconsciously
irritating the Chinese, thus tending to
a breach of neutrality. He did not be
lieve that any change in China's at
titude would involve France or Ger
many In the' issues of the war, and
concluded with declaring that Japan's
aims were perfectly legitimate, her
policy being to Insure absolute-freedom
for all the powers in the Far East, and
no Occidental power need' have the
slightest anxiety that Japan will suf
fer from "swelled head" as a result
of the conflict.
Russian. Embassador at Washington
Learns of Situation at Port Arthur.
WASHINGTON, May 10.â Count
Cassini, the Russian Embassador, has
received a dispatch from St. Peters
burg saying that Viceroy Alexieff tel
egraphed the Emperor that railroad
communication with Port Arthur was
restored during the night of May 9-10
and that the telegraph line is being
repaired.
NEWS REACHES CASSIXI.
The same correspondent says that
the sole object of the Japanese foreign
loan is to secure a gold currency sys
tem and to maintain the convertibility
of notes. The loan will not be used
to finance the war and, therefore, the
entire proceeds will be kept as a cur
rency â¢ reserve, probably in London.
The Standard's correspondent at
Tientsin considers that the procedure
of the Chinese Government requires
careful observation. He says he does
not desire to appear as an alarmist, but
he thinks that China's military activity
and .the accumulation - of -,â¢ funds at
Peking are not entirely upconnected
with the Russian scare, and that the
powers *would be .wise '.to, strengthen
their "positions unobtrusively and' to
watch every movement closely, i
I LONDON, May 11.â The Shanghai
: correspondent of' the Morning Post,
Â¦ under date of May. 10, says that the
, Japanese army is advancing in three
I divisionsâ the first from Fengwang-
( cheng toward Liaoyang, the -Seco-nd
from Poladien and Chuchon to Yung
yaocheng, and the third from Kujien
cheng to Kuliensin with the object of
severing communication with the rear
of Llaoyang, where only small prepar
ations foT defense have been made.
Spenser Wilkinson, .in an article in
the Morning Post, thinks there is iio
.inherent probability in . the foregoing
suggestion. Two armies are advanc
ing against General Kuropatkln from.
Fengwangcheng and from Port Adams
1 via Kaiping and the third to Kuroki's
right with a view of turntng the Rus
sian left, but Mr. Wilkinson adds it is
impossible to say whether the Shang
hai dispatch is based on guesswork or
on authentic information.
The correspondent of the Times at
Tokio says it appears that the capture
of Fengwangcheng.; was effected, not
by the troops which fought on the
Yalu, but by a mixed brigade under
Major General Sasaki, which, march-'
ing eastward, on April 20,' crossed the
Yalu at Chengseng ana moved on
Fengwangcheng by a mountain road.
The correspondent says that General
Kuroki has issued a general order re
minding the troops that they were not
fighting against the Chinese, but
against the Russians, and insisting on
the utmost consideration for the
Chinese, who had been reduced to a
pitiable condition -by the presence of
the Russian forces %nd were now
obliged to endure the passage of , the
Japanese army.
WASHINGTON. May 10.â Russia's
protest to the United States against
the action of the Japanese in firing on
the Red Cross train from Port Arthur
May 6 and striking two of the 200
wounded aboard, was sent to the State
Department to-night by Count Cassini,
the Russian Embassador, in a note to
the Secretary of State. Similar pro
tests have been addressed to all the
powers signatory to The Hague ' and
Geneva conventions. In his note Count
Cassini merely states that- by direction
of his Government he respectfully calls
to the attention of the Washington
Government this action of the Jap
anese, which the Russian Government
is compelled to regard as an open vio
lation of the Geneva and The Hague
conventions.
"There are some cases of dysentery
and smallpox and several cases of ty
phus in the Mukden hospital, but there
has beemno application for more sur
geons nor for special remedies or ser
um, and it is entirely misleading to
say that epidemics exist. Smallpox and
typhus are endemic in. Manchuria and
dysentery is inevitable where . large
lodies of men are crowded together.
There is nothing alarming in the sit
uation."
ST. PETERSBURG, May 10.â Russia
has protested to the Powers signatory
of The Hague and Geneva conven
tions against the action of the Japan
ese in firing on the Red Crosa trains
from Port Arthur May 6, when of 200
sick and wounded on the cars two were
struck by the Japanese bullets.
The general staff is authority for the
statement that the health of the Rus
sian troops is exceptionally good,.con
sidering: the filthy Chinese hovels along
the line of march, which it is some
times impossible to keep the men from
entering. The total number of cases
in the hospitals does not exceed 1 per
cent of the Russian forces. The con
dition of Mukden Is no worse than
other places.

HONOLULU, May 4.â Uncle Sam
has just lost about $4000 in customs

years ago a Japanese imported some
jelly in tins, which- the customs of
ficials classified as confectionery, sub
ject to a duty of 4 cents a pound and
15 per cent ad valorem. The importer
contended that it was an article for
which no provision had been made in
the tariff schedule and that it should
be assessed only at 20 per cent duty.
An appeal waa taken and the importer
has been sustained.

It was appealed from the decision of

duty on his estate. The House of
Lords in giving t judgment expressed
doubt as to whether Winans intended
to abandon his American domicile, but
said the. crown certainly had not made,

Count Oriola thought that the fact
that only seven of the thirty-six pic
tures taken from the galleries and sent
to St. Louis were painted after 1892
proved that the Government had not
been successful in filling the vacancy
caused by slighting the impressionists.
BERLAM, May 10.â The Reichstag to
day again intervened in the long quar
rel of the German art factions which j
the preparations for the. art exhibit at !
the St. Louis Exposition forced upon
public attention. The impressionists
have ajways bitterly resented the Em- |
peror's partiality for the classical
school, but lacked the occasion to ap- .
peal to the Reichstag until, as they
claimed, the action of the Government j
rendered their participation in the St. |
Louis exhibit impossible. i
There have been many debates in the j
Reichstag on the subject, but until to- j
day no opportunity was found for ac- j
tion. A resolution adopted almost urian- :
imously demanding funds voted for art ,
purposes be expended among the repre- j
sentatives of the various tendencies >ac
cording to just principles. ;
Deputy Arendt criticized the sending '
to St. Louis of a picture by Frank Stuck i
after the Reichstag had refused to al- Â¦
low It to be hung in its precincts.
Count von Posadowsky-Wehner, the :
Home Secretary, answered amid laugh- j
ter that the picture cost $7500. and he
hoped it would find a. purchaser in the j
United States. "
â¢A receiving order in bankruptcy was Â¦
i*-sued against Ernest Terah Hocley j
Jun* 8. lbSS. Hooley at that time was j
the biggest company promoter in Great j
Britain. He was prominently inter
ested in bicycle, land and meat ex
tiartion concerns and was supposed
tÂ» bo a multi-millionaire. He reached
the pinnacle of his prominence in 1896, !
jvhen he promoted a tire company, as I
the result of whU-h he was supposed j
to have cleared Jir.500,000. At that j
time he was living a sort of Count of
Monte Cristo existence, buying yachts
"and race horse? and a number of his
toric country soats.
The announcement of the banferupt
â¢cy proceedings against Hooley caused
a gx<-at sensation in London, though in i
rhe best infer med quarters his failure j
had been expected for some time, ow- j
ing to his inability to float a large j
Chinese loan. Eventually Hooley was i
formally adjudged bankrupt. The cap
itals of the companies promoted by
Hooley up to 189$ aggregated sixty mil- '
lion to sixty-five million
On. Auerust 10 last application was j
made to a*Ix)ndon magistrate for "a
warrant for the arrest of Hooley on
the charge of frauulently and by false
pretenses obtaining signatures to :
checks and bills of exchange amount- '
ing to over 8650.000. The magistrate re- !
served his decision. Previously, on Au- i
gust 5, the directors of public prose- :
cutions had been instructed to inves- j
tigate some of the transactions of Hoo- j
ley in connection with a sapphire mine j
situated in Canada,
Hooley and Lawson were subsequent- !
!y brought u^i at Bow street Police â¢
Court, counsel for the prosecution, j
which is undertaken by the Public Pro- â¢
pecutor. saying the prisoners werj j
charged with defrauding A. J. Prine j
of $50,000 by selling him sharesof Si- !
berian gold mines and other worthless j
concerns. Further charges, counsel I
added, would probably follow. The j
magistrate offered to accept bail in
$60,000 each, but that of Hooley was
finally fixed at $40,000. Lawson's bail
was fixed at $50,000. with three sure
ties, who have not lÂ»Â»en found, so Law
eon remains in custody.
â¢BOSTON, May 10.â Ernest Terah j
Hooley's enterprises at one time ex- I
tended to this State. He established j
branch factories of his extensive Eng
lish bicycle manufacturing plants in â¢
Worcester County about a dozen years J
ego to supply the American trade. !
When the bicycle business was at its j
b^st Hooley's concerns were run /light !
and day. but eventually they were in- |
volved in the general collapse.
LONDON*, May 10.â Ernest Terah
Hooley, whose meteoric carper and
company promotions a few year* ag<>
astonished the financial world, was ar
rested in London to-day on a charge
of. conspiracy to defraud. Hooley's co
loFsal bankruptcy and the proceedings
j=iis:ng therefrom were the sensation
of 1S9S. Since then he has been con
nected with various promotions, some
of which led to court proceedings.
Hfnry J. Lawson. another company
promoter, was also arrested to-day in
connection with the Hooley charges.
A violent tumult among the soldiers

Loubet as a "dear son in Christ," to

"concordant integrally."

Harry Reynolds, the well-known San

the St.' Louis Police Department post

metropolis. From every big city of
the country is sent to the fair a de
tective who haB earned a reputation
for keep work in rounding iip crim
inals. Each^of . these Is paid by the
exposition company, and a close track
is kept of the men of evil deeds who
have become sufficiently proficient in
their calling to be subject to police
surveillance.* Detective Reynolds has
already been of service to the St. Louis
police, many crooks from' all over the
country being known to him. The main
body of criminals who will dishonor
the fair with their presence Is not
here yet, and San Francisco will have
a creditable lack of representation in
that line, owing to distance and ,the
fact that the greater centers of popu
lation maintain more of the class who
live by criminal methods.

ST. LOUIS. May 10.â The people of the
Â¦world, and of the Eastern States of the
American Union especially, are going
to learn before the fair at St. Louis
comes to a close' that there is such a
place an Sacramento on the map: that
it is the capital of the State of Califor
nia and a bustling, growing commer
cial city and that it is the center of a
region that for fertility and variety of
products is not equaled anywhere out
side "of California. Satisfied with her
great resources and the wealth of her
surrounding territory, Sacramento has
not heretofore pursued to any great
extent the policy of heralding to the
world the story of her own importance
and thÂ» riches that lie in all parts of
the great. valley that bears her name.
Settlers have come and a prosperous
growth has been experienced by the
city and valley, but now both are be
coming more ambitious and desire a
development greater than any hereto
fore experienced and ' commensurate
with what they have to offer to settlers.
There are thousands of acres of land j
becoming too valuable for cereal grow
ing, and the small farmer and varied
crops are needed. .
J. H. Divine and H. P. Rowley, rep
resenting the city of Sacramento at the
Worlds Fair, arrived here during the
week to co-operate v/ith Judge Wills,
Dr. Green and General Martine, who
represent the Sacramento Development
Association. All are now .energetically
at work for their section of the StatÂ».
TALKING ABOUT SACRAMENTO.
"We are for the whole State and for
the whole of the Sacramento Valley,"
said Mr. Devine, "but we are especially
going to let the world know that Sac
ramento is on the map. We have a
fine lively city that thrives and increas
es her business every year without any
particular boosting, but we want to
get all there is coming. Why, I've
met forty Eastern people here in two
days who had visited California but
had never Been Sacramento. We want
everybody who goes out there to see
the State's capital and if they knew
just what a fine city it was and what
a wonderful section surrounded it, they
wouldn't . miss going there. We will
talk to visitors to the fair and give
them literature and teach them what
a splendid home and business city we
have. ; If Sacramento can do it, she is
going to attract to herself the atten
tion that she deserves as the capital of
the State and one of the most prosper
ous cities in the United States. We
have a great future before us, but we
must cause people to come and see
what we have. Their common' sense
will.do the rest. No one can view the
riches of our section, without being im
pressed. The capital of California will
be' better known after this fair!"
M. Juwasky, a prominent merchant
of- Ventura, who has- been spending
seven months in Germany with his
daughter, passed through here last
week and visited the fair. He was
shown the Ventura display, which is
under the supervision of- George C
Dennis, a newspaper editor of that
county, and was delighted with it.
Mr. Dennis has arranged his exhibit
well and the principal feature, beans;
of which seventy-five varieties are dis
played, looms up in a manner that con
vinces visitors that Ventura cannot be
beaten in the growing of that article of
food. .. Â¦â¢'. . . .
PROMINENT PEOPLE PRESENT.
Frank II. Ames, of the Ames Mercan
tile Company oÂ£ San'. Francisco, is. here
with his wife. Charles Â«E. Benedict,
well known in Los Angeles and San
Francisco, is Introducing "a California
mineral water to the St. Louis public
and, the world, and is meeting with suc
cess. Carl E. Bundschu, son of tHe
San Francisco wine man, is also view
ing the fair.
Caiifornians here are wondering
whether San Francisco is -going to
open her building in the model city
with fitting ceremony, and are hoping
that the far Western metropolis will
give an opening that will be of benefit
to -her and the whole State as an ad
vertisement. . The other cities . having
buildings here are going to throw them
open with plenty of fanfare, accord
ing to present reports. Mayor Mc
j Clellan is scheduled to come down
when the New York structure receives
its first guests and the New Yorkers
have -, prepared for an elaborate cele
bration. Something will probabjy be
expected of San Francisco in this line
I by the fair visitors. A reception of a
| very creditable nature could be given
without great expense. Those, inter
ested in the city by the Golden Gate
are of the opinion, that money she aid
be raised to provide special features
in this building to attract visitors and
thus make the most of the opportunity
offered.

The colored delegates, through Rev.
Mr. Hammond of Tannessee, put them
selves , on record in -a- strong -protest
against the action of certain Los An
geles hotels and restaurants in refusing
to entertain colored guests. Rev. Mr.
Hammond presented a resolution con
demning the attitude of these places,
which was adopted by the conference.
The public school question was again
brought up in a resolution by Rev. W.

the General Conference petition Con
gress, and that all other Protestant de^
nominations be asked to join in the
movement, to secure the enactment of
an amendment to the constitution "for
ever prohibiting the use of the public
school fund for sectarian purposes."
"This great question depends for the
proper settlement upon the united-ef
forts of Protestantism," asserted the
speaker. .The matter was referred to
the committee on state of church.
Rev. T. B. Graham of West Virginia
desired the conference to request the
committee on episcopacy to formulate
and submit a plan by which retired
Bishops might be encouraged to con
tinue activity, giving them the right to
preside at district conferences, church
dedication ceremonies, etc. His resolu
tion went to the episcopacy committee.

COLOR ISSUE RAISED.
The Rev. Charles H. Crookshank,- M.
A., of Ireland, spoke for the Irish
Methodist church. His talk was witty
and full of point. Frequent laughter
and applause was evoked. The trials
sustained and hardships endured by the
pioneers of Methodism In Ireland were
powerfully portrayed. In contradiction
to the claim that all other denomina
tions in Ireland have lost steadily in
membership through the depleting ef
fect of emigration,. Rer. Crookshank
asserted that the Methodist church
has gained: numerically. In an elo
quent peroration he dwelt upon the
fact that Irishmen have been the fore
runners of Protestant evangelization
in nearly all the Christianized nations
of the earth. He closed with an' earn
est prayer that the .Irish- nation will
"burst the bonds of religious supersti
tion and stand forth in - the light of
the truth."

behalf of the English Methodist church.
He held the large assemblage for three
quarters of an hour with a succinct
and scholarly synopsis of Methodlstic
conditions, in England to-day. He pil
loried the prevalence ' of mystical .ten
dencies in the church abroad and drew
attention to the inclination of Metho

from materialistic tenets to idealistic

BOOK CONCERN'S REPORT
NEW YORK, May 10. â Mrs. Her
mann Oelrichs, to whom the foregoing
story was referred to-night by a re
porter, said she had heard nothing of
any such transaction. "It could not
have occurred without my knowl
edge," she said. "It is probably just
a story, such as is circulated every
little while. I know nothing that
could give rise to It.
The purchasing syndicate consists of
Rudolph Spreckels, James D. Phelan,
William A. Magee, Thomas Magee Jr.,
Frederic E. Magee and Gustay Sutro.
Mrs. Oelrichs has received the* sum of
$150,000 on the purchase money to bind
the bargain. An agreement was filed
yesterday in the Recorder's office in
this city. This pledges Mrs. Oelrichs to
give ninety days' time In which to
search the title to the various proper
ties, and the seller agrees to correct all
defects in title. If thece is any final
defect the agreement to sell and pur
chase is void only as regards such prop
erty as cannot show clear title. The
final payment of $2,450,000 is to be made
at the expiration of the period allowed
for search. This makes a cash trans
action of the great deal.
In the syndicate Rudolph Spreckels
is holder of seven-twelfths interest,
James D. Phelan three-twelfths, Gustav
Sutro and the Magee brothers each one
twelfth. No serious trouble in furnish
ing title is anticipated, as the claims
of the Nelson heirs to the estate of
Charles Fair have been finally com
promised.

OAKLAND. May 10.â -When a woman is well
gowned and conscious of looking her best, rhe
contributes very materially to the enjoyment
of any gathering of which she may "he a fac
tor, which is a plausible mason why the
Eboll luncheon to-day was an exceptionally
pleasant affair.
It was certainly a well-dressed crowd that
filltd the rose-garlanded clubroom. The Ideal
spring; day had brought out scores of white
gowns and the i>opular silk shirt waist suit
with Its 1830 yoke and full trklrt was much in

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
OAKLAND. May 10.â William Roche
McStay of Alameda Is announced .as
the winner of the coveted Cottle elocu
tion medal of St. Mary's College. This
medal, which is awarded yearly, is the
prize for elocution, for which the en
tire college competes. It Is given by
the Rev. J. E. Cottle of San Francisco,
who graduated from St. Mary's Col
lege with the class of '77, and it Is one
of the most important and most sought
after rewards offered during the col
lege year.
The . contest for this medal extends
over a period of several months. This
year it started with 171 contestants.
These were narrowed .by degrees until
the final effort was. between eight stu
dents â James Francis McCue, William

keleyHinkle. Thomas William Lundy,
Thomas % Joseph Trodden and Chris

second choice was so difficult that it
was decided to be a tie Detween Vin
cent Charles^Derham and Thomas Jos
eph Trodden. Mr. Derham chose for
his. subject Wolsey's "Soliloquy" and
Mi*. Trodden for his, "Cataline's De

the business be divided between them.
The firm has been established for
many years and conducts two places of

Equally positive are the members of
the board that Dr. Carvin has a fight
on her hands. Secretary Gere asserts
that the reason the application was
rejected was because Dr. Carvin had
b*Â«Â»n iMegraKy practicing before a li
cense had been issued to her, and that
Â«he had not asked for an examina
tion until after a warrant of arrest
had been served on her. The prosecu
tion was one of a number that have
been instijrated by the board in Oak
land.
"1 shall get a license." avowed Dr.
Carvin. with a determined set of her
mouth, "and with this acquittal I shall
bÂ« in a position to make another de
cvand for one."
Attorney S. C. Tait, representing the
board, of which Dr. Dudley Tait is
president, stood upon the proposition
that Dr. Carvin- hud failed to pro
duce the required license to practice
and had unlawfully practiced. Attor
ney E. M. Gibson, -for the pretty de
fendant, insisted that she had shown
Co intention to violate the law.
There the cane rested pending the
<late in April when the board's exam
ination should be held.
Meantime Pr. Carvin made prepara
tions to begin practice, but she swore
to-day that she had never actually fol
lowed her profession except in the
case of a Mrs. Sampson, who had se
cured from her two bottles of heart
tonic. This Mrs. Sampson, it devel
cped to-day, was a private detective
In the employ of the State Board of
Medical Examiners. But Dr. Carvin
In hrr testimony said she had been
riven to understand by Secretary Gere
that when she filed her application
there would be no further trouble. This
testimony was contradicted. At all
events. Dr. Carvin made such a dis
play Of candor concerning: her dealings
with the Board of Medical Examiners
that she won the twelve Jurvmcn and
they returned a verdict of "not guilty"

Mr. Rowe went before the Grand
Jury to-day and told them all about
his collections of mileage, and he de
manded that it call witnesses against
him in order that it might substantiate
or disprove the charge against him.
In reply to this request the Grand
Jury decided to continue its sittings
for a week longer and issue a sub
pena for Guilbault.
Upon the eve of the approaching
election nearly all of the Supervisors
have been subjected to some attack
and it is generally charged to politics
and to C. S. MacMullen. who tried to
trap the Supervisors into paying him
an abnormal commission for alleged
services in discovering unassessed
properties. MacMullen's claims were
thrown out by the board and he has
been searching county records ever
since, and in his efforts to secure re
venge he is believed to De at the bot
tom of some if not all of these at
tacks.
Briefly stated the charge against Su
pervisor Rowe Is that he has charged
mileage for obeying the summons of
the State Board of Equalization. Su
pervisor Talcott is being attacked be
cause he made some road inspections
and charged mileage therefor. Super
visor Mitchell was followed for three
weeks by a detective 'in the hopes of
discovering something. Supervisor
Kelley has been charged with putting
a heating apparatus into the Court
House in place of the antiquated sys
tem formerly in use.
All of this matter has been sifted by
the Grand Jury at different times, gen
erally upon the request of the Super
visors themselves. The source of these
attacks has not always been inquired
into. ; The report of the Grand Jury,
however, will deal with the matter as
it finds the facts.
Supervisor H. D. Rowe has deter
mined to have a complete investiga
tion into the charges of collecting il
legal mileage that have been made
against him by J. E. Guilbault.. In,.
stead of allowing Guilbault to go be
fore the Grand Jury with his charges
the Supervisor reversed the 'Â¦ usual
method of procedure and took the mat
ter before the inquisitorial body him
self. .

ADVERTISEMENTS.M. D. Hyde was recalled for further
testimony as to the Wells-Fargo en
velopes formerly in his desk, one of
which was apparently used to inclose
the anonymous letter to Secretary
Hitchcock of the Interior Department.
He denied, however, that any envelopes
just like that one were among those he
was preserving as curiosities, the latter
all having the direction for return to
sender printed on them, and thus dif
fering from that used by the anony
mous writer. The Government, however,
claims to be in possession of several
envelopes from Hyde's stock that are
exact duplicates of the one received by
Hitchcock.
The rest of the day was taken up
with minor witnesses. The hearing will
continue this morning at 10:30 o'clock,
the attorneys on each side promising
to. endeavor to close to-day.
Philip N. Ldlienthal of the Anglo-
Californian Bank said that his institu
tion acted as agent for the Seligmans
in the Aztec land deal, they sending on
the deeds for as much land as Benson
wanted at any one time and the bank
turning them over to him when he paid
down the purchase price. Benson had
not had any such sum as $60,000 on de
posit at any time during the progress
of this business.

norance whether Hyde and Benson bad
made a cent out of the transaction. He

Henry Eickhoff, attorney, testified
that Dimond came to him some weeks
after Benson's arrest for advice regard
ing the possibility of his (Dimond's) be
ing compelled to give evidence against
Hyde. At that time a portion of an
anonymous letter was read to the wit

Judge Cook yesterday afternoon dis
missed the charge of contempt against
Police Commissioner Harry W. Hut
ton, who was cited to answer for hav
ing violated an Injunction issued by
the Superior Court In Department 12
against the police force of the city.
The Injunction prohibited them from
entering or interfering with the prem
ises at 1129 Dupont street. In the same
decision Judge Cook - acquitted Police
men Keohane and Orr of having vio
lated the provisions of the injunction
by climbing over roofs and descending
into the court of the notorious resort
by means of a rope. This was on May
2 and they arrested four Inmates of the
place on misdemeanor charges. Â¦
Attorney George D. Collins, on behalf
of the applicant, Jean Pon, who osten
sibly runs a restaurant in front of the
place where women ply an illicit trade,
fought with every legal pretext to have
Police Commissioner Hutton and the
two policemen adjudged guilty of con
tempt. His contention was that the
policemen were acting under instruc
tions from Hutton, delivered to Captain
of Police Duke, and that the arrests
were unlawful because the policemen
were not armed with warrants and
that a certain period of time elapsed
between the commission of the alleged
misdemeanor and the arrest.
RESORT OF VICE.
The premises at 1129 Dupont street
are devoted to fallen women. In front
is a restaurant through which is the
entrance to the women's quarters in
the rear. Judge Cook's injunction for
bade the police to interfere in any way
with the restaurant business unless a
crime was being committed within
their view. Accordingly the police
found a window in the building at 603
Broadway, where they could view the
court in the rear of the restaurant.
They saw the inmates of the cribs ac
costing men visitors and overheard
their solicitations. Then they climbed
over the 'roof of the resort and de
scended into the court, arresting four
women on misdemeanfir charges.
Attorney Collins contended that in
asmuch as the police officers had lost
sight of the defendants during their
descent from their point of observation
they had no right to make arrests and
consequently violated the provisions
of the injunction. In support of this
contention he cited a decision of the
Xew York Court of Appeals, which co
incided with his view. Judge Cook de
clared that he did not agree with the
decision and did not consider it good
law. He held that the officers were
properly in pursuit of a crime they
had witnessed and that the fact that
they had lost sight of the criminals for
a brief time was not sufficient delay to
prevent them from being Justified in
making an arrest on a misdemeanor
charge without a warrant.
HUTTOX IS CLEARED.
As regarded Hutton there was no
testimony to show that he had In
structed Captain Duke or the police
men to violate the injunction. Duke
testified that he and Hutton had con
sidered the provisions of the injunc
tion and Instructed the officers that if
they could witness a violation of the
law they were entitled to enter the
enjoined premises and make arrests of
the violators. Even in. the event that
the policemen had infringed on the
provisions of the injunction, said Judge
Cook, it was clear from the testimony
that Hutton was not amenable, as in
such case the officers had acted be
yond instructions. The citation against
Hutton was dismissed and after Po
liceman Keohane had testified both he
and Orr were purged of contempt.
Among the witnesses during the
hearing were Police Commissioners
Drlnkhouse and Regan. Both declined
to testify regarding the instructions
and power given Hutton In the matter
on the ground that such were given
In executive session of the Board of
Police Commissioners and were privi
leged communications. Both had writ
ten statements made out by their coun
sel and Judge Cook -sustained their
contention.
Hiram Johnson, at the opening- of
the morning session, read the answer
of respondent Hutton, making specific
denials of the charges in the complaint
and then denounced the resort at 1129
Dupont street in unmeasured terms.
Attorney Collins moved to strike out
that portion of the answer as irrele
vant and Judge Cook granted the mo
tion. Johnson made an impassioned
plea for retaining In the record that
part of the answer, because, he said,
the restaurant business conducted *by
Jean Pon was notoriously a sham and
fraud and intended solely to protect
a resort that was one of the most im
moral spots in the city.
CHARGED WITH PERJURY.
During the morning session a woman
named Rosie Miller, who had been ar
rested for vagrancy by Policemen
Davids and. Barry, testified that she
had never entered the premises at 1129
Dupont street, except on the occasion
of her arrest. As soon as she reached
the corridor she was arrested for per
jury at the instance of Captain Duke
and booked at the City Prison. A writ
of habeas corpus was sued out before
Judge Cook and she was brought Into
court during the afternoon. In the
meantime the Judge had ordered her
testimony stricken out as being; not
relevant.
At the close of the contempt pro
ceedings Judge Cook ordered the re
lease of the Miller woman on her own
recognizance, because in no case could
she be convicted of perjury, as she
had not testified to any material . fact.
The contempt proceedings against
Policemen Davids and Barry, charged
with having violated the'injunction on
two occasions, will be heard on Mon
day morning next.

Schubach is a young ticket broker

For holding up a Chinese opium den
at 717 Sacramento street at 6 o'clock
yesterday morning and robbing the
proprietor and three of his white pa
trons Alexander Wheatley was ar
raigned before Judge Mogan and or
dered to appear for examination next
Monday, with ball fixed at $3000. He
was positively identified as one of two
masked men who committed the rob
bery. The other is believed to be Jack
Ramsey, and the police are on his
track. His wife, Rose, has been arrest
ed and is detained as a witness.
It was a bold crime. In the place at
the time the robbers entered were Ah
Cheng, the proprietor: William Sykes,
Harry Emridge and Edward Preston.
At the point of revolvers the quartet
v.ere commanded to throw up their
hands, and In that attitude they were
ranged against the wall and systemat
ically plundered. From Sykes one of
the robbers took $31 50. and Ah Cheng
was relieved of 60 cents. The other vic
tims decline to state -how much they
lost. After being robbed the four men
were bound with ropes and warned to
make no outcry. Then the marauders
retired. It was Sykes who first man
aged to work his hands free from their
shackles and give the alarm.
Wheatley was arrested at 21S Mont
pomery avenue by Officers Brown and
Holmes. He gave his occupation as
bartender, but the police say he Is a
professional thief. It was the descrip
tion of him furnished to the police by
Sykes that led to his arrest, and
his Identification promptly followed.
Wheatley'g mask dropped off while he
was at work, and Sykes caught a
glimpse of a peculiar facial scar before
the disguise was resumed.

Alice Evans, in whose apartment in
the Carroll House, on Sixth street,
Charles Ford waa shot in the head by
George Pearson on the night of April
19. was a reticent witness at the pre
liminary hearing of Pearson yesterday
before Judge Mogan. She swore that
Just prior to the shooting she swooned,
and was restored to consciousness by
the sound of the pistol shot, fo that
she did not see Pearson with the
weapon in his possession. Her evident
inclination to shield the defendant at
the expense of her veracity brought
sharp reproof from the bench, but she
could not be induced to alter her story.
The testimony of Ford, in whose
head the bullet still nestles, was
straightforward, and a sharp cross-ex
amination failed to shake it in any par
ticular. The case will be resumed next
Thursday.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Two 12-year-old girls. convent
pupils, were the accusers of Joachim
Thorde and their testimony prompted
Judge Mogan to increase the defend
ant's bail from $10 to $100 cash.
While they were walking on Eddy
street, near Mason, at 8:30 o'clock
Monday evening, the girls stated, they
were accosted by Thorde, who ad
dressed them with undue familiarity
and said he would like to have one of
them accompany him to the St. Louis
Exposition. When they attempted to
escape he detained them and finally
they called a policeman and had him
arrested.
Thorde's defense was that he had
been drinking and only intended to
joke. He was released from the army
on April 29. he said, and since then
has been residing at 569 eary street.
The case was continued to enable the
police to investigate the man's record.
Harry Clark, a student, stood simi
larly charged in the same court, his
accusers being two young girls, who
alleged that on Monday night while
they were returning from a theater
to their home in the Western Addi
tion the defendant followed them un
til they told Special Officer Helbush,
who arrested him at Sacramento and
Scott streets. Their testimony was
corroborated by the officer, who had
watched Clark follow the complain
ants.
The case was continued till next
Thursday for investigation of char
acter and the defendant's bail fixed
at J300.
It was a social club, with respect
ability vouched for by Chinatown's
elite, that Ah Son victimized when he
stole three opium pipes, and several
members of the organization were in
Judge Fritz's court to swear, if need
be, that no "dope" was ever smoked
under the club auspices or even with
the club's sanction. Ah Son himself
swore that his plunder was not club
property, but belonged to one of his
Innumerable cousins, who owed him
money and refused to pay. With the
club's skirts thus cleared of suspicion
of sheltering a "Joint" the remainder
of the trial was unprolific of Interest.
It was proved that Ah Son pawned the
pipes for $5 and then sold the pawn
ticket for II and he will be sentenced
to-day for petty larceny.
John Hayes, professional mendicant.
committed the indiscretion of his life
when he wandered from his usual
haunts and attempted to ply his call
ing at the main entrance to the Palace
Hotel, for Judge Mogan Is noted for
protection of the guileless tourist from
the local beggar. Six months was the
sentence promptly prescribed for
John.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Mrs. One Gogadus was given . thirty
days in the County Jail for cruelly
neglecting her five-year-old son, and
twenty-four hours In the City Prison
was the sentence received by, her hus
band, George, It having been shown
that he was out of town at the time
the babe VaÂ« left to starve by its
mother. Judge Mogan supplemented
the sentences with a scathing arraign
ment of the woman, in which he dwelt
upon the fact that drink had quenched
her natural love of offspring.
William King's morbid curiosity led
to his arrest, and Judge Fritz fined him
IS for neglecting to curb It.
While the remains il a man who
had dropped dead were lying at Third
and Mission streets awaiting transpor
tation to the Morgue the policeman In
charge was annoyed oy Mr. King's
Importuning him for permission to look
at the deceased's face, which was cot
ered with a cloth. The officer repeat
edly informed Mr. King that nobody
would be allowed to touch the corpse
until the Coroner had taken charge of
it, but while his back was momentar
ily turned Mr. King slyly removed the
cloth and peered at the dead face until
he was caught in the act. He could
not explain to the court his irresistible
yearning to gaze upon grewsome sights.
"We have already found six previous
convictions of James Turner (colored)
for vagrancy," said his Honor, "and
the clerk will continue his search of
the records until he finds ten more, for
the police say thaf the total is six
teen."
"Guess dey am right, yo* Honah,"
said James Turner (colored), "an" ef
'twill save yo' clehk enny trubble I'se
will confess to sixteen."
"Xo' trouble at all for the clerk,
James," was the cheerful response; "he
is paid for ; searching the records,
among other things. Meantime, as the
quest proceeds, you can go up to the
County Jail for thirty days, and by
that time. I guess, we will have the
count completed."
. Alexander McDonald and Patrick
Lyons were building bridges and sav
ing money in Arizona when they de
cided to take a vacation and separate
themselves from some of their hoard-
Ings in this city. When they were
arrested night before last for fighting
on Howard street they were drunk and
had about J200 apiece.
"Of course we're guilty," said Mr.
McDonald to Judge Fritz, "and I guess
we're able to pay what you're goln*
to fine us."
"I'll let you down easy," said the
Judge; "by paying $5 apiece you can
go. If you desire to do any more fight
ing hire a hall and battle where you
will not be Interrupted and put to the
inconvenience of arrest."
John Anderson, arrested for vagrancy
in Portsmouth square, bitterly in
veighed against the way in which he
was treated by the gardener of that
oasis In the north-end Sahara.
"Wese a sittin' on a bench, me an'
anudder gent." said Mr. Anderson, "not
doin' nottin* to nobuddy, but jlst dis
cussin' some perlitical matters. Wen
dis fresh guy comes along an* turns
de hose on us. Den, w'en me friend an'
me purtests, he calls de cop an' wese
pinched. I now charges him wid bat
tery."
The complainant did not deny the
hose incident, nor did the court seem to
consider it offensive.
"From your general appearance. Mr.
Anderson." the court said. "I feel jus
tified in opining that the hose-playing
did you more. good than harm. And
this opinion is formed with full appre
ciation of your aversion to water, either
as a beverage or a cleansing fluid. Five
dollars or five days."
"An* yet de parks are maintained fer
de use of de people!" indignantly ex
claimed Mr. Anderson.
"That's what." acquiesced his Honor;
"but they are not maintained as loafing
places for vagrants."
Mrs. Angelina Melanasi and Mrs.
Beatrice Sicca. with the aid of an Ital
ian interpreter, told to Judge Mogan
their respective versions of that memo
rable unpleasantness a few evenings
ago on Cortland avenue which resulted
in the arrest of Mrs. Melanasl for the
alleged brandishing of a knife and a
hatchet and the threatening to bespat
ter a sidewalk with the gore of Mrs.
Sicca. The versions were widely at va
riance, or course, as were the state
ments of eye-witnesses.
Once upon a time the Melanasis and
the Siccas were partners in the retail
fruit business at 215 and 4S0 Cortland
avenue, and when the Siccas retired
they left some of their personal prop
erty in the two stores retained by the
Melanasis. When the Siccas called at
215 they were told by Mr. Melanasi that
he knew nothing of their left-behind
belongings, and referred them for fur
ther enlightenment to Mrs. Melanasi,
who was presiding at 420. There they
were received in open hostility by Mrs.
Melanasi, who, the complainants aver,
chased them from the store by flourish
ing an ax around their heads. When
the weapon was wrested from her hand
by a gentleman who happened to be
present she seized a large and sharp
knife and hurled it at Mrs. Sicca, but
with such truly feminine aim that at
three yards' range it missed its in
tended target by about three feet and
stuck quivering in the wooden side
walk.
The defense not only denied the
hatchet and knife practice, but tried to
make It appear that Mrs. Melanasi's re-
Bort to the deadly use of those weapons
would perhaps have been justifiable,
inasmuch as Mrs. Sicca had more th^n
insinuated that Mrs. Melanasi's rela
tionship with Mr. Melanasi was not
sanctioned by either State or church.
This provocative phase was under dis
cussion when Judge Mogan abruptly
ordered a continuance of the hearing
till to-day.

Susan Dickinson, Hyde's comely
stenographer and bookkeeper, was next
called by Heney. Schlesinger objected
on the ground that any information
obtained by her from her employer was
privileged, .but he was overruled. Miss
Dickinson admitted that she had sent
affidavits and deeds to the notaries to
be completed with Jurats or acknowl
edgements-when the persons purport
ing to execute them were absent. She
had written a letter on the subject of
Schneider to Hazzard, Hyde's Tucson
attorney. She could not recall its sub
stance. It might have been something
about keeping Schneider from talking.
BARNES GOT HYDE'S MONEY.
The most important witness of the
day was James Jay Barnes, a vener
able clerk in te General Land Office
at Washington, whom Heney called
for the purpose of showing that Harlan
and Valk were not the only employes
of that great department bribed by the
alleged conspirators. Barnes said he
had been in the land office for nearly
forty years and that he had been re
ceiving money from Hyde in driblets
since 1S95.
The witness avoided direct answers
as much as possible and showed that
he felt the humiliation of his position
deeply. But it gradually came out
that the money was paid for extra
work in furnishing Hyde with advance
Information regarding State school
lands and indemnity lands, matters not
directly Included In the Indictment.
Barnes was the man to whom the now
famous "Dear Sir" letters were sent by
Hyde, who had paid him about $550 in
all, he said.
John D. Ackerman, the land and min
ing attorney, contradicted Dimond on
an important point. The defendant tes
tified that Ackerman had told him that
Hyde and Benson had divided $60,000
as their profits from the Aztec deal.
Ackerman not only denied such a state-
When the three women left the com
missioner's stuffy little room, Joseph
B. Frontin, the breezy cattleman from
Tucson, was recalled for cross-exam
ination. He started many a laugh
among the spectators by his positive
answers, but added nothing to his
previous story regarding his relations
with Defendant Joost H. Schneider
and Schneider's disclosures to him re
garding Dimond and Hyde.
Bert Schlesinger, of Hyde's counsel,
then moved to strike out all the testi
mony in the record tending to show
that Elizabeth Dimond was a myth, on
the ground that it rested on Schneider's
declarations made after he had left
Hyde's employ. Heacock denied the
motion.
Government Counsel Heney beg^.n
the day by bringing to tne stand \all
the other members of Banker Morris'
Oakland household, where Hyde's lieu
land selector, Elizabeth Dimond, waa
alleged to have been employed as a
servant at the time he was sending
documents purporting to have been
executed by her to Washington. Mrs.
Mary P. Morris, Mrs. Mary E. Morris
and Mrs. Caroline Morris Burdick, re
spectively the wife, daughter-in-law
and daughter of Henry S. Morris, who
testified on Monday, each took the
stand and gave exactly the same testi
mony the banker and his son bad
given.
They never knew a woman named
Elizabeth Dimond, but they distinctly
remembered that at some indefinite
time in the past a "girl" called Lizzie
had worked for them. They did not
remember whether she was in their
home during 1S97, when her name was
being used on the papers in Hyde's
office. They never knew of her signing
any papers. Of course, like other
"help," she had her day. off each week
and might have employed it in teal
estate transactions with their kinsman
Hyde over on this side of the bay.
They had never heard of one H. M.
Morris, who is alleged by the Govern
ment to be another of Hyde's fictitious
selectors of public lands.

The visit of King Edward and Queen
Alexandra to- Denmark recalls the fact
that in 1700 an act was passed prohib
iting the British sovereign from being
out of the three kingdoms without the
consent of Parliament. No such con
sent is now necessary. The act of 1700
was repealed In 1715. It Is noted by
the *Pall Mall Gazette that the first two
Georges were frequently out of the
country. George III was never more
than 100 miles from London. George
IV was abroad In 1821. William IV
never left the realm. In pursuance of
an old law, the King was required to
appoint a commission of the lords Jus
tices, or a guardian, to exercise royal
authority during the King's absence.
In 1845, when the late Victoria was
about to orisit Germany, the opinion of
the law officers was taken as to wheth
er the law still required the appoint
ment of a commission. The officials
decided that inasmuch as there had
been no commission since 1821, the
practice had become obsolete. "In the
debate of 1845 It was pointed out that
the great facilities for travel had re
moved the expediency of such a pro
ceeding. This, of course, is even truer
to-day."
When a King Visits.
THE grocers' convention and pure food show in this
city have drawn attention to our rivals in wine
making. Tnese rivals are not all in Europe. The
Monticello Wine Company recently held its annual meet
ing at Charlottesville, Va., and declared a nine per cent
dividend. Other Eastern wine companies seem to be
thriving, though not a grape grown in the East contains
within itself the elements necessary in Â£. sound wine.
Those wines are all stretched with cane sugar, tartaric
acid and grain alcohol. Mr. Allen, secretary of the Pure
Food Association, in his last report says that sixty per
cent ofÂ» the French still wines and eighty per cent of
French champagnes are adulterated, though the French
grape crop of the last two years has been large and na
tural wine very cheap. Much of the wines* in the sixty
per cent of adulterated product never saw a vineyard and
grape juice forms no part of their composition. The
still wines and champagnes are adulterated with new
grain alcohol and acids deleterious to health. The use
of cane sugar in French wines is encouraged by the Gov
ernment. The consumption of such sugar in the wineries
of that country amounts to 80,000,000 pounds per year.
In 1884 the French Government began a system of re
bates on sugar used in wine. The law recognizes "sue
rage" of wine. True, it pretends to prohibit their expor
tation, but examination of French wines imported to this
country proves that this prohibition is ineffective, as it
was probably intended to be.
The marketing of these mixtures, domestic and im
ported, directly affects the wines of California. The final
effect upon our vintage will be that our vintners, com
pelled to compete with these stretched wines, will begin
to stretch their own. Weak musts will be sugared, their
color brought up with drugs, and tht vinous effect forti
fied with tartaric acid, while the strength will be forti
fied by grain alcohol. If a vintner can use cane sugar in
his must he will pay Ies3 ; for grapes that show the re
quisite quantity of grape sugar in' the sacchrometcr, and

IT is reported from the California exhibit at St. Louis
that the principal business of our officials is telling
Eastern people the names of our fruits and other
products. Many varieties of our plums are not grown
nor known there. The East does not know the loquat,
kaki, pommegranate, guava, sinshiu orange, medlar nor
hundreds of our varieties of grapes.
It stares at our silk cocoons, our fiber plants and our
peculiar varieties of vegetables. It is amazed at string
beans with pods three feet lone and at cucumbers with
a longitude of two feet. In the mineral department it
is up against alabaster, mica, asbestos, rare crystals of
enormous size and rocks colored like sunrise and sunset.
The proper knowledge is put abroad Dy our exhibit.
The people will learn once for all that ro other part of
the earth produces as great a variety of the things useful
to man, and ornamental, as California. It is told that a
California girl, expatriated by an Eastern marriage, had
besought her husband in vain to visit California. She
took him to St. Louis and turned him loose in our ex
hibit, with the result that he is hurrying home to pull up
Stakes and come here. Our native daughters may do
much missionary work by going East and marrying hus
bands who can be induced to make a home in California.
We suggest that our State building at St. Louis is a good
headquarters for that kind of missionary effort. Eastern
people who go to Europe every year because they want
to spend time where the olive and the orange grow and
the sun shines warm at the winter solstice will look upon
us at St. Louis and spend their next winter here.-.
The first reports of the effect produced by our exhibit
are most satisfactory. As the season advances and our
fresh fruits are added to the exhibit in jars, the Eastern
eye will open wider and wider. It is already apparent
that California carries off the honors, in the exposition
and our people will see to it that we hold the lead we get
at the start.

Although the production of india

It is a favorite idea of many that ah
ordinary piano is quite good enough to
be worn out in practice. So it is if one
chooses that view of it. It is also true
that a really fine piano shows the ef
ftct of practice very soon, rather soon
er I think than an ordinary instrument;
the reason, however. Is entirely cred
.i table to the fine instrument, for Its
beautiful tone at first was due in part
to a fine relation between the strings
\and the hammers, and by practice the
hammers get pounded down and strike
the strings in a longer surface, which
grives rise to different harmonics. Thus
the tone gets sharp. The poor piano
had the bad harmonics all the time.
The difficulty with the view that
anything is good enough to practice
-upon is this, that the object of prac
tice is to acquire the art of producing
music, which means the art tot pro
ducing tonal Ideas and forms complete
in all their beauty. There are three
strategic points In the transaction:
First- to conceive the musical idea;
secon%. to place the fingers in the
proper places at the right time and
with the right force, and third, to
hear that the musical Ideas have been
properly expressed. It all comes back
to the ear; no 'hear, no music. This
is as eure as sure can be. Now, no
matter what the fineness of concep
tion, if the tone does not answer, the
ears cannot hear it, and as the ear is
the most central part of all in recti
fying: the practice and beautifying the
playing, it follows that those who
practice upon poor pianbs will remain
permanently deficient In hearlnir ca
pacity. This will Bhotv- in a very
marked manner in their progress in
taste, and in their being unwilling to
devote practice to tonal refinements,
in placfi of thinking only of power
und speed. Therefore It Joes make a
creat difference whether the practice
Piano making has now reached a
state of advance where any piano in
the market will sustain its warrantee,
at least the legs will not fall off, the
varnish nctf crack too soon and the
hammers and things will continue to be
operative for years. Yet in many of
them the tone will become impover
ishedâat least will become harsh and
unmusical in a very short time â a few
months at most. When this happens
the piano falls to gcive a good account
of the finer things in the music.
The prcat majority of music teachers
are unable to discriminate between
pianos of very different quality when
the makers" names Â«re concealed. This
J think, and not personal dishonesty, is
the reason why in Chicago, for Instance,
upward of CCK>0 piano pupils take their
lessons downtown Â¦upon pianos many
of which are incapable of art treatment
â i. e., incapable of the fine distinctions
belonging to the fine are of playing
choice piano music in a musical way.
Teachers who really knew these differ
ence* would be annoyed so seriously
and so hampered in their work by try
ins to force incapable instruments to
art uses beyond their capacity that
they would not lend themselves to this
very doubtful practice. They need a
Hebrew prophet to get after them, as
Elijah used to get after the weak
kneed preachers of Israel, who now and
then "bowed the knee to Baal."

Pianos ought to be sold upon the
individual merit of the Instrument, as
violins are, and not as at present by
an arbitrary scale of prices, regardless
of the merit of the individual instru
ment. Anybody can see that this
iÂ« true as soon as it is men
tioned. Yet there are difficulties in
coming round to such a state of
thinps. The piano trade is in a state
of transition. It costs quite a little
more, on the average, to sell a good
piano than it does to make it. In con-
Kfquence of this the makers of the
really superior pianos have not got
rich in proportion to their business;
several of the makers of commercial
jiianos, almost destitute of art qua.li
tfea, are far richer than the most cele
brated of the art makers. The late
J. P. Hale, in New York, got rich by
telling commercial pianos with a
profit of perhaps $10 an instrument.
He sold them by the hundred and
thousand to jobbers. AM the dealers
who handle first-class pianos make
their money by selling cheap pianos.
The first-class pianos are a good thing
to have in the store and to brag about
' in advertisements, but the money is
made on the lower priced ones.
Never until recently, and not uni
versally now, by any means, has there
been a one-price system applied to
the piano trade. To mark an instru
ment in plain figures and to take that
lirke and bo other is something which
Very few doalers have the nerve to do.

WITH the advent of the automobile there has
conie a new problem for society to deal with. It
is, moreover, a problem that grows in complex
ity with the growing use of the machine by the public
and with the rapidly increasing cheapness of its use.
Unless something be done to check a tendency which has
already gone so far as to be clearly apparent it will not
be very long before the "automobile for hire" will be a
favorite with the denizens of the tenderloin, and night
time drives taken through the park by more or less reck
less and sometimes drunken "sports" will make our
nights both hideous and dangerous, adding a new and
formidable factor to the evils of the town.
The speed and smoothness with which an automobile
can be driven over a good road and the resulting exhih
ration constitute an almost irresistible temptation to rapid
driving whenever even a seeming opportunity is offered.
The effect of that temptation was shown almost from
the very first appearance of the new vehicle as a practi
cable pleasure carriage; and while its use was still con
fined, by reason of the great expense, to a few very rich
people, it became noted as a danger on country roads
and a menace in public parks. At present the automo
bile for hire is ready for the use of almost any one who
wishes to have a frolic, and as the roads are freer for
speeding after dark than they are by day the natural con
sequence has been a rapid increase in the number of
after-dark rides and midnight misadventures.
It is quite true that many most excellent people in*
dulge in the new sensation and delight in it. It is also
true that some of those who indulge it are so very re
spectable and arc so careful of their respectability that
under no circumstances would they willingly permit it to
be known that they ever indulge. That much was shown
on a recent night when a young girl seriously hurt by the
upsetting of an automobile was abandoned on the dark
roadside by her two companions, a man and a woman,
who ran away and left her in her pain, careless of what
became of her, but very anxious that no one else should
know they had been with her for a harmless starlight
ride.
From such respectables no great harm will come to
the public. They will disturb nobody, fof they love
quiet as a clam loves it, and they will keep it as far as
possible even if like a clam they have to bury themselves
in mud to get it. There are, however, others. To some
of these others notoriety has no terrors. They are will
ing to drive their automobiles through the night at the
utmost speed careless of consequences, and as their num
bers are rapidly increasing it is inevitable we shall ere
long be confronted with an irruption of the tenderloin
into the park unless stringent means be adopted to pre
vent it.
Just how the evil can be most effectively checked is
not clear. No policeman, even^though mounted on the
fleetest of horses, could overtake and stop an automobile
driven at a rate of thirty miles or more an hour.
Mounted upon a ponderous machine moving at such a
rate, a reckless chauffeur, backed by an equally Veckless
party, would be something like a demon of the road, and
hardly anything short of a bullet could Stop him.
Whatever be the difficulties in the way of dealing with
the issue it is certain something must be done. It be
hooves all who are interested in automobiling to assist
in the solution of the problem, for the evil concerns them
more directly than any other class of people. It will be
to their advantage if the use of automobiles can be so
regulated as to admit granting to those who use it right
ly the full freedom of the main driveways. It will be to
their disadvantage, if reckless driving of the machines
and their use by fast denizens of the half world be car
ried so far that the Park Commissioners in defense of the
rights of the public be compelled to virtually close the
park against all automobiles except under severest re
strictions.
To the owners of automobiles the issue is plain and
clear. It is for them to decide whether they will incon
siderately by their example and their influence encourage
the hoodlums, or by something in the way of united ac
tion assist the park authorities in checking the evil at
once and bringing to prompt and severe punishment
every offender against the park regulations.

racking of life itself and yet the dark

him in there alone â alone with death.
Slower, slower pulses the blood in the
vein pressed tight under his sentient
thumb. Like the beat, beat of the
paddlewheels out there on that belated
bay steamer, come those twinges of
agony at the failing heart. Alone â
alone in this great city, with thousands
sleeping all about him. and yet he must,
die there in the solitude of a wilder

Three times the bell rings â three
times and there is a lightening of the
pall of darkness at the window ledge.

bounds against the burning ribs.
Oneâ Â«-two â three â who would believe
that there could come a time when
each beat would sound the promise of
life or the black puzzle of death?
Yet if the morning does come what
sign can he make so that some blessed
mortal face may look In on his agony;
voice is gone, sight is going; how to
signal the world of his helplessness?
Ah! if he could only get to the win

said that it was a good danger signal.
It must be done.

The pangs at his heart were grow

Almost all the cheap pianos fall to
"damp" easily. If you sound the same
chord several times forcibly and then
stop quickly you will hear that the tone
seems still going on. The sounding
board is not properly damped. This is
universal among the poorer instru
ments. It is a very serious defect. The
probability is that to suppress this de
fect requires some of that high-priced
personal supervision which the com
mercial piano cannot afford.
There is nothing wrong in having so
many grades of excellence In pianos.
There was a time when we did not
have them: we stopped too low down
in the scale. And I admit that any
piano almost Is better than no piano at
all. It is therefore a question of means,
tastes and careful buying. The only
thing wrong is in pretending that the
low-priced piano is excellent when it is
not, or in selling it at a price above its
class. The department stores have a ,
chance now to improve this element. Â¦
And In Chicago a modification of trade
conditions has taken place which prac
tically changes much for the better.
Almost all the really first-class pianos
(all but two or three) are now sold by
one single large house.- It is obviously
of no advantage to the house to sell to
a customer a piano of one make when
he prefers another. And he can be
given his choice, with no more than a
lair profit. >
In all piano playing of choice music
these resonances take place continually,
and the result Is to make the tone
more sympathetic. Along with what
you actually play you are blessed with
a lot of companion tones, which soften
the effect and make it more delicate
and musical. The problem Is to have
vibratory qualities of this kindâ which
never come out delicately and easily in
the poorer instruments. Here is where
the first-class pianos show their qual
ity.
If you hold the chord C-E-G in the
bass staff (C second space) and sound
the octave above, or double octave
above, the chord will answer in the
bass strings â always the treble tone,
and never the bass one. No string re
sponds to a pitch below the one sound
ed. All resonance takes place In the
unison only.
All these resonances will answer only
in the opposite direction. If you hold
silently C (middle) and sound C for
cibly two octaves or one octave below,
your treble note will sound, rather
gently, its own pitch, being awakened
by the partial tone in the C sounded.
The same bass tone will call out any
of the Gs above, a few of the Es and
generally the ninths, i. e., the Ds. The
ninth is the "gamey" element in the
tone. All good concert piano's have
this clement.
In the same way all the fifths of the
baps note will respond, if sounded for
cibly, especially the twelfth, nineteenth
and twenty-sixth of the scale of the
bass key held. The third will respond
in the seventeenth and twenty-second,
but not generally farther and not
nearer. The third resonance Is weak
anyway.
â¢ â¢ Â¦
There are two qualities in this hold
ing out of vibration which the good
piano has in the register I have men
tioned. The flfst way begins the tone
good and strtmg, and upon first hear
ing you think it holds out extremely
well; but if you listen more carefully
you will discover that the great bulk
of the tone is gone within the first two
seconds, and after that only a thin
thread of tone hclds out. If you will
try the same experiment upon a first
class grand piano you will observe a
vast difference, the fine instrument
holding cut the greater part of the vol
ume with which the tone began. Upon
the very best instruments the tone is
actually a little fuller about three sec
onds after it is sounded. The sound-
Ing board takes a little time to get to
vibrating.
The next point I would seek is the
ease and freedom of the sympathetic
resonance. All the pianos will respond
to such a very crude experiment as
that of holding a bass chordâ C-E-G â
silently below the bass staff, and
sounding with the other hand the treble
notes C-E-G above the middle C. The
bass strings will continue the chord
quite etronsly, even upon indifferent
instruments, when they are in tune.
It is not po invariable when i single
notes are sounded. When you hold a
bass key silently the string should con
tinue any treble octave which you
strike strongly and hold about a sec
ond. It will respond better if you take
the pedal about a second; then when
you Â»et off the pedal and the finger
you will hear your treble note going
on in the bass key you are holding.
You can prove it by letting up the bass
key, when the treble tone immediately
stops.
I do not undertake in this article
to make the readers expert judges of
a. good piano. I will mention, how
ever, come of the qualities to look for.
The thing which costs money in mak
ing a piano is a long vibration in tones
lying above C of the third space of the
treble. â¢ When you get above the staff
then the tone is ar>t to be too short
for singing effect. Therefore, when I
wish to examine a piano I go immedi
ately to this part of the treble and
eound one tone after another and hold
it out as long: as I can. If you go into
a selling ware room and listen you will
observe the crack salesman to attack
the piano in quick of
chords, taking an varied harmonies as
possible and an fast as at least two
chords per second. Nothing is better
calculated not to show anything about
the instrument All it shows is noise.
It demoralizes the eax to such an ex
tent that you cannot hear clearly for
several minutes, to distinguish the fine
qualities which the piano ought to
have.
piano is a fine one in good tune or a
shabby old thing, deficient in musical
qualities, often positively atrocious.
Any pinno finds friends in a family
when it Is once there. It is like a sew
ing machine; you get used to it
whether it is the best or less than the
best. You learn how to get the best
out of it if you can. It is at any rate
a good deal better than no piano.. And
one can concede this without going
so far as a certain eminent Chicago
teacher, who takes the ground that
'any piano is much too good for the
majority of people who have them."
the grape grower suffers just in proportion as the natural
elements of the grape can be replaced by sophistication.
It is also true, 'we believe, that these sophisticated
wines are easier handled and kept and marketed, than a
natural wine, so that every temptation of cupidity is
present to effect the degradation of our wine.
Mr. Bell, member of Congress from one of our wine
districts, proposed to meet the emergency by an act of
Congress imposing a tax on compound wines-. This
was met by the objection that a tax must also be put on
pure wines to meet possible constitutional^ objections.
The New York, Ohio and other Eastern winemakcrs op
posed the bill on the ground that they cannot make wine
without the use of cane sugar, and it was proposed to
compromise by an amendment permitting the use of
sugar. This means the beginning of Government au
thority for the making of compound wines and degrades
the whole industry to the French level. As for the con
stitutional objection, Congress found no difficulty in put
ting a tax on oieomargarine and other artificial butters
and compelling these to be labeled and sold for what
they are. With the grape growers of California lacking
a proper profit on their product and the pure wine mak
ers of this State suffering, it is not pleasant to, read ot
the dividends secured by the makers of sophisticated
wines in the East. It would seem that legislative wis
dom should be aimed at protecting the maker of pure
food products, and the protests of those who admit that
they make impure should have no weight. The Eastern
protesters who oppose the bill because they cannot make
wine without stretching with sugar and corn spirits
should be met by telling them that their product is not
wine at all. One of the great centers of that so-called
wine industry is at Hammondsport, N. Y., on Keuka.
Lake, using as a base the light grapes of Yates and sur
rounding counties. It is natural, therefore, that we find
the Hammondsport Herald protesting that the Bell bill
will give California winemakers a monopoly and that "it
behooves the Eastern people to get together and not
only defend their interests, but secure such favorable
legislation as the merits of their products so richly de
serve."
What the Herald really means is that the bill, in its
original form, was intended to give pure and genuine
wines a monopoly of the market for such wines. If it
be the good luck of California to be the only producer
of such wines, that is a natural advantage inhering in
our soil and climate, of which our wine growers should
have the advantage.
Already there are signs that our winemakers feel
driven to resort to the methods of their rivals. Low
grade Hawaiian sugar is available for use on pomace
which supplies the tannin. The mixture resulting is de
ficient in color and this is found in so-called "cherry
juice," an importation of which was recently refused en
try at the San Francisco Custom-house because analysis
showed it to be coal tar dye that had no acquaintance
with a cherry tree.
With foreign and Eastern competition of sugared and
compounded wines and the Mexican output increasing in
Aguas Calientes, San Luis Potosi, Zacatecas and Saltillo,
it is high time that our California winegrowers assert
their right to protection in the production and marketing
of pure, natural wines.

The charges against Lieutenant Aiken
are of a serious character, being
breach of arrest. Should he be found
guilty of this. charge there is only one
sentence to be pronounced upon him
and that is dismissal from the army.
A breach of arrest in the army is con

DR.A.LJ5IMPS0N
The Discoverer of a New
Method of Painless
Dentistry.
Dr. A. L. Simpson, who has offices at
1206 Market St., has, after two years' ex-
perimenting: and an - expense of several
hundred dollars, at last discovered a
method whereby teeth can be excavated
and filled and teeth ground for crowns,
etc., without any pain. His method In
some ways resembles Mr. Edison's meth-
od of short-circuiting the nerve, but varies
from this in that he combines electricity
and anaesthesia. The anaesthetic Is ap- ,
plied continuously by a current of com-
pressed air from the handpiece and is
carried by the electric current which
passes through the bur, thus conveying
the anaesthetic through the dentine to
the nerve and numbing or desensitizing j
It. The compressed air also keeps .the 'â¢
cavity clean so that any part of the cav-
ity can be seen at all times. In connec- Â¦
tlon with this the doctor also has all the
latest electrical apparatus, such as elec-
trie mouth lamp, electric sterilizer, an-
nealer and warm air and water.
All instruments are thoroughly steril-
ized by, new process.

HOLD SECOND DAY'S SESSION'
NEW YORK. May 10.â The grand
circuit of race tracks was organized
as a corporation at a meeting here
to-day of representatives of twelve of
the most important tracks of the coun
try. The object of the organization,
according to its secretary, Albert H.
Moon of this city, will be the "purifi
cation of the turf and the uplifting of
racing to the highest possible plane."
It will not interfere with the parent
bodies, the National and the American
Trotting associations, but will act in
harmony with them.
The twelve tracks incorporated in the
grand circuit will be Detroit, Cleve
land. Buffalo. Empire City and Brigh
ton Beach, N. Y.; Readville. Boston,
Providence, Hartford, Columbus, Ohio,
Cincinnati and Memphis.
The articles of Incorporation wer*
signed by Daniel J. Campau of Detroit.
James Butler of New York, C. K. O.
Billings of Memphis, John E. Thayer of
Boston, F. E. Perkins of Providence
and II. M. Hanna of Cleveland.
The six named were chosen as stew
ards of the grand circuit and the fol
lowing officers were elected: Daniel J.
Campau, president; John E. Thayer,
vice president; Albert H. Moon, secre
tary.
D. J. Campau, C. R. Bentley of Buf
falo and Albert H. Moon were appoint
ed a committee to draw up a consti
tution and by-laws for the organiza
tion. These will probably be similar to
those of the National and the American
Trottins associations.

PORTLAND. Or., May 10. â When
Beck failed' to hold Spencer's toss of
Eagan's bounder and Drennan mis
judged McLaughlin's swipe to center
field, which was good for two bags,
Portland lost all chance to win to
day. This was in the ninth, and one
run came in. . Castro then failed to
handle Graham's easy swat and two
more Tigers crossed the plate.
The game was full of life and bar
ring the final errors was well played.

ST. LOUIS SLUGGERS LAND
ON MATTHEWSOX'S CURVES
NEW YORK. May 10.â Despite tb.2
rain and mist which prevailed to-day,
racing: at Morris Park was of a most
spirited character, several of the events
being won by short heads, while in the
last event the keenness of the strug
gle was accentuated by the Judges
announcing a dead heat between Colon
say and Hello with The Southerner
third.
Many who wagered on Hello were
confident they would cash their bets,
for they saw Colonsay continually In
terfere with Hello for a sixteenth of a
mile. As Hello was thus forced into
The Southerner, his rider was com
pelled to pull up about eighty yards
from the finish.
Hardly had the jockeys on the three
placed horses passed the scales than
Hildebrand, who rode The Southerner,
preferred a claim of foul against both
the others. The stewards then heard
what Michaels and Phillips had to say
and in a few moments the' numbers
were taken down and Hello was an
nounced as the winner with The South
erner second and Short Hose third.
The last named probably found, the
task of conceding twenty-six pounds
to Colonsay, of the same age, too hard.
He ran fairly well for a mile.
In the fourth race, the Harlem
Stakes, with selling allowances, there
was another extremely close finish.

Oakland was nosed out at thÂ© finish
5-eeterday afternoon at Iflora Baseball
Park. Oakland. Just because Pete and
hiÂ« warriors could not eteal the seven
winks coming down on tBe train from
the wild northern region*. They were
shy Just a run and that cost them
.their position in the pennant race, for
they repoee in third place and the
Angels are e=econd. Scora 3 to 2.
"They have no cots for us," quoth
Peter, "and ho-w can you win ball
g-axnes when you hare to sleep in the
field? I could put the kids to bed
vhen they come in from the field, but
then they might dream or being beat
en, bo it would surely be off with any
thing like that going on. The best we
can do is to fight 'em to the finish and
plve the fans a gallop for their coin."
And that's the way it came to pass.
Oakland only recovered in two roundsâ
the second and the last. In the latter
It looked like an old time rapid-fire
Vindup, but Schmidt was nailed as he
tore into third base after Ganley
scored Lohman wiih a drive to the
left garden.
Schmidt teas a little wild and did not
look just right. The Angels squeezed
a run through in the third. Ross hit
to left and got to second while Kruger
â¢was making up for some of that lost
sleep on the train. Chase sacrificed
bim to third and Eagar let him ar
rive by putting a long fly out to center.
\\"hich Kruger could not return to the
plate in time.
â¢ That tied the score and kept the fans
thinking and yelling for awhile. Many
times runs were cut off by some great
work on the part of the outfielders.
The Angels came up strongly in the
eighth. Ross opened it with a clout to ;
left good for three bags. Chase hit to
Schmidt and Ross just beat the throw
to the plate. Eagar's out put Chase
up one r.otch and "Dolly" Gray's nice
wallop to left field let him in, though
Moskiman fumbled the ball.
With one gone in the ninth. Oak
land made a try at a great finish.
Devereaux worked Gray for a base and
Peter himself came up to bat for Boet
tigcr. He forced the red one at sec
ond and then Schmidt get a walk. Gan
3ey responded with his third hit for the
day and Peter hotfooted for the pan.
He arrived safely, but Schmidt was
pinched as he came sliding Into the
third bag. The score:

Notes of the Game.
G*n!ey knocked out three of the Oaklanders'
eix hit*.
â¢ Toman hurt himself eliding Into first bore in
the rlchth and retired la favor of Raymond.
Kruger saved a raft of runs for his team in
the third wh'n hÂ« grabbed Cravath's sky
*eraper with men on second and third and two
tiut
The fielding honors cf the day went to Ross.
He accepted half a dozen seemingly Impossible
-â¢ hances in left field and he also figured in nsak
'inr most of the runs.
Franckc made one of the most remarkable
play* ever seen on any diamond and It hap
jjesed to be the <*urtain raleer of the game. In
the first Inning Tcman shot the ball past third.
It was cr'.r.g out to left field when Francks
rr.aÂ£e a scoop for It aad wlnzed it over to first
in time to catch the runner. Such plays are
peen but few times In a season.
Fcfcafiy refused to wesr the regulation Oak
land black cap. He says he can't play ball un-
W* his head Is decorated with a piecÂ« of white
millinery. Strange to Â«ay he never had a
â¢ â¢nance In the field yesterday, something un
usual for a record bag*man.
The clencymen of Oakland **#m to be fans
r.f the first water. Tout of them sat In the
â¢traad stand yesterday and rooted for the home
tram to win. Each waÂ« cf a different creed,
but they ail united in pulling hard for Peter
and hi* warriors.
The double umpire eystem was tried yester
â¢<5ay and It worked well, for not a. kirk was
resi*tÂ«red during the gam*. McDonald was
not fefllnr well, so "Tip" O'Neill volunteered
to help him cut. "Tip" looked out for balls
und strikes and Jim watched the bases.
â¢Tip's" eyes werw unusually good and nothing
escaped him.
The Recreation Park management has at last
purchased the property In back of the center
licM fence and on npxt Monday the work of
â¢moving the hou*Â»>Â« and extending the center
field fence back fifty feet will be commenced.
Manager Harris has signed Heiny Ueltr,
mrtwhile king of second basemen, to play the
middle utation. Rcltz has been playing in the
Oregon "Hush League" for several weeks and
ii> reported to have kept Fober for some time
TÂ»e is signed on condition that he will not
touch a drop of liquor, ar.d half of hlÂ» salary
wfll be withheld till the end of the reason, ko
.that the temptation to ro on a spree will be
less alluring.

American Golfer Defeated.
LONDON, May 10.â In the ladies'
golf championship , contest at Troon,
Scotland, to-day Miss ;Higgins of the
Midlothian Club of Chicago, who ; drew
against the 1 international championi
Miss Rhena Adair, was defeated by
3 up, 2 to play.
Otts to right Rube Smith.
A battle that promises to be short
and to the point has been arranged for
the Reliance Club's monthly show
next Monday night. It will be be
iween Billy Otts and Rube Smith at
14 2 pounds, weigh in at 3 o'clock, and
has fight in every letter of the two
names. Good Judges say it may go
six or eight rounds, but can hardly
â¢last' longer, as each man usually winds
up with a knockout when meeting
one of hia own kind. Their styles
are similar. Ottsis a trifle more clev
rr. but Smith's ruggednes3 makes, up
for tha^ difference. The . similarity
lays inThe fact that they both bore In
and swap blows at all times and can
hit hard enough to win if they land
right Â¦ " '- v*-i
. Fred Nutting, "from Australia," laid
down to Danny Sullivan after a minute
of fighting in a scheduled ten-round go.
Jack Evans secured the decision over
Fred Turner, colored, in four rounds.
Thurston recovered in the tenth
round, but was kept in bad shape by
Mike's repeated blows to the stomach.
In the fourteenth round McClure sent
his opponent through the ropes. After
the ninth round McClure was busy at
his man's stomach, and the fight ended
with Mike hammering away.
Thurston's blows were cleaner but
proved ineffective. There was no steam
in them after the eighth round. The
only time he seemed to affect McClure
was in the third round, when a couple
of rights and lefts shook up Mike. In
the rallies McClure had the best of It,
but the stronger. On the whole the
fight was slow.
Mike McClure won a decision over
Charles Thurston in a fifteen-round
boxing bout last night at the Sequoia
Club, Oakland. McClure had his man
in dire distress in the ninth round from
a terrific stomach punch. Only the gong
saved Thurston from going out. Thurs
ton's seconds yelled "foul," but Referee
Kckhart justly refused to recognize the
claim.

his third consecutive victory at Worth
to-day when he cantered home in the
second and feature race of the day two

Johnson. Despite the fact that he ap
peared to outclass his field, he was as
good as 8 to 5 in the ring, at which
price he was heavily backed and went
to the post at 3 to 2. Van Ness jumped
to the front in the first few strides and,
with apparently no effort, went on and
with his head high in the air cantered
home the easiest kind of winner.

Mis*. Ix-ona Bonne Demands $100,000
Damages Because He Refused
to Marry Her.
Mis? Leona Bonne of Chicago avers
in a complaint filed yesterday in the
United States Circuit Court that Wil
liam L. D. Gary of Oakland owes her
J 100,0 00 damages for trifling with her
. heart and disdaining her hand after
he^ had promised to make her his wife.
:More than that, she states that when,
on February 23, JS01, in Chicago he
induced her to promise to marry him,
he was already a married man, but
falsely and fraudulently represented
to her ..that he was a bachelor.
Then she goes on to state that on
March 4, 1901, he was divorced from
his wife and since then married an
other woman, forgetful of his ante
xfivorce vows of fealty to the plaintiff.
â¢Since that event the slighted Leona
has^remained single, she says, and al
ways ready to fulfill the promise she
'made to Cary in Chicago.
. The plaintiff, who is a circus per
ff.rrrjer, first sued defendant in Chicago
and. again in Oakland, but lost in each
instance.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Alameda, which arrived yesterday
afternoon from Honolulu, bucked head
winds nearly every knot of her Journey
from the island port, but, in spite of
the heavy and continuous handicap,
kept better faith with her schedule
than do the trains running between the
Atlantic and Pacific seaboards. The
Alameda came up from Honolulu In six
days, three hours and would have
docked an hour earlier than she diJ
had the Harbor Commission dredging
department not overlooked a bank of
mud which shoaled the water on the
south side of Pacific street wharf.
The Alameda brought 1760 tons of
freight and 229 passengers. Among the
passengers were many Eastern tourists
to whom the trip on the Alameda "was
not the least enjoyable part of their
South Sea vacation.
P. S. Moore of Lancaster, Pa., said
that he bought 2500 shares at $1 25 a
share, and that when he asked Rumble
to make him a loan on the stock Rum
ble replied that he was a miner, not a
lender.
Dr. H. E. Bliler of Chicago told how
he paid Rumble for S50 shares at $1 50,
and drew $100 in dividends.
Frank T. Terry, another Easterner,
identified circulars telling of the nug
gets that were being washed out of the
Old Glory. '
Gold nuggets each weighing an ounce
and crushing down the riffles in the
sluice boxes of the Old Glory mine, in
the citrus belt of Butte County, were
the golden bait used by George W.
Rumble to sell to optimistic Easterners
dividend-bearing shares of the Sunset
Mining Company, of which Rumble
was the head and the tall. Stacks of
letters and circulars were read in the
United States District Court yesterday
by Assistant United States Attorney
Ben L. McKinley which were go full of
chunks of gold (on paper) and 24 per
cent per annum dividends that the eyes
of the twelve jurors seemed to water
at the millionaire feast.
Despite the efforts of General W. H.
H. Hart and Judge Cotton for the de
fense to have the sanguine exhibits
ruled out, Mr. McKinley and his assist
ant, Postoffice, Inspector James O'Con
nell, succeeded in proving that they had
been perjt through the mails by Rumble.
The prosecution to-day will endeavor
to show that the representations made
in the, letters and circulars were false
and fraudulent.
Several witnesses from the East were
on the stand yesterday, the most in
teresting of whom was John Bull Jr.
of Elmira, N. Y. He swore that his
firm, Smith & Bull, sold 8000 shares of
Sunset for Rumble at $2 a share, re
ceiving $1 a share, or 58000, as their
commission.
" . Juse Franca, a Portuguese jeweJer,

sireet, who. in a cross-complaint to the
.-max. for divorce brought against him
Jxy Anna Franca, preferred charges of
;i sensational nature against her, has
tailed to prove that Mrs. Franca was
â¢â¢ .*nythir.g but a dutiful wife, and a di

prourid of extreme cruelty.
Judge Troutt signed the decree yes
.' i^ttlay. The trial of the case occupied
The attention of the court for eeveral
ciays. It was a. most sensational affair,
not only because of the nature of the
â¢ h<*rges made by both litigants, but ;
because of their prominence in the
Vortu&uese colony.

PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Flammarion's treatise that is
so electrifying the world to-day. He Is no
Imitator. His work Is upon original lines,
pure thought, clear vision. He tells you what
you desire to know and works in the open
light. .. .. ?. â¢ '-
He is as conspicuous for h!Â« wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he is for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading Is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test
Is of little value; when the mind Is troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.
This is Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE
gives you when you call on him for a first-
class .clairvoyant reading.
He asks you no questions, ~ but tells you
what you wish to. know.
He does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts in your case. Let PROF. LIV-
INGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.

MANY CANDIDATES FOR
GUBERNATORIAL* HONORS
At the .conclusion of to-day's inquest
It was decided that nothing further
could be gained by holding the body
here longer, consequently the special
train which brought the brothers of
the dead man, physicians and detec
tives to the scene this afternoon- will
leave at 4 o'clock "Wednesday morning.
It was stated to-day by persons close
to the Wentz family that the question
of reward will be settled as to the
amount and time of payment after the
verdict is rendered. There is a great
difference of opinion as to the cause of
Wentz's death, whether accidental, sui
cide or murder.
BRISTOL, Va.. May 10.â The shrunk
en and decayed body of Edward L.
Wentz was literally taken to pieces this
afternoon by physicians and detectives
In the course of the Coroner's Inquest,
which was begun at i o'clock in the
dark cavern of Black Mountain and
was closed without a verdict by the
coming of night. Many now believe his
death was a case of suicide. At 7:20 the
jury adjourned until a: 30 a. m. to-mor
row, when another session will likely
be held at Big Stone Gap and many
witnesses will be heard.
A 32-caliber pistol ball was found In
the body, which might have been dis
charged from the empty pistol of the
same caliber found eighteen feet awa>
from the remains. The ball had passed
through the fifth rib, entering in front,
and had penetrated the heart. Several
holes were found in the clothing where
other bullets entered, but beneath them
the body was intact. A white pearl

TRENTON, N. J., May 10.â In the Re
publican State Convention, held here
to-day for the purpose of electing dele
gates to the national convention, the
only hitch In the programme was an
unexpected objection to the election of
the four men who had been named for
the honor. These four were Governor
Murphy, United States Senators Kean
and* Dryden and State Assessor Baird
of Camden.
William Howland of North Plainfleld
objected to Mr. Baird in behalf of his
county, Somerset, but on the roll call
Governor Murphy and Senators Kean
and Dryden received every one of the
920 votes of the convention, and Baird
received all the votes except six of the
seventeen votes that were cast by Som
erset.
The alternates at large were elected
without opposition. These were Secre
tary of State Dickinson, Senator Me-
Kee, Clarence Breckinridge and Grif
fith Lewis.
The platform adopted by the conven
tion was a strong indorsement of the
Republican National and State admin
istrations and indirectly favored the
nomination of President Roosevelt to
succeed himself, although, in keeping
with the policy that has always pre
vailed in this Sta,te, the delegates were
not instructed.
Resolutions were also adopted as
suring "W. D. Mahon, president of thÂ«
national organization of employes, who
participated In the deliberations, here
two weeks ago, of the gratitude of the
local members of the association and
thanking him for his services. i\ notner
resolution condemned the recent at
tacks made on President Cornelius and
expressing the confidence of Division
No. 5 In his integrity in following out
its wishes and instructions during tha
late trouble.
The members of the Amalgamated
Association of Street and Electric Rail
way Employes of America held a meet
ing last evening at which they fully
discussed the settlement of the recent
troubles with the United Railroads and
finally adopted the following resolu
tions calling on all members of the
organization to abide by the agreement
entered Into between the company and
Its employes:
Whereas, A satisfactory settlement has been
reached covering the hours of labor, wages and
working conditions between our organization
and the United Railway Company for the com
in* year: therefore be it
Resolved. That revision No. 205 of thÂ« Amal
gamated Street Railway Employes, in regular
meeting assembled, does hereby call upon and
Instruct all of its members to do all In their
power to carry out the spirit of this contract
and promote peace and harmony between thÂ»
company and our aMsociation by the perform
ance of their labor to the best of their ability
to the interest of the company and the wÂ»l
fare of the puhllc and thus carry out the prin
ciples of our organization, which hold that
trade union men above all others should set a
jroo<1 example as good air! faithful workmen,
performing their duties to their employers with
honor to themselves and their organization.

The reported arrival of a third car of West
ern-Poultry was an error. It has Â«iot yÂ«t ap
peared, but is reported close at hand and due
at any time. Receipts of California Poultry
were moderate and there was ; continued firm
ness In young stock, such as j Fryers, young
Roosters and large Broilers. . Old stock, par
ticularly old Hens, was weak, owing to the
abundance of carried over stock and the heavy
arrivals of Western.
Arrivals of Game were mostly in poor condi
tion, owing to the continued hot weather, and
prices were lower. Only sound stock brought

that the situation is not only unseasonable,
but that from the manufacturers' standpoint
it nan not been so bad for years. Not only
have the mills not had the usual volume of
orders, but much dissatisfaction Is reported
with the quality of the goods delivered, and
there is a possibility of cancellation.

NEW YORK, May ll>. â Only the special Â»c
tivit; of such an urually dormant stuck as
Cot.toHdated Gas saved to-day's stock market
from tho smallest aggregate of traneacHjn*
f.'r tli- >tar. On Mar< h ID. Vitttn ilÂ«> N. it -
e:-."Â» Securities decision was handed down, thtr
total sales for the day fell to 74,400 shares.
The assumption then wag that the urcertain
t--tatus< of a larc* mass of securities uy ifaso.t
of that suit was the cause of the iethnrgic
mo\ement and hopes were entertained that itt
deciHion would release the market frcn n
ftrair.t. The came delusive hope has been
entertained regarding ' successive factois rtitÂ«*
pcecd to hold speculation in check. Bur the
eoliition of iwh succeeding difficulty leaves
thi!.p> in the same rut. The last "au* to
be removed Is the completion of the j'ananin
c&nal payment, which Is now practically
achieved, although the call of 10 per cÂ«nt
of Gc\ernm<Â°nt depoelts In banks which fell
due to-day and the rurther call of 10 per cent
on June 1 are resulting operations Ircm tho
Panama payment and remain to be re:ko:ied.
Tl.! conviction i? growing, however, that the
cause of the stagnation in the stock market is
&(> 1 Â«r lying than any temporary factor and
ha*' to do with the gradual emerging of the
conditions of general contraction In business
and industry in all directions- An important
phBM of thin contraction Is the deficient wheat
crop promised The varying opinion of pros
pect* for the Remsen gas bill under consid
eration by the Governor of New York caused
the fluctuations in Consolidated aad Brooklyn
Union Gas. Some part of the present extreme
paucity of the dealings In stocks is undoubtedly
tfue to refusal of business from outside cus
tomers of a clars whose activities "have been
under reprobation of the Consolidated Stock
Exchange for several day*. The new president
of the Stock Exchange took the occasion of
his installation to-day to broadly intimate the
suspicion of the Stock Exchange authorities
of more or less Improper connection between
members and such outside sources of business,
a connection which the rules of the Stock Ex
change aim to forbid- li'Jjl â¢Â«

The Clean Way.
The amount set aside during the pres
ent fiscal year for street cleaning waa
$215,000, so it would appear that it will
cost something like' $27,000 more than
the contract cost. As the cost of equip
ment is $90,000, more, it Is hardly prob
able that the Supervisors* Finance
Committee will recommend that the
city undertake to do its own street
sweeping..
Another improvement projected by
the Board of Public Works is the re
paving of the streets surrounding the
City Hall, the cost of which is esti
mated at $30,250 by the, Bureau of En
gineering.
Continuing its crusade against con
cerns that obstruct sidewalks in the
manufacturing districts, the Board of
Public Works removed to the corpora
tion yard twenty-five pieces of timber
from in front of the Union Iron Works,
at 220 Fremont street; one boiler and
seven pieces of machinery belonging to
the Jardine Machine Works from 220
Fremont street, and one * boiler and
three .pieces of machinery from Fre
mont and Howard streets, In front of
the premises of Mclntosh & Wolpman.
The Bureau of Engineering, Depart
ment of Public Works, yesterday com
pleted its estimate of cost of the pro
posed municipal street cleaning system,
which has been under consideration by
the Board of Supervisors for some time.
Commissioner Woodward, who is in
charge of the Bureau of Engineering,
will transmit his report to the Board
of Public Works to-day. It is calcu
lated in the report that the equipment
of the proposed plant would cost $90,000,
which would purchase all the neces
sary apparatus for sweeping the streets
as they are being swept under the pres
ent specifications.
Tht> cost of maintenance of the sys
tem is figured at $242,000 yearly.

The report of the committee "on laws
took up nearly all the afternoon -ses-,
sion. The important changes adopted
were that hereafter no picnics or eri-'
tertainments in the name of the order
shall be given on Decoration day; mak
ing the election of high officers secret,
Instead of open ballot, and making the
office of permanent Secretary an elec-*
tive one.
An amendment having for its object
the prevention of "'a" retiring or' retired
high chief ranger again seeking nom
ination for that office was voted down.
The High Court will meet again this
morning. The election "for officers will
be held to-morrow.
To-night the high officers and the
delegates will, for the first time, wit
ness the* exemplification of "Through

which will be introduced In all courts.
To-morrow night the high officers and
delegates will be guests at a banquet
in .the Lick House. They will leave
the hall in a body and be escorted to
the banquet hall by the Juvenile For
esters' brass band.
After the high chief ranger had ap
pointed the standing committees he
presented his address to tne high body
which covers the work of the order
for two years past. In ihis he states
that during the early part of the term
the State of Colorado was taken from
the Pacific jurisdiction and transferred
to the Atlantic Jurisdiction, yet, not
withstanding the loss of seventeen
courts, the order initiated, during the
two years, almost as many as were
drawn away and made a gain In finance
of $12,535, the greatest ever made- in a
single term. Since the last session of
the high body twenty-five new courts
were" instituted and the membership
now is 8791. He recommends a change
of the ritual, the fixing of the per
capita tax at $1, the codifying of the
laws of the order and the enlargement
of the social feature of; the organiza
tion.
" The report of . Permanent^ Secretary,
Falconer, which. gives the condition of
the order in detail, that of HighiTreas

Several vocal and instrumental se
lections were rendered at the conclu
sion of the lecture.
John A. Hosmer of the Cymrodorion
Society of California delivered an In
teresting address last evening at Uto
pia Hall on Sutter street.
The subject for the lecture was
"The Laws of Hywel Dda/' which in
English means "The Laws of Howell
the Good." Howell was King of
Wales in the tenth century and his
life and history of good deeds were
well described by the speaker.
Hosmer said that Howell called his
noblemen together and before them
wrote the laws of the country. Three
copies of them were made. One copy
was sent to the western part of Wales,
one to the southern and the other to
the northern part. Mr. Hosmer saj's
these were the first laws of govern
ment that ruled Wales.

"feAXDSOME NEW BUILDING TO BE ERECTED FOR THE SAX FRANCISCO
I NURSERY FOR HOMELESS CHILDREN AT FOURTEENTH AVENUE AND
1 LAKE STREET, AS IT WILL LOOK WHEN COMPLETED
Promises a Rarrel Â«Â»f Fun.
This evening the members of New
Century Circle of the Companions of
the Forest of America will have an at
home entertainment and leap year
party In the social hall of the Alcazar
building, on which occasion, so the
committee announces, "there will be
a barrel of fun."
The dormitories will receive special
attention and will be . commodious
enough as to permit of ample space
between each bed. This arrangement
will apply to the boys' as well as the
girls' and babies' sleeping apartments.
The day nurseries are to have every
accommodation for the comfort of the
little ones and each boy and girl is to
be the possessor of a separate closet
wherein clothes must be neatly kept,
the idea being to place upon the shoul
ders of each child a domestic respon
sibility.
There also will be playgrounds, one
for boys, one for girla and one for in
fants, and here will the officers of the
institution take advantage to build up
for their charges a healthy and vigor
ous physique.
Among the recent donations toward
the building are 4*6,000 bricks, the gift
of Dr. J. W. Edwards. Dr. Hartland
Law and L. A. Steiger.
The women Â¦ managers find that
there is a small -sum .over . $25,000
lacking to make up the $40,000 which
is required to complete the' institu r
tion's new quarters, but under no cir
cumstances will they be deterred from
going ahead with their laudable proj
ect, even though the full sum needed
should not be at hand Immediately. Â¦
The rooms are to be so arranged
as to allow of complete light and as
perfect ventilation as human skill can
obtain.
The new building will be erected
from plans prepared, without cost to
the Institution, by Meyer & O'Brien,
architects.
With such a promise in view and
with the desire to have a commodious
and appropriate place wherein to
house and train homeless little, mites
of the city up to the standard of good
citizenship the committee in charge of
fhe project. Including Mrs. M. H.
Hecht, chairman; Mrs. J. Bertz, Mrs.
James Elder, Mrs. Herbert E. Law.
Mrs. E. F. Preston, Mrs. George Sper
ry and Mrs. William Thomas, set out
with a view to accomplish their ob
ject. To-day they are looking with
pride upon their efforts, since they
have obtained almost the sum stipu
lated by Mr. Law, which almost places
j them In possession of his generous of
!fer.
Some while ago Herbert E. Law
promised that If the directors of the
nursery could raise $10,000 he would
add to the amount $5000.
Within a month the good women
that direct the destiny of the San
Francisco Nursery for Homeless Chil
dren hope to break ground and begin
the building of the new nursery and
home on their newly acquired land at
Lake street and Fourteenth avenue.
Their hope to carry on the object
in view to a successful consummation
looks now very like being an accom
plished fact.
The subject of Introducing portable
schoolhouses was introduced by. Alfred
Roncovieri, who stated that, as the
houses cost but $550 each, considerable
money could be saved that is now be
ing expended in the renting of rooms
in different parts of town.
The meeting was adjourned without
the Supervisors having taken any defi
nite action, and will be continued to
day at 2 o'clock.
Maurice Reardon appeared before
the committee of . Supervisors to ex
plain his reaso"h for charging 90 cents
each for repairing picks that were
originally purchased for 65 cents. Rear
don said that he charged private par
ties $1 for the work, and that a pick
was no good until it had been
"steeled."
President Schmitz of the Board of
Public Works stated that he had in
vestigated, and that wholesale dealers
had all confirmed Reardon's state
ment. The question will be reported
to a committee next Monday morning.
Coroner Leland asked for $21,820 for
salaries and $4145 for expenses. He
wants provision made for an extra
deputy and an extra messenger to re
lieve the two messengers now employ
ed from working twelve hours a day.
An assistant autopsy surgeon was
also desired to assist Dr. Bacigalupi.
This matter also was taken under
advisement.
PORTABLE SCHOOLHOUSES.
The salaries paid grammar school
teachers in the past have been $50 for
the beginning, with a gradual increase
to $83, the maximum figure.
Roncovleri held that $50 is too small
a salary, as an applicant for the posi
tion of schoolteacher must have grad
uated from either a State university
or normal school, and that she must
have spent at least ten or twelve years
in her education. For that reason,
Roncovieri says, the returns for the
money she ' expended are insufficient,
and he made a motion that the mini
mum salary be raised from $50 to $60.
Roncovieri said: "Fifty dollars is
hardly a typewriter's pay, and, as we
expect our teachers to keep up a good
appearance, we should not hesitate at
the .expenditure of the $10 difference."
It was next shown by the Board oZ
Education representatives that, as the
attendance is increasing, so the num
ber of teachers must be increased.
Classes should average 41 pupils to
the teacher, and this would increase
the payroll $48,000 for regular teachers
and $23,000 for teachers who receive
from $50 to $60 salary.
The report made by the Board of
Education shows that it has $4,033,
200 now on hand, while the difference
of $966,800 Is needed for salaries alone.
The business of framing the city
budget was begun yesterday afternoon,
when the Finance Committee of the
Board of Supervisors, with H. U.
Brandenstein In the chair, met the
Board of Education.
Though several hours were taken
up by. the investigation of the figures,
the work was not completed, and the
committees will meet again at 2 o'clock
this afternoon.
Charles Berliner, financial expert for
the Board of Education, proposed that
an appropriation of $1,100,000 be turn
ed over to the board, which is an in
crease of $441,000 over last year's ap
propriation. Berliner maintains that
the increase of attendance of city
schools is 1000 per annum, and that the
present attendance is 38,000 children.
There are 1116 teachers on the pay
roll, 17 of whom are specials, 78 prin
cipals and the remaining 921 are reg
ular teachers.
SALARIES TOO LOW.
The Association of Veteran Odd Fel
lows held its annual meeting: Monday
right and after hearing the reports,
which show the institution to be in a
flourishing condition, the following
Â¦named were elected as officers for the
current term: J. F. Thompson, presi

."William H. Barnes, secretary (twenty
sixth year) ; Daniel Sewell, treasurer
. (twelfth year) ; F. J. Smithson, mar
shal; C. O. Burton, J. F. Crosett, L.
W. S. Downs and W. T. Galloway, di

Estee and Past Presidents Georgre W.
Dixon and Charles X. Fox. The speak
ers were Past Presidents L. L. Alex

Last evening the members of the as
sociation enjoyed a banquet at the
California Hotel. â¢
There was also presented the report
of the trustees of the Orphans' Home
at Gilroy. which is under the care of
the assembly. The receipts for the
home amounted during the year to
$10,038, and the expenses for conduct
ing it to S8890.
. In the evening the work of the order
â¢was exemplified before the assembly
by Oak Leaf Lodge of Santa Rosa.
Veteran Odd Fellows.
The California Assembly . of Re
bekahs. the women's branch of Odd
Fellowship, opened yesterday morn
ing in Golden Gate Hall, with Presi
dent Mrs. Alma I. Jensen in the chair.
Not one of the officers was absent and
there was present a very large dele
gation of representatives, many of
them being strangers to the assembly.
The degree was conferred <Jn man;
delegates and visitors.
The report of the president, a
lengthy one, was read and then re
ceived. This shows that the order has
263 lodges, with a membership on the
1st of January of 23,33?. The net
gain in members for the year was
1770 and the number of new lodges
Instituted six.
The report of the committee on ap
peals was presented. The Judgment of
the lodge in the case of S. A. Silbertoh
itga&F t Canay Lodge was reversed, the
Judgment was affirmed in the case of
'JL B. Matlock against Red Bluff Lodge,
awhile that of the lodge in the case of
James A. Campbell against Montezuma
XÂ«odge was reversed. In the case of J.
K. Flndlay against Santa Lucia Lodge,
which involved the right and propriety
cf lodges to appropriate moneys on cer
tain occasions, was referred to the Sov
ereign Grand Lodge. In the case of A.
G. Farnele against Orangedale Lodge,
Involving the appropriation of money
for entertainment purposes, the Judg-
Tnent was sustained.
The annual report of the trustees of
the Odd Fellows' Home was adopted.
This chows that the order has invested
in lands, improvements, fixtures and
other property at Thermalito $42,290.
The report shows that it is impossible
to secure water for the "White tract, in
Santa Clara Valley,* secured for a "home,
except at very great expense. What is
to be done with the White tract will be
fully discussed during the session.
The report of the grand master shows
that during the year eight subordinate
lodges were instituted, five were con
solidated and that the gain in member
ship was 134S, making a total of 35.3S6.
There are 364 lodges in the State. The
amount of money paid during the year,
according to the report of Grand Sec
retary Shaw, for relief and charity was
$290,199, and for current expenses $256,-
C38.
