CHAPTER XV.
WHEN JUNE CAME.
**Metlioupht I met a. damsel fair .
And tears were in her eyes;
Her heaÂ«i and arms were bare.
I heard her bursting sighs.
"I Ftopp'd and locked her in the face,
'Tv.as then f he sweetly smiled.
Her features shone with mournful grace.
Far more than Nature's child.
"With diffident and downcast eye.
In modest tones she spoke;
She wiped a tear and gave a sigh.
And then her silence broke â '
8O sang Mrs. Tanberry at the
piano, relieving the melancholy
which possessed her; but Nel
son, pausing in the hall to
listen, and exceedingly curious
concerning: the promised utterance of
the damsel fair, was to suffer disap
pointment, as the ballad was broken
off abruptly and the songstress" closed
the piano with a mc-nstrous clatter.
Little doubt may be entertained that
the noise was designed to disturb Mr.
Carewe. who sat upon the veranda con
sulting a brown Principe, and less that
the intended insult' was accomplished.
For an expression of a vindictive r.a
turo was precipitated in that quarter
so simultaneously that the bans of the
piano lid and the curse were even as
the report of a musket and the imme
diate Â» â¢ of the wc-unded.
MiÂ«. inberry at once debouched up
on the piazza, showing a vast, clouded
countenance. "And I hope to heaven
you already had a headache:" she ex
claimed.
'"The courtesy of your wish, madam,"
Carewe replied, with an angry flash of
his rye. "is only equaled by the kind
ness of heaven in answering It. I have,
in fact, a headache. I always have,
nowadays."
"That's good news," returned the lady
heartily. ,
"I thank you," retorted her host.
"Perhaps if you treated your daugh
ter with even a decent Indian's kind of
politeness, you'd enjoy Dctter healtbV'
"Ah! And in what failure to perform
rny duty toward her have I incurred
your displeasure?"
"Where is ehe ium?" exclaimed the
other excitably. "Where is she now?"
"I cannot say."
"Yes, you can, Robert Carewe!" Mrs.
Tp.nberry retorted, with a wrathful ges
ture. "You know well enough she's in
her own room, and so do I â for I tried
to frtt in to comfort her when I heard
her crying. . She's in there with the door
bolted, where you drove her!"
"I drove her!" he sneered.
'Yes. you did. and I heard you. Do
you think I couldn't hear you raging
and storming a.t her like a crazy man?
"When you get in a temper do you
drea.ni there's a soul in the neighbor
hood who doesn't know it? You're a
fool if you do, because they could have
heard you swearing down on Main
street, if they'd listened. What are you
trying to do_ to her? â break her spirit?
â or what? Because you'll' do it, or kill
her. 1 never heard anybody cry so
heart brokenly." Here 'the good wo
man's own eyes filled. "What's the use
of pretending?" Ehe went on sorrow
fully. "You haven't spoken to her kind
ly sirre you came home. Do you sup
pose I'm blind to that? You weren't a
bad husband Uo the poor child's
mother: why can't you be a good father
to her?"
"Perhaps you might begin by asking
her t<Â« be a good daughter to me."
"What has she done?" â  %
"The night before I went away -she
ran to a fire and behaved there like a
c-ommen street hoyden. The 'ladies of
the Carewe family hayo not formerly
acquired a notoriety of' that kind."
"Bah:" said Mrs. Tanberry.
"The next morning, when I taxed
her with it. she dutifully defied and in
sulted me."
"I can imagine the delicacy with
which you "taxed' her. What has that
to do with your devilish tantrums of
this afternoon, Robert Carewe?"
" I am obliged to you for the expres
sion," he returned. ' "When I came
ho:nt\ this afternoon, I found her read
ing that thing." He pointed to many
very small fragments of Mr. Cum
minps' newspaper, which were scat
tered auout tlie lawn near the veranda.
"She was out here, reading an article
â¢which I had read downtown and which
apprared In a special edition of that
rotten sheet, Bent out two hours ago."
"Well?"
"Do you know what that article was.
madam, do vou know what it was?"
Although breathing heavily, Mr.',Ca
rc?e had compelled himself to a Cer
tain outward calmness, but now, in the
uncontrollable agitation of his anger,
he sprang to his feet and struck one of
the wooden pillars of the porch a
shocking blow with the bare knuckles
of his clenched hand. "Do you know
what it was?. It was a eulogy of that
damned Vanrevel! It pretended to be
an account of the enrollment of his in
fernal company, but It was nothing
more than a glorification of that nigger
loving hound! His companyâ a lot of
sneaks, who'll run like sheep from the
first Greaser â elected him captain yes
terday, and to-day he received an ap
pcir.tment as major! It dries the blood
in my veins to think of itâ that black
dog a major! Good God! am I never to
hear the last of him? Cummings wrote
It, the fool, the lying, fawning. slobber-
Ing fool: he ought to be shot for It!
Neither he nor his paper ever enter my
doors again! And I took the dirty sheet
from her hands and tore it to pieces â "
"Yes," interposed Mrs. Tanberry, "it
looks as if you had done it with your
teeth."
"âAnd stamped it into the ground!"
"Oh, I heard you! " she said.
Carewe came close to her, and gave
her a long look from such bitter eyes
that her own fell before them. "If
you've been treacherous \o me, Jane
Tanberry," he said.' " then God punish
you! If they've metâ my daughter and
that manâ while I was away, It Is on
your head. I don't ask you. because I
believe If you knew anything you'd lie
for her sake. But I tell you that as
she read that paper, she did not hear
my step on the walk nor know that I
was there until I leaned over her
Bhoulder. And I swear that I suspect
her."
He turned and walked to the door,
while the Indomitable Mrs. Tanberry.
silenced for once, sank into the chair
he had vacated. Before he disappeared
within thjs house, he paused.
"It Mr. Vanrevel has met my daugh
ter," he said, in a thick voice, stretch
ing c-ut both hands in a strange, men
acing gesjture toward the town that lay
darkling in the growing dusk, " If he
has addressed one word to her, or so
much as allowed his eyes to rest on her
overlong, let him take care of himself!"
"Oh. Robert, Robert," Mrs. Tanberry
cried, in a frightened whisper to her
self, "all the fun and brightness went
out of the world when you came
home!"
Forjn truth, the gayety and light
heartedness which, during the great
lady's too brief reign, had seemed a vi
tal adjunct of the house, to make tho
place resound with music and laughter,
were now. departed. No more did Mrs,.
Tanberry extemporize Dan Tuckers.
mazourkas, or quadrilles in the ball
room, nor blind-man's buff in the li
brary; no more did serenaders nightly
seek the garden with instrumental
plunklngs and vocal gifts of harmony.
Even the green bronze boy of the foun
tain seemed to share the timidity of
the other youths of the town where Mr.
Carewe was concerned, for the goblet
he held aloft no longer sent a lively
stream leaping into the sunshine in
translucent gambols, but dribbled and
dripped upon him like a morbid au
tumn rain. The depression of the place
was like a drape of mourning purple;
but not that house' alone lay glum, and
there were other reasons than the re
turn of Robert Carewe why Rouen had
lost the joy and mirth that belonged to
It. Nay. the merry town had changed
beyond all credence; It was hushed like
a sick-room, and dolefully murmurous
with forebodings of farewell and sor
row.
For all the very flowers of Rouen's
youth had promised to follow - Tom
Vanrevel on the long and arduous
journey to Mexico, to march burning
miles under the tropical eun, to face
strange fevers and the guns of Santa
Anna. 'â¢ * .
Few were the houses of the more pre
tentious sort that did not mourn. In
prospect, the going of son. or brother,
or cjose friend: mothers, already wept
not In secret, fathers talked with husky
bravado;, and every one was kind to
those who were to go, speaking to them
gently and bringing them little foolish
presents. Nor could the hearts of girls
now longer mask as blocks of Ice to
the prospective conquistadores; Eu
gene Madrlllon's young brother, Jean,
after a two .years' Beatrice and Bene
dict wooing of Trixie Chenoweth (that
notable spitfire) announced his engage
ment upon the day after his enlistment,
and recounted to all who would listen
how his. termagant fell upon his neck
in tears 'when she heard v the news.
"And now 'she cries about me all the
time," finished the frank Jean blithely.
But there was little spirit for the old
merriments;, there were no more car
pet dances at the Bareaud's, no mas
querades at the Madrillons', nv picnics
In the woods nor excursions , on the
river; and no more did light feet bear
Ught hearts through the "mazes of the
intricate schottlsche," as.Wljl Gum
mings remarked In the Journal. Fan
chon, Virginia, , arid five. or 'six others,
spent their afternoons mournfully, and
yet proudly, sewing and cutting large
pieces â¢ of colored silk, fashioning a
great flag for their sweethearts and
brothers to bear southward and plant
where stood the palace of . the Monte
zumas.
That was sad work for .- Fanchon,
though it was not for her brother's sake
that she wept, since, as every one knew,
Jefferson was already so full of malaria
and quinine that the fevers of the
South and Mexico must find him in
vulnerable, and even his mother j be
lieved he. would only, thrive and grow
hearty -on his soldiering. But about
.Crailey, Fanchon had a presentiment
more vivid than any born of the natural
fears for his safety; It came to her
again and again, reappearing In her
dreams; she shivered and started often
as she worked on the flag, then bent
her fair head low over the gay sHke,
while the others glanced at her sym
pathetically. She had come to feel quite
sure that Cralley was to be shot.
"But I've dreamed itâ dreamed it six
times!" she cried, when he laughed at
her and tried to cheer her. ."And It
comes to me in the day time as though
I saw It with my eyes; the. picture ..of
you in an officer's uniform, lying on the
fresh, green grass, and a red stain just
below, the throat." â  :: ;
"That shows what dreams are made
of, dear lady," he smiled. "We'll find
little green, grass in Mexico, and I'm
only a corporal; so where's the officer's
uniform?"; ' \
Then' Fanchon wept the more, and
put ' her 'arms about ,him, while It
seemed to her; that: she "must -. cling to
him: so forever. and, thus withhold him
from fulfilling her; vision.^ahd' that the
gentle pressure of her "arms mustjsorne
how preserve him to â¢ life and |tpj hen'
"Ah, you can't go, darling,"; she sobbed,
while he petted her and tried -to soothe
her. "You can't leave me! -You belong
THE SANvFRANQSCO SUNDAY CALE.
to me! They can't, can't, can't taÂ«.e juti
away from me!" ...
-And when the flag was completed,
save for sewing the stars upon the blue
ground, she took it away from the
others and insisted upon finishing the
work herself. T.o' her own room, she
carried it. and each of the white stars
that the young men of Rouen were to
follow In the struggle that would add
so many others to the constellation was
Jeweled with her tears and kissed by
her lips as it took its place with its
brothers. Never were neater stitches
jtaken, for, with every atom of her body
yearninc to receive the shot that was
destined for Crailey, this quiet sewing
was all that she could do! She would
have followed him, to hold a parasol
over him under the dangerous sun, to
cook his meals- properly, to watch over
him with medicines and blankets and a
fan; she would have followed barefoot
and bareheaded, and yet, her heart
breaking with the crucial yearning to
mother him and protect him, this was
all that she could do for him, this srnall
stitching. at the flag he had promised
to follow. â¢ .' '
When the work was quite finished,
she went all over it- again with double
thread, not facing the superstition of
her motive, which was to safeguard her
lover; the bullet that was destined for
Crailey might, in the myriad chances,
strike the flag first and be deflected,
though never so slightly, by one of
these last stitches, and Cralley's heart
thus missed by the sanie margin.
It was at this juncture, when the
weeping of women was plentiful, when
old men pulled long faces, and the very
urchins of the street observed periods
of gravity and even silence, that a
notion entered the head of Mrs. Tan
berryâyoung Janie \ Tanberryâ to the
effect that such "things were air wrong.
She declared energetically that this was
no decent fashion of farewell; that af
ter the soldiers went away there would
be time enough to enact the girls they
left* behind them; .'andi'th'at,* until then,
the. town should be made enlivening.
So she went about preaching a revival
of cheerfulness. -â  waving v her ' Jeweled
hand merrily from the Carewe carriage
to the volunteers- she saw upon the
street,- calling out to"- them with laugh
ter and' inspiring quip;"- -everywhere

husky voice, and -leaving so much of
heartening vivacity in . her : wake that
none could fail to be convinced that she

Â£ Nor was her , vigor.: spent i In\valni * It
was decided that a ball should be given
to-the volunteers of. Rouen ; two nights
before their departure for the State
rendezvous, and it should be made the
noblest festival in Rouen's history; the
subscribers took their oath to it. They
rented the dining-room at the Rouen
Hi/use, covered the floor with smooth
cloth; and hung the walls solidly with
banners and roses, for June had come:
More, they ran a red carpet across the
sidewalk (which was perfectly dry and
clean) almost to the* other side of the
street; they imported two extra fiddles
and a clarionet to enlarge the orches
tra; and they commanded â¢ a supper
such as a hungry man beholds in a
dream. ~\~- "
Miss Betty laid out ' her prettiest
dress that evening, and Mrs. Tanberry
came ; in and worshiped it as it rested,
like foam of lavender and white and
gray, 5 upon the bed, beside the snowy
gloves with their tiny, stiff lace gaunt
lets, while two small white sandal
slippers, with jeweled buckles where
the straps crossed each other, were be
ing fastened upon Miss . Betty's silken
feet by the vain and gloating Mamie.
"It's a wicked cruelty, Princess!" ex
claimed Mrs. Tanberry. "We .; want to
cheer the poor fellows and help them to
be gay, and here do you deliberately
plan to make them, sick at the thought
of leaving the place'that holds you!
Or have you discovered that there's one
poor vagabond of the band getting off
without having, hia^ heart broken, and
made up your mind.to do it for him to
night?" V '. â¢ . .
"Is father to go with us?".: asked
Betty. It was through' Mrs. Tanberry
that she now derived all- information

"No, we are to .meet him '. there. He

evening," remarked Mrs. Tanberry.

"Den we mus' git ready to share big

tried : two j others, abused J each j roundly,
dismissed her/ almost weeping hand-
maiden abruptly, and again put on the
first. Sitting down to the mirror, she
spent a full hour over the arrangement,
of her hair, looking attentively at her
image, sometimes with the beginning
of doubtful approval, often angrily,
and. now and then, beseechingly,. Im
ploring it to be lovely.
When Mrs. Tanberry came In to tell
her that Nelson was at the block with
the carriage, Miss Betty did not turn,
and the elder lady stopped on the thres
hold and gave a quick, asthmatic gasp
of delight For the picture she saw
was. without a doubt in the world,
what she proclaimed it. a moment later,
ravishlngly pretty; the girlish little
pink and white room with all Its dainty
settings for a background, lit by the
dozen candles in their sconces and half
as many slender silver candle-sticks,
and, seated before the twinkling mir
ror, the beautiful. Miss Carewe, In her
gown of lace and flounces that were
crisp, yet soft,. her rope of pearls, her
white sandals, and all the glory of her
youth. She had wound a wreath of
white roses . Into her hair, her cheeks
were flushed, and her eyes warm and
glowing, yet inscrutable in their long
gaze Into the mirror.
"Oh," said Mrs. Tanberry, "you make
me long to.be a man! I'd pick you up
and run to the north pole, where no
one could ever follow. And I can tell
you that it hurts not to throw my arms
round" you and kiss you; but you're so
exquisite I don't want to touch you!"
In answer. Miss Betty ran to her and
kissed her rapturously on both cheeks.
"Am I â after all?" she cried. "Am I?
Is it? Will the roses do?" And without
heeding her companion's staccatocs of
approval she went rapidly to the open
bureau, snatched up a double handful
of ribbons and furbelows, and dashed
out of the room In search, of the dis
graced Mamie. She found her seated
on the kitchen door steps in lonely
lamentation, and showered the gifts
Into her lap, while the vain one shrieked
Inimitably with pride in the sudden

"Here, and here, and here," said Miss
Betty in a breath, hurling the fineries
upon her. "I'm an evil-tongued shrew,
Mamie, and these aren't to make up
for the pain I gave you. but just to

CHAPTEÂ±R XVL
"THOSE . ENDEARING YOUNG
CHARMS."
It Is a matter not of notoriety but of
the. happiest celebrity that Mrs. Tan
berry danced that night; and not. only
that she danced, but that she waltzed.
To the lot of Topplngham Marsh
(whom she pronounced the most wheed
ling vagabond, next to Cralley Gray, of
her acquaintance) It fell to persuade
her; and, after walking a quadrille with
the elder Chenoweth, she waltzed with
Tappingham^ More extraordinary to
relate, she danced down both her part
ner and *he music Thereupon did Mr.
-Bareaud, stung with envy, dare emu
.latlon and essay a schottische -with
Miss . Trixle Chenoweth performing
' marvelously well for many delectable
turns before he unfortunately fell
down. It was a night when a sculp-
tured god would have danced on his
pedestal; June, but not over- warm,
balm In the* air and rose leaves on the
breeze; and even Minerva's great heels
might have marked thw.tlme that or
chestra kept. Be sure they waltzed
again to "Those Endearing Young
Charms."
"Oh. the heart that has truly loved never
forgets.
But an truly loves on to the close:
As the sunflower turns on her god when
he seta
The same look that she save when he
rose."
Three of the volunteers were re
splendent in their regimentals; Mr.
Marsh (who had been elected captain of
the new company to succeed Vanrev
el). and Will Cumming3 and Jean Ma
drillon, the lieutenants. This glory was
confined to the officers, who had or
dered their uniforms at home, for the
privates and non-commissioned officers
were to receive theirs at the State ren
dezvous. However, although this gala
adornment was limited to the three
gentlemen mentioned, their appearance
added "an indescribable air of splendor
and pathos. to the occasion." to quote
Mr. Cummings once more. A fourth
citizen. of the town who might have
seized upon this opportunity to display
himself as- a soldier neglected to take
advantage of it. and stole in quietly,
toward the last, in his ordinary attire,
leaving the major's uniform folded on
a chair In his own room. The flag was
to be presented to the volunteers at the
close of the evening, and Tom came for
thatâ so he claimed to his accusing
soul.
He entered unobserved and made his
way, keeping close to the wall, to where
Mrs. Bareaiid sat. taking a chair at her
side; but Robert Carewe, glancing
thither by chance, saw him. and
changed countenance for an Instant.
Mr. Carewe composed his features
swiftly, excused himself with elaborate
courtesy from Miss Chenoweth. with
whom he was talking, and crossed the
room to a corner near his enemy.
Presently, as the music ceased, the vol
unteers were bidden to come forward,
whereupon Tom left Mrs. Bareaud and
began to work his way down the room-
Groups were forming and breaking up
in the general movement of the crowd,
and the dissolving of one brought him
face *Â»to face with Elizabeth Carewe,
who was moving slowly in the opposite
direction, a small flock of suitors in her
train.
The confrontation came so suddenly
and so unexpectedly that, before either
was aware, they looked squarely Into
each other's eyes, full and straight, and
both stopped instantly as though trans
fixed, .Miss Betty leaving a sentence
forever half complete. There was a
fierce, short vocal sound from the
crowd behind Vanrevel; but no one no
ticed Mr. Carewe: and then Tom bowed
gravely, as In apology for blocking the
way, and passed on.
Miss Betty began to talk again, much
at random, with a vivacity too greatly
exaggerated to be genuine, while the
high color went from her cheeka and
left her pale. Nothing could . have en
raged her more, with herself than the
consciousness, now suddenly strong
â within her, that the encounter had a
perceptible effect upon her. "What pow
er had this man to make her manner
strained and mechanical? What right
had his eyes always to stir her as they
did? It was not he for whom she had
spent an hour over her hair; not he for
whom she had driven her^poor hand
maiden away in. tears; that -was for
one who bad not come, one great In
heart and goodness*, one of a pure and
sacrificial life who deserved all she
could give, and for whose sake she had
honored herself in trying to look as
pretty as she sould. He had not come;
and that hurt her. a little, but sho felt
his generosity, believing: that his motive
was to spare her, since she could not
speak to him In Mr. Carewe's presence
without open and public rupture with
her father. Well, she was almost
ready for that, seeing how little of a
father hers was! Ah! that other should
have come, if only to stand between her
and this tall hypocrite whose dark
glance had such strength to disturb her.
What lies that gaze contained, all In thÂ«
one flash â the strange pretense of com
prehending her gently but completely;
a sad compassion, too, and with It a
look tff farewell, seeming to say: "Once
more I have come for thisâ and just.
â¢Good-by I' " For she knew that he was
going with the others, gotnr perhaps
forever, only the day after to-morrowâ
then she would see him no more and be
free of him. Let the day after to-mor
row come soon! Miss Betty hated her
self for understanding the adieu, and
hated herself more- because she could
not be sure that, in the startled mo
ment of meeting before she collected
herself, she had let it go unanswered.
She had done more than that; with
out knowing It she had bent her head
to his bow, and Mr. Carewe had seea
both the salutation and the look.
The young men were gathered near
the orchestra, and, to the hilarious
strains of "Yankee Doodle." the flag
they were to receive by the sisters and
sweethearts who had made it, all of
whom were there, except Fanchon Ba
reaud. Cralley had persuaded .her to
surrender the. flag for the sake' of
spending this eveningâ next to his last
in Rouenâ at home alone with him.
The elder Chenoweth made the speech
of presentation, that is, he made part
of it before he broke down, for his son
stood in the ranks of the devoted band.
Until 'this incident occurred, all had
gone trippingly, for every one had tried
to put the day after to-morrow from
his mlnd. v Perhaps there might not
have been so many tears even now,
if the youns men had not stood to
gether scr smilingly to receive their gift;
it was seeing them so gay and confi
dent, so strong in their youth and so
unselfish of purpose: it was thl3. and
the feeling that all of them must suffer
and some of them die before they came
back. So that when Mr. Chenoweth.
choking In his loftiest flight, came to a
full stop, and without -disguise buried
his face in his handkerchief, Mrs. Tan
berry, the apostle of gayety. openly
sobbed. Chenoweth, without more ado.
carried the flag over to Tappingham
Marsh, whom Vanrevel directed to re
ceive'it, and Tappingham thanked the
donors without many words, because
there "were- not then many at his com
mand.
Miss Care we had been chosen to sins
"The Star-Spangled Banner." and she
stepped out a little from the crowd to
face the youns man, as the orchestra
sounded the first chord. She sang In a
full, clear voice, but when the volun
teers saw that, as she sang, the tears
were streaming down her cheeks in
spite of the brave voice, they be;an toCooks vlth the others. If Miss Betty
Caretve found them worth weeping for.
â¢Iiey could afford to cry a little for
themselves. Yet they joined the chorus
iKJbly. and raised the roof with the
''â¢"-gins sons, sending tho flamboyant,
proud old words thunderously to
heavca;
.. nÂ£t wag net the last song of the
night! General Trumble.ai-.d Mr. Chen
Â«n\clh had invited their young fricnd3
Lv attend, after the ball, a collation
v.hich they chose to call a supper, but
which, to accord with the hour, might
more aptly have been designated a
breakfast. To afford a private retreat
for the sc:cr.<? of this celebration, they
had borrowed the offices of Gray &
Vr.nrevel. and Orailey hospitably an
nounced that any guest was welcome to
ztAy fc-r a year or two, since, probably,
neither of the firm would have need of
for at least that length of
lime. Nine men gathered about the ta
ble which replaced Tom's workaday
old acsk: the two Chenoweths. Eugene
MadrilJon, Harsh, Jefferson Baieaud,
the stout srcncral, Tom Vanrevel, Cral
ley and Will Cummings, the editor,
coming in a little late, but rubbing his
hsnds cheerfully over v.hat he declared
vc.s tu be the last column from his pen
to rear its length on the Journal's front
page for many a long dayâ a descrip
tion of the presentation of the flag, a
bit of prose which he considered almost
equal to his report or the warehouse
fire.
This convivial party made merry and
tried to forget that most of them had
"been mighty tcary;" as Marsh said,
an hour earlier; while Chenoweth
sat with his hand on his son's shoulder,
unconsciously most of the time, apolo
getically removing it when he observed
it. Marij' were the witticisms concern
ing the diflercr.ee in rank henceforth to
be observed between the young men, aa
Tom was now a major. Marsh a cap
tain. Will Cummings a second lieuten
ant. 2nd the rest mere privates, ex
cept Crailey, who was a corporal.
Nevertheless, though the board was
festive, it was somewhat subdued and
absent until they came to the toasts.
It was Tappingham who proposed to
Miss Betty Carewe. "I know Tom Van
revel will understand â nay, I know he's
man enough to join us," said Marsh as
lie rose. "Why shouldn't I say that we
niay hail ourselves as patriots, indeed,
since at the call of our countfy we de
part from the town which is this lady's
home, and at the trumpet's sound re
sign the gracious blessing of seeing her
day by day; and why shouldn't we ad
mit loyally and openly that it is her
image alone which shines in the hearts
of most of us here?'*
And no man arose to contradict that
Ej'^-ech. which appears to have rung
ti ue, seeing that four of those present
had proposed to her (again) sthat same
-Evening.
"So I give you," cried Tappingham,
gallantly, "the health of Miss Betty
Carewe, the loveliest rose of our bou
uuet! May she remember us when wo
come home!"
They rose and drank it with a shout.
Put Tom Vanrevel, not setting down
his cup. went to the window and threv/
wide the shutters, letting in a ruddy
shaft of the morning sun, so that as he
stood in the strong glow he looked like
a man carved out of red gold. He lifted
his glass, not toward the table and his
companions, while they stared at him,
surprised, but toward the locusts of
Carewe Street.
"To Miss Betty Carewe," he said,
"the finest flower of them all! May she
remember those who never come
home!"
And without pausing he lifted his rich
barytone in an old song that had beeu
vastly popular with the young men of
Rcuen ever since the night of Miss Bet
ty's dsbut; they had hummed It as they
went about their dally work, they had
whistled it on the streets, they had
drifted Into dreams at night with the
sound of It still chiming in their ears,
and now, with one accord, as they
stood grathered tog-ether for the last
time in Rouen they Joined Tom Van
revel and sans it again. And the eyes
of Cralley Gray rested very gently upon
his best friend as they sang:
*9c!!Â«t* me. If Â«I1 ihoee endearinÂ» youn*

CHAPTER XVIL
THE PRICE OF SILENCE.
It was the misfortune of Mr. Cuni
xnlnrs* final literary offering to annoy
one of the editor's friends. The Jour
nal was brought to the new corporal
at roon, while he was considering
â¢whether he should rise from his couch
or sleep another hour. Reclining among
his pillows, he, glanced through Cum
mings' description with the subdued
giggle he always had for the good Wil
liam's style, but as his eye fell upon
one paragraph he started, Eat upright,
and proceeded to read the passage sev
eral time3 with anxious attention.
"Only two or three sources of regret
occurred to mar the delight (in which
young and old participated) of that
festal and dazzling scene. One was
the absence of Miss Fanchon Bareaud,
one of the donors: another, that of
Corporal Gray; a third was the exces
eive- modesty of Major Vanrevel, who,
although present at the time, refused
to receive the ladies' sumptuous offer
ing and insisted that Captain Marsh
v.n3 the proper person to do the hon
ors, to which the latter reluctantly,'
though gracefully, consented. Also we
were sorry that the Major appeared
in citizen's dress, as all were anxious
to witness him in his uniform. How
ever, in our humble Judgment, he will
be compelled by etiquette to don it this
afternoon to receive the officers of the
regular army, who will arrive by the
stage about 5 o'clock, it is expected,
to inspect the company and swear them
into the service of the Federal Govern
ment at the courthouse. We, for one.
have little doubt that, owing to the
Major's well known telent in matters .
of apparel, his appearance will far
eclipse in brilliancy that of his fellow
officers." -
Cralley dressed slowly, returning to
the paper now and then with a per
turbed countenance. How would Miss
Betty explain this paragraph to her-
self, and how account for the fact that
she had not seen Crailey, how for the
fact that she had seen Tom? It seemed
unlikely that she could have overlooked
the latter; Tom was one of tnose whom
everybody saw, wherever he went. And
what inquiries would she make? For
Crailey had no means of knowing that
she would not see the Journal. To
morrow he would be gone, it would
be all over, but he wanted this last
day to run smoothly. What wild hopes
he had of things that should happen
when they all came marching home
no one can say; even if it were not to
be doubted that Crailey ever enter
tained hopes of any kind whatever,
since to hope is to bestow thought upon
the future.
But. however affairs ran with him
so far as hope was concerned, he sel
dom lacked an idea; and one came to
him presently, a notion that put the
frown to rout and broughi, the old smile
to his lips, his smile ot the world-worn
and tolerant prelate. He flicked the
paper lightly from him, and it sped
across the room like a big bird in awk
ward flight. For he knew how to pre
serve his last day as he wished and to
make all smooth.
He finished hig toilet with particular
care, took a flower from a vase on
his table, placed it in his coat, and went
down to the dusty street, where
everything was warm and bright with
summer. It was joy to be alive; there
was wine enough in the air, and
Crailey made up his mind not to take
a drink that day â the last day! The
last day! The three words kept ring
ing, through his head like a- minor
phrase from a song. To-morrow, at
noon, they would be churning down
the river, and this was the last day â
the last day!
"Still not too late to make another
friend at home," he said, stopping to
pat the head of. a mangy street cur
that came j crouching and wobbling
toward hifn like a staveless little keg
worried by scurries of wind. Dogs and
children always fell in love with
Crailey at first sight, and he never
failed to" receive them in the spirit of
their approach. Now the mongrel, at
hi3 touch, immediately turned himself
over and lay upon the pavement with
all pav.s in the air, to say: "Great
lord, magnificent In the graciousness
which deigns to cast a glimpse upon
this abject cluster of ribs, I perceive
that your heart Is too gentle to kick
me In my present helplessness; yet do
with me as you will."
"I doubt If you've breakfasted,
brother," Cralley responded aloud,
rubbing the dog's head softly with the
tip of his boot. "Will you share the
meager fare of one who Is a poet,
should be a lawyer, but Is about to be
come a soldier? Eh, but a corporal!
Ri3e, my friend. Up! and be in your
own small self a whole corporal's
guard! And if your corporal doesn't
come home from the wars, perhaps
you'll remember him kindly? Think?"
He made a vivacious gesture, the
email animal sprang Into the air, con
voluted with gratitude and new love,
while Crailey, laughing "softly, led , the
way. to the hotel. There, while he ate
sparsely himself, he provided munifi
cently for his new acquaintance, and
recommended him, with an acompani
rnent of silver, to the rood offices of
the Rouen House kitchen. After that,
out Into the sunshine again he went,
with elastic step, and a merry word
and a laugh for every one he me* At
the old English gardener's he bought
four or five bouquets and carried .them
on a round of visits of? fare
well to as many old ladies who
had been kind to him. This
done, leaving" his laughter and \ his
flowers behind him, he went to Fun
chon and spent part of the afternoon
bringing forth cunning arguments
cheerily, to prove to her that General
Taylor would be in the Mexican capi
tal before the volunteers reached New
Orleans, and urging upon her his be
lief that they would all be back in
Rouen before the summer wiis gone.
But Fanchon could only sob und
whisper, "Hush, hush!" in the dim
room where they sat, the windows
darkened so that, after he had gone,
he should not remember how red her
eyes were, and the purple depths un
der them, and thus forget how^pretly
she had been at her best. After a
time, finding that the more he tried
to cheer her, the more brokenly she
wept, he grew silent, only stroking her
head, while the summer sounds came
in through the window; the mill whir
of locusts, the small monotone of dis
tant farm bells, the laughter of chil
dren in the street, and the gay arias
of a mocking bird swinging in the
open window of the next house. So
they sat together through the long,
still afternoon of the last day.
No one in Rouen found that after
noon particularly enlivening. Even
Mrs. Tanberry gave,, way to the com
mon depression, and, once more, her
doctrine of cheerfulness relegated to*
the ghostly ranks of the purely theo
retical, she bowed under the burden
of her woe so far as to sing "Me
lhought I Met a Damsel Fair" (her of
the bursting sighs) at the piano.
Whenever sadness lay upon her soul
she had acquired the habit of resort
ing to this unhappy ballad; to-day she
sang it four times. Mr. Carewe was
not at home, and had announced that
though he intended to honor the even
ing meal' with . his attendance, he
should be away for the evening itself;
as comment upon which statement
Mrs. Tanberry had offeted ambiguous
ly the one word, "Amen!" He was
stung to no reply and she had noted
the circumstances as unusual, and also
that he had appeared to labor with
the suppression of a keen excitement,
which made him anxious to escape from
her sharp' little eyes; an agitation for
which she easily accounted when she
recalled that he had seen Vanrevel on
the previous evening, Mr. Carewe had
kept his promise to preserve the peace,
as he always kept it when the two met
on neutral ground, but she had ob
served that his face showed a kind of
hard-leashed Violence whenever he had
been forced to breathe the air of the
same room with his enemy, .and that
the thing grew on him.
Miss Betty exhibited not precisely a
burning interest In the adventure of
the Damsel Fair, wandering out of the
room during the second rendition,'wan

minutes tc-oCtlier. Often she sank into
is. chair with an air of languor and
'weariness, only to start immediately
out of it and seek some other part of
the house, or to go and pace the gar
den. Here in the air heavy with- roses
and tremulous with June, as she walked
rapidly up and down, late in the after
noon, at the time whe,n the far-away
farm-bells were calling men from the
fields to supper, the climax oÂ£ her rest
lesness came. That anguish and des
peration, so old in her sex, the rebellion
against the law that inaction must be
her part, had fallen upon her for the
first time. She came to an abrupt
stop and struck hsr hands together de
spairingly, and spoke aloud.
"What shall I do! What shall I do!"
"Ma'am?" asked a surprired voice,
just behind her.
She wheeled quickly about, to behold
a shock-headed urchin vt ten in the
path near the little clearing. He was
raj;ged, tanned, dusty, neither shoes
nor coat trammeling his independence:
and Fie had evidently entered the gar
den through the gap in the hedge. .
"I thought'you spoke to me?" he said
inquiringly.
"I didn't see you," she returned.
"What i3 it?" .
"You Miss Carewe?" he asked; but
before she could answer he said reas
suringly, "Why, of course you are!
I remember you perfectly, no.' I git
the light : on . you, so to speak. Don't
you remember me?"
VNo, I don't think I do.".
"Lord!" 'he responded, wonderingly.
"I was one of the boys with you on
them boxes the night of your /pa's
fire!" Mingled with the surprise in his
tone was a respectful, unction which
intimated how greatly he honored her
father for having been the owner of so
satisfactory a conflagration. .
"Were you? Perhaps I'll remember
you if you give me time."
But at this point ' the youth recalled
the fact that he had an errand to dis
charge, and, assuming an expression of
businesslike haste N too pressing to per
mit farther parl^", sought in his
,pockct and produced a scaled envelope,
with which he advanced upon her.
"Here. There's an answer. He told
me not to tell anybody who sent it,
and not to give it to nobody on earth
but you, and now to slip jn through the
hedge and try and find you" in the gar
den, when nobody was lookln", and he
give a "pencil for you to answer on the
back -of it, and a dollar." "y
Miss Betty took the note, glancing
once over, her shoulder at the house, but
Mrs. Tanberry was still occupied with
the: Maiden, . and no one" was . in sight.
She read the message hastily.
"I have obeyed you, and shall al
,ways.- You have ; not sent for me.'Per
haps that was because , there .was no
time when you thought it safe. Per
haps you have still felt there â  would be
a loss of dignity. â % Does: :\ that -.weigh

you can, that you have it in your heart

more, without good-byâ for the last
time. Or was it untrue that you wrote
me what you did? Was that dear let
ter but a fairy dream of .mine? Ah,
will "you see me again, this once â this
once â let me look at you, let me talk
with you, hear your^voice? The last
There was no signature.
Miss Betty quickly wrote four lines
upon the same sheet: "Yesâ yes! I
must see you, must talk with you be
fore you go. Come at dusk. The gar
denânear the gap in the hedge. It will
be safe\fof a little while. He will not
be here." She replaced the paper in its
envelope, drew a line through her own
name on the letter and wrote "Mr. Van
revel" underneath, fsip
"Do you knov/ the gentleman who
sent you?" she asked.
"No'm; but ha'll be vÂ»aitin' at his
office, 'Gray -and Vanrevel,' on Main
street, for the answer." , â / .
"Then hurry!" said Betty.
He needed no second bidding, but.
with wings en his bare heels, made off
through the gap in the hedge. At the
corner of the street he encountered an
adventure, a gentleman's legs and a
heavy, hand at the same time. , The
hand fell on his shoulder, arresting his
scamper with' a vicious" jerk; and the
boy, was too awed to attempt an escape,
for he knew his captor well by sight,
although never 'before had he found
himself so directly in the company of
Rouen's richest citizen. The note
dropped from the trembling fingers, yet
those fingers did not shake as did the
man's when, like a flash, Carewe seized
upon the missive with his disengaged
hand and saw what two names were on
the envelope.
"You were stealing, were you!" ' he
cried, savagely. "I saw you sneak
through my hedge!" â¢
"I didn't, either!"
Mr. Carewe ground his teeth. "What
were you doing there?"
. "Nothing!"
- "Nothing!" mocked Carewe. "Noth
ing! You didn't carry this to the young
lady in there and get her answer?" ~,
"NoT sir!" answered the captive,
earnestly. "Cross ray heart I didn't. I
found it!"
Slowly^ the corrugations; ,of anger
wore leveled from the magnate's face,
the white heat cooled, and the prisoner
marveled to find himself in the pres
ence of an urbane gentleman whose
placidity made the scene of a moment
ago appear some trldfc of distorted vis-
Ion. And yet, curious to behold, Mr.
' Carewe's fingers . shook even more . vio
lently than before, as he released the
boy's shouider and -gave him, a friendly
tap 'â ] on the , head, at ." the same ' time
smiling benevolently.
"There, â  there.'V he , said,' bestowing a
wink upon the youngster. ; 'It's ' all
; right;* it doesn't matterâ only I think I
see'the chance. of a' jest? iritthis. â¢ You
wait, while'I read this little note, this
â  message that you found!" He ended by
winking again :with the friendliest
drollery,. -^
fle turned his back to the boy, and
opened the note; continuing to stand In
that position while he read the two
messages. It struck the messenger that
after this there need be no great
shame in his own lack of this much
vaunted art of reading, since it took
so famous a man as Mr. Carewe such
a length of time to peruse a little note.
But perhaps the great gentleman was
ill. for it appeared to the boy that he
lurched several times, once so far that
he would have gone over if he had not
saved himself by a lucky stagger. And
once, except for the fact that the face
that had turned away had worn an ex
pression of such genial humor, the boy
would have believed that from it issued
a sound like the. gnashing of teeth.
But when it was turned to .him again,
it bore the same amiable jocosity of
mouth and eye. and nothing seemed to
be the matter, except that those fin
gers still shook so wildly, too wildly,
indeed, to restore the note to its en
velope.
"There," said Mr. Carewe. "put it
back, laddie, put it back yourself. Take
it to the gentleman who sent you. 'I
see he's even disguised his hand a
trifle â ha! ha!â and I suppose he may
not have expected the young lady to
write his name quite so boldly on the
envelope! What do you suppose?"
"I dfknow," returned the boy. "I
reckon I don't hardly understand."
"No, of course not," said Mr. Carewe,
laughing rather madly. "Ha, ha, ha!
Of course you wouldn't. And how
much did he give you?"
"Yay!" cried the other. Joyously.
"Didn't he go and hand me a dollar!"
"How much will you take riot to tell
him that I stopped you and read it;
how much not to speak of me at all?"
"What?"
"It's a. foolish kind of joke, nothing
more. I'll give you five dollars never
to tell any one that you saw me to
day." , '. ]'-
"Don't shoot. Colonel," exclaimed the
youth, with a riotous fling of bare feet
in the air, "I'll come down!"
"You'll do it?"
"Five!" he shouted, dancing upon the
boaeds. "Five! I'll cross my heart to
die I never hear tell of you, or ever
knew they was " slch a man In the
world!"
Carewe bent over him. "No! Say:
'God strike me dead and condemn me
eternally to the everlasting flames of
hell If I ever tell!'"
This entailed quick sobriety, though
only benevolence was in the face above
him^ The jig-step stopped, and the boy
pondered, frightened.
"Have I got to say that?"
Mr. Carewe produced a bank-bill
about which the boy beheld a halo.
Clearly this was his day; heaven
showed its approval of his conduct by
an outpouring of imperishable riches.
And yet the oath misllkcd him; there
was a savor of the demoniacal contract;
still that was to' be borne and 'the
plunge taken, for there fluttered the
huge sum before his dazzled eyes. He
took a deep breath. " 'God strike mÂ»
dead'^ " â he began, slowly â " 'if I
ever' "
"-. "No. 'And condemn me to the ever
lasting flames of hell* "
"Have I got to?"
"Yes."
â " 'And condemn me to â to the ever
lasting flames ofâ of hell, if I ever
tell!'" . .
He ran off, pale with the fear that he
might grow up. take to drink and some
day tell In his cups, but, so resolved
not to coquet with' temptation , that he
went around a block to avoid the door
of the Rouen House bar. Nevertheless,
the note was* in .his hand and' the for
tune in his pocket. â¢
And Mr. Carewe. was safe. He knew
that the boy would never tell, and he
knew another thing, for he f read the
Journal, , though It came no more to
bis house; he knew. that Tom Vanrevel
wore his uniform that evening, and that

Tor a gun steadied along; the ledge of a
window. As he entered the gates and
â went toward the house he glanced up
at the window which overlooked his
garden from the cupola.
CHAPTER XVIII.
THE UNIFORM.
Cralley was not the only man in
Rouen who had been saying to himself
all day that each accustomed thing hÂ«
did was done for the last time. Many
of his comrades went* about with
"Farewell, old friend," in their hearts,
not only fc-r the people, but for thÂ»
usual things of life and the actions of
-habit, now become unexpectedly dear
and sweet to know or to perform. So
Tom Vanrevel. relieved of his hot uni
form, loose a3 to collar, wearing a
big dressing-gown, and stretched in a
chair, watched the sunset from the
western window of the dusty office,
where he had dreamed through many
sunsets in summers past, and now took
his leave of this old habit of his in
silence, with a Ions' cigar, considering
the chances largely against his ever
seeing the sun go down behind the long
â  wooden bridge at the foot of Main
street again.
The ruins of the warehouses had been
removed, and the river was laid clear
to his sight: It ran between ' brown
banks like a river of rubies, and, at the
wharf, the small evening steamboat,
ugly and grim enough to behold from
near by, lay pink and lovely In that'
broad glow, tooting imminent depar
ture, although an hour might elapse
before It would back Into the current.
The sun widened, clung briefly to the
horizon, and dropped beTiind the low
hills beyond the bottom lands; the
stream grow purple, then took on a
luster of pearl as the stars came out.
while rosy distances changed to- misty
blue; the chatter of the birds In tha
Main street maples became quieter, and
through lessoning little choruses of
twittering, fell gradually Into silence.
And now the' blue dusk crept on the
town, and the corner drugstore window
lights threw mottled colors on the*
pavement. jFrom the hall, outside tha
closed office-door, came the sound of
quick, light footsteps; it was Cralley
going out; but Tom only sighed to him
self, and did not hail him. So these
light footsteps of Crailey Gray echoed
but a moment in the stairway, and
were heard no more.
A few moments 'later a tall figure,
wrapped from neck to heels In a gray
cloak, rapidly crossed the mottled
lights, and disappeared into Carews
street. This cloaked person won on
his head a soldier's cap, and Torn, not
recognizing him surely, vaguely won
dered why Tappingham Marsh chose
to muffle himself so warmly on a Jun*
evening. He noted the quick, alert
tread as unlike Marsh's unusual gait,
but no suspicion crossed his mind that
the figure might be that of his partner.
A rocket went up from the Rouen
House, then another, followed by m
salvo of anvils and a rackety discharge
of small arms; the beginning of a no
ble display -of fireworks In celebration
of the prospective victories of thÂ«
United States and the utter discomfit
ure of the Mexicans when tha Rouen
Volunteers should reach tha seat of
war, an exhibition of patriotism which
brought little pleasure to Mr. VanreveL
But over the noise of the street ha
heard his own name shouted from tha
stairway, and almost Instantly a vio
lent knocking assailed the door. Be
fore he could bid the visitor enter, tha
door was flung open by a stout and ex
cited colored woman, who, at sight of
him, threw up her hands In tremulous
thanksgiving. It was the vain Mamie.
She sank into a chair and rocked
herself to and fro, gasping to regain
her lost breath. "Bless de good God
'Imighty you aln* gone out!" aha
panted. "I run an' I run, an' I come bo
fas' I got stitches In de side Turn head
to heel!" â¢}
Term brought her a glass of water,
which she drank between gasps.
"I nevah run so befo* anduin' my.
llvin' days," she asserted. "You knows
'me, who I am an' whum I cum f urn*

"Yes, yes, I know. "Will yon tall mfl

"Miz Tanberry, suh, dat who sanded

"Yes. Why? Does she want me?**
Mamie emitted a screech. ** 'Deed sha

"Then what Is It, Mamie?"
"Lemme git my bref, suh, an* y&a

Tom regarded her with a crave atten
tion. "What made Mrs. Tanberry think
I might be coming there to-night?"
"Dey's cur'ous goin's-on In dat house,

"No; I wasn't going." Tom smiled
upon her, sadly. "I dare say there's a
simpler explanation. Don't you sup
pose that if Nelson was right and Mr.
Carewe really did come back, It was
because he did not wish his daughter
and Mrs. Tanberry to know thatâ that
hÂ» expected a party of friends, possibly,
to join him there later?"
"What he doin' wid dat gun, suh?
Nobody goin' play cyahds ner frow

as Â£hÂ» rose and walked toward the
door.
"Oh, that was probably by chance."
"No, Buh!" she cried, vehemently.

"I had not dreamed of coming, tell
her, please. Probably I shall not go
out at all this evening. But it was
kind of you to come. Good-night"
He stood with a candle to light her
down the stairs, but after she had
gone he did not return to the office.
Instead, he went slowly up to his own
room, glancing first into Crailey's â the
doors of neither were often locked â to
I behold a chaos of disorder and unfin
ished packing. In his own chamber it
only remained for him to close the lids
of a few big boxes, and to pack a small
trunk which he meant to take with him
to the camp of the State troops, and he
would be ready for departure. He set
about this task, and, concluding that
there was no necessity to wear his uni
, form on the steamboat. " decided to
1 place it in the trunk, and went to the
J bed where he had folded and left it It
was not there. Nor did a thorough
search reveal it anywhere in the room.
Yet no one could have stolen it, for
when he had gone down to the office
Crailey had remained on this floor.
Mamie had come within a few minutes
after Crailey went out, and during his
. conversation with her the office door
\ had been open; no one could have
1 passed without being ceen. Also, a
* thief would have taken other things as
well as the uniform; and surely Crai
ley must have heard; Crailey would â
Crailey !
Then Tom remembered the figure in
the long cloak and the military cap,
and, with a sick heart, began to under
stand. He had read the Journal, and
he knew why Crailey might wish to
? masquerade -in a major's uniform that
j night. If Miss Carewe read it too, and
/ a strange wonder rose in her mind,
this and a word would convince her.
Tom considered it improbable that the
wonder would rise, for circumstances
had too well established her in a mis
take, trivial and ordinary enough at
first, merely the confusing of two
names by a girl new to the town, but
so strengthened by every confirmation
) Crailey's wit could compass that she
' would, no doubt, only set Cummings'
I paragraph aside as a newspaper error.
Still. Crailey had wished to be on the
safe side!
' Tom sighed rather bitterly. He was
convinced that the harlequin would
come home soon, replace the uniform
(which was probably extremely becom
ing to him, as they were of a height
I and figure much the same), and after-
J ward, in his ordinary dress, would
' sally forth to spend his last evening
with Fanchon. Tom wondered how
Crailey would feel and what he would
think about himself while he was
changing his clothes; but he remem
bered his partner's extraordinary pow
ers of mental adjustmentâ and for the
first time in his life Vanrevel made no
allowance for the other's temperament;
and there came to him a moment
when he felt that he could almost dis
like Crailey Gray.
At all events, he would go out until
Crailey Had come and left again; for he
had no desire to behold the masquer
â¢ader's return. So he exchanged his
dressing-gown for a coat, fastened his
collar, and had begun to arrange his
cravat at the mirror, when, suddenly,
the voice of the old negress seemed to
sound close beside him in the room:
"He's settin' dahâ waltin'!"
The cravat was never tied; Tom's
hands dropped to his sides as" he
started back from the staring face in
the mirror. Robert Carewe was wait
ingâand Crailey All at once there
was but one vital necessity In the
world for Tom Vanrevel. that was to
find Crailey; he must go to Craileyâ
even in Carewe's own house â he must
go to Crailey!
He dashed down the stairs and Into
the street The people were making a
great uproar in front of the hotel, ex
ploding bombs, firing muskets in the
air. sending up rockets; and rapidly
crossing the outskirts of the crowd, he
passed into Carewe street, unnoticed.
Here the detonations were not so deaf-,
ening, though the little steamboat at
the wharf was contributing to the con
fusion with all her power, screeching
simultaneously approval of the cele
bration and her last signals of depart
ure, 'â -'â¢ji
At the first corner Tom had no more
than left the . sidewalk when he 4 came
within a foot of being ridden down by
two horsemen who rode at so desper
ate a gallop that (the sound of their
hoof -beats being . lost in the uproar
from Main street) they were upon him
before he "was aware of them.
. He leaped back with an angry shout
to know who they were that they, rode
so wildly. At the same time a sharp
explosion at the foot of the street sent
a red flare over the scene, a flash, gone
with such Incredible swiftness^ into re
newed darkness that he saw the flying
horsemen almost as equestrian statues
Illumined by a flicker of lightning, but
he saw them with the same distinct
ness that lightning gives,, and recogr
nized the foremost as Robert Carewe,
And in the instant of that recognition,
Tom knew what had happened to Crai
ley Gray, for he saw the truth in the
ghastly face of his enerriy.
Carewe rode stiffly, like a man frozen
upon his horse, and his face was like
that of a frozen man; his eyes glassy
and notÂ»flxed upon his course, so that
it was a deathly thing to see. Once,
long ago, Tom had seen a man riding
for his life, and he wore this same look.
The animal bounded' and swerved un
der Vanrevel's etiemy in the mad rush
down the street, but he sat rigid, bolt
upright in the saddle, his face set to
that look of coldness.
The second rider was old Nelson, who
rode with body crouched forward, his
eyeballs like shining porcelain set in
ebony, and his arm like a flail, cruelly
lashing his own horse and his master's
with a heavy whip.
"De steamboat!" he shouted, hoarse
ly, bringing down, the lash on one and
then on the other. "De steamboat, de
steamboatâ fo' God's sake, honey, de
steamboat!"
They swept into Main street, Nelson
leaning far across to the other's bridle,
and turning both horses toward the
river, but before they had made the
corner, Tom Vanrevel was . running
with all the speed that was in him to
ward his enemy's house. The one block
between him and that forbidden
ground seemed to him miles long, and
he felt that he was running as a man
in a dream, and. at the highest pitch
of agonized exertion, covering no space
but only working the air in one place,
like a treadmill. All that was in his
mind, heart and soul was to reach
Crailey. He had known by the revela
tion of Carewe's face in what case he
would find his friend; but as he ran he
put the knowledge from him with a
great shudder, and resolved upon in
credulity in spite of his certainty. All
he let himself feel was the need to run,
to run until he found Crailey, who was
somewhere in the darkness of the trees
about the long, low house on the cor
ner. When he reached the bordering'
hedge, he did not stay for gate or- path,
but, with a loud shout, hurled himself
half over; half through, the hedge, like
a bolt from a catapult.
Lights shone from only one room in
the house, the library; but as he ran
toward the porch a candle flickered in
the hall, and there came the sound of
a voice weeping with terror.
At that he called more desperately
upon his credulity to aid him, for the
voice was Mrs. Tanberry's. If it had
been any other than she, who sobbed so
hopelessly â she who was always steady
and strong! If he could, he would have
stopped to pray, now, before he faced
her and the truth; but his flying feet
carried him on.
"Who is it?" she gasped, brokenly,
from the hall. "Mamie? Have you
brought him?"
"It's I," he cried, as he plunged
through the doorway. "It's Vanrevel."
Mrs. Tanberry set the iron candle
stick down upon the table with a crash.
"You've come too late!" she sobbed.
"Another man has taken your death on
himself." ,
He reeled back against the wall. "Oh,
God!" he said. "Oh, God, God God!
Crailey!"
"Yes," she answered. "It's the poor
vagabond that you loved so well."
Together they ran through the hall
to the library. Crailey was lying on
the sofa, his eyes closed, his head like
a piece of carven marble, the gay uni
form, in which he had tricked himself
out so gallantly, open at the throat,
and his white linen stained with a few
little splotches of red.
Beside him knelt Miss Betty, holding
her lace handkerchief upon his breast;
she was as white as he, and as mo
tionless; so that, as she knelt there, im
movable beside him, her arm like ala
baster across his breast, they might
have been a Eculptor's group. The
handkerchief was stained a little, like 1
the linen, and like it. too, stained but
a little. Near by, on the floor, stood a
flask of brandy and a pitcher of water.
"You!". Miss Betty's face showed no
change, nor even a faint surprise, as
her eyes fell upon Tom Vanrevel, but
her lips soundlessly framed the word.
"You!"
Tom flung himself on his knees be
side her.
"Crailey!" he cried in a sharp voice
that had a terrible shake in It "Crai
ley! Crailey, I want you to hear me!"
He took one of the limp hands in his
and began to chafe it, while Mrs. Tan
berry grasped the other.
"There's still a movement in the
pulse," she faltered.
"Still!" echoed'Tom, roughly. "You're
mad! You made me think Crailey was
dead! Do .you think Crailey Gray is
going to die? He couldn't. I tell youâ
he couldn't; you don't know him!
Who's gone for the doctor?" He
dashed some brandy upon his handker
chief and set it to the white lips.
"Mamie. She was here in the room
with ine when it happened." â¢
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
" 'Happened'! . 'Happened'!" he
mocked her, furiously. " 'Happened' is
a beautiful word!" :' y -
! "God forgrve me!" sobbed Mrs. Tan
berry. "I was I sitting in the library,
and Mamie had just ', come , from you,
when we heard Mr. Carewe shout from
the cupola room: 'Stand away from my
daughter, Varirevel, and take7 this, like
a dog!'. -Only thatâ and /Mamie and I
ran to the window, and we saw through
the dusk a.man In uniform leap back
from Miss Bettyâ they/were in that lit
tle space near the hedge, â¢â .-â  He called
out something and waved his hand, but
the shot came at the same time, 1 and he
fell. Even â  then; I ;. was sure, â  in ; spite of
what Mamie \ had "said, I was as sure
as Robert Carewe. was that it was you.
He came and took one lookâ arid sawâ
and then Nelson brought the horses'
and made him mount -and -go. Mamie
ran for the doctor, and Betty and I
carried Crailey in. It was haird work."
Miss Betty's hand : had ; fallen from
Crailey's breast where; Tom's took Its
place. She. rose unsteadily to her, feet
and pushed back the hair from her
forehead, shivering convulsively as she
looked down at the' iriotlonless figure
on the sofa. . â  . !
"Crailey!" said Tom, in the same
angry; shaking voice. "Crailey, you've
got to rouse yourself! This won't do;
you've got to Â«be a man! -Crailey!" He
was trying to force the brandy through
the tightly clenched teeth. ."Crailey!"
"Crailey!" whispered Miss >Betty.
leaning, heavily on the back of a chair.
"Crailey?" ; ,
It was then that Crailey's eyelids
fluttered and slowly opened; and his
wandering glance, dull. at first, slowly
grew clear and twinkling as it rested
on the ashy, stricken face of his best
friend. ; â ^<%i'!. 'â 'â 
"Tom," he said, feebly, "it was worth
the price to wear your clothes .Just
once!" â¢
And then, at last, .Miss Betty saw and
understood. For not the- honest gentle
man, whom every one except Robert
Carewe held' In esteem and. affection,
not. her father's enemy, Vanrevel, lay
before her with the death wound in his
breast for her sake, but that otherâ
Crailey Gray, the rie'er-do-weel and
light-o'-love. Crailey Gray, wit, poet
and 'scapegrace, the well-beloved town
scamp. . . .
He saw that she knew, andf, as his
brightening eyes wandered up to her,
he smiled faintly. "Even a bad dog
likes to have his day," he whispered. â 'â¢
CHAPTER XIX.
Will Cummings had abandoned the
pen for the swoul until such time: as
Santa Anna should cry for quarter, and
had left the lOince in charge of an im
ported substitute; but. late that 'njght
he came. to his.desk once more, to write
the story of the accident to Corporal
Gray; v and the- talc that he wrote had
been already put into writing by Tom
Vanrevel as it fell from Crailey's lips,
after the - doctor had come, Â« so that
none might doubt it. . No one diddoubt
it. , What reasc-n had Mr. Carewe to
injure Crailey Gray? Only five in
Rouen ,lÂ£new the truth; for Nels.6"n had
gonerwIVh'ti is master, and, except Sja
mie, the other servants of the Carewe
household had been .among tbe crowd
in front of the Rouen House when'the
shot was fired.
So the stc-ry went over the town; how
Crailey had called to say good-by to
Mrs. Tanberry; how Mr. Carewe hap
pened to be examining the musket his
father had carried in 1812, when the
weapon was accidentally discharged,
the ball entering Crailey's breast; how
Mr. Carewe, stricken with remorse and
horror over this frightful misfortune,
and suffering too severe anguish of
mind to remain upon the ecene of the
tragedy which his carelessness had
made, had fled, attended by his servant;
and how they had leaped aboard the
evening boat as it was pulling out, and
were on their way down the river.
And this was the story, too, mat Tom
told Fanchon; for it was he who
brought lier to Crailey. Through the
long night she knelt at Crailey's side,
his hand always pressed to her breast
or cheek, her eyes- always upward, and
her lips moving with her prayers, not
for Crailey to be spared, but that the
Father would take good care of him in
heaven till she came. "I had already
given him up," she said to Tom, meek
ly, in a small voice. "I knew it was to
come, and perhaps this way is better
than that â I thought it would be far
away from me. Now I can be with
him, and perhaps I shall have him a
little longer, for he was to have gone
away before noon."
The morning sun rose upon a fair
world, gay with bird-chatterings from
the big trees of the Carewe place, and
pleasant with the odors of Miss Betty's
garden, and Crailey, lying upon the bed
of the man who had shot him, hark
ened and smiled good-by tothe summer
he loved; -and, when th^ day broke,
asked that the bed be moved so that
he might He close to the window. ~ It
was Tom who had borne him to that
room. "I have carried him before this,"
he said,. waving the others aside.
Not long after sunrise, when the bed
had been moved near the window,
Crailey begged Fanchon to bring him a
miniature of his mother which he had
given her, and urged her to go for it
herself: he wanted no hands but hers
to touch it, he said. And when she had
gone he -asked to be left alone with
Tom.
"Give me your hand, Torn," he said,
faintly. "I'd like to, keep hold of it a
minute or so. I couldn't have said that
yesterday, could I, without causing. us
both horrible embarrassment? But I
fancy I can now, because I'm done for.
That's too bad, -isn't- it? I'rh very
young, after all. Do you remember
what poor Andre Chenier said as he
went up to be guillotined?â 'There were
things in this. head ; of : mine!'* But I
want to tell you what's been the 1 mat
ter with me. It was just my. being a.
bad sort of poet .. I- suppose that I've"
never loved any one; yet I've cared
more "deeply than other men for every
lovely thing r ever, saw, arid there's so
little that' hasn't loveliness in it I'd
be ashamed not to have cared for the
beauty in all' women I've made love to
â but about this oneâ the most beauti
ful of allâ I-T7-" .
"She will understand!" said - Tom.
quickly. V â >.; .
"She willâ yes-^she's wise and good.
If Fanchori knew/, there wouldn't be
even a memory. left to" herâ and I don't
think she'd i live. And "do you know, I
"believe I've done a favor for Miss Betty
in getting myself shot; Carewe: will

man's. knavery bo exactly the architect
of his own destruction as mine J -And
for what gain? 'Just the excitement
of the comedy from day to day!â f6r"
she: was sure to, despise me as soon as
she knewâ and the desire to hear her
voice say another kindly thing to meâ
and the" everlasting perhaps in every
woman, arid this one the Heart's De
sire of the world! Ah, well! Tell me â
I want. to hear it from youâ how many
hours does the doctor say?" â ,â¢,.',..
"Hours, Crailey?" Tom's hand
twitched pitifully In the other's feeble
grasp. ."â -. $ , .
"I know It's only a few." \
"They're all fools, doctors!" exclaim
ed Vanrevel,' fiercely..
"No, no. Arid I know that nothing
can be done. You all see, it, and you
want me to go easilyâ or you wouldn't
let me have my own way so much! It
frightens me,- I own up, -to" think that
so soon I'll be wiser than the wisest 1
in the world. Yet I always wanted to
know. I've sought and I've soughtâ
but now to go out alone on the search
it must be the search, for the Holy
Grailâ Iâ"
"Please don't talk," begged Tom, in
a broken whisper. "For mercy's sake,
lad. It wears on you so."
Crailey , laughed weakly. "Do you
think I- could die peacefully without
talking- a great deal?'.'.
After a- little while, he closed his eyes
with a, sigh; the doctor bent over him
quickly, and Miss Betty started for
ward unconsciously and cried out
I But the bright eyes opened again and
fixed themselves upon her with all their
- old gay inscrutability. â¢
"Not yet," said Crailey. . "Miss Ca
rewe, may I tell you that I am sorry
I could not have known you sooner?
Perhaps you might have liked me for
Fanchon's sakeâ I know, you care for
her." ' . .
"I doâ I do!" she faltered. "I love
her, andâ ah!â I do like you, Mr.,Gray,
for I know you, though I neverâ met
-you untilâ last, night . God bless youâ
God bless you!"
She wavered a moment, like a lily in
the wind, and put out a hand blindly.
"Not you!" she said sharply, as Tom
Vanrevel starte'd toward her. Mrs.
Tanberry came quickly and put an arm
about !her, and together they went out
of the* room.
.'"You must be good to her, Tom,"
said Crailey then, in a very low voice.
"I!" answered Tom. gently. "There
was never a chance of that, lad."
"Listen " whispered Crailey.' "Lean
downâ noâ closer." He cast a quick
glance at Fanchori, kneeling at the
other side of the Tied, her. golden head
on the white coverlet, her outstretched
hand clutching his; and he spoke so
close to Tom's ear and in. so low a
tone that only Tom could hear.
"She never cared for me. She felt
that she ought to â but that was only
because I masqueraded in your history.
She wanted to tell me before I went
away that there was no chance for me.
She was telling me that, when he called
from the window. It was at the dance,
the. night before, that she knew. I
think there has been some one else
from the firstâ God send it's you! Did
you speak to her that night or she to
you?" <
"Ah, no," said Tom Vanrevel. "All
the others." l
Mrs. Tanberry and Betty and Mr. Ba
reaud waited in the library, the two
women huddled together on a sofa,
with their arms around each other and
all the house was very still.
The warm day beyond the window
became like Sunday, no voices sounded
from without-In the noon hush, though
sometimes a little group of people
would gather across the street to eye
the house curiously and nod and whis
per. The strong, blue shadows of the
veranda pillars stole slowly -across the
white floor of the porch in a lessening
slant, and finally lay In a line as the
tall clock in a corner of the library
asthmatically coughed the hour of
noon. In this jarring discordance
there was" something frightful to Miss
Betty. She rose abruptly, and, imperi
ously waving back Mrs. Tanberry, who
would have .detained herâ for there
was in her face and manner the incip
ient wildness of control overstrained
to the breaking-pointâ she went hur
riedly out of the room and out of the
house, to the old bench in the garden.
There she sank down, her face hidden
in her arms; there on the spot where
she had first seen Crailey Gray.
From there, too, had risen the sere
nade of the man she had spurned and
insulted; and there she had . come to
worship the stars when Crailey bade
her look to them. And now the strange
young teacher was paying the bitter
price for his fooleriesâ and who could
doubt that the price was. a bitter one?
To have the spirit so suddenly, cruelly
riven from the sprightly â ', body that
was but a few hours ago hale and
alert, obedient to every petty wish,
could dance, run and leap; to be forced
with" such hideous precipitation' to
leave the warm breath of June and un
dergo the lonely change, merging, with
the shadow; to be flung from the ex
quisite and commonplace day of sun
shine Into the appalling adventure that
should not have been his. for years
and hurled into it by what hand!â ah,"
bitter, bitter price for a. harlequinade!
And,; alas, alas! for the brave harle
quin!
A gentle touch fell upon her shoul
der, and Miss Betty sprarig to her feet
and screamed. It was Nelson\ who
etood before her, hat in hand, his head
deeply; bowed.
"Is he. with you?" she cried, clutch
ing:, a. t the bench for support
. "No'm," answereel the old man. hum
bly. "I reckon we all ain' goin'' see
dat man no mo*."
"Where is he?" .
"On de way, honey ,~on de way."
"The wayâ to Rouen!" she gasped.
"Nd'm; he goin', cross de big water."
He stretched out his hand and pointed
solemnly to the east. "Him an* me
cotch de boat, an' yo" pa mek 'em taken
de hosses on bode. Den we git off at
Leevllle, five mile* down de rivuh, an'

'Peah to me. Missy, like he done had a
;vlzhum er he own soul, when he come
an' look down at dat young man layin'
on de" grass, las' night!"
Miss . Betty threw herself upon the
bench again,! face downward in her
arms. And still the house lay. in si
lence under the sunshine.
An hour had passed, arid the shadows
slanted strongly to the east, when the
stillness was broken by a sound, low
and small at first, then rising fearfully,
a long, * quavering wail of supreme an
guish that clutched and shook the lis
tener's heart No one could have re
cognized the voice as Fanchon's, yet
everyone who heard It knew that it
was hersV and that the soul of Cariley
Gray had gone out upon the quest for
the Holy Graih
. Miss Betty's hands clenched convul
sively round the arm of the bench and
a fit of shuddering seized her as if with
the grip of a violent chill, though "her
eyes were dry. Then she lay quiet.
' A long time afterwward, she became
aware of a step that paced the garden
path behind her. and turned her face
upon Her. arm so that she saw, but
made no other motion. It was Tom
Vanrevel, walking slowly up and down,
his hands behind his back and his hat
pulled down over his eyes. He had not
seen her.
She rose and spoke his name.
He turned and came to her. "Almost
at the very last," he said. "Crailey
whispered to me that he knew you
thought him a great scamp, but to- tell
you to be sure to remember that It was
/all true about the stars."
CHAPTER XX.
"GOOD-BY."
It was between twilight, and candle
light, the gentle half-hour when the
kind old Sand Man steals up the stairs
of houses where children are; when
rustic lovers stroll with slow and quiet
steps down country lanes, and old bach
elors are loneliest and dream of the
things that might have been. Through
the silence of the clear dusk came the
whistle of the evening boat that was to
bear Tom Vanrevel through the first
stage of his long journey to the front
of war, and the aound fell cheerlessly
upon Miss Betty's ear, as she stood
leaning against the sun dial among the
lilac bushes. Her attitude was not one
of reverie; yet she stood very still, so
still that, in the wan shimmer of the
faded afterglow, one might have passed
close by her and not have seen her.
The long, dark folds of her gown
showed faintly against the gray stone,
and her arms, bare from the elbow, lay
across the face of the dial with unre
laxed fingers clenching the cornice; her
head drooping, not languidly but with
tension, her eyes half closed, showing
the lashes against a pale c*heek; and
thus, motionless, leaning on. the, stone
In the dusk, she might have been Sor
row's self.
She did not move, there was not even
a flicker of the eyelashes, when a step
sounded on the gravel of the driveway,
and Vanrevel came slowly from the
house. He stopped at a little distance
from her, hat In hand. He was very
thin, worn and old-looking, and in the
failing light might have been taken for
a tall, gentle ghost; yet his shoulders
were squared and he held himself as
straight as he had the first time she
had ever seen him.
"Mrs. Tanberry tbld me I should find
you here," he "said, hesitatingly. "I
have come to say good-by."
She did not turn toward him, nor did
more than her lips ntove as she an
swered, "Good-by," and her tone was
neither kind nor cold, but held no
meaning whatever, not even indiffer
ence.-
There. was an interval of silence;
then.* without surprise, he walked sad
ly to the gate, paused, wheeled about
suddenly, and returned with a quick,
firm step.
"I will not go until I know that I do
not misunderstand you," he said, "not
even if there Is only the -slightest
chance that I do. I want to say some
thing to you, if you ; will let me,
though naturally I remember you once
asked me never to speak to you again.
It is only that I have thought you did
that under a misconception, or else I
should still obey you. If. you â "
"What is it that you wish to say?"
Her tone was'unchanged.
"Only, that I think the hardest time
for you has passed, and thatâ "
"Do you?" she interrupted.
"Yes," he returned, "the saddest of
your life. I think it has gone forever.
And I think that what will conSe to you
will be all you wish for. There will be
a little time of waitingâ "
"Waiting for what?"
He drew a step nearer, and his voice
became very gentle. "Cummings and I
reach our regiment to-morrow night:
and there in the camp is a group of men
on the way to the war, and- they all go
the more bravely because each one of
them has you in his heartâ not one but
will be a better soldier because of you.
I want you to believe that if all of them
don't come back, yet the one whose
safety you think of and fear for will re
turn. For, you see, Crailey told me
what you said to him whenâ when he
met you here the last time. I have no
way to know which of them you meant;
butâ he will come back to you! I am
sure of it, because I believe you are to
be happy. Ah, you've had your allot
ment of pain! After all, there is so lit
tle to regret; the town seems empty
without its young men, yet you may re
joice, remembering how bravely they
went and how gayly! They will sins
half the way to Vera Cruz! You think
It strange I should say there Is so lit
tle to regret, when I've just laid away
my best friend. It was his own doc
trine, and the selfish personal grief and
soreness grows less when I think of the
gallant end he made, for It was he who
went away most bravely and Jauntily
of all.. Crailey was no failure, unless I
let what hs taught me go to no effect.
And be sure he would have told you
what I Â»tell you. now, that all is well
with all in the world."
"Please!" she cried, with a quick in
take of breath through closed teeth.
"I will da anything in the world* to
please you," he answered, sorrowfully.
"Do you mean that â "
She. turned at last and faced him. but
without lifting her eyes. "Why did you
come to say good-by to me?"
"I don't understand."
"I think you do." Her voice was cold
and steady, but it was suddenly given
to him to perceive that she was trem
bling from head to heel.
An exclamation of remorse broke
from him.
"Ah! You came here to be alone. I â "
"Stop," she said. "You said good-by
to me once before. Did you come to
see â what you saw then?"
He fell back in utter amazement, but
she advanced upon him swiftly. "Was
it that?" she cried.
. The unfortunate young- man could
make no reply, and remained unable to
defend himself from her inexplicable
attack.
"You have not forgotten," she went
on. impetuously. "It was in the crowd,
just before they gave you the flag. You
saw â I know you saw â and it killed me
with the shame of it! Now you come to
me to look at the same thing againâ
and the boat waiting for you! Is It in
revenge for that night at the Ba
rt-auds".' Perhaps this somrds wild to
you â I can't help that â but why should
yc-u try to make it harder for me?"
From the porch came a strong voice:
"Vanrevel!"
"God knows I haven't meant to,"
said Tom, in bitter pain. "I don't un
rterstand. It's Cummings calling for
me; I'll go at once. I'd hoped, stupid
ly enough, that you would tell me
whom it was you meant when you
spoke to Crailey, so that I could help
to make it surer that he's come back to
you. But I've only annoyed you.. And
you were here â away from the house
avoiding me, and fearing that I â "
â¢'Vanrevel!" shouted William. (Mrs.
Tanberry had not told Lieutenant
Cummings where to find Miss Betty.)
"Fearing? Yes?"
"Fearing that I might discover you."
He let his eyes rest on her loveliness
once more, and as he saw that she still
trembled, he extended his hand toward
her in a gesture of Infinite gentleness,
like a blessing, heaved one great sigh,
and, with head erect and body straight,
set his face manfully toward the house.
He had taken three strides when hl3
"heart stopped beating at an ineffable
touch on his sleeve. For, with a sharp
cry, she sprang to him; and then, once
more, among the lilac bushes where he
had caught the white kitten, his hand
was seized and held between two small
palms, and the eyes of Miss Betty Ca
rewe looked Into the very soul of him.
"No!" she cried. "No! Fearing with
a sick-heart that you might not come!"
Her pale face, misty with sweetness,
wavered before him In the dusk, and ho
lifted his shaking hand to his forehead;
her own went with it, and the touch of
that steadied him.
"You mean," he whispered, brokenly,
"you mean that you â "
"Yes, always," she answered, rush
ing through the words, half In tears.
"There was a little time when I loved
what your life had been more than you.
Ah, it was you that I saw in him. Yet
It was not what you had done after all,
but Just you! I knew there could not be
anyone elseâ though I thought it could
never be youâ that night, Just before
they gave the flag."
"We've little time, Vanrevel!" called
the voice from the porch.
Tom's eyes filled slowly. He raised
them and looked at the newly comÂ©
stars. "Crailey, Crailey!" he mur
mured.
Her gaze followed his. Ah, it's heâ
and theyâ that make me know you will
come back to me!" she said.

in rough corduroy trousers thrust
into long boots, blue flannel shirt and
handkerchief knotted loosely about
the powerful throat, he looked a man
to innuence others, and the Bishop, no
mean reader of men. was satisfied.
"I wish that I could have remained
a bit longer." he thought regretfully
as he settled himself comfortably in
the vide seat. "Four days is really
too short for a parochial visit."
The man left behind heartily echoed
the Bishop's sentiments. It had been
like a breath out of another world, this
few days'- intercourse with a lofty and
cultivated personality. Under his own
calm, blue eyes lay an ardent and en
thusiastic nature, which had as yet
found but little to develop it. The
Bishop's inspiring talk had awakened
an instant response, that now made
itself felt as an unsatisfied want. His

"Thet ain't a bad plan," agreed

Three men, hurrying to the worst
scenes of disaster, paused in amaze

with clasped hands and olosed eyes.
A tall neighbor stepped forward so
licitously. "Are you blinded, Mr. Ha

"Guess not, Marvin," responded
Enoch, quivering his eyelids for a rapid

chuckled. "Why, the cyclone has lifted

he added. "Come out on the sidewalk

man slouchlngly lazily along, his -face
brightened.
"That pesky tramp has been hanging
about for a week, asking work," he
thought. "Here, you,'"he called aloud.
The man started, came forward sus
piciously, his eye on Robinson's hip
pocket. The latter frowned.
"Here, wake up," he growled. "You
say you want work! Go up to my cab
in then, fix it up, and thenâ then wait
till I come," his Invention giving out.
The man only stared and Robinson's
wrath overflowed.
"Don't stand gaping there like a
blasted idiot," he roared. "Get along
with you, and double quick, too. "See
you have things well cleaned up by
the time I get there or I'll make it hot
for you. Here's the key."
Robinson's methods were convincing
and the man, after one glance to assure
himself of the speaker's sincerity,
turned and departed in haste. With a
relieved sigh Robinson crossed to the
nearest saloon. ' x '
"It's on me, boya," he remarked
cheerfully. "What'II you have?"
When finally Robinson mounted the
hill to his cabin, night had fallen and
the memory of the tramp had entirely
escaped him. To his astonishment the
"NIXIE CLERK" AT MAIL MORGUE
X">f LIPSHOD carelessness Is a nat-
tlonal trait and statistics show It
Irj to be on the increase If we but
4*"^ consider the blundering public's
voluntary contribution to the dead let
ter office. ,
Superintendent Cox of the local post
office has some curious facts to contrib
ute about this -sams carelessness. "Our
office," he says, "contains an array of
unclaimed Christmas packages that
have become detached from their ad
dress, while Tom, Dick or Harry in the
East or over ln China or "somewhere
east of Suea", la waiting for a letter of
acknowledgment. Many a misunder
standing of lifelong consequence has
arisen from fool carelessness of this
sort. The dead letter office holds the
clew to many an unexplained mystery.
"We have a clerk in the postofflce
whom, for want of a better name, we
call the 'nixie clerk.' His business is
to ferret out, if possible, the correct
address from the hieroglyphics on the
envelope and give the letter a> few last'
'tries' before it is sent to the dead let
ter office. k~ :
"In the manner of misdirecting a let
ter there are masculine mistimes and
feminine mistakes. The following in
stance Illustrates a mistake of daily
occurrence. A business man will write
the street address of some firm in the
East and then, from force of habit, put
'city.' The letter Is stamped 'No such
number' and turned over to the 'nixie
clerk.' This type of error is ! chronic
with a surprising number of, business
men. The 'nixie clerk' overhauls postal
guides and bulletins for the missing
city, which be finds through the streets,
or returns the letter for 'better ad

"The most flagrant feminine offense
consists of adding or omitting a num

dented, and on the hearth lay tne last
embers of a fire. Recollection came
quickly, and with hurried fingers he
lighted a candle to gaze about the
tidied room. Everything seemed 1 In or
der. But the man was gone, and with
an exclamation Robinson darted to the
cupboard where was kept his dearest
possession. , Those new boots! One
glance sufficed, the boots were gone.
In their place stood a pair of rusty
high lows, arid at that sight Robinson's
rage found words. In fluent and pic
turesque English he cursed emphati
cally and categorically himself, his be
longings, the tramp and all that be
longed to him; he even began on" the
Bishop, but checked that. The Bishop's
theory might be good.
"But out, here it's durned poor prac
tice," thought Robinson ruefully.
"Where can the skunk have gone? He
must have 'em on." i
There was practically only one way
out of the % townâ the railroadâ and a
sudden remembrance of the waiting
freight cars flashed across Robinson's
mfnd. To seize the lantern, light it and
lock the door behind him was but the
work of a minute: in the next he had
started down the hill on a dog-trot, the
dresses and other marks of Identifica
tion Inside, or at least to write their
own addresses ln the heading. They
are also more committal regarding sig
natures, more often signing their full
name, while women close with 'Loving
ly 'yours, Nell'; 'Your Bister, Ann,' etc.
The initial signature Is purely feminine.
"Our 'nixie clerk' is a surprisngly
clever sleuth, putting thousands of
sidetracked missives on the main line
yearly. He never * flags ln his perse
verance or begrudges them a final 'try.'
"The power to. open dead letters is
delegated to especially deputized clerks

General dares ,to open even the most
Insignificant looking of them.".
Curiosity does not dog the genii
whose Job it is to find out where and
how the other feJlow's brain slipped a

Even at the dead letter morgue
there Is a 'distinction, -the subjects be

and "alive."' The hopelessly dead letter
might; per example, be headed "Grand

clew as to the Identity, of the writer
or his future plans as to whereabouts
might kindle , some spark of hope in
the breast of the deputy. _

Into the dark, dirty car, where lay a
few tattered relics, turned out now and
then by an irate conductor or busy
freight hand, but always slipping back,
came Robinson with determined mien,
lantern In one hand, pistol in the other.
"Hold up your feet," he said sharply.
The men roused, dazed and protesting
from heavv slumbers, stared bewild
eredly' as they thrust out feet drawn
out from beneath straw or sacking.
What new game was this? Robinson,
heedless of question or criticism, after
a quick flash of the lantern, hurried to
the next car, leaving a wake of dis
gusted chaff.
Through four cars plodded Robinson,
and then in the fifth he received a
shock. From the darkness came a voice
unmistakably declining to show the re
quired foot. "Robinson's voice softened
ominously.
"I think you had better," he began
gently, "otherwise I shall have to make

wail, "let me alone. I haven't done

longer. Then the Major came.
. "Hello," he said, and passed us to
give his order at the desk. Then he
sat down at a table and began to write
rapidly. He called the boy again and
asked that he ring for a messenger.
The messenger appeared. The Major
handed him a note and some coins and
told him to take a cab.
"Must be In a hurry," suggested
Channing.
"I am," said the Major, "for if that
note doesn't get where It belongs with
in tin hour it will be all up with Kem
ble." '
He sat dowii with us and began stir
ring his rum thoughtfully.
"Great stuff, rum," he said. "I've
been thinking for a long time that I'm
going to spend my declining years
down on the Cape somewhere. I shall
have a thatched cottage, some nastur
tiums growing In a wrecked dory on
the lawn, and I shall sit on the beach,
dressed in a sou'wester and oilskins,
scanning the horizon for incoming lug
gers. Each Itfgger will be laden with
hot buttered rum."
The Major sipped his drink medita
tively.
"You fellows want to hear a love
story?" he asked.
"Yes, let her go," said Wilton.
We settled back in our chairs, pre
pared to listen, for it was an unusual
thing for the Major to volunteer a story
of any kind.
"I shan't tell you the end of the
story till the boy gets back." he began.
"Is the boy the â  hero?" inquired
Channing. -
â¢ "Not exactly, but he bears an Im
portant message to the hero." said the
Major.
' Then he went on, and none of us in
terrupted him for some minutes. He
talked slowly, and picked his words
carefully.
"It was this way," ho began. "There
stunned. "Go away. And my bootaâ "
"Feet up nqw." Interrupted Robinson,
curtly. "Here, let mo see you," slip
ping the lantern closer. A tall, slender
boy In ragged clothing was revealed,
gazing up with white face und implor
ing eyes. No one else waa ln the car,
and for a second Robinson hesitated.
"But you may be a pa!." he de
cided. "Put 'em up at once. Lord,
what a fus3 about nothing." aa a pair
of small, travel-stained boots madÂ«
reluctant appearance. "You needn't
worry about those; they" look more
like a woman's, feet," with a short
laugh. The sound of a .^mothered sob
reached his ear and Robinson, start-
Ing, bent lower. "A woman; dog
goned if It ain't a woman," he ut
tered slowly. "Say, what are you do
ing here?" with a complete change of
tone. Th<e sob3 deepened.
"I â I'm trying to get East," sh<Â»
wept- "Jly people are there and
I "
"But how came you her*, this
way?" The girl, after a quick glance
at the handsome, interested face felt
her courage returning 1 .
"I went out 'with my father," she
began timidly. "Then he married
again and hl3 wife â she wasn't good
to me. But dad always looked after
me until he got killed in a fight. She
got worse after that â she wanted me
â I couldn't stand it." with a waver
ing look. "So I took some of father's
clothes and got away# I hadn't much
money, so I had to steal rides, and
nobody suspected until you. to-night.
You see. I couldn't wear father's
boots?" The big eyes filled again
with tears and Robinson felt like a
condemned criminal.
"Oh, say. don't cry." ho muttered
clumsily. In spite of Its sheath of
dirt -and grime he could detect thÂ»
fÂ«iir prettmesa'of the girl's face and
a growing admiration for her pluck
made him grind his teeth at the idea
of what she might have to meet. It
was ridiculous for a girl to think of
such a thing. Yet he couldn't ask her
to go back. Nor could he keep her
unless, with a sudden brightening of
his countenance, he set down the lan
tern and took both her hands In his.
"Look here." said he diffidently. "I'm
a poor lot, perhaps; I haven't got
much saved, and mine ain't much of
a home. But such as It Is, it's yours
if you will only take It."
The girl, her eyea widening In bewil
derment, drew back.
"You mean?" she asked faintly.
"I mean â I mean that I want you for
my wife,, little woman. Of course, I
ain't near good enough," huskily. "But
I'll treat you well andâ I've been lone
some, for a fact, though I didn't know
It, so if you could only see your way
clear to favoring me â to giving me a
chance." his tone sank to entreaty and
the girl, who had listened Incredulous
ly, uttered a little cry and dropped her
forehead to the hands that still held
hers, firm, steady hands that any wo
man- could trust. Robinson's clasp
tightened.
"You mean that you will." he said ex
citedly, as a shamed little nod an
swered him. "God bless you, little
woman. Bay," struck by a Jubilant
thought, "I Just bet you the Bishop will
come back and marry us."
And the Bishop did.
was a man once who was a lawyer,
and he had a ward who had been left
to his care by her father when ha died.
The lawyer was a bachelor and he
took the girl under his care, and man
aged her property, and sent her to
school, and to college and abroad, and
wherever he thought she might grow
to be the woman her father had hoped
she might be. Then when she cams
home to live he fell in lova.wlth her.
That's all there is of the first chap
ter."
The Major picked up his' glass and
held it between the light and his eyes.
"Great stuff, hot buttered rum en a
cold night," he commented.
Then he went on: "This man found
that he was forgetting to do his work.
He was thinking about her most of
the time, and he began to lose confi
dence in his ability to win cases. He
lost some that he should have won.
Then he began to reason with himself.
and he suddenly discovered that ho
couldn't do anything more, anyhow, till
he had told her he loved her and found
out what she thought about it. Mind
you, he waa old enough to bo her
father.
"So one night he went to her house
and was prepared to tell her what he
wanted to. They sat together before
the library fire. Then the man began
to talk. 1 have thought. Dorothy.' he
said, that It Is about time you were
married.' Then the young woman
came over and laid her hand on his
shoulder. 1 have thought so, too,* shÂ»
said.
"The man went on talking. Is there
any one you care for particularly?* he
asked. 'Yes,' she said, 'but we quar
reled after we had been engaged two
days, andâ I know I ought to have
told you about thÂ« engagement, but
Uncls Billy, honest, I wanted to keep
it to myself for a llttla time yet.'
"Then the man tried to tell her how
much he loved her, but somehow he
couldn't. He Just asked her who- the
man was that she had become engaged
to. She told him. and told him, too.
that the quarrel didn't amount to any
thing, and that she wanted him to come
to luncheon with you, Gregory" â and
the Major turned to me â "and me to
morrow at 1 o'clock."
"What do you mean?" I asked.
"Wait till the boy comes back," said
the Major.
Presently the boy returned with a
note. The Major opened it and read it.
Then be handed It to me. This waa
what it said:
"My Dear Majorâ Will meet you and
Mr. Gregory with my mother and Miss
Gordon at the Touraine at 1 to-mor
row. Thank you for what you have
done. Very sincerely, â¢
"A. L. KEMBLE."
"Channing." began the Major when I
had finished reading, "and you. Wilton,
you are both pretty close friends of our
families, and I am glad I have the hon
or of announcing to you the engage
ment of Mr. Gregory's niece and my
ward. Miss Dorothy Selden. to Mr. Al
fred L. Kemble."
The Major -and I received the con
gratulations of the others, for we all
liked Kemble tremendously. Then the
Major ordered some more hot drinks.
"When I get my thatched cottage down
on the Cape will you chaps come down
and help me scan the horizon?" he
asked. "I shall be pretty lonesome un

A FORE-ORDAINED PARTNERSHIP

alone, and she fol
lowed wearily the trail of the years
that had brought only trouble and loss.
Jessica stood still in the doorway at
Eight of the bowed head. She could
find no words to say; but she drew Miss
Rebecca's head dow n and held her close
in the strong, young arms. Miss Rebec
ca lifted a hopeless face. "Child. I do
not mourn for him; it is you. Jessica,
this old house and a pitiful ten acres is
all that is left; and even that cannot be
told during my lifetime. There is noth
ing, nothing. Don't talk to me now. I
cannot beaji it â I must try to think."
And 21iss Rebecca crept away to her
loom.
Left to herself, the girl stood looking
out toward the clump of liveoaks that
towered above the general's grave. She
remembered that there had always
been little economies practiced by Miss
Rebecca, and the days when the gen
eral would shut himself in with a mass
of papers â always after the visits of
those men from town. Now the end
had come; but the old home was still
theirs, evtn though shorn of its broad
acres, and an idea came to her. That
night she wrote the letter that went in
the Northern mail, signed with the bay
ish scrawl of "J. L. Marvin."
Business was unusuallr dull in the
cfSce of Itcpplier Bros., florists, and the
morning mail received Instant atten
tion. James Repplicr tossed a letter
across to his brother John. "Read that,
John."
"Repplier Bros. â Gentlemen: Is there
any market for cut flowers direct from

"Aldana, Miss."
John Repplier laid the- letter doy.n
and looked up inquiringly. "Might be
a good Idea. What co you think?"
"Well! We will be pretty apt to
n*M a large supply in the next forty
c'.ght hours, as that Garl'ng funeral

from our ov/n plant."
Ten minutes later the message went
nfT that electrified the household at
Bois d'Arc.
"Send aJI available blooms. Letter
to follow. Terms guaranteed.
"REPPLIER BROS."
Miss Rebecca was bewildered at the
very Idea of money to be gained from
the profusion that rioted in hedge
and arbor nnd over the wasi<? of un
kept gardens; but Jessica rallied the
idle negroes and worked all night un
til the dawn, when Uncle Reuben
drove down to Aldana with a wagon
load of baskets filled to the brim with
frazrant merchandise.
Evening brought the letter that
!nade possibility certainty, and busy
clays followed for Jessica. More land
v.as leased and a little offlce con

the gin, that now served as a packing
roorn. Miss Rebecca willingly let go
the reins of Bols d'Arc into Jessica's
hands. Once more Aunt Ailsa re

lÂ»y bit, the old order was restored, ex
cepting always the tall, soldierly fig

â¢Jiem forever.
November had come and a soft haze
lay over the sunny fields and a tang
of frost lurked In the breeze. Jessica
lay in the hammock under the pines,
her loosened hair blown back in a
ruddy halo and the bars of sunlight
flecking the smooth olive - of her

"I fcep pardon, but is this Bois

"Yes. this is Bo:s d'Arc. I am the
manager."
"You? J. L. Marvin?" ReppHer
stared blankiy. "But we had sup

"That I were a man?" she broke in
nervously; then, looking at the card
that he handed her. "Mr. Repplier?"
and a little later Reppller found hlin
ee!f in the dim. old parlor receiving
the gentle welcome of Miss Rebecca.
He was carried away with Bois
d'Arc and- its vague air of a better
time that dimly expressed the actual
assured position that had been his life
motive. Self-made, from the days of
drifting waithood, when the two home
less boys had ttrugsled against the
current of the Chicago streets, it had
been an uphill fisht. with little time for
the softer things cf life, and hero, the
stately rooms where the sunlight fil
tered through the small-paned win
dows to fall on faces of dead and gone
Marvins, the quaint wainscotted din
ing-room, with its time-stained treas
ures; the white table, with its glitter
of silver and glas3: the sweetness of
flowers and the two gentlewomen, so
different from all the women that he
had encountered in the rush of the city.
He decided, there and then, to_ linger
es long as he decently could, answer
ing abstractedly to the running fire *jf
bright nonsense that Jessica kept up.
He felt that somehow he had always
known that soft voice and rippling
laush.
At last she ventured: "You expected
to consult with 'Mr. Marvin* as to the
business for the coming season?"
Repplier pulled himself together and
came ont of the clouds. He had for
gotten his errand.
"Yes, 1 had. a .proposition to make
from our firm. You have been our
chief source of supply for several
months, and we have decided to offer
y.ou an interest, if you will agree to
work under our supervision."
Jessica drew a long breath.
Iteijpiler went to hits room that night
in a state of mind that battles descrip
tion, and lay for hours gazing out into
tho white night.
Morningâ the plantation bell sent its
summons far out In the misty gxayness.
Alas! ihe fields of Bois d'Arc had
passed to alien hands, but the old bell
still swung and lifted its voice, as It
had done when, in answer to' it3 call,
the dusky file went for ih from the gates
to toil for the master of iJoia d'Arc.
Somewhere, away off a chorus of
hounds responded, and fields began to
fill with the cotton pickers.
Jessica was seated behind the urn as
he sat down to Aunt Ailsa's hot waffles
and fried chicken. As he watched the
email, sun-browned hands among the
coffee cups the visions of the night
came back, full force.
Repplier had no excuse for prolong
ing his stay, but before Jessica drove
him down. to Aldana he managed to ex
tract an Invitation for the holidays
from Miss Rebecca. Repplier had
touched her strangely with his half
wistful remark: 'Christmas is an empty
word to me â I have never had a home."
Christmas eve, as Jessica came across
the yard from the office, Repplier met
her with such honest gladness in face
and voice that she forgot her scruples
and welcomed him as gladly. A long,
happy week, for Jessica, her guard once
down, threw herself into the spirit of
the hour. Repplier found his crumpled
roseleaf, however, in the person of
Charlie Carrington, who was Jessica'3
shadow. "Too confoundly cousinly,"
thought Repplier, as the swift days
flew. He had never cared for dancing*
but it was dull work .to stand in the
shadow while Jessica circled tho. room
in Charlie's arms. But at last the
round of dances and merrymaking
drew to a close. Repplier grew desper
ate; there was only, one day left to
him. If Miss Rebecca had earned his
gratitude before, she- now had his un
dying affection in the hour when she
pressed Charlie into service to drive
her to the next plantation.
It was one of those dreary, mid-win
ter afternoons, and the open fire flick
ered cheerily. Jessica, commenced - a
furious onslaught- with theft noker.
"Poking a fire is a positive stimulant
on a day like this."
'Is It? Let me try it" He took
the poker and knelt with her on the
broad hearth. 'A merry war of words.

He fell to wondering what sort of a
girl, this niece of Tapley's was like.
Probably she v/as old and more or less
of a barbarian; or perhaps she was the
sort who would say, "Oh, ain't that

lighten him as to Miss Parsons, but it
was scarcely worth while. She was
eorne quite impossible person, no doubt.
He handed Jock a cigar and-put the
whole" thing from his mind.:
It was gray twilight when they drove
up to the ranch house at the 4X. Tan
cred alighted and was" warmly 'wel
comed by Tapley.
"I don't care a snap of my fingers
what business it is that has brought
you,\ he said to Tancred. "You're to
stay just as Ions as you can stand 'it
with us, and a little longer, if you
have any charity for isolated old chaps

man in touch with things in the East
is a godsand here, sir. .Supper will be
ready shortly, and meanwhile Gertrude
trill give you some â  tea. Pardon me a
moment, and I'll hunt her up."
The room they had entered evidently
served as a library. Books lined the
walls: tempting chairs offered their
comfort, skin rugs covered the polished
fioor. It was quiet and in excellent
taste. Tanered's misgivings, about the
lady were somewhat mitigated.
At that moment Tapley returned.

met her on Broadway he would have
looked at her more than once, but find

them dared to break. Jessica gazed
deep into the heart of the firel but
llepplier's eyes were on the dark
curls â he could not see her face. As
he dropped the poker she stretched
out her hand â to find it caught and
held â "Jessica!" It was just a whis
per; but the rich color went over her
face, nnd the hand fluttered within
the strong grasp that held it prisoner,
as he went on. "I know it is too soon:
but I cannot go and leave my story
untold. You know that I have loved
you from the moment that I first saw
you. I believe that I have loved you

I believe that I have loved you always.

Outride the raindrops pattered
against the, long windows; then the
neigh of a liorse as Charlie and Mis?
Rebecca drove through the big gat*.
The brown head drooped lower, and
the hand in hia no longer struggled to
escape. Quick to grasp his vantage
ground he drew the slight figure to
him. For just the briefest time his'
lips sought hers: then flushed and
shy. Jessica retreated to the other end
of the ruff, as Miss Rebecca, standing
in the open door, read the end of the
chapter.
THE ROMANCE OF LAND MOVEMENTS
THE recent disasters in the West
Indies have naturally
widespread interest among geolo
gists as well as among the gen
eral public. Scientifically speak
ing, both volcanoes and earthquakes
rank themselves as part of a series of
phenomena to which the term "move
ments of the earth's crust" may be ap
plied; for it is an undoubted that
both actio-ns are intimately associated
with disturbances ' of that portion of
the earth which- we are accustomed to
term the habitable globe. Naturally
also earthquakes and volcanoes are
closely related for the reason that both
take their origin from the internal heat
of the earth, which, of course, is a rem
nant of the universal heat in which
our planet was â  born. There remains,
however, a certain series of phenomena
to which the term slow movements of
the earth's crust may. be applied. These
are sufficiently, interesting to warrant a
brief description of certain'of the more
prominent examples of such actions.
Slow Changes of the Earth's Surface.
If their occurrence may be described
as of much less obstrusive nature than
is the earthquake or the. volcano, their
reality is nevertheless" quite as strongly
marked. Practically the real difference
between the earthquake , and the slow
movements of the earth's crust is one
not of kind, but simply degree.
An earthquake, in other words, , will
effect in a moment changes of the
earth's crust which may require very
lengthened periods of time on the part
of the slow movements to bring about.
Nevertheless, it. is obvious that the
three phenomena themselves all Indi
cate to the geological mind' the great
fact that the apparently stable crust of
the earth Is really In a condition of
more or less constant alteration and
change.' In. some localities subsidence
is the prevailing feature,' while in
others elevation of the strata is noted
to take place. One very important pre
liminary consideration may here be
noted. Where man's observation has
long enough existed to convince him of
apparent, alteration In the relative
levels of land and sea, a question might
arise regarding the exact seat of the
phenomena he has noted. Popularly
speaking, it .would appear, at first" sight
very much more, reasonable to assert
that either a retirement or an invasion
of the sea would account for the altera
tion perceived : say 'on coast larids." ; fJL
little reflection, however/ will convince

us that the ocean may be considered in
the main to be a non-altering quantity.
A simple consideration will easily con
vince us of the truth of this remark.
The sea practically remains on the
same level. Therefore when an altera
tion is found to take place on a sea
coast, unless we are prepared to prove
that on the opposite shore a similar
alteration has taken place, and to the
same extent, we must set the burden
of .the.ehanse on the shoulders of the
land and not on those of the ocean.
Suppose, for example, what represents
an actual event, .namely, the case of
submerged forests, common enough*
round many of our own. coasts, and
also on those of other countries. Hare,
extending below low water mark/. we
flnu>the stumps of trees. It is obvious
that these must have grown on what
was once dry land. If we assume that
the forest was" In reality submerged by
the ocean, this -would necessitate our
supposing that a rise of if may be
twenty or thirty feet of sea took place,
this rise implying not merely a tidal
wave, but a permanent, alteration In
the sea level. Suppose that such- an
event took place say on the north coast
of the Enslish^ Channel, then if the
alteration were due to the sea's rise we
ought to be able to show that a similar
rise had taken place on "the French
Bide, seeing that water must always
maintain its own level. _
The Earth Changes â Xot the Sea.
Apart from the Impossibility of thus
accounting. for change in the apparent
level of land and sea, we have to reck
on the j immense additional -. body . of
water which would be required to ef
fect the change In question, j Thereiis
not a shadow of evidence to lead us to
suppose that any such material change
, In the bulk of our oceans is atall pos
sible. -Therefore 'we > are left with the
reasonable theory that the change rep
resented in s the : submerged forest < has
been due to v a partial and local sub
sidence of a part of the coast, carrying
the old forest gradually below the sur
face of the waves, "an faction continued
; slowly / and much disturbance
of the trunks of the trees themselves.
Assuming that the land is the seat
of these : slow â¢ movements and not the
! sea, â¢ we ; may proceed ; now to note , cer
â¢ tain'' interesting examples of 'suctf ac-
tions. Curiously enough we find Cel
sius, the great Swedish naturalist, giv
ing his opinion at the beginning of the
eighteenth century that the Baltic
Ocean and North Sea together were
gradually subsiding. He further insist
ed that as far as regards Sweden the
rate of the depression of the sea
amounted to about forty inches in 100
years. Referring to proofs in support
of his contention, he added that rocks
on the shores of the Baltic once exist
ing in the state of sunken reefs and
dangerous to navigators had gradually
appeared above the surface of the sea.
Also It was known that certain towns
which in former years had been sea
ports were now found inland, islands
also have been joined tq the main
land and fishing grounds rendered in
this way useless. 1
No doubt the remarks/af Celsius were
correct as -regards details, only he
erred in crediting the sea as the seat
of the changes in question. If to-day
we consult a map on which the coasts
said to be rising and sinking in the
world are figured forth, we discover
that while the western' coast of Nor
way and also the Swedish coast in the
Gulf of Bothnia may be said to exhibit
evidences of the rising mentioned by
this author, the most southerly part
of Sweden is' actually proved to be
at the present time subsiding. It
therefore must be clear that the
changes in question must be credited
to the land and not to the sea, seeing
that In coasts bordered by the same
body of water we have the double
movement represented. We find an ex
ample of a coast that has been elevated

hundred years at least, and probably
for a far longer period, the coast of
Greenland from Igallko to Disco Bay
has been sinking. The proofs of this
submergence have been found in the
fact that old buildings constructed on
low islands have been submerged and
the Greenlanders take care to build
their huts some distance from the
coast line. Another interesting proof
of this subsidence in Greenland is af
forded by the fact that some of the
earlier Moravian missionaries fixed
strong poles In the sea beach close to
the doors of their huts for the purpose
of mooring their boats. To-day these
poles are seen practically to hold their
places, but are far out at sea, the land
meanwhile having sunk and the sea
flowed in upon it.
The Italian coast, however, probably
furnishes us with more numerous and
*more distinct examples of these slow
movements of land within a compara
tively limited area than possibly any
other part of the earth's surface. There,
as indeed are also found elsewhere in
the world, marks of sea action on cliffs
are met with high above the present
level of the sea. Also there are found
in such situations the burrows in the
rocks made by shell fish whose natural
habit it Is to bore into stone and to
live In the burrows thus made. There
is a very interesting case of elevation
of the earth's crust found in the Ponza
Islands, situated off the coast of Italy.
Tlic Alteration in a Century.
It appears that the largest island of
this group is known as Palmarola. This
latter, area of land is well nigh spilt
in two by the hollow which exists In
a semi-circular form, sloping to the
beach and open to the west side. The
lowest part of this hollow contains
many large stones and bowlders. These
are seen to be marked with the re
mains of Serpulae tubes, these last be
ing the limy tubes made by, certain
sea worms for the purpose of protect
ing their bc-dics. They are familiar to
every person who has paid any atten
tion, whatever- to the animal life of the
sea side. In 1786 Dolomlen visited the
Ponza Islands. He describes Palmarola
as belnsr then divided into two parts
by a narrow canal or space of sea,
which he states v.*as of the dimensions
such as would allow a barge to pass
through it. This writer also construct
ed a man of these islands.. He shows
the canal clearly enough. It lies in
the position of the semi-circular de
pression already alluded to, this de
pression, as we have seen, being part of
the island itself and now above high
water mark. It is perfectly clear, then,
that slow, deration of Palmarola must
have taken place within relatively re
cent . times. The extent of land rise
represented la this locality Is stated by
modern authorities to equal about 200

The lines on his face dropped.
"None," he replied humbly.
"Well, I'm not!" she retorted, mora

a pause he spoke softly.
"My mother always said I'd be verr.
easy to manage."
"But you know she spoiled you. Too
-were her only boy. Personally, I
wouldn't try it if you were the last

She was almost sorry when she saw
his mouth tighten and the fine nervous
lines of his mouth grow deeper.
"That's a blow," he said with dry
lips. "Yet you told me once that I
had never failed you."
"In service â no."
"Only in little things, then?"
"They're what count with a woman."
"That's not reasonable. I'm abrupt
âdisagreeable at times, I guessâ but
you know quite Well that is only man

She gazed Into the light without re

"I have always thought," he began,
after a minute, "that marriage is a
partnership of equals, the capital
stock personal liberty, and, of course,
love and respect. Then, if the wife
wanted to do one thing and the hus

a Powerful Book
N some of the remote parts of
I Egypt the natives wishing to pre
11 pare the ground for the sowing
j[ scratch the soil to the depth of a
few inches with a pointed stick
<?ra\\n by an ox. After the most
difficult labor they succeed in turning
over the mere crust of the earth, leav
ing th.? black loam, rich with the pos
sibilities of life, untouched below. To
the assiduous reader it becomes mani
fest what a veritable scratching of the
soil the average present day novel if
vhen a book tfuch as "The Deliver
ance" falls into his hands. In nine nov
els out of ten the same shallow surface
fetrata of the conventional and the com
monplace is harried and haggled by
the little sticks of the little author peo
ple until it is scored and rescored by
lines absolutely parallel. To the good
of literature, however, there come at
Intervals writers who furrow deep into
the glebe and turn up the richness
which is beneath. Such a one is Ellen
Glasgow.
"The Deliverance" is a bo<jk of life.
It Is a book to study. Far from being
one of the ponderous Introspective
studies of a Henry James, or the
gloomy brooding* of an Ibsen, the
Btory is primarily one designed to be
interesting, yet there is so much of the
human Jieart in it, so true a grasp of
human problems, that after reading it
for pleasure one returns to read it for
profit. With ihe book not yet two
months from the presses 'it would be
extravagant to say that it is great, but
hindered by the lack of proper per
spective the reviewer may at least
venture the opinion that it is one of
the few superior books out of all the
recent tide of popular novels. It has
qualities, too. which are calculated tc
make it outlive many of these recent
things which come out between covers.
Like James Lane Allen with the
hemp and Frank Norris with the wheat
Mips Glasgow has chosen to make a
plant play its mysterious influence
throughout the taTeT Tobacco is the
dominant factor. As Norris in "The
Octopus"' makes the wheat growth play
a part in the plot almost allegorical so
does Ellen Glasgow skillfully weave the
baleful enchantment of the great weed
in and about until each of the charac
ters seems to be caught in the spell
from the preen leaves. The old tobac
co plantation of a great Virginian fam
ily that has= been brought low by the
rigors of the Civil War is the pivot
about which surge all the passions and
the impulses of the story.
The ta'e opens upon the efforts of
Dill Fletcher to get control of a bar
row bit Â«jf land, the last sliver of the
shrunken estate of the old Blake fam
ily. From the position of plantation
overseer for the Blakes before the war
Fletcher has rissn to opulence and by
treachery and by fraud has succeeded
in dispossessing the last of the Blakes
of Sjf the waving green acres save a
paltry lew whereon they dwell in
penury.
Christopher Blake, the only son of the
&Â«te-beilum owner of the plantation,
has? been forced down to the position of
a common field laborer upon the few
remaining acres that are his in order
that he may bring bread to the mouths
of his aged, paralytic mother, his two
sisters and a crippled veteran of the
lost cause, his uncle.
From the time when he tried to shoot
Fletcher with his sauirrel gun as a 12
year-old Christopher has possessed one
burning desire, and that, revenge upon
the man who had robbed him of his in
heritance and forced him down to the
level of a field hand. With every wak
ing moment this young giant, whose
blood is that of a long line of proud
ancestors, fans the flame of hatred in
his heart until the native brute within
him rises clamoring to the surface and
he stoops to a cowardly revenge. This
is no less than the debauching of youns
Will Fletcher, the only grandson of
the rascally overseer, upon whom all
the old man's hopes for a proud family
name arc established.
Hardly has the implacable Christopher
encompassed his ends only too surely
when a treat love for Fletcher's
granddaughter, which has for years
been combating all the hatred for th3
name in his heart, triumphs and there
follows the passionate endeavor to
right the wrong done to the grandson.
At last when the fires of the higher
purpose have burned out the dross
which clogged his eouI. Christopher ar
rives at "the great deliverance."
Christopher Blake is a remarkable
Study. With keen appreciation of the
effects of heredity and the sensitive
ness of a patrician soul Bfisa Glasgow
has portrayed the spirit of a gentle
born declassed. When forced down
among h:s tobacco plants to grub in
the soil this scion of the Blakes is al
most a savage at times, glorying in
(<ls unlettered boorlshness. but behind
this all remains to assert itself in rare
fitches the sterling worth that is inborn
and will not down. The author pict
ures with dynamic force the struggle
between these two natures which Is
stubbornly fought, until the refining
power of love comes to bring ths bet
ter to the fore. This character of a
man is as forceful a picture as life
Itself.
The touch of pathes in' the story is
supplied in the braye old Mrs. B!ake,
sightless, chained to inactivity by ill
ness, yet possessed of a sturdy faith
in the worth and beauty of life, which
is !Â»k^ a halo about her silvered head.
3*hiÂ» quaint old survivor of the past
regime, who believes in the darkness
of her sightless eyes that she is still the
mistress of 300 slaves, that her mansion
Is yet the open home cf hospitality and
her children enjoy the luxuries of the
old days, ls t sweet character enough
Â«o atone for the strain the author has
to make upon the credulity of her
readers in order that this situation
rcay Â»je accepted.
When tiiÂ« last page of this book is
tuned or.*Â» docs not feÂ»I so much that
he has. fceen reading: of life as that he
Iizb been reading life itself. The char
acters seem to be at the finger's touch,
their actions are vital, their souls are

cleverly hidden that it seems not a
romance, but an actuality that we are
viewing upon the screen of a printed

The Exploration
of the Great West
p^ OCKY MOUNTAIN EXPLO
4 4 \tD RATION," by Reuben Gold
1 \ Thwaltes, Is the latest volume
issued by Appleton & Co. in
their valuable "Expansion of the Re
public Series," and In every respect it
sustains the reputation gained by the
earlier volumes.
From the time of Balboa's crossing
the continental backbone in Darien to
the completion of the transcontinental
railroads some of the most wonderful
exploration feats ever accomplished
were carried cut in this country. Their
records fill, innumerable volumes,' many
of which .are as brimful of brilliant epi
sodes and- quite as entertaining as
any of the most thrilling romances.
Notwithstanding the abundance of
these exciting works dealing with the
trials and accomplishments of the no
ble army of pioneer heroes who opened
up the fertile Western districts of
America, we are often reproached with
knowing less r>t the history of the ex
ploits of the great pathfinders of our
own country than we know of the ex
plorations in remote regions like Asia
or Africa. Probably nothing has con
tributed to the comparatively general
lack of appreciation or want of knowl
edge of the performances of many of
the leading Western explorers than the
very abundance of the literature
their exploits have called forth and the
.consequent extensive study that is
necessary to gain a comprehensive
knowledge of their achievements.
Thwaites' aim has been to remove this
difficulty and to place within the reach
of the busiest reader a clear, concise
account of the main triumphs of the
most notable adventurer?, and by
short, luminous commentaries to show
how their discoveries formed such im
portant links in both the political and
economical development of America.
His work contains the, first general
summary of the history of Western ex
ploration that Las been published;
The author commences by referring
to the attempts to find a short Western
read to India and the Far East by the
hardy navigators of old S^aln. He then
briefly notices the conquest of Mexico
and the futile searches of the Spanish
ccnquisladores in the Northwest for
the "upper coasts of the South Sea," of
which Montezuraa had frequently told
them. Although they were baffled in
their attempts to discover a channel
leading from the Gulf of Mexico to the
Pacific, their hopes were continually
buoyed up by the enchanting stories
about the marvelous golden cities of
Cibola that were related to them by the
Indians. This led to the brilliant expe
ditions into the Painted Desert regions
of New Mexico and Arizona under the
guidance of Marcos de Nlza ana Coro
nado.
Thwaites then refers to the gallant
attempts of the French in Canada to
discover the northwest passage. In a
few pages he describes the wonderful
deeds of the Verendryes, father and
sons, and the adventures of some of
the early Canadian fur hunters. The
stirring acounts these Canadian ex
plorers gave* of the fertility of the
country they passed through and the
remarkable abundance of game and
fur-bearing; animals they met with at
tracted considerable attention in Eng
land and led to the formation of what
was the most powerful trading cor
poration of the day â the famous Hud
son Bay Company. This company was
formed in 1657 and had its charter be
stowed upon it by King Charles' II.
Among Its shareholders were many of
the most prominent men In England,
including the celebrated Prince Rupert
and the Duke of York. Charles granted
the company imperial rights to the
large terltory known as Prince Ruperts
Land and all the region drained by the
waters running into Hudson' Bay, the
Arctic and the North Pacific slopes. It
was to enjoy the "whole, entire and
only liberty and trade and traffic," as
their charter said, and to possess the
right to seize upon the property, and
persons of all competitors, British or
foreign; make and enforce law, admin
ister Justice, build and garrison forts,
maintain ships of war and exercise mil-
nary o nu uavai powerâ in short, it was
to assume absolute autocracy.
For a long period the company sternly
exercised Its powers. As a conse
quence it enjoyed a highly remunera
tive trade. But in its dealings with
the Indians, it must be said to its
crudlt, it was perfectly ju4t; its'com
mercial methods were strictly honor
able; and it invariably placed its af
fairs in the hands of high-minded dip
lomatic officials. In conformity with
thÂ«? general advancement .in political
affairs In England, this great corpora
tion surrendered its imperial powers
to- the British Government just two
centuries after its organization. It
has left an indelible record upon the
history of North American develop
ment. â 
Thwaltes attaches great importance
to the Louisiana purchase In 1803,
which doubled our territories, and as
Dr. T>\ .T Turner in n rÂ«Â»r<*>nt instructive
cssay aptly remarks, "gave birth to the
conception of space in American
ideals." "For," says he, "the Immen
sity of the area thus opened to ex
ploitation has continually stirred the
American*' imagination, fired their
energy and determination, strengthen
ed their ability to handle vast designs,
and made them measure their achieve
ments by the aeale of the Rocky Moun
tains and the Drairiee."
President Jefferson's exertions to stop
the encroachments <\f the English in
th<? northprn districts; his years of
patient plodding and bulldog,persever
ance, in his endeavors to get the Gov
ernment,to fit out a transcontinental
exploring expedition under the com
mand of military officials; his ultimate
success, which was followed by the
great triumphs of the Lewis and Clark
expedition are described at consider
able length.
. The final chapters are devoted to
the "Conquest of California," and the
exploits and adventures of General
Fremont and his famous guide, Kit
Carson. ;
Sain Weller once remarked after sev
eral times rereading a love-letter hÂ«
had written, that, he wished there was
more of it. Readers of "Rocky Moun
tain Exploitation" will experience a
somewhat similar desire before closing
the volume.

*AJ m an? Not since Don Caesar
dc Bazan has such an arrant
scamp and ragamuffin stalked his way
into literature with the fascinating im
pudence that is Said's. This turbaned
rip of old Damascus is bound to worm
his way into the Occidental heart as
easily as he forced the salaams from
the faithful in the Prophet's city.
"Said the Fisherman" is the work of
a new writer, Marmaduke Pickthall,
an Englishman, Like so many of his
confreres, Pickthall has gone "some
where east of Suez" .to find his story,
and, though It is old ground which he
plows over, the fruits are new and
strange to the taste. From the dirty,
repulsive Orient, the lying, swindling,
godless East, he has brought x story
which is remarkably good and he has
evolved a character new to fiction. It
is safe to say that "Said the Fisher
man" will take a ctrong hold on the
novel world? '
The author finds his hero contentedly
fishing with his few nets along the sea
shore, happy in the enjoyment of his
lentils t.nd oil at meal time and the
swinging couch in his fig tree when
the hot night comes on. But the chap-?
ter of Said's luck begins when hi3 false
friend Abdullah 3teals all of his
hoardings and cozens him into a hasty
flight toward the sacred city, Damas

a wife Hasneh loaded with; the house
hold belongings and he himself com
fortably disposed upon, the baok of a
mule. Said launches himself into the
hazardous world with "all to gain and
nothing to lose."
How Said finds his wife a useless
burden and leaves her upon the hospi

friends, how he suddenly finds himself
great in the eyes of his fellows through
virtue of a braid-embroidered
dressing gow-n stolen from a Christian
missionary, and how he finally arrives

Muslim are all Incarnate in Said. Cruel
he is and subtle as the serpent, yet at
all times possessed of such a frank
self-love and ingenuous belief in -his
own destiny that the reader pardons
his faults as being no more than the
endowment of his race. His strangely
poetic anathemas wherein the wealth,
the family,' the religion and general
well being of his enemies are consigned
to everlasting perdition bring a laugh
to the lips at every repetition. His su
preme self-assertlveness and the quality
of h'.s nerve make him qne of the most
diverting of villains. After ull it is
not Said's blacker nature that remains
to revolt the m!nd of the reader, but
the delicious 'quality of his knavery,
which is sparkling enough to cloak
the multitude of his sins.

who would like to have a footman and

For, as Professor Billaudeau says In
his foreword, "Our experience as a

the great difficulty in the study of lan

in the; judicious use. of the current

that their importation to â¢ America

their British instincts. Graham says:
'â¢Reduced to the simplest terms, the

this: The dry climate of extreme tem

Let such avail themselves of Foster's

In his Introduction the author very
wisely disclaims any power to be didac
tic. Very properly he says that no
game of cards can be machine made
and that his only endeavor is to work
out for the bridge player the ground
plan of strategy, leaving him to erect
his own partieular scheme of attack
and defense. Then he follows with an
elaborate outline of the game, an ex
position of the rules of leading, finess

cacies of the new sport, illustrating
everywhere by charts and tables. No
bridge expert could seek a more com

+y C. McCLURG & CO. are about
to publish one of the most val
j 1 â¢ 'iable and attractive nature
* books that has yet been issued
from the American press. On ac
count of the difficulties involved in
bringing out so elaborate a work and
the many features added to the original
plan its publication has been somewhat
delayed, but the changes causing the
delay will make the book all the more
valuable. The work is entitled "Birds
of California." It is written by Mrs.
Irene Grosvenor Wheelock. whose pre
vious volume. "Nestlings of Forest and
Marsh," will be remembered as a work
of rare charm and originality. Her new
book on the "Birds of California" has
many features that will commend it to
the naturalist, the tourist, the resident
of the great West and the nature lover
wherever he may be.
; It is announced that George W. Ja
cobs & Co. are about to publish in book
form the text of Thomas W. Broad
hurst's drama "The Holy City." which
was presented last year in some of the
larger cities and is to be brought out
simultaneously- next spring in New
York and San Francisco. It is very fit
ting that the text of such a play should
â be given to the public in book form;
the vital Interest of the theme, its pow
erful yet reverent treatment, its pro
foundly moving climax, all combine to
raise it above the ordinary drama and
to make it a passion, play of singular
power and beauty. Mr. Broadhurst has

character and one which inculcates in a
remarkable 'degree the lessons of the

It is seldom that a novel has begun
its serial appearance with such bril
liancy as that which attends Robert
Herrick's "The Common Lot." now
running in the Atlantic Monthly. Many
of the periodicals and reviews have
already taken occasion to comment
upon the significant fact that all the
four important serials now beginning
in American magazines are serious
and telling studies of American life as
It is; and they agree in finding Mr.
Herrick's story ' the young architect
with ideals practicing his profession
with a "commercial" firm In Chicago
not the" least powerful of 'them- The
editors of the Atlantic have intimated
that Mr. Herrick's plot has a singular
ly fatalistic foreshadowing In , the re
cent terrible catastrophe at the Iro-
qtiois i Theater in Chicago. While not
wishing to forestall the course of the
story, they intimate that its climax,
â¢written several months ago, tur%s
upon a tragical fire, Ihe result of tin
failure of builders to follow the hero's
architectural specifications â a failure
winked at by him for commercial rea
sons. This is a striking evidence of
the truth-telling and. as it were, pro
phetic power of fiction. >vl

been having an encounter with two
Italians of the organ grinding fratern

the whistling of one of the offenders

abominable persecution could not be

THE
KING
SAILS
tCopyright by Robert Earr.)
H1NG JAMES VI of Scotland, at
tempting an incognito ex
p'.cralicu of the Highland?,
together with his companion.
James McDonald, was ostensibly a
puost, l>ut practically a prisoner of
MacLeod, the Skye overlord.
"What's to be done?" asked tha
King.
MacDcnaid proposed that they
should repair Instantly to MacLeod
and demand of him conveyance and
safe conduct to the rainland.
"We scarcely can do that." demurr
ed the King, 'until we are sure that
detention is intended. Let us put ths
matter at once to practical test and
nee if we are prevented from leaving
the castle. If we are thea is the time
lor protest." , '.
Acting on this suggestion, the two
went outside and took the road by
which they had come. Theyjfound an
agile young gillie at ttierr heels before
Ibey were out of sight of Dunvegan.
"Why arc you following us'.*'* asked
MaeDonaid 'n Gaelic.
"I was told to wait on your lord
ehlp*," returned the man.
"We need no waiting on; turn
back."
But the gillie shook his shaggy, un
covered head and patiently trod in
their footsteps.
"Let us see how far he will follow,"
said the King as he strode on. The
gillie accompanied them for half an
hour or more without making any
protest, but at last he said to Mac-
Donald that he thought .it was time
to return.
"We are going through to the coast
we came from." replied MacDonald,
"and we do not intend to return."
At this the gillie drew from his belt
a short black tube and blew a few
ehrill notes. Up to that moment the
way had been clear, but now there
appeared over the hill in front of
them a dozen armed men. who ap
proached carelessly, as if they had
merely happened to be in the neigh
borhood or were journeying together
toward the castle.
"I think it is time to go back," sug
gested the gillie in a dull, uninterested
voice.
rl think it is myself," replied Mac-
Donald.
And so the futile excursion came to
an frnd.
Once more in tha cartle they were
confronted again by ihe questiun,
"What next?"
' "1 am certain." said the King, "that
if MacLeod is attempting to hold us
there is little use in making appeal to
him. and we have small chance of get
ting word to the fleet. I propose, then,
to coerce him. He was alone in his
study yesterday and he may be alone
there now. A sword's point at a min's
throat is an irresistible argument."
"But will he keep his word if he gives
it under distress?" objected MacDoa
ald.
"I think he will, but it is better not
to put too strong a temptation on him.
If we come on him alone we will make
him sign a pass for us. Then we will
gag and tic him securely, convey him.
when the way is clear, to this room.
-a here he will be less likely to be looked
for. We wi!l then give him the con
solation that if his pass proves useless
ire will return and finish the business
VÂ»y*Fendin& him into a less troublesome
world."
This advice was no sooner promul
gated than it was acted upon. The pair
traversed the corridors unseen until
they came to the door of the studv.
then, slipping out their swords they
entered quickly unannounced. TL-?
tight which confronted them was so un
expected t'nat. each stood there with
drawn sword in hand as if stricken Into
tione.
MacLeod was not in the room, but In
his stead, beside the wall of books, her
hand upraised, taking down a small
vellum-covered volume, was the most
beautiful young girl of psrhap3 nine
teen or twenty that either of them ever
had looked upon. The young woman
v.as the first of the three to recover
her composure. Relinquishing the book
to the shelf, the hand came down to
her side, and she said in most 'charm
ing liquid tones, but in broken English:
"You are looking for my father, per
haps?""
The King, ever gallant, swept his
hat from his head and bowed low. his
:Â»lertness of mind saving the situation,
for he answered quickly:
"Indeed, no, my lady. We thought
the room was empty, fo I implore you
to pardon our intrusion. We were
here yesterday and my friend and I
have just had a dispute regarding the
size of these gigantic tomes on the
lower shelf: my friend insisted that
they exceeded our sword blades in
length. Pardon me, madam." and the
King stepped briskly to the largest
hook, laying his sword down Its back
us If. in measurement.
'"There, Jamie," he cried. "I have
won the wager. I knew it was not
more than three-quarters the length
of 'my blade."
The glance of fear to which the
young woman had treated them de
parted from her fnee and she smiled
fclijrhtly at the young man's eagerness.
"I gather from your remark," he
said, "that you are Miss MacLeod of
Dunvegan. May I introduce my friend,
James MacDonrfd of Sleat. My own
name is Jan-.es Stuart, r.nd for a time
v.e are your fathers guests at Dun
vegan."
The young lady with inimitable
Enice bowed her queenly head to each
of them in turn. The men slipped
their swords quietly back into their
sea bbards.
"I give you good welcome to Dun
vegun." said the girl. "I regret that
I do not ppeak fair the English."
"Indeed, my lady," rejoined the sus
ceptible King, "it is the most charm
ing English 1 ever heard."
The fair stranger laughed in low
and most melodious cadence, like a
distant cathedral's chime falling on
th** evening air.
"I shall be delighted to be your
teacher." replied the King with his
most courteous intonation.
"It is perhaps that you- already speak
the Gaelic?" suggested the young wo
man. RB&5
"Alas: no. madam. But I should be
overje-yed to learn, end it may bu you
will accept me in the part of pupil. You
will find me a devoted and most obedi
ent scholar."
A puzzled expression troubled the
face of the girl as ehe endeavored to
follow the Â«-ommunication addrersed to
her. but MacDonald sprang somewhat
eagerly t<Â» the rescue and delivered a
long harangue In her native language.
'Her delight was Instant. th3 cloud on
her brow disappearing as if by magic
under the genial Influence of the accus
tomed converse. The King's physiog
nomy-oIbo underwent a change, but
the transformation was not so pleasing
ss that which had illumined the coun
tenance of the girl.
The tension of the. situation was
changed, rather than relieved, by the
siicnt opening of the door, and the
pause, of McLccd himself on the
threshold.: rasing dubiously at the
.group before him. The" animation of
the girl fell from her â¢ the moment
f-he beheld her father, and the
yonrrr men. turning, were confronted
by the gloomy features of the chief
tain. The MacLeod closed the door
softly and, without a ward, walked to
his chair beside the table. The girl,
bowing: slightly, with visible restraint,
quitted the room, and as she did so
MacDonald's alertness again proved
his friend, for he tiptoed quickly to
the door, before the King, accustomed
t<r be wcited upon rather than wait
ing, recollected himself, and held .it
open fc-r the lady, making a gallant
sweep with his bonnet as she passed
out.
When the supple young man re
turned to his place beside the King
he said in a whisper:
"Xo sword's point play with , tha
father of such a beauty, eh?" â¢
To this remark his Majesty made no
reply, but said rather- gruffly and ab
ruptly to his host:
"Do you hold us prisoners In this cas
tle, sir?"' â¢ . â 
' "That will depend on the answers I
pet from yc-u," replied the MacLeod
slowly.
"Are you two. cr either of you, emis
saries of , the King?"
"We are not."
'"Does the King know you are here?"
"Regarding the King, his knowledge
or his doing?, you had better address
your Inquiries to him pertonally. 1 '
"You are merely two private gentle
men, then, come all this distance to
satisfy a love of travel and a taste
for Fcenery?"
"You have stated the case with great
accuracy, sir." i
"Yesterday you spoke of my lack of
manners in failing to ask you to be
seated. I shall now refer to a breach
of politeness on your own part. It is
customary when strangers visit a,
province under an acknowledged ruler
that they should make a formal call
upon the ruler before betaking them
selves to other portions of his terri
tory. You remained for several days
in. Skye without taking the trouble to
inform me of your arrival."
"Sir." replied James haughtily. "I
dispute your contention entirely. You
are net the rufer of Skye."
"Who is, then'.'"'
"The King of Scotland, of course."
The ilacLood lsughed in a fashion
that somewhat resembled the snarl of
an angry dog.
"Of course as you say. No one dis
putes that James is King of all Scot
lard, and I would be the lost to ques
tion his right, because I" hold my lands
under charter boaring: Â« his. signature,
carrying the great seal of the kingdom:
nevertheless*, the MacLeods held Skye .
long before the present 'royal family of '
Scotland were heard of. and I would
have been MacLeod oT MacLeod al
thoujrh James had never put his hand
to tins parchment. Meanwhile. I take
the rlFk cf detaining you until I learn
more about you. and if the King makes
objection I rhall apoiogfre."
"You will apologize,"- . said James
sternly. "I say that you .will apologize,
not by writing at yourfcase In Dunve
gan Castle, but 'on your bended knees
at Stirling." ' -;
"That's as ma: 1 be," said'the McLeod
Indifferently, and it was quite obvious
that he remained unmoved* by the
threat. "Gentlemen, I have the honor
to wish you good-morning."
"One moment. Are we then to con
sider ourselves prisoners?"
"You may consider yourselves what
ever best :i!eas?es you. If. each gives me
his word of honor that he will make no
attempt at escape, and also that he
will not communicate with Stirling,
then you are as free of my house and
my grounds as If you were the most
welcome of guests. But I warn rou
that if, when you pass your words, you
attempt to tamper with any of my men
I shall know of it very soon, and then
comes the dungeon." ' ' â¢ -
"What do you say, MacDonald?" in
quired the King sharply.
MacDonald recovered himself with a
start. "To what?" he asked.
"To the terms proposed by our jail
er." . ' * - - '
"I did not hear them; what are
they?" : :f^j
"Will you give your word not to es
cape?" -V
"Oh. willingly."
"And not to communicate with Stir
ling?"
"I don't care if I never see Stirling
again." Â«
The King turned to the chief. "There
Is little difficulty, you see," he said,
"with your fellow Highlander. I, how
ever, am supposed to be a Lowlander,

word not to communicate with Stirling:
As for the other proviso, I amend it as
follows: I shall not leave this island
without your knowledge and your com
pany. If that is . satisfactory, I pledge
my faith." -. * â  '
"Perfectly satisfactory." : answered
MacLeod, and "with that 'the two young
men took- their departure.
Once more in the King's room, from

out so confidently. MacDonald flung
himself upon a bench, but, the King
paced up and down ths apartment.*, '

Highlander, "a roan plays for hte own

The King stopped abruptly In hbv
walk. "Why . do you call me by that
name?"
"Merely to show that in this play the
royal prerogative is, not brought into
play; It is already settled that when I:
meet. the King I am defeated.- It re
mains to be seen what luck James Mac-
Donald has in a contest with ; plain
James Stuart.'l
"Oh. it's to be a contest, then?"
"Not unless you . wish it so. â  I am

"Ah, we'll see about tha^t, Jamie." " 1
' "We will.-Ballengeich," said MacDon
ald with confident precision.
The girl was at firsts equally charm
ing to each. The. serious Highlander,
not. less manly and. handsome than his
competitor, was gifted with an im
measurable advantage in his familiar- .
ity with every phase . and inflection â¢ of â¢
his native vernacular. In his despair,
the King struck up a close friendship

the King saw, too late, the futility of
his endeavor.. He had came to the con
clusion that his uninteresting rambles
with Donald were not likely to further
his quest, and was sitting in hi3 room
cogitating .UDon some new- method of
attack when MacDonald, burst into the
apartment with radiant face. The
King looked up at his visitor with .no
great good nature, and said sharply:
"Well, what is it?" : - :; --'--if. : >
"Your Majesty,"., cried MacDonald,
jubilantly. "I -think I^have found a
method, of escape, and that .without in
any way impugning our pledges."
. "Oh, is that all," said the King, with
the air of snubbing , too enthusiastic, a
courtier. - "I thought, the house was
on fire."- { . :. .* ' -
' â "'â¢ And I- thought, your Majesty," re
turned Maepbnald, "that this subject
wasevfer uppermost in your mind."
..The King rested hlsjdosed -fist'on his
hip.Meaned his' head. "a ; little- to one side

, "I dc; not" understand you." ' '
"It is to make myself understood, that
I have come so hurriedly. I, beg, s then,
to inform your Majesty that Miss Mac-
Leod has consented, to t become my wife.
I have spoken " to' her; f ather, : who; has
somewhat grudgingly and conditional
ly, given his ' consent. '. 1 It .occurred Â° ; to
me that if I wedded the daughter of
your jailer I may have enough influ
ence with the family to secure your
Majesty's release."
"I have no doubt," said the King,
"that this was your object from the
beginning. And so you have exchanged
a temporary jailer for one that will last
you all your life."
The Highlander knit his brow and
compressed his lips, as if to hold back,
some retort which : later he might re
gret. There was a moment's con
strained silence, then the King flung
off his. ill humor as If it were a cloak.
"Forgive ;fne,c! Jamie,", he cried,
springing to' his -feet. â  "Forgive the
wounded vanity of the .vanquished."
He extended his hand impetuously,
which the other grasped with eager
cordiality.
; ' "Jamie, ray lad. you were right.
The crown weighs heavy, when it is
thrown into the scale, but'with.'this
lassie I, well believe it would have made
not an ounce of- difference. Let the
best man win, say I, and you're the
victor, eo you have my warmest con
gratulation. Still, Jamie, you must
adm't that the Gaelic-Is. the cursedest
lingo ever a poor lowland-bred man
tried to get his tongue around. So,
now. you see, Jamie, we are even
again. You think the crown defeated
you at Stirling-, and I hold the lan
guage defeated ' me , : in Skye ; thus we
are '.both j able to retain a good opinion
6r 'ourselves, which is. the splendid
privilege of every Scotchman, to hold.
â¢Your bravery 'deserves success, for it
"requires some courage to face your fu
ture father-in-law. What did the old
curmudgeon say?!'
; : "He , gave little indication . of pleas
ure or the reverse'. â . He offered me ray
liberty, now /that I had pledged it \ in
another direction,' but .he refused to
release you, sol declined to accept hi3
clemency." .'â¢ â¢ -' - *
' "Not. so. ; I have a more immediate
; and j practical remedy. ' You have not
forgotten the twenty-six-oared barge
; which the MacLeod was to keen for the
â -â¢.â >:â â ;â  â  â  - ' . â 
Kingr, and which Ualcolm MacLeod
built for him."
"It is not very likely, when I issued
a proclam'ation commending Malcolm
as the greatest shipbuilder ' in the
â world." "
"Well, Malcolm has arrived at Dun
vegan to receive into his own hands
once more that same proclamation.
I asked him. in MacLeod's presence,
if the fleet still lingered in Torridon
Bay, and he answered that It did.
MacLeod pricked up his ears at this
and thinking that he was to get some
information, nov; that I proposed my
self as a. member of his family, in
quired if I knew why It remained so
.long. -I said I had a suspicion of the
catme." If Malcolm had not replied to
the King's proclamation it was nat
ural that the fleet would wait until he
did. Old Alexander and Malcolm
. seemed surprised that a response was
expected, Malcolm being but a simple
yeoman. However.', he wrote out a
courteous reply to the King,- in Gaelic,
and Malcolm^is to send it to the fleet
as soon .as he returns to the northern
coast."
"I don't see how that is to" help us."
demurred his Majesty. V
"Here is my proposal. If you will
nov/ write out an order to the admiral
commanding the fleet to appear before
Dunvegan castle. I will ride part- of
the. way home with Malcolm and sug
gest to him at parting that perhaps
none. of the officers of the fleet under
stand Gaelic/ or at Iea3t that none. can
read it, so; I will fasten your letter to
the other document and tell Malcolm
it is a translation of his Gaelic effu
sion. Neither Malcolm nor any of his
friends at the port can read English
and as he is a simple-minded man It
is "not likely that he will return and
allow the laird a perusal. So In that
way we may get word to the fleet.
Even if the letter. . Is discovered you
will have kept your word, for you
promised / only no t â¢ ta communicate
with* Stirling."
The King pronounced the device a
feasible one and set himself at oncÂ« to
the writing of the letter.
Two or three days later there was a
commotion in the castle. The guards
on the western headlands reported the
approach of numerous ships, and by
and by from the castle wall itself tha
fleet could be seen sailing slowly up
Loch Follart. For the first time since
they had known him. lines of deep
anxiety marked the frowning brow of
MacLeod as he stood gazing a,t thÂ« ap
proaching vessels. Here were visitor*
who, if they proved not to his liking,
he could scarcely threaten with thÂ«
dungeons of Dun vegan.
"What do you make of this Mju>
r>onald?l*j,sald the chieftain, turning
to his future son-in-law, as If already
he looked to him for support and coon
â el. * -V -"â¢â¢
But MacDonald shook his head, ta
spite of the fact that his wife who-wuÂ»
to-be stood very close to him. '.
"All negotiations have been carried
on by my friend here, and so to him X !
must refer you."
MacLeod could restrain his impa
tience no longer, so without glaneln* at
his visitor he said:
"Perhaps you. sir. can tell mÂ«- 12Â»
purport of all this display."
"Assuredly." answered tha Kins wfih
a trace of sternness In his ton* that had
hitherto been absent in his convert*
with his Jailer. "The fleet comes at thÂ«
command of the KUj to take away
your prisoners, if they are unharmed.
or to batter down your castle if thay
have been molested."
"I suppose then I should be thankful
they are unharmed?"
"You have reason." said the Kin*
fhortly. - :^
"His Majesty must set great valua on
your heads if he sends his whola fle*t
to succor you."
"He does."
"How did he know you were here 11
you did not break your parole and com
municate -with Stirling?"
"The King knows there is more go
ing on in Skye than the making of
strong drink. I did not break my pa
role, neither did MacDonald."
"In spite of what you said to me, you
must have told the KIr.pr before you
left Stirling where you were going."
"I did not."
"Then word must have been brought
to him from Skye?"
. "It was not."
"In that case the only conclusion I
can come to Is that th3 King Is un
aware of your presence here."
"He Is well aware of it."
"You denied being a friend of tha
King," persisted MacLeod, . "and said
you were but a small farmer near
Stirling."
"I deny yet that I nnva friend of
the King. On the contrary, J don't
mind confessing to you that I am tha
greatest enemy he has In the world,
and lt*3 well he knows it." ;â¢ " ;â¢ ';-,
"You amaze me. Then you do not
wish to meet the fleet?"
"On the contrary, I do, and I ask
you to order a suitable boat for me."
"You shall have the best boat in my
possession." said MacLeod, leaving
them for a moment to give his com
mand.
. In a short time a large boat with
ten oarsmen was waiting.
"They are ready for you." said M* y-
Leod -with an effort p.t gcnialty. which
gave a most sinister effect to his (ace.
"I am sorry to bid you gocd-by. but X
hope you bear av.'ay with j*ou no 111
will against Dunvcgan."
"Sir." said the King, ignoring hla
compliments, "that boat will not do
for me."
"It is* the best I have." said Slao-
Leod, looking: at his truculent guest
with new anxiety.
f"The boat you must brir.g to thÂ«
landing Is the twenty-six oared barga.
which Malcolm MacLeod bulldtfd so
well."
Tha- MacLeod stepped back two
paces. "That boat Is for ths King."
he said in a voice scarcely abovs %
whisper.
"Yes. it Is for the Kins, therefore
the King demands it. Give the order
Instantly that it be brought to thÂ«
landing, well manned with twenty-six
rowers."
All color left MacLeod's face. His
next word3 were to MacDonald. . "Is
this true?" he said.
"Yes," answered MacDonald, "it la
true."
The girl, her wide eyes distended
with fear, clutched the arm of her
lover. Even she knew this was a case
for the headsman, but SLaeLcod, with
not a quiver in his voice, called down
to his followers:
"Bring round the barge and
see it Is well manned. I myself will
take the rudder."
The stern face of the 'Kins relaxed
as he saw this chieftain stand stralght
er than ever before sincr he had known
him, ready to take on 'uis head what
ever misht befaM.
The girl impetuously Tung herself at
the Klns'3 feet, and in her excitement
forgetting the limitations of his learn
ing, she poured . forth a plea for her
father In Gaelic. The King smiled as
he stooped and raised the suppliant.
"My dear." he said. "I shall never
hear that language without thinking
of you and my own discomfiture. If it
were not that MacDonald stands there
with that dour Highland look on his
face Jt Is I would kneel at your feet.
Your father is to come with me to
Stirling, for I have said he should, and
I must kesp my word with myself as
well as I have kept it with him. Do
not draw away your hand. In spite of
MacDonald's scowls, for I have this to
promise you. If you and he will ac
company us to Stirling. I pledge to you
the King's word that I shall grant you
whatever you ask. " i-o you see you
need have no fear for your father's
safety." Saying this, the Kins, with
that courtly manner which so well be
came him. gave the hand of the girl
into that of MacDonald.
Thus it came about that the Mac-
Leod took a voyage he had not Intend

that he long outlived the man who war

assisted very materially in making his
name illustrious.
Martha Washington had one great
grief in her early married life, a grief
which followed her into the White
House and against which she struggled
to the end. Yet this grief was almost
trivisl, or would teem so in these days.
It arose from the reverence which
the early colonists pcid her. No sooner
had "The Father of His Country" at
tained eminence than Martha Wash
ington received the title of "Lady"
Washington. And as such she was
characterized in the newspapers of the
day and in private life. The Father
of His Country, who was an earnest
commoner, would not permit the use
of the title. And against it Martha
Washington alsÂ«> argued. But it was
applied to her and then it stuck.
In some private letters owned by an
nld Virginian family there is this para
graph written by a matron of the 1785
days: "If only you could see our dear
Mrs. Washington. Sl.o will not let us
call her Lady Washington. Indeed she
rose from the eaters and the tea In great
dudgeon thÂ«* other day because a gen
tleman would insist upon so calling her.
Her manner is very dignified and she
does no talking that Js not necessary."
If there is one action above all oth
ers for which the women of America
can feel proud it is the preservation of
the borne of Washington. How Mount
Vernon was saved as a monument to
patriotism is an interesting story, for
it was through the formation of the
oldert patriotic association of women
r.ow in existence in the United States
that this historic spot was preserved to
posterity.
Upon the death of George Washing
ton, in I7D9. a lif<? interest in the estate
imvFfl to his wlic From her it fell lo
various Wafhir.gton relati\-es until, in
ISSS, John Augustine Washington. Jr.
found hinvf-lf in possession of an his
toric place which he was unable to keep
in a proper state of repair. With the
<cr.ecnt ot his family he endeavored to
â¢fffect its permanent preservation by
celling U to the Cnlted States Govern
ment, and failing in this offered it t<>
the commonwealth of Virginia. It y'as
at this erisi? that Ann Pamela Cun
ningham of Sonth Carolina determined
that the tomb of Washington must be
prrfserred as a permanent shrine of pa
tiiotism.
Accordingly *he organized the Mount
Vnncn Ladies' Ausociation and ap
pointed vice regents in the various
Â£tai*s to aid in the work. Contribu
tions to R fnnd to buy the property

the country became interested. Thou
sands of school children gave pennies.
Edward Everett presented the immense
proceeds of his lecture on "Washing

Mount Vernon was saved to the nation.

cluding the wharf, tomb and mansion,
were purchased by the association for
$200,000. As the society was formed for
the sole purpose of acquiring Mount
Vernon. the estate can never pass from
its. possession, and is owned by it,
though Virginia retains a supervision
over it. Since Miss Cunningham's death
the office of regent has passed through
various hands until to-day It Is held by
Mrs. Justine Van Rensselaer Townsend

The Englishman looked puzzled.
"Were they anyâ any relation to each

In Washington there la a lovely
home, not far from the White House,

,upon a corner bracket and a spinnet

/JÂ» j a woman attired in a very
>^S dashing frown of russet
brown, just in the process of making.
"Then* an* two shoulder capes; will
you have a third?" replied the modiste.
Harding with the folds of cloth in her
hard.
Madame paused and surveyed hcr
?Hf critically in the glass. "Yes. add a
third, but let it be a stole cape with
embroidered ends that hang to the
belt."
The modiste nodded and for a few
minutes there was no sound but the
snipping of the cloth and the soft lay
ing of the folds that were to make the
shoulder tapes and the stoles of a
handsome cloth suit for Easter days.
KuFset brown cloth very glossy
makes a beautiful spring suit. The
Ekiit. which must be full, can be fitted
around the hips and laid in box plaits
all the way around from the knees to
the floor. This gives a very full skirt.
The uppÂ«r part of the skirt, the part
around the hips, is trimmed with black
embroidery which roaches downward
in embroidered points.
The orafst has the great hanging
â Jeeves which end in the long tight
< uff, wblch is trimmed with cmbroid
fiy. ir>d all the tapes have a little of
the same embroidery upon them, as do
the stole ends.
A suit like this is as charming a
thing as one would want to see. and.
if made of cloth that is not too heav>,
H can be worn all the spring and again
in the fall.
Trie utility of the spring suit can best
be explained by a remark made by a
fa&hionable woman who was out se
lecting her Baxter gown.
"V.'hen I buy a spring suit," said she,
*I have three ideas In mind. The suit
must be warm enough to wear in April
and May. It must be fashionably
made and it must be of a color that
will not fade nor spot. It must not be a
rlelicate goods, but rather a material
that stands the weather nicely.
â¢This cult," continued she, "I expect
to wear two months. Then I shall lay
it away. I^ater in the season I "will
Ijring it out and., after refreshing it a
little, I shall wear it for a traveling
dress. This can be done by the removal
of any lace that may be upon it and by
the taking off of one of the shoulder
capes or the putting in of a new vest.
â¢This same suit does nicely for first
fall wear. And now the lace is put back
on. the gown is made smart with choux
of ribbon and it is worn with a very
showy little autumn hatâ one of those
hats that bloom brightest In the fall

The Shoulders of the Gowns.
A man, dressmaker stood looking into
the window of a fashionable .depart
ment stcre where tailored gowns were
6old. 'I despair," said he, "of making
gowns ahead of the season to suit my
patrons. No sooner does a style come
in than another one follows and chases
it out. Just look," said he, "how the
Ehoulders of the dresses have been
changed within three months, and now
the gowns which I made just befor*
Christmas are all out of date. Many of
them are positively Gothic by the side
of the new styles."
The truth of his statement was evi
dent at a glance, for the new gowns
which stood so gayly forth on the wax
en models were laden as to the shoula
ers and remarkable as to the sleeves,,
The shoulders were all built on the
6loping order, and in many cases the
slope was continued by some clever art
until it actually reached the elbow line,
there to become lost in the voluminous
folds and puffs of the lower sleeve. '
In many cases the shoulder droop Is
managed by means of capes,, either of
cloth or of lace, while in other in
stances it is achieved in other ways.
Lady Curzon is wearing a new gown,
which might bewailed a visiting gown,
and which could be easily converted
Into an afternoon dress. It is built of
mole colored cloth, and it is made upon
the shirt waist pattern, baggy In the
front and 'secured with great jeweled
frogs that strap it across the front and
shut it in very picturesque fashion. At
the neck there is a large jeweled clasp.
The .feature of this , gown is its
sleeve, which is cut off at the shoulder.:
The shoulder, is finished with a band of
Armenian embroidery about two 'fin
gers wide. Then there comes a sleeve
of cloth, cut off at the elbow, and fin-*
ished with another band of embroidery.
And below this there is a heavy, white,
lace undersleeve which terminates in a
'â handsome -ruffle around the hand.'.

down the front with the smallest or
gold buttons. And the yoke is one mass
of shirring, which is brought down to
a point over the bust. 'Between " the
rows of shirring there are strappings of
white. satin ribbon.'
The 'stock of this 'gown is made of
lace, which is fitted to the neck and
throat, and is stiffly wired to keqp it in
place. The cuffs are deep cuffs and are
also stiffly, wired. These are set out
over the hand in a bell. This waist is.
all crimson, even the lace being dyed
that color.
The new gowns are full of new . fea
tures and one cannot look at them an
instant | without being impressed -with
their, oddity. They are trimmed in cu
rious ways, and they are treated with
plaits and applications which are en
tirely, different from all the trimmings
of' other seasons. '"' .
In the long list of striking features
the cuffs can be mentioned as among
the most prominent. These have quite
outgrown the modesty of previous sea
sons and are effective in
the large sizes and ; very 'chic in the
smaller and tighter styles. â¢
: A , handsome I cuff was seen upon ; a
gown worn by Mrs. â  Groyer Cleveland,
who is In deep mourning, f or ' her
ter. * This , cuff, Vwhich ! was â  made .,; of
black henrletta, -was ,iveryJ"i stiff and
about two fingers in width! It was large
around and was Interlined so that It
could be neither folded nor bent. It
might as well have been wired. It was
un trimmed except for, a band of hen
rietta. This cuff completed a .very full
sleeve of the black goods.
A handsome cuff ; was worn by . Mrs.
.Roosevelt. .The, gown was ! a/ checked
silk in black and white, and the sleeves
were full â "'and of the . :.. variety .;- which
gradually \ grows fuller toward ; the
wrist. At the wrist '.; the ; cuff was slit
Doldly and sharply and the slit was
filled in with a very deep fall of lace,
which trailed two fingers deep upon
the gown.
A Few of the^ Prettiest Gowns.
Miss Alice Roosevelt at the same time
wore an afternoon gown with cuffs of
lace almost as deep as the elbow and
very tight. The . lace came down to a
point over the- knuckles, and from
shoulder to thumb there was one very
pronounced and very beautiful sweep.
The bagglness of the sleeve all occurred
on; the under part, 'where the sleeve
hung down in a great fullness of cloth.
And there is still another cuff that is
gaining in favor, and this! is; the long,
tight, plain clothcuff, with; the bell at
the : wrist. This is | skin-tight over the
hand and knuckles and is tight to the
very elbow. Above this there is a full
ness which falls down and forward.
This sleeve is tight at the shoulder.
The. sensation of the Paris season is
the Melba Bleeve, which is, a sleeve ,
made of thin j material over a \ heavier
' one. This sleeve when used In an even
ing gown can be made of mousseline de
sole over black " taffeta." But if made
of a heavier goods it* needs no lining.
It is very effective made, of moire, and
Is good in a cloth gown. ,.
:; The Melba sleeve is very long. ; At
the- wrist it has a smart embroidered
cuff very -wide and very stiff and turn
ed back smartly from the hand into a
wide flare. . - ,
The sleeve proper is so full as to re
semble a pillow case. The arm is en
veloped in it and it lies in great folds
all around the elbow, falling forward
over the cuff. The top of this sleeve
, is very tight arid; actually hugs, the
arm. being of thÂ«\ variety/ known as
â skin tight. - ; : ;, --. â  &a^
-i Then . there . Is another sleeve, g and
this is the sleeve whlcli terminates a
little below the elbow In a wide ruf
fle. This is lined- with a ruffle of chif
fon and this in turn with a ruffle of
lace,' then more chiffon, and so on un
til the sleeve is filled in. It falls
around the hand in one great cas
cade. â¢ ;
Sleeves are made by puffing the ma
terial below the elbow. Then comes
a great series of ruffles that fall .right
down to the very wrist. These are
made of many kinds of lace, of tulle,
.:. of chiffon and of other materials, un
til the. arms are exquisitely covered.
Nothing prettier than thfs sjeeve could
possibly.be imagined.
Some of the Comins Skirts.
"*Â£ There, are skirts that are too hand
some to be ignored in the chronicles
of fashion, where skirts are to be
mentioned. A lovely skirt Is one that
trails well upon the ground and is
trimmed with a deep, ilounce-like ar
rangement. The best skirts are not
flounced, but are cut so that the lower
part flares like a flounce.
Again, the skirt is box plaited half
way down with the bos plaits inverted
and with the fullness all lying in these
plaits. Skirts of this kind should be
made very long to give that exquisite
feminine height that is so much de
sired by both men and women.
A great deal Is being done to make
woman, fair woman, seem tall. Not
only? are skirts very long indeed, but
they are trimmed in such a way as to
seem still longer. The new skirts are
of four lengths, and it seems almost es
sential that a woman should have at
least one skirt made in every one of
the four different lengths.
The longest skirt is the prettiest, be
cause the most graceful and the most
feminine. This skirt is fitted to the hipa
and is "tried on" the wearer in a pecu
â¢ liar fashion. She is stood on a thick
book, or upon a low footstool, and the
skirt Is turned up just even with the
ground in front and at the sides. But
at the sides It begins to grow longer,
and in the back It Is cut to a very long
sweep, the longer the better. This is
the ideal dinner and reception length.
The nest length is fitted while a wo
man stands upon a thin book. The
skirt is turned up even with the grouud
f and is gradually lengthen'** into" a
train until it sweeps off at the back
into a very respectable length. This is
worn for calling, and for very nice
street wear. It is ths skirt that Mr&.
Paget and other Londqn women select
for doing the bazaars and shows of the
season.
Then come two other skirts, the shop
ping skirt, which just touches, or rather
just escapes, the ground; and the skirt
that Is cut from one to two inches from"
the ground, namely, the instep skirt.
These four lengths make the skirts of
the season.
The Graceful Foot Flounces.
"How can I manage to be stylish?"
queried a woman of her man dress
maker; "I am too short and then there
is something too severe about nay
gowns."
As she spoke she brought forth a
-really lovely; dinner creation in absinthe
green crepe de chine trimmed with to
mato colored lace dyed to a brilliant
red. The gown was cut rounding in the
neck and was finished with a .very deep
and very, scalloped collar of lace. This
fell over v the bust, which was trimmed
with wide ruffles of crepe de chine. The
, sleeves .were masses of crepe de "chine
ruffle and lace.
The skirt was one of those tucked
affairs, with all the tucks turned in at
the hips. '> The front was plain. Deep
rows of ; ruffles and shirring trimmed
the skirt. 'There were three of these
and around the foot there was another
deep ruffle, with shirring at the head
and a fall of lace. The whole was
quite a triumph in brilliant simplicity.
Yet it was not becoming.
The man dressmaker studied It ; a"
minute in silence. Then bringing out
a lace flounce, he said: "Madam, let
me add this. You need a touch of
French chic to that gown."
The lace flounce, which was Inex
pensive, was lined with mousseline and
this lining was made heavier by a
flounce of taffeta. The whole was set
upon the foot of the gown until it lay
. upon the â¢ floor in one lovely cascade.
Its effect was Instantaneous. It made
the wearer a great deal taller and it
also added to her elegance, giving her
that indescribably feminine looK,
which Is created by trailing robes, to
whose influence no eye, be it mas
culine or feminine, can be insensible.
Will tlw; Skirts Grow Fuller?
The question of whether "the skirts
will grow fuller i<? one that is being
continually agitated, .with many argu
ments both ways. It looks from B
critical study of the fashions as though
woman had affected a pretty compro
mise. It looks as though she had
managed to make her skirts fuller
without- sacrificing her figure and no
woman wants to sacrifice her figure.
There is no doubt that the skirts of
the previous century did make a
woman appear fuller and even the
more modified skirts of the last hun
dred years had that tendency. The ex
ceptions were the skirts that came in
during the last few years, the eel skin
skirt, the umbrella skirt, which was
full only below the knees, and tha
skirt which clung all the way down.
*,*ith scarcely any fullness at all until
it cascaded around the feet.
The skirts of to-day are much fuller
than the skirts of the past few years,
yet one would hesitate to call them
voluminous skirts. There is one spe
cially which is delightfully planned
full, yet not too full, and quite cling
ing in spite of the fact of its fullness.
This skirt is trimmed with three deep
flounces of the same cloth with each
flounce finished with a band of satin
ribbon. There Is nothing dressy, yet
the effect is elegant.
Another skirt is very full, with the
plaits turr.ed under at each seam and
stitched flat. Suddenly there is a flare,
the wide plaits are released and the
skirt falls in great soft folds.
It is as a rule the silks that can be
managed best. These can be tucked,
shirred or plaited around the hips,
without adding to the size of tha waist
or hips and without making the figure
awkward. The thin novelty clotha, al
most sheer, with a little Bilk or a tiny
satin figure, are also good. And there
are countless linens and batistes and
lightweight goods with a silky finish
that make up exquisitely. These goods
are all of a nature which will admit
of the fashionable fuH hip treatment.
Gowns for the Xondon Season.
A- London dressmaker Is responsible
for ths statement that the gowns of
the coming season will be far superior
tp any ever seen before. "Stocks may
be depressed," said he, "and times
hard. But the gowns will bear no evi
dence of this fact. They have never
been lovelier, and the first models
speak volumes for those that are to
come. . "
"One of the most'noticeable features
will be the velvet ribbons or the way
In which the skirts are trimmed with
bands of velvet. Velvet ribbon, by the
way," continued he, "will be much in
evidence. &vA skirts will be trimmed
with it to the exclusion of any other
trimmings.
"There will be charming skirts of
peau de sole, dull and dressy, trimmed
with deep flounces of point d'esprit
lace. Above the point d'esprit lace
there will be a wide band of velvet
ribbon. And, strapping this velvet
ribbon, there will be narrow bands of
dull silk.
"The belt in such cases should be
made of velvet and should be brought
down to a deep point in the middle of
the front."
It is safe to say, judging from cur
sory peeps into the dressmaking par
lors, that velvet ribbon will trim a
great many of the handsomest waists,
whether these be of ribbon or of lace.
And the loveliest effects will be pro
duced by winding narrow bands of
velvet ribbon through the lace an-i
tying it in little knots and bows.
Ribbon, too. Is also to be used In
cuff trimming and it Is to be seen In
every stage of flounce and yoke and
vest trimming. Indeed in one way it
will be conspicuously a ribbon season.
The rule for using tha very narrow
bands of colored velvet ribbon is, ac
cording to a very fashionable shirt
waist trimmer, this: "Take a bolt of
narrow velvet ribbon and thread an
end through a ribbon needle. Go in
and out through the lace, tying: it in a
knot in the middle of ths front. . Try,
in threading the ribbon, to use some
sort of pattern, if it be only a curve,
or a swirl or a little twist, just so as
to relieve the monotony of outline
Use up as much of the velvet ribbon as
possible. When you have completed
the whole you will have a pretty
waist." TThe Dotted Lines Show the Shape of

OUR POLITICIANS
AS THEY APPEAR
TO THE HATTER
IF you want to know what are the
"bumps" that make our "politi
cians successful, don't go to a
phrenologist. Just ask your hat
ter. Ten chances to one the
phrenologist hasn't a record of the
"bumps." The hatter has. And
while you are about it, Just have your
hatter make a copy of your own.
You'd be surprised at the shape of
your cranium, which you'll V discover
has dips and angles where you least
suspect. Incidentally the : record thus
obtained will furnish you much- food
for thought when compared with
those selfsame successful directors of
public affairs. *
If you doubt that the hatter sees
the politician entirely different from
anybody else, look at the dotted lines
encircling each of the photographs on
this page. Those are our politicians
as their hatter sees them. Never
think it, would you? And if any of
them should be Inspired with the di
vine infiatus that is usually the result
of victory, the hatter not only knows
it first, but can accurately gauge its
dimensions and probable latitudinal
and longitudinal development. And
all of this with a little machine that
is as fearful and wonderful to behold
as any instrument of torture in the
dark medieval ages, but which is as
reliable In the story it tells it is
complicated in construction. ' \
In shape it is - like an abbreviated
"plug" hat, made of umbrella ribs,
with a stove lid on the top and four
curved braces to keep the ribs in place
like the cradle props in a drydock. At
first' glance it suggests nothing so
much as & new f angled typewriter, but
when the hatter calms your fears long
enough to place It Upon your head you
are surprised/ to find that it is no
heavier than an ordinary hat and
much more comfortably fitting. To
be sure, it is not exactly a new in
strument, but it Is such a wonderful
improvement over the old head meas
uring machines that its feather weight
is nothing short of astounding. And
It Is with this that all the records of
your "bumps" are made.
Thus, as is so cheerfully Illustrated
on this page by Monsieur Tom.Dil
lon, the Market-street hatter, when
the machine . has been put . on your
head and crushed , down until it feels
as comfortable as your last year's hat,
the little stove lid on the top is opened
up, displaying a yawning curve of
dangerous looking steel pins like
carnivorous teeth.. The oval spring on
the under side of the stove lid is
pressed outward and ; a sheet of blank
paper Inserted Into space behind it The
stove lid Is then closed down again
until the littlesteel pins perforate. the
paper, when It ; Is once . more ; opened

from this map of your "bumps" your

for future reference. This is the up
" to-date way of buying your hats." * .
Hatter Dillon has hundreds of these
little pin perforated maps, and among
them . are the most prominent politi
cians of the last two decades, though
for the purpose of best ; illustrating
this article only the men who are'now,
filling. the public eye are used herewith.
First on the list is Mayor Schmitz.
"Would you ever suspect /from looking
at his face how thebirdseye view of
his head looks to Hatter "Dillon? As
recorded by the head measuring j ma
chine it is almost a 'perfect egg shape,
with only, aj, slight deflection from the'
even curving line on .the left side. As
shown In the pictures, the lower end of
the dotted line is the forehead and the,
upper the back of the head. To the
right of Mayor Schmitz is Franklin K.
Lane and to the left Henry. J. Crocker,
who were" the rival candidates for Mr.
Schmitz's office during, the; last cam
paign. Just note the great dissimilar*
ity in the shape of all these three*
heads. Mayor Schmitz's is widest at a
point directly above the* ears, ,Mr.
Crocker's rfust behind the ears,, while
Mr Lane's, strangest of all, is widest
directly in front of the ears and almost
above the temples, sloping off abruptly
Into a very pointed forehead. It is the
most curiously shaped head of all the
politicians in Hatter Dillon's big col
lection, full of dips and angles and un
expected contusions.
Hatter Dillon explains these sudden
little dips from the even curve of. the
head with the very ingenious theory
that they are caused by sleeping more*
on that 'side of the liead than on the
other. The expert phrenologist would
have quite another theory and would
proceed to demonstrate it thus:, That
the width of the head behind' the ears
denotes the driving force, the grit," the
determination, tlje bulldog tenacity
that brings success," while the width in
front of the ears shows the intellectual
development. Those who are fond of
delving into the sciences, therefore, can
make a comparison between these three
records of the head-measuring machine
and the returns of the last election.
Of almost similar shape to Mr. Crock
er's is the little pin-hole map of Cor
oner Leland's head, though it has
greater proportionate breadth at the
forehead, without any diminution of
width -behind the ears. " Those who
know anything of phrenology may be
able to cujl from this the reason of
Coroner Leland's successive return to
office. Hatter Dillon has his own pecu
liar theories on 'this subject. And -per
haps they are not all based on the rec
ord of his head-measuring machine.
District Attorney Byington's head, as
may ,be seen from the dotted lines
around his portrait, Is of quite a dif
ferent shape, so perhaps the little head
measurer is not an infallible index to
politicarsufecess and perpetuity. The
most prominent protrusion - is here
shown on the. right side of the head,
though whether or not it is the special
."bump" of legal learning does not seem
to be borne out by comparison with the
curvature of three other Judicial and
legal lights. City Attorney Long and
Police Judge Mogan have heads much
alike in shape to be sure, but they' are
nothing like District Attorney Bying
ton's, while on the other hand the shape
of Lawyer Edward L. Sweeney's'^head
is so totally different from the other
three as to belong' to another race en
tirely, though. Hatter Dillon declares
that nativity hasn't anything whatever
to : do' with the subject, at all, at all.
Lawyer Sweeney's head is almost cu
cumber shaped, and in a modified form

Henry H. Lynch is the 'only politician
with a head anywhere apprbachlng it
in curvature. .
In the line of similarity of political,
success and also of contour of cranium
a dance at these â¢ pictures will show
you that -Supervisor "W. "W. Sanderson
and Public Administrator "Billy"
Hynes : have much in common, though
to look at the faces of these two gentle
men is to find absolutely no resem
blance whatever. However, that Is not
where the hatter looks for his points
of resemblance.
Supervisors Oscar Hocks and
dcre Lundstedt, judging from the rec
ords of the head-measuring machine,
might "exchange hats without, finding
unfamiliar pressure anywhere, but
though the 'conformation of these two
heads is almost identical, with the
greatest swell at the right side of the
head just above the ear and the most
"pronounced dip just â¢ over the right
temple, no two men could be ' more
totally unlike in every other way: How
ever, if the hatter is right, that It is
the shape of the head. that wins suc
cess, each of these men might have
prophesied victory, for the. other, based
solely upon the. shape of his own head.
But in how far can this similarity of
shape be relied' upon when we find al
most as next-door neighbors in the
city's administration two men occupy
ing high places whose heads are utterly
unlike* In every particular. \L6bk at
County Clerk Greif's head, and then at
Recorder Godchaux's. The latter is al
most, a perfect pear shape, while the
former is a' scarcely less perfect egg
shape. Nor do the men look at all alike
in any respect. "
More evenly formed than any of these,
is the head of Fire Commissioner Par
ry, who finds his driving force directly
above the ears, with a plentiful width
of forehead. If Hatter Dillon is right
in his theories thqn Commissioner Par
ry has slept . almost equally on both
sides of his head, though whether or
not a politician could improve his
chances by adhesion to one position or
the other In the development of the
shÂ»f e of the head would furnish an ex
cellent field for the test of the theory.
'However, if you are inclined to find
.in these shapes subject for amusement

record of your own, which may furnish
much that Is spicy for your friends' de

LADY HELEN FORBES ON HOSPITALITY
IT would, of course, be hopelessly
trite to say that hospitality is a
word that is very much abused,
but it would be none the Ies3 ap
plicable. It is a grand word, one
which opens out to the eyes of one's
mind a noble vista of ideas; it brings
before them the great houses, open
to all. lavish feasting, a generosity of
Spanish type, "all mine is yours." ask
ing no return, and above all the grace
ful and gracious licure of the lady of

JjOXDON* HOSPITALITY.
In London especially is the principle
of "cutlet for cutlet" adhered to. â¢ So
ciety is very large, and London houses
Rre. comparatively speaking, very
small. They will only hold a percent
age of one's acquaintance, and of what
xise to fill them ud with those who
have nothing to give in return? I
think the idea has srrown since we
had so many millionaires in our ranks.
In the old exclusive days It is possible
that hostesses were not so business
like.
There is one piece of hospitality of
Mhich people who have a house In
London are especially charv. and that
is the greatest kindness in their pow
er. It is putting up people who have
no London house of their own. Of
course these are usually poor people,
glad to save their hotel bill, and the
poor are tn be avoided like the plague
by the "cutlet for cutlet" hostess, al
ways supposing that they are not the
"smart" poor, wonderful people whom
we all know to be penniless, but who
nevertheless manage to go everywhere,
find do everything in the best wav.
"like other people," and to lock smil
ing and splendid all the time. These
rare spirits seldom, if ever, contribute
anything but the dignity of their com
pany to the mutual entertainment of
iheir kind. There is generally the
jjlam >r of some achievement hanging
over them. The men among them are
wonderful shots or amusinc talkers;
the .omen are "beauties" mentioned
by every society paper, or they have
the faculty Â«f "arnvrsing :he men." So
in the end we can see that even these
"poor" Jo something for their hosts
end hostesses. Otherwise they would
cerUiinly not be there,
OVR IY>REIGN' VISITORS.
Foreigners complain that we English
have no idea of hospitality. I think
this is. unfair. We have an idea and'
our idea is fo">d. When â¢â¢? "o abroad,
and are never asked to dinner, but
only to evening parties with very light
refreshments, we think nearly as little
of our entertainers as they do of us
when they come to London, and find
themselves only asked to huge heavy
luncheons, where they overoat them
selves and are bored to death, because
they are not introduced to the whole
company. The English social light
wants food; he doesn't care to know a
lot â¢ strange people. The foreigner
wants to be amused; he doesn't care
whether he pets anything to eat or
not. Most foreign families of la haute
noblcffe would rather go without a
mea! than a carriage or an >ctra foot-
y-.,. ACH child, like each adult, has
T the power to decide whether he
"7 Â» w ill or will not perform a given
t J \ act. Conduct will be good or
V. bad, as the decision is generally
in favor of the right or wrong. Nearly
all we do is the result of a determina
tion to act. This Is so of all organs
bhvc those upon which life and health
depend. Since conduct is the result of
acts of the will, it will readily be seen
that the training of any child to right
action, must be almost entirely a train
ing of the will.' The parent who is suc
cessful in this, most difficult work will
have little trouble in the management
and training; of children.
Will power is the mainspring of every
Individual. Almost every function of
the mind and body is subject to its dic
tates. Scarcely any physical deformity
Is to be so much dreaded as a weak
will. It Is will power which largely de
termines the character of every person.
The individual is likely to be strong
mentally, physically and morally, as he
is able to control his will and direct it
toward proper ends. The will should at
all times obev the dictates of con
science. If it docs not. the result is al
most certaia to be a ruined character.
We must not forget, then, that the
will is the great central, sustaining
force in charat-er. It is the life-giving
power that builds up the elements of
character into a harmonious whole.
That thte important truth may be more
apparent to all. let us consider the
matter more carefully.
Knowledge of right and wrong will
not insure the performance of right ac
tions. The whole being, body and mind,
should obey the commands of the in
ternal compelling force â the wilL Many
who know perfectly well what the mor
al code requires are too weak to follow
It* precepts. The drunkard, for in
stance, knows only too well the disas
trous effects of 6trong drink: but his
tvtll power is too weak to control his
depraved appetite. H e can form the
noblest resolutions and make promises
cif reform, yet resolution and promise
are alike broken repeatedly.
Neither is a tender conscience suf
ficient in itself to brace up a nature
defective in will force. The keenest
sorrow Â«nd shame may be felt for
faults committed, yet again and again
the same fault will be repeated, the
same vicious practice indulged in, be

On the win depends the strengthen-
man. "Wo would sooner be waited on
by parlormaids and go in buses than
miss our fourâ or sometimes fiveâ

the point of view.
It is therefore hopeless to expect
anything in the way of hospitality In
London except food. Sometimes there
Is a little music or a little dancing, but
it is all an excuse for food. So we turn
to the country, hoping to find our ideal
of hospitality there.
There is a certain round of country

August to mid-October; England, co

and possibly part of January". Ireland,

erwise Encland and the hunt ; balls.
These last two are optional, but to
spend the autumn among the grouse,
deer, partridges and pheasants is,
broadly speaking, inevitable. Then the
doors of the country houses fly open
and many strange phenomena are ex
hibited to the view. of the observer of
hospitality.
A COUNTRY HOST'S DIFFICULTIES
Of course there are two sides to this,
as to every other question. There is
the point of view of the host and there
is the point of view of the guest. If we
had more perfect guests we should
doubtless have more perfect hosts to
entertain them. But the guest is often
a sadly annoying personage. This is
strange, because it is so easy to be a
satisfactory guest, far easier than to
be an adequate host. The guest has
only his own demeanor to order,
whereas the host has to make a thou
sand arrangements for the comfort of
his guest. The satisfactory guest is al
ways pleasant and always pleased; he
has his own occupations and does not
har.g heavy on his host's hands; he is
agreeable to the other guests without
monopolizing them; he is punctual to
the minute, gives the servants no ex
tra trouble, tips them properly when he
goes away, does his host credit by his
appearance, manners and conversation
and is altogether a well-regulated in
dividual. But he is rare, and instead of
him we meet with a series of people
each very aggravating in their own
way.
There is the guest who is never In
time. This is a maddening variety. II.
it is a man, he is the bugbear of shoot
ing parties: he is never ready to start,
and disorganizes the whole plan of the
beats, which his host and his keeper
had designed to get- through before
luncheon. If it is a lady, she always
keeps dinner waiting, spoiling the fish,
the temper of the cook, and sometimes
in very aggravated cases where she is
so late that she has to be left behind,
the whole sequence of the procession
into dinner. Both examples Invariably
miss their trains, both coming and go
ing, and thus disarrange parties at
both ends of their visit. This type of
guest is never in the least ashamed of
his or her defects, but rather proud of
them than otherwise. They never con
sider themselves not only rude but ex
tremely selfish; they rather think It
grand and disinterested in them to take
no note of time.
TIIK TROUBIJESCttlE <ZZ?xrz.
Another very selfish guest is the one
who does not know her own mind. I
pay "her" advisedly, because it is al
most always a woman. This guest
never arrives on the day she has pro
mised to arrive, or goes away when she
is expected to do so. She should never

ing of weak points, the resistance to
the assaults of temptation,- the effect
iveness of good resolutions, the carry
ing out of designsâ in fact, the success
of the whole man, morally and materi
ally.
Conscience, with its awakening voice,
may rouse one from an aimless, Inef
fective existence, or from a life of sin
and dishonor and set him upon his feet.
A sense of right and duty will point
out to him the direction his line should
take. Only his will power will hold him
in his upright position and enable him
to move forward with determination
toward a better goal.
All of the fundamental virtues depend
upon the will for their growth and effi
ciency. Even the naturally timid may
gain courage by the exercise of their
wills. They can force themselves to be
brave in danger, to calm all apprehen
sions of evil, to go forward unterrlfled
into peril. The lazy, generally a most
difficult class to deal with, can over
come their aversion to work. They can
make themselves undertake tasks that
they dread and labor perseverlngly to
the end. They can train themselves
to industrious habits.
The will can make the weak strong
and self-reliant, and teach them to de
pend on themselves. It can nerve us
for conflict with difficulties and adversi
ties. It can Inspire with courage for
whatever duty there may be to perform,
for whatever misfortune may befall.
In the realm of justice we can com
pel ourselves to be absolutely truthful
by an act of will, even when the strong
est temptation to tell an untruth pre
sents itself. We can cast out all feel
ings of prejudice and revenge, of un
kindness and selfishness. The most bit
ter-hearted can change his sentiments
if he will and become forgiving. The
most heartless and selfish can become
sympathetic and helpful.
Uncharitable thoughts may be ex
pelled from the mind, spiteful words
may be held back, selfish and cruel
deeds may be restrained, all by the
righteous use of our wills; and the
world will be happier as these wills
work for the ends of Justice.
A strong will power that can govern
emotion, that can secure the mastery
over self, is the secret of self-control.
The bodily appetites, the dangerous de
sire for drink, the craving for injurious
narcotics, may be kept under by its
aid. All passionate outbursts of anger
may . be restrained, violence may be
subdued into gentleness, desire for ex
travagant , amusements and too much
pleasure may be curbed. The whole
being will thus be brought under and

are not in sympathy, and instantly de

In the many practical affairs of
daily life an exercise of will power
will enable us to perform our duties
well and quickly. We can force our
selves to stop and think, to be delib

success depends largely upon attention.
This power of voluntary attention can

The guest who does not harmonize
is a variant of the last named type.
But his defects are generally attributa
ble to the hostess. She ought not to
have asked him. One person whose
passion Is music set down among a lot
of people who think of nothing but
sport is almost certain to be a failure,
and so is the'reverse case. Some hos
tesses have a geDlus for . asking' the

Certainly George Washington stands
for three traits . which belong to the
best type of American character. . In
the first place he was a hard worker.
He owed his advances and his successes
to his own strong right arm and to
his untiring industry. What a splendid
example he is of the men who have
done the rough, hard work necessary
for the development of this great coun
try of ours! I .am not thinking now
only of the battles or the terrible win
ters at Valley Forge, but also of the
experiences on the . frontier as a young
surveyor. Hear what he'says of them
himself in a letter to friend:
"Since last October I have not slept
above three or four nights in a bed,
but . after walking a , good | deal all; the
day I have Iain down 'before .'the': lire
upon * a little hay, straw or fodder, or
a bearskin, 'whichever* was to be had,
and happy, is he 'who gets the ; berth
nearest the fire." Thus was he trained
and toughened in the school of priva
tion, exposure and toil.; And "when one
thinks of | his | tremendous responsibili

the nation, we can hardly find It in our

hardly, any resources in the way of an

circumstances, a master passion. * And

prig, as the cherry tree legend would In
timate. He was a full-blooded. ' large
hearted; fallible' human being, but
among his early writings is a set of a
hundred rules which he had copied in
boyish hand," evidently for his own
guidance.* The : last; rule reads "Labor
to keep alive in your breast that little
spark of celestial fire -called con
science.", And when h a had reached the
summit of his earthly successes his
mother could only say; that' "George

was sure he would do his duty."

at the 'forefront of this nation's life.

Peaceful flirtation is quite another
thing; it helps to oil the wheels. -
Then there is the guest who "asks
himself." This is a very trying per
son, because he is sure not to be want

few hosts have the moral courage to
refuse his request, and so he becomes
He who has no will power cannot pos
sibly succeed in any undertaking. How
important it 13 that every parent
should understand the function and
training of the will before it is too late
to influence it. The laws which govern
its development are well - understood.
The parent who has no knowledge of
the simplest principles, governing the
development of the will need not won
der that he fails to secure obedience
from his children.
A year ago the writer was asked con-'
cernlng the conduct of a boy 15 years
old. The father was -very 'mv.ch pro
voked. He said, in speaking of the
boy, "He always was pig-headed; I
never saw such a stubborn boy. I will
break his will or I will break his back.
I have sent him to the best schools in
the country. I have done everything
in my power, but I cannot break his
will." Such questions as the following
were asked of the parent: "Why
should you want to break his will?
Did you ever stop to think of what it
means to a boy or girl who has a strong
will? Can you blame the boy? Is he
not a 'chip oft the old block? What
wpuld you have amounted to if you
were not as self-willed as you are? You
are a man of very successful business
experience, and have a very large cir
cle of . acquaintances among business
men. Do you know of any one who
has Avon great success In any line of
business, except by perseverance and
hard work, the result of strong deter
mination? i What you want to do" for
that boy is to try to train hi3 will. Di
rect it into proper channels, and he may
have as great success.ln his life's work
as his father has had. Do as you
threatened td do, break hia will if you
can, and you will havg ruined his
chances for. success In life. A broken
will is just about as valuable as a
broken bow."
_The good sense of the gentleman led
him to agree that he had been wrong
and to express! the determination of
treating the boy differently in the fu-
U f e - t , Would tna * *Â« parents, to whose
attention this matter is called, would

has given no trouble to any one. To

But for a little patience at a time when
it was needed, he would now be an out
cast from home, wandering, as many
others have been compelled to, because
parents did not understand the first

and the same guest who won't go away.
This is a very tedious variety. He a
ways stays on after the rest of the
party when the host and hostess want
to be left alone. lie is always a per
son who wants to be amused contin
ually, and cannot bear his own com
pany. â¢
THE GUEST'S POINT OF VIEW.
But tliere Is another point of view
rrbm which to view hospitalityâ that or
the guest. And if the guest is frequent
ly a trial, the host is quite as rarely
satisfactory. The perfect host (and for
host read hostess) would be one who
thought of his guests before himseL.
and that is scarcely in human nature.
The best sort of host we meet is one
rfho leaves his guests completely alone
and lets them do exactly what they
like; for them he makes his house a
hotel where they do not have to pay.
Everything they want is at their ser
vice in abundance. Meals are at the
time they are supposed to be ready, tor
the unpunctual host and his conse
quently unpunctual servants are as
much to be deprecated as the unpunc
tual guest. The 'desirable kind of guest
does not care to stay in houses where
he is made more uncomfortable than he
would be at hts club; It is not worth his
while. And If he finds himself by
chance In such a house he has a conve
nient telegram which gives him an ex
cuse to go away, and he does not com*
back: moreover, he warns his friends,
and that house gets a bad name.
The worst sort of host is he who or
ders his guests about. He looks upon
them as Instruments for his amuse
ment and pleasure, and neveY thinks
about theirs. He will not allow them to
express any Independent desires. It ne
says they are to drive or to walk or to
go in a motor car. they must do so.
however much they wish to sit at home
with a book. If he Insists on their go
in?r to church or attending family
prayers, they have to do so, even at the
risk of committing mortal sin. if they
happen 1 to be of a different religious
persuasion to their host. They seldom
have the moral courage or rudeness to
resist. For this sort of host is keenly
alive the the selfishness of his guests,
though blind to his own: he hardly ever
asks the mindless or the unpunctual or
the quarrelsome guest to his house.
THE BAD HOST.
Another bad entertainer is the mean
host. This type grudges every scrap
of food his zuests eat. wine that they
drink or fuel that they burn, and
makes them feel that they arc costing
him money. He thinks, and not in
frequently says, that he is doing: peo
ple a kindness in extending: his hos
pitality to them. It is a very poor
sort of kindness to ask them to a place
where they will neither be amused nor
well fed, and one for which he i3 like
ly to receive as much gratitude â as it
deserves.
A third terrible host is he who
spies on hia guests. This type asks
two people who have * been talked
about together for the express purpose
of "seefhg If there is anything in it."
He Is Quite devoid of the Hense of loy
alty and is therefore capable of listen-
Ing behind doors for the purpose of
gratifying 1 his morbid curiosity. He
does not seem to see that if there is
any liaison between his guests which
should not exist he is a condoner and
therefore at least half as guilty.
Then there is the host who wrangle3
with his wife and pulls the domestic
machinery to pieces before his guest's
eyes. There is the host who does not
know you by sight and cuts you dead
when he next meejts you. There is the
host who tells you long, pointless sto
ries â he is very common. There Is
the host who bores you with his
money affairs, his religion or his phy
sical ailments. In short the bad host
is as common as the bad guest and as
trying. In these matters there is only
one motto for all concerned. Flee the
selfish; cleave to those who from
breeding or Christian charity or both
put you first and themselves second.
For the others, their entertainments
may be magnificent; they are not hos
pitality. HELEN FORBES.
principles of the right management of
those of strong will. .
Too few have given any considera
tion to this subject- Still fewer appre
ciate the Importance of seeing clearly
the difference between will training
and will breaking. .The training of a
child's will implies 'teaching him to
choose one of several courses. Thus,
by bringing influences to bear upon a
child, he may be induced to decide for
himself. Breaking his will is forclnff
him to do what be is told, regardless
of what he wishes to do. This takes
from the child his power of free choice,
which is the highest expression of hta
true personality. Nevertheless, the
child should understand clearly the re
suit of not choosing wisely. For exam
ple, suppose a child is told to leave tha
room. He refuses to do so. The par
ent, without further words, whips him
until he does leave the room or until
the parent sees it is impossible to
break his will. Would It not be wiser
for the parent to first tell the child
that, if he does not leave the room. It
will be necessary to punish him severe
ly? After having given plenty of time
for making a choice, it may be neces
sary for the parent to remove the child
by main force. But the child has been
given the option of either leaving or
taking the consequences.
Is not this God's way of treatlny us?
Does he not permit every person to
choose between right and wrong? Ev
erywhere and at all times and under all
circumstances he gives to man the
freedom of choice. This is given with
the distinct understanding that he must
take the consequences. He presents
the advantages of one course of action
and the disadvantages of the other.
Upon Uman he always places the re
sponsibility of chooslns: between the
right and the wrong. Can any parent
find a better way to train his own chil
dren?
In most cases the will of a child is.
at first, qufte weak. It grows stronger
with years. At the same age it is much
stronger in some children than in oth
ers. The child of strong: will must be
treated carefully. In the "Talks on
Obedience. Incentives and the Stubborn
Child" many incentives will be found.
At this time it Is not necessary to do
more than emphasize the fact that
there must be no conflict between the
will of the parent and that of the child.
Such is a conflict of brute force. The
stronger will be victorious. Punish
ment will do no good, save as it shows
a child that it does not pay to will to do
wrong. The will must be trained
through the feelings. It is the only way
that it can possibly be trained-The Catholic

*^T tUS you the master or an art or

I | plainly your duly to join the

to the cx.ui.0 and in return re
ceive the substantial reminder that you
are a. fuli-i!edged member.
The idea is nothing new. but the fact
that society gills have taken it up, and
rot in the fashion of keeping their
light hand from knowing what their
left is do-ing either, has lent zest to
the matter. They are boasting of their
ability and are gleefully buying frills
and furbelows that have heretofore
b?en considered just a wee bit of an
extravagance. Bat why shouidn^t they,
pray? If they are willing to- devote
an hour each morning to a certain
cause should not the fruit of their labor
be disposed of as they see fit?

Â«*Â» rt R. J. COLDBRICKS was a
/ \/ I lineal descendant of the late
I Captain Kidd. Both did their
J^ work on water, although the
latter had his confined in the sea, to
which he had acquired the habit of go
ing down in ships, while the former
took his in railroad stocks. Their fate
was a trifle different also in that the
captain was gently but firmly and
effectually hanged while the other was
c::Jy pilloried in the public press and
roasted in the pulpit. Mr. Goldbricks'
operations were more refined than thoae
of his predecessor, but they were much
more to the poiat. A specialty of his
was to cast a spell over a railroad that
had beon on the verge of dissolution
for a lone time. Then he would an
nounce that he had secured a controll
ing interest in the line and that it
would immediately be put on a paying
basisâ for .him. After he had succeeded
in inducing a sufficient number, of
widows a;id orphans to C;g their stock-
Jr.gs out o' the bottom bureau drawer
and empty them out on the rlght-of
v. f ay he would issue a revised announce
ment that owing to the unexpected ap
pearance of circumstances over which
i!'_ had no control the road would be
unable to pay dividends on any but
the first pref?rre<J. leaving the second,
third and fourth preferred and the
various forms of common stock to go
their way in peace. Whenever this
happened it was a sure sign that be
tween 93 and 100 per cent of the first
preferred was safejy salted away In
the coffers of the said J. Goldbricka.
It is estimated that he received at
least seventy-five letters a day, point
ing out to him the exceeding sinfulness
of his possessing millions, while there
were poor women and children starv
ing for the want of an automobile or
a seat at the grand opera. People who
wouldn't have recognized a $20 bill if
they had met it on the street were full
peating lengths and they, do not come
in great sizes, but they are plenty
large enough for good sized panels, and
that is all the average person uses
them for anyway.
The linens come in a variety of de
signs and colors, although but two
tc-nes are combined together. For in
stance, blue and white, red and blue
or any other two colors that blend
prettily, but the patterns are as varied
as ore could wish for. The one trouble
is the smell lengths that are woven.
Enough and to spare for shirt waists,
aprons, bags of any description, or the
endless amount c-f articles that require
but three or four yards, but never
enough for a frock, although an order
wouid secure any quantity and any
colors.
Roumanian embroidery has come in
with such a flourish that there is "an
endless variety of it on hand. It Is a
Epecies of Turkish embroidery, the de
signs consisting entirely of straight
lines. Like cross-stitch work, it is done
entirely by the mesh of the material, or
if the background is one that is woven
closely, such as linen or silk, Java can
vas is basted over the surface and
when the embroidery is completed it
is romoved thread by thread. Bright
colors are always selected, such as red
and a peculiar shade of blue, and a
pattern entirely composed of yellow is
frequently used. There are top" collars
and cuffs, dollies and tray cloths and a

only listen to them. 'â¢ ' .
In the midst of this torrent of good
advice he went calmly on his way,
working twelve hours a day and living
o:. oatmeal and pre-digested crackers
and shaking down the tjreat American
public for subscriptions to railroads
that never fan and wouldn't have,
known where to run to if they had had*
the chance. In the course of time he
laid aside the ticker tape and quietly
and unostentatiously died, as he had
lived, with his eyes fixed on the fu
ture(s). It is needless to add that he
didn't take a large part of his money
with him, which was probably fortu
nate for the money, as very llttfe of It
is being printed on asbestos paper now
adays. When the news of his death ap
peared on the front page in immediate
juxtaposition to the report of an ex
pected hot wave the newspapers rose
up and called the attention of the
young men of the country to the mad
ness of striving for more wealth than
could conveniently be concealed from
the assessor. The obituary articles
that blossomed out in all sorts of pub
lications were about as complimentary
as the speeches at an election for presi
dent of a well-conducted woman's club.
There was not complete agreement as
to whether he should take rank- in his
tory with Nero and the Borgias or
with the man who stole Charley. Ross
or the hitherto undiscovered gentleman
who committed assault and battery on
the person of the late Billy Patterson,
but there was general unanimity of
feeling that when his name appeared
in the Hall of Fame it would be time
to burn the jails and turn the Govern
ment over to a syndicate of presidents
of South American ' republics. â  That
any cue should ever rise up and call
him blessed was considered about' as
likely as that the Mississippi River
should overcome its natural prejudices
and flow back past St. Louis again,
It so happened that among the heirs
whom Mr. Goldbricks regretfully left
behind him. there were one or two who
had advanced' ideas on the duties of
rich men, aside from inheritance'- taxes
and the Customhouse hold-up. They
of the opinion, that a vigorous
application of philanthropy- would wash
all tl.v stains off the prdinary double
eagle of commerce and that even - the
more vulgar $5 bill might be cleansed
cf all uncleanness. In - pursuance of
this laudable enterprise for. : the pro
motion of the public health, and the re
vamping of their ancestor's time-worn
and travel-stained ' reputation, they
made public large and imposing plans
for the erection of the J. Gold
bricks Memorial Hospital to cost at
least $1,000,000. This was followed up
by a gift'of a few hundred thousand
to the Omnibus Univera.ty, with '"'â  the
small condition that the university
should erect a statue on the campus
showing J. Goldbricka in the .act of
receiving a vote of thanks and a hand
embroidered copy "of the Ten Com
mandments from a delegation of wid
ows and orphans whom: he had - ab
solved from what is considered â¢: to be
the root of all evil. ' ,
About the time that the storm - was
at its height manifestations' began to
appear that the country had been mis
taken in its first estimate of the char
acter and probable future estate of
the late J. Goldbricks. The first symp
tom was the cropping 'out of a lead of
editorials pointing out that the world's
great men were seldom valued at their
true worth ; by their â¢"â  own â¢ generation.
Then people began to wake u. to a
realization of the fact that the exigen
cies of modern business, or something:
that sounded like that, wouldn't allow
business j men' to adopt the' same meth
ods that would bring success in a Sun-

aay-scnooi. From this stage the
transition was . easy to unadulterated
praise of Goldbricks as that prince of
business men and Napoleon of finance
whose death was .an irreparable loss
to the community. It was all of that,
for while he was still oh this mundane
sphere there was a chance that- some
one would ' get _ him on the short side
. and^ squeeze , a "few cents : out of him.
â  His 'past misdeeds were all forgotten
and his panel in the Hall of Fame was

inscribed "To Â«thÂ«' man who has -done

line of work that is displayed. The
foundation is a smooth linen and a
heavy white cotton i3 used in carrying
out the design. It is something that
every one can do, but like the majority
of fussy work, very few have the
patience to apply themselves to it. It is
in reality buttonholing, for it covers
all the cut out edges of the linen and
as the designs are formed in this fash
ion, it is easy to see that it is all im
portant.
But needlework in its various phases

there are quite aa many men wÂ»3 are

women.
The beaten brass and copper articles
are worth seeing in themselves. The
one staple article that catches and
holds the eye just at present is the can
dlestick, and as no two are ever ex
actly alike, they are a fascinating
study. As a fad there are few things
more satisfactory to collect, for they
arc nearly always unfque and are dis
tinctly serviceable as well these days.
Perhaps the ones that attract the most
attention are tho3c that fasten to the
walls by means c-r a screw or tack. â¢ A

inches in length and probably about
half the size in width, projecting and
held in place by a slender brass rod. la

chance to be any. A dozen, more or
less, lined about on the walls would be
perfectly charming in a dining-room or
den, especially If some of the trays,
decanters and bowls were setting about
hsre and there to further the idea.
Naturally candlesticks call for shades
and there are an endless variety of
them in appliqued leather, both burned
and colored, and in the heavy papers.
Instead of fretting and fuming about
the correct colors for the tables, all
you have to do is to select your color*
and the guild does the rest, and on re
markably short notice at that.
All sorts and conditions of leather
work are right in their line â gorgeous
fruit panels for dining-rooms, heads
and pictures for pillows, exquisite pic
ture frames, and last but not least,
leather bookbinding that in itself Is an
exquisite art.
In the picture line there are etchings,
paintings, .water colors and the best
that the camera is capable of, all daint

and waiting for an opportunity to bÂ«

crowded out of their original house and

both an art and a craft, screens, by the

REFLECTIONS OF THOMAS FITCH
(Copyright. 1904, by Thomas Fitch.)
THEODORE ROOSEVELT is a
rare combination of genius,
common sense, impulse, reflec
tion, sagacity "and fly up the
creek." His dominant charac
teristic is a virile conscience, which
though free from pharasalcaJ parade
of itself yet causes hijn to follow his
ccnvictier.s of duty persistently wher
ever they may lead him. As a private
citizen he is not lacking in toleration
*or human frailties, as a public of
ficer he will not spare en offender. As
a citizen he would act t!ie part of cood
Samaritan toward a wounded stranger
end let the thieves go. A3 an official
he would have followed the rascals
to Jericho and punished them merci
lessly.
Roosevelt was anxious to personally
engage In the t'pauish war on lin??
that would give scope to his individ
uality and he organized a body of
fighters whose specialty was to be
,their rough riding.
1 But in order to get a chance to
Tight at all they were compelled to
leave their horses behind them an4
(they charged up the slopes cf San
Juan hill, the first body of horseless
cavalry in the world.
In brief. Roosevelt reaches for re-
Jlts and Is not a slave to methods.
But he Is j.robably the most practical
or rather the most impractical poli
tician in his party. As a private citi
zen there would have been no impro
priety hi his seating at his table one
cf the greatest and most useful col
ored men in America, but an invita
tion Â».o <1ine at the White House ex
tended by the President of the United
States to a negro needlessly offended
the prejudices of millions of white
voters and was of no substantial ben
efit of the colored people. Prejudices,
however unwarranted, wiii exist and
to an extent th?y influence the polit
ical action of those who entertain
them.
Even th* Union poldiers during the
Â«ar voiced this prejudice in the re
frain of Private Miles O'Rcilley's
song:
We arc filer.':* cf the Union, nil Its foes tve
abhor.
liui Â»-f a!n't f'.r th* r.'cger, tbocxta w% are
for The vrcr.
Later yet these prejudices found ut
terance in the caustic comment of Pe
troleum V. Nasby. "Our colored ally,"
said he. "Tow that he is no longer
needed to stend between a white man
and a rebel bullet, is the same dâ d
rigger that he always v.af."
It is no credit to the Intelligence of
the people that indiscreet utterances
and indiscreet acts will often inflict
more irjury upon a candidate or a
cause than a lifetime of wise public
service will neutralize. The "Rum, Ro
manism and Rebellion" paragraph* of
Preacher Burchard's address enraged
a sufficient number of Catholic Irish to
defeat James G. Blaine for the Presi
dency.
Possibly the unnecessary negro guest
at the White House and the unneces
rary negro officeholder in South Caro
lina may work a similar disaster to
President Roosevelt.
Yet the great lines of strength which
t:e Theodore Roosevelt to the public
heart may not be easily broken. Many
public officials regard public office as a
personal possession. President Roose
velt is saturated through and through
with the Idea that It Is a public trust.
There will remain no corrupt men in
public cff.ee under him if he knows It,
yct-he has rot sought to fit the quali
heatiens and capacities and characters
Â«-f his appointees to any Procrustean
bed of his own making. He has not In
2ii/ instance been ruled by the ma
tliir.c. neither has he attempted to de
fctrcy or ignore it, for he well knows
that any rarty composed only of pur
ists would be apt to dwell In the lone-
Eomeneaa and unusefulness of a minor
ity, and that In practical politics
every clement that is essential to suc-

v.ith republican forms and with de

is the coping-stone of the democratic
eystem that may. without any violence
to the throne, be made more fully
democratic If class influences, the be
quest of oligarchy, have to give way,
as they must, and If the power of
what is known as society is held in
/ess must be considered. "Gentlemen,"

vention for the nomination for State

well drunk. My honorable competitor,
who hr.s a larger carrying: capacity

that I have a duty to. perform to oth

Inclination and circumstances led
Theodore Roosevelt during his earlier
years to labor in the' library rather
than In the forum, yet his campaign
In 1SSO and his tour of the country in
that year proved that he has the nat
ural aptitude and qualifications of a
great debater. He has a wonderful
memory and a power of instantaneous
absorption, and every new idea be
comes at once a part of himself. His
mind is a chemical solvent of thought
into which great ideas can be thrown
with the assurance that they will come
forth clean, crystallized and' compact.
Hi.s syllogisms are iron limbed and no
sc-rhistries can live in their embrace.
His power of rapid and correct gen
eralization is supreme. No man can
reason ir.ore rapidly and more cogently
from cause to effect, or frpm circum
stance to principle. All the vast and
varied resources of his extensive read
ing awJ experience, all his capacity for
instantaneous and correct conclusions,
all the intuitive knowledge of his great
genius r.eem always to be at his imme
diate command. It requires opposition,
danger, excitement tg evoke his full
powers, and then he arises equal to
tht-> ooi.-nsion. ' â¢ â 
He has a keen sense of humor. The
Rough Riders ate uncomplainingly of
the embalmed beef with which Com
missary Genera] Egan is allowed to
have provided them, but when, re
turned from the war. ' they were
camp?d at Mor.tauk and fed by pa
triotic women w!th milk, angel cake,
mince pies and quince preserves,, they
became critical as to their diet and
would not submit to the neglect from
the commissary department.
One: mcrninjr :i committee of three
vi?ited Colonel Roosevelt's headquar
ters and requcrted an interview. Their
commander was entertaining some call
ers, but he went forward to hoar the
committee.
"Colonel," said a tall Arizonan with
mailcs-ujxjtj his cheek of a wound he
had received while charging up San
Juan hill; "colonel, this is the second
morning that the soldiers of Company
D have been without a particle of fresh
cream for their coffea."
Roosevelt looked at the speaker and
his companions, a swarthy Texan and
a steel-eyed bronco buster frtrm Colo
rado and said slowly and sympathiz
ingly: "You poor thlngsr you poor
things." The committee slunk away
without another word. But next morn
ing Company D had a full supply of
cream.
Roosevelt wr.s accompanied on his
campaign for Governor of New York
by several rough riders, whose appear
ance at his meetings added great inter
*rt and piquancy to the campaign. One
of these expressed a strong desire to
make a short speech. He admitted that
he had had no experience 38 an orator
and the committee "sat down" upon
his aspirations. But he persisted in
his application and made a personal ap
peal to Roosevelt. "All right. Jack,"
said Roosevelt; "I will fix you at Utica.
Don't say anything to anybody about
it, and when I have finished my speech
to-night I will Introduce you to the
audience."
At the conclusion of his remarks that
night Colonel Roosevelt, with a twinkle
In his eye. said: "Fellow citizens, I
will now take the liberty of introducing
to you for a few remarks myfriend and
comrade, Sergeant Jc-seph Godfrey of
Texas." â¢
The members of the committee grew
white with apprehension, but Sergeant
Godfrey advanced confidently and was
welcomed with a roar of cheers. He
stretched forth an arm like unto that
cf Samson.' "Muffriends," said he, "I
am no speakah. I have always been a
Democrat, and when 1 return to Texas
I shall again be with mch party, but I
love mah kuhnal, and if I wah a votah
here I should vote for him, foh, suah,
he is a great man. Some kuhnals I have
seen marched in the reah, but . mah
kuhnal always marched In the front.
Some other kuhnals followed their regi-
check, as It will be, the prestige of
the throne may be enhanced, instead
of dimmed. A radical change in the
constitution and functions of the
House of Lords may leave the consti
tutional monarchy unimpaired.
A Republic in. the Abstract.
A House of Commons, "broad-based
upon the people's will" to an . extent
unknown to-day, may not be unmind
ful of advantages that an hereditary
president can offer over and above a
party leader who rises to the chief of
fice of the' state by a party vote. The
late Peter Taylor, a ' predecessor of
mine In 'the* representation of Leices
ter, once said he was "a republican in
the abstract." Well, we have a re
public in the abstract; I believe that
in future it will be more and more a
democratic republic. We have wit
nessed great social changes in the
past; In the future we shall see more.
The poor law is socialistic. The edu
cation act is another illustration of
what I mean by socialistic develop
ment. The powers of poor law guar
dians in the relief of distress are very
important, with a sympathtic com-
nients accerdin* to the army regula
tions. Did mah kuhnal do that? No,
muffriends; he always led us; he led us
like sheep to the slaughter." And there
the speech ended, amid roars of laugh
ter and applause.
When Theodore Roosevelt as candi
date for. Vice President was on his
stumping tour in the West, prepara
tions were made to give him a great
reception on his. arrival at Salt Lake
City. â¢ The committee provided a mag
nificent horse caparisoned with the
American flag and an escort of twenty
of the best horsemen in the State. Col
onel Roosevelt on being informed of
the programme declined absolutely to
carry it out."
"I will not." he said, "turn this cam
paign into a circus. I shall be very
glad, however, after the reception is
over to take a little horseback exercise
around the city.-''
This was agreed upon and the guest
was taken in a carriage to the rooms
of the Alta Club, where, after a lunch
and handshaking and speechmaking,
the chairman of the committee â himself
one of the Rough, Riders, and accred
ited with being the best horseman in

feel too tired to take a ride about the
city now, your horse is at the door, and
I and a few of the boys will escort you
and show you the way."
Roosevelt accepted and his animal â
a magnificent bay â was led to the front.
"Mount," said the committe,eman to the
escort, and twenty cowboys leaped into
their saddles. "Shall I assist you to
mount. Colonel Rosevelt?!' said the ur
bane committeeman. "It will not, I
think, be necessary," said the candidate
for Vice President, placing his glksses
In* his pocket and buttoning his coat.
"I will i!de alongside you and show

The day is coming when poor relief

disapprove of the last education acts;
in the future they will have to be

they will become more socialistic. But

of their suect on that ride 'was a streak

. To be esteemed great among, tha men
of this day and generation, requires

of any ever before. demanded. As was
said in substance: by a great English
poet, "We are dwarfs in knowledge, iu
our relations to the physical and men
tal universe, but we are dwarf s" parch*
ed upen the shoulders -of the giants of
the generations which have. gone be
fore and our eyes scan ahorizorf which

can so tower above their fellows as to
define an outline against traah a hori-
zon must be giants indeed."
The proverb which says that "some
men are born to greatness, some
achieve greatness and some have great
ness thrust upon, them" may be ques
tioned. It is doubtful whether a man
who is not born great can ever achieve
greatness, for if fame be thrust upon
a man of common nature he will be
apt to contradict the proverb by prov
ing unequal to the occasion. It is
doubtful If circumstances or accident
ever made a great man. They may de
velop latent genius, but God Almighty
enjoys a monopoly of its creation.

Wlint a Democracy Would- Do.
A thoroughly enfranchised democ
racy will have great regard. for the
rights and duties of society, but It will
not forget/ the- responsibilities of the
individual. It will not destroy all pri
vate'property or rob the 'Individual of
Incentives to personal excellence, thrift
and providence. Neither wiir.it set
the interests .of 'a : class above those
of the community. An enlightened de
mocracy will refuse to take ff narrow
view of public needs ' and decline- to;
inflate the prejudices of a section to
the i hurt . of the ; whole . body. It will
preserve individual right, but' as so
ciety, is but the Individual in the ag
gregate It will exercise the power of
society, for the communal good. The
aged and deserving poor will '.receive
assistance . without -â¢ any . attendance
mark 'â  of degradation. '; The * education
system > will open elementary , schools,
technical - seminaries . and the unlversl-
riflce, 'from care for others. In few
natures are to be found 'poised with
such perfectness and exactness the po
etical and the practical elements of
mind. His early inspirations took
Hcholarly ways. He liked to unravel
the mysteries of science, to analyze
the legends of history, to untangle the
paths of philosophy. Then r he faced
unflinchingly the exigencies of a West
ern frontier, life.
He borrowed dignity and grace
from the. untamed grandeur of phys
ical nature - and courage was his , by
instinct and inheritance. His hardy,
hopeful zeal saw high; purpose In
every storm that beat upbn'his cabin."
As one result of thi3. noble education
he presents I his thoughts in'- English
as terse and vigorous as it is pure. He
takes the model: for; his expression
from the classic philosophy .of the
ties to all children with brains. As
Sir Norman Lockyer said at the Brit
ish Association, henceforth science and
brains will take the place of swords
and sinews. Education: enlightenment
is the vital breath >of democracy. De
mocracy In proportion as it Is true to
itself will insist upon efficiency in every
department of the public service; the
army and the navy . will not provide
outdoor relief for -the scions of an ef
fete aristc-cracy.
.The workers will be protected In their
daily avocations and in their homes by
a healthy environment and assured of
compensation if they are wounded In
the industrial fight. they fall
in the struggle, those. whom they leave
behind them will not be deserted by
the * community to - eat ' the bread of
grudging charity. ..While private enter
prise will not be discouraged, means
will be' found "for insuring a fairer dis
tribution of the wealth that capital and
labor combine to produce; the rights of
the state in land and minerals will be
exalted above the privileges of classes;
taxation will \ be * fairly-, adjusted and
equality ! of opportunity â¢ will; be j secured
before : the law for all. The ' democracy
will have days of trial and depression;
ancients; he drew the inspiration of
action from the practical philos
ophy of the day. His bow has the
stretch and beauty of one wielded by
an ancient archer; the arrow strikes
the mark with the precision and pow
er of a bullet from a Mauser rifle. He
thinks .in Greek and acts in Anglo-
Saxon. He walks with: Socrates along
the. streets of *' a Montana mining
camp, and compels the philosopher of
antiquity to electioneer for the Repub
lican, ticket. He is the Chevalier Bay
ard of Jils century. He has all the
singleness of purpose and devotedness
of the Puritan and all the grace, cour
tesy and dash of the cavalier. He
"would be equally at home in Athens
"or Chicago. The restless, hurrying
. life of the West suits his ardent spirit,
the calm philosophy of the ancients
is congenial to his' classic mind. He
is the type of Northern chivalry â the
spirit of generous daring and defiance
of conventionalities mingled with ar
dent love of justice. A spirit born of
the marriage of correct, cold, erudite,
determined New England with the en-
It will have its difficulties and disap
pointments; but It will, rise above them
and carry forward that "great work- of
national progress, which, â  though often
obstructed and for a time thwarted,
nevertheless moves forward slowly and
surely. -This faith In democracy â not
one class, but the combination of all
classes, for the common good â was the
faith of my youth and of my prime; it
Is the faith of my old age. I see no
reason for abandoning 1 it; rather I hold
fast to It as unto that, which Is good.
The Results of Extending Suffrage.
The question may. be- asked If the re
sults of . the extension of the suffrage
in England have been in accord with
the hopes of the reformers who strove
during so many years to place the re
form bills on. the statute book. I am
afraid the answer to that must- be a
negative one. Each act has been fol
lowed by the . election of Parliaments
that did much for the cause of progress.
For example, the. act of 1832 made pos
sible the reform of municipal corpora
tions; the years between 1868 and 1874
have been called the 1 "golden age of
Liberalism"; the last franchise .act
made - the reforms of recent years' in
evitable. ; But the ' enfranchised masses
have not shown aa a body that stead
fastness and determination that the
thusTnstlc. earn3st. v.-arm- hearted and
dare devil West, it will never be
sÂ»aid of him, a3 Fontenelle said of a
French statesman, "He has aa good
a heart as can be made out of brains,"
for heart and brains are close part
ners in hi3 makeup.
President Roosevelt Is equally well
equipped to dispute with a Harvard
professor on the character of Pericles
or to engage in a war of wit on tho
hustings. He faced the Iron hall at
Santiago unflinchingly and a few
months later ha extorted from tha
critics unmeasured praise for his his
torical essays on the American revo
lution.
The history of his career affords a
lesson which may well put hopÂ« Into
the humblest heart. It is tha proud
boast of our Government that It Is
able to furnish a pedestal, for such
gifts and such goodness as aro em
bodied in tha character of our Pres
ident, and it Is a boast not less proud
that the people were wise enough and
Just enough to accord to him the po
sitions that he has achieved.
Not all who win the race may wear
the laurel, but one such selection re
deems many of the errors of our pol
itics and atones for many a corrupt
or cowardly cno'ce.
The writer of this article was in
Washington for a few days in the
spring of 1903, and called at the "White
House to pay his respects. While wait
ing in the small anteroom adjoining the
President's private office there entered
upon a similar errand of courtesy the
grand old poet, Joaqulh Miller. Joaquin
and my wife and I have been close
friends, in sunshine and in storm, for
thirty years, although we had not met
for some time. We engaged in close
conversation, and did not notice that
the room was filling with Senators and
Representatives, who had, the privilege
of entering and who came to see the
President on business. . .- -; -
President Roose/ilt entered the room
suddenly and almost brusquely. With
rapid nods and greetings to the occu
pants he passed them by, and placing
both hands in those of Joaquin greeted
him warmly and engaged him in con
versation. It was hardly conversation,
for It was a monologue of friendly crit
icism and praise of one of the later ef
fusions of the poet. "Wait a minute."
said Roosevelt, and he ran like a boy
Into an adjacent room and returned
with a manuscript In his hand. "See."
said he, "I have quoted these lines of
yours in this article." And he then re
cited some verses by Joaquin, while
the old poet stood blushing like a boy.
â¢â¢That Is all that I can stand at one
time. Mr. President," said the poet.
"Good-by," and with a parting wring
from Roosevelt's hand he started for
the- door.
And the Senators and Congressmen
waited and listened and looked, and it
seemed to be gradually dawning upon
them that there are nearly 500 of them,
all told, in this republic of ours, and
only one Joaquin Miller.
"Agitators" of 1832, 1867 and 1884
found essential. They have fallen into
apathy and Indifference too frequently,
as I should say. On the other hand,
the Conservatives have found that all
their fears were the vain imaginations
that their opponents told them they
were. Sir Robert Inglls said the Grey-
Russell act would bring about a revo
lution; as a matter of fact it prevented
one. When the Government in 1867
came at last to household suffrage In
boroughs, it was said in the House of
Lords that they were "taking a leap
In the dark." Perhaps they thought it
was a jump Into the abyss, but the
Liberal Ministry of 1S68 was followed
by a Tory government In 1874. Sir Staf
ford Northcote said the bill of 1S8I
would "let loose upon the constitu
encies," two millions of voters, unln
structed, and all the rest of it. These
two millions, or very many, of them,
have helped to keep the Unionists In
office and In power. Some cf us had
begun. to think it possible in view of
certain things that have occurred, that
absolution might even be restored un
ner democratic or : semi-democratic
forms. We may have hopes that that
â¢will not be so. but Conservative alarms
on account of the extension of popular
freedom and responsibilities have been
proved to be groundless.

MANCHURIA, PRIZE OF THE EAST, IS ONE OF THE RICHEST
AND BROADEST DISTRICTS ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH
British Islands and Many American
States Gould Be Quartered -
Within Its Area.
LONDON. Feb. 20. â At the out
break of the Etruggle between Japan
and Russia little was known by Amer
ica of the cause. Still less is known
about the country over which the war
is being wa^ed. The quarrel in the
East has been fcf such long duration
find so much had been written of the
threatened rupture between nations
over the partitioning of China that
;.eople on this continent had come
to regard the whole subject with in
difference. But now the war is on.
Where will it end is the greatest in
ternational problem that has appeared
for a century-
Russia and Japan are striving, the
former to occupy and the latter to pre
vent the occupation of that portion of
Northeastern China, lying south of the
Amur River and over which a diplo
matic duel has long been in progress.
For years past Americans have read
of the Russian invasion of Manchuria.
They have perused columns of opin
ions on the convention of 1896, when
Russia and Japan signed articles recog
nizing the sovereignty and independ
ence of Korea. The question has often
been asked: "Why does Russia want
Manchuria? "Why does Japan oppose
the scheme?"
Manchuria is an empire in itself. It
i% more favorably situated as to cli
mate than any other part of China. It
is bounded on the north by the rich
laryis of Siberia, on the south by Ko
rea and the gTilfs and bays of the Tel
low Sea, on the east partly by the
praln fields of Siberia, and on the west
by Mongolia. Here only is Manchu
ria touched by an arm of the^ Mongo
lian desert. Reference to the accom
panying map will show the vastness of
the Manchurian domain.
Almost 400,000 square miles of the
earth's surface are contained within
the borders of the province. The fol
lowing table of areas as illustrated In
the map is interesting:

is in its physical | features that
Manchuria is rich, for it can safely be
ttatcd that within the 400,000 square
miles a population of only 13-000,000 of
unenterprising people exist, to whom
mining or exploring is either forbidden
by the Government or who are too lazy
to go beyond their own back yard.
Manchuria is divided into two fer
tile regions. The valleys and plains
of the north drain through the Amur
to the sea of Ohkotsk, the others
southward to the Yellow Sea. Here
we find the greatest variety of climate
arid condition* of soil. The northern
part is similar to Siberia, while South
ern Manchuria in climate, vegetation
und inhabitant* bears resemblance to
China.
Conic crests of extinct volcanoes in
Northern Manchuria along the range
of the Khingan Mountains stand out
boldly against the deeply wooded
gorges of the affluents of the River
Nonni and here at its base are rich
sulphur beds, which the Government
does not allow to be worked.
* Nprth of Upper Nonni Valley the
Great Khingan is connected by a high
land region and' at its highest point a
Chinese temple invites travelers of
all nations to come and worship at its
shrine. Here the Manchu poet sang of
the Shan-Alin, the sacred home of his
forefathers.
The two chief Manchurian rivers flow
in opposite directions, the Sungari.be
ing the main stream of the common
basin which forms the Amur. During
the floods this river becomes an inland
sea with islands, the resort of count
less flocks of wild swan, geese and
ducks. The Shara-Muren, or Yellow
River, which on the Mongolian plateau
Is a part of the Llauho and which
flows into the Gulf of Liaotunsr. finds
the sea where stands the Important
city of Newchwang. The Llauho was
at all times an important waterway,
the river flowing close to the city of
Mukden.
The surface of Manchuria is extreme
ly varied, with its sandy wastes, its
grassy steppes, rich arable lands and
dense forest tracts. In a region
stretching east of the Great Khlngan
the monsoons from the Pacific are ar
rested by the lofty Shanalin highlands,
which receive most c'^-the moisture.
This necessarily makes arid the re
gion beyond. But proceeding eastward
the soil, benefited by the cloud-bearing
sea breezes, is rich in vegetation, and
the forests and streams are the home
of wild beasts and fowl.
Most of the North Manchurian
mountains are green to the peaks,
while the valleys abound in Impene
trable forests of oak, elm and willow.
In South Manchuria nearly all
the arable lands have -been re
claimed and vegetation Is less
dense. South of Mukden the
seaward route traverses a thickly
populated district Although icebound
for four or five months of the year the
trade has rapidly increased. Cotton,
raw filk, hemp, pea oil and coal are
exported from this point. The whole of
South Manchuria abounds in coal and
the mines In the hills southeast of
Mukden supply the towns and metal
works of the surrounding districts.
The coal is also used by the steamers
plying in the Yellow Sea, and Is said
to be superior to that of Japan and
equal to the best Cardiff.
Altogether one would call the
country of Manchuria Â» exceedingly
fertile. Agriculture is the chief occu
pation of the people. The products are
beans and Â«peas. More attention has
been lately devoted to wheat
and other cereals, cotton, indigo, to
bacco and poppy, the native-grown
opium having almost completely sup
planted the Indian drug. The mineral
wealth is very great. A gold mine on
the lower Sungarl River is being
worked by the Government, private
mining being forbidden. The manufac
tures are unimportant. Some cottyn
cloth and silk are made for home
consumption and soda is prepared on
the steppes of the Sungari. There are
salmon fisheries on the lower. Sungari
and the Hurka, where great quantities
of ftsh are dried for the winter. Dis
tilleries are numerous and bean oil is
extracted, which forms the staple ex
port- Very fine sable, tiger and lynx
skins, ginseng: and deer horns are
among the other products
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1904.
WILHELM
IS PIQUED
AT PRINCE
Kaiser's Son Talks of
Renouncing His
Rights.
BERLIN, Feb. 20.- â There is one
thing which interests the people of
Berlin much more than the troubles
in the Far East, and that is the do
mestic war between the Kaiser . and
the Crown Prince, who has shown a
strong inclination to have his own will
in everything.
HÂ£ is now 22 years of age, and
thinks that the time has come for him
to declare his independence.
When he first started in to show
that he was far from agreeing with
his august father in matters of impor
tance it was a very severe shock to
u>Â« ivuiser, who in broad German told
him to shut up.
The conflict became acute when the
Kaiser told the Prince that as an of
ficer he had to obey his superior or he
would run the risk of being court mar
tialed. . â¢
The Crown Prince, with all the hot
headedness of a true Hohenzollern,
answered, stamping his feet:
"As a lieutenant In the German army
I know perfectly weir that I owe you
obedience in military matters, but as a
German, even If an officer, I have the
right to associate with whom I please,
visit whatever theaters I please. You,
yourself, was none too obedient to your
father when at my age you resented
his Interference in your private affairs
just as much as I do, and I want to tell
you that if I am not allowed to develop
my own Individuality I shall resign
from the army, and If you force me to
do this I swear that I will never again
wear a German uniform. Should this
not help I can always emigrate and
choose my homekin London, Paris or in
the United States, where I will be free
to live as a human* being and not sim
ply be clockwork." .
This response for once silenced the
Kaiser, who remained speechless for
several minutes; then, trying to be
calm, told his oldest son that if he were
a simple German subject his reasoning
would be perfectly proper, but that as
Crown Prince and future ruler of Ger
many there were other laws which he
must obey.
To this, however, the Prince replied
that he was human before he was royal
and that he would rather renounce his
rights to the throne and be free than to
be a crowned slave all his life.

TkJTAKCHURIA, that great pioviucc of the Chinese empire, over which Russia and Japan are

tion of the province and comparisons in latitude with various points on the Pacific Coast. This vast
domain, bordering Siberia and alluring to Russia because it would give the latter country desirable
Pacific seaports, is the price of all the districts in the Orient. In point of position it is the key to
a great stretch of country noiv practically unknown to the world. As showing the sice of this mag

PADEREWSKI SHOWS
DEFIANCE TO KAISER
Famous Pianist Will Not Allow .His
Latest Opera to Be Suns In a
German Theater.
WARSAW, Feb. 20.â Paderewskl, the
grtat pianist and composer, is the hero
and Idol of Poland.' To show his dis
approval of the harsh measures adopted
by the Kaiser in German Poland, he re
cently forbade his new opera, "Manru,"
to be produced in any German theater.
This is said to have greatly annoyed
the Kaiser, who is reported to have
sent a letter to Pederewski asking him
to reconsider his action. It Is not
known E exactly what Paderewski an â¢
swered the Kaiser, but he is reported
to have said to a personal ffiend tHat
as long as the Polish language was not
good enough to be used in Germany he
did not see why Polish music should
also be excluded, as it might jar
upon Prussian ears.

LONDON PLANS RELIEF
FOR CONGESTED TRAFFIC
Many Suj;jrestions Arc Offered. One of
Which Provides for Two Great
Thoroughfares.
LONDON, Feb. 20.â How to relieve
London's congested streets is a prob
lem the authorities have long tried to
solve. Some novel proposals were made
to deal with the difficulty where the
London traffic commissioners met this
week.
The only way to solve it, declared
Charles Scott Meik, was by making
new roads. Two great arterial thor
oughfares, running respectively from
north to south, and east and west, were
of the first Importance. They should
pass as close as possible to the large
railway termini and other congested
centers. Special provision, he said,
should be made for through traffic and
automobiles.
Mr. Meik suggested the double deck
construction of roads, the upper deck
being reserved for fast vehicles, in
cluding automobiles, and the lower for
slower and heavy traffic?- To reach the
upper deck certain secondary streets
should be connected with it. The double
decked road should be within the four
mile radius.
A suspended railway running along
the new thoroughfares was proposed.
The cost would be $375,000 a mile,
whereas shallow underground railways
cost $1,250,000 a mile and tubes $1,750,
000 a mile.
The total cost of the two main ave
nues was estimated by Mr. Meik at
$355,930,000, but recoupment from the
sale of surplus lands would bring the
net cost down. to $106,555,000. He esti
mated the net yearly revenues from
rail and tramways at $8,123,750.
Novel Lights in Pnris.
PARIS, Feb. 20.â At the annual pic

the son of the great artist, Fortuny.
This system of refracted- light Is almost
as satisfactory as sunlight.

Grand Recording Secretary Dr.
Charles M. Troppmann in the recent
past paid an official visit to the court
in Saratoga, where, after viewing the
work by the officers and examining the
business methods, he delivered a most
interesting talk on the order and urged
the membership, of the court to use its
best endeavors to help the good work
that is now in progress. At the close
of the meeting he was the guest of
honor at a banquet. He visited the
court at Colma and there was received
with a most cordial forestic welcome,
and there, too, after one of those ad
dresses along fraternal lines which
have of- late made him famous in the
order, he was given the post of honor
at a banquet. He also visited Courts
Yerba Buena and Barbarossa, at each
of which he created a good impres
sion by his suggestions for the welfare
of the courts and the order.
On the occasion of Supreme Chief
Ranger Kelly's visit to Oakland he was
received by a goodly representation of
the courts of that city and to keep in

ed by the names of the courts of that
city.

Great Sachem J. Samuels as sachem,
conferred the chief's degree on forty
seven warriors of Calumet Tribe in the
Post-street wigwam February 15 in
the presence of a large number of in

which this degree was given was proof
that the 'members of the team havo
grasped the idea of the author of the
ritual in its fullest sense and by word
of mouth and by act conveye'd the
meaning of the language to those war
riors who were exalted. The work
was very Impressive.

A select few of San Francisco Circle
of the Women of Woodcraft a fe\v
evenings since surprised the general
membership in Mission Masonic Hall
by Inviting all to a delicious banquet,
and then the. circle surprised the neigh
bors of San Francisco Camp, which
meets in the same building, by march
ing in a body, headed by the drill team,
to the meeting* place and demanding
admission. The neighbors seized their
axes to repel .what they thought was
an assault, but decided first to send
out an envoy with a rlag of truce.
Upon his report that it was a friendly
visit the neighbors surrendered. Mrs.
J. Welch, on behalf of the circle, in
vited the camp to close without cere
mony and join the circle at its ban
quet. The offer was accepted and in
a short time all were enjoying a feast.
As special guest the circle had Mrs. D.
Oliver Jr., of California Circle, who in
a most welcome guest wherever she
visits. In response to^Mrs. Welch, who
was the toastmistress, there were many
witty remarks. Mrs. Oliver, in a short
speech," said that the neighbors of the
circles are not the "ladies" but the
"women" of Woodcraft, for they are all
engaged in woman's great work, the
elevation of the human race and teach
ing It to protect itself.
After the speechmaking there was an
hour of games and dancing. The affair
was admirably managed by. the com
mittee consisting of Mrs. J. Welch, Mrs.
K. Love, Miss J. Barson, Mrs. J. Spen
cer and M. Eberling.

upon one candidate who was extremely
anxious to receive it. The work of that
degree impressed him so that he de
clared that he will secure a number
of candidates who shall enjoy it as he
did.
The Valentine party given by Red
wood Circle, W. of W., on the third

At a meeting of California Council of
the Daughters of Liberty on the first
Wednesday, in February, the ninth an
niversary of the institution of the

Grand Recorder^ Spencer report*
unusual activity in the order in this
State during January in the matter
of reinstatements and the acquisition
of new members. The reinstatement
of members in. the older ages who
had dropped out because of th^
change of rates has been remarkable
and the attendance of members at
lodge meetings in all parts of the ju
risdiction is now larger than it has
been for years. He also reports that
the receipts in the beneficiary branch
are greater than they have ever been
in the history of the order.
The grand recorder visited Los An
geles on February 11, where during
the afternoon he opened a school of
instruction for the recorders and re
ceivers of the lodges in that locality,
in order to instruct them in the new
work of keeping accounts.

The visit of Grand Regent Gunzen
dorfer to the councils in Los Angele3
has aroused an unusual activity in the
membership there, as appears from the
results.
The net gain in California during
1903 was 17.7 per cent, the best record
of any jurisdiction in the order.
Angeleno Council of Los Angeles has
been initiating candidates right along
and it expects to carry away the Grand
Council prize banner. Buena Vista
Council, of which the grand resent is
a member, is also striving for the ban
ner, and in view of the fact that for
several years past the banner has been
awarded alternately to north and
south and that this year it is due north
it should come to Buena Vista from the
south. ;-*.â¢â¢;â¢

The difficult is always attract! vp â not
aew? At least it is true. Certainly the
fact that Lillian Russell had prattled
of a prejudice for the newspaper wo
:i".an added piquancy to my intention tw
interview her. Besides, when should I
ever again get the chance to chat with
the heroine of a cigar label? Poets
may sing her, painters paint, sculptors
mold, and Vet the skeptic may doubt
the charm of loveiy woman. Even she
may be of the chosen whose word goes
Â»n a cold cream jar and one's stubborn
imagination still- remain untouched. I
have myself continued cold in the pres
ence of the frescoed original of a pou
dre de riz label. But when you get her
who has been canonized on a cigar
wrapper, whose lovely phiz has been
chosen to bejewel the dusk and fra
grant gold of the sacred weed, whose
smile is the last to bless before the in
timate sanctity of a two-bit nirvana
(arc they two bits, Lillian?) â you may
be pretty sure you have the real thing.
For "A woman is only a woman, but a
good ciirar is a smoke."
It was not long before I found myself
enviously inquiring whether she would
rathvr bÂ« the adored of cigarolatry or
the patron saint of a racehorse. Bloat
edâor rather bantedâ monopolist, she
is both' She saidâ but I anticipate.
What persuaded Miss Russell to add
me to her collection of newspaper wo
men I do not know. Possibly what im
pelled me to add her to my gallery of
beautiesâ business and -a little curios
ity. The affair was even a little dis
appointingly easy. The lions in the
f>ath said "Hoiv-d'ye-do" and showed
me behind scenes to her dressing-room.
Miss Russell herself shouted a cheery
"Come in!" in spite of the feminine
warning of my card. "Why, yes. if you
like," ehe said in response to my re
quest for a chat, and for the following
Â«*vening it was arranged.
N<5w, there are questions as eminent
ly proper for the interviewer to ask on
fome occasions a? they are sinfully in
appropriate on others. For example, to
neglect to ask the weight of Isadore
Rush, who, when I saw her last year,
had just achieved a laborious and
graceful Flump from 152 to 114 pounds,
would have been sheer cruelty. Con
trarily with Miss Russell, of whom
there is not a handsome ounce too
muchâ though a few more than of Miss
â¢Rush â the query would be as obvious
ly maladroit. "Wrinkles, I knew, from
the experience of my fore-sisters, were
taboo. Also grandmammas. Husbands,
too, perhaps! The races were open.
Also art. But we should see.
'"Is she really as handsome as they
Â«ay?" the artist asked confidentially as
we slipped in at the stage door of the
CJrand Opera-house.
"'Wait and see," I laughed.
"But what do you think?" he per
sisted.
"I'm a newspaper woman â "
"Pshaw â pardon me â **
"Well, Ifâ I hastily whisperedâ "If
Miss Russell is at all like the glimpse
of her I got last night, she's one of the
most stunningly handsome creatures
I've ever seen â ah, good evening, Miss
Russell."
My confrere's confirmatory gasp as
he took the trunk allotted to him amus
ed but did not amaze me. If Miss Rus
sell is radiant at long range she Is
<Jazz!ins at close range. The night was
brilliant outside, stars sharply a-glit
ter against the clean velvet of the
winter sky; but when the door of the
Kussell dressing-room opened the ef
fect was incandescent by contrast. Such
a pirakness of round cheek and small,
curved ear, thin as a shell! Such red
and rose of lip and palm! Such sheen
of kind gray eyes and white teeth, the
imperial blaze of diamonds, sad flame
hi emeralds, the pale luster of pearls!
Such warm whiteness of neck and
m .shoulder! Such glow and shimmer and
softness of silk and fur and lace! And,
above all. such sunny laughterâ that is
.responsible for the only wrinkles that
Miss Russell owns.
She had seated herself In the fullest
claro of the electric lights with which
;hÂ°. little room is studded, the artist
opposite, I at her side. A tiny snift
at my feet set the conversational ball
Â«i-rolling.
'"That is Mootsie," Miss Russell ex
plained, as a small black and white
face, large eyed and scantily benosed,
made its appearance over my knee on
its v.'ay to my lap. "She doesn't often
â¦ake to strangers."
"Now, Hiss Russell â "
"Its true," she laughed.
"It looks as though she had been
Trained to be nice to the interviewer,"
as the little creature, worth its $1000
or so a pound, nestled" contentedly
npainst my furs â "even the female in
rterviewcr." I added slyly.
"Now," Miss Russell laughed, "you
mustn't take me too seriously there.
Some of the newspaper women are
among my best friends. But there are
stupid people among them, as there
3 re among every class â and I've met
a few of them lately. They always be
gin by asking me how I keep the
wrinkles away, and look at me aa
though I were a specimen wriggling
on a pin. I guess I've plenty of time
for wrinkles yet.''
â¢Tve heardâ If I may?â that thÂ»
Christian Scientists claim you as an
example of the salutary effects of their
creed?"
â¢â¢I do believe in Christian Science,"
Miss Kussell owned frankly. "It's good
cornrnonsense. We think ourselves into
â¢most of the sickness we have, and why
not think ourselves out of it? Every
one knows that worry ages. The sci
entist refuses to worry. It's good
' ;ommor.fense."
The actress was even then engaged
*in "thinking herself out" of. a cold.
Libe Voltaire, however, she seems to
. believe in "incantations and ointment,"
taking a little phenacetine ftrr the ac
companying headache's sake. It may
â¢iiave been Christian Science, or sheer.
innle, natural sweetness, but with
every pesky symptom of the grip she
Y/as good humor and self-forgetful
courtesy itself. She went out into the
v.ings later with never a â¢ wrap upon
her bared shoulders, and philosophic
ally declared she "would be better to
morrow, though she was sorry there
v. ~uld l>e a matinte ' as well as the
evening performance."
"Now, you know," she went on coz
lly. "it I were in Sew York I should
just gc up frcr.t and say to the audi
ence, 'awfully sorry I have such a cold
to-night â you know how it is your
self,' " with a grlppy snuffle that
brought tears to my eyes.
"Do it here," I advised.
"I don't know you well enough," Miss
Russell demurred. "You see, they know
me there when I haven't a cold."
"Isn't this bis theater rather uncom
fortable after the little Weber &. Fields
hcruse?"
"That's just it." the actress said. "At
our theater we can lean over and shake
hands with the people in the boxes.
Sometimes do. Why, Peter â "
"You mean Pete â "
"We call him 'Peter,' " â gravely â
"will say, â¢Hello, Sheriff,' or any other
person he happens to see, and make
a song up about him right on the spot,
under h's very nose. You can't do that
with yc-ur audience half a mile away."
"Mr. Dailey gets no -thinner under it."
"No; and he always has some new
remedy," Miss Russell laughed. She
looked down a little consciously at her
own plump shoulders as ehe added:
"He came in just now to tell me he
had found a sure cure for one's super
fluous self â a sort of rubber band that
you rub all over you."
The shoulders reminded of the sea
green gown that rippled up to them,
and Miss Russell asked: "Do you like
gowns?"
"Even a female reporter â "
"Bosh!" she said; and to the smiling
maid: "Get out the gray dress, Mar
garet."
Margaret obediently exhibited a
dream in gray point de Venise, then
a Redfern creation in winey rose tints,
a white miracle of embroidered silk,
and so on.
"Paris?" I asked.
"Yes."
"But home industry â "
"Style, my dear â "
"They fit as well in New Yorkâ"
"Better. It is not that. Look here,"
and Miss Russell's five feet six or so
rose royally before me. "This was de
signed for me by the Sisters of
Paris. Isn't there something â ?"
"There certainly is," I acquiesced
heartily. And there certainly was. The
gown was designed in deep sea
tints, all clear, cool greens, with a
gracile arabesque of strange sea flow
ers and starry-eyed fish, and the cav
ernous grreen of emeralds as garniture,
the whole fitting like the skin of a mer
maiden.
"You go over to Paris for them?"
"No, Worth, Paquin"â I forget the
rest â "all have a model of me. Some
times I can put the dresses right on
â¢without the slightest alteration. Why,
Mootsie!"
I had been using part of Mootsie as
a tablet and she objected here. "How
did you manage to get Mootsie into the
Pullman?" I asked then.
"Oh. I hadn't any trouble about
that" â Miss Russell's unconsciousness
was all but absolute â "why, the conduc
tor could hardly keep away from her!
Achew! Your nice California weather!"
"How did this happen?" I said.
"Well â it was yesterday," the actress
owned. "It rained, you know. Oh, I
love a rainy day at the races! There's
no one there much, and it's so fresh
and pleasant. I was all over the ground
at Ingleside yesterday. In the hospital
where the little fellows are looked after
when they get hurt, everywhere."
"How did you come out?"
"Oh, I won," she laughed, "to-day,
too, J165."
"You lost on Gloriosa last Saturday."
I said, darkly. I had had what Miss
Russell calls a "straight tip" to the
effect.
"But I won $100 during the day," she
laughed again, after giving due meed
of surprise to my omniscience.
"Do you really know how to bet, I
mean how to choose a good horse? Or
Is it just chance?"
Miss Russell leaned forward earnest
ly and said: "No one can tell, you know.
One follows â I follow â the records of a
horse and usually bet according 1 to
those. But sometimes I bet just be
cause I like the looks of the horse, or
the name of it, and I come out just as
well as the rest."
Newly wise, I venture then: "It is
only another form of speculation?"
"And you have a quicker finish for
your money," the fair speculator main
tained. "If you go in for stocks you
never know where you're going to coma
out. A race settles It right there."
"You're really very fond of racing?"
"It's fascinating." Miss Russell
owned. "If you win you want to bet
again to make more, and if you lose
you want to bet again to make your
loss good. Still, if I lose the first two
races I go lightly. If I win I what we
call 'force my luck' â bet more."
"What was the most you ever wonâ
If I may?"
"Certainly. Well, I won $6000 once on
Princelet. But that was a 40 to 1 bet.
The most I ever lost was 5400."
"I think you should give me the
'straight tip,' for to-morrow's race," I
suggest. *->v."
"Did you ever bet?"
"A pair of gloves on Fabiola day in
Oakland."
"Isn't that dear?" she laughed. "Well,
I think if you wager a pair of gloves
on Lord Melbourne or My Order to
morrow" (this was for Wednesday)
"you will win them."
I solemnly jotted down the names,
but have not yet looked to see if my
gloves would have 'been safe. Then I
said guiltily: "We haven't talked art at
all.^Miss Russell. Won't you tell me
why Lillian Russell's address has been
Weber and Fields for the last five
years?"
"Mostly because Weber and Fields
spells New York," Miss Russell put it.
"It is not an inordinate passion for
burlesque then?"
"Hardly." the once comic opera
queen demurred. Of course I like
Weber and Fields, they're both the
finest of their kind, but one gets very
little individual opportunity for shin
ing in the burlesque work."
"Why thenâ?"
"Why then stay in it? Because â "
Miss Russell's smile was at its most
lazily good-tempered here, her atmos
phere of easy well-being at its most
pervasive, her opulent channs most
luxuriously in evidence, "because my
home is New York, because we leave it

only for a few weeks, And I'm afraid
because I like a good, easy time.
Shocking, isn't it?"
"One has heard of such cases before.
How long is your New York season?"
"Thirty-five weeks. The rest of the
time we put in In one-night stands in
Cincinnati, Pitt^burg, Philadelphia, and
so on. The remainder of the time we
rest. I go to my own home in Far
Rockawayâ it's only twenty-nine min
utes from New York."
"Did you begin in comic opera?" I
asked.
Miss Russell clasped her firm, white
handsâ languid, womanly, friendly
hands, they are â and turned . up her
eyes as she replied: "No, I began in
ballads, at Tony Pastor's. It was he
who put me on in comic opera, in an
abridged version of the 'Pirates of
Penzance.' After that I sang in any
number of them, 'Olivette,' 'Blllee Tay
lor,' 'La Grande Duchesse,' etc., indefi
nitely."
"You have heard our local comic op
era?"
"Oh, yes! And you don't get a chorus
anywhere like the Tivoli's in New York,
such fresh, well-trained, fine voices."
Mi3S Russell's blonde head, with its
snowy feathers and lace, nodded much
more vigorously than Is its wont.
"Thank you," I said; "we're all proud
of the Tivoll."
"Mr. Steindorff was my conductor for
five years â splendid fellow!" she con
tinued.
I again subscribed and asked then:
"What role do you like best?"
"La Grande Duchesse," the actress
said with emphasis. And can't you
imagine It?
Her chin lifted with a comically regal
air as she spoke.
"Some day, perhaps, I may go back
to it," she sighed. .
"Your daughter is on the stage?"
"Hardly," laughed her mother. "You
know she's married? Ran away, you
know. And just IS. But it doesn't
make any difference. We go shopping
together, it's 'mommer* this and 'mom
mer' that, just the same as though she
weren't' married. About the stage?
She went on for a week a little while
ago 'with Amelia Bingham in 'Olympe,'
but she decided she had had enough in
a week. Her husband's a fine fellow."
I murmured: "I can't understand how
he could see daughter when 'mamma
was around.' "
"She's very prettyâ at least I think
soâ" mamma hastily said.
And Margaret nodded an emphatic
"yes" as the call boy called her mis
tress stageward. â 
We watched her then lighting up
the stage with her beauty and big,
warm personality, evidently the idol
of the whole company, and as evident
ly comfortably and vividly interested
in them all. In fact, I have found few
stage folk more simply friendly, fewer
more innocent of "side," less self-con
scious than Miss Russell.
"Well 7 " I asked the artist as we left.
He said: "She's a wonder. I think
she's the most beautiful woman I ever
sawâ and I'm going to tell my wife
so!"
THE WEEK PROMISES
MANY GOOD THINGS

NOTES 'ABOUT ACTORS'
AND SOME GOSSIP
OF THEATER WORLD
Those who enjoyed Justin Huntly
McCarthy's pleasant romance "If I
"Were King," as -played by E. H. Soth
ern, will be pleased to learn that the
writer has prepared a new play espe
cially for Mary Mannering. It is said
that the actress hopes to have the
drama In readiness for the first per
formance to b*e given during her forth
coming engagement at the Columbia
Theater.
Richard Mansfield will shortly pro
duce in New York the new play enti
tled "Ivan the Terrible." The actor ex
pects to produce the play during his
Western tour, alternating it with his
other production, "Old Heidelberg."
Mansfield, who is to bring his
massive production of "Old Heidel
berg" here later in the season, early
last year mapped out the present tour,
which is the most extensive he has
ever undertaken. The present itiner
ary embraces 16,000 miles, and though
there are only nine one-night stands,
the larger cities only being privileged
to see the distinguished actor and liis
great success, he will not finish his
season until the 15th of June. Up to
the first of March only four cities will
have been visited, "Old Heidelberg"
enjoying long runs in New York, Chi
cago, Boston and Philadelphia. Then
he visits the South, New Orleans, the
Middle West and the Pacific Coast,
playing San Francisco for the first time
in nine years. Although more than 100
people appear in "Old Heidelberg,"
Mansfield employs no local supers. The
great number of people is largely made
up of a chorus of men, his numerous
working staff to manipulate the heavy
settings and the principal artists of his
company. Every hour of the tour is
now scheduled. Mansfield will live on
his private car; there will be three
sleepers for the company and three
cars for the scenery and baggage.
National Union.
San Francisco Council of the Na
tional Union has removed from the
Red Men's building to the Native Sons'
building, and at its first meeting there,
February 18, three candidates were in
itiated, after which there was a pro
gressive . whist party.
Columbia ( Assembly, Ladies of the
National Union, at its last held session,
which was on a very wet night, had
an attendance of more than forty,mem
bers. There was a business session,
after which the social feature was a
card party, .progressive whist. The
members of this" new. organization are
working actively to make it one of
the most attractive social fraternal as
sociations in this city.
Berkeley Council gave a reception
and muslcale to its members and
friends In I. O. O. F. building in Berke-
ley on February 15, which proved to
be a most delightful function. The At
tendance was large and the programme
of vocal and instrumental music was
most enjoyable. rÂ» ;
EI Dorado Council, after the termi
nation of business on the 16th of Feb
ruary, had a pleasant evening of en
tertainment under the direction of
Speaker Sanders. There was an inter
esting programme of music, songs,
story telling, adventure and specialties
which kept the membersh^p.in good hu
mor for two hours. A collation was.
served
Order of Pendo.
The councils in Los Angeles and vi
cinity are being visited at this time
by Supreme Councilor Tugwell, who
will remain in that locality for two
weeks.
Supreme Secretary Terry has re
turned from his visit In Grants Pass,
Or., where he spent several days in
the interest of the organization.
A new council, called "Home," or
ganized by Deputy E. E. White, was
instituted in this city in A. O. F. Hall
by the supreme officers last week with
a charter list of fifty. The new coun
cil has absorbed the membership of
Enterprise Council.
Berkeley Council of Lorin orr the
evening of February 9 installed its of
ficers for the current term and then
initiated a class of ten strangers. On
the following night Oakland Council
also installed its officers and initiated
twenty applicants for admission. The
latter were secured through the ef
forts of Mrs. Hanavan, an energetic
member of the council.
1 Alameda Council has arranged for
an entertainment on March 1.
The Fraternals.
Oakland Lodge of the Fraternal
Brotherhood at its meeting last week
after business entered upon the first *>l
a series of ten games of progressive
whist. The prizes are a gold watcn for
the. gentleman who is declared the win -
ner and a Ladles' gold watch for the
lady winner.
Columbia Lodge at its last held meet
ing received sis applications, Aurora
Lodge received a like number and Mis
sion Lodge received five.
All the local lodges are actively at
work and each is striving to make a
better record than the other.
Progress Lodge will give a Dolly Var
den party in the assembly hall of the
Red Men's building on Wednesday.
The latest word of symphony matters
is hopeful if peculiar. But symphony
there is to be, which after all i3 the
question. It is doubtful if Herr Scheel
will come this year under the auspices
of the San Francisco Symphony So
ciety, under the business auspices, that
is. There seems to be a large though
friendly disagreement as to the fit and
proper fashion of conducting the af
fairs of the society, that will probably
result in the symphony concerts tak
ing place this year under the manage
ment of "Will E. Greenbaum. Mr. Green
baum has se'veral plans for the hand
ling of the coming season. Most im
portant, it is likely that Mr. Scheel will
be advised to bring with him some
eighteen or twenty men to reinforce
the local orchestra. For the consequent
expense a series of popular concerts,
such as were so genuinely popular some
years ago under Mr. Scheel's leader
ship, will probably be arranged. The
financial difficulty is the only one at
the basis of the symphony troubles.
If such means for obviating this dif
ficulty as the series of popular con
certs could be successfully brought
about, the problem is solved.
The plan Is to make these tributary
concerts popular in programme, to give
them say three evenings in the week,
and to turn the selected concert hall
for the time being into a continental
cafe. It is a scheme presenting fe^r
difficulties and many advantages. One
remembers vividly Mr. Scheel's delight
ful Vienna orchestra at the Midwinter
Fair. With the visiting artists the pro
posed concerts would be of equally at
tractive caliber, morally certain of suc
cess. "We have nothing of the kind
here and it is possible that the fact
that in supporting the popular concerts
the visitor would be giving the most
substantial help to the symphony sea
son would prove no small factor in
the success of the series. It is un
necessary to dwell upon the improve
ment inevitable in the local orchestra
with . the importation of new blood.
We know our weaknesses, and there
Is evident a graceful and sensible de
sire to remedy them. The above plan
carried through would undoubtedly in
sure us a symphony season of a kind
we have hardly dared to hope for, an
earnest of what sure'y will be ours,
in spite of much discouragement, be
fore so many years have gtme.
The musical programme of the com
ing week includes that of the farewell
concert of Donald de V. Graham, that
will take place on Saturday evening
next at Stelnwav Hall. There has been
a very interesting programme or
ranged, in which the following artists,
with Mr. Graham, will take part: Mme.
Camille D'Arvllle. Mrs. M. E. Blanch
ard. Mrs. H. M. Gillig and Nathan
Lands berger.
The engagement of the Scottish Band,
called the "Kilties," begins Tuesday
night, February 23, at the Alhambra
Theater. Concerts will be given every,
night until the end of the week, Sun
day included, and matinees on Wednes
day, Friday, Saturday and Sunday,
when special rates for children will be
made. The following selections will be
played the opening night: Overture,
"Rosamunde," by Schubert; Scotch,
fantasla/'Robert Bruce,' by Boinnseau;
ballet music from "Sylvia," by Delibes;
"Moorish Intermezzo," by Arnold; in
cidental music to "Nell Gwyn," by Ed
ward German; selections from "Prince
of Pilsen" and other popular numbers."
Besides these numbers by the band the
choir of sixteen voices will sing "Annie
Laurie" and other part songs, and the
tenor will sing "The Bonnie Lass o*
Ballochmyle." The Johnstone troupe
will dance the "Reel o' Tulloch, "Irish
Jig" and sword dance. The programme
will be changed at every performance
and a comparison with any band pro
grammes ever given here will result in
a verdict for the Kilties. Prices for
the engagement will be popular.
â¢ The second novelty concert by the
Kopta Quartet and Mrs. Oscar Mans
feldt will be given this afternoon at
Lyric Hall. The novelty for the occa
sion will be a string quartet by God
ard, the brilliant French composer.
Mrs. Birmingham will sing a group of
songs, including compositions by Al
bert Elkus, the young Callfornian
composer, who will'play the accompani
ments. The titles of the Elkus songa
are "The Kmg of Thule" and "AI
Raschid.' The final concert of the first
series of these concerts will be given
on Sunday, March 13, when the Richard
Strauss Piano Quartet will receive its
first production on this coast.
Great Interest is being taken in the
concerts to be given by Harold Bauer,
the pianist, at Lyric Hall on Tuesday
and Thursday nights, March 1 and 3.
and Saturday afternoon, the 5th. Bauer
originally appeared before the public
as a violinist, but always . evinced
great planistic talent One evening
when in his company Paderewski was
so delighted with the wonderful tone â
color and Quality of the young aftlst'a
touch that he strongly advised him to
forsake his career as a violinist and
make a specialty of the piano. Bauer
did so, and the result is now known all
over the world. At his first concert here,
Bauer's programme will include the ~F
sharp minor sonata of Schumann, a
work rarely attempted in public, al
though all pianists know and study it.
Other important numbers will be "The
Fantasia," by Chopin, and Liszt's
"Mephisto 'Waltz." Seats will be on sale
next Saturday morning, February 27,
at Sherman. Clay & Co.'s, where com
plete programmes for the three recitals
may be obtained.
Order of St. George.
Empress , Victoria Lodge of the
Daughters of St. George will have a
leap year social and dance in its hall
in the Red Men's building on the even
ing of February 30. Mrs. Ethel Flack
has been selected as- chairman of an
able committee that has been appoint
ed to look after the details of this af
fair. Many of the members of the
lodges of the Sons of St. Geor*e have
signified their Intention to be present.
1920
Blessed "be the Lenten days â the
>xray days â for they shall be filled with
peace â and incidentally with a re
â¢Kumption of normal living. The hearth
that hath but seldom seen its mistress
in the passing months will know her
now in her langorous robes of ease,
and husband, babes and friends are
likewise happy. And as for the buds
and belles, the surcease is welcome â
for behold the damaged hats, the limp
chiffons, the dingy frocks â and alas!
alas! the sadly damaged epidermis,
â¢whence the rose-tint has faded Cand
it's horribly bad form now to reinforce
it from the druggist's).
Thus Lent is more far-reaching than
the religious phase of it would imply.
It brings more than periodical prayer
and penitence and alms-giving â it
brings reflections and retrospections,
and the mental and moral blessings
that are developed by these beneficent
processes.
But think you, O reader, that the
maids and matrons of the smart set
will follow a monkish mode of living
through the whole forty days of
Lent? Ah! no; there are to be quiet
little luncheons â no formal invita
tions, of course â just "telephone" af
fairs â teas, bridge parties, bowling
parties, auto excursions and informal
dinners, likewise a few receptions. But
as for dancing parties, there are none
permissible, save the time-honored Mi
careme in mid-Lent.
How, indeed, would the votaries of
bridge relegate their pet diversion to
oblivion for six long weeks? How, in
deed, could Mrs. Moun-tford Wilson.
Mrs. Chauncey Winslov, Mrs. Robert
Oxnard, Mrs. Georse Gibbs, Mrs.
Frank Carolan, Mrs. Hyde-Smith â
among the cleverest at King Ed
ward's game â forsake their delightful
afternoons and evenings? But why
should they? Is it not more in keep
ing with Christian virtue to play
bridge, or euchre, or any old game â
so long as it is honestly playedâ than
to spend the hours dissecting the char
acters and lives of our dear "friends"?
It is whispered from somewhere â
but of course it lacks confirmation â
that women players do â occasionally
â bolt the s^irne for a wee bit of gos
sip. But that really cannot be â at
least not where the stakes run high!
â¢ â¢ â¢
â What a week this has been! As for
Monday and Tuesday, there wasn't a
cab in town that was not in com
mission â galloping here and there for

the day's social programme were three
noon weddings, the Greenfield-Cook af
fair, the nuptials of Mrs. Helen-Walker
Tay and Judge Henshaw arid the Dib

The Mardi Gras! Who will forget
itâ the kaleidoscope of peoples, colors,
lights, and the laughter, the music, the

lovely women! Such daring women!
Who but. a woman of distinction, of
personality, would â or could â wear
the ballet costume of Miss Hagerâ
and didn't' she wear it brilliantly?
Then there was Miss Grace Llewellyn
Jonesâ she who portrayed painting.
Was she not a picture in her lavender
satin gown "and her* palette hat, en
shrouded in lavender tulle?
Then there -was the lovely Miss Polly
Tongue of Portland, Ore., daughter of
Congressman Tongue, now deceased.
A regnant belle in the Northwest and
latterly in "Washington, D. C, Miss
Tongue is possessed of a statuesque
figure which, in her Martha Washing
ton costume, made her one of the con
spicuous figures on the floor.
Who were the "hoosiers" â the wo
men in linen dusters, a few wisps of
hair braided after the style of the
German peasant, and a battered' hat
of the first vintage of "dudes"? Whj?
Look through the A's. and you will
have one, at least. But when she doff

she was in a white chiffon gown!
Mrs. Lewis Pierce, formerly Aline
Ford, was a pretty creature to contem

her slender figure. So, too, was Mrs.
Francis Carolan, in her gown of night.
Miss Gertrude Dutton was a fetch-

ARE AMERICANS 3IORE
ARTISTIC THAX EXGUSH
LONDON, Feb. IS. â "Are Americans
artistic?" is the heading which at
tracts the eye in an evening paper to
day, the query being prompted by the
eagerness of American buyers to se
cure valuable books and manuscripts
from this country, and the prodigious
number of such treasures which In late
years have found a home in the Unite.1
States.
Various explanations, It Is said, are
found In this particular sign of the
times. Many people frankly assert
that the wealthy American looks upon
a rare book in the light of a good in
vestment for his money. Others ac
cuse him of buying it because, it is ex
pensive.
A representative of a famous firm
of antique book sellers which has sent
across the Atlantic more rare vol
umes than anyLody else, has suggest
ed a far different reason. "The sim
ple fact of the matter," he said, "i3
that Americans are more artistic than

EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA
BANISHES HIS BROTHER
VIENNA, Feb. 20.â Archduke Lud
v.ig, the Emperor's brother, and Arch
duke Otto, his nephew, have been tem
porarily banished by the Emperor, who
is incensed at a scandal in which his
brother was Implicated. He drove t;>
the Archduke's palace and reprimanded
him. Ludwig was engaged in a brawl
in a public bath, subsequent police
court proceedings proving the Arch
duke was knocked down by a youth.
The latter was accused of the assault
and acquitted.
The Emperor banished his brother to
Meran, compelling him to resign several
offices. The Arehduke's palace Is for
sale, and obviously, his banishment is
for a long term. Archduke Otto ha3
gone to Ragusca nominally for his
health, but it is reported his devotion
to an actress has aroused the Emperor's
ire and made him unwelcome at court.
The courtship of Archduke Ferdinand
Carl, who was infatuated with Pro
fessor Czuber's daughter, has been In
terrupted by the Emperor. The Arch
duke left Prague to-day for a long tour
abroad. Society is wondering whether
the Archduke ultimately will keep hhs
pledge to marry Fraulein Czuber.
TAMING OF LIONS A
RESPECTABLE VOCATION
PARIS. Feb. 20.â The Supreme Court
of Paris has decided that lion taming
is a respectable occupation and that a
young lady may be fittingly brought
up to the business.
This decision was handed down as
the outcome of an action by Vicomte
de Vesins, from whom his wife, the
daughter of -a millionaire cigar manu
facturer, had obtained a divorce some
years ago, the decree giving her the
custody of the two children.
The Countess took to lion taming,
and the Count applied to the court to
have the custody of a daughter, who
assists her mother in her dangerous
profession, intrusted to him, on the
ground that a menagerie was not a
fitting place for a young lady.
The court, however, thought other
wise, and the young lady will stay with.
her mother and her feline pets.the "V7ea|:he&.6 l^

LONDON, Feb. 20.â Jh dispatch from Tokio, dated to*day, says: "Cannonading was heard this morning of^M peninsula. Three uniden>
tified warships appeared vff Oqujiri and iQutogori to-day, apparently searching for the; cable. The steamship TamdkawaMaru, which has arrived at Shimonoseki, reports she
was followed, seven miles off Fusan, by four warships, and that the chase was 'abandoned near ' Tsushima.' * This - would indicate that the Vladivostok , squadron was trying to
join the Russian ships at Port Arthur. Where the merchantman was chased is near 'the end of Korea, where Japan was supposed to have complete control of the sea.

SAN BERNARDINO, Feb. L'0.â Fire
broke out in the County Hospital this
afternoon, spread quickly through the
ward3 on the upper floor and endan
gered the lives of a number of pa
tients. The nurses succeeded in remov
ing all the Inmates and endeavored to
control the flames with the fire appa
ratus in the building, but could
make no headway against it until the
department arrived from the city. The
water pressure was so light that the
firemen could not save the upper por

nas destroyed and the roof fell in. The
lower floors suffered only from water.
The patients were scattered about
the grounds at nightfall, but tents were
secured and mads habitable as rapidly
as possible. There were, about eighty
patients in the hospital. The damage
does not exceed $6000, but it will re
quire a number of weeks to repair it.

"God Is With Us," Writes Kaiser in
Message of Sympathy to
Czar Nicholas.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. . CO'â The
Czar, according to those /who' have ac
cess to his presence, feels keenly th<;
outbreak of hostilities' and sorrows at
the expense the war' entails. . Since the
news of the bombardment of Port Ar
thur he has been occupied with confer
ences, and has appeared In public only
on one or two occasions to review the
departing troops or to show himself at
a window of the Winter Palace to ac
cept patriotic demonstrations.
Persons who have seen the Czar say
he is looking sad and careworn, and
that his well-known kindness of heart
causes him to feel acutely the loss of
his brave men. His sole recreation now
consists of a morning saunter in the
garden adjoining .the palace. The
ground is covered with snow, but still
he walks about, invariably accompa
nied by five dogs, which are trained to
march In single file. behind him. ,'The
Czar selected one of the. dogs to head
the procession.
When the Czar addressed some troops
a few days ago and admonished them
in these words, "Remember, your (en
emy is brave, bold and cunning/' he
could not disguise his emotion and his
voice shook very much. He # is .grieved
over what he considers to be the
treacherous conduct of the Japanese.
SYMPATHIZERS OF CZAR. -
It is known that the Czar has re
ceived at least three, personal letters
from European sovereigns expressing
their sympathy. They are Emperor
William. King Chris.tian . of Denmark
and King Oscar of Sweden and Nor
way. ' â¢ *
The letter from Emperor. William
was brought by the commander of the
Alexandria III Regiment of Prussian
Grenadiers, of which the * Czar. is. ,
honorary colonel, and concluded .'with
the significant words:' "God'is with us."
The epistle from. the Czar's august
grandfather. King Christian^ is said' to
be more than an ordinary.^exchange
between close relatives, and the . mis
sive from King Oscar is of the.friend
liest character and contains the warm
est assurances for Russia in' her '.hour
of trial and for the Czar personally.
MOVEMENT OF TROOPS.
Miiitary activity is proceeding on !

sian army, should that become'.neces

have a distinctly Cossack appearance.
SOLDIERS WELL "TREATED!;
Stories of privation suffered by the
soldiers on the military trains going
to the East, are grossly exaggerated.

The' Viedomosti publishes an edi
torial article on the pride shown in
Great; Britain and the United States'
in their. pro T Japanese sympathies and
asks what, these will ultimately cost
the cultured west. Answering this
question, the, paper, says: â -.:'

PARIS, Feb.. 20.â It is learned that
the Russian . Foreign^ MInis.ter. . Cpurit
Lamsdorff,'. to-day- received from' the
â¢Washington. Government a communi
cation annbuncing that Russia's reply
was . Considered Â£ responsive to the

China' and Japan." Thi3 favorable re
sponse of Russia to the United States
is highly, gratifying to the ' officials
here, as it counteracts the mischievous
reports to the effect that the Russian
answer was' equivalent to. a rejection.
As a matter of fact 'Russia's reply, i3
practically the" same as those of the
other powers.-recognizing- the neutral
ity of China. with .-the, .exception of
Manchuria.:- The terms of the Russian
reply, are substantially as follows:
Russia wiR be glad to join with the
otherr powers in ithe ,recosrnition of
Chinese neutrality on three conditions:
) First, . that - China shall maintain
neutrality.' ' ;'~ 'â ''. . : *
Second." that â¢- Japan - shall loyally

SALONICA, Feb. 20.â Another battle
occurred between the insurgent Alban

ish troops on February IS. The Alban
ians were beaten, losing aOO men killed
or wounded. The Turks also lost heav
ily.

ment of the Albanians.
A battalion of troops from Sorovitch
and another from Monastir have left
Salonica.
PARIS, Feb. 20.â Almost with as
close attention as they are giving the
Russo-Japanese war, the French au
thorities are watching events in the
Balkans. From Bulgaria assurances
have been received that doea not
purpose to take any measures to pre
cipitate war, and most of the leaders of
the recent insurrection have indicated
their purpose to see what the reforms
will accomplish before renewing the
rebellion in Macedonia. Moreover, it
is not believed here that the Macedon
ian committee has as much money as
heretofore with which to carry on a
conflict.
Nevertheless it is well understood
that Russia's preoccupation in the Far
East greatly increases the chance for
war in the Balkans. Turkey declares
she proposes to scrupulously carry out
the reforms imposed by the* powers,
but a high Turkish official here to-day
said the attitude of his Government
must necessarily depend on the attitude
of the Macedonians and Bulgarians.
Diplomats here say that- if ever an
opportunity existed for the porte once
for all to end the Macedonian trouble
by striking Bulgaria, which encourages
it, it is now. Despite the firm repre
sentations of Russia she undoubtedly is
willing to engage in a war in Europe
while engaged with Japan in the Far
East, and Turkey is expected to adopt
a firmer tone in dealing with the Mace
donian question.* The powers, it is an
nounced authoritatively, are still work
ing harmoniously together and they are
all making representations to Turkey
and Bulsaria on the folly of coins to
war. Certainly neither will profit
thereby.
NEW YORK, Feb. 20.â A. G. Hale,
a correspondent of the London Daily
News, who reached this port to-day on
the Cedric, has just returned from the
Balkans. Hale says the Bulgarians
have 300,000 of the finest trained
troops in the world and they are only
waiting until Russia gets her soldiers
away from the frontier when they will
pour into Turkey and attempt to lib
erate Macedonia.
â¢ E. A. Magnifice, United States Con
sul at Smyrna, arrived here to-day on
the Campania. The political situation
in the Balkans will be interesting next
summer, he said
"Now that Russia is engaged. Tur
key will take steps to keep Bulgaria
from taking Macedonia." he con
tinued. "Just before I left a brigand
named Tsakiga had been making
trouble. Summoned by the authorities
to give himself up he refused and
killed thirty-five Albanians. who were
sent to take him."

Special Dispatch* to The Call.
HERMOSILLO, Mexico, Feb. 20.â
Alarming ; reports from many sections
of the districts of Ures and Guaymas
indicate that the Yaqui Indians are
taking to the warpath and that a gen
eral uprising. is probable.
The military, authorities have just
been advised of an assault by;a roving
band of savages in the vicinity of Con
centracion. on the Yaqui River. San

ican driver were all mercilessly' shot
down by the Yaquis, who later at
tacked the neighboring .towns, of .La
Dura, Sagui Grand and El Realto, but
were repulsed' by.-; citizens^ while i the
women andchildren fled to Concentra
cion for safety.
Troops have been dispatched to the
scene of the trouble, but the place is a
hundred miles from the railroad and
the Indians may commit new,depre
dations before the band can be
broken up. -
Near Represo,- on San Carlos Bay,
Ca^tain^J. M. .Maytorena and a force
of volunteer, trbbps engaged a band of
Indians and met with defeat, losing

WORK IN SIGHT

Nation's Chief May Xot Have
an Opportunity to Enjoy
a Vacation Until Autumn
CONVENTION THE REASON
Desire to' Keep in Touch
With the Party Leaders Is
Likely toT)isturb Some. Plans
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20.â It.seems
probable that President Roosevelt will
be In Washington during the. heat of
the'Presidential campaign this year in
stead of Oyster Bay, where it has been
supposed he would remain for several
months'.. -The President ha3 made ten
tative arrangements for the summer
and autumn and they include a com
paratively brief sojourn at Oyster Bay.
It is quite certain that the President
himself will not go to Oyster Bay this
year until after the convention. A
few days, perhaps, after the conven
tion, he will go to. his summer home.
He will remain there, according to
present arrangements, for a week or
ten days. It is possible, however, that
he may prolong his sojourn at his
summer home until the middle of Sep
tember, but not longer that that. He
then will return to .Washington and
remain here during the campaign.
Many reasons have induced the Presi
dent not to pass the entire summer and
autumn in Oyster Bay! 'Chief among
them is the necessity that he should
be in close touch with the leaders of
the Republican party. This will be
scarcely possible if he should remain
at Oyster Bay during the campaign.
Facilities of all | kinds in the pretty
Long "Island town, in which is located
the President's summer home, are
limited. Crowds of even moderate pro
portions cannot be accommodated
there, and it Is inconvenient for visit
ors to reach the President even after
they arrive in the village, the Presi
dent's home. Sagamore Hill, being three
miles from the station.
President Roosevelt will go to Oyster
Bay early in November, in order to be
there on- election day. It is quite likely
that he will receive the returns from
the elections there, but this has not yet
been determined definitely. Some time
in the summer or autumn the President
will visit the Louisiana Exposition,
but no time has been. fixed yet for that
visit. 'â¢ :
HIGHER WAGES
ARE GRANTED
Two Unions of the Boilermakers
Are Given the
Increase by Their Employers
Two unions of the boilermakers have
obtained an increase of their wages
from $3 15 to $3 60 a day. The majority
of. the men belonging to these unions
are employed at. the Fulton Iron Works.
The raise in wages benefits more than
400 men and boys according to their
several grades.
The men that struck for-hlgher wages
at the Union Iron Worlds also succeed
ed in obtaining a raise in their daily
pay, and as a consequence the strike
was of short duration. The necessity of
the Government vessels on
Vime at these works prompted the man
agement to grant the demand of the
men.
Encouraging reports are being re
ceived daily. at headquarters from the
various labor unions for the formation
of a central labor body in this city.
Labor union bodies, like all other or
ganizations, do not at. all times run
smoothly, and to overcome this friction
it is proposed to start a central body,
taking into its fold the rank and file of
the workingmen. the claim being made
that there is a necessity for such an
organization. â¢
There is a difference of opinion exist
ing between bodies of painters over. the
half -holiday scheme on Saturdays. One
wing claims that the time is ; extended

J^air Young; Principal in Recent
Scandal on Sound Is Deter
mined to Become' an Actress
Spurninp: the* entreaties of her loving
sister. Miss Clip Allen. - who recently
fled from Seattle/and has been a guest
at the Grand Hotel for several days,
has refused to abandon her plans for
a theatrical career arid stubbornly an
nounces her intention of remaining in
San Francisco. Yesterday's train from
the north brought to this city Miss
Gertrude Allen, an. elder sister of the
fair maiden whose professed love for
one of Seattle's prominent married
business men has started the city on
the sound gossiping merrily. Arriving
here the sister hastened to the Grand
Hotel/ where she was ushered into the
presence of Clio. In the latter's room
the two women entered into a council
that lasted several hours, but failed to
effect the purpose of Miss Gerturde'a
visit here. Clio was appealed to to re
turn to the north, but appeals were of
no avail and finally the elder and wiser
sister abandoned hope of taking Clio
back to Seattle."
WILL BE WITH FRfEXDS.
Later in the day the tw6 wbracn
visited several friends and*hhally an
nounced that Clio would change her
residence to-day from the hotel to the
home of a family acquaintance. Miss
Gertrude Allen is apparently deter
mined that her younger sister shall be
discouraged In her mad infatuation for
Frank H. Kilbourne of Seattle, who
has declared his intention to get a di
vorce and marry her. It is -with this
determined purpose In view that the
elder sister has planned to have Clio
sheltered under the roof of friends of
the family, where their influences may
finally cause her to forget the man with
whom, her name has been so disagree
ably connected and return to her
mother's home in Seattle. .
When Clio left her home, a week ago
Friday, and sought the assistance of
Kilbourne, it was Gertrude who traced
her to a hotel in North Seattle and en
treated the young woman to return.
Kilbourne was present at the time and.
so it is claimed, there was a stormy
scene between him and Gertrude, which
ended In her returning to her Tamily
and telling her relatives of her futile
efforts to persuade Clio to leave Kil
bourne.
CLIO JUST OF AGE. "
Plans to have Kilbourne arrested
came to naught, for the reason that
Clio had just reached her majority and
was in, reality privileged to do as she
pleased^ put 'notwithstanding this fact,
Gertrude decided to keep after her
sister, and when she finally learned of
her departure from Seattle sha. decided
to follow her and did so as soon as she
learned that Clio was in San Francisco.
She arrived here yesterday, full of
hope of inducing Clio to return to the
north, and her disappointment was in
tense when she realized that her sister's
will could not be overcome. It was
then that Gertrude conceived the idea
of placing Clio where Kilbourne could
not visit her. and in this she was suc
cessful, a fact which she telegraphed
to her moth'er last evening. Clio" also
wrote to several of her Seattle friends
that she would not return to her home.

Cor. Geary St.RUMORS OF A WORLD-WAR
EXCITE THE PARIS BOURSE
EPITOME OF THE' DAY'S WAR NEWS.
Russian have penetrated nearly a hundred miles, into Northern Korea without developing the enemy; yet it is prob
able that a few miles farther on Japanese troops might be found in force preparing for an advance. . â¢
Rigid censorship always indicates important movements. The almost absolute cessation of dispatches from Japan and
Korea is must significant. The large expeditions which left Japan's seaports during last week have certainly by this time reached
their objective point. If they had been destined for Liaotung Peninsula it is reasonable to suppose that information of landings
or repulses would have reached Chefu. It is probable, therefore, that Korea wa&.the .real obketive point, aiid that these troops have
landed at either Chemulpo or Wonson. By this time there must be 50,000 of Japan|s best rroops massed north of Seoul, and news
of a general advance may be expected soon. - â -â¢â '.
Reports from Port Arthur indicate that the Russian generals and soldiers are alert, and that no repetition of the supine
ness which gave Japan command of the sea can be looked for.
War rumors involving nearly every nation in Europe upset the Paris bourse, and panicky conditions prevailed all day;
The friction over the United States consulate in Dalny, Manchuria, loomed large among these trouble-making rumors. A reassur
ing statement is sent out by the English Foreign Office.
Wheat again made a wild advance on war news and rumors. \
It is believed the Vladivostok squadron is attempting to' reach Port Arthur to reinforce the Russian â¢ fleet in that harbor.
Panic Caused by Report of Prospective Mobilization
of French and German Armies* II
PAKIS. Feb. 20.â Wild excitment pre
vailed on the bourse to-day as the
result of startling contradictory re
ports concerning possible world com
plications srowinz out of the war.
These rumors included the prospective
mobilization of the German and French
armies. The evening papers also saio.
that serious influences were exerted by
the report of diifleulties between the
United States and Russia in conse
quence of the refusal of Russia to
Krant an exequatur to Morgan as
United States Consul at Dalny. Finan
ciers asserted the market was in such
a sensitive condition that the wildest
rumors were taken up and might lead
to serious complications.
Financial authorities say that not
since 18S2 has a scene occurred on the
bourse like that of to-day. Alraost
from the opening the leading securities
bcean to fall. French rentes were par
ticularly nflected. Russian imperials
also dropped, as did also other foreign
bonds. Dnrfas the early hours heavy
depreciation occurred" on all sides,
leading up to brutal sacrifices of val
Â»ics.
Spanish rentes were specially affect
ed by the great confusion which pre
\ ailed over the fears of international
cnrnpltcatlona.
EXCITEMENT IS REDOUBLED.
This condition was aggravated during
the closing huiir, and the excitement,
which amounted to a. panic, was re
doubled. French, Spanish and Turkish
lentes were offered arv.id a great up
io;Â»r. At the close the market was
very apitafed. Russian imperial 4 per

. CAN' HAVE DYSPEPSIA
And Still Be Ajrrceable. Attractive and
Popular*â A Certain Cure In
Reach of All.
There is nothing that will put you to
the front so rapidly in the business or
so.cial world as a cheerful disposition
and a pleasant appearance. Other
things being equal, people will go out
of their way to give the fellow a lift
who always wears a cheerful counten-
ance. The man or woman with a
cranky disposition and a sour face will
always meet with an Indifferent if not
a chilly reception. The commercial
traveler, who is the recognized busi-
ness - barometer, appreciates better
than any one the value of this rule
and governs his actions accordingly.
Dyspepsia destroys all the agreeable
qualities that enter into a man's or
woman's jnake-up. It is almost a hu-
man impossibility for any one with a
severe case of dyspepsia to look pleas-
ant. The continuous, miserable, cast-
down .feeling is bound to make itself
shown in the appearance and conver-
sation.
Stuarfs Dyspepsia Tablets are the
sufferer's certain cure. They are so
recognized all over the world. The
cures they have brought about and
the happiness they have caused and
the suffering they have relieved has
made their name a household word in
all the English-speaking world.
The reason that Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets are a certain cure is tha.t they
are a natural cure. There is nothing
to prevent them curing. They con-
tain the essential ingredients of the di-
gestive fluids of- the stomach and
pimply do the identical work of the
stomach. relieving that weakened
orga.n and permitting it to rest and
recuperate. Could anything be more
simple ur natural? They are bound
to cure. They cannot help themselves.
It is just like putting a new stomach
into ;i manâ if that were possible â
and letting the old one go off on a
vacation. Ilest is what it needs. Na-
ture will do her own work of restora-
tion, never fear.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
Bale by all druggists at 50 cents a box.
All druggists means all druggists.
They have become so necessary to the
people that the, druggist simply has to
keep them anyway. There are other
remedies that he can make much more
money on ff he could sell them, but
he can't. He will not take chances on
losing Ws customers by not always

seemed general yesterday afternoon
that the market would drop, and, so
far as possible, thevbrokers were pre
pared to meet the situation. From
I^yons came an unconfirmed report of
a failure of a small broker.
FINANCIERS WILL ACT.
It is reported that several promi
nent financiers will assemble to-mor
row for the purpose of preventing a
continuance of the panic on Monday.
Their efforts will be assisted by the
authorities, who are publicly denying
the alarming rumors.
The Foreign Office denied the re
port circulated on the Bourse to-day
of the mobilization of the French army
and no information has been received
that such a step has, been taken by
Germany. All that has been done has
been to take measures of a precaution
ary character, not because of
any fear of immediate trouble,
but in order to be prepared for possi
ble eventualities. The Foreign Office
officials also declared that the Bourse
pan.'c was utterly without reason.
The Foreign Office here declared to
be absurd the report circulated yes
terday, in New York, alleged to be
from Paris, to the effect that 60.000
Japanese troops had been concentraj
ted at the island of Formosa, with the
intention of invading the French pos
sessions in the Far East in case of
France siding with Russia against
Japan."
The Foreign Office to-day denied
the reoort that President Loubet in
tended to visit the â  Czar and added
that such a visit had not been consid
ered.
BRITONS ARE TRANQUIL.
LONDON, Feb. 20. â Count Benck
endorff, the Russian Embassador. left
London to-day for St. Petersburg. The
afternoon papers made a sensation
out of his departure, connecting it
with rumors that the Czar was dis
ptesjted with his Embassjylors in
Washington and London and with his
late Minister in Tokio. owing to the
recent turn of events and out of base
less rumors of threatening Evropean
trouble. â¢
The Russian embassy said positively
that Count Benckendorff had gof% to
St. Petersburg for three days to bid
farewell to his son, who is going to
the Far East with his regiment. The
embassy added that the Embassador's
journey was in nS way connected with
his position as Embassador. The
Foreign Office here confirms this.
The uneasiness exhibited on the Con
tinent in regard to the possibility that
a European war may ensue from the
struggle in the Far East is not shared
by Great Britain. No power has made
such complete naval preparation for
every contingency, and yet nowhere is
confidence greater that the hostilities
will be confined to Russia and Japan
than it is in London. The naval and
military preparations announced from
continental capitals are regarded here
as being mere common-sense measures,
which any power must adopt. Â«
YELLOW PRESS IS ACTIVE.
It also is believed that the lull in. the
actual war news has led many Euro
pean correspondents to employ their
spare time in exaggerating the conti
nental action and in applying, such
steps as have been actually taken to er
roneous motives. The latest of these,
lhat Great Britain intends to seize
Spanish ports in the event of war, has
not even the semblance of probability.
At the present moment Spain and
Great Britain are on the verge of con
cluding an . arbitration treaty, and in
'other ways their diplomatic relations
are closer than they have been in years
past.
At the Spanish embassy â  here it was
emphatically declared that the move
ments of Spanish troops were simply
precautionary. At the Foreign- Office
and at the Spanish embassy the belief
is entertained that no other European
power will be involved, least of all
Spain, which has no direct or indirect
interest at stake.
"All the rumors," the Foreign Office
"said, "that European complications are
in sight are quite baseless."

WASHINGTON, Feb. 20.âConfirma
tion is obtained at the Russian embas-
Ey of the dispatch from London that
the Russian Embassador is going to St.
Petersburg to see his son. All the re
ports attaching further significant* to

acterized as ridiculous. It is "pointed

STEAMSHIP BRINGS
JAPANESE EXHIBIT
FOR ST. LOUIS FAIR
VICTORIA,. B. C. Feb., 20.â The
steamship Lyra of the- Boston Steam
ship Company arrived this morning
from Yokohama after the roughest
passage ever made by her across the
Pacific. She battled ; with fierce hur
ricanes all the way. The Lyra brings
the most valuable cargo ever shipped
from Japan to America, consisting of
articles for the Japanese exhibit at the
St. Louis Exposition, including con
tributions from the Mikado's own pri
vate collection.
The Lyra left just before the'out
break of the war, but the feeling then
was intense. Immense crowds be
sieged the naval and military, offices
demanding enrollment.
A grand parade of imperial cavalry
took place on the military^ grounds at
Toklo just before the steamship left
and was witnessed by hundreds of
thousands of people wild with enthu
siasm. For many weeks previous to
the sailing of the Lyra the Japanese
naval vessels had been at target prac
tice.

succeeded in passing the lines under
official escort and visited Port Arthur,
which is closed to all civilians. The
correspondent gives the following ac
count of conditions: Â»
"Only 30 per cent of the populaton
remains at Port Arthur and many of
these are leaving. The trains are stUl
crowded with refugees. Railroad con
ditions are excellent and trains are
running on schedule time. There are
only a few unfinished sidetracks and
one unfinished bridge between New
chwang- and - Port Arthur. The penin
sula of Liaotung is quiet. Adequate
guards are maintained at all culverts
and- bridges and preparations for de
fense are being continued. The troops
in the vicinity of Kinchow are active.
A strong force is guarding the narrow
est-section of the peninsula.
"The authorities have mitigated war
conditions at Port Arthur by fixing the
prices of foodstuffs. The prices of
other, commodities, however, have ad
vanced. The authorities have taken
possession of alL food supplies in the
stores which were deserted by Chinese
and other merchants. They are pro
viding.for a siege by sending wheat
milling machinery to. Port Arthur and
claim that there is a sufficient food
supply there for a resistance of 'two
years.
"Japanese refugees, under the per
sonal supervision of the Viceroy and
General Plancon, are leaving Port
Arthur on released ships. The local
agents of two British steamships
which were deserted during the Jap
anese attack are endeavoring to induce
the captains of these vessels to return
and reclaim them. The Brand, . the
only ship now remaining at Port
Arthur, will leave there on February 21
with refugees and dispatches.
"Although- the harbors on the. Liao
tung Peninsula have been reopened, the
authorities do not expect further ar
rivals.- The Japanese fleet, which is
sighted at intervals from Gold Hill,
completely controls the gulf and, under
the imperfect police system, air In
comers are treated as spies:
"The repairs to the RussUn fleet are
proceeding. The cruiser Novik has
been docked, but the condition of the
battleships Cesarevitch and. Retvizan
remains unchanged. Engineers say that
the Retvizan will be floated in a few
days. ?v

CENTRAL FIGURE IN ORIENT
IS ADMIRAL TOGO OF JAPAN
Hero of Port Arthur Battle Is Gallant Naval Officer
Who Fired the First Shot in the
Chino-Japanese War. '"..*. â â v.
The following article by Robert Mach
ray. published in the London Daily Mail
of February 2 under the caption "The
Nelson of Japanâ Admiral Togo," is of
especial interest just at this time. Its
description of the admiral's connection
with the Chino- Japanese war, the first
phot in which he fired, amounts to a
forecast of Togo's action at the out
break of the Ruebo - Japanese war.
when he be^an hostilities by an attack
on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur:
'â¢More perhaps is heard and known
in this country of the army of Japan
;han of her sieter service, but without
her navy she would not and could not
be the center of the world's interest as
ehe is to-day.
"Admiral Togo, the man in chief
command at sea of her splendid fleet,
is likely to be one of the foremost fig
ures of our time, for on him will de
volve in all probability as prodigious a
responsibility as fell to the lot of Nel
eon in our own national history-
"It is his destiny to wield one of the
finest, one of the most formidable in-
Ftruments ever forged. In her navy Ja
l>an has created in less than ten years
as perfect and as tremendous a fighting
machine as any on the globe. At this
perilous crisis in her fortunes she has
chosen to place the working of J^vis ma
chine in the hands of Admiral Togoâ a
choice, we may be sure, that has been
made with the utmost deliberation and
after a complete survey of all the possi
bilities of the situation. Japan feels
this is a matter in which there must be
no mistake, and the unanimous ap
proval of the nation expressed on his
appointment to the chief command
shows that he is regarded as the right
man in the right place.
TOGO A SIMPLE GENTLEMAN.
â¢Admiral Togo is nov.- about 55
\e:irs of age. He is not of princely or
noble birth, but is a simple gentleman,
a Samurai of the great Satsuma clan,
a.s so many of his fellow-officers are.
His senior In rank. Admiral Count Ito
<not to be confused with his namesake
Mitrquis Ito), >vho was in chief com
mand of the navy during the Chino-
Jypanese war, and is now chief of the
naval headquarters staff in Tokio, is
also a Sa.tsuma Samurai, and formerly
the whole Japanese fleet was officered
and manned by the Satsuma. in the
Bame way that the Japanese army was
dr;nvn from the Choshu clan. Now
adays neither navy nor army is en
tirely given over to these, the two
most Dowerfnl of the clans of Japan,
but many men from all over the em
pire are found in both services. When
Togb entered the navy, however, its
uhol? personnel was Satsuma.
"Admiral Togo received a great
part of his education at the Naval Col
lege. Greenwich. where he went
through the regular courses of instruc
tion current some thirty odd years
;iSTÂ». He thus understands a good deal
<>f the histox-y. training and tradition?
of th<* British navy, and he has
'wrought the knowledge thus acquired
to bear on his own with excellent ef
fect. Returning to Japan, he was
employed In various capacities. In
1??4. orben war broke out between
China and Japan, he was In command
of the Naniwa, a cruiser of 3650 tons,
one of the vessels composing what
was then known as the* first flying
Fouadron of the Japanese navy. Dur
ine the war he greatly distinguished
himself and earned the reputation of
Lrinn B fir^t-elass fighting man. '
SINKING OF THE KOWSH1XG.
"It ".-as in connection with the epi-
Fodc of the sinking of the Kowshing
that h!s n?me first came into world
wide iirorrsinence. At the time some
adverse criticisms of his action on that
occasion were heard, but these died
away on a fuller knowledge of the clr
cumftarco?. The story reveals some
thing of the character of the man. so
it is worth telling again.

were about to fight over Korea. War
ships had been assembled and large
bodies of. troops were either on the
field or were on the way to the scene
of conflict. The Kowshing, a transport
vessel, flying the British flag, with a
British w captain and crew and carry
ing some 1100 Chinese soldiers for
Asan, was met bv Togo in the Naniwa,
who signaled to her by firing two
blank cartridges to stop, which she
did. Thereafter a Japanese lieutenant
went on board the Kowshing with a
peremptory order from Togo that the
transport must proceed no farther to
ward her destination, but at once ac
'company the Naniwa to the main Jap
anese fleet. Captain Galsworthy of
the Kowshing was willing to obey
these orders, but not so minded were
the officers of the Cheese forces on
the vessel. They immediately raised
a great clamor and threatened Gals
worthj'.
FIRST SHOT OF THE WAR.
"Seeing what was occurring, Togo
sent a boat to bring off Captain Gals
worthy and his crew; but, meanwhile,
the disturbance and confusion on the
Kowshing had increased and the Chi
nese prevented them leaving her.
Some time then passed and at length
Togo signaled Galsworthy to take one
of his own boats and come to the
Naniwa; but the British captain was
not allowed -by the Chinese to do so.
For four hours Togo stood off sKd on
trying to save him and the ship, but
finding there was no chance of this he
at last ordered the red flag, which an
nounced that he was about to fire, to
be hoisted. A few moments later a
well directed shot from the Naniwa
s&uck the engine-room and pene
trated the hull of the Kowshing.
which soon afterward filled and sank.
As GsÂ»"=worthy and his men leaped
over the. bulwarks of the transport
into the sea they were fired on by the
Chinese. Togo at once sent out boats
and rescued as many as he could.
"In this way Togc began the Chino-
Japanese war. His countrymen have
never forgotten the part he played in
this episode. 'Togo!' they say, "It was
Togo who sank the Kowshing." And
they draw a confident augury from
it.
"In the course of the war Togo saw
a great deal of actual fighting, so he

Tangchow and saw the final overthrow
and destruction at Weihaiwei of all

scatheless through these ordeal3.
though she received no vital damage.
But ever the fame of Togo Heihachiro^
grew; he was known as a man of reso-*
lution and resource, most of all as a
hard and determined fighter. .
TOGO'S POSITION TO-DAY.
"After the war he was raised to the
rank of rear admiral and promoted to
the third command in the Japanese
fleet. Prior to his present appoint
ment he was commander in chief at
Maizuru, a dockyard on the Sea of
Japan. Maizuru Is not one of the
largest yards in the island empire, but
it may become of great importance as
a suitable port from which troops can
be dispatched to Korea, owing to its
comparative nearness to that penin
sula. His present rank is that of vice
admiral.
â¢ "All information with respect to the
Japanese fleet has been so absolutely
withheld for the past few weeks by
the censor that it is not quite certain
on :which ship Admiral Togo has
hoisted his flag; but it is understood
that the Hatsuse is the vessel. The
Hatsuse is a sister ship to the Mikasa;
that is to say, she is on*e of the largest
and most powerful battleships afloat,
having over 15,000 tons displacement.
"In person Admiral Togo is a short,
somewhat stout man, with full black
beard and mustache, and a distinctive
ly Japanese appearance. He is not a
great talker; indeed, in manner he is

knows what it Can do. to; a" ; nicety;- He
knows the spirit and temper of his
men, freshly and, passionately moved'
at this time by a consuming fever of

SPAIN'S PREPARATIONS
INDICATE THE FEAR
OF EUROPEAN WAR
MADRID, Feb. 20.â Two regiments qf
infantry at Jsan Sebastian and. two reg
iments at Pampeluna are hel&ln readi
ness to start for the J3alearic ; Islands.
War Minister Linares 'has sent 1 a circu
lar to the military authorities ordering
the recall of all soldiers â¢ on furlough
andj to retain with the colors men whose
service terminates on March 1.-.
These measures caused .considerable
excitement, which was not" diminished
by the rumors which continued to cir
culate, in spite of ofncial r denlals,-th4t
this military activity; was due \to -a
warning from a European'power to the
effect that in the event of a Continental
war Great Britain "intende'd to seize
ports on the Spanish coast,' 1 ' â¢-â â 'â ; v

already been assigned to co-operate
with the navy in the defense of -the is
lands and the coast of the mainland of
Spain. A prominent official said:
"The mobilization is probabljj due to
a scare similar to that which Spain ex
perienced when she expected Rear Ad
miral Watson's fleet to attack her
coast."
However, the authorities here are
aware that Spain is suspicious that the
.present war may lead some powers to
attempt to secure strategic positions
near Gibraltar. British -and French ne
gotiationsconcernlng Northern Moroc

PARIS HEARS OF WAR
EXCURSIONS PLANNED
IN SAN FRANCISCO
PARIS. Feb. 20.â "Chlldrien, would
you rather see the war for your Easter
vacation or visit the St. Louis Expo
sition?" the Matin quotes an American
paterfamilias as asking.
In that newspaper and the Figaro
are articles which assert that the walls
oC San Francisco are placarded with
posters of rival tourist ' concerns
which read like this: "War excur
sions. Trip to witness great modern
battle. Powerful searchlights . for
viewing night encounters. Safest
steamers; best handled on the Pacific
Ocean.' Passengers can see everything
without the slightest risk."
Children, of course, according to these
stories, choose to see the war, be
cause there is more chance of noise.
The writers conclude that the attend
ance on the â¢ exposition will suffer
through the rivalry of -the counter at
traction so handy to Americaâ "just
across the Pacific."
The inference Is drawn from a card
inclosed in an envelope, which reads:
"Before leaving insure your life in â
Insurance Company."
That holiday Jaunt to see a naval en
gagement may not be such a quiet
treat for a who-!e family after all. It
is. gravely asserted that the excursion
promoters â and the insurance compa
nies â are coining ".money.
"Business is business", is the head
ing on one such account of the practi
cal Yankee's eye for the main chance.
FRANCE EXPLAINS
STAY OF RUSSIAN
SHIPS AT JIBUTIL
PARIS, Feb. 20.â Exchanges of com
munications of a -friendly character
have occurred between France and" Ja
pan with respect to the stay of the
Russian squadron at Jibutil. France
did not hesitate to make a complete ex
planation of her' reasons^f or not order
ing the Russian ships to depart, and
it is said in a "reliable quarter that this
explanation was thoroughly satisfac
tory to the Japanese Government. The
frankness with which the French Gov
ernment dealt 'with the question was
gratifying to the Japanese diplomats,
and it is asserted that there' is no rea
son to believe that any friction will
arise between the two countries regard
ing the incident; -! â¢ 'â  â¢
It is now explained that France's
neutrality instructions, while (contrary
to a previous statement" made' on the
same subject) specifying the limit of
stay at twenty-four hours, differs from
the English neutrality laws, â¢; In that
this provision is hedged about, by va
rious conditions which enable exten
sions of the time during which a'bel
ligerent may remain in a French port.
France seeks, as she has told Japan
and the other powers,: to maintain an
attitude of loyal neutrality and has.no
intention of departing from this, policy.
. But so far as ordering the Russian
ships , to leave Jibutil this has not
been done, as to have done so -would
have aroused : the . French' people,
whose sympathy with ' Russia has be-:
come exceedingly, keen, and this Japan'
and certainly her ally do not 'desire. ,Â»"

cruiser tried to make repairs in the

deavored to have the cruiser compelled

RUSSIAN ATTITUDE
IN RELATION TO THE
DALNY CONSULATE
PARIS, Feb. 20. â The Temps, semi
official, quotes a high Russian author
ity as follows: */ ..
"Although the United States wished
to send a Consul to Dalny, it. is cer
tain that the Russian Government
alone can judge whether it Is desirable
to issue an- exequatur to that effect.
It is necessary to remember that while
Manchuria belongs to China, Russia
holds Port Arthur and Dalny under a
lease \ from the Chinese Government.
The war was commenced by 'Japan;
which practically has established a
state of siege at those points, what
is more natural than that the laws of
war should be extended to those points,
and that the authorities should refuse
to grant an exequatur to a foreign
Consul?
"If it pleases the United States to
ask China to issue exequaturs for
Consuls at Mukden and Antung it is
their right to do so. But the actual
situation confers upon us certain
rights. Manchuria, being the theater
of war occupied by us and recognized
by the United States and other pow
ers as outside of the Chinese zone of
neutrality, it is for our military au
thorities to judge the question of.re
ceiving these Consuls, even if China
grants them exequaturs. I do not
know the decision of Viceroy Alexieff,
but they (the military authorities) are
free to take .any action they wish."

BAIKAL. DISASTER SLIGHT.
With reference to the stories of a
disaster to the Russian troops at Lake
Baikal (one report saying that three
regiments were drowned ' while at
tempting to cross the ice-covered
Jake) It is explained that the trans-
Baikal line was blocked at the Baikal
station during the night of February
IS by an avalanche of snow, which
Jell from a neighboring mountain. A
train having troops on board dashed
into . the obstruction, the locomotive
v.-as derailed and In the succeeding
five cars one soldier was killed, five
were severely injured and fourteen
slightly hurt. Traffic was expected to
be resumed the following day.
Further advices from Port Arthur
â¢to-day say that all the women and
children and most of the male civil
ians have left that place and that
â  practically only the garrison remains.
The wave of patriotism sweeping
over the empire seems to be swamping
racial feeling, even the wild tribes of
the Caucasus, the discontented Finns
&nd the sullen Poles forgetting their
grievances and coming forward to vol
unteer their services to the common
latherlanll.
t An instance of devotion among the
Czar's Hebrew subjects Is afforded by
the act of forty-rive Jewish doctors in
giving up their practice to go to the
front. Before leaving they attended
a service held in a synagogue here.
Rabbi Drabakin made a fervent ad
dress to a large congregation, which
included Baron Ginzberg and other
Jewish notables. He said:
"Our fatherland is passing through
a difficult epoch. The moment has
come when you. my brothers, must
ihow the whole world that you are not
unworthy sons of your country and
that, although standing apart before
the altar of religion, you are united
with other citizens before the altar of
patriotism and are ready with all the
Czar's faithful lieges to sacrifice your
selves for the fatherland. Remember
that Russia is strong, not only in
arms, but in God's blessing."
After the service the congregation
sang the national hymn.
ACTIVITY OF THE CZARINA.
* The Czarina, who continues to take
great personal interest in the work of
providing for the sick and wounded of

meeting of the Ladies' Patriotic Soci

During a discussion in regard to

of Russia for the relief of the wounded
the Czarina proposed temporarily to
suspend the studies in the girls'
schools in order that the girls might
be able to devote the school hours to
sewing. The suggestion was ap

taken. Her Majesty, who is an ex

be built where the Japanese got
theirs.

HOW THE WAR STARTED.
A Russian account of the. events
immediately preceding the rupture
with Japan was published in the Offi
cial Messenger to-day with "the object
of rectifying certain statements from
Japanese sources." In this account it
is stated that upon receipt of the late
Japanese proposals, on January 16, the
Government immediately proceeded to
examine the Japanese demands, and
on January 25 Kurino, the Japanese
Minister, was informed, in reply to his
inquiry, that the Czar had intrusted
the proposals to a special conference,
the members of which would meet on
January 28, and that his Majesty's de
cision probably would not be given be-

Louis Koenig of 1601 Turk
Street and Dominick Moran,
1526 Howard Street, Victims
Three men robbed six others in the
bar of the grocery store of Louis Koe
nig, at the corner of Pierce and Turk
streets, at 11:20 o'clock last night and
secured about $30 in cash, a gold
watch and two revolvers. The robbers
were In the saloon but five minutes
and did not get all of the money car
riefl by the frequenters of the place, be
ing Frightened away by a passing car
before they had completed their search.
Five men, Conrad Richter, a Jeweler
of 13 Willow avenue; Ameil Shammel,
Paul Biel, W. E. Stroepzel and a man
'known as Sam, with the proprietor,
Louis Koenig, were sitting in the bar
room, when the robbers entered. One
of the crooks came In by the Pierce
street side door and another by the
Turk-street front entrance, while the
third stood guard on the sidewalk, Just
outside of the place.
The robbers wore white handker
chiefs over their faces and went about
the work, of securing the valuables of
the inmates of the barroom in an ama
teurish fashion. Each of them leveling
a huge' revolver at the heads of the
crowd commanded them to throw up
their hands and face the wall. While
one went through the pockets of the
victims the other passed behind the bar
and opening the*register extracted from
it about $5 in coin, a gold watch and
chain valued at $75 belonging to, Ihe
proprietor and two loaded revolvers.
The robbers got little coin from^the
men lined against the wall. The search
they made of the pockets was done
hurriedly, the crooks being In a hurry
and apparently nervous through fear
of detection. A passing car clanged its
bell and the man on guard on the side
walk called to his companions to make
their exit. Backing hurriedly out of the
saloon, the thieves commanded the
crowd to keep silence, threatening to
come back and riddle the whole bunch
with lead if they attempted to make an
outcry.
Several hundred dollars was over
looked by the holdup men in - their
haste. They neglected to go through
the vest pockets of the victims/where
most of them carried their money.
Twelve dollars was taken from the
trousers of Koenig, Richter yielded up
$4 50, Shammel contributed $7, Biel's
clothes were relieved of all he had, $6.
Sam's pockets were turned inside out,
but failed to produce any of the "filthy
lucre."
The men who were held up say that
the robbers were about the age of 18.
They'dld not see the man on the'side
walk, but describe the two that did
the Job as being the proverbial tall and
short ones. Koenig claims that the rob
bers acted very nervous and constantly
listened for signs of any one approach
ing.
The police were' notified and arrived
on the scene about two hours after the
deed was committed. The robbers ran
down Turk street and were lost in the
darkness before any'of the unfortunate
contributors to the crooks* relief fund
could give the alarm.
Shortly, after. 10 o'clock last, evening, a
man wearing a black mask entered the

fore^February 2. On the last named
date Emperor Nicholas ordered the
preparation of a draft of definitive in
structions to Baron de Rosen, the Rus
sian Minister to Japan, based upon the
deliberations of this conference. On
February 3 identical telegrams were
sent to Viceroy Alexieff and Baron de
Rosen containing the text of the draft
of a proposed Russo-Japanese agree
ment, with a full statement of the rea
sons which prompted Russia to mod
ify the Japanese proposals, and general
Instructions to Baron de Rosen con
cerning the presentation of the reply
to the Japanese Government. . Forty
eight hours .before the receipt of the
news of the rupture Foreign Minister
L.amsdor2C notified Kurino of the dis
patch of the Russian reply. On Feb
ruary 5 Viceroy Alexieff notified the
Foreign Olnce of Baron de Rosen's re
ceipt of the reply. .
On February 6 at 4 p. m. Kurino
quite unexpectedly handed to Count
Lamsdorff two notes, notifying him of
the rupture of the negotiations of dip
lomatic relations and adding that he
(Kurino) "and his staff would leave St.
Petersburg on February 20. These
notes were accompanied by a public
letter from Kurino to Count Lams
dorff, expressing the hope that the
rupture of relations would be con
fined to the shortest possible time. On
the same day Viceroy Alexieff, Baron
de Rosen and all the Russian repre
sentatives in Peking, .Tokio and the
capitals of the great powers were in
formed by urgent telegrams of the
rupture of relations and of the issue of
an imperial order withdrawing the
Russian legation from Tokio and lay

all consequences ensuing. The com
munication
"Although the breaking off of dip
lomatic relations by no means implied
the opening of hostilities, the Japanese
Government, as early as the night of
February 8 and during February 9 and
10. committed a whole series of re
volting attacks on Russian warships
and merchantmen, attended by viola
tions of "international law. The de

JERSEY ISLAND PACKING
COMPANY AGAIN IX COURT
Filos an Action for Rent and Damages
Against Pacific Coast Dredging
and Reclamation Company.
Once more is the Jersey Island
Packing Company, a .corporation con
ducted by the wealthy Wright family
of San Jose, in litigation. Yesterday
it commenced an action against the
Pacific Coast Dredging and Reclama
tion Company for $200 rent for two
rcowf, 51395 expended in repairing
the scows after they had been reutrn
*Â»d by Ih* defendant and $1030 alleged
by the plaintiff to have been lost by it
through the idleness of the., scows
while feeing repaired.
It was only a few months ago that
the plaintiff corporation dismissed
more than forty suits it had instituted
acainst various corporations, one of
which was the companV sued yester
day. The multiplicity of actions was
caused by the fact that the Wright
family, which was interested in all
the corporations, both plaintiff and
defendant, had a quarrel over money
matters. Judging by the suit filed yes
terday the declaration of peace at
the time, of the dismissal was but a
temporary affair.

COOK ENFORCES ARGUMENT
WITH KNIFE AND CLEAVER
Kitchen of the ilcrchant.s' Club Is the
Scene of am Attempt to Com
mit Murder.
Peter Hourtane, chief cook at the
Merchants' Club, complained to the
police last evening that Romeo Mitch
til, v.ho fills the position of Â«econd in
command in the culinary department,
attempted to decapitate him with a
butcher knife and cleaver, and dis
played :i number of cuts on the neck
to substantiate his assertion. Accord
ing to the story told to Captain Mar
ti!!, Mitchell became enraged /by rea
son cf the statement made by his.su
perior that liquor had Incapacitated
him for work and attempted to re
fute what he considered a libel in. a
manner not conducive to good halth
or hanpiness.
The trouble occurred in the kitchen
of the Merchants' Club, an organiza
tion composed of "captains of indus
try," located in the Npw York Mutual
Life building, corner of Sansome and
California streets. Hourtane up
braided Mitchell for his apparent in
toxicated condition and the latter ar
gued the point with a butcher knife.
Hourtane was severely cut in the neck
and just as his assailant was about to
wield a murderous cleaver Bruce R<3
land, steward of the club, intervened
and hostilities ceased.
Dr. W. A. "Dougherty was sum
moned and dressed the wounds sus
tained by Hourtane. The police were
notified and Detective* Harry Rey

whereabouts of Mitchell and place
him under arrest.

JOHN GARBER IS NAMED
FOR PANAMA COMMISSION
President Selects Distinguished Member of San Francisco
Bir Association for Place on Canal Board and Asks
.Senatoi Perkins to Urge Him to Accept Appointment
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, D.. C. Feb. 20.â If
Judge John Garber. the well-known
Sun Francisco lawyer, wishes to serve
on the Canal Commission he may do
so. President Roosevelt has signified
a desire that he shall so serve. The
President, to-day sent for both Cali
fornia Senators and told them he had
selected Judge Garber to represent the
Pacific Coast and asked Senator Per
kins to wire Garber and urge him to
accept. Both Senators* were taker,
somewhat by, surprise by the action of
the President, as Garber's name' had
not been suggested by either for the
honor, while the whole delegation was
united in presenting another name last
year, besides submitting, several other
names receiving the indorsement of
California business and scientific men.'
>io one Â£n the delegation seems dis
posed to criticise the selection, all
agreeing that if a lawyer is desired on
t.ho commission a good one has been
chosen in the person of Garber.
â¢That a lawyer should/- be .selected
seems -to bo the point of surprise, a3
the President is nuolcd as having re
peatedly said he would not appoint, a
man of that profession. He is said to
have first determined upon a medical
man, who would give his attention to
the sanitary nesds of the isthmus. It
was with this understanding that the
delegation last year united in present
ing the name of Dr. Chester Rowell of
Fresno,, regent of the California Uni
versity and State Senator. Dr. Rowell's
name was suggested and championed
especially by Senator Bard. Later
the President is said to have signified
a preference for an engineer hailing
from the Pacific Coast, and the names
of Messrs.* Manson and Schussler were
suggested by their friends, while the
faculty of the University of : Nevada
presented the name of Mr. Grunsky of
the San Francisco Board of Public
Works. The utility of a good business
man on the board being suggested, the
name of L. D. Craig was presented by
the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce.
F1SLTOX- FAVORS GAKBER.
Among the other candidates for the
honor were M. H. de Young. William
P.abcock. T. C. Raleigh of Humboldt
Cqunty and several others. It is said
that the President sent for former
Senator Felton while the latter was in
this city a few days aso in relation to
this matter and that Felton suggested
the name of Garber. ;
Judge Garber is a Democrat, but the
President is quoted as saying that he
would not allow politics, or any other
consideration, to influence him in form
ing this commission save the fitness of
thp men for the work in hand.
"This is not a State appointment, but
a national one," said Senator Perkins
this evening, speaking of the proposed
appointment. "It is true that the Cali
fornia delegation was not consulted
about it previously, 'doubtless foi* that
reason. I do not; know -'how Judge
Garber's name was suggested, or why
it appealed to the President, causing
him to determine upon it. I have only
to say that I am glad California is
honored by" a place on the commission,
and 1 Judge Garber is a very capable
man.
"The first I knew of t s President's
intention in this, regard vr.s yesterday
afternoon, when I called at the White
House at the President's request, and
he informed me," said Senator Bard
to-day. "1 think ex-Senator Felton
suggested the name. Judge Garber, I
know, was highly esteemed by the late
Senator Hanna and is so by Senator
Beveridge. I have no opinion to ex
press concerning the selection, but will
do so by my vote when the appoint
ment comes up for confirmation."
MAY NOT ACCEPT PLACE.
Several members of the California
delegation are of the opinion that Judge
Garber will not accept the appointment,
on account of his years and the ne
cessity of-his traveling to the isthmus.
The Canal Commission will be com
posed of seven members, two of whom
will be chosen from the army and navy.
Of these Admiral Walker, president of
the present board, will be one, and Gen
eral Davis, now in the Philippines, an
other.
Engineer Randolph of Chicago, who
constructed the drainage canal! will
also be of the number. No formal an
nouncement of the personnel of the
commission will be made before the
ratification of the treaty, which will be
made next Tuesday. * <i
Chairman Sherman of the Committee
on Indian Affairs, agreeable to a prom
ise made the California delegation this
year, has made provision in the Indian
appropriation bill for a depot to be es
tablished in San Francisco for supplies
for the Indian reservations on the Pa
cific Coast. At this depot the supplies
will be concentrated 'and from there
distribution will be made.

Charcoal is a remedy thut tys mor*
you take of it the better; it *s not a
!rug at all. but simply absorbs the
B^see an<3 Impurities alwayj j.resont in

â¢i\:vr.\ out of the r: - st?n-
Charcoal sweetens the breath ntier
drinking or after â¢i.iTms
.culons and other odorous vegetable*.
' Charcoal effectttally clears and im-
pcoyes the complexion: it whitens the
.-tfeth and further ctcti as a natural
â¢ snd eminently cafe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious prases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the ir.outh and throat from
the poison cf catarrh.
A31 drugrgists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the
best charcoal and the most for the
money is in Stuart : s ASjsorbent Loz-
pr.se?; they are composed of the finest
powdered nillow charcoal and other
, harmless antiseptics in tablet form or
rather in the form of lar^e. pleasant
tasting losensres. the charcoal being
mised with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges xvill
fcoon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
jjlexion. sweeter breath and purer
blood, and the beauty of it is that no
possible harm car. result iron their
'continued use, but, on the contrarv,
great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges to
all patients suffering from gaÂ« in
stomach and bowels and to clear the
complexion and purify the breath,
mouth and throat; I also believe the
liver is frreatly benefited by the daily
use of them; they cost but 25 cents a
box at 'drug stores, and although in
fomc sense a patent ztreva ration, yet
I believe 1 pet more and better char-
coal in Stuart's Absorbent Ix>zenges
than in any of the ordinary charcoal
tablets. '

DEBATE STIRS
LEGISLATORS
Brisk Speeches Delivered in
the House of Representatives
Before Holiday Adjournment
MINORITY IS ARRAIGNED
Speaker Becomes Weary of
the Forensic Controversy and
the Lawmakers Go Home ward
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20. â This was
fiÂ»ld day in the House. The naval ap
propriation bill was under considera
tion and the discussion encompassed
various topics, much of it revolving
more or less around politics.
After Mr. Dayton (Republican) of
Virginia of the Committees on Naval
Affairs had pleaded for a larger navy.
Mr. Hitchock (Democrat) of Nebraska
declared that there was gross national
extravagance in the annual appropria
tion bills. He asserted, too that the
larger items In the army and navy
supply bills went to the trusts. Mr.
Hardwick (Democrat) of Georgia pre
cipitated a discussion on the Philip
pine question by declaring that the
retention of the islands was respon
sible for the demand for a larger navy-
Mr. Townser.d of Michigan ar
raigned the minority for the action
toward the Panama canal.
Mr. Thayer having asserted that the
Democrats were not opposed to the ca
nal, Mr. Townsend said that the minor
ity leader. Mr. Williams of Mississippi,
had found it necessary to make such a
declaration. Mr. Townsend said he had
been able to discover the Democratic
position on the canal from the speeches
he had heard complaining of the Gov
ernment and ether speeches in opposi
tion to what had been said. At 4:45 p.
m. the committee arose and the follow
ing bills were passed:
For the relief of setUers on lands* in
Sherman County. Oregon; to regulate
the practice of medicine and surgery
in the Indian Territory; regulating the
practice of pharmacy in the Indian
Territory; to ratify the act of the Leg
islature of Arizona providing for an is
sue of bonds to build a station for ag
ricultural experiments in Arizona.
Payne moved to adjourn. Williams,
standing in the center of the aisle well
down in front, moved that when the
House adjourn it be until Tuesday in
order that proper respect might be
paid to George Washington.
The Speaker said that the. motion
of the gentleman from New York had
precedence, whereupon Williams
moved that a recess be taken until
Monday noon, at which time Wash
ington's farewell address should be
read and afterward the House should
adjourn. The Speaker announced
that the motion of Mr. Parne took
precedence over the motion to take a
recess.
Williams then appealed to Payne to
withdraw his motion, that the House
might adjourn over in memory of
George Washington.
Payne replied it would be more
patriotic for the House to be in ses
sion on Monday and celebrate the
birthday of George Washington by
preparing to build a navy than to
spend the day about Washington. Wil
liams suggested that the galleries were
empty and *again appealed to Payne,
but the latter adhered to his stand.
"Then." sail* Mr. Williams, "I will
give notice that on Monday I will move
that there be read in the House the
Farewell Address of George Washing
ton, In which he advised his country
against being 'involved against en
tangling alliances.* "
Amid calls for the regular order, Mr.
Williams concluded by saying he would
add to the motion that the House ad
journ, that the remainder of the day
might be spent in silent contemplation
of Washington's greatness.
The Speaker, bringing down the
gavel, Eaid that the gentleman from
New York having made his speech, the
gentleman from Mississippi having
pleaded a setoff and the gentleman
from New York having rejoined, he
would put the motion to adjourn.
Several noes were heard on the Demo
cratic side and the House adjourned at
5:10.

BARON SEEKS
SCHWAB'S LIFE
Titled Parisian Announces
That He Is Furious and
Boldly Insists on a Duel
Spgpial Dispatch to. The Call
PARIS, Feb. 20.â Baron Rogniat, who
subscribed $26,000 as a French Under
writer to the shipbuilding trust, want3
to fight a duel with Charles M. Schwab.
"I am furious with Schwab," said
the Baron to-day, "and will prosecute
him for defamation and robbery. It
v/ag Schwab who Inspired defamatory
articles in newspapers that have ap
peared about me. I am glad to catch
him here, and will apply the French
law to him. The public will not be
sympathetic with him. I would like
to fight a duel with him, and will try
to arrange one. I will defend my
honor and pocket against him and all
men."
When Schwab was asked concern
ing the suit for the recovery of $26,000
which it was reported Baron Rogniat
would begin against him he said:
"I have had no meeting: with Baron
Rogniat; I don't know him and have
had no business relations with him.
Indeed I never heard of him until I
read something in the newspapers
which was riot to his credit. I am
here entirely for a holiday and am
not thinking of any business, espec
ially of the shipbuilding business.
Baron Rogniat has not paid me ans'
money and the French have not put
any money in any business of mine.
Why therefore should they complain?"

The judges on the quality of fruit,
at the conclusion of their report said:
"And now a word as to the exhibit
as a whole. We have attended very
many of the* biggest citrus fairs in this
State and, while we have seen many
which would far excel that of Clover
dale, so far as the quantity of fruit and
number of varieties is concerned, we
have never seen a more artistic display
or a better quality of fruit, as a whole,
got together anywhere. Your oranges
arc not excelled jdfcl the lemons on ex
hibition are equal to those produced
anywhere in* California. It is evident
that Cloverdale can grow citrus fruit
and, from the taste displayed, the en
terprise manifested in the getting up
of these fairs and the energy shown in
their management, it is further evident
that Cloverdale is abreast of the times,
and that her people do credit to the lit
tle paradise they Inhabit."
The judges .were John Isaac and
Alexander Craw.

ASHLAND, Or., Feb. 20. â The
fourth annual convention of the Pa

Agents opened in this city this after
noon with an attendance of, nearly
100 delegates. A large amount of
business was transacted and an ad
journed session will be held to-mor

Oregon, Washington and British
Columbia were represented by about
forty-five delegates and their wives
and California by about eighty dele
gates and their wives. The citizens of
Ashland received the visitors from the
coast with true Oregon hospitality.
They were met with -hearty welcome,
banqueted and made to enjoy them
selves at a ball.
Besides disposing: of matters of
routine business they extended an in
vitation to the American Association
of Traveling Passenger Agents to hold
its 1905 convention in Portlland and
ordered the appointment of a commit
tee to carry the invitation to the next
meeting at the City of Mexico. San
Jose, Cal.. was selected as the next
meeting place of the association and
the following officers were elected:
B. H. Trumbull of the Illinois Central,

Lord Salisbury was absent-minded to

Salisbury was talking with the mon

table.v He examined it thoughtfully
and then said: "Poor old duffer; I
wonder if he is as stupid as he looks."

KANSAS CITY. Mo., Feb. M.-Lo
/â¢enzo Crosby, said to be an elder in
the Mormon church, while en route
from Atlanta, Ga.. to Hc-lbrook, Ariz..
shot and fatally wounded himself, in
a berth in a Pullman on the south
bound Chicago and Alton train to-daj?
near Higbee, Mo. He was brought to
Kansas City arid placed in the City
Hospital, where it is said he cannot
live longer than twenty-four hours.
Until 1902 Crosby was 6tatio-ned at
Richmond, Va., and was a member of
the Virginia Conference of the Mor
mon church. Later he was transferred
to Atlanta, where he has lived until
recently. Crosby was unconscious
when brought to this city. Ui his pock
ets were found two letters.^cme signed
Mollie Crosby, from Greer, Ariz., ap
parently from his wife, and which in
dicated domestic troubles, and another
signed Olive, from 353 West Fifth
Street South, Salt Lake City. Crosby,
who is 35 years old. shot himself twice,
one bullet penetrating his brain. He
was treated by a railway 6urgeon, who
occupied a berth in the same car with
him, but little to-uld be done for him.
The trainmen said that there had
been nothing unusual in the conduct
uf Crosby. He retired late last night.
Crosby wore clothes of a clerical cut
and carried â¢with him the report book
used by elders in the Mormon church,
besides some memorandum books. His
report book indicated active work for
the church of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints in Virginia, but there is no
record of his work in Atlanta.
SALT LAKE CITY. Utah, Feb. 20.â
Lorenzo Crosby, who attempted sui
cide on a Chicago and Alton train near
Higbee. Mo., is not known at 353 West
Fifth street South, the address on a
letter found on his person. Crosby is
said by church officials to be a travel
irg missionary of the church. His home
is said to bo at Eagar. Ariz.

Columbia Bowling Association Files
Suit Against Its Former Presi
dent and Manager.
The fight between the directors of
the Columbia Bowling Association for
control of the affairs of the concern
resulted yesterday in the filing of a
suit for an accounting against A. H.
Beebe. former president and manager
of the concern. The suit is brought
in the name of the Columbia Bowling
Association and is based on the charge
that Beebe ran the concern to suit
himself and did not make proper re
turns to the association.
It is alleged in the complaint that
Beebe, by a resolution of the board of
directors, was removed from the posi
tion of management on the 4th inst.
and it is charged that for the year he
acted as manager he collected large
sums and failed to make returns for
all the money to the corporation. No
amount is stated, but it is alleged that
as the receipts of the association
amounted to $60 a day, the amount
retained by Beebe must be very large.

STOCK MARKET
CLOSES STEADY
Upset in the Paris and Berlin
Bourses Produces Slight Ef
fect on Investment Shares
BANK - LOANS DECREASE
Professional Traders Attempt
lo Advance Prices After
Failing 1 to, Send Them Down
NEW YORK, Feb. 20.â The char
acter of the stock market showed no
change to-day from that of the whole
week. The effects of the day's de
pressing factors were very moderate
and were well resisted. But once the
depression was overcome all Interest
in the market abruptly ' terminated.
There seemed to be a waiting demand
for stocks on any declines, but no
buyers were qt hand to follow any ad
vance. The principal pressure upon
the market came from foreign sources.
This was well absorbed and prices
were at no time down to the London
parity. The sentimental effect of the
decided upset in the Paris and Berlin
bourses was very slight. The severe
declines on the Paris Bourse are at
tributed to the financial needs caused
by the shrinkage in Russian securi
ties, which are a poor sale at the pres
ent time, so that necessities must be
met by the sale of other securities.
The special weakness of state funds in
Paris might, however, be due to inti
mate knowledge of diplomatic affairs
not available to other centers, which
would explain its greater sympathetic
effect on other foreign markets.
The favorable bank statement was a
help to the resistance of depression
here. The $7,544,000 increase In cash
was not unexpected and is attributed^
to a return of money from the SouthT
where the follapse in cotton specula
tion has decreased the immediate need.
Some of the money sent to Baltimore
is believed also to have come back.
The loan decrease is evidence that cor
poration borrowings have been large
ly supplied out of the previous loan
expansion. It is probable also that
the proceeds of railroad loans are left
on deposit with the banks pending
the need for employing the funds
which are available to the loan mar
ket in the meantime. The market
closed about steady and not far from
last night's level.
ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS.
The week's market for stocks has
been duller and , narrower than for
nearly four years past, Monday trans
actions falling to a total of sales less
than for any day save one since the
summer of 1900. The news of the
week has not been favorable to ad
vancing prices, but the adverse de
velopments have been almost equally
without effect in bringing sales upon
the market. The stubborn resistance
of the market to all unfavorable fac
tors has prompted the "professional
traders once or twice to attempt to
advance prices after testing their abil
ity to depress them without success.
The occasional | upward movements
here and there were without news to
account for them and were quite evi
dently due to the testing operations
of traders, who are at the end of their
resources to effect'a sufficient move
ment of prices in either* direction
to afford a basis for their daily opera
lions.
The professional operations have
made up almost entirely the market,
the action of which or its non-action is
evidence of the -strong hands in which
the stocks are at present lodged and
of the small speculative position open.
Holders are apparently indifferent to
the day-to-day developments, and seem
to be content to hold their property
for more propitious market conditions.
The same spirit is seen in the policy of
the railroad companies to negotiate
temporary loans at a comparatively
high rate of interest rather than to at
tempt to issue new securities at a time
when the demand is listless and almost
stagnant. At the same time an occa
sional selling movement at one point
or another proves to be almost without
effect on prices, giving the impression,
in view of the narrowness of the mar
ket, that potential support lies behind
it. The effect this week has been to
cause almost absolute rigidity. The
continued large borrowings by railroad
corporations have been- viewed with
mixed sentiments. The continued sta
bility of the money market in face of
these demands and future requirements
in view has left little room for appre
hension Â«f any restriction of credits
on that account.
BANK LOANS DECREASE.
The publication of the comptroller's
compilation . of, national, bank returns,
as of January 22, makes it evident that
the loan expansion of the last few
months has been restricted to New
York banks, the New York increase for
the period reaching $78,000,000, with the
aggregate for the whole country show
ing only $4,000,000 increase. This show-
Ing of heavy decrease in ..the bank
loans outside of New York confirms the
belief that the low rates for money
have caused" the sending of Idle funds
to New York banks for deposit rates of
interest, thus in a measure forcing
those institutions to . find employment
for their deposits. This condition de
prives the railroad borrowing of any
menace to the money market. . To some
extent It has been viewed as an indi
cation of the fntention to continue plans
of betterment and . thus insure- large
expenditures for material. " ~ -
The railroad borrowing has. another
cide, also, which gains lmpressiveness
from the steady downward tendency
In railroad earnings. ' Wallljstreet has
dwelt much for a long time past on the
large proportion ;of railroad earnings
which have been "diverted to better
ments and permanent improvements
and which would not have a permanent
place in the operating expenses where
they have been figuring.
SMALIi DEMAND FOR MONEY. â 
The present borrowings indicate no
immediate prospect of reduction of ex
penditures ahead ' of " dividend J claims,
and In some cases they are for the
funding of expenditures already made
and classed in charges on earnings.
Meantime the declining tendency of
gross earnings continues, the decline

EUROPE WILL. F9RM A
COMMERCIAL ALLIANCE
Plans Arc on Foot to Resist the En
croachments of the United
States.
BERLIN, Feb. 6.â It is now consid
ered certain ..that a new Central
European Customs Union will be
formed under the presidency of the
Duke of Schleswig-Holstein for the
protection of â  European ; countries
against the United States. rv
Several meetings have been held dur
ing the last week and' prominent repre
sentatives of trade, industry and agri
culture from all States in Germany,
Belgium, Holland and the Scandina-'
vian countries have been present.
The idea of forming a union of this
kind emanates from Professor Wolff,
who has presided at all the meetings,
and who explained that the aim of tlfc
society is to establish a Central Euro
pean Economic Alliance for the pro
tection of European producers.
Although the United States has not
been, mentioned at any meeting, it is
evident* that the regulations adopted
are first of air directed against Ameri
can competition. The only obstacle to
the formation of an effective union Is
the attitude of France, which at pres
ent seems disinclined to co-operate
with Germany In this field.

BANKS RECORD
CASH INCREASE
Statement of JXew York Insti
tutions Shows a Big.. Gain
That Is Very Encouraging
NEW TORK, Feb. 20.â The Financier
says: The striking feature of the of
ficial statement of the New Tork banks
last week was the net increase of $7,
455,400 in cash to the maximum of the
year. This amount of increase closely
corresponds with the gain of $7,617,800
which was estimated upon the basis of
the traceable movements of money
during the week, including Thursday,
February 11.
This correspondence between the
bank statement and the estimated gain
is the mora remarkable because the
statements of the two previous/ weeks
showed wide discrepancies, that of Feb
ruary 6 indicating a loss of $2,500,000,
while tHe estimate called for a gain of
nearly that sum, and the return of Feb
ruary 13 showing a decrease'of $1,666.
000, -whereas the estimates indicated a
gain of more than $2,000,000.
Moreover.the statements of the pre
vious two weeks included one day
k which was omitted in computing the
estimates. The deposits last week in
creased $1,668,100, and consequently the
required reserve was augmented by
$417,025. this sum from the
net gain of $7,544,400 cash as above,
leaves $7,127,375- as the increase in sur
plus reserve to $27,506,000. This, It may
be noted, is the maximum of the year
and within $474,175 of the highest sur
plus reserve in 1903 K which was recorded
on January 31.
Computed Upon the basis of deposits,
less those of 537,997,500 public funds, the
surplus last week was 537.005,975. The
loans were reduced $5,131,100, reflecting
the light demand from Stock Exchange
borrowers and commission houses re
sulting from the inactive speculation.
The statement was probably made
upon risng averages for cash, this hav
ing been an apparently unrecorded
movement of money representing de
posits of public funds which have been
sent hither from interior points in an
ticipation of the treasury call for their
surrender. The" movement of money
from the South to this center was also
large toward the end of the week.
Comparisons of loans show that five
of the larger banks decreased their item
by 55,000,000 net; changes in cash indi-

Reported Discovery of Gold and Cop

DENVER, Colo., Feb. 20. â Miners
and prospectors are very much excited
over the reported discovery of a vein
of gold and copper twenty-five feet
wide at the grass roots at Bowerman.
Gunnison County, Colo., and people
from all parts of the State are moving
to the new camp. Much of the vein
matter, it is said, carries 30 to 40 per

have been assayed showed more than
$5000 gold to the ton. Bowerman is
easily accessible, being within fifteen
miles of both the . Denver and Rio

of the country $2 78 per capita.
cated that four of. the Institutions
gained $3,700,000 net. It is noteworthy
that the public deposits of the banks
were Increased last week by $842,700.
The statement showed a good proof, the
sum of the gain in cash less the loss In
loans being only $645,200 greater than
the increase in deposits. .

Iteccivc Censure of History

SPOOXER DEFENDS
NATIOX'S, EXECUTIVE
Says That if >Vc flad Abandoned
the Treaty the French Gov
ernment Would Have As
sumed Our Responsibilities
WASHINGTON. Feb. 2O.-Panama
was the subject of three speeches in
the Senate to-day and was the only
subject 6f general importance. Spooner
completed the speech begun by him
Thursday, and Morgan and Money both
made brief addresses. Morgan spoke in
opposition to the treaty, as usual, and
announced that he would not be heard
again on the treaty. Money announced
his intention of voting for the ratifica
tion of the canal treaty, but criticized
the part taken by the United States in
connection with the secession of Pan
ama.
During his speech Spooner engaged
in a spirited colloquy with Tillman., He
defended the President against the as
sumption that his position on Panama
Involved the. right of the Southern
States to secede.
Morgan declared that the vote on the
treaty was being unduly hastened, and
asserted this haste to be due to com
plications with the new Panama Canal
Company.
Money in a speech said: "Whatever
broken faith or blighted honor at
taches to the country was not brought
on by the Democratic party; neither is
either branch of Congress responsible.
The censure belongs to the administra
tion and its supporters, as they are ac
cessories after the fact."
ATTACKS ADMIXISTKATIOX.
Money declared that the President's
course in violation of international law
had been such as to render it indefensi
ble. He was sure that this and other
acts of the United States in connection
with the Panama revolt would deserve
and receive the censure of history. But,
bad as our course had been in Panama,
he said that it was no worse than our
course in Hawaii and the Philippines
had been. He also contended that the
President had been wrong in his recog
nition of Panama, but concluded that
as he had given it . recognition it was
established and its rights as a nation
fixed, and this status being fixed the
new republic had a* right to enter into
the treaty. . *
Money referred' to the action of the
State Legislature '' of '~ Mississippi re
questing him to^ vote for the canal
treaty, saying that that request had as
much influence with him as would be a
command.
Spooner resumed the speech which
he had -begun Thursday last. He said
that if the United States had aban
doned the treaty the French Govern
ment would have assumed our respon
sibilities, which this nation would not
have tolerated. He declared it to be
strange that men who had spoken with
such feeling of the condition of Cuba
before the Spanish war should not havÂ»
had a word to say for Panama.
In response to a question from Till
man Spooner defended the orders of
the Government of. the United States
prohibiting the landing of troopg with
in- fifty miles, of the canal. Till
man said that the United States never
would havn interfered. In Panama's af
fairs if the canal had not been involv
ed, and Spooner replied that the Presi
dent had obeyed the acts of Congress
In all that he. had done.
The President, Spooner contended,
had every reason to believe that the
Government of Panama was stable,
for Colombia, without treasury or
navy, and with a small army and no
means of reaching Panama, could not
be expected to be very formidable. He
said that if the South Carolina Senator
had been in Panama he would have
been the chief conspirator there.
DEFENDS PRESIDENT.
Tillman replied that his antagonist !
had paid him a great compliment.'
Spooner retorted tljat in makfrig "this
admission Tillman was conceding all |
he had himself been contending.
Tillman would not, however, admit
that he had any high regard for the j
Colombians. "I have 'called 'em a|
mangy lot," he said, "'and the Senator
from Wisconsin has made 'em a man
gier lot than I have."
Spooner then' entered upon a discus
sion of the question of the benefits to ]
be derived from the canal, the Presi
dent's right to recognize and Colom
bian ownership of property in the Pan
ama Railroad and' Panama canal un
der present conditions.- On'' the last
named point he took issue with Mor
gan, contending that Colombian own
ership had passed with her sovereignty.
Referring to the President's course, j
Spooner- said that no one need roll un
der his tongue as a swee{ morsel the !
contention that in recognizing Panama i
the President had committed himself!
to the secession of the Southern States,
which was, he said, an 'epjirely differ
ent matter. That would. do for Confea- j
erate Daughters* meetings, but not for i
Confederate themselves.
Culbersori asked:.' "How about the
president's Capon Springs speech?"
Spooner declared Ihat^the doctrine of
secession. in this, country.. had. been suf-^
ficientry covered . by Daniel Webster's j
reply to Hayne as not to render it!
necessary to go into (hat question."
Moreover, . the American secession had '.
failed. â¢ .-.';.. v -^ . .. . .
"But,", asked Tillma.ri, "would we
have failed if we had had in France !
or England a big friend like Panama I
had in the United States to keep' you i
people away? 1 ' - -.- ~ ; .;Â«y;

FOURTEEN DIE
IN PARIS FIRE
Explosion of Gas in a Celluloid
Factory Starts Blaze That
Soon Envelops the Building
PARIS, Feb. 20. â Fourteen em
ployes of a celluloid factory at the
Boulevard Sebastopol and the Rue
Etienne Mariel lost their lives to-day
In a fire which started by an explosion
of gas. Twenty others were injured.
The explosion, which occurred In a
room on the fourth story, drove bricks
and pieces of glass against a house on
the other Eide of the street and im
mense jets of flame followed imme
diately. Soon the entire structure was
on flre.
Simultaneously with the appearance
of the flames a number of men and
women employed on the upper stories
and who had been eating their lunch
eon appeared at the windows and
shrieked for assistance. Three men
attempted to drop from a 'window to
a balcony beneath but missed it, fell
to the pa,vement and were killed. The
firemen arrived shortly afterward and
devoted themselves first to' saving as
many of the endangered persons as
possible. Several were Rescued.
One couple showed great presence of
mind, occasionally opening a window
for air and closing it to prevent the
spread of the fire.
It was not long before the flames
were under control nnd then a search
for the dead was made. In a corridor
leading to the street five of the vic
tims were found against the wall. They
had been asphyxiated and incinerated.
In all fourteen bodies were conveyed
to the Morgue, where they await iden
tification. â¢ Five persons â¢ were taken
from the b,uilding badly burned. Two
of them w/111 die. The damage to the
building will not exceed' $10,000.
Bcnguiat Remains at the Palace.
'For a few days Benguiat & Son. will

HASH MOUSES
IRE OE SAILORS
Two Score; Men -on the Govern-
ment's Big Jt)redge Chinook
Off Astoria Quit Their Jobs
Special Disratch to The Call
ASTORIA, Oh, Feb. 20.â Because of
the fact that hash had been fed them
for seven consecutive days ' forty-one
men employed upon the big dredge
Chinook, formerly the transport Grant,
have quit their places and come ashore.
For six days hash had been given
them for breakfast, and they caucused
and determined to complain if }t was
again furnished for the morning meal.
On the seventh day hash adorned the
breakfast table. One of the men was
sent aft to file a complaint with Cap
tain Dunbar, and he was discharged.
The others quit upon learning of the
discharge of their mate. The number of
Strikers is one-half the strength of the
vessel's complement.
The French bark La Bruyere, long
overdue from Port Lgs Angeles, reached
port late this evening. She should have
made the run in fifteen or eighteen
days, and was thirty-six days on the
trip. Fifteen per cent reinsurance had
been offered on her 'at San *Francisco.
The bark first ran into calm weather,
and then met with storms, which drove
her north as far as Cape Flattery.
Before reaching Port Los Angeles the
bark had lost, her fore topgallant mast
off the Horn, and a hole was stove in a
forward plate. Repaiip were not made
at the California port* but the damage
did not interfere with the vessel's run
up the coast. She was never sighted
after leaving Port Los Angeles, and
the fear was growing that she had been
lost.

INSTRUCTIVE STUDIES
BY NOTED MEN AND
WOMEN
Russian X antes.
â¢ By Jerome B. Landfleld. I'niveraity of Cali-
fornia.)
The most puzzling feature about the
present war in the Far East would ap
pear to be the difficulty of spelling sAid
pronouncing the Russian names. The
list of the vessels engaged in the naval
battle at Port Arthur, as contained In
Viceroy Alexeiev's official report, looks
like a mass of ingenious typographical
errors, or the disastrous mixup of a
runaway linotype. As a matter of fact,
however, the difficulty which Russian
names present to the American reader
is greatly enhanced by the fact that
most of them, in the forms in which
we see them, do not come to us directly
from the Russians, but suffer from a
passage through the French or the
German before reaching us, and most
of the names involved in reports of the
present war are the wild guesses of the
conVfpondents, who for the most part
are acquainted with no language save
their own.
Russian names are at best by no
means simple, because the Russian
makes fine distinctions of sound which
arc scarcely perceptible to the ears of
Americans: but there is no reason why
they should be still further compli
cated by the grotesque spelling which
French and German writers employ in
order to imitate in thÂ«ir own languages
the Russian sound. As a matter of fact
the words which flow from the facile
tongued subjects of the Tsar find a
simpler and truer representation in
our own forms of spelling: than in
either of the other languages men
tioned.
It is out of the question to attempt
here to give the Russian characters
and their English equivalent, but it is
entirely possible to sketch the lines of
a simple, natural and uniform system
of transliteration which, by a compari
son of the French and German forms
frequently met with, will enable the
casual reader to recognize Russian
names under their various forms, their
correct spelling and their approximate
pronunciation. Some words, to be sure,
have become conventional in a form
which does not correspond at all to
the Russian spelling or pronunciation
and these can very well be left alone.
â "Moscow." for example, the Russians
spell and pronounce "Moskva." The
name of the Viceroy nc-w in charge of
Russian affairs in the Far East is cor
rectly spelled "Alexeiev," but we are
already so familiar with the popular
form "Alexieff" that it is probably best
not to tamper with It. On the other
hand, if you notice that a writer upon
Russian affairs calls the autocrat of
all tfte Russias "Czar" instead of
"Tsar" you can make up yc-ur mind
that he is ignorant of the Russian lan
guage arid gets his information at secJ
ond hand.
It is possible without any reference
10 the Russian characters, but simply
by a comparison of French and Ger
man forms, to formulate a useful and
fairly simple If not complete system
of transliteration and pronunciation.
As to accent, the majority of Russian
names, especially tlibse ending in 'jov,"
"ski" and "vlch," take the stress upon
the next to the last syllable, as. for
example, "Romanov," "Alexeiev," "Ma
karov" and "Turgenev." The ending
"vich" means "son of," and "ski" is
simply an adjective ending similar to
the German "isch." One of the difficul
ties of Russian proper names will be
simplified if it is borne in mind that
the Russian always has three namesâ
first, his given name; second, the given
name of his father with "vich" at the
end of it. and third, his family or sur
name. Sc, for example, the name of
the present Tsar is Nikolai Alexandro
vich Romanov, or Nicholas Romanov,
son of Alexander Romanov.
For a system of transliteration it
v.-ill, perhaps, be simplest to mention
various English letters or combinations
of letters and the French and German
forms which should be replaced by
them. The changes chiefly to be ob
served are as follows:
"Ch" should always replace the Ger
man "tscb" and the French "tch," as
Gorchakov.
"G" is always hard; where the French
am obliged to write "gu" on this ac
count they should noi. be copied, as
Turgenev.
For "kh" German writers use "ch,"
which is much too guttural to represent
correctly the Russian, writing Astra
chan for Astrakhan.
**S" and *"z" have their, exact equiv
alents in Russian, but German and
French scholars frequently use "s" for
,the latter and "es" for the former, writ
ing Wassili for Vasili, and Rasumowskl
or RasoumoffEky for Razumovskl.
"Sh" should be used for the German
"sen" and the French "ch." as Dash-
For "ts" the Germans write "z."
â¢V" correctly transliterates the third
letter of the. Russian alphabet, which
French and German writers have vari
ously represented by "w" and "ff," e.
S.. Vorontsov. To be sure "ff" at the
end of a word more correctly approx
imates the Russian pronunciation, but
for the sake of uniformity it is much
better to use "v" in all cases, and this
ueage has been adopted by the authori
ties of the British Museum. The Rus
sian character for this letter is."B,"
and to this was due the mistake by
which Sevastopol was formerly writ
ten Sebastopol. ,'â  $
"Zh" should be used where the
French use "J." so Nizhni Novgorod.
The vowel* "e" and "i" must be re
tained as iu French and German with
their continental pronunciation (eâ a
and i â e); but "I" (German "J" and
French "y" in some cases) standing be
fore a vowel has its force as a conso
nant. In Russian these combinations
are expressed by single characters and
we take our translation from tile Pol
ish: thus Dieblch has two syftbbles and
Paskievich has three. "Y," however,
may be used at the beginning of a
word instead of "I." as in Yermolov.
For "u," pronounced "00" when not
preceded by "i," the French use "ou,"
writing Zouboft for Zubov.
Perhaps the most confusing Russian
names in connection with the conflict
in the Orient are those of the vessels
of the Russian fleet. I These are, to be
sure. In many cases long and difficult,
but a number of them can be simplified
by applying the above rules. The nanies
given the Russian battleships and
cruisers are usually taken from Rus
sian history and mythology, while the
names applied to torpedo-boats and
torpedo-boat destroyers express quali
ties and remind one of the names of
the many English war vesssls.
It may not be amiss* to mention the
English equivalents of the names of
some of the vessels which occur in the
dispatches concerning events In the
Far East. Among these, for example,
are the "Cesarevitch," which means
"Son of the Tsar," or "Crown Prince";
the "Bolarin," or "Boyar," the title of
the Russian noble in early times;
"Pobieda," or "Victory"; the "Petro
pavlovsk" and the "Sevastopol," named
after two .Russian cities;' the "Per
esviet," or "Around-the-World"; the
â¢"Variag." or "Varangian"; and the
"Askold," named after the legendary
founder of .Kiev. Among the torpedo
boats and destroyers are to be noted
such names as "Vnimatelni," or "At
tentive"; "Bezstrashni," or "Fear
less"; the "Vnushltelni," or "In
spiring"; the "Rasyashchl," or the
"Elucldator"; the "Silni," or the
"Strong"; "Grozovoi," the "Thunder
er"; the "Serditi," or the "Angry"; the
"Steregushchi," or "Picket," and the
"Smieli." or the "Bold."
It is hardly to be expected that the
average reader will pronounce correctly
the difficult combinations of letters and
sound which the Russians employ, for
there is no royal road to the learning of
the "Russian language, but the above
suggestions and explanations may be
of some assistance to him. And where
these fail to help, one can only add to

The Dutch and the leadin? natives
in Java are of the opinion that the
population is increasing too rapidly
for the good of the island. The census,
taken every five years, has long shown
an increase of over 2,000,000 for each
census oeriod, and the rate of growth
has constantly accelerated. The in
crease of population from the census
of 1895 to that of 1900 was over
3,000,000. Java is only a little larger
than New York State and the central
regions are too mountainous for a very
dense population. The fact that the
last census showed a total population
of 28,745.698 indicates a frightful con
gestitm of humanity over all the coastal
and interior plains and valleys. The
density of population is 568 persons for
every so/uare mile of surface, which is
greater than in any province of China,
excepting In Shantung. If France had
the same density of population its in
habitants would number 120,000,000; the
United States at the same rate would
have 1,688,000,000 inhabitants, which is
about 100,000,000 more than the esti
mated population of the world. Such
packing of humanity as this at least
illustrates the fact that when every
acre of tillable land is stimulated to its
highest productivity it will give sus
tenance to several times the number of
persons who are now supplied with food
from an acre of land in most countries.
The Javanese are still able to raise all
their raw food and to export the pro
ducts of their plantations and forests to
the amount of millions of dollars a
year. But they are already talking
about a time to come when they will
no longer be able to produce on their
island all the food they require.

After he N has sold out to the morn

as they leave the street cars, ferries
and bridge and pour into the down

to bed. It is estimated that there are
between 15,000 and 20,000 , boys who
sell newspapers in the streets of New
York. Hundreds, of these have no
homes in > the ' city. - They have run
away from parents in other cities, or
their parents are dead, or- frequently
these boys of the street are the chil
dreÂ« of irresponsible or criminal men
and women. So the night newsboy
when his work is. done goes to some
lodging-house on or near the Bowery
not far from Newspaper Row and gets
a bed for a dime or 15 cents. And he
sleeps in the lodging-house until af
ternoon. Then he goes out into the
streets again, taking a bite at "one of
the many cheap restaurants which
newsboys frequent; and pretty soon
his hoarse and resonant "fog-horn"
voice is telling again the startling tales
of a dav in the world.
The "real" newsboy works at night
because he can make more money
then. A "kid" told me that he made
$3 50, in one night; and that was his
record, his earnings being smaller usu
ally than a dollar. The boys who have
homes and parents and who . attend
school sell their papers in the day r

OAKLAND RESPONDS. .
THE CALL has been very earnest in urging the
cities of Northern California to use the climate to
their advantage, by planting palms at street trees,
instead of using elms, ash, sycamore and other decidu
cus trees. It goes without saying that trees which cast
a shade are not desirable. The evergreens, like
cypress and acacias, have that fault and their lateral
roots interfere with the sidewalks. But the palms have
a tap root, do not throw out laterals and do not make a
thick shade. The palm is always and everywhere a tropi
cal feature in the landscape, and no other plant excels it
for indoor decoration.
The hotels in this city that have the space required
use boxed or potted palms with splendid effect, for dec
oration. If they adopted the idea held by some who are
insensible to climatic advantages, they would put in de
ciduous trees, to lift their bare. branches before. the eyes
of Eastern tourists. If palms are used only indoors
and deciduous trees are put on the streets, the impres
sion made upon travelers is that palms grow here only
indoors. This docs rank injustice to California. If we
are to use only the trees that are bare of foliage for half
the .year, we might as well all wear wool caps with ear
flaps, put on arctic overshoes and thrummed mittens and
assume the same wintry aspect as people who live in the
zero-minus belt.
We have endeavored to enforce the utility of palms in
all our cities where street planting is possible. They
may be used elsewhere with" fine advantage. Our Cali
fornia railroads spend a large amount of money in pub
lishing magazines and in other means of advertising the
State. If they would spend some in planting palms on
both sides of the tracks, using the date and fan varieties,
they would get the most satisfactory results. Imagine
the effect upon Eastern travelers at this season, if -they
could ride through a splendid palm avenue upon enter
ing California, after a journey of 2000 miles through
frost and snow and bleak winter. In some parts â  of
Southern Europe, not favored as much by Climate as we
?.re, the railroads have roses planted along their tracks,
which in. their season of bloom make a charming im
pression upon passengers. Our roads can have the roses
loo, but they should use the palms as well. The Out
door League of California is interested in this subject
and can do a great work for the State by preaqhing the
gospel of the palm for streets. â¢
The attention that we have given to the. matter has
stirred a responsive chord in Oakland. The Real Es
tate Association of that city* has passed resolutions de
precating the use of deciduous trees on the streets, on
the ground of the litter made by the fallen leaves, the
interference of the lateral roots with sidewalks and
sewers, and the wintry aspect of the bare branches in the
.season when the most Eastern visitors come here. Now,
real estate men are sometimes considered to be the s*ns
of Belial, but those of Oakland enroll themselves among
the children of light, by showing the desire to beautify,
their city by making the best,use of its splendid situa
tion and clement climate. They resolve in favor of the
palm, and we strike palms with them with sincere pleas
ure. They are promoting the construction of a scenic
boulevard in the mountains, leading to the highway tun
nel which connects their city with the rich valleys of
Contra Costa County.
They know the value of an appeal to the eye, and ap
preciate the importance of garniture when it comes to
selling real estate. In fact, they are important allies of
the Outdoor League. It seems, by the text of their
resolutions, that the City Council has become deciduous
and proposes to make the town melancholy during the
winter months by lining its streets with elms and ma
ples, and they pray the city government to retreat from
this position and take refuge under the palm. Their
action is part of the great awakening that has been
caused by the appeals of The Call. In California north
of the Tehachapi we have been a matter-of-fact folk,
going at a jog trot, content with our mines and mills,
our orchards and vineyards, and looking upon the
adornment of our ranch house surroundings and the' or-
namentation of our cities as a rather secondary matter,
not having' in it dollars and cents. But now we are
learning that climate is an asset, out of which we get
dividends not only in crops and manufactures, but also
in using it for the purposes of ornamentation in outdoor
beauty, to catch the eye, allure the fancy and open the
purse of visitors and investors. The people of Clovcr
dalc are doing this with their citrus fair. If they were-of
the deciduous school, they would avoid showing the
orange, lemon, pomelo and olive, and instead would
invite the Eastern tourist to view an exhibit* of corn and
wheat and oats, turnips, beets, the pungent onion and
well-baled hay, pickled and hams. We may well
go to Cloverdalers, study 1 their ways and be wise.
McKowen must serve four years and nine months' im
prisonment in the State's penitentiary for a theft of

hardly been given time enough in which seriously to re*
fleet upon his crime. Many ; men in the world, other
wise honestly intentioned, would be tempted to earn
the same sum of money in the same way under any con
dition except disgrace. '
LET THE v SPARROW FALL.
THE mistaken importation of the English sparrow
â¢into this country .has produced evils- that were not
foreseen. The bird was originally brought with
the expectation that it would prey upon the insects which
attack our trees. This was done in ignorance. All
insect feeding birds Jiave "long, slim and pointed beaks.
The seed eaters have the short pyramidal beak. The
English sparrow advertises itself as jof the latter class.
Professor Dychc, an Arctic explorer and naturalist;
who lives in Lawrence, Kansas, has been studying this
bird in that locality. He, finds that it is spreading into
the country, and everywhere drives away the birds of
song" that feed on insects. It is becoming a, fruitVeater;
and mixes its diet by attacking field crops also. Profes
sor Dyche says that he ha'd to plant a field of. turnips
three times, before he got a stand. The sparrows
scratched out the see.d and consumed them, takihg'Teven
the sprouted" plants, when they" had developed : two
leaves. They attack fruits, spoiling more than they
consume, by pecking 'it, and by knocking off a great deal
of ; it.-' â  â¢>- .-'' '. ' â â  â '- '<:â â : :->y :^s â¢
These findings against this noxious immigrant -are of
impo'rtance to California. The sparrow returns nothing
to the fruit grower for his board and lodging, for he
eats none of the predatory insects. A robin and black
bird, will take a little fruit desser\, but they earn it by
making their main meal on moths, larva and insects that
injure the orchardist. On the other hand," the sparrow
dines on field *seeds and tops off on fruit, and makes
iqo return by destroying insectPor by a song.
. Within the last -two years the English sparrows in
California have discovered that figs are. good to eat.
Many instances are^known in which they have destroyed
the whole crop in an orchard. They find the seeds and
pulp to be just what they require, and as fast as the
fruit ripens they peck into it and destroy it. It seems
like fighting the sands of the sea, or the motes that
shimmer in the sunbeams, to fight the myriads of these
undesirable birds, but we have no doubt that unless,
something is done to reduce their numbers they will
be found a> formidable, pest in the orchards. We have
just begun the shipment of Smyrna figs. Last year our
export amounted to 680 tons, and California will soon
supply the American market with the best variety of
dried figs. But if the sparrows continue to spread from
the towns into the country, -the. Smyrna fig orchards will
Se in danger. . . ;
One efficient means of fighting them is by destruction
of their nests and eggs. They are as keen witted as
they are destructive, and soon retreat from any place
where their nests are disturbed. In the cities they have
met that sort of campaign and that is probably one
reason why they are going into the country, where the
facilities for nesting are better and they can brood un
disturbed. The horticulturists of this State should take
measures to meet this invasion, and if necessary public
authority should be invoked to secure the extermination,
of this scolding, chattering pest. The birds may easily
become in this country the equal of the rabbits of Aus
tralia as destroyers and require equal attention to their
destruction.
It is noted that as they retire from towns the robin.'
grackle. and, oriole return and take up the campaign
against destructive insects, with benefit to the shade' and
fruit trees. We are not aware that the sparrow is a
nuisance where it is a native, in England. But here .it
is an immigrant ungrateful for its asylum in the land of
the free.
England/ inspired by that keen sense of precaution
that distinguishes her when she sees herself drifting
into trouble and wants others to share her burden of
consequences, is scouring through Europe for friends
who do - not like Russia/ Thus far in her search
Britannia has discovered the chilling fact that all of
those that do , not like Russia have an equally emphatic
dislike of England.
EMOTIONAL INSANITY.
W- E believe the first plea of emotional insanity in
a court in this country, in a case of homicide,
was made for the benefit of Daniel E. Sickles
after the shooting of Key. Its advantages were at once
seen by practitioners of criminal law, and we have built
up an elaborate system of inquiry into the mental state
of, ancestors,- near and remote, of persons accused of
murder. In a majority of such cases the plea of in
sanity is entered and experts and family history are used
by the defense. In Europe this plea is not as common
as it is here. 1 ' When a man kills another there, unless'he
is' actually in; a madhouse at the time, it is concluded
that he 'was morally/responsible for -his act, and homi
cide gets whatever restraint there is in prompt punish
ment.' Perhaps this has something to do. with the in
crease of murder in this country, and it would seem as
if the' legal profession ought to consider its responsi
bility in the matter, and that legislatures and courts
should' apply the brakes, and permit a little more hang
ing in proportion to the amount of murder.
/In a noted case some testimony, was offered that- is a
rare contribution to medical jurisprudence. A medical
expert 1 testified that the accused came to him for an
operation for appendicitis, and upon the statement vof
the patient only he operated and found no indication of
that disease, as his vermiform appendix was the picture
of health. This testimony was held to be evidence that
the man was insane. If there can be fun in such a grew
somc affair as' a murder case, this is funny. The doctor
depended upon the patient's diagnosis of his case and
trustfully explored his interior with the knife, not on bis
owh judgment as a doctor and surgeon, but on the non
professional statement of the explored individual.
Things are reciprocal. If that doctor, should have the
misfortune in hot or cold blood to kill some one, unpro
fessionally, his attorney could plead insanity and offer
this incident in proof of it, arguing that no sane physi :
cian would resort to laparotpmy on a patient's mere say
so, without satisfying himself that disease existed war
ranting that extreme resort to the knife. To accept such
expert testimony is to open the way to immunity from
punishment for murder, since an intending murderer, will
only need to have himself operated on for a disease that
does. not exist to establish his insanity, and then can
bring down his enemy with a pot shot and throw him
self with confidence upon the mercy of the experts.
We believe that here, as in Europe, the rope will prove
quite an exterminator of emotional insanity.
"If- they send- us to the bottom say a good word for
us." What cry of patriot and hero could be more.elo
quent than that, uttered by the commander of a Rus
sian cruiser .'-who \vent v bravely out'at Chemurpo to fight
against, overwhelming odds anTf went down" to death

TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
The. Meanest Man.
"Heretofore the man regarded as
the meanest in the world," said a
member of the Press Club, "was a
man who buttoned his collar to a wen
on the back of his neck to save buy
ing a collar button. But he is so no
longer. The meanest man is in San
Francisco. I had occasion recently to
ipvite him to dine with me at a down
town restaurant. We happened to get
a little French waiter who had pre
viously waited Â§ n me and who had
been so over-zealous to earn a tip that
he had .not permitted me to eat in
peace. I mentioned the incident to
my guest, who said he would cure the
garcon.
The latter recognized me., and a
prospective tip at the same moment
and began over-earning his money.
I noticed my guest quietly put a quar
ter- alongside of his plate, just in
sight but not far enough out to jus
tify its being taken. The waiter saw
the bait and began to speed up. As
the dinner progressed the quarter was
replaced with fifty cents. The garcon
saw it and renewed his efforts to
please. The guest smiled benignantly
on the biscuit mercury and later re
placed the half with a dollar. Then
extras from the kitchen began coming
our way and we were all but swamped
â with attention. Finally the black cof
fee arrived and as it was being drunk
my guest reached over, took up the
dollar, and calmly putting in itV place
a nickel, walked out. The waiter
stood aghast and speechless while I,
hesitating to spoil my brutal guest's
joke,' paid the bill at the counter and
followed him to the street."

Judge was one of a committee of-citi
zens who went across the bay to meet
and welcome the humorist upon his
last visit to this city, which occurred
shortly before his death. As the" party
were returning with their Illustrious

the ferry-boat, they passed the im

Tzvo Singers.
A poet wrote a wondrous song.
So liquid-like it flowed along
From brain to pen refined; â¢
The bard a scholar was and rare..
Who smoothed each thought, In utmost
care,
And. made his lines as softly fair
As sighs of Elysian wind: . Â»
Yet lived they only, on the page; j
They held no cry, nor moan, nor rage,
Nor grip of human kind. . â  ' â 
A singer made a rough-garbed song
Thit pulsed with life, and throbbed
among
The working, heart-stirred crowd;
'Twas wild and sweet, yet tinged with
pain;
It mouthed the sorrows, loss and gain.
Of harassed souls-who strive in vain
To 'scape life's awful cloud;
It spoke the woes of fate-crushed men;
It breathed of>tlmes when joy again
Would lighten hearts care-bowed.
New years went by; great changes came;
The poet fine was lost to fame.
And e'en his memory cold:
His works lay molderjng. all unread;
Save by the few who prize the dead.
And starve the bard who asks for bread;
But o'er the land that bold
True song of rude-tongued bard was
sung;
It seemed as though to Time it clung
And ne'er would lose its hold.

A Record Break.
Not since Hugo's famous Thenardier,
leader of the rogues in "Les Miser
ables," has * there been such a remark
able prison breaker as that de
scribed by the Matin. Says this paper:
"Extraordinary Ingenuity was shown
by a burglar named Vandenwegaete,
who/ escaped recently from the under
ground condemned cell In â Lille jail,
in the north of France, where he had
been specially confined on account of
his notorious cunning and his open
boast that he would find. a way out
before long. ?./
"The cell is furnished with a single
massive door oprfiiripr on a corridor
at the end of which is another door,
provided with a 'safety lock.' One
evening the prisoner was locked up for
the night; the next morning his cell
was empty. The .bird had flown, and
two false keys made of tin found out
side the door. of the corridor told their
own tale*
"A search, in the cell has enabled the
prison officials to piece together the his
tory of this daring deed. Â« With part of
the. bread supplied to him Vandenwe
gaete took the. impression of "the locli
of hjs cell. y : With Some' more â¢ bread he
made a mold, In -which he cast a key
out of a' fin cup, the "metal being melteti
on ; his : stove." ,
"Thesame night] he opened his door,
took a bread crUmb' impression" of the
corridor lock, made another key and
soon found hrtmself outside the corridor.
From a cupboard he abstracted a sheet
and a broom handle, which he tied to
gether and made his way into the
prison yard, which is surrounded â¢ by a
wall, topped with broken glass.
"Fixing the broom handle between
two bottle ends he threw the" knotted
sheet over the .wall and slid: down It
into the street. His hextmove was to

Education in Sivcdcnl
Sweden seldom attracts ttie attention
of the average. Americani teacher, al
though in -matters .educational it has
many lessons for educators throughout
the world. The' standard * of ; popular
education in Sweden, has been steadily
rising from the time of- the
tlon ; and the . indications point to even
greater, efficiency ahead. It should be
noted, that a large preponderartce â¢ of
the kingdom has of a' rural
character and", public education has
been- adapted 'most' closely .to', a tricul-
tural needs. The first beginnings of
the national school system were mada
In 16S6. In that year a law was enact
ed to insure for all children a sound re
ligious education, so far as reading and
knowledge of the Lutheran catchlsm
were concerned. In 1842 the national
compulsory law of education was intro
duced. Modifying acts have appeared
since, but the present system comes
from that date. As a result of Its ex
cellence, practically every one in tha
country can read* and write.
Laze of "Ancient Lights." I
Englishmen, at least the more pro
gressive among them, are finally awak
ening to the absurdity of an old law
which establishes what are known as
"ancient lights." Under this law win
dows which have been in existence for
nineteen years or more cannot be de
prived of light by the construction of
neighboring buildings without du&
compensation having been made to thÂ»
owner. In other word3, an owner of
land cannot erect a building which will
shut In a^ny of the windows of neigh
boring buildings, providing the latter
have been in existence for nineteen or
more years, without making himself
liable to extensive damages. Moreover,
the damaged owner can prevent the
erection of any such building which
will take away his light if he wishes to
do so. The light, by virtue of the time
he has enjoyed it, has become a part
of his property. Efforts are now being
made to have this relic of past ages
repealed. It is this more than any
thing else that has prevented the erec
tion of high buildings in London.

to be urged upon the wine growers
that they have- a auty to perform in
the direction of giving financial sup
port. The exhibit will cost from $5000
to J6000. Relatively a small part of
the needed coin has been raised to
<?ate.
\ In the circular letter It is set forth
that the exhibit of California wines at
SL Louis will be artistic and novel.
There will be seventy-two spaces for
exhibits and ten cases of wines or
brandies are needed for each exhibit.
All wines entered for competition must
'VÂ» packed in separate cases and sten
ciled with the word "jury." At least
three bottles of each variety that is
:r;ror.ded to be submitted to the jury
"Â« ill be required. All exhibits will be
tinJform. In part the circular letter
sent out is as follows:

DEMAND FOR UNIMPROVED
LOTS BECOMES STRONGER
Large Tracts in Richmond District, to Be Cut Up in Sub
divisions and Covered With Good Class of Buildings.
Interest in All Parts of San Francisco Remains Active
Great interest is now manifested in
the realty in the Richmond district in
this city. There has not been such a
stir in that section since the first cable
road to reach the park via Point Lo
bos avenue and Fifth avenue sup
planted the antiquated and smoky old
dummy line that used to operate on
First avenue. Many blocks of land
are placed in the hands of brokers to
be subdivided and tha promise' of a
much greater population than the
Richmond section has ever had is
about to be realized unless all signs
are misleading. All other sections of
the city are receiving attention. Rich
mond has hunjj fire to some extent as
compared with what may be stylod
ins'de lands, .but it is now forging
ahead well. J. C. Jordan, owner . of
the Jordan tract, which extends from
California street to Point Lobos ave
nue and from First avenue, for four
blocks eastward, comprising some
eight large blocks of land valued at
about $1,000,000, has decided to sell a
portion of his holdings. Realizing
that the holding intact of this huge
property was to a great extent a hin
drance to the development of this por
tion of the city, and also realizing that
the property was in demand, he
has Just placed In the hands of Lyon
&, Hoag for sale the block bounded by
California, Richmond, Michigan and
Jordan avenues.
Mr. Jordan's instructions to his
agents are to depart from the tradi
tional 2 5 -foot lot idea and to offer the
property in large lots, nearly all of
which are 33 1-3 by 120 feet. It will
also be a condition of sale th;it pur
chasers will not be allowed to erect
on this block any building more than
two stories In height or any building
for other than strictly rosldenti.nl pur
poses (Including two flats), elimina
ting the use of the property for stores,
churches, stables, laundries, etc. The
large lots and the building restric
tions, Jt is confidently expected, will
make the property very desirable and
attractive to home builders. Mr. Jor
dan's ideas are unique, as this is the
only property of its size ever offered
in this city under similar conditions.
Lyon & Hoag report that ho bet
ter proof that the city of San Fran
cisco Is growing and developing
rapidly can be given than is evident
! by the strong demand for. residence
property. Owners of large tracts of
unimproved land ( have been quick to
realize the vast' difference in the de
mands of homeseekers to-day as com
pared with the inquiry for building lots
of the last few years. Ncr more im
portant factor in the development of
the city may be found within the last
year than the subdivision and the of
fering for eale in lots for building pur
poses of the Bay District Land Com
pany's large holdings extending from
First to Sixth avenues and from Ful
ton street to Point. Lobos avenue, an,
area of fourteen full blocks. The de
velopment of the" Parnassus Heights
property along Golden Gate Park and
the sale of over half a million dollars'
worth of vacant property formerly
owned by the Baird estate, between
Page. Haight and "Waller streets. and
Masonic avenue to Cole street, as well
as other smaller properties and the
many buildings erected thereon have
made a most marked change in the
aspect of San Francisco.
The Bay District Land Company has
sold to Fernando Nelson a half of block
379 and a half of block 2S5, each hav
ing a frontage of 600 feet on Se"cand
avenue and 120 feet on A. B and C
streets, for $80,000. These half blocks
will be at once subdivided and sold in
wide lots to be covered with houses.
The Bay District Land Company has
also sold the block bounded by Third
and Fourth avenues and A and B
streets to G. T. Knopf, who will sub
divide and build good houses on the
lots.
SELL FINE RESIDENCE.
A sale of importance in residence
property has Just been closed by R. D.
Cranston & Sons. It consists of the
residence on the southeast corner of
Buchanan and Page streets and lot
137:6x100 feet. The house was designed
by Clinton Day. It. contains about
twenty rooms, all finished in chosen
hard woods. It has been justly con
sidered the handsomest dwelling in the
southern portion of the "Western Ad
dition. The sellers are P. B. and Bruce
Cornwall.
Parnassus Heights and the Sunset
District are building, up rapidly .and
new homes are being erected on nearly
all avenues where the sewers have been
laid and the, streets macadamizd in
side o-f Twenty-first avenue. -, The
United Railroads Company has recog
nized the importance of, this district
and put on twenty-eight new cars of
the most modern and up-to-date pat
tern. It is reported that all Ellis street
cars will in future have their terminus
at II street and Twentieth avenue in
stead of Stanyan street, as at pres
ent, which will be a great convenience
for this constantly growing district.
A good many H-street park frontages
were .sold to people of wealth, who will
erect elegant residences. Business In
this locality has increased to such an
extent that three men are constantly
employed in the branch office of Bald
win. & Howell. corner of H. street and
Seventh avenue.

Pike, under command . of Lieutenant
Arthur MacArthur Jr., and five boat

off Lighthouse Point, at the south end
of Mare Island. The ferry company will
run the steamer Vallejo to the scene of
the evolutions, the proceeds of the trip
being paid over to the clubhouse fund.
The Vallejo will start from the slip
at 1:30 a. m. The'submarlne boats will
skim along the water, dive beneath its
surface and discharge torpedoes. After
the exhibition, the Vallejo will take her
passengers back to the slip and the
submarine boats will proceed to Red
Rock, where they will give a , second
exhibition, which will be witnessed by
the passengers on board * two large
steamers carrying excursionists from
San Francisco and neighborhood. :. ..

BARNEY MURPHY
IN THE NORTH
Chairman of Democratic State
Central Committee Preaches
Gospel of Pacific Coast Unity
M00SER AS AN EXH0RTER
Monticello Statesmen and Iro
quois Braves Surprised at the
Missionary Work in -Oregon
The Democratic National Conven
tion will meet in St. Louis on July 6.
The California State convention of
the party will probably meet In Sacra
mento during the latter part of May.
Election of delegates to "the Statecon
vention from the leading: cities of
California .must take place on: the
first Tuesday of May. In the halls of
Monticello and In the .wigwams of the
Iroquois there are many inquiries as
to the whereabouts of . Barney Mur
phy, chairman of the State Committee,
and many expressions of '.wonder why
a call has not been issued for a meet
ing of the governing body of the party.
The Call ascertains definitely that
Barney JJurphy is In the open field
doing" missionary work. The follow
ing message by wire from Portland
tell3 what the eminent statesman la
doing: and where he is going:.
&rnator nerrard D. Murphy, chairman of the
California State Central Committee, and LÂ». H.
Mooser, treasurer of that organization, ara In
Portland. Their object In visiting Oregtm 1Â«
to consult . with members, of the Democratic
party and "endeavor to brine about unity of
action between tUe delecates from the' Pacific
Coast State*. ' California is anxious that Ua
influence will be felt in the convention In a
way that would assist in securing recognition
â¢.of the West. It Is believed that this can' be
accomplished by explaining: to a number of
leading' members of the party In each State
the idea and securing their efforts to have
their resijective ' delegations send representa
tives to a muetlnc to be arranged later.- to
a^ree. If possible, on a course of procedure
that would make the delegations from west Of
the continental divide stand ns a unit.
â  After leaving: Portland Murphy and Mooser
will visit Washington. Idaho. Utah. Nevada,
Arizona and -New Mexico, to explain to the
members of the Democratic party in those
States and Territories their hope for united
action by Western States. â  ;
'Murphy and Mooser deny that their tour
is In the Interest of W. R. Hearst, but indi
cations are that it Is. It Is believed here
that .their missionary campaign is for the
purpose of arranging for a caucus of Pacific
Coast delegates to the National Democratic
Convention, which would bÂ« dominated and
controlled by the California delegation.
Inquiries addressed to' leading
Democratic politicians of San Fran
cisco bring to light the fact that
Chairman Barney Murphy was not
especially commissioned by the Demo
cratic State Central Committee to ne
gotiate for harmony. It is ascertained
further that his northern tour was
not planned by the Monticello Club or
the warriors of the Iroquois tribe.
Leading Democrats last evening . ex
pressed surprise when told that Mur
phy and Mooser were at large preach
ing the gospel of Pacific Coast unity.
It is said that Chairman Murphy fa
vors, a young, aspirant for the Presi
dency. ; Treasurer Mooser is classed
as a firm supporter of Judge Parker
for' the Democratic nomination.

Sergeant of Police Fears Another B!ai$e.' Murder; but Finds
Only a Misguided Mexican Trying His Gunâ -Judge Alo
gan Will Stand Treat for Johnsonâ u Gon" Sullivan Held
Sergeant of Police Christiansen was
disrobing in his "Green street' home Fri
day night preparatory to retiring after.
a bard'day's work in Chinatown when
the sound of tivo revolver shots rent
the air. They came from the direction
of Russian Hill, and the gallant police
man &w In his mind's eye , another
murder, more tragic and daring than
the crime that cost Joseph Blaise hla
life.
Hastily he thrust his fset Into his
shoes and pulled his socks over them.
Then he threw hi3 trousers under the
bed, wrapped himself in a quilt and
grasping his trusty gun rushed forth in
the direction of the firing line.
He had traveled about a block at
double quick when he met up with
Guaragua Fidele, a Mexican bootblack
employed at a California street barber
shop, taking careful aim at the clouds
that hid the moon and preparing to cut
loose again with his smoke wagon. ThÂ«
officer laid a detaining hand on the
bootblack and led him away.-to the City
Prison. A search disclosed another re
volver, and Fidele was looked upon as
a very bad man.' r
The case was in Judge Cbnlan's court
yesterday and was adjudicated by
Judge Cabaniss. who presided during
the absence of his fellow jurist. Fidele
told the Judge that he had been in
formed by his employer that it was
lawful to -carry concealed weapons pro
vided the packer had $60 on his person.
FTiday night the bootblick had $70 in
his pocket, lawful money of the United
States, so he carried two guns. If he
had riossessed 5100 he probably would
have thought himself entitled to a bat
tery of artillery.
When he fired the two shots, he said,
he was merely trying" his. weapons to
see if they worked all right. Judge Ca
baniss dismissed him without a fine,
but not before he had compelled the
defendant to listen to some sage advice
about carrying' and discharging fire
arms within the city limits.
John Johnson was once a" mill hand.
Then he became a common laborer, and
finally a bum. Since last November he
has done no work of any kind and has
remained continuously drunk, while
kindly neighbors fed his delicate wife
and three little children and an excep
tional landlord allowed them to occupy
their cheap home on Lafayette street.
r He was before Judge Mogan yester
day on a charge of neglecting to pro
vide-for his minor- children. He told
the Judge he had been unable to obtain
employment and had no money.
"Nevertheless," said the Judge, "you
have managed to keep a bun on during
these dreary months of starvation. How
wa* that?"
- "Well, your Honor," said Johnson,
"my friends treat me when I go down
the line."
"I find you "guilty," said the Judge;
"and it will be my treat Tuesday, " at
which time you are ordered to appear
for sentence."'

Judge Fritz .yesterday held Con Sul
livan, R^welWknown sure thing man,
to answer to .the.; Superior Court in
bonds of J2000 on r a charge of grand

Frank Graham, .who claims to be a
bookkeeper by occupation, but who is
a thief by choice, came before "Judge
Mogan yesterday on a charge of grand
larceny. He was instructed and- ar
raigned and an attorney appointed for
him.
The defendant snatched a purse from
the hand of Mis* Katherine Ryan at
the safety station on Market street Fri
day night as she was about to board
a Haight-street car. She followed the
thief and her cries attracted Police
man Teutenberg, who pursued and cap
tured Graham. Just.before the capture
the thief threw away the purloined
purse, which contained ?5.

J. J. Ncilsen and Walter Morris, who
smashed a window in a haberdashery
iat.3 Grant avenue Tuesday night and
abstracted some wearing apparel, were
held for trial in the Superior Court on
charges of burglaryyesterday by Judge
Cabaniss;in bonds of 52000 each.
I The crime was particularly daring,
the hour and place rendering detection
almost inevitable. . The burglars were
captured by j Policemen Meredith and
Reihl, and when searched two formid
able revolvers, fully loaded, were found
on the prisoners. So far as known to
Â«ie police, the two young men have
never " been in ' trouble before. They
are electricians recently arrived from
the East. a,nd claim that their crima
was committed, in, order to secure suffi
cient funds to pay their, initiation fees
into the Electrical Workers' Union so
that they might secure employment.

OPERATIONS A FAD.
Public Gradually Awakens to the Fact.
The latest fad in operations ha3 been
the appendicitis . fad; before that the
fad for rectal operations (piles, etc.)
held sway. Hundreds of patients were
frightened and hurried into hospitals,
operated upon and robbed of their last
dollar, when the trouble was a simple
case of hemorrhoids or piles only, easily
cured at home with a simple remedy
costing but 50 cents a box.*
"I procured one 50-cent box of Pyra-
mid Pile Cure of my druggist, with the
intention of buying: a larger box later,
but was happily surprised when I found
that I was cured, and still have six
â¢pyramids' left out of the first and only
box. I have not had the least sign oÂ£
piles since I used this one box, which
has been about tvro months; previous
to using Pyramid Pile Cure I had the
worst Kind of bleeding and protruding
piles for over thirty-one years, and no
one knows, except those who have had
the piles, the pain and misery I suf-
fered.
"I am a poor man, but have, often eaM
I would give a fortune, if I had it, to
be cured of the piles, and now I hava
been cured for 50 cents. I should bs
very ungrateful if I did not thank you
and ffive you every privilege to uaa my
name and this letter, whin I knovr
there are so many who suffer as I did.
J. A. Weismiller, 1100 Bladensburs

The Pyramid Drug Co., Marshall,

causes and cure of piles, which they
will be giad to mail free to any ap-
plicant, and we advise ail sufferers
from this painful disease to write to

DROPS CLAIMS
OF RADIUM ORE
Company Quickly Follows Call's
Story AVith Offer to Repay
Stockholders Their Money
LAKGE LUBBLE COLLAPSES
Aubury Kciterates That Con
cern Is a Fake and Talks
About Sending People to Jail
â ' The California Radium Gold Mining
Company is going out of business. ThÂ»Â»
people Lack of it have decided to aban
don the claim that radium is found in
thÂ« ore produced by the company. Yes
â¢terday morning a statement -was made
in The Call that State Mineralogist
Aubury denounced the company and its
claim^cf having ore that carried radium
as a fake. After this statement ap
-.pearcd there was much excitement in
the office of the California Radium
Gold Mining Company. A representa
tive of the company went to the offices
of the State Mineralogist in the ferry
building. Later in the day Stuart Ar
mour sent a typewritten communica
tion to The Call, the important part of
which is published.
Incidentally the representation was
made to this paper that Aubury denied
that he had ever caid that he had de
nounced the Radium Gold Mining Com
pany as a fake. A representative of the
company said that Aubury had given it
a. letter in which he denied that he had
made anv statement to the effect that
the concern was a fake.
This raised a square issue of veracity.
There was no question that Aubury
did say to a representative of The Call
just $vhat was published yesterday
morning derogatory to the company, so
the State Mineralogist was asked
t\ hether he had written a letter for the
irtadium Gold Mining Company saying
that the company was not a fake. At
once and v.ith some warmth Aubury
denied that he had ever written any
such letter. "It is a fake," he again
said.
MAY GLTT MONEY BACK.
When the State Mineralogist was in
formed that in a letter addressed to
The Call Stuart Annour had asserted
that the company had decided to reor
ganize under a more appropriate name,
that it had offered to refund to its
stockholders the money paid in for
their stock and that it had abandoned
the claim that radium is found in its
ore, he raid that it was well that the
company reorganize and refund; that if
the money was not refunded he would
collect evidence for presentation to the
Postal Department of the United States
that "might result in sending parties
connected with the California Radium
Gold Mining Company to Jail.
The oersons who invested their
money In stock of the California Ra
dium Gold Mining Company, according
to the text of Mr. Armour's letter, may
â¢now go to the company's offices and
get it back. The explanation that the
company makes of its large advertise
ments, in which the public was eagerly
advised to Invest and wherein the cir
c umstantlal statement was made that
â¢â¢while It takes eight tons of the Euro
pean ore to produce one gram of ra
dium. It Is possible to produce the same
amount of radium from a few ounces
of the Marlposa County ore'"â Is that it
%ves led to believe tso by a chemist.
Just when the company decided to
abandon Its claim of owning ore In
Marlposa County from a few ounces of
which radium could be produced is not
made public. But no announcement of
i elinquishment of the claim was made
until The Call yesterday published the
straightforward statements of the State
Mineralogist. In s is interview Aubury
said:
"I will take all possible means to
Ti-arn the public that this is a fake, and
hope that the admonition will be widely
read for the credit of the State. There
is no radium in the Fitch mine ore. The
company that Is back of the advertis
ing Is trading on the spark of light
that the ore shows. It Is all a fake."
The vital portion of the letter that
has been sent to this office by the com
pany Is as follows:
NO RADIUM KXISTS.
"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 20. 1304
"To the Editor: Will you kindly pub
lish the fact that the California Ra
dium Gold Mining Company no longer
claims that radium is found in its ore.
It was led originally to believe that
fucIi was the case by the report of a
chemist who had been experimenting
with the ore and who exhibited what
he stated was salts of radium in a
Â« crtain stage of reduction. Other chem
ists have made and still make similar
claims but in view of the positive
opinions of Sir William Ramsay. Pro
fessor Kakle, Professor Lewis and other
eminent authorities to the contrary the
company is unwilling to assume the
risk of misleading prospective inves
torr. It has already offered to refund
to stockholders the money paid for
their etnek and lias decided to reor
ganize the company under a more ap
propriate corporate name."
Last evening Mineralogist Aubury
said that while no radium has been
fuund in California, he is not prepared
to say that none will be found. Pro
fessor Eakle of the University of Cali
fornia has sent letters to prospectors
throughout the State, asking that sam
ples of ore showing possible Indications
of the presence of radium be forwarded
to him for examination. Ores may yet
be found in California, says Mr. Au
bury. from which 'radium can be pro
duced.

TWO YOUNG PORCH CLIMBERS, WHO WERE CAPTURED IN ALA
MEDA YESTERDAY MORNING AFTER AN EXCITJ^'G CHASE
FOLLOWING THE ROBBERY OF M. M. SHELDON'S RESIDENCE.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 20. â Harry Knox
and Ernest Schultz, boy porch climb

this morning after an exciting chase,
In which Miss Gazella Kower, Rev.
Gilman Parker. Hairy V. Parratt and
Detective George H. Brown partici

served the lads scaling veranda posts
and forcins windows in the residence
of M. M. Sheldon, 2202 San Antonio
avenue, adjoining her own home. No
members of the Sheldon family were
in the domicile, being absent at Chlco.
After young Knox had ransacked the
residence he attempted to depart' by
the front door, but was. confronted by
Miss Kower, who grasped the Juvenile
porch climber by the collar and called
to Harry V. Parratt, who- was pass
ing, to take her captive to the City
Prison, While the latter Vas perform
ing this duty Knox broke away and
started to run. Parratt, who is a large,
fat mar., sped after the fleeing boy,
and Just as he was about to lay hands
on the runaway youth he tripped and
both went down together, the lad be
neath. The fall took the wind. out of
Knox and the dignity out of Parratt.
While the man with the adipose was
recovering his equilibrium Knox again
took to his feet and disappeared. Later
he visited the police station, to answer
to a charge- of discharging an air gun
within the city limits, which was pre
ferred against him yesterday, and he
was immediately taken into custody on
the more serious charge.,--'".
While Knox and Parratt were run
ning and falling Scliultz climbed a rear
fence on the Sheldon premises, >and
was pursued by the Rev* Gilman.'Par
ker and others, whose attention had
been attracted. He was finally caught
by Detective George H. Brown, and,
with Knox. is now detained- In the City
Prison. The. lads probably will ; ' be
turned over to the Juvenile Court.
Knox Is the son of Sv. C. Knox . of

â¢The family formerly resided here in
the Sheldon house. The, boy is J3
years of age and Is regarded as a klep
tomaniac and an incorrigible._ He came
here Thursday from Sari . Francisco
with Schultz, both being, armed -with
air guns and bent on hunting Japanese
warriors. Schultz is H years ioO age,
and his home is at 1910 Baker street;
San Francisco. He affirmsthat he was
until recently an attendant at < the ;Pa
clflc Heights School and that. Knox at
tended the Madison School./
Knox has been in .trouble; with. the
police here before. /He' was once ; ar

another time for entering a Japanese
hut and stealing, a gold 'watch/
Some years ago young Knox -under-

went a trephining operation at the
County Infirmary. Doctors held that
the lad's mania for stealing was" due
to a pressure on the brain, and the op
eration was performed in the hope that
it would reform him.
Knox stated Jn the City Prison to
day that he entered the Sheldon house
to find a bucksaw he had left there
three years ago, when his family oc
cupied the place.

MONTE YESTERDAY. â¢ ~ ' â¢
DEL MONTE, Feb. 20. â Walter S.
Hobart's Silver. Dick, king .of .the
quarter horses of two- continents, de
fended his title nobly this : afternoon at
the inaugural meeting of the California
Polo and Pony Racing Association.
Cleverly ridden .. by Lawrence ,Mc-
Creery, he won both his starts, in. the
first- breezing in arid in the second
willing by a nose. . ..
Sliver Dick and Becky were known
to be the class of the "ponies in ,the
first 'race, /and all ..the others were
scared out. The "betting., throughout
was slightly in favor of Silver . Dick,
who was installed' an 8 to '10 favorite.
Lawrence McCreery. who proved the
cleverest gentleman' rider of the day,
sported the : colors . of Walter Hobart,
red with maltese crop. R. M. Tobin
wore the colors of Rudolph Spreckels
on Becky, cerise, with green fleur de lis.
Silver Dick showed. the manners of a
perfect gentleman' at- the" post, being
as easily handled as a Shetland pony.
There was one. false start and then the
two great ponies were sent on their
journey. 'Dick outbroke Becky at the
start and won. under restraint by two
lengths. After the race Mr. To|jin said
he did not knowifwas a start, owing
to . the confusing . orders of the , star ter,
and that he threw "Becky out of her
stride whan. he finally'got away. ....
. Silver Dick nearly met with a reverse
in â¢ his next start, over aS distance of
three-sixteenths of a mile. With F. J.
Cardan's chestnut â¢ mare Bonnie he
raced out in front j of the field of five.
All the way through the stretch they
ran like a double .team: ' As they ap
proached the'.wire Mr. â  McCreery drew
his .whip Vand .â Siiver]Dick;re^iwndÂ£!d
gamely. Mr. Carolan rceased his urging

Lawrence McCreery laid. too far, out'.of
it with Lotrix in the early, "part of the
journey. He had too much ground to
make up when the stretch was reached
and finished j a poor, second.
Fusillade is one of. the be3t bred po

ASKS TRAFFIC AGENTS
TO MEET IX THIS CITY
State Board of Trade Extends Imita
tion to Hold Association's >*ext
Convention Here.
The Pacific Coast Association of
Traffic Agents held its annual meeting
and banquet at Ashland, Or., yester
day. This body of railroad men has
a membership of about 300 and is
composed of the traffic officials, both
freight and passenger, representing thtÂ»
various railroads in the United States.
It has held its annual meetings at
Ashland for the last two or three
years, as the members are located
from Seattle to Los Angele3 and they
have considered Ashland a sort of
middle way meeting point. Mr.
Fletcher, who is a member of this Pa
cific Coast Association of Traffic
Agents and who has attended their
previous' meetings and Is personally
known to all of them, sent Jay W.
Adams, the president, the following
telegram as- secretary of the California
State Board of Trade:
Accept the best wtshÂ«Â« of the California
State fio*<d of Trade for an enjoyable anil
successful mÂ«etlsy. We extend a most corJial
invitation to your association to hold itÂ» next
annual meetlr.x in San Francisco. /
It will be a good thing for San Fran
cisco and the State of California as
well if this invitation is accepted.
Would Dissolve Partnership.
Two suits for a dissolution of part
nership were filed yesterda*. One is
by Abraham Sweat against K*rry
Markovltz and the other by Arthur
Prlddle against Thomas Croke. Sweat
claims that Markovltz has taken $300
more than he isentitled to from their
livery business at 1123 Mission street,
and Priddle claims Thomas F. Crokc
is taking more than his share of the
profits of their contractins business.
Struck by an Engine.
Joe Eviade, a Mexican, residing at
San Mateo, fell asleep on the railroad
track near his home yesterday and

SPORTS OF THE RACECOURSE, DIAMOND AND TENNIS COURT
HORATIUS TAKES HANDICAP,
BEATING GOLD MONEY A HEAD
Jennings' Mare Is
Heavily Played
at 6 to S-
Ingleside track is now a thing of the
past as far as the present racing eea
son Is concerned. The feature event
of the closing day was a 51000 handi
cap over a mile, for which Gold
Money, the crack mare from the stable
of Walter Jennings, had a command
ing call in the betting. Horatius,
Kenllworth and Jockey Club were also
numbered among the starters, but
Gold Honey, with her 111 pounds.
Btruck the fancy of the big half-holi
day gathering until at post call 6 to 5
was the market quotation. So, when
Haratius, ridden by J. T. Sheehan,
dropped from tha clouds and beat the
favorite a head on the wire, it does not
require a vivid imagination to picture
the astonishment and grief wrought
by the bay horse's victory. Kenil
wertn did the best he could with his
117 pounds, cutting out the pace for
nearly three-quarters of the route,
with Martin, on Gold Money, sis his
close traveling companion. Down the
back stretch Horatius, which had met
corns Interference on the clubhouse
turn, was last of tha field. Before
making the bend for home Martin had
taken the leading position from Kenil
â¢worth, and, as Jockey Club was being
urged by Tommy Burns, everything
augured well for the Jennings entry.
Many contend that Jack Martin grew
overconfident with the race apparently
won. failing to perceive Horatius in his
winning rush. At any rate, Horatius
arrived in time to receive a head decl
fion over the favorite In 1:40^. Jockey
Club was third.
While not at its best, the track was in
good condition. Favorites appeared to
more advantage than for some days
past, four of six purses going to short
priced ones.
Fcr lack of better material Quiz II,
from the McCafferty stable, was in
stalled favorite for the introductory
Eprint u odds of 8 to 5. It was figured
that Bonner might outride the other
boys, but the best he could do was to
finish third. Dr. Sherman, the second
choice, -well ridden by Buxton, led
Pruewood out half a length. The lat
ter would have won at a trifle longer
distance.
Harry Stover's colt George P. Mc-
Near made his field look like 30 cents
In the two-year-old scramble, at throe
and a half furlonps. The big son of
Torso went to the post a 6 to 5 favor
ite, wirh fie<? in the saddle, and won
under restraint from the head of the
stretch. Tar Baby, which came in for
considerable support at 20 to 1, led
Dixelle, the second choice, out for place
honors. Kdith Vice ran a wretched
race.
There was a. very scaly look about

the seven furlong selection, captured
by Whiskers, and it left a dark .brown
taste in the mouth. The Petaluma
mystery w;is hammered down to 11 to

first by two lengths, with the rank
outsider Goldfinder the closest con
tender. Fair Lady Anna cut out the
running until she had bellows to mend
and quit- Hipponax made no show
ing whatever, and Pierce J was so far
back under Sherwood's good manage
ment that a charge from one of the
big Russian suns at Port Arthur
would not have struck him. "Travers
presided over the destinies of the suc
cessful nominee. . .
Put for having' all the better of the
start Sad Sam would -probably have
bopn beaten in the closing six furlong
pelfing sprint. The jungle .demon, a
7 to 10 favorite, got away sailing, and
with little in reserve downed Mlmo
half a length. Hainault came from
back, getting the show, and it looked
as 5f he would have won with a more
even send off.

Douglass' Three-Bagger, Fol
lowed by. Cameron's Hit.
Brings Victory to- Presidio
The ball tossers that represent the
Presidio got away with another great
game yesterday afternoon and demon
strated beyond a doubt that they are
the amateur champions of the State.
They had as opponents an all-star nine,
representing the alumni of Stanford
and the University of California. After
eleven innings of sensational ball had
been played .the soldiers won by a score
of 4 to 3.
It was certainly the most sensational
battle that has yet been seen on the
Presidio ball field. The college men
fielded In grand form, not an error be
ing committed by any member of the
nine. On the other hand, the soldiers
were weak in the field, 2nd it was due
to their errors that the game was pro
longed for. two extra rounds.
Forsyth, the star . -twlrler of the bar
racks, was in his best form and had the
college men on his staff from the first
inning. He struck out nine men In all
and did not issue a single pass during
the struggle. Parker for the collegians
was also in good shape, and kept the
eleven hits made oft* his delivery well
scattered. ;
â¢ A remarkable thing about the game
was the wonderful throwing of the two
catchers. .Not a single base was stolen
during the eleven innings. Raymond
for the soldiers had a bad day and com
mitted three errors at the third bag,
all of which helped the college tossers
to score runs without the aid of base
hits.
The score was 1 to 1 up to the ninth
Inning. In the tenth the collegians
came through with two tallies. It
looked good for them, and the admirers
of the soldier team began to lose heart.
But the latter tied up the score in the
tenth, and then the real cheering began.
The collegians could not do a thing
in their half of the eleventh round.
Douglass for the Presidio team tore off
a long three-bagger to the left field
fence, which brought forth a round of
wild cheers from the spectators. Parker
sent in a fast shoot and Cameron con
nected with it safely, sending the leath
er out to center field and bringing In
Douglass with the winning tally. The

Vandalism In Asia Minor.
In 1872. H. B. Tristram, an English
man, discovered* a unique ruin on the
borders of Moab, a little east of the
HadJ road from Damascus to Mecca.
It was a gorgeous but unfinished palace
standing alone on the plain and known
to the Arabs as M'Shita (winter quar
ters). It has since been shown to be
the work of Chosroes II.. who flourished
in the first quarter of the seventh cen
tury, and it was designed by his fa
mous architect, Ferhad. It is the only
remaining example known o*f the
Byzantine-Sassanlan style of archi
tecture. Its most remarkable feature
is the vast sculptured south facade
with over fifty figures of men and ani
mals and innumerable fruits and
flowers delicately carved in the hard
limestone! It stood untouched for 1300
years and now it has been given by the
Sultan to Emperor William, who sent
men' to saw off the facade and take It
to Berlin. Archeologists regard it as as
great an act of vandalism as that
which brought the Elgin marbles to
England.â New York Commercial Ad

YACHTING BOOM
Approachins: Season Will Prob
ably Be an Important One
for Amateur Tars on the Coast
CLP BACES ARE PLANNED
Various Clubs May Be Induced
to Enter Boats for a Regat
ta in ' Northern Waters
Yachlinsr on the Pacific Coast is now
experiencing the greatest boom Jn its
history. From San Francisco to San
TJigeo. and from Puget Sound away up
into British Columbia a wave of en
thusiasm is spreading that has here
tofore been unprecedented. The* re
.sult of th:a interest is already appar
fr.t and unless ail signs fail the com
ir.g season will furnish some of the
nost exciting regattas ever held on
this seaboard.
The idea of international yacht
races on Pugct Sour.d, which was ad
vanced a year ago by prominent
yachtsmen in British Columbia and
Port Totvnsend. appealed strongly to
San Francisco and south coast club
men at the time and it i# likely that
an" effort will again be made to carry
it to a successful termination. The
suggestion met with much favor in
and ground Seattle and the response
of Victoria and Vancouver was en
thusiastic.
As outlined, the scheme was to have
a week of fine racing in August of each
year. The international event would
be conducted on the same lines as that
sailed â¢ for the America's cup in the
East. To lend interest to the sport it is
said English yachtsmen stand ready to
forward the Mackie international tro
phy here, to be held by the most suc
cessful contestants.
Of course, it would require a good
deal of money if members of the differ
ent coast clubs should comr>ete for the
â¢trophy independently of each other, so
it has "been suggested that each organi
zation join hands in entering a boat for
the races. This would bring the ex
penses down to a very low mark, and
the members v-ould hardly feel the loss.
But to go from one extreme to the
other., however, there will also be a
very lively racing season in the south
land. The fact that Sir Thomas Lip
ton has presented the Corinthians of
San Diego with a handsome trophy cup.
to be raced for by any or the Pacific
Coast clubs, opens another interesting
chanr.er in yachting circles, which is
*>eing freely discussed on all sides. Per
haps Los Angeles yachtsmen are even
more interested in the outcome of the
Lipton cup races than are northern
sports, inasmuch as a syndicate is now
building a large racing machine at Ter
minal Island, near San Pedro, with
which itjiopes to capture the pretty
trophy.
W. G. Morrow, commodore of the
San Francisco Yacht Club and owner
'of the fast sloop Challenger, which
won first honors in the regatttts on
the bay lust year, is of the opinion
that none of the local yachtsmen will
participate in the San Diego races. He
thinks the conditions under which the
â¦tip was obtained by the southern
club are too unsatisfactory to warrant
the lo*s of time and expense in taking
a boat to Southern California.
"Ordinarily it would require two
weeks to make the trip from here to
San Diego and back," said Commodore
Morrow, "and that would not give one
much time to become acquainted with
th* conditions there.
"Again, as I understand, the Lipton
cup cannot be removed from San
Diego if won by an outside yacht, so
that really It is scarcely worth the ex
pense and trouble of 'competing for.' "
Continuing. Commodore Morrow said
there is every promise Â« T a fine racing
season on the bay this year. The
Tiburun club ia now bui!dir.Â£ a racer
to go against the Challenger, which Is
to be' known as the Corinthian, after
thff name of the organization Across
the bay the California Club is making
i apid strides*, and almost without ex
ception yachtsmen report an excellent
outlook.

Shay of the San Francisco team were
on the batting lis| of the Independents.
"Jim" Lanagan 'uO, former Stanford
pitcher, occupied the box for Ireland's
team, playing his position in his old
time form.
The playing of the varsity ball toss
ers to-day was a great improvement
over previous exhibitions. But three
errors v/ere recorded against them and
of these two went to Chalmers, the
frer-hman left fielder. He is a new man
at the position and will undoubtedly
overcome his present tendency to care
lessness uefore the season is over.
While all of the varsity infielders put
up a good article of ball for this early
date in the season, Trowbridge, var
sity shortstop, was undoubtedly the
star performer in to-day's game. His
sensational catch of a low line drive,
resulting }n a triple play that closed
the game in the first half of the ninth,
was the feature of the game.
Despite the fact that Lanagan
pitched a nice game for the visitors the
varsity players landed on fiis delivery
for Â« ight safeties, or.e of them being a
two-bag-gtr by Wirt. ' Nearly all the
Stanford nine are battins well, a fea
ture of their playing that Is exceed
ingly gratifying to coach and rooters.
For the Independents. Danny Shay
v. as the bright particular star, accept- '
ing ten chances without an error.

THE SAX FRANCISCO GALL, SUNDAY/ FEBRUARY 21, 190i.
BERKELEY GIRL
WINS THE CUP
Ethel Ratcliffc Captures the
Jackman Tennis Trophy on
Golden Gate Park Courts
PLAYS A STEADY GAME
Miss Hazel Hotchkiss Disap
points Her Admirers, Making
Poor Stand "Against Victor
The Jackman cud, which was pre
sented to the Golden Gate Tennis
Club about a year ago, was disposed
of yesterday afternoon. Miss -Ethel
Ratcliffe carried off ihe handsome tro
phy by beating Miss Hazel Hotchkiss
in the finals. This is the third straight
victory for the winner, proving beyond
a doubt that she is the best woman
player in this part of the State.
Miss Hateliffe is a University of Cali
fornia student and a resident of
Berkeley. The cup has been played
for five times and every time has been
won by a Berkeley woman. Miss
Miriam Edwards won the first event
from scratch and Miss Hazel Hotch
kiss the second, playing from the same
mark. Miss Ratcliffe also played from
scratch and in four tournaments beat
Miss Edwards once and Miss Hotch
kiss twice. Miss Hotchkiss beat Miss
Ratcliffe in the second tournament.
In the first three tourneys the han
dicap players received odds much too
small to enable them to win. In the
fourth event the handicaps were in
creased, but to no avail. The scratch
players in the tournament just fin
ished were placed "half thirty" in
stead of "fifteen" back of scratch.
'fhe handicaps of the poorer players
were again increased, but the two
scratch players came together again
in the finals. The odds allowed were
very great and Miss Ratcliffe's victory
was a well earned one.
The tinal match was a sxeat disap
pointment. Miss Hotchkiss. was very
nervous and played much below her
usual form. Her net work, whiqh is
strong as a rule, was rÂ»oor yesterday.
On the other hand Miss Ratcliffe
played better than ever before. She
played almost eptirely in the back
court and her ground strokes v.ere
both speedy and accurate.
In the. first set Miss Hotchkiss won
the first two games, but Miss Ratcliffe
took the next five straight. At this
stage of the same Miss Hotchki3S
braced and, played fine tennis. She
evened up the score, but Miss Ratcliffe
won the next two games and the set.
In the second set Miss Ratcliffe
played the game of her life, beating
her opponent a love set. The score
was 7-5. 6-0. In the semi-finals Miss
Ratcliffe (owe 15 3-6) beat Miss Lulu
We?;ener^<10), 6-2. 7-5.
On the 1 California CJub courts the
Lowell High School team beat the
representatives of Manzanita School,
Palo Alto. Lowell won all three
matches, two singles and the doubles.
Herbert Lonrr. Lowell's first man In
singles, completely outclassed Henry
Nickell. Manzanita's best player. The
score- was 6-2. 6-1. Abe Hellman.
Lowell's second man. had a much
harder time beatins Harold Stewart.
The score was 6-2. 5-7. S-6. The
doubles were interesting, but were
won by Lowell in straight sets.
PLAYERS FAIL, TO APPEAR.
Local Tennis Experts Unable to Take
Part In IÂ£ust Oakland Matches.
Owing to the fact that many of the
local players were unable to cross the
bay yesterday afternoon only a. few
matches were played on the East Oak
land courts. In the preliminary
round of the singles tourney seven
matt-lies were, run off. while in the
first round there were but four. All
of the players from this side of the
bay are expected to be at the courts
before 10 o'clock in the morning to
p<ay their, preliminary matches. Most
of the matches were rather one-sided,
as none of the good player3 drew to
gether.
The only surprise was the defeat of
Hamilton Murdock at the hands of
H. Palmer. Murdock won his first
match easily and was expected to beat
Palmer/ but the latter won 9-7, 6-0.
Murdock lost heart after the first set
and the second one was a runaway
affair.
The following matches were played:
Preliminary round â Gorrill beat
Webster 6-4. 4-C, 6-3: C. Gardner
beat McDuffle 6-4. 6-4; It. Variel beat
Lowell 6-0. 6-2; C. Griffin beat Ames
6-1, 6-1; H. Murdock beat Millwain
6-2. 6-4; Palmer beat Talcbtt by de
fault; N. Baker beat Sherrard 6-1,
6-1:
First round â Palmer beat Murdock
9-7. 6-0; Biddle beat Foster 6-2. 3-6,
6-3; Medcraft beat Porter 6-4, 3-6,
S-6: Cook beat Francis 6-4, 7-5.
Thu matches to-day will be much
closer and more interesting:. As much
as possible of both singles and dou-
bles tournaments will be finished to
day. A large crowd of locaL enthus
iasts will go over .to Oakland to-day
and encourage their- clubmates. The
matches played yesterday weeded out
tome of the poorer players and those
played this morning" will have the
tame result. Some great tennis is
exnected in the afternoon.

Team bv Score -of 5 to 3
COLLEGE BOYS HIT HARD
Every M.in on Blue and Gold
Liiic-l-p, With Two Excep
tions, Lands on Ball Safely
BERKELEY. Feb. 20.7 â California's
varsity, nine played and won the lirst
preliminary game on the university
campus this afternoon. Without try
ing hard the team rubbed defeat Into
the hides of nin*Â» men from the Oak
land Elks V> the tune of 5 to 3. . On
the surface it looked as if the Elks'
nine, v/ith its profeslonals^ might give
the college men weight for age and
then beat them, but it was just the
other way. The collegians had their
mitts out for any kind of a ball all
the time and when it came to stick
work they usually bombarded with
the accuracy of a Japanese cruiser.
For the first time' up they played well
together and the showing put hope
into the hearts of a lot who thought
the varsity wouldn't have a chance
lh!s year^ '
The varsity not only got more runs,
but more hJts and less errors than
their professional and seml-profes
sionar brethren on the other side. For
some reason the fates weren't kind to
Heitmullcr and Bliss, the heaviest hit
ters on the team, who were the only
men who did not hit safely. Every
body cjj^ got one or two hits.
The game demonstrated that the
team will have to practice a little* in
the base running department. When
it came to posing between t>ass the
men seemed as bewildered as hares in
a coursin? park. In the second in
ning the three outs were administered
while the men were trying to do some
Inexplicable thing in hostile territory.
In abont every other inning somebody
was caught sleeping afthe post.
Heitmuller pitched a steady game

OUR MILITARY POLICY
OFFICIALLY SET FORTH
War Department Publishes the Writ
ings of General Upton,
Strate;:i">t.
The War Department has just pub
lished a remarkably book entitled 'â¢Mili
tary Policy of the United States," by
the late Major General Emory Upton.
General Upton's military career, ac
cording to Secretary Root, who direct
ed this publication, was one of excep
tional excellence and brilliancy. There
fore no one was more fit than he to un
dertake such a difficult task as the
writing of this work. He had riot only
the widtst experience in the field dur
ing tho JJivil War., but he had perfect
genius for organization and tactics.
These attjRnments he supplemented by
a -personal tour of Europe to observe
the workings of the military systems
of that continent, one of the results of
â which was the revolution of the mili
tary-tactics of the United States army:
Although written a quarter of a cen
tury ago, this particular work on'mili-
tary policy was never published by the
Government, and Secretary Root res
cued "it from the millions of documents
in the archives of the War Department

the most brilliant gatherings of the
reason. Wendte Hall was . crowded
â¢with Oakland's elite and praises of
the splendid exhibit were heard on all
fide?. The display is not quite so
large as on former . occasions, but
the quality has been improved and the
general tone is up to a high stand
ard.
An unusual feature this year is the
large number of canvases by non-pro
fessionals. Mrs. A. S. Larkey. a so
ciety woman of Oakland, is exhibiting
two very clever little water-color
sketches. Miss Augusta Zabel has
three really excellent pieces and Mi^s
Jessie Willard's sketches of Chinese
children and a portrait study of a child
were much complimented. Miss Stella
Trask. Miss Margaret Herrick and Miss
Lillian Adams are also local artists and
are showing some delightful work.
Mrs. D. W. Gelwicks has only one
ricture this year, a reminiscent bit in
Mater-color of the San Gabriel Valley.
During the evening a fine pro
gramme of music. was rendered by
Mrs. Carrie Brown Dexter, Lowell
Kedfield and the Orpheus Club quar
tet. Mrs. Dexter was In especially
good voice to-night, her numbers being
' Midsummer Night's Dream," by
d'Hardelot. and "Who'll Buy My Lav
ender ?'* by German. Mr. Redffeld
sang two of Metcalf's compositions,
"A Xame*' and "At Nightfall.".
Much of the credit of the fine dis
play this year is due to the excellent
judgment and indefatigable work of
Mr?. William Mil wain, â  chairman of
the committee of arrangements. i

ADJUTANT GENERAL LAUCK
ADDRESSES "OLD GUARD"
Members of Company A, of Which Governor Pardee Was
Once 'Captain,' Gather at Their Annual Reunion and
Cheer Speeches Recounting Glories of Organization
OAKLANI), Feb. 20.â General J. B.
Lauck, the newly appointed adjutant
general of the National Guard of Cali
fornia, addressed the members of the
"Old Guard" and the. members of Com
pany A. .N. G. C, at the annual re
union and banquet held to-night at
Armory Hall.
Governor George C. Pardee, who filled
successively every office in old Com
pany A, was also expected to be pres
ent, but was unable to "attend. He sent
the following telegram in explanation
of his failure to appear:
"General J. B. Lauck, Armory of
Company A, Twelfth and Franklin
streets: I am'afraid to venture out. I
am with them in spirit and congratulate
them on their adjutant general.
"GEORGE C. PARDEE."
Captain. A. W. Burrell, retiring com
mander of the "Old Guard," delivered
a short: address, introducing "Adjutant
Generui Lauck, who proposed the
health "of the absent commander in
chief. Governor Pardee. after which he
told the history of the service of the
chief executive of the State in the Na
tional Guard, from 'his enlistment as
a -drummer boy in the old Oakland
guard to his present position as com
mar.der in chief. He said:
Governor Pardee Is eminently fitted for his
present position a? head of the National Guard
of California, for hp- has jtrved ln^'every office
from corporal to ca,ptulri In his company and
to on through the - offices on the general's
staff, and It Is well known that no man In
capable of assuming command until lie has
learned well how to obey. It is the wish of
(Jovernor Pardee t* sÂ»Â« .the .National Uuard
of this State brought tn the hlghext. possible
state of efficiency, and we, as menibers'flf the
"Old Guard." should endeavor tp build up. the
"Young Guard."
AT HEAD OF LIST.
Where does California stand to-day in rela
tion to her National Guard? At the head of
the list. And the people of this State, Instead
of ridiculing its members as "tin soldiers' \ as
they cee them pans en the streets, should Irnri
every aid In their power to make the' organ
ization perfect, fur In time of trouble or riot
who are the first to be called upon? At times
when military protection . is neeesefcry for the
lives and property of the r^'Tl'f the chief ex
ecutive of the Etate i* asked tl call out the
National Guard, and we have the material In
this Etate to make the finest National Guard
in the United States. And there In another
reason why the organization should be made
perfect. None of us can tell where the trouble
in the Far East will end. and It Is possible
that before the end comes this country may
be involved. Through the Golden .Gate, went
the first regiment of soldiers that j ever left
the United Etatev for fcrelgn service, and who
knows when It may be necessary for the Presi
dent to once more call for volunteers,- and the
first men to be called out will be the members
of the National Guard. . ." ,.- â¢ . '
General Lauck then announced that
his first official* visit as adjutant gen
eral would be paid 1 to Company A on
Thursday, March 3.

touching. She made daily visits to the
jail, giving what comfort she could to
her life partner. The wife stoutly main
tains her husband's innocence. Her de

won friends for her, and it is through
their efforts she will be able to Â£O to
Kew York. When informed of this fact
this morning by Chief of Police Hodg
kihs her face lighted up with the first
smile of happiness since her husband's
arrest, v_
Detectivc Brown says Wheaton was
considered among the very best ac
countants of New York.

LABORER STRUCK
BY TWO TRAINS
Charles Ilasselkns Used as a
Shuttlecock Between Rail
road Cars at the Depot
AR3I AND LEG BROKEN
Steps Off of Freight, Is Hit
by Locomotive, Hurled Back
and Dashed to the Ground
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. Feb. 20.
Charles Hasselkus, a laborer, was
struck by the 9 o'clock Berkeley local
at Sixteenth-street depot this evening
while dismounting from a freight train,
and was hurled back with great force
against a boxcar and severely Injured.
His right arm was broken below the
elbow and both bones of his right leg
were broken just below the knee. In
striking the ground the unfortunate
man's nose was almost torn from his
face, and his scalp was lacerated in
several places.
Hasselkus had ridden to Sixteenth
street on the freight train, but from
what point he was not able to tell, and,
as the train began to slow up to allow
the Berkeley local to pass, he got off
on the side toward the track on which
the Berkeley train was approaching
and, not v noticing the coming train,
stepped directly in front of the locomo
tive, which struck him on the right
side, hurling him back against the
freight train, injuring him' as stated.
Hasselkus is 2G years of age and is a
native of Rockford, Ohio.
dumping criminals
int*o the * united states
Police or EuropÂ« Systematically Rid
ding Tftcmselvcs or Undesirable
Characters.
Now, all of this goes to- prove one of
the most important facts in connection
with Italian emigration; that the ques
tor of each district is slowly and effect
ually clearing the district of its crimi
nal class by dumping the lot into North
and South America, the most danger
ous coming to the United States as the
best field for their future operations.
Here is the syllogism:
Since American police records and
prison statistics, especially those of the
United States secret service, show large
and increasing 1 - numbers of Italian
criminals In this country. %
And since the mass of these can en
ter only 'by immigration.
And since the emigrant must have a
passport from the chief of v his local
police district.
And since even' criminal's record is
kept In the- district in -which he was
born, and he must so there to get the
brrth certificate, on which he gets 'his
passport. â  . â¢ '-
Then these thousands of passports
issued annually to criminals are given
by Chiefs of Police who know the rec
ords of the men wher are receiving
them and are thu3 deliberately rid
ding their districts of them to save
themselves trouble and Increase their
reputation for efficiency.
That those secret instructions which
are issued from Rome to the chief of
each district advise any such procedure
I do not believe. They do advise, so I
have b^en reliably informed, that pass
ports be not issued to prostitutes easy
of detection or to persons over 45, In
asmuch as both classes are very nearly
sure to be turned back and to become
a matter of expense to the Government.
That is th<Â» bugatoo cf Italian st.-tts

A CHARACTER FACTORY'
OF XEW ENGLAND
â¢ There is a school in Springfield,
Muss., whose business it is to train
young men and women of foreign
birth or parentage for intelligent
American citizenship. If is a small
school and feeble, whose slogan is not
chanted by throngs of friends on ath
letic fields or at alumni banquets,
whose name is unknown outside of the
little round of its immediate activity.
But to every American of the old stock
who holds his country dear the
French-American college must be an
object of interest. It is an effort to
develop a force which shall help to
save New England to herself, to pre
serve the old type of civilization now
so vigorously threatened by the con
stantly rising tide of immigration.
The lack of work for the students is
a serious matter. For this is a poor
man's college, and most of the stu
dents work out a considerable part of
their expenses. The boys, take care of
the buildings and grounds and the
girls work in the women's hall, help
about the cooking, and serve in. the
dining-room. There is a printing of
fice which furnishes most of the work
for the young men. The college pub
lishes the French-American Citizen, a
pixteen-page weekly paper on which
the students do all the w : ork except the
printing, for they have no press.
Every boys learns the" printer's" trade.
A schedule is made out each week and
posted on the bulletin* board showing
the amount of type each 'must set. â¢
There is a regular form 1 of contract
which each. student signs at; entrance.
It sets forth just what his" expenses
will be for the year (the average 1 13
less than $130). and "he states the
amount he is prepared to pay in cash.
The rest he pays in manual lahor and
the college frankly declares that inas
much as labor is, not worth so much to
it ; as money, he will be required to
work 20 per cent more than he is
charged in cash. â Collier's Weekly.
Want Leap >Ycar Hights.
The girls of Minnesota find that their
leap year privileges are not what they
should be. and have called upon Gov
ernor Van Sant through a letter writ
ten by. one of their members appointed
as a committee of one asking that the
Governor proclaim their leap year
rights in order that the young men of
the State may be brought to a realiza
tion'of their duties during leap year.
The Governor will not make known .the
name and olace of residence of.his t cor
respondent, but [admits that the letter
comes from a prominent young woman
of one of the large, cities of . the - State.
The young women would have it, the
Governor says, that the young men
must accept if the ladles propose to
them.,. "The": Governor is* seriously con

CANNIBAL KING BANGASSON,
RULER IN DARKEST AFRICA
Holds Sway Over 200,000 Subjects, Who- Vary Farming
* With Slave Raids, Miintain a Fetish Free in Their Chief
Village and Eat AH Criminals Whom They Execute
BY WILLIAM . STAMPS CHERRY.
-â >"â . . .
[African Traveler. Explorer ajid Hunter of Big Gam*.]
(Copyright. 1004, by Joseph B. Bowles.) .
(Copyright. 1001, by Joseph B. Bowles.) '
Foremost In the list of equatorial Af
rican chiefs stands Bangassou, King
of the N'Sacklaw nation. ' I heard of
him long before I met him and was
anxious to see him. My experience
with him was somewhat extensive and
varied. He is a big, fat negro, with'
more than the usual measure of native
shrewdness and capacity for govern-*
ment. H^ holds absolute sway over
a territory as large as the State of Illi
nois. His people, although brave war
riors, are agricultural, and live in scat
tered villages, supporting themselves
by cultivating corn, sorgo, semsam and
all manner of tropical products. Their
number is variously estimated from
about 50,000 to 200,000. - .
As I approached Bangassou's village
1 was met by a delegation froiÂ» the
great % chief, which escorted me with
honors into his Majesty's presence. He
wanted to see the gun with which I
had killed the elephants. Some won
derful tales had been told him regard
ing my hunting exploits. Those tales
had not .lost anything by their frequent
repetition. When I arrived the whole
village came eut to see the new won
der. Bangassou was seated surrounded
by his warriors and advisers. He wel
comed ma with a hearty handshake,
looked me over critically, and then said,
with charming frankness, that he did
not beMeve one-half of what he had
heard about me. I -explained to him
that everything I had done lay, in the
superiority of my weapons and knowl
edge where to shout the elephant. He
examined my guns, went over my
whole outfit with as much curiosity
as a child, and by the time I got
through answering his questions he was
a friend and admirer.
Bangassou has everything on a big
scale. His village is occupied exclu
sively by himself and his wives, and no
one is allowed to enter the royal in
closure except by' his permission. It
is difficult to find out exactly how many
wives he has. I have' heard the num
ber stated variously at from S00 to 3000;
probably 1000 would be near the mark.
-I know that I got lost in his village,
and it certainly had the look of a very
prosperous place. The houses did not
differ in appearance from those of his
Subjects, only being somewhat larger,
and the King's habits of life are any
thing but refined. He is served exclu
sively by his wives: one fetches his
pipe, another his chair, another sup
ports the bowl of his pipe in her hand,
and all the others clan their hands
when he smokes or eats; they also
make. a feeble effort to applaud when
his highness coughs or sneezes.
According Jo the usages of native
hospitality, Bangassou got up a big
powwow in my honor. The people
gathered in an open square decked in
paint and ornaments. In the center
was a group of twenty-seven women
colored all over with camwood, making
them look as red as lobsters. At a
sign from BangasEou three big wooden
drums began to beat. Then the women
who were seated on stools clapped their
hands, keeping time with the drums,
and swaying their bodies in oriental
style in perfect unison with the music.
Then two men came into the circle,
each carrying a girl of about 6 years,
with mats over their heads. Throwing
aside the mats, that served the purpose
of curtains at a theater, thexshow be
gan. The hair of the girls was strung
with beads, giving them the appearance
of Egyptian dancing girls. On their
ankles were tinkling bells and around
their necks were chains and trink
ets. In their hands were buffalo tails,
which they shook at the men. who.
catching them by the knees with the
feet under their arms, held them In a
horizontal position, while they twisted
themselves into fantastic shapes, keep
ing time to the music with their heads
and arms.
After the girls got out of the arms
of the men they commenced to dance
alone, which they did with perfect
grace, the women, who were seated on
the stools, watching them critically and
snatching them from the circle if they
made the slightest mistake. During
the performance 1 was seated by Ban
gassou in the midst of his numerous
wives/ At one time, when he had left
his ulace to chase away with a club
the crowd that was pressing In from
"every side, one of his wives asked me
to get up out of her light, as I hap
pened to be sitting in the line of her
vision. "When Bangassou returned he
was told of her rudeness, and she was
sent away in disgrace. During the per
formance I was always wondering
what was coming next.
Here at Bangassou executions are
common, and new skulls are being con
stantly added to the fetish tree. The
fetish tree is near the common place
of meeting, and around It are depos
ited the skulls of the. criminals killed
and eaten. Bangassou does not try to
conceal the fact that his men eat hu
man flesh. The most common capital
offense is adultery, and the most fre
quent offenders are Bangassou's wives.
Their recent contact with French black
soldiers has made them victims of the
most loathsome of diseases. Already
the N'Sacklaws are a tainted race, and
are paying very dear for their contact
with our modern civilization.
Later <-n I happened to be at his vil
lage at- the time when Bangassou re
turned from a successful slave raid in
the country of the Boobos. ;I counted
800 captives, and a lot they
were. Bangassou told me that I had
seen only a small part of his captives.
This extensive slave raid went on under
the very noses of the French military
officers. Almost all these slaves were
sold to the Arab traders, who 'carried
away the women to fill their harems.
Since his alliance with the French
Bangassou \tk.s been developing along
modern lines. He Is .laying his plans
for future conquests. For a time we
were good friends, but he cast a cove
tous eye upon my guns, and tried to
compass my ruin that he might gain
possession of them. He has got nujne
rous guns in exchange for slaves taken
in r battle, and " Is learning how to use
them. It is also said that he is foment
ing: dissatisfaction with the French
Ucrvcrnment among the neighboring
tribes, his ultimate purpose being to
drive the white intruders out of the
country. : ,
Mbally, the eldest son of Bangassou,
will be the ruler of the N'Sacklaws
when the < old chief; dies. He is ten 1
times more of a savage. than his'father.
Like his father, he Is big, fat and much
married. Hft has soft, dreamy eyes, arid
is much beloved by the female portion
of the population. He is easily influ
enced for good or evil/ He does not
take Jife very seriously, and will riaver
have the Caesarlike quaftties of his old
father. He spends his life drinking togro
and sleeping off its effects. His god' is
his belly. - Every time I met him he
squeezed my. hand, while j he .. embar
rassed me by his protestations of ad
miration for ' my- generosity, â¢ which
meant that I was to give him a;hand
some present. His first- present, was al
ways a g"argolet of. togo, accompanied
by a vile smelling compound composed
of the flesh of everything in the animal,
kingdom, from an elephant to a 'rat,
which \ tasted good if "eateti without
asking questions. He was very much
surprised that I had no wives, and ex
pressed his readiness to supply the de
ficiency. Jsingle'blessednesswas some
thing he could not understand.
Mbally wished to impress me .with
his greatness. He , assembled" all -his
warriors, decked out in the most gor
geous array. 1 was led past a' great
heap of human 'skulls, some of them
bc-ng of recent acquisition; and the
odor was terrible. Many of them bore
marks of fire, and the hole at the ar
ticulation, in. the vertebra had been en
larged to give access to the most dainty
dish known to the N'Slicklaivs. By a
fine economy oC means the skull serves,
both as a pot to cook in and as n dish
to eut from. One part of the entertain
ment gotten up for. my- special benefit
consisted* of a one-legged man and an
old deformed dwarf â  dancing -to the
music of the tom-toms. It was a ludi
crous performance! Following -that
came a sham battle, a wild, blood
curdling affair.
The braves went through the motions
of killing their enemies. - They, came
down toward. me with a wild charge,
brandishing their spears as if they
would instantly annihilate me. -I. was
anything but at ease, but pretended to'
be unconcerned. ' Mbally was watching
me like a hawk with the tail of his eye.
He expected â¢ me to be overwhelmed
with this display of power and 'glory.
My men, who sat near me. were suit
ably impressed with the imposing spec
tacle; their eyes 'bulged out of their
heads, and thev shook with ' fear. ' I
had seen this game of bluff, before and
was prepared for it. Mbally was ex
asperated when he saw how coolly,. I
took It. He turned upon me" "angrily
and asked why I. had come to his vil
lage. He' said that he did not want me
there and that he hated the white men.
I told him that I Just happened to be
passing by on my way to Ratto, his
rivatiand enemy/- Tht* touched him to
the "culck. H6 -then threatened me
with harm.' I told him I could take

volver. I nut a" few holes In a bungo
tree, the bark of which is used for the
making of cloth. This gave things a
new turn;' he began to" quarrel about
the tree, but he soon cooled down, and
the game of bluff was over and- we be
came the stant'hest of friends. The
chair upon which I sat during the per
formance was a hippo's head.
I entered into negotiations , .with
Mbally for the skulls of the Boobos
killed in the last raid. I offered him
three guns for them. For some super
stitious reason he at first did not want
to part with them, but the offer
was tempting and he took it. I was
preparing to put mv somewhat grew
some purchase Into baskets and trans
port them down the Hver In " caqoes,
when he backed out,, saying that they
were "yorra"â that Is, medicineâ and
that if he gave them he and his father
would die. It.. was no use to argue with
him on this point, so my graveyard re
moval scheme- had to be given-up. -."--

CYPROMENE HAS A NARROW
ESCAPE FROM DESTRUCTION
The British ship Cypromene, Cap
tain Patterson, forty-three days from
Salina Cruz, in ballast, had a narrow
escape from . destruction early yester
day morning" on Mile Rock. The story
of (he vessel's danger and of her res
cue by the tug Relief v.'as told in yes
terday's Call. The vessel's identity
ivas not learned until several hour3
after this paper had gone to press.
The Cypromene, favored by a flood
tide and light westerly wind, sailed in
through the Heads shortly after mid
night and had the breeze remained
constant would have reached an
anchorage in the quarantine grounds
with little trouble. The wind . died
down, however, and the Cypromene
was left to the mercy of the rushing
tide. The anchor was let go. but found
no holding place and the ship drifted
In the darkness toward Mile Rock, one
of the few menaces to navigation re
maining in- the harbor. Fortune fa
vored the windjammer and as she was
swept by the jagged peak all went
clear but her rudder, which struck the
rock lijjhtly. Distress signals were
burned and , rockets fired, but before
assistance arrived a light wind sprang
up, and, slipping the anchor and forty
five fathoms of chain, the Cypromene
got under way and sailed clear of the
danger.
The tug Relief, which responded to
the signals, took hold of the Cypro
mene about 1:20 a. m. and towed her
to'an anchorage. The life saving sta
tion sent. a boat to the vessel, but for
tunately the life savers' assistance was
not required.

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Feb. 20.â Tha wheat market
opened excited and strong. Shorts were
) active bidders for the May option and initial
I quotations on that delivery were- unchanged
j to l%c higher at $1 02% to $1 04. July opened
j %c higher at 93Â®93%c. The advance was
i due mainly to the strong cables, Liverpool
futures being up a penny. Paris ?iSlc and
Antwerp lv*c a bushel. The gain at Antwerp
was , taken to be especially significant a-s
caused by threatened stoppage of â¢ shipments
from -Argentina and Russia. . A report , t-tated
that railroad employes In- Argentina were on
the verge of a strike. The transportation , of
troops and war munitions In Russia is greatly
restricting the movement of , wheat In that
country. In addition to â  the bullich foreign
situation â  conditions in the United States were
ruch as to cause alarm as to 'the suf
ficiency of the domestic "supply. The -.de
mand from fhorta was met promptly by cell
ing orders for the account of the leading long.
Small holders also had wheat for eale. -Alter
touching $1 04 May quickly dropped to $1 02%,
while July declined to 92%c For a short time
the market held comparatively steady around
theee llgures. â¢ As soon as the 'selling stopped,
however, prices again moved upward under ur
gent buying by shorts. The fact that the
board would be closed on Monday, Washing
ton's birthday, appeared to. me materially ef
fective in bringing out the heavy buying or
ders, traders being loth to remain short over
the two days' recess. Late In the session there
was practically no May wheat on the market
and shorts were bidding V'Â»c to %c over the
market price in order to get It. The high
point was reached at $1 07, .a gain of 4%c
I over last night'a close. The demand for July
I was almost as good as wae that for May,
I but there was more of the deferred future for
j sale and the advance was not as sensational.
1 The price for that delivery rose to 9Cc, or 3%c
I above yesterday's close. Realizing sales fe-
I suited in May UecJining to $1 05%, while July
j fell back to 94%c. Another rally followed the
last few minutes of trading. May closing at
$1 03Â»i and the July at Â»5%c. - Clearances
of wheat and flour were equal to 350.000 bush
els. Primary receipts were 475,000 bushels.
May corn opened unchanged to %c higher at
C<j%c to 5tfUc, but declined gradually to 55% c.
May later advanced to 67%c. Although profit
taking carried the price, down from the high
point, the close was strong at 56*,i@57c. July
showed a gain of closing at 55c, after
ranK'.ng between 54%c and 55%@55%c
J There was an active trade In oats, with the
' best demand coming from shorts. After open
ing unchanged to V4c higher, at 45% to 45%c,
May sold between 45%c and 46'ic. closing at
45%ci July wa* up l%c at the close. Final
figures were at 41'Jic. '.
The provision â¢ market was active and strong
throughout the entire day. Buying by pack
ers and outsiders, together with covering by
Fhorts, were the factors that resulted In gains
throughout the whole list. .May pork closed

WHEATâ The. foreign markets continued
strong' and futures were' sharply higher.
Chicago Jumped from 92%c to 06c and closed
at 65%c. Houses with foreign connections
were very good buyers of July.
The Chicago wires of Mitchell, Mulcahy , &
Co. said: "Another active market, with prices
at close 2 to 3 cents higher. Foreign market*
wfre'agaJh sharply up. " There, was during the
first hour or ,so enough scattered profit-taking
to ho|<7 the market about steady, but later, on
the Mjmjational characters! the political news.
It advanced- -sharply. : It . -did not hold all the
advance. Market has had a , big advance. and
there is a large scattered long Interest, which
will make It vulnerable to anything In the way
of.new* that la unfavorable to prices. At the
fame, time the awakening of interest in Euro
pean markets. on account of the war and the
curtailment., of Russian shipments haa tended
to place the market In, a less, artificial position
than heretofore, although prices here are still.
In the. main, out' of line: for present business."
This market was . sharply higher In futures,
sympathetic' with Chicago, May rising 2%c and
December 4c. The cash grain, however, was
not as firm as on the preceding day, as the
rapid advance has caused buyers to hold off.
There la no pressure ! to sell, however, and
quotations show no further change.

market, with : May l%c and December l%c
higher. As previously mentioned, the advance
In futures Is â  mainly due to â¢ the attempt of
large holders to market the'r holdings and take
their profits. - In addition the advance in Wheat
has had 4ta natural effect, while some shorts

â  Poultry and Game.
There was continued firmness in airdejcrlp- :
tions of live Poultry and the market was bare
at the. close. -Receipts were 32. coops, some
thing unusual for a Saturday. A car of West
ern Is scheduled for to-morrow's market, r but
It will not be marketed before Tuesday. Dress
ed Turkeys ruled weak at previous prices,
fancy stock only being wanted. Receipts were
53. cases and there was quite a quantity of
poor ' stock carried over . from the . preceding
day^- ..-Poor and "gfassy" stock, which . formed
& large percentage "of the supplies, wa* hard
to pell, even at the minimum quotation.' â

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The week dosed without much change in
quotations, Everything was In liberal supply
', and more or less weak, and close buyÂ«rs could
obtain concessions in' all three of the -descrip
tions in the above head. The steamer for the
< Sound took out between 930 and 1000 'cases of
Eggs. : which was a material help to the market.
There was some disposition to shade the quota
tions for lower grade Eggs, as the small outside
receivers were offering their lots to suburban
restaurants at very bottom prices and thus cut
ting Into the regular trade. The ruling quota
tions were 25c for creamery Butter and 24c for
ranch Eggs, though the general range was as
quoted. . The Cheese market continued de
preystd. '.
Receipts were 37,900 lbs Butter, 1044 cases

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
There was a little, more activity in the
, Orange market, as local retailers were buying
for two rtays' requirements, and there. was a
fair inquiry' for shipment to near-by towns,
but there was no possibility of an advance in
prices, as all dealers were carrying heavy lines.
anJ stocks on tfie way to this' market wer<>
reported large. The demand continued to be
crnflned chiefly to the large, sizes of Navels,
that Is, '.k;Â» ar.d 112s, but stocks of those sizes
were mort plentiful than previously, and ex
cept for occasional lots of extra fancy the top
quotation was considered extreme. All other
citrus 'fruits. Mexican Limes execpted, were
dull and featureless. To-morrow will be &
legcl holiday, but all of the fruit houses will
b..' open in the fcrenoon and the auction sale
of Orange*, will be held at the usual time.
Six or si-vf-n cars are announced for the auc

Apples were unchanged, with supplies of all
grades- well up to requirements.

M Miss Rose Hennessy, well known as m
a poetess and elocutionist, of Lexington,
Ky., tells how she was cured of uterine
inflammation and ovaritis by the use of
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
" J>FAn Mk?. TrKEHAM : â I bare been so blessedly helped through the us*
of Lydia 1Â« Pinkham's Vegetable Compound that I feel it but just to
â¢.cknovrj^jre it. hoping that it may help some other woman bufferinsr as I did. [
" Tor years I enjoyed the best of health and thought that I wonld always i
do eo. I attended parties and receptions thinly clad, and would be suddenly
chilled. b::t I did not think of the results. I caught a bad cojd eighteen
months ago while menstruating, and this caused inflammation of the womb
â  nd congested ovaries. I suffered excruciating pains and kept getting worse.
My attention Tvas called to your Vegetable Compound and the wonderful
cures it had performed, and I made up my mind to trv it for two months and
Â«ee -n-hat it would do for me. Within one month t f,elt much better, and
â¢t the close of the second I was eDtireiy well. 'â¢
â¢â¢ I have advised a number of my lady friends to use it, and all express
themselves as well satisfied with the results as I was." â Mies Rose Noxa.
Hexne?sy, 410 S. Broad wav, Lexington. Ky.
The experience and testimony of some of the most noted
tvomm of America gro to prove beyond a question that Lydia E.
Pin!iliam*s Vegetable Compound will correct all such trouble and
at once, by removing the cause, ami restoring the organs to Â»
normal and healthy condition.
u Dear Mr.Â«. Pinkham : â About tvro. years ago I consulted a phy-
sician about juy health which had become so wretched that I was no
longer able to be about. I had severe backache, bearing-down pains,
pains across the abdomen, was very nervous and irritable, ana this
trouble grew worse each month. The physician prescribed for me, but
1 soon dlsLOveind that he was unable to help me, and I then decided to
try Lydia E. Pinkhara's Vegetable Compound; and soon found that
it was doing me good. My appetite was returning, the pains disappear-
ing, and the general benefits were well marked.
** You cannot realize how pleased I was, and after taking the medi-
cine for only three months. I found that I was completely cured of my
trouble, and have been well and hearty ever since, and no more fear thd
monthly period, a.? it now passes without pain to me. Yours very truly,
Miss Pearl Ackers, 327 North Summer St., Xashxille, Tenn."
When a medicine has been successful in restoring to health
more than a million women, you cannot well say without trying: it
â¢*l do not believe it will help me." If you are ill, do not hesitate
to get a bottle of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound and
write Mrs. Pinkham at Lynn, Mass.. for special advice. Her ad-
vice is free and helpful. Write to-day. Delay may be fatal.

The potash which is dug from the
royal Prussian mines, located at
Strassfurt, ninety miles from Berlin, i3
the sole source of the world's supply.
Before the mines Were discovered the
best substitute which could ,be found
for the product- was wood ash, such
as 1 the Southern plantations used in the
old days in. making lye soap. The
Prussian mines are twenty-seven in
number and were devoted to the pro
duction of salt before rock salt Was
discovered. : , , :
When the new variety of salt was
given to the world about forty years
ago the Prussian mines ' were tem
porarily abandoned and in; a few years
.1 search for rock salt was instituted.
The salt was found, but in a badly
adulterated condition and : an' analysis
of the adulterant revealed the fact that
it was the most valuable part; of the
mineral. The potash was at once turn
ed to use as commercial fertilizer, and
establishments in \Loulsville take a
large proportion of the production. It
is an ; ingredient- of -the material in
which th"e Tennessee and South' Caro
line phosphate is -largely used. /;<Â£ V

Various Matters of News
Concerning Citizen Soldiery
There were, exciting times la the
headquarters of the Seventh Regiment,
N". G. C, at Los Angeles recently, when
the regimental officers met to elect a
successor to ColonelJohh R. Berry, who
had held the colonelcy since December,
1S95. He was a candidate for re-elec
tion, and" thought his only opponent
was Lieutenant Colonel W. G. Schreib
er, who had for a- long time aspired to
lead. the Seventh. Schrciber was the
only avowed candidate, but when the
first ballot was taken it was discovered
that Major Henderson H. . Finley .of
Santa Ana had received the votes of
the officers of the three companies of
his battalion. The vote stood . 15 for
Schreiber, 13 for Berry and 9 for Fin
lcy. The vote was the same for twenty
three â  ballots, except that occasionally
one would change his vote to either
Berry or Finley. This was on a Satur
day night, and after the twenty-four; *Â»,
ballot Lieutenant Colonel A. W. Brad
bury, who presided, announced that in
a few' moments it would be Sunday
morning and that an election held on
Sunday would not be legal. One of the
officers' asked that one more ballot be
taken, feeling sure that,, the result
could be announced before midnight.
Another ballot was granted, and the
result was that the Schreiber force with
one exception went over to Finley, and
he was declared elected. An objection
was raised on the ground that â¢ the
watch showed that it was just after
midnight when the result was an
nounced, but the presiding office? over
ruled the objection, as his watch
showed that it was not quite 12 o'clock.
Colonel Berry then moved that the elec
tion be declared unanimous, and the
motion prevailing Major Finley became
the colonel of the Seventh. By this
election the headquarters will be re
moved from Los Angeles to Santa Ana.
During the evening Captain Walter
A.' Greenleaf was elected major, vice
Finley, promoted; Major Terrlll Thom
as, inspector of rifle practice on the
staff of Brigadier General Robert Wan
kowski, was elected major of the sec
ond battalion over Captain Harvey E.
Higbey, defeating him by a vote of 23
to 14; Captain L. H. Cole was elected
major of the first battalion without op
position.
Major Shadworth O. Beasley, who
served in the t Philippines as surgeon
in the United States infantry and in
the "Eleventh United States Cavalry,
has been appointed inspector of rifle
practice for the First Artillery, N. G. C.
Last week there. was a school of in
struction for the non-coms, of the First
Artillery, the instructor being Major
Bush, commanding the battalion. They
were instructed in much that apper
tains to their ordinary duties and in
engineering duties.
At! an. election held in Company F,
Oakland, last week Major George H.
Wethern of the Second Brigade staff
was elected captain, which position he
held In 1893.* J. P. Jobansen was elected
first lieutenant, and the election of sec
ond lieutenant was deferred.
The First Artillery battalion will
have a practice day at the guns at the
Presidio on the 28th of the current
month. It will be a day of hard work
for the men of the First, but they are
willing to be instructed.
At' a meeting of Company A, First
Infantry, First Lieutenant Bertrand
presiding, resolutions .were adopted ex
pressing sympathy "tvith Captain George
T. Ballinger because of the accusation
of embezzlement preferred against him,
expressing belief in his innocence and
pledging undivided confidence and sup

SOCIAL SENSATION
AT ST. FETERSB URG
Czar's New Secretary of State Black
balled at the Local English
Club.
An extraordinary "sensation has been
created at St. Petersburg by the
blackballing at the English Club there
of the Czar's new Secretary of State,
M. Besobrazoffr who has been credited
for a year past with being the Em
peror's* most trusted adviser and most
intimate friend and who is regarded
not only at St. Petersburg but also at
Berlin, at Vienna and at Paris as one
of the most influential factors in Rus
sia's domestic and foreign policy of
the last six months. . â 
Denounced by his many foes as a
court favorite, more' powerful than
any'other since the days, of the favor
ites of .the Russian monarch of the
eighteenth century, praised, on the
other hand, by. his friends, who in
clude several members of the reigning
house, as a most .enlightened man.
who ha3 been prompted by disinter
ested motives to place his services and
his wealth at the' disposal of his sov
ereign, ho first came to the fore when
he quitted th - Chevalier Gardes regi
ment, in wl;i 'â¢"â¢! he held a commission,
ln'order to t; .c part in the organisa
tion of that species of volun
teer secret police known as- / the
'\yoly Band," formed for the purpose
of specially protecting the imperial
family against the nihilists, meeting
the latter with their own weapons and
fighting them '_ both at â¢- home and
abroad by, means of a secret; corps of
police composed of the flower of the
Muscovite aristocracy.
M. Bezobrazoff was proposed i for
membership at the English club ' by
M. Abaza and seconded by- the Minis
ter of the Interior, M. de Plehve. After
Bezobrazoff had been blackballed
once a second ballot was taken, which
resulted in; an Increased ' number of
blackballs. Abaza; and Plehve. con
struing" this not only as an affront to
themselves 'but as an act, of opposi
tion to the Czar, have resigned their
membership of. the club, which, founded
by an" English merchant ' named
Gardener in 1770. is now the most ex
clusive club in- Russia, restricted to the
cream >of: the. aristocracy; and. to the
highest dignitaries of the ; realm, the
only. Englishmen belonglng.to.it being
King Ed ward and 'the British' Embas
sador, .who" are honorary : members. - It
is curious that it should â¢ have' retained
its name in spite of the hostility with
which; England has "been regarded " in

New York's Financial Position.
. The New Tork banks are lending
594,000,000 more money to-day than they
were a year ago, while their . deposits
are $92,000,000 higher and cash held is
$29,000,000 greater. The New York
banks have cut down circulation in the
past two weeks by over $1,000,000. De
posits are $13,000,000 above the highest
on record; loans also broke all records
and are $44,000,000 higher than last
February. In ten . months the New
Tork banks have increased their de
posits by $171,000,000, and $176,000,000
has been recovered in the last six
weeks. â 
The enormous dealings of the New
York banks amaze all the financial
centers, says the Boston . Journal, and
indicate that all financial roads now
lead to New York. Money continues
easy. There is little speculation. The
Iron trade remains quiet. Rail makers
will not sell at the price at which users
of rails are ready to buy. There is an
ticipation of a decided improvement in
business at the opening of spring and
a hopeful feeling prevails.
The recent expansion of loans
amounting to over $100,000,000 is due to
large corporate borrowing as well ,as
to investments In sterling and commis
sion house time loans. The money
which has been pouring into New lork
of late is surplus circulation which has
gone out to move the crops and come
back again.â New York Commercial.

Mouthpiece in 3Ian*s Tongue.
With the amber mouthpiece of a pipÂ«.
nearly an inch and a half longr, im
bedded in his tongue for over nine
weeks, and suffering no inconvenience
whatever, Joseph Lefkey of New York
consulted Dr. C. W. Graham concern
ing a "slight" bruise on his tongue the
other day, when the stem, nearly three
eighths of an inch in diameter, waa
found imbedded in the center of the
thick part of the tongue, far back in
the mouth and completely hidden from
sight.
â  Only a slisht puncture, about the size
of a pinhead, could be seen by the phy
sician on the first examination, and so
bewildered was the patient when the
long stem was finally removed and
shown to him that his first exclama
tion was: "Look around in there. Doc;
I lost the pipe, and maybe the whole
thing is laying around in there some
where."
Two months ago Lefky -was returning'
to his home from the West Allls shops
and was smoking his pipe while on the
rear platform of a car, when a sudden
lurch threw him from h!a feet and ha
plunged head foremost to the ground.
He was bruised, but soon got tc his
feet 'and spend several minutes looking
for his pipe, which he had lost.
