hope of finding an avenue for grace

There Is no argument over the right of
Russia to seize neutral vessels carrying
actual contraband of war, but the wis
dom of destroying neutral prizes with r
out trial, unless the object is to involve
other powers, is generally questioned.

became the bride of Dr. John Reynolds,
a prominent physician of Shepherds
town. Her former lover also in the
course of time took unto himself a life
partner in a distant part of the State.
It was not until many yearns after
ward that the two came together again,
one as a widower and the other as a
widow. The old spark rekindled Into a
flame, with the result that there will
be the notable wedding at the quaint
old town of Shepherd3town some time
during the month of October, so the
gossips say.
Mrs. Reynolds is remarkably well
preserved, and for a half-century or
more has been the social leader of Shep
herdstown. She Is the mother of two
grown children and the grandmother
of a half-dozen interesting boys and
girls. She lives in a beautiful, old-fash
ioned house within a stone's throw of
the stately Potomac, and many distin
guished men and women have enjoyed
her hospitality.
The friendship thus begun speedily
ripened into love. Davis proposed and
the young woman was willing, but her
parents could not resign themselves to
the idea of their beautiful and accom

LONDON, July 26. â Cabling under date of July 24y the Daily Mail's Newchwang correspondent describes a l^hour desperate battle,
with heavy losses on both sides, and which resulted in the Eussian position at Tatchekiao being rendered untenable, by reason of which they
will be compelled to retreat toward Haicheng. "The battle began at 6 o'clock in the morning," the correspondent says, "the Eussians resum
ing the attack on the Japanese position on the height east of Tatchekiao. After a few hours the Japanese left flank from Taping Mountain
captured the village of Tanghuditueno, compelling the Eussians to retreat to Tienghuaituen, six miles from their base; The Eussians, now
reinforced, maintained the position until 5 o'clock in the afternoon, when the J%anese right flank made a sudden appearance on the hills
south of Tatchekiao and by a tremendous fire forced the Eussians to retreat. The Japanese firing line extended fifteen miles. After two more
hours of an incessant storm of shot and shell, they swept the last hill and the plain clear of Eussians."

SINKING OF KNIGHT COMMANDER
Captain and Crew Are Taken Aboard
One of the Russian Cruisers.
. YOKOHAMA, July 25. â Captain
Brown of the steamship Tsinan, which
brought the crew of the steamship
Knight Commander into port to-day,
says that the Knight Commander met
three Russian warships 7:30 o'clock
on Saturday morning off the province
of Izu. The Russian officers who
boarded the Knight Commander took
her captain back with them and or
dered the crew of the Knight Com
mander to come on board one of the
Russian warships within ten minutes.
The Russians then sank the Knight
Commander.
â¢At 3 o'clock in the afternoon the
Russian vessels met the Tsinan and
transferred the crew of the Knight
Commander to this vessel.
An Indian boatswain of the Knight
Commander says the- Russians boasted
that between sinking the Knight
Comrtiander and halting the Tsinan
they sank two small "Japanese vessels'
and that, before meeting the Knight
Commander, they had captured a Ger
man steamship, believed to be the
Arabia, belonging to the Hamburg-
American line, and the Cheltenham, a
British vessel. The Russians claimed
to have plenty of coal.
Before leaving the- Tslnam Captain
Brown was ordered to blotv^ff steam
and not to move his vessel until the
Russians .had disappeared beyond :the
horizon. . "When last.seentat- 7 o'clock
in the evening the Russian warships
were steaming in a' southeasterly di
rection toward the mouth of Tokio
Bay.
The American Trading Company,"
agents here for the Knight Command
er, deny that the vessel had any con
traband on board, according to her
manifest.
The three Russian warships which
sank the Knight Commander" are re
ported by Captain" Brown of the Tsl
nan to have been crowded with men.
Their bottoms are foul and they look
grim and ugly. The Russian vessels
are believed to be short of prize crews.
The Tsinan brought In a number of
passengers, including women and
children, from Australia.
Americans here are quite anxious
concerning the possible fate of the
Korea, belonging to the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company, and the Amer
ican steamship Shawmut, which left
Puget Sound pn July 16 for Hong
kong. The agent here of the Pacific
Mail Company cabled <a warning to
the Korea at Midway Island. It is not
known whether either of these steam
ships carries contraband.
The sinking of the Knight Com
mander without a trial is considered
here to be art act of savagery and as
affording ground for apprehension as
to the treatment by the Russians of
other neutral vessels.
KNIGHT COMMANDER'S CARGO.
One Consignment Left at 3Ianil a Be
fore the Steamship's Seizure.
NEW YORK. July 25.-The steam
ship Knight Commander sailed from
New York on May 6 with a large cargo
for the Orient. Much of the cargo was
consigned to Singapore, Manila and
Shanghai, but she also carried mer
chandise, machinery and other articles
for Japanese ports. All but the Japan
ese consignments had been discharged.
Although It was impossible to secure
a copy of the manifest, showing the
steamship's entire cargo, It ,was learn
ed that the Japanese consignment in
cluded 750 steel plates. 400 steel rails
and quantities of ironwork for railroad
bridge construction. The machinery
was consigned to an electrical concern
In Kobe.
At the local offices of the steamship
company It was said that the Rus
sians, upon overhauling the" Knight
Commander, evidently considered her
cargo, or at least a portion of It, as
contraband and seized her with the in
tention of taking her to a Russian port.
Then, finding her too slow ' to Â¦ accom
pany their fleet, they decided to de
stroy her.
The Knight Commander ,was valued
at about $105,000 and the value of her
cargo is estimated at $120,000. She was
owned by Greenshlelds & Co. of Liver
pool.

BERLIN, July 25.â According to. a
dispatch to the Lokal Anzeiger from
Toklo the German steamship Arabia,
captured by the Vladivostok squadron;
had on board a cargo of 3000 tons of
flour. The dispatch confirms the re
ports that the Arabia and an unnamed
British steamship have been sent as
prizes to Vladivostok.. The. Arabia, is
a Hamburg-American Line steamship.
She was recently chartered for; service
ok the Pacific coast of America.
Dealing with other features of the
question, Balfour said he did not be
lieve that the removal of a portion of
the cargo of the seized ships at the dis
cretion of the daptain of a warship
without the adjudication of a prize
court was sanctioned by the practices
of international law.
"The dISlcultles arising from these
captures deal with a problem whicbj
has given and is .still giving the Gov
ernment great anxiety, but of which I
may say the signs portend a favorable
issue. More than that I think it would
be inexpedient to say."
"With reference to the question
whether the Government was bound,
under the Suez canal treaty, to allow
a British vessel taken as a prize to pass
through the canal against the will of
the owners, the Premier says:
"No act of war, so far as I am aware,
has been committed in the Suez canal,
and the convention expressly provides
that a prize shall be treated as a man
of-war, and men-of-war are to have
free right of passage. Therefore, I do
not think any particular difficulty
attaches to that branch of .the ques
tion or gives rise to a difficult subject
for controversy between the two pow
ers. I think there can be no doubt that
we are bound to allow a prize of war
to traverse the canaL"

ST. PETERSBURG. July 23â The
popular version of the Red Sea en
tanglement which has so embarrassed
the Russian Foreign Office is that ft
grew out of Grand Duke Alexander,
Mikhalovich. head of the Department
of Mercantile Marine, practically tak
ing matters into his own hands and
commissioning the vessels of the
volunteer fleet, which had passed
through the Dardanelles bound for the
Far East, to hoist the Russian war flag
and seize merchantmen in the Red
Fea. It is understood that the Em
peror has censured his brother-in-law
for taking a step of such gravity with
out consulting the Foreign Office.
There is general relief, however, at
the fact that the Grand Duke Alex
ander Mikhalovich's precipitate action
has not resulted in irreparable com
plications. The blunder of the Grand
Duke is attributed to his youth and in
experience in affairs of state. He is
veil known in the United States, as
he was first staff officer on board the
armored cruiser Dmitri Donskol on the
occasion of the visit of the Russian
squadron to Hampton Roads and New

OrdÂ«*rs Sriznne of Merchantmen on
As some surprise has been expressed
at the reports of the sinKJng by Rus-
Eian cruisers of defenseless merchant
Ehlps, instead of taking them into port,
it may be stated tbat the general naval
opinion IÂ»;re Justifies that course, In
the event that the Russian warships,
es Is suspected, have not enough men
abcard to furnish prize crews to con
duct the captured ships to their near
eÂ«t prize port. This is a desperate
course, and, according to the naval
view here, is full of risk for the Rus
sians, who mtost be prepared to pay In
full and in cash for any maritime prop
erty belonging to the citizen of a neu
tral power able to demonstrate that his
goods were not contraband and that
fcis ship was not subject to seizure
ur.der the rules of a prize court.
GRAM) DUKE TO BLAME.
The application was taken at once by
Acting Secretary Oliver to the State
Department, but la view of the Intend
ed release of the Ardova it la improb
able that any action will be taken by
the department.
The case of the Knight Commander
Is regarded here as complicated and
difficult of treatment, altscugh a more
complete statement of facts is expected
to simplify the problem. It is appre
hended that if the contention of the
Bhip's agents that the cargo contained
co contraband is correct the general
doctrine of "neutral flap covers neutraJ
poods'" has been violated by tho de
struction of the ship and cargo.
As for the Knight Commander hcr
telf. the State Department probably

Bia growing out of her sinking.

on board a large quantity of supplies

inc about 2S0 tons of powder and much
ether matter that would fall within the
Russian definition of contraband: The
stores were being shipped through the

ENGAGEMENT WITH BRITISH
ARMY OFFICER IS BROKEN"
TACHEKIAO, July 25.â The opin
ion of Major General Kondra
both south and east are weakly held,
but strongly fortified, and that much
of the Japanese Infantry has been
drawn off to reinforce General Kuro
kl, who is' operating against-Lieuten
ant General Count Keller. At some
positions south of Simoucheng dum
mies are actually being used to main
tain entrenchments.
The Russians are so surrounded by
entrenchments to the south and east
that it is hard for them to move with
out coming under flre. There is ap
parently more artillery than infantry
In these positions.
The Japanese are loth to disclose the
locations of their guns. A few days
ago General Baron Stakelberg and his
staff personally reconnoltered the po
sition at Makuntsuidzl Hill without
drawing the Japanese flre, though the
party were conspicuous in their white
uniforms.
The Russians are harassing the Jap
anese posts almost nightly, their Bcouts
creeping up and firing at close range.
The Japanese never attempt to follow
the attackers.

DUMMIES MAN TRENCHES.
LONDON, July 26.â War news In the
newspapers this morning is scant, but
all reports indicate that the Russians
have suffered 1 a serious check in the
vicinity of Tatcheklao.
The Daily-Telegraph's Liaoyang cor
respondent, telegraphing on Sunday, re
ports that" Tatcheklao was definitely
evacuated Rafter. a ; severe engagement,
which was*- In tended, to retard a Japan
ese flank movement on Liaoyang,' but
this dispatch does not give the place of
the battle'or the, date.
The correspondent, at Tientsin of the
Standard reports 'Incessant fighting
since Thursday: around Tatcheklao and
Kalchoii, in r which the Japanese/were
steadily forcing the/ Russians back.
The dispatch from Liaoyang to', a
news agency . here < reporting heavy
fighting there, all of . Sunday, it would
appear, refers/ to this battle and from
this and other reports ..it. seemsthat
some 30,000 Russians were engaged" and
that the battle, -'to a great extent, was
an artillery duel, no ! mention being
made of a cavalry charge, although
the ground is fairly open and level. '
TIENTSIN, July .25. â Information
has been ' received here to the 5 effect
that the 'Japanese have not entered
Newchwang. The Russian civil ad
ministration-departed last night (Sun
day) arid the"; destruction . of Russian
Government property began this morn
ing, at the Instance of the administra
tion. The fighting reported yesterday
took place between . Newchwang and
Tatchekiao, and Japanese â¢ troops from
Kaichou were engaged. No engage
ment has taken place at Tatcheklao.
MUKDEN, July 25.â The nearest Jap
anese outposts have shown no change
for several days past, and there are no
signs that they contemplate advancing.
New branch societies of the Boxers
are appearing among the Chinese,
under the titles of "Paguatuank" and

REPLIES TO PACIFIC MAIL.
State Department Notifies Company of
Its Rights on the High Seas.
WASHINGTON, July 25.â The
week's Investigation by the State De
partment of -the problems connected
with the operations of belligerent ships
against neutral merchant marine has
crystallized in a letter addressed to the
Pacific MaiUSteamship Company. The
company recently . wrote to the de
partment, expressing apprehension for
the safety of the big steamship Shaw
mut with her cargo of food supplies
intended for Japan and of other ves
sels of the line about to follow .with
general cargoes, and asked as to the
company's rights and exemptions and
liabilities- on the high seas and within
the war zone in the Far East.
The department, does.,: not deem it
opportune to make th,e* reply public,
but it is understood to be based upon
expressions delivered in preceding ad
ministrations of the State Department,
which, in substance, warned shippers
against the .carriage of contraband
and of violation of port rules imposed
by belligerents in a position to enforce
them. ' . . '
The position of the department will
be speedfly and publicly developed,
not academically, but in connection
with the first protest which is lodged
with the department against the ac
tion cf one of the belligerents toward
an American ship or an American
cargo.
ARABIA A PORTLAND VESSEL.
Steamship Seized Was Under Charter
to a Harriman Company.
PORTLAND, Or., July 25. â The
Portland and Asiatic liner Arabia,
seized by the Russian Vladivostok
fleet, sailed from this port for the
Orient "on the night of July 1, carry-
Ing about 5000 tons of freight, valued
at 5187,087. Her cargo included 33,
726 barrels of flour, most of which
was consigned to Hongkong mer
chants, with smaller shipments to
Kobe and Nagasaki. Next to the ship
ments of .flour the most important item
In the steamship's ( xnanifest was a
large shipment of material used 'in
the construction of railway cars con
signed to Kobe and Yokohama.
' The vessel was not protected from
war risk and but a Blight portion of
her cargo was insured against war
risk, owing to what was .then deemed
an exorbitant rate â Vi per cent being
asked.
The ' Portland and Asiatic Company
Is in reality a branch of the business
of the Oregon Railroad and Naviga
tion Company, which Is controlled by
the Harriman railway, interests. That
company has received no news of the
capture of the Arabia.' It is believed
at the general office of the Oregon
Railroad . and Navigation Company
that the Arabia was seized because of
her shipment of railroad materials.
BRIDGE WORK ON. BOARD.
Probable Reason for the Sinking of
the Knight Commander.
LONDON, July 25. â It is pointed
out in shipping circles .at Liverpool
that because of Russia's contention
that Tailroad material Is contraband
of; war, the presence of bridge work
for the Japanese among- the cargo ac
counts for the sinking of the British'
steamship Knight Commander. Her
crew numbered siity-elght, including
natives. She was Insured against war
risks.
There Is practically no excitement
here over the sinking 6f the Knight
Commander, the Russian action having
been taken by a regular, warship and
wlthin'the zone of hostilities. The bit
ter criticism evokedover the action cf
the vessels of the Russian volunteer
.fleet and the passage of Â¦ the Dar
danelles is more or less disarmed. The
Foreign Office for the moment takes it
as merely another strong argument in
favor of an international conference
relative to contraband.

A large tract of land at Debruce
has been purchased, upon which has

Angora goats. The owner has now
gone to New Mexico in quest of 2000
goats from that State and proposes
to cross the breeds, expecting to pro
duce a superior species. Several large
landowners of Sullivan County are
watching the experiment with Interest
and if it results successfully immense
tracts probably will be devoted to the

ITHACA. N. Y., July 25.â The lives
of many persons out sailing on Cayuga
Lake were put in jeopardy yesterday
by the sudden development of -an enor
mous waterspout. Without warning a
whirling mass of water at least 150
feet in diameter and reaching up to
the clouds started from the shore of
the lake Just north of this city and
with remarkable rapidity traveled
more than a mile across the surface
of the water toward the west.
The mass was shaped like an hour
glass and was partially enveloped In
spray. The surface of the water over
which it passed was churned into a
foam. Fortunately no boats happened
to be in the path of the spout.

HARLEM. Mont.. July 25.â Xews
reached here to-day of a shooting af
fray at Rocky Point, in the Bad Lands
of the Missouri River, last Friday in
which three men. all Indians, were
killed. Several cowboys were wounded,
one fatally.
The trouble is said to have been
started by a half-breed named Brown.
Brown and several Indians were on
their way to the Crow reservation and
stopped for a time at Rocky Point.
There they began drinking and playing
poker with some cowboys. A disagree
ment ensued and this led to the use of
weapons. When the smoke cleared
away it was found that Brown. Aloy
sius Chandler and an Arapahoe Indian
were dead, their bodies being literally
filled with bullets.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HONOLULU, July 19.â Eugene Mc-
Phetridge, a clerk in the office of the
quartermaster of the United States
army here, was arrested by United
States Marshal Hendry on the charge
of having smuggled into the United
States 3250 cigars. It was agreed that
the prisoner should be allowed to go on
bonds of $2300, and he is booked for
appearance '' In the Commissioner's
court on July 22.
The United States officials concerned
in the case are observing a remarkable
secrecy about the whole affair and It Is
rumored that the arrest of McPhetridge
is only the beginning of disclosures of
irregularities of a sensational nature.
The cigars that McPhetridge is said
to have smuggled are understood to
have come from the United States army
transport Sherman and not from the
Thomas, the last transport here.
McPhetridge, who has been In the
employ of the army department for
some years, has always borne an ex
cellent character. He is a married man
of middle age, living with his wife at
14SS Nuuanu avenue. Mrs. McPhet
ridge is at present visiting in Cali
fornia. He was appointed to the de
partment from San Francisco.

Colonel R. M. Green of Oroville took
an important part in the meeting of
Union and Confederate veterans held
here to arrange for a great national re
union of the blue and the gray at
Washington next May. He was ap
pointed a member of the committee
that is to notify Generals Lee and
Black, commanders, respectively, of the
Confederate and Union organizations,
of the desire to hold the reunion.
, Among the prominent visitors to the
exposition is Colonel A./B. Butler of
Fresno and San Francisco, who was
always a leading raisin packer and
who was credited recently with making
a sale of oil lands at a figure beyond a
million. He now has 12,000 acres of oil
land in the Indian Territory and has
come here from Europe, where he left
his family, on his way to the Territory.
He spent five months there last year.
Judge Wills and his associates in the
Sacramento Development Association
display entertained 100 young ladies the
other day, who were sent to the fair by
a Cincinnati newspaper. They came
from Ohio and surrounding States.
Each was given a package of Califor
nia nuts and dried fruits and some of
the literature of the Sacramento Val
ley.
Charles H. Spear, chairman of the
State Harbor Commission, is here with
his wife and daughter. Spear saw the
unpacking and placing in position at
the San Francisco building of the sec
tion of a modern wooden cylinder pier
sent here by the Harbor Board. This
is an excellent municipal exhibitâ one
of the best and most interesting in the
building. The outer sixty feet of a pier
100 feet in width is shown on a scale
of one-half inch to the foot.
TO BETTER FERRY BUILDING.
Spear will return home armed with
facts through which he hopes to make
Wells, Fargo & Co.'s Express erect a
building of its own on the water front
and stop using the space now occupied
by it in the ferry building. He has
made inquiry in several large Eastern
cities and finds, he says, that no ex
press company is given such a privilege
In any of them.
George A. Dennlson is here In the
employ of the State Board of Trade and
the California commission. He talks to
visitors on the floor of the building
afternoons and assumes the duties of
secretary In the forenoon. Commis
sioner Fllcher is very anxious that
Dennison be made secretary perma
nently, but it is likely that some good
Republican who is capable and who
helped make Pardee Governorâ and
there are plenty eligibleâ will be given
the billet. The statute creating the
commission provides that a secretary
shall be appointed at a salary of $200
a month and expenses. . The Commis
sioners are anxious to get some one of
their own choosing into the pjace at
less than half the salary fixed by the
legislative act. It is rumored that
their zeal to save the State money is
so great that they are going to donate
half their "own salaries to the State at
the close of the fair. Neither of them
will confirm this, and it is probably
only a rumor..
CONFEDERATE VETERANS.
Through the efforts of the United
States Government a colony of Japa
nese silk growers is to be established
near the city of Saji Diego, and this
will give the industry a good start
there.
to stimulate production, offers $1 for
every cocoon sr>un in America, and has
taken an especial interest in the San
Diego article. It is said that the San
Diego worms produce even a better silk
than those of China and Japan because
of the equability of the climate. The
worms ,Â»re affected by every unusually
warm or cold spell and also by feeding
on wet leaves, so every radical change
in the thermometer and too much rain
injures the quality of the silk produced.
Eight-inch mulberry slips planted in
March in San Diego will produce leaves
in June big enough for the worms to
feed on.
"With the San Diego silk material was
a magnified cocoon, showing the miller
into which the worm turns after spin
ning, in the act of escaping from its
delicately constructed castle to mingle
with others of its kind and produce
more worms to go through the same
process and produce more cocoons. This
monster cocoon is five feet long and
more than a foot and a half thick, and
the miller escaping from It Is as big as
an eagle. If the real cocoon were as
large as this the silk would have to be
wrested from its Inhabitant by a Sher
iffs posse.
HOPE TO DEVELOP INDUSTRY.
Silk is not produced now in commer
cial quantities In San Diego, but the
residents there hope to make Its pro
duction a prominent industry In time.
In many yards in the city of San Diego*
silkworms are kept as a matter of
amusement, and one woman has made
money for years by selling cocoons and
Bilk ornaments as souvenirs, but the in
dustry up to 4 this time has made no
great headway there.
Now the Government has taken an
Interest in It' and much is expected
from this aid by San Diego. Uncle Sam.
The final shipment of material for
the California exhibits, with the ex
ception of fresh fruits, which will con
tinue to arrive throughout the sea
son, has reached here. In it were sev
eral cases of processed fruit to add to
Alameda County's display in the Hor
ticultural building, three cases of
stuffed birds, fish and animals, which
constitute the Sacramento exhibit in
the Forestry, Fish and Game building,
where Los Angeles has been the only
California county represented up to
this time: an additional silk exhibit
for San Diego County and eight cases
of minerals and photographs for the
mining display. Among the minerals
was some fine gold ore for the Nevada
exhibit.
Los Angeles has learned about all
there is worth learning in regard to
exposition display. Two items are
prominent in this fund of knowledge:
It pays to make a first-class exhibit
and pays to have it ready on opening
day. ,
The representatives of some of the
other counties have written home ad
vising as to the removal of their dis
plays to Portland when this exposi
tion closes. Unfortunately, politics
sometimes Is a stronger force in the
selection of exposition representatives
than public weal and some of the men
who have gained valuable knowledge
here may have to give way to others
who never saw an exposition, but have
a "drag."
HAS LEARNED LESSON*.
Los Angeles County, with its accus
tomed advertising enterprise, has al
ready decided to send its beautiful ex
hibit here to the Lewis and Clark
exposition at Portland, Ore. The Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce is tak
ing the preliminary steps, toward se
curing space and transporting the en
tire display.
Los Angeles knows the advantages
of placing her charms before the world,
and when the Portland fair is opened
the first visitor to pass through the
gates will see the chief county below
the Tehachapl ready for inspection. The
results of this promptness always prac
ticed by Los Angeles are all that the
visitors see her display and all go away
feeling that the people are awake and
up-to-date.

Health, before the summer school in

"Estimating the value of a single life
at $1500. and taking only those lives be
tween 16 and 45 years," said Dr. Dar
lington, "the loss of life in this city
alone from tuberculosis mounts up to
the startling sum of $23,000,000 annu
ally.
"The death rate here is much lower
than in large European cities, which
shows what has been accomplished by
the spread of clinics, and of preventive
measures, of better housing conditions,
of the warfare against dark interior
rooms and unsanitary plumbing, which
has gone forward here during the last
few years.
"The death rate will not go much
lower with us unless we take even
more radical steps. It is "a question
simply of educating the people and of
general sanitary conditions."

The committee was to have investi

of J. G.Â° Smjthe that the cost of the

Â«'ommissloners were present, although
they had been notified to attend the
meeting. Commissioner Parry was
also to have reported on the fire de

failure of the Commissioners to com

Elevator Inspector Holman was giv
en until next Monday to file his re

< v.mmis!>lcners. and the bidder to whom the
contract was awarded for shoeing the horses
of the Fire Department, that demands pre
wnted to this board for such work will not

In the matter of the award of contract re
ceOOj aÂ»ardt-<l by the Kire Commissioners for
shoeing the horses of the Kire Department:
Your committee- believes this work should
h* done by the city and not given to private
I*>rs<ns for lirofit. It has not been shown to
ycur committee that this work has been ln
a<1<vjumrly done by the city in the pant.
The Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors yesterday presented a
report to the board at its meeting
strongly disapproving of the action of
the Fire Commissioners in awarding
a contract to Edward Graney for shoe
ing the horses of the Fire Department
at $2.50 each, when the work has been
heretofore performed by day labor for
$1 TTVs. Expert Cvril Williams was
directed to examine the books of the
Fire Department for the purpose of
ascertaining the exact amount which
it costs to fhoe the horses when the
work is done by the city. The report
of the committee follows:
. On behalf of insane widow of
Henry Voprman a suit was begun yes
terday in the Superior Court which
may involve the distribution of his
$600,000 estate or may be only a pro
ceeding to quiet title to the property
which falls to his seven heirs. \ John
R. Altken was appointed guardian of
Mrs. Mary A. Voorman, and his ap
pointment and the suit were filed to-'
gether. The 'fact that Mrs. Voorman
owned valuable property before she
became Voorman's wife.^ind that an
adjustment of the rights and titles haa
never been had, affords speculation as
to the purpose of the latest proceeding
in the case. Annie Laura Voorman
and the six other heirs are named as
defendants. .
Since 1875 Mrs. Voorman has" been
in the insane asylum at Stockton. The
contentions of her guardian, probably
made in the interests of some of her
lawful heirs, will have a significant
bearing upon the distribution of the
estate.. It is alleged that when Voor
man married his wife in 1858, she was
the owner of the property at the cor
ner of Jackson street and Sullivan al
ley. He acted as her agent and made
no accounting.
It Is averred that on June 24,- 1S6&,
he had $21,000 in his possession that
belonged to 'his'- wife, and with ft pur
chased from W. F. Swasey a property
at Bush and Mason streets. He took
the conveyance in his own name and
in his last will he did not specifically
devise- this property to the heirs, who
are made defendants in the present
suit.
It is further alleged that in January,
1877, Voorman held $30,000 collected in
rents from his wife's property and con
verted by him to his own use and that
in January, "1883, in "consideration " of
the rents so collected, he sold the Bush
and Mason streets property to his in
sane wife. It is asked that the court
declare that he held the title to the
property in trust for her and that her
title thereto be declared complete.

Both sides seem to have centered
upon this town as the chief battle place
of the county. There will be ninety
three delegates in the convention, this
place furnishing seventeen. The Ox
narders expect to come across the river
from the towns of Oxnard, El Rio and
Hueneme with enough votes to control,
providing they can carry this town, so
their every energy will be bent upon
getting the Ventura delegation.
There are whispers of money on both
sides heard on the streets. The Bard
leader in the county, W. L. Lewis, says
that Bard will get every delegate in
this town and most of the country del
egates, conceding Oxnard no full dele
gation anywhere excepting in the town
of Oxnard. where there is no Bard tick
et. The Bard people say that they will
by two-thirds control t,he convention,
which will take place next Saturday.

best judges in this county is that Sen
ator Bard will carry it by a substan

At the matinee" to be given . by the
students of the, Paul Gerson School of
Acting at the Alcazar Theater this af
ternoon two 'one-act plays new to this
city j will be given". The first, "The
Prairie' Judgment," was written by
Martin V. Merle, . the young Santa
Clara College student who staged the
Passion play last . season., at "Santa
Clara, and which . critics declared was
a wonderful representation. It Is Mr.
Merle's first attempt at play writing
and if the r public takes kindly to his
first offering he intends to undertake
something on a, more ambitious scale.
Another one-act play Is by Sudernian
and Is a story of German military
life entitled ' "Frltzchen." It is crowd
ed with intense situations and is writ
ten inthe great author's best vein. - A
pretty little one-act Southern play,
which has not been seen in this city
for years, is "Marse Van."

opening of a week of pleasure and.
mirth. The carnival this year is held
under the auspices of the Women's

Tivoli.
"Robin Hood," with Its splendid ag
gregation of singers and comedians,
began its sixth and last week at the
Tivoli last night. An enthusiastic audi
ence was present and recalls were the
order of the evening.
Fischer's.
"A Lucky Stone," at Fischer's, en
tered its third week last night. The
usual big houses throughout the week
are confidently expected.
Alcazar.
"Rupert of. Hentzau" was produced
last night by the Alcazar stock- com
pany, but hardly with the success that
attended its predecessor, "The Pris
oner of Zenda," of which it Is the sequel.
It lacks the thrilling climaxes and
clever lines of the latter piece, although
the capable members of the' company
struggled In valiant fashion with what
material they had to work on. White
Whittlesey was not at his best in the
dual role, of Rassendyll and King Ru
dolph, the quick changes from one
character to another being the clever
est thing about the impersonations.
Whittlesey was not letter perfect in
his lines/ a defect shared by several
of - the company. All' this will be
remedied now "that the players are
familiar with the situations, and a
smoother, performance will undoubtedly
be" the result to-night. There is much
to interest in the piece and great praise
is certainly due to the efforts of Fred
Butler,' Luke Conness, who plays pie
title role; Richard Vivian, Stanley
Johns, Harry Byers, Marie Howe and
Oza Waldrop for their painstaking ef
forts. 'Juliet Crosby acted the part of
the Queen with her usual -charm and
Intelligence.
Chutes.
"Mike," Foster's dog, a diminutive
canine that does about everything but
talk, gave his Initial bark at the
Chutes yesterday and made a great hit
at both performances. Derenda and
Green, agile and amusing club jug
glers, and John J. Scully and- Blanche
Phelps, who presented a comedy skit
entitled "The Irish Author," were also
new and won the approbation of their
audience. Belle and Lotta Tobln, the
Instrumentalists; Emma Cotrely and
Antonio Van Gof re, the strong couple:
Hershal Stein, the barytone singer of
illustrated songs, and the animato
scope, showing many Interesting
scenes on board of Japanese men of
war, completed a capital programme.
The amateurs will appear on Thurs
day night.

INSANE MAN BITES.â Louis Salinas, an
Insane patient cenflned In the Detention Hospi
tal for the Insane at the City Hall, made a
desperate and almost successful attempt to es
cape last evening. He bit the steward, who
prevented htm accomplishing: his purpose.
Salinas has been in Â» the hospital for several
day9 suffering: from a mental disorder that
was manifested by an inordinate craving; for
milk. 'He was not regarded as particularly
dangerous and therefore was not strapped to
his -cot. Steward Mandvllle In making: his
rounds went to the room occupied by Salinas.
As he opened, the door the demented man
sprang on him and sank his teeth deeply into
Mandvllle's neck. Salinas fought his way
toward the door. Â¦ The arrival of other attend
ants and two officers prevented the crazy
man ! escaping or shedding more blood. He
was placed In a. straltjacket and will be sent
v to an asylum to-day.
Central.
* Scott . Marble's highly sensational
dr^ma, "The Gates of Justice," crowd
ed the Central Theater last night and
pleased the house with Its succession of
thrilling incidents. - The climax brought
great applause and a half-dozen cur
tain;.calls. This scene; Illustrates an
attempt to murder the superintendent
of a mine by hurling him down a chute
leading to the coal crusherâ a tremen
dous machine with large cylinders pro
vided with huge teeth. To fall into
these metallic jaws means instant
destruction. sThe audience is roused to
the; highest ""enthusiasm by the heroism
of a girl who saves the Intended victim
from a frightful fate In the , nick of
time. Herschel Mayall and Eugenie
Thais. Lawton do excellent work in the
heroic roles.
The play served to introduce the Cen

SACRAMENTO, July 25.â Rufus P.
Jennings and J. E. Faris of the ex
ecutive committee of the , River Im
provement and Drainage Association
appeared before the auditing board of
the State Commission of Public Works
this afternoon and recommended the
employment of the following consult
ing engineers to devise a compre
hensive plan for Improving the Sacra
mento and San Joaquin rivers: Major
T. G. Dabney, Clarksville, Miss.; H.
M. Chittenden, Sioux City, la.; Henry
Brown Richardson, chief engineer of
the State of Louisiana, New Orleans.!
Jennings explained that the recom
mendation was made In accordance
with a resolution adopted at the river
convention in San Francisco in May of
the present year. The auditing board
passed a resolution approving the
selection and fixing the compensation
at $1000 per month for each engineer
during the period of his service, which,
it Is expected, will be five months. "It
developed that rjot more than half of
the engineers in the United States who
were written to responded.
Governor Pardee, prior to his depart
ure for St. Louis, approved the em
ployment of three engineers residing
outside the State at an expense not to
exceed $15,000 to be paid by the State.
The three engineers will be supple
mented , by two engineers selected in
this State, who will doubtless be Major
W. H. Heuer. the Government engineer
in charge of the! California rivers, and
M. A. Nurse, engineer to the Commis
sion of Public Works. The engineers
will be requested to report plans "in
time to permit appropriation bills to be
prepared for presentation at the-. next
session of the Legislature. The en
gineers will be expected to provide
plans for caring for the annual flood
waters and improving navigation on
the two great waterways. -, I

took his accustomed sea<%by the win

could to bring him to life, but it was
In vain. On searching his pockets
she discovered an empty bottle that
had contained carbolic acid. This ex

WASHINGTON. July 25.â Despite the
fact that Congress passed a measure
authorizing the President to restore
Lieutenant Richard H. Townley. re
tired, to the active list of the navy, the
department has decided to take no ac
tion in the matter because of the scan
dul in which the lieutenant became In
volved In the Philippines. This decision
on the part of the department leaves
Lieutenant Townley in his original po
sition on the retired list, though when
tried by court-martial for the Philip
pine scandal he was convicted and sen
tenced to be dismissed from the navy.
Lieutenant Townley was received for
active duty In the navy during; the
Spanish war on his own application,
and was sent to Â¦' Manila for duty In
connection with the purchase of sup
plies for the navy. While so engaged
he became Involved In the scandal In
the office of Major George B. Davis.
commissary.
It is alleged that Lieutenant Townley
suggested to certain contractors having
business with the Government that
they contribute $2000 to make up a
shortage of that amount in Major Da
vis* accounts. Lieutenant Townley
was tried by a court-martial for scan
dalous conduct. Five of the seven mem
bers of the court joined In recommend
ing for clemency on thfe ground that
"the motives governing: the action of
the accused in this matter were be
lieved by them to be due to a mistaken
or quixotic Idea of kindness, and were
free from intent to defraud any one."
The case has been pending before tha
department ever since, and sentence
has never been executed. The decision
of the department, just announced, to
take no further action in this case baa
the effect practically of nullifying: the
act of Congress and also the sentence
of dismissal imposed by the court
martial, and leaves Lieutenant Town
ley In his former status as lieutenant
(junior grade) on the retired list.

KANSAS CITY, July 25. â "The
strike situation looks very bright at
the present time," said C. W. Armour
to-night. "President Donnelly or
dered certain members of the Allied
Trades to strike this morning at 7
o'clock and they refused to do it."
The word ordering out the members
of the Allied Trades Union in this city,
which was expected to come from
Chicago this morning, failed to come
and the men continued at work as
usual. It Is the apparent intention of
the local packing companies to adopt
the "open shop" policy, and they con
tend that they will have won the bat
tle against the unions when they shall
have secured a sufficient number of
non-union men to restore the normal
output of the various plants.
The strikers are strictly preserving
the orders of President Donnelly not
to create any disturbance and the.po
lice report that since the second walk
out they have not rnade a single ar

According to the packers the general
strike to-day was a failure, it being
claimed by them that not more than
one-half the members of the allied
trades quit work when officially called
out by their leaders this morning. The
further statement was made by the
packers that should all the union men
decide,, to join the strikers it wonld

CHICAGO, July 25.â With all peace
negotiations broken off and with all the
allied trade unions employed at the
different plants, with the exception of
the teamsters , and the stationary en
gineers, out on strike in sympathy
with the butcher workmen ' who quit
work two weeks ago, the stockyards
strike to-night had settled down to
what promises to be one of the bitter
est fights between capital and labor in
the history of America.
As had been threatened for some time
the allied trades employed in the pack
ing industry quit work when called
upon to-day to assist the striking
butchers in their efforts to bring the
packers to terms. In several instances
the men did not await for the official
notification from their leaders to go on
strike, but threw down their tools and
quit work of their own volition. At
6 o'clock to-night the statement was
made by Michael Donnelly, president of
the Butchers' Union, that every union
man employed at the stockyards, with
the exception of the teamsters and en
gineers, had responded to orders for
a general sympathetic strike. The en
gineers, he declared, would join the
strikers to-morrow morning, and unless
there were a speedy settlement of the
difficulty, he said, the teamsters would
undoubtedly join their brother work
men in their struggle for supremacy.
According to Donnelly to-day's strike
swelled the number of men who have
quit work at the stock yards in Chi
cago alone to nearly 30,000.

made at the conference and the team
sters' committee retired to consider a

Despite the sympathetic strike to
day all the plants worked up to the
regular time, although at a reduced
capacity. At Armour & Co.'s plant it
was claimed that 1880 hogs, 700 cat
tle and 200 sheep had been slaugh
tered during the day. At the other
six plants a corresponding amount of
work was accomplished and it was
predicted by all that by to-morrow
there would be a decided increase in
the number of animals slaughtered.
test the ground for an indefinite period.
On the other hand, the leaders of â¢ the
laborers assert that all the employes at
the packing plants, together with sev
eral hundred employes at the Union
Stockyards, quit work to-day In
response to the general order for a
sympathetic strike.
A new phase of the strike situation
developed late this afternoon, when
notice was given by the unions to the
Independent packers at the stockyards
that their men would not be allowed to
handle animals which had been
brought into the yards or handled in
any way by non-union men. It Is
necessary for these independent con
cerns to take all of their livestock into
their yards over the Union Stockyards
runways, where stock must be handled
by non-union men, since the union
men employed by the stockyards com
pany in this line of work were among
the employes who joined the sympa
thetic strike to-day. The ultimatum of
the unions leaves . the independent
packers no alternative but to receive
their livestock directly from the
country or else close down business en
tirely. A meeting of the independent
packers was held to-night to map out
some plan of action, but no definite
conclusion was reached. Another meet
ing will be held to-morrow to further
discuss the matter. â¢ .
LAST MOVE TOWARD PEACE.
Before peace negotiations had been
entirely broken off to-day representa
tives of the teamsters' union, as had
been agreed upon last night, were in
conference with packers in efforts to
arrange some sort of agreement which
would prevent the spread of the strike.
At this meeting the packers were
asked to concede that the first peace
agreement signed last Wednesday and
which was later- repudiated by the
strikers, when a second strike was
called, be considered null and void and
that the packers submit a new propo-j
sition for peace terms. The committee
also notified the packers that the
striking butchers would stand by^laet
Saturday's demand, which was that all
men be reinstated within ten days or
their cases be submitted to immediate
arbitration, all butchers and casing
men to be I taken back within forty
eight hours after work wan resumed.
No progress toward a settlement was

there was evidence of ample enjoy

BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Frederick Tiden is the lover and
has the unhappiness,to be a cad of
Mrs., Ryley's making. Mr. Tiden has
to throw carelessly away a letter writ
ten to him by an bid flame of his, in
order that her husband may find it.
But he is unconvincing as a lover,
stagey, unreal. He serves the cast,
however, by wearing some. handsome
uniforms handsomely. John Glen
dinning supports Mr. Miller in able
fashion, as his fiery old friend, Good
lake, and Walter Allen is clever as the
servant Peter.
Both Miss Heyer and Mrs. Fisher
partake of the rather preponderating
staginess in the cast, Miss Heyer as
Goodlake's wife and Mrs. Fisher as
Embury's housekeeper.
Miss Jennie Busley, who has the im
portant part of the ward Peggy, is a
young woman of considerable .charm.
She Is delightfully natural, arch, girl
ish, and is generally a piquant, small
person. I fancy Miss Busley was some
what nervous, .as the greater. freedom
of her later scenes would indicate. Â¦ But
her performance was a very pleasur
able part of the whole. As the found
ling, one of a row of them brought to
Embury's rooms by the beadle and
matron for his choice, Miss Busley is
particularly engaging.
The cast' unquestionably has* some
thing to do with the case. One is un
accustomed to Mr. Miller "in renuncia
tory mood, to begin with. He gener*
ally speaks for himself, John, and all
the Columbia knows how he invariably
conquers. As Mark Embury Mr. Mil
ler steps into the cooler realm of mid
dle age. .Peggy, it is true, persuades
him to momentary forgetfulness of
graying hair and gathering years. But
only for a moment. He finds that his
ward is in love with his nephew, and
like the good, kind, thoughtful middle
aged uncle that he is, he steps aside in
favor of the young chap. Quite a John
Drew part, but not till now Mr. Mil
ler's kind of thing. Perhaps when the
newness has worn off 'twill come eas
ier, but 'tis rather incredible vet to
see the gallant Henry taking such
medicine. Time has, however, not
dulled the actor's love-making.
One wonders at Peggy's choice of the
Impersuasive lover of Mr. Tiden when
the Miller virtuosity is beside it. And
Mr. Miller is in excellent form. He
was welcomed with extravagant felici
tations by the audience, a large one in
spite of rival attractions of sea and
mountain. In his greeting speech Mr.
Miller replied with very genuine feeling.
New York gave a season and London
a year to "Mice and Men," introduced
here at x the Columbia last night by
Henry. Miller. Away from the pleasant
persuasion of Mr. Miller one rather
wonders at the record. Mrs. Ryley's
new comedy does not â as seen last
nightâ tempt to superlatives. Pleasant
enough it is, new enough, clever
enough. Its story is ingenious, its pe
riod picturesque, its people plausible
and well contrasted. Yet, in spite of
pretty scenes by the way, the play runs
somewhat heavily its appointed course.
The expected always happens. There
are effective situations, but one' spies
them round the corner. One knows
from the tirst that Embury's arcadian
plan of educating a wife for* himself â
he is not content with the wives that
mother used to make â must gang agley.
And so on. Yet 'tis a pretty story, cap
able of and deserving of subtler treat
ment.
The thirty-seven companies involved
in the strike operate eighty-one mills
with about three and a quarter million
spindles and a weekly product, when
running in full, of more than 900,000,000
yards of cloth. Practically every one
of the mills was shut down. There was
no disorder.
Both sides admit this is the begin
ning of one of the most determined con
tests which Fall River has ever seen.
The managers maintain they were com
pelled to reduce wages to save their
business, while the operatives say con
ditions affecting cotton manufacture
here did not warrant such a reduction.
FALL RIVER, Mass., July 25.â The
etrike order issued by the' Fall River
Textile Council, calling for upward . of
20,000 operatives to remain away from
the mills to-day . in protest against a
reduction of 12*Â£ per cent in wages, be
came effective to-day and the response
was as general as the labor leaders had
predicted.
CHICAGO, July '25. â Startling facts regarding the meat famine are revealed by a comparison of fig
ures showing the receipts of cattlo at the Chicago yards. Receipt* last week were 14,284; the average
weekly receipts of cattle in 4903 were 66,009; the falling off for the week was 51,725. The figures show

for $93,000. The land and improve
ments cost Davis $25,000. It is set
forth that 3000 acres of the lands are
now under alfalfa cultivation and
worth at .least $75 an acre, and that
b^ large part of the tract is partly
fenced, ditched and leveled.
The administrator declares that it
would be to the best interests of the
estate and those holding 1 interest in
common to have the tract appraised
by strangers to the county, who are
familiar with the value of the prop
erty.

Body Not to Be Sent Home.
OAKLAND, July 25.â Regular Pa
trolman Carl E. Kentz of the' Oakland
Police Department was* off duty last
night. Carl took advanatge of his brief
furlough and attended a moonlight
outing at Shell Mound Park. That is
what led to his undoing.
After a strenuous encounter with the
kind of alcoholic stimulant that hits
the fighting bumps Kentz imagined he
was a composite photograph of every
body in the fighting game from a Ro
man gladiator down to Jeffries.
Resultâ One badly battered bluecoat
borne to the County, Jail at 2 o'clock
this morninu in care of three husky
deputy constables. ,,
Result-.No.. 2âtA; bunch .o.f seventeen
men storming the Chief of Police's of
fice at opening hours to-day with sev
enteen kinds of complaints to lodge
against the patrolman who had strayed
from the narrow path.
Result No. 3â One marred policeman
relieved of star and ordered to face his
superiors, with every prospect that his
term of service, begun only last Octo
ber, will abruptly end.
Kentz must also answer to a charge
of disturbing the peace, his freedom
having been gained by the depositing
of $20 bail. s -
Kentz has a dim recollection of the
events at the picnic. They came so
fast that one crowded the other out of
his mind. When he got out of hiÂ«
trance he found his countenance filled
with projecting knobs and contusions,
while an eye in colors lurid and a cut
here and there in relief gave a realistic
touch to the joys of the outing.
Deputy Constables Green, Wagner
and Asher supply the missing details.
Kentz, they say, conducted himself en
tirely out of the lines set for good po
licemen to follow. So unconventional
was the Oaklander that the officers at
the park Insisted he should retire.
Kentz, bibulously belligerent, declined
the invitation to depart. But he must
leave, " declared * the constabulary.
"Must" did not strike Carl as quite the
Avord. However, things began to move
about that time.
Kentz would not go.
So they took him. It was a merry
mix-up, but as the overwhelmed police
man afterward asserted, "Three meti
were too many for me after I sprained
rny knee on the railroad 1 - track."
They landed Kentz in jail after he
had been patched up at the Receiving
Hospital.
Seriously, the i deputy constables
charge that Kentz acted outrageously

Judge Ogden this afternoon ordered
the estate c-f the late Captain Daniel
E. Martin to be distributed. The prop
erty is appraised at $103,293. The Mar
tin home at 1323 Harrison street has
been set apart to the widow and the
following distribution made to the
heirs: To Mrs. Pauline Martin, the
widow, $30,000; to Mrs. Marie L. Mitch
ler, $20,000; to Mrs.* Catherine M.
Sperry, $9500; to Alfred G. Mitchler,
$4750; to Mrs. Mary P. Roff, $2850; to
Mrs. Florence H. Requa, $950; to the
Ladies' Protective and Relief societies
of Oakland and San Francisco, $3000
each, and to the Protestant Orphan
Asylum of San Francisco, $2000.
Final distribution of the estate of the
late Sarah Wakefield was ordered to
day. The deceased, with her daughter,
Naomi, were passengers on the ill
fated Rio Janeiro, which sank as she
was trying to enter the Golden Gate in
February, 1901. The estate was ap
praised at $128,144 39 and goes to Sam
Bell Wakefleld and Frank W. Wake
field, the two sons of deceased.
The final distribution of the estate of
the late Anthony Chabot, who died in
1885, was ordered to-day by Judge Og
den. There was little remaining in the
hands of Miss Ellen H. Chabot, the
executrix of the estate, which origin
ally was worth $1,348,370 72. The de
ceased was or.e erf the organizers of
the Contra Costa Water Company, af
terward merged with the Oakland
Water Company. With the formal dis
tribution of several small pieces of
property, worth in all less than $10,000,
an order was made finally closing the
administration of the estate.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, July 25.
Yesterday afternoon the offices of the
defendants were vacant. The crowds
that gather each morning to watch the
rise and fall of the markets of the world
had departed to ponder on the fortunes
of the day. Figures on the blackboard
told of the fluctuations of the market,
that meant gain and loss to the specu
lators; the world's visible supply of
grain was set forth in imposing figures,
and the millions involved in railroad
bond issues were posted to dazzle those
that would win their fortunes easily.
These are the places J. Fare attacks in
his suit. What their defense will be is
a nut to crack.
"All contracts for the sale of shares
of the capital stock of any corporation
or association on margin or to be de
livered at a future date, shall be null
and void, and any money paid on such
contracts may be recovered by the par
ty paying it by suit in any court of
competent jurisdiction."
Fare has found the court of compe
tent Jurisdiction, and by his testimony
and that of the woman who placed in
his hands the material for the second
suit he promises to add another chap
ter to the history of the Institutions the
legitimacy of whose operations he at
tacks. Regarding the suit Mr. Hutton,
Fare's attorney, said:
"My client, although well aware of
the nature of the business carried on
by the defendants, was deceived as to
conditions of the market, hence de
mands his money back. That he can re
cover it there can be no doubt, as the
soundness of the constitutional provi
sion covering the case has been passed
upon many times. The defendants in
these cases are proprietors of 'bucket
shops,' and I hardly think they will
have the temerity to deny the truth. of
our allegations. All we can do i#to re
cover the money lost by my client and
his assignor. The police have attempt
ed many times to close these bucket
shops, but without success. \ If all their
victims would follow in the footsteps of
my client, however, these illegal insti
tutions would soon cease to exist."
There Is trouble among those that
buy and .sell stocks on "margin." J.
Fare, well learned as an operator in
the ways of the "margin" dealers, is
the latest speculator In the institutions
on Leidesdorff street to voice a protest
in the courts against the methods that
lost him his gold.
Fare filed two complaints yesterday
against the quoters of "longs" and
"shorts." In the first suit he seeks to
recover from the Central Grain and
Stock Exchange $2661 13 lost through
"margin" deals, and in the second he
prays, as assignee of Mrs. C. A. Ste
phen, for judgment against W. C. Car
penter and W. F. James for I130O on
stock transactions which he claims are
not sanctioned by law.
H. W. Hutton, Fare's attorney, says
that while his client was not ignorant
in the ways of the "margin" dealers, he
was deceived as to the profit that was
promised him in the transactions at Is
sue in the first suit filed. Taking ad
vantage of a. constitutional provision
he seeks by means of the court to re
cover the gold he parted with. The
provision referred to is article 4, sec
tion 26, of the State constitution, and
is as follows: v
The subject was presented to the at
trntion of the board by Secretary Wil
bur Walker of the Merchants* Ex
change. He read a letter received from
th^ custodian of the Alameda exhibit
at St. Louis, who stated that Governor
Pardee in. anxious to know what is to
b*Â» done with the Alameda exhibit and
whether money would be appropriated
to pay the expense of moving it to
Portland.
â¢Commissioner W. H. Weilbye ad
dressed the board on what had been
done at St. Louis and answered many
questions in regard to what he thought
of the* benefits to be derived from such
advertising:. He was in favor of an
exhibit at Portland, and said that thou
sands of people at St. Louis had been
attracted by rhe Alameda exhibit and
had been told of Alameda County and
Its resources. The Supervisors seemed
much impressed with the report and
Supervisor Rowe then said:
"I feel that we made no mistake in
appointing the commission to repre
sent Alameda County at St. Louis. I
believe we will make no mistake if we
look far ahead and take such action
now as will give this commission the
power to order the saving of so much
of the exhibit as can be used and have
It shipped, and that it is the sense of
this board that Alameda County make
a.n exhibit at the Portland fair."
This resolution was unanimously
adopted. Further action was deferred
to another meeting owing to the ab
sence of Sur>ervisor Talcott. The ex
pense of making such an exhibit it was
estimated would be about $6000.
By resolution to-day the Board of Su
pervisors agreed to make an exhibit at
the Lewis and Clark Exposition, to be
held In Portland in 1905. It was fur
ther resolved that so much of the Ala
meda County exhibit now at St. Louis
as can be â¢ used is to be saved and
mov<?d to Portland.

roll, erstwhile champion hammer
thrdwer of the United States, chopped
his way to-day through the locked,
doubly barred and nailed door that
blocked bis entrance into Mrs. C. Pres
ton's shop at Fruitvale. Pistol in hand,
the storekeeper awaited the onslaught,
but she was not otherwise on war foot-
Mrs. Preston made only a technical
resistance to the process server. He
was there to sell. out her stock of
gpods under an execution on behalf of
the Lean Law and CoHection Agency.
The Avoman resisted the service of
the execution several, days ago When
the 'constable went, to the store. In
stcaQ of submitting quietly Mrs. Pres
ton displayed a revolver and threatened
to shoot the -flrst person who should
step over the threshold of her, shop.
This rather set * back -the operations.
Constable Carroll satisfied the law by
tacking the document in j front of the
store. He waited the legal time and
returned to-day to sell out the stock
to satisfy the judgment.
Mrs. Preston had -locked the door,
obstructed it with bars and then nailed
it down with small spikes. As Carroll
splintered the casing by lively blows
and ripped panels- out of the securely
fastened" door * it -yielded, and he en
tered, only to face Mrs. Preston. But
she did not attempt to use her pistol.
Her remonstrance was that the stock
was not her property. It was sold to
G. M. Watson.

The transcontinental railroad com
panies have agreed by a Joint resolu
tion to extend , no free transportation
to the St. Louis . Exposition to em
ployes of their lines after August 15.
This action is attributed to the heavy
passenger movement which 'Is expect
ed to, materially increase after the
date mentionad, and the transporta
tion companies figure that the carry-
Ing capacity of all their rolling stock
will be needed to meet the require
ments of the traveling public. The
official notice that the issuance of free
transportation would be limited to. the
period' prior to August 15 was given
out yesterday and caused no little dis
appointment among local * railroad
employes who had been planning to
go to the exposition after, abatement
of the hot spell in St. Louis. Under
this new and unexpected ruling many
employes will\ have to. forego their
trip ; unless they decide to . pay their
fares.""-"* : <.â¢'â¢' Â¦â¢â¢ Â¦ '..:â¢/,'*Â¦ o

The Mayor said it was his opinion
that the report was not made in good
faith, and the committee was. taking
snap Judgment, since there is a suit in
court to determine, the tenure of
Health Department employes. The
Mayor charged that the Supervisors
stood sponsors for some laborers in
Chinatown and asked Brandenstein if
he had not asked that one O'Neill be
employed there. Brandenstein replied
that he had after O'Neill had been dis
charged and was told to go and see
Abe Ruef.
Boxton created amusement when he
said that "civil service was all right
for those who had the machinery .of
government, and that he had helped
civil service employes' to get their po
sitions by bringing his political pull to
bear." '
The vote on the adoption of the re
port was: . .
Ayes â Booth, Brandenstein, Braun
hart, Comte, Connor, D'Ancona, Eg
gers. Hocks, McClellan, Payot,

Major C. M. Perkins, who command
ed the marine guard of the Philadel
phia at Samoa in 1899 when the Amer
ican and British forces were ambushed
and officers and men of the allied party
killed, was also a passenger on the
China. He has been on duty at Manila.
Paul Cowles, . manager of the West
ern division of the Associated Press,
returned on the liner. He went to the
Orient to organize the war service of
the Associated Press. He turned the
organization over to Martin -J. Kgan,
who is now in charge, with headquar
ters at Tokio. The Associated Press
has a dozen staff correspondents, cov
ering as many important points of the
vast war operations, and emplovs an
army of interpreters and messengers.
Cowles says that the correspondents
pervisors' office under civil service It
would receive his support.
WAS AT SAMOA.
Among the passengers who arrived
here yesterday on the "-er China was
Rear Admiral P. H. Cooper, who suc
ceeded Admiral Evans In command of
the Asiatic squadron. Admiral Cooper
is in poor health and has come home
to be retired at his own request. He
was accompanied by his flag lieuten
ant, Victor Blue; his secretary, Ensign
H. L. Wyman, and Surgeon F. E. Mc-
Cullough of the navy. Lieutenant
Blue's wife, who is Admiral Cooper's
niece, was also of the party.
Lieutenant Blue rendered conspicu
ous service during the Spanish-Ameri
can war and is one of the heroes of
that unpleasantness whose realization
of the eternal fitness of modesty, even
in a matter of dashing heroism, has
prevented any subsequent marring of
the impression his gallantry made upon
his home-staying fellow citizens.
Not that Blue cares about the im
pression any act of his might have
given. He is devoted to his duty as
he finds It and, for all the sign ,he
gives, has long ago forgotten all about
how he took his life in his hands as
Â¦the lone volunteer on as forlorn a hope
as sailor or soldier ever undertook.
Blue has been ordered to the Buffalo,
probably as navigating officer. His
brother, Dr. Rupert Blue of the marine
hospital service, met him in quarantine
yesterday.
The man that can handle any i
amount of money in the Orient and
balance his cash has gifts the gods
might envy, according to Cowles' story
of the exchange troubles that beset
his path as financial agent for a dozen
correspondents. The money changes
in every district. In each district only
tho district's kind of money circulates,
and every time the traveler visits the
banker an appalling percentage or
one's funds is dropped into the "ex
change" kitty.
Cowles, with $3000 in American gold,
which is at a premium in Japan,
wished to purchase Japanese yen. It
seemed easy and promised a profit. At
the bank, however, his gold was first
exchanged into taels and for this op
eration a 'substantial commission was
charged. With a few more strokes of
the pen the banker converted the taels
into yen and again deducted "ex
change."
"If I had been a man of indecision,"
says Cowles, "and had changed my
mind once or twice as to the kind of
money I wanted, I probably would
have used up my $3000 in exchange and
owed something to the banker ' before
I left the counter."
G. A. Goss, another passenger, is a
former member of Yale's football team.
He has been In Borneo hunting ento
mological specimens. He has presented
the result of his labors to the Smith
sonian Institution.
E. Carlson, a Russian banker, was a
passenger on the China.
Cowles visited Chefu, Tientsin,
Peking, Shanhaikwan and New
chwang.
MYSTERY OF EXCHANGE.
of American newspapers feel that they
have a grievance against the Japa
nese war department. They recognize
Japan's right to shut out the news
paper men, but object to the Japanese
method of asserting it. Instead of
treating frankly with the press rep
resentatives, the Japanese have hel.d
thorn in suspense with smoothly
worded excuses and Indefinite prom
ises. Hope deferred is making nervous
wrecks of many of the correspondents,
says Cowles, and in ' all probability
most of the special men will be ordered
home.

When the question Of adopting the
Finance Committee's report was put,
Boxton questioned the right of the
Finance Committee to fix salaries.
D'Ancona replied that there was no
such intention, but that a specific ap
piopriation was made for the salaries
of each department, which, he alleged,
had been exceeded.
MAYOR QUOTES CHARTER.
Mayor Schmitz quoted from the
charter, showing that, the Health
Board has sole Jurisdiction over the
disposition of its appropriation and
the fixing pf salaries. ! Health Officer
Ragan explained the. course of the
Health Board in merging the labora
tory and food department funds and
urged the board not to adopt the re
port. Â¦
Braunhart referred to the alleged
attempt j that is being made to over
throw " civil service. .The j Mayor
thought the Supervisors' should . in
their solicitude for civil service, which
he said was commendable, 'set the ex
ample by taking their clerks '.from, the
eligible list. Braunhart replied that If
1 the Mayor would submit a requestyto
amend the charter by placing the Su-
Brandenstein characterized the re
ply of the Health Board as a "jumble
of rhetoric bordering on a declaration
of rights and of independence, but it
did not remove the charge of the
Finance Committee that the civil ser
vice regulations had been violated' and
the salary allowances of the budget
had been exceeded by the. Health De
partment."
'"There is much that is cpntemptible
in the- reply," said Brandenstein. Con
tinuing, he said: "It should be con
signed to the waste basket, but I Will
move that it be placed on file." His
motion prevailed.
D'Ancona stated that his report was
not designed to impugn the motives of
the- Health Board and that he would
decline to answer the personalities
contained in the reply of the board
named.
UKANDKNSTEIX REPLIES.
The assumed censorship over the vital man
agement ot the Health Commission by the
letter of this report will' emasculate, all the
determined good of the laboratory department,
no matter how efficient 1U policy. It strikes
at ihe integrity of purpoce of the Health Com
mission, the very knowledge ul existlnr re
quirements in our department and places the
Board cf Health beneAth the dictation of the
tyrannical member of the Health Committee
of your board, who confesses that he acts as
a Supervisor only and is not guided in his cal
culations as a physician. If his judgment is
that of a layman, he Is out of place and if
he acts under the cuise of a physician he cer
tainly ham fhown such unwarranted incom
petency as to make his statements of forgetful
regard.
The Health Board will resist . having their
commission made the premeditated and. spe
cific battlejrround on which the doubtful prob
lems cf the civil service are to be worked out
and announced to us by the "Sponsors ' of this
report, to which our attention, has been called.
It seems very stranre, and we believe with
intent, for the remaining Â¦ members, of th*
Finance Committee to disclaim. any knowledge
of this rc:>ort before presentation, and yet
were willins to urge Us passage..
It is a sid commentary on the health mat
ters of thin city that interference becomes
possible within the charter rights of the Health
Oomn:issioJ. through the agency of an usurped
power of a member of the Health Committee.
Where legal proof shall disclose error In our
rulingr; where the courts declare our actions
illegal concerning any Infringement on civil
service rules, although they may be based
through a desire on our part for acquirement
of the most efficient help, tre shall promptly
and at all times comely. With the same deter
mination, however, we shall resist within
charter lights any unwarranted Interference
from any other source. â¢ \
RESENTS CENSORSHIP.
Resolutions were adopted ratifying
the course of Tax Collector E. J. Smith
in bringing suit against Wells, Fargo
& Co. to recover delinquent taxes and
also requesting him to institute new

corporation is not sufficient to satisfy
the delinquency.
Fire Commissioner Parry, Police
Commissioner. Hutton, Commissioner df
Works Casey and Supervisors Bent
and Finn were directed by resolution to
furnish new official bonds owing to- the
Inadequacy of their present security.
The board took up the proposed or

tions of the dairymen next Wednesday
at 10:30 a. m.

The West of Castro Street Improve
ment Club filed a protest against the
proposed intent of the Board of Edu
cation and Fire Commission to submit
to the voters a charter amendment pro
viding for special tax levies for each
of the departments. The club will use
its best endeavors to defeat the propo
sitions.
The City Attorney was requested to
give an early opinion on another
amendment proposed to be submitted
that city property may be leased for
fifty years providing that the building
erected thereon shall equal in cost the
value of the lot so leased. The amend
ment is designed to permit of an ad
vantageous lease of the Lincoln School
lots on Market street. â¢
Brandensteln submitted a resolution
which was adopted that the commit
tees on charter amendments and
finance examine and report on the
question of the advisability of amend
ing the charter so as to eliminate the
provisions thereof permitting certain
officials to employ legal counsel at the
expense of the city and of adding to
the charter a section providing that the
functions heretofore discharged by such
counsel be intrusted to the City At

BERLIN. July 9. â Baron Bennig

Germany's Baron Tramp.
The Isle of Bardsey, off North Wales,
is the remote home of a singularly iso
lated community, and some of the .In
teresting features connected therewith
are noticed In the Field Naturalists'
Quarterly. The dimensions of Bardsey
are, roughly, two miles In length by
one in width. The inhabitants, who oc
cupy some dozen well-built and com
fortable farmhouses, divide the callings
of farmers and fishermen. "They form
a shy and reserved community, gradu

A Puppet King.
THE Democrats of Missouri, however unwillingly,
have nominated District Attorney Folk of St. Louis
for Governor. He has put a large number of
Democrats in the penitentiary, and even has the Lieu
tenant Governor on the way there, and has driven
many more to such an asylum beyond the reacfrof an
extradition treaty. The widespread corruption of the
party in Missouri, and its extended existence and immu
nity, are amo^g the remarkable conditions in recent
politics. The spectacle of a Lieutenant Governor bar
gaining for a price for his rulings and committee as
signments is nauseating. >'Â¦'/,:} 'Â¦?&;Â£.
The work of Mr. Folk has not extended beyond bribe
getting, but if he will improve his opportunity as Gov
ernor to look into th= use made of the public school fund
of the State he will lift the lid off a transaction imrolv
ing a* large number of the eminent men of his party.
The present Governor, Mr. Dockery, had many terms in
Congress, and has not distinguished himself at the head
of the State. .
Mr. Folk must be a better fighter than talker, for his
speech accepting the nomination would be a misde
meanor if there were ..statute to protect the English
language from maltreatment. Thanking the convention,
he said: "This campaign has been waged not for a
man, but for an idea. I have done nothing to merit
this â¢ distinguished distinction," and so -on through sen
tences backstitched, cut bias and built up in defiance of
scowling moods and jtehses; mad at being kicked out of
a place they have held in the language from the time of
Shakespeare. ,
JUDGE PARrfeR is certainly aware that he is a
candidate for the Presidency, whether he is im
pressed or not with the interesting and singular cir
cumstances which surround that candidacy. Mr. Cleve-'
land is putting his dignity to a rather high tension in
urging Judge Parker upon the favor and confidence of
the country. Mr. Belmont and Mr. Dan Lamont, vice
president of one of the railroads in J. J. Hill's celebrated
merger, have sounded the high financiers in New York
and are unable to conceal their pleasure at the promises
of money to grease the Esopus candidacy. One might,
without being uncharitable, harbor a suspicion that there
is an understanding between Mr. Cleveland and his for
mer private secretary and Secretary of War, for he takes
his pen in hand and goes to. print in Collier's Weekly
at the precise time that his former Cabinet Minister
passes the hat. r
Mr. Cleveland declares as to the gold standard that
Judge Parker's telegram filled the plank in the platform,
and that <r no man ever did more for the cause" than the
Judge did by sending that dispatch. Mr. Cleveland is
usually logical, but this gift seems lacking when ;â¢ he
tries to play the politician. If, Judge Parker's telegram
were a heroic thing, what made^it so? If his act were
bravo enough'to deserve all that has been said about it,
what made it brave? If tK Democratic convention fa
vored the gold standard and if that measure of value were
safe in its hands and in the hands of the party it repre
sented, then there was no need of Judge Parker's tele-
WILL PARKER RESIGN?
MISSOURI FOLK.
Lawyers will be interested in the fol
lowing unique decision of a Tennessee
court. In Nashville and K. R. Com
pany vs. Davis, 78 Southwestern Re
porter, 1051, a goose is held not to Ki "an
animal or obstruction." within the Ten
nessee statute (Shannon's Code, sec
tion 1574, subsection 4), requiring the
alarm whistle of a locomotive to be
sounded and the brakes on a train put
down, and every possible means em
ployed to stop the train to prevent an
accident, when "an animal or obstruc
tion" appears on a track. The court
says it is true a goose has animal life,
and in the broadest sense it is an ani
mal, but it does 'not think the statute
requires the stopping of trains to pre
vent running over birds. Birds have
wings to move them quickly from
places of danger, and it is presumed
that they will use -.'.era, though this
may be a violent presumption in the
case of a goose, which appears to be
loth to stoop from its dignity to even
escape a passing train. "But the line
must be drawn somewhere, and' we
are of the opinion that the goose Is a
proper bird to draw it at."

It will be well for. Uncle Sam to keep a sharp look
out along xhe southern border for many moons to come.
A San Francisco lawyer has received a concession from
the Mexican Government to import Chinese coolies and
to establish a "Little China" on the western coast of
our southern neighbor. The Chinese are proverbially
weak under temptation and are of a migratory disposi
tion. In connection with the fact that residence in the
United States 'is more desirable than in Mexico it will
be wise for Uncle Sam to be on guard.
Newfoundland appears to be profoundly dissatisfied
with the trade arrangements that have been made for
her by the mother country and seeks liberty of action
sufficient to permit her to make reciprocal commercial
treaties that will be favorable to her and not disad
vantageous to the United States. As our near^neighbor,
for whom we have great good will and friendship, we
wish Newfoundland all success. She has many things
we want and we have more that she needs.

RIGHT TO VOTEâ C. B.. San Jose.
Cal. No State of the Union can deprive
a citizen the right to vote on the ground
that he is a black man, for the Fif
teenth Amendment to the Constitution
of the United State affirms -that: "The
right of the citizens of the United
States to vote shall not be denied. or
abridged by the United States, or by
any State, on account of race, color or
previous condition of servitude." In
some of the States citizens, white or
black, are denied the rtgnt of suffrage
by reason of not possessing the quali
fications required by the State Consti
tution, such as inability to read the
constitution in the English language or
write his name. etc.

All came to the rare old fellow.
Who laughed till his eyes dropped
brine.
And he gave them his hand bo yellow.
And pledged them in Death's black
wine.
Hurrah for the coal-black wine.

The scholar left all his learning.
The poet his fancied woes;
And the beauty her bloom returning.
Like life to the fading rose.
Hurrah for the coal-black wine.
There came to him many a maiden
Whose eyes had forgot to shine.
And widows with grief o'erladen.
For a draught of his coal-black
wine.
Hurrah for the coal-black wine!
King Death was a rare old fellow.
He sat where no sun could shine.
And he lifted his hand so yellow
And poured out his coal-black wine.
Hurrah for the coal-black wine!

"The shoemaker to whom I had been j
apprenticed had no need of me when ',
the time came to pay a wage, and he ;
discharged me to make room for an- j
other apprentice. I left the village of i
my birth, which I hated with all my j
heart, and feeling rich in the posses- j
sion of $25 made my way to Berlin. 1
Here I sought occupation as a shoe- !
maker, but found none. When my j
small fund of money became exhausted j
I was forced to find work of some kind, J
and finally, taking advantage of a j
casual chance offered to me, I became \
a waiter in a third-class restaurant in '
a very unfashionable quarter of . the
city.
"After a time the proprietor of the
restaurant, to whom I had shown my j
papers, revealed to some of the regular i
guests of his establishment the secret
Df my rank and birth. From this mo
ment life in the restaurant became un
bearable. The guests used to call me
'Herr Baron,' and some of them who
were rich parvenus took a peculiar de
light in bullying me. The other waiters
made fun of me and soon I quitted the
place in despair.
"In the intervals of unemployment
which had followed on the vacation of
my previous posts, I had enjoyed life
as a gentleman. Both as a waiter and
as a hotel porter I had accumulated
considerable sums of money which en
abled me to live for a time in the style
befitting a Baron. I lived at fashion
able hotels and traveled in the most
luxurious cars to the most expensive
watering places. I ate sumptuous din
ners and gave princely tips to the men
ials who waited on me. Altogether I
lived like an aristocrat and so you can
imagine that it was very difficult for
me to stand on the step of a shabby
omnibus, for instance, and collect one
cent fares. Moreover, it offered me no
opportunities of saving enough money
to enjoy another period of a life of
luxury and so, discontented with my
loss, I abandoned the occupation. From
this period, luck seemed to have turned
against me more than ever.V I suffered
the depths of destitution and turned
my hands to all sorts of occupation.
I went to Hamburg and worked at the
docks as a casual laborer and in the
summer I went down into the country
district and worked as a harvester. The
labor required of me was exhausting
and the kind of occupation did not
suit me at all.
"Rebelling against my fate, I resolv
ed that I would do no more work and
compel society to maintain me. I be
gan to travel about the country, beg
ging enough money to provide for my
maintenance. This mode of life has its
disadvantages, but on the whole I find
it preferable to doing work unsuited to
my aristocratic hands. I live a life of
leisure and my journeys on ; foot lead
me through some of the most beautiful
districts of Germany.- I do not live in
luxury, but I receive sufficient to en
able me to eat and drink and sleep in
comfort.

The Benr.igsen family is one of the
oldest in the nobility of Germany and
this Baron is the present head of the
family.
In the eighteenth century they were
at the zenith of their wealth and
prosperity and kept house in more
than royal style. The present Baron's
grandfather was an Incurable spend
thrift and the reckless way in which
he squandered his princely income in
volved the family property in serious
difficulties. Baron Bennigsen, the
grandfather, in the course of time got
through all his money and had to sell
the family property to cover his
debts. His misfortunes broke his
spirit and ruined his he.-flth and he
died in destitution, leaving his chil
dren without c penny wherewith to
face the world. His son adopted va
rious humble occupations and ended
by sinking Jnto absolute pauperism.
Unaccustomed to hardship and pri
vation, disease overtook him at an
early age end he and his wife, whom
he had married before misfortune
overtook the family, were compelled
to seek refuge in a poorhouse. The
Baron died there at the age of 30,
and his son, the present Baron, was
born in the poorhouse shortly after
liis father's death. His mother died
within a week and Baron Bennigsen
was thus left an orphan. He was
brought up in the poorhouse in com
pany with other juvenile paupers.
Questioned after his release from
prison a few days ago. Baron Ben
nigsen, who Is now 45 years of age,
gave the following account of his life:
"My first recollection is that I was
the smallest inmate of the poorhouse :
in which I was born. The old pauper
women in the institution looked after
me and I had not a bad time. Every
one in the place knew that I was a
Baron, for toy birth certificate and
my family papers were in the cus
tody of the officials there,, and no
doubt whatever existed regarding my
claim to rank and title. At an early
age I can remember being sent to the
little pauper school attached to the in
stitution,-where* I, in company with
other born destitutes, received the be
ginning of an education. Later I had
to go to the public state* school in the
village and here my troubles began.
I had to wear a little suit of uniform
indicating that I was a pauper and I
etlll have a keen recollection of the
scorn with which the elder children
looked down on me. They bestowed
on me such names as 'pauper brat,'
'pauper foundling,' 'charity boy* and
ao on. I remember how keenly I felt
the humiliation and how bitterly I re
sented the hard fate which bad made
me inferior to the children of agri
cultural peasants and laborers.
"At the age of 14 years the official in
charge of the poorhouse summoned me
to him to discuss Tny future. He told
me that although I was born a Baron
I had neither money nor property nor
the protpect of ever getting either, and
that in these circumstances I should
have to work 'to earn my living. Be

IF Lochiel is around he may consider himself warned.
A Cuban prophet caught the veil of the future raised
for a moment and took a peep behind it. There he
saw the United States at war with Cuba, Germany,
France and Mexico, and getting whipped. After that we
gave up to Mexico all that we took from her by the
treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, including California. Cuba
incorporated Porto Rico, San Domingo and Hayti.
Mexico became the leading power of the hemisphere and
Uncle Sam went over the hill to the poorhouse.
The prophet, not necessarily for publication but as
evidence of good faith, says that he is our friend and is
really sorry for what is coming upon us, for which
thanks. If he could only have held the curtain up long
enough to let us know what Europe ate while fighting'
us it would affect the grain and meat market. Outside
of Russia there is not a European country that can feed
its people during war. or peace. They depend upon the
United States.
The prophet seems to have but little idea of the mili
tary problem involved. The transporting of troops 3000
miles in sufficient numbers to make any impression here
is an impossible task. We could be annoyed by a naval
power in Hawaii and the Philippines, but as for pene
trating our continental position it is impossible. We are
inclined to the opinion that the Cuban prophet has ma
laria and a torpid liver. For one thing we are all obliged
to him. He says that all these things will come to pass
in three or four years, so that most all of us will be here
to see the show.

A -woman who was in Port" Arthur
during the bombardments by Admiral
Togo is quoted in the Philadelphia
Ledger, describing the curious effect
produced on cats by the cannonade.
"I was at my window during each,
bombardment," she has related, "but
only through the day, because at night
I did not dare to stir out of bed. la
front of me there was a little roof on
which five or six cats of the neighbor
hood collected. Each time there was
a bombardment the cats duly arrived
and, having observed them, I on the
second occasion proceeded to watch
them. With my family we passed the
hours looking at them. At each gun
shot the cats arched their backs and
stiffened their legs and seemed both
terrified and furious. Then when a
hissing shell arrived it gave the sig
nal for a frightful battle. They
jumped at each other, raging like ti
gers, and seemed to hold each other
responsible for what was taking place.
The effect was so comical that we
could not help laughing, although the
occasion did not inspire gayety. After
having fought the cats retired for a
while, as though bewildered, but an
pon as the bombardment began again
they went through the same business.
Each time it was always the same."

The island is the property of Lonl
Newborough and was a favorite resort
of his grandfather. He it was who in
stituted the office of king. Selecting
from the islanders one of superior parts
and character, he invested him with
the general authority whlili he him
self possessed as landlord and appoint
ed him as head man, bidding the reÂ«t
to obey his ruling, abide by hia deci
sions in case of dispute and in general
respect his authority. Partly in jest,
partly no doubt to strengthen his vice
gerent's position, he conferred upon him
the title of "King of Bardsey." and be
stowed also upon him a crown, a
treasure and an army. The "crown"
was a gorgeous diadem of brass, won
drously embossed and wrought; tho
"treasure" a silver casket brought from
Italy and the "army" a wooden figure
painted to represent a soldier.
For many years the "king" ruled in
Bardsey under the guidance of hl3
munificent patron, and the title and re
galia are still held by his son. a pic
turesque old peasant. Lord Newborough
died in 1SS8 and was buried on the isi
and.
with the outer world, but still holding
aloof." Bardsey boasts a "king." an.l
the history of the Bardsey throne la
somewhat remarkable.
THE filling of the seat in which Senator Bard has
faithfully served is a public issue now before the
people of California. When we elect a Senator
we do a larger thing than appears to a majority of the
people. Many have come to look upon it in the same
light as the election of a Representative to the House,
the only difference being that there are fewer Senators
and the term is four years longer. But that is not the
correct view. We elect a Senator of the United States
from the State of California. A Representative is justi
fied in his own State if he give faithful attention to the
needs of his own district. But a Senator must not only
include among his official cares his State; he must be dili
gent and dutiful and watchful of the larger interests of
the United States, for he is sent by his State to be a
Senator of the United States.
This further dignity admonishes the people to select
a Senator with care and with due regard to his charac
ter, industry, training and experience. The Senate is
the greatest business body in the world. While the con
stitution compels revenue bills to originate in the House,
where they are licked into shape by the Committee of
Ways and Means, that is the only House committee* that
has primacy over any committee of the Senate. The
House is so large a body that it is unworkable, and its
business is done by a few members of exceptional ca
pacity for work. Each in his day, 31aine and Randall,
Carlisle and Cannon, were the mechanics of the House,
with a larger grasp of its business than any others, and
each in the fullness of time had his reward.
But when legislation goes to the Senate from the
House and is added to the vast mass that originates in
the upper chamber, there are fewer men to work, and
therefore there are more workers than in the House.
Indeed, every Senator has to work. Reputations are not
made by making speeches, but by patient and constant
attention to the vast voltime of the public business of
the country that pours into the Senate for final adjust
ment.
It is true of every Senator that he gives more hours
a day to the duties of his office thanÂ«he ever gave to his
private business. A faithful Senator is the hardest
working public officer in the world. These explanations
are made to disclose the mistake in that view; of the
Senatorship that treats it as a place to sit still and shine.
This State has need of Senators, and the United States
looks to California to do her duty in delegating men
to that high function.
The first thing to be remembered is that while geog
raphy has no relation to fitness, it has a great deal to
do with the temper and mood in which a selection is
to be made. Southern California never had a Senator
until White's time. Both Senators, from the beginning,
had been claimed and taken by Northern California.
Southern California representation has been continued
by the selection of Senator Bard, and it should be per
petuated by conceding- the'- next Senator to the south.
He must be a Republican. The existing and future in
terests of the State require that he should be in accc-d
with the party majority in the Senate, of which there
is no present prospect of change.
Not only must the Republican party select a Senator,
but it must go forward in such spirit and fairness as
will permit tho best selection to be made. Northern
California has now one Stnator and a Cabinet officer, the
Governor and the Lieutenant Governor. So highly has
the policy of concentration been applied that the Gov
ernor, Cabinet officer and Senator are all from one
county, while the Lieutenant Governor is located not
far away. It is just to Southern California to admit
that her splendid Republican vote gave us the present
State administration. She t has now one Senator, and
that situation should be left undisturbed.
When ' Southern California selects the man desired to
represent their people and the Republican party of that
end of tne State, there should be amiable acquiescence
in the choice. We puf stress upon the point that this
concession be understood now, and that Southern Califor
nia understand now that she is entitled to one seat in
the Senate and that the Republican party of the State
will abide by that. understanding, and awaits the indica
tion of her choice. We^do not put this forward to pa
tronize Southern California or as a matter of tolerance,
but as a matter of right and of justice, which the party
will contest or deny to its own injury and that of the
State. There are able men in Northern California who
aspire to the Senatorship. It is a laudable ambition, but
nothing is more laudable than justice, and in politics
nothing pays a bigger dividend.
asked me if I had a taste for any par

that I was discharged from the insti

gram, for nothing was in danger, and heroes, rushing
to the rescue, were not in demand.
Quite unconsciously Mr. Cleveland makes it plain that
the party was not in favor of sound money and was as
deep in financial heresy as it was in 1896 by lauding
the great service performed by Judge Parker's telegram!.
But what will the country think about it? What au
thority-has the candidate to fill blanks in the platform?
If he may will things into it he may also take things out
of it. Mr. Cleveland does not intend it so, but he is
directly encouraging something that is fatal to political
good faith.' . . . â¢'
If Judge Parker alone can commit his party to one 1
principle against its will, he may do as he pleases with
every declaration it has made. It is natural that Mr.
Cleveland should take that view of it. He worked a good
deal at filling blanks. himself when in the Presidency, but
his party would not permit "itself to be guided by the
filling he put in the blanks, nor is there any reason to
believe that it will take any more kindly to Judge Par
ker's dictation. The high financiers are not giving mil
lions to help the Democratic party, but to try and elect
a candidate who will^et his party do the blustering
while he "restores confidence" by justifying the good
opinion of him expressed by J. J. Hill and John D.
Rockefeller.
While all these signs and tokens interest the poli
ticians, the people are curious to know why Judge Par
ker does not resign from the bench. He is paying no
attention to his judicial duties. His mornings are given
up to breakfasts on his yacht with politicians. At noon
time he lunches with politicians at the house of his
friend Sheehan. In the evening he dines with Belmont
at his own table. ,He is in politics as much as any Presi
dential candidate ever was. Why doesn't he resign from
the bench? Even Mr. Cleveland confesses that up to
the time the gold telegram was sent the Judge's silence
was embarrassing, but he thinks that thunderbolt made
up for lost time and fell upon "the dust and swelter" of
the convention like a wet mop.
The activity of Mr. Cleveland has one motive that is
not declared. The prominence in the convention of
David B. Hill has renewed their old antagonism. The
ex-President was always more likely to impair his dig
nity by expressing his resentment than in any qther way.
He resents Hill's prominence, as a backer of Parker,
hence<these political letters. But why does he not ad
vise Judge Parker to leave the bench?

morning by a crowd of roughs about

W. H. Langdon, Superintendent of
Schools, together with School Director
Cecil W. Mark and Thomas F. Boyle,
acting president of the Board of Edu
cation, spent the entire day on a round
of visits to the several schools. Among
the schools visited were the Dudley
Stone Primary, Crocker Grammar,
Hamilton Grammar, Horace Mann
Grammar, Mission High, Lowell High
and Girls' High School. They found
a large increase in attendance at all
the schools, but especially at the high
schools. The Crocker and the Hor
ace Mann, the latter having the sixth,
seventh and eighth grades, were the
most crowded among the grammar
schools. The same condition extended
to the Polytechnic High School.
/ At the Dudley Stone School, on
Haight street, the one session usually
held has been divided. The higher
grades have the first and the lower
grades the latter portion of the day.
This Is done to give all the pupils
some part of the day in school and
to prevent uncomfortable crowding.
This system may not last more than
two weeks, as by that time it is hoped
the congestion will be cleared.
The Richmond Primary School is be
ing raised, and for the next month
the pupils will attend at three build
ings in the vicinity which have been
hired by the Board of Education.

to award her $200 for attorney's fees,

had breakfast alone and left the house
without speaking to her.
In February a male heir was born.
Until the eleventh hour Ryan had pro
vided no means for clothing for the
expected little one, and the babe was
provided for only by the efforts of the
wife and her relatives. And for four
weeks after the youngest Ryan opened
his eyes to the* fogs of San Francisco
there was no money for his proper
care. The husband's ability to have
done otherwise is set forth in the
statement that he receives a salary of
$175 a month, has $3500 In bank 'and
owns two lots in Alameda.
Continuing her charges, Mrs. Ryan
declares that, without consulting her,
Ryan arranged for a christening and
invited a host of friends to the house
and ordered an abundance of liquid re
freshments for their delectation. Her
objections were overruled in anger.
Finally he is said to have abandoned
wife and babe on April 8 in "cold blood
and in a cool and cruel manner." She
asks for $50 a month alimony and at
torney's fees.
CALLED HER A FOOL.
Among the tragedies and comedies
of the divorce court the sympathetic
have a chance to weep and the scof
fers to laugh in the complaint filed
yesterday by Maud Ryan against her
husband Patrick. The complaint would
serve as a sketch for a "problem nov
el." The wife sets forth that they were
married in November, 1902. In March
of the following spring the yoke be
gan to gall. The husband exhibited a
violent rage because the wife requested
a tew cents "with which to buy house
hold furniture."
Last summer, according to the com
plaint, they went to the Sierra Moun
tains to spend a vacation. The wife
was in delicate health. After two
weeks among the peaks and pines, it is
said, the husband desired to change
the scene of his rural pleasures to a
point in Lake County. They boarded
a train, but, according to the wife's
averments, he was talkative and noisy
and made remarks which the passen
gers heard and which subjected her
to deep humiliation. When they ar
rived on the San Francisco side of the
ferry Ryan is said to have declared
that he would take the Lake County
outing alone. The wife was duly
shocked, but went home and waited
for two weeks until his return.
WAITED BY THE WINDOW.
To Mrs. Levy he shows further grati
tude for attentions by bequeathing her
his books, pictures and other personal
effects, including his decoration of
Chevalier of St. Gregory, and feeling
that he had provided sufficiently for
the Levys he gives to their child, Lu
cille, a picture of himself by Slckelcow,
a Florentine pin and his gold cuff but
tons. /
Yoell's various churchly bequests are
as follows: Five hundred dollars to the
Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum for
boys at San Rafael: $500 to the same'
organization for girls at South San
Francisco, $200 to the parish priest in
whose church he might die for masses
for the repose of his soul, $300 to the
Jesuit order at 214 Hayes street for
masses, $100 for the Gentlemen's Sodal
ity of St. Ignatius Church for religious
rites and preparation for the transmis
sion of his body to Santa Clara and
$300 for the purchase of a burial lot In
the Catholic cemetery at Santa Clara.
The residue of the estate goes as fol
lows: Twenty-five per cent to Emily
F. Dunn, 15 per cent to Rodney Yoell,
15 per cent to Mary G. Parkhurst, 15
per cent to Charles S. Levy, 15 per cent
to Herbert A. Yoell and 15 per cent to
William A. Yoell. /
MRS. LEVY GETS MORE.
John H. Yoell, a son, is cut off with
out a penny, the father stating that he
has given him and paid out for him
"large sums of money, greatly in excess
of any share he could possibly have" in
the estate. He also says that his
daughter, Emily F. Dunn, has received
real estate and money equal in value to
her share, and he leaves her nothing.
To Gertrude Ellen Yoell, Beatrice Ellen
Yoell and Mary G. Parkhurst he gives
$5000 each, and $5000 to his son, William
Alfred Yoell. A half-interest in his
Santa Clara realty is bequeathed to his
grandson, Rodney Yoell.
Discussing his attitude toward his
son, Herbert A. Yoell, the deceased pio
neer says: "Having great fear that any
sum I might have left to him would
never be of any benefit to his wife or
child, I give to my grandson, Law
rence Yoell, $5000," and if any other
children are born the amount is to be
divided.
Yoell's last testament was dated Jan
uary 27 of this year. After stating that
he had satisfied his wife's claim upon
his estate by agreement and court de
cree he proceeds to devise the moat
valuable portion of the remainder to
his daughter, Evaline Amelia Levy,
who, he says, "has been kinder to mo
and rendered me more services and
comfort than all of my children put
together." To this dutiful daughter he
leaves an undivided half Interest in the
property on Montgomery street, south
of the corner of Bush,
To his daughter, Hettie Theobald, he
leaves a half interest in Â»the property
on Post street, near Jones; to his
daughter, Alice V. Yoell, a half interest
in the southwest corner of Sutter and
Larkin streets.
WIFE'S CLAIM SATISFIED.
J. Alexander Yoell, the Santa Clara
pioneer, who died at Highland Springs,
in Lake County, on July 15, exercised
unusual care in weighing the merits
and rights of those who were to share
his fortune after he died. His will
was filed yesterday, together wlth% the
petition of his daughter, Evaline A.
Levy, for its admission to probate. She
said his real property in San Francisco
is worth $160,000, his personal property
535,000 and his realty in San Jose $5000:
The inventory will probably disclose a
larger valuation.
Yoell was twice, married and before
his death deeded a half of his estate to
his last wife. Emily Yoell. On that
account he found it unnecessary to
provide for her in the will and for the
same reason he found it necessary to
look after the interests of his children
by the first marriage on the ground
that he understood that they would
inherit nothing f rcm .Mrs. Yoell. He
leaves several charitable bequests to
Catholic organizations and makes
ample provision for masses in repose
of his soul. He names his daughter,
Mrs. Levy, as executrix and admon/
ishes her to be guided in the adminis
tration of the estatJ by his "good
friend, D. M. Delmas."
Both Smith and White were then
placed under arrest. The women were
sent back to San Francisco by a spe
cial boat. This put a stop to the most
sensational affair that has ever oc
curred in army life on this coast. The
charges to be brought against White
at the court-martial are of drawing a
deadly weapon with intention of shoot
ing, not only a brother officer, but also
an officer who was in charge of the
camp. Major William Black, the com
mander of the camp, was away from
the post at the time.
The president of the court-martial
appointed to try White and Smith will
be Colonel Charles Morris, artillery
corps, and the judge advocate of the
court will be Captain John J. Brad
ley. Fourteenth Infantry.
The whole armv contingent located
Jn and about this department is in
censed over the proceedings, which, ac
cording to report, for total and utter
disregard of the dignity of their sur
roundings and the uniforms they wore
has hardlv a parallel in array circles.
The cape of White is said to be a
perious one. When the midnight car
nival was at its height at the Dis
charge Camp last week, and when the
revelers were in the midst of their or
gies. Lieutenant H. A- Hanigan is re
ported to have burst open the door.
He w#as met with a sight that he will
pever forget. Confusion reigned. Scan
tily clad women were dancing to the
music of lascivious songs. For the
moment the commands of Lieutenant
Hanigan to desist from the wild rev
elries were unheeded. Suddenly, it is
reported. White drew his sword, and
then casting that aside, drew his re
volver and threatened to Ehoot Hani
gan if he dared to enter the room.
b'mith realized the situation and
dr.shed the gun from White's hand.
The escapades of Lieutenants Wil
liam W. "White and Charles F. Smith
at Angel Island have landed them face
to face with a court-martial.
White's trial is set for 10 o'clock to
morrow morning. Smith's case will be
called as soon as the papers can be
prepared.
General MacArthur has shown great
forbearance toward both these young
oflicers. When the first scandalous
proceedings at Fort McDowell were
brought to his notice he tempered-jus
tice uith mercy, and temporarily let
the matter rest. Ke hoped that the
officers would see the errors of their
nays and redeem themselves from
their unenviable position. It is charged,
however, that they have added insult
to injury by the recent gross and aban
doned orgies at the Discharge Camp.

MICE AND MEN
- ADVERTISEMEyrS.
I Women who work, whether in 'the house, J
store, office or factory, very rarely have the
ability to stand the strain. The case of
Miss Frankie Orser, of Boston, Mass., is
interesting to all women, and adds further
proof that woman's great friend in need is
Lydia E* Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
" Deab Mbs. Piskham : â I suffered misery for. serer-l years. My back
ached and I had bearing 1 down pains, and frequent headaches. I would often
wake from a restful sleep in such pain and misery that it would be hours before
I could close my eyes again. I dreaded the Ion? nights and weary days. I
could do no work. I consulted different physicians hoping to get relief, but,
finding that their- medicines did not cure me, I tried iydia Â£. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound, as it was highly recomended to me. I am glad that
I did so, for I soon found that it was the medicine for my case. Very soon I
was rid of every ache and pain and restored to perfect health. I feel splendid,
have a fine appetite, and have gained in weight a lot." â Miss Fhajkxe Obsxb,
14 Warren ton St., Boston, Mass.
, - Surely you cannot wish to remain weak, sick and discouraged,
and exhausted with each day's work. Some derangement of the
feminine organs is reponsible for this exhaustion, following any
kind of work or effort. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
will help you just as it has thousands of other women.
The case of firs, Lennox, which follows, proves this.
* 1^, " Deab Mbs. Pinkbam : â Last winter I
-â¢Â¦JS-S^^r^&^P^&k. broke down suddenly and had to seek tho
advice of a doctor. I felt sore all over, with

isiwcM^fc^^^il^Js^ I had never experienced before. I had a
Â£s$ek Wp9^ Â¦â¢^pgffilj-fV' miserable appetite, nothing tasted good, and
J?&&gl f4?-? "ZS^!g^jPi4&Â§ffl_. gradually my health broke down completely.

AUTOMOBILES START
ON TRIP TO ST. LOUIS
New England and New York Tour
ists Begin Long Cross-Coun
try Journey.
NEW YORK. July 25. â Sixteen au
tcmobilcs, piloted by members of the
Automobile Club of America, started
to-day on the long- run to St. Louis.
The entries originally were sixty-one
In number, but for various reasons
only sixteen appeared to-day. There
were two women in the party.
BOSTON. July 25. â Eight members
of the Massachusetts Automobile Club
left here in four automobiles on a
ICOO-mile tour to St. Louis. The tour
ists expect to join the party which left
New York to-day at Albany,
Major Purdy and 3Ilss Anita Christal,
Prominent in Hawaiian Society,
to Marry Here.
The arrival here to-day or to-mor
row of relatives from the East is. all
that is necessary to complete the ar
rangements for the marriage of two
prominent members of Honolulu's
fashionable society. The steamship
China, which arrived yesterday, had
among her passengers from Hawaii
Major William . A. Purdy, an insur
ance man of Honolulu, whose special
mission to San Francisco is to claim a
bride. Miss Anita Christal. The young
lady is the daughter of the late Dr.
Christal of Honolulu, who was for
many years closely identified with the
history of the island metropolis. Miss
Christal has been a guest, at the St.
Francis Hotel for several days await
ing the arrival of her future husband.
The couple had hoped their marriage
would immediately follow his arrival
in this city yesterday, but their ex
pectations were doomed to disappoint
ment, for relatives of the bride-to-be,
who were to have come from the East
to attend the ceremony, were delayed
on their way to this city.
Plajinff Cricket in England.
LONDON. July 25. â In the cricket
match to-day between Boston School
end Haverford the former made 190

run? for one Â¦wicket down in its first
Inning.
Falls From a Hack.
John J. Sheehan, a hack driver, was
treated at the Central Emergency
Hospital last evening for abrasions of
the chin and nose and a possible frac
ture of the skull. Sheehan was under
the influence of liquor and fell off of
the vehicle he was driving when in
front of a stable at 110 Grove street.
He was removed to the hospital in
the ambulance and his condition is re
garded as serious by the surgeons.
Bell a Winner at Ijonjjnood.
BOSTON. July 25. â The annual
Longwood tennis tournament was be-
Cun to-day. A. E. Bell, the California

sion, winning his match without dif
ficulty. He defeated C. H. Miller. 6-2.
C-I, 6-2.
Servian railroads are being extended
San Francisco will witness, next No
vember, a spirited contest between
forty United States Standard voting
machines and an army of clerks di
recting affairs at the ancient Aus
tralian ballot booths.
The Board of Election Commissioners
last night voted to purchase forty of
the Standard machines at a cost of
$650 each, bringing the bill to a total
of $26,000. But before the commission
would close the contract it pleaded
poverty by demanding that the ma
chine company should pay part of ths
freight on the machines from James
town, N. Y., the manufacturing place,
to this city.
It was a moment of suspense tor
Frank Jordan. When he retired to
consult with another representative of
the company as to what should be done,
J. Cal Ewing, secretary of the Bank
Commission, once Jordan's chief
deputy, ceased telling reminiscences of
the Populi3t movement In Alameda;
Oscar Tolle and Isadore Erb, deputy
Supreme Court clerks, twined their
fingers nervously, and J. P. Cook.
County Clerk of Alameda, a warm
friend of Jordan, began to compose a
protest.
But this anxiety waÂ» unnecessary-
Jordan returned in a moment and said
that, having fully considered the fact
that the order under discussion for
forty machines was Insignificant in
comparison with that for some 210 ma
chines that was sure to follow, he
would come to the aid of the municipal
treasury and out of his own pocket
donate half the freight on the ma
chines, or f 300. This offer was accepted
and a contract was then made for the
forty machines, which will be suf
ficient to handle the voters of two As
sembly districts. A bond for $13,000 will
be filed by the company to Insure the
execution of the contract .
This important work completed, the
commission authorizer the Registrar
to proceed with the readjustment of
district boundary lines under the act
creating the use of voting machines.
After appointing J. F. Cosgrove store
keeper at the warehouse for a period of
thirty days at a salary of $100, the com
mission adjourned to meet again Aug
ust 10 at 10 a. m.
The early betting Indicates that Han
lon will sell a 10 to 8 favorite over
"Battling" Nelson. Shrewd judges,
willing to wager on events and make
their own price, desire to bet on each
man at the prevailing figure.
Hanlon, who is a home boy, is popu
lar and has a host of admirers who
want to wager on him regardless of
price. They will probably force the
odds down a point by the time the men
enter the ring.
Ring followers will not forget the
showing made by Nelson in his battle
with Canole. After being beaten badly
for ten rounds by Canole, one of the
cleverest lightweights seen here, he
kept forcing the elusive Easterner
round after round. By his grit and
bulldog tenacity he wore Canole down
and scored a knockout. This showing
gained Nelson many backers.
Their style of boxing is similar in one
respetft. Both are aggressive and re
treat is not known. When contestants
like these come together a winner Is
generally named before the end of the
fray.
Jack Munroe with his force of ama
teur heavy-weights will open camp to
day at Sheehan's training quarters.
The big fellow will have several weeks
to round into form before he meets
Jeffries.
Harry Pollock, Munroe's manager,
arrived last night from the East. He
will supervise the financial end of
Munroe's affairs. Tim McGrath will
look after the training department.
Eddie Hanlon has donned the boxing
gloves for the last time, prior to put
ting them on Friday night in the roped
arena. Trainer Frank McDonald is
taking no chances o-f having his man's
hands injured, now that the tap of the
gong that will send the little gladiators
at each other is not far removed. Road
tramping, bag punching, rope skipping
and shadow sparring will be Eddie's
routine programme until Thursday,
when he will cease all exercising and
conserve his strength and stamina for
the battle. Big Jack Munroe, Billy
Roche and Tim McGrath Were amcrap
the visitors at Hanlon's quarters in
Alameda yesterday. They observed
Eddie go through his gymnasium la
bors and were apparently well pleased
with the form displayed by Nelson's
next opponent. Hanlon mauled the
bag for six rounds and went through
a few rounds of hand feinting and foot
work with Fred Landers. When rubbed
down and weighed Eddie moved the
scales bar at 130% pounds.
In Trainer McDonald, Hanlon has an
Instructor who prepared several of the
men who gave Hanlon some of his
hardest fights. McDonald prepared
Frankie Nell for his three contests with
Eddie and also prepared Benny Yanger
for his bout with the local lad and Nel
son for the latter's bout with Martin
Canole. Trainer McDonald has im
parted much ring wisdom to Hanlon
and is of the opinion that when his
charge meets Nelson the betting should
be about even.
Object to Dismissals.
At a meeting of the Civil Service
Commission last night that body dis
approved the action of the Registrar
of'Voter3 in dismissing "W. W. Bous
man, Frank E. Preble and J. F. Welch
from their positions as deputy regis
trars. They were civil service em
ployes and the objection Is made that
if a reduction, of force was necessary
some of the non-civil service men
should have been dismissed. A com
munication will be sent to the Elec
tion Commission asking for reinstate
ment. The commission Is planning
the examination of 450 applicants for
positions as street sweepers. The ex
amination will be oral. Experience
and ability to perform the work will
be the basis of the test.
NELSON* TAKING IT EAST.
Avoid Staleness Is the Instruction
Given by Trainer.
LARKSPUR, July 25. â Battling
Nelson spent a quiet day at his train
ing quarters at Larkspur.
He is in excellent condition and
Trainer Murphy does not wish'hlm to
become stale.
To-night and every night until the
eve of the battle Nelson will box with
Frank Newhouse by electric light, so
as to accustom himself to the glare
of the lights he will have to contend
with in the ring.
Yacht Ingomar Wins Again.
DOVER, England, July 25. â Com
modore Morton Plant's Ingomar won
the yacht race from Dover to Boulogne
Sur Mur against Sir Douglas Kerr's
yawl Valdora to-day.
GETS SIX MONTHS IX JAIL. â Maggie
Munroc. charged with grand larceny for rob
bing Walter Williams, was found guilty of
petty larceny last night' in Judge Lawlor'a
court. * She will have â¢ to spend six months In
Jail.
American Wins at Ardennes.
ARDENNES, France, July 25.â
Heath, an American, won a 600-kilo
meter race here to-day.
GILMAN BRINGS A SUIT
AGAINST LOS GATOS RAILWAY
Becks to Foreclose a Uen on the Road
for a Large Balance
Yet Due.
H. K. Gilman of St. Louis, Mo., filed
a suit yesterday in the United States
Circuit Court to foreclose a Hen on the
San Jose and Los Gatos Suburban
Railway Company for $48,323, alleged
to be a balance due on a bill of $250, .
2S4 for railway material furnished by
Gilman at the request of James W.
Rea and F. S. Granger, who, as the
Saratoga Construction Company, con
tracted with the defendant to build the
road.
Gilman alleges that the construction
contract between the railway company
and Rea and his associates was never
placed on record, that the road was
fully In operation on February 1 of this
year and that no notice of the com
pletion of the work was ever filed. He
alleges that the contract with Rea was
made In the name of the San Jose and
Santa Clara Valley Railway Company
and that the defendant is the same
corporation, having changed Its name
after the making of the contract for
reasons unknown to the complainant.
The race meet of the Pleasanton
Horse Association will commence next
Wednesday and will continue for four
days. The. officers of the association
have arranged for five races each day.
The programme includes trotting and
pacing events and a number of running
and special races. The members of the
association have subscribed $6800 for
purses, and this. In addition to the en
trance fees, will insure good purses in
all the events. '
President C. L. Crellin and Secretary
F. E. Adams of the association have
already received assurance of a suffi
cient number of entries to enable them
to carry out the programme of five
races each day. The track, which is
one of the fastest in California, is in
excellent shape, and plenty of stable
room has been provided for visitors.
Arrangements have been made with
the railroad company for the granting
of special rates from San Francisco,
Oakland, San Jose and Stockton, as
well as from intermediate points. A
ball will be given by the association in
the Nevis Pavilion on the opening
night.

BRIGHTON BEACH, July 25.â It was
the opinion of thousands who saw the
fifth race to-day that the stewards will
not be doing their duty if they do not
institute a formal investigation of the
condition of W. C. Daly's two horses,
Himself and Illyria, who were disgrace
fully beaten by Keynote and April
Shower. The condition of the track,
which was muddy, would not be taken
by {he public as a good excuse for the
backwardness of the Daly horses, ap
parently, as on July 7, over a track
heavy, Himself ran a* good second to
Hurst Park in a handicap at nine fur
longs. Again on July 11, Himself made
nearly all the running at a fast pace
in a race won by Hurst Park.
All racegoers know that on a soft
track Himself is, or was, better than
on a hard track. Yet in the so-called
race of to-day neither of Daly's horses
ran anywhere near the two out in front
âthe resurrected April Shower and
Keynote â and eventually they finished
many lengths behind. Many denounce
the race. The betting was suspicious
and the running was suspicious. Sum
mary:

he stumbled at the half-mile pole

falling, losing much ground, and was
unable to get near the front runners

Badger escaped by the rear. It was

The opinion is written by Justice
Henshaw and concurred In by three of
his associates. Justice Shaw writes a
dissenting opinion-
Employment agents can charge as
much as they see fit, according to a
decision rendered by the Supreme
Court yesterday. The law can not reg
ulate their profits any more than it
can those of the butcher, the baker and
the candlestick-maker. The measure
that was intended to restrict the rev- I
nue of the agents is declared unconsti- !
tutional and void.
In. response to an appeal from the Â¦
laboring ciasses, the State Legislature i
passed a law making It a misdemeanor
for an employment agent to charge !
more than ten per cent of the first :
month's wages for his services.
Under such circumstances the agents :
could net* relieve the Chliaman who ;
was secured a job at 510 a month of j
more than 51 and the Hungarian who I
was sent to do railroad work in Ne- j
vada was good for only 5S.
The employment agents assailed the
measure. C. E. Dickey violated the
law and was arrested. He brought the
case before the Supreme Court on a
writ of habeas corpus.
It is held that the provision Is merely
the limiting of the right of employ- ;
ment agents in the matter of making
contracts. The law has nothing to do
with public health, safety or morals,
and hence is class legislation and in
valid.
Measure Is Shown to Be an
Encroachment on Eights

The Supreme Court has decided that j
the directors of the Hibemla Bank
nay continue to increase the reserve

xr.err.bers who want a. division of prof- Â¦
iia will Ret what is coming to them, i
each according to his deserts, when j
there is a final distribution. This will i
rot be particularly encouraging to '
these who wculd prefer spending some i

dales along to their respective heirs ';

ciety was Incorporated in 1S5S under j
tae act cf 1S53. All depositors were
BMXBbcxa and wen entitled to a pro- !
portlocate ehare of the profits. In 1S64 i
the society was reinccrporated under I
the act of US.
The litigants are agreed as to the '
facts up to this time. Mulcahy and
others assert that the new incorpora
tion was simply a continuance of the
first. Certain Martins. Kellys and To
bins e.re cf the opinion that the new
incorporation made a new concern of
the Hibersia Savings and Loan So
ciety.
The Supreme Court does not go into
this question, but granting for the pur
poses cf argument that Mulcahy is a
member, the action of the directors
in refusing to divide that $2,500,000 is
scrutinized. Under the law the direc
tors have unlimited power in matters
pertaining "to the protection of the
bank. If they are of the opinion that
two and a half million dollars is nec
csssxy to liquidate possible losses, their
judgment must stand. It is held, there
fore, .that unless Mulcahy can show
that he is a member and then show
that the directors are acting illegally,
hr must wait until the directors de
cide to divide cr until the concern goes

Fred Fisk, night watchman, found
time hanging heavily on his. hands the
other evening, so he invited a few of
his frier.ds to help him lighten the
burden by accompanying him on a spin
to the beach in a private automobile
entrusted to his keeping. On his re
turn trip, while speeding through the
park, a breakdown occurred, and that's
how Fred's betrayal cf his trust be
came known to his employers. He
promised to pay for the damage to the
auto and Judge Fritz dismissed the
case against him.
John Johnson of S14 Stevenson street
had John Graney arrested for catting
him with a knife, but when the case
was called before Judge Conlan there
was no appearance for the prosecu
tion. Bench warrant issued for Mr.
Johnson and the case continued until
Thursday.
Lena Lancaster, a Porto Rican
danseuse, told Judge Fritz that she did
not much care whether he ser.t her to
jail or dismissed the charge of drunk
enness aeainst her, as business In the
Pacific-street dance hails is very dull
jnst now and likely to remain so until
the \-acation season expires. Her hus
band came all the way from Sacra
mento to plead for her, but she scouted
his aid and yawned while he was in
forming the court that he would like
to take her to the capitaPcity, where
he peddles taznales. She got ten days.
Mary Murphy was singing "Stella"
at four o'clock a. m. on the Barbary
Coast when a policeman interrupted
her vocaiism and incidentally arrested
her for vagrancy.
"Thirty days for you, Mary," said
Judge Conlan, "and I hope that when
you return to freedom you will find
that 'Stella* has had her vogue and
gone to join 'Bedelia.' "
The same Judge then sentenced Julia
U<5ell to twentv-four hours' imprison
ment for vagrancy after the complain
ing officer had testified that she was
too drunk to s:r.g.
"The law will protect your daughter
from this man or any other man who
annoys her." said the Judge to Mr.
Kelly. Carboni was remanded for fur
ther inquiry as to his character.
T. J. Kelly of 2 Chestnut place ap
peared as complaining witness against
Michael Carboni. accused of vagrancy,
and said that it was in protection of
his sixteen-year-old daughter that he
had Michael arrested
"He's a bad actor, this fellow Car
boni," said Mr. Kelly to Judge Fritz,
"and if the court does not aid me In
protecting my little girl from him I
ehall take the law into my own hands.
He Is a loafer and an associate of
criminals, and he has hounded my
child until I am almost afraid to let
her leave home alone."
Carboni, who is about twenty years
cf age. declared that he has been em
ployed en river steamboats, but his ac
cused said that in five years he has
not worked five days.
The object of Mr. Daly's visit to the
Hall of Justice was to procure a war
rant charging Jesse E. Morris with the
authorship of his facial transformation,
said Mr. Morris being then in custody
under accusation of fighting with Wil
liam Wright and John Bocani subse
quent to his fistic attentions to Mr.
Daly. The warrant was refused on the
ground that the applicant was intoxi
cated when he asked for its issuance.
Judge Fritz told him that if he should
return when sober his request would
receive serious consideration.
It was for beating his wife in their
domicile on Seventh street that Mr.
Daly was battered by Mr. Morris. Mrs.
Daly was screaming for help when Mr.
Morris, who chanced to be passing the
house, burst the door and rescued her.
Then, with combined science and
brawn, he beat the face of Mr. Daly
until it was in the condition hereinbe
fore feebly described. After completing
the job to his entire satisfaction Mr.
Morris retired, and about an hour later
was engaged in stern combat with Mr.
Wright. and Mr. Bocani, when his ar
rest occurred.
With due sense of incompetency.
therefore, it is stated that the color of
Mr. Daly's facial cuticle was not indi
cative of the nativity betrayed by his
dialect. His hands and two small
patches cf neck were the only -visible
evidences cf his Caucasian blood. It
was apparent that no portion of his
skin above the. collar line had been
missed by the fists of the decorative
artist' who had treated him. His eyes
were burwd amid black mounds of sable
flesh and his lips were so swollen that
his language wag mutilated. As for his
nose, it zigzagged from base to tip.
His ears, too, were swollen beyond
identification.
â¢Hike Daly's face was under discus
sion by the loungers in the Police Court
corridors for seme time prior to its
cv.ner's arrival there. Various detailed
descriptions cf it had wafted up from
i he booking cSce on the first floor,
where experts in. physiognomy were
unanimous in the opinion that a more
â¢weirdly disfigured countenance had nev
er come to their observation. So antici
patory interest was keen when ilr.
Daly stepped out of the elevator. He
emerged with bowed head, and the
<?ager ones who pressed forward to peer
under his hat brim fell backward with
munr.urs expressive of affright, ad
miration and sympathy when he lifted
his chin and displayed a visage bat
tered almost beyond human semblance.
Veteran ring-goers declared without re
serve that nothing to compare with it
in point of general dilapidation had
ever been produced within a roped
arenaâ not even in the good old days
of London rules and bare knuckles.
And all beholders agreed that the ad
vacce tips from the booking oQce be
low were miserably misleading: also
that to attempt anything like adequate
description of Mike Daly's face as it
then appeared would be gross presump
tion.
Pat Sheedy, arrested for drunkenness,
first held up his right hand, then his
left hand % then both hands, to empha
size his oath that he was not a vagrant,
but a ruralist from Brentwood, who had
come to town to spend a portion of his
savings in riotous living. Judge Fritz
accepted the plea and dismissed the
man, who hurried away with the air of
one who realized that he had a very
narrow escape from a long term in jail.
Edward Sullivan and John Brady
were the names they gave. Mr. Sulli
van wore the conventional garb of the
cowboy favored by Frederic Reming
ton, and Mr. Brady, although less pic
turesquely costumed, looked as if he.
too, knew something about cattle. They
were vaqueros, they said, and Sullivan
was returning from the water front,
where he had left a bunch of steers for
shipment, when he overtook Brady,
who was afoot, and invited him to ride.
The invitation was accepted and the
horse was carrying them to their re
spective homes when "the fresh guy
with the Panama lid" attempted to be
funny at their expense. Suddenly the
horse became uncontrollable and
dashed for the, man on the sidewalk,
but whether- it was resentment of that
person's uncalled-for jeer or desire to
eat the hat that actuated the animal
neither of the defendants would under
take to say. The horse was usually
tractable, and what possessed him to
become revolutionary on that particu
lar occasion defied surmise.
The case was dismissed.

Policeman Dolan said it reminded him
of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, and
that never in his extended experience
as a guardian, of the peace of Market
street at night had anything like it
come within his sphere of observation.
It was about 1 o'clock in the morning,
he testified, when a horse with two men
astride its back galloped over the
asphaltum and drew sarcastic comment
from flippant persons on the sidewalks.
One of the latter wore a Panama hat,
and his jeering remark about cruelty
to animals was Instantly followed by
the horse suddenly swerving and dash
ing for him at full gallop, chasing him,
while the rider who held the reins urged
It to eat the hat. If the officer had not
intervened and caught the animal's
bridle the pursued man would either
have been trampled down or had his
hat utilized for forage. The riders were
arrested, of course, and there Ihey were
to sDeak for themselves.
Frank Bandry of 1161 Mission street
was chasing his wife and threatening
to let out her life by means of a butch
er knife when hs was arrested for dis
turbing the peace.
"You may send him to Jail if you
lite," said the woman to Judge Conlan,
"for I'm tired of begging him off every
time he gets into trouble for abusing
me."
"Are you sure you'll stick to that pol
icy?" his Honor inquired.
"Sure." was the answer.
"Well, I'll sentence him to-morrow,"
Eaid the Judge.
As Mrs. Bandry left the courtroom
her firmness of step indicated inflexibil
ity of resolution. But the Judge appar
ently did not regard her mind as abso
lutely unchangeable.
to Drosecute, angered Assistant Dis
trict Attorney. Harris and brought
sharp reproof from the bench. By per
sistent questioning, however, the attor
ney finally compelled him to admit
that he saw Chavez emerging from a
saloon with a woman named Julia, and
that Chavez* had thereupon attacked
him with a razor, almost cutting his
head off. Further than that he would
not testify-, but detectives were there
v.ith proof that Julia was his consort
and that he had attacked Chavez, who
wielded the razor in self-defense. Case
continued till Saturday.

It Is frequently the case that a party wishes
to sell his holdings for the purpose of reinvest-
ing the proceeds in a different kind of property.
Our long experience In this business enables
us to often accomplish this doirtrte purpose by
only one transaction. The only condition we !
make Is that your property, if you wish us' to
dispose of It for you. MUST BE GOOD OF ITS
KIND AND IN A GOOD LOCATION. Don't
take up | either our time or your own with
worthless offerings, or property to heavily
mortgaged as to leave no actual equity.'
If it has merit, whether you own real estate
or a mercantile or manufacturing business,
bring a description of same to our office, stat-
ing what kind of property you prefer In ex-
chungt. and you will be surprised how quickly
we can effect the result.
THIS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE UNDER-
STAND THE EXCHANGE BUSINESS and are
the only company In San Francisco makiug a
specialty of same. We make no charge for ad-
vertising or any other purpose unless we pro-
cure an exchange satisfactory to you to ac-
cept. ... ..

. Shipping Intelligence.
The departure for Ventura of the oil
steamer Asuncion was delayed several hours
yesterday because a steel cable fouled the oli
carrier's propeller. The steel rone was trail-
Ing overboard from the Francis H. Leggett
and was nicked up by the Asuncion's wheel
when the latter vessel started to back Into the
stream. The Asuncion was delayed again off
Melggs, wharf while a stowaway, found hidden
under the carrenter's bench, was landed. The
stowaway declared that two companions were
also hidden on th? vessel, but a rigid search
proved either that the stowaway lied or that
his companions wore coed hldcrs.

Shortly after the China reached quarantine
a Japanese woman In the steerage gave birth
to a girl baby. The mother and the new ar
rival received every attention and both of
them are getting along well.
The China's passengers included a IargÂ«
number of missionaries. One of these. Rev.
W. B. Burke, who Is accompanied by four
ctildren, is returning home under peculiarly
sad circumstances. He started home with his
wife and family on the Korea. At Yokohama
Mrs. Burke was stricken with typhoid fever
and had to be taken ashore, where she after
ward died. The women among the passenger*
did all they could to help the bereaved mis
sionary with his little children.
The Pacific Mail Company's liner China ar
rived yesterday from the Orient with a large
number of passengers, 2300 tons of cargo and
Japanese gold valued at $150,000. The China's
cargo included raw silk worth nearly $5oo.lKX>
and a large shipment of tea. The silk will be
discharted to-day, but it will be a week be
fore any other cargo is touched, as there 5s no
room for another pound of freight on the al
ready overcrowded wharf. Almost every foot
of the dock Is piled roof high with mer
chandise/ and It was with the greatest diffi
culty yesterday that a tpace was cleared wide
enough to afford a resting place tor the
China's gangway. All baggage was searched
In the corral at the head of the dock and to
get there the China's passengers had to clam
ber over, lilies cf bales and boxes, over the
beds of stalled trucks and at some stages of
the periloue journey were confronted with the
alternative o( waitlnt for an uncertain timo
or crawling almost under the truck horses.
Liner China Arrives.
j The battleship Ohio, which was
launched at the Union Iron Works dur
ing the visit here of the late President
McKinley and which on Thursday
| leaves for the Santa Barbara channel
to have her official trial trip, took her
first run yesterday in the harbor. It
was merely the builder satisfying him
; self that the great fighting machine
i was in readiness for the exacting tests
to which Uncle Sam's naval representa
tives will. p U t the Ohio's every part.
The vessel behaved admirably and
! gave promise of exceeding by a sub
stantial oercentage the standard by
I which she will be judged.
J Captain George Harvey 'piloted the
; steel monster. After describing sundry
i circles and curves in Mission Bay the
i Ohio was headed for Red Rock, and
j during the afternoon was driven at all
i speeds over the measured mile. / x
| The new "battleship handles herself
â¢splendidly. -Several times while going
j at full sr>eed her helm was put hard
I over and the massive hull swept around
I like a huge top, making the turn in
| what seemed to be little more than her
own length. ;
1 In suite of her size and notwithstand
ing the speed at which her engines ,
/drive her, the Ohio makes wonderfully
small commotion in the water. She has
a bow like a pruning hook, and when
going at full speed shrows up a smaller
j "bone" than does the cruiser Tacoma.
Yesterday's trial demonstrated that
. the Ohio's builders had done their work
I faithfully. Engines and steering gear
worked to perfection, and the officials
of the Union Iron Works are satisfied
that the Ohio's official trial will result
j in one more' triumph for Pacific Coast
' shipbuilding.

favoringthe Southwestern millers at their ex

STOCK MAEKET.
NEW YORK, July 25.â Speculation in
storks tri-day was dispirited and decidedly un
lrtererstini;. The market was dull and slug
gish. The recent notable firmness ot the un
dertone. ;n spite of the declining activity of
the demand, was lacking to-day, and the
market was inclined to sag. The movement
was desultory and showed no signs of the
precipitation which usually marks the culmi
nation of an active speculative advance. The
action of the market was not clearly related
to the news of the day and the drop of prices
was in spite of seme happenings favorable to
values', m the ea^ne way Chat bad news has
been ignored en the recent advance. There
vtas a direct reversal oÂ£ the tone of railroad
official comment on tEe outlook from that of
last week, which' was apprehensive of a re
newed period of hesitation in business as a
result of the crop scare. Thin week railroad
officials assert that there has lÂ»een a sudden
revival of cheerful sentiment and an increase
of traffic offering in proportion. A seasonable
increase in the grain movement Is also re
ported, although of moderate dimensions.
Eastern railroads are not in entire harmony
Â¦with these views. The early market was as
tifted besides by some buying for Londcn ac
count. Professional traders in stocks are In
clined to argue that favorable developments ot
this kind are what was counted upon when
prices began to advance and whtte giving some
warrant ior the hieh^r level cf prices attained,
then? must be a limit to the advance war
ranted and remaining uncertainties must b*
taken account of. Cheerful reports from the
iron and steel trade were regarded In the
;>mÂ« way. There is no great doubt remaining
among the speculative contingent that thÂ«
regular quarterly dividend on United States
Steel preferred will be declared to-morrow.
That stock was hÂ«avy, nevertheless. In ccm
mon with the list. Seme of the clocks of ths
independent companies made sharp advances.
Domestic crop news was mostly favorable, and
the strength in ;he grain markets was gener
ally attributed to the eagerness of ( a foreign
demand and to reports of renewed 'uneasiness
over the political outlook. The labor trouble?
made the most positive Influence on the side of
reaction. The threatening aspect assumed by
the meat packers' strike was reported from
the New England cities. A considerable re
trenchment In the labor cost of railroad oper
tlon is a recognized necessity for the con
servation of nÂ«t <'arnlnzs and the growing
spirit of discontent in virirus circles of labor
causes seme anxiety. Sterling exchange made
a rather violent advance in response to the de
mands cf the Ixir.don market and there was
discussion of the possibility of gold exports In
spite of the car approach of the. period of
normal outgo for cur principal merchandise
exr>ortE. No effect *as produced on our money
market, cwir.g to the extraordinary level of
tfae banking surplus. The market closed lr
Â¦âular at some slight recovery from the low
est.
iCanda heavy ar.d dull. Total sales, par

CHICAGO, July 25.â A strong foreign mar
ket, in ' the face of extreme weakness here
Saturday, imparted a firm tone to wheit at
the opening, notwithstanding the favorable
weather conditions and increased receipts.
Quotations on September were up fi#Â»4c at
S7'Â£S7Vic. For a time little disposition to sell
was manifested, and with a fair demand from,
shorts September advanced to 87%c. On the
slight upturn, however, considerable scattered
commission house selling developed, resulting
In quite general selling later. Support from
the big houses that recently had been bulling
the market was almost entirely lacking. In
consequence September declined to SÂ«%igS6T-sC.
The demand on the small break became so
unfavorable that the early sellers hastened
to buy their wheat back, and in the absence
of offerings prices advanced quickly. The un
certainty surrounding the new developments
In the progress of the Russo-Japanese war
was an all Important factor in causing bull
ish sentiment during the latter part of the
day. Some reports of rust were received from,
the spring wheat district, but in the main
crop advices were favorable. -Heavy primary
receipts and weakness in cash grain were ap
parently overlooked by the majority of trad
ers. The market continued strong the re
mainder of the session. After touching 8Sc
September closed' at S7 T Â£c.
Trading In corn was rather slow, the
strength that developed In the market being
more the effect of the advance in wheat than
the result of any urgent demand. September
cpen,ed a ehade to He higher at 49^c to 49%c
ond closed at 49%*549%c.
In sympathy with other grains the cats
market ruled firm. September closed at 334c
to 33 He.
No interest Â»a? manifested in the provision
pit, trading being practically dead, owing to
the strike. . A little long stuff came out late
in the day. causing a slight decline. Septem
ber pork was down 12MiC. Lard was off 5@

Chicago advanced like on. better cable* and
bad European crop reports. I The Chicago wires
of Mitchell. Mulcahy & Co. said:
"Cash prices were firm to a.illtt!Â« higher.
Cash prices In Toledo -and the' Southwestern
markets were, however, mainly sharply lower.
There v.-ere some scattered showers throughout
the West and Southwest, but nothing impor
tant. The strength was on shorts covering and
speculative buying on the cables. The latter
were Influenced both by their own crop situa
tion and a shade lower consols. The strength
abroad and here to-day may be significant,
but our feeling has been and is. with a liberal
movement of ca/h wheat In domestic markets,
together with a probable liquidation .of July
contracts induced thereby, will likely prevent
any material advance this week and may pos
sibly bring about lower prices. Of course,
weather or war news might change it.'"
In this market futures were higher, but the

The general tone of the fruit market was
one of easiness, as local trade was .of a light
jobbing character and there was very little
movement in shipping chancels. Receipts of
Apricot3 and Figs continued light and those
descriptions were, active at ' firm prices, while
other fruits were In free supply and generally
weak. Bartlett Pears were abundant, with the
canner3 purchasing at the quotations. Fancy
wrapped stock way very weak and prices had
a further decline. The Apple market was
heavily supplied. an-J quiet at unchanged rates,
and Plums were weak, owing to the abun
dance of low grade fruit. Receipts of Peaches
In small boxes were- heavy and Included much
poor stack, which had a depressing effect on
the sale of good fruit. The ruling price, for
small boxes was 50c and dealers were unable
to dean up at that figure. Basket fruit was
hard to sell, although offered at greatly re
duced prices.. Melons were in fair request and
some extra large "Watermelons from Indlo com
manded a premium of 11 per dozen. Grapes
were plentiful and continued to drag at un
steady rates. There were no Blackberries re
ceived ' from the Sebastopol region and ' the
market cleaned up better than fcr some little
whilÂ«Â» The other Berries cleaned up well at
good prices. Citrus and Tropical fruits stood
as previously quoted.

are that the' Oregon hop crop will
amount to .about 90,000 bales, or in the
neighborhood .of 15,000 bales less than
last year. The season has been un
favorable, the ; long dry spell which oc
curred, last month very nearly causing
a failure. The quality of the hops la
exceptionally good, however, and there
has been such- an absence of lice owing
to the n warm; weather that many, grow

quired the Issuance of a new bond. The
defendant, with his attorneys, met at
Judge Lawlor's residence at 10S4 Sutter
street, where Charles S. Laumeister
and J. C. Franks, his former sureties,
again qualified for $10,000. No date has
as yet been set for a rehearing of the
case. The trial of Herman Eppinger la
set for Saturday, but will probably be
postponed.
Some of the witnesses who came from
points in Alameda and Contra Costa
counties objected to the fees allowed
them by the court. In addition to thetr
$1 50 a day witness fees they wanted
mileage at the rate of 10 cents a mile.
but the vouchers offered them allowed
this rate for only one trip, the regular
railway rates only being allowed for
the other days.

The attorneys for the defense -were
evidently dissatisfied with these an

and should be more fully discussed."
The Judge said that any further dis

Dunne took exception. -' * .

statement which' brought forth the re

cused the court of a breach of faith,
inasmuch as a promise had been made
to answer a question propounded by
Juror Shannon and this promise, Dunne
said, had not been kept. District At

would render a decision and. advise the
jury later in the day and the jurors
were returned to their room to resume
balloting. Â¦
At 3 o'clock they were recalled and
Judge Lawlor announced that in ad

read the act referring to warehouses
and warehouse receipts. This act pro
vides among other things that no ware
house man shall issue a receipt for
goods unless such goods have, 'been
actually received and that no ware
house shall Issue a voucher unless the
goods are in the store.' The law. also
provides that no portion of the goods
in a warehouse shall be moved without

conclusion the court said it- was the
duty of the jury to consider all. the

which had been ' ordered stricken from'

Mrs. Ackerman Is troken-hearted
over the death of the husband whom
she loved despite his failings. "He was
led astray," she sobbed. "He was a
good man/ and an honorable one, if he
had not/been induced to drink.".' "But 1
he has paid the price In full." < â¢'Â¦â¢- .
Mrs. Ackerman is very bitter
the man and the:two;women who were
with, her. husband on his -last "debauch.
She blames them 'for every thlngn .
Because I am afraid that .employment on
nny rfhlp will be out of question for the pres
ent. Â¦ . , Â»..
I do this for these reasons: â¢Â¦ To enable my
beloved wife to secure my life insurance, as
she is almost penniless.
To save her from the discrace of living
with a man who has behaved as I have.
To show my friends that I thoroughly Tin
derstand the enormity of the offenses that I
lately committed.
Ackerman rented a room at the Gold
en West Hotel that evening. Yester
day morning he was found cold in
death. He had taken laudanum.
In the room was found a letter to his
union chiding its members .for their
lack of charity and asking them to "fee
more lenient with erring brothers in
the future.. His letter to his attorney
gave his pathetic reasons for ending
his life. It was dated first on the sev
enteenth and later on the twenty
fourth, showing that' he had been con

seemed to him that his brother marin
ers were cold and distant. That was
the last straw.
His faithful wife had forgiven him
and promised to stand by him. But he
felt that he was disgraced in the eyes
of men. He returned to his home and
counted the price of his folly. The
caresses of his wronged wife were
coals of -fire on his head and he felt*
that, his disgrace could, only be for
gotten in death.
. Stung by remorse and unstrung by a
two w-eeks' debauch, Captain Carl Ack
ennan of the steam schooner Prentlss
ended his life yesterday at the Golden
West Hotel. Before he took this step
he made restitution in full of the funds
he hatl misappropriated, and assured
himself that the faithful wife whom he
htd neglected was fully provided for.
A ckerman's history is the pathetic
story of a man, honest at heart, lured
by the ephemeral pleasures of the half
world from the paths of duty. ' Led by
designing companions, he flung about
with reckless prodigality money which
was not his, set the wine corks popping
to please . a pair of painted vampires
and forgot his work and his wife. He
has paid the price in full /with the sav
ings of years and his life. .
About* two weeks ago Captain Acker
man arrived here from Los Angeles on
the steamer Prentlss. With. him were
a man named Alex Wise and two wom

manded the master . for bringing . pas
sengers without consulting thÂ«Â» firm.
Ackerman .was piqued' by 'the rebuke
and disappeared with $800 with which
he was.to pay his men., Recklessly he
lost himself among >the flotsam of the
tenderloin. A few drinks jstole his rea

by two graceless women, he threw his
employers' money to the harpies.

of a woman at that address. Policemen
Dougherty and Mahoney were driven to
the place in the patrol wagon and soon
had the suspended youth dragged back
into the room.
The boy was Teortono Cona3 Cruz,
15 years of age, a native of Manila. Ho

They wanted to send him to the Cen

This closed the incident for the time
and the Judge resumed the trial of a
grand larceny case while the jurors
were balloting in an adjoining room.
Shortly before 7 o'clock the jury was
recalled and the formal question,
"Have you arrived at a verdict?" pro
pounded. Foreman McAvoy answered
in the negative and in reply to a ques
tion as to whether they had disagreed
on. a matter "of law or fact responded
that it was neitherâ all the jurors knew
what the law was, there was no ques
tionNas to evidence, but they had made
up their minds and nothing could in
duce any man to change his vote.
District Attorney Byington for the
prosecution and Henry Ach for the de
fense, expressed themselves as satisfied
that the jury be discharged. The twelve
men who have been locked up since
June 6 were then allowed to return to
their homes and were excused from
further duty in Judge Lawlor's court.
Just before leaving the Jury box Hen
ry Muus arose and asked that a poll "be
taken", so that each man might place
himself 'on record. District Attorney 1
Bylngton warmly seconded the sugges
tion, saying j [ that every man who
wished to express his opinion and show
his manhood should have an opportu
nity of doing so. Judge Lawlor ruled
that as the Jury, was already dis
charged the matter was beyond his
jurisdiction, but the Individuals might
declare themselves as they chose before
the public.

Juror Shannon then arose and asked
whether or not all the instructions of
The jury In the case of Jacob Ep
pinger, charged with obtaining money
by false pretenses, was discharged by
Judge Lawlor last night, as it seemed
impossible for the jurors -to agree
upon n verdict. Throughout the last
day and a half of its deliberations the
jury stood seven for acquittal and five
for conviction. On the earlier votes
it stood gix to sLv. During the day
a stinging rebuke was administered to
Attorney Peter F. Dunne of ' counsel
for the defense by Judge Lawlor. The
case has already cost the State thou
sands of dollars and a retrial will swell
the amount.
The jurors voted as follows: For
conviction â Goldwin McAvoy, John E.

quittal â William Pilger, John Mann

and Bernard Gallagher. Pilger at first
voted for conviction, but afterward
changed and voted to acquit.
From the time the Jacob Eppinger Jury
went out at 5 o'clock Friday afternoon
not a. word was heard from it until
Judge Lawlor summoned the talesmen
into the Jury box yesterday morning.
Clerk Martin asked if they had agreed
upon Â¦ a verdict and Foreman McAvoy
said they had not. In response to a
question from Judge Lawlor as to
whether the jury was divided on a'mat
ter of law or fact McAvoy replied that
there was some doubt in the minds of
the jurors as to the considerations of
warehouse matters and there was also
question regarding certain evidence
and what the Jurors might consider
and what not. The point, according to
the. foreman, was whether the fact that
Eppinger was or was not in the bank
ing-house of the International Banking
Corporation at a given time and date
should be considered in advance of all
other evidence.
JURORS IX DOUBT.
On First Ballot Jurors Are
Evenly Divided, but One
of the Talesmen Changes
Vote to- Favor Defendant
When Mrs. Cordelia Botkla waa aske<2
to plead In Judge Dunne's court yester
day to the charge of murdering Mrs.
Ida Henrietta Deane on August 11. 1S0S.
by sending a box of poisoned candy to
her sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Dunning, at
Dover, Del., she stood up and In a loud
and emphatic tone of voice said, "I am
not guilty."
Prior to that Incident her attorney,
Reece Clark, interposed a demurrer to
the Information. He argued that In no
part of the civilized world has It been
held that murder can be committed In
parts. It waa alleged that the defend
ant had prepared a box of poisoned
candy In this county and had sent it to
Jl)over, Del., but that act of prepara
tion did not give this county Jurisdic
tion over the defendant. >Hs also ar
gued that the complaint was defective
because it did not designate the char
acter of the poison, nor was there any
thing to show how Mrs. Deane got the
poison. He concluded by moving for
the discharge of the defendant on the
ground that the Information was not
filed within thirty days 'after the de
.fendant was held to answer, that the
court reporter's notes had not yet been
transcribed and that the complaint had
been sworn to on information and be
lief.
District Attorney Byington briefly re
plied that he had been endeavoring for
two year3 to procure \he transcriptions
in cases prior to the filing- of the Infor
mation, but without success.
The Judge said If the court reporters
could not perform the duties of their
office they should resign. They were
crying out for more salary, and yet
they were always behind in their work-
Clark said he had a suggestion to of
fer which came from the defendant.
She desired the case transferred to
Judge Cook's court, as he had already
tried her twice and she thought the
case would be carried through more ex
peditiously in that court.
The Judge said the trial would be
carried on just as expeditiously la his
court and he could not adopt the sug
gestion.
After further discussion Clark with
drew his motion to discharge the de
fendant and submitted the demurrer.
The Judge overruled the demurrer and .
formally denied the motion to dis
charge.
Clark said the information had been
filed on May 26 and the sixty days
within which the trial should take placÂ«
would expire to-day. He demanded aii
immediate trial.
District Attorney Bylngton suggested
August 15 and hoped that the defense
would be ready to proceed at that time,
as he would bring sufficient witnesses
from Delaware to establish the defend
ant's guilt. The Judge continued the
case to that date.
On August 8 Judge Cook will render
his decision on the defendant's motion
for a new trial in the case in which she
was convicted of the murder of Mrs.
Dunning.
In the case of Mrs. E. J. Nelson of
526 Natoma street, whose distress was
brought before the Congregational min
isters last week, as reported in The
Call, the Congregational clergy have
given the matter the fullest attention.
Mrs. Nelson has been supplied with a
nurse and a subscription among the
clergy may be taken up with the ob
ject of sending her to the country for
several weeks.

'â¢Scepticism in the Church" was the
subject of an address delivered yes
terday by the Rev. F. A. Bissell before
the Congregational Ministers' Associa
tion at" Congregational headquarters,
Y, M. C. A. building.
The Rev. Mr. Bissell said in part:
The doctor declared that there is in
the Chinese as a people the making oi
solid manhood. They are fundamen
tally honest in all their dealings and
they have characteristics that will
make a success even under the condi
tions in fcwhich they live to-day. Dr.
Simester said that the Chinese has a
physical makeup that no other people
outside of the Anglo-Saxon possesses.
This he accounted for by the fact that
from birth John is enured to hard
chips, thereby being enabled to with
stand climatic changes or whatever
conditions he may be called upon to
face. In all his characteristics, said
Dr. Simester, the Chinese are Anglo-
Saxon. As business men they are
acute, sharp, progressive and are up
to a . bargain and whatever bargain
they make they will stand by. Many
people who speak against Chinese in
tegrity and their business methods,
eaid the doctor, have, never even seen
Chinese beyond the deck of a steamer.
Speaking of social conditions in
China, Dr. Simester said that Anglo-
Saxon or Chinese women are so safe in
any part of the land, with the excep
tion, perhaps, of Shanghai, that they
can go unchaperoned or without male
attendance through any city after
dark, fearless of harm or insult.
SKEPTICS IX THE CHURCH.
Dr. Simester comes from the Anglo-
Chinese School in Foochow, China,
â¢where for years he has been engaged
in educational work. His estimation
of the Chinese is extremely flattering
and was given to the members of the
Methodist Ministers' Association that
met in Epworth Hall yesterday morn
ing.
Dr. James Simester sees a resem
blance between the Chinese and the
Anglo-Saxon, if not in complexion cer
tainly in endurance, indomitable pluck
and determination.
