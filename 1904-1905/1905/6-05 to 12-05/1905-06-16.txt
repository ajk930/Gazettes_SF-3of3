The wording of the rescript' gives no

was to regard ; the retirement of Grand
Duke Alexis and: Admiral Avellan as a
concession to public; opinion,' ; followinff
the crowning tragedy of the Sea' of Japan.
Charges of mismanagement and tales of
corruption, and even worse," against the
marine department have been J rife for
years. After the^war was begun they in
creased tenfold, and lately a regular cam
paign against; the department \u25a0< has 'been

Some startling Revelations ' have * been
made; in this; campaign, and Captain
Clado, who was one of the leading critics
of the conduct of the navy, Vwas dismissed

Among those sojourning late in the

Xassa Shish yesterday, demanding an
accounting of the popular funds .sub
scribed for the rebuilding of the navy
and declaring that "great names are no
longer guarantees," was instantly re
called.
DIVERSION OF XAVAL FUNDS.
Although from time to time since the
war began there have been rumors that
the Grand Duke would retire on account
of the savage criticisms, not ;to use
harsher terms, directed against the ad
ministration of ' the navy, especially in
the construction of ships, the announce
ment of his resignation came like a bolt
from the blue. It was not preceded, by
any of ' the: rumors which usually give
warning of such an act. Consequently,
it was assumed that some 'sudden' event'
precipitated it and ugly, stories immedi
ately came to the surface.

The leader of the robbers is supposed
to have been "Bill" Miner, who .served
a term at San Quentin at the same time
that Terry served a ten years' sentence
for counterfeiting. They were cell mates.
Shortly after the train robbery Terry was
employed by the railroad to recover the
securities. His operations were conducted
from Bellingham under the name of
Brown. To-day at Bellingham Terry an
nounced, that his mission has been accom
plished. He says that "Miner will be ar

TACOMA, June 15.â Through the assist
ance of "Jake" Terry, an ex-convict, the
Canadian Pacific Railway has recovered
securities worth $864,000 stolen from the
safe of the Dominion Express Company
when the Canadian Pacific Overland was
robbed near Mission Junction last Sep^
tember.
"Another encouraging feature of the
present increase of wealth is that a large
proportion of this increase has been in
the South, a part cf our country which
heretofore has been largely asricultural
and poor. The change in the material
â¢ conditions in the South, in #pite of the
political difficulties that certainly are
there, is creating a belter state of things
with reference to the racial question.
The woik of Booker T. Washington in
teaching his people tiow to use tools in
elead of giving them a superficial uni
versity education which they cannot use,
added to industrial demand for skilled la-
Ixir, will put the negro population in a
better condition materially, and when
that is brought about, their spiritual and
Intellectual uplifting is much easier. The
Southern fctatts are engaged in adopting
constitutions which seem intended to ex
clude the negro from the ballot, in fact,
without infringing the fifteenth amend
ment so palpab.'y as to lead to their an
nulment by the Supreme Court. I am
hoping earnestly that experiments of this
sort will fail, but if they will lead to a
result in which the laws shall exclude
Ignorant whites and blacks equally from
the ballot then no one can quarrel with
the procedure, which will be square and
honest."
AMKKXCA AS A WORLD TOWER.
Reference was made by Secretary Taft
to "the enormous material expansion of
this country," which adds to its stand-
Ing among the nations beyond that
which could be accorded by them to
one which had no insular possession*
and confined itself within the seas. He
continued:
"The powerful influence which it has
exerted to bring abcut peace between the '
Rusztan and Japanese nations is Itself an
evidence. The personauty of the Presi
dent has had much to do with the will
ingness of the powers to allow him to in
tervene. Confidence in his impartlality
anu integrity have doubtless aided our
national prestige in securing this end de
voutly to be wished."
The Secretary spoke of Porto Rico and
the Philippines, "the burdens which we
have assumed due to the Spanish War."
â¢I do not,' 'he said, "for a moment
contend that now or for years they
will prove anything but a burden to
the United States. We enjoy the bene
fits of the increasing civilization of)the
world by reason of colonization: must
we decline to assume the burden there
of?, â¢ * " Hence, when an alien
people come under our control we
dfteni it. our duty to try the experiment
of .educating them to govern them
selves and we should deem ourselves
cowards and recreants if we declined
to accept the responsibility and thus
throw the people back into a chaos of
anarchy 'which could but result" ulti
mately in -self-destruction or despot
ism." . â¢ .
MAI.iD.MIMSTKATIO.Y OF THE LAW.
Secretary Taft then dlreotcd atten
tion to a few purely""domestic questions
\u25a0with reppect to which he declared the
American people "ought to act. ThesÂ«
included the ' maladministration lof the
criminal law. the' increase In divorce
Secretary Taft touched on the racial
question in the South and in this connec
tion said:
"I>oes the question not answer itself?
Is it not the duty oi members of Con
grfss and of thy executive to disregard
the unreasonable demands of a portion
of the community, deeply prejudiced
upon this subject, in the Far West, and

PARIS. June 15. â The choice of
Washing-ton for the meeting place of
the peace plenipotentiaries gives gen
eral satisfaction here, as it is consid
ered the appropriate ' result of Presi
dent Roosevelt's Initiative.
How the Selection of Washington .la
Regarded in Paris. .
It is well , understood: that the Japanese
Government - will not : make , known prior
to the assembling of the plenipotentiaries
the terms upon i which. she Is \u25a0willing to
conclude peace. ; The|: Mikado '\u0084 Is said to
desire that when peace Is secured it shall
be coupled with reasonable assurances [of
Its permanency. Among well' â¢ informed
diplomatists it is deemed \u25a0 probable , that
Japan's terms,"- once : they are stated, ". will
be regarded by the world : as , reasonable
and likely. to be acceptable. to Russia.
The payment by Russia of any such
cash indemnity, as a billion' dollars'; not
only would embarrass seriously the St.
Petersburg Government but - probably
would disturb the finances of the entire
Western world. Indeed, it has " been sug
gested that such d payment; to all in
tents and purposes, might render Russia
practically bankrupt. " The ; opinions t and
views of the United States and other, pow
ers $n this . subject have ; been per ml tted
tov reach personal advisers of ; the Japa
nese empire.' '-;\u25a0
Pressure is being brought to bear upon
Japan to induce the Emperor to fix the
sum he will demand as an indemnity for
the pending war at as low ; a figure ; in
cash as possible in the circumstances.
This pressure Is being exerted especially
by European Governments, but President
Roosevelt, it is intimated in '. diplomatic
quarters, also . has advised the Japanese
Government that moderation in her: de
mand for a cash indemnity not only
would facilitate the negotiations of peace
terms but would be regarded by the pow
ers with particular favor.
Prior to the formal assembling of the
conference it is probable,' If precedent be
followed, that a peace protocol will be
negotiated. The making of the potocol
will take place before the declaration of
a formal armistice.
JAPAN' IROKII TO BE MODERATE.'!.
It is indicated, however, that the pro
posed conference Is scarcely likely to be
convened " before the middle of August
and perhaps not until a later date. It
may be July 1, possibly a little later, be
fore the arrangÂ«ment for the meeting of
the plenipotentiaries are finally accepted.
Both Russia and Japan are moving with
the utmost deliberations, for the game
of diplomacy now being played is of even
greater importance to each Government
than are the movements of the armies on
the battlefields. It will require at least
a month for the negotiators of the two
Governments, with their respective staffs,
to come together, the distance from Japan
being so great that a shorter time scarcely
could be allowed.
In view of the selection of the seat of
the conference it is expected that, within
a few days at most. Russia and Japan
will announce formally the names of their
respective plenipotentiaries and an agree
ment will be reached as to the time, of
holding the conference.
WILL. HASTEN NEGOTIATIONS.
This refusal was communicated by
President Rgosevelt to the Russian Em
bassador and likewise cabled to St.
Petersburg.
, \ Further consideration of the subject de
veloped the unalterable objection " of
Japan to any European capital as v seat
I for the conference. She .objected par
j^tlcularly to The Hague, believing it- was
I too far within the sphere of Russian ln
! fluence. and for a similar reason she de
j clincd favorably to consider Geneva. Un
j til tÂ©-<iay. however, Japan's irreconcilable
opposition to the selection of any Eur
opean capital was not known definitely.
At a conference which Takahira. the Jap
i anese Minister, harf^vlth President Roose
velt to-day he conveyed to the President
\u25a0 the Japanese Government's llnal refusal
I to consent to the holding of the confer

national capital has been selected as the
seat of negotiations between the pleni
potentiaries of Russia and Japan for a
treaty of peace. The choice of Washing
ton as the location, of the peace con
ference marks another step forward In
the negotiations toward ultimate peace
in the movement Instituted by President
Roossvelt. i . '/, â¢\u25a0 -
Official announcement of the selection
of Washington was made by Secretary
Loeb at the White House as follows:
"When the two Governments were un
able to agree upon either Chef u or Paris
the President suggested The Hague, but
both Governments have now requested
that Washington be chosen as the place
of meeting and the President has ac
cordingly formally notified both Govern
ments that Washington will be so se
lected."
This statement was supplemented short
ly afterward by a semi-official announce
ment that, "after meeting and organizing,
the plenipotentiaries of /the two Govern
ments, if it should be found to be uncom
fortably hot in Washington, may adjourn
the meeting to some summer resort in the
North and there continue their sittings
until such time as the weather in Wash
ington shall be more comfortable." Â«
JAPAX VETOES EUROPEAN CAPITAL.
Now that some of the details of the
negotiations which hive been pending for
more than two weeks are known, the se
lection of Washington Is regarded as the
only solution of the problem presented to
the belligerent Governments. After the
acceptance by Russia and Japan of Presi
dent Roosevelt's proposition' that they
consent to consider the question of peace,
Russia indicated Paris as the most desir
able place for the meeting to negotiate
a treaty and Japan Indicated Chefu.
There the subject rested for forty-eight
hours.
â¢ Finally Japan declined to consider Paris,
for obvious reasons, and Russia objected
to the holding of the conference in any
oriental city. Washington then was sug
gested as a place at which the belliger
ents could meet on common ground, un
disturbed by either political or personal
Influences.
As a means of facilitating the negotia
tions the President suggested that the
conference be held at The Hague, the
seat of the international and the location
of the first general arbitration conference,
called at the instance of Emperor
Nicholas of Russia. He Indicated that,
for both practical and sentimental rea
sons. The Hague would be a most desir
able place of meeting for the- plenipo
tentlaries.
ly esteeming your experience in naval
service and your personal and moral qual
ities, selected you In 1881 as his immediate
collaborator in the work of renovating
and strengthening our fleet. Since then
for twenty-four ; years, your / Imperial
Highness has bestowed your labors to the
"development of our, naval ,. forces and the
training of the personhel of -the fleet in
proportion to the: resources it was pos
sible to accord you for that purpose.
"Now, . yielding ;to your reiterated re
quest I have consented to relieve you. of
the administration of the fleet and marine
department. "_' '-\u25a0\u25a0*'_ .*. "< ..
, "In accepting the resignation of. your
Imperial Highness I direct you to retain
the rank of grand admiral as! an expres
sion of my* gratitude for all your work.
"I remain as ever, your constant well
wisher, with every expression of my
love. , NICHOLAS."

Red Men Are Towed by Leviathan to a
Point Ten Miles Off Cape
Flattery.
TACOMA, June 15.â After a hard and
exciting chase j through stormy waters
Neah Bay Indians yesterday captured a
whale ten miles off Cape Flattery. The
tug Wyanda * was engaged to tow the
monster to Neah Bay harbor, where a
great feast of blubber and oil Is now in
progress. \u25a0 ,
When the Wyanda arrived on the
scene^six canoes filled with Indiana
were being Jerked about furiously- by
the angered leviathan. Much excitement
Xirevailed, as the chase had been a long
one and. there was danger for. : "hours
that the boats would be swamped by
'heavy seas and the antics of the, whale.
The Indians displayed great dexterity
in handling their frail canoes in a nasty
sea while : following the line attached
to. the maddened whale.
That ' the ' strained-, relations between
Mexico and .Guatemala - have '\u0084 not les
sened since General Barillas, the revo
lutionary leader of the latter ; republic,
recently" quit plotting in .Mexico land
came to San Francisco, ; is j evidenced in

of seeming^ neutrality in ; so for; as

ARMY ASU A'AVV ORDERS.
John C. Driscoll was to-day the chief
witness before the Grand Jury and re
- cited what he called the history of the
dealings between employers and union
labor. Driscoll told how the coal team
sters and coal team owners had made"
the first joint trade agreement, which
provided that the oivners should em
ploy only members of the Coal Team
\u25a0tenf I ii!Â«u and that the members of
tue ui.-ioi: should work for no employer
cot :; member of the Coal Team Own
rjÂ»' Association. The effect of this ar
ranseiuent was to force every coal
n!%on owner Into the Coal Team Own
ers* Association and every coal vrasron
driver into the Teamsters' Union. The
owners behind this provision, that
barrtd union drivers from working for
men not members of Â« the association
and prevented non-union drivers from
driving' coal wagons, raised the cart
age rates of coal from SO to 50 cents a
ten for short hauls and to as high as
41 for long hauls.
It was learned late to-nlffht that one
of the statements made by Driscoll to
the jnry vras that President Shea of
the Teamsters' Union accepted SSOOO at
the time of the stockyards strike last
ftcmraer.
This strike was begun on July 12 and
lasted nine weeks. About 26,000 men were
thrown out of work and millions of dol
lars were lost by the packers In business
and by the men In wages. According to
Driscoll's story he went to Shea to see if
the teameters could not be prevented
from going out on a eympathetic strike.
Ehea is said by Driscoll to have replied:
"It will cost $SOOO to keep them, at
â¢work."
Driscoll declared that he raised the
money and paid It to Shea and that the
labor leader wae not able to prevent the
men from walking out. Driscoll after
ward, according to his story, demanded
the return of the money and Shea de
clared that he had paid It over to two
other men connected with the Teamsters*
Union.
CHICAGO, Jane 15. â The grratest
â¢ran da) Chicago has ever known, ac
cording to Sta^fp's Attorney Ilealejr, la
to follow the disclosures made to-day
bftorr the Grand Jury by John C. Dris
coll, when the former secretary of the
Associated Buildinsr Trades and Coal
Team Owners' Association revealed the
entire history of the dealings between
employers and union labor leaders,
particularly that branch of union labor
represented by the Teamsters' Union. .
"More serious offenses have been com
mitted than bribery and conspiracy," said
State's Attorney Healey, "and the evi
dence presented to the jury has been of
an extremely sensational character. It Is
very important and \u25a0will lead to startling
results. The names mentioned by the
witnesses are those of prominent men on
'both sides. If I thought there would be
no result from this Investigation I would
call a halt immediately. I believe the
present line of Inquiry will occupy tho
attention of the jury for the remainder
of this week and a portion of next, but
if necessary all the docket cases will be
sidetracked because of the great Impor
tance I attach to the results of the pres
est inquiry."
To-morrow will witness the gathering*
before the Grand Jury of twenty or more
of the prominent business men of Chi
cago, together vith leading members of
the bar, the State's Attorney said, but
it Is impossible to-night to learn the :
names of those for whom subpenas have
been issued.

Both Harmon and Judson are Demo
crats, And their friends declare there
have been good grounds for their
spokesman in Congress to assert that
the administration is not In earnest in
its railroad rate campaign. Th?y r ~will
take the position that the President
certainly does not want railroad rates
regulated when he refuses to have pros
ecuted a member of. his Cabinet who
was engaged in managing the Santa
Fe Railroad when* secret rates and re
bates were given to the Colorado Fuel
and Iron Company.
CAIi, EUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON. June 15.â How to make
"performance square with promise" in
the railroad rate Issue projected before
the country by the President Is the
problem now confronting 1 the adminis
tration. The announcement made' by
Judge Harmon, one of the special coun
sel appointed by Attorney General
Moody to investigate the charges of
rebate-giving preferred against the
Santa Fe Railroad, that he and Mr.
Judson had retired from the case be
cause they had recommended a course
to bo pursued which had been rejected
by Moody, is taken to mean-that coun
sel desired to prosecute the ofrlcials of
tho company, one of whom at the time
was Paul Morton, now Secretary of the
Navy, and that the administration is
determined to protect Morton.
Attorney General Moody issued a
statement to-day. In which he said:
There seems to be no great reason why the
exact point of difference between Messrs. Har
mon and Judson and myself, which led to
their retirement from the case, should not be
made public and a complete statement, will
reasonably be made.
I wrote Mr. ..Harmon some days ago sug
g-estinjr that if a statement of that difference
should be made it ought to be one upon which
we agreed and asking: his views as to how the
statement should be made. This morning I
received a telegram from Mr. Harmon, saying
my letter had been received and that he wae
now answering it.
Before making any further statement I shall
await Mr. Harmon's answer. .

NEW YORK, June 15.â A verdict for
Abner J. Haydel, architect, to recover
$24.1*4 for Howard Gould for services In
drawing plans for the Gould Castle at
Port Washington, L. 1., was awarded by
a jury to-day in the New York State Su
preme Court at Mlnola, L. I. This amount
represents about 2Vr per cent of the orig
inal contract price of $967,000. which it
was estimated the castle would cost
Gould. Haydel had sued for $60,000. < .
The architect testified that he had been
sent to make plans of the celebrated Kil
kenny Castle to be used in the Gould es
tate, and that Mrs. Gould ordered many
changes in his plans and finally refused
to accept them and ordered him out of
her presence at the hotel,, where he had
gone to consult her' as to the plans.
Judgment llendered Against
Him by Xew York State

Walker has not yet determined whether
he will make further efforts to locate the
ledge. This will be decided after an assay
has been made. From the shape of the
chunk it is evident that it has not trav
eled a very great distance, but its depth
of ten feet indicated that 'it was washed
Or rolled there many years ago. Â«
HELENA. Mont., June 15.â While ex
cavating in Broadway for a water works
connection workmen to-day uncovered a
chunk of rich copper and gold ore weigh
ing fully seventy-five pounds. The rock
was broken in pieces and found to be
thoroughly impregnated 'with copper.
While it has not as yet been assayed, old
miners declare it very rich in both copper
and gold.
The find was made in front of James
Walker's grocery, at the corner of Davis
street and Broadway. Just how t&r away
the ledge is is a matter of conjecture, the
estimates varying from 40 to 1000 feet.
The rock was found in the soil beneath
the mains and was in ground which had
never been disturbed before.

Brain
Brain" workers suffer 1 frora
headache because they over-tax
and exhaust the brain nerves.
Tired, irritated, turbulent
brain nerves throb and ache;
this weakens the brain power,
and robs the memory.
Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills
bring tranquility to the ex-
cited nerves and stop the pain.
If not relieved, this nerve
disturbance is frequently ex-
tended to the stomach, , causing
nausea, vomiting-r-sick head-
ache.
Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain .Pills
are convenient to takeâ just a
little tablet, that in a Jew mo-
ments relieves the" pain; they
leave no disagreeable after-
effects, as they contain \u25a0â¢no
opium, morphine, cocaine or
chloral in any form.
"From ' personal experience 'X - can
testify that Dr. Miles* Anti-Pasn Pllla
are a most excellent remedy for head-
ache and neuralgia. I have been a
great sufferer from both diseases for
the paat three years. A friend who
had also suffered from neuralgia
handed me some of the Anti-Pain
Pills. I took them and they save mÂ«
almost instant relief. Since then I
have a packagre at hotngt. and another
at the office, and they never fall to
relieve me." B. V. MEGART.

that he had been the- legal adviser of

he could not represent the defendant

He . said that Attorney Frank <J. â¢ Mur

case, had received $300 . from the de
fendant's mother, and ha thought it
was quite enough for any counsel to
carry the case, through to. a conclusion.
The defendant and his mother, who
was in court, had a - consultation and,
came to the decision to make an effort
to get Murphy to continue In tha case.
If not the Judge suggested that Attor
ney Reese Clark might be Induced. In
the circumstances,' to represent the de
fendant. The case was continued till
Saturday to see what arrangements
can be made. District Attorney Bying

SCHERF IS YET WITHOUT
ATTORNEY TO DEFEND HIM
Says Underhill Suit Has
Stood Against Him
Too Long.
NEW YORK, "June 15.â Seeking to es
tablish her claim to a* $20,000,000 estate,
which includes a tract a mile and a half
long, and a half-mile wide through the
heart of the city of Quebec and eight
acres of the famous plains of Abraham,
Mrs. Caroline Lambert Campbell, wife of.
William A. Campbell, an assistant super
intendent of schools in Brooklyn, has en
gaged counsel to look after her case in
the Dominion courts. The property was
escheated for three ' generations by the
British Government in 1760.
In ISB7 the Privy Council refused a Joint
application . from representatives of the
Catholic church, the Church of England
and the citizens of Quebec asking that
$150,000 held by the British Government
and collected as rental should be equally
divided between the two churches In Que
bec. The Privy Council, with the assent
of Queen Victoria, decided that the heir
would in time appear and that the prop
erty and its usufruct from the time the
decree of escheat terminated, in 1865, be
longed to the heirs of Louis Joseph Lam
bert, who gave largely of his vast for
tune to the French In the French and In
dian war. When the English, conquered
he was deprived of his estates and those
of his wife, the Demoiselle Genevieve de
Villeray, who inherited 130 acres in Que
bec city from her father.
Mrs. Campbell claims descent from
Augustine Lambert, with whose life the
escheat ended. He had removed to \u25a0 the
United States, and after his demise some
of the heirs tried ; but failed to recover
the property. It is said by Mrs. Camp
bell that the' estate is entailed, bo the
most she hopes to secure isa life inter
est. On her death the claim passes to her
first cousin, Henry Lambert, president of
the 6rand Avenue National Bank of Kan

OTTAWA, Ontario, June 15.â The new
Allan turbine 6teamship Virginian has
the distinction of having made the trans-
Atlantic trip from land to land in 100
hours, breaking the Canadian record by
Dearly twenty hours. Andrew D. Allan
ffvys of this phenomenal trip: "The Vir-
Ctnlan left Moville on Friday, June 9, at
2 p. m.. and passed Cape Ray, New
foundland, on June 13. at 11 p. m., which.
allowing for the difference In time, gives
an elapsed time of 100 hours. She re
ported from Cape Ray to-day at 4 p. m.,
being detained by the fog, but I expect
her to arrive at Quebec to-morrow."
Allan, while confident that turbines
would break the record, was not prepared
for the news of to-day. The Virginian
has about ItSOO passengers. Â»

Evarts believes that 1 San Franciscfo is
going to get a big share. of the supply or
ders for â¢ the : Panama side. The distance
from New./' York , : and ; New v Orleans is
much less to\ Colon than fronV San Fran-"
cisco* td v Colon," "and- those 'seaports prob
ably will handle the Colon side traffic al
most exclusively." He believes the Gov
ernment -*wll. want .to land goods at tide
water 'and avoid 'transshipment;? either,
one- way or the other,' over> the Panama
Railway, which"- will be greatly taxed
when work on the canal Is commenced in
earnest. . \u25a0 . : /
The conference apparently was satis
f a'cTbry to" Schwerin and ' Evarts, and It
probably. will have; an important bearing
on Pacific commerce.'
President Roosevelt" assured his visitors
that jit was , the intention of ; the \u25a0 Govern
ment to '\u25a0 conduct the road strictly in the
interest' of : all classes "of shippers. â¢ The
Pacific Mail in'looking fora resumption
of; busiiness under an understanding, with
the Governments could not hope* to enjoy
a' monopoly fo the . Central ; and ; South
American traffic if other lines desired ' to
meet it in honest competition. No specific
contracts would be signed j with \u25a0 the â¢cor
poration.' ] :' _
It is understood that the^ President as
sured' Schwerin that there was nothing in
the way of the Pacific Mali; continuing to
do business as in the past/;' The only dif
ference would be brought "about by "the
adjustment of transisthmian rates, which
probably would be lowered.' \
Schwerin says that the Pacific- Mail
naturally will be aj bidder for Govern
ment freight for Panama canal construc
tion, ' both between ' : - San - Francisco "â¢ and
Panama- and Colon -and J New York. He
knows of no competitor among organized
steamship lines, but, of course, the heavy
shipments of - material will , bring , tramp
steamships and j sailing . vessels â¢ into the
battle for cargoes. :'::
, Schwerin was anxious to know : the feel-
Ing of the Government toward the. Pacific
Mail." Since, the. Government has had con
trol of , the Panama Railroad there has
been much- talk of an adjustment of rates
arid, the possibility of placing a Govern
ment J; steamship line, on' in* competition
with the Pacific Mail. '_.-. .

A CLEAN MAN.
Outside cleanliness, is less than half
the battle. A man may scrub himself a
dozen times a day, and
still be -unclean. ' Good
health means cleanliness
not only outside, but in-
side. It means a clean
stomach, clean bowels,
clean blood, a clean
liver, and new, dean,
healthy tissues and fi-
bers in every organ of
the body. The man
who is dean in this
way will loot it and act
it. He will work with
energy and think clean, clear, healthy
thoughts.
He will never be troubled with liver,
long, stomach or blood disorders. Dys-
pepsia and indigestion originate in
unclean stomachs. Blood diseases are
found where, there is unclean blood.
Consumption and bronchitis
mean unclean lungs. Dr.
Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery prevents these
diseases. It makes a man's
insides clean and healthy.
It cleans the digestive or-
gans, makes ' pure, clean
blood, and clean, _ healthy
flesh. It doesn't make the
flabby fat of corpulency,
but tire firm flesh of health.
It restores tone to the nervous system,
and cures nervous exhaustion and
prostration. .It contains no alcohol
to inebriate or create craving for injuri-
ous stimulants.
" Mr. John I*. Gougheoour, of Glen Savage,
Boa crsct Co., Pa., writes : VMy appetite was
nnusoelly poor, aad I was as weak and nerv-
ous as tnougti I had been starved for months.
My heart kept throbbing continually and I was
short of breath. Finally I wrote to you for ad-
. vice end you informed me that I had indigestion
'and a torpid liver. I did not think your diag-
nosis was right, bat I ordered six bottles of
' Golden Medical Discovery * from you and began
its ose. After using: three bottles I began to im-
prove slowly and soon went to work, and I have
been working ever since." \
Constipation is the most unclean un-
deanlinesa. Dr. Pierces Pleasant Pel-
lets core it. Tfcey never gripe. y ..

SAX RAFAEL. June 15. â Camp J.H.
Harris,- Veterans -of "the Spanish^ Amer
ican "War. was organized In tne Arm
ory last night with thirty-three mem
bers. The camp Is named after Cor
poral Harris, the first soldier of th% '
Eighth Regiment. National Guard" of.
California, to die during the Span-ish-
American war.
.; ..When \u25a0 the . merchants decided that it
was -useless . to keep the sprinkler go
ing the -."water wagon", man â¢, promptly
hunted ' : up . occupation. The
streets of lone now look like a road
In a desert and dust is everywhere. :
'lONE/Jnne 15.â The law prohibiting
the 'sale' of 'lntoxicating -liquors 'within
two'inttes- of * a" State 'lnstitution ha 3
made lone ' the' dryest " town rin the
State. 'Even the' streets are- "dry." \u25a0'
The Preston Reform School Is located
here.' .When* the ''law went" into- effect
a few weeks ago the* saloon-keepers did
not close up.Vbut-'they.'-stopped' selling
liquor and' handed out as thirst quench
ers all sorts of BOft drinks.'.-' Now,- the
average Ionlte" is not partial- 'to -such
stuff and in consequence the cash regis
ters of the saloon men did not ring- very
often. The reduction^ ; ia receipts
brought 'about a curtailment 'of ex
penses. The .first item cut off the list
was street sprinkling.
.The "water wagon" man received so
much a month from each merchant and
liquor dealer to keep the dust down.
When the . saloon men refused to pay him
he ; very . naturally shut off the water'
when he passed the* saloons. Soon the
main; street of the -town took on the
appearance of a checker board. "Wet
spots alternated with -dry spots, and, as
the' saloons â¢ are rather numerous In
lone, the dry â¢ goods . men . and others
soon: realized that 'the sprinkler : was
doing: little good.. \u0084 . ~ , . t

A curious feature of the case is that
on December Zt. 1904. May Traeey and
Nellie Lanigan were found- dead -from
asphyxiation In a rooming-house on
Kearny street, where they had taken an
apartment while intoxicated, and It was
Bessie Lanigan and Annie Traeey, both
inmates of a Kearny-street resort, who
made an ineffectual attempt to pro
cure enough money to bury the suicide.
Annie Traeey. a daughterl working
in a Kcarny-street dance hall, tried
all day. aided by a woman friend, to
raise enough mon*>y to give her mother
a decent burial, but returned late In
the evening unsuccessful. It seems now
that the coUDty will have to stand the
expense.
Apathetic tale of poverty and neglect-
Teas brought *o ligiitMn 'the -Vof&ue
yesterday, when Thomas J. Trace'y, the
husband of Mrs. Sarah Traeey,' refused
to pay the expenses of her burial, al
leging that he vras out of funds. MrÂ«.
Traeey became despondent and drank
carbolic acid in her honre at Ocean View
on June 14. and died at the Central
Emergency Hospital. The body has .re
mained unclaimed at the Morgue since
her death.

But the awakening came at last, and
noÂ«* the husband and wife have 'got to
gether aad the aunt in "whom she reposed
the greatest confidence she now de
nounces as a. robber, and the^ husband and
his young wife will endeavor to get back
the property they have lost.
OAKLAND. June 15.â Charging that
her marriage was but a part of a schem*
of her aunt to rob her future husband,
which act was finally accomplished, Lillie
Epaete, alter awakening to the fact that
she had been made the tool of a design
ing woman, according to a complaint she
filed to-day, has brought suit against her
aunt, Marie Kzsauer, to recover property
valued at $â¬335.
Mrs. Spaete sayc that she Is but 19
years of age. and unused to the ways cf
the world. She caiae to Oakland from
Chicago two years ago to live witii her
aunt and when Max Spaete was chosen
as a husband for her she acquiesced.
Wlien her aunt told her to persuade him
to buy some property at East Fourteenth
street and Eleventh avenue from her
aurt she did as she was bid, and was
so successful that Epaete gave Mrs.
Knauer $3OÂ» in cash for the property and
a promisscry note for $2XO more, secured
by a mortgage. .; ..Â»^ .;
The next step, it Is alleged, was to get
the husband to deed the property to his
wife, and after this was done, according
to Mrs. Spaete, hÂ«Â»r aunt incited such
trouble between the husband and wife
that Epaete, no longer able to live In the
house, left it., Then the aunt^ got Mrs.
Epaete to deed the property' to her. and
when this was done the girl was told it
would be best for her to go back to Chi
cago, and was Induced to give the aunt
JI2S worth of personal property as welL
Professor Mead t conceived the idea of
reclaiming hundreds "of thousand's o*
acres in the Sacramento by means of a
vast irrigation project, ' and he was
largely responsible for the trip to the
West of - tha Congressional Irrigation
Committee. He declared to-day that the j
Washington "officials ~ are being given
daily -a revelation regarding the possi
bilities Of irrigation, which eventually <
will redound to ' the b*Â»neflt of the West,'
when Government aid Is required to
carry forward the vast Irrigation pro
jects now proposed.
In the opinion of Professor Mead, the
irrigation question is the most vital one
before Calif ornlans, and will require the
aid of another generation to complete
all the reclamation work now under con
sideration. Because of this phase of the
matter, Mead regards the educational
work of the department of irrigation as
of " the â¢ utmost importance, and j entitled
to unusual consideration by the univer
sity authorities, jj
From the Sacramento Valley, Professor
Meade will go to the big dam at Hazen;
near Tmckee, where reclamation work
is being done on a gigantic . scale, with
thousands of acres of arid - land in
Nevada waiting the flood which later
will -be turned upon - them, making a
desert fertile.
Bernard Etcheverry, who comes from
the University of Nevada to take the
place of an associate with Professor
Mead, Is a graduate of the University of
California. He was the class medalist in
ISC2. He Is to succeed A- ; P. Stover, whose
resignation was accepted by the Regents
last Tuesday. Stover Is to work for the
Government in Eastern Oregon, where re
clamation projects are now being carried
out.
proceed with them into Nevada.-, and
thence eastward, to Washington. - He
will return to, California In November
and resume his work as professor of
Irrigation here.
BERKELEY. June 13.â El wood Mead,
chief or the Government's irrigation and
drainage investigations, who has acted' as
one of the party escorting the Congress
men and Senators through the State on
the investigating tour. of irrigation dis
tricts, returned to the State University
to-day, to confer with Professor Bernard
Etcheverry regarding the work of the
irrigation department ,of the universitj
during the coming year. Professor Mead,

WHEN the first itinerary of the Congressional Irrigation Com
mittee was announced, The Call pointed out the serious mis
take made in omitting a visit to the San Joaquin Valley. We
gave the reasons why the best irrigation in the world and its best
results, at Fresno and other points in the valley, were the pro
fessed pbjective of the committee, and if they were-omitted the tour
would fail of its. useful purpose. Since then the . itinerary was
changed through the efforts of the State Board of Trade, and the
committee has seen the wonders of irrigation about which it would
have been skeptical without the evidence of its own senses.
.After seeing it all, Congressman "Copper said that it was evi
dently the most complete method of irrigation possible, and that
it put California in the position of a world leader in that artificial
application of water to crops of all kinds... He did not regard it, as
necessary to discuss improvements in methods, but declared that
what had been seen inspired the zeal of the committee to simply ex
tend it over other areas. That is the effect which we expected
would be produced by the visit. The members of the committee
are vitally alert and observant. What can be seen at Fresno .in
spires the dullest apprehension. Â«Xo wonder, that it touched into a
blaze the enthusiasm of these gentlemen who have not a dull wit
among them. They know^much now about irrigation here, of; its
relation to climate, of its economies and -its economics, and we feel
better, afcou^ it than we did;when their itinerary proposed to omit
the greatest object lesson in irrigation in the world.
It was a great day for California, no less great -for the
dry and thirsty lands that will be ... transformed by irrigation. \lt

THE Equitable Insurance Company is the most conspicuous of
'the many instances in which, a 'humble financial foundation,
well and' wisely managed, has grown with the growth. of the
country until its resources are so interwoven into credit and enter
prise that its conduct, and condition concern the financial stability
of the whole country. When it is remembered that, following, a
period of great prosperity, the failure of a Western concern,, the
â¢Ohio Trust Company, -precipitated, the panic, of .1857, it is easily
sepn that an institution like the Equitable, if permitted to slump,
might plunge the whole country into a credit panic. There is evi
dence that the enormous resources of the Equitable were sought to
be used in the great stock wars of Wall street, and that they were
to used in the struggles of -railroad stock jobbers ,in their policy
of seizure of the leading railway lines of the country.
But the recent upheaval in the institution" was not caused di
rectly by these us^s of its enormous capital. That conflict started
in a 'high feast, given by the man who. controlled a majority of the
stock, and in the ensuing examination other facts were revealed
Which made a reorganization necessanf if the credit of the company
were to be preserved, and the interests of its policy holders pro
tected. It is gratifying that, with all the seeming profligacy *and s
reckless use of its funds in speculative enterprises, the credit of
the company was found to be good and its vast reserves so intact
that no policy holder lost confidence.
In order to maintain this condition a reorganization has been
â¢ made and Mr. Paul Morton has been put at the head of the com
pany. It is doubtful if an American can be found who unites the
highest business ability with -unimpeachable honesty to an equal
degree as does Mr. Morton. His career shows that; it is not nec
essary to have a training in Wall street nor in the financial cen
ters to -make a great business man. He was reared on the Nebraska
prairie, under the admonition of a father who was in all respects a
model of wisdom and honor. Rejecting the opportunity for a uni
versity education, the innate business faculty of the son led him
first to a subordinate desk in a railroad office, and from that foot
hold he went forward to the substantial control of the Santa Fe
system, which he resigned to enter the Cabinet of President Roose
velt. That public service he leaves now to take a position of greater
responsibility than the chancellor of any national exchequer in the
The matter of the Equitable was of such public importance
that the whole country feels a sense of relief that the company
passes into such control. In the board over which he presides there
has been another recognition of the value to great financial institu
tions of the element of personal integrity, in the' : *selection of Mr.
Cleveland as one of its members. An ex-President can render no
higher service to his country than by aiding in the maintenance of its
financial security and soundness. Mr. Cleveland accepts, the place
from a sense of duty. In his acceptance he describes the situation
with his usual terseness and clearness, by saying: "I cannot" rid
myself of the belief that what has overtaken this company is liable
!pen;tb other insurance companies and fiduciary organizations,
g as lax ideas of responsibility in places of trust are tolerated
r people. The high pressure of speculation, the madness of
iate business scheming, and the chances taken in new and un
1 enterprises, are constantly present temptations, too often
sful, in leading managers and directors away from scrupulous
r and fidelity to the interests of others confided to their care,
m'better afford to slacken our pace than to abandon our old,
standards of honesty; and we shall be safer if we regain our
bit of looking at the appropriation to personal uses of property
iterests held in trust, in the same light .as other forms of
he country appreciates that kind of talk and every man feels
in his property and his credit because this great financial in
passes into slicrr guardianship. It means that the light will
rused upon other similar institutions that have become obr
n suspicion, until they will all be purged completely of any
iccftitss elements that have grown up in their management. \\q are
all equally interested in this. It is one way and a powerful way *by
which* to avert or avoid panics, and to mitigate their severity when
they. come. Insurance companies are places of deposit for such sur
plus wealth of the country as is devoted to that form yf protection
of property or use of savings against the accidents and misfortunes
of life. They are all trustees merely, as much so asthe banks and
trust companies. The public has the same interest in\ their right ad
ministration and honesty of management. ,
The movement started by an extravagant incident in New York
and ending in bringing Morton and Cleveland into the Equitable
management will not be spent until the public has the certain as
surance that all similar trusts are in as safe hands.

The speaker dlrectly.lald many of the
evils of the present stage to. the effect
â¢of the adverse; influence, under which
American / society . exists. ' He classed
this as the age of materialism and com
mercialism, where art is sacrificed for
the lust of amassing great wealth.. The
sanctity, of the individual is not now
merely infringed upon; It is a thing un
known. Religious zeal' is decliningr,
and with; it the desire for a strictly
moral life. Instead of the theaters
leading civilization toward the high and
the noble, they are producing that Vila
class of play which the "people; pay to
see, but which hurries them along; the
steep descent of moral degeneracy.'
TELLS IÂ»ERSOXAIi RECOLLECTIONS.
It was with a great deal of pleasure
that the. audience listened to the happy
recollections of "the speaker of the days
when : he :. was the personal 'â¢â¢ friend lot
many of the old actors. He tookl ; his
hearers back with him to New York in
the middle of the last century and per
mitted them to listen to Edwin ; Booth
and ! others'; of the folk.^ He
brought them : through the days of Ad
ams and John McCullough and down to
ouT'Own Joseph Jefferson, upon whose
work he showered < praise -of , -unstinted
measure. .Then came his appreciation,
after he had expressed his .views on the
"burlesque, . the sensational ; drama, the
semi-nude musical 'comedy and the
vicious; problem^ play.", of the; modern
actors whose work was to him all that
any moral "or artistic person could wish
for/v Among these; he rated Ellen Ter T
ry. AugUÃtin Daly, Richard; Mansfield,"
Henry Irving, Blanche â¢ Bates, David
Warfleld and Mrs. Fiske.
Peter Robertson, the well known
San Francisco critic, introduced \u25a0Wil
liam Winter as "the , dean of our pro
fession and the greatest authority ,on
dramatics In the; world *'; to-day. " : \u0084M r.
Winter then expressed; his appreciation
of being so heartily- welcomed* in '\u0084 San
Francisco by so many people/ In speak-;
Ing of the remedy for. the evils 'recdfft
nized as present on the stage, .he said,
in part:
' Cynical levity and; unscrupulous ' commerce
with popular caprice are prominent; character
istics of our . people.- Everything ' U - made the
subject of Jeet. : Business methods are tainted
With indirection., ' Luxury is everywhere , prev
alent.. Manners are overwhelmed by .vulgarity. '
Refinement .is insulted . at - every ..turn. - The
book stalls teem with fiction that â¢ . is either
erotic delirium or sentimental rubbish. The
public is maddened with haste, and strife and
there is no - peace any where. ,
remedies: of .evils. â¢ -
Equally caustic -was his arraignment
~bt the French drama, the burlesque and
the new' problem play.^Thls latter,, he
said, "is an odoriferous morsel -and no
problem at all, merely a name to cover
the vile picture of an' immoral life.
Madame *Sarah Bernhardt, though I
will admit with a rare artistic skill,
pictured this perniciously hateful idea
of a woman whose mind* Is quickened
by 'all that is passionate j and' sensual,
which, I say, has the effect of forcing
that same Idea upon the men and
women- of thlc country." - ; 'â¢.- '' : ; :
The veteran , newspaper man spoke
with a directness thut marked him as a
man of courage. He bitterly, attacked
the theatrical" trust, branding: ' it as a
"monster hnvlns its. head In the City
of New York and ltÂ« serpentine, blood-
Mucklngr tentacle* twined around al
most every theater jin the ' * United
States. ThU odious creature Is an en
croaching: menace to.the cauÂ»^ of pub
lic morality." ;
Â§ Mr. .Winter carried the solid 'convic
tion of truth with him in ; all* he said.
A man well advanced In years,' white of
hair and mustache, yet erect despite
these marks of age, he at first seemed
frail, but when he turned with all the
strength of his powerful and vitriolic
control of larfguage upon the modern
tendency of degradation of the; stage
his appearance of age vanished and his
words snapped find j vibrated with the
stirring Intensity of youth. He left with
the audience the sharp ; impression of
one who has passed through- the sear
ing years of contact -with, .the evils of
the stage \u25a0\u25a0 without receiving a scar, of
one whose integrity and', professional
honor had been far â¢ above -possible
smirch, of a man who spoke with a
burning purpose, that purpose the ulti
mate education of the American people
to an appreciation of the play H which
seeks to protect and lead, not taint,- the
progress of civilization. .

Complains That Court Roasts
â¢ Him Without Provocation
at Every Opportunity
Detritus in the Uivers of
California Will Now Be
Tlioroughly Considered
An investigation erf the greatest im
portance to the mining industry of Cal
ifornia has been begun quietly by the
United States Geological Survey. The
significance of the matter Is Indicated
by the statement that every cause that
tends to deposit sediment in the rivers
of California is Immediately to be a
subject for inquiry and research.
ThÂ« Government has sent to Califor
nik G. K. Gilbert. He has just arrived
In response to the memorial adopted by
the California Miners' Association at
the annual meeting of that body last
fall, in which President Roosevelt was
esked to make an Investigation/
The motive that inspired the me
morial was hope that hundreds of mil
lions of dollars' worth of gold that is
now buried 4dly In the ancient river
channels of California may be rescued
by the hydraulic mining process, it be
ing held by the miners that such de
posits cannot be profitably worked by
dredging, drifting or by any process ex
cept hydraulicklng. As the hydraulic
miner has been restrained from dis
charging bowlders, gravel, sand, clay
and other matter in suspension Jnto the
navigable waters of the State, a sys
tematlo study of all existing conditions
was asked of President Roosevelt, to be
conducted by the United States Geo
logical Survey. The President, re
eponded favorably.
The points principally to be consid
ered in the investigation by G. K. Gil
bert, the Government's agent, will be
the most favorable sites for reservoirs
for water, whereby destructive floods
may be averted and the waters stored
for the benefit of agriculture, mining
and other industries; also the selection
of suitable tracts of waste land and of
the most suitable means whereby the
detritus from torrential storms may be
deposited on such waste lands, to re
claim them and convert them gradually
into lands suitable for forestry and
other agricultural purposes and at the
same time to remove from such streams
their burden of detritus.
President Benjamin of the'" California
Miners* Association is naturally much
pleased that President Roosevelt has
heeded the wishes of the California
miners and that the Geological Survey
has taken such prompt action. Presi
dent Benjamin has written letters for
Mr. Gilbert, addressed to prominent men
in California. 'and will in every way
facilitate the great investiga
tion. .
In addition to looking into the de
posits of detritus that have been occa
sioned by mining operations, the Geo
logical Survey will consider the natural
erosion and sedimentation of streams
that run through purely agricultural
sections in which there is no mining, it
being- held .jy the miners that if.
hydraulic mining should forever cease
these natural and unavoidable causes
would still continue, to the injury of
the farmer and of the navigable waters
of the State.
MUNICIPAL BUDGET
SIGNED BY MAYOR
His Honor Full}- Approves
Appropriations for Various
Public Improvements.
Boiling with suppressed anger. At
torney William' Tomsky emerged from
Department- 9 of the Superior Court
yesterday' morning and announced that
he would have the law on Judge Coffey.
"I have been> roasted in. public and pri
vate by Judge Coffey until 'patience has
ceased to be a virtue," said Tomsky to
a group of sympathizers, "and now I
purpose seeing" if there is not a Jaw
that will protect the bar from the sa
tirical shafts he hurls at every pos
sible" opportunity."
"How do you purpose Invoking the
law to stay the wit and stop the flow of
spleen of which you complain?" \u0084was, was
asked. i
"To-morrow, or the next day in any
event, I will appear before the Su
preme Court and ask for a writ of pro
hibition.' There is no law, written ;or
unwritten, nor is there a rule of the
court actual or implied, that gives a
Judge the right to exercise his author
ity, stand on his power to punish for
contempt If he is answered back and
verbally flay every attorney that dares,
oppose him in word or thought.
"There is no question that it would
be an unusual proceeding to move In
,the Supreme Court for a writ prohibit
ing a Judge of the Superior Court from
expressing his opinion if he adheres to
proper form, but there is a limit. There
is a law that protects the court from
overt acts of the bar, and it is my opin
ion that the law will protect the bar
from the thrusts of the court, and I
shall invoke it. This is not mere angry
talk; I mean what I say, and the Su
preme Court shall hear what I have to:
say."
So it is that warfare has again
broken out between Judge Coffey and
Attorney William Tomsky. The new
breach came about this way. . The
estate of Axel Gutsch was before the
court on a petition for distribution.
Tomsky came Into court and opposed
the petition oiijthe ground that he had
a claim against the estate that had
been rejected by the administrator and
it was the Intention or the claimant to
bring suit to recover.
Gustav Gutsch, a brother of the de
ceased, who appeared as attorney for
the administrator, , had much to say re
garding Tomsky's delay and requested
the court to proceed with the distribu
tion. ;\u25a0
"No matter what I would like to do,"
said Judge Coffey, < "l must keep in
mind what counsel say and do. They
come here with all kinds of peculiar
requests and when I take them to task
they rush to the Supreme Court, pre
sent things in their own light, and I
am taken to task. If you do not know
this to be a fact, I refer you to the case
of Tomsky against the Superior Court."
When Judge Coffey had concluded the
perturbation , of ; Tomsky's \ soul was
plainly manifest â¢ . ,
"That was a case in which Judge Cof
fey tried to take away from me a fee I
had earned," said Tomsky.. as soon as
he gained the corridor. "I went to the
Supreme Court and I won out. . But this
thing has got to stop now. Judge Cof
fey Is constantly questioning: the in
tegrity of the bar and running his court
as a kindergarten of ethics for the legal
profession. I shall apply for a writ
of prohibition, and that failing I shall
keep trying until I find a method that
will bring a long, suffering bar much
needed relief." ' ; -'
When he heard of Tomsky's threat.
Judge Coffey smiled. His armor is well
tried already in combats with members
of the bar that failed to see all wings
in his light! r/X'M
White Seeks Child* Custody.
M. J. White, secretary of the Society
for the PrevÂ«ntion of Cruelty to Chil
dren, has filed a petition asking the
Superior Court to summon Henry Pen
horan and wife to show cause why
they should not be punished for con
tempt of * court. Penhorhan'a wife was
formerly* a , Mrs. Jasperson, mother of
four children. Recently Judge Muras
ky ordered that the little ones be
placed in institutions, but Penhoran
and his ( \u25a0wife kept the custody of one.
Myrtle, and It is supposed they have
the child aboard the scow schooner
Modoct "For falling to deliver the
child Myrtle into the custody of the
court White asks that Penhoran and
wife 'be punished. '
DRIVES PICK THROUGH FOOT.â Peter
Conniff. one of the laborers employed in laying;
i jas main at Jackson and Dupont streets,
yesterday afternoon drove a pick through his
right foot.' He was taken In an ambulance to
the Waldeck - Sanatorium, where he will -â¢. re
ceive medical treatment at the expense of the
pas company. He lives at the City Hotel, on
Howard street. â¢ V'-V-i-
Mayor Schmitz yesterday affixed his
signature to the ordinance passed by the
Board of Supervisors fixing the expendi
tures of the city government for the next
fiscal year and making a budget of the
same.
The Mayor seriously considered the ad
visability of vetoing certain specific ap
propriations, but decided at the last mo
ment that such a course would be useless,
even should his veto be upheld, as the
money would elmply be made unavail
able. >;;":.; V
The Mayor approved the appropriations
for various Improvements aggregating
nearly $1,000,000, Including $350,000 for the
partial reconstruction of the Geary street
road by the city. While be conisders the
amount insufficient for a first-class road,
he believes another similar appropriation
text year will complete the system. ;
The Mayor took exception to the usur
pation by the Board of Supervisors of the
prerogatives of the Board of Public
Works in the matter of the appropria
tions for improvements. The Mayor is of
the opinion that the. Supervisors have
only the right to appropriate the funds,
and not to expend them, that right being
vested solely in the Board of Works.

More than likely you speak the same
'words yourself, and no doubt you ii feel
far from well.'?; The cause may be easily
.traced to some derangement of the fe-
: male organs which' manifests itself in
depression of spirits, reluctance to go
anywhere or do \u25a0 anything, backache,
bearingfdown pains, , flatulency,'- nerv-
ousness, sleeplessness, leucorrhcea.
These 'symptoms ' are i^but warnings
that there is danger ahead,* and unless
. heeded a life of suffering . or a serious
operation is the inevitable result. Jl^.i\

SUMMARY.
Stolen base*â Essick, Mitchell. Schlafley. '<
Householder Errors â Mitchell. Gochnauer,
Murphy. Two r base hitsâ Murphy, Wheeler, !
Ntalon, Mitchell. First base on errors â San
Francisco 3. Portland 1. First base on called
balls â Oil Whalen 4. Left on basesâ Ban
Francisco 7, Portland 5. Struck out By
Whalen 1, by Essick 8. Hit bjr pitcherâ
Schlaney. Double playsâ Schlaflty to Runkle;
\u25a0Whalen to Neal<.m. Time of gameâ One hour
thirty-five minutes. Umpire â Davis.
The Giants had a mottled looking ball
team with Bert Jones in right field.
Murphy in left and Pitcher Cates at
third. They played the game for. a
fair-ye-well and backed up Essick in
good style. The latter was there with
everything known to fool a batsman at
the right time, while Jimmy Whalen
was getting his. The Seals could not
drive out hits when men were on the
bases. They missed many a good chance
to get away with the glory on this ac
count. The score:
All went along beautifully till the
fifth, when Householder was on third
and Schlafley on second. They tried
to work a double steal, but . Householder
was caught one block from the pan.
He jumped right into Wilson and Parke
came back figtiting. He slammed Eddie
over the head a couple of times and was
ready to. bring the /haymaker over when
the rest of the bunch cut in and broke
up the fight. Householder was not there
with a comeback, either. Umpire Davis
chased 'em both and also levied a tax
of 5 on their heads.
iSchiafley ushered in the second lor
the Giants by getting a slap " in the
slats. McCreedie bingled out to right,
too fast for Joe Nealon to grab. Bis
Sic-Lean put Sclrlafley over with a wallop
to center. Cates forced McCreedie at
third. Murphy. however, was the man
behind a two-cushion shot that cleared
tae bases, and he had to wait only a
Ssiinute before Runkle brought . him
through. Essick could not make good,
but Mitchell tore one through that sent,
in the oUier run.

Maybe the rough going was some too
many Tor the Seals yesterday at
ation Park. They are not accustomed to
liaving prize-fights and other hoodlum
tiffairs held while they are playing tne
sxime. But it came to pass that Kddie
Householder. Cousin Parke Wilson and
Jake Atz were all banished, the. first two
for making waljops at each other and
the latter for using language unbecom
ing iin officer and a. gentleman. Score: \u25a0
Portland C, San Francisco 3.
If any of the fans in th^ house liked
old-time ball they had no reason to ask
for their money back. It was wallop
and souse and clout all the time, and
you never could tell who was going to
set away with the game till the last !
man was declared dead according to the
laws of the game. The Seals held the
lead for an inning, but figured as dan
gerous ones in every inning.
Uncle's tribe started it off with a' hot
foot in the first. After Spencer had
been stowed away, "Waldron was safe on
a boot by Mitchell. Wheeler then
ckmted one past short. Hildebrand came
through with a Texas leaguer along
the right field foul line, bringing both
men in. lrwln shoved one through to
right after Hilde had advanced on an
out, making it three for the Seals, all
ihty could get.
But the bad thing happened right
there.- Atz was too saucy in the way in
which he talked to Mr. Davis, and lie
lelt the field in company of a special
copper, after having a five, spot de
ducted from his hard-earned coin.
Cates was trotted over to third, and
Murphy consented to do the honors m
leit field. He turned out to be a hero.

PLEADS GUILTY TO BURGLARY.â WiI-
Iiam GrenninÃloh. alias William Smith; plead
ed guilty in Judge Dunne's court yesterday to
a charge of burglary. He will be sentenced
on "June 21.' He broke Into the house of O. C.
Olsen 603 Filbert street, on April 2.
There was a caucus or executive ses-.
sion of the. board before the regular meet
ing was called to order.- The president
said that topics of water front patronage
were not discussed by the Commissioners.
The chief engineer of, the;' commission
and the attorney of the' board were in
clined to grant the request, but the'preslÂ»
dent, Charles S. Spear, while admitting
that-the worlt-was urgent, was not con
vinced that an extraordinary emergency
such as me law contemplated was in
volved. He predicted that the labor
unions would object and cause trouble.
He remarked that the topic had been
discussed'by officers of the Water Front
Federation.- lux. Spear 6aid: "If we grant
this request we will be charged with
seeking to abrogate the eight-hour law."
Mr. Healy remarked that the mon em
ployed on the work of filling the cylin
ders with concrete were willing to work
overtime for the extra pay and . the
unions to which they belonged were also
willing that the work should proceed on
that basis. Serious danger to property
would result from winds and tides If the
cylinders were not filled. \ . -' -.
Commissioner Mackenzie' and Crocker
suggested that action should be deferred
in order to hear representatives' of the
Water Front, Federation.
Mr. Healy remarked that he would
withdraw' the application if there ' was
danger of the board getting into trouble.
He was anxious to complete the Impor
tant work within the time specified.
Consideration of, the. subject was post
poned for one week.
M. W. Coffey. James Bowlin and John
P. Rowe of the Hackmen's Union com
plained to the board that the "white line"
Â»at the ferry depot over which- hackmen
were j not allowed to - cross In soliciting
business was too far from the tide of
travel. It was asserted that persons
other than hackmen were permitted to
talk to travelers on the Inside.
The Commissioners agreed to look" at
the '.'white line" next Tuesday and see
what -could be done to meet the wishes
of the hackmen.
The 'eight-hour, law was discussed at the
regular meeting of the -State Board of
Harbor Commissioners - yesterday after
noon.\Healy,:Tibbitts'& Co.. contractors

In the face of present day demands for
ctility and economy the picturesque In marine
architecture Is rapidly disappearing. The
â¢pars of the modern eteam vessel, be she
freighter or passenger liner, are no longer
tall and eraceful. A few of the old timers,
â¢uch as the China, retain the masts and yards
of the day when any kind of a vessel was a
delight to the artistic eye. But these few. eur
vivors onjy Berve to Illustrate the difference
between the old and the new. The latest of
Pacific liners, the Minnesota, and Dakota, could
aot spread on the derrick poles which have
taken the place- of the traditional masts,
enough canvas to propel the steamships at the
modest pace of a knot an hour. The dipper
chips, once the glory of the merchant marine,
ar* being replaced by huge floating warehouses
like the Alaskan and Californlan of the Amer
ican-Hawaiian line. And now the wines of
thÂ« surviving clippers are being clipped In the
lr.tereÂ« of economy. The old ship Invincible,
now Â«n Puset Sound, will never again bowl
â¢Jong under a mountain of canvas. .She Is
In the hands of the riggers, who have taken
a contract to convert her Into a four-masted
schooner. Ehe is not the first of the . old
aristocrats of the sea to be . shorn of â¢ her
towering roars. It take* a smaller crew to
fcandie a four and after and for the deteriora
tion-in. artistic value the modern ship owntr
oares not a rap. The "schooner" Invincible
will have none of the Interest for the marine
artist that the "ship" Invincible held, but
when the comDarison is made in dollars and
cents it Is the schooner that looks best to
the collector of the dividend, who has more
to say in the matter than the man of art.
The Invincible was built in Maine in 1873.
When the Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Mariposa returns here on June 23 from
Tahiti seven ttateroonif will be added to her
already liberal pasfer.ger accommodations.
The Mariposa was virtually rebuilt for the
Tahiti run and in the reconstruction the orig
ins! number of staterooms was reduced on
the supposition that the trade would not de
mand the full complement- The trip to Ta
hiti however has grown in popularity with
tourists from all parts of the world and for
the voyage commencing July 1 every room has
been , taken and there is a waiting list over.
On this July trip the Mariposa will reach
â¢Tahiti in time for the celebration of the fall
of the BaFtile. the greatest event of the year
in the French island colony. Dusky chiefs
from the surrounding islands attend in their
war canoes and the natives on this day turn
themselves loose to feast and frolic as they
<Sid In tbe days before the white man ruled
the land. With the extra accommodations
the Mariposa will have room for more pas
sengers. It Is expected that every berth will
*c taken as this ig the most popular trip of
the year although it is always, summer at
Tahiti and on the way there and home again.

Th* Sydney brought ?S7 tons of cargo
and forty-seven passengers, among whom
were: '. 1
While in \u25a0 the Gulf of Tehuantepec on
the outward voyage. Louis Johnson, a
fireman, temporarily insane, jumped over
board. The liner stopped and a boat in
command of Boatswain Joseph Soto was
lowered. Johnson was picked up. Within
fourteen minutes of the time he signaled
the engine-room to stop the ship
Captain McLean again Flgnaled for full
speed and the liner, with the demented
fireman on board and the lifeboat back at
the davits, was again on her way. A
passenger who witnessed Johnson's leap
lost his head and undertook a little inde
pendent rescue work. He let go one end
of a lifeboat and sent it swinging in the
eir, scattering its contents on the placid
waters of Tehuantepec. The fact that
the passenger meant well and that Cap
tain McLean is a man of kindly nature
eevod th* volunteer life-saver much caus
tic criticism/" . â¢? ; ; -
The Pacific Mail Company's liner City
of Sydney. Captain McLean, which ar
rived yesterday from Panama and way
ports, was ordered into quarantine to be
fumigated. The passengers were released
and transferred to the tug Arabs, from
which they landed on the "Pacific Mail
wbarf. The death of John Orndorff, a
Ptefcrage passenger, on May 26 was the
reason for the vessel being: ordered to
Angel Island. Chagres fever was griven by
the ship's surgeon as the cause of death,
but the doctor, other officers and some of,
the passengers unite in declaring that
Orndorff died of fright.
Orndorff was 22 years old and a native
of Spokane, Wash. He was a miner and
went to Panama to work on the canal.
He was a cabin passenger on the steamer
Newport. He was a nervous individual,
and his fellow passengers on the New
port amused themselves by telling him
thrilling: tales of the awfnl mortality at
the Isthmus. They told him that the true
condition of affairs had been suppressed,
and that as a matter of fact every' other
man who landed at Panama was within a
few hours stricken with yellow fever. By
the time the Newport reached Panama
Orndorff Baw yellow fever germs in
everything he touched. Two days after
his arrival Orndorff boarded the City of

other member of a famous American
family goes to his long rest. Mr. Burr,
the son of Hudson Burr of Mount Holly,
was born at Milford, Del., in 1342. and was
a descendant of that, old Quaker stock
which came to the American colonies
with William Perm and settled in Penn
sylvania. â¢
. David fP. Burr, however, came West
while still a young man, and for many
years was engagedMn the Implement busi
ness in Chicago. Attracted by the ad
vantages of California, he came to the
Pacific coast soon after his- marriage to
Miss Susie Morelng of Dubuque, lowa,
where some of his . relatives are still re
siding
Mr. Burr died very suddenly of heart
failure on his ranch near Stockton, and
his many friends throughout the State
will mourn the loss of a staunch and true
gentleman, whose many virtues will live
long In their memories.
The deceased was the father of Mrs.
C. M. Miall of this city, wife of the local
marine insurance agent of that name.
David P. Burr Dlei.
Captain A. C. Freese died shortly be
fore midnight last night.
The deceased came to this city in
1552: Denmark was the place or ms
nativity. He was known to every ship
ping master who has entered this port
during the last fifty years. He was in
terested in the shipping business from
the moment of his arrival here. He
owned lines of coasting steamers, tugs
and ; freighting vessels. /
Captain Freese served for two terms
as Public Administrator, being elected
both- times by the almost unanimous
vote of the people.
\u25a0During the last few years his health
had failed considerably, but the illness
which brought [ his life to a dose was
of short duration. â¢ -\u25a0

CHICAGO, June 15.â Notwithstanding lower
prices at Liverpool, the wheat market here was
strong the entire session. ;At the opening July
was up u c to %c at 86Â«4c to Jj6%c. From the
start shorts were* active buyers. The attention
of traders to-day was directed mainly to the
yet undetermined character of spring sown
wheat. Weather In the Canadian Northwest
was diÃcouraging to traders on the bear side of
the market, freezing temperature ' being ' re
ported from some sections. Excessive moisture
was also, reported In that region. ' Predict'd
eastward spread of similar conditions was a
source of anxiety to shorts. In addition many
reports were received emphasizing the proba
bility of great damage to . the spring \u25a0 wheat
crop by rust. A partial corroboratlon "of the
bullish advices was found In . an . advance of
over 2 cents in the price of wheat at Minne
apolis. News from the Southwest was of such
a conflicting character as to make "shorts in
creasingly nervous. As the session advanced
the demand from that source became more and
more urgent. For July the highest point of the
day was reached Just before the dose the

Exchar.ee to-dcy fell to Â» j;Â«Â»- low record for
the scar, reaching oaly .133,400 shares. Burl
ceee wts at a ',<^- ebb threuEhout. and late in
the day inter^ft ir. the market was practically
abaadoseJ is favor of the day's racing event,
which attracted > large attendance of Stock
Fxchange members. The market was practi
cally barren of incident and the movement cf
pricee ecarcely perceptible, except for the In
evitable sagging tendency aue to inanim&tisn.
It it rsece subject of remark, however, that in
epite of ihe paralysis of th* o^.iiand for stocks
rriees do not lose ground tin the longer com
parisons. Thus the eharp advances made on
Saturday last have not b*en entirely lost in
the fubtequent reactions*, althourh the *r*Â«^
lttive attitude or. which that advance wan
taped has ba^n entirely altered. There was no
important development la afTaire to-day, but
eueh Incidents as occurred were not helpful to
values. Developments in the Equitable Life
affair *eem to be arrested pending the report'of
the State Superintendent of Insurance, and that
report :s awaited for forming definite conclu
eicns ca the sigr.: fiance of the changes pro
posed. London was a light seller in this mar
ket, and the depression in foreign markets was
attributed to the uneasiness over the outcome
of relations in Morocro between Germany,
France and Great Britain. British consols and
French rentes tvere down. London discounts
fcardened and sterling exchange at Berlin and
Paris declined. Paris renewed its demand on
the London market for (rood, and the rate for
French rhec,ups hardened slightly. No effect
was produced on the London market. The ar
rival at Seattle of the first of the Klondike
gold cf the waton *as commented on. The
train markets were influenced by reports of
unfavorable weather in the Northwest and this
was not helpful to stocks, although Its Influ
ence was slight, as shown by thfe meager sales
*nd emsW price changes of any stocks which
rn'ght be affected. The few wide changes were
ir stocks for which a narrow market exists at
eny tirm- and for which either bids or offers
Ere four.-! at this time only by wide variations
from nf-nilnal current quotations. With the
.'.jnrravauon of the dullness renewed complaints

decline :in prices. Berries .were plentiful and
weak, with prices tending downward, while

NEW YORK, June 15. â The 'market opened
quiet and steady and ruled w> until ; Theodore
Price came out with the announcement that
he had covered his shorts and taken the long
side of the market in the expectation of an
advance. The effect of this announcement
was .to excite the market and prices . soared
upward. Price's announcement is Very\lm-*
portant. as it practically leaves the'majket
without any strong opposition, on' the short
side and without any strong-, bear, leader.
Price has a very large following and would
not chance - r his position at this time unless
he had some good reason for so i doing. One
of the reports current this afternoon was to
the effect that a serious mistake . had - been
made by the last .Government report, which
gave the traders a decrease in acreage oi
11.4 per cent from last year and made . the
average condition 77.2; per cent. ; .

It was not a firearm, but an Implement

brandished in rude'and- threatening man
ner at Frank Williams and A;J: Hughes
(both colored) .while they were removing

his own experienced hands, and as it re
clined In the window of . his, chop suey

the cynosure .of almond, eyes, with hun
gering expression. A bait more tempting
to the celestial palate could hardly have
been conceived. After it was boiled the

Kelly was neither a Mongolian nor an
epicure, but no sooner did his gaze rest
upon the ham than a great longing to be
Its possessor seized his soul. He stood
among the blue-bloused, - watery-mouthed
throng upon the sidewalk, and while they
interchanged Jabbering - comment relative
to the succulence: of the exhibit he was
devising a feasible plan whereby it might
become his own! 1 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0
"Wid all i dese. chinks erbout," he. said
to the gentleman j with ] whom -he had
started . to saunter by command of the
official guardian ; of Portsmouth square,
"et'd be a sure pinch fer any mug wot'd
try ter lift it. Ef youse start dat dog
fight racket uv yours en git dese heathens
away fer a mlnit I'll make . de dash." .
The dogfight . ruse was .attempted by
Mr. : Kelly's friend, and his vocal imita
tion of. two canines in sharp conflict, per
formed in a near-by alley, distracted pub
lic attention from the ham, even" to- the
extent ;of clearing the sidewalk. Wong
Hing himself would doubtless have par
ticipated in the stampede if thought of
the ham had not struck him just as he
reached his door, and as he stood there
with "envious gaze fastened upon the
scurrying crowd ' Kelly made his "dash."
He glided into the shop, picked up the
ham and was in fair way to escape with
it when his evil genius j prompted Wong
Hing to transfer, his gaze to the window.
