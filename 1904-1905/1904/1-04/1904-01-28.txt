of the Southern Pacific from San

closely guarded by agents of the
Southern Pacific and Pinkerton
detectives. Thirteen detectives
have been in Fresno for the last

The wreck of the Owl train at

Says Bag of Gold Must Be Thrown
Where Red Light Shines.
Every possible precaution has been
taken by General Manager Krutt
schnitt and Manager Agler at this end
of the company's system to maintain
secrecy in the matter, they fearing
that the slightest publicity would not
only be a warning to the blackmailers,
but would seriously interfere with pas
senger traffic between this city and
Los Angeles. It was overzealousness
on the part of the chief officer of the
company, however, that caused the
story to leak out and its confirmation
was readily obtained from reliable
sources, notwithstanding General Man
ager Kruttschnitt's refusal to enter
into a discussion of the affair.
Several days ago, when the officials
of the company began to realize that
life and property on their California
lines were being jeopardized, they sud
denly called in all the detectives along
the various divisions and put them to
work on tluTcase. Then Superintend
ent Burkhalter hurried north from
Fresno and had a conference with Gen
eral Manager Kruttschnitt and Man
ager Agler, and their decision was that
the detective force should be increased.
About that, time Detective.MacFar
lane, superintendent of the Western
agencies of the Pinkertons, was re
ported to be on his way to this city
on a tour of the coast offices, and he
was promptly advised to come direct
to San Francisco. MacFarlane is re
garded as one of the shrewdest men In
his business In the United States, and
as a representative of the Pinkertons,
with whom be has been employed for
many years, he has gained consider
able experience with all classes of men
suspected of being in plots to force the
bigr railroad companies to give up gold,
under penalty of suffering great losses
by the blowing up of their trains.
MOBILIZES DETECTIVES.
MacFarlane, it . is said v selected a
large .number of the most~c6uraEreous
men from the different coast agencies
of the Pinkertons and had them hur-!

their services could be quickly utilized

from Fresno stated that General Man

of reports received here to the effect
that the different bands of detectives,
employed in the hunt for the men sup
posed to be at the bottom of the plot
to blow up a Â¦ Southern Pacific train,
were ' clashing on the question of au

SOUTH BEND, Ind., Jan. 27.âBe
cause of the experiment of Dr. J. W.
Hill, one of the leading physicians and
surgeons of Indiana, to prevent Infants
born of negro parents from reverting
back to the old type of the negro race,
attention of the scientific world will be
fixed upon South Bend during the next
few months. All arrangements have
been completed for Dr. Hill's soluticn
of the color scheme of the human race.
An expectant mother has consented
to ret as patient and will enter the
hospital as soon as the rooms are fin
ished in the manner necessary for the
scientific event.
According to Dr. Hill, the negro's
skin is more sensitive than that of any
other human being and for that reason
more pigment is thrown out to protect
him under the climatic conditions in
which his forefathers were born, the
intense heat of the tropics making this
necessary. By preventing pigmenta
tion, the doctor believes, a -hild of
negro parents, which is generally born
whiU, turning darker under the sun's
rays, will become even whiter than the
Caucasian race. This follows the idea
of Dr. Feson, a Norwegian scientist,
who found that by putting a chameleon
under violet light rays the pigmenta
tion, or throwing oft* of color, was net
of such marked extent as under ordi
nary white rays. For this reason red
light ra; r s willbe employed in making
the experiment, for the reason that
they have a subduing effect and are not
rays that irritate and prevent pigmen
tation.

ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 37. -Jl very
extraordinary piece of news is given
me .and is of such a sensational char
acter that, unless I were assured over
and over again by a person in the very
best position to know that it is so. I
vould hesitate to prive it publicity.
. You "will remember how some time
Â£go I told you Russia was anxiously
watching Germany, with the view of
knowing what that country would do
In. case of war becoming extended, it
being well known that Russia's Teu
tonic neighbor had some very definitely
vorkfd out theories for expansion and
territorial aggrandizement when oth
ers are exhausted by fighting. It would
seem, according to my informant (a
man whose position would infer knowl
edge upon the subject) that an agree
ment had been entered into between
Germany and Denmark, whereby, in
the event of England being drawn into
a war v.itb Japan against Russia.
Germany should immediately ma..e a
friendly occupation of Copenhagen
with a powerful force, thus effectively
closk.g the Baltic and preventing Rus
eia going out or the English coming in.
GERMANY'S POSSIBLE GAIN*.
TV - arrangement Germany made
vrith Denmark is easily imagined upon
the basis of the Schleswig-Holstein and
also the Cumberland family arrange
ment.
TVhi!e every one who is at all behind
Kaiser Wilhelm's ambitions knows the
terrible avidity with which, in view of
German's meager sea line and harbor
accommodations, he views the possi
bility of the already Germanized Rus
sian harbors, Riga and Reval. being I
ceded by or demanded from exhausted ,
Russia in return for vitally useful pro
tection at a critical period. In the in
evitable partition of China, which must
take place in case of war, Germany as-
Eigns herself the Peking provinces. The
Germans have recently advised the
bui'.ding of another fort to better pro
tect Copenhagen, this to be done under
their supervision.
Concerning the foregoing agreement
and the probability of the same, atten
tion may be drawn to the recent for
mal visit of the Kaiser to Copenhagen
with Count von Bulow, the subsequent
official visit of the -Crown Prince to
Denmark, and the fact that the Kaiser
remained at Potsdam especially to
greet the King of Denmark, with
Count von Bulow again present. This,

POMONA. Jan. W.
Keown, who has been posing here aa
a wealthy owner of timber land in Brit
ish Columbia some sixty miles east
from Vancouver. Is wanted by the po
lice in Pomona. He I3 accused of big
amy in addition to deserting his brida
after swindling her out of $7000.
Keown is a tall man. dark coraplex
ioned. has black eyes and hair and is
about 43 years old. He and his bride,
who is a beautiful woman of 35 years,
came to Pomona from Lincoln. Neb.,
last October. Keown talked of the pros
pective sale of his timber lands for
$175,000. and had Dlans drawn for a
mansion among the orange groves and
roses of Pomona Valley. He leased the
ground floor of the Ruth block here
and fitted it up for a grocery. On De
cember 1 he started ostensibly for San
Francisco to buy a stock for his new
store. On December 8 he wrote from
San Francisco that he had heard there
had been a fire in his timber in British
Columbia and that he was going to
Vancouver to see about it. "When
Christmas came and nothing more was
heard from him. his wife became
alarmed for his safety, and inquiry
into his affairs showed that he had
never deposited the $7000 she gave him
to deposit in a Los Angeles hank. She
also found that he had been in com
munication with an unknown woman
at Santa Barbara and had posed as a
widower who was in love with her.
The woman, it seems, had but $4000.
that she said she -was going to give
Keown as her wedding present to him.
The local police were notified on Janu
ary 10, and they have since been se
cretly looking up clews to the where
abouts of the missing Keown. It 13
known that he met the strange woman
in Santa Barbara and they went to
San Jose together. From there the
police cannot trace them. Meanwhile
the police have ascertained that Keown
was known as Thomas Phelps in Law
rence, Kans., where he wedded a Miss
Stella Ferm in May, 1900, and after
securing $4200 which she had saved hs
a schoolteacher he disappeared. Pho
tographs sent from Pomona to Law
rence were Recognized as those of
Phelps.
Mrs. Keown has been left penniless
among strangers. When The Call re
porter called upon her at her home to
night she showed the effects of long
weeping and anguish.
"I was married simply for the $3000
that I had." said she. 'TVe met in
Lincoln last May, and he made violent
love to me from the first. "We were
married last June, and from that day
until Keown left for San Francisco he
schemed to get my every dollar. He
had my full confidence and I believed
he was a rich man temporarily embar
rassed. That he is a bigamist several
times over I have not. the least doubt."

DYNAMITER DEMANDS $10,000 FROM SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY,

A BLACKMAILER, with the terror of dynamite as the force behind his threats, is trying to rob
the Southern Pacific Company of $10,000, and fear of death vto passengers and wreck of property
on the road between Stockton and Los Angeles holds the corporation officials in nervous dread.
Night and day lynx-eyed Pinkertons, railroad detectives and county sheriffs and their deputies are
keeping watch along the Jonesome stretches of track where the dynamiter, through letters mailed at
Fresno, says he will use the agent of destruction that is his ally unless he receives the money de
manded. â¢ After the method used by Gravelle, the- notorious Montana wrecker, a red light is to flash
in the night as the train bearing the treasure goes by and the bag of gold is to be flung out beside

ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. 27.â
Prince Tarkhanov, the scientist, lec
turing before the Military Association,
made some interesting statements in
regard to the possibilities of radium.
He presented two cancer patients
who had been cured of malignant
growths on the face by the use of ra-"
dium, and expressed the opinion that
the problem of determining the sex
of children, which Professor Schenck
had claimed to have solved, will short
ly be settled by the aid of radium.
When large Quantities of radium
were available, the Prince contended,
the whole system of modern warfare
would be revolutionized, as powder
magazines, whether in forts or in the
holds of vessels, would be at the
mercy of radium rays, which could ex
plode them at long distances.

OMAHA, Nebr., Jan. 27. â After a
telegraphic search in towns across the
continent along the lines of the Union
Pacific, the Milwaukee and the Penn
sylvania railroads, the officials to-day
found the lost body of Mrs. Otile
Haupstuck's husband in the bottom .of
one of her trunks. The officials had
believed that the body was shipped
the usual way in a pine box. They
found instead it -had been cremated.
What thejl supposed was a package of
metal polish was the man's ashes.

"The detectives engaged in watching
for. the /men who were threatening to
blow up a train were the first to fur
nish Information regarding the express
car robber. They could have arrested
him themselves, but dared not do so,
knowing that such a move would ex
pose their identity and possibly spoil
the plans for unearthing the m5h want
ed in the other and more important job.
"Torday the company has "its line
well patrolled and its anxiety over the
wrecking of any of its trains has di
minished rapidly, It is evident that
the men involved in the job have seen
the danger ahead and have abandoned
their plans for at least a time. This
conjecture is strengthened by the fact
that they did not carry out their
threat to blow up a train to-day."
B. A. Worthington, assistant to the
general manager of the Southern Pa
cific and former superintendent of the
coast division, with which he. Is very
familiar, departed rather suddenly
from this city yesterday. It, was given
out at the general offices that he had
gone on an inspecting tour of ' the Og
den division, but later in the day it
was learned that he has been intrusted
with certain details of the- plans /for

WORTHINGTON DEPARTS.
The unusual, activity- of. the
sleuths, followed by the remarked
excitement in the general offices of
the Southern Pacific Company during
Uie last week, resulted in the' facts of
the attempted blackmailing plot finally
gaining publicity.
It was stated on authority of one
of the highest officials of the railroad
company last evening that the detec
tives working on the case in the south
have, during the last ten days, inves r
tigated the character of every man of
a criminal nature who 'has arrived in
Fresno and the neighboring towns, and
not a few of them are regarded in the
light of men who would readily enter
into any daring plot. In fact; it is said
that Southern California has . never
been infested with a greater number of
dangerous men than at the present pe
riod. They have been driven West
with the tramps and hoboes by the ex
tremely cold weather and have been
traveling with the latter in order to
attract the least attention from the au
thorities.
"Pinkerton men," said the railroad
official, "have under the guise of tramps
mingled with these gangs and have
been able to closely watch those who
might engage in the blowing up of a
train. Of course! the detectives have
had their stool pigeons in the same
crowd, and it was this fact that led to
the pjJbmpt arrest of the man who
robbed the express car of- the limited
train just this side of San Bernardino
last week.
also put aboard the trains to. if pos
sible, detect any Eastern robbers en
route to ' the possible scene of the
threatened train wrecking. For
months the Pinkerton forces have
been working on a similar case for
the Great Northern and during that
time they have held up a number of
men who-may have since journeyed
west to this State and undertaken the
present plot to mulct the Southern Pa
cific Company. The possibility of
some of these men being in this city
prompted thd local agency of the
Pinkertons 1 td "keep a blose watch on
the hotels, public resorts and the red
light district of the city.
' The detectives are maintaining the
strictest secrecy, although it was
learned from a good source last even-
Ing that half a dozen men, known by
their crimes to the Pinkertons, have
been under the surveillance of the
representatives of that agency in this
city since Monday a week ago.
EXCITEMENT IN OFFICES.
W. B. Griffiths, manager of the Cole
man ranch, in Berryessa Valley, read
of the case in The Call and noticed that
the description of the wife Involved
tallied with that of a woman whom he
had lately employed as cook on the
ranch.! Upon being confronted with the
story she admitted she was Mary A.
Small and that John Grant was work-
Ing In a near-by woodchoppers* camp.
Grant immediately disappeared, and it
is thought he started to "walk to Napa,
a distance of twenty-five miles. On
January 11 Mrs. Small departed on the
stage for Napa and arrived 'here at
noon of that day. From that time no
trace 'of her or her paramour 'can be
found.

In the boldest of terms the
writer proclaimed that if his de
.nands were not complied with he
would wreck every train running
between Stockton and Los An
gtles by the use of dynamite.
It was this second letter that
stirred the railway people to
action, and the conclusion was at
once reached that the Yolta
wreck was the work of the author
or authors of the threats. The
letters were turned over to the
co vipany's detectives, but the case
was deemed important enough to
warrant the employment of out
side help, and the sen-ices of the
Pinkerton Detective Agency were
obtained.
In order to draw the would-be
blackmailers out, if possible, n
peculiar advertisement was in
herted in the San Francisco dail
ies on January 16, reading as fol

headquarters. This letter was far
more explicit than the first. It out 1
lined a plan, by which the money
was-to be paid over to the writer.
This plan said that between Jan
nary 14 and jo a light engine
should be run through the valley,
carrying with it a sack containing
Sio,ooo in five, ten and twenty
dollar gold pieces. Somewhefe on
the- run a red light would be
shown, and at that point the sack
was to be thrown off. The rail
way company was to signify its
acquiescence, and the day on
which the train was to be run bv
the presence of suspicious char
acters.
Trains running in and out of
Fresno have had armed "men
aboard as guards and the train
men themselves, while not know
ing exactly what was up, have
been aware that either a hold-up
or an attempt to wreck was ex
pected. For the last ten days,
too, every train has come into
Fresno from* a half hour to an
hour and a half late and the sup
position is that they were running
slower than usual because pf fear
of the wreckers.
Last night the Pinkerton men
were reported to be out' with the
trains, for yesterday was the ddy
set for the time limit and a more
than usually close guard of the
track was kept.
None of dhe railroad people,
the Pinkertons or Sheriff Collins
will talk of the matter at Fresno,
though they admit its truth and
deplore the fact that it has leaked
out. From another source it is
learned that for a time suspicion
rested on VV. S. James, an ex
convict and train robber, who
was several weeks ago arrested on
suspicion of complicity in the
Oregon Railroad and Navigation
Company hold-up last Septem
ber. He proved his innocence of
that charge, but he has been here
ever since and is not deemed by
the authorities above train
wrecking. Suspicion against
him, however, seerris so far to be
groundless.
A theory was advanced to-day
by an interested party thft the
letters were written in another
town and* 15roughtr> here to /be
mailed, and it would notjbe sur
prising if similar, letters were re
ceived from some other city..
ing indication in some other
way."
This advertisement was dis
played in the regular advertising
columns, and as cai\ be seen was
intelligible only to the writer cf
the letter. A few days after its
â¢publication a third communica
tion, also mailed in Fresno and
addressed just the same as the
first two, was received, which
stated that the time would be ex
tended to January 27, but that the
terms and signals suggested in
the previous communications
must be strictly adhered to.
Since then Fresno has swarmed
with Pirrkerton men, who have
been assisted in their work by the
Sheriff's deputies, the police de
partment and several private de
tectives. A watch has been kept
for another letter and detectives
have hung around the postoffice
night and day. The mail boxes
in the business section of the city
have been guarded just as closely,
and some in the residence section
have been watched. The men
have worked in relays night and
day. The Fresno postoffice clerks
and officials as well have been_cm
the lookout, but the letter writer
seems to have taken warning, for
no further communications have
been received.
ARMED GUARDS OX TRAIN'S.
The letters have caused much
more to be done, however, than
the employment of a corps of de
tectives. For ten days past the
track of the company from Stock
ton to Los Angeles has been pa
trolled bv Pinkerton men, who
have been stationed at intervals
of about three miles and who, it
is said, have a way of signaling to
each other in. ca^e they should

SAN LUIS OBISPO, Jan. 27.âDe
tective White returned from Santa
Barbara this afternoon and says there
is no truth in the report that Walter
McGuire, the Wells-Fargo burglar sus
pect, is a relative of the prominent
McGuire family of Santa Barbara. Not
withstanding the statement of the de
tective, Mrs. Manderscheid of this city,
who went to school in Santa Barbara iu
1875, says she knew a Walter McGuire
there then who was a son of the then
Superior Judge of that county. So
strong is the resemblance between the
picture of the suspect ana the McGuire
boy she remembers that fhe remarked
that "this looks like McGuire" before
she had read the alleged identification.'
It is now known that on the day
of his arrest the suspect called at the
roundhouse and inquired for Master
Mechanic W. S. Templeton, now of Sau
salito, who was chiefly instrumental in
McGuire's identification. The two were
well acquainted. McGuire wrote a let
ter in the presence of Detective
Thacker yesterday, the substance of
which was instructions to keep the
children, presumably those of a sister,
from reading the newspapers, as ,he
always thought much of them and they
seemed to think a great deal of him.

SAN LUIS OBISPO, Jan. 27. -The
need of being on the right side of the
quarantine line is getting to be a se

county, and more particularly so to the
counties next southâSanta Barbara
and Ventura. The dryest winter sea
son by half since 1869. when the first ac
curate reports were kept, up to 1837 was
1886-87, when 3.66 inches of rain had
fallen up to February 1. In the other
seasons before and since 1887 from two
to six times as much rain has fallen.
The year 1887 was a good one, as nine
inches of rain fell during February and
C.b'O inches later. This year only 1.90
inches of rain have fallen to date.
These figures show the actual condi
tions in this community and in Santa
Barbara and Ventura counties there
has been scarcely an inch of rain, and
that has fallen within ten days.
This condition of affairs has called

STOCKTON, Jan. 27. â Registrar
Maxey of the United States Land Of
fice was to-day notified by the depart
ment at Washington that 40,000 acres
of land, withdrawn from entry De
cember 24, 1902, and since held as
forest reserve, was reopened and
made subject to regul- homestead
filings. The land lies on the Yosemite
side of Mariposa County and is
traversed by the Merced River. It lies
directly along the route of the recent
ly surveyed Yosemite railroad, and for
which rights of way were secured re
cently by application to "Washington.
A portion of the land is rocky and
rough, but there are said to be some
good stretches, and all makes a fair
range. With a railroad traversing it
a rapid settlement of the section is
possible. It is thought that the rail
road people have used their influence
to secure the withdrawal of the land
from the forest reserve.

SAX MATEO. Jan. 27.â Phil M.
Roedel, founder, cashier and chief
owner of the San Mateo Bank, died
this -morning at his beautiful home in
El Cerrito Park, after an illness ex
tending over a period of two years.
Roedel was 46 years of agre and a
native of Chicago. At an early age
he removed with his parents to White
Cloud, Mich., where his father en
gaged in the banking business. The
elder Roedel had served as Indian
agent to New Mexico previously under
President Grant, whose personal
friendship he enjoyed.
Removing to San Mateo in 1894, the
younger Roedel founded the San Ma
teo Bank and became its cashier. He
was the owner of five-sixths of the
stock of the bank, but his death will
not in any way impair its financial
standing. He also had extensive real
ty holdings in Michig-an and possessed
a fortune of half a million dollars. He
was married about twenty-six years
ago to Miss Minnie G. Gibbs of White
Cloud, Mich., who, with three chil
dren, survive him. The children are
Charles A. Iloedel, teller in the San
Mateo Bank, and Misses Clara and
Alice Roedel, the latter a co-ed of
Stanford University. A sister, Mrs.
Miles Standish, is the wife of the
millionaire millman of Oakland. The
funeral services will be held on Friday
afternoon at 3 o'clock, and interment
will be in St. John's Cemetery, this

PARIS, Jan. 27.â Official advices re
ceived here from St. Petersburg show
that Foreign Minister Lamsdorff, be
fore giving Russia's answer, has called
in Japanese Minister Kurino. The two
Ministers are now conferring with the
view of so shaping the response as to
avoid a conflict. This is considered to
be an explanation of the dispatch from
Tokio saying Japan has requested Rus
sia to hasten her reply. As Lamsdorff
and Kurino are having conferences
prior to the submission of the reply,
it is regarded as evidence of Japan's
insistence upon an early answer and
of Russia's desire to avoid a response
which might precipitate hostilities.
Count Lamsdorff's course in conferring
with Kurino before answering is cited
as showing Russia's .= willingness to go
to the last limit in order, to avoid war.
But, it is added, if the efforts of Russia
fail she will be prepared to strike very
hard blows from the outset.
All information reaching the highest
quarters here tends to show that the
crisis continues acute. It appears to
be the accepted conviction in Govern
ment circles that the final determina
tion between peace and war cannot be
long deferred. The officials continue
to hope for peace, but they make the
reservation that the discouraging as
pect which the situation has assumed
during the last few days has not been
ameliorated.

The bunko artist, who travels undar
the name of Leggett, represented him
self as a horseman from Kentucky with
an inside track on the purchase of
thoroughbred stock. "He soon gained
the confidence of his victims and pro
posed a scheme. It was to form a com
pany and purchase a few high-grade
stallions with records of- 2:25 or better.
He had, he said, knowledge of where
two such animals could be secured for
J3C00. The local stockmen readily en
tered into the scheme and handed over
checks for the amount demanded. The
stranger conducted the negotiations by
wire and within a few days received a
telegram from Lexington that the
horses had been shipped. In due time
a bill of lading came along. Then the
victims of the plot were fully convinced
that they ha4 secured a great bargain.
The day before the animals reached
Blackfoot the manipulator of the deal
faded from sieht.
When the stock car arrived the local
men were on hand to receive their high
priced steeds. But instead of high
stepping thoroughbred stallions the car
contained a couple of old skates that
had to be vigorously beaten to make
them move. The animals are worth
about $3 each. Efforts to apprehend
Leggett have failed.

Special Dispatch to The Call
PORTLAND. Or. Jan. 27. â A num-
I'pr of recent articles in Eastern pub
lications have placed Oregon in the
doubtful column so far as Its antici
pated support of Roosevelt -was con
cerned. The skepticism of these writ
ers was due to the open attack made
upon the President last spring by Sen
ator Simon, who charged him with
breaking a written promise and pro
duced a letter to substantiate the
charge. The accusation was publish
ed widely throughout the country at
the time and coupled with the knowl
edge of Simon's political power in this
State it produced an Impression that
although Oregon has always been
overwhelmingly Republican, it might
very possibly oppose Roosevelt's nom
ination in the approaching National
Convention.
This Senator Simon emphatically
denies. In two interviews, given out
on two consecutive days, he has as
serted that he will make no fight
against Roosevelt and that he will not
himself be a candidate for the United
States Senate.
"I have no fight to make against
President Roosevelt," said Simon,
'and will make none. Among my as
sociates are to be found some of the
most ardent supporters whom the
President has in Oregon. I believe
that Roosevelt will be nominated and
elected."
As no opposition to Roosevelt could
reasonably be expected to exist in any
* political quarter in this State, save in
the camps of the Simon faction, the
.rote of the Oregon delegation un
doubtedly will be polled for the pres
ent occupant of the White House.
Simon's withdrawal from the Sen
ntorial race was made, it is said, for
the purpose of gaining political
strength. A number of interests are
opposed to the domination of the
Mitchell machine, but were reluctant
to tide with Simon, as they thought
.he would be unable to accomplish
much for the State if returned to the
Senate, and in spite of the assertions
of Pinion's friends that he would not
Accept the toga if it were offered to

lieved he would. His printed denial
sets these doubts at rest and the bat
tle for political supremacy in Oregon

j.rimary promises To be exceedingly

Giwk Theater Furnishes Theme for

BERKELEY. Jan. 27.-A visit to the
new Greek Theater furnished William
Butler Yeats with a theme for his ad
dress before the students of the uni
versity this afternoon. The peer of
Irish poets caught his inspiration from
a glimpse, of that monument of West
ern enterprise and spent most of his
hour comparing the stage of to-day
with the stage of yesterday, a century
ago, twenty centuries ago. With the
brush of his poetic -temperament he
painted a sc-rry. picture of the decad
ent, worm eaten drama that refined
people refuse to entertain, and then, as
a sort of relief from that present day
tragedy, glossed' it over with a new
one of the histrionic revival that' is
going on in Ireland, the fruit of the
work of a little band . of intellectual
patriots.

William Butler Yeats. artiFt, author,
poet, orator and famous on two con
tinents as a leader in the Celtic revival,
t-mertained a laree audience at the Al
hambra Theater last night. The repu
tation of Mr. Yeats had preceded him,'
and many were turned away from the
doors of the theater without being
given an opportunity to see or hear the
distinguished speaker. Mr. Yeats Is an
accomplished orator, and h<> held the
attention of his audience from the mo
ment of his appearance on /the stage
until ho gracefully bowed his adieup.
In an entertaining: manner he told of
the struggles of Ireland for freedom
and of the patriotism of the Irish race,
illuminating his talk with trite anec
dotes and quotations from the earlier
Irish poets.
The speaker was introduced by the
Itev. Philip O'Kyan, who spoke in
i>art as follows:
â¢â¢Th<? Irish race has always been
nbltged to fight for its existence, and
it Is little wonder that we have no
poets. There is one man who gathered
up the folk lore and put it into song,
the man whom I have the honor to in
troduce this evening, the poft of the
tvntury, William Butler Yeats. 1 '
Mr. Yeat3 stepped upon the platform
and was gieeted with a storm of ap
plause. The whole tenor of his address
WES in favor of a revival of the Gaelic,
his argument being that a people with
out a language will not stand together
as will the people who have not only
the ties of blood but also a common
tongue. As he summed it up finally,
"Gaelic Ireland is the Ireland of the
centuries; English Ireland is the Ire
land of the decades."
Mr. YÂ»ats' address was in part as
follows:
TI1KV IX>VE AMERICA. ,
Mr. Yeats' closing lecture will be
given Saturday night, when he will
speak on the revival of the Irish thea
ter.
Prior to the lecture a brief pro
gramme was rendered. Miss Haxel
Buckley recited "Father Gllligan," one
of Mr. Yeats' poems, in an entertaining
manner. Caro Roma rendered "Kath
leen Mavourneen" and oth<>r Irish bal
lads, and the Elks' Quartet followed
with "Eibhlin a Ruin."
Mr. Yeats concluded his address by
saying that he hoped for a day of uni
versal peace., but for the present there
Is nothing for people like himself to do
but take the platform and urge the
people to learn to speak Irish that Ire
land may once more be a free and in
dependent nction.
instance we find that as soon as a little
village in Ireland takes up the old
Gaelic songs the English shoddy goes
out and the good old Irish frieze come3
in. I am happy to say that Gaelic
grammar is being more and more
taught and that children coming home
from school aÂ«k their mothers if Irish
is not the language spoken in heaven."
The speaker then read what he said
he considered the bitterest invective he
had ever heard against England. It
refers to England as having a cold
heart and having broken the hearts of
the whit" man and black man alike. It
concludes: â¢â¢Lord, let there fall
straight down upon her h*ad the curse
of the mean and the curse of the good,
the curse of the sick and the curse of
the strong."

AUDIENCE AT THE ALHAMBRA THEATER LAST NIGHT.
"Speech, after all, is v.-hat matters
most. It is the essence of the whole
thing. What makes poetry great is
music, and if an actor loses the music
he loses everything. In the Greek days
words of the manuscript were marked
with notes by the players, and the pitch
was given from the notes of a pipe. In,
Ireland they are doing that, too. All
the arts have gone through the same
process â a calling toward the heart.
First it was the speech, then the scen
ery, and so on. Now it is for us to be
gin inward~warm the heart again and
renovate outward.

am a lover of poetry, and I do not want
any limitations In the loftiness of
speech."
they receive the support of the critics."
"In order to bring the play back to its
former simple and honorable place it
must be brought back to penury," he
said. "The imagination is too often sold
for a price. The theater must be shorn
of its accessories, its blazonry and its
tinsel. Worst of its crimes is the scene

".To one believes the average play
of to-day is anything but contempti
ble," said the poet. "And why is it?
Why is it, though, that the modern play,
is so liberally patronized? It is be
cause the theater is the only popular
art. A play that doesn't run more than
a hundred nights in London* is consid
ered a fai'.ure. One of Moliere's plays
was considered a success when it ran
twenty nights.
"Tlie decadence is largely the legacy
of overriches and the desire tor money.
The theater is wedded to the mob. In
Bngland the plays are presented by
the people of wealth, who pander to
the mob. But the sharr.o of it is. that
form, the observer finds a good, strong
man with a purpose.
"Bad, very bad." is Mr. Yeats' opin

Two of Baltimore's Most Prominent
Young: Persons Elope to Neigh
boring City and Arc Married.
PHILADELPHIA, Ja"h. 27. â Mon
cure Robinson and Sarah Srsson Abell,
members of two of Baltimore's rich
est and most influential families, have
eloped to Chester, Pa., where they
were married by Mayor Howard H.
Houston. They came to Chester,
where Robinson's brother-in-law has
a country home, and the wedding had
been arranged to take place In a
church of which the bride is a mem
ber when a telegram from the higher
ecclesiastics in Baltimore put a stop to
the cermenoy. The police also ap- !
peared with telegrams commanding '
them to stop the wedding. But the
party appeared before the Mayor and
satisfied him that the license was reg
ular. After the bride had sworn she
was of age he made them husband and
wife. The bride's mother appeared a
few minutes too late. -

The men in charge of the big fleet of
coal barges at the Pumpkin Patch,
above this city, say the danger from"
the heavy ice now running out is prac
tically over. One barge, containing
26,000 bushels of coal, the property of
the Monongahela River Consolidated
Coal and Coke Company, was sunk.
Sixty barges were forced aground for
a short time, but were again floated
without damage.

KANSAS CITY, Jan. 27.â Mrs. Lulu
Prince Kennedy, on trial a second
time for the murder in January, 1901,
of her husband, Philip H. Kennedy,
local contracting agent of the Mer
chants' Dispatch Transportation Com
pany, collapsed in court to-day. Mrs.
Kennedy had been In tears all morn
ing and when her mother assumed
the stand and admitted that the de
fendant had been secretly married
since her conviction for the murder
of her husbnnd she fainted and it
was necessary to carry her from the
room. ,.
A few days before he was killed by
his wife, Kennedy brought suit to have
their marriage set aside, alleging that
Miss Prince's father and her two
brothers had forced him to marry
her. She was convicted and sentenced
to ten years in the penitentiary. The
Supreme Court recently reversed -the
decision on a technicality. It devel
oped to-day that she married John
Kramer, a local lawyer, several
months after her conviction. She la
said to have killed Kennedy because
he refused to live with her.
Will Prince was convicted and
served a sentence in the penitentiary
on a charge of conspiring with his
sister in the murder of Kennedy, and
Albert K. Prince, another brother,
who was drowned in the recent
wreck of the steamer Clallam off Vic
toria, B. C, was indicted on a similar
charge.
Th" only possible feature which the jury
were able to find connecting me with the Iro
quols fire disaster was the alleged nesligence
and incompetency of my appointees. Fire Chitf
Musham and Building Inspector Williams. 1
wan: to call attention to the fact that Chief
Mueham has been connected with the Chicago
fire department for forty years, beginning: at
the bottom of the ladder and winning his way
to the position of Assistant Chief by the gal
lant and heroic conduct of a lifetime. Upon
the retirement of Chief Sweenle I appointed
Musham Chief. The appointment was on mer
its and met with unanimous approval. When
the position of Building Commissioner became,
vacant last summer I Invited the Builders"
Club, the Association, of Architects and varloua
non-partisan professional organizations to
name the best available man for the vacancy.
They named Mr. Williams, a Republican, and
Kave me the strongest testimony as to his
character and efficiency. I appointed him
and he entered most earnestly upon his duties.
Roth of thÂ«Â«e men were Ideal appointments.
The imputation of guilt upon these two men
l!Â» unjustifiable, but to strike at roe over their
shoulders is little short of Infamy.
I have gone ovÂ»r the testimony of Fir* In
spÂ»otpr Mueham and Building Inspector Wil
liams and the Mayor particularly, and I can
say without qualification or hesitation that I
flnd not cne word In the evidence which tends
ev?n remotely In my judgment that the Mayer
had any knowledKe of this matter or that hÂ«
was in any respect negligent of any duty 1m
rosed upon him by the law* or by the rules
that commonly apply to persons who are rÂ»
s-ponglble for the swfety of other*. Â«
I find that them were irross violation* not
only of the city ordinances, but of common
rules of safety that anybody with any expert
knowledge would have said were essential.
The Mayor, who Is simply at the head of the
city government, cannot be held responsible
for any misconduct in his subordinate's office.
Following his release Mayor Harrison
made the following statement:
CHICAGO. Jan. 27.â Mayor Carter H.
Harrison was to-day ordered by Judge
Richard S. Tuthill to be discharged
from custody for any responsibility for
the wholesale loss of life In the Iroquols
Theater fire. The Judge declared that
the Mayor was in no way guilty or lia
ble, and that the Coroner's Jury In or
dering Mayor Harrison held to the
Grand Jury had put an unjust stigma
upon the Mayor, who had failed in no
particular, either In omission or com
mission. Said the court:

which does not Include Sehryh M.

went down in the mino to work last :
night, but became separated from thr
rept arid nandercd far ahead, away
from th<* air. His body was round Fit
tins with his hack to the wall. He had
evidently been overcome by the after
damp.
This brings the official number of

keeping down the nunbÂ»r of volunteers,
for they realize that there is still much
danger in the mine: but it is believed
that Roderick will get a sufficient num

on Sunday, -with the exception of the
Catholics, who will bf> buried according

ST. LOUIS, Jan. 27.â More than
twenty persons were injured, some of
them fatally, \\hen two cars upon the
Broadway line collided to-day.
The fnjured:- John Barrington, badly
crushed, internal injuries, probably
fatal; Walter Sieverntrltt. internal In
juries, serious: Frank Gill, employe of
the city Water Department, scalp cut,
nose broken; J. H. Hobelman, serious;
William Miller, serious; Thomas Mc-
Govern, ankles broken, serious; George
Decker, feet and chest crushed; Frank
Alter, slight; Alfred Koopfer, slfght;
Joseph Zermy, slight;- George Baker,
slight; Christopher Juergin, motorman
of front car. perhaps fatally; Walter
Jensen, slight; William Merry, slight;
Clnra Bock, slight; George Clown,
slight; Cassie Gafner, slight; Birdie
Schner, slight; Miss Ida Knause.
slight; Lizzie Clifton, slight; Miss Julia
C. Doerner, slight.
Both cars were northbound and trav
eling in a dense fog. The accident oc
curred while the front car was sta
tionary, owing to a quarrel between
the conductor and a passenger over a
fare. The second car was coming at
high speed. When within 100 feet away
the front car loomed up through the
fog, but It was useless to try to avoid
a crash. None of the 100 passengers
on the second car knew that the acci
dent was impending until the craSh
came. The second car crushed its way
through the rear of the front car until
it reached almost the middle of It.
The dozen or more passengers on the
rear platform of the front car were
Jammed together under the rear car.
The second for half its distance was
crushed and the passengers inside were
thrown about, while showers of broken
glass fell upon them. A panic ensued.
The less seriously hurt began to fight
to escape. Children and women were
trampled, upon and the weaker ones
were beaten against the wreckage.

more than thirty years the mystery
surrounding the sudden and unexplain

prosperous young man of this town,
has been partially cleared by the re

of Penrose. Utah, announcing Geyer"s
death in California. The letter, which
.was received by Postmaster Collamore,
gave no details, merely saying that
George Geyer, formerly of Friendship,

leaving considerable property and ask
ing if he had any relatives in Friend

who live here and a brother in Somer

The first was based on an expenditure
of $34,000,000. and included provision for
one battleship, one armcrred cruiser,
three protected cruisers, four scout

asked this year for the Guantanamo
station' and a little less than that
amount for the one in the Philippines.
While nothing definite was decided
on, general discussion in committee

which will give to each soldier who
served ninety days and who has

month; 66 years, $10 per month, and
70 years, $12 per month. In addition
to the above rates his bill gives to
the men ivho served two years or
more an additional increase of two
dollars a month in each of the above
classes. The bill increases the mini
mum of pensions Allowed to $8 per
month, instead of $6, which will in
crease the pensions of 125,394 sol
diers who are now on the rolls' at
$6 a month. The bill further pro
vides that the pensions of widows
who were married to soldiers prior to
January 1. 1S70. and who are now on
the rolls drawing $8 shall be increased
to $12. Heretofore the law has been
that they could not get $12 unless
their husbands died of disease con
tracted in the service. This bill will
give an increase to the men who
served ninety days and increases for
the men who fought through the en

NEW ,Y0RK, Jan. 27.â Mrs. Charles
Walter Clark of San Mateo, Cal.,'
daughter-in-law I of , Senator Clark of
Montana, died in this/ city to-night.
Mrs. Clark had been under ' medical
treatment for about six weeks, but was
not believed to be critically ill until
Monday, when her sickness took a
dangerous turn, and her husband and
other members of her family were
summoned to her bedside.
Charles W. Clark is on the way from
Arizona, and is expected to /each this
city on Friday 'morning.- Mrs. M. I*
Cunningham, Mj^. Clark's mother, will
reach this city to-morrow, and other
members of the family are on their

tor Clark or from St. Thomas Church,
and the interment' will be in Senator

etery.
Mrs. Clark was married j June ' 30,
1896, at Butte, Mont. There has been
no issue of the .union. * *â â¢ -Â¦.
Ear.ly this 'evening, when told there
was no '.hope for his daughter-in-law,
tearS" N streamed down the ' cheeks ' of
Senator Clark as he said with a quiv
ering voice:
"God. grant, that she may live until
Charles reaches her side. My boy. will

TOPEKA, Kans.. Jan. 27.â A Santa
Fe special train is rushing eastward
from Jerome, Ariz., with the son of
Senator "Clark of Montana - aboard.
Clark is making every effort to reach
the bedside of his dying wife in New
York. The hope of the Santa Fe is to
make Chicago at noon on Thursday.
At Albuquerque, . N. M., Clark char
tered the special train in order to con
nect with the Twentieth Century Lim
ited, on the Lake Shore for New York.
The special was composed of" engine,
private car and coach, and left Albu
querque at 5:45 o'clock this morning.
It is expected that the run of 1377 miles
from Albuquerque to Chicago will be
made in twenty-nine and a half hours,
which is seven and a half hours faster
than the time of the Santa Fe's east
bound California Limited between th^
same points, and about three hours
quicker than the time of the westbound
Lowe special last August.
Clark is unaware that his wife is
dead. An effort was made here to give
him the dispatch announcing her death,
but the train rushed through Topeka at
the rate of forty miles an hour. No
stops will be made until Kansas City is
reached. The Santa Fe had special en
gines ready at all important stations
between here and Newton to be used in
case of accident. None were needed, as
no stops were made except at a small

"I do not claim to have been the
original Roosevelt man." said Landis.
"Years ago I antagonized him and his
ideas and it came to be a habit with
me to say harsh things about him. In
my own newspaper I said he was a
sham reformer and pretender. But I
have changed my mind with reference
ta Theodore Roosevelt, as hatfe millions
of others of his countrymen." .
Reviewing the voting qualifications
imposed by constitutional action in
Southern States, Hardwick said it was
not believed by Southern lawyers of
ability that any of these qualifications
was in conflict with the fifteenth
amendment. He said the negro could
no longer stand on his merits as a citi
zen. There never had been any dis
position in the South to deprive the
negro of his civil rights, the right to
earn a living and the right of protec
tion to life and property. There could
not be political equity, he added. He
quoted statistics and said It was shown
that as illiteracy decreased among the
race criminality increased, from which
he deduced thaj education had been
detrimental rather than beneficial to
the negro.
Calling attention to the laws of a
number of States, including Ohio, Ver
mont, Massachusetts, Maine, Oregon.
California, Wyoming and Idaho, he said
that if the representation of the South
ern States were to be reduced because
of the voting qualifications imposed
the representation of the States named
would have to be reduced for the same
reason.
PLIGHT OP THE DEMOCRACY.
Landis of Indiana said -the Demo
cratic narty was in the midst of de
moralization and humiliation, that it
was without a leader, while the Re
publican party stood with its face to
the future, more hopeful than ever.
The Republicans, declared Landis,
would go into the battle on the party's
record. He called attention to the pros
perous condition of the Southern States
and, replying to a question by Livings
ton of Georgia, he said the Democratic
States, were prosperous in spite of
themselves.
RIGHTS OF THE XEGRO.
'"It should be remembered that if
one man more than any other
was conspicuous in further promot
ing the financial policy of Grover
Cleveland it was John Pierpont Mor
gan, a man who has sunk from the
condition of adviser of Presidents and
inventor of financial legislation to the
level of a man with a gold brick to
sell or a confidence man with three
cunning little shells at a county fair."
Hardwick of Georgia, speaking on the
race problem, rejoiced at the happy
relations now existing between the
North and South. He said the South
yielded to no section In loyalty, and in
that spirit he invoked consideration of
the question. The negroes, he said,
constituted about S6 per cent of the
voting population in eleven of the
Southern States.
SCOKES PIERPOXT MORGAN.
Cochran of Missouri, replying to
Burkett, paid his respects to J. Pier
pont Morgan. The financial policy in
augurated by President Cleveland, he
said, emanated from no political party,
but from a coterie of gentlemen who
then and since then had been the ad
visers of Presidents, and who had by
their vicious financial legislation
brought upon this great continent the
desolation of a desert and had now fol
lowed it up by plundering every man
of small means and every small inves
tor in their neighborhood.
When the House went into commit
tee of the whole on the urgent de
ficiency bill, Burkett of Nebraska,
speaking on party issues, said the
Democrats would not know whether
they would talk free silver or the gold
standard until after their convention
at St. Louis and they learned who was
to control the party â the gentleman
from Nebraska or the reorganizers.
the race problem. Discussion of fly
ing machines was precipitated by the
report of the Appropriations Commit
tee, which recommended the tabling
of a resolution calling upon the Secre
tary of War for information as to ex
penditures that have been made with
flying machine tests. Hitchcock
(Democrat) of Nebraska, author of
the resolution, and Robinson (Demo
crat) of Indiana spoke in opposition
to the resolution. The resolution was
tabled.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27. â General
debate in the House on the urgent de
ficiency bill digressed to a discussion
of political topics, the race question
and aerial navigation.
Burkett of Nebraska led off with a
discussion of the political situation
from a Republican standpoint and
Cochran of Missouri spoke for the
Democrats. Hardwick (Democrat) of
Georgia made an extended address on
Simmons also announced his inten
tion to vote for the various resolutions
of inquiry and closed with the expres
sion of a desire that Colombia might
be compensated for her loss.
Simmons said he believed that the
President and the Secretary of State
should be relieved of all charge of
complicity in the Panama revolt, and
announced his belief that the change
of recommendation by the Isthmian
Canal Commission from the Nicara
guan to the Panama route had been
the result of honest conviction. He
also accepted the Spooner act as a de
liberate pronouncement by Congress in
favor of Panama and a direction to
the President to construct the canal by
that route "if posible to acquire the
title in a reasonable time."
Interpreting the phrase "reasonable
time" on broad principles, he did not
believe that there was any lapse of
reasonable time which would have
made it the President's duty to turn
to the alternative route designated in
the statutes. He continued:
I Join my colleagues on this side of the cham
ber in condemning whatever wrong the Presi
dent and the administration have done In con
nection with brining about the independence of
Panama, but in my vote on the treaty I pur
pose to recognize and act on the fact that
Panama is an independent .state, possessed of
equal rights and powers to make this treaty
as we ourselves posseBs. not only with our con
sent, but with the practically unanimous con
tent of all civilized nations of the world.
tlon with my notions of right and law. but I
cannot and be honest with myself. I am
bound to say (and 1 have no pleasure In say
ing It) that the course of the President, both
In connection with the revolution In Panama
and the recognition of its independence, was,
to say the least, hasty, rash and dangerous to
the peace and welfare of this country, and jus
tifies the feeling of many of his political
friendP. as well as his political opponents, that
he lacks that conservatism which considera
tions of national stability and safety make
necessary and desirable in the chief executive
of the nation.

Gertrude Goewey Havens made
upon her deathbed a will leaving her
entire fortunes-valued at about $30,
000/ to her- newly born son. Mrs.
Havens died in Berkeley last June,
but her will was only filed to-day by
her husband, John T. Havens. To him
is left the care of the child and the
custody of his fortune. He is given
entire control of the property, which
is to be husbanded for the benefit of
the child until he is 30 years of age,
unless the father sees fit to relinquish
his "charge sooner.
The child to whom the mother gave
her all was yet unnamed whe^n she
died. The weakness of death was
upon her when she signed the will
making provision for his future and
she was only able to make a mark
upon the paper. The mark was wit
nessed by Ethel Sherman and'Eliza
beth M. Cole. It gave to the dying
woman's heir stock in the Goewey
Estate Company of San Francisco
valued at $25,000; household goods
and furniture, $1000;' jewelry, $1500;
stock in the .Pacific Gas and Improve

Jail bars have no terrors for David
Williams and Pearl James, the youth
ful burglars who ( escaped from the
Niles calaboose Monday . night, were
recaptured yesterday and this morning
had worked their way out of a cell in
the Centerville lockup. The pair had
a neatly planned scheme to escape
again foiled by the unexpected appear
ance of Deputy District Attorney A.
P. Leach at the jail in company with
Constable Roderick.
James and Williams were taken to
the Centerville jail last night from this
city. Before morning the boys had cut
their way out of the cell and Into the
corridor, but the large outside door
blocked them. \ Leach,' who had gone
to Centerville to conduct the boys'' pre
liminary examination, went to the lock
up with Roderick.
As the visitor entered the jail hÂ£
saw James standing on one side of the
door and Williams on the other side,
ready to jump for freedom. [, But the
unexpected appearance of the two 'men
disconcerted the beys. Roderick had
his wily guests handcuffed, and on the
way to court before they had recov
ered from their surprise. The constable
declares that If he had gone^to the Jail
alone he would have been attacked by
the * half-freed youths. Justice Sand
holdt held the boys for trial on charges
of burglary.

A strange coincidence is that a simi
lar balance was stolen from the min
ing laboratory at Stanford University
only two nights ago. In that case,
thoujrh, the burglar became frightened
before getting far with his booty and
dropped it in a field. It was afterward
recovered.
The authorities at the University ol
California are trying to catch the thief
who stole an assayer's balance, worth
$S0. from the mining building, last
night. What he could do with the ma
chine, unless he is a student, passes the
understanding of the sleuths, as it is
nothing but old Junk to anybody who
is not, acquainted with its intricacies.
The university people don't want to
believe that a student would do such
a thing:, but they can't see who else
would have done it.
The machine was stolen from the as
say laboratory on the northwest side
of the mining building. The burglar
got into it by going through a window.
Not long aso this window was broker,
over the latch and it was easy for the
miscreant to put his hand in and turn
it so thai he could raise the window.

The same trick was successfully
worked on the Pierce Hardware Com
pany and at J. W. Orear's establish
ment. The three bicycles have been
claimed by their owners. But the guns
are still missing.
First the thief stole three good bi
cycles. With one of the wheels he
called at the J. P. Maxwell Company'3
store and after much persuasion was
induced to purchase a. valuable shot
gun. To make the trade satisfactory
the customer left his bicycle as se
curity for the weapon. That was the
last seen of the man -with the gun.
The police were notified and they
learned that the pledged wheel was a
stolen one.
OAKLAND. Jan. 27. â A thief who
steals bicycles at wholesale and then
trades the stolen machines for shot
guns or rifles is the newest operator
to give the police and various victim
ized merchants trouble. For a week
a young man, who gave the name of
George Fuller, has trfus been working
in this city, the scheme being recorded
as an entirely original one to the de
tectives in Oakland.
PLEDGES STOLEN' WHEELS
FOR VALUABLE FIREARMS
On the eve of the old lady's funeral,
set for to-morrow morning' from the
church that was reared by her munifi
cence, there, has been made public the
story of the estrangement of the aunt
and her nephew, who was her nearest
kinsman. Tore, with his sister, Mrs.
Nellie Davitt, wife of Michael Davitt,
the Irish leader, enjoyed the closest
relations with their aunt until the sep
aration occurred. Mrs. Davitt long ago
returned to her husband in Ireland, but
Yore was in the aunt's family until
his marriage, to which the elderly lady,
it is said, took exception and compelled
her nephew to withdraw from her
household.
Deeply embittered is the nephew, who
declares he was not nermitted to see
his aunt before her death. Tore says
he is convinced that he has been dis
inherited by Mrs. Canning, but the idea
is not based on definite knowledge con
cerning what Mrs. Canning might have
done toward making a will.
Some time before the old lady sold
the Canrrmg block at the southwest
corner of Broadway and Thirteenth
street to Henry A. Butters. Yore, who
had charge of the building, was de
posed He was succeeded by Joseph
Kenney. a former letter carrier. Tore
declares one of the reasons for the
trouble with his aunt was because he
objected to the sale of the building.
He said that prejudice had been en
gendered against him and that he felt
convinced he ! would not receive a
nephew s share under his aunt's will
if she left one.
"I have no personal knowledge on
the subject of Mrs. Canning's will," ex
plained Yore to-night, "and I therefore
cannot say now whether there will be
litigation or not. In many matters I
was treated unjustly by my aunt. It
was only by accident I learned she was
ill, and I feel that there has been much
in the conduct of those about her to
which I can take exception."
During her lifetime Mrs. Canning,
who was of a deeply religious nature,
gave much to the church in whose
faith she had lived. As the benefac-,
tress of St. Francis de Sales parish,
Mrs. Canning gave nearly $150,000 to
erect and maintain its fine church edi
fice. With the pastor, the Rev. Thomas
McSweeney, Mrs. Canning enjoyed a
lifelong friendship. Father McSweeney
said to-night:
"I am in no way connected with the
making of Mrs. Canning's will. In fact,
I advised her to have no priest appear
in the disposition of her estate, because
I knew of the annoyance sometimes
caused in such matters. Mrs. Can
ning's friendship had been lifelong
with me, and her great generosity to
this parish was well known. I do not
know how she has disposed of her
estate."
Airs. Canning's fortune is said to
be close to $500,000. The Canning block
alone was sold for $295,000.
. William J. Yore, the nephew of the
late Mrs. Mary Canning, the wealthy
pioneer who built St. Francis de Sales
Church, has declared his belief that he
has been disinherited by the aunt whom
he served for twenty years as confi
dential agent and manager of her large
estate. . v..

Without a sign of ceremony the first
shovelful of earth was turned this
morning from the site of the University
of California where the walls of Cali
'fornia Hall will rise. The conventions
were entirely shunned in the start-off
of this important undertaking, and it
might have been the excavation for
hen coop for all that anybody seemed
to care. Early in the morning the con
tractor for the digging, William J.
Schmidt, arrived with his men an.d
teams and set them to burrowing into
the ground. There was absolutely no
sentiment, no ceremony, no speechify
ing. :
The contractor's pick and shovel men
I began prodding along a line that was
defined by' the stakes and strings of the
surveyors a while ago. These stakes
and strings mark out a site that is a
few hundred feet west of old North
Hall and near the tennis court and
baseball diamond. It is on a slope that
is partly artificial ground.
In order to get down to hard pan,
upon which the foundations will rest,
Contractor Schmidt must excavate
soma 4400 cubic yards of this artificial
ground. This will require at least a
month's work. After that the concrete
foundation will be put in by the Contra
Costa Construction. Company, of which
Guy Hyde Chick is the president. It
will take 35,0,00 cubic yards of cement
and gravel to complete the' foundations
and will require at least 100 days of
work.
California Hall is to cost $250,000. that
sum having been appropriated for it by
the last State Legislature. It will be
built entirely of stone, steel, concrete
and glass, thus making it an entirely
fire-proof building. There will practical
ly four floors in the building that can
be used. The basement will contain the
vaults, ventilating apparatus and stor
age rooms. The firsr floor will contain
classrooms and an auditorium, with a
seating capacity of 500 people. On the
second floor will be the administrative
offices of the university â the offices of
the president, secretary, recorder and
a meeting-room for .the Board of Re
gents. In the attic win be storage
apartments and files for the preserva
tion of the university archives.
Contracts for the steel structural and
stone work will be let as soon as the
foundation is laid. The kind of stone to
be used has not yet been selected, but
it will probably be Raymond granite,
the same a^ that being used on the
Hearst mining building. The roof will
be tiled with Spanish tiles. It will take
eighteen months to finish the building
if all goes well.

FROM EPISCOPAL CONVENTION AND SCENE AT BANQUET.
sented reports of convocations dealing
with mission work, reports of the same
having been published by the press
at the time the convocations were held.
A. X. Drown presented a resolution
that a set sum must be voted by the
convention to carry on the mission
work. He said that the, sum should
first be determined by a finance com
mittee after proper consideration and
that sentiment should not enter into
the matter. He did not favor the pres
ent haphazard method of leaving It to
the various parishes to make contribu
tions.
Rev. W. C. Shaw presented a resolu
tion that the amount to be voted for
mission work should be $10,000, and this
resolution led to a spirited debate.
Chancellor Drown moved to amend by
having the amount voted cut to $7000.
He declared that from his experience
as a business man he knew it would
be difficult to raise $10,0'K) In the dio
cese for mission work. Hf; did not want
to see the figure set at $10,000 and then
find the parishes come irt and say they
could not raise their proportion.
Revs. F. W. Clampett'- and Burr M.
Wreeden favored the proposal to have
$10,000 voted for mission work, and
Archdeacon Emery, Robert Bruce and
John Landers delivered speeches on the
same lines. All these gentlemen de
clared that it was absolutely necessary
for $10,000 to be voted- and said the
parishes could raise the sum without
much trouble.
The' amendment of Chancellor Drown
to havs the sum fixed at J7000 was lost,
and the motion to make it $10,000 pre
vailed.
ELECT NEW OFFICERS.
The business of electing members to
various committees and delegates for
the next general convention of the
Episcopal church was proceeded with.
As a majority of the votes cast Is
required to elect, the balloting of yes
terday did not fill the required vacan
cies. The clergy and laity voted sepa
rately, the clergy singly and the lay
delegates by delegations.
The result of the election yesterday
was as follows: Registrar of the dio
cese, Rev. "W. A. Brewer, re-elected
unanimously; chancellor of the diocese,
A. X. Drown, reappointed; standing
committee, Revs. John Bakewell, F.
W. Clampett, E. L. Parsons, Burr M.

ger, Rev. D. O. Kelley and W. A. M.

vention. Rev. F. W. Clampett.
The convention will to-day elect
three clerical members to the board of
missions, one member of the board of
directors, three clerical deputies and
three lay deputies to the general con
vention, as well as eight alternates to
the convention and one clerical mem
ber to the missionary council.
Rev. E. L. Parsons presented his re
port on the state of the church, which
was similar to the reports of other offi
cials in that it covered the same
grounds.
Rev. Clifton Macon reported on the
lack of scholars for the divinity schools
and made an earnest plea that the
schools be supported and that there be
no lack of material to be educated as
servants of the church.
The convention -will meet again this
morning: at 9:20 at Grace Church.
On the adoption of a resolution on
Tuesday to have a committee act with
various religious and lay bodies in or
der to secure the passage of Federal
laws to provide for uniform marriage
and divorce laws the following com
mittee was appointed by Bishop Xich
ols: Revs. H. H. Powell. C. O. Tillson.
Hamilton Lee; lay delegates, W. Rigby
and L. C. McAfee.
The churches of the Holy Savior of
Santa Clara and the Holy Innocents of
San Francisco were admitted to union
with the convention on a report from a
special committee.
Bishop Xichols appointed the follow
ing committee on general relief fund:
W. A. M. Van Bokkelen, A. X. Drown,
W. H. Crocker and Rev. V. B. Lewis.
The report of the committee on can
ons on the subject of the ciergy relifif
fund of the diocese and its relation to
the general clergy relief fund was or
dered sent to a special committee.
The report of Archdeacon Emery,
dealing with the funds for church ex
tension w"ork. was then received. The
report showed that JlO.OOo had been ap
portioned for mission work as follows:
To San Francisco, $7000; San Jose,
52000, and San Joaquin Valley, $1000.
The report showed the need for more
funds to carry on mission work and
that there was a steady growth of
guilds and clubs in the diocese.
LIVELY DEBATE OCCURS.
Deans Hanson, Shaw and Lewis pre-
en." The new body will only deal with
women's work in the church, and its
formation is a decided novelty.
XEWXY AMENDED SECTION*.
The amended section of the constitu
tion of the diocese now reads as fol
lows:
The lay members shall bÂ« males and shall
consist of delerates, not exceeding five, from
each parish and mission in union with the
convention. The lay delegates from each par
ish shall b* chonen by the vestry thereof and
the lay delegates from each mission shall bÂ«
chosen by the members thereof; provided that
r.o person shall be competent to Â»Â»n - e aa a lay
delegate unless ho has been a qualified voter
cf the parish cr mission he represents during
the six calendar months next before his elec
tion. Provision shall be made by canon for
a houee of churchwomen to meet In the uma
week with the convention, with power, subject
at all times to the constitution and canons
of the dioÂ«?ese. to legislate for the conduct of
woman's v.ork in the church and to act in a
consultative capacity upon euch other matters
as the convention may from time to time sub
mit to it for its opinion.
The committee to draft the canons
for the new body will file a printed
report thirty days before the next con
vention. The committee appointed by
Bishop Nichols consists of A. N. Drown,
W. A. M. Van Bokkelen, Vincent Xeale,
John A. Wright. Mrs. A. X. Lawver,
Mrs. James Xewlands, Mrs. Thomas
Flint Jr. and C. H. Xorris.
TO REPORT ON DIVORCES.
On resolution Bishop Nichols appoint
ed a committee to draft canons for the
guidance of the "house of churchwom-
â¢Â¦This action is the result of a spirited
. dejbate that took place yesterday at the
*"tcohd session of the fifty-fourth con
â¢vntion of the diocese, held at Grace
Ofcnxch. The women of the church.
â¢ JjoVever, were singularly honored by
the 'convention by the establishment of
Â» t'house of churchwomen," which body
v.ill deal with women's work in the
xlrurch and sit at the same time as the
convention proper does. The pioneer
Ftep taken by the California diocese is
Ijkcly to be followed by other dioceses
f. : f-.the Episcopal church.
â¢""Thp debate on the status of women
:Â«i-the convention proceedings took up
Â¦the. best part of yesterday. The com
n:t;^< 1 eti canons had introduced an
ernendm^nt to the constitution to pro
vjde'that all lay delegates should be
maies. _ This amendment was further
amended to provide for the cstablish
n.Vnt of a "house of churchwomen."
The r.ropo5ition to exclude women
from the convention and to have them
\i*>pt as a separate body had most of
th<* . men as its champions, but the
v.omen delegates had the aid of many
Cf xhf men in the convention in their
opposition.
TAKE OPPOSITE VIEWS.
The arguments put forward by those
Â¦who -desired to exclude the the women
delegates were based on the grounds
Â»t:at women had a special sphere to fill
snd that men were neglecting the work
cf the church so long as they knew the
iromen were interested.
It -was explained that there was no
fi^Fire to slight women, but. on the con
trary, to give them more recognition by
the establishment of the "house ol
churchwomm."
Vincent Xoale delivered a long ad
dress, telling how women had been
Civen the privilege of voting for ves
tiymcn, and said that later on the
ranons of the diocese had been con
s'rued to allow women to be elected as
lay delegates to the conventions. He
declared that with that privilege wom
en could claim the right to be elected
en various committees or to go to the
pen^ral convention as representatives
of the California diocese.
Mrs. R. J. Riley of Gilroy. Mrs. E.
Mdjowan of Monterey and Mrs. Thom
as Flint Jr. addressed the convention,
protesting against the proposed exclu
sion of women from the convention.
Rc-v. A. J. O'Meara championed the
cause of the women and was aided by
Rev. J. G. Gassman. Revs. J. O. Lin
coln and H. B. Collier spoke in favor of
the amendments, as did A. X. Drown.
LOST AXD RECONSIDERED.
"When the amendments were put to a
Vote the proposition to establish a
"house of churchwomen" was lost, ow
ing to the required two-thirds vote not
t'cing secured in the affirmative. The
Vote of the clergy showed 31 ayes and
10 noes, while the lay vote stood 20 ayes
stad l:.' noes. The women all voted in
the negative.
A motion to reconsider was then
rryjved. It was explained that If the
first amendment, to limit all lay dele
gates to males, prevailed, the women
would have absolutely no voice in the
affairs of the diocesan deliberations.
Bishop Xichols addressed the conven
tion and gave his views on the subject
of the proposed changes. He favored
fhe "house of churchwomen." and felt
that the women could assist the work ;
nf the church by meeting as such a
body instead of being present as a small
minority in the convention proper. The
Bishop paid a tribute to the work of
the churchwomen of the diocese.
The motion to reconsider prevailed
and th*> vote was taken on the proposal
to establish the "house of church
women." It was carried unanimously,
us was thÂ«* amendment to limit all lay
delegates to the convention to the male

The Rev. David J. Evans, D. D., who
has been called to Grace Church to fill
the position made vacant by the death
of the Rev. R. C. Foute, is a man of
remarkable strength and strong per
sonality. Dr. Evans, though not
known to many of the parishioners
personally, is nevertheless known by
his work. He was recommended by
Bishop Potter, .and while traveling In
the East with the object of choosing
a rector two of the vestrymen had the
opportunity of hearing Dr. Evans.
From that moment there was a de
termination to secure his services for
Grace Church.
In response to the wish of the mem
bers of Grace Church it is certain that
Dr. Evans will come to San Francisco
as soon as his private matters can be
arranged to allow of no interruption
to his work when once here.
Dr. Evans is a native of Great Brit
ain and an Oxford man. His charge at
present is Grace Church. Middle
town, N. Y.
The selection is considered a wise
one and one that will meet with the
approval of Grace Church.

The Church Club gave a banquet at
the Palace Hotel last night at which
Bishop Nichols was the guest of honor.
Besides the laymen who compose the
membership of the club there ' were
over 100 clergymen present to meet the
Bishop.
The great circular table was pro
fusely decorated with flowers.
Albert N. Drown, president of the
Church Club, presided and at the close
of the repast spoke of the high pleas
ure which was theirs at having the
Bishop as their honored guest.
Mr. Drown said that the purpose of
the club was to take up such work as
found favor with the Bishop. It was
a band of laymen ready to give vigor
ous assistance to all church work under
the leadership of the Bishop of the dio
cese.
Bishop Nichols responded and ex
pressed general appreciation of the
work of the club, which stands behind
two works very close to the Bishop's
heart â the Japanese Mission in this
city and the opening of a new Mission
in the Potrero.
Bishop Nichols said it was a source
of great' pleasure to meet the members
of the Church Club.
After the banquet tl.ere was a recep
tion in the parlors of the hotel given
by the Church Club to Bishop and Mrs.
Nichols.
The reception began at 8:30 and last
ed until 11 o'clock. It was estimated
that fully 1500 attended the reception.
In one of the side rooms refreshments
were served and the members of the
club were indefatigable in their attend
ance on their many friends. There
were people present from every part of
the State.
The officers of the club in charge of
the arrangements were A. N. Drown,
president; James McGawley, secretary;
E. D. Beyland. Dr. H. C. Davis and
George E. Butler.

Africa, the Balkans. Manchuria and other storm
centers of the world, comparatively little atten
tion has been given in the United States to affairs in In
/dia since famine and plague ceased to furnish sensational
news. It is therefore worth while to note that the coun
try is now so well off from a physical point of view that
the leaders of her people can devote their energies toward
the attainment of political reforms instead of having to
expend them all in efforts to feed the. famishing and to
check the 'spread of pestilence.
One of the notable institutions of India is the so-called
"Jndian National Congress," which meets to discuss con
ditions of the people and to urge such changes in the
laws and the government of the country as are deemed
conducive to the general, welfare." The congress is com
posed of natives and includes among its members men
whose intellectual eminence is recognized throughout the
civilized world.
At its recent meeting in Madras it devoted itself al
most wholly- to political matters and adopted resolutions
which have been well received in London. As a rule the
objects aimed at by the congress are: larger opportuni
ties for natives to take part in the government of the
country. Nothing revolutionary or even radical- is asked
for, but it is evident the leaders of India have made up
their minds to insist upon having an important part in
the Government hereafter.
By the efforts of the' congress the right of natives to
sit in the various "Legislative Councils" of the country
has been conceded, anda good many- representatives of
the Indian peoples have seats in such bodies. The de
mand is now for the admission of natives to the "Execu
tive Council,*' a position which has never yet been given
to one of them,' notwithstanding, that India has been
under the direct governi.ient of the British crown, for
nearly half a century.

(Copyright. 1304. by Josrph P. Howlp?)
Hunting the hippopotamus is rather
a dull kind of sport. In some '.regions
they are too common to excite any in
terest. You can see them by the hun
dred stretching their lazy length upon
a bank of mud or lying with their
heads above water. As you approach
They will dive under water, remaining
out of siffht from thirty to forty min
utes. When they come up they give a
enort like a locomotive on a frosty
morning, sinking apain when they see
you like a flash. When they pop their
heads out of water that is the time
for you to present your compliments.
If your aim has been true the hippo
potamus â¢ujil roll upon his back and
kick in quite an ungainly fashion.
When he has kicked his last in all
probability he will be sufficiently ac
commodating to retire to the bottom
of the river, whence you wiil have to
fish him up, unless you have patience
enough to wait until the huge carcass
coines up of its own accord, which will
in all likelihood be after the space of
two hours. And now comes the feast.
If your hippo is young the flesh will
l)e tender and toothsome, equal to goat
meat, which is the African standard:
but if you have shot an aged patriarch
you will find his flesh tough and hard
as India rubber. The natives will, how
ever, dispose of every morsel of it for
you with abundant thanks. They seem
never to be able to get enough of ani
mal food, and the person who can sdd
to the supply of that article in their
cuisine Is locked upon as a benefactor.
The hippo's tongue is very fine when
boiled, if the beast is young, and there
is no sense in killing: an old one. Once
I went to examine an old, tough hippo
that I had shot and found that a
crocodile had been trying to make a
meal of him. He had bitten off his
oars and had commenced upon his tail,
but the tail had resisted his effort. He
had evidently given up in disgust after
having broken eff three erf his teeth In
the attempt. The young and the fe
males with young are always fat, the
fat being found between the skin and
the flesh. In cold climates animals se
crete adipose tissue or fat, but
in equatorial Africa, where the climate
is hot, and food is to be found all the
year round, the tendency to secrete
fat is entirely absent. The wild hog is
thinner than his razor-backed cousin
in Georgia. There seems to be some
lack of proper adjustment in this, for
nowhere in all the world is fat more in
demand than in Africa.
Lions and giraffes are not found in
the Congo, but are numerous to the
north and east. Occasionally a strag
gler pets down as far as the Mobangi,
but that is a very uncommon occur
rence. Leopards, however, are fre
quently found, but they are difficult to
reach. When I was at Rafai the peo
ple were terror-stricken because of the
depredations of a man-eating leopard.
During the time of my stay he had
carried off two childrenâ one a boy of
15. the- other a child which he had
snatched away when lying asleep be
tween two women. He was a large
animal and could leap a barrier of five
feet, carrying a heavy goat. His tracks
were large. I kept watch for him night
after night, but he eluded my strictest
vigilance. I was mortified to leave
without getting him. I, however, first
and last shot many leopards. Some
or the'r Ekins I tried to preserve, but
they were destroyed by moths.
Gorilla hunting Is exciting sport, but
shooting a gorilla is too much like
shooting one's grandfather. Looking
upon his humanlike face you feel like
a murderer. On the Sanga I killed sev
eral gorillas and chimpanzees. On the
lower Mobangi there are a few gorillas
and chimpanzees, while on the upper
river thev are unknown. ...
The monkeys have their paths among
the trees, as the elephant has his upon
the ground. If they get out of their
regular beat they become confused.
Wh*n you see a monkey parsing over
a 2imb, if you Â¦watch closely you will
set* his y. hole tribe following him. over
the same lirsb. He is not difficult to
catch once his paths are known. The
monkey is easy to find, as he never
keeps still. You can follow his tracks
by the swaying branches as they gwin^
back. When he Jumps on a branch
he jroes out to the very end of it, c.o

Contrary to what I had been led to

is to be accounted for In part by the
burning of the Ions gTass by the na

among: th<Â» embers. There is a small
greenish -headed snake, which is very
venomous, but It .will not attack and it
i.Â« difficult to find except by the na
tivÂ«s. It winds itself around the vines
and looks like a part of them. I almost
put my hand on one, when a native
drew it away. This is the snake which

of the snake is cut off. pulverized and
mixed with nsdm oil. and Into the com

The railroads have struggled to free
themselves from the demoralization
and loss attending unregulated and
fierce competition. The public has been
insistent upon legislation to protect
their interests against railroad com
bination.
It Is a noteworthy fact, however, that
every legislative act and court decision
directed against the railroads has thus
far resulted only in hastening their
consolidation into great systems .and
communities of interest. The Immense
concentration of control that haa taken
place in the past few years Is the out
come, In large degree, of the trans-
Missouri and trunk line decisions that
prevented the railroads from poollne.'
Yet the public has regarded with fear
and suspicion every step of the evolu
tion tov.ard the elimination of railroad
competition. The prevailing feeling
seems to be that public safety Is as
sured only by free competition, and
that loss of liberty is too high a price
to pay for the stability assured by
railroad peace. So there have for
years been two opposing forces at work
constantly, one for and the other
against monopoly.
Now it is easy to see that the elimi
nation or reduction of railroad competi
tion has its public advantages. Unre
stricted, wasteful competition has cost
the country hundreds of millions of
dollars. Railroad wars have unsettled
business and produced panics. Whole
sale cutting of rates has destroyed hun
dreds of business firms, reduced the
profits of railroad opc-ation so that
dividends have been passed, and in
many Instances have not been paid,
and the roads have gone through bank
ruptcy and reorganization.
_ On the other hand, restriction of com
petition has Imparted stability to rates,
given confidence to business men, and
Bteadiness to the markets. It has re
sulted in consolidations and alliances
which have produced a better public
service by increasing the speed and
safety of trains and applying more sci
entific methods in the transportation
of freight. ;;Â£.â¢>â¢
But the railroad' president's duties
are larger than those of earning divi-"
dends for his stockholders. He is,
rightly speaking, a public officer, with
important public responsibilities.
Every measure that has been taken
to prevent monopoly has seemed to
promote it, and to-day, in spite of all
State and Federal commissions and
court decisions and laws, the railroads
were never under such concentration of
control, and competition was never so
much reduced in volume and intensity.
Professor Emory R. Johnson, in his
book on "American Railway Transpor
tation," divides the railroads of the
United States into nineteen different
systems, whose mileage is over 80 per
cent of the entire 200,000. But as a
matter of fact these nineteen systems
are practically controlled by nine men,
and these nine men may be said to
represent virtually all that is left of
railway competition.
Moreover, between these . nine men
there is, in most instances, an amicable
understanding, and between some of
them a close community of interests.
This does not necessarily mean that
there is no competition. There is.
The agents of the different lines are
still active in soliciting business, both
freight and , passenger, and there is
reason to believe that in spite of laws
to the contrary secret rebates are still
made to large shippers. But excessive
competition is prevented and its waste
is saved. Rates are better regulated
and more stable, business is more
equitably distributed and earnings are
increased.
"I !>m simply a cash register," said
a railroad president some months ago.
"By pressing a button I am supposed
to ring up a dividend every time. If
I do not I am no longer fit to be pres
ident."
The old adage, "Competition is the
life of trade," does not hold good. in
modern business. The constant effort
is to get rid of competition, or at least
to reduce it so far as to prevent waste
and loss. It is true that it is said that
"commerce is war" and that success
in business can be attained onlv by
military organization and discipline.
As war means destruction, this idea
seems to be opposed to the other one
that the constant effort of business
is to get rid of competition. But in
reality they are not in antagonism,
for the object of the commercial Avar
rts to secure peace on the basis of the
elimination of competition.
This fact should be kept steadily in
view, for it lies at the very founda
tion of American railway develop
ment. The history of the railroads
has been that of a series of wars, the
object of which has been to get rid of
competition, and in large measure
they have had that result, each war
having been attended by the acquisi
tion of some conquered territory or
by a forced treaty of peace securing
each system in the unmolested enjoy
ment of its own section.
While the railroads have been
steadily petting together, the public
has been at work seeking to protect
its interests by restrictive legislation.
For it must be remembered that the
railroad company, while a private cor
poration, performs public service. It
obtains its charter and its franchises
from the public, it acquires its right
of way by condemnation proceedings
and it carries freight and passengers
as a "common carrier." The railroad
is a "road." It is a highway of steel.
It cannot be operated as a private
business. Its duties to the public are
even more imperative than its duties
to its stockholders.

The meeting then discussed the proposition to send also
the old Liberty bell. This was voted down. The statement
was made that the bell is the best advertisement that
Philadelphia has, and that it brings thousands of visitors
to the city every year. It was argued that if.it is sent
around the country people will sec it and not go to its
home for that purpose. So it is probable that the old
bell" will not see the St. Louis exposition.
San Francisco may learn much from the intentions of
other cities. Kansas City, for instance, proposes to ex
hibit a model of the convergence of her railroads, with
statements of their annual tonnage and passengers car
ried. A general survey of all the ideas expressed as to
the specialties exhibited by different cities convinces us
that San Francisco and California must, inevery possi
ble way, put forward our climatic asset. This city needs
to show moving pictures of Golden Gate Park in January,
with all of its wealth of tropical foliage, and it must be
made known that it is a scene in January. Another ex
cellent moving' picture would be the members of the
Olympic Club swimming in the surf in January. Such
things tell the story of climate more impressively than all
the tables of temperature that can be printed.
The cities of Southern California should show their
palm-lined streets, and the cities of Northern California
not only their palms, but the fruit-laden orange. trees on
private lawns. There should be November and Decem
ber views of the orange orchards of Northern California.
Everything that we produce from the soil has its origin
in our climate and should be used to make impressive
exhibit of that great physical fact. It affects all our ma
terialities. They converge in it and diverge from it. It
is the central force.
The more one reads of what Eastern cities will do
the greater Is the impression that we can show manu
factures, evidences of the perfection of our public institu
tions and examples of all they can show. We can exhibit
our mineral wealth, with the greatest variety of valuable
metals and minerals found in any State in the Union.
All of this is of the highest value, but in our climate we
have a peculiar possession which we share with.no other
part of the world.
We have dwelt insistently on this subject, because a
vast majority of our people are content to remain in the
State, and do not go outside of it. By habit they take
the climate as a matter of course. It is as if they had
diamonds for nursery playthings in their childhood and
had grown up using them for jack-stones, counters and
pocket pieces. Under such circumstances they ' would
take the brilliants as common things and a matter of
course, and would not appreciate the value put upon
them by others to whom they were not common. Our
climate is our Kohinpor. ., -But we have had it always and
all the lime and do not appreciate it as keenly as the
stranger, to whom it is a thing rare and to be sought.
In this connection we desire to remind our deciduons
friends in Oakland that if they plant deciduous trees on
their streets their city cannot become a winter exhibit
of climate. The bare branches of their trees will class
them with Winnipeg and Oshkosh. An Eastern man
looking for a desirable place to live and enjoy the climate
of California would turn Oakland down on such a picture,
alone. It will do no good to talk to him about the senti
ment that caused the use of the elms. He has known
elms all his life. He wants now to go where the palm
is and to rest him under the bamboo tree.
The bare branches of elms are associated with the
east wind that gives pneumonia to the pump on Boston
Common, and distempers the codfish that shows the way
the wind blows on the Massachusetts State House. You
might as well try to attract him by the picture of a snow
man or a cake of ice. He is cold and has a cough, and
these things give him a spinal shiver. But the picture of
a palm sets him dreaming of sunshine and flowers Let
us be sure and take advantage of these winter months by
getting a line of pictures that set forth our climatic asset,
for we have a monopoly of it.

ELECTRIC RAILWAYSâ Subscriber,
City. The first appliance of electric
power to a railway was by Thomas
Davenport of Brandon, Vt.. In 1S35.
In that year he built a circular track
and ran a car upon It, thereby proving
the possibility of using electricity as a
motor. In 1S31 Professor Page of the
Smithsonian Institution of Washing
ton. D. C, equipped and moral by
electricity a sixteen-horsepower loco
motive, which was run over the Call
more and Washington Railroad at the
rate -? 19 miles an hour. In 18S7 T. J.
Sprage offered*to and did equip twenty
cars of the Union Passenger Railway
of Richmond, Va. and these worked
successfully. They may be said to be
the practical pioneers of the now great
system of electric cars in the United
States. Between 1ST2 and 1SS7 there
were many experiments with electricity
as a motive power for street cars in
Europe, particularly in Berlin, Ger
many. Cars are now run at a speed by
this power as high as 120 miles an
hour.

KING EDWARD has released from prison Colonel
Arthur Lynch, who was rash enough to enter the
field against his country at the head of the Irish
Brigade during the Boer war, and who had been con
demned to life imprisonment upon the charge of treason.
It seems that the wish, privately expressed by President
Roosevelt to Sir Thomas Lipton, had borne fruit in
this magnanimous act on the part of the King,' and
Lynch is free to go "on license," that is without pardon.
This manifestation of royal clemency on the part of the
King redounds to his credit and shows him to be a man
fit' to rule an enlightened nation in these modern times.
.Not only will it win for him the general praise of the
world, but the order for release is calculated to do more
to appease the people of Ireland than all the debates up
on conciliation in Parliament which could be heard be
tween now and the next Christmas holidays. The typi
cal Irishman is as keen to appreciate a kindness as he is
ready to fight against an injury. When the head of the
nation against which he has. been directing all of his
passionate endeavors frees from punishment one of his
own heroes who has sinned the great sin of nations, the
stroke will undoubtedly! come home to his heart.
"Had Colonel Lynch committed his treason two. hun
dred and fifty years ago he would have been hanged as
high as Hainan and possibly his body would have been
parceled out among the most turbulent districts of Ire
land for a lesson. It is a far cry from the speedy execu
tion of a William Wallace or a Monmouth to the libera
tion of one who fought against the flag of the country
in whose legislative assembly he had once had a place.
Such action shows that the medieval ideas 'of crime and
punishment. have come under the softening influence of
modern civilization and that the world is going forward.

Editors of The Callâ Gentlemen:
Noticing your article in Sunday's Ca'.l,
"Plan to reproduce union ferry depot

this suggestion to make, that when the
building is completed at St. Louis and
is brilliantly illuminated with electric
lights on the outside that In order to
make it appear more realistic to the
people who are familiar with the in
teriW of the building I think 'it would
be well to reproduce the smells of stale
fish, decayed vegetables, horse manure
and other vile smells through which
the commuters have to pass whenever
they have to travel to or from the boat.

SAN FRANCISCO. Jan. 23.
Subcriber's Suggestion.
An Australian millionaire, otherwise peaceably inclined,
says he intends to enter the yachting lists, lift the Amer
ica cup and present it to Canada. JVVc could stand every
thing involved except the threatened presentation to Can
ada. She doesn't seem able'to take care of herself, much
less of anything that we prize highly enough to defend
with spirit.
Instantly Dan saw that he had been
"jobbed," and in stentorian tones ex
claimed: "I see you d â d fools are so
drunk you can't get the poinU of that
yarn! I'll tell it again." Then he got
the laugh, with interest, and his friends
realized that it is hard to get ahead of
an Irishman.
When the late Dan O'Connell lived !
over in Marln County he was visited by
one of his friends from the Bohpmian
Club, to whom he told an absolutely
new and good story, which had been
Eent to Dan by a friend in Ireland.
"Don't tell this yarn at the club," Dan
admonished him, "because I want to
use it at the next 'round-table* dinner."
These "round-table" dinners were
given by twenty-five select members of
the Bohemian Club, who loved a good
story, but would not tolerate the tell
ing of an ancient one. Dan's perfidous
club mate not only violated the confi
dence which the jolly poet had placed
in him by telling the story to the
"knights of the round-table," but also
"put ur> a job" on the genial Daniel.
In due time came the night of the din
ner, and when the fun was at its height
there were loud cries for O'Connell.
Dan rose in his place and in his mas
terly way told his newest anecdote. But
when he had finished instead of the
burst of applause v/hich he had expect
ed there wa.s absolute silence, and the
diners went calmly on with their eat
ing.
' O'Connell's New Story.
Trie London Globe. In raking over its
old files, finds a story printed January
4. 1S14, which shows that some of our
.Yankee privateers used to keep John
Bull on the anxious seat occasionally.
The article reads: 1S14 â The town of
Port Patrick was put into a consider
able state of alarm on Sunday, the 14th,
last. A ship, in mold and rig resem
bling the True-blooded Yankee, hov
ered all day close off the harbor, with
every appearance of an intention to
destroy the town and shipping. So great
was the alarm that the packet agent,
by the advice of Dr. McKenzie, one of
the owners, would not permit a vessel
to sail -with the mail. Lieutenant
Rutherford, commanding the Dum
friesshire militia In the barracks, or
dered them under arms. The sailors.
boatmen, robberymen and townsmen
armed themselves with marllnspikes,
boathooks. spades, pitchforks, fowling
pieces and every other weapon they
could procure, determined to oppose the
landing of the Americans. At night the
alarm did not subside. Lieutenant
Rutherford directed three of his men
to take post on the quay, while he him
self remained all night under arms
with the rest of his detachment. Much
praise Is due to this gallant officer for
the zeal and activity he displayed upon
the occasion, as also to the Collector of
Customs, who dispatched an express to
Greenock for a ship of war, and headed
his townsmen. In the morning it was
learned that the strange ship was not
the True-blooded Yankee, but an
armed merchantman, belonging to the
Clyde, and that, owing to adverse
winds, he had come to anchor In Loch
Ryan.
Wholesome Respect.
A REPORT from Washington that the naval authori
ties contemplate removing the naval training
school from Yerba Buena Island has given some of
our contemporaries fearful dreams of a conspiracy on the
part of the officials of the navy to destroy San Francisco
by withdrawing the business that gathers around the
training school, and keeping out of the channels of our
trade the money appropriated for the maintenance of the
school.
Such dreams are nightmares. Yerba Buena is but an
uncomfortable and insufficient place for a school of any
kind. It is swept by every cold wind and drenched by
every fog that blows in from- the ocean. Boys coming
from the interior to enter the school are exposed to a
change of climatic conditions so severe that not a few of
them are seriously affected by it. There is not sufficient
level ground on the island for the needs of the school, and,
moreover, the seas immediately outside the Heads are
nearly always too rough for boys who are but beginning
a novitiate in the service.
There remains an even greater objection to the main
tenance of a naval training school or any government in
stitution on the island. Were the place well fitted in
every way for the school, it would none the less be a
folly to maintain it there; for the island is too valuable
for commerce to t devote it to any. other than commercial
purposes.
Yerba Buena should belong to the city and be used for
the convenience of the vast commerce that is to center
in our harbor. The more the Government makes use of
it the more difficult vyill it be for the city to get it out of
the hands of the Government. We ought, therefore, to
hail with satisfaction the report that the Department of
the Navy is inclined to remove the training school.
There may be differences of opinion as to what point
should be selected for the permanent location, but there
ought to be none in this city nor in Oakland over the
proposal to remove it from Yerba Buena. That island of
right belongs to San Francisco: it is needed for our com
merce and thesooncr we get it the better.
YERBA BUENA ISLAND.
Sharkey, known to ill-fame. even in the world of plug
uglies, is making for San Francisco to seek a refuge
and a little easy money. He will probably receive, both.
In its patronage; of pugs this city enjoys the unique dis
tinction among American cities of being the only place
where the people delight to be foole'd by everybody all
the time.
Discouraged and forlorn, we turned
to our bag of papaws for what consola
tion we could find, then went to sleep.
In the night we floated free, and at
daylight were in the woods again, eight
miles below those luscious provisions.
That wa3 one of the most awful trage-
sight or memory of one made me shud
der. Then, on a Joyful, sunny after
noon, we approached Shawneetown,
Illinois, on the Ohio River, where we
were advertised to exhibit. As we came
in we could see on the bank a crowd of
people. Some carried chickens, some
eggs, some yams, some potatoes, some
"sidemeat" (bacon) and some corn
meal. Our dinner was in sight, for all
those things were intended as payment
for admission at the door, and all were
"good." 1
Our stomachs hungered and our
mouths watered for the feast; but alas!
we were too eager. Working our boat
toward land, we ran upon a reef and
stuck fast. Every effort to set us free
failed. Darkness came on, and before
our eyes our "house"* disbanded and
went home, carrying our supper with it.
Punctually at 10 o'clock the court was
opened, but neither of the lawyers had
appeared until five minutes, even ten
minutes', had passed, when the swing
ing doors opened and both men rushed
into the court. They were about to
apologize for their tardiness in explain
ing that the country stage upon which
they rode was delayed. Their appear
ance indicated the cause of their delay.
Colonel Dudley wora a white, or rather
a dirty linen duster, while Darwin was
garbed in a rusty tweed suit. Neither
had been shaved for a week and. in
fact, j they looked more, like a pair of
tramps than lawyers.
Judge Pratt eyed them for a few sec
onds, then his wrath overcame him and
he said: "Mr. Sheriff, adjourn this
court until 2 p. m., at which time it is
hoped that members of the bar having
official business in the District Court
will appear as if they had not been sud
denly released from a place where wild
animals are confined. This court is
grievously offended."
At 2 o'clock the needed change had
taken place in the appearance of the
two men.
Judge Pratt' s Rebuke.
It was in the early '60's, when San
Francisco was emerging from a tent
village into a city, that O. C. Pratt oc
cupied the old Fourth District Court
bench. At that period silk 'hats, white
boiled shirts and broadcloth coats, ex
cept when .worn by clergymen, were in
deed a rarity. Judge Pratt, who was a
Southerner of the Chesterfield school,
carried his ideas of etiquette to the
bench with him to -the extent that he
even wore kid gloves while presiding.
There was a very important case on
trial in his court, in which Charles B.
Darwin and Colonel Dudley were the
opposing counsels. Both of these law
yers were just the reverse of the
Judges spotless dignity in their gen
eral make-up. In fact, they were slov

day morning when the scene occurred
in which both gentlemen were made
feel the stinging rebuke of Judge Pratt

few native applicants for position can-^gp to compete
against British applicants; the oppressive methods re
sorted to to raise revenues, and 'finally the enforcement
on '.India of land laws, which while good in Great Britain,
where they are in accord with the traditions and the sen
timent.of the people, are found to be unfair and injurious
to the Indian natives, who do not understand them and
cannot conform to them.
* The resolutions of course will have little effect upon
the Indian Government unless supported by a strong
party. in Great Britain. Fortunately it is not at all im
probable that such support will be given. Some of the
foremost men, who have served* the crown in' India are
in full accord with the claims and protests put forward
by' the congress, and when the issue arises in Parliament
the Ministers may have to. concede a good deal of what
has been so reasonably stated and so justly asked. By
slow degree? the Indians in fact are attaining a fair
measure of self government under the crown, and the
sooner it is granted the greater will be the glory of the
empire that has made such government among such a
people politically possible.

When the clothes of the murdered
man were introduced the people in the
courtroom rose in curiosity. Judge
Cabaniss ordered them to resume their
seats and took occasion to tell the wo
men present that they should be home
attending to their household duties in
stead of in a police couri.
When quiet was restored Attorney
Salomon cross-examined Meehan and

to indicate that there had been a-strug
gle before the man was killed."
Detective Armstrong, who was first
detailed on the case, tola of the condi
tion of the body and the pockets being
turned inside out. He said he searched
for signs of a struggle and a weapon,
but found none. His testimony was a
repetition of that given at the Coroner's
inquest on Tuesday.
Deputy Coroner Charles W. Meehan
rehearsed the details of the f removal
ol the corpse to the Morgue and identi
fied the clothes, which were produced
by Hanley, as the ones he had removed
from the body of Blaise. The clothing,
on a motion of the prosecution, was

with his head toward the wall and ins
legs pointing' to the east, slightly in
the direction of Vallejo street. There
was a stranger coming down the hill
toward the body when I was approach
ing it in company with Hogan. The
stranger fciclrcd up Blaise's hat and
crave it to me and I placed it over the
dead man's head. I do not know who
the. man was, as he got away during
the time that I was searching for a
weapon and endeavoring to determine
whether it was a case of murder or
suicide.
William Hogan, the millhand who
first discovered the body of Blaise,
gave testimony that was a duplication
of that given by him at the Coroner's
inquest. The only difference made by
Hogan yesterday v.as that when asked
the distance that the body lay from
the wail he said it was two and a half
feet, and he had testified at the Coro
ner's inquest that it was three and a
half feet away. Hogan said that the
dead man wore a blue suit when he
found him, and that his hat, a soft
Fedora, lay fifteen feet diagonally up
the hill toward Vallejo street from the
body.
Sergeant Christianson, the officer wh-j
was notified by Hogan that there was
a man lying in the cut, told of h!s
search for a weapon and his reaching
the conclusion that the man had been
murdered. He said: '"Wlien I reached
the body the soil about it was very
muddy and damp from the fog of the
night before. The dead man was lying

neck being the only injuries.
Russell ?ho\ved by his diagram that
the spot at which the body lay was the
darkest in the block, being entirely
without any light from the lamp on
the southeast corner of Vallejo street,
which is nearest to the place and is en
tirely 6hut out by the grade of the
street. The diagram was admitted in

The other lamp, on the northeast
corner of Green and Taylor streets. was
shown to ba 1\~, feet from the fatal spot
and shed but little light on account of
the up grade from it to the spot.

bodies, had formed the opinion that
Blaise had been dead about eight or
ten/ hours. The attorneys seized at
Median's declaration that the man had
been dead but eight Hoprs, but Meehan
refused to be put down as an authority
and stated that his estimation of tha
time was but roughly made.
Mrs. Emma Christianson, wife of
Sergeant Christianson, told of hearing
screams on the night of the murder.
Her testimony varied from that she
had already given. When murder was
first suspected Mrs. Christianson said
she heard the screams about 11 or 12
o'clock in the night. Yesterday on the
stand she said that she heard loud,
piercing: screams between 8:45 and 9
o'clock on the Sunday night of January
10. She said: "I was sitting in the
kitchen, the windows of which face on
Taylor street, toward the spot where
the body was found. The kitchen win
dows were open part way and between
8:45 and 9 o'clock I heard several loud
screams, seemingly coming from a man
of powerful voice. I know it was at
that time, because' I had some neigh
bor's children in the house and they
went home at 8:55. I heard the screams
a few minutes before. The sound
came from the direction of Russian
Hill, where the dead man was found."
On cross-examination Mrs. Christian
son was forced to admit that she could
not tell whether the screams came
from the particular portion of Russian
Hill where Blaise was found dead or
from the corner of Green and Taylor
streets, directly across from her
house. She thought, though, that they
came from the direction of the hill, but
would not be positive.
MRS. NEIBLAS FLOUNDERS.
Mrs. Neiblas was the next witness
and the remainder of the afternoon
was taken up with her testimony. In
LEON* SOEDER. ACCUSED OF THE MURDER OF JOSEPH BLAISE. AS HEAPPEARED MANACLED TO A DE
TECTIVn OX HIS WAY TO POLICE JUDGE CABANISS' COURTROOM TO UNDERGO PRELIMINARY
EXAMINATION ON THE CHARGE AGAINST HIM.
Police Officer Russell took the stand
first and testified as to the diagram
he had made of the vicinity in which
the body of Blaire was found. Rus-
Fell. who is employed by the Police De
partment to make such drawings in
criminal cr.scs. told of the distance
from the lampposts on the corners of
Green and Taylor and Vallejo _and
Taylor streets to the Bpot
Blaise's body was found. He testified
that the distance from the pool of
blood found directly beneath the cut
in Blaise's neck to the stone wall on
the side of the Â«treet was exactly two
feet and ten inches, thus bringing the
tip of the man's head to a point within
two feet of the wall.
Russell said that the height of the
wall, measured from the spot where
Blaise's body was found, was thirty
seven feet and six Inches. This testi
mony was offered by the prosecution
in order that the defense might not al
lege that Blaise fell to his death from
the wall. A men falling from a dis
tance of thirty-seven feet -would be
precipitated farther into the street
than the rpot where the body was
found The testimony of the autopsy
turgeon will further bear out this fact
when he testifies that Blaise's body
xvas devoid of any bruises or fractured

of that Sunday evening, would have

The hcriiir.g went on slowly owing
To the prosecution not having been
fuljy prepared with the evidence in
Â¦the case. It was not comoleted and
at 4 o'clock the court adjourned to
1 1 . o'clock this morning:. The hear
ing was particularly devoid of any
testimony of an important nature that
has not already been published. Mrs.
Xeiblas changed her testimony, yes
terday, as Fhr- has dorre every tim^
sh"D has been called on to relate what
she knows of Soeder's movements.
She had previously stated that if Soe
ver had been in his room up to 10
o'clock on the night that' Blaise wo.s
murdered, as he alleged he was, she
Â¦would have seen the light from hi?
]';mp under the door that leads from
Deputy District Attorney James M.
Hanley prosecuted. District Attorney
nyington was present and during the
hearing offered suggestions. Detec
tive Thcmas Gibson sat next the peo
ple's attorneys.
As Soeder passed down the corri
dor he cast a sneering glance at the
curious that lined his way. He seem
ed cool and collected and throughout
the hearing listened intently to the
testimony of the various witnesses. He
occupied a position between his at
torneys and Detective Armstrong, ani
several times d.uring the recitation of
thu facts of the case by the witnesses
he smiled, the testimony seeming hu
morous to him.
L^on Solder, charged with the mur
der of Joseph Blaise, his brother-in
l^.w. after insuring the latter's life in
hys own behalf, was led. handcuffed to
a detective, through a surging crowd
of people into Police Judge Cabaniss'
courtroom yesterday to b^sin the or
deal of his preliminary hearing.
The hall and the corridor leading
the courtroom were jammed with
a curiously inclined mob of people
that rwayed and crushed in an at
tempt to get a glimpse of the alleged
ir.urderer, or obtain access to the
courtroom. Several policemen were
required to force the people back in
order that the witnesses in the case
might pass ir.ride.
There was a wild and excited
f -mmble among the morbid people
that lined the way to see this man,
< harmed with one of the most cold-
Mooded and mysterious crimes of the
year. Soeder was handcuffed to De
tÂ«rtivÂ» Armstrong, and other officers
valkÂ«?d close by the prisoner, who is
regarded by the police as a desperate
criminal.

Attend Court.
Hearing of Leon Soeder,
Accused of the Crime,
Is Begun.
Rays of Street Lamp Never
,* Reach Piace Chosen
for Foul Deed.
When the hearing was over Soeder
called Attorney Salomon and told him
that the police insisted on keeping him
in a dark cell anjd treated him as a
convicted criminal.
Salomon was wroth and said that in
court to-day he would complain of the
manner in which the police have been
treating his client. "I have always un
derstood," said Salomon, "that a man
is innocent until proven guilty, and 1
do not think that the police have any
right to keep Soeder in a dark cell until
they have^proven this charge of mur
der .which Hhey have entered against
his name."
Judge Cabaniss was not much Im
pressed at the evidence produced yes
terday, and said it would be necessary
for the prosecution to show more in
order to get Soeder bound over to the
Superior Court for trial.
Detective Gibson said that when Miss
Flatley was placed on the stand to
day there would be some startling tes
timony. The Call has always alleged
that Miss Flatley was the most im
portant witness for the prosecution,
and it is known that the police rely more
on her than on any of the other wit
nesses in producing evidence enough to
get a conviction of Soeder. The Insur
ance men also are yet to be examined.
Mrs. Neiblas told of Soeder's many
trips to her house on the Monday in
question, and said that she saw him re
move from Blaise's grip what she after
ward learned were the insurance poli
cies. She told of Soeder's telling her
that he had seen Blaise's body at the
Morgue and his statement that he had
several times passed the spot \/here
Blaise was found murdered. She also
related how'* she 7 had' seen her husliand
try one of Soeder's shoes in the tracks
in front of Soeder's window, and said It
fitted exactly the imprints there. -
At this Juncture the adjournment was
taken.
Mrs. Neiblas told of her discovery of
a two-ounce bottle of chloroform on the
mantel in Soeder's room the day before
the murder, and said that on the Mon
day the murder was discovered it dis
appeared. Her testimony in regard to
Soeder's possession of a pistol was use
less, as she said she thought it was in
his overcoat pocket at 2 o'clock on the
Monday that the body was found. She
thought it was there because she had
seen it once before in the coat pockef,
and on Monday, at the time she testi
fied to, she says she brushed against
the coat in hanging it up and thought
the weapon was still there. It has been
shown that Soeder pawned the revolver
before 10 o'clock on the .morning of the
discovery of the murder.
"What did Soeder say when you told
him that Blaise was dead on Monday,
the 11th of January?" asked Hanley.
"He said, 'Go on: go 'way,' and when
my husband told him that Blaise had
been murdered he said, 'Great God!'"
answered Mrs. Xeiblas.
KE1T IX DARK CELL.
"Do you know what color of clothes
Soeder wore on the Sunday njght that
he left the house in company with his
brother-in-law?" was asked.
"I do not," was the reply.
"What time did they leave the
house on that day?"
"At ten minutes to 5. I heard the
door slam as they went out."
The woman then said that had Soedpr
returned by 10 o'clock on that night
she would not-have heard him, as she
was busy In the kitchen. She said she
went to bed with her husband at 10:15
and did not know whether Soeder was
in at that time. She testified that the
lamp in Soeder's room, which she had
filled on the Sunday of the murder,
showed next day very little evidence of
Laving burned. Little oil was gone.
Soeder has stated that he sat in his
room with the lamp lighted, waiting
for Blaise to come home.
the main her testimony was the same
as that she gave at the Coroner's in
quest on Tuesday, except the portion
which she revised about her ability to
tell whether Soeder was in his room at
the time he claims he was on the night
of the murder.
"Could you see a light under the door
between your room . and Boeder's?"
asked Hanley.
; "I - could not if the portieres were
drawn," responded Mrs. Neiblas.
Mrs. Neiblas testified that Blaise al
ways wore a blue suit and that Soeder
wore a gray suit on the day that he
secured the room in her house, but
wore black generally.

At the annual meeting of the Cor

Commodore E. F. Sagar occupied the
chair. The reports of the commodore,
the secretary and the treasurer were
read and approved.
The election of officers to serve
during the coming year resulted in
the unanimous choice of the regular
ticket, as prepared by 'the nominating
committee, consisting of ex-Commo
dores H. D. Hawks and T. F. Tracy
and Andrew Thorne. The following
are the officers for the coming year:
Thomas Jennings, commodore; John
C. Brick%ll, vice commodore; John H.
Keefe, port captain; E. J. Bowes, W.
A. Stringer, W. J. Hogg and Orlo
Eastwood, directors. The members of
the regatta committee are Thomas J.

Douglas Erskine. Votes of thanks
were passed to the retiring officers
for their services during the last year
and a special vote of thanks to
Charles Barrett,; who retires from the
office of treasurer after holding it for
six or seven years continuously.
After the meeting the members

THi: FIGHT BY ROUNDS.
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 27. â Jack
O'Brien and Tommy Ryan fought one
of the fastest six-round goes ever seen
in this city to-night and the Philadel
phian had a slight advantage. O'Brien
clearly outfought Ryan in the first
four rounds and in the fifth dropped
him with a hard blow to the jaw.
Ryan took the count of eight and
came up groggy. He saved himself
by clinching until he had regained his
bearings. A moment later Ryan drove
a vicious left to O'Brien's stomach,
which brought the Philadelphian to
his knees. Ryan seemed to regain
his wind as the round progressed and
landed repeatedly on O'Brien's stom
ach with vicious lefts. It was only
the gong that saved O'Brien from be
ing knocked out. In the sixth round
honors were about even, both men
having received severe punishment.
When the gong: sounded ending the
fight both men were in bad shape.
Near the close of the fifth round,
while O'Brien was on the floor, one of
the seconds threw up a sponge full
of water on him. Many persons were
of the opinion that this ended the
fight, but the referee would not allow
the claim. The men agreed to meet
here in a six-round bout for a $5000
purse, split equally, and under the
laws governing boxing in Philadel
phia no decision can be given. Un
der the conditions, however, each man
was careful and conscientious with his
training as if the championship were
at stake. O'Brien and Ryan weighed
in at 6 p. m. Th<? beam was placed at
1C0, but neither man budged it.
O'Brien came into the ring at 10:17,
accompanied by his seconds. He was
given a tremendous ovation.
Ryan came into the ring at 10:21.
He also was given a great reception.
In O'Brien's corner were Kid McCoy,
Joe Hasan and Billy McLaney, while
Hugo Kelly, Spike Sullivan. Frank
Barthy and R. Ferriti attended to
Ryan.
It was 10:25 when Referee Crow
first called the men to the center of
the ring for instructions. A moment
later the. gong: sounded and the battle
was on.
In the preliminary contests Tom Tay
lor won from Jim Kennedy, the fight
being stopped at the end of the third
round because of a bad gash received
by Kennedy over the left eye in collid
ing with Taylor's head. Danny Sul
livan was awarded the decision after a
ten-round battle with Joe Reilley.
The redeeming feature of the fight
the Italian put up was his ability to
Absorb punishment and the ' rapidity
â¢vy.ith which he recuperated after seem
ingly being pummeled into dreamland.
He was slow on his feet, misjudged his
vanRo constantly, launched his elbows
wildly and appeared creak when in ac
tion. Cordell was always the aggressor
f nd carried the trouble to his opponent
without rest. lie used his long left to
pood advantage, and his persistent jab
tnng annoyed and confused the Italian
pugilist.
In a forociouÂ« mix-up at the opening
Â«>f the oijrhth round Cordell staggered
Soig-er with a right to the jaw and kept
after his man relentlessly. He punched
the "iron man" for nearly three min
utes, during: which the Italian took the
rnunt twice and parted with consider
able gore. At the bell Seiger walked
iiÂ» his corner without a wobble and
< ame out spry for the next round.
Seiger opened the fight with a light
left to Cordell's stomach. But few
blows were exchanged in the initial
round and these were gentle. From the
sr-cond to the eighth round the mill
was without notable incident. Cordell
maintained a rapid jabbing and Seiger
continued to fall short with his swings
and occasionally fell in his efforts to
Ret wiihin the hitting: line. In the ninth
round the Italian tried uppercuts while
backing out of clinches, but Cordell
suffered no evident damage.
During the next five rounds the "iron
man" aroused himself, but could secure
no lead over his opponent in any of
ihem. Both came to the center quickly
ir. the final round. Seiger was short
v.ith his swings, as usual, and Cordell
5oon had his man dazed with alternate
swings to the jaw and stomach. When
the gong sounded both boxers were
flinched. Referee Eddie Smith did not
hesitate in pointing to Cordell as the
i\ inner. Behind the winner were Tim
McGrath, Al Neil. Billy Otts and Cy
clone Kelly. In Seiger's corner were
JJilly Roach, his manager; Jockey Wil
lie Dugan and Jack Smith.
" Cordell was a. 1 to 2 choice In the
betting.
"'Iron Man" Charley Seiger was bad

Cordoll, who was given the decision in
a fifteen-round bout that went the limit

O'Brien was holding: on when the gong rang.
It saved him from being knocked out. The
blow showed on his stomach where hard rights
and left landed. lie was in severe pain.
Round Â« â Both men came to the center
slowly. Ryan landed a left on O'Brlen'a face
and then tried a right to the etomach. but
failed to land. The men rushed to a clinch.

a left to the nose. O'Brien landed a right
straight to the Jaw and Ryan clinched. O'Brien

Ryan landed a left on O'Brien's wind and
the latter landed a straight on the jaw.

then landed with a straight right on Ryan's
Jaw. Both were fighting hard. O'Brien drove
right to Jaw and Ryan put left to stomach.
O'Brien missed a left and the men clinched.
Ryan led for the stomach, but missed, and the
gong ended the battle.
Hildebrand was to the front again
with three winning mounts.
Tommy Burns said he thought he
was going to leave the maiden class
Achilles should have won the closing
mile and a sixteenth run, but a bung
ling ride on the part of Kunz dropped
him in a close second. Byronerdale had
first call in the betting, and, carefully
nursed along by Hildebrand, earned a
neck decision. G. W. Trahern, the sec
ond choice, ran third.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
In a three-head finish with Isabellita
and Billy Moore marking the close of
the opening seven furlong event. Gar
net Ferguson's Lady Wadsworth took
the long end of the purse. The mare
had worked seven furlongs in 1:28*4, so
reported, on the strength of which she
was installed favorite. Away none too
well. Jack Martin, who had the mount,
early moved into a good position, and
at the end outfinished both Hildebrand
and Bell.
Dr. Rowell's colt Golden Idol showed
to be pounds the best of the starters in
the two-year-old scramble. The chest
nut youngster closed a slight favorite
over Edith Vice, which latter filly was
quoted at 11 to 5. Johnny Daly rode
Golden Idol, and he was kept busy
from the start in an endeavor to pre
vent tils mount going to the outside
fence. Even under these .adverse cir
cumetances he won by four open
lengths. Edith Vice ran second, more
than a length ahead of Morita.
EJj PILOTO Â¦ WIXS CLEVERLY.
El Piloto, at V& to 1. with Hildebrand
up, captured the seven furlong selling
number. The brown gelding assumed
the front position with half the route
traversed, and stalling off the chal
lenge of Marelio at the finish was a
winner by two lengths. Constellator
ran a good third. Velma Clark, with
Larsen on her back, opened favorite at
*2 to 1, and after receding in the betting
to 3tÂ» and 4 was never a contender.
Sidney Bender's colt Coroner Kelly,
equal favorite in the betting with
Waterspout, cleaned up in the six-fur
long sprint for three-year-olds. The
Coroner was backed by the smart set
and led from start to finish, beating out
Bombardier a length. George Berry, a
13 to 1 shot, led "Waterspout out for
show honors.
Gold Money ruled a 1 to 2 favorite,
while 12 to 5 could be had about the
Yeager entry. As O'Hagen and Esh
erin were outclassed, it was strictly a
two-horse affair. Hildebrand went
away in the lead with Waswift, Martin
waiting with the favorite about onÂ©
and a half lengths away. When the
bend for home was reached Martin
went to work, but found a difficult
task before him.
WASWIFT RESPONDS GAMELY.
Waswift responded to punishment,
and with the wire in sight Gold Money
showed signs of weakening. While
Wasuift bore out the last part of it he
did not falter, and won by a length in
1:39, the track record. O'Hagen fin
ished a fair third.
Favorites achieved more sucess in
the other events, capturing four of the
purses. The weather was warm and
balmy and the attendance large.
Gold Money, the supposed invincible
mare from the Jennings stable, met
with a rebuff at Oakland yesterday in
the mile handicap that came as an un
pleasant surprise to her backers.
Carrying Jack Martin and 109 pounds
she locked horns with Joe Yeager's
chestnut horse Waswift, and when the
race was over there were pasteboards
enough strewn about the ring to make
a bonfire.

Eddie llanlon and Kid Broad, who
are to fight twenty rounds to-morrow
night in Mechanics' Pavilion, under the
auspices of the San Francisco Athletic
Club, will select a referee to-night.
The rival boxers will meet at Harry
Corbett's at 8 o'clock to discuss the
matter. Eddie Smith of Oakland seems
to have the inside track at the present
time. Eddie Hanlon -would probably
prefer Smith over any one else, while
Broad apparently has no choice. From
what he says Hanlon is the man he
wants to see in the ringâ the referee
is useful, but he is a small part of the
Bhow, from his point of view.
Broad did some hard work on the
road yesterday morning and spent con
siderable time in the gymnasium in the
afternoon. He boxed with Cyclone
Kelly and pleased the experts who were
present. He has a good left hand and
hits a hard, straight blow.
As he is fighting Hanlon at catch
weights, that detail is not troubling
him. He weighs about 139 pounds. He
will cut out his heavy work to-day and
will turn his attention to fast boxing.
He will use a light punching bag and
will also do considerable shadow box-
Ing.
Hanlon has taken kindly to training
work and up to the present time has
shown no ill effects from his last fight.
He feels he must win to-morrow night,
as he expects to go East shortly, and
a defeat at this time would block all his
plans.

It is r i>w supposed that Wright's os
tentctious consumption of tabloids for
indigestion and insomnia during the
last days of JJie trial was dasjgned to
disguise, in'case of necessity, the tak
ing of the fatal dose. According to the
decision, the dead man prolonged his
agoi-y by taking too many of the po
tassium tablets, as a smaller dose
would have brought death moreswiftly.
All Wright's conversations with his in
timates and attendants during his last
days proves that he hoped until the
last for acquittal, al hough he made
such careful preparations for the
worst. Had hebeen convinced himself
that conviction was inevitable there
was nothing to prevent his committing
suicide previously, for ne was never
searched during his trial,' --M with the
exception that he was always shad
owed by detectives he h complete
freedom of movement.
With the consent of the Home Secre
tary, Wright's body will be handed
over to his relatives after the 'nquest,
for private burial at Netley, his home
in Surrey.
The revolver found on Ills person Is
of American make and of heavy cali
ber. It was concealed in his hip pocket
and, is an evidence of his strong deter
mination to end his life.
The Financial News says: "Wright
might have made disclosures which
would have seriously discomfited
some people, but he was loyal, as well
as courageous, and he carried his se
crets to the grave. To prevent others
divulging what he chose to conceal he
destroyed many papers, thus complet
ing his sacrifice."
It is reported that a six-chambered
revolver, fully loaded, was found in
Wright's pockets by the police.
At the post-mortem examination of
the body of Whitaker Wright his fea
tures showed no trace of the suffering
he must have endured before death.
His face was calm and peaceful. His
brain was found to have been Â«.bm -
mally large and as the examination
proceeded the doctors found evidences
of cyanide of potassium, which con
firmed their previous impression oT the
cause of death. Portions of the deadly
tabloids, still undissolved, were found
in the tomach, Wright having swal
lowed ieveral of the. ..
The possibility of the promoter's es
cape from justice by suicide was clear
ly foreseen by Detective Willis, who
brought Wright from New York. Act
ing upon hints dropped by Wright
during the voyage, Willis gave the
court officials especial warning to keep
the closest guard over him: Toward the
conclusion of the trial, especially dur
ing Justice Bigham's'severe criticism,
it became evident that there could be
only one verdict, so that if Wright was
determined upon self-destruction, in
the event of his conviction, he had time
to prepare a method for outwitting the
jailers, as he must have foreseen that
an adverse verdict was inevitable.
A strange document was found on
the seat in court which had been occu
pied by Wright, showing that he had a
premonition of his sentence. This was
a., sheet of blotting paper on which he
had scribbled during the Justice's sum
ming up. The Roman characters "VII"
were thickly scattered over the whole
sheet. This was before the verdict had
been rendered, but the number coin
cides with the sentence he received. In
the middle of the sheet appears the
word "intent," the last word Wright
wrote.
LONDON, Jan. 27.â Investigation
shows that Whitaker Wright commit
ted suicide by taking cyanide of potas
sium. Wright must have swallowed
the poison while standing before Jus
tice Bigham after receiving his sen
tence. It is recalled that Wright drew
a handkerchief from his pocket and ap
peared to vlpe his face and it is sur
mised that under cover of this he took
the fatal dose. The inquest will be held
to-morrow.
The post baseball team crossed bats
with the visiting team from the Ninth
Cavalry, Ord Barracks, yesterday, the
home team winning out with a score
of 14 to 7. .
The new roster of troops rf the De
partment of California is now in the
hands of the printers, and Major John
R. Williams expects to have it ready
to be issued the latter part of the
week. The roster embraces the names
of all commissioned officers serving in
this department, which includes the
States of California and Nevada and
the Hawaiian Islands.
The tea to be given by the ladies of
Presidio Barracks in the hoproom of
the post to-morrow afternoon between
the hours of 2 and 6 o'clock promises
to be a most delightful entertainment.
The affair is under the management
of Mrs. C. Morris and Mrs. J. B.
liawles. The musical portion of the en
tertainment is in charge of Miss Mor
ris and Miss Ragles, who have pre
pared a most interesting programme.
In the afternoon the team
from the Ninth Cavalry at Ord Bar
racks will play against the officers'
post team. In this team will be Cap
tain James W. Hinkley, Captain G. P.
Whi.j, Lieutenant John H. Howard,
Major Robert C. Van Vliet, Lieutenant

Lieutenant Augustine Mclntyre, Lieu
ten: \ Edward M. S!-inkle, Lieutenant
Claude E. Brigham and Lieutenant
Victor C. Lewis.
Lieutenant Beauford R. Camp, Ninth
Cavalry, will act as superintendent of
the sports, and as he is thoroughly up
in athletics a good morning's entertain
ment is assured.
The events that comprise the pro
gramme of the regular monthly field
day games that begin aÂ£ 9 o'clock this
morning are of a particularly interest
ing character. Besides .the usual run
ning and jumping feats and relay races,
a sp-.-ial feature will be the mounted
athletic contests. In these events the
field artillery and cavalry will partici
pate and these should form one of the
most interesting parts of the pro
gramme.
The cavalry drill and maneuvers at
the Presidio yesterday morning showed
the troops to be in fine condition. Ma
jor Bigelow, the commanding officer,
who was on the field in charge of the
squadron, expressed himself as highly
pleased with the work of his command,
both individually and collectively.
Since Major Bigelow took* command,
three weeks ago, the troops have been
in the field every day, except Satur
days an"d Sundays, for several hours,
and the result of this work is shown by
the fine display the squadron made
yesterday. They were put through a
pretty stiff drill, including many more
or less intricate evolutions, and when
they dashed across the big field-under
full gallop with the bright guidons
waving in the morning breeze, theyi
presented a stunning appearance.
Following the main drill came the
pitching of the Sibley tents. In this the
squadron showed great dexterity. In
less than five minutes after the signal
was given to commence pitching the
tents every tent was up. What had
been a plain, smooth, clear field was
now changed into a position to house
a small army .of men. From the sud
denness and dispatch with which the"
work was executed it looked as if a
lot of big mushrooms had suddenly
sprung up. Â¦ * (
At the conclusion of the exercises the
bugles sounded recall and the troopers
galloped off the field to the stables.
The sq.uadron \taking part in the
drill is composed of Troop I, Captain
Cftarles Young; Troop K, Captain John
T.i Nance; Troop L, Captain f:hn B.
Chri:. ian, and Troop M, Captain Lester

Facing; the Justice After
Hearing Sentence Pronounced
Swallows Fatal Dose While
Take Place This Morning on
Parade Grounds at Presidio
Monthly Field Day Games Will
It was a question of whether three,
treys beat four aces in a game of raz
zle-dazzle that caused George G. Scott
and Samuel Johnson, two negroes, to
be arrested on charges of disturbing
the peacg. They tangled up in strangle
holds in discussing the question and
Policemen Shein and Holmes had to
undergo puzzle punishment in separat
ing them.
They were before Judge Conlan yes
terday to answer to the charge. In
the interests of justice the Judge leaned
over his high bench an<T" asked Clerk
Rice whether or not in such a game
three treys did really beat four aces.
He took no chances of walking around
and discussing the question on the
ground floor for fear that his innocence
might not be a shield for him. Rice
looked up with his bright blue eyes and
acknowledged that he knew nothing
about such things.
Only from surface indications both
defendants were found guilty and or
dered to pay a fine of $5 to the cause
ot justice.
When she appeared before Judge
Conlan she was defiant. "I'm an In
dian," she said, "and you can't do any
thing to me." "I'm something _of an
Indian myself," said the Judge, "and
I belong to the same tribe when oc
casion demands. I'll find you guilty
and the amount of torture will be com
mensurate with your Indian lineage."
Miss Roach from The Needles went
back to the dock and will be sentenced
to-day.
Agnes Roach came up from' the
Needles, a town on the Colorado River,
where enterprising citizens have made
the desert bloom as a rose, to weep
over the remains of a dearly beloved
aunt. She even went to the extent of
carrying her grief to a saloon on How
ard street, and between woe and mixed
drinks she became a nuisance.
On this occasion he discovered that
eight men from Berkeley had crossed
the moat and were trying to kill him.
He thought that if he could discard
his clothes he would disguise himself
from his pursuers. For that purpose
he secured a ladder, climbed from
roof to roof, shedding garments as an
eagle drops a feather in its flight,
some of which were found i in the
rooms he invaded in his attempt to
escape the Berkeley men. Despite
his explanation he was held on the
charge of burglary on bonds of $2000.
William Noon, the midnight burg
lar, had a preliminary hearing before
Judge Mogan yesterday. C. Hauser,
who lives at 503 Mason street, testi
fied to finding the missing coat of the
defendant in his room, and a neigh
bor, in the person of a French, land
lady, said that she was startled by the
sound of a man's going through her
trunk.
Much against the advice of his
counsel High Noon took the stand.
He confessed to the Judge that for the
last twelve years he had been addict
ed to the use of cocaine. On the. par
ticular night for which he was arrest
ed for the crime of burglary he was
engaged in the occupation of seeing
that the ferry clock was wound, thu
moon taken in and the town locked
up for the night. On other occasions,
he said, when he delegated his du
ties to others he found the moon
dampened by fog.
Sproat was handcuffed by the bai
liff when he was brought from the
City Prison and he protested strongly
against such treatment. He wanted
to walk into the courtroom under a
silk canopy. When he was shut up
in the dock with the common prison
ers his indignation knew no bounds.
Neither the Judge nor court officials
will ever buy a turkey from him for
less than the wholesale price.
He was arraigned and his bail fix
ed at $2500 cash or $10,000 in bonds,
and then he was conducted back to
the City Prison with the hateful hand
cuffs still upon him. v
Samuel Sproat, one of the brothers
who is accused of defrauding whole
sale merchants out of $60,000 while
conducting a market at Seventh and
Market streets, appeared before Judge
Cabaniss yesterday on the charge of
feloniously obtaining goods under
false pretenses.
refused to recognize the plea and fined
the man with the terrible name 510.
Michaeletti Michaeletias was be
fore Judge Mogan yesterday on the
charge of cruelty to animals. "Is
that your true name?" asked the
Judge. "It is," answered the defend
ant, through an interpreter. * "That's
prima facie evidence of guilt," said the
Judge, as he leaned back to listen to
the testimony.
Officer Hooper of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
testified that Michael â let , us forget
the painful remainder of the name â
unmercifully whipped his horse on
Mission street and at every lash of the
whip pronounced his own name. It
took three hours for the humane of
ficer to pick the bristling diphthongs
from the animal's hide. The whip
marks were merely incidental cruelty.
The attorney for the defense offered
to prove that the cruelty was merely
'a case of somnambulism. He said
that his client could not sleep with
a name like that, and in his laboring
moments he drowsed and dreamed In
a fighting mood, - unconsciously mak
ing the horse the victim. The Judge
? â¢ â¢
Giovanni Fossa was held to answer
without bail by Judge Conlan yester
day on 0> charge of manslaughter for
fhe death of Vincenso Lavaginino,
His co-defendant was released, the dy
ing statement of the deceased man
having exonerated Rossi.
Nicolo Pasteni was a peculiar wit
ness during the preliminary hearing
and he didn't have sense enough to
make a get-away after he had deliv
ered his story to the recording angel
of the court: He was present in an
attentive attitude during yesterday's
hearing, and the fudge's eagle eye
spied him in the throng that perme
ated every seat and aisle of the
courtroom.
"Bring that man up here," said the
Judge, pointing to Pasteni, who was
idling over the rail -with a fellow
countryman. 'â¢Commit him to custody
for perjury. It is about time that
these Italians began to understand the
value of an oath delivered in a court
of law in this -country- His testimony
was one of the most unmitigated
pieces of perjury I have ever heard,
and I hope the record of it will be
sufficient to send him to the peniten
tiary for a long term."
Pasteni testified during the hearing
that he met a woman on Van Ness
avenue for whom he rolled a cigar
ette. While doing so he saw Rossi and
Fossa carrying a burden, which he af
terward ascertained to be the uncon
s'dus form of Lavaginino. "Under
questions from Judge Conlan the tvit
ness was unable to state what lan
guage the woman spoke, whether she
was tall or short, and finally did not
know whether she was black or
white. When he faces a perjury charge
in the Superior Court he may sit up
and take notice of things.
"In my experience as a Police Judge
for more than six years," he said, "I
have found that fully 50 per cent of
the women prisoners are more sinned
against than sinning. Unscrupulous
men, insufficient nourishment, ignor
ance of the tolls that vice collects in
the long run and, above all, laziness,
are the principal causes of crime among
women. Any one "of these causes can
be corrected in a large measure by a
properly conducted institution, in my
opinion, where a woman can find rest
for a time from the struggle for ex
istence ard have a chance to gather
her womanhood together. When this is
done manv of them will realize that
a resoeotable life, even though it be
accompanied by labor, is infinitely more
preferable than being the scum of the
earth and the plaything of men infin
itely worse than themselves.
"There are many charitable organ
izations in this city which pretend to
care for unfortunate women, but none
of them does. This latest proposition
appears to me to be exactly what is
needed, and I hope you will receive
whatever support you need that may
be beyond the private means you are
now devoting to the work."
Two unfortunates were turned over
to the women representing the new
organization. The derelicts will be
cared for ur.til they secure positions.
If either of them stray from the nar
row path Judge Mogan will use the
ordinary judicial reformatory measures
in her case. Even though nine and
ninety fail, it would be worth while
to save the hundredth, and the wo-men
interested in the mission are positive
that many of the wanderers from the
fold of goodness can be made respect
able women.
Judge Mogan promised all his sup
port and sympathy to the proposition
and agreed that any woman appearing
in his court on any of the minor
charges for which most of the unfor
tunates are arrested will be turned over
to this new organization for possible
reformation. He said , he would
remember those who were incor
rigible and when tney were re
ported back as again violating the law
he would deal wijh them as ordinary
criminals, whom kindness could not
cure of their vices.
Several prominent and charitably'in
clined women called on Judge Mogan
yesterday to discuss with him the ad
visability of caring for the large num
ber of unfortunate and fallen women
who appear daily in the police courts.
They told him that they purposed to
try to make some salvage from the
innumerable wrecks of womanhood
that daily fail into the hands erf the
police, and for whom the Police Judges
have no alternative except dismissal
or a sentence in the Oounty Jail.
The good Samaritans have gone about
their work systematically. They have
secured a home in Alameda. rather
small for the demands that are called
for, in which they will shelter as many
as can be cared for. They hope soon
t^ enlarge the quarters and interest
others in the charitable -work, so that
a commodious refuse shall be estab
lished in this city. For more than two
years they have been working in this
line, but the fallcrn- field of the police
courts for such a mission has been over
looked in favor of rescues from the
streets and voluntary surrenders on the
part of the few miserable women who
had the good fortune to hear of the
refuge.

Charles J. Ellis, a young real estate
Â¦*;-vk in the employ of David Bush &
Spn. orvt^d his life in a dramatic man
::er shortly after 7 oYlock yesterday
morons at his homer 1623 Sutter street,
by sending a bullet through his brain.
Kliis terminated his career without any
sipp^i-ent reason, and the only cause
irm ran he assigned for the rash act
Is^ that ho was temporarily deranged.
He was married to a wealthy woman
two years ago and was happy in his
domestic relations. <
He was apparently in the best of
.health and spirits up to the time that
he sent the fatal bullet through his
brain. He attended the theater with
his wife on the previous nieht and
asked her to call him at 7:15 o'clock.
She did p<r and arose at the same time.
H*' asked to be allowed to sleep a few
moments longer. His wife then left
the room, only to be startled a few
moments later by the sound of a pistol
shot.
On entering: *t he room, she found her
tusband lying wounded in the bed, with
a 3S-ca!iber revolver clutched in his
right hand. The pillow was powder
stained and the bullet had entered the
jrffi&C tPEiple, coursed its way through
ih^'head. penetrated the adjoining wall
ai:d Indeed in the next room.
Dr. Charles V. Crot?? was called to
'he bedside of the sufferer and. as
sisted by Drs. Wilhelm and Etcheverry,
n'i operation performed with a
yÂ»Â»w to savinc life. The wound was
f.-ual. however, and Ellis died soon aft
er the operation.
Ellis left r.c- note of explanation, and
his .vnung wife is at a loss to know
why her husband should have chosen
t*Â» Â«>nd an existence that was appar
>rÂ«!y as happy as any man could wish
for. '
EJIiP was about "1 years old and
came to this city some two years ago
from I'kiah, vh"re his mother and his
f=:s=ter now reside. He was a man of
hap'dsnme appearance and well liked
*oy all who knew him. He was a mem
ber of the Elks and very popular among
The members of that order. Mrs. Dora
< ifd*-neamp and Mrs. Mary Jenkins of
thrr-city were his aunts.
He was married a little more than
a year ago and took his bride to Eu
rope for a wedding tour. Since his ar
r'val here ho had been in the employ
of Bush, ar.d his position netted him
sn arr.z>l<* allowance. His widow is
prostrated by the sad event. His rela
tfves arrived from I'kiah last night to
tatke charge of the remains.

Passes Fictitious Checks.
Two warrants were secured yester
day from Police Judge Cabaniss for
the arrest of S. P. Bowen, an insur
ance agent, on charges of passing
fictitious checks. Alexander Karons,
grocer, 174 Jessie street, and Joe Po
heim, the tailor, are the complaining
witnesses. Each alleges that .Bowen
passed a cjieck on him on Tuesday for
$10 drawn on the First National Bank,
payable to- himself and purporting to
be signed, "John G. Grayr manager."
Both checks wore presented for pay
ment nt the bank and marked worth
less. Bowen was arrested by Detec
tive Whitaker and Policeman Tiliman
and booked at the City Prison.

Hickey Calls Greene's Bluff.
Attorney Thomas Hickey of the firm
of Cullinan & Hickey, attorneys for the
new Public Administrator, M. J. Hynes,
created quite a sensation in the court
rooms of Judges Sloss andTroutt by say
ing that Carleton \V. Greene, attorney
for former Public Administrator John
Farnham, had made a misstatement
when he said' in court, that he had filed
counter petitions to those of Hynes in
several estates. Greene admitted that
at the time he made the statement he
thought the petitions had been filed,
saying that he had sent them out to
the County Clerk's office by messenger.
Greene attempted to apologize to
Hickey, but the latter refused to pay
any attention to the attempt to smooth
matters except to say that the apology
was due to the court, j

The probate proceedings attendant
upon the estate of the late Thomas J.
Clunie were further complicated yes
terday by the filing of a petition for
partial distribution of the estate by E.
A. Bridgford and Burrell G. White.
two of the executors of Clunie's will.
They ask that the court distribute to
them the property deeded to them in
trust for Jack Clunie. the adopted son
of the deceased (the Clunie building);
the $20,000 devised to them In trust
by the deceased for his two brothers.
James and George Clunie, and the
property on the corner of Golden Gate
avenue and L,eavenworth street left
to them in trust for Thomas J. Clu
nie. son of Andrew J. Clunie. They
say that the condition of the estate
is such that a partial distribution such
as they pray for will not affect or re
duce it to such proportions that it
will not be in condition to pay any
claims that may be presented against
it. The petition will be heard Tues
day. February- 9.
The petition shows that the rela
tions existing between Bridgford and
White and Andrew J. Clunie. the
other executor, are not very cordial,
for it contains the announcement that
Clunie has refused to join with them
in the request for distribution. It
appears to be a of retaliation, for
White and Bridgford opposed Clunie's
petition for distribution to him of the
Sacramento realty devised to him ia
his brother's will.

About seventy jackles from the Bremerton
navy-yard were passengers on the steamship
City of Puebla, which arrived yesterday from
Pujret Sound. The sallormen were bound for
Mare Island, and Captain Jepsen of the Puebla
hopes there wlft be enough work at the navy
yard to tone down the high spirits of. tho
men in blue. Seventy jackles released from
service discipline and beyond the reach of
authority for fifty odd hours know a good
many ways .of putting in their liberty. In
the draft of men brought down by the. Puebla
were some of tho most ingenious souls In the
enlisted branch of the naval service. Im
mune from seasickness, they devoted the lonn
hours to leading their fellows Into mischief,
and Caotain Jensen and his officers had a
merry time. They played tricks on the pas
sengers; they bewitched the electric lights;
their horseplay and noisy laughter stampeded
couples on the spoon deck and their critical ob
servations dampened the ardor of the obliging
amateurs who volunteered contributions to so
cial hall concerts. The last and greatest of
fense was the baiting: of a Japanese whom
they compelled to take the part of a hare,
while they played hounds. Captain Jepsen
Interrupted the hunt after the Japanese had
Riven some thrilling exhibitions of agility.
He ordered the sailors forward and promised
each a pair of handcuffs and leg irons if bet
ter order was not maintained. Being well
trained as well as high spirited the men In
blue bowed before the captain's authority and
restricted their gambols for the rest of the
trip.

The Commissioners were not able to
decide as to the lowest bidder on an
acceptable process of preservation, and
discussion arose as to .. whether the
award could be deferred until the next
regular meeting. Former Governor
Budd, the legal adviser of Mr. Dundon,
suggested that the board could take a
recess and consider all the proposals.
He did not contend Uhat the award
should be made on the day that the
bids were opened, Mr. Dundon de
scribed to the board successful experi
ments in preserving timber by a pro
cess of injecting oil and asphalt into
the woofl.
There is a common impression on the
water front that the teredo welcomes
a change of diet and feeds with great
avidity on the new ingredients offered
for the preservation of submerged piles.
Dundon, however, insists that a piece
of wood properly treated with oil and
asphalt will resist the attack of the
most ferocious sea worm.
Consideration of the bids was post
poned until next Wednesday.
Proposals as follows for repairing
ferry slips were opened: S. D. Leclair,
$22,081 25; Healy, Tibbetts & Co., $20.
961 30; Darby Laydon, $22,864 35; City
Street Improvement Company, $21,
535 65; Hyde Construction Company,
$22,165 50; Dundon Bros. Construction
Company, $21,908 97; James A. McMa
hon, $22,023 15; Thompson Bridge Com
pany. $21,366 75; Cotton Bros.. $22,293 80.
The board awarded the contract to
Healy, Tibbetts & Co.. the lowest bid
ders.
Bids for preserving piles were also
opened. The figures ranged, from 19
cents to 40 cents per lineal foot, ac
cording to the thickness of the timber
at the butt. The bidders were H. R.
Root & Co., the San Francisco Timber
Preserving Company and the Paraffine
Paint Company.. The two last named
bidders based proposals on new pro
cesses of preserving the timber.
COUIjD XOT DECIDE.
W. C. Van Fleet, counsel for Foster
& Orear, attended the session of the
State Board of Harbor Commissioners
yesterday and requested that his cli
ents, who are holding the news stand
privileges at the ferry depot, should
be given thirty days' time to vacate
the premises should the board decide
against their offer of $1500 a month for
the concession. Commissioners Spear
and Klrkpatrlck said the board had
no intention of dealing harshly with
Mr. Van Fleet's clients, but the com
mission had doubts about the propriety
of making a stipulation that might
bring about complications. President
Spear remarked that "the commission
would charge a rental at the rate of
$1200 a month for any extension of time
beyond the period of the existing con
cession. Mr. Van Fleet said that Fos
ter & Orear would pay at the rate of
$1500 a month, and would not attempt
to create complications. Colonel Kirk
patrick remarked that the commission
did not want to get confused.
The board took a recess until next
"Wednesday. Mr. Van Fleet was as
sured that his clients would not be hus
tled out.
PROPOSALS RECEIVED.
Sailors in general and sea cooks in
particular will be interested in a decis
ion handed down yesterday by United
States District Judge de Haven in the
cases of William Herbold vs. Union Fish
Company and Herbold vs. M-Collam
Fishing and Trading Company to re
cover balances alleged to be due as
wages. The court said:
"I am satisfied from the evidence
that libelant did not properly discharge
the duties of cook, for which he shipped.
and the master of the Volant would
have been Justified in assigning him to
a different service, but waa not justi
fied in discharging him from the ves
sel against his consent and leaving him
in a distant port. Capillo vs. Bristol
Packing Company. 112 Fed. 43S. The
receipt signed by the libelant does not
purport on its face and was not intend
ed to operate as a release of the Volant
for the master's breach of contract. It
is a receipt in full for wages up to
date, 'and of all demands for assault
and battery, or imprisonment of what

The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Alameda, Captain Dowdell, which
arrived from Honolulu Tuesday even
ing too late to pass quarantine, was
released early yesterday morning and
docked immediately at Pacific street
wharf. Continuous head winds held
the Alameda back and caused her to
be late, something: that has seldom hap
pened to her during all her years of
service.
She brought about 150 passengers and
a cargo of tropical products, which in
cluded 10,506 sacks of sugar, 4947
bunches of bananas and 6633 sacks of
coffee.
C. L. Patton, the well known local
lawyer, who, with Mrs. Patton, has
been visiting the islands, returned on
the Alameda. The passengers included
the following named:

The circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"There has been a slight increase. In arrivals
of Hay for the week ending to-day, the total
a mount ins to 2000 tons, er" 100 tons more
than tor the week preceding. Town trade has
hardly, warranted any increase in shipments,
but -the excess has been required for Govern
ment purposes. A small shipment has already
been taken for Manila, and preparations are
now being made to forward the balance of the
larpe order recently placed here. It must ba
understood tbnt the Government requirements
are for small bales or Hay highly compressed.
which necessitates the handling of- the Hay
several times over. The continued dry weather
ia exciting considerable comment as to the
future of the market, but as Is generally the
case there has befn no further advance be
cause of fairly heavy receipts. Regardless of
the outlook the Hay market generalises utterly
Insensible to future prospects, being regulated
each day by that day's shipments. So until
either the scarcity of Hay In the country or a
threatening drought materially reduces the
dally bhlpments there wvjl probably be but
Htile change. From the present outlook Hay
will have to be shipped rather sparingly, or we
will not have enough to last us through. Every
thing, therefore, points toward higher prices
a bit later, especially as the entire coast
seems to be short of Hay. and already Hay
that was purchased for shipment here Is being
diverted to other points. We would not be at
all turprUed to see choice Wheat Hay sell as
high as $20 within another month.
"We can quote no chance from the prices
given last week.and arrivals still consist chiefly
of (food grade wheat and tame oat Hay."

In tbe wheat rlt to-day waÂ« â¢ the u?ual ac
tivity and comparative strength of the July
delivery. Way exhibited much nervousness and
was easily Influenced by any little trade either
way. Quietness - was noticeable, at the rtart.
there being few orders on the market. The
opening dullnÂ«fÂ« was the result of a convic
tion In the minds of the pit crowd that so long
as one firm vtood ready to bny all that was
for sale on May delivery It was useless to at
tempt trading. Easier cables caused a slight'
Iof* in initial sales. May being a shade to
H^Hc lower at 89%c to 89t,c. Light offer-
Ings with a fair scattered demand soon caused
an advance to 00%c. There was fairly good
commiwl.tn house selling on' the upturn and
the market Â¦ soon reacted. The July delivery,
however, retained much of the early strength,
the supposition being that It was leys under
the control of the long operator. The extreme
coid weatber throughout the winter wheat belt
hrought out a good" demand for this option,
with outsiders buying freely. From SltyÂ®
81 9iC at the opening the price advanced* to
82%<ff82 i >iÂ«.\ The close on May was weak and
%c lower at .sa%'S89%c.
There was Rood buying of corn early by :Â«ad
ms ;ommiEs!on houses, due partly to the
strength in wheat and partly to the strong
tone of cables.
Oats, were firm the greater part of the day,
ck-sin? He higher at 42 %c for May.
Linuidation by small holders and'eellins by
packers caused some weakness In provisions.
The cksÂ» was easy. May >x>rk being 7%c
lower and !ard and ribs ."ii57%c lower.
- The leadlne futures ranged as follows:

The Orange market does not seem to respond
to the warmer weather and stocks of all grades
of Navels are still far in excess of the demand.
Some dealers reported a little more movement,
but the majority of the trade continued to re
port a dull market. There, was practically no
inquiry for small or medium sized fruit, large
Navels only being wanted, and the large sizes
of strictly fanpy were still held at a small
advance over the quotations. The attendance
at the Orange market was small and the sale
passed off in the usual humdrum fashion.
Seven cars of fairly attractive fruit were sold
as follows: Fancy Navels, $1Â®1 75; choice,
OOcigl 50; standards, 40c@?l 20. Lemons.
Limes and Grape Fruit were unchanged. The
Panama steamer brought up 245 boxes Mexican
Limes. Hawaiian Bananas were quoted higher,
small bunches being cleaned up. The steamer
Alameda. which arrived on the preceding day,
brought up 4947 bunches.
Prices of Apples were without quotable
change. Trade was moderately active and
strictly fancy Newtown Pippins had the most
call.

No more Western Poultry came in. but them
were quite a few coops on hand that had been
carried over from the preceding day. Receipts
of domestic stock were light and good young
fowl moved off well at. sustained prices. Old
Hens were plentiful and moved slowly- owing
to the competition of Western stock. Two cars
of Weat'erri fall due to-day. Dressed ' Turkey*
arrived freely and met with a- sluggish demand
at unchanged rates. Only the very best stock

Burglar Story .Exploded.
The "bold" burglar in the residence
of Asa M. Simpson, the millionaire
lumber man, at 2200 Pacific avenue,
concerning whom a taje of daring was
told in an afternoon paper, seems to
have been a myth. According to the
story of the police he was a friend of
the. family, who, in a period of intox
ication, raised what is commonly
termed a "rough house," and police
men were, sent from the North End
police station to eject him from the
premises. Mrs. Simpson, when inter
viewed, told the story of the burglary.
Sergeant Campbell, however, says the
disturbance was created by a man
who is well connected and whose
name is withheld from publication
and that when Police Officer John
Morgan brought him to the station he
was, released after he had promised
to go home. The story that Miss
Edith Simpson found a burglar in her
room and held, him until the arrival
of the police is thus exploded.
Miles Court Is Private Way.
The Supreme Court declared yester
day that Miles court, a cul-de-sac on
property at the no'rtheast corner of
California and Powell streets, is a pri

purchasers of his property. Mrs. So
phia Oilflllan fenced off a portion of
the passageway and Phoebe Shattuck
objected. The Board of Supervisors
declared the alley a public thorough
faro and Mrs. Gilfillan sought the aid
of the courts. The lower court de
cided in her favor and that judgment
is affirmed by the Supreme Court.

indorsed this movement, as well as the State

ENCOURAGED BY PUBLIC.
The National Industrial Peace Association
hap been organized and incorporated, not in
haste nor at the prompting" of thoughtless im
pulse, but after a careful and thorough Inves
tigation of the work already done throughout
the States of Oregon and Washington and a
rareful and Intelligent canvass of public opin
ion In San Francisco, all of which goes to
fhow that the' employers and employes and
the general public desire to end the Incessant
struggle foV supremacy that has bean waged
between capital and labor and carried beyond
the endurance of a generous and indulgent
public.
We are convinced from the evidence pro
duced under the eeal of the most Intelligent
and conservative trades unions representing
varied branches or Industry, and the written
Indorsements of national trades union presi
dents and official labor papers, that a great
majority of the labor men are In sympathy
with the effort we are about to make In behalf
of harmony and the submission of all future
disputes to arbitration without the disruption
of business.
i An organization under the name of
the National Peace Association, with
headquarters in this city, has been
formed with the avowed purpose of
harmonizing the differences between la
bor and employer. The board of direct
ors is composed of the following well
chosen men and women, whose posi
tions fit them thoroughly to act as a
barrier against aggression on one side
and oppression on the other. They are:
George H. Foulks, president; M. J. Kel

second vice president; General Theo
Reichert, treasurer; P. H. Scullin, sec
retary and manager; Rev. George C.

MOVING VIEWS OF STREETS.
While the money part of the San
Francisco enterprise is receiving at
tention. Secretary Colburn says that
San Francisco will make a first-class
exhibit on its own account. In addition
to the great map of the bay of San
Francisco and of all points upon its
shores, there will be a great array of
moving and stationary pictures, pano
ramas, etc., that will illustrate San
Francisco commercially and as a man
ufacturing city, and will also point out
all its characteristic features to the ex
position crowds that visit the San
Francisco building.
FIRST-CLASS EXHIBIT.
The fund for the San Francisco exhibit
at St. Louis is coming in so well that
Secretary Colburn says there is no
doubt that the money that is necessary
will be raised. The appropriation of
$15,000 by the Supervisors of San Fran
cisco will pay for the building that the
city will erect directly opposite the
main entrance to the exposition
grounds. Probably there will be raised
by subscription not less than $5000 this
week. The clearing-house system of
getting the needed coin to put San
Francisco in the forefront of individual
California counties showing at St.
Louis is working well. Letters are be
ing cent out from the headquarters of
the executive committee for San Fran
cisco in which banks and business firms
and capitalists are informed what the
committee expects to receive. No esti
mate made by the committee of the ex
tent of financial support which indi
vidual business houses or banks will
be willing to give to the cause has been
reversed.
A representative of the Pavers' Union
addressed the board regarding the bad
condition of the pavements adjacent to

stated that there was a lockout of pav
ers by the United Railroads and the
work of repaving had been neglected.
The board will communicate with the
corporation with a view to having the
track portions of the street put in good
condition.
The board refused to grant a permit
to the California Stevedore Company
to blast on the northerly half of Lortl

The petition of the California Steve-,
dore Company for permission to grade

upon adopted a resolution appointing

The board appointed Russell L. Dunn
special assistant engineer for the Spring
Valley Water Company Investigation
and the fixing of water rates by the
Board of Supervisors, with special dow
er to represent the Board of Works at
the investigation in connection with
the city engineer. Dunn's salary was
fixed at $150 per month. Commissioner

made: Elevator operator, J. H. Camp

Questions regarding the accuracy of
the appraisement occupied some time.
Mr. Oelrichs when asked if it were not
a ijLCt that while the estate was ap
coraised at about $3,000,000 it was worth
tumble that amount was unable to give
a definite answer. He said that the
estate consisted of ranches, mines and
city property, the value of which fluctu
ates from time to time and it is im
possible to estimate exactly what it
was worth at the time of the death of
y'ir. and Mrs. Fair. He reiterated his
statements made at the previous ses
gion that the parents of Mrs. Fair had
been dealt with honestly and nothing
kept from "them which it would be Id
th*>ir advantapp to know. The hearing
vrill be resumed Monday, when one o*
the physicians who performed the au
topsy will be called.
None of the legacies enumerated in
the wills of Charles L. Fair a 3d Mrs.
Caroline D. Fair have ever been paid,
but they have been purchased by Mrs.
Oelrichs and Mrs. Vanderbilt and the
amounts represented by them turned
over to the legatees.
Mr. Oelrichs 6tated that he was op
posed to an autopsy held on the bodies
of Mr. and Mrs. Fair. On the advice of
.tis attorney. Reuben H. Lloyd, he had
consented to have an autopsy per
formed. At that time the Tritnees had
Just finished the long litigation over
the estate of James G. Fair and In
crder that no bogus claims be intro
duced he followed the advice of his"
attorney. It was not held, however,
â¢with any viw of determining yhich of
the parties died first.
Hermann Oelrichs occupied the stand
during the taking of depositions in the
Fair contest before Court Commissioner
Hosroer yesterday. He was subjected
to a rigid cross-examination, during
the course of which he stated that ha
did not know whether or not Joseph
Harvey ran a poolroom at Sausalito.
EC Charles L. Fair had any money on
deposit either in this city or in New
York at the time of his death the wit
uess knew nothing regarding it, as the
amount on deposit here was carried by
an overdraft.

From the center of the ivory ceiling,
studded with yellow lights, hung a
gigantic basket, freighted with branches
of bamboo; above it a bamboo raft
was suspended, holding aloft lanterns
of deep yellow and an infinite number
of Chinese flowers. These hung in long
strands, their gaudy lengths waving
over the g*ay throng as if bestowing
benisons upon it. Palms,, cool and se
ductive, rose here and there about the
ballroom, and at the far end stood a
temple gate â it might have been Con

music makers sent forth merry melody.
