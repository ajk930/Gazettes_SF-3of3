"WASHINGTON, Aug. 15.â The report
that Postmaster McKay of Des Moines j
T.'iil ask for permision to employ Â¦'
Â¦women mail carriers has been heard 'Â¦
with interest in the postal department. \
The sentiment in the department is
Â«trongly against employing women
farriers, but a careful search of the
regulations made to-day showed that j
there was nothing there to prohibit ;
them, except that, according to the j
regulations, they would have to wear ,
trousers if employed.
â¢ In the list of appointments made to- j
day in the rural free delivery service Â¦
the names of three women appear, but
Postmaster McKay's proposal to en
gage women as city carriers will be
discouraged when his request for per
mission rearhes Washington.
McKay declares that he has found
the women to be mr-re prompt, trust- i
Â¦worthy and capable than men in other J
positions fn the office and he believes I
â¢they would prove so as carriers.
Thf department officials may fall
back upon that section of the regula
tions which deals with the uniform re
' quired In order to debar women. This
section is plain and unmistakable in
Its intention to apply to men only, as
it refers without reserve to trousers,
waistcoats and coats. One para
rraph, however, might apply to both
sexes â thÂ« one In which letter carriers
art permitted to wear "shirt waists"
during hot summer months.
"The examination for physical quali
fications also might prove a stumbling
â¢block for women," said an official. "AH
applicants are put through a very vie- j
orous examination to prove their j
strength. One of the qualifications is
ability to hoo a certain distance from
the floor on one foot twelve times i

was attacked "with a fainting spell.
He was able, however, to overcome
this weakness and caught up with his
company. He managed to continue on
the march until within about 100 yards
of his company street, where he was
again overcome and fell to the ground
in front of the camp of the provisional
infantry.
The soldiers endeavored to assist
him, but before medical aid could be
obtained he expired.

GUATMAS, Mexico, Aug. 15.â The

turmoil over the outrages being perpe
trated by Yaaui Indians. All trains
and stages leaving Guaymas axe ac
companied by military escorts and de

Yaqui prisoners for deportation give
the city a warlike appearance.
The trouble is still confined to the
district north of Guaymas and rein
forcements have arrived from Hermo
sillo, bo that the authorities are confi
dent^ of being able to keep It from
spreading.
The last killing was that of Crescen
sio Mavtorena. a trader, who was am
bushed near Batomatal. The Yaquis
shot him down, cut out his heart and
plundered his wagons. The following
day Eugenio Campillo and Jose Ver
dugo, who set out to learn the fate of
Maytorena, were attacked by the sav
ages, but they used their rifles to ad
vantage in holding back â¢ the Indians
and their swift ponies carried them to
a place of safety.
The party which set out from San
Jose de Guaymas under the leadership
of Alejandro Roma, in pursuit of the
slayers of Maytorena, overtook them
at the Aguila ranch, where the dozen
members of the band had just been
driven back bv the. proprietor and a
few. vaaueros. The Indians were sur
rounded, but Ojo Bla'nco, or White
Eye, a famous Yaqui, who was at the
head of the band, made a desperate
effort to break through the ranks of his
pursuers. He and his eleven compan

taken prisoners. Ojo Blanco, who Is

his companions will be deported.

The King's speech proroguing Parlia

visits to the King of Denmark and the
German Emperor, at which he said his
reception In each case was most cor
dial, and the agreement between
France and Great Britain, which he
pointed out will be advantageous to all
concerned and materially strengthen
the friendship between Great Britain
and France, the King said:
Hostilities, I regret to pay, are still in prog
ress between Rueala and Japan. Upon the
outbreak of the war I Issued a proclamation
disclarinK my neutrality and enjoining all my
people to a strict observance thereof. Im
portant questions Involving the treatment of
neutral commerce In the hands of belligerents
have arisen In connection with these opera
tions. The Issues ln%-olved, which are of the
gravest moment to the trade of the empire,
will, I trust, be amicably settled without
prejudice to the vast commercial interests of
the country. Jly Government will energeti
cally support my subjects in the exercise of
rights recognized by International law as be
longing to neutrals.
In regard to Tibet the King said that
the arrival of the '.'political mission" at
Lassa afforded him the greatest sat
isfaction and reflected considerable
credit on the officers and the small
number of men of the force. He hoped
the conference in Lassa would result

SAN JOSE, Aug. 15. â Professor
Charles H. 'Allen, for seventeen years
president of the San Jose State Normal
School, is seriously ill at his home in
this city. Saturday he was attacked
with a hemorrhage of the lungs and
for a time his condition was critical,
but his physicians now hold out hopes
for his recovery.
No man is better known among the
school teachers of the State than Pro
fessor Allen. He was the first presi
dent of the school. For the last six
years he has been assistant postmaster
in this city.

The opening of court, however, was
marked by unusual and dramatic in
cidents. The room was so crowded by
spectators that the Sheriff was unable
to clear a space for the prisoners. He
finally called on the soldiers for help,
and a company of men with fixed
bayonets marched around the court
room and forced the crowd to give
way.
STATESBORO, Ga., Aug. 15.âGuard
ed by armed troops and surrounded by
a great throng of excited citizens, thir
teen negroes, members of the Â¦ "Before
Day Club," the existence of which was
made known by one of its members
under arrest, were placed on trial here
this afternoon for the murder of Mr.
and Mrs. Henry Hodges and their
three children. There had been much
talk of lynching, but there was no
open outbreak and the local militia,
reinforced by a company of sixty men
of the First Regiment from Savannah,
had little difficulty In preserving
order in the streets around the Court
house.
Soldiers, with fixed bayonets, were
stationed every three feet from the
court entrance to the jail and after
waiting half an hour the prisoners, es
corted by more militiamen, were
marched to the jail, around which a
strong guard was posted.
All the evidence against Cato was
submitted and the case closed by 7
o'clock to-night and the jury retired
at ten minutes after seven. The jurors
returned a verdict of guilty eight min

After the prayer the minister ad
dressed the throng, pleading with
those present to uphold the court in
its every action. It was, he said, a
sad mission which brought him to
Statesboro. If it had been another's
brother who had been murdered, he
declared, he would have felt more an

The Grand Jury reported indictments
against Paul Reed and Will Cato for

twelve miles below here that has tied
up all traffic. Forty-eight passengers
were out all night on the desert on
account of a delayed train. No lives
were lost, but there has been heavy
damage inflicted on the railroad and on
other property.
In and about Tonopah and Goldfield
there have been heavy Tains all week.
The Tonopah Railroad has b&en a

Should the Dubois resolution fail,

that ex-Senator Henry Heitfeld of

us almost certain to be nominated for
the Governorship, will withdraw In

of all factions. It is unlikely that any

L.EWISTON, Idaho, Aug. 15. â Con
sideration of the Morman question is
to-night blocking the proceedings of
the Democratic State Convention,
which met here to-day. United States
Senator Dubois, who was defeated as
a delegate in his own county and suc
ceeded in "being chosen from Custei
County, proposed a radical anti-Mor
mon resolution. His resolution has
been softened to denouncing polygamy
and the mixing of church and state,
and promising to favor legislation to
carry into effect these views. The
prospect now is that this resolution
will be defeated and the national
Democratic plank be simply reaf
firmed.
T. P. O'Dowd and C. Flannlgan,
both of San Francisco, are candidates
for the office of State secretary, with
the chances in favor of the former, it
is said, while M. H. McCafferty is said
to be pretty sure of being elected State
treasurer. M. Desmond of Oakland is
said to have practically a clear field
for the office of State vice president.
R. C. Curtain is looked upon as the
successful candidate for State presi
dent, although the name of v "YV. F.
Gromley, who has a strong following,
has been mentioned as a probable can
didate.
The members of the order assembled
at Sierra Hall, where they were wel
comed by W. F. Gromley and Rev.
Father J. Ellis. After the roll was
called the members took a recess to
attend mass, which was celebrated by
Rev. Father P. F. Brady at the Cathe
dral of the Blessed Sacrament. To
morrow they will commence business

tains a person's nutrition by enabling one
ffo eat, retain, digest and assimilate the
proper nutritious food. It overcomes the
gastric irritability and symptoms of indi-
gestion, and thus the person is saved from
those symptoms of fever, night-sweats,
headache, etc., which are so common. A.
tonic made up largely of alcohol will
ehrink the corpuscles of the blood and
make then weaker for resistance.
"This is to certify that I have used Doctor
Pieree's Golden Medical Discorery. think it's
the grandest medicine ia the world," writes Mrs. j
V. BL Young:, of Weir. W. Va. "I had dyspepsia
in its worst form. I decided to try your med-
icine. I used fiÂ»e bottlea. and now I am doing
ray own housework. A number of my friends
also are using Dr. Pierce'B medicine and they
recommend it highly. May God bless you in
your grand work."
Dr. Pierce believes that a tonic made with
alcohol will ehrink the red blood corpuscles
and make the system weak for resistance;
Jthat is why he avoided the use of any alco-
ihol or narcotics in his "Medical Discovery,"
ivrhich contains the pure extract from roots
land herbs without a particle of alcohol.

RUSSIAN' RATTKRIES CAPTURED.
The battleship Imperator Alexander
III is by far the most powerful vessel
of the squadron and is one of Russia's
newest ships. She belongs to the Boro
dino class and was launched on the
Neva In August, 1901. and is of 13,516
tons displacement. She was designed
for 18 knots Bpeed. with 16,800 indicated
horsepower and coal capacity of 1250
tons, equal to 8500 miles, steaming at
10 knots, or 3000 miles at full speed.
The Alexander III is a twin screw
battleship, 397 feet over all, of 76 feet
beam and 26 feet draught, which would
give no trouble in getting through the
Suez Canal. She has a complete belt
of Krupp steel, four inches thick at
each end and nine Inches thick amid
ships, with a protective deck and splin
ter deck and KruDD steel bulkheads.
Rear Admiral Enkvist is in com
mand of the cruiser division, which is
expected to sail first, and Rear Ad
miral von Felkersan of the battleship
division.
Just what vessels will actually con
stitute the Baltic fleet now about to
sail is nearly as much of an uncer
tainty as what vessels are available of
the fine fleet that was on the scene
at the. beginning of the war.
The fleet sails in two divisions, with
Rear Admiral Razhdestvinsky in chief
comma.nÂ£. It consists of two divisions
âbattleship and cruiserâ with smaller
vessels, colliers and torpedo craft ap
portioned to each.
Chance of war and elements may,
however, yet favor the effort, and even
the prolonged uncertainty of the final
outcome, as affecting the supplies of
food and war materials for her enemy,
will count for Russia in the immediate
future and the yet undated end of the
great struggle.
Following right on the heels of the
several naval engagements in Far East
ern waters, reports of which yet leave
doubt as to the fate or fighting effi
ciency of several of the best ships of
the Pacific division of his lately proud
navy, Czar Nicholas has given the or
der for the Baltic fleet to sail for the
scene of action. It is, perhaps, with
the hope of retrieving lost ground and
fallen prestige; but only in trusting to
remote chances of war can this ac
tion, based on such a hope, be Justified.
With three or four exceptions as to
the larger fighting vesselÂ§r now about
to depart from the Baltic, the flower
of Russia's navy was already in the
Orient. It has already met the enemy
In several conflicts and sustained hon
orable defeat, with serious loss, if not

AXU NAVAL, OFFICERS WHO
WILL, BE IN COMMAND.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 15.â The
cruiser division of the Baltic squadron
has received sailing orders. Some of
the vessels have already left Kronstadt
and others, including the Oleg, will
leave in a few days. The division may
go around the Cape of Good Hope,
where It Will meet colliers.
The battleship division Is awaiting
Ihe completion of the lepairs to the
Orel, and is not likely to start for a
week or a fortnight.
Orders have been issued that all tor
pedo-boats and destroyers of the sec
ond division shall be coaled to full ca
pacity. The boats are to await further
orders in the small roadstead at Kron
stadt. Shore liberty on all vessels has
been curtailed after sunset.
The Navarin goes back farther still
in date and is as a fighting craft con
siderably slower and weaker. She was
launched as long ago as 1891 and is of
9500 tons displacement and 9000 horse
power, with a highest possible speed of
15 knots. . The Navarin carries six tor
pedo tubes. She is manned by 630 of
ficers and men.
The Boridlno, Kniaz Suvaroff and
Slava, the first of the same class as
the Imperator Alexander III, will
doubtless sail also.
The Aurora is a first-class protected
cruiser, built In 1900, of 6600 tons and
20 knots speed, mounting right 6-inch,
twenty-two 3-inch and eight smaller
quickflrers and fitted with four torpedo
tubes. She is a sister ship of the Diana
and Pallada.
The Svietlana is a small twin screw
protected cruiser of 3S23 tons displace
ment, built at Havre in 1896. Her coal
capacity is 4000 tons, equal to 7000
miles at ten knots. For protection she
has only deck armor of Creusot steel,
from 9 to 1.7 inches thick.
The Admiral Nakhimoff la an ar
mored cruiser of 7782 tons. She goes
back to 1885 for the date of her launch.
The Dmitri Donskoi was originally
one of the Admiral Virenius* squadron.
She Is one of the earlier Russian cruis
ers, built under the great naval pro
gramme that Russia Initiated after the
Berlin Congress. The Dmitri Donskoi,
launched in 1883. Is a ship of 5900 tons.
The Almaz is really a dispatch ves
sel, or an exceptionally armed emer
gency cfwfSer. Her displacement Is
6250 tons and engine power 18,000 (In
dicated), giving her 23 knots at full
speed. â¢
Other cruisers not yet named will
probably be with this division.
f Besides these principal vessels there
are a number of smaller ones, whose
names and number are as yet not
known generally. A rendezvous for
the whole fleet has doubtless been
selected already, in near approach to
the ' war zone, where coal and provi
sions will be. in waiting to recuperate
the -men and put the vessels in good
condition for the inevitable conflict
that awaits them. '
The Oslabya is a new first-class bat
tleship, launched at the new Admiralty
yard, St. Petersburg, on November 8,
1898. She is a sister ship to the Pol
tava and Peresviet (both at Port Ar
thur), and is of 12,674 tons displace
ment and 14.500 horsepower, designed
to give her 18 knots speed.
The Sissoi Veliky (Sissol the Great)
is an old ship and of another type. She
Is ten years old, having been launched
in June. 1894. She is a second-class
battleship of 8880 tons.
She has four 12-inch guns (firing 720
pound shells) in her main turrets,
which are protected by 11-inch armor,
ana twelve 6-inch quick-firers in pairs
in seec-ndary turrets of 6-inch steel on
the bow, beam and quarter. Besides
these there are on board twenty 12
pounder quickflrers in casemates,
twenty 3-pounders and eight 1-poun
ders, with six torpedo tubes. The Alex

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 15.â The
Emperor has received the following dis
patch from Viceroy Alexieff, dated
August 13:
"According to a report from Port Ar
thur on August 10 the Japanese at
tacked Taku and Siachou mountains
in enormous force during the night of
August 9 and occupied them after fif
teen hours' fighting on the night of
August 10. During a heavy rainstorm
the Japanese attacked our east front,
but were repulsed at all points. They'
also attacked simultaneously our whole
front from "Wolf Hills to Taku Moun
tain, but everywhere were driven back.
The fortress has been bombarded from
the east side for four days."
The War Office to-day received a
message from Port Arthur in which
General Stoessel, under date of August
11. reports a successful repulse of a
general asault on the Russian outer
positions during the night following the
departure of the Russian squadron. He
does not mention a naval engagement
or refer to the return of the warships.
The Admiralty has received a tele
gram from Captain Matousevitch of
the Cesarevitch, now at Tsingchou,
saying he is recovering and that he has
received a visit on board the Cesare
vitch from a Prussian Prince, who came
in behalf of the German navy to salute
their brave Russian comrades.

CHEFU. Aug. 15.â That a general
land and naval attack was made on
Port Arthur to-day is indicated by in
formation from various sources. The
statement that the naval attack was
made at ,4 o'clock in the morning comes
from an authoritative, but not diplo
matic, quarter.
Junks which arrived here to-day say
the Japanese recently occupied the
Liauti hills and Bushiyen, which is two
or three miles north of the fortress.
Five warships and seven torpedo
boat destroyer?, according to the junks,
returned to Port Arthur on the night
of August 10.
Refugees who arrived here to-day,
having: left Port Arthur on August 12,
brought reports that the Japanese oc
cupied new positions on that day. The
liring at Port Arthur was heavy, but
intermittent, and Indicated that the
assaults were being continued. The
Russians at Port Arthur are reported
to be downhearted.
The men v.-ho came in on the junks
declare that the commander of the
Japanese fleet before Port Arthur in
formed the Russian commander of the
place that if the warships which re
turned to the harbor after the sortie
of August 10 were sunk by the Rus
sians the Japanese would shell the
town with lyddite.
A Chinese who has arrived here from
Liaoyang declares that the casualties
in the recent fighting in that vicinity
have been enormous <>n both sides.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 15.âRe
ports ran through town during the day
that Admiral Togo was dead and that
Port Arthur had surrendered. The pa
pers here are trying to keep up excite
ment over the Ryeshitelni incident, but
Port Arthur occupies the public mind
to the exclusion of all else. It is fully
realized that the capture of the fortress
is possible at any time. 'The departure
of the fleet, including even the hospital
ship, was General Stoessel's signal that
the supreme moment of the defenders
was imminent. Public opinion is being
prepared by being reminded constantly
of the overwhelming: force of the Japa
nese, who are continually being rein
forced, whereas Russia can neither
replace the men killed nor the ammu
nition expended. The Japanese have
100.000 besiegers and 450 guns, of which

decisive effect on the result of the war.

TOKIO. Au*. 16.â Admiral Togo re
ports that it appears certain that a
vessel of the type of the protected
cruiser Pallada was torpedoed and
sunk In the engagement of August 10.
Admiral Kamimura, in his detailed
report of last Sunday's victory over the
Vladivostok squadron, says:
"At .dawn on -Sunday morning 1 * the
armored cruisers Idzumo, Captain Iji
chi; the Adzuma, Captain Fujll; the
Tokiwa, Captain Yoshimatsu, and the
Iwate, Captain Taketoml, while en
gaged In a search off Ulsan, Korea,
discovered three of the Vladivostok
squadron steaming southward. Seeing
us, the enemy endeavored to flee north
ward. We immediately closed their re
treat.
"The engagement opened at 5:23 a.
m. The Rurik, being the slowest of
the enemy's vessels, was
left behind and she formed a target for
our incessant fire. The Rossia and the
Gromoboi gallantly attempted several
times to protect the Rurik. They fre
quently returned to the Rurik and
when united the .three advanced to
gether. Our fleet thus had the advan
tage, pouring its flre from a forma
tion in the shape of the letter T. The
enemy's ships were seen to be on fire
several times, showing thereby that
they were heavily damaged.
"The Rurik was finally disabled and
her flre weakened. She began lower
ing in the water, listing to port. The
Rossia and Gromoboi finally aban
doned the Rurik.
"Just then "Cur fourth detachment,
consisting of the protected cruisers
Naniwa, Captain Wada, and the Ta
kashiho. Captain Mori, arrived and at
tacked the Rurik, while our squadron
pursued the Rossia and Gromoboi.
Severe fighting continued for five
hours. The Rossia and Gromoboi
escaped to the northward at full speed.
"At 10:19 a. m. our squadron
changed its course to starboard and
went south in search of the Rurik. In
the meantime the Rurik had been sunk.
Our ships 'steamed over the locality
and succeeded in saving 600 members
of the Rurik's crew. Our damage was
not serious. The spirit of our men was
excellent."
Admiral Kamimura was on the Id
zumo and Vice Admiral Uriu com
manded the fourth detachment.

PREPARING FOR A RETREAT.
BERLIN, Aug. 16. â A dispatch to
the , Lokal Anzeiger from Liaoyang
indicates a .belief in ; the retirement
farther north of the Russian army.
The dispatch says that the Russo-
Chinesc Bank at IJaoyang is preparing
to remove to Tielinghaien, and that the
bank at Mukden is apparently about to
close.
The authorities, the dispatch says,
have heard that 1200 Chinese bandits
are preparing to sack Liiaoyang as soon
as it is evacuated by the Russians.
The Llaoyang correspondent of the
Tageblatt estimates that the Japanese
forces in the field number 320,000 men.
of whom 100,000 are now in front of
Port Arthur.
BOSTON, Aug. 15.â For the thirty
eighth tlms since the Civil War thÂ»
survlvlnng veterans who fought In the
Union army assembled to-day In an
nual encampment, gathering In Bos
ton. The encampment of the veter
ans, as well as of the subsidiary or
ganizations, including the National
Woman's Relief Corps, the National
Daughters of Veterans, the National
Sons of Veterans and other organiza
tions, was formally opened to-day.
The American flag was seen every
where and red. white and blue bunt
ing was shown from the fronts of busi
ness houses, hotels, theaters, newspa
per offices and residences, from ona
end of the city to the other. There
were fifteen events scheduled for to
|day, principal of which was the pa
rade of the Union ex-prisoners of war.
Massachusetts Naval Brigade, Jackles
and marines from the warships in Bos
ton harbor, and others. Of this pa
rade the men of the Grand Army of
the Republic were to be spectators.
Their own bisr parade is to be held oa
Tuesday, with business sessions latar
in the week.
Commander in Chief John Ci Black
of the Grand Army to-day assumed
active, command of the creat encamp
ment. â¢ A conservative estimate of the
people in this city on account of the
encampment placed the number at
100,000. with the likelihood of another
hundred thousand for the veterans*
parade to-morrow.
To-day's parade was scheduled to
move at 12 o'clock. The chief marshal
was Captain Don Read, U. S. N. The
parade started from the corner of Com
monwealth avenue and Arlington
street and passed through the princi
pal down town streets.
At the State House, where the deco
rations are particularly approprlato
and beautiful, the column war: re
viewed by Governor John L. Bates,
with members of his staff. At the
City Hall Mayor Patrick A. Collins
and the City Council reviewed the
sailors and the veterans, while ths
procession passed in review before*
Chief Marshal Read at the corner of
Beacon and Charles streets.
One of the striking 1 features of the
day was a reception which Governor
Bates held in honor of a party of dis
tinguished Southerners, all ex-Con
f^derate officers, who are attending
the encampment. Captain Edward S.
Gay of Atlanta, Ga., responded for ths
Confederate?, expressing the deep
gratification that exists through the
South with the friendly act of a
Northern Grand Army Post (Edward
Kinsley No. 13 of Boston) In inviting
himself and comrades to come and
break bread with them during the en
campment.
The annual convention of the Na
tional Army Nurses' Association, wltTi
the president, Mrs. Addie Ballou of

The convention adopted as its of
ficial emblem a badj-e designed by
Mrs. Ballou. a medallion representing:
a nurse caring for a wounded soldier,
with the words "Civil War" above and

President Ballou's annual address
was a plea for an official and fraternal

The San Francisco Bridge Company

reservoir, and a force of men had been
employed on the work. Shortly before
5 o'clock, without previous warning, a
portion of the roof came crashing down
upon the three men, burying them be
neath a mass of twisted timbers. Fel
low workmen rushed to the scene and
the three were soon extricated from the
debris. The ambulance was summoned
from the Park Hospital and the injured
were removed to that institution. Dr.
Stevens, the surgeon in charge, found
that Stone was suffering from internal
Injuries and shock and Harrington had
two ribs fractured in addition to a scalp
wound. Graham was brought to the
hospital in an unconsciovrs condition,

may be necessary to save his life.

Germany Takes Possession of Vessels
That Put In at Tsingchon.
TSINGCHOU, Augr. 15.â The Russian
battleship Cesarevitch and three tor
pedo-boat destroyers are now in the
hands of the local German Government
for repairs, but it is improbable that
these vessels will figlit again in this
Â¦war.
Captain Truppel, chief of the military
and civil administration of the protec
torate of Xiaochou. after having com
pleted provisions for the neutrality of
the crews of the Russian warships dur
ing their stay here, went on board the
Cesarevitch. The crew of the battleship
was alarmed at the advent of Captain
Truppel's party and seized its weapons.
It was quickly quieted, however, and
the commander of the Cesarevitch was
informed that it was necessary that the .
Russian flag be hauled down and re- j
main down pending the completion of!
the repairs. The Cesarevitch's flag was j
then lowered amid impressive formali- j
ties, after which Captain Truppel vis- j
Ited each of the three destroyers^ whose j
flags also were lowered. ;;- '~
It is believed that the Russian cruis
ers Pallada and Diana have reached

Owing to the absence of Supervisor
Homer at Sacramento, in whose district
the Infected animals are, no action was
taken, the matter being continued un
til he can be present and give his ad
vice.
I understand that the owners refuse to de
rtroy the reacting animals and I most respect
fully recommend that your honorable board
instruct the veterinarian now employed By
you to place the animals In strict quarantine
until such time as they can again be tested
with mal'.ein. I also respectfully suggest that
your veterinarians keep close watch for other
cases of glanders In the neighborhood and
wtere these horses have been used.
I beg to Inform your bonora.b!Â«Â» body that
this office hai ascertalnÂ«d through Dr. George
Donnelly of Oakland that a contagious and
infectious disease exists among certain horses
In the county of Alameda. Upon Investigation
of Drs. Donnelly and Donaldson it wai shown
that glanders existed among the horses of
Messrs. Manuel and Joseph L*wi*. who live
near Onterville. One horse showing unmis
takable symptoms of glanders was immediately
destroyed and when fifteen horses that had
teen exposed were submitted to the rcallein
test & diagnostic agent used for the detection
o( the disease, eight of them reacted.
State Veterinary Surgeon C. H.
Blemer made a report to the Board of
Supervisors to-day and recommended
the quarantining of a number of
horses in the vicinity of Centervllle.
He states it has been ascertained that
glanders actually exists there. One
horse has been killed and several more
are afflicted with the disease, but
the owners refuse to destroy them.
These he recommends be quarantined,
and in this connection says:

Captain Winn finds fault, too, with
the size of the drill grounds, the
amount allotted for the support of the
military department and the manner
of instruction to cadets. The drill
grounds, he finds, contracts the move
ments of the command, so that none
of the larger evolutions can be exe
cuted In exact conformity to drill reg
ulations. The 52600 allotment for the
support of the department is too small
for such a command and should be
Increased. Regarding the drill, Captain
Winn believes that it is too much to
expect efficiency with less than fifty
practice days in the year, with student
officers changing every year, and he
suggests that the commandant be as
sisted by permanent paid Instructors,
the same as in other departments of
the university, if the best results would
be obtained.
I take It that the discipline la not severe
enough to maintain efficiency among many
who lose interest after a few months' drill
None of the privates out of the ranks seem
to salute an officer, r.or were they called to
attention by their cadet officers en the ap
proach of the commandant.
The execution of Inspection of arras was
generally poor, and the weak, nervous way In
which the rifle was handed to and received
from the inspector indicated lack of practice,
strength and self-confidence, which I assume
Is characteristic of tha individual work 'of
the privates.
Some of the companies went through the
simpler movements with a degree of accuracy,
vim and smoothness approaching a high de
gree of drill efficiency, while in others there
was slackness, listlessnees and general Inat
tention on the part of the privates, as well as
a lack of knowledge on the part of the of
ficers and non-commissioned officers.
At the outset Captain Winn proceeds
to give high praise to Captain Henry
de H. Waite, professor of military sci
ence at the university and commander
of the two regiments* for the good re
sults that he has obtained with the
student soldiers under adverse circum
stances. These results he finds mani
fest in the "extremely good spirit that
pervades the student body in respect to
the military department." Continuing,
he says:
Professor Wait* | 9 entitled to tpecial credit
lor bringing about and pn-^orving this most im
portant condition of euetess in a jreat
tÂ»ody of students of the diversified Interest and
r.abits that obtain at the University of Cali
fornia. The cadets were promptly formed and
thereafter went through the various exercises
In which they have received Instruction. They
went through the'vartous movements in a bus
inesslike, spirited way that reflects credit
upon the scope of the insiructicn and upon
ihe teoeral interest manifested by the stu
dents.
All the students were in the prescribed unS
.orm, and. with few exceptions, their cloth
ing; predated a clean, neat-fitting appearance,
and the cadets themselves locked clean,
healthy and active. Many cf the cadet officers
impressed me as extremely successful in their
military -work, and it is quite remarlabio that
they accomplish so much.
In marked contrast to this extrava
gant praise is the criticism that creeps
into the tail end of Captain Wlnn'a
report. Here he furnishes particulars as
numerous as the items on a plumber's
bill. With all the things that he
praised in the beginning he finds at
K-ast one flaw worth calling to the
attention of the War Department.
tor instance, Captain Winn flnds that
the cadets that "looked clean, healthy
and active" also "persistently and con
tinuously drooped their heads while
marching," at least the great majority
of them did. Instead of being erect
and soldierly, most of them, with the
exception of the freshmen, are round
shouldered, thin-chested and absolutely
lacking in that character which is cov
ered by the term "a military bearing."
Many of the cadet officers, who before
appeared as "extremely successful in
their military work." now make mis
takes that "show, a lack of practice
in the forms* of instruction." Contin
uing; he says:
The cadets prewired reasonably well the
position of a soldier while the Inspector was
ia front of thorn, but immediately after he
passed to another organization many of them
turned their heads about, talked and other
wise entirely disregarded the requirements
of the position of attention, which infraction
the cadet officers apparently took no stepÂ«
to correct. It ia evident the importance of a
soldierly bearing and conduct in the ranks is
understood, but that many of the cadets think
it sufficient to maintain such bearing only
while they think they are under critical ob
servation.
Captain Frank L. Winn finds much
to praise and some to condemn in the
conduct cf the student soldiers at the
University of California. In a report
as inspecting officer for the Pacific di
vision of the United States army that
he has just filed with the War Depart
ment Captain Winn expatiates at some
length on the good and bad points of
the cadets as he observed them when
he inspected the university regiments
just before the last commencement.

A fugitive from justice for two weeks.
Earl A. Sargent, a student at the Uni
versity of California, surrendered him
self to justice this morning and is now
prepared to stand trial for committing
a number of petty larcenies. Klepto
mania will be Sargent's defense, thouglt
it is understood that the prosecution
will not be pressed severely against
him, so that his punishment will be
light, whatever it is.
Sargent is the young man who took
a quantity of jewelry and wearing ap
parel from the house of Benjamin Dal
lerup, for whom he was working as a
carpenter to earn money to carry him
through the university. When the po
lice finally discovered that Sargent was
the thief they traced him to his house
at 1625 Leroy avenue, where all the
stolen goods were recovered under pro
cess of a search warrant.
While the officers searched his effects
Sargent made good his escape, although
he had greeted them in the front yard
when they arrived. The officers appre
hended him late the same night while
he was visiting his mother, but he es
caped a second time because they did
not take the precaution to handcuff
him.
This all happened two weeks ago,
and the police have been waiting for
his return ever since. He slipped into
town again to-day, however, without
them seeing him. having determined to
remain a fugitive no longer, but to face
the consequences of his act. Before giv
ing himself up to the law he sought an
interview with Dallerup, his victim,
with the result that he secured a prom
ise that he would be punished as lightly
as possible. Then he surrendered to
Justice of the Peace Quinn of Oakland,
who fixed his bail at $200 and accepted
his bond for the amount. The charge
is petty larceny.
"I feel like a man Just waking up
from a dream," said Sargent, with
tears streaming from his eyes. "I re
member things only In a vague way.
If I took things that did not belong to
me it was because I was not responsi
ble. I must have been crazy. That's
the only way to account for it. But
I've come back now to take my medi
cine."
The case of Sargent is most inexpli
cable. A college-bred man. a man with
a good mother, whom, he supported
from his own labor, the owner of some
property and apparently surrounded
with the best influences, he suddenly
stepped aside from the path of right
eousness. There seemed to have been
no incentive to steal, for besides hav
ing considerable means of his own, the
things he took he could not sell and
did not attempt to sell. His conduct Is
explained only on the ground that he Is
suffering from a mental disease akin to
kleptomania.

was not, familiar with either the law
or the facts involved, resulted In
Judge Lacombe's decision. His deci
sion contains no reasons showing how
it was reached and in it not one au

believe it should be given great weight

case under advisement.
Korsgren left his room at 712 Ma
son street Monday morning-, August
7. at S o'clock. Before his departure
he paid Mrs. John A. Daniels, his
landlord, what he owed her for room
rent and gave a small nickel watcH
which he carried to her little boy.
Daniels says that Korsgren often
talked of killing himself, as he said
that he was no good to any one and
no one liked him. He says that the
deceased was a heavy drinker and had
no money to amount to anything when
he left Monday.
Korsgren was a silversmith em
ployed by Shreve & Sons. He was a
member of the Swedish Society. The
man had evidently been dead for five
or six days,, decomposition having al
ready set in.
So steep was the cliff where the
corpse was found that the Coroner's
deputy had to obtain the assistance of
the crew of the Golden Gate Life
saving Station to recover the body.
Daniel Korsgren, a Swede, was
found dead yesterday at the base of
a hish cliff, between the tunnel on

the Finance Committee.
M. H. de Young filed a petition that
the present building ordinance be
amended so as to increase the height
limit of class A or fire-proof buildings
from 201 to 220 feet. De Youns state3
that he is desirous of erecting an ex

Kearny and Market streets, and he
finds it*- difficult to erect the building
within the present height limit.
City Attorney Long sent a communi
cation to the board to the effect that
the abstract of title to South Park fur
nished to him Is incomplete, in that it
does not contain abstracts of deed of
George Gordon to Timothy Ellsworth
conveying an undivided one-twenty
sixth interest in South Park, and also
another deed conveying a one-twe*nty
sixth interest. Lonj thinks there may
be others and asks for a complete ab
stract of title. Three claimants to four
twenty-sixths interest in South Park
have already petitioned for their share
cf the $20,000 appropriated by the city
to purchase the park.
The petition of the Atchlson, Topeka
and Santa Fe Railway Company to
construct a- spur track for the purpose
of connecting Its yard system of tracks
In China Basin with the tracks of the
United Railroads at Fourth and Ken
tucky streets was referred to the Street
Committee. The spur track is to be
used to facilkrte the interchange of
business with the United Railroads.
The petition states that because of the
locality where it is desired to construct
the spur track the public will not be
inconvenienced thereby.
Grades were ordered established on
Quince alley and Filbert and Manches
ter streets.
The petition of Dr. C. F. Buckley
that "Market street be lined with a
small strlns of small Turkish bazaars
and that Van Ness avenue, for four
blocks, be turned into old-time mining
dumps to remind visitors of our palmy
days" was referred to the Street Com
mittee. â¢
The ordinance providing for a grant
to the Southern Pacific Company of a

It was announced that the city offi
cials of San Francisco and contiguous
counties wil! hold a meeting next Fri
day afternoon at 3 o'clock to consider
the question of the acquisition of a
joint source of water supply.
The board adjourned to meet on
Monday, September .19. . Under the
charter, sessions must be- held every
Monday, so it was agreed that one or
more members of the board meet each
Monday and adjourn the meeting to the
successive Mondays until the date
named, when the board will again
meet to transact business. The office
of the board will remain open to re
ceive petitions and for other business.
The Board of Works was directed to
examine into the condition of the
Channel street sewer property, owners
having complained that it Is choked up
and a menace to health.
Chief of Police Wittman petitioned
that a number of old ordinances be re
enacted, as the subject matters are not
covered by the Penal Code nor by the
existing ordinances. Wittman says he
finds it highly essential to the peace
and welfare of the community that
they be put in. force. The petition was
referred to the Judiciary Committee.
Chief of Police Wittman has sent a
communication to the Board of Super
visors calling attention to the fact that
although numerous arrests have been
made for the violation of the ordinance
prohibiting the selling of pools or mak
ing bets on horse races, the Police
Judges hold that it is necessary to
prove that the horse upon which the
bet is made ran and that the race
whereon the pool was sold took place.
Wittman says many persons are selling
pools "on Eastern races, and he recom
mends the ordinance be so amended
that the prosecution will not be re
quired "to prove that the race took
place. Thjs could be done by prohibit
ing betting on races understood to be
run or purporting to be run between
horses.
The Police Commissioners also peti
tioned the board to re-enact section 34
of an old ordinance prohibiting the
shaking of dice for money in public
places. The Commissioners say there
Is great necessity for such an ordinance
because a large majority of the bunko
men in this city adopt the method of
shaking dice to fleece the unwary. The
petition was referred to the Judiciary
Committee.

Thus impelled, Schleslnger opened for
the defense. He read a formal "plea
of prior adjudication." This raised the
point that Judge Lacombe's decision in
the case of Benson, one of the four
alleged co-conspirators, holding that
the Indictment failed to show a crime
against the United States, must be
deemed binding on the courts of this
circuit until reversed by the Appellate
Court. Then Schlesinger read several
Federal decisions in support of this
contention. He concluded his argu
ment by calling attention to many of
the points made on the hearing before
Heacock and urged that to take Hyde
and Dimond 3000 miles away from
home for trial would be a hardship
not contemplated by the, statute and
a jrrave violation of their right*.
Knight then argued for more than
an hour, devoting himself mainly to
an attack upon the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of the District of Co
lumbia, in v.hieh the indictment was
found, and to pointing out defects in
the indictment itself. In opposition to
the Government's demand that the de
fendants bÂ« tried at Washington, he
District Attorney Woodworth set the
ball rolling when he made the appli
cation for the order of removal. Then
Judge de Haven let it be known that
he had no intention of doing Commis
sioner Heacock's work over again.
"Gentlemen," he said, "I shall give
to-day and to-day only to this hear
ing. Let each side take half the time
and divide its portion Â«mong the jat
torneys as you please. Proceed" at
once."
APPUES TOR REMOVAL.
For the defendant Hyde Attorneys
Garret McEnerney and Bert Schles
inger were there. For Dimond only
Samuel Knight appeared in court.
Charles S. Wheeler, who led in Dl
mond's defense during the first part
of the preliminary examination be
fore Heaccock, but was absent from
It after the now celebrated anonymous
letters became the turning point of
the Government case against his client,
failed to be present. Both Hyde and
Dimond were in court, Hyde sitting
with his counsel, Dimond lingering
timidly In the rear of the room.
Will the Federal Judres In San
Francisco consent to accept as the law
povernlnjr the Hyde-IMmond-Benson
land frauds case the decision recently
rendered by Judge E, Henry Lacombs
of the United States Circuit Court In
New York -when he discharged John
A- Benson from the Indictment, hold
ing that it failed to set forth a crime
against the United States? This Is the
question Involved In the series of legal
battles that opened yesterday, when
counsel for the Government an
nounced that Lacombe's decision
would be vigorously contested on ap
peal before the higher courts and
asked United States District* Judge de
Haven for an order removing Freder
ick A. Hyde and Henrv P. Dimond to
Washington for trial on* the indict
ment found by the Grand Jury of the
District of Columbia accusing them,
together with Benson and Joost H.
Schneider, of conspiring to defraud
the United States out of vast areas of
public lands.
Judge de Haven gave the entire day
to hearing: arguments for and against
the motion for removal and at their
conclusion reserved his decision. This
will probably not be announced for
several weeks, as his Honor will have
to consider not only the long briefs
filed by the lawyers, but also the gTeat
mass of testimony taken before Com
missioner Heacock in the preliminary
examination of Hyde and Dimond.
which lasted from March 23 to May
14 and resulted in their being held for
trial. Should he decide against the
defendants they will begin further
proceedings before Circuit Judge Mor
row to obtain their discharge on a
writ of habeas corpus.
The hearing brought to the bar
most of the distinguished lawyers who
battled together for nearly two
months before the Federal Commis-
Eioner. On the Government side were
present Francis J. Heney, special
counsel; Marshall B. Woodworth,
United States District Attorney in this
city, and Judge A. B. Pugh, one of the
attorneys of the Interior Department,
who has returned to San Francisco
frcm Washington to aid in opposing
the great fight which the Hyde-Di
mond attorneys will make to save their
clients from being tried at the Fed
eral capitaL
Mr. Heney closed the case for the
Government, following the same rea
soning as his associate, Judge Pugh.
It was his closing words, however, that
lent spice to his argument He said:
"Notwithstanding conscientious re
search, I have failed to find authority
to support the position taken here by
counsel for the defense that a decision
reached in a habeas corpus proceed
in?: in a case in which neither of the
defendants here at bar was a party
can be construed as supporting a plea
of 'res adjudicata.* If I understand
the law correctly I will say that even
had Mr. Benson been acquitted on
trial of the offense charged against
him, it would not stand as a bar
against the trial of these defendants.
"The judgment in the Benson case
Is not final. The Government has
taken an appeal from that decision
with full confidence that it will be
reversed. And I further believe thai
pres3 of business and unfamiliarity
Departing from this line of argu
ment. Judge Pugh turned to the ques
tion as to whether the contention of
the defense that the Government suf
fered no less is tenable. In the opin
ion of Judge Pugh the Government,
If it has not as yet suffered actual loss
through the alleged acts of the de
fendants, is liable to suffer such loss
in the future, for, he said, a title to
land held in the name of a fictitious
person is not a title and if in the fu
ture any action is brought against the
Government to recover the lands it ac
cepted from the defendants in lieu of
other lands taken by them It is hardly
possible that it could sustain a con
tention that as an innocent purchaser
it is entitled to protection in its hold-
Ing. It would be more probable that
the rule of '"caveat emotor"' would
prevail against it and the fictitious ti
tle would avail it not.
Garret McEnerney of Hyde's eoun
sel, who, by courtesy of counsel* for
the Government, was allowed a few
minutes of tb^ir time, contended tJiat
so far as the Government was con
cerned It had no established policy in
relation to the parceling out of public
lands and was not affected by the al
leged acts of the defendants. In view
of this fact even the contention of the
counsel for the Government that a
fraud against the administration of
the laws had been committed must
fall. In answer to the contention that
the titles passed by the defendants
when they selected lieu lands were not
titles upon which the Government
could even sustain a position of bona
fide innocent purchaser, McEnerney
said that if such were not in fact ti
tles then by no conceivable way could
the defendants be guilty of the fraud
with the commission of which they
stand charged.
DECISION IS QUESTIONED.
CONSIDERS THE FUTURE.
"The Government exists for the pro
tection and service of the people. This
being its chief aim, any action tend
ing to impair its functions in any way
certainly operates as a fraud against
it, a greater fraud than one involving
only financial loss to the Govern
ment."
Judge Pugh opened the argument at
the afternoon session, his points largely
constituting: an analysis of the princi
ple set forth In Judge Lacombe's de
cision that, as the Government suffered
no financial loss as a result of the al
leged criminal acts for which the de
fendants stand indicted, no fraud was
committed against the Government.
"It is not necessary that the Gov
ernment lose property or money in a
transaction that is fraudulent on Its
face to establish such fraud," he said.
"It Is sufficient that such frauds tend
in themselves to obstruct a just and
equitable administration of the laws.
The obstruction of the laws in any way
or the commission of any act that tenGs
to divert their proper administration.
If such acts are committed for that
purpose and for the advantage or gain
of the person committing such acts,
the fraud is as complete against the
Government as if it suffered actual
financial loss.
OI7ELIXES THE OFFEXSE.
said: "My client, Mr. Dlmond, now of
fers to submit himself to this court,
to await any action the Federal Grand
Jury of this district may take regard
ing: the charg-es against him." Knight
used up all the time allotted to the
defense, and tras stopped at last by
Judge de Haven, who ordered an ad
journment for recess.

Knights Templar from every part of the civilized
globe will soon be among us to accept our hospitality,
to transact their affairs of high moment and to judge
us in that scale of public opinion which has been formed
by civilizations older than our own. What these visitors
maythink of San Francisco means much to her, and her
citizens should leave undone nothing that may contribute
to a good impression!
Thefts of very large proportions are becoming a mat
ter of frequent and annoying occurrence at Newport,
and that celebrated colony of pleasure-seeking, work
shunning Americans is wondering what to do about it.
This should warn us, if it does not caution them, to be
very careful of the company, we keep. If any of the
stories that float from Newport be true theft there may
be included in the category of minor immoralities.
THE final report of the census of 1901 of the British
Empire has just been issued. Not merely to the
student of modern politics, who watches the prog
ress of nations and speculates upon the marvelous po
tentialities of colonization and national solidarity, nor to
the directing spirit of racial intercourse, but to the
statesmen of England this ' report, staggering in its ar
ray of facts and figures, presents problems of tremen
dous moment. ,
-Great Britain has grown until now she controls one
fifth of the area of the globe and includes in her domin
ion four hundred million people. How to preserve this
splendid empire, composed of innumerable races, inspired
by diverse traditions and impelled by antagonistic ideals,
may well be considered one 1 of the ; great problems of
statecraft. How to govern these peoples to a respect for
the mother country, which many of them never knew
and most of them do not understand, may well appall
the imagination of the most sanguine. How to impel

A SEQUENCEâ X-Â» Mill Valley. Cal.
A sequence la cribbage consists of
three or more cards following la suc
cessive number whether o* the sarns
suit or otherwise. He who holds teem
scores one point for every card in tha
combination, whether It takes place ia
playing or la counting the hand or
crib. But there cannot be a sequenca
under three cards. As In certain other
cases, the court cards, kiar. queen and
knave, rank in sequence, after their
urual classification as i.. rank and not
all alike as tenth cards. If ia the pJay
the cards come 7, S, 5 aad 6 the last
player Is entitled to a run â¢ ; four be
cause he can make a sequence, as co
cards Intervene. It does cot matter
of what suit the cards are provided
the sequence can be produced by a
transposition of the cards from thÂ«
order In which they were played. If a
sequence in play Is oace broken it must
be formed afresh or it cannot be acted
upon.
Several representative young Australians will soon
come to the United States to receive their education.
It is fitting, perhaps, that the youngest people of the
new world should seek here the instruction that will
best fit them for success in those fields that have made
the United States the criterion of manners and methods
m the acquisition of practical utilitarian civilization. We

way to force a surplus on the right side of the ledger.
Nevada is seeing things again. This time it seems to
be a new star flashing its fires into the blackness of the

those that wish her well. It is not unusual for people
to see any old thing in Nevada, but when they do the
accompaniment is generally a riot. Seeing stars is com
paratively a harmless diversion.

to the shaded tea tables c-f the officers'

WITH the institution of large irrigation systems
on the Pacific Coast originated cond:tions cer
tain to result in the disappearance of many
ajces ultimately. The water that has poured into the
la*ces has more valuable use when diverted by canal 3
from its original course and used to irrigate parched
lands. Attention was recently directed to an organized
movement in Kings County to keep the remnant of
currents that formerly fed Tulare Lake from running
into sheir ancient reservoir.
Bottom lands of the Tulare Lake are of great richness
and hundreds of thousands of surrounding acres need
to be irrigated. The old lake bed requires protection
against too much water; the adjoining lands need more
water. The doom of Tulare Lake is pronounced for all
time. '
News now comes from Inyo County that Owens Lake,
a remnant of a great inland sea. continues to shrink
continually. Noah Winkle, superintendent of soda works
situated at the lake, reports to the Inyo Register that
the water has fallen fifteen feet in ten years. The shore
line has receded 5000 feet in that time. For many years
there was no observable change in the size of the lake.
The water now rises slightly in the winter and early
spring, but the close of each rainy season finds it lower
than it was in the preceding year. The annual average
fall in the lake level in the last three years has been two
and a haif feet, which is greater than at any time pre
ceding of which record has been kept. Thirty vears
ago the lake had a depth of fifty-one feet of water in
its center. The maximum is now 36 feet In fifteen
years, at the present rate so estimates the Inyo Regis
ter. Owens Lake will have become only a memory-
The Great Salt Lake has lost its sources of supplv be
cause there are irrigable lands to be served. Evapo
ration is therefore diminishing its size quite rapidly.
With all this and what i; implied in several directions,
it is certain that lakes will not be unknown where there
are arid lands. The necessity for reservoirs of wide
extent for irrigation uses is obvious. Denser popula
tion wiil demand that ultimately every drop of moun
tain water that now runs to waste shall be stored.
Artificial lakes in the shape of carefully constructed and
permanent reservoirs will be numerous. The United
States Government, by the erection of the Tonto d2m,
will call into existence a lake that will be thirty-five
miles long. Lakes of considerable size for the irriga
tion of Nevada's and California's arid lands will ha\<e
been created before the present plans of the Government
culminate. All running streams in the Sierras will be
impounded. Lakes that will be navigable and large
enough to be bordered by quite large settlements, pos
sibly towns and cities, will exist. The new succeeds
the old. Of the two classes of lakes, the newer and
the older, the newer will be more useful to man.

His "adoration" . finished. Maryon
chanted a song about Immortality,
preached a sermon full of references
to "soul substance," "the wonder of
Amen Ra" and "the god behind the
Santir.g Â«e " and then proceeded to
tell about his coming tabernacle.
He said: "I will build a temple In
London dedicated to all the gods and
it shall be called the Pantheon, like
the ancient fabric of that name
at Rome. Within this edifice I
and my followers shall worship
all the beautiful gods and god
desses of mytholqzy." Then he
spoke of the London birds. 'They
were all human beings in their former
state," he ! declared. "You may be
pireons in your next state. Therefore
! It behooves us to respect all creatures.
"In the temple I am going to build
there will be a tower set apart for
! birds â pigeons, sea galls, crows, spar
! ro-Â»s, lost canaries, lost parrots."
How Mr. Maryon is going to get the
birds to come to his tower he did net
explain. It was assumed he is depend
ing on the -winged disk to manage this.
"Let me have $12,500 to start with."
he went on. "You can all join the
Pantheistic sect which I am forming
and I can safely guarantee you 5 per

I me." he pleaded Ingenuously.
The high priest of the winged disk
has a certain amount of personality
and evidently has made a great im

collected so far. His first public meet

were concerned â particularly the re
incarnation part of it.. The follow

sung, which were joined in quite
gravely:

States older than Ohio and California have long been
in the enjoyment of tax systems simple in their mechan
ism, cheap in their administration and equal in their
burdens, and States less fortunate should not hesitate to
take advantage of their experience. The committee of
the State Grange says: ''California's system of taxation
needs a general revision and the people of the State are
awakening to a realization of it. This is being under
stood by all who give thought *o the subject, as is the
fact that our own experience and that of other States
will now enable us to formulate a system of taxation that
will be as nearly equitable and just as taxation can be,
and that will also be a guide for other States to follow.
The possession of property is notjthe sole test of ability
to pay taxes. Incomes not derived from property that
is taxed should be required to contribute to the support
of government. Taxes as levied and collected in Cali
fornia are. theoretically, equal according to the money
value of real and personal property. But in actual prac
tice real property pays nine-tenths and personal one
tenth, although it is well understood that the money
value and earning power of personalty is double that of
realty. Some say that as realty now pays nine-tenths of
the tax, put on it the other tenth and simplify the sys
tem. We have no patience, sympathy or tolerance for
this proposition. It would only be adding another great
wrong to the one now perpetrated."
It is an interesting fact that , these statements, made
by authority of the State Grange, disclose the same con
ditions here as those complained of in Ohio, where a
reform organization hss charge of the matter. The own
ers of country realty seem to be awakening to the situa
tion. The issue they make is one that touches their in
terests closest, and they have.it in their power to force
it to a foremost place for action.
California will watch with interest the progress made
in Ohio, and the two States may well lead the way to a
general revision of State laws and constitutions on this
great and interesting economic subject.
â¢â > ALIFORNIA is not the only State in which tax
I reform promises to become a burning issue. Here
J it is plain to many investigators and experts that
our general property tax, by what appear to be the neces
sary infirmities of its administration, does not bear
equally cpon all forms of property and allot to each its
proper share in the support of the government. To rem
edy this it is proposed that corporations shall be made
subject to State tax only, in the expectation that such a
system will "supply most of the revenue needed for sup
port of the State government- The remainder may be
secured by a State excise on liquor and tobacco, in the
form of a State license, which shall be in lieu of local
license on such business.
This subject, taken up forcibly by the State Grange,
wiil remain in focus as a public issue until some form of
adjustment is reached. It is a serious and grave mat
ter, deserving the profound attention of our legislators.
Some months ago Governor Pardee indicated his pur
pose to suggest this reform in his next message, and if he
do this the whole question will be officially brought to the
attention of the next Legislature. Meantime it is ex
pected that the committee of the State Grange which
has it in charge for that organization will keep it before
the people and fix upon it the attention of candidates for
the Legislature.
The tax system of the State of Ohio is much older than
ours, but seems to be no better. The agitation for its
reform began before the same sort of movement, ap
peared here. The tax reformers of Ohio encounter much
opposition, while enjoying the support of the general ad
mission that the existing system is grossly defective and
unequal. But conservatism is the same everywhere when
it degenerates into inertia. The Ohio method, with all
its glaring imperfections, has been so long in operation
that many citizens of that State say that, bad as it is, the
people are accustomed to it and have adjusted their ways
and affairs to its administration, and that any change
would compel them to readapt themselves, and therefore
it is better to let bad enough alone.
The Legislature has made several attempts at reform,
bat the indifference or the conservatism of the people
have defeated them all, until the tax reformers have been
driven to an active and aggressive campaign of educa
tion. Declaring that taxation is the legal confiscation of
property, they are rousing public sentiment to a study
of such confiscation, to the end that the State shall take
from each citizen and every form of property only a just
share of what the State must have to pay it for the equal
protection of ail men and all kinds of property. Â¦ In that
State this subject promises to displace all others in local
politics, and to make a new cleavage that will endure un
til a settlement is reached. Popular government is ex
pensive government, because it does more and better
than other forras of governments. The administration
of justice a the courts of this country is very costly, be
cause our judicial tribunals have in their care and keep
ing all of the rights of person and property.
In an autocracy courts are not needed, for all persons
and property are in executive hands and their rights
have no judicial protection at all. For this and other
kindred reasons popular government is costly, but the
money that it costs is all devoted to its necessary pur
poses. The study cf such government must be to econo
mize expenditures, equalize the burdens of taxation and
make the administration of a tax system as simple and
economical as possible.

Now when Great Britain dazzles the world with an
empire of twelve million square miles and more than
four hundred millions of people the fear is not one of
weakness in relation to others, but of a crumbling and
disintegration from within. Some idea of the gravity of
this fear may be obtained when we realize that of the
empire there are four million square miles in North, Cen
tra! and South America, three million square miles in
Australasia, three million square miles in Africa, more
than one and three-quarter million square miles in Asia
and only 125.095 square miles in the United Kingdom.
Where the consent of the governed and not the com
mand of the King dictates the progress of the empire
the serious duty of English statesmen cannot be
underestimated nor their difficulties misunderstood.
A few pertinent facts in the census report jast
issued will show the character of these duties and
dificulties in the marvelous development of the
empire almost the period of a generation. In
'.861 the population of the British Empire was one hun
dred and seventy-five millions; in 1871 it was two hun
dred and thirty-five millions; in 1SS1 it was three hun
dred and ten millions; in 1891 it was three hundred and
fiity-one millions. With more than this vast horde
01 many races and varied civilizations London must deal
carefully, diplomatically and triumphantly.
obedience to measures in which the preponderating weight
of the empire has no vital interest and how to enlist
sepport in campaigns in which it has no selfish concern
are tasks that may well win the admiration of nations
less unwieldy and more compact.
When England first dared to suggest, one hundred and
fifry years ago, the idea of a census of the British Em
pire the proposal met with a storm of parliamentary pro
test, based upon a fear of conditions far different and
infinitely less serious than those that now face the em
pire. .The scheme of an imperial census was denounced
as presumptuous, as subversive of liberty, as a weapon
to inspire new governmental rapacity, oppression, taxa
tion and increased conscription. Further than this, the
plan was condemned as a foolish measure, which would
expose to other nations the weakness of the British Em
pire.

In fact "For Her Children's Sake" is
hardly a comedy of manners. For per
sons brought up under the ecclesias
tical wing they are In fact singularly
free. Edna embraces the family but
ler (who seems to have dropped In
from an Irish team at the Orpheum)
at the smallest provocation. She
chokes her lydy friend In the rudest
fashion. It is true the lydy friend has
been chaffing her- about earning her
dally chep by circus-ridingâ the proud
rector's daughter. Still, Edna does
warn her afterward: "Out of my sight
before I forget myself."
For she has become a circus rider for
her children's sake. She didn't marry
the doctor. She married another. The
doctor was reported dead, but is called
in to treat his old love.
He says that reports of his death
were much exaggerated. The ringmas
ter Edna has married F. H. C. S.
discovers them and is jealous. The
lady is brought behind scenes from the
arena with "four hours to live" and
a pint of gore dripping from her left
cheek. The ringmaster swears ven
geance on her for killing "his best
horse." Then the boy takes a pot shot
at him. Hits. Thunders of applause.
The most remarkable person in thu
cast is George Nlcholls. stage manager.
One has held Henry Miller before as
the head and front of this side of stage
craft. But there are yet things for
Mr. Miller to learn. Even David Be

achieved the surpassing realism of Mr.
Nlcholls 1 boudoir scene. There is, In
fact, nothing left to the Imagination.
Which is about as much as should be
seen of Mr. Nicholls round the Cen

frank detail is retained.

GEORGIE O'RAMET. POPULAR
SOUBRETTE. WHO RETURNS TO
FISCHEIT9 PLAYHOUEE.
After having been divorced from j
Clara Muller on the ground of her cm- j
elty and then coming to the conclusion j
that she was insane and not responsi
ble for her acts, Frederick V. Muller j
asks the court to set aside Its decree j
and announces his purpose to remain j
the husband of a woman who is now in
the insane asylum at Agnew.
Muller filed his suit for divorce on
March 14. He charged that his wife I
had abused him, had accused him of â¢
violating his marriage vows and, as a
climax to many assaults, had narrowly |
missed his head with a heavy steel
hammer. She did not reply to the suit,
and on April 5 he was granted an in
terlocutory decree, which was entered
on April 8. After the entry Mrs. Muller
was arrested for insanity and commit
ted to the Agnew asylum, where she is
still detained. Muller says her conduct
and the opinion of physicians make him
believe that she was irresponsible dur
ing the years of her extreme cruelty
to him, and as he "still has respect,
love and affection for her, excuses her
past misconduct," and "for further car
rying out his marital nromise to love,
cherish and protect her for the balance
of her life," he asks the court to set
aside its decree of divorce.
Isaac Selby, the Australian minister,
who conducted his own defense before
Judge Hebbard in the suit of his wife,
Theresa, for divorce and lost it, was
yesterday turned down again by the
same Judge, who denied the motion to
set the decree aside. Selby's affidavit
accompanying the motion was sensa
tional in many respects, and among
other things said that his friends "in
Australia would consider the decree an
immoral verdict given by a discredited
American court."
Judge Hunt yesterday denied the suit
ol Dina Smith, who sought separation
from Andrew Smith for failing to pro
j vide for and properly live with her. The
j woman said she would not go back to
', him, so the court ordered Smith to pay
j lior $10 a month for the care of their
; baby.
i Suits for divorce were begun by
i Frankie A. Holzhauser against Rudolph
â¢ for neslect and desertion. Albert E.
Wallen against Augusta for habitual
intemperance, Frank T. Rams,ey against
. Maud for cruelty, Annie Fay against
Robert for neglect and cruelty and
Viola F. Craven against W. L. Craven
for cruelty. In the last case the hus
band is said to have blackened his
, wife's eye and knocked her mother
down for interfering with his pugilistic
propensities. Mary M. Quinn sued Wil
liam J. Quinn, a tailor, for divorce on
, the ground of cruelty. He had her ar
â¢ rested once for insanity.
j , Judge Kerrigan granted a divorce to
'p. C. "F. Gleason from Amelia on the
ground of desertion. In the case of Con
; nolly against Connolly, Judge Troutt
i granted a divorce to the wife, who
i charged cruelty.

The eminent Bible teacher, Rev. Wil
liam R. Newell of the Moody Institute.
Chicago, addressed a large body of
ministers of various denominations
yesterday in the lecture room of the
Y. M. C. A. There is a strong effort
being put forward to induce Rev. New
ell to remain several weeks in the city
to form popular Bible classes.
Speaking of the work cf the com
mittee for the suppression of the dis
tribution of vicious literature and pic
tures in the city. Rev. F. A. Keast said
yesterday that while they had not been
able to find any official connected with
the Society for the Suppression of Vice,
though a search had been made by
Rev John A. B. Wilson, the minis
terial committee is, nevertheless, full
of action and fight and would follow
out its programme in the interest of
the morals of the youth of San Fran
cisco. ' "
Twenty-six missionaries will sail on
Thursday. August 18, on the Doric, be
ing distributed between Japan. China,
Siam and other Oriental points. A re
ception will be tendered the mission
aries to-morrow evening at the First
Presbyterian Church, Van Ness ave
nue, corner of Sacramento street.
The outgoing missionaries are:
HEAR EMINENT TEACHER.
The growth of the. Institutional
Church, he explained, is a marvel. It
tends to the upbuilding of life â to a
more clean living and improved ethical
conditions. As an instance he described
the Whitefield Chapel. Tottenham
Court Road. London, where he said
there is now being erected a plant in
connection with the chapel, where will
be found recreation rooms, a restau
rant, reading rooms, baths, bedroomsâ
*'all resulting in a thorough blending of
the house of God with the boarding
house."
The immediate tendency, he found,
in the British Isles was the helping
for "the new" and a less ardent care
for "the future."
Congregational headquarters were
filled yesterday when the ministers of
that denomination met to hear Rev. J.
J. Staub of Oregon deliver an ad
dress.
Among other things the speaker
pointed out that the State from which
he hails Is not suffering from the "dis
ease of central church." which U ap
peared to him had badly afflicted this
city and Oakland especially* Rev.
Staub said also that the Congrega
tional College of his State had set the
standard for study in Oregon.
In speaking of the difficulties encoun
tered by the clergy of San Francisco.
Rev E. R. Willis. D. D.. said at the
meeting of the Methodist Ministers'
Association, held yesterday in Epworth
Hall, that St. Paul's gospel of Christ
iÂ«s the only means to keep the work
going in the city. To accept the condi
tions with which St. Paul surrounded
himself is the only way, the doctor
suggested, in which a minister f-an
work In San Francisco without dis
couragement.
There was a time in the old world
"when they feared hell," but in these
days the speaker found' that "the very
devil has gone out of the category,"
and that loss of fear has led many
to do exactly what they please.
He then traveled upon the road
whereon he found better conditions in
the British Isles and one of the all
important good things that exists there
is the Institutional Church. In this
direction he has discovered that among
the earnest Christian people there is
actually a "clipping off of devotion,"
and the course followed is toward the
material as well as spiritual benefiting
of less fortunate humanity.
LOOK TO MATERIAL SIDE.
Rev. Ferguson found that the work
ing people are drifting from their old
moorings. In Scotland he discovered
that there is a tendency to give them
selves up to drink to an appalling de
gree.
Many things have puzzled the Rev.
John Ferguson of Sc Stephen's Pres
byterian Church, Sydney, New South
Wales, during his travel around the
world. That much the noted"'Austra
lian divine . admitted yesterday morn
ing in his talk to the members of the
Presbyterian Ministers' Association.
He said that it is clearly evident
that many Christian people are mov
ing on in their course toward heaven
without professing any rational basis
for their faith. For instance, when
asked some question they have no bet
ter answer than. "I know it is a good
thing for me to balieve."
In the universities, the reverend
speaker said, they are not looking for
the fundamentals and are fighting shy
of the scriptures and the questions
that are authoritatively given.
In the British Isles he found that
the evangelistic movement is taking a
great hold and to be able to speak in
the open air is one of the qualifica
tions of a minister.

A fight occurred last evening about
8 o'clock In front of the Kingston
House, 215 O'Farrell street, between
Frank Roscettl, a driver for the
United Carriage Company, and a par^y
of sympathizers of the striking hack
men. Roscetti was hit on the head,
his scalp lacerated with a slungshot,
hir. carriage was damaged and his
harness was cut to pieces.
The trouble began by some person
sending a call from 316 O'Farrell
street for Roscetti and his, carriage.
When he arrived at that place he
could not learn who wanted him.-. He
accused a number -. of men in the
neighborhood of decoying him there
and the fight soon began. Missiles
were thrown at the driver and : sev
eral large; windows' in- the houses. near,
and the glass in the .carriage .were
broken.: During the' fight the harness
on Roscetti's horses was cut, thbugn
he patched it up sufficiently to drive
home.
A meeting of carriage drivers was
held " later at 310 O'Farrell , street v for
the : purpose . of learning who sent ; the
call that decoyed Roscetti to the place.
No arrests were made.

SARATOGA, Aug. 15.â Saratoga is
agog to-night with stories of immense
losses of money by men who have been
induced to gamble in a private room
In one of the big hotels. Professional
gamblers have made their headquarters
in Saratoga for many seasons, and it is
as impossible to keep them out of the
hotels here as It is to prevent them tak
ing passage on the 'great ocean liners.
Poker games in Saratoga hotels are as
likely to be started by shortcard men
aB are games on the trans-Atlantic
ships, and the victims are'less likely to
come forward with complaints.
Within the last few days the proprie?
tors of several gambling-house3 here
have learned with surprise that several
of their regular patrons have lost large
sums in a roulette game in one of the
hotels, where many leading families are
quartered for the season. . "While it was
known that professional poker could
not be suppressed, the gamblers were
surprised that nny of their confreres
could run a wheel, with the incidental
noise, within the limits of a big hotel.
According to stories circulating on
the piazza of the hotel the losses of
some of the players have run far into
the thousands.

WIX GAME FOR BROOKLYX
YORK. Aug. 16.â Between WO
and S00 raen employed by the George
A. Puller Construction Company to-day
joined the ranks of the striking building
I trad* workers. There are now about
SO.000 men oat of work. Including skilled
rn < K^T?"tÂ°# and laborers, as the result
â¢of the .present difficulty.
There are about G0.0000 skilled work
men In the building trades In this city
who -would be affected by a general
ctzOca or lockout. In addition to these.
It la estimated that 45,000 helpers and
laborers and 15,000 employes of xnate
rtalznen would be thrown out of work,
rrxVrng- a total of 120.000. Their loss
in wages would amount in round fig
ures to $10,000,000 a month, in addition
to which the capital of the 1000 mem
bers of the Building Trades Employers'
Association and the millions of dollars
invested in property undergoing Im
provement would be tied up.
The employes declare they are deter
mined that the arbitration agreement
adopted a year ago shall be respected,
with the open shop policy as the alter
native.
At a meeting of the Building Trades
Alliance to-day the Elevator and Mill
workers* Union was suspended because
of. Its action in returning to -work on
the Trinity building after the alliance
had ordered a strike. The Carpenters'
Union to-day made arrangements for
the raising of at least $20,000 a week
as a strike fund.
R. J. Anslow, business agent of the
Btoae Cutters' Union, eaid within a
â¢ week the stone cutters undoubtedly
would strike on at least a dozen or
more buildings.
Kfd McCoy has become a fixture to
Munroe's training staff, and from now
on he will drill the miner through the
finer points In foxing. He boxed three
rounds with the miner yesterday after
noon at the beach training quarters.
They went to it very lightly, but before
many days the pace will increase. -
The crowd that wanted to see the
big fellow train was more than could
be handled and a number of them were
refused admittance. About two hun
dred secured admittance to see Munroe
go through his various training stunts.
In the morning he traveled eight
miles on the road with his sparring
partner, Chester, and on his 'return he
punched the bag for half a dozen
rounds.
He opened the afternoon session with
a two-round bout with Chester. Gal
lagher followed next. He was In
structed to make a fast pace, so as to
give McCoy an idea of what he could
do. They went at it in great style,
which impressed McCoy and the audi
ence.
McCoy then took the miner in hand
and showed him the different ways to
deliver certain blows and how he could
improve his footwork. They â¢ then
donned the gloves and boxed cleverly
for three rounds.
McCoy was much impressed with
Munroe. He said the big fellow has
improved wonderfully since his bout
with Sharkey and that Jeffries will
have to exert himself in' the coming
battle.
Tim McGrath will continue to map
out the work for the miner and he
will supervise the condition part of
the work. McCoy will devote himself
exclusively In helping the challenger
to improve his boxing and attain as
much speed as he possibly can for his
battle.
Munroe has a protege whom he calls
the "Saginaw Kid." He says this lit
tle fellow is a comer, and has secured
him a preliminary to the big fight.

JEFFRIES BEGINS TO BOX.
Champion Does Six Rounds and From
Xow on Will Work Inside.
HARBIN SPRINGS, Aug. 15.âJef
fries did his first boxing yesterday. In
the afternoon he went through six
rounds, dividing the work between his
brother Jack and Joe Kennedy. The
three rounds he sparred with Brother
Jack were hummers and everybody in
the camp was elated at the showing
of the champion. They are satisfied
that he is in prime shape and nothing
can hinder the present match, from
taking place on the date selected.
The gymnasium will be the place
from now on. Hunting and long runs
on the road 'will be cut out. Jeffries
will devote himself to acquiring speed.
Jeff was up at 5 o'clock and trav
eled twelve miles on the road. He had
breakfast on his return and then went
to the "gym." Everything was in
readiness for a strenuous day's work.
He pulled on the wrist machines for
a while and then went to the spring
bag. This is his favorite exercise and
he tugged at the bag "unceasingly.
When he finished he appeared to be
as fresh as a daisy.
In his bout with Kennedy he had
to spare his partner, who is suffering
with a sore ear, but nevertheless Joe
gave him some excellent foot work.
Jeff has taken to sprinting and he is
the center of attraction when he does
his 100-yard dashes.
RATHER THAN BE CALLED
TRAITOR HE EXDS LIFE
â¢JriÂ«h Soldier or Fortune, Who Fought
for the Boers. Commits Suicide
In Brooklyn.
NEW YORK. Aug. 15. â Brooding
â¢ over undeserved disgrace due to
treachery during the South African
Â¦war, James Curran. a silversmith and
a veteran of the South African war,
formerly with the Boer army, to-day
committed suicide in his Brooklyn
lodgings. ; ; V : â¢
Curran was a native of Ireland.
When the war between Great Britain
and the Boers broke out he was at
â¢ m ork in the Kimberley mines. He
had saved a small competence, and,
contributing this to the Boer cause,
raised a company of scouts, of which
he became captain. This company
was successful for a time, but in a
skirmish before Ladysmith the whole
company was destroyed, all of the
members being either killed or cap
tured by the British.
Captain Curran was made a
prisoner, but within a week he escaped
" end returned to the Boer army. There
he was accused of having led his men
into a trap. He was found guilty and
was sentenced to be shot, but escaped
two days before the proposed execu
tion. Making his way to Cape Town,
he took a ship for America and se
cured employment.
A few weeks ago Curran gave away
hi3 sword, remarking to a friend that
he could not bear the sight of it
. longer, as it continually reminded him
. cf undeserved disgrace.

Remembering that cleanliness is next
to godliness. Health Officer Dr. D. F.
Ragan and Chief Inspector TV*. C
Hassler put in last Sunday visit-
Ins the Santa Clara dairies that
supply milk to San Francisco. The
sanitary condition of the establish
ments, of the cows and the pastures
were closely observed to seo if the reg
ulations of tha San Francisco Board
of Health, enacted Into an ordinance
by the Supervisors, were being fol
lowed. If such rules are not complied
with in every Instance it is the inten
tion of the board to Quarantine the
milk coming from places found un
healthfuL Althoueh most of the dai
ries -were found to be in good condi
tion, there were others that fell under
the disapproval of the official visitors
and alterations were ordered.
The Acrenla Dairy, situated about
two miles north of the city of Santa
Clara, was visited and found to be In
a satisfactory condition, except in th*v
matter of the sanitary state of tbÂ»
barn, which can be greatly improved.
The proprietor promised to comply
with the specific regulations submitted
by the San Francisco health officers.
The ventilation of the buildings is
good, but the milk room and shed need
more general cleanliness.
The new dairy of James Rea, two
miles west of the Aprenia place, was
found to be In a very satisfactory con
dition. Here cement flooring in the
milk shed, louvre ventilation and wa
ter under pressure, so that floors and
walls can be flushed dally.
Health Officer Ragan next visited ths
Cottle Dairyy' which sells milk in San
Francisco. The conditions of the es
tablishment were found to be satisfac
tory, except that the milk room is
closer to the milk shed than tha
requlremtnts of the Board of Health
allow and the construction of the
can room is not In accordance with
the rules of the board. At the expira
tion of the present lease, which "will be
In three months, the dairy will be re
moved to another ranch, where the
new buildings will be made more sat
isfactory.
The dairy of M. Osier was found in a
bad sanitary condition. On the 130
acres of ground there are pastured 165
cows. No milk is being shipped from
this place to San Francisco at present.
so the visiting board concluded not to
submit an elaborate report of the many
deficiencies of the Ojrier dairy. Tha
milk from this stablishmnt would not
be admitted to this city.

8ARATOOA. N. T., Aug. 15.â The
inglorious defeat of the once famous
McChesney in the sixth race to-day
was the event of the afternoon. His
trainer, Frank Taylor, has chosen
what every one said was an easy spot
for the reappearance of the noted
chestnut, "but among: those entered was
John A. Drake's Jocund and from this
dangerous stable it was feared Mc-
Chesney had found his conqueror and
was destined to be beaten. Not only
did Joound defeat* him, but also Dim
ple and the maiden Aurumaster fin
ished in front of him. The race was
run in 1:39 1-5, not first rate, or even
second rate, when the fast track and
the ideal weather conditions are taken
into account. Any selling plater of
fair class can run a mile better than
1:40 over the Saratoga course. *
Almost from the start, those who
saw McChesney running in a laborious
manner feared that he would not do.
As they neared the turn into the
stretch the noted racer showed a flash
of his old form, but just as he was
making his run Aurumaster, on his
right, and Dimple, just in front of him.
formed a pocket. Fuller's right hand
was at work and he used his whip on
the chestnut's glossy flanks, but the
response was not, that of old. and the
four horses ran past the judges with
Jocund two lengths in front of Dim
ple and she in advance of Aurumaster,
while McChesney was a length behind
the third horse. Summary:

BABY MEXICAN TIGER
IS YOUNG ROACH'S PET
Son of Famous Shipbuilder Captures
Animal in the AViltls of South
ern Republic.
Among the guests at the Palace is
William M. Roach, son of the famous
shipbuilder, John B. Roach, of Ches
ter, Pa. The young man and Ar
turo del Toro of Chapala, Mexico, ar
rived here Sunday from the southern
republic, where, near the city of Aca
pulco, a New York company in which
they are interested and of which Del
Toro is the president is preparing to
develop a million acres of land, which
is said to be admirably adapted for
the growing of cotton.
The presence of the two men at the
Palace Hotel yesterday attracted the
attentfon of many owing to the fact
that young Roach was accompanied
by a baby Mexican tiger, which he
captured near Chapala and of which
he is trying to make a pet.
The company which he and Del
Toro represent is backed wholly by
American capital and will be the fir3t
to undertake on a large scale the
growing of cotton in Mexico. Upon
this subject Del Toro said yesterday:
Mexico Is now Importing cotton to the extent
of between five and six millions of dollars an
nually. Naturally an enterprise such a*
the one our company la inaugurating la re
ceiving every possible encouragement front
the Mexican Government, from whiÂ»-h w* hf.o
obtained special concessions. After several
months' inspection w e found a tract of land
back Â£f the city of Acapulco wTiich expert.*
have, declared is excelled in no other part of
the 'West as a field for cotton growing. Aw
yet our project has simply reached the end of
the preliminary stage, where we have acquired
our land and necessary capital for establishing
a promising Industry In that republic.
Del Toro has lived in Mexico for a
number of years and owns one of the
most, luxurious homes on the lake side
of Chapala.

Xo little difficulty will be experi
enced in placing the thermometer on
the mountain top owing to its inac-
c cesibility. However, a party will un
c^rtake the work and a visit to the in
strument will be made every thre<*
months to record the thermometer's
registration.
â¢ Arrangements have been made at
the weather bureau for the placing of
e. minimum temperature thermometer
on Mount Whitney at an altitude of
14.515 feet above the sea level. This
-will be the highest point in the Unit
ed St2tes where an instrument for the
recording of temperature will be
placed. f Â¦' V
The thermometer is arranged so
that the indicator will register the
lowest temperature of the coldest day.

in the Instrument rises under the in
floence of succeeding higher tempera

sometimes occurs. The heights given are In
addition to the soundings of the United States
Coast Survey Chirts. except when a minus ( )
sign precedes the heipht. and then the number
{riven is subtracted from the depth given by
the charts. The plane of reference Is the mean
of the lower low waters.
He then gave a detailed description
of Lake Merced and its surroundings,
saying that the company has from
time to time been buying in surround
ing ranches In order to preserve the
water from pollution. Further than
this certain tributary streams had
been diverted and are emptying into
the ocean, as it was feared they would
carry filth into the lake. At present
the lake is kept but half full, as ex
perience has shown that it contains a
number of springs and when the water
is at a low level it is freer from im
purities than when the lake is full.
As an emergency supply, Engineer
Schussler is of the opinion that there
is none better than this great lake, sit
uated within the city limits and within
five or six miles of the center of popu
lation. When the plans now under
way are completed the storage capa
city of Lake Merced will have been so
increased as to furnish a seventy-day
supply of water to the city in case all
other sources should fail. "It's stor
age facilities, in fact," he said, "are as
great as those of a flowing well."
In support of this Schussler quoted
extracts from, a report made to the
Supervisors by former City Engineer
Grunsky in 1902 in which he said:
"Lake Merced is more favorably lo
cated than Lobos Creek. It can safely
be used to safeguard the supply from
other sources. â¢ â¢ â¢ The best supplies
near at hand are Crystal Springs and
Lake Merced, the latter only for emer
gency uses."
The project' of utilizing the coast
streams on the peninsula, the witness
said, is only feasible by developing
the Crystal Springs property, which,
with the Alameda Creek system, will
furnish a supply of 140,000,000 gallons
a day or 30,000,000 more than is esti
mated the city will need fifty years
hence.
The description of the properties of
the Spring Valley Water Works was
continued yesterday before Commis
sioner Heacock by Engineer Schussler,
testifying for the corporation in its suit
against the city to have Bet aside the
water rate arbitrarily fixed by the Su
pervisors.
The greater portion of the day was
occupied in an exhaustive description
of Lake Merced, the quantity and
quality of the water it contains and
the territory from which it draws Its
supnly. A comparison was also made
of the relative expense of bringing
water Into the city through pipe lines
by gravity pressure alone and raising
it to certain levels b-" artificial means.
Engineer. Sehussler said that while
some years ago the gravity system was
the most economical the invention of
improved pumping machinery has so
completely altered conditions that a
short-line service with powerful pumps
is far safer and more economical. A
long pipe line is not only expensive to
construct but is also subject to breaks
which not only cause a waste of water,
but cut off the supply. In case of a
conflagration such an accident would
be disastrous.

According to the reports on file, tho
improvements on real property in tha
entire county for the year amount to
$3 4.523,280, an increase of $2,126,750 over
last year. One item showed a decrease
of more than $1,500,000 in improvements
to property outside the incorporated
cities and towns. Assessor Dalton said
evidently a mistake had occurred in
placing Items under their proper head
ings, as no such decrease had been
made in outside property.
He claimed that this amount, added
to the actual increase of $1,134,242.
would give practically a total increasa
of $3,573,242. with $105,000. the assess
ment on ferry-boats plying between
Alameda and San Francisco, which
was not included in his report, would
give an increase of $3,584,242.
Equalizer Frank ilaitlson contended
that the Auditor's figures, which ara
as yet unofficial, do not bear out Dalâ
ton's contention. He claimed that
while there is an apparent difference of
$870,928 in the reports of the Assessor
and the Auditor, the latter had taken
no account of the $2,443,000 valuation
of the Contra Costa Water Company's
franchise, which the Assessor had left
off.
The total valuation of real property
and improvements is given at JIO'^,210,
403 this year, against $107,106,161 for
last year..
The Auditor's returns, after tho
County Board of Equalization finished
its sitting, showed a tota* of $106.3S3,
509, against $105,874,881 for last year.
In explaining his figures Dalton said
he had omitted 52.145,000 from the as
sessment of the Contra Costa Water
Company's franchise and water in res
ervoirs, because litigation is pending
which may result in these assets being:
lost to Alameda County for purposes of
assessment.
SACRAMENTO. Aug. 13.âRepresen
tatives of Alameda County were before
tha State Board of Equalization this
afternoon In response to a citation to
show cause why the assessment of that
county should not be raised. Those ap
pearing to speak in defense of the as
sessment as returned by the County
Auditor were Assessor H. P. Dalton,
Thornas M. Robinson, Chief Deputy-
Assessor; John Mitchell, chairman of
the Alameda Board of Supervisors; A.
G. Clark, Deputy Assessor; Supervisor
C. F. Homer, and H. C. Dexter, Deputy
Assessor. Â»
The State Board feels that Dalton
has not increased his assessments suf
ficiently. Dalton's figures show an in
lncrease of $1,134,242 over last year,
which is about 10 per cent, as against
an increase made by the board of Ji
per cent.

NEW YORK, Aug. 15. â The creeping move
ment of prices which was the characteristic
of last week's stock market developed into a
strong ar.<i comprehensive upward movement
to-day. The volume of transactions rose above |
the previous total of any day during the pres
ent movement. The market was broad and
the strength and activity were well distributed.
practically all divisions of the market sharing j
In the advance. There was much selling to |
take profits during the day and constant re
actions In consequence, but the manner of
digesting' this profit-taking wes more con
vincing" as to thf htalth of the market than
the upward rush of prices Itself, which has
been under suspicion of manipulation and due
tc the skillful tactics cf professional operators.
This F'uÂ£i>l<"ion has bÂ«en effective in keeping j
the general public out of the trading In thÂ» |
dread that the professional operations would j
prove Impossible of successful completion and
would lead to collapse when the pericd to
take rrofits arrived. There was no important
development In the news to-day cr since the
cloee cf the market last week, but the early
tone gave convincing evidence of something
like a crystallization of confidence in the
future of the market. Outside orders through
commission houses accumulated over Sunday
were larger than heretofore. London was also
a buyer here to an Important extent. London
was reported in more confident mood over Its
money outlook. Capital was said to draw
an augury of a hastened peac>Â» in the Far
East as a consequence of the serious reverses
to the Russian navaj force. The basis of the
growth cf confidence here was quite clearly
the faith that the country is to enjoy pros
perous conditions. The corn and cotton crops
showed the rreatest effects from this faith,
but St. Paul ss a wheat carrier with a large
shipping traffic In wheat was not included.
Tt.e question of the amount of whÂ«-at damage
was admitted to be undetermined as yet, but
the high price promised for the crop was
offered as providing an offset for the short
ness cf the crop. The most conspicuous feat
ure cf the market, however, was its diversion
into the new field of the trunk lines and coal
carriers. Tb^se groups have been compara
tively neglected while the crops have been
of dominant interest. Good prospects in the
steel- trade have held Pennsylvania at times.
but the movement of these stocks to-day
seemed more to be based on assumption of
the good to come from the crops to the whole
country. United States Steel preferred was
the con.Â«plcuous laggard in the day'* move
ment- This was presumably due to the cur
rer.t rumors of a purpose to cut prices in
flrlshed products, with hostile Intent toward
the independent companies, which, had a bad
effect on the market. Southern Pacific was also
under constant pressure to take profits and
rrade Its highest price on the running quota
tions at the opening. The Metropolitan trao
tlon 8 were feverish and Irregular throughout
the day In rplte of the violent advance of
Ir.terrwrourh Transit Â©n the curb. The un
settling influence of these exceptions to the
day's strength rained force and the amount
of iMÂ»Iline CM profits also dlm,lnis**d the dis
position of the professionals to support the
market. This made the closing easy at reduc
tions running to a point for the active stocks
from the high prices of the day.
Bonds were Irregular. Total sales, $4,773,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

WHEATâ Liverpool futures were higher.
The world's shipments for the week were aÂ«
follows, in quarters: Russian, 247,000; Ar
gentine, 211,000; Indian, 149,000; Australian,
26.0C0.
Chicago was still erratic and fluctuating, as
will be seen. Bad reports 'weTe still received
from the Xcrthwest.
The Chicago wires of R. Brent Mitchell said:
"The tone Is very unsettled and nervous, but
to-day It Is a strong market. Crop advices
from the Xorthwest are of the same general
conflicting and confusing character. Snow's
report from the Red River Valley was quite
bullish. Some of the other crop experts in
the Xorthwest Â»Â¦ also sent bullish reports. On
the other hand, there is considerable modifica
tion from sections of previous damage reports
and a great many from sections where the
wheat is good. The strength in corn was no
doubt a factor. The small increase in the visi
ble supply was also an Influence. We think It
should be kept In mind, however. In consider
ing the latter, that the present demand for the
recent large movement which has come from
the elevator people and the grat bulk of the
accumulation has no doubt gone into private
houses and does not show In the visible sup
ply. Cash markets were a little firmer and
i good grades of wheat are still at some pre-
I rr.lum. This Is easily accounted for by the
j fact that, haying been bought by elevator peo
ple and hedged, they are only disposed to let
j go of, It where they can. get a premium. We
think It reasonable to expect a free move
Â¦ ment at these prices. While we recognize
i the fact that the world's situation Is this year
j bullish on wheat and that our own domestic
situation contributes to this, yet we rather
feel that with the free present and prospective
movement and at current prices conservatism
In buying is wise."
In thts market futures were higher, with
heavy trading around $1 45. The cash grain

The Eastern markets are strengthening, as
will be seen by the following Chicago wires |
to R. Brent Mitchell yesterday: "Strength j
is largely In sympathy with the advance in i
corn. There is no weather to hurt oats and 1
Terr few complaints of damage except by i
rust in the Xorthwest. The movement is lib- j
eral. There is a good deal of speculative buy- |
Ing, however, on the theory of relative cheap

CORX â Dullness still characterizes the mar- j
ket and quotations are unchanged. Western
crop reports are showing a rather less brilliant
aspect, as will be seen by the following Chi- |
cago wires to R. Brent Mitchell: "The i
weather map showed no rains of importance in
the corn belt, and this was the cause of the
advance. Complaints continue to come from
the Ohio Valley and j from parts of Missouri
and Eastern Kansas and a few points in Ne
braska, These complaints eo far consist .of
the need of rain and more in the way of ap
, prehension than actual damage. They are suf
, flclent. however, to broaden speculative buy
, I Ing, frightening shorts and advancing the price.
, In the meantime thero are increased offer
, Ings of corn to this market, but from other
sections than those above noted. The action
of the market will certainly depend on tha
question of rain or no rain."

Seme cf the left-over bearish sentiment of j
final transactions on Saturday was still ap- j
parent In selling active around the better prices !
of the opening range. The rust afflicted por- j
tlor.s of Minnesota and the Dakotas were also :
said to be growing in area, the damage being j
estimated at Irom IS to 20 per cent of the ;
average crop in these section.*. Under these !
bullish conditions and with smaller world's j
Fhipments than expected, the optimistic bear I
apparently fair little upon which to base his 1
hopes. Short? covered and continued to cover j
at each eucceedint; advance in price. There j
were realizing sales also at each advanc. but j
the offerings quickly melted under the grow
ing demand. S^rtember climbed step by step |
to $1 03. Sales ty scalpers caused a reaction
in the September option toward the close to I
$1 O2S01 fC*;. The strength, however, waa }
well maintained to the end. j
A serious condition seems to confront the '
corn trade. Complaints of backward growth Â¦
and poor prospects became ao pronounced to-day
that bulls and bears were compelled to give 1
heed to thtm. September started at 63c to
53 Vic and advanced to 54 Vic. the closing fig
ure. Ci>mmisÂ«i.-,n houses had large buying or
ders from Souihv.-estera points, whsra dry, hot
weather appears to have created a sentiment
bordering consummation. The upward tendency
Â¦was most mark?:} in prices for the new crop
months. December starting with a gain of VÂ»4y
] <c at 51?feC and closing at 53Vic a net gaia
r.f 2tf62%& May >o!d up from 50V4c to 51c
at the opening to 62^c in the final trading, a
gain of 2Â»ic.
There was activity -in the oats market, which
shared the strength of corn and wheat. Sep
tember or-ened unchanged at 33*; c and ad
vanced to 34Vic. Some influential selling by
one of the speculative leaders checked the ad
vance and carried the September price back to
21};c at the close.
Apparently an effort was made to bull the
provision market at the start and higher prices
ruled. A large line of lard was thrown en the
market by one of the large packers and Its
effect was to stay the advance. The market
held strong, however, under a good commis
sion house demand, and the closÂ«! showed a
pain in September pork of 7Vjc. of 5c In lard
and of 2H- In ribs.

Charles Schoene, saloon-keeper, 99
Third street, secured a warrant from
Police Judge Conlan yesterday for the
arrest of Hervey E. Johnson on a
charge of passing a forged instrument.
The warrant has been placed in ' the
hands of Captain Martin, who has
wired to various points asking for
Johnson's arrest.
On August 4 Johnson called at
Schoene's saloon and represented him
self as secretary of Columbia Aerie of
the Order of Eagles at Vancouver,
Wash. He said he needed money and
produced a draft on the Commercial
Bank, Vancouver, for $250. It was
in his favor and purported to be
signed by C. S. Burchfield, president of
the aerie, and indorsed by Frank
Lackaff, treasurer. It purported to be
for a loan for ftlx months at 3 per
cent interest on collateral security.
Schoene took Johnson to his bank
and the money was paid. The draft
was later protested as a forged instru
ment. It was returned and Schoene is
held responsible for the amount..

Mr. John McKlnney,
A case was decided in Justice of the
Peace Golden's court yesterday for the
defendant in which J. B. Whitney
brought suit against Chief of Police
Wlttman. Whitney had placed $62 in
the Chiefs hands to pay the expense^
of bringing Rennie Thorsch, a default
ing employe, from Los Angeles to this
city. Thorsch was returned to San
Francisco and Whitney brought suit
against Wittman for the money on the
ground that the Chief of Police has
a fund of $10,000 allowed him for the
arrest and transportation of persons
charged with crime. Justice Golden
held that the charter did not contem
plate the use of the fund in the appre
hension of persons outside of the city
and county by the Police Department
of San Francisco and so decided in fa
vor of Chief Wittman.
Decides for the Chief.
An inmate of the home was Louis
B. Jessup. His mother, Hannah M.
Jessup, left $3000 to the institution,
the profits to be used for the benefit
of the boy and after his death the
fund was to be used for the good of
the home. It is charged by the pres
ent board of trustees that the former
board received $3676 80 principal and
interest on September 24, 1902. One
suit is for $818 93 against the Puget
Sourid Lumber Company and the for
mer trustees, and the second against
the same trustees and James A.
Snook & Co. It is charged that the
defendants in each case misappro
priated the money to their own use.
The defendants other than the trustees
are the persons who received the
money expended by the trustees for
purposes which were not, it is said,
within the purposes of the fund.

Temporary control of $1500 worth
of jewels now in the custody of the
property clerk at the City Prison is
sought by Public Administrator M. J.
Hynes, who yesterday applied to the
Superior Court for special letters of
administration upon the estate of Mrs.
A. Lippe.
The woman died at Agnew asylum
on August 8, after being in, the insti
tution for a couple of weeks. Mrs.
Llppe was the wife of a prize fight
promoter from the East and left him.
She was arrested on the streets of
San Francisco for drunkenness and
while in prison assaulted her cellmate.
She proclaimed that she was the
"queen of the pickpockets" and made
other statements which convinced
Judge Mogan that she was insane.
From Jail the woman was taken to
the Central Emergency Hospital and
from there to Agnew, where she died.
PUBLIC ADMINISTRATOR
WANTS CUSTODY OP ( IMS
Censure, direct and official, was
dealt out yesterday by a CoronÂ°r'Â»
jury to Dr. Joseph Ardenyi and Dr. J.
J. Moyer for the death of Mrs. Sarah
Cohn, wife c A Abraham Cohn of 723
Howard street on August 11. After re
citing that death followed septicaemia,
caused by a criminal operation by per
sons unknown to the jury, and that
the evidence showed that a secondary
operation had been performed by Drs.
Ardenyi and Moyer, the verdict goes
on to say:
Said perforations, according to the testimony,
were evidently caused by instruments use! by
the operating physicians. 1: having beÂ«a
brought out during the course of the. Investiga
tion that the operating physician aj well a#
the one who administered the aaecthetls
showed great incapacity, neglect and inat
tention.
We. the Jury, hereby censure the said phy
sicians, and recommend that the Board of
Medical Examiners investigate the matter.
At a previous session Dr. Ardenyf
admitted under oath to the Jury that
he had signed a death certiflcate oa
which he had written falsely that
death had been caused by heart fail
ure. He explained that he believed at
the time that the woman's death had
been caused by 'the anesthetic and he
desired to shield his young friend. Dr.
Moyer at Mayfle'd, from any blame in
the matter.
Coroner Leland consulted District
Attorney Bylngton with a view to hav
ing Ardenyi prosecuted and punished
for having issued a death certificate in
which the cause of death had been
knowingly concealed and a different
cause substituted. Byington advised
the Coroner that the essence of ths
crime, according to the Penal Code,
was the filing of such a certificate and
that, as Dr. Ardenyi had not filed tha
paper, but had given it to the under
taker, and as Detective Edward Gib
son had taken, it from the undertaker
it had not been filed and no prosecu
tion could be had.
Dr. J. J. Moyer of Mayfls!d testified
yesterday that upon invitation of Ar
denyi he administered one and a half
ounces of chlorcform to Mrs. Cohn
while Ardenyi performed the operation
of curetting, the operation occupying
about one hour.
He admitted that he had not ex
amined the woman's heart before ad
ministering the anesthetic, but said
that he had felt her pulse and found
it normal.
Moyer said that he did not observe^
that the woman was in a dangerous^
condition until the end of the opera
tion.
"How much experience have you had
in giving anesthetics?" the Coroner
asked.
Moyer refused to answer and main
tained a dicrntfied silence and the Cor
oner forbore to- insist upon a reply.
Ardenyi told the Coroner that
Abraham Cohn, the woman's husband,
had informed him that his wife had
been the victim of malpractice at the
hands of persons unknown to him and
requested Ardenyi to attend her and
do what he could to save her life. On
the previous examination Cohn swore
positively that he was unaware of his
wife's condition and that he had no
1 knowledge whatever as to her having
undergone any kind of a surgical or
other operation before ha called, for
Ardenyi.

A suit for $25,000 damages for in
fringement of a label and name has
been begun by the Whit* Rock Min
eral Springs Company against thÂ«
Ferndale Spring Water Company ot
Contra Costa County. The plaintiff Is
an Eastern concern. Judge Habbard
issued a temporary restraining order
in the case yesterday.
The Democratic local nominating con
vention will meet and organize at the
Alhambra Theater to-morrow evening.
When the county committee, Thomas
W. Hlckey chairman, met at Native
Sons'- Hall on July 7 and issued accord
ing to law the call for a convention of
the party no time was fixed for the lo
cal convention to assemble. The chair
man of the committee has now desig
nated August 17 as the date. The tem
porary roll, of delegates for the local
convention will be prepared by the
chairman and secretary of the Demo
cratic City and County Committee. The
framers of the official call did not
neglect to insert the important provi
sion relating to the temporary roll.
Affairs seem to be shaping up for a
big row in the Democratic convention.
Gavin McNab's followers are in posses
sion of the works and will make up the
temporary roll, hence the Horses and
Carts will get no advantage in the first
rnixup. The McNab factio elected 97
of the 16S delegates, and therefore has
a clear working majority of 26.
It Is highly probable that Charles J.
Heggerty will be put forward as the
choice of the minority faction for chair
man of the convention. Heggerty's de
votion to the principles of the party is
unquestioned. He stands so high in the
favor of Democrats of the O'Brien
school that he is prominently men
tioned as the party's candidate for the
office of United States Senator. His
voice has not that penetrating, far
reaching quality which is supposed to
lend special strength to a Senatorial
aspirant, but otherwise he is fitted to
receive such honors aa a Democratic
minority caucus may bestow. Practice
in the open air under the instruction
of a skilled master in voice training
should make Heggerty an ideal candi
date for the Democratic compliment.
Gavin McNab entertains t'..2 notion
that Heggerty does not possess the all
around accomplishment which the
chairman of a Democratic local nomi
nating convention should be able to
display. In Democratic circles Mr.
MoNab is regarded as an expert in the
line of organizing conventions. Thomas
W. ' Hickey, chairman of the Demo
cratic City and County Committeee, ac
cepts Mr. McNab's judgment without
question or quibble. Any hepl.r-.cy in
such acceptance would ..ost Hlckey the
chairmanship. Therefore Hickey holds
to the belief that some one other than
Heggerty should be chairman of the
convention. Ninety-seven Democrats,
whose names will adorn the temporary
roll to-morrow night, wlll~acquiesce in
the views of McNab as expressed
through Hlckey.
The minority deletater. consisting of
the Horse and Cart faction of seventy,
will probably make a deal of noise, and
then get into line under McNab's lead
ership. There Is some talk to- the ef
fect that O'Brien will bolt, organize
a rump convention, make nominations
and appeal to Ruef and Schmitz for
recognition on the official ballot. In
that manner it is said that the regu
lar McNab nominations could be ex
cluded from the Democratic column of
the ballot.
The regular Democrats do not talk
of nominating a ticket at the present
time. The avowed purpose of the early
meeting is to organize the convention
and pave the way for an effective
Investigation of the frauds perpetrated
on the day of the primary election.
Inquiry has- already disclosed the fact
that thirty votes In one precinct of
the Forty-third Assembly District were
cast by stutters. Gavin McNab Is firm
in his determination to bring all the
facts to light, so that the names of
the men who hired the stuffers may
be given to the public.'

Deputy State Controller "W. "vV. Doug
la? submitted hi? report. It stated
that he had spent three days investi
gating the books of the State Board of
Pharmacy and found that they were in
gcod order.
Douglaf paired criticism on expendi
tures through two sources which he
thoujrht cug-ht to be remedied. The
first was the unusually long sessions
the board was accustomed to hold, one
of which lasted forty-five days. The
members of the board were allowed J5
per diem, and members who attended
at a point away from their homes were
allowed io a day living expenses. Doug
las thought this was excessive.
He also complained of the attorney^
fees for services in the Legislature of
1903, when the State pharmacy law and
itinerate vendor's law was up for pass
age before that bodj*. These fees
fimounted to %2&~. Douglas stated that
"this was the first Inspection ever made
by the State Controller's office, and
that its subsequent order of turning
oxer of the State Board of Pharmacy's
surplus funds was the first issued to
this body.

Referring to the bonding of newer
expenditures, which was also attacked
under the same article, it waa held
that the provision was to be made for
sewer expenditures by using a speci
fied sum to be taken for that purpose
from the annual tax levy. The court's
decision on this matter is embodied
in the following excerpt of paragraph
2 of the Supreme Court's decision:
It IÂ« contended that bo much : of the ordl
nance as provides for the issuance of bond*
for tbe sewer system is void on the ground
that the charter provides that the Supervisors
are limited to pov.-er to provide In the annual
tax levy for a special fund to be used In thÂ»
construction of a general system of drainage
and sewerage. But the provisions of the char
ter under familiar rules of construction are
to be taken as a whole and are to be construed
harmoniously. In article 16. section 29 the
charter says: "When tho Supervisors shall de
termine that the public Interest requires' the
ccrittruetion cr acquisition of any permanent
municipal building or Improvement the cost
cf which in addition to the -ether expenses of
the city and county will exceed the Income
end revenue provided for the city and county
for one year, they must, by ordinance .passed
by the affirmative vote -of not less than four
teen members of tha board, submit a prcposl-
The charter provider In artlcla 2. chapter
1, section 2, that an ordinance shall embrace
but one eubject which â¢ball be expresaive of
itÂ« title. If any subject be embraced la an
ordinance and not expressive in Its title, such
ordinance ehall bÂ» void aa to so much thereof
aa Is not expressed In 1U title. Several courts
have decided that this clauee was left to the
consciences of the legislators. Nor 1Â« this
peculiar totals State/the same being the-cus
tom la other States where like provisions ex
isted and the eame conatruction was given by
the courts. There Is no mandate in tie char
ter of the city and county of San Francisoo
corresponding to that of the Jyltutto of
the State, and therefore it will be sufficient
upon thU subject to declare la accordance w^h
the uniform- construction of 6U ch provision,
that it 1Â« directory with the legislative "body
alone and not a subject of Judicial cognizance
But it may be added that, even if the |r OV 1sioa
be regarded as mandatory, the ordinance in
question "that of incurring a bonded Indebted"
ness." they ail belong to a general subject to
be submitted to the voters, "the expediency o?
inexpediency of bonding the city for specified
public improvements." uca
The action of the court on this mat
ter is as follows:
The Judgment of thlÂ« court therefore Is that
the Judgment of the trial court Is affirmed aa
to all save the cause of action touching oa
the acquisition of Telegraph Hill for a publio
park. As to that cause of action, the de
murrer of the defendants Is to be overruled.
If the proofs cf the plaintiff, upon trial, shall
correspond to the allegations of the complaint,
then upon that cause of action to enter its
Judgment In accordance with the complaint.
We concur. (Signed) Henshaw, McFaxland

The -charter provision etates that but one
subject should be embraced In a decision The
clause waa taken directly from a provision of
the State constitution, which haa been Inter
preted often by the Supreme Court as a "di
rection merely, persuasive only to the minds of
the legislators," end In no sense mandatory
The Supreme Court holds that In this case "the
distinct subject* were all germane, and might
rightly be Included in one ordinance."
COMPREHENSIVE TTOiES.
The decision of the Supreme. Court
in the other clauses under considera
tion is summed up in the following
words:
Under the earlier charter provisions It would
have been quite permissible to hold that the
law meant that each proposition severally was
to receive a two- thirds vote of those voting
upon It. but ex lndustrfa. this language has
been changed bo as to re<julre a two-thirds
vote of those voting at the special election.
Since these propositions were submitted sepa
rately, as the charter contemplates, the failure
of one to carry discs not affect the validity of
the others which have received the requisite
numbr of votes.
"At least two-thirds of the electors voting
thereon at such election shall be necessary to
eecure euch acquisition and to warrant tha
lesuanee of municipal bonds therefor."
It Is contended that tho proposition to lseua
bonds for the acquisition of lands for public
parks on Telegraph Hill did not receive the
assent of two-thirds of the voters. The Eleo
tlon Commissioners found that at the election
27,303 votes had been cast, of which 17,082
were In favor and S1S7 were against. The re
sult is that Ilb9 voters failed to Kjlster their
trill in the matter. While admitting that the
necessary two-thirds were In favor, it Is con
tended that there should have been two-thirds
of . the total vote, otherwise the bond issue
was not carried. It scarcely admits of doubt
that this section contemplates and requires the
favor of two-thirds of all the vote cast and
accordingly the proposition failed to carry.
On this point all doubt Is removed by sec
tion 4 of article 12 of the city charter, which
declares:
The court sustained the appeal of
Herbert E. Law on the issuing of
bonds for "5597,000 for the acquisition
of lands for additional public parks In
that portion of land known as Tele
graph Hill" on the ground that the
appropriation lacked the assent of the
necessary two-thirds of the voters. The
substance of the court's decision in this
matter is aa follows: â¢
PLAINTIFF SUSTAINED.
A decision of great Importance to the
future welfare of San Francisco was
handed down yesterday by the Su
preme Court. It decided that the issue
of bonds for public improvements la
valid. One exception to the decision
of the ruling of Judge SIosb of the Su
perior Court is made in the case of the
improvement of Telegraph Hill. Even
this was not lost on the question of the
Supervisors' right to make Â»uch an ap
propriation, but for the reason that it
failed of tho necessary two-thirds of
the pubilc vote required for the issu
ing of the bonds.
When the special bond election was
held last September till the proposals
for the/Issuance of bonds to cover the
expenses of city Improvements were
carried by two-thirds majorities. Her
bert E. Law. a capitalist and heavy
taxpayer of tHis city, brought suit
against the Citv and County of San
Francisco to restrain the issuing of
bonds on the ground that the Board of
Supervisors hud no authority under
the charter to .authorize the appropri
ation of JIT.OOO.O.K). This suit was de
cided in tho Suyerior Court, before
Judge Sloss, In favor of the city, and
Law, through his attorney. Henry C.
McPike, appealed to the Supreme
Court. The attorneys for the city were
City Attorney Percy V. Long and As
sistant W. I. Brobeck.
The Suprpme Court answered the ap
peal through a decision written by
Ju.sice Henshaw and concurred in by
all the Justices with the exception of
Chief Justice Beatty. viho did not sign
the decision. The court sustained
Judge Sloss' decision in section No. 1
of the answer, as follows:
"Providing for the Issuance, Bale and
redemption of bonds of the city and
county of San Francisco to the amount
of $17,771,000 for the following pur
poses: 1â $1,000,000 for the construction
of a new City and County Hospital;
2â $725,000 for tho construction of a
sewer system; 3â 53,695,000 for the con
struction of new achoolhouses and the
improvement of existing schoolhouses,
the acquisition of lands for the erect-
Ins thereon of new schoolhouses and
also for additional lands Jor play
grounds for established schools; 4 â
51,621.000 for the repair and improve
ment of the accepted streets of the
city; 5 â ?6&7,000 for the construction of
a new County Jail and additions to the
Hall of Justice; 6â $1,647,000 for the
construction of a building to be used
as a public library building and read
ing rooms and the acquisition of land
for the construction thereon of said
building; 7â5741,000 to be used for the
acquisition of lands as public parks,
to be used as children's playgrounds;
Sâ $330,000 for the acquisition of lands
for the extension of Golden Gate Park
northerly between Thirteenth and
Fourteenth avenues to the Presidio;
9â $293,000 for the acquisition of lands
for additional public parks in that por
tion of the city known as the Mis
sion."
Supervisor Braunhart said that the
Telegraph Hill proposition would be
again submitted to a vote of the peo
ple at a special election, together with
the Twin Peaks Park proposition, that
was defeated at the recent bond elec
tion.
The plaintiff claimed that education
â¢was under State Jurisdiction and that
the ordinance calling- for new schools
is Invalid. The court denied this and
said that the city authorities might
provide for new schools by issuing
bonds. " .
The court's review of the other
clauses was exhaustive in the matter
of references to former decisions and
rulings of previous authorities, but
short and concistl in its answer, de
claring that the action of the Su
pervisors in all cases was within their
rights as defined by the charter.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution directing the
clerk to omit from the notice of sale
of the bonds of -the city and county
so much of said bonds as may have
been declared invalid by the Supreme
Court and also to omit from notice of
b'.ds for printing and lithographing
said bonds all bonds that may have
bten declared invalid by the Supreme
Court.
The ruling of the court in regard
to the lands to be acquired, for the
use of the city as public parks for
children 13 Interesting and-instructlve.
The plaintiff insisted that 1 to acquire
lands for public parks for children's
playgrounds is beyond the power of
the municipal authorities and there
fore void. The answer thereto is apt
und forcible:
Xo person will question the wisdom of euch
an acquisition In a densely crowded munici
pality Ilka San Francisco, ar.d such play
srcur.ds aro "l>reath of lire" to thousands and
tens of thousands of the city's children. We
are of the opinion that the lands may be ac
quired lor park purpose*", . and that It is a
1'art of the uark purpose to devota some of
thefce lands to children's parks, so Ions as the
general public Is not denW access thereto.
While other parks are provided for the amuse
ment of adults, such as bicycle and autouio
bile paths and driveways, no provisions are
made lor the amusement of the children.
The chnrter Is held tu supersede the act of
l'.Wl and to confer that power upon the city,
It In next ursed that the bonded Indebtedness
thus Incurred may exceed the 15 per centum
of the af^etsed value of all real and personal
property in Han Francisco, thus violating the
provisions of the charter, but as the assess
ment lull of San Francisco exceeds $420,000,000
and us 16 por centum of this would be $113,000,

John O'Donnell, longshoreman, will be
absent from the water front for six
months, and his wife believes that her
deprivation of his society during that
period will be more than compensated
for by restored peace of mind and im
munity from assault and battery at his
hands.
The O'Donnells dwell at 115 Jackson
street, and about three weeks ago John
was arrested and charged with dis
turbance of the peace, the complainant
being his better half. She told Judge
Conlan of a long course of neglect and
abuse by the defendant, but pleaded
inability to support herself and chll-
"Ah, monsieur," she exclaimed, "eet
was ze ver-ay cru-el blow. My poor
Fi-fl him injaire no-bodee. Heem see
ze dead pig hangln' naked in ze shop
of ze Chi-na-man an' heem go een an'
smell ze pig. Po\if! Ze Chi-na-man
heem throw ze cleavaire an' eet strike
ze poor Fi-fi een ze reebs. Eet make
ze great hole. Ze blood come queeck
an' ze poor Fi-fl heem ron an' cry.
Mod Dfeu!"
Mme. Co-tin's affecting description of
the assault with a deadly weapon was
corroborated by her husband, Jules, of
1119 Dupont street, who added some
strong character testimony , to offset
the plea of provocation that the de
fendant's attorney was apparently pre
paring to launch. He had owned and
educated dogs of various breeds and
degrees of intelligence, but never had
he met a brighter or more discreet
canine than Fi-fl. If Fi-fi entered Ah
Hing's shop uninvited and smelt of the
deceased swine, his prompting was de
void of malice, or even mischief, and
consisted solely of the inquisitivenessâ
the investigatory instinctâ that was
such a charming trait of his nature.
No, there was no danger whatever of
Fi-fl's appropriating a portion of the
carcass. To smell it and thus satisfy
his curiosity as to whether it was gen
uine meat or a cleverly fashioned imi
tation was as far as" Fi-fl would have
gone, even if the cleaver had- not in
terrupted his examination. How did
M. Cotin know that? Simply because
M. Cotin knew that Fi-fl was amply
fed at home and that pork was no part
of his regimen. Pork might be relished
by such persons as the defendant, but
Fi-fl would starve to death sooner than
taste it, so attuned had his palate be
come to the confections bestowed upon
him by an Indulgent mistress.
Is it necessary to state that no
credence was. attached to Ah Hing's
plea that Fi-fl's intent as he ap
proached the pig was unmistakably
larcenous and that the cleaver was
hurled not to Inflict bodily Injury, but
merely to intimidate? The Judge
glanced once more at Fi-fl's wound
and Mme. Cotln's moistened orbs,
rubbed his own eyes and with faltering
voice pronounced Ah Hing guilty and
fined him $5.
Tears dimmed the dark eyes of Mme.
Madeline Cotin as she exhibited to
Police Judge Cabaniss an ugly wound
in the starboard side of her French
poodle, Fifl, and told how it had been
made by a cleaver in the hand of Ah
Hing, pork butcher in Chinatown.
When the policeman had testified that
he found Archibald Keller, tall, ragged,
unkempt and charged with vagrancy,
drunk and incapable on Market street
at midday, the defendant smiled de
ripively and spoke as follows:
"That Is elmply a repetition of the
old etory that in this city the law te
discriminative. If my clothes were new
and fashionably cut I would not be
here. This policeman would have placed
me In a hack and sent me home. But
he knew I was only a poor working
man. That's why he arrested me, and
not because I was drunk."
"Let me look at your hands," sug
gested Judge Fritz, and Archibald
Keeler submitted for inspection a pair
of palms that displayed more soil than
evidence of toll. Further Inquiry elic
ited the information that to the knowl
edge of the police Mr. Keeler had in
dulged In no manual, labor harder than
begging since he came here from no
where or anywhere three years ago.
Then he was remanded for sentence.
dren if he were sent to Jail. The Judge
kept the case on the calendar until last
Friday, when he discharged John, with
a warning to amend his ways if he de
sired to evade a long term of imprison
ment. John, proceeded from the court
room to his residence, where he gath
ered up and pawned all his spare ward
! robe and with the money thus obtained
he got drunk and went home and beat
his wife.
"It's useless to try to straighten him
up," said Mrs. O'Donnell to the Judge
yesterday, "and I don't care what you
I do with him."
S "You seem to be a thoroughbred
human brute, John O'Donnell," said the
Judge to the defendant, "and jail is the
best thing I can prescribe for your dis
ease. When do you want to be sen
j tenced?"'
! "Right now," was the growling re
sponse. *
"Six months in the County Jail."

"I don't like your town," said Jennie
Snyder to Judge Fritz, "and If you let
me ero I'll get out of it Just as soon as I
can."
"Tour departure would be a sad blow
to the town," quoth the Judge, "but it
must be borne, I suppose, after you
have served the twenty-four hours to
which I now sentence you."

George Leibert and his wife, Mary,
dwell apart, and with the woman their
four children reside at 113 Grove street.
It was there that George disturbed the
peace and was arrested for it last Sat
urday on complaint of Mary, who tes
tified that he insisted on taking away
his progeny in violation of his verbal
pledge to let them remain with thÂ»Ir
mother. George did not deny that he

which they were neglected by their
