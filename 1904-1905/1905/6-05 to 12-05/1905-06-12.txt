-In diplomatic circles here' it Is felt that
Great Britain can now play a great role
in seconding the President's initiative by
restraining her ally and counseling mod
erate \u25a0 terms. Harsh and humiliating
terms would not be accepted, and. for that
reason diplomatic circles express tho
greatest skepticism as to whether Japan,
elated by her wonderful victories, will he
reasonable enough to offer a basis whicH
Russia can possibly , accept. , If. at the
end Russia were forced . to . humble \u25a0 her
self In the dust, her Ignominy would
spur her to seek revenge as Alsace and
Lorraine did for many years.. â¢
" There is an Indefinite amount of gossip
here about Japan's terms, wit it is almost
altogether irresponsible, .the Jt best In
formed members of the diplomatic corps,
even the British Embassy", being con
vinced that, while the main outlines are
matters of common knowledge in Ameri
ca and in the chancellories of Europe,.
Japan has not revealed her exact terms
even ' to her ally.
WHAT RUSSIA WOULD CONCEDE.
'â¢-_ â¢ Russia is not likely to * prove recalci
trant. According to the best opinion she
la prepared to abandon the whole of her
Manchurian adventure and give guaran
tees. The rub will come upon the quw
tion', of an indemnity. \u25a0 which.V it is thÂ©
consensus in" diplomatic clrclea, Japan
will exact, but If it should be made mod
erate and sugar-coated, so that it could
beliquidated by the sale -of the! Chinese
Eastern Railroad and the cessation **oC
Russian property and - leases"- In. ..the
Kwantung Peninsula, the demand might
be accepted.
Russia probably will Insist on -holding
the "\u25a0'; railroad ' to Vladivostok * through
Northern \ Manchuria and will never sub
mit'to the humiliation of disarmament' ln,
her, only, port on the* Pacific /nor to-.thÂ»
inhibition against having warships, in
those '.waters. Considering the * situation
of 'â¢ the '' two countries, members of tho
diplomatic cofps feel that Japan's status
in.the'Pacinc U so firmly fixed that she
can ' afford '. to dispense with the exaction
of so bitter a 'condition.;

"Keep on, for; God's sake;! hang tight!"
yelled Simpson from the' other; side'of
the boat. "I'll. be there In a minute."' ;'
Slowly he crawled around to where! the
boy clung, encouraged ; by s the \u25a0'\u25a0 words ito
a new effort. But the struggle i wast too
much for the ; youthful; strength; of Mohr
and . he finally.; slipped off : thd v Jboat .. it
was then L that ; Simpson freed ' one ( of 'i .his
hands and ; seized \u25a0 his . companion ? by/ the'
hair and held him above" the water. V For,
half an hour he maintained this position/
supporting i the insensible > boy. U.Then : to
his horror he; felt his arm , grow, numb.
With ; all the c power." of his ; will \u25a0; he \\ strug-;
gled Ito retain command; of. his ; muscles.
At last : he felt his fingers \ refuse . to ; hold
longer ' and ' with S his ' heart ;* sick . within
The party o"f five started from the Van
Ness avenue wharf at about 1 o'clock
yesterday afternoon. Their intention
was to cruise over to Tiburon in the lit
tle boat Ease, which belonged; to- the
Mohr brothers. All went well until the
approach to Tiburon was reached. Young
Alfred Mohr, aged 18, who- attended the
Lick High School, sat on the side "of the
boat. It was a dangerous position, | but
no one thought of serious trouble until
a sudden gust of wind rolled the vessel
to one , side,-, and Mohr; slipped \u25a0 off. f* He
screamed as he f ell, \u25a0" and his brother
rushed to the side of the boat to try to
pull him in. The sudden movement cost
both of them their lives, for in a twink
ling" the frail craft was I overturned ' and
all were struggling in the water. Only
two of '. the party, Williams and Edwin
Mohr, were able to swim. \u25a0â¢ Williams got
away on the spar, which he loosened, and
Mohr started to head for the shored about
half a mile distant. That . was ; the last
seen of him. He must have perished
quickly. : . ' . ; .; ,"."\u25a0.-
In the meantime the force of the,cur
rent .was dragging the overturned boat
and Its living cargo" Into \ the ' Raccoon
Straits. There the water swirled around
the boys and * ; tugged in '. a' : seeming effort
to force them to loosen their, holds.* V Al
fred Mohr .was the weakest of ; the three
and he soon snouted that he was about
to co down, v â¢;\u25a0. .-;\u25a0 , \u0084.^: ''.-\u25a0'\u25a0.-\u25a0? -".1 : . :
lation of distance, and Williams had. been
lost. But Holsworth retained his steadi
ness of mind and saved the man. .'/
The third hero, was Williams himself.
He saw as soon as the accident happened
that the five of them would never be able
to hang on the overturned craft and
keep it afloat, Working like, a demon, he
managed to unloosen the sparj and with
this frail support he drifted away from
the others. Then came his rescue by the
Peters. Hardly able to utter; a syllable,
he managed to gasp, "There are more,"
and then he fell senseless to the deck. No
one was visible at first, but -soon the
Peters came in sight of the overturned
craft with the two boys clinging to it. A
boat was lowered and they were safely
brought on board. When found Simpson
was unconscious, but the force of his will
had so tightened his bony fingers to the
eide of the little sailboat that when his
mind became a blank he still maintained
his saving hold. The Mohr brothers were
nowhere in sight.
The three survivors were picked up by
a boat's crew from the Peters and
brought to the Harbor Emergency Hos
pital for treatment. Williams and Hoi
rcan were able to go to their homes in a
few hours, but Simpson was so nearly
gone that except for the heroic work or
Dr. Josef Manson, who was on board the
Peters at the time of the rescue, he would
never have reached shore alive, and he
still lies in the hospital.
Edwin J. Mohr was 23 years of age and
he had been employed by P. Hart &
Co. Alfred ilohr. about IS years of age,
was a student at the Lick High School.
The rescued men were in the water
more than two hours before they were
picked up by the tug. Their boat had
overturned when just off Tiburon ana
the strong tide had carried them clinging
to the sides of the vessel down three
miles through the Raccoon Straits and
to the west of Alcatraz. Alfred Mohr,
the younger of the brothers, became ex
hausted and sank before the eyes of his
companions while I they were still in the
straits." Just what happened to the other
brother no one knows. There Is a pos
sibility that he swam ashore and is alive
on Angel Island, but it is almost certain
that he, too, became exhausted and sank
to his death. As soon as the Peters baud
brought in its cargo of rescued it set out
again In- the rescue work, but darkness
coon fell upon the bay.
I The accident and the following rescue
developed new heroes whose names
thould be added to the long list of those
who have done .brave deeds at sea. The
first is Simpson, one of the sailing party,
who at the risk of his own life hung on
to the boat with one hand. Until the fin
gers of the other hand grew numb and
refused to obey his will he dung with
wonderful tenacity to the insensible body
of the younger Mohr.
The second was Tom Holsworth. neph
ew of Captain Tom Holsworth and of the
came school of .seamen. It was his sharp
eyes that told the pUot that the floating
thing in the bay was a living man. and
not a mere block of wood. Quickly the
pilot turned the boat until It was headed
toward the body- There, '; clinging to .. a
spar, was Williams, a roan of perhaps 60
years. He was nearly ready to , give up
an<J drop off, but he held up one hand to
the vessel as a piteous appeal for Instant
help. With a true eye and a steady hand
Holsworth was waiting on the eide of the
boat with a life-buoy in "his: hand. Per
fectly the saving cork sailed into the air
and alighted â¢ over tne .extended arm. A
sinsrle false etep. the slightest â¢ miscalcu-
Edwla J. Mohr and his brother ' A
lfred, who called on the bay In a tiny
crab boat yesterday afternoon, .were
drowned ivten the boat capwlzed near
Tibcron. Three other occupants of the
craftâ Arthur Simpson of Sl3 Sbotvrell
Htreet, F. S. Williams of 1014 Vallejo
ntreet and S. B. Holman of ,1428 fil
bert street â were saved from a like
fate by the watchfulness of Tom Hols

. \ln ,an" effort to learn the sentiment
of- the members of the association re

take a referendum vote on the question.
This voter was completed to-day and
resulted: In 155 of the members voting:
to remain neutral during the: trouble,
and in" three members voting to compel
the -.teamsters to. obey orders., The- de-.

TEAM OWNERS
REMAIN ALOOF
Mrs. Louise Worthington spent yester
day getting acquainted with 'her three
children, none of whom she had seen for
four years previously to her release from
the State prison at San Quentln on Friday
afternoon. Four year 3 ago the father.
William H. Worthington, ceased taking
any of the little ones with him on his
frequent visits to their mother, the ica
gon being that they were "getting old
enough to ask questions," and it was
thought better not to let them know too
much at the.'r tender age even of tvhat
they miift learn later about their mother.
"Why does mamma stay?" "What Is she
doing there with all these women?" "Why
doesn't she come home with us and pay
v.-, a visit?" were among the dozens of
queries put by the puzzled tots to their
father, who could just hold back the
tears from his eyes Â«?ach time he. left the
relentless prison and the woman who had
been torn from his side with those child
ish questions coming fast.
So the woman who has served eight
of th<? twenty five years of prison life, to
which shf was condemned for the killing
of a man who had led her into the ways
of misery Is again familiarizing herself
with h^r little ones. They have changed
greatly In the four years they have been
out of her sight, but the only surprise
there was for the devoted mother" was"
their size. By photographs taken of them
every year by her husband she had kept
their features before her, but the photo
graphs had not recorded the healthy
growth that had been theirs, and the
old trick of the eye in preserving the size
of an object when last observed left her
unprepared for the sight of her enlarged
offspring.
CHILDREN QUESTION NO .MORE.
"That was the most surprising thing-" to
me when I came home," said Mrs.
Worthington, "the size of the children.
I couldn't realize they were mine. Their
faces were perfectly familiar to me be
cause cf the photographs, but to see three
Euch tall children in the place of the al
most bablcs*that I had last clasped In
toy arms \u25a0 wemed Very strange to me,
though 'everything is strange now. My
children all remembered me, evert the
youngest- girl, now 'only 11. The next
is a girl of 14 and the oldest a boy of 16.
They must realize now where I have
b^en, but they do not ask questions any
moxe. i
"I feel very nervous since my release.
I was greatly run down while in prison.
One's feelings, or at least miÂ«e. after a
long period of incarceration, are that you
must get used to everything all over
again. I feel a buoyant sense of liberty,
but it all seems new to me, and I must
le&rn all about the world again, for I
have just come into it. They treated me
very kindly in prisonâ for several years
I have been the trusty for Mrs. Belle
Van Doren, the matronâ but the dreadful
monotony of It all nearly drives you in
cane. You wish to see something new.
You Â£et tired of the' same walls, even
the same faces, though 1 never liked to
6ee a new one come In as some did. Many
a time I thought 'Oh. If - could only be
alone, where I could not see anything or
any body, nor think of anything.'
"I didn't txpect to be released on Fri
day. I thought my parole was coming,
but not so soon. . I was all unprepared
and I couldn't fully realize my good for
tune until I was on the bus on my way
to Greenbrae. The . other women all
crowded around and congratulated me
wben the announcement was made and
threw rice after me when I left. I was
almost dazed, and as the world I had been
taken from began to unfold again about
me I became nervous. Even the build
ings looked strange, and I was bewildered
when I got on the ferry-boat among the
crowd. \u25a0 . . -
FAMILY IS RETJXITED.
' "Then when I walked up to the front
door of my house, - where my husband
and children were, it eeemed as if a cloud
had fallen from my senses and I had
awakened from a trance. It was rapture
to find that my darling children remem
bered me and rapture still greater to see
horr jflad they were at my return. .They'll
realize now why I was over there ;lntha>
big place so long without payings them ;ac
visit, but they won't talk about it.
'I want to get back my weight now
and get sttcng, co I can' be a help to
my husband, who has been so faithful to.
me. I ran be happy with him and my,
childrenâ very happy. 1' will have -to go
to a hospital for a time to have my spine
treated, but then 1 will get strong again.
I want to forget all about those horrible
eight years, excepting the persons, about
me who were kind. I will never forget
them "-' /

i her forehead as if brushing away the
priton cobwebs from her mind, and
â¢looked with a -wan but proud smile at

the matter of violating tho Sherman,
anti-trust law they will have,- less time
and energy for fighting a rate bill.
Eastern seaboard cities -. are also
much concerned in the case, because it

to the so-called exempt classes, includ

CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. June 11.â President
Roosevelt will receive at noon to-morrow
a delegation of members of the American
Asiatic Association, representing the cot
ton textile industry. The delegation will
make various protests against the pres
ent interpretation of the Chinese exclu
sion law, which has caused the commer
cial guilds ir. China to threaten a boycott
after August on all American schools,
business, goods, products and ships.
For the ten months ending May L 1905,
the .exports of cotton cloths to China
v ere valued at J21.125.835. There is a rea
fonable prospect that the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1905. will show a volume of
export trade worth 527,000.000. This is the
greatest trade In cotton goods ever car
ried on between America and China. It
represents probably 10 per cent of the
total value of the American cotton pro
duction. If the boycott becomes effective
cotton manufacturers fear the necessity
of selling 10 per cent of the total produc
tion in th* markets already well supplied
will create a cutthroat competition,
which will demoralize the Industry.

LOS ANGELES. June 11.â At the con
clusion of a pontifical mass to-day Bish
op Conaty made an announcement of in
terest to Catholics all over the State, and
which has behind it probably a double
meaning for those of tn:s part of the
State. Without giving any intimation of
what was coming the Bishop read a mes-
from the Papal Secretary at Rome
announcing the appointment by the Pope
of Father P. Harnett, for years Vicar
Genera! of the diooese of Los Angeles
and Monterey, to the position and rank
of Domestic Prelate. This means that
Father Harnett will hereafter and for
life be a member of the Pope's personal
official household.
At the time of the elevation of Bishop
Montgomery and before the appointment
of Bishop Conaty had been announced,
prr.min^nt members of the church here
and elpowhere urged upon the authorities
of the church their desire that Father
Harnctt be appointed B!shop of this dio
oÂ«Â»Â«Â«e. When Bishop Conaty cams he
learne<3 of this feeling for Father Har
nett and the two have since been work
lnp constantly together.
Nearly n year ago Bishcp Conaty took
up the matter of securing for Father
Harnett the appointment which he an
nounced to-day. H*> did not even tell his
secretary, and when he told his congre
gation to-day that was the flrst any per
son here except the Bifhop him?elf knew
of it. The appointment gives Father
Harnett the right to wear the purple
short mantle with the rochet and beretta.

Professor Thwaites is to give lectures
that will Include accounts from these
journals. The first account of the Lewis
and Clark expedition was prepared by J*.
Bi<J<Jle of Philadelphia In ISI4 from what
were then supposed to be the only origi
nal Journals of pereons connected with
the expedition.
In IÂ£lB Thomas Jefferson, while Presi
dent of'lhe United States, collected other
notebooks and journals cf members of
the expedition and placed them in the
possession of the National, Philosophical
Association. It was supposed, too. that
these documents were "the only cprrect
records of the Journey undertaken by-
Lewis and Clark's company.
Professor Thwaites, however, secured
possession several years ago of five vol
umes of manuscript notes by Captain
Clark, together with other valuable notes
cf the Journey into Oregon, and from
these he has compiled the first complete
and RAHbentlc account of the notable-ex

u-ith what he calls the "Western phase"
cf American history. The fact that Pro

Conteat I* PI a red on Presidio Grounds
and Losers Are Unable,' to
Score a Goal.
The Parnell team played all around the
McÃrides in the .Gaelic football game
played yesterday at the Presidio Athletic
Grounds. At the md of an hour's play
the Parnells had nine points, without al
lowing their opponents, to score.
| It. was, a one-sided contest, as the win
ning team showed superior knowledge of
the finer points of T the : game. The losers
were completely baffled at times by the
clever, manner, in which the *Parnell men
dribbled the ball up the field and passed
it to their team mates.- But few times
during the game did the McÃrides have
the ball near their opponents', goal. At the
end of the. first half the Parnells had
eeilt thq ball sailing over their opponents!
goal six times. In the next half they
scored three more goalr . .
Many substitutes jj were played on â¢ the
McÃrideteam; as! some of their best men
did not show up. This probably accounts
for : their .poor \u25a0 showing. | The following

OAKLAND. .June. ll. â Just one week
after the members â¢ of r the -Cooks' and
Waiters'- Union went-on strike against
the Restaurant' Owners' Association of
Oakland to enforcethe demand of the
union that the employers sign the
agreement presented, the first drastic
step in the battle between the employ
ers and employes has been taken. The
wholesale butchers, in sympathy with
the restaurant owners, have notified
the proprietors of the â¢ retail -butcher
shops of this city that are supplying
the restaurants which are/Indorsed by
the Cooks' and Waiters' Union that un
less they cease supplying these restau
rants their wholesale supplies of meat
will be cut off. '
\u25a0Local labor leaders claim, that the acX
tion of the .wholesale butchers will not
affect in the least the restaurant own
ers who" have stood by the union. They
say." th,at. the California Co-operative
Meat Company will -be able to supply
the needs of all' the restaurants af
fected *by trie "action - of the : whole

owners will, take the same view of the
case as do the union men remains to

'OAKLAND, June 11.â Joseph Gerkin. a
driver for; the Anchor' Brewery, 33 years
old; accidentally -.i t "nd Killed himself
this afternoon with a shotgun while bunt
ing on Thomas Johnson's ranch. in Mo
raga Valley. Gerkin was found dying
from a jagged ' wound in his left chest,
above the heart, by-. Henry Behrmann,
his companion, who had left Ger_in about
two hours before. .
! Gerkin was lying on a hillside, where he
had rolled after the fatality occurred. He
was conscious, but could not tell how
he had .been shot. It is supposed he
slipped while climbing the hill and dis
charged his shotgun, one shell In which
was empty -when the weapon was found
a lew feet above where Gerkin was lying.
Behrmann and Johnson carried the
wounded man to a wagon and drove to
the Receiving Hospital, but Gerkin died
on the way.- Dr. L. L. Rlggin, who ex
amined the wound, said its direction was
such that it could not have been self
inriictc-d. Behrmann. an employe at Fred
Becker's meat market; and Gerkin were
close friends. Behrmann said his com
panion had left him about two hours be
fore he was found to hunt rabbits and
squirrels. His failure to return caused
Behrmann to go in search. . The. victim
was a German wlt.iout relatives in this
country. He resided at 105S Alice street.
He was a, member of^the or^er of Her
mann Sons, the Eagles and the Shell
Mound Rifle and Pistol Club. The Coroner
took charge of the body.
OAKLAND. June 11.â Angered -because
her mother corrected h*r for receiving
letters from a boy sweetheart. Maude
Coulstlng, 13 years old, but 17 years in
appearance, fled from her home, 516 Third
street, San Francisco, Wednesday. The
missing girl has left no trace of her
whereabouts. The distracted mother,
Mrs. James Coulsting, reported the case
to-day to the Sheriffs office in the hope
that the officsrs on this side of the bay
might catch a clew to her daughter.
Last Sunday the .girl, who had been a
prominent, worker in Christian Endeavor
circles, asked her mother for permission
to go to the Presidio to visit some girl
friends. Mrs. Counting objected. The girl
appealed to her father, who gav^ his con
sent, and the mother reluctantly ac
quiesced. Maude did not return untll-7;30
o'clock that evening, much to the:annoy
ance of the mother, who sharply correct
ed her daughter. The girl resented her
parent's reprovings, but the subject was
soon dropped.
Tuesday Mrs. Coulstlng saw Maude
reading a missive, full of endearments
from Carl Griffin, a boy acquaintance.
Again the mother had occasion to declare
her objections to her daughter's conduct.
Mre; Coulsting told Maude she would not
permit her to receive such letters. It was
this verbal chastising which led to the
daughter's disappearance, according to
what the mother reported to the authori
ties. The day following Maude departed.
The parents on Thursday began to look
about. The last time the girl was seen
by any of her acquaintances was on
Wednesday afternoon at 1:30 o'clock,
when she went to the residence of Mar
tha Erlckson, 35? Vi Brannan street. Miss
Erickson could give the parents no help
toward finding the child.
The missing girl Is fair, large for her
age, five feet three inches tall .'and
weighs 105 pounds. When she left home
she wore a white straw hat edged with
black velvet and trimmed with black and
green silk; a blue box coat trimmed with
red \u25a0 diamond-shaped velvet on breast;
light. green silk skirt, dark green figured
flowers; white silk shirt waist, green and
pink cobweb collar, black ribbons In hair,

to joshing the: house. \u0084It was one contin

their bow till . the last ' skit was over.

Gould and Miss Suratt have a line of
stuff that Is a; bit more refined than that
of. their rivals, but- It* ls funny and worth
going miles' to hear and * see. Gould ia
esptcially clever in the. song line, and he
had the house" whistling^ and singing last
night when he gave the "come on" sig

of things to interest the crowd and while
they are now all new and original, they

The cruisers Chicago and Boston will
sail to-day for Portland, Oregon, where
they are to be features of the early ses
sions of the Lewis and Clark Exposition.
Elaborate preparations have been made
for their reception in the snappy city on
the Willamette. President Henry W.

Williams and prominent city officials^
will go several miles down the Willam
ette River to meet the warships and the
offlccrs in command of them. On arrival
In Portland a salute will be rlred by the
National Guard of Oregon, which will be
assembled on a hill site near the expo
sition grounds.
The war vessels will be in the Willam
ette for about three weeks. During their
sojourn there a large number of enter
tainments have been arranged for the
pleasure of the officers and also for the
eallors. The cruisers had expected to
fail for the north about two weeks ago.
but were delayed on account of several
o! the officers being members of a court
martial which has just been adjourned.
From Portland the Chicago and Boston

WHITE EAGLE, O. T.. June 10.â Replying:
to your telegram of to-day I respectfully advise
that no buffalo of. any description will De
slaughtered at the celebration to-morrow tn
honor of the National Editorial Association on
tribal or leased lands by Miller Brothers, nor
will anything Inhuman or objectionable be
permitted. Prior to the receipt of your tele
gram this evening. Joe Miller had^killed one
old male buffalo on land owned by himself,
the meat of which he proposes to serve to the
editors. God pity the editors'. No more buf
falo will be killed, however, as the Millers
propose to raise a large herd on their ranch.
Respectfully. .- â¢ NOBLE. Superintendent.
An Immense grand stand, extending
around the arena, was built tor the vis
itors. . The arena . itself v was a half-mile
long and one-third mile -wide. The Ponca
and Otoe Indians, whose lands are being
allotted, had planned > a celebration to
take place some time during the spring,
to which they "expected to invite all the
other Indians In the Territory to help
them celebrate the dissolution of their
tribal ties. ,This was arranged to take
place at the same time as the editors'
visit. The ranch bought thirty-five-bur
falo in Montana and planned a buffalo
chase by the Indians.
A buffalo dinner was one of the day's
features. Each one of the special guests
(and there were, altogether, not less than
2000) was served with a piece of buffalo
meat in connection with the dinner.
Besides the buffalo hunt the programme
Included a Wild West show, with roping
and riding contests, Indian dances, a
stage robbery and a miniature reproduc
tion of the rush into the Cherokee strip.
There was a parade, led by the Indians,
attired in ; their paint and feathers, fol
lowed by the . ox team and prairie
schooner, and ending with an $18,000
automobile.
-.WASHINGTON, June . 11.â Secretary
Hitchcock has received the following dis
patch from Superintendent Noble, in
charge of the' Ponca Indian Agency, Ok
lahoma : ,
Fifty thousand persons , were enter
tained by Miller Brothers at the 101
ranch to-day, the visit of the National
Editorial Association to < the ranch being
made the occasion ' for; a buffalo hunt, a
buffalo dinner and an Indian celebration.
BLISS. Okla., June 11.â Chased by
twenty-five cowboys and a band of Indl-'
ans headed by old Geronimo, a.^buffalo
was brought to bay. at 101 ranch^ to-day
and shot to death by pr. v H. E. Thomas,
a clubman from Chicago. Thomaa fired
the. ; shot from his automobile. The
chase lasted for several ' hours.
As soon as the beast fell old Geronimo,
despite his years, leaped from his . horse
and fired two shots into the buffalo and
then, with his hunting knife, cut its
throat. .-...-â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0' \u25a0â¢ \u25a0
"I might talk if there .was a 'chance
of getting ou t of this place," said
Adolph"; Steffens, the ballot-box stuffer,
toVa Call representative at San Quentin
yesterday. The convict : is chafing un
der; his three- Jtcar sentence for; dis
honest voting In the.district in which
Frank A. Maestretti isUhe boss, j I Stef
fens seemed to realize his position more
keenly yesterday^ than \u25bahe has hitherto
and was in somewhat of a mood to talk;
;,"It is awful," he said. "I can't'asso
ciate with these men here. ~ I am prac
tically alone, and I have over two years
more of it to stand. : Even when j I g e t
out the disgrace will stick to me. Peo
ple will say that I am an -ex-convict."
And Steffens' eyes filled with tears.
"If I' could -talkâ well, it is better
for a man in my position to, say noth
ing," he continued. '.'I. suppose | that I
will have "to stand this./ When I get
out :I: I will live honestly and do the
best . l can. .
"Meastretti was acquitted? Well, I.
am glad of that. " He has three mother
less children to look after, I can't'
say that Maestretti is responsible "for
anything. I. won't say it. If he was
convicted I would not want to have
anything to do with sending him to
jail." -*
At times Steffens was on the point
\>f breaking down altogether. ".The
convicts here hate me ;â¢ because I will
have .nothing to do .with .them," -he
said. "It's awful to be thrown in with
thieves and murderers. One reason
why the other prisoners are sore at
me is because I was a fireman. They
say that firemen and hackmen are no*
good because they stand in with; the
police."
"Would you tell all that you know
about the happenings in that booth at
the primary election \u25a0 if there- was, -a
chance to get out of here?" was asked.
A look of tense eagerness appeared
on .the convict's face. "I," might â but
there is no chance of that now," , he
said sadljv "I'm*in for it; I had better
say. nothing at all." \u25a0
And the follower of Maestretti swal
lowed a big lump In his throat and
clutched the convict shirt as though he
restrained himself with an effort from
tearing it off.
' "Well," he proceeded, after recovering
with, an effort, "they can't say. I was a
thief or a' crook, anyhow.", I am going to
keep away from the other prisoners here
at any cost. My God! I don't want to be
like them. But this thing will follow me
all through 'my life. When I do. get out
of here crooks who have seen me in the
prison will try to talk to me. I can't get
away from it. It is awful."
The prisoner inquired : Into the details
of the Maestretti trial with interest.^ He
seemed to be surprised Twhen! he. was told
the result. < -'\u25a0. '"â¢;. v : : , \u25a0/ /â¢;
"Is it straight that he was acquitted? "
he asked with an expressiori of marked
incredulity ou his face. . ; fcs J â.. .
,|Ha was assured that it^wasjtrue. -
I {"How 'many lawyers^ did j-, Maestretti
have? How long was the "jury out?" :
The ' prisoner seemed verr much" inter
ested In the case of Rebstock. AVhen told
that he Had been recommended for mercy
by the Jury, Steff ens exclaimed : "Well,
won't he go to State's prison?" . -. ,
There was a- touch of bitterness in his
voice and an exclamation on the tip of
his tongue, but he recovered himself. â¢ .
About a month ago Foreman Andrews
of the Grand Jury. visited the prisoner.
Stcffens was at first inclined to be com
municative, but- after. a pri"ate. interview
with his sister, the convicted ballot box
stuffer refused to talk further. â¢
Pistrict Attorney vÃylngton said last
night that there was even yet a chance
for Steffens to regain his freedom if he
would give full information -on the elec
tion frauds. '.'Of course, that would be
up. to the Governor of the State," the Dis
trict Attorney explained. ''But I have no
doubt that if Steffens would tell all he
knew it would help him considerably."
The Grand Jury is still v.-orking on the
election frauds/. Foreman Andrews is
trying hard to collect enough evidence to
warrant a second indictment' against
MaestrettL ' '\u25a0 . -.
"He cannot -be indicted on the same
charge; of course," said District Attorney
Byington. t "But if enouch evidence is
gathered to warrant^the belief that he at
tempted to induce some one else to per
jure himself the Grand Jury may return
a second indictment for subornation to
perjury." / ; f " x

To the EdUÂ°r of The Call:
I believe the attention of. the Golden Gate
Park authorities should be called to the
language in vogue on that portion of the
children's playground reserved for base
ball grounds for youngsters.. ... One can
not tarry there for even a lew minutes
to watch tbe boys at play without suffer
ing a shock to his ears from the most
atrocious obscenity, which grates the
I more harshly, coining, as it does, from
j tbe lips cf mere babes. Women who have
'stopped there 'once do not make a rais
| take of doing ho again, but throughout
1 esch afternoon scores of strangers are
' attracted to the spot, only to be sent
!aÂ»ay with a blush on their cheeks.;,
! I am not exaggerating when I say that
ithe atmosphere of the Infantile ball
! grounds is constantly polluted by cursing
j and vicious vulgarity while the boys are
iat play; in fact. I have come to believe
ill- frequently, have to pass that way)
[ that ability to use the coarse language
An, Observer Calfs the Attention of the Authorities and
Parents to a Deplorable Evil

IF there were any especial feature to trade last week it was the j
pronounced falling off in business on the New York Stock Ex- j
change. The total sales on Thursday were only 232,500 shares
and on Friday 176,900. When it is considered that only ten days or
so ago the daily sales exceeded 1,000,000 shares and that a month .
ago they were 'running as high as 1,500,000 shares, the decline in
business' in this great investment and speculative market will strike
even the indifferent and uninterested observer. Meanwhile the
price of seats on the Stock Exchange has declined to $7^s<>V 2 g 2inst
$78,000 ten days ago aad $83,000 in April.
As there has been no recent -lock panic to cause this deprecia- j
tion in the volume of trading and the price of seats during the past j
two or three weeks, the whole street has been guessing as to the j
underlying cause of it, but with no definite result. The cold lact
remain's that the stock market has fallen fiat, and that is all there
is to it. An unusually large amount of Wall-street literature, known j
in the jargon of the street as "dope," has been circulated during the j
past few days insisting that everything is all right, that the general j
prosperity of the country, the abundance and ease of money and the ,
good crop prospects warrant a continuance of investment- buying j
and the present plane of values, but these arguments have z\>- \
parently fallen upon deaf public ears, for the steam has leftthtrj
market' for the time being. Meanwhile a jew cautious and con- j
servative financiers of national reputation have lately been advis- |
ing the public to go slowly for the present in their stock operations, |
zs quotations are as high as they will stand from a dividend-paying j
point of view, and their advice is evidently having its ettect.
Bur while Wall street is stagnant the general business^qf, the j
country continues in excellent condition. The bank clearings for the j
past week show an increase of 51.8 per cent over the same week j
in 1904 and the aggregate clearings ran up to $2,700,000,000. or j
about $200,000,000 over the normal, with every one of the forty i
most important cities except Cincinnati and Buffalo showing, a gain, j
Soxr.e of these gains were immense, such as 72.2 per cent at New
York, 64-4 at Philadelphia, 29.8 at Boston, 32.9 at San Francisco, j
25.3 at Pittsburg, 16.3 atÂ»Chicago, and so on. These great gains
over 1904 show the current and general expansion in business.
Gains cf 25.8 at New Orleans and 29.9 at Minneapolis show the
improvement in the cotton and flour industries, while those of Bos- j
ton and Philadelphia .show the condition of the footwear and textile
manufacturing lines, and the brilliant exhibit of New York, in the
absence of speculation in Wall street, must be taken as a good
exhibit of the general distributive trade of the country as a whole.
The showing is certainly brilliant. The failures for the week were
216, agaicst 2^7 last year.
While the whole country is sending in very good reports, the
best come from the wheat, corn and cotton States. The iron and
steel regions, however, report new business decreasing and quota
tions declining. Distribution of general merchandise is reported
excellent and increasing everywhere, and the lumber trade ami
building operations are particularly active. There are signs in some
Eastern quarters, though, that buying of real estate is being over
done, but this is not of sufficient magnitude either in volume or area
to occasion apprehension.
Reports from the Pacific Coast are still brilliant. Here crop
prospects as a rule are fine and prices for almost all farm and orchard
staples high. The export trade of this port is making a most ex
cellent showing. During May the exports were $5,075,000. againft
55.758.000 in April and $2,706,000 in May, 1904. Most of this grx>d
business is with China and Japan. For the first eleven months of
the current fiscal year the reports from San Francisco were $58,868.
ooo ? against 544.955.000 during the corresponding period in I^o4,
ami in this master cf general exports this year from San Francisco
1005 is a record breaker. But the city is making great strides in
other directions. Building operations are simply immense. New
sky-scraping ofnee buildings are rising en all sides, while vast areas
of new dwellings are going up. both here and across the bay. The
eye is startled by the extent of these operations, and the question
at once arises : "Where are all the people to occupy these buildings
coming from?"' The answer will probably be found in the reduced
railroad pa&senger rates, which arc bringing into California and San
Francisco homes'eekers by the thqusands. Certainly, the Pacific
Coast cannot complain of dullness in ar.v direction.
ABOUT THE YELLOW PERIL
â â \u25a0-,\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0- - \u25a0!â - - . \u25a0\u25a0 â
r pHE of alarm raised by the press of continental Europe
I concerning the Yellow Peril has for its obvious object th>*
interference of the Western nations in making peace between
Russia and Japan, upon, such terms as will deprive the latter of
the just fruits of her victory. The same nations did this before
at the close of the Chinese-Japanese war.
Japan hal captured Port Arthur and the peninsula and the
coast of Pechili and Liautong gulf?. She was compelled by Europe,
led by Russia and Germany, to relinquish these fVuits of her victory
and take Formosa. Then Germany immediately seized the coast
of the gulf of Pechili and Russia took Port Arthur and the penin
sula. That impertinent interference caused the present war. Now
the same nations are scheming and intriguing to repeat that policy,
and to effect the purpose the Yellow Peril is being exploited.
In some cases the American press falls into" line with the
European papers which are engaged iv the business. â¢ The United
States cannot be a party to the scheme.. If it succeed we may
expect the partition of China to follow and the division of the
empire between our commercial rivals in Europe, to the complete
exdusion of our trade. But justice is higher than the commercial
sentiment. We need to study justice in deafing with Eastern Asia.
Our unfortunate complications over coolie labor have tinged our
view of matters Chinese and Japanese- 7 We are acting entirely
within our national rights when we restrict or entirely exclude
foreign immigration of any* specified class, but Japan is entirely
within her rights when she demands equality in respect of immi
gration with the other powers. We have extended Chinese coolie
regulations to the merchants, bankers, students and scholars of
China, in denial to them of their rights under the treaty and law.
While we do this we insist that our citizens shall, without restric
tion, enjoy in China all of their rights under the same treaty.
Our Supreme Court denies the right of the writ of habeas
corpus to Chinese born here and therefore citizens entitled to all
constitutional rights. Of course, the writ is not "\u25a0 issr.able". to '"-. the=
merchants and excepted classes under the exclusion act, and, the
result is to gravely imperil our trade with China. The Call, con
sistently upholding the exclusion act, has repeatedly pointed our
the consequences of applying coolie regulations to the excepted
classes. It is the very essence of unwisdom, and its fruits are
ripening in the refusal of Chinese merchants to handle our mer
chandise. Those merchants care nothing for the coolies, but they
do care for justice, and their growing determination to trade else
where than here is treated as part of the Yellow Peril by the
sensational press. Common sense is better than uncommon sensa
tionalism. In entering into treaties with China we have conceded
international equality to that empire." Can we expect to exclude
all classes of her people from our soil and still enjoy every privi
lege for all classes of our people upon her soil ? To. do so would
be monstrous, and would put our conduct in 'the same catalogue as
England's war to force opium upon the Chinese. >
It is announced that a railway /concession' from Canton to
Hankow, granted to an American syndicate* headed by J. P.
Morgan, is about to be withdrawn. As this announcement comes
from Berlin, it is to be taken v,'ith caution. Here at home Mr.
Morgan's gold is considered as something of a yellow peril itself/
and the Chinese Government may be acting ; on\what the American
press has said about him. But, granting that his concession is to

be canceled, why should it not be? He depends for his, rights in
the premises - upon the same treaty that is relied upon by the
Chinese merchants and other classes who want to do business v:
this country, but arc treated as ccolies when they make the effort.
There is nothing specially sacred about Mr. Morgan and his con
cession, and he has no treaty rights that do not also belong to
Chinese business men. We cannot eat our cake and keep it. We
cannot deny to the excepted classes of Chinese every one of their
treaty rights and make* China pay indemnities for doing the same
thing to Americans.
Now, the A'eiknv Peril that is keeping continental Europe
awake nights consists in the fact that Japan has fought her way
to the hegemony of Eastern Asia and has the power to enforce
equality of treatment by the Western nations. That is all. The
men who talk sbout an aggressive military movement against the
Occidental world know that \u25a0their- talk is foolish. It may excite
the shallow and thoughtless, but men cf sense know that the road
to peaceful expansion of our commerce with Eastern Asia lies in
doing* justice and in keeping our treaty covenams. When the
Boxer revolution put treaty, keeping out of the power of China,
the cdhecrted nations invaded that empire with nYe aiul sword.
But -every" one of them violat&s its treaties with 'China, with .im
punity, because the Chinese have no remedy but passive resistance.
* Their refusal to take our trade i? passive resistance, aad if we
continue \u25a0\u25a0' to â¢â¢ apply ccclie regulations to Chinese merchants, ir.En
darins and bankers, we have no right to complain if such treat
;merit is, passively resented.
The business 'mem of San Francisco have an enormous, stake
in the matter, and should not remain passive while misapplication
of the exclusion act is robbing them ci trade in the Orient.
THE town of Hudd*rsn>ld. England,
which stands in the front rank of
the cities that have adopted the plan
of public utilities owned and controlled
by tbe^nunicipai authorities, has recently
taken a- further step and provided for;
child-rearing under official direction.
Realizing that; a large part of the death
rate among the poor was of infants un- \u25a0

or unintelligent care and nourishment,
the Mayor of the city offered 'a bo^us of

1826, when the English j navigator ] Beechey
sailed into San Francisco . Bay . and jj paid
a visitto the, mission he found the settler
ment by the Laguna de los . Dolores
dilapidated, and sorry and the chapel
thereof rather 'shabby. The exterlor<con
tinued in more or less of a degenerate
state until 1860, when the .Very Rev.
Father Prendergast, then resident priest
of the Mission, caused the walls to be re
stored. It was he who built the weather
board protection ' to the west wall and
who reroof ed the ancient structure with
good tilesj and thus it ; is to -him -San
Francisco is indebted for the preserva
tion of its most precious heirloom.
Now that thousands of Knights of Co
lumbus are to visit the city during the
week it is to be hoped that loyal citizens
will point out to them, and to every vis
itor that cornea among: us, the cradle in
which San Francisco was nurtured, and
that a manifestation of pride in our pre

in the. past.

it was certainly improper for others; to

"And that is not all they did," declares
Miss Helen Ham, who says she is being

"They sat down on the . grass . close be
side some soldier boys who were playing
ball at Fort Baker," said she. "They did
not do anything really wrong, but I do
not think that is just the proper thing
for young ladies to do. Yes, and some of
them made remarks- to passers-by. But
that Isn't all. One. member, and a portly
one at that, leapedâ actually leapedâ
from the ground into the back end of. a
farm wagon drawn by two mules, and In
the wagon were a preacher and two oth
er strangers. Then thirty-five or the
members got a pass and visited the quar
ters at Fort Baker. "When they came out
the passes only called for thirty-four
persons. One of. our number had appro
priated her pass.' With much red tape
the curious problem in arithmetic waa
finally left unsolved and Uncle Sam's
bluecoats allowed us to depart.
Some of the girls liked the Idea of be
ing conspicuous. And when they climbed
gayly up into the top of an uprooted tree
to be photographed they did not care
who saw their. high boots. Those of more
stateliness and avoirdupois declined to
follow the example of their more agile
comrades.
CLIMBED A TREE.
Dear, dear, dear! What should the
young ladies and the old maids and the
spinsters do? . - ;
They passed a farmhouse, and from
the -peak of a r haystack stared *a man;
they looked the 'other way, and more
men; it seemed that they were the cyno
sure of all eyes; from behind every knoll,
every rock and' from 'within* every bush,
like the' picket men at Bunker Hill, the
impertinent men poured their withering
glances.
Every Sunday the 'members take a
tramp, fully equipped in natty qutlng
suits, some wearing , short skirts and
long-topped lace boots. Although man
has been strictly, tabooed from the sacred
precincts of the club, it has been found
to be practically impossible for the fair
ones to go tramping without meeting at
every turn of the road the omnipresent
genus homo. They went to the Cliff
House beach on. their first tramp, and
the horrid men. watched the. vigorous
maidens go In wading. The more timor
ous ones, it is said, did not participate in
this diversion.* They were shocked, some
of them, so they say, at the innocent
audacity of their sister mermaids. The
next time the association, went tramping
Point Bonita wast the objective, but even
in that benighted spot they were unable
to escape the curious gaze of those hor
rid men.
TAKE WEEKLY TRA3IPS.
Charges of unbecoming conduct and ac
tions out of harmony with the spirit, of
the association have already been pre
ferred by the club against two of its"
members, the Misses Helen and Anna
Ham. residing at 1455 CVFarrell street.
The accused ones have been haled to ap
pear f before the board of directors; and
show cause why they should not be ex
pelled from the association. The Misses
Ham indignantly deny that they have
been guilty of any wrongdoing, and have
employed an attorney to represent their
side of the case and, if necessary, seek
complete vindication in the courts. To
offset the charges preferred aganist them
the accused ones declare that they are
being persecuted by a certain clique, of
the younger members, whose own per
sonal conduct at times lia3 been any
thing but proper.
The association, which has been in 1 ex
istence : but three months, now â¢' hag a
membership of 171, and the list is stead
ily growing. They meet in well-equipped
quarters in - the Jefferson square club
house. Across the portals of their club
rooms it is the privilege of no man to
pass. Dr. Mary Holt is the president,
and Miss Claire Donovan, a teacher in
Mills College, is the physical instruct
or. The personnel of the members dif
fers as widely as the north | from the
south, although private character above
reproach is necessary to join.
There is a bitter dissension in the ranks
of the Young Women's Common: Sense
Athletic Association, arising out of a wide
difference of opinion held by' the member
ship on the question of what is the proper
and what the improper thing for the fair
ones to do on their weekly tramps in re
gions where the prying eyes'of man are
attracted \by the jaunty damsels- on

POSTUM CEREAL.
"WHAT A. CRllttÃ'*
To Talk Agmlnat Coffee
To an ambitious student an ailment that
Interferes -with school and study is very
hard to bear.
A bright young girl In Detroit who had
been poisoned by coffee, is now pur-
suing her studies in perfect health. Prob-
ably the coffee champions .feel she should
have continued to suffer and kept on
with the coffee, but now and then tfiere
are self-willed creatures who insist on
getting well by leaving, .off coffee, de-
serting the "topers' ranks" and joining
the Postum army.
'â¢From early childhood till a year ago I
was in the habit of drinking three or
four cups of coffee every day.
"As I grew older, the bad effects began
to show themselves, although I had no
Idea that it was coffee that was doing the
mischief. I became very nervous, and
suffered so much from severe headaches
that I lost much valuable time from my
school and studies. The doctor could
give me no reliefâ he probably did not
suspect the coffee any more than I did.
â¢One day I went to visit a friend, and
the roft>e they had on, their table tasted
so good that I asktd what kind it was,
and. they told me it was Postum Food
Coffee. My friend said that her mother
had Mm a nervous wreck from drinking
the old kind of coffee, but had been re-
->*.tore<l to hfalth by quitting it and drink-
ing- Postum. The whole family were en-
ttrafclaÃtlc about PoFtum and advised me
to try it.
"I cvt g'.ad they did: for it has given
me back my health. 'At Mrst we <lid not
boil it enough and did not like It. but we
soon learned how to make It, and now we
ail prffrr it to the old kind. I have
dsscovÂ«rÂ«l that to stir a beaten egg in
the -xarm milk we use instead of cream
gives a most delicious flavor 'to Postum
Food CoffeÂ£.
"From the first day I began to use
PofMum Coftco (I quit the old kind alto-
gether) my health b<?gan to improve. My
headaches ceased on the third day and
have never returned, my nervousness has
completely disappeared, my brain seems
invigorated and strengthened, and I am
new able to study from 4 to 5 hours
dally, outride of school, and feel no bad
effects from it.
"My aunt' was sick for five years from
coffee poisoning. It was hard work to
g*-t her to give up the beverage, but
when Fhe did and began to use Postum
Food ConVe, she got well almost at once,
and is now enjoying flnt health." Name

. Not one of Dr. Rosen's party- of eight
een was Hi during the expedition. On the
way out of Abyssinia the members of the
party found supplies waiting for them at
every station, as King Menelik told them
they would be. Although it has been said
that". Menelik's authority over the outly
ing districts is not recognized, Dr. Rosen
found the chiefs in the most remote parts
of the, country anxious tocarry out the
King's orders. :
Dr. Rosen says that King Menelik is in
fine : health, and that although he is 62
years of age he looks only about 50. He
is fond of \ wearing, a broad-brimmed
American hat when out of doors, but oth
erwise , he dresses i in the loose garments
of the country. When Indoors the King
wears a large kerchief folded about his
head. ; . ' . /
BERLIN, June 11.â Dr. Rosen, Minister
electto Morocco, has returned from Adis
Ababa, Abyssinia, where he! waa sent as
a, special envoy- of Germany to King
Menelik for the purpose of concluding a
commercial treaty between Abyssinia and
this country. | Dr. * Rosen's personal esti
mate of King Menelik, whose , language
he speaks and whose associate he was
for some weeks, is that he is essentially
a 1 man of sound | morals and excellent
principles, even according to the" Euro
pean I standard, and that in the main he
lives up to those principles.
Dr.\ Rosen says "King Menelik's easy
rure over the feudal district kings and
chiefs is due to his quick mind and mild,
conciliatory disposition, supported by oc
casional severity. 'He .'always keeps his
word, doing what he says he will do, and
Is just to the^traditions of his country.
.King Menelik's own belief, according to
Dr. Rosen, is that he is descended from
a son of Solomon and the Queen of She
ba; that tiÂ«.s son, who was called Prince
Menelik I, with a following of picked
men, Jews and Sabians, went Into Ethio
pia and , lived there,' and. that these Jews
were tht founders of the present' Abyssi
nian Semitic race. Menelik I is pre
sumed to havrf taken tMe . ark of the
covenant wuh him, and It is still assert
ed to be in J a temple, at Okhum. No Eu
ropean has ever seen ;lt, and it has not
been seen even rby the present ruler of
Abyssinia himself. Only priests of high
grade who ; are unmarried are " permitted
to behold it.

wept. At another: point Gordon Bigelow
broke down and this had : a bad effect

he had passed into penitentiary sallyport,
he remarked that it was the first' time he
ever was in prison. .Warden McGloughrey

v Herbert Long and , Clarence Griffin also
played a match that kept lthc # spectators
Interested throughout. Griffin played, ln
his old-time form and after two close sets
was Oeclared the winner. -Long,: as usual,
played much below his practice game.
v Melville Long ' played good tennis when
he beat A. Brabant. .The latter lost by a

The. members of the Golden Gate Ten
nis Club met in a class tournament yes
terday Jon the park courts. The finals
of the third and fourth classes were dis
posed of and the first class waa complet
ed to the semi-finals. G. Querln carried
off the honors: In the third class and W.
L.. Howeli in the fourth. In the first
class the successful; players were: Clar
ence .- Griffin, Harold. Gabriel, George
Baker. and Fred Adams. - .
. Contrary to expectation the lower class
men furnished by far the closest ; and
most Interesting matches. The tennis In
the first /class was considerably better,
but the matches a3.a rule were not close.
This is due to' the fact that the first and
second classes were consolidated.
'. Both final matches required :the full
five sets to settle, the question < of su
premacy., In the fourth class the contest
ants were W. I>. Howeli and M.. Crich
ton. After four sets had been played each
player had exactly the same number *of
games to his'credit, each having won and
lost two sets by scores of 6-2 and 6-4. .In
the fifth and deciding set Crichton looked
almost a sure winner when he led at. 4-1
and again at 5-2. j Howeli was equal to the.
occasion and played a fine uphill game,
pulling out the set by a score of. 7-5. The
complete score was 4-6, 6-2. 2-6, 6-4, 7-5.;
H The third class match was one of the
most peculiar played on . tho courts in
sqme"time. G. L. Hall took the first two
sets with comparative ease and it seemed
he would win In straight sets. ' G. Guerln,
his opponent, kept : right on playing and
try as he' would Hall could not annex an
otheriset. "The last three sets were, re
markably close, air going to 7-5.. In each
set Hall had chance3Uo.,win,,but Guerln
outplayed him when the pinch .came. Hall
probably let up a' trifle after winning the
nrpt two sets. This is j a mistake many
more experienced "players have made and
the match goes to prove :the old .saying
that a tennis matoh Is not over until the
last point has been* played. The score in
Guc-rin's favor was 2-6, 4-6,*7-5, 7-5, 7-5. \u25a0-

SUMMARY.
YV'halrn. shot a. fi-.vift one rig-lit Into
the elsts trt Pinch Kelly and Van waÂ«
fon-fd through. Brick responded with
a drlvo out to N>alon. and during: the
in is up Cook planted his feet on the
rubber. Dunltavy aad Kelly came
t:aurilÂ»r;njr in when Francks soused a
irood ov.(: out to f hort center. In the
fifth Gochnaucr threw Graham's , hit
away into the right Pe!d bleachers,
j;::Â«king- it rive fur the Oaklanders.
t3s<.-ar Graham had another of those.
g-ood days of his which have come- so
often latf-Jy. 'Â£here was. nothing- -the.
i-rrutic left-wringer did not possess. Up
to the ninth spasm the Seals had made
but one bingle off him and tliat vras a
scratchy 'one by Spencer in the Sixth.
Wjildron started Off the ninth with
a drive paf=t short and Wheeler was
there with one 16 right. When Kilde
brand succeeded in making good. with
a base on balls, the fans were ready
to jump off the highest bleachers. .It
was all changed to sadness in a trice ;
when Byrnes caught Wheeler napping
oft second and Irwin struck out and '
Hildebrand was whipped out a block
trying to steal second.
Johnny Gochnauer had to quit the
game In the seventh Inning. This
evening: he will undergo an" operation
for the removal of a part of his right
Jaw. Ke was hit In the head by a
batted ball last year and the wound
never healed. The great little short
ptop will not be able to hook any more
fast grounders for several weeks. The

Had Jimmy Whalen been able td
stall through that first inning the fin
ish would possibly have differed a lit
tle. Disaster came thick and with
force when it did arrive and four runs
were whisked through so fast the fans
hardly realized what was b*lng done
till the bunob. of runs arrived.
Old Rip Va.ii Haltren planted one out
to deep center for three cushions as a
v.arm*r tip.- Cook beat an inneld hit
and Dunleavy accepted a pass from The
Whale. Strefb lifted one to Spencer,
who. made a great ono-h;>.nd ratch and
held Van at third, thus making it look
bÂ»t!Â«r for Uncle* ac two had been de
i L;r<*d out.
It was too bad Uncles winning com
bination faded at the eleventh hour,
tor had fate been a bit more lenient the
Peals would hayÂ« chafed the Commut

SANTA CRUZ, Jimeil.â The members
of the California Automobile Club have
been having a delightful time as the day
has. been V perfect one and Ideal for thÂ«
many side j trips.- There was no special
programme in regard to runs, but all day
parties have been leaving the headquar
ters at the Sea Beach Hotel for the fa
mous cliff drive. A favorite resort was to
the new fish hatchery at Brookdaid.
Many went to Felton," -Tuxedo, the
Big Trees, Ben Lomond and - Boulder
Creek up the San Lorenzo Canyon and
enjoyed a luncheon in" the woods! Short
runs were taken to . Capitola, Laveaga
Heights and" tne heights surrounding the
city. There was plenty of entertainment
provided for the guests at the Sea Beach,
where the Royal Hawaiian Orchestra
gave a concert.. . ... ., -â¢ .
-At the : Casino a, biff programme was
given. ' Bennett's Band gave an open air
concert this morning from It to 12 .and
also this afternoon. The plunge and surf
were : also eagerly sought, as were the
launches on the bay. At night there were
illuminations of the Casino, the. electric
pier and the esplanade, a concert by Ben
nett's Band and a display. of fireworks,
closing with a concert on the roof garden
by the Royal Hawaiian Orchestra.
The purple of the Elks who are here
from San Francisco was conspicuous and
they shared in the festivities. A number
of the automoblfists are to remain over
until to-morrow. Many returned"' home
to-day, leaving in the morning in order to
enjoy their luncheon on the way-home.
The favorite way of return was over the
mountains via Hotel de Redwood. Some
took the coast ride via Pescadero, Halt
moon Bay and Colma along the route of
the proposed ocean shore -railroad.* A
few went by way of Watsonvllle, San
Juan and Gllroy. The verdict of all is
that the run was the most successful in
the history of the club.

Lieutenant; Price's delay in sending a
man on the case, and says he will com
plain to Chief Dinan.
Detective "William Harrison, to whom
many clever catches are credited, is in
charge of the case.. The hold-up is at
tributed to aya v gang of young thugs who
have committed â¢ many ' depredations of
late In the Mission.
Lieutenant Price ,of '.the' Mission sta
tion was given immediate information as
to the whereabouts of the robbers, but
he refused to allow Detective Harrison to
go out on the case until some original in
vestigations were made. Harrison, who
knows ' the district well, had a clew but
Price held him twenty minutes while ho
lectured one of his men for an infraction
of a police rule. \. . ,
