â¢FEW DAYS RE3IAIN

Aloof While : Son Lies
Dying in Seattle.
SEATTLE, Sept. J.â A wire received to
night by Mrs. Nicholas . T. Luning from
her stepfather. Lawyer Button of Oak
land, states that he and Mrs; Button have
started for 4 Seattle to attend the bedside
of their son-In-iaw. Not a line has been
received from the boy's millionaire father
in San Erancisco.
Lying in his little boarding-house room
the boy's Tace, is blanched and his voice
has been subdued to a whisper. Plainly
he is worrying over the refusal of his
father, to send him at least some word of
encouragement. That young Luning" s
days are numbered is the general opinion
of all who have visited the sick chamber,
where friends are in constant attendance,
helping the ! faithful little wife, who Js
grieving at the health \of the boy, who
gave up his all for her."
There will be no appeal from Luning to
his father. All hope of a reconciliation
has passed since no word came on , the
anniversary of the boy's marriage a few
weeks ago. - â¢

PORTSMOUTH, Sept. I.â An armfstice
has uecn .signed, to take effect after
taÂ«r* signing of the treaty. The delay
in the cessation of hostilities was due
to the refusal of Japan to consent to an
farlier time.
The . effect of the armistice is that
it b'efconjei . operative only upon the
*iguing'of 'the treaty by' the envpys
and continues until the'nnal exchange
of ratifications by. the Emperors of the
two countries. It is for "this reason
that the plenipotentiaries, who will
themselves convey to their respective
capitals the .momentous documents,
wnicn-lo become binding must repeive
the signatures of their respective Em
perors, are "anxious to leave "at the
earliest'poesible date, foregoing the in
numerable invitations, which have been
â¢showered! upon them.

vitation" on behalf of the State of New
Hampshire to attend the banquet* which
is to be tendered by that *Stato to the
peace envoys of Russia and Japan. \ The
banquet probably will be held. at the
Mount Washington, House In the White
Mountains.
Ttte invitation was extended person
ally â¢ by Senator Â«Burnhara of> New
Hampshire and Georg-e It Moses, gec
retary to Governor McLanc of "that
State, who arrived here Ao-day,to make
an appeal to tfte President to partici
pate in the function. Senator Burnbam
elready had â¢ been informed, by . the
President that he would be unable to
po* to New Hampshire this month, but
it was decided to make to him this
personal appeal to change his mind. -
Discussing: the situation at Ports
mouth, Senator Burnham said:
It i* recognized generally, at Portsmouth
that if Jt had not fceea for President Roosev-'lt
the petce conference would have if-rcnlnatid

accorded the glory of ending the war and
brinsrins about peace. He Ik one of the most

Assured that the President could not
go to Portsmouth or to the White
Mountains as the people of New Hamp
shire had hoped he rrlsit. be able to do.
Senator Burn ham and Mr. Moses dis
cussed with the President the criticism
which recently hud been made on the
entertainment of the conferrees In Ports

everything possible, bad been 7 done by
the officials of the State. The people of
Portsmouth also did all . possible to

as possible. They said to the President'
that , th ere \u25a0was ' no foundation - whatever

and that the. pltolpotentiaries* them

The city of Portsmouth was selected
by the President himself as the seat of.
thÂ« conference .because of its excellent
facilities. In the way of entertainment
and for the further reason that the ses
"sions of the conference could be held
at the navy yard, where tho envoys
would be free from interruption. It
had been expected by the officials of
Xew Hampshire that tho sessions of the
conference would be held in the White
â¢Mountains and originally there. was no
intention that they should be hold at
Portsmouth. President Roosevelt's de
cision as to the holding of the confer

acquiesced. in gladly. President Roose

PRAISE FOR ROOSEVELT.
Kniili*!i Papers Co mm end Him for Hl*
"'Â»;. ;v.l Shore In Penc* Xearotlatlons.
LONDON. Sept. Lâ The result of the
Portsmouth conference is discussed at
great length by ths London weekly pub
lications, the consensus of opinion' being
that expressed by the Outlook, which
says: \. ;\ '^:.:> \u25a0 â¢
"In the matter of indemnity Japan
yielded to Inexorable conditions; in the
matter of Saghalien she allowed herself
to be outgeneraled."
At the same time the general opinion is
that in yielding half of Saghalien Japan
may fairly be credited with excellent po
litical foresight, which will not be recog
nized at once by the mass of Japanese.
Like the daily newspapers, the reviews,
even those which seldom lose an oppor
tunity to express anti-American or anti-
Roosevelt opinions, give the President un
stinted .praise for his chare in the nego
tiations. The Speaker, an organ of the
Liberal party, says:
"Those who. like ourselves, always mis
trusted President Roosevelt's policy and
blamed- him for certain defects, yielded
to none in recognizing the great service
he has rendered the world, to the grati
tude to which he is entitled. It is to his
initiative, untiring energy and refusal to
despair of the successful outcome of the
conference that peace is largely due."
The Outlook -*ays:
"For this achievement President Roose
velt has received the gratitude and ad
miration of the rulers and peoples of the
worlu in overflowing measure. Such
piaise has never before been lavished on
an American President. Both for himself
and his country President Roosevelt has
won- a position of unique and command
ing authority."
In connection with a;diÂ»cussion of the
future effect' of the peace terms, which
all the weekly papers agree must mean
an entire Teallgnment of Europe; the
Anglo-Japanese treaty is given consider
able space and Is credited with being the
preponderating Influence in securing the
agreement at Portsmouth. â¢
The Speaker criticizes, the clause of the
new treaty which binds either country to
help the other in case of attack by a
third, because "for the present the. best
guarantee against the aggression of Euro
pean powers in the Far East is the un
disputed predominance of Japan, and that
guarantee is weakened by an arrange
ment which puts' peace In the Far East
at the mercy of quite irrelevant quarrels
elsewhere.
"We are," the paper says, "in close re
lations? with Europe in general and in in
timate' relations-wlth France in particu
lar. To confuse those relations by a bind
ing promise to make war on any nation
with which this vigorous and competent
people, just launching its fortunes on a
career of generous ambition, majr quarrel
seems to us a grave indiscretion. '
Otherwise the reviews, while not in
possession of the full terms of the new
agreement, accept the treaty as outlined
by the press in its main particulars as a
wise extension of the former alliance and
as a strong guarantee of the lasttng peace
of the world.
\u25a0 JAPANESE PRESS AROUSED.
Xewapnpcm Protest Against the Term*
of Peace Made by the Envoy*.
TOKIO. Sept. I.â Premier Katsura
and Marquis Ito have received numer
ous -protests and memorials appealing
against the terms of peace as pub
lished In the newspapers. It is pos
silile that the Japanese plenipotentia
ries will publish a statement at Ports
mouth on the conclusion of their la
bors. The Foreign Office intimates that
nothing will be published here until a
signed copy of the treaty has reached
the Emperor for his approval. It will
probably be gazetted about a month
hence.
Baron Komura may make a personal
Â«ta'tement to the Diet explaining the
proceedings at the conference.
Yuruzu, an independent radical or
gan, attacks the Portsmouth settle
ment, commencing its article, "Arise,
brethren." Then recalling the attempt
to assassinate Count Komura, it says.
"People will never remain quiet when
national interests are menaced."
The newspaper affirms that the na
tion will be humiliated unless the peo
ple .take strong action. 'It asks why
the. victors are conciliatory and the
vanquished arrogant. It declares that
a speedy intervention of the people
alone* wijl prevent a national disgrace
following a brilliant victory by land
and' sea. "it continues. "If 'such inter
vention'does not cpme our brother's
killed ou the field will have died an
inglorious "death."
The minor papers generally express
anger and denounce peace as hu
miliating.

Famous Sculptor
Kills Wife for
Unfeithf illness
FAMOUS ITALIAN SCULPTOR WHO -
KILLED , Hrs *TVIFE "WHEN HE
FOUND HER 'FAITHLESS. .
ROME, Sept., 1.-Seldom j has. all ; Italy
been so stupefied by. a tragic event as this
country Is at present over the murder of
his wife by Fllippo ; Cifariello, \u25a0 the sculp
tor.; Cifariello,;. who Is one of the-fore
most men of his line In Italy, has been
rising v steadily . for years, but recently
reached the zenith of his" career when he
executed the monument to King Humbert
unveiled at BarFby the present King of
Italy.. The striking qualities of the work
aroused intense enthusiasm. The King
personally ; congratulated the sculptor,
who was - carried'- shoulder high by the
crowd amid ringing '.cheers. It is prob
able, â¢ however, [ that : his . hour of triumph
was poisoned to its hero by the domestic
bitterness which ;hjis ruined his life for
so many, years and .which has now ended
in a shocking tragedy.
Cifariello shot his wife, who had been
unfaithful to him, /it the Pension Mas
cotte, situated at Posilippo, the famous
suburb of Naples, which Is the center of
one of the most beautiful regions in the
world. Signora Cifariello, "who was pos
sesed of rare beauty, was a singer in a
French cafe "concert at the time when the
Italian sculptor fell in love with and mar
ried her. "That wad twelve years ago.
Cifariello was passionately in love with
his wife, whose maiden name was Marie
de Brahon, and a portrait bust which he
made of her is one of his finest works.
Infidelity after infidelity, however, was
committed by Signora Cifariello, the af
fair which -led : her to kill her
having been with one of the sculptor's in
timate friends.
Cifarleilo had his suspicions for some
time, which, had grown more, definite
within the last fortnight, at the begin
ning of which he left. Rome, .where he has
his studio, and went .'for a holiday to the
Pension Mascotte, near Naples. There he
was joined by his wife almost immediate
ly. â¢ A jfew days . later, Cifa
riello went on . to the Vesuvius Hermitage
â¢for a few. days, when ; his wife remained
behind, for the express purpose it ia- be
lieved of carrying Ton , the intrigue In
which she was engaged. Cifarleilo, how
ever, returned unexpectedly and surprised
the pair together. ;An angry scene- fol
lowed,, af ten which, the lover fled to
Rome. Signora Cifariello vowed to fol
low him by the earliest train next morn
ing, and in th^meanwhile bought a small
revolver. At !$ o'clock in the morning
several pistol .shots were heard in % the
room occupied in the ' Pension Mascotte
by the 'sculptor and his -wife, and when
the \u25a0; door was. forced ; the ..woman was
found, dead, with' three bullets wounds in
her \u25a0 breast and one in her arm. At ' her
feet was the. small revolver . she .had
bought, of. which, however, all the cham
bers were loaded, and'farther oft lay an
other,' with which the deed had been com
mitted. Signor Cifariello |in a frÂ«nzy was
calling for medical aid and declaring that
it was he who had shot his wife.
. "But she wished it,',' he said. "She
forced me to doit.":
On , learning that his wife was dead the
sculptor; made for the window, with the
intention of flinging himself out, but was
seized by j, the hotel servants and held un
til the appearance of the police.

CHINESE TALKS OX EXCLUSION.
Nr Poon Chew 'Lecture* Before the
Academy of Science*.
Ng Poon Chew, managing editor of
the Chung Sai YatPo, gave a lecture
on Chinese exclusion and its results
before the Academy of Sciences last
evening. Mr. Chew, is considered the
best Chinese speaker on the Pacific
Coast and has lectured in some of the
largest cities in the United States, He
came from China wh^en 14 years of age
and after a common school course at San
iJose he came to San Francisco, where he
graduated from a theological seminary
and was ordained a minister of tho gos
pel in 1!i92. In 1900 he resigned from
the ministry to accept his present po
sition. â¢ - , ; .. \
In the course, of -his remarks, the
editor said: .',.\u25a0_
There was a time in the history of China
when she was alt sufficient unio herself; she
had no desire to mingle with the rest of trÂ»o
world, politically -or socially. It was the
western nations that . compelled China to get
out of her seclusion. The , United V States _
urgently entreated the ! Cheese to migrate to
this country because .there was much work
that needed their . service. .. At first the pres
ence of the Chinese In* this land was favored,,
but when the overland railroad was Dalit
thousands \u25a0 upon thousands of foreigners came
over from Europe. After that favorable senti
ment toward - the Chinese â¢ was . transf ormtd
into bitter opposition. -Through this anti-
Chinese agitation resulted the unreasonable
Chinese exclusion laws. '?.":'*', ' _Z~~
\u25a0 The whole history of I the â¢ anti-Chinese agita
tion, when reduced '-to ' a" cognisable- point,
amounts to nothing more 'or less 'than the op
pression of one set of foreigners without votes
by a set of foreigners with the voting power.
And all the Chinese exclusion laws were en
acted for a political purpose. The real title of
every anti-Chinese law should read like this:
"An act to \u25a0 provide . ways and means to pro.
cure the Pacific Coast votes." â¢
The Chinese exclusion principle was rounded
upon two false theoriesâ namely, that of pro
tection of American institutions and protection
of American labor. ' \u25a0 < â¢
It Is shamelessly and blindly asserted that
the presence of the Chinese In this country
is harmful to American Institutions, morality
and religion. But American Institutions are
not built on sand or paper,' ready to crumble
to dust by the mere touch of the Chinese. No
one would believe for a , moment , that the
eighty million brave, \u25a0 educated citizens of; the
first nation on earth ' are in danger of betrg
contaminated by the presence of the 70.C00
inoffensive, unassuming Chinese. . No one
would entertain such -an Idea' except a man
with a fevered- brain.
People bear bo much about the unasÂ«imilat!ns
quality of the Â»Chinese r that they 'take It for
granted as a fact. But the real fact la- that
it is not we Chinese who do not -want to
assimilate: . the Americans have done : every
thing in their power to prevent us from assim
ilating. Your society, your clubs, your unions
close their doors against us. You . passed laws
to prevent us from becoming citizens; you have
enacted a law to â¢ f orbld us marrying your
daughters ; and also from bringing our women
from China, and yet you blame us for not
settling down here and, helping you solve the
race- suicide' . question. .How* unreasonable!
This is Just like breaking a fellow* Â» leg and
kicking him for- not moving fast enough to
cult you. \u25a0 ' '-'*â¢"* \u25a0- ' ' "' '' '
â¢ Anu It Is also charged that we send money
out of - the country. We send very little com
pared with that which goes annually to Eu
rere. "We never ' send \ any money from - the
country In' the term; of coins, only in the
form of value â and that In the form of goods.'
Now, by sending goods from the â¢ country a
fteld is created -\u25a0 for more white labor. And
besides, for every dollar we receive we give in
return a full dollar's" value in Jabor. \u25a0 What
money we take. -.we take only; as the price of
labor, but we leave the product r of our labor
in the country. : People ' should not be scared
at China's population of 400,000,000. In spite
of this" figure China. is not so thickly peopled
as Euro I* . â¢ ~^&BraSÂ£l>33&S3HÂ£&Â£%^bÂ£g!3^
The ' free lmmlzration of Chinese to thiÂ«
country, should not cauw alarm. They never
come in any thins like the ' numbers > that an
nually, pour into â¢ the : country - from Europe.
From 1848 .to ISS2. - a ' period of thirty-four
years of IrÂ«e Chinese immigration, the largest
number of Chinese In ' this country was
106,000. ' â¢â¢- -.â¢-â¢:\u25a0 . \u25a0 â¢: \u25a0\u25a0'. \u25a0 ! -
' l*he history of Chinese exclusion for the last
twenty - years has . not proved beneficial .to
American labor interests. -â¢ .
In the shoe, cigar, clothing and woolen in
dustries, where â¢ the -Chinese , were " employed
largely, and freely before the exclusion â¢ act.
after twenty years of exclusion the number of
Chinese - employed In the same Industries has
been ' reduced -to almost nil. . But at the same
time the output was also reduced in' the same
ration and the number of .whites employes cor

TO CONSIDER PLANS FOR
THE ISTHMIAN CANAL.
Consulting En
gineers Hold
Meeting.
Advisory Board
Assembles at
Washington.
Sea Level Prob
lem Is to Be
Taken JJp.
WASHINGTON, Sept. I.â A notable
board of distinguished engineers as
sembled in Washington to-day upon the
request of President Roosevelt to deter
mine the" relative feasibility of^a sea level
or lock canal in the division of the Am
erican continent at the Isthmus of Pana
ma. Constituting the consulting board of
engineers for the canal plan, these men,
gathered from both America and Europe,
were picked from among those foremost in
their profession. The first of the meet
ings at which they will grapple with the
great problem began this morning in a
small room at the office building of the
Isthmian Canal Commission. The pro
ceedings were opened by the reading of
the letter of the President calling them
together, and a letter from Chairman
Shonts of the commission, | which gives
in detail the purpose for which the engi
neers are' convened. . In the President's
order it Is called the "consulting board
of engineers,"* but the letter of Chairman
Shonts is addressed to the "advisory
board of engineers on plans for the
Panama Canal." The letter in .part says:
In accordance with the directions of the
President dated April 1, i 905, the Isthmian
Canal Commission has the honor to lay before
you physical data concerning the Isthmus of
Panama and to solicit your opinion as to the
best plan to be followed In the completion
of the Panama Canal wkmn reasonable limits
of cost and time.
A COMPLEX SUBJECT.
Ab you are aware, this question has beer
the subject of prolonged and elaborate studies
for many years by numerous able engineers.
A vast amount of labor has been expended In
tho collection of Information concerning: the
physics of the Isthmus and digesting: It and
formulating It Into plans lor a canal.
" During the last year additional surveys and
obeervatlons have been mace on the Isthmus,
the result of which is laid before you. It may
be stated here in general terms that the in
formation which they furnish does not involvo
any radical' change in the plans previously
favored. Among: the observations alluded
to, to be included -in the expense of
the last year. Is tMfe excavating for
the Culebra cut, from. which come
of our engineers have drawn unwarranted con
clusions as to the probable cost of the work.
There is nothing In this -experience to Justify
the belief that, the unit prices used in previous
estimates were too high or that the estimate
of thÂ« time required for completing the* work
was too liberal. Nevertheless the acceptance
has been used as an argument In favor of . a
tea level canal, which plan had been con
demned by the two commissions mentioned
above. It becomes necessary to consider once
more the'eea level canal scheme.
ADOPTED BY CONGRESS.
â¢ The- plan . discussed In the ; first pamphlet
(which is submitted amons other papers) is
the cne which was adopted by Congress â at
least by inferenceâ in the act approved June
2S, 1602. It is the plan under which the work
Is now progressing and under which all work
of construction has been done since the United
Etates acquired the property. It closely re
sembles the plans of . the comlte technique,
described in the second pamphlet. In many
essential particulars, but differs from it in the
height of the Bohlo dam and the important
results wljich flow therefrom. The advantages
\u25a0which Its authors expect to derive from this
change are:
Firstâ To take fuller advantage of the topo
graphy of the country, by which it was possible
to make the gigante spillway automatic in
stead of mechanical and adequate for the dis
charge of the greatest ftood.s, with only one
channel to the sea 'instead of two.
Second â To "increase tne distance of lakfl
navigation from seven to nearly thirteen miles.
Third â To reduce the estimated cost of the
canal by about $15,000,000.
The disadvantage of the cnange ia the some
what greater difficulties xn constructing the
higher dam, -and the locks of greater lift â dif
ficulties, however. . which are by no means
Insuperable.
DIFFICULT TO DETEH3IIXE.
A disadvantage which the two plans hare
In -common is that rapid developments of naval
architecture made It difficult to determine the
proper dimensions of the lock chambers. It
is to be considered, however, that up to the
present time eucb development hae not been
greatly' hampered by deficient depth In the
harbors of the world, and that development
hereafter will have that obstruction to contend
\u25a0with. Moreover, It is not possible to dispense
with locks entirely. Even with the sea level
canal a tide lock will be required at the
Panama, end.
In addition to -the plan above mentioned, a
pamphlet has been prepared by London with
dates, which fives in. outline a sketch of a.
plan proposed by him which is interesting on
account of its novelty and . Is therefore laid
before you. It does not \u25a0 give detail enough
for a close analysis, nor for estimates of cost.
To obtain this, -extensive additional surveys,
â¢to occutiy at least a' year's time, would be
necessary.
â¢ A -oaD^r has been submitted to the presi
dent by P. Bunau-Varilla which explains a
\u25a0method by which a canal constructed at the
first with .locks may be subsequently altered
to a sea level canal. This pa->er also is sub
mitted for your consideration.
.Shonts at this point calls attention to
that portion of the act of Congress "which
prescribes the physical features- of 'the
proposed canal and directs that the work
already begun shall be utilized as far as
possible. ' He "concludes his letter as fol
lows: â¢ ' ;r.; r. -X â¢ . .
The commission expects to visit the Isthmus
of Panama, Bailing from New York during the
last "week in September, the exact date to be
fixed hereafter. You' are cordially Invited
to accompany them. . .
WELL-DIGESTED PLANS.
. This method of presenting the subject to
you by offering several well-digested plan* has
been adested -because It seemed to be : the
method by which all essential â¢ Information
.could be conveyed in the most condensed pos
s"H}le form. It is needless to say, that the
commission desired your opinion not only upon
these plans 'but upon any variation of them
or upon Â«ny entirely different plan which may
suggest Itself to you. U requests your viewo
as to what plan is most expedient, all things
considered, for the United States 'to follow
in the construction of the Panama canal. -
; >The afternoon session was spent
largely in discussing the place of hold
ing the ees'sions of the board. A num
ber were in favor of ; New,
York, but others declared, in. favor of
Washington* and Jt was determined that
the meeting should be held in this -city.'
A suggestion was made that the ses
sion should , be public, but 'this
was -decided In the negative.. An execu
tive- committee, consisting of Messrs.
David,. Burr; and Parsons, was created
<o have charge of the general aftilrs of
tne board. The meeting adjourned un
til 11 o'clock to-morrow morning/
Chairman Shonts entertained the:mem
bers of the board- and the -Isthmian
Commission at dinner to-night 'at the
Chevy Chase Club. V-,

British Government; Herr Eugene Tin
causer.'nominated by the German Gov
ernment; M. Guerard, nominated by the
French Government, and J. W. Welcker,
rominated by the Government of The
Netherlands.
The executive work of the Canal Com
mission has been much simplified by
the selection of Mr. Stevens as chief
engineer. Previous"" to that time* the
duties of the commission, as an execu
tive body .were . distributed between
Chairman Shonts,' Chief Engineer Wal
lace and Governor Magoon, Chairman
Shonts having a general -supervision of
the work. Wallace .was a member of
the commission, but' when John' F.
Stevens was made his successor as chief
engineer he was not made a member
of the commission, but was employed
by Shonts, and the engineering and
construction work is under his direction
instead of the general supervision of
Chairman Shonts. Chief Engineer
Stevens is not a member of the execu
tive board of the commission. .
PANAMA, Sept 1. â Carl Strom, chief
of the mechanical department . in . the
canal zone, resigned to-day. It is re
ported that several changes will soon
be made among the officials of the Pan

Luther Burbank among- his cultured
plants and fadeless blooms. They walked
and talked with the ; genius .who . through
his flower beds is making strange paths
for nature herself. '-\u25a0 *"" : i : .
Accepting :the '-.cordial invitation of Bur
bank, somfe thirty members of ths* society
came up . from San Francisco and were |
received by. the \u25a0 premier' scientist at his \
home here. The coming "of these mem-;
bers of the society brought to Santa Rosa
one of the most notable gatherings of
scientific men that has ever assembled
within its confines. In "the assemblage \
were men who are? eminent "in ahthropo- \
logical research; men .who have attained
great eminence In that/science, men who j
are instructors of anthropology in lead- \
ing universities. They came to learn from';
the Santa Rosan.'and that they did learn;
many wonderful things . from him during j
their visit was- plainly discernible.
Burbank met them ; in the beautiful
grounds and. amid the noble Shasta
daisies, the everlasting . star-flowers and
the new crimson poppy he told them. of.
the things he has ' done. . They caught
their breaths when he said he had devel
'opd 200 species of plums. They, rubbed,
their hands over "the velvety surface of ;
the spineless cactus growing alongside its
brother of, a. million needles. The flower;
creator gave them rare blossoms, within J
-whose brilliant chalices 'lie pollen worth,
more than anything on earth. He showed
them the grasses he had grown from
bunches in its original height of a few
inches to mammoth, clusters five hundred
times larger. He led them from beds of
improved grasses that grow in old Nippon
to cultured specimens originally grown
by CecU Rhodes in his South African em
"To meet Burbank," said President Put
nam of the society, "is something tÂ» re
member, but when I think of what he has
done, what he is doing, I feel that his
time is not for visitors. It is no one
man's; it is not even his own; it is the

STRANGE SEQUEL
TO KIDNAPING
Unknown $lan Tells Mother
He Knows Whereabouts of
Girl Stolen Years Ago
SHOWS EECENT PHOTO
Woman's Plea for Informa
tion Is Disregarded and
the Stranger Disappears
NEW' YORK, Sept. I.â ThereK has been
a strange "sequel : to -the mysterious kid
naping; nine years ago of pretty Roste
Cohen, , an '[ East , Side ' girl. The girl's
mother 11 yea on Orchard street, and was
surprised yesterday by the visit of an
unknown man, who. called the mother to
the. door and- after * telling - her he knew
the present whereabouts of the daughter
thrust -\u25a0 a recent photograph -of the girl
Into -.-her hands, and" with the remark,
"She has changed, her name: it is no use
for you to try to find her," disappeared.
In ' the winter of lS9t> ' the girl, nearly 5
years old, '; was playing on the street In
front of her. home when a " man was seen
to : creep up. place 'his hand over the
child's mouth, ctrught her up in his arms
and fled. The police. worked on the case
for a lone time, , without success. The
mother was. heartbroken and gave up
hope of ever knowing her child's ; fate.
When -the man visited Mrs. Cohen yes
teiday she pleaded with him for. knowl
edge of the girl's whereabouts, but he re
fused; "She would not be happy here," lÂ»e
"said. "She is doing air right and has for
gollen you. â¢ She has changed j her name.
Now, just forget her and don't try to find
her. It won't do you any good."
The police were at once notified : and
are inclined to . believe that the man,
having found the mother. Intends de
manding a ransom.
NORWEGIAN FRONTIER
FORTS TO BE SPARED
It Is Expected That Nego
tiations With Sweden Will
End in Agreement.
COPENHAGEN. Sept. 1.-It is expected
that the negotiations between Norway
and Sweden will, soon result in a full
agreement on the subject of the dissolu
tion of the union." Well-informed persons
presume that " Sweden will give up her
claim for the raxing of the fortresses on
the Norwegian frontier, being satisfied
the forts are . not \u25a0 armed. The 1 Swedish
court favors the candidacy , of Prince
Charles of Sweden for the Norwegian
throne, r but it is not certain that the
Riksdag will accept the Norwegian offer
of 700.000 crowns yearly as an allowance
for the eventual King.

threshed out in the court of Police Judge
â¢ .Fritz, ;, . '.^.Y-^
â¢ . Sacral persons testified- that at the
â¢ time of the ipcident mentioned in the
complaint they heard a gunshot and im
mediately; afterward Eaw smoke thinly
escending from the Inclosed backyard of
Jlrs. Gray's cottage on the 700 block of
Andereon ttreeU.Bernal Heights, but not
- . one of them caw Mrs. Gray pull a trigger
â¢ and thiÃ ver>' first that any of them heard
â¢of Mrs. Hempler having been fired at was
when-* that la.<iy herself so asseverated.
, *â¢â¢ To further embarrass the bench. It was
thoiyn that aknough a wooden \u25a0 fence
. e!ght- feet in height divided Mrs. Gray
,'afta ."Mrs. Hempler when the complained
'of -tttieinpt to\kill was made, the struc
- tiire was not.' perforated. And to the
â¢ fprtber confusion of the â¢ court, it was
sworn Â£hat no firearm was found in Mrs.
â¢ Gray's domicife by. the policeman who
searched* it. But the # depth of bewllder
-'ase:Tt> 'was "attained by the . Judge when
Mrs.'Hcmpler Informed him that she did

ivÂ« ::( consisted of a pistol or a rifle. or
. a fhoigwn or a mortar. or'a torpedo tube.
â¢ Stic, was : tos frightened, she explained, to

- | "Did rou expect her to shower you with
. /honeyed phrases after you had., tried to

: Then . the two lawyers engaged in a
tilt that the â¢ bench suppressed after
whiÂ£h It. was disclosed- that Mrs. Gray's
â¢ probable provocation for her alleged

Mrs. Nellie Deventhal, who shot and
slightly* wounded her husband a 'few
days ago And pleaded Intense admira
tion^of him as the Impaling cause of
heY pistol play, displayed calm, not to
say subdued, demeanor while Judge
' Slogan was hearing her attorney's re
â¢ quest that ball be accepted. Her man
ner was in* wide* contrast to the emo
tionalism she exhibited during her ar
raignment, when she wildly implored
her spouse to refrain from prosecuting
her, for she meekly listened to her
counsel's argument, and when the
Judge manifested -reluctance to restore
her to liberty she smiled sadly and
raid: "I- have calmed down since my ar
rest, and do not Intend to do anything
â¢wrong."
But the man whose life she had at
tempted to destroy was palpably afraid
that It afforded opportunity she would I
I renew that attempt. "I'd rather she
didn't* g_et out on ball," he muttered
om!nous)y. "for It'll be too late after
, it's done." By which he probably
meant to Inform the court that he did
not regard bet placidity of temper as
enduring.
However," her bail was fixed at $1000
.and her preliminary examination Bet
for next Wednesday.
S3 loudly did Mrs. Emma Pell and
"Jimmy" Lawler, ex-pugilist, berate
eÂ£tb other in the corridor of Judge Mo
gan's court that the unseemly noise
penetrated tlie tribunal and caused a
stampede of- the curious chair warm
erc, with the result that the woman
* tias arrested and booked for peace dis
turbance and a warrant was issued for
â¢tlift man's arrest on the same charge.
"He cav.lt ;ne nems vod vasn'c 1 nia.ee.

â¢ "Such exchanges of oral filth, may
be commonplace in the tenderloin," said
* the "but outside the bounds of

: blulldins they are reprehensible. - I
phall endeavor to impress that fact
upon your mind and that of "Mr. Lawler

infatuated, and- after the case was con
tinued the complainant was met In the
corridor by L>awler. who .scolded her for
refusing to withdraw her accusation.
Bystanders allege that " not only did
Mrs. Pell "hand back", to her opponent
all tho foul epithets he addressed to
her, but bestowed upon him certain pic
turesque and absolutely unprintable ap
pellations of her own coinage. She
dwells on 'the second block of Taylor
street. - - '.
William Danielson, charged with having
failed to provide for the maintenance of
his wife and four Email. children, was ter
ror personified when Judge Mogan order
ed a bailiff to "put him In the dock.
"For God's sake, don't "do it!" he Im
plored the bench. "I'll do. anything you
say If you don't send me to jail."
His wife, Margaret, also seemed appall
ed by. the prospect of his incarceration,
and it was her state of mind that evident
ly caused the Judge to relent and place
him en the sentence list instead of among
.the prisoners.
Danlelson is a house painter and his
family lives at 10 Lapldge street. To
the best of his wife's knowledge and be
lief there has been no v other woman in
the case, although he is just as much, or
as little, of an Adonis as George Reeves,
hereinbefore mentioned.
James F.Fltzpatrick, famed as "The
Gentleman Burglar," proved an alibi and
thereby obtained dismissal. by Judge Con
lan on the charge that on June 24 he
stole $70 from the office of Antonio De
voto, coal merchant, at 2407 California
street. The defendant's wife and Mrs.
Margaret McDonald and her daughter
Grace 6wore positively that at the time
of the alleged robbery he was at his
â¢home. But he has been convicted on
another burglary charge and awaits sen
tence for it by Superior Judge Cook.
It seemed as if Quongr "Wing blun
dered when he summoned the lady in
mates of the apartment house to testify
in his behalf, for'as one woman they
averred that his conduct was such
that it plunged some of them Into
hysterics and scared -others so badly
that they will never forget It until
their respective dying. days. ..V -V
The apartment house is on the 400 block
of Grove street, and Quong Wing's object
in visiting: it was to endeavor to collect
from Emiel C. Deshener a sum of. $3 al
leged to be owing and overdue for wash
ing and ironing of the Deshener linen.
Mr. Deshener told Quong Wing to call
again, but Quong, Wing declined and inti
mated that Mr. Deshener's purpose was
to defraud him, whereupon Mr. Deshener
advanced as if to eject Quong Wing from
the chamber, which movement Quong
Wing met by standing his ground and
thrusting his right hand behind him. said
gesture being traditionally suggestive of
intent to fihoot. Mr. Deshener's wife, who
was a spectator \u25a0 of. the thrilling scene,
instantly became hysterical, ! which . only
served to Intensify Mr. Deshener's ' reso
lution, for he sprang upon Quong Wing
and kicked him out of the room and
down the stairs. By that time other
ladles had Joined Mrs. Deshener in
hysteria, while others of more fortitude
merely trembled and emitted, screams.
Quong. Wing did' not. shoot, but went and
lodged complaint against Mr. Deshener,
who was arrested for. battery.
When his feminine witnesses failed to
deliver the goods he had expected, Quong
Wing told Judge Conlan that he would
like to have the testimony of- Police Ser
geant Moftatt heard, that: vigilant and
ever-veracious ofScer; having effected Mr.
Deshener's arrest. Quong Wing's request
was granted, and the case will be given
another" inning this morning.

WRITES OF THE LEDGES
IN NEVADA FIELDS.
Bulletin Issued ;in^hich New Discoveries of
Gplizi ;iri\Â©ld/RegionsvAre Predicted.;^
University Authority Tellsiof the; Gorristoek and
Discusses Surrounding Region. : - ,
The ;UnlversJty, of California l.has Just
issued a. bulletin, ..written' 'by; John -A.
Reid, treating; a subject of more' than or
dinary, interest in", viewjjof the great \u25a0min
eral developments, of "mining camps in
Nevada. To - a' ( Â« description , of;. the pecu
liarities "of formation -of :\u25a0 the v Comstock
bonanzas and the- Nevada.fleld'Mr. Reid
addresses himself, ' and ;what" he says may
be of ereat value' to- the' thousanda who
are searching for 'gold. '.' .. ;
The present -developments Cin ' mining
work. wtl tea Mr. Reid, have thrown much
light upon the question of genesis. -In the
Virginia City portionCof the lode the ore
occurs not in<thÂ«",,'maln fissure, but |in
openings or.veins in 'the : hanging wall,
which occupy nearly, vertical positions.
These - veins .' are more nearly allied to
gash 1 veins than v to- what are usually
called fissure veins. - y _.' â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0â¢ \
The secondary .vein baa brought to light
some Interesting facts. It has been found
in only the lower mine levels, either aa a
mere fault â¢ zone >' or, productive ' deposit;
From the lines of motion preserved finely
in the clay gouge the relative j movement
of i the walls is seen to have been nearly
horizontal, whether "i north 'or . south . the
writer has not -been able 'to determine. *
On this Interesting point Mr. : Reid;as
sertsi that "from the parts of the velniob
eerved, chiefly on the 2060-foot level!
(Ophir ground), it' seems â¢ probable - that
the motion was to tits-s outh. for the east
wall, dipping downward about; four de
grees-In the same direction. This corre
sponds to the view, that ths vein itself Is
due to a pulling apart of- the pock mass,
causing the greatest openings to ths
north, In the concavity : caused by the
bending of the vein .to, ths v east at the
north end.. This northeastward \u25a0wing
cauÃea the secondary opening , to become
nearly parallel with -the' Sierra- Nevada
fork."
The bonanzas of OoM.Hlll arÂ« reported
by Mr. Reid to be : t ound In the lode
proper, near the , east wall and east of
the low.yrade quart*. ; . ,
PREDICTS" GOLDEN FBTUBH.
Some predictions and a number of In
teresting statements are made in the'bul
letin, in part as follows: '
The fleeo ore bbdlei of Virirlnla City have
been and will be found within the hanging
wall in more or lesrf vertical flssuresv of which
the surface east vein, the "great bonanza,
and the. vein now beine: worked are example*.
More such bodies should be found by, properly
driven crosscuts and drifts lower down and to
the eastward. There is also \u25a0 a larÂ«e stretch
of the lode above the 2150 level, which has not
been thoroughly explored. , The probable reason
for the peculiar rifting of the hanging wan
block is that the cementing of the first frac
ture by quartz and the concomitant weakening
of the hanging wall by the leaohlng action of
the ground waters enabled the latter, stresses
to fracture the. hanging wall block as it is
found. The reason for believing ins till deeper
similar rifts, filled with ore, is that- the sur
face two mllea eastward from the â¢ lode shows
the hanging, wall block to be greatly altered
by the action iof hot water, and therefore
weakened. The Sutro tunnel section corrobo
rates this, and the mine workings also chow
the rooks east of the lode not to be oolld nor
unaltered. \u25a0 \u25a0 - \u25a0 ' '
Mr. Reid says that there is also a con
centration of ore taking place from above
by the surface waters.- "These ores." he
writes, "will occur on or 'near the foot
walls of > the | numerous { branches of the
lode which outcrop on, the surface."
Of Mount Davidson and the country ad
jacent Mr. Reid writes in part as follows:
\u25a0 MOUXT DAVIDSON REGION.
Mount ! Davidson"' Is a. "diorits mass bounded
on all sides by faults, and has risen relatively
to the surrounding', country. ; The Comstock
lode occuplPs the fissure made by the east fault
bounding the mass. \u25a0 The west fault now shown
in the Hale & Nbrcross tunnel Is not occupied
by a vein in the tunnel, because the ' compres
slve stresses have been \u25a0 too great. Farther
search, both along this fault, and particularly
farther west, may easily result in. the finding
of ore. \u25a0 There are no reasons for assuming the
non-existence of | ore .In the west country, nor
elsewhere in -the faulted region, surrounding
Mount Davidson, especially, to the south," where
the country is more fractured and broken." \u25a0\u25a0
\u25a0 A further word concerning I Mount Davidson
may - not .be amiss, - although , the - subjeot has
not been, fully; investigated, -on account of the
time necessary. On 'the Carson sheet the mass
of Mount Davidson is seen to be a roughly rec
tangular mass : approximately two by one and
a half miles, with . the major axis . north . and
south, bounded on all . sides by steep slopes.
The eastern slope ;is ' noted \u25a0 for ' the ' Cometock
lode. The surface |of thts mountain mass is
that of an old eroded region, . as noted "by
Becker, which has been uplifted above the sur
rounding country. One standing on the sum
mit of Mount Davidson cannot fall to be struck
wkh the mature character ot the topography.
Th's eroded, gently rolling aurf aoe exists well
preserved in the Sierra Nevada â¢to the " west,
now broken . and displaced by later faulting
action. \u25a0 The history of . the Sierra and Vir
ginia ranges is identical in. the main features.
These statements will be proved by a citation
of facts [in a subsequent paper ' now in \u25a0 prep
aration. The result* of this oonoeptlon - are
obvious and far reaching.' The location of 'the
Comstock Is well known on the east. On the
south are other ore bodies In the American
Flat region, but' all of the south has. not been
prospected. One well developed west fault has
recently been shown in ' the Hale & Norcross
tunnel, and more- will follow. The maximum
faulting on the west is farther to the west than
the present face of this tunnel. To the north
several quartz bodies are known to exist on the
surf ac* over the ; broken - country, but the de
tails here are \u25a0 not â¢â¢ yet - known. There \u0084 la
abundant reason for suspecting the existence of
ore on other sides of Mount Davidson than the
east. â¢ â¢ ,-;:".. . .

MARYSVILLE, Sept. I.â A number of
prominent orchardists in Sutter County
do not agree with the -State University
experts and those of the United States
Department of Agriculture \ who have
visited the pear orchards here and de
clared that the trees are affected by
pear blight. They claim the disease
is caused by an excessive moisture in
tho ground that causes the sap in the
trees to sour. As a proof fat their con
tention the growers point out that .'all
the j affected trees are on low land that
is continuallymolst, while on the high
ground the pear trees are not diseased.
The same opinion' prevails' among Bev

i* STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. I.â
The' Guild of Stanford 1 University held
a meeting last evening, at which it was
decided not to remove the hospital of
the- students from its present site In
Palo Alto, but to make such conces
sions- to the residents of the town as to
no longer, make -the Institution objec
tionable to them. 'This is an important
step in insuring the welfare of the stu
dents of the university.
\u25a0 The latter part of "last spring the
property-owners in the .vicinity of the
Guild. Hospital objected to the institu
tion and threatened to take the matter
before the courts. They objected to
the hospital on the ground that as the
townspeople were excluded from mem
bership and were not given attention In
the , hospital, the keeping of the con
cern within the boundary of the town
of Palo Alto was a. transgression of the
State law which forbids the transmis
sion of persons suffering from con
tagious diseases from one locality to
another. ' ;
The action of the guild has cleared
the matter up entirely. The solution
was simply to allow the townspeople to
attend the hospital. . They will be
charged J4 a day for the regular ser
vice and extra for special . attentlbn.
The admittance of the residents of Palo
Alto to the benefits of the institution
not only pleases the citizens, but invali
dates the objection to the transmission
of those suffering from contagious dis
eases.
The faculty was also granted several
concessions. If a member of the fac
ulty in the future' ls a member of the
hospital,. which can be arranged. by the
payment of a. fee of 52, all in the Im
mediate family of this member are en
titled to the benefits of the institu
tion and will be charged a rate of $1 50
a day. A similar concession has been
made the coaches, - trainers . and man
agers of the university.

THE ADMINISTRATION PLATFORM:
n^HE political" convention which renominated Mayor Schmitz
I ; # also adoj>te.J a platform, g;rcat in length and eager in its de
*\u25a0 fense of his ajdinir.istratioir. The convention Was a part of that
clahorste plan, long in action here, to. mask a very vile sort of
politics behind the name of labor. It is not a new trick. Going
hack a Jew years our people remember that political control -of
this city, .by a sniccessful boss who set up a bad government, though
better than what, we suffer now, was maintained by an elaborate
niasmferailo -as an .anti-monopoly and anti-railroad movement. It
captured enough votes, time and again, to maintain itself in power,
end it* staved until a Grand Jury got after-it. V :
history Is. being repeated. Labor, being organized. Is attrac
tive, as/ all organization is, tci the professional politician, and that
da?? has succeeded until now in converting to every vile purpose an
organization that war: "made originally for a far different purpose.
This movement' iias made of Mayor Schmitz a prominent person
ality/ deceptive and attractive to a class, self-constituted, among
bnr citizens,Â«,VThe platform is elaborately drawivto make this de
ception, effective. Everything, movement and person, opposed to
graft and crime protected by the city government-, is denounced as
The : ji;ui who drew the platform is, after all, short-sighted.
The space given tt> denunciation of the. Citizens' Alliance and to the
T.ttempt toidentify it as the power behind the Republican League and
v the .Grand Jury is space, wasted in advertising that body in a way
for which it shonldbc gratefull As a matter of fact it has no more
, to tlo .\vith the movement to destroy the partnership between gov
ernment and crime in San Francisco than the Labor party, so cailed,
has.* , .
*â¢ A careful reading of the platform develops the complete al
liance which astute politicians have made between class and graft.
Everything that has interfered with this is denounced. The Board
<jf Supervisors is trounced for not giving more money to be spent
, Â«b.y the grafting branch of the government. Public ownership and
operation of public utilities is demanded by the grafters, because it
means more graft. Looking around for prey, the platform also
demands that all of the patronage and revenues of the water front
- be "turned over to municipal grafters. Threats of industrial dis
*ttirbances are made in the event of defeat of the grafters. The Grand
jury, the courts and the newspapers are roasted to a turn, and no
. appeal useful to the demagogue is omitted to create a political class,
maintain its solidarity and perpetuate it as an instrument of spolia
"tion." The convention was skillfully manipulated by the parasitic
politicians, who have dodged in and out of all parties, served under
aH the past bosses, made hay whenever the sun shone on the field
of graft, and fattened on the protected vice and crime of the city.
â¢The Mayor's speech accepting the nomination was inoculated
by the virulence of the platform. â¢ It was venomous and vitupera
tive, lurid, florid and aflame with passion. It was his idea of what
a' plea should be to the kind of support he is courting. Read be
tweeu the lines,- it had a note of sadness because some of his
stanchest supporters were not present. Several who had the bad
couragf'of their tvil convictions have been sent to the penitentiary
in punishment, of their zeal for his cause. But even for them a
good time coming' is promised, for the Mayor's supporters look
forward to making him Governor, when he will have the pardoning
power. -His speech was also largely . devoted to the Citizens' Al
liance, and he chased that bogy up and down the stage and dusted
it's jacket to Ins heart's content. He also threatened the peace and
property of the city with dire disorders to come if he is not re-
. elected.. In a more than vague. way he menaced what he calls the
"capitalists." They 'were notified to purchase immunity from trouble
by" helping to elect him, or they must take the consequences.
Returning to the imitative feature of the situation, to men not
old all this ranting and threatening is perfectly familiar. We had
it when graft ami crime were masquerading behind anti-monopoly,
* and we have it now that the same allies are pretending to repre
sent labor.' It is simply an old trick in a new place, and it will hot
succeed, for it is exposed and its features are known. But no one
can deny the skillful quality of the Mayor's demagogy. Nor must
, his appeal to the prejudices of *a. purely artificial class be underrated.
The city is threatened by a danger so grave, so far reaching in its
results, as to" justify instant vjgilance. When a man is so confident
of his class control that he is bold to denounce every instrument of
order and every agency of the law, it is time to be awake to the
peril that threatens San Francisco.
A STUDY OF BIRTH RATES.
pvROFESSOR WALTER F. WILLCOX, of Cornell University,
Y~^ has just made a report to the Secretary of Commerce and La
*â¢ bbr -upon the proportion of children in the population of the
United States. It is based upon the age and sex statistics contained
in the twelfth and the preceding censuses. Its intention is to in
dicate the direction and extent of changes in the birth rate. It is
considered by 'the. -.Bureau of the Census to be- a valuable contribu
tion. to this important subject. As the present age is a crisis time
in the discussion of "race suicide" the bulletin is a pertinent one.
Sociologists and moralists may make what deductions, seem; wise
to* them from the statistics, but the fact that the birth rate is on
the decline shows up .so.distinct and conspicuous as to invite and
demand attention. . . .
It^sounds odd to say so, but the birth rate in the United Statics,
past or present, is unknown. It can be arrived at only indirectly,
by inference from other statistics. ~ The present study is mainly
made from figures which show the proportion^ of children under: five
years of age .to # the number of women of child-bearing age. It
thus comes closer to be a sho\vingoi the number of' cnildren; sue-*
cessfully re,ared_ through infancy than- to a record of births. In
1900 there were only. three-fourths as many living children to each
ioojo potential mothers as in iB6O. This decline is most notable
among native American white women. Foreign-born women '''who
have children are 710 in the, thousand, to only. 462 of the native.
The non-Caucasian 'races,' of whom in* our country the negroes pre
ponderate, so much as to make them virtually the, whole, have 585
children to 508 of the whites." The comparison of cities with country
districts and. small to.wns is very striking. The white women of
the cities have only 390 children to 572 in the rural homes. ;'.
â¢ Whatever minor causes there may be, the chief "cause for the
decline. in birth Tate is the deliberate avoidance of child-bearing by
American white" women. It is more prevalent because of the dif-r
fusion.of the opinion that it is not sinful; or contrary to the usual
religions creeds, for married women to avoid "maternity, but that
under some circumstances', it may be commendable. .It is easily;
seen that'the. question of morality in this big new fact of modern

The Perm newspapers ' give great prom
inence to the case of an extraordinary
prisoner . named Kaspianoff, a : music hall
artist, who has been sentenced to seven
years' hard labor for attempUrig to kiss
young ladles against their will, says the
Vienna corrspondent of the Washington
Post. Kaspianoff is the man who about
a year ago cheated Justice by an extraor
dinary trick. Charged with a disgraceful
assault, the case' was .. amply 1 proved,
when, to the amazement *of \u25a0 the; Judge
and every one in the court, the foreman
of the Jury brought in a verdict of "not
guilty." A riot ensued, in which the JUry
men were . belabored with umbrellas. The
Judge told . the . jurymen that their ; deci-'
elon was a travesty on justice.
Later, in the day the jury in a body,vis
ited the Judg-e and declared Â£h.at. it was
not "theY who had accrtrflted. the ' prisoner.'
The words "not; guilty" had not been ut
tered by -their foreman, and they had
every reason to believe that the prisoner,
Kaspianoff, who waa a well-known ven
triloquist, had "by Satan's arts fooled the
learned court." ;
In the case Just tried the principal wit
ness for the prosecution was a lad named
Karazin, who suffered, from a serious
Impediment in . his speech. Taking â¢ ad
vantage' âof this fact Kaspianoff once
again daringly attempted to put> favorable
evidence in the witness' mouth. But, un
fortunately for the ventriloquist, it was
Judge Malyinsky who was . : trying ;the
caseâ the same Judge,". In fact, who had
tried the prisoner in the notorious trial
of a year ago. ' -
"Gag that man," he cried.; "Kaspianoff
shall not escape \u25a0 this time.". t and â¢ the un
fortunate ventriloquist got seven years'
hard labor, nominally for creating a riot
in the streets ~of ; Perm by attempting ; to

ANTI-BLASTING

Gray Brothers and pther . contractors

li'abeas corpus when convicted of violat
'ihg the ofdinarrae, and declared the city
crdinance prohibiting blasting within cer
tain' sections of the city tÂ» be invalid.
The decision is the result of years of
trpubfe and court actions to prohibit

CELTIC UNION
PLANS REVIVAL
The united Irish societies held a spe
cial meeting last evening in the assem
bly room of the Panott building: to re
ceive reports of committees and complete
arrangements for the. annual festival, to
be held Saturday, September 9, at Shell
Mound Park.
Thomas M. Cearey, president of the
Celtic Union, was chairman. Jeremiah
Deasy of the executive committee on fes
tival reported that the work of the sub
committees was practically completed. He
could assure the societies that the pro
gramme was an excellent one and would
give great satisfaction. The list of games
was very full and included contests for
all classes In running, jumping, etc., with
the usual humorous contestsâ egg races,
barrel races, hurdle races, three-legged
races and similar contests.
He said a large numOer of well-known
athletes would attend and there would
be representatives from the different col
leges and athletic clubs. The Ancient Or
der of Hibernians' tug-of-war would be a
very exciting contest.
Mr. Deasy announced as the finance
committee Thomas Doyle, E. P. Hogan,
T. M. Cearey, W. J. Hudson, J. P. Hare,
J. C. Condon and John Mulhern.
In the Gaelic dancing B. J. Sylver re
ported that great interest was being
taken. As for the games, cash prizes
would be given. Besides the Irish step
dancing the committee had added the
Scotch steps, sword dance and Highland
fling in costume, and they expected this
would be a very attractive feature.
Mr. Dillon of Sacramento, the champion
jig dancer of the coast, was expected to
be present.
Reports from delegates of the Atacient
Order of Hibernians, the Knights of the
Red Branch, Knights of Tara. Knights of
St. Patrick, the County Leitrim Club and
St. Patrick's Alliance stated that these
societies would be largely represented at
the festival. It was decided that as the
games programme was so lengthy there
be no literary exercises this year.
John Mulhern addressed the meeting as
treasurer of the Irish hall fund. He had
some $15,000 on hand, and as this festival
would go to swell that fund he hoped it
would be successful. The interest taken
in this annual outing by the Irish people
of this city was very gratifying. He be
lieved that the attractions at the festival
would be superior In variety, in ' prizes
and in athletic work to those of any" fes
tival given before by the Irish societies.
J. D. Condon reported many sales of
hall stock since the last meeting.

ADMITS PERJURY
WAS COMMITTED
. Sensational developments may be ex
pected from the Turtle cafe squabble fol
lowing the arrest of John McNamara, the
manager, for felony .embezzlement on
Thursday afternoon and the arrest of
Frank Kelly, Fred .Dougherty, Robert
Larios and James E. Carberry later on a
charge of disturbing the peace.
F. M. Metcalf, who swore to the com
plaints for the arrest of Kelly, Dough
erty, Larios and Carberry, admitted to
the District Attorney yesterday that the
four men did not disturb the peace In
any shape or form. He said they accom
panied Attorney McPike when he entered
the saloon and announced that as presi
dent of the board of directors he had
come to take possession of the cafe. Mc-
Pike asked him to retire from his post
behind the bar, and he put on his hat aD<i
walked out. :
Metcalf said he afterward met McNa
mara and Attorney Frank J. Murphy and
told them what had happened. Murphy
advised him to swear out warrants for
the arrest of the four men so that they
could be taken out of the cafe by the po
lice and McNamara could regain posses
sion. Acting on this advice, Metcalf de
clared, he swore to the warrants.
"Did the four men or either of them
make any disturbance?" asked the Dis
trict Attorney.
"They did. not," replied Metcalf.
Later the District Attorney had a con
sultation with Attorney McPike, who
said he would swear out a 1a 1 warrant for
Metcalf's arrest on a charge of perjury,
and possibly another warrant for the ar
rest of Attorney. Murphy on "a charge of
subornation of perjury. . ' ..
McNamara was arraigned before Police
Judge Mogan yesterday on a charge of
felony embezzlemnt. and. the case was
continued until Tuesday. The four men
charged with disturbing the peace ap
peared before Police Judge Conlan, and
their cases were also continued.
An attachment was filed yesterday
against the Turtle cafe for $299 99, and the
Sheriff's officers failed to serve It, as the
place was closed. ThÂ© attachment was
rendered abortive, however, during the
afternoon by H. H. McPlke, who filed
a bond to cover the indemnity.

CATTLE KING
VISITING CITY
William E. Halsell, widely: known
throughout the Southwest as the cattle
king of Indian Territory,; arrived \u25ba here
yesterday from the north" and :Is reg
istered-at the Palace Hotel. He.lsac-;
companied by his . wifs, a Cherokee
woman, and their two* daÂ«ghterB, with
whom he has been : viewing thÂ« Lewis
and Clark Exposition. ,
In the early days of the Territory
Haleell's " herds : of ' cattle, numbering
more than 20,000 head, grazed upon I the
prairies of Texas.'from which they were
driven twenty-five years * ago .by; "a
drought. â¢' Halsell and , his herds .went
northward and he finally settled in the
watered region of the Cimarron River
and its tributaries in the interior of the
Indian . country. At that " time ' there
was hardly a white man .within the
borders of the Territory where . Halsel 1
decided to make his future home*.; \u25a0'
Later "Halsell met and- wooed, a
Cherokee maiden and they were eventuT
ally blessed with three daughters and
a son, the latter now a prosperous busi
ness man In the Territory. The present
home of the HalÃells is at Vinlta. -He
owns % thousands of acres of . land jln
the Cherokee, Creek and Choctaw coun
try, and has recently purchased* 200,000
acres of land in Texas, where :he has
placed a large herd of cattle.
Of the affairs in the Territory Halsell
said yesterday the white people there
want theV Territory admitted to state
hood with Oklahoma, as one State.
Single statehood is opposed by the
Indians, among, whom are some of the
shrewdest politicians of the Southwest.
The white inhabitants expect that -the
next Congress will grant Indian Terri
tory statehood. - \ :
Halsell is largely interested in oil
lan.ds about â¢ Tulsa and at Chelsea,
where many great' wells have ; been
opened. He says there is a determined
effort to prevent the Standard Oil Com
pany from dominating in ; Indian Terrl-'
tory and conditions prevailing there
make it impossible forthe trust to gain
control. From : here the Halsells will
return to their;' Southern .home- and
later goto Boston, where â¢ the daugh
ters of the cattle king are' to be placed
in' school. - ;/- ? :^i'^^-- : :. ; :;'-''- : ' . : \u25a0 \u25a0

.* of the Hotel Rafael
MISS SUTTON THE STAE
Famous Little Player Will
Be Here Next Week to
Defend Her . Coast Title
The annual tennis tournaments for the
.championship of the Pacific States will
commence this morning on the Hotel
Rafael courts at San RafaeL These are
the moÃt important events" of the year in
;this part of the country and attract play
ers from all parts of the West. There
will be fewer championship class players
*tv th* competitions than in the past, but
there will not be an entire lack of class.
Such players .as Hal Braley, Reuben
Hunt, PTed Adams- and Percy Murdock
will insure a certain amount of class.
â¢ Braley will be the strongest player from
the. south, and -Is said to be playing a
much stronger game than when he ap
peared here last. He will have to show
Improvement to dispose of Hunt and
Adams. These three players look to have
the best chance to annex the champion
ship and feach represents a different sec
tion. Braley is from- Los Angeles, Adams
from San Francisco and Hunt, formerly
cf 'Alameda, really represents the Bast.
Murdock will not play in the singles and
it looks- almost a certainty the champion
ship wfJl go to. either Hunt, Adams or
'Brkley.;
Aside; from these cracks such experts
as G'HJrge Janes, S. Sinsabaugh, Carl
Gardner, Harry Rolfe, Herbert Schmidt,
George Busch and many lesser lights will
figure In the singles.
In tile doubles the teams will be pos
sibly , a trifle stronger than they were
last- year, but they will by no means
possess class of former years. The
most prominent teams are Hunt and
Murdock "of Alameda, Adams and Janes
of San Francisco, Rolfe and Schmidt of
San Francisco and Braley and Slnsa
tiaiigh of Los Angeles. The first and last
mentioned teams look to nave the cham
pionship between* them.
Hunt and Murdock have tried several
tim.es for the championship, but have
.never "come close to winning it. On their
last appearance three years ago they
were beaten rather easily by Smith and
Mac-Gavin in one of the early rounds.
Hunt." has undoubtedly improved since
then and should give his partner better
support than in the past.
.Braley and Slnsabaugh have not played
together, but both know the game thor
oughly. They will be the team for ilur
dcck and Hunt to beat.
Adams and Janes are a new team, and
.'it Js-hard to size them up. Janes plays
better doubjes than singles, but the re
, verse Is true of Adams. They may prove
â¢ tile surprise".
Carl Gardner and Grant Smith possibly
i will piay together, but as the latter play-
has been out at the game for so long
; he anfl his .partner will probably not cut
much of a figure. Smith has not touched
a. racket /or about six weeks and has
-played but little in the last two years. If
he can get into any shape by Wednesday
'he 'and Gardner will make trouble for
come of the teams.
The presence of World's Champion May
Sutton aud her clever Bisters will make
the women's events fully as Interesting
as the men's. The little champion will
surely be here in time to defend her. title,
and* possibly be in time to compete in the
dpubles. Several, other clever lady play
ers frotn the south will also participate.
They are Mrs. and Miss Seymour, Miss
Dobbins,- Miss Ryan -and Miss Peralta.
Following is the order of events: Men's
6ingles, Saturday, September 2, at 10

.. . â¢NELSON RECEDES IN THE BETTING
JIMMY BRITT IS INSTALLED
A 75 TO 100 CHOICE.
Work of the Californian Impresses the
Sporting Wiseacres. :. .
Jeffries Is Made a Formal Offer of $1000
to Referee the Big Fight. '
The odds on the Britt-Nelson fight
went down with a rush yesterday and
when "they finally settled the Califor
nian - was a strong 75 to 100 choice.
liie odds had been 9 to 10 for several
Ouys; but the flood of money offered on
Britt made this a false price. The
bookmakers tried to keep up the odds
for a time." but they found it was fu
tile, so the betting adjusted itself.
Britt never before had such a follow
ing as he has this time, and it is dif
ficult to tell where the price will final
ly settle.
These 'odds will probably effectually
dispose of "the side bet. Britt was pre
pared to let some of his friends in on
his end of the $10,000 wager and he
could raise the money In an hour. To
get even money when the prevailing
odds will probably be 6 to 10 looked
good to some heavy bettors and they
snapped at the opportunity.
Nelson will have difficulty in secur
ing his end of the money for the same
reason that Britt would find it easy.
Nelson did not intend to bet his own
money and his friends will hardly put
ur> even money when they can secure
a much better price for their coin.
The loser of the 'fight will hardly be
penniless after it is over. Instead of the
winner taking all the purse it will prob
ably aevelop that he will be satisfied
with sixty per cent, while the loser can
salve his Injured feelings with the other
forty Der Gent
le Jeffries, who has been selected as ref
pree. Is still at Catalina Island. He wired
Manager Coffroth yesterday: "Will not
accept amount offered."
, A return wire was sent by Coffroth
raying": ''Have been authorized to offer
JluoO fee for Briu-Nelson, Sept. 9. Wire
quickly."
* No answer was received to this up to
a* late hour. As a matter of fact Jef
fries had been made no offer up to yes
terday, Coffroth's 'previous telegram to
him merely containing the Information
that the usual fee for such work was
800.
The sale of seats will commence this
rooming at 30 O'Farrell street. A large
proportion of the seats have been ordered
in advance.
The arena will be completed on Tues
day. The bleachers and the ring are al
ready up and the remainder of the seats
can be finished at short notice. The en
tire place will be covered with pungent
tan bark, which, will be reminiscent of
horse shows and other sporting events.
RRITT** GREAT CONFIDENCE.
Comfits l-nisuccjnrnt Seem* to Give tbe
Oallfornlan Xo Concern.'
The fresh, appetizing air wafted in from
the" Pacific and the infectious air of su
preme confidence which permeates the at
mosphere all contribute to make life an
.ideal existence about Jimmy Britt's train
ing -quarters at Sheehan's villa on the
ocean beacn. - . . .â¢
| Confidence is two-thirds of a fighter's
Etock in trade and James Edward Britt
possesses this qualification to a marked
degree^ â at least as far as any outward
, appearances indicate. Possibly, like Pitts
burg Phil, the noted turf plunger, he sup
presses his emotions. Then again, the
Caiifbrnla boy may be a fatalist. When
all the haggling was going on over the
selection of a referee and his brother â
Manager Willisâ was making a bonfire of
his face, lighting up huge Importations
from the Havana tobacco plantations,
Jimmy assumed the attitude of a epbynx.
His only remark was "well, the fortune
teller told me a dark man with a bundle
would be a big factor In the fight." No
body ever accused Jim Jeffries of being
a chemical blonde, so he must be tbe
in an referred to by the seeress.
Yesterday was no different from any
' ether day at Britt's camp. Its . a trifle
early for the sports from High Hat, Red
Onion and other Interior points to be
here â but they're on the way. An ex
tended gathering of ring-goers from
tewn collected in groups on the veranda
at- Sneehan's, talking In whispers. It
must be remembered that everything in
connection with a prize fight, or at least
boxing contests, is always on the low
down. If It were not so. It would be on
the high up, and then, of course, no
pecrecy whatever could be observed. To
.be on intimate terms enough to grasp
Ja&es Edward Britt by the hand makes
a marked man of a person at the beach
just now. Time was when Britt was con
t'iaered an interloper in the arena. Now
he is a public idol.
Manager Willis Britt checked an 'in
cipient conflagration in its infancy Just
after Jimmy, his trainers and a big crowd
had flocked into the gym. Posted in a
conspicuous place is a Eign, "No Smok
ing." X Bailor from East street failed to
observe the* warning and lighted up a
pipe, emitting a volume of smoke which
fof fragrance made a frankfurter sausage
factory "loom up like a cologne manufac
tory- Willis delivered himself of an ora
tion on the uss and abuse of the weed
tliat will some day become a classic in
pugilistic history. -Ail smoking immediate
ly ceased. *
\u25a0 < It . was nearly 4 o'clock when Jimmy
startefi io working, a trip through the
fiarrk and a row on Stow Lake with "Tiv"
KrÂ»ling consuming the greater portion of
the day. After warming up with the
skipping rope. Britt and Frank Rafael
put fan the gloves. Jimmy was lavish
with his favors, and, with hard right
and lefts, had Frank blowing hard at the
end of /our rounds. He let Johnny
\u25a0 Frayne, the young amateur, down much
lighter In a three-round bout. Two rounds
of walloping and lugging with Kreling,
'eoine bag ptmchjng, pully exercise and a
plunge in the surf completed his work.
Irr former days Britt was always given
credit for having a knockout punch con
cealed In his right glove, but many of
hii mate recent battles would convey the
in^pression that his left band was the
â¢nor.ey -getter. .â He is now working his
' right overtime and It goes off like the
poji of a champagne cork, with no'tele
graphic communication neither.
Otto'Floto. Liie popular and efficient
sportir^ editor of the Denver Post, has
â¢ written Manager Britt t-at he will be
at the ringside with a party of twenty
five Denvfritfes*.
â¢' XELSOX TRIES XEW lUXG.
The Dane U'orki on an Outdoor Plat
form at Colma.
# The main event at Battling Nelson's
training camp at Colma yesterday was
the dedication of the new ring, situated
In the open air alongside the main
gymnasium. The Dane was so anxious
to get into action there that he insisted
on donning the gloves and mixing it up
with his .sparring partners before he
did'his usuu.l grind in the gymnasium.
The place was surrounded by a motley
throng when the Dane stepped into the
â¢ new ring:.
TbÂ« Dane first put on the mitts with
Roy Stone, a husky-looking welter
weight from the Olympic Club. He
hammered Roy so hard; and with such
vlciousness that the latter was ready,
to say good-night at the end of the
second round, when the-reliable Bobby
Lundie, also of the Olympic Club, was
trotted out.
For three rounds the pair swapped
wallops and waded in at each other In
the same old way. The Dane was buf
feted and banged around in every
round, but he seemed to like this sort
of going. It can certainly do him no
good, as such punishment must tell on
him in time. .\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 -. . ..
After finishing: with the boxing the
Dane took to the gymnasium and
toyed with the machines while -the
crowd looked on. When he had worked
for a time he took on George Brauh
for three rounds of wrestling and tug-,
ging, which seemed to be to his liking.'
The punching bag also came in for a
few wallops and then it was over for
the afternoon. â¢ â¢ " ' '
Although Nelson worked at a lively
pace at times . he did not perform as
rapidly as on the two previous days.
The boxing bouts in which he indulged
yesterday were rather tame onÂ» the
whole and the rounds were short. Fred
Landers, the crack lightweight, will
join the camp to-day and then some
lively milling Is looked for.
Nelson is angry clear through because
Jimmy Britt accuses him of butting in
their last fight. "I didn't butt Britt. 1
never butt." he said yesterday. "I don't
think Jimmy will look me squarely. ' in
the eyes and accuse me of butting on that
occasion. His forehead was cut all right,
but I did it with the knuckles of. my
Tiands â a fair right cross. As to' the in
jury to Young Corbett's head, I'd like to
tell my side of that story. He was
gashed above the hair line, and a pretty
bad gash it was. He could never have
been hurt in that spot if he did not have
his head lowered. He wasMtryihgr to butt
me and he got the worst 'of It. . It was
simply a case .of my head being, harder
than his." ; -..-'. â¢
BANTAMS IX FINISH FIGUT. l
Harry Tenny and Monte AtteU-Wllt
Mevt at .Tnuopnh This Month. - -.
Monte Attell and Harry Tenhy signed
articles yesterday to fight to a finish
before the Tonopah Athletic Club at
Tonopah, Nev., on September 12. Thi
boys have been guaranteed a J2OOO purse
by the managers of the club. They will
weigh in at 116 pounds ringside.
It will be a big event in the mining
town, as the new railroad will be open
ed on that day, and people from . all
parts of the State will take advantage
of the occaoion,to ride on the new line
and see the little fellows fight It should
prove a great battle, for both boys are
fighters of the rush order, who can
stand a lot of hard going. ! ;

Harris had many good offers for his

Many of the wise fans were looking:
to see the Siwashes lapse -into their'
old ways yesterday Afternoon at Recre-*
ation Park, but this stunt never, came'
off. They kept up that peerless'record'
they have made . for fast - ball ; for /the j
last few days and fought the Seals to a:
finish. Only one run was] scored dur
ing the progress of the battle, and Hitt
registered that one in the sixth, break
ing up a game that was a wonder in ;
every respect.
There were two down when Hltt beat,
out a bunt in the sixth, so it did not
look good to 'the' fans..'". Waldron' then ;.
singled to center and when Mohler
laced out a double to 'deep left field all.
was excitement, while;;: Hitt raced â¢
through to the pan. \u25a0 On 'came Waldron,.
but Houtz and Russ Hall got away "with;
a great . r^lay- throw : and Waldron' was
nailed at the pan. -;. : , \u25a0 ; â¢'*.'-\u25a0= ".'.
The entire game hinged on the work
of the' pitchers: and there was little' to
choose between them, so grand- .Was
their control, speed and prowess to foal
the batsmen. Many times both became
tangled up in bad holes, but fast field
ing and a bit of luck always happened
at the right moment and the game was
thus saved for both of them several
times. " â¢ X'-'y
Hitt got into a bad box in the eighth
spasm, when . the Siwashes made it*, a
full house and one down on two singles'
and a base on balls. It looked bad for,
the Seals, -but Hitt was there and he
got the next two men easily by his
clever work and heady pitching.
The Siwashes made a dying stand in
the last spasm when Cap Hall sent
Blankenship in to bat for Houtz.
Blank beat out a hit to Gochnauer and
was ready to; sprint all the way around/
Runkle forced him at second. 4 Runkle
took a chance and tore down the line.
He got away with the. steal, and ambled
to third on Wilson's bad peg. ;>lt was
up to Clarke to pull the. game out""for,
the Siwashes, but the best he had was
a high fly to Spencer, so all was over
them. The score:

LONDON TAKES
TO ICED DRINKS
" .LONDON, vM Sept.^ l.>r-To the>> steadily .
Increasing." influence , of American ] vlsl- ;
.tors .and residents. In London is largely
attributed -the "great; increase jl in the
consumption; /of vice"' which;'" lias been I
noted for this season.- \u25a0 During â¢ the re
cent; hot -spell , It 'amounted to over
Jooo ; rtons- a \u25a0 day. ;a : mere/. fraction of
.what New,- York;: with a- smaller popu
lation, demands ini warm; weather, but
if is -.here! -considered an enormous
quantltyrJ : :*V ~~'7 .^"7^ ">.!? '-'~i '-"'\u25a0'" '; . " '\u25a0'.'
In the past most Englishmen have
been accustomed; to regard ice .water
and iced drinks of all j kinds as a ' per
niclous luxury. Doctors have told them
that they are responsible i for much of
the indigestion, dyspepsia and other,
ailments, with which. Americana are so
popularly supposed to be afflicted beyond
the rest .of mankind. But Americana
sojourning in London have j insisted ; on
being served ;with them when the tem
perature is oppressive, and hotels and
restaurants that ; cater to their custom
have found thatj It pays to give them
what they want.
In fear and trembling some of the
most venturesome English folk fol
lowed their example ' and finding that
tney. immediately felt on: better; terms
with themselves and the weather, and
that no' dire results ensued, they capit
ulated. Then they told their friends
that they had discovered something
which the Joys of existence.
Of course, London is never subjected
to'such sweltering heat as many of the
big American cities. But this summer
there have been several days here when
the mercury has soared above eighty in
the shade. ' - \ ,
' One 'of " the largest medium priced
restaurants In London, which : was open
ed this year, has made a specialty of
American iced drinks jof the temper
ance variety, with the addition" of a few
that are mildly alcoholic' â¢ With an
American who understands the art of
preparing them' properly and artisti
cally In charge of the department, it
has proved the most popular feature of
the establishment. The of
American : soda'; water fountains in s the
metropolis jis rapidly ; increasing. ; One
of them has been' recently added- to'the
s American restaurant' in the Strand:
The American, in charge of'the foun
tain said that he had seen an'English
rnan take a strawberry; ice. cream /oda
with a Welsh" rarebit and then call for
another glass of it.'
"I jjuess," he added, "Rockefeller. would
give half his millions to swap stom
achs with that man." V
Many of the cheaper, restaurants dis
pense what, they call "American Iced
Long; Drinks." t There is not much that
is "Buggestive";_of Tan American origin
about them 'except the ice and \u25a0 \u25a0; the
straws,^ but they, serve : to ; increitse the
demand f or. ice.\ Ice Itself is no longer
regarded as a : pernicious luxury. , It iis
the price of . it here that people , object
to.' To* keep^a small family refrigera
tor going for -a' weekâ -such -as .in the
American cities would cost from *50 to
75 ; cents-^-here; necessitates an expendi
ture of between $3 ahd;s4. ;
Most of" the "Ice used; in London is
produced -artificially, the rest coming
chiefly from Norway. , .'\u25a0'\u25a0''\u25a0'-

NEW YORK, Sept. 1. â Pressure was -on at
tbe stock market to-day at the opening with
heavy sales of Amalgamated. In fact the first
: .'ur w*s the busiest for come time, trading
:n that brief period being twice as large as
â¢a the corresponding hour of the previous day.
Tte early break bore unmistakable evidence
.f forced liquidation, with a Wrong proportion
f short Kellirtg. The -forces on the bear side
'cnii verged largely around Amalgamated Cop
:*r and allied stock*, though euch Issues a>
Tenadian .PaeSSc. as well as Reading and the
were not spar*d. The decline Jn Am
.- Copper was soon explained to a
'â¢tree l>y* announcement cf a break of J /ic in
metal. This scarcely effseu the advance of
tbe**pÂ«Â«t fortnieht, but In view of the clanger
*;pnals sent out from Boston H was BUfficient
;.. smbject copper to a severe pounding. An
. ther iactor\for lower prices was an advance
. : 3 Dtr cer.t in call money. This rate was
apparently ficutlou6, however, inasmuch as
li.any' renewals were made until next Tues
..ay at 2% and 2% per cÂ«-nt. Prices recovered
come ff the Â«-arly declines, but rallies were
:..(;: Parted, and the market became narrow
and very dull. Many traders were disposed
to veil themselves of the coming holiday to
o;.,se out their commitments, and the attend
ance on the exchange to-morrow promised to
tr very Final!, thus creating what w:ll practi
cally be a triple holiday. No argument for
i.iiiher prices teas found in the forecast of
the week's money movements from this cerj
t^r. The banks show a loss to the sub-treasury
on the interior movement of over ?7,000.U00.
the ETeaier .part of which was tent north
enJ south. Although nothing has been \u25a0mii on
thi? DC/int, it is more than probable that local
''financial institutions have been making, di
rect shipments to the interior, of which there
if as jet no public record. At all events the
tank statement to-mcrrow i* awaited with
more ,thÂ«n the ueual degriee of interest, Â«nÂ«l
v ie aKoued that the ehcwiiyr will be less in
Â«xuiicable .than that of the previous week.
The ctrvnslh of the Morgan stocks, as diÂ«.tin
Â«uished from the so-railed Standard Oil group.
.occasioned much talk. There was good Â»-up
j^irt to the Vnited States Steel issues. Atch
;een ar.d the Erics. The heavy selling of Amer
:oa.a f-meltin?, which came chiefly from one
i i the most prominent brokerage nouses, was
Mild to represent pool liquidation In pan. This
i^sue naturally -was affected adversely by the
attack ujoii coÂ»r>er. It was not until the
late session that the market took on Its firm
est tcjie with increasing dullness. Prices re
covered to yesterday's closing level, but an
\u25a0 t'.f-r drive in the last hour caused fresh weak
:.<â¢Â«!â¢. Final quotations were about the lowest,
â¢he w&akest issues being Union Pacific, Erie
- .-r.d London and the other securi-
V- c*c '* markets abroad were generally better.
1 1 aris seemed to have recovered from Its re
cÂ»r.t local troubles, and the war issues were
tightly higher. . London operations hero
aniounted to about 30,000 chares, of witch
20,CÂ»j0 represeated purchases, chiefly of Atchi
eon, the Erics and the Steel stocks.
The Mexican line* issued report* of earnings

THE COPPEH MARKET.
BOSTON, Sept. I.â Lawson is out r.ith an
other telegram predicting a break. HÂ« prom
ises an advertisement to-morrow which will
show the copper metal market too altogether
artificial. The market shows no pressure at
the moment. " -
A report was spread on Thursday that Amer
ican Metal Company was offering copper at
concessions, but all consumers who tried to
buy copper from this company were obliged
to par full prices. .
A director of United Metal Selling Company
said yesterday: "We can at present take care
of only our best customers. Our people be
lieve that refined copper will average close
to 15% c all next year." I
The largest consumerc of refined copper in
. this- country are buying the metal constantly
at present prices. This week not less than
1,000.000 pounds have been purchased, most of
it for future delivery.
Copper Range declared a regular dividend.

pit was Inclined. to be bullish to-day. Decem
ber opened V&o up' at 81 .Additional rain in
the Northwest was the chief source ' of tncour-'
agement to bulls. A. moderate advance at Liv
erpool also helped a little here. Clear, weather,
predictions for to-morrow, gave price's a little'
setback during the first hour. The market
received good support from a. prominent trader
and the loss was quickly regulned. One report
to a commission house here stated'.that'seven
teen' stations in Minnesota and South ' Dakota
made the average yield 10}4 " bushels an acre.

PARTRIDGE MAY
BE CHAIRMAN
VounÂ«: Attorney Looniiug Up
Strong for Presiding Of
ficer of the Convention
COmiITTEE IN SESSION
blatters Pertaining to Cau
cus of the Anti vÃuef
Delegates Are Considered
' The organization committee of the San
Francisco Republican .League was in ses
sion at Daniel A. Ryan's office last night
from 8 o'clock until midnight. The mem
bers present were George D. Clark, chair
man; D. A. Ryan, secretary; David Rich,
Fairfax H. WheeJan. John D. Daly. E. J.
Bowes and Richard J. Welch. Postmas-;
ter Arthur G.-Fisk attended the confer
ence. Topics relating to the caucus of
league delegates and the chairmanship of
the convention were discussed. Another
. session of the committee will be held next
Tuesday evening. --
The impression prevails that John S.
Partridge, who presided bo acceptably
over the Republican convention two years
ago. will be recommended by the execu
tive committee for chairman of the con
â¢ vention. Several members oft the 'organi
zation favor the selection of .Daniel 'A.
Ryan for the honor, and William H. Da
vis, attorney of- the State Board of Har
bor Commissioners, is not without ad
herents.
Ruef is sounding members of the .Re
, publican County Committee to ; ascertain
if they would entertain a , proposition to
elect him chairman of the committee to
fill the vacancy caused by the death of
Thomas D. Riordan. As Colonel Charles
Sonntag has been duly chosen acting
chairman it . is regarded . as .certain that
I no \ other . chairman '\u25a0â will Â» be selected. \u25a0
Colonel Sonntag is a' fairly good ' presiding
officer. . He is able to perform all the
duties devolving upon a regular , chair
man. Ruef and Ach made one_fight in
the â¢ county committee at the outset of
the campaign and were completely, out
generaled and defeated. They cannot
gain by stealth what they lost in the
open.
It. ls expected that Ruef will bring to
b<ar all the pressure* and persuasion at
his command to prevent -the Republicans
and Democrats from placing in the field a
joint nominee for Mayor. The knowledge
that Ruef is alarmed at the prospect of
fusion stimulates the party leaders of the
â¢rtopublican and Democratic camps in
their purpose to bring, about coalition.
To achieve the desired 'result each con
vention will make concessions. In view
of the attitude of the Labor convention
and its declared hostility to everything
on ej-rth that is not labeled "Ruef and
Schmitz," a union of all the elements
of progressive, enlightened citizenship is
justified and demanded.,
The prospects of victory for good citl
zeufhip over the legions of graft are ex
ceedingly brjght. The promise of suc
cess is assuring in the light of events
and incidents of the Labor convention.
Schmitz himself made the assertion that
a large percentage of the labor vote was
unregistered and if this lack of registra
tion is significant at all, it signifies that
the worklngmen have had enough of Ruef
and Schmitz. The small vote of 4000 at
the primary election for delegates to the
Union Labor convention may be accounted
for on the theory that wage-earners who
voted at the primary for delegates to the
Republican convention Intend to vote the
Republican ticket on November .7.
The real surprise of the next election
may be the small Republican vote that
Ruef will throw to Schmitz.
The Republican convention .will meet, at
the Alhambra Theater on Tuesday even
ing, September IS, and y obabl y complete
its work Thursday night, September 2L

flst, '31 rs. \u25a0;. Sullivan was .' helped rto \u25a0 her
fwt only to go to her death.
Desperate in her physical and mental
suffering, she seized -a , bottle .of lysol
and drank deeply of ; the caustic fluid.
An hour later she was Â» dead.',. - And the
husband sought " to conceal "the j truth by
attributing, the thing to accident.
But under the probing. of a severe
judicial inquiry: by Judge William -R. v
Geary, acting Coroner, the - jurors at
the inquest-gained' evidence^upon 1 which
their verdict was rendered*as follows:
We find that . the ' "death of Mrs.
Charles \V. - Sullivan ' was â¢ caused ;~ by
lysol, sd'-odmlnistered * by ' deceased
while suffering:' great â¢ mental agony. ;
MISS GRAU TELLS ALLi
ThS~- scene of, the tragic deaths was
the Sullivan residence, 631 Forty T sixth
street.' -_ The revelation of suicide that
bears so \u25a0 heavily upon the/ husband â¢as
responsible came from the lips of Miss
Jeanette Grau, an . old friend of .Mrs.
Sullivan's and a visitor at the Sullivan
home. â¢ Under ' the" pressure \u25a0of â¢ inquiry
Miss Grau reluctantly unfolded the sad
story^before Judge Geary last night at
the , Sullivan residence, where -the .'in
quest was -held* unannounced.* Miss
Grau resides at 1257; O'Farrell; street,
San . Francisco, and ". is- an employe '\u25a0 of
the' Smith-Premier Typewriter Com
pany "across. the bay.
Dr. . W. S. Kelly, , who was \u25a0 called .to
the house by- Sullivan to_ attend the
young woman,, said he; arrived, about
an hour after she had taken the poison."
She was then dying,- though the hus-"
band did not appear to â¢ realize her con
dition. RBIHriBBHBBBHHBSEBO
"When I told him there was no hope,".
Dr. Kelly testified, "Sullivan broke into
tears \u0084> and . tried ;\u25a0 to ;. arouse : his ." wife,
pleading:^ for forgiveness, jbiitj ,she
passed away without . recovering con
sciousness."
Then Miss Grau, who. had\ seen; much
of the fatal[ trouble, last Sunday, morn
ing,* was called. \u25a0'\u25a0. Her desire ; not ; to fc tell
the sad'story.was manifest. ( But bit by

the tale of Sullivan's brutality.- . â¢' ";
ARRIVES HO3IB \u25a0 LATE.
Miss Grau Â£aid Sullivan arrived home
late Saturday night in a condition! that
caused". his wife r to ;take ! ,hlm" to^task.'
Mrs. Sullivan . threw : away two;. bottles
of whisky her husband had . taken home,'
this angering him ; so* much-. that '^ the
couple had' hot words. Miss Grau con
tinued: .
"In the'morning Mr. Sullivan left the
house, still angry, and-. w.ithout seating
breakfast. He returned about " noon,'
