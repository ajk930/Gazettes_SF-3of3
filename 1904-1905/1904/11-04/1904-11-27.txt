r I HE second lesson in these simple instructions for
1 . the piano-or organ takes up theiiey of G and itSi
1 corresponding key of E minor. Jt is destined: in-,
these lessons to give all of the fundamental
chords used in musical composition. There -will be
twelve lessons, each comprising two charts.
The pupil is expected to learn these chords, so they
can be played almost intuitively. This means prac
tice, practice, practice.
Place this chart at right angles -to the keyboard df
your piano or organ,, so that the small letter D on the
bottom space of the chart touches the white key D on
the keyboard. The other white spaces on the chart will
then be over the white keys and the black spaces over
the black keys. When the lesson at the bottom of .the
page is thoroughly learned turn page over and 7 learn
the top lesson. . . .--
The black letters are played with the right hatid^and
the blue letters at the left are the bassrtind are played
with the left hand.
"When playing chords, commence rat top space and
play blue letter first, and black letters on same-after
ward in chord, making the rhythm desired; then play
the middle space in the same manner, followed by the
bottom space. Eeturn to the top space, forming a com
plement. The small D with the dash above if is only to
indicate its position, and must not b&played. V *
Follow the instructions how to use the chart given
here and you will find in a short time youwill be able to
master these chords.

She saw his passion: his words con
firmed her secret fear. She saw, too,
how In the strese of danger he would
.not .stand on scruples or be balked
by. questions of taste or -of social pro
priety.-He saw possible salvation, and
jumped at any. path to It; and -the re
sponsibility of refusing to tread the
path he put on her, with all it might
mean.
"If I went and he said 'No' you could
-not go afterward. But you can go- first,
and you must go."
Christine raised her head and shook

' "I can't go." she said.
"Why not? You're infernally odd

had to look at him calmly and steadily

money, don't they ? . I don't : see any
thing awful in that. I daren't eo to the
step to avoid what she feared. Hating
it, she would sit/ shivering by the fire,'
and wait for it all the same. She
knew this of herself, and therefore
was even more sorry for John than on
'her own account. This state of mind
made the amiability -. easier. It also
awoke her conscience from a long sleep
with regard to the way in which she
had treated John In the past. Against
this, however, she struggled not only
fiercely, but with a conviction of Jus
tice. Here conscience was overdoing
Its part, and passing from scrupulous
ness to morbidity. The thing in ques
tion, the thing conscience was worrying
about, belonged to the far past; it had
been finished off and written off, en-
Joyed and' deplored,' brooded over and
violently banished from thought, ever
so long ago. Hardly anybody - knew
about It; it was utterly over. Nonethe

very sharply. on the watch; she was on

. "He -was a good, chap, and very fond
of .us. 1 Lord, v we-, had some fine old
times with .Caylesham!", He rose now
and stood with ;his .back 'to the fire.'
"He must be devilish* rich since ' he
came into the property.".
He loked at her inquiringly. She
said nothing'.'- ...
"He's a good. chap, too. I don't
think he'd let a friend go to the wall.
What do vou think? He was as much
your. friend as mine, you know."
"Yon'd.ask him. John? Oh, I should
not do that!" . .,
"Why. not? He's got plenty.";
"We see so little of him now; and

added: . * "I want another fifteen thou

He smoked hard for a minute, then
flung :his cigar peevishly Into the fire.
â¢ "I 'do wish I could help you, .John!"
she sighed.
"I'm afraid , you can't, old lady.",
Again h<s hesitated. "Unless â -" He
broke off again." â¢ Â¦
Christine had some difficulty in keep-
Ing her nerves under control. When he
spoke again it was abruptly, as though
with; a wrench:

now?"' ... ' ; .
A very slight.. Almost imperceptible,
start ran over her. . ' .
Â¦"Grantley always likes to do "the

before she, put her question. "And â
and is that enough?" . -
He was ashamed, it was easy, to see
thatâ ashamed to show her how deep
he was in the bog, how reckless he had
been. He finished his tea, and pottered
about, ctftting and lighting a cigar,
before he answered. / .'.Â¦Â¦Â¦ >
"I suppose it's not enough?" said
Christine. , â¢ . . ".' ; \

â¢ It was Sibylla Imason* whom 3Irs.
Raymore chose to pour out these feel-
Ings to. Who could better share them
than the young wife still in the first
pride and glory of her motherhood?
"Children bring vou together - and
keep you together, whether in trouble
or In Joy. That's one reason why
everybody ought to have children,"
Kate Raymore said with a rather trem
ulous smile. "If there are none, there's
such a danger of the whole thing get
ting old and cold, and â and worn out,
you know."
Sibylla was in wonderful health no w,
and at the best of her Iook3. Her man
ner,- too had grown more ! composed
and less impulsive, although she kept
her old graclousrtesr. To Kate Ray
rnore she seemed very fair and good to
praze on. She listened with a thought
tul gravitv antl the wonted hint of
questlon'ng or seeking In her- eyes.
There was a hint of pain in them, also.
. - "Yes. Ill go."
"There's a brave little woman I" he
cried delightedly, and bent down as If
he would kiss her; but she had slipped
her screen up nearly to her eyea again,
and seemed so unconscious of his pur
pose that he abandoned i*. - His spirits
rose in a moment, as his sanguine
mind, catching hold of the bare chance,
twisted it into a good chance â almost
Into a certainty
"Gad, I bÂ«liÂ«va hell give It. you 1
You'll put it in such a fetching way.
Ob, his money's safe enough, of course!
Butâ well, you'll make him see that
better than I could. He liked you so
much, you know. By Jove, I'm. sure
he'll do it for you. you know!". .
Christine's pain-stricken eyes alonÂ«
werÂ» visible above the screen. Under
neath it her lips were bent, in an in
voluntary smile of most mocking bit
terness. Conscience had not been at
her without a purpose. At her hus
band's bidding she must go and ask
Caylesham for money. She bowed to
conscience now.
CHAPTER VUL
Ideals and Aspirations.
A sudden rigidity seemed to affect
Mrs. Rayroora from the waist upward.
Her back grew stiff, her head rose
very straight from the neck, her eyes
looked fixedly In front of her, her lips
w'ere tight shut. These symptoms were
due to the fact that she saw Tom
Courtland approaching, in- company
with a woman who was certainly
not Lady Harriet. Thanks to . the
gossip about among Tom's friends.
Kate Raymore guessed who - she
was; the- woman's gorgeous attire,
her flamboyant manner, the air of.
good-natured rowdyism which she
carried with her. all confirmed
the guess. Yet Tom was walk-
Ing with her' In the broad light of day
â not in the street, it is true; it was
in a rather retired part of the park.
But people came there and drove by
there, and to many his companion was
known by sight and by repute. His
conduct betrayed- increasing reckless
ness. There was nothing to. do but to
pass him by without notice; he himself
.would wish .nothing else and.rwov^d
expect nothing else. Still Mrs. R1^
more was sorry to have. to do it; S^
Tom had been kind and helpful in. oif
talning that position in a railway 'com
pany's office in. Buenos : Ayres which
had covered the disastrous retreat of
her well-beloved son.
This lamentable affair had been
hushed up so far as the outer world
was concerned; but their friends knew
the truth. In the first terrible days,
when there had been Imminent risk of
a criminal prosecution, Raymore . had
rather lost his head and had gone
round to Grantley Iraason, to Tom
Courtland, to John Fanshaw, making
lament and imploring advice. So they
all knew â they and their wives;, and
the poor bov's sister Eva had been
told, perforce. There the public shame
stopped, but the private shame was
very bitter to the Raymores. Raymore
was driven to acctlse himself of all
kinds of faults In his bringing up of
the boy â of having been too Indulgent
here or too strict thereâ most of all.
of having been so engrossed in busi
ness as not to see enough. of the boy
or to keep proper watch on his dis
position and companions, and thÂ» way
he spent his time. Kate Raymore, who
even now could not get it out of her
head, that her boy was a paragon, was
possessed by a more primitive feeling.
To her the thing was a nemesis. She
had been too content, too sure all. was
well with their household, too uplifted
in her kindly but rather scornful Judg
ment of the difficulties and follies
which the Courtland family and- tha
Fanshaw family and other families of
her acquaintance had brought befors
her eyes. She had fallen too much Into
the pose of the Judge, the critlo, and
the censor. Well, she had trouble
enough of her- own now; and that, to
say nothing of Tom's kindness about
.Buenos Ayres. made her sorrier to have
to cut him in the park. -
She was a religious woman, of a type
now often considered old fashioned.
The nemesjs which she Instinctively ac
knowledged she accepted as a Just and
direct chastisement of heaven. Her
husband was Impatient with. this view,
-but he had more sympathy with tha
merciful alleviation- of her sorrow
which heaven had sent. In the hour
of her affliction her son's heart, which
had wandered from -her In the-way
wardness of his heady youth, had come
back to her. Thev could share holy
memories of hours spent before Charley
went, after forgiveness had been of
fered and received, and they were all
drawn very close together. With these
memories in. their hearts they could.en
dure and with a confident hope look
forward to their son'3 future. Mean
while they who remained were nearer
In heart, too. Eva, who had been.in
clined to fllghtiness, .. was frightened
and sobered into a greater tenderness
and a more willing: obedience; and Ed
gar Raymore himself, when once he
had pulled himself together, had be
haved so wetl and had been such a
help to his wife In the trial that their
old relations of mellow friendship took
on a more intimate and affectionate
character.
"Well, Sibylla, wouldn't believe the
London man. you see. She thought
that heâ that he'd been persuaded to
"I know she â she had an accident"
"Oh, well, everybody knows. Yes,
she had. and they thought It was
worse than It was. The country doc
tor down at Milldean made a mistake
â took too cerlous a view, you know.
And â and there was a lot of bother.
But the London man said it would be
all right; and so It turned out. The
baby came all right, and it's 'a splen
did boy."
"It all ended all right, then?"
Christine looked a little doubtful.
â¢The boy's all right, and Sibylla's
quite well," Bhe answered.
"But mamma said Mrs. Raymore
hlnttfa "
"It's nothing, my dear." said Chris
tine, amused but annoyed; she was
very ready to help Anna, but did not
care in the least for being kissed by
her.
Anna sat down again, and a long
pause ensued.
"And as for not marrying," Chris
tine resumed. 'It's e!x of one and half
a dozen of the other. I think. Oh. I
should have hated to be an old' maid;
but still one would have avoided, so
much worry. Look at these poor
Raymores! They've always got on so
well, too. ud to now!" .
Ehe laid dewn her screen and pulled
up her dress to let the warmth get to
her ankles. Anna looked at her
dainty face lit up by the glow.
- "I wish I was like you, Mrs. Fan
shaw!."
Christine did not refuse the compli
ment; 6he only denied the value of the
possession which won it for her.
"Much good if s done me, my dear!"
she sighed. "But people who've not
grot looks never will believe how little
good they are. Oh, I don't mean to
be rude. Anna! I believe In you, you
know. I can do something with you.
Only " She stopped, frowning a
little and looking vaguely unhappy.
"Well," she resumed, "if it turns out
that I can't take you under my wing,
Â¦we must get hold of Sibylla. She's
always ready to do things for people â
and they've got lots of money, any
how."
Anna's curiosity was turned in the
direction of Sibylla.
"What was the truth about Mrs.
Imr-son, Mrs. Fanshaw?"
. "I made sure you'd know that, too!"
smiled Christine. "And if you don't,
I suppose I oughtn't to tell you."
"Oh, I like dressing people; and I
do think girls ought to have their
chances. But in those things she
makes you wear â oh, my dear Anna!"
"Yes, I know. Ill ask her.
And â¢*
Anna hesitated, then rose and came
over to Christine. Suddenly, she
kissed her.

"Oh, mamma always tells me things
o â r else I hear her and papa talking
about them. When I'm washing the
dogs they forget I'm there, especially
if they're squabbling at all. And I
keep my ears open.
"But generally mamma tells me.
She always must talk to somebody,
you see. When I was little she used
to tell me things and then forget it
and box my ears for knowing them."
Anna spoke without rancour; rather
with a sort of quiet amusement, as
though she had given much study to
her mother's peculiarities and found
permanent diversion in them.
"Poor Kate Raymore! Well, there's
trouble everywhere. Isn't there, An
na?" She shivered and drew yet a
little nearer the fire. "How are things
at home with you?"
"Just as usual; nothing ever hap
pens with us."
"t might be much worse than that."
"I suppose It might. It's only Just
i other dull; and I suppose I shall have
to endure It for a long while. You
see, I'm not very likely to get mari
ried, Mrs. Fanshaw. No men ever
come to our house â they can't stand It.
Besides I'm not pretty."
"Oh, come and meet men here;' and
never mind not being pretty; I could
dress you to look quite smart. That's
it! You should go in for smartness,
not prettiness. I really believe it pays
better nowadays. Get Janet â get your
mother to give you an allowance and
we'll put our heads together ove* it."
"That's awfully kind of you, Mrs.
Fanshaw."
"He used to be a very pretty little
boy. A little boy! And now!" Chris
tine plucked idly at the fringes of her
hand screen.

CIIAFTIIIl VII.
A Vindication of Conscience.
IT was a dull, chilly afternoon In
March. Christine Fawhaw hud
dled her Flight little figure â chs
looked as if the cold would cut
right through her â over a blazing fire
in her boudoir. She hold a screen be
tween the flames and her face and
turned her eyes o;i Anna Selford, who
v&s paying her a call. Anr.a was a
plump, dark girl, by no means pretty,
but with a shrewd look about her and
an air of self-confidence rather too
absurd fcr her years; ehe was dressed
in a would-be artistic fashion, not well
suited to her natural etyle.
"Awfully sad, isn't it?" she was say-
Ing. "But mamma says Mrs. Raymore
is splendid about it. Mr. Raymore was
quite upset and v.as no good at all at
ilrsL It was Mrs. Raymore who went
and got Charley away from the woman
and hushed up all the row about the
money â oh, he had taken some from
the office ; he v.as in a solicitor's of- .
nee. you know â and arranged for him
to be sent out to Buenos Ayres â did
the whole thing in fact. She's quite
heartbroken about it, mamma says,
but quilt- firm and brave, too. How
awful to have your son turn out like
that! He was only 19, and Mrs. Ray
more simply worshiped him."
"We're in the same boat, and we
must both pull at our oars, old girl,"
he said, and Christine was glad he
should say it, although she hated being
called "old girl." John had a tendency
toward plebeian endearments, she
thought.
So the best pair went to Tattersall's,
and some of the diamonds to a corre
sponding establishment in the jewelry
line; and various other things were
done or attempted with the view of
letting free a few thousand pounds
and of diminishing expenditure in the
future. But John Fanshaw's brow
grew no clearer. About these sacrifices
there hung the air of doing what was
right and properâ what, given the
wcrst happening, would commend
itself to the feelings of the creditors
and the Official Receiverâ rather, than
of achieving anything of real service!
Christine guessed that the speculations
must have been on a very large scale
and the commitments very heavy.
Could it be that ruinâ rear ruinâ was In
front of them? She could hardly real
ize that â either its coming or what life
would be after it had come. And In
her heartâ here, too, she had said, no
more than truthâ she did doubt
whether John would stay in the world
to see. Well, what, could Bhe do?" She
had three hundred a year of her own;
tied up and (since they had no chil
dren) could find crusts for herself and
Johnâ if John were; there. These were
the thoughts which had kept; intrud
ing Into her mind as she talked to
Anna Selford and shivered now- and
then over the blazing. fire. -Yet she
could face them better than John,
thanks to a touch. of fatalism in her
nature. She would think of no .violent
"Anna! John would cut his throat
first. Oh, I really believe, he would!
You've no Idea what a man like mm
thinks of his business and of his firm's
credit. .It's likeâ well. It's like what
we women ought j to think (again
Christine avoided asserting the actual
fact) about our reputations, you know.
So you may imagine the state of
things. The best pair is being sold
at Tattersall's this very day. ' â¢ That's
why I'm Indoors â cabs are so cold, and
the other pair will have to go out at
night."
Shiveringly she nestled to the fire
again. .
"I'm awfully sorry, Mrs. Fanshaw
It'll all come right, won't' it?"
"It generally does; but I don't know."
And John savs I've always been so
extravagant â and I suppose I have.
Well, I thought it was Just that John
was stingy. He had a splendid busi
ness, you know." She paused and
smiled at. Anna,' "So now you know
all of everybody's troubles," she
ended.
Christine was not In the habit of
giving praise beyond measure or with
out reservation either to herself or to
other people, 1 and she had done ' lo
more than Justice to her present ef
fort to be amiable. Money was the
old cause of quarrel between her hus
band and herself; the alternation of fat
and lean years had kept it always alive
and intermittently active. But hitherto
while the fat seasons had meant af
fluence* the lean had never fallen short
of plenty or solvency. It had been a
question of more or less lavish expen
diture, that was all. Christine .was
afsaid there was more now. Her hus
band was worried as he had I never
been before: he had dropped hints of
speculations gone wrong and of hravy
commitments; and Christine, a con
stant dancer at city articles and an
occasional dabbler in stocks, had read
that there was a crisis in the market
in which he mainly dealt. Things were
black: she knew it almost as well. as
he. Both showed courage and the seri
ousness of the matter forba i* mere
bickering. Nor was either Invulner
able enough to open the battle. Htr
extravagance exposed her to attack;
he was conscious of hazardous specu
lations which had wantonly under
mined the standing, and now threat
ened the credit, of a firm once strong
and of excellent reoute. Each needed
at once to give and to receive charity.
Thus from the Impending trouble they
had become better friends, and ' their
underlying comradeship had more
openly asserted itself. This amount of
good there was in it, Christine thought
to herself; and John, In his blunt fash
ion, had actually said as much to her.
"Then why don't <you?"
"Yes, I ought to know that, living
in our house," remarked Anna Selford.
"You do give your parents away
so!" Christine complained, with a
smile in which pity was mingled..
The pity, however, was not for* the
betrayed, but for the traitor. Anna's
premature knowingness and the sug
gestion of hardness it carried with it
were the result of a reaction against
the atmosphere of her home, against
the half real gush and the spasmodic
emotionality of the family circle. In
this revolt truth asserted Itself, but
sweetness suffered and freshness lost
its bloom. Christine was sorry when
that sort of thing happened to young
girls. But there it was. Anna was not
the ingenue and it was no good treat
ing her as if she were.

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALI1
DOUBLE HARNESSDirectly Christine came in. he no
ticed how pretty and dainty and young
she looked; at least she pleased him
still. He greeted her with great cor
diality and with no embarrassment.
and made her sit down In a chair by
the fire. She was a little pale, but he
did not observe that: what he noted â
and noted with a touch of unusement
â was that she met his eyes as seldom
u3 possible.
. "I really couldn't think to what I
owed this pleasure '* he began.
But she interrupted him.
"You couldn't possibly have guessed.
I've got to tell you that.**
"It's not these?"
He. held -.up the letters In their en
velope.
"Whaf are they?"
"Only two or three notes of yours â
all I've got. I think."
"Notes of mine? Ob, put them la the
fire! It wasn't that."
"I suppose we may as well put them
in the fire," he agreed.
A3 the fire burned up the letters,
Christine looked at the fire and said:
"John has sent me here."
"John 'sent you here?"
He jwas : surprised, and again per
haps a trifie amused.
"You don't suppose I should have
come of my own accord? I hate com
ing." -
"Oh, don't say that! "We're always
friends, always friends. But suppose
you insist on â¢hating* to come â well,
â¢why have you come?**
She looked at him now.
Christine suffered his kissâ a cere
mony not usual to their daily parting
in the morning. When he had gone
she sat on a long white behind the tea
things at the breakfast table, deep in
thought, trying to picture the. work of
the day which lay before her. It was
extraordinarily hateful to her and she
ha'd hardlv been able to endure John's
jocularity and his talk about pretty
women coming to call.
Because there had once been some
talk she had told Caylesham that she
would bring a friend with her, naming
Anna Selford. Anna would go in with
her and wait in another room while
they had their meeting. Caylesham
thought this rather superfluous, but
had no objection to make. He could
not form any idea why she was com
ing, until it occurred to him that per
haps he had a few letters of hers some
where and that women are apt to get
frights about letters, picturing sudden
deaths and not remembering that a
wise man chooses a discreet ex
ecutor. With this notion in his
head he hunted about and did find two
or three letters. But they were quite
harmless; in order to fee this he read
them through, and then laid them
down with a smile. After a few mo
ments of reflection he put them into
an envelope, sealed them up, and
placed them on the table by him ready
for Christine. He was- a man of forty
five, and he looked it. But he was tall,
thin, well set up, and always exceed
ingly well turned out. Beyond his rank
and his riches, his only fame lay in
sporting circles. He and John Fan
shaw had first made acquaintance
over horses, and he still went in for
racing on a considerable scale.- He was
unmarried, and likely to remain so.
There was a nephew to inherit: and he
had pleased himself so much that he
Â¦found. It hard to please himself any
more now. And he had. unlike Walter
Blake, no aspirations. He had a code
of morals, and a very strict onev so
far as it went; but it was not co-ex
tenslve with more generally recognized
codes.
"All risht. To-day's Thursday. I'll
go to Lady Harriet on Sunday. Not
much harm can happen in three days.
Good by, old girl, and â and good luck!"
But it was not hard to see how en
tirely he built all his trust on this
last remaining chance. He rose from
thÂ» breakfast table.
"Ha, ha! Well, I suppose a fellow
generally does answer cordially when
a pretty woman proposes to call on
him. Ha, ha!" John's hop-ii made him
merry and jovial. "I say. I shall get
back as early as.. I can from the city
and try to be here in time to welcome
ycu. And if '?â¢- gone all right, whyâ'*
"Don't let yourself be too sure."
"No, I won't. Oh, no, I won't do
that!"
"Wei!. I'll go on Sunday." he said
at last, and added, with a look across
the table: "Perhaps some of my own
troubles will be off my mind by then.
Christine flushed a little.
"Oh. I hope so." she said rather for
lornly.
"I do hope so." he declared emphati
cally. "1 build great hones on it. It
Is to-day you're going.- isn't it?"
"Yes, to-day. After lunch, I said I'd
come."
"Did he write back cordially?"
"Well, what could the poor man do,
John?"
"Look her* if she can be got to
express regret and hold out the olive
branch you know, will you drop all
this and give the thing one more trial?"
It was a favorable moment for the
request, since Tom happened to be
cross with his pleasures too â they were
bo very expensive, ne allowed himself
to be persuaded to say yes.
But who was to beard Lady Harriet
in her den? There was no eagerness
to undertake the task: yet every body
a greed that a personal interview was
the only chance. Grantley fairly
"funked it." and honestly said so. Ray
more's nerves were stilt so upset that
his excuses were acceptedâ it was mor
ally certain that Harriet, if she be
came angry, would taunt him about
his boy. Selford? That was absurd.
And it was not a. woman's work. The
lot fell on John Fanshaw-Voha, with
his business prestige and high reputa
tion for common sense*. And Lady Har
riet liked him best of them ail. The
choice was felt to be excellent by
everv one â except John himself.
"Haven't I enough worries of my
own?" he demanded. "Why the devil
am I to take on Tom Courtland's. too?"
"Oh. do try! It can't hurt you if she
does tiy into a passion.. John."
He grumbled a great deal more; and
Christine, in an unusually chastened
mood, performed the wifelv function
pf meeting his grumbles with mingled
consolation and praise.
Harriet amenable! Good Lord!"
Efforts were on foot to avert the
scandal and public disaster which so
imminently threatened the Courtlands.
Grantley Imason. who had a real
friendship for Tom. interested himself
in them. Not merely the home was in
danger but Tom's position and career,
also Tom's solvency. He had always
lived ut> to his income; now, without
doubt, he was spending sums far be
yond it; and, as has been seen, the
precautions which he had declared he
would use were falling into neglect as
the sense of hopelessness grew upon his
mind. From such neglect to blank
effrontery and defiance looked as
though it would be but a short step.
And he refused obstimAely to make
any advances to his wife; he wouia
not hear of suing for peace.
"My dear fellow, think of the chil
dren!" Grantley urged.
Poor Tom often thought of the chii
dren and often tried not to. He knew
very well where he was going ana
what his goins there must mean ti>
them. Yet he held on his way, obsti
nately assuring himself that the fault
for which they must suffer was not
his.
"I do think of them, butâ it was past
bearing, Grantley."
"I think you must have given her a
real fright by now. Perhaps she'll be
more amenable."
A Successful Mission.
CHAPTER IX.
neither talked to intimate friends nor
invited questions from them. Both
pride and wisdom forbade. Finally,
while he acknowledged great discom
fort (including a disagreeable element
of the ludicrous), the idea of danger
never crossed his mind; he would
have laughed at Christine Fanshaw's
warning had it been addressed to him.
Whatever Sibylla's faults, levity was
not among them, and danger in Chris
tine's sense â danger of a break-up of
the household, as distinguished from a
continuance of it, however unsatisfac
tory that continuance might be^ â there
would probably have been none, had
not Walter Blake, after a lively but
not very profitable youth, wanted
to' reform his life. He might
have wanted to be wicked with
out creating: anv peril at all for the
Imason household. But he wanted to
be good, and he wanted SIbvlla to
make him good. This idea had occur
red to him quite early in their ac
quaintance. He, too, had a faculty
â even a facility â for idealizing. He,
idealized Sibylla into the image of
iroodness and purity, which would turn
him from sin and folly by making vir
tue and wisdom not better (which of
course they were already), but more
attractive and more pleasurable. If
they were made more attractive and
more pleasurable he would be eager
to embrace them. Besides he had had
a good deal of the alternatives without
ever being really content with them.
By this time he was firmly convinced
that he must be good,- and that Sibylla
ar.d Sibylla* alone could make him
by malice. "So if I've been imperti
nent, just put it down to what I hap
pen to be thinking about."
' Sibylla stood very quiet, saying noth
ing-. Christine went on after a minute:
"Can't you manage to be wrapped
cp ir^ the baby?"
"No, I can't." The answer was hard
and unhesitating. "You've told me
something people don't generally tell.
I'll tell you something that I didn't
think I should ever telL I love my
bat"- â ard sometimes I hate to have to
see him." Her eyes were on Christine's
face, and there was distress â hopeless
distress â In them. "Now I should
think you'd drop my acquaintance,"
she ended with a laugh.
"Oh, I've never had a babyâ I'm not
shocked to death. Butâ but why, Si
bylla?"
"Surely, you can g^iess why! It's
horrible, but it's not unintelligible.
surely?"
"No, I suppose It's not," Christine
sighed.
Christine's legs had been curled up
on her chair; she let them down to the
ground and rose to her feet.
-"That's all from both of us for to
day?" she asked, with a wry smile.
"All for to-day, I think," answered
Sibylla, buttoning her glove.
"I meant to beâ friendly."
"You have been. I never guessed
anythingâ anything of what you've
said â about you."
"Nobody iinted it? Not even Harriet
Courtland? â¢ She knew." >
"I nev' Â«*"Â» her. How did she
know?"
Thns far the first stasre. The next
was not reached. There was plenty
of time yet. Sibylla loved the child.
Blake had set up his Idol, but he had
not yet declared that he was the only
devotee who knew how properly to
honor and to worship it.
He sat watching Sibylla as she play
ed with her baby boy. He took a hand
in the game now and then, since, for
a bachelor, he was at his ease with
babies; but most of the time he watch
ed. -But he watched sympathetically;
Sibylla did not fear to show her love
before his eyes. The babv was very
young for sames â for any that a man
could play. But Sibylla knew some
that he nked: he gave evidence of a
strangely dawning pleasure distinct
from Dhyaical contentmentâ of wonder.
which it is heldâ which things, again,
depend on the character and temper
of the believer. Sibylla's character and
temper made the proposition extraordi
narily convincing-. Her circumstances,
as she conceived them, were equally
provocative in the same direction.
What was wrong with her? In the
end that she was not wanted, or not
wanted enough, that she had more to
give than had been asked of her, and
had no outlet (as Christine had put it)
sufficient to relieve the press of her
emotions. It was almost inevitable
'that she should respond to Blake's ap
peal. He was an outlet. He was some
body who wanted her very much,
whom she could help, wlth*vrhbm she
could expand, to whom she could give
what she had to give in such abundant
measure.
Was not this the real, the great
thing? Blake's - mind, disengaging
from the past memories of what had
once been its delights, and turning
now in distaste from them, declared
that it was. Nature had the secret of
the keenest pleasureâ It was to be
found along nature's way. Tr
pleasure was true to a, purpose, achiev
ing a great end, concentrated on that,
not dissipated in passing and unfruit
ful jcys. Blake was sure that he was
right now, sure that he wanted to be
reformed, more sure than ever that
wisdom and virtue were more pleasur
able (as well as being better) than
their opposites. A man of ready sen
sibility and quick feeling, he was open
to the suggestion and alive to the
beauty of what he saw. It seemed to
him holyâ and the feelings It evoked
in him seemed almost holy. too. "Moth
erhood!", he said to himself, not know
ing, at least not acknowledging, that
his true meaning was. this woman as
mother, motherhood incarnate in her.
Yet that it was. If his aspirations
were awake, his blood, too. was stirred.
But the moment for that to come to
light was not yet. The good seemed
still unalloyed, his high-soaring aspi
rations were guiltless of self-knowl
edge.
Sibylla played with the child till she
could play no more â till she feared to
tire him. she would have saidâ In- truth
till the* tenderness which, had found a
mask in the sport would conceal Its
face no more, and in a *Dasm of love
The soell was broken. What hadjt
been and why was it dispelled? BlaES
did not know, but turgid feelings min
gled with his aspirations now and he
looked at Grantley Imason with a new
covert hostility.
"Look h>re. I shall attend to your
official message. I shar/t take any no
tice of these private communications.'*
he said Hzhtiy. bat kindly, almost af
fectionately. "And you mustn't fee!
that sort of way about it. Why. Tve
got a right to help you. anyhow: and I
can't see why I mustn't help John."
He went to the table and wrots-T He
carr" back to her holding a check in
his hand.
"Here it Is." he said. "Joha will
send D3Â«* a letter embodying the busi
ness side. I've post-dated the check
four days, because I must gee my
bankers about it. Oh, It's not tnccnve-
He shrugged his shoulders in a dis
creet evasion, seeing the threatened
opening of a discussion of a sort al
ways painful and useless.
"John will take failure and an that
devilish bard."
H took up the paper again and
looked at it. He knew the business
was a very gocd one; after such a
warning as this the man would
surely go steady; and Grantley
Imason had lent money. He built
a good deal on that. Andâ yesâ
in the end he was ready to run
a risk, being- a good-natured man
and fond of John, and feeling that it
would be a very becoming thing in
him to <Jo a service to> John.
"You're cot a very, trustworthy ein
bassador." he said, smiling. "I don't
think you're playing fair with Joha,
you know."
"Why do you â you â expect me to?**
she asked bitterly.
He was puzzled stilL He could not
get down to the root of her objection;
and she could not, or would not. put
it plainly to him. She cosid not ex
press the aspect of the affair that was.
as she said, so terribly hateful to her.
But it was there, All she had given
she had given long ago â given freely
long ago. Now was she not asking a
price for it â and a price which her
husband wa3 to share? Only on that
ground really was she there. For now
the man loved her no more; there was
no glamor and no- After all
these years she came back and asketl
a price â a price John was to share.
But the case did not strike Cayles
ham at all like this. John suspected
nothing-, or John would not have sent
his wife there. John had been a very
good friend: he would like to do John
a good torn. In his case the very cir
cumstances which so revolted Chris
tine made him more inclined to do Joha
a good turn. Although he could not
pretend that the affair had ever mad*
him uncomfortable, still Its existence
in the past helped John's cause for him
now. Â¦- m^- Â¦Â¦Â¦-
"Is he expecting to get it?"
"I don't think that has anything to
do with it. I suppose â well drownins
men catch at straws."
She smiled dolefully.
The phrase was unlucky for her pur
pose. It stirred Caylesham's pity.
"Poor oM John!" he murmured
again. "Whafll he do if he doesn't
get it?" 4 t | -Â«JQ
"I don't know â I told you I didn't
know."
Caylesham made a wry little grim
ace. That might be true of John,
but he would hesitate to say the same
about every fellor.-. Christine, however,
did not see the grimace.
"And you don't want me to lend it â
not tho-ugh it means all this to John?"
"I don't want you to lend it. what
ever it means. Pray don't lend it.
Frank!"
"Is that Well, I don't quite know
how to put it. I mean, is that oa
John's account or on your own?"
"I can't give you reasons; I can't
put them iii words. It's Just terribly
hateful to me."
He was puzzled by the point of view
and still more by finding it in her.
Perhaps the last six years had made a
difference in her way of looking at
things; they had made none in his.
"And if I do as *-ou wish, what are
you going to say to John? Are yc-u
goins to say to him that in the end
you told me not to lend the money?"
"Of course not. I shall say that yuu
said you cc-uldn't; you'll have to give
rnt- the reasons."
He ioked discontented.
"I'll look rather shabby." he sug
gested.
"Oh. no! It's a large sum. It wouM
be quite likely that it wouldn't be con
venient to you."
"And now- 1 have to speak on my own
account. Frank, yuu must rind some
good, some plausible, reason for refus
ing. You mustn't lend John the
money."
"Hallo:**
"You see, Jehn doesn't know tha
truth," she answered.
He rose and stood by the fire, look
ing down on her thoughtfully.
"No, oÂ£ course he doesn't, or â or you
wouldn't be here." he said, after a
pause.
Then he fell into- thought again.
"And if he did know, he'd never ask
you for the money," she said.
He wrinkled his brow over the paper
again.
"Yea, yes. that's all right. Don't
distress yourself, Christine. I just want
to have another look at this paper,
and to think it oÂ«r a little. It Is a
goodish bit of money, you know. But
then old John's always been a good
friend of mine, and if times weren't so
uncommon bud "
"FranK," she said. "I've done what I
had to do. what I promised, to. I've
shown you the paper; I've told you
how much this money means to us;
I've told you it means avoiding ruin
and bankruptcy and all that di3grace.
That's what John made me promise
to tell you. and it's all I have to tei!
you from him. iSre done what I said
I would on his behalf."
"Fifteen thousand! It's a bit cf
money!" This remark recalled Chris
tine's thoughts. "Has Imason lent him
that?"
"Yes. on the same terms that he sug
gests there."
"Well, Imason'a a good fellow, but
he's a banker, and â well, I should think
he expects to get i: back. 1 say, John's
been^ having a bit of a plunge, eh?
Consequently he's in Â«l_ep water now?
Is he very much cut up?"
"Terribly: It means ruin, and the
loss of his reputation, and â oh, I don't
know what besides!"
"Pc-or old John! He's a good chap,
isn't he?"
She made no answer to that, and he
muttered:
"Fifteen thousand!"
'N'o, no, not in the least. He only
thought you were â that you liketi
pretty women." She held out- a piece
of p;iper. "He's put it all down there.
I think I'd better give it to you. It
says what he wants, and when he musi
have it, and how he'll pay it back. I
promised to tell you all that, but you'd
better read it for yourself."
He took the paper from her and stud
led it. She looked rc-und the room,
which she had known very welL It
was quite unchanged. Then she
watched him whlie he read. He had
grown older, but he had not lost his
attractiveness. Fcr a moment or two
she forgot the present state of things.
"I suppose he hated it, too. He has
done u once. I mean, he's been to
Grantley Imason. And â and he
thoughtâ you'd be more likely to do it
if I asked."
"Did he'.' Does that mean â "
"I couldn't help it. I refused at first,
but Iâ I had no reason to give If I'd
gone en refusing. He'd have â sus
pected."
"Ah!"
The explanation drew an under
standing cod from him.
"So I came. He's sent me to borrow
money from you."
"To borrow money? What, is

wants a lot of money at once."
"But why didn't he come himself?

Sibylla. "Butâ -.veil, the Courtlands

iicsociated with the hint of pain in *

Best on describing family life on the
true lines â she wouldn't have it that
they were unreal or merely ideal â and
was quite content that Sibylla should
listen.
Sibylla did listen; it was easier to do
that, ihan to talk on the subject her
self. But she listened without much
interest. It was old ground to her,
broken by imagination, if not by ex
perience â very familiar to her thoughts
some months before. She had lived

ideas in the early days of her marriage.
beiore the accident and all that had
COSM from it. The things Kate Ray
more said were no doubt true some
times; but they mere nc-t true for her.
That R-as the upshot of the matter.
Ihey were not true for Grantley Ima-
EOit's wife, nor for the mother of his
child. Her reason, dominated by emo
tion and almost as impulsive as its
ruler, had brought her to that con
clusion before ever her child was born.
It dated from the night when she
battled with Grantley. and she^had
never wavered in it since. She had
abandoned hope of the ideal.
What of that? Do not most people
have to abandon the ideal? Many cf
ihcm Co it readily enough, even with
a secret sense of relief, since there is
cJways something c-f a strain cbout an
ideal; it is, in famous phrase, so cate
Â£cric*iiy imperative. But Sibylla was
a ttickier for ideais; they were what
she dealt in, nrh&i she proposed to bar
ter and to bargain with; she had no
place in her stock for humbler wares.
Ideals or nothing! And, in the Ideal,
wilehorxl and- motherhood were so in
ciissolubly united that the failure of
one soured her joy in the other. She
loved the little child, but loved him
with bitterness. He had become the
symbol cf her lost ideal.
But she did not say this to Kate
Ra.ymore, fur with the loss of the ideal
comes a certain shame of it. We see
it then <Â±s we did not before, as we
knew t.o\v that others â so many oth
ers â see it; and vie veil the broken im
age. Tfct: ' heart, once its throne, be
comes its hiding-place.
All this was not for Kate Raynaore.
She must be left to wonder that Si
bylla said so little about her baby â
left to be amazed at an apparent
coldness m the young motherâ left to
ir.;ss gracious extravagances of mater
nal joy and pride. For if Sibylla could
not be open, neither would she play the
hypocrite by parading a light-hearted
enjoyment and exultation in the child.
Hcw should she display the boy and
her proud pleasure in him to the world
outside, when her pleasure was not
shared at home, and her pride made
her leve covert there? .
Christine Fanshaw, sharply guessing,
had cried once:
"But surely Grantley's manner is ir
reproachable?"
Even now Sibylla's humor rose at the
challenge.
"Yes, irreproachable. Of course it
would be. All through, his solicitude
for both of us was â beautiful: Even
Murr.ples was shaken!"
â¢Shaken? Why, I thought "
"Shaken in her ba.d opinion. I mean.

Christine enjoyed a distinction; she
Icughed gently.
"And you're a very lucky womm,"
eh*- went on.
"Don't I say so in my prayers?**
"If a very dangerous state of mind."
Christine's eyes were set on her
friend. Sibylla met them full and
square. Her mirth, real or affected,
vanished. She looked hard at Chris
tine, and made no answer for a mo
ruent.
"Yes. I suppose I know what you
mean by that," she said at last.
"It's so much easier to despair of
your husband than of anybody else in
the worldâ except your wife."
"I try tii consider him a type."
I**WeIL, don't find an exception. Oh.
I'm not talking at random. I know'.**
She paused a moment and then went
on: "There's a question I should like
to ask you. but I suppose it's a ques
tion nobody ought to ask; it's too im
pertineat even for me. I'm afraid."
SibylLa looked at her and a faint
touch of color rose on her cheeks.
Thtre was a little defiance about her
manner, as though she were accused,
and etood on her defense rather uneas
ily. She understood what question it
was that even Christine could not ask.
"Grantley and I are â perfectly good
friends." she said.
Christine's next question was drawled
out in a lazy murmur, and was never
completed, apparently from mere indo
lence. ,
"It's you who V
Sibylla nodded in an abrupt decisive
fashion.

The color deepened a little on Si

"I reallv think you have, rather, and

It might lead. He had never planned

Ing he did not consider the question
much. How she was to reform him he
seemed to leave to Sibylla, but his
demand that she should do it grew
more and more explicit. \
This was to attack Sibylla>on , her
weak spot, to' aim an arrow true at
the joint in her harness. For (one is
tempted to say, unfortunately) she
knew the only way in which peeple
could be reformed and made good, and
caused to feel that .wisdom and virtue
were not only better (which of course
they felt already), but also more pleas
urable- than folly and sin. (People
who want to be reformed. are some
times, It must be admitted, a little exf
acting.) That could be done /only by
sympathy and understanding. And If
they are thorough, sympathy and un

accounting for it. Add thereto Sibylla's
extreme expectations of a world and
of an institution both of which deal
mostly with compromises and arrange
ment* short of the ideal, and the case
seemed to him clear enough and not
altogether unnatural, however vexa
tious it might be. He flew to no trag
ical or final conclusion. He did not
despair; but neither did he struggle.
He made no advances; his pride was
too -rounded and his reason too - af
fronted for that. On the other hand
he offered no provocation. The â¢ Irre"

the inaccessibility of his feelings in

Most likely it was only that. But the
pity was poignant, and he wondered
â¢vaguely.
They were thus, she and the child
locked together, the young man dimly
picturing . the truth as he watched,
when Grantley Imason came in. A
start ran through Sibylla; she caught
a last kiss from the little face, and
then laid her baby down. Swiftly she
turned round to her husband. Blake
had risen, watching still â nay, more
eagerly. For all he could d. h)s eyes

But how well she knew what Anna
meant and felt! And now she was a
trifle uneasy. Had any of that talk
filtered through leaky Selford conver
sations to Anna's eagerly listening
ears?
"Mamma once told me he'd been
very, very wild."
"Stuff! They always say that about
a man if he's a bachelor. Sheer fem
inine spite. In my belief, Anna!"
"What did you go to see him about?
Oh. is It a secret?"
Christine was really rather glad to
hear the question. It showed that noth
ing very much of the talk had filtered.
And the had her story ready.
Oh, about a horse. You know we've
had to sell our bays and he's got one
that we thought we could buy cheap.
John was so busy that I went. But,
alas. It's beyond us .after all."
"Yes, you told me you'd sold a pair."
Anna nodded significantly.
Christine smiled. She was reflecting
how many crises of life demand a de
parture from veracity and what art re
sides in the choice of a He. the had
chosen one which, implying that Anna
was in her confidence, pleased and
quieted that young woman and sent
her off home without any suspicions
as to the visit or its connection with
the financial crisis otherwise than
through the horses.
She did not ask Anna in to tea be
cause John would be there, home early
from the city, waiting. Now that the
"I won't help you there; our alli
ance is only on the subject of frocks."
Christine reiterated her belief to that
ttYect. It was a melancholy comfort
to poor Anna,
"Suppose I'd been going to see Lord
Caylesham dressed like this!"
"My dear, he's old enough to be your
Tather."
"That doesn't matter. He's so smart
and cood looking. I see him riding
sometimes with Mr. Imason, and he's
just the sort of man I admire. I know
I should fall In love with him."
Christine laughed, but turned her
face a little away.
"It doesn't give me a fair chance,"
lamented Anna; "because I should pay
for dressing, shouldn't I, Mrs. Fan
shaw?"
I detest fads." she said severely.
Christine felt very tired, but she was
not going to give way to that; Anna
Selford was too sharp-witted. She
chatted gaily as they drove home,
mainly about the subject which grieved
ihem both so much â Mrs. Selford's
taste in frocks! Matters were in
an even more dire way now; Anna
could get no frocks. Between pic
tures and dogs, she declared, her
wardrobe stood no chance. Chris
tine was genuinely unable to compre
hend such a confusion or relative im
portance.
She gave him her hand. Her lips
trembled, but she smiled at him now.
"Good-by, Frank. If I have any
hard thoughts, they won't be about
you. You can always" â 5he hesitated
a minuteâ "always disarm criticism,
can't you?"
Caylesham stooped and kissed her
hand lightly. Â¦ :
"Don't fret, my dear." he said.
"You're better than most by a long
way. Now take your check off to poor
old John, and both of you be as Jolly
as you can." He pressed her hand
cordially and led her to the door. "I'm
glad we've settled things all, right.
Good-by."
She shook her head at him, but still
she could not help smiling as she said
her last good-by. With the turning of
her face the smile disappeared.
Caylesham's smile lasted longer. He
stood on his hearthrug, smiling as he
remembered; and an idea which forced
its way into his head did not drive
away the smile. He wondered whether
by any chance old John had any vague
sort ofâ well, hardly suspicionâ but
some vague sort of an inkling. He
would not have hinted that to Chris
tine, since evidently she did not believe
it. and it might have upset her. But
re-ally, in the end, was it rot more odd
to send Christine if he had had no
inkling at all than if he had Just some
sort cf an idea that here was a rea
son why her request might be very
much more potent than his own? He
was inclined to think that John sus
pected Just a flirtation. The notion
made him considerably amused at John,
but not at all angry with him. It was
not' a thing he would have done him
self, perhaps. Still you never can tell
what you will do when you are In a
really tight corner. His racing experi
ences had presented him with a good
many cases which supported this con
clusion.
"What's the use of brooding?" he
asked. "I mean, If you're running
Btraight now, ifs no good being re
morseful and that sort of thing; It
Just wears you out. It would make
you look old. if anything could. But I
don't believe anything could, you
know."
He grew a little impatient at that,
but Etlll he was quite good natured
about it.
nient; only needs a few days' notice â
and it'll be in time for what John
wants. Here, take it, Christine."
He pressed the check into her hands,
and with a playful show of force shut
her fingers upon it.
"I know this has been aâ a " He
looked around the room, ' seeming to
seek an apt form of expression. "This
has been an uncomfortable Job for you,
but you really mustn't look at it like
that, you know."
"If you give it me. I must take it. I
daren't accept the responsibility of re
fusing it."
He was quite eager to comfort her.
â¢You're doing quite right. You frere
perfectly square with me; now you're
being perfectly square with John."
Perfectly square with John! Chris
tine's lips curved in a smile of scorn.
Butâ well, sometimes* one loses the
right or the power to be perfectly
square.
"And I'm downright glad to help
downright glad you came to me."
"I only came because I couldn't
help It."
"Then Tm downright glad you could
not help it_"
She bad loved this unalterably good
temper of his, and admired the tactful
way he had of humoring women. If
they wouldn't have it in one way he
had always been quite ready to offer It
to them in the other, so long as they
took it In the end; and this they gen
erally did. She rose to her feet, hold
ing the check in her hand.
"Your purse, perhaps V he suggested,
laughing. "You see. It might puzzle
your young friend. And give old John
my remembrances â and good luck to
him. Are you going now?"
"Yes, Frank. I'm going now."
"Good-by, Christine. I often think
of you, you know. I often remember â
ah. I see. I mustn't often remember!
Well, you're right, I suppose. But I'm
always your friend. Don't be in any
trcuble without letting me know."
"I chall never come to you again."
Even Caylesham would have allowed
that he had no suspicion. But Chris
tine sat a prÂ«y to vague forebodings.
She felt as though the thing were not
finished yet. The dead would not
bury its dead.
"By Jove, he Is a good sort!" John
suddenly sprang up. "It means salva
tion!" he cried. "That's what it means
âsalvation! I can pay my way. ..I can
look people in the face. I shan't bring
the business to ruin and shame. Oh.
I've had my lessonâ I go steady now!
And If I don't pay these good chaps
every farthing, call me a scoundrel!
They are good chaps, Grantley and old
Caylesham â devilish good chaps!" *
"Don't go quite off your head, John,
dear. Try to take It quietly." v
"Ah, you take it quietly enough, don't
you, old girl?" he exclaimed, coming
up to her. "But you've done it all
yes, by heaven, you have! I know you
didn't like it; I know you hated it.
You're so proud, and I like that in you,
too. But It wasn't a time for pride,
and you put yours In your pocket for
my sake â yes. for my sake, I know it.
We've had our rows, old girl, but if
ever a man had a good wife in the end,
I have, and I know it"
He caught hold of her hands and
pulled her to her feet, drawing her
toward him at the same time.
"Quietly. John," she said, "quietly."
"What, don't you want to give me a
kiss?" ' '
"I'll give you a kiss, but quietly.
Poor old John!"
She kissed him lightly on the cheek.
"Now let me go. Iâ I'm tired."
"Well, you shall rest," he said good
natured'y, and let her go.
She sank back in \ her seat and
watched him turn to the check again.
"It's salvation!" he repeated, and
paid no heed to a sudden quick gasp
of breath from her throat.
She came to him and rave him the
check. He put it on the table and rest
ed his head on his arm. He seemed
almost dazed; the stiffness had gone
out of his body.
"By Jove, he's a good sort! By Jove,
he is a good sort!" he murmured.
"He'Svas very kind indeed. He made
no difficulties. He said he was sure
he could trust you and was glad to
help you. And he sent his remem
brances and good Inck to you, John."
She had taken off her fur coat and
her hat as she was speaking, and now
sank down Into a chair.
"No," she said, opening her purse,
"I haven't failed. Here's a check from
Lord Caylesham. It's post dated, but
only a dav or two. That doesn't mat
ter?"
thing was done she was minded to
make as light of it as possible. Since
she had been compelled to go let John
forget under what pressure and how
unwillingly she had gone. Thus the
faintest breath of suspicion would be
less likelv to rest on her secret. She
trusted her self -control; she would
chaff him a little before she told him
of the succes3 of her mission.
But the first sight of his face drove
the Idea out of her head. It might be
safer for her; It would actually be not
safe for him. She was convinced of
this when she saw the strain In his
eyes and how his whole figure seemed
in a tension of excitement. She closed
the door carefully behind her.
"Well," he cried, "what news* By
God, I've been able to do no work! I
haven't been able to think of anything
else all day. Don'tâ don't say you've
failed!"
framed her conduct, getting thereby
a spice of excitement and a fearful Joy
which no duly licensed encounters
could have given her. ' But she had
doubt that Mrs. Hutting was quite
right. Anna Selford's critical attitude
toward her parents was riot * in j the
rectory way. â¢ Â¦_
"Suppose she'd seen us," Dora whis
pered behind the barn, as the rectory
pony chaise rolled slowly by.
"We're doing nothing wrong. I
should like to walk straight out and
say so."
"If you do, I'll never speak to you
again."
"I hate thisâ this dodging!"
i "Then why don't Â¦ you take your
walks' the other way? -You know I
come here. Why do you come if you
feel like that about it?
Thus Dora fleshed her maiden sword.
Jt was an added Joy- to make Jeremy
do things' which he disliked. And all
this time she was snubbing him and
his tentative approaches. Lovers? Cer
tainly notâ or, of course, she would
have told mamma! Accepted Jeremy?
Noâ sho liked to think that she was
trifling with him. In fine, she was
simply behaving shamefully badly, in
a rapturously delightful way; and to
see a pretty girl doing that is surely
a refreshing and rejuvenating sight?
Well, the word pretty Is perhaps a
. concession to Jeremy. The only girl
In the place Is. always pretty. Dora
was at any rate fresh and fair, lithe
and clean-limbed, gay. and full of fun.
A dreadful peril threatened, v "with
which Dora appalled her own fancy
and Jeremy's troubled heart. At sev
enteen school Is still possible â a finish
ing school. Mrs. Hutting had . bran- â¢
dished this weapon, conscious in her
own mind that the rectory finances '.
would hardly suffice to put an edge
on It. Dora did not realize this diffi
culty.
"You remember that time we were
seen? Well, there was an awful row,
and mamma said that If it happened
once again I should go â for a year!"
Jeremy felt that something must be
done, and said so. ; Â»
"What could I do?" *?
That was a little more difficult for
"You must take pains to avoid me,"
said Dora, schooling her lips to prim
ness. "You don't want to get me sent
away, do you?"
Certainly these spring months were
very pleasant to Miss Dora. But, alas!
calamity came. It happened in Mill
dean just as it might . have happened
in the West End of London. The
school teacher said something to the
postmistress. There was nobody much
else to Bay anything â for â¢ the wise
eyed yokels, when they met the. youth
and the maid, gave a Bhrewd kindly
nod, and went on their way giving
an Inarticulate but appreciable
chuckle. However, the school teach
er did say something to ,thÂ« post
mistress, whence the ; something
came to Mrs. Hutting's ears. . There
was another ?'row," no doubt
even more "awful." The finish
ing school was, brandished cgaln, but,
after a private consultation' on finance, -
put aside by the' rector and Mrs. Hut
ting. Another weapon was chosen.
Mrs. Hutting dictated a note, the rec
tor wrote and. sealed' it; it was, sent
across to , Old ,Mill\House by theigar-,.
dener, addressed'- to "Jeremy Chlddlng-^
fold Esq." In'- fact, no circumstance I;
of aeremony was omitted, and Dora \
watched the '.messenger of tyranny^
from her t bedroom window. Ih^thef
note (which began "Sir") Jeremy* wasf
plainly given .'to understand that^hej
was no gentleman, and that all rela
tions between the rectory and himself
.were at an end.
Jeremy stumped up and down ' the j
room, furiously exclaiming that he did
not care whether he was a gentleman
or not. He was a man. That was
enough for him and ought to be enough
for anybody. Mrs. Mumple was pos-
Jtively frightened into agreeing with
him on this point. But however sound
the point might be, relations .with the
rectory were broken off! What was to
be done? Jeremy determined to go to
town and lay before Grantley and Si
bylla the unparalleled circumstances
of the case. But first there wasâ well.
' there would beâ one more stolen meet
ing. But it was not quite of the sort
which might have been anticipated.
Dora's levity was gone; she played
with him no more. But neither did she
1 follow the more probable course, and,
5 under the influence of grief and the
"pain of separation give the rein to her
feelings, acknowledge her love and ex
change her vows for his. The old
fashioned standards had their turn;
evidently the rectory upbraidings had
been very severe. Every disobedience,
every trick, every broken promise rose ,
up in judgment and declared the sen
tence to be Just, however severe. Jere
my was at a loss how to face this. He
had been so convinced that nature was
with them and that nature spelt recti
tude. He was aghast at a quasi-theo
logical and entirely superstitious view
that no good or happiness could come
out of a friendship (Dora adhered ob
stinately to this word) initiated in such
a way. He refused to recognize her
wickedness or even his own. When she
announced her full acceptance of the
edict her determination to evince pen
â¢itence by absolute submission, he* could
only burst out:
?'They haven't been cruel to you?"
"Cruel? No! They have been most
most gentle. I've come to see how
wrong It was." .
"Yet you're here!" He could not re?
slst the retort.
"For the. last time â to say good by.
And if you really care at all you must
do as I wish."
"But I may write to you?"
"No, you mustn't."
"You can't stop me thinking about
you."
"I shan't think of vou. I shall pray
to be able not to. I'm sure I can be
strong."
She- had got this idea In her head.
It was just the sort of Idea that Sibylla
might- have got. She wanted to Im
molate herself.' For such views In Si
bylla had always had denun
ciations ready. He had no denuncia
tion now â only a despairing puzzle.
"I can't accept that and I won't! Do
you love me?" ;
"I'm going to Keep my promise to
say nothing. I've told you what I must
do and what you must. I made up
my mind â and â and then I went to the
Sacrament to-day." â¢
Jeremy rubbed his wrinkled brow,
eying this determined penitent very
ruefuily. A sudden return to recti
tude is disconcerting in an accomplice.
He did not know what to do. But his
bulldog persistence was roused and his
square jaw set obstinately.
"Well, . I shall consider what to do.
I believe you love me and I shan't sit
down" under this."
"You must," she said. "And now,
good-by."
He came toward her, but her raised
hand stopped him.
"Good- by like this? You won't even
shake hands?"
"No, I can't. Good-by."
Of course h* was sorry for her, but
he was decidedly angry, too. He per
ceived a case of the selfishness of spir
itual exaltation. His doggedness turn
ed to surliness.
"All right then, good-by," he said
sulkily.
"You're not angry with me?
"Yes I am."
She accepted this additional cross,
and bore It meekly.
"That hurts me very much. But I
must do right. Good-by."
And with that she went, firm to the
last, leaving Jeremy almost as furious
with women as in the palmiest days of
his youth, almost as angry with her as
he had ever been with the long-legged
rectory girL
Pursuing (though he did not know Jt)
paths as well trodden as those which
he had already followed, he formed
an Instant determination In his mind.
She should b* sorry for it! Whether
she should sorrow with a life-long sor
row or whether she should ultimately,
after much grief and humiliation, find
forgiveness, he did not decide for the
moment; both ideas had their attrac
tion. But at any rate, she should be
sorry, and that as soon as possible.
How was it to be brought about?
Jeremy conjectured that a remote and
all-ascertained success in original re
search would not make her sorry, and
his conclusion may be allowed to pass;
nor would a continuance of shabby
clothes and an income of a hundred a
year. This . combination had once
seemed all-sufficient. Nay, It would
suffice now for 'true and whole-hearted
love. But It was not enough to make
a cruel lady repent of her cruelty, nor
to convict a misguided zealot of the
folly of her zeal. It was not dazzling
enough for that In an hour Jeremy
threw his old ideal of life to the winds,
and decided for wealth and mundane
fameâ speedy wealth and speedy mun
dane fame (speed was essential, be
cause Jeremy's . feelings were in a
hurry). Such laurels. and fruits were
not to be plucked in Milldean. That
very night Jeremy packed a well-worn
leather bag and a square deal box. He
w"as going to London, to see Grantley
and Sibylla, to make them acquainted
with the state of the case, and to set
about becoming rich and famous as
speedily, as possible. > His mind o'er
leaped the process and saw it already
completedâ saw 'his return to Milldean
rich and famousâ saw his renewed
meeting with Dora, th* confusion of
the rector and Mrs. Hutting, the un
availingâor possibly at last, availingâ
regret and humiliation of Dora. * It
cannot truthfully be said that he went
to bed altogether unhappy. He had his
dream, even as Dora had hers; he had
his luxury of prospective victory as
she had hers of unreserved and ac
cepted penitence; and they shared the
conviction of a very extraordinary and
unprecedented state of things.
So to town came Jeremy, leaving
Mrs. Mumple alone in Old Mill House.
She was not idle. She was counting
months now â not years now, but
months; and she was knitting socks,
and making flannel shirts, and hem
ming big, red handkerchiefs, and pic
turing .and wondering In her faithful
old heart what that morning would bÂ©
*llke for whose coming she had waited
so many, years. Great hopes and. great
fears were under the ample breast of
;her unshapely merino gown...:)
% In the Imason household the strain
'grew more intense. With rare tenacity)
unimpaired, confidence, and unbroken
pride, Grantley maintained his'.atti
tude. Ife would tire out Sibylla's re-
Volt; he would outstay the fit of sulks,
however, long, it might be. But the
strain told on him, though It did not
break him; he was more away; more
engrossed in his outside activities;
grimmer, and more sardonic when he
was at home; careful to show no feel
ing which might expose him to rebuff;
extending' the scope* of this conduct
from his wife to his child, because his
wife's grievance was bound, up with
the child. And Sibylla, seelngr'the at
titude, seeing partially only and there
fore more resenting the motives, cre
ated out of it and them a monster of
Insensibility, something of an Inhuman
selfishness, seemed the more horrible
and unnatural from the unchanging, if
cold courtesy which Grantley still.dis
played. This Image had been taking
shape ever since their battle at Mill
dean. It had grown with the amused
scorn which was on his face as
he told " her of the specialist's
judgment, and made her see how
foolish Bhe had been, what an unnec
essary fuss she had caused, how dan
gerous and silly , it was to let one's
emotions run (may with one. It had
defined itself yet more clearly through
the months before and after the boy's
birth, as Grantley developed his line
of action and adhered to it, secure
apparently from every assault of nat
ural tenderness. Now the portentous
shape was all complete In her Imag
ination and the monster she had erect
ed freed her from every obligation. By
her hypothesis It was accessible by
no appeal and sensitive to no emotion.
Why, then, labor uselessly? It would
Indeed be to knock your headâ yes, ana
your heart, too â against a flinty wall.
As for trying to show or to cherish love
for It â that seemed to her prostitution
itself. And she had no tenacity ! to
endure such a life as Grantlev, or her
image of Grantley, made for her. In
her headlong fashion she had already
pronounced the alternatives-^leath or
flight. *
And there was the baby boy in his
helplessness; and there was young
Blake with hfs ready hot passion mask
ed by those aspirations of his, and his
fiery indignation seconding and ap
plauding the despair of her own heart.
For Blake knew the truth nowâ the
truth as Sibylla's imaginings made it;
and in view of that truth the thing his
passion urged him to became a holy
duty. His goddess must be no more
misused; her misery must not be al
lowed to endure.
Knowing hjs thought and what his
he'art was toward her Sibylla turned
to him as a child turns simply from
a hard to a loving face. Here was a
life wanting her life, a love asking
hers. She had always believed people
when they said they loved and wanted
herâ why, .she had believed even Grant
ley himselfâ and was always convinced
that their love for her was all they
said it was. It was her Instinct to
believe that. She believed all â aye,
moreâ about young Blake than he be
lieved about himself," though he be
lieved very much Just now; and she
would always have people all white
or all black. Grantley was all black
now, and Blake was very white, white
as snow, while he talked of his as
pirations and his love,. and tempted her
to leave all that bound her and to give
her life to him. He tempted well, for
he offered not pleasure, but the power
of doing I good and bestowing happi
ness. Her first natural love seemed
Why not do that? Do that, and let
honor, at least, stand pure and unim
peached?
The question brought her to the Issue
she had tried to shirk, to thÂ© truth
she had sought to hide. Her love for
the 4 boy was much, but it was not
"That's right. If you want a thing,
you must be ready to wait for it,"
agreed Grantley, with smiling lips and
a pucker on his brow.
"So long as there's any hope," added
Sibylla.
These hints of underlying things
went unheeded by Jeremy, but Blake
marked them. They were becoming
more frequent now as thÂ© tension grew
and grew.
"There's always a hope with reason
able people."
"Opinions differ so much as to what
is reasonable."
"Dora's not reasonable at present,
;anyhow."
Jeremy's mind had not traveled be
yond his own predicament.
The contrast he pointed, the mock-
Ing memories he stirred, made his
presence accentuate and embitter the
strife, confirming Sibylla's despair, un
dermining even Grantley's . obstlnata
self-confidence; . while to Blake his ex
ample, however much one might smile
at it seemed to cry, "Courage!" He
who would have the prize must not
shrink from the struggle.
That night Sibylla sat long by her
boy's cot. Little Frank slept quietly
(he had been named after his god
father, Grantley's friend, that Lord
Caylesham who was also the Fan
shaws" friend), while his mother fought
against the love and the obligation that
bound her to himâ a sad flghf Jo wage.
She had some arguments not lack'ng
epeciousness. To what life would he
grow up in .such a home as theirs!
Look at the life the Courtland chil
dren led! Would not anything be bet
ter than that â any scandal in the past,
any loss in present and future? She
called to her help, too, that occasional
pang which the helpless little being
gave her, he the innbeent cause and
ignorant embodiment of all her perish
ed hopes. Might not that come oftener?
Might it not grow and grow till It
conquered all her love, and she ended
by hating because she might have
loved so greatly? Horrible! Yes, but
had It not nearly come to pass with
one whom she had loved very greatly?
It could not be called Impossible, how
ever to be loathed the idea of it might
be. No, not impossible! Her husband
was the child's father. Did he love
him? No, she criedâ she had almost
persuaded herself that his Indifference
screened a positive dislike. And if It
were not impossible, any desperate
thing would be better than the chance
of It. But for Grantley she could love,
she could go on lovingâ the child. Then
why not make an end of her life with
Grantleyâ the life that was souring her
heart and turning all love to bitter
ness? Grantley would not want the
child, and, not wanting it, would let
her have it. She did not believe that
he would burden himself with the boy
for the sake of depriving; her of him.
She admitted with a passing smile that
he had not this small spltefulness â his
vices were on a larger scale. She could
go to Grantley and say she must leave
him. No law and no power could pre
vent her. and she believed that sh*
could take the boy with her.
to have spent Itself on" Grantley; she
had no passion left, save the passion
of giving. It was to this he made his
appeal; this would be- enough to give
him all his way. Tet there was the
child. That was where the struggle
would be; it was there that he dis
trusted the Justice of his own demand
on. her, there that his passion had to
drown the Inward voices of protest.
It might have happened that Jeremy,
with his fresh lovÂ© and fresh ambi
tions, would ibavÂ© been a relief to such
a position; that his appeal both to
sympathy and to amusement would
have done something to clear the at
mosphere. So far as he himself went,
indeed, he was irresistible; his frank
ness and his confidence wer* not to be
denied. .Trusting In the order of na
ture he knew no bashfulness; trusting
in himself, he had no misgivings. With
out a doubt he was right! They all
agreed that the old Ideal of original
research on a hundred a year must b*
abandoned and that Jeremy must be- 1
comÂ© rich and famous as soon as pos
sible.
"Though whether you ought to for
give her in the end is, I must say, a
very difficult point," remarked Grant
ley, with a would-be thoughtful smile.
"In cases of penitence I myself favor
forgiveness, Jeremy."
"But there Is the revelation of her
character," suggested Sibylla, taking
the matter more seriously, or treating
its want of seriousness with mor*. ten
derness.
"I'm inclined to think th* young
lady's right at present," said. Blake.
"What you have to do is to give her
ground for changing "her views â and
to give her mother eround for chang
ing hers, too."
Jeremy listened to them all with en
grossed interest. Whatever their at
titude, they all confirmed his view.
"You once spoke of a berth in the
city?" he said to Grantley.
"Not much fame there; but perhaps
you may as well take things by in
stallments."
""I don't like it, you know. It's not
my Hn* at all."
Blake came to the rescue. The Sel
fords drew their money from large and
important dyeing works, although Sel
ford himself had retired from any act
ive share in the work of the business.
There was room for scientific aptitude
In dyeing works, Blake opined rather
vaguely. "You could make chemistry,
for instance, subserve the needs of
commerce, couldn't you?"
"That really. is a good suggestion,"
said Jeremy approvingly.
"Capital!" Grantley agreed. "We'll
get at Selford for you, Jeremy; and,
if, necessary, we'll club together, and
send to Terra del Fuego, and buy Janet
Selford a new dog."
"I begin to see my way," Jeremy an
nounced.
Whereat the men laughed, while Si
bylla came round and kissed him,
laughing, too. What a very short time
ago, and she had been even as Jeremy,
as sanguine,, as confident, seeing her
way' as clearly, with Just as little war
rant of knowledge!
"Meanwhile you mustn't mope, old
chap," said Grantley.
"Mope? I've no time for, moping.
Do you think I could see this Selford
to-morrow?"
"I'll give you a letter to take to him,"
laughed^ Grantley. "But don't ask for
ten thousand a year all at once, you
know."
"I know , the world. When. I really
want a thing, I can wait for it."
But it was evident that he did not
mean to wait very long. Grantley said
ten thousand a year: a thousand would
seem riches to the Milldean rectory
folk. â¢
enough, it did not satisfy. "Was It
even the greatest thing? As It were

The answer could not be denied, how
ever she might stand condemned by it.
Of physical passion she acquitted her

greater passion for intercourse of soul,

The Olive Branch.
Suzette Bllgh was staying at the
Courtlands'â that Suzejtt* who had
been at Mrs. Raymore's party, and
was, according; to Christine Fanshaw,
a baby compared with Anna Selford.
although ten years her. senior. She
had neither father nor mother, and
depended on her brother for a home.
He had gone abroad for a time, and
Lady Harriet had taken her in, partly
from kindness (for Lady Harriet had
kind Impulses), partly to have some
body to grumble to when she was feel
ing too conscientious to grumble to the
children. This did happen sometimes.
None the less the children heard a
good deal of grumbling, and in Su
eette's opinion knew far too much
about the state of the household. They
were all girls. Lucy, Sophy and Vera,
and ranged in age from thirteen to
nine. They took to Suzette, and taught
her several things about the house be
fore she had been long in it; and she
relieved Lady Harriet of them to a
certain extent, thereby earning grati
tude no less than by her readiness- to
listen to grumblings. Tom was little
seen Just now; he came home very late
and went out very early; he never met
his wife; he used Just to look in on the
children at schoolroom breakfast,
which Suzette had elected to share
with them, Lady Harriet taking the
meal In her own room. It was not a
pleasant house to say In, but It was
tolerably comfortable, and Suzette, net
asking. too much of life, was content
enough to be there, could tell herself
that she was of use, and was happy In
performing an act of friendship.
Of course the question was how long
Lady Harriet would stand it. The lit
tle girls knew that this was the ques
tion; they were Just waiting for
mamma to break out. They had not
disliked their mother in the past; oc
casional fits of temper are not what
children hate most. They endure
them, hoping for better times, or con
trive to be out of the way when, the
tempest arises. Cracks with any im
plement that came handy were the
order of the day when the tempest had
risen; but on calm days Lady Harriet
had been carelessly indulgent, and, la
her way, affectionate to the girls. But
now the calm days grew rare, the tem
pests more frequent and violent. Fear
grew, love waned, hatred was on its
way to their hearts. They had never
disliked their father; though they had
no great respect for him, they loved
him. They regarded him with com
passionate sympathy, as the person on
whom most of the cracks fell; and they
quitÂ© understood why he wanted to
keep out of the way. They had list
ened to their mother's grumbling; they
had listened to the talk of the serv
ants, too. Suzette was no check on
their speculations; they liked her very
much, but they were not in the least
In aw* of her.
"Will you take us for & walk th!Â»
afternoon. Miss Bllgh?" asked Sophy,
at schoolroom breakfast on Sunday.
"Because Garrett says mamma's not
well to-day, and we'd better not go
near herâ she's going to stay in her
own room till tea time."
"Of course I will, dears," said Suzetta
Bllgh.
"Oh, there's nothing; th* matter with
mamma, really." declared Lucy â "only
she's in an awful fury. I met Oarrett
coming out of her room, and she looked
frightened to death."
"Ah. but you don't know why!" piped
up Vera's youthful voice In accents of
triumph. - "I dot I was in the hall. Just
behind the curtain of the archway, and
I heard Peters tell th* new footman.
Papa was expected last night and
mamma had left orders that she should
be told when he came In. But hs did,
notâ"
"WÂ« all know that, Vtra," Sophy in
terrupted, contemptuously. "He sent
word that he'd been called out of town
and wouldn't be back till Monday."
"And the message didn't set here till
12 o'clock. Fancy, Miss Bllgh I"
"Well, I'm glad you're going to taks

a manner far from comforting.
Lady Harriet -was by way of teach

endeared the language to them.

mused Sophy. :
"Now, Sophy, that's no business of

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL 1 .
There was one point - about Jeremy
Chiddingfold's system of philosophyâ
if that name may be allowed to dignify,
the rather mixed assortment of facts
and inferences which he had gathered
from his studies: this point was that
there was no appeal against facts. Na
ture was nature, feelings were feel
ings and change was development.
One thing was right to-day; it became
wrong to-morrow without ceasing to
have been right yesterday. Let there
be an end of ignorant parrot-like chat
ter about Inconsistency! Is evolution
inconsistency? Inconsistency with
what? He put this question and kin
dred ones quite heatedly to Mrs. Mum
pie, who did not at all understand
them, and to whom thev savored of
unorthodoxy; she had ever distrusted a
scientific education. If Jeremy could
have put his case in a concrete form
he would have won her sympathy. But
she did not know where such general
principles would stop and she had
heard that there were persons who im
pugned the authority of Moses.
Jeremy did not care much about Mrs.
Mumple's approval, though he tried
his arguments on her as a boxer tries
his lists on a stuffed sack (she sug
gested the simile). He did not ex
pect to convince her and would have
been rather sorry if he had. In her
present mental condition she was in
valuable as a warning and a butt. But
it was exasperating that Mrs. Hutting:
should hold antique, ludicrous and* (in
his opinion) in the end debased views
about social intercourse between the
sexes â in fact (to descend to that con
crete which Jeremy's soul abhorred)
about girls of 17 taking walks with
young men of 22. Mrs. Hutting's views
on this point imposed on Jeremy pro
ceedings which he felt to be unbe
coming to a philosopher. He had to
Echeme, to He in wait, to plan most
unlikely accidents, on occasion to pal
ter with truth, to slip behind a wagon
or to hide inside a barn. A recogni
tion on Mrs. Hutting's part of nature,
of facts and of development would have
relieved Jeremy from all these distaste
ful expedients.
But Mrs. Hutting: was an old fash
ioned woman. She obeyed her husband
â usually, however, suggesting' on what
points he might reasonably require
obedience. She expected her daughter
to obey her. And she had her views,
which she had enforced in a very quiet
but a very firm way. Modern tenden
cies were not in favor at the rectory;
that being established as a premise,
it followed that anything which was
disapproved of at the rectory was a.
modern tendency; wherefore clandes
tine and spuriously accidental meet
ings between young men and young
women were a modern tendency, or,
anyhow, signs of oneâ and of a very
bad one, too. No ancient instances
would have shaken Mrs. Hutting on
this point; the chain of lojjlc was too
strong. Certainly Dora never tried to
shake her mother's Judgment orto
break the chain. For DoiVi was old
fashioned, too. She admitted that
clandestine and spuriously accidental
meetings were wrong. But sometimes
the clandestine character or the spu
rlousness of the accident could be
plausibly questioned; besides, a thing
may be wronj? and yet not be so very,
very bad. And the thing may be such
fun, and so amusing thatâ well,
one goes, and tries not to be
found out On these ancient
but not obsolete lines Miss Dora
The Flinty Wall.and laughed. "That's not moral ad
vice or I wouldn't set up to give it.
But lt'3 a prudential consideration."
"And if you are sure?"
"Sure for both, I mean, you know."
"Yes, sure for both."
"Well, then you're In such a bad
way that you'd better pack up and go
to the Himalayas or somewhere like
that without an hour's delay, because
nothing else'll save you, you know."
Blake laughed rather contemptu
ously.
"After all. there have been cases â "
"Perhapsâ rbut I don't like such
long odds."
"Well, we've had your gospel. Now
let's hear how It's worked in your
own case. Are you satisfied with
that, Caylesham?"
He spoke with a eneer that did not
escape Caylesham's notice. \ It drew
another smile from him.
"That's a home question â I didn't
question you as straight as that. Well,
I'll tell you. I won't pretend to feel
what I don't feel; I'll tell you as
truly as I can." He paused a mo
ment. "I've had lota of fun," he went
on. "I've always had plenty of
money; I've never had any work to
do, and I took my fun-Mots of It. I
didn't expect to get it for nothing,
and I haven't got It for nothing.
Sometimes I got It cheap, and some
times, one way and another, it mount
ed to a very stiff figure. But I didn't
shirk settling day; and if there are
any more settling days I won't shirk
them if I can help it. I don't think
I've got anything to complain about."
He put his cigar back Into his mouth.
"Xc, I don't think I have," he ended,
twisting the 'cigar between his teeth.
What a contempt for him young
Blake had! Was ever man so igno
rant of his true self? Was ever man
sunk in degradation and so utterly
unconscious of it? Caylesham could
look back on a life spent as his had
been â could look back from the
middle-age to which he had now
come, and find nothing much amiss
with it! Blake surveyed his groveling:
form from high pedestals of courage
and of wisdom â absolutely of virtue
pure and undeflled.
"Nothing vejry Ideal about that!"
"Good Lord, no! You wanted the
truth, didn't you?"
"Well, I suppose I thought like
that once â I was contented with that
once."
"You certainly used to give the Im
pression of bearing up under It,"
smiled Caylesham. 'But things are
changed now, are they?"
"Yes, thank God! Imagine going
on like that all your life!"
Caylesham threw himself into a
chair with a hearty laugh. "
"Now we have gone as far as we
can- with discretion," he declared.
He was never more convinced of his
wisdom and courage than when he lis
tened to Caylesham's conversation
They were race course arid club ac
quaintances, and had lunched together
at Caylesham's flat on the Sunday on
which John Fanshaw went to Lady
Harriet's house in order to show her
the errdr of her ways. Blake glowed
with- virtue as he listened to his
friend's earthy views and measured his
frjend's degraded standards against his
own.
"The one duty," said Caylesham,
ham, somewhat circumscribing the do
main of morality, as his habit was,
"is to avoid a row. Don't " get the
woman into a scrape." From gossip
iris about Tom Courtland they had
drifted into discussing the converse
case. "That really sums it all up, you
know." If was a chilly day, and he.
warmed himself luxuriously before the
fire. "I don't set myself up as a pat
tern to the youth, but I've never done
that anyhow."
Virtuous Blake would have liked to
rehearse to him all the evil things he
had done â the meanness, the hypoc
risy, the degradation he had caused
and shared, but it is not possible to
speak quite so plainly to one's friends.
"Yes, that's the gospel," he said sar
castically. "Avoid a row. Nothing
else matters, does it?" .
"Nothing else matters in the end," I
mean," smiled Caylesham, good
naturedly conscious of the sarcasm and
rather amused at it. "As long as
there's no row things settle down
again, you see. But if there's a row,
see where you're left! Look- what
you've got on your/ hands, by Jove!
And the women don't want a row
â¢ either, really, you know. They may
talk as if they did â in fact, they're
rather- fond of talking as If they did;
and they may think they do sometimes.
But when it comes to the point they
don't. And, what's more, they don't
easily forgive a man who gets them
Into a â¢ row. It means too much to
them, too much by a deal, Blake."
"And what does it mean when
there's no row?"
"Oh, well, of course, in a certain
sense you have me," Caylsham admit
ted with a candid smile. "If you like
to take the moral line you have me, of
course. I was speaking of the world
as we know it, and- 1 don't suppose
it's ever been particularly different.
Not in my time anyhow, I can an
swer for that."
"You're wrong, Caylesham, wrong
all through. If the thing has come
turned away and sat down in her chair
again.
"Good-by," he muttered, and douched
awkwardly out of the room.
' She sat on where she was, very still,
frowning, her hand holding her chin,
only her restless eyes roving about the

Images and Their Work.
By this time young Walter Blake
had hot only clearly determined what
he wanted and meant to do; he had
also convinced himself of his wisdom
and courage In wanting and. meaning
to do it. He was not blind, he de
clared, to the disagreeable and dis
tressing incidents. There were painful
features. There would be a scandal,
and- there would be an awkward and
uncomfortable periodâ a provisional pe
riod before life settled down on its
new and true lines. That was inev
itable, since this caseâ the case of him
self and Sibyllaâ was exceptional,
whereas laws and customs were made
for the ordinary cases. He did not
condemn the laws and customs whole
sale, but he was capable of seeing when
a case was exceptional, and he had
the wisdom and the courage to act on
what he perceived. He even admitted
that very- few. cases were really excep
tional, and took the more credit for
perceiving that this one really was. He
did not take Grantley into, account at
all, neither what he was nor what he
might do. Grantley seemed to him
negligible. He cpnflned his considera
tion to Sibylla and himselfâ and the
exceptional nature of the case was ob
vious. He was a prey to his ready
emotions and to his ' facile exaltation.
Desires masqueraded as reasons, and
untempered impulses, wore the decent
cloak of a high resolve. ' If he could
have put the case like that to himself,
it might not have seemed so 'plainly
exceptional.
to such a point the only honest thing
is to see it through, to face it, to undo
the mistake, to put things where they
ought to have been from the begin
ning." . .
"Capital! And how are you going,
to do it?" /
"There's only one way of doing it."
Caylesham's smile broadened; he
pulled his long mustache delicately as
he snid:
"Bolt?" ,
Blake nodded sharply.
. "Oh, my dear boy!"
He laughed in a gentle, comfortable
way and drew his coat right up into
the small of hi3 back.
"Oh, my dear boy!" he murmured
again.
Nothing could have made Walter
Blake feel more virtuous and more
courageous.
"The only honest and honorable
thing," he Insisted â "the only self-re
specting thing for both."
"You convert the world to that and
I'll think about it."
"What do I care about the world?
It's enough for me to know what I
think and feel about it. And I've no
shadow of doubt."
His face flushed a little and he
spoke rather heatedly.
"I wouldn't interfere with your con
victions for the world and, as I'm a
bachelor, I don't mind them." He was
looking at Blake rather keenly now,
wondering what made the young man
take the subject so much to heart.
"But if I were you I'd keep them in
the theoretical stage, I think." - .
He laughed again and turned to
light a cigar. Blake was smoking,
too. one cigarette after another,
quickly and nervously. Caylesham.
looked down on him with a good hu
mored smile. He liked young Blake
in a half contemptuous fashion and
would have .been sorry to see him
mnke a fool of himself out and out.
"I'm not going to ask you any ques
tions," he said, "though I may have
an Idea about you In my head. ,But
I'm pretty' near twenty years older
than you, I fancy,, and I've knocked
about a good bit and I'll tell you one
or two plain truths. When you talk
like that you assume that these things
last. Well, in nine cases out of ten
they don't. I don't say that's nice or
a,mlable or elevated or anything else.
I didn't make human nature and I
don't particularly admire it} But .there
jt i S â in nine > cases out of ten, you
know. And if you think you know a
case that's the tenth "
This was exactly ' what Blake was
sure he did know.
"Yes, what then?" he asked de
fiantly. .
."Well," 'answered Caylesham slow
ly, "you be jully sure first before you
act on that impression.- You be Jolly
well sure first â that's all." He pausert
"What do you mean by that?" asked
Blake rather angrily.
"Well, I'm not an Idiot, am I, as
well as a moral deformity?"
"I don't know what you're talking
about."
"Yes, but I know what you've been
talking about. Blake. I know It all
except one thing â and that I don't
propose to ask." ,.
Blake rose with a sulky air and
tossed away the end of his cigarette.
"And what's that?"
"The lady's name, my boy," said
Caylesham. placidly.
This talk Â¦ was fuel to Blake's
flame. It showed him the alterna
tive â the only alternative. (He for
got that suggestion about the Hima
layas, which did not. perhaps, de
serve to be forgotten.) And the al
ternative was hideous to him now â
hideous In its loss of all nobility, of
all the ideal, in Its cynically open
eyed acceptance of what was low and
base. He would have come to that
but for Sibylla. But for him, even
Sibylla â Sibylla mated to Grantley â Â¦
might have come to it also. It was
from such a fate as this that they
must rescue one another. One 'wise
decision, one courageous stroke, and
the thing was done. Very emo
tional, very exalted, he contrasted
with the life Caylesham had led the
life he and Sibylla were to lead. Could
any man hesitate? With a new im
petus and with louder self-applause he
turned to his task of persuading Si
bylla to the decisive step.
Part of the work was accomplished.
Sibylla had cast Grantley out of her
heart; she disclaimed and denied both
her love and her obligation to him.
The harder part remained: that had
been half done in her vjgil bv the
baby's cot. But it was ever in danger
of being undone again. A cry from the
boy's lips, the trustful clinging of his
arms from day to day, fought against
Blake. Only in those gusts of un
natural feeling, those spasms of re
pugnance born of her misery, was she
in heart away from the child. On
these Blake could not rely, nor did he
seek to, since to speak of them brought
her to instant remorse; but left to be
brooded over In silence they might help
him yet. He trusted his old weapons
more â his need of her love and her
need to give It. Caylesham's life gave,
him a new instance and added strength
to his argument He told her of the
man. though not the man's name,
sketching the life and the state of mind
it brought a man to.
"That was my life till you came." he
said. . "That was what was waiting for
me. Am I to go back to that?"
He could attack her on another side,
too.
began Lucy, with an air of experience.
"We must really start, Lucy, dear,"
urged Suzette.
"What have you come to see mamma
about?" asked Vera. shrilly.
"To find out how to keep little girls
Lady Harriet â a give-and-take, you
know."
"Well?" She was relapsing into that
dangerous stillness of hers. She was
very quiet, but her eyes shone very
bright. Tom Courtland would have
in or*der," answered John, facetiously
rebuking curiosity.
"I expect you've come about papa,"
observed Vera, with disconcerting
calmness and an obvious contempt for
this Joke.
"I'm going to start, anyhow," de
clared ' poor Suzette. "Come along,
dears, do!"
"Well, if there's a great row, Gar
rett'll hear some of it and tell us," said
Sophy, consoling herself and her sis
ters as they reluctantly walked away
from the center of interest.
John Fanshaw's happiness was with
him stillâ the happiness which Cayle
sham's check had brought. It was not
banked yet, but it would be to-morrow;
and. in the last two days John had
taken steps to reassure everybody, to
tell everybody that they would be
paid without question or difficulty,, to
scatter the cloud of gossip and suspi
cion which had gathered round his
credit in the city. It was now quite
understood that John's firm had weath
ered any trouble which had threat
ened it, and could be trusted and fully
relied on again. Hence John's happy
mind, and, a result of the happy mind,
a sanguine and eager wish to effect
some good, to bring about some sort of
reconciliation and a modus Vivendi, In
the Courtland family. His hopes were
not visionary or unreasonable; he did
not expect to establish romantic bliss
there; a modus Vivendi commended
itself to him as the best way of ex
pressing what he was going to suggest
to Lady Harriet. In this flush of happy
and benevolent feeling he was really
glad that he had consented to under
take the embassy.
Lady Harriet liked John Fanshaw.
She called him John and, though he did
not quite venture to reciprocate the
familiarity, he felt that It gave him a
position In dealing with her. Also he
thought her a very handsome woman;
and, since she was aware of this, there
was another desirable element in their
acquaintance. And he thought that he
knew how to manage womenâ he was
f-ure he would not have made such a
bad Job of it as poor Tom had. So he
went in without any fear, and found
justification in the cordiality of his
welcome. Indeed the welcome was too
cordial, inasmuch as it was based on
an erroneous notion.
"You're the very man of all men I
wanted-to see! I was thinking of send
ing for you. Come and sit down, John,
and I'll tell you all about it."
"But I know all about it," he pro
tested, "and I "want to have a talk to
you."
"Nobody can know but me; and I be
lieve you're the beet friend I have. I
want to tell you everything, and take
your advice how I'm to act."
E\*idently she did not suppose that he
was in any sense an embassador from
her husband. He was to be her friend.
Miun u liic tig nt- , eu nuuiu me gins.
"We've got him to sfty what I've told
you; but there must be something from
your side."
"What am I to do, John?" she asked
with deceptive meekness.
"Well, I think you might â wellâ er â
express some regret thatâ that things
haven't been more harmonious at
home. You might hold out an . olive
branch, you know."
"Kxpress regret?"
"Don't stand on a point of pride now.
Haven't yon sometimes been â well, a
little exacting â a little quick-tern?
pered?"
"Oh, you're in that old story, are
you? Quick-tempered! Suppose I am!
Haven't I enough to make me quick
tempered?"
"Yes, now you have. But what about
the beginning?"
"Do you mean it was my fault In the
beginning?"
"Don't you think so yourself? Partly,
at all events?"
Lady Harriet took up a tortoise shell
paper knife and played with it. Her
eyes were set hard on John, who did
not like the expression in them. He
became less glad that he had under
taken the embassy.
"May a man desert and deceive his
wife because she's a little quick-tem
pered?"
"No, no, of course not; that's ab
surd."
"It's -what you're saying, isn't it?"
"We must look at it , as men and
women of the world."
"I look at it as a wife and a mother.
Do you mean to say It was my fault
in the beginning?"
John was losing patience; he saw
that some plain speaking would be nec
essary, but his want of patience made
it hard for him to do the plain speak
ing wisely.
"Well, yes, I do," he said. "In the
beginning, you know. Tom's a good
natured fellow, and he was very fond
of you. But youâ well, you didn't
make his home pleasant to him; and
if a man's home isn't pleasant, you
know what's likely to happen."
"And you're the friend I meant to
send for!"
"I am your friend â that's why I ven
ture to speak to you freely. There's no
hope unless you both realize where
you've been wrong. Tom acknowl
edges his fault and is ready to change
his ways. But you must acknowledge
yours and change, too."
"What is my fault?"
John took a turn up and down the
room.
"I must let her have it," he decided,
as he came back to the hearthrug.
"You make everybody afraid of you
with your lamentable fits of temper,"
he told her. "Tom's afraid of you, and
afraid of what you might drive him
Into. The children are afraid cf you.
are! You to come and lecture me as if
I was a child! I may be anything you
like, but I've never been what your
wife was, John Fanshaw."
He turned on her quickly.
"What do you mean by that?"
"That's my affair."
"No, it isn't. You've dared to hint â "
"Oh, I hint nothing I don't know." )
"You shall give me an explanation of
those words. I insist upon that."
"You'd better not," she laughed ma
liciously.
John was moved beyond self-eontrol.
He caught her by the wrist. She rose
and stood facing him, her breath com
ing quick. She was in a fury that
robbed her of all Judgment and all
mercy; but she had no fear of him.
"You shall withdraw those words or
explain them!"
"Ask Christine to explain them," she
sneered. "What a fool you are! Here's
a man to give lectures on the man
agement of wives, when his own
wifeâ" She broke off laughing again.
"You shall tell me what you mean."
"Dear me, you can't guess? You've
turned very dull, John. Never mind!
Don't make too much of It! Perhaps
you were quick-tempered? Perhaps you
didn't make her home pleasant? And if
a woman's home isn't pleasant â well,
you know what's likely to happen,
don't you?"
Perspiration was on John Fanshaw's
brow. He pressed her wrist hard.
"You she-devil!" he said. "Tell me
what you mean, I say!"
"Oh, ask Christine! And if she won't
tell you. I advise you to apply to Frank
Caylesham, John."
"Is that true?"
"Yes, it is. Don't break my wrist."
"Caylesham!"
He held her wrist a moment longer,
then dropped It, and looked aimlessly
round the room.
She rubbed her wrist and glared at
him with sullen eyes, her fury dying
down into a malicious rancor.
"There, that's what you get from
your meddling, and your preaching!"
she said. "I never meant to give
Christine away, I never wanted to. It's
your doing; you made me angry, and I
hit out at you where I could. I wish
to God you had never come here, John!
Christine's one<of the few women who
are friendly to me, and now I've â But
you've yourself to thank for it."
He sank slowly into i a chair; she
heard him mutter "Caylesham!" again.
"If you know I've a quick temper,
why do you exasperate me? You ex
asperate me, and then J do a thing like
that! Oh, I'm not thinking of you; I'm
thipking of poor Christine. I hate my-
John found it difficult to correct this
mistake of hers.
"I'm at the end of my patience," she
said solemnly. "I'm sure anybody
would be. You know what's happen
ing as well as I do, and I intend to put
an end to it."
"Oh. don't say thst! I â Â¦well, I'm
here just to prevent you from saying
that."
"To prevent me? You do know what's
happening. Do you know he's stay
ing awav from home again? What do
the servants think? What must the
children begin to think? Am I to be
exposed to that?"
She looked very handsome and spirit
ed, with just the right amount of color
in her cheeks and an animated sparkle
in her eyes.
"Why, I could name the woman!"
she exclaimed. "And so could you, I
daresay?"
"Don't make too much of it," he
urged. "We're not children. He does
not really care about the woman. It's
only' because he's unhappy."
"And whose fault is it he's unhap
py?"
"And because of : that he's being
foolishâ wasting all his money, too,
I'm afraid."
"Oh, I've got my settlement. I shall
be all right in case of proceednigs."
"Now, pray, don't think of proceed
ings. Lady Harriet."
"Not think of them! I've made up
my mind to them. I wanted to ask
you how to set about it."
"But it would ruin his career; it
would destroy his public position."
"I can't help that. He should have
thought of that for himself."
"And then think of the girls!"
"Anything would be better than go
ing on like thisâ yes, better for them,
too:"
John saw that he must face an ex
planation of his embassy. He got up
and stood on the hearthrug.
"I'm here as the friend of you both,"
he began.
The color and the sparkle both grew
brighter.
"Oh, are you?" said Lady Harriet.
"It comes to this. Tom's friendsâ I
and one or two more â have been speak
ing seriously to him. We've got him,
to say he's ready to dropâ to drop what
you very properly object toâ and to
make another effort to find a â a modus
Vivendi.
"I'm glad he's got so much decent
feeling! Only it comes rather late. He
wants me to forgive him, does he?"
"I don't think we can put it quite
so simply as that." John risked a timid
smile. "There must be a give-and-take.
Vera, .suppose you go and ask mamma
to let us have some of that strawberry
jam at tea."
"Yes. let's make her bo," Sophy
chimed in gleefully.
"You may do anything you like," de
clared Vera, "but you can't make me
go â not if you kill me, you can't!"
The two elder girls giggled merrily
at her panic.
Poor Suzette was rather in despair
about these childrenâ not because they
were unhappy. Their mother's hu
mors, if alarming, were also the cause
of much excitement. Their father's
plight, if sorrowful, was by no means
wanting in the comic aspect. The sus
pense in which they waited to see how
long Lady Harriet would stand it had
a distinct spice of pleasure in it. But
the pity of it all! Suzette's training,
not less than her fidelity to Lady Har
riet, inclined her to lay far the heavier
blame on Tom Courtland. But she did
have a notion that Ladv Harriet must
be very trying â and the more she list
ened to the children the more that idea
grew. And between them, the mother
and the father were responsible for
such a childhood as this. The children
were not bad girls, she thought, but
they were in danger of being coarsened
and* demoralized: they were learning
to laugh when they had better have
cried. It was 'Suzette's way to be
rather easilv shocked, and she was
very much shocked at this.
They were Just starting for their aft
ernoon walk when John Fenshaw ar
rived and found them all in the hall.
He was an old friend â Vera's godfath*
erâand was warmly welcomed. John
was very cheery to-day; he joked with
the children and paid Suzette Bligh a
compliment. Then Vera wanted to
know why h<? had called:
"Because papa's not at home, you
know."
"Never mind that, puss. I've come
to Fee vour mamma."
"You've come to see mamma!" ex
claimed Lucy.
Glances were exchanged between the
three â humorous excited glances; ad
miring amused eyes turned to John
Fanshaw. Here was the man who
was going to enter the lion's den!
"Shall we start, dears?" suggested
Suzette Bligh apprehensively.
No notice was taken. Sophy gave
John a direct and friendly warning.
"You'd better look out, you know,"
she said; "mamma's just furious be
cause papa's not come back."
"But It's not my fault, missie," said
John. "She can't put me in the corner
fcr it."
"Well, If you happen to be there "
self now, and that's your doing too!"
She flung herself into her chair and
began to sob tempestuously. John
stared past her to the wall.
"It's just what Tom's" always done;"
she moaned through her sobsâ "making
me lose my. temper, and say something,
and then â " Her words became inar
ticulate. Â¦Â¦Â¦-"'?-
Presently her sobs ceased; her face
grew hard and set again; . -
"Well, are you going to sit there all
day?" she asked. "Is it so pleasant
that you want to stay? Do you still
think you can teach me the error of
my ways?" N
From the first moment John Fan
shaw had not doubted the truth of
what she said. Things forced out by
passion in that way were true. Her
stormy remorse was added proof â a
remorse which did not even attempt
retraction or evasion. And his mem
ory got to work. He knew now why
Christine had been so reluctant to go
to Caylesham. There were things back
in the past, too, which now became in
telligible â how that acquaintance had
grown and grown, how constant the
companionship had been, "one or two
little things which, had seemed odd,
and then how there had been a sudden
end, and they had come to see very
little of Caylesham, how neither of
them had seen him for a long while,
tili John had sent Christine to borrow
Â£15,000.
"For God's sake, go!" she cried.
He rose to his feet slowly and her
fascinated eyes watched his face. His
eyes were dull, and his face seemed
to have gone gray. He asked her one
question:
"How long ago?"
"Oh, all over years ago," she an
swered, with an impatient groan,
drumming her fingers on the arms of
her chair.
He nodded his head in a thoughtful
way.
j "Good-by, Lady Harriet," he said.
1 "Good-by, John." Suddenly she
sprang up. "Stop! What are you go
ing to say to Christine?"
He looked bewildered still.
'.'I don't, know. Oh, really I don't
know! My God, I never had any idea of
this, and I don't know! I can't â can't
realize it all, you know â And Cayles
ham too!"
"Are you going to tell her I told
you?"
"I don't know what I'm going to do,
Lody Harriet â I don't know."
"Ah!"
With â¢ a cry of exasperation she
"You fool!" she said. "You silly fool!
You come to me with this nonsense!
You tell me you'd have shown more
firmness! You tell "me it's my fault
Tom's gone off after this creature}
Much you know about it all! Wonder*
fully wise you are! Leave other men's
wives alone, and go back and look
after your own, John."
"There's nothing that I'm aware of
wrong in my house. Lady Harriet. We
needn't bring that into the question."
"Oh, we needn't, needn't we? And
there never was anything wrong, I sup
pose? I'm such a bad wife, am I? Oth
er men have bad wives too."
"Do you attach any particular mean
ing to that?" he asked coldly, but rath
er uneasily.
"Do I attach â ? Oh, what an idiot you
"Look at that!" he said, pointing to
the broken paper-knife. "Just try to
think what thatâ that sort of thing
means'. What man can be expected to
stand that? The state of things which
ha* arisen is your fault. You've made
n*o effort to govern your temper. You're
reaping the fruit of what you've sown.
If poor Tom had shown more firmness
it might have been better."
Xi'ou'd have shown more firmness, I
suppose?"
"Yes, , I and I believe it
would have done some^good: You may
suppose it gives me great pain to speak
like this, but really it's the only way.
Unless you realize how greatly you've
been to blame, unless you determine to
conquer this deplorable feeling, there's
no hope of doing any good."
She sat quiet for a moment or two
longer with shining eyes, while John,
now confident and very masculine,
developed the subject of the real truth
about her. Then she broke out:
Everybody's afraid of you. You make
the house impossible to live in. You're
even violent sometimes, I'm afraid.
Lady Harriet."
If breaking a paper-knife in^ two be
violence, she was violent then. She
threw the pieces down on the table
angrily.
"How dare you, come to me and talk
like this? I've done nothing; I've noth
ing to blame myself for. What I've
had to put up with would have spoiled
anybody's temper! Express regret? I
stiall do nothing of the kind. If that's
what you cbome to ask, you can take
your answer and go."
She was working herself up to the
full tide of her rage. John's undertak
ing was quite hopeless now, but he
would not recognize it yet; he deter
mined to "let her have it" a little more
still.

2 writers to the front, the Sunday Call announces a weekly fiction con-
4 , test in which a cash prize of $50 will be paid each week for the best

9 terial for fiction or more prolific in pens gifted to give spirit to the
Â© material at hand than is California and the West Therefore the Sun-
J| day Call offers $so for the best story submitted each week by a West-
j ' em writer. Stories of Western life and Western characters will, as a
2 rule, be given the preference, but all strong stories, and especially
5 strong stories by new writers, will receive careful consideration.
9 Each story will be judged strictly upon its literary merit Type-
â¢ written copy is the easiest to read and will receive the first cbnsider-
â¢ ation from the editor, but do riot hesitate to send a story in hand-
** writing if you cannot afford to have it typewritten.
q Fifty dollars in cash for a story of not less than 2500 words and

Sc33Â©QaÂ©*c*ceoQOoÂ©Â©ooÂ©eoÂ©oeÂ©oÂ©coeÂ©Â©eÂ©eoeeo*eeo 0; Jose Berega, -. the , Portuguese track
walker, was returning from his beat in
the snowsheds to * his little hutch
which clung to the eaves of the sheds
like a hornet's nest. He had just fin-
raw nands he paddled at the snow,
dog-like; he strained and cursed. A
heave of his great shoulder drew a re
sponsive creak from the door. He
withdrew a few feet and hurled his
great body in a desperate plunge
against the pine slabs. A sharp re
port, and the barrier flew inward;
amidst a cloud of snow, the huge bulk
hurtled headlong through the opening
and. sprawled on the floor within.
He lay as he fell and his great body
shook and twitched with sobs of weak
ness. Fxom the wilderness of wind
raked peaks high up In the mists,
down through the tortuous alleyways
of scarp and crag, there answered the
querulous wall of the wind, long drawn,
shuddering.
Then came the snowâ from out the
great murk of cloud stretching over this
bleak ridge of \ the world there sifted
swiftly, silently,- the white smother.
About the vagabond in the cabin there
settled a ;. barrier shutting him off from
the world..
Furiously he dug, and again tried the
door; not a creak. A cry, and the
wretch dromed to his knees: with his
great ox he plowed his course to yuÂ«
bottom of the canyon. There, seated
on an uncovered boulder, he bowed
his head to his knees and panted for
breath. , >;
As the vagabond's restless and hun
gering eyes roved up and down the nar
row slit in the snowfield wherein he
was ensconced, they suddenly fell upon
a dark object lifting itself a few feet
above the snow bank several hundred
yards up the canyon. The gable and
stone chimney, of a buried hut were
dimly outlined against the white.
With a bound the man was on his
feet, trembling and half turned to flee,
Â¦when his searching backward glance
revealed no smoke filtering from the
snow-capped- chimney; not a sign of
life was there. A moment longer he
paused, and then made'hls labored way
through the snow up to the eaves of
the cabin. On one side the stout tim
bers and rough shakes of the roof alone
protruded, but on the opposite end
where the drift had been swept par
tially to one side, the upper joist of a
hidden door appeared, level with the
feet.
A Bhingie wrenched from the roof
served as a shovel. The vagabond
pawed the encumbering snow with his
hands, kicked it aside . with vicious
stabs of his feet. Like a dog. over a
bone, he muttered between clenched
teeth at the soft clinging mass until he
had finally uncovered the roughlyhewn
door to its mid-length. Then he stopped
and timidly tried the door. It yielded

through an opening in the_ sheds the
dead body of a steer which had been
fatally gored" in a crowded stock car.
Jose lived very much alone, though the
world's traffic thundered past his door
and the world's news shot over the
wires on his" cabin roof. This day he
had spoken to a man for the first time
In a month, and It had been a refresh-
Ing pleasure.
"By Jese, that verra fine cow for
pitcha da way." Pedro, the cat, turn
ed one, yellow eye on his master as he
paused by the kitchen stove and then
dropped off into a doze again. Jose
proceeded to skin some â¢ warty garlic
bulbs and continued:
"You Pedro, why not I go choppa da
cow up â brlnga de home for beefsteak,
for eoup, for evera day one ..grubâ
hey?" He crossed to the window ledge
to get his pipe, but suddenly halted,
open mouthed.
"By .Jese â iff a â da â ain't!" His
changed tone served to bring a meow
of inquiry from Pedro.
"A man, if I am a liar â da son-of-a
gun, he walk in da snowâ not In da
shed."
. Stupefied at a' spectacle so unusual,
the track walker leaned upon the win
dow ledge, his unllghited pipe cocked at
an angle in 'his beai-d and his eyes fixed
upon the distant pigmy figure wallow-
Ing the drift up the* canyon
side toward the black line of the sheds.
Curiosity /quickly superseded the
amazement in the track walker's mind.
For "what possible purpose could a man
be plowing over; twenty-foot drifts In
the dead Sierra winter. .
But the battering of a thousand ham
mers upon brazen plates, the grind of
the riven rocks in a titanic earth
"God. Jake, down the beast!" Red
dy'e fingers slipped up and tore at the
bulging eyeballs. The great body
trembled, lurched forward, and fell
with a crash to the car floor. Once
the writhing mass of struggling men
turned over, and again It fell â this
time through the open door of the car
to the ground by the track's side.
An agonized cough broke from three
pairs of . lightened lips at the heavy
impact Reddy's hold was loosened by
the fall and his hand fell upon a heavy
round stone in the roadbed. Eagerly
he grasped It and as the vagabond's
body rolled over him. he groped for
the hairy *-;rehead and dealt it a crush
ing blow. Again and again sounded
that muffled thud of stone against
bone. A spasm racked the massive
body, the bloodshot eyes rolled back
and became filmy, heels rattled for an
instant on the gravr- and then the
fizht was over.
The two brakemen lay upon their
backs, with arms Hmr'v outstretched,
until a warning whistle sounded from
somewhere ahead in the gloom and as
the creaking chain of cars moved slow
ly past they swung themselves pain
fully to the caboose platform.
"Wonder If that devil's dead?" Red
dy, with the reek of battle still in his
mouth, epat laboredly and cast his eyes
beck to the sprawled blotch by the
track side. An Instant, and it was
swallowed up in the gloom.
The tin song of the rails grew Into a
quaverâ a murmurâ ceased; the Inter
minable vault of the snowsheds was
silent. It was the silence of the rock
ribbed Sierra, muffled under its stifling
weight of winter snow. -C Â¦'Â¦-"Â¦
"Why. Til bÂ« damned! Why, Til
be damned!" murmured Reddy,
as he painfully stumbled to
his feet But Jake with a roar of an
ger rushed at the giant again and
locked arms with him. Reddy gath
ered himself together and leapt upon
the heaving back of the vagabond, his
fingers groping through the tangled
beard for the horny thorax.
They swayed, they tossed; back
with a crash against the side of the
carânow with a slide the giant was
brought to one knee; with -a sharp
whistle of breath through clenched
teeth he was up again. Fingers closed
upon his windpipe, and with a quick
turn of the head and a vicious snap
his teeth met in the lobe of the ear
pressed against his bearded cheek.
"Now, here's a go, Reddy!" Jake
hurled himself at the throat of the
vagabond. Reddy ducked and hugged
one muscle-ribbed leg. In a breath
Jake was whirled off his feet and
brought down with crushing force
over the bent back of his fellow; a
grunt barked from the throat of each
as they rolled sprawling on the car
floor.
Without a sound, the squatting be
ing arose to Its feet. Over six feet In
height, with great boles of muscle out
lined on either side of a huge neck,
a chest thick as a tree,, and arms like
the driving rods of a mountain engine,
the man standing there In the uncer
tain light of the trainmen's lantern
had the appearance of a berserk.
From out of a mat of bristling beard
two pig eyes shone green and white;
the two great arms crooked them
selves inward at the elbows and the
knotty fingers curled themselves to
ward the palms.
Both men clambered into the car.
Jake hung: the lantern on the rolling
hinge of the opposite door. Should
ers touching, the two moved cautious
ly toward the crouched figure in the
corner.
â¢"yÂ£T to hell out of here:"
4 4 f / Jake, the burly brakeman.
I #Y raised his lantern so that Its
circle of light fell upon the
vagabond, a huddled blotch
In the farthest corner of the empty
box-car. The figure did. not stir.
Two white clouds of frosty moisture
coming from his nostrils alone be
tokened that he was alive.
"Oh, Reddy! Come help me pitch
this hobo out of the empty here."
Jake had tried evicting tramps single
handed before, as the crooked brWge
of his nose bore testimony. He set
the lantern on the car floor within
the open door and blew upon his
cramped fingers. Reddy from the ca
boose came ambling through the
gloom, buttoning his Jacket and tuck
ing up his woolen wristlets.
With faltering step he began to
make his way along the track side,
leaning heavily upon the massive
stanchions for support; before him the
gloom â behind him the gloom â light
ed only by the splashes of ghostly
gTay. Was he â¢ walking through the
endless gallery of some mine in the
earth's bowels â or the alley of a
prison?
At last upon rounding a bend, a
broader streak of gray half light flick
ered through the darkness ahead. As
he drew closer he saw that a crevice
in the boards, larger than the rest,
admitted the light and the drifted
snow. He stooped and peered, blink
ing through the jagged orifice.
White dripping down into shadow
ed depths; white leaping aloft to
touch the bellying clouds; white
stretching away and away in rounded
domes and jagged pinnacles to bound
the gray horizon â it was the cloud
haven of a dead world he looked upon.
Not a film of smoke betokened the
presence of man in this unbounded
waste; not a sound broke the silence.
There lay desolation, oblivion; behind
were the four gleaming lines of
metal.
Down upon his knees dropped the
vagabond; he crawled through the
crevice, then turned and blocked up
the passage with snow. This done, he
slowly arose and turned to face the
white world with teeth clenched and
head thrown back.
Directly below him the snowy drift
dropped down into a narrow, darkly
shadowed canyon; its sinuous length
serrated by the bristling tops of black
pines. In places gray rocks broke
through the mantle of white and even
the skeleton hands of shrubs reached
forth. There would be roots at least;
the belly within him brought decision
to the mind. He started to wallow
downward through the drifts. As he
lifted fir6t one straightened leg and
then the other, the fellow grasped his
garments at his middle and lifted
them up, as if he was supporting some
impending weight-
Falling, rising again, sinking out of
sight in the smother of snow and
cleaving his way to freedom, like a
For some moments lay the strad
dling figure, face downward, in the
gravel; then slowly, with halting
movements, it arose; first to its knees
and then to its feet, swaying dizzily.
Staggering to a great square stanch
ion, the vagabond braced his back
against the timbers. To the right and
left he turned his head â gloom every
where, pierced by the four dull gleam-
Ing metal lines that bridged the ob
livion at their ends. Above, around,
were the shadowy outlines of massive
timbers, showing here and there
dashes of ghostly gray where the all
pervading snow had forced an Â¦. en
trance.
From beneath those shadow blocks
came a noise, rhythmical, compelling;
a metallic drumming, a jingling,
clanking beat : beat-beat ground into
the sick brain. Ah, those chains, those
chains â would they never cease din
ning! â¢â¢
The giant buried his face in the
gravel and tightly bound his great
arms about his ears; the fingers cut
deep Into the flesh of the interlocked
wrists. The vision passed, and silence
again settled upon the Interminable
vault of snowsheds.
Scarcely could the vagabond shield
his eyes with an uplifted arm. when
a flashing: vision of steel, glowing red
In flame light, swirled within two feet
of him. A whiff of punier t steam, a
grinding of Eteel on steel, then a black
flash followed by block after block of
shadow, silt by streaks of lightâ all
this with the speed of a meteor.
Now the roaring gave place to a
tense ringing, high pitched, incessantâ
a wall of metal under stress. To the
strident screech there was added a
minor rumble, growing louder, louder â
until It was engulfing. With an agon
ized heave the prone body was raised
upon an elbow and the racked and
bleeding head turned over a shoulder.
To the fevered eyes there came a flash
and then the spectacle of a great ball
of molten stuff bearing down upon
them from the cavern of darkness
with a sway and a tilting. Behind the
incandescent mass there streamed a
fiery gauze, fitfully illumined, rolling
In billowy masses. The roar cut like a
dull blade.
strain, all of the roars from the Pit
swollen Into one â these were the sound
throbs which crashed their way
through the giant head lying there by
the blooded stone. The fevered brain
trembled under the shock of the mad
dened pulses that galloped through its
membranes.
But with every flying crystal the
footprints of the fugitive, at first jag
ged and deep, showed rounded and
smooth of edpre, and ever that sifting
cloud of white, smoothing, obliterating.
The beards of the panting Russians
skimmed the drift as, laboring, they
followed the ever dimming tracks.
Across the frozen Bering Sea had they
followed this very trail, only to find
that a vagrant whaleship had harbored
their prey. Relentlessly they had pur
sued to San Francisco; unerringly
they had pushed the scent up to the
of these strange mountains
where death lurked. Now upon their
knees they scrambled along the same
unending trail, which grew dimmer

The Russians cursed and shook their
fists up at the blinding swirl of snow
flakes. Hlsher. higherâ dimmer and
more dim the scallops in the drif L
A scoop in the snow, a shallow
trough, a finger's scratchâ then the
smooth, unsullied white, mounting uo
and up to meet the swirlinz storm
clouds, dark with mystery.
Often driven to their knees, the four
floundering figures pressed up the
crag's side, fighting for breath, stum
bling and rising again to press ever
higher. .The mute sisn posts which
they were following mounted bit by bit
up to the very ridge of the frozen
world.
The storm which had been hanging
over the crest of the mountains now
gave Itself up to a new fury. Ones
again the air was filled with blinding
white and the rushing wind leaped
down from the ice fields, carrying with
it myriads of tiny crystal teeth, which
stung like wasps.
Down the steep slope of the canyon
the four men floundered, fighting thÂ»
clinging mow with vicious kicks and
lunges, until the gray peak of the cabin
appeared to view. Jose, with a warn
ing finger on his lips, dropped to thÂ»
rear. The two Russians drew revolvers
and eagerly breasted the drifts with
their eyes glittering under their frosted
lashes and their teeth glinting through
the Ice crystals on their beards. They
paused at the door, and then with a
loud command hurled it open, their re
volvers held at full cock before them.
Not a sound greeted their intrusionâ
the cabin was empty.
In vain did the Russians kick ther
dying embers on the hearth into a
glow, and search the aim recesses of
the cabin. Vainly did they stamp and
give tongue to sonorous oaths. Only
the log walls replied to their furious
imprecations. Jose ventured to thrust
his head in at the door and wave at
the excited officers, pointing meanwhile
in expressive pantomime to freshly
made tracks in the snow, which led
away from the cabin door. The Rus
sians comprehended and Immediately
took to the trail like hounds on tha
scent.
The tracks led off from the cabin
straight up the side of the canyon op
posite. The Jagged foot-holes -were
wide apart; the mark of a hurried fist
was occasionally interspersed between
the tracks.
Awed beyond all power of speech,
Jose mechanically reached for his cap
and knife, never taking his eye off tha
two Btiff figures standing there in their
long green coats.
"You take us down to Greasy Baker's
cabin where that hairy fellow livesâ
we're after him.'! The Sherlfra manner
was as terse aa his command.
to tne peering nead of the track walker.
As their eyes met the giant made a
shrinking motion like a cat which
crouches to receive the pounce of an
other hostile feline. Jc-se's throat closed
and step by step he retraced his path
over the trestle until safely within the
shadow of the sheds: then he broke
into a frantic run. which brought him
breathless to his door.
At last there came the equinoctial
storms. For days the gray bellying
clouds had hurried up from the south,
piling themselves up against the gran
ite spine of the range until they seem
ed ready to burst through the granite
dam and flood the world in a sea of
vapor. The shriek of the wind sounded
down through the cloven peaks like the
twang of a stretched wire. Pine trees
groaned under the strain and tossed
their tattered arms In wild desperation
at the onslaught of the tempest.
Snow fell in swirls and wild dancing
eddies ever, ever. Swiftly drifts were
piled and swiftly black rocks blown
bare. The sky was a void, the air a
blinding smother â earth was become a
dead, frozen moonflem.
In the heart of the storm there sud
denly came a hush; the clouds caught
up the myriad snow-flakes trembling
on the fall; the wind was pent in a
deadly whisper; the silence of space
settled over the frozen world crest.
"Open up in there!" Jose, nodding
over his pipe, leaped to his feet at the
summons and the kick on his door
which accompanied it. Trembling, he
unbarred the door of his cabin and put
an eye to the crack. The door was
rudely pushed into his face and three
men entered.
"I'm the Sheriff from Cisco, repre
sentln' the peace and dignity of the
United States," announced the first of
the intruders, "and these two gents is
Roosian officers from Siberia."
The Sheriff nodded toward the two
figures standing stiffly in their long
green coats and top boots. They gave
a grave nod to the astounded track
walker, then stood erect again, their
faces immobile as wood.
Jose's questioner gave his head a
knowing shake as of one who could
attest to the qualities of the "greezly
bear" in question.
"But com-a da lonsr and kill him,"
urged the terrified Jose. "Maybe he
come to my house when I sleep and
choka da eyes out me." A warning
double blast of the whistle cut short
Jose's appeal. The train crew re
turned ' to their places and the great
creaking line of cars moved awav Into
the gloom, leaving Jose alone with his
haunting fear.
The days wore on. Under the dead
gray vault of the Jumbled clouds Jose
and the vagabond livedâ two life specks
in the dull gleaming world of silence
Â¦which encompassed them. In the face
of the infinite terror of solitude which
pressed upon their souls a compelling
fear of one another separated them by
a gulf unbounded. As each gray morn
ing dawned Jose peeped timorously out
of his frosted window to see if the va
grant wisp of smoke still arose from
the bottom of the canyon. Long hours
the vagabond spent In ceaseless vigil
upon the hutch under the eaves of the
snowsheds from the snowy branch erf
a tree near his cabin. /
Once again did the two catch sight
of one another. In making his morn-
Ing tour of inspection Jose started to
cross a trestle which bridged the chasm
of a frozen torrent. His foot dislodged
some snow, and without thought Jose
paused to watch it fall into the depths
below. As he looked between the ties
he saw far below him the giant hud
dled over a black hole in the ice with
a fish line hanging taut from his great
red fist. At the shower of snow crys
tals the bearded facÂ© was turned un
"ay Jese Crl'â he go to da cow:"
Jose was all excitement now.
"You Pedro, da son-of-a-gun he getta
our cow â our steakâ our grub, if I am
a liar!" Jose had already made a reach
for his hat and started for the door, all
protest against unlawful usurpation.
But a thought struck In on him. This
man did not live anywhere around
here; he couldn't carry away the -whole
3f the carcass for any distance, so he
oiust only want a piece. He evidently
wanted it badly and would therefore
fight for it. It plainly would be best
to wait and watch.
So Jose waited and witnessed a sight
the like of which he had never before
seen. He saw the distant form gradu
ally grow into a giant as it approached.
This giant attacked the gored steer"
with an ax, hewing it as he/would a
tree. Finally he lifted the massive
hind-quarters to his shoulders ana
staggered down the fresh trail into the
shadow of the canyon. In an hour the
giant reappeared, seized the remainder
of the dead steer and dragged it down
again among the black pines at the
bottom of the slope.
Jose's cupidity steeled his courage.
Taking down from its peg* a pair of
long, stout, oaken skees, he armed him
self with a dirk and left the hut. What
had been labor to that strange forest
giant was child's play to Jose â skim
ming over the drift "on his p'olished'
skees with little effort. Hitting upon
the jagged, blood-spotted trail which
had marked the giant's passage, he fol
lowed it down the slope into the trees.
Rounding a mound of rocks Jose
saw the trail's end â it was at the
cabin of old Greasy Baker, the crazy
mirier, who was wintering down at
Grass Valley. Smoke was seeping
through the chimney and the snow
about the door was trampled. This
evidently was the home which the
stranger had appropriated.
Jose's heart beats were of no great
regularity as he shuffled a quietly
up to the door, a forced
smile of welcome on his face.
He leaned over the edge of
the drift and looked In. He saw a
great figure squatting before the fire
with its massive back turned to the
door. Jose couched.
With a scream like a trapped pan
ther the great man leaped to his feet
and whirled about. His face was livid
behind the shock of whiskers; his eyes
glowed green. Bellowing something
in a strange tongue the giant, sud
denly 'made beast, seized the ax by
his side and sprung behind the rough
table in readiness for defense.
Jose looked just once and then was
gone like a hunted rabbit.
That afternoon Jose waited impa
tiently by the watering tank until the
heavy freight from the West thun
dered In and came to a standstill be
neath the swinging pipe. Jose by the
Bide of the great driving wheels waved
excitedly at the engineer and bawled
above the hiss of the steam valve:
"Come-a da 'lone down an'- kill for
me da hairy man. He drop in from
da cloud â he tak-a da 'way da cow â
I go for get him â he ahaka da ax at
me an' yell like hell!"
Jose's excited gestures and high
pitched appeal for vengeance at
tracted a group of trainmen, who
listened to his hysterical account of
the encounter with the unknown
giant. v
"Big as a house, hair all over, pig
eyes â eh Jose?" a big brakeman
with a plaster over one eye broke In.
"Sure â da verra same; he look Ilka
da greezly bear â teeth an* eyes like
him."

Suddenly the music burst into a
wild tropical air from "Carmen," a
very revel of life and youth and lusty,
red-blooded Joy. The invalid buried
her tired eyes in the soft pillows and
her thin shoulders shook. Shaken by
the tempest of sobs, a crutch that had
been leaning against the bedside rat
tled to the floor.
Back of the large hostelry and
across a narrow alley a white girlish
face banked with pillows looked out
wistfully from the one narrow window
of a third-floor back at these evi

VANDYNE stood very stiff and
straight, with folded arms. Out
lined against the background of
dull sky and gray water, his fig
ure seemed almost heroic. Despite his
clothes of conventional cut there was
something suggestive of the bronze
age about himâ some hint of rugged,
primitive strength. Miss Desboro real
ized suddenly that the mask of conven
tional restraint had been thrown aside
and that there stood before her all of
the rugged, primitive man that lay be
neath that mask. I
A moment ago she had been inclined
to laugh; now there was a strange sen
sation tugging at her heart, but wheth
er it was pity or fear she could not telj.
This was the stage of the game she
generally found most enjoyable â this
olimax, where she always expressed
her surprise and sorrow and bound up
the wounded heart with the balm of
good, sisterly advice. She had particu
larly enjoyed the anticipation of giving
this sisterly advice to Vandyne, but
somehow the realization bade fair to
fall short of the anticipation. Vandyne's
eyes seemed to search the secret cor
ners of her soul, and beneath that
calm, stony scrutiny she was stunned
and helpless. She seemed to feel rather
than .hear Vandyne's deep voice say
ing with quiet bitterness:
"I congratulate you, Miss Desboro.
I have seen the game before, but
never played like this. You have thor
oughly mastered all its fine points."
She looked up with an appealing
glance. That same appealing glance
had saved the situation for her many
times before this. But for once It
failed; the primitive man before her
was unmoved by Its eloquence.
"Do you think you are quite fair
to me?" she asked with an attempt at
hauteur that fell pathetically flat.
Vandyno smiled slowly. "Do you
think" you have been fair to me?" he
said.
The girl pulled her gloves nerv

"I don't know what you call fair,"
she said. "You grasp at straws; you

THE
END OF IT
IN AN
OPERA BOX
On their way home in the carriage,
when Eunice had been told the little
cripple's story, she laughed tenderly
in her new found Joy, so nearly lost,
and, with one Jeweled band in John's
and the other caressing" the young
girl's pala -cheek, said with a confi
dence that the future proved not un
founded: â¢
"I shall take care of her, her voice,
her future and ' her back. I know a
great doctor who can straighten out
this little' one's tangles, even as she
has been the means of unsnarling the
dreadful knot In my web of fate."
John reached out an audacious
thumb. and pressed the button on the
wall. As ' the box was enveloped in
darkness he crushed her close in his
arms, unable to say one word.
"Jack," she whispered, "if you don't
forgive me and love me I shall die. I
never dreamed till mamma made me
send you away how dreadfully I cared
â and I never was engaged to Billy
Launders at alL I couldn't beâ not if
the whole family rose up to slay me."
The orchestra began the overture to'
the next actâ the wild gypsy motif
of the Immortal opera rose and bathed
them In Its malting torrents of love
made Into music. The little cripple
was leaning over the edge of the box
waiting breathlessly for the curtain
tc rise on the familiar scene she loved.
"Jack, darlingâ hear It! That music
has been killing me till you came! Do
you remember that night we "
Tho woman turned a lovely pale face
up to him entreatingly without speak

had destroyed her poise, woman of the
world though, she was, and left her as
excited and embarrassed as a school
girl. There were traces of tears about
the dark eyes; hollow from sleepless
ness. Her soft, white throat worked in
the stress 6f emotion and her bosom
rose and fell pantingly.
At last she found her voice. It was
low and tremulous, and at the thrill
ing sweetness of it the man's heavy
heart pounded like a mad thing behind
his Immaculate shirt front.
"When Wixton ushered his charge
into the bqx he found, to his surprise,
that the place was unlighted. The cur
tain had just closed on the first act,
and the solitary occupant was shrink
ing Into the farthest corner as though
seeking to avoid observation.
John reached out to press the elec
tric button and turned in the blaze of
light to confront the woman who had
refused him the week before. His lips
tightened and his face went white. ' .
"Eunice! You here?"
came out ill and went away. After a
bit she came back with a ticket for a
seat In this one."
She told him quite simply, with a lit
tle pathetic quaver In her' voice, about
her ambition to be a great singer; how
she had fallen through a trapdoor left
carelessly open by the stage hands one
night after the opera was over, and had
been in the charity ward of a hospital,
where they had not seemed able to cure
her; how she could walk only a, little
way without hurting.
When they reached the opera-house
the first act was nearly over.
Â¦Wixton gathered up her slight form
and strode up the wide stairway as if
his burden were a baby. At the door
of the box he halted. It was slightly
ajar. "Sold the other seats?" he ques
tioned of the usher.
"Only one, to a lady," answered
that worthy, and volunteered further
the whispered information that "she
was a queer' oneâ came with a party
in the fourth box farther down, and

self; the master said so; and now my
back's hurt and I'll never sing againâ

and hear it\all again I think maybe I
could bear it better; but to be penned
in here all the. time like a rat with the
snappers of a trap caught over his back
âit's tooâ" The rest was lost in the
enfolding pillow.
The man in the darkened window
across the way suddenly stood up,
turned on the light and squared his
shoulders like a soldier ready for march-
Ing. 'Til do itl" he said grimly. "I'll not
run away like a cowardâ I'll face this
thing out. I've got to go through it
some time and I might as well begin
now. I'll go right to that same box and
fight it out. And, what's more, I'm go
ing to take that child along. She'll
probably look a fright and people will
stare â but hang the people!"
He took his hat and overcoat and
hurried from the room. At the office he
stopped to give an order for an auto
cab.
Twenty minutes later he was bowling
toward Broadway with his strange lit
tle companion still breathless over the
wondrous angel in evening clothes
whose determination had carried all
opposition before him. Even the fat
landlady had been subdued into defer
ence and helDed to dress her quickly so

It was all very well to humor a Jeal
ous fiend through a mistaken sense of
endeavor to make him happy at any
sacrifice. It was all very well to enjoy
forgiveness for sins ne\ r er committed.
This and other foolish things that a
woman guileless in herself might do
puts a deadly weapon into the hands of
a man whose love were worse than
valueless, whose honor worse than
questionable.
The secret may ha kept inviolate
for ten or even fifteen years, the giri
may marry a man worthy of her. and
be happy In her home, surrounded by
her children with all the blessinss of
a love that is of her life a part, when
this man will loom ud as a shadow,
ani remembering the old days, en
deavor to reassert his Influence, or he
may hold that foolish confession over
her head like an ill-balanced rock that
a moment's swaying: will cause to fall
and crush her. If he has manhood
enough not to betray her, yet the
dread lest he should will haunt her.
If he did tell the husband, and f she
attempted to explain â no man on
earth would believe her.
And all this comes of a sensible
woman loving devotedly and unselfish
ly a jealous brute masquerading as a
man. The sentimental nonsense that
a girl would not believe that a man
loved her were he not Jealous is the
veriest rot. A jealous lover is bad
enough, but a Jealous husband is
worse than a dentist's file on a sensi
tive tooth, and if young people quar
rel beforehand they will come to
blows later.
Love should mean happiness, and if
two people who think they are in love
are always quarreling there can be
no hope for happiness.
And, girls, don't think you can be in
love with a man who keeps the misery
always at high pressure, because you
really are not. in love â you are only
hysterical.
Ha does not love â he only feeds hid
own egotism on all that is best for a
woman to give. He cares only for him
self, and the woman who fancies that
honor plays any part in his life will
wake up to find that his supreme egot
ism has spoiled not only his own life
but has left burning scars on the lives
of others.
done her. not only at the time, but may
crop up even ten years later to wreck
her happiness.
A man so warned will never respect
any woman, consequently her confi
dences will never be held sacred.
THE WAYS
AO A
MAN WITH A MAID
ESX KATE THXSON I v tARR
IF one sludie3 human nature about
them there is no need for the lurid
fates of fiction to Incite sensation.
The confidences of young people
furnish chapters in most extravagant
romances that would not be believable
did not circumstance confirm the state
ment.
The Influence or a man over a woman
whom he v simply makes a fool of is
something beyond the ken of human
understanding, and yet the most bril
liant and noblest women In the world
are often the first to succumb to the
suave Influence of polished rascality.
A man's excuse is his love that makes
him so fiendishly, insanely jealous as
to be totally irresponsible- Now, that
kind of love never brings any happi
ness, and Is not worth the price that
a woman pays in heartaches and tears.
Unfortunately a woman will often <lo
or say anything for the purpose of re
taining the regard of a man who Is not
fit to po'.ish her shoes. And the Jealo.s
fiend who exacts such tribute does not
make her cr himself any the happier
after the trouble Is brewed.
It is a mistake to suppose that jeal
ousy Is a proof of love and that th?y
who are not Jealous know nothing of
love. Jealousy la a proof of a warped
mind that is so distorted by suspicion
as to have no confidence In the faith,
truth or virtue of any woman, and she
who marries a jealous brute plans for
herself a life of misery that knows no
compensation.
If the woman appears happy for the
moment the jealous fiend attributes It
to some other cause. No matter how
trivial the incident, how Insignificant
the thoughtless word or act. the man
so constituted can exaggerate it into
every crime of the decalogue.
As for humoring euch a creature, the
woman who attempts it will find her
hands and heart overburdened with
sorrow. , _
Strange to say it Is often the most
sensible women who become the very
tools of these men.
A man who does not believe in a good
woman is not fit to associate with the
lowest that trails a city's slums. No cir
cumstance or combination of circum
stances could plant In his heart any
seed of faith. To him a woman Is al
ways merely waiting for temptation to
come her way and be welcomed. One
of the noblest, most self-sacrificing
girls it was ever my good fortune to
know hides In her heart a history al
most beyond belief. Her home environ
ment was of the purest, she cared noth
ing for the society of men, but was one
of the brightest, happiest and truest
v.omen ever known.
Having to earn her own living, she
came in contact with many men, who
entertained for her the most unbounded
admiration. And then cane other days
when another came Into her life. At
f.rst all went well, but soon his jeal
ousy became a horror. There was never
a happy moment. He could not be with
her at any time without reproaching
her for all sorts of things having abso
lutely no foundation. Every man with
whom her business affiliation obligated
Intercourse was an object of his sus
picious tirades. Despite It all, she loved
him devotedly, breaking up her friend
ships, and even discarding the friends
of her whole life. She was never happy
either with him through his mania, nor
away from him through her love.
One day, when indulging in an outing,
he was more than ever bitter, for no
than a fiend incarnate. His forgive
ness was something beautiful in his
magnanimity. He had simply tortured
her into humoring him, at a price that
should have made any woman shudder.
For a few days his tenderness was a
poem and then his exactions became
greater than before, until, in. self-de
fense, as much as the girl loved him,
the final break had to come.
The man has paid devoted attention
to other women, who he savs have al-
ways deceived him, but there Is a
strong suspicion in my mind that they
found him out and gave him his conge.
It may seem a paradox, but the more
sensible a girl In other -respects the
greater fool will love make of her. The
girl whom everybody considers a fool Is
very apt to make a sensible marriage,
from the fact that she Is prone to ex
treme selfishness, which leads her to
look out beautifully for, No. L,

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.There is another deviation laterally
frcm the straight line shown by a rifle
bullet v and , more pronounced in rifles
having a qHilck twist. This is called
"drift." It is a lateral movement, due
to the spin of the bullet on its long
axi3. As the bullet Is constantly fall
ing In its flight the under surface
meets with, more air. resistance than
the upper and the bullet therefore
tends to roll laterally on this denser
air, so that a rifle having a right-hand
direction to -its pitch of rifling will
cause a bullet to drift to the right,
while one with a left-hand twist will
drift to the ' left.
bullet, therefore, is always In a curved
line.
When we increase the proportion
ate length of our bullets and use a
quicker twist or rifling, it becomes nec
essary to harden the bullet by the ad
dition of tin or antimony, so that it
will hold on to the rifling uid not be
blown straight through the barrel
without following the groves â strip
ping, riflemen call it. But when we
reach a certain point In lengthening
the bullet and increasing the pitch of
the rifling, no alloy of lead is sufficient
to give good results. Therefore in the
modern, high power rifle the bullet is
made up of a core of lead, with a Â¦
jceket of very tough metal, generally ,
an alloy of copper and nickel, and
the tough jacket holds on to the rifling '
so well that we are enabled to fire (
charges of highly explosive compounds
behind the bullets, giving nearly '
double the velocity that it was pos- i
sible to obtain with the old black
powder rifle. The modern, high power
rifle is therefore one which fires a jack- i
eted bullet.very long In oroportion to,
its diameter, by means of a charge of
smokeless powder several times as '
strong as black powder, with nearly |
double the velocity obtained with lead
bullets and black powder, and as a re- '
suit of the long bullet and high and,
â¢ well sustained velocity the curve de
scribed by the bullet is much nearer a I
straight lineâ "Its trajectory is flatter," <
its penetration greater and its range
farther. - <
whether with military or match rifles,
involves not only good holding, but also
a knowledge of the effects of disturbing
factors, such as changes of light, wind,
barometric pressure, temperature, etc.
It must not be supposed, however,
that schuetzen rifle snooting Is of no
value to riflemen who aspire to hon
ors with the military or long-range
rifle. â¢ It has the advantage of using
very cheap ammunition, it is general
ly done on ranges provided with fa
cilities that insure comfort to the
"shooter during even the coldest and
most disagreeable weather and it Is the
best possible training for fine holding.
Therefore it is far better for the rifle
men who would keep in practice to
uhoot 50 or 100 shots at 200 yards, say
once a week or two weeks during the
winter with a schuetzen rifle than to
abandon the game altogether during
cold weather. .There are a large num
ber of civilian riflemen who confine
themselves almost entirely to this kind
of shooting, and who are, neverthe
less, very well posted and skillful rifle
men, able to take up other branches
of rifle shooting at short notice; and
their skill in holding and intimate
knowledge of many, of the technicali
ties of the rifle, . learned by long and
careful practice with their own weap
ons, certainly puts them far in the
lead of the novice, no -matter what
other branch of rifle shooting they
adopt.
But It is in long- range shooting, un
doubtedly, that the rifleman finds the.
highest development of the sport. And
In late; years, since.' the advent of
the modern smokeless powder riije of
high power and small caliber, It is
gratifying to note in our. American,
as well as In the British weapons, that
the military, and match rifles have ap
proached very near to each other. In
the old black powder days the match
rifle, with ita : paper-patched bullet,
heavy : charge 1 of t powder and necessity
of cleaning after each shot, was a. far
different weapon than " the military
rifle. In those days to attempt to shoot
1000 yards with n military rifle would
have been considered the - height of

Walter G. Hudson, M. D., of New
York City, president of the Man
hattan Rifle and Revolver Asso
ciation and recognized as one of the
highest authorities on the subject.
Target shooting as a sport has been
more or less sharply divided into match
flfle shooting and military rifle shoot
ing. The points in which the match
rifle differs from the military are .its
lighter trigger pull, finer sights and
better finish, and, in addition, various
departures from military styles are al
lowed in the way of special attach
ments, buttplates, heavier weight of
barrel, etc. The match rifle also is de
veloped with accuracy as its chief aim,
and accuracy at the particular distance
it is to be used; while the military rifle
has to be adapted to all ranges.^and be
strongly built and serviceable under
adverse conditions, even if at the ex
pense of some accuracy.
In view of these considerations it is
scarcely to be wondered at that the
target rifle developed with the sole ob
ject of shooting from the offhand po
sition at 200 yards, as In vogue by the
German-American (schuetzen) clubs,
should differ so much from the ling
range match and military rifle. The
schuetzen rifle has changed but little
in many years, and In its present form
is probably as near perfection for Its
purpose as it is possible to get. Most
of the modern schuetzen rifles still use
black powder and In the finest Ameri
can makes the bullet isj?ushed down
from the muzzle as in tne old muzzle
loading rifles. They are extremely, ac
curate, and the shooting is generally
done on sheltered ranges, so that this
kind of shooting brings the game down
to merely one of skillful Holding. ' .
On the other hand, the long range
match rifle has of late years ap
proached more and more closely
to the military.^ so much bo that
mist of the match rifles now in
use in England are merely mil
itary rifles fitted with fine target sights.

folly. . But now there is little differ
ence in the scores made with match
and military riiies at these long ranges.
Indeed our Krag, when a good barrel
can be selected and when the drag is
removed from the trigger pull, is, in
the opinion of many expert riflemen,
fully capable at the midland long
ranges of holding its own against the
finest match, rifles that can be pro
duced. There are few target sites that
afford better aiming than the 1901
model Krag sight; and while it is true
that the, target sights, as a rule, are
farther apart and adapted to the back
position, the modern high-power rifle
seems to shoot so much better from the
prone position as to more than com
pensate for any slight advantage the
target ' sights mi^ht thus gain over our
military sight. A glance over the rec
ords of those long-range matches of
recent years that have been open to
both military and match rifles ,wlll
show that in 90 per cent of the matches
the Krag has come out victorious. In
deed, the remarkable development of
accuracy in the American high-power
rifle within the past few years has not
been due to any particular refinement
in the weapon or sights, , but solely to
the improvement in the bullet. and in
.the more uniform measuring of
powder charges.
The first thing that may be taken as
true of all projectiles, no matter how
thrown, Is that they fall toward the
earth an soon as the support ' is re
moved from .them, Just the same as
Â¦though they were not projectiles. But
even while they are falling, the energy
applied is driving them ahead. From
this it will . be clear that no weapon,
however powerful, can drive a bullet

holding out her hand to. Jocelyn, os
tensibly sympathetic, but with a gleam
of satisfaction in her eye.
"I don't," Jocelyn said stout.'y;
"Aunty Berintha never promised to
make me her heir. She did all she
said and rr. re â "ave me my education
âwith a lot of frills in the way of ex
tras â dressed me wellâ and gave me
also a chance of earning her money.
I wouldn't take it â "
"Why, I â I don't understand â " Amy
began. Jocelvn laughed softly. "The
earning would have been easy â to some
girls," Bhe said. "It only meant being
a missionary. You see Aunty felt that
she herself ought to have goneâ she
.thought she had heard a call that way
â ;but her terror of men and water
was such that she never could venture
to answer It. She wanted me to fill
the gap which she thought she had
left in the ranks. Then, too, the poor
old dear knew I'd spend her money If
I got it without the missionary career
in having good times. And Bhe did so
hate good times! She simply couldn't
be happy unless she was very miser
able,"
"You stayed with her nine years,"
Amy said in a voice of awe. Jocelyn
smoothed out her black gown, and
said cheerfully: "Yes â and I'm glad
of. It Toward the last she clung to
me pitifully â called me her- comfort
and all that. But it broke me all up
to have her ask my pardon for the
will. As though I' had a right to -be
hurt over It 'I've lived so useless,
child, I had to do a little good at the
very last' she said. So her dear mis
sionaries got everything but the place
and the family silver â they went to a
Challoner, down in Texas, the last of
the name. She hoped he would come
back to live on the place. Somehow,
In spite of all her crankiness, she kept
the feeling of race. I'm not real blood

mother's grandchild-: "
"When is he coming â this Texan?"
Amy interrupted. . /
Jocelyn laughed roguishly. "Not at
all, I suspect Amy-Mamy, you'll have
to put up with Frank Palmer after
all. For even If Stephen Challoner
should come, he is likely to bring a
Mrs. Challoner along. Early and often
la the Texas motto when it comes to
matrimony â and he's ail of 35."

she said severely, but with twinkling
eyes. "I don't deny grudging Frank
to you â what woman could? But you
have possession, which Is nine points
of the law, not to speak of vested in
terests â you two were betrothed In
the cradle, I've always heard, by your
respective fathers."
"Oh, that was all a Joke!" Amy said
â but blushed and bridled delightedly.
Amy was a pretty enough girl, unless
Jocelyn were by to put her out of court.
Jocelyn was tall and twenty, light on
her feet, lithely rounded, a figure of
Brace, vital everywhere, most of all In
her peach-tinted face and laughing
eyes. In the three weeks since she had
come home, she had subjugated half of
Lynnville â wjmen no Tess than men.
What wonder that she had swept
Frank Palmer off his feet? '
He was a rich man's only child,
spoiled of course, but a decent fellow
enough, dutiful to his father, and ten
derly affectionate toward his invalid
mother. He had Intended to marry
Amy on purpose to please his mother,
who was fond of the girl and had
g,rown to depend on her greatly. Now
he had decided "she would be much
fonder of Jocelyn before six months
were out â how could she help it? While
the two girls talked of him he was say
ing this to the sick woman, who an

tall, sunburned fellow who stood Ir
resolute upon a corner.
"No harm doneâ rather . good," the
stranger said in answer to his apolo
gies. "At least I reckon so â it gives me
a chance to speak to you, without
seeming like a confidence man. I ought
to be' ashamed to say It, but the fact
isâ I'm lost. Lost In Lynnvilleâ where
I was born a long time ago.. The Lynn
ville I remember was another sort of
place. Used to be a public square,
where the turnpike went down toward
the riverâ with a market house, and

"They've- gone .out to meet the rail
road," Frank explained, smiling In
spite of himself.
The stranger said: "H'm!" then
plunged into the middle of things with:
"Sayâ what- sort of a proposition is this
Craig girlâ Miss Jocelyn? You're bound
to know her if you live here."
"She's most adorable," Frank an
swered, smiling. . - â¢ â¢ .
The stranger looked at him, also
smiling, but shrewdly. / "It's plain she's
run her brand on you, young man," he
said. "So you up and tell me who you

Â¦""How is that?" Frank asked.
Challoner laughed. "Why that

ever I was rightly cut in." he said.
"Ain't that about right?"
"I don't know," B'rank Interrupted,
"but," doggedly, "if you'll come along
with me, we'll very soon find out"
"So! You're going to see her!" Chal
loner ejaculated with a whistle, then,
rubbing his hands, "but you haven't
told me a word about yourself."
Frank ran Into a brief account of
himself as they swung along the street
Challoner listened attentively, and at
the close asked: "Now, one thing
more â are you right sure you ain't
mortgaged property? I don't see how
you can help being â living here where
folks can't do much but marryâspe

noting Frank's frowning flush. "Now
you speak upâ the whole truthâ before
we go a step further together."
"Would you ruin your life to Dlease
other people?" Frank demanded.
Challoner looked at him narrowly.
"No man ruins his life except by doing
wrong," he said. "Tell me the whole
tale â then I can Judge."
. "Gee! But you are in a sort of a
box!" he said when, he had heard the
taleâ then with a swift smile. "But It
oughtn't to be hard to get you out â
with two men wanting to' marry, and
two women ready to be persuaded."
, "You don't mean," Frank began,
reaching for the other's hand. Chal
loner returned the clasp, but said
oracularly: "Wait until I've seen 'em
both â no buying piga In a poke for
yours truly." Then there was silence
until they stood side by side upon the
Craig piazza, shaking hands with the
two young women, whose conclave
they had Interrupted. Five minutes
later Challoner managed to wink at
Frank unseen. And when, after sup
per, they marched away arm in arm,
he burst out: "It's all rlcrht â mighty

problems on the board; then some gen

quainted with the subtleties of revolu
tion these two propositions would ap
pear to be more or less opposed to
each other, but the. International As
sociation could swallow . them both
without winking and ask for more.
Religion, however, was P. Rousseau's
favorite field. He was young and he
hadn't given a great deal of thought to
the subject, but he was gifted with a
greater amount of pure and unadulter
ated intuition to the square inch than
most men even suspect in the course of
their whole lives, and he could settle
the vexing problems of free will and
predestination, could decide whether
all children were damned or only the
neighbor's, and 'could discourse with
amazing fluency on the idea of the im
mortality of thet soul as a product of
evolution. To have heard him talk
would have made vou feel sorry for
St Augustine, Erasmus, the late M.
Luther, Andrew Lang and all the other
gentlemen who thought they had some
ideas about things in general. He knew
it" all and he wasn't a bit backward
about telling the world, either.
All the things which we have men
tioned happened when P. Rousseau was
in the springtime of life referred to
above, somewhere. We have described
them with this wealth of detail simply
to show the ravages of the bacillus of
youth which we are Investigating (see
also above somewhere.) It must not be
Buppo::d that he did any of the things
which h'e contemplated. No doubt he
believed In his theories seriously
enough at the time that he confided
them to a cold and more or less unfeel
ing world, but tempora usually mutan
ters to a considerable extent Observe
how It mutantered with P. Rousseau.
By the time he was 45 he had come
into two or three inheritances that had
been. hanging over, his .head and had
settled down with a wife and children
and all the other appendages of respec
tability. To look, at _â¢ him now you
would never suspect that he was the
"hot-blooded youth who had got up
early every morning to plot before
breakfast and had pulled of a world
shaking revolution every other day-
"Y OUTH Is the springtime of life:
I J this is a discovery of my own
>-^ and Is patented in the United
*â "* States, the British Empire and
on Ixmg Island. It Is also a disease
which carries with it Its own remedy;
that is a sad fact which any one is at
liberty to use if he can do anything
"tvith it. The germ of this disease has
not been isolated as yet. but the ex
tensive researches which are being con
ducted in our elaborately equipped lab
oratory for the Investigation of va
rious profound problems which no one
cares anything about and wouldn't un
derstand anyway are expected to pro
duce results In this direction which will
astonish the world. News editors are
hereby notified that our regular days
for astonishing the world are Tues
days, Fridays and Sundays; on all oth
er days we are resting from our prodig
ious labors.
Having thus warned the public that
\we are about to unfold a great and far
reaching theory we shall proceed to
our task. P. Rousseau Smlthers was
afflicted with this disease in its most
violent form and his symptoms should
be of great Interest to any one who Is
making a study of the manifestations
of youth. The most important indica
tion of his mental state was the general
feeling that any man who had passed
the age of 40 was a proper candidate
for the scrap heap. He was not pre
pared to go the length of putting such
old fogies out f l their misery entirely,
but he would have them realize their
general uselessness. As long as they
behaved themselves and t didn't appear
on the streets after dark he was per
fectly willing that they should be al
lowed to pay the bills contracted by the
younger members of the community,
but they were to have no voice in the
expenditure of the world's visible sup
ply of circulating medium beyond sign
ing checks and* indorsing promissory
notes.
Another symptom which should be
noted carefully by all Inquiring stu
dents was that the affairs of the world
were all wrong end to. Society was
out of Joint and until the young men
of the country were given a free hand
In reducing the fracture It would con
tinue to be lame, halt and blind. This
is a belief peculiar to youth all the
world over ar " It is only because It
was most pronounced In P. Rousseau
that we take him as an example. The
first thing that must be done, accord-
Ing to P. Rousseau, was to overturn
the governments of the world and-es
tablish them on a new basis. He was
not exactly an anarchist of the be
whlskered type, but he was of the opin
ion that every man should have the
sort and amount of government that be
wanted. If it was a monarchy, then
he should be allowed to go off in a
corner and monarch to his heart's con
tent If a republic was the sort of
government that his thirsty soul
panted for, no one should be permitted
to stand in the way. The principal
consideration in the mind of P. Rous
seau was that the fact that an insti
tution wa.s in existence was a suffi
cient reason for rolling it up and
chucking It out of the window. Any
thing concocted by a lot of graybeards
who never swore at a telephone girl,
or got themselves run over by an auto
mobile was sure to be worn out* and
generally NO. "
Another of P. Rousseau's symptoms,
and one that is peculiar to the disease
from which he suffered, was that he
believed that he was the first man to
stumble on all these Interesting the
ories.- He did-**- realize that there are
always a certain number of men, gen
erUly young, who are agin the gov
ernment, no matter what it is, simply
because It happens to be the govern
ment If It were anything else they
would still be agin It, even If they had
constructed it themselves.
By way of demonstrating his sympa
thy with all movements for the de
struction of everything In . sight P.
Rousseau allied himself with the

(~*f OCIAli diversions other than be
'Ovlng a boarder in the home of
tjm7 boss were open to me at
A^ Omaha during the merry winter
season. I was a popular young fel
low In icy set; so one Saturday night
I cut oct the keg and shop stories to
be among those present at a Polish
wedding. Up to that time I never had
witnessed a marriage ceremony, but
was more or less familiar with some
of the dire results.
Herder, failure to provide, suicide
and alimony, I knew, often followed
the golden chime of the wedding: bell,
but that was the fault of the newspa
pers. They had no advice to lovers,
no department of health stunts for
girls and how to manage husbands In
those uncouth .days. The high con
tending parties knew little of - each
other's moods and temperaments and
so rushed blindly Into compacts pro
ductive of much woe. Thanks to the
benign Ideas of modern Journals and
the industry of their matrimonial
dope compilers we seldom hear of
troubles In that line. All hands now
live happily ever after. j
The gentleman who took the count
In this Instance was an honored mem
ber of our staff In the foundry and
the only Pole in the bunch. With keen
insight into the social requirements of
his set Mr. blevltsky pulled off his
nuptials on Saturday night This Is
an open date In the workaday world,
leaving guests the whole of next day
to sleep off the effects of weddings and
other functions.
Mr. Blevltsky was a nice but some
what unhealthy looking young man.
He had an abundant crop of pimples,
a nose like a window awning and no
chin to speak of. I often thought If
Mr. Blevltsky would mobilise his pim
ples In the right place he could build
himself a pretty respectable site for
the knookout blow. For days prior
to the ceremony and while tolling In
the shop he did nothing but laugh.
What it was about I never did learn.
No doubt Mr. Blevltsky knew his part
It behooved any man In his position
to lay up laughs against a time when
this form of diversion becomes naught
but a melancho 1 " memory.
My unfortunate shopmate perpetrat
ed his wedding in a. saloon In the Pol
ish settlement. There was nothing to
distinguish the saloon from places, of
similar resort which are built by .the
mile and sawed Off In sections to suit
the needs of publicans, grocers, shoe
dealers and haberdashers In new
towns. Mr. Blevitsky. chartered the
place for a long term of hours and in
stalled a band consisting of two cor
nets and one slide trombone. .The
happy man had served one' wedding
breakfast! dinner and supper and had
set out sausages and. ice cream for
another breakfast Sunday morning
when the police felt obliged to be
among" those present
The nuptial feast raged all day Sat
urday and had several laps to go when
I butted in at 10 O'clock that night.
Yellow lights blinked dimly in the fog
gy atmosphere and the bridegroom's
special band was tooting away on an
Independent scale. Everything In the
saloon was free by courtesy "of Mr.
Blevitsky. Large numbers of married
men were there, accompanied by their
invalids, and scores of little children
played among the sawdust and cigar
butts on the floor. There were young
people, too, but I didn't know any
Poles or Polish. However, Mr. Blevlt
sky pressed me to his white waistcoat
and treated to a bottle of pink pop in
the presence of the multitude, which
put me in right . with the elite. The
bridegroom was quite drunk and
bleary, yet affable withal.
His bride was a small, swart maiden,
with a little face and big hair, and she
had on all the clothes she ever owned â
a habit they acquire coming over in the
steerage.. When Mr. Blevitsky formal
ly presented me the bride arose, made
a weary bow and sank limply into her
seat. Mr. Blevitsky beamed with love,
beer and tenderness. Placing. one arm
around my neck he drew me aside and
told me about the bride In accents that
left no doubt of his absorbing passion.
She was .very tired, Tie said. Accord
ing to her wont and against his express
order, she had gone out at 6 o'clock
that morning with a gunny sack to
pick up coal on tho railroad track, But
what could a man do? Bhe had come
back with more than a bushel and they
were married at 10 o'clock. Moreover,
he. had secretly Inspected the' coal and
there wasn't a single clinker among it.
In a further burst of sloppy confidence
Mr. Blevitsky opined his wife was a
Jewelâ a woman of whom any man
might be proud.
Everybody danced, after a fashion,
and then sidestepped to the bar the
minute the band gave out. Mr. Ble
vitsky superintended the; whole busi
ness and sopped up most of the loose
liquid on the counter Jwlth the sleeves
of his wedding trousseau. . He was the
life of the party. Â¦ For fmirie, I ; rubbered

me for anhpur'or so when It dawned
on me that she was the Lady with the
High Insteps. Like a statue she posed
â her slippered feet .thrust forward
so as to star the Insteps.' The tension
In. her limbs necessary to arch' the feet
was no great I could see the muscles
bulging' under the ball dress, and the
loose hair about her temples was sub
merged'in moisture. Many a man has
stumbled over the high Instep to his

hand, battled nobly for a causa shroud

bridegroom sailed in and did the best

When the lights were all knocked

In front of the church.
The only place a fellow can get
wedded without police surveillance Is
in one of those spots untouched by
the blight of civilization. Be he mil
lionaire or mutt, this getting married
is a dangerous operation, which
should only be attempted as a last
extremity, when ill or out of work. In
time I may lose my number and de
cide, to pay some good woman a sal
ary to make trouble for me, but that
possibility is too remote to worry
about.
After the wedding I applied myself
to /molding with . renewed Industry.
One of my first plays was to pick out
a preceptor â a sedate and finished
mechanic of mature years, whose

thus become perfect Mr. Spruce,
champion all-around sand pounder,
the man who made the large flywheels
and dry sand cylinders, filled the bill

two months I was a second edition of
this Royal- Arch molder In mechani
cal grace, style and execution. I even
Â¦pat like Mr. Spruce.
Anything he did I did, and felt I
couldn't go wrong. Mr. Spruce saw
he had scored a touchdown back of
goal with a lobster, and the knowl
edge pleased him, for he hypnotized
me with tales about an engine bed
plate he once cast In Sacramento that
weighed sixty-four tons. Helpers
hoisted him in and out of the
sand mold with a derrick for a
couple of weeks, he said, and when
the plate .was cast they had to tear
the shop down to get It outside.
That Job placed him in the front row
of the peach class and I begged Mr.
Spruce | for his photograph. What
Henry Irving Is to the stage butler this
master molder was to me and I fairly
worshiped the sand he handled.
One evening after work Mr. Spruce,
being a fatherly man with a good heart
and kindly impulses, asked me to his
home to supper. As we left the shop
on the outskirts of the town a freight
train came along. We climbed to the
top and rode half a mile or so to the

ON AND OFF THE BREAD WAGON
BEING HARD LUCK TALES AND DOINGS OF AN AMATEUR HOBO(PUZZLED HANGING POSTERS)â
Unless the posters are .mounted on
heavy cardboard, . I know of no
way to dispense with tacks. A
great deal depends - upon your
room. If it is strictly toster, a
pretty' way of hanging them 4 Is by
colored ribbons from the mouldinsr.
For instance, run a wire or cord across
the back of the picture and fasten the
ribbons: to each side and suspend the
poster as you would any ordinary pic
ture. As the color scheme is bright, the
ribbons will help to carry out the idea.
If you do not care for this, select a
copper wire. and. by the way. some of
them are almost Invisible, and run a
single piece to the moulding. Either
thusiastic bather becomes an offensiv6
spectacle when she exposes herself to
such an extent that the skin Is blis
tered and peeling the greater part of
the summer. â¢ A great many persons
labor under the impression that it is
exceedingly smart to bring back to
town the brand of summer outing
and will suffer much to accomplish
this. The reckless exposure which was
a fad a season or two since was car
ried to such a vulgar digree that re
fined people declined to longer ex
pose themselves to the elements in
this reckless manner. Society women
found to their sorrow that it was a
most expensive fad, as it took not only
a good many dollars, but hours of pa
tient labor to restore the texture of
the 8km to any semblance of refine
ment. Those who could not afford the
luxury of massage by a professional
were little short of wrecks so far as
their faces were concerned for weeks
after the vacation season closed. A
fine coat of tan is very picturesque,
but it should never exceed the becom
ing shade. < By the exercise of a few
simple precautions, which will' not in

The average man doesn't see an this

true sense of the word. While it may

good thing, and really, don't you know,
no one could expect it of her. In

article thajt she is to take to her new
home has been fashioned for her and

reason that she didn't know how to do
It herself or didn't care to * take the
trouble.
LUCY (Birth Stones).â One good au
thority gives the following as the gems
symbolic of the months and their sig
nificance: -January,- jacinth or hya
cinth, symbolizing constancy and fidel
ity: February, amethyst, .peace of mind
and sobriety; March, bloodstone, cour
age and success in dangerous enter
prise: April, sapphire or diamond, re
pentance and innocence; May, emerald,
success in 'ove; June, agate, long life
and health: July, cornelian, care of
evils resulting from forgetfulness;
August, sardonyx or onyx, conjugal
felicity; September, chrysolite, preser
vation from folly or cure for folly; Oc
tober, opal, hope; November, topaz,
fidelity and friendship, and December,
turquoise or ruby, brilliant success.
TO ERADICATE MILDEW (Young
Housekeeper).â Fine table linen, towels
and similar articles should never be
thrown into the clothes hamper while
damp, for they will mildew, stain and
be malodorous. Expose such articles
to the air until perfecly dry and they
may then be put away in safety. To
bleach damaged articles first wash the
-pieces clean in warm water containing
very little soap. Do not scald or boil,
for heat will set the stains. Prepare a
solution of chloride of lime by dissolv
ing at the rate of two tablespoonfuls ot
lime to each pailful of lukewarm water.
Let -it- stand ''for several hours, strain
into a tub and soak the articles in this
solution for an hour or more, until the
spots of mildew disappear; .then' rinse
thoroughly, blue and dry in the sun.
This process will rarely fall to remove
the most obstinate spot. The same so
lution is excellent to bleach crocheted
quilts, household. linen, curtains, etc.,
which have become yellow from being
packed away. When colored goods are
mildewed they can rarely be ..bleached,
as solutions which will remove a stain
will, also take out- the- color from; the
goods. Mildew on a - figured fabric
, having a* white 'ground . can j be suc
cessfully removed by moistening the
s'pot on the white ground only with the
solution, using a small brush. This is
best done by stretching the fabric on
an embroidery frame or hoop. As soon
as the spots fade out plunge the article
into a large quantity of water that Is
cold and thoroughly rinse out the lime
avoided. When enjoying a morning
dip wear a bathing suit with long
elceves and protect the face with a
wide brim hat; when the bath is over
do not linger long on the hot sand to
blister, but go to your bathhouse and
dress, applying a cooling cream to the
face, neck, arms and hands, to cor
rect exposure, and then dust liberally
with talcum powder. Carbolated vase-"

to sunburned skin and is also a pre

any drug store, Is delightfully cooling

line Is reached. iÂ«or all ordinary pur
poses, a pure face powder and a very
little rouge is all that is permissible
for a refined toilet. Get the very best
quality of liquid rouge and after wash
ing and drying the face, dampen the
cheeks and carefully rub on a deli
cate tint, blending It softly around the
edges and apply powder over the en
tire face. This will soften the rouge
so perfectly that it will be scarcely
discernible to even a critical observer.
Remove any powder which cljngs to
eyebrows or lashes with a soft brush
or handkerchief. Throw away the lip
rouge and eyebrow pencils; they are
unpardonable. If the lips are pale
massage them several times each day;
this will stimulate a more healthful
color. As your hair is quite .blonde
your eyebrows should correspond. To
color them black for the sake of effect
la merely ruining the pure blonde type.
FOR TRANSPARENT YOKES (Nel
lie). â To avoid spoiling the perfect out
line of the shee # r drop-yoke of summer
waists, make your corset cover without
shoulder-straps and also remodel the
knitted vests in this respect. The good
dresser is very particular that she does
not expose too many odd and end bits
ot lace through the openwork of her
waists. Thin lawn corset covers, which
5ho\v the vest, as ,well as parts of the
corset, are in extremely bad taste, and
the good appearance of Jhe outer gar
ment Is utterly ruined. The most
dainty practical corset cover is made
of English long cloth, which possesses
many advantages over lawn; its wear
ing qualities are above reproach, it is
opaque enough to conceal any article
worn beneath it, and yet Is. thin, soft
and cool. Cut the corset cover straight
at the top, well up under the arms and
finish the edge with a narrow, white
silk elastic to hold it up. As you are
stout around the hips finish the lower
edge of the cover at the waist line with
a strong lace beading run with a rib
bon for a belt and to adjust the extra
fullness. This obviates any useless
fullness and yet makes a perfect com
pletion. A cover of fine nainsook em
broidery in flounce width is also
charming. Face the front edges and
close with small pearl buttons and
loops- Of course the embroidered edge
forms the top, and the plain portion
may be dart-tucked or gathered at the
waist line into a belt of beading. Small
loops are made near the top edge in
which to run the elastic or ribbon: or,
.better still, select a pattern of em
broidery with holes of convenient size
and regularity, so that they may serve
the purpose.
A COMBINATION WINDOW
SEAT (Practical).â When cramped for
closet room .and at the* same time
economy must be enforced it would be
unwise to undertake a built-in window
seat for the purpose of providing a box
compartment. The wages of the car
penter and the cost of upholstery would
be ruinous for a really good article
built to order. Very useful box
couches can be purchased at moderate
cost and in a variety of lengths and
grades of covering, so that vou can
probably obtain a size which will near
ly fill the space. By the use of a few
gay pillows you will have a cozy, rest
ful nook and a roomy receptacle for
your gowns, hats, etc.. easy of access.
When one is forced to occupy a rather
small room its capacity of usefulness
may be greatly augmented by select
ing only such articles of furniture as
can be put to the greatest number of
uses. The much berated folding bed
turned, during the day, snugly against
the walJ exposes Its long mirrored
front, thus doing double dutv.

Then the question is just this â who
does put the shoulder to the wheel and
bear the brunt of everything? Some
one has to do it. In the ordinary house
hold there is a cook and a maid 6r
merely a maid of all work and they
are far too busy attending to their own
trials and tribulations to even give any
one else so much as a passing thought.
So it is quite evident they do not mend
the torn flounce, freshen up the after
noon frock with a scrap of new tulle or
see that the light gloves are clean and
presentable. They do not curl the
straight feather, cleanse the lace waist
or draw together the fine stocking. But
somebody does, for no matter whether
the household is big or little. Just such
tasks, and thankless ones they are, too,
bob up every day and manage to keep
one's nose pretty well to the grindstone.

to suppose for a single instant that

social pleasures she has allowed
her fund of practical wisdom, if

herself. i . *
Compare tile girl of to-day with, for
Instance, her grandmother. The latter
did not have the same broad education
and the same advantages that travel
brings, but she knew all that was nec
essary and more than enough to keep
all the men in the neighborhood guess
ing, and incidentally on pins and nee
dles. Besides all this she knew every
rule and regulation of housekeeping by
heart and could turn her hand from
bread making to millinery and
straighten out a frock in the meantime.
If a rush invitation found her -ward
robe inadequate she didn't fly about
like a spinning Jinny, looking for this,
that and the other thing. She bought
her material and primptly sat down
and fashioned it to suit her own sweet
fancy.
This girl of the CO's or thereabouts
â¢was not only independent, but emi
nently practical as well. By making
her own clothes she saved enough to
add any number of pretty nothings
that are so tantallzingly expensive and
at the same time she saved herself
the bother and annoyance' of running
about from dressmaker to dressmaker
only to be told that they "couldn't pos
bibly do it in such a short t^me."
How many girls in this age and gen
eration snap their fingers at the mil
liner or the dressmaker and go home
and turn out a frock or hat that may
be worn without its proclaiming from
the housetop that it is a home product?
Yet the girl of/ to-day has every fa
cility with which to work. She has an
endless variety of styles and fashions
from which to choosrr and for a trifle
may start forth to battle, armed with
a pattern that will fit her to a nicety.
Does she do it? Not very often. In
stead she buys a pretty Inexpensive
mull that costs her some three or four
dollars and takes it to her dressmaker
who charges her anywhere from twelve
to twenty dollars to make it and tacks
on a pretty bill for findings in the bar
gain. Such a girl isn't practical. Of
course, if she possesses a bulging pock
etbook. it does not matter one way or
the other, but if she keeps her eye on
her pennies to see that both ends meet,
6he is foolishly extravagant. Personal
ly I do not know of any easier way for
a girl to make money. And especially
the one who stops at home on an | al
lowance. It is not the. value of a
thing so much as the effect these days,
and if a twenty-five-cent gown can be

complete a dainty toilet. It's true the
going back and forth to the modiste to
be fitted is a decided nuisance, but then
it is one that cannot very well be
avoided and it's the sensible thing to
make the most and best of it. Visit
ing the hairdresser and waiting for a
manicure is another woe that is a nec
essary evil, but under the circum
stances it must be endured, for the
most must be made of oneself, and it
would be quite as bad to neglect one's
person as it would be to forget one's
manners.
THE practical girl is a Joy forever.
In fact, she is just about as re
freshing and surprising as a bit
of green in the midst of a desert
âand Just about as rare, too.
Perhaps the age should be blamed
more than the irirls, but whatever the
cause, the effect remains precisely the
came. Its frivolity and pleasure on all
tides and the fast and furious rate at
which the average girl whirls merrily

fashioned at home for nothing, certain
ly the cost of making is to the good,
and the exchequer contains just that
much more to expend on things of a
similar nature.
It is so with hats as well. Frames
are most inexpensive and if one has
any knack at all, a hat can be turned
out for three or four dollars, and the
selling price at any shop would be
some ten or twelve, or even more. But,
on the other hand, if one does not
possess that happy faculty of trimming
and twisting, headgear is a mighty
good thing to let strictly alone. A
frock may be ever so dainty and pret
ty, but if the hat is not becoming or
fetching, it ruins the entire effect, and
in such cases the home product is not
only a dismal failure, but a poor in
vestment, as welL
Any practical girl can pave many a
penny if she wills it. All the little frills
and furbelows that are so dear to her
heart cost a small fortune to keep in
repair and neat and freshâ that is, un
less she attends to it herself. Rib
bons soil so quickly and they clean so
easily, if one but has the patience to
work over them properly. And so it
is with gloves, and in fact, all the
gee-gaws that are dainty and so dis
tressingly perishable. In many cases
but a few stitches are needed here and
there, but unless they are taken in a
cunning fashion they have a decidedly
uncomfortable way of making them
selves known to the world in general,
and always at the most unfortunate^
time.
Nearly every lassie has learned the
art of embroidering, and she does it oc
casionallyâjust when she feels so in

J"%tDER HAGGARD, the romancer
AÂ£ of romancers, has outdone him
self In his last story, "The.
Brethren." All that made the
early success, "She," breathless, all
that made the later story, ."The Pearl
Maiden," dramatic finds place in the
scheme "- of this 'â¢ romance. This and
something more, a finer touch of the
literary essence of restraint than that
shown in any of his previous works.
The man who wrote "King; Solo
mon's Mines" and "Allan Quarter
main" over a decade ago has strug
gled through a long period of emanci
pation from the shackles of sensation
alism and at last- found his place as
a master at legitimate romance. The
Rider Haggard of to-day is not the
Rider Haggard of the eighties/whose
books were forbidden children of ner
vous temperament, but eagerly read
by the elders in the seclusion of their
closets. While not curbing his Imag
ination a whit, the popular author
has succeeded . In diverting . It into
channels more subdued than. those
along which "Eric Brlghteycs" and
"Maiwa's Revenge" plunged their mad
course. The staid muse of literature
may award Flaubert's "Salammbo" the
palm for imaginative 'romance while
withholding a like honor from "King
Solomon's, Mines." This* measure of
distinction Haggard has recognized In
his later books, in none more than the
one now under consideration.
The' Crusades, that inspiration of
romance itself, offers Haggard the
field for "The Brethren." His story
opens in feudal England at a castle
on the Essex coast, the stronghold of,
the D'Arcys. There lives. Rosamund,
the daughter of old Sir Andrew
D'Arcy, a girl born of the romantic
marriage between the English knight

Jjfm yÂ° un S writer with one book al
'' fX ready tallied after his name,
has attempted to enroll himself In the
Howells school of fiction with a long
and serious novel, "Zelda Dameron."
The attempt has not been altogether
successful, for the author has not made
himself master of the Howells art of
finding significance in" the common
place. He mistakes all Incident* for
telling Incident. He believes that the
trimming of a pie crust deserves equal
emphasis with a daughter's branding
her father as a liar. As a consequence,
though Mr. Nicholson .has -evolved a
plot of considerable strength and
shown, a good insight Into human
character, he has filled his book with
a lot of useless lumber that clogs ac

Edward White's book "The Moun

The author of "The Blazed Trail" and
"Conjuror's House," himself a man of
the East, has but recently learned what
joy lies In California's mountains. Now
he lives at Santa Barbara, within close
touch of the coast mountains, and', as
this book demonstrates, not too far
from the Sierra -to" be beyond striking
distance. Only this summer, gossip
has It, Mr. 'White roughed it in the
most Inaccessible ranges, the "tender
foot" in that Instance being his bride.
Knowing the spell of the mountains,
then, and sensing all of the Indefinable
emotions born of their near presence,
the author has written "The Moun
tains" to carry to others some of the
charm denied them by circumstance or,
maybe, very lack of energy. Familiar
ity with "The Forest," White's descrip
tion of the timbered region of the Ca
nadian lake country, will prepare read
ers to enjoy in this book the writer's
rare gift of word painting. He both
reproduces the natural picture and con
serves in his reproduction the essence
of things felt, not seen. Not^only does
he spread before us the panorama of
peak and canyon, but he makes to live
again for those who have once felt It
that intangible, compelling power which
we call the spirit of the mountains.
By contrast the piece that stands out
strongest in all of White's descriptions
of wild places is his chapter on "The
Inferno." Death Valley and the south
ern desert have both been done before
in fiction and In works of travel, never
better, however, than In the strong, sub
jective'manner of this writer's treat

expect such to weigh greatly In tha

The major part of Kakuzo's work' Is
devoted to a , study of the historical
growth of the country, of its emanci
pation from what he terms "the night,
of Asia," of its gradual fermentation
under isolation and Its final yielding to
the pressure from within at the touch
of the civilization of the West. As no
one h,as yet succeeded in analyzing so
clearly, the writer follows the lndissol- Â¦"
uble growth of the religious and secu
lar spirit in the life of the people. Indi
cating how from earliest time the soul
of -Japan was made one with those of
India and of China through the bonds
of Confucianism and Buddhism. The
result of the highly specialized philo
sophic doctrines of the Japanese mid
dle ages, which held sway until the
country emerged Into the light, of the
last decade, the author summarizes
thus;.
"The national consciousness, divided
within Itself by the dams and dikes of
Its own conventions, could but narrow
and finally stagnate. The flow of spon
taneity ceased with the end of the sev
enteenth century. The microscopic ten
dency of later Oriental thought be
came In us accentuated to a degree un
known even in China. Our life grew to
be like that of our miniature and dwarf
trees."
From this state of enforced quiesc
ence, which was due to the influence
of religious thought and which even to
day holds sway over China, Japan
freed herself, according to this author
ity, as a result of a ferment within.
.Three national schools of thought arose
almost simultaneously in the early
years < of the eighteenth century, em
bodying the spirit of -protest against
the elaborate formalism and the dead
ening introspection of philosophic dic
tum. Harking back to the purer and
earlier' systems of \ religious thought,
these- schools revived the slumbering

air. Kakuzo will give his Occidental
readers ample food for reflection by his
exposition of .the attitude of new Japan
and Aala generally toward the Western
world. "To most Eastern nations the
advent of the West has been by no
means . an unmixed blessing," says he.
Against our imagined "yellow peril"
Japan and the rest of the Orient has a

Sir Andrew " lives, under . the haunting

In the early chapters of the story
D'Axcy's worst fears are realized.
First by bold attack and then by a
ruse the retainers of the eastern po
tentate attempt to kidnap Rosamund.
The second effort brings success. Sir
Andrew killed and the^brethren Wulf
and Godwin stupefied by drugged
wine, Saladin's agents hurry their fair
prize on to a galley and hale her off
to be presented to the court of her
powerful uncle. There follows a whirl
wind of incident and adventure- The
brethren hasten to Syria on the mad
quest of rescue. Treachery brings
Rosamund to the court of Al-Je-bal, -a
terrible ruler over assassins, whose
stronghold is in the fastnesses of the
mountains of Lebanon. Fate draws
her rescuers there also. A web of con
spiracy and murderlngs, a sudden
veer from death", escape for all three
and at last unexpected clemency from
Sala'in, the plot carries through a
dramatic fight upon the narrow bridge
at Masyaf, the headlong flight from
the country, of ' the dreaded Al-Je-bal
and at last the terrible battle on the
Hill of Hattin, where the last vestige
of Christian power in Palestine was
swept away. Through the whole tale
is upheld the abiding love between
the twin brother? Wulf and Godwin,
beneath this the tangle or the love of
both of them for the fair Rosamund.
If only Rider Haggard could match
his style with his Imagination he would
easily rank with Maurice Hewlltt as
first among romance writers. Unfor

One who allows himself to say, "Has

his own worst opponent in the bid for
recognition as a careful writer.

quote the author's phraseâ she re
turns to victorious Japan at the close

Hana weds the now thoroughly dys

mid clouds of painted maple leaves.
Ingenuous is the word that fits the
characterization of this quaint Jap
anese novel. Gensai Mural has read
Just enough of "Ouida," Archibald
Clavering Gunter, and Marie Corelli,
possibly, to believe himself possessed
of the true Occidental . story telling
idea; with this as foundation he has
built up a' tale of Japanese flavor
which is neither strictly Occidental nor
strictly Japanese. 'Eurasian is this
chiK i of. Eastern ' ingenuity .and
Western idea. Its characteristics
are not those . of heredity, but
those due to the acquisi
tiveness of â¢ one of the parents. A
study of the novel Is a delight as well
as a benefit to the English reader, for
it shows the fiction idea of the West
as interpreted according to Japanese
lights. By it we may see Just how
much weight our conventions and
traditions of fiction bear with a
writer schooled to totally different
standards.
Seven authenticated and one legend

in this volume. Some are well known
to all students of literature, some fall
under the eye of the antiquary only.
Of the first kind are the stories of
Dante and Beatrice and of Abelard and
Helolse, classics both of them in tha
annals of letters. These two well
known episodes of tragic love offer tho
writer little ground for new treatment,
and he is content with telling again tho
ead Incidents* that have passed down
into history. In touching upon tho lovo
of the Elizabethan gallant. Sir Philip
Sidney, for Lady Devereux, Le Galli
enne freshens a romantic tale of trua
love, which lives in the quaint old lova
Journal, "Astrophel and Stella," Sid
ney's longest poem. The affection oÂ£
Heine for Mathilde and the passion be
tween Lassalle and Helene von Don
nigea, herein retold by Le Gallienne,
are both new tales to most of us.

vocated the general practice of their
own failing the apologist says: "Of all

not vouchsafe an explanation of the ac
tual working operation of this scheme.

TRULY if it Is a poet who can opell

Richard Le Gallienne is that one. "Old
Love Stories Retold" is his chronicle
of blighted affections.
Le Gallienne is peculiarly fitted above
all his fellows to read poetry out oC
the prosiest facts. His sensitiveness
to the impress of esthetic emotion ha3
at time3 been commented upon as
something beyond the normal; affected,

Granting that this is only supersensi

that if any one can find romance un

Dameron was a real generous girl. Mr.
Howells Is competent to handle such

But as to the plot conveyance for
these accumulated sentiments â that is
a queer grafted product of good old
Occidental melodrama on a Japanese
root stock. The opening chapter of the
*tory discloses an unfortunte young
gentlema: from Chicagoâ a Mr. Con
ner, seeking health at the springs of
Mlyanoshlta. His malady Is not a
broken heart, not nostalgia even, but
dyspepsia! Blunt realism this. At the
watering place he falls In with a patri
archal Japanese doctor and his charm
ing daughter, Hana. The villain also
enters upon the scene of action â Mr.
Dantld, a Russian naval officer. The
food doctor undertakes to cure Mr.
Connor i of . his ailment and the bad
Russian undertakes simultaneously a
degÂ» of the fair maiden's heart. But
wax's alarms Interrupt the progress of
botti operations. Mr. Danskl hurries
to Join his fleet at Port Arthur and
Hana's household Is plunged Into gloom
at tfce departure of the only son for the
â¢ocao of activities.
We are spectators next of the thrill-
Ing torpedo boat attack upon the Port
Arthur squadron. In the midst of the
exultant Banzals of the victorious Jap
anese Bailors Eounds ' this reproof,
strangely reminiscent of the admonition
that made an American chip captain
femoua In the engagement at Santiago.
"Boys, don't chter, men are dying!"
Despite this, however, tho Russian
Danskl comes near dying under the
sword of Hana's valiant brother, but
he Is snatched from death and sent to
Sascbo Hospital In Japan, where for
tuitously, Hana, the beautiful, serves as
a Red Cross nurse. The plot thickens.
Hana feels It to be her duty to Japan
to worm out of Danskl all the military
eecrets of Port Arthur. The villain con
sents to give them only on promise of
marriage. After much mental travail
Hana asrrees. The villain tells all ho
knows and Hana la sacrificed to a
pledge inviolable for the honor and
.glory of the Mikado.
Meanwhile the dyspeptic Mr. Con
ner, through love of the beautiful Jap
anese girl, has passed through hlde
o*us adventures among the Russians in 1
vain attempt to save her from self
appointed martyrdom. He comes to
Easebo Hospital grievously wounded
and falls ynder the care of the fair
one. Thus he importunes her for the
cause of her manifest grief:
"Miss Hana, if you have an Inch of
sorrow In your heart. It will reflect
â¢upon mine a foot of grief. You will
excuse me for telling it. -Miss Hana,
but you have the whole of my sym
pathy. Why can you not tell me the
cause of your affliction?"
"I have no' objection to telling you,"
replies Hana, "but I fear It will only
burden your heart when you hear it,
Mr. Conner. I cannot bear to give
you trouble and pain on account of
me."
Here Is the romance of courtship
a la Japonais.
Bu{ -to make a' long "story short,
Hana. cannot entertain the proffered
love of Mr. Conner because she feels
"Because one fruit that has been
snatched from a tree may taste sour
do not disdain the whole of the tree;
time will ripen the rest of the fruit."
A "purpose novel," categorically reck
oned, is this, therefore. Indeed a read
ing of the first chapter alone would
convince of this â¢ even had we not the
author's prefaced word for It. Purpose
looms large from' every page. "Uncle
Tom's Cabin" in ante-bellum days had
;no^ more didactic force than "Hana, a
Dan'grhter of Japan." TJussia' is beyond
the pale of ..righteous- consideration;
Japan is everlastingly right. Russia is
the-aggrandizer, the ruthless oppressor;
Japan is the fighter for liberty. The
Muscovite represents the decadence of
the human type; the Japanese stands
in the ; foreground of enlightenment.
Ossa piled on Pellon could not o'ertop
the high heaped argument of Mr. Gen
sal Mural.
Mr. Ur.kichi Kawai. the gentleman
who has given the admirable transla
tion of Mural's story, besides telling
the Occidental reader all he knows
about the author, his life and works,
devotes a paragraph to the story tell
er's purpose in having "Hana" thus
opened to Western reading. In the
midst of his manifold and pressing la
bors as editor in chief of the Hochi-
Shlmbun, a Tokio newspaper, Gensai
Mural wrote this novel for the sole
purpose of revealing to the world the
spirit Japan is showing in the present
conflict and the fundamentals of her
people's ethical and social life, which
makes such a brave stand possible. To
this exposition of the inspiration direct
ing his pen the author himself adds a
thought in a commendably brief pre
face. He declares that deeming it his
duty as a writer to add his talent to
the grand treasury of nafional defense
he wrote "Hana" -for the purposes of
translation, so that the world outside
of Japan might see and understand.
Furthermore, this novel he sends as the
herald of many to be given to the.Eng
lish tongue. Then this naive admoni
tion:

LONDON,; Nov. 26.â At last London
has. been treated ; to a genuine novelty
as an accompaniment of a fashionable
.wedding. Several attempts 'to depart
from .the beaten '. traac of . matrimonial
celebrations have been made among the
smart set Â¦ this season, but they have
had little to recommend them. Some
brides, eager to anticipate their millin
ery trlumphs.have worn thelr.trouaseau
gowns at. special functions before the
day of the wedding; others have gone
so far. as to hold. their wedding recep
tions before they were married. But
heretofore none has .ventured to defy
the hpary custom which prescribes that"
honeymoon trips shall be reserved for
the exclusive and selfish enjoyment of
bride and bridegroom alone. Now, how
ever^ one couple has done it. As a re
sult there is to be recorded a honey
moon in which the happy pair is ac
companied throughout its journey by
the bridesmaids and young men friends
chaperoned ; by the bride's mother. It
is ; the honeymoon ,up to date. Many
similar ones are sure- to follow.
But the woman who Is doing most for
the egg-producing industry of Great
Britain is the Marchioness of Salisbury
wife of the present Marquis, and daugh
ter-In-law of the late Premier. She
ha? grasped the fact that foreign com
petition cannot be combated merely by
increasing the number of British egg
laying hens. Facilities" must also be
provided for selecting the eggs : and
getting them to market. With this dou
ble object in view she has founded the
National Poultry Organization Society,
on lines which promise to make it the
most thorough-going of British trusts.
Ehe has persuaded to Join her in this
strange enterprise three Â¦ Dukes, four
Earls, half a dozen lesser lords and a
LEADER IN THE WORK,
en the farm, while the Queen holds un
dirputed sway over the poultry yard â
an eminently practical arrangement
which prevents the royal tempers being
ruffled by differences of opinion.
The American Countess of Craven
carries off <;uite as many prizes as the
Queen at poultry shows and exhibits all
over the country. In addition she does
her best to encourage the I rearing of
fowls among the people In her neigh
borhood by holding an annual poultry
show at her residence, Coombe Valley,
near Coventry, in Warwickshire.
Another titled American matron. Vis
countess Deerhuret, Is a keen poultry
fancier, who does not devote her atten
tion exclusively to the breeding of prize
winners. One of the objects of her
poultry farm is to demonstrate that it
is quite possible to make money out of
eggs and chickens in England. Her
husband. Viscount Deerhurst, is the
president of the Poultry Club. Among
other distinguished patrons of the hum
ble hen are Lady Calthorpe, the Coun
tess of Home, Lady Tichborne, Lady
Wilson. Lady Frederick Fitzroy, the
Duchess of Sutherland, Lady Amherst.
Lady Muriel Digby and Lady Alger
non Gordon-Lennox.

But as it is essential to the popular
â¢tation of the British hen that she
hould prove a paying investment, the
lueen does not di'-'-in to sell her sur
plus eggs and chickens. The proceeds
therefrom and the prize money she wins

LONDON*. Nov. 26.â Within the last
twenty years England has paid foreign
countries 5375,000,000 for eggs, consider
ably over 51S.000.000 annually. Experts
are agreed that there is no good reason
why the greater portion of this money
should not find its way into the pockets
of British poultry keepers. It is not
the fault of the British hen. Given a
lair show the will do her duty as well
as did MacduSf and "lay on" until na
ture puts an end to her productiveness.
The fault lies with those who have neg
lected her ai;d the means of getting her
eggs to market. , .
In this state of affairs certain aristo
cratic dames have undertaken the re
generation, multiplication and popular
ization of the domestic fowl in Great
Britain. It is really a work of national
importance and even royalty does not
content itself with merely bestowing
its distinguished patronage on the pa
triotic project.
At Sandrinjrham. where Edward VII
has demonstrated that if accident had
not made him a King, he might still
have attained seme fame as a first-class
farmer, the Queen runs a modest poul
try establishment. ThÂ«re she has a lot
of utilitarian fowls without any super
fluous frills on them, which attend
strictly to the egg-laying business. But
for show purposes she keeps several
fancy breeds, including the "silkie," a
r.ame derived from this fowl's plumage,
which is as soft a? silk. The Queen
makes also a specialty of bantams and
has some of the smallest birds of that
class in England. She wins many prizes
at poultry shows and purely on the
merits of her exhibits, for no favors
are shown royalty in such competitions.
SOME TITLED FANCIERS.
The society has already opened fif
teen egg depots, all of which are doing
a brisk business. The Marchioness- of
Salisbury and the other great folk who
are furnishing the means for the reju
venation of the egg business in Great
Britain make no money cut of it- In
the beginning every farmer receives for
his eggs the ruling local price, what
ever it may be. Here the society does
She aims to accomplish in Great Brit
ain what has already beÂ£n done in Den
mark. In that country during the last
twenty years 350 co-operative societies
have been formed with a membership
of over 20,000, which have established
egg depots all through the country dis
tricts. To these the farmers send the
eggs, . and there^ they are packed and
sh'pped so promptly that Danish eggs
are on sale in London shops four days
after they leave the nests. Tlie result
is worth the trouble it has taken, for
while in 1871 the imports of Danish eggs
in Great Britain amounted to only $150,
0<X>, last year they exceeded in value

EXAMPLE FROM DENMARK.
Bishop or two, while a Princess, a
Duchess and a lot of other noble folk
are on the .executive committee. But
it Is the Marchioness herself who vir
tually runs the association.
Unlike most persons of quality who
accept'the office of president, she is not
content with the role of an amiable
figurehead, but makes a point of at
tending every meeting of the poultry
organization at its stuffy little offices
in fashionable Hanover Square, of pay
ing regular visits to the depots which
the organization has established
throughout the country and generally
doing a lot of hard work in connection
with the project. The present Marquis
of Salisbury will never fill the place of
his father as a statesman, but the
Marchioness feels that if she can suc
ceed In substituting the British egg for
the foreign egg she will have done
something to perpetuate the fame of
the Cecils. For it will mean putting
Jl?,000000 a year into British pockets
that now goes into foreign pockets.

Grand President Caminetti, accom
panied by Past Grand Presidents Corf
rad, Tillman and Keith and Grand Sec
retary Frakes, paid an official visit on
the third Saturday in November to La
Estrella Parlor. There was an exem
plification of the work, which was well
presented, and of the business meth
ods, that were complimented, after
which there was a long talk by the
grand president and the answering of a
number of questions relative to the or
der, after which the other visitors ad
dressed the meeting. The parlor pre
sented Mrs. Caminetti a fine crystal
berry dish.
Past Grand President Belle W. Con
rad, who was accompanied by her

City of Mexico.
When Grand President Caminetti was
on an official visit In Humboldt County
recently she had to go from Eureka to
Arcata by coach. By reason of the po
sition she occupies she was given the
seatTby the driver. As the coach was
about to start she noticed that a mule
was about to be tied on behind
in order to lead it to its destination,
and having some knowledge of mules,
their stubbornness and the danger of
narrow places an country roads, she
entered a protest against tying the
mule to the coach, on the ground that if
the mule got balky on a narrow part of
the road he might pull to one side and
turn the coach over. The driver polite
ly told the lady that he must take the
mule to its destination, and the grand
president said she must go to Arcata
to keep an engagement with the parlor
there, but she would not ride If the
mule was tied to the coach. After some
parley a compromise was struck. The
grand president said that If an extra
halter were put on she would hold the
v free end, lead the animal and if he
balked she could let go the rope /and
there \vould not be any danger, adding
at the time that she understood all
about leading mules. When the des
tination was in sight the grand presi
dent remarked that that mule was the
most docile animal she had ever led,
and she alighted in Arcata to discover
that during the entire trip she had been
holding the free end of a halter, the
other end of which had not been on the
mule, but had been- tied to the boot of
the coach. The grand president took
the joke played on her good-naturedly,
and since . then has been telling the
story in the parlors, trying to make the
sisters believe that the joke was on the
grand secretary. The latter has filed a
protest.
Golden Bar Parlor of Sierra Citv was
about to surrender its charter, but the
official visit of Gra"nd President Camin
etti a short time ago changed the
aspect of things. Since that visit the
parlor has initiated seventeen candi
dates, and It is again what it was until
the spirit of depression made ': itself
manifest. Mrs- Carrie Cook and Mrs.
Sinnott," who have always stood by the
parlor in adversity as well as in pros
perity, were greatly encouraged the
advice of the grand president, and with
renewed energies j did much to bring
about tbe result which has been noted.

the Golden West on the third Wednes
day in November was visited by a dele

spiration from the manner in which

treated with that liberal hospitality for
which this parlor is noted. The occa
sion of the visit was to present to the
parlor a set of beautifully engrossed
and framed resolutions of thanks to the
parlor's drum corps for the service it
rendered during the celebration in LJv
ermore on the Fourth of July. The
resolutions were accepted on behalf of
Olympus by General Organizer Andrew
Mocker, one of its most active mem
bers.

ECHOES FROM THE LODGE ROOMACTRESS STARRING IN A NEW FITCH PLAY.
"Candida" as Louise Prosser created.it.
The mixture of deference and fa
miliarity, naivete and shrewdness, sur
face refinement and vulgarity, is most
aptly suggested. One gets out of the
portrait In fact much that Mr. Fitch
Intends, to Its delicate flattery to one's
superior knowledge as -to the relative
merits of Mr. Homer's "Iliad" and "Mr.
Emphatically, however, the character
Is played in an admirably right key.
The make-up is as good as Prossy's in
is for itself alone, that it has not the
slightest bearing on the plot, that it is
aggressively over-accented, may all be
charged Justly against it- Miss
Georgie Lawrence's fashion of playing
the part rather conduces to its effect of
aggression. Mr. Fitch has given Miss
Shindle more good lines than any oth
er character in .the piece. Very con
scious Miss Lawrence is of her respon
sibility In delivering them. So fearful
is she that a word may be lost that
she fires most of them point blank at
the audience. She digs it In the ribs
with them as De Pachmann does with a
Chopin phrase. She waves them about
like a red flag at a crossing. None of
Mr. Fitch's points are going to be
missed if Miss Lawrence knows it!
"Her Own Way." besides the happy
Miss Shindle, holds also another char
acter of unusual strength, that of the
successful speculator, Sam Coast.
There is an almost Pinero-Iike swift
ness and sureness of stroke in its draw
ing. Coast wants to marry Georgiana,
who wants to marry the other man.
With the cool head and unscrupulous
eye that have won him his millions on
"the street," Coast plans the ruin of
Gtorgiana's' family. This, he con
ceives from his knowledge of women,
will drive this one into a marriage
with him. Georgiana Is the other kind,
however, and Coast fails. But Fitch
has painted him well, to the last word
of the characteristic dialogue. One
cannot but admire his logical brutality,
the force of the bad, strong man, that
takes where he will, because he will.
Even Coast's last-act repentance, at
first sight Implausible, falls later into
line. But the figure, robustly substan
tial, albeit somewhat ambiguously sug
gested by James Carew, comes incred
ibly in the conventional atmosphere of
Meredith's "Lucille"; but we should get
more, and Miss Lawrence is quite the
person to give it. If she gave less.
"Why, miss." she protested, with a
distinct drag at my own locks, "Miss
Elliott won't have a hair left with that
creature combing' her that way. It's all
very \rell to have feelingrs, but you
shouldn't let them interfere with busi
ness. A born hairdresser don't do that.
How long do you . think I'd hold my
ladles if I did that way? And fancy
Miss Elliott doing up her own hair!
Who ever heard of such a thins?
The man that made that play ought
to be told that he don't know beans â
beggicg your pardon, miss."
In the sacred privacy of these col
umns. I however dare to differ. Beans,
Mr. Fitch may not know, but his Bel
la Shindle shows a virtuoso acquaint
ance with the "capillarist," as H. G.
Wells calls to-morrow's tonsorial artist.
The figure stands out with liveliest
realism, the sly parallel of its below
stairs vulgarity with the coarseness of
the drawirg-room one of the delights
of the play. That the figure is lugged
My hairdresser is in despair. She
came to me the other day with war In
her eye and blood on her lip. Clyde
Fitch is the innocent cause. The dra
matist has, it seems, cruelly libeled her
art in "Her Own Way."

ed therefrom. Willard Slmms will have

cast promised throughout is excellent.
Irene Outtrim, a new contralto, makes
her American debut in the opera; Edith
Mason, always welcome, returns, and
Dora de Fillippe, Teddy Webb and the
rest will all be there. As Henry Sav
age produced the piece here it was one
of the most attractive of Its metal, and
it is expected that the Tivoli produc
tion will rival their standard one of
"The Toreador."
"Her Own Way" will, just for to
night, give way to German comedy at
the Columbia, when "Grossstadtluft"
will be given. The performance by the
Alameda Lustspiel Ensemble is arous
ing considerable interest among the
German section of the community.

Mme. Slapoffsld, a discovery of the
Orpheum, to which she came by way of
Australia, is creating In the Eastern
vaudeville houses the same sensation
that she created here with her power
ful voice and clever singing.
A new "Jubilate" will be part of the
service at Grace Methodist Church this
morning. It is by Fletcher Husband,
organist at the Central Methodist
Church, and, interestingly, will be
played by Robert Husband, father of
the young man, who Is the Grace
Church organist. I hear good things
of it.
Alfred A. Farfand, the banjoist, to
one of whose concerts I was once inTit
ed by an admirer of his to "give the
ears I gave Paderewskl," win give me
another chance next week but one. Mr.
Farland gives a recital at Steinway
Hall on Tuesday evening. December
13, and is said to do really extraordi
nary things with the banjo.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The Orpheum offers the musical nov
elty of the week in the engagement of
Marguerite Le Roy, late prima donna
soprano of the famous French Opera
Company of New Orleans. The stager
will be heard here for the first time to
day and is said to be distinctly worth
hearing. Mme. Le Roy brings -with her
Signor G. Ricci, whose violin playing
Is enthusiastically heralded. The sing
er's programme will include some of
the operatic arias in which she has ap
peared.
Rejane In French repertoire Is the
latest sensation of the Nek York thea
ters. While generally deprecating the
character of her plays the New York
press has only praise for the art of the
actress. "Amoureuse," "Lolotte" and
"La Parserelle" were the bills of her
first week. L -Â¦*;<<
In the coming production of "A
Chinese Honeymoon" John L. Kearny
"Little Johnny Jones," in which
George M. Cohan Is starring after per
petrating, was first presented last
week in New -York. Mr. Cohan, it is
said, has been unkind to himself In the
"musical play" as he calls it, but has
furnished other folk in the cast with
"fat" parts. Ethel Levey. Jerry J. Co
han, Helen M. Cohan and Truly Shat
tuck are among the other fun-makers.
"Xot since 'Arizona* was produced
here the first time has the plaintive
mystery, the dry humor and the weird
romanticism which are a part of the
comedy and tragedy of wild prairie
life been depicted so delightfully and
so graphically to the playgoers of
Washington as was the case at the
Columbia Theater last night, when
"The Virginian' was given its Initial
performance in the capital city. The
piece embodies the principal Incidents
in Owen Wister*s novel of the same
name,' and in dramatic form it im
pressively conveys to the audience the
atmosphere of that Western border
land, where a high sense of natural
Justice was wont to reign untrammel
ed in the absence of law and where
retribution was meted out with swift
ness and dispatch to the desecrators
of the rights of other men. One in
full sympathy with the spirit of the
play is conscious of the strange fas
cination of the plains, of the strong
virulent life, of the thrilling spirit of
adventure and the bonds of good fel
lowship, which actuated the pioneers
of the prairies in their struggles to
ward the upbuilding of the new coun
try. tg#&
"Mr. Dustin Farnum, In the title
role, has made the Virginian stand out
with striking force as a strange char
acter study. His characteristic com
posure, coolness and reserve are in
strong contrast with the adventurous
action In which he participates. In all
his work he is deliberate and convinc
ing, and bears himself with that cer
tain confidence of a man who knows
what it is to depend on himself for
whatever of success he may achieve
in any purpose. It Is to be expected
that duty stands first with him, even
above his loyalty to friends and his
love. His impersonation of the role
is both artistic and strong.
"Another strong character in the piece
is that of Trampas, who is depicted
with great skill by Frank Campeau as
a type of the reckless and lawless cat
tle rustler of the ranges, daring and
desperate rather than courageous- Miss
Helen Holmes, who portrayed the
schoolma'arn. was charmingly natural
and winsome, and proved Interesting as
the heroine, and Guy Gates Post, as
Steve, merited more than ordinary fa
vor In his impersonation of a compar
atively small part. Frank Monroe.
Frank Nelson and Charles Mailes did
seme particularly clever work as the
cowboy friends of the Virginian. The
scenic embellishments of the produc
tion were notably In harmony with
the atmosphere of the piece."

that Its effect was nobly religious.
Hardly that,, ho*.vever, is the first
scene between Coll, Mak, Daw and
Gyv, but their later scene of the of
fering of gifts to the Infant Jesus so
becomes, and one gratefully accepts
the first for its naive human and his
toric interest. The Herod scene â He
rod was the favorite villain of the
miracle playâ will be found also most
interesting, though it is to be hoped
that the dragon has been lost In .the
Berkeley wilds. Mr. Crawley's Herod
Is a truly remarkable performance.
Here, too, is where Proressor Gayley
has done what of original work is to
be found in his fascinating compila
tion. The nativity scene of course
crowns the play, and none can refuse
to it a momentary thrill. Altogether
the play will be found as interesting
as it is seasonable.
To me, after this, the uncouth come
dy of the shepherds came neither ir
reverently nor irrelevantly. It had for
me something of the "feel" of an eld
Flemish picture of Christ blessing the
little children that 1 1 once saw. Pa
thetically Flamande was the Christ fig
ure. The children, close capped and
straitly gowned, were probably the
painter's. The surrounding men and
women were stolid \ Flemish burghers
and their mates, the mise en scene
most frankly of the time. The artist
had, in fact, brought the Christ famil
iarly into his day. Yet. the picture
was Instinct with such fine simplicity
of reverence, such inherent dignity.
For the litterateur the play has pecu
liar attraction in its rugged and-naive
ly beautiful verse. For the theolo
gian it is again peculiarly suggestive.
Those interested in dramatic history
can, of course, not afford to miss it.
And to the artist the play affords
pictures which his experience will be
eminently the poorer for; lacking: But
he that takes with him the eyes' that
widened over the exalted romance of
the Magi, that followed in the Bible
pictures the splendid wanderings of the
Eastern .Princes toward the star, will
get most from "The Star of Bethle
hem." In fact, the point of view rather
imposes itself. The curtain opens upon
a picture that pitches the key rev
erent Immediately. It is that of Con
stance Crawley as Angel Gabriel, a fig
ure nothing short of celestial in its
white and wonderful blue draperies.
Annunciation lilies in the hand, the

Merrily joes the whirligig of pleas

their wonted gladness, loves have been
plighted, cards played with a fervor
worthy of nobler cause, 'teas given
with their usual inane chatter, gossip
been bantered about at luncheons and
dinners have filled the spirit with joy
â 6ome of them, â and the body with
woe. Of the week's doings herewith
are a few leading affairs:
MONDAY.
Not a whit less beautiful is the work
done by the women of the Needlework
Guild, who on Friday gathered at
Miss West's School and arranged for
the distribution of thousands â think
uf it â thousands of new winter garments
for the needy. Now, here is a phase
of philanthropy that appeals to the
higher instincts of the heavy laden.
New garments only are accepted and
distributed â none of your last year's
ball gowns and soiled satin slippers â
but needed garments for needy peo
ple, and in this let the good women
be encouraged. That new clothes
have a moral effect upon the mind no
Kane person denies. And as the mind,
so is rhe life. Hence the logic â the
sanity â of this "new clothes" idea.
Long may it live and prosper.
To the president of the local guild,
Mrs. William A. Lange, is unlimited
honor due. With clever manipulation
she has carried the work to its pres
ent large proportions, which bears
the splendid individuality of non-sec
tarianism and breadth of Christian
spirit. Then, here's to our Lady
Bountiful. May she ever be happy â
a sharer in the happiness she gives!
And so it is with the maids and ma
trons of kindly leisure, who, through
the mist of teas and bridge and formal
â¢â¢etunts," have found the way â yea,
and the sweet inclination, most of
them â to bring to their poorer breth
ren such Joys as come only through
mystic hands. There is in the holiday
season a psychological quality. All Is
not gayety and self-interest for them
who know not the sting of want. There
are other griefs that are not to be ex
punged by the rattle of gold. And it
is at the holiday time that men and
women, sated with gold-bought things,
turn to the heavy-laden for Joys they
may bring to them â and in that Joy
warm their souls In the glow that
leaps into life at the bringing of com
forts to desolate hearts. It is at this
time that the women of San Francisco
are busy â and thrice busyâ doing
good.
On Tuesday eight the Woman's Ex
change, the splendid medium where
by women may help themselves, was
generously aided by the fine loyalty of
sexne hundreds of smart men and
women. And blessings on them for it!

The environs of. Bakersfleld hold
many attractive country places and
ranches, among them the one owned
by General Shafter, another' that of
William Tevis. Mr. Tevis with his
family has just left in his private car
for the out-of-town home tospend the
holidays. General Shafter and the
McKittricks will be gone all winter.
Still another emigrant to Bakersfield
is Mrs. Truxtun Beale, who will stay
until spring, but no distance, clime nor
locality can separate her from her de
voted cousin, Miss Marie. Wells, who
will shortly join Mrs. Beale. The
friends of Miss Wells begrudge her ab
sence, for there is a time coming soon
when she will be carried far, away for
many moons. Even though that trip
will be a honeymoon", surrounded by
every Ideal of luxury, those left behind
are loth to see her depart.
Oregon weather, notorious, literally
put a damper on Colonel Wain-Mor
gan's plans for hunting. While secur
ing much game of smaller variety, the
result was not quite satisfactory. Well,
we are blessed on weather conditions,
and there is only one California.
At the Sequoia Club on Tuesday
night one of the most fascinating wom
en in the rooms was Mrs. G. A. Boyer.
Black of hair, dark of eye and fair of
skin, she was a fine foil to the dainty
beauty of Miss Marie Wells, whose
guest she was.
Cleverness has come to- be a requisite
for success in society as in the saner
world. Time was when beauty and
youth carried, but not to-day. There
must be an underlying basis for suc
cessâa mind quality. The clubs are
subserving a good purpose in demon
strating feminine cleverness, and to the
Century, the Browning, the Sorosis and
other cultured clubs is due the credit
of bringing to the fore the cleverness
of Mrs. Newton J. Tharp as a reader.
True, Mrs. Tharp has enjoyed the
training afforded in the best schools of
oratory in the country, but it is only
within the last year or two .that this
interesting little woman is showing
what she can do, and to the foremen
tloned clubs is the honor due for dis
covering her.

Laws are made for the greatest good

"The placing of game among the
articles of commerce is in fact offering
a premium for its annihilation. So
long as there is a market for it it will
be killed in the greatest possible num
bers. It will be killed at all times and
under all circumstances. Neither the
man who shoots it for the market nor
the man who sells it does or will pay
any attention to the laws limiting the
number to be killed or sold. This is
not only the condition in this State,
but it has been the same in every
State until it was taken out of the
markets altogether. The experience
of other States has been that the only
way to preserve the game supply is to
take it out of the markets altogether,
thereby removing- the reward for its
destruction. They have tried all other
schemes and all have proved failures
until the sale was stopped.

"In order to show the magnitude of
this natural resource of the State and
nation and how its benefits reach to
every class of citizens, I shall quote a
few figures compiled from data fur
nished by the manufacturers of guns,
ammunition, fishing tackle and other
accessories used by those who hunt and
fish. These figures are exclusive of mil
itary supplies, pistols and pistol ammu
nition. There are 9,339,000 pounds of
iron and steel used in the manufacture
of guns, gun Implements and other
tools used exclusively by the sports

pounds of copper and brass and 73.430,

"The Supreme Court of the United
States, in Geer vs. Connecticut (161 U.
S., 530 quotes this decision with the
highest approval and adds: 'To hunt
and kill game is a boon or privilege,
granted either expressly or implicity
by the sovereign authority, not a right
inherent in the individual, and conse
quently nothing is taken away from
the individual when he is denied the
privilege at stated seasons of hunting
and killing game.' In th^e same case
the Supreme Court of the United States
quotes from a decision of the Supreme
Court of Minnesota on the sale of game
as follows: "Which limitations depriv*
no person of his property, because he
who takes or kills game had no pre
vious right to it, and when he acquires
such right by reducing it to possession
he does so subject to such conditions
and limitations as the Legislature has
seen fit to imuose. 1
"All these decisions have been ren
dered In establishing the justice and
legality of laws prohibiting the sale of
game. I might add a score more, .for
these laws have been upheld by the Su
preme Court of every State in the Un
ion wherever they have been ques
tioned. This part of the subject having
passed beyond argument, l?t us take up
the expediency of and reason for these
laws.
HIGHEST COURT SPEAKS.
"I am pleased to see The Call take
this broad and liberal stand and offer
its columns to the discussion of the
subject by those who have given the
question that study necessary to make!
their opinions of value to the public.
Having given the subject the closest
study for the last twenty-five years,
and having spent a large portion of
my time in gathering statistics rela- i
tive to its value as a resource of the I
commonwealth, its rapid destruction j
and the causes thereof, I avail myself i
of v your kind offer, thanking you for
giving the friends of the game so val- J
uable a medium for explaining not
only the necessity but the justice of
the proposed changes. Â«
"The general public looks upon the
game as vagrant and without owner
ship, or as nothing but a plaything
for that cjass commonly called sports
men. Nothing can be more erroneous
than either of these views, in proof of
which I will quote from a decision of
the Supreme Court (103 CaL 476).
The court says: The wild game with
in a State belongs to the people in
their collective sovereign capacity. It
is not the subject of private owner
ship except in so far as the people
may elect to make it so, and they may,
if they see fit, absolutely prohibit the
taking of it or traffic and commerce
in it.'

sociation, has submitted to The Call the
following communication in support of
the scheme to prohibit the sale of game ;
within the confines of the State: \
"Editor Call: In an article on game j
laws in your issue of November 16 j
you say: "N'o doubt something is to j
be said in their favor by those who Â¦
propose the changes and they should J
make themselves heard if they have i
aught to say that will bring to their j
aid the public opinion which will be j
found necessary to pass the law they j
propose.' i
"Twelve years ago we stopped the
sale of deer meat. When this was done
the same element that is now opposing
the prohibition of the sale of ducks
cried aloud, filling the air with their
wails and predicting all manner of ca
lamities therefrom. Yet for twelve
years our people have prospered with
out the sale of venison. Four years
ago the sale of quail was stopped, and
the same people and the same papers
painted the same stock pictures of suf
fering and privation. Still no financial
crisis has overtaken the community;
no starvation has resulted and no epi
demic has seized upon the wealthy be
cause quail on toast was taken from
their bill of fare. And I am persuaded
that w.hen the sale of ducks is stopped
PLAN WORKS WELL.
"The rich men, who always raise a
kick when denied the privilege of
buying- game in the market, should
be satisfied to let well enough alone,
for they receive annually from the
manufacturers and dealers the com
fortable sum of $2,640,000 for rents
and certainly not less than another
two million, for the rents of the houses
in which these J.18,611 persons and
those dependent upon them live. At
the smallest estimate, there are three
persons dependent upon each wage
earner. This will give us 474,444 per
sons directly supported by the money
spent by those who^hunt and fish. In
order to get a fair conception of the
magnitude of the business created by
the existence of the supply of game
and fish, let us suppose that all thi3
business was conducted in one place.
"In that rase we would have a city
considerably larger than San Fran
cisco, without counting numerous peo
ple that would find employment in ca
tering to their wants, such as dry
goods merchants, clothiers, grocers,
shoe dealers, butchers, bakers, millin
ers, dressmakers, tailors, druggists,
dentists, doctors, car drivers, vege
table and fruit dealers and dairy men,
as well as the carpenters, bricklayers,
painters and plasterers to build and
keep in repair the houses in which
they live. And still there would be
the farmers and fruit and vegetable
raisers, and the cattle and sheeD and
chicken raisers to furnish the food
upon which they all would live. De
stroy the game and the employment
of all these people would cease. And
by the same token, reduce It and the
employment will be correspondingly
reduced.
SPEXD MOXEY OTHERWISE.
'"But great as this may seen* it. la
nowhere near the full benefits derived
from a good supply of game. The
money those who hunt and fish spend
for their guns and rods and ammuni
tion is a small part of what their
sport costs them. Their railroad and
stage fares, their hotel bills, livery
bills, boat hire, rent of preserves and
the wages of the men who care for
them, amount to fully Jhree times the
cost of their ammunitldrT^nd fifes. ~*
"This, in the aggregate, amounts,
in the United States, to more than
$175,000,000 annually. Of this vast
sum it is known, from reliable statis
tics, that upward of $8, 750.000 - i3
spent in California by those who lov#
the sports of the field and stream.
This is more than twice the cost of
every pound of flour consume) in the
State. Men who have never studied
the subject, nay, men who have never
taken the time to think, have made
the assertion that game laws are en
acted for the sole benefit of the
sportsmen. Yes, if it is a benefit to
the sportsmen of California to pre
serve them a means through which
they can spend $3,750,000 every year.
But I believe that every thoughtful
citizen will agree with me in saying
that the wage earner and producer
are the real beneficiaries. The sports
roan's interest, as such, In the game
is a money spending one. The interest
of all others is a money making one.
"Some of the papers speak of the
prohibition of the sale of game as if It
was a new and monstrous innovation
another evidence of a lack of knowl
edge on the subject. The truth is
thirty-eight States and Territories â
about all that have any game to pro
tectâprohibit the sale of game killed
In the State, and most of them of all
game, no matter where it is killed.
Washington, Montana, Idaho, Wyom
ing, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and even
the Territories of Arizona and New
Mexico, prohibit the sale of game, and
Oregon allows only the sale of ducks
the last two weeks of the open season.
Nor is it much of an innovation in Cal
ifornia.

to say that 118,611 wage-earners of
the United States find annual employ

and fish.

Dear maid, the message penned by thy fair hand
An act of wisdom shall suggest to me ,

And so, fair captive, I must bid thee stay

HOME COOKERY.
MR. ISRAEL ZAXGWILL, the Jewish writer and leader
among the Zionists, has been conducting a crusade among
his people of New York along the lines of action inspired
by the late Dr. Theodore Herzl, the creator of the idea of a reunited
Jewry. The success attending bis efforts both in England and this
country show that the cause of Zionism has gone beyond the first
stage of enthusiasm, which was largely fostered by the personal
influence of its recently deceased leader, and that it can now be
reckoned as a permanent factor in the future of the scattered peoples
The London novelist introduces a new. idea into the scheme for
a permanent Jewish state, an idea that probably will not find wide
favor even among the most earnest of the workers. Despairing of
building up a new Judea in the land of the ancient domain of the
Hebrew kings, Mr. Zangwill advocates the establishment of the
new Jerusalem in the British principality of Uganda on the West
African coast, keeping Palestine only as an ideal goal to be ob
tained when the Turk shall have relinquished his hold upon it in the
possible contingencies of future necessity.' He urges, that Uganda
presents not a desert, but the richness of a tropical jungle land ; that
natural resources would be such as to assure the growth of a strong
and wealthy agrarian state there in the very choicest of Africa's
fertile lands. The milk and honey of old Canaan would flow again
in the new Palestine on Africa's shore.
Whether or not Mr. Zangwill's departure from the original pro
paganda of Zionism finds followers is scarcely material to the
growth and influence of the cause. The great work which the move
ment is doing to-day is that of revivifying the spirit of fellowship and
cementing the community of interest between the Jews of Europe
and America. Born of it is the idea of nationality. The Zionist
considers himself not merely a member of a race, but one of a na
tion whose destiny can f be fulfilled only when once again the walls
of the temple are reared. Until the theoretical spirit of Zionism
finds acceptance everywhere the practical; may. be held in abeyance.
Uganda and Palestine are both far in the future; to-day only the
seeds of the ancient prophecy may be sown.

Editor The Call: Allow me, as an old
fireman, to thank you for your recent
editorial on "Rail Disasters." I truly
hope that all railroad managers
and those who employ men who
work on the railroad have read It.
One thing, however, you missed and
that is there are too many boys em
ployed who do not realize the im
portance of their position and who
are careless of their duties. Superin
tendents keep them jus,t because they
are good, jolly fellows. As you say,
they depend on luck too much. En
gineers and firemen who are always
looking for some girl to wave at com
ing into the stations rather than at
tending to their duties are poor men
for people to ride with.
The companies would do well to have
out some spotters to see if men at
tend to their duties as they should.

man for he knows Just when and

DUTIES OF TRAINMEN.
It was also 1 found that the vision*
was quicker than the rifle ball, for the
eye could anticipate the arrival of the
bullet At the target, see the bullet and
watch the target for it to strike.
The sportsmen were able to study
the bullets* flight until the light
changed. : : V
The rifles used were a .30- Win
chester,, a 130 Marlin, a .45.90 Win
chester and a .38-55 Winchester, and
the bullets from them were observed
without the aid of field glasses.
Some. sportsmen who were not pres
ent on the afternoon of the target
practice mentioned were not inclined
to accept the story, and lt'was for
their observation and benefit "that a
second series of experiments was held.
The guns used on this occasion were
a .38-55 and a .38-40 of Winchester
patterns, each firing factory ammuni
tion.
It was observed that some of the
bullets traveled with greater speed
than others, owing 1 to a slight varia
tion in the loading machines at; the
cartridge factory. The speedy bullets
appeared with a thinner line of light
than the slow ones.
It was nearly 4 p. m. and the sun
was shining at a favorable angle. Cal
lahan v/as able to point out to his
friei.ds silver streaks "which traveled
from the gun to the target at etch shot.
The bullets appeared like glimpses of
telephone wire glistening In the sun
light, the metal reflecting the rays of
the sun. â¢
Several of the gunners laughed "t

The Sacramento Valley has never quite had justice done it. The
orange grew on the lawns in Sacramento, Marysville, Colusa, Chico
and Oroville, and long prior to the planting of such trees the. lonely
orange tree at Bidwell's Bar, sprung from a chance seed, had
flowered and fruited since the mining days. But it is scarcely
fifteen years since the planting of extensive orchards began/ Now
they are numerous from Porterville to Oroville. T,he field has
crossed the Sacramento Valley and the orange is grown in the
Coast Range and Cloverdale is a citrus center. The crop '.of the
world is destined to be grown in California. Consul .Tourgee, at
Bordeaux, officially reports that the . California navel orange is
regularly in the market there and in other parts of France,;
The Sacramento Valley people are determined that the; citrus
capacity of that valley and of Northern California shall no) longer
be hid under a bushel, and great credit is theirs for good work j to
that end in St. Louis. .
making the longest citrus iruit season that is enjoyed anywhere in
the world. This length of season is a California specialty, a peculiar
result of our climate, which like a patriot knows no North, no v South,
but is the same through one thousand miles of latitude.
The orange growers of the Sacramento Valley have availed
themselves of the closing weeks of the St. Louis Exposition by
shipping great quantities of these fine orange's there, all labeled
and identified as the Sacramento Valley fruit. Reports from St.
Louis vindicate the wisdom and enterprise of the valley .people.
The orange is still an expression of luxury, though the California
production has cheapened its cost so that anybody who can eat
apples may also eat oranges. It is also a golden witness to climate
that bears any kind of cross-examination. Where the orange is
produced in perfection, never touched by frost, always sure of mak
ing a crop, all men know there must be clemency of climate.

THE President last week introduced to a Washington audience
Dr. Wagner, who has published a book on "The Simple Life."
Wagner is said to have many of the traits of Thoreau. Thoreau,
it will be remembered, went through Harvard, but refused to receive
his diploma, saying that a piece of lettered sheepskin would add
nothing to his knowledge. His life was the simplest possible, but
none have given a more charming view and interpretation of nature
Dr. Wagner has applied the rule of simplicity and sincerity in
his book, and has properly interpreted the strenuous life as put by
President Roosevelt in his' book under that title. More than a thou
sand years ago Alfred the Great of England said : "It is not wise for
man to seek too soft a life." Many have taken simplicity to m/jan
softness and enervation, and strenuosity to mean feverishness, and
restless adventure. Neither is true. The simple life means strenuous
endeavor to meet the true ideals, to be helpful of others, void of
mean envy, and to use exertion to found, build and maintain' a home.
These Wagner calls the substance and not the show of things.
Senator Stanford once entered upon an examination of the things
necessary to his comfort and existence and found that he could sup
ply these all on an income of $40 a month. He was himself far from
being an inconspicuous example of the simple life. Being entirely
without the ostentation of ownership he moved among his vast pos
sessions in such an attitude that, to the stranger, the foreman, the
superintendent and even the ambitious groom who cared for his
horses of world-wide celebrity seemed more the owners than he.
It is not in any special division of society that we must look for
the simple life. It is found everywhere. It lives in the heart and
mind and disposition more than in the artificial surroundings. There
is no doubt that the American people have been going away from
simplicity in life for more than forty years. The process seems to
have started in the Civil War. That war fixed the national thought
on glory and pomp and circumstance. Gradually the difference be
tween use and vain show grew less distinct and living for appear
ances spread through all parts of society, an iridescent but an evil
-wave. The maxims of Ben Franklin, which were a positive influence
during the first three quarters of our national existence, were lost
sight of. and keeping up appearances became of more seeming im
portance than seeking the true happiness by being sincere.
Now a turn of the tide is felt. We believe that this turn is due
more to President Roosevelt than to any other single individual. He
has seen every phase of life and in all his public addresses which
touch its great issues he recurs again and again to the simple, inde
pendent and contented conditions which are the genuine substance
of things. So he has said: "It remains true now as it has always
been that in the last resort the country districts are those in which
we are surest to find the old American spirit, the old American habits
of thought and ways of living. Conditions in the country have
changed far less than they have in the cities, and in consequence
there has been little breaking away from the methods of life which
have produced the great majority of the leaders of the republic in
the past. Almost all of our great Presidents were brought up in the
country.' and most of them worked hard on farms in their youth and
got their early mental training in the healthy democracy of farm life.
The countryman, the man on the farm, more than any other of our
citizens to-day, is called upon continually to exercise the qualities
which we think of as typical of the United States through all its his
tory â the qualities of rugged independence, masterful resolution and
individual energy and resourcefulness. The man who tills his own
farm, whether on the prairie or in the woodland, who grows what we
eat and the raw material which is worked up into what we wear, still
exists more nearly under the conditions which obtained when "the
embattled farmers n of '76 ma'de this country a nation than is true of
any others of our people.
These and numerous other expressions by the President explain
the sympathy between him and Dr. Wagner which brought them to
gether before an audience in Washington. They explain also the ob
vious change in the direction of thought and practice that is being
felt all over the country. There is everywhere a turning away from
show and shadow. The great intellectual organizations of the coun
try, and especially the women's clubs, are accelerating this move
ment. The tawdry and garish in dress and decoration are passing
away. Soon architecture and all art will feel the new impulse. It
will penetrate the colleges and common schools. The education of
the people will lose its gewgawry and go back to the necessary* and
substantial. Life will lose in glare but will gain in comfort. Then a
host of evils will disappear. The simple life is a remedy for the di
vorce evil. It will exterminate more diseases than medicine can
cure and will come nearer abolishing poverty than any of the artifi
cial schemes for reorganizing society.
The subject is not a bad Sunday study nor an indifferent theme
for Sunday sermons. It may well enlist the interest of the secular
press and become a fascinating subject for the lecture platform.

One of her hearers confessed to me

make one last final charge when she

"I did not." She faced him with
proud, hurt eyes and flushed cheeks. '
He laughed with a riotous sense of
happiness in her pain. If he still had
the power to hurt her there was hope.
It was the reckless hour.
*i<o: forever!' she retorted passion
ately. "I never wanted to see you
again."
Until it was over?"
"Don't; please, please don't." . *
"say you are glad to see me."
"I'm not glad to see you. You went
away of your own free will. I wish
you had stayed."
"Fair to whom?"
"To him."
Thornton's jaws squared aggressively.
"He hasn't anything to say about it
yet. You needn't be frightened. The
wolf won't eat you. Won't they even
let you be glad or sorry?"
Thornton ignored the discrimination.
Ho was gazing intently at the pale
young face. It must be true all he had
heard at the club. She did not look
happy. It was Vic Wilmington's affair,
the digging up of Estevan. She al
ways had some two-for-a-penny title
tagging after her. It was only three
weeks off now. The thought brought
with it a flash of recklessness. They
would have her for a lifetime. To-night
for one short half hour she was his. He
leaned toward her suddenly.
'"Gladys, are you sorry to see me?"
"Don't." Her eyes met his In half
defiant entreaty. "It isn't fair."
"I was with Mrs. Culverton. She was
in the third box, and I was late. Then
Cully cajne along and took her home

to wait for you, but he wanted to go
directly home, so I took his place. You

"Oh, yes,. I do. At lease I believe

I believe that Mr. Culverton was asked
to wait for me."
''Of course there is Â«. mistake. There
always is when I come in for anything

for you." *

She had volunteered going back to the

in the velvet arm of Aunt Victoria's
chair, just where she had left it.
"Did you think that I was never com
ing?" she asked, as she reached the
carriage. The figure turned quickly at
the sound of her voice, and she found
herself looking into Thornton's eyes.
She caught her breath and stopped ab
ruptly, startled and hesitating, afraid
to let him guess the great fi6od of glad
ness that swept over her at sight of
him. When one believes a person to be
in Manchuria it is somewnat bewilder
ing to meet that person alone on Broad

door for her.

She met his steady gaze, defiantly at
first, then in open confession as he said,
and before he knew it she had covered
her face with her hands and was cry
ing. He felt suddenly helpless and
ashamed.
"Gladys, don't do that. I'm "a brute,

He smiled slowly and happily. She
had not heard yet of the accumulated
possessions.
"We've turned out of the park," he
said. "I don't want to go to the house
and face a crowd. Gladys, look at me.
No, straight in the eyes, please! Try
to think quickly. I've come all the
way around the world to see you. I've 7

was afraid before, and I ran away like
a coward, and d{dn't even give you the
chance to refuse me. Will you refuse
me now?"
"No, I cannot." Her eyes met his
with calm, defensive candor. "Of
course I loved you. Do you think I
would have kissed you that day if I
had not? And you are right about the
other, too. I shall always love you."
He bent toward her with keen, half
shut eyes.
"And yet in three weens you will be
his wife."
There had been no thought during
the year of work but of Gladys. He
had left on the first boat for home to
claim the promise of the tunnel kiss,
and had found instead Estevan, a war
ranted, imported antique, tall, suave
and slightly gray, with an eye out for
ready money.
The thought of it all made him des
perate ttr-night. He put her from him
almost roughly. In three weeks she
would be the Countess E3tevan, chate
laine of some dinky little old castellated
ruin in Austria. He was sorry that
he had tried, to see her, sorry he had
come back, sorry he had made Culver
ton change places with him.
"You had better stop crying." he said.
"We'll be there in a few minutes. Es
tevan might not like it." .
She smiled back at him, her eyes
bright with tears.
"So you try to frighten the bad little
girl into good behavior? Well, she
doesn't scare worth a cent. Darby.

"What do you mean?"
"Can't you guess? You expect others
to be so good at guessing, you know.
You expect to kiss a girl and go away
to Manchuria, or was it the moon? and
then come back and find love in her
eyes, what was it? Like this?"
She was laughing at him. He felt
angry and obstinate.
"Can you say that you never loved
me?"
was all he could do. He thought she
would understand. If not, there ,was
no danger but Mrs. Wilmington would
enlighten her.
The Manchuria business had been an
opening held out by the old Darby
Thornton for some time. It was a
chance to make good by going: out there
and clearing up the old boy's mercan
tile interests before the war. broke out.
He had stuck to it and had made good,
and the reward had come most unex
pectedly when said old boy had taken
a notion to die comfortably and oppor
tunely, and leave his accumulated pos
sessions to the prodigal in the far land.

running over" has been returned upon
all such transactions. .
This is the season when selfishness
is caught out and kindliness has Its
inning. These are the days when the
generous man finds congenial tasks, but
they are dull times for the selfish man.
â¢ How apt a thing it Is that this clos
ing season of the year should begin
with a day of thanksgiving and end
with a day of giving â apt and yet not
preconcerted. We owe Christmas to
one branch of the Christian church
and Thanksgiving to quite another
branch, so the . now accepted order
was not prearranged. It simply grew
out of the eternal fitness of things â
first to be thankful for blessings re
ceived and then to give. Each festival
seems to demand the other.
The man who is out of sympathy
with this closing season of the year is
guilty of the allied vices, ingratitude
and stinginess. From friends, society,
native land, from God above all he
receives the good things of life and
never says "Thanks." With a life
crowned with good things and with
people all around with whom he could
well share his goods â¢ he grips \ his
purse in an iron grasp.
He is out of sympathy with the
grateful, out of sympathy with the
kind, out of sympathy with the whole
glad and busy community. Poor fel
low! Let's pity htm and fill up his
stocking on Christmas eve. Perhaps
his one remaining virtue is a sense of
shame.
These are the days when some of
those hoary old maxims of respectable
selfishness, such as "business is busi
ness'' â by which is meant that any
amount of grasping and pinching and
squeezing is allowable if by those
means figures can be piled up on the
right side of the cash book; these are
the days when men see the fallacy of
that kind of sentiment and blush for
it. On these ripe days of the year men
look back over the months that have
passed and they see that, irrespective
of the cash book, the transactions and
investments that have paid best have
been those which have been
actuated by the spirit of brother
ly kindness. These transactions and
Investments draw compound interest-
Men who have done business of this
kind are constantly surprised by the
returns it brings in. "Good measure,
pressed down, shaken together and
generosity.
Is it, I say, a mere accident that the
season pre-eminent for its giving
should also be pre-eminent for its hap
piness? Is it not rather the operation
of the law of cause and effect? When
are so many bright faces to be seen
on the streets. In the homes â both of
the rich and of- the poor, in the hos

wrongs, contemptible in themselves,
but mighty in their evil consequences,
which have been allowed to live on,
simply for the want of unselfish cham
pions of the truth. What the annual
outburst of the spirit giving should
bring to us this yearâ the best Christ
mas present the * whole community
could haveâ would be a few more men
self-sacrificing enough to give them
selves "as the tireless foes of unright
eousness and champions of the good.
Think of the deserving poor, the vic
tims of poverty â not of purse alone,
i but of mind and body and spiritâ who
have gone on In their want simply be
! cause selfishness has found it inconven
ient to help. Think of the rudeness
and lack of consideration *,. hich have
ruthlessly marred so many lives, and,
all because the selfish man .ias been
too busy thinking of himself to study
and practice the art of kindness. In
this, the busy season of generosity, let
us think of these things and learn the
lessons they suggest.
Is It an accident that these last clos
ing weeks of the year are marked by
exceptional generosity and exceptional
happiness? There can be no doubt as
to these two facts. In these closing
weeks of the old year's life there is
more giving of gifts than during all
the other nine-tenths of the year com
bined. There are gifts to relatives,
gifts to friends, gifts to the poor, gifts
"to "causes," footing up a splendid to
talâalmost all coming within the
weeks between Thanksgiving and New
Year's. This is the grand festival of
finds this part of the year unsatis
factory-fa dull season. .This, is the
harvest time of love and kindness and
good cheer. May the harvest ever be
increased, and the glad reapers more
busy.
There are times enough in the
year when it appears, to . those
who are not blessed with very
good memory or much insight
as though the selfisn man had
really, the right idea of living. The
man whose philosophy can be com
pressed into the' old saw, "Look out
for number one," can under most con
ditions manage to maKe what looks
like a fair demonstration of that phil
osophy. But there certainly are times
when men see more clearly than at
other times, when their memories reach
back further,, and at such times the
weakness of the selfish man's position
Is. sure to be seen. Selfishness thrives
partly from lack of consideration. Liv
ing in houses made up too largely of
glass we hesitate : about throwing
stones. At this time of the year, how
ever, when generosity bpth flowers and
fruits, it is easy to muster up courage
and condemn this vice, so common
among us. The selfish man's theory, is
false; for the best and happiest and
most v prosperous man is that one who
looks out not alone for "number one,"
but for others who are around â who
loves his neighbor as himself.
Think of the resultsâ Olg and littleâ
of selfishness; how they have marred
the life of the community in the last
nine and a half months. Think of the
It is the busiest part of the year for
all who enter into -the spirit of the
Â¦eason. The people in the stores are
Â¦worked most to death, and are rather
glad of it. They are prepared to die
happy while at such work. The people
in the homes are busy, working day
and night, behind locked doors and
with great mystery, and as weariness
grows happiness increases to soothe it.
Of all people the children are >he
busiestâ busy and bursting with se
crets. But there is one kind of creature
to whom this glad and busy season is
deadly dullâ the selfish man. The kind
cf work which is keeping other people
eo busy is not of Interest to him..Dur
lng these days all the busy people seem
to be working only for others and that
iÂ« entirely out of the selfish man's line.
He feels euperior to all the follies of
thji midwinter madness, but for some
THE best part of the year has
arrived. Into these closing
weeks there will be distilled
all the 'lights which the full
year has gathered. Beginning
with Thanksgiving day and ending
Â¦with Christmas and New Year's, the
real harvest of the year progresses. All
the helpfulness and charity and good
cheer which the wise man has been
scattering around him during the year
now ripens and repays him a hundred
foid. Good friends gather his harvest
for him and fill his arms with the gold
en sheaves.
. No, there is nothing very surprising
in the fact that the year always goes
out in dullness for \he selfish man.
Christendom has conspired â no matter
what philosophy has dominated the
earlier part of the year â that at least
the last five weeks of every year shall
be governed by love and the thought
of others. While the selfish man con
tinues his selfishness I am glad he
gripping the coins in his pockets he
will watch the busy Christmas shop
pers, and frown at the smiles on their
faces. He hates those silly people, for
they keep up the Christmas sentiment
and by the "very weight of the senti
ment they foster compel even the self
fish man to . feign a celebration. By
every grudging gift he makes he feels
himself defrauded. Who earned this
money which must be spent for Christ
mas? Who loves this money most?
Who would most appreciate the things
this money can buy? To each of the
questions the selfish man says: "I."
He hates Christmas, for Christmas robs
him. And after all, isn't the selfish
man wise when he hates Christmas?
What interest can such a man feel in
the birth, or life and death of One
who was at once the typical gift and
typical giver of all history? The sel
fish man's quarrel' with Christmas is
well founded and logical. His im
pulses are unerring when they con
strain him to hate the birthday of Him
who said: "It is more blessed to give
than to receive;" and then exemplified
His own philosophy by giving His life
for men.
l^y God pity the man who had no
home in which to celebrate Thanks
giving dayi but may He also deal
wisely with that man who, hav
ing a home, either slighted altogether
that sacred day or went through with
the celebration of it grudgingly.
Thanksgiving was a dull day for that
man. And now we are fairly started
toward Christmas. For the next few
weeks most people will be thinking 'of
nothing else 'so much as of that glad
day. With &.U who respond to the real
spirit of Christmas the happiness of it
will increase with every day. But the
selfish man will only grow more un
easy, and for him -each succeeding day
will grow more dull. With his hand
What Is Thanksgiving day- to the man
who lives wholly within himself and
for himself? â¢ Only a day of grudged
ertravagance. On that day when, to
all right hearted men, the family table
becomes a family altarâ laden with of
ferings to the God of the home â with
father and mother Jointly officiating as
priest and priestess, on that day the
selfish man is particularly unhappy.
Under pressure of custom he has been
compelled to expend on this folly most
as much as his cigars will cost during
a whole month and it fills him with re
sentment.
reason the fueling of superiority doesn't
satisfy. That little world (himself) in
which hÂ» lives doesn't seem quite so

part of the year. So this is the selfish

was made by F.'Ar Brush of city
to the school board.- Just at. oresent
museums of Philadelphia to be placed
in the public schools throughout Penn
sylvania. An experiment made with
several of these exhibits a few years
ago became so popular that the Legis
lature was besieged with requests to
have them prepared on a large scale.
Last year an appropriation of $25,000
was made for this purpose.
.The value of school fire drills was
shown November 9 during a fire in
Public School No. 17 in New York
City. Under the management of the
teachers all of the X500 children march'

breaking from the ranks, though every
one ! - the building was on fire. The
school was emptied in record time and
when the firemen arrive*! there was no
one in the building to Interfere with
their work. These fire drills take place
in every New York public school as
often as once a fortnight and may be
called at any moment during .study
hour or recess time. The regulations
provide for records of every, emergency
drill, giving time of first signal and
the actual time of dismissal. Other
rules are in force, having in view the
possible failure of signals, as well as
the assignment of certain teachers to
definite locations, from which direc
tions are to be given.
Santa Rosa is in straits to furnish the
school children with accommodations
and a bond issue is suggested for the
erection of one or two school houses.
Mr. Brush proposes to supply all the
stone needed for. one of the buildings,
delivered at the quarry without cost to
the board. : Such benefactions are sure
to increase with the growing wealth
of California and the enlarging con
sciousness that the urgent educational

presented the high ideals which . may
inspire every teacher and the fullness
of power to which every teacher may

i Five " hundred commercial exhibits
are being prepared by the commercial
Magazine. This article gives an ac
count of the Chicago School of Edu
cation,'which is connected with the
University of Chicago. Here there is
little need of discipline, as that Is or
dinarily understood, for from the first
grade upward Â¦ the child's attention is
absorbed in fascinating occupations.
It is a school where not only the child
"learns to do by doing," but what : is
of vital importance, learns while do
ing. For'the most , effective work' the
children are divided into groups. In
one of the rooms the little folks may
be noticed as engaged in playing at
farmirigwith boxes of earth in which
various grasses arid /grains are . sown.
Each.day the children come to mark
the growth ; and changes. In summer
this time -is spent in work and obser
vation out of doors. In other rooms
children may be seen using ma-ny kinds
of tools, or occupied 'in cooking, sew
ing, basket making, drawing; or paint
ing.; One group is busy with mixing

Presfdent Prltchett placed before the
alumni of his institute a proposal for
such a union it was received with
marked disfavor. Later thought and
consultation, however, are bringing
the support of leading minds in both
institutions. The institute," or "Boston
Tech," as it is familiarly called. Is the
second technical school -in afce in the
United States, and in the forty years
since its' doors were . first opened . has
with its twelve or fifteen courses in
chemistry, electricity. . mining, en
gineering and allied subjects furnished
the finest and most. thorough instruc
tion on scientific lines. It. is. not say
ing too much that its 2000 graduates
scattered all over the world have. been
leaders in the .world's progress ; and
material development. , By the (pro
posed union of interests the institute
will doubtless continue ; to , receive - its
accustomed income 'from the State of
Massachusetts, the benefit of its own
large endowments > and, further, '.will
have the advantage n of the I fund of
$600,000 recently given to Harvard
University for science teaching.
One of the most attractive schools
in the country Is described in. the:in

IT cannot be doubted that a great
boon ha6 lately come to Califor
nia through the establishment of
the Polytechnic School at San
Luis Obispo. This is a State in
stitution of high school rank in
v.hich no charge is made for tuition.
Prominent, if rot chief, among its ben
efits is the thorough and scientific in
struction given in agriculture. No
teaching of greater material value,
present and future, can be offered in
this State. The course is one of three
years. In the first year the work is
the same for students in agriculture
and in mechanics. During the second
yea.r while due attention is given to
mathematics, chemistry, English and
drawing, the number of periods per
week devoted to agriculture is Increas
ed to twelve. In the third and last
year the agricultural subjects are given
fifteen periods each week- It is to be
understood that as this school has for
one of its chtef objects the training of
young men for farming, an intelligent
understanding of the problems of -their
life work must involve familiarity, with
a broad curriculum. This : embraces
some knowledge of the general princi
ples of physics, and a more intimate
acquaintance with , agricultural cbem-
ittry relating to the soil, air,
crops and manures. Botany calls for
study of roots, stems and leaves and
the influence of heat, cold and moist
ure. Lectures and recitations on agri
culture include discussions on tillage,
alkali soils, rotation of crops and farm
management. Horticulture deals with
the special theories and practice ' of
fruit growing in California and all that
relates to the care of vines and trees.
Animal industry and poultry require
thorough studies of breeding and feed
ing. ' Dairying, forestry, irrigation and
veterinary science also claim consid
erable time- The practical work done
in this school will be increased as
rapidly as the State supplies the equip
ment- Students . may enter from the
eighth grade of grammar schools. Of
fifty-two enrolled in this, the second
year of the school, twenty are regis
tered for agriculture.
It Is apparent that the school'world
furnishes no exception to the sweep
of the mighty social and economic
forces of this age. Consolidation "and
concentration 6eem to be two -of its
watchwords. A late, instance; of this
world-wide impulse is seen in the plan
for. association of the Massachusetts
Institute " of Technology . with Harvard

Miss Thomas' way of being funny is
not the usual way. She begins with
a voice like a catarrhal steam whis
tle. She is frankly, enthusiastically,
robustly vulgar, digging the audience
in the ribs with Bowery witticisms
until it crows. She swops "cheek"
with the conductor like a true, lidy,
imitates a Bowery "artiste" with a
very glory of toughness, and dances,
zips through the piece in a generally
irresistible fashion. She "doesn't
want to be a lidy" she sings, and
doesn't beautifully,' but Miss Thomas
can't help being a riproariously funny
comedian. Her material? Pretty
much anything that Miss Thomas
pleases, apparently. Her part is that
of the ingenue of the Sopholes Dra
matic Company, whose wanderings
form the staple of the piece. But see
her. for fun.

OCEAN BEACH SALES
Davidson & Leigh, acting for Ethel
Lincoln, have purchased the three ad
joining properties to her southeast cor
ner of Second and Clementina streets,
which Include the lot, 20x60 feet, on the
northeast line of Second street, 20 feet
southeast of Clementina, formerly
owned by Elizabeth Clinton, and two
smaller pieces In the rear of the corner,
facing on Clmentina street, for an ag
gregate sum of about $15,000. This pur
chase gives Miss Lincoln a corner 45x105
feet.
"With the approach of the rainy sea
son the letting of. large building con
tracts has naturally fallen off, but real
estate men feel well satisfied with the
outlook and have no complaint to make
of the present "between season" period.
One of the most important sales made
in the district south of Market street
was closed through Davidson & Leigh
this week, when the southwest corner
of Fifth and Folsom streets was sold
by Mrs. Helena Schlessinger to Mrs.
Rosalie J. Colombat for a consideration
in the neighborhood of $42,500. The lot.
which has a frontage of 90 feet on
Fifth street and 75 feet on Folsom, was
purchased by the late A. Schlesslnger
in 1901 for about $35,000. The Improve
ments consist of frame stores and fiats,
which will be modernized to some ex
tent, and the property will then be held
as a permanent investment by the pur
chaser.
Some of the recent minor sales made
by Davidson & Leigh are as follows:
For Lulu Schwartz, lot and six-room
cottage on the south line of Twenty
fourth street, 50 feet east of Alabama,
to a client, for $2650; lot 20x75 feet, with
three flats, on the southwest line of
Morris avenue, 155 feet southeast of
Bryant street, for Julia Kelly to H. J.
Farrelly, terms private; for William A.
Burns, the southeast corner of Fif
teenth and Guerrero streets, 36x72 feet,
to Mrs. J. D. Soares, for $4500; for K.
M. Dahl,' lot on the north line of Day
street, 80 feet east of Noe. 25x114 feeW
for $750; for Clara Meyer, three fiats at
59. 61 and 63 Noe street, lot 25x162 feet,
to Morris Michael, for. $12,500.
Renting continues brisk, the demand
being at present for small fiats at from
$25 to $30. There are more people seek
ing comfortable fiats at this price than
can be accommodated, but business is
also good in the higher priced flats.
The subdivision of large ranches in
the Sacramento Valley has had the de
sirable effect of attracting hundreds of
homeseekers. C. M. "Wooster & Co. re
port that sales of forty-acre parcels of
land have Increased beyond their ex
pectation. The great Glenn ranch, for
instance, consisting of 44,000 acres, has
been subdivided and -houses are spring
ing up everywhere over the tract for
merly owned and farmed by one man.
Other large tracts will be taken up and
subdivided In the same manner as soon
as contracts can be made.
OUTLOOK IS PAVORABIiE.,
Near the park and the Ocean boule
vard trading continues brisk. Sol Getz
& Son have made several sales and re
port that fifteen contracts have recently
been let for new buildings in this dis
trict. These are all cottages, some to
bft occupied by their owners and others
for rental.
Trading In downtown realty during
the last week has been light, few sales
of moment being reported. In the out
lying districts it continues brisk and
the volume of business was equal to
that of the same period last year. The
largest downtown deals were the pur
chase of the block bounded by Front,
Battery, Green and Commerce streets
by W. P. Fuller & Co. for $112,000 and
the purchase of property on the east
side of First street, 80 feet south of
Howard, by the Selby Smelting and
Lead Company. This property adjoins
the Selby company's plant. The pur
chase price is reported to be $60,000.
The company will erect a salesroom
and warehouse on its newly acquired
property.

TITLED WOMAN WHO HAD NARROW
ESCAPE FTtOM DEATH BY SUFFOCA
TION IN HER APARTMENTS.
Somewhere in the northern seas the
old barkentine Quickstep, water
logged, deserted and rudderless, is
drifting a derelict. Her crew of ten
men and a dog was landed in this city
last night by the steamship Homer
after undergoing nine days of priva
tion and hardship and losing all their
personal belongings. The Quickstep's
crew was taken from the disabled ves
sel by the Tampico, Captain Jofin Rob
erts, bound from Seattle and Tacoma
to San Pedro. When off Grays Harbor
Captain Roberts transferred the crew
of the shipwrecked . vessel . to the
steamship Homer, which arrived last
night in this port, where a report of
the disaster was filed at the Merchants'
Exchange. .
The report was written by Captain
Roberts of the Tampico and recites
but the bare facts of the case. The
Tampico, it says, was bound from
Seattle, and Tacoma for San Pedro
Â¦with: a cargo .of general merchandise.
She ;left Tacoma Monday, November
21 Fi and encountered light winds and
a smooth sea until noon of Wednesday,
when a. fresh southeast wind sprang
up, increasing. steadily in violence. .
.Â¦ On . Thursday a . barkentine was
sighted/ flying signals of distress. Her
sails # were in rags and she rolled heav
ily. -Rain; was falling and the atmos
phere was so thick that it was impos
sible to make out the name of the dis
abled vessel. The Tampico at once
went to her relief, however, and upon
approaching closely made her out to
be the barkentine Quickstep, water
logged, rudderless and helpless.
Â¦ The captain of the barkentine sig
naled a request for a tou- to the near
est port, but Captain Roberts replied
that he could not possibly tow him In
as he did not have a hawser strong
enough. He. offered to take off the
crew before sundown and this offer
was accepted v /
Captain Johnson of the Quickstep
made preparations to take off his crew,
but while doing. so his foretopsail blew
away and the barkentine was left in a
worse position than ever. The Tampico
lay to for an hour, and as 'no further
attempt was made by the Quickstep to
launch a boat one was sent out from
the Tampico, in charge of Second Of
ficer George B. Genereaux, with four
seamen. /An attempt was made to get
the men off the lee quarter of the dis
abled vessel, but as the sea was run
ning high this was found to be Impos
sible. . The boat was then brought
around and the men lowered themselves
into it by sliding down a rope from the
end of the spanker boom. They man
aged to take their dog with them, but
left behind every stitch of clothing save
the oilskins they wore, and also lost
what personal belongings they pos
sessed. . â¢ . â ... ,
. Captain Johnson says . the Quickstep
first got In trouble on November 15,' and
from that date she had been in a water
logged condition, with the forecastle
and ; aft cabin stove In, the , boats
smashed and all the provisions wet. The
steering gear was washed away .and
the vessel opened fore and aft.
The members of the crew were in a
sorry state, worn . with long 1 watches
and hard work without sufficient sus
tenance. The dry berths and fresh fare
on the Tamoico were welcomed by the
men,' but they were: willing and eager
to accept a transfer off Grays Harbor
to the Homer, which landed them safe
ly in port last night.
The barkentine Quickstep was built
In 1876 "at Port Ludlow, Wash. She was
of r'423 tons, 148 feet, long, 34 feet in
breadth r and 13J feet deep. She was
owned by, S. B. Peterson of this city
and was â¢ engaged in- the Â¦ lumber trade
along the coast. When picked up" by
the Tampico she was nine days out of
Mukilteo and bound for San Francisco.

This and the. reported clause of the
treaty stipulating 1 that no other Govern
ment shall'have privileges in Tibet un
less approved by Great Britain has
aroused the deepest antagonism of
Russia, on the ground that this is a
virtual assumption of powers of sov
ereignty by the British.
It is announced *tn London, however,
that this text of the treaty is not cor
rect and that the treaty will be amend
ed before ratification so that it will "suit
everybody concerned.
Considerable opposition to the treaty
has become manifest in Peking. It is
doubtful if It will be really ratified
there. Before it is ratified the Russian
and British Governments undoubtedly
will measure their diplomatic strength
with the Chinese Government.

CALL BUREAU, JHOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Nj?v. 26.â England's
intentions in Tibet have, attracted the
careful consideration of the State, De
partment because of the vital relations
of the affairs of that country to the
American policy in support of the ad
ministrative entity of China. 5 There
have been some exchanges, of a thor
oughly informal character, between
Washington and London. The Wash
ington Government was long ago ad
vised by its Embassador in London that
no policy in contravention of the integ
rity of China was contemplated.
The text of the Anglo-Tibetan treaty,
already published, imposes upon the
Tibetans the payment of $2,500,000, Eng
land to remain in Tibet until this Is
paid. The sum Is so great as to assure
England pf practically permanent occu
pation of Tibet, the resources of that
people for payment being sadly limited.

shells with copper bands. Scratches
on these shells. Russian artillerymen
say, indicate that they were fired from
worn-out guns. It is evident that, the
Japanese are exerting every effort to
increase the number of their guns, and
In view of their lack of. quick-firing
artillery they are bringing up guns

by statements made by Chinese that
large numbers of worn-out ' cannon

" On November 24 an artillery duel

When a correspondent inquired at

This is significant of. the -firm atti

The committee's report contains the
following specific statement in con

, "Already Japan has made known
the conditions on which she is ready
to close hostilities. These consist' In
the return of Manchuria to China, the

belief that the opposing armies have
relaxed for the winter, together with
the unexpected demonstration of force
which the Russians have. been, able to
make since the depletion 6f their army
as the result of the ; fighting on'the
Shakhe' River, emphasizes conclusive
ly the failure of Japanese to prej
vent the assembly of 'a large Russian
army in Manchuria before spring, thus
defeating the strategy of the Japanese
and their, iriost plausible plans for the
earliest occupation of Manchuria.
This outcome, taken in connection
with the general situation, appears to

more terrible than any yet fought, and
points to the termination of the war in

that there will be a general attack

troops of either army to abandon their
present shelters.
Gradual alterations have taken place
in the different departments of the
Russian army since the abolition of the
vice royalty, as Alexieff's partisans
have returned to Europe with him.
The hostilities are now characterized
by individual exploits of a most daring
and dangerous character. One outcome
of the close relations between the Rus
sians and Japanese along the Shakhe
River has been the occasional blowing
up of houses by the opposing outposts
and the sniping of their occupants.
Russian speculators are
that the army will hold its own. and are
storing straw and other supplies with
a view to the coming of a time when
higher prices can be obtained. As has
been the case in all wars, there is wide
complaint that speculators and army
contractors are fleecing 'the Govern
ment, and the Russians are freely pro
nouncing them as the particular curse
of their country.

"Great progress has been made in
the study - of double stars 'since the
days of Herschel. The known systems
are numbered by the thousands and
the. current .work of Astronomers Hus
sey and Aitken has established that
of stars brighter than the ninth mag

eighteen is composed of two suns, vis
ible in our great telescope. , Although
the components in each pair appear to
be very close together, yet their dis
tances from each other are : so great,
in all cases, that'many years are re?,
quired :to/ complete one revolution. The
shortest; period, that of Delta Equulei,
is nearly six years. There .are only
thirty \or forty periods are less
than 100 '.years, and, in the . greater ma-,
jority of casVs, the periods will be ex

"The invention of the sp'ectrograph
and its application to the measurement

most..; Interesting 'extension of our
knowledge "of binary systems: We are
enabled to discover companion ' stars
so ' i " close together that the powerful
telescope cannot separate them. .In
fact their discovery becomes easier as
the distance between the components

VAn, interesting discovery -concerning
the; fainter of; the .two components of
Castor was made- nine "years ago by
Astronomer. .BelopolsHy , of the Russian
National Observatory at -.Pulkowa.
While engaged in measuring- the speed
with which ; the : two ' components are
traveling to pi* from -the observer he
discovered that' the speed of the fainter
component is variable. On- one night
the star would move" toward Â¦ the. solar
system;^ on another niglft it would
move rapidly in the opposite direction,
and later it Would prove to be rapidly
approaching... A long series^bt observa
tions, established that the speeds of this
star pass through. a complete cycle of
changft-in a little :less than three days.
The "explanation of the variable speed
is;thaVttiis star -is attended bv an in
visible^and very, close companion, mas
sive enough -to. swing the bright star
around in an elliptic orbit once every
three days.
"The purpose of this article is to
call attention, to .the .'discovery.;, just"
made at the Lick Observatory that the
other and brighter component of Cas
tor is likewise. attended by an invisible
component," which causes .the speed of
the bright star, to vary. At one time
it is approaching us '.and a fe\> -days
later it is receding. The. number of
days required for. the, bright 5tar and
the Â¦ invisible component to complete a
revolution about their center of mass
will not be known until a considerable
number of observations' have been se
cured, within the coming weeks. The
discovery was' made by Dr. Curtis,
using the Mills spectrograph attached

been proven by actual experiment 1
which anyone can perform for himself
in the following manner: Cut hard-

It would be if masticatedxplace the
egg and two or three of the tablets In
a bottle or Jar containing: warm water,
heated to 98 degrees (the temperature
of the body), and keep it at this tem-
perature for three and one-half hours,
at the end of which time the egg will
be as completely digested as It would
have been in the healthy stomach of

The point of this experiment is that

NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â Initial trans
actions In to-day's stock market were
made up largely of United States Steel
Issues, but before the end of the brief j
session business Increased in volume !

braced a great number of standard!
stocks. At the outset large blocks of j

motive. Amalgamated Copper respond
ed to buying by houses supposed to rep- I
resent Boston interests. The list fluctu
ated for a brief period, but shortly be
fore the publication of the bank state
ment a heavy buying movement set in.
There was a lively demand for Union
Pacific, Southern Pacific, Missouri Pa- j
cific. Southern Railway, Rock Island, j
Louisville and Nashville, Pennsylvania i
and others in the same gro,up. London \
bought Union and Southern Pacific,-;
and the extensive purchases of Erie ]
were probably for the acount of the ,
professional short interest. The market
remained active to the close and prices '
of many Issues were then the best of
the day. |
Total bond sales to-day, par value,
55,020,000.
The most striking feature of the
week was the heavy dealings, at high
prices, of the securities of the United
States Steel Corporation. It is gen
erally believed that some plan lnvolv- \
ing the further conversion of Steel pre
ferred into the sinking fund is contem
plated. Evidence accumulated that
i the iron and steel trades are steadily
Improving. Some of the other highly
speculative Issues more than held
j their gain3 of the past week. The of
ferings of new issues of securities as
exemplied in the sale of blocks in the
Union Pacific, Rock Island; Chicago,
S Burlington and Qulncy, Pennsylvania
and Marquette refunding bonds and
other less important Issues revived
\ discussion of refunding plans long dor
' mant and of consolidations of groups
: of subsidiary companies of some of
, the great railroad systems for con
venience of financial policy. This
marked clearly the passage of the era
of Indigestion In the securities market,
which occasioned borrowings of enor
: mous amounts of Pennsylvania, New
York Central and other powerful cor
porations during* the course of last
year and fer which high rates of inter- (
est was paid.
These borrowings were made neces
sary to keep alive projects already en
tered 'upon and which would have in
volved heavy losses by interruptions.
The ready sale of these securities is
perhaps the best evidence of the re
vival of confidence and of 'the absorp
tive power of the market, which is
entitled to the great encouragement
which it occasions. But it will prob
ably be availed of to a large extent to
fund into long-term obligations â¢ many
of the short-term, high interest-bear
ing obligations of the character above
indicated, and which will hang over
the market for occasional offerings in
considerable amounts for a year to
come.

rection of Commissioner James R. Gar
field. At that time Special Agents Dick
inson and Flannery, who have been
coached in their duties by Statistician
E. Dana Durand of the Department of
Commerce and Labor, will leave "Wash

will be reviewed by the department
chiefs, after which, if the evidence jus
tify, the officials of the Standard Oil
Company will be called into the office.
This first 'great move by the bureau
against the trusts is one of the most
significant occurrences under Mr.
Roosevelt's administration. One year
ago the Standard Oil Company refused
point blank to supply the bureau with
information which might throw light
upon its conduct of business. Previous
to that time certain agents of the com
pany had interfered with members of
Congress to the extent of sending tele
grams opposing the creation of the bu
reau with the powers it now has. More
recently, during the last campaign,
pressure was brought to bear upon
President Roosevelt by the company,
which sought to prevent further action
being taken.

On the fifth of December we discontinue the sale of our stock at 15
cents. On and after that date the price will be 17H cents per share, and
only a limited number of shares will be sold at that price. â¢ The value
of these shares is fullv demonstrated by the 1004 report of the UNITI?D
STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY. That Government report ranks our
coal with the celebrated POCAHONTAS STEAM COAL OF WEST
VIRGINIA and pronounces it SUPERIOR to any coal mined on the
borders of the Pacific Ocean, either in Alaska, Canada, United States or
Australia. TWELVE VEINS OF THIS FINE COAL SHOWING ON

invested in coal properties on my recommendation in the past five years.
There is more coal on the Alaska Petroleum and Coal Company's prop-
erty and the adjoining property than on all the properties sold on my rec-
ommendation for fifteen million dollars."
People who bought stock in the adjoining property in 1897 for 15 cents
h*ve sold their holdings for $10, $15, $20 and some of them for $30 per

ff WE HAVE ALL AGReIToN THIS SUBJECT^The news that freight is to be re
fused created much disappointment In
Reno and Tonopah to-day, for it means
a great deal to the mining people in the
camps. Superintendent Tripp of the
Tonopah road is now in San Francisco
conferring with the Southern Pacific
freight officials regarding the conges
tion, and it is believed that to-day's or
der is a result of an agreement between
the representatives of both roads. A
message received here to-night from
San Francisco stated that it will proba
bly twenty-five or thirty days be
fore new freight will be accepted by
the transportation companies. A cessa
tion of freight traffic is believed to be
the only means of amply providing the
thousands of people In the mining
camps with necessary. food for the win
ter months.
RENO. Nov. 26.â The agent of the
Southern Pacific Company to-day re
ceived notice from the general freight
office in San Francisco to the effect
that after November 29, until further
notice, the company would not receive
freight from any points along its big
system destined for Tonopah or Gold
field, except such freight as Is abso
lutely needful In the mining camps for
sustaining life of man and beast. It is
explained that this order is the result
of the recent congested condition of the
freight traffic between Reno and Tono
pah.
According to the figures of the rail
road company there are' at present
standing on the sidings 'between Reno
and Moundhouse 300 cars loaded with
freight awaiting shipment into the
mining camps, and recently there have
been half again as many carloads
standing in the same district
The newly built Tonopah railroad
has been supplied with additional cars
for the purpose of relieving the con
gestion, and although its entire rolling
.stock has been kept moving all the
time the supply of cars has been inade
quate for the requirements. In fact,
the business on the road has exceeded
by 100 per cent the amount that the of
ficials anticipated when the road was
built.

Robert B. Armstrong, Assistant Sec

the case opened, found the statue
without arms and entered upon his
returns "of no commercial value;

Following the adjustment at this
legal point the Government offered
the testimony of various residents of

Klnley and Miss Ware. Further tes
timony was introduced to show that
Mrs. Watson and Puter had been seen
In company with each other in con
nection with land deals.
The introduction of this* Instrument
was objected to on the ground that
the transfer took place after the con
spiracy is alleged to have been con
summated. .The Government argued
that the conspiracy did not end until
the Indictment was filed.
Judge O'Day objected to being
"done piecemeal and by this scalping
process," but his objection waa over

Ing to the deed, and the witnesses are

Leonard, and acknowledged by Leon

PORTLAND, Nov. 2S.â When the trial
of the land fraud cases was resumed
to-day Judge Pipes, for the defense,
objected to the introduction of certified
copies of the deeds on file in the office
of the County Clerk of Lynn County
showing a transfer of tha alleged bogus
homesteads to Mrs. Emma L. Watson.
Judge Pipes declared that a genuine
deed was the only instrument that
could be offered In a criminal proceed
ing as evidence of the fact that an act
had been committed, and that It could
not be done by the mere certification of
an officer.
Judge Bellinger ruled for the prosecu
tion, and the hope of the defense of
barring Introduction of deeds went
glimmering.

Funeral of Late R. D. Dnnphjr.
VALLEJO, Nov. 26. â The funeral
of the late naval veteran R. D. Dun
phy took place here to-day and was
largely attended. Only two of his
shipmates, who were with him on
the Hartford in the battle of Mobile
Bay in the Civil War, are on the Pa
cific Coast. They are Admiral Whit
ing at Goat Island and Captain J. F.
Tlnella of the Naval Veterans of Val
lejo. Admiral Whiting sent a beau
tiful floral piece.
"One thing is certain, however. A
stop should be put to this kind of
thing, and you may rest assured that
neither the boy's father nor myself In
tend to let this matter die a natural
death. Albert is still unable to walk
without assistance. Several times yes
terday he complained of pains along
the spine. He was feeling so badly to
day that he did not go to San Fran
cisco, and for that reason we have not
yet consulted the doctor regarding this
new phase of the cape."
"Whether or not these students will
be prosecuted for the hazing will rest
entirely with Albert's father, as he is
the one to take action against them.
My brother Is now in San Jose, but we
expect him to come to this city to-mor
row. Both the boy and myself have
written to him explaining the facts in
the case, but as yet have not been ad- #
vised as to what action Mr. de Rome'
intends to take. After he has seen and
talked with Albert and has had an In
terview with the doctor as to his eon's
Injuries ho will know what is to be
done in the matter, but, of course, I
am at present unable to tell .what his
action will be.

The school committee of the Insti

Ix>renzo P. Latimer, Henry Heyman,
M. Evelyn McCormick. George W.
Turner, John M. Gamble, Harry W.
Seawell, Newton J. Tharp and Mary
C. Brady, will meet to-morrow morn
ing to determine what punishment. If
any, shall be meted out to the ac
cused students. No formal com
plaint has been filed with the school
committee, but it is determined that the
fullest Investigation shall be had. If
the accused are found guilty of the
brutality charged they will be pun
ished, but in event they establish their
Innocence they will, of course, escape
the odium that attaches to the whoie
affair.
Louis de Rome was seen last evening
at his home in Oakland, where his
nephew, Albert de Rome, Is now stay
lng- ; pending the arrival of his father
from San Jose. When asked If war
lants would be secured for the ar
rest of the students concerned In the
hazing of his nephew, Mr. de Rome
said:
THE STUDENT JURY.
Last Friday Louis de Rome, uncle
of the lad that makes the charges of
brutality against his companions,
visited District Attorney Byington and
requested that criminal proceedings be
taken against the hazers. Byington
replied that his duty lay only in prose
cuting cases after complaint had been
duly lodged against the accused and
advised that If prosecution were de
sired warrants' for the hazers should
be sworn out. This is the last Bying
ton saw of De Rome, who swore out
no warrants on Friday nor did he ap
pear j-esterday in quest of any. In
consequence the authorities will not
move in the case unless some relative
of young De Rome takes the initiative.
The school committee of the Hop
kins Institute of Art will assemble to
morrow morning: to try the hazers of
young Albert de Rome. Though
threats of criminal prosecution and
civil suits were freely uttered by
friends and relatives of the youth, who
said he had been paralyzed from the
Â¦waist down -through the application to
his body of a powerful electric cur
rent, they have not as yet made a defi
nite move In this direction. As a re
sult the prosecution of the prank play
ers probably will be left to the school
committee.

All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
Is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
willow charcoal and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather In
the form of large, pleasant ta.<*fing
lozenges, the charcoal being mixed
with honey. .
The Gaily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, \ sweeter breath and purer
blood, arid the beauty of It is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, but on the contrary,
great benefit.
A Buffalo physic '-". in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gaa in stomach
and bowels, and â¢ to clear the com-
plexion and purify the breath, mouth
and throat: I also believe the liver Is
greatly benefited by the daily use of
them; they cost but , twenty-five cents
a box at drug stores, and. although
in some sense a patent preparation, yet
I believe I get more- and better char-
coal In Sfjart's Charcoal Lozenges
than In an- of the ordinary charcoal
tablets."
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it is not a
dru-; at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
tetth and further acts as a natural and
eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; It
disinfects ihe mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh..
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier In nature, but
few realize its value when taken Into
the human system Tor the same cleans-
ing- purpose. Â¦ -

NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â Among the
arrivals on the Baltic to-day was Mrs.
Marlon -'Kring. 'who with her nine chil
dren is on her way from Budapest to
California. Soon after leaving Queens
town she discovered that the ' 1600
kroner (about $315), which she had con
cealed in her dreVs, was missing. The
woman was 'in great distress as the
money had \ been sent by : her husband
in California to pay the passage of his
family across the continent.
News :of Mrs. Kring"s loss, reached
the passengers in the first cabin and a
subscription was started with the re
sult that $225 was raised ahd given ; the
woman. Her delight was so great that
soon the whole steerage knew about the
collection and then Mrs. Sylvia Ventell,'
who : had seven children with her, dis
covered' that she, 5 too, had lost money.
This story, too, reached the first cabin,'
but unfortunately for Mrs. Ventell the
subscribers; to the ; other fund ' got the
idea - that an; epidemic of robbery was
on the ; point ot breaking \ out in the
steerage and were loth to encourage it.
Fund Raised for Woman With Nine
Children on Her Way to
California.
..The chief executive was . Â¦. evidently
pleased by the allusions to California's
majority. 'The Sacramento and Los
Angeles exhibits were decorated with
portraits of the President and banners.
Charles Wyer of- the Fresno exhibit
sent to the President's car a collection
of -raisins,, oranges, olives and; nuts
from - his county. Henry Ellis .. sent
aJmonds from. San' Joaquln.- . r
another after visiting his old cabin,
brought from North Dakota.
The President went through rapidly
and during his trip faced the Central
California and some of the Southern
California exhibits. His only com
ment as he hurried along was as he
passed the Kings County display.
Glancing at it hurriedly, he exclaimed:
"Fine,, very ' fine!" Perhaps his J re
mark was brought out by Captain Will
Harris, manager of the exhibit, who
shouted as the President passed: "Cali
fornia,; 120,000!" .

To-night the ; President was the
guest of honor at a banquet tendered
in the grounds by the exposition man
agement.
ery Hall the visitors were hurried into
the electricity building, from the ve
randa of which they viewed the spe
cial pyrotechnic display on Festival
Hill and the illumination of the cas
cades with red fire. This closed the
day's programme and the President.'
Mrs. Roosevelt and . Miss Alice were
driven to the residence of. Mr. Thom
ason, treasurer of the exposition,
whose guests they are during their
stay in St. Louis.
I "I see now how much good Secretary
â¢ Taft did in the Philippines. I will
make an effort to have your battalion
I attend the inaugural in Washington."
i Major Johnston thanked the Presi
i dent warmly, assuring him that all
the scouts would be glad to attend, as
they had seen a little of America and
desired to see more. The visitors
then entered carriages and were driv
en to Machinery Hall. From Machin-
'Yes, I know," said the President
"You have Secretary of War Taf t to
thanks, as we are all his proteges,"
quickly replied Major Johnston, smil
ing. . /
Just as the party was crossing the
bridge of Spain over the moat before
the walled city in leaving the' Philip
pines Exposition, President Roosevelt
suddenly halted In the middle of the
bridge and said to Major William H.
Johnston, commandant of the Philip
pines scouts:
"I want to congratulate you upon
the remarkably clean and effective
drill of your battalion, which was very
fine and very impressive."
With Mrs. Roosevelt and Miss Alice
tagging at his side the President hur
ried from place to place, stopping only
long enough to get a general idea of
the exhibits, applauding the constabu
lary drill and expressing his pleasure
at all he saw.

presented and the President spoke
briefly in accepting.
The rest of the day was spent in the
Philippine reservation. Guards had
cleared the area of visitors and the en
tire place was given over to Inspection
by the Presidential party.
In the Visayan village the Presi
dent was enfertalned in the native
theater by singing and dancing. In
the Ba^abo village a silver dish was
The ruests were on their feet instant
ly and merrily clinked glasses as they
drank to Mrs. Roosevelt, who, smiling,
bowed her appreciation.
A hurried visit was then made to the
American building and thence to the
Roosevelt cabin, which sheltered the
President in former days on the ranch.
He evinced the greatest Interest in the
old log structure and pointed out to
Mrs. Roosevelt and Miss Alice a buf
falo skin hanging within as having
come from the first buffalo he had ever
killed.
Champagne was Eipped in honor of
the toast, and then the party hurried
to the other national pavilions, com
pleting the inspection soon after mid
day, and luncheon was served in the
West pavilion. This occupied about an
hour and was purely informal. At the
conclusion President Francis arose,
end. holding up a glass of champagne,
Â¦aid:
"I desire to offer a toast that will
not receive a favorable response be
cause we are simply resting and sight
seeing and are not devoting ourselves
to speeches. I desire that this toast
be drunk standing in honor of one who
exerts a very potential influence over
the policy and the destiny of this coun
tryâthe lady who presides over the
White House."
VISITS OTHER PAVILIONS.
From 10 in the forenoon until 6 in the
evening, following an arranged sched
ule, the party hurried from one build
ing to the next, from one part of the
grounds to another, and overlooked
nothing of interest. From the start to
the end of the tour Mrs. Roosevelt and
Miss Alice accompanied the President
and fatigue was forgotten in the enjoy-
V.ient of the day.
The first speech of the day was made
in the French pavilion in response to
the welcome accorded by Commissioner
General Gerald. President Roosevelt
raid:
"Mr. Commissioner: I wish to thank
you from my heart for the kind words
that you have just spoken. At this ex
position the great republic of France
has a peculiarly appropriate part, the
great nation Â¦whose people worked so
much in the past for the discovery and
settlement of this continent and the
people that took this infant nation by
the hand to help it up into the circle of
powers. One of your publicists has
used the expression, the 'peace of jus
tice.' and I am particularly pleased as
to what you say as to the efforts of the
committee to bring about throughout
the world the 'peace of Justice.'
"I wish to propose a toast to Presi
dent Loubet and to the French nation,
end may the bonds of friendship that
have ever united them with the United
Staffs of America be even tightened
in the future." - ,:Â¦
"This is marvelous," said the Presi
dent. "It is beyond description and ex
reeds my fondest expectations. I have
had the best time I have ever had in
my life and I have seen more than I
ever expected to see in one day's time."
the opening of the World's Fair than
those that marked to-day, which was
devoted to a tour through the exposi
tion by President Roosevelt, accompa
ried by Mrs. Roosevelt, Miss Alice
Roosevelt and members of the Presi
dent's party. It was strictly a day of
pleasure and not the slightest Incident
occurred to mar the perfect enjoyment
of the occasion. The heralded an
nouncement that the nation's chief ex
ecutive would visit the exposition drew
tremendous throngs, and to guard him
from possible danger that might men
ace him secret service men, soldiers and
r^lice guards abounded, but they had
comparatively little to do in preserving

Promoter F. E. Pettingill of New
York, who would have the great Amer
ican public believe that he is on the eve
of building a railroad from San Fran
cisco to Denver by way of Monterey
and Pioche, Nev., has come to grief in
this city. Yesterday the doors of his
rooms at the St. Francis Hotel, which
he had occupied for several weeks, were
locked against him, and later in the
day he was hustling about the Palace
Hotel corridors trying to find some one
who. would go good for his room at that
hostelry over the Sabbath.
Pettingill's short stay at'the St. Fran
cis "cost that establishment J500, and
when the management finally realized
that its chances for remuneration were
daily growing smaller it quietly re
moved his effects to the basement and
tightly locked the doors of the pro
moter's apartments, so that he could
not even enter them and enjoy the
privilege of a wash. When his room ac
count first became delinquent and he
was pressed for a settlement Pettingill
said that Millionaire A. H. Butler of
New York, who was backing him ih the
railroad enterprise, was on his way to
San . Francisco and would soon make
money plentiful. A week passed, and
another appeal from the St Francis
management brought the same re
sponse, "Butler is "coming." But Butler
didn't come and Pettingill had to go.
About a year ago Pettingill, who is
well known in the East, was "arrested
in Denver, where It was charged that
he was 'using the names of prominent
men, among them Millionaire David
Moffatt of that city, to promote one of
his projects.

"To the Sheriff of Auburn, CaKâ I be
lieve that Weber bought that pistol at
the Emporium, San Francisco. They
sell them there, and when Weber was
in San Francisco last June he stopped
on Eddy street, only a short distance
away. If he is also the bank robber the
money is under the barn. Weber's ac
tions, habits and demeanor are not.un
like those of Guiteau, who shot Gar
field."
Sheriff Keena is still in San Francisco
endeavoring to learn if any one sold
young Weber a oietol. A rumor was
current to-day that the pistol was sold
In Auburn. The officers are certain the
cartridges were bought here.
Weber was feeling better to-day, and
for dinner ate some baked heart and
boiled eggs. He drank cocoa, and re
marked to Under Sheriff May that he
was as hungry as a wolf. Among the
many letters received at the Sheriff's
office daily came one from Modesto to
day. It is simply signed "A Citizen"
and reads as fallows:
"MODESTO, Nov. 24, 1904.
Attorney Tabor returned this "after
noon from San Francisco. It is under
stood that he went there to engage spe
cial counsel for the defense. Weber
wants Attorney Delmas, while Tabor
wants Hiram Johnson.
s Attorney Ben Tabor's statement that
there is insanity on the Weber side of
the family would indicate that the de
fendant's plea will be insanity. Tabor
says that two uncles of the prisoner
who are living in Germany are insane.
AUBURN, Nov. 26.â Developments
â¢were few in the Weber case to-day. The
prisoner while being shaved this morn
ing asked the barber what the people
thought about the case, particularly
about the finding of the pistol. He also
was anxious to know if they believed
Miss May Clark's story about the route
he toqk. It will be remembered that
Miss Clark testified that she saw Weber
pass her house in Brewery lane, while
Weber says he went another route.

What Sulphur Does
For the Human Body In Health and
Disease.
The mention of sulphur will recall to
many of us the early days when our
mothers and grandmothers gave us our
daily dose of sulphur and molasses
every spring and fall.
It was the universal spring: and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all,
and, mind you, this old-fashioned rem-
edy was not wittibut merit.
The idea was good, but the remedy
was crude and unpalatable, and a large
quantity had to be taken to get any
effect.
Nowadays we get all the beneficial
effects of sulphur in a palatable, con-
centrated form, so tjiat a single grain
Is far more effective than a tablespoon-
ful of the crude sulphur.
In recent years, research and experi-
ment have proven that the best sulphur
for medicinal use is that obtained from
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold
In drug stores under the name of
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. They are
small chocolate coated pellets and con-
tain the active medicinal principle of
sulphur in a highly concentrated, ef-
fective form. ..-;Â¦. /
Few people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur In restoring and
maintaining bodily vigor and health:
sulphur acts directly on the liver, and
excretory organs and purifies and en-
riches the blood by the prompt elimina-
tion of waste material.
Our grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and molas-
ses every spring and fall, but the cru-
dity and impurity of ordinary flowers
of sulphur were often worse than the
disease, and cannot compare with the
modern concentrated preparations of
sulphur, of which Stuart's. Calcium
Wafers is undoubtedly the best and
most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for
liver and kidney troubles and cure con-
stipation and purify the blood in a way
that often surprises patient and physi-
cian alike.
Dr. R. M. Wilklns while experiment-
ing with sulphur remedies soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was su-
perior to any other form. \He, says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles,
especially when resulting from consti-
pation or 'malaria, I have been . sur-
prised at the results obtained from
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. In patients
suffering from boils and pimples "and
even deep-seated carbuncles, I have re-
peatedly seen them dry up and disap-
pear, in four or five days, leaving the
skin ' clear and Â¦ smooth. : Although
Stuart's Calcium Wafers is a proprie-
tary article, and sold by druggists, and
for that reason tabooed by many physi-
cians, yet I know ./of nothing so safe
and reliable for constipation, liver and
kidney troubles . and especially, ; in all
forms of , skin , disease as . this \ remedy."
At any rate .< people * who Â¦ are tired , of
pills, cathartics and so-called blood
"purifiers," will : find , in ; Stuart's Cal-
cium Wafers*. a : far safer, more . palat-
able and effective preparation.

NEW YORK. Nov. 26. â The illness
of a juror caused a sudden and un
expected adjournment in the Patter
son murder trial, which was to have
been continued in the criminal branch
of the Supreme Court to-day after the
Thanksgiving holiday recess. When
everything was in readiness to pro
ceed it was announced that Juror Ed
ward Dressier was too ill to leave his
home. There remained no ' alterna
tive but to suspend the trial for the
time being and an adjournment was
ordered by Justice Davis.
Miss Patterson was in court when
the adjournment was announced. She
expressed keen disappointment at the
sudden interruption in the trial.
"I suppose this will mean a new
trial," she said as she was being led
back to her cell in the Tombs. "I
am sorry the juror is* ill, both for his
sake and for my own. I was sure the
jury would acquit me. If there must
be a new trial I hope it will come at
once." v;_.
One of the stories which gained
wide circulation to-day and which, if
true, undoubtedly would have added
materially to the sensational side of
the trial, was to the effect that J.
Morgan Smith, Nan Patterson's broth
er-in-law, who fled after he had been
subpenaed to appear before the Grand
Jury, had been found and was locked
up at police headquarters. This re
port was later denied by the police,
however.
The prosecution has kept up an un
remitting search for Smith ever since
he disappeared. They charge that it
was Smith who purchased the re
volver with which* Toun^ "was shot
and that he would prove to be 'their
strongest witness if he could be found.
Already Smith's photograph has been
introduced in the case and identified
and the prosecution has promised that
the pawnbroker who sold the revolver
will also identify the photograph as
that of the man who purchased the
weapon.
, All the testimony thus far produced
has been leading up to what . the
prosecution declares was the motive
for the crime, and with . the begin

"San Francisco," he said, "supplied
Nicaragua with large quantities of gro
ceries and also much dried and canned
fruit, though the country produces good
fruit itself. Some coffee trade may be
diverted through Bluefields when the
railroad is completed, but I think San
Francisco's grocery trade will grow In
stead of diminish.
"The coffee trade is assuming tre
mendous importance and Is the main
trade factor In Central and much of
South America. Even if the business
of distributing our coffee in the East is
taken away from San Francisco, her
business in that line will grow, for her
own territory is growing rapidly."
All these Latin American people,
from Mexico to Argentina, love San
Francisco. Some of the coffe,e trade
may be diverted and some California
flour may be superseded by Eastern
goods, but never will theee people cease
to look with fondness on the city by
the Golden Gate. It is like Paris to
them, with all its attractions and
pleasures. Nearly every one of them
who has traveled at all has visited San
Francisco, and' their eyes . dance- in
memory of It. From them, there is nev
er a word of anything but ; praise for
the California metropolis.' The Latin
American gold will ever pour into the
coffers of the San Francisco hotel,- cafe
and theater, and with the people so
favorably inclined trade is certain to
swell to vast proportions as the years
go by. even if a few railroads do bring"
something nearer that; devouring com
mercial maw of the East.
TRADE WILL INCREASE.
Opinions differ, however. Nicaragua
is going to be traversed by a railroad
that will reach the salt water on each
Bide of It and its commissioner doesn't
apprehend any danger to San. Fran
cisco from the completion of this xoad.
of which historic Bluefields, said ' to
be climbing fast toward cltydom, will
be the eastern terminus. Senor Juan
J. Zelaya is president of the Nicara
guan commission, but he sp'eaks little
English and his secretary. L. V. Navar
ro, who Is a Mexican, and who served
his country as Consul at Tucson, Ari
zona, for eight years, speaks for him.
Senor Navarro couldn't see that San
Francisco was to be damaged materi
ally by the railroad across Nicaragua.
Well, if San Francisco should lose
Guatemala it will gain Brazil when
the canal is finished, so all hope is
not lost.V/
Francisco will be that of the distribu
tion of Guatemalan coffee. It is now
the place from which our coffee is sent
throughout the United States. When
the railroad connects Barrios with the
Pacific Coast all this coffee, save that
used in the coast States, will be dis
tributed from New York, Chicago and
St. Louis."

BIG GUATEMALAN TRADE.
"San Francisco now sends annually
to Guatemala nearly $2,000,000 worth of
goods.", said Senor Irigoyen. "The prin
cipal item is flour, but there are also
lumber, agricultural Implements and
miscellaneous exports. It is only 220
miles from San Jose on the Pacific to
Barrios on the other side, and from the
latter place to New Orleans is only 850
miles. The railroad will be completed
within a year, but in four or five
months It will reach a point from which
wagon freighting will be possible to the
section running down from Mexico and
even then San Francisco's trade will
begin to suffer.
"Another loss that will come to San
that now sound the Horn on their way
from Europe to the Orient usually put
into Rio Janeiro; when the canal is
completed they will go- straight
through."
Carlos F. Irigoyen, commissioner gen
eral from Guatemala, is well known in
San Francisco, having. been in the em
ploy of a large importing house there
for eight years. He doesn't speak en
couragingly of the future of San Fran
cisco's trade with his country. In fact,
he expresses a fear that the merchants
of the California metropolis will lose
nearly all of it unless they take the one
step that he thinks will retain it, cheap
er ocean freight rates.. He says that rail
connection between San Jose and Port
Barrios is going to give to the East all
the trade now held by San Francisco
unless steamship freight rates are low
ered.
"I am afraid my country is going to

products to England and Europe, and
Bra7il may take many of them. San
Franci5co may develop a good trade

is going: to be an important commer

Frareiseo when the canal is com
p!ft*d.
"Easier access may also create a
market in Brazil for many California
products. We can grow most any
kind of fruit in Brazil, but California

quantities that she can force the de-
BENEFITED BY CAXAI*.
"Outside of the large harvesting ma
chinery California and San Francisco
send but few things to Brazil," said
Colonel F. M. Souza, president of the
Brazil commission, "and that portion
cf our co?TÂ«-e that is distributed from
San Francisco goes there from New
Orleans or New York. When the Pan
ama canal is completed greater quan
tities of our corfee will be sent to San
Francisco, for it will be easier to send
it thera than to New York on the
stormy Atlantic. Territory now sup
plied by New York should then get
its Brazilian coffee from San Fran
cisco, which will become the main
distributir.sr point for it in America
and the trade will be an important
one.
"There is ons thin* the Mexican de

So said Seaor Albino R. Nuncio, Com
missioner General from the republic of
Mexico to the St. Louis Exposition. He
wa* talking of the trade relations of
San Francisco and his country.
"At present," continued Commission
er Nuncio, "Mexico imports large
Quantities of dried and canned fruits
and raisins from Epain. These are no
better than, and. in many cases, not as
pood as those to be had ln California.
The obstacle that hinders the placing
of goods from San Francisco is the pre
ponderance cf storekeepers who are
Spanish. The percentage of American
storekeepers is very small. The latter
use California dried and canned fruits
a.nd raisins, wtiile the Spanish dealers
import from Spain. I think the Cali
fornia people could g;et more of this
trade if they were to go after it right.
It will be of great value until Mexico
produces all the fruit she consumes and
of course we hope to see her do that
some day.

To-day is a good day to rest and do
a little thinking on the serious prob-
lem of life.
If you are a drinking man stop and
figure out how much you arc spend-
ing a year for whisky and beer. Think
if you stopped drinking how many
more comforts and pleasures" your
family could have.. Think what you
might be able to do for your children.
Why not stop drinking? But you
say, "I've tried and can't." You
haven't really tried if you haven't
come to me. In three days I can kril
all desire for further drinking. After
taking my treatment your general
health will be better than since you
were a boy." I have treated success-
fully over 15,000 men. Write me to-
day or call at your first opportunity.

URICSOL CHEMICAL CO.
Los Angeles, CaL
Every San Francisco druggist sells
Uricsol, the well-known remedy, and
we hereby authorize them to guaran-
tee a* cure.
Uri^sol cures rheumatism in the only
possible way it can be cured.
Uric Acid and Urates are the cause
of 'Rheumatism. These are deposited
in the tissues, blood vessels and joints
of the body.
These deposits must be dissolved
and eliminated . from the system ;â¢, be-
fore a cure can be^ accomplished.
Uricsol is a solvent of these and
tones up the ? system, stimulates the
kidneys, liver ..nd bowels and thus
drives them Â¦ from the system.
.Uricsol is' harmless, and no . injuri-
ous, results can possibly come " to any
part of your body.
-Write 'us. to-day for, booklet con-
taining ' recommended .diet for rheu-
matics. ..." -.-Â¦-Â¦ > : -. ..v' Â¦;-Â¦ V- :
If you ere suffering from rheuma-
tism there is a chance for you "to be-
come absolutely cured. You may
cure yourself and do it quickly if you
will lay aside your prejudice and
skepticism. â¢"^
Uricsol,
the only cvre for
Rheumatism.

A cablegrram was received yesterday
from Mazatlan announcing .that the
Pacific Mail liner City of Panama had
been sighted off the Mexican port
towing a four-masted vessel, supposed
to be the .barkentlne Makaweli. If the
City of Panama really has a four
masted vessel in tow the supposition
may be correct, but it Is more likely
that what was seen trailing behind the
liner was the - little tug Alexander
Volta, with which the Panama left
this port. . r
The Makaweli- was bound from Pu
get Sound to Mazatlan with a cargo"
of coaL A 1 , life buoy marked "Maka
weli" and some wreckage found on
the coast of Vancouver Island gave
rise to a fear; that. the barkentlne had
been lost. . Although not accepting the
wreckage as evidence of the vessel's
destruction. Hind, Rolph & . Co.", the
owners, have been anxious for some
report to back their belief In her safe
ty. They hope now to hear within a
few hours that ' the Makaweli Is safe
at Mazatlan.
May! Be the Makawell.

Works. 37 to 47 Central wharf, when the
directors, heads of departments and em

successful year of kindly fellow-feeling
and harmonious working together. Mr
Thomas Dollber, president and treasurer
of the company, read the Thanksgiving
proclamation of the President of the
United States and that of the Governor
of Massachusetts; then, on behalf of the
directors, he expressed his appreciation
of the employes' work during the past
twelve months. He said that the increase
in the business had been large and even
beyond the expectation of the most san

and that he was much gratified with the
results attained. He thanked all for
their hearty co-operation In producing
these results.

A description of the state gown worn
by the Lady Mayoress on this occa
sion, th? crowning triumph of her here
tofore uneventful life, may interest
feminine readers. It is made of ame
thyst chiffon velvet and soft liberty
satin of a paler shade. The ornamenta
tion !s carried out in silk embroidery
Btudded with re&rl beads and caba
chons. with occasional appliques of vel
vet of a darker shde in, the form of
pomegranates. Lastly, there are deep
frills and a narrow berthe of exquisite
pearly white real lace, which forms the
lower part of the sleeves and the
flounce on the skirt- peeping out .be-'
tween the embroidered battlements. It
Is mounted on kilted- white chiffon
which Accentuates the^ beauty of the
design.
The Lady Mayoress presides over a
court of her own which Is quite as
punctilious 'and ceremonial as that
which attaches to royalty itself. She
holds frequent receptions in the grand
salon of the official residence. Here,
with her maids of . honor grouped
around her. she seats herself In one
of the gold and crimson chairs of state
facing the grand staircase. Stately
footmen with Immaculate calves and
powdered hair announce the names of
the visitors as they ascend the stair
case to pay her homage. Liberal re-
As the "Lady Mayoress" she will
share in all ot her husband's tre
mendous dignities. Just as within the
confines of the square mile known as
the "city" he will take precedence of
all mankind save only his sovereign, so
she will take precedence of all woman
kind save only the Queen. She is an
elderly womanâ her husband is 65â but
It may be safely assumed that the van
ities of this world still possess sufii
cient attractions for her to make her
hugely enjoy the spectacle of titled
damesâ who might have turned up
their aristocratic noses at her when she
was merely a rich tradesman's wife â
making obeisances before her, and oc
cupying back seats while Â«ehe hobnobs
with royalty and notables at Mansion
House state functions. If there should
chance to be an American duchess or
two around at the time all the keener
will be her triumph.
The Lady Mayoress makes her debut
In her new role at the great banquet
held in the Lord Mayor's official resl
denc-, the Mansion House, at which he
celebrates his accession to the civic
throne. She does It In great style, too.
The general company to the number of
several hundreds, having taken their

oress, usually on the arm of the Prime
Minister, her train borne by a page,
and with six maids of honor In her
wake. Being attended by maids of
honor Is one of the privileges she
shares with roj'alty. She selects them
herself and Incidentally she has to pro
vide them with dresses, one of the
many expensive items attaching to the
Lord Mayor's office which makes It in
cumbent on him to spend twice or
thrice as much as the salary of $50,000
he draws from the city exchequer.
; A GORGEOUS GOWX.
LONDON, Nov. 26.â Recently Mrs.
John Poundâ whose husband, the
wealthy trunk manufacturer, was re
cently Lord Mayor â became the first
lady of London.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Considering her previous training one
would think that Mrs. Pound will be
considerably flustered at times to know
Just what she should do and how she
should do it. But all she really has
to do is to put herself unreservedly in
the hands of the permanent attendants
at the Mansion House, who have coach
ed her predecessors, and they will see
that she gets through without making
any noticeably bad breaks. And when
she leaves the Mansion House at the
expiration of her husband's term of
ofHce it will not be to return to the
comparative social obscurity of a pros
perous tradesman's wife. He Is sure
to be knighted and she will be "her
Ladyship" for the rest of her days and
as such she will have the entree to
the charmed circle cf those who "toll
not, neither do they spin."
Going through fussy ceremonies in
antique fashion and dispensing lavish
hospitality constitute the chief func
tions of Lord Mayors in these days,
and in helping carry out the latter part
of the official programme the Lady
Mayoress has to bear her part. Seldom
a day passes that there are not lunch
eon parties, large or small, at the Man
sion House, and big dinners are nu
merous. Grand balls, too, are consid
ered a necessary accompaniment of the
municipal government of the city.
Mc-narchs and other exalted foreign
visitors are almost Invariably banquet
ed at the Mansion House. For the
coveted honor of entertaining a real
live King Mrs. John Pound will not have
to wait long. It will be one cf her
privileges as Lady Mayoress to be pre
sented to the first royal court that Is
held after the Lord Mayor's banquet.
She cannot go driving with her bus
band in the cumbersome old $50,000
state coach â that is for the Lord Mayor
alone on state occasions, when he puts
on all the dignity of his office â but
there is another much more comfortable
If less gorgeous civic coach which she
shares with him when they Jointly vis
it bazaars and other charitable affairs
which they honor with their distin
guished patronage,
freshments are, of course, provided and
professional musicians are hired to fur
nish music, which in a measure may
account for the fact that ; frequently
as many as five hundred people at
tend these receptions.

HONOLULU, Nov. 19.â There* is a
weird story from the island of Maui.
Living at Hana is a native family
named Kilinahe. The family was
quite well to do until a short time ago,
when the elder member of the 'family
dreamed that his dead child appeared
and told him that, on November 28, a
floating island would appear at Hana
fcr them and they must be ready to
leave their homes and go on the floating
island. The child announced that he
would be on a rainbow which would
connect the Hana point with the island.
He would guide them along the rain
bow, to the Sew land.
So impressed was the elder Kilinahe
with the story that lie told his family,
and all agreed to prepare for the ar
rival of the island. The family has been
disposing of their property ever since
and the family home has" been turned
into a church. The bones of the child
were disinterred, for according to the
dream the child would come to life
again and meet the family when the
island came. After getting'on the island
all the family will float away Into the
sea and live In peace and plenty. A
number of other natives in the Hana
neighborhood are trying to sell out In
order to get stock In the new colony.
Kanehunamoku is the name of the isl
lan d.

One hundred and. sixty-six of the
Japanese brought from the Orient in
the steerage of the liner Korea were
transferred yesterday to the steamship
Peru, which sailed at noon for Pana
ma and" way ports. 'The. Japanese are
going to Salina Cruz under contract
to work on the -Mexican railroad. The
little brown section hands objected to
the transfer and for a while put up
a lively resistance. They had been
told, they said, that the journey 4 from
here to Salina Cruz would be by rail.
They were all subject to seasickness
and every Jap of them vowed he had
no stomach for a further taste of life
on the bounding billow.
"We will make honorable resistance
to the violent demands of our base de
ceivers" was the ultimatum issued from
the Korea's steerage.
"I'll fix "em," said a doughty com
pany official. 'Til Just yank one of
them along and the others will follow
like sheep."
The official selected a fair sized
brown man for the experiment. He
grabbed at the Jap. Nobody knows
Just what followed, but when the dust
cieared the official was sitting on the
deck watching with* bewildered interest
the smiling face of the man he had,In
tended to "yank." \**-\
The official made his report to the
company's office a few minutes later.
His message ran: " 'Diplomatism' will
have to be used to move them Japs.
That 'Jew gypsum* Is too much for
me."
"Diplomatism" prevailed and the
transfer was accomplished without fur
ther trouble.
The Peru carried a full cargo and
about a score of cabin passengers.

OAKLAND, Nov. 26.â The glow of, the
Christmas tree is beginning to spread
out and envelop us, and the streets are
thronged with busy shoppers who wear
that little smile of happy mystery that
seems at this time of year to creep un
consciously into every face. It is the
season when one makes a perfect ex
press wagon of oneself without a mur
mur â when one Is expected to cough
ostentatiously or to rattle the doorknob
before invading the family circle, where
some wonderful Christmas present may
be in course of evolution. In fact, the
"Christmasy" feeling is getting into
our veins, and social gatherings every
where, great and small, are the more
enjoyable because of it. Perhaps that
is why there seems to be no cessatlo'n
in the round of teas, card parties and
the like that has made the season so
far an unusually brilliant one.
The Board of Health was directed
to stop garbage men from picking over
garbage on public streets.
A. Sbarboro favored the collecting
of garbage at night, as is Gone in large
Eastern cities. Health Officer D. F.
Ragan gave an interesting account of
his Eastern trip and the result of his
investigations into the methods adopt
ed by Eastern cities along sanitary
lines and pure food analysis.
The Board of Health was asked to
recommend to the Supervisors that
they pass an ordinance to stop young
women in glove, stores from using
saliva on their fingers to aid them in
fitting gloves to the hand. Dr. Regens
burger, president of the State Board
of Health, is of the opinion that this
is dangerous and suggests that all
stores be compelled to furnish sponges
to Jheir help, so that they will not
moisten their finger tips with their
tongues and thus carry disease.
At a meeting of the Public Health
Commission of California yesterday it
was decided to ask the Supervisors to
set aside $1500 more to continue the
work of cleaning Chinatown until the
end of December. This sum, it was ex
plained to Supervisors Brandenstein
and D'Ancona, who were present, is to
be used in paying the wages 'of the
wrecking crew and for buying, disin
fectants. Ever since the discovery of
disease in the Celestial quarter the
Board of Health of this city, in con
junction wltVi the Federal Government
and the State Board of Health, has
labored diligently to make the Chi
nese quarter sanitary. The United
States authorities have a corps of doc
tors examining deceased Chinese with
a view to discovering whether they
were suffering from a dread disease.
Dr. Blue is of ths opinion that the
cementing of basements has brought
about a decrease In Chinatown's mor
tality. In 1902 471 Chinese died and
in 1903 the death rate was 365.
Deputy Health Officer Levy will ap
pear before the Finance Committee
of the Board of Supervisors to-morrow
and show what work was done In
Chinatown and how the money was
expended. Drs. Blue, Ragan and
Hassler will also be present to urge
the setting aside of more money to
continue the work.

OAKLAND, Nov. 26.â Death rode on
the seat with W. S. Kennedy this morn
ing when suddenly he was thrown off
and under the wheels of his wagon,
which crushed in his head. â¢ In his
pocket he had a letter from his little
daughter, who was planning fir
Christmas and wished to know what
her papa wanted her to make for him.
Kennedy's body was taken to the Re

aid of the physician when he arrived
there and soon died. His body was
taken to the Morgue.
The letter apparently pleased the old
man, for it was the only thing he had
in his pocket and read as follows:

Impressive ceremonies marked the
funeral of Frank J. Moffltt, which was
held this morning at 9 o'clock from
the family residence, 1337 Filbert
street. After the service at the home
of the deceased the remains were re
moved to St. Frances de Sales Church,
where a solemn requiem mass was
celebrated by the Rev. Father
Baschab, assisted by the Rev. Father
Yorke as deacon, the Rev. Father Mc-
Hugh as sub-deacon and the Rev.
Father Cantwell as master of cere
monies. The other clergymen present
were: Father J. B. McNally of Oak
land, Father Foley of Alameda and
Father C. E. O'Neile of San Francisco.
"Wllcox's Requiem Mass" was sung by
a quartet, composed of Mrs. Grace
Carroll Elliott, Mrs. Cora Hall, Oscar
Lienan and J. S. Sandy. Mrs. W. E.
Dargie sang Leybach's "Pie Jesu."
The casket was covered with a pall
of violets and hidden beneath a mass
of floral offerings sent -by friends of
the deceased. At the close of the mass
the Rev. Father J. B. McNally, pastor
of St. Patrick's Church, preached an
eloquent sermon. In part he spoke as
follows:
"Frank Moffltt was a man who did
his duty in'society and family, who ful
filled his obligations and performed
many acts of merit, and therefore we,
knowing his good qualities and his fine,
generous SDirit, should look forward to
God not to lose sight of that man.
"Every one who knew Frank J. Mof
fitt knew how intense he was in all
things that he took to heart â his love
for his wife and child and relatives, his
ardent zeal to edify by his life in the
faith those whom by his neglect he
may have disedified in the past. He died
surrounded by his family and relatives
and with a priest kneeling at his bed
side. We loved him in life; let us not
forget him in death. Never cease to
pray that God may have. mercy on his
soul."

about 60 years of age and looked the

IN NATIONAL GUARD
Statement Reveals Important Changes
Due to Speculation and the Ex
portation of Gold.
NEW YORK. Nov. 26.â The Finan
cier says: ThÂ» official statement of the
New York Associated Bank3 last week
showed, as the most striking changes
compared with the previous week, an
important decrease in loans, though
somewhat smaller than was expected,
a loss of cash closely corresponding
with that which was indicated by the
estimates that were based upon the
known movements of money; a de
crease in deposits by an amount very
nearly agreeing with the sum of the re
duction in loans and the loss of cash,
and a decrease In the surplus reserve
to a little more than $1,000,000 below
the amount at the beginning of the.
year.
The loan contraction was 510,289,800,'
making $39,763,700 since October 29. in
which period there has been a buoyant
speculation in the stock market, calling
logically for expansion rather than
contraction. It is quite likely, however,
that the trust companies are carrying
a larger volume of loans.
Loss of cash was $3,124,600 net, or
$1,OS2,500 less than the estimate, but the
discrepancy was doubtless due to the
system of bank averages and also to
the inclusion In the estimates of tho
withdrawals of gold for export which
occurred on the last day of the previous
bank week and were then accounted
for in the statement. The loss of cash
reported by the banks makes a total
since October 29 of $23,467,700. The de
posits were decreased last week by
$15,665,100, making $60,221,700 since the
above mentioned date. Computed upon
the* basis of deposits, less those of $25,-
S73.30O public funds, the surplus Is
$14,224,525. The surplus against general
deposits a year ago was, it may be
noted, $6.12.-.20O.

Grand Jury Passes Resolution Recom
mending Amendment to the
Charter.
A resolution introduced by Milton H.
Esberg was passed by the Grand Jury
Friday night recommending that the
charter be amended so as to provide for
the selection of the Police Commission
ers by the twelve Judges of the Su
perior Court Instead of appointment by
the Mayor and to make the tenure of
office for life or during good behavior.
There was spirited opposition to the
resolution, but it was carried by a
large majority.
The- charter at present prescribes a
tenure of four years for the Police
Commissioners, and the plan the Grand
Jury proposes was that followed before
the charter was adopted. '
The jurors had a protracted wrangle
over a resolution to indorse the admin
istration of Assessor Dodge. It was
finally adopted by a vote of 9 to 7.
Reports were received from various
sub-committees in preparation for the
disbanding of the Grand Jury, which
is to take place as soon as it can
wind ud its business. The examination
of the books of the Treasurer and Aud
itor reveals the fact that it is Impos
sible to follow the provisions of the
charter in the expenditure of munici
pal funds and many violations of the
law were found.

The Josselyn family has taken the
Dolbeer house at 2112 Pacific avenue
for the winter. When Miss Warren,
to whom the handsome residence waa
bequeathed, returned from New York
she went there to live. But sh-Â» later
took apartments on Van Ness avenue,
where she expects to remain until the
contest of her legacies is concluded.
Meantime the executors of the -istaf?
decided that the house should not re
main vacant and it was rented to the
Josselyns.
The attorneys for the proponents' of
the will . have notified Johnson &
Johnson that they elect to have the
deposition of Alfred Armand taken by
oral interrogatories. The motion for
a commission to issue will be made
to-morrow.
The cross-examination of Miss Jos
selyn will be continued when the
trial Is resumed to-morrow morning
in Judge Coffey's court. She will
probably be followed on the stand by
her mother. Mrs. CM. Josselyn. In
addition to the society belles and ma
trons who will be called several prom
inent men who were friends of Miss
Dolbeer are to testify. Former Mayor
James D. Phelan is one.
The proponents have made a deter
mined effort to get the depositions of
the Misses O'Connor of this city, who
are now touring Europe, but it has been
impossible thus far to arrange for the
taking of their testimony, for they are
traveling about the Continent and mak
ing no prolonged stay at any point. The
Misses O'Connor, who are five in num
ber; were intimate friends of Miss Dol
beer, but their testimony is particular
ly desired because they were with her
during her sojourn In Paris the last few
weeks of her life. They participated in
"the battle of flowers" -in June, which
fete Mias Dolbeer attended in the com
pany of MisÂ« Mary Josselyn of this
city.
The proponents In the Dolbeer will
contest have decided to curtail " their
case somewhat. Many of the witnesses
who were subpenaed to testify as to
the sanity of the testatrix will not be
called to the Etand. for it is believed
that without them the fact of her
healthy mental condition will be suffi
ciently established by preponderance of
evidence. There is also such a thing as
wearying the jurors with the accounts
of Miss Dolbeer's social activities and
sane enjoyment of life during the year
that preceded her death, this being the
point of the testimony for which so
many witnesses were summoned.
While the attorneys have come to the
conclusion that the trial can safely be
shortened, they have yet much evi
dence to produce, and owing to the un
certainty of the length of cross-exam
inations no one will venture a predic
tion as to when the case will go to the
jury. There are several more of Miss
Dolbeer's social friends to testify_ that
they noticed no signs of insanity at any
time, in refutation of the statements
of Mrs. J. L. Moody and -oxs. Elizabeth
C. Phillips to the contrary. Among

The Papyrus Club Quartet sang with
good effect, receiving much congratu
lation. Amon Cain also sang barytone
solos, receiving much praise.
Th*e afternoon, between converse and
music, was one to long be remembered
by those as guests and hostesses.
The Papyrus \ Club presented a bril
liant and attractive appearance yester
day afternoon on the occasion of its
reception to three notable women.
Elks' Hall was filled and many lin
gered later than convention demanded,
for the affair was one so thoroughly
friendly and entirely divested of the
perfunctory spirit.
The Misses Withrow were widely and
heartily claimed, friends of old pressed
hard to greet and bid welcome home â
new friends to offer expressions of
pleasure at the meeting. r
Mme. Francisca arrived later and in
the interim there was music by the
Regensburger Orchestra. The advent
of the song bird brought a flutter of
happiness, for she was good to look
at and charming to meet, with the gra
ciousness born of. the true artist and
kindliness of heart. ." V> : -.- : -
All was as it should be and a more
perfect afternoon could not have been
anticipated.

The -
baldheaded
row
Baldheaded men have
long been a standing
joke in every theater-
going community, but
nevertheless the loss of
the. hair and the unsightly
condition which it imposes
upon the unfortunates who
compose the baldheaded
row is often a source of
keen mortification.
The baldheaded row,
however, will speedily
become practically a thing
of the past, because the
more Coke Dandruff Cure is
used the more it proves
itself capable of positively
gTowing hair on bald heads,
a claim which was not
originally made by the
inventor. The formula, as
originally evolved, was
intended only to eradicate
and cure conditions of
dandruff and diseases of
the scalp, but to the
surprise and delight of
constant users, it quickly
demonstrated its ability to
restore the hair follicles to
their youthful vigor and
thereby produce a glossy
and luxuriant growth of
hair.'
Thousands of people
in every rank and walk of
lift who have sent us grateful
testimonials will attest the
truth of this. You don't
have to take our word or
theirs for it. If troubled
with dandruff, falling hair
or any scalp disease, try
it for yourself. We are
quite willing to abide by
the result. Your druggist
will tell you the same
story. Ask him.

NOT FOR BEST FAR3I
In the State.
"I saw so much in the papers about
the wonderful cures effected by Pyra-
mid Pile Cure I determined to give it
a trial. I bought from my druggist one
60-cent box and used it as directed, and
by the time I had used the last 'pyra-
mid' I was entirely cured; in four days
after I began to use 'the 'pyramids' all
inflammation was gone. I was perfect-^
ly easv all the time, the excessive dis-"
charge stopped at once and stools be-
came easy and gentle.
"I was unable to get my own firewood
for four months, and half the time
when I could walk at all I had to walk
half-bent. I used many pile remedies,
salves and ointments, all to no effect
until I used one 50-cent box of Pyramid
Pile Cure and was cured.
. "I would not be afflicted as I was four
months ago for the best farm' in "the
State of Arkansas. I can give' proof
and reference of the wonderful cure to
all who are afflicted as I was. Please
publish my letter that I may advise the
afflicted." W. E. Wallis, Piggot, Ark.,
box 26. .
The experience of Mr. .Wallis is that
of thousands of others who suffer for
years with the most painful forms of
hemorrhoids or piles, and after trying
everything they hear of give up all hope
of a cure and look for temporary relief
only. To all such a little book published
by Pyramid Drug Co., Marshall, Mich.,
brings glad tidings, as it tells all about
the cause and cure of piles and is sent
free for the asking.

a retired contractor, over. 60 years of
age, shot and instantly killed Joseph
McGowan ' yesterday at 2965 .Mission
street. ; Smith was arrested shortly after
the tragedy by Policeman E. Thompson
Row Over a Trifle
Ends in -Fatal
Shooting.
The quarrel wasengenderedin a busi
ness dispute. Smith, who formerly con
ducted the terra cotta works; where ,the
shooting occurred, had leased it to the
elder McGowan,. but he still lived in a
cabin on the grounds. With him lived an
employe of the McGowans, James Beat
ty. Smith and Beatty became involved
in a row over, a trivial . matter, and the
latter telephoned for young McGowan.
By the time McGowan arrived Smith
was in a savage mood. The old fellow
rushed to the front of the yard and shut
the picket gate In McGowan's face. This
seemed to anger the younger man, and
he struck at Smith through the pickets.
Then Smith threw- open the gate and
he and McGowan clinched. Smith '.got
the worst of the encounter and retreat
ed to his house and soon returned with
a shotgun. He ran over to where Mc-
Gowan was talking to William Buttle
and raised the gun to his shoulder. Mc-
Gowan seized Buttle and attempted to
use him as a shield, but the old man
was too Quick for, him. . He fired, and
the charge, of buckshot tore one side of
McGowan's face away,' killing him in
stantly. ;
Without looking at his victim
Smith turned .away and started to
"search for, Beatty with the- smoking
and charged with murder. The victim
was 30 years old and a son of Matthew
McGowan of .Â¦ the contracting, firm of
Buttle & McGowan.
'Barth was released to-night and in
timates^ that \he will prosecute spme
one for .having forcibly detained him.
While Barth protests his innocence
the officers hold to the theory that
he placed the explosives ort the track
and flagged the train, expecting the
passengers to reward him for saving
their, lives. Word from Chico Is to the
effect that Barth has a clear record.

FOR PAYING TAXES
Tax Collector Smith reports that
taxpayers were more dilatory this year
than any previous year in settling with
the city. He calculates that there is
still more than $1,000,000 to be col
lected Monday, (. but he is prepared
with extra facilities to take in the
money with no delays, as he will have
stven cashiers to do the work. His
clerks have been working day. and
night to accommodate property-own
ers. Yesterday the^ United Railroads
paid $320,000 in taxes, protesting,
however, against the levy for the bond
issue. It was these protests that
caused the delay in" collections. ~
To-morrow will be the last day for
the collection of the first installment
of. taxes on real property. At 6 p. m.
sharp they will become delinquent and
15 per cent penalty will be added after
that time.

Election Cases Continued.
"While I was engaged in cooking
breakfast in a room adjoining Smith's
a little dog belonging to him came in.
I swore at the dog and chased him
out. That made Smith angry^ and
after calling me names he got his* shot
gun and snapped it In my face. Then
I telephoned twice .to Joe McGowan
about it.
"When McGowan came Smith bar
red the gate on him. Smith got -the
shotgun a"nd shot â¢ McGowan. He was
only a few feet away at the time."
John '" Cogger also saw the shooting.
Smith had sent for him and Gabriel
Carrau,* saying that he had work for
them. When they arrived he told them
that he had had .' some trouble and
wanted them to stand by him. Car
rau was not present when the shot
was fired. Â£..
.The news of the tragedy has pros
trated Mathew, McGowan, father of
the dead man. He lies at his residence,
629 Hayes street, in * a critical condi-.
tlon. He is over 70. years of age ami
his daughters fear that the shock will
kill him.
The body of young McGowan was
taken to the Morgue and Detectives
Fitzgerald and Graham .were detailed
on the case. The weapon U3ed is an
old-fashioned percussion-cap shotgun.
Smith has the. reputation In the
weapon in his " hands. Muttering,
""Where is > that brakebeam fellow?"
he walked through the yard and then
back to the house. A crowd began to
congregate and he came to the door,
still carrying the gun.
"I've got another load here," he an
nounced, and began to fumble with
the trigger. The gun was discharged
and the shot tore through the sids
of an adjoining house.
"When seen at the City Prison
Smith did not seem to realize the
gravity of his offense. "Yes, I shot
him," he frankly admitted. ""We had
a quarrel and he hit me. You can
see where," pointing to a deep gash
on his cheek.
"But I didn't want to shoot the boy.
I wanted to get Beatty. ThaVs the
only thing that I regret; I didn't get
him. McGowan was a nice boy and
his father is a fine man. I don't
know how I can face the old man
when he hears I shot his son. I didn't
want to get Joe; I wanted Beatty, but
he got away/
"No, I wasn't drinking much last
night â 'that is, not any more than
usual. " I always keep plenty of whis
ky in my house. I got in ten gallons
the other day.
"McGowan abused me shamefully
when I shut the gate. He called me
bad names and struck at me through
the gate and hit me on the nose. Then
I opened the gate and went after him v
We had a fight and I got the worst of
it because I am an old man. Then I
got the gun and I was excited and shot
him." 'Â¦;;>
Smith made his statement in a mat
ter of fact way. The fact that he had
not killed Beatty seemed to be his
only worry-
The coat of William Buttle, who
stood between Smith and McGowan
before the shot was fired, was spat
tered with blood. He was only a few
feet from the victim when the uhot
gun's report rang out. He was dazed
for, a moment and saw young McGow
an fall and watched Smith as he
slunk away from j his victim.
Beatty, the man whom Smith was
so anxious to kill, tells the following

BEWARE
Of a cough, especially of infants
and delicate children. Don't wait
until the cough becomes hard, the
throat inflamed and the lungs and
bronchial passages congested.
Avoid cough remedies that contain
opiates, stupefying drugs and dan-
gerous anodynes. .They only
quiet the symptomsâ drug the
cough into silence â but that is not
curing. A weak place is left to
cause trouble later. A remedy
must be used to subdue the in-
flammation, stimulate the secre-
tions, soothe and heal the irri-
tated membranes and cure the
cough to stay cured. -
<^Â§^S__^g =Ss r-/
Irish Moss Cough Balsam is such
a jemedy. It enjoys the indorse-
ments of many physicians, who
use it in their daily practice. Sold:

During the forenoon there was a warm
fight over reports of the committee on
resolutions recommending the rejection
of a resolution introduced by the dele
gates of the Seamen's International Un
ion that called upon the American Fed
eration of Labor to prevent the Interna
tional Longshoremen's Association from
using the name" or claiming any Juris
diction' implied by the title of "Long
shoremen's," Marine and Transportation
Association." There had not been .= a
hotter struggle since the opening of the
convention. ,'.J ','Â¦'Â¦
It' was asserted in the convention by
Vice President" Duncan, chairman of
the committee on; resolutions, that the
language , in the preamble to the reso
lution was misleading, in that It assert
ed that the American Federation had
at a "previous convention decided the
case against the i International Long
shoremen's Association. The alleged
grievance of the Â¦ seamen against the
longshoremen was that the longshore
men refuse to workon board ships with
the seamen- on the gulf and on the
Great Lakes who have chartered bodies
In these localities.
The majority report; of the commit
tee fin resolutions advised that a con
ference should be held to the end. that
an /agreement might be reached I con
cerning the â¢ matters at V. Issue. The
minority report, which was signed : by
one : member, set forth that "the com-
Pittsburg was selected for the next
place of meeting." The other cities that
tried to get the convention of 1905 were
St.' Louis, Mo. : Toronto, Canada, and
Niagara Falls, N. Y. The majority, for
Pittsburg was large. One vote was cast
for New York City and two for Porto
Rico.
Feeney of Philadelphia was elected
delegate to the Canadian Trade Union
Congress, beating James A. Lavery of
New York.
"In my "report I said that the trades
union movement. is not ungrateful, and
gives due credit where such credit be
longs. If there is anything, due. how
ever, it is due by me to labor and not by
labor to me. â . Â¦
"Labor has given me the opportunity
of acquiring knowledge and experience
and I want to give In return to the la
bor \ the result ! of that ' ex
perience and information. -I want you to
feel assured after adjournment and go
ing home that when yoV assemble again
in conychtion a year from now you
will have no" cause for regret that you
have placed this , additional confidence
in me. I cannot ! say more.' I thank
you."' .:;."' 'X' Â¦â¢:â¢ '.-Â¦,' . ';
In addition to .they executive ' council
the convention -had to elect -fraternal
delegates to! foreign; countries. John A.
Moffltt of 'Philadelphia was elected '.the
first fraternal \ del egate to the British
Trade Union Congress without contest.
It was, necessary 'to have'a^roll call to
determine .whether Edmund F. Ward of
the brewery or James Wood
ofc: San 1 Francisco of the ~ clgarmakers
should be thesecond delegate. The vote
resulted In the' election of Wood.: Frank
"I cannot express," said Gompers,
"what I feel. Anything I can say is de
ficient In expressing the deep apprecia
tion of the obligation that I am under
for the honor that has been conferred
upon me. Having grown up in the labor
movement, I have tried to give the best
there is In me to the trades union
cause. If I deserve your good will and
confidence I want to assure" you that
that is all the recompense and reward
that T hope for. J>
"I do not. give assurances of what
I will do. 1 have but one thing in mind,
and that is to advance the cause - of
labor â¢ and to; give my fellow workmen
the best "that is in me.
tory. They promised to do as well in
the future as they had in the past.
Gompers spoke longer than the others.
He was seemingly affected by the dem
onstration. Delegates asked "Who is
all' right?" and answered "Sam's all
right." If there had been any doubt
that he was still the head of the Amer
ican Federation of Labor by the choice
of the delegate:* the doubt was amply
disproved by the manner of his re-elec
tion and the demonstration that fol
lowed It.
mittee admits that the seamen are
technically correct; that the action
proposed by the majority report is
equivalent to Inviting the International
Longshoremen to go on taking all they
can get, and, while they take seamen
to-day, it may be that they will take
teamsters and streetcar men next."
The minority report was signed by
William Cohen.
Andrew Furuseth said that he. was
sorry that granite cutters and ' car
penters in the executive council of the
American Federation of Labor should
pass upon and adjudicate maritime af
fairs. He spoke of Duncan and Foster
or the executive council, and, a little
later, Foster paid his attention to
Furuseth and also to Macarthur and
said that "until this morning I sup
posed that the executive council of
the American Federation of Labor was
a band of .honorable men and I did
not find out until Macarthur spoke
that they are a band of pirates, armed
to the teeth and sailing under the
black flag, under the leadership of
Commander Keefe of the lakes."
Macarthur said "as a matter of fact,
the Longshoremen's Association has
already chartered bodies of purely
seafaring, or maritime workers, as, for
instance, marine firemen, engineers,
tugboat men and cooks. Further, the
longshoremen on the Pacific Coast
have formally declared their refusal to
work on board ship with members of
the Sailors' Union of the Pacific.
These statements are matters of record
and they prove, If proof were needed,
that the name assumed by the .. long
shoremen is more than / a formality,
that, in fact. It' implies actual jurisr
diction over maritime workers and Is
so understood and intended by the
longshoremen. It would be folly upon
our part to : Ignore the situation thus
presumed and it would be 'a misfor
tune should this convention fall to
take cognizance' of the ' real,_ the ma
terial issue now before it."
; The fight waged so hot, many speak
ers taking part, that when it was
voted to shut off the debate there were
cries 'for a roll call from all parts of
the convention. The contest was
close, the minority 'report being, de
feated in a poll of 14,754 votes byj a
majority: of only 704 votes, the vote
being 7025 for and 7729 against. Then
"The , convention has done splendid
work, and I wish you godspeed and sue-,
cess, and do your best work for the
great cause in which we are enrolled."
Delegate Westoby then mounted the
platform and led in the singing of
"America" and "Auld Lang Syne." and
on the motion of Vice President O'Con
nell the convention was adjourned sine
die. , .
To the executive council was left the
consideration of a resolution to obtain
time allowance for the men In the Mare
Island Navy Yard. A resolution was
adopted thanking the citizens of San
Francisco, especially the union men
an,d women and the press, for courtesies.
The local committee came In for praise.
The Building Trades Alliance was re
ported to be In harmony with trade un
ionism, and affiliation was recommend
ed. Laws were suggested by the com
mittee on building trades to preserve
the lives and limbs of men employed in
building.
Just before adjournment President
Gompers addressed the convention and
said: "We desire to thank the citizens
of San Francisco and California for
hospitality, entertainment and encour
agement during the convention. The
discussions have at times been very
heated, but at all times exceedingly in
teresting, and I do not doubt but that
better feeling, pervades the Federation
than existed before the convention.
"I am sure that the manner In which
the delegates conducted themselves has
won for our. movement golden opinions
In San Francisco. I have heard favor
able comment on all sides. A few days
ago a newspaper reporter showed me a
telegram from- Washington In which it
was stated that an effort would be
made by some members of Congress to
deny the right of Government employes
to organize.. I was asked to express an
opinion, and I want to say now that I
do not believe that any legislator of
either branch of the Government se
riously entertains any such idea, and
that It Is probably a pretense .on the
part of antagonists.
v'1. believe that I express your senti
ments and those of every fair-minded
citizen that when a man or a woman
becomes an employe of the Government
his rights as an American citizen are
not surrendered or curtailed. If any
official proposes such a law he will find
the active opposition of organized labor
before him, and he must take the con
sequences.
the convention voted to have the roll
called to decide whether the majority
report of the committee on resolutions,
advising a conference between the la
boring men principally concerned In
the matter, should be adopted. The
two roll calls took up so much time
that no announcement of the result
was made until the evening session of
the convention. The final decision was
to turn down the majority report â
8434 to 6952.
, After the vote had been cast by
the secretary for Gompers for presi
dent, Victor L. Berzer arose. *. For a
time It ' was Impossible for ; him ' to
make : his voice heard above, the" din.
Finally he was heard : to say that he
desired to go on record as against the
election of Gompers.
The speeches of the re-elected offi
cers in acknowledgment was perf unc-
Gompers - received the greatest
demonstration. Chairs were , beaten
on the floor, boot heels. thumped vig
orously, hands claDped, handkerchiefs
waved and the lungs of the more
uproarious taxed to their limit.
Gompers was naturally ' the central
figure. He did not immediately re
spond to calls for a speech. '
For the positions of fifth and eighth
vice presidents there were aspirants
other than the officers of last year, but
the old officers easily won out For
third vice president Thomas I. Kidd
and Joseph C. Bahlhorn were nomi
nated. On the rollcall Kldd received
11,879 votes to 3569 for Bahlhorn.
For the office of eighth vice president
It was. necessary to call the roll twice.
On the first call the vote was "as fol
lows: William J. Spencer of Chicago
6761, Henry Sherman of Washington,
D. C, 3476, James Grimes of San
Francisco 3118, O. A. Tveitmoe of
San Francisco 2002. As 7679 votes
were necessary to elect, a second roll
call was had. which seated Spencer,
who had 7984, votes to 3204 for Sher
man and 4082 for Grimes. Tveitmoe
being dropped altogether after the
first rollcall.
This completed the membership of
the executive council of the American
Federation of Labor for another year.
The official board was returned to
office without exception : and this was
considered by the delegates to have
carried with it Indorsement of .the
policy of Gompers and his official
associates.
Frank Morrison, the secretary, and
John B. Lennon, the treasurer, were
re-elected by the casting of one bal
lot for each, under the convention's
direction.
By vote of the convention the sec
retary was instructed to cast one bal
lot for; Gompers and successively one
for each of the following named vice
presidents: James Duncan of the
Granite Cutters, John Mitchell of the
United Mine Workers, James O'Con
nell of the Machinists, Max Morris of
the Retail Clerks, Denis A. Hayes of
the Glass Bottle Blowers' Association
and Daniel J. Keefe of the Tobacco
Workers.
Samuel Gompers was re-elected
president of the American Federation
of Labor yesterday, together with the
incumbent executive council, which
embraces eight vice presidents, secre
tary and treasurer. Gompers received
all the votes of the convention with
the sole exception of that of Victor
L. Berger, editor of a Socialistic jour
nal published at Milwaukee.
Judge Fritz dismissed > the battery
charge against C. F. Reimer. who at
tacked a man he discovered in the act
In the court of Judge Mogan a
comewhat similar -complaint was
taken under advisement until his
Honor can decide which of twÂ« con
flicting sections of the Penal Code
it most to be respected. L. M. Walter,
a grocer at California and Devlsadero
streets, sold a bottle of whisky to
Patrolman J. Berry, and when ar
raigned he pleaded ignorance of the
law. He did not keep a bar, he t ex
plained, and as the liquor sold by him
was an unbroken package, he did not
think he was violating any ordinance.
So the Judge gave himself until
Thursday to weigh the maxim, "Ig
norance of the law excuses no one"
against that (section of the Penal Code
which declare* that In law-breaking
there "must exist union or Joint opera
tion of act and intent-"
"We cannot dismiss you, Mr. Mc-
Cullough." said the Judge, "because
then? is no question of your guilt as
charged, although it appears that you
were induced to sell the whisky by a
pitiful storj' told you by the officers.
However, we . find a way out by
Â¦which neither the law nor your good
name would be sacrificed. Instead of
finding you guilty and Imposing the
usual fine of $20 I will continue your
case one week and reduce your $50
bail to $20 and if you fall to appear
here next Saturday and your bail is
forfeited it will be your own fault."
Judge Cabaniss dealt diplomatically
though legally and mercifully with J.
S. McCullough. who keeps a grocery
store in the Richmond District and
â¢who was accused of selling liquor
without a license. "Mr. McCullough
did rot deny that two plainly clothed
policemen purchased a bottle of
whisky from him, but he objected to
having a conviction entered against
his name on the police records. In
deed, he expressed . a willingness to
pay J50 for dismissal of the case.
Miss Craig's defense was not ready
for launching when she appeared before
Judge Conlan, and a continuance till
Monday was granted.
Amos Hicks thought he knew enough
of feminine tricks and manners to carry
him safely through experiences that a
less sophisticated squire of dames might
suffer by, but that opinion faded after
his inning with Miss Bessie Craig, and
now he is willing to acknowledge that
he has much to learn of the moods and
Impulses that provoked a certain un
fortunate Prince of Denmark to pro
nounce woman a synonym for frailty.
Mr. Hicks and Miss Craig ate their
Thanksgiving dinner tete-a-tete in his
bachelor quarters at 13 Polk street, and
at the conclusion of the meal he re
quested her to make herself at home
there until he could dispose of some un
avoidable business downtown, when he
Â¦would return and escort her to a thea
ter. His business delayed him longer
than he had expected, and several hours
had passed when he regained his apart
ment*âto find Miss Craig absent, also
his gold watch, a phonograph, some of
his choicest clothing and several less
valuable articles which he had left there
Â¦with her.
After the defendants had pronounced
the case spite work and a mean trick,
the court gave them till December 5 to
construct a more logical defense.
Patrolman George Barry testified that
sever in all his experience as a hunter
of "blind pigs" had he encountered
more complete facilities for violating
the liquor ordinances than were estab
lished In the suite Jointly occupied by
Miss Russell and Miss Benton in a Ma
eon street lodging-house of many in
mates. There are some pretentious bar
rooir.s in town, he averred, that would
appear as mere grogrgeries if placed in
direct comparison with the establish
ment presided over by the defendants.
Not only in the matter of stock and
fixtures, but also In the science of mix
ology had the ladles evidently studied
to please. They could fill with neatness
and dispatch any order tendered to
them. "With equal art and expedition
they could draw steam beer or build a
pousse cafe more variegated of color
than the rainbow. And their prices
Â¦were less prohibitory than the elab
orateness of their equipment might
have warranted. Of course, they exer
cised necessary discretion in dispensing
their wet goods, and if they had not
been shrewdly deluded Into belief that
the complaining witness was a plain
citizen with ample pecuniary means
and liberal ".views he never could have
succeeded In inducing them to sell him
a drink.
When the Misses Dora Russell and
Belle Benton were arraigned before Po
lice Judge Mogan on the charge of sell
ing liQUor without a license they unre
servedly pronounced their arrest an
outrage.
"It's spite work," said Miss Russell.
"It's a dirty, mean trick." said Miss
Benton.
Paul Bottger Is in Mexico, while the
man he iÂ» accused of assaulting with
intent to do great bodily harm is re
ported to be dying from the effect of
his injuries. So a bench warrant haa
been issued by Judge Mogan tor Mr.
Bottger's arrest and his/examination
continued till December 26, by which
time the man whom; he assailed will
be either dead or out of immediate
danger.
Charles Norris, a lumberman, en
tered Paul Bottger's saloon at Sixth
and Folsom streets one night about a
month ago and behaved In such a dis
orderly way that Bottger forcibly
ejected him to the street, where, his
head violently collided with a side
walk and his skull was fractured.
Since then he has been in a hospital,
and his condition has steadily grown
worse until the surgeons now, consider
his recovery extremely doubtful.' Bott-'
ger was released on nominal ball.
Max Gilber, fruit peddler, averred
that he was sound asleep and did not
hear Patrolman Maloney's command
that he "move on" his horse and wa
gon. Fatigued by the unwonted tax
ation on his physical energies occa
sioned by the Thanksgiving demand
for his wares, Mr. Gilber explained,
he leaned against his vehicle as It was
slowly hauled along Post street be
tween Powell and Stockton and slum
ber Instantly enchained his faculties.
The horse must have voluntarily
ceased traveling.
Judge Conlan held that even if Mr.
Gilber had stopped the horse while
he (Mr. G.) slept,, a person cannot T>e
held accountable for an act commit
ted while in a state of somnambulism.
Therefore the case was dismissed.
Morris Cohn, charged with pool
selling in his cigar store on lower
Bush street, was due for trial in Judge
Mogan's court last Friday, but an at
torney obtained a continuance of one
day by pleading that the defendant
was attending a funeral of an old and
dear friend. When the case was called
yesterday there was no appearance of
Mr. Cohn and the Judge, after ex
pressing a hope that the alleged ob
sequies would be concluded before to
morrow, issued a bench warrant for
the absent one's arrest and presenta
tion to court on that day.
Lizzie Sharkey celebrated her re
lease from serving a sixty days' "bit"
for drunkenness by attiring herself in
new and goregous raiment and im
bibing strong waters until she was ar
rested on the same old charge. As
she stood before Judge Fritz, her ap
pearance was not prepossessing, for
her ultramarine gown hung awry, her
green picture hat was shedding its
crimson plumage and her front hair
drooped in irregular festoons. She
promised to go to Berkeley and, re
main there evermore if the Judge
would dismiss her, but instead of do
ing that he sent her to jail for three
months. It was her eleventh convic
tion for inebriety in public places.
> Instead ~ ot< tender! ng * oral response
Mr. Garriett planted one of his fists
on Ah Bing's mouth and Ah Bing
shrieked as he dropped.
"The sidewalk was narrow and this
chink was zigzagging along as if he
owned it," Mr. Garriett said to Judge
Cabanlss. "I kicked his heel acci
dentally and then he swore at me."
"I'll overlook the kick and fine you
ten for your flstwork," said the Judge.
"Dam foolee, wha' fo' kickee?'.'
Ah Bing was sauntering* along a
Chinatown sidewalk when his left heel
was suddenly and painfully Jarred and
turning around he discovered G. Gar
rlett drawing back his right leg as if
with intent to deliver a second kick.
Nimbly skipping backward. Ah Bing
demanded:

PORTLAND IS SHUT OCT.
The - Commuters can point with
pride to yesterday, the day of days at
Recreation Park. " They won '&" game
and from the Seals at that. It was a
close . boy ,7 but a victor y nevertheless.
Graham all but topsed It away. in the
ninth spasm, but he got good at- the
last moment and the Commuters were
there. Score, Oakland,, 5; San Fran
cisco 4.
Not'l a hit did the victors make in
any inning save the seventh, when
they |\vung safely on Mr. Barber" six
times. These six hits produced, five
runs and broke up the game. Dun
leavy started the rally wlthv a two
bagger against the center afield fence.
Then every one on the team with the
exception of Schlafley, Devereaux and
Francks took a crack at the ball and
the runs kept pouring "in till Francks
hit to Anderson and doubled up M03
kiman at second base. " But for that
they" might have been still making^
runs. ...
The Seals could not hit Graham,
but he was wild and his support was
something awful. He contributed
three errors and they all counted in
the run getting. In the ninth Graham
walked Gochnauer and Van Buren^
but Hildebrand flew out to Moskiman
and ended the game. .-.
Artie Kruger, Oakland's center
fielder, suddenly . decided he would
quit the sunny State of California
and packed up his baggage- yesterday
before the game started and made a
hasty getaway. The season will, close

No ordinary plater'is going, to take
the â¢ measure of San Nicolas, in his
present form. The black horse went
to! the post an odds on favorite for
the concluding mile selling affair and,
with Davis In the saddle, simply, made
a gallop of It. Kunz dropped in sec
ond, .with Ishlana, a length' in ad
vance of.EveaG, ,
Of course,; the transformation must
come when everybody was down good
and thick on Toledo, for that is racing.
,Â¦ Divina, too, has developed a sour
disposition of late, so Trainer Winchell
had'her fitted with blinkers. She took,
to them and to the 100 pounds as
signed kindly, and, after being rated
along behind Toledo by Sheehan to the
stretch, forged ahead and -in a drive at
the- end defeated Blue Eyes, with
Davis up, a length and a half.
Toledo ran third, while Ink, of which
much was expected, finished fourth.
Despite the fact that there was a
steady play on the winner, the price
went back from 3 to 5% to 1.
Davis distinguished himself by again
piloting three winners. Favorites fail
ed to accomplish much, falling heir to
but two purses. As the weather looked
a trifl^ threatening.'- the smale popula
tion greatly; outnumbered the gentler
sex. I ;'; Â¦' . J â¢'Â¦' / Â¦Â¦'â¢â¢Â¦"Â¦ Â¦""â¢Â¦-:'â¢ Â¦ jj .-.;Â¦ Â¦
The Reprobate,; from the stable of J.
O. Keene, beat Golden Buck, the favor
ite, by a ; harrow "margin for the intro
ductory number, a scramble for maiden
two-year-olds. Helgesen handled the
winner, which outbroke the field. While
"Big Bill" Knapp' rode an energetic and
persevering. race on. the first choice, he
fell. short at the wire by a head. Lilli
tus, a promising youngster from the
Hackett string, ran a fair third..
MIMO'S-RIDER IN HARD LUCK.
Apprentice Frank Sullivan, who had
the mount on Mimo. favorite for the
Fix and a half furlong run following,
played in all sorts of ill racing luck
cr the sprinter could not have lost. He
succeeded in getting pocketed in be
hind the pacemakers, Miss Culver, Ku
belik and Adirondack, and it was
not until within a furlong from home
that he could sit down and ride. Too
late then, for Dora I, a 15 to 1 shot,
which Holbrook had shot out of the
bunch, scored by a scant half length.
Ike Tullett finished third on Adiron
dack. Knapp had a tempestuous pas
sage with Foxy Grandpa.
When Bob Smith scratched Maxnar
â¢from the two-year-old event to be run
over the Futurity, course he simply
greased the way for Dr. Rowell's like
ly colt Corn' Blossom. At odds of 1
to 2 the latter simply played with his
company, running home four lengths
ahead of Ara. Mogregor took the
show from Alone" without much dif
ficulty.
Davis landed his second winner
when he reached the home, plate as
tride Sir Preston, second choice for
the six-furlong r run for all ages. Silent
Water, from Bob Smith's stable, en-
Joyed the first call in the ring, clos
ing a 9 to 10 chance.
SIR PRESTON AS PACEMAKER.
Sir Preston broke first; and set a
clinking good pace, closely trailed by
the favorite under restraint, Whoa
Bill In third -position. Swinging into
the straight for the stand, Sammy
Greenfield, on Silent Water, sent his
regrets and "Big Bill" Knapp with
Whoa Bill crowded on. all. sail In 'an
effort to overtake the leader. . Davis
rode a strong finish on Sir Preston
and while Whoa Bill responded game
ly, to punishment he was beaten out
a neck in 1:13%. Four lengths far
ther away came the favorite. The
eight other starters were entirely out-:
classed. / '
'' Wonderful to relate, though, this ca
pricious daughter of Bassetlaw has
suffered a return of the bloom of
youth and before a large crowd at
Oakland yesterday she captured the
mile, and an eighth handicap, reeling
off the distance in 1:53%.

PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 26. â West
Point defeated the Annapolis football
to-day, 11 to' 0^ â two touch
downs and one eoal. The score does
not properly Indicate the relative
strength of the two elevens, for prob
ably not in the history of the great
university game have two teams been
more evenly matched.
The first touchdown for the army
was the result of a fumble bygone of
the navy backs, but the brilliancy- with
which Tipton, the army center, took
advantage of the error has never been
excelled, if equaled, on a football
gridiron. The game had been in progress
less thaHi ten minutes before the navy
showed an unexpected strength in de
fense, while the army's much vaunted
offense had crumbled to naught. With
the ball in mldfield Smith, for the
navy, was hurled back for a loss.
Spencer also failed and Howard
kicked to the enemy's thirty-five-yard
line. I /'.-'
. West Point found the navy line a
Gibraltar and Torley kicked to mid
fleld. There ~were three Annapolis
men under the punt, but when all had
been thrown the ball rolled off to one
side -of the mass of players. Tipton,
coming on from behind with- muscle
and brain both in good working con
dition, kicked the ball toward the
enemy's goal. Pursued by half a
dozen navy men he had no time to
stoop and secure the sphere, but, rush
ing on, he again dribbled it. His aim
was accurate and the ball was driven
nearer the navy's goal. When within
fifteen yards of the coveted line Tip
ton knew that a touchdown for the
army was inevitable. As he drew near
to the goal he began to loosen his
burdensome headgear and nose guard,
that he might be enatiled to locate the
ball with more accuracy. A third
kick and the pigskin was behind the
navy's goal, Tipton lying upon it.
Such deliberation and rare Judgment
in a moment so trying was truly re
markable. It was probably the turn
ing point of victory for West Point.
Up to thjs time the Annapolis boy3
had really outplayed their heavier
opponents, and on the exchange of
punts. ald,ed by 'a.stiff,wlncU.had grad
ually forced West Point nearer her
own goal line, u >',.*. i .?; ; ': > .
This touchdown gave West Point
the advantage of the wind and was
doubtless mainly responsible for. the
victory of the army over the navy.
Doe missed goal, and the score stood
5 to 0 in favor of the army.
On an exchange of punts the army
secured the ball on the navys' fifty
yard line. From this point it required
twenty-two minutes for the army to
force the ball to the navy's goal, and
this with a gift of five yards for off
side play.
A few minutes before the close of
the "game the navy, by brilliant line
bucking by Doherty, and Gormelee, the
latter having taken Smith's position
at fullback, carried the ball from
their own twenty-eight-yard line to
within twenty yards of West Point's
goal, where it was lost on downs. In
this half the advantage, if there
really was any, favored the navy.
The attendance was 30.000 and so
ciety was present in force. Among
the notables present were Prince
Fushimi of Japan. Vice President
elect and Mrs. Fairbanks. Secretary of
.the Navy Morton. Acting Secretary of
War Oliver, Lieutenant General and
Mrs. Chaff ee, Sir Mortimer Durand,

After the spectacular dash of the
Haskell team the Carlisle gridiron,
warriors recovered their true form and
completely outplayed the Westerners.
' The only time in the second half
that Haskell forced Carlisle to punt
was when the Westerners made a mag
nificent kick off their goal line, after
B. Pierce had made it a first down
on the Haskell four-yard line. Dillon
gained a yard and a recovered fumble
advanced the ball to within six Inches
of the Haskell goal, where the ball
again rested after Dillon had been sent
smashing against Haskell's right
guard. It was Haskell's ball and E.

Contagious Blood Poison, sometimes known as "THE BAD DISEASE," begins usnally with a little pimple
or sore, and this may bethe only external evidence for several weeks; bnt soon the glands in the neck and groins
swell, pimples_and red eruptions break out on the breast and 1 other parts of the body, the mouth and throat get
sore, the tongue heavily coated, the^hair falls out, and as the contamination more thoroughly saturates. the
system ; copper-colored , spots 'j and other severe symptoms make their appearance. Too often the sufferer turns to
the Mercury and Potash treatment and smothers and hides the disease in the system, and when they are left off he
finds^tha^ this masking. 1 of the disease has concentrated \ its strength, and it breaks forth again with consuming-
intensity. 'Mercury and Potash "not only fail to cure Blood Poison, but produce other severe troubles such as Mer-

Nuts Scarce In New Tork.
Late mall advices from New York say of
Nuts:
"The week closed on an active market, the
demand covering all varieties. While consump
tion Is not heavier than usual the fact that
nearly all buyers deferred purchases of Thanks
giving, supplies until the last possible moment
Is making it difficult for Importers and Jobbers
to take care of the business offered as rapidly
as buyers would like. Another factor 'which
imparts a buoyant tone to the market is the
unusually light stock of nearly all varieties
available for immediate delivery. Except in
the case of Brazil Nuts, the scarcity of which
is due to a short crop, the present stringency
in the market supply is attributable to the fact
that purchases made for forward shipment
from primary markets this season were on a
much smaller scale than usual. This is par
ticularly true, of Sicily Filberts, forward busi
ness In which was held in check by the high
prices resulting from a corner in the primary
market and the quits general expectation her*
that the Sicilian speculators who controlled
the crop would have to give . way If demand
from consuming markets was withheld. Tne
result is that at the present time stocks in
the hands of importers here are at a low ebb
and the market Is strong, with an uoward.

In addition to the cargo previously reported

"SHE DANCES"â Crippled by paralysis for
years, feeling gone, dragged foot, couldn't
rai?e it or put It forward, couldn't "creep"
along slowly without support; after Rex-
radlo's ONE treatment all these troubles
ceased; "feeling" returned, foot didn't drag,
put It forward fully, walked naturally with
"long" steps and NO SUPPORT, raised foot
18 Inches. "On reaching home I actually
â¢was able to DANCE, a thing I had never
expected to do the balance of my long life."
(NAME given.)
"THEY CLOSE"â "My long (unclosing)
ANCHYLOSED fingers were (last week) In-
stantly loosened and closed on my palm
after Reitrsdio's ONE treatment Four
years doctors and medicines had utterly
failed to help. I came from Sacramento for
! treatment and am abundantly satisfied."
I (NAME at offices.)
"FACIAL PARALYSIS"â "Cheek and lip par-
alyzed and without feeling; ONE treatment
by Rexradio and feeling returned and I could
naturally control the parts." (NAME given.)
"NEURALGIA was chronic and severe; ban-
Uhed promptly last week." (NAME given.)
j "LAMENESS from chronic SCIATICA, prompt-
ly cured last week. I ran and JUMPED."

given.)
"DROPSY" â "My bloat was very large; last
week Rexradio quickly reduced It"
j "POWERLESS HAND" â "Couldn't grasp or
1 hold things In my PARALYZED hand; Rex-
I radio's (one) treatment enabled me to do
both naturally last week." (NAME given.)
j "BALMY SLEEP"â "Rexradlo's SINGLE,
treatment wonderfully relieved my afflictions
and my INSOMNIA departed. Same night I
had the soundest, sweetest sleep I ever had
in all my life. I am greatly satisfied with,
these unexpected, wonderful results of Rex-
radio's FIRST treatment" (Name given.)
"QUICK AS A FLASH" â "Rexradio expelled
my terrible LUMBAGO and I 'bent' touch-
Ing floor with hands, RAN and LEAPED;
all before impossible." (Name given.)
"RHEUMATISM" â "Could not raise feet oft
floor, least movement agonizing. Rexradlo's
(first) treatment killed all pain, removed
muscle 'contractions.' and Instantly I threw
' my foot (painlessly) over the top of a high
< chair back." (Name riven).

PARIS, Nov. 26.â The French animal
protection society inaugurated an exhi
bition at the Petit Palais this week, the
wall posters calling attention to the
claims of animals on man. An angel
of mercy staying the hand of a brutal
driver is the theme of one-third of the
pictures. A child torturing a kitten is
another favorite subject
Pictures for Animal Protection.
\ Still there is undoubtedly a certain
amount of large staking In connection
with bridge, but it is only practiced
amÂ«ng a few. Occasionally some high
play Is indulged in at Chemin-de-fer.
Then, as winter comes on there are
many afternoon bridge parties, where
many women play, but not to such an
extent as the cranks who worry them
selves about the smart set and its sins
v/ould lead one to believe.
Poker also is played much more than
used to be the case, and is quite likely
to become general this winter.
Roulette is but seldom indulged In
nowadays in private houses. For one
thing it requires a large party to make
the game interesting, and few people
care to play for small stakes, which
generally prevail in country houses at
this game.
LONDON, Nov. 26. â Much surprise is
expressed at the discovery of heavy
gambling: at certain old established
London clubs where it was thought
such a thing was not permitted. It is
understood that a young man well
known in the social world won $70,000
in a short space of time, while another
young fellow lost $17,500 in one night's
play. "With another man It was Just
touch and go as to whether he had lost
510,000, when his luck turned and he
won.
The papers periodically announce
grave scandals in connection with
cards, but as a rule they are without
much foundation. For instance, no one
has told at what house in Scotland
enormous sums of money were lost this
last summer. Neither has the young
woman been found who Is said to have
lost $35,000 at bridge. ; ; ?
Then, It may be remembered, there
was much ridiculous gossip about an
alleged card scandal at a certain great
house which proved absolutely untrue.
Most people who stopped at that house
at the time have declared there was not
even the slightest foundation for the
story, which made such a sensation
around the "West End.

HEAVY GAMBLING REPORTED
IX OLD CLUBS IN LONDON
LONDON, Nor. 26.â Amonff the hun
dred of mayors who have been elected
this -week is one who attracted consid
erable attention by a singular offer.
The mayor of Huddersfield. in return-
Ing thanks for his election, said his de
sire was especially to have babies In
his community.
He would give to the parents of ev
ery baby born In his native place.
Longâ ood, during: his year of offlc* a
promissory note for Â£1, to be paid
when the baby reached the age of 1
year, together with a card bearing
simple, homely directions for the wel
fare of the child.
' He hoped that the offer would arouse
In a certain measure attention to the
question of Infantile mortality, upon
which the public conscience Is now
well-nigh dead. He was not a pluto
crat, or he might make the offer apply
to the whole borough; but as about
2000 children are born in the borough
within the year, it would be> rather a
"large order for him."

y Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Nov. 20.â Private advices from
Argentina, claiming that prospects- were good
for excellent harvest weather, had a depreFSing
Influence en the wheat market at the opening.
Another bearish factor was Increased ship
ments from Australia. Opening quotations on
December were off %@Vic at $1 lf$Wu 1 00%.
May was unchanged to 'Â«c lower at $1 10U<5J
1 10V4. From the start pit traders were In
clined to favor the selling side and, with th*
exception of fair covering- by shorts on the
slight Initial decline, offerings met with only
a F.mall demand throughout the entire day.
The general disposition seemed to be to avoid
taking new lines over Sunday. Immediately
after ihe opening prices experienced a momen
tary rally when December advanced to si OO^i
Â©1 10 and May to $1 10*i. The market, how
ever, quickly yielded to persistent selling and
prices gradually declined. Predictions of a
liberal Increase In the visible supply caused
additional bearishness late in the day. Tbo
low point on December was reached at $1 0S%
1 0S% and on May at |1 O9?4. The market
closed weak, with December %Â®!ic lower, at
$1 OS%@1 09. Final quotations on May were
at *1 10. a Iocs of iÂ£c.
Increased receipts and eood weather for the
curing of new crop resulted In a decline of lc
in the price of December corn. A prominent
commission house attempted to sell out a line
of Deceir.ber. but the demand was too light
to absorb the offerings. December closed lc
lower at 48?ic.
Oats were aulet. May closed unchanged at
31 i^c. December unchanged at 28& l fr29%c /

- mates of the Argentine crop put it about 135,
' COO. 000 bushete and there will be from 10.CCO.
: 000 to 11.00<).COO bushels available for export.
i Figures from Argentina, however, are usually

, has been moved. The last two crops as offl-
! dally estimated were practically the same
â¢ size Nevertheless, from the last crop of 118,.
. 000.000 bushels there has already been shipped

Appreciation was probably not so !
strong as that with which the play
was received at Berkeley ten days
ago, but the performance last night
deserved every word of praise that
was spoken for it at that time. The
treat of medievalism and the glimpse
into dead centuries is not calculated
to count for much at the box office
end; of the theater in these modern
times and , last night's venture was not
so successful from the financial stand
point as could be wished, that the
devotees of this form of dramatic art
might be encouraged in their efforts,
i The last scene, that of the Madonna
leaning over the cradle as the shep
herds come forward with their gifts,
was beautiful and Impressive. It was
a striking climax, effectively staged in
the midst of all the simplicity that
pervaded _ the performance. There
were other,: beautiful -pictures, and

PERSONAL..
John J. Murphy, the sandwich boy
cotter who has been parading for some
time past ln front of the Santa Fe
ticket office at CU Market street, was
served yesterday with a temporary re
straining order issued by United States
Circuit Judge Morrow commanding
htm and all others to refrain from
boycotting or in any way interfering
â¢with the property of the Atchlson,
Topeka and Santa Fe Railway or un
lawfully injuring Its business by
United States Deputy Marshal Morse.
JIurphy was indignant that he should
be routed out of his Job, and he was
loth to lay down his banner until it
was represented to him that disobedi
ence to the older would mean bis Im
prisonment.
The sandwich banner carried by
Murphy bore the following device:
"Don't patronize the Santa Fe Rail
road Company. Boycott declared by
American Federation of Labor. Ma
chinists, boiler-makers, pipefitters and
hfelpers en strike. Trains delayed from
two to ten hours. Incompetent me :
chanics cannot keep engines ln repair.
Danger to passengers. Loss to ship
pers."
The complaint filed ln the Circuit
Court names the following defendants:
J. R. Rowan, John Ready, C. H. Boltz.
H. "W. Williamson. S. A- Hayward, H.
F. Plotlow, Ix)uis Guiffra, Frank Gil
lardi. Chris Thomas, Arthur Franchl,
Frank Sharp, S. R. Pritchard. David
Wilson. E. W. Hatch, Thomas Rowan,
Thomas 1^. Wilson and others as John
Doe and Richard Roe. Thomas L.
Wilson is fourth vice president and
general organizer of the International
Association of Machinists. The com
plaint recites the walkout on the 2d
of last May in the company's shops at
Point Richmond and charges that
representatives of the associa
tion threatened to devise means
to Injure and destroy the lo
comotives, motive power, cars and
machinery so as to prevent the rail
road company from carding on any
business and to coerce members of
the association and others from work
ing for it. It is alleged that in pur
suance of an unlawful conspiracy the
machinery has been surreptitiously
tampered with at the instigation of
representatives of the association so
as to render seme of It unfit for use.
Complaint Is 'also made that persons
employed to take the place of strikers
have been waylaid and beaten and
that they have been threatened with
further bodily injury.
Judge Morrow issued the restraining
