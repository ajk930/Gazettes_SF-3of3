WHO DISCOVERED THAT H. U ECA DA SILVA DID NOT LAVISH ALL
HIS ATTENTIONS ON HER AXD WHO RECEIVED LETTERS. FROit HIM.
The Grand Jury also heard testi
mony of James W. Coffroth and the
election officers as to the frauds in
Precinct 103. The officers were C. W.
Jamison. J. W. Roach, Mark Cohen.
W. E. Gibbons, J. H. Sinclair and J. W.
Smallwood. William F. Humphrey,
who was a worker at the polls, was
also called. No important incriminat
ing evidence developed, no one being
able to tell who was guilty of the
illegal voting. Coffroth denied all
knowledge of it.
The Grand Jury struck its first blow
yesterday at the frauds committed so
boldly at the recent primary election.
The various committees which have
been at work the last week examining
rosters reported that evidence of crime
had been unearthed to an appalling ex
tent and the mood of the jurors was
such that when a case was made out
indictment was prompt.
The bill will be returned this morn
ing, charging Adolph Steffens, also
known as Otto Steffens, with voting
the name of another elector in Pre
cinct 73 of the Thirty-ninth Assembly
â¢District. The accusation- is based
principally on the testimony of Fair
fax H. Wheelan, who testified before
the Grand Jury yesterday that he wit
nessed the illegal voting by Steffena.
Wheelan saw the accused forge the
name of the citizen on the roster and
also the procedure of casting the
illegal vote. The witness noted the
time to be 4:45 o'clock.
The man -whose name was voted was
not near the polls that day and he will
so testify. On the roster one of his
initials is wrong and the number of his
residence was also given erroneously.
According to the testimony of Wheelan.
Steffens, tried, to carry .the namq and
residence in his mind,* not-being a.Â«i bold
as others, who took the register with
them to the roster.
Steffens is an intimate friend of
Charles Wyman, whose preliminary
examination on a similar charge, pre
ferred by Wheelan in the Police Court,
will be resumed this afternoon before
Judge Cabaniss. Steffens has accom
panied Public Works Commissioner
Maestretti to court when the case of
Wyman was being heard. He was for
merly employed in the Fire Depart
ment, but now has a position in the
City Hall. His age is about 23 years.
The indictment will be returned be
fore Judge Lawlor this morning at
9: SO o'clock.

RENO. Nev., Sept- 24. â The engine
of the eastbound passenger train be
came stranded on the Sierra Nevada
Mountains just west of the summit this
morning and it was four hours before
another engine arrived from Blue Can
yon and pulled It Into Reno.
The unusual delay was due to the
fact that the engine, one of the new
model oil burners recently placed on
the road, ran out of fuel. The heavy
grade and long train was the cause
of this and the accident probably will
result in the company making addi
tional arrangements for carrying a
larger supply of oil.

sis one 'feature of it was ; the.dedica

R." P. Putnam .on the site of Putnam's
birthplace. SenatorHoar made a his

men. He spoke clearly and logically,
but seemed feeble and after speaking
a minute^ or-two asked -"permission to
cover' his Â¦ head,- as a cool breeze -was
blowing in his face. He left the speak

At thattlme he was troubled' with lum

such a blow him - that -he- never I re
covered entirely, from its * effects. Â¦

absent ' from the sessions of the Senate
and remained at his hotel. He came
to â¢ his home | here ' soon after ; the ad

and his physician here, Dr. Gilman," 1 ad
vised him to* refrain during the sum

injunction, however, on at least three
occasions, his love for old associations

WANTS HIM NO MORE.
The activity of the Federal officials,
according to one of his letters to Miss
Burbank. ' whom he addresses as "My
Onliest Pretzel," annoyed him very
much. ,
; In one of his epistles he says: "Dunne
guards these Chinese too closely, but
when ,my plans mature I will beat
Dunne out before the close of the ex
position." < In another letter he admits
that he intended to get these women,
who were brought here in bond, mar
ried, so they could not be deported.
The letters found in Da Silva's pos
session, when he was arrested at St.
Louis, were addressed "to "My Dearest
Ami" by Miss Burbank, who is em
ployed as a stenographer in- the Chi
nese bureau in this city. Miss Bur
bank took great care to keep Da Silva
posted. regarding, affairs In Federal cir
cles. Such information â regarding the
proceedings of the. Federal Grand Jury
as leaked out, and newspaper^ clippings
regarding the doings of what was des
ignated as the Chinese ring, were punc
tiliously forwarded to St. Louis.
In one of these she writes: "Another
big roast in the newspapers to-day. I
am awfully afraidthere will be trouble.
The case, will come, up, before the Fed
eral Grand : Jury â¢ next' week.". Other
letters show that Miss Burbank was
well aware of the movements of Da
Silva, whom she expected to marry as
soon as he procured his decree of di
vorce.
OFFICIALS ACTIVE.
H. L. Eca da Silva, formerly an in
terpreter in the Chinese bureau, who,
after losing his position there, was in
dicted by the Federal Grand. Jury on
a charge of importing Chinese women
into this country for immoral purposes,
was released yesterday afternoon on; a

man whose affection she tolerated two
years ago. In the apartments occupied
by herself and parents at 531 Turk
street Miss "Agnita Burbank, another
of Da Silva's .fiancees, refuses to
discuss the matter at all. Inciden
tally there is an interlocutory decree of
divorce for Da Sllva"frOm' his Mongo-'
lian wife, and to add further to the
entanglement of hearts Is the mysteri
ous photograph of a beautiful, dark
eyed Spanish girl, whose Identity Is as
yet unknown. He has his local sweet
hearts guessing how many young
women have fallen victim to his blan
dishments.
The letters written by Da Silva to
Miss Burbank while in China and in
St. Louis are of an incriminating na
ture, showing that he was not merely
acting as an interpreter for a Chinese
company, but was actively engaged in
securing women for the "World's Fair.
The letters tend to show that it was his
ultimate intention, at the close of the
fair, to "marry" these women to other
Chinese, thus saving them from depor
tation without forfeiting the bond.

RENO. Sept. 29. â Charles TV. Iri3h.
a brother of John P. Irish of San
Francisco, and who for four years un
der Cleveland's administration waa
Surveyor General of Nevada, died to
day at Gold Creek, this State, after an
illness of two weeks. Deceased was
about 70 years of age and leaves a
widow and two daughters to mourn
his loss. The body has been shipped
to the old family home at Iowa City.
Iowa, for* interment.
Irish was one of the most noted en
gineers of the country. He directed
the survey of the Santa Fe through
Arizona and Colorado, surveyed the
Burlington and Northwestern route
through Iowa, did the first work on
the first railroads in the Dakotaa and
planned and carried into execution the
bridges across the Royal Gorge and
Grand Canyon.
State Senate. In 1868 he was elected
a Representative to the Forty-flrst
Congress, and re-elected to the three
following Congresses, but declined a
renomination to the Forty-fifth.
At the next session of the Legisla
ture (1876-77) he was chosen United
States 'Senator to succeed George S.
Boutwell, and took his seat March 5, !
1877. In the national senatorial hall
he remained until his death, being re
elected almost without dissent in 1883,
1889, 1896 and 1901, the last term
not expiring until March 5, 1907.
In both houses of Congress his fig
ure and work were forceful and nota
ble. As illustrating his standing as
a clear-minded lawyer it may be men
tioned that he was chosen one of the
managers of the impeachment trial
in 1876 of Mr. Belknap, Secretary of
War, and also a member of the elec
toral commission of the same year
that gave. the Presidency to Ruther
ford B. Hayes.
His experiences in State and national
political conventions were strong trib
utes to his fairness and ability as a
governing officer. He was chosen to
preside over the Massachusetts State
Republican Convention in 1871, 1877,
1882 and 1885, and over the Republican
National Convention at Chicago in 1880.
He was a delegate to the National Con
vention of 1876 at Cincinnati and to
those of 1880, 1884 and 1888 at Chicago,
being chairman of the Massachusetts
delegations In the last three Instances.
' Outside of politics his honors and the
demands for his L services were also
many. He, was an overseer of Harvard
College from 1874 to 1880, declining re
election; elected again in 1896 and re
elected for six years in 1900. He waa
at various times regent of the Smith
sonian Institution, trustee of the Pea
body . Museum of Archaeology, presi
dent and vice president of the Ameri
can Antiquarian Society; long a mem
ber of the Massachusetts Historical So
ciety, the Virginia Historical Society,
the American Historical Society, the
Historic-Genealogical Society, fellow of
the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, corresponding member of the
Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sci
ences and a trustee , of the Peabody
fund. - ' â¢
His mental equipment, both native
and acquired, was. -admirable. He was
a fine classical scholar, a good mathe
matician and well up to date In the
several branches of scientific knowl
edge; . . ii^-Mr^
The degree of LL.D. was conferred
'on him by four colleges, besides his
alma mater, Harvard, namely. Am
hurst, Yale, Dartmouth and the old
Virginia institution, William and Mary
College.
Those who say Senator Hoar was
narrow and partisan are referred by
his friends to the time when, having a
Republican majority behind him in
committee, he made a number of re
ports in favor of Democrats, either sit
ting members or contestants. In one
instance, Throckmorton of Texas, the
Democratic claimant for a seat, was
indorsed favorably by Mr. Hoar. Not
long after Throckmorton was out of
Congress a newspaper In his district
denounced Hoar as a bigoted partisan.
Throckmorton wrote a letter to the
editor, which was published, defend
ing Hoar and alleging that he was not
well- known -in the South, or such criti
cism of him would never have been
made.
Senator Hoar was made unppoular
in the North at one period by two inci
dents in which he strongly favored
Southern Interests and prejudices. Dur
ing the war the William and Mary Col
lege buildings were burned, not direct
ly by the connivance of Union generals
but, ap generally understood, by care
lessness." Mr. Hoar advocated warmly
on the floor of the House a bill to pro
vide $20,000 indemnity, but was never
able to get the appropriation, al
though he was successful in arousing
a. feeling of great bitterness in New
England. The^second incident was his
advocacy of the. restoration of Fitzjohn
Porter. . General Grant approved hla
course, but New England did not.
Some years ago in Washington, in
the hearing (of a Worcester man and
one of the then proprietors of, the Bos
ton Herald, Senator Blackburn of Ken
tucky,, in the cloakroom of the Senate,
said, In remarks of congratulation that
Mr. Hoar had been re-elected: "I be
lieve Mr. Hoar is the broadest man in
the Senate."
Senator Hoar's, wit was keen and
searching. If one were to specify that
quality of the senior Senator which en
deared him to the old members of his
party and compelled the admiration
and deep sympathy of the young men,
he would name, his humor. . His wit
was never boisterous nor comic nor
that of a buffoon, but delicate | and
clean, founded on standard compari
sons and lasting beyond the fleeting
moment.
His scrupulous regard for honorable
dealings in his public office was widely
known. His co/le allowed of the recep
tion of not even simple courtesies from
corporations who deal with, the public.
A few years ago, in a railroad trip fronv
New York to Washington, he occupied
a seat with one of the great railroad
managers. When the conductor came
along, Senator Hoar presented the reg
ulation ticket' to be punched, to the
surprise of his companion, who prom
ised to send him a pass at once. The
pass was sent, but returned to the
giver with a note of thanks.
, A notable thing in connection with
his : terni8 as representative was his
service â¢ on a . special committee on
claims and on elections. He was never
chairman, but invariably prepared the
reports. Many were leading cases and
are cited to-day both here and in the
British Parliament as laying down the
law in election cases.. . ' .. â¢
His lack of familiarity, with even old
/acquaintances, --often attributed to
coldness' and austerity, "was owing to a
natural shyness, which clung to him
through life. > His .mind, naturally â¢' re
trospective and -- contemplative, . was
busy ; continually, â¢ but - not -always with

NOTED MAN TO
HIS LONG REST
subjects suggested by his immediate
surroundings. And lastly, his near
sightedness often prevented the imme
diate recognition of friends in person
al contact.
The extent of his willingness to oblige
friends was unlimited. He had abso
lutely no reserve due to pride, vanity,
or the aristocracy of family. He would
talk to a street laborer in overalls as
respectfully as to the President of the
United States. His charities were un
ostentatiousâindeed, his payment of
education for two young colored men,
as a recent instance, was known not
even to all his relatives. He was not
rich, and the pecuniary amount, of his
charitable expenditures was a consid
erable tax.
His family affections were extremely
strong, not only as far as his immedi
ate relatives were- concerned, but all
his kindred. He liked to discover some
distant relative and speak affectionate
ly of him as his cousin, or whatever
the relationship might be.

WOODLAND, Sept. 29. â The splen
did tour of D. E. McKinlay and Hon.
James McLachlan through the Second
Congressional District brought them
to-day to this city, where to-night they
addressed a meeting that thronged the
opera-house. Much enthusiasm pre
vailed and the eloquent speeches of
both orators were given the closest at
tention by the great audience. The
addresses were confined mainly to na
tional issues, McKinlay referring inci
dentally to his own candidacy for Con
gress, the prospects of which grow
brighter every day.
In Colusa last night a ' prominent

The incident that has created the
most notable comment was the meet

Maryland leaders have been dissipatd,

Former Representative Ben C. Ca

said to mean a unit of effort from op

Among his callers to-day was John
Bogart, prominent as a labor leader.
Bogart had visited Judge Parker at
his home at Rosemount and called for
the purpose of continuing a discussion
touching on the relation of the Demo
cratic party to organized labor.
Indicative of an effort on the part
of Judge Parker to unite both fac

whose personal differences might in
terfere with harmonious work for the
national ticket, his callers during the
three days of his present trip to New

In this connection conspicuous
among those who visited the candi

at Zamboa, in the hills south of the

through the mountains to the west.
Toothing has been decided.

and hear Hon. Charles W. Fairbanks,
the party's nominee for Vice Presi

There is gossip in the political camps
tj the effect that Tom Geary, who is
now endeavoring to square Bell with
the voters of the Second District, con
templates ft journey to Humboldt to
square Caminetti with the voters of
Kureka. Geary's mission will prove fu
tile. The indelible records clearly prove
that Caminetti. as a member of Con
gress representing the old Second Dis
trict, went out of his way in a churlish
and narrow minded style to defeat a
measure appropriating a large sum of
money for the improvement of Eureka
harbor. Humboldt County never can
have any use for Caminetti. It is the
judgment of well informed politicians
that Caminetti's popularity in the Dem
ocratic party has vanished. At Santa
Cruz he allied himself with an unpopu
lar faction of his own party and .the
leaders of the other faction are giving
him the cold shoulder.
There is a happy feeling at Repub
lican headquarters over the result of
registration throughout the State. The
increase is mainly in Republican coun
ties. Los Angeles comes forward with
marvelous gain. The registered strength
of thÂ«Â» county exceeds 62.000. Judge Mc-
Kinley's prediction that Los Angeles
will give 15.000 majority for Roosevelt
may be verified. George Stone, chair
man of the Republican State Com
mittee, is elated over the local regis
tration of 82,000. He is making no pre
dictions, but he entertains the belief
that Roosevelt's majority in this city
will astonish the natives.

J. N. Gillette of Humtjoldt, candidate

was in the city yesterday and left town
last evening to fill speaking engage

paigner in California Mr. Gillette has
no superior and few equals. He knows

as a man of high character, exceptional

the support of the solid Republican
column in the district and will also win
the support of many Democratic voters,
as a reward for. his conscientious de

The close of the war found us face to face
with new duties. New responsibilities were
unexpectedly imposed upon us, but we have
hod the capacity and the national honesty
to meet them with humane and resolute pur
pose. We have met them in a manner to
strengthen and not to subvert our republican
Institutions. We have been inspired.- by no
imperialistic purpose and those who so be
<HÂ»ve misjudge . tha course of events . and Â¦ thÂ«
patriotic- purpose, of their . countrymen. The
flag of the United States was carried to the
Philippines to build up ' republican Institu
tions. The archipelago under the treaty of
peace became a part of the territory of the
United States, and as such entitled to our
protection. We have been in the Islands but
a comparatively brief period. It has been
less than six years since the conclusion of
the peace negotiations at Parts. In that time
insurrection has been suppressed, order re-
One of the unexpected problems we have
been obliged to deal with since the last Demo
cratic administration was the Spanish-Ameri
can war. It was entered upon reluctantly and
only when' diplomatic appealB to Spain were
unavailing. It was entered upon In the name
of humanity and by command of the voice
of Christian civilization. We departed from
the ways of peace with no thought of terri
torial aggrandizement or commercial exploit
ation.
In his speech to-night Senator Fair
banks made an exposition of the Re
publican policy in the Philippines, his
leading topic. He also discussed the
tariff and urged a continuance of the
Republican policies as necessary to the
welfare of the people at large. On the
Philippine question he said:
"You have done well by Bending
Heyburn to the Senate, but you would
dc better by sending another Repub
lican to sit with him.", .
The Spokane committee met' the
Fairbanks' train at Sand Point. The
committee consisted of a number of
the leading Republicans of Spokane,
including Mayor Boyd and State Sena
tor Crow, the latter a former class
matter of Senator Fairbanks at col

was also a member of the welcoming
party as a representative of the State
at large.
The party arrived in this city at 5:30
and at 8 o'clock the Senators were
es'corted to the Spokane Theater by a
number of marching clubs. They en
countered an pppos.ition demonstration
on the part of the Socialists, whose
candidate for President, Eugene V.
Debs, spoke in another theater in the
city during the evening.
TALKS OF ISJLANDS.
8POKANE, Sept. 29. â From Helena,
Mont., to Spokane, Wash., Senator
Fairbanks traveled to-day, crossing
the northern point of Idaho en route.
The day was more marked for its de
votion to sightseeing than to speech
making, and the striking beauties of
the Bitter Root and Cabinet ranges, as
well as the swiftly flowing Clarks ford
of the Columbia River and the Pend
d'Oreille Lake, were fully appreciated
by the Vice Presidential candidate and
his colleague, Senator Dolliver.
In Idaho the train was stopped at
Sand Point and Rathdrum for speeches
and at both places the talking was
from the rear platform of the EdÂ»e
more. Sand Point being a"n important
lumbering point, Senator Fairbanks
devoted his remarks largely there to
a discussion of the duty on lumber,
contending that /Republican policies
are necessary to the proper protection
of that industry. "'^He made no refer
ence to Senator Dubois* challenge to
discuss polygamy- at the stopping
places in Idaho, but at Sand Point
spoke in praise of Senator Heyburn,
saying:
where to locate the headquarters for
the Hayes campaign was postponed
nntil the next meeting of the commit
tee. Opinion was equally divided as to
having the headquarters in the Fifth
Congressional District or downtown
near the Republican headquarters. The
meeting adjourned at 10:15 o'clock.
Senator Dolliver spoke on the gen- j
eral issues of the campaigm, urging the ;
general efficiency of the Republican j
party/, . . >
The theater was crowded from start j
to finish and both Senators had the :
most careful attention. Their points
were enthusiastically applauded and Â¦
the meeting was considered a success |
from every point of view.
The Spokane Theater proved incap
able of accommodating more than a
fraction of the people who were in
the streets and anxious to hear the
visiting Senators. It therefore be
came necessary to organize an over
flow meeting. This was held at Elks' i
Hall and was well attended. , Senator |
Fairbanks paid no attention in his
speeches to a challenge for a joint de
bate from Senator Ehibois.
Senator Foster joined the Fairbanks j
party here and he and Senator An- I
keny will make the tour of the State |
with the Vice Presidential candidate.

NEW YORK, Sept. 29.â Although
successfully launched to-day, the bat
tleship Connecticut did not have her
bottle of wine broken by Miss Alice B.
Wellesi who had been selected as spon
sor for the ship. She threw the bottle
at the boat as the ship began to move
off the ways, but it failed to break
when it struck the vessel's side. Sec
retary of the Xavy Morton and Rear
Admiral Rodgers stood beside Miss
Welles. Rear Admiral Rodgers at
tempted to grasp the bottle as it re
hounded, but failed, and the ship was
moving off into the water when a
workman on the deck seized the string
that held the bottle and dashed the
Class receptacle of* the champagne
against th.> side of the ship, shattering
it to pieces, to the relief of the super
stitious. This was the only variation
of the prearranged plan, despite the
many sensational stories of attempts
to do the vessel damage. The navy
yard was crowded, it being estimated
rhat almost 30,000 persons witnessed the
launching. Every point of vantage was
occupied. Stands for invited guests
had been erected about the big red
hull, and outside of this was a fence
behind which the majority of visitors
vrerc kept.
Soon after 11 o'clock the cautionary

BUILT IN GOVERNMENT YARD.
The Connecticut Is a sister ship of
the Louisiana, and both vessels were
authorized by an act of Congress In
iaO2. The Connecticut was built in a
government yard and under govern
ment supervision, while the Louisiana
was built by a private shipbuilding
firm at Newport 'News, . Va. The con
struction of both ships has been fol
lowed with keen interest, as it was rec
ognized that it was a test of the gov
ernment's ability to cope with private
enterprise. Much depended on this
competition of construction, for if the
Connecticut is completed before the
Louisiana, then most of the govern
ment shipbuilding will be done by the
latter, and it is expected the New York
Navy Yard will be the shipbuilding
center for government work.
The Connecticut, when finished, will
be the finest arid most powerful boat in
the American navy, and will rank with
the most powerful battleships of the
navies of other nations. Notwithstand
ing the fact that a new plant had to be
created for the construction of the
Connecticut, this vessel is but 8 per
cent behind the Louisiana, although
laid down two months later.
The last vessel of any size construct
ed at the New York Navy Yard was
the ill fated battleship Maine.
The keel of the Connecticut was laid
down on March 10, 1903, the stem was
erected on July 25, the armor placed
aboard April 24 and the first Boiler
shipped on July 7.
1)131 ENSIONS OF NEW BOAT.
After the launching several hundred
guests were entertained at the Officers'
Club, at which Secretary Morton was
the guest of honor. A reception was
also held at the naval branch of the
Y. M. C. A., where a thousand were
entertained. Miss Helen M. Gould re
ceived. Secretary Morton and " Gover
nor Chamberlain were cheered by the
crowd, and both made short Informal
speeches.
The bow of the new battleship was
tastefully draped with a large Ameri
can flag. Naval Constructor Baxter,
in charge of the launching, was con
nected by telephone with all parts of
the ship and on hearing that every
thing was ready he gave the signal
to the workmen, passed the word to
Miss Welles, who threw the bottle of
wine against the bow as the great
steel hull was on its way to the wa
ter.
The ship started slowly at first, gain
ing momentum as it slipped into the
water. A chorus of whistles from the
vessels in the harbor drowned the
strains of the warship's bands as the
big steel hull rode safely on the water.
Owing to the rumors of the last few
days of an attempt to wreck the new
ship at the launching, there was in
tense feeling of suspense among the
spectators and the officials and em
ployes at the navy yard lest something
would mar the impressiveness 6t the
ceremony. , .
flag was run up on the huge crane over
the bow, and a few minutes later the
warning to "get away" was given, and
to the " accompaniment of creaking
timbers, booming guns, sirens and
whistles the big red hull slid into the
water at 11:16 o'clock. It took just
twenty-six seconds for the Connecticut
to clear the ways.

BELIZE, British Honduras, Sept 29.
â News has reached here of recent at
tacks by Indians on the camps of the
chicleros, or chewing gum gatherers in
Southern Mexico. As a result of these
attacks, seventeen were killed, eighteen
wounded and fifty-seven more either
murdered or carried into captivity.
The force of Indians consisted of about
three hundred and was led by a rene
gate from the National Guard of Yu
catan. The Indians first attacked the
camp 'at Quintana Roo, where they
killed -three women, two men and
wounded three more men. At another
camp they killed two men, two women
and wounded three men.
In Chenchunche the offices and store
rooms of Messrs. Barrios were sacked
and burned. The. hospital was also
burned. Three patients, two men and
a woman, perished. In Cozumena. four
men were killed and seven more
wounded by the Indians. . The Indians
then went to other camps and carried
off fifty-seven men. Whether the lat
ter are in captivity or have been mur
dered is not known.
At Tulum the Indians later attacked
the works of Angeld Revas. They
killed three men, wounded five others
and carrie doff five women as prisoners.
As a result of these attacks the chicle
companies suffered serious losses. Many
buildings were burned. It is said that
military protection had been asked of
the Mexican government before the at
tacks and that the authorities replied
that there was no necessity, as the In
dians were harmless. The chicle cum
is used in chewing gum manufactured
in the Unted States. : -;/ â¢

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 29.â Prince
Peter Sviatopolsk-Mlrsky assumed act
ive direction of the Ministry of the In
terior to-day. It Is already apparent
that there will be almost a clean sweep
of the old Von Plehwe regime. A num
ber of the old lieutenants of the former
Minister have resigned. Both the chief
of the gendarmerie and the Secretary
of State of Finland, which powerful
offices the late Von Plehwe accumu
lated, will be divorced from the Minis
try of the Interior, the new Minister
firmly refusing to have any connection
with the police.
M. Stischinsky, who, as Under Secre
tary of State and Director of the Land
Department, acted in an advisory ca
pacity in dealing .with the Zemstvos.
will, it is understood, be appointed Sec
retary of State for Finland. He Is dis
tinctly a man of moderate views. Gen
eral Ridzevsky. it is > also believed, will
be chosen chief of the gendarmerie,
which will become an independent de
partment. Ridzevsky has just resigned
the important position of chief secre
tary of the Ministry of the Imperial
Household in order to be able to ac
cept the position of chief of the gen
darmerie.
The speech of Prince Sviatopolsk-
Mirsky upon receiving the officials of
the Ministry of the Interior to-day Is
bound to produce a deep impression in
Russia and be interpreted as the har
binger of a mild and broad regime. It
has a ring which will be welcomed by
the liberals. While not going into de
tails, it practically reiterates what the
Minister said to the press at Vilna on
September 23 about the! Emperor's
manifesto furnishing the guiding spirit
of his administration. The following
words are considered to be a direct ap
peal to the people, who have trust In
his regime:
"It is my deep conviction that the
fruitfulness of the work of the Gov
ernment is based upon the sincere good
will and sincere confidence which knits
Its relation to the social class, the insti
tutions and the people in general."

ASTORIA, Or., Sept. 29. â The
Oriental liner Arabia of the Portland-
Asiatic line arrived in Portland to
day from Far Eastern points. The
Arabia was captured by the Russian
Vladivostok squadron on July 22, 100
miles north of Yokohama.
The cruiser Gromoboi brought the
Arabia to a stop and three or four
hundred men boarded her. The Arabia
was taken to Vladivostok, where 65,000
sacks of flour were removed from her,
35,000 sacks being left on board. The
Arabia also had on board ninety flat
cars, which the Russians threw into
the sea. They washed ashore along
the beach, where they were rotting
when the liner was finally released.
"We were at Vladivostok for twenty
eight days," said Captain Bahle, "and
there met the crews of several cap
tured .vessels. The Rossia and Gromo
boi were at Vladivostok while the
Arabia was there. I counted twenty
six gaping holes in the Rossia. All of
them were, near the water line."

LONDON. Sept. 30. â Telegraphing
from Newchwang September 29, the
Dally Mall's correspondent says:
"The main force of the Russian
army has retired to the north of Muk
den. Strong bodies of troops have
been thrown out to defend both flanks
and the southern approaches to the
city have been carefully mined. The
indications are that no serious attempt
will be made to hold Mukden."
_The Japanese attacked Da Pass,
which was occupied by the troops of
Generals Mistchenko and Samsonoff on
September 24, but according to dis
patches from Harbin were twice re
pulsed.
Da Pass, or Ta Pass, meaning great
pass, is situated about forty-five miles
southeast of Mukden and about the
same distance northeast of Llaoyang.
It is about twenty-five miles south of
the Hun River.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 29.â A
feeling of uneasiness aroused here,
owing to the lack of definite news from
Port Arthur and General Kuropatkln,
Is growing rapidly. "What adds to the
tension Is the fact that all reports
coming in are of' an unfavorable na
ture. Thus it is reported that enor
mous bands of Hunghuses, well
equipped, are only awaiting the mo
ment when General Kuropatkln is en
gaged to work havoc on his rear, while
the Chinese have developed an organ
ized night and day spy service in favor
of the Japanese. The spy services ex
tend even to Port Arthur, whence every
movement of the ships Is forthwith re
ported to the Japanese. The latter have
so perfected their blockade that not
even a junk can pass. While reinforced
by all the ships that can possibly be
placed at his disposal, Admiral Togo
has taken measures to prevent the en
emy's fleet from escaping even to neu
tral ports. It is stated to-night that
the Japanese have countermined Port
Arthur and annihilated a thousand
Russians.
Such ar,e some of the disquieting ru
mors which now are depressing the
public. The Bourse was very weak to
day. Reports which have been pub
lished in some papers to the effect that
General Kuropatkin has been instruct
ed to give battle at Mukden are un
true. A further j contest, however, is
unlikely.
The absence of Emperor Nicholas,
who has gone to Odessa, Is causing an
even greater dearth of official news
from the front than has been experi
enced heretofore.
Communication with Mukden has
been practically suspended, and St. Pe
tersburg is therefore suffering another
period of anxiety and suspense, just
when the intimation had been given
that important developments were im
minent between the armies of General
Kuropatkin and Field Marshal Oyama.
Port Arthur is more, isolated than
ever, and the only news from that
place comes by way of Vladivostok.
Sept. 29. â Chancellor Von Buelow, in
an interview printed in the Frank
furter Zeltung to-day, relative to the
recent visit of Signor Gioletti, the Ital
ian Premier to the chancellor at Horn
burg, is quoted as saying It was alto
gether personal and that it was not
announced in advance in order to
avoid premature speculations. As for
their having discussed mediation in
the Far Eastern waters, such a thing
was excluded from consideration by
the knowledge that neither Russia nor
Japan desired mediation.

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 29.â While
considerable public, interest has been
aroused by the reports that President
Roosevelt is sounding the powers as to
the advisability of calling another
peace conference at The Hague, no
intimation of such a purpose has yet
been officially conveyed to Russia,
either through Embassador Cassini or
Embassador McCbrmick. In official
circles the proposition is not considered
to, be exactly opportune. v
The Russian Government naturally
is greatly interested in the tribunal
which owes its existence to Emperor
Nicholas* initiative and under ordinary
circumstances would welcome anything
ta forward its aims, but it is pointed
out that during the war it would be
hardly considered with favor. The
neutral powers would, of course, de
sire to limit the activity of the bellig
erents.
Russia admits that there are many
questions growing out of the war in
the Far East which it would profit all
the powers to definitely settle, and she
is in favor of a conference at the close
of the war. "v
The Kevosti, in a bitterly sarcastic
editorial, refers to the conference of
the Institute of International Law,
which closed at Edinburgh yesterday,
and to the proposal from the United
States to reassemble The Hague Con
ference. The paper declares that in
ternational law Is a polite myth, under
cover of which the strongest nation
takes what it wants without regard
for its opponent's rights and feelings,
and says there is not a tenet in the
so called code which has not been
broken whenever it suited the conveni
ence of some nation able to defy it. The
only nations ever appealing to the In
ternational code, the editorial asserts,
are too weak to stand up for their de
mands and they have always found
that the law was administered by the
strong arm of the most powerful na
tion always fixing the interpretation
before the court. \ â¢ v

with Alfonso on the subject, and after
going over the matter thoroughly In

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 29.â News
has been received here from Mukden
to the effect that the Japanese have
at last begun the offensive. They have
captured Da Pass, \ and are pressing
on General Kuropatkin's left flank. The
War Office is unable to confirm this
officially, â¢ because Kuropatkin's dis
patches are following the Emperor, but
the the press is informed by the gen
eral staff that all indications point to
the nqws being correct. It is believed
the Russians abandoned Da Pass with
out serious . resistance. Several other
passes of the Da range, eastward of
Bentsiaputze (twenty miles southeast
of Mukden), are also i\the hands of the
Japanese.
Kuropatkln is evidently drawingf in
his forces to the less mountainous coun
try northwestward, where he may de
cide to give battle. In the meanwhile
sharp fighting is regarded as imminent
southeast of Mukden, whence the Jap
anese are expected to deliver their main
attack, the flank movement from the
west being of secondary Importance.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY. SEPTEMBER 30, 190*.
There continues a dearth of news from the armies In the Par
East. Reports from Russian sources tell 1 of terrible ravages by dis
ease In the Japanese armies. The Llao river Is said to have been
dammed abreast of Uaoyang In order that the flooded country may
protect the left flank of the Japanese arniy threatening Mukden. In
St. Petersburg it seems to be the expectation * that General Kuro
patkin will not make a stubborn fight to hold Mukden. Vladivos
tok has heard that the Port Arthur sarrison is confident of being
able to hold out at least three months longer. Another stroke of
ill-fortune has befallen the Russian navy in an accident to the
cruiser Oreg, which was ordered to pc ready about this time for
sea with other vessels of the Baltic Squadron. Repairs to the Orcgf
will probably detain her at Cronstadt for six weeks.

That the Webster-street and Park
Railroad had become a part of the
consolidated system was first given
credence when the construction de
partment of the transit company was
put at work building the new line. At
that time the original projectors re
lused to say definitely that absorp
tion was contemplated, but it was ad
mitted that the Webster-street road
would be operated under agreements
with the Transit Consolidated. The
new corporation now open!}" : takes
over the road and again comrol3
every street car line in the ' city of
Oakland.
Directors of the new company are
practically the same as those which
controlled its predecessor. They are
ti C. Havens. E. A. Heron, W. F.
Kelly, S. J. TayV>r. W. H. Martin,
George Sterlinp and J. Q. Brown.
The consolidation includes all of
thf transit company's lines and the
nÂ«w road, which is nearing comple
tion. The Webster-street and Park
Railroad was incorporated under a
franchise granted to J. Ii. Macdonald.
It was originally controlled by Edson
Adams. The line extends from Web
eter and Fourteenth streets, through
Fourteenth to Webster, to Boulevard
terrace and across the Adams Paint
property, touching a terminus near
the junction of Pleasant Valley ave-
Eue and Lake Shore avenue. It is in
tended to give outlet to the large dis
trict included within the Adams es
tate holdings north of Lake Merritt
and contiguous lands in that vicinity.
Should the fc'ather property ever, be
come a public park this line would
control the travel to that location.
The consolidation means that the
new line, whlcZ&will be ready for op
t ration early in October, will be in
cluded within the transfer arrange
ments of the old company. This will
enable travelers from all parts of the
city to reach conveniently the upper
shores of Lake Merritt. .-, V,

The Oakland Transit Consolidated
to-day absorbed the new Webster
street and P:irk Railroad and reor
ganized the new corporation under
the title of th.> Oakland Traction Con
solidated, with a capital stock of
$7,0&0,000. Articles of incorporation
were filed this afternoon with the
County Clerk.

"Guilty as charged" was thÂ© verdict
rendered this afternoon * by a jury In
Judge Hall's court, which had before it
evidence in the case of "Walter O'Gara,
a youth accused of perjury. Five hours
were spent by counsel in introducing
evidence yesterday, and nearly as much,
time was taken by lawyers to-day In
making their arguments, but the jury
required only ten minutes In which to
frame a verdict.
O'Gara was charged with misrepre
senting his wife's age when he pro
cured a marriage license from Deputy
County Clerk Hanley several month*
ago. He. brought Miss Mary Dunning
from San Francisco to this city, and
swore that she was 18 years of , age.
contrary to the fact. His defense was
that he supposed the girl to be of age.
Hev was arrested a month -after the
marriage. . The bride's parents vio
lently opposed the match.
O'Gara was obliged to admit on the
witness stand that he had once been
convicted of a felony. Four years ago
he was sentenced to a term in San
Quentin. The parents of Ella Jessie,
a young girl of Alameda, charged him
with a serious offense, and his convic
tion followed. He was out on parole
when he met and married Mary Dun
ning.
According to the story Carter told
Justice Edgar, Mrs. Hardigan, who is
a dressmaker, came over from her
home at Seventeenth and Folsom
streets, San Francisco, yesterday ' to
wreak vengeance for some fancied in
sult. On her way down the street Mrs.
Hardigan filled her apron - full of
stones, evidently preparing for a bom
bardment When she got In front of
the Carter home she began to fling her
ammunition vigorously.
That Mrs. Hardigan is the one
woman who can throw a stone straight
Carter is willing to declare on his oath.
He says every stone she hurled hit a
window, with the result that in a lit
tle while there were no more panes in
the front windows of the house. It
was useless to try to prevent* the de
struction and the bombardment con
tinued until the Hardigan rock supply
was exhausted.
Following a family quarrel that re
sulted In the smashing of all the win
dows on the front of his house, Charles
C. Carter of 1622 Todd street swore to
a complaint to-day before Justice of
the Peace Edgar charging his sister
in-law, Airs. Mary Hardlgan, with ma
licious mischief. Mrs. Hardigan disap
peared after the row, but a constable
is on her trail and he expects soon to
have her in the clutches of the law.

The third Eucharistic Congress of the Unit
ed States, having in view recent events In
France affecting religion and liberty, decides
to put itself on record by the following resolu
tions: .
NEW YORK, Sept. 29.â More than a
thousand Roman Catholic ecclesiasts
from all parts of the country, attend
ing as delegates the third general Eu
charistic Congress, were present .to-day
at St: Patrick's Cathedral. The con
gress, without a dissenting voice,
adopted the following:
BOSTON, Sept. 29.â After allowing
time "for the commuidations in "the
Phelps-Gurney case to reach Washing
ton, Governor Bates to-day made pub
lic previous letters bearing on the sub
ject. Tho Governor Informed the State
Department that the Judgment against
j Third Secretary Gurney of the British
Embassy has been vacated and the
fines imposed remitted. He says that
Judge Phelps had expressed regret -to
the secretary by letter, a copy of which
he forwarded together with a f state
ment by Judge Phelps. Governor Bates
suggests that the attention of the Brit
ish Embassador be called to the breach
; ol the laws of Massachusetts under the
belief that the Emba&sador will take
such action as the case may demand.
The Governor also expresses regret
that want of knowledge of the law has
resulted in an error of judicial author
ity in Massachusetts, and expresses
the hope that the statement of regret
by Judge Phelps may be recognized as
a conclusive disapproval of any Inten
tion of Massachusetts courts to Ignore
International law.
The statement of Justice Phelps is an
elaboration of the facts in the case
briefly set forth in the letter of Gov
ernor Bates to the State Department.
The statements made by Gurney be
fore the court, Justice ' Phelps says,
were of such character, as to appear to
be a manifest and intentional defiance
of judicial authority and to be, as he
believed and found, in contempt - of
court. He proceeded, he said, in ignor
ance of the usages of international /IaV
and of the provision of the Federal
statutes, the question never before
having come before the court, nor was
it so presented to him as to advise him
of his error in? the premises. The ac
tion of the court, Justice Phelps de
clares, was inspired wholly and abso
lutely by a purpose to enforce the lavÂ»,
and * for the protection of human lite
endangered by the conduct of Gurney
as established by the evidence present
ed to him. The letter* of Judge Phelos
lo Third Secretary Gurney follows:

Hon Hush Gurney. Third Secretary to His
Britannic Majesty, Lenox,- Mass. â Sir: As
Justice â¢ of the Lee Police Court, I find occa

prised of this error and seeking to make 'all
possible reparation therefor, the court has va
cated â¢ and Â¦ annulled all proceedings taken In
the . matter of the complaint against yourself
and the erroneous Judgment entered thereon.
I- beg' further, to "express my profound per
sonal regret that I shduld . have been, -without

of a day or two. When the Governor's
letter is thus supplemented the State
Department will prepare a communica
tion to the British Embassador, em
bodying therein only so much of Gov
ernor Bates' report as it may deem
expedient. This will be in the nature
of a reply to the complaint made by
Mr. Raikes, the* British Secretary of
Embassy, and while expressing regret
at the occurrence, will present a sober
statement of facts and the testimony
adduced to show that Secretary Gur
ney did violate the local laws.
LENOX, Mass., Sept. 29.â Sir Morti
mer Dufand, the British Embassadox.
said to-nifeht that he had not received
from Washington the communication
sent to the State Department by Gov
ernor Bates concerning the Gurney
case. The F.mbaasador declined to
make any statement or comment on
the matter in the absence of the official
correspondence. Ue expects to receive
the documents to-morrow morning, at
which time he will probably give out a
statement.

PERU'S FORTUNE
AT HIGH TIDE
That night there was Joy in police
quarters, while Rocchigiani, unsuspect
ing, planned his future with his fiancee.
The next evening also found him en
gaged ln v the same pleasant occupation,
which was so engrossing that they did
not hear a ring at the front door bell.
The courtship was suddenly interrupt
ed by a gruff voice saying, "I arrest
you in the name of the law." Enrico
jumped as though shot, and the police,
thinking he was trying to escape,
seized him, whereupon a struggle en
sued, while his fiancee fainted.
Signorina Bianci Mascagnl, to whom
Rocchigiani was engaged, was a* poor
spirited creature. "Don't arrest. me,
don't arrest me," she whimpered. "I
know nothing," was her continual cry,
until, hard pressed, she confessed that
her lover had given her $3000, which
was In the bank, a fact that the police
had never suspected.
ThÂ» triumphant authorities ran to the
jail, and bursting into Rocchiffiani's
cell, cried, "We have you now. How
about the $3000 you handed over to
Signorina Mascagnl?" With a gesture,
of despair Rocchigiani hid his face in
his hands, refusing to answer any
questions. '. .
The next morning when the guard
opened the door of the photographer's
cell, he stumbled against a heavy ob
ject, which swung out as he touched
it. The stark form' Of. Rocchigiani,
clad only in his night clothes,, hung
from a hook over ! the door,- with | his
sheet as a rope. In his convulsively
closed fingers was a slip of paper, on
which he had laboriously written with
a burnt match: "I am Innocent. Search
for the guilty and when you find. them
you will not touch them,. they are too
high. I die because a woman has.be
trayed me." . , r ; V';-i i
Enrico Rocchigiani, the photographer,
had also, like Father Castelli, been
showing too much money. Until not
long ago he could scarcely make a liv
ing, when suddenlyâ as it seemedâ he
had plenty of means and talked of
marrying. Being enterprising, he
brought out a postcard of the stolen
cope and gained considerably by it. One
fell into the hands of the police and a
bright officer at once exclaimed: "But
how is that! The cope had only been
photographed once before it disappear
ed and this is not a reproduction of
that picture, so the cope must have
been photographed after It was stolen!"
DIES BY HIS OWN HAND.
Raffaele left he said, "I am innocent,
never believe anything else and I will
live to prove it. Keep up heart and be
lieve in me." The sister, in a delicate
condition, fell into convulsions.
Father Raffaele at first abandoned
himself to despair In his prison cell, but
his religic-n came to his aid and in the
morning he was calmer. Some days
later he was released "for want of suffi
cient evidence." but he is changed past
recognition. An old man at twenty
eight, he feels himself under a ban and
his only desire is to go among strangers
who do not kr*ow his story.

"But why?. Of what am I accused?"
"Of knowing more than you ought
about the cope."
The scene that followed was uncom
monly painful. To be even accused of
crime Is considered a mortal disgrace
by the Castelli family. At last the
â¢Â¦".irbineers, and the young priest him
self, cut the scene short as the only
thing to do and the dungeon door closed
for the first time on a CastellL As Don
The Italian police were at once roused
by the news from England and, follow
ing ittle clews, fastened their suspi
ciotih on two persons. Father Kaffaele
Cartelli. who, at the time of the steal
ing, belonged to the Cathedral of As
c-oli. and Enrico Rocchigiani, a photog
rapher of Vc-lterra. The priest was ac
cused bemuse he seemed to have been
Requiring property which the police
thought he should be too poor to" pay
for.
The CaFtelli family is exceptionally
united and consists of a married sister,
Don Raffaele ar.d a younger brother.
One evening, recently, they were all
tranquilly sitting, enjoying the evening
nir, when suddenly the tramp, tramp
of an armed pquad was heard in the
road. Don Raffaele turned to his sister
laughingly and said, "If one had some
thing on his conscience how that sound
would make his heart beat." He had
no sooner finished speaking than eight
carbineers, with an officer, came out of
the gloom and stopped at the gate.
They came silently up to the group and
surrounded the young priest.

ALAMEDA,* Sept- 29. â There is a
movement under way in which the
Alameda Boating Club is interested to
form an association exclusively for thfc
rowing organizations of the Pacific
Coast, most of which are affiliated
with the Pacific Athletic Association*
Last night a meeting was held at the
Quarters of the Dolphin Rowing Club
in San Francisco and the project was
discussed. Representatives were pres
ent from the Alameda Boating Club,
the Ariel Rowing Club, and the Dol
phin Rowing Club. Those appearing
for the local oarsmen's organization
were Frank E. Browning. E. B. Thorn
ing, W. S. Donnelly, Harry Nelson and
George Tupper.
There Is an impression among the
members of the various rowing clubs
across the bay that the aquatic sport
is not being accorded the attention by
the Pacific Athletic Association that
its popularity warrants and . that it
would be to the advantage of the
clubs to draw out of that organization
and act together.
It was decided last night to send
invitations to the rowing organizations
of Stockton, San Diego,' Portland,
Vallejo and other cities to ascertain
if they would be willing to Join an
association given over exclusively 'Â¦' to
rowing. Another meeting to further
consider the*proposition of amalgama
tion will . be held .at the. quarters of
the Dolphins on October 10.

TACOMA, Sept. 29. â The game
dragged out for more than two and a
half hours to-day, but was close and
exciting. Manager Russ Hall and #
Doyle were ordered to the bench for
disputing Brown's decisions. SL Vrain
started to pitch, but six hits and six
runs put him to the bad. Thomas,
while wild, was effective until the
ninth, when C. Hall made a home
run. Van Haltren and Mohler were
passed, advancing on Blankenship's
sacrifice and scoring on Delehanty's
single. ~ Â¦
With the score tied Eagan drew a
pass in the ninth. Casey hit one on
the right line, which Seattle claimed
was foul, but Brown allowed It as a
two-bagger. Eagan scored when Me-
Laughlin bunted. With Taconia five
runs behind, Eagan hit a home run
in the fifth, scoring three. Two tallied
In the sixth on Casey's single. Mc-
Laughlin's triple and an out. In the
seventh Delehanty's misplay, three
hits, a base on balls and Seattle's poor
team work allowed Tacoma to score
three more. Score:

>"EW YOttK JUMPS INTO
\ THE LEAD ONCE AGAIN
The football teams representing the
High Schools on this side of the bay
are' more evenly matcBed than in recent
years and the struggle for the cham
pionship is an interesting one. Of the
five teams in this sub-league four are
evenly matched. Lick and Polytechnic
appear to be the strongest teams, but
they will have no easy time disposing
of Mission and Lowell High. Wii
raerding, although the heaviest team
in the league, seems outclassed.
In the opening game Polytechnic
beat ..Lowell by a score of 10-0. Since
Lthen the Sutter-street boys have come
V> 'the' front and have been playins
good football. Last Saturday they beat
?Wilmerding 10-0 and when Lick meets
them they will have no walkover.
It Is difficult to get a line on Mis
sion High. They beat Wllmerdin^
easily on the opening day of the season,
but have not played a game since.
Coach Gaffey has had them out every
afternoon for practice.
Polytechnic and Mission will meet
this afternoon and a good game will
undoubtedly result. Polytechnic Is con
fident-of winning, but the Mission bova
may spring a surprise. Polytechnic
wilt line up almost the same as in the
game with Lick last Saturday. An
derson will take Reardon's place at left
guard, while the latter will be switched
to right tackle. Garibaldi will play the
other tackle. Mission will have the
same team that piled up a 16-0 score
against Wilberding. The teams will
line up as follows this afternoon:
Polytechnic. Position. Mission.

The Lick-Lowell game. which is sched
uled for to-morrow morning, will be "a
hard-fought contest. There is always
considerable rivalry between these two
schools and Lowell is determined to
win. Lick, of course, feels confident
of winning owing to the fact that Poly
technic scored twice on Lowell and
Lick held "Poly" down to a 0-0 score. â¢
Polytechnic and Lick will play oft
their tie game next Tuesday afternoon.
The contest this time will be on a drv
field, where it will be possible to kick
field goals. In the last game the teams
playedon an improvised field, where
there were no goal posts. Lick was
close enough on three or four differ
ent occasions to try for coal and
"Poly" was once within kickine dis
tance. The greatest game of the sea
son will result when these two teams
meet on Tuesday. Lick and Lowell will
face each other as follows to-morrow

Santa Clara Eleven Wins.
SAX JOSE. Sept. 29.â The Santa
Clara College eleven defeated the Fort
Miley team of San Francisco at foot
ball this afternoon at Santa Clara t<y
the score of 10 to 0. The defense work
of the college backs and the indi
vidual work of the soldiers were fea
tures of the game. A fast, snappy
game was played.
; Parke Wilson experienced the ex- !
treme pleasure at Recreation Park yes
terday of receiving those elusive slants
which his old employe used to shoot at
him. Perhaps the sensaUon of doing
this, unusual stunt was too oppressive
for Mr. Wilson, or it may have been
that he did not like the job. At any
rate he played some pretty bad base
ball. As for. Mr." Barber, he possibly
felt a feeling, of awe in the presence
of his old boBS, for he was never so bad
in many moons. Score: Los Angeles 6,
San FranciBco 1. ,
'Twas a poor game of ball for the
fans ,< to behold. The Seals playÂ§d
like youths fresh from the bushes.
They could not field at all when the
critical moment was at hand and most
of their hits counted for naught. Al
though they outbatted the southern
ers, only one run arrived while the
former accumulated six. Every one
admitted the performance was a
marked reversal of form and that
Harris' gang was awful.
The .Angels began to do business in
the "Third when Ross singled and Bar
ber hurled Spies' drive away over Van
Buren's head, scoring Ross and letting
the venerable Heine pull up at third.
Flood's double cushion swat put him
safely over the jumps. It was broken
up for fair in the fifth, when the
Angels landed for a bunch of hits and
Mr. Wilson developed such a strong*
arm that he hurled the ball wilder than
any other catcher was aver known to
hurl it. "
San Francisco's lone little run came
about in the eighth when Hildebrand
doubled and Captain lrwin saved the
disgrace of a shutout by swinging
through with a single.' The score:

After a brisk rub down he mounted
the scales' and tipped the beam at ex
actly 136V6 pounds.
After nearly three weeks of hard
training near San Rafael, Joe Gans is.
in fine condition for his meeting with
Walcott. Gans has work'ed long and
faithfully for this battle, and feels
confident of lowering the colors of the
welterweight champion.
He was* on the road early yesterday,
and took a ten-mile .spin. A few
rounds with the punching bag in the
afternoon concluded his long spell of
hard training. Â¦Â»
"Gans and Hereford thought I would
have to weaken myself to make 141
pounds, but I've fooled them, and what
is more I'm going to give Gans the
worst beating he ever got since he has
been in the business." .
GANS IN GOOD CONDITION.
Walcott has finished his training: for
his corltest with Gans. With the excep
tion of a run on the road this morn
ing as a pipe opener he will do noth
ing until he gets into the ring. Jo'e
worked like a Trojan yesterday and
succeeded in gettinp bis weight down
to 138 pounds, a notch he was anxious
to reach.
He put in a fairly hard day yester
day, going for a long run on the road
in the morning and working in the
gymnasium in the afternoon. He util
ized all the apparatus, but handled the
punching bag gingerly. He did.no box
ing for fear of injuring his hands.
The hot weather of the past two days
has been welcome to Walcott, as it has
enabled him to take off weight, without
working so hard as to be weak after
ward,. Joe is well under the weight
now arid after drying out' he will
hardly scale 140 pounds, which is his
fighting weight. Walcott is confident
he will capture the long .end of the
purse. After his work yesterday he
said: ., â¢ t
Spider Kelly will direct Walcott's
fighting while Hereford will have
charge of Gans 1 corner. *'
Jimmy Britt said yesterday that he
will fight Gans after his meeting: with
Young Corbett if the lightweight cham
pion, wins to-night. Britt has been pol
ishing up his oratory and will Rive it
an airing to-night
WALCOTT IS CONFIDENT.
He will be ably assisted in this by
the spectators in the gallery. If the
boxes are not trying they will be the
first to observe it and they are always
quick to make known their observa
tions, r
There has been a change in the . ar
rangements regarding the prelimina
ries. There will be but one. that "be
tween Mike (Twin) Sullivan of Bosfoa
and Joe Angeli. Sullivan comes with
a big reputation. He is tall and -thin
but shapely and has a good left hand.
Angeli is a recent graduate from 'the
amateur ranks. He is a game, hard
hitting fighter. These two. will enter
the ring promptly at 8:30. As they, leave
a pair of scales will be put. in. Wal
cott, with his customary yawn, will
be in readiness for the weight test.
There will be but little delay after
that.- -
Jack Welch, who will referee to
night's fight, issued a statement yes
terday. V In it he says both boxers are
in the best of condition, and that the
spectators will see a great contest. The
referee will protect the public if he sees
anything approaching' collusion be
tween the boxers. " â¢ Â¦ â¢/ *
1 â¢ Â¦â¢ Â¦ . Â¦Â¦ Â¦
* What may prove the last* fight, held
here, and -what will undoubtedly- be
one of the most sensational in the his
i tory ; of the ring, will be decided" to
; night in Woodward's Pavilion,
The principals will be Joe Gana,' the
i lightweight champion of the world, and
Joe Walcott, the welter-weight cham
pion. As Walcott won the chanjpioh
ship at 142 pounds, ; and as the j men. are
to fight at 141 pounds, Walcptt claims
| the title is not involved. It wouid-'npt
make him feel half so badly to lose the
title, however, as it would to be de
Â¦ feated by Gans. They have been rivals
j for years, and much bitterness will un
doubtedly be shown to-night in .the
ring. . ;-
The bettors have been so well divided
that the betting closed last night at
even money. The cleverest judges of
i price were unable to say what turn
the odds would take to-day. -
A p6ol of $500 was made up in Oak
land to bet on Walcott, and it was
quickly snapped up, Zick Abrams tak
ing the Gans end. In the early evening
there was a lot of Gans money in sighf,
but this was all absorbed by the fol
lowers of Walcott. The volume of bet
ting will not be large, as Walcott is al
ways an uncertain quantity in the
ring. From all appearances he will be
there to-night to do his best, as he
knows there will come a day., when he
must seek another .occupation. â¢
ItEFEHEE WELCH'S STATEMENT.
By arrangement with the Treasury
Department, all the foreign cars entered
for the race were, it is declared by the
consignees, to have been admitted duty
free on condition that they were to t>e
deported within ninety days. Howeve'r.
the machines were appraised 'at $10,600
each and the Customs-house ' officials
announced that they would be held un
till, the full sum had been paid. The
hitch occurred because of the fact that
the shippers failed to declare their pur
pose when consigning the machines so
they entered this port in the same cat
egory as machines that are brought
over to be sold.
The cars are favorites for the Â¦Van
derbilt race, three of them being . en
tered for that event and the fourth be
ing a substitute. A special representa
tive was sent to Washington to inter
cede with the Treasury Department,
but failed, and it is likely that only
one of the automobiles will be taken
from the Customs-house for the race.
NEW YORK, Sept. 29.â Four French
automobiles brought here from Paris to
compete in the Vanderbilt cup race on
Long Island.. October 8 are held
at the Customs-house, pending the pay
ment of duties amounting to $18,000.
The cars of ninety horse power each,

GRAVESEND, Sept. 29. â For fc
stake such as the Ocean View handi
cap, worth $2475 to the winner, it is
surprising so small a field accepted the
weights to-day and went to the post.
This may be due to the fact that R.
T. Wilson's Dolly Spanker, at 112
pounds, looked a sure winner. As the
result showed, the bookmakers were
liberal when they asked the public to
lay them only 10 to 7.
Dolly Spanker is better than he ever
was. While I^eonidns was in the lead
lor six or more furl-ings, it was mere
ly on sufteranee. Whtn Redfern got
ready to go to the front with Wilson's
irelding the race was ail over. Dolly
Spanker had little to beat in Leonidas,
Mineola and Ostrich, but he did it in
such style as to arouse enthusiasm.
The first mile of the one and a six
teenth mile course was run in 1:40 3-5,
which was a good deal faster than Co
lonial Girl was required to run her
mile in the race for which she proved
an easy winner.

CHICAGO, Sept. 29. â Big Ben made
pood field look cheap to-day in the
third and feature event' of the Worth
card. With the track worse than a
Quagmire, it took a horse with the en
durance of a locomotive to negotiate
the going. Big Ben answered all the
requirements, which enabled him to
win as he pleased. Jockey Prior al
lowed Nannie Hodge to set the early
pace, being content with placing Big
Ben in second position to the stretch
turn. Here he simply cantered to>tie
front, taking a lead of five lengths.
From there to the wire he only jogged
along and won by five lengths with
the boy pulling him up. He had hard
ly gone twenty "yards beyond the

Attorney Woodworth Returns.
United States District Attorney
Marshall B. Woodworth returned yes
terday after a three weeks' trip to the
Mono County mountains on official
business.
My conclusion upon this point Is that the
llbelitnts are only entitled to recover as dam
ages one-half tire | value of tbe use of the
Cleveland while she was undergoing repairs. A
decree will bo entered In favor of llbelants tot
damagen and costs and the case referred to
United States Commissioner Morse to ascertain
and report the damage sustained.
The llbelants are clearly entitled to recover
the reasonable expense incurred by them In
securing a new rating of the Cleveland In thÂ«
American Record and Bureau Verltas and also
dockage expense and wages of watchman" while
the steamer was necessarily detained for thÂ«
purpose of being repaired. â¢ â¢ Â¦ â¢
The llbelants . are not entitled to recover ae
damages the amount which the Cleveland prob
ably would have earned If she had made the
trip to Seattle. That trip was voluntarily
abandoned by them In order that they might
eecure thÂ« benefits of the Alaska char
ter. â¢ â¢ â¢
! United States District Judge de
Haven yesterday handed out an opin
ion in favor of the libelant in the case

Cleveland while the Cleveland was ly
ing at Mission pier on May 27, 1898. 3 It
waa not disputed that the collision was
the fault of the Sequoia, and the only
issue before the court was the measure
of damages. .The following are ex

In regard to the statistics on the cost,'
operation and value of street sweepers
and street sweeping contracts, there
appeared before the committee, of
which Supervisor Rock was chairman,
several representatives of local ma
chinery companies.
George L. Belcher/ vice president of
the Henshaw-Bulkley Machinery Com
pany, gave some valuable estimates
to the committee on the cost of oper
ating street sweepers, the relative value
of various sweepers in regard to size
of the brush. Among other things he
said he thought Jfa day sufficient for
the renovating of brushes on machines,
figuring that the brushes lasted ten
days and that the rattan bristles cost
fifteen cents. He closed his statements
by offering to sell to the city a nine
foot brush machine at $335, and an ex
tra brush at $30.
A representative of the Studebaker
Company agreed to furnish a seven
foot brush machine to the city at $320
net. Gray Brothers' machines were
offered at $366 05.
From, the statements of J. B.. Cow
den, superintendent of street sweep
ing, it was learned that there are thirty
more men on the payroll than there
are machines. Owing to this no man
in the service could work more than
four days in the week. He also said
there were no other men in his depart
ment who were from the cjvil service
besides himself.
\ The decision of the committee was to
pass a resolution directing the Board
of Works to render requisitions for
purchases and supplies to the Board
of Supervisors, according to the pro
visions of the charter. The committee
then adjourned to meet Monday at
11:30 o'clock.
The ultimate-decision of the commit
tee was to continue the investigation of
the Yorke inquiry until Monday, when
a decision would be reached. .
WILL DECIDE MONDAY.
After Inspector Boone had left the
-stand'.F. M, Yorke was called upon to
testify^ At the first question by Bran
denstetn as .to who- were the organizers
of F. M.^pfbrke & Company Yorke re
fused to reply. After twij more ques
tions- Mr. Yorke arose hastily and said
that he objected to being questioned
as to his personal affaire. He also ex
pressed regret-at losing his temper at
the last meeting. of the committee and
thanked the members fpr their forbear
ance, but positively refused .to
answer personal questions. He .was
somewhat mollified by Brandenstein's
statement that the committee merely
required yes or no.
During Yorke's- testimony it' was,
shown that the F. M. Yorke Company*
received the , contract from the city
on July 14, while the-company was in
'corporated on the 19th of "July. This
Yorke explained by saying that the
contract, which was signed F. M.
Yorke & Company, was entered into
by the firm of F. M. Yorke & Company,
which consisted at that time of Yorke
and P. M. Gopchevitch. It was' Uso
brought, out that Yorke & Company's
plant was not purchased until after the.
contract was awarded.
% The next witness to testify before. the
committee was Leonard S. Wood, a
clerk in the Board of Works depart
ment. When questioned as to his "O.
K." on the Yorke bills he said that
his "O. K." merely referred to the com
puting of the amounts, that he received
those amounts from the inspector, W.
S. Boone, and admitted that he had no
means of verifying the figures. Â¦'_,'
The joint committee of the Board of
Supervisors on finance and streets met
yesterday afternoon and continued the
Investigation of the inquiry into the
bills rendered, by F. M. Yorke '& Com
pany for street paving, and estimates
by local merchants on the cost of op
eration of street sweepers.
The first witness called, Supervisor
Brandenstein acting as chairman, was
W. -R. Boone, the inspector', charged
with looking after the work done by
the contractors 5f bituminous pave
ment. -During the inquiry, it was de
veloped that the small note book kept
by Inspector Boone was the city's si>le
record of the amount of work done by
the. contractors up to the time the total
amounts were transcribed into the
books of the Board of Public Works.
Later Morri3 Levy, secretary of the
Board of Works, testified that he took
the "O. K," of the bookkeeper, Leon
ard S. Leavy, as to the correctness of
the amounts on the -bills rendered by
F. M. Yorke & Company against the
city. When asked by Supervisor Bran
denstein how he knew the amounts
were correct, Levy said that he took
the inspector's word -for it.
questioning developed the fact that
Secretary Levyh'ad made no verifica
tion of the books k>t the Works Board,
whereupon .he was* advised by Bran
denstein that it was his duty to veri
fy them. '_ <. '

The Board of Sunervlsors was peti
tioned .to enact an ordinance prohibit
ing the conveyance of soiled- clothes in

as it is a menance to health.
The board requested the Supervisors
to appoint. Doctors Regensberger, Blue,
Trotter' and -O'Neill special police offi
cers with power to arrest those who
violate sanitary laws. \$
Dr. C. A: Glover was appointed emer

ises should not be vacated.
Rules .were adopted for the govern
ment of applicants for certificates as
master plumbers which provide that
applicants .taking two examinations
and failing to pass must' wait for six
months before taking another. Â¦
Ragan in his report directs .attention
to the fact "that infant' "and '.child mor
tality has decreased" thirty per.cent in
the. last three months and contagious
diseases are on the decline. This con
dition he attributes to school and dairy
inspection'. ..-. - " . '.,
Ragan also calls attention to the in
tention of the board to stop shrimp
catching off Butchertown, under an or
dinance prohibiting it. He also reported
that out of sixty-nine dairies inspected.
eleven only are good, fifteen fair- and
f crty-three poor as to sanitary condi
tions required by the new ordinance.
Dr. B. M. Hinkle waa granted a leave
of absence for one month.
Health Officer Ragan filed his report
on dairy investigation with the Health
Board yesterday and as a result three
dairies were condemned as being un
sanitary. The dairies condemned are
those of J. Lapachet in San Mateo. his
milk being ordered quarantined; the
depot of ..the Maine Dairy at Tenth
street near Howard,' and the dairy of
Barrilliaa Brothers in South San Fran
cisco,, which was bought from a former
owner, J. Andrea, after it was rated as
filthy by the board. Ra^an recom
mends that the dairy industry should
not be permitted to exist on the penin
sula, as there is no pasture so short a
distance from tide water. Â«

highly privileged persons had obtained them I showed no eagerness to
buy.
"You will find these same pictures selling in Regent-street shops for
one shilling and one and sixpence each," said the proprietor, anxious to
convince me that he was offering me genuine bargains. "You can go and
see for yourself, and if you find that I haven't told you the truth I'll^
make you a present of them." â¢ . ''.}'?Â¦$Â¦

"In San Francisco," I said to him, looking, him square In the eyes,
"there is published a newspaper called The San Francisco Call. On Sun

taining vastly more interesting reading matter. That is sold for 6 cents
âtwopence halfpenny in -your moneyâ and with each paper is given
.one of these pictures that you sell for ninepence."
;' He looked at me compassionately, and said:
"I suppose it is catching over there, and you can't help it, but if you
will excuse me for saying so, sir, I think Americans ought to keep; their
stiff yarns for home consumption. *We can get along very well with
what we turn out 'ourselves In our comic papers."
CONDON, Sept. 2.â At the Direct Art Company's shop in the Strand,
prominently displayed in the window and framed, I. saw to.-day a
picture precisely similar to that which was given away with the
Sunday edition of The San Francisco Call some months ago. It
was the product of an American color print firm, and was entitled "The
Passing Storm." Pretty enough it looked to hang up anywhere and,
being curious to ascertain how such works of art are valued here, I in
quired the price. x
"Only four shillings and sixpence," replied the proprietor, "and I as
sure you, sir, it is cheap at the price." In American money that is equal
"What is the price of It unframed?" I asked.

Editor of The Call^ Regarding pri
mary election frauds you say: "Evi
dence of crime is abundant, but clews
to perpetrators are wholly lacking."
One preventive measure to stop
these frauds is to have enforced strict
ly the law which says election officers
must be chosen from the precincts in
which they reside. It Is the custom to
flagrantly violate this provision and
the "bobtail and ragtag" element from
the slums is in evidence all over town.
Election officers should consist of
clerk3, etc.. who have been employed
in the Registrar's office and on the
precinct registration boards. They
may not remember all the voters in
their precincts, but they can easily
identify Wymans and frauds and
crooks as being other than those they
claim to be when they approach tho
voting booths.

Some Good Recipes.
As is customary at the beginning of
every season, the positive announce
ment Is made that shirt waists* are no
longer fashionable, and that every
skirt must have a waist to match: yet,
strange to say, the shops are full of
the most fascinating designs for shirt
waists, and seamstresses* and dress
makers alike are busy making blouses.
The truth of the matter la that the
shirt waist Is an absolutely essential
garment, and cart no more be dis
pensed with than a coat or shirt. In a
handsome costume It is not so fash
ionable to have a waist of different
material from the skirt; but, none the
less, with the coat and skirt there are
many occasions when a cloth waist â â¢
in fact, one of any material except
ing lace or linen, silk or satin â is
most . uncomfortable to wear under
the coat, and when the smart sepa
rate waist Is the only correct style.
Shirt Waists Still Worn.

npHE man who invented a device by which users of telephones
I might see each other has broken his model into pieces and de
stroyed every plan and specification of his invention. , His reason
is that he, would be cheated out of it anyway! ,It is, a pity that he
had no adviser whom he could trust to secure to him the'advantage
of such a discovery. Inventors are seldom good business people, and
are usually in necessity because they spend -much unrequited time
and effort over their discoveries, and when they make a hit are out
of bread and raiment, , so that their necessities arc taken advantage
of by designing men and they see the profit go to others.
Still, the discoverers of such devices as the sewing machine, the
telephone, the air brake and many other inventions that are how
prime necessities in the business world had their reward. This
proves that an inventor need not be without hope in the world. - This
invention for seeing by telephone has great .possibilities.* The user
of the instrument would gladly look - upon the hello girl who is
*'sassing" him, and she would like to make a snoot at the man who
is swearing at her. Parties engaged in a long and animated con
versation over the wire would be glad to identify the Paul Prys who
take down their phones to listen, and everybody would; like, to see
the fellow who uses the instrument to speak abusively. to some one
whom he dislikes. *
Not long ago a run-on a bank in Oakland was started by a
vicious person by use of the telephone to alarm depositors by lies
about the bank's solvency. The criminal and injurious uses of the
telephone are increasing, and this; destroyed invention jyould,pre
vent or limit them,' It is -to be hoped that the inventor will; think
better 'of it and reconstruct his machine.

NO more significant commentary upon the efficacy of the Demo
cratic propaganda for Filipino self-government has become
manifest than that expressed unconsciously in a recent com
munication from Governor Wright of the Philippines to President
Roosevelt. Therein he states that the very fact of the agitation
for an autonomous government, which has been set in motion by the
I'ilipino plank of the Democratic" platform, has already caused to
appear among the reactionaries and former insurrectos of the Phil
ippines a dangerous spirit of unrest and arrogant self-assurance.
"The effect of this is distinctly injurious," says the Governor.
To the ignorant and only half-tamed mind of the aVerage Filipino
there can be no distinction between the present agitation of the
Democrats and the cnA of the anti-imperialists of the days of mili
tary rule. In the Democratic promise of a freedom untrammeled
and absolute, the lately pacified revolutionary distinguishes naught
but an iteration of the* old protest against any domination on the
part of this Government â a protest which did more to prolong the
war in the Philippines than any single other cause. Between the
"antis of four years ago and the Democrats of 'to-day the power
greedy islander makes no distinction; both strive to give over to his
hands the unfamiliar and glittering plaything, sovereignty, and his
heart is glad within him. .^^
The party which was strongest in its protest against the length
of the war in the Philippinesâ "the war of aggression against a help
less people" â is now fostering the very troubles which that con
flict put an end to by stirring up again the latent lust of the natives
for something to satisfy their reckless vanity. In making an issue of
the Filipino independence question the Democratic party is com
mitting itself, not to a negative policy alone, but to one absolutely
dangerous and destructive. . The flourishing of unrestricted autono
mous government before the eyes of the Filipinos is the deliberate
courting of danger from fires still smoldering.

Turning to* a comparison of Japan's foreign trade with that of
Russia, the results are rather startling. Japan with a population of
40,000,000 in 1903 had a total import and export trade of $250,970,000,
while Russia with 130,000,000 of people had $675,603,125. The Jap
anese furnish therefore twice as much foreign trade per capita as
the Russians. In marine tonnage Japan has steam^nnd sail 1690,581
and Russia 800,334, so that Japan has a far greater tonnage per capita,,
implying greater commercial activity in proportion to her population.
The Japanese imports were $146,625,000; the Russian $278,003,125.
From this it" will be seen that the Japanese trade is worth going
after, and If the French writer is correct as to the advantage of our
geographical situation our command of it is to be sought. We have
more surplus of what Japan needs than any other nation, and in the
exchanges her products need not all be absorbed by us, as the trade
will make us the factor between Japan and Europe for the distribu
tion of her surplus.. Her production of silk and tea, two world sta
ples, is increasing, and will naturally seek an outlet to the world
through the United States. These considerations will make our
people far from indifferent as to the outcome of the present war.
T T 7HILE its volume does not attract attention, the increase of
Wy our trade with Japan is significant- That increase of course
* V will show great gains when the returns for the last fiscal year
arc made, for our exports have been enormously increased by the
war. It is probable that nearly $20,000,000 of Japanese trade has
been centered in San Francisco in the last year, or has been car
ried through here and exported on our Pacific liners. With her
natural expansion permitted, the foreign trade oi that empire will
be greatly enhanced-- Especially in foodstuffs we may expect a
large share of the increase.
The farm land of Japan is divided into very small holdings, and
every square inch is made to produce its utmost. , But the population
increases faster than the. food supply and the islands in that respect,
as in many others, grow, to resemble the condition of the British Isles.
We offer the best source of a supply and that, as in the case of Great
Britain, is a guarantee of amity between the two countries. Japan
has done more in the . encouragement of agriculture than Great
Britain. Only 15 per cent of the land in Japan is arable, or 14,995,272
acres, and 55 per cent of the farms are of only two acres. Every
farmer's family follows some subsidiary industry, such as rearing silk
worms and reeling and'spinning silk.
The Government aids agriculture by irrigation laws, the pro
tection of forests to conserve moisture, the formation' of farmers*
guilds or clubs, and improved drainage.-" A'Govemment -experimental
farm with nine branches is maintained, where inspection of seeds,
agricultural chemistry, entomology, vegetable physiology and path
ology and horticulture are taught. This work has increased the
products of the soil by minimizing the ravages of insects and plant
diseases, and by the introduction of new plants. One of the most use
ful aids furnished by the Government is the hypothek banks, which
loan capital to the fanners on low interest and enable them 'to im
prove their condition by cheap use of their credit. Livestock, espe
cially ruminating animals, is not an important industry, because of
the lack of native forage plants suited to them, and the land , is too
valuable to be seeded in exotic forage plants. '*'.'.
But with all these drawbacks on agriculture Japan has increased
her foreign trade, and when the exchanges get sufficient to mate
rially augment her food supply more of her .population will be re
leased from farming to engage in the industries which supply the
foreign demand. In 1902 we exported to Japan $24,000,000 of pro
ducts, against $25,000,000 from Great Britain and $2O,ooojpoo from
China. That is not particularly encouraging. But when we turn
to the increase in our trade the statistics take on a' more cheerful asr
pect, In 1890 Japan took of us only $3,000,000, and oÂ£ Great Britain
$13,000,000. In 1902 she took of us $24,000,000, and of Great Britain
$25,000,000. So our trade increased in twelve years $21,066,000 and
Great Britain's only $12,000,000. - . -
A French political economist writing on the subject says it may
as well be admitted that the United States, by reason of its geo
graphical position, will soon exceed all other nations asT an exporter
to Japan. Y '.'â¢Â¦.' â¢

bors complained of it. To which Mr.
Dunphy responded by stating that
every time there was disorder In his
domicile it was provoked by Mrs. Dun
phy arriving with "bun on." To ex
press his disapproval of her condition
he broke furniture.
"Don't do that any more," said Judge
Mogan to Mr. Dunphy. "If you object
to Mrs. Dunphy equipping herself with
a 'bun' once a fortnightrand if she ig
nores your objection, the best thing you
can do Is to apply, for. a divorce. Fur
niture-smashing is a costly and ; Inef
fectual way of expressing your dis
pleasure. Go home now." â¢ .;
Frank Beery pleaded that he was un
der the Influence of opium fumes when
he stole a buggy robe from a vehicle
on Post Btreet. near Kearny, last
Wednesday afternoon.
"Ef I hadn't bin full uv de hop," he
inquired. , "do youse t'ink I'd a taken
any euch chance as dat?"
Judge Cabaniss profes^d inability to
answer the query with any degree of
Intelligence, and then sentenced Mr.
Beery to three months' imprisonment.
"Twenty-four hours apiece." was
Judge Mogan's rude interruption of Mr.
Brown's nocturne. >-T
Up epake William Brown in behalf of
himself and four other gentlemen who
had been arrested for sleeping amid the
hay bales on the Harrison-street wharf.
"We are not vagrants," said William;
"but tourists en route from Vancouver,
B. C, to Phoenix. Ariz., for change of
climate. The night was warm and our
lodging-houseâ I forget what lodging
house it was â became so stuffy that we
sallied for to inhale fresh air. Fate
directed our footsteps to the place
where this policeman found us. We sat
down there to rest. Above was a firm
ament thickly bespangled with bril
liants. From the placid bay wafted a
breeze, gentle as a babe's breathing.
The soughing of tiny wavelets amid the
wharf supports came faintly . to our
ears. We slept. The combined influ
ence of "
* Judge Cabaniss and the attaches of
his tribunal handled gingerly and in
spected with respectful awe the wea
pon which John W\ Hughes, a bridge
builder from Truckee, had concealed
on his Derson when he was arrested
for fighting with the bartender of a
Third-street saloon. It was a single
barrel, muzzle-loading pistol, very
Ehort of barrel and bo very wide of
bore that it resembled a diminutive
old-fashioned mortar. Clerk Barney
Conlan oronounced it a "Colt derrin
ger," and inspection proved it, of the
vintage of IS 52. Mr. Hughes said
that he carried the venerable firearm
in remembrance of one of his uncles
who was a famous duelist when Cali
fornia was young and less law-abiding
than it has since become. His Honor
continued the case till to-day in order
to have 'the pistol inspected by a com
mittee of antiauarlans to be selected
by himself.
"I would consign them to reforma
tory institutions in charge of scien
tists," was the answer. "Prisons
should be maintained for the reforma
tion instead of the punishment of
criminals."
"Tours is not a new theory, Mr.
Clark," quoth the Court, "but in
practice It has been found wanting.
Statistics show that about seventy per
cent of the convicts who professed
desire to reform and were* aided to
do so finally returned to crime. Our
existing system of treating crime may
not be perfect, but half a dozen years'
experience as a police magistrate has
convinced mrthat it is as good a one
as can be operated under existing so
cial and political conditions. Your
suggestion that criminals should be
scientifically coddled and nursed as
invalids, is illogical. Fear of punish
ment is certainly a greater deterrent
of crime than fear of being treated as
a ho'spital patient. Transforming our
penitentiaries into sanitariums would
soon have society . burdened with a
score of criminals for every one that
now afflicts it. The prispn cruelties
you have alluded to, Mr. Clark, may
be exaggerated, or they may be neces^
sary In the maintenance of prison dis
cipline. Penologists know that men in
prison are pretty much like men out
of prison in the matter of difference
of temperament. Individualism asserts
itself whether it is garbed in stripes
or clothed in broadcloth. Refractory
prisoners must be treated more harsh
ly than prisoners who obey the rules.
It is well for society, Mr. Clark, that
your humanitarian ideas are not more
prevalent, else I'm afraid crime would
be even more rampant than if Is.
"To some extent I am a sharer of
the Lombroso theory that crime Â»
a hereditary disease, but so long as
civilization is not prepared to adopt
the Lombroso remedy it Is our duty
as citizens to make the most of the
established system for the prevention
and punishment of crime. You are
excused from serving on this jury."
Soon afterward twelve good, men
and true oronounced Oscar Schaefer
not guilty as charged.
Jay C. Clark, carpenter, 824 Howard
street disqualified himself for Jury
service yesterday in Police Judge Mo
gan's court by declaring that he would
not vote to eend a person to prison
for any crime other than murder. So
he was excused from serving in- the
case of Oscar Schaefer, accused of a
grave offense.
"I believe," said Mr. Clark, "that
our penal system is radically : wrong.
Gross cruelties are practiced 'in' the
state prisons, and I would not send
any offender there unless he commit
ted murder."
"What would you do with the
authors of minor crimes?" the Judge
inquired.

Transformed Into Sanitariums and Finds

mature children. After that I took

nervous woman to a strong, happy and
healthy wife within seven months. With-
in two years a lovely little girl was born,
who is the pride and joy of my household.
If every woman who is cured feels as
grateful and happy as I do, you must

"Dea* Mrs. Putkham: â I suffered with stomach complaint for
years. I got so bad that I could not carry my children but five months,
then would have a miscarriage. The last time I became pregnant, my
husband got me to take Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
After taking the first bottle I was relieved of the sickness of stomach,
and began to feel better in every way. I continued its use and was
enabled to carry my baby to maturity. I now have a nice baby girl,
and can work better than I ever could before. I am like a new wo-
man." â ilBa. Fbaxk Beyer, 22 S. Second St., Meriden, Conn.

â¢ Mme. Fannie Francisca gave the
first of the two extra concerts an
nounced by her management last night
at the Alhambra Theater and her for
mer success was emphasized. by a still
larger audience.
Her opening number was the aria
from "Rossignol," for which the
singer received the heartiest plaud
its. Then the gifted vocalist gave
"Louise," heard for the first time here.
Her rendition of the bell song from
"Lakme" and numbers from "Le Cid"
and "Hamlet" won the highest
encomiums.
Eugene Marcelllno, who made his
debut as a pianist in America, 1 in
stantly found favor with the audience,
and, with Louis Newbauer, the flutist,
helped to make the concert an all
round success. '
The ; Francisca farewell concert will
take place to-morrow (Saturday) after
noon, at -the Alhambra Theater, for
which occasion a splendid programme
has been arranged.

At the regular weekly meeting of
the Building Trades Council last night
delegates from the Painters', Decorat
ors' and Paperhangers' Union No. 1Â»
were present In an anteroom ready to
take their seats as delegates. After,
waiting for some time after tEGy; had
notified the council of the object of
their visit they were informed that
the law and policy of the Building
Trades Council prohibited dual rep
resentation. And. further, that inas
much as the union was already rep
resented there was no further neces
sity for the seating of the delegates.
Wnat the next step will be by
Union No. 19 remains to be seen, as
the action of the BuildlioT Trades
Council in refusing the delegates ad
mission may be looked upon as an in
fringement of Judge Hunt'5 recent de
cision. " A telegl?\m frofn. Toronto,
Canada, was received from Delegate
Eupene Clancy of the Housesmiths*
and' Architectural Iron Workers'
Union stating that San FrUnclsco was
honored by his election- to the office
of Jrtcond vice president.
A visiting delegation from tha
Butchers' Unlott,' consisting of "Wil
liam McCue, Emll Pequillan, E. Preid
man and James Rown. was accorded
the floor and on their representation
the council indorsed the boycott on
six wholesale butchers' establishments
heretofore mentioned.
The council appointed the follow
ing as a conference committee on the
Saturday half holiday for workmen:
O. A. Tveitmoe/ Thomas F. Parken
son and A. S. Nolan. This committee
will meet with a like committee from

'The testimony of Lydla H. Morrow
was substantially the same as * Mrs.
Kibbe's. The depositions of other mem
bers of the association will be taken
later.
Mrs. Mate C. Caxtwright was asked If she
had written ' the lettar and she refused to
answer. Mrs. Foster acknowledged that ahe
had caused the telegram to be sent.
An Investigating committee, composed of
Mrs. Falrbrother, Laura Plnney and Minora
E. Kibbe, was appointed to probe Into the
affair. Mrs. Foster and Mrs. Cartwright were
asked to appear before the investigating body
and tttaar themselves. They refused to do so.
The Investigation proceeded and a report was
cent to the executive committee, as It was
within their power to mete out punishment.
O_-_ November 9. at a meeting of the execu
tive committee, a motion was made by one
of the members to dismiss the woman from
tho organization. It was carried. A vote was
taken in which twelve of the fourteen votes
were l^r the dismissal of tho accused woman.
Some tim* after that Mrs. E. M. North
made S, plea before the club for a new trial,
saying that all the members of thÂ» club
should vote on the question of dismissing the
woman. Mrs. North was Informed that the
casa bad been decided according to the by
laws of the association and the case would
not be reopened, as they did not care to have
the affair become public.
The fight of Mrs. Marion B. Foster
agairist the Women's Press Association
is on fn earnest. Depositions of Minora
E. Kibbe and Lydla H. Morrow were
taken yesterday morning in the law
offices of Hess & Harris. The women
and many other members of the Pacific
Coast Women's Press Association are
defendants in a suit for damazes.
brought against them by Marion B.
Foster, a former member of the asso
ciation, who charges the defendants
with conspiracy in having dismissed
her from the association without sriv
lng her a fair trial, thereby injuring her
reputation. Minora E. Kibbe said:
In 1903 Mrs. Foster went to the International
League of Press Clubs' Convention in Atlantlo
City. She was an alternate delegate. Mrs.
Abble Kreba went as a regular delegate.
During the session Mrs. Foster was elected
a 'member of the executive committee. When
tho delegates returned home It was learned
that a letter had been sent to Atlantlo City
bearing the official seal of the local associa
tion, suggesting the name of Mrs. Foster as
the woman to be elected on the executive com
mittee, as she was the one whom the asso
ciation wanted elected. Later a telegram was
sent congratulating ths organization on its se
lection. >
Dramatic and sensational was the In
cident Â¦which interrupted the proceed
ings in Judge Coffey's court yesterday
morning when Frederick P. Anthes
called down curses upon the head of
the sister of his dead wife, who is ths
custodian of his only daughter.
Half rising from the witness chair,
his face dark with anger and shaking
a clenched flst at Jessie L. Rothennel,
he shouted: "I pray to God. that the
eouls of my dead boy and his mother
will curse your lying carcass until the
day of your death."
"That's enough," Interposed Judgo
Coffey. "I have a notion to fine you."
"All right. I'll pay the fine," Baid
Anthes, "but I am only human. I could
not help it"
"It ends this case." said thÂ» court.
"Any man who would give expression
to such sentiments or use such lan
guage as you have used is not a proper
person to have the custody of a child."
Frederick Anthes is a coffee and spice
â¢dealer and a professional musician.
TVhen his wife died tys son, Phillip,
and daughter, Jessie, were given into
the custody of their aunt. Miss Rother
mel. Anthes married again. The son
died and the father wanted the girl to
come to live with him and filed a peti
tion In court to accomplish that end.
Miss Rothennel resisted and the child,
now 16 years old, expressed a desire to
stay with the aunt, saying that she no
longer visited her father because he
Ignored her. Anthes was beingr exam
ined and stated that under a great an
guish and humiliation he had told the
daughter that ho never wanted to see
her again.
â¢ "It was all on account of that
'woman," ho said; referring to Miss
Rothennel. '"My boy was dead for a
day at Her. house and I was not even
told that he had been sick and I knew
nothing of his case until I was sent for
to take his dead body. away. At the*
funeral my- daughter would not ride in
my carriage."
Miss Rothermel has been paid $25 a
month for t'Ae care of the girl. She
said that the child was happy and is
attending the Lick School. She de
clared that Anthes is a man of violent
temper and has abused his daughter
with harsh wjjrds. Judge Coffey de
cided not to disturb the custody of the
girl for the present, but expressed a
desire to talk to the child privately to
find if there Is a chance for more
friendly relations with her father.

NEW YORK, Sept 23.â The stock market

rea'.iri&g and prices are lower as a conse
quence, but it must ctill be said that the r-
Â«.:.z : c was well taken and the fall ln prices
was by no nifacis precipitate. The movement
was not accounted for by any news develop
ments either to induce Felling or to cause ad
vances in the Tew evocks that showed strength.
The etrong f tocks> were believed to be supported
to help the rÂ»-Â£.l!s!ng ln the general market.
The operatic ns wert alleged to be almost whol
ly in the hands of prefeFtionals or of that
r'.&ss of wealthy speculators who make oc
casions! campaigns in f^curities with the use
cf professional method*. The coalers furnished
i/w princlps.1 support for the market, although
the August eerr.ir.g* of the anthracite carriers
proved very unfavorable, compared with the
ehowtag cf some other railroads. This was a
fair examylp of the disregard of news which
cc&racterl2ed the movement. In spite cf ma
terial retrenchment in the expense account
for both the railroad and coal companies.

gin. Yesterday till? stock was the exception to
show weakness in the group. It wu hurt by
further consideration of the plan-by which the
dividend is made conditional on a 912,000,000
bond Issue. Heading, on the other hanfl, was
the mainetay cf the market, and was bid up
strain and acain, with rallying on the declines
caused by the pruflt-taking. The high priced
coalers were conspicuous. Leckawanca selling
vp to SOO on bidding for 100-chare lots. Stocks
which have been the leaders of the recent ad
vence were freely sold to-day. This
was especially true of United Etates Bteel
preferred. The advance ln this etock has aroused
skepticism owing to the lack cf news to ac
count tor it. end when It was perceived that
recent buyers were realising to-day, the pres
sure to sell bore hesvily upon it. The sharp
reaction in Northern Securities on the curb was
the Eicnal for a decline in Union Pacific and
'attracted suspicion of a manipulative source
ior the Buir.t-roiis rumors ln circulation of
late cf a cotr.rroir.iae In the Northern Secu
rities case. The grangers and Pacifies sym
pathized with the heaviness of Union Pacific,
and even Ft. Paul, which was lifted a point,
lost it again. Weakness in some of the Van

Late mall adrioes from New York say:
"A rather better tone to thÂ« prune mar
ket was noted, which was due to an Im
proved deniand coming principally from coun
try buyers. Sales were not large, but were
reported to be more numerous than for some
V.rr.e past, as Jobbers are beginning to feel
the consuming <ltmarjd. and not having bought
vrry freely heretofore are now poorly supplied.

luni of %g%c. according to seller. Trade In
fesjrhes ie rpstricted by the strong views of
tellers and the email offerings. Apricots are
â¢ rar:ng'.y offered and firmly held, but there
iÂ«.â¢ to l>e little demand at the moment.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
The Chicago wires of E. F. Hutton & Co.
said:
"It was a nervous market with some scat
tered liquidation, but not on a large scale.
The tone was, however, heavy, and although
it closed at pome slight reaction from the
low point it seemed to indicate nothing, but
scalping operations. Primary receipts were
again large, i The cash market showed much
less urgent demand, and this is the key note
to the situation. The speculative buying is
not on a large scale and not of a very good
character. WÂ« still look for a good scalping
market, and are inclined to think the drift
will be toward lower prices."
In the local market futures were l%e up
on a bullish "feeling and covering by shorts.
with a lively business. Cash grain was firm,
with salea at top prices.

demand became general. The market readily j
responded to the Improved buying, December
advancing to $1 13* May sold up to $1 13%.
Beavy realizing sales soon caused renewed
weakness. Primary receipts were 10 per cent
in excess of those of a year ago, and this
fact had considerable influence on the late
selling. The low point on December was
reached at $1 11%. May sold oft to 91 11%.
The market rallied slightly. . but I the close
was weak, with December at 91 U9i@l 11%.
May closed at 91 12%.
Favorable weather and a decline in wheat
prices caused weakness* in corn. There was
a fair volume of business, with pit traders
favoring the selling side. December closed
50T 8 c. a loss of %c.
Oats were affected by weakness of other
grains. Trading was quiet. December closed
at 30%c, a decline of %c. .
Provisions were weak early as a result of
lower prices for -hogs. A good demand for
lard caused a steadier feeling later in the
day. There was considerable | liquidation of
pork and at the close the January option was
off 7%c; lard and ribs were unchanged.

Chile, special, commissioner of the De

to Fresno yesterday to look 'into the
California methods of curing figs and
raisins. He took with him letters
from Manager Arthur R. Briggs of the
California State Board of Trade, who
requested that every possible facility
for investigation/ should be afforded.
The Fresno CKSmber of Commerce has
a. large fund of information and. in
Fresno County the fig and raisin indus
tries are very large. Raisins are pro
duced in Chile. The purpose of the
inquiry in this State is to ascertain
whether California methods can be
employed sucessf ully r in Chile. ' The
present methods of curing raisins in
South America are crude and not suit
ed to the requirements of the general
trade.- Land in Chile that is adapted
to fruit growing is:much higher priced
than are the 'fruit lands of California.

Rogers' story, as told by Judge Dorn,
is that he is a miner and owns a val
uable claim near the Morgan or Fair
mine, the latter being in litigation and
disuse. Rogers broke a lot of rich ore
from the outcroup on his claim and
brought it to the Selby smelter, which
paid him $2582 50 for it, he reserving
some fine samples. He was walking up
the street with his young brother-in
law, named Majors, when Detectives
Gibson and Bell collared him and took
him to the tanks at the Hall of Justice.
There was no charge placed against
him, but he was "sweated" for five
days. He says that ' the detectives
wanted him to,- confess that he stole
the ore from the Morgan mine.
When Attorney Treadwell was about
to have him released on a writ of ha
beas corpus, Rogers says, he confessed
to. the theft as desired, and said he
had taken about $30,000 wdrth of ore in
the past. He understood, he says, that
after, the alleged confession had served
its purpose he was % to have the prop
erty back, but one of the Magees took
it and kept lt.c Rogers declares that
he was under duress, and that his con
fession was false. He maintains that
the ore came from his own property
and proposes to prove it to the satis
faction of "the court.
The experience of William Rogers,
prospector and miner, with detectives
and agents of millionaires makes. a re
markable story, 'which is to have an
airing in the Superior Court.' Yester
day, by his attorneys, Dorn, Dorn &
Savage, he brought suit to recover
$2582 50 in coin and. $1000 worth of gold
ore specimens from Theresa A. Oel

Mrs. Lillian Fleming of 1006 Buchan
an street, Mrs. Rose Wagner of S649
Twenty-second street, this city, and
Mrs. Florence Cain of 944 Wood street,
Oakland, called at the Coroner's of
fice yesterday afternoon and told a re
markable story to the effect that their
deceased father, John Kenny, 58 years
old, had been leading a double life.
He died suddenly last Tuesday at
1426 Market street of heart failure.
When Deputy Coroner Brown arrived
to take the body to the Morgue he was
introduced to a woman who gave the
name of Ann Kenny and said the dead
man had been her husband. She said
ba was a member of Pacific Lodge of
Masons of this city and that the Ma
sons would inter the body. Deputy
Brown thereupon allowed- Undertaker
Halsted to take charge of the remains.
Kenny's daughters informed Deputy
Coroner Meehan yesterday afternoon
that their father had never been di
vorced from, their mother and that
neither she nor they were aware that
any suit for divorce had ever been
filed. Their father was a commercial
traveler, they said, and left home
about a year ago on business. When
he returned about two weeks ago their
mother was in Mill Valley and it had
â¢been arranged that he and she were
to go to housekeeping In this city to
morrow. - â¢
His daughters called at the Coroner's

To prevent her husband from sacri
ficing the business of the Hotel Inver
ness and to insure a proper amount of
alimony for herself, Annie B. Higgins
yesterday filed an affidavit In â¢ sup
port of a request for the court
to order Theodore S. Higgins to
give security for her expected
alimony and for the appointment of. a
receiver for the hotel business. She
says he has not given her her share of
the $3750 received by him from the ho
tel since August 8, and declares that
he, his brother Rufus and Dr. Wheeler
tried last Sunday to frighten her into
a settlement of her claim for commu
nity property. She says he has . not
paid the September rent, and the pro
prietor will take the hotel, and he will
not pay the next installment on the
furniture, letting it go by default. She
reiterates that Higgins receives $500 a.
month from his dentist practice and
declares that she worked for $25 and
$30 a month in stores in order to help
support him when he was attending
the College of Dentistry. >

man, at Post and Polk streets on the
night of June 25, is drawing to a close
in Judge Lawlor's court. All the evi
dence for the defense was concluded
yesterday afternoon and at 4 o'clock
the jurors left the courtroom to per
sonally examine the locality of the
shooting. The case will go to the jury
to-day.
Will Soon Know His Fate.
"The right to put the curve there is
beyond any question," said Tirey L..
Ford, attorney for the corporation. "In
fact, it was there for twenty-five years
by virtue an ordinance passed on
November 12, 1879. granting the Central
Railway Company or its successor, the
franchise for fifty years to operate a
street-car line beginning from East
street and . running -along certain
streets, including the curve from Kear
ny into Post. The curve was taken
up in 1899 by . our predecessors
for some reason or other and re
laid by us recently."
President Schmitz of . the Works
Board received the following communi
cation from General Manager Chapman
in response to the former's order to re
move the. curve at Post and Kearny
streets: - ,.;r ; !i
'This will acknowledge receipt of your com
munication of the 27th lnÂ»t., relative to the
track curves recently installed toy the company
I 'Commissioner Casey stated that he
had never seen any application from
the United Railroads to lay the spur
track and a permit must first be ob
tained to tear up the streets.
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
yesterday took up the question* raised
by E. P. E. Troy in a communication
as to whether the United Railroads has
laid any spur tracks illegally, with par
ticular reference to the curve at Post
and Kearny streets, D street and
Sixth and Eighth avenues and at other
points. Other questions propounded by
Troy to the corporation for replies were
ordered to be formally filed with the
board for reference in the regular way
to the committee. .
Finally a car was run out to be
placed on the switch at Kearny street
so as to block the workmen at that
end. The word was given arid the
car was got under way, when suddenly
an innocent vender of fresh fruits
came along with his steed. The car
men cursed, but before, the car was
run over the switch the workmen got
under the wagon and tore up the
switch, while the driver, all innocent
of what a commotion he had caused,
looked wistfully on till ordered on by
a policeman.
Several officials from the United
Railroads were present giving orders,
but they did not bother the workmen.
The railroad officials were very reti
cent regarding their plansand move
ments. About all they did was to hold
councils while the husky laborers were
hammering away at the rails so that
the job might be completed as quickly
as possible.
SUPERVISORS TALK IT OVER.
This was in the form of running a
car on the spur up and down to pre
vent the workmen from proceeding
with their task. But it did not work,
for the agile employes of. the city im
mediately- piled rocks upon the tracks
and the car was finally run up Post
street. . Soon after a similar move was
made, but the same tactics prevailed
again and the .railroad officials with
drew to think over a new plan.
ATTEMPT TO BLOCK TRACKS.
The much disputed spur track of ths
United Railroads which turns into Post
street from Kearny was torn up by
a gang of men from the Board of Pub
lic Works . shortly after 5 o'clock last
night. The # United Railroads mad*
but a slight* resistance and when the
city's laborers began their task the/
experienced but little difficulty in com
pleting it. While the work of tear
ing up the rails was going on a large
crowd collected and mild excitement
prevailed for a while.
It was an Italian fruit peddler who
saved the day for the city. This pur
veyor of delicacies "butted in" with
his wagon just as a car was about to
be run on the switch so as to prevent
the workmen from tearing it out. While
the humble fruit monger's wagon was
innocently standing in front of the car
the workmen got busy and tore the
switch out without opposition.
It took the men about two hours to
complete their Job. They . commenced
work shortly after 3 o'clock and by 5
o'clock the outer rail was torn out and
traffic. on that branch of the road was
completely tied up. The workmen were
in charge of Foremen A. J. .Donovan,
J. E. Brandon and Edward Nolan. ...
The story had been passed out that
the United Railroads would make forc
ible objections when the city's work
men came upon the scene ready to tear
up the rails. But it was not so. For
an hour they worked in peace and had
the rails all but ready to tear out when
the railroad people made their first
hostile move.
