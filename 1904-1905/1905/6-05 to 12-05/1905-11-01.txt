Kmpire, and in IShO Chief Procurator of
ii)Â«> Holy Synod. Th!sÂ« j>ost' is- practi
cally: the connecting: link between the
Hussian orthodox church and the Czar.
In the years of the. reign of Alex
ander II there was a strong movement
to replace many of the old and barbarous
institutions in Russia by the more en
lightened ideas of .Western Europe, but
Pf.biedonosteeff strongly opposed all in
novations, maintaining that none of them
would be applicable to Russia and Rus
fclan ideas. He always set his face stead
ily against parliamentary methods of ad
ministration, modern judicial organiza
tion, trial by jury, frewlom.to the press
and secular education.
Probably there was no man in Russia
raorf cordially detested by so many peo
tSf as Pobi^donoFtscff. He f always op
posed by every means in his power, any
liberalization of the civil or religious in
stitutions of Rusfia, but he was at lea^st
sincere. . He believed Implicitly that Rus
sia was destined to dominate the globe,
and frequently said: \u25a0 .
"Russia is not a state; Russia Is a
world."
For a quarter of a century Pobiedonost
Â«eff-dominated the Council of the Empire
toy his overwhelming personality. None
Â©f- the Ministers could, withstand the
crushing force of his arguments and his
victories were countless. , ...
The reform movement had no more
Miter opponent than he. He fou&ht
-igaiust it with all his strength and
when he found that the tide of opinion
was too strong for him he persuaded
the Czar to issue a reactionary mani
festo as an offset to the reform re
script.
He resisted the scheme of Metro
politan Antonius for a church council
and the restoration of the patriarchate,
and finally not only succeeded in de
feating the attempt, but also. caused its
originator to be practically banished
to' the Caucasus, while at the same time
Count' de Witte earned his undying
enmity for supporting the movement,
P^biedonostseff practically received
his political oeath blow when the im
perial ukase was striking, the
shackles from religion. What' made It
all the more bitter ,. was . the fact that
it synchronized with the anniversary of
his jubilee as Procurator General of the
Holy Synod. ; . : #Wvlf*

Populace Celebrates Its DeLlV
erance From Tyranny.
Authorities Make No, Effort to
Check Demonstration.
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 31.â The Rus
sian capital blossomed out with flags and <
bunting ; t6-day. All troops were with
drawn from the streets and the city pre
sented almost its normal appearance. The
nervousness* of the people, had suddenly
disappeared. Workmen by the thousands
flocked back to the shops and factories
without awaiting the permission of the
strike committee. The authorities did all j
in their power to encourage/the spirit ot j
rejoicing over the newly .granted* liberties, j
It was by order of General Trepoff that |
the regulation decorations were hung but, |
and the troops were instructed to permit j
the people to vent their feellrigs." ' |
Before noon the celebrations were be
gun, and the city soon appeared to have
gone mad. Such scenes had never before
been witnessed in Russia. .Unrestrained j
by word or deed, the crowds" did and said
what they liked.- Despotism seemed sud
denly to have been . replaced by license.
Red flags were , everywhere in evidence.
In the churches devout men and women
on bended knees before the Image of St.
Nicholas, the "miracle, worker, rendered
thanks for the blessings of liberty, while
at the corners of the thronged streets
orators harangued, the populace. -The
people assembled - principally on the-Nev
sky prospect. From. the Kazan Cathedral
to the town hall, opposite tne Hotel de ]
l'Europe, traffic was blocked. F"ully , 50,000
workmen were massed there listening to
student orators, .who delivered impas
sioned speeches from thei steps of the
town hall and cathedral. Red. flags
showed above the dense black mass of
cheering humanity. The police kept In the
background. rioY even trying to- keep the
street open Passing patrols on their way
to the barracks would have been mobbed
nad it not been for the appeals of the
cool-headed, who declared, to the accom
paniment' of cheers, that the : troops â¢ were
henceforth with the people. ;
STUDENTS ;CARIIV RED ' BANNERS.
The. biggest demonstration was organ- j
ized by students and workmen. A "great
procession was' formed. ' Starting from the
university 10.UOO strong, it Increased in
numbers as the demonstrators marched ;
across the river and up the Nevsky pros
pect as far as the Kazan Cathedral sing- ,
Ing the â¢â¢Marseillaise." A dozen red ban
ners inscribed with the word "Svoboda"
(Liberty) were carried at. the head of the
parade, which stopped' at the places
where thej troops fired, on the people on
January 22. and .the paraders; with bared
heads, chanted funeral dirges. The
crowds in . the streets ; uncovered their
heads as the procession passed:
At the Kazan Cathedral the procession
countermarched to. the university, where
from, the balconies students harangued
the crowds with fiery speeches, urging
the people not to cease the struggle until j
every right of nfan had 1 been attained. In ,
the midst of the oratory 'immense enthu- ;
siasm was ' created ,by a student who j
scaled-the roof ."-of â¢ the., university and. at
tached a red flag to the cross over the
entrance. i .T >'
The following is a sample of the inflam-.
matory speeches:
\u25a0 You must go to the prisons and liberate your,
comrades. Go armed with revolvers, dynamite '
and bombs." Trepoft is still in cower. Our
watchword must 'be that all. the troops must
be withdrawn from St. Petersburg and leave
the c&Mtal In our possession. That bloody ;
scoundrel TY*DOft must be driven out of Rue-,
aia Tbe donra of the baetile --and of the for
tresses must be opened and a. national Kuard :
must be created for the protection of; our lib-i
ertle.Â«. â¢ It. 'would be fatal . to - stop now. . The ;
Emperor has yielded because he Is not sure of
the army, which, brothers. Is with us. The r ;
swords are on our side. Hurrah for liberty! \u25a0
Hurrah for Bociallsm! . - !
LOYALISTS PH\Y FOR THE CZAR.
Counter demonstrations took place on
the palace square, where thousands of
people bearing white flags knelt on' the
cobblestones and sang "God Save the Em
peror" and prayed for the Emperor.
Although admitting that there is some
danger in the uncontrolled exuberance of
the people, the authorities have decided

BERLJN, Oct. 31.â Emperor. William wrote
to Emperor Nicholas last wlntef suggesting
that he, grant .Russia a..constltution.that should
Include the right of habeas corpus, upon which
the' German Emperor; seemingly"; laid stress. In
succeeding letters .Emperor. William:- followed
up: the subject," always .taking the vlÂ«w that
Emperor- Nicholas would find the labor of rul
ing'; Russia' simplified" by sharing the respon
sibilities with.. elected representatives. ..' The
Kusaian Emperor's manifesto is received here,
therefore with uncommon satisfaction in Gov
ernment circles, %v here it is believed Russia
. now enter up*, a a period of constitutional
'development. ' '
Conservative â¢ and moderate opinions, as ex
pressed In the newspapers, consider: that the
concession was ; wrung from Emperor Nicholas
and that his decree was an announcement pf
the bankruptcy of the autocracy. ,
I No evening socialist paper Is published, but

ENSNARES HIS AGENT
A piece of trickery on the part of cunning -George D. Collins, aided by Attorney H. A.-Krouse,
was nipped in the bud in Judge Graham's court yesterday. By deception Krouse had induced .Mrs";
Charlotta Collins, wife No. I, to sign a substitution of himself in place of Hiram Johnson as her at
torney so that he might nullify efforts at prosecution. Johnson exposed the plot.
H. A. Krouse Is Charged
With Tricking
Woman.
Collusion of Lawyer
Is Accusation
in Court.
In his struggles "to escape the conse
quences of his alleged offenses against
the laws of California George D. Collins
has dragged Attorney H. A. Krouse into
the unsavory mess that surrounds him.
Krouse was unmasked in Judge Graham's
department of the Superior Court yes
terday when he appeared to complete the
record of his substitution as an attorney
for Mrs. Charlotta Eugenic Collins, suc
ceeding: Hiram K. Johnson, whose shrewd
ness is responsible for the presence of
Collins in this city.
The record, however, was not com
pleted and Krouse is not yet attorney for
Mrs. Collins. When he appeared yester-
day he was confronted by Attorney John
son. Suspicious that all was not well
vith his plans, Krouse approached John
son and said:
"Mr. Johnson. I would like to have you
sign at this time the order substituting
xre in your place as attorney for Mre.
Ccllins. You promised that you would co
sign it-** .-\u25a0...â¢ r.5.-.Â«;. ' /
"I promised you," responded Johnson,
"that I would sign it if all vas well and
regular. That is the promise I made.
Now go ahead and make your motion to
tte court that the substitution be com
pleted."
Krouse refused. He bÂ«?gan to see that
he was discovered and that his plan, as
a. friend of George D. Collins, to get
Johnson out of the case and then, as aJ
leced, run things in Collins' interest,
â¢would be defeated. "Very well." said
Jchnson. "take the etand."
"What for?" saia Krouse.
"You will see," said Johnson, and he
KItOUSK OX THE STAXD.
Krouse took the witness chair as direct
ed, whereupon Johnson, addressing the
cewt, said:
"I charge now that this man. represent
ing George D. Collins, called on Charlotta
Collins last Friday night and that he rep
resented to her at that time certain things
that he could do and that he would do,
acd that he obtained from her upon those
representations, which were false, a state
ment or an agreement on her part that
subsequently she would substitute him as
thf attorney of record In this case. Pur
suing this particular plan, this man, rep
resenting George D. Collins. Is now
trifling with the process of this court, col
lufively endeavoring on behalf of George
D. Collins to take this case to some
other court in some other proceeding, and
is :jow acting, although an attorney at
late of this city -and an officer of this
court. collusiveJy in this proceeding, and
not on behalf of Charlotta E. Collins, and
now, charging that, 1 ask your Honor the
right to ask this man particular ques
tions."
"It is easy enough for Mr. Johnson to
charge me with representing George D.
Collins." Interjected Krouse, "but he
war.ts the court to assume this to be a
fact, which fact is not in evidence and
certainly cannot be,"
- Asked as to whether or not he had not
told Mrs. Collins that he could secure
for her If she substituted him as her at
torr.ey all of the back alimony due her.
K re i use said:
MKYinS ACTS ARE FRAUDULENT.
"I don't think I did. I might have told
her that he told me that he. would pay
her no alimony as long as a personal and
open and avowed enemy of his, with
whom be could not talk over the case in
a friendly cplrit, represented, her i as at
torney. He told me that, and told me I
could tell her that, and that if she want
ed to have an attorney with whom he
couid get together and discuss the case
he might do something of that kind
voluntarily. I didn't tell her anything
aier.p those lines that was not so. I told
her nothing that was false or fraudulent
or untrue."
"Are you an intimate friend of Col
lins?" asked Johnson.
"Ye*, sir." answered Krouse. "I am
his friend just as I am your friend, or
the friend of any attorney with whom I
am associated . at the bar."
"W?JI you deny that you and Mr. Col-

lins consulted and agreed upon the pro
cedure you wou!d take in this case?"
"I told Mrs. Collins as to the procedure
I would take and that I thought that If
Mr. Collinsâ with some one that he knew
was frlendly-r^ould be consulted with
he would do what was right. I to!d
Mrs. Collins that I was friendly with Mr.
Collins and that it was at his suggestion
that I came to see her.' I told her that, if
I brought such proceeding, and that if
he did not then voluntarily do what we
believed to be fair and proper, he ceuld
be made to do sol"
"Didn't you and Collins, before you took
the proceedings yesterday, converse re
garding that proceeding, and was it not
spoken of between you and Collins, or
you and Collins' attorney, that It 'would
enable Collins to go to the Supreme
Court?"
Krouse's answer, a fair sample of them
all, demonstrated the confusion that "held
him, and it Is given in full as a sample
of his mental processes.
RECOLLECTION FAILS HIM.
"I have no recollection of that. I think
that I said something to him about if he
didn'tâ l think \u25a0 I said something to
him about getting a citation, and
be may have said: "Well, possi
bly that would be the better way
for all concerned,' and that he would
probably voluntarily do what' was right,
and at the same time it would probably
be better for all concerned to know
whether or not this court really had Juris
diction In the matter anyhow. It seems
to me that Collins said something 'about
the procedure. . The object and purpose,
as I understand itâ at least the .main
purpose as I understand itâ was to have
some means to compel him to do what he
ought to do If he didn't do it volun
tarily.' "
After the testimony was closed Judge
Graham said: "I think that In view of
what has been disclosed on this hearing,
notwithstanding the fact that Mrs. Col
lins has the right to change her attorney
at any time, and in view of the accusa
tion made by Mr. Johnson against Mr.
Krouse I shall appoint Mr. Johnson to j
act as amicus curiae and direct him to
subpoena Mrs. Collins and her children" to
be here next Frfday, at which - time Mr.
Collins has beÂ«n directed to show cause
why he should not be punished for con
tempt of court for disobeying the order
pt this court directing him . to pay Mrs.
Collins $100 a month for her mainten
ance." ....
Judge Graham then addressed Attorney
Louis P. Boardman, who appeared as the
representative of Collins to argue his mo
tion for a dismissal of the order to show
cause, at whlchaction Krouse sought to
succeed Johnson, asking Boardman If he
was aware of the fact, as charged, \ that
collusion existed between Collins .'. and
Krouse to secure the subtltution. Board
man said that he knew nothing, of the
matter: that he had just been informed
of the fact that Krouse was seeking to
bÂ« substituted in place of Johnson. Judge
Graham then ordered the case continued
until Friday morning at 10 o'clock, at
v which time Krouse will be! given another
opportunity to more fully explain his po
sition.
MAKES AN AFFIDAVIT.
At that time an affidavit, sworn to by
Mrs. Collins and sotting forth in detail
the peculiar manner in which Krouse ap
proached her and secured her consent to
be substituted In . place of Johnson, will
be read. This affidavit follows:" :;^: ;^ .â¢ ."'

that would have bound 'the court, to act

a Few Miles From Fresno
NO CLEW TO
Crime Believed to Have Fol
"\ lowed Frustrated Attempt
to Rob Pioneer nd Wife
FRESNO, Oct. 31.â Three miles east of
Jameson this afternon the mutilated bod
ies of W. J. Hayes, a pioneer Justice of
the Peace of this county, and his wife
were found by the roadside. Word of the
discovery of the bodies* was taken to
Jameson by a rancher . and immediately
officers " weYit from here ;to the place,
which is twenty miles distant.
Hayes was evidently getting supper in
his camp, which -was ; made beside the
road last night, when the trouble occurred
that ended in his death and I the death of
his \u25a0 wife. Hayes was shot : through | the
back at close range by a shotgun, and a
terrible blow over: the head 'with a three
cornered instrument ( exposed I his brain.
His body was stretched face . downward
across a shotgun,' which had - not been
discharged. A few v feet I away the wife
was found dead from a blow on the head
similar to â¢ the one . inflicted ' upon Hayes. ,'
There was a shotgun found in the brush
a short distance from the camp. The old
man's pockets; had i been turned wrong
side out. A frying pan placed over 'the
improvised stone fireplace showed that
the couple we_re cooking supper when the
murderer begkn his bloody work.
The officers j claim to have no clew to
work on. They "believe that some one
came to the \u25a0campVwlth the intention of
robbiqg Hayes, that Hayes resisted and
the killing followed.
Hayes left his ranch in the Panochie
country yesterday morning and during
the day bought hay at Whites Bridge. He
and his wife were^ on .their .way- here.
Hayes was Justice of. the Peace at Men
dota from 1594 to 1899.

BOSTON MYSTERY
Connect Doctor and' Woman
With Death of Miss Geary,
the Suit ; Case Victim
ADMISSIONS BY NATHAN
Lover of the Girl Confesses
rto â¢ Facts Which Throw Full
Light Uiwn the Mystery
BOSTON, Oct. 31.â Chief Inspector W.
B: Watts stated to-night that the doc
tor who dismembered the body of Su
sanna A. Geary, the suit case victim,
had been located. He did not expecl.
however, that any arrest would be
made for a day or two, intimating that
the police were waiting for something
more definite from Morris Nathan. '. the
lover of the; girl, who is now in cus
tody in Pittsburgh
The theory "of the police regarding
the whole affair, in which the most se
rious charge can only be manslaughter,
is ; that Miss Geary went to a woman
and submitted to an illegal operation.
The operation was. not a success' but
before the girl died a male physician
was called in and attempted to save the
girl's life by a' second operation for
peritonitis. Miss Geary died and the
doctor then dismembered the body uid
distributed portions of it in two suit
cases, which were subsequently found.
The charge against the woman can only
be one of manslaughter, while according
to Superintendent Pierce â¢of the local
police force It will be 'difficult to bring
any charge against Nathan unless he
should be accused of concealing a crime.
PITTSBURG. Oct. 31.â Morris Nathan,
arrested here in connection with the Win
throp suit case mystery, voluntarily left
the city to-night at 11* o'clock for Boston
In the custody, of Silas P. Smith of the
Massachusetts State Constabulary.
Director Harry Moore of . the Public
Safety Department this afternoon said:
"There is no doubt in my mind that the
so-called Wlnthrop suit case mystery has
been cleared. Morris Nathan, the young
man now In custody, has. admitted this
forenoon that he was responsible for Miss
Geary's' condition and that he endeavored
to get her out of her trouble. While the
demands- of courtesy prohibit me from
giving out Information which rightfuly
belongs to the Boston authorities, I will
say that a man and a woman will be ar
rested shortly and this suit case mystery
will be cleared."
Attorney Henry Slskand accompanied
Nathan to Boston, and while waiting for
his train at the Union station startled the
newspaper men by saying that he ex
pected to produce Miss Geary alive.
"It has not yet been proven." he said,
"that the. parts of the body found. in t~ie
suit case were parts of the body of Susan
Geary. The head has not been found,
and the only means of identification are
cheap rings, of which there are thousands
of identical designs on display in Jewelry
stores all over the country. We will en
deavor to produce Miss Geary alive."

noise and watched -all night, but the
diggers discovered that they were being
watched and quit. To-night Case
feigned going to bed, while tho Sheriff
and half a dozen officers posted them
selves In the jallyard, where they could
easily hear the digging inside.
Soon a hole was made through the wall
from the toy of the tier of steel cells in
side. The men wiggled out. feet first,
dropping below and waiting for . eac.i
other. \u25a0 When the quartet had landed the
Sheriff -\u25a0 fired a shot and the escapes
dropped like dead, as if they had been hit,
offering no resistance.
The plan was for the balance of ths
prisoners to crawl out at different time*

cut away with a piece of scrap steel.
The men who were caught are Frank
Barry. James White. Arthur Chandler
and Charles Bauer, who,. like the ma

MAY YET FORCE
SOUTH TO PAY
Bondholders Plan New Move
Against the States Which
Have Repudiated Securities
TO SEEK FOREIGN AID
To Transfer Part of Their
Holdings to Venezuela and
Colombia for Settlement
NEW. IORK, Oct. 31. â The commit
tee of Xortn Carolina bondholders is
planning a novel move by which it ex
pects to compel North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia and other Southern
btates to redeem repudiated bonds
amounting to about $40,000,000 in the
aggregate.
ender the constitution of the United
States a suit cannot be brought against
oue of the States by a citizen of an
other State or a citizen or subject of
any foreign State. Under the recent de
cision of the Supreme Court of the
United States, in the case of South Da
kota against North Carolina, however,
a Government may recover against a
State of the Union upon its obligations.
' Thflf committee is now planning to
transfer some of the bonds of the de
faulting States not to another State, as
South Dakota, but to a foreign State,
the idea being that public sentiment in
the United States would Induce the
Southern States to pay off the bonds if
suit should be brought by the foreign
States. Venezuela and Colombia, it is
announced, have consented to accept a
gift of some of the repudiated bonds
and to bring action upon them against
the defaulting States.
ALCOHOL SUCCESSFULLY
EXTRACTED FROM BAXAXAS
Result of Experiments Submitted to
the 11110 Board of Trade in
Hawaii.
HONOLULU. Oct. Sl.â Dr. John Holland has
submitted to the Hilo Board of Trade samples
of banana spirits, or alcohol, extracted from
Hilo bananas, together with a report of Ed
ward C Shorey. chemist of the United States
experiment station at Honolulu. The report
shows the perfect feasibility of transforming
bananas Into high-proof alcohol. The sample
.furnished to Dr. Holland was 90 per cent of
alcohol which is the usual strength of com
mercial alcohol. In appearance It is as clear
hb crj'Etai and has a faint aroma of the
banana. It Is shown that a sixty-pound bunch
of banana?, when converted Into alcohol, will
make one gallon of proof spirits.
The bananas used were the Chinese variety.
The waste product, after distillation, forms an
excellent feed for pies.

PRESIDENT BACK
IN WASHINGTON
Returns From the South and
Without Delay Takes Up
the Duties of His Office
HIS SPEECH ON SHIP
Speaks- Words of Praise to
the Officers and 3len on
the Cruiser West Virginia
- WASHINGTON", Oct. 31.â President
Roosevelt reached Washington from
the South this afternoon. He regards
his trip Just ended as a most enjoyable
and profitable experience. Particularly:
did he enjoy the sea voyage, and the
President expressed himself in the
most enthusiastic terms regarding the
ships, officers and men of the squad
ron. â¢ â¢ \u25a0\u25a0.-\u25a0'â¢ '\u25a0'-..'
As the President stepped ashore from
the Dolphin at the navy yard the bugle
sounded and the marine band played
"The Star-Spangled Banner." The
President stood uncovered and the of
ficers and marines stood at "attention."
It was intended that the marines
should escort the President out of â¢ the
yard, but at the conclusion of the trib
ute to the flag Mrs. Roosevelt drove up
from behind the guard, the President
entered the carriage, warmly grasped
the hand of his wife, and his car
riage proceeded out of the yard. The
crowd voiced the sentiment of .wel
come, and as the many huge' shops were
passed the workmen rushed out and
cheered. . ' '\u25a0 â¢
"Glad to see you," shouted the Presi
dent, as he drove on.
"Glad to see you back," came the
voices from the shops.
President Roosevelt devoted several
hours to business during the after
noon. His flrst caller was Secretary
Hitchcock, who was followed by Post
master General Cortelyou and Secre
tary Root.
â¢ Private information was in the pos
session of the President before he left
New Orleans of important changes in
the Russian Government. This change
is viewed with utmost satisfaction
from an American standpoint.
While at 6ea on Sunday the Presi
dent made a speech to the officers and
men of the West Virginia. He had
just completed an inspection of the
entire ship. In the boiler-room a
profusely decorated shovel was put
into his hands and he was .asked to
throw a shovelful of coal into a
particular boiler. He threw In two,
find the boiler was immediately
christened the "Roosevelt boiler." The
shovel was passed around, that^every
stoker might shovel coal with it. It
was then speedily demolished into bits,
each bit being retained as a souvenir.
HIGH PRAISE FOR SAW.
At the conclusion of his speech the
President was given three roUsing
cheers by the officers and men. He
said:
It Is a privilege for any President to come
on board a squadron of American warships
such aa these, not alone to see the ships but
to bee the men who handle them. From the
admiral down through the entire ship s com
oany every American should be proud of what
i have seen aboard this ship; the discipline,
the ready *Ã¼borditjatlon ot each man, whether
officer or enlisted man, to duty, the care taken
of the men and la return the eager, Intelligent,
aelf-respectlns zeal of each man In doing his
work. What must Impress especially any ob
server Is how esbentlal It Is that every In
dividual on a ship like this should hs
whole duty and In any crisis more than.hlÂ»
dU lÂ£e tesult as I see it in this Bhlp^ is a
triumph not only of oreanlzation and dis
cipline, but of the rVady seal with which each
individual performs his alloted task. At any
time some emergency may arise in which
the safety of the entire ahlp will depend upon
the vigilance. Intelligence and cool courage of
some one man among: you. perhaps an oftlcer.
perhaps an enlisted man. Any man In the
whole chip's company who does his full duty
can claim as hU own the honor and repute
of the ship and has a right to feel a personal
pride in al! she does. .â¢
You and your fellows in the navy and in
the sister service, the army, occupy a position
different from that of any other set of men
In our country. Going through the ship yes
terday In the flrlng-room, storerooms, turrets,
everywhere, the thing that impressed me most
was the. all Importance of each -man In his
place: the Importance of that man both know-
Ing his work and feeling it a matter of keen
personal pride to do It aa well as it could
pofsibly be done. - ~ '
You are doing your duty well and faithfully
in peace. Remember if ever, which may
Heaven forbid, war comes, it will depend upon
you and those like you whether ; the people
of thU country are to hold their heads higher
or to hang them in Ehame. I hope that no
such crisis will ever occur., but I have entire
faith that if it ever does occur you will r|jÂ«
level to any demand' that may â¢', be .made
upon you and that* by the way you r train
yourselves and are trained In time or peace
you will fit yourselves to do well should war
arise. 7 , \u25a0 :
LESSON. FRpM HERO'S LIFE.
Now a special word to the officers. Captain
Arnold as a boy you witnessed the great
fight of thÂ» Merrlmac, when .she came out
to Hampton Roads, sunk the Congress and
the Cumberland and the. next day met her
match In the Monitor. That : was a fight
fought with great honor for our people. The
Cumberland sank with her flags flying and
her grins firing while her decks were \u25a0 awash,
and as " the water was shallow her -flag still
floated from the mast after ehe had gone down.
The \u25a0 captain of the Congress met his death
In the fight, winning an epitaph -which de
serves to be remembered forever In the Amer
ican navy. His name was Joe ; Smith, and'
his father, an old navy officer, was In Wash
ington.-When'word was brought to him that
his son's \u25a0 ship \ had surrendered, he answered
simply.- "Then' Joe Is dead.','.-:- , ' \u25a0 > ,'\u25a0

RIGHTLY HELD
Suitor of Little Maria 31.
Fisher of Oakland Said
to Be of the^ Nobility
FATHER- IS . A BARON
Viconde de Villa Verde Says
He Left Portugal Because
of Political Troubles
If no obstacle is set in the way the
marriage of the Viconde de Villa Verde
of Portugal and Maria iL Fisher, the
18-yÂ«ar-oid daughter of a West Oak-
Land restaurateur, it will be solemnized
this evening .in Oakland, as told exclu
sively iv The* Call of yesterday.
Any doubt regarding the right of the
groom 10 the tille he wears may be
cast aside, for those who have been in
troduced to him believe him to be the
Viconde de Villa Verde, the son of a
distinguished 'courtier. Baron de For
.nellos, who has the distinction of be
ing a very close friend of his Majesty
King Charles of Portugal.
The Baron is one of the most esteem
ed of men, old, wealthy and possessing
the entire confidence of the King.
wisher pere assisted the Viconde to
obtain the marriage license â that is, he
lent to the County Clerk's office with
the nobleman when the application for
the license was made. This step was
taken on account of the extreme youth
of his daughter, who. providing there
is no. slip between the cup anÂ£ the lip,
â¢will at any rate be allied to one of the
most honored families known to Por
tvipuese. . ;) â¢V.
Viconde de Villa Verde is past 40
years of age. He is a widower and out
of a family of many boys has but two
living, who are under the guardianship
of their grandfather, the Baron, and'
eVp sTudying in Lisbon, i
That the Viconde is of pleasant -ad
dress is attested by the friends he has
made in San Francisco,' numbers of
them haying been generous in their
prompt assistance. .*Â« .
HIS STORY \OT DOUBTED.
The Btory he has told of his leaving
Portugil is not doubted. HÂ« attributes
his departure to political entangle
ments. He left with a passport duly
signed by the authoritiesand which has
been teen and examined by people in
this city. He has seen military ser
vice and is a captain in the Engineer
CÂ° r P s - .... . â
Speaking of him, Manuel F. M. Trl
gueiro. proprietor, and manager of A
Uniao Portugueza. the local paper of
, the Portuguese of San Francisco, said:
'â¢ I hey*. no doubt at all 'as to his being: enti
' tied to the title, and of his being the eon of
tie distinguished Barcn <5e Fornellos. It is a
fact that he is a captain in the engineers.
Twelve yrars ago he obtained the sanction of
the Portuguese Minister of ' War to Join the
expedition which fought Gungunhana in South
Africa The Viconde was wounded in botn
lfÂ« and arms and to this day the scars are
there to tell their grim story. H> distinguished
him&elf on the field, showing exeat bravery.
He has a pension, which, however, is small,
being but *25 a month. The Vieonde is a
man of the highest attainments, * rernark
ab'e llcsuict. but from his actions I do not
thlr.k him mentally, responsible for his deeds.
WAS AIDED BY FRIEXDS.-
He intcrmed rr.e that be had lost some
Koney fumbling Â»Â« Oakland." It could not
ha- c bei" \u25a0 much, for he haÂ» had to taJfce ad
vantage of the generosity of eeveraJ persons
ln He l 'hM V> be*n M&cMn* the, Portuguese lan
iruaV* in Oaldasd. and I nscoamended him to
SÂ£ cirtwHe BÂ«nlnÂ«iry. Menio Park, where
they required a teacher or Portuguese. Tfao
announcement cf his approaching â¢Â«^"Â« c
cam* as & great surprise. From ail that has
trari^'red I do sot think him responsible.
Among those *ho belriended him ar* Dr t . J.
de S. Bettcncourt. M. B. Caxnara and V. U
de FigTieredo- *--'
Dr. Bettencourt said that Viconde dÂ«
Villa Verde presented two letters of
introduction to him. one from the Por
tuguese Consul at Boston. Mass.. and
one from a well known medical man. on
his arrival, in San Francisco about two
months ago. J^ ">"- --â¢>.-
Dr. Bettencourt said that if, there
exists any doubt as to the right of the
man to the title it will be settled on the
'return in a few weeks of Dr. Duarte,
the Portuguese Consul at San Fran
cisco. While expressing his astonish
ment on learning the Viconde's ap
proartitfig marriage to the very young
miss. Dr. Bettencourt admitted that the
Viconde had appeared to him to act
ratner strangely. Â£T; ?..c. : St:
The British consulate Is at present In
charge of the Portuguese consulate,
and, though nothing is known there of
the Ylconde, It was saW that his .let
ters come to the consulate.

YOUNG WITNESS
AGAINST WADE
Prosecution Galls Command-
W of the iil-Fated Ben
nington to the Stand
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, Oct. 31. â At the court
martial of Ensign Charles T. Wade, of
the Bennlngton at Mare Island navy
yard to-day the prosecution, which has
"occupied two days of the trial, an
nounced that it will conclude at noon
to-morrow. The evidence Introduced
so far would tend rather to clear than
to convict "Wade.
The prosecution placed on the wit
ness stand Commander Luclen Young,
who told of the orders given Lieuten
ant Tates, the executive officer, of the
Bennlngton on the morning of the 'ex
plosion. Young said that Just at 9
o'clock, as he was on the chip's gang
plank preparatory to going ashore, he
told Yates to get up a good head . of
steam in boilers "C" and "D," but to go
slow with boilers "A" and "B," as the
ship could make seven knots an hour
with these "C" and "D."
Lieutenant Commander Hals ted of
the Chicago, who was a member, of the
THE SAN-:FRA^
board of inquiry that convened at San
Diego, and- one of the leading wit
nesses In the ". Young, case; -.was' next
called. :^?. i v ; '\u25a0â¢ .- ;' i ":- \r '\u25a0 : : 't
Halsted's r evidence' wasKvinuch^the
same as. that introduced in: the Young
case! When he started to identify <some
photos of the boilers taken .after the
explosion Commander Roller of the
board objected, as "the board, had pre
viously decided that none of the evi
dence used at the board of inquiry
would be admitted. '
"At the conclusion of- Halsted's testi
mony Rear Admiral Glass, president
of. the board, announced that, the. board
would not consider any expert testi
mony... This seems to mean that Wade
\u25a0will not be found guilty of neglect, as
It will require such testimony to prove
this charge.
A. J. Worthena, coal passer, who was
also on the stand in the Young case,
was called. He" stated that he ' had
been on duty in the after fire room, but
that five minutes before the explosion
he was sent on deck to find the boiler
maker. He created considerable Inter
est by telling: of a conversation .be
tween a number of the ; engine-room
crew a few minutes. previous to the ex
plosion. Judge .Advocate West' ob
jected strenuously to this conversa
tion being admitted as evidence, but
the members ; of the. court thought It
might tend to "bring, out ./ some new
points in the case, and it did. Worthen
said, that there had been considerable
complaint among the- men stationed
ihere . as to the condition of \u25a0:'. boiler
"Ji." as the boiler .would act - queerly.
A few minutes before the explosion De
Courtnanl. the oiler, who had been
placed on duty as a water tender, told
Fireman Holland to fire up. boiler "B."
Holland said: "I am afraid of that
boiler. You would better send for the
bollermaker." De ,'Courtnani insisted
that the boiler; was ; all right and ; told
Holland to fire up. but '- he asked the
witness to go up on deck and find the
bollermaker. The explosion came three
minutes ' afterward.; .Worthen s further
testified that he had not not seen Wade
in the engine-room on the ; morning' of
the explosion.
The Bennlngrton" went out of commis
sion at theYnavyJyara J this afternoon!
The nin ety men ; on board .were escorted
to their new, quarters 'on! the Independ
ence ' by; the ; Mare Island : station's band.

\u25a0 Four night meetings and a significant

Fathered during the noon hour to listen
to the message of purity and clean gov

rying to the people of San Francisco. The
size of the crowd that listened to Part
ridge would have been even larger had
lhe candidates voice been strong enough
to carry. Many .who were beyond hearing
(Stayed a few minutes in a vain endeavor
to edge nearer the speaker.
"Honesty in government and a square
deal for everybody, man or corporation, is
What I stand for," declared Mr. Partridge
to the assembled workingmen. **1 am
looking for honest men, and when there
is an opportunity such will be placed in
responsible positions in my administra
tion. 1 say my administration, for 1 know
our ticket will win, and we'll sweep -the
grafters and thugs- off the face of the
earth. Any man, however, who says that
the honest workingmen of $an Francisco
are allied with this crew in its efforts to
break up my meetings lies, and" knows
he lies." '
Mr. Partridge's, remarks were heartily
deceived by the crowd and he was warm
ly cheere.d, while many of the men
â¢crowded forward and shook .his hand.
Cheers for Mayor" Schmitz were also
riven, but- there was no'. tendency jnanl
iVfeted saye c toÂ° give', the fusion, leader a
fair hearing. ; .;.-.
The first of the night meetings was held
at Legaxi Hall. c at San Drurto road" and

fortably filled, considering the area from
which the audience was gathered. The
reception accorded the leader was grati
,'fying. . L*ouis Ferrari presided* c^fflcjently

Mr. Partridge made a brief speech, .tell
ing his hearers of the condition of the
â¢ district and the improvements that were
needed, but which, he said, they would
not obtain if the present administration
continued. ln power. He told his heaters
that he was controlled, by no political
boss or corporation, and closed with_ the
promise to give all a square deal.
On Friday' evening 'the voters of San

3 Out in tht* nelifhborhoon you have certainly

: I feel convinced that you will express your
'\u25a0\u25a0disapproval on election day. I have already
f r*fo<inte.l the facts of Xhe Mayor's outrageous
veto of the rock inifihiiiK and blasting ordi
' nance. You remember hGvr the Supervisors
r*FEwJ a bill making H un!awrol to Â»et oft
> fclaFts or crush rock in this neighborhood. bÂ»
;*ause you proved that It was a nuisance which
*Jepreciat*d th* value Â«f your . property, and
was besides offensive and dangerous to life
#nd Jlm'j. You will not forget, either, that the
Major vetoed,, thif* ordinance. In spite Of your
.prottate and i>etitions. Nor can you forget
â¢ that it was openly charged at the time that
thore way a secret arrangement between the
-firm which was engaged In the rock crushing
*nd the man who is the real master of the ad
ministration.
-\ All your petitions have been ignored be
cause you don't belong to the gang. When
. fou wantfi tights on A!\ara-5o street and at the
.corner of Jersey and Sanchez streets you <iid
â¢riot even receive a reply to your petition. You
'- Â»*ed a primary . school and you get a little
. temporary building, although there is more
than a miKicn dollars in me treasury .for the
construction of schoolhouiwe. The taxpayers
â¢ are payirg 34 per cent on that money, but
they are not getting the schools.
U You have done all you could, with no help
or Â«yen your Jurt dues rrom the admlnlstra
-tion. The Noe Valley Improvement Club is
using Hb best endeavors to get the things you
i.foii but it is not a political organization and
â¢ nothing but politics has any influence with
this admlnstraton. The good of the people or
the Improvement Â©I a neighborhood is a slight
ihtrg in their eyes Â«-hni i-umpared with the
Interest of some petty precinct "boss.
'Now I am going to ccc to It that politics
*hall not cut any figure In my administration.
I tn going to de\~otc myself to making this
city beautiful and attractive, a place for hoihcs
anil home loving poople. I am going to see
that the money of the people is expended In
' improving the etreel*. making them fit to
travel over axnl In lighting them at night; in
Mvr \u25a0 parks and new schoolhousee. a library
and a new hospital. With an . administration

was cheered to the echo by the throngs
that had patiently awaited the coming:
of,, the candidate. Far out Into the

E.F. Tread well, who "delivered 'a, -brief
but effective speech upon the misdeeds
r>f the present administration. Dr. TV
8. W. Lei and and Walter Gallagher
fclso addressed the meeting. _.' ";
Mr. Partridge was cheered on being
presented, and after quiet was 'restored
spoke in.part as follows: "â¢-..' 'â¢\u25a0\u25a0
There is no necessity at this late day of
talking to men who are with UB. They cannot
be turned from taelr stern purpose by any last
weak lies. There Is -no sen* c either in at
tempting .to reason with those who arÂ«- set
against us. But I want to say a word ko
those who have not yet definitely . made up
their minds, tho*e who really want the right
thing-, but are not yet sure where It \u25a0is to bt
found. It seems strange that there are any
such men; strange that we can, yet rind In
dividuals who arc not convinced that . the
present administration is a' disrrace to the
city and a detriment to our prosperity and
progress. \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 ' ..'..â¢
To such men I -would like to ask the ques
tion: What* the matter with San Francisco
anyhow? Why is it that, we .have'- a bad"name
all over the I'nlted States? Why do the
newspapers and magazines of the \u25a0 "country
class us with St. Louis and Philadelphia? * Do
you not know that the press -of the whole
republic is filled with tales of the shameless
way affairs are conducted in San Francisco?
Do you not know that all over the East they
point to this city as an example of the evils
that flow from the domination of a corrupt
and 'delfish boss?
Now to my mind the best politics is no poll
tics. By . that I mean that an administration
which will be guided by lhe one purpose of
giving the people an honest and efficient gov
ernment need have no fear of anybody. On
the other hand, the very effort to perpetu
ate the power of an administration . defeats
Itself. For in civic affairs devotion to selfish
politics in<-ans neglect of- municipal buslnes?
and brings Us own Inevitable punishment.
The time is rapidly coming. in American cit
ies when to be a successful politician a man
must not be a politician at all.
Now the present administration has beer
in office for two terms and seeks a third. How
is ft to 'be judged â by its performances or by
its promises? I think most men in San
.Francisco are convinced that the charges of
corruption are true; but even conceding that
they are false, the fact remains, that every
policy of theirs has been dictated by the
single aim of perpetuating themselves in of
fice, with never a thought for the welfare of
the people. It would be difficult, indeed, to
pick cut half a dozen men In all their ap
pointments, who are even reasonably fit for
the places tpey hold. The very last man of
them -has been chosen not for his fitness, but
because he is useful to the boss. And that
boss has the faculty of surrounding himself
with the most Inefficient, futile, shiftless
crowd that has ever followed any politician
in San Francisco. Whether he has no Judg
ment of men or whether he has no use j for
followers of fair intelligence I do not know,
but I do know that the men he has always
put to the front have been the men of least
consideration, even among his very doubtful
adherents. No wonder the city's business is
in hopeless confusion; no wonder .we are the
Jest and the scorn of the whole United States.
At the conclusion of the meeting- in
Browne's Hall Partridge hurried ; to
Powell and Sutler streets, where he ad-j
dressed a meeting of the colored men,
who have had enough of the Ruef ad
ministration. The f uslon 'â¢ candidate 1
told the "< voters of the failure of the
present administration to make San
Francisco respected and prosperous and
told them of the complete tying- up of
all municipal money for improve
ments. .
The chairman. F. H. Atkinson, was
introduced by V. A. ileade. Mr. Atkin
son in his opening- remarks said | ' that
the first official act of Mayor Schmilz
was the turning out of office of every
colored man employed by the Phelan
administration. :;-
SCHMITZ SHOWS
GREAT ENERGY
'Mayor Schmitz began the last week of
his fr;Aitic campaign last night with
renewed vigor. Although his voice was
very hoarse from overwork, yet he did
not give up, but addressed six meetings
during the course of the evening. The
entire day he spent visiting among the
voters of the city, and during the noon
hour he talked at two gatherings. He
was everywhere greeted with cheers and
assured his friends that he would win.
Yet with all his assurances, the Mayor is
not overlooking a single vote that he
thinks can be secured for his party, and
his actions are those of a man who is
not so sure of victory as he pretends.
The Mayor has made a hard campaign,
and if he is defeated he will have the
satisfaction of knowing that he fought
well, lie has addressed meetings In every
part of the city, and he has made as
many as fifteen speeches in one â¢ day.
Withal he has stood the strain well, al
though many other members on the
Union Labor party ticket, not one of
whom has attempted half as much as
has the Mayor, have been forced I to re
tire at times for a needed rest.'
Last night Mayor Schmitz spent his
time urging, the citizens to vote . the
Union Labor ticket straight. - He asked
particularly that he be given a Board
of Supervisors and a -District Attorney.
With their assistance' he promised
many needed reforms. He again stated
that the entire : amount of the bonds
placed upon the market' had been sold
and that the Supervisors would not
spend all of the money in improve
ments because they feared he would
get some of the credit. He assured the

PROTEST AGAINST

Liquor Men in Mass Meeting Declare the
Added Tax \ Would Be an Injustice.
Issue a Formal f Reply to the Arguments Set
of Saloons.
Under direction \u25a0â¢ of the joint campaign
committee of, the. Retail- Grocers, the
California ,; LLiquorr r Dealers' . Association j
and the Knights of. the .Royal. Arch, aj
mass-meeting of the liquor dealers of this !
city" was held yesterday afternoon at the
Alhambra . Theater in opposition to the
proposed $500 yearly retail liquor- license,
which will be submitted to ;the voters on
! November 7. - Five hundred men attended
the meeting, addresses being made by
representatives of the organizations
which had. charge. The arguments of the
speakers were In the main directed to the
business interests of the liquor men and
in defense of the business as a recognized,
legitimate industry. â¢,%.-\u25a0
Members of the joint committee and Its
officers were vice presidents, as follows:
Chairman, E. I* -Wagner; vice chairman,
T.. J. Hurley; secretary. Harry A. Keeler;
assistant secretary, I. H. Spiro: treasurer.

'urges dealers to polls.
Frank Dunn, president of the California
Liquor Dealers' Association, opened the
meeting arid presented E. L. Wagner as
chairman. He said:
We have one common cause In this fight, and
it is to the interest of every one of us to be
at the polls on election day, and to bring our
friends there. Obnoxious cyanks and fanatics
are trying to ruin your Property. The entire
State Is looking at this struggle. High license
Is enly i step toward prohibition, j
Theodore Lunstedt. for the Knights
of the Royal Arch, said he felt it an
honor to appear for that, organization,
which, he declared, had taken the posi
tion that the liquor traffic should be
placed on a legitimate basis and that
the Royal Arch, by- its methods, had
won favor throughout the State. ' He
believed that, lii view; of the Federal
impost on the traffic, no local communi
ty had the fight to put a prohibitive tax
on 'â¢'\u25a0 the ' business^â a tax,' which." the
speaker said,' would -In many ' cases
amount to a " virtual confiscation of
vested Interests and the. rights of the
common people. Lunstedt declared
that, if the $500 license replaced the
existing $84 license, one-third of the
licenses would be surrendered. 1000
stores would be vacated and 3000 per
sons would be thrown out of employ
ment. He said many of the little
places would close and the big ones
would thrive, but 'he believed the little
fellow was entitled to as much consid
eration as the big one.
James P.' Jackson, president of
the Bottlers' Protective Association,
pledged 2500 to 3000 votes against
high license from that organization.
Herbert Choynski of the California
Liquor Dealers' Association, contended
that the proposed license increase was
a vicious measure, suggested by un
fair fanatics. John P. Hurley made an
appeal for the Retail Grocers' Asso
ciation to fight the proposition of high
license. (Choynski read, as a reply to
the High License* Association's argu
ment, the following:
The High License Association of Ban Fran
cisco has issued a pamphlet In' favor cf the
fanatical attempt to impose an unjust burden
upon one class of the business* community;
that man for man. morals for morals, Uecency
for decency, integrity for integrity, virtue for
virtue, civic pride and loyal patriotism for
any like qualities possessed by their critics,
compares more than, favorably with a like
number selected from any trade, calling, pro
fession or business In this city.
Not all ministers,' doctors, lawyers, mer
chants, bankers or statesmen are morally per
fect; but . the . occasional one who lapses from
grace should not cause an outcry against the
great, number who hold to the hard and stead
fast - rules of. decent and '\u25a0 organized society;
and If -an occasional liquor dealer shall com
mit an offense it does not justify an attack
upon the greater number of men of -family
and social and business honor engaged In that
calling. _<~Â£B3Sn \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0- .
WANT CONSIDERATION". ,
This trade haa contributed to the support of
the National Government in the way of taxes
on beer anil whisky the enormous sum of
$3,582,820,524 during the past forty years, a sum
which means 57 pir cent <of the entire cost of
the civil 'war. and 85 per cent of the combined
cost \u25a0 of ' the 'Army and Navy Pension Depart
ment for the same- period of time, and be
cause'lt has patiently submitted to these ex
actions without protest is np reason 'why It*
voice should not \u25a0be - heard -in opposition to a
vicious and * unjust * measure. Â«.' All of - the big
men of this country's history, who \u25a0 have
studied and understood the question,' hav-i as
serted that "temperance, like other virtue*, is
net produced by . lawmaker*, but by the influ
ence, of education and morality. '.' This was
the utterance of such men aa Horatio Sey
mour. John.Qulncy Adams. Thomas Jefferson
and ' Abraham Lincoln. It Is only the narrow
minded, and inexperienced fanatic who knows
nought of what -be speaks, that Insists upon
prescribing a rule for the guidance of every
one but himself, and makes merchandise out of
his opposition to an appetite that he has no
present disposition for. \u25a0â¢ - Â»
Bishop Potter. BlshOD Hall. Bishop Neelv

minded and eminent ' churchmen ' have studied
the saloon question, and with a full knowl
edge (not even Inquired, into by our small
divines) have - Mid <of the opponents of sa
loons ;. that "'many well-intentioned Christian
people are wasting much activity in the pur
suit â¢of methods - and maxims concerning the

have \u25a0 the same enjoyments . from life that hi*
more privileged brother has In his club and

conducted as . legitimate * business ventures
What possible excuse, therefore, exists for
imposing on them any \u25a0 tax not - exacted from
all- other ; classes of business? It cannot be

I take thins* for granted, without ntudylag the

PENITENT THIEF
ROBS ACTRESS
> GREENWICH, Conn.. Get. 31.-^Vlola
Allen. Â°thoÂ° actress, was fobbed of a
one-thousand-dollar diamond ring Â°. In
Greenwich while visiting: 0 her brother,
Charles W. Allen,Â°a few days -agro. The
thief afterward became repentant and
left a note with the .address where the
ring: could Â°be recovered, and the
strangest part of all,- with "the note
were thre^, crisp Â°$100 bills, the amount
for which the ring: had'been pawned.
The ring: was recovered by detectives
of the New York police bureau at a
loan association on Fourth avenue. The
facts were kept quiet, hoping that the
culprit might" be discovered, and the
story . has. just leaked out to-day.
Charles Â°W. Allen is manager for - his
sister and has a fine residence close to
the Indian Harbor Yacht .Club house.
The grounds are in.closed by a' high
fence, so that, the thief who; entered
the house probably came by 'water ana
went away in a boat. -
Two nights after the robbery Miss Alien
found tucked away In the lower part of
her jewel case a note, written In a coarse
hand 01! brown paper, on which It was
stated that the : burglar had given the
ring to a friend to be disposed of; that he
had secured $500 on i t at a loan associa
tion on Fourth avenue. New York,; and
that the burglar had since become repent
ant and bo returned the money, not dar
ing to redeeni the ring- for fear of detec
tion. Alongside the .note lay the three
WOO bills. .;_

THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST GRAFT. .
IN spite of the attempt to lug in outside matters, and to inject new
issues to divert public attention,. the Mayor and Mr. â¢ Ruef have
not succeeded in making their campaign, any thing but an attempt
to perpetuate the government of graft in San .Francisco. This justi
fies Mr. Partndgc'sdcciarafion that, he proposed" to select the battle
field and make his opponents fight on= it. -.'" \rj -I â¢' \;j/
In all the weeks of the struggle, neither the "Mayor <npr. Mr;. Ruef
has specifically answered a single specific. charge made against tli err
administration of city affairs. : They have. .answered every charge
simply by ascribing motives to those who make them. They have
found motives for the newspapers, motive?' for the Grand Jury, mo
tives for the clergymen, motives for the private, citizens, who oppose
them. It is noteworthy that in each tase the Mayor and Ruef have
ascribed to others exactly the sam.e. motives that actuate themselves.
It is. impossible for them to conceive in others a disinterested or
patriotic motive, for they have : no\S-nch motive themselves.
It fs a peculiarit}- of the grafter that he smothers his famine
smitten conscience under the conclusion that all men are like him
self, looking no higher than he looks, doing no better than he does,
grafting as he grafts. This peculiarity of the semi-criminal con
science accounts for the nature .'of .the defense put forward by the
proponents .of graft. They are 'quite. sure that they are as good as
others' which is -their way of saying that others are no better than
they. oThis gives them the coufage/of their conduct.
They regard their grafting .#> the normal and proper tise of
the opportunities of office, and. n6;doubt, are really hurt when other
men object to their ways and fig'ht/tjiem. This truthful view of their
warped and seamed; mentality eriaibl-es us to give the Mayor credit
for perfect sincerity.. He sincerely believes that farming out the op
portunities of government to a grafter is legitimate. He has be
come accustomed tor t by usage and tolerance, and is really hurt in
his feelings because others think it wrong. Mr. Ruef is of the
cpinion that it is right for hini.tQ take .a fee from a citizen for his
contrbKof any one of.the city bear ds.- .His friends say openly on
the street that this was done before/ only in other days the boss met
his clients in a saloon and- <lid not coyer, the transaction under the
pretense of doing legal business and; getting for it a lawyer's fee.
These apologists of Mr. Ruef't^llljow much better it is to go to
s. lawyer's office and arrange matters; under cover of a professional
service with an attorney than it was \to go into the back room of a
saloon to do the same thing and get the same result, and then l be ex
pected to ''set 'em up" 'when ' you "cameiout. These apologists see
nothing wrong nor any thing subversive of decent government in the
act itself, whether the scene be a swipe shop or a lawyer shop. They
simply. declare it is a question of gentility. They expect citizens to
submit to it. no matter in which place the boss does business, but to
appreciate the difference between the .plaices in which the business
is done, and for the sake of ..that difference to support the Mayor
and Mr. Ruef for re-election... -" .- V. .'\u25a0.;'
But the decent citizens repudiate the act itself. They repudiate
a grafting city government whether the graft is done in a swipe hole
or a lawyer's office. Such citizens' have decided that graft must
cease, and that the more respectable the. place where it is carried
on the greater its danger. AVhen Gbyernof': Folk was here he told
of a scene, at a patriotic banquet in St. Louis. "The Star-Spangled
Banner"' had been played and sung, and; one prominent guest with
tears in his eyes exclaimed, "How I love, my flag! I would
gladly die for it." â¢â¢ â¢ . / : . .;. â¢{. yV- '
In a few months that hyper-p^triot was 'in the penitentiary. He
proved to be a criminal grafter in the city government. He was at
the same time a highW respectable citizen, -w-ho stayed home nights
and did not graft nor drink in saloons, and he. wanted to -die" for. the
fiÂ±g. while desecrating every sentiment for which the flag floats. '
The argument made for Mr. Ruef and the Mayor is simply that
they have gone in and rescued graft from a saloon and relocated it
in respectable surroundings, in a lawyer's office, "and have covered
it with flowers and a lawyers fee. .Now we grant :that if it is ad
mitted that graft is legitimate, and that this .city cannot, be run
without it, -. the -Mayor and Ruef have done a good .and praiseworthy
thing. If graft is institutional and inherent and necessary, it should
not be carried on in a saloon. But we do not grant that graft is
legitimate. It is criminal. It makes criminals. It requires, crimes
against the constitution, the charter and the ordinances for, its pros
ecution. It must have stuffing of the ballot-box and corruption of the
franchise for its support. -~ Its fountain head is in crime and. it never
rises above its source whether It is consummated in a saloon or a
lawyer's office. To the; decent citizen the place is nothing. .. It is the
act; itself that he abhors and proposes to prevent. This is the reason
that decent citizens^ will support" Mr. Partridge.. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0
THE â END, OF AUTOCRACY.
THE stubborn hold on ihÂ£ mind and conscience of the Czar, so
long heldJby the Procurator of- the Holy Synod, has-been broken.
Physical fear haS overcome othe f superstitious cowardice of the
autocrat. Facing angry students? professors, mechanics, mujiks and
boyars, while his empire rocked like G acfrail craft in a storm, the Czar :
a prisoner in Peterhof, with theo^upplies of his table cut off by a
general blockade, has^surrendered. His weak and feeble sop of a
powerless douma, elected by a^rdestricted Constituency, has melted
away, and he has been compelled t6 surrender to the' people the
essentials of civil liberty, the inviolability of the person, and freedom
of conscience, speech and, assembly. â¢ These rights carry all others
with them. Upon them ride habeas corpus, open judicial trial for al
leged offenses, and all the rights of person and property.
After all, the revolution was accomplished with but little pres
ent bloodshed or suffering, o and its best guarantee of permanence is
tlie complete overthrow ofÂ°the po\\;er of the orthodox church. With
all the restrictions put upon them, the writings of Tolstoi and Maxim
Gorky have cleaved the thick skulls 3 of the Russian populace and
found within the tinder ready to be fired by the spark* of liberty.
But it would not have come about now had it not been c for Japan.
The real emancipators ofcÃussia are Togo and^his sailors and Oyama
and his soldiers. The Samurar spirit and bushido haye o not only
saved Japan, but have -given 2 to Russia the inestimable blessing of
civil and religious liberty. Â° 7^;.*^f Hir^! "
Immediately the constructive 0 geriius pi .'Russian statesmanship
will be taxed to the utmost to "build on the new foundation a new
Russia. The day and the night of holy ikons are gone by. They
will no longer make the soldiers content tp'die for the Grand Dukes
and the peasants content to starve for the maintenance of autocratic
vice and splendor. The Russian people are coming to their own.

MY GRAZVDSIRE'S Â«TUNE*Â» OF CHEER
MY grandsire could not sing a. song,
nor c'en one air could troll-
God left the music out his voice
and set it in his soul â
No "ear for music" he possessed; myself
have heard him say
He knew "Old Hundred" by it* words.
and in no other way.
And yet when worries pressed him sore
he'd hum a song of cheer.
And if you'd care the "tune" to know
.you'll find it written here:
"Do do do do do do si do, do do" do do
}". ; re do."
He often mixed the re and si, or lost them
quite, I know, â¢\u25a0 \
But still his smile illumed the words on
which his spirit fed: \u25a0
"While God Is keeping constant watch,
what need a mortal dread?"
You might have smiled to hear that
"tune," but we who knew him well
Held that it entered heaven's gate, the
anthems there to swell.
For well we knew, -who knew him well.
that in his kindly breast
Was music hid that stammering lips have
' never here expressed.
He spoke no word of discontent, his life
was like a rune.
And when the skies had blacket.- turned
. he hummed the more his "tune":
"Do do do do do do si do, do do do do re
do"â
To hear that most absurd of airs the an
\u25a0 gels paused. I know.
For aye the words were Just the same.
and aye for grace they plead:
"While God is keeping constant watch,
what need a mortal dread?"
Long are the years since he went out
where many mansions be.
And far my feet have wandered from the,
way he showed to me;
Yet if some day, o'erworn and tired, unto
my "home" I turn,
I know that near the foremost row my
grandsire I'll discern: . .
And as I sit with those who creep the
pearly portal through
I'll list and list In hope to hear the "tune"
that once I knew: .
"Do do do do do do si do, do do do do re
; do"â
E'en if the si and re are mixed 'twill help
the choir, I trow, c
Although I think he'lt Change the words
that here on earth he said:
"While God is keeping constant watch,
nor man nor angels dread."
FABLE OK THE TWO SHEEP.
Once upon a time there was a charming
Mamma Sheep who had two sons, and
,one of them filled her with pride, but the
other gave her. a pain. The' one that
fitted her with pride was white, just too
beautifully white to be touchedâ so white
that his mamma had to handle him with
her gloves on; so white, indeed, that he
would not for anything have a gone Into
the mire, not even to help another sheep
who was In trouble. - ' ;
But her other son was black â oh, most
reprehensibly black!â and he did not mind
the mire, but would go "into it to help an
other sheep who was in trouble, or even
fo\the fun of It; and he drank of the .red
waters found in the mire, and gamboled
with the ewe lambs, and, oh. he was very
shocking, indeed! -. Â° *
So the Mamma Sheep called her two
sons unto her and addressed the Black
Sheep: . * \u25a0 , ii \
"Oh, my loved son," she said, "I have
heard that you. get out with the boys and
paint things. Is it true?" .* - . .
I "Indeed, it Is. ; mamma," , the White
Sheep interposed, for Tie was sore dis
tressed, lest the Black Sheep should not
be punished sufficiently; "he gets out
with the boys and sets 'em up. He is not
like me, who will not be treated because
I might have to spend the money to treat
In return."
"And I hear," the Mamma Sheep con
tinued, "that you disport yourself with
giddy ewes who are Quite shocking. Is
it true?" â¢ â¢
"You bet he does, mamma," the White
Sheep hastily remarked; "and he spends
money with them, instead of saving it
like me." .\u25ba .
"Alas, my son, .my. son!" the Mamma
Sheep cried. Â°-\Â«r
But the Black Sheep said nothing, for
he knew he had, done wrong, and it was
not In his nature to retaliate on his broth
er by delivering himself of a brief ora
tion on the Sin of Selfishness.
So the Black Sheep went his unfortu
nate way and became an Awful Example,
but the White Sheep continued what he
was and eventually was recognized as a
Prominent Citizen.
Moralâ There are Black Sheep whose of
fenses cannot be condoned; but. on the
contrary, there are White Sheep who
ought to be knocked on the head with a
club. " \u25a0 â

He never raised a single hand
. To give the Lord a lift.' ,
In "meeting" he would edify
The ones who sadly stray.
And said the Lord would point them
all Â»
Unto a better way;
But though the world had need of him,
. .And times were out .of Joint,'.
He never raised a finger once

BAZELLI MAKES
POOR WITNESS
Robu s t Tenor Is I Garrulous i
While Testifying at; the
Trial o| Julio Z.Uriburiii
TETRAZZINI RECALLED
Prosecution on the Second
Charge* of Felony Embez
zlement Closes â¢ Its Case
The case for the prosecution at the
trial of Julio Z. Uriburu on. the second
charge .of felony embezzlement pre
ferred against him by Madamo JLuisa
Tetrazzini, the diva, -was closed yes
terday afternoon and the first witness
tor tiie defense w>as examined. It is
expected that the case will go to the
jury this afternoon. \;o
When the trial was resumed yester
day afternoon Madame Tetrazzini was
'recalled and Questioned as to the re
ceipt for 2000 francs alleged to have
been, sent by the defendant to Sorelle
Dameno, Milan, on March'2l. When she
received the cablegram that the money
had not been received she asked the de
fendant to go with her to the Swiss-
American Bank to see about it, but he
declined to go and she went herself.
George Bazelli, the robust tenor, made^
aÂ° garrulous^ witness. Instead of, an:'
swering yes or no to the questions put
to him he would always start In with
a long explanation. Interpreter Glover
checked him repeatedly, but it 'had no
effect." He testified to having heard
conversations between the diva and o the
defendant as .to the money and de
fendant having told her he would be re
sponsible. The defendant had told her
in the presence of the witness that he'
had sent the 2000 francs to Milan. o
" On cross-examination by Attorney
Charles Peery, Bazelli said that he and
Tetrazzini were intimate friends and
he had known the whole of her family.
He was in her apartments on (he night
that defendant was arrested, as she
was sick. He went with the detectives
to Tait'sCafe, where the defendant was
arrested. He denied tliat he went to
Mexico with Tetrazzini after the de-;
fendant's arrest, but said he simply
went as a member of the company.
Acting Captain of Detectives Rey
nolds and Detective Wren testified that
the defendant had admitted to them
having written the receipt for the 2000
francs, and W. H. LÂ°eahy, manager of
the Tlvoli, testified that he had given
the defendant checks to hold for other
members of the opera company.
. J. S.-Wanrell was called-; for 'the de
fense and the trial was continued till

bors to Care for Him
OAKLAND. Oct. 81.â When Henry A.
L^gan. the renegade trustee of the
First FTee Baptist Church, of Oakland,
eloped from this city with sixteen
vear-old Ethel Cook, he deserted a
who for many months after Lo
gran had been discharged from the em
pipy of Castle Bros., commission mer
chants of Sacramento, on suspicion of
having broken into the safe of the
firm, worktd in a factory in San Fran
ifsco to support, her erring husband,
who, through his indulgence In liquor,
bad Incapacitated himself for work-
After his discharge by Castle Bros..
Logan, broken In health, removed to
San Francisco, and In that city his
'vife. who had all her life been accus
tomed to the tendercst care, laid aside
her pride and secured a pesition, that
she might support the husband-
Through the influence of friends of
his wife. Logan secured the position
with a local roofiing company which
he -held at the time he left Oakland,
and as soon as he had saved a little
money he rewanicd his wife's devo
tion by deserting her and leaving her
penniless.
Through friends of Mrs. Logan It
has been iearncd that until he came to
this city Logan never provided r a home
for his wife, other than a furnished'
room, and that for tfte first time since
marriage, husband, wife g.nd child,
lived together In Oakland. Up to .the
time "Logan came to Oakland his son
had been cared for- by the parents of
the wronged wife. â¢ â¢
A touching incident' in the sad case
was the efforts of Logan's son, Ray
mond Logan, agred 8 years, fb contrib
ute to the support of his mother after
his father had fled from the city Â°with
Â£thel Cook. â¢â¢ The little fellow, deter
mined to as far as possible , ease the
burden resting on his mother's 5 should
ers, vnrote little circulars, asking for
work cutting lawns and sweeping side
walks, and on the day following: his
father's flight from his home dls-"
trlbuted these at the homes of the
neighbors. Ashamed of the name his
father had disgraced, the child simply
signed his first name to the circulars.
and gave his address. c
Logan, taking refuge behind the ex-
Cuse that his attorney has Instructed
him not to talk, still refuses to make
eny statement "regarding the case.

SUGGEST NEW
REQUISITES
FOR HONORS
, , . = - Â° c -o . c
BERKELET, Oct. 81.â In order 'that "spe^
cial encouragement to scholarly effort" o may
be given "capable and' ambitious students,"
the faculty committee on prerequisites baa rec
ommmended to the academic . council the
adoption cf new conditions for the awarding
of * student honors. The recommendations axe
as follows: o T - Â°
"That each department be authorized to offer,
annually subjects or topics ? - for" Independent
study and investigation, Â°. and to recommend
for .honors, with the bachelor's 0 degree, such
students as shall have satisfied the require
ments foro honors. Â° So .
"That the honors awarded be of two' grades,
honors and highest honors'. . . " Â° \u25a0 o â
â¢That the requirements foV honors be' nor
mally as follows: â (a) Every candidate for
honors must pass, in a ' manner - evincing
marked grasp and proficiency, an examination
on tho^ subject or topic which o he offers .for
honors, and must "present such written papers
as may be called "for. (p) Every, candidate for
honors, in addition to passing the jsxamina
tloa for honors, must complete, iti a 'thorough
ly satisfactory' manner, â¢ fifteen units of upper
d'ivlslon work in the department from which
he desires the recommendation.' (c) Applica
tions for candidacy for honors should be pre-
Bented as soon as possible after entering the
upper division. Xo application" will be rÂ«ce,lved
later than eight months' before graduation. .
â¢That<*he acades'c council establish a stand
ing committee eof seven members on .honors,
whose duty it shall be to report from time to
time on . matters concerning -'uniformity "of
standard "and the co-ordinatloji of the o requlre
ments of the several Â°departnients." ' â¢ 0 Â°
â¢ The University Y. <iL C. A. officials have
Issued a report, stating that the current year
promises to be a record-breaking" one In the
matter of finances. Â° The association was $500
in debt on June 1 last,- and since \u25a0 then hasÂ°
raised money to pay for $600 worth ; of J im
provements on Stiles Hall. The association
officials have endeavored to give an . idea of
the usefulness of the association to university
students by inviting all . who are interested
to "imagine that the association was annihi
lated" on August 17, In which case, say the
officials, the result would have been as fol
lows: o O " '.'â''
"Three hundred and fifty prospective free
men would not have received a letter of greet
ing- this summer and an equal number of men
.would not have received assistance In finding
boarding Dlaces. o ; Â° -
"Seventy-three men "; would not have re
ceived $I*lo SO worth of work up to October
1. and as a consequence mora than a SKrore
of men would have abandoned their college
course. â
"Two hundred aad fifty men would not have
found a comfortable place to spend the even
ings of that 'first week* nor o have made life
long acquaintances at their VJolly-ups.' Â° - -
. Â° "Seven hundred and . fifty men ' would have
had to go elsewhere to get acquainted at the
opening 'big reception." ' o :Â°
"One hundred men would "daily be eating
their cold lunches upon the hillside or. In un
sanitary basements. \u0084 _
"Immeasurable amount of accurate informa
tion would not have been given inquirers. . â¢
"One hundred and fifty men every week
would lack ;an ; agreeable place to meet - for
Bible study, mission study or prayer meeting.
"Fifty-two men would have found it difficult
to attend inspiring conferences and conven
tions. . ' -" \u25a0 \u25a0. \u25a0 . -
"Trier* would be nothing to unify religious
effort in the university."
The Musical and Dramatic Club of the Unl- ,
verslty of California announces that the Ellery
Band vlll give a concert at the Greek Theater â¢
on next Friday afternoon." . The programme is j
as follows:

'SMALL PLEADS WITH WIFE.
â¢ Â° c Grant:s 'Examination '"was setÂ°fpr last
Saturday, but was postponed on account
of, the serious illness of Judge Hull.
Miss Small arrived at the courtroom
after nearly all the- "testimony in the
case had been^ heard and for a tinte the
business of th'ecourt was forgotten in
excitement caused by her sensational
entrance^ into the courtroom and the
making of her charges against, her
father. 'ln\, reply to the D questions =of
the Judge, Miss Small' declared that her
father had also placed her, in thcÂ°Mag
deleh Home = in" San. Francisco and had
kept her' there in spite of her wish to
live elsewhere. She declared that =she
was a good girl and {wished to go to
work, but her father had refused to al

â. After hearing the story pt the girl
Judge Hull ordered that Grant- be held

pending her examination, 0 atrs23o, and
these were at once furnished by Lee D.
Windrum and" "\YilliamÂ°Steele,Â°the pro
prietor* of the Golden Gate ; Hotel at
Point Richmond.
Immediately after the adjournment of
the -court Small "approached his wife,
who was still seated in the courtroom*
and.begged her to returnUo him. This
she refused "to do.Â° answering that she
woqld rather go back to trie' Martinez
jail than return with him to Oakland.
\u25a0r'jOTSS' HER MOTHER.
â¢ Finding' that, tut could not o induce his
wife to go with him. Small turned to his
daugher and ,told^ hjer to come home with
him, but she= also refused, declaring that
she intended .to remain with her mother. ;
â¢As soon as the bond for o Mrs. Small.!*
appearance In court had jj been approved
she was ; given her liberty, and mother
and daughter at once went to the Golden
Gate .tfotel. where they will o remain to
Â°gether;- until after the o examination of
Mrs- Small; Grant will be returned to
the â¢ Martinez jail, to await his tria* in
the Superior Court. Xeither Grant nor
Mrs Small have made any denial of
Small's charges, cand both seem resigned
to their fate, whatever 0 It may be.
In reply to the charge made by his
daughter that he had fiept her a prisoner
in his room Small' said to-night;
-"'lt is true that 3 my daughter has been
with meÂ° at the, hotel since last Saturday,
but I did not keepb her confined, and she
had her full liberty at Tall times. I be
lieve 1 ttiat had it Â«ot been for her I would

: . First, in ordÂ«r to re-establish and maintain

withdraw from the union. The) sentiment of
the exchange is that we assist the unions to
maintain their wagts acd hours aa long aa th 9
same are reasonable, but we hold the right to
manage our own business affairs.
The member* of the exchange recognize the
onion in so. far as they have no objection to
their employes Joining their respective, unions,

tended to by -the unions themselves. Â°

Starter Jake Holtman arrived from the
Eastern country on last evening's over
land trains- Jake's ; work with the barrier
at .the different meetings, where he offi
ciated' throughout: the summer, has been
up to his usual high standard.
a Holtman's starting was a revelation to
the New Yorkers at the Pro\*ldence meet-
Ing in \u25a0 July, and many are prophesying
that the 'Jockey. c Club will make him a
proposition before another season has
rolled aroynd. This seems plausible, as
Mars Cassidy, the present starter, ; has
played in anything but good luck, and
complaints have been numerous*. Under
an arrangement made with Dick Dwyer
Jake will dispatch the fields at Oak
land and Ingleislde until January 20.
when he will exchange places with Dwyer
at Los Angeles.
"If all the Â° people about the .Middle
West" and the Far East come out this
way that said they were coming this wfll
be the greatest meeting ever given in Cal
ifornia," said Holtman. Jockeys Shaw,
O'Neill, Knapp. Davis. Hicks and Wiley
.will report from" New York, and Swain,
Alien and Foley are among those that
will make the trip from the Middle West.
Bookmaker Fred Cook, if he has a few
good breaks, will also be out and will
bring along Jockey Nlcol. ' Chambers \u25a0 &
