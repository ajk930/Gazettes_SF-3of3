\u25a0 Without a moment's hesitation Mr. de
Witte explained that \u25a0'. the modification
proposed was merely, a sham,: a "change
of phraseology, a diplomatic attempt at
"dorer la: pilule," and -. asked ' Russia ;to
pay war* tribute under another? name."
He could not accept it, .He; told -Baron
Komura that Russia wanted-peace.' She
had given the proofs in accepting > very
article Involving the issues' upon^which
the war was fought, but she could "fight.
It was concrete and specific 'and it fol
lowed the .lines outlined- in these dis
patches. It offered to withdraw article
i-.ine. providing for the payment byÃus-
Fia of Japan's bill for the cost of, the .war
on condition that Russia . would r accept
article five, which provides . for.' the ces
sion of the. Island "of ; Saphalien, s so , modi
fied as to include an;arrangement,for the
repurchase by Russia" of the northern
iialf of thÂ« island for 1,200.000.000; yen. , In
addition it offered to withdraw^ entirely
articles eleven ' and twelve : (surrender: of
the interned warships and limitation' upon
J'.uss'.a's sea power, in, the Far. East. ; 'It
wan President Roosevelt's compromise,
and Mr. de Witte knew its, contents as
Well as Baron Komura. -.The "question ; of
whether he had been "blufÃng" was put
to "the test.
Baron Komura in a few words v ex
plained that "Japan in her great desire for
peace was ready to make certain "modi
fications" of, the original* articles, injthe
hope that Russia could see it possiblo to
accept them. He then presented 'iii writ
ing: to Mr. "de Witte the compromise
propositioiT which President - Roosevelt
had suggested. ,

PORTSMOUTH. N. H.. Aug.. 23.â The
Japanese plenipotentiaries at the conclu
sion of the afternoon peace session to-day
threw the cards upon the table. It was
the dramatic momentâ the moment to
which all the previous proceedings of the
conference had led. .The protocols involv
ing agreement upon * eight; of the twelve
conditions originally - presented by Japan
had been elcned. One side or the other
must make a move or the plenipotentia
ries h.-id reached the parting of the ways.
The adversaries faced each other across
the table. Of course, it* was weir under
stood what. would occur, but that in a
way only made it more dramatic. . .
Figuratively, President' Roosevelt. Bud-,
denly entered the conference room; Mr.
de Witte eat silent, and the' move in the
great diplomatic game passed to Japan.

Following; the Kuuian rrjertloa of
the President *Â» rompromlsf proposition
in the peace conference yesterday, an
\u25a0 djwnrnment was taken until Saturday.
The present outlook is that the envoys
will then meet only to adjourn sine
die. Advice* 'from St. Petersburg in
dicate an unalterable determination
upon the part at the Cur, to withdraw
hfa plenlpotentlarlen unless Japan 1 un
equivocally recede from her demand for
indemnity. " Following the failure, of
the n< c.Â»Â«i:>tloiiÂ« yesterday, the RuMslan
envoys authorised a statement explain
ing their position. Although presumably
correcting the erroneous Ideas - of a'
portion of the American' press as to
the Russian ettlturie,' it contained a
veiled reflection upon: the President.
With lilÂ« compromise proposition as its
theme, the f tttatement declared that
Russian national honor, 'could . not be
purchaHed by . a subterf ugre, and that
the efforts of Russia's American friends
were misdirected *In the belief that
honor was held so lightly In St. Peters
fonrjr that It eonld be satisfied by " a
mere chance In the phraseology of the
Japanese demands.*

BOSTON. Aug. 23.â Dr. Washington
Gladden of Columbus. Ohio, moderator of
the National Council of the Congrega
tional Church, has sent to the officers
of the American Board of Commission*
ers ' for Foreign Missions, whose head
quarters is in this city. . a statement, of
principles issued by the . prudential com
mittee .' of the board . in relation to thÂ«
acceptance of so-called "tainted money,'*.
Dr. Gladden also forwarded. a resolution
on the acceptance of gifts by the. board,
which he intends to offer at I the annual
meeting of .the board in Seattle, Septem
ber 14 to, 13.
Dr. Gladden characterizes the state
ment 'of 'the prudential committee as be
ing, radically defective In three, partsâ
that It. does not recognize the. fact that
the board la simply an agent and repre
sentative of the Congregational churches;
that the . statement of care and responsi
bility for the resources from which dona
tions come is far too sweeping, and that
the real question of soliciting, funds from
doubtful, sources Is evaded. * -,-
Following Is the Gladden resolution: -
Resolved. That the officers of this society
should neither solicit nor Invite donations to Its
funds from persons whose gains are generally
believed to have been adopted by methods mor
ally reprehensible and socially . injurious.
When the Vice President had finished
speaking thousands of his audience press
ed forward to shake his hands. .
The . monument is a Roman column,
designated "The "\u25a0' Spirit of Liberty,"
standing forty feet high, surmounted by
a bronze . figure of liberty and Â» guarded

waived in .. the course of. the negotia.
t'.ons, is devoid of importance. The'dls
efzned \u25a0 ships . In question are Russia's
.Jr/ right and to ask that they be hand
ed over to Japan is to demand a breach
of the law of nations.
**But a' grievous, mistake was com
mltted^by those Who Imagined that the
plenipotentiaries of,-tjiÂ«- Czar, the rep
resentatives : -of the *: Russian-,- nation,
would take the husk for :tne~ kernel, the
\u25a0hade for the substance.* A parson of
average Intelligence can see that -what
la new In this proposal Is only the
phraseology in which It is couched.
"At first sight the offer may perhaps
term new to some, but a closer exam
ination will show It to be in all es
sentials identical with the proposal al
ready rejected by- Russia's representa
tives. Only a person unfamiliar with
war. In love with humanitarlanlsm.
foreign to Russia and Incompetent to
Judge of- Russia's national honor and
dignity, would decry in those terms the
source of ar new impulse given to the
peace negotiations.
PORTSMOUTH. N. H.. Aug. 23.â The
following authoritative statement ex
plains the Russian position with regard
to the latest stage of the negotiations:
"Statements have appeared in promi
nent American and English papers,
which, while eloquent, studiously mode
rate and well intentioned, are unhap
pily calculated to mislead the world as
to the prospects of peace and the gen
eral character of Japan's so-called new
proposal, ' with whicn. It is contended,
Russia can close without loss of dig
nity. The regrettable mistake into
which the representatives of these Jour
nals have undoubtedly fallen is obvi
ously the result of misleading data,
leavened with real but secondary facts.
Thus, it is quite true, as those papers
predicted, that the envoys of Japan
came forward at to-day's siting with a
proposal which was new in form, but
old in substance. It is equally true
that that' proposal lacks the two con
tentious clauses stipulating that Rus
sia shall surrender to Japan her dis
armed ships and limit her naval
strength on the Pacific, and that it re
duces the differences between the two
powers to the compass of what Is, in
appearance, a single question, the sale
of Saghalien. Seemingly,' therefore,
Japan has also struck her pen through
the most obnoxious clause of allâ that
which deals with indemnityâ and all
that she now asks Russia to do, in ad
dition to the terms already agreed
upon, is to purchase the northern half
of Saghalien for the sum of one mil
liard two hundred million yen (1,200,
000.000) and this alleged simplification
of terms Is supposed to provide Russia
with an acceptable basis for a peace
treaty. . '
SIMPLY A CHANGE OF WORDING.
Statement Authorized by the Pleni
potentiaries of the Cmar. ,' f /.
RUSSIA'S POSITION EXPLAINED.
his family says he expects to have fully
recovered from- the ;wounds. received in
the I battle of the Sea - of . Japan by the
end 'of September,, when, witn per
mission of the' : 'Japanese 'Government,
he' will start for Russia; ';, V ,' >
Russia Is ready, . however, to make a
reasonable and proper payment for the
maintenance of the Russian prisoners in
the hands of the Japanese.
This has been ' the attitude of the
Foreign Office since the four points in
dispute were referred to St. Petersburg
from Portsmouth." and it is the true ex
pression of Russian official ' and public
opinion. Since the very beginning' of the
discussion here on Japan's original terms
there has been absolutely nothing to sug r
gest that Russia could or would pay in
demnity. Each day . has sharpened the
conviction that such a payment Is im
possible, and to-day the â¢ general, opinion,
from the highest to the lowest, is that
Japan's insistence on an indemnity dooms
the- Portsmouth' "negotiations to; failure.
Russians recognize the serious , internal
conditions \u25a0of the country, but they de
clare these conditions will : never force
the payment of an indemnity, dishonor
able -in Itself and which would most
seriously menace the very ;llfe of .the
state. 'â¢' t ;Jt V ; '. : r ; â¢',
In view of the known Russian attitude
on the other eight points, Russia be
lieves that Japan's Insistence on indem
nity Is the only, thing that, will make
peace impossible. Officials declare that
attempts at word Juggling, such as
calling indemnity by some other name,
or attempting to collect indemnity, under
the guise of other payments, will avail
nothing. Russia, they say, will not . con
clude a peace treaty which includes the
payment of indemnity or other financial
contributions. .
Indemnity is the crux of the whole
matter. If this question can be ar
ranged, it is believed that all other ques
tions on which there has been a diver
gence of opinion will settle themselves:
ST. PETERSBURG, . Aug. 24.â Russia
will never â¢ consent to. the .payment '61
indemnity to Japan. "Such payment
would so gravely menace , the â¢vital"'in
terests of the state as to make this arti
cle in the Japanese peace terms utterly
lmopssible of acceptance.
If Japan would withdraw her indem
nity demand, peace practically would be
assured, as the Russian attitude on the
other points. Including the " cession of
Saghalien, does not preclude the possi
bility of reaching a satisfactory settle
ment.
Will Not' Pay Indemnity, no . Matter
How the Proportion .Be \Vorded.
RUSSIA'S DECISION IS FINAL.
PORTLAND, Aug.. 23.â That the plan of
holding the ;. deliberations of the National
Irrigation Congress in sections, -initiated
at the instance ' of "Secretary/ of Agricul
ture Wilson, lsa failure seems to be the
consensus of, opinion among theVdelegates
to the congress, which Is now in
in Portland, and In this view some of the
Government officials who have come here
to address the sections coincide. ;,;
Notwithstanding that there are in Port
land about 3200 accredited delegates -to
the convention, . not. more \ than fifty or
seventy-five all - attended | the sec
tional meetings 'either yesterday or to
day. The work of the congress is being
done by v - the resolutions and
the only interest that has,' been/ aroused
since the general session -.on, the \ opening
day was over the arguments which have
taken -place during its meetings. This
committee has been attended by about
fifty delegates, -and: the , one thousand
others are spending their, time in viewing
the fair or visiting different points of in
terest about the city. \u25a0 . /
Answering a question as to what he
thought of the plan; former Governor. L.
B. Prince of New Mexico crystallized the
sentiment which prevails *by saying
"Think about it; it requires no thought;
it speaks for itself; It is a failure."
Another \u25a0 prominent delegate said: "The
congresses at El Paso and Portland have
been both fizzles. But what can we do?
We cannot afford to antagonize the
wishes of. the Government, for without
its support we cannot exist, and if the
present arrangement continues I don't be
lieve we -will be able to exist much long
er with it." Vr^H
RESOLUTIONS ON STATEHOOD.
- Interesting papers were read in the dif
ferent sections before groups running
from five to twenty-five, but with such
sparse attendance it -,is hard for ' the
speakers to do themselves Justice, and
discussion is *t a minimum. 'â¢
The resolutions committee, . whose ses
sions have -been marked by much stormy
talk, hild. three . sessions . to-day. . Two
hours and. a half were consumed at the
morning session in acrimonious disputes
as to the merits of a resolution which
tended-to do away with confusion in the
minds of Eastern people, who .are, , it is
said, unaware that the National Irriga
tion Congress and | National . Irrigatiori As
sociation are entirely different/organiza
tions. Before the resolution" was adopted
the debate at times grew exceedingly
heated, and at one period', it resolved it
self into a personal attack upon some of
the officials of the j irrigation | association;
But few resolutions have, been adopted
in committee so .far, the principal ones
being the Indorsement of ; separate state
hood for Oklahoma, New, Mexico and
Arizona and one which declares that the
Government should not* lnterfere \u25a0> with, or
prevent private - enterprise^ from' /con
structing reservoirs for reclamation /pur
poses on the/Rla' Grande , River, in *New.
Mexico and the j Colorado above El .. Paso.

\u25a0 Assertions were made that large sums

After the committee had ; discussed the
subject for more than two hours. Boothe
was called to the committee-room to ex-~
plain what, if any, connection; there ex
isted between the two ( organizations. -/.
' Boothe S was undef the impression : that
a personal attack had been made upon
him, and from the outset resented /any
supposed insinuation. that ithere^ had been
any misrepresentation by ; him/ or % by; the
association; of which he was a: director.
Personalities were further /.injected" into
the discussion by the reading of an rt ar
ticle reproduced from the St. Louis, Globe,
Democrat, which, in the ; opinion of sev
eral of ,the delegates, left' the \u25a0impression
that Boothe .was allowing his 'name,; to
be connected/ with : the/ two organizations
in a manner that brought -inevitable con
fusion. If was stated Vby Bootheâ and -in
his statement; he ; was' substantiated by

Fails of Desired Results
The report Is industriously circulated
he-re that Emperor William is responsible
for the attitude of Emperor Nicholas, and
everything is traced back to the meeting
of the Emperors on board the Hohenzol
lc-rn |n the Finnish Gulf. In support of
this it is positively stated that, after the
interview. Mr. de Wltte's Instructions
were made stronger and more unyielding.
Mr. - Roosevelt himself to-night, may
knew more about how the Emperor feels
than Mr. de Witte and be able to act
upon the information conveyed to him
by his Embassador. \u0084v;v ; ." â¢
Private advices from St. Petersburg say
that sentiment there, in Moscow and In
large centers favors acceptance of the
compromise. This may mean much. But
the real hope still rests with President
Roosevelt. He is resourceful. He has
made another move. He has sent Embas
eador Meyer direct to the Emperor, and
they were together, according to advices
received here, for two hours to-day.
Black as the prospects appear to-night,
however, the failure of the negotiations
is not certain. The Russian camp is pes
simistic, to a man, but they ail know
the qulcuc and starring changes of tronj.
that some times take place at Peterhof.
And there are factors in the situation
which might affect one of those suaden
end inexplicable changes in the Emperor's
attitude which have frequently aston
ished Russia.
I'RESHJEXT MAKES XEW MOVE.
The long instruction received last even
ing, whilt not a rep.y to the communica
tion of President Roosevelt given to Mr.
de Wittc at the navy yard yesterday aft
ernoon, was of a character to almost com
pletely, destroy hope that it will be pos
sible for Mr. dc Witte to satisfy the Jap
anese demands. Mr. de Witte himself has
b<-en quoted ass aying that he would not.
If ordered to do co by the Emperor, sign
a treaty involving the payment of a
leapt cc
But it must be borne in mind that Mr.
de Witte, |n the negotiations, is not a free
agpnt. He represents his Emperor. If he
were absolutely fr'.e, this conference
would not fall. He would make peace. He
sympathizes with the solution offered by
the President, but his hands are tied,
and unless he receives an imperial com
mand he cannot move. .- -~\:-?
CZAR'S WORD TO DE WITTE.
Unless the Emperor agrees to yield
between now and Saturday the end is
likely to come on that day. And the
Indications from Peterhof, instead of
raising the chances, indicate even a
firmer determination to yield neither
territory nor indemnity, sugar-coated
though the latter may be.
And bo the plenipotentiaries sepa
rated, to meet again on Saturday, osten
sibly to permit Mr. de "VVitte to place
In writing, as the rules of the confer
ence require, his reply to the Japanese
compromise proposition. In reality the
adjournment over the two days was to
give each side an opportunity' to con
sult its Government for the last time.
The outlook is black. Many believe
It was never so black as to-night. The
Japanese are" not talking. Indeed, to
night they appear to be more taciturn
and more resolute than ever. The only
possible line of further Japanese con
cession is considered to lie in the
diminution of the amount of the pur
chase money demanded for the n^orth
half of Saghalien. The decision rests,
therefore, as it has from the first, with
Russia. . ;.* %..

' "Russia has suffered reverses, owing to
her own lack of organization, her un
preparedness and her internal disorders,
but she is still a mighty and uncon
quered nation, whose people will en
thusiastically uphold their representa
tives in the firm resolve to keep the na
tional escutcheon Immaculate. Whatever
else may be affirmed -or denied of- them,
that is true. They alone are the judges
of what can and cannot be done In Rus
sia's name. If, therefore, the efforts of
American friends are to be crowned with
success, if the labors of the conference
are not to end in smoke,, and if the
effusion of blood In the Far East is
to be terminated, it behooves Japan to
make a frank. declaration that she with

"Therefore, despite the positive and

"Japan, having obtained all that she
needed and longed for as a nation, now
narrows down the issue to a question
of dollars and cents, yet refuses for
peace's sake to waive her demands.
Russia, on the contrary, has conceded
freely and fully everything she couiC

BERLIN, Aug. 23.â The agitation for
the opening of .the frontiers- to the freÂ«
importation of meat and live animals has
taken the form of telegraphic appeals,
by associations 4 and municipalities, to.
Chancellor yon Bulow. especially from
Thuringia. where prices are alleged to
be 40 per cent higher than formerly.
There seems no doubt that the price
of meat has risen 40 per cent during the
last ten years and from 20 to 30 per
cent within a year, but those who. are
investigating the situation .are divided
as to the causes^ â whether the increase*
are attributable partly to the generally,
Increasing scale of living, not alto
gether to the customs duties and the
sanitary barrier to the Importation ot
meats and live animals.

been able to reach a point of agreement.
The High School Board has taken meas

end the controversy and secure for thÂ«
city a suitable site and permit the con

out further delay.
Since no other available site has been
offered the High School Board has de
cided to call an election of the voters In
the school district. to vote upon the ques

Is admirable for such a purpose, and it is

The vessels were forgotten until sev
eral years ago, when unusually low
water In the Thames revealed one of
them. A Dlan was originated to have
them recovered, brought to Detroit and
presented to the city as memorials. No
action was taken, however, until sev
eral days ago, when a Detroit explor
ing 1 party, headed by C. M. Burton and
Charles L. Clark, quietly began opera
tions. So far the work of the explorers
and their divers has resulted In the
definite location of three vessels at
points one and a half, two and six
miles upstream from Chatham. The
vessels are partly or wholly covered
with sand and earth. In the one most
exposed the hull was found to con
tain boxes and barrels of cannon balls
and other stores. Further search is
expected to reveal chests of silver,
which records in possession of the ex
plorers show were taken upon the
boats.
After the crushing defeat inflicted
by Perry the shattered remnant of the
British fleet slipped Into Detroit and
was hastily pressed into service by
General Proctor, who realized that
safety lay only in flight. Four vessels
were hastily loaded with arms, ammu
nition, stores, Government papers and
other plunder from Detroit and all
speed made to Lake St. Clair. The lit
tle fleet took refuge on the Thames,
and in the battle which followed the
ships were sunk. Tecumseh, the great
Indian chief, who assisted the British,
lost his life,, and Proctor, escaping, la
ter committed suicide. â¢
DETROIT, Mich., Aug. 23.â Agitation
by several Dominion newspapers
threatens to precipitate an Interna
tional controversy over the proposed
raising and removal to Detroit of three
British war vessels which were sunk in
the river Thames in the famous land
and naval battle of October 5, lgl3.
The remains of these once stanch
war vessels' are those of a part of the
British fleet that attempted to resist
Commodore Perry at Put- In Bay. At
that time "the * whole " northwestern
country, through the surrender of De- j
trolt by Hull, had fallen Into British
hands. I
I SEATTLE, Aug. 23.â Wholesale graft
ing in several of the departments of the
Puget Sound navy yard is, on good au
thority, said to be tne charge contained
in 'a report sent to Washington by Spe
cial Agent R. P. Pickerell of the Navy
Department, who for ..lie last two months
has been here investigating. The report
was mailed on Saturday night, and prom
ises to rival the postomge and land
fraud scandals. Against whom the
charges are made it is impossible to as
certain. , Report at the navy yard has
it that when Captain Burwell, the new
commandant, arrives to relieve Admiral
Barclay,' there will be a big shake-up.
Pickerell,, it is said, has backed up his
charges with affidavits, and they, impli
cate many of the department foremen,
if not . higher officials. Among ' the
charges , declared to be included > are the
following: That certain employes of the
yard have been j smuggling Government
supplies into the yard, and that one of
the Government launches for months has
been used to carry the goods and ma
terial from Bremerton to "fences,", who
disposed of them; that employes are com
pelled to live at certain boarding-houses
at exorbitant rates and dare not move
for fear of being laid off;. employment of
alien labor at the yard; that a number
of fugitives from Justice from other
States are employed In the yard.
A month ago a grip belonging to "Agent
Pickerell containing affidavits of an In
criminating nature was stolen from his
hotel room. It is' believed he was shad
owed and the grip taken by some one
interested In the investigation. A part
of the; stolen affidavits have been dupli
cated.'

When the hearing of San Francisco had

they were entitled to the 25 per cent re
duction asked for, and he moved that
the application be denied. Alford second

Assessor Benjamin Ward of Los An
geles County said the reports In the pa
pers yesterday would give the impression
that realty values In Los Angeles are on
a precarious footing. He 1 said the news
paper reports were Justified to an extent
by the statements, made -before, the board
yesterday. However, the only slump in
values' in and about Los Angeles had ap
peared at Redondo Beach. The people
went wild over the prospects and values
increased by daily jumps, which were
not warranted by actual 'conditions. Ex
cept for this. Ward said, realty values in
and about Los Angeles are on a safe and
sane basis.
Dodge said, in answer to a question by
Chairman Brown, that the Assessors in
the State are the poorest paid of all offi
cials. For himself. Dodge said he had no
complaint to make, for his salary had
been doubled. Even at this, he said,
many of his deputies were merely mes
sengers. They are sent out to make as
sessments, but have to -take the sworn
statements of owners as to the value of
properties. Dodge said the sooner the
people of the various counties of \ the
State awake to the fact that it is real
economy to provide the Assessors with
-P^ufflcient help the sooner will their coun
ty returns on taxations be increased.

ings over $5,000,000. This gave the erron
eous impression that the $15,000,000 of new.
Improvements had been assessed for only
$2,000,000.
He made the statement that it cost 20
to 40 per cent more to construct buildings
in San Francisco than It does to construct
them in Los Angeles, owing principally
to the difference of the wage scale be
tween the two cities. Dodge also said the
advance of structural steel, iron and oth
*cr building materials had increased the
coast of building in San Francisco.
Chairman Brown asked Rich if he
handled Los Angeles properties, and the
latter replied in the negative. Brown
suggested tbat Los Angeles' growth was
too rapid for him, but Rich said it was
too slow for him to bother with, this
declaration causing a hearty laugh at
the expense of the Los Angeles delega
tion.
only $2,000,000. Dr. Dodge said that he
had explained to the board that this
$15,000,000 Improvements hnd been. assessed
at a valuation of $7,500,000, or 50 per cent
of its value. However, there had been
written off for deterioriation on old build-
years of $30,000,000. Howell said buildings
had deterioriated In value, but in the
case of many of them no reduction in
assessment had been made in thirty
years. . He cited a case of a building
which was assessed at $150,000 being given
away to a contractor to remove it from
the land.

Assessor Dodge interposed to say that
in nearly every instance of this character
he assessed the land so high that the
lo&3 on assessment on the buildings was
more than made up. He said the press
.of the State had given publicity to the
A.-tatement that $15,000,000 of improvements
.in San Francisco had been assessed for
President Howell opened for San Fran
cisco's representatives, stating that
Dodge's assessment was fair, to say the
least, inasmuch as he had Increased
the assessment generally 16^ per cent

that properties outside of San Francisco
ure assessed at a lower percentage of
selling- value- ' *
In answer to a question by Equalizer

of their value at least. Mattison replied
that if such be the case. San Francisco

The Board of Supervisors of Los An
geles County yesterday asked the State
Board of Equalization for a reduction of
> $10,000,000 in the assessments levied by-
Assessor Benjamin Ward, It developed
at the hearing that the Los Angeles
County Board of Equalization had thrown
out assessments on* quasi-public corpora
tions amounting to J10.000.000, and that
the average of assessment in that county
ran only to 35 per cent of the selling
vaiue of the property, while in San Fran
cisco It is nearer 65 per cent. To-day, on
motion of Equalizer R. H. Beamer, the
request of Los Angeles County was de
nied, and Alford's motion looking to a
raise of the Los Angeles assessment fol
lowed.
HOW-ELL BEFORE BOARD.
Representatives of the Sail Francisco
Real Estate Board appeared before the
State Board of Equalization to-day in
reference to that city and county's as
sessment. No application on the part
of San Francisco for a reduction in as
sessment has been made, but the mem
bers of the Real Estate Board were de
sirous of showing that Assessor Wash
ington Dodge had assessed properties
fairly.
Dr. Washington Dodge of Ban Fran
cisco was in attendance, as were his
deputies. W. B. Prichard and M. W.
Pratt. President J. R. Howell of the
San Francisco Real Estate Board and
Directors E. L. Hoag and David Rich
were also present. The Los Angeles
delegation, which appeared yesterday,
was also in attendance.
SACRAMENTO. Aug. 23,-The State
Board of Equalization to-day refused to
comply with the request of the officials
of Los Angeles County that its assess
ment be reduced 25 per cent. Following
this a motion was made by Equalizer
William H. Alford to cite Los Angeles
County to appear to enow why Its as
sessment should not be raised. The mo
tion came as a climax to the rather acri
monious discussion of yesterday between
representatives of Los Angeles and San
Francisco relative to the comparative val
uations placed on real estate in the two
citleE. At the request of Chairman Alex

drawn, with the understanding that It
would be renewed to-morrow.

Taking up the efficiency report, the wit
ness said that he was j not actuated by
malice toward Taggart when he omitted
the record of Taggart's meritorious ser
vice during the Kansas City flood and in
serted demerits which ; should not have
gone into the report. '
Captain D. W. Ryther then took the
stand and testified that, at Fort Thomas,
he was well acquainted with Captain and
Mrs. Taggart and frequently, at their
invitation, called at their, house. In re
gard to his midnight visit. to Mrs. Tag
gart, as described by ; Howard Taggart,
he said that Mrs. Taggart sent him after
some I medicine . for one of her children,
and on his return with it -no met Howard
in the hallway. . He also told of . having
escorted Mrs. Taggart and the children
to the depot at Fort Leavenworth when
they left for San Francisco. : *
Charles Heffelflnger, a ; bartender in
Koch's saloon, . testified that Mrs. Tag
gart and her two boys ate, at the restau
rant over the saloon. He asserted that he
never sold beer to Mrs. Taggart, nor to
Perry Rope, as young Rope had asserted.
"At the meeting In your office, general,
what did Taggart say about his wife con
sorting with Fortescue?" \u25a0:\u25a0 â¢
"He said nothing: to me." '. ; ,
','Didn't. you agree; with Mrs. Taggart
to keep the captain imprisoned until she
could take the children and leave ' the
country?"
"I had an agreement with her, but not
exactly like that.:/ -
Attorney Sterling then took up a certi
fied copy of the charges made by Cap
tain Taggart against General Miner now
on file in the War Department. The
charges were read, ' ' to the effect ; that â¢at
a dinner party at Fort Leavenworth Gen
eral Miner demeaned himself with con
duct unbecoming an officer and a gentle
man by taking improper liberties with
Mrs. Taggart. . . ;
On redirect examination Miner, said that
he did not make out the muster roll of
Captain Taggart' s company, and was not
responsible for the record it contained of
Taggart's sickness at; the time he was
confined in the , hospital. Ttie roll was
signed by Taggart, which would make* It
appear that he had made out his own
record.
"Because .ho "wa.ltod "-nntil all the wit
nesses, were out of the country," said the
general. >
"Why?" was asked.
; WOOSTER, Ohio. Aug. 23.â General C.
W. Miner, U. S. A. (retired),' .was Ton the
witness- stand the greater part of 'to
day in the Taggart divorce hearing. Back
and forth, between the two sides, Miner
went for cross-examination and re-exam
ination, sometimes makings admissions
but generally standing firm. When he
left the stand both sides thought, they
had gained points: strengthening their ev
idence already produced.
Sterling sharply- questioned Miner in
regard to whether his first belief in Cap
tain Taggart's insanity did nofcome
after he found that Taggart had named
him as co-respondent. Miner said that
while, he thought that Taggart was not
of sound mind all along he was sure he
wasn't when he read the amended pe
tition. \u25a0 .'-*'< â¢"\u25a0-.--

The Ryeshitelni made a number of

row escapes from the vigilant enemy and
at last gave up the perilous work and
was Interned at Chefu. While she
was at Chefu, unarmed, she was
boarded by Commander Terashima of the
Japanese navy and a body of little brown
bluejackets. Terashima hauled down the
Russian flag and hoisted the ensign of
tjie Island kingdom. Unarmed as they
were, the Russian officers and men threw
themselves OH ths Japanese and a terrific
fight ensued. The Russians fought with
fists. feet' and belaying pins, but finally
were compelled to surrender to their
armed foes. During the scrimmage Lieu
tenant Petrow received a serious wound
In the breast. He was made a prisoner
and is now at liberty on parole.

Kentwell expected to be held up by the
Chinese bureau officials here, and from
that detention to provide himself with an
illustration for the arguments with which
lie hopes to impress Senators and Con
gressmen In Washington, whither he Is
ffolcg to join the Chinese antl-excluslon
lobby. He had prepared h:mself, at an
expense of $10, he says, with all the pa
pers required by the exclusion act for
Chinese coming Into the United States.
One df the Afong girls, whose husband is
an officer of the United States army, was
enee held up -here, and Kentwell hoped
to be treated in like manner.
He walked the decks of the China, wait
ing anxiously for some Chinese bureau
official to treat him with discourtesy. He
wanted to be Insulted. He would have
welcomed an assignment for the night
to the meanest bunk in the detention
ched, and would have greeted as brother
the Government official who asked him
personal and humiliating questions. He
went as far as to ask people to call the
attention of the Chinese bureau officials
to the factTthat he, L. K. Kentwell, was
newly as much a Chinese as Ah Sing in
the steerage.
Kentwell was sorely disappointed when
he was. anowe4''to walk ashore without
even meeting the Chinese bureau officials.
He was treated exactly the came as any
other'cabin passenger and heÂ» will go to
Washington minus what was to have
been his strongest argument.
CODTG TO ST. PETERSBURG.
EXPECTS TO BE HELD UP.
Keatwell is only part Chinese, but. un
der the exclusion act, might just as well
be a slant-eyed, pig-tailtd Mongolian, as
lar as that barrier applies, for it in
cludes every person with Chinese blood in
his or her veins.
. Kentwell thinkg the Honolulu Chinese
bad quite a little to do with suggesting
the boycott as a means of securing a
taore liberal treaty between China and
the United States. Many of them are,
like MmselX. only part Chinese. They con
sider themselves Americans, and object
tc being treated as if they were not.
If China Is not exactly awake there is
little Coubt tha.t she Is getting decidedly
restless. In addition to the boycott she
Is gradually acquiring In 'Washington a
lobby cornposfc4 of the brightest and most
diplomatic of her people. With some
toember of this lobby every member . of
Congress will have made the acquaint
ance before the new cession is very old,

and hardiest of the tropical species), and,
moreover, with a climate in many places al

great American disease, yellow fever, why
there has not been a similar reciprocity; why
this disease has not managed to get it*Â«lf es
tablished la the Eastern HemUphero. That it
is capable of euccewful exportation has bÂ«cn
proved over and over again by epidemics,
great and small, which from time to time
have broken out In Europe, . more especially In
Spain and Italy. Nevertheless, yellow fever
has net succeeded in establishing itself per
manently in that part of the world: Why?
AS TO YELLOW FEVER.
Sir Patrick Manson, who has Just de
livered a course of Lane medical . lec
tures In this city, has- taken a ; great
deal of Interest in the problem of pro
tecting: San Francisco .and .Asia
from th<Â» introduction of tropical
diseases that may corae, .. from
the various countries- that are ..Jn
close commercial relation to it. Sir Pat
rick Is a director of the School of Tropi
cal Medicine In. London and is adviser
of the British Government on all ques
tions relating to the sanitary ' condition
of the colonies. Furthermore, he is the
discoverer of the fact that a certain class
of mosquito carries disease and helps to
spread epidemics. He. therefore, speaks
with the highjest authority in urging the
necessity of making here a. close study
of tropical diseases. He fears the dan
gper of yejllow fever being carried to
Asia when the Panama canal is com
pleted Is very great- . .
In discussing the question for The Call,
he said: ... . â ..
One of the most Important factors in. the
diffusion of disease Is the intercommunication
of peoples, whether this be by trade, by travel,
by pilgrimages, by wars cr otherwise. So long
as a community remains Isolated and cut oft
from the rest of the world, so long 1Â» it spared
many of the diseases of the rest of mankind.
Once a community begins to rise In impor
tance or be united In any way with the rest
of the world, pathological as well aa political
trouble begins. There are various kinds of
isolation. Geographical isolation, as by a
broad sea or lofty mountain range, for ex
ample. In primitive times there was nothing
more effective; but when -men began to navi
gate the seas, and to make roads over or
through the hllle, the protection . afforded by
tbesÂ« natural barriers was broken down, and
diseases hitherto localized became diffused and
almost general. Thus cholera and smallpox,
and doubtless many. other deadly diseases of
thÂ« old worid were carried, to the new and
to a less extent tha diseases of the new world
were carried to the old.
I believe that a scrupulously administered
quarantine on the Panama canal, a quarantlna
which need not be Irksome to human belnKV
but which would be absolutely fatal to stegom
yla, would effectually protect A6la against yel
low fever. The United Btatea must carry this
out. It Is one of the responsibilities of which.
In my openinjr lecture, I epoke that your ex
panding- influence has brought on you. It Is
not the lea-st or the least Important,
These and other sanitary and medical prob
lems that the construction of the Panama ca
nal will bringr up are \u25a0 likely to make that
great undertaking: historical in . the develop
ment of tropical medicine. -As an engineering
work the undertaking Is colossal, but io fat
as I know It- involves In this reepect no new
oi- Important principle; its Buccewful accom
plishment, po f ar as a piece of canal-making
goes. Is simply Â» question of money, a mere
application of well-known methods and appli
ance*. But from tha sanitary point of view it
It ctherwiEe. No such gigantic work has been
carried through in a sfonllar climate. No Â»uch
opportunity for the application of the new
discoveries In tropical pathology has arisen.
; From this standpoint â¢' its progreea will bÂ«
watched with intense, lnterest by. all students
of tropical medicine. Great Britain hts slowly
learned by long' and life-bought experience
how. In her tropical possessions and -depend
encies, to protect, in. a measnre, the health of
her- administrators and soldiers, her \u25a0 mission
aries her engineers and. her merchants. This
she did long before "much was kndwti about
the etiology of tropical disease; even before its
cardinal principles were apprehended. . . Her
methods were the outcome .of experience, hard
ly of science. The makers of the Panama
canal have a greet pull'in tMs respect T over
the old country: for not Qnly are you the. wel
come heirs to all . this hardiwon experience,
but you are to-day In a'- position never, until
recently, enjoyed by ' Great Britain." About to
enter on this undertaking, you are In full pos
session of that great outstanding cntloloKical
factâ that most tropical disease Is Insect
borne. I Sincerely hope the authorities appre
ciate this. It -Is the crux. of, the; situation. It
means treasure! It means'more than thisâ lt
means thousands ofitnifriani lives. And-ywhen
,you have -made ;,th.is,-caOTi,~ nay. /before and
i wnlle- making- it, remember- Asia. â¢" Do not be
so un-Christian as to reciprocate her gift to
you of cholera, by a return gift In the shape of
yellow fever. ; ' â¢* , : ~
CANAL A DANGER POINT.
We can, with Justification, anticipate such a
calamity. Can it be prevented? The failure of
France to carry through the -Panama canal
scheme, and the ' opportune discovery of | the
part plÂ«yÂ«d by the stegomyia mosquito In the
diffusion of yellow fever, before America took
over the task, look HUt cont lated anfl provi
dential occurrences. ..â¢\u25a0 . â ' â¢-
This setins to me to be no idle speculation,
but a big, ugly > fact looming in the -near fu
ture. It is difficult to. imasrlne the. extent of
the calamity to Asiatic mankind that would
follow the succeisful Introduction of an in
fected stegomyla mosquito into mich huge dis
tributing -centers as Hongkong or ' Singapore.
You. In America know full well what havoc
yellow fever wrought In some \u0084 of your own
cities, and that, \u25a0 too, in defiance of all . the ap
pliances of civilization- and of the ! co-opera
tion of an educated population. . What would
happen on thÂ« Introduction of. this disease into
a thoroughly non-immune; uneducated unsan
itary, superstitious and overcrowded Eastern
city, into such a place as Canton, or into any
of the great centers of population in tropical
Asia* The Immediate calamity would be ter
rible, but, worse than this,, the East would be
permanently contaminated. â¢ '
germ, whether in man or mosquito, that may
have started from the West 'Indies, Rio de Ja
neiro or Panama, has'not succeeded in surviv
ing the. long Journey." We are now approach
ing a point In the history -of * ocean travel and
commerce when all this will be changed. Iâ¢'â¢1 â¢'â¢ In a
very few years the Panama canal will be an
accomplished facÂ£.'. \u25a0 A ; continual procession of
ships will, alter* traversing, the yellow, fever
area, stream from Panama, and, \u25a0 rapidly pass
ing through the warm - Pacific seas, â¢ carry
freight and passengers; to all parts of what
is now (as regards the .West Indies, the' Gulf
of Mexico and the Caribbean \u25a0- Sea) the Far
East, but which then will be the near West.
Years ago the slow " sailing shin managed to
carry yellow fever many times to Europe;
â¢well, then, may the fast traveling steamer of
our day carry yellow . fever: to Asia.. . If . step
ping EtoneÃ are heeded' there are Honolulu and
the Philippines. \u25a0: "* "" ::*

-A freshly Infected spot in St. Bernard
parish was announced to-day. It -. is
at Terreauxboeufs, the .. pariah, seat.
Health Officer Meraux found five genu

picious. The town and Its vicinity
were invaded by Italians after the
fever appeared here and . the Infection
is attributable to New Orleans. . -;
NEW ORLEANS. Aug. 23.âSum
mary of the yellow fever situation up
to 6 o'clock this evening: New cases,
64; total to date, 1536; deaths. 5; total
deaths. 219; new foci. 10; total, 352;
"under treatment. 322. , \u0084
One Ot the features of the situation
that is attracting attention Is what are
termed new foci. ln excess of the num
ber of cases under treatment. , It is an
encouraging feature, because :it la an
indication of a slow extension of the
fever, which is particularly true of the
district above Canal street. In order
to take no chances the authorities are
not to cancel new foci until after thirty
days have elapsed. v \ - \u25a0
Large auantltles of rock salt have
been ' purchased by the Federal- au
thorities, with a view to salting stag
nant gutters and pools. Imperfect
drainage exists in many of the wards,
due to the - fact that the - drainage sys
tem has not yet been entirely com
pleted. The salt is expected to" de
stroy the pools as breeding places for
mosquitoes.
- Some of the soldiers stationed. at the
United States barracks are restless un
der their enforced Quarantine. â¢ Com
munication with the city has been ab
solutely prevented and the appearance
of fever In St. Bernard makes it prob
able that no communication with that
parish will be allowed. The officers in
command are, however, exerting them
selves to make the detention \u25a0of . tbe
men less Irksome. Not a case of fever
has appeared in- the barracks and the
soldiers are considered to be absolutely
in no danger. , .' . ,

'â¢ The. American' church does; not -seem, to be
much more than a social organization now. Its
members spend .. more I time developing . along
social lines than they do along spiritual -lines.
The business men are Xhe Influential Christians
and others do not do their duty. Wrapped up
In their own affaire or busy in the. pursuit. of
frivolity, they lose track of the way and forget
the pledge they made 'to' their church organi
zation. The old fire and old-time â¢' spirit : are
lacking, ' without which what can be expected
but social clubs and a leading away from God
and the sath? - â¢ â¢ . ; ,' '
What the churches want â¢ Is more- .God and
less ot dress and social position,' more spirit
of the Master and less of strife for place -and

The gratitude of the convention 'toward

After this address the reports of the
various departments of missionary work
were read. The saving of children while
they are young Is the keynote of the pol
icy of thÂ« Christian church.*' and the re
ports of the work done. shows that It has
accomplished much along that line. It has
established six orphanages for children
and a few homes for old people who are
helpless. It has taken care of 6000 chil
dren by placing them in good private
homes with Christian families. The plans
"for the future are bright. Promises of
support come from many directions. In
the last ten months the cash received
amounted to $60,638, with real estate val
ued at SSOOO In addition. .
A motion was made appointing a com
-xnlttee of three . to consider the
founding of an orphanage for homeless -
children In this State. Rev. A. C. Me-
Keever of Los ' Angeles heads this com
mittee. It seems highly 'probable that
the building of this home will be accom
plished.
At the morning service Dr. E. Ik Powell

G a ATEFUL : TO PASTOR ...WHITE.
MJLM' HOMES ESTABLISHED.
The â¢ aÂ»ronaut tells us that far above the
ring-ing- of belli and the whistle or engines
caji be heard the cry of children. May it be
that above the din and strife of this busy age
the dftciples of him who said, "Suffer little
children and forbid them not to come onto
me," may hear the voice of childhood; sty*
the children their rights and sin against (hem
no more fore\'er.
"God will put you In the fire," has said many
a mother to an unruly child, and In spite of
ell after-training, even the mas thinks of a
God of vemrence ana hatred.
"Hush up. or I'll lock you In the closet with
thÂ« bad man." has quieted many a cry. but at
what a price! You sinned against -the child
for the good man was In the closet instead.
Another time you wonder why the child Is so
afraid In tl*e dark. I do not - say he should
not be corrected, but that he has a right to the
truth. . - .
Every child has a right to- thÂ«' truth. : He
by nature accepts everything- as true and 'no
parent, teacher, : preacher or superintendent
has a right to disturb the confidence of. these
connaing little people. "Where Is the canary?"
inquired a mother. "I let thÂ« cat get him,"
said the five-year-old. \u25a0 "Why* son, what did
you do that for?" "Because/ 1 said the boy,
"you said If I told stories the bird would tell
on me. but he'll never tell on me now."
HAS RIGHT TO MOBAI \ATCRE
Everr child has a rirht to the largest pos
eible development cf the moral nature that at
every step on the highway of life he-may know
and rejoice in his duty to God' and his fel-
Jow men. \u25a0 ' - ..,...:._
Every child has a right to the largest pos
sible intellectual development. that parents and
the State can give. Ignorant people are neither
hippy nor useful. If we would serve our gen
eration'we mnst so train the- young that' they
cxay be both. - . .. ' â¢ .... .
Every child hae a right to sit at soirÂ«! one's
table of wholesome food when he 1* hungry,
to warm at some one's fireside when he 'is
cold, to sleep In some one's comfortable bed
when be is weary with toil and play. He
came into tfce world not of his choice and
until he is able to care for himself, some one
must provide for him the necessities of life.
Every child has a right to the development
of his physical body that by honest toll he
tray cÂ«re for any family God may give to him
and that he may have, 'to give to him that
needeth." The time -must come when there
*hatl be places besides penitentiaries and re
form schools, within easy reach of. all the
young where they shall -be taught from a
scientific standpoint, concerning the vocations
they are to follow. When -this matter receives
deserved attention, very few men and women,
boys and eiris wil! be found In State Institu
tions *at correction. "Do not sin against the
chi'.d." â¢ *...'
Thousands of children to-day - ere being
sinned against In that th*y are not receiving
their right* from those who brought them Into
th* world and from the church of Jesus Christ.
The feature of the afternoon session
yesterday was the address of Rev. Wil
liam A. Moore, a pastor of the Christian
church of Tacoma. "The. Rights of the
Child" was the subject of. his address
and in it he begged the elder members
of society not to sin against the little
ones. Part of his address is as follows:
The missionary convention just closed
has been a remarkable 'one In every way.
First, there gathered fully 7000 delegates
in San Francisco, many of them from
Eastern States. Although they came
on special trains running under new
echedules and stopped at many strange
places, there was not a single accident
to mar the enjoyment of the thousands,
and sickness was unknown. The spirit
of the convention was that of intense
religious zeal, Us culmination in the
pledging of ?100,000 to be raised for mis
sionary purposes entirely separate from
the regular contributions. The most able
speakers of the church were present to
mold the thoughts and feelings of the
crowd into poetic oratory. The weather,
after all a potent factor in the suc
cess of any gathering, was delight
fully pleasant from*, the beginning of the
first day to the end. The convention
adjourned to meet in Buffalo next year.
It was pleased with its work; it was
delighted with the hospitality of San
Francisco.
SPEAKS OF THE CHILD.
A simple devotional service at the Con
gregational Church last night marked
the close of the great International mis
sionary convention of t\e Christian
churches. During the day many eloquent
addresses were delivered, and there was
bustle and noise, but. at this linal ser
vice the words were few and - low, the
handshakes hearty and the' singing
t howed deep emotion and religious
zeal. The spirit of God was with these
thousands of delegates,- each one realiz
ing: that he liad attended an inspired con
vention, the lessons of which \vould
linger with him through many years.
Good-byes were hastily said and the
delegates hurried away to prepare their
departure from San Francisco, where
they have stopped for six days. This
morning they are leaving on every train,
6ome direct to distant homes, but most
of them for a tour of Southern California
before the return. Special excursions for
the accommodation of these delegates are
running everywhere. The largest Is a
special for Los Angeles, including a tour
of the many Interesting bits of California
along the way.

BERKELEY, AUg. ZÂ£.â Dr. J. ; Frederick
Wolle Is to have the professorship of
music at the State University. Corre
spondence between the university author
ities and Dr. Wolle has culminated in
the acceptance by him oÂ£ the offer made.
Other famous musicians, including Wal
ter Damrosch, were offered the position.
Damrosch found it impossible to accept,
because of contracts into which he had en
tered earlier in the year.
Dr. Wolle will arrive in Berkeley early
In September and begin work "^at once.
The university authorities made the fol
lowing statement to-day regarding Us ap
pointment: \u25a0 \u0084 .. ,' .-.
Dr Wolle comes from Bethlehem, Pa.,' where
he has been director of the Bach festivals, the
success At. which has given him a national,- and
even International, reputation, as a. chorus lead
er and organist. He comes from a: Moravian
family and finished his musical education un
der Prcfessor Rhejnberger,- in Munich. - , ' .. '
In 1900.. the nrst Bach; f festival was given
under his direction- There wÂ«Ve two sessions
given In one day. consisting of the B minor
mwi. This was the first time that that great
work was given in America. The festivals
given since then have added <yen more to his
prestige. \u25a0 Mr. Wolle, , who was the - moving
spirit of thete' remarkable festivals, is a son
of the Lehlgh Valley, and though he completed
his musical â¢ edneation abroad, he laid the
foundation of It here upon the Bach chorale
and tho Moravian hymn. He Is recognized as a
man ot solid scholarship, with full technical
knowledge, and great skill k^s-.a leader.. He
trace* his ancestry back to the early days of
the settlement, and comes from a long line of
musicians who tor generations contributed their
share toward making this community co musi
cal that the material for such an achievement
lay reac?y at hand: only waiting the advent of
a man who could by his attainments and per-
Eonallty bo fuse the various elenrcnts together
as to make possible such a series of perform
ances of the â¢ greatest , works in ! the field* of
sacral muelc as have been rarely heard In this
country. Â»t at all, and which from every point
of view may be considered In their effect on
the future of choral music in America as in
the truest nensÂ« epoch making. -.
The estÂ»Â«.blishrjent of the tnalr of music In
the tnlversity ot California should exert an
important Influence In the mu*leal interests of
th* whole State. With the Greek Theater the
posribi'lty for the development of. ajnagnt

prove a well-paying investment.
.""When you consider that the new lino
is to penetrate one of the most fertile
portions of Central California," remark
ed, he. "and will naturally lead to in
creasing the population of a new coast
section. It Is easy to imagine the great
benefit the road will be to San Francis
co. Although the construction- ot th9 w
line - presents no , great engineering"
problems, It will nevertheless be "a diffi
cult one to build, but the local capital
ists behind the project intend to. spare *
no money to make it an up-to-date
means of traffic. A very sensible move
was made when the promoters decided
to ; double- track their road, which in

"I hate to think that my. wife has de

show -she does not intend to return. It

suspicious of this man. Case, who dropped
out of sight soon after my wife left. I
shall not rest until I". have solved this
matter." It is a hard, situation, but as it
stands now we shall all have .to make
the best. of it and try to find.the girl at
all hazards. If she has run away, with
this man reconciliation will be hard. If
she hap only gone In a fit of sudden an
ger, as we at first suspected, her -home
coming will straighten out the trouble."
Descriptions of Ihe young woman, who
is only 19 years old, have been furnished
the police. She is five feet one inch tall,
weighs 120 pounds. Is stocklly built and
of dark complexion. She wore a white
waist, black skirt and white linen hat.
With the twins, which the young moth
er has left bo strangely, to care for, the
glrl"s parents are well, nigh distracted
over their daughter's unexplained lapse.
The husband and father Is eQually dis
turbed. For forty-eight hours he has
searched high and low for a trace of his
abeent wife or for some clew to the
whereabouts of Case, the man whom he
strongly suspects of luring the suscepti
ble girl-wife away from home and babies.
Cavalli and a brother of his wife visited
many of the labor headquarters where
artisans do mostly congregate in Oakland
and in San Francisco, hoping to run
across Case. They thought he might be
looking for work at his trade of lather.
But the hunt was bootless.
Concerning the disappearance Cavalli
said: . .

authorities of Haywards has failed to
disclose the whereabouts of Mrs. Emilia
Cavalli, the young wife of L. J. Cavalli,

"Many littles make- a much": and if
you find one w:int ad. a day worth an
swering the total of. gain at the. end of
a year will surprise you.
In accordance with the observation
of Byron,
"Talk six times with the same single
lady
And you may get the wedding dresses
ready,"
the tea table gossips have long since
linked the names of Miss Ednah P.
Robinson and Charles Sedgwick Alken
and shaken their heads prophetically,
but â but there was that old platonfc
friendship etory to throw them off. the
track. And now, imagine the tabbies"
chagrin when the man and the maid have
"fessed vp â that they are going to wed
â and to wed to-day. And not a gos
sip let Into the secret! â not until it
leaked out through the crevices of the
license oiuce. *
Now, every one knowing the man or
the maid accredits each with unbounded
cleverness, but who would have thought
themâ or any mere human creatureâclev
er enough to delude a whole city full of
friends, Sequoians. Bohemians, Spinners,
artists, journalists and hosts of other
friends unclassified?
The truth is out.
To-day, soon after the noon hour, at
Trinity Church, the Rev. Mr. Hulme will
Join the well-known editor, journalist.
Bohemian and all-round good fellow to
one of the cleverest young women of the
West â a union so eminently fit as to call
forth expressions of . Joy from every
friend who fell upon the sweet secret last
night. |
Returning, they will set up their house
hold gods at 825 Chestnut street, where
they will be at home after November 1.
After the wedding ceremony a break
fact will be served in the red room'at the
Bohemian Club, to which a very \ few
friends have been asked, after which the
editor and his bride will leave town for
two weeks.
That the betrothal was withheld and
the nuptial ceremonies will be of the
quietest nature is due to the continued
illness of Miss Robinson's mother. . j
In the Bohemian Club his sudden defec
tion from the bachelors' assemblage will
be received with the shock of a cold
shower, a* so recently as the club con- !
cert he displayed no matrimonial symp
toms, nor did he at the grove dilring the
recent heglra to the redwoods. And all
this while he harbored In his breast the
sweet secret, even to the preparation for
their future home. ' .
-Coming of -a family of charming and
Intelligent women. Miss RobiÂ£.3on has
made her influence felt in society and in
clubdom, being a busy member of- the
Spinner?, and latterly the clever progeni
tor of the Sequoia, which her executive
and social qualities have steered into
pleasant waters.
As to the bridegroom, he was for many
years connected with a local paper In
an editorial capacity, latterly , assuming
the editorship of "Sunset." which he has

It Is expected that .the; entire shipment
to be made by water will have been placed
In New York before It arrives there, and
If the experiment proves as successful as
McCormick & Co; expect 'it will be fol
lowed by others of a similar qOant'^y
and in this way a new'outlet for the reu
wood' lumber product of Northern Cali
fornia will have been established. !
Under the contract' the cargo Is to be
loaded at Eureka by' the middle of No
vember and, delivered In New' York fin
April. The value of the- cargo is about
$75,000 and promises to net a splendid
profit on the' investment. The, shipment
will interest all California lumbermen, es
pecially those engaged in the redwood lum
ber business, for it is in the nature of an
experiment. Of late a considerable quan-'
tity of redwood lumber : has been :shipped
by rail to Eastern points, one shipment
going- as far 'as â¢ Philadelphia," but little
of the favored wood has ever reached the
New York market over the transconti
nental linos. .
'-For several weeks Charles R.'.McCor
mlck & C.o. of. this city have been nego
tiating with A. B. Hammond and other
limber magnates of Humboldt County,
with a view- to securing a full cargo of
redwood lumber for shipment around the
Horn and the deal" was completed yes
terday with the chartering of tha ship
Argyle. :
An important deal, that, may mean
much to the future of the lumber, busi
ness in California, was effected, here yes
terday, -when contracts' were signed* for
the shipment of 1,500,000 fett of redw.ood to

MR. REDMOND brings a cheerful report from his country.
Better land laws and a remarkable revival^ of industries are
stopping the drain of emigration. He declares that the Irish
now have better chances and more opportunities, at home .-than
abroad. He says: "It is sad to see our people leaving their country
in such numbers, and I doubt whether a majority of them have bet
tered their conditions abroad. I have heard many sorrowful stories
of the unfortunate experience of Irishmen who have emigrated to
far-away lands, and I am satisfied that if those unfortunate people
had stayed at home they would be better off to-day."
That is good news for the whole world, for Irishmen are every
where, and they will be glad to know of the prosperity of the land
they left. Already there are signs of Return to Ireland of her ex
patriated sons and their descendants. The climate is clement, the
physical conditions charming and industrial opportunities, good. The
land laws permit the purchase of landed, estates, of fertile soil, near
to the best markets in the world, and the lure promises to call Irish
men home in such numbers, that the country will acquire its former
density of population, with the difference that they will be prosper
ous where formerly they "were poor.
As a political proposition this renewal of population will have a
directly beneficial effect upon the aspiration for home rule. An ex
cursion into the world and the enjoyment of complete political free
dom in other lands equip the Irish for the duties and responsibilities
of self-government, and the proposition for an Irish parliament will
be robbed of its terror to the English mind. Mr. Redmond's country
men in America hear his message of glad tidings with great pleasure.

THE State Board of Equalization at Sacramento is deep in the
annual dispute over the equalization of county, assessments of
property for taxation. The same board has been for a month
under fire over the subject of railroad assessments, and has suffered
the usual attacks upon its judgment and integrity, dictated by/ a
variety of motives, principally personal and partisan. Now it has
to listen to the attacks of county upon county and to the accusa
tions and retorts of Assessors upon each other! The whole process
is costly to the State, trying to the temper of the officials concerned,
and is clumsy and. unsatisfactory in the extreme.
An issue is made between San Francisco and Los Angeles
County. The people and officials of the latter demand a horizontal
reduction of 25 per cent in the assessment of their county y in order.
10 equalize it with San Francisco. â This raises the issue of an in
crease in the assessment of San Francisco in\'order to equalize
this county with Ix>s Angeles, .as the board has the option
to equalize by reducing the one or raising the other. Assessor
Dodge enjoys the confidence of the people of San Francisco, who re
gard him as an honest, ajid painstaking officer, very clear in his judg
ment of property values. Naturally Los Angeles looks upon him as a
monster of inaccuracy, who studies ways and means to avoid State
taxation for his own county and to put the burden on the metropoli
tan county of the south. The board is informed that realty assess
ments in Los Angeles are only 35 per cent of actual value, while the
San Francisco assessments are 65 per cent of that value. This state
ment, if well founded, proves that we are paying an entirely unjust
proportion of the State tax. Oddly enough, Assessor Ward of Los
Angeles is on the ground defending his assessment against his own
county Supervisors and resisting the reduction they ask.
In the controversy who shall say which side is right? After the
Board of Equalization has decided who believes that the decision is
accurate? The law compels a decision, but not even the members
of the board who make it will defend its infallibility. It will be
merely perfunctory, something done because the law requires that
there shall be some sort of a decision. After it is rendered no tax
payer in Â£an Francisco can be nforally certain that he is paying just
what he ought to pay, in State taxes, nor can any in Los Angeles
be sure on the same point. The wonder is that a law, long obsoleted
by changing conditions, gives one county the right to impeach the
assessment of another. The law mistakenly derives State revenue
from the same forms of property, source and assessment as the local
revenue. This primary blunder renders the State Board of Equali
zation necessary and causes the annual mixup and comedy of errors
at Sacramento. Xo doubt the members of the board do as near right
as they can in a matter in which no man can be sure that he is right,
and we do not join in any hue and cry. against them.
The attacks made upon, them may be usefully turned against
the defective law which makes their function necessary. It should
be replaced by a statute of taxation which will give the counties ab
solute home rule in assessment and levy, depriving them of the ne
cessity and therefore of the power to dispute and impeach each
others' assessment. This will be accomplished by the law suggested
by the State Grange, advocated by The Call, and now under con
sideration by a commission provided by the Legislature at its last
session. This law should separate State from local taxation entirely.
The property forms, values and privileges taxed for State purposes
should be exempted from local taxation. The property forms, values
and privileges taxed for local purposes should be, in turn, exempted
from State taxation. Then if the Board of Equalization survive in
any form it will be as a board of State assessments, to deal with the
valuation of the objects from which State revenue only is derived.
Each local assessor, knowing the budget that- taxation must meet,
could then make his assessment accordingly and the proper local
body could adjust thereto its levy for the year.
Under such a system the tendency would be toward a high as
sessment and a low levy. If it be true that the assessment of Los
Angeles is only 35 per cent of actual values, it is because that county
wants to shirk State taxation and is therefore Willing to submit to a
high levy for local purposes. Under the right system the temptation
to shirk would disappear and there would be a low levy for local
revenue. Then one county would not be at all concerned in the as
sessment of another, for each would be independent in the measures
necessary to supply its local budget. We hope the dispute between
different counties will be hot, for the reason that it will call public
attention to the present defective and imperfect system, and prepare
the public mind for something better. People often cling obstinately
to a defective method because custom has made it familiar, and
this disposition will have to be considered by those who hope to in
fctitute a reform.
"She had twelve ; children." said
O'Connor, simply, "but I was her baby,
and It seems like she loves me most of
all; and It did the old lady's heart good
to see me come back. You can '- see
Just how It would be yourself,, ma'am,
If your baby had been away, from you
for thirteen years."
The last that I saw of O'Connor tears
were In' his sad blue eyes. He looked
up from the gold piece in his hand to
say feelingly, in that melancholy, sub
terranean tone of voice he had: "Sure,
ma'am, you're the, first rale lady that
I've, met since I came here.'*
He had left a, good place, in New
York, -where he was earning:,' tips In
cluded, Â»2 50 a day, '.to return to his
native country to 1 work" which was
harder and less f congenial <. and ''for
which he received' $3 75 a vweek.- And
this he had done solely. for the sake of
his aged mother,; who" had \u25a0'\u25a0; longed for
sight of him, but who > had not had the
courage to go to him across the sea.
Now she was very feeble, and so long
as she lived he would not leave her
side. ,
"Oh, we hare a high opinion of Irish
men in America," I protested. , "Some
of our very smartest men come _ from
here."
"Yes, that's bo," agreed O'Connor. '"l
wlnt to America myself." \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 'tx^ -:'.
"Why didn't you stay there?" Ivasked 1
him, and from the expression that r came
into his eyes I realized that; lf had
stumbled upon one of the deep experi
ences of his life. The story that he told'
me is, I think, one -.that portrays 4a!
characteristic trait of; his warm T heart
e"d race. -';./.'' ; :/ ; ~ :''"-.' \u25a0 !-' r ;
"You wouldn't think, now, would ye,"
he queried,, "that peat-bog Irishmen
could do such work as that?"
My questioning proved this time, to
my great satisfaction, to be the enter
ingr wedge to an acquaintance which I
found as profitable as amusing, for my
waiter knew many things about the
neighborhood which were not In the
guidebook; so whenever' he '.was serv
ing me I encouraged him to speak-his
knowledge freely In tha^t sepulchral
undertone of his which was like the
echo of a hollow vault.
"You have a fine old. ruin in front of
the hotel." I commented.
His long, thin face lit up witha long,
thin smile that was as cheerful as a
streak of sunshine gleaming between
the boards of a fence. "It's the castle
of the O'Connors, ma'am. And my name
is O'Connor, too, so probably they was
my descindants," he confided. "But, If
so, it ainH. done me any good so far as
I can see," he went on disconsolately.
"I'm that poor, I am, though I may be
the son of a king." ? :
To cheer him up I spoke of the hand
some carvings In bog oak that I had
seen displayed for sale that . afternoon
at Kate Kearney's cottage, up by Dun
loe Gap.

tate they will inherit Is believed to bo
very 8 large. Mrs. Barnes was born In
Ireland, but came to the United States
when a child.' After her. marriage to
Barnes, who was very wealthy,^ she lived
in Mobile. During the yellow fever epi
demics she came to Louisville, j staying
with her mother here for "several months
at a time. She went to San Francisco
later and from there to Kiel, where her
husband's relatives lived. Mr. Barnes
died about twenty-five years ago, leaving
all his property to his wife. He was said
to be very wealthy.
Mrs. Barnes frequently visited Louis
ville from 1870 to 1875, but her relatives
saw little of 'her, for she was unusually
quiet. She was noted for her magnificent,
diamonds and was reputed immensely
wealthy. She told her relatives that her
agent here misappropriated a large part
of her fortune, but it was afterward said
she had recovered it. \u25a0 .
Mrs. Barnes had a child with her whom
it was -supposed she had adopted, but she
told her sister she had never legally
adopted him. and that. as soon as he was
21 1 he would be placed upon his own re
sources. After her departure from Louis
ville her relatives corresponded with her
for a time, then communication gradu

A great day was yesterday in the bor
ough of San Mateoâa festival day for the
country folk, by whom the De Guignes and
the Parrot ta are well beloved: bo. too.
was it a notable day for the elect, and
the foregathering will not soon be for
got, for it was gay as, a rose garden In
June, was this wedding of a maid of the
West and a Vicomte of fastidious France.
It is said that the groom will bear
away his bride, to dwell in the chateau
of his fathers, somewhere In the south
of France. ' .
Soon aftfT the automobiles and car
riages scurried away down the gray rib
bon of road to Bay wood, the country
home of the De Guignes. where the wed
ding feast was spread.
In the afternoon, the young people left
for Del Monte, where they will make a
brief stay.
In a most Informal way, the bridal
j.arty and the guests met in the vestibule,
and out In the glad sunshine of the
hunimer morning* where the bourgeoisie
beheld the bride, the Vlcomte that had won
her, the gay throng, the young nobleman
who Is yet unwed, the fair daughters of
that amethyst world Tcnt>wn to the un
initiated as "society" and the men that
dwell therein. . '- '- &
tcrial < women would call It chev
iot* a fancy wafstcoast. pale gray
trousers, no glove?, a pearl -tie and lilies
ff the valley where they ought to be.
Indeed, an Interesting groom wsÂ« Vicomte
<1* Tristan, even as was hiB brother a
distinguished attendant.
The ceremony over, the bride and
groom led the way to the carriagesâ a
bonny pair, radiant, self-possessed and
exchanging voluble greetings in French.
This for the Information of pros
pective groomsâ the Vicomte wore a
black frock coat of roujh ma-
Together they kneeled at the altar rail,
\u25a0while the most Impressive marriage cere
tr.onial known to the church of Rome was
crlcbrattd â a solemn' nuptial mass. And
a pretty sight it was, the foregathering
within the little chapel of the servants of
the household, the. villagers and the
guests, most of whom assisted in prayer
during the ceremony.
The groom?
A likely looking chap, oi clear, blue
eye*, pink cheeks, blonde hair and mus
tache, with a fine, manly bearing, fitting
v.ell the popular ideal of a French noble
man. "Not unlike Count Boni de Castel-
Jane." said many who had the distinc
tion of having seen the Cpunt, "but more
soldierly in his bearing, and a little
taller"â although the groom is not a tall
man, barely attaining the height of his
bride.
Preceding the bride was her maid of
honor. Miss Marie Christine de Guigne, a
younger, and a very pretty sister, wear
ing a white chiffon frock and a smart
white picture hat.
Following came the two attendants,
cousins of the bride, the MlÃses Abby and
Emily Parrott, both in pink chiffon
frocks, with large black chip hats, . sau
cily uptilted, bearing white plumes and
pink roses. Pink carnations made up the
bouquetsâ and incidentally a very fetch
ing picture.
At the altar, which was aglow with the
gleam of many candles, and gay with a
wilderness of Bermuda lilies, the groom,
attended by his brothei-, awaited his
bride.
Such was tho weeding day of Miss
Josephine de Guigne, who yesterday
Plighted her troth to the exquisite for
firner, Vicomte Phnippe de Tristan, eldest
Fon of the honorable house of De Tristan.
It waa In the little church of Saint
Matthew at San Mateo that the serTlce
was read, and at the hour of 11 all roads
Into the village led to Saint Matthew's.
Automobiles there wereâ a swagger lot of
themâ but the honors of the morning went
to the equipages, the smartest we know
hereabouts. As for the bridal coach, It
\u25a0w as a fit vehicle for so fair a bride, drawn
by a pair of matched yellow horses with
snowy tails and manes. "White satin rib
bons decked their haughty heads, and sil
ver bells chimed a merry tune as they
trotted off to the chapel.
When they drew rein at the church
door it was a fair picture that met the
gaze of the villagers and the tarrying
Bummer sbjourners as the bride stepped
forth in her ivory satin robe, enswirlcd In
clouds of tulle, a great bouquet of lilies
of the valley falling from her arm. With
her was her father, M. de Guigne, who
led her into the chapel ana who gave her
Into the tender keeping of the groom.
Lohengrinâ l often wonder how brides
reached the altar before Lohengrin was
Inventedâ proclaimed the coming of the
fair one, and then there was a polite
crush. , \u25a0 - '

FORT ERIE SELECTIONS.
Both Buddy "Ryan and Jimmy Gard
ner are practically through with all
work for their battle to-morrow night
at Colma. It has been no trouble what
ever for Gardner to be In good con
dition, as he was In grand, trim .for
Turner recently. The weight caused
him no trouble. Ryan is also down to
the required notch. He weighed 142 %
pounds yesterday, afternoon. Johnny
Reid, manager of Ryan, j says ! Gardner
will not ibe . giving away, the .weight
that has been talked of, but will in
fact be within a couple or three pounds
of what . Ryan weighs' when the two
get Into the rlngr. ;
Yesterday afternoon Ryan went
thrbugh the regular training exercises,
which included three rounds of boxing
each with George Herberts and Willie
Fitzgerald. .He will box no more be
fore the night of the fight," but will
content himself with light work to-day
and to-morrow. The same conditions
prevail In the Gardner camp. Jimmy
finished up the hardest part of > his
work yesterday afternoon and will con
tent- himself with, drying 0ut.,. t0-day.
The Lowell lightweight, weighs 138
pounds, but may.- pick-up a couple of.
pounds before he. goes Into the ring.
There _; were a few cxtravagant r bets
made last night in which. Gardner! was
quoted au. odds-on favorite^ This la
considered one of the hardest fights to,
pick a winner In of any that' has been
held here for many months. "Both men
are hard . fighters and a knockout -is
looked for before the end of : the stipu
lated number of rounds. As both, are
clever and bothJ are. known to j have \u25a0 the'

TACOMA, Aug. 23.â Hitt was the star
actor to-day, but one â¢ clean hit being
made off him. This was Lynch'slong
single," which scored Nordyke and
Eagan. Tacoma's other hits were
scratchy. Hitt also struck out nine
and fielded his. position like a veteran.
Even with Keefe, the Tigers could not
win, as; the boy . wonder was in poor
form and wild. :. The entire local team
seemed to run a race of errors, as
everybody â¢ booted the ball. "In the
third inning Gochnauer drew a pass.
Nordyke tried to head him off at second
on Wilson's drive and threw, wild. Hitt
forced Wilson and Sheehan nailed Wal
dron's hard foul. Mohler was passed
and Hildebrand's hit scored. two. Moh
ler was cut off third, but was safe on a
wild ;throw. . Irwln drew a pass and
Nealon singled. Graham's wild .throw
to catch Nealon stealing let two , more
in. . Three hits, a sacrifice and a pass
gave the Seals three more runs In the
sixth. Two scored in the ninth .'on Me-
Laughlin's error, stolen bases, Nealon's
double -and- two outs. Lynch finished
the game in the box. , The Seals are
now in first. place. , Score: -

he was kept from beating. .Burns, by
some one turning the lights but during

he had Burns at his mercy. Burns is

The injunction restraining the board
from using the money was secured by
Stephen V. Costello for his client. Miss
Mary McKenzie, who was formerly a
teacher and Is now suing for $8640 back
pay. Roncovieri maintains in his let
ter that the teacher is asking for money
that she has not earned. The case
is before the Court of Appeals for con
sideration. He also says that It is un
just for the present board to pay out
money to rectify a possible wrong of an
old board.
President Roncovieri of the Board of
Education yesterday wrote to the City
Attorney for an opinion as to the stand
ing of the board in the matter of the
procuring of funds from the annual
surplus of 1904-05 that are tied up by
a recent injunction issued against the
Auditor and Treasurer. The board is
in urgent need of money for the trans
action of its business, particularly for
the procuring of portable schoolhouses
to relieve the congested condition of
several schools.

take part in the big meet at Ingleslde
Da September 3. They will be accom

tries for the automobile, cycling and
motor races are expected to fill well.
ltrno Wheelmen Will Race Here.
To-morrow will be San Quentin day in
Nelson's programme. He will walk to
the prison, wnere he will be the guest of
the officers and guards. ;Bat has many
warm admirers and friends at the prison,
and has been a frequent guest of the
officials. He will do no gymnasium work,
as Nolan considers the round trip to San
Quentln, which Is fully ! ten miles, suffi
cient exercise for that day.
\u25a0Eddie Smith, the well-xnown referee,
and Dr. Hudson, the medical examiner
of the Lenox Club of New .York, and
many others were interested spectators
during Nelson's work In tne gymnasium.
Dr. Hudson, who precedes a number/ of
prominent New York sporting men who
are coming to the fight, will remain on
the coast until after the affair. ' George
Slier, Bat Masterson, Lou Houseman,
Jack Stlllson and other prominent sport
ing men of the United States will be
present at .Colma.
After luncheon he relaxed, his muscles
and read for a short time. He was the
target for several artists. In the gymna
sium he punched the sandbag, kept the
punchlng-bag moving, used the wrist ma
chine, skipped rope and did shadow-box
ing. He and Lundy tossed the medicine
ball for a few minutes. He then had a
lively and interesting three-round wres
tling bout With Lundy.- At 5 Bat mounted
his pony and . went for an hour's ride
through Ross Valley, returniiig at 6 for
dinner. \u25a0 . ' \u25a0 .
Bat and Jimmie Gardner had a body
guard of ten who helped them to warm
the county road. Smiling Metzner was
among the group, but by the time he
reached Kentfleld the smiie for once left
his beaming countenance, as he had no
more steam. He waited and rested at
Kentfleld and joined them on their home
ward jog. ; - :
â¢ Bob Lundy, one of the Olympic Club's
clever boxers, came over to-day expect
ing to have a three-round sparring go
with Bat. Manager Nolan would not take
chances of the split In his lower lip be
ing opened. He will have Bat and Lundy
spar three rounds in the twenty-foot
open-air arena on Friday afternoon. The
canvas for the arena was received to-day
and stretched on the floor of the arena.
Bat has been in the arena for short pe-"
rlods? getting accustomed to the glare of
the sun which beats down generously.
LARKSPUR. Aug. 23.â Another day
gone In the Nelson camp, and no boxing,
but plenty of hard work in the gymna
sium and on the county road, into which
Bat entered with enthusiasm and avid
ity. The weather this morning' was some
what warmer than yesterday ' and more
conducive to perspiration. Bat's mind
was not so worried about his celebrated
bag-punching bull terrier "Mike," which
disappeared Monday. He received word
to-day that "Mike" was chained up at
San Anselmo . and expects him returned
on Thursday.
Will Be Returned to the Camp of the
Flsbter To-Day.

Whether the Seattle - baseball : players

were simply out of form! was a question
yesterday at Recreation Park.* Whatever

they could have hardly lost if they tried.

RESULTS OF GAMES.
SARATOGA, Augv 25.â Interest in the
Adirondack handicap, the stake event of
the day, was somewhat reduced, owing to
the withdrawal of Athlete, whose last ap-.
pearance ;. before the Futurlt'y was' anx
iously awaited. Juggler ran out ahead
of his field in the " handicap, closely fol
lowed , by". Ravena, with Bill Phillfps a
nose ahead' of Tangle. Corning Into the
stretch, Ravena moved up and assumed
the lead. In the last half furlong. Tangle
suddenly; awoke and, coming with a rush
or. the outside, won in a driving finish by
half a length: ; Juggler came again in the
last. hundred yards. and took second place
from Ravena by a nose. ' Bill Phillips was
fourth,' a nose behind the rjanford horse.

XELSOVS MASCOT IS FOU.XO.
A curious objection was raiÃed to Jef
fries yesterday. It was claimed that he,
being so much larger than the two light
ers, would spoil the effect of the moving
pictures. Whether this will be held
against him by the boxers is not known.
Of the Eastern referees George Siler
and Malachy Hogan. who are the best
known, are both newspaper men who
have at times written severely of Britt.
The same is true of Bat Masterson, who
will be among the spectators at Colma.
Britt commenced his boxing practice
yesterday with Frank Rafael and Danny
Danziger. The work was all done in the
gymnasium, and the crowd was so large
an admission fee was exacted.
The list of eliffibles Is a short one un
less some one is selected who has not of
ficiated in this c!ty heretofore. Omitting
ihe names of .men who have failed to Rive
satisfaction, the list read*: Graney,
Wand, Welch. Smith and Kitchen. Of
these it is thought the Britt forces lean
toward Graney, while the Nelson people
favor Jack Welch. Â« Brltt accepted the
latter when ho fought Sullivan. Phil
Wand's services have often been sought
when each fighter thought he would win
and was willing to put his fortunes to
the test before a competent judge of the
game.
The next important detail of the Britt-
Nelson fight wiH be the naming of the
referee. The representatives of the fight
ers will meet in the office of Manager
Jim Coffroth on -.Saturday ; afternoon,
when they must, under the articles, select
the man who will preside in the ring.

MALARIA
UNDERMINES THE HEALTH
When the germs of malaria enter tHe
blood the entire health is affected, and if
the blood is not purified of these germs
and microbes, Chronic Sores and Ulcers,
Liver Splotches, Chills and Fever, Boils, â¢
Aches and Pains, and a great variety ot
troubles manifest themselves, and soon
the entire system is undermined, leaving
the sufferer a prey to a most miserable,
\u25a0weak and nervous condition.
913 "W. Market St., LoulbvUlb, Ky.
For several years I suffered with Chills
and FÂ«ver, caused by Malaria, in my
eyttem, and each summer for -several
years I would have a relapse, finally
my physician prescribed a. S. 8. I took
a few bottles; this was about six*
years arc It entirely cured me,' and
I hayÂ« never been troubled since. lam
sure no other medicine could have given
me so complete and immediate relief,
and I cannot speak too highly, of S. S. S.
2Â£y partner in business is now taking
S.S. 6. for an eruption of the skin, and
a general run-down condition of the sys-
tem, and although be has taken but one
bottle, already commences to feel better.
I. SHAPOFF.
S.S. S. counteracts and drives all the
poison from the blood and builds up the
system by its fine purifying qual-
ities and tonic effects. It strengthens
every part, increases the appetite, â¢ helps
the stomach and digestion, and by sup-
plying the body with rich, pure blood,
cures Malaria and all its disagreeable ail-
ments. Unlike

The W\ G. Henshaws of Oakland, who have
been making a trip around the world, re
turned on thÂ« China, full of the wonders of
their long Journey, but glad to get back. I~
L.. Fawcttt, a prominent New York politician,

While at Nusnagak the Salvator's peo
ple heard of a -battle between Italian and
Chinese fishermen at a cannery some
miles away. "Whisky is said to "have start
ed the' trouble, during which rifles and
revolvers are eaid to have been used free
ly. As far as could be learned nobody
was killed. â¢ .
â¢A- pay day such as raen who ship on
\u25a0whalers think they are, going to have
awaits every member of the crew of the
. schooner Salvator. which arrived yester
day from Nushagak with a cargo of
salmon. The Salvator carries forty men.
They are fishermen and sallormen com
bined and helDed to catch the red fish
f which fill the 4246 big barrels in her hold
and a lot of other fish coming down on
other vessels. Their pay is figured at so
much a fish, and every man on board
will receive from $500 to $703 for his three
months' work.
The Salvator arrived early yesterday
morning. She was boarded by the rep
resentatives of the marine exchanges as
coon as the anchor was down.' The -crew
wanted to land immediately. At Meiggs
wharf were half a dozen launches waiting
. until the Salvator should pass quarantine
to run alongside and bid for the business
of ferrying the forty ashore. As the Sal
vator was from a domestic port and had
on board no Chinese there was no quar
antine to pass, but before the men on the
launches at Meiggs wharf had found this
out the men from the exchanges had
landed the two score sailer fishermen at
the foot of Van Ness avenue.
In spite of their prospective wealth the
people on the Salvator did not live alto
gether In peace, and during one domes
tic . squabble the cook is said to have
stabbed the cabin boy.
Members of Crew Will
Each Get More
Than $500.

.\7.W YORK. Aug. 23. â The Improved out
t>ok for jH:ace at Portsmouth was a potent
factor in slitting the course of to-day's ttock
market. This tame feeling was reflected in
the foreign markets. Trading kept pace with,
the larce volume of the previous day. with a
cumber of substantial advance* and a much
wider distribution ot business. Heading and
the Eriee were leÂ«s co!i*picuous. their places
being token by a number of the higher grade
railway and the industrial shares. Neverthe
lt-se Erie common and second preferred ad
vanced to new high records. Reading recov
ered xo within a Jractlon of Its; record price,
but rts later Irregular. The best opinion Is,
that the operators with certain- large pools
took auvaiuago of yesterday's active market to
unload a large part of their holdings, but are
sjtfll Committed to higher prices. Trade re
ports at hand to-day bore closely upon coal,
copper Â«.nd iron and Bteci conditions. The re
cent rise in the coal shares is explained In
part by advices from the distributing centers
telling of iÃcreased activity. â¢ The renewed
Ftrerifftb of Amalgamated Copper, one ' of the
day's market leaders, followed', another 'â¢' ad
vsbce In the price of the metal and further
demands St borne and abroad for refined cop
per of which there 'appears, xo be'but a small
supply/. The "movement In copper to-day ..was'
accompanied by rumors of "an increased \u25a0 divi
dend on the stock In the future. The recog
nized autnerity in the' eteel and Iron trade
testified to very satisfactory conditions In that
Industry. The United States Steel shares

COPPER â 'With the exoeptlon of Amalga
mated, the coppers have remained quiet, duo
to legal complications In regard to the Cop
per Rang* Company. Unprecedented exports,
â¢ large and increasing home consumption and
email rtocka of copper on hand are the factors
that constitute the stable market position of
the metal. Consumption Is exceeding produc
tion, and tha tendency of prices is distinctly
upward in spite of efforts of leading producers
to prevent a runaway market. Amalgamated
is beginning to reflect the Improvement Jn the
company's affairs, and there seems to be lit
tle of the stock coming out on advances. Tho
company Ie now producing at the rate of 270.-
OÂ«} 000 pound* of copper a year and Its affairs
ere In better shape than ever before. We feel
that - the -standard copper shares are cheap at
present price*.
The Gould issues have at last begun to re
flect the progress being made in * the consum
mation of George Gould'B plans for a transcon
tinental line. Speculatively the etocks have
been taken out of their dormant state and bid
fair to become In time public favorites. For
eijrners we nothing but prosperity In sight for
Missouri Pacific In view of the excellent crops,
arrA liave been heavy buyers of the stock during
livr past week. It is cafe to say this stock will
not come out until higher prices are reached.'
Prieee of other granger Issues are steadily
creeping upward under a 6trong public de
mand; Rock Island. Atchison, St. Paul and
Union Pacific ail scored substantial advances
on the.-wt^k end look like going higher. In
terest In price movements has at last reached
the low priced Issues, and M.. K. & T. stocks.
Webash the Denver Issues, Wisconsin Central
an d Texas and Pacific are being steadily picked
up. â¢ AmoEg the Industrials, the equipment
shares are proving favorites by reason of ex
pectation of dividends on the common stocks In
the near future
ThÂ« New York circular cf J. S. Bache &
Co. says:
STOCKS â The week Just closed has been a
remarkable one in that on three days prices
established new high level marks in our Snan
c'.sl history. A large and increasing public
cemand for stocks has become the dominant
factor in the situation, overshadowing -s. feel
ins cf uncertainty m regard to the peace ne
gotiations arid in magnitude, large enough to
absorb profit taking sales, realizing by In
vestors who bought at a lower level and short
telling by professionals. Rumors of heavy dis
tribution of stocks by banking Interests lack
confirmation. The Morgan following Is bullish
and looking for a higher level of prices. Har
r'.rnan interests are said to have added largely
to tfceir enormous holding of Union Pacific
and some very pood buying of Union Pacific
during the past week was ascribed to the Hill
party. TnÂ« active Rock Island crowd are re
ported to be again in the market on the bull
side. There was undoubtedly profit taking dur
ing the week, but it is very doubtful If large
bs.nkers have yet begun to distribute stocks.
The week closed with prices firm at net ad
vances of .iSi for the industrials and 1.27 for
the active railroad shares.

Rock Island, Southern Railway. Smelting pre
ferred and Sugar. The last r hour was the
dullest period of the day. Heavy realizing
in the active list was largely responsible lor
the general declines, none ,of whivn. . however,
was very severe. Operators . In the various
pools seemed to have expanded their ammuni
tion and traders as a class were cautious to
the extent of carrying few overnight commit
ments. In the last few minutes of trading
there came a fresh outburst of speculation,
which carried such stocks as Union Pacific.
Missouri Pacific; Amalgamated Copper and the
Steel shares to the day's prices and drove the
shorts to cover. London waa reported to have
bought a considerable amount of stocks in
this market on orders for her own account
and for the Continent: . Local money conditions
continue easy. The bulk of to-day's call loans
were made below 2 per cent, while the rates
show a yielding tendency, four months' money
being offered at 3% per cent, as compared -with
4 per cent on the previous day.
The financial institutions with Important in
terior correspondents are agreed that In spite
of the probable increased crops the banks in
the West and Southwest will this fall finance
the crop movements to a greater extent than
In recent years. There will neverthelefiÃ be
heavy withdrawals of money now on deposit
here by the banks of those sections. Bonds

A writ to prohibit the Superior Court
from trying the case of the Election Com
missioners aocused by the Grand Jury in
ISM was denied by the Supreme Court
yesterday. Notwithstanding the so-called
Investigation ..made jby Mayor Schmitz, j
begun January I*. IÂ»>s. in which they
were acquitted, the court holds that the
Mayor -has no power in this case \u25a0 and
they will be. held to answer the charges i
before Judge. Lawlor. . '- i'
The whole point of the Election Com
missioners is that the Superior Court has
ma Jurisdiction because the charter of
San Francisco invests in the Mayor the
â¢power to remove the Commissioners; but
the Supreme Court held that by the re
cent decision of the Supreme Court at
Sacramento in the case of Coffey versus
the Superior Court, a like claim was pe
titioned for and denied. ?

and . John Spargp to . serve "on ; the , Elec
tion" Board in District 18 at' the' primary
election. August 9, 1904, while they were
not on the assessment roll for the year;
cecond, that none of these men . were
residents of the district In Â«\u25a0 which ; they^
were .to serve; and third, that three of
the men were holding municipal offices at
the time of their appointment.'
District Attorney Byington said that
the Election Commissioners must appear
In Judge Lawlor's court November 18,
1904, and answer the charges. The case
was delayed, and Mayor Schmitz, as part
of the machine aDpointing them, heard
the accusations and acquitted the ac
cused. It was still held that they must
anfwer the charges in the Superior Court,
jÂ»o the Commissioners, through Roberts
as petitioner, asked the Supreme Court
for a writ of prohibition.
The charges of the Grand Jury in 1904
against the Election Commissioners were
that they had been guilty of **willful, un
lawful and corrupt misconduct." They
were charced with being a part of a
fraudulent political machine and removal
from office and trial on the charges were
dem/mded. The Commissioners stated In
their petition that the Superior Court was
about to try the case after the Mayor
had once acauitted them, and their ap
plication for a writ of prohibition was
asked to prevent any further action. â¢
The most Important point the petition
ers made was that the Mayor had the

DECISION BASED
ON COFEEY CASE
Ford asserted that the company Is at
present employing 1 400 men to do re
pairing: at a dally expense of $2000, but
was unable to -say what dumber are
employed on street repairing: and what
number on track repairing:. The Mayor
expressed the opinion that fifty men
could do the work the Inspectors have
mapped out within a period of three
months If rig-htly used.' i
It was' suggested that , In repairing:
roadbed the company, should place
small obstructions about freshly laid
cement or bitumen to 'prevent teams
from driving: over and destroying: the
repair work. In conjunction with this
the Board of Works will send' notices

discuss the work of street railways in

(session was the- giving of a list of nec
essary repairs of roadbed rjorth of Mar

quest by the Mayor that the company
make weekly reports to him of the re
pair work as it progresses.
. The Mayor expressed his disappoint
ment over the fact that the - United
Railroads had not sent a representative
of Its construction department to be
present at the conference . and another
meeting will be called in the near fu
ture to enable them to be present. The
polloy.- of - the company was rated as
one 'of .procrastination and delay and
the Mayor added that if necessary other
means will be resorted, to to compel
the attendance of its construction rep
resentatives. Regret was v also ex
pressed by the Mayor, that no response
came from the Union and California

The puzzling question. whose. wife i 3 the
former. Miss ' Norine : Pearl ; Schneider \ has
been i made '. a I prominent , feature ;of the
trial before a : jury, in Judge Cook's ' court
of Ernest Moore Chadwlck. alias "Sir..
Harry Westwood Cooper, on a. charge of
sending , on 5 February 23, 1901, a false and
forged message - purporting to be from
another; person. The defendant -objects
to her testimony on the grouffd that she
is his ; wife and I cannot;- therefore, 'give
evidence against him. -. .
_' Since the former trial the young woman
has ' become the wife of B. J. , Kelly -of
Watsonville, and. Chadwlck has become
the husband of Miss Teresa Vanvelden, a
religious worker, and he is now the happy
father |of a . bouncing baby, . 14 months
old. Â» The' marriage took " place ;in\. the
County Jail ] about two years ago. II
Chadwick's contention Is correct. Miss
Schneider \ committed - bigamy t in ] marry
ing^ Kelly, \u25a0 and Chadwick committed big
amy in marrying Miss /Vanvelden. :
The point was , raised by Attorney
E'rank' J. Murphy for the defendant when
District Attorney Bylngton yesterday of
fered to , read : to the Jury. the deposition
of Mrs. ; Kelly, ; taken in" his office last
week.: ':, Murphy ..promptly- Interposed an
objection on the ground that - she was
-the wife of the defendant and could not
therefore testify against her. husband.
He filed . a marriage .certificate and an
affidavit for a marriage license In sup
port of ; his objection. -
; The District Attorney ' called Deputy
, County â¢ Clerk Dolan to the \u25a0] stand and
Dolan submitted the papers In . the case
of; Mrs * Chadwick against Chadwick " for
the;, annulment .of the 'marriage. They
showed that the decree had been granted
on September . 26, 1901, and recorded Oc
tober 9. An appeal had been taken on
April 9, 1902, -but had not yet been set
tled. It was argued by. the District At
torney 5 that . the - appeal had been taken
a day too : late, as the six months had ex
pired, but the ' Judge ruled against him. -
.The Judge said there was a stipula
tion to take Mrs. Kelly's deposition, and
the objection should have , been made at
that I time. Murphy replied that when
the stipulation was agreed to, he re
served all the legal objections]
The Judge l.eld that until the appeal
was ; disposed of> the decree . granting the
annulment- of ; the marriage remained in
abeyance ' and he would | have -_to . rule to
that effect. He thought- the matter was
.of such .importance, there being no use
of proceeding further "witn the trial If
Mrs.' Kelly's disposition [ was ho.t admis
sible,, that he would order a continuance
till this morning to enable both ; sides to
present authorities. I He suggested that If
the District Attorney s : could prove that
Chadwick was a married man at the time
of his marriage to Miss Schneider, the
difficulty ; would be removed. -V.' . " ~
