SAN ERANCISCO,- TUESDAY, "NOVEMBER 22, 1904.
JPROPOXENT OF BERTHA M. DOLBEER'S WILL, AND SOCIETY WOMEN \VHO JIAVE BEEX SXJBPEXAED TO TESTIFY.
Owing to a threatened relapse of
nervous prostration Juror K. A. Lund
strom .was excused from further serv-
I In , Judge Coff ey's court, Douglas
Sloane Watson, one of the witnesses
to .'the- contested will,, yesterday told
the Jury that Bertha Marion Dolbeer
was' "rational" â¢ and "of sound .mind"
when she executed her testament in his
office oh April 23 of the present year.
V.Watson was emphatic and to his
Snlnd there could be no question as to
the mental condition of the testatrix
at'the-time.- He had. known, her.inti
mately, for many years and did not no
tice the slightest change in her de
meanor.
. "Miss > Dolbeer was just herself," was
the terse way he put it. ' Not the faint
est 1 suspicion had been aroused in his
mind that her mind was affected, as
the contestant now contends. On the
contrary, she showed much intelli
gence In the making of the will and in
following the formalities of the law.
She exercised, a wise caution in its
preparation and for Its keeping.
r Mrs. Watson was Miss Dolbeer's cou
sin and one of her closest friends. The
husbandhad In some degree participat
ed in ".that intimate, friendship. Mrs.
Watson is a daughter of Mrs. J. L.
Moody,, who gave testimony -in behalf
of the "contestant, but is not in acr
cord, with her mother in her wish to
have the .testament upset.
On '-cross-examination Watson admit
ted that he expected' his wife to be one
of the .beneficiaries of the will he wit
nessed, but did not peruse. It tran
spired that there was no bequest for
her, 4 however,- but this did not warp
Watson's opinion as to the abilityof
Miss Dolbeer to dispose of her estate
nor affect his inclination to testify in
support .of j the will.

of the corpse of Jacob Ralston in his
cabin in the Sun River country by,
Leonard J. Lowndes. who had been

It had been alleged that the railways
were being paid altogether too* much
for their service. The amount paid for
transportation during the last year was
more than $38,000.000 â a quarter of the
entire expenditure of the Postoffice De
partment. The system of weighing
mails for a given period on which to
base contracts for four years was se
verely attacked, and it was said that
the railways received notice In advance
when this weighing was to take place
in order that the mails might be in
creased at that time. It was even
charged that members of Congress were
given the tip when the roads In their
districts were to have the weighing pe
riod that they might bulge the mails
with franked matter. .;Â»._
President Roosevelt and Postmaster
General Wynne- now believe that the
Postoffice Department is fairly clear of
dishonest practices and that the way
is open for administrative reforms. The
investigation of the second, assistant's
office 1 , so far as it has to do with the
transportation of the mails, has been
going on in secret for several months
and was ordered by the President be
fore Postmaster General Payne's death.
CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21.â In the inves
tigation of the office of the Second As
sistant Postmaster General in connec
tion with the awards of railway mail
contracts that bureau has received a
vindication. No illegal collusion has
been found between any Government
official and railway managers, but it is
possible that recommendations will go
to Congress as a result of this Inquiry
for changes in the method of awarding
these contracts. There is a well ground
ed opinion among administration of
ficials that a system of competitive bids
should be introduced so far as possible.

Gazing flown from his elevation upon
the stare at Lyric Hall to the floor of
the auditorium, that was filled with
delegates to the American Federation
cf Labor convention. President Sam
uel Gompers yesterday defied Socialists
end the arts of Socialism. This was
the really picturesque and dramatic
episode of the labor convention to date.
"1 expect no quarter from the So
cialists," he said, "and they need ex
pect r.o quarter from me."
In the gallery, where there had been
en hour earlier an almost riotous out
burst of enthusiasm when Max Hayes,
the Socialist leader in the American
Federation convention, addressed the
ho-use, there was dull and sullen si
lence. Seven thousand Socialists cast
votes in this city at the last election.
In the nation there were polled 1,000,-
Im!0 Socialist votes approximately. In
the Lyric Hall galleries there were
confn*es*i.ted hundreds of as determined
and able Socialists as there are in the
United States.
For some years the Socialists have
been heard of at the annual conven
tions of the American Federation of
Labor. On the floor they have tried
vo ec.-xirnlt the federation to their pro
gramme by the adoption of some reso
lution; they failed. Yesterday the bat
tle was resumed.
Ultimately it led up to a fierce al
tercation in which Gompers and Presi
dent John Mitchell of the mine work
ers denied statements published in the
Socialistic newspapers of the United
States. The denunciation was a part
cf an episode that started mildly
enough and terminated only when the
convention was at white, heat.
The convention had been discussing
the elimination from a resolution by
the committee on resolutions of a cer
tain introductory "whereas," which, so
thought the wily members of the reso
lutions committee, was intended to
commit the convention, under cover
and unwittingly, to a proposition op
posed to- capitalism, in other words to
private ownership, and that would put
the convention on record as saying that
it opposed the ownership of property
by an individual.
SUSPECTED RESOLUTION".
The resolution was introduced last
Tveek by Delegate Victor Berger of Mil
waukee, who is the editor of a Social
ist paper published in Milwaukee. Pos
ribly this fact and the other important
fact that Victor's paper has been strong
in Its condemnation of the men at the
head of the American Federation of
Labor, attacking them personally, may
have made the committee on resolu
tions more suspicious than might other
wise have been the case, that there was
a "bug" in the resolutions or preamble.
First Vice President Duncan, the sec
ond in command in the affairs of the
American Federation, is the chairman
of the committee on resolutions. In the
membership of the committee are also
Frank K. Foster, W. D. Ryan, J. C.
Balhorn, William Cohen. R. H. Met
calfe, Frank B. Monaghan, D. D. Mul
cahy, Santiago Inglesias, Archie Grant
end John Slocum.
Yesterday afternoon the resolutions,
ehorn of the first part of the preamble,
along with other resolutions was sub
mitted to- the convention in the usual
v.ay. Secretary Frank K. Foster read
the paper that made the subsequent
outbreak.
Vice President Duncan stood by and
when some one from the body of the
house asked why the first "whereas"
had been dropped off made an explana
tion. This set the ball rolling. The pro
gress was continued until it terminated
with Gompers defiant, the Socialists re
buffed and sullen, the delegates other
than Socialists in their war paint and
full of fight.
If there was any immediate cause
that put the spark to the inflammable
material of the convention it was a
fiery and cleverly adapted speech that
was made by Delegate Maloney, the
youngest man in the convention. .Ma
loney rose after an hour had been con
sumed in debate and made a talk that
had fire in the undercurrent. Â¦
Maloney is 22 years old, Irish by
parentage, red haired, of sandy com
plexion/ a printer from Lawrence,
Mass., tall and slim, active as a pan
ther and as full of "ginger" as might
b^ possible. He has a light, far-carry
ing voice, that when raised was dis
tinctly heard in every part of the hall
to the slightest accent and Inflection.
MALONEV MAKES ATTACK. .
As soon as Maloney was on his feet
he began to talk In a peppery fashion,
and from then on he did not mince
words. Close to him at the beginning
of his speech sat Delegate Victor L.
Berger, the Socialistic editor.
"I arn here," began Maloney, "not to
rpeak In the interest of any particular
party or to advance any political dis
ease. In the convention at Boston I
listened for a day and a half to the
debate on Socialism, and I cannot cast
a vote for the diseases of Socialism."
At this there was laughter along the
seats where the non-Socialistic mem
bers sat, but silence In the Socialistic
neighborhoods In the convention. Ma
i
loney did not pause, but went on, his
shrill voice rising higher and clearer
and more excitedly with each succeed
i ing sentence.
"The Socialists are opposed to the
principles of trade unionism in every
shape," he shouted. "The introducer of
the resolution that we have been con
sidering is Mr. Victor Berger, the edi
tor of a Socialistic newspaper in Mil
waukee.
"As the delegates passed out of this
convention, at the noon recess to-day,
they were handed a slip of paper, a
leaflet, on which was the question:
â¢Mitchell and Gompers, are they
traltors?'
â¢This question goes with' a statement
that Mitchell and Gompers dined at
the Exchange Club in Boston, with
President Eliot of Harvard University
and Thomas Hisrginson, and it is al
leged that the Exchange Club Is an
open or non-union house. Any and
every member of this convention
knows that it is a lie that the Ex
change Club is an unfair club. It has
never been so held."
Maloney was now so excited that his
voice was strained and almost to the
cracking pitch. His face was white
with excitement that was infectious in
the convention, where preliminary talk
had saved the way for an outburst.
"In this leaflet it is asked"â was fair
ly shriekedâ "why does the lover of
"ecabs." referring to President Eliot, so
like Mr. Gompers and Mr. Mitchell? At
the bottom of the leaflet are the words
â^'send 10 cents for ten weeks' trial
of the Social Democrat, Milwaukee,
Wis.. and keep posted on labor mat
ters."
BERGER WANTS PROOF.
Berger was on his feet in an in
stant and demanded to have a copy of
the leaflet about which Malonev had
been talking.
Maloney speedily made his way to
the stagre, calling upon President Gom
pers to deliver to him a copy of the
leaflet that was in the possession of
the president of the American Federa
tion of I^abor.
Gompers met him at the edge of the
stage, the leaflet held out, and this
Maloney took and went back to his
place near the front of the hall and
there held up the paper, while the
crowd applauded and Jeered.
Berger looked at the print and said:
"Of course this was sent out by the
business office and I, as an editor* hate
never seen it before. Of course I am
responsible for all that is in the paper
of which I am an editor and I will
make good on It; even in what is in
this leaflet."
Berger then moved down toward the
door and Maloney continued. He de
nounced the Socialists as "a dishonest
and hypocritical party"; alluded to a
remark on the floor that this country
might have a bloody civil contest and
said that if this were so it would begin
only after a Socialist victory. There
would, he said, be no bloody revolu
tion. He also attacked the Socialists
on the score that they had not come
into the convention as men, but had
come under a cloak. He told the con
vention that he was a printer and In
that way had determined beyond doubt
that the leaflet he held had been
printed at Berger's place in Milwau
kee.
CAUSE OF DISTRUST.
What had already happened was
dwarfed in Interest by what followed.
Amid cries of "question," when Ma
loney was through with his talk, the
delegates demanded a vote on the res
olution that had made all the trouble.
That and the preamble In full are as
follows:
"Whereas, ThÂ« unprecedented concentration
of wealth In the United States and the rapid
development of the truets in almost every
branch of Industry make It obvious that capi
talism will soon reach Its culmination point and
will have to make Â»-oom ror another phase of
civilization; and.
Whereas. It is evident that this nation Is
destined to take the lead In this grand strug
gle for better conditions and higher culture;
therefore, be It
Resolved, That we hereoy recommend to all
organization* affiliated with the American
Federation of Labor to have their members
study the economic eondltiorv to have lectures
upon these subjects In their lodgerooms and at
the mettlnRs eet apart for this purpose, and to
do everything Jn their power for the enlighten
ment and Intellectual advancement of the pro
letariat.
The first part of the preamble con
tains the words that the resolutions
committee objected to.
Early in the afternoon there had been
little stir In the debate until Max
Hayes, the leader of the Socialists in
the convention, rose to speak. Then all
necks. were craned to look at h(m and
all ears took In his speech of twenty
minutes. In which he spoke of Social
ism, and the gallery applauded wildly
until Gompers called the spectators to
order and forbade any demonstration
on their part.

Foster of the resolutions committee,
Ryan of the resolutions committee,
Treasurer Lennon, Delegate Dempsey,
W. B. Wilson and Delegate Zaring all
Epoke with more or less force against
bringing Socialistic discussions under
the terms of the resolution Into the

ON the train" in Colorado a Socialist said to me that it made no difference whether Peabody was elected or not. Of course it didn't. The Socialists don't live in
Colorado nor in the United States. They live in a sphere all by themselves. At the Boston convention there were both applause and hisses by Socialists
and, after repeated requests on my part that they refrain from demonstrations of either approval or disapproval, and finally a warning to them, I had the
galleries cleared as a last resort amid the hisses of the retiring Socialists. I ask no, quarter and I tell you now that I will give no quarter! . I deny the right of men,
or of any man, to insinuate, as Berger did two months ago, that "if Gompers thought changing his mind would elect him to the Presidency of the nation, he
woqld change his mind." â From Speech of President Gompers Before the American Federation of Labor.

In Buffalo, Jan. 22, 1903, President Eliot, speaking before 1500 high school pupils,
said: "In 1896 I took occasion to say in a public speech that *a scab is a hero.' I still see
nothing wrong in the remark."
On November 18, 1902, at New Orleans, the A. F. of L. passed resolutions condemn

he was, and often is, the guest of President Eliot at the Exchange Club, a notoriously unfair
place and under the ban of the Central Labor Union.

Why does President Eliot dine our President apd curse the rank and file ? Think it

is so limited.

can't denounce me. There iÂ» nothing you

Our friend. Max Hayes, charges me with
having arranged In "Washington nome time
ago, with the powers that be. to retire vol
untarily from the presidency of this organiza
tion in order to be appointed to the position
now held by Carroll D. Wright. I suppose
he meant that that was to be my reward for
assisting the Republicans. On the other hand.
The Worker, the official Socialist organ, de
nounced me as a traitor to labor because I
helped Parker. Isn't that glaring inconsist
ency ?
I am sure no man can eay that he saw a
written opinion or heard any expression' from
me regarding either candidate or elthv party
during the entire campaign. I tried to keep
the skirts of the American Federation of La
bor clear from the besmirching of Democratic,
Republican or Socialist parties. Maybe I don't
know how to do that, but, please God, I'll try
as long as I am able.
To the charlatan, the self-seeking, the ego
tist, who prostitutes his abilities and Influ
ences for self-aggrandizement and'.galn, such
charges may make no impression. But I am
human. I have spent the greater and best
portion of my life in the cause of labor, and
thene charges, false though they are, leave
their sting. But so long aa I retain my. san
ity I will raise my voice and use my pen to
keep trades unionism dear of the mire of poll
tics.

If this charge had been the only one di

paper of the Socialists is full or attack* on
the officers of the Federation of Labor. The

In West Virginia I found a former member

did so because they were afraid the men

give up their charter and join the Socialist
party because the unions would not admit the

A reception was given to the na
tional officers and visiting delegates to
the American Federation of Labor
Convention in the Alhambra Theater
last night by the Riggers' and Steve
dores' Local Union No. 222. H. F.
Keohn, president of the local union,
was chairman and addresses were
made by the visiting delegates. Dur
ing the evening refreshments were
liberally dispensed and between the
speeches vaudeville acts were intro
duced to add a spice of merriment.
Among the speakers were Samuel
Gompers, John Mitchell and James
Duncan, national officers; Daniel J.
Keefe of Detroit, John J. Joyce of Buf
falo and H. C. Bartell of Detroit, na
tional delegates, and Delegates Wig
nail and Abrams from Great Britain.
All were enthusiastically greeted and
their sentiments roundly applauded.
As was anticipated the 'convention
unanimously seated Schardt, represent
ing the Chicago Federation of Labor,
yesterday. President Gompers was in
structed to go to Chicago and endeavor
to impress upon the Chicago Federation
the necessity of complying with the
law of the American Federation. If the
Chicago Federation does not see the
error of its ways within thirty days
its charter will be finally revoked. Dur
ing the thirty days the matter will be
in suspension. In the meantime, how
ever, Schardt is seated and the Chica
go Federation has as much power in
the convention as if it had not defied
the convention by non-obedience to
commands by the executive council of
the American Federation.
A lively tilt took place on the con
vention floor yesterday in reference to
accepting advertisements for the Fed
erationist, the organ of the American
Federation, from "unfair" business
houses, to bring non-union goods be
fore the readers of the Federationlst,
all of whom are members of the Amer
ican Federation. A bunch of resolu
tions was adopted, among which was
one denouncing the Citizens' Alliance
of the Cripple Creek district in Colora
do, as "that gang of criminals." And
Governor Peabody was called "that
capitalistic tyrant." A resolution was
adopted for the exclusion of Japanese
from the United States. A resolution
that instructed delegates to move to
have the practice of law open to every
c-ne was rejected.
This forenoon the special order will
be reports from the Western Federa
tion of Miners.
The delegates to the conyention will
hold a mass meeting at the Alhambra
Theater to-morrow, night. -Among the
speakers will be Samuel Gc-mpers. J.

Meeting: at the Alhambra.
Berger secured the floor to make an
swer relating to the leaflet and the
agency of his newspaper therein. His
statement was as follows:
I had no knowledge of the squib issued by
the business office of my paper, but being
the associate editor of the paper I assume
responsibility, and if wrong is done 1 am
then subject to your censure.
I cannot see anything wrong In that squib
If you look at it in the right light. (I*ughter.)
There is no statement in that squib. It
"merely asks "Are Mitchell and Gompera
traitors?" There is a question mark. There
is no answer. Then it quotes a statement of
the Boston Herald that Mitchell and Gompers
dined at the Exchange Club with President
Eilot of Harvard, the enemy of labor.
I cannot understand why the business office
published such a leaflet, but it is simply ask
ing a question and not an expression of opin
ion. We do not believe in the policy of C-omp
ers and Mitchell and we take every oppor
i tunity of fighting them. I suppose this is one.
no time in the history of this organization has
the vote indorsing me been so unanimous us
that of the last year.
When these men are dead and gone few
will remember them. I feel sure that many
a hard working man will thank God that
there have been men good and true in the
labor movement who have guided It through
Its 8torm3 to the advanced positions it will
occupy.

the first row among the spectators and
she started a number of times to rise
from her chair while Pillsbury was tell
ing his story. Her lips were moving
as if the words she would utter "were
on her tongue, and a scene was looked
for. But Mrs. Phillips controlled her
self and 'the exciting incident that ap
peared momentarily forthcoming did
not materialize..
Pillsbury's opening statement was as
follows:
There. Is . but one issue in this case, the
question of the soundness of mind of Bertha
Marion Dolbeer. The' question at issue | is
whether Bertha Dolbeer at the time she made
her will had sufficient mental capacity to un
derstand the value of her act, had &Â¦ proper
comprehension of her. property interests and
of whom she favored with her bounty.
We expect to show that IBertha Dolbeer was
a youns woman of 27 years, of good educa
tion, of more than ordinary intelligence, kind,
lovable and considerate disposition. - of a char
acter that was respected and admired. She
had more than usual ability for one of her
years In managing her property interests, mak
ing investments and looking after her house

active part in society, giving entertainments
and beln? entertained, conversing on all sorts
of matters.

If the- proponents of the will make
out their case as Pillsbury says' they
will, there will be short shrift for the

thoroughness. But he did not forbear
to > apply the sting of invidious com
ment here and there on the contestant's
case. He said .bluntly that Mrs. Eliz

ice and by agreement of counsel the
trial proceeded with eleven jurors. At
torney-E. S. Pillsbury was engaged in
making the opening statement of the
proponents till late in the afternoon,
promising to establish facts by evi
dence it will take several weeks to in
troduce.
The complaint then avers that Flei
sher, in 1870, advised his wife to go
to her old home for her health. He
gave her $300 for the trip and when
she eot there she had only $50 left.
She made demands for enough to re
turn to San Francisco, but he sent
only small sums, not exceeding $100
in all, and at the end of seven years
ceased his correspondence. The wife'
states it is her belief that he was
tired of her and took thisTneans of
getting rid of her. He is characterized
as having been a licntious and profli
gate man. On September 4 last the
news of his death reached Krakau.
but the wife did not learn that she
had been divorced until October 5.
In support of the action for an in
junction it is stated that Esther Flei
sher is in possession of SC0.56C of per
sonal property belonging to the estate,
which is more than enough to pay
the debts. She has, it is said, agreed
to purchase the claims of Bernard
Fleisher and Mrs. Bush and Mrs.
Levy, when she would have the entire
estate under hÂ»^r control.
The first move toward getting the
estate of Wolf Fleisher for the woman
in Krakau, Austria, who claims to be
the widow of the deceased hatmaker,
was made yesterday by Attorney Ar
thur H. Barendt. He filed a suit to
set aside the divorce obtained by
Fleisher from his second wife in 1876
and for an injunction to prevent the
third widow, Esther Fleisher, from
disposing of the $250,000 estate until
the rights of the contestant are deter
mined.
The action is entitled Riffke Gluck
lidh Fleischer against Esther Fleisher,
as administratrix; Bernard Fleisher,
Rose Bush, Miriam Levy and Cecelia
Fleisher. Bernard is tha son of the
first wife, divorced, and Mrs. Bush and
Mrs. Vjjcvy are daughters of a dead
child of the first Mrs. Flelkher.
In the complaint it is first stated
that the deceased was also known as
Adolf Fleischer. He married the con
testant on February 12, 1867, and died
intestate on April 21 of this year.' The
Austrian claimant says that the en
tire estate of $250,000 is community
property and therefore hers.
On December 2, 1875, Fleisher com
menced suit in the Third District
Court for divorce on the ground of
desertion, alleging that his wife had
left him in 1868. On January 7, 1876,
In support of a petition "for publica
tion of summons he made an affidavit
that she was living at "Cricer, empire
of Austria." On April 24 the case was
heard before a referee and three days
later the decree vras â¢ granted. The
only witnesses were Fleisher and May
Tully. They testified that Mrs.
Fleisher deserted in 1870, a variance
of two yeara from the statement In the
complaint. ' . :
In basin- the charge of fraud and
perjury it is contended that Fleisher
knew there was no such town in Aus
tria as "Cricer," and that his wife was
at Krakau. Still he mailed the sum
mons to Cricer. It i3 declared that
he designedly arranged for the publi
cation of the summons and sent the
alleged notice through the mails Jin
order to prevent it- from reaching nis
wife.
identified the instrument shown him
and the Jurors were allowed to scrutin
ize photographic copies of it. The wit
ness related incidents of the visit of the
testatrix to his office on April 23. 1904.
to have him attest her signature. His
brother. Arthur S. Watson, was in the
office and when his name was suggest
ed for the other witness she acquiesced
at once. Watson proceeded:
I called her attention to the fact that wit
nesses wore unnecessary, inasmuch as it waÂ»
a holographic will, but she said sho preferred
to have It witnessed.
After the will was executed we engaged In
general conversation and Miss Dolbeer ex
pressed pleasure over her success in arranging
affairs so she could leave (or Europe. Con
cerning the testament, she said she had fol
lowed her father's will In making her own and
had not consulted an attorney.
A week or two later the witness met
Miss Dolbeer at a social gathering. At
no time did her manner seem strar.ga
or unusual. "Miss Dolbeer was just
herself," was Watson's answer.
"Was she rational or Irrational when
she executed her will?"
"She was perfectly rational; her mind
was perfectly sound."
Then came the determined effort of
Hiram Johnson to break down the tes
timony of Watson. It was a brilliant
effort, but did not avail with much ad
vantage. Watson admitted frankly
that he did not read the will before he
witnessed it and that he thought his
wife had been named as a beneficiary.
He understood she was so favored in
Miss Dolbeer's first will. He also ad
mitted that, he urged Ray Sherman and
Fred Moody, who are now not In sym
pathy with 'Mlsa Warren, that the fam
ily should stand together and uphold
the will. But he could not be shaken
as to the material points of his testi
mony.
While her husband was on the stand
Mrs. Watson left the courtroom, becom
ing nervous over the hot fire of con
testant's counsel In the cross-examina
tion.
The cross-examination will be re
sumed this morning.
On application of the attorneys for
the proponents of the Dolbeer will.

mission Issued to David < Sullivan of

Lena E. Thompson, also of Gale. Per

John Dolbeer in his will spoke of Miss War
ren as a â¢ member of the family and left her
a bequest of $25.0CO. And Miss Dolbeer in her
lifetime had said that Miss Warren had been
a mother, brother and sister to her. They were
like sisters, and the testatrix said she would
make provision for Miss Warren, no matter
what happened. No person could have been a
more proper selection for the bounty of Miss
Dolbeer.
TELLS OF EXECUTION OP WILL.
Douglas Sloane Watson was the first
witness for the proponents. As one of
the witnesses to the conte3ted will, he
We will Fhow that on April 27, when MlsÂ«
Dolbeer started for Europe, she was happy
and natural, and spoke enthusiastically of her
trip. Cn her return lo New York Miss Dolheer
took apartments with Miss Warren at the Wal
dorf-Astoria. The morning before her death
?he bought tickets for San Francisco and drew
money from the bank. ' She attended to her af
fairs intelligently and sanely.
M!ss Dolhcer m<"t her death by falling from
a window cf the hotel. No human being can
tell ,the exact circumstances of her death, for
no hurran eye saw her. It is quite as probable
that the fatality was accidental or intentional.
This contest was Instituted by Adolph
Schandor. a brother of Miss Dolbeer's mother.
In a procee-.ling In the early stages of this con
test he said under oath that since Mias Dolbeer
was three years of age he had never spoken a
word with her. She was pointed out to him
about three years ago, and after Â¦ that he Â«a*
her on the street once. We will show that
Mi?s Dolbeer did not know whether Adolph and
Horatio Schander were in existence. The other
helr-at-Iaw, Mrs. J. L. Moody, a sister of the
Schandorn, was in affluent circumstances and
there was no occasion for Mlsa Dolbeer to re
member her.
The residue of Miss Dolbeer's estate was be
queathed 'lo-Miss Etta Marion Warren. Shs
provided that In the event of the death of Mtvs
Warren, who was 38 years of agÂ« when the will
was rrade. before that of the testatrix, who
was then 27 years old. Mrs. Douglas Sloane
Watson, her oousin. should taka the place of
residuary legatee.
Every person named in the will was a proper
beneficiary and naturally to be selected by Mlsa
Dclbcer for her bounty. All were denervinff.
with one exception. The exception in Elizabeth
C. Phillips, to whom was left $10,000. Mrs.
Phillips subsequently demanded $25,000 from
the executor!), under threat of testifying in
support of a contest of the will.
MRS. PHILLIPS AFTER JIOXEY.
"It's money I want, and it's money I'm af
ter," was what Mrs. Phillips told the execu
tors.
The bequest of $10,000 to Ethel P. Roche ex
plains Miss Dolbeer's decision to destroy her
first will and make another one. Miss Roche's
mother died after the first Instrument was exe
cuted and the young lady was compelled to go>
out to earn her livelihood. Miss Dolbeer's
sympathy was aroused for the girl.
Early In the present year Miss Dolbeer
planned the trip to Europe, which was delayed
a few weeks because her physician insisted
that she take the "rest cure." her activities
In society having taxed her strength.
On April 23. 1604. Miss Dolbeer executed her
lust will She had made a previous will, but
she destroyed this one. On April 23 she went
to" the office of Douglas S. Watson and asked
him and his brother to witness her testament,
she dating and signing the Instrument in their
presence.
In April. 1902. John Dolbeer was taken East
for the benefit of his health. They returned
durinr the summer and In July went to Del
Monte, because John Dolbeer was becoming
worse. They came back to San Francisco on
August 1 and on August 13 John Dolbeer died.
We expect to show that after some months
Miss Dolbeer recovered from her grief over her
father's death and a sain took up association
with her friends.

Tatsu pursued and overtook the
steamship at 5 o'clock in the morning.
On board the vessel was found a

PHOENIX, Ariz., Nov. 21. â Au
gustln Eina, Mexican Consul at this
post, was placed in a somewhat deli
cate and embarrassing position to-day
as a result of E. P. Valentine and
George T. Black of El Paso, inspectors
of the Treasury Department, seizing a
quantity of Mexican drawn work of
fered for sale at a small . store con
ducted by the mother of the Consul.
It is alleged that Mrs. Plna, or some
other member of the family, smug
gled the drawn work from Mexico
through the port at Eagle Pass, Tex.
The inspector- 1 -refused to make any
statement or give the value of the
confiscated goods, saying that they
could report only to the department.
Consul Pina says the value of the
goods is less than $100 and that a por
tion of them were manufactured in
Phoenix.
Consul Pina says his mother is rais
ing two orphan children who are
adepts In making drawn work, which
art they learned In Mexico, and that
the Mexican goods confiscated were
given to her and were brought into
this country under legal privileges and
placed on exhibition to stimulate the
sale of other goods made by the orphan
girls in Phoenix. He Insists that he

â¢Weber appeared in court to-day
wearing a boutonniere of violets sent
him by Miss Trousdale. . The \ young
ladyis a waitress at, the American
Hotel, and.youn Weber called t* -e
occasionally.
Arrangements are about completed
whereby special counsel will be em
ployed on both sides at the final trial.
L. L. Chamberlain of. Auburn and
Hiram Johnson of San Francisco will
probably assist Attorneys Fullen and
Tabor- in the defense, while George
W. Hamilton, son of the late General
Jo Â¦Hamilton. 'will likely be employed
in, the -prosecution.
Miss Clarke's story of the route
taken by Weber will make it easier
for the searchers for the missing pis
tol. Between the Weber home to the
brewery are several springs, and be
tween the brewery to the town is a
ravine. A portion of the ravine was
raked to-day and the search will be
continued to-morrow under the su
pervision of a Pinkerton detective,
Charles H. Relmer. who Is here at the
Instance of Sheriff Keena. The search
will be systematic and may take sev
eral days.
. In talking with The Call corre
spondent to-day Detective Relmer said
there was little doubt but that Sheriff
Keena had the right man, and that
from now on links In the circumstan
tial chain would â¢ come much faster.
Reimer had a srood opportunity to
study the prisoner yesterday in the
Sheriff's office., . The detective be
lieves the young man has an abnor
mally d evel Â°P e cl brain; that he has
great concentration and will power,
but that It. is only a question of time
when he will break down. Reimer
saldVoung Weber reminded him of
Parker, the Boston man who mur
dered his entire family. Weber's
head is very long from front to back,
and his face Is very short. The most
remarkable peculiarity, however, la
the closeness of his chin and Yiose;
they nearly meet, and his mouth la
but a slit. - - : -7 .;-:- 1
Reduced to a connected tale Miss
Clarke's testimony Is as follows: "I
was out In the yard gathering wood
when I saw Adolph Weber pass the
house. It was between 6:30 and 7
o'clock. I went Into the house, dressed,
and went uptown for the mall. When
I arrived at the postofflce I saw Weber
standing alone outside. This was
about 7 o'clock. . I . started back home,
and was nearly there when I noticed
the fire. I ran back through Chinatown
to town and gave the alarm." ('
Clarence Geer testified that he was
at the fire early and that as he ran
round, the house Weber was with him.
They stopped in front of the house and
Geer never saw Weber afterward. Geer
said he was on the porch and In the
room where the bodies were found, but
did not see Weber there. Weber claims
to have been In! the room and to have
helped take out the body of his little
brother. Earl.
Fred Bernhard testified that he was
present at the flre and did not see
young Weber on the porch or inside
the building.-
Dr. J. F. White was called upon by
the prosecution and testified that he
made an examination of a pair of
young Weber's drawers, already an ex
hibit in the case. Th'e doctor said he
made a test of a stain found: on the
garment and t discovered blood by both
the- microscopic and chemical tests.
The same results had been obtained In
a lesser degree from an examination
of a portion of young Weber's,trous
ers, said the doctor.
Dr. White is an expert chemist, and
his analysis was to-day confirmed by
Dr. Rvfkoeel of San Francisco in a
letter to Dr. White.
The preliminary examination will
be continued to-morrow morning,
when two other witnesses who saw
Weber pass through Brewery lane
will be Droduced.

STARTLING STOEY
OF A YOUNG WOMAN
MUKDEN, Nov. 21. â The Russian
detachments occupying Da Pass have
retired before a Japanese- column 1000
strong. The Japanese are reported to
be advancing toward Sintsintin.
Since the Japanese attack on Pouti
loff Hill on the night of November 18
no activity has been apparent. The
character of the attack on Poutiloff.
Hill is not fully understood beyond the
fact that three or four battalions par
ticipated. It probably was made on
the initiative of the local command
er, without the consent of headquar
ters, and as an attack it can be fa
vorably regarded only in the light of ,
a reconnaissance in fprce.
This incident is the most important
that has occurred since the battle of
the Shakhe. Poutiloff Hill, which is
now the center of -.interest of the en
tire line, could be seen ; flashing the i
signal of attack from her fortifications
as the Japanese infantry advanced.
On' account of repeated reports that
the Japanese intended to attack on
November lathis assault was believed
to be the signal for an advance of- the
entire line and consequently the en
tire Russian army, already on the qui
vlve, began its own hostile movements
both east and west of Poutiloff Hill. '
The Japanese arrived within fifty,
yards of the Russian trenches. The
Russian fire was too deadly for a fur
ther advance. The next morning dis
closed about eighty Japanese dead,
which the Russians buried on Satur
day. The Japanese succeeded In car-,
rying off in haste 200 wounded. The
Russians lost a half dozen men in the
trenches. . ' \', *
Scouting operations on both' sides
result In daily encounters, sometimes
between battalions, but the encounters
are little more than skirmishes. The
scouting is for the. evident purpose of
identifying opponents' positions and
local- strength. ;
The Russians continue to daily shell
the Japanese position at Linshenpu. %
BERLIN, Nov. 21. â A dispatch to
the Lokal Anzeiger from Mukden,'un
der to-day's date, says:
"The reconnaissance fights have as
sumed a more violent character ; dur
ing the last few days. Particularly
hot was the fighting on Poutiloff
(Lone Tree, ) Hill, where the Japan
ese were repulsed with the â¢ loss of
more than 100 killed. â¢ : â¢

with the outside world.
"The health of the troops is excel
lent. The Russians admire the clean
liness, perfect order and equipment of
the Japanese. One does not see any
trace of race hatred. It is a fact that
the Japanese return, through French
intermediation, all valuables found on
dead Russians. This has made a deep
Impression here and la reciprocated."

WE WANT Â«
MONEY BACK
Â¦ Â¦ ' Â¦ Â¦?
We Had a Good Thing and We
Lost It, but There Are Oth-
ers; We'll Meet the Issue
â¢
WE NEED THE MONEY
Â¦ â ?
We May Be Biting Off More
Than We Can Chew, but
We'll Be There at the Finish
To those who may be Interested in the
purchase of a piano at this time, and
who have the spare cash at hand, we
have a statement extraordinary to make,
and one that we believe has never hereto-
fore been made by any other piano con-
cern in the United States, and' which, no
doubt, the music trade will consider at
this time a reckless and risky thing to
do, but as cash cuts an Important figure
with us just now, we have decided to
make a bid for It by venturing the most
nervy and apparently impossible thing
ever attempted by piano man â that ot
undertaking to sell at retail In ten days
130 costly, new upright pianos for spot
cash; and In pursuance of which under-
taking we wish to make the following
frank statement:
,.. Who has not heard of name and fame
of the beautiful "Weber" piano? Well,
we have lost it.
We have lost the agency for the Weber
piano, with Its kindred makes â the
VWheelock" and "Stuyvesant" â and we
want our money back. *
For the past six months we have been
kept In suspense as to whether or not we
could retain the Weber agency.
The Aeolian Company, which built the
Pianola piano player, and the^ Weber
Company, who build the Weber pianos,
consolidated their New York factory in-
terests - some months ago, and since
which time- it has been the policy of the
company to combine their Pianola player
and the Weber piano with one dealer In a
city,' Where they had formerly been han-
dled t%. twoâ for lnstance^ â The Pianola
has been handled for many years In San
Francisco by. a friendly competitor of
ours, while we have handled the Weber
piano, > and we are both willing that the
agencies should remain with each as
they are,- and always have been. But the
combination^ of factory Interests in the
East apparently wills It otherwise, and
we. It seems, are up against It.
The matter has been hanging flre for
six months, while we, with hopes of re-
taining the Weber agency, have bought
heavily of the Weber house, much more
so than we otherwise should have done;
bought Webers, Wheelocks and Stuyve-
sants â all built by the Weber peopleâ â¢
bought and bought and kept buying, till
the walls .of our wareroom are almost
bulging out with Webers, till we have
depleted our bank account, and turned"
our pockets -wrong side out. In order to
prove- that .we are good fellows, and
worthy factors to be reckoned with In
the field of Weber agencies, and still It
seems we have lost. Well, there are
others!
This may be telling tales out of
school, but facts are sometimes stubborn
things, and there Is no use to be mealy-
mouthed about itÂ» or beating around the
bush. We have gone the limit, and now
we are going to "buck." We are going to
back up. We are going to unload.: In
facti we^are going to Jump from under
the loadâ going to cash in and take a
new tack.
In order to liquidate past alliances, and
take Immediate advantage of high-grade
agencies now open to us to take the
place of the "Weber line," we shall need
I in the neighborhood of $30,000 cash, and
Â¦we are going right out to get It. And
while we shall throw nearly a hundred
and thirty high-grade pianos, including
over sixty fine and costly Webers, on the
market to-morrow at a scandalous price
to accomplish that object, It must not be
understood that we are going out of busi-
ness, for we are not, but quite to the eon-
trary. To use an ugly phrase, we have
"got our backs up." and are just going
into the business.
The house of Clark Wise & Co. has not
been in the habit of making periodical
fake piano sales. They have never en-
gaged In a fake sale, nor never will. We
do not carry the class of goods that
could be profitably used for ' that pur-
pose. T-lv
This is a bonafide square deal; a spot
cash piano sale of one of the finest and
highest grade pianos made in the world
â the "Weber" â universally recognized
by all great artists as the equal of any-
thing in the piano line yet produced by
man; standing head and shoulders over
practically anything In its class; recog-
nizing no superior, and but one possible
equal â such is the "Weber!"
And these are the pianos we shall offer
the public in this sale to-morrow for less
than the price of an ordinary piano.
Many, many dollars beneath the dignity
of a Weber.
To here state. that we propose to offer
these pianos at cost would be superflu-
ous â a waste of words â for Â¦ the mere
fact that we feel called upon to under-
take the stupendous proposition of sen-
Ing 130 costly pianos in ten days for spot
cash carries with it the implication that
we will do even worse thanNthat; for tne
man would be considered insane who
would undertake to sell 130 costly pianos
in ten daya for all cash, and at a profit.
The man who could do that, this earth
Is his cabbage pateh.
It is sufficient to know, and for us to
say, that we intend, if it Is possible, to
sell every piano of the Weber line now
in our warerooms within the next ten
days for cash, and that we do not expect
to emerge from this undertaking with a
dollar profitâ in fact, we are prepared to
lose any reasonable amount that may be
necessary to accomplish the object for
which this sale Is inaugurated, and. all
we ask of those who ever expect to own
so fine a piano as the "Weber" is that
they give us an 'opportunity to show our*
good faith in the matter. -. . Â«
We have stood by the Weber piano for
a 'good many years in this city, and the
Weber piano has stood by us, and to here
quote in black and white the astounding
low spot cash figures at which theWeb-
ers will go -in this sale would be doing
Its future representatives here, as well
as the manufacturers, a great injustice,
and as much as we feel Inclined to quote
figures on the Weber â which it seems to
us should sell every Weber piano In our
wareroom in a single day â we must con-
tent ourselves with the inferences that
must be drawn from what has already
been said, and the further additional gen-
eral statement, that we intend to uis-
count, v in this- cash sale, ' from $160 to
$275 from- the regular Weber retail
prices â according to size and design.
We have other fine makes of pianos â^
brand newÂ»-that will go In this sale at
$295, $267. $242. $228. $196. $165, $137
and on down to $106, all cash.
A strongly worded, written guarantee
from us, in addition to that' of the man-
ufacturers, will accompany each instru-
ment sold. â¢ â¢ ,: â¢ .'Â¦Â¦-.,*- . .* .Â¦Â¦;â¢
This sale, as above, began just a week
ago this morning, and has been a phe-
nomenal success, considering It an all-
cash saleâ over $5000 cash- taken in on
Webers the first day.
Our assortment of ; "Webers" has^not
been broken yet, and we take occasion to
here guarantee our patrons. many dollars'
more value. In strictly high-grade pianos,
for their, money to-day than has ever be*
fore been given in this city. 'Â¦ . '-/
We know what has been doneâ what is
being doneâ and what can be done.
There's no mistake about It.

transferring of all newspapers for out
of-town circulation to the early trains
through the tunnels. The tunnel will
also be used- for the transferring of
mail between the main postofiice an-1
the railroad stations and between rail
roads. The letter boxes will be so con
nected with the tunnels that when mail
Is dropped in the boxes it will drop
down to the level of the tunnels and
be taken to the postoffice. The tunnel
provides a means for the transporta
tion of freight and of handling it ex
peditiously without compelling the rail
roads to absorb high-priced property in
the center of the city for freight pur
poses. Freight yards can now be
moved out ten or "fifteen miles and the
freight transferred and the trains run
into the passenger stations with electric
locomotives, thus doing away with over

FAINTS IN COURT WHEN
JUDGE GIVES FREEDOM
Wackford was passing a house at 938
Mission street, on his return from the
Central Methodist Church, when he ac
cidentally trod on a woman's skirt._ He
attempted to apologize, but the woman
disappeared into the doorway. Wack
ford continued on his way to 926 Mis
sion street, where he roomed. When
he was almost at the threshold of the
house a man' rushed up to him and
shouted: "You insulted* my wife!"
Wackford, who was a courteous and
quiet man, several years past the
| prime of life, attempted to explain, but
I the other man, who â it was afterward
learned â was Donahue, would listen to
no explanations, "i'ou insulted my
wife!" he repeated, and struck Wack
ford on the temple. Wackford fell,
striking his head forcibly against the
pavement. For some time he lay stun
ned. When he recovered his oenses he
entered the house where he lived and,
with 'the assistance of Edward Fraser,
his landlady's son, went to the Central
â¢Emergency Hospital.
When Wackford arrived there he had
apparently recovered from the effects
of the fall and there was nothing to in
dicate that he had been hurt except a
slight cut and a few contusions of the
scalp. Dr. Pinkham dressed these, and
as the patient insisted on returning to
his home the surgeon permitted him to
go. He showed none of the symptoms
of a fractured skull.
Yesterday morning when the land
lady attempted to wake him Wackford
was found to be in a serious condition
and was barely conscious. An ambu
lance was sent for and the Injured man
was again taken to the Central Emer
gency Hospital. By that time he
showed pronounced symptoms of a
fractured skull.
Seeing that an immediate operation
was Wackford's only chance for life.
Dr. Pinkham and Dr. Pawlicki had him
removed to the operating room and at
tempted to trephine the skull, but
Wackford died on the table.

"struck Wackford because ttte man had
intentionally insulted his wife. Dona

of an unconfirmed report published on
Sunday that she had foundered, an
chored in quarantine to-night. She will
proceed to her dock to-morrow morn
ing.
While the report of the foundering of
the Kroonlaud was not taken seriously
by the steamship company officials, it
caused considerable anxiety among
those who l|ad relatives on the vessel,
and the news that she was sighted off

learned of the report through a tele
gram of inquiry from an anxious
friend. The Kroonland on this trip car

cabin passengers.
Among the passengers was General

partnership that was congenial and
advantageous In all respects. This was
given as his only reason for retiring
from .public life. It was known for
some time that the office of Attorney
General of the United. States was en

Swears to Charge of Murder.
The motion to set aside ithe informa
tion charging Charles Wyman with
fraudulently voting at the primary elec.
tion on the ground that the defendant
had been illegally committed was ar?
gued before Judge Lawlor yesterday
afternoon. The point at issue was that
Judge Cabaniss had erred in taking
testimony while the defendant was out
on ball on the application for a writ
of habeas corpus before Judge Sloss.
After considerable argument the
Judge denied the motion, holding that
whatever irregularity may have been
committed by Judge Cabaniss it was
not such a departure from the strict
rules of procedure as to prejudice the
substantial rights of the defendant. At
torney Countryman was allowed thirty
days to prepare a bill of exceptions to
the Supreme Courts Countryman then
interposed a demurrer to the informa
tion on several grounds, among them
Judge Lawlor yesterday morning de
nied the motion to quash the indictment
charging Joseph Rebstock with a viola
tion of the election law in refusing to
administer the oath to a voter whose
vote was challenged at the primary
election while he was acting as an in
spector. The defendant's attorneys were
granted a stay of thirty days to pre
pare a bill of exceptions to the Supreme
Court.
Attorney Newburgh then filed a mo
tion to terminate the proceedings on
the ground that prior to the filing of the
indictment the defendant was com
pelled to attend ur>on the Grand Jury
as a witness and testify against him
self, in violation of his constitutional
rights. He also asked the privilege of
producing oral testimony In support of
his motion. District Attorney Bylng
ton objected to the motion and the
Judge sustained the objection..
Newburgh thereupon interposed a de
murrer to the indictment on the ground
that it was not alleged that the defend
ant had ever qualified to act as an in
spector. There were other grounds,
among them that the administering of
the oath was not mandatory and that It
was unconstitutional, as it destroyed
the secrecy of the ballot. The argu
ments on the demurrer will be made
this afternoon.

harbor, had been connected with the
cheap fuel that would enable its pro
jected commercial enterprises to com
pete with the cities of the world- and
make it possible for the local capital
ists to put upon the markets the vari
ous stone products, glass sands, ce
ment, lime and other natural resources
that had hitherto been undeveloped
because of the lack of cheap fuel and
transportation.
The first toast of the evening, "Cap
tains of Industry," was answered to
by F. H. Powers. He -spoke of Collis
P. Huntington as the master of the
captains of Industry produced by the
great West. He reviewed that devel
opment of California and particularly
of San Francisco under the guiding
hand of Huntington. He showed how
the necessity for the development of
San Francisco had prevented the de
velopment of Monterey andÂ» insisted
that the projecting of the pipe line
by the Matson Transporttion Company
and the completion of the wharf giving
to Monterey, with Its splendid harbor
facilities, the advantage of accommo
dating the largest deep water ships,
would be as important in developing
Monterey and bringing to it the hew
growth incident to the coming- of new
capital as the building of the Central
Pacific Railroad had been to making
San Francisco, the great metropolis of
the Pacific Coast.
"Monterey, with Its deep -water har
bor, with its varied resources, with the
cheapest fuel of any seaport city of
the world, will," he said; : ."become
to San Francisco and the Pacific Coast
what the city of Boston is to New
York and the Atlantic Coast.'" '
Tho banquet was a triumph of
originality. The table, beautifully
decorated with. pa lms and flowers, was
In the shape of the letter "LV" General
Quinton'. U. S. A. (retired), chairman
of the Monterey Chamber of Com
merce, was seated at the center of
the lower end of the "U" as toastmas
ter. At his right was Captain Wil
lian Matson, president of the Matson
Transportation Company and the
Conlinga Oil Company, who was the
guest of honor. At his left was Judge
Cope of Morrison & Cope, attorneys
for the company; Colonel Ward, Fif
teenth Infantry. U. S. A., in command
of the post at Monterey, and F. H.
Powers, Mayor of Carmel; Hon.
Thomas Field, president of the Bank
of Monterey; Hon. Ross C.*Sargent,
president of the City Council, were
also at the speakers' end of the table.
The steamer Rosecrans of the Mat
son Navigation Company's fleet was
loaded with 23,000 barrels of crude
oil at Monterey yesterday and will sail
for Honolulu with the first cargo load
ed through the pipe line from the
Coalinga field in Fresno County. Last
Saturday evening Monterey held Joy
ful celebration of the dawn of a new
era of shipping and commercial ac
tivity that the enterprise of the Coal
inga Oil Transportation Company has
brought to the historic town.
The various commercial and social
organizations had prepared a pro
gramme that will long stand out In
the annals of Monterey. There was a
salute of fifty guns and a grand recep
tion by the citizens when the newly
equipped oil steamer arrived Saturday
afternoon. In the evening the Fif
teenth Infantry band gave a concert
in front of the Monterey Hotel. In
tho hotel was served a banquet, over
which Charles Dickman, the artist,
presided as chef in extraordinary.

Chief Hodgkins was barred from
swearing to complaints as were all
fÂ»thÂ»>r police officials who were con
nected with the Investigations which
causf-d the dismissal of th^ quartet.
Both Shannon and Goodwin explained
to Prosecuting Attorney A. P. Leach
and to Chief of Police Hodgkins that
th^y did not feel warranted in making
eworn accusations upon the evidence
at hand. The law requires that direct
charges must be made in cases of a
ftlony grade; that affidavits sworn to
"upon information and belief" are not
acceptable. Therefore neither police
man was willing to take the respon
sibility of making the charges.
So far as prosecution of any of the
dismissed policemen is concerned the
refusal of Shannon and Goodwin to
act pottles thÂ»- situation and closc-s the
li.cider.t. They were the only men who
taw any of the operations and were the
only men who came anywhere near
b^ing in a position to make the required
affidavits upon which warrants of ar
rest could issue.
Policeman Michael Shannon and
Special Policeman N. N. Goodwin to
day refused to swear to complaints
against former Sergeant of Police C. E.

erton on charges of burglary growing
out of the recent exposures of pilfering
in merchants' stores.

Former State Senator Frank J. Moffitt
Is critically ill at his residence. Filbert
and Eighteenth streets. His recovery is
extremely doubtful. He has been ill for
several months, but at intervals had re
cuperated and gained strength until a
recurrence of his trouble . prostrated
him ten days ago.
Since then the patient has been grad
ually sinking, and his condition became
so alarming to-day<that his physicians
say the case is almost hopeless.
Dr. S. H. Buteau, the family physi
cian, who has charge of the case, to
day summoned Dr. E. H. Woolsey of
this city and Dr. McConnell of San
Francisco in consultation. After a close
examination the physicians decided
that the administration of extreme
remedies to meet the low action of the
heart was necessary. Owing to Moffltt's
debilitated condition the doctors fear
that he has not sufficient vitality to
rally.
Moffltt has been one of the prominent
characters in the political life of Cali
fornia. His activity in affairs in this
city has given him a wide prominence,
both in politics, in Journalism and it
business. For many years he conducteu
the Oakland Times through the heat oi
hard-fought campaigns, in which the
blows given and taken were far from
being love taps. Senator Moffltt is mar
ried and has a son, Jefferson Moffltv.
There are several brothers and sisters

No one wants to tyrannize over you. or to
makÂ» this work galling or Irksome. All the
Government a.Â«ks in return for the $100,000 it
gives the university is that we maintain a mili
tary department. You have an able and honor
able officer In command of the department in
the person ot Captain Nance. He has rendered
this country valuable service In China and the
Philippines, and Is now stationed here to carry
cut the Government's plan. If you men obey
the regulations the work can be made pleasant
and will be productive of great gcod to all. Im
plicit and absolute obedience Is neceusary, how
ever. No military department can be maintained
without It. To be able to subject yourself
completely to properly constituted authority Is
a fine thing and should In no way be thoupht
to indicate subserviency on the part of these
who so obey the regulations.
Captain Nance, with his adjutants,
drilled the cadets as usual this morn
ing on the Ampus and the old football
field. Colonel Robert Moulthrop, who
has been instrumental in organizing
the military department of the univer
sity, assisted in the drill. After the
cadets had bÂ»en drawn up in hollow
square formation, Colonel Moulthrop
addressed the men as follows:
Mom* thiiiKS have ha5<pened recently that In
no vray have rofl<*'t"d credit on ycur university.
The b*st way for you to show
your rÂ»(tard . for your ccllrge Is to

you don't, the <Jovernment Inspector may
some day advise the department at Washing
ton that It Ire abolished, and this. In addition
to the disgrace, would mean a Ions of f KH.C0O
a year to the university, trte greater part cf
which Is utilized in other departments than the
military. - ' â¢
Hale was Informed by Captain Nance
to-day that a special report in his case
had been made by Professor W. A.
Setchell of the students' affairs com
mittee,. Setchell having reported, ac
cording to Hale, that the young editor's
conduct at the riot on the campus was
reprehensible.
Â¦ Some of the students have attempted
to excuse themselves to Captain Nance,
for failure to be present^at the recita
tion, when the original trouble oc
curred, by saying" that they simply cut
that recitation. J. L.. Dobbins, a senior,
to-day made this explanation to Nance
and was informed that it could not be
considered a sufP.cient excuse. This
point, it Is said, will be brought before
the academic senate
We are i>ermitted to make this appeal to the
senate, and In the event of our dismissal being
ordered we certainly Â»licll avail ourselves of
the privilege. If it Is domonstrated that Cap
tain Nance was not carrying out any specific
regulation of the War Department In directing
the i-la's to ilne up in front of North, Hall, but
merely was carrying out his idea of what con
stituted discipline, then the penate will be
competent to revise that order and decide upon
the wisdom and advisability of the order.
In the cases 'of Individual studonto. who may
feel thai they have bi'Â«-n treated unfairly, and
hav>Â» not hod the hearing befc re Captain Nance
to which they are entitled, the senate will be
asked to consider the facts, from the students'
standpoint, and decide whether they have been
unfairly condemned.
Despite the fact that Captain J. T.
Nance, military instructor at the Uni
versity, to-day delivered his report to
President Wheeler in, the cases of for
ty-eight of the sixty-three seniors who
were charged with insubordination and
riotous conduct, the suspense of the ac
cused men continues. They still are
Ignorant of their fate. They do not
know whether Nance has recommended
their dismissal, or whether he has de
cided to accept the excuses made to
him as satisfactroy. President Wheel
er refuses to state what Captin Nance
has reported. Captain Nance refers
all questioners to the president. The
President has nothing to say.
'"I cannot be interviewed again on
this matter." said President Wheeler
this afternoon. "All in good time,
whatever is done, will be known."
W. T. Hale, editor of the Daily Cali
fornian, a college publication, who was
called before the students* affairs com
mittee of the faculty last week to.ex
plain hia editorials, which were strenu
ously objected to by the commitee, said
to-day that the controversy of the
seniors with Captain Nance will be
taken eventually to the academic
senate, a body composed of the . pro
fessors and Instructors of the univer
sity, who will be asked to rule upon the
Justness of the military Instructor's ac
tion, if that action results in the dis
missal of seniors from the military
class, and go from the university. Said

The company has also agreed to in
stall a distributing system to cost ap
proximately $1,500,000. making- the
totnl cost of the plant $5,250,000.
In view of the committee's recom
mendation it' Is assured that the City
Council will submit this proposition
to a vote of the people at a bond elec
tion to be called as soon as legal re
quirements can be met.
The canvass of the citizens, which
was ended to-day, gave a total vote
of 7122, or within 4 00 of the total
vote that was cast at the recent bond
election for ' public improvements.
The cards returned showed pref
erences a3 follows:
Five thousand and fifty-four are for the Bay
Titles Wnter Company's projiosltion, 154T. are
for the wells supply. Â«."V are for either. 360 are
against both propositions, 92 were rejected, of
which 52 were not signed. 22 expressed no
opinion "nnd 18 for miscellaneous reasons.
Of the :$r>fj votes against both propositions.
57 expressed a preference for the Contra
Costa Water Company's plant. 23 were against
municipal ownership on principle. 23 miscel
laneous reasons were given, and 263 gave no
reason.
OAKLAXD. Nov. 21.â The Bay
Cities Water Company's proposal to
establish a municipal water supply for
the city of Oakland has been recom
mended to the City Council for adop
tion by unanimous vote of the special
committee on water supply. This ac
tion is the result of the canvass made
by the committee, which returned a
vote of 5054 for the Bay Cities
project as against 1545 for the arte
sian' wells plan. The report of the
committee was made to-night to the
City Council and it was referred to the
committee of the whole, which will
meet Friday night. â¢
On motion of Councilman B. H.
Pendleton the City Attorney was di
rected to consult with the attorneys
of the Bay Cities Water Company with
relation to the preparation of a con
tract of construction of the plant.
Under the terms of the company's
proposition a plant will be installed
to bring not less than 20,000,000 gal
lons daily to the southern boundary of
the city. This is to cost $3,750,000.
COMPANY'S AGREEMENTS.
Embodied in the recommendation
is the statement sent . to the voters,
which presented the arguments on
the Bay Cities Water Company and
the artesian wells scheme.
The report to the Council is signed
by the entire committee, which is
composed of Warren Olney. J. T._Wal
lace. Edwin Meese, F. C. Turner. R.
H. Chamberlain, Cary Howard and
James K. Moffitt.
In its recommendations to the
Council the committee said:
' Of the various propositions brought to our
attention, the committee, having unanimous^
asreed updn two as possessing the Â«reat?si
merit and being the most feasible for adop
tion, was also of the opinion that an expres
sion of preference on the part of our citizen.
after setting forth before them the salient
features of each of these, would be of great
assistance to the Council in deciding as to
the project which should b* presented to the
peoplÂ» in a bond election. We therefore issued
a circular letter, which Is attached hereto, and
a ropy thereof was mailed on November 14 to
every registered voter of the city. Â»e tamK
the above letter sufficiently set forth the re
sults of our investigation, except that we
Bhould cow add that the committee has had to
eliminate all propositions presented to It for
bringing water from the Sierra Nevada Moun
tains, because in each case th* expense would
be greater than thÂ» city can now tegaJly In
cur, and it does not seem practically possible
at the present time to unite Berkeley and
Alameda with us In such a plan. - :
SOME CONCLUSIONS.
The committee embodies the result
of the canvass and continues:
In view of the fact that at the recent bond
election held September 'Si. when ten different
propositions for public improvement were sub
mitted to vote, a total of 7563 voles were cast,
and that at the election held April 23, 19O*. for
the Issuance of *96<Â»,C0O of school bonds, only
3905 vote* were cast, we feel that the abovj
response, over the signatures of the voters. Is
Indicative of a deep Interest on. 'the part of
our citizens In this Important question of mu
nicipal policy.
While there was at first a difference of
opinion in the committee as to which of these
two propositions we should recommend, wo
are now unanimous In recommending the Bay
Cltlfs Water Company's proposition. Our cit
izens have exprp^ed their choice In so posi
tive a manner' we believe that all reimlne
friends of municipal ownership of water sup
ply, regardless of iormer preference as among
various pÂ«->5sible plans for its accomplishment,
shruld now heartily unite in support of this
proposition which finds favor with such a
large majority of voters who have thus
spoken.

man's desiring to pay off a note and

the suit filed yesterday by Albert W.
Levy against Pauline and Robert Gor
dan and Edward Calame. Levy bor
rowed $750 from Calame in 1901 and
as security assigned his interest in the
estate of his father, Henry, Levy. The
amount of principal and' Interest la
now $982 50. which Levy wants to pay.
but Calame has transferred the note to
the Gordans, who refuse to surrender It.
There may be something back of the
matter, as Mrs. Gordan was the sec
ond wife of Henry Levy and contested
his will because she waa not left
enough of the estate. Levy asks the
court to compel acceptance of the
money and to declare the assignment
of his Interest void.

made by counsel for E. S. Ellla. deputy Street
Superintendent, to set aside the indlctmenta
found by the Grand Jury charxinjr him with
accepting bribes on street work and set thÂ«
case fo r trial December 13.
With a deep holt in his forehead and
a pistol clutched firmly in hi? right
hsnd the body of Charles N. Cooper,
a Stanford student, was found near
;he prayer book cross in Golden Gate
1'ark early yesterday morning.' The
fnsition of the body and the nature
of the wound showed that it was a
case of suicide.
Not a scrap of writing that would
give any hint as to why the student
was wpary of existence was found on
the body. In a. pocket was a wallet
containing letters of Introduction to
several people in this city and a check
book on an Aurora, 111-, bank showing
that Cooper still had on deposit $104.
CharJps Cooper was scarcely past
twenty years of age, a capable and
industrious student. He left his home
in Aurora, 111., last August and ma
triculated at the Stanford University.
He joined the ranks of the determined
young seekers after knowledge who
support themselves as they study.
This task was easy for Cooper, for he
was a competent stenographer. Men
oi his profession were much in demand
tround the university.
M. Woods, a former student of the
university and a resident of Palo Alto,
knew the young student In Illinois. He
called at the Morgue yesterday when
he heard of the tragedy. Woods said
that he could think of no motive for
the deed.
"Early in the spring," said Woods,
"Cooper wrote to me asking what the
chances were for a young fellow to
work his way through Stanford. I told
him that they were good, so he came
out and registered. He visited my peo
ple and myself frequently at Palo
Alt<V and seemed an earnest student
and a pleasant young fellow."
Mr. Woods further said:
His habits, co far as I know, were grood.
In fact. I think hÂ«- was too close a student
and too hard n worker if anything. I know
Of n-> love affair, either in the East or here.
Still h* was not an unsociable boy. On the

11* v.a* not morbid. Ho seemed perfectly nor
mal ar.<3 was always LlWCifuL I can think of
nn reason for his suicide unless it was tem-
I-orary Insanity rauyed by overstudy and over
work. H>? was not la financial straits. I told
him that If he wjls ever temporarily embar
rassed to ccme to me.
Cooper left Palo Alto Saturday
morning. On Saturday evening he at
tended the Majestic Theater. On Sun
day night he went to the Chutes and
afterward walked into the park. Near
the prayer-book cross he halted, and,
pressing a revolver tightly against his
temple, pulled the trigger. So firm
was his clutch upon the weapon that
Coroner's Deputy Brown had some dif
ficulty in removing it from the stiffened
hand-
Cooper had letters of introduction to
the following people: Richard S. Al
len, 211 Drumm street; Miss Ethel Al
len, T. M. Galvin cf the Eby Machinery
Company and Mrs. Bettie Adams of
Berkeley, He had presented none of
the letters. Woods says the father of
young Cooper Is a train dispatcher at
Aurora. 111., though a card in the dead
boy's pocket reads: "Cooper & Son, In
surance Agents." Indicating that father
and son had been in that business to
gether. One of the most pathetic arti
cles in the boy's possession was a check
showing that he was one of the Joyful
Stanford rooters at the football game.

Miss Grace Dillon, a very pretty gir:
wearing a dainty cowboy hat, insisted
that she never gave Robert Fisher, red
haired and spectacled, encouragement
sufficient to warrant the attentions
which he persistently thrust upon her.
It was his wont, she averred, to visii
291 Page street, where she resided with
her mother, and to ignore the snubs re
peatedly administered to him by the
landlady as per instruction from the
complainant. She did not desire
that he be sent to Jail If he could be
induced bv less drastic means to cease
pestering her life out. Once upon a
time she had been on speaking terms
with him, but at no time indlc&ted that
his tender attachment would be recip
rocated.
Mr. Fisher, In response to Judge Mo
gan's query as to why he did It, de
clared that his onlv object In visiting
291 Page street was to obtain one tooth
brush, his personal property, which he
had left there when Miss Dillon regard
ed him more kindly. He was a clerk,
but sickness incapacitated him for la
bor, and he was certain that It was not
love-sickness.
"Humph." said Miss Dillon, "if a
tooth brush will keep him away I'll
see that he pets one."
On that basis the case was dismissed.
George Wilson, against whom three

Nicolas Aspica, who stabbed Bessie

After solemnly pronouncing the pre
scribed formula of marriage," with Wil
liam T. Canham, bachelor, and May
Agnes Tibballs, spinster, as the con
tracting parties, Police Judge Cabaniss
was cast Into embarrassment by the
discovery that the surname of the male
principal on the wedding license was
incorrectly spelled, the clerk having
written "n" instead of "m" as the ter
minal letter. The young woman's at
torney proposed that his Honor attach
an extra tail to the "n" and then re
peat the ceremony, but the young
man's attorney questioned the legality
of such a proceeding, and the young
man himself said that he was already
in enough trouble without having it
augmented by his arrest fc-r bigamy
or something of that sort. So the Judge
and the two lawyers exhaustively dis
cussed the question of whether the
union just effected would be legally
cohesive if either party to It should
desire to break away without enlisting
the aid of the divc-rce court, the two
limbs of the law agreeing that the
statutes did not authorize more than
one marriage of one couple in one day,
also that if the ceremony already per
formed were allowed to stand the wife
must in law and fact be addressed as
Mrs. Canhan instead of by her hus
band's name c-f Canham; likewise, that
a cloud would forever rest upon a mar
riage by which the woman was not
presented with the man's proper cog
nomen. The longer the argument pro
gressed the deeper the muddle became,
until the Judge happily found a way
out by having the groom sign a pledge,
written on the back of the license, that
he would regard himself as the wo
man's husband irrespective of the opin
ion of either law or laity.
In no other respect was the wedding
eventful. The bride, a tall and hand
some young person, attired in brown
broadcloth and hat, was supported by
her mother, and the groom's shirt was
collarless. The happy couple did not
even glance at each other from the
time they entered the Judge's chambers
until they departed. He is a special
police ofticer and was arrested and
charged with betraying the girl under
promise of marriage. She continues
to dwell with her month-old babe at
the residence of her maternal relative,
379 Eleventh street. During the cere
mony he smoked a brown paper cigar
ette, but considerately adopted the
Judge's suggestion that he remove It
while speaking the responses, as it in
terfered with his articulation. When
asked if he took the woman to be his
lawfully wedded wife he said he was
under arrest and forced to do so,
whereupon his mother-in-law-elect fix
upon his countenance a dark and pierc
ing eye and kept it riveted there until
he was made a benedict. Then the
bride and her mother bowed to their
lawyer and retired, and a few mo
ments later the grown and his lawyer
departed.
The hearing of the betrayal charge is
set for to-morrow, but yesterday's pro
ceedings undoubtedly quashed the com
plaint.
Suspecting that his wife, from whom
he lived apart, was trifling with her
altar vows, L.. H. Guion armed himself
with a revolver of wide bore last Sun
day evening and mounted the roof of
the house on Adelaide place in which
she resided. A skylight gave him a
blrdseye view of her bedroom, and
while peering Into the dark interior he
I overbalanced and crashed through the
I glass to the floor beneath, his weapon
exploding as he fell. There were femi
nine screams and a scuttling sound, fol
lowed by a hurried opening, shutting
and locking- of the chamber door. Mr.
Guion, damaged hardly at all by his
drop, scrambled to his feet and struck
a matchâ to find his wife sitting up in
I bed and very much frightened. A mo
ment later Patrolman Lycett, whose at-
I tentlon had. been attracted by the pistol
shot, the breaking glass and the wom
an's screeches, put in an appearance
and arrested Guion for discharging fire
arms within the city limits. Among the
trophies carried away by the prisoner
was a complete set of masculine outer
garments with the exception of a hat
and one shoe. As the clothing was
much too spacious for the defendant
Judge Fritz dismissed the case and
suggested divorce as a substitute for
roof-climbing \ and pistol-carryingâ a
suggestion which was received with evi
dent favor.

three blocks ere he captured him.- For
tunately for Cameron, the woman, who
dwells at 902 Oak street, was not badly
hurt and seemed disinclined to prose
cute him. Judge Cabaniss, however, in
'â¢ dismissing the case expressed wonder

THE PRESS OF THE NATION.
Editor The Callâ I notice in your is
sue of the 16th the account of. Governor
Pardee's speech at the Irrigation Con
gress at El Paso, wherein the Governor
Is quoted as saying "Fresno County Is
the largest raisin center in the United
States, sending out in 1903 over 600
carloads of raisins and over 1000 car
loads of fruits of all kinds."
It is to be regretted that there is an
error in some way connected with this
quotation, and I am Inclined to believe
that the same Is due to a mistake in
telegraphlo communication. Governor
Pardee is thoroughly conversant with
the resources of this State, and I have
no Idea that he made any such state
ment at the Irrigation Congress. There
Is no doubt in anybody's mind % that the
first clauseâ to the effect that Fresno
County is the largest shipping raisin
center In the United States â Is true,
since this county produces at least 75
per cent ot all the raisins produced In
the State of California, and California
produces the bulk of the raisins grown
in the 'United States.
Our raisin exnort for 1903 was be
tween 5000 and 6000 cars, instead of 600,
as given In this -account. These raisins
were shipped to all parts of the world,
and I will add that the production of
1904 had it not been for early rains
would have been Just aa large. Seventy
million pounds In round numbers is a
conservative estimate for the produc
tion of raisins for this county annu
ally.
This year some unpleasant conditions
obtained with relation to prices, but
this is not due, as many contend, to
overproduction, but to the mere fact
that these goods are not widely adver
tised. Were we California^ to use the
same diligence as the breakfast food
companies practice there is little doubt
that there would be a greater, demand
for more raisins in the rai3in belt and
prunes in the prune district than these
districts could supply if they raised ten
times their present production.
I would thank you to correct the
statement with reference to Governor
Pardee's speech if you see fit to do so,
and knowing your interest in the wel
fare of this glorious State I feel as
sured that you will lend every assist
ance to further her advancement.

HOME COOKERY
The purpose of the free market is to bring the producer and the
buyer face to face, and make of every consignment a cash transac
tion. When the market is free to all sellers and to all buyers the
natural price as fixed by supply and demand will prevail and the
producers will only have themselves to blame if they do not go home
every day with the cash price of their produce in their pockets./
It is the expectation of the State Board of Trade that when this
system is made permanent by being permanently installed on the
new seawall the vending of country produce to the city consumer
will become here what it is in'every large city of the country, where
such a free market is taken as a matter of 'course, because it has
been so long in existence. It will secure stability of supply and of
prices. It will prevent artificial scarcity, which frequently occurs
after the producer has parted with his property, causing a rise in
price which gives him no benefit. It will also, by stability of sup
ply, increase consumption, and when the erratic fluctuation in prices
is prevented it will be the means of yielding the producer a better
average return on his season's crops than he can hope for now. It
will also place the consumer in reach of what he desires every day
and not compel him to do without part of the time because of high
price or disappearance of supply.
The Board of Trade has entered into negotiations with the Har
bor Commission to secure reservation of the space required, and
seems to have reached, by its action, a solution of the matter that
will be very satisfactory to the producers of the State, who in voting
for the seawall prove to have been voting to themselves a prize
that has heretofore seemed to be beyond their reach.
AT its last session the State Board of Trade prepared a free
market campaign by proposing that when the seawall exten
sion is made proper space be reserved therein for such a mar
ket. The present water front space is so crowded that the free
market cannot be made as effective as the Legislature intended and
the producers of the State desire. The seawall extension will make
a very large addition to the space available, anl the State Board of
Trade shows its alert attention to the needs of the State by the
timely action it has taken.

"true" that the question arises, can
true love die?
It would be hard to find a lover who
would be willing to . concede that tha
love which actuated him might possibly
bo not true love at all. but a cheaper
substitute. A lover's emotion seems a
very real thing to its possessor. At tha
time It appears to him to ba all thera

Itself. But one day, maybe, ha wakes
to find that for some reason, either
tangible or unintelligible, his love has

ha begins to doubt tha trustworthiness
of tha universal passion.

Yet the fact remains that we do see
now and then Instances of a love which
lives as long as the one whom It In
spires. Such a love Is best exemplified
in married life. Tha secret heart of
single blessedness Is closely hidden
from either curious or sympathetic
eyes. It Is no argument tor constancy
that a man or woman does not marry
because of disappointment In love; tht?
may mean true love, or it may be due
to complete disillusionment. What Jean
Paul Rlchter said Is generally applic
able: "Lova without marriage Is Ilka
a bird of passage who seats himself
upon a mast which Itself moves along."
There -really does exist, I fully be

phrase mean, anyway? Is It
a catch-word, caught up out of the
dream of a poet who lived when the
world was young, and repeated ever
afterward for the sake of effect? Or
is it an entity, one of life's great won
ders?
"What love is wo do not know;
whence it comes, or whither it goes we
know not," the wise men say. The
problem has puzzled philosopher* and
moralists for ages. 7}n the one hand
the poets, and on the other the scien
tists, have taxed their ingenuity to dis
cover and define its essence.
Doctors have pronounced it a mal
ady of the mind, which, like other
forms of mental disease, impairs the
body's health. A couple of years ago
a Chicago physician jtried to explain
it by using medical Jargon of the day
and calling it "a microbe."
Yet, after all is Bald upon the sub
ject which man is capable of paying,
where have we arrived? We stand
where stood others, wiser than we to
begin with, who declared: "What love
is we do not know; whence it comes or
whither it sroes we know not."
But one truth at least Is yours and
mine to graspâ 'tis only those that do
not love who ask what love is; the rest
simply love and are satisfied.
Paradoxical as It seems, it is easier
to form an opinion of what true lova
is than it Is to comprehend the char
acter of love itself. The quality of
truth which la Involved gives one a
foothold; at once we have reality to
deal with.
To most of us, however, there is more
than mere reality Implied. The phrase
"true love" carries with it an Idea of
permanency, in the lense of an un
alterable devotion toward a single ob
ject, and it is out of this confusion in
regard to the significance of the word
DOES true love ever die? This
question ha* Just been pro
pounded to me by a reader of
these columns.

one link In common. His parents knew
him as James Carruthers. His clients
and professional friends called him Jim
the Counselor. Miss Langham knew
him as her oldest â and, he hoped, her
bestâ friend. Elizabeth Langham knew
him as her employer.
Elizabeth Langham often wondered
that Jim had selected her from two
dozen applicants for the position of
stenographer in his legal establish
ment. A callow graduate from a busi
ness college, she had hardly hoped to
gain acceptance over a score of ex
perienced typists. The true reason â
her name â she /*hever guessed. Still
Jim had no reason to regret his choice.
Miss Elizabeth was neat, pretty and
bright. Jim dictated to her daily and
she transcribed without an error.
Not so Miss Langham, the focus of
fifty bachelor aspirations* Jim tried
dictation there only once/
"Mr. Caruthers," said Miss Lang
ham coldly, "you are taking a mean
advantage of our friendship. You
have no right to criticize my other
friends. I am proud-to number Judge
Newton among my friends."
"But he's fifty if he's a day," Jim
persisted.
"So shall you be, Mr. Carruthers â
some day. Good night."
There were tears after Jim had taken
his departure, but that Jim did not
know. He did know, however, that
Miss Langham had dismissed him and
he sorrowed accordingly.
"It's that fellow, Colonel Newton,"
he mused. "Since they've elected him
a Judge Elizabeth has been Indifferent
to me. Mrs. Judge Newton evidently
sounds better to her young ears than
plain Mrs. Jimmy Carruthers." So he
floundered homeward in the slush of a
winter evening and nursed his first
great sorrow.
Sorrow maketh a sympathizer. Jim
my, blue and hopeless, became human
itarian in a week. One morning when
his stenographer. Miss Elizabeth,
showed him a court summons which
had been served upon her, demanding
that she pay the sum of $250 forthwith
or suffer the entry of a judgment for
that amount, Jimmy simply radiated
consolation. "Who is this Mme. Nellie
who is suing you?"
"I never heard of her," was the re
sponse.
Jim scanned the papers closely. "Ma
dame Nellie," he said after he had fin
ished, "seems to be the trade name of
a being whose Christian apellation is
Michael O'Malley. He says you or
dered one blue dress of the value of
$250. He swears that you have re
fused to accept it and he sues accord
ingly."
"There must be some mistake. I
never ordered a dress one- fourth as
expensive as that. Nor have I ever
laid eyes on Madame Nellie."
"Where do you live?" he inquired.
Her reply astonished him. "Num
ber â â Sixth avenue."
"Is that near Fifty-seventh street V
"It Is en the corner. The side street
is very fashionable. This summons
most be Intended for some wealthy
woman near by who doesn't pay her
bills."
When Jim saw that the papers were
signed in tha name of the Hon. Wil
liam Newton, Justice, his mind was
made up. He told his secretary to have
no fear. He was happy to show his
appreciation of her faithful and long
continued service.
He tried the case himself. His rival
eat on his bench and glared savagely
at him â at least that is "Jimmy's re
port of the judicial attitude.
As it happened, Madame Nellie was
not present in the courtroom, having
been detained elsewhere on jury duty.
In his place he sent two of his as
sistants. One of< them took the stand
at once â a florid faced lady she was,
who confessed amiably that she had
been a dressmaker for twenty-one
years and was approaching her thir
tieth birthday. "It's this way, Judge,
yer Honor," she testified glibly,
"Madame Nellie sent the dress and
she sent it back, saying it didn't fit.
I didn't have nothing to do with it,
but the lady in our house as did has
assured me that it fitted to perfection.
Madame Nellie says Miss' Langham
should be compelled to pay."
At this point Jim felt called upon to
explain matters. â¢ "You see." he start
ed to say, "they've got the wrongâ "
Judge Newton waved him aside. "The
issue in this case is* simple. Does the
gown fit? That is all. I would like to
ask Miss Langham a question or two.
Take the stand. Miss."
Miss* Langham did so.
"What is your name?"
"Elizabeth Langham."
"Where do you live?"
"No. -r- â Sixth avenue."
"You may retire to my private
chambers and don the dress. The
plaintiff's experts will, accompany
you."
Miss Langham commenced to .weep.
"I should call that an amazing
ly good fit," said Judge Xewton.

UP to the beginning of our present navy by Secretary Whitney,
that arm of the service had been the weakest among the
first-class nations. In the first administration of President
Cleveland it was determined that our seacoast line, longer than
:hat of any other county, and the importance of our many seaports
and the wealth accumulated in them, made it necessary to have a
navy adequate to the defense of so much coast and of such important
interests. The work of building a navy began then and has gone
forward with but little interruption, until we have the third navy
in the world, with France next above us, and Great Britain at the
head. f
Since Whitney's day we have had many impressive lessons.
The war between japan and China was a demonstration of the need
and utility of sea power. When our Spanish war was looming above
the horizon there were grave doubts that we could cope with the
navy of our adversary. On paper it excelled us in many essential
features. Our whole Atlantic seacoast was in fear. It is not for
gotten that in Rosion, especially, there was distress that rose to a
panic, caused by the long time that elapsed between the sailing of
Spain's Allantic'rket and news of its position. In the event it proved
that we outclassed Spain, not in our naval tonnage and guns so
much as in the efficiency of our service, but prudent men then re
flected upon what might have happened if we had challenged a first
class sea power.
The present war between Japan arid Russia is a current com
ment upon the need of sea power- as the first element in the defense
of a maritime nation. The Japanese statesmen looked far ahead and
secured not only a navy but the training and skill needed to make
it effective. The result has been that her more bulky adversary has
lost in every encounter on the water, and has been driven to de
stroy or disarm her own ships to prevent their capture or destruc
tion by the alert Japanese.
The time has come to reinforce the skill of our navy officers and
men by ships in number, tonnage and armament equal to the best
owned by any other nation. This is not a war but a peace measure.
As we have often explained, the two nations whose combined navies
exceed the combined sea power of the rest of the world can com
mand the peace of the planet. It\is not beyond the grasp of the
advocates of national economy that it is cheaper to spend $100,000,
000 a year on a navy that compels peace than it is to spend $1,000,
000.000 a year in war, as we did in our civil struggle.
An educated Brahmin, one of the great thinkers of India, in
a public address in this city a few years ago, said that the Hindoos
had not cultivated the offensive and defensive arts because they
believed that making no preparations for war themselves no one
would make war upon them. This did impress Alexander, who-, with
his Greeks, penetrated to the Ganges and then concluded that a
country not considered by its people worth defending was not worth
taking. But it did not impress his successors, the Mongol conquer
ors and Lord Clive. So the Brahmin declared that the Indian policy
of non-resistance proved to be a mistake, f6r they have lived under
foreign masters for ages.
It may be accepted as a fact that until arbitration is firmly estab
lished and the strong nations accept its results against them and in
favor of weak nations the lion and the lamb will sleep together only
when the lamb is inside his bedfellow. Considering our advanced
place among the nations, there is probably no peace measure in
sight, no argument for it is as powerful, as an American navy that
can defend our coasts and in a defensive war defy the world. Our
naval programme has been deprecated in Government circles in
continental Europe, but we notice that our critics have not closed
any shipyards nor reduced their fleets.
If the policy of Secretary Morton is carried out, our long sea
ccast will be efficiently defended and our navy will command the
respect of the world. The situation is made plain by the fact that not
until two years hence will we be able to put into action twelve
battleships, eight armored cruisers, twenty-one protected cruisers,
sixteen torpedo-boat destroyers and thirty-five torpedo-boats, a total
of ninety-two ships of all classes. Take down the map and measure
our thousands of miles of seacoast and fancy the small number of
our fighting ships told off into squadrons and separated for its de
fense, and one must wonder that we have so long been inattentive
to the need of augmenting our sea power. We have been nearly
as sentimental as the Hindoos, and it is quite time io be more
practical.
THERE were two Elizabeth Lang
hams. For fifteen years they had
lived almost side by side and
neither of them had learned of
the other's existence. Three
hundred feet 'of metropolitan
space and several hundred thousand
: dollars separated them socially and
: completely. The elder Miss Langham
resided near the middle of the block in
a plutocratic white stone mansion. At
the corner of the same street in a mod
est flat house lived the other Elizabeth.
Though neither of them was aware
of the circumstance these two possessed

"If you please, Judge Newton," she
stammered.
"Do as I say," he responded testily.
"The court will Judge for itself."
Five minutes later Miss Langham
re-entered the courtroom clad in the
gown under dispute. Madame Nellie's
expert beamed with satisfaction as she
addressed the court. "You can see
for yourself, Judge, yer Honor. It fits
without a wrinkle."
"I should call that an amazingly
good fit," said Judge Newton, frown
ing, adding by the way of Judicial con
cession, "and mightily becoming. It
fits, doesn't it?"
"Y-e-s." said Miss Langham,
"but "
"That's all. Judgment for Madame
Nellie for the full amount."
Once more Jim rose from his chair.
"Won't you permit me to say a few
words?. There has been a mistake."
"There has not, Mr. Carruthers; un
less it be your own in endeavoring to
defend a case in which the evidence is
so palpably, in favor of the other side."
On the way back to the office Jim
consoled his client. He promised to
appeal the case to the highest court
in the country.
In his heart he knew that the case
of Madame Nellie vs. Miss Elizabeth
Langham would never be heard in
court again.

When Miss Elizabeth Langham
emerged from her coupe at 6 o'clock
that evening she found her household
in an uproar. Mathilde, her maid, was
almost breathless. "If you please,
ma'am," she gasped, "there's a man in
,the parlor â a Sheriff or something,
and he's been holding the best peach
blow vase these two hours. I sent for
the police. The police says he can't
do nothing. He told the man to wait.
There he Is now, ma'am, sitting in the
best gilt chair, with the vase In his
hand, ma'am."
The Intruder advanced as Miss
Langham entered the parlor. Yes, he
was a deputy. There was a Judgment
against Elizabeth Langham in favor
of Madame Nellie. Didn't she remem
ber the dress she ordered from Mad
ame Nellie? *
"But I sent it back. It did not fit."
"Of course," said he suavely, "that
may have been the defense. A' Judg
ment is a judgment, however. Will
you pay up or shall I make a levy?"
he adding, casting longing glances at
the vase.
"This shall not. go unpunished. It
is an outrage," said Miss Langham
indignantly. "Wait until I ring up my
friend, Judge Newton."
"Your friend?" The deputy laughed.
"You will receive instructions from
him." '
"I hkve received 'em already. It was
Judge (Newton that entered the Judg
ment against you. Here are the pa
pers. This is his own writing.",
One glance satisfied Miss Langham.
She bade Mathilde bring her check
book. "I'll pay," she said. "In the
meantime vou may. release that vase.
It Is hardly a tea store souvenir."

That same evening James Carruthers
sat in his den, ' reading Dante's
"Inferno." He had finished "The Sor
rows of Werther" the dav before. At
his elbow, still to be perused, lav "The
Joy of Living."
The telephone bell Jangled twice, but
he did not hear. At the third call he
rose from his chair. A moment later
the volume went speeding on its way
across the room.
, This is Jim's end of the conversation
that followed.
"Represent vou in the matter? Glad

oh, my! Newton? Beastly impudence!
Called to-nicht after all that hap
pened? You treated him rightly. Yes,

The next morning Jim informed his
stenographer gleefully that the Mad
ame Nellie matter was settled out of.
court, and that she might retain tha
dress as a silt. Later he called upon
the deputy sheriff.
"I am sorry, counselor," said the of
ficial, "that duty compelled me to go
against your client. Funny thing how
we collected it. I found the defendant
resided at No. Sixth avenue. I
saw it in the court record; she said so.
Those are flats and, says I. that judg
ment ain't no good. Afterward some
one rings this office up and tells me
the defendant didn't live there at all.
Says she was a swell and lived around
the corner on Fifty-seventh street. He
was right, too. She paid up like a
lamb. I wonder who it was that tipped

Â¦ Woods' side of the story Is told in
an answer to the suit; He admits that
he has the shares, that they are worth
$12,000 and that he is willing to de
posit them and $210 in dividends re
ceived with the court until the Ques
tion, of ownership is settled.
The defendant denies all the charges
of fraud and improper influence, and
explains the transaction as follows:
Mrs. Rosenthal was a professional
nurse, and for fifteen years was en
gaged in the families of Woods and
his wife. They always had a great af
fection for her, were kind to her, and,
believing that she was wholly with
out means, permitted her to stay for.
weeks at a time at their home without
cost In Jilne of this year she was af
flicted with paralysis, and, eaya the
answer, informed Woods' wife that
she had some stock which she wished
to give to Woods. She requested him
to call upon her, which he did at the
lodgings which she had occupied for
twenty years. She informed him, he
says, of her ownership of the stock,
and said that she had no heirs or rela
tives to whom she might leave It by
will. She feared it might be stolen Jf
she wa3 seriously ill, and, as she was
greatly attached to the Woods fam
ily, she desired to give it to him ab
solutely upon the one condition that
he should not dispose of it during her
lifetime, but should collect the divi
dends and apply them to her support
Woods says that he did not accept
at that time, but in a few days called
again. She told him her health was
failing and she was afraid she would
lose the shares or be deprived of them.
He decided to accept the gift, and she
then duly Indorsed the certificates and
handed them to him. On July 21, he
says, in order that no question would
arise in the future, he took Notary
James Mason to the house, and a for
mal transfer was drawn up and sign
ed. He declares that at-that time Mrs.
Rosenthal was in full possession of her
mental faculties.
The defendant says that at
the same time she gave him
a check for $192 78. with which
to pay some small bills. He now has
$210 86 in dividends. He says he tried
to induce her to leave her lodgings and
go to the King's Daughters' Home, but
she refused to go. Wilson & Wilson
are his attorneys.
A few weeks ngo' EmIUe A. Dierks,
as guardian of Wilhelmlna Rosenthal,
an aged paralytic, j sued Robert J.
Woods to recover an unknown num
ber of Spring Valley Water Company
shares, which, she said, had been ob
tained from the old lady by fraud. It
was charged that Woods had taken
advantage of Mrs. Rosenthal's weak
mental condition to influence her to
transfer the stock to him and that he
induced her to sign a paper, the con
tents of which she did not compre
hend.
As Georgiana Miss Elliott is resrally
lovely. It is not quite fair to besrin with
this, but one is helpless before the El-
Ilott beauty. And one may take Miss
Elliott' as seriously as she deserves as
an . actress. Perhaps ttfe womanly
sweetness of the character is its stronc
est phase, but Miss Elliott suggests the
strength, the lovable willfulness, the co
quetry, the nobility of the girl, with
equally happy and facile art. Depth
greater than she has touched before
she reaches here, and the lighter phase
is more lightly given, and altogether
Miss Elliott shows notable and distin
guished advance in her art. The sud
porting company Is good. Among the
other women Fannie Addlson Pitt, as
the woman in an Adellna Patti auburn
wig. Is very amusing; Georgle Law
rence, as the hairdresser, overdraws,
but entertainingly Is a very clever
character, and Nellie Thome realizes
well the Mrs. Carley.
James Carew is the Sam Coast, and
though fairly convincing is not so ef
fective as the part gives opportunity
for. Charles Cherry does all that Is
needed in manly fashion for the soldier
lover, and R. C. Herz enacts with
some skill the part of the speculating
brother. Scenically the production , is
of notable handsomeness. /
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Maxine Elliott made her first local
appearance aa a star last night at the
Columbia, and, aa in her play, had all
"her own way" with ub. Miss Elliott
brings a Clyde Fitch comedy, "Her
Own Way," made for her last year by
the Indefatigable playwright It is ex
cellently tailored. The leading role fits
Miss Elliott to a nicety, and it is sur
rounded by torn* of Mr. "Fitch's more
smartly drawn figures. Of these, two
are new in the Fitch gallery, the villain
âhe is almost Kremer-likeâ and the
hairdressing lady, who, perhaps, would
have come more newly before the
Sophy Fullgarney, in "The Gay Lord
Quex." There are also the familiar
flighty society grandmamma, the
"climbing" daughter, the weak and
sanguine speculator, a soldier hero, the
smart servants, and for novelty again,
the babies of the smart set. These, with
Miss Elliott as a charmingly willful,
womanly, altogether winsome lady, act
out the story, pretty, engaging, amus
ing, entirely in the conventional man
ner.
Very deftly Mr. Fitch lets one into
the standing and secrets of the Carley
household. The first actâ and this is
the usual Fitch noveltyâ takes place
in a children's nursery. Four tiny fash
ionables are holding a birthday ban
quet, with three large servants in wait
ing. Enfants terrible they are, acquaint
ed with everything above and below
stairs; and between haughty com
mands for more icecream they let one
know that Sam Coast (the villain) is
"stuck on" auntie (Miss Elliott), but
that auntie likes Mr. Coleman (Charles
Cherry) and various other facts of In
terest. Then comes auntie to share the
fun. I shouldn't like to have missed
Maxine Elliott's graceful swood under
the table in the hide and go seek game,
to speak of nothing else. All through
the scene, a charming picture to begin
with, is notably attractive.
The act leaves the soldier lover
telling Miss Carley that he is about
to go to the Philippines. The second
act ends with his good-by, without de
claring himself, as the bad man has
told him that Georgiana was going to
marry him. To compass this Sam
Coast decides to ruin the Carley's,
Georgiana's brother Steve, his wife,
the mother. This he purposes to do
through Steve's weakness for specu
lation. Steve has gambled away his
own, his wife's, his mother-in-law's
money. Georgiana saves the day with
her own fortune. Coast tempts the
brother to speculate again. He does,
and the third act finds the sister's for
tune also gone. After his little habit
Coast again asks Georgiana to marry
him. She tells him that money can't
buy everything. He says his money
can. Then word comes of Coleman's
death in an ambuscade. However,
how it all ends happily is quite worth
while finding out and Mr. Fitch brings
some peculiarly clever dialogue to the
telling.
Lillian Lawrence, Btella Raieto, Luke
Conness and the other members of the
company do the best they can with
the material at their command.

Cure the
Drink Habit
The strong points of my cure are:
(i) I cure.
(a) I cure without detention from
business.
(3) I cure without the use of harm-
ful drugs.
(4) I cure without the use of dan-
gerous hypodermics.
(5) I cure without any bad after
effects.
In fifteen years, I have cured over
15,000 men without a single failure.
My life work has been the cure of the
drink habit and I claim to know more
about this subject than any other man
in' the world. I never publish testimo-
nials unless given' permission, but I
can refer you to thousands who have
been cured and who will gladly tell
you their experiences if it will help
you to take the cure and restore you
to health and happiness. Call or write.

JEALOUS NEGRO SLAYS
WIFE AND COMPANION
Captain Day reported that shortly
before daybreak on Sunday night, No
vember 13, during a territic gale,
rockets were sighted 220 miles east of
the Bermudas. The rockets were an
swererd by the Aros Castle and the
steamship's course was changed in the
direction of the rockets. The sea was
running so high that the steamship
could not safely go near the distressed
vessel and she lay waiting for day
light. , .. ,
After daybreak it was learned that
the distressed vessel was the Tafalla,
995 tons, Captain S. Roig, with a cargo
of pitch pine from Brunswick. Ga., for
Valencia. The storm was so great that
no small boat could be sent to the as
sistance of the Tafalla and Captain
Roig hoisted the following signal:
"Leaking six inches an hour. Main
pump broken and smaller pump
clogged. Men worn out."
Captain Day signaled that he would
lay by until the storm abated. Toward
noon, however, the captain of the Brit
ish steamship shot a line to the bark.
A hawser was fastened to the bark and
slow progress was made in the tur
bulent sea. Late in the afternoon the
hawser snapped and the Spanish vessel
again drifted helplessly, with water
gaining in the hold. Night came and
Captain Day stood by until morning.
With daylight on Monday it was
seen that the bark was lower in the
water but the British crew could do
nothing until the sea became calmer
because the only hawser on the vessel
was the one that had broken. Monday
night the vessels were still together
and the rockets and flare lights were
kept going. After 4 a. m. Tuesday the
crew of the Aros Castle saw no more
rockets and all was darkness.
When daylight came not a sign of
the Spanish bark could be seen on the
ocean and it is the belief of the British
crew that the vessel was ripped open
by the tremendous waves and went
down with all hands on board.
The Tafalla. which formerly carried
the name of the Ammlna, was built in
1877.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 21. â The
British steamship Aros Castle, Captain
Day, fifty-seven days out from Java
with a cargo of sugar, arrived at this
port to-day and reported the probable
foundering on November 15 of the
Spanish bark Tafalla. with her crew of
fifteen men. during the recent southern
storm. The steamship stood by the
sinking bark for two days and on the
second night the Spanish vessel disap
peared. The condition of the Tafalla
when the crew of the Aros Castle last
saw the vessel was such as to lead
them to believe that the bark went
down during the night.

This completed programme declar

signed by 102 Zemstvo Presidents, in
cluding thirty presidents of provincial
Zemstvo committees out of thirty-two
who attended the meeting.
This document, setting forth the
necessity of reform, is all the more
striking and impressive because the
Zemstvo presidents who signed it.
while elected by Zemstvo organiza

five marshals of the nobility, the elec

The memorial will be presented
within a couple of days to the Min

The meeting to-day also adopted a
declaration in favo* of granting gen
eral amnesty to political offenders
imprisoned or exiled by administrative
order.
The foregoing is the final form of
the declaration of the Zemstvo repre

legislation, as at first reported, but to
be trusted with the framing of the

Nelson is still grinding away at "Smil

battle with Young: Corbett. The Dane
Is in fine condition now and within
striking distance of the weight, but
he still continues to work unceasingly.
He arose at daylight this morning,
ate a light breakfast and then climbed
Mount Tamalpals in search of small
game. This afternoon he spent an
hour In the gymnasium, going through
his usual stunts, and then took on
Frank Rafael, Eddie Santry and
"Stockings" Kelly for four rounds
each. The bouts were all fast and
furious. Kelly is a Chicago -welter
weight.
Corbett's Opponent Is But Uttle Above
Fighting Weight.
"Big Bill" Knapp captured the final
mile selling number with Byronerdale,
the 3 to 2 favorite. He slipped his
company at the start, and. though kept
busy the last part of the race, was
nearly two length in advance of Allo
path crossing the line at the judges'
stand. The show went to Evea G.
To make sure that Andrew B. Cook
would* not act as guide for Honiton
again, "Packey" Ryan engaged Eugene
Hildebrand to pilot his fast mare in the
six and a half furlong run at Oakland
yesterday. This was too much for the
owners of Cook, for they sidestepped
the issue by scratching the "bush"
sprinter. This action deprived the event
of all interest and Honiton was held at
odds of 1 to 6 in the books. The mare
won laughing and Royal Rogue got the
place, just as they figured in the bet
ting. Vesuvian finished third.
There was plenty of' business in the
ring, but the layers did not benefit by
the quick sales, as Toledo Was the one
horse to break the slate. But for his
free open-air exhibit the favorites
would have scored a sweep. The attend
ance was large and the track in excel
lent condition.
If ready, the introductory selling
sprint looked like a set-up for Moco
rito. Everything pointed to the fact
that the old mare was ready, as she
closed an 11' to 10 favorite. Back in the
bunch at the start, Holbrook perse
vered with her, and picking his way in
the run home with good judgment beat
Scotsman half a length. Edinborough,
the pacemaker, finished a fair third.
Estella J, from the stable of Walter
Jennings, scored a very lucky win In
the five-furlong scramble, for two-year
old fillies. The daughter of Goldcrest
had evidently pleased the railbirds dur
ing the early forenoon hours, for she
was installed a 6 to 5 favorite. W. Da
vis, who had the mount, seemed slow
in getting away from the barrier, and
with Hildebrand oft* sailing on Meada it
looked very bright for the black filly.
Even when down within easy hailing
distance of the stand Meada looked a
sure winner, and then it was that Hil
debrand apparently grew careless. He
eased up a trifle, and Davis, coming
through on the inside with the favorite,
led him out a short head. Gallant Cas
sie, a 20 to 1 shot, finished a bang-up
third, beaten less than a length.
Mickey McLaughlin, the "Kerry
Patch Kid," with Glendenning under
him, spreadeagled his field in the third,
an all aee dash at five furlongs. The
chestnut sprinter came out after a long
season of rest at the seashore, and
made a cat-hop of it. Sir Preston, a
6 to 1 chance, was the runner up from
the jump and in a drive disposed of
Clausus for the place. Hildebrand pilot
ed the latter horse.
A mile and a furlong purse event
followed, and Divina had the honor of
being installed favorite. She not only
failed to finish among the first three-,
but swerved in at the start, practically
ruining the chances of Ink and Colonel
Anderson. "Big Bill" Knapp astride
the 7 to 1 shot, Toledo, slipped away
in the lead and was not caught. Mickey
McLaughlin on G. W. Trahern was the
contender throughout, taking the place
from Ink, with something up his jacket
sleeve. Hildebrand could extract no
speed from the carcass of Colonel An
derson.

The club has finally given up hope
to match Britt with Corbett. Corbett
insists on the same weight as when he
foucht Britt a year ago. but Britt re
fuses to make the- weight. He wants
132 pounds ringside or no fight. The
club managers do not care to take any
chances of losing a match with Gar
diner, as they believe it will be a strong
card. Gardiner is a boxer who was
comparatively unknown until a year or
so ago. He has defeated some of the
best lightweights in the country so de
cisively that shrewd judges picked him
to lower the colors of Champion Joe
Gans.
A telegTam from Denver says that
Gardiner left' there last night to ar
range details for a match with Britt.
The managers of the Yosemite Club
wired Sam Harris, manager of "Terry"
McGovern, asking him If he would
match his boy with Britt at 132 pounds
The Yosemite CJub will probably
match Britt and Jimmy Gardiner of
Boston to box in December. All that
remains to make the match is Gardin
er's consent to weigh either 135
pounds ringside or 133 pounds at 6
o'clock. He has agreed to 133 pounds
at 3 o'clock on the afternoon of the bat

but it is unlikely that Harri3 will agree

"That some â¢ of the dogs were
â¢doped,' " said Prandenstein, "appears
to have been proved, but the responsi

DOGS WERE "DOPED."
The Board cf Supervisors yesterday
by a vote of 10 to 4 defeated the pro
posed ordinance repealing an existing
ordinance which at present legalizes
:he selling of pools or making of
wagers on races between dogs within
the inclosure of the coursing park. The
ir.ajortty of the Joint Committee on
Folic- and Judiciary had recommend
ed the passage cf the bill in order to
close Ingleside Coursing Park, the
< onduct of which had been under flre
in a public investigation.
A petition was read signed by prop
erty owners and residents in the vi
cinity of Ingleside Courting Park ask
ing that the park be closed on the al
leged ground that it is a nuisance,
several women addressed the board,
raying that disgraceful scenes were
enacted ainor.g drunken patrons of
?he coursing park. The women made
earnest pleas that the park be closed.
Comte argued that the ordinance
should be passed in view of the evi
dence that dis ousting scenes were wit
r.^ssed and that women were allowed
t<> gamble on the races, aside from
any testimony that the dogs have been
â¢doped."
Brandenstein held that the park
rhould not be closed on the evidence
adduced in the hearing before the com
mittee.
The board finally passed the amend
ed ordinance to insure the conviction
of any one selling pools on horse races
outside of the inclosure of the race
track. The ordinance makes it un
lawful to make bets on races purport
ed or understood to be run, it having
been culed by the Police Judges that
under the old ordinance proof must be
adduced that the rate was actually
run. which, in the case of Eastern
races, was impossible to do. The or
dinance is aimed at cigar stores, sa
loons and barber "shops that make
handbooks on races.

headway that I was forced to resign my
position and seek relief at Hot Springs.
After spending all the means I had I went
to Memphis. In less than three weeks I
was in a hospital, and after nine weeks of
suffering I was discharged as^ cured. In
less than a month every Done in my body
seemed to be affected and felt as if they
would break at the least exertion. Again
I was compelled to resign, and I returned
to the hospital for a seven weeks stay.
When I came out I was advised to try
farming. When I first went on the farm I
prevailed on the only firm who handled
drugs to get me one dozen bottles of S. S.
S. At that time both of my hands were
broken put with blisters and I was covered
?eith boils and sores. In the meantime my
druggist had gotten two dozen bottles of
S. S. S. for me and I began its use, and
after taking the thirteenth bottle not a

"After she had asked me if I was a
policeman," said the witness, 'she said:
'Caesar Young was a married man and
he and I were lovers. He waa going.
away, and we might never see each
other again.' She then asked me If
Caesar Young waa dead, and when I
replied that he was she said: 'I don't
want to live now. Why should he kill
himself? He had everything to live
for.* "
"Did she 3ay anything else while you
were in the cab with her?"
"YeÂ«; she asked me if I had struck
Young on the head. I asked her, 'Why
should I do that?* ami she replied. 'To
kill him.' "
"MORGY" SMITH STARTLED.
Quinn said that Misa Patterson faint
ed several times in the station-house.
She was very nervous and asked hira
to kill her. saying that she had nothing
to live for. now that Caesar was dead..
"When J. Morgan Smith came to the
station-house." said the witness, "and
the defendant told him that Caesar waa
dead he seemed to be stupefied at the
new3." . '
Quinn said Miss Patterson told him
she was looking out of the cab when
Young shot himself. At thl3 point the
court adjourned until 10:30 o'clock to
morrow morning.
During the trial two skeletons, one
of a man and the other of a woman,
will be brought into .court to be used
in demonstrating the theory of the law
yers. One of the skeletons will be used
by the prosecution and the other by the
defense.
introduce you to persons who visit the race
track and all night Tenderloin cafes and pat
roniz* the roving cabman. Young came to
this country fourteen years ago from England
and from that tline he waa always on the go.
from race track to race track, always making
money. He possessed, traits that a man ousht
not to be proud of. but he had oth^r tra.it-*
that will recommend him to you. He was a
fair gambler, who gave honest odds and never
"welched." He was a maa of prepossessing
appÂ«arancÂ«, with a frank face and pleasing
eye.
He was singularly susceptible to the charms
of women and it was easy for a woman to
work her way intr> his affections. After meet
ing the woman who then called herself "Nan"
Randolpli. r.o matter where races werÂ» won
and- books were made. Young and -'Nan" were
to be found there together.
In March. 19O1, in hia sane senses, at his
wife's pleading. Young decided to shake
"Nan" Patterson. She was given f.S0O to leave
him. I am compelled to show the relation
that existed between Young ar.d this woman.
This evidence' will not be milk for babies,
therefore let us be strong enough to face the
truth, though we would far rather turn asi.ie.
PURCHASE OF REVOLVER.
Rand detailed the movements of Miss
Patterson and Young, declaring that
notwithstanding the money which was
given her as an inducement to leave
"Nan" said she had a better claim on
Young than any other woman and re
fused to give him ud.
Rand described Young's movements
or. June 3, which he spent with his wife.
He declared that on June 3 J. Morgan
Smith, the prisoner's brother-in-law,
accompanied by a woman, purchased a
revolver at Hiram Steam's pawnshop.
Rand continue^*.
The same night "Nan" and Young met, and
went to Flannery's saloon, where th?y re
mained until rÂ» o'clock the next morning.
During the night there were, a series of scenes
between Young and the woman. When he told
her that he was going away she replied that
he could hot. and that he could not hide him
self oa any ocean liner.
The next morning Younc met "Nan" and
they drove down town together in the hansom
cab in which the tragedy occurred. After the
shooting the revolver, bought on the previous
evening at the pawnshop, was found in the
dead man's right hand coat pocket.
I r.m soinir o call every one 1 know that
knows anythlne about this case. I am not
Koiny to produce J. Morgan Smith, because he
has left the Stat?. After the purchase of the
revolver he waa seen quarreling with "Nan"
Patterson near the Sixth-avenue pawnshop.
Ke wes heard to sav to her "You must do
it." and she replied. "I will not." Than Smith
slappfU his sister-in-law's face and pushed her
into the cab and sent her home. The witnesse3
we have to get are persons who saw the things
we expect to Drove.
FIRST WITNESS CALLED.
The first witness presented by the
prosecution. Harold M. Cole, a pho
tographer, brought forth an objection
from the defense. Attorney Levy
claimed that no photographs or dla-
Krams should be introduced as evidence
inasmuch as the exact spot where the
shooting occurred was not known.
The objection of the defense waa ulti
mately withdrawn and Cole Identified a
set of seven photographic views of that
portion of West Broadway, where the
shooting: occurred.
A diagram of the cab in which Young
and Miss Patterson were riding at the
time of the shooting was admitted as
evidence.
The first witness to- be called from
among those who were in the vicinity
of the cab where Young was shot was
William J- Junior, a policeman. He
saw the hansom coming up West
Itfbadway when it was about fifty feet
from where he stood. He could see
but one of the occupants. Misa Patter
son. His attention had been called to
a commotion in the cab by a citizen,
and as the vehicle drew up he ordered
the driver to stop. As he climbed up
on the step he saw a man whose body
had been concealed by the closed door.
The man was unconscious. Miss Pat
terson to!d him that her companion
had shot himself, and he ordered the
cabman to drive to a hospital. In the
meantime he had. found a revolver in
the right hand pocket of Young's coat.
The witness then identified a revolver
as the one he had found and it was
admitted in evidence. Junior said he
arrested Miss Patterson at the hospital.
??N'AN" WAS HYSTKRICAI-
On cross-examination Junior said thai
when he reached the cab Young's head
was lying in Miss Patterson's" lap. His
left arm was around her shoulder. JIis3
Patterson was hysterical and was cry
ing:
"Oh. Caesar, what have you clone?"
"Did she say anything else?" asked
Levy.
"Yes: she told me he had said to her,
'You may not see me agafrj.' "

the hospital to the Tombs just after
she had been crrested, told of a conver-

She brought 1000 tens of cargo and 140
passengers. Fine weather favored the
liner throughout the passage. Pader
ewski. th'? world famous pianist, was
a passei.ctrr on the Sonoma from Syd

qualities as a shipmate and express
regret that Pa<Jer*Â»wskl's plan did not
allow him to cross the Pacific on the

who arrived here yesterday.
Faderewski will arrive here on the
next liner, the Ventura, which is due
December 12. Mrs. Paderewski and
three friends are traveling with him.
Paderewski is grtatly interested in the

NEW YORK, Nov. 21.â The trial of
"Nan" Patterson for the murder of
Bookmaker Caesar Young was fairly
begun before Justice Davis in the Su
preme Court to-day and when adjourn
ment was taken at 4 o'clock this after
noon Assistant District Attorney Rand
had concluded his outline of the State's
case and had examined several of the
witnesses for the prc-secution.
There was not an unusually large !
crowd in the courtroom this morning, j
but when the doors were opened for the
afternoon session there was a rush to
gain admittance which swept the squad
of court officers off their feet. *
The main floor of the Criminal Courts
building was a solid mass of people,
and those who had business in the
court had to fight to even reach the
vestibule. The crush became serious
In a short time and police were called
in from the street to aid in maintain
ing order.
When the trial was resumed to-day
Justice Davis declined to excuse Fore
man Hendricks and Assistant District
Attorney Rand at once began to out
line the case of the prosecution.
RAXD OUTLINES EVIDENCE.
Rand warned the jurors that in con
sidering the evidence submitted they
I must not allow themselves to be influ
enced one way or the other by the fact
I that the defendant was a woman. The
laws were made for men and women
alike. He said that the only question
before the jury was to determine
whether the defendant was guilty â¢Â£
murder as charged. It was admitted,
' he said, that either Young killed him
'â¢ self or was killed by the prisoner at the
t bar. The prosecution was prepared to
! shew not only that Miss Patterson fired
the fatal shot, but that the act was j
one of deliberation and premeditation.
It would show that the crime was plan
ned at least thirteen hours previously
and that it was conceived a day before ]
the tragedy, when the pistol â¢ was ]
bought. All this would be proved by j
circumstantial evidence and the chain }
of circumstances, as presented by the ;
Â¦ prosecution, would be so strong that ;
i even if the defense should put a thou- ]
sand men on the stand and each of j
them say he saw the man flre the shot j
the Jury would not believe one of them.
Continuing, Rand said:

"SAMPLES ONLT"â The following are but
a few sample cases out of the MULTITUDE
successfully treated last week: Â¦ .
"CRIPPLE LEAPS" â Inflammatory rheuma-
tism stiffened my spine and limbs, could
barely CREEP along; last Tuesday Rexradlo
straightened me out and Umbered me up;
raised limbs naturally, RAN and LEAPED.
Many similar cases.
"LIFE SAVED" â "At the 'crisis* ot danger-
_oua disease be saved^my^llfe^
-DEATH AVERTED"â "Rexradlo speedily,
thoroughly cured me, of dreadful malady,
which slowly but surely leads to certain
death." -j
"SCIATICA" B DEMON FANGS exquisitely
tortured me; Rexradlo's power ipeedlly slew
this GILA Â¦ MONSTER and I entered a
PAINLESS PARADISE." '
"IT STAYS"â "Rexradio cured my OASTRI-
TTS in July; I stay cured.
â¢THE FIERY FURNACE of Typhoid Fever
was consuming me; Rexradlo quickly quench-
ed It and delivered me." Â¦
."COULDN'T STOOP through Lumbago: qulck-
ly, painlessly stooped and touched floor with
hands last week." (Numerous others.)
"NO RETURN TICKET"â "My canoer left
many weeks ago and havln&_no return ticket
it remains away." '
"PILLORIED FOR YEARS" by deforming
"articular" rheumatism. Joints solid and
"Immovable." helpless, entirely waited on
by others, lifted from and into bed, racked
with severest pains all over, groaning with
agony If even lightly touched, lying in bed
like a itatue of marble, Mrs. Knowles. 879
Bartlett by Rexradlo's ONE treatment was
Instantly able to freely, naturally, move
each loosened Joint roeÂ« unaided from bed.
and seated herself in a chair; first time in
years; her excruciating pains ceased and be-
ing at her request vigorously slapped she
declared the blows produced no pain; her
cheery welcome awaits "visitors"; she will
grasp and shake your hand with the hands
so long solid, and unable to close. SEE
HER.
"FIRMLY LOCKED JOINTS." due to AN-
CHYLOSIS in several cases recently, have
been UNLOCKED and set at liberty by the
MASTER KEY of Rexradlo's "humanized
Radium." (Proofs.)
DISLOCATED VERTEBRA." â One of the
spine bones thrown out of place protruded
outward Iv, producing PARALYSIS; Rex-
radlo's wfjiderful power replaced It, also re-
moved the paralysis so I could run and
LEAP; see me." A precisely similar case
had a like benefit a week since.
"IN ITS TOILS" â Acutely painful RHEUM-
ATISM had mÂ« In its toils: couldn't stoop_.
raise feet scarcely walk; Rexradlo touched
me twice and, stooping, I touched the floor
,with my hands, raised feet high. RAN and
LEAPED freely, painlessly; pains all gone
and smart slapping did not hurt. where ( the
least touch had produced agony before.
"MUSIC IN HI3 HEAD"â Totally deaf pa-
tient complained of hissing, crackling, roar-
ing and MUSICAL sounds In his head: after
(one) treatment he heard a WHISPER and
said "All those noises have ceased and even
my MUSICAL BOX haa RUN DOWN."
"FAR REACHING" treatment â Numerous pa-
' tienta have been successfully treated for
various diseases hundreds of miles away
without seeing Rexradlo.
"SETV'ERAL PHYSICIANS" . testify they SAW
Rexradlo treat alleged "incurable" diseases
with amazing success. (Names at offices.)
"LIKE MAGIC" â I saw the large CANCER
before R's (single) treatment; after, it was
lott to sight and touch. It was like magic.
"DANGER POINT'â Rexradlo'J (one) treat-
ment at once removed my bedridden friend s
agonies when her acute disease had reached
the "alarming" danger point; next day she
rose WELL.
"PERMANENT RESULTS" â One treatment
may and often does secure surprising re-
sults, the possible permanence of which de-
pends on a limited number of further dally
treatments. . y-^
"PUBLICITY'> Is objected to by the above pa-
' ttents. hence their "names'* are not here

FRESNO, Nov. 21. â The raisin and

Company was destroyed by fire last
n'ght. being the second packing-house

in Fresno. The plant was valued at
545,000 and was Insured for $30,000.
Fire Destroys Packlns-Hfmse.
The first night of the "campaign of
evangelization," as it Is called, began
with a street parade In which tramped
2000 men with banners, -with the band
of the Twenty-thini Regiment playing
hymns at the fore. The mile of frock
coated paraders moved through Bed
ford avenue to Hancock street, where
hung a great banner. Thare they held
an open-air meeting. Ministers from
fifty churches, all of Protestant de
nominations, were in attendance and
many of them made short addresses.
Every church In the district is joining
in the movement.
The street-corner meeting ended, the
brass band again headed- the proces
sion and it marched to the Central
Presbyterian Church, where a meeting
for men had been called. The church
has a capacity of 1500 and every seat
was taken and the closed doors held
out hundreds. Slxminlsters made short
addresses, telling the purposes of the
movement, which it was announced
will continue throughout the winter.
NEW YORK, Nov. 21.â The mlsdeeda
of hundreds of young men connected
with well-known families In the Bed
ford section of Brooklyn, which begran
some years ago by the formation of the
"Bedford gang" and finally led to many
of them and their recruits being con
nected with criminal cases, much to
the disgust of residents in that quarter,
has caused the Inauguration of a re
markable religious campaign for thÂ©
purification of the youths who spend
their time about the street corners.

United States District Judge de Hav
en yesterday handed down an opinion
limiting the liability of the Michigan
Steamship Company aa owner of the
steamer Proirreso, which blew up De
cember 3, 1902, the explosion killing
several persons. Claims to the am&unt
of 5100,000 had been filed by heirs of the
deceased. The opinion limits the,lia
bility of the company to $13,020. the
appraised value of the wreck. Heirs
of the crew of the Proereso killed by
the explosion will be entitled to dam
ages, but the- suits brought by heirs
of employes of the Fulton Iron "Works
arÂ« dismissed.
Judge de Haven holds that the com
pany is liable for damages claimed by
the heirs of the seamen employed by it,
and is entitled to limit its liability as
to such damages, but is not responsible
for the damaces claimed by the em
ployes of the Fulton Iron Works.
The Judge holds that the explosion
was directly caused by a Fulton Iron
Works employe named McGlnley hold
ing a lighted candle within two and a
half Inches from a hole, that he had
drilled' in the oil tank, thereby setting
flre to the escaping gas. The negli
gence of the company in placing oil on
board which would flash at the low
temperature of 85 degrees In a tank not
properly supplied with ventilators was
not the proximate cause of the explo
sion, says the opinion.

The Egg market is still soft, but quotations
are no lower, 83 the Thanksgiving demand Is
drawing on stocks of ranch Eggs and checking
any further accumulation. This check is re
garded as merely temporary, however, and Its

on Thursday.

The movement to ship a lot of Butter to the
East, which has been the feature of the mar
ket for EOTho days, showed signs of failing
yesterday. It ; appears that a number of houses
have suddenly become indifferent, and the
othera charge them with drawing out in order
to- let thifse.who do the shipping get their
Hutter off the market, then, Â¦ with the surplus
cleared up, the market will improve and en
able them to sell their own stock to advantage.
In other words, that they want the shippers
to do all the work and take all the risk,
while they hang back and reap the benefit.
Whether this charge be correct o r not, trie
matter has stirred up some irritation and
caused a halt in the movement, and the broker
who Is conducting the deal says that unless
the matter Is immediately settled one way cr
the other he will drop out of the deal. The
market showed 'no further decline yesterday,
and Indeed most dealers reported Increasing 1
steadiness In tho fine creameries, though
stocks arc still excessive .a.<d unwieidy.

Increasing supplies.

the latter being received by a leading retailer.
Prices of the general run of No. 1 stock
ranged from 24c to 2<!c per pound, with very
little business reported at the latter figure.
Borne handlers were firm In thrir views and

retailers were* holding off expecting a break.
The three cars of Oregon stock were not
placed on sale, but were held over for to-day's
market. Trade in live chickens was quiet and
prices were largely nominal. A car of West

day. The strength was probably due to the
fact that many traders who sold short on Sat
urday took frlrht at a rumor circulated early
to-day to the effect that there was a frost In
Argentina. .Another factor that tended to give
eupj>ort to the grain market was news con
corning world's shipments for last week, the
movement showing less than many traders ex
pected. For a time offerings were inadequate
to the demand and prices made a quick ad
vance. December sold to $1 00% and May to
$1 10%. Continued dry weather in the South
weÂ«t had some influence on the early bulge.
Suddenly sentiment In the pit veered to the
bear aide. Reports from the Northwest stated
that the movement of wheat from the farms
In that section would probably continue heavy
for several months and that elevators are lit
erally packed with wheat. Following the lead
of a large commission house said to be acting
for prominent Wall street Interests, pit trad
ers turned active sellers of the December op
tion. The result was a sharp decline. May
closed at $1 08% and weak. December fin
ished at fl 07%.
In the faoe of the sharp break In wheat
prices a remarkably firm undertone* prevailed
In the corn pit. December closed at 4Â»%e.
May closed at 45V4@45%c.
With only scalping trade, the oats market
held steady throughout the entire session. De
cember closed at 2S%@28&;o and May at

by Charles F. Hanlon. Hanlon filed his ac
count of the trusteeship yesterday.
Another factor which has a bearing
on the Hussian-Japanese war is that
Imports of- curios and other merchan
dise, the product of Japan, are more
than usually heavy at present. But
most surprising is the fact that these
Japanese goods are being offered for
spot gold at a discount of 50 per cent
off the regular quotations. The explan
ation of this is that Japanese mer
chants and manufacturers at home de
sire to turn their products into gold
with as little delay as possible that
they may be enabled to assist their
Government, by purchasing war bonds.
For the first time in the history of
this port the big. Appraiser's building
has been found too small to contain all
the dutiable goods that must be hand
led by the customs department. The
customs officials are required by law
to take to the Appraiser's store 10 per I
cent of all the dutiable goods of each
cargo that arrives. Work was practi
cally brought to a standstill yesterday
in that department, because from floor
to garret dutiable goods are piled up
bo closely that it is hardly possible to
walk between the piles. : The wharves
are groaning beneath their burden, and
the United States drayman cannot
handle the goods.
In i Â«2w of the congestion Collector
Stratton has given orders to the Ap
praiser's force to work overtime, and
has promised to appoint as many ad
ditional samplers, weighers and exam
iners as may be necessary to break the
blockade. He also issued an order that
an extra building be engaged for a
branch of the Appraiser's stores, so
that the work may be still further ex
pedited. He expects to have a large
building engaged within two or three
days.
The rapidly increasing trade with the
Orient is given as a reason for the un
expectedly large inrush of dutiable
merchandise from that part of the
world. Those mammc-th freight car
riers the Algoa, Manchuria, Korea and \
others, .whose capacity is from 12,000 to
16,000 tons each, have made a great
difference in the trade. Vessels of i
smaller ca pacify â¢ are arriving fully
loaded and adding to the difficulties'
of the custom-house problem. ;

CUSTOM-HOUSE
IS BLOCKADED
It is alleged by the San Francisco
company that the Mutual is laying its
conduit on top of and in close con
tact with the plaintiffs eight-Inch iron
pas main. It Is contended that on ac
count of the proximity and the defec
tive insulation of the box the electro
lytic effect on the metal pipe will be
increased and leaks will be caused. The
leaking gas, it is claimed, will be sub
ject to ignition from the highly charged
electric wires and this combination,
when mixed with air, will create a
dangerous explosive.
Besides the danger to the life and
property of the general public, it is set
forth that the nearness of the electric
vires will make it risky for the em
ployes of the gas company to attempt
to repair the main. A further difficulty
If mentioned in the purpose of the Mu
tual company to make at least two ex
cavations in every block, seven by five
feet and Fix feet deep, surrounded by
brick walls and covered with Iron.
These are to permit the new company
to distribute its wires, but, according
to the complaint will prevent t)Â»* plain
tiff from having access to Its mains
\nithout workinsr^through the wall and
a mass of wires carrying heavy cur
rents.
The Mutual company Is constructing
a power-house at Folsom and Spear
Ftreets and has laid its conduit along
Spear to Market and on Market as far
as Sansome. Excavations are being:
made west on Market. The conduit
is of wood, about a foot square, con
taining eleven compartments for wires
ar-d covered with tar or creosote.
According to the allegations in a suit
for injunction filed yesterday by the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany, its rival, the Mutual Electric
Lighting Company, is engaged in lay
in? conduits in Market street that may
prove a menace to life ar*" property.
The plaintiff company asks for a per
petual injunction and an order re
straining the work pending the litiga
tion.

J. C. B. HEBBARD. Judge.
November 21, 1901.
In the case of Delz vs. Wtnf ree, 26 Am. St.
Reports, page 75S, and In Walker vs. Cronln,
107 Mass., 5C2. the court says: "Every one
has a right to enjoy the fruits and advantages
of his own enterprise, industry, skill and
credit He has no right to be protected against
competition, but he hae a right to be free
from malicious and wanton interference, dis
turbance, or annoyance."
It la very evident that the acts of de
fendants were intended to inflict injury upon
the business of the plaintiff. It was a , de
mand that the plaintiff surrender Its rights to
manage Its own business In Us own way nÂ»
its own Judgment might dictate, and because
It refused to surrender those rights the de
fendants endeavored to retaliate. There are
not and there cannot be, any authorities to
sustain, the. defendants' contention. TherÂ«Â» Is

In State vs. Glldden, 3 Am. St. Reports,
page 20, the court says: "It seems strange
that In this day, and in this free country, a
country In which law Interferes so little with
the liberties of the individual, it should be
necessary to announce from, the bench that
every man may carry on his business as he
pleases, may do what he will with his own.
to long as he does nothing unlawful and
acts with due regard to the rights of others,
and that the occasion for such an announce
ment should be, not an attempt by govern
ment to Interfere with the rights of the citi
zen, nor by the rich and powerful to sup
press the poor, but an attempt by a large
body of workmen to control by means, little
If any better than by force, the action of em
ployers." *
FRUITS OF ENTERPRISE.*
The argument of the defendants Is. briefly,
that a court of equity has no Jurisdiction to en
tertain the case; that the acts complained or
come within the criminal department of the
court- In other words, the question Is: Can an
action In boycott be properly made the subject
of a civil action under the law of this State?
It appears from the complaint that It would
be almost Impossible to ascertain in an action
at law the amount of damage caused the plain
tiff by the acts of defendants, but, conceding
that it would be possible to ascertain a definite
amount. It appears from the complaint that it
would be impossible to collect any Judgment
rendered . for the same. If this be so, then
plaintiff has no spf-edy or adequate remedy at
law. and <>quity will step In to protect the
lights of the parties, for the maxim of Juris
prudence that "for every wrong there Is a
remedy" ought not to be considered a fiction.
Plaintiff simply asks for the protection and
preservation of property which by Its Bklll ana
Industry It has accumulated and now holds.
There Is guaranteed to every citizen, by the
constitution of the United States and the con
stitution of the State of California, the right to
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, the
language of the constitution of the State of
California, article 1, section 1, being: "All men
are l>y nature free and Independent, and have
certain inalienable rights, among which are
those of enjoying and defending life and lib
erty, the acquiring, possessing and protecting
prop'erty, and pursuing . and obtaining safety
and happiness."
In ex pane Debs, 158 U. S., 591. the United
States Supreme Court says: "When there is
an Interference, actual or threatened, with
property rights of a pecuniary nature, the
Jurisdiction of equity arises, and Is not de
stroyed by the fact that such acts are accom
panied by or are themselves violations of a
criminal law." The court held that the organ
ization or co-operation of worklngmen is not of
Itself against the public policy, but If the pur
pose of an organization or combination of
worklngmen is to hamper or restrict the free
dom of the citizen in pursuit of his lawful
trade or calling, and through contracts or ar
rangements with employes to coerce other
Â¦worklngmen to become members of the organ
ization and to come under its rules and condi
tions under the penalty of the less of their po-
Rltlons and deprivation of employment, such
purpose is against public policy and Is unlaw
ful. _ " "
DEFENDANTS' ARGUMENT.
This action Is broucht to obtain a per
petual Injunction against defendants. The
gist of the action as stated In the complaint
is that on or about the 3d day of October,
10(4. the said defendants entered into a com
bination, confederation and conspiracy for
the purpose of coercing plaintiff to subject
the control of ite business to the said Sta
blemen's Union. Local No. S7C0. and the
members thereof, by inaugurating and de
claring a boycott on the business of said
Plaintiff and. thereupon, and on the 3d day
of October, 1904, in pursuance of ,said un
lawful combination, confederation and con
spiracy, placed, and continued to place, rep
resentatives, or pickets, in f-"nt of the places
of business of plaintiff, carrying placards, or
transparences, which are false in fact, bear
ing the words and figures as follows, to wit:
"Unfair firm; reduced wages of employes nrty
cents per day. Please don't patronize"; that
these acts iof defendants have Impeded, and
will impede, the plaintiff In the conduct and
transaction of Its aforesaid business, and has
interfered, and will interfere, with thÂ« em
ployes, not members of said union, employed
by gald plaintiff; and that said actions of
defendants are for the purpose of intimidating
patrons and customers of plaintiff who may
desire or attempt to do business with said
plaintiff and that many patrons and custom
ers of said plaintiff have been, and now are,
frightened and intimidated from entering the
places of business of plaintiff, and the plain
tiff prays that the said defendants, their agents,
attorneys and servants, be perpetually re
mained and enjoined from the performance of
the said acts, and. each of the acts hereinto
before complained of, and from in any inan
ner Interfering with plaintiff In the conduct
of its business, and restraining and enjoining
the defendants, and each and all of them,, from
causing any person or persons, any agent or
agents any representative or representatives,
any picket or pickets, to be stationed in front
of. or in the neighborhood of. the said places
of business of plaintiff, or from otherwise, at
any time or times, molesting:, harassing, annoy
ing, threatening, Intimidating, or Interfering,
with any person or persons transacting busi
ness with plaintiff, and for such other and
further and different relief. Including costs,
as to the court may seem Just. Upon the flung
of this complaint and an undertaking, an or
der to show cause Issued, also a preliminary
restraining order. In the language of the
prayer of the complaint. Â¦ .' '
The matters now submitted to the court are
purely those of law, to wit: a motion to dis
solve the restraining order, an order to *j}ovr
cause why the same should not be modified,
and a demurrer to the complaint.
The court's opinion is contained In a
written ruling upon three law motions
in the case of Ooldberg, Bowen & Co.
against the Stablemen's Union. The
firm was subjected to a boycott be
cause of differences with the union
over a question of wages. It sued for
a perpetual Injunction, and a tem
porary restraining order was granted.
Judge Hebbard denied a motion to
modify the order, a motion to dis
solve it and a demurrer to the com
plaint, all of which were based upon
the union's contention that it had a
right to picket, to boycott and to in
terfere with business and employes un
der a construction of the law permit
ting injury without damages.
Judge Hebbard's view of the ques
tion is preceded by liberal quotations
from the rulings of the United States
Supreme Court. The motions were
submitted to him on briefs, the plain
tiff being represented by Bush Fen
nell, attorney for the Citizens'
Alliance.
Following is the opinion
CAUSE OF ACTION.
In language stronger than any yet
uttered from a Western bench Judge
Hebbard yesterday discouraged the
labor union practice of boycotting. He
declared that the one boycotted would
be justified in meeting the acts with
personal violence under the right to
eelf-defense.
Strong Language of
Court is Used in
Opinion.
Manager Agler of the Southern Pa- j
clflc Company stated last evening that 1
there was no doubt In his mind that the
plates on the rails had been purposely j
removed to wreck the Owl, for it would
have been hardly possible for outsiders i
to .know that a freight train was to j
pass over the spot owing to the fact
that the latter had been made up at a
late hour and was not traveling on a '
regular schedule. Several attempts !
have lately been made to' wreck the j
Owl, most recently near Martinez and j
Salida, and it would not surprise the \
railroad officials if an Investigation j
should reveal the fact that the same |
persons had been Implicated in all the !
plots. It Is the opinion of Manager Ag
ler that some crank with an imaginary
grievance against the company is try
ing to wreck its trains.
ortunately the freight train pre
ceded the Owl by an hour, and when '
the engine and cars of the former went ;
off the rails a brakeman was sent to |
the rear to set a dariger signal and ;
warn the regular passenger train. It Is I
admitted by the railroad officials In this
city that had the Owl train gone over
the dislodged rails a serious wreck
would have resulted and probably many
lives would have been lost. / r
A dastardly attempt was made Sun- ;
day night to wreck the south-bound !
Owl train near Goshen, and although
the plans of the wreckers failed and j
many lives were probably saved, a !
freight train was derailed and the .
Southern Pacific Company was put to
considerable expense to clear its tracks
and repair the damage done. Shortly
before 11 o'clock Sunday night a freight
train on its way south went oft the \
Qrails a mile south of Goshen unction. |
The engine anfl nine cars were derailed.
A hurried investigation brought to
light the fact that the angle plates had Â¦
been unfastened from .the rails and the j
ends of the latter displaced. Not satis
fied with this work, the persons who re
moved the plates placed a fishplate be
tween the end of the dislodged rails, so
as to doubly insure the derailment of j
the fast train. |

The World's Greatest
Skin Humour.
Affects Every Age and
Condition.
The Only Sure Cure is
Cuticura.
- ' ; -\ Â¦
If there vrere not another external
ikln disease known, eczema would be a
sufficient infliction on mankind. It per-
vades all classes, and descends impar-
tially through generations. While some
are constantly enveloped in it, others
have it conQned to small patches in the
ears, on the acalp, on the breast, on tho
palms of the hands, on the limbs, etc.,
but everywhere Its distinctive feature Is
a small watery blister, which discharges
an acrid fluid, causing heat, inflamma-
tion, and intense itching, scaling and
crusting. ;
The Cuttcura treatment Is at once
agreeable, speedy, economical and com-
prehensive. Bathe the affected parts
freely with hot water/ and Cuticura
Soap, to cleanse the surface of crusts
and scales, and soften the thickened
cuticle. Dry, without hard rubbing,
and apply Cuticura Ointment to allay
itching, Irritation and inflammation,
and soothe and heal, and, lastly, take
Cuticura Resolvent, or Pills, to cool and
cleanse the blood. This treatment af-
fords instant relief, permits rest and
sleep in the severest forms of eczema
and other itchinjr, bnrnlng and. scaly
humours, and points to a speedy, per-
manent and economical cure of tor-
taring, dl8flpnrinff humours, eczemas,
rashes and inflnmmations, from Infancy
to age, when all other remedies and the
best physicians fail.
