TOGO MIST WIN THE BATTLH.
Expert* Jsay Defeat Would Mean Dis
aster to Japan.
WASHINGTON April 13. â Officers
at the army and navy are almost
â¢ncusly of the opinion that the
loss or defeat of the Japanese fleet
by the Russians would not only endan
he Japanese army in Mam huria,,
but probably would mean the loss of
the war to Japan. Lieutenant Com
mander B. E. Hayden of the Naval
Observatory said:
I expect * big battle will be fought between
the Russian Baltic fleet and the Japanese
Th* Russians wilt make a hot fight TnÂ«
Japanese are not half as strong ac the Rus
sian*. especially a* the three powerful Jfci*
â¢lan cruisers from Vladivostok will join Ad
relral RojestveniOcy's fleet. I do not believe
the Japanese will risk a Â«tan<i-up battle with
the Russians, but will attempt to cripple some
nf the big Russian battleships with then
torpedo-boat destroyer*. Admiral Togo's fleet
Is more effective than the Russian fleet and
sooner or later the Japanese will get the bet
ter of thÂ« fight. The Japanese will not ex
pose their vessels to the fire of the heavy
guns of the Russians in a stand-up battle
The Russians are greatly handicapped by thÂ»
presence of colliers and small vessels * Tne
battle will. In my Judgment, take place be.
tween Formosa and Japan.
General James F. Weston, commis
sary general, in discussing the position
of Japan in the event of the defeat of
her fleet, said:
The defeat of the Japanese fleet by Ad
miral Ro)Â«Â«tv*ntk>s big fleet would Imperil
the Japanese army in Manchuria. Russia
would then command the sea and could get
her supplies from the United States and could
uce the trans-Siberian Railroad exclusively for
f' â¢â¢" transportation of troops. This would me
f tnat the Rut clans could send enough men Into
Manennna to overwhelm Japan, which would
ba in a daturerous position, because it would
bÂ« difficult to maintain Its communication*
ac Â« supply the army with rations. Of course
the Japanese could subsist on the eountrv for
a little while, because they are very frugal.
But thÂ« army could not maintain Itself for '
any lenftb of time without a base of supplies 'â 
It la Â»> difficult undertaking to maintain
an army without a base of supplies, especially
when the army consists of 400, 000 to COOOOO
men. which would mean that it would hav#
to scatter over a territory of forty to flrtÂ»
raiJe* In order to get sustenance. Such tactic*
â¢would weaken the force of Japanese and prot>.
ably destroy its fighting value. Want of sup
plies ruinad the first Napoleon's army.

JAPAN EXASPERATES
STATE DEPARTMENT
WASHINGTON, April 13.â Betel To
bago pavapres in Formosa caused the
death of eljjht members of the crew of
the American ?hip Benjamin Sewall
and treated other members of the crew
in a cruel manner when that ship was
wrecked in Formosan waters some
time a?o. The story is told in olricial
correspondence published at the State
Department to-day.
When the Japanese Governments at
tention was called to the incident it re
plied that the Government of Formosa
would "efficiently and strictly censure
the savages and will warn them not
to repeat such conduct again in
future. '
Loomis, the acting Secretary of
State, promptly directed the American
Minister in Tokio to say to the Jap
anese Government that "something
more impressive than censure may
suggest Itself to the mind of that Gov
ernment."
The Japanese Government accord
ingly adopted punitive measures, but
found great difficulty in executing them
intelligently he-cause they could not
make the natives understand for what
they were being punished.
This Government then suggested that
several of the native chiefs known to
have been implicated in the incident be
imprisoned until some of the Formosan
officials could master their dialect and
make them understand why they were
being punished.
BOSTON, April 13.â The ship Benja
min Sewall hailftd from this port, and
her owners, who resided in Boston and
vicinity, called the attention of the
State Department to the Formosa out
rage last year, soon after the captain
reported the affair.

WASHINGTON. April >, 13:â Official

fact that the- Japanese Government, in 1
announcing to the American Minister
in Tokio on February 16 of '* last year
the . breaking \of "; diplomatic : relations
with 'Russia, assured ; him -that hostili
ties would not be commenced until
after a declaration had been, made.
The correspondence comprises as much
of . the diplomatic exchanges between
Washington and Tokio as the depart- i
ment think"' it expedient to/ publish '<
and among; the first is; the' following
official paraphrase of \a cablegram]
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, APRIL 14, 1905.
from Minister (/riscom, dated 'Amer
ican Legation, Tokio, February Â«J,
1904":
Mr. (Jrisoem re]>orts that the Minister of
Foreign Affairs stated that a declaration of
war will not be made until after the with
drawal of their legation, which will probably
take tw o or three days, and hostilities will
not bÂ»tln until aft'r the declaration of war.
In an Interview the Minister for Foreign Af
fairs went over the whole course of the nego
tiations, devoted attention to the extreme pa
tience and moderation of the attitude of Ja
pan, and stated that after having- asked the
Russian Government five times to expedite a
reply and, having- waited three weeks without
result, no alternative remained but to act.
On the following day, the corre
spondence showed, Minister Grlscom
reported that the departure of the
Russian Minister would take place on
February 12. On February 11, subse
quent to the receipt of the news of the
torpedo attack upon the Russian fleet
at Port Arthur of February 9, Minister
Griscom sent a brief telegram to the
department, of which this is the of
ficial paraphrase:
Mr. Griscom reports that the declaration of
war was Issued on the loth Inst.
No other correspondence shedding
light on this Incident is contained In
the notes published.
Of interest is a note of Secretary
Hay, dated May 5 last, to the Japanese
Minister in Washington calling his at
tention to the circulation in the Ameri
can navy of a note from the Consulate
General of Japan at New York ad
dressed to "the Japanese serving in the

scription to Japanese borods and contri
butions to the relief fund for Japanese
soldiers and bailors and In aid of the
Red Cross Society of Japan. While ad
mitting the right of Japanese in this
country to subscribe or contribute to
the objects mentioned, the Secretary
says in his note to Takahira:
Tet it is undesirable that such contributions
ihuuH be sought through the naval official
channels of this Government.
Secretary Hay then requested "that
you will inform the consular officers of
Japan in the United States of the atti
tude of this Government in the mat
ter."
The Japanese Minister gave the
necessary instructions to the Japanese
Consul General in New fork.

SENTENCES
WEBER TO
BE HANGED
AUBURN". April Judge Prewett
I to-day denied the motion for :â  a , new
I trial in } the case of Adolph AVeber, con
| victed of. the murder of : , his ;:, mother,
and then sentenced the youthful pris
oner to be hanged on ; June 30. Weber
; appeared :* pale -\ and 'â ; nervoun when ha
s; â¢heard 5 his doom and iuaxU> J feeble at
tempt, to '} look unconcerned. j !Â»*%â % V*s^j-|
Whr-n the case was called this ' morn
* - ing Attorney Grove L. : Johnson â  stated
i that; the defendant wished to make a
â  I motion for a v new trial 'on * the ; ground
of errors committed during the trial
and . that new . evidence had been dls
' covered which could not have been pre
| sented at the time of the trial.
NEW STORY OF PISTOL. .
Johnson then read an affidavit made
by Xathan S. Beard, residence not
stated, to the effect that in May, 1904,
he was working for the Santa Fe road
at Needles and there met a man known
as The Sailor." He bought lrom "The
Sailor' a pistol, an old model, Iver
Johnson, 32 caliber, No. 19,554. In Sep
tember, 1904, he sold the pistol to a man
employed in the repair shops in Oak
land, but he did not know his name.
When he read the evidence of Henry
Carr at the Weber trial that he sold the
pistol to AdolphWeber, he remembered
the number of his pistol. He communi
cated with Weber's attorneys and came
to Auburn at their request. He was
shown the pistol identified by Carr as
sold by him to Weber and found it waa
the same pistol sold by him to the Oak
land man in September.
The affidavit of Edward Harrington
of 1239 Stockton street, San Francisco,
was read. It was to the effect that on
July 29 he bought from Henry Carr a
32-caliber old pattern Iver Johnson pis
tol, as he was going to the Santa Crua
Mountains to camp. He went the next
day. He also bought some cartridges.
He wore at the time a suit of dark
clothes and a long, dark overcoat. He
did not remember whether or not he
wore a soft or a dark hat. He remem
bered the date because he went camp
ing on the 30th.
CORROBORATES HARRINGTON.
G. J. Applegate of 1420 Vallejo street
deposed that he was with Harrington
when Harrington bought the pistol
from Carr.
Affidavits by Weber were then read,
complaining that Attorney General
Webb had made no statement to his
counsel prior to the trial that Henry
Carr would be called to testify in re
gard to the purchase of the pistol; also
that he, Weber, had no knowledge of
Beard, Harrington or Applegate at the
time of the trial, so that their evidencÂ«
could be given at that time.
Affidavits were read from three phy
sicians to the effect that in their opin
ion it would have taken thirty minutes
to make the. burns on the bodies de
scribed at the trial. If petroleum had
been used the scent would have re
mained for two days.
Attorney Tuttle then devoted an hour
to a statement of the alleged errors,
and Johnson argued on the motion for
a new trial. He wai answered by At
torney General Webb, who contended
the affidavits were not strong enough
to influence the Jury. Judge Prewett
then denied the motion.
SENTENCED TO BE HANGED.
Weber turned pale when ordered to
stand up for sentence and refused to do
so, asking, "What for?" When Under
Sheriff May tapped him on the shoul
der he stood up and Judge Prewett
pronounced the sentence of death. The
Sheriff was then directed to deliver
Weber into the custody of the Warden
at Folsom.
Attorney Tnttle then asked for a
modification of the order so as to allow
Weber to stay In the Auburn Jail pend
ing the perfecting of an appeal, and it
was granted. Thirty days time waa
granted to prepare the statement.
During the afternoon a statement was
made by Tuttle that the agreement to
settle the bank caae was off, owing to
a hitch in negotiations.

Continued High Water ;
Cripples Irrigation System ,
Dependent on Arizona Dam
PHOENIX, Ariz., April 13.âContin
ued high water in Salt River to-day
caused what may prove a great loss to
' this valley in a financial way, through
I the crippling of the irrigation system.
A break was noticed about the center
; of the Arizona dam this morning and
i all day long it kept widening on the
side toward the headgate. At last re
i ports the breach was feet wide and
| still growing, it is a pile and piank
. structure and if the high water con
i tinues, as Meou probable, all may be
swept away. The results will be that
when low -water stage arrives the head
gate of the canal will be high and dry,
â  and unless some temporal y dam can be
! made the valley may be without irrigff
j lion water this summer.
The Gila River is at a standstill and
is not alarming, though still high.
Phoenix is now entirely without rail
road communication south. This after
noon the Maricopa and Phoenix Rail
road bridge over Salt Lake at Tempe
j was crippled by the washing away of
I the north side piles structure ap
proaches. The water is fully as high
as at any previous flood this year and
may do further damage to the ap
proach.
The Phoenix and Eastern bridge at
Tempe, which was crippled a couple of
days ago, cannot be replaced until the
flood recedes. The water is eating
away considerable acreage of farming
land along the river. Another Cave
Creek flood is working its way toward
Phoenix, but it is believed it will be
kept out of town by the newly con
structed embankment along the Salt
River Valley canal, as was the flood
water of yesterday morning.

SAVINE'S PLEA
TO THE CZAR
Alleged Swindler Appeals
for Permission to Take
Up Arms Against Japan
HIS A STRANGE CAREER
Claims to Have Served as
an American Officer and
Been Wounded at Santiago
ST. PETERSBURG, April 13.â Tne ;
case of Nicholas E. Savine, further I
known as the "Count de Toulouse-Lau
trece," who is charged with a long Tec- '
ord of adroit swindles in various parts
of Europe and who recently was ar
re|rted at Bremen and brought to Rus
sia to stand trial, is attracting atten
tion here. Savine, who is well known
in the United States, tells a romantic ,
story of his adventures and alleged
persecutions and has appealed to Em
peror Nicholas in recompense for the
services of his ancestors and himself
to Russia to free his name from the
cloud hanging over it and permit him
to rejoin the army, of which he was
cnce an officer, and serve against the
Japanese in Manchuria.
Savine, who claims he was natural
ized an American citizen in Chicago
April 27, 1896, is holding in abeyance an
appeal to the American Embassador
until he learns whether the Emperor
will allow him to serve under the
double eagle, even as a private.
In his petition to the Emperor Sa
vine sets forth his descent from a long
line of Counts and Princes, who inter
married with the noble French family
of Toulouse-Lautrece, claiming that he
is related to such aristocratic families
as the Belosselskys.
Savine in hie youth was an officer in â 
the aristocratic Chevalier Guards, but
left the service owing to having fallen
into the hands of usurers. Later he
served in the Turkish war, and he
claims to have been wounded at the
siege of Plevna. He recounts in detail
a long series of trials for various
charges which, he claim*, were
drummed up out of malevolence by his
enemies, as chief of "whom he names
former Minister of Justice Muravieff,
now Embassador to Italy. The final re
sult was his banishment to Siberia,
whence, after various adventures, he
escaped to America. There, Savine
gays, he served as a captain of cavalry
during the war with Spain, and he
claims that he was wounded at San
tiago. He enumerates among his
friends John A. Logan Jr., W. A. Ma
son and several prominent Chlcagoane.
Savine asserts that the present charge
against him, based on a Brussels swin
dle, is false and due to mistaken iden
tity and confusing him with a man
named Sawin.

THE SALOONS

Chapman, representing the Anti-Sa
loon League, to-day filed with the City
Clerk a petition signed by 6200 citi
zens demanding an election to deter
mine whether or not Los Angeles shall
have saloons. The ordinance under
which the petition is flled requires
only 4200 bona fide signatures to se
cure an election. The Clerk will com
pare the names with the great regis
ter and has asked ten days in which
to complete this task. The City Coun
cil either must pass the ordinance de
sired or call an election within twenty
days from the date the City Clerk cer
tifies to the sufficiency of the petition.
The legislation asked for is to pre
vent the sale of Intoxicating liquor in

rants or clubs. The penalty for vio
lation of the law if adopted will be a
fine of |600 for each separate offense
or six months in jail. The ordinance,
if passed, will take effect ninety days
after adoption. The Council has au
thority to pass the ordinance request
ed, but it is not expected to do so, and
the question will be duly submitted to
the people.

S. N. WOOD & CO.'S NEW CLOTHING STORE
OPEN FOR BUSINESS TO-MORROW.
No Expense Spared
in Fitting Up
the Place.
Art Room a Feature
of Superb Estab
lishment
1-Jv*Â»ry practical idea of modern store
furnishing has been combined to make
the new store of S. N. Wood & Co., on
the Powell and Ellis streets corner of
the James Flood building, the finest
on the coast. From a comparatively
email business at the present Market
street store S. N. Wood & Co. have
built up a trade in San Francisco
that demands an enormous amount of
jjoor space, and to satisfy this demand
th^y have fitted up their new quarters
in a style rivaling the greatest of
vican mercantile establishments.
Furnished throughout with mahog
any and old 'brass, the greater S. N.
Wood store combines simple elegance
vlth the luxurious finish of the art
and reception rooms, making the mr
r one of beauty that has never
seen in &n Francisco before. The
â¢ ss are ivory timed throughout,
and on the first floor the show win
uowa are finished in white oak, while
the furniture, tables, shelves, etc., are
inabogran> .
The large window space gives an
nous amount cf sunlight, show
ing the goods in their natural colors,
which is hardly possible in the average
Btore. The broad, carpeted aisles, en
abling the customers to view the goods
even th->ugh the store is crowded at
the time, extend over 25,000 square feet
r space.
â mi RECEPTION ROOM.
The first floor is devoted to men's
ready-tc-wea.r clothing, furnishings
end hau, while on the second are sit
uated the boys' and youths' clothing,
the tailoring department and girls'
outer garments. A special elevator
connects the two floors, in conjunction
with the eight elevators of the build
ing, and the three entrances to the
store make it easily accessible.
The crowning feature of S. N. Wood
&- Co.'s efforts to please the public is
the an and reception room, situated
<>n the second floor and accessible from
the street without passing through the
rtore. This reception room is at the
disposal of the ladies at all times for
; meeting place with friends while
d'.wntown or as a resting place while
shopping in the store. The room is
finished in the colonial style, with silk
tapestry and mahogany furniture in
dicative of the colonial period. Lux
urious silk portieres guard the doors,
harmonising with the green-tinted
Wilton carpets, and the light, which is
admitted through the stained glass
â windows, shea* a soft radiance
throughout the room.
Writing desks are at the disposal of
the public, and fine embossed linen sta
tionery with the Wood monogram can
be used. A maid is in constant at
tendance, while messengers wait upon
tiie public at all times, and, in addi
tion, the room contains a library of
choice reading, together with the cur
rent publications. On the walls of the
artioum hang photographic reproduc
tions of the world's masterpieces in
oil. Frc* catalogues will explain the
many pictures.
ART WELL REPRESENTED.
Art is here represented from Titian
h our modern masters. The "Last
.Supper," by Leonardo da Vinci: "Syn-
dies of Cloth Guild," by Rembrandt:
"The Immaculate Conception," by
Murillo, and the "Sistine Madonna," by
Raphael, are some of the works of
ihe ancient artists, while modern art

Burne-Joncs, Rossetti, Millet, Rosa
B.jnheur, Watts, Leighton and the
American, Toby RoÃentnal.
These works of art were collected by
Mr. Benjamin Wood in his travels
through Europe, and he made a spe
cial study of art for its furnishings.
Mr. Wood is the author of the "Suc
tal Man of Business," a book wide
ly read by the younger generation of
business men with profit and interest
and showing the extreme business ca
pabilities of this well-known member
of the firm and displaying his fitness
for directing the fitting of their new
store.

COAT OF TAR
FOR A WOMAN
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HUDSON. Mich.. April 13.â Fifteen
young women and four men, whose
names the police say are unknown,
tarred and feathered Mrs. May Post
on Monday night. Mrs. Post has been
living in the Retan building alone.
Well-known men have been frequent
ing the Retan block since Mrs. Post
took up her residence there, and this
gave rise to considerable scandal. Com
plaints made to the police were un
heeded, and some young married wom
en advised Mrs. Post by letter that she
would better leave the city. No atten
tion was paid to this, except that a man
supposed to be her husband suddenly
appeared on the scene.
Late on Monday night, after the
streets were deserted, fifteen women
and four men, all said to be prominent
in the city, appeared at the door of
Mrs. Post's quarters and gained admis
sion. They did not hesitate to make
their errand known, and when the
stranger tried to interfere the men of
the party told him he would better go
into another room and keep quiet.
The women then ordered Mrs. Post
to remove some of her garments. De
spite her pleadings they applied a thick
coat of tar from buckets which they
had brought along and then sprinkled
an abundance of feathers upon It.
Then they departed, with a warning
that if the rooms were not vacated
within forty-eight hours worse treat
ment would be inflicted. Mrs. Post has
disappeared.

IN A HOTEL BATHTUB
Domestic Troubles Drive the Divorced
Wife of a Denver Man to
Suicide.
CHICAGO, April 13. â The body of
Mrs. Grace Loomis, who claimed to
be the wife of Charles Loomis, said
by her to be a millionaire, was
found in a half-filled bathtub in a
fashionable boarding-house in Michi
gan avenue to-day. The body was
fuliy dressed and lay face down in
the tub. Frequent threats made by
Mrs. Loomis that she intended to
kill herself leave no doubt that the
case was one of suicide. Domestic
troubles are thought to have been
the cause.
From papers in the apartments the
police learned that she was the for
mer wife of a well-to-do citizen of
Denver, Colo. She was divorced from
him six years ago. Other notes were
addressed to Mary L. Darling, Lead
ville, thought to be a sister, and Mrs.
Eva Bartlett of Oberlin, Ohio.

convenience of the public in buying,
the goods being displayed to the best
advantage in all cases, and with the
immense amount of space they
will carry the largest stock of exclusive
high-grade ready-to-wear garments
ever seen in the West. A complete
tailoring department is to be maintain
ed on the second floor, and a new fea
ture will be added in the stock of girls'

CHICAGO, April 13. â Mayor Ed
ward F. Dunne to-day again endeavor
ed to effect peace between the con
tending sides in the present labor
trouble in Chicag-o, but at the end of
the day, after several conferences with
the labor leaders and representatives
of the employers, the situation was un
changed. Mayor Dunne to-night, how
ever, was more hopeful of peace as the
result of his efforts and the peace
negotiations will be continued to-mor
row.
The labor leaders declared to-day
that they were willing to meet the em
ployers, but the latter declined the
proposed conference and Mayor Dunne
was forced to meet the opposing ele
ments separately.
While the peace negotiations were
in progress to-day Montgomery, Ward
& Co. continued to make deliveries
with non-union teamsters. The ser
vice was interrupted, however, by the
strikers and their sympathizers, who
blocked the streets, making it almost
impossible for the caravans under the
protection of platoons of police to pass
through the streets. In several in
stances the crowds became so demon
strative that it was necessary for the
police to use their clubs and several of
the disturbers were hurt in the clash
with the bluecoats. During one of fthe
attacks on the strike-breakers three of
the non-union men were seriously hurt
and it was necessary for the police to
make several arrests before the crowd
could be dispersed.
Should the efforts of Mayor Dunne
to bring about an amicable settlement
of the difficulty fail, it is stated to
night that the employers will form a
comprehensive teaming company of
their own in order to carry on their
business should the strike spread.

CRIPPLE CREEK. Colo., April 13.-
Mrs. S. W. Vidler shot and instanlly
killed Mrs. H. C. Douglas in the Na
tional Hotel this morning. Mrs. Vid
ler went to the room her husband had
engaged, but did not find him there.
Then, surmising he might be in the
room occupied by Mrs. Douglas, went
there and knocked. Mrs. Douglas, at
tired only in a nightgown, opened the
door, and Mrs. Vidler saw her husband
take refuge in a closet at the same
instant. Enraged, she raised the re
volver and hred, the bullet entering
the heart of the woman who faced her
palsied by terror and screaming tor
mercy. Then Mrs. Vidler went into
hysterics, and her husband wrested the
weapon frcm her.
S. W. Vidler is an Englishman. He
served five years in the British army
in the East Indian service. Coming to
Cripple Creek about ten years ago, he
became a newspaper correspondent
and also engaged in mining. Two
months ago he quarreled with his wife
over his alleged attentions to other
women and left her, engaging quarters
at the National.
Mrs. Douglas was born in Calcutta,
India, and is said to have been the
daughter of a British officer. She was
the mother of two children living in
New York City. She was divorced, and
came West three years ago. Vidler
met her recently. He was talking with
her on Fourth street yesterday, when
his wife, who was passing, accused her
of alienating the affections of Vidler.
Mrs. Douglas replied that Vidler was
only a casual acquaintance. Mrs. Vid
ler has been released on a $5000 bond.
The Vidlers have three children. Mrs.
Vidler denies that the act was pre
meditated, saying she was taking the
revolver home as a protection at night,
and souerht her husband to talk to him
about the children.

PRAISES VIEWS
OF JEFFERSON
Bryan Declares the "Father
of Democracy" Had Fore
seen Great Evils of To-Day
HAYOR DUNNE s PEAKS
Chicago's Executive AVants a
Public Ownership Plank in
.Next Democratic Platform
CHICAGO, April 13.â Subjects of na
i tional significance to the Democratic !
1 party were discussed by the foremost i
! orators of the party at the Jefferson- '
: lan banquet held at the Sherman ,
i House to-night in commemoration of ;
j the birthday of Thomas Jefferson. The
dinner, however, in a measure resolved â¢
' itself into a jollification over the elec- !
s tion of .Mayor Edward F. Dunne, who
jis a director of the club and was
' among the speakers. All the speakers '
â¢ In their discourses referred to munici- j
; pal ownership and to Mayor Dunne's
! recent election on that platform.
William J. Bryan and George Fred
I Williams of Massachusetts were the j
! principal speakers. Bryan chose for j
1 his subject "Thomas Jefferson" and
; his remarks were greeted with un
stinted applause. Bryan took advan
j tage of the occasion to congratulate
! Dunne on his recent election as chief
. executive of the city of Chicago. In a
review of the public utterances and
> policy of Jefferson, Bryan showed that
.the "father of Democracy*,' had fore- !
â  seen all of the great evils that the-
I American nation Is now awakening to â¢
I and had endeavored by his , teachings
â  to direct his countrymen into pathways
I that would have avoided them.
! Williams took for his theme "Equal
I Rights to All and Special Privileges to
! None."
Mayor Dunne spoke on "Municipal
Ownership." After a lengthy discus
sion of this subject Mayor Dunne
ended his remarks by appealing to the
Democratic party to incorporate a
municipal ownership plank in the plat
form to be adopted at the next na
tional convention of the party. His
speech in part was as follows: :
The Democratic party won In the spring
, election because its platform plainly, clearly
i and truthfully declared for principles which
1 were for the best interests of the people. It
lost last fail because its platform was a com
promise and because the people believed that
it dealt In platitudes rather than principles.
I The results of these two elections should
1 teach the lesson to the men who .stand high in
I the councils of Democracy that evasion, insin
j cerity and retrogression should have no place
in the platforms of the .Democratic party. The
party must take and hold the advanced posi
tions. It must keep pace with the march of
events It must declare against monopoly in
I any and ail forms; against special privilege!
in â¢very Â»ul*e.
Private corporations have seized and taken
possession of the means of transportation and
conveyance of information, light and power,
all of them monopolies requiring the use of
I public property. By . possession of these mo
' nopolist they I have been despoiling and plun
dering: the people of this country. -
The people h&vÂ« at last awakened to <ne
i feet that such monopolies are unfair. Iniquitous
J and dangerous to the republic. The blow
struck in Chicago will be followed by blows of
like character throughout the cities of the
. United States. It will also be followed, in my
humble judgment, If the ' Democratic party
Is wise and prudent . and Incorporates in Its
next platform a ringing declaration In favor
: of Oorernment ownership of interstate rail
roads, telegraphs and express transportation.
â  by a decisive victory in favor of the common
people of this oonntry. , .
If the protective tariff be abolished and the
1 Government takes possession of the means of
transportation, of conveyance of freight. " ex
\ press packages and Information, every dajiger
ous trust in America will die a natural death
In five years. .
Tom L. Johnson of Cleveland was
the next speaker. He also spoke on
! municipal ownership.
Among others who spoke during the
evening were J. Hamilton Lewis and
Clarence S. Darrow. Lewis spoke on
"A Constitution to Fit the Institu
tions."
FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY.
Parker Responds to Toast at .Teffer-
son Day Banquet.
NPTtt* YORK, A.prll 13. â Seven
hundred Democrats attended the Jef
ferson day banquet at the Democratic
Club of New York at the Waldorf-
Astoria to-night. Many of national
reputation were there, and chief
among these was former Judge Alton
B. Parker, Democratic nominee for
President last November.
In addition to Parker the speakers
â¢were T"r>ited States Senator Newlands
of Nevada, Mayor McClellan of New
York City, Congressman Rainey of
Illinois and J. J. Willet of Alabama.
Parker was the first speaker and
he was enthusiastically received.
Frequently he was interrupted by ap
plause. The speech was on the
future of the Democratic party and
vas replete with suggestions for har
mony and urgent appeals against sec
tionalism. Parker said In part:
Wben analysed the Democratic party. In all
its past history., ha* been true to a few gen
eral Ideas arid policies. They may be numer
ated as follow*: '1 .j'l jjmUkjvnitWlS â  '
"' L â¢ A strict Interpretation of the constitution
which Implies resistance to centralization by
the Federal Government because It Is opposed
to the fundamental Idea of our system of
popular government and for the further reason
that all human experience shows that that
way dancer lie*.
2. The levy of Import duties and otnet
taxes with strict regard to thÂ« industrial In
terests of ail our people, whether producers
or consumers, whether manufacturers, fann
ers or workmen, and always at rates which,
while Just to all. shall be essentially revenue
prodticlns, thus eliminating monopoly and
favoritism.
3. Constant, unremitting attention to honÂ«
â¢ct. econcmlca.l expenditure of the taxes col- â 
lecied from the people; and
4. N*on-InterferÂ«nce In the political affairs
of other nations, thus making entangling al
liances as Impossible aa they are undesirable
and un-American.
These ideas are as vital as they were in
thÂ» earliest stages of onr national history and
Include, in t^elr logical ramifications, every
policy that can come before our people for
legitimate discussion and settlement. If. as i
a natural corollary, they are supplemented by
the riKid, ur remitting enforcement of the crim
inal law in both nation and States, there is
not much room for the intrusion of outgrown
for new-fangled forms of hysteria
and humbug.
fi. we. as Democrats, prove ourselves
true to a real and genuine reform of tariff
â¢bwsaa, bringing American common sense to
-oppression, if we shall only apply our
sflves to this great and commanding question
with the courage, devotion to principle and
rr-gurd for the interests of aJI the people which
ingTiishÂ«?d GrovÂ«r Cleveland, we will not
only deserve ar.d command the support of the
s;eat body o" consumers, but also invite that
of progressive and intelligent manufacturers,
uh â . in ail historical fiscal agitations, have
given up their special privileges and
â¢ i themselves to a system from which
-; somp of the manacles had been re- I
ni(.\ea. By so doing we shail eliminate evils I
and abuses from our Industrial system and
promote real progress.
Mayor McClellan was somewhat dis
concertfd by the cordial greeting he
received. He closed his address by
saying:
Opportunism has no place in the Democrats
I>et us cease worshiping- strange gods
go back to the god of our fathers and
t> the teachings of Thomas Jefferson.

Swift & Co., Armour and Kelson
Morris state that no beef has been sup
plied to the retail markets of Chicago
or to any other market of the country
during the last month and a half, ex
cept at a loss. This, it is declared, has
been partially due to the fact that the
breeders of stock and the handlers of
range cattle have been holding back
on supply until the grass of the range
becomes nourishing.

at retail on the average grade of sir

LEAVES BABY
TO STRANGERS
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
PORTLAND, April IS.â Mr. and Mrs.
G. Frey of 703 East Fourteenth street
found a 7-weeks-old babe on their front
porch a week ago and for several days
made an attempt to discover the par
ents of the abandoned babe. The search
proved futile and at last they decided
to keep the child, a beautiful little boy.
On Saturday last Mrs. Frey answered
a telephone ring and a woman In
quired concerning the welfare of the
baby. The voice at the other end of the
line seemed choked with sobs.
"The baby is well, thank you," she
replied, "but would you mind telling
me who you are?"
"I am the baby's mother," was the
answer.
"I want to see you," said Mrs. Frey.
"I want to talk to you about the baby.
You need not be afraid of me, but
come right over."
The mother appeared in a short time
and told a pathetic tale. Her husband
died recently, leaving her with five
children. She had to go out to work
to support them and did not know
what to do with the baby. She made
several efforts to get people to take it,
but without avail. She said she want
ed to place her baby where she knew
It would be properly cared for, and at
last decided to leave it on the Frey's
porch.

Drives Him Out of Home
OAKLAND, April IS.â A woman's
nerve bested a bold burglar last night
at the residence of Loncoln S. Church

Fairmount avenue. The woman is the
attorney's plucky wife, who stood her
ground alone while a pilfering intruder
breaking into the house was frightened
away before he had time to gather up
any of the Church family's lares and
pc nates.
Attorney Church was away from
home. Shortly after 9 o'clock Mrs.
Church was startled by the ringing of
the front door belL She made no re
sponse, but twenty minutes later was
again alarmed, this time by the crash
of glass at the rear of the house. She
rusted out of her bedroom, lighted the
gas and surprised the burglar, who was
in a hallway leading off the kitchen.
Instead of fainting. Mrs. Church made
a rush after the man, who stopped an
Uwtant. surprised, evidently, at the
woman's daring, and then made a bolt
toward the front door. He forced it
open and ran down the steps, Mrs.
Church following, only to see the fugi
tive disappear in the darkness. Satis
fied that she had driven off the thief,
the nervy housewife locked up the
house and awaited the arrival of her
busband. The police were notified this
morning of the occurrence.

INSANE BY COMMISSION.
Aged Father of the Young Woman Weeps
While Testifying Against Her.
Doctors Called in Case Differ Widely as to
Patient's Mental Balance.
OAKLAND, April 18.â After hearing
many witnesses and listening to much
family history, Judge Henry Melvin
and Drs. O. D. Hamlin and Susan J.
~Fenton decided that Miss Alice B.
Courtwright, daughter of Rev. C. W.
Courtwright, a retired East Oakland
minister, is Insane and she was com
mitted to Napa Insane Asylum to-day.
Her affliction shows Itself principally
through her talk abou^her family,
whom she has accused" of disgraceful
acts. Her father cried in giving his
testimony against her.
A determined effort is being made on
the part of the young woman to says
herself, and H. G. Walker, her attor
ney, has filed exceptions to the Judg
ment of the court and in the morning
will ask a Jury trial. If it is denied
he states he will begin habeas corpus
proceedings.
Doctors are divided in their opinions
about the woman's sanity, and allo
paths and homeopaths found another
rock to split upon. Drs. N. A. Cham
berlain and Clarence Selfridge main
tained the woman is sane, while Drs.
L. L. Rlggin and A. Shirk, the allo
paths, swore that she 'is insane.
She was found to V" insane at Chi
cago a couple of years ago, but friends
stepped in and got the court to allow
them to take her. She got away from
them. Owing to the charges made by
the young woman against her family
the matter has attracted considerable
attention.

PROTEST MADE
AGAINST FEES
Students of University Ob
ject to Tax Put Upon
Them by the Authorities
BERKELEY, April 18.â The attempt
of the university authorities to fill a
partly empty exchequer by doubling
the fees paid by students in the en
gineering colleges and by more than
doubling the gymnasium fee exacted
of students is not to be carried out
without a serious protest from the col
lege men affected.
To-day a petition addressed to the
authorities of the institution was cir
culated on the campus in which the al
leged injustice of the proposed action
was referred to and the desirability of
rescinding the order of the authorities
was explained. Scores of names were
promptly attached to the document,
and iri a few days it will be filed with
the powers in control of the university.
Prominent students who are familiar
with the affairs of the colleges here
profess to Bee in this latest increase of
students' fees the last straw upon the
camel's back. They declare that it is
unjust to arbitrarily add to the burden
of the engineering students with a 100
per cent increase of the fee exacted
from them. The money thus secured
is supposed to cover the wear and tear
and injuries sustained by apparatus the
embryo engineers use. Last year about
300 of these students paid the $5 fee be
fore going to the summer school at
Santa Cruz, where practical work re
quiring the use of a great deal of ex
pensive apparatus is done. This year
the same sort of school is to be op
erated, and students declare their be
lief that its success will be materially
endangered if the 110 tax is insisted
upon.
The charge of $3 for gymnasium pur
poses affects ail students. Until this
year only those who took gymnasium
work paid, and the charge was $L Now
all must pay, whether they take gym
nasium work or not, and the charge
is "$3.
The Regents at their meeting a few
days ago were informed by their fin
ance committee that the university's
income this year is to be less than hith
erto owing to change in the State's as
sessment figures, upon which a large
share of the institution's income de
pends. Economy, therefore, was or
dered, and with the economy ordered
has come the added tax put upon the
university students.
Students at the university now pay
an armory locker fee, a medical exam
ination fee, a military uniform fee, sem
inary room fee, delayed registration fee,
special examination fee, re-examinatlon
fee and a special fee for non-residents.
CONDEMNS HOME
OF OLD LADY
OAKLAND, April 13.â Surrounded by
rats and filth, unwilling to voluntarily
abandon her hovel that she called
home, Mary Elliott, a negress, reputed
to be more than 100 years old, has been
taken in hand by the Board of Health,
and her wretched quarters in a barn at
Twenty-second and Linden streets have
been condemned as unfit for human
habitation.
This drastic step has been taken be
cause the aged occupant of the miser
able hut has resisted for months ef
forts of charitably disposed persons to
better her condition. Attempts to in
duce the centenarian to leave utterly
failed. She persisted that here was her
home, for which she paid rent, and none
had the power to dispossess her. De
spite her years the old woman's mind
is clear and she has met all advances
with the same argument. Her friends
gave up in despair at last and appealed
to the authorities.
Concerning herself Mrs. Elliott is si
lent. She refuses to tell the story of
her life, only declaring that she has
passed the century mark. Among her
acquaintances her extreme age has
been a subject of much discussion, and
occasional remarks about her experi
ences seem to verify her claims.

CATCH MAN WHO
INSULTS CO-EDS
University Girls Breathe
Easier Now That Police
Have "Hugger" in Custody
STUDENTS GIVE ALARM
Boarding-House Inmates De
tect Berni Ameda in Act
of Accosting the Women
BERKELEY, April 13.â "C0-eds" of
the university breathe easier now that
the police have in custody the man who
has created a miniature reign of terror
during. the last few days in the vicinity
of Hearst Hall, where the women stu
dents most do congregate. Berni
Ameda, a middle-aged man, who says
his residence is at 333 Vallejo street, in
San Francisco, was taken into custody
by Officers Watson and Edgar of the
university police staff this morning
after a call for police aid had been sent
in by friends of some of the frightened
women students.
A mysterious "Jack the hugger" type
of individual has been haunting the
campus for a week, lurking in the by
ways and screened paths of the univer
sity grounds, accosting "co-eds" as
they passed him and in several in
stances attempted to embrace them.
The university police were Informed
of the strange man's actions and have
been keeping a close watch for him.
To-day a number of students in the
Walworth, a boarding-house near
Hearst Hall, observed Ameda accost
women students as they passed him,
and judging from the flight of the "co
eds" immediately after meeting the
stranger the Walworth House inmates
decided that the "hugger" individual
was in a position to be captured.
A hurry call to the police brought
Edgar and Watson to the scene and
they gave chase to Ameda. The man
ran several blocks, but was finally cap
tured. He "said that he came over on
the 7:30 o'clock boat from San Fran
cisco to gather pond lilies In Co-ed
Canyon. He was arrested at 11 o'clock,
and at that time had made no effort
apparently to get lilies. He will be held
pending investigation of the case and
identification of the stranger by "co
eds" who have suffered from his in
sults.

1 anger, the theatrical managers.
through the agency of a third party.
Abraham L. Erlanger of that firm was
chief witness to-lday. Erlanger was
asked what chance a manager had to
oook an attraction In the theaters con
trolled by the theatrical syndicate, to
which he replied that the chance was
good for a good attraction. For a poor
attraction he could not say what the
chance would be. Erlangcr said that
the syndicate controlled between sixty
fire and a hundred theaters. He said
thÂ« syndicate's share of the profits from
"The Auctioneer" amounted to $80,000.
"My share was not much." he added.
"Lan got one-third of that sum, did
you not?" asked counsel for Belasoo.
"Yea," the witness replied.
. "Don't you call 110,000 much?"
"No; not much." â â *;Â».Â»
Eriangw then testified that he booked
three theaters outside the syndicate
free of charge. These were the Lyric,
KÂ«w York; the Qarrick, Chicago, and
the . Majestic, Boston. He afterward
admitted, however, that Nixon & Zim
merman had an Interest in a play with
8. 8. A Lee Shubert. Who control the
Lyric and Oarrick theaters mentioned.
Brlanger was cross-examined at some
length and there were a number of
IfrÂ«ly tilts between opposing counsel.
"Did you not get between $0000 and
97000 from James K. Hackett for book-
Ing him In one of his plays?" was
asked.
"No. not for the booking; we were
practically his managers," replied Er-
Lan ger.
"Well, Who really was his manager?"
"He was his own manager."
"Yet you mart aged him?"
"Tea."
Grlanger said the syndicate got 26
per cent from the profits of "The Chl
oe*e Honeymoon," but nothing from
"Florodora."
The witness denied that he had ever
been "cruel" or "harsh" to Belaaco.

Pain in the
Head
lls a danger signal, warning
you that the brain nerves are
â irritated, and are
undergoing an unnatural strain. i
Frequent and prolonged at-
tacks of pain weaken the gen-

loss of memory, melancholy,

When the brain nerves are

CONRIED SUCCESSFULLY REVIVES OLD COMIC
OPERA " FLEDERMAUS." WHICH MAKES HIT.
Sembrich Is Brilliant
in the Role of
Rosalinde.
Burgstaller Will Sing
Part of Walther as
Farewell.
BLANCHE PARTING TON
"Parsifal" In the morning and after
noon, "Die Fledermaus" In the evening!
Yesterday's bill at the Grand Opera
house suggests a king's Jester behind
It. "Die Fledermaus" was the sensa
tion, in direct succession to "Parsifal"
of the year before, of the Metropolitan
opera season of this year. It was a
poignantly piquant sensation last even
in*.
Herr Conrled has shown himself a
variously astute Impresario during his
short reign. In his first year he cap
tured the roo's egg of opera to bang
about the neck of his season, then next
took the absurdly delightful step into
Strauss comic opera for a piece de re
sistance. The one thing was as suc
cessful as the other. One understood
why last night. Doubtless a peculiar
pungency was lent to the Tun by its be
ing Bembrlch â Sembrlch! â capering
across the stage as Rusallnde; the
Kllngsor of the afternoon, Ooritz, as
Frank, as tlcklesomely and rapturous
ly drunk as "Jimmie" Powers' China
man; and Dlppel, the erstwhile Sieg
fried, playing the gay deceiver in the
mornlng/s trews. But for all that the
fun stands on its own feet. The opera
is comic opera, genuinely comic, sls
zllngly comic all /the way through. It
came with something of the charm of
the discovery of a lost art.
They don't write comic operas like
"Die Fledermaus " these days. For one
reason the Conrieds of the day are not
willing to spill Sembrichs upon them.
And it takes a Sembrich to sin* a
Rosalinde. It takes, too. a Bella Alten
to sing the Adele. Little Fiitzl Scheff.
who, who knows but may have put this
adventure into Conrieds head, has had
to hark back to Yon Suppe, to
â¢Fatinltza" and "Boccaccio." From all
accounts Schumann-Heink. later re
cruit to the high art of comic opera,
needs an older and better medium.
Herr Conried. with triumphant inspi
ration, puts Sembrich into the rioto-us
gayety of "Die FledermauÃ."
Little kinks of laughter oatch one
all over in recalling last night's
"show." Franko found himself for one
thing, and waltzed in ardent and
Strauss-like fashion through the opera.
There -,vas not a girl under seventy
present who would not have taken Mr.
Franko's hand to the tune of the "Blue
Danube." Shades of "Parsifal." how
funny it was! The orchestra, fresh
from a five-hour Wagnerlan seance,
played as though It hadn't seen a desk
before that day. But Franko was the
particular wonder of it all. To Strauss,
Mr.* Frarko. who nodded through
"CavaJleria" last Saturday afternoon
and set the rest of us nodding, tossed
his Jong locks in a fervor of enthusi
asm.
Sembrich as the coquettish Rosalinde
showed a wit and sparkle incompara
ble. Great delight it was to bear the
spoken German as the singer speaks it,
as Dlppel, Ooritt, Alten and the rest
epe:i.k it. a lesson to aetorp in enuncia
tion. But Sembrich might never have
heard of a Lucia.
She tucked up her sleeves to the fun
as if grand opera were not. She
frolicked with the best of them, win
ning an Immortal laugh. The stage
has, indeed, lost an admirable come
dienne in Sembrich, with a delicate and
delicious farcical sense, and chic with
out end. Her aria. "Songs of the home
land" brought an imperious recall,
though the singer was not in so good
form as on Monday night. But she
gave the "Voce dl Primavera" in re
sponse, and was again heartily
thanked.
Miss Bella Alten made a fortunate
debut as Adele. Like the rest Miss
Alten gave the happy impression of
thoroughly enjoying: herself. Very
T\ell, Indeed, the lady sings. Her voice
is clear, bright, flexible, somewhat cold,
but most useful in the saucy music as
signed to Adele. Miss Alten was fre
quently recalled.
To say that she acted the part of the
masquerading lady's truild as well as
she sang it is high praise. Another de
but was that of Miss Marlon Weed.
who sang the part of Prince Orlowsky.
Miss Weed has an affective voice and
filled h. ht-r role amply â both ways.
The quartet of men again was hilari
ously tunny. Dippel as Gabriel yon
Eisonstein showed himstflf an admira
ble light comedian, flexible, witty and
ppl'ited In high degree. He sang. too.
must usefully. One wonders, too, how
Mr. Gorltz can ever again face Kling
sor, with that q;;lte shamelessly comi
cal Frank In between. And what a
voice!
To-morrow It will be heard in the
part of Reokmesser In "Die Melster
slnsei." and one can safely prophesy
a stunning performance. Mr. Gorltz
waltzing wilh the lady's maid, Mr.
Goritz planting a Kundry kiss upon
her cheek. Mr. Goritz "morning after"
arrival home, and Mr. Gorltz sobering
performances there, is comedy that
must be sÂ«en to be believed.
Mr. Greder as the Bat fell Just as
happily into the pitch of things. Mr.
R< -is.fi was an admirable imitation of
TÂ«-ddy Webb as Alfred, and as laugh
able. Frosch. the jailer â the part that
Mr. Conried himself takes when he
hasn't anything else to do â was capi
tally enacted by Mr. Bayer, and Mr.
Muehlmann as Blind must not be for
gotten.
The audience laughed until it cried
and laughed again, and went away
warm with gratitude for an immortal
memory.
To-r.ight Is the "Cavalleria" and the
Caruso "Pagl'acci." To-morrow there
is "Die Meisterslnger," with Burg
staller, the best Wagnerian tenor the
world now affords, as Walther. And
to-morrow evening, the farewell
right will be repeated the brilliant
performance of "La Gloconda."

DISCRIMINATIONS
TO BE ABOLISHED
Pacific Mail Threatens to
Withdraw Its Ships From
Line Between San Fran
cisco and Central America
Biwclal DUsatob to Tbe Call.
WASHINGTON, April 18.â The prob
ability that the administration will
lower rates on the Panama Railroad
and the assurance that discriminations
will be abolished have stirred the of
ficers and agents of the transconti
nental railroads. They will bring
pressure to bear upon both President
Roosevelt and Congress wherever they
can to prevent material changes either
In rates or In traffic arrangements.
It Is learned that when Bunau-Varil
la, the first Minister from Panama,
was here two weeks ago, he came
chiefly for the purpose of ascertaining
what this Government was likely to do
In the matter of rates and traffic rela
tions. He represented the foreign hold
ers of bonds o-f the transcontinental
railroads. He learned that it was prac
tically certain that the Government
would break up the relations now ex
isting whereby the Southern Pacific
and the Pacific Mail prevented compe
tition with transcontinental roads by
way of the isthmus.
The Pacific Mail, controlled by the
Southern Pacific; the Pacific Steam
ship Company and the Chilean Navi
gation Company have an agreement
making it Impossible for shippers on
the west coast of the United States to
get competitive rates to Panama, and
even if they could get them that far
the contract between the railroad com
pany and the Pacitic Mail would make
it Impossible for a man on the isthmus
to whom freight had been consigned to
get It trans-shipped to New York.
The Government will terminate the
contract with the Pacific Mail in July
and will put tramp steamships from
every point on terms of equality with
the Pacific Mail and Its allies.
The Pacific Mail threatens to with
draw its ships from the line between
Panama and San Francisco, and thus
deprive California shippers of the fa
cilities they now have for sending
freight via the Isthmus. The only ef
fect such action would be likely to have
would be to hasten the Government's
decision to establish a Federal line of
steamships on the Pacific Coast.
SAN FRANCISCO MAY LOSE.
Possible Effect of "Open Door" Policy
Â« for Panama Railroad.
WASHINGTON, April 13.â The infor
mation conveyed to representatives of
the Central and Bouth American repub
lics by the Secretary of War that there
will be an "open door" policy for the
Panama Railroad has aroused consid
erable discussion as to whether the
move will be of benefit to Pacific Coast
ports, especially San Francisco.
Under previous traffic arrangements
the routing of exports to Atlantic ports
was never made in the interest of the
Pacific Coast, and the "open door" pol
icy will bring Into still keener competi
tion the bidding for imports of the
southern countries. The bulk of the
general supply trade with that section
has been favorable to New York as
against San Francisco, but California
has been receiving its share of coffee
exports and a fair demand for manu
factures, principally mining machinery.
Any material reduction In transisth
mian rates would have a tendency, it Is
believed, to turn the tide of traffic east
ward, leaving a small margin for the
San Francisco market.
The War Department, of course, ex
presses no opinion relative to the com
mercial phases of the situation, but it
is known that considerable correspond
ence has been carried on with San
Francisco merchants, who are anxious
to know where they will stand. The at
titude of the Pacific Mail toward the
Central American coffee planters has
not always been friendly, and it is ex
pected that the southern countries will
take any advantage offered to turn
traffic in favor of the south-bound Kos
mos and other llr.es out of San Fran
cisco for transshipment at Panama.
COLUMBIAN HALF-DOLLARS
NOT ALWAYS CURRENT
Often Taken for Counterfeit by Those
Who Are Not Familiar With Ap
pearance and History.
Despite the fact that Columbian half
dollars were eagerly collected at the
time of the World's Fair at Chicago,
there are those who think they are
counterfeit mnn- â  as a wayfarer re
cently ascertained in a manner to say
the least uncomfortable. He wanted a
smoke as he was walking In upper
Sixth avenue, and entered the first
store that flaunted a wooden Indian
in hi? face. It was conducted by one
of the many "â helmers." He selected
his cigar and laid a Columbian half
dollar on Che showcase. Mrs. â heimer,
who had waited on him, examined the
coin closely. She bit it, rang it on the
glass and looked at it suspiciously.
If you don't want that I have the
change," he said. This seemed to con
firm her suspicion. "Abey, Ikey.
Rosey," she cried, and Abey. the
father: Ikcy, a husky son, and Rosey.
an equally husky daughter, came rush
ing out of a back room. Excited talk
in Yiddish and wild gestures, accom
panied by a minute examination of the
half dollar by three pair* of hands fol
lowed. Then the family quartet sur
rounded the customer, while "Issey,"
summoned from the back room, took
the half dollar to the druggist next
door to find out if It was good. The
customer in a towering rage looked at
the long dirty fingernails of the cigar
store family and decided to wait.
"lasey" returned with the drug man's
indorsement of the coin. "Never mind
you cigar," said the customer.
"I don't want it. Give me that half
dollar." "But you are smoking It,"
chorused the family. â New York

PVBUCATION 0FF1CE. ...7 THIRD AMD MARKET STRggTS. SAN FRANCISCO
FRIDAY ' -APRIL 14, 1906
SHIP SUBSIDIES.
THE coming aof Congress will undoubtedly take up and
enturc to hope decide favorably upon the question of
i rehabilitation of our merchant marine. The interest of the
country has been strongly aroused through the proceedings of the
Merchant .Marine Commission, composed of prominent members
of both booKl <â¢; GoMgretft, who recently made an extensive tour,
holding sessions in our most important cities, at which all sorts and
men were invited to attend and express their views;
ie almost unanimous verdict was reached that something must
ne. and that at once, to restore us on the ocean.
Even though it were not already generally known in every
bold throughout the country, the hearing before the Merchant
Marine Commission produced abundant 'expert testimony to prove
that we cannot contract, man and operate vessels under the Amcri
ag in competition with European nations, and that unless some
form 01 protection is adopted to offset this disadvantage we shall re
main, as now, an unconsidered, practically non-existent factor in
the ocean transportation service.
Further, it was unanimously recognized that the United States
needs, as do al! nations, a naval auxiliary fleet, the vessels of which
act in times of peace as commercial travelers and in times of war
are ready to assume their important functions in the navy. This re
quirement is provided for by a system of subsidies paid to mail ves
sels by the various governments, and the United States cannot but
follow the example.
â¢r inability to construct and operate vessels as cheaply as our
European rivals is the penalty which we pay for our higher standard
of wages and living. These we cannot reduce if we would, and
when the American masses comprehend the necessity of doing our
own ocean transportation the word "subsidy"' will lose its terror 3
for them.
We are not terrorized at the prospect of an expenditure of $150,
000.000 on the Panama canal, to be used at will by all the ocean ves
sds of any nations of the world to facilitate their earning millions
of dollars for carrying their own as well as our goods to the utter
corners of the earth. We were not terrorized at paying Spain
$20,000.000 â for what? A salve to her wounded feelings! Or at
freeing Cuba at an expense of hundreds of millions of dollars. Neither
are we "terrorized" at the size of our pension roll â $142,000,000 per
annum. We are rich enough to ignore these items â and we can be
come richer still when we put the shipyards and their allied 154 in
dustries which contribute toward building ships to work, and with
the vessels built retain in our pockets over $200,000,000 annually
which we now pay out to foreigners for transportation of our own
X, and distribute this wealth to American wage-earners and sea
men, the highest paid in the world.
To accomplish that result, should we be terrorized at the pros
>f an expense to the treasury of possibly ten or even fifteen
millions per annum? We may remember that an expenditure in the
form of subsidies is the key to unlock the strong boxes of the eapi
s and cause their wealth to filter through the shipyards into
channel of industry ; is the key to open the door to employ
thousands of youth who long for a seafaring life with a
before it. and is the key to lock the door through which mil

WORK OF PROMOTION COMMITTEE.
A 1A 1 PLISHMENT in a most thorough way of the work the
California Promotion Committee was appointed to do three
years ago is evidenced by the remarkable report recently made
executive officer. The figures show a rate of improvement in
prosperity of the State during the three years of the committee's
c much greater than that of the period of ten years previous.
It is reasonable to infer that the increase is due in large measure to
" rtl of the committee.
The secret of its success is that it has utilized the idea of co
â¢aiion to advance the prosperity of the community and push
progress forward more rapidly. The work of the committee has
brought about a feeling of good will all over the State, and has in
spired widely separated workers for the State's improvement to
heartily unite, while at the same time it provides the organization
by which that will is enabled to act most effectively and prevent dis
sipation of energy through scattering and misdirected plans.
It is pointed out in the report that in the ten years from 1890
to 1900 the bank clearings of San Francisco increased about $120,
000.000. and in the last three years, the period of the committee's
activity, the increase was $356,000,000. The exports in 1900 were
about $41,400,000, and last year they were $56,660,000. In 1900 real
estate sales were approximately $18,500,000. In 1902 and 1904 they
averaged $46,000,000 per year. In the matter of activity in building
the contracts for 1900 were $5,789,000. and in 1904 they were $15,
559,000. In the last two years Market street property has ad
vanced an average of 30 per cent. The travel to California on
Colonists' rates has greatly increased. When the period for this
travel was limited by the railroads to ninety-two days of last year,
tj there was an average of 583.3 people per day took advantage of it.
The assessed valuation of property in this city and the State shows
likewise a remarkable proportionate increase during the three years.
So also as to population. The committee estimates that our city
population is now 486,000.
The accounts given of the committee's publicity campaign, the
food of excursions, the visits to the East, the enormous correspond
ence, the breaking up of huge tracts of land by their advice, the
stereopticon lectures educative as to California, the State dinners,
and all the ramifications of its efforts to push the roots of prosperity
all through the soil of California, and all the branches of their ex
tensive plan to make our flourishing beheld by all the world, are
briefly and satisfyingly set forth in this astonishing report. The
committee is to be praised and congratulated, and the good work it
>ing should be aided with hearty co-operation all over the State, j

It has been said that war is the harvest time of the financier and Investor,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. APRIL 34, 1905.
SIGNIFICANCE
OF SPRING.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
is a love story, sung first
by a troubadour of old France,
and resung by poets of other
lands, which lives with the breath and
soul of spring. 'Tis vibrant with the
joy of life. 'Tis sweet with the vernal
freshness of the earth renewedâ strong
also with the spirit of young love. 'Tis
tremulous with that flutter of unrest
which, heard in the heart, is like the
soft promise of a bird note calling,
calling, to follow, follow.
It is the young old romance of Au
caussin, him whom Agnes Reppller
calls "a model of defiant and conquer
ing lovers," and of his sweet Lady
Nlcolette; it is the old young romance
of love and spring.
Read it. if you have not done so, in
the old French, jf you can. find if not,
either in Andrew Lang's translation or
in Richard le Gallienne'a critical
abridgment of it in his late volume,
"Old Love Stories Retold." For truly,
as the poet sings:
Mre*t the song, the story aweÂ«t.
There !s no man hearkens It.
No man living '.neath ii>e sun.
So outwearled, Â«o foredone,
Sii 1. and woeful, worn or sad.
But is healed, but Is glad
'Tis Â«o sw.-et.
Spring belongs particularly to lov
ers and to children. Nobody else feels
so fully the charm of its violet-weav
ing spell, of its April moods, and of
the white glory of the blossoming May.
Yet if there is a spark of youth left
in any one of us this is the season
when, like hopeful little ones hunting
for "luckles." we Â»ount the treasures
that we have and diligently look for
more.
To the old who still are young spring
is a grolden link between the past and
present. This truth came home to me
in an interesting way last April when
I war driving with a friend among
the hills of a New England country
side. Suddenly we came upon an old.
bent man who was standing, spade
in hand, enjoying with upturned face
the fragrance of moistened earth and
bursting buds.
"It's a fine day. Wind's from south
west," he remarked genially to my
orrmpanlon, whom he knew, when we
pulled up beside him. And his face
was as full of delight as the face of a
happy boy.
"Do you know a day like this makes
me think of mother," he went on con
fidentially, as we lingered to chat a
while. "After the boys left home we I
used to come out here and watch the
spring come up the valley. When the
wind came from the southwest she
used to like to feel it blow upon her
face."
Thus to -lovers, old and young, spring
may come as a blessing. For the
young it is a time of hope and longing.
For the old it may mean a resurgence |
of the spirit of thg dear, dead, long j
ago. Every year is wrought anew !
that miracle of the rebirth of a joy that
is bittersweet. The youthful lover de
sires to taste actually the nectar of
his dreams until his wish becomes a
painful pleasure. In tender memory
the older lover lives once more his
early romance through.
To any one who is alive indeed the
season should mean more than a mark
on nature's record of passing time, for
it conies with a visible advance, awak
ening an emotion that is almost tangi
ble. I
DON'T BE GRAVE, BE GAY AND DRIVE DULL CARE AWAY
NOT NEW.

VOLUNTARILY REFUSED
FLORENCE FOX
Â«7VNNE! Anne Wyatt! Cousin
/-A Anne!"
A crisp, girlish voice rang
excitedly through the house.
Cousin Anne called softly from an
upper room.
"Daisy â here, dear; second story
front.
Daisy Morse flew upstairs like a
whirlwind. Into her elder cousin's j
presence she rushed, scattering sev- j
eral letters and messages upon a I
table, exclaiming breathlessly:
"Uncle Jason is dead way out in
Denver!"
"Uncle Jason? And his moneyâ he
left it to you, of course?"
"Of course he did nothing of the
sort, after providing for me all these
years. He has treated me cruelly."
"Tut, tut. girlie. He has given you
a good education, with which to earn
your way."
"But you don't understand. He has
left his wealth to an 'old, valued
friend," providing said friend will take
me also. If he refuses, half of the
money goes to the church and half to
me: if I refuse, half goes to the
church and half to the aforesaid 'old
friend.' "
"You can refuse."
"And leave the usurper victorious?
I'll marry him, if only to make his
life miserable."
Daisy plumped into a chair and
burying her face in her hands in
dulged the tears that for several
hours had been struggling to escape.
Cousin Anne bent over her with en
couraging words.
"I am glad you came to me. We
may think out a plan to mend mat
ters."
"That is why I came." Daisy spoke
up eagerly. "You will help me, won't
you, cousin? Here are the letters;
read this one. It explains itself."
Anne read:
" 'If you are willing to abide by the
terms of Jason Morses will our client
will go at once. Kindly oblige him by
being rea.dy for the ceremony upon his
arrival, as his business in the West is
pressing. It will be necessary for him
to return without delay. Yours, etc.,
Wright, Sales & Company, Denver.' "
"I wired an answer telling him to ad
dress me here," Daisy remarked. "I
felt that you would be able to help me
out of the difficulty."
At that moment Jane, the maid, en
tered with a telegram.
Daisy tore it open.
" "Will arrive at 7 o'clock Wednesday
evening. Must return on midnight
train. Wright, Sales & Company.' "
"Wednesday! This is Wednesday! It
is now after 6 o'clock. Oh, Annie, what
shall I do?"
But before Anne could reply her
cousin pounced upon her in Impulsive
enthusiasm.
"I have it! You shall be Daisy Morse
and I Anne Wyatt this evening at 7."
The elder women laughed amuwdly.
"You must do something to induce
this scheming old Shylock to refuse
me," Daisy said.
"Tes." Anne agreed. "You are right;
an old maid of 40 would be more of an
incumbrance than a girl of 20. I'll wear
my longest face and plainest gown."
"Good. When our caller is announced
you shall be Daisy Morse to receive
him."
At precisely 7 o'clock the doorbell I
rang. Miss Wyatt, true to her promise,
sallied forth to welcome the stranger.
He entered, a Hercules of youhful
manhood.
"I come from Wright, Sales & Com
pany of Denver." he explained. "May I
see Miss Morse?"
"I am she," falsified Anne, flushing
guiltily.
"I understand that you are willing to
accept the terms of Jason Morse's will.
All arrangements have been made for
an immediate marriage. The reason for
such haste has heen stated in a former
communication. The others will be here
shortly."
He paused abruptly. Daisy, a vision
of radiant loveliness, had glided timidly
lrto the room. Their eyes met; it was
the moment of fate.
Anne took in the situation at a
glance. Approaching her cousin with
a wise little smile she whispered
roguishly:
"Are yo-u Miss Wyatt or Daisy re-
Morse?"
"Re-Morse," groaned Daisy, under
hor breath.
Turning to their guest, the elder
lady presented "the Miss Morse men
tioned in the will."
A look of unmistakable disappoint
ment overspread the man's face, but
before he could speak Jane irshered in
two gentlemen who had just arrived.
One was clad in clerical garb, Bible
in hand, apparently ready for a chris
tening, funeral or a wedding. The
other, gray, spectacled, wheezing,
sidled into the parlcr, squinting
through hia glasses. Upon seeing the
young man he hastened toward him,
exclaiming:
"Here you are. Sales. Have you ar
ranged everything for the midnight
train? No delays now. Where Is my
bride?"
Both women uttered ejaculations of
astonishment. "What is he?" the
younger demanded.
"Alfred Russell, my client, the old
friend named in your uncle's will," ex
plained Attorney Sales.
Anne, with white lips, 'repeated the
name which for fifteen years had been
to her but a memory.
"Alfred Russell."
Across Daisy's mind flashed the sad
romance she had heard of her cousin's
love; the misunderstanding and sepa
ration from that love many years ago.
One look at Cousin Anne's anguished
face sufficed. She, Daisy, would let
HE WAS ONE OF THEM.
Mrs. Henpexâ lt's all very well
for you to say control yourself,
control yourself! Some women
can't control themselves.
Henpexâ No, Maria; and there
are a good many men that can't
control them, either!
the money goâ 'half to the church and
half to Alfred Russell."
Even as she essayed to speak the
old gentleman peering nearsightedly
through his spectacles, recognized his
former sweetheart.
"Anne Wyatt! Dear, dearest Anne!"
he cried, opening his arms joyously.
Mr. Sales and Daisy became sud
denly interested in the fine view from
a side window, where a screen hid
them from Bight.
The billing and cooing might have
gone on indefinitely had it not been for
the minister who, finding himself for
gotten, sneeied loudly.
Mr. Russell was the first to come
back to earth, bringing Anne, beam
ing with long deferred happiness; he
asked that the wedding proceed.
Daisy demurely slipped to his side.
"You are betrothed to me, sir, by
the terms of my uncle's will â unless
you 'refuse,' " she interposed mis
chievously.
"Bless you, I refuse," he laughed
heartily, "as they do not permit po
lygamy In Denver. But you may come
along and I'll find you a husband. Eh,
Sales?" c
"Perhaps she will not need your as
sistance," was the reply, with a sly
glance at Daisy.

A SON OF SUNNY ITALY
DEFENDS HIS COUNTRYMEN
Harsh Criticisms Anent the Vilardo Tragedy Stir
Him to Plead for the "Heroes
of Toil."
To the Editor of The Call:
An unfortunate occurrence among
the Italians has once again given an
opportunity for many to give vent to
their hatred against all of us noble
children of a most noble and most
glorious mother, above all races of
the universe.
An isolated fact, the consequence of
a passion, gives a chance for fantas
tical stories of Mafia, Black Hand and
so on. But I do not intend to in
dulge in comments. I want for my
own part and individually as an Ital
ian, exclusively Italian, Italian unto
death and Italian forever thereafter
to the day of judgment, before all
race?, before all peoples and before
all gods, to protest against the infam
ous, vile, infernai assertions that there
is a Mafia among us. You should look
up some reliable encyclopedia and
find out what it really is. If there
ever was a Mafia it existed only cen
turies ago.
Before you talk of the Italians
think that these Italians are the
greatest factors in the prosperity of
your very country. To these heroes of
toil you owe everything there is
most admirable in this, your country.
They bring here their beautiful low of
art and teach you. They brinsf their
sterling qualities as men, husbands,
fathers and sons. Their passion, their
love of the family sometimes prompts
them to commit some crime, but in
all cases it is love, true love. It i* not
the Italians that fill Jails for thieving
or similar dishonest actions. Police
patrols are not needed to pick up
Italian drunks along the streets of
your cities. The Italian >vorks and

FORESIGHT OF ROOSEVELT

To the Editor of The Call:
In your lucid editorial on the Santo
Domingo question you end by saying,
"Shirking is not possible" (with re
gard to Congress), and that "the stake
is too grave for trifling."
Both of these statements are easily
proved by the facts, and it seems to
me that as soon as the people, as well
as the Congress, study the conditions
of our present relations with foreign
Governments, and especially every
thing that concerns Latin America,
the President's policy will be indorsed
as the only Just and practicable one
at present.
The Monroe doctrine is either a
powerful, living truth for the protec
tion of all America (North, Central
and South), or it is a mere obstacle,
a phantom which bobs up at inoppor
tune moments, to cause ill-feeling
among the nations.
It does not need much historical in

Academy are to be used, their beauty
of tree and vine, with wooded paths,
making an ideal spot for the holding
forth of Â«uch revelry, as is being
planned. The afternoon will present
such features as a military drill, a
horse show, with the addition of
play. "Alice in Wonderland." This is
to be given in the evening also.
The carnival spirit will obtain in
every particular, troubadours and
masqueraders adding their attractive
quota. The lighting of the grounds
will produce an effect beautiful and
in keeping with the nature of the
event, which is receiving the untiring
attention of Mrs. Vincent Neale. with
whom are co-operating the following
patronesses: Mrs. William Babcock,
Mrs. John F. Boyd, Mrs. A. W. Fos-
for the love of her and his children;
he does not lean beastly intoxicated
against the counter of a grog Joint un
til his money is gone. These Sicilian*
that are so villainously insulted are
the ones that saved so many victim*
of the Rio Janeiro disaster right here
in your waters, giving such splendid
examples of self-denial and rare hon
esty.
And when anything so unfortunate
happens, do not point out the crime
alone, but show their otherwise good
qualities; do not say that crime is our
only propensity.
The assassins of Dr. Cronin were
not Italians.
The Guldensuppe murder of New
York was not by Italians.
The brigands of the West that kill,
hold up trains and rob right and left
are not Italians.
The merchants of human flesh,
those that sell wife and daughter into
infamy, are not Italians.
Tell the readers and show young
America that these Italians stand at
all times as examples of frugality, of
economy, of sobriety, of love and de
votion toward wife, children, mother
and father. Tell them that it is they
who till your arid soil and make the
land productive; that brave the heat
and dangers and build your railways,
your bridges, your tunnels; and they
work hard and patiently at all times
because their only ideal is the love
they owe their wives and children.
I. too, would be a murderer if any
one should attempt to wreck my
home, to dishonor my name, to in
sult my love or to harm my children.

I registered at the St. Francis

by him to the economic branch of the
Civic Federation of New York, of
which he ie a member, concerning cer

provoked much public discussion in the

brought to him on his Western trip
congratulatory letters from distin

Hon. Oscar Straus.
As a fluent talker and a careful stu

been able to attain. He expresses him-
D thee^ subjects: with an original

of the prevailing troubles. In fact he

existing discouraging relations between

Star Witness Against Frank
A. Maestretti Ordered Into
Custody of the Sheriff
IS TAKEN INTO COURT
Foreman Andrews of Grand
Jury Files an Affidavit
and Griyes Oral Testimony
Charles B. Merrill, the chi^f wit-
TiMfs against Prank A. Maestrettl,
president of the Board of Public !
Works, who was indicted by the !
Grand Jury for fraudulently attempt- |
ing to induce a person to tfve false |
testimony, will have to srive $3000
bonds to appear in court and testify
at Maestrettl's trial or remain in the '
custody of the Sheriff.
Following up Merrill's arrest by
Grand Jury detectives at Milpitas on \
Wednesday he was taken before i
Judge Lawlor yesterday afternoon.
Foreman T. P. Andrews of the Grand
Jury filed an affidavit in the case oi
Maestretti to the effect that Merrlil |
was a material witness on behalf of
the people at the trial; that affiant I
had reason to believe and did believe â 
that Merrill would not appear and j
testify at the trial unless security was I
required for his attendance: that Mer
rill had informed affiant that he was
going to Marin County, when in fact
he departed for Santa Clara County,
and that Merrill had informed affiiant
that he would leave his furniture in
his house, whereas, in fact, he had
sold a portion of his furniture.
The Judge said he was not quite
satisfied that the affidavit was ?uf- j
ficlent and he would like to hear some !
oral testimony. Foreman Andrews I
was then sworn and repeated Merrill's ;
conversation with him on Monday and !
subsequent developments, as already
published.
The Judge thereupon, under section
Â£7 9 of the Penal Code, ordered that
Merrill give an undertaking in $30<" o
bonds, to be approved by the preeid
ing Judge of the Superior Court, to
appear and testify in court on the
trial of Maestretti and meantime that
Merrill be detained in the custody of
the Sheriff.
A deputy sheriff took charg-e of
Merrill and went with him to the
County Jail, where he will be detained
pending his release on bonds.
Maeptretti's case will be called on
Saturday morning for argument on
the motion to set aside the Indictment
on the ground of bias and prejudice
on the part of the grand Jurors.
WANTS ALLEGED SWINDLERS
BROUGHT HERE FROM OHIO
Oscar LJptnan Swears to Warrants for
Arrest of Two Officers of Get-
Rich-Quick Concern.
Oscar Liptnan, a manufacturing
jeweler of 126 Kearny street, procured
warrants yesterday for the arrest of
two men who, he swears. inveigled
him into a get-rich-quick concern,
causing- him to lose $4400. The men
accused are Joseph Epstein and Carl
May. formerly president and treasurer
of the Pacific States Mercantile Com
pany. These men have recently started
the same business in Cincinnati, Ohio,
and Lipman wants them brought here.
Lipman says they came to him well
recommended from his friends in Los
Angeles and induced him to accept the
secretaryship of the corporation,
whose plan was to collect weekly
premiums on policies and pay the
holders two for one in United States
coin. Lipman was induced to invest
in policies, some of them maturing
and others still owing. Many Chinese
and women and children were caught
by the attractive proposition and are
still waiting- for the return of their
money.

The production of the Langrtry suc

a theatrical event of importance in
more ways than one. Frank Worth
ing, in the role of an unscrupulous
heartbreaker and thief, after his suc

than we have ever seen him. Another
feature will be the first appearance of

Miss Anglin's presentation of "The

the production. Manners will assume
his oriirlnal role, which he played
with Mrs. Langiry and which he wrote
for himself. Manners is author of
"Zira." He came here to supervise the

as being smuggled, have been ordered
returned without payment of duty to
their owners, Stettin & Co. of Paris,
France. The diamonds were brought
to this city by F. Hospital, a Spaniard,
traveling agent for the Parisian Jew
elers. There was a dispute between
him and Stettin & Co. as to his com
missions for selling diamonds in Ha
vana and the City of Mexico. The dis
pute not being settled to the satisfac
tion of Hospital, he smuggled the dia
monds into this country by the port
of New Orleans and came to visit rela
tives in Oakland named Romo. On
March 7 Mr. Romo reported to Col
lector Stratton that Hospital was in
possession of smuggled diamonds, and
the Collector, in accordance with the
statutes, seized the gems for confisca
tion. Stettin & Co., through an agent
here, represented to the Collector that
Hospital had embezzled the diamonds
from the company; that he had been
authorized to offer them for sale only
In Cuba, Canada and Mexico, and not
in the United States, and that his ac
tion in bringing the diamonds into this
country was unauthorized by Stettin
& Co. They argued it would be un
just to punish them for the unauthoriz
ed act of their agent. The Treasury
Department was of the same opinion.
and the diamonds will be permitted to
be exported to Paris without the pay
ment of the duty.

"MARRIAGE" IS THE TIIEME
OF SERMON AT CATHHDKAIi
Archbishop Montgomery Considers
the Separation of PnrentvS Inhu
man and Unnatural.
Archbishop Montgomery delivered
a sermon on Wednesday evening at
St. Mary's Cathedral on "Marriage."
His Grace said one thing was cer
tain and oatent to all â that there was
no other question that man could
conceive that affected more people.
The fundamental principle of mar
riage governed society. The Arch
bishop said that the permanence of
marriage was seen in its very objects,
one of which was the proper care and
rearing of the offspring â the helpless
and utterly dependent infant.
The separation of parents he con
sidered inhuman and unnatural.

EXTRADITION
FOND IS LOW
Governor Says He Will Is
sue No More Papers Ex
cept in Murder Cases
DISTURBS LOCAL POLICE
Officers Say Criminals Will
Be Bolder, Feeling Safe
Eefuge Is Near at* Hand
Chief of Police Dinan and Captain of
Detectives Burnett are considerably
exercised over the action of Governor
Pardee in refusing to sign requisition
papers for criminals outside the Stale
unless in "extreme cases" of murder.
They say it will give robbers, burglars
and embezzlers a free hand. All they
have to do is to get outside the State
and they will be free from arrest.
Detective Coleman returned from
Sacramento yesterday. He had gone
with the papers for the extradition of
William S. Loring, who is under arrest
in Chicago. He is wanted here for em
bezzling $300 on March 11 belonging to
his employer, Sidney A. Clark, manu
facturer of fixtures, 60 First street.
Coleman says that when he applied
to the Governor for his signature the
latter refused to sign the papers on the
ground that the funds for the extradi
tion of criminals were exhausted. The
Governor was informed that the com
plaining witness was willing to put up
the coin if he were reimbursed and
would wait for a year. The Governor
was inexorable and said that he would
not sign any papers except in extreme
murder cases.
Captain Burnett had a consultation
with Clark and he agreed to bear the
cost of bringing Loring back rather
than allow him to escape. Under these
circumstances Coleman will make an
other trip to Sacramento to ask the
Governor to sign the papers.
While Chief Dinan and Captain Bur- I
nett were expressing their amazement
at the action of the Governor a dis
patch was received from Detective
Whitaker at Sacramento that the Gov
ernor had signed the papers for the ex
tradition of J. H. Nicholson and that
he would leave for Portland to bring
Nicholson back. Nicholson is wanted on
a charge of passing a fictitious check
on the proprietor of the Chlco cafe, on
Market street. The receipt of this dis
patch puzzled the Chief and Burnett in ,
view of Coleman's statement, and, they
think there is a mistake somewhere.
A dispatch to The Call from Sacra
mento confirms the story of the Gov
ernor's determination in the matter,
and says he has sent a circular letter
to the District Attorneys of the State
asking them to exercise great care in
making applications for extradition
papers.

I mauled one at Schmidt's left shin that
â  removed some of the bark from that
section of Smillng's anatomy and car
omed toward the first corner. Larry
â was there ahead of the sphere and
then all the bap? were tenanted by
Giants. Dangerous Eddie Householder
then came out with his club and after
two strikes had been called on him he
Fwung his stick againÃt a speedy one
for a pair of bases and Garvin and
Van Buren registered. McCreedie hit
one to Streib that was too torrid to
handle and Schlafley passed in. House
holder tallied on Byrnes' attempt to i
nab him at third, the pellet striking
Eddie in the back and bounding into
left field. Van Buren made Portland's
first run in the Initial Inning and Mc-
Creedle the second run In the second
period. Van Haltren ecored for the
Oaks in the opening rally and Schmidt
tallied in the third period.

GARTER HANDICAP FIELD.
Some of UiÂ© Best Horses In Training
Will Face the Starter.
NEW YORK, April 18.â Probably
the most interesting Carter handicap
yet run will be decided on Saturday at
the grounds of the Queen's County
Jockey Club. The race will have about
sixteen etarters. perhaps more, and
with competitors from Los Angeles,
Hot Springs, New Orleans, Bennings
and local courses speculation will be
keen.
Floral King will carry the hopes of
many of the shrewdest men In the
East. Rapid Water will bear the
colors of E. E. Smathers. Opulent
merchants from Maryland and Vir
ginia will back the Albemarle stable
entries, Bohemia and Santa Catallna.
John A. Drake. D. C. Johnson and
their close friends will bet on Rose
Ben. J. B. Ha^gin and Sidney Paget
and his associates as well as the great
mass of the race-going public will de
pend upon Goldsmith, Belle Strome,
or Ormonde's Right, all of which have
worked fast.
Whichever of the trio will be chosen
by their trainer, "Jack" Joyner, to rep
resent the stable, will no doubt be the
favorite. Orthodox, said to be never
better, will have a formidable follow
ing, while those who have seen Em
peror of India run think he has a
chance.
COJfDON MAY OUTLAW HIMSELF.
Controlling Spirit in Western Jockey
Club Is In a Curious Posi
tion.
CHICAGO, April 18. â It was
learned to-night tha.t- Jack Condon,
the owner of Harlem Racetrack and
practically the controlling spirit in the
"Western Jockey Club, will throw open
the gates of his park In opposition to
Worth course, charging the regular
price of admission. During the ten
days following at Hawthorne, on
dates assigned by the Western Jockey
Club, the gates will be thrown open
and no admittance fee will be
charged.
In running counter to dates allotted
Worth and Howthorne Condon, un
der the rules of his own organization,
becomes an outlaw, and horses, Jook
eys, owners and officials presiding
come under the ban. This beine the
case, it is safe to predict that the out
law rule will be abrogated altogether.
One thing Is generally agreed upon
â Washington Park will run its
twenty-four days of racing without
opposition.

QUESTION OF WEIGHT
Both Boxers May Ask to Ha Ye
the Scales liaised Slightly,
as They Are Growing
Friends of Tournr Oorbett in this
city received wires last night to the
effect that he would start for the
ooast Immediately, as he has been
matched to fight Eddie Hanlon before
the Hayes Valley Club late In May.
It Is expected he will train at San
Rafael again under the dlreotlon of
Frank McDonald. He says nothing
about weights, but it is probable they
will meet at 180 pounds, weigh In at
6 o'clock, although both are getting
larger. Battling Nelson says Corbett
is the hardest hitter he ever met. If
he fets Into condition he should put
up a good fight. A number of other
opponents were suggested for Hanlon,
but none of them were known here
except Fitzgerald, who baoked out of
a match.
BOXER MORAN IN NEW YORK.
Clever English Bantamweight May
Meet Frankie Neil of This City.
NEW YORK, April IS. â Owen Mo
ran, the English bantamweight fight
er, arrived to-day on the steamer Ma
jestic. He was met by Tom O'Rourke,
who will look after his Interests while
he is in this country. Moran Is one
of the most promising looking fighters
that ever came from England. He
stands five feet four and a half lnohes,
weighs 114 pounds in fighting trim
and is 21 years old. He has been
fighting more than five years, during
which time he has engaged in forty
nine battles, losing only one, decision
to Jem Bowker, who holds the ban
tamweight championship of the
world.
Asked his plans for his stay here,
O'Rourke, speaking for Moran, said:
"I haven't decided Just yet what we
will do. I think I will have Moran
show at some of the vaudeville houses
for a few weeks and then I will match
him with some of the little fellows in
itmited round bouts in Baltimore or
Philadelphia. If Moran makes good
in these fights I will post a forfeit and
match him to fight Frankie Neil of
California for the bantamweight
championship of America. I feel cer
tain he will "make all the little fel
lows hustle on this side of the wa
ter."
Hayes Valley Club Boxing Bouts.
Bob Lundie and Bob Cairns* are
to meet for the second time this even-
Ing before the Hayes Valley Athletic
Club at Woodward's Pavilion. The
boxers are to clash for the lightweight
championship at 136 pounds, and are
In condition to make a fast fight.
Their last go .wae a whirlwind affair,
Lundie winning the decision by a
scant markin.
Abe Label and Johnnie Crowe, who
are also to meet in a main event,
have prepared themselves carefully
for their battle, as the feather-weight
title goes to the winner. Crowe und
Label are easily the best boys In the
feather-weight division, and in former
bouts have proved both game and
willing fighters. They are to weigh
in at 122 pounds, ringside. The re
maining bouts give promise of some
high-class fighting.
Brltt and Nell to Box.
Jimmy Brltt and Frankie Neil will
box for charity to-night at the For
est, Fish and Game Exhibition in
Mechanics' Pavilion. It will be a
friendly bout, but it will be fast, as
there is a slight argument between the
pair and both will want to make the
best possible showing. Neil challenged
Brltt a few months ago, notwithstand
ing the discrepancy in their weight.
To add tone to the affair the veteran
announcer, Billy Jordan, will Intro
duce the boxerg.
Willie Fitzgerald to Box Gardner.
MILWAUKEE, April 18. â It is
practically settled that Willie Fitzger
ald, the Brooklyn lightweight boxer,
will meet Jimmy Gardner, the Boston
crack, in a twenty-five round battle
at Goldfield, Xev., the latter part of
May. The boys will get a purse of
$1000, with the privilege of 60 per
cent of the receipts.

ESTELLA J IS MADE
MEDIUM OF A COUP
PLAYED DOWN FROM SO TO 1 AND WINS
True Wing Downs Gold Enamel and Other
Good Ones in Impressive Style.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Just a few played Estelle J to wlrf
the Futurity course sprint, fourth to be
decided yeserday at Oakland. The re
turns they received for the money in- !
vested, however, would drive a hobo to
purchasing automobiles with diamond
studded hubs and steam yachts blowing
smoke through solid gold funnels. The
first ones on the beat hurriedly picked
up all the 50 to 1 within range, the
camp follower*, foragers, raw recruits
and members of the awkward squad ac
cepting 25 to 1 for theirs. On April 3
Estelle J finished last, though it must
be admitted that she was up against It
on that occasion, and much oan be ac
complished in ten days. The good thing
â imply made her previous race look
like a typographical error of thÂ« print
er, for she led throughout
IMVO FAVORITES BEATEN.
At her heels followed the two favor
ites, Algelica and Lucrece, their re
spective riders several pounds over
weight, with hard luck â torie*. "Hand
riding" Kelly, who it appears does busi
ness with nothing but select goods, pre
sided at the automatic tiller on the
winner.
Four favorites and two outsiders fin
ishing first is the afternoon's record.
As both long shots were backed the
ring had an unpleasant session.
Titus, with little Graham on his back
and an 8 to 6 favorite, looked the most
eligible of the sixteen platers lining
up for the opening flve-furlong scram
ble. He passed Miss Hunter on the
stretch turn and, through superior
staying qualities, beat the Idaho mare
half a length. Olympian from the
Schorr stable took the small end of
the purse from Eldred.
A five-furlong dash for S-year-olds
saw Neva Lee finally escape from the
maiden class. Ridden by Bell and ex
tended to the last ounce, the mare
barely beat the 40 to 1 shot, Paddy
Lynch, three parts of a length. Indi
cate, at 15 to 1, ran third. Norinne
gave It up after displaying a wealth
of early speed.
LA CHATA WINS CLEVERLY.
Trainer Tom Cook Is sending the
Baldwin horses to the barrier in cherry
ripe condition. La Chata, a daughter
of Amigo, with "Cricket Kelly in the
saddle, showed a clean pair of heels
to a small field in the four and a half
furlong spin for 2-year-olds. The filly
led from the start and won ridden out
from Iron Watson and Pal. J. F. K.
Jumped the fence right after the start.
McÃride finally rode a winner. He
had the leg up on Evea O in the mile
and fifty yards selling recital and the
educated money went In on the mare
at 7 to 1. She led from the start, run
ning In a length In advance of Ray, a
18 to 1 outsider. War Times was third.
Mistress of Rolls, the favorite, got
away poorly and cracked no Ice.
Tom Ryan's crack filly True Wing
made life merry for her company in
the concluding mile and a sixteenth
purse event. Heavily supported at
odds of 8 to 2 she gave the slip to
Gold Enamel on the far turn and at
the wire defeated the Miller colt in Im
pressive fashion. The show fell to Tel
ephone.
TRACK NOTES.
It was quit* a day for the Kelly
family. "Cricket," the Baldwin stable
midget, and "Handrlding" Kelly each
piloting a winner. If the Utter per
sists in placing long shots over the
plate, somebody will be endeavoring to
buy his patent.
Tom Ryan will ship True Wing to
Kansas City, where the fast filly is ex
pected to give a good account of herse)f
in the Derby, to be run there next
week.
Travers said that J. K. P. swerved
and then straddled the Inner rail when
struck with the whip. The rider es
caped with a severe shaking up, but

STANFORD UNrjTERSITT. Aortl 11.
The Stanford four-oared crew will
meet the oarsmen of the University of
Washington to-morrow afternoon oa
San Francisco Bay at Sausallto. This
is the first time the two universities

done on Lagunlta Lake, a diminutive
body of water Just back of the univer
sity. The Northern four are an ex
perienced crew and tt seems they
should win the struggle to-morrow.

of California last year. These are
Captain Dole, stroke, and H. Q. Butter
field, bow. Both are football Dlayers
of renown as well as oarsmen. Dole
has played half-back on the varsity
for three years, and Butterfleld was
end on last year's team. F. Zimmer
man, No. 3, was a member of last year's
freshman crew. He has had a great
deal of experience in rowirur on the
waters about Portland. B. Bryan. No.
2, has learned to row since he has been
in college at Stanford. All of the men
are big fellows who are able to Dut
plenty of power Into their stroke. A
large crowd of Stanford rooters will
Journey to Sausallto to-morrow to see
the race.

Accident as She
Leaves
Overdue Bark Jane
Guillon Safe
in Port.
The Occidental and Oriental Steam
ship Company's liner Doric, Captain
Harry Smith, sailed at 1 o'clock yes
terday for the Orient. She was
trimmed like a yacht and made one of
the prettiest departures seen at the
Pacific Mall wharf since Captain Kin
der left the service.
The promptness of the Doric's de-
parture was responsible for a slight
accident. At the end of the wharf was
moored a State dredger. Ttie 1 o'clock
whistle, at the sound of which the
Doric began to move, was the signal
to the dredger crew that the noon hour
had expired. Promptly at the stroke
of l the dredger's engineer started to
_vying the big boom which carries the
mud bucket. The boom raked the
Doric's forward whaleback and carried
away an anchor davit. The damage
done was slight and caused no delay
in the liners leaving.
The Doric will call at Manila, for
which port she has eight passengers.
The Doric carried seventy-five Chi
nese and thirty Japanese passengers.
She has a large cargo, mostly for
Japan. Her cabin passengers were:

WILL FORM BIG
RAFT COMPANY
Wisconsin Capitalists Are
Here in Connection With
Gigantic Logging Scheme
MILLION FOR SAWMILLS
Logs to Be Shipped From
the North to Plants at
San Pedro and San Diego
Unless Congress sees fit to Interfere,
log rafting is to become a permanent
industry on the Pacific Coast. The
first step toward insuring its per
manency will be made some time this
week, when a big company Is to be
formed for the purpose of engaging in
the business on a large scale. Among
yesterday's arrivals at the Palace
Hotel was R. D. Pike, a millionaire
lumberman of Ashland, Wis., who has
come to San Francisco in the interest
of a big enterprise fathered by Captain
Robertson of Portland, who was the
pioneer in the rafting of logs from
northern ports to San Francisco Bay.
A few months ago Captain Robertson,
after demonstrating that rafting could
be made a profitable business, inter
ested Millionaire Hammond, the red
wood timber magnate and railroad
man, in a scheme that included the
establishing of big sawmills at some
point on the Oakland Bide of the bay,
where log rafts could be delivered from
the north and the material cut np Into
lumber. Later, however, Hammond
withdrew from the scheme and Cap
tain Robertson went East, where he in
terested Millionaire Pike and several
of his Wisconsin business associates in
the project. Necessary capital was
raised and Captain Robertson returned
to the coast to perfect arrangements
for carrying out his scheme.
It was decided to build sawmills at
San Diego and San Pedro, instead of
on the San Francisco Bay shore, and
with that idea in view, Captain Rob
ertson has, through agents, been quiet
ly getting options on sites at the two
mentioned southern ports. Millionaire
Pike came West by way of the south
ern route for the purpose of inspecting
the property on which it is intended to
build the mills and then proceeded on
to this city, where ha will be joined
by Captain Robertson and others who
have bor>-n interested by Pike in the
enterprise.
It was stated yesterday that the
log rafting company will spent^ about
$1,000,000 on its plants and expects to
cut about 30.000,000 feet of logs each
year. As the rafts usually consist of
between eight and ten million feet of
lops, it is estimated that the company
will send down from the Columbia
River and Sound ports each year three
or four rafts, unless their mills at San
Pedro and San Dleg-o are increased in
capacity or the. tefmpany decides to
build an additional mill at this port.
This will be the biggest rafting
project ever undertaken in the world
and will naturally excite much Inter
est, especially among the lumbermen
and the railroad companies, whose
business will be materially affected by
the success of the scheme.

POPULIST TTBBLES
GIVES UP THE FIGHT
Nominee \ for Vice President Last YCar
. : Disposes vof His Omaha
Newspaper. V
OMAHA, Nebr., April 18.â Thomas
Henry Tibbies, candidate last year of
the People's Independent party for
Vice President, has sold his paper, the
Independent, to George W. Berge.
This transaction is looked upon as the
final passing out of the Populi3t party
as a factor In the West. The Inde
pendent has been under the editorial
management or Tibbies for many
years and has been an ardent exponent
of the doctrines of the party.
Berge, the new owner, was a candi
date for Governor last fall, nominated
by the Democratic and Populist
parties and running on a reform plat
form with opposition to the aocept
ance of a railroad pass as his main
slogan. Berge ran 50,000 votes ahead
of Parker. He is looked upon as one
of the most prominent young reform
ers in the State.

DR. JOSLEN ACQUITTED
BY POLICE MAGISTRATE
Judge Conlan \ Holds â  That Charge of
. Having Caused "? Death of Mrs.
Lufey â¢ Is Not Proved.
Dr. O. C. Joslen, accused by a Cor*
oner's Jury of having caused the death
of Mrs. Frances Lucey of 704 Wash
ington street by performing a crim
inal operation, was acquitted yester
day on the preliminary examination
by Police Judge Conlan, who stated
that the prosecuting testimony was
Insufficient to support the charge.
Mrs. Lucey died on the night of
Friday, March SI, at the Pacific Hos
pital and made an ante-mortem state
ment to the effect that she was sub
jected to a criminal operation last
December by Dr. Joslen. The doctor,
however, testified at the inquest that
when the woman visited him for
treatment she told him she was suf
fering from the effects of a surgical
operation performed by another phy
sician and that he (Dr. Joslen) sim
ply gave her some palliative and anti
septic medicine*. Judge Conlan did
not consider a repetition of this de
fense necessary before him, as the
prosecution utterly failed to connect
the defendant with the causes that
led to the woman's death. So the case
was dismissed without Dr. Joslen hav
ing been called to testify.
Mnrder Trials Proceeding.
The trial of Elviso Turohettl,
chargred with the murder of William
McAllister at Pacific and Kearny
streets on Christmas night, was con
tinued before a jury in Judye Dunne's
court yesterday. The case for the
prosecution was closed and two wit
nesses for the defense testified. The
trial of Joseph Smith, the aged con
tractor, charged with the murder of
Joseph E. McGowan at the terra
cotta works. 2069 Mission street, on
November 26, was resumed before a
jury in Judge Lawler's court yester
day. W. P. Buttle, another eye-wit
ness to the murder, testified, as did
also Sergeant of Police E. J. Ward
and Policeman E. J. Thompson and Q.
W. McClelland. Nothing new was
elicited.
The case of Ancio Brissile, charged
with the murder of Joseph Brogardo
on Vandewater street on Sunday night,
January 22, was on Judge Cook's
calendar yesterday for the defendant
to plead. At the request of Brissile's
attorney, a continuance was granted
till Anril 21.

Chief Engineer Norton , presented
: the following report relative to de
fects in construction of Broadway
wharf:
"After examining the cylinder piers
under Broadway No. 1, constructed
by the Hyde . Construction Company
and completed on April 8, 1903. I
found two . cylinders that were not
: constructed according to contract and
are defective and must be rebuilt. I
notified the Hyde Construction Com
i pany of the condition of said cylinders
' and in the accompanying letter ' they
offer -to rebuild same to the satisfac-
I tion of the chief engineer."
The report was accepted.
The board decided to Invite bids for
â  the construction of a shed on Jackson
! street wharf. The engineer estimates
that the structure will cost 1750.
The following resolution was adopt
ed by unanimous vote: .
| "Resolved. That the secretary is
; hereby directed to communicate with
! the Honorable Board of Public Works
of the city and county of San Fran
' cisco and call its attention to the im
passable condition of the following

"In addition to the streets being in
bad condition for teaming, they re
quire cleaning, especially Spear street,
between Harrison and Bryant.
"The Commissioners' flret>oat has
been called out several times to put
out small fires caused by the accumu
lation of rubbish. The Harbor Com
missioners have notified their foreman
of the street gang to clean Spear
street, but it is clearly the duty of th-i
city to keep its streets in proper con
dition. All streets leading Into Ea9t

the city."

Oregon Crop Bulletin.
The report of Edward A. Beals, section
director of the United States Weather Bureau,
for the Oregon Crop Bulletin, week end^d
April 11. is as follows:
The winter was favorable for - fall sown
crops of grain end grasses, except iv a few
Bcaitt-red localities in the eastern sections,
â¢'here the cold weather 11; I" â â 1 1 ki:led
eons grain that u-as not well protected by
enow. The resecdinr of these area* Â»Â«â â  soon
afterward completed. The fall grain which
came through the wintt-r unharmed tÂ« in ex
cellent condition; the plant is well rooted and
it has etooled luxuriantly. Korage crops have
made excellent growth and pastures and ranges
afford abundant feed for stock. Larnblnj; Is
weii along and the losses have been flight.
Goat (bearing ie nearly completed and an aver,
age clip ,of mohair has been secured.
The s<-a*on is much earlier than usual and
the farmer* have their work well in band.
Spring plowing has advanced rapidly and
many farmers in the Willamette Valley have
th*lr spring wheat all seeded. Early ' sown
spring grain everywhere, has come up to a
good ftand and the grain crop generally is in
h. very satisfactory condition. Kapld progress
â  a* aso been made In planting gardens-, and
those planted early are making good advance
ment. Hops are. doing well and the cultiva
tion of the yards Is in active progress; some
* ines ar* far enough advanced "tor training
and twining, and this work now requires con
siderable attention. Corn planting lias Just
started In Southern Oregon.
Several frorts â¢.cured during the past few
ears and fruit, whicb ie generally In bloom.
has suffered to some extent; reports as to the
amount of damage are conflicting, but ap
parently peaches have been injured the most.
Peach, plum and pear trees have bloomed very
full, while the apple trees are not so full of
blcs* oniÂ» as usual.
The coll Is now in excellent condition for
plowing and germination, but more rain will
be needed before long, as it la drying out

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, April 18.â At any time to-day
the stock market would have been pronounced
spotty and Irregular, and it is only by a sur
vey of the day's trading a* a whole that the
amount of strength manifested It properly dis
cerned. This la because of the eystem of ro
tation employed by the active operaters in
conducting their transactions, the demand
chlftlng constantly from one to another stock,
and from one portion of the list to another.
While Dlcked stocks were advancing the gen
eral list was either held back or forced down
ward by the pressure of the profit-taking
**>â _, which went band-in-hand with the buy
ing of special stocks. It was not until late in
th* day that any clearly defined tendency de
veloped in the market. In the early dealings
there was considerable disappointment caused
to the professional element by the halt in th*
advance of those stocks which made the buoy
ant outburst at the doting list night. United
States Etel preferred. Union Pacific and Amal
gamated Copper were notable examples. It
was charact*rt*tlc of the market also that
after advance* bad proceeded for a time th*
â¢took thus affected would come to a pause,
while others were brought forward. Thie
process kept the traders constantly confused In
attempting to follow different movements to
determine the general trend of the market.
The confusion of mind led to a suspicion of the
market which was Quite stubbornly held. In
â¢aplte of the gradual spread of strength through
different portions of the bet. In the late
trading stocks which had been conspicuous
laggards early In the day were taken up In
their turn and advanced In consonance with
the movements elsewhere. The resumption of
the aggressive advance In Union Pacific had as
much to do aa anything with the decision of
the trend or the market. The manner In which
this stock ie supported in spite of the doubts
engendered regarding the flood of rumors con
cerning It end the failure of disturbing rumors
of various kinds to weaken the market effectu
ally ha* had the effect of Intimidating Ib*
bears and reassuring sentiment. It is said
that stocks are easy to sell and that any at
tempt at accumulation discloses a small float-
Ing supply. This condition was generally at*
tributed to the great strength of the general
situation, in which renewed confidence is
caused by the extraordinary conditions In the
Iron and steel trade disclosed by the statistics
for March. But this Influence was fortified by
reports affecting special properties. Thus
Reading's striking movement to-day was fos
tered by rumors that the tock is to be put
en a four per cent dividend basis. Stories of
a comprehensive combination of great corporate
Interest* in the copper, smelting and lead In
dustries helped the effort* of pools in the stocks
(tffected to advance their price Northern Se
curities settlement ' again emerged into prom
inence with the vague Intimation that next
week with the issue of the mandate of the
Eapreme Court for the distribution of the com
pany's assets, the great merger projects which
have been waiting on that event will culmi
nate The constant shifting of the demand
developed a large number of gains as the day
progressed. A movement to take profits car
ried prices back before the close, but they came
up again and the irregular closing was not far
below th* top level.

CHICAGO April 18. â Notwlthetandlng com
parative weakness at Liverpool, sentiment in
the wheat market here was bullish from the
start. Initial quotations on July were up 1
4Â© 'Ac at 8740. May was unchanged at
$1 154. Trading was largely In the July de
livery, the uncertainty surrounding the May
option being an effectual obstacle to any con
siderable dealings in that month. Short* and
commission house* were the best buyers. The
principal source of strength was constantly
increasing apprehension regarding the rsel
condition of the winter crop. That this fear
was not without foundation received apparent
confirmation later In the day, when numerous
aiivices from various parts of the country were
received, telling of deterioration In the condi
tion of the growing crox>. One resort from
'-'. Fort Worth, 1 \ Tex., .r. r claimed V that -\ in b several â¢'<
i counties -the wheat- plant" is showing 1 signs .of *
rust, and j. that on i account ;of I excessive 1 rains '

mented. Damage by lack ;of moisture was -.the 1
gist of numerous reports said to emanate from :
: different -points '-" in /Nebraska. .' Hesiian ' files
also were said to <be ; causing ' damage >In : that .-
State. In addition to .the bullish advices from

RIORDAN CALLS
FOR A MEETING
Members of the Republican
County Committee Receive
an Important Notice
rXEXTECTED HAPPENS
Gossip to the Effect That
â¢ Governing Body Intends
to Cast out the Ruelltes
There will be a meeting of the Re
publican County Committee at B'nai
B'rith Hall this evening. Some excite
ment was created in political circles
yesterday â  hen the fact was made
known that the chairman of the com
mittee had issued the following notice:
SAN FRANCISCO, April 12, 1905.
Dear Sir: The members of the Republican
County Committee art- requested to meet at
Bnal* Brith Hall, second floor, 121 Eddy
Â«r*et, Friday evening, April 14, 180*. at 8
o'clock, for the consideration of Important
mauler*.
THOMAS D. PJORDAN, Chairman.
There is gossip to the effect that the
governing body of the party in San
Francisco will rescind the action by
which A. Ruf' Increased the district
membership in order to get control of
the organization. The County Commit
tee, which meets this evening, was se
lected by delegates to the convention of
1&03 that nominated Henry. J. Crocker
for Mayor. During the campaign, which
culminated in the election of Schmltz,
the Rpublican County Committee was
guided by the United Republican
League. Ruef was practically cast out
of the league for refusing to support
the nominee of the Republican conven
tion, but prior to the league's action
in his case auxiliary members in the
several Assembly districts were added
to the County Committee, and many of
these 'auxiliaries" were tainted" with
Rueflsm.
There is gossip in political camps to
the effect that the meeting of the gov
erning body of the party is called for
to-night in order to forestall a general
â¢ meeting of the Republican Voters'
League, which may be held Saturday
night of this week. The general com
mittee of. the. Voters' League consists of
DM* active and- leading Republicans who
are confident that good local govern
ment can be secured through the
agency' of the Republican party. The
purpose of the league is to make a. con
test in every Assembly district of the
city, and through the primary election
law gain control of the nominating con
vention of the party. There are many
indications that the citizens who have
identified themselves with the new
movement for better government will
sweep away all boes resistance and
machine obstruction.

NEIGHBORHOOD FREED
OF UNCOUTH "BOGIE"
Police Capture Him in His Retreat
Women and Children Breathe Easy
and Sleep Is Restored.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Folk residing within a stone's throw
of the intersection of Oak and Broder
ick streets were relieved of harassing
trepidation night before last, when the
mysterious man who puzzled while b.6
scared them was captured by the police
detailed specially for that purpose. For
the first time in several weeks timid
housewives felt that they could slum
ber with Impunity, and husbands and
fathers slept without caring whether
their shooting-irons were within conve
nient reach from the bedside.
The man was gathered in from a cel
lar at Hayes and Broderick streets by
Patrolmen Berrie and McKevitt, mem
bers of the posse that was scouring the
neighborhood. He was booked as Ed
ward Burling, charged with vagrancy
and assigned to Judge Mogan's calen
dar. Tail, gaunt, tattered of apparel
and sallow of countenance, he looked
the part of the "bogie man" described
by frightened women and children. His
plea was innocence of either larcenous
or mischievous Intent when he unex
pectedly leaped from holes and corners
and made fearsome faces and lntim
idatory gestures at youngsters abroad
after dark.
"Then why did you do It?" the court
Inquired.
He did It to keep prying juvenility at
a distance, which would save his hid
ing place from intrusion. By profession
a vagabond, he begged food and money
for opium by day and occupied the cel
lar b-v night. His sole ambition was to
obtain "grub" and "dope" and non-in
terference. Work? No, he did not seek
work, nor would he accept work if it
sought and found him. Work would de
prive him of time and opportunity to
Indulge in the pipe-dreams which were
all he regarded his life as worth living
for. Besides, protracted slavery to
"hop" had incapacitated him for in
vestment of physical endeavor. Yes, he
guessed his case was Incurable, and he
hoped the court would so consider it
and hurry up with his sentence. He
was tired of standing there and wast
ing language.
With a sigh the Judge told him to re
appear to-day and ascertain whether
he will be sent to prison or consigned
to association with hia unfortunate ilk
In Chinatown.
John Scanlan, hackman, declared he
was more than amply provoked to
bruise the face of J. G. Fredericks, an
aged man, who manages an oyster
cafe on California street, near Hyde.
When he entered the restaurant night
before last, Mr. Scanlan said, he in
structed Mr. Fredericks to supply him
with food as expedltiously as possible,
explaining his haste by stating that he
desired to drive his vehicle to the
Grand Opera-house and get it in line
for a load of passengers. To his great
annoyance, however, Mr. Fredericks ig
nored the hint and went about his cul
inary task as deliberately as if he were
cooking for a person who had time to
squander. Reproof from Mr. Scanlan
only enhanced Mr. Fredericks' slow
ness, and finally, angered beyond the
endurance point, Mr. Scanlan smashed
a window and then flung his fist against
Mr. Fredericks' Jaw. Patrolmen Hogan
and Ellis arrested him.
"You ought to be ashamed of your
self for having struck an old man,"
said Judge Conlan to Mr. Scanlan, "and
you must remain in custody until to
morrow, when I shall prescribe your
punishment."
â¢ â¢ â¢
Henry Rogers Clayton and Charles
Johnson, brothers In vagabondage,
were Intoxicated and embracing each
other and shedding maudlin tears In
Union Square Park, when a police
man severed them. To Judge Fritz
they stated that the patrolman inter
rupted a reunion of two old friends,
who had unexpectedly met in the park
after being separated six years, their
last previous foregathering having
been in Cincinnati, when they took dif
ferent freight trains westward.
"And that each of you was drunk
when you again met may be set down
as a remarkable coincidence, I sup
pose," said his Honor. .
"If either of us had been sober you
might call it remarkable," responded
Mr. Clayton, smilingly.
Ten days apiece.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Almond C. Reupke had only $5
I when he consumed $12 worth of auto
j mobiling, visiting the Cllflt House and
| other points of interest to the tourist,
and when arrested for defrauding a
chauffeur he expressed great indigna
tion and drew a contrast between San
Francisco and "Noo Yawk" in a way
that did not redound to this city's ad
vantage. Judge Cabaniss gave him
twenty-four hours to "make good" the
$7 shortage or spend seven days in the
bastile maintained by a despised
â¢ municipality.
After many hearings, consuming
many hours. Judge Mogan Informed
Frank Macfee that he will be held to
answer before a jury in the Superior
Couri to the charge of Miss Torcl
Thorsen that ha betrayed her under

Mr. and Mrs. Charles Tullis were
separated '_ by Interlocutory : decree of
divorce when she caused his arrest on
the charge of failing to provide for
their, young "child, and when his at
torney convinced Judge Mogan ; that
she could not legally swear : to com
plaint against her husband, the inter
locutory decree not making the marital
severance complete, she was very much
agitated indeed. ; 5
"But any other person is qualified to
file the complaint," suggested â¢ the
Judge, a suggestion which Mrs. Tullis
was quick >to ; adopt. "Mamma!" she
shouted. "Mamma, come here!" and in
response to the call an elderly matron
rose from amid the bench warmers;, in
court and advanced -to ; the bench,
where she substituted the name of Mrs.
i Virginia Cramer for that of i the i orig
| inal complainant. "Thank you, mam
j ma," said Mrs. Tullis. "I guess that'll
hold him all right." ' . ; 'â '.

In his q*uest for a gold mine, alleged
j to have been lost' somewhere on the
! Mojave Desert, George Edwards ate all
: his provisions -J and drank ; his ; water
keg dry and found himself many* sandy
miles from the nearest source of food
and aqua supply. He never lost cour
age, however, but bravely turned his
back to the ascending sun and started
to retrace his steps to the town of
j Bagdad, San Bernardino County,
whence he had started a week before.
: For five consecutive . days ; and ' nights
â  he plodded the dunes, his only means of
sustenance being cacti, which grew in
great abundance on all sides of his un
i beaten path. When he arrived at
Bagdad the interior of his stomach felt
like a pin cushion in active service, but
In other respects he was fit as the
proverbial fiddle.
"Dear me," q\apth Judge Mogran, to
whom Mr. Edwards told iila tale by
way of conveying conviction that the
charge of vagrancy against him waa
destitute of foundation In fact. "Why
your narrative is Just like a Western
story In an Eastern magarine. And
3Â»ou actually relished prickly cacti as
diet."
"It's no wuzzer nor shad ter swal
ler, an' after It's swallered It's much
more flllin'," said Mr. Edwards.
"Them magazine fellers don't hey
sense ernuff to find out thet them cac
tusses is Jlst full o' grub an' licker.
W'y them catusees hain't got a thing
on airth ter do but sit in th' sand an'
drink doo an' grow big an' fat Any
guy wot starves ter death in a desert
ain't fit ter live."
Mr. Edwards stated, furthermore,
that he walked from Bagdad to San
Francisco, his ultimate destination be
ing a town in Toulumne County, where
a lovong wife and several dutiful chll
dred patiently await his homecoming.
"Whuther I'm broke or flush." he
proudly said, "th' old woman an' the
kids '11 be there with th' smile."
In the days of his youth, he added,
he was the champion pitcher of the
champion baseball team of the moun
tain counties, and many's the hot
curve he twisted at the present Cor
oner of San Francisco, who was the
stellar catcher of the region at that
time. "Me an' Leland," he added,
"wuz the warmest battery that ever
tossed the leather in them parts. I'm
goln' ter renoo acquaintance with th'
doc as soon as I get outer this fix."
He would have been liberated there
and then if a remorseless policeman,
with lip curling contemptuously, had
not pronounced him a "copper-plated
bum," who had not been beyond the
boundaries of San Francisco for many
years. Then the Judge sighed over
the shattering of a real life romance
and sentenced the putative cacti-eater
to thirty days of regulation prison
fare.

MAFIA'S SHADOW
AT THE BURIAL
Only His Brother and Three
Friends Dare Stand Be
side Casket of Vilardo
TO KEPEAT HER STORY
Mrs. Rosa Torturici Will Be
Principal Witness Beforfe
the Coroner's Jury To-Day
Only four Italians attended the fu
neral of Biaggio ViFardo yesterday, his
brother and three others. Though hun
dreds who had known Vilardo were
congregated near Castagnetto's under
taking parlors, where the simple fu
neral rites were held, only the four
dared enter and acknowledge that he
had been their friend.
Biaggio Vilardo collected money to
defray the funeral expenses of Joseph
Brogardo, a victim of the Mafia. His
fidelity cost him his life. Fear of the
assassin's knife kept all but four from
expressing sorrow over Biaggio Vilar
do's fate.
The^/thre^ men who stood beside the
brother are Beneditto Fretitta, Giovan
ni Tassia and Francisco Tarano. Rev.
Father Redihan read the Catholic
ritual and the four who defied the
vengeance of the Black Hand joined
him In a simple prayer for the dead
man's soul.
Outside the crowd Jostled and mur
mured. No doubt there were in the
throng members of the gang that had
plotted the hideous butchery. They
were there to bring back to the power
behind the Black Hand word of who
dared stand by the casket of one who
had incurred the displeasure of the
Mafia. Knowledge of the presence of
these agents of death kept back the
crowd.
There were among those hundreds of
people Sicilians from the same town
as Vilardo, but they only stood and
watched. Suddenly above the subdued
murmuring of the crowd was heard the
sound of a woman's sobs. A form in
black passed the door of the under
taking establishment. As she did so
the woman held one hand to her eyes.
She turned and was lost in the crowd.
Hers were the only tears shed for
Biaggio Vilardo.
BROTHER SHOWS PALLOR.
The brother's face was pale and sor
rowful. It is whispered throughout the
Latin quarter that he is moved by a
sterner emotion than grief. He wants
revenge. It is declared that accord- i
ing to custom he has sworn a ven
detta against the men who butchered
his brother. Some day he will find
them and then may be â unless they
kill him first, it will be blood for blood.
Maybe he will follow on their trail
patiently until the time comes. Like
the Oorslcan, the Sicilian can wait un
til the time is ripe.
The detectives have been scouring the
town for a trace of Pietro Torturici. .
The belief is that he is hidden some- j
where in or near this city. An extensive
search of the vegetable gardens
brought no results.
Governor Pardee offered yesterday a
reward of $250 for the apprehension of
the murderers, to which Chief of Police
Dinan added a similar amount. It in
believed that there are some In the
Latin quarter who could tell where the
fugitive is hidden if they dared. The
police have some hope that the reward
will cause some of these to divulge
what they know.
The Coroner's inquest Into the cause
of Vilardo's death will begin this morn
ing at 9 o'clock. Mrs. Rosa Torturici,
wife of the accused murderer, will be
the principal witness. She is still at the
City Prison. Judge Spinetti, her attor
ney, declares that he will not attempt
to have her released on a writ of ha
beas corpus until some time after the
inquest.
SAN JOSE OFFICERS ALERT.
It is believed by the police of San
Jose that Torturici, the San Francisco
murderer, and Pietro Caputo, who en
gaged in a cutting scrape in that city
April 4, 1904, are the same man. At that
time Torturici was employed on the
construction of the Saratoga-Los Gatos
road. There were some half-dozen wit
nesses, all Sicilians, who swore the cut
ting was done in self-defense.
Policeman de Carli, who was inter
preter in the. case, believes that Caputo
was none other than Torturici.
Chief Carroll and his officers are
searching the Sicilian and Italian quar
ters in the city to find the witnesses in
the cutting affray to see if they know
anything of Torturici.
To Begin Work on Budget.
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
will meet next Tuesday afternoon at 3
o'clock to begin the compilation of the
municipal budget for the next fiscal
year.
The estimate of the Board of Works
now brings the total amounts asked
for by the various city departments to
a sum in excess of $10,000,000. As
there will be but $7,000,000 available
under the $1 limit, extraordinary re
ductions will be made, especially in
the estimates of that board and the
Boards of Health and Education. The
estimates of the Sheriff, Assessor, Tax
Collector, Treasurer, Recorder and
Auditor will be the first to be con
sidered.
Cattle Must Be Removed.
The Supervisors' Health Committee
yesterday denied the petition of Mrs.
Frank Emhoff that she be given six
months' time to remove her cattle
from a dairy at 207 Lisbon street.
The complaint of the Labor Coun
cil against the alleged unsanitary con
dition of the kitchens of some restau
rants and hotels was referred to the
Health Board, the committee taking
the ground that the existing lays are
inadequate to compel proper sanita
tion.
