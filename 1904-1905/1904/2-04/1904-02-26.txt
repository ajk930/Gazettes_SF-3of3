RUSSIANS REPULSE ATTACK ON PORT ARTHUR;
NORTHERN MANCHURIA INVADED BY THE JAPANESE
LONDON, Feb. 26.â Following the disastrous attempt by the Japanese to sink merchant vessels in the harbor at Port Arthur, with the object of blocking the channel
to prevent the escape of the Russian fleet, Admiral Togo's warships returned early on Thursday morning ancf renewed the' bombardment. A brief dispatch from Viceroy
Alexieffs chief of staff to the- Czar reports a general repulse of the Japanese. Private advices from a Russian source declare' the losses of the Japanese were
heavy. More interesting than the Port Arthur battle is the confirmation of the news that a Japanese army has landed near Vladivostok to begin an invasion of northern
Manchuria with the object of getting behind the Russian forces and cutting their base of supplies. Vladivostok itself may be attacked by land and sea.

YIXKOW, Feb. 25. â Native reports that the ' Japanese
landed at Possiet Bay. and subsequently undertook operations
against Hunchun and 'toward Kirin have received qualified con
firmation from English missionary refugees who have arrived
at Newchwang. These persons say the-Russo-Chinese Bank has
removed from Kirin to Kwanchongtsi, where commercial in
terests are seeking safety and defense. This reported advance
has produced consternation among European civilians residing
in the line of -march. It is reported also that the Russian Gov
ernment bureau at Vladivostok has withdrawn to Khabarovsk.
Possiet Bay is in Russian Manchuria, about seventy-five
miles southwest of Vladivostok. Hunchun. is on the left bank
of the Tumen River and about forty miles to the west of Possiet
Bay. Kirin is a big Manchurian town, and lies about 220 miles
inland and to. the west of Possiet Bay. Kwanchongtsi is about
eighty miles west, of Kirin. Khabarovsk is about 400 miles to

The Mail, in commenting, on. the foregoing statement that
the objective point of the Japanese is Kirin.. says that in that
case a long march will have to be made over a very formidable

New York Shipbuilder Says
American Workmen Are
Behind European Brethren
STATE31EXT IS DISPUTED
Wallace Downey Gives In
teresting Testimony Be
fore the House Committee
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.â "Do you
mean the Scotch, the Irish or the Eng
lish laborers in the shipyards at Glas
gow can do 60 per cenj more work with
the same tools and in the same time
than can be done by American ship
yard workers?" demanded James O'Con
nell, president of the International As
sociation of Machinists, of Wallace
Downey, a New York shipbuilder and a
representative of "the New York Metal
Trades Association, during the progress
of a hearing to-day on the eight-hour
bill before the House Committee on
Education and Labor.
"I do mean to say that, most em
phatically," answered Downey, "and I
am not making the statement from
hearsay. It has cost me $500,000 in the
last five years, in addition to gray
hairs, to find it out. I spent $90,000 in
purchasing the best tools, in acquiring
knowledge of methods in .Glasgow, and
tried for three years to show American
workmen that by doing piece work they
could accomplish more. They would
not see it, and the shipbuilding inter
ests have suffered. In turn the laborers
have suffered, for the weekly payrolls
have decreased."
O'Connell declared he had no belief
in the statement of Downey, and ex
pressed the opinion that American
workers in the shipyards were far su
perior to those of other countries.
Downey responded with a challenge
that O'Connell make an investigation
or consult -other- builders, whose word
would be accepted by the world. He
said that he hoped that when the sys
tems employed in English yards are
brought to bear in this- country we
would be able to pass the foreign yards
in the amount and- quality of work pro
duced, but declared that such legisla
tion as is proposed in the eight-hour
bill is cutting the throats of the work-
Ing people.
"Our profits in the foreign trade,"
said Downey, "are balancing on the
line of 1, 2 or 3 per cent, ready every
minute to bo toppled over by the move
ment of the hand. The manufacturing
industry of this country has developed
far in excess of our consumption, and
therefore we need the foreign trade in
order to exist. The laborer needs it as
much as the manufacturer. I am not a
calamity howler, but I believe the pres
ent period of unprecedented prosperity
is nearly at an end and the country will
nettle down to something like a reason
able basis. It is then that the working
men will have to put their heads with
ours and be willing to do a part of the
calculating in keeping our thousands of
mills and factories in operation." '*.
Other employers ', protested against
the proposed legislation. -Another hear
ing will be held on Thursday next.

just Informed me that a ship's bell or
a punchbowl would be much more suit

SAVES TEACHER
FROM DISMISSAL
Board of Education Exonerates Mrs.
. Iredale From Charge of Falsely
Getting Absence Leave.
Mrs. Charles Winslow Iredale, a
teacher in the School Department,'
who was cited to appear before the
Board of Education and show cause
why she should not be dismissed from
her position for having secured- a
year's leave of absence on the plea of
illness and thent getting married, ef
fectually cleared herself of any inten
.tiOn to obtain the leave under false
pretenses at yesterday's meeting of the
board. .
Mrs. Iredale, who was formerly Miss
E. N. Booth, was accompanied by her
attorney, Stephen V. Costello, w,ho

last January. In fact, she . had sig
nified her desire to take a much need
ed rest as far back as last October, but
her principal, Jamds H. Simmons of
the Horace Mann School, had asked
her . to postpone her application, as
there were already three substitutes
in the school. Mrs. Iredale produced'
a physician's certificate showing that
she is run down in health and the
board expressed itself as satisfied with
her explanation.
In clearing Mrs. Iredale of the
charge the board did not commit itself
to restore the lady to her position
should she return at the end of the
year for duty. The board adopted a
resolution exonerating Mrs. Iredale
from the allegation of obtaining her
leave through misrepresentation.

OTTO SPAMER
PLEASES WELL
HIS AUDIENCE
Otto Spamer, who gave the first of a
series of four violin recitals at Century
Hall last night, was fortunate in a
large and representative audience. The
violinist, who made a seintillant sort of
debut with the* Scheel symphony or
chestra this season, has evidently es
tablished himself as a favorite. Mr.
Spamer's chief assets are a very nimble
left hand, a facile bow and quick ear,,
that he has learned to use very cleverly,
if not at all greatly. But Mr. Spamer has
his moments. The Bach "Sarabande,"
given last night, showed the violinist
with , a (to me) quite unexpected
breadth, and there were passages in the
Beethoven concerto (D major) â in the
larghetto more particularly â that were
toned and shaded with considerable
beauty and full authority. But it is
still possible to suspect Mr. Spamer of
youthâ though, like Pitt, he may mend
on't. His style, lacks, consistency, his
renderings authority. One feels that he
does not yet quite know what he wants
or what the composer desires. ,But the

EDMOND DE LABROUSSE MUST SPEND
REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE IN PRISON
Jury Fails to Consider the Plea of Insanity Advanced by the
Man Who Murdered Miss Marie Jordan last September-- Wails
of Weeping Mother and Sisters Fill trje Crowded Courtroom
SCENE SHOWING THE MURDERER OF MARIE JORDAN AND HIS
MOTHER AND SISTER AS THEY SAT IN JUDGE DUNNES
COURTROOM YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.
VERDICT OF LABROUSSE JURY
We. tbe jury, find the defendant, Edmond dc I^abrouvse, guilty
of murder in the first degree and fix the penalty at imprisonment in
the State prison for life.
Edmond de Labrousse must spend the
remainder of his life in prison for the
murder of Miss Marie Jordan on Sep
tember 29 last. Such was the decree of
the jury that has been trying the case
for the" past eight days in Superior
Judge Dunne's court. It was just 9
o'clock last evening when the jurors en
tered the courtroom, and as they took
their seats the giant clock in the tower
of the Hall of Justice pealed forth the
hour. In the silence of the courtroom
the big bell seemed to be tolling the
death knell of the murderer, who sat
with his face in his hands awaiting the
verdict.
When M. J. Balfe. the foreman, rose
to read the verdict he turned his eyes
from the pitiful gaze of Labrousse's
weeping mother and two sisters. The
other jurors turned in their seats
nervously. "We, the the jury, find the
defendant. Edmond de Labrousse.
guilty of murder in the first degree and
fix the penalty at imprisonment;' In the
State prison for life," read Balfe. Noth
ing but the sobs of the broken-hearted
mother and sisters for a moment broke
the silence. Then the assembled motley
crowd seemed to give its approval of
the verdict with a low hum of excited
voices.
The murderer did not evince any emo
tion. With his chin in his hands
he sat apparently oblivious of the
fact that he had just received a-sen
tence of isolation from the world. De La
brousse had nothing to say in regard to
the verdict, and was led from the
courtroom by detectives and conveyed
to the County Jail. The date of his
sentence has been fixed for March S. â¢
The jury received its instructions at
4:40 o'clock and was out just three
hours and twenty minutes. On the first
ballot the vote stood nine to three for
hanging, all of the jurors being firmly
convinced that the murderer was not
insane at the time he killed Marie Jor
dan. The three held out for life impris
onment and eucceeded in- bringing: the
rest of the jury to that verdict.
Yesterday was the eighth day of the
trial. At the completion of the argu
ments by Attorney William H. Alford
for the defendant and District Attorney
Byington for the prosecution Judge
Dunne pave the jury its instructions.
Attorney Alford pleaded the insanity
of his client at the time.of the perpetra
tion of the murder, and went over the
evidence submitted in behalf of the
prisoner to shov, 1 that De Labrousse
was of unsound mind prior to and at
the lime of the commission of 'the
crime.
He argued that there had been no
provocation and no cause for the deed,
but that it was the act of one whose
reason had been unbalanced through
business reverses and the loss of the
object of his affection. After a man's
reason had flown neither the law, nor
the Jury, nor God, he said, would hold
him responsible for his acts.
Attorney Alford desired to impress
upon the minds of the jury that in
sane men were capable of deliberation
and -were foxlike and cunning, and
their plans seemed to be perfectly rea
sonable.
ARGU-MEXT AS TO SANITY.
In reviewing the -testimony given by
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY, FEBRUARY. â  26. 1904.
the numerous witnesses for the prose
cution he paid a high compliment to
Detective Reynolds for the able man
ner he had worked on the case for the
people, yet he insisted that the prose
cutloti. with all the advantages at its
command, had not proved that the pris
oner was sane either before or at the
time of the murder.
District Attorney Byington argued
that the prisoner was perfectly sane
when he sent the three fatal shots into
the body of Miss Jordan. He was sane
enough to kill her first, said the Dis
trict Attorney, and to then deliberately
prepare the pistol to turn upon himself.
He was sane enough, before Jeaving the
house to meet his victim, to give hia
landlady a package and a letter for
his friend Feret and to shake hands
and bid Mrs. Mullaly, his landlady,
good-by. Every act that morning, de
clared the District Attorney, was con
secutive and not the pjan of one de
void of reason or one not knowing right
from wrong. ,
It was remarkable, he said, that the
prisoners wrote three letters, yet never
a word of farewell did he indite to
the woman he professed to love; not
a line to bid her farewell upon his de
cision to commit suicide.
In every case of intending suicide
where a love affair existed the one
about to take his or her life has left
a farewell iine to the one loved. This
in itself showed that De Labrousse,
while he Intended to take his own life,
also planned that Miss Jordan should
die with him. His enmity for the Jor
dan family, said District Attorney By
ington, caused him to resolve that he
would kill her on the very threshold of
the home of her mother and sister.
WAS DELIBERATE MURDER.
If the perpetrator of that cold-blooded
murder, he said, was deserving of pity
at the hands of the jury, then it was
time, indeed, that we close the courts
of justice. It was as deliberate a mur
der as any that had -occurred in the
city and county.
Reference was made by the District
Attorney to the great number of wit
nesses from the Central Emergency
Hospital, including doctors and nurses
and the numerous policemen who sat
by the prisoner's bedside, who all testi
fied to his being rational. If acquitted
the District Attorney declared such a
verdict would be a blot on the Jury
system of this State and the jury sys
tem of the nation. He asked for a ver
dict' of murder in the first degree.
Judge Dunne instructed the jury on
the law as it touched upon insanity
saying that if they thought the pris
oner insane at the time of the com
mission of the murder he could not be
convicted of a crime. He told the. jury
what constituted murder in the first
degree, which required that it must
be premeditated, and also instructed
them on the law of. manslaughter,
when life was taken in the heat of
passion and without malice afore
thought. Judge Dunne said that the
defense of insanity must be proved by
the defendant by. a preponderance of
evidence showing that he was insane
at the time of the act.

Father 31artin Serge ofSau
salito, While Walking to
His Home, Is Shot at Twice
SAUSALITO. Feb. 25.â From facts
brought to light to-day it is now be
lieved that Hooper and Carson were not
the only highwaymen at work in this
county. On Sunday night Rev. Father
Martin Serge, while walking Ijome from
the late ferry-boat, was shot at twice.
The matter has been kept very quiet
by the authorities, but to-day when it
leaked out Father Serge had the fol
lowing story to relate:
"I returned home from San Francisco
on the S:45 ferry-boat. Arriving at
Sausalito about 9:30 and not finding a
hack I started to walk home. When
I came opposite the Hearst place I
noticed two men across the street.
When I had walked some distance they
crossed the street -and followed me.
One was tall and the other mucii
shorter. Knowing of the hold-up the
Friday night previous in this city I
believed the men were following idk
When I arrived near a pile of rocks
alongside the road I stopped and hid
behind them. The men stopped also
and in a few seconds fired two shots
in my direction and then turned and
ran in the opposite direction."
Father Serge is a newcomer to Sau
salito. He recently returned from
China after a residence there of eight
een years.
Colossal Figures in Life Insurance.
.The Metropolitan Life puts forth a statement
in to-day's Call of Its business In 1003, pre
senting an array of figures that shows Im
pressively the Intimate relations between this
institution, and the whole people. In one item
alone an amazinc fact is stated. It Is that
Eivinc the number of policies in force on the
last day of the year â more than 7,500,000
showing that one person in every ten of the
entire population of the . United States is In
sured In this company. :
This company has paid to and invested for
its policy holders since organization over $i3s -
000,000â a sum that will impress the average
reader merely as being vast and very vague.
During 1903 the amount thus distributed among
policy holders averaged $Â»y a minute during
every working day of the year.
Every day In the year S5U claims were paid:
every day In the year more than (WOO new pol
icies were written. At the end of every day in
the year the company's assets were more than
$oO,000 greater than in the morning, its total
assets at the end of the year were more than
$HK>,oCO,O0O. Its total income for the one year
l!)03 wai over $40,000,000.
Nothing could show more plainly what life
Insurance really stands for In the minds of the
people. It is not regarded as a speculative
venture, but a sure promise of security; a safe
shelter when financial storm clouds threaten
general wreck.
A concern like the Metropolitan Life Insur
ance Company is, of course., a business or
ganization. b--t it Is one in which all of Its
policy holders are bona fide partners, "a com
pany of the people, by the people and for the
people"; one that has known how to gain and
how to Justify the confidence of the whole
community.- ' -

Farmers Feel Great Relief

Several Small Bridges and

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARYSVILLE, Feb. 25.â The Tuba
River pa'ssAT the twenty-foot mark this
morning and the great levees sur
rounding the city of Marysville proved
good and true. The feeling of danger
that prevailed last night has passed
away and the merchants are restoring
goods to their former positions on the
first floor. The water *stlll continues
high, but both rivers are falling slowly.
The country on all sides is flooded and
some damage to crops and livestock
has resulted. No trains have reached
Marysville to-day. Five hundred feet
of the railroad embankment has gone
out between this city and Reeds sta
tion on the south. Train service will
be resumed Friday if the water re
cedes. The present rain and flood water
has eclipsed all former records.
COLFAX, Feb. 25.â Owing to heavy
rains for a week past the North Fork
of the American River is higher than it
has been for five years. Much damage
is being done mining property along
the river, the Sacramento Mining and
Dredging Company being perhaps the
heaviest loser. Although prepared for
floods, such a great rise in the river
was not expected.
The first serious loss was the burst
ing of a dam which had been built at
heavy expense. Immediately following
this a great quantity of lumber was
swept away, the booms restraining it
being snapped. Next to fall into the
rushing waters was a dredging outfit.
Great quantities of debris, trees and
logs helped the work of ruin. For a
time the Iowa Hill suspension bridge
was threatened, but only the smaller
cables were broken by wreckage strik
ing them.
BIGGS, Feb. 25.â At 2 o'clock this
morning half the residence portion of
Biggs was covered with water from a
depth of a few inches to several feet.
Many dwellings and barns were sur
rounded by water and in a few In
stances the water ran into the houses
and families were, moved out. Looking
toward Gridley and Marysville in the
south as far as the eye could reach at
dawn appeared an open sea. The high
water was caused by an overflow of the
Feather River. All orchard lands on
Rio Bonito cast of town were sub
merged to a depth of from one to five
feet. The water commenced receding a
few hours later.
STOCKTON, Feb. 25.â The streams
in the vicinity of Stockton are not dan
gerously full and the water is fast fall
ing. .Out at Woodbridge, in the north
ern section of the county, the levees on
the Mokelumne River broke to-day and
the water is pouring over the grain
lands, but it is not believed the damage
will be heavy, as cross-levees will turn
the water into the falling streams.
MILTON, Feb. 25.â One and twenty
hundredths inches of rain fell here dur
ing the storm, making a total of 11.34
inches for the season, which is well in
advance of the record for the corre
sponding time last season. The moun
tain streams are nearly impassable, but
the waters are subsiding.
GREENVILLE, Feb. 25.â A warm
rain falling on the snow for three days
'resulted last night in the highest water
known in Plumas River in many
years. Stage communication with ad
joining towns was cut off and the re
sumption of mail service is indefinite.
No accidents were reported. The dam
age to roads and bridges is probably
great.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Feb. 25.â A gen
tle rain began falling here last night
and continued until after daylight: .25
of an inch fell. The northern part of
the county got about half an inch. The
total rainfall for the season is 6.69
inches.

Charles Wardrip, the murderer of
Hugh Duffy at Sacramento, will ex

10:30 o'clock. Wardrip was taken
jnto the death chamber last Monday.
He is the first man of the thirty-four

Wardrip will be the youngest man ever
executed in San Quentin. He is 20 years

SAN JOSE, Feb. 25. â Clarence V.
Hatfleld, an inmate of Agnew Insane
Asylum, died while kneeling: in prayer
at the side of his bed some time last
night. He was found in this position
by an attendant shortly after 1 o'clock
this morning. So lifelike was the po

dead. After trying to rouse him one
of the physicians was called, who dis

Hatneld had been at the asylum
about a month, having been commit

SODDEN DEATH
At the 3Iinnie Jlealey Mine,
Near Butte, Cave-In Ends
the Lives of Five Workmen
EXPECTED AN ACCIDENT
At Time Calamity Occurred
Men Were Strengthening
the Reported Weak Spot
BUTTE, Mont.. Feb. 25.â Five lives
â¢were lost by a cave-in of earth and
rock In the famous Minnie Healey mine
this afternoon. The dead:
THOMAS HAGGERTY. shift boas.
THOMAS FURLONG, miner.
WILLIAM DWYER, miner.
IKE ABRAHAM, miner.
ANTON TR1NETTI, miner.
The accident occurred on the sixth
floor of the 1000-foot level. Early In
the day the foreman vras Informed that
The ground 5n that place was very soft
and in danger of falling. He withdrew
all the miners who were working there.
This afternoon Shift Boss Haggerty
took Furlong. Dwyer, Abraham and
Trinetti into the place to bulkhead and
otherwise strengthen it-
Just how the fall came will never
be known, as not one of the five men
-was left to toll the tale. The noises
of the fall were heard in other portions
of the mine. Work was at once sus
pended and every one went to the res
cue.
The bodies of Happrerty and Trinetti
were brought to the surface early this
evening, but it is likely to be several
days before the other victims are
found. . . ,
The Minnie Healey mine is being
worked by the Montana Ore Purchas
ing Company. It is the property that
became celebrated because of the great
legal battle for the ownership, which
Just at present rests with the Montana
Ore Purchasing Company.
Furlong's body was recovered to
night. It is now reported that Tom
Powers, another miner, is missing and
mav be under the earth and rock.

SUMMARY OF THE WAR NEWS CONTAINED IN THE CALL'S ADVICES
A Japanese force Jias landed at Possiet Ray and marched inland toward Kirin. The Russian Government, bureau, is said to have left Vladivostok ami
gone to Khabarovsk. The Japanese invasion of Northern Manchuria-is intended as. a flank movement to cut off Russia's base of supplies.
Japanese armies are gathering rapidly in Northern Korea, while a strong Russian force is bting concentrated in that region, and 9evere fighting is expected.
A tremendous cannonade. from the""Russian land batteries and warships was concentrated on the Japanese vessels that sought to block the channel at Port Ar-
v thur. Following the futile attempt to block the channel, the Japanese fleet is rqx>rted to have renewed the bombardment of Port Arthur. Official advices from Vice
roy Alexieff's chief of staff and cablegrams from other sources report that the attack was brilliantly repulsed. Port Arthur refugees arriving at Chefu declare
that the Russians sank several of the attacking warships, but there is no^official confirmation of their statements.
Relations between the United States and Russia are strained. Russians have begun a boycott of American goods,. and our trade has already suffered to
such an extent that the American commercial houses in Russia have called the matter to the attention of United States Consuls.
News dispatches from British sources charge the Russians, with having massacred Chinese natives, including Women, and with- having murdered Japanese
refugees. Previous accusations of the same nature were, proved groundless. -
Two immense shipments of beef from San Francisco for. the Rursian army have fallen into the hands of the Japanese. The local firm having the contract
for the supplies has canceled a third _ shipment after the' beef was loaded aboard a steamship.
Foreign diplomats in St. Petersburg believe that a secret â â understanding exists between the Czar and the Kaiser, and the fear that all Europe will eventually
Japanese Will Invade Manchuria.
Continued From Page 1, Columns 2 and 3.
Standard sends in a report from a native source that the Rus- <
sians have burned a large village near "the Sungari River and ,
massacred the inhabitants, including the women, in revenge for '
an attempt to wreck the Sungari bridge.
PEKING, Feb. 25.â The Director General of Railroads re- /
ports. that ioo Russian infantrymen, an officer, a gun and a
large supply of ammunition are at Yaoyangho, and that 200
Russian cavalrymen and.t\\o guns have arrived at Luilichang.
These towns are both on the west side of the Liao River. The.
Director General reports that the Manchurian Railroad is guard
ed by detachments of Cossacks of thirty men each, who occupy
high watch towers at intervals of a mile.
The force landed at Possiet Bay flanks the main Russian army on the
Yalu, threatens Vladivostok and is in a position to dash for Klrln and Har
bin, cutting all communications and isolating the Russian troops in Man
churia from their base of supplies.
Colonel Oka of the Japanese general staff, in a recent interview with The
Call correspondent Jn New York, declared that the dash for Harbin and
Northern Manchuria would be one of the first moves of the campaign.
"Harbin," said the colonel, "is the key to the strategic situation. Rus
sia, with her troops scattered all over Manchuria, with big garrisons at
Port Arthur, Mukden, Newchwang and Vladivostok, would, we consider,
puffer by her decentralization. We think that by a great effort and much
self-sacrifice on the part of our troops, a rush upon Harbin, with its im
mense stores of ammunition, forage and provisions, would be a success.
"Once in occupation, we should hold the line at a vital point. To the
south would be Port Arthur and Dalny, cut off from their lines of commu
nication. Both places would be at the risk of assault by the Japanese navy
outside and the Japanese army on the land side. To raise the siege the gar
rison would have to come out and fight in the open."
Kirin is some 200 miles from Hunchun, however, and campaigning in
Northern Manchuria in February is no pleasant undertaking. The v ther
mometer rarely goes above zero during the winter in those latitudes. It is
possible the Japanese movement is intended to flank the Russian position
on the Yalu.

ance Monday evening at the Audito

arrange for the return of the prima

the 'cellist, sued the company for $25,
000 damages after he was discharged in
San Francisco. The Philadelphia con
cert was given up because in that way
the money paid for tickets still be
longed to the public and could not be
attached. It is nonsense to say that
Mme. Patti has decided to give up her
tour on account of this Incident. It was
an unfortunate affair, but we do not
look for further trouble." â¢
LAPSING OF ISLE OF PINES
TREATY DUE TO OVERSIGHT
Time Limit for Ratification of Con
vention Expires Before Ofiiclals
Realize. Long Delay.
HAVANA, Feb. 25.â The lapsing of
the Isle of Pines treaty on account of
its not being ratified within the time
limit is regarded here^ to be mainly
due to the fact that the State Depart
ment at Washington did not call at
tention to the matter. It would also
appear, however, that the Cuban Stat^
Department failed to remember this
time limit. The. treaty was signed in
Havana. July 2. 1903, and was ratified
by the Cuban Senate on July 16, since
when it has tieen pending in the United
States Senate. The last condition of
the treaty was to the effect that the
ratification should be exchanged In
Washington within seven months of the
date of signing.
Persons interested in securing Amer
ican sovereignty for the Isle of Pines
are jubilant over the lapse, considering
it to be a setback which gives promise
of the defeat of the proposition that
the island remains under Cuban sov
ereignty.

NEW YORK, Feb. 25. â Leopold

colonel on the staff of the late Gov
ernor Altgeld of Illinois and served as

ficials of the Japanese Government
here have repeatedly stated the coun
try's laws do not permit the service of

Cancel Shipment
of Beef for the
Russians.
'After loading about a million pounds
of mess beef aboard the Pacific Mail
steamship China, scheduled to start
for the Orient to-day, Getz Bros., pro
vision exporters; of this city, changed
their mind last evening and ordered
the meat returned to the dock. The
work of unloading will delay the' ves-.
sel's departure until 1 o'clock to-mor
row afternoon, as the. barrels contain
ing the beef are stowed deep in various
parts of the hold.
It was the capture of two previous
consignments of the same , kind of
freight by the Japanese Government
that caused the consignors to alter
their plans. The beef is the third and
last shipment intended for consump
tion by the Russian troops in the
Orient. The; first one was seized aboard
the Coptic at Nagasaki, and the second
one met a similar fate aboard the,Ko
rea. So, after considering the chances
of getting - the t third one through
aboard the ; China, the consignors de
cided that' they were not worth taking,
as the Japanese naval authorities evi
dently were cognizant of the contract
when it was effected and of how arid
when it was proposed to transport the
beef to its destination. â¢:
Louis Getz last evening said that ho
was not prepared to reveal his firm's
plans with regard to the meat recalled
from the China.
"The Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany was willing enough to take the
consignment," he said, "but after what
occurred to our preceding shipments
we decided it would be unsafe to at
tempt a third one via the same route.
Just now we do not care to disclose
what we intend to do with the beef."
Getz Bros, obtained the Russian
Government's order for 3,000,000 pounds
of mess beef through their branch
house at Shanghai. - and it ' was a
"rush" order. Kansas City and Omaha
packing-houses were called upon to
fill the contract, and the first special
trainload of meat arrived here in time
for shipment on the Coptic, which
sailed on January 15. The steamship
was overhauled at Nagasaki and the
meat was confiscated. A similar fate
befell the second shipment, \vhich left
here on February 2 on the Korea. Both
consignments were billed through to
Vladivostok.
It was rumored last evening that
Getz Bros, had chartered a sailing ves
sel to attempt to run the guantlet of
Japanese warships that is hovering
off Vladivostok, but no authentic
confirmation of the report could be ob
tained. It Is likely that whatever is
done in the way of getting the beef to
its ultimate destination will be done
very quietly, as the Japanese'Govern
ment evidently is keeping itself in
formed, through its agents in this coun
try, of the enemy's plans^ to plenish
its commissiarat;
Correspondents Go to the Orient.
Paul Cowles, who for a number of

this the Japanese evidently attempted to destroy the arsenal.
Several guards were killed b\ bursting shells. The civilians
took refuge in the new part of Port Arthur.
Circulars from Russian sources have been printed in the Chinese
language and distributed . here", belittling the successes of the Japanese
and exaggerating those of the Russians. It is stated on the authorty of
those close to the Chinese that at the first success of the Japanese army
the Chinese will join the Japanese, with the hope of driving all for

TOKIO, Feb. 25. â The secretary of the Norwegian Consulate at Kobe
has gone to Sasebo to see the captain of the captured ship Hoiks. This
action is not understood and it has given rise to speculation.
The views expressed by Emperor William of Germany before and after
the beginning of the war, which are characterized here as broad and dis
interested, have created a favorable impression and are tending to re
move the prejudice which at one time existed against him.
PEKING, Feb. 25. â Private advices received here from Newchwang
confirm the reports of the ill-treatment of Japanese refugees at the
hands of the Russians while they were journeying through Manchuria,
and declare, moreover, that some of the refugees were without- doubt
cruelly murdered. The Russian soldiery at Newchwang is so undis
ciplined that the place is unfit for European women.

Two lives and possibly a third were
lqst in a fire that broke out early this
morning and threatened the entire
business section of the city.
The dead are:
MAUD LOTVRY, a 15-year-old girl.
MICHAEL McGUIRE, a laborer.
The girl perished in her room, her
mother escaping by jumping from a
window. The remains of McGuire were
found in the debris lodged between the
timbers of the two buildings that had
been burned. The loss in property is
$40,000. Three buildings were destroyed.
Three horses were burned to death in
their" stalls and three others had to be
shot.
The fire is supposed to have been
started by tramps striking matches in
a livery stable, adjoining a rooming
house on the corner of Cascada avenue
and Huerfano street. The wind fanned
the flames to the other buildings* and
the entire fire department was called
out. For a time it appeared that a
large section of the business district
would be swept away, but the flames
were finally brought under control.

CASE A NOTABLE ONE
Defense. After Trial Lasting
Three Weeks, Proves Non-
Kesponsibility of Prisoner
SAN BERNARDINO, Feb. 25.â A
jury to-night brought in a verdict ac
quitting William L. Miller of* the mur

October 15 last. The defense was in
sanity. The trial lasted three weeks,
and was the most notable criminal
case^ in the annals of the county.
Simmons was a wealthy mine owner
against whom Miller conceived enmity
on account of the latter's supposed in
terest in mining properties of the for
mer. Testimony at the trial showed
that Miller never had any actual inter
est in the property, and this furnished
the basis of the insanity theory of the
defense.

Growing Hatred of
the United
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 25.â The Ir
ritation against the United States on
account of the supposed unfriendly at
titude of that country' toward Russia,
â which was slightly noticeable through
out the negotiations, seems to have be
come daily more pronounced and. since
the Vicksburg incident at Chemulpo
(when the commander of this American
gunboat is said to have refused to
unite with the commanders of other
foreign warships at Chemulpo to pro
test against the fighting which resulted
in the loss of Russian warships Variax
and Koreitz, and the fact that the
Vicksburg did' not take on board sur
vivors of the Russian ships), American
business men here are really concerned
about the possible effect upon Amer
ican trade. Within the last few days
Orders for American goods have been
countermanded, the only explanation
Siren being that prospective pur
chasers did not desire to buy American
goods under the present circumstances.
United States Consul General Watts
hits been appealed to in the case of an
American firm which had a large con
tract for school supplies, tie contract
having beÂ«.n peremptorily canceled.
Orders for the importation of a bic
consignment of wood pulp also have
been countermanded, the intending: pur
chaser saying in his letter that he
could not be expected to do business
with America after the VicksbUTK in
cident- Watts has felt it t<Â» be his dutv
to write to the State Department,
pointing out the state of public feel
ing: here, and the great; prospective
damage to American Trade unless
measures are taken to alliy the Irrita
tion.
Americans here believe that an of
ficial explanation of the Vicksbure in
cident would be opportune and have an
excellent effect. The Government of
ficially has not taken notice of the in
cident, being without direct official ad
vices from the Far East on the sub
ject. In Government circles, however
it is seen plainly that Russian sus
ceptibilities have been wminded. and
the fear is expressed that should Wash
ington now disregard Russia and pro
cure exequaturs for the newly ap
pointed American Consuls at Mukden
and Antung from Peking and attempt
to send those officials to their posts, a
really unpleasant incident misrht be
created.
Russia does not want to be placed in
the position of refusing to allow these
Consuls to Â«=nter upon their duties, but.
with a state of war existing and com
merce at" a standstill, military consid
erations' are paramount and Russia
might consider herself warranted in In
terpretfnjr such a course on the Dart
"f the United States to be political
rather than commercial.
The refusal of Russia to allow Mor
gan, the newly appointed American
Consul at Port Dalny. to go to his post
at present is based solely on the mili
tary Fituation. which may compel all
foreigners to leave Port Dalny. The
sincere hope is expressed that the
United States will not embarass Russia
further by pressing the question of
consular representation at this time.

American Consuls
to Manchuria
Are Here.
James Wheeler Davidson of Austin.
Minn., the newly appointed United
States Consul to Antung. Manchuria,
arrived at the Palace last evening and
will leave on the steamship China to
day for his far away post. Consul
Davidson was selected for his future
position by reason of his previous ex
perience in the consular service, he
having held a position of a similar ca
pacity in Formosa under an appoint
ment by former President Cleveland.
Upon all matters of a political char
actex he declined last evening to enter
into a discussion, but during a talk
concerning the country for which he
is now bound he gave information that
clearly showed that he was thoroughly
acquainted with the situation in Man
churia and well understood just how
far the Russians had encroached on
Chinese territory" * and exactly what
their occupation of that territory meant
to the United States and other foreign
nations, from a commercial standpoint.
"Antung is the most important ship
ping point on the Yalu River," said
he. "It is situated on the banks of
the Yalu. directly opposite Wiju,
Korea, which was recently made an
open port under a treaty. The popula
tion of Antung is 15,000 and it has a
floating population â that is, people who
live in boats â of about 12,000. Its Junk
and shipping business is bo extensive
that frequently you can find between
400 and 500 small boats along its water
front. There have been stationed there
for a long period many Russians, who
own and operate a large lumber com
pany about eight miles below Antung.
which is known as Yongarnpho. The
latter place is the scene of Russian ac
tivity, they having been cutting the
forest along the river banks. Steam
ships drawing from 6 to 8 feet of water
can reach Antung at high tide and
when I was last there there was a line
of small steamships running between
Ant,ung and Chefu and another, from
Antung to Port Arthur. There are no
foreign buildings there, and in view
of that fact the Chinese Minister at
Washington recently sent a communi
cation to the Chinese officials of the
town to place a temple at my disposal
until a consulate and other buildings
necessary for the accommodation of
myself, the Vice Consul and our staff
can be constructed. The Vice Consul,
by the way. is Mr. Clough of Iowa,
who has been attached to the United
States legation at Peking as student
interpreter." â¢
That the authorities in Washington
long had jn view a position of respon
sibility for Davidson in Manchuria is
plainly suggested in the fact that last
August he was suddenly relieved from
his consular post in Formosa and
started immediately for Manchuria,
where he proceeded to inspect all the
towns, their connections and the roads
and other improvements then being
made by the Russian Government.
After this t^Jp Davidson returned to
Washington, presumably to make a full
report, and the next heard of him was
when his appointment as Consul to
Antung was announced. In speaking
of his four months* trip through Man
churia Davidson said last evening:
"When I Journeyed through Manchu
ria the Russians were in occupation of
all the towns on and off the Manchu
rian branch of the trans-Siberian rail
road, but they had not at that time
constructed permanent buildings at any
point off the railroad line. They had
done a great deal of improvement in
the different towns, especially in the
way of sanitation, lighting the streets
and building roads. There have been
frequent ; reports circulated in this
country regarding the flimsy condition
of the Manchurian railroad, but these
stories are not correct. The Russians
laid ?2-pound rails, constructed their
bridges of steel and threw up a roadbed
that is equal to many of the roadbeds
of the Western roads in this country.
The road is capable of handling heavy
traffic, and when I was in Manchuria
thirty trains were daily running in and
out of Harbin. The passenger traffic
was so large that the railroad company
could hardly handle it. It is very prob
able that the frequent reports regard
ing the poor condition of the main line
of the trans-Siberian road have con
fused people, who think that the Man
churian branch is in a' similar condi
tion." :
Consul Davidson, while comparative
ly a young man. has'had many varied
experiences abroad. He is a graduate
of the Northwestern Military Academy
of Highland, 111. In 1893-4 he was a
member of the Peary Arctic expedition
to North Greenland, and later served as
a war correspondent . in .the ' Japanese-
Chinese war. He was also connected
with. the Bptel Tobago exploring party.
"While in Formosa, where he first served
as a special correspondent, he received
the decoration of the Rising Sun from
the Emperor of Japan for services ren-

RUSSIAX TROOPS LEAVING FOR THE SCENE OF WAR IN THE FAR EAST.
Landing of Japanese at Possiet Bay May Mean an
Attack Upon Vladivostok.
LONDON. Feb. 26. âWar correspond
ents and Europeans in ~ "Japans com
menting in amazement upon the suc
cess of Japanese officials in preserving
secrecy regarding all the operations of
war, declare that this "conspiracy of
silence" is not only confined to Gov
ernment and service circles, but that
it extends to every section of the com
munity. All classes of people are sub
mitting with marvelous patience to be
ing deprived of news, which they rec
ognize as imperative to the success of
the cause. It is undoubtedly In pur
suance of this policy that'no Japanese
account of the Port Arthur attacks has
yet been published, and none is ex
pected until Admiral Togo has com
pleted his designs there.
In the meantime. If the report from
Yinkow of a Japanese landing near
Vladivostok, which at present is based
on missionary and native statements,
should prove correct, a most Important
and new development in the Japanese
operations will have been revealed, as
it points to an attack on Vladivostok,
fro-m which Possiet Bay is only, a little
more than seventy miles distant. The
report that the railroad has been cut
between Harbin and Vladivostok may
possibly be connected with these ope
rations, but until reliable information
Is forthcoming this report must be re
ceived with reserve. It has already,
been reported from Tokio that certain
Russian forces were concentrating at
Possiet Bay.
No further details of the attack on
Port Arthur, after the engagement in
which the Japanese attempted to sink
vessels In such a manner as to block
the harbor entrance, has reached Lon
don, Almost all the English news
papers in discussing Viceroy's Alex
ieff's reports incline to the belief that
Admiral Togo succeeded, insofar as to
make the channel impassable for large
battleships, even if it Is still free to
smaller craft, and presume that the
reported second attack, if it did oc
cur, was devoted to an attempt to sink
further obstacles to navigation.
The Morning Post to-day, devotes a
long editorial article to a historical
record of the rapid growth of Amer
ican activity in Far Eastern affairs,
comparing the present attitude of the
United States with her passive interest
In the Chino-Japanese war. The
paper remarks on the.notable friend
ship with Russia and contends, that
American friendship for the empire
was always artificial. Admiral Dewey's
guns, the paper says, literally shat
tered the superstition that Russia was
the appointed friend and Great Brit

FRANCE AND GREAT
BRITAIN ADJUSTING
ALL DIFFEKENCES
LONDON. Feb. 25.â Premier Bal
four had sufficiently recovered his
health to come from Brighton to this
city to-day to preside at a Cabinet
meeting at noon. Prior to the meet
ing French Embassador Cambon call
ed at the Foreign Office and had an
hour's talk with Foreign Secretary
Lansdowne. The Embassador return-,
ed here from Paris yesterday evening
and apart from an' exchange of views
in regard to the most recent develop
ments of the war, on which subject
the .two Cabinets are keeping in the
closest touch with each other, there, is
good reason to believe that a settle
ment of all matters in disjfute between
France and Great Britain Is on the eve
of being arranged. Such questions as
Egypt; Morocco, Newfoundland, etc.,
have been fully discussed by the two
Governments for some monhts and
the difficulties are being gradually
eliminated, until practically nothing
remains to prevent an early signature
of a treaty removing all outstanding
obstacles to a complete accord between
the two powers.
Asked in the House of Commons to
day by. what authority it was proposed
to detain at Ceylon the 325 Russian
sailors rescued after the fight off
Chemulpo, Premier Balfour said the
Bailors had sought refuge on a British
warship. Under the circumstances
and until other arrangements had been
agreed upon the Government thought
it would be best fulfilling the obliga
tions of neutrality by holding the men
in British territory until the close of
the war. The Japanese Government,
however, had given intimation that it
was willing that the sailors should re
turn-to Russia on giving their parole
not to participate during the rest of
the war. The British Government was
now in correspondence .with. Russia
with the. view of settling the question
on this- basis. * *-.> â â¢Â« - .'^ t - 'â  â -.'. â ';,-

PORT ARTHUR ACCOUNT
OF -FUTILE ATTE3IPT
â TO BLOCK CHANNEL
PORT ARTHUR, Feb. 25.â At about
1 o'clock yesterday morning the Jap
anese made a desperate attempt to
block the entrance of the Inner harbor
and dock. With this 'object four mer
chant steamships, accompanied by tor
pedo vessels, were sent from two sides
toward the entrance of the channel.
The movement was perceived by the
Retvizan, which was lying in the chan
nel, and which opened fire upon them.
At the same time the guns of the forts
on the Tiger Peninsula, Golden Hill,
and Electric Gulf were turned upon
the enemy and a furious cannonade en
sued, lasting until 5 o'clock in the
morning. Then the firing slackened
and became desultory. The Japanese
had failed to effect their purpose.
All four steamships were sunk. They
are lyirjg In the following positions:
One behind Golden Hill, one near the
Retvizan and two between the entrance
of the channel and Laothieshan Penin
sula. Two of the vessels are still burn-
Ing. >-v
The cruisers Bayan and Novik pur
sued the Japanese torpedo flotilla. It
Is said, that one of the torpedo-boats
was sunk.
About 9 a. m. on February 24 a Jap
anese squadron of considerable size ap
proached Port Arthur and the Bayan
and; Novik were ordered to engage the
Japanese ships, which, however, did
not. open fire, and afterward steamed
away in the direction of Port Dalny.

POWERS MAY AGREE
Vtijm RUSSIAN A r IEW
AS TO KOREA'S STATUS
PARIS, Feb. 25.â It is the belief in
the- highest official quarters that the
powers will support. the .Russian view
of the invalidity of the Japanese treaty
with Korea as far as it creates a Japa
nese'protectorate over Korea, owing to
the Emperor being under duress. But
it-is said^that no Immediate action on
the; part .of the powers is required, as
the question of . the recognition of the
protectorate rwill definitely arise when
the terms of peace are considered.
In.the 'meantime official opinion is
strongly, sympathetic with Russia's po
sition, and It is considered that Rus
sia's, note ; ,to the powers protesting
against < Japan's violation of Korean

TOKIO, Fe.b. 25.-rrThe question of the
stay of the Russian gunboat Mandjur
at Shanghai remains unsettled. Paul
Lessar, Russian Minister to China, i3
said to be trying to intimidate the Chi
nese Government, declaring emphat
ically that Japan has little chance of
victory against a Russian army 500,000
men strong. The court at Peking Is
oscillating on this question. Russia
also is pressipg China to declare the
neutrality of that portion of the em
pire which Russia already occupies.
The Japanese Government to-day
paid the famous white whisky claim
by handing to United States Minister
Griscom a draft for % 115.000 in favor
of the American Trading Company.
The claim arose from a customs de
cision rendered in 1900 holding an im
portation of 8000 barrels of whisky to
be alcohol and increasing' the duty from
4ft per cent to 250 per cent. Japan at
first rejected the claim for repayment
of the amount alleged to have been
overcharged by the customs depart
ment, but Minister Griscom. on arriv
ing in Tokio, renewed it and pressed
the case with firmness. His success
in obtaining payment is very gratify
ing to American commercial men. anJ
the settlement of the case Is regarded
as another mark of the friendliness of
Japan for America.
Three weeks ago it was thought In
some quarters here that the opening
of the war would be quickly followed
by a movement of the Russian forces
toward the s,outh, Plngyang being
picked as their objective point. The
appearance later of Russian scouts ;n
the vicinity of Wlju tended to confirm
this opinion and created the Impres
sion that there would be a conflict in
that vicinity.
If the Russians ever intended to make
this movement they apparently have
been beaten by the rapidly moving
Japanese. The latter are said to have
a sufficient force to check the Rus
sians, thus insuring" the possession of
Korea as soon as they are capable of
maklng # an aggressive northern move
ment themselves. The small bodies of
mounted Russians who were scouting
south of the Yalu River speedily with
drew to the north.
Storms are interfering with naval
operations. The Tellow Sea. is belns
swept by gales, heavy snow is falling
and the weather is bitterly cold. Th^
forces of Japan are going to the front
splendidly equipped to withstand the
cold, but, despite their preparations,
both sides will suffer much during the
next sixty days.
BAI?0N SUYEMATSU
SAYS JAPAN'S FIGHT
IS FOR EXISTENCE
SEATTLE. Feb. 25.â Baron Suyemat
su arrived here to-day, a passenger of
the Iyo Maru, being en route to London
on an important diplomatic mission.
Discussing the war the Baron said:
. "It is for us a gigantic struggle and
one which we tried to avoid. But Japan
will send her-last man and will expend
her last dollar In order to win. We
have no aspirations for aggrandize
ment, but at the same time we must
look out to maintain our existence as a
nation. ; '. >:.,:.._ / K .
"We have large political and commer
cial interests as well as a sacred his
torical connection with the Korean pen
insula. If Korea falls into the hands
of any other nation it will be a death
blow to the existence of, our empire. We
respect the integrity and sovereignty
of Korea; we fought China ten years
ago solely for the independence of the
Korean kingdom. Now we are fighting
Russia for, the same principle, and more
âfor the integrity of China as well. If
Manchuria falls to Russia the question
of the existence of Korea would be one
of but a few. days. She would take Ko
rea, and that, would be a constant
menace. to our^empire."
INSPECTOR GENERAL

Kaiser and Czar
Have a Secret
Compact.
Russia May Block
Great Britain
in Tibet.
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 25.â It Is
now said the Russian Baltic squadron,
comprising eight battleships, two arm
ored cruisers, three protected cruisers.
two large transports and thirty tor
pedo-boats, will leave for the Far East
at the end of June. It la added that it
will be commanded by Rear Admiral
Rojestvensky.
There is a growing belief here that an
understanding exists between Russia
and Germany relative to the develop
ments from the war, and the diplomats
are giving more attention to the like
lihood of other powers becoming in
volved. France's enormous financial in
vestments in Russian funds and enter
prises are estimated at close to $2,000.
000,000, and It is feared that In case of
Russian reverses, which might threaten
the empire, France might be compelled
to go to the support of her ally.
There are suspicions of the motives ct
Great Britain here of a character to
cause complications in that direction.
It is strongly intimated that ths re
turn of the Russian Embassador to
Great Britain, Count Benckendorff, to
St. Petersburg was not solely to bid
farewell to his son previous to the lat
ter's departure for the Far East with
his regiment, but that it was also to
consult with the Russian Foreign Offlca
relative to the British expedition to
Tibet. â  iâ â¢'â 
ANGERED BY LANSDOWNE.
The Government Is angry at the lan
guage used by Foreign Minister Lans
downe as printed in the recent British
Blue Book on the subject of Tibet, ajad
Embassador Benckendorft may receive
instructions to reply in kind if ex
changes on the subject continue.
The conditions in the Balkans also
are considered extremely critical, and
altogether the diplomatic feeling is that
if the danger of a general conflagration
i* to be avoided every energy should be
directed not only to limiting the sphere
of operations, but toward an at'.impt
at mediation. The diplomatic corps is
discussing the subject with gr;at se
riousness.
It is not believed that Russia will
be disposed, while smarting under the
humiliation of defeat, to adopt media
tion, but once a decisive victory i3
achieved, the dlplbmats are inclined to
believe, owing to the Czar's sincere
aversion to war, he will welcome good
offices. â  _
The Novoe Vremya declares Great
Britain's failure to protest against the
violation of the neutrality of Korea,
whose inviolability was guaranteed by
the Anglo-Japanese treaty, proves that
the treaty was directed solely again3t
Russia.
VAST SUM FOR WAR CHEST.
Some old believers in the schis
matics of 300 years ago. who- are among
the wealthiest Russians, show a dispo
sition to place a vast sum at the dis
posal of the Government If the occa
sion requires. Among them are scores
of millionaires at Moscow, where they
enjoy valuable concessions granted by
Catherine the Great. As they are not
believers in banks the money would
have to come out of their private strong
boxes.
A special dispatch from Port Arthur
says Peking and Tientsin report that
there is considerable dissatisfaction in
certain Chinese circles at the neutral
ity of China, and that Japanese Min
ister Ouchida is trying to force China
to side with Japan. It is asserted that
Yuan Shih Kal, the Chinese commander
in chief, is under Japanese influence
and that he secretly recommended an
alliance between China and Japan, on
the ground that if Japan gets Korea
she would not take Manchuria.
Russia's views as to contraband or
war will shortly be laid before the pow
er?. The technical committee of the
Foreign Office, Is now considering the
subject.
REJOICING OVER VICTORY.
â Details of the unsuccessful attempt
of the Japanese to "bottle up" the Rus
sian fleet at Port Arthur by sinking
big merchantmen at the mouth of the
harbor indicate that the coup was
planned, according to the usual Jap
anese tactics, to take place during the
night; that it was desperately pushed
and backed by eight torpedo-boats,
which continued fighting until daylight.
Great praise is given to the Russian
battleship Retvizan, whlcn lay outside
the harbor entrance, for gallant work
in beating off the enemy. Her part in
the action shows that the reports of
the injuries which she is said to have
sustained in the attack of February 8
were grossly exaggerated.
The news of the Japanese repul93
was received here with great rejoicing
and was looked upon as partially wip
ing out the score against the enemy.
The Czar tfas telegraphed warm con
gratulations to Viceroy Alexleff and
the entire Russian squadron at Port
Arthur on the able manner in which
they repulsed the latest attack of the
Japanese.
MUST DOCK BATTLESHIPS.
The battleships Retvizan and Cesare
vitch will be temporarily employed at
Port Arthur as guardshlps. in which
capacity, It has been decided, their
formidable guns can be Utilized to good
advantage. It has been found that the
necessary repairs to these ships can
be fully made only in the dock at
Vladivostok, so the vessels will be tem
porarily patched up and remain at Port
Arthur until circumstances will oermlt
of their being sent to Vladivostok.
The rumors that the savings banks
will not meet the demands for payment
of deposits in consequence of the war
are emphatically denied by the Official
Messenger.
There is no truth in the rumor cur
rent here that the Russian embassy at
Washington will be entrusted to a
Charge d'Affaires as a sign of the dis
pleasure over the conduct of the com
mander of the United States gunboat
Vicksburg at Chemulpo in refusing to
join with the commanders of the other
foreign warships in the protest against
the attack by, the Japanese fleet on thÂ±
Russian cruisers Variag and Koreitz.
The Foreign Office declares that noth
ing of the sort is contemplated.

Scholarships Will Not Be

NEW REQUIREMENTS
All Candidates Must Pass
Oxford Responsions Before
They Will Bp Admitted
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, Feb. 25.
The qualifying examinations for the
Rhodes scholarships at Oxford will be
held later In the year than was at first
intended, according to a statement that
has just been issued by George R.
Parkin, the commissioner for the trus
tees of the Rhodes scholarship trust.
Instead of this or early next month
they will be held some time between
April 15 and May 1, the exact time not
yet having been decided upon.
There are one or two other require
ments for the scholarships that have
not yet been published, the result of a
recent ruling of the Rhodes trustees.
One of these is that the candidate ap
pointed from the United States must
pass the regular Oxford responsions be
fore he will be admitted to the uni
versity, even after he has passed the
examinations required by. the trustees.
The other is that either the whole
faculty or a committee appointed by
the faculty will elect the candidate in
stead of the president of the institu
tion from which the candidate comes.
The examinations are not to be com
petitive, but merely a test, in order to
make sure that the elected scholar will
be able to pass the responsionsâ the
matriculation examinations of that uni
versity and the lowest test required of
the lowest man who is allowed to con
tinue work at Oxford. This will be
merely 1 a check upon the qualifications
of candidates and all who pass will be
eligible for election by the means pro
vided in the district from which they
come.
The examination will be managed
from Oxford and immediately the ex
aminers have reported upon the can
didates who have passed this qualify
ing examination the list will be sent
to the university from which they ap
plied and from this qualified number
there are appointed what the university
considers its best and most represen
tative men, applying whatever test of
past work and future promise it sees
fit. A further examination will not
bâ¬ held unless the institution making
the appointment so determines, but
upon entering Oxford the candidate
muft pass the resnonslons.

REMOVE HATS
IN THE CHURCH
Women of First Congrega
tional Society Doff Their
Millinery During Services
THE REST WILL FOLLOW
Pastor Favors Such a Cus :
torn, Though He Makes Xo
Effort to Force His Views
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, Feb. 25.
A movement has been started among
the women of the First Congregational
Church of this city to have the mem
bers of their sex remove their hats in
church, and it is. probable that next
Sunday the ladies will remove their
headgear during divine worship.
." It gradually became known among a
few of the female worshipers at this
church that the pastor. Rev. Charles
R. Brown, was in favor of having the
elaborate hats of their sex removed
during service, and last Sunday a few
of them respected this wish. There
were not many, but few though the
number, there were enough to cause
some discussion of the matter at sev
eral of the female society meetings of
the church during the week.
The result was that the pastor was
appealed to, and while Dr. Brown re
fused to force his views upon the
women of his congregation, he ad
mitted that he thought the removal of
hats was desirable.
The question has been discussed
among the various societies of the
church and among many of the men
bers and it has been decided, without
any organized effort, to generally re
move the expansive pieces of millinery
during divine service.

of a former Sheriff of Aiameda Coun
ty, cashed a check with Jlollensteiner
on February. 13 for $100 on the Dono

tion. Adams paid no attention to the
letter land â¢ Hollensteiner : reconsidered
his intention not to' swear out a war
rant, which has now been issued.
DIVINE RIGHT
OF POLICEMEN
Dennis Welch of Alameda's
Force Claims That Bobbies
3Iust Be Permitted to Sleep
TO TEST CASE IN COURT
Has the Owner of. Pack of
Noisy Hounds Arrested for
Disturbing His Slumbers
ALAMEDA, Feb. 25.â Dennis Welch,
policeman of Aiameda, has done more
things that brought him notoriety than
any other member of the local force.
He has saved more people, got mixed
up with more electric wires, captured
more burglars, run in more small bovs
and got his name into print more times
than any other man in the Island Citv.
and now he comes to the front with a
defense in court of the right of a po
liceman to sleep, on or off of his beat.
Dennis says that it is the divine
right of the wearer of a blue uniform
and a star to be permitted to sleep at
all times, provided the sergeant does
not catch him or a pack of hounds
doesn't disturb him. As Aiameda is
not possessed of a sergeant whose duty
it is -.to see that policemen do not sleep
on their beats, and as there is a pack
of noisy hounds in Dennis' neighbor
hood, the veteran policeman had to
turn his attention to the hounds. It is
presumed from his statements that had
there been 3T sergeant to awaken him.
he would have met the same fate as
the dogs.
One Hans P. Nielsen, who comes
from the land of the Vikings, keeps a
pack of baying hounds near where the
policeman lives. According to the com
plaint made to-day by Welch, these
hounds have not permitted him to
sleep by day or night and the only rest
that he has had has been upon his
beat. Upon this showing Judge Tap
pan issued a warrant for Nielsen's ar
rest and he "was haled into court. He
demanded a .jury trial and will set up
as hts defense that Welch got enough
rest unon his beat to satisfy all of the
demands of nature, and that a police
man is supposed to be always vigilant
and awake. On the other hand it is
understood that DÂ«nnis will plead the
eight-hour law on sleep.

IF THE BLACKS SHOULD
RISE AGAINST EUROPEANS?
Negroes or Africa Vastly Outnumber
the Whites In Dark Conti
nent.
If the blacks should rise against Eu
ropeans? This sentence has not infre
quently been uttered and nervously
uttered in Africa. The whites on
that continent, even in Dutch
and English South Africa, are
in an absurd numerical minor
ity. In Cape Colony itself, the oldest
and best settled European province,
there are but ."S2.1PS whites to 2.113,137
blacks. No such disparity as this ex
ists in any part of our American
"black belt." In Rhodesia the whites
are but a handful among upward of
500,000 warlike blacks of the stronger
sort, including the ilerce Matabele. In
Natal there a/e 72,695 whites to 806.51-
Zulu-Kaffirs. In most of German Af
rica, and. of course, the whole of ths
continent northward to Algeria tha
disparity is greater still. In the Warm
bad district of German Southwest Af
rica, whence only yesterday we hÂ»d
news that another German outpost had
been overpowered and massacred, there
were at last accounts 1513 white per
sons, mostly Boers who have trekked
there, to 10,000 blacks.
Yesterday, too. we had news, as yet
unconfirmed, but very likely true, of
the massacre of a white missionary
and his community of eighteen con
verts in the hinterland of Liberia.
The scene of this deed is significant, if
the news is true, for if the black aval
anche is ever let loose in Africa it will
undoubtedly be by the hand of soms
black who has been inspired by
thoughts of black rule and independ
ence, such as those that prevail in Li
beria. Xo such native avalanche ever
hung over the heads of even the few
white settlers in the American colon
ies in the early day. for the American
wilderness was never peopled with
such hosts of savages as fill the Afri
can veldt and jungle.
For the attempt, at least, nothing i3
wanting but the Toussalnt l'Ouverture.
the determined and able black leader
who can organize the diverse and mu
tually foreien nations and tribes and
inspire them with a common motive of
revolt. No such leader is in sight. Yet
a negro King Philip, a negro Pontiar.
a negro Tecumseh. the stamp of whos<Â»
foot upon the earth may some day be
heard in the earthquake, is neither in
conceivable nor impossible.
We may understand the uneasiness
of South African whites over this Hot
tentot insurrection. German rule is
sufficiently oppressive _to light the
flame if anything will do It. The Hot
tentots are a widespread nation. A
general black insurrection must result
in horrible massacres. Yet there could
be but one final result for it, as there
was but one possible result for the gen
eral Indian wars in America. ThÂ»
thousands of whites, with their re
sources and organization, would pre
vail, and more sternly than ever
against the millions of blacks.â New

THE DESERT,

GERALDINE BONNER'S NEW
CALIFORNIA NOVEL, WHICH

The Popular
Vote of 1904
*s Unanimously in Favor of Stuart's
dyspepsia Tablets -They Are
the Nation's Favorite.
N*o article on the market, whatever
be the purpose for which it was
treated, can be a phenomenal success
and be universally popular unless it
possesses great and unfailing merit.
Inferior and worthless articles may
nourish for a limited time if their
praises are sung* by sufficient clever
and catchy advertising; but their days
are numbered from the start and their
finish is a foregone conclusion. This is
an age of the survival of the fittest,
and only articles of true worth endure.
The unparalleled and phenomenal
success of Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets
from a business standpoint is not un-
natural nor surprising. It is due di-
rectly to their unparalleled and phen-
omenal success in curing multiplied
thousands of cases of dyspepsia
throughout the English-speaking
world.
The reason of the wonderful success
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is so
plain and simple that a child can un-
derstand. It is this and nothing
more; they are natural in their work-
ings and effects. They take up the
work of the worn and wasted stomach
and do it just as the stomach did when
it was well and strong and able. They
actually digest the food and do it thor-
oughly, completely and independently,
thus giving the weak and weary
stomach an opportunity to renew and
reyain its wasted strength. You for-
get that you have a stomach just as
you did when you were a healthy boy
or girl and nature restores and heals
that organ and makes it well and
strong.
A t-u Louis business man says: "I
was a confirmed dyspeptic for years.
What I ate had to be forced down and
most of it soured or lay like lead In
my stomach and did me no good. I
was in constant misery both in mind
and body and came to be cranky,
morose and irritable. My natural dis-
position, which was cheerful and
j.leasant, left me and I was alienating
all my friends. The doctors did me no
{rood. 1 {,-ot so I hated the sight or
name of a doctor. My wife finally
worried me into buying a box of
Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets, which I
began taking under protest, as I had
no faith in anything or anybody. I
was sore on creation.
"I had not taken a third of that box
before I noticed a decided and most
welcome change. I could enjoy a good
meal and feel no bad effects following
it- I forgot my stomach and had a
chance to think about something else.
1 went ahead with my business in ease
.ind comfort. J?ix boxes of Stuart's
iJyspesia Tablets at a total outlay of
S3 cured me completely and I have
:iot suffered a pain from dyspepsia for
two years. I have an appetite like a
3 6-year-old boy. I wish every one
who suffers from dyspepsia could
know what a change this great remedy
made in me."
Stuart "s Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by druggists everywhere at 50
< fins a box. All druggists carry them
and the best doctors are prescribing
'hem. Yon need not fear that you will
ever be unable to get them; for, be-
<Â«use of the good they have done
mankind and the suffering they have
relieved and the happiness they have
caused, the fame and the success and
:he popularity of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets from generation unto genera-
tion will endure. %

CANAL TREATY
IS APPROVED
Ratifications Between the
United States and Panama
Signed by the President
TO ISSUE PE0CLA3IATI0N
Shaw Says Xo Money Will
Be Paid Until Question of
the Title Is Determined
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.â President
Roosevelt to-day signed the ratifica
tions to be exchanged between the
United States and the republic of Pan
ama of the isthmian canal treaty. The
exchanges will be made at the State
Department between Secretary Hay
and Bunau-Varilla. The President him
self does not sign a treaty. Subse
quently a proclamation will be issued
by the President announcing the con
clusion Â«jf the convention and putting
ii into effect.
NEW YORK. Feb. 25.â Secretary
Shaw was at the sub-treasury to-day,
where he received a number of callers,
including: E. U. Harrirrsan, I. N. Selig
man, James Stillman and Valentine P.
Snyder. Respecting the Panama canal
payment the Secretary said that no
call will be issued to the depository
banks for payment of tne $50,000,000 in
volved until the Attorney General has
passed upon the validity of the Panama
Canal Company's title.
"No money will be paid over till we
are sure of a clear title," said he. "I
think we will be secure beyond all
doubt this time, although it may take a
little time to complete the formalities
and the papers in shape."
"YTill it be necessary for our Govern
ment to send a representative to
Paris?" was asked.
"It may be," Shaw answered. "The
call on the depository banks," he con
tinued, "will be made in time to have
the funds in hand a week or more be
fore the transfer has to be effected. If I
thought that we had to pay the money
over to Panama in ten days I would
send out the call by wire immediately.
The bankers are to-day fully prepared
for it and could finance the withdraw
als without difficulty."
BO FEARS XO OBSTACLES.
President of Canal Company Expects
Karly Transfer of Concession.
PARIS. Feb. 25. â Conversations which
have occurred between M. Bo, president
of the Panama Canal Company, and
Embassador Porter show that in the
opinion of the former no obstacle will
be placed by the company in the way
of the transfer of the concession to the
United States.
At the Colombian legation the hope
is expressed that the United States
will delay the purchase of the con
cession until the French courts pass
upon the two applications submitted
to them â first, an order prohibiting
the company from concluding the sale;
second, an order that the company
recognize the right of Colombia to her
share, which the company holds passed
with the sovereignty to Panama, The
courts fixed March 9 for the argu
ments.
It was admitted at the Colombian
legation that there is every likelihood
of the court's refusing to grant the
writ enjoining the company from sell
ing the concession, but every effort
will be made to retain the ownership
of the Colombian shares, in order that
Colombia may profit in the distribution
of the money paid for the concessions.
KUMLER TAKES EXCEPTION
TO REMARKS OF COXRAD
Counsel for Defense in Postal Trial
Claims the Government's Attorney
Casts Imputation on thc Jury.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25. â Special
Counsel Conrad for the Government
in the postal trial concluded his argu
ment for the prosecution to-day. He
dwelt at length upon the question of
what resembles a reasonable doubt
and instanced cases where a single
juror had hung a jury through a mis
conception of the meaning of a rea
sonable doubt. He was interrupted by
Attorney Kumler, who charged that
the statements were an imputation
upon the jury in this case. A sharp
colloquy between Conrad and Kumler
followed.
Conrad attacked the statements
made on the stand by Mr. Lawrence
regarding his first examination of the
Groff fastener in 1895 and said that
they were not borne out by the cir
cumstances surrounding it.
Justice Pritchard announced that he
would deliver his charge to the jury
to-morrow morning.

CANDIDATES'
FRIENDS ARE
INDUSTRIOUS
CONGRESSMAN DICK. MEN
TIONED FORCHAIRMANOF
REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE
Prominent Republicans
in Fight for Chair
manship.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.â Senator
Scott of West Virginia had a long con
ference with the President to-day, dis
cussing fully with him matters relating
to national politics. Several men have
been mentioned in connection with the
chairmanship of the Republican Na
tional Committee, but thus far the sub
ject has not proceeded beyond the
realm of suggestion.
Among the names of the men pro
posed for the chairmanship are for
mer Governor Crane of Massachusetts.
Postmaster General Henry C. Payne of
Wisconsin, now acting chairman of the
committee; Senator Penrose of Penn
sylvania, Senator Scott of West Vir
ginia and General Charles Dick of Ohio.
Crane is a personal friend of Pres
ident Roosevelt and one of his closest
political advisers. The President de
sires in the event of his nomination
for the Presidency that Crane should
be identified in an important capacity
with the conduct of the Presidential
campaign, but it is known that Crane
hesitates to undertake the responsibil
ity of directing the campaign as chair
man on account of his health.
Members of the National Committee
have suggested that Postmaster Gen
eral Payne be selected as national
chairman. The suggestion was cor
dially received by the President, as he
entertains the highest regard for
Payne's political sagacity and ability.
It is said, however, to be quite improb
able that Payne will resign the Post
master Generalship to undertake the
work of directing the national cam
paign, for the reason that his health
will not permit him to undertake safe
ly the arduous labors of national chair
man.
Friends of General Dick have advo
cated warmly the desirability of his
selection as national chairman. He was
in close official touch with the man
agement of the last two national cam
paigns and was one of the most trust
ed lieutenants of Senator Hanna. and
besides having a wide acquaintance
throughout the country is regarded as
a notable campaign organizer. It can
be said that no determination of the
Republican national chairmanship will
be reached, perhaps, for three months.
Suggestions are being considered, but
no decision, even of a tentative nature,
has been or will be made until the
near approach of the Chicago conven
tion.
Wlihdraws From Senatorial Race.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 25. â J. L. Cas
wel of West Virginia to-day issued a
statement withdrawing from the race
for United States Senator In that
State.
PHILIPPINE SHIPPING
BILLS DISCUSSED BY TAFT
Secretary Seems to Favor Combina
tion of Frye Measure and Scheme
of the Commission.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.â Secretary
Taft to-day gave a hearing at the War
Department to a number of persons
interested in pending legislation rel
ative to the limitation of Philippine
commerce to American bottoms. The
arguments touched every phase of the
situation, with which Secretary Taft
appeared to be- very familiar. The
only novel proposition to-day was one
that seemed to emanate from Secre
tary .Taft himself, looking to a com
bination of the pending Frye shipping
bill, excluding foreign bottoms from
the Philippine trade with the tariff
reductions scheme proposed by the
Philippine Commission.
DOLE REFUSES TO 3IAKE
PORTUGUESE CITIZENS
Twenty Foreigners Admit They Want
to Become Americans in Order
to Hold Positions.
HONOLULU, Feb. 19.â Judge Dole
has refused to naturalize about twenty
Portuguese that desired to become
American citizens. Most of them were
residents of twenty years' standing
and the immediate cause of their wish
to embrace the rights and privileges
accorded by the constitution of the
United States was a desire to retain
their jobs in the road department. â¢ A
ruling by the Attorney General com
pelled Road Supervisor Johnson to dis
charge all men who were not . Ameri
can citizens and give work to\ native
Hawaiians. When questioned by Judge
Dole the Portuguese frankly admitted
that they only wanted citizenship in
order to retain their positions, so the
Judge declined to accommodate them.

SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, Feb. 25.'â At

WHt AFFAIRS
UNDER DEBATE
Fight Over the Pending Ap
propriation Bill Still Oc
cupies Attention of House
BURTON MEETS DEFEAT
Amendment Offered by Him
to Strike Out OneBattleship
From Measure Is Lost
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.â The build
ing programme of the navy, as con
tained in the pending naval appropria
tion bill, occupied the attention of the
House throughout the day and the
fight is by no means over. The min
ority members of the Naval Affairs
Committee, who, under the leadership
of Meyer of Louisiana, first gave their
indorsement to the measure, are cam
paigning for a reduction in the number
of ships to be authorized. The amend
ment to strike out the one battleship
made yesterday by Burton of Ohio was
defeated.
The cruisers were then put to the
test, and enough friends for them were
found for their retention. Construc
tion of the shjps in Government yards
proved to be a' fruitful topic for discus
sion, and an amendment; by Bell of
California requiring one collier to be
built in a Government yard was
adopted.
Appropriation for a preferential of
four Der cent in favor of bids from the
Pacific Coast was defeated. -
McDermott of New Jersey enter
tained the House with a five-minute
speech, proposing that all the ships
provided for in the bill be built in the
State of New Jersey. New Jersey, he
said, was one of the original thirteen
States, and therefore more entitled to
consideration than California.
"There is another reason why these
ships should be built in New Jersey,"
he added. "It is a reason that appeals
to economy and perhaps to charity.
The receiver of the great shipbuilding
trust is now a resident of New Jersey
and its principal yard is there. ' What
are you going to do when you find prop
erty owned by men who thirteen
months ago were Tcnown as princes of
finance to-day lying prostrate: boya
jumping over the machinery; the wood
going to rot and the iron going to rust
in the great Nixon ship yards in New
Jersey. May I not, then, with a voice
more pregnant than that which, comes
from California, appeal to you all.
Democrats and Republicans, to come to
the rescue of that trust and have your
ships built there?"
Humphreys' amendment was defeat
edâ76 to 98.
An amendment was offered by Rob
erts of Massachusetts increasing the
number of torpedo-boats authorized
from two to five, but it was not acted
upon.
An amendment by Rixey of Virginia
limiting to a maximum price of 5398
a ton the amount to be paid for armor
plate and should armor not be obtain
able at this price/ that a Government
armor plate factory be erected was
ruled out of order.
AGRICULTURAL BILL PASSES.
Senate Adopts Amendments of Benefit
to the Pacific Coast.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.â The Senate
to-day passed the agricultural and the
legislative, executive and judicial ap
propriation bills. An amendment to the
agricultural bill suggested by Heyburn
of Idaho caused an animated discus
sion. It contemplated supervision of in
terstate commerce so as to prevent the
transfer of plants or seeds fraudulently
marked from one State to another. The
amendment started a debate on patriot
ism. It was ruled out on a point of or
der.
An amendment offered by Heyburn
authorizing the Secretary of Agricul
ture to prohibit interstate shipments of
misnamed and misrepresented fruil
trees provoked a long discussion. It
was supported by Heyburn and Clark of
Wyoming, and opposed by Tillman,
Lodge, Teller, Proctor and Bailey.
In the agricultural appropriation bill
passed by the .Senate two amendments
are approved having special reference
to the conduct of experiment stations.
The. bill as it came from the House con
tained the following language: "The
Secretary of Agriculture is hereby au
thorized and directed to co-ordinate the
work of the several stations and the
work of the stations with the Depart
ment of Agriculture, to the end of pre
venting unnecessary duplication of
work, of increasing the efficiency of the
stations and the Department of Agri
culture and to unify and systematize
agricultural investigations in the
United States."
Upon motion of Senator Bard this
language was stricken out. The objec
tion was that under it the Government
would exercise too great, control over
State stations.
Senator Perkins also amended the bill,
broadening its scope with regard to
fighting diseases of the vine. The ap
propriation was increased from $5000 to
$12,000 for this purpose. The language
of the bill was changed so as to read
that this money shall be used . toward
"determining the adaptability of vari
ous grape stocks to the different soil
and climate conditions of the Pacific
Coast and their resistance to disease."

Colonel John McClcUan Advises With
Governor Carter on Question of Ha

HONOLULU, Feb. 25. â Colonel John
McClellan, commander of the United
States military division of Honolulu
is discussing with Governor Carter the
advisability of placing a battery of
the largest guns on the Punchbowl
crater, close behind the city of Hono
lulu. It is reported that consideration
of this plan may be recommended, in
stead of the recent suggestions of the
army board for a general line of shore
fortifications, on account of the Punch
bowl forts being quicker of completion
and more effective than long-range de
fenses along the ocean.
There is a scarcity of Japanese rice
in Honolulu and the dealers will be
obliged to make importations from the
United States.
The price of saki, the popular Jap
anese drink, is rising on account of
scant supply. It is said that Califor
nia wine may be substituted for saki.

(CtaVfltefet, 1W1, by Jcseph H. Bowie*.)
Another form of awkwardness in
any boxers Is the inability to rush
ithout leaving face or body exposed.
Terry AlcUovern, when at his best.
was the ideal '"rusher" and perfected
\h* â¢â¢whirlwind" style of attack.
With one arm crookVd before him,
bo as to protect th*Â» head and to knock
.-lside body blows; with the other hand
hammering away like lightning, yet
ever ready to shift in such a way as
to guard while the first hand attacked;
with head down, jaw drawn in, abdo
men drawn back s-o as to render heart
and wind almost inaccessible; with
THE -WHIRLWIND" STYLE.
body crouched yet not enough to pre
vent perfect agility, he would bore
away at an opponent, enveloping him
in a veritable shower of blows, yet al
most never leaving himself open to
counter attack.
Quickness, incessant motion-, good
balance, accuracy, impetus and a brain
uneonfused are the chief requisites for
running. The man who rushes blind
ly, swinging his arms like flails, and
who thinks that is boxing, is sadly
mistaken and usually pays dearly for
'-he Llunder.
In rushing more than at any other
time a man needs all his coolness and
skill. For he is courting attack and
he cannot hope to be as thoroughly
protected as when he is on the defen
sive.
When a man rushes you keep cool;
guard, sidestep and when necessary
give ground. But always be on the
lookout for an opening; never let the
assailant "get you going" by rushing
you off your feet. Remember that
when he is attacking the advantage
rests with you as long as you can
spy out and take advantage of all
openings and as long as your footwork
is clever enough to keep you out of
harm's way.
Other things being: equal, the ad-
"SPARRING FOR WIND."
vantage In boxing usually rests . with
the heavier of the two contestants. He
can put greater weight into his blows,
his rushes carry heavier weight (and
thus more force), and when on the
defensive he can often stop a lighter
antagonist's rush. By a sort of com
pensation the lighter of two boxers is
nearly always the quicker and thus
the contest becomes one of weight vs.
speed. Such was the fight in which
Corbett conquered Sullivan. Such, on
the other hand, was the fight wherein
the heavier Jeffries defeated Corbett.
Often In a friendly bout a man will
tire, will receive a blow that temporar
ily weakens or wearies him, or will
get out of breath. The thing to do at
such a Juncture is to "spar for wind"â
in other words, to keep the other; man
off with as few motions as possible,
resting solely on the defensive eifcept
Tor such feints as may serve to avert
a rush or a dangerous lead. Take
things easily, resting as much as possi
ble, yet keeping your I oe sX * distance
until the desired strength or speed is
restored.
There are several ways in which this
may be accomplished. It is best, of
course, not to let your opponent see
that that you are in distress. Keep on
the defensive, give ground if he rushes,
try to hold him at long range. All the
time breathe slowly in steady, deep
respirations (through the nostrils, with
lips closed), and resting as much as
you can the tired muscles. â¢
If you are in good condition you will
quickly regain strength and breath
enough to enable you to finish the
round. Often both men will become
simultaneously fatigued and will by
tacit mutual consent spar for wind un
til they are once more in shape for
active work.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Boys often weary their arms unneces
sarily in boxing by keeping the fists
tightly clinched all the time. This puts a
constant and needless strain on the
fingers and forearm. There is no excusa
for this.
Keep the hands half-open, or only
lightly clinched, except when actually
leading. Then close the fist just before
the blow lands. In this way you add
a certain degree of force to your blow
and miss much fatigue incident on
muscles too long left tense.
When you are rushed and are forced
to give ground d6 not let your desire to
get out of reach render you careless of
balance. In retreat, as well as In at
tack, balance is the foromost requisite.
If you are not careful your balance will
depart, you will shuffle awkwardly on
feet that are too near together and you
will in this attitude lose all chanqe of
landing a powerful blow, such as might
stop your opponent's rush, for with the
feet together and the body bent back
ward there remains little force to go
into a lead. While you can still keep
your feet in correct position and retain
a balance that will let you counter
heavily should the opportunity- arise,
you are not in any great danger from
the rush of the strongest, heaviest an
tagonist. Once lose your poise and bal
ance, however, and a child can upset
you.
Do not through fear or strategy fall
into the frequent error of turning your
back on your opponent during his
rush. Do not turn your back, for that
matter, at any stage of the bout.
I have seen many a beginner turn
sideways or half way around and let
a blow fall on back or shoulders in
stead of troubling himself to guard it
with his arms. I have seen far more
so-called boxers who, hard pressed.
turned their backs on their opponents,
doubtless in the belief that the latter
would not strike them there.
Now, this is cowardice and meanness
combined. There is no law in the an
nals of boxing which prohibits a man
from striking his opponent on the back.
If your opponent turns his back on you
hit his back as hard as you choose to.
You are taking no unfair advantage
of him in doing this. It will also teach
him to face you in future.
While we are on the subject of faulty
form let me warn you against one of
the commonest and worst faults in box
ing, the fault known as "snapping
back." It has ruined the form of many
a man and is fatally easy to acquire.
"Snapping back" is merely an ex
aggeration of the maxim: "Lead and
then get back on guard." The ideal
boxer delivers his blow and then brings
his arm back to "guard" as rapidly as
possible. But before he draws back his
arm he makes sure that the. blow is
fully delivered; that all the force and
reach which were to go into it have
been used.
Sometimes a man, in his haste to re
turn to guard, leads and before the
blow has fairly landed whips back his
arm. The blow does not travel Its full
length. It gets none of the force from
body and shoulder. It is a poor, nerve
less imitation of a blow. While every
by^Jaw.of boxing demands that the arm
return as quickly as possible to first
position as soon as a blow is delivered,
every by-law also forbids "snapping
back."
Nervousness, awkwardness and (In
rare instances) cowardice are contrib
utory causes to this habit. It is to be
avoided, even at the cost of speed and
at the risk of a return blow.
His Maiden Effort.
All hands were making political
speeches in the House the other after
noon when a Representative, making
his maiden speech, shot off a few
rhetorical fireworks for Judge Parker
of New York.
"Parker, Parker," said the crushing
Grosvenor of Ohio, In a musing tone,
getting to his feet and stroking his
Santa Claus beard reflectively. "Seems
to me that I've heard that name be
fore somewhere. Do you mean Judge
Parker of Xew York?"
"That's whom I mean," promptly
replied the young: man making his
maiden speech.
"Um â exactly," said Grosvenor.
"By the way, what's Judge Parker's
first name?"
The new Representative flushed and
started to stammer some reply. An
old-timer In a scat some distance be
hind the new man made a funnel of
his hands and tried to whisper the
name "Alton" to the new man. but
Grosvenor of Ohio saw this move.
"Hey, no coaching or offside plays!"
he demanded. "Now," turning to the
new Representative again, "what'B
Judge Parker's first name, -hey? Seems
to me that It's reasonable to expect
you to know the name of the man
you're booming for President of the
United States, isn't It? .What his first
name, anyhow?"
The new Representative made some
floundering reply to the general ef
fect that Judge Parker's first name
didn't make any difference, etc., but
he failed to get a^ay with iL The
House roared and presently the new
Representative brought his talk to an
abrupt close and sat down, looking
flabbergasted. â Omaha Bee.

THE CANAL TREATY.
WHEN the Panama revolution occurred, and the
canal treaty followed. The Call predicted that
the treaty would be ratified, and would be sup
ported by Democrats in the Senate. From the begin
ning it was known that fifteen Senators of. that party
would support it. Yet Mr. Gorman, with his force di
vided in halves, sought to make a party question. of it, to
put the administration in what the politicians call "a
hole." Since then the republic of Panama has made a
constitution and elected a national government to admin
ister it, and now the treaty is ratified, fifteen Democrats
voting for it.
Thus, the second attempt during this Congress to
make an issue against Roosevelt has failed. The minor
ity in each case has furnished support to his plans and
policies which were attacked, and the expected issue has
goiic glimmering to the limbo of failures. What is the
logical conclusion from this situation? Can it be other
than that the President is really representative of the
hopes and aspirations of the American people? The
canal treaty was supported by a public sentiment so
overwhelming that the minority felt it and could not
stand up against it. Of course, wisdom would have
dictated agreement with that sentiment in the first place,
to the end that such a project as the canal might be be
gun and finished '{without a tinge of partisanship. But
the President has been sustained, and public sentiment
has been saluted by half of the Democratic Senators.
While Senator Gorman made a capital mistake, he is
not the object of amusement. The simian feature in 'the
whole affair is furnished by Mr. William Randolph
Hearst, who hastens to say in his newspapers that the
fifteen Senators, in supporting the . administration,
obeyed his instructions! Yet in his papers of the oth of
last November he said: "Would Theodore Roosevelt
have dared to act toward Great Britain as he has toward
Colombia? What excuse can be offered for this astound
ing crime? None that any honest man will accept. If
President Roosevelt shall be sustained in this Panama
crime by his party, then his party would sustain him in
any freebooting foray against the lands and sovereignty
of our weaker neighbors, that might be agreeable to the
wishes and interests of such other aggregations of
greedy speculators as we see collected in and around the
rotten and scandal-coated French Panama Company.
The honor of the United States has been dragged in the
mud of Panama."
Now the President is sustained by both parties, and
Mr. William Randolph Hearst rushes into the glare of
the footlights shouting: "I did it. The Democratic Sen
ators followed my plan and voted my sentiments!" It
is amusing and at the same time disgusting. None will
resent it more than the Democratic Senators who had
their way to doing right made harder by the unscrupu
lous falsehoods of the man who claims them as his pup
pets.
The unpartisan feeling of the President and his desire
to put ; the construction in first-class control, regardless
of party, have been shown by his selection of commis
sioners.
Mr. William Randolph Hearst is now exclaiming in
poster type. "Mr. Roosevelt, build that canal." There is
no doubt that he will. He has begun the great
work, and the people will see to it that it is left in his
hands far toward its conclusion. When it .is finished, the
people will read, perhaps, in some crippled weekly news
paper, a feeble shout from Mr. Hearst, "I did it,"- and
then the country will grin. 4
The ratification of the treaty is preliminary to the
country's ratification of President Roosevelt next No
vember. If the Southern people are wise they will make
this the occasion for differentiating their local from their
national politics, and will join in this ratification. The
canal has long been the dream of their section. It has a
vast and valuable relation to their future prosperity.
They have more interest in it than the rest of the coun
try, because their necessities are greater. It is a great
national work, that should mark the final disappearance
of all issues that have their radix in the Civil War. Why
embarrass it by making an attempt to change the ad
ministration, which will fail, any way?
It is felt that if the South voted as her interests dic
tate, as the prosperity of her people requires, and as the
needs of development of her resources demand, she
would add largely to the electoral vote of President
Roosevelt. The present Democracy having ceased to be
a proper instrument of the public will, why not end the
faction fights which distract it, by completely evaporat
ing it as a political force, in the expectation that it will
reprecipitate in a more useful form?
The Grand Jury has commenced an inquiry to deter
mine to what extent and by whom the Almshouse has
been cheated of supplies and provisions ordered for the
proper conduct of the institution by the city authorities.
It is better late than never/ perhaps, for our governing
commissions to discover that nobody is so poor that he
may not be robbed.
HOSPITAL CARS.
THE CALL has often suggested that means be
sought to isolate from other passengers con
sumptives who travel to seek relief by
change of climate. The enormous increase of this
disease in the East, following the annual win
ter epidemic of grip and pneumonia in that re
gion, has caused a corresponding increase in the num
ber, of victims who seek relief on the hot deserts of New
Mexico. Arizona and Southern California. As it seems
to be settled that the disease is spread by infection, the
dried sputum in Pullman cars presents a real danger that
makes travel in them unpleasant' to a great many
healthy people.
Human sympathy is never withheld from consump
tives, but this only adds to the tension and discomfort of
traveling in the same cars with them. To meet the
growing difficulty, the Santa Fe road is having con
structed proper and well equipped hospital cars, in which
consumptive travelers will enjoy all that is had in first
class Pullmans, and also find such- other facilities and
comforts as their condition requires. These cars will
run to such points in, New Mexico, Arizona and Southern
California as are the objective of these unfortunate trav
elers.
The statistics show that on the hot* and drjf deserts
consumption is greatly mitigated, and when the patient
has the resolution to adhere to a proper use of the desert
air and sunshine it is wholly cured. It is gratifying
that in our country there are these desert regions, other
wise not useful to man, in which this dreadful disease
may be cured. All over the East the faces of the victims
are turned to the desert, where lies their hope' of life.
But mingling with other, travelers in transit- is also be
coming a reason for the restraint of healthy tourist
travel to Pacific Coast points, which are now more
sought than the French and Italian Riviera for rest and
â¢recreation in a clement climate during the winter
months. As- those who come here in health to escape
the winter diseases of the East which lead to consump
tion in a manner insure themselves against an attack, it
is plain that California climate is useful in restricting
the disease. If, however, great risk of infection is in
curred en. route, this travel will not come.
There may be an- initial difficulty in restricting con
sumptive travel to the new cars. In this much assistance
can be given by the medical profession in the East.
Physicians will see the obvious advantage of such cars
for their patients who are seeking relief by change of
location. It- is probable that the Santa Fe and other
roads which adopt the system will find it advantageous
to supply a physician also to attend to patients en route,
and finally it will doubtless be found that the patients
themselves will prefer the isolation and advantages of
the new system.
California will give .the Santa Fe great credit for in
augurating this system, since we need the removal of
every possible impediment in the way of travel to our
State. A policy that serves suffering humanity, protects
the. healthy from infection and promotes our material
welfare by removing an objection to travel is most en
terprising and praiseworthy, and its success will : be
promoted by every encouragement our . people can
render. /
Through the establishment of a correspondence
school the University of California 'hopes to make out
of the good farmers of the State a corps of conscien
tious students. If the wise men of Berkeley can now
only see their way clear to work out the reverse proposi
tion and make a few farmers out of their many students
a very serious problem will have been solved for Cali
fornia.
THE SUNDAY CALL'S POLICY.
FOLLOWING its policy of giving its /eaders the
latest and best literature in the world, The Sunday
Call paid $iooo to secure the exclusive rights to
"To-morrow's Tangle" in the West. . It will be published
complete in five successive installments, beginning next
Sunday, February 28. This is really a remarkable offer,
for this book cannot be bought elsewhere, in any form,
for five times what it will cost in The Sunday
Call, which gives in addition to this exclusive novel
many other brilliant features besides.
In "To-morrow's Tangle" Geraldine Bonner, the clever
California author, has written a novel as strong, as tense,
as thrillingly dramatic and as thoroughly Californian as
"The Octopus," with which Frank Norris amazed the
world a few years ago. Indeed, "To-morrow's Tangle,"
which is a brand new book just off the presses, bids fair
to become vastly more popular, because not only all the
people in this almost historical drama but all the places
wherein'they love and hate and' fight their public and
private battles are known. .. - j t
It is a story of the early pioneers and their children,
brought right down" to date, but so entirely different are
the scenes and incidents from anything ever written be
fore, with the history and development of California as a
background, that this story ranks at once as a unique
and distinct creation.
The prologue, with its death and birth on the scorch
ing desert â its outrageous trade in wives and horses by
the Mormon, who afterward becomes a "bonanza king,"
and the primitive marriage in a blizzard, will grip the
heart through every word.
Indeed it is an intimate knowledge of the characters
and the circumstances of their lives that enhances an ap
preciation of the intensely dramatic and delightfully
human qualities of this book. Mariposa's rehearsal at
the Grand Opera-house and her bitter love scenes in
Golden Gate Park, the stirring tragedy in the million
aire's home in Menlo Park, the meeting between Mari
posa and the Mormon's second wife in the mansion on
Nob Hill, the strange discovery of the millionaire's son
in the photograph gallery on Post street, Mariposa's
fight with Essex in the rain on Sutter street, and her
thrillingly pathetic plight in the old garden on Russian
Hill are vivid â almost too realistically vivid. And yet
they are only incidents in a wonderfully well rounded
volume.
Among other brilliant, features, for instance, there is
"The Human Halra7' written by the Queen of Roumania,
an article that is as beautiful as it is strange in concep
tion.
Then there is an article that shows the. incredible de
velopment of Japan since her wonderful awakening in
186S from the despotic rule of the Shogun, the military
usurper, whd kept the Mikado practically a prisoner
through the force of arms, and who made a treaty with
Commodore Perry in his own name instead of the Em
peror's, which endured for fourteen years without Amer
ica or any of the allied nations becoming the wiser.
Add to this the "Brownie and the Bolo,'*"vrhich is one

A local physician, testifying in a murder case the
other day, declared that he knew of a doctor who while
insane for a year practiced his profession with customary
success. v This startling announcement- of the man of
pills and pellets is to be applauded for its frankness.
Most of us knew that something was wrong somewhere,
but now we have a flooding light of revelation. The
medico of whom the witness spoke is probably not
unique.;
. In the general unrest that is sweeping throughout Eu
rope because of the .war in the Far East there are signs
that- the Finns may rise against their Russian oppressors
and strike a blow for. freedom. Perhaps of all the mod
ern races of the world that have felt the heel of tyranny
the Finns deserve moÂ§t the sympathy, of free people.
Progressive, loyal, peaceable, they have been creatures
of monstrous governmental malice.
France has decided for herself the very impor
tant question whether or not Japan gave violence to the
laws of nations by the attack upon the Russian boats at
Chemulpo. Meanwhile the rest of us^are trying to* de
termine whether/our congratulation shall be extended
to. the Japanese, for the thoroughness of their victory or
to th"e Russians for their splendid example of ! patriot
ism and heroism .
TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
"It would not surprise me in the
least," said a prominent lawyer toe
other day to a number of attorneys
with whom he was enjoying lunch, "to
see the Japs whip the Russians. I, or
rather my wife, had an experience the
other day wjth one of the little brown
men that caused me to think that they
are a great people.
"It was last Saturday, I think, that
my wife sent o*ut to a Jap hou3e clean
ing establishment for a man to do
some window washing and other little
things about the house. A neat and
natty little chap came over. It was
Just at 2 o'clock when he started in
and by 4 he had the work finished. My
wife paid him the half dollar he de
manded, and was so pleased at the way
he worked that she told him to sit
down and take a little lunch of pre
serves and cakes. He accepted the in
vitation with a smile and a 'thank you,'
and for fifteen minutes was busy with
the edibles. When he got through my
wife showed him to the door. She was
greatly surprised when he seemed re
luctant to leave and almost fainted
when he demanded 10 cents.
"'What for?' she said. 'I paid you
50 cents for two hours' work. You
c-nly charge 25 cents an hour."
."'Yes,' said the Jap; 'him all right:
but I stay fifteen minutes kitchen. Boss
no pay me to eat.* "
Grateful Recognition.
It is an old saying among raift-oad
men that they know when everything
is going along all right from the mere
fact that no complaints are received.
They do not expect and rarely receive
praise from the public they serve, but
they are pretty certain to hear of it
when things so wrong. It must there
fore have been very gratifying to our
Southern Pacific friends when the pas
senger department in this city received
the following resolution, dated Sacra
mento, February 18, voted for and
signed by every passenger on the train
that had been detained by the washouts
south of Ashland:
"Be it resolved by the passengers on
the extra late No. 15 train from Ash
land to San Francisco, that it is the
unanimous opinion of all passengers
that they have been treated with ex
ceeding good courtesy and the best pos
sible service by all officials, conductors
and trainmen, and we especially thank
Pullman Conductor L. P. Bradley for
his kind and efficient care and atten
tion during the entire trip, and espe
cially on account of the consideration
of the company to the traveling public
during the delay caused by landslides,
washouts, etc., of this special trip."
Modern Life Savers.
They were evidently from up in the
valley â that, old man" with the long
linen- duster and the bright-eyed lit
tle chap who sat by his side upon the
deck of the ferrv-boat. This was ob
viously the first trip to the city which
either of the twain had ever enjoyed,
though the old gentleman tried to look
unconcerned.
As the boat slipped swiftly past
Goat Island the sharp eyes of the
youngster spied the big red buoys
which were scattered about the dock
near the lighthouse.
"Oh, pa, see them punkins! They
don't raise them so big as that back
in Capay."
"No, m'son, them ain't punkins."
The old man put on a wise look while
he stroked his gray whiskers reflect
ively. "Y'see, them Is the life-savin"
contraptions which they carries on the
decks of steamboats. If the boat gets
wrecked out in the ocean the passen
gers throw them over into the sea and
clings to them until they is picked up.
"But I du say," mused the gentle
man from Capay, "that I shouldn't
think them would be the most corn
fable things in the world to sit on
durin' a ragin' storm with the waves
swashin' some."
In Winter.
In winter, when the nights are long,
I sit and dream before the fire;
My heart Is light, my love is strong
For books, near friends that never tire,
In winter, when the nights are long.
I read from eve till midnight comes;
I stir my soul with history;
My spirit tnen with heroes roams;
I quaff of poets' mystery
From out the worn beloved tomes.
In winter, when the nights are long,
When lamp burns bright, and firÂ«
burns low,
I hear again full many a song.
And voices out of the long ago.
In winter, when the nights are long.
Loved poems! Ah! how sweet you seem
Ballade, rondeau arjd villanelle;
Before the glow I sit and dream.
Your music casts o'er me its spell.
As shadows dance and embers gleam.
In winter, when the nights are long,
I revel. Some the summer praise.
It* gentle brerze. its sunlight strong;
But let mo dedicate my lays
To Winter, when the nights are long.

'A Novel Pozver Scheme.
It is believed that berore very long
the famous Dead Sjea will ba exploited
for industrial purposes. French, engi
neers arÂ« at work on three different
projects with this purpose in view. Ac
cording to the Boston Transcript, the
level of the Dead Sea being more than
1300 below that of the Mediterranean
and Red seas, It is thought by con
necting either of these two seas by
means of a canal with the Red Sea a
stream of water would flow with a
velocity, calculated to produce some
25,000 horsepower. There is no danger,
it is asserted, of an overflowing of the
Dead Sea, for the waterfe there evap
orate at so grsat a rate (6,000.000 tons
a day) that the Incoming waters would
make no appreciable difference in the
level. One project is to start the canal
from the Bay. of Acre, read It south
ward past Mount Tabor, and let it Join,
at ; Eaisan. the waters of the Jordan.
Another plan is to build the canal along
the railway line from Jaffa to Jerusa
lem. But this would mean blasting a
tunnel of some thirty-seven miles
through the mountains of Old Judea.
The third project, the cheapest, pro
poses to start -at Akaba. in the Red
Sea,\and pass through the desert of
Wady-el-Jebek Having obtained pow-
er in this manner, it is thought many
Industrial works would bs carried on.
The Prize Burglar.
A Paris paper takes note of a reÂ»
markable type of criminal ir> the fol
lowing article:
"Laurent Delarue, a criminal, who
robbed on so large a scale and with
such method and resources as to win
for himself the title of 'King of the
Burglars*,' was brought up for trial
to-day before the Seine-et-Olse Court,
charged with a large number of
thefts in various parts of the coun
try. *
"Delarue graduated in his profes
sion by a systematic course of educa
tion, working for some years an a safe
maker and afterward as a locksmith.
Having thus acquired much valuable
technical knowledge, he took up hla
quarters at Sartrouville, a village ten
miles from Paris, and raided houses
in every direction. Pome 500 or S00
robberies are put down to him and
over 1500 witnesses can be called if
necessary.
"One night he broke into a small
railway station near Dieppe, wrenched
away the little safe from its fastenings,
and. hoisting it on his shoulders, pro
ceeded to a neighboring field to break
open and ransack it at his leisure.
"A villager who caught sight of him
from his window called upon him. to
stop, but Delarue paid no heed to him.
Thereupon the peasant fetched his gun
and fired both barrels at the robber.
The bullets, however, flattened them
selves against the safe, and Dolarue.
dropping his burden, made for the
railway station at Auppray, which ha
pillaged thoroughly."
Coal for Luck.
Recently a burglar in an English Po
lice Court was found to carry a piece
of cc-al in his pocket "for luck." Many
English criminals think coal carried
about with them gives good fortune.
A belief in coal as a talisman is said
to have been held by the early Britona,
and it is frequently found in their bu
rial places converted into personal or
naments, such as beads. Believers in
dreams maintain that to dream of coal
is a certain sign of coming riches.
Then, too, there was a famous specu
lum, or mirror of divination â that
caused a great sensation in the six
teenth century â of Dr. Dee, which was
formed of cannel coal, though the doc
tor pretended to have received it from
the angels.

Closure of cloture is a method for clos

that of the previous question in Amer

French Chamber of Deputies the
president is to take the sense of the
chamber before pronouncing the clos
ing of debate. If the cloture is op
posed only a single speech against it
is allowed. The cloture being once
pronounced no further debate la al
lowed. In the English Parliament the
previous Question does not have, as
in the United States, the effect of sup
pressing all further debate on the

LAWLESS TELLS
OF COST OF GAS
.
Manager of the Local Corpo
ral ion Claims Product Has
Keen Disposed Of at a Loss
The Supervisors, sitting: as a com
mittee of the whole, resumed the in
quiry regarding the cost of producing
and distributing; gu.s in this city yes
terday with a view of fixing a rate for
the coming year. Supcr%isor Sander
eon presided, and J. F. Lawless, man
ager of the San F'rancisco Gas and
Klectric Company, was interrogated by
Supervisors d'Ancona, Brandenstein
and Braunhart.
Manager Lawless testified that the
company has manufactured very little
coal gas during the last two years, as
it is too expensive. A careful estimate
mado in 18S2 showed that it cost 65.21
'.ents a hundred to produce coal gas
Â»s agair^t 34 27 cents for water gas.
This estimate included the purchase of
coal, coke and other supplies and wages
of the men ai the works, but did not
include the salaries cf men employed
at the main office. The expenses of
1-roducingr r.if were summarized as fo!-

Manager Lawless stated that during:
li'CZ gas had been said in many in
stances below the cost of production
owing to the close competition. Be
cauF? of this also many repairs which
should have been made were neglected.
Ther* is a floating indebtedness of
$1,000,000 c-n the concern which was

VICTORY WON
OVER A TRUST
United States Circuit Court
Decides Suit in Favor of
Lowry & Daly, Tile Dealers
For the third time in the last six
years the firm of Lowry & Daly, tile,
mantel and grate dealers in this city,
has been awarded a decision over the
firm of W. W. Montague and others.
The last decision was given Wednes
day at Washington, D. C, in the Cir
cuit Court of Appeals.
In 1897 Lowry '& Daly brought
suit against Montague and the Tile,
Mantel and Grate Association on the
ground that it was nothing more or
less than a trust. They further stated
that the association had injured their
trade to a great extent and that ac
cording to what is known as the
"Sherman act" the association was un
lawful.
The Sherman act, which was passed
in IS 90, provides that associations of
the kind are unlawful and that any
person bringing suit against such an
association and proving his case De
given three times the amount shown
to hava been lost, also the expenses
of the suit and lawyers' fees.
, Lowry & Daly were awarded $3000
damages and $750 to cover lawyers'
foos. The defendants claimed that
$7 50 was out of reason and the case
wj)s carried to the Circuit Court of Ap
peals at Washington.
Daly (stated yesterday afternoon that
th^ amount his firm will be given will
approximate 53000, while the expenses
of the suit will be about $10,000.
he knew of a code provision requiring
all tfebts of a corporation to be paid
before a dividend could be declared, he
stated that he had never heard of such
a lav/.
When interrogated regarding the
streets where double mains are in use,
Manager Lawless said that these are
abgc-liitely necessary, as a single main
could 'not carry the gas required. When
the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Cornptiny absorbed the other corpora
tions It simply connected the pipe lines
instead of taking up both and laying
one Ia<Tge new main.
. At present the company Is distrib
uting /one-fortieth of its output at 50
cents (a tht usand, cne-twenty-sixth at
75 cents and the balance at a dollar.
The variation in prices is explained by
the fak:t that it is filling contracts made
by th* Independent Company.
According to Mr. Lawless, the re
turns i for the year were but $374,000,
while 'to make a fair profit on the In
vestment they should be at least $1,300,
000. Hd? further stated that while there
was a \seeming profit during, the last
year there was an actual deficit of
$226,000. 1 The company hopes to make
this' up during the coming, year by an
fncreaeeql output at a fair rate. The
investigation will be resumed this
morning. \

RAILROAD MAN IS MULCTED
OF HIS HARD-EARNED COIN
Two Robbers Are Held for Trial Before Superior Courv
for Holding Up a Passer-Byâ "Open Door" Men receive
Clemency â Burglar With a Bad Name Must Answer
Joseph Joyce makes a living by
screwing up brakes with a baseball
bat on the Southern Pacific freight
trains. When he recreates he walks.
During one of hi3 recreation periods
he^took a passear up Fourth street in
the directiQn of Market. From Town
send-street depot to Market street lie
many joints where steam, beer is
vended.
Joyce fell to them, severally and col
lectively. By the tirne he reached
Mission street he was in an adipose
condition. Two men saw him and
he looked good to them. They took
hold .of him by the two wings and
delved deeply into his ciothes. Alto
gether Joyce lost 520 90. When he
discovered that he was robbed he
made an outcry and Policeman Culli
nane arrested George Garam and
Frank Carroll.
Both defendants were before Judge
Cabaniss yesterday and were arraign
ed and instructed. When they were
searched at the City Prison Wednes
day night Garam had a $20 gold piece
deftly hidden in his underclothes and
Carroll held in his vest pocket thv;
missing 90 cents that Joyce alleges
was his property."
Hugh McCaffery is an apostle of
the 'open door" policy. When he
found the room of E. P. Woods with
a swinging portal unbarred by a latch
he entered. The room was at 716%
Folsom street and the sleeper awoke.
McCaffery was willing to plead to
most any old charge when he appear
ed before Judge Conlan yesterday. He
eaid he was drunk when he opened the
door of Woods' room and all 'he want
ed was to lie down and go to the big
rest. All larcenous Intentions were
foreign to his mind.
When he appeared In court yester
day he told such a straight story that
he was dismissed. Woods, who sum
moned a policeman during the inva
sion by McCaffery, was unwilling .to
testify to the burglary charge which
he first preferred.
Vincenso Gionannlni used his name
to break Into the grocery of Matteuci
& Vannuccl at 124 Pacific street. It
was steel cut steel as far as names are
concerned, but Gionannini beat the
firm to the cash register. In the
morn they found silver missing and at
night they lay for the thief. When
Gionannini waded through the black
ness on his last foray one of the part
ners popped up from behind the coun
ter and got a strangle* hold on .the
thief. i\ >
Gionannini was before Judge Fritz
yesterday for his crime and was held
to answer before, the Superor Court
in J3000 ball.
Lena Fargo is a thin little 7 woman
with bad eyes. She was convicted yes
terday in Judge Fritz's court of petty
larceny. In a trusting moment MrÂ». s
May McMillan turned ' over ~ to : her. a
flat on Market street while she - made
a Journey to the Cast. On her * return
she. missed several valuables and
among them was a bunch of velvet,
purchased at large cost from a prom
inent dry goods house. Only four yards
had been taken* from the piece of cloth
and the crime was petty larceny. If
she had taken the full /bolt it would
have been ] grand larceny in the most
formidable style. :
Miss .Fargo was fined $20 for her
peculation and given the alternative of
spending twenty days in the County
Jail. A spruce mug" stepped forwaid
and laid a shining double eagle on the
clerk's desk, so the woman went free.
John Dowd has a habit of beating
his wife every time he loads up on suds.
Before Judge Conlan yesterday h*
pleaded as an excuse that he was car
rying a Brannigxin and in sober mo
ments he would never lay a thumb on
"the ould woman." Dowd looked bad
to the Judge and he was sent to ths

PRESIDENT DIAZ
FORCES A TRUCE
Mexico s Executive Compels
Warring; Stevedores to
Load : Acapulco's Freight
The steamship Acapulco, which ar
rived yesterday from Panama and way
ports, had a lively at Aca
pulco on her way up the coast. When
she reached the Mexican port a bitter
war was being waged between two
rival shipping companies on the water
front and the handling of all outward
bound freight had been stopped.
Awaiting shipment on the Acapulco
was a large quantity of freight, includ
ing 30,000 bags of coffee. While one of
the launch companies was preparing to
transfer the coltee, the other, which
owns, the wharf,- refused to permit its
rival to use the structure and take the
freight to the vessel.
Captain Russell, after waiting sev
eral hours for an adjustment of the ex
isting difficulties and making futile ef
forts to have hia freight excluded from
the ban placed on all freight on the
wharves, went ashore and telegraphed
to President Diaz a statement of the
condition of affairs at that port and
politely requested the Government to
devise some means for facilitating the
transfer of the freight. An hour later
a dispatch came back that Captain
Russell need not worry further; that
the President was preparing to take
necessary steps to shorten'the delay of
the Acapulco. Hardly had this mes
sage reached Captain Russell before he
was visited by a representative of the
Government, who stated that he was,
authorized to assist the captain In
every possible way, and assured him
that President Diaz had already com
municated to the warring companies
instructions to immediately remove the
Acapultfo's freight from the wharf to
the vessel under penalty of being. Im
prisoned and forfeiting their conces
sions in the, harbor.
There was some show 'of defiance to
the President's message at first, but
when several Government officials ap
peared on the scene and gave' out the
information that Diaz had wired them
to call on the military if it was found
necessary to promptly execute hi3
commands, the rival shipping forces
quickly turned their attention to the
Acapulco's freight and hurriedly trans
ferred it \ to", the vessel, which finaily
proceeded on her northern voyage after
half a day's delay.
-Just before the, Acapulco sailed Pres
ident Diaz sent word to Captain Rus
sell that he deeply regretted the dis
courtesy shown him in a Mexican port, i
buLassured the commander of the Aca
pulco that the incident would i not be
repeated, and that intno circumstance
would the Government permit any in
terruption to' the commercial relations
between that country and the United
States.
When the Acapulco left Panama all
was quiet and the United States fleet
was busily .engaged in the bay of
Chame at target practice. The work of
the gunners was remarkably good, and
particularly those iOf the New York,
which was reported to; have made a
great record at the targets. .

Cattle Shippers Meet With
JJaiiroad Men dud Discuss
Methods of Transportation
CHICAGO, Feb. 25.â An important
meeting was held' here to-day between
a committee representing the National
Livestock Association and the freight
traffic managers of railway line* cen
tering in Chicago. The members of
the livestock association have been for
some time opposed to the application
of the tonnage system in the method
of transporting livestock, the opposition
being made on the ground that the
system reduced the running time of
trains and thereby caused heavy
shrinkage In the weight and value of
animals. The livestock association
also asked that the return pass privi
lege be restored to bona fide shiDDers
and that there be a readjustment of
freight rates.
The meeting was exceedingly har
monious. During the discussion the
traffic managers conceded that the live
stock service during the past year had
not been satisfactory, and that repre
sentations made by the stockmen would
be immediately taken up. with assur
ance that there would speedily be a
satisfactory adjustment. All transpor
tation . lines running* south and west
were represented.
The livestock committee consisted of

IN THE RING
Opening Sight of Olympic

31ABTIN BESTSEEYNOIiDS
Latter Imitates His Oppo
nent's Style and Puzzles
Him During First Bound
The Olympic Athletic Club gymna
sium was thronged with members last
night at the opening of the club's three
day boxing tournament. Seldom has
it been the good fortune of the mem
iÂ»crs to witness such exciting sport as
was presented by the boxers who took
j>art in the fifteen bouts which were
decided. A feature of the tournament
was the number of promising young
lioxers who appeared, some for the
lirst time. Among' these were Jack
.Lenahan; George Finnegan, the ban
lam champion; Willie Dwyer. Al Ridge
and Robert Lundie.
The first night of a big tournament
if? not expected to provide sensational
t-{>ort, as it is then the poorer boxers
are being weeded out. Last nleht
proved an exception, as the draw for
partners resulted in a number of
<-venly contested bouts. There were
Â« nough knockouts to please the most
inveterate followers of the ring. Ref
eree Eddie Graney also stopped some
<<f the bouts when he thought men were
l>*-ing punished unnecessarily.
There was no delay between bouts.
<>ne pair of boxers usually entering the
ring before the previous pair had time
to pull off their gloves. The best bouts
of the evening were those in which
Willie Dwyer beat Richard Murray and
Paul Martin beat Al Reynolds. < .
FIGHTING IS FAST.
Dwyer and Murray went three des
perate rounds, both standing bravely
to their guns and plugging throughout.
Dwyer was the cleverer hitter and
Jlnally -won by a shade.
AJ Reynolds imitated Paul Martin's
peculiar crouch and for a time they
hopped about like a pair of game cocks.
Martin did r.ot know wliat tactics to
pursue in the first round, especially
Â«fter he was knocked down with a
s^harp left to the Jaw. He did better ia
Jhe second round, knocking Reynolds
down several times until Referee
tlraney stopped proceedings.
Dave Campbell, a bantam weight,
outpointed James Lundberj?. Neither
of them showed any class. Campbell
had the longer reach and played for
his opponent's face continually.
Eddie Smith outgamed John Ward
and won cleverly on points.
Jack Lenahan and Charles Hamilton,
two spidery youths in the bantam class,
pave a clever exhibition. Lenahan won
all the way, proving a clever boxer and
â  hard hitter for one of his ounces.
Billy Brannan furnished the comedy
element of the evening. He was drawn
asainst the champion bantamweight,
O. W. Finnepan. Brannan, who is
short and chunky, presented so quaint
*>.n appearance that the spectators
howled. He lasted just twenty seconds
after the bell sounded.
DKISCOLL WINS IIAXDILV.
Barney Driscoll had William Johnson
buffaloed after making: a few passes
and won handily.
John Murray took one in the stomach
from Al. Rid^e in the second round and
went to the mat. Ridge, who has a
style like ihat of Kid McCoy, showed a
wicked left and a good right and is a
boxer of great promise.
William Merritt and Ed Carroll
â wrestled and tapped for three uninter
esting rounds. The Judges gave it to
Carroll.
Harry Tcnny went at Fred Hutchin
sr>n in workmanlike manner and
knocked him down after a few feints.
He knocked him down apain and Ref
eree Graney stopped it.
Frank Edwards and Richard Gordon
put up so poor an exhibition that the
referee stopped it and declared it no
contest, to the great satisfaction of the
FP*"-tatorfi.
Thomas Tij?he closed his eyes each
time Champion Joe Carroll feinted at
him. The end came in the second
round aft<?r Carroll worked his shift
on Tighe twice.
W. J. Leonard stopped Emil Barbee
in one round. He knocked bim down
repeate,dly. and Referee Graney stop
ped proceedings.
Robert Lundie wore Jack Hughes
down with stiff lefts to the body and
won handily in throe rounds.
ARTHUR KNOCKED OUT.
Frank Flores knocked out Henry Ar
thur In the first round. The w'inner
surprised the spectators, who did not
think much of his chances. He proved
a terrific hitter, and the man with the
aureola haÂ«r never had a chance.
Robert Cairns stopped James Brad
ley in the first round of their bout,
after a fierce sJuggJng match.
The Pacific Athletic Association stop
ped the use of professional second* so
Jam Berger went behind many of 'the
Olympic Club men instead of De Witt
Van Court, who has acted in the past.
The tournament goes on to-night.

'I am always ready to fight when

There is no chance of the intended

THE MIST SCORES WINNING BRACKETS
FIRST TIME OUT WITH THE SILK UP
Travers Is First
Astride Three
Winners.
About the only performance worthy
of especial â¢ mention at Oakland track
yesterday was the well chiseled turn
of speed shown by The Mist in the
maiden two-year-old event a three and
a half furlongs. The fllly is a full
sister to The Fog:, once raced aroung
these diggings by the departed Willie
Sink, now in France, and until yes
terday's race a novitiate at the* game
of racing. ,She was known to be fast,
but this. <Jfd not prevent her price from
soaring upward until 4 and 5 to 1 was
"obtainable. The regulars and the dele
gation from Pike County, Missouri,
contented themselves with seizing all
the 8 to 5 in sight about Bob Ragon.
Bullman was to pilot the latter, and
that made it all the stranger, for John
is recognized as a virtuoso when it
comes io guiding youngsters. When
Jake Holtman released the barrier it
certainly looked gloomy for The Mist,
for Jack Martin was pinched by two
other starters for a second and could
not let the filly down. Finally. Jack
dropped in on the rail, and The Mist
passed one after another, winning clev
erly from Edgecliff and Saccharate in
:44. Bob liagon quit badly the last
eighth. The winner is a slashing look
ing daughter of Magnet and will take
some beating from now on. She is
owned by W. H. Hammond and trained
by D. Cameron.
It was to be expected there would be
some surprises, as the track was very
muddy, still there were no startling
ones. Handpress and Isabellita were
the only winning choices, but none of
the other horses earning brackets es
caped the sharpshooters.
The eleven starters in the opening
sprint were as devoid of class as a
clam is of feathers, hence it was a
very open betting affair. Dusty Miller
at first enjoyed the call, receding later
in the betting and running unplaced.
The winner turned up in The Hawaiian,
a 10 to 1 shot played down to 8. Trav
el's saved a world of ground on the
stretch turn with the outsider, and in
a driving finish led Bell on Chaple past
the judges' stand a neck. Red Bird quit
and finished third, after cutting out the
early pace.
Another odds and ends assortment
started in the mile selling affair, with
Isabelllita ruling an even money choice.
Travers succeeded in dropping the
mare in first, but it was a very lucky
win. Elmer L., under moderate hand
ling, closed very strong, only losing the
decision by a nose. The latter was
10. to 1 and old Searcher at the same
odds ran third.
Bullman, in place of Jack Martin,
worked a remarkable change in Hip
ponax. The last timeHipponax started
was in the very questionable looking
seven-furlong run won by Whiskers,
on which occasion he was never a con
tender. In the six and a half furlong
selling number yesterday Bullman
sailed out in front with the Lane entry
and he won all the way. Holbrook
rode a ridiculously weak race on the
6 to 5 favorite Mocorito, losing â¢ the
place to Fair Lady Anna by more than
a length. With a competent rider up,
the first choice could have won.
Only Johnny Daly's clever handling
of Handpress won the fifth race for
Billy Magrane's little Hanover hors?.
Handpress was deprived of a purse the
day previous through ill racing luck
and closed a 2 to 1 favorite. Daly out
broke his field at the start and hustling
the first choice all the way he stalled
off the late challenge of Buxton astride
Galanthus, getting the verdict by a
neck. Had the last named horse not
been compelled to travel the overland
route he would have been returned the
winner. Travers finished a good third
with Harbor.
With such rapidity had the track
dried that the last event over a mile,
at one time considered a good thing for
Diderot, was now conceded to Axmin
ster. Buxton had the mount on Billy
Randall's horse, which was sent to the
post an 8 to 5 favorite. At the first
turn Buxton managed to get involved
in a bumping match, which materially
lessened his chances. Travers rode a
splendid "race on Diderot, moving along
from third position at the right time
and in a mild drive disposed of the
tardy arriving Axminster by more than
a length. Flaneur, after making the
pace for seven-eighths of the route, lost
the place by a nose. I Know fell In
for strong support, but cut no figure in
the running.
Dr. Rowell's apprentice, Travers, is
apparently destined to fill the vacancy
left void by the departure of Hilde
brand. Travers was first past the wire
yesterday on The Hawaiian, Isabellita
and Diderot, and in no instance was it
a case of cakewalk. <
Hipponax was boosted $200 over his
entered selling price by Harry Robin
son. No change of ownership.

UNDER ARREST
Henry Blume, Ex-Convict.
Finds Himself Again Be
hind Bars in City Prison
An ex-convict who is nearing the age
of threescore and ten was arrested
yesterday morning on Larkin street by
Policeman Wolters of the identification
bureau and booked at the City Prison
on charges of obtaining goods by false
pretenses and defrauding an innkeeper.
The prisoner gave the name of Henry
Blume, but he has also been known as
H. Blaune, Henry Brown, H. Bracker
and H. Beck.
Blume on February 22. called at the;
office of the Imperial Glove Company,
1236 Mission street, and represented that
he was a merchant in Sonora, Calave
ras County. He ordered $300 worth of
gloves and took twelve dozen, the re
mainder to be sent to the ferry ad
dressed to Blume. He gave the com
pany a check on a bank in Sonora, but
R. Griswaid, one of the partners,'
learned that no one of the name of H.
Beck, which Blume had given, had an
account at the bank, and the parcel
was not forwarded. While Blume and
Griswaid were walking downtown after
the order was booked they met Mayor
Schmltz, and Blume warmly shook the
Mayor's hand. ";:'â¢',.
Blume sold the twelve dozen gloVes to
A. Sommer, a second-hand dealer at 503
Pacific street for $12, and had arranged
with Sommer for the disposal of the
balance of the $300 worth. Blume had
been living at the Windsor Hotel under
the name of Henry Brown, a retired
merchant, and took his departure leav
ing an unpaid bill for board and lodg
ing of $56. M'-<
Blume on July 13, 1893, was sentenced
to serve three years in San Quentin for
obtaining money by false pretenses in

TOURS EUROPE
FOR THE FAIR
Lieut. Garden, Sent After
Machinery Exhibits for Ex
position, Lecturing: Here
Lieutenant Godfrey Lynet Carden of
the United States revenue cutter ser
vice, who is at present assigned to
duty in the machinery department of
the St. Louis exposition, is at the Pal
ace Hotel. The officer only recently
returned from an extended trip through
Europe in the interest of the exposi
tion. He was assigned by the Wash
ington authorities to the Pan-Ameri
can Exposition as superintendent of
the munitions of the War Department,
and having made a success of his work
there his services were asked for by
the management of the fair at St.
Louis. During his recent travels
abroad Lieutenant Carden visited all
the important machinery manufactur
ing centers, including the big gun
plants, and has since made several in
teresting reports of 'his observations to
the St. Louis Commission and written
a number of technical articles for the
scientific papers of this country. It
was these reports and contributions to
the papers that prompted the St. Louis
Exposition Commission to start him out
on a? lecturing tour, which has already
included addresses at many of the lead
ing colleges and other institutions of
learning in the East and Middle West
and will include many more before his
trip has ended. His itinerary in this
city includes two lectures, both at the
Young Men's Christian Association's
'Hall. The first was delivered lasi even-^
ing and the second will be delivered
to-night. ; Next Week he will speak at
Stanford, and then proceed eastward
to keep engagements at other colleges.
All of Lieutenant Carden's lectures are
illustrated with photographs which he
took while visiting the various big
manufacturing ' concerns of Europe,
among them the Krupp Gun Works of
Germany, arid he dwells' mainly' on the
comparative magnitude of the estab
lishments of the " different European
countries, their methods of manufac
turing great machines and the condi
tions that exist there in the way of
making those r.*anufacturers strong
competitors commercially and in
science and progress to this
country. Discussing his observa
tions yesterday afternoon, Lieu
tenant Carden said that while the
United States was keeping apace, if
not in advance of the rest of the world
in the matter, of mechanical construc
tion,, It had yet neglected to pursue the
economical methods practiced In Eu
rope. With its great facilities for man
ufacturing and its technical knowledge!
this country, âº he declared, i3 proceed
ing in Its art of mechanical construc
tion in a wasteful manner, and he cited
many. kinds. of machinery in which his
claims were fully, justified, among them
the modern , locomotive and the j furnace
blast, with their enormous : percentage
BASEBALL MEN
IN A QUANDARY
Morley f s Sudden Eesignation
Comes as a Big Surprise to
"Fans" and Magnates Alike
NO ACTION IS TAKEN
If Southern Manager Decides
to Stand Pat, His Successor
Will Shortly Be Named
The abrupt resignation of Manager
James F. Morley as head of the Los
Angeles baseball team has caused no
end of talk and comment among the
followers of the game in this city, and
fans and magnates are In a quandary.
Ever since the southern city was ad
mitted to the league three years ago
Morley has been a prominent figure in
the league and no one ever thought of
his resigning.
What the final result of the matter
will be is something unknown at the
present time. Many are of the opinion
that Morley will come into the fold
again when he is patted on the back
by the officers. The southern magnate
still retains his Interest in the team
and his resignation will in no wise
affect the nine, though Morley is the
largest stockholder.
The whole matter was' the result of
the action taken by the committee ia
awarding First Baseman Dillon to the
Brooklyn club. Morley was a member
x>f this committee and voted against
such a measure. When he was notified
that Dillon was lost to him his resig
nation was the result.
It has been forwarded to President
Bert of the league by wire, but so far
Bert has not accepted it. He is not
quite ready as yet and probably wants
to give Morley. another chance to make
up his mind finally. If Morley does
decide to stand pat the directors of the
Los Angeles Baseball Club will in ail
probability call a special meeting and
elect a successor t<xMorley.
â  It is thought likely* that John Brink,
who is acting temporarily in Morley's
place, will get the latter's job should
hp desire to take it. The baseball mag
nates here have nothing to say nor do
in the matter and apparently do not
care one way or another whether Mor
ley quits or stays with the ship.
. LOS ANGELES. Feb. 25. â The res
ignation of Manager James Morley of
the Los Angeles baseball team has not
yet been accepted by the board of di
rectors of the local association, and
this afternoon Director John Brink,
â who is acting as ex-officio chairman,
stated that it was likely that no meet
ing would be called until he had
heard from the officials of the Pacific
Coast League. He is awaiting an an
swer to his telegram sent to President
Bert denying the authority of the of
ficials to award Pacific Coast League
[ players to the National League. .
WILL SUCCEED COUNT
MUTSU AT WASHINGTON*
Secretary Eki Hiokl, Formerly At
tached to the Legation, Returns
From Lone Absence In Orient.
Eki Hioki, who is to succeed Count
Mutsu as first secretary of the Japan
ese legation at Washington, arrived
from Japan yesterday and is registered
at the Palace. Hioki fifteen years ago
was attached to the Japanese lega
tion at Washington and has since
served his country in the diplomatic
service at St. Petersburg and in China
and Korea. He was loth to discuss
the present war situation In the Far
East, stating in an apologetic "way
that the hostilities began on February
G and that three day3 later he had em
barked for this country.
"Since then," said he to a Call re
porter, "I have been on the high seas
and can tell you nothing that has not
already been conveyed to you through
your news sources."
When pressed further for some ex
pression of opinion as to the outcome
of the war between Japan and Rus
sia, he replied with a smile that Japan
would no doubt render a good account
of itself on both sea and land, for
she had been long preparing for war
and had. carefully measured her big op
ponent, especially in the matter of
forces, resources and the tactical
knowledge of the Russian command
ers.
Accompanying Secretary Hioki is
Heromichi Shugio, Imperial Japanese
commissioner to the St. Louis Exposi
tion, who will go direct to the latter
city. He stated yesterday that Japan
is preparing to send to the exposition
a larger and in many respects a finer
exhibit than she sent to the World's
Fair at Chicago, particularly in the
way of manufactured materials, min
erals and various agricultural pro
ducts.
Another member of the Hioki party
is J. Sakurai, Collector of Customs at
the port of Kobe, who has come to
this country for the purpose of mak
ing a study of our customs methods.
He expects to remain on the coast for
some time. -
Two other prominent Japanese wh<>
arrived on the same steamship are A,
Menikishi, who has been assigned to
Government duty in Panama arÂ»d
South America, and T. Kadoya, agent
of the Yokohama Specie Bank In New
York.'

DECENCY WINS
COURT BATTLE
Judi>e Hehbard Refuses tols
sue Injunction to Prevent
Police Raiding Xymphia
The i>olicp of Pan Francisco hp.ve a
perfect ripht to raid the Hotel Nymphia.
at 739 Pacific street, even if they have
to enter the place through the restau
rant kept by one Vincento Luccich, who
since January 16 last has. by the aid of
the injunction law, been endeavoring to
prevent the officers from entering the
resort. Judfre Hrbbard, in whose court
the injunction proceedings have been
pending, decided yesterday that the
restaurant was only a blind, that unless
the dens in the rear were allowed to re
main open its proprietor would be his
own best customer, and that therefore
it was maintained simply to cover the
entrance and exit of those who occu
pied the dens and visitors to the place.
In accordance with this decision he dis
solved the order temporarily restrain
ing the police from raiding the place,
and denied the motion of Luccich's at
torneys to make the injunction per
manent.
Judge Hebhard decided the matter
from the bench at the close of an ar
gument by the attorneys for the police,
Father Carraher and the restaurant
proprietor that lasted for several hours.
In denying the injunction he said:
"The record of the case prevents any
decision on the question of the right of
the police to arrest the women. â¢ The
court has simply to deal with the ques
tion of Luccich's connection with the
resort. The restaurant is an adjunct
and a name for an unlawful place of
business. The plaintiff comes into this
court beyond the pale of the law, and
the court cannot by injunction assist
the plaintiff in an unlawful business.
The temporary injunction issued by
this court is therefore dissolved, and
the motion for a permanent injunction
is denied."

TIMBER CASES
ARE DISMISSED
Nolle Prosequi Entered in
Favor of Engle and Other
Lumbermen of Sierra
In accordance with recent rulings of
United States Circuit Judge Grosscup
of Chicago, United States District
Judge Hanford of Seattle and of Judge
Rodgera of Arkansas, United States
Districr Judge de Haven yesterday
granted the of United States
District Attorney Woodworth for a
nolle prosequi in the case of the United
States against James M. Engle, Rich
ard II. Lewis, William 5- Lewis and
A. W. Keddie, indicted for subornation
of perjury in connection with certain
timber land entries in Sierra and Plu
mas counties.
Earlier in the day Bert Schlesinger,
counsel for the defendants, appeared
in court and asked that Saturday of
this week be set as^the day for the
trial. Shortly thereafter Assistant
United States Attorney Ben L.. Mc-
Kinlay moved that a nolle prosequi be
entered and the case dismissed.
Judge de Haven asked whether this
was one of the timber fraud cases In
which a conviction had been already
secured and Mr. McKinlay replied that
he was not familiar with the case, it
having been in charge of the late Ed
ward J. Banning when acting as As
sistant United States District Attorney,
and he would therefore refer the mo
tion to Mr. Woodworth.
WOODWORTH RENEWS MOTION'.
Mr. Woodworth then came in and re
newed the motion- He said that it
would be impossible to obtain a con
viction on the three materiJil counts in
the indictment, because witnesses who
had testified on the previous trial had
disappeared and the evidence at the
disposal of the prosecution was not
sufficient to warrant a verdict.
Judge de Haven remarked that thcr2
was enough evidence at the former
trial because the jury brought in a ver
dict of conviction.
Mr. Woodworth stated further that
he had authorities to show that should
another verdict of conviction be had in
the case it would not stand under the
recent decisions in United States
courts. i â¢ ;. -
"This Is a matter which you do on
your own responsibility," said Judge de
Haven. "I am only taking care to see
that the responsibility is placed where
it belongs. I require that the order,
which you want entered, be read in
court."
The order was read and the case
was thereupon dismissed.
The defendants were convicted sev
eral months ago, but Judge de Haven
granted them a new trial because he
had refused to give to the Jury the fol
lowing' instruction in accordance with
the decision of the United States Su
preme Court in the case of the United
States against Budd:
â¢ ARKANSAS DECISION;
"That before the defendants could be
convicted the proof must show that the
entrymen, before their application to
purchase, had made an agreement with
the defendants by which the title they
were to acquire from the United States
should Inure to the benefit of thft de
fendants."
The decision of Judge Rodgers of
Arkansas in a similar case is quoted,
among others, by United States Attor
ney Woodworth as a reason for dis
missing the case. The following is the
vital point:
"The fact that a lumber company lent
money without security to persons to
enable them to enter and pay for land
under the timber and stone act in the
expectation that when the entrymen
obtained title it would be enabled to
buy the timber from such lands by
reason of the fact that it had the only
mill in the vicinity does not render
the entries invalid for fraud where
there was ,no agreement for the sale
prior to the entries, but each man was
free to keep the timber or to sell it to
others; nor are such entries invalid
as made on 'speculation* because tin*
persons making them did so with the
intention of selling the timber for their
own benefit."

FREE MARKETS
FOR FLOWERS
Supervisors' Street Commit
tee IJecommendsPassage of
Bill Granting Privileges
The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday recommended the passage of
the proposed ordinance submitted by
the Merchants' Association providing
for the establishment of free public
flower markets at certain designated
points on public sidewalks. The peti
tion of the Merchants' Association was
supplemented- by a communication | of
the California Outdoor Art League urg
ing the passage of the ordinance.
The absence from the meeting of the
retail flower dealers, who are opposed
to the plan, was taken by the com
mittee as a sign that the former intend
to test the legality Of the ordinance,
claiming that It grants special privi
leges in violation of the charter in view
of Judge Murasky's recent decision re
moving: the bootblack stands from the
sidewalks: The Street Committee was
rather inclined to this opinion, but not
withstanding reported In favor of the
bill.
Supervisor Rock thought the grant
ing permission to flower venders to oc
cupy the sidewalks at Market and Pow
ell, Market and Third, Geary and Mar
ket* and Kear'ny and Geary streets, as
designated. by the ordinance, would re
result in the occupancy of too much
space, with the consequent obstruction
to pedestrian traffic.
"I favor the selling of flowers on the
streets," said Rock, "but the. people
should be considered and the sidewalks
should not be obstructed."
L. M. King, secretary of the Mer
chants' Association, spoke for the pas
sage of the ordinance. Supervisor
Braunhart favored one general location
for the sale of flowers, while Connor
thought there should be severaF loca
tions. Connor said fully 70 per cent of
the ilowers sold on the streets would
not be purchased in the flower stores.
Mrs. E. F. Glaser spoke for the Out
door Art League, stating that in Paris
there is a flower market where flow
ers can be purchased at a very low
price.
After hearing the argument the com
mittee voted In favor of the bill with
an amendment providing that no priv
ilege shall be granted to any flower
vender to stand within ten feet of the
property iine of so-called "gore" cor
ners. -.'â %'. \-\:\'
Steals a Large Turkey.

This invention has for its object the production of a novel lamp, particularly desirable for use as a (
' night lamp. Lamps for this purpose need not produce a laree flame; in fact, a comparatively small flame is {
1 more desirable, but it is also desirable that the lamp be capable of burning for a long period without refilling i
, and without attention and without emitting any odor. These results are positively obtained. Directions :

Tract
Go and see this block at once and secure
your choice. It is near the corner of First ave.

The block is exceptionally handsome and Is
level. The streets are graded, macadamized
and sewered, and everything ready for the
builder. A new feature has been Inaugurated
in the sale of this property In the enforcement
of the following restrictions, which are made
for the -protection of all and which, we have
no doubt -will add much to the value of the
land and be appreciated by all real home seek-
ers. Â»
No lot will be sold for any but residence
properties, including not more than two flats.
No stores, churches, stables, coal yards or
any objectionable buildings. The manner of
enforcing these restrictions â will be explained,
fully at our offl>e.
The Idea Is to make it possible for you to buy
a lot and build a home without being ruined
or damaged by neighboring buildings. Thou-
sands of people In this city who have built de-
sirable homes have had them ruined by three-
story flats, stores, coal yards, etc. Owing to
the restrictions and the large lots, this block
will be built up into select residence property
and will become very valuable.
It will pay you to buy a large lot instead of
a 25- foot lot. as you can save the price of the
extra land In the cost of your building, and be-
sides . this secure an abundance of light and
sun and build a more artistic home.
Our agent will be on the block Sunday with
diagram, or you may call at our office for
more complete Information. Bnt take our ad-
vice and see the property at once.

DORIC ARRIVES FROM THE FAR EAST
A DAY AHEAD OF HER SCHEDULE TIME
Liner Brings Many Passengers and Her Cargo Includes Part of
China's Exhibit for the World's Fair at St. Louisâ Has on
Board Japanese Gold Worth $1,02^,000 and Much Raw Silk
The first gun in the Russo-Japanese
war was fired the day the Occidental and
Oriental Steamship Company's liner
Doric left Yokohama, but those aboard
the steamship, which arrived here
yesterday, first learned at Honolulu of
the opening of hostilities. There was
little sign at the Japanese port of the
country being on the verge of war, and
so carefully did Russia's little opponent
hide her preparations that the news
of war being on was received on board
the liner with some surprise.
The Doric arrived a day ahead of her
schedule time, and made the run from
Hongkong in 27 days 6 hours, or twen
ty-four hours less than the correspond
ing trip last year. The Doric landed at
Honolulu 1055 tons of cargo and 301
passengers, 294 of them being Japanese.
She brought to this port a shipment of
Japanese gold yen valued at $1,025,000.
and raw silk worth more than $500,000.
She also brought 111 passengers, of
whom fifty-five were Asiatics.
Among the passengers were a num
fcer of prominent Japanese officials. E.
Hioki of the Japanese diplomatic corps
and his fellow countrymen in the cabin
were given a special dinner February
11 in honor of the accession to the
thfone of their first Emperor 2560 years
ago.
F. A. Carl of the Chinese imperial
customs service was a passenger on the
Doric and is going to St. Louis as a
commissioner in charge of China's ex
hibit at the World's Fair. D. Perce
bois, A. Berthet and L. Y. Fong will
assist Carl in his duties at the exposi
tion. About 544 tons of the Chinese ex
hibit formed part of the Doric's cargo.
The Doric was gayly decorated on
Washington's birthday and a special
dinner was served in honor of the day.
The passengers included the following
named :
O. J. Bainbridze, A. Berthet, L. G. Boyil,
Mrs. L. Brienaudy, Mrs. F. A. Carl. Kev.

storm in which the latter vessel was wrecked.
The- Sausalito will need considerable repair
ing before proceeding to her southern destina
tion. Captain Rasmussf-n reports that on Feb
ruary VI. at 4 p. m., in latitude 47 25 N. long
itude 125 19 W, the Sausalito encountered a
terrific southwester, accompanied by very high
seas. *She lost of her deckload 40,000 feet of
lumber? Her compass box and wheel box
were washed overboard and one big sea swept
away her figurehead. Foresail, staysail and
jib were gpllt and the rudder head was twisted
off.
Steamship Acapulco Arrives.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamship Aca
pulco, Captain Russell, arrived late yesterday
afternoon lrom Panama and way ports. Al

thirty-seven passengers and 950 tons of cargo,
including treasure valued at $58,277. She was

New York Stock Market
NEW YORK. Feb. 25. â The tentative effort
j to turn prices upward, which was in evidence
the day before In the etook market, met with
better sucreb* to-day. The more favorable
c.in<iiti<-ns came from abroad apaln. Just as
the adverse factors from that direction have
0>ne at the previous efforts to advance prices.
The improvement was of a negative character,
largely corseting In an amelioration of the de
pression abroad. The numerous failures which
occurred yesfrday among banking houses at
various points on the Continent served to clear
i h<> atmosphere and to create the Impression
that the Â«Â«;ik spots were now uncovered and
the mystery and f-uspense relieved. This was
evidently the vjÂ«w taken in the foreign mar
kets themselves. The extreme deprersion in
Ruffian KcuritieÂ«. which had been the cause
<>f financial troubles In France and Germany,
have Â»,e fn aggravated by the Japanese naval
KJccestes. and the latest affair at Port Ar
thur, which was something of an antidote to
thio. helped the bourses, which ure largely
committed to llu.-Â«:Â»in securities. The begin
ning of the fortnightly settlement in London
to-day failed to uncover any weak spots, and
this again disproved some of the fears which
!mve conduced to the recent weakness there.
Thfc-buyms of to-<lay was attributed largely u>
the sliott account. This assumption was batM
in part voon the fact that the turn in prices
came wltnout any change In the character of
I'M news or in'rxiating conditions. But un
changed condition*, eren when they are unfa
vorable, do not warrant an indefinite decline
in prices.
The professional traders have been watching
the market keenly for several days past for
signs that the now considerable decline had
reached proportions to satisfy the conditions
which ftarted it. or r.-hether. In their own
phraae, tht- market was oversold. Assertions
â ry made that there was some alight buying
from commission houses, attracted by the'low
level of rJl'ces. TSat it was not large is suffi- .
ciently attested in the volume of the market.
The further rise in wheat and the fall in cot.
ton were consistent in rebponse to the war in
Eastern Asia. T!,e early strength In etcrllng
exchange was an indfx of eome further pres
sure on the foroian money markets, but ex- ,
change easc-d^ off during the day on the real
ization that there may be considerable delay |
in tiie Panam* canal payments, owing to the i
â¢locations ral&<Hl In the French courts. There
was l*hs money offering here to loan on time
and tht denan-l for longer periods showed aii
BPprrcUbM Increase. The average of the day's
rains for the most active stocks was above a
point. St. Paul. Amalgamated Copper and
Jirooklyn Transit were the leaders of the mar- '
ket. an-1 I'nitcl States Hteel preferred did not â 
share rully in the strength. The closing was !

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Feb. 25.â Higher orices In the
English grain markets imparted strength to
wheat at the' onenlne. May started %@lc
higher, at $1 07Â©l 07%, while July, was %c
lower to %c higher, at 0(!Â®96%c. It was in
timated in a private crop -report that the
weather in various parts of the country had
be*n unfavorable to wheat, and this served
to make the pit crowd rather nervous. Toward
the end or the first hour the selling was of
such nn influential character that the . price
of May declined to $1 06% and July to 96c.
As soon as the selling stopped the market
became eironser .than befcie. Ofterings be
came extremely light late in the sepsion.
Whether correct or not, the belief gained
ground that wheat supplies would be very
limited before harvest. This, coupled with
the alarm in foreign markets over what a
spread of war may do, served to advance
prices ranidly until May touched $1 09 and
July sold un to !>8%c. Heavy liquidation oc
curred during the nnal few minutes of trad
ing. The result was to suddenly carry prices
downward, but the close was firm, with May
at $1 07%. July cloaed at 98%c.
The sentiment in the corn pit was somewhat
mixed. Tht close was about steady at 57%@
@57Vi c *<*â¢" M ft y-
The feÂ»turÂ»- in trading in oats was the
heavy selling by one. or two of . the . prtrnclpal
longs. May closed at 46%c.
1 There was a big general trade in provisions.
Tile feature of the market was the buying of
packers .>n<i the great scarcity of offerings.
The close was strong. May pork Bhowing a
gain of 32%c; lard was up- 10@l2%c, aod

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Butter continues very weak under excessive
supplier, and an aggressive bear element is
helping the market down. Offerings to shade
the quotations are numerous, nnd there is a
din rsitlrn among several large handlers to
j get 'the market down to a point where the
j Butter can be shipped and thereby got out
I 1 of the way as soon as possible. There is an
other element, still carrying lines of cold
storage goods, which is Interested In keep
flnc the market up as long as possible In or
der to work off those gooÂ«ls, and they are
giving' the bears a stubborn light. Between
these two contending force* accurate quota

low probably come as near the actual state of

From an Awftil Skin Humour.
Scratched Till Blood Ran.
Wasted to Skeleton.
CURED BY CUTICURA
One Application Soothed Htm to
Sleep. Cure Speedy
and Permanent.
" When my little boy was abont three
months old bis bead broke oat with a
rash, which was very Itchy and ran con-
siderable watery fluid. We tried every-
thing we could, but he got worse all the
time till it spread to his arms, legs, and
then to his entire body, and he got so
bad that ho came near dying. The rash
would itch so that he wonld scratch till
the blood ran, and a thin yellowish staff
woald be all over his pillow in the morn-
ing. I had to put mittens on his hands
to keep him from tearing his skin around
his wrists. He cot so weak and run
down that he took fainting spells like
wÂ« woald think him dying. He was al-
most a skeleton and his little hands
were thin like claws.
"He was bad <ibont eight months
when we tried Cuticura Remedies. I
had not laid him down in his cradle in
the daytime for a long time. He had
got so that be just slept In onr arms all
toe time. I washed him with Cuticnra
Soap and pat on one application of
Csticsra Ointment and he was so
soothed that I pat him in the cradle.
Ton don't know how glad I felt when he
felt better. It took one box of Cnticnra
Otntment, pretty near one cake of Coti-
cora Soap, and about hsjf a bottle of
Cottcora Resolvent, to cure. I think
oar little boy woald have died only for
the Cctteora Remedies, and I shall al-
ways remain a firm friend of them."

writes, under date of Feb. 24, 1903, that
the core Is permanent.
" It affords me mnch pleasure to in-
form you that it is fourteen years since
my boy was cared of the terrible ekin
disease from which he suffered.
" He has been permanently cured and

HEALTH BOARD
MAKES CHANGES
Accepts the Resignations of
Drs. J. L.Stephen, E v Mag
nus and J. Yon Werthern
NO FRICTION SAYS WARD
President of Department De
nies That Action Was Due
to Haste in Appointments
A number of resignations and new
appointments in the Health Depart
ment yesterday gave rise to the report
that there had been an upset as a
result of the discovery that the board
had been too hasty in some of its acts
at the begining.of the year. This, how
ever, was denied by Dr. James W.
Ward, president of the board, as well
as by the doctors concerned.
At its meeting yesterday 'the Board
of Health accepted the resignations of
Dr. J. I. Stephen, assistant chief sur
geon at the Emergency Hospital, who
has been acting in place of Chief Sur
geon Brackett during his absence in
the East; Dr. J,. von Werthern. assist
ant emergency surgeon; Dr. -M. E.
Magnus, assistant inspecting physician,
and C. Thompson, interne at the City
and County Hospital.
Dr. Ward said last evening that Dr.
Stephens' resignation was easily ex
plained. He had been appointed tem
porarily to take charge or Dv. jJiuck
ett's work while the latter was study
ing sanitary methods In Eastern cities,
and now that Brackett had returned.
Stephens' services were no longer re
quired. Hence hrS resignation was vol
untary and in line with his understand
ing at the time of his appointment.
Dr. von Werthern, it was explained,
resigned to attend to his private prac
tice, finding that he had not time for
this and the city work as well.
"The case of Dr. Magnus," said
Ward, "was a mistake on our part.
We were led to believe that he was a
practicing physician, whereas he has
never been licensed to practice. He
was appointed a week ago, and imme
diately afterward we learned that he
had no license. A day or two later he
was arrested at the instance of the
State Board of Medical Examiners.
We at once called for his resignation.
There was no politics in his apoint
ment, nor was there any in his arrest.
This action by the State board was
taken in the enforcement of rules which
I cordially approve.' Magnus resigned
ostensibly because he has not been in
practice during the last year; in fact
he has never been in practice, and his
appointment was an error due to mis
information. Of course we could not
keep him.
"We are getting the Health Depart
ment in fine shape." continued Dr.
Ward. "The weakest division of our
establishment has been the food in
spection department, but we are mak
ing it the strongest. This is one of
the most important matters for the
people of the city and the improve
ment will benefit all classes."
The board appointed Dr. C. F. Paw
licki .surgeon at the Emergency Hospi
tal: Dr. W. E. Buell, emergency sur
geon to succeed Dr. Painte'r. resigned:
Dr. O. S. Kusick. emergency surgeon
vice^Dr. von Werthern. and Dr. J. B.
Hannah Inspecting physician, vice Dr.
Magnus.
The salary of Dr. A. C. Bothe. med
ical chemist, was fixed at $175 per
month and that of H. C. Costa, indus
trial chemist, at $75.
F. Graham was appointed X-ray
operator at the City Hospital at a sal
ary of 540 per month.
J. W. Cameron was appointed night
clerk at the City Hospital at a salary
of $60 per month and George A. Watson
messenger.
The board adopted a resolution com
mending: Dr. Kasper Pischel for his vol
untary services as oculist at the Alms
house.
It was resolved that five medical
colleges be invited to recommend one
honorary consulting physician to the
.Almshouse for the privilege of holding
clinics. â¢
Heavy Damages for Imitating; a Liabel.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY, FEBRUARY . 26, 1904,
GRUNSKY WILL BE A MEMBER
OF ISTHMIAN CANAL BOARD
President Roosevelt Offers and the City Engineer Accepts
Appointment as One of Seven Members of Commis
sionâProspect That Preliminary |Work May Soon Begin
CITY ENGINEER OF SAN FRANCISCO. WHO HAS SIGNIFIED HIS
ACCEPTANCE OF THE APPOINTMENT AS MEMBER OF PANAMA
COMMISSION, TENDERED BY PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT.
WHITE HOUSE,
WASHINGTON. D. C, Feb. 25.
C. E. GRUNSKY. CITY HALL,
SAN FRANCISCO, CAL.:
1 desire to appoint j-ou on
the Isthmian Cnnal Commission.
Will you accept? Please ad-
vise bj* wire.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
The foregoing correspondence, which
â¢passed over the wire yesterday morn
ing, indicates that the present City En
gineer of San Francisco, Carl Ewalu
Grunsky, is to be the representative of
the Pacific Coast among the seven
members of the Panama Canal Com
mission. The appointment is recognized
by all classes in the community as one
eminently fit to be made. As soon as
it shall have been confirmed by the
Senate Mr. Grunsky will resign his of
fice at the City Hall, leaving that posi
tion to be filled by the Board of Public
Works.
President Roosevelt is believed to
have acted at the instance of leading
engineers on the coast, among whom
Mr. Grunpky holds high rank. The
place was offered to Judge John Garber,
who declined it for personal reasons.
Mayor Warren Olney of Oakland ->vas
also mentioned for it. Senator Perkins
warmly indorsing him. The selection <>f
Grunsky is said to be due to the Presi
dent's opinion that the eommissiort,
should be strong in practical engineers.
Grunsky's acceptance of the post leaves
only one other Commissioner to be se
lected, according to yesterday's Wash
ington dispatches. These announced
that the President had received definite
acceptances from five of his appointees,
namely, Rear Admiral John G. Walker,
U. S. N., retired, who was at the head
of the former canal commission 'that
reported upon the practicability of the
Panama route: General George W. Da
vis. U. S. A., retired; Colonel Frank
Hecker of Detroit, director of trans
portation during the Spanish-American
war; William Barclay Parsons, en
gineer of the great subway which is
now nearing completion in New York,
and Professor William' H. Burr, he.i'l
of the engineering department in thp
school of mines, Columbia University,
New York, who was a member of tha
Walker Isthmian Canal. Commission. It
was also asserted that the South would
probably be represented on the commis
sion by Benjamin M. Harrod , of- Nen'
SAX FKAXCISCO, Feb. 25.
THE PRESIDENT, WASH-
INGTON, D. C:
I will nccept the appointment,
appreciating fuHy the honor
% conferred and the responsibili-
ties of the position.
feC. E. GRUXSKY.
Orleans, engineer* of "the Mississippi
River Commission and builder of the
city sewerage and water supply systems

HONORABLE DISTINCTION".
j Membership upon such a board
is an honor which any profes
sional man might well covet, and Mr.
Grunsky was kept busy all day answer
ing telephone calls that brought him
I the congratulations of men well known
in his profession and of leaders in the
business community. San Francisco en
gineers were especially pleased with
the news that the man whose'availabil
ity they had called to the President's
attention had been chosen for a position
of international importance. The com
pletion of the Panama canal by the
American nation after the failure of
the French to carry out the undertak
ing will be one of the most noteworthy
achievements in the history of the*
world's work, and participation in 'it
may well be deemed the distinction of
a lifetime. That San Francisco's City
Engineer has been selected for one of
these much sought appointments Is
creditable alike to the city and the ap
pointee.
As City Engineer Mr. Grunsky's sal
ary ha.-: been $5000. It was said yester
.day that the compensation to be paid
members 'of the isthmian comhiission
had not been announced, but that it
would be fixed by the President and
would probably be in excess of $10,000
por annum. The appointment is under
stood to bo for the full term of the
canal construction, which may cover a
period of ten years. Even after the
opening of the canal there will doubt
*)esf5 be much further work to be done.
Hence the nositton to which Mr. Grun
sky has been called may become a life
appointment. In any case his connec
tion with the canal will give him an en
viable rank among the leaders of the
engineering profession throughout the
world, â - - â¢ - â¢ â¢- , ; -
PROSPECT OF EARLY WORK.
The promptness with which Presi
dent Roosevelt has acted in selecting
the members of the commission prom
ises . an -early, beginning of the great
undertaking. â¢ There will, of course, be
an immense amount of preliminary
work, including the organization of the
board and Jta staff of constructing en
gineers, surveys of the uncompleted
work of the French company and the
preparation of plans for the comple
tion of the. canal. But Mr. Grunsky
said yesterday, that he expected little
time would be lost by the commission
in organizing and getting down to the
real work of the. vast enterprise. He
had as yet made no special prepara
tion for the duties of the office, he add
ed, and had no opinions to announce
regarding plans, routes or methods of
construction, but would give his whole
time to these matters as soon as his
appointment was made certain.
"I presume the bulk of the commis
sion's, work," he said, "will be done in
the United States, possibly, at head
quarters in Washington, but when con
struction is' actually begun it will be
necessary for a time that more than
one of the Commissioners be on the
ground, at Panama. We shall prob
ably take turns in this duty, so that
permanent residence there will not be
required. No, I am not afraid of. the
climate nor of the unsanitary, condi
tions at the isthmus.-. Our first im
portant work, of course, will be sanita
tion. What has been done at Havana
will have to.be repeated there, ! and I
am confident American engineers will
achieve the same success at. Panama
that. they won in the West Indies. The
world will not be shocked by the fright-,
ful loss of life which marked the French
regime en the" isthmus. I have never
entertained, the least doubt of the feasi
bility", of. the canal."
GIUTNSKY'S CAREER.
Mr. Grunsky* was born in San Joa
quin, County in-1855. and educated. at
the Stockton High School and later at
the . Polytechnic' Institute at Stuttgart,
Germany. , In 1878 he , entered the State
Engineer's 'office, remaining there for
nine years and becoming assist-'
ONION LEAGUE
TO THE FRONT
Club Proposes a Love Feast
on Occasion of Republican
State Committee Meeting
MAPLE ftOOM IS ENGAGED
Indications That Organiza
tion Will Lease Premises
Occupied by Pacific-Union
The Republican State Central Com
mittee will meet in this city on Satur
day, March 12, at 2 p. m. It Is ex
pected that a large number of com
mittee members from interior coun
ties will be in San Francisco on that
occasion, and nq doubt active Repub
licans other | than those immediately
connected with the governing body of
the party will join the throng. The
Union League Club has engaged the
Maple room of the Palace Hotel for
the evening of March 12, and
a Republican dinner will be given
then and there under the aus
pices of the league. Well-known
Republicans of Los Angeles, Oak
land, San Jos*, Stockton, Sacra
mento, Santa Rosa, Napa, Vallejo and
Eureka have already indicated a de-
Bire to b* present at the dinner. The
banquet will not be limited to the mem
bership of the league, as each mem
ber will be entitled to invite resident
or non-resident Republicans who do
not belong to the club. ..
It seems to be very nearly settled
that the Union. League will lease the
house now occupied by the Pacific-
Union Club and move in early next
winter. ,The committee recently ap
pointed by the league has gone over the
ground carefully' with Mr. Burbank,
the owner of the premises, northwest
corner of Post and Stockton streets. M.
H. de Young is the leading representa
tive of the league Jn the negotiations,
and it is reported that he has obtained
concessions from the owner of the
building which will justify the club in
taking a lease of the house.
There will be a general meeting of
the league membership next Tuesday
evening, and at that time the commit
tee will present a report of the con
ferences with Mr. Burbank. The abil
ity of the Union League to enlarge Its
membership to 1000 by the first of next
December is not doubted. It is the
impression that the dues must be rais
ed to ?5 a month, but the increase may
apply' only to city members or others
in proximity to San Francisco.
It is calculated that the new home
of the Pacific-Union Club will be
ready for occupancy by the first of
next November. Two months later the
Union League could probably move to
the premises vacated by the Pacific-
Union. The league, however, must see
its way clear to pay $16,000 per annum
for 'rent and also expend a good round
sum of money for furniture and gen
eral equipment of the house.

vey. These are but a few of his pro

Never active in politics, although a
life-long Republican. Mr.. Grunsky was
appointed City Engineer in 1900 by the
Phelan Board of Public Works and has
since continued in that office. Owing
to the important municipal undertak
ings In contemplation during his term
he has probably accomplished a great
er amount of noteworthy work than
any of his predecessors. This includes
the investigation of the San Francisco
water supply, reports on the Tuolumne
River project and the proposed munic
ipal gas, electric lighting:, telephone and
street railway systems. He is a mem
ber of the German General Benevolent
Society and the American Society of
Civil Engineers, trustee of the Califor
nia Academy of Sciences and ex-presi
dent of the Technical Society of the
Pacific Coast. He is also on the roll of
the Native Sons.
Mayor Schmitz said yesterday that he
had not considered the matter of Mr.
Grunsky's successor as City Engineer.
Mayor Olney Explains.
OAKLAND, Feb. 25. â Mayor War
ren- Olney to-day explained why hts
name was mentioned in connection
with possible appointment to the Pan
ama Canal Commission. Mayor Olney
said:
"I received a telegram last Monday
from Senator Perkins stating that he
had presented my name to the Presi
dent for appointment on the Panama
Canal Commission and that the ques
tion in the mind of the President was
whether to appoint a lawyer or an
engineer from the Pacific Coast; that
if he decided to appoint a lawyer I
would probably be the man, and urged
me to accept. I replied that while
not at all desirous of the appointment,
I should accept if it were tendered."

DECLARES LESTER WAS
ILLEGALLY DISMISSED
City Attorney Long Advises the Fire
Commissioners That They Vio
lated the Charter.
City Attorney Long yesterday filed
an .opinion with the Fire Commission
to the effect that .the dismissal of
Frank Lester from his jjosition in the
corporation yard was invaUd and that
he is entitled to compensation from
the date of such dismissal until he
voluntarily resigned his position.
After quoting the charter that no em
ploye of- the Fire Department shall be
dismissed except for cause until after
a trial before the Commissioners,
Long says in his opinion:
Lester appears to have been dismissed con
trary to the terms of the charter, and so
held the legal title to his position until he
formally reslsnert it. Holding the Rgal
title to the position, he was entitled as a
matter of right to the compensation incident
to the position,- hot alone until he took Qth?r
employment, but until he legally lost his mem
bership in the department through his resig
nation. Under the doctrine of the caee of
Fitzslmmons vs. the City of Brooklyn. MM
N. Y., K>t>. and other cases, he was entitled
to the salary in full, despite the fact that
he earned money from other sources during the
time he was Illegally deprived of his position
In the department. In other words his earn
ing on the outside cannot be deducted from
the salary to which he was entitled as a
member of- the department from the time he
became a member until his membership legally
ceased. Had Mr. Lester been valldly dis
missed â that Ss. upon charges preferred and
after trial, as required by the charter, his right
to salary would have ended with hia dis
missal. â¢
