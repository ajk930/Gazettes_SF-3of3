{ Â£ T""TROM the point of view of the
Iâ I criminal expert," said Mr.
I Sherlock Holmes, "London
JL has become a singularly un
interesting city ulnce the death of the
late lamented Professor Moiiarty."
**I can hardly think that you would
flnfi many decent citizens to agree with
you," I answered.
"Well, well, I must not be selfish,"
said he, â¢with a emile, as he pushed
back his chair from the breakfast
table. "The community is certainly
the gainer, and no one the loser, save
the poor out-of-work specialist, whose
occupation has gone. With that man
in the field, one's morning paper pre
sented infinite possibilities. Often It
was only the smallest trace, Watson
the faintest Indication, and yet it was
enough to tell me that the great
malignant brain was there, as the gen
tlest tremors of the edges of the web
remind oni of the foul spi ier which
lurks In the center. Petty iliefta. wan
ton assaults, purposeless outragÂ»*â to
the man who held the clew ail could be
worked into one connected whole. To
the scientific student of the higher
criminal world, no capital In Europe
offered the advantages which London
then possessed. But nowâ" He
shrugged his shoulders In humorous
deprecation of the state of things
which he had hlmtelf done so much
to produce.
At the time of which I speak. Holmes
had been back for some months, and
I at his request had sold my prac
tice and returned to share the old
quarters on Baker street. A young
doctor, named Verner, had purchased
my small Kensington practice, and
given with astonishing little demur the
highest price that I ventured to askâ
an incident which only explained It
self some years later, when I found
that Verner was a distant relation of
Holmes, and that It was my friend who
had really found the money.
Our months of partnership had not
been so uneventful as he had stated.
for I find, on looking over my notes!
that this period Includes the case of
the papers of ex-President Murlllo, and
also the shocking affair of the Dutch
steamship Friesland, which so nearly
cost us both our lives. Hie cold and
proud nature vras always averse, how
ever, to anything In the shape of
public applause, and he bound me in
the most stringent tÂ»rms to say no
further word of himself, his methods,
or his successes â a. prohibition which,
as I have explained, has only now
been removed.
Mr. Sherlock Holmes was leaning
back in his chair after his whimsical
protest, and was unfolding his morn
ing paper in a leisurely fashion, when
The Sunday Call Magazine.
THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES
THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER
our Attention was arrested by a tre
mendous ring at the bell, followed im
mediately by a hollow drumming
sound, as if some one were beating
on the outer door with his fist. As it
opened there came a tumultuous rush
into the hall, rapid feet clattered up
the Ftair. and an instant later a wild
eyed and frantic young man,
pale. disheveled, and palpitating,
burst Into the ' room. He looked
from one to the other of us, and
under our gaze olf inquiry he became
conscious that some apology was need
ed for this, unceremonious entry.
"I'm sorry. Mr. Holmes," he cried.
"You mustn't blame me. I am nearly
mad. Mr. Holmes, I am the unhappy,
John Hector McFarlane."
He made the announcement as if
the name alone would explain both his
visit and Its manner, but I could see,
by my companion's unresponsive face,
that It meant no more to him than to
me.
"Have a cigarette. Mr. MeFarlane,"
said he, pushing his case across. "I am
sure that, with your symptoms, my
friend Dr. Watson here would pre
scribe a sedative. The weather has
been so very warm these last few days.
Now if you feel a little more com
posed I should be glad' If you would sit
down in that chair and tell us very
slowly and quietly who you are and
what It Is that you want. You men
tioned your name, as If I should rec
ognize It. but I assnre you that beyond
the obvious facts that you are a bach
elor, a solicitor, a Freemason and an
asthmatic, I know nothing whatever
about you."
Familiar as I was with my friend's
methods it was not difficult for me to
follow his deductions and to observe
the untidiness of attire, the sheaf of
legal papers, the watch charm and the
breathing which had prompted them.
Our client, however, stared In amaze
ment.
"Yea. I am all that, Mr. Holmes, and,
in addition, I am the most unfortunate
man at this moment In London. For
heaven's sake don't abandon me, Mr.
Holmes! If they come to arrest me be
fore I have finished my story make
them give me time so that I may tell
you the whole truth. I could go to gaol
happy if I knew that you were work
ing for me outside."
"Arrest you!" said Holmes. "This is
really most gratiâ most Interesting.
On what charge do you expect to be
arrested?"
"Upon the charge of murdering Mr.
Jonas Oldacre of Lower Norwood."
My companion's expressive face
showed a sympathy which was not, I
am afraid, entirely unmixed with sat
isfaction.
"Dear me," said he, "It was only this
morning at breakfast that I was say
ing to my friend. Dr. Watson, that
sensational cases had disappeared out
of oar papers."
Our visitor stretched forward a
quivering hand and picked up the
Daily Telegraph, which still lay upon
Holmes' knee,
"If you had looked at it. sir, you
would have seen at a glance what the
errand is on which I have come to you
this morning. 1 feel as if my name and
my misfortune must be In every man's
mouth." He turned it over to expose
the central page. "Here it is, and with
your permission I will read it to you.
Listen to this, Mr. Holmes. The head
lines are: 'Mysterious Affair at Lower
Norwood. Disappearance of a Well
known Builder. Suspicion of Murder
md Arson. A Clew to the Criminal.'
.That is the clew which they are al
ready following, Mr. Holmes, and I
tnow that it leads infallibly to me. I
have been followed from London bridge
3tation, and I am sure that they are
inly waiting for the warrant to arrest
me. It will break my mother's heart
-it will break her heart!" He wrung
his hands In an agony of apprehension
md swayed backward and forward
In his chair.
I looked with interest upon this man
who was accused of being the perpe
trator of a crime of violence. He was
flaxen-haired and handsome in a
svashed-out negative fashion, with
frightened blue eyes and a clean-shav
?n face, with a weak, sensitive mouth.
His age may have been about 27,
Ills dress and bearing that of a gentle
man. From the pocket of his light
summer overcoat protruded the bundle
3f indorsed papers which proclaimed
his profession.
"We must use what time we have,"
said Holmes. "Watson, would you
have the kindness to take the paper
and to read the paragraph in ques
tion?"
Underneath the vigorous headlines
which our client had quoted, I read the
following suggestive narrative:
"Late last-night, or early this morn^
ing, an incident occurred at Lower
Norwood which points, it is feared, to
a serious crime. Mr. Jonas Oldacro is a
(veil-known resident of that suburb,
tvhere he has carried on his business
is a builder for many years. Mr.
Dldacre is a bachelor, fifty-two years
jf age, and lives In Deep Dene House,
it the Sydenham end of the road of
that name. He has had the reputation
jf being a man of eccentric habits,
secretive and retiring. For some years
le has practically withdrawn from the
A. CONAN DOYLE
business, in which he is said to hayÂ«
amassed considerable wealth. A small
timber yard still exists, however, at
the back of the house, and last night,
about 12 o'clock, an alarm was given
that one of the stacks was on fire.
The engines were soon upon the spot,
but the dry wood burned with great
fury, and it was impossible to arrest
the conflagration until the stack had
been entirely consumed. Up to this
point the incident bore the appearance
of an ordinary accident, but fresh indi
cations seem to point to serious crime.
Surprise was expressed at. the absence
of the master of the establishment
from the scene of the fire, and an in
quiry followed, which showed that he
had disappeared from the house. An
examination of his room revealed that
the bed had not been slept in, that -a
safe which stood in it was open, that
a number of important papers were
scattered about the room, and, finally,
that there were signs of a murderous
Btruggle, slight traces of blood being
found within the room, and an oaken
walking stick, which also showed
stains of blood upon the handle. It is
known that Mr. Jonas Oldacre had re
ceived a late visitor In his bedroom
upon that night, and the stick found
has been Identified as the property of
this person, who Is a young London
solicitor named John Hector McTTar
lane, Junior partner of Graham &
McFarlane, of 426 Gresham Buildings.
E. C. The police believe that they have
evidence in their possession which sup
plies a very convincing motive for the
crime, and altogether It cannot be
doubted that sensational developments
will follow.
"Later. â It is rumored as we go to
press that Mr. John Hector McFarlane
has actually been arrested on the
charge of the murder of Mr. Jonas Old
1
acre. It is at least certain that a war
rant has been issued. There have been
further and sinister developments in
the investigation at Norwood. Besides
the signs of a struggle in the room of
the unfortunate builder it is now
known that the French windows of his
bedroom (which is on the ground
floor) were found to be open, that there
were marks as if some bulky object
had been dragged across to the wood
pile, and, finally, it is asserted that
charred remalr-s have been found
among the charcoal ashes of the fire.
The pc-lice theory is that a most sen
sational crime has been committed,
that the victim was clubbed to death
in his own bedroom, his papers rifled,
and his dead body dragged across to
the woodstaek, which was then ignited
co as to hide all traces of the crime.
The conduct of the criminal investiga
tion has been left in the experienced
hands of Inspector Lestrade of Scot
land Yard, who is following up the
clews with his accustomed energy and
sagacity. "
Sherlock Holmes listened with closed
eyes and finger-tips together to this re
markable account.
"The case has certainly some points
of interest," said he, in his languid
fashion. "May I ask, in the first place,
Mr. McFarlane, how it is that you are
still at liberty, since there appears to
be enough evidence to justify your
arrest?"
"I live at Torrington Lodge, Black
heath, with -my parents', Mr. Holmes,
but last night, having to do business
very late with Mr. Jonas Oldacre, I
stayed at a hotel in Norwood, and
came to- my business from there. I
knew nothing of this affair until I was
In the train, when I read what you
have Just heard. I at once saw the
horrible danger of my positon, and I
hurried to put the case into your
hands. I have no doubt that I should
have been arrested either at my city
office or at my home. A man followed
m e from London bridge station, and I
have no doubtâ Great Heavens! what
Is that?"
It was a clang of the bell, followed
Instantly by heavy steps upon thÂ«
stair. A moment later our old friend
Lestrade appeared In the doorway.
Over his shoulder I caught a glimpse
of one or two uniformed policemen out
side.
â¢ "Mr. John Hector McFarlane?" said
Lestrade.
Our unfortunate client rose with a
ghastly face.
"I, arrest you for the illful murder
of Mr. Jonas Oldacre of Lower Nor
wood."
McFarlane turned to us with a ges
ture of despair and sank into his chair
once more hke one who is -rushed.
"One moment. Lestrade." said
Holmes. "Half an hour more or less
can make no difference to you, and the
gentleman was about to give us an
account of this very Interesting affair,
which might aid us in clearing It up."
"I think there will be no difficulty In
clearing it up," said Lestrade, grimly.
"None the less, with your permis
sion. I should be much interested to
hear his account."
"Well, Mr. Holmes, it is difficult for
me to refuse you anything, for you
have been of use to the force once or
twice in the past, and we owe you a
good turn at Scotland Yard," said Les
trade. "At the same time I must re
main with my prisoner, and I am
bound to warn him that anything he
may., say will appear in evidence
against him."
"I wish nothing better," said our
client. "All I ask Is that 70a timid
hear and recocnlze the abs. *XtÂ» truH^"
Lestrade looked at his Â» itch. 'M7U

"I must explain first." . McFar

Imagine my astonishment when I
found that, with torn! reservations;, he
had left all his property to me. He
was a strange little ferret-like man, '
with white eyelashes, and when I luok
ed up at him I found his keen,' gray
eyes fixed , upon â me with an r amused
expression. ~ I could hardly believe my
own senses as I read tha terms of the
will; but ha explained that he was a

man, and was assured that. his money

I could only stammer out* mv thanks.
The will was duly finished, signed and
witnessed- by :my clerk. This Is it on
the blue paper, . and these slips, as I
have explained, are the rough, draft.
Mr. Jonas OMacre then 'informed 1 - me Â«*i
that, there were a number of documents I

was necessary that I should see and

"One moment!" said Holmes. "Who

"A middle-aged woman, who was, I :
suppose, his housekeeper."
, "And It was she, I presume^ who
mentioned, your name?'.*
"Exactly," said McFarlane.
"Pray proceed."
McFarlane wTped his damp brow, and
then continued his narrative: . "'â â

points. Granting that bit. â¼*$!â¢ Jour-ney was occupied In drawing up the
will, then the train was an express,
only stopping once between Norwood
and London Bridge."
Lestrade began to laugh.
"You ire too many for me when you
begin to get on your theories, Mr.
Holmes," said he. "How does this bear
on the case?"
"Well, it corroborates the young
Iran's story to the extent that the will
was drawn up by Jonas Oldacre in his
Journey yesterday. It Is curiousâ is it
not?â a man should draw up so
Important a document in so haphazard
a fashion. It suggests that he did not
think it was going to be of much prac- -
tical importance. If a man drew up a
will which he did not intend ever to be
effective, ho mig;ht do it so."
"Well, he drew up his own death
warrant at the same time," said. L:
strade.
"Oh, you think so?"
"Don't you?"
"Well. it is Quite possible, but the
case is not clear to me vet."
"Not clear? Well, if that isn't clear,
".That fi .''d be clear? Here is a young
rrs. iij "sr ho }enrrs suddenly that, if a
cciv in â >.-. " â¢ r-ao dies, he will succeed
to a fo.\ Â«t: ,^yi v hat does he do? He
J- iy*y-B6*Â£iÂ£ i jÂ£ t'i any one, but he ar
'â ST-'ses tha" he shall go out on some
pretext tO/^e his client that night. He
watte vi. .il the .only other person in
the hou^ is in bed. and then in the sol
i liCe < i the .man's room he murders
hrrFÂ«, J^ras his body in the woodpile
arid 'it parts to a neighboring hotel.
The b!ood-stalns in the room and also
on the stick are very slight.. It is prob
able that he imagined his crime to be
a blocHllees one. and hoped that if
the body were consumed it would hide
all traces of the method of his death â
traces which, for .some reason, must
have pointed to him. Is not all this -
obvious?"
"It strikes me. my good Lsatrade, as
being just a trifle too obvious." said
Holmes. "You do not add imagination
to your other great Qualities, but if
you could for one moment put your
self-In the place of this young man
â¢would you choose the very night after
the will had been made to commit your
crime".' Wuuld it not seem dangerous
to you to xr.ake so very close a relation
between the two Incidents? Again,
would you choose an occasion when
you are known to be in the house,
when a servant has let you in? And,
finally, would you take the great pains
to conceal the body, and yet leave your
own stick as a sign that you were the
criminal? Confess. Lestra.de, that all
this is very unlikely."
"As to the stick, Mr. Holmes, you
know as well as I do that a criminal is
often flurried, and does such things,
which a coo! man would avoid. He
â¢was very likely afraid to go back to
the room. Give me another theory that
would fit the facts."
"I could verr easily give you half a
dozen." said Holmes. "â¢Here, for ex
amp â  is a very possible and even
probable one. I make you a free pres
ent of it. The older man Is showing
documents which are of evident value.
A pas-sing tramp sees them through the
window, the blind of which Is only
half down. Exit the solicitor. Enter
the tram:>! He seizes a stick, which
he observes there, kills Oldacre, and
departs after ' urnir.g the bod:.'"
' "Why should the tramp burn the
body ?",;.. -s.W ;V\-"; J r
"For the matter of that, why should
McFarlai < ;
' â¢ "To hide some evidence."
" -Possibly the tramp wanted to hide
that any murder at all had been com
mitted."
"And why did the tramp take
nothing?"
"Because they were papers that he
could not negotiate." â¢
Lestr.ide shook his head, though it
seemed â¢â < me that his manner was
less absolutely assured than before.
"Well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you
may look for your tramp, and while
you are finding him we will hold on
to our man. The future will show
which is right. Just notice this point,
Mr. Holmes: that so far as we know
none of the papers were removed,
and that the prisoner is the one man
In the world who had no reason for
removing them, since he was heir-at
law and would come into them in any
case."
My Friend seemed struck by this re
mark.
-.*;*'! d n't mean to deny that the evi
dence !â  in some ways very strongly
In favor of your theory," said he. "1
only wish to point out that there are
other theories possible. As you say,
the future will decide. Good morn
ing! I dare say that In the course of
the day I shall drop in at Norwood
and see how you are getting on."
"When the detective departed my
friend rose and made his preparations
for the day's work with the alert air
of a m.-. â  ho has a congenial task be
fore him.
"My first movement. Watson," said
he, as he bustled into his frock coat,
"must, as I said, -be in the direction of
Blackhotxth." .* /
"And why not Norwood?"
"Because we have In this case one
singular incident coming close to the
heels of another singular incident.
The police are making the mistake of
concentrating their attention upon the
â¢second, because it happens to ;be the
one which Is actually criminal. But
it Is evident to me that the logical
â¢way to approach the case is to begin
by trying to throw some light upon
the first incidentâ the curious will, so
suddenly made, and to so unexpected
an heir. It may do something to sim
plify what followed. No, my dear
fellow, I don't think you can help me.
There is no prospect of danger or I
6hould not dream of stirring out with
out you. 1 trust that when I see you
In the evening I will be able to report
that I have been able to do something

has thrown himself upon my protec
tion."
It was' late when my friend returned
and I could see by a glance at his hag
gard and anxious face that \ the high
hopes with which he had started had
not been fulfilled. For an hour he
droned away upon his violin, endeav
oring to soothe" his own ruffled spirits.
At last he flung down the Instrument
and plunged ; into a detailed' account
of his misadventures. ; , , , /
"It's all going wrong. Watsonâ
as wrong as it could go." I kept a bold
face . before Lestrade, but. upon '- my
soul, â¢ I . believe that * for once the â¢ fel

on the wrong.- AH my instincts are
one way and all the facts are the

preference .to \ my/ theories . over Ls
tradeTs*facts.** . : . ' -
"Did you go to Blackheath?" .
"Yes, Watson, I : went there -and
I found very quickly that the late la
mented Oldacre was a pretty consid- .
erable blackguard. The father was
away In search of his son. The moth
er was at horne â a little, fluffy, blue
eyed person, In :a t tremor â¢' of â  fear v
and indignation. jOf course, she would :â â¢
not admit even the possibility of his v
guilt. But she' would . not express " '

of Olda'cre. On the f contrary, she
spoke of him with such bitterness that
she was unconsciously considerably
strengthening the; case of the police, â¢
for, of course, if " her son -had heard
her speak of the man in this fashion, .
it would predispose him toward hatred
and violence. "He was more like a
malignant and cunning ape than a hu
man being,' said she, 'and he always
was, ever since he was a young man.'
'You knew him at 1 that time?"
aid I.
" * Yes, I knew him well, in fact, he
was an old suitor of mine. Thank
heaven, that I had the sense to turn
away from him and to marry a better,
if poorer, man. . I was engaged to him,
Mr. Holmes, when 1 heard of a shock
ing story of how he had turned a cat
loose in an aviary, and I was so hor
rified at this brutal cruelty that I
would have nothing more to do with
him.' She rummaged in a bureau and
presently she produced a photograph
or a woman, shamefully defaced: and
mutilated with a knife. "That is my
own photograph," she said. 'He sent
it to me in that state, with his curse,
upon my wedding morning.' ,
".'Well.' said I, 'at least he has for
given you now, since he has left all
hi* property to your son.'
" 'Neither my son nor I want any
thing from Jonas Oldacre, dead or
alive!' she cried, with a proper spirit.
"There is a God . in heaven. Mr.
.Holmes, and that same God who has
punished that wicked man will show,
hi his own good time, that my son's
hands are guiltless of his blood.'
"Well. I tried one or two leads, but
could get at nothing which would help
our hypothesis and several points
which would make against it.. I gave
it up at last and off 1 went to Nor
wood.
"This place. Deep Dene House, is a
big modern villa of . staring brick,
standing back in its own grounds,
with a laurel-clumped lawn in ffrontt t
of it. To the right and some distance
back from the road was the timber
yard which had been the scene of the
fire. Here's a rough plan on a leaf, of .
my notebook. This window on the
left is 1 the one which opens into Old
acre's roc-m. You can look into it from
the road, you see. This is about the
only bit of consolation I have had to
day. Lestrade was not there, but his
head constable did the honors. They
just found â  great treasure trove. They
had spent the morning raking among
the ashes of the burned woodpile, and,
besides the charred organic remains.
they had secured several discolored
metal disks. I examined , them with
care, and there was no doubt that
they were trousers buttons. T even

with an Augrr.-' srur-. -on â my. back/tbiit
I got up at 'Jlhe end â of an hour ni)
V i^er than before.
"Well, after; this ftai 1 I %vent into
the bedroom. and examined that also.
The blood-stains were very slight,
mere smears and discoloraiions, but
undoubtedly fresh.' # The stick had
been removed, but there also the
marks were slight. There is no doubt
about the stick belonging to our client.
He admits it. Footmarks of both
men could be made out on the carpet,
but none of. any third person, which
again is a trick for the other side. '=
They were piling up their score all
the time, and we were at a standstill.
"Only one little gleam of hope did I
get â and yet it amounted to nothing.
I examined the contents of the safe,
most of which had been taken out and
left on the table. The papers had
been made ur> . into sealed envelopes, .
one or two of which had been opened
by the police. * They were not, so far
as 1 could judge, of any great value,
nor did the bank-book show that Mr.
Oldacre was in such very affluent cir
cumstances. But it seemed to me that
all the capers were not there. There
were allusions to some â pos
sibly the more valuableâ which ] '...l
could not find. This, of course, if we
could definitely prove it, would turn
Lestrade's argument against himself;
for who would steal a thing if he ;
knew that he would shortly, inherit it?
"Finally, having drawn every other
cover and picked up no scent, I tried
my luck with the housekeeper. Mrs.
Lexington is her name â a little, dark,
silent person, with suspicious and
sidelong eyes. She could tell us'
something if she wouldâ l: am ; con
vinced of it. But she was as close as
wax. Yes, she had let Mr. McFar
lane in at half-past nine. :â¢ She wished
her hand had withered before she had
done so. She had gone to bed at half
past ten. Her room was at the other
end of the house, and she could hear
nothing of what passed. :. : Mr. McFar
lane had left his ; hat, and to the best
of her belief his stick, : in the \ hall.
â  She had been awakened by the alarm
of fire. Her poor, dear master. had
certainly been murdered. , Had he any
enemies? Well, every man had ene
mies, but Mr. .: Oldacre '; kept himself
very much 'to himself, and only ; met
people in the way of business. Sh.e
had seen the buttons,. and was sure
that they â  belonged" to .' the clothes
which he had worn: last night. The
wood-pile was very dry, for it had 1 not
rained for a month. : It burned i like
tinder, . and by the time she reached
the spot, nothing could be Been but
flames. She and !: all \ , the I : . firemen
. Bmelled . the â¢â  burning flesh : from inside :
it. She I knew " nothing !of ; the papers, ;
nor of Mr. Oldacre's private affairs.
"So, ; my dear Watson, * there's my i
. report of a failure. And yet â and yet
â " â he . clenched > his thin hands in a
" paroxysm of conviction â "I i know: it's
all wrong. ' I feel it in '.;"my'l bones.
, There is something that has not come
out. and : that i housekeeper knows ; it.
There was " a sort tof ; sulky defiance â ' in ;
her eyes, which only goes with guilty
knowledge. .However, there's no good
talking any more . about i it, Watson;
but unless some lucky chance comes
: our . way ; I fear that the â¢ Norwood f Dis
appearance Case will not figure in that â 
chronicle -'of our successes ; which I
foresee that a patient publlo will
sooner or later have to endure."
"Surely," said I, "the man's disap
pearance would go far with the Jury?"
"That Is a dangerous argument, my
dear Watson. You remember that
terrible murderer, Bert Stevens, who
wanted us to get him off in '87? Was
there ever a more mildmannered
Sunday school young man?"
"It's true.'"
"Unless we eucceed in establishing
an alternative theory, that man la
lost. You can hardly find a flaw in
the case which can now be presented
against him, and all further investiga
tion has served to strengthen it. By
the way, there is one curious little
point about those papers which may
- Â°usas #â  for an in
quiry. On looking over the bank book
I found that the low state of the bal
ance was principally due to large
checks which have been made out
during the last year to Mr. Cornelius.
I confess that I should be Interested
to know who this Mr. Cornelius
may be with whom a retired builder
has such very large transactions. Is
it possible that he has had a hand in
the affair? Cornelius might be a bro
ker, but we have found no scrip to
correspond with these large payments.
Failing any other indication, my re
searches must now take the direction
of an inquiry at the bank for the gen
tleman who has cashed these checks.
But I fear my dear fellow, that our
case will end ingloriously by Lestrade
hanging our client, which will certain
ly be a triumph for Scotland Yard."
I do not know how far Sherlock
Holmes took any sleep that night, but
when I came down to breakfast I
found him pale and harassed,* his
bright eyes the brighter for the dark
shadows round them. The carpet
round his chair was littered with cig
arette-ends and with the early editions
of the morning papers. An open tele
gram lay on the table.
"What do you think of this, Wat
ton?'" he asked, tossing it across.
It was from Norwood, and ran as fol
lows:
"Important fresh evidence to hand.
McFarlane's guilt definitely estab
lished. Advise you to abandon case.
âLestrade."
"This sounds serious," said I.
"It is Lestrade's little cock-a-doodle
of victory," Holmes answered, with a
bitter smile. "And yet It may be pre
mature to abandon the case. After
all, Important fresh evidence is a two
edged thing, and may possibly cut in
a very different direction to that which
Lestrade imagines. Take your break
fast, Watson, and we will go together
and see what we can do. I feel as if
I shall need your company and your
moral support to-day."
My friend had no breakfast himself,
for it was one of his peculiarities that
in his more Intense moments he would
permit himself no food, and I have
known him presume upon his iron
strength until h^ has fainted from pure
inanition. "At present I cannot spare
energy and nerve force for digestion,"
he would say In answer to my medical
remonstrances. I was not surprised,
therefore, when this morning he left
his untouched meal behind him, and
started with me for Norwood. A
crowd of morbid sightseers were still
gathered round Deep Dene House,
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CAU2.
which was Just such a suburban villa
as I had pictured. Within the Kates
Lestrade met us, his face flushed with
victory, his manner grossly triumph
ant.
"Well, Mr. Holmes, have you proved
us to be wrong yet? Have you found
your tramp?" he cried.
"I have formed no conclusion what
ever," my companion answered.
"But we formed ours yesterday, and
now it proves to be correct, so you
must acknowledge that we have been
a little in front of you this time, Mr.
Holmes."
"You certainly have the air of some
thing unusual having occurred," said
Holmes.
Lestrade laughed loudly.
"You don't like being beaten any
more than the rest of us do," said he.
"A man can't expect always to have it
his own way, can he, Dr. Watson?
Step this way, If you please, gentls-
men, and I think I can convince you
once for all that it was John McFar
lane who did this crime."
He led us through the passage and
out into a dark hall beyond.
"This is where young McFarlane
must have come out to get his hat af
ter the crime was done," said he.
"Now look at this." With dramatic
suddenness he struck a match, and by
its light exposed a stain of blood
upon the whitewashed wall.
As he held the match nearer, I saw
that it was more than a stain. It was
the well-marked print of a thumb.
"Look at 'that with your magnifying
glass, Mr. Holmes."
"Yes, I am doing so."
"You are aware that no two thumb
marks are alike?"
"I have heard something of the
kind." .
"Well, then, will you please com
pare that print with this wax impres
sion of young McFarlane's right
thumb, taken by my orders this morn
ing?"
As he held the waxen print close to
the blood-stain, it did not take a
magnifying glass to see that the two
were undoubtedly from the same
thumb. It was evident to me that our
unfortunate client was lost.
"That is final," said Lestrade.
"Yes, that is final," I involuntarily
echoed.
"It is final," said Holmes.
Something In his tone caught my ear,
and I turned to look at him. ex
traordinary change had come over his
face. It was writhing with inward
merriment. His eyes were shin
ing like stars. It seemed to me that
he was making desperate efforts to
restrain a convulsive attack of laugh
ter.
"Dear me! Dear me!" he said at last.
"Well, now, who would have thought
lt? And how deceptive appearances
may be, to be sure! Such a nice young
man to look at! It is a lesson to us
not to trust our own judgment, is it
not, Lestrade?"
"Yes, some of us are a little too much
inclined to be cocksure, Mr. Holmes,"
6aid Lestrade. The man's insolence
was maddening, but we could not re
sent it.
"What a providerftlal thing that this
young man should press his right
thumb against the wall in taking his
hat from the peg! Such a very natural
action, too, if you come to think of it."
Holmes was outwardly calm, but his
whole body gave a wriggle of sup
pressed excitement as he spoke. "By
the way. Lestrade, who made this re
markable discovery?"
"It was the housekeeper, Mrs. Lex
ington, who drew the night constable's
attention to it."
"Where waa the night constable?"
"He remained on guard in the bed
room where the crime was committed,
so as to see that nothing was touched."
"But why didn't the police see this
mark yesterday?"
"Well, we had no particular reason
to make a careful examination of the
hall. Besides, it's not in a very prom
inent place, as you see."
"No, no â of course not. I suppose
there is no doubt that the mark was
there yesterday?"
Lestrade looked at Â«slormes . as if he
thought he was gold Â»arut of his mind.
I confess that I wa M myself surprised
both at his hilariocs fcnanner and at
his rather wild observation.
"I don't know whathar you think that
McFarlane came oat of gaol in the
dead of the night in order to strengthen
the evidence against himself," said
Lestrade. "I leave it to any expert in
the world whether that is not the
mark of his thumb."
"It is unquestionably the mark of his
thumb."
"There, that's enough," said Les
trade. "I am a practical man, Mr.
Holmes, and when I have got my evi
dence I come to my conclusions. If you
have anything to say, you will find me
writing my report in the sitting
room."
Holmes had recovered his equani
mity, though I still seemed to detect
gleams of amusement in his expres
sion.
"Dear me. this is a very sad de
velopment, Watson, is it not?" said he.
"And yet there are singular points
about it which hold out some hopes for
our client."
"I am delighted to hear it," said I,
heartily. "I was afraid it was all up
with him."
"I would hardly go so far as to say
that, my dear Watson. The fact is
that there Is one really serious flaw in
this evidence to which our friend at
taches so much importance."
"Indeed. Holmes! What is it?"
"Only this: that I know that that
mark was not there when I examined
the hall ; yesterday. And now. Wat
son, let us have a little stroll round in
', the sunshine." ;: ;'^ . ' ". /_,;Â»,"..
- With a confused brain, but with a
heart â  into which some warmth of hope
was returning, I - accompanied my
friend 'in a - walk round the. garden.
Holmes took each faxe of the house
:in turn, and examined -lt^ with great
interest He then led the way inside. .
and went over the whole building : trom

to be solid wall at the end of the cor

out of it, like a rabbit out of its bur

"Capital!" said Holmes, calmly.
"Watson, a bucket of water over the
straw. That will do! Lestrade, allow
me to present you with your principal
missing witness, Mr. Jonas Oldacre."
The detective stared at the newcom
er with blank amazement. The latter
was blinking in the bright light of the
corridor, and peering at us and at the
smoldering fire. It was an odious
faceâ crafty, vicious, malignant, with
shifty, light-gray eyes and white
lashes.
"What's this, then?" said Lestrade,
at last. "What have you been doing
all this time, eh?"
Oldacre gave an uneasy laugh,
shrinking back from the furious red
face of the angry detective.
"I have done no harm."
"No harm? You have done your best

A lath-and-plaster â¢: partition had

slits under the eaves. ; A few articles

"There's the advantage of being a
milder.". said Holmes, as we came out.
'He .was able to fix up his own little
lldlng place without any confederateâ
lave, , of, course, that precious >^ house
teeper of his, whom I should lose no
ime in adding â to your bag. Lestrade."
"I'll take your advice. - But how- did

"I made up my mind that the fellow

"The i thumb-mark, Lestrade. You

[ "Very simply. When ' those packets

-i â¢ "Wonderful!" " Lestrade. "Won
derful! It's all 'as clear as crystal.' as
you put it. But what Is the object of
this deep deception, Mr. Holmes?"
It was amusing to see how the de
tective's overbearing manner had
changed suddenly to that -of a child
asking questions of Its' teacher.
"Well, I don't think that is very
hard to explain. A very deep, ma
licious, vindictive person is the gen
tleman who is now waiting us down
stairs. You know that he was once
refused by McFar lane's ' mother You
don't! I ; told you that you should
go to Blackheath first and Norwood
afterward. Well, this injury, as he
would â¢ consider it, has rankled in his
wicked, ; scheming brain, and all his
life he has longed for vengeance, but
never seen his chance. During the last
year or two, things have gone against
â secret speculation, I think â and
he finds himself in a bad way. He de

"I think soâ more and more. A good

fan against her lips. Something
stabbed through her.
"A clever woman could give you all
thatâ and more," she said, after a mo
ment.
"No; she might think she could. in
the first enthusiasm of love. But she 1
â would not, for the reason that she
would exact as much in return; and a
man has so little time."
"And is that your idea of happi

would be hard to find a better. There
are plenty of clever and attractive wo
men a man can always meet."
"That is not what I asked you. You
answered for the race, not for your

will not be frank with me how are we

"Why did you ask her to marry youâ

There Is not the same excuse for you

Four years ago I had thought less.
And propinquity is a strong factor."
"What shall you do when you meet
the one woman?"
."I don't know. No man knows be
forehand what he will do in any cir
cumstance. Perhaps I should behave
like a scoundrel and cut. Perhaps I
should find strength somewhere." .
"What is the use of strength? What
do all those ideals amount to, anyhow?

higher. I hardly know what. And I
have always asked â To what end? Cvi

Good-night."
CHAPTER XII.
Ho did not see her alone again for
two days, although he was with her
constantly, and they had long talks
apart. There were seven clever men
Â»t Casa Norte this time; all of the wo
nen were bright, or more, and the
flays and nights were very gay. They
rode and drove and sailed and pic
nicked, and sang and played tennis
and told stories, and there was much
good conversation. Clive wrote a brief
note daily to Mary Gordon, but gave
up his thoughts recklessly to Helena
Bel mo.-! t. She showed to full advan-
tage as hostess; thoughtful, suggest*
ive, womanly, unselfish. Her mind, as
revealed in their long conversations,
captivated him. Her grace appealed
more keenly to his senses than her
beauty, which sometimes, as she talk
ed, wholly disappeared, broken by a
personality so strong and so variable
as to play havoc with its harmonies.
On the third morning he met her in
the pink-and-green wilderness of the
rose garden. The dew glittered on
every leaf and petal, for the sun was
hardly over the mountain. The guests
had been ordered early to bed the
night before, that they might rise early
and go on a picnic in a distant part of
the forest. Rollins was buttoning his
shirt befoTe an open window and sing-
Ing a duet with Mrs. Tower, who had
her head out of another window. Hel
ena wore a pink-and-whlte organdie
frock and a large hat lined with pink.
She was gathering a cluster of roses
for her belt. As Clive Joined her she
plucked a bud and pinned it on his che
viot shirt; he wore no coat; the men
only dressed for dinner.
Cllve's broad shoulders were between
the house and Helena. He pressed his
hand suddenly over hers, flattening the
bud.
"You've stuck me," she said, pout
ing. "These roses are full of thorns."
"I think I'd better go."
She gave him a glance of mingled
alarm, anger and appeal.
"You will not go!"
She turned her hand about and
clasped it over his.
"What is the use? I'm afraid I'm
getting In too deep. What common
sense I have left tells me to get out
while there is time."
She tightened her clasp. "But you
won't go?" she said imperiously.
"No, I shall not pw If I did, I
shouldn't stay."
Helena threw back her head, her wo
man's keen delight in power over man
as strong for the moment as her glad-
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
ness in Clive's touch and presence.
After breakfast Miss Belmont and
her guests drove for two hours through
the forest, scarcely seeing the sun,
then camped in a canyon by a running
stream. The canyon was narrow at
the bottom, but widened above, and
seemed to have gathered all the sun
shine of the day. Its sides were a tan
gle of fragrant chaparral, wild roses,
purple lilac and red lily, the delicate
green of yrmngr trees, the metallic
green and red of the madrono. On high
were the stark redwoods.
Some of the men went frankly to
sleep after luncheon. The others and
several of the girls fished ardently.
"Come," said Helena to Clive. "There
is a trail over there, and I want to see
what is on top."
"It will be a hard pull."
They pushed in among the fronds,
which grew taller as they penetrated.
Soon Clive had no need to hold the
leaves apart for his companion; they
spread out a foot or more above their
heads. The place, a young forest of
slender columns, was filled with green
light. Small feathery ferns nodded in
a little breeze. The creek seemed to
murmur above them. Clive turned and
looked at Helena. Her face was glori
fied. He took her in his arms and
kissed her. She did not shrink from
him, and they clung together.
After a few moments she moved her
head back and looked up at him. His
eyes were not laughing.
"There is something I want to say,"
she said. "A woman doesn't usually
say it until she Is asked. I love you. I
want you to know that I couldn't kiss
you like that if I did not."
"I believe that you love me," he said.
"Did you guess the reason I did not
kiss you the other night? I had intend
ed to, but it suddenly came to me that
you did not love me enough, that you
were merely In love with me; and I
could not give myself like that. I In
tended to wait longer than this. But I
forgot." She hesitated a momentâ the
color left her face. "Do you love me?"
she asked.
"Yes," he said, "I love you."
She went back to his arms, but even
while she learned the lesson that some
women learn once only, and then pos
sessingly and finally, she realized that
she had not the courage to speak of
Mary Gordon. She had intended, the
moment she was cure of him, to com
mand him to break his engagement
at once; but her arrogant will found
itself supple before the strong fiber of
the man, and shrank from the encoun
ter. They walked on after a time, un
til they came to a stone, where they
sat down. She put her hands about
his face. The motion was a little awk
ward, but she was a woman who
would grow very lavish with caresses.
"Why do you look so serious?" she
asked. "You looked so different a mo
ment ago."
"The situation Is serious," he said
hriefiy. "But don't let us talk about
it: we have twelve more days."
She threw her head back against his
shoulder and looked up into the feath
ery roof. A ray of light wandered In
and touched her face. "I am so hap
py," she said, "I don't care what to
morrow brings. I have thought and
thought of being with you like this and
now I am and it is enou^n. I ought to
be seriousâ l know what you are
thinking ofâ but it doesn't matter;
nothing but this matters. I never took
life seriously â except in a sort of ab
stract mental way occasionallyâ until
a week ago, and I doubt if I could
keep it up."
"You could keep it up. You don't
know yourself."
"Once I got dreadfully bored and
took care of a sick poor woman who
lived in a. cabin near a place where I
was staying. Her husband was away
in the mines, and she had no one to
look after her but neighbors as poor as
herself. I sat up with her and worked
over her as if she were my sister. I
was frightfuly Interested, and so proud
of myself. Then one morningâ l think
it was the fifthâ l was sitting by the
window about four o'clock, looking at
the view, which was beautiful â a roll
ing country covered with closely trim
med grapevines, and miles and miles
beyond, a range of the blue mountains.
It was so quiet. Eternity must be like
that quiet of four in the morning. And
gradually as I looked the most sick
ening: disgust crept over me for the life
I hid 'ed the past fc-ur days, an utter
collapsing of my philanthropy. I want
ed to go away and be frivolous. I was
hideously bored. I hated the sick wo
man, her poverty and everything se
rious in lire. I stole away and sent
back a servant to stop until I could
get a trained nurse. I never went
near the woman again."

ATHERTON
He pressed her to him with passion
ate sympathy. "Poor child," he said,
"you have lived only in the shallows.
I wish you always might."
But she was too happy to heed any
thing but the strength of his embrace.
"You don't know yourself, ' he said,
"not the least little bit."
"I know a lot more than you think,
and I know how I can love you."
"Yon hardly know that. You have
merely a vague far-away notion. All
your woman's lore is borrowed, and
you are only half awake. Your mind,
your mental conception of things, has
outrun everything else. If the other
part ever caught up up you would be
a wonderful woman." Something in
his tone made her take her will be
tween her teeth.
"You will teach me," she said impe
riously, "as long as we are both alive."
"Yes, if I am a scoundrel. But don't
let us talk about that now, please. I
will be happy, too. Come, let us get
out of this. It is damp and we will
get rheumatism, whicn is not roman
tic. Let us co home and sit in your
boudoir. I feel r.s if I sh'.-uld like to
be surrounded by the conventiDiialiti^s
o' life for a time. One feels coo primi
tive in this forest."
r CHAPTER XIII.
The next morning she awoke with a
sudden pang of sympathy for Mary
Gordon. Her intuitions were keener
than they had ever been. She turned
â  restlessly, then sprang out of bed and
rang for her maid.
She .went out into the garden and
gathered a basket of roses for the
breakfast table. ; As she entered the
court, the dew on her hair, her 'damp
frock clinging to her bust and arms,
Clive was standing : by the " fountain,
and alone. 1 His eyes had been dull, but
the light â  sprang â  to â¢ them '-. as he went
forward to meet her. He half held out
his arms. She dropped the basket into
them with a little -. laugh.
. "Come into the * dining-room," she
said, "and help :me arrange them."
. â¢ The water was i ready in the silver
and crystal bowls. She disposed the
roses with a few practiced touches,
then, turned and flung her arms about
Clive and kissed * him. ,
. ; "What is the " matter?" she asked.
"Didn't you sleep?"
"No; not much."
â¢ "You said you would not think. Not
' fo7 i twelve days."
"I "t&all^try not to."
, "V- â  must sleep "after breakfast. I'll

Helena made no secret of her love for
Clive. "â¢ Even if i she had been less sure
of success, she would have gloried in
doing him honor. But, although. she
did not doubt the issue, she had
respect enough for him to scent a bat
tle ahead," and the savage In her was
ardent for the fight. ~ .
The : household was profoundly inter
ested. Helena, despite: - her love ".of
power, had never been known : before ;
to deliberately woo a man from an
other woman. They knew that she
must be mastered; by a pasion new to
her, .to 'ignore a girl whom she liked
and respected as she did Mary Gordon.
Even ; the women â¢ believed she would
win; only Rollins doubted. .
"I don't know," he said to Mrs. Lent;
; "he's broad-gauge, . that man. He's iso
infatuated : now that he doesn't know
where hog at. ' But he'll wake up. and

"Well, I wish he'd hurry and make
up his mind," said Mrs. Lent, "for he
looks like a funeral. He flirted with
even poor little me when he first came,
but I haven't seen that delightfully
wicked expression in his eyes for a
week."
CHAPTER XIV.
Chve would not sit up all night with
Helena, but they spent hours of the
day in the forest, and there was noth
ing funereal in his aspect when they
were alone. One morning: Helena a
maid brought her a note when Jw
came to awaken her.
â¢My Dear Miss Belmuv*.
"I am going away for a fe

Helena stared at the abrupt, formal
missive in dismay for a momÂ«n'
laughed. She had seen men stru* ;
her net before. She knew tha
would keep his word and returc, â.d
had perfect faith in the power of her
seductive charm, no matter what good
resolve he might accomplish when
away.
It was a hot day, and her guests
were too indolent to do anything but
lie about and smoke and read. They
did not want to be entertained, and she
let them alone and ST>ent the day In
the rose garden in the shade of the
oaks. She rather enjoyed thinking of
Clive, for variety, and anticipating his
return. She concocted clever argu
ments! and convincing apneals
The next day she sat on a ledge be
low the crest of the cliffs and stared at
the huge restless waves of the Pacific
rearing uprainst the outlying rocks,
falling with their baffled roar. There
was neither peace, nor reason, nor
power of anticipation in her. She was
insensible oT any instinct beyond an
insufferable desire for his physical
presence.
That night she went to bed glad with
the thought that she should see him in
sixteen hours, and pictured their meet
ing so often and variously, and struck
a match to look at the clock so many
times, that she slept little. The next
morning she was so nervous and ap
prehensive that the placid conversation
of her guests was intolerable and she
would not drive with them. After
luncheon she went up to a favorite
spot in the forest, directing cmc of the
Ckteni servants to conduct Clive to
her when he returned.
As the afternoon wore on her gloom
! i f t^ 1 1 and passed. She grew light
minded and humorous, almost indiffer
ent. She took herself to task in some
dismay; in the titnesa of things sha
should be passionately seru.-us when he
arrived. "Are there really no great
crises in life?" she thought. "Are we
ali comedians gone wrong, personified
1 But she was helpless; the re
action was inevitable.
Cttre was late. He was always lats.
Helena felt no uneasiness, but sat idly,
wonilerinsr how they would meet, her
mind occc-sionaly drifting to other
things. She bad carried a large hat
lined with white and covered with
white plumes, in a box through the
damaging brush, and hidden the box
in a hollow redwood. The hat, pushed
backward on hÂ«r brilliant hair, en
hanced the oval colori,-us beauty of her
face. She took it off suddenly and
threw it on the ground; the attempt
was too evident; all men were not con
sistently dense.
She heard a crackling in the brush on
the other side of the creek, then the
Chinaman's pro-testing voice.
"Can't hully when catchee pigtail
allee time, Mister Clive. Me got thlee
velly bad selafhes, and clothes allee
same no washee."
There was no answer from Clive, but
he was in view presently. The China
man retreated hastily, wrapping his
pigtail round hi? neck. Helena rose
and went forward.
She felt suddenly resentful and
haughty.
After all, it was presumption In a
man to take upon himself the deciding
of a question which was as vital to her
as to him. She wc-ndered If she really
did love him; certainly sne felt neither
tenderness nor tolerance at the mo
ment.
Clive walked slowly across the felled
redwood which served as bridge be
tween the high banks of the creek. As
he approached Helena forgot herself
arM her moods.
"He ha 3 suffered horribly,** she
thousrht. "What am I to do that I did
not know he must?"
And then she realized that she couldtot comprehend his experience of the
last three days; that her mind merely
grasped the fact; she had profounder,
more sympathetic understanding. She
. drew back, frightened and chilled.
"I am eorry. to see you looking bo
badly." she said coldly, as they shook
hands. "Perhaps we had better > have
it out at once."
They sat down against two redwoods,
lacing each other.
"Very well." said Clive. "I have been
a scoundrel and nothing I can say is
the least excuse. I can caly state the
facts. â¢ â¢ â¢ The average girl who
is an avowed flirt expects to be made
love to, and a man finds it no task to
do what a charming woman exacts of
him. â¢ â¢ * I took you in the be
ginning for a spoiled beauty, a co
quette, above the average as far as
brain was concerned, but still suggest
ling little more than an unusually spir
ited â¢ flirtation. Of course, I was fa
more fascinated than 1 realized, or X
should not have come to your house,
r.c-r should I have asked you to give
me these two weeks. * â¢ â¢ That *
it might mean life or death to either of
us I 'lid not realize until that day
among the ferns."
The fight was on. Helena threw back
her head. "Can you not explain to
Mary Gordon? Surely sue would re
lease you." *'
"I never could explain to Mary Gor
don, â jt .Â«rfd comprehend that after ;
fo^J yiris I had thrown 1 her over for
a/prec tier woman whom I had known
Awo veeks. Women like simple,
good, loyal women â don't reason and
analyze as a clever woman does. And
the hurt lastsâ not' because the man is
worth it, any more than any man is
good enough for such womenâ but be
cause they are what they are."
"But she was not the woman for
you; therefore she would find another
man."
. "She would live on an isolated ranch
in Southern California for several
years, then go back to England and
live in her old home, among the people
she has known all her life. Those wo
men dAiit seek distraction. They are
the slaves of an idea. If the right
mar did come, she wouldn't know it."
"All of which means that you think
it your duty to marry her."
"I mean to marry her. There is
nothing else to be done. If there were
no other reason I have no right Â»to
make her ridiculous."
Helena caught her breath. For the
first time she mentally appreciated the
strength in the man which had capti
vated her woman's instincts. But she
did not lose courage.
"And 1 am not to be considered at
all? I say nothing about being made
ridiculous. If I am it is my own fault,
and I don't care, anyhow; that seems
to me a very insignificant matter. Now
that I have found you am I to be left
â thirty, forty years? You know
that I have about equal possibilities of
good and bad in me. If I married you
1 could become as wholly good as any
mortal can. I never realized what pos
sibilities there are in any of us as I did
in the last few days before you went
away. The principal reason that I
love you is because I always feel that
there is something. In you to climb to
and that you could lift me up to you.
If you leave me I'll become a bad wo
man. Why not? It must be very in
teresting, and I have nothing more in
life to look forward to. If I lived with
you I might grow into your belief; you
could carry me anywhere; but alone 1
cannot. Moreover, I want to live in
this life. I cannot sit down and wait
patiently for a mythical and unsub
stantial hereafter. I am too much of a
eavage, I suppose, but at all events, I
can't."
"There will be no excuse for you to
becc-me a bad woman. You haye t too
much brain and money â too many
methods of distraction. You can travel
and make any life you choose. ) The
world is an interesting place; you don't
know the A B C of it"
"You are cruel."
"Yes," he said. "More so than you
realize just now."
I'm not doubting that you love me.
If I did, do you suppose I would argue
with you? I'm not in a tender or sym
pathetic mood. There is too much to
be said. I must talk It out now; we
are not an ordinary pair or fools." She
paused a moment and looked straight
at him. "We have a more imperative
duty to ourselves than to traditions.
You are in a new world now,, almost in
a new civilization. Smash such out
worn ideals. They are nothing, noth
ing to human happiness." , .
"Such traditions as honor and faith
and pity for the weaker are in the bone
and blood of the older civilization. If
we tore them out there is not much
we've got, that's worth anything, that i
wouldn't follow."
"I would not care â a straw. I .
should love you whether you were sat
isfied with yourself or not, and I could
make you forget.
"No; you could not."
"Oh, you are away above me." she
â¢aid bitterly. "I don't mean to say
that I haven't known. plenty of honor-*
able men, but they would find a way
out of itâ for me. You seem to be
welded together so compactly that
every characteristic Is bound up with
every other. Nothing is acquired, sep
arate. Probably I'd never reach you
after all. Perhaps it Is as well we
don't - marryâ -"
"I wish you would not talk as if I
were an infernal prig. Can't you im
agine what an ass a man feels when a
woman rots to him like that? I am the
most ordinary person you will probably
â¢ver know. If I were not we wouldn't
be where wÂ« are to-day. Now that I
have mads such a mess of things I can
only see one way out of It, and I don't
feel a hero, I assure you."
"Have you thought of yourself at all
during the last three days?"
"OX course I've thought of myself.
What a question: And thinking of my
self meant thinking of you."
"But you have thought more of Mary
Gordon â I mean you have considered
her more."
"Yes; I have."
She got up and went over and > sat
down on the edge of the bluff. He i
filled his pipe. She smiled as the smoke
drifted to her. She thought that she
had never seen the creek look so beau- i
tiful. The stones under the clear wa- â¢
ter shone like opaque Jewels. Great
bunches of feathery maidenhair clung i
to every boulder. The long, delicate ,
etrands of the Ice grass trailed far !
over the water. Tiny trees sprouted
from rocks In mid-stream, where moss
had gathered. Red lilies and ferns
grew close to the brink. The ugly
brown roots of a pine clung, squirming, i
down the bluff.
On the mountain above the plateau a i
deer leaped once, crashing through the
brush, tossing his white horns In terror '<
at sight of man. A squirrel chattered
high up in a redwood, wnere he was
packing acorns for the winter. A :
Fchool of salmon swam serenely down
the creek and disappeared in the dark
perspective. ,
Helena sat there for a half-hour.
Then she went back to Clive, but did i
not eit down. He rose also. '
"I understand you a, little better, I
think." she said. "You won't like what i
I am going to say, but I shall say it, i
anyhow. You have so much good in :
you. I never thought I should love a I
good man, but I believe that is really
the reason I love you so much. The
raw material in me responds to the
highly developed in you. You are ca- ;
pable of so much that is way beyond
roe. I have fine impulses, but they ere
shallow; lofty ideals, but in a little I
while they bore me. And you are con- <
sistent. Even when you do what you !
know to be wrong, you never vary in
your ideals and faith. ' I am new and i
crude and heterogeneous. It A is the
difference between thÂ« Old and the i
tS*xr, m .
"You have the richest possibilities of
any woman I have ever known "
"Tell me something. Ie it not be
cause Mary Gordon is tne more help
less and appeals more to your chival
ry? â although you love me more; al
though I have more beauty and brains
and passion, and could make you fur
happier?"
"That is one reason."
"Then will the manliest and best of
men continue to be captured by the
best and simplest of women? It will
produce a better race, I suppose. If I
had been your mother you would not
be half what you are. It is enough *or
the man to have the brain, I suppose.
We are a forced growth and a*;normal
â but what is to become of us**
His reserve left him then/.nd he
caught her in his arms. She *lung to
him desperately, and for a whife for
got that the victory was still to oe
won. Then she cried and coaxal and
pleaded, and lavished endearment, and
was far more difficult for the man to
combat than when he had stood his
ground with a brain alone.
"Come," he said finally; "can't you
understand? You might help me a lit
tle. Can't you see that I want to let
everything go and stay with you?
Don't you think I know what I should
find with you? You do know that?
Well, then, you should also know that
I have made up my mind to do the
only decent thing a man could do."
"Well, give me a month longer. Let
me have that much, at least."
"I shall go to-morrow. If I go now
all these people will quickly forget me,
and regard what has passed as one of
your flirtations. But if I stayed on I
should make you ridiculous, and per
haps compromise you â you are so
reckless. And for other reasons the
sooner I get away from here the bet
ter."
"What are the other reasons?"
"We've discussed the subject enough.
Come, let us go."
"I never knew that a man cculd be
so obstinate with a beautiful woman
he loved."
"You have a woman's general knowl
edge of men, but you know nothing of
any type of man you haven't encoun
tered. I believe you could make any
man love you; but certain men are
greater cowards before certain Inherit
ed principles than they are before the
prospect of parting from the woman
they most love "
"I said that you were the victim of
traditions."
"Perhaps I am, but I am also unable
to eat raw fish or human flesh. What
are any of us but the logical results of
traditions? Just look at this fog. Let
me put your shawl round you."
Helena turned. A fine white mist
was pouring out of the forest on the
other side olf the creek. It had passed
them, and was puffing slowly onward.
It lay softly on the creek, covering the
bright water. It swirled about the
trees and moved lightly through the
dark arbors above. It fled up the
mountain beyond, and the forest show
ed through the silver veil like gray
columns with capitals and bases of
frozen spray.
"Yes, we must go," said Helena, "or
we shall be lost."
CHAPTER XV.
Helena did not meet her guests at
dinner that night, nor did she trouble
to send word that she was ill. She rang
for the Chinese butler, gave him an or
der, then locked her doors and sat mo
tionless in her boudoir for hours. She
pictured, until her brain ached and her
ears rang, what her lire with Clive
could have been, and what his would
be with Mary Gordon.
But despair was not in her as yet,
for he was still under the same roof,
and she had not played her last card.
It was a card that she had half-con
tciously considered from the begin
ning, and during the last few days had
looked full upon. To-night for the first
time she realized that it was a hateful
card, unworthy of her, but reminded
herself that she was a woman who
would, if necessary, walk straight to
her purpose over cracking and spout
ing earth.
At twelve o'clock she sat before her
dressing table regarding herself atten
tively in a mirror. She wore a negligee
of white crepe and lace, which half re
vealed her neck and bust. Her un
bound hair clung to her body like melt
ed copper, which had just begun to
stiffen into rings and waves and spi
rals. She had never looked more beau
tiful.
There was a knock at her door.
"Wbat is it?" she asked.
"Allee gentleman* go to bled," an
nounced Ah Sing cautiously.
"Very well."
She rose hurriedly, almost overturn
ing her cair. Her hands shook. She
caught sight of a terrified face in the
mirror.
"This won't do!" she thought an
grily. She rang. Ah. Sing returned.
"Brtng me a glass of champagne."
she said.
"Allight"
She closed the door upon him, then
opened it quickly. "Ah Sing!" she
â¦.ailed.
The Chinaman returned.
"Light a lamp in the drawing-room
and ask Mr. Clive to go there."
"Allight"
She stood leaning against the door,
her hand pressed hard against her
chin, her eyes staring angrily at her
reflection in a long Psyche mirror.
Ah Sing tapped and handed in the
champagne. She pushed It aside with
gesture of disgust.
"Take it away. Did you do as I told
you?"
"Yes, missee, Mr. Clive tn dlawlng
loom now."
He went out and still Helena stared
at herself in the mirror with angry ter
rified eyes. After all, she' was but a
sirl, with a woman's theories. What
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
she was determined up^on had seemed
very easy and picturesque at long
range. She had even rehearsed it men
tally during the past two days; but
now that she was to enact the role it
appalled her. She recalled several
scenes of the sort as presented by the
makers of fiction (the canny and Im
aginative Frenchman for the most
part), but failed to find spiritual sta
mina in the retrospect.
"What a fool! What a fool!" she
thought. "I, who have prided myself
that I have a will of iron. If his first
duty is to me he will stay, and two
people will be happy Instead of miser
able. As for Mary Gordon, she will
marry the curate inside of five years."
She retreated suddenly to her ward
robe and wrapped a broad scarf about
her shoulders and bust, then brought
her foot down and went resolutely out
into the corridor.
The fog was banked In the court
The palms looked like the dissolving
eldola of themselves. The invisible
fountain splashed heavily, as if op
pressed.
"I needed the shawl after all," she
thought grimly. "A sneeze might be
fatal."
She walked rapidly down the corridor
to the drawing-room, and without giv
ing herself an instant for vacillation
turned the knob and went in. Then
she cowered against the door and
â would have exchanged every hope she
possessed for the privilege of retreat.
But Clive had seen her.
He was standing by the mantel. He
looked hla best, as he ai;vays did in
evening dress. Even as Helena won
dered if the earth wera shaking be
neath Casa Norte, she was conscious
of his remarkable physical beauty. He
had his pipe in his hand. It dropped
suddenly to the mantel shelf. But he
did not go forward to meet her.
"There is something I want to say,"
she gasped, searching wildly for inspi
ration. "It has occurred to me that
perhaps the reason you hesitated was
my money. I will give it all away â to
charity or my aunt. I will only keep
a little, so as not to be a burden to
you. You may think this a silly Qui
xotic idea â made on the impulse of the
moment â but indeed I would."
"I am sure that you would. I had
not thought of the money. I did not
get that far."
Helena pressed her hands against
the door behind her. She felt an im
pulse to laugh hysterically. For the
life of her she cotild not remember a
detail that she had rehearsed. She felt
as if on the edge of a farce-comedy.
But she would nof. give up the game.
"I am so tired," she said, plaintively.
'I have eaten nothing since I saw you.
lr.d I have thought and thought and
thought until I am all worn out."
He placed a chair at once.
"You poor little thing," he said. "Let
me go to the larder and see if I can't
find you something "
"No; I don't want anything."
She sat down, holding the shawl
closely about her. Clive returned to
the mantel.
"My head ached so I had to take my
hair down," she said.
"I wonder what is going on in your
head at the present moment."
"Don't you know?'
"No. Why are you such a reckless
child? You could have seen me in the
morning."
"I came here to make It impossible
for you to marry Mary Gordon. I can't
do It, and I feel like a fool."
He turned away his head*
"I told you that the ro-le of Delilah
did not suit you. And if it did. couldn't
you see that I had marie up my mind?
What sort of a weakling "
"You didn't let me finish," she inter
rupted him. blushing furiously,
meantâ of course I meantâ that I want
you to leave with me for Europe to
morrowâwe can marry in San Fran

than we do?â Oh, what an idiot I am.
anyhow!"
"Go back to your room â please do.'
"You won't marry me to-morrow,
then?â good heavens! that I should
propose to a man:"
HÂ© made no reply.
"I don't believe you love me a bit."
"Of course you don't. A woman
never gives a man credit for any de
cency of motive: her theory is that he
follows along the line of least resist
ance. Well, I suppose he does."
She dropped her face into her hands.
"Oil, what shall I do? What shall I
do?" ahe said passionately.
Clive brought his hand close above
his own eyes. "Will it not help you
to know that I love you unalterably?'
that?'? a maD remerriber a woman like
"There Is one woman in every man's
life that he never forgets; and â  that
woman, worse luck. Is rarely his wife "
"It would mean everything to me.
And I could be true to you. But it
doesn't satisfy me." She dropped her
hands and stared at him. "I want you
âyou. How am I to drag out my life?
I can't believe that after to-night I
shall never see you again. I can't:
I can't.'" She stood up and leaned
against the opposite end of the mantel.
"Do you know one thing mat keeps on
hurting me through everything?" she
asked after a few moments. "It is
that you suffer more than I do. than
I am capable of suffering, and that
I cannot sympathize with you as I
want to do. la that the reason that
you don't love me well enough to give
up everything else for me â that I am
not strong enough to hold you?"
"Of course it is not the reason. If
you really love me â and I believe you
do â you will suffer enough before you
get through."
For a while neither spoke agai:
moved. The ocean sounded as
were under th? window.
"There is another thing," she said,
finally. 'I may as well say it. I know
that if I had succeeded to-night T
sliould have been horribly disappointed
in you. It wouldn't be you any longer
I or what I love in you is. your strength
â a strength I don't possess. I'm glad
I came to-night, although I've made
myself ridicuk-us: I know both you
and myself better. I can be true to
you now; I don't think I could have
been before, and I might have done
reckless things. And perhaps after
you have gone and the novelty and
excitement have worn off, I shall
understand you still better. That 3
what I shall live for. Promise me that
you will believe that and that spirit
ually I shall never be far from you,
and that I am growing better Instead
of worse."
"1 don't need to promise." His left
hand was still above his eyes. Helena
saw hia right clench. She went toward
the door.
He went forward to open It for her
As ho reached out hl3 hand for the
knob she struck it down and flung h-r
arms about him.
"I can't go iike this," she said pas
sionately. "You must kiss me once
more."
He caught her to him. She saw hiÂ»
eyes blaze as he bei:t his head. a:ul
thought as far as she was capable it
thinking, that her generalities had
been correct. Even in the rapture of
the moment a pang shot through her.
Then ?he found herself on the other
side of the door and heard the key
turn in the locic.
She remembered only that she was
hungry and tired. She went to thn
larder and sat on a box and ate .<
plate of cold chicken and bread, th>.r
went to bed and slept soundly.
CHAPTER XVI.
Next morning the guests of Gftsa
Norte were assembled in the court
discussing. Clive's .departure and wait
ing 'for the traps which would take
them for their accustomed drive, when
Helena, dressed in her habit, came out
of her room and walked up to them.
â , "Mr. . Clive has gone, I suppose?"
she asked.
- "He left a short time ago.** said
Miss Lord. "I am so sorry he will not
return. Helena, how can you be so
cruel?"
. "You are a hypocrite and talking
rubbish. . I tried to get him away from
Mary Gordon and I lost the game and
I v don't care in the least whether you
know it or not. I shall not drive with
you this morning. * I am going for a
ride by myself"; and she left the house.
"Home, heaven and mother:" said
Rollins with a gasp. "I didn't* think
even she 'would . be as game as 'that.
Well, I am â¢ sorryâ sorry.' Damn the
whole business of life, " anyhow.".
. Helena rode rapidly through the for
est, taking a short cut by trail to the
fern grove above the . canyon. She,
came upon it after an hour's hard rid-\
ing. She noted that it was almost' '
circular in form, . irregularly outlined
by the redwoods. The stilt and feather
tops were rustling in a soft breeze and
glinted . with '.; the :' younger .. shades, of
green.'/ She thought that she had never
seen . the sky, so , blue, the sun' so gold en.
The trees .were"; singing high above.
Occasionally. one â¢ branch : creaked upon

She tethered her horse and went In
among, the ferns. . When they .closed
above her head and the green 'twilight
was about her, she felt gratefully that
she was beyond the eye of man. hidden
even from the redwoods, which, she
had a fancy, were human and wise.
â¢ She sat down on the stone and cried.
Tears did not come easily to her; she
was . not a lightly : emotional â¢ woman.
To-day she abandoned herself to a
passion of grief t which thrilled her
nerves and cramped her fingers. It
was a passion which accumulated
depth and strength instead of dissipat
ing itself, and it was an hour before
she was exhausted. . The storm brought
no relief, as April showers- do to most
women. She felt heavy anil blunt, and
knew that the third stage would be
the ' first. She was conscious of one
other thing only: that she understood
Clive better than she had ever done be
fore, and that her sympathy was as
strong for him as for herself.
Suddenly she sprang to her. feet and
faced the point of the fern-wood where
she had made entrance. The 'tears
dried under the rush of blood.
"Owin!" she cried. "Owin."'
She strained her head forward, then â  â¢
drew back slowly. There- was not a
sound in the forest- Her lips fell apart.
"Owin!" she gasped. She shook from.
head to foot. He had a quick," strong
step. She heard it now with . a sub
consciousness of which she had never
been cognizant before. But it made no
sound in her ears. " "".*."
Then she sank back against the
ferns, bending them with her weight,
closing her eyes. The spiritual part
within her seemed to become clearly
defined. Something touched and passed
it. There was a moment of promise,
rather than of ecstasy, then of peace.
: ; She opened her eyes. "Owin," shÂ»
whispered. But she was alone. â¢ "*
She went out of- the ferns and
mounted her horse and rode rapidly
homeward. As she turned . the - corner
of Casa Norte she heard the telephone
bell ring violently. A groom met her
and lifted her from the horse. . She
walked down the garden toward the
door. Her aunt entered the office.
Helena paused outside of the window
to listen to the ridiculous one-sided
conversation of the telephone.

UNFINISHED
NOVEL
CORA
CRESSEY
CROW
This iÂ» ih<> u inning conclusion to
the unfinished l>i.*raeli novel publish
ed in th< Sunday Call, February 12
and 19. It is written by Cora Cressy
<"!â¢<>Â«. who. it will be remembered,
\n;i- the winner of the first prize story
of tliis series. The problem was a dif
ficult one, but this *tory. in literary
finish, strength and plausibility, was
judged by Uie editors as best fulfilling
tlie somewhat difficult conditions pre
sented.
TO attend the salon of the Coun
tess Bertram immediately be
came the fashion. There Kusi
nara elucidated the principles
of the Vedanta philosophy to a
coterie of London's most exclusive set.
And if such words as "yoga" and "Nir
vana," as they went glibly from lip to
lip, seemed the least profaned thereby
to the devout Buddhist ear, he con-
Boled himself by the conviction, buried
deep in his soul, that his religion alone
would revolutionize a world in sad need
of adjustment. In spite of the lack of
spirituality in many of his listeners
the eloquent words did not fall al
together on barren soil. Gaston Ber
tram had long revolted at the regular
order of things. He desired to mitigate
the evils of the world â evils which
â hocked his artistic nature, but his
dreamy idealism lacked force and ex
pressed Itself only in a supercilious
pessimism. Solely at the request of
the enthusiastic Countess Bertram he
attended her salon. Once there his at
tention was immediately arrested and
held by the novelty of Kusinara's
thought, not less than by his forceful
manner of expressing himself. Gas
ton's lack of political ambition and the
indeflnltenessof his life left a void which
his mercurial temperament now filled
with the teachings of the Oriental phi
losophy in which he steeped himself.
Nor to him aJone did the exhortations
of the scholarly Indian appeal. Lady
Ermyntrude had been denied the
needed companionship of a nature that
would act ac a sort of balance wheel
to her erratic impulsiveness. Keenly
gifted in the art of penetrating char
acter, the shams which she encountered
In the social world into which she was
now fully launched only served to ac
centuate the scornful expression of her
face, which, seen before but occasion
ally, had now become habitual. The
novelty of being sought by various suit
ors soon wore off and to her high-strung
nature, bo starved for the wholesome
things of life, a mother's love and
thought and care, the mystic words of
Kuslnara came as a sort of balm, for
In him she felt the sincerity of his

convictions, ft servod. too, as a bond
which drew hsr olosely toward Gaston,
whose magnetic personality and charm
of manner were revived by his intent
ness on mastering the doctrines pro
mulgated by the Buddhist.
"Ermyntrude," he said one evening
after Countess Bertram's guests had
taken leave, "do you come to these lec
tures like the fashionable sheep, who
follow the route of the leader?"
"Indeed I do not, Gaston," she re
plied, stunned by his remark. "You
might cry baa. baa. till doomsday and
I shouldn't follow in your lead, unless
my convictions took me there. I listen
to Kusinara because he carries me
away from myself and from the sham
in which we live. I hate it," she added
with a sudden vehemence.
Gaston looked at her with the com
prehension of a ready sympathy.
"Forgive me, dear Ermyntrude." he
cried, impulsively catching her hand.
The affectionate ring in his voice went
through to her heart.
The high social position of Countess
Bertram, her known inliuence in the
world of fashion, together with her
superficial nature, with its certain
form of intensity, and no legitimate
object on which to vent itself, her
daughter having been consigned to
other hands, made her a desirable ob
ject by which the Unknown might
carry out his theories for mankind. His
unmistakable breeding and the air of
mystery with which he still continued
to envelop himself gave him an added
charm in the eyes of the Countess, who
scarcely realized that she and Kusl
nara, in different ways, were the In
struments of sowing the seeds of a
doctrine of extermination of the hu
man race â seeds destined to take deep
root In virgin soil and bring forth a
harvest of sorrow. She only knew she
was now the center of adulation.
Chatterly wrote long reviews of the
Buddhist and his lectures in which he
spoke of a "new priestess of a divine
philosophy who had brought light into
darkness." Congratulations poured in
upon her. The sudden appearance of
the strange Unknown and his equally
mysterious disappearance save to it
an added zest. Mr. Hartmann, too,
attended the salon. His daughter An
gela accompanied him but a few times.
To her the atmosphere reeked with a
certain unwholesomeness which she
could not explain but felt keenly. The
deep reverence in which she held her
father and her respect for his intel
lectual attainments, coupled with his
philosophy of life, were stumbling
blocks to her peace of mind. It even
became a relief to spend tne day with
the Falconets, whose religious creed,
if narrowed overmuch, was at least
restful and she returned home girded
with a spiritual strength to pray that
her father might yet renounce a phil
osophy the pessimism of which seemed,
to her mind, to fit ill with his cheerful
habits of life.
Joseph Falconet, in the meantime,
had obtained his seat in Parliament
and was full of zeal to use the power
committed to him for the amelioration
of mankind and the maintenance of
the creed of the God of his fathers. A
strained feeling existed Detween him
self, and the Countess Bertramâ for his
firmly balanced mentality could not
condone the vagaries of a mind which
could let Itself be swayed from fhe
creed of the orthodox church, to the
conservation of which he had secretly
dedicated his life. He looked with a
conet's mind and made him realize the
certain distrust Â«po& tfet frtqnanoy of
Angela's visits to nto sisters, being
aware of thÂ» doctrines her father in
culcated. But these misgivings were
unexpectedly dismissed. Tired with tha
earnestness with which he had pleaded
his cause that day in the House he
had walked home to rest his mind in
bodily exercise. His free swinging
stride soon left the town behind him
and as he came to the outer edge of
the suburb, every spot of which was
associated with the various Incidents
of childhood, his steps unconsciously
slackened their pace and the busy
thoughts which were thronging his
brain gradually gave way to a certain
peace, engendered by the time and
place. He passed his hand across his
brow involuntarily and the motion
seemed to banish his habitually stern
expression. As he passed the burying
ground he glanced over it, and for an
instant a grave smile crossed his face.
He recalled the terrors it had had for
him as a boy. As he looked he dis
cerned a slight figure emerging from
the trees which overshadowed it. Sur
prised that any one should be there
at that hour he paused, hardly knowing
he did so. As the figure approached
the outer gate he barely repressed an
expression of surprise.
"Miss Hartmann â you! And at this
hour!"
Recovering from the momentary em
barrassment which his unexuected
presence caused her, she replied:
"Yes, Mr. Falconet. You are sur
prised I know to find me alone and
here at this hour. But there are cer
tain moods which will not admit of
the presence of another person. At
such times I find The City of the Dead
alone gives the needed peace."
A year apo such sentiments from a
young girl would have shocked the con
servative instincts of Joseph Falconet.
But months of brushing up against a
world of broad minded men had had a
wholesome influence upon the austere
young man, brought up in a somewhat
narrovV religious groove. Strancrely
enough, too. the girl's pale face ap
pealed to the tenderness hidden deep
down in his being. The rich voice was
full of feeling as he turned toward
her.
"Am I to understand that your mood
is not to be disturbed by me? Or. may
I walk home with you?" Â«
"The mood is gone, and to be frank
I did feel Just a bit 'creepy' as I came
out through the church yard, so shall
be glad of your company. Absorbed
in meditation. I remained longer than
I intended and fear my father may be
anxious."
The mention of Mr. Hartmann's
name cast a sudden gloom oVer Fal
entirely different religious grounds
upon which he and his companion
stood. As he looked at the serene
countenance at his side, on which
there seemed the afterglow of a reli
gious exaltation, he resolved to learn,
if possible, what her religious convic
tions were. Yet, in a measure, he
dreaded hearing them. But the very
strength of his nature demanded the
truth, without counting the cost of
personal distress. He asked some
what abruptly:
"Miss Hartmann, do you attend Lady
Bertram's salon, where that Indian
Kusinara is heaping up untold misery
for 'those who imbibe his precepts?"
A sudden shock went through her
at his unexpected question. She gath
ered herself together quickly and re
plied with her usual calmness:
"I have been there three or four
times, but I do not like the atmosphere
â to me it seems fraught with an in
tensity which is dangerous. Yet,"
turning her large serious eyes toward
him, "I believe you misjudge the Budd
hist. He is a scholarly man and
speaks with a convincing earnestness
which can result only from the sincer
ity of his belief and too easily carries
conviction to hearts not held in safe
keeping by our own faith."
"Then you are a stanch supporter
of the Church of England?" he asked,
surprised.
"I am a firm believer In the divinity
of our Bible."
He felt the relied rebuke contained
in her answer, but, contrary to his
usual custom, was In no way provoked
to an argument of Justification. He felt

only relief that this nature had not
been contaminated by what he con
sidered the blasphemous doctrines
which had been floating about in her
home atmosphere.
'I could not fail," she continued, "to
be impressed with the beauty of some
of the beliefs which the Buddhist ex
pounded. Unquestionably all religions
must have as a groundwork certain
beautiful truths, else would they never
strike the human heart. But why,"
she clasped her hands and turned
toward him impulsively â "Oh! why â do
people find it necessary to turn from
the God whose goodness guided the
children of Israel through the wilder
ness with a cloud by day and a pillar
of fire by night to worship at stranga
altars?"
Infected by her enthusiasm he said:
"The divine influence is with us as
much to-day as it was then. We have
only to listen to the 'still small voice'

have perhaps heard people praise my
eloquence â If my words are fraught
with power it is only because I pray
daily that my life shall be the means
of bringing both temporal and spiritual
relief to the poor and afflicted. We see
ourselves menaced on every side by
avarice, cruelty and greed. The op
pression of the poor must cease and
their condition be somewhat amelior
ated ere we can hope to touch the soul
buried deep under stress of poverty
and bitterness of heart."
It was with a shock that he realized
they had reached her father's house.
When he bade her good-night his
fingers pressed hers for a moment, and
as he strdde on alone in the direction
df home he suddenly felt the night
lacked something.
Lord Bertram passed into his wife's
boudoir. A frown was noticeable on
his usually impassive face.
"Claribel."
His voice came with a certain dis
sonance to the ears of Lady Bertram,
who was looking picturesque in a
dainty negligee of silk and lace as she
sat by the open fire in a sort of day
dream in which, through half-closed
eyes, she pictured a millennium which
should consist of souls, otherwise lost,
arriving at this state of ecstacy
through her instrumentality. Her hus
band's voice aroused her and she
turned her eyes toward him.
"Claribel," he continued, "I have al
ways given you. the privilege of living
your life according to your inclinations.
Have I ever thwarted you in any reas
onable wish?" Hearing no reply,
he continued, "you know I have not.
Yet I tell you I am not pleased with
your present course. If you choose to
dabble in Oriental philosophy and have
picturesque priestÃ about the place, I
do not mind. But to have our home
the center of a cult which believes the
wretchedness of mankind can be miti
gated only by the extermination of the
race is carrying matters beyond thÂ«
point of reason. I do not object to thÂ«
Buddhist who seems a harmless vision
ary except that he is unconsciously the
instrument of Hartmann and his mys
terious friend, who have drunk too
deeply of a materialistic philosophy
which would shake the moral pillars of
our country. Let them grovel In their
pessimism, but leave younger unformed
minds to a more wholesome influence.
As I passed the library Ermyntrude
and Gaston sat as if entranced before
a volume of can you guess what?"
Lady Bertram shook her head, smiling
inscrutably.
"They were reading 'Schopenhauer
on Suicide' and when I expressed dis
approval that any young girl should
read his philosophy both immediately
became indignant. Is this," I asked,
"the literature the Buadhist recom
mends to young minds?"
"Oh, no," they replied in a breath,
"but Mr. Hartmann and his friend"â
here they paused as if betraying a
secret. "I tell you, Claribel, trouble
will come out of all this. I don't like
Ermyntrude's fanatical talk and Gas
ton is ever to be reckoned on as an
uncertain quantity. I demand that
from this hour a stop be put to all
this nonsense. It is distasteful to me,
as you know, to have to speak in this
v/ay."
He turned and left the room.
" Lady Bertram immediately went to
the library. Opening the door she ex
claimed:
"We are undone. Lord Bertram for
bids Kusinara the house and we shall
no longer be permitted to enlighten and
influence mankind."
"Are you sure hi 3 decision Is final?"
Gaston asked.
"Unquestionably," came in Lady
Bertram's intense tones. She was too
absorbed in contemplating the rather
enviable light in which her persecu
tions would place her with the coterie
which had frequented her house to no
tice the significant glances exchanged
by Ermyntrude and Gaston â glances
which needed no words to record an
unspoken vow. Their faces expressed
too plainly a sort of fanatic ecstacy.
Angela Hartmann had been dining
wttn the Falconets and It was now no
longer a source of surprise to the fam
ily that Joseph should walk homo with
her. Matters were certainly pointing
in one direction, and while Mr. Hart
mann's philosophy shocked Mrs. Fal
conet yet it was evident that Angela
had not been tainted by it. although
it doubtless accounted for her not
having that vital interest in distribut

with much complacency in her own

her father's grounds to feel Joseph
gently push her into a garden chair <Â«vi

"Angela, dear," he said ha thm tones

dreadful, liut worse follow

themselves and rose into a peak, the
mule sliding swiftly to Ike apex, stiil
holding Me with his uncanny eyes.
There came a shock and Oscar said:
"For the Lord's sake, kid: They've
been braying away on that breakfast
horn for the last five minutes. Hustle."
I found mystlf upon my hands and
knees; in v cabin, all right, but the
cabin war on the prairie. I looked
around, stupid with sleep. The famil
iar sight* met my eye â Oscar tiptoeing
about, bow-legged, arms spread like
wings, drawing hie breath through his
teeth, after the fashion of half-frozen
people. Old Charley sat humped up
in the corner, sucking his cob pipe. The
stove was giving forth a smell of hot
iron and not heat, as usual. On it
rested a washbasin, wherein some snow
was melting for the morning ablutious.
A candle projected a eon of palpable
yellow gloom into the gray mass of icy
morning air.
I dressed rapidly. A* I slept in over
coat and cap, this was no great matter.
A pair of German socks and arctics
completed my attire. Evidently I had
been put upon the floor by the hand of
Oscar. For this, when Oscar stretched
his nether garment tight, in. the act
of washing nib face, I smote him upon
the fullness thereof with a long plug
of chewing tobacco. "Aow!" he yelled,
recurving Uke a bow and putting hi*
hands to his wound. Promptly we
clinched and fell upon old Charley. To
the floor the three went, amid a shower
of sparks from the cob pipe.
"You dam pesky kids!" said the
angry voice of Charles (the timbre of
that voice, after traveling through four
Inches of nose, is beyond imitation).
"Get ofTn me! Quit now! Stop yÂ«sr
blame foolln'!"
Oscar and I swallowed our giggles
and rolled all over Charley.
"Well, by Jeerooshal" came from the
bottom of the heap In the tone of one
who has reached the breaking point of
astonished fury. "I'm goln' to do torn*
shootir/ when this is overâ yea, sir, I
won't hold back no moreâ ef you boys
don't git off 1 n me this minit, so help me

This was a real danger, and we
â¢kipped him off briskly.
"Why, Charley." explained Oscar,
"you see, we got ec excited that we
didn't noticeâ "
"There's Steve now," Interrupted
Charley, pointing with a long; crooked
forefinger to the doorway. "Well, Steve,
I'm glad you come. I Just want you to
see the kind of goin's on there Is here."
Charles cleared his throat and stuck
his thumb in his vest.
"F*r Instance, this mornin', I sittln*

Charley was proudly erect. His arms
stretched aloft. Bis one yellow tooth
rested on his lower lip; bis face, the
thickness end texture ot a much-worn
leather pocketbook, showed a tinge of
color, as the words went to his head
like wine.
Steve looked at the floor. "Too bad,
Charley; too bad," he said in grave
sympathy. "But probably we can fix it
up. New, as we have company, would
you mind hitting the breakfast trail?"
"After I've made a few remarks," re
turned Charley haughtily.
Steve dropped on a stool. "Sick your
pup en," he said. Charley leaped at
the opportunity.
"There are some things I eh'd like to
mention." said he. We noted with
pleasure that he wore hts sarcastic
manner. "F'r instance, you doubtless
behold them small piles of snow on the
floo', which has come in through cer
tain an' sundry holes in the wall that

He glanced around on three grave \
faces with obvious satisfaction. Hisj
wrath had dissipated in the vapor of
words. "Nor they ain't such bad boys,
as boys, nuther," he concluded.
"I will examine this matter carefully,
Charles," said Steve.
"I thank you. su\" responded Charley
with a courtly sweep of his hand.
"Not at all," insisted Steve with a
duplicate wave. "I beg that you won't

"Ain't he the corker?" gasped Oscar.

" 'With scorn and hoomiliation,' "
quoted Steve, and stopped, overcome.
" 'I tells you what's the matter and

us. He turned and approached, an
awful frown upon his brow.
"May I inquire what is the reason of
this yere merriment?" he ask: 3. The
manner was that of a man who pro
posed to find out. It Bat on Charley
with so ludicrous a parody that we
were further undone. Steve raised his
hands in deprecation, and spoke in a
muflied voice that broke at intervals.
"Can't I laugh In my own back yard,

WHAT a delude of talk about
money matter ha* been poured
out over this land during the
last few weeks! The subject
Is congenial to the American mind
and Is never very far below the mental
horizon of almost every one of us. But
recent events have conspired to give It
unwonted prominence. The startling:
disclosure of sensational magazine
articles and the spectacular career of
a brazen adventuress have been the
theme of discussion in circles high and
low, rich and poor, learned and un
learned. Dining with a group of min
isters the other day I found that theo
logical and ecclesiastical topics were
crowded to the rear by the all-absorb
ing subject of finance. In fact, the
atmosphere is surcharged with it and
a good thunderstorm is needed to clear
the air and to restore moral ideas and
Interests to their proper place.
This popular absorption in discus
sions that range about money not only
concentrates attention upon things
material and remands to the back
ground things intellectual and spirit
ual, but it helps substantiate the
charge often made by foreigners that
we are essentially a nation of traders,
a money-seeking, money-loving and
even money-worshiping people. The
great advantage, howevsr, of recent
revelations is the fact that they show
how unsatisfying is the chase for
wealthy, how it saps the virtue of men
and women, makes them hard and re
vengeful, leads them to turn State's

down in the snow and crowed like

"Hunh!" snorted Charley. "Hunh!
Them boys hain't got brains in their
heads at all â nothin' but doodle-bugs!"
"Well, Charley," continued Steve, "as
you don't object and they don't object
and I don't object, for God's sake let's
have breakfast!"
"I'll go you, Steve," replied Charles
seriously and we entered the house up
roarious.
There in the kitchen was Mrs. Steve
and the "company," a pretty llttta
bright-eyed thing, whose color went
and came at a word â more particularly
if Oscar said the word. The affair was
at present In the formal state â the
dawn of realization that two such won
derful and magnificent creatures as
Oscar and Sally existed.
But they were not Oscar and Sally
except in the dear privacy of their
souls. Jfet how much that Is not ob
vious to the careless ear can be put
into "Will you have a buckwheat cake,
Mr. Kendall?" or "May I give you a

took some preparation for each to get
evidence against one another, pro

There is profound suggfcstiveness in
a recent remark of President Tucker
of Dartmouth College: "The time is
come when a man of many desires
must train himself to live for money
or train himself to live without a

tain in this country a generally preva

every great city are hundreds of per

simply because they have not trained
themselves to do without certain mn

â¦he one addressed started guiltily and
got crimson. It was the most uncom
fortable rapture I ever saw.
However, they received very little
plaguing. I can remember but one
hard hit, Oscar was pouring syrup
upon Sally's cakes. his eyes fixed upon
a dainty hand that shook under his
gaze like a leaf. He forgot his busi
ness. Steve looked at the inverted,
empty syrup cup for some moments in
silence. Then he said to his wife:
"Emmy, go and get Sally a nice cup
ful of fresh air to put on her cakes;
that Oscar has in the pitcher is stale
by this time."
Oh, those cakes! And the ham!
And the fried eggs and potatoes! We
lived like fighting cocks at Steve's, as
happens on most of the small ranches.
The extreme glory of the prairie was
not ours. We were wood choppers, hay
cutters, and farmers, as well as punch
ers; but what we lost in romance, we
made up in sustenance. No one ever
saw a biscuit suffering from soda
jaundice on Steve's table. And how,
after a night's sleep In a temperature
of 40 below zero, I would champ my
teeth on the path to breakfast! Eat
ing was not an appetite in those days
â It was a oassion.
Charley and I went forth after
breakfast, Oscar lingering: a moment,
according to his use, to pass a pain
ful five minutes in making excuses for
staying that time, where no one need
ed any explanation.
"I wish to gracious Sally and Oscar
would just act like people," said Mrs.
Bteve once in exasperation. "They
get me so nervous stammering at
each other that I drop everything I lay
mj' hands on, and I feel as if I'd rob
bed somebody for the rest of the day."
The interview over, Oscar came out,
burning with his own embarrassment
and made a sore mess of everything
he did for the next hour. A man must
have his mind about him on a ranch.
Once upon a time Steve came to
Charley and me, literally prancing.
We had heard oaths and yells and
pounds of a battle royal previously,
and wondered what was going on.
When he neared us he moved slowly,
his hands working like machinery.
"I would like to know." he began,
and stopped to glare at us and grind
his teeth. "I should like to know," he
continued, in a voice so weak with
rage we could hardly hear it, "who
turned the red bull into number S
corral?"
Charley and I went right on clean
ing out the shed. We weren't going
to tell on Oscar.
"So It's him again, eh?" shrieked
Steve. "Well, now I propose to show
him something. I'll show him every
thing!" He was entirely beyond the
influence of reason and grammar.

"You do?" said Charley. "Well, durn
your hide for that wish! What's got
into you to make you wish that?"
"Aw!" said Oscar, twitching around
on hia stool. "I'm sick and tired, of not
being able to say anything. If the
Bloux got up I could do something."
"Oh, that's it." retorted Charles.
"Well, Oscar, far's I can see, if it's
necessary to have a war party of In
juns whoopin' an" yeilln' an" crow
hoppin* an" makin' fancywork out of
people to give you the proper start
afore your gal, it'd be Jes' as well for
you to stay single the res' of your days.
The results wouldn't Justify the trou
ble."
Afterward Oscar told ma in private
/that Charley was an old stiff, and he
didn't believe he'd make a chest at a
jrasshopper if the latter spuked up
any. That wronged old Charley. But
Oscar must be excused â he was a sin
gularly unhappy man.
To come back to what happened. Os
car that morning had the care of Ger
onimo, a coal-black, man-eating stal
lion, a brute as utterly devoid of fear
as of docility. A tiger kills to eat, and
occasionally for the fun of it; that
horse killed out of ferocity and hate of
every living thing.
A fearful beast is a bad horse. One
really has more chance against a tiger.
Geronimo stood seventeen hands high
and weighed over 1600 pounds. When
he reared on his hind legs and came
for you screaming, his teeth snapping
like bear traps, his black mane flying,
a man seemed a puny antagonist, in
deed. One blow from those front hoofs
and your troubles were o\-er. Onca
down, he'd trample, bite and kick you
until your own mother would hesitate
to claim the pile of rags and Jelly he
left Ho had served two men so al
ready; nothing but his matchless
beauty saved his life.
Nowhere could one find a better ex
ample of hell-beautiful than when he
tore around his corral In a tantrum,
as lithe and graceful as a black pan
ther, His mane stood on end; hia eyes
and nostrils were of a color; the mus
cles looked to be bursting through the
silken gloom of his coat His swift
ness waa something Incredible. He
caught and most horribly killed Jim
Baxter's hound before the latter could
get out of the corral â and a bearhound
Is a pretty agile animal. We had to tie
Jim. or he'd made an end of Geronimo.
He left the ranch right after that The
loss of his dog broka him all up.
We fed and watered Geronimo with a
pitchfork, and in terror then-,* for his
slyness and cunning were on a par
with his other pleasant peculiarities.
One of the poor devils he killed entered
the stable all unsuspecting. Geronimo
had broken his chains and stood close
against the wall of his stall In tha
darkness, waiting. The man came
within reach. Suddenly a black mass
of flesh flashed in the air above him,
coming down, with all four hoofsâ and
that's enough of that story.
A nice pet was Geronimo. An excel
lent decoration for a gentleman's sta
ble â stuffed!
Well, Oscar turned him out this
morning, and then he, Steve and I went
for hay. As it was toward the last of
winter all the near stacks had been
used up, and we had to haul from
Kennedy's bottom, eight miles away.
When we started the air was still and
frozen, with a deep, biting cold un
usual to Dakota; the sort that searches
you and steals all the heat you own.
We were numb by the time we reached
the stack and glad enough to have
warm work to do. We fell to it with
a rush for that reason, and because a
dull gray blink upon the western sky
line seemed to promise a blizzard. We
were tying down the last load, when
I heard the hum of wind coming, and
looked up. expecting to see a wall of
flying snow, and continued looking,
seeing nothing- of the kind. There I
stood, in the air of an icehouse, when
a gust of .that. wind struck m â¢ in the
face. A miracle! In a snap of your
fingers I was bathed in genial warmth.
All about me rode the scent of spring
and flowers! It was as it thÂ« doors of
a .nt conservatory were thrown
open.
/'Chinook, boys! Chinook!" I called,
casting down my fork. They ran from
the lee of the stack, throwing th?ir
coats open, drinking: it in and langh
ing. for. man. we were weary of whi
ter! First it came hi puffs, at tang
settling down to a steady breeze a3
of the sea. The sun that In the early
morning was no more than a pala
effigy poured on us a heart-warm:
tire. We bustled for home, knowing
that the Chinook would make short
work of the snow; in fact, we had not
covered more than half the distance
before the prairie began to show
brown here and there, where it lay
thin between mountain drifts. We
sang and howled all the way to the
sheds, feeling; fine.
Here Steve left us to go to the
house, while Oscar and I unloaded the
sleighs. â
Suddenly I felt uncomfortable, for
no reason in this world. The land
about us was rejoicing with booming
of that kind, warm wind, yet a sharp
uneasiness stopped me and forced me
to raise my head. For three-quarters
of a circle nothing met my eye ; but the
vanishing snow drifts. I reached thÂ«
house; nothing wrong there. Steve
was walking briskly out toward us,
smoking his pipe. Then the corrals â
all right, number one, two, three, four
â Lord have mercy I
"Oscar!" I shrieked, and snatched
him to his feet. He rose, bewildered
and half angry, then looked to where
I pointed.
Through the center of number four
corral tripped Sally, dear little timid
Sally, glad to be out in this lively air.
her eyes and mind on Oscar doubt
less, and In the same corral, shut off
from her sight by a projection of the
sheds, stood Geronimo. And he aaw
her, too, for as she waved a hand to
us he t bared his great teeth and clash
ed ' them together. The earth seemed
to rock and sink from me. Every soul
on the ranch was told to keep away
from the corral with the two buffalo
skulls over the gates, a warning suffi
ciently big and gruesome to stop any
one. What fatal lapse of memory had
struck the girl?
She was beyond help. We were all
of two hundred yards away, .and Steve
still farther: she was not a quarter of
that from the brute. If we shouted,
if we moved, we might bring her end
upon her â and such an end! When I
thought of that dainty, pretty little
woman beneath those hoofs, I felt a
hideous sickness. The man beside me
said:
"My God! My mistake!"
A corral opened on each side of the
box stall in which Geronimo was con
, fined. One .. of these was usually
empty, a reserve. It was into this.
that Oscar had turned the horse. Th**
other was the corral of the skulls.
Geronimo leaped out. The girl halt
ed, stark, open-mouthed, every sign of
life stricken from her at a blow.
Geronimo sprang high and snapped at
nothing, in evil play before the earn
est. It was horrible. We could do
neither harm nor good now, so we
ran, for the spot. It svas down hill
from us to them. I doubt that any
thing on two legs ever covered dis
tance as we did, for all the despair.
Geronimo reared and stood upon
his hind feet, as straight as a man. He
advanced, striking, lotmjing above his
victim. "All over." I thought, and
tried to take my eyes away. I could
not. .
At that Instant a white-halted,
gaunt, tall figure rushed from the sta
ble door, a shovel in Its hand, straight
between the girl and her destruction.
There he stood, with his paltry weap
on raised, unflinching. An oath came
to my lips and a hot spot to my throat
at the sight. No eye ever saw a bra
ver thing. ~
"At this a dip in the ground and the
eight-foot fence of the corral shut out
all within. . God knows how we got
over that fence. I swear I think we
leaped It. I have no memory of climb.
Ing. but I do recall landing on the
other side In a swoop.
Geronimo had old Charley la his
teeth, shaking him like a rat.
"Steve!" I called. "Steve!" And
then Oscar and I charged at thÂ« wick
ed brute with our pitchforks. All that
followed Is a tangle, bad dream of
hurry, fear, yells, oaths and myself
stabbing, stabbing, stabbing with the
pitchfork. Then a gun cracked some
where, a black mass toppled toward
me that knocked me sprawling, and
all was still. I sat for a moment,
smiling foolishly and fumbling for my
hat. Steve raised me by the arm. Ha
still had his revolver in his hand, and
his glance on the dead stallion. Ha
asked me if I was hurt, and I said yes.
He asked me where* and I said that
made no difference. Than, ,as X came
to a little more. â¢ I said I guessed I
wasn't hurt and looked around. Oscar
had Sally In his arms. The tears
were running down Ms cheeks, and ha
moved his head from side to side, like
a man in agony. Her head was Merle d
in his breast, her hands locked around
his neck. It was well with them, evi
dently. But limp upon the ground,
his forehead varnished red, lay old
Charley.
â We turned him over tenderly,
wiping the blood away. Steve's lips
quivered as he put his hand on the old
man's heart He kept it there a long
time. Then he said huskily, "He
gone!"
At the A words the sound eye of the
victim popped open with a suddenness
that 'â ; made - my . heart throw a somer
sault ;It was as sane, calm and undis
turbed an optic as Â«rtr regarded the
r world.
"G-a-w-n hâ â 11" cama drawling
through the nose of Charley.
We ; laughed and .wiped our ayes
with * our coat , sleeves and got the old
boy to his feet.
"Same T old , Texas." said he, feeling
of his head. The hoof had scraped In
stead of 'smashing. "Slightly ; disflS*

:' He caught sight of the lovers.
"Helloa!" he said. "Oscar's made his

him by the pair;
"Xaw, boys," he commanded. "Take

It was â¢ useless to try ' and make a

AUGUSTA PRESCOTT
*T < ERE is a paragraph dipped from
I â A one of the leading English pa-
X J pers: "It is with action one
%â¢ notes that, nowadays, ladles
dress in automobile garments for walk-
Ing as well as for driving and that
these comfortable three-quarter coats
and very neat serviceable hats are seen
every day where women walk and shop.
The leading colors are brown and gray
with a preference for blue for those
who can wear It."
So one need not own one's automo
bile to wear an automobile coat this
season. There come handsome auto
coats, hats and gowns which are in
tended for the outing: woman every
where. She who goes out to take a
walk upon the avenue can dress in
automobile togs with as perfect pro
priety as she who rides in a thousand
dollar "teuf teuX/\
Aad this imui UuU tho urn auto-
if.obile coat has become a generic one
to be applied to all outing costumes
that are made to brave the weather,
and it means that automobile hats and
neck trimmings will be worn by many
a girl and many a woman whose auto
is ftili far away.
Th*- automobile coats and the auto
mobile materials are at present the
smart thing in society. And automo
bile brown, automobile red and auto
blue are about the best colors in the
world, both as regards being in style
' and tor general wear and tear.
And, speaking of the auto colors,
there is a new cream which is very
much worn. It is called automobile
white and it looks very much like oy
eter white, which is gray. It comes in
the rain coats, white and lustrous,
looking exactly like Ellk. And it comes
in the bright finish face goods. And it
also comes in the lovely heavy suitings
which are worn for smart auto drives.
" Automobile white or grayish white is
like other shades of gray. It stands a
great deal more than one imagines and
it does not soil as easily as one thinks.
It will shed the dust readily and it
will come out as good as new if
brushed and shaken and treated to a
good airing upon the line.
Coats for Walking and Driving:.
"1 made a grayish white suit for Mrs.
George Gould." said a modiste, "with
â which to tour Ireland. She wore It a
month riding hard all the time. And
now she is walking up Fifth avenue
with it. It looks- as pood as new."
It is a heavy white or gray cheviot,
for It shows quite a grayish tenc. And
It is trimmed with flat bands of black
taffeta. The girdle IÂ« mad* or softly
folded taffeta and the stock is of the
same. The wearer carries a heavy muff
of gray fox and she wears a boa to
match. Around her neck there Is a
long gold chain, to which hang many
feminine belongings. A note of color is
Introduced in tho muff and boa.
The accepted cut of the new coats Is
quite straight, and they are either
three-quarter or just below the waist
line. They are very loose, for all gar
ments are made | large nowadays, and
they hang free from the figure.
Those who go In for the fitted coat*
are wearing the tight-fitting automo
biles, which greatly resemble the tight
fitting Newmarkets. They are abso
lutely enug to the figure and are so
built that they button up tightly to the
chin and cover the gown almost to the
foot. It Is difficult to make them smart
looking owing to their severity of style,
but one can do a great deal with a big
boa or a neck ruffle.
Much emartness is Infused into a cos
tume or into a coat by the addition of
bands of Eilk and fur and by all sorts
of little accessories. One very chic
three-quarter coat was made of cream
colored cloth, rough and warm. It had
wide sleeves, which were trimmed with
lace. And there was a band of fur
around the upper edge of the cuff.
There was a wide -over collar,
which was covered with lace and bor
dered with fur. This made a very trim
coat and one which met with Dame
Fashion's smile.
Women who are struggling under the
burden of an old-fashioned coat can
bring the garment up to date by mak
ing th*Â» sleeves more modern. If. they
are bell sleeves do not line them with
chiffon ruffles, for these are passe. But
trim them with deep, hecvy lace cuffs,
and at the upper edjre of the lace set
a narrow band , of fur. Treat the neck
in the same manner.
It is very difficult to talk about the
fsshlons at all without bringing In the
furs, for though the winter is at Its
height, with . Its backbone all but ;
broken, furs are still being . sold, and
really it is the very best time to buy.
them. One can do so much with the
little fur accessories that 'are found in
the shops now in such delightful pro
fusion.
A woman who has just bought a
handsome pelerine has discovered a
new use for its long ends. The fur,
which is a long black fur in one of the
pretty imitation novelties. is so cut
that the collar lies flat upon the shoul
ders with long stoles that hang below
the belt. These stele ends are lined
with crimson satin. And in the -lining
there is a pocket, whic) is for purse
and handkerchief. This is considered
very smart and the furriers say that it
is a style that will grow rather than
decrease.
For auto wear and for fast walking
tours, there is nothing as smart as the
little cap which now cornea in all col
ors and made of all materials.. It is
very much like the caps which the
men of the' Salvation Army wear, and
It is pulled down over one's pompadour
and firmly spiked to the head. It re
quires no trimming at all.
But the prettiest girls are wearing a
very decorative little cogue breast at
erne side and other pretty women are
wearing two Â»tit? little quill* over the
ear. These quills match the small
things in the costum*.
But there is an auto fashion that Is
much prettier, and that is so pic
turesque that it is being copied every
where by women who have taste in
dreÂ«a. This is the style which calls for
a hat with a wide brim, over which an
onto veil is tied. The veil is very long
end Is thrown over th* tap of the hat
and brought down over the ears arid
Â»JÂ»<! in a big bow under the chin. The
face and eyea are left exposed. This
veil holds down th% hit nicely and
kaeps the hair in place. Moreover, It is
incoming, for It gives the hat some
thing the appearance of a poke bonnet.
Auto Pokes for Every Day. *
One of the prettiest of these auto
pokes was in a smoke colored felt with
Â»at trimming of any kind. A smoke
â¢votored veil was thrown over the top,
brought down over the ears and tied
under the chin in a *ieat big bow. It
was immediately Â«frcctive. It was a
regulation outing atjrle with a very
fashionable finish.
There is a pretty actress In New
York who is doing the London caper,
as she will tell you. She is copying
the straw hat vogue which has swept
over London. Taking a big high
crowned hat of straw, with a wide
brim, she sets it squarely upon her
head, fastening it with many pins.
She now takes a very large auto veil
and ties it down over the hat in poke
fashion. She is all In russet brown,
while her three-quarter coat, with Its
mink trimmings, carries out the brown
idea.
There Is a great deal being said
about the extravagance of the season.
But, as a matter of fact, women are
not as expensive this year as last.
While it is not difficult to purchase a
highly expensive gown, still it is a fact
that a woman can dress better on less
money than ever before.
One can buy a greater number of
email things, to be sure. And one can
pay fabulously for a winter coat or an
evening waist. But on the other hand,
one can do a great deal on very little
money. The woman of taste who
makes things for herself will assure
you of this fact.
The silk oilcloth hats are very use
ful. They are made up In various
shapes and are pretty as they can be.
They come in turbans and in turban
ettes, which are larger than turbans
and are tied under the chin to keep
them from blowing off.
A navy blue silk oilcloth turbanette
was built upon the style of a low
crowned English walking hat. Its
wide silk oilcloth streamers came
down over the ears and a smart bow
se: off the pretty dimpled chin of the
woman who wore it up Fifth avenue.
The dreadful automobile visors axe
made more presentable by complete
f{ice pieces made of Isinglass and of
ether transparent materials. They are
now made so nattily that they are
good for walking and they can be
worn for golfing if one likes to protect
the skin while at this sp^rt.
Pretty Styles for Pretty Women.
They are making the auto coats
with dolman sleeves, which make
thtm exceedingly pretty, for they look
something like circular coat* and they
can be worn afoot or driving. There
is something very prettily feminine
about these coats with their wide
aiteves, with cape effect and with the
deep collars which look like capes. *
There Is a very pronounced tendency
in outing coats and hats toward the
graceful effects. The outing styles are
much less tailored than they were,
and, while they are very neatly fin
ished, they are* not nearly as severe
as they might be.
A hat worn by an outing woman was
in Â»ilk oilcloth, looking precisely as
though It were a "made" hat of silk.
Upon the front there stood a velvet
bow which was made adjustable, or so
it could be taken off and another one
put on. It was quite Impervious to
the weather and would stand a lot of
climate.
The smartest front effects are ob
tainÂ«i\ l now by the wuajintr of Â«hand
some stole* made of thrÂ»* kinds iof fur
and the full Ingenuity of the furrier* 'Is
taxed to supply new ; combinations and
varieties. . A beautiful , long; stole of
sealskin, \ the fur which has somehow
slipped a little into : the background,
was trimmed upon the ends with sable
tails. Stripe of ermine, made: the ends
showy and there was a narrow band of
white velvet between the strips of er
mine. In this : manner, the stole I was
made exceedingly attractive. / :
The prettiest â -, hats ; for all ? occasions
now are \ the Continental hats â¢ and, in
the name of Continental, a : great ; deal
is | done that was never done before.
The tri-corner hats are easily made. One
can take one's â * wide Â» brimmed hat 'of
last year and turn it up on two sides
bo as to make , a : three f pointed hat.
And this is a trick that is being worked
every day. The under side of the brim
is faced with black velvet and a bunch
of cream roses is allowed to nestle in
the brim somewhere in one of its three
hiding places. . >'.:,;
They take hats and turn up one side
very sharply. This makes a military
hat of the very newest shape and the
sharp turning up Is accentuated by the
trimming.
A woman who does everything ex
actly accordingly to Dame Fashion's
wishes procured a hat of gray chenille.
It was a soft velvety affair ail in a
shade of gray. Around the crown
there was a big fold of white mallne,
reinfdrced with a little blue velvet. The
hat was turned up very sharply at one
Bide and, where it was turned up there
was secured a bunch of creamy pink
roses. There were many green leaves
and the bunch looked very smart in
deed.
A Choice of Smart Fashions.
Another hat was caught up at one
side with a long plume which was
trailed over the top of the hat in good
Continental style and this hat was one
of the prettiest things of the season.
You can do almost anything with a hat
if you know how to treat It at the
Bide. For nearly all trimming is now
placed at the side of a hat.
There is a chance to say a word
about Marabou just here. It is, as you
know, made of goose tail and the fuzz
or feathers of the goose are made up
into pretty ornaments of wear. Mara
bou Is made of other materials, but it
is for the most part the goose's tail
which furnishes the pretty Huffy stuff.
They are finding many new uses for
marabou. One of the prettiest is as a
trimming for hats. A band of marabou
is put around the crown. Ostrich
feathers trail from the side of the hat.
Marabou and ostrich tips are beauti
fully combined in boas and in muffs
and there are some charming neck
trimmings made up In this manner.
One can dye one's feathers and trim
mings almost any color these days
without seeming odd. And, though it
is not a season of grotesque hues, it is
certain that fair womankind is dress
ing in many tones. This is partly due
to the Japanese Invasion of the world
of dress. And partly due to the fact
that the art of One coloring has Just
reached its highest perfection.
One must not forget, when speaking
of new garments to wear, to mention
the raccoon coat, which Is the warm
est, neatest thing in the line of furs.
It Is made up In the natural colors of
the coon and its style is straight and
plain with loose fittings and a wide
sleeve. It is lined with brown satin
and, with or without a fur hat, is
dreadfully smart.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
The woman who for years has cher
ished her laces of old ivory and who
has laid them away, and darned them,
and handled them with care, must now
unlearn her creed. The new laces are
so different from the old laces that one
looks at the old as though they were
relics of bygone ages too antiquated to
be beautiful.
They take these old laces and treat
them in ways which would have been
thought irreligious once upon a time.
Forgetting their age and the venera
tion due them, forgetting their an
tiquity, their value and their color,
forgetting all things save that they
nre made of lace, the woman of to
day gathers together her old pieces
of lace and treats them with ruthless
hand.
Getting a little kettle lined with
porcelain, she fills it with dye. And
she chooses a dye which exactly
matches her new evening gown. The
Duchess of Manchester, at the opera
the other night, wore a gown of cloud
blue liberty satin. It was trimmed
with clouds and clouds of light blue
lace, so pale and so soft that It looked
fleecy enough to line the heavens. Its*
color was so delicate that it looked
more like a blue white than a light
blue.
New Wrinkles in Dress.
N This lane, which was j priceless rose
point, : had been 'dipped in the dye ; pot
and : made . a lovely blue color. But
the worst ; was not yet done.' After it
had .been; colored blue it was treated
to j many threads of ; embroidery. Silks
were darned in and out of the lace un
til whole patterns were ; outlined.
There ; were pink roses, : ; pale green
leaves and â  all "i sorts of Â« pretty ',tracer
ies. These set upon a: , filmy back
ground, making ,1 one J: of Â£ the y prettiest
lace effect 3 you could imagine. y
: fli The* lace was what Mis* called out
lined ; lace. The " figures â¢ were worked
in silk until they stood out, giving the
appearance ." of % natural â¢; roses '' upon â¢ a
lace ground. ; Â. .'..'. 'â ':.: : .â ' . .?. *â .;/"â 
'â i : â â  A similar effect produced by a
gown of rose colored taffeta, trimmed
with pale rose colored V lace, f > upon
which dowers and leaves were â  worked
with charming design. The lace, in
S this case, was \ a pretty imitation and
was i Just l as * good $ from X every f stand
point as Â£ though It had ',be<Â»n real. -r, "~
The moral to be drawn from all this
is . that womea who i have I a little old .
lace, - whether il* be t real sor imitation,
can do ' a great deal with â¢it . ' They can
color It any pretty shade and for this
purpose there Is nothing the equal of
a good deep cream colored dye. And
they can work it in colored threads.
They can outline pretty flowers and
can make the lace as handsome as
they please with a Httle hand embroid
ery. It is not a diffloult matter to work
lace by hand, for the pattern is already
outlined and one need only follow tha
flowers and the figures to make some
thing h&ndaome.
And, while on the subject of laces,
one must mention that the deep ochre
laces are extremely chic. Take lace
and dye It a very deep yellow. Tha
deeper the better. Then work It with
many threads in colors of every hue.
It is absurdly early to mention East
er hats, yet there are busy hours in the
millinery shops and many a milliner is.

with lace. She is choosing not thaÂ»
delicate l.tee but the-._yery heavy lacea

the Easter hat will be covered with

Coarse lace hats will be the rule.

THE wife who is sensible and can

ThÂ» lawyer who Is attractive and

Where one lawyer falls in love with a.
client, a dozen are palpitating victims
of the stenographer's little wiles and
ways. Hence a lawyer has no business
with a Jealous wife. She might find out
too much, which would sadly interfere
with his plans and his stenographer.
A lawyer with a Jealous wife Is
wretchedly handicapped. If he has
wealthy female clients it may deprive
him of bis divine right to transfer *
portion oi their wealth to his rnn
bank account. If his stenograph*" b*
pretty, a wife may be decidedly de

should never interfere with hubby. If
there were fewer pretty stenographers,
legal lights might burn with a purer,
steadier rtame, and the fraternity be
more moral. The wife of a successful
lawyer should never interfere with
wealthy clients or pretty stenographers,
who are or may be useful to hubby,
and the non-complaisant wife has no

The wife of a newspaper man who
languishe . for his society and become*
unhappy because he cannct take tie
time to enjoy it with her, if she nags
him to that effect, simply handicaps
his usefulness. The strain of news
paper life is perhaps &.*eater than that
of any other vocation, consequently
a man's home life should be more
serene than where other lines are pur
sued.

There are other sta ions where tht
wife should not interfere. The clerical
gentleman is supposed to be abovÂ»

that we would not rather trust tha
more skittish matinee male divin

out on Bious angles. Yet we are loth
to criticize the gentleman who Is sup
posed to be adamant. Some of hts
clan have been known to be touched
by flre, but, unfortunately, were not
purified by the process. The wife ot
the ministerial collar exhibit should
never think hubby less *ood than he
appears to be. She should nÂ«ver be
suspicious of the pious old frump in the
front pew, the wealthy parishioner
whom he can always touch for a dona

wife who Interferes in this regard

winter I starred as night watchman in

HE MAKES MILLIONS OF MONEY BUT WAKES UP WOOSILY
>/ *T is a fact that interests me
I much," says Whiskers, "dat de
I hotel which charges 15 cents for
* a full dinner and 25 cents for
a bedroom is paying de owner
I per cent net on his Investment."
"Surely," says Mr. Paul. "It Is In
teresting to loin dat dere Is any kind
of use for money which pays 6 per
cent. Wit dat happy assurance all dat
a man neds to make an Income is de
On and Off the Bread Wagon
Being Hard Luck Tales and Doings of an Amateur Hobo
is where I begin to curb the nomadic
spirit and grow genteel and recherche.
For quite a spell crayon portraiture,
self-taufjhr. as a side line to iron mold
ing, did not strike me as incongruous.
Nothing la that wayâ in Chicagoâ and
I combined these arts with profit until
a female patron put me out of the pic
ture business. My system was to
watch the death notice column in the
daily papers and hustle for trade
among relatives of the deceased. One
Sunday a woman on South Halsted
street gave me a commission. Her lit
tle girl, of whom she had no picture,
passed away, and the mother asked
me to dash off a life-sized crayon por
trait of the girl from a photograph of
her small brother, whom she re
sembled.
"Can you make her hair long and
curly and part it in the middle, with
some frizzes in front?" the woman
asked, eying my rough and calloused
foundry digits in some doubt.
I looked at the photo of a boy, whose
short hair and projecting ears were his
only claims to beauty, and said I would
extend my artistic temperament in the
effort to make a girl of him.
"As for clothes," the mother went on,
conjuring up a mental picture of the
cbsent one, "I want her to have a
money to inve6t for to get it, and, wit
an income, any man may be happy if
he only knows how. But de example
you cites, sir," goes on Mr. Paul, "calls
to me mind de fact dat de hotel which
charges $10 for its cheapest bedroom,
and meals are not solved dat costs less
dan $5 each. Is not paying ground taxes
for de owner."
"How do you make out dat?" asks
Whiskers.
"It is a question which I will shortly
write a piece for de papes about," saya
Mr. Paul. "I has give de study much
taught and am prepared to disclose me
findings to a delighted woild, only I
has not been able to find a pen in de
house dats willing to shed ink except
at wholesale. De manner of de matter
is dis: De builder and promoter of de
$5-a-meal hotel was wise on de propo
sition" â dat wasn't Just Mr. Paul's
wolds, but dey is what he meant â "dat
dere is many good citizens of dese
United States dat has more money dan
dey has notions how to separate deir
selves from it. While we has many
good folk in New York who get along
on tree or four hundred dollars per
year, we also has a number who are
trying to spend a quarter of a million
a year in de manner which will call at
tention to deir excellent efforts to keep
money circulating. But do dose good
folk want to circulate deir good long
green in de dark? No, sir! Dere Is
notting dey is ashamed of in de busi
ness. Dey do not believe In hiding de
good dat dere is in de woild. De ex
ample of proper conduct is worth
much, and de folks who are parting wit
one-fort million a year want de woild
to see and copy."
"Surely, den," says Whiskers, "de
hundred dollars a day hotel was de
very place dey was looking for."
"But de stage settings was all wrong
delaine dress, moss rosebud pattern,
box plaited with velvet reveres and
double flounces around the bottom."
"Will you have the dress hooked or
buttoned in the back?" I asked, vague
ly, thinking she might not be quite up
in the prevailing style.
"Pearl buttons look veryâ but never
mind," she said, rather abruptly, it
seemed. "The back won't show in a
front-view picture."
So I took the photograph of the
floppy-eared boy and went away, a
crushed and baffled crayon artist right
Horn the jump. For seven nights, after
foundry hours, and two Sunday mati
nees, L struggled to change the sex of
that photograph. Ringlets and frizzes
grew all right under the magic touch
of my crayon point, and the fleecy
cloud effect in the background was
great, but the delaine dress, with vel
vet reveres, knocked me out. In all
my varied pursuits I had neglected to
take up dressmaking; and that one Job
co disgusted me with portrait work I
mailed the photo' to the woman and
buried my blasted hopes still deeper In
the sand at Mr. Crane's foundry. Gen
tle females, they say, have helped man
In worthy enterprises. Oh, tut, tut!
One day I met B. Arthur Johnson of
North Henderson, 111., which place is
not far from Mudville. While B. Ar
thur was being shoved, with honors,
through our college at Mudville, I was
learning the iron trade, that eventually
helped me Into trouble in various parts
of the world. When we met in Chicago
in 1887, B. Arthur was a Journalist on
the Mail, an evening adjunct to the
Times, since deceased. Kirke La Shelle,
present owner of a bunch of New York
theaters and a lot of other good things,
conducted the literary end of the Mail.
And F. P. Dunne, the Dooley man, was
city editor of the Times.
Well, B. Arthur Johnson took a vio
lent interest in my future and pestered
me two years with a bold propositon to
break into literature. B. Arthur stuck
to me like a ton of yellow fly-paper.
He haunted me at my boarding house.
He invited me to his hall bedroom
abode and listened to the tales that
flowed out of me as the contents of the
pitcher flowed in. B. Arthur. Journal
ist, said if those yarns were written as
related I needn't work in foundries.
He had a softer snap for me. I was
too modest and refused to believe the
good news; but the faithful B. Arthur
kept plugging my game from the out
side, while Dunne and La Shelle, inter
ested by the unselfish Johnson of
North Henderson, strove to yank me
into the fold.
Once I was about to yield and be
come a Journalist, when Johnson un
wittingly drabbed his own proposition.
We were strolling out Robey street one
sloppy Sunday in winter, and Johnson,
the Journalist, was picturing the joys
of a literary career in Chicago. Ahead
was a ragged laborer. As he walked
his broken shoes gaped open just above
the heels, exposing warm streaks of
bright red wool.
"Do yc-u know, I envy that man,"
said B. Arthur.
from de start," says Mr. Paul. "De
dining-rooms of dis notable hotel are
a string of Bmall rooms almost cut off
from each odder. .Dere is no chance
for a crowd in any one of 'em, and de
good man who is going to spend a
hundred for a slight repast might aa
well be spending ten cents for Frank
fcrtes and sauerkraut down a dark
alley for all de good he gets out of de
hotel. He doesn't go to dat hotel to
play blind-man's buff. Dat was de
mistake of de builder. I have a plan
to fix de ting all right for him. It is
a hard Job. De builder's plans was on
de blink to begin wit. De dining-rooms
are strung around tree sides of a hol
low square, so I shall recommend dat
a curious and nicely adjusted series of
mirrors be placed at angles of de cor
ners so dat de/ diner at de souteast
corner gets a full view of de grub and
rum soived to de gent at de nortwest
table, around tree or four toinlngs.
Den, sir, you will see de folks flock to
de hotel in such numbers dat de re-
Boives will have to be called, wit night
sticks drawn, for to keep de hungry
guests in line for deir tom at de tables.
Sir, it is strange dat when a gent is
passing out a little matter of eight
millions of good gold for a hotel he
will not consult a philosopher as well
as an arkyteck. If I had been called
in to give a few wolds of advice I could
told how to make a hundred dollar a
day hotel pay as well as a fifteen cents
a day one."
Say, Mr. Paul isn't de only wise guy
on dat proposition. If I wasn't a
little short of funs at dis season of de
year I'd build a hundred dollar a day
hotel for seven or eight millions, and
show de main bazoonus who built de
odder one how de game is woiked.
In de foist place he had a dippy block
for a press agent. All he told de papes
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.

"Why?" I asked.
"He has socks."
"All thought of Invading the world
of letters forsook me, and the careless
B. Arthur lost Just one year of earnest
missionary work. Probably he was jok
ing about the socks. I'll grive him the
benefit of the doubt; but, at the same
time, I did not yearn for a profession
that couldn't haberdash itself. Finally,
I wrote a long story, using a short
pencil, about a Mudville inventor who
went broke and bankrupted his friends
trying to perfect a device to make cows
come home and get milked. The Mud
ville cows stayed out nights, flirting
with steers to the next pasture, and
the invention would have been a win
ner had it worked.
Having seen pictures of poets and
authors carrying manuscript for publi
cation, I rolled my story into a tight
little cylinder and tied a string around
it. La Shelle, who had to peel my
literary 'sausage, said afterward he
could have chucked away the whole
business, only he had wasted two
years trying to get me started.
When this story was printed in the
Sunday edition of the Times the faith
ful B. Arthur Johnson came panting to
my beanery. Mr. Dunne, he said, was
vastly tickled over my flow of language
and wanted me to go to work as a
word hanger and draper and thought
decorator on the daily staff. La Shelle
and Johnson ribbed me up to tackle
the editor for $20 per week, but I would
as soon nave thought of asking for a
job as bank president. Anyhow, the
boarding house reeked with subdued
excitement wheh the Inmates discov
ered a Journalist in their midst. As
for mine, I was scared stiff â felt like
a man doomed to the scaffold the day
I started to spellbind the Chicago
populaceâ March 11, 1889.
The landlady and I held a conference
that morning as to whether the ethics
of my new profession permitted a
Journalist to carry his dinner to the
job. I owned a tin pall that rated a
knife and fork in a metal scabbard on
the side. In the bottom was a soup
subway, and above that some tin gal
leries for cold corned beef and pie, the
whole surmounted by a Jam observa
tory that resembled the nozzle cm a $90
camera. I actually started for the
Times office lugging this pall, but got
cold feet, went back and compromised
on a sandwich in my pocket. Also,
I carried a full length lead pencil
that had a rubber eraser at one
end and a needle point at the other.
La Shelle introduced me to Du^ne.
who spread the salve on thickly mid
refrained from noticing my hands, in
which pots of molten metal fitted easier
than lead pencils.
"How much per week do you want?"
asked Dunne.
"Same as I get in the found/yV'
"And how much is that?" /
"Eighteen dollars," I feebljir replied,
which was raising the limit W. but
Dunne didn't know that, and I got my
price. La Shelle jumped me later for
not sticking out for the $20: but. then,
I had my doubts. The idea of a lumpy
about was how much it would cost
to live a minute in dat hotel. Dat was
trunning away good space. De lay for
him to folley was to tell how much
Mr. Dis and Mr. Dat was spending at
de hotel. Dat would fetched de crowd.
Folks don't go and blow in deir roll
for de sake of seeing It blow; dey does
it so dat odder folks can see It blow.
A man wit a roll as big around as a
lamp is willing for to light de lamp if
deir is anybody around who needs a
light.
Why not? No man can spend more
dan a dollar a day for what he needs
â for what he needs on de dead level
â but if every one knocked off trying
to dope out ways to make more dan
a dollar a day, where would de woild
be? â on de bum! Folks don't go and
wolk for more dan a dollar a day for
de poipose of doing de woild good,
but to do odder people good, and the
woild gets the benefit on the side.
What's de good of a million to a man
except to spend it in a way dat shows
dat he has it to spend? Sure.
When I gets time to put up me
eight-million dollar hotel I'll soive a
table for de very rich dat will tickle
'em to deat; notting but milk and
toast. But I'll charge de limit for
does feeds on a guarantee to have de
price dey is spending printed in de
papes. See? A mug dat has notting
but money â not even an appetite â
pays me a hundred a day for milk and
toast. I uses part of me profits in
running a pape telling his name, and
how much he spends, and he gets the
benefit of his money witout having to
get sick eating tings dat he don't
want, and drinking booze he can't
take care of.
When I gets dat proposition running
nicely I'm going to start an oDray
house where de prices will be twice
what dey are at de opray house now.
galoot like me, who had lived the life
of a Siwash Indian, ramming into a
newspaper shop and demanding $20 per
week was a proposition that made my
scalp flutter. Just the name fourteen
years of ragged-edge schooling on the
underside of the world kept me in the
business once I got started. My habit
for years was to read the daily papers
from top to bottom, and I was, there
fore, loaded with language, spelling,
padding, punctuation, syntax, wind and
other essentials without knowing it.
While waiting to be sent out for ths
purpose of enlightening the public. I
sat in the office and looked at the Jour
nalists. Old and young men slid in and
out and wrote and spat and cussed.
One man had removed his coat and
uncoupled his starboard 6uspender to
give his ink arm freer action. A horn
handled pistol stuck out of his hio
pocket, and on his left bosom was a
badge as big as a fried egg. I thousht
he owned the paper. Once I made a
bluff at scribbling something, .lust to
seem busy; but my mouth was so hot
and dry and caked I couldn't jjet any
thought-juice on my pencil point.
Pretty soon the editor sent me off on
a job â a baseball insurrection in an or
phan asylum at Thirty-fifth street and
Lake avenue; only he didn't tell me
that. I found it out myself. Spring
was coming and the little boy orphans
took to slamming a ball In the narrow
confines of the asylum yard. The ma- â¢
tron called the game on account of
broken glass. A large and rebellious
orphan named Bradley had spent the
previous summer on the Poor Farm at
and dere I'll have a dinky little Cher
man band play ."Annie Rooney." "On
de Bowery," and odder music dat de
quarter-a-million-a-year gents like â
and can understandâ and me paDe will
print de names of every mug dat buys
a ticket. Dere I'll give 'em sometine
dey likes and wants, and dey will be
known to loosen up for it more dan
if dey was hearing de Neebelunga
Ringer. See? It's great!
Wit me hotel giving 'em toast and
milk, and me opray giving 'em rag
time and barber shop chords, I'll have
de whole mob in good healt and hap
py, and at de same time dey will be
getting de wort of deir money in press
noticesâ and I get de rake-off on de
pape, too. W r hat'
Well, wit me hotel and opray house
running on sinetiflc principles what do
I do next? I automobiles me patrons.
Does any man who is old enough to
have made a dozen million want to
ride a mile a minute on a gasoline
tank? Nay, nay! Folks automobile in
six hundred dollar machines for fun.
dey automobiles in twenty* thousand
dollar machines to get deir names ii>
de papes. Well, I has a machine fixed
up dat smells of oil, electricity and
street dust, and will break down if
you speak to it unkindly. But it costs
seventeen dollars. De motor power is
a dollar-a-day Dago inside de tun
over, wit his feet on de ground. A
ride from me hotel to me opray house
in dat safe and sane machine will be
eighty-seven dollars, and every time
me guests rides in it, de fact will be
printed in me pape â at de usual rates.
Do you see where I'm going to land?
Me, to de mlllionairs' club! No indi
gestion at me hotel, but de rate a
hundred a day; notting to bore at me
opray house, but seats fifty a trun;
no danger in me automobiles, but
eight-seven dollars a whirl. Say, if
Jefferson, where they had a forty-acre
field without any panes of glass in it.
He led an uprising of three small or
phans-one shortstop, catcher and right
flelder-who ran away with Bradley to
play ball on the Poor Farm.
At that time our beloved Uncle Anson
was skating around the world on his
stomach with the Champion Colts and
All-American.. In a burst of inspira
tion little short of miraculous I named
the ring leader of the baseball insur
rection Old Anse Bradley, because he
was such a kicker, and spun out the
adventures of the three young players
he released and left stranded over nlsrht
In a garbage box on State street.
This story was turned in to a
ferocious copy-reader whose pipe
threw off the aroma of a back
yard bonfire. While he read it I sat
in the adjoining room, hot and cold by
turns; then moist and clammy. My
first stab at Journalism, right off the
reel, was undergoing the test, and I
suffered the tc-rments of a fellow hung
up by the thumbs. Without going into
detailsâ shining the tin on myself
some moreâ Old Anse Bradley passed
muster and I became a reporter of
plain, blue, purple, old gold, green, yel
low and vari-tinted facts, but never

T a party over at old Brixentine's on*
/ I night they were talking about the pro

Peters, horse surgeon; the law by Anthony

Hodge, drawer of a map of the county; litera
ture by Stephen Blue, writer of for sale notices

it may be seen, that there was assembled a
goodly twentieth century company, pre
pared by experience and stimulated to
discourse upon any subject.
"The tire revolves faster than
the hub," said the ministâ
Mr. Nudge, "and It is
but natural that we, now
on the outer rim of
time, should move with
more accelerated motion
than our forefathers who
were nearer the center,

"Yes," replied old
LJm, "a good man. I
can recollect when we

Miss Nancy Hodge,
elevating her eyebrows,
exclaimed: "Foe pity

"Yes," said old L.im,
"and the chances were
that the fellow that was
sent after the chunk of
fire would be drunk be

The young lady was regarding her

from the scene of her tumble.

favor and went far toward excusing his
111-chosen frivolity of the day before.
Miss Barclay laid a tentative hand
upon his head. Don looked Into her
eyes gravely, but made no effort to pre
sume upon the short acquaintance b7
unseemly fawning*.
The girl smiled finally. "Whose dog
are you, anyway?" she asked quizzi
cally.
The pointer opened his wide Jaws and
laughed with a soft, panting breath.
Then he solemnly raised the right paw
and laid it in Miss Barclay's hand. Ctt
riosity took possession of the girl and
she tore tha card from the dog's collar
and read it:
"Dear Mlbs Barclay," It ran. "Here

expressed wish of yesterday. Perhaps
It Is a bit cowardly, but I confess I
haven't the heart to kill him myself.
He and I have been chums a long time
and he is thÂ« only being I know In the
whole South. So, while I express my
deepest regret for the annoyance he
caused you yesterday, let me bespeak
for him an easy and painless death, for
he haÂ« his good points. Very respect
fully. ROBERT CARLETON."
She sat down on the grass and puck
ered her brows as she thought. Pres
ently a light came into her eyes and she
gasped. Then shÂ» frowned and smiled.
"Impudent rascal!" she said. "He's
trying to get acquainted with me. It's
perfectly outrageous of him!" She
tried to be angry â very, very angry.
But somehow she did not quite suc
ceed. She remembered the picture of
a tall, flushed young fellow with a
well-bred face standing before her
with a look of miserable apology, and
she was bound to confess that she
was not able to feel Just as indignant
as she ought. She read tha note once
more.
"Impudent!" she said to Don. "Im
pudent â but â but clever!" and she
laughed. The dog laughed back and
whacked the ground violently with
his tall.
Then the real serious part of the
puzzle occurred to her. She did not
know the man's address. How then
could she send this valuable animal
back to him And, really, did she not
owe him an apology for her rude re
mark to him yesterday? He had not
been to blame and he had tried so
hard to apologize
After a while she decided to adver
tise â discreetly. It seemed the best
solution of the distracting problem.
She untied the rope and led the dog
around to the rear of the house, where
she turned him over to the housemaid
and went In to telephone her adver

Fifteen minutes later the found her

"Perhaps," assented Carleton cheer

has been washing her
frocks, her gloves, her veilings
and her parasol cover. And
now she is determined to wash her
hat:
be it known the newest and the
latest in ha^s are made of wash taf
and dainty lat â¢Â«â  and put together
in such a fashion that they may be
t&ken apart, or partially apart, and
washed. Then they art put together
and lo and behold, are quite as good
as new.
This then is a blessed season for the
home milliner, for it is bo easy to take
a ready-to-wear hat and bring it strict
ly up to date by a little trimming. Or
again, the frame work is purchased
and white lace and white insertion are
cunningly intermingled and topped off
with a cluster of rotten roses or a great
bow of soft, shimmering ribbon.
Many of this .season's hats are very
pretty and very simple anti therein lies
their popularity. The flatiron shape
that was worn to much in the winter
Is here still, though it is covered with
a multitude of Valenciennes and
scarcely recognizes itself. Again the
quaint Charlotte Corday is with us and
nothing could be sweeter c-r more
fetching. In fact, it is such a universal
favorite that every Tom, Dick and
Harry in the community will be wear
ing them and they will be more abund
ant than the roses in June.
To make such a hat get a wire frame.
Trie frames, by the Â«ay, that have
round, flat crowns are the best and the
easiest to handle." With the frame in
hand your woes have commenced. Of
course you must cover the entire hat
â¢with a soft, thin silk to make a foun
dation and a background for your
other trimming:.
So far, so good. Lace does not make
a pretty underlining or facing for the
brim, so shirr in a good quality of wash
chiffon and tack it lightly and rather
carelessly. And let me give you a bit
of valuable advice right now. Don't
be too particular about the length and
evenness of your stitches, for that and
nothing: else under the shining heavens
has spoiled many a pretty hat in the
very beginning. Neatness and smart
millinery never did go hand in hand
and in this day of airy, artless grace it
Is more than disastrous.
The lining in more than half the dis
agreeable part is over. If the hat is
to be all lace, the work is commenced
at the outside of the brim and scal
loped or box pleated round and round,
being caught here and there with in
visible stitches. If there chances to
be a distinct crown and brim, a piece
of soft ribbon marks the dividing line
and covers up any little blunders that
will come in spite of your most valiant
endeavors.
The trimming is exactly what you
wish it. Now and then tiny baby roses
of a lovely pink nestle softly in the
ecru lace, or a great butterfly bow sits
on the brim ready to take wings and
fly away at a moment's notice. Besides
this there is the useful ribbon quill,
one of the most fetching and at the
same time serviceable novelties that
has crossed from the home of hats.
Of a truth it is nothing more or less
than a bit of simplicity, but such
charming simplicity withal that it is
quite the neatest and the smartest seen
anywhere in a long day's walk.
The ribbon is cut in short lengths
and fastened closely together so that
when the quill itself is run down the
parted center it is lost In the soft taf
feta which falls gracefully in place and
covers all but the stem completely.
Of course, square tipped pieces of rib
bon would neither be graceful nor pret
ty, so each end is clipped at an angle
of about 45 degrees and when it flies
In the wind it looks amazingly good.
But this Valenciennes hat is not the
only fashionable lace hat of the season.
There are other washable ones and
fashioned of a heavy real lace of beau
tiful design. So get out all your family
treasures and see if you cannot find
some pieces that will dress up your
home-made bonnet and make it look
like a $50 Parisian creation that has
Just made its bow to the States.
Lace, you know â that is, real lace.
â is always a splendid investment, for
while a shred remains it shows exactly
â what it is. If it is really soiled it may
be tubbed or cleaned, but it always
â¢eems such a pity according to my way
of thinking, for it takes away that
lovely yellow that age alone can
give It.
If there la not plenty to cover a
frame there probably will be more
than sufficient to conceal the top, and
top trimming Is something which can
not be ignored these days. And speak
ing of trimmings reminds me of the
lovely pastel roses and the infinite va
riety of colors that are being so ex
quisitely blended together this spring.
If the hat is white or cream, ten to one
the flowers range from a cream to a
pink, from pink to lavender and from
lavender to blue and added to this by
â way of contrast is foliage in any num
ber of soft, pretty greens. And don't
think for one minute, If you please,
that these tones are shown only in
flowers, for such Is not the case by any
manner of means. Many and many a
hat does not show a single posy, but
it Is made lovely by a wealth of col
ored shimmering satins so cunningly
intermingled as to suggest that the
tall end of a rainbow had been
snatched from the sky and held fast
to earth by silken threads.
Really there isn't any reason at all
why any woman with two hands and
a little material should not put to
gether a hat, and particularly a lacy
one. this season. They are so easily
made and so charming that there is
little or no excuse for not owning one.
It isn't as though they were all very
elegant affairs, you know, for some of
them are only very sweet and very
simple; but no matter its value, if a
hat is pretty and becoming. I scarcely
see what more can be asked. The hat
that costs full $40 may turn a pretty
woman into a positive fright, and the
one of no value whatsoever brine "out
all her good points and act as a fairy
godmother generally.

costume more than anything else. A
fit one sets off a rather plain frock
and stamps it jaunty, but an ordinary
unbecoming affair turns a stunning
gown into the commonplace.
But don't imagine for an instant that
lace hats are to be the only ones worn,
for there are any â¢â¢ umber of airy, fairy
ones made of soft, crinkly braid to
keep pace with the sheer waists that
look little more than cobwebs.

has been used now and again for years,
and it always returns to us when elab
orate hairdressing returns to popular
ity, for it takes by far too much time
to be thoughtlessly and recklessly ex
posed to every stray breeze that blows.
The athletic girl certainly needs
something to keep her hair from tum
bling down, and it is no strange sight
to see her with as many as three or
four netsâ even covering the soft curls
that are beginning to cover the brow
again. It is said that Queen Alexan

it is a positive fad with her to keep
her hair looking as though it had just

too, automobiling is certain destruction

COMFORTING CARE OF FEET
(Mary). â The woman with tired feet
Is trying to succeed in life with crip
pled machinery. There Is very little
joy for her either In industry or amuse
ment. She is, as it were, always han
dicapped by her feet.
No matter how enthusiastically she
starts the day she is tired in a mile,
like Shakespeare's "sad heart."
And in nine cases out of ten It isn't
tight shues. It is often the wrong sort
or badly made shoes or shoes that
twist in the wearing, but American
women no longer as a race pinch their
feet. They seem to have come to
realize that the pretty feet must be
in harmony with the figure.
Tired feet, when not the result of
the wrong shoÂ«, are generally a proof
that they need some sort of attention,
not just resting, but treatment, and
fortunately the sort of treatment every
woman can give herself without ex
pense for doctor's calls or remedies.
The most important treatment for
feet that ache with the day half over,
that swell and burn, is the cold-water
cure. Every morning, regularly winter
and summer, cold water, as cold as it
will run from faucet or pump, should
be poured over the feet. Don't stand
in it. but dash the cold water over
one foot at a time for a couple of
minutes and then rub dry vigorously
with a rough towel.
This will leave the feet in a glow in
the coldest days and is the best remedy
in the world for poor circulation. It
will relieve chronic swelling and is an
admirable preventive for corns and
bunions.
There are, however, feet that re
quire more radical attention than this,
but any other treatment should be in
addition to this not in place of it.
"Where feet are blistered or calloused
from standing, the ankles chapped
from exposure and the nails brittle
from cold, they should be treated to
daily miniature Turkish baths.
Every evening before going to bed
they should be bathed in very warm
borax water (a pinch of borax to a
quart of water) and allowed to rest
in it for say five minutes, then cold
water dashed over them, and dried
with the hardest rubbing. When dry
they should be manicured at once, the
nails cut square and moderately short,
the skin pressed back with a bit of
celluloid or orange stick.
And then as a final comfort the en
tire foot massaged with oil or cold
cream, and done thoroughly so that
the corns or calluses are softened, the
rough skin smoothed and the nails
rendered malleable.
After a treatment of this sort the
feet will be normally cool, without any
swelling or pain, and in a fair way
to contribute to a peaceful night's
sleep.
To get the best results from this
care of the feet they should be bathed
always In soft water. Hard water
leaves the skin rough, does not loosen
the callus and intensifies any burn-
Ing or irritation.
Where it is difficult to get rain water
add half a teaspoonful of pure borax
to a basin of warm water for all foot
baths and a fine velvety smoothness
will at once be perceptlCte to the sensi
tive skin.
.An excellent emollient for the skin
Is also prepared with this healthful and
soothing ingredient.
COLD CREAMâ One ounce of sper
maceti, one ounce of white wax. five
ounces of best imported oil of sweet
almonds: one and one-half ounces of
rose water; twenty grains of powdered
borax. Dissolve the borax in the rose
water, and, if the weather is cold, set
the bottle in a pan of moderately
warm water, melt wax and spermaceti,
add almond oU and heat slightly; re
move from the nre and pour into rose
water quickly; beat to a foam with
an egg-beater. "When partly soiid add
two drops of oil of rose. Cease beating
before the mass is firm, and pour into
little porcelain jars, which shouid be
kept In a cool place. This cream should
be used in small quantities and thor
oughly rubbed in. It is so simple that
every woman can make it for herself
at a very slight cost, yet is invaluable
in the care of sensitive feet.
The best shoe for a woman who
stands much is full long, loose over the
joint and snug fitting up in the instep;
this enables a foot to spread out to do
its work, and at the same time pre
vents ' a shoe l from slipping forward
and rubbing: on the heel.
High heels are criminal for the busy
woman, and a disadvantage to the
grace and health of any woman. For
tunately they are only fashionable on
dress slippers, so that they can only
injure a few women a part of the time
'nstead of most of the women all the
time, as they used to when in vogue
a decade ago.
The American girl will only flirt with
that absurdity nowadays. Bhe will not
take them to her heart any more..
NOVEL. HINTS FOR THH TOTLSrT

dainty toilet accessories may almoet
rival the garden tp sweetnees by a*sox>t
ing this plan. Have the ribbons in the
lingerie and colored petticoat match,
or at least harmonize perfectly, wit*
the gown. If, for example, the ribbons
are of violet, make a huge violet
sachet of two-Inch satin ribbon and at
tach to the front of the corset. The
petals are easily made by looos tied,
closely at the base and conceal a bit
of cotton, which keeps them in shape,
and which also holds the violet sachet
powder. The perfume may be suggest
ed by the color of the gown only; for
instance, who can behold a delicate
lilac or rose colored muslin without
thinking of the blossoms noddinr In
the warm air? When wearing the deli
cate green sprigsed muslins the faint
ordor of apple blossoms or clover are
suggested. This may seem a bit elab
orate or even sentimental, but in this
practical world we need both, and it
is quite as easy and no more expensive
to be artistic in the matter of the toilet
as to have everything on one tone and
be wearied by its monotony. Tt will
be understood that the perfume is to be
merely a suggestion, for strong odors
are never in |OSd form. TÂ« pre
serve th 3 odors of the different sachets,
when not in use keep each in a sepa

MAKING SOCIAL BLUNDERS
(Twenty). â Much of the social tr
we encounter is of our own making
and largely because of our extreme
point of view. To set a standard and
never deviate therefrom is sur
make one ridiculous. Tact and com
mon sense are necessary even in fol
lowing established rules, for such
rules must be frequently varied to suit
individual cases and circumstances.
You certainly made a mistake In snub
bing the old friend of your father who
wrote to you when on a visit in the
*Â»wn where he lived and offered to
snow you the points of interest: that
he had not seen you since you were
a child made the Invitation all the
more sincere, and you should have felt
flattered that he thought enough of
the old friendship with your father to
wish to entertain his child. The idea
that you would consider his invitation
impertinent never occurred to him and
ought not to you. No wonder he was
Indignant that you wrote such a curt
refusal and Implied that he had made
a mistake In thus addressing you. You
certainly owe him an apology. Makt

always gained, by attending to the
good of a thing before its eviL"
TREATING CHRONIC PIMPLES
(Maria).â When pimples have become
chronic and are livid in color and sen
sitive to the touch, there is something
radically wrong with the diet, blood
or digestive organs. Usually it is a
combination of the three to a greater
or less degree, consequently nothing but
rigid self-denial in the matter of eat
ing and a thorough course of Internal
and external treatment will bring re
lief.
Torpid circulation is another cause
of pimples and regular baths are a part
of the curing treatment in either case.
Consult your family physician and get
a good blood purifier; refrain from eat
ing ice cream, greasy or fried foods,
and the drinking of strong coffee and
ice water^ Take at least two hot tab
baths each week and a tepid or cold
sponge bath each morning, followed
by a brisk friction with a rather coarse
towel to stimulate the circulation and
assist the skin in throwing off impu
rities more rapidly. Keep the face
scrupulously clean at all times and
never neglect the nightly hot face bath,
using tepid water during the day. Do
not be afraid to use plenty of pure soaD
and if the water is not quite soft a
pinch of toilet borax in It will render
it more agreeable aa well as more
cleansing: always follow the hot water
by a cold rinsing water and dry the
face with a soft towel. Facial exercise
is next in order, and for this purpose
use a small glass vacuum cud to
which is attached a rubber bulb. Go
over every part of the face at least
twice and do not be alarmed If it la
glowing red when you have flnishe-1.
for this means that the torpid glands
are being forced Into healthier action.
Open any pustulated pimples and
bathe freely with i-old water, to which
a few drops of carbolic acid, in the
proportion of three drops of acid to
one-half pint of water, has been placed.
Lastly, anoint each pimple with an
ointment made by mhrtng one ounce of
vaseline with two drams of sulphate of
zinc. Allow this to remain on the face
all night.

m a Jof a_work on "The Trend in
BjsJ Higher Education,** by Wil
liam Rainey Harper, presi
dent of the University of
Chicago, who. inasmuch as he Is now
doomed by a case of cancer the doctors
cannot cure, may have the opportunity
to write no more books. The words of
a great educator, and one holding high
place among those who are fit leaders
of the most modern thought, should
hÂ«ve close attention at any time their
author wishes to be heard; and when
that author speaks as one under sen
,tence of a death so close in time that
his woTds may be the last he will have
cent forth for the world's study, the
earnestness and wisdom of his speech
get a solemnity from, the fact of the
greet man's closeness to the great be
yond, the feeling that we may no more
! be Instructed by his wisdom and the
desire to let his life's work reach to
Its unhindered limits by being rightly
â¢c&oSi-.gr receptlves of all the best im
pulse he sends forth, so that we grate
[iully profit by his teachings and trans
watt what r>art we can.
80, no doubt, will his book be re
ceived by those specially Interested in
'â¢dncational problems and by all those
'who wish for the world's best ad
vancement. The thoughts of the book
â¢ere not for teachers only, for, as Dr.
â  Harper pointed out In his charter day
address at the University of California,
the university is the guide of the peo
ple and the ally of humanity in its
struggle for advancement. Much of
the power of the book is spent to show
how in modern times the tendency of
the higher education is to get closer
and more universal in Its touch upon
the great masses of humanity. He
thinks that the university men who
hold exalted place should be prophets
and priests of democracy, until, in its
purified form. It shall have become
universal. â¢ t
The work is a collection of papers,
"offered as a contribution in a small
way toward a statement of the edu
cational questions current in our day."
There are twenty-three papers in all;
some of them have been published be
fore, four of them were In the North
American Review; some of them have
been read at various dedications and
annlvesaries, but most of them will be
new to most readers.
The author tells us that there is a
trend in higher education at the pres
ent time, but the philosophy . of It Is
'difficult to formulate. Everything:, he
says, points In one direction,* namely,
toward the growing- democratization of
higher educational work.
One of the papers which will be of
â¢widest Interest is on the subject of
"Borne Present Tendencies of Popular
Education," and as "popular educa
tion" may mean several things, be de
fines that in Its largest sense It means
the education of the people by the peo
ple, and the division of the term which
ha treats of Is of those popular agencies '
â¢ad Influences not ordinarily Included
:Â£a our regular school and college sys
'tcsa, Ha arranges the Important agen
cies of popular education Into three
s groups, making the first those that
here to do with reading. Speaking of
'the press as an educator he gives this
i Opinion: "It Is not an exaggeration to
joqr that in its best type the daily
newspaper Is not merely a popular edu
cator] It Is a popular educational in
stitution, organized to meet the de
mands of the millions who look to It
from morning to morning for help,
f ft ****** and nourishment."
! In the second group he places such
agencies as the university extension,
with Its lector* studies and Its writ
ten papers; correspondence schools;
Cfeaataaqtmn assemblies; the Young
Hex*! Christian Association, the Chris
tum Eadea-vor and the Sunday-school.
In the third group he places such In
fluences as traveling, business enter
prises and fairs. He says the well
Â«Kgaslxe& excursion trip of modern
tlxnes, though It carer only a hundred
miles of travel. Is an educational
agency of the highest value.
As to the tendency of this popular
education he Bays that It Is growing
scientific, not "In the sense that the
great principles of science win enter
largely Into popular conceptions of life
and truth; but rather In that simple
sense that accurate methods of thought
will be inculcated: that truth as it Is
accepted will be something truer than
It would have been, something more
absolute." He Is quite sure also that
the tread In popular education is be
coming more ethical and spiritual.
Notwithstanding the teachings of sci
ence, the Ideal Is playing a larger part
In the drama of human life. In his
Judgment the greatest piece of popu
lar education that was ever doxfe was
that education "by prophet, priest and
e&ge* of the Israelltlsh nation." He
ends the paper with the assertion "that
the evidence is clear to him who will
but read it that a higher spiritual ele
ment Is indeed present In the great
movement of modern times."
On the subject of waste In education
he holds that no student can profitably
conduct more than three lines of study
at the same time, even when these
lines of study run dose together. A
point he is very emphatic about Is that
a student should learn the various re
lationships and connections of the sub
jects of his study. If he conceives
these subjects 'end departments "as
distinct entitles without relationship
he loses far more than one-half the
value of his work."
When on the subject of "The Old and
New in ' Education" he says: "The
modern man,' whether scholar or prac
tical worker, whether statesman or
business mÂ«n or educator, must know
the past, must be In touch with the
present, and must * anticipate the fu
ture." One of the contrasts of the new
with the old Is the I necessity now of
teaching psychology more thoroughly.
Itg problems "demand for their solu
tion along experimental lines the com
bined forceÃ of physics, physiology,
neurology and physical anthropology.
Xo longer the simple study that It was,
it Is now become one of the most com
pound of the sciences."
The subject of libraries is the one on
which he devotes most of his attention
in Bpeaking: of the coming advantage
of the new over the old methods.
"Some of us will see the day when in
every great division of the university
there will be professors of bibliography
and methodology, whose function it will
be to teach men books and how to use
them. It is pitiable to flr.d that many
graduates of our very best colleges are
unable, upon taking up more advanced
work, to make good use of books." He
thinks the library should have upon
its staff men and women whose sole
work shall be instruction concerning
the use of books; and that it will have
a new function to perform, that of the
ation and the distribution of
books. "The publications of the fu
ture which are to exert the greatest in
fluence for good upon mankind at large
will be endowed publications."
In his chapter on "The University
and Religious Education," one of the
best in the book, he argues strongly
for making religion a part of univer
sity training. "It is something toward
which the university can render a fun
damental service by encouraging for
it a proper and intelligent esteem. It
is part of the whole education of a
man, lacking which the man lacks
completeness and unity and conse
quently strength." In his chapter,
"The Theological Semjnary and Its
Civic Relationship," he repeatedly
praises the Roman Catholic ideal of
making religion a necessary part of
education. "It is difficult," he says,
"to foretell the outcome of another
fifty years of our educational system â
a system which trains the mind, but
for the most part leaves the moral
side untouched; no religion, no ethics,
merely a sharpening of the intellect
The Roman Catholics meet this diffi
culty; our Protestant churches seem
utterly to ignore it." Again this: "The
multitude of outside agencies now en
gaged in humanitarian work are suck
ing the very life blood of the church.
Here, again, the Roman Catholics
have shown a wisdom greater than
the Protestants, for with them these
agencies are In nearly every case those
of the church." Further along he
makes this remark: "Do we not
realize that in all work, whether for
church or for country, tha largest re
turns come from doing Uie work with
children. Here again we may take
lessons of wisdom from Roman Ca
tholicism." The author has made no
general summing up of his work; each
paper stands by itself; it is only the
thought of the modern trend running
through them ell which connects them
into a complete whole.

Education
Its Moral Phase
rHE value of moral education as
distinguished from that which
aims chiefly at training the
mind for personal, material suc
cess, and this value not merely to the
individual, but to the whole of society.
is well explained . and the methods of
succeeding In it thoroughly discussed
by Edward Howard Grlg-gs In his book
called "Moral Education," 'Â, The work
is intended not for <â  youth, - but i- for
teachers and parents, yet youth, if
the time could be afforded, might with
profit read many selections from its
chapters, for they would surely help
them to appreciate what wise heads and
kind hearts were trying to do for and
make of them, and so grow, more ; re
sponsive to that calling forth to ef
fective being and acting which experts
in pedagogy. . ever study to make in
most constantly persuading way.
The author, mentioning the fact i that
life and nature are the great 1 educat
ors certain to be effectual, and that
teacher and parent can but supplement
those two great molders of the i, de
veloping personality, : wisely calls' f at
tention to there being often, a very
narrow margin between success , and
failure of a life, and that tills margin
is largely within the control of artifi
cial education. Realizing that the art .
of the pedagogue can be but supple
~ mental to the development wrought by
life and nature he would seek sugges
tions to aid his skill from these - two
great molders of adolescence,-, and -so
has absorbed from Browning this: "

Starting out with 7an interesting
chapter called ; "The Child * World," jhe j
gives two aspects of I that life for con
siderationâtwo â â¢ lines of thought to ) fol
low out In regard to It. One, the more '
obvious and generally recognized, that
childhood and . youth t are . a ' preparation ;:
for mature,, life; and the other, per- V
haps less often . considered than , it
should be, that it is a world of its own, .
with its own sorrows arid \ Its own Joys, .

is carefully given. with regard to that
other weighty ! matter that - the child :.\: .\
iB father of the man. . Nothing, he
says, makes for general wretchedness
more completely than a life In which
each phase stands whimsically apart
from all the rest. And this: "Each
moment is a new opportunity to live,
but our power to utilize It depends
upon what we have done in all the
yesterdays." This thought he links
with the further thought of heredity
and "Karma," and extends that to the
consideration of the Individual being
In harmony with the whole of life lest
It lose its meaning.
Following this comes the chapter on
"The Unity of Human Life," showing
that but fior the fact of our general
likeness in fundamentals no education
would be practical, for no principles
could be laid down that would apply to
aIL "The potentiality of humanity is
wrapped up in each Individual." "Each
person is a kind of epitome of human
ity, able therefore to appreciate the
lives of others."
The balancing thought to this, "The
Uniqueness of Each Personality," is
made the subject of the third chapter;
and so on our author goes in an orderly
evolving of all the leading branches
of the subject the true student of edu
cation should have his mind lead out
to thoroughly explore. In "The Two
Principles of Moral Evolution" he
divides the process Into what he em
phasizes as first a "gradual substitu
tion of an integrating end of conduct,
for the mere pull or push of desire as
an end of conduct," and, second, as the
gradual extension of sympathy over
an ever widening area of life, so that
the individual comes to feel the pain
and Joy of all other lives as somewhat
like his own.
One of the most Important parts of
the work is the chapter dealing with
the relation of moral culture to other
aspects of education. This is perhaps
the core cf his work; the place where
he goes most directly to what he set
out as the aim of the book's thought.
It Is surely widest in its appeal, too,
for while many may be lukewarm as
to moral education all are ardent for
education, and so where the perfection
of the one is cleverly shown to be Im
possible without the complementing of
the other the result is a kindling of
Interest In the less kind Just for
education's Bole sake. The best quota
tion he has selected for this ' chapter
comes from a woman, Mary G. Chand
ler, In "The Elements of Character,"
which culling begins with the words,
"We cannot think wisely unless we im
agine truly, and love rightly as well as
warmly." This chapter is next in in
terest to the best, which the writer
places at the end of his labors and
calls "The Relation of Moral to Relig
ious Education."
In this last he handles his subject
with such tact and such a wideness
that it would seem no one religious
sect could take exceptions to his Inter
pretation of what the essentials of re
ligion are, and in what way they
should be taught In the schools. He
would begin, as the flrst element of re
ligious education, "to waken wonder in
the presence of the immensity and mys
tery of the universe, awe and rever
ence in the presence of its majesty, or
der and harmony." Although he con
fesses that the problem of religious
education was outside the scope of his
work, he yet advocates Its necessity
and suggests its method. Moreover, he
makes morality and religion so closely
interrelated that the often used ex

JewisH
Encyclopedia
THE ninth volume of the Jewish
Encyclopedia, edited by Dr. Is
adore Singer, and published by
the Funk & Wagnalls Company,
has just been issued Its alpha
betical range is from Morawczyk to
Phllippson, and it contains as Its most
notable articles the ones on "Moses,"
the "New Testament" and "Palestine."
For things specially^ American the rec
ords concerning the Jews of New York,
Philadelphia, New Orleans, and ac
counts of Jewish activity in the States
of Oregon, New York, Pennsylvania
and New Hampshire, are to be noted.
It Is estimated that the prosperity of
the Jews in Philadelphia has been
greater than In any other part of the
United States. With the records of
the success of the Jewish communities
it is notable that they accompany i:
with a development of philanthropic
institutions to care for the le:js- fortu
nate of their race.
The subject of Moses is treated very
fully, giving the Bible story and the
Jewish legends. It is surmised that the
name was not one given In infancy,
but that it was an epithet given him as
the result of his work, and that it
means "Deliverer." It is held that
some allowance must he made for tra
ditional accretions in the narratives
of the life of Moses, but modern histo
rians with much unanimity of opinion
regard him as a great historical char
acter, the liberator of Israel, the me
diator of the covenant with Yaveh and
the real founder of the Israelitish na
tion.
This latest volume contains the arti
cle on the Jews of Paris and has some
good illustrations of the interiors of
beautiful synagogues. It relates some
hard treatment of the Jews, and eveu
the great Napoleon was somewhat
severe in his resections of them.
However, under the heading of "Na
poleon," we find that the Emperor is
considered one of the best of the bene
factors of the Jews. By the fact of
his breaking up the feudal relations
of mid-Europe and Introducing the
equality of the French revolution he
did more for Jewish emancipation than
had been accomplished in the previous
three centuries. The main object of
Napoleon's Jewish policy was to pro
mote assimilation by Intermarriage.
The German Jews have always re
garded him as one of the chief fore
runners of emancipation in Germany.
In the eight pages devoted to the
"New Testament," the Jewish view of
the Christian gospels is given to the
effect that the discrepancies in the
records extend over all parts of the
four and invalidate the claim of his
toricity advanced for Mark, or for
any other of the quartet. The gospel
of Matthew is said to stand closest to
Jewish life and mode or thinking, but
that it manifests & spirit of Intense
hostility to the Jews to a greater ex
tent than any of the other gospels.
Luke has the legends about the birth
of John the Baptist and Jesus as they
were current in Essene circles, and the
whole picture of them "as bearers of
good tidings to the poor has the stamp
of great historical truthfulness."
Mark has better historical and geo
graphical knowledge than the rest.
The gospel of John Is the work of a
Christian of the second century, to
whom "Jesus is no longer the expected
Messiah of the Jews, but a cosmic
being."
An interesting account is given of the
"Pale of Settlement," which is that
portion of Russia in which the Jews
are allowed to reside. The article on
mortality shows that the death rate
among the Jews, especially as to the
children, is much lower than of the
people among whom they dwell and the
puzzle of this is that so many of them
dwell in the overcrowded tenements
which are considered so unhealthy.
The work now lacks three volumes
of completion.

those who feel their need of greater life
oi>d light," made a new book called
â¢"The Measure of a Man," meaning
by that title "the measure of the
stature of the fullness of Christ," of
which Saint Paul speaks of us all
ccming "in the unity of the faith and
of the knowledge of the Son of God."
Although niind-cure 13 probably the
dominant subject of the writer's study
and the ohiy:f method of his efforts to
reach others with a message of help,
there is only one chapter, and that the
last one of the book, in which he goes
to this object directly. Tha foreparts
of the book are probably but subtle
preparations of the reader's receptivity
for this thing v.hich he seems to love
to tellâ the power of the mind over the
luuiy to help it to perfect health. This
leading up to his last ohapter, which
is a study oÂ£ Christ as a healer, is so
prettily done as to make these who
pick up the book likely to be willing
ly led on and on through Its pages till
the writer has made their attention
ready for the chief thing he has to say.
Much of the grace with which this
leading is done is due to the choice of
eloquent quotations with which to il
luminate the way he wishes to lead our
thinking. Starting with the first of the
four phases of man's development, in
his chapter on 'The Natural Man," he
tells us there is a purpose in this low
est as In every condition, and quotes:
Forever through tlie world" c material rorms
Good shoots th* immaterial. Night and day
Apocalyptic Intimations stray
Across the rifts of matter, sytnbo'.-njr
The bodiless glories that are out oi sight.
He believes that in God's great plan
the undeveloped soul is as necessary as
the perfected, and he mentions Phillips
Erooks' experience, "We forever feel
the thing we ought to be beating un
der the thing we are." And he again
reminds us of Tennyson's confidence â
can we be too often reminded?
Thou wilt not leave us In the duit.
The nest phase cf development he
talks upon is "The Rational Man":
"As coon as we have wrested the les
son from one condition another is pre
sented to us." How the evolution of
mentality comes from the struggle for
physical existence is pointed out. Then,
the desire for ownership being one
sidedly developed, "man becomes the
slave of the things he would possess";
but. as Patterson puts it, "we can pos
sess only as we become." This realiza
tion, of course, leads upward. The man
begins to pay more attention to causal
forces rather than to effects merely.
So he Is ready for another stage of de
velopment. This may be some answer
to the query he quotes:
When wilt the doing: of our doing- heal va â
Our labor rest as of our weariness?
On another page, anent the work
whereby the rational man grows at
last to realize he must reach to gain
his longing, we get the words George
Eliot puts In the mouth of Stradlvar
ius, the violin-maker:
My work Is mine â¢ â¢ â¢
I say, not Ood himself can .mak? maa's best
Without best men to help him.
Of the next stage, "The Psychic
Man," by which he means the flrst stsp
from the visible world to the invisible,
from the outer to the Inner conscious
ness, he says it should come gradual
ly, as the natural unfoldment after the
development of the other faculties, that
the possession of psychic power is no
evidence of spirituality, and that its
acquisition from a mere morbid crav
ing for the mysterious can never be
anything but a hindrance to life. "The
true psychic is the white magician,
whose growth and activity are entire
ly subject to the law of love." When
rightly reached it is said to be the
ante-chamber to the spiritual realm.
The fourth stage, "The Spiritual
Man," Is strongly done. For definition
of what such man is he needs only
quote Saint Paul and Saint John, but
he gets in some good work by showing
how spiritual qualities are always cre
ative â constructive. Everything worth
doing has in it the element of faith.
He quotes Carlyle's paradox: "Every
noble work is at flrst impossible." Then
he brings to us a few moments of the
day that Tennyson and Tyndal spent
together upon the Alps. Tennyson
paid: "It seems to me that you sci
entists, you analyzers of the actual
â¢ â¢ â¢ you miss all that Is most worth
while in life â¢ â¢ â¢ you are contrib
uting'to the world's store of knowledge
and the world is grateful, but for your
selves " Tyndal interrupted, "You
are mistaken. The true scientist Is
also a true seer. Just as much as the
man of faith, the man of vision. â¢ â¢
There is not one of us seeming mate
rialists who does not, if he be a true
worker, flrst feel bis way â¢ â¢ â¢ by
means of the same intuition â the same
insight, faith â that goes to the making
of your poems; that goes, I think, to
the doing of all honest work."
The second half of the book is a
study of Christ in four views of his
characterâ as man, as teacher, as
idealist and as healer. It is in this
last that he promulgates his views on
mind cure which in their statement
will to many seem exaggerated. To
ward the end of his work he reminds
us that through wrong thinking we
cut off our reservoir of power â limit
ourselves; and he leaves us with this
thought to ponder, that if we rule to
day in the only kingdom that is ours,
day by day its powers will be revealed,
and we will reverence the God within
the temple of the body by keeping holy
the sanctuary in which he dwells.

Success

' J The motto for, his title page he takes
from "The Castle of Indolence": 1

Of h's sixteen chapters he gives to
"Couraare" the first; place. Then he tells
of ""Integrity a Necessity,',' . and ' gives

Solomon is so well known on that sub
ject it is only necessary to mention the
word. But the author warns us not
merely to avoid wasting our own time,
but also that of others. He tails us
how Douglass Jerrold, the writer, onoe
was brief with one of these wasters of
busy people's time. Said the idler:
"Well. Jerrold, what Is going on to
day?" "i don't know, but I am," was
the reply. (
Of the needed quality. T>eclÂ«ion of

to whether it Is Inborn or acerulred. by
saying that the better opinion seems
to be that it is the gift of God. -Every
man. however, seems to have the Â«nn
of this quality, which may bo culti
vated under favorable circumstances.'*
Of "Success and How to Attain If*
he gives us this from Addlson: "If you
wish success in life, make persever
ance your bosom friend, experience
your wise counsellor, caution your el
der brother, and hope your guardian
genius."
Of course there Is much In "Method."
but Talleyrand condensed it Into four
words: "Methods are the masters."
On "the rewards of perseverance" he
expresses this opinion: "That man
grows unconsciously into genius who
observes vigilantly and resolves stead
fastly."
Lastry he tells what a factor hi suc
cess is physical culture, and reminds
us that as long as man can "he should
refuse to be 111. Illness is one of the
things which a man should resist on
principle at the outset."

Literary Notes
THE following extract from th#
Courier Journal of Louisville, Ky..
shows a good example of the art
some great writers have of correct
ing and recorrectlng their work to ever
finer perfection:
One of the most interesting, literary
discoveries that has been made in 1 , a
long time Is that of thÂ» original manu
script of Keats' "Hyperion." On some
of the pages there Is a good deal of
correctionâ a good many lines canceled
.and other lines written in; on other
pa^es there are comparatively no cor
rections â¢at all. In every instance the
corrections are for thÂ© betterment of
th's poem. For Instance:
Deep In the shady satin â¢Â«â¢ of a VaiÂ« -
Far sunken from thÂ« healthy breach at mora.
Far from the Aery noon, and Eve's on* Max.
The poet has written "Far from the
. fiery noon, and evening's star,* but
â¢ changed .It in the manuscript. A few "
lines further down he wrote first:
"Like clouds whose bosoms, thunder
. ous bosoms." Then he did not like that
apparently at all for he scratched .It
out and ; wrote, "Like cloud on . cloud.
No stir of air was there." The next
two lines - seem to have given him ' a
good deal of .trouble. He wrote first:
Not so much lit*' as what an **tflÂ«fm'irtas '
Would spread upon a field of greÂ«A ear* 4 corn.
Then he scratched out "what an
eagles and wrote "a young vulture/*. "*
But on re-reading the - manuscript he
scratched out both eagle and vulture
and left:
Not so much life v on a summer's daiv '
Hobs not at all tha dandelion's flMca.
-'' This was left unaltered In thÂ© manu
script and reproduced in the Wood
' house edition, but Keats was dissatis- ,
fied with It and changed It on the proof \
sheets.
For those who wish to know Eton;
about Maxim Gorky, the Rnsstaw :
writer, who put his life* In peril :
through his efforts in behalf of the
people before and . during th* St. ,
Petersburg "massacre of the/ Inno- |

J. Dillon, the well-known . English !
.traveler and Journalist, who had un
usual - facilities for - gathering his ma-
rial, both from Gorky himself and
his friends. In view- of reoÂ«nt events
the biography of this â born
practically In the ratter, reared among

WOMAN GOES
ALONE ON EXPLORING TRIP AND FACES
MANY DANGERS THAT SHE MAY ENTER
INTO CONGO
MRS. FRENCH SHELDON THROWS
NEW LIGHT ON COUNTRY.
Has Escort of Cannibals, but Real
Trouble Comes From Ants.
SPECIAL CABLE TO THE CALL.
LONDON. March 11.â Mrs. French
Sheldon has consented to tell some
thing about the adventures that befell
her on the remarkable expedition in
the Congo Free State, from which she
has Just returned.
As most people know, the motive
that took this intrepid American wom
an explorer off to the Dark Continent
for the second time was entirely, dif
ferent from those which have inspired
most of her other "expeditions. The
three exciting trips around the world
made by Mrs. Sheldon, like the famous
Journey through savage East Africa
which earned . her the friendship of
Henry M. Stanley and Paul dv Chaillu.
not to mention a fellowship in the
Royal Geographical Society, were un
dertaken partly for the sake of adven
ture, partly through a love of research.
But the painstaking journey Mrs.
Sheldon made through the Congo Free
" State at her own expense, to see for
herself â¢whether things there were as
black as they were painted, was quite
another affair.
Mrs. Sheldon says that at first she
simply thought she'd like to go to the
Congo to catch butterflies. The Free
State ie a famous place for butterflies,
and Mrs. Sheldon, besides being an ex
plorer, a physician, a novelist, a sculp- ;
tor, a playwright and a few other
things, is an ardent entomologist.
Once set thinking about the Free .
State, it struck this venturesome
American that she would like to know.
If only for her own satisfaction,
whether all the stories of atrocities
practiced on the natives thereâ some
being flogged to death and the hands of
others cut off because they didn't bring
in rubber enough â were true, and if so. i
whether these things really were done,
as has been asserted so often, at the
command of Belgian administrators. :
She was curious to know, in short, :
whether there was justification for all;
the outcry that has been made against |
the administration of the Free State j
under the King of the Belgians. i
AID FROM I.FOPOI.I).
Perhaps the fact that Mrs. Sheldon
was presented to King Leopold four
â¢ or five years ago. Just after the peril
-
ous trip through the Masai country
which she described in her book, "Sul
tan to - ill; â :. " had something to do
with the facilities that he placed at
her disposal as â¢on as he heard of
her errand. The King of the Bel
gians had word sent to every part of
the Congo Free State that this fearless
leminfne investigator was to be the
"fret-sl nerson in the country"; that
she was to go where she^pleased, and
see what she wanted to see, to ques
The San Francisco Call.
tion officials and natives and to in
spect documents at her own sweet
will.
â¢sidering that she went out to
discover it, it is not surprising that
Mrs. Sheldon's first business UÂ£K>n her
return from Congoland has been to
"he world what she is convinced
is the truth regarding conditions
there.
While not pretending that all is rose
colored In the Free State, she has
tome back convinced that an uncom
monly hard job is being handled there
lather well and that the Belgian ad
ministrators have loÂ£en libeled "by
missionaries with a taste for polem
ics," as she says. Almost nothing has
been said about the things that hap
pened to this plucky American dur
ing the fourteen months th:it she
spent in traveling, without any white
companion, from one end to the other
of about the lean civilized region on
earth.
TRAVELS MUCH OX FOOT.
Mrs. Sheldon has exposed her life
so many times in different part? of the
globe that she is accustomed to dan
gers and It proved rather difficult to
make her dwell on the perils of one
kind and another that accompanied
almost every ste\) of her journey
through the Congo State. With the
possible exception of her own expe
dition through East Africa, however,
it was probably the most hazardous
as well as about the most difficult
journey ever attempted by a woman.
Begun in October, 1903, Mrs. Sheldon's
investigating expedition did not come
to an end until the last day of last De
c rnber, .and it wouldn't have been fin
ished then had not the explorer met
with an accident while crossing some
rapids in the Congoland, the conse
quence of which forced her to return
tj> England. There was. however,
hardly a corner of the Free State which
s^hr- left unvlsited. Whenever possible,
sh" traveled by the State steamers
which go up the Congo once in two or
three weeks, and one ol the privileges
granted her by King Leopold was the
right of having these steamers stopped
at any port for two hours: but. of
â c, her visits to the interior of the
country had to be made on foot. In
00m way ph.- covered hundreds of miles
and it speaks well for her constitution
that she never lost a single day and
never attacked by fever or any
other of the ill? that ordinarily beset
travelers in Africa.
BODYGUARD OF CANNIBALS.
A lot of her traveling had to be done
through swampy districts, and for
days together she and her native car
riers marched through water that .was
often waist deep. <\ While on her march
Mrs. Sheldon was clad ia white duck,
and she says that except at such time's
as she was wading through the swamps
she kept herself as immaculate as Cap

usually numbered about a hundred, in
â¢ ciuding four or five native soldiers.
I and with the exception of their leader.
! every member of the expedition was a
| cannibal. Whenever she was in the
'â  neighborhood of a Government post,
I Mrs. Sheldon, of course, accepted the
| Administrator s hospitality, but when
in thr- wilds she slept in her tent with
! only two of the native soldiers keeping
I guard. Mrs. Sheldon was armed with
j a Lee-Enfield rifle and an American re
| volver, with both of which she is a
I dead shot.
On one of the nights she came within
an ace of being eaten by ants. Toward
midnight she was awakened by what
she thought was the pattering of rain
on the walls of her tent. It didn't take
her long, however, to discover what
really had happened. Her sleeping
place had been captured by an enor
mous "caravan" of ants, thousands
upon thousands of them. The floor of
â  the tent was black with them, and in
a few minutes they began swarming
upon the bed and attacked Mrs. Shel
don on all parts of her body, biting
furiously. Things of this sort have
ended tragically in Africa before to
day, but Mrs. Sheldon managed to get
off with a few bad bites, though the
whole camp had to be aroused to settle
the ants.
Only a few days afterward she had
the liveliest kind of a fight with a
wildcat or leopard cat, as it is called
in the Congo.
RESPECTED BY NATIVES.
In spite of the fact that she pene
trated into the most savage parts of
the Congo district, especially those on
the old caravan routes where the
blacks have been made degenerates
and brutish by the drink supplied
them by the traders, she never was
molested. She seems to have made
a really extraordinary impression on
the natives, the more so as there are
practically no white women in the
Congo, and the blacks regard their
own women merely as chattels.
Mrs. Sheldon, however, they dubbed
"Bibi Baana Penba," which means
"white woman master," and in some
district she was given the title "Bibi
Bula Matari,'' which the natives apply
to all officials of state and which
nu-Hns "rock breaker."
Mrs. Sheldon mentioned the sim
plicity of divorce proceedings among
the Congo natives. The Belgian ad
ministrators insist on their being le
gally married and a certificate is giv
en In every case. But when man and
wife decide to separate they just tear
up the certificate and that constitutes
the divorce.
MIGHT HAVE

OF ENGLAND
Ladu Kinloss of
a Historic
Family.
ENTERTAINS KING
SDectal Cable to The Call.
LONDON. March 11.â The British
peerage abounds in romance, but few
are more startling than that which is
recalled by the recent visit of the King
to a woman who, if she had retained
her hereditary rights, would now be
firmly seated on the British throne. It
is somewhat singular that in chroni
cling the King's^ reception by Lady
Kinloss at Stowe House in Bucking
hamshire society journals omitted all
mention of this interesting fact.
It is undoubtedly true that if the
will of that merry and much-married
monarch. King Henry VIII, had been
observed Lady Kinloss would be to
day "by the grace of God" Queen of
Great Britain and Ireland, Empress of
India am l all the rest of it. By his
will Henry VIII limited the succes
sion, failing issue of his daughters
Mary and Elizabeth, to the issue of his
sister Mary by Charles Brandon, Duke
of Suffolk, passing over the claims of
the family of his eldest sister, Mar
garet, Queen of Scotland.
For reasons probably not uncon
nected with a desire to avoid all need
less risk of getting his head chopped
off, Edward Seymour. Lord Beau
champ, then the representative of the
Suffolk line, swore allegiance to the
Scottish line nominated by Elizabeth
on her death bed and waived the claims
of his own family, of which Lady Kin
loss is now the "heir general." But
she is hot an ambitious woman; she
has always led a quiet and retired life
and probably would not change places
with the King if she had the chance.
She is the oldest daughter of the late
and last Duke of Buckingham and
Chandos, at whose death the dual
dukedom expired, but she became Ba
roness Kinloss in her own right.
Stowe is an enormous house â once
one of the great show places of the
country â with a Corinthian portico over
which "Ichabod" might well be in
scribed, for its glory departed in 184b,
when long years of extravagance cul
minated in a sensational smash and
its art treasures were sold and dis
persed. It was occupied for many years
by the Comte de Paris, and long be
fore that, in 1808 it sheltered Louis
XVIII and the Bourbon exiles. In
fact, it is said that it was the ruinous
cost of entertaining the French refu
gees which plunged the family into
bankruptcy.
PARIS MILLINERS DECIDE
FOR SMALL EASTER HATS
Feathers to Be Worn Costing Fifty
Times More Than Their Weight
in Gold.
PARIS. March 11.â The fashion fad
dists this week are preoccupied with
the trimmings for Easter hats, which
milliners already have decided must be
small. Whether it is a Louis XVI toque
or a crown variety, technically it is
dubbed plateau, according to the Rue
d* la Paix autocrats. Floral adorn
ments must give way to plumage, such
as pheasant, condor or white peacock.
The latter, owing to its rarity, costs
fiCty times more than its weight in
gold, but the imitations are abundant.
(siany new feathers have narrow bands
of ribbon twisted across, and others
have narrow edging of chinchilla or
other fur.
NEW RECRUITS
FOR SOCIETY
flnEÃlCflflS ENTER
Special Cable to The Call.
LONDON, March 11.â The activity of
the American colony in London in
social matters is causing a number of
American women who hitherto have
preferred the quietness of their own
homes to the glamor and excitement of
the London season to take a livelier
share in what is going on. Lady Falk
land, formerly Miss Mary Beade of
New York, is one of these, and Lady
who as Miss Burnley was a fa
mous Louisville belle before her mar
riage, is another.
Lady Falkland until recently has
shown far more interest in charitable
projects than in the diversions of the
drawing-rooms erf Mayfair or Bel
gravia. Her pretty house in Eaton
Square was always open to her per
sonal friends, but she studiously avoid
ed entertaining on a scale that would
attract public attention.
She is on terms of personal intimacy
with Queen Alexandra and, in fact,
with every member of the royal fam
ily. She and her husband are admit
ted into the society of the most exclu
sive set In England, but they seldom
figure in the chronicles of fashionable
society. Lack of means cannot have
prevented her from going in for a
good time in the popular fashion, be
cause apart from her own fortune her
husband is a wealthy man. She has
preferred, however, to give whatever
she could spare to charity, especially
to institutions devoted to the care of
the old and infirm. There is some fear
now that all this will be changed, as
It is seen that the mansion in Eaton
Square has been undergoing extensive
alterations in preparation of a busy
London season.
Lady Ross has shown a similar aver
sion to the frivolities of the London
season. Her home in the Highlands of
Scotland, where her husband owns
nearly 400,000 acres of land, has been
chiefly the scene of her social activi
ties. It was said that she disliked Lon
don on account of the late hours de
manded by its society functions and
entertainments and for this reason she
had no town house. Now she is look
ing out for one for the season.
POPE MAY UPSET
OLD TRADITIONS
OF THE VATICAN
Believed That He Will Spend a
Few Weeks of the Summer
at Outside Villa.
SPECIAL CABLE TO THF. CM 1 .
ROME, March 11.â The Pope has
recently expressed his firm determina
tion to spend a few weeks next sum
mer at the Papal villa at Castel
Grandolfo, and the general opinion here
is that Plus X is so far independent of
traditions and precedents as to carry
out his point. If he should insist the
whole question of temporal power,
which has for many years shaped the
policy followed by the Vatican author
ities toward the Italian Government,
would immediately find a practical
solution by demonstrating that even
with Rome in the possession of the
Italian Government the Pope is free
to come out of the Vatican without
any loss of dignity or prestige.
Naturally there would be much op
position to the Pope taking such an
important step. The more conserva
tive Cardinals certainly would protest
against such an extraordinary proceed
ing on the part of the Pope, but those
who know Pius X well and have ob
served the increasing independence of
his character entertain no doubt that
if the Pope makes up his mind to
throw some traditions to tne winds he
will certainly carry out his plans inde
pendent of what his close advisers may
suggest.
COSTIjY REPAIRS OX VILI.A.
Soon after his election the Pope spent
a large sum in repairing the Papal
villa in the Albano hills, and it was
repeatedly asserted that it was Pius
X's intention to use the villa several
week* during the summer. Such a plan
could not be carried out last year and
the villa was turned over to the per
sonal use of his cardinal secretary a!
state, who spent August and Septem
ber there, coming to Rome only once a
week foe a few hours' conference with
the Pope.
There is no doubt that the extensive
repairs made in the summer abode of
former Popes are not Justified by the
permanence there of a solitary cardinal
for a few weeks, and that Pius X's
intentions are to transfer the whole
papal court there during the summer
months. It has been noticed that Pius
X has never given up his yearning for
more liberty and that the increasing
pallor of his countenance, which has
now lost the ruddiness of former years,
is by him attributed to his long con
finement within the walls of the Va
tican. No one will therefore be sur
prised if Pius X carries out his plan
and leaves the Vatican for a 'few weeks
in the country.
CHANGE IN HIS HABITS.
Every one here is surprised at the
wonderful change which has taken
Pages 17 to 24
place in the methods of life of Plus 3C
within the las* few months, a change
which was expected after his election,
but which mm a long time in coming.
On the occasion of the consecration as
Bishop of Bergamo of Monsignore Ra
dini Tedeschi, who was a warm per
sonal friend of the Pope. Pius X gave
a luncheon in honor of the new Bishop,
to which he Invited all the cardinal*
â it at the consecration and many
prelates of the curia, including an Ital
ian deputy, Mr. Pucinelll.
Contrary to his custom of taking his
meals at the same table with his
guests. Pius X insisted for the first
time since his election that a special
table be set aside for his own use and
took part in the festivities in the same
large hal! where the tables had been
placed, sitting in solitary grandeur at a
small table and watted upon by tha
pontifical scalco.
YIELDS TO A TRADITION.
Those present were wondering at thÂ»
fact that at last even Pius X. the
democratic pope, had given in to one
of the most respected l customs of the
Vatican court, where, even when hav
ing a reigning sovereign as an honored
guest, no pope was ever known to par
take of a meal at the same table with
him. The late pope, who was a â¢tickler
for the conventionalities of the curia
during the twenty-five and more years
of his pontificate, never had a meal at
the same table with any one. no matter
in how high a position his guest hap-,
pened to be.
" ; In fact, the late pope seldom par
tock of a meal in the presence, of any
one* excepting his private scalco, who
has to be present and taste of the food
when requested before the pope tastes
any of It. It is not known what
prompted Pius X to insist on the ob
servance of the immemorial custom,
but the idea prevails that the pope has
at last become thoroughly accustomed
to his' new dignity and .' surroundings
and will from now on inaugurate . a
new era in which his democratic ten
dencies will no longer prevail over the
dignified ceremonial of his predecessor.
This was confirmed oh the same oc
casion when after luncheon Pius X
held i a reception for the prelates in at
tendance. 'Instead of sittii% familiarly
among 'them in his private library, as
he had done many times before on sim
ilar occasions, he led his guests to the
throneroom and. sitting on the throne,
entertained them in conversation, pay
ing â  particular attention, as the occa
sion â  demanded, to the { newly conse
crated 'â¢ bishop.
To describe the astonishment of the
seven or eight cardinals present is ab
solutely, impossible. -18
ECHOES FROM THE LODGE ROOMS
High Chief Ranger G. Q. Stewart re
turned last week from a visit to the
court in Nevada City. He was in that
city several days reorganizing the
court, which had been at a standstill
lor Bom< a time, and placed it on a good .
footing again.
Upon his return from that place the
high chief ranger detailed Past High
Treasurer Cameron to visit Court
Brentwood in the town-of that name
and Companion Court Carmen Mac-
K inlay of the same place and install
the officers for the current term. There
was a large attendance, and after the
ceremony there was an address by the
visitor to the members and of those
who are eligible to membership.
Companion Court Golden Gate on the
night of Washington's birthday had a
â â "â â 
:nation party in its meeting place
in Franklin Hall. It was a combination
of an at home, Mother Goose party
and valentine party, given un
der the direction of the social commit
tee, of which Rosie Young is the chair
lady. It was a delightful and well
cod affair.
The high chief ranger recently paid a
visit to Court Butter in Sacramento
and he was informed that it is working
in the line of entertaining the delegates
to the next High C'>urt that is to meet
al city.
F. L. Arbogast is working up a mem

Gate No. 204, Fidelity No. 222 and Sar
geant No. 368, forming District No. 68,
held in Memorial Hall upon the sug
gestion of District Deputy Grand Mas
ter .1. H. Ludlow, one of the most ac
tive, earnest and conscientious depu
ties of this city, was an interesting and
delightful one. The district deputy was
the master of ceremonies, and under
his direction the following programme
was carried out in the presence of more
than 150 members of the several lodges:
....
Overture by M. Benton of Fidelity

ments were served, a collation par
taken of and the district deputy was
congratulated for furnishing such a
pleasant evening's entertainment. Dis
trict Deputy Ludlow, who is compara
tively a young member of the order,
hat manifested an unusual degree of
interest in its advancement, and his I
zeal having been recognized he was ad- i
vanced to his present position and has J
also served as noble grand of Golden
Gate Lodge, and chief patriarch of Ori
ental Encampment. He is a member
of the Past Grands' Association; Can- i
ton San Francisco, Patriarchs Militant; \
of the Excelsior Degree Lodge and of
Jubilee Rebekah Lodge.
The golden Jubilee of Bald Mountain '
Encampment of Sonora was one of the
most pleasant gatherings of members
of that branch of Odd Fellowship ever
held in a place outside of San Francis
co. For the occasion there was a beau
tiful souvenir programme of, an en- \
campment tent in royal purple, on the j
back of which appears a welcome song >
composed expressly for Bald Mountain. i
The affair was arranged by a com
mittee composed of Grand Senior War
den C. H. Burden and Past Chief Pa
trlarchs E. L. Rehm, J. V. Newman, G.
E. Garrett and Elnathan Romans. ;
There was a very interesting pro- ;
gramme of musical and literary num- !
bers, besides specialties contributed by
C. P. Morgan, W. J. Barron, William*
Hartvig, St. James Choir (Mrs. P. at. '
Keefe directress). Professor A L. !
Steele, MisÂ« Carrie Â»E. Inch, Willie :
Arendt. Ralph H. Morgan and the So
nora Brass Band. During the evening
Grand Scribe W. H. Barnes delivered
an oration and later entertained with I
pleasantries. At the conclusion of the
programme the encampment presented!
the -rand scribe a valuable â  nugget
scarf pin as a souvenir of the occasion i
Brigadier H. O. Brower, cc-mmandlng '
the Patriarchs Militant of the Depart- '
ment of California, accompanied by his ;
assistant adjutant general., returned to ;
this city a few days ago after a sue- |
cessful tour of muster and inspection
of the cantons in the southern part of
the State. General Brower has person
ally since he has occupied his present
position mustered eleven new cantons
into service, and under his administra
tion the Militants have increased from j
3f'Q to 1076. He has reorganized the de
partment on a strict military basis. It
is now composed of twenty cantons,
eight battalions and three regiments.
The sreneral reports much enthusiasm
in the various units of organization
and that many are drilling with the
idea of competing for trophies at the
annual cantonment to be held in Octo
ber in San Diego.
Degree of Pocahontas.
At the meeting of Seminole Council
of tht Degree of Pocahontas held on
the last Monday of February all of the
great chiefs residing in this city were
in att-r.dance to witness the adoption
of ihe thirty-eight palefaces, by which
the membership was increased to 301,
a remarkable showin^ for a subor
dinate less than two months old. The
ceremony of adoption was performed
by the team of Oneida Council in a
manner that drew forth many com
mendations by the visiting great chiefs.
It was expected that the chiefs of the
sitting council would do the work, but
their costumes not being ready Onei
da's team was asked to do the work.
This council works in the French lan
guage, and this somewhat discomfited
Great Pocahontas Mrs. Bliss. The
council is anxious to surpass in mem
bership Manzanita 49. which is the ban
ner subordinate of the reservation. At
the close of the business of the evening
each of the great chiefs was presented
with a bunch of beautiful flowers by
Emelio Lastreto on behalf of the
council.
Potomac Council gave an entertain
ment and dance in its tepee last week,
which proved to be a very pleasant af
fair. The programme included instru
mental and vocal music and recitations
betweea dance numbers contributed by
Clemens Baier, Louise Lanzer, Irma
Lanzer. Laura Libbing. Arthur Kernen,
( 'if 1 Roche and Rose Vernell, the latter
a very pleasing and charming en
tertainer.
Ramona Council is still scouting for
paiefaces. On the sleep of the last
sun of the snow moon the council
adopted several palefaces. The team,
which was carefully instructed by Cap
tain Read, the drill master, carried
out the work without hitch and in a
manner that did credit to the instruc
tor. The captain will give the team
a few more lessons, and then the coun
cil, accompanied by its team, will trail
to othtr tepees to confer the degree in
a manner that will reflect credit on the
order as well as on Ramona Cc-uncil.
;< chiefs of the council are anxious
to make a first class record during the
current term and this is particularly
true < f Miss L. Burge, the Pocahontas,
Mis. J. connon, the Wenonah and F.
J. Bischoff the Powhattan.
Ifansmnitm Council No. 49, which still
holds the lead In membership and has
fifteen applications on the desk, had an
adoption on the last council sleep in
the snow moon. The team of this
council in the latter part of the snow
moon trailed to the tepee of El Carito
Council in the reservation of San
Mateo and was accompanied by mem
bers of the Manzanita, forty-six in all,
including the team. The team adopted
ten palefaces, after which there was
ial hour, a banquet and speech
making. The party returned to the
city at 2:30 a. m.
Alfarata Council will have an indoor
picnic in the Shiels building on the
night of last day of March.
The Maccabees.
Pacific Tent, at its first review In
March, had an open meeting which was
attended by nearly all the members of
the tent and the members of their
families. Under the direction of Sir
Knights Bonnallle. Tobias and Roberts
there was presented a pleasing pro
gramme of music, songs and specialties
contributed by Miss Lynch, Miss Hart,
the Badger Musical Society, Mrs. Orill,
Miss Jones and Miss Atkinson and a
mandolin and guitar club. During the
evening refreshments were served.
Bo) Lewis, record keeper, was present
ed a set of engrossed resolutions in ap
preciation of his services to the tent.
Gtoktea West Tent at its review last
week had a goody attendance to wit
ness the initiation of a class of strang
ers into the beautiful degree of the
order. In the near future the tent will
have a large class to initiate, having
fifty applicants on the desk of Secre
tary Freeman. Next Tuesday the tent
will have an old-time smoker and an
interesting programme of entertain
ment.
Lady Sarah E. Hedges of Mission
Hive, who was recently installed as
the lady commander of that subordi
nate, was for seven years the record
ing secretary and during that period
became thoroughly qualified to dis
charge the duties of the office to which
she has been exalted. It is her aim to
make the present term one of the most
Â fraternal and progressive the
hive has ever had.

Woodmen of the World.
The editor of Senator W. A. Clark's
paper, the Butte Miner â A. B.
Keith â is being talked dof as
successor to F. A. Falkenburg,
late head consul of the Woodmen
of the World. The vacancy caused by
the latter's death is to be filled by the
Head Camp session at Los Angeles in
April. Mr. Keith's firm position in fa
vor of changing in many important re
spects the business methods of the or
der, and his advocacy of retrenchment
and reform in the management of its
affairs, have led neighbors to urge
him to accept the position, though he
has not consented to become a candi
date. Mr. Keith is president of the
Montana Auxiliary Fraternal Con
gress, and has just led to a successful
ending a fight in behalf of the frater
nals against adverse legislation in
Montana. He was formerly editor of
the Pacific Woodman, the official organ
of the Woodmen of the World, and oc
cupied several important official posi
tions in that order, having been made
a life member of the Head Camp Ses
sion. Mr. Keith has been prominent in
the work of the, fraternals for many
years.

met with a double misfortune during
his stay in this city. A short time since
his only child died a few days after
birth and last week the mother passed
away. Mrs. Krum, who was a native
of Salt Lake City and but 24 years of
age, was taken down shortly after the
birth of her child, and despite all ef
forts to save her life she was called
away from earth. She was a member
of Denver Circle of the Women of

erly only by the German "Gemutlich
kelt."

Impersonator? Oh. another one.
what a bore!" That was what one said
last Sunday night as "Willy" Zimmer
man walked on the Orpheum stage.
Neither was there any reason, only
from the gentleman's exceptionally un
assuming appearance, to expect any
thing different from the usual gallery
of grease-painted, chromo-lithographic
caricatures of McKinley,- Sousa and
George Washington that the usual im
personator deals in.
â¢'I shall attempt to imitate Richard
Wagner," Mr. Zlm.aerman modestly
announced, and then as He walked off
Stage Director Rosner struck up a
wonderful imitation of a 75-man ar
chestra doing the "Flying Dutchman."
It was, by the way. one of the best
imitations ever heard at the Orpheum.
And then Mr. Zimmerman, or nay,
Richard Wagner himself, returned to
the footlights. One may not have seen
Wagner, but one knew irresistibly, as
ene knows of a Fran* Hals "Laughing
Bey." that the very substance and
rpirit of the man was before one. And
then the impersonator-bored one sat
up and decided that the matter was
not with Impersonations but with im
personators. With nothing but a wig
and a new eyebrow or two came Verdi.
Liszt. Metre.. Yon Suppe. Oscar Ham
merstein, each in his habit as he
lives or lived, and when one's mouth
was not open at the uncanny life
likeness of he Imitations it was
rtretching earward at their Attic
humor. Liszt's warts alone brought
Mr. Zimmerman to the paint-pot. He
drags off the wig and eyebrow after
each portrait to show only his own
round, blue-eyed, simple, rosy counte
nance. Remember that he has been
Icokinp. as Lawrence D'Orsay would
say, like a "boiled owl" as the dissi
pated Metra; sallow and sturdy as
Hammerstein; round and rubicund as
Vc-rdi: ivory-pale and aristocratically
time-scored as Liszt, and you will
tirderstand something of what Mr.
Z;mirÂ»rman does.
1 wondered if he knew any better
'han most geniuses how he did the
thing. He doesn't. I went to ask
him.
"It is the little things that make up
the big thing," he tri;i to explain of
h ; s methods. And Mr. Zimmerman
rtally thinks so. He really thinks that
the drooped eyelid, long inquisitive
thin and the thousand other little
iricks of appearance and manner that
-he has observed and reproduced make
up his startling portrait of Richard
Wagner. Xot any more, Hr. Zimmer
man, than ten syllables to a line, and
f< en lines autocratically rhymed
make up â  Petrarch sonnet!
I met the actor at the Orpheum in
the boardroom. He had a dog that said
"Hoy. -dye-do," and a cane. I hadn't
time for the dog. though Mr. Zimmer
r: an gave me almost two hours. He
could have given me two weeks and not
have repeated himself. Zimmerman on
Russia n conditions, on the American
vaudeville stage, as raconteur of stories
of the eomDosers he has metâ one is
simply in despair at the amount and
choice of material.
The cane must be mentioned though.
though it is only one of scores of royal
souvenirs that the actor has in his pos
session. It is a fat. silver affair, cov
ered with signatures in gold and royal
crests Such names as Yon Plehve.
Duke Sergius, Nikolai Mikaelovitchâ
the "wickedest man in Russia"â
to speak of Maxim Gorki's, crowd one
upon another. Th* cane is a reminder
from the Czar of Russia of the pleasure
he took in the Zimmerman Imitations
at Revoel on the 223 of June. 1902.
when he and his "brother of Germany"
were solemnly entertained.
"You noticed the big watch I took
out as Metra?" the actor asked me In
a by-the-way sort of manner.
I had.
"Duke Sergius gave me that." he
QUERY: CAN ARTISTS BE GENTLEMEN?
Aro the qualities that contribute to
â¢nake-up of artists incompatible
with â  gentleman?
can a man fill both roles with equal
success?
<>r is it incumbent upon a man of
artistic talent to exhibit the manners
of a Hottentot that he may "stand
out" among his fellows?
hi there extant a code of manners
and morals for the fellows who paint
and model?
In the discussion the women artists
are eliminated, because for the most
part they conform in a general way to
trMÂ» commandments of organised so
in manners and morals. And
when they don't â well, the world riseh
in its righteous wrath and denounces
them. And they sink â and die, and we
bo hear of them.
But with the men it's different. And
Pimply because some few men who
have been really great have been boors
and wore*, and lesser men have mis
taken thHr bad manners and loose
morals for evidences of genius. These
men were great in spite of their de
ficiencies, not because of them, and
immediately the lesser men proceed to
copy.
A studied carelessness in dress is
usually the first bad symptom, showing
itself in a disregard for the modes of
attire adopted by polite society.
Then come the boorish manners â the
conical attitude, the curt reply, the
BLANCHE PARTINGTON
told me â there are about two and a
half pounds of gold in it!
Then, first asking me if it "would in
terrupt me" if he smoked, Mr. Zim
merman talked about the unhappy
country to which all eyes are now di
rected. He spent much time there and
among his seven languages speaks
Russian fluently! I thought I could
understand why "Willy" saw so much
as I watched him at the tale. He is
so exactly like the next man you might
meet, so exactly the person that sees
nothing and doesn't care about it if he
does.
In his wide-open blue eyes there is
nothing of the lynx and his prevailing
expression is of the most good-natured
and rather vacuous simplicity. Yet to
this very simple person twenty min
utes suffice ro catch the very heart of
a man. I have no doubt whatever that
he could now give an imitation of Miss
Partington interviewing Mr. Zimmer
lran that would make her best ene
mies howl.
He sees everything. remembers
thing. As he saw Tsohaikowsky
sitting in a St. Petersburg Louvre,
skimming all the music from a hundred
differont journals, he saw the vodka
sodden proletariat, staggering into the
drinkshops for the vodka the Govern
ment gives them for 12 cents a pint:
statrp^ring out again on the sidewalks,
slapping out the cork by knocking the
bottom of the bottle with the ease of
long practice, adding another pint of
fire to their inward hell, and then,
men and women both, belittering the
sidewalks with their drunken carcasses.
"They used to make their own "vod
ka ' ' the raconteur added and sat
down again. He had been acting out
the whole grim scene.
"It cost them then 25 cents a pint
to make. The Government gives it to
them for 12 cents. Why? Why.
but for the purpose of degrading them,
preventing them from thinking."
For the Russian aristocrat Mr.
Zimmerman has even less respect, and
hf remarked that there was no mid
dle class in Russia only the foreign
element: every one else is either
a.= the dcvil â or as rich."
"The finest gentleman in the world
the Russian is when he is sober
WHEN HE IS SOBER." Zimmerman
repeated and emphasied. "Drunk,
there Is no pig so low." He added
some lively corroborative evidence, of
the insults to women on the streets,
of the winking thereat by the police
for a bribe, and such like. He added:
"You must see a man when he is
drunk or at cards to know him."
But all this was not Mr. Zimmer
man's art, and at length I got him
to talk about that. I asked how long
it took him to study the peculiarities
of his victims. He told me that what
h<=- could not see in twenty minutes he
would not see in twenty years.
"But. to act out the character," he
elaborated, "months, one year. I study.
B^for* the looking-glass I make him!
in my head I think him. until I can
not forget. It is. T tell you, not so
easy. And all the work I do is as
nothing until I make the character in
front of the people. I gif you my
unremoved cigarette, in short the clout,
th*> boor.
Then there are the artist chaps who
hold to a moral code quite distinct
from that held by the commonplace.
But happily this sect of sensualists
holds not many votaries in the local
coterie; but alas! alas! for the man
ners of some:
On the other hand, and by far the
greater number of the i-ainters in this
growing renter of American art are
sane and normal fellows, to whom art
is first â their personality afterward;
and who refuse to advertise their art
by freak dressing and freak manners
or morals.
And this is as it should be.
Your work firstâ yourself afterward.
And you cau bank upon it that If your
work is honest and worthy and sin
cere you'll not need to cease to hp a
gentleman in dress or manners to pro
claim the fact The world DOES rec

He has known all of the people
whom he imitates, and is full of anec
dotes concerning them. Nine months
ago he came to Oscar Hammerstein's
roof garden theater in New York. In
discussing his repertoire of imitations
Zimmerman asked if he should not do
Sousa to prove the life-likeness of the
other portraits. Hammerstein de
murred, said every one else did Souaa.
"What shall I do then?" the actor
asked.
"Do me." Hammerstein laughed
him away with. But in a few days
one Hammerstein walked in at one
door and another at the other, to the
utter confusion of the employes. Af
ter that Mr. Zimmerman imitated the
composer-manager, etc., etc., for the
laughter of thousands at his own the
ater. His little sketch for me of
Zimmerman answering two telephones
at once, dictating a letter, making oral
contracts with three other people and
composing an opera by the way, was
irresistible. Hammerstein com
pose an opera in two days for a bet,
he reminded me. Â«nd added that he is
a "lovely fellow."

little at the remembrance. "It was
in Odessa and I was dining with some
friends at a restaurant. There was, as
us,ual. a military band, and while the
leader was resting I went up to the
band and said to my friends, Tan go
ing to show you how leads.' They
laughfd a good deal and I decided to
use the imitation at my benefit. I
did, got into the leaders seat, and no
one knew until he came in that it
was not he!"

"I was then singing comic songs in
vaudeville." said Mr. Zimmerman. And
then it came out that the modest per
son before me, when he is at home, is
the composer and writer of some of the
most popular German .songs of the
day. "Hulda," "Emma," "Diogenes"
among them, and, further, their most
famous singer. "Comic song" means
a comic song over there. Political,
usually, and dealing with the latest
up-to-the-minute phase of political
life, they are wit and sense combined,
and sometimes a powerful engine in
the hands of one or the other parties.
"Diogenes." for example, sung in cos
tume and with a tub and a lamp â
representing the philosopher in his
much quoted search for the one hon
est man â was quoted in the Berlin
Parliament the day after its debut.
Our own lack of the kind of song is
one of the things Mr. Zimmerman has
noted.
"Are politics as bad over there as
they are here?" I asked.
That it's arresting, dashing, dra
matic, there is no doubt.
Tho girl is gowned in red â a stun
ning red, and the frock is eminently
smart.
I cannot help thinking as I look
upon the lines of that chic gown that
Mr. Greenbaum would make a fortune
as a dressmaker â but about the girl
and the picture.
Of a rich oHve skin, creamy in tone,
the color lie^ in the lips, full and lus
cious as a ripe cherry. The eyes are
Oriental, dark, languorous, passionate,
shaded by a sweep of dark lashes.
The hair Is o'ertopped with a smashing
black hat, famously becoming and
good millinery â another triumph in
feminine trumpery.
The gown is shown high in the
neck, concealing what must be a beau
tiful throat and shoulders. But the
omission i.Â« consistent with thr- muff
the fascinating little maid is coquetting
with, since muffs do not look well
with the evening frocks.
Mr. Greenbaum has painted his
lovely subject against a soft, dark blue
background, shading it into gentle
grays. The portrait, which is now at
his studio in the Columbia building, is
really a fascinating study and weli
worth a visit. It will be shown later
at the Spring Exhibition at Hopkins,
and if I mistake not it will make a
hit.
But these prophecies are bad â they
don't always make good. And then
what?
Nevertheless, I reiterate my
prophecy.
"You are fifty years quicker here
than we are," the actor replied.
"Well?"
"Well?" he laughed.
"That much more corruption here?"
"I think so."
Twenty-nine years ago his people
sent the Zimmerman youth to Amer
ica, honingr that his ignorance of the
languptr? would keep him off the stage.
But ins.cad it took him to the old Ger
man theater, the Thalia, where "Rich
ard Mansfield, Herr Conried and I were
long together. They couldn't do any
thing with Mansfield in those days,"
he humorously put it.
"No one thought anything of him: he
couldn't catch the way they wanted
him to speak â it's all experience, isn't
it, whatever talent there is?"
Why he was sure that Tschaikowsky
did not commit suicide, as is largely
believed; how the composer was wel

FOR THE ENSUING WEEK
The English Grand Opera Company is

full particulars of the bill will be found
under the music on this page.
The California is to the fore with a
new play. "Monsieur Beancaire," dram
atized from Booth Tarkington's well
known story of the name. Creston
Clarke brings the play, which was first
used by Richard Mansfield, and is said
to have a good company in his sup

The Alcazar also offers a new ro

cally before. It is a play in which Vir

will afford Miss Lillian Lawrence a
pretty opportunity to display her
charming art.
At the Grand Opera-house Kolb and
Dill are still attracting large audiences
of their admirers with "I O LV

"Faust," with HerschÂ°l Mayall in
the name role, will doubtless attract a
large contingent to the Central this

Clayton White and Marie Stuart will

week. These old favorites will this
time be seen in a new sketch, entitled
'Paris." Willy Zimmerman will be
among the most welcome of holdovers
and will impersonate this week Anton
Rubinstein. Brahms and Sousa among
his galaxy of conductors.
The comediettas presented by John
T. chick and Company are proving a
most attractive feature at the Chutes

week's comedy.
opera OF "la boheme"
Admirably given BY
...mr.. savage's com pax y
Had Mr. Savage's company begun
their engagement here with the spark
ling "Boheme" of this week, or with
the fine "Tannhauser." the reception
of this company of American singers
might have been more enthusiastic
than it has been. Both of these operas.
and particularly "La Boheme," were
admirably given. As Mimi and Ru
dolph Miss Jean Lane Brooks and
Reginald Roberts won notable personal
successes, and Mr. GofT as Marcel, Mr.
Boyle as Colline. Mr. Bennett as
Schaunard came excellently up to their
level. Nor d<ips one usually get so
good a Musetta from the vocal side as
Mi?s Newman's, Bat the distinguished
feature of the performance was, above
all. the sympathy ami security of its
ensemble. The singers were so well
rehearsed, so admirably sure of their
parts that they need-d hardly to
glance at the conductor, anl were
therefore fully free to sing and actÂ»uut
the gay and pathetic comedy. The
who?' tiling was instinct with a full
blooded and spirited bohemianism that
one would hardly have believed pos
sible to the American singers.
Parts of the Tannhauser, " again,
with Mr. Bcbenck'a debut into local
distinction a? the conductor, were al
most a? sood. Miss Rfennyaoa an.i Mr.
Wegener distinguished themselves both
vocally and dramatically as Elizabeth
and Tannhauser. and Mr. Deajie's
fram was a charmingly sympathetic
person. Again, however, it was the en
semble, particularly in the fine working
out of the double climax in the second
act. that was the crowning; charm of
the work. The opera will be given
again on Friday evening next, and
may confidently be recomsnended to the
Wagner-lover.

Quite the towering event of the
week was the Mardi Gras ball at the
Institute of Art.
Well, it's funny how different peo
ple gauge the atmosphere of *the ball.
"A beastly bore," says one. "The
time of my life," says another. . "A
nice quiet time," says a third.
And all these folk reflect their
own personality in their comments,
only they didn't know it.
They who were bored were the type
of folk one meets everywhere, who
stand by listlessly expecting some
thing to happen, and who never

dream of seeking to entertain them
selves or their friends. They are
usually selfish people who never get
out of themselves and never are
amused unless some one is using up
his brain and his energy to engage
their dull wits.
These people are of the type of the
kings of old, to whom the court jester
was more necessary than the chamber
lain.
Then there was the second class â
those who had "the time of their
lives."
These wore for the most part art
students, artists and those others pos
sessed of spontaneity enough to gen
erate the_ carnival spirit. Among
these were a pretty lot of debutants
and laddies â one of the sweet pre
rogatives of youth. It was this con
tingent saved the day. These were
the throwers of confetti and love la
riats and the real makers of the fun.
They .MADE fun, and in the making
they had their full share.
Therein, lies the axiom of enjoy
ment, and the same law holds good
all through the social relation â "Give
and ye shall receive."
Then the last class, those who had
"a nice quiet time," were those whose
years or oppressive dignity or their
satiety took the edge off their "car
nival spirit," but who none the less en
joyed the pageantry and the splendid
spectacle of moving color and charac
ter. Say what you will, it takes the
spirit of youth to enjoy a Mardi Gras â
the sDirit of youth or the spirit of the
Latin people, which is ever young.
One of the belles of the ball was Mrs.
Pedar Brugulere, v.ho as a butterfly
in white satin and spangles looked like
a French poster.
Others who were conspicuous for the
dash and spirit were Miss Edna Davis,
Miss Ethel Dean, Miss Virginia Jol
lifCe, Mrs. Milton Pray, Miss Helene
Robson, Mrs. Charles Krauthoff, Mrs.
George B. Carr, Miss Grace Llewellyn
Jones, Mrs. Gerrit Livingston Lansing,
Mrs. C. Frederick Kohl, Mrs. Truxtun
Beale. Mrs. John Sroufe Merrill, Miss
Ethel Hager, the Misses de Young and
Miss Pearl Landers.
The wedding of Miss Helen Bailey
and Mr. Mohr on Wednesday next is
quite the biggest affair on the cards
for next week. A stunning bride will
she make, as Miss Bailey is distinctly
a girl who understands the art of dress
and of wearing it.
It is said that Mr. Mohr is a royal
good fellow, fond of a good story and
that he is himself a good storyteller.
But that's to be expected of a New
York clubman â they bear such a smart
reputation!
However, our clubmen are pretty
good raconteurs.
Wouldn't a contest be interesting?

On the same day Miss Alice Brigham
will wed Lieutenant Clarence KempfT,
the service taking place in Trinity
Church.
The wedding is to be very simple
and Quiet, the bride to have but a
single attendant â which should seem to
be quite adequate for practical pur
poses.

The elaborate luncheon given at the
St. Francis by Mrs. Fernando Pflngst
on Tuesday last is still a matter of
tea-table chatter.
In details the affair quite surpassed
any luncheon given in San Francisco
this winter.
But it is said that Mrs. Pflngst has
a fashion of doing things in this de
lightful manner.

â¢
j Ji. 31. Grigiioux Makes Charge
j. for Second Time Against
!â â  Him of Threats to Kill
Howell Caradoc Rees, the eccentric
New Yorker, was arrested on Market |
street yesterday afternoon by Detec- I
tires Braig and Coleman. Although he
waa dressed in a quiet way, such as
would mislead the detectives, he was
recognized and taken to the City Prison
and booked on a charge of threats
against life.
The warrant for his arrest was sworn 'â 
out on February 23 by R. M. Gignoux,
a real estate agent in the Rialto build
ing. Rees told the detectives that as
soon as he read in. the evening papers
that the warrant had been issued he
left the city. He returned yesterday
morning and said he had intended to
give himself up to the police. He will
have to furnish bonds in $2000 to obtain
his release.
This is the second time he has been
a i rested on a charge preferred by Gig
noux. On the first occasion he was sent
to the insane ward at the Central
Emergency Hospital for examina- i
tion. The physicians who examined ;
him reported that he was sane. Gig- j
noux had no desire to press the charge ;
and Roes' friends smuggled him into ar
hack and had him taken to a sanita- â¢
rium at Belmont.
He made his escape from the sanita- \
rium and returned to the city. He made
statements that he would get even with
Gignoux for having him arrested.
Later he renewed his threats to kill
Gignoux. His antipathy toward Gig
noux arose from the fact that Gignoux
had wired to his people in New York
that they would better take him back
home.
F. E. BECK ELECTED ASSIGNEE
OF INSOLVENT FIRM
Creditors of Easton, Eldrldge & Co.
Meet and Bond Is Placed at
Ten Thousand Dollars.
Attorneys for the creditors of the
insolvent firm of Easton, Eldridge &
Co. appeared in Judge Kerrigans
court Friday afternoon and select
ed F. E. Beck assignee without oppo
sition. Some favored the selection of
a member of the firm of G. H. Umb
sen & Co. as assignee, believing thus
that the affairs of Easton, Eldridfcte &
Co. might be worked out to the best
advantage of the creditors.
About ten months ago the former
firm absorbed the rent collections of
Easton, Eldridge & Co., which was
not generally understood by the pub
lic. This was for a cash payment and
the assumption of all the obligations
due from Easton, Eldridge & Co. to
their landlords only, and all such ob
ligations have long been paid in full.
It was shown beyond question that the
transaction between the firms was en
tirely fair and regular in every re
spect and satisfactory to all con
cerned. I

resented were Anglo-Californian Bank.

DECKHAND HITS WATCHMAN
WHEN ACCUSED OF THEFT
Smugglers Do a Rushing Business on
Board Tag General Murkhnm
and Fight Results.
A lively scene resulted on the seawall
Friday night when C. Clark, head of a
band of watchmen who were guarding
the cargo of the steamer Oregon, was
assaulted by James Welch, a deckhand
who was caught In the act of smug
gling several kegs of anchovies on
board the fire tug General Markham.
Clark accused the deckhand of doing
crooked work and the latter responded
with a trunch to the Jaw that put Clark
out of commission.
The trouble occurred while a crowd
of spectators were viewing the smol
dering remains of the sulphur works
fire. G. Goldner, one of the watchmen,
saw a man pass a large keg to a com
panion on the General Markham. The
performance was repeated several
times, and finally Goldner told Clark,
who has charge of the watchmen.
Goldner later saw Welch and pointed
him out to Clark as the man he saw
pass the goods. Welch sailed into
Clark when the latter acused htm of
the crime. Clark will swear out war
rants charging Welch with theft and
battery.

The
baldheaded
row
Baldheaded men have l #
long been a standing
joke in every theater-
going community, but
nevertheless the loss of
the hair and the unsightly
condition which it imposes
upon the unfortunates who
compose the bakiheaded
row is often a source of
keen mortification.
The baldheaded row,
however, will speedily
become practically a thing
of the past, because the
more Coke Dandruff Cure is
used the more it proves
itself capable of positively
growing hair on bald heads,
a claim which was not
originally made by the
inventor. The formula, as
originally evolved, was
intended only to eradicate
and cure conditions of
dandruff and disease of
the scalp, but to the
surprise and delight of
constant users it quickly
demonstrated its ability to
restore the hair follicles to
their youthful vigor and
thereby produce a glossy
and luxuriant growth of
hair.
Thousands of people
in every rank and walk of
life have sent us grateful
testimonials that will attest
the truth of this. You don't
have to take our word or
theirs for it. If troubled
with dandruff, falling hair
or any scalp disease, try
it for yourself. We are
quite willing to abide by
the result. Your druggist
Will tell you the same
story. Ask him.

that he has misappropriated funds of

the amount was too much to be ex

THE SESSION ENDS.
THE Thirty-sixth Legislature has. concluded its labors. The ses
sion in the Senate was painfully interrupted by the bribery
scandal, but that incident was not permitted to stain the State's
escutcheon. The Senate promptly; in order, and manfully, took hold
â¢of the unclean subject, thoroughly investigated and administered
the punitive and admonitory discipline required. This action will
have a far reaching effect. It will make constituencies more careful
in the selection of their representatives, and will exercise a whole
some restraint upon any that are tempted to make merchandise of
their position. The prompt discharge of an unpleasant duty by the
Senate far offsets the effect of the offense which it punished, and
-^the State feels no loss of prestige but rather a great gain in public
morals.
The Legislature dealt with some large matters. Finding the
metrical reform of our system of taxation to require a very
deliberate investigation, it passed that much needed action on to a
commission, which is to co-operate with a recognized authority in
scientific taxation. The commission will doubtless consult in that
f capacity Professor Plehn of the university, who has proved himself
a most useful and beneficial citizen, by the information upon such
subjects that he has given to the people. Indeed it may be truly
said that he created that public opinion throughout the State which
brought this issue up to the Legislature. 0 ' â¢ X
We have for some time observed that in Ohio, Illinois and
other Eastern States where tax reform is an issue Professor Plehn
is quoted in the press and in Legislative discussions as the highest
American authority* on that subject. The State is fortunate in
having him at hand and in being able to secure his service and
advice. The Call has urged this tax reform from the beginning, and
is glad to promise its co-operation in the work until it is accom
plished.
The Legislature passed the river reclamation bill in the form
accepted by the land owners and the Sacramento Valley Develop
ment Association. This is a good beginning. It co-ordinates the
force and influence of all the interests concerned, and gives our
members of Congress a splendid backing in their effort to secure
Federal co-operation.
One of the evils of our system of paying taxes, is found to be
ihe long lapse of time between the payment of taxes into the treas
ury and their payment out for public purpose, to return again into
circulation. This method keeps locked up and out of circula
tion a great many millions of dollars at a time when the
money should be in circulation and serving the needs of business.
The constitution requires that this system be followed, by forbidding
the deposit in banks of the public funds, State, county and municipal.
At the time the constitution was adopted there was abroad a 'pre
judice against financial institutions, and the fundamental law was
made, in effect, to legislate against them by reflecting that prejudice.
The constitutional provision was framed, it is feared, more with a
desire to injure the banks than to benefit the people, or make the
public funds 'secure.
The Legislature now proposes and submits an amendment to the
constitution permitting what it now forbids, by authorizing the de
posit in banks of all public funds, under proper safeguards. â This
instead of endangering the public money will make it more secure
than now. We have had many sad instances, from the State down
to town treasuries, of the honesty of public custodians finally yield
ing to the temptation of opportunity to take for their own use the
Bmoney8 money of the people lying idle in the public vaults. Such temptation
is removed when the funds are daily deposited under safe security
in banks, where they can re-enter circulation and continue their func
tion of serving the purposes of business, and can always be had when
The Legislature responded to the public demand for forestry
legislation on the lines suggested by the Water and Forests Associa
tion. A Commission of Forestry is created, to be composed of ex
perts, and hereafter we may expect preventive measures to stop the
S fearful destruction of our forests by fire. The Ypsemite was re
ceded to the Federal Government. This was a measure promoted by
the State Board of Trade, and it has an important relation to for
estry. The State, relieved of the cost of administering the Yosemite,
can now divert the large sums required for that purpose to the care
ami development of the State redwood park in the "Big Basin. This
is the finest forest park in the world, and when made more readily
accessible will be a scenic asset of San Francisco of first importance.
Xo forest exceeds it in soft sylvan beauty, nor in the 'majesty and
magnitude of its trees. It will deserve the fostering care of the
State.
Of the 2000 bills introduced in the two houses, some passed that
might have died, usefully, on the files. One of these is the bill com
pelling counties to pay a minimum of $3 per day for unskilled labor
on public roads. It is doubtful policy to legislate for that purpose."
As well might the counties be compelled to pay a statutory price for
road material. The people want good roads and the taxpayers want
economy. This legislation is not in the interest of either.
On the whole, however, the State is able to join heartily in the
Governor's congratulation of the Legislature upon the average ex
cellence and wisdom of its work.
JAPAN IN COMMERCE.
IN Europe and in some parts of this country the tocsin is being
nde<i in the matter of the commercial war that Japan will
make upon the rest of tjhe world after the war is over. Japan is
deficient in the raw materials that enter into commerce. Her tillable
area is limited, possibly nst exceeding that of California, and with
much less variety and value of resources. The position of Tapan is,
and will be. much like that of the British Isles. She must import
raw material to support any considerable variety of manufactories
and ultimately must seek abroad the food of her people. She will
develop many industries now unknown on her soil, but they will
only serve to increase the wants of her people and increase their
power of exchange.
Our Pacific Coast would profit exceedingly if Japan would
achieve the position of the British Isles, by making the consuming
: of her people as great. This coast would supply the wants
of Japan, and San Francisco would become the point of exchange.
Japan in her turn may come to handle the exchanges with Eastern
A via. and would in that respect hold the same position as England
does. The fear that Japan will injure the rest of the world by the
development of her industrial power has no foundation in economics.
Already the wants of her people have been increased, though their
awakening was less than fifty years ago. When Perry opened that
empire to the world he found a people satisfied with a low scale of
wants and supplying these themselves. By the year 1900 their wants
had so enlarged that the foreign trade of Japan amounted to $250,
070.000. and exceeded that of Denmark. Norway or Sweden, and
was one-half as great as that of Russia.
Now, the question is, was that foreign trade of Japan an injury
benefit to the commercial world? If a benefit, to what volume
it attain to become an injury? When Perry opened that empire
to the world was it expected that the people would go on supplying
all of their own wants, or was the opening of the country in the in*
t crest of the world's commerce?
Jt seems that these questions answer themselves. Japan's trade
is an addition to the world's commerce and adds to the profits of the
industrial nations. When it reaches $500,000,000 it will be twice as
beneficial to the world as it is now, and if it reach the volume of
the trade of the British Isles its beneficent influence will be felt by
oerv commercial nation.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY. MARCH 12. 1905.
THE UNEQUALED NEWS SERVICE OF THE CALL
WITH its unsurpassed special telegraphic and cable arrangements, with trained correspondents
in every city, village and hamlet in this Western country, as well as in all the principal Eastern
news centers and abroad, together with the best equipped local news-gathering force ever or
ganized by any Western newspaper, The Call publishes ALL THE NEWS and places special
emphasis on the quality and general high standard of the news it prints. This is a big claim. It is
not braggadocio â it can be substantiated in every particular, and a careful inspection of The Call as
it appears before its readers and the general public daily is earnestly urged in order that a full realization
of the force of our claims may be brought directly home to the reading public.
This paper claims a superior news-gathering service, and is prepared to justify such claims to
the entire .satisfaction of a!l who may be interested in arriving at the actual truth of this broad assertion.
To this end we invite the public to a critical examination of the paper, its general appearance and
make-up; to our news-gathering facilities; to a thorough inspection of our immense plant and the won
derful workings of its expert help, both literary and mechanical. When The Call is delivered every
morning punctually and without a moment's delay to its thousands of readers, at an hour when most
beings are awakening from a night's slumber, do these readers fully realize that the world's news they
peruse leisurely over their coffee has been gathered from all parts of the globe by one of the most
thorough- and expert news-gathering forces on earth in the comparatively short space of eight hours and
placed before them in the most readable and attractive manner known to the journalistic craft?
The Call claims unqualifiedly the best news-gathering service, of any newspaper published
west of the Rocky Mountains and excelled by few in the United States. The Call presents ALL the
news of the day in an entirely fair and impartial manner â its reports are unbiased and uncontrolled by
any consideration. The Call publishes- every iota of the day's news. It may happen in Asia. Africa,
Europe, Australia, in the East or at our very door â you will rind it in The Call. Is its already large and
rapidly growing circulation and business patronage to be marveled at? The people appreciate The Call.
The Call will continue to merit such appreciation.
YOUNG WIVES NEED
MUCH TACT.
Refined Illusion Constitutes at Least One-Half of
Love's Enchantment.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
IT is one of the contradictions of
masculine nature that those fem
inine qualities which captivate a
man in the first place are not
necessarily the ones which keep his
love once they have gained it. The de
light of the eyes may .charm him as a
lover, yet bore him as a husband, if
my lady's pretty head is empty, and
her pretty hands are always idle, and
her pretty ears are always pricked for
compliments.
A man may lose his heart to a girl
because she flirts attractively, wears
$200 gowns, or is the object of other
men's attentions; but often after he
has married her he expects her to lay
aside the foolishness that caught him,
and cultivate the common, inexpensive
household virtues. As one wiseacre has
remarked: "Men fall in love with girls
at play â hut there is nothing so likely
to keep them in love as to see girls at
work."
Women grasp this fact by intuition.
As soon as a girl is engaged she turns
her attention from the art of making
fudge's, and of concocting cold cream
for her complexion, according to the
latest beauty recipe, and goes to cook
ing school to don a bewitching cap and
apron, and snowy oversleeves, and to
learr. how to boil water and potatoes,
to scramble eggs and make creamed
oysters. With pride she shows her
fiance the hat that she has "trimmed,"
by sticking an ostrich plume on the
side of a ready-made turban. And
when he comes to call on week day
evenings he finds her bending demurely
over a 50-cent handkerchief, on the
edge of which she is sewing some imi
tation Valenciennes lace which was a
great bargain at 12% cents a yard.
She knows, with a shrewdness that
resembles guile, that her lover no
longer cares to have her coquette with
him and keep him on the jump. He's
had enough of that for a while. It was
hard work, and he is ready for a rest
and a foretaste of the quiet pleasures
of domestic bliss.
Considered in the aggregate, unmar
ried women are astonishingly wise
about managing men. I suppose it is
because they have to make a regular
business of itâ there is so much com
petition. But as soon as one of them
gets a monopoly of a man's affections
she begins to take things easy and to
believe in the efficacy of fate, with all
the superstitious laziness of an ori
ental true believer.
THE KISS.
LAST night 1 had to go to' bed
All by myself, my mother said,
'Cause I'd been naughty all day through.
She wouldn't kiss me good-night, too.
I didn't want to let her know
How much I cared 'bout that, and so
I dropped my clothes right en the floorâ
A thing I never did beforeâ
And put each stocking in a shoe â
She just hates thatâ and didn't do
My hair, or wash my face, or brush
My teeth, and left things in a sqush
AH 'round the room; and then 1 took
Her picture, and my fairy-book
She gave me on my last birthday
In June, and hid 'em both away.
1 put my father's picture right
Up in the middle of the light,
To show 'em just the way I feel,
Cause he said, "Kiss the child, Lucille,
Don't let her go to bed like this
Without your usual good-night kiss."
But she Just shook her head and turned
Her back, and then my eyes they burned
Like fire. . . . It's been a horrid day. . . .
And then, of course, I didn't say
My prayers at all, but went to bed
And wished and wished that I was dead.
Well, I don't know just how it was,
For Id been half-way sleeping, 'cause
I was so 'pletely tired outâ
When I heard something move about
So quiet, and the next I knew
The door moved back and she came through
And DUt her arm around me so,
And Raid, a-whispering very low,
"My poor, dear child," and was so sad.
And kissed me twice â My! I was glad.

There is one truth in particular that
many cease to heed â a truth which in
girlhood they dared not once forget â
that familiarity breeds contempt, and
that it is refined illusion which consti
tutes at least half of love's enchant
ment. Theie is no magic in a wedding
ring which so hypnotizes a man that
he is pleased lo see his wife's face all
smeared with grease for sunburn, or
v.ith lemon jui< c for freckles. Once a
woman told me, with a belated sense
of humor, that her honeymoon was
spoiled by her husband's horror at her
curl-papers and by her offended pride
at his peremptory command. "Don't
you ever let me see you wear those
things again."
When a woman has been married a
while she realizes the necessity of tact.
She also learns that love does not re
main an ethereal thing; it is a genuine
rf-ality, a matter of common sense and
mutual respect.

NEGLECTED CHILDREN
OF A NEGLECTED
ISLAND.
The benefit to us from Guam may be
chimerical, or purely strategical at any
rate: but our duty to Guam in return
is clearly denned in what Guam is and
ought to be, says Willard French in
Eooklovers' Magazine. For seven
years oui flag has floated there â quite
time enough to have begun. We have
established a naval station. The com
mander is Governor of Guam. The
Governor is expected to adjust internal
matters as bett he can. with such
means as he can secure from the peo
ple. There are 11,000 of those people,
more a part of fiuam than the strat
egic harbor; and. rightly viewed, all
of our interests there are vitally Inter
uoven with theirs. They are neither
heathens nor barbarians. Whatever
may be said of Spain's colonial mis
management, she did what no other
nation has yet done â ?he thoroughly
Christianized her colonies.
There are 4000 children on the island.
It was never self-supporting under
Spain. Our Government has always
known that ihp utmost possible reve
nue was exhausted long before it could
touch a school: but it has left those
4000 children at Guam for these seven
yean without a pennyworth of pro
vision for their education â nrÂ» teach
ers, no supplies, no funds, no schools.
When Captain Schroeder was Gov
ernor he dreamed out a possibility be
tween economy and increased "taxes,
secured American teachers. opened
schools and enrolled 300. Then re
sources failed and he sent the teach
ers back. Lieutenant Safford. whilf
Vice Governor, was a mest earnest
friend of the Chamoros. He opened
and taught an evening school himself.
Commander Dyer, the present Gov
ernor, has made the most successful ef
fort, through the assistance of his en
thusiastic and cultivated wife, who
drew the American ladies on the island
into a free educational scheme. Th
brownies were so eager that place?
were as hard to find as teachers and
supplies; sn the age limit was reduced
till only tots from 7 to 12 were admit
ted. Still they came, crowding: and
now only boys are taken in the morn
ing and cirls in the afternoon.
In Mindanao the Government builds
schoolhouse and teachers' house, finds
teacher and supplies and sends into
highways and hedges, begging little
Moros to come in. while General Wood
is still obliged to improve the big
Moros by burying them: and the biÂ«
Moros â why, they would as soon kill
a teacher as any one else. We have
gone quite mad over education in the
Philippints and noj quite mad enough
over Guam.
SACRAMENTO UNION'S
INDUSTRIAL EDITION
In line with the work which it has
been consistently following for years,
the Sacramento Union on March 5 is
sued a thirty-eight page paper in three
sections, two of which were devoted to
the industrial development of the Sac
ramento Valley and tributary counties.
The work is in every respect fully up
to the reputation of that journal for
enterprise and execution.
The great fertile valley is treated
first as a whole and then the several
counties thereof as well as those ad
jacent and related thereto geographic
ally and commercially are given de
tailed notice and several pages describe
the many and varied attractions of the
capital city.
Many of the articles are by special
writers. Altogether the work is not
only a credit to its projectors â¢ and
producers, but to the whole region of
which it speaks.

INA WRIGHT HANSON
("Elbert," she repeated, "you j

IT was sunny where we sat at Sutro
Heights, between the white statues
of Prometheus and Femme au Ser
pent. At our left stretched a
smooth, red road.
"The road o? love, and it leads to
paradise," I remarked.
Pauline was silent. Her dreamy eyes
gazed beyond the little waves lagging
in toward shore, out to the bank of fog
which circled the waters as if to shut
us two. there in the sunshine, away
from the whole world. My glance lin
gered on Pauline's rippling brown hair,
on her straight little nose, on her
mouth: and 1 gave one long sigh of
content.
"â¢Pauline," I said, "will you mar
ry me?"
"No," she answered.
Her tone was caressing, but it held
uncompromising firmness. The fog
was coming: closer in.
"Why?"
Pauline turned her gray eyes from
tlie ocean to me.
' 'One thin? Thou lackcst." she quoted
softly. â¢â¦Jo sell what th<>u hast and

"I have more money than I know

"I really mean it."

at the end of that time I left her look
ing at the ocean, h^r eyes wet. but her

af me inquiringly as I strode past her
auto car, which had brought us both.
I jammed my hat down viciously and
started along the red road, but it no
longer led to paradise. It was no "road

anywhere.

It's amazing what a good night s
sleep will do for a man. Next morn- 1
ing I had an interview with my law- '
yer. lc was tedious, and somewhat
embarrassing, as I had to explain some '
things I should have preferred to keep \
to myself. It was over at last and I j
sought Pauline.
I found her in the rose garden, writ
ing rapidly. When she saw me she
sprang up, scattering her papers on
(he grass. She smiled at me tearfully.
"I discovered that I couldn't live
without you." I said, taking her into
my arms. "I could have given away a
dozen fortunes rather than lose you."
I felt her start.
"Given away, Elbert," she repeated.
"You haven't given awayâ"
"Every cent," I cried gaily, leading
her to a seat. 'Just got the business

Her lips were quivering again, so I
said hastily:
"Well, sweetheart, go DUt on rour
plainest gown, as befits a poor man s
bride, and we will go at efnee to the
parsonage."
I laughed when she came back. Her
"plainest gown" was simple and white,
but probably coat as much as I could
earn pn the ranch in a year.
'The minister lent me the money
for the license, and haa promised to
wait till I get my first month's waÂ«cs

we walked along.
Pauline's face flushed, and she looked
up piteously.

"You will get me a ring as soon at

a charming assumption of disrnitv.
"Indeed, we shall not. W> will gn

That evening as we sat in the

"Wo are going to the count n

' 'You see. Elbert did just what I did â

Wasn't it a funny coincidence?"
' 'Very." said the lawyer dryly.
My wife folded and unfolded her

"And you expect to enjoy drudgery
instead of luxury*, do you?" he ask~<l
with a suspicion of a growl.
"It isn't a matter of liking," Pauline
answered quietly. "Elbert did it be

neither of us thought of the other's

'I see. Would it disappoint you

Pauline gasped.
"I thought you'd be sorry, so I mad

THE PIANO'S LOOKS.
The modern piano is a disgrace, so
far as looks are concerned, says a
writer in the February Country Life in
America. There is no excuse for the
manufacturer, as the public would be
more than glad to get a decent looking
instrument. These designs have been
so bad that many who can afford it
have had special cases designed by able
furniture designers' and architects.
Within the last few years some of thÂ«
makers of upright pianos have turned
out some very creditable designs, bu'
the grand seems to hang just where it
has been for years, an ugly, clumsy
monstrosityâ a jarring note wherever
it goes. Let us hope that the day Is
not far distant when one can look upon
his piano as a decorative feature in hi*
home, and not as an eyesore, tolerated
only for the sake of the sweetness it
contains.

ANGELS DISTRICT HAS FINE
OUTLOOK FOR MINING
Hundreds of Stamps Crash
Ores That Bear Gold.
Much Work Is in Progress Near the
Old Town of Shasta.
Great mining activity in Calaveras
County in the neighborhood of Angels
ig expected during the present year.
The outlook is declared to be bright
er than at any precedipg time in years.
S- vf-ral large deals are reported by the
Angels Record to be progressing satis
factorily and all the power needed to
work the mines of Calaveras and Tuol
umne counties has been secured and
will soon be available for use. Prop
erties that have been idle for some
time are about to be worked again.
The opening of the Sultana mine has
been determined on. The mine has
been closed some months. Of opera
tions in the Angels district the Angels
Record says, in part:
At the Benson mine everything is in good
shaj>e. with the ten-ftamii mill running day
and night. The Essex Consolidated is finding
stood rock. Ten stamps arc working:. In a
few wtfke forty will he dropping. At the
Melones sixty stamps are dropping steadily,
v.hile the work of erecting an additional thirty
icreoMng. ThlÂ» mine Is a proposition <>f
bulidlng stamps, as the entire property can
be run through the mill at a good profit. At
the Etna King the shaft is now at a depth
of ninety-two feet and sinking will be oon
tlrued until 200 feet i* reached. It is reported
that work will be commenced in the Oriole
within a short time. Home new property hav
ing b<^n secured, to which a drift will be run
fr % m the main shaft. An effort Is being made
to start up the Maltman. adjoining the Sul
tana. As yet nothing definite has been de
cided upon. At the Black Oak te-n men are
cross-cutting. At the Utlca everything is run
ning aa usual. Of late it has been rumored
that a shaft is to be put down Just adjoining
Sequoia Park on the north, to connect with
Ike old shaft at the Madison, but as yet no
crfirmation of the rumor can be had. ThÂ«
Puchesg mine near Valleclto has been Incor
porated under the name ot the Stanislaus Min
ing Company of Indianapolis. A ten-stamp
mill is on the mine.
RUMOR IS CONTRADICTED.
A rumor concerning the closing of
the Idaho-Maryland mine in Nevada
County is contradicted by the Nevada
City Transcript, which makes the fol
lowing statement:
The cause of the rumor lay in the discharge
of some men who had been employed on the
repair* to the mill. Twenty stamps have
been thoroughly overhauled and the work was
completed recently. These belnj deemed all
that are necessary for the immediate purposes
of the company the men engaged in the work
were laid off. The remaining- twenty stamps
will be overhauled as their services are re
quired. The work of unwaterlng will bÂ» con
tinued without abatement and all the miners
wiil be retained as before. While some
trouble has been experienced with the pump
in the old shaft that catches water from the
Â£>ureka this has now been nearly overcome
through the aid of steam pumps and the de
fect will soon be remedied. Considerable work
U being done in reopening the 400 level besides
the work of pumping out the shaft, for the
purpose of ascertaining the condition of the
mine at that particular point.
The operations at Kennett at the
Mammoth mine are reported by the
Redding Free Press to be in full head
way. The compressors are in and the
machine drills have been started. Ore
bins will be constructed this month.
The survey of the mine has been com
pleted. The mine will be run with elec
tric power.
Regarding the Nevada mining camps
the Los Angeles Times says:
While Angelenos are going in large numbers
Into Johnnie, Bullfrog ana other Nevada dis
tricts, mining men arriving here report a
heavy influx of miners, prospectors and busi
ness men frqpi the north. Many are coming
via the Salt Lake from Utah and Colorado. go-
Ing into the camps via Las Vegas or Good
ijiringi. â¢ Numbers of Goldfield and Tonopah
men, after having established themselves In
the northern districts, are prospecting In the
new fields.
A representative of a Lob Angeles grocery
firm has Just returned from an extensive trip
through Sandy, Johnnie and Bullfrog and re
ports having taken orders for enormous sup
plies that will be sant out at once. He was
the first drummer that had ever visited somo
of the camps while others had been worked by
San Franciscans.
An effort is being â made by some of those
Interested to have the wagon road from Good
springs on the Salt Lake line to the Sandy and
Johnnie districts Improved, so as to bring about
the hauling of freight by this route. Instead
of the Ivanpah road. It in said that the Bait
Lake management is encouraging the move- !
m*nt, so that it may get the great trade now
going from Los Angeles via the Santa Fe. The
distance via Goodspringi Is twenty-one mIK-s
to Sandy and thirty-five miles from Ivanpah,
but the Intervening mountains and the condi
tion of tha road make the Ivanpah route the
more desirable at present. The effect of the
proposed action mar be to hasten the now
likely building of the Santa Fe into the terri
tory aa the means of retaining Its business.
Colonel A. B. Browne, the Santa Fe engi
neer, who has been examining the Nevada dis
tricts, was In the city for a few hours on
Thursday and left that night for Chicago,
where he is expected to submit a full report
to the highest officials of the railroad com
pany, which Is likely to nave a great effect
upon the future of this section.
The Nevada- Keystone's mill at Sandy, that
has been shut down since September, is to be
started up at once.
The De Lamar-Baumberger mine, located
about seventy-five miles northeast of Johnnie,
in Lincoln County, near the Salt Lake line, is
reported to be operating steadily, despite the
handicap it has been under In the past by lack
of transportation. The ore is said to run

The Yreka Journay says that the re
cent weather has had a bad effect on
j the mining industry in Slskiyou
| County, as the water ' supply is insuf
ficient to continue hydraulic and pla
cer mining. The Journal says:
j With more rain or snow and warmer weath
, *r. a good supply may be- furnished. The win-
I ter so far ha? been exceedingly mild In the
' way of storms, with but little snow on the
; mountain tops and not much rain In the val

â¢but little more can be expected* making the
j rainfall not likely to- reach 'more than half the
j limit of last year. Up to this date only a lit
â  tle more than twelve Inches of moisture has
j visited us. I while last year for the same time
! we had twenty-two inches and about thirty
! inches to April 1. 'â ']. * .
' A' rich quartz ledge has lately been discov
! ered on the lower Klamath. near Happy
I <""amn. which causes simp excitement In that
j neighborhood, and has induced many to start
j out prospecting. The miners believe there
j will be something; doing in that section this
: summer In the way of quartz mining, as well
jas In hydraulic and placer mining. JamlnAn
& Co.. now working the McKlnley mining
! property in the vicinity of Sucker Creek, in
Humbug district, are working steadily on the
' Flag mine of the group, with good prospects,
i as the development progresses.
In the old mining country around
Shasta, so says the Shasta Courier, a
| great deal of activity characterizes the
i situation. That paper says:
The ric^h strike at the Navajo or old White
! Oak mine at Lower Springs more than holds
1 out.
The Wiser brothers, farther south, have a
property that has produced thousands and the
indications show that there is ple-nty of good
ore in the hill. To the north Cummins, , Noff
slnger & Johnson are developing a great prop
i erty in the Dobrowsky mine. The road leading
to the property is being graded on the steep
pulls. A mill will soon b* erected on the
ledge.
Shasta will feel the benefit of these opera
tions and discoveries, as they are located near
the town and partly adjoin the town limits.
The Copper Crest mine, near Red
ding, reports the Redding Free Press,
has a new owner. George C. Graves
and M. E. Dittmar have sold to I. O.

' the Mammoth mine. The property
includes forty acres.
AMADOU MAKES DISCOVERY.
Asbestos has been discovered in the
Jackson Valley in Amador County on
the ranch of the Ellis brothers. Cop
per ores have also been recently
found In the same valley. r The Ama
dor Ledger says regarding the copper
i discoveries:
! # W. M. Nichols has camples of copper ore
j taken from surface cropplngs In Jackson Val
i ley, opposite the " Cami>o Seco copper mines.
' The samples Include several points along the
ledge. Experts who have examined the rock
on the ground say the prospects are fully as
good as. were the surface indications at the
thriving mining camp on the Calaveras side
of the river. The outcropping* ate from twenty
to thirty feet wide In places, and only three
miles Intervene In a direct line from Campo
fieco, the ledge being plainly traceable the en
tire distance. No assay has been made of the
ore. The Campo Seco mines employ about 100
men. The ore carries not only copper, but
gold and silver, the yield of the latter metals
being sufficient to pay all expenses, the yield
in copper being clear profit. Whether the ledge
on the Amador side is equally Impregnated
with gold and silver can be ascertained only
by a careful survey: *â : â¢ .-. ,
Development work has been start
ed . at the Inkmarque mines near

ings says that the shaft will be sunk

the North Star property.
In Tuolumne County several mining
matters are reported by the Mother
Lode Banner, among the more im
portant being the plans pending for
the reopening of the John Royal mine.
The Banner reports that ten tons of
ore from one of the waste dumps near
Jackass Hill were recently put
through a mill and yielded $110. The
SoulÃby mill has been closed and the

GREAT PROBLEM
IS NOW SOLVED
Parasite That Saves Apple
Proves Ability to Round
Out Its Chain of Life
HATCHES IN CAPTIVITY
Event Demonstrates That
Benefit Developed Will
Be of Permanent Sort
There is joy in the offices of the Hor
ticultural Commission in this city for
the reason that a groat problem of
transcending importance to apple
growers throughout the United States,
and particularly in California, has
been solved. Yesterday a codlln moth
parasite emerged from thÂ«? darkness
in which it was hatched in a glass jar
in the Ferry building and so the fact
was finally and conclusively demon
strated that the parasite will multiply
indefinitely in California even under
such adverse circumstances as the en
vironment of a glass jar in a closed
room. In the open air the proposition
is easier than it has been in the Hor
ticultural Commissioner's domain.
Some months ago George Compere
discovered in Southern Europe the
coldin moth parasite and, some time
later, large quantities of the parasite
in the grub stage of existence were
sent by Compere to the Horticultural
Commissioner of California. They were
nursed carefully and rJfj less carefully
observed by Messrs. Ehrhorn and
Carnes in the fruit pest quarantine
station in this city. When the grubs
developed orchards in all sections of
the State were outfitted with colonies
of active parasites, that seemed never
to get tired or to desire to rest while
the sun shone. But still there was a
problem, which was whether the entire
chain of existence of the parasite could
be perfected in this country. The grubs
were imported and so life began
abroad.
With the answer goes the absolute
assuranr c that now the parasite has
positively come to stay in California
permanently and the great benefits
that it is to confer will go on without
interruption at all seasons and without
regard to temperature, for the parasite
will live wherever apples will ripen.
No greater piece of information gauged
by its ultimate results to a large in
dustry and to its relation to the pros
perity of an army of apple growers has
been originated in California in many
years.

SPOUSE HELPS
ENGLISH LORD
OF ADMIRALTY
Lee's American Wife
Assists Him in
His Work.
Special Cable to The Call.
LONDON, March 11.â Arthur Lee, |
M. P., the Civil Lord of the Admiralty, I
whose recent speech concerning
changes in England's naval policy
stirred up such a rumpus in Germany,
shares with Lord Donoughmore the
reputation of being one of the hardest
working and most painstaking mem
bers of the present Government. He
makes no secret of the fact that he
owes much of his success to his clever
American wife. ,
When she does not accompany him
to* his office in the morning she in
variably drives round in her smart â 
motor about noon and remains with
him for the remainder of his office
hours. She conducts all his private
correspondence and works a typewrit
er with the facility of an expert. She
has lately been adding stenography to
her other qualifications with the view
of rendering further assistance to her
husband.
When she appears at the Admiralty
offices in Whitehall the word is passed
round among the permanent officials
that the "governor's private secretary"
has arrived. This description is not
literally correct, because the civil lord
has a private secretary allotted to him
by the Government, but that she does
much work in her husband's office is
within the knowledge of every clerk
la the department. When she is not at
his side in Whitehall she is generally
at home in Chesterfield Gardens ham
mering away at her typewriter on his
private correspondence, so as to leave
him the utmost freedom for his official
work.
Among the Admiralty men he is
looked upon as a most exacting and
methodical chief, and in t^iis respect
he has no equal in the Government
since Joseph Chamberlain left the
Colonial Office. He is, however, a fa
vorite, because his subordinates ac

COURT INJURES PRIDE
OF TELEPHONE GIRLS
Decided in France That They Cannot
Be Classed as State
Officials.
PARIS, March 11.â The decision of
the Supreme Court refusing to recog
nize telephone girls as state officials
is a great blow to feminine pride. The
Paris service is bad enough at present,
but worse is expected to follow this de
privation of an official status and the
assimilating of the girls to ordinary
commercial employes.
The public, nevertheless, is jubilant,
as no prosecution for insulting state
servants is possible. In the future, so
far as the telephone service is concern
ed, it is believed that the high stand
ard of efficiency supposed to exist in
America will now be attainable here.
To Campaign in an Auto.
LONDON, March 11.â The Countess
of Warwick is about to start on a long
automobile tour over the country to
assist the labor cause by visiting every
constituency where there Is a labor

â¦ure of Lady Warwick's task may be
judged from the fact that she will visit
some fifty towns throughout England,
Scotland and Ireland.

MARKET TAKES
SODDEN SPORT
Rumored Increase of Divi
dends on Railroad Shares
Stimulates Speculators
LIVELY BUSINESS WEEK
Bank Clearings Through
out the Country Are Main
tained at a Record Level
NEW YORK, March 11.â Yesterday's
j sudden spurt of seven points in Ches
[ apeake and Ohio led to a much excited
conjecture as to the cause and was the
stimulating influence in to-day's stock
market. Suppositions as to the basis
â¢ for the movement were conflicting and
various. Yesterday's rumor of an in
tended increase in the dividend to 4
! per cent was a continuing factor and
I gave rise to the general theory of a
i policy of more liberal dividend dis
, bursements on the part of the railroad
i companies under the Pennsylvania
| domination. Th Ls report was supple
| mented by a story of a plan to form
i a new railroad system with an outlet
I from the Middle West to the Chesa
j peake and Ohio's Atlantic terminus.
I The Pacifies, Reading, Canadian group
j the metal stocks and some others
I which have been prominent in the
I week's speculation were heavy
throughout. The profit-taking in them
affected sentiment and increased the
disposition to realize toward the last,
I so that the closing, was decidedly ir
regular and with net changes mixed in
spite of a great show of strength dur
i ing the session.
Total sales of bonds, par value, $2,
395.000.
The action of the stock market of
| the early part of the week was a dls
: appointment to the speculative enthu
siasts, but the demand revived with
â  the progress of the week and there was
a notable advance in special stocks,
; which had a strengthening effect on
' the whole list. The early hesitation
i was due in no small part to the fail
ure of the transcontinental railroad
stocks to respond to the settlement of
; the dissolution plan of the Northern
Securities Company, which results
[ from the Supreme Court decision of
Monday. The failure of this group to
leap upward on the Northern Secur
ities decision was therefore more fa
vorably interpreted.
The spirit of skepticism was in
creased by the admitted miscarriage of
the plans for a combination of the
Southern iron companies, which had
caused a furious speculation In these
stocks. This epiÃode impressed on
many the conviction that they had
I been overcredulous in accepting un
warranted assertions and shook their
belief in other stories which had in
duced them to buy stocks. Another
; unsettling influence was the transit
I strike. Besides its sentimental effect
i it was a factor in obstructing business
at the Stock Exchange.
Decreases in grosg earnings of some
of the railroads reporting for the
fourth week of February were regard
ed as significant, though railroad traf
fic officials reported freight offerings in
such abundance that its receipts were
limited only by the overtaxed car fa
cilities. Business reports and pros
pects have been brilliant, and bank
clearings throughout the country are
maintained at a record level.
Bonds have moved narrowly, but in
sympathy with stocks. United States
2s advanced % per cent on call during
the week.

PARIS, March 11.â At its opening the
political week was marked by the suc
cess of the Nationalist candidate in the
department of the Sarthe, whose elec
tors had t" choose a deputy in place
of Baron d'Estournelles ac Constant,
who had been elected Senator. A land
ed proprietor of the district named
D'Aubigny was chosen.
In the Chamber of Deputies, in the
debate on the naval appropriations, Ad- :
miral Bienaine. who succeeded Syve
ton, made his debut in a speech in i
which he showed spite against Camille
PellPtan, the former Minister of Ma
rine.
Thomson, the new Minister of Ma- '
rine, also made his maiden speech, in
troducing a bill for the reorganization \
Of the French navy, which, it seems, is
inferior to those of all other Continen- '
ta) nations. On this he plans to spend
in annual installments of j
$20,000,000. The Socialists in vain op
poped the adoption of this plan, which I
postpones social reforms.
The Senate has completed a law re
ducing military service to two years.
It has taken up the Sunday rest bill.
Interest in the work of the Chamber of
Deputies still centers in the debate on
tho bill for the separation of the
church and state, which rapidly is
progressing.
There have been a certain number of
striker, none of which is important. At
Brest, Laval, St. Etienne, and even in
Paris, there has been a mild labor agi
tation against the tribunal of com
merce. Workmen are protesting
against the custom of this 1 tribunal in
quashing systematically the decisions
of the local beards of arbitration, on j
which the laborers are represented.
A brawl wag caused among the popu- .
lace on account of the red flag which â 
a procession unfurled as the exhibition !
of thaâ¬ banner never is tolerated by the
police.
But these labor troubles are nothing
beside those which are harassing Rus
sia and which may force the Czar to I
make peace on account of the strike '
of railway employes, which is prevent
ing supplies and provisions from reach
ing the armies in Manchuria.
King Alfonso of Spain is to make an
official visit to France in May and I

TO BEAT RAIL
Theresa McHenry Describes
Part She Took in Alleged
Assault on Her Admirer
FEAEED BODILY HAEM
Damage Suit Discloses How
Plaintiff Was Lured to
Place Chosen for Attack
The trial of the suit of Garfield
Rayl against Frank Hancock, Roland
Murdock, John Doe Daly and Sol
Landsburg to recover $299 damages
sustained from an alleged beating by
the defendants was begun yesterday
before Justice of the Peace Van Nos
trand. Miss Theresa McHenry, on
whose account the trouble is said to
have occurred, was the first witness
to be called and she gave a graphic
recital of the manner in which the
plan to punish Rayl was concocted
by the defendants and of the part she
took in inveigling Rayl to the place
agreed upon for the assault.
"I went up to Hancock's room in
the Angelus Hotel," said Miss Mc-
I Henry, "for the purpose of request
j ing him to cease annoying me with his
! attentions, as I was afraid I would
j lose my position as a stenographer.
â¢ Hancock was not in at the time, but
; after a little while he came in, ac
| companied by Daly. We left the room
| and walked up to the Edgmere Hotel,
, where Murdock and Landsburg joined
us. After a little talk the four men
j compelled me to go to a telephone.
| call up Rayl and inform him that I
wanted to see him. One of the men
threatened to beat my head off and
: as I was afraid the men might do me
; bodily harm I consented to aid the
' scheme they put up to beat Rayl. I
i got Rayl on the phone and told him
| that I had won $25 at the races and I
wanted him to meet me at Sanguinet
ti's restaurant to help me spend it.
'â  He agreed to meet me and the four
plotters and I walked down to San
guinetti's. On the way down Mur
dock kept punching me in the back
as an inducement for me not to back
out from the plot. I walked on ahead
and met Rayl at Sanguinetti's, but
told him I expected a lady friend, and
after describing her I asked him to
( walk down Davis street to meet her.
He left me and some time after I met
Hancock, Murdock, Daly and Lands
burg and they told me that they had
| half killed Rayl and were glad of it."
Rayl was put on the stand and told
of how. after leaving Miss McHenry.
he walked down the street and was
pushed up against the wall by a
stranger, whom he afterward identi
fied as Daly. Daly apologized, but
about this time Hancock hit Rayl over
the eye with what the latter alleges to
have been a pair of brass knuckles.
Murdock and Landsburg also jumped
on Rayl. according to his testimony,
and Rayl fought back. Rayl says he
succeeded in forcing two of his an
tagonists to the gutter and was get
ting the best of the fight when by
standers came to his assistance and
dispersed the attacking party. The
case went over until next Tuesday af
ternoon, when the plotters will put
in their defense.

FORGER IS
CONVICTED
Verdict of "Guilty"
Against Cassie
Chadwick.
Jury Arrives at Conclusion
Alter Deliberating
Two Hours.
Fourteen Years' Imprisonment the
Maximum Penally That Can
Ec iDfiicted.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 11.â Mrs.
Cassie L. Chadwick was to-night found
guilty of conspiracy to violate the
United States banking laws by con
spiring to procure the certification of
checks on a national bank when there
were no funds in the bank to her
credit. She was found gruilty on every
count of the indictment upon which
the jury was at liberty to judge herâ
seven in all.
The indictment contained sixteen
counts. Two of these were ruled out
during the trial by Judge Taylor, and
of the remaining fourteen, one -half
charged her with having secured the
certification of checks without having
the proper entries made on the books
of the bank.
Judge Taylor in his charge directed
the Jury to disregard these counts and
consider only the remaining seven,
which related to the certification with
no funds on deposit. On all of these
the Jury found against her.
According to the law she can be
fined on each count not more than
$10,000 or imprisoned not more than
two years.
MRS CHADWICK HEARS VERDICT
The jury left the courtroom at 3:35
o'clock. It was announced two hours
later that a verdict had been reached
and that the jurors asked to be taken
out to dinner. Word was sent to
Judge Taylor and he set 8:30 o'clocP
as the time at which he would appear
in court to receive the verdict. The
jury went out at 6:15 o'clock and re
turned at 7:30 o'clock. Court was
opened promptly an hour later and the
verdict was read.
Mrs. Chadwick came into the court
room about five minutes before the
jury. She was accompanied by her son
and two trained nurses. She sank into
the seat she had occupied during the
trial and rested her face in the palm
of her right handâ a position she held
almost constantly throughout the ses
sions of the court.
At first Mrs. Chadwick failed utterly
to grasp the meaning of the verdict.
She is slightly deaf and Clerk Carleton
read the verdict in a tone so low that
it was nearly inaudible ten feet away.
As those around her began to move
and talk the prisoner grasped the fact
that her fate was decided. She shot a
quick glance at Judge Wing.
â¢'We have lost, Mrs. Chadwick," he
said.
PRISONER BREAKS DOWN.
This time she realized it. She turned
half around to look at Emll Hoover,
behind her, and reading there a con
firmation of the words of Judge Wing
she flushed deeply and raised her hand
in a bewllderins; fashion to her head.
Suddenly her limbs seemed to give
way beneath her and she sank feebly
Into hsr chair. Her head fell forward
on her hands and a succession of
strangling sobs came from her, while
Emil -and Judge Wing sought vainly
to comfort her.
'The Government moves for sen
tence, your Honor," said District At
torney Sullivan.
"'%> desire to enter a motion for a
new trial," said Judge Wing.
"I will at" a future time set a date
for thÂ» argument on the motion for a
new- trial." said Judge Taylor, "and I
presume the matter can rest until that
time."
â¢That is satisfactory to the Govern
ment," said Sullivan.
Judge Wing bov.-ed a (silent assent
and stepped back to the side of his
distracted client.
ATTACK OF HYSTERIA.
Mrs. Chadwick soon regained a sem
blance of composure, raised her hand,
wiped her eyes and arose to her feet.
Attended by Emil Hoover and the
Marshal, she walked steadily to the el
evator. It was not there, and in the
slight delay most of Mrs. Chadwick's

LONDON, March 11. â Should the
confident predictions of tailors be
realized, green will be the fashionable
color for men's attire this summer
green in all shades, ranging between
the aggressiveness of the catseye and
the subdued pallor of brussels sprouta v
The shops already indicate the
change from the present somber black
and brown, which even the smartest
men affect. Olive green hats and
automobiling caps, even dark green
bowler hats, confront one in the hat
ters' windows, and greenish tweeds
and still more pronounced green flan
nels are to be seen at the most fash
ionable tailor establishments.
The long coat is lengthening in a
marked degree. The waist is to be so
tight that a man who wishes to live up
to his coat must model his figure by
the advertisement columns in ladies'
papers. The trousers, too, are to be
much tighter. A fashionable tailor in
the West End says men are becoming
tired of black and grays. The colored
coat is bound to come, for men's views
are distinctly broadening on the mat
ter of dress. For instance, the fash

smart to-day would have been con
sidered vulgar last year. It just re
quires one or two to take the lead in
a reform which most men are longing
for, and the green of this season is
a step in that direction.

Kansas Drilling; Contractor Produces
Freight Bills at the Santa

INDEPENDENCE, Kans., March 11.
In the Investigation here to-day by
the State against the Atchlson, Topeka
and Santa Fe Railroad, John Smith, a
drilling contractor, who was on the
stand yesterday, was recalled. Smith
referred to the difference in freight
rates between oil well supplies and
other commodities and alleged that in
some instances oil well supplies were
taxed more than 100 per cent in ex
cess of the rates paid on other com
modities for transportation for the
same distance. He produced freight
bills and memoranda exhibits.
On cross-examination by attorneys
for the railway, Smith admitted that
the minimum weight at which a rail
road company would allow a whole car
to be used was 5000 pounds. He also
seld that a. drilling stem was thirty
eight feet long and requires a whole
car to transport it. Because it is tem
pered steel and easily damaged, noth
ing else could be shipped in the same
car. While a stem weighed only 1500
pounds, companies required freight on
6000 pounds, because that was the
minimum weight at which they would
accept a carload shipment.

RUSSIAN GENERAL GETS AWAY WITH
MAIN PORTION OF HIS FORCES.
AbandonsGunsand

Victors.
LOSSES ENORMOUS
Slav Fox Himself
Directs Rear
Guard
ENEMY IS PURSUING
Kuropatkin's retreat from Liaoyangr,
considered one of the most masterly
In history, has been far overshadowed
b> the latest feat of the Russian gen
eral. After fighting for nearly three
weeks against a force now said to
have numbered close to half a million
men, losing in killed, wounded and
missing probably a third of his army,
or nearly 100,000 men, and a fourth
oi his artillery. Kuropatkin gathered
what was left together north of 3iuk
den and is taking them toward Ti*
Past,, through n rain of shrapnel
which is being thrown upon them from
both right and left.
There is stiU, however, a chance oX
General Kawamura'g army taking a
hand hi the battle and should It strike
the Russians at Tie Pass or cut their
communications to the northward the
disaster to Kuropatkin's once fine
army will be complete.
What part of his army the Russian
general has saved apparently is not
known at the Russian headquarters.
All dispatches Indicate that part of
his force has been cut off. General
Kaulbars seems to have extricated his
corps, likewise Bilderling, but not so
with Llneviteh.
A press correspondent says the Jap
anese surrounded the First and Fourth
Russian corps and adds that help
could not be sent to them. Their fate
is not recorded and the inference Is
that they have suffered either annihi
lation or capture.
TIE PASS, March 11 (2 p. m.).â For
many versts all the approaches to Tie
Pass are covered by troops, artillery
and baggage transports pressing
northward, and twenty-five miles away
the strong rear guard of troops, which
is commanded by General Kuropatkin
in person, is retiring slowly, dogged
ly disputing with the pursuing enemy
every foot of ground in order to cover
the retreat to the rear of the army.
The losses in this defeat, which is
the most bitter yet experienced by the
Russian army, by a moderate compu
tation is not less than 140,000 men on
both sides.
The Russians, in addition, sacrificed
enormous quantities of munitions and
stores, the greater part of which were
set on fire before leaving, Mukden.
It is impossible to say whether the
Russians will be able to puf up a fight
and hold this position or whether It
will be necessary to continue to re
treat to Harbin, but the rank and file,
whose military qualities never shone
so brightly as in the defeat, are far
from being panic-stricken, and un
der capable leadership and given a
brief time to strengthen positions, may
be able to check their pursuing enemy
at this point.
HOW THE BATTLE WAS LOST.
The order to abandon Mukden and
retreat to the Tie Pass position was
given at 9 o'clock on the evening of
March 9. At dawn of that day the
Russians held a line on the Hun River
from a point ten miles east of Fushun
to Madyapu, the west front extending
to a Doint six miles north of Mukden
station, and the continuous line of bat
tle generally paralleling the railroad,
four or five miles distant.
A terrible dust storm raged and ten
sion had reached its extreme limit. It
was realized that if any point of the
Russian line gave way all would be
lost. The position in the most extreme
danger appeared to be north of Muk
den station, where it seemed for a time
that the Japanese might break through
and entirely cut the lines of retreat.
General Kuropatkin concentrated
heavy columns there, took command
himself and succeeded during Thurs
day morning in forcing the Japanese
back from the railroad and also in
driving out bodies of Japanese east of
the railroad.
RUSSIAN LINE BROKEN.
The maneuver appeared to point to
success, when news arrived that the

OFFICIAL DISPATCH DOES
NOT REVEAL THE LOSSES
"Our Armies Are Out of Danger," Reports
the Commander in Chief.
BT. PETERSBURG, March 12, 2 a. in.
Russia still has an army in the
Far East and its line of retreat is not
cut. Field Marshal Oyama's trap was
again sprung too late to bag the prey
he desired, and though pounded on the
rear and both flanks by artillery and
losing heavily in killed, wounded and
prisoners. General Kuropatkin. with
the main portion of his forces Intact, is
filing slowly back to Tie Pass, whither
a considerable part of his army has
already arrived and Joined hands with
the reserves in preparing a position
behind which the beaten army may
find shelter.
General Kuropatkin himself, with the
rear guard, was reported on Saturday
afternoon in the vicinity of Syanzia,
twenty-five miles below Tie Pass, hav
ing accomplished some fifteen miles of
his retreat and being already beyond
the jaws of the trap as originally set.
How many of his men he was obliged
to leave behind and whether any of
the units of his army were cut off or
captured before the retreat was begun
ia not stated.
LINE OF RETREAT NOW OPEN.
Both General Kuropatkin's official
dispatch art* that of the press *Trom
Tie Pass were filed on Saturday after
noon. The news contained in these
dispatches will cause unbounded relief
in St. Petersburg, which, in the ab
sence of any information since Kuro
patkin's laconic "retreat begun," pub
lished on Friday, had come to believe
the Tokio rumors that the entire army

would be driven to the mountains and
forced to surrender. A long day's
march, or even two, remain to be ac
complished, but the retreat now pre
sents no tactical difficulties and is be
lieved to be largely a question of shak
ing oft the pursuing Japanese from
flank and rear, and apparently no
longer a matter of cutting a way
through a formidable force.
The press dispatch from Tie Pass
was filed with great difficulty by the
correspondent, who left Mukden with
the rear guard, spent Friday with
General Kuropatkin, and took a long
ride to Tie Pass on Saturday morning,
after which he again returned to the
front. The dispatch indicates the strat
egy of Field Marshal Oyama's double
turning movement. The attack on the
west side is regarded as a feint, but
as having been designed to have the
jaws of the trap closing on the east
meet at the village of Tawan on the
Mandarin road, where a mountain
range pointing like a gigantic finger
scuthwestward toward Mukden begins
to slope sharply away from the road
and the railway.
WHERE IS RENNENKAMPFF?
Whether General Rennenkampff's
corps or even General LJnevitch's army
was cut off to the eastward, or whether
they had already turned on the central
army, it is impossible to learn, but even
if these forces are cut oft they might
have a chance of conducting a retreat.
According to the press dispatch from
Tie Pass, General Kuropatkin seems
before the battle to have yielded to
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
the united opinion of bis principal gen
erals, who were in favor of standing
at the Shakhe River and offering bat
tle, and later on, in ordering retreat,
to have gone counter to the opinion of
the same council.
Events show the decision was taken
not a moment too soon. The credit of
bringing off the army, therefore, ia
largely Kuropatkin's, as he took per
sonal charge of the rear guard and ex
posed himself as fearlessly and
lessly as the merest private on thÂ«
fighting line. Whatever may be the
verdict of history with regard to thÂ»
generalship in the battle, nothing but
the highest praise can be extended the
Russian rank and file, who include a
fine stamp of men.
MAY PAUSE AT TIE PASS.
Whether the retreat will pause at
Tie Pass or whether the army will
make its next stand farther alor.
the mad to Harbin will depend on the
extent to which Kuropatkin has im
proved the naturally strong advan
tages of this position, and the condi
tions of his army, especially the extent
of the supply of munitions and artil
lery, and largely to the condition of
the pursuing Japanese, whose exhaus
tion may be too great to enable them
to push home a determined attack at
Tie Pass.
Among the rumors current in St.
Petersburg yesterday one was that
General Kaulbars and his staff were
among the captured. It is impossible
to obtain confirmation of this or any

Public for Commercial

iSpeda! to The Call.)
NEW YORK. March 11. â The New
York World publishes an intÂ«-es\lnf In- '
terview between its J correspondent in
London and Signor Marconi. The wizard
of wireless telegraphy will Bail for thlb .
country on the I.6th of this month and
will be accompanied by his . bride, his
private secretary and a number of his j
expert wireless assistants. He comes
here to open ;to the commerce of the â 
world the new high-power trans-Atlaotlo '
stations'.
The "World reporter asked Marconi. ;
"Are you sure your wireless system will i
operate across the ocean, so that it can
be open to the use of the public?"
" "It is absolutely sure." replied Mr.
Marconi, with a self-confident air. as if
he hod nothing else to add on the sub-
ject.
Are you prepared to say when you
will be ready
"Probably within a month. You know
there are 14 submarine cables between
America and Europe, and if one breaks,
messages can be transmitted by on# of
the others. So far we have out one com-
plete wireless line, and I want to make
eure before opening it for commercial
business that it is in perfect working or- '
der, even to the smallest details. I can
to-day send messages across the Atlan-
tic, but so as to be sure of success I need !
to make a few minor modifications. Mes- i
eages will be sent for only 10 cents a
word, while the cables charge 26 cents
a word. On account of the enormous vol-
ume of business of the press, we will
make them the special low rate of S
cents a word, instead of 10 cents, as now j
charged by the cables." -. }â  â '_â 
"How fast can you send wireless mes-
sages""
"We will probably have a much greater
epeed than the cables. There are certain i
natural laws that limit the speed of land ]
and cable telegraphy, but these laws do j
not affect the wireless system. I believe j
we will reach a speed of several hundred ]
words a minute with wireless. We can ;
n<>w send a telegram at the same speed
that words are spoken."
"How far can you send telegrams i
bow?" . j
"We can now send wireless messages
1400 miles over land, 2200 miles from
chore to ship and 3500 miles across the j
ocean." N ; .'-it" I
"What next will you do?" '
:*I will extend my system to the Pa-
cific -end across the Pacific."
"And then?" asked the reporter.
"Eventually." answered Marconi, "I j
will transmit messages all around the
world:" :
VANCOUVER, B. C. March 11.â The !
Federal -Government has Included among \
Its estimates $100,000 for the purpose of I
establishing Marconi stations on the Pa- !
cific Coast. â¢'-"â¢â .-â ,
The foregoing telegrams, showing the
progress of the Marconi system, have re- :
cently appeared in the press of the coun-
try.
The Marconi Company has recently
contracted with the White Star Line to
equip all of its steamships with their
system. As all other important trans- 'â 
Atlantic lines have already been equip- I
pod. it now places almost all trans-At- |
lantic steamships in touch with land and i
gives the Marconi Company a monopoly â¢
in wireless telegraphy. I
The magnitude of the telegraph busi- j
ness is best evidenced by the fact that '
an average of 1,000,000 telegrams are I
cent every day throughout the year. This i
shows that the possibilities of the wire-'
less telegraph are practically unlimited. 1
The Marconi Company is ' already " in ,
receipt of considerable and constantly in- I
creasing revenues. There are already over '.
850 Marconi stations in commercial ope- '
ration, earning: money every day. As an â 
Illustration, during a recent trip of the 1
eteamer "Lucania," over $800.00 in tolls
was collected. It Is. therefore, safe to j
estimate that each ship installation will '
show a net profit of $5000 to $10,000 a ;
year, which, multiplied by the number of !
ships, will amount to several hundred '
thousand dollars annually.
It is estimated that the forwarding of '
press news for the "Ocean Dally." pub-
lished on board the trans-Atlantic liners.
will give an annual profit to the company
of at least $750,000.
The Marconi Company will derive Its
largest profits from its trans-Atlantic
service. . It Is not unreasonable to expect
that with 14 trans-Atlantic Marconi sta-
tions, duplicating the cables, the profit*
will be over $10,000,000, making possible
a net profit for dividends of 150 per cent i
on the entire capitalization from that i
branch of the business alone.
Many readers of this article had the
opportunity a few years ago of investing I
In Bell Telephone stock, and $100 invest-
ed then would have netted them to date

FACIE FOE
Continued From Pa^e 25, Column 4.
Japanese had broken through between
the slender First and Fourth army
corps, taking advantage of the hurri
cane that was blowing clouds of dust
Into the faces of the Russians, to de
liver an attack which the Russians
were not prepared to meet. It was
impossible to support the retiring corps,
ac the reserves, to the last man, had
been sent to the line of battle at other
points, arid ac the danger of communi
cations being severed by this attack
from the east was imminent, retreat
was determined upon and immediately
begun.
The four principal roads leading
northward -toward Tie Pass were com
pletely occupied by a continuous file
of artillery and transports and the re
treating army blackened the country
between.
Before beginning the retreat all the
depots, stores and military buildings
and everything that would be of ser
vice to the Japarrese was set on fire.
i A large amount of baggage ajid many,
guns were abandoned. All rolling
! stock belonging to the railroad was
brought away and not a single car or
locomotive was left at Mukden.
RETREAT DURING HURRICANE.
About 1500 severely wounded Rus
sians and several hundred Japanese
were left in Mukden hospitals. The
remainder of the wounded in hospitals
were cent northward and- a railroad
train remained behind almost with the
rear guard and brought off a trainload
of those wounded in the retreat,, many
of whom reached Tie Pass without
their injuries having been bandaged.
Mukden Station was abandoned at
7 o'clock on Friday morning. The re
treat was dreary and disagreeable to
an extreme. A dust hurricane, blow
ing directly southward, filled the eyes
of the troops, but at the same time
tended to blind the enemy and delay
pursuit from the south.
â¢The retreating columns were bom
barded on both flanks by batteries,
which it was impossible to silence, the
rhells reaching th? Mandarin road
from the east with especial frequency
from the village of Tawan, eight miles
north of Mukden, and Pu, five miles
farther north. Under these circum
stances the retreat was conducted with
astounding precision. which was
largely due to the personal efforts of
General Kuropatkin. who. with hag
gard face and uniform yellow with
dust, was everywhere whÂ»Â»n needed.
REAR GUARD'S HEROISM.
The troor-s composing the rear
guard fought with extraordinary brav
ery under the very eyes of the cfifH
mander in <"hief and the morale of th^
entire army, under the circumstances,
war excellent.
The Mukden defeat is attributed to
many reasons, one of the most import
ant cf which was insufficient informa
tion concerning the Japanese and their
strength, which was far in excess of
Russian calculations.
The censorship bureau at first re
commenced work at Tie Pass, but is
returning to the rear guard, com
munication with which is still open.

NO PEACE NOW,
SAYS THE CZAR
Defeat Onfy Adds to Stubborn Deter
mination to Continue Fipfiting,
Another Army to Be Sent
ST. PETERSBURG, March 11.â A
semi-official statement Issued this
evening is as follows:
"The defeat in Mukden is furnishing
material for conjectures of peace pour
parlers to the European press, which
Is* filled with articles and expressions
of opinion on the subject of peace.
It has been stated in all seriousness
that the Russian Government has in
formed the French Government that
it is the intention of the Emperor to
engage in peace pourparlers.
"We are authorized to declare in the
most categorical' fashion that all state
ments to the effect that it is the inten
tion of the Russian Government to
open pourparlers with a view to the
<;oneluskÂ»H of peace are absolutely
without foundation. The statements
do not emanate from well-informed
â Russian sources. They are simply
conjectures of various correspondents
or are derived from Japanese sourceÃ.
"It is known that Japan is at present
negotiating a loan with British and
American bankers and that she is also
negotiating for 100,000,000 yen (about
$50,000,000) with an oil company, giv
ing as a guarantee naphtha deposits in
North Japan and in Saghalien Island.
Interested parties are encouraging
these reports in order to assure suc
cess cf a loan after removing the fears
caused by the uncertainty as to the
duraticn of the war."
WASHINGTON, March 11.â "After
Liaoyang there was talk of peace.
Russia's answer was reinforcements.
Like Liaoyang, Mukden is the scene of
another retreat, and again Russia's
answer will be large reinforcements,
but of peace not a word."
This was the emphatic statement of
Count Cassini, the Russian Embassa
dor, to-day in the light of the morn
ins dispatches telling of the Russian
retreat. The Ambassador was ac
quainted several weeks ago with the
tinal decision of the Emperor that Rus
sia would continue the war until Rus
sian arms were victorious, regardless
of the time it would require, and that
already preparations are being made
for large reinf<>cements to General Ku
ropatkin.
PARIS. March 11.â Temps, which
usually reflects the sentiment in offi
cial quarters, prints a notable leading
editorial this afternoon, appealing to
Russia to accept ytie! inevitable and
make the best peace* teYms possible.
The paper declares that Russia's sac
rifice will be less than that of 'France
at the end of the Franco-German war,
as France struggled against the dis
memberment of her own â  country,
whereas Russia struggled to hold Man
churia, which she has formally prom
ised to return to China. - Moreover, the
battle of Mukden definitely establishes
Japan's advantage, and therefore self
interest demands that Russia recog
nize her defeat and abandon the
struggle. %
It is gathered that the events of the
next few days may have an important
influence for peace, although an over
whelming Japanese victory is con
sidered in the highest quarters as
likely to retard instead of advance
peace. This is based- on the theory
that the Japanese army, flushed with j
victory, will not halt until the full j
measure of its success Is attained by j
reaching Harbin, thus giving a per,iod j
of intense military activity, In which :
there would be little opportunity for ;
the mature consideration of peace.
The French Government has not
been advised that the squadron com- ,
manded by Admiral Rojestvensky Is ]
returning: to Jibutil, but it is the un- :
demanding that part of the squadron
is returning for the purpose of con
voying the Russian third Pacific
squadron until the concentration is
effected with Rojestvensky.
The Socialists threaten to raise a
debate in the Chamber of Deputies,
criticising France's action In permit
ting the Russian ships to stop in (
Madagascar waters.
XO MATCH FOR OYAMA.
German Army Experts Have No Con-
fidence in Kuropatkin.
BERLIN, March 11. â Lieutenant
General yon Bogusla'wsky, retired, of
all the military critics who endeavored
to estimate the battle of Mukden in
the Berlin press to-day, probably is
the most competent and of the highest
rank. Field Marshal Oyama, he says,
by the greatness of the things
he has done, must be accepted
aÂ« a great commander, espe
cially as he did not possess superiority
in numbers. The battle is of absorb
ing interest for professional soldiers,
because never before have such num
bers been engaged over so wide a ter
ritory. The very magnitude of the
operations has been a test of the in
genuity of the commander in chief.
"I am little inclined," says General
yon Boguslawsky, "to sit at the green
table and give a damning verdict, but
rtill one may be allowed to form an
opinion on ' such facts as are already
available.
"The task of directing 400,000 men
on a single stage, with eighty to one
hundred miles of front, so that each
unit may have its proper weight
against a thoughtful and active enemy,
was too large for Ruropatkin, whose
training was adjusted to the com
mand of some 100.000 men. The brain
in command failed on the Russian side
to perceive the developments and meet
the m with proper precision.
"Oyama was somewhere far from
the rim of the fighting zone, in touch
by field telegraph and telephone with
every important unit^in action. He
was doubtless able to sketch approxi
mately at any time the relative posi
tions of his own and" the Russian divi
sions and co-ordinate the movements.
Even with the fruits of victory not yet
fully gathered, he has achieved an im
mense victory, the effects of which on
the military situation in the Far East
and in the internal situation in Rus
sia must be far and deep reaching."
Colonel Gaedke of the Tageblatt and
other critics arrive at the same con
clusions.

of the other rumors assigning various
specific . portions of the Russian
army to the fate of their Port Arthur
brethren. It appears best to await au
thentic information before jumping at
conclusions.
In Russia's dark hour of defeat the ;
influential newspapers raise no voice. ;
A number of them attribute the major |
portion of the . blame for a long series
of reverses not to military causes, but I
to the faulty internal organization of ,
the country. The Novoe Vremya, in a j
burst of bitterness, lays all at the door j
of the bureaucracy, as was the case i
in the Crimean war.
KUROPATKLN'S DISPATCH.
The disoatch received from General
Kuropatkin, which is timed 6 p. m.,
March 10, says:'
"The retreat of the army was very
dangerousâ especially trying for those
corps which were some distance from
the Mandarin road. The Japanese pen
etrated far into the mountains in the
direction of Tawan. They threatened
our troops, but thanks to extraordi
nary efforts, our armies are out of
danger.
'The enemy cannonaded the route of
our retreat from the east and west.
The Eastern Mandarin road was bom
barded at two points, near Tawan and
the Pu River.
"Our troops are very brave.
"The reason the Japanese advanced
=>o successfully from the south is that
the Hun River, which is covered by
our position at Mukden, was frozen
over.
"General Zervitsky is wounded, but
remains at the front."
PART OF ARMY SUR.RQI XDED.
The previous dispatch received by
Emperor Nicholas from General Kuro
patkin, given out last night, in addi
tion to announcing the retreat of the
Russian armies, added:
"Our retreat Is being conducted with !
the enemy harassing both our flanks. :
The Second army, under Bilderling, j
has suffered the heaviest. both in i
killed, wounded and prisoners. How
many are surrounded is unknown."
The army was still in danger when !
Kuropatkin telegraphed, but the sltua- |
tion is better than the public be- I
lleved.
'ft 'was reported in the military â  .iubs
this afternoon that General Kuropat- j
kin had lost 300 guns and about 60,000 j
prisoners, besides about the same num- |
ber of killed and wounded.
The temper of the imperial family
can perhaps be judged by Grand Duke
Vladimir's response when asked what
would be Russia's reply to General
Kuropatkin's defeat.
"Send another army," was his an
swer.

TIE PASS, March 11. 1:58 p. m.â At 7
o'clock on Friday morning a great ex
plosion, which blew up the Hun River
bridge and immense clouds of smoke
from the burning settlement, gave in
disputable testimony of General Ku
ropatkin's decision to relinquish also
the second of his great positions â a de
cision which was known on Thursday.
The army was withdrawing all the
latter 'half of the night, while the
houses of the settlement had been va
cated earlier, and their lights left
burning. Morning showed, through
the great smoke clouds, low lying for
miles around the settlement, armies
three and four miles deep in all the
main roads, moving northward along
the east side of the railway.
The battle still centered north of the
Imperial tombs, with occasional shots
along the Hun River, where later an
opening permitted the Japanese to
make a quick advance and dash toward
their main operation with the purpose
of concentrating .and cuttiug off the
Russians.
At 11:30 o'clock the Japanese had
partly succeeded, for at Tawan, with
shrapnel they shelled 'three sides of a
rectangle, where the main army was
moving with great exertion over in
adequate thoroughfares. The Japanese,
however, accomplished at this place
nothing more than a momentary stam
pede and though a soldier, crazed by
his efforts, threatened to shoot a cor
respondent in order to take his bag
gage cart for himself, the correspond
ent observed everywhere the admirable
coolness which has distinguished the
Russian army throughout its trying
retreats of the past year.
This retreat must be reckoned as a
wonderful spectacle. For miles infan
trymen and baggage wagons to-day
strew the line of march. 'For rapidity
the Japanese movements for the first
time were outstripped by the Russians
withdrawing. The Russians perhaps
had more at stake than in any pre
vious battle with the Japanese.
The crucial point of the retreat oc
curred at dusk, when the rear guard
troops and the transport, which had
reached Santaitze, ten miles north of
Mukden, suddenly received a rifle and
grenade assault from the Japanese cav
alry, which produced a stampede. The
success of the Japanese in closing
against the armies trying to get away
from the extended Hun River bridge
position was evident.
In ordering a retreat, General Kuro
patkin is said to have declared it was
done in order to satisfy protesting
opinion, and that, whateve: the blame,
he would take it, which in the fight of
events seems to show that he best knew
the capacity of the soldiers.
The battle on the right flank and
around Mukden appears to have been
the greatest of the war, except at Port
Arthur. During the terrible duststorm
of Thursday the Japanese, with maÂ»
chine guns, occupied several empty
houses in a village held by the Rus
sians and otherwise bettered their po
sition west of the railroad, so that
when the retreat came, with Japanese
shells on all sides, it suggested another i
Cronje incident. For ten hours not a
man nor a horse rested, while the |
wounded were being gathered up on ,
the two sides and In the rear and often
in the center, and every energy was
bent toward getting out of the trap, the i
jaws of which were almost upon the
Russians.
At Santaitze the press correspondent, \
with others, lost all baggage in the re
treat
Many bodies of troops were encoun
tered, some of them in advance and >
some in the rear, which were constant
ly mistaken for Japanese. The forty- j
mile retreat was accomplished in sev- I
enteen hours. It was virtually through
a plowed field, with enormous dust j
clouds, which made it impossible to see'!
any distance. A great amount of the '
equipage, ammunition, guns and ,
stores of the Russians were lost.
The losses on both sides are reckoned
at 140,000 for the entire fight.
SLAUGHTER ATTENDS RETRJEAT.
Japanese Attempt to Annihilate Floe
ing Russian Columns.
TOKIO, March 11.â The Japanese
wedge driven through the Russian cen
ter on the Hun River continues to ad
vance northward. It has already ar
rived at Hampu, some distance north
east of Mukden.
It is reported that the Russians are
retiring northward along the railway,
evidently very badly confused, being
caught between the wedge and the ex
treme Japanese left, northwest of
Mukden. They have been heavily pun
ished during their retreat along the de
scribed route, the Japanese shelling the
disordered masses of the Russians.
Minister of War Teraoutchi has tele
graphed his congratulations to Field
Marsha] Oyama and the officers and
men of his army on their victory. Field
Marshal Oyama, in reply, ascribes his
success to the Emperor and the gal
lantry and bravery of his officers and
men.
The full extent of the Russian dis
aster is still unknown here. It is
known, however, that the casualties
and losses in guns and munitions of
war are enormous. Even approximate
figures are unobtainable as yet. It is
expected that the prisoners will num
ber many thousands. Local estimates
of the number taken vary from 20,000
to 50,000.
It is estimated by the general staff
that the Russian forces engaged in i
the present battle number 300.000 infan
try and 26,000 cavalry, with 13<>8 guns.
The estimates of the infantry allows
376 battalions, with an average of 800
men to each.
The following dispatch from the
headquarters of the Japanese armies in
the field was made public to-day:
"In the Singking direction our
forces are now attacking a superior
force of the enemy occupying the
northern height near Fushun. All our
forces in the Shakhe River direction
entirely dislodged the enemy on the
rigrht bank of the Hun River on Fri
day and surrounded the enemy on
the east and north of Mukden.
"According to several reports since
noon on March 10. the Russians filled
the district between the railroad and
the Mukden road in great confusion,
and in a state of utter exhaustion.
Thousands upon thousands of Rus
sians are In the district between San
\vu. eight miles north of Mukden, and
Mukden, retreating north in miserable
condition. Our artillery and infantry
in the vicinity are pouring a fierce fire
upon them, inflicting- heavy damage.
"On Friday our detachment made
a hurried advance and reached the
Pn River, thirteen miles north of
Mukden, and at sunset was inflicting
heavy damage to the remnants of the

WHAT SULPHUR DOES
For the Human Body In Health and
Disease/
The mention of sulphur will recall
to many of us the early days when our
mothers and grandmothers grave us
our daily dose of sulphur and mo-
lasses every spring and fall. â / â¢ v
It was the universal > spring and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all,
, and mind you, this old fashioned rem-
edy was not without merit. â¢
The idea was good, but the remedy
was crude and â  unpalatable . and a
large- quantity had to be taken to get
any effect. "
'.':â  Nowadays we g*.. all the beneficial
effects of sulphur In a palatable, con-
centrated form, so that a sin -le grain
is ; far more effective than a table-
spoonful of the crude sulphur. '*. . '
..".. In Â» recent years research and ex-
! periment have proven that the, best
i sulphur for medicinal use is that ob-
i tained \ from Calcium (Calcium Sul-
; phide) and sold in drug stores under
the name: of Stuart's Calcium Wafers.
I They are small chocolate coated pel-
' lets and contain the active medicinal
; principle of sulphur In a highly con-
I centrated, effective form. . J.' :r: r
I ' Few ; people are aware of the value
of this form of sulphur In restoring
, and maintaining bodily vigor, and
health; sulphur acts directly on tha
liver and excretory organs and puri-
; fies and enriches the blood by the
prompt elimination of waste, material.
Our grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and mo-
' lasses every spring and fall, but the
j crudity and impurity of ordinary
! flowers of sulphur were often worse
than the disease and cannot compare
: with the modern concentrated ' prep-
i arations of sulphur, of which Stuart's
; Calcium Wafers is undoubtedly -the
best and â¢ most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for
! liver and kidney troubles and cure
i constipation and purify the. blood in
a way that often surprises patient and
physician alike.
Dr. R. M.; Wllklns. while experi-
menting with sulphur remedies : soon
found that the sulphur from Calcium
was superior, to any other form. He
says: "For liver, kidney and blood trou-
1 bles, especially when resulting from
! constipation or malaria, I have been
i surprised at the results obtained from
j Stuart's Calcium Wafers. In patients
; suffering from boils and pimples and
I even deep-seated carbuncles, I have
j repeatedly seen them dry up and dis-
i appear in four or five days, leaving
1 the skin clear and smooth. Although
I Stuart's Calcium Wafers Is a proprie-
, etary article and sold by druggists and
! for that reason tabooed by many phy-
| sicians, yet I know of nothing so safe
and reliable for constipation, liver and
kidney troubles and especially in all
! forms of skin disease as this remedy."
At any rate people who are tired of
| pills, cathartics and so-called blood
i "purifiers." will find in Stuart's Cal-
cium Wafers a far safer, more palat-
able and effective preparation.
enemy. Our detachment is now try-
Ing to annihilate them."
Later In the day the following dis
patch was received from the
quarters of the Japanese armies In
the field:
"Our force in the Stngking direction,
after carrying th* enemy's position on
the northern heights of Fushun, pur
sued him as far as Huiyuagpao, five
miles north of Fushun. and at 11
o'clock last night resumed a vigorous
pursuit of him. To-day we captured
a few hundred light railway wagons
and other spoils, which are under In
vestigation."

AWFUL DEATH
OF TERRORIST
Bomb Intended to Destroy
Lives of Others Explodes
in Apartments of Owner
ST. PETERSBURG, March 11. â
The exylosinn of a bomb at the Hotel
Bristol, adjoining the Hotel d'Angle
terre here, just before daylight this
morning, blew to atoms the owner of
the bomb, a man with an English
passport and giving the name of Al
fred DawT M<-Cullom?h, wrecked
the adjoining rooms, killed the wife
of an officer and injured several other
lodgers. The explosion was heard
blocks away and created a tremend
ous sensation.
There is not the slightest doubt that
the man killed was connected with
terrorist riots. The bomb was of the
same power as those which killed the
late Minister of the Interior, Yon
Plehve, and Grand Duke S^rgius.
The preliminary investigation of
the police leads them to believe that
McCullough was engaged either in
packing his effects, as the Hotel Bris
tol was to be vacated to-day, or in
preparing for some desperate enter
prise to-day, when the bomb, which
like all the infernal machines of the
terrorists was provided with gravity
tubes, fell and exploded as the one at
the Hotel dv Xord did.
The police immediately surrounded
the hotel, mounted guardsmen allow
ing no one to go within fifty paces.
MoCullough's legs were torn off and
the Mesh of the upper part of his body
spattered the walls and ceiling, which
were red with blood. At the British
Embassy and Consulate McCullough
is unknown. It is believed that he
was a British subject.

NATURAL CAUSE THEORY.
It Is Set Forth by the Honolulu
Chemist.
HONOLULU, March 11. â Detec
tives Harry Reynolds and Jules Cal
lundan to-day had further interviews
with Miss Berner, but nothing new
was developed.
The theory has been suggested here
that possibly Mrs. Stanford's death
tvas accidental. An overdose of strych
; nine might, so the theorists say, have
been taken intentionally as a tonic.
The slight amount of strychnine in
dicated in the bicarbonate of soda has
suggested this theory. A local chem
ist whose name Is not given has esti
mated that the strychnine in a half
teaspoonful of the bicarbonate of
soda was less than one-hundredth of
a grain, judging by the- analysis of the
rest of the bottle.
The contents of the capsules which
were prescribed for Miss Berner prob
ably contain more strychnine than
would be safe for a person of Mrs.
Stanford's age. The chemist above
referral to says that if Mrs. Stanford
took two of these capsules for their
tonic effect a fatal result was not Im
possible. The capsules also contained
hyoscyamus, another poison.
SAYS POISON CAUSED DEATH.
Dr. Wood Has No Faith in Natural
Cause Theory.
HONOLULU, March 11.â Dr. C.
B. Wood, one of the surgeons
who performed the autopsy, consid
ers as absurd the theory which has
been advanved that Mrs. Stanford died
of angina pectoris. He says that the
presence of strychnine, which is for
eign to bicarbonate of soda, in the bot
tle, disproves the theory that Mrs.
Stanford died from natural causes.
At the request of Dr. David Starr
Jordan, Governor Carter will be an
honorary pallbearer in the funeral
procession here. Others will be ex-
Governor Dole and Timothy Hopkins.
ELABORATE PREPARATIONS
FOR ST. PATRICK'S DAY
Rehearsal of Choruses and Meeting of
Committees Show Activity of
Hibernians.
A rehearsal of the choruses to be
sung at the Mechanics' Pavilion at the
St. Patrick's day celebration next Fri

The executive committee of the St.
Patrick's day convention met In K.
R. B. Hall last evening, T. F. Alford
in the chair, and every Irish society in
San Francisco was represented by its

The decorating committee reported
having made arrangements for the
decorating of Mechanics' Pavilion on
a large seals, the decorations being
similar to those used when President
Roosevelt visited the city. Pratt, the
decorator, was awarded the contract.
The printing committee reported
through its chairman, John P. Mc-
Gulre, that the committee had decided
to get out 5000 quarter cards In three
colors and 60,000 dodgers to be dis
tributed at the various churches
through the city. A report was re
ceived from the Majestic Company
that the tickets for the afternoon en

a pleasing feature of the evening's en
tertainment, as well as a monster
chorus of 260 trained voices, which
â will sing the heart-touching ballads
of old Erin.
M. J. Leonard, the floor manager,
stated positively that he would re
quire the floor to be cleared for danc
ing mt 9:30 p. m. and assurances were
given him by J. P. Hare of the evening

FEW STRIKERS
TAKEN BACK
New York Interborough
Company Disposed to Make
the Most of Its Victory
NEW MEN RETAINED
Former Employes Who Are
Ec - engaged Lose Sen
iority and Increased Pay
NEW YORK. March 11.â Realizing
that their fight against the Interbor
ough Company has been lost, the old
employes of the subway and elevated
railways to-day crowded the offices oX
the company seeking their former po
sitions. Three thousand men applied
for reinstatement, but not more than
500 were accepted, the officials claim
ing to be satisfied with the men who
had enabled them to break the strike
and announcing that in future the
rules as to sobriety would be more
utrictly adhered to.
All applicants were notified that they
would have to pass the physical exam
ination and go to work as new men,
which means that those who went on
strike â¢would lose their seniority and
the increased pay that they had won
for length of service.
Jencks and Pepper, tne strike fead
ers, admitted that the fight had been
lost and advised the men to get back
their positions if they could. As for
themselves, the officers said that they
would not again work for the com
pany.
Jencks held the press responsible for
the result, contending that the news
papers had aroused a hostile senti
ment. The strikers bitterly denounced
their leaders, saying the men were de
ceived by them.
The service on the subway and ele
vated systems has not reached the ef
ficiency yet that prevailed before the
strike, but with the old men again at
work and the incompetents among the
new men weeded out the company
promises that regularity and frequen
cy of trains will be resumed by Mon
day morning. The surface cars were
still crowded to-day, the more timor
ous as yet being unwilling to trust
themselves in trains operated by in
experienced men. Few accidents and
they of a trivial nature occurred dur
ing the day.
REMARKABLE BUSINESS ""XE
BY NORRIS & ROWE CIRCUS
City's Population by Thousands Have
Witnessed Big Show at the
Mechanics' Pavilion.
Norris & Rowe are preparing some
special features to-day that they con
fidently believe will prove a happy end
ing to their nine days' engagement at
the Pavilion. Professor D. C. Smith,
the famous circus bandsman, will com
bine the two bands and render only the
works of California composers in his
concert selections.
Exhibitions of expert horsemanship,
cowboy riding, endurance, skill and
speed will be- given between the circus
people and local vaqueros. The con
tests will be for special gold medals
given by Morris & Rowe. The horses
used will be thoroughbreds from the
Oakland track, and the races around
the hippodrome track will be three
heats. Great sport is expected and
great excitement is sure to follow.
San Francisco has again demonstrat
ed that it is a great city for shows that
catch the popular fancy. The paid ad
missions to date will be over the eighty
three thousand mark. The Norfis &
Rowe management is naturally highly
gratified at the interest shown in their
new shows and will continue to open
their seasons here. San Jose will be
visited Monday and a tour of the coast
cities will follow.

LONG PURSUIT
AFTER A THIEF
Trapper Rides 1000 3liles to
Capture Man Who Robbed
Him and Burned His Hut
Special Dispatch to The C*ll.
PINEDALE, Wyo., March 11.â One
of the most extraordinary rides in the
history of the West has just been con
cluded by B. F. Roberts, a trapper,
who traveled more than 1000 miles in
order to run down and capture Oscar
(Curly) Delmont, an alleged outlaw.
Roberts owned a small cabin in the
Jackson's Hole country, where he is
trapping. Delmont went to the cabin
and was tendered the hospitality of the
place, being almost destitute. Roberts
left on a trapping trip and when he re
turned found his cabin and stables in
ashes. Evidences of looting were dis
covered, and, suspecting Delmont,
Roberts mounted his horse and started
in pursuit of the fugitive. This was on
December 19.
Roberts trailed Delmont to this place
and thence to South Pass. There he
discovered a horse hair bridle belong
ing to him, which had been sold by
Delmont. Delmont had left twelve
days before. Securing a new horse,
Roberts again took up the trail. At
Lander he notified Sheriff Stough and
then started out again. He rode back
to Pinedale, over into the Basin coun
try and back again. At Daniel he
heard of Delmont's capture. About
this time he was summoned to Evans
ton to attend the trial, Delmont having
been turned over to the Uinta County
authorities. He made the long ride to
the county seat, and has Just returned,
Delmont having been bound over t > the
District Court on a charge of ;rson.
In his effort to run down ""Delmont
Roberts rode more than 1000 miles dur
ing extremely cold weather, suffering
great hardships. All of his property
was destroyed in the burned buildings
and he is destitute. Hs spent JISO in
the pursuit and lost the work of his
traps during the winter, but Is elated
over the fact that the alleged outlaw

; believe that they will have some one
! who can throw a light on the mystery
! when the author of the epistles is
j run down. Three detectives are work
1 ing with this end in view.
The anonymous creeds are mali
ciously intended to throw suspicion on
a member of Mrs. Stanford's house
hold, who has been exonerated in the
minds of the police and Mrs. Stanford's
relatives.
CaptAin Spillage had received no
vrcrd from Detective Harry Reynolds

PACKAGE FREE OF POISON.
Chemist Analyzes Bicarbonate of Soda
Found in Mrs. Stanford's Home.
Analysis of the package of bicar
bonate of soda that was found at Mrs.
Stanford's residence failed to reveal
the presence of strychnine. It is be
lieved that the soda in the bottle from
which Mrs. Stanford took- the fatal
dose at Honolulu was taken from this
package, and it therefore follows that
the strychnine was mixed In the bi
carbonate after It had been removed
from the package.
The analysis was mads by Dr. A. G.
' Bothe, superintending chemist of the
! Health Department, at the request of
! Detective Gibson. The following is the
report:
"I went over the sample very care
fu4ly for strychnine, using two or threft
' different methods, and found it to be
absolutely free from strychnine or any
other poison. This proves to my mind
that this sample of bicarbonate of soda
| is not of the package which is alleged
to contain the strychnine and given to
Airs. Stanford.
"My report to the Police Depart
ment is that the sample submitted by
Detective Gibson is an absolutely pure
sample of bicarbonate of soda. If the
stomach of the deceased had been sub
mitted we would have demonstrated
within twenty-four hours the presence
cr absence of even the most minute
traces of strychnine."
The last statement is a rap at the
chemists in Honolulu, whose delay, as
a matter of fact, was due to the re
quest of the detectives.

Ing statements he has given out for
publication and to the department. The
suspects are kept " constantly under I
surveillance,"; any way.- and are avail- '
able at any I time. So it is" deemed bet-, !
ter to wait for word from Reynolds and |
| Callundan before the important move
ie made to chage the Chinese, the maid,
and probably the butler, with conspir- I
acy. :_ .* " ,Â»
The police and the detective agency
think they have the case well In hand.
Almost daily 'â  they ; have been placing ;
Wing:, Miss Richmond and Beverly
through j the ; sweating process, and the >
results have been successful 'in marked
degree. Again and again they have '
been called on to recite their state- \
; ments as to . what occurred on January
j 14 at the mansion on 'Nob, Hill when ;
: Mrs. Stanford was first poisoned.
â  Reiteration has entangled the . . sus- |
! pects in many "conflicting statements â 
and it is virtually out of the mouths j
!of the suspects themselves that the
evidence has : been s gathered that may ,
â¢justify their arrest. They have con- I
trived artfully in many instances to I
deceive their interrogators, but in the
rack of a constant and relentless fire
of questioning, keen searching out of '
detail and nerve-wearing demands to
have the story told over and over they
have involved themselves In meshes I
.out of ; which they could not wriggle.
j OX RIGHT TRAIL. â¢
; Many of these contradictions, which
are both of self and one another, go
to material points in the poisoning
mystery and the authorities regard j
them as clinching proof that they are j
on the right trail.
: ; The most puzzling feature of the de- j
velopments is the matter of motive. ;
There is wide speculation, but no the- i
ory has yet been evolved that is ac- j
.cepted. In this connection it must be 'â 
taken into account that the minds that
would conceive so horrible a plot would
in :â¢' all probability be guided â¢by sug
gestion and motive that would not ap- i
peal to a mind that is normal and rea- i
sonable. . â 
The detectives are threshing out one |
theory, which in effect is that the Po- j
land water, of which lira. Stanford
drank in this city on January 14 before
she was ' taken . sick, j was not poisoned
at that time, but that the strychnine
may have been placed in the bottle by
Miss Richmond while she was on the
way with it to "Wakelee's drug store i
to have it analyzed.
! I*. Her purpose, the police the- :
i ory : proceeds, was to make Mrs.
Stanford think that J . Miss Ber- !
tha Burner, the: private secre- :
i tary, had attempted to - poison her. "
i.The. maid is said to â  have entertained i
ambitions to become private secre- j
..â  tary. She is educated and refined and ;
Â» fully competent for the /post. :. Miss ;
Berner received $200 a month, lived
' with Mrs. Stanford as her equal, and ;
the position was full of attractive fea- I
tures. j
j It is . reasoned by the po- 1
! lice '- that Miss Richmond hoped '
that she would get the place if ;
Miss* Berner were removed and that i
â  this? might have been the motive of a j
Â£ conspiracy into which .the cook was led j
and to which Beverly gave his assist- :
ance because of friendship and what- :
ever advantage might result to him l
from having the former maid In such j
; close relations with- the wealthy wo- 1
man. . . ' I
MOTIVE FOR CRIME. j
' But the motive for the crime . is by !
; no means established, say the police j
and detectives of one accord; but they
feel certain they will find : it in the
: many. : grillings that are yet in store
'"for Mips Richmond, Ah "Wing and |
â  Beverly. .;. ."' ', ...':.' ** I
: Miss Berner has disappeared from [
! all reckonings of the police as a sus

WILL BRING POISONED
SODA BACK WITH THEM
San Francisco Detectives
Take Possession of Evidence.
All Facts Not Made Public
HONOLULU. March 11.â The San
Francisco detectives have secured pos
session of the bottle with the remain
der of the bicarbonate of soda, and
also the remaining capsules and other
medicines found in the medicine chest
of Mrs. Stanford. These will be taken
to San Francisco and analyzed by
chemists of that city. The condition
of the contents of the remaining bicar
bonate of soda may possibly be of the
greatest importance. The nature of
the experiments by which the presence
of strychnine was revealed in the bi
carbonate has not been made public,
no Testimony on that point having been
given before the Jury at the inquest.
The San Francisco detectives have
begun the case all over again, and the
original investigations are being re
viewed by them. Their final conclu
sions will undoubtedly depend upon
the result of the analyses to be made
in San Francisco of ihe bottle of
sitf- answers. He said he was not In
Mrs. Stanford's room that Saturday at
all.
He had admitted that as factotum
of the household he went into Mrs.
Stanford's room several times every
day.
"But on that Saturday," he ex
plained to his interrogators, "I was en
gaged all day in cleaning silverware
down in the kitchen. Mrs. Stanford
had given a dinner party the evening
before and it took me all day to clean
sliver."
"Why did you say at first that you
had gone In and out of Mrs. Stanford's
room several times that day?"
"I was mistaken in the day."
But Miss Richmond, Miss Nora Hop
kins and Young, the Chinese who as
sisted in the second work, have de
clared emphatically that Mrs. Stanford
gave no dinner party on Friday even
ing and that Wing did not spend all
of Saturday in the kitchen at clean
ing the tableware.
The detectives are therefore con
vinced that Ah Wing is not telling the
truth and that he could have been the
person who entered the room and
placed the strychnine in the Poland
water, if it was poured into the bottle
during the day it stood on the wash
stand.
MISS RICHMOND'S CASE.
In the matter of conflicting state
ments, the- police assert. Miss Rich
mond has incriminated herself more
than any of the others. While before
her interrogators she has resorted to
fainting spells when the fire became,
too heavy. On one occasion when ahe
appeared to be undergoing a severe at
tack Captain Burnett suddenly asked
a pointed question in a sharp tone of
vr.ice. She rallied instantly and made
an indignant answer.
Her principal contradiction is in re
gard to who opened the Poland water
bottle, which was taken to Mrs. Stan
ford's room by her, declaring on one
occcasion that she did not know who
did the uncorking and on another oc
casion that McWhinney did. She also
became sadly mixed in her statement
that she gave Mrs. Stanford warm
water for the emetic, saying at first
tnat she obtained it from the wash
stand in the room and at another time
declaring that she ran down to the
kitchen fqr it.
She also asserted that several days
before the poisoning she had given
Mrs. Stanford notice that she would
leave. When confronted with oroo*
to thÂ«Â» contrary she admitted that she
had not done ?o.
In connection with the reason for
Miss Richmond's dismissal there has
been a sensational development dur
ing the inquiries of the police. The
day after Mrs. Stanford was sickened
by the mineral water she had a sore
throat, and Miss Richmond was sent
for to massage it.
When she arrived Mrs. Stanford in
startled manner pushed the maid
back and cried out:
"You go away; I don"t want you to
put your hands on my throat; you go
away."
Miss Richmond has admitted this
occurrence and said that it was not
till this occasion, when she was driv
en by Mrs. Stanford from the sleeping
room, that she thought of leaving her
position.
BEVERLY SUSPECTED.
The police have learned that Bever
ly and Miss Richmond were acquaint
ed before they were* employed to
gether by Mrs. Stanford and that it
was through the butler that the maid
procured her employment at the man

Captain Callundan to-night said th*t
his various interviews with Miss Ber
ner had failed to develop anything new
that would furnish a clew to the person
responsible for Mrs. Stanford's death
Callundan denied the report that Miss
Berner had bean eliminated from the
list of persons under suspicion, but h<?
also refuses to say that she is under
suspicion. He would only say that
there is no change in tbÂ» situation. th~
work done since his arrival having
made no alteration in the mystery sur
rounding the case.
It is very improbable that the conclu
sion of the investigation will be reach
ed here. The determination of the de
tectives to take back wtth tbem the
various drugs figuring in the case
plainly indicates that the solution of
the mystery of Mrs. Stanford's death,
if a solution is reached at all, will be
reached in San Francisco.

ing her to Mrs. Stanford. There ar a
many other circumstances tbat ten<i
to connect Beverly with the conspir
acy, the detectives declare, and they
feel certain that he will bÂ« arrested
with the other suspects.
Tonng, the Chinese boy who was
employed in the residence at the tlmÂ«
of the poisoning, is a nephew of Ah
"Wing. He has been called on repeat
edly to make statements, but he has
at all times been straightforward and
no suspicion attaches to him.
The detectives do not regard Nora
Hopkins in the light of a suspect
whatever. As with Tounjr. Â» dls-poai
tion was found to tell everything hon
estly and she could not be Involved in
any contradictions.

HOMELY VIRTUE
WINS THE DAY
Alfred SutiVs "The Walls
of Jericho" Brings Suc
cess to the Playwright
Special Dispatch to The Call
. LONDON. March 11.â was the
touch of sincerity, of honest convic
tion and homely virtue that suddenly
boomed Alfred Sutro up from the posi
tion of a strugg-ler In Grub street to
the Uace of one of the leading dra
matists of the day. "The Walls of
Jericho," the play that did this kindly
business for its author, is running yet
at the Garrick, and now he has two
mure plays going at the same time at
thÂ« St. James. In the first of them the
curtain-raiser, called "A Maker of
Men," homely virtue comes in strong
again â so strong in fact that the little
play is scarcely a drama at all, but
a homily. A bank clerk Is expecting
a letter announcing ills promotion, and
t*Us his wife how much he is going to
do for her with the increase in salary.
Ttien the letter coir.ccâ bringing the
nÂ«s that the poor fellow has not re
ceived the promotion. His wife says
â hÂ»s happy anyway, and believes in
him and loves him, so what does It
matter? Nothing happens and the dia
logue makes no pretense of being bril
liant, but it iiÂ» simple and sincere and
make* a certain appeal to the aver
age audience.
' Then comes "utro's latest play.

promisingly entitled "Mollentrave on
Women." This ivork turns out to be
comedy, occasionally dropping into
farce, with no ethical significance. In
wit and construction it shows a dis
tinct advance on the author's two other
plays. I venture to predict that it will
have far less success than "The Walls
of Jericho," just because it Is more
sophisticated. "Mollentrave" -himself
Is, however & distinct and wholly de
lightful creationâ a fluent old gentle
man who knows all there is to know
about women and has put it all into
a book whose title gives the play its
name. He assumes the complete man
agement of two sets of love affairs,
playing like a confident virtuoso on the
strings of jealousy, pique, pride and
all the other delicate motives of the
feminine heartâ and making, of course,
tremendous blunders which provide the
complications for the play. When at
last the two couples ge^ themselves
disentangled and properly assorted, the
buoyant Mollentrave declares that this
waa the assortment he had in view all
the time. Mollentraves unctuous en
joyment of his own perspicacity, as
depicted by that excellent actor, Eric
Lewis, saves several situations which
otherwise would be in danger of being
regarded as too improbable for pure
comedy and insufficiently funny for

foremost musical city in thÂ« â¢ world,
now has three big symphony orches
tras, the third having made itÂ» bow to
the public recently. It calls itself "The
International Symphony Orchestra,"
and numbers 100 artists under the lead
ership of Herr Gustave Jaeger. The
new body has aroused considerable
opposition by offering its services to
philharmonic and orchestral societies
at reduced rates. The prices of admis
sion to its first concert were also be
low those usually charged. Karcsay,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 12, 1905.
the Hungarian gypsy violinist, was the
star of the occasion and made a good
impression with selections from mod
ern Hungarian composers.
The poetic drama about Nero, upon
which Stephen Phillips has been en
gaged for so long, Is now nearly fin
ished and Beerbohm Tree, who staged
Phillips' "Herod" and "Ulysses," is go
ing to produce it in the fall. The piece
is in a prologue and three acts and
the action is carried up to the moment
of the Emperor's death. The female
interest in the play seems likely fo be
especially strong, circling as it does,
around three notable women, Agrip
pina, Nero's mother; Poppea, his mis
tress, and Acte, his slave and good
angel. Phillips says that he is trying
to give a rather unaccustomed glimpse
of the Roman despot and that he is
laying particular stress on the poetic
and artistic side of his character. He
will try to show that Nero's cruelty
sprang from an esthetic source rather
than from any real love of brutality.
As a successor to "The Clngalee,"
which has run at Daly's for more than
a year, George Edwardes has selected
a piece by Henry Hamilton which is
called provisionally "Two Little Dar
lings." Hamilton was responsible for
most of the "School Girl" and also
furnished the libretto of "The Duchess
of Dantzic" and the Engliph setting
of "Veronlque."

BY AMENDING THE RULES

Important Changes In the Civil
Service Lows.
WASHINGTON, March 11. â The
President has recently promulgated
several amendments to the civil ser

to increase the scope of what is
known as the competitive service. By
the most important of these amend
ments inspectors of surveyors general
and district land offices and special
agents of the general land office are
hereafter to be appointed only arter

ture. They are still to be appointed
without examination.
TWENTY-SEVEN DERELICTS
AFLOAT ON THE ATLANTIC
Navy Department Called Upon to De-
stroy Vessels Wrecked During
La*t Winter.
WASHINGTON, March 11. â Some
Idea of the severity of the winter sea
son just drawing to a close may be
gathered from the fact that the Navy
Department is now confronted with
the necessity of seeking out and de
stroying" no less than twenty-seven
ocean derelicts which are lying In the
great ocean lane* from Santiago to
New Foundland and fc endangering
shipping entering and departing from
our Atlantic ports. The presence of
these floating wrecks has been re

$4,000,000 and $5,000,000 each.
West Is father of J. B. West, Regis
ter of the Lewlston Land Office, and

Whitaker, also an heir, in London for
three years. During the last seven or

dent Roosevelt la said to be about to
show his eood will toward the South

GERMANY'S SAMOAN CLAIMS
ARE CONSIDERED TOO HIGH
Adjustment of International Damage
Question Is Brought to a Stand
still by Negotiators.
WASHINGTON, March 11. â The
negotiations between America, Great
Britain and Germany, looking to a
settlement of the Satnoan indemnity
claims, have practically come to a
standstill owing to a wide difference
of opinion as to the extent of damage
sustained by the German subjects in
the Samoan group, as a result of joint
operations by the American and Brit
ish naval forces in 1900 to suppress a
rebellion.
The Germans' claims amount to
about $65,000. The British and
American negotiators insist that this
sum Is excessive and that $25,000 is
a good price for the property de
stroyed.

MORE TROUBLE
FOR KIRKMAN
Army Board Learns That
Several Checks Given by
Captain Were Protested
Special Dispatch t* The CalL
OMAHA, March 11. â SomÂ« of thm
testimony already given in thÂ« court
martial of Captain Klrkman, Impli
cated in the recent sensational auicidÂ«
in this city of Mrs. Bessi* Chandler,
wife of a fellow officer. Is already com
ing out from Valentine and Fort Nl
obrara in this State, where tha oourt
martial is being held.
In addition to the details of his re
lations with Mm. Chandler, testimony
was given as to a number of checks
passed by Kirkman in Omaha and
elsewhere which were protested, al
though several of them were subse
quently paid. Among them waa a check
on the Wells-Fargo Bank at San Fran
cisco. The refusal of the Wax Depart
ment authorities to accept Kirkman'a
resignation promises to bring out fuller
facts which have hitherto bÂ«Â«n covered
up.
It has already been developed that
his relations with Mrs. Chandler date
from last August when Lieutenant
Chandler was absent at the maneuvers
at Fort Riley, and that the captain and
the woman were together so much
under circumstances so flagrantly im
proper tlv.t Mrs. Chandler was dis
missed from the Fort. Klrkman fol
lowed her to Omaha and New York.
On January 7 he was brought back
under arrest, though not In custody.
The board is awaiting the arrival of
the depositions of two doctors who
treated Kirkman in the Philippines,
which are expected here by May 10.

THE VALUE OF CHAROOAI*
Few People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coai le the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
I impurities always present in
the stoniaÂ«-h and intestines and carries
them cut of the system.
Charcoal b wee tens the breath after
;ng, drinking or after eating
ns and other odorous vegetables
,:coal effectually clears and im-
ea the complexion, it Mhitena the
and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
t in the stomach and bowels; it
Lfects the mouth and throat from
n of catarrh.
All I sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal end the most for the money
Is in Stuarts Charcoal Lozenges: they
are composed of the finest powdered
w charcoal and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting
lozenpers, the charcoal being mixed
with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
tell in a much Improved condition
of the general health, better complex-
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of it is, that no pos-
sible harm can result from their con-
tinued usÂ«, but on the contrary, great
benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
th>- benefits of charcoal, nays: "I ad-
Vfm Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas in stomach
â owels. and to clear the complex-
'<nd purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box
at drug stores, and although in some
e a patent preparation, yet I be-
lieve I pet more and better charcoal in
hareoal Lozenges than in any
of thÂ»Â» ordinary charcoal tablets."

Titled Britons
Tradesmen in
Secret,
Dublin Wineman
Is Cause of a
Big Row.
6pecial Cable to The Call and the New York
Hvrald. Copyright, 1908, by the New York
Herald Publishing Company.
LONDON, March 11.â Somehow these
"legal proceedings" that noble lords in
variably threaten when their connec
tion, sub rosa, with some money
making scheme is exposed, never come
off. Nothing further has been heard
of the promise made by Lord Tanker
ville. Lord Muskerry. the Earl of
Craven and Lord Braye some months
ago to sue Dr. Lunn, who runs a tour
iÂ«t agency, for the "unauthorized" use
of their names in connection with a
projected tour of the Mediterranean.
And nobody seriously believes that the
recent threat of Lord Lurgan and his
swell associates to sue an Irish wine
merchant, more enterprising than dis
creet, for making an "unauthorized"'
use of their exalted appellations will
ever result in a trial in a court of law.
But as showing how the titled tout
business is worked here the story of
what started the row is worth telling
more fully than may have been de
scribed in the cable dispatches sent at
the time.
Adam Scott, the head of a well
known firm of Dublin wine merchants,
had a laudable ambition to increase
his sales of high class intoxicants.
Such beverages are for high class folk,
and as a shrewd business man Scott
seems to have reasoned that he could
best reach these desirable customers by
inducing some heavy swells to co-oper
ate with him â to act as "drummers"
for the establishment In plain words.
Fashionable life in Ireland centers
around the Lord Lieutenant's court at
Dublin Castle. The castle sets the
fashions in drinks as in everything
else. So the wine dealer appears to
have argued that if he could start a
company and get some of the most
influential and aristocratic of the Lord
Lieutenant's satellites to join him on
a sort of "ground floor" basis there
â would be lots of money in it.
He first broached the matter to
Stokes O'Callaghan, financial secretary
to Earl Dudley, tho Lord Lieutenant,
and a man capable of laking a broad
business view of things. Through
o'Cal'aghan he got in touch with Lord
Lurgan, the state steward of the Lord
Lieutenant; Viscount Chelsea, eldest
son of Earl Cadogan, a former Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland; and_ his younger
brother. Captain the Honorable Gerald
Cadogan. They axe now posing as the
innocent victims of the wiles of Scott,
bent on seeking reparation for the
damage done their reputations in a
court of law. But it is significant that
it is nowhere suggested, even by them
selves, that they received Scott's over
tures with the scorn and contempt they
now display in protesting against the
association of their honored names
with his scheme.
NO TKIAIj OF SUITS.
Just what was the nature of the
propositions made to them has not been
divulged. And because legal proceed
ing?, if pressed, would result in disclos
ing this interesting information, is the
reason why no sensible person believes
that the matter will ever be thrashed
out in court.
Believing that everything had been
fixed satisfactorily, Scott proceeded to
launch the new company under the ti
tle of the LondorKand Dublin Wine As
sociation. Lord Lurgan's name ap
peared at the head of it as chairman,
while Viscount Chelsea, the Honorable
Gerald Cadogan and O'Callaghan fig
ured as directors, Scott assigning to
himself the role of managing director.
Of course, it would have been patent
to everybody who knows how the wires
are worked here for what purpose
Scott had got together such an aristo
cratic board of directors, and by what
methods they would be expected to
help along the business. But Scott
showed too much eagerness to reap
the reward of his enterprise. He
issued an entirely superfluous circular
in which he gave the whole thing away.
To be sure, he took the precaution of
marking it 'â¢private and confidential,"
but that did not deter an envious trade
rival, into %yhose hands a copy fell,
from giving publicity to it. The circu
lar, after setting forth, in big capitals,
the names and titles of tho directors,
proceeded to give details of their vari
ous private "pulls" in this fashion:
"Lord Lurgan, K. C. V. C, is state
stfward to his Excellency, Lord Dud
ley, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and
j.^ppesses great influence with his Ex
cellency and most of the nobility of
ihr United Kingdom, and is in par
ticularly good relations with Vincent
Iâ¢ â â  kran, the gentleman who pur
chases the Lord Lieutenant's wines
and spirits.
"Viscount Chelsea is the eldest son
of the Earl of Cadogan, late Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, who the week
before last entertained his Majesty,
King Edward, and her Majesty, the
Queen, at his seat, Culford, and among
those who were present to meet their
Majesties were Lord Lurgan, Viscount
Chelsea and Captain the Hon. Cterald
Cadogan, younger brother of Viscount
Chelsea, â¢
"Mark Stokes O'Callaghan is finan
cial secretary to Earl Dudley, Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, and is in close
touch with the Catholic Bishops and
c\<rgy of the United Kingdom. Mr.
OCallaghan is a born salesman, and
can get wines into places that we could
not reach.
"The directors are in treaty with
several other influential noblemen to
Jcin the board of the new company,
each of whom will briny to the com

devote a large share of their time to
personally pushing the sale of the
company's goods among their friends,
and such a combination must prove
successful in popularizing and creating
a demand for any article the new com
pany enthusiastically undertakes the
sale of."
DTRKCTORS WAX ANGRY.
Of course, the aristocratic directors
"raised Cain'" when they saw this in
print. They treated the public to a
most edifying spectacle of righteous
wrath and indignation.
"I need not tell you." said Lord
Lurgan to an Interviewer, "that such
a circular was issued without either
my knowledge or consent. It is dis
praceful and vulgar and when I first
saw it I was simply astounded. I im
mediately wrote a letter to Scott and

WOMEN IN Bl SINESS.
The "titled tout" busines is not re
stricted to men. Many women of rank
and high social position are engaged
in selling all sorts of articles on com
mission from pedigreed puppy dogs
to pianolas and automobiles. In fact.,
these petticoated drummers are more
numerous, persistent, subtle and In
gtnious than the swell masculine
commercial agents in disguise. But
their names do not appear in prospec
tuses and they do not openly sell.
They simply "recommend" and claim
a "rake-off" on the orders thus ob
tained.
Women who are avowedly engaged
in trade cannot be presented at court.
Lady Duff-Gordon, for instance, who
conducts a fashionable dressmaking
establishment in Hanover square,
where she makes a specialty of "'emo
tional gowns," cannot appear at any
of the King's levees. But it is gen
erally understood that several aristo
cratic women tout for her who are
"persona grata" at court. It Is a sys
tem that puts a premium on humbug.
Not a few beautiful and well known
women are agents for photographers.
Of course, they do not solicit orders.
They present their latest photographs
to their acquaintances, mentioning in
cidentally, perhaps, that the Duchess
of X never patronizes any other stu
rlio. And when the seed thus so\vn
bears fruit they reap their reward.
Other women in similar fashion intro
duce perfumes, cosmetics and even
soaps. Nothing comes amiss out of
which money is to be made â "on the
quiet." A legion of fashionable dames
get their own gowns made for noth
ing, besides a liberal commission on
the orders they influence.
But it is as a motor car agent that
the aristocratic feminine tout has the
best time of it. The firm for whom
she works "unbeknownst" supplies
her free of charge with one of their
costliest cars and most skillful chauf
feurs and stand elaborate feeds to
which prospective victims are invited
after a delightful spin.
Society is permeated with disguised
touts. They play the game in all sorts
of ways and not always fairly. They
have no league for mutual protection;
they do not love one another, but self
interest restrains them from giving
one another away. To be found out
is the fatal thins.

CITY AUDITOR OF NAPA

NAPA, March 11. â A short time ago
the City Council decided to improve
the triangle of the park at Second and
Wilson streets by erecting a stone
drinking fountain. The ladles of the
New Century Club, an improvement
organization of Napa, put in a bid for
$200 and were awarded the contract
for doing the work. They subsequent
ly employed J. B. Newman, a contrac
tor, to do the work and he completed it.
To-day City Auditor J. T. York refused
to draw a warrant in payment for the
work on the ground that Newman was
a member of the City Council and so
could not legally accept a contract for
wcrk that must be passed on by the
City Council. The City Council had
ordered the bill paid, but it is now
probable that a warrant will not be
drawn.

dents of the San Ramon Valley met in
Grange Hall, in Danville, to-day. The
meeting vai called to order by J. G.
Anderson. A. J. Young, president of
the day and one of the oldest and
wealthiest residents of the valley, In
troduced Hamilton Wright-of the Cali
fornia Promotion Committee, who paid
tribute to the beauty and fertility of
the valley in a stirring address on the
benefits to be derived through the or

Contra Costa County to the Lewis and
Clark Exposition; Hon. A. J. Young,
J. A. Anderson, Mrs. S. F. Kamage,
Charles J. Wood Jr., R, O. Baldwin and
others. A feature of the meeting was
a protest against the Southern Pacific
Company on its exorbitant rates and
poor service. A fare of $3 20 is charged
for the round trip to San Francisco,
distant 55 miles by railroad and but
eighteen miles in a direct line. The
journey now takes from five to seven
hours from San Francisco by the morn
ing train. A committee was appointed

pany, as it is claimed this service ha*
held the valley back. As a result of
the meeting a permanent organization
to be known as the San Ramon Valley
Improvement Association was formed.
The officers are as follows: J. G. An
derson, president; Hon. A. J. Young,
vice president; Milton S. Labaree, sec
re ta#; John F. Baldwin, treasurer.

oldest and most prosperous agricultural
districts in the State. The residents
are now aroused to the necessity of
keeping up with the march of progress
and attracting settlers who are now
coming into the State. A $4000 town
hall will be built. A meeting of the
association will be held at Walnut
Creek March 25.

Then the lady proceeded to elucidate
th- cause of Ah Tup's berserk act and
the manner of its performance. She
hsd known him for a long time as a
quiet and industrious caner of chairs
and the shattering of her estimate of
his character shocked her almost as
much as did the attempted demolition
of her 'abode. When she awarded tp
him a contract to repair three of her
sit ting-room chairs she did so without
misgiving as to either the quality of
his work or the price he would charge
for it, and when he returned the arti
cles of furniture she murmured neither
at their appearance nor his bill of
costs, but went so far as to pronounce
the one excellent and the other very
reasonable. Then she told him that
her purse was empty at that moment,
but would be replenished when her son
came home, and hinted that he could
leave the chairs and call later for his
money. To her astonishment he flew
into violent rare, tore the new caning
out of the chairs and began to smash
windows. Her screams of affright
brought police aid.

he abandoned his mother's roof, tak

be sure, but he hoped for higher things
than watering the flap-eared elephant
of India or bedding down the sacred
cow of Ceylon. He desired to say,
without incurring suspicion of egotism,
that he possessed the qualities which
compel success. Since his first circus,
he might add, his single aim had been

If he were now sent to jail he would
rate his release by becoming an

If this boy were mine he should go
with the circus."
#> I don't want to have him sent to
jail," murmured the yielding mater.
"Of course not," acquiesced the
Judge, "nor. do you want him to go
with the circus. But the circus is the
least of the two evils and I'll tell you
why it is. If he goes to jail he will
be handicapped in after life by the
prison taint. If he goes with the cir
cus he will probably have his glamor
dispelle* within a very short time and
return to you a wiser and a better
boy. You may derive comfort from the
reflection that less than one-tenth of
one per cent of the boys who run away
from home become stars of the ring.
Their ambition quickly perishes. They
soon learn that circus life is not all
glitter and plaudits."
"I guess he may as well go with the
circus," said the mother.
"Sensible decision," was the court's
comment. "And if he does not return
to you withinâ well, say a monthâ you
may congratulate yourself on being the
mother of a boy who is exceptionally
fortified with the grit and perseverance
of which men are made."
James R. Lake, accused of having
burglarized a telephone box in a Mar

be wiser for him to plead guilty of
petty larceny than stand trial before a

the penitentiary.
The main witness for the prosecution
was Frederick Manning, a bartender,

This statement was made to-day by

Rev. E. E. Baker of Oakland
Speaks to Large Audience
at Chamber of Commerce
Rev. E. E. Baker of Oakland de
livered the short sermon to the busi
ness men in the assembly-room of the
Chamber of Commerce yesterday. The
spacious apartment was crowded
when the well known clergyman rose
to speak and his remarks were of deep
interest to the army of busy workers.
Dr. Baker took his text from the
seventh verse of the gospel of St.
John, "Now this is life eternal, that
they might know thee^, the only tmÂ«
God, and Jesus Christ whom thou
hast sent." In part Dr. Baker said:
"The first question is answered by
the affirmation that man is a worship
ing being. He is so by nature. As a
well known writer hath it, 'Heaven
gave our blood a moral flow.' The
first circle of a man is the environ
ment of his home; then comes soci
ety; then civic duties. Like the
flower that grows in harmony with air
and soil and dew, man is in harmony
with his God. It is a force within
that works out and comes into con
tact with the influence of God. TVny
are we Christians? Because Chris
tianity helps us know God. It af
firms the character of God. It de
velops the great truths of God's fath
erhood, our sonship, our brother
hood and the value of human life.
"All other religions are vague. They
fall to unfold thÂ« truth of Immortal
ity. It was Christ alone of all the re
ligions that gave to man a definite
certainty of the hereafter. Herbert
Spencer passed out into the darkness
without one consoling thought. He
groped but found no light. And yet
he who is the light of the world said
I am the resurrection and the life.'
Nearer and dearer than wife, children,
friend is the Divine Master. In whom
may be cultivated the closest union of
all life."

SENIOR FACES
GRAVE CHARGE
Accusation by Miss Corinne
Barry Against Bulkeley,
1 'niversity Yell Leader
WARRANT IS PROCURED
Prominent College Man Ar
rested at San Jose Upon
< < Â»in plaint of Former Co-Ed
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
214S Center street, March 11.
The spectacular career of Lewis E.
Bulkeley. a senior at the university,
yell leader for the varsity rooters, and
a prominent fraternity man, assumed a
new phase to-day, when a warrant for
his arrest was sworn to by Mies Co
rinne Barry, ho graduated from the
university with the class of 1903. She
charges Bulkeley with seduction. De
spite her distressing condition she
journeyed with her mother, Mrs. Ada
B. Hent. to the office of Justice R. S.
Edgar last night and there made a long
affidavit covering twenty typewritten
pages, containing a series of allega
tions against Bulkeley.
The matter was promptly referred to
District Attorney Allen, and a war
rant for Bulkeley's arrest was issued.
Bulkeley is believed to have known
that some such action was pending,
for. he left Berkeley suddenly two days
ago. going to San Jose. Officers found
him there to-day and he was arrested
this afternoon and brought to the
County Jail at Oakland, where he was
released on bonds of $4000.
Miss Barry, his accuser, was promi
nent in her classes at the university
and graduated with honors. She has
eince resided at 13S8 Shattuck avenue
with her stepfather, J. Hent. a lawyer
of San Francisco, and her mother, Mrs.
Ada B. H*-nt. Her acquaintance with
Bulkeley began in 1902. In August of
that year, she alleges, Bulkeley com
mitted a felony, after promising to
marry her. She says their relations
have been maintained since that time.
Bulk-l ey maintained apartments of a
sort deemed palatial by most of the
college folk. In the yeais preceding his
entrance to the university he created
a sensation with his gorgeous rai
ment, affecting ultra -sensational styles
in garmentry. One of his creations
was a green and yellow all velvet suit,
which startled San Francisco when
Buikeley paraded, thus attired, through
Bthe town. The youth had inherited a
gicat deal of money from his parents,
both of whom are dead, and much of
the fortune is said to have been dissi
pated before he entered college.
In the university town his escapades
have kept him in the public eye. On
April 2. ISO 4, Miss Mary Engle, for
merly a servant at the Hotel Wal-
K worth, where Bulkeley then lived, at
tempted to cimmit suicide at the home
of Mrs. F. N. Dela.r.oy in Alameda,
where she was employed. The girl's
troubles were attributed by her to
Bulk.
As yell leader of the university Bulk
eley enjoyed considerable prominence,
|*lt being his duty to lead the big band
of "rooters" that are always in evi
dence at university meetings, football
or baseball games or college activities
of the more public sort. His wit and
â .city have combined to make him
successful as a yell leader and in con
sequence he enjoyed popularity and in
fiUi*pee in his class councils, despite the
blzafre record he had made in other
end earlier college years.
SAX JOSE, March Lewis E.
Bulkeley was arrested here to-day by
Sheriff Ross. The complaint Is made by
relatives of Miss Corinne Barry, who
is said to be a well -known young lady
of Berkeley. Bulkeley is a son of the
late Lewis E. Bulkeley, a well-known
attorney of San Francisco. Miss Barry
Â« it-- to be 24 years of age.
Bulkeley declares the arrest is a
blackmail scheme. He was In jail all
afternoon, but was released on bonds
famished by friends here.

KITE STRING
WRECKS WIRES
Electric Flames Burn Out
Fourteen Blocks of Tele
phone and Light System
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 11.
With a roar that could be heard a
dozen blocks away, two of the high
power wires on the Franklin-street line
of the Bay Counties Power Company,
carrying 40,000 volts, were burned out
at the corner of Fourth and Franklin
streets at 1 o'clock this afternoon, and
falling upon the wires of the Oak
land Gas, Light and Heat Company,
wrecked the entire lighting system on
both sides of Franklin street, from
First to Fourteenth. The heavy cur
rent was also transmitted into the tele
phone system, every instrument on
both sides of Franklin street being
burned out.
James J. Gallagher, general foreman
of the Oakland Gas, Light and Heat
Company, said that the accident was
caused by the dragging of a kite string
over the wires, two of which were thus
connected, causing a short circuit. As
Foon as the accident happened the cur
rent was shut off on the lines of the
two companies, and after several hours
of work the damage was repaired.
The breaking of the wires caused the
blowing out of a number of fuses in
:> near the scene, and the fright
ened inmates, thinking the dwellings
were on fire, turned in alarms, which
brought the department to the scene.
The only fire, however, was in the
home of L. Bercovleh at Fourth and
Webster streets, which was damaged
bo the extent of $50. The home of M.
Licht at oil Harri.=on street was filled
with smoke by the burning out of the
fupe, but no damage was done.
A man known as "Doc" Carpenter,
who keep.*' a peanut stand at Four
teenth and Frankiin streets, was so
badly Crigbteoed by the electrical dis
play caiiFea by th a falling wires that
he received a plight paralytic stroke.
He was taken to the Receiving Hos
r-ital.
At nightfall almost all the damage
done to the telephone and electric
lisht systems ha*l been repaired.

Court of Miracles Would
Have Been Truly Proud
of Sly James O'Connor
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 11.
After acting out a pantomime in the
court where he was adjudged insane
and had been committed to the Stock
ton insane asylum, James O'Connor, a
"deaf mute," suddenly regained his
power of speech on his way to the
asylum this morning and conversed
pleasantly and intelligently with Dep
uty Sheriff Reilly.
O'Connor is a professional beggar
and gains his living by distributing
cards, upon which is stated that he is
"a victim of the Johnsto%vn flood and
a survivor of an Arctic expedition."
He was arrested and taken to the City
Prison, where he acted so queerly he
was thought to be Insane.
It now develops that O'Connor Is a
sham. During his examination Judge
Ogden got an inkling that he was act
ing and admonished him that if he did
not talk he would commit him to the
asylum. The only answer was a series
of gesticulations and inarticulate
sounds and the commitment was made
out. When Reilly got as far as Niles
Junction he started to take the wrong
train, when O'Connor spoke up and
told him of his mistake. Pretenses
were then thrown aside and O'Connor
confided to Reilly that he begged be
cause it was easier than to work.
He said that he had saved up $3600, but
had lost half of this sum in an un
fortunate speculation and had the rest
of it buried.
Reilly then asked him how he liked
the idea of being put into the asylum
and he informed him that this was his
fourth trip there and that he knew all
the ropes and that he would sooner
go there as a patient than serve out a
sentence in Jail.

that press of public business will not

the reason that it would afford me the
greatest pleasure in the world toâtes
tify by my presence the high regard I
have for the gentlemen who are be

DIES SUDDENLY
AT STOCK FARM
William T. Halpin, Husband
of Papinta, the Dancer,
Victim of Heart Failure
WAS IX GOOD HEALTH
Managed Ranch While Wife
Was on Tour of the East
With Company of Players
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, March 11.
William T. Halpin, husband of the
famous and fascinating dancer, Papin
ta, dropped dead suddenly this after
noon at the beautiful Papinta stock
farm, three miles from Walnut Creek
in Contra Costa County. His unex
pected demise is thought to have been
due to heart disease. He was enjoying
his usual good health up to the time
he was stricken.
Halpin managed the ranch, which his
wife purchased eight years ago and
which, through her enterprise and her
love for fine horses, has been made one
of the select horse farms of California.
In his younger years Halpin was an
athlete and was widely known and
popular throughout the United States
with sporting and theatrical people,
having traveled extensively with his
wife. Halpin was only 35 years of age.
He was a native of New York.
Halpln's sister. Miss Lorena V. Hal
pin, was with him when the end came.
She had summoned Dr. Leech of Wal
nut Creek to attend her brother, but
the patient passed away before the
physician arrived. Papinta is at pres
ent tourine the Eastern States with a
theatrical company. Her husband left
her a few weeks ago to return and su
perintend affairs at the ranch, which
has ever been the pride of the
danseuse.
Papinta stock farm contains 162 acres
and is situated in a fertile and well
watered country. Live oaks dot the
estate and wild flowers, ferns and syl
van attractions abound. The whole
farm is watered from a private water
supply and all the buildings are illu
minated with electricity. There are
eight separate paddocks on the farm
for the accommodation of brood mares
and the!r foals. Thirty acres of the
ranch are planted to prunes and al
monds.
LABOR COUNCIL OPPOSES
IMMIGRATION OF JAPANESE
Sets Forth That Aliens Are Crowding
Natives From the Public
Schools.
The Law and Legislative Committee
of the Labor Council, which body has
now under consideration the framing
of a declaration in opposition to the
immigration of Japanese into the
United States, will probably embody
the number of alien Japanese attend
ing the public schools. â¢
It Is alleged that the number of
Japs attending the schools in this city
causes a crowded condition to the ex
clusion of white American children,
who, it is claimed, are entitled to an
education in preference to adult aliens
who avail themselves of the school
facilities "for the purpose of acquir
ing an education by which they will
be enabled to compete with white la
borers."
Intelligent members of the labor or
ganizations in this city cont?nd that
as soon as the war is over in the Far
East thousands upon thousands of
Japanese will flock into the United
States to escape the heavy taxation
that must fall upon those who remain
at home, though others say the open
ing of Manchuria and larger oppor
tunities will not only keep the Japa
nese at home, but will attract many
thither from this country.
What may be termed a cleaning up
of kitchens is one of the sanitary
measures now being agitated by. the
Cooks' and Walters' Union. With a
view of rectifying this condition of
dirt the municipal authorities will be
asked to enforce the sanitary measures
on the offending restaurants and
cheap lodging-houses.
As a penalty for backsliding a mem
ber of the Cloakmakers' Union was re
admitted to membership on the pay
ment of a fine of $25. This union will
give its annual ball in Golden Gate
Hall on Sunday evening, March 19. A
committee has been appointed to
make arrangements for the event.

PURE AMERICAN
ART IS NEEDED
So Says Sir Caspar Clark,
Newly Appointed Direc
tor of New York Museum
EXPECTS DEVELOPMENTS
Briton Declares Artists of
This Country Lack Confi
dence in Their Judgment
LONDON', March 11.â More purÂ«
American art by American artists for
America is the essence of thÂ« Ideas
held by Sir Caspar Clark, the newly
appointed director of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art at New York, of what
is most needed in America. In an in
terview to-day Sir Caspar spoke en
thusiastically of art in America and
cordially of his recent visit to thÂ«
United States. He said there was no
reason why the museum at New York
should not be one of the greatest m
the world. He expects to develop art
in America and hopes to teach Ameri
cans to have greater confidence in their
own artistic judgment, their own re
sources, their own artists and their
own art. He said:
"In building the museum I shall
avoid the errors that have hampered
the great museums of this country.
There shall be no cliques and no fos
sils in the Metropolitan management
if I can prevent it. Americans fail to
recognize their own geniuses. The
country is full of talent. Some of thÂ«
best artists in Europe are American
born, but Americans demand that they
shall be hall-marked in England or la
Europe before they will pay American
prices for their work.
"The fine arts should be fully devel
oped right in America, not simply for
art's sake, but with a view to their
application to the Industries. As an in
stance, in the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, there are no patterns of furniture
tcv Arr.irfcan manufacturers to study,
and in other departments, such as ce
ramics, textiles, gold, silver, bronze
and ironsmiths' work the museum is
very deficient. I believe the finest silks
in the world could be raised and the
best art patterns could be made in
America. If the silk culture was de
veloped in the South it would ultimate
ly become one of the most important
Industries of the country.
"I found foreign art everywhere I
went tn the United States, but I hope
the day will come when American art
will be the most sought after by
Americans."

down." said Mrs. Kate Kinyon to a
messenger boy a3 she gave him her
nine-months-old baby to bring to h^r
mother-in-law. She has not been aeÂ«n
since and though there is some doubt
as to where she went, it is thought
that she has eloped. It is known that
she had previously received a mes
sage saying, "Hurry, Kate. He says
he'll take us both. He"ll take the 10
o'clock train."
Mr. Kinyon is a youngf mechanic
at the Santa Fe shqps. The couple
were married about two years ago.
but married life was never happy with
them owir.g to the wife's restless -lis
position. Kinyon is highly thouK
by his employers and companions and
the affair has caused a sensation here.
CORONERS JURY DECI ARES
FITZGERALD IS GVILTT
Holds Him Responsible for Death of
Man Whom ire Knocked Off a
Porch at Kennett.
REDDING. March 11. â At the Cor
oner's inquest to-day James Fitzger
ald was held to be responsible for :he>
death of Patrick Rucsell, whom ha
knocked off of a high porch of a sa
loon at Kennett on Thursday. Two
witnesses to the affair testified that
Fitzgerald deliberately pushed It miâ H
from the porch. The men had .
reled shortly before and appearances
led to believe that the deed m com
mitted with intent to kill. The crime
is the first one of note in the new town
of Kennett.

AN EASY WAY
I\> Keep WelL
It is easy to keep ell if we would
only observe each day a few simple
rules of health.
The ill important thing is to keep the
stomach right, and to do this it is not
necessary to diet or to follow a set rule
or bill of fare. Such pampering simply
makes a capricious appetite and a feel-
ing that certain "favorite articles of
food must be avoided.
Prof. VTJechold gives pretty good ad-
vice on ihis subject; he says: "I am 68
years old and have never had a serious
illness, and at the same time my life
has beon largely an indoor one. but I
early discovered that the way to keep
heaJthy was to keep a healthy stomach,
not by eating bran crackers or dieting
of any sort; on the contrary I always
eat what my appetite craves, but dally
for the past eight years I have made it
a practice to take one or two of Stu-
art's Dysj>epsia Tablets after each meal
and 1 attribute my robust health for a
man of my age to the regular daily use
of Stuart's Tablets.
My physician first advised me to use
them because he said they were per-
fectly harmless and were not a secret
patent medicine, but contained only the
natural digestives, peptones and dias-
tase, and after using them a few weeks
I have never ceased to thank him for
his advice.
I honestly believe the habit of taking
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets after meals
Is the real health habit, because their
use brings health to the sick and ail-
Ing and preserves health to the well
and strong." Â» â¢?
Men and women past fifty years of
age need a safe digestive after meals
to Insure a perfect digestion and to
ward off disease, and the safest, best
known and most widely used is Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets.
They are found in every well regu-
lated household from Maine to Cali-
fornia and in Great Britain and Austra-
lia are rapidly pushing their way into
popular favor.
All druggists sell Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, full sized packages at 50 oents,
and for a week stomach a fifty cent
package will often do fifty dollars'

MAY A SAILOR
OF NEW SCHOOL
Man of Science Gets
Ahead of Old
Sea Dogs.
Given Command of
England's Big
gest Ship.
Special Cable to The Call.
LONDON, March 11.â Just appointed
commander-in-ohief of the Atlantic
fleet, with the King Edward VII, the
bi^^est and most powerful fighting
craft in commission, as his flagship,
VkÂ» Admiral Sir Wiliiam H. May is
generally regarded as the coming man
in the British navy. And this despite
thr i&ct that things have not run al
together smoothly between him and
Admiral Sir "Jackie" Fisher, the man
now at the top as first Sea Lord of the
Admiralty. But strong men cannot al
ways be expected to pull well together.
Sir William is 55 years old, but looks
a good ten years younger. He entered
the navy as a midshipmite when he
was 14 and has climbed the ladder of
promotion without the aid of any in
fluence other than his own merit. He
has no actual war service to his credit,
but he can at least claim to have ex
tended the British empire, for when in
command of the Imperleuse on the
China station he annexed Christmas
Island and thus added another red spot
on the maps. He represents the clear
headed, hardworking scientific new
school type of naval officer who has
taken the place of the fine old sea dogs
of the days of wooden walls and ding
dong fighting at close quarters.
Guns and torpedoes are his special
ties. He was two years in command
of the great naval gun-training estab
lishment at Whale Island and among
other things has been Director General
of Naval Ordnance and assistant Di
rector of Torpedoes. He has invented
a device for the more effective dis
charge of those deadly weapons.
LORD OF THK ADMIRALTY.
For the last four years he has been
a Lord of the Admiralty, with the re
sponsible duties of Controller of the
Navy, which gave him general super
vision of the construction and equip
ment of warships. It is this billet
which he has given up to take service
afloat again and incidentally escape
rubbing up against Sir Jackie." The
difference between the two men is in
dicated by the fact that the jack tars
have never ventured to dub Sir Wil
liam "Bill" or "liillie." He is a man
of too much punctiliousness and dig
nity to admit of such familiarity even
among hie most intimate friends.
For his flagship the claim is proud
ly made by Great Britain that she is
the world's finest bAttleship, and
before his appointment terminates two
yean hence he will have seven similar
vessels under his command. By that
time Uncle Sam may have a ship or
two afloat to dispute supremacy with
her, but she is certainly by long odds
the most formidable fighting craft that
England has yet turned out. She is
of 16,350 tons displacement and on her
trials attained a speed of more than
nineteen knots. Originally it was esti
mated that she would cost $7,112,000,
which is fully J2, 500, 000 more than
has been expended on any battleship
hitherto built in this country. A num
ber of Improvements introduced in her
equipment since she was designed have
considerably increased the original
estimate of her cost. Among her
unique features are platforms erected
high up on the masts on which, when
In action, gunnery officers will be sta
tioned to direct the fire of the guns.
Supplied with the latest range-finders
and able to observe the enemy from a
commanding height, they will be able
to direct the weapons below so as to
obtain that crushing concentration of
fire essential to speedy victory.
NEW FIRING MJSTHOD.
This new method of g-un fire control
1b the result of a series of experiments
conducted in the Mediterranean, which
demonstrated that great as is the part
which the "man behind the gun" must
take in a naval action, still greater de
pendence will have to be placed in the
Intelligence and Judgment of the "man
above the gun." To accuracy of
shooting is to be added accurate infor
mation as to where to shoot to obtain
the best results. Thus the officers,
high placed on the ffun directing plat
forms, where they can best observe the
hostile ships, will in future order the
firing, concentrating, it may be, all the
weapons on the leading vessel of the
enemy's column or on a weak rear
guard â in short, so directing the guns
as to produce the greatest amount of
damage in the least possible time.
The armament of the King Edward
VII is by far the most powerful yet
Installed on any British battleship. It
consists of four 12-inch guns, dis
charging 850-pound projectiles; four
8.2-lnch guns, firing 380-pound shots;
ten 6 -Inch guns and twenty-four
smaller .weapons for repelling torpedo
attacks. In all respects she represents
the Latest achivements of science ap
plied to fighting machines afloat.
In no man-of-war has such a com
plete electrical equipment been in
stalled. This motive power is largely
employed in place of steam, so as to
save weight and minimize expense and
danger. The power motors number
over 100, from the fifty-horsepower
one for working the capstan and coal
heists to the numerous small ones for
driving the electric fans to purify the
air in the confined spaces below decks.
She >*an carry 2000 tons of coal, which
would enable her to steam at least
8000 knots at economical speed. Her
double bottoms have been utilized for
cerrying oil to be employed in com
bination with coal.

TORTURET"
BY ECZEMA
Whole Body Mass of Soresâ Could
Not Sleepâ Had Given Up
| Hope of Recovery.
CURED BY CUTICURA
iâ  â  .
; Spent Hundreds of Dollars Trying Every Doctor
in Neighborhood, but Kept Growing Worse
I All the Timeâ Completely and Permanently
Cored by Cuticura at Expense of $8.
"I have been tempted a number of times to write you' a volun-
tary letter telling how Cuticura Remedies saved the life of my
mother, Mrs. William F. Davis, living in Stony Creek. Conn.
"Some years ago she had Eczema, the worst case I have wit-
nessed in my life. She was able to sleep only a little, scarcely ate at
all, and how she kept alive was a wonder. She had tried every doc-
tor in the neighborhood, but kept growing worse all the time. Her
head was a mass of sores, the ears swollen and painful, and the dis-
ease spread until it appeared on almost her entire body. It affected
her hands and wrists and made housework out of the question. So
bad was her condition at this time that she despaired of a recovery.
"Finally, after she had spent hundreds of dollars without re-
ceiving any benefit, living in misery for years, with hair whitened
from pain and suffering, and body terribly disfigured, a friend
came to her and told her she would get the Cuticura Remedies if she
would use them. But mother was discouraged and without hope.
She said, 'Nothing will cure me: I must die with it." However, she
began using the Cuticura Soap, Ointment and -Resolvent,.' and when
she had used three bottles of Resolvent, five boxes of Cuticura-
Ointment and ten cakes of Cuticura Soap, Â«he was entirely cured:
Her hair returned to its natural color, dark brown, and she looked
ten years younger. I have written telling you of- this because 1 feel
it a duty to my fellow men to let them know of ; this wonderful
cure by Cuticura. â¢ ; ; , . \
"Having mother's case in mind, I have often recommended
Cuticura to. those suffering with humors. While living in Hart-
ford, Conn., I had the pleasure of knowing a number of friends who
were wonderfully cured by Cuticura.
"Here in New York I have just been to see a young man who
has been sorely afflicted with a terrible humor. He tells me that
Cuticura Soap, Ointment and three bottles of Cuticura Resolvent
cured him. I could give you the names of six or seven others for
whom Cuticura has worked remarkable cures. Now, feeling that I
have done my duty, I shall be pleased if you will publish this letter

CROOK ESCAPES
FROM SHERIFF
Harry Richards Eludes the
Vigilance of Officer and
Jumps From Moving Train
CITIZENS GIVE CHASE
Criminal Believed to Have
Received Aid From Pals
AVlio Followed From South
The passengers on the coast line lim
ited train which arrived in this city
shortly after 11 o'clock yesterday morn
ing had the experience of witnessing a
daring crook make his escape from a
Sheriff! The man who performed the
clever act was Harry Richards, sup
posed to be a notorious safe blower.
The man from whom he escaped was
Sheriff Coburn of Riverside County.
The scene was enacted just before the
train pulled into the station at Twenty
sixth and Valencia streets. Coburn and
his prisoner were on their way to San
Quentin, to which Richards had been
sentenced for two years for stealing a
bicycle. Richards caught the officer
napping and made a run for the plat
form of the car.
He fell off without difficulty, as the
train was going slow. Coburn followed
closely after his man, shouting at the
top of his voice for aid. These yells
only served to stimulate the fleet-foof
ed crook, for he developed a sudden
burst of speed and was soon well on
his way toward the San Bruno wilds.
OFFICER SLOW SPRINTER.
Coburn was not as apt a sprinter as
his prisoner, so he saw that something
must be done. He quickly rounded up
a posse of citizens and vagrant dogs.
The cavalcade soon set off on the trail
of Richards. The last seen of them
they were still doing the best they
could to develop top speed and over
take the criminal.
Strange to say. Coburn did not notify
the local Police Department of his ex-*
perience. It may be that he has not
yet returned frÂ»m the chase. It is vmat
improbable that the criminal was over
hauled, for in that event some of the
officials would have heard the news.
Richards is believed to be a mem
ber of a notorious gang of safe orack-r
ers that has been working with much
success in the southern part of th^
State for some time. Three weeks ago
a gf-.ue whs caught in the act of blow
ing oj:en the safe of a Riverside piari
ing mill. The night watchman who
detected them had a !â ' ining fight
v.ith the gang, but they made their
escape.
STOLE WHEEL AND RAX.
One of the men stole a bicycle in
order tÂ«. elude the watchman and the
next day Richards appeared in th->
town and tried to dispose of a wheel.
It was identified as the one stolen thÂ»
night before. Richards pleaded guil
ty to stealing the bicycle and was sen
tenced to two years in San Quent n.
It is believed beyond a doubt that
Richards was one of the men who
blew open the safe, but as no direct
evidence was gathered against him h>
r. as not prosecuted on that charg--
Th<- rest of the gang escaped and the
Fouthern police say that they proba
bly lay iri waiting for Richards x'n -n
he jumped off the train yests/diy
iro.-nii's.
The police can do nothing in fhi
matter till they are notified of Rich
ards' escape. It is believed that \hz
crook will stand an excellent charted
of eluding the southern Sheriff if tlje
latter floes not call for assistance. !-:â¢â 
is not iVtmiliar with this part of Â£hÂ«Â«
country, while Richards probably
knows U like a book.

CHILD'S FROLIC
ENDS IN DEATH
Five- Year-Old Lillian Hen
n is Killed Instantly
Tiider Wheels of a Dray
The life of a pretty little five-year
old jhild was crushed out under the
wheels of a heavy dray on Polk street,
between Turk and Golden Gate ave
nufl, last night shortly after 5
o'clock. Lillian Henry, the baby
daughter of James Henry, a clerk in
the Hotel Redondo, while playing on
the moving vehicle fell under the
wheels and was almost instantly killed.
The little girl, with a number~of
other children of her age, were play
fuliy climbing on the back of the
dray, which belonged to the Morton
Drayase Company. The wagon had
a canvas cover over it, and the driver.
Thomas Daly, was not aware that the
children were' on his dray until he
felt the wagon lift perceptibly. On
looking back he was horrified to see
that ho had run over a child. He and
John Fastene of 846 Filbert street, who
was riding with him, hurriedly stop
ped, picked up the mangled form and
rushed the little one to the Central
Emergency Hospital. When they
reached there the child was dead.
Little Lillian Henry's skull was
crushed as an egg shell by the big
wheels. The little baby who was glee
fully stealing a ride a few moments be
fore was placed on a cold slab in the
hospital mortuary.
Eye witnesses say that the child fell
from the wagon under the wheels.
Driver Daly was arrested by Police
man J T. Graham and booked at the
City Prison on a charge of manslaugh
ter. He was released on $50 bail.

SAYS POISON
WAS IN WINE
Doctor Tells Police That
Fluid Woman Spat Out
Was Full of Deadly Drug
A cat that died from drinking pois
oned wine: aged Mrs. Joseph Marshall,
who is said to have sampled the same
wine. Dr. Carvtno, who gave the cat
the deadly potion â these and like inci
dents are to figure in a guardianship
case in Judge Kerrigan's court next
week. The contentions of the pros and
tons have already reached the propor
tions of a small feud in Italian quar
ters.
Dr. Carvino reported to Detective
Chief Burnett yesterday that Mrs.
Marshall, widow of Joseph Marshall,
former president of the Veteran Fire
men, drank a mouthful of wine sev
eral days ago and spat it out, saying
it had a* peculiar taste. The doctor
added that he took a sample of the
same wine and gave it to his cat, which
died seventeen minutes after drink
ing it.
The relatives of Mrs. Marshall, who
live with her at 1112 Powell street,
brand the story of Dr. Carvino as false
and maintain that the doctor and Juan
Jose Arzave. a barber at 106 Montgom
ery avenue, are casting reflections
upon the relatives and are conspiring
to set control of Mrs. Marshall's es
tate, which amounts to $30,000.
From the conflicting stories toid
there Is evidently a row brewing over
an estate. It is said that the story
was started to influence the guardian
ship question when the case comes up
before Judge Kerrigan.
H. D. Marshall, a nephew of aged
Mrs. Marshall, says his aunt is 78 years
old and that Arzave took advantage
of her feeble condition, sold her lot
tery tickets and had himself appointed
her guardian. After the nephew and
H. D. Donohue. a grandnephew, had
shown their aunt that Arzave had been
extravagant, it is said, she deposed the
guardian.
Arzave Â«ays he is still guardian of
ted. But this is obviously a means
to promote matrimony. Â»
No longer is the ciub-lie, honored by
ancient usage, a domestic necessity â
that is, v>hen paterfamilias is a Union
Leaguer.
Now when he longs for the good
story, the congenial spirit, the brandy
and soda he calls out. "Jane, put on
your hat and come to the club with
me" â and thus, while Jane is made
happy so is he.
Fine! For well he knows that though
the same roof shelters them, Jane will
be absorbed with her cards in the
"annex" and won't bother him in his
chat, nor about him.
And thus has the club-lie become as
old Junk in the Union League Club,
and thus does the club go upon record
as doing yeoman service in reducing
the possibilities of. divorce.
But of ""Annex," what of that.'

and in tone with the general setting of
the room.
Last night, when these splendid
apartments were christened, every
able-bodied club member and his ladies
thronged the building, access being;
offered to every nook and corner of it
â almost.
Not this winter has there been a
smarter foregathering of interesting
people, and they werÂ» alive, quick,
alert Surely there can be no dead
ones" in the club, else were they net
within sight last night.
During the evening a string orchestra
gave good music on the parlor
while in the main grill CM
Hawaiian singers crooned the songs vt
Aloha-land.
In all the available rooms were re
freshments being served, and gay
parties made merry everywhere.
There appeared to be no formal re
ception commit v club member
seeming to hay constituted himself a
committee of one. although C
George Pippy and his staff were alert
for the pleasure and comfort of tfet
club's guests.
It i? a matter of note that when rh
club came to furnishing the annex they
had a lot jf money, but alas! they
didn't know what to buy.
So they called a consultation of the
house committee and the upshot of it
was a frank confession of igr.<Tar in
furnishing rooms "to suit women." so
they urged Mrs. M. H. de Young to
undertake the task After much de
liberation the matter was adjusted,
with the delightful results as above
stated.
Truly was the . 0* venture superbly
launched last night, treating many
pretty memories.
And blessings on the men who
publicly acclaim that women ARE
clubable!

Four Favorites Come, In
at Oakland and Talent
Best the Books.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Sir Wilfiel may not be a Domino nor
an Artful, but he possesses that requi
site quality, spe^d, to a marked extent.
He captured the Bell stakes over
five furlongs for 2-year-olds at Oak
land yesterday in a thoroughly work
manlike fashion. Mary F, an old
little fil'iy from the Jennings
stable. In receipt of- the maiden allow
ance, finished second. Roman Gold,
the spry brown filly from the Macdon
ough stable, ran third, after a stiff
early action with the winner.
On X'ftst form Sir Wilfred looked the
bent, and the Cameron colt opened an
even money chance. It was difficult to
gauge the class of Roman Gold, for
while her two win? had been impres
sho had stowed away only ordi
nary one*.
Midi MONEY OX lU3MAX GOLD.
Still she looked a promising possibil
ity and much money wa? wagered on
her chances at 8 to i. From 20, the
price about Mary F dropped to 10.
Daiuma. Abe Meyer iind Fred Bent had
many admirers. At the start Eddie
Walsh on Roman Gold was quickest
aw&y. but could open up no gap. Jakie
Jont-s almost immediately joined him
with the favorite.
Before the stretch bend had been
reached Sir Wilfred gave the cold
shoulder to the filly, assuming a com
manding lead. Knapp kept busy with
Mary F on the rail and the sturdy
little Miss responded so gamely that
Jones shook the first choice up, win
ning by a length and a half in 1:01.
It was a remarkably fine performance,
as the trp.ck did not appear extremely
fast, and a strong southerly wind
blew down the front stretch. The
Stake was worth $2580 to the winner.
FOUR FAVORITES IX FRONT.
A large half-holiday crowd wit
nessed some excellent sport. As four
favorites were returned first, specula
tors had all the best of the play.
An ordinary collection of three
year-olds started In the introductory
mile selling run. Alone, from the
Summers stable, had the call at 9 to
5, and despite good handling ran
third. Golden Buck, from Johnny
Schorr's string, cut out the pace for
eeven-eighths of the distance and was
then beaten out by Calculate, a 7 to 1
chance. Floyd Fountain piloted the
winner.
Many excuses were offered for the
downfall of Misty's Pride in the five
and a half furlong run, but it ia more
than likely that Andrew B. Cook could
repeat the trick right over again to
day.
DAVIS RATES HIS MOUNT.
The latter horse ruled favorite in the
betting, and Davis rated him the first
part of the race. When it became ap
parent that Misty's Pride had the foot
ing over E. M. Brattain Davis sent the
first choice after the Oregon mare, and
after bringing her to a hard drive won
cleverly by a head in 1:07%. The gray
horse, E. M. Brattain, run third.
Dr. Rowell's gelding, Hugh McGowan,
had the time of his life winning the
mile and hundred yard selling affair.
He went to the gate a 7 to 10 choice,
and Travers just dropped him in first,
a nose before the pacemaker, Matt Ho
gan. The show went to Mogregor.
"Kansas" Price closed his Western
tour by taking the mile and a sixteenth
selling number with Padua. The Max
io horse received substantial support at
6 to 5, and with W. Davis on his back,
breezed home before the 30 to 1 shot,
Albula. Scherzo, never a contender,
lost the show to Stilicho.
MINDANAO DEFEATS TOLEDO.
Birkenruth probably took matters
too indulgently with Toledo, and Min
danao beat his mount out a nose for
the mile handicap. A misdirected
plunge caused the 3-year-old, A. Musk
oday, carrying Knapp and 96 pounds,
to be played down from 3 to 8 to 5
favoritism. He showed signs of sore
ness going to the post and evidently
was not at his beet. After receding in
the betting from 2% to 4% to 1, Min
danao, piloted by Jones, shaped up all
the running, and in a breath-suspend
ing finish, was awarded a nose verdict
over the late arrival, Toledo. Once the
runner up, Muskoday ran a fair third.
TRACK NOTES.
W. Davis is getting "back into the
old groove again, for he piloted two
winners. Jakie Jones scored a like
number of wins, one being on Sir Wil
fred.
"Kansas" Price won enough on
Padua to take his stable on to Ben
nings by easy stages.
If the Lake County stable has any
more like Mischief, be it known that
there is a circus in town.
Pedigree enthusiasts claim Sir Wil
fred is one of the finest bred young
sters In the country.
When Divina fell with Prank Sulli
van the unlucky apprentice had his
collar bone broken. The accident hap
pened opposite the stand.
The stewards of the association
across the bay suspended Jockey S.
Bonner yesterday for absenting himseif
without leave from the stable of his
new employer, W. B. Jennings. From
what can be learned, Bonner left for
Georgia, accompanied b> r George
March. He is expected to show up
at the Memphis meeting.
Twenty-four books rut in and busi
ness in the ring never seemed better.

Judge Shaw did some remarkable
bowling when he and A. Foreman beat
two such exDerts as Crowe and Tick
ner. The score was 21 to 17 In their
favor.
Foreman and E. Medeau proved
much too strong for W. Watson and
G. C. Patterson, beating them 21 to 10.

Mare Lowers Pony Record
Midlove, a diminutive daughter of
the great horse Midlothian, made her
debut as a pony in the races yesterday
at Ingieside track. Sporting the beau
tiful copper colors of Charles W. Clark,
the Montana millionaire, and ridden by
E. Reay Mackay, an Australian ama
teur jockey, she ran the half-mile in 50
seconds. The previous record, made in
the races of the Pony Association, was
5114 seconds.
Midlove carried 150 pounds, which
makes the performance a brilliant one.
This was not the only victory scored
by the Clark stable. Bas Blancs, rid
den by R. M. Tobin, captured the three
eighths-mile race handily. The mare
had the speed of her field and fairly
breezed in.
Captain de Crespigny, the polo play
er, won two races on Queen Rucker,
the Southern California pony. Captain
de Crespigny has won some noted stee
plechase races in England. He showed
superior horsemanship yesterday.

not disagreeably affect the system in any way as do most of the so-called tonics on the market,
which contain Potash or some other harmful mineral ingredient to derange the stomach and

CARDINAL NINE
St. Mary's Towers Manage
to Send Lundy Over the
Jumps in Seventh Bound
The Stanford ball tossers bowed to
the multitude for the first time this
season yesterday at Recreation t'ark
in a Bpirite<l mix-up with the
fuat nine from yt. Mary's College.
Sales and TiowbricUe battled on
the slab for nine long innings. The
collegians slipped Lundy through in
the seventh round with two gone and
broke up a game that any fan would
have gone miles to see. Score, rftÂ»
Marys 1, Stanford 0.
The game did not finish as satisfac
torily as many would have liked to
see it. Stanford came up for its last
licks in the ninth, and Lewis, a substi
tute, led oft with a, bingle over third.
He was caught stealing second. Trow
bridge walked and Rooke lined one
over the right field fence, setting the
Stanford rooters wild with -
Rooke ran around the paths and
chased Trow bridge in ahead of him.
Then the St. Mary's tossers gathered
around Umpir* Tommy Leahy and
claimed the ball was a foul. Leahy
finally ruled that way, amid the pro
tests of the Cardinal tossers. Hooka
flew out at the next chance, and so
the game was lost to Stanford.
St. Mary's eased the only run over
in the seventh period, when Lundy
forced Rooney at second, making the
second out. He promptly stole and
went to third on an error by Sales.
Then Halloran came to the bat and
lined a fierce one at Rooke. The lat
ter fielded the ball behind the bag Ilka
a big leaguer, but threw It away at
first, thus letting in the only run of
a cracking good game of ball.
Both Ferguson and Sales pitched like
a couple of major league stars. Fer
guson winged twelve of the varsity to
the bench on strikes, while eleven of
the collegians succumbed to the shoots
of Sales. The score:

. which left Honolulu Friday for

: r KX). There are 142 tons of the
precious product in the steamship's
f'hold. Silk Is the star freight on the
trans-Pacific run and high and weighty
indeed must be the passenger to whom
the transportation companies offer the
consideration they show to this prod
uct of Oriental worms.
The New York importers of raw silk
pay cash for their purchases in the
Orient. This cash usually is borrowed,
as a shipment of silk represents more
money than most firms carry in the
cash drawer. One bale of raw silk is
worth about 5700. A bale weighs only
150 pounds and much of the raw silk
is bought by the ton. Upon money ad
vanced it is the custom on Wall street
to g~ure the interest every twelve
hours and when the amount borrowed
runs to the million mark the element
of time is an important consideration
â to the borrower. When a liner carry
ing raw silk comes into port those on
board the ship get the bales in readi
ness for discharging the moment the
steamer Is made last at her berth.
On the wharf a gang of stevedores

DERBY WINNER

tory Cleverly in the
Crescent City Classic
RAM'S HORN SCRATCHED
Heavy Rain ; Renders the
Track Too Muddy for
the Overnight Favorite
NEW ORLEANS, March 11. â j
Jockey Martin's perfect riding landed
Right Royal a length and a half in
front of his. field in the ninth Crescent ,
City Derby, worth $7165 to the winner,
this afternoon. A steady rain through
out the night and morning made a
heavy track and there was no sur- !
prise when Ram's Horn, to whom the
race had been conceded in fast going,
was withdrawn. Klttie Platt was also
scratched, leaving a field of six to face I
the starter.
Trapper was favorite at 7 to B In
the opening betting, with Right Royal
second choice at threes, King's Trophy
at fours. Jake Sanders at sixes and
the other two at long prices. Trapper
remained favorite to the end.
There was no delay at the post.
Aubuchon sent Jake Sanders to the
front at once. As they rounded the
turn Into the stretch Martin, whose
vigorous efforts had kept Right Royal
always within striking distance, sent
his mount to the front and began a
long and desperate drive. The early
pace told on Jake Sanders, and,
though he fought gamely, he was not
equal to the demand made upon him
and Right Royal passed him and won.
King's Trophy, a keen contender all
the way, came fast at the end and
was only beaten a neck for the place.
Results:
First race, five furlongs â Dishabille

They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or hamlet in the country which has not
cures by Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt.
Now, what does this mean to you, dear reader? If you are not what yoa ought to be. can yoa ask any
better proof to make you try it? Is there a â¢emedy which is as simple, as easy to use, as sure to cure, and as
cheap as Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt? I have not seen one. You must try it. Injustice to yourself, and
to those who look to you for their future happiness, try it now. Act this minute. Such a matter ought not
to be delayed. - . Â,,.,
It's as good for women as for men. Worn while you sleep it causes no trouble. Yoa feel the gentle,
glowing heat from it constantly, but no sting, no burning, as in old style belts.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
. Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, March 11. â Nervous uncertainty .
characterized trading in wheat at the opening. {
Sentiment, however, seemed Inclined to bear- i
ishness. Influenced mainly by lower prices at :
Liverpool. A factor that partially offset the
effect of the foreign weakness was the Gov- ,
ernment crop report Issued late yesterday. ;
This report was generally considered Quite
bullish, as Indicating that the wheat reserve
of the United States is 21,000,000 bushels : less
than a year ago. In spite of this fact opening
Quotations on May were off a shade to %<i?
%c at $1 18 to fl 13%. July was a shade
lower at %@%c higher at 924 cto 92% c Soon I
after the opening May was under considerable
selling pressure from longs and reacted to :
$1 11%. July eased off In sympathy to 92% 0. i
The market then developed moderate firmness, ;
July rallying to 93%0 and May to $1 184.
Much of the strength was due to the situation :
In the Northwest. Receipts to-day at Mm- i
neapolis and Duluth ; were ' comparatively !
small and there were intimations of a still !
further , reduction In arrivals. For a time the |
market held rather firm on small business.
Late in the day. however, a sharp decline in
Southwestern â¢ markets started an attempt : at
general Felling by commission houses here. 1
Buyers were few, owing apparently to the j
brilliant weather. The result was a quick 1
break In prices. May sold off to $1 11% and i
July to 91 %c. The market closed practically ;
at the lowest point of the day, final quota
tions on May being at $1 11% and ' July at
91HÂ®91%c. . Â. .. Â.,'. , y \7. nc
Despite the weakness of wheat and.th* bearÂ»
ish tenor of the Government crop report, -corn
held remarkably firm. May opened unchanged '
to Me higher at 48c to*4BÂ£c, sold up"td"4"S%c"' i
and closed at 48c. , , - ..
The break In wheat was the principal fac- ;
tor In the oat market. May closed at 314 c.
_. Provisions were steady on a small volume of
trading. May pork closed unchanged and- ribs
and lard were each up 2%0. Â*"_"! .' :

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
There was no further decline in Butter, but
the market continued weak, with holders more
than willing to meet buyers half way. Cheese
was easy at the decline already noted Eggs
advanced again and were extremely scarce
owing to the feverish buying for storage pur
poses | n the country, already mentioned,
â which has taken away from San Francisco a
large quantity of Eggs which It otherwise
would have received, and caused a practically
bare market here. This Is something unheard
of at this time of the year. Prices have been
run up so high that storing at them is very
hazardous and some houses have already
ceased buying in consequence.
Receipts were 53,600 lbs Butter 1147 cases

scarcity of strictly fancy fruit, the bulk of
the offerings being standards and mostly of
poor quality. Prices were nominally un
changed. Like Oranges, the other Citrus fruits
were quiet. Apples were weak and the cook

Spiers, George H. Wallis.
President Rudolph J. Taussig made
his report for the year. It is in part
as follows:
To the Members of the Mechanics* In
stitute:
Before proceeding with the annual
statement of the condition of the
affairs of the Mechanics' Institute it
seems especially appropriate to make
prominent mention of the fact that the
institute has now completed the fiftieth
year of its existence and of its useful
ness.
- We are planning to make our cele
bration coincident with the post-con
ference meeting of the American Li
brary Association, which is expected to
take place in San Francisco during the
coming summer. The American Li
brary Association meets in Portland
- this year for its annual conference and
according to its usual custom cf hold
ing post-conference meetings in places
of interest, to which excursions are
made.
The San Francisco Chapter of the
American Institute of Bank Clerks has
S recently affiliated with us, adding one
hundred and fifty new names to our
membership. As they are especially
interested in the study of finance and
, as we are endeavoring to develop that
branch of our library devoted to com
merce, thiV affiliation will undoubtedly
be mutually advantageous.
In connection with this it is our in
tention to inaugurate a course of lec
tures upon economics, and Professor H.
Horse Stephens, who has kindly taken
charge of our lectures, is making the
necessary arrangements.
There is no reason why the Me
chanics' Institute should not, with its
splendid endow:- nt, eventually estab
lish what might be called a ' popular
university. That would give such of
our members who may have neither
th* time nor the opportunity of attend
ing a regular university the benefit of
university lectures.
Considerable improvement has been
made in our library building, which it
is hoped will add to the comfort of the
members, and earnest endeavors are
also being made to improve the effici
ency of the library service. A number
of assistants have been employed for
more than a year to catalogue the en
tire library and the work is now near
ing completion. The fiction catalogue
was installed some time ago.
The total receipts for the fiscal year
just ended were about $46,400, while the
bills incurred amounted to about $47 -
*00 This would Indicate an apparent
deficit. of $1500, which, however, is not
â¢ correct. We should deduct from the
amount of bills Incurred during the
year at least one-half and probably
one-third of the amount spent for lino
leum, catalogue cases and furniture.
The net income from thÂ« Pavilion
block during the past year has been
about $11,500, a slight Increase over the '
preceding year. We deem the Pavilion
block an endowment for the institute
which ought to be held as an invest
ment, as It would be difficult to find a
safer or a better one.
President -Taussig spoke of the pro
posed erection of a building at Hayes
and Polk streets as a good Investment
and urged the members to actively
work for â¢ the bringing â¢of exhibits to
the pavilion from Portland at the close
of the Lewis and Clark Exposition .in
ISO 6.
At the conclusion .of the regular
meeting the board of trustees met and
ekcted the following officers for â  the ;
ensuing fiscal year: President, Rudolph
J. Taussig; vice president, George H.
Wallis; corresponding secretary, James ;
H. Lyons; recording secretary, James
G. Spaulding. .Joseph M. Cumming re
mains in "his., position as secretary.
The office of treasurer was hotly con
tested for by the Central Trust Com
pany end the Bank of California, with
ihe result as ret undetermined."

PAVICICH TALKS
TO COUNTRYMEN
Noted Slavonic Statesman
Is Greeted by a Large
Audience at Lyric Hall
One of the most important events
in years In the , local Slavonic colony
was the lecture fiven by Dr. A. Tresich
Pavicich, the noted student and states
man, at Lyric Hall last night. Dr.
Pavicich only recently arrived In this
city a,nd last night he was formally
introduced to his countrymen who
make San Francisco their home.
The doctor delivered his lecture in
the Slavonic tongue and he was in
tensely listened to by a crowded house.
He spoke on the condition of affairs
and the people in the Slavonic Balkan
â¢tates and of their fight for their
rights. He told of his travels in vari
ous lands and cited many interesting
episodes of his wanderings.
Dr. Pavicich is a great scholar and
an interesting speaker. He is yet a
young man, tall, well . built and pos
sessing the appearance of a student.
He expressed himself as delighted with
the reception given to him by his fel
low countrymen and paid a special
tilbute to the United Slavonic Societies
of this city and Oakland, under whose
auspices he delivered his lecture.
The doctor has long been a promi
nent man of affairs in his native land.
He holds the position of doctor of phil
osophy in one of the leading educa
tional institutions there. He is also
a member of the Chatnber of Deputies
frcm Dalmatia and during the last
ftw years has made an enviable rec
ord us a statesman and champion of
the cause of the oppressed people.
Dr. Pavicich I] also a man of great
literary genius. He is the author of
more than 300 works that are widely
read in the Slavonic tongne, his poems
especially gaining him prominence
throughout Europe. He has trans
lated many works from French and
German into his native language and
for a number of years has been the
editor of Jadran, a leading Slavonic
journal.
After the distinguished lecturer had
concluded his speech he was given a
reception by the United Slavonic So
cieties of this city and Oakland. All
