TACOMA. Nov. 4.â The Department
of Commerce and Labor has promised
to investigate the car shortage in the
Northwest, and circulars have been dis
tributed by O. P. Austin, Chief of the
Bureau of Interstate Commerce and
Labor at Washington, to commercial
organizations in Portland, Tacdma and
other Northwestern cities. In these
circulars it is inferred that the depart
ment Intends to look into the question
thoroughly and then take such steps as
are necessary to remedy the situation.
The lumbermen claim that the rail
roads are not making adequate prepa
rations for handling the increasing
traffic resulting from the lumber, wheat
and fruit industries. They point out
that the shipment East of part of the
wheat crop will require more cars than
usual, leaving, fewer in consequence
for lumber, despite the fact that the
lumber interests are already Buffering
from car shortage.
It is declared that the lumber indus
try is furnishing one- third of the gross
earnings of the Northern Pacific. Great
Northern and the Oregon Railroad and
Navigation railroads, but that these
roads have done nothing toward in
creasing their car equipment except
to r/archase Â£50 box cars.
The appeal of the lumbermen states
that the 850 cars are supposed to take
care, of 10.090 carloads Â«f wheat to be
moved to the East and the increase of
800 carloads of lumber and shingles
over last year's shipments, not to men
tion the natural increase in business
incidental to the growth of the Pacific
Northwest.

INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. ; 4.âBroken
hearted, disappointed, their minds be
wildered as to what course to pursue,
four joung women in high social circles
in four cities are in tears because of
the actions of dashing and handsome
Edward H. Lane of New York, brother
of Dr. Thomas Lane, surgeon at Belle
vue Hospital, in marrying all four in
less than four weeks.
Lanedid It, he -said,' because they
were. 'so "fetching" and because he
might want to,write a novel sometime,
and '^ this.- would -/furnish- a- good, plot.
Lane first showed up* in Cincinnati on
a visit to; relatives,. in that place. ,' He
wooed and In two day's won and mar
ried Miss Minnie Veihling of that city.
He then came to Indianapolis, where
he met Mrs. Minnie Wilson, a dashing
young woman. He wrote to wife No. 1
at Cincinnati that he was detained here
on business. The business was his mar
riage to Mrs. Wilson. He spent two days
with her, showered gifts on her, left her
money and said he had to go to Marion,
Ind. -r s '5r;-- '-':Â¦'Â¦ -:; v -
There he met Mrs. Lula Young Brush
wieler, a divorced young woman of 22
years, of striking beauty- He wooed
and won her, wrote wives Nos. 1 and 2
that he was detained In Marion ,on
business and married again after an
elopement last Tuesday. "oV"
| On went the gay Lothario to Logans
port, Ind., where to-day he was mar
ried for the fourth time. The ceremony
was scarcely over when wives Nos. 2
and 3 arrived. No. 2 had gone to Marion
to look up Lane, and No. 3 had been
turned out of her mother's home. She
went to Logansport and had Lane ar
rested, charged with bigamy. He told
his own story, saying:
"Those deaf girls were so . fetching
that I couldn't resist. I made love, of
course, but they accepted my protesta
tions and two of the whole number
actually proposed marriage themselves
rather than have me go away without
them. I had to be game. . I know this is
a serious lark and my folks in New
York will be awfully shocked, but they
can get me out of it."

On last Thursday night Dr.'Gebhardt,
a deutipt, was slain : in his: office. The
murclorer beat hlm" t 'to deathwlth a
hammer and stabbed him twenty times.

whose office is underneath tha,t > of -the

up to the transom/and there "saw the
murderer finishings his victim.- Brooks
ran down- to the street and gave the
alarm. 4
In the meantime the murderer es
caped! 'Robbery was not the motive,
for Dr. Gebhardt'a safe was open and a
large sum oj money untouched.^Neither
was the money on his person- or his
watch taken. When an investigation
was begun a handkerchief bearing the
initials 'G. R. K. was found saturated
with blood. Witnesses asserted that
they had seen Dr. Koch passing into
Dr. Gebhardt's office five minutes before
the murder is said to have been com
mitted. On the strength of this he was
put through a rigid examination and
satisfied his inquisitors by proving an
alibi. When the funeral of his busi
ness rival occurred to-day Dr. Koch
sang !n the choir. .
Dr. Koch is 24 years old and has
been practicing /dentistry, here for
about one year. The mystery surround
ing the death of Gebhardt remains un
solved, as Brooks has failed to identify

WASHINGTON, Nov. 4.â President Roosevelt to-night made the following signed state
ment to 'the American people in answer to the charges made against himself and Mr. Cortelyou in
public speeches by Mr. Parker, Democratic candidate for the Presidency:
"White House, Washington. Nor. 4.
"Certain slanderous accusations as to Mr. Cortelyou and myself have been repeated time and
again by Judge Parker, the candidate of his party for the office of President. He neither has pro
duced nor can produce any proof of the truth of the charges, yet he lias "not withdrawn them, and
as his position 'gives., them wide currency I speak now lest the silence of self-respect be misunder
stood. Mr. Parker's charges are, in effect, that the President of the United States and Mr. Cortel-
you, formerly Mr. Cleveland's executive clerk, then Mr. 'McKinleys and my secretary, then Sec
retary of Commerce and Labor and- now chairman of the Republican National Committee, have
been in a conspiracy to blackmail the corporations, Mr. Cortelyou using his knowledge gained
while he was Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Labor to extort money from the
corporations, and I, the President, having appointed him for this special purpose. The gravamen of
these charges lies in the. assertion that the corporations have been blackmailed into contribut
ing.and in the implication, which in one or two of Mr. Parker's speeches has taken the form prac
tically of an assertion., that they have been promised certain immunities or favors, or have been as
sured that they would receive some kind of improper consideration in view of their contributions.
"That contributions have been made to the Republican committee, as contributions have
been made to the Democratic committee, is not the question at issue.
NOT A PARTICLE OF TRUTH IN PARKER'S STATEMENT.
- "Mr. Parkers assertion is, in effect, that such contributions have been made for improoer
motives; either in consequence of threats or in consequence pf improper promises, direct or indi
rection the part of recipients". .Mr. Parker knenys best whether this is true 'of the contributions
to "his campaign '-'fund*- Which, have come" through his trusted friends and advisers, who represent the
great corporate interests that 'stand behind him. But there is not the particle of truth in the state
ment as regards anything that has gone on in the management of the Republican campaign. Mr.
Parker's accusations against Mr. Cortelyou and "myself are monstrous* If true they would brand
both of us forever with infamy, and for inasmuch. as they are false, heavy must be the condemna
tion of the man making them. \
"I chose Mr. Cortelyou as* chairman of the national committee after having failed successive
ly to persuade Elihu Root, W. Murray Crane and Â¦.Cornelius ' N: Bliss to accept the position. I chose
him with extreme reluctance, because I could ill spare him from the Cabinet. But I felt that he
possessed the high integrity which I demanded in the man who was to manage my campaign. I am
content that Mr. Parker or I should be judged by the public on the characters of the two men whom
we chose to manage our campaigns â he by the character of his nominee, Thomas Taggart, and I
by the character of Mr. Cortelyou.
PAliKER GUILTY OF MOXSTKOU S FALSEHOODS;
"The assertion that Mr. Cortelyou had any knowledge gained : while in any official position
whereby he was enabled to secure and did secure any contributions from any corporation is a false^.
hood. The assertion that there has been any blackmail, direct or indirect, by Mr. Cortelyou or by
me is a falsehood. The assertion that there has been made in behalf of and by authorization of Mr.
Cortelyou or by any one else, any pledge or promise, or that there has been any understanding
as to future, immunities or benefits in recognition of any contribution from any source, is a wick
ed falsehood.
"That Mr. Parker should desire to avoid the discussion of principles I can well understand,
for it is but the bare truth to say that he has not attacked us on any matter of principle or upon
any action of the Government save after first misstating that principle or that action. But I cannot
understand how any honorable man, a candidate for the highest office in the gift of the people, can
take refuge not merely in personalities, but irr such, base and unworthy personalities.
ASKS ALl* HONEST MEN TO COMPARE ADMINISTRATIONS.
"If I deemed it necessary to support my flat denial by any evidence I would ask all men of
common se/ise to ponder well what has been done in this campaign by Mr. Cortelyou and to com
'pare it with what Mr. Parker himself did when he was managing Mr. Hill's campaign for Governor,
and to compare what has been done as regards the great corporations and money interests in this ad
ministration with what was done under tHe last Democratic administration while Mr. Olney was At
torney General; I would ask all honest men whether they seriously deem it possible that the course
this administration has taken in. every matter, from the Northern Securities suit to the settlement of
the anthracite coal strike, is compatible with any theory of public behavior save the theory of doing
exact justice to all men without fear and without favoritism; I would ask all honest and fair-minded
men to remember that the agents through whom I have worked 'are Mr. Knox and Mr. Moody in
the Department of Justice, Mr. Cortelyou in the Department of Commerce and Labor and Mr. Gar
field in the Bureau of Corporations, and that no such act of infamy as Mr. Parker charges could
have been done without all these men being parties to it.
"The statements. made by Mr. Parker are unqualifiedly and atrociously- false. As Mr. Cor
telyou has said to me more than once during this campaign, if elected I shall go into the Presidency
unhampered by any pledge, promise or understanding of any kind, save my promise.made openly to
the American people that; so far as in my power lies, I shall see to it that every man rias a square
deal; no less and no more. -v ,v "THEODORE ROOSEVELT."

for Superior Judge, Kerrigan and
Burchard, spoke and were ; greeted
warmly, especially Kerrigan. The
speakers urged the voters to cast their

the voters of the Thirty-first Assembly
Distriot was held last evening. The
chief speaker was former Congressman
Julius Kahn, Republican candidate for
re-election in the Fourth Congressional

thusiastic. In speaking of it after the

Several voters from the Fourth Pre
cinct of the Thirty-ninth^ Assembly
District, together with Fairfax H.
Wheelan of the Merchants' Associa
tion, appeared . last night before the
J?card of Election Commissioners to
show why W. J. Foster, an election in
spector, should be dismissed.- Mr.
Hazel testified that Foster was an em
ploye of the United States Government
and therefore disqualified from serv
ing.
Fairfax Wheelan then testified that
Fester, while an election officer of the
Fourth Precinct at the last primary
election, was present when Adolph
Steffens, whom Foster knew, voted the
name of "another, man and that Foster
made' no protest.- -
In reply Foster' said that he was
sick on election day and away from
the voting booth several times. - He
added that he- saw no illegal voting.
The question resolved 4 itself' into the
necessity of believing Mr. Wheelan or
Mr. Foster and the board decided to
giye the city the benefit of the doubt.
It removed Foster oo the ground that
he is a Government employe.
Regarding the communication from
th<v Fire Commissioners relating to the
complaint of the firemen "of Engine
Company 4 -that' they were falsely ac
cused of being ballot-box stufifers, the
Election Board decided that its former
letter to the Merchants' Association
relating" to the City and County Hos
pital registrations covered the- case.
The board passed a resolution, how
ever, "condemning the policy of any

ATTACK S THE CO3IBIXATIOXS.
In the contest of twenty years ago the tariff
then existing was condemned because In and of
Itself, without accomplices or vicious asso
ciates, it was guilty of despoiling our people in
their homes. Trusts and combinations did not
then appear as Its confederates. If they ex
isted at all. they were Infant Industries, too
few and too young to be mentioned in the plat
form of either of -the great political parties,
and too newly born to be the companions of
such other infant industries as, . though still
unweaned, Â¦ had actually grown gray at the
breasts. of sinfully Indulgent tariff protection.
Â¦ The multiplication of this new race of infant
Industries soon grew to be wonderfully In ex/
cess of all .other birth rate records. In 18SS
they had attracted attention er/ough to be de
nounced on both party platforms. The pre
cocity of these Infant prodigies ran far ahead
of the most exaggerated Imagination of parent
al ; pride. : Before they were a day old - they
recognized in the policy of high protection the
way to growth and strength and wealth.
Though it is sometimes now said that the tariff
has nothing to do with trusts, Mr. Havemeyer,
the most competent of all men to give expert
testimony on the subject, has declared "the
tariff is the mother of trusts,'.' and the trusts
themselves were precocious enough to know
this at the beginning of their Infantile exist
ence. Â¦ .
It was twenty, years ago almost to a day.that
I appeared before a Newark audience charged
with the responsibility of my party's Presiden
tial candidacy. The Democratic platform in
that campaign denounced the Republican party
for having failed to relieve the people from
crushing war taxes and declared that unnecea
sary taxation was unjust taxaTTon. TSTs plat
form also promised that. If entrusted with the
control of the Government, "the Democracy
would purify the administration from corrup
tion, restore economy, revive respect for law
and revise the tariff in a split of fairness to all
Interests." â ~VÂ£3EE&%i
CONDEMNS HIGH TARIFF.
The remarks of the speaker upon the
needs of a conservative Government
were received with an outburst almost
equal to' that at Mr. Cleveland's en
trance Into the hall, and when he con
cluded with this appeal "that the
American people may be aroused to
their sense of justice by these senti
ments," the audience was on its feet,
while at the last words of the speaker
rallying his hearers to the support of
"that noble, than manly standard
"that_ noble, that manly standard
siasm seemed to gain renewed strength.
Mr. Cleveland's speech follows:; .
, During his speech Mr. Cleveland was
interrupted by remarks of approval
from enthusiastic listeners and on sev
eral occasions when he departed from
his text to impress upon his hearers
some point upon State issues, the dem
onstration broke out afresh and con
tinued for several minutes.
On Mr. Cleveland's appearance on the
platform cheer after cheer rolled from
one end of the armory to the other.
Men stood on chairs twirling hats on
canes, women/ waved handkerchiefs and
clapped their hands, while patriotic
airs from a band could not be heard.
For ten minutes the former President
stood bowing and smiling in acknowl
edgment and repeatedly attempted to
address the- crowd. A half-way quiet
Avaa then* restored and the speech was
begfun, only to be interrupted by an
other outburst that lasted for three
minutes more. It was only when the
audience was drowned Into silence by
the hisses of those desirous of hearing
the former President that Mr. Cleve
land could go on.
This was Mr. Cleveland's first public
appearance in this campaign in his own
State. ' â¢??-, ,^~->'
NEWARK, N. J., Nov. 4.- With a tri
bute to the strength and er. 'Midiaaia of
the first voter, former Presii ant GroVer
Cleveland' in Newark > to-night began
his' second speech of the pr^rxnt carfl
paign. He waited ten minules for a
cessation of the cheering anfi noise that
his appearance brought forth, and for
thirty-five minutes after he began h'is
address 8000 persons, crowded together
on the t^nbark of a riding academy,
alternately listened and cheered. The
occasion was the closing Democratic
rally of the campaign, a rally under
the. auspices of a club of "first voters."
Mr. Cleveland was the permanent
chairman.
Following ' Mr. Clveland, former
Comptroller of the Currency James H.
Eckles of Chicago addressed the meet
ing.
Equity before the law 'and equal oppor
tunity for all define cardinal Democratic doc
trine. Under this flag â we fight the battle of
the people. We seek to invest them again
with the eauallty which la . their tight by
virtue of American' citizenship and to restore
to them equal opportunity, r whictÂ» is the right
of American manhood. Â¦ . .
Our party makes no warfare upon the rich
nor upon any legitimate enterprises. Its def
inition of American citizenship Is broad
enough and just enough to embrace
all people â the . rich I and â¢ the. poor .alike
â and all corporations and associations of
capital, legitimately engaged in legitimate
business, but it Insists that the Government
should in no way and by no device or abuse of
its functions be accessory â¢ to the creation of
vast combinations of industrial and business
enterprises whose Inevitable tendencies are
to control wrongfully the cost of our people's
living and strangle. independent and individual
business effort.
Democracy, Mr. Cleveland said, Is
conservative, and a conservative Gov
ernment was never more needed than
now. Democracy insists that the con
stitution should be the chart and con
stant guide of national conduct; and
never was a renewal of obedience to
constitutional commands more neces
sary. The Democratic party regards
tariff charges as a tax upon the peo
ple justified only by the necessity of
providing v for the expenses of their
Government; and It holds that, like all
other taxes, these charges should be
as equitably distributed as possible. It
condemns tariff legislation for the sole
purpose of protection as an unavoida
ble source of inequality and favoritism
and as promotlve of oppressive indus
trial combinations; and so far as
tariff duties imposed for revenue may
increditably result in some degree of
protection, it insists that this should
he so arranged as to best subserve the
general welfare. -: :*; < *- :
Continuing, Cleveland said:
Have our people been so milled by tha
glamor of unsound prosperity and eo deceived
by the pretense that an exorbitant protective
tariff In some mysterious . way assures their
happiness and easy existence that they arÂ»
willing to accept a blind faith In a prosper
ity which thÂ« mosses of our countrymen
neither see nor feel, as against the tangible
evidence supplied by increased cost of every
necessity of life, enforced self-denial In every
home and everywhere curtailed opportunity for
remunerative employment?
Has the pressure of trusts and monopolies
become so familiar and have their pretense of
benevolent purpoaes so deluded our people that
they are willing abjectly to surrender their
claims to equality before the law and. to sup
port a policy which to their undoing makes
these aggregations of riches and power mow
rich and powerful? Have tha plain people of
our land â Independent, proud Americans â Â»o
degenerated that they do not resent the hu
miliating suggestion that those, made rich
through unjust favoritism will care for them,
and are they content to rely on the tender
mercies of such intermediaries as these, in
stead of the direct consideration . due them
from their Government? Have our . people
reached such a state of listless indifference
that they see nothing wrong in a scheme of
tariff protection which supplies to foreign con
sumers articles of necessary use which are
the work of American hands and American
ingenuity at a cheaper rate than they can
be purchased by American citizens? Are they
willing for the sake of continuing this dis
crimination against themselves to perpetuate
the policy which burdens them with protective
tariff taxation?
FIGHTING BATTLE OF PEOPLE.
I will not believe that my countrymen are
either willfully reckless. of their safety
or heedless ' of "> their : duty ' of citizenship or
insensible to their rights ami' Interests;- â¢-* but
whether they will hear or whether they will
forbear I cannot ' refrain from urging " upon
them the especial necessity at this time of
sober reflection, and exhorting -them to a du
tiful review of our nation's establishment, tha
character of , its-- mission and its political
plight. If. this is honestly undertaken and if
the exigencies of the hour are clearly seen
and patriotically met. I shall not fear for the
result.
those liuur days, and the rate of tariff
taxation which the Democracy then
tcad^mred as yielding more than suffl
clsnt revenue for ( Government needs
â¢\ri>- moderate us compared with pres
er.t taxations.
j TAliiJT TAXATION INCREASE.
Mr. Cleveland, continuing, said:
I come again after twenty years. The rate
of tariff taxation has Increased by one-fourth,
the expenditure of the Government has more
than double 1; and hundreds of industrial trusts
and combinations, the vicious progeny of ex
treme tariff protection, openly or stealthily
search the pockets of our people. Again I use
my word* of twenty years ago. "The right of
the Government to exact tribute from thÂ«
citizen is limited by Its exact necessities; and ,
every ' cent taken from the people beyond that
required for their protection by the Govern
ment Is no better than robbery."
A3 I repeat those words the question is In my
mind whether the startling changes we con
template will add force and emphasis to this
sentiment which in 16S4 was indorsed by our
countrymen, or whether with these changes
another of deeper and sadder significance has
taken place In our people's modes of thought
and their conceptions of American sturdlnesa
of citizenship; has the steady growth of public
extravagance been so artfully concealed by
glorification of their country's progress that
they no longer consider public frugality as a
fundamental element in governmental duty
which they cannot remit either with safety to
our institutions or Justice to their own best
Interests? .. .->Â¦Â¦- "â¢ ; -"-":
statement says that the committee has
resolved to take such steps aa may be
necessary to punish all violations of
the election law that may be brought
to its attention and that it will follow
up all such cases whatever the result
of the election may be.
The Bell followers have winced and
crouched under the telling force of
Dozier's arraignment of Bell's pre
tended claims of Congressional accom
plishments. His logic, his magnetic
eloquence and his clear and concise
presentation of facts, fortified by the
absolute and exact record in each In
stance, have fully demonstrated that
Bell is a false alarm, who has been
sailing under stolen colorsâ Just as
Congressman McLachlan charged him
with doing. ;!,".
The committee is informed from Red
ding that any one doubting the absolute
falsity of the charges made, by the
Redding Free Press can satisfy his
mind and settle his doubts by com
municating with Judge Edward Swee
ney, former Judge of the Superior
Court of Shasta. County and now one
of the Presidential Electors on the Re
publican ticket in this campaign, whose
residence is in Redding. Judge Swee
ney Is well known in this* State and
4ias an enviable reputation : and record.
To illustrate the straits in which
Bell's friends are and the character of
-fcampaign which is being conducted in
his behalf, the Republican State Â¦Com
mittee directs attention to the attack
which is being made on Thomas B.
Dozier, District Attorney of Shasta
County, who has been speaking in the
Second Congressional District of Cali
fornia In behalf of the Republican
party and particularly advocating the
elfction of Duncan E. McKiniay. Some
time ago the Redding Free Press, pub
lished by F. il. Swasey, a pretended
Republican and now Register of the
local Land Office at Redding, holding
such position under a Republican ad
ministration, made an attack on Mr.
Dozkr concerning a bridge matter
which came before the Board of Su
pervisors of Sha.via .County. \ This per
sonal attack was well and notoriously
known to have been actuated and im
pelled by personal malice and virxii'j
tivencss upon the part of Swasey.
When the charges were made 2>ir.
Dozier, at the next session of the Be.iru
of Supervisors, demanded an Inv< â¢.â¢-tl
gution, which clearly and unequivoc \lly
exonerated him and proved bey j
question that the onslaught of Swi <Â¦
was the exhibition of personal sp â¢. r
and malice. Although this matter ..',
curred some time ago, in the last f.iur
days and during the absence of Sir.
Dazier, Swasey, inspired by a Democrat
who has notoriously controlled the F: Â«*.-
Press, has been rehashing these ex
ploded charges against Dozier in r.is
newspaper, and copies of the same are
being mailed and sent to the various
newspapers in the Second Congressional
District with the hope of pulling duwn
the good work done by Dozier In behalf
of McKinlay.

REFUTES ATTACK.
At Petaluma Thursday night Bell re
newed his attack on Governor Pardee.
The Republican State Central Com
mittee is informed that the .bellicose
Congressman's tirade against the Gov
ernor was so vehement that men in
the audience who had not fully deter
mined how they should vote next
Tuesday resolved to support Duncan
K'. McKinlay. the able and dignified
CKOWDS CHEEK KAHX.
Kahn did not enter the hall till
after the meeting had opened and the
speaking had to be stayed while the
assemblage gave him a cordial greet
ing, including several rounds of cheers.
When it came his turn on the plat
form he got another ovation. .;'".
Major Kyle and Benjamin I* Mc-
Kinley addressed the meeting and the
issues of the campaign were happily
and thoroughly presented. The Co
lumbia Quartet interspersed the pro
gramme with singing 'and a band lent
its aid to the arousing of enthusiasm.
gleeful note of triumph was in the air.
George B. Keane, candidate for State
Senator; George A. McGowan, for As-,
semblyman, and Julius Kahn, for Con-,
gress, were particularly the subjects
of demonstrations and it was ap
parent that their popularity in the
Forty-second is strong. v .
E. G. Knapp called the assemblage
to order and introduced Curry as the
chairman. The Secretary of State
spoke briefly of his confidence of a
sweeping Republican victory and then
Introduced McGowan. The young
orator acquitted himself very accept
ably to his hearers. There was a repe
tition of the lusty cheers when Keane
was presented and his speech was fre
quently interrupted by applause.. * ,*.-v
Mr. Macathur in his introductory re
marks deplored the policy of militarism
which he ascribed to Roosevelt and the
Republican party, and said that if this
policy was not curbed, it would inevi
tably lead to a war that would plunge
the whole nation into blood and tears.
This reapplied quotation from Inger
soll on was followed by 'â¢. a
new version of history, with Frank tJ.
Sullivan as the author. Mr. Sullivan
said that at the time of Lincoln the Re
publican party was the minority party;
that it was Democrats that officered
the army of the Union, and that it was
the Democratic party that gave the ne
gro his liberty. -
Then Sullivan said he was convinced
that the question of the tariff had noth
ing to do with the prosperity of the
country. His contention is established,
he said, by the fact that the most pros
perous time this nation ever knew was
during ' the- period from 1801 -to 1861,
when, according to Sullivan's historical
discoveries, free ~ trade prevailed. .' In
conclusion Sullivan called upon the au
dience to support Congressional Nomi
nees Livernash and Wynn.
Congressman Livernash had not. yet
arrived \ when Sullivan concluded his
speech, aiÂ»d William Greeley, who ad
vocated the cause of Joseph M.- Plunk -
ett. Democratic nominee for the. Senate
in the Seventeenth District; Charles A.
SweJgert and S. B. Nolan, candidate for
the Assembly jn the Twenty-eighth
District,* were called upon to address
the audience. They concluded with Con
gressman Livernash still absent, so
Walter Macarthur again stepped into
the breach and spoke on behalf of the
candidacy of Congressmen Livernash
and Wynn. They should be supported,
he said, because they had kept the
faith, because they were intelligent and
honest, were men of the people that
could be trusted to remain loyal to the
people in every battle that might arise
in the halls of Congress.
Mr. Livernash arrived at the hall at
this point and received'ah enthusiastic
welcome. . After discussing national is
sues for a t|me he turned his attention
to local conditions, which he said at
the moment were overshadowing the
national questions in the interest of San
Franciscans. He said he had hoped
that the present campaign would be \ a
clean one, different from the last, which
drew him with its indecency into. the
valley of desperation, but he had found
that the same condition must be faced
again. He then attacked the Citizens'
Alliance for its opposition of his can
didacy and in conclusion said:
"I want to tell you union men here
that it is not me that the Citizens' Al
liance opposes, it is you and the prin
ciples that you stand for. Be on your
guard lest it be loo late when the fight
that is now in preparation opens against
you."
The Democratic State Central Com
mittee's campaign has closed in San

"We all knew him and we all recog

standing on a log at the edge of the
water. "We spoke to him, when he
plunged into the river and disappeared.
At the moment we did not think it
strange that there was no splash, but
when we . ran down and found there
was no log, we became scared. We
afterward learned that we were on the
exact spot where Fodesch's shoes were
found and where his tracks led to the
water." .
OMAHA. Nov. 4.â Four reputable cit
izens, who camped on the banks of the
Missouri last night, are ready to take
oath that they saw the ghost of E-
Fodesch, a wealthy â¢ cigarmaker, who
committed suicide by Jumping into the
water at the same spot just one year
ago. The party consisted of H. H. Mar
tens, proprietor of the Hotel Martens;
his son, Joseph, and two friends. They
had been fishing . from Martens*
naphtha launch during the day and at
night anchored the boat and pitched
their tent on the bank.
At midnight all were suddenly awak
ened. Looking from their tent all saw
the figure of a man standing by the
boat. They rushed out ready to
shoot, thinking some one intended to
steal their launch. Before them, they
all declare, stood Fodesch.
Cruelty was alleged as the ground of
divorce and In , support of her com
plaint Mrs. Griffith told from the wit
ness stand the story of the shooting.
The crime was committed at the Hotel
Arcadia, at Santa Monica. GriSth
fired twice at his wife, one bullet de
stroying one of her eyes. To escape
him she leaped from a window and in
the fall fractured her arm and colla^
bone. After hearing her story Judge
Allen asked If there had been .any
provocation.
"Not the slightest -In the world." she
replied. "It was a deliberate act."
. The decree was granted and the cus
tody of the only child given to the
mother.
Griffith was convicted of assault
with a deadly weapon and sentenced to
two years in San Quentin and fined
$3000, the maximum penalty. His case
Is before the Supreme Court.

The Daily Telegraph's correspondent
at Chefu learns that the Japanese
are seeking to compel the Russian fleet
to quit the harbor and that Vice Ad

If it is effected, the correspondent adds,
the Japanese will settle down to a
winter sieje.
LONDON, Nov. 5.â Conflicting re
ports emanate from Chefu regarding
tha result of the latest assault on Port
Arthur- Bennett Burleigh of the paily
Telegraph, who passed the fortress in
a steamer, says that all was quiet at S
o'clock Friday morning, and there were
no signs of firing or of any movement.
His steamer was thrice chased and
boarded by Japanese within a brief
period, the Japanese forbidding any
navigation within twenty miles of Port
Arthur.
No Signs of Firing or of Any Move

The writer enters into a detailed

of them was anywhere in touch with
the battleships and cruisers. The night

m. â St. Petersburg newspapers and
their correspondents have _ been unre

Captain Claddo and his fellow officers
from the Baltic squadron, who, how
ever, have steadfastly refused to talk
for publication.
The Novoe Vremya this morning
prints a long letter, dated Vigo, Oc
tober 2S, and credited to a member of
the Baltic squadron, containing a sum
mary of events leading up to the firing
upon the British trawlers and the in
cidents of the night of October 21. The
letter says that Admiral Rojestvensky
and the Admiralty, before the sailing
c-f the squadron., received from secret
agents a mass of information regard
ing the plans and whereabouts of Jap
anese boatsÂ»in European waters. The
letter says:
"The Japanese had torpedo boats in
the Norwegian fjords and also pur
chased a number cf fishing vessels at
Hamburg, Hull, Southampton and
Christiania. The Russians , also pur
chased a number c-f fishers and small
steamers for scouting duty. .
"The Russian Government warned
the governments of Germany, Den
mark and Great Britain of the inform
ation in its possession and asked that
special precautions be taken to keep
the track of the squadron clear of com
mercial vessels. Germany and Den
mark both responded. Denmark sent
a warship with the squadron and
warned off a number of fishermen and
coasting craft. Before leaving Skagen,
Admiral Rojestvensky received further
specific information stating 1 that four
Japanese torpedo-boats, accompanied
by a collier, were waiting west of Cape
Skagen. The Baltic squadron left in
the merning and the Japanese, in order
to make a nisht attack, were obliged
to follow and catch up with the war
ships in the North Sea."
The letter says that Admiral Rojest
vensky was detained outside of Brest
to wait for orders and then proceeded
to Vigo. . o/Li^.:;
The Russian ships did not stop either
to assist or to inquire if assistance were
needed. Such proceeding at night time,

abouts by latitude and longitude, es
pecially where the battleships Orel and
Kniaz Souvaroff were. These messages
excited suspicion and the flagship re
plied, asking the names- and the num
ber in the family of a certain officer on
beard the Kamtchatka. Thereupon the
messages stopped. It was 12:65 o'clock
that night, the writer continues, when
the squadron saw a green flare, such
a3 Is used by vessels in distress, evi
dently a signal asking the squadron to
stop and assist; Soon, thereafter a
searchlight was thrown on the Russian
vessels by a vessel supposed to be ac
companying the Japanese torpedo
bcats. This made the squadron a plain
target for attack.
At the same time the Russians made
out the forms of two torpedo-boats in
the darkness to one side. Searchlights
were immediately thrown from the
squadron on the strange torpedo-boats,
and they instantly darted ahead at full
speed. The squadron opened fire and
the boats came under the guns of the
Orel, Kniaz Souvaroff and the Borodino.
It is thought that one was sunk. Mean
time the squadron got entangled with
the trawler fleet, which was displaying
no lights, flags or signals. Admiral Ro
jestvensky.. however. , de6i>ite the fact
that some of them were close enough
to do serious damage had they had evil
intentions, signaled*' the squadron to
stop firing. Some of the trawlers were
then close under the bows of the squad
ron.

The bertor clss* of drujrjnsta, everywhere, are men of scientific attainments and high integrity,
who devotes their lives to the welfare oi their fellow men in supplying the best of remedies and
purest medicinal agents of knowD value, in accordance with physicians* prescriptions and
scientific formula. Druggists of the better class manufacture many excellent remedies, but
always under original or officinal names and they never sell false brands, or imitation medicines.
They are the men to deal with when in need of anything in their line, which usually includes
all standard remedies and corresponding adjuncts of a first-clas3 pharmacy and the finest and
best of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and remedial appliances.
The earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which arises from a knowledge of the benefits
conferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest
reward for long years of study and many hours of daily toil. They all know that Syrup of
Fig3 13 an excellent laxative remedy and that it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they
are selling many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the choicest
remedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine article bearing the full
name of tha Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of every package.
They know that in cases of cold3 and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation and
of weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowels, arising from irregular habits, indigestion, or
over-eating, that there is no other remedy so pleasant, prompt and beneficiaMn its effects aa
Syrup of Figs, and they are glad to sell it because it gives universal satisfaction. _
Owing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and the
immense demand for it, imitations have been made, tried and condemned, but there are
individual druggists to be found, hers and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles
of the profession and whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not hesitate
to recommend and try to sell the imitations in order to make a larger profit Such preparations
sometimes have the name â " Syrup of Fig3 w â or "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never .have the full name ox
the Company â California Fig Syrup CoTâ printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations
they find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer pa^se3
off on a customer a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs" or u Fig Syrup," which
does not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has been so unfortunate a3 to enter his
establishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and
and deception in one case he will do bo with other medicinal agents, and in the filling of
physicians 1 prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness.
Knowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand
for our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every-
where, in original packages only, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, bnt as exceptions
exist i i3 necessary to inform the public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return
any imitation which may be sold to them. If it does not bear the full name of the Company â
California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to returfi the
article and to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class ot
druggists who will sell you what you wish and the'best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.

Down the smart set sat to eat.
â With apoloKles to Byron.
Shades of Semiramis, queen " of ' the
gorgeous, could ye but"have swept, your
eye over the Greenway ballroom last
night," with its fair" women and brave
men, set in a paradise of green and
bloom and topaz light; with music
floating' from n bower of woodland
brakes, wrecked forever would _have
been your vision -of Nineveh's- glory.
Early came the guests, with "Here's
to your birthday, Ned," tripping lightly
from every tongue. In the maple and
marble rooms the feast was spread.
And here in truth was a feast of flow
ers run riotâ American beauty roses
and larkspurs at one table, madrone
berries and autumn leaves massed on
another,- golden chrysanthemums
Hanked by maple leaves at a" fourth,
Bermuda lilies and pink carnations at
another â all under silken shades of the
blossoms' hues, sending abroad a mys
tic blend of color seen In a summer
sunset.
But those were merely externalsâ the
emphatic feature of the feast was its
rare goodfellowship. Toasts? 'Tis said
they were clever; but why not, under
the spell of roses and wine and r fair
women?
After the dinner, to which more than
a hundred were bidden, came the great
Greonway ball of 1905â officially known
as; the Friday Night Club dance.
HEALTV EVERYWHERE.
. The ballroom was garlanded with
thin ropes of green, a gigantic basket
of chrysanthemums falling from the
center. Round about it swung, fouo
great triangles of bamboo, from, which
hung yellow silken lanterns, holding
oriental symbols. It was through these
that'the topaz light filtered, finding its
tone crystallized in silken, sashes at
each, pair of Ivory pillars, holding, in
.place three great wreaths of madrone.
The effect of this tandem of wreaths
around the ballroom was a striking
feature, likewise the primrose balloons
swinging sfhuously in the far corners.
, The. muslc-^-whlch was distinctly
Greenway musicâ floated out through
an- Amazonian jungle ;of palms.
And the. gownsâ ah! Here, was a rev
elation in truth. and v some mighty
stunning women wore them.

Bradstreet Also Notes an
Increased Activity in a
Number of Industries
NEW YORK, Nov. 4.â Dun's weekly
review of trade to-morrow will say:
Business improves steadily and there is
no evidence of anxiety regarding the
future. Payments are more promptly
met. tending to stimulate preparations
for coming trade, and the disposition to
limit purchases to immediate needs is
gradually disappearing. Aside from in
flation caused by speculation there is
no better sign of commercial progress
than advancing commodity markets.*
All the leading branches of manufac
ture are in a better position. Traffic, re
ports are satisfactory, railway earnings
in October exceeding last year's by 7.6
per cent.
Foreign commerce returns at .this port
for the last week' show a gain of J7SD.
276 in exports and a loss of $297,752 in
imports as compared with 1903.
Wholesome progress is recorded in the
iron and steel industry. Limited sup
plies, maintain hides In a very strong
position, and some lines are bought on
advances. Raw wool has again ad
vanced and is an important factor in
the situation.
Commercial failures for the week In
the United Statea are 239, against 233
last week and 246 in the corresponding
week of last year. Failures In Canada
number 27. against 23 last week and 22
in the same week last year.
Bradstreet's to-morrow will say:
Warm weather, activity in fall farm
work and to a lesser degree ante-elec
tion interviews detracted from retail
trade distribution North and West. For
like reasons jobbing sales axe rather
smaller In volume. Against this, how
ever, is to be noticed increased activity
in a number of industries, headed by
iron, steel and allied lines of manufac
ture. Resumption of work by 10.000
Eastern cotton mill hands is a feature,
but the great Fall River tie-uo con
tinues.
A very general advance In staple
prices, covering 1 a wide range of indus
try, is an event worthy of note. Re
ports from the winter wheat crop are
of an immense acreage in that cereal,
but drought and Hessian fly damage
repiwts detract from an otherwise, ex
cellent prospect in the surplus produc
ing States in th.e. West. The South
gives the best - reports as to trade.

From information available they average sev

In the bench deposits lower values mar be
expected. The extensive river beds are known
to contain some gold, but are of so low value
that dredging would probably be the only
profitable m'fthod of worklnr them.
While tome of the deposits on the lower
claims of the Porcupine have been considerably
developed the greater number remain un

Injured by Falling Lumber.
Late in the afternoon of October 18
ten masked men, armed with -"Win
chester rifles, rode out of the timber
near his flock | and demanded that he
throw; up his hands until he could be
searched. Refusing to comply imme
diately, the rifles were leveled at him
and he was threatened with death if
he offered any resistance. -After search
ing his pockets and taking away his
revolver the herder was ordered to run
as rapidly as possible and, neither stop
nor look back until he had covered a
distance of three miles.
When only a '.few hundred yards
away he heard the shooting commence,
but he continued on hisrway. The
searching party which returned the
next day found 400 of the band lying
dead along a ravine where they had
been shot down while running from the
noise accompanying the shots. The
remainder of the band was scattered
over a distance of several miles and
the entire day was consumed in getting
the sheep ' together.
The party then followed as far as
possible the prints of the horses' hoofs,
but in the timber, where the pine
needles lay as thick as matting, these
were soon lost from sight.

PRINEVILLE. Ore.. Nov. 4.â Four
hundred sheep owned .by U. S. Cowles
are the latest victims of the great
sheep war which has raged through
out South and Central Oregon for more
than a year. The sheep were slaugh
tered by ten masked men, who held up
the herder, disarmed him arid ordered
him from the scene before the butchery
began. The killing followed closely
upon the cattlemen's assertion, made
at the annual meeting of their associa
tion, that their cattle shall and will be
provided with grassing in the Blue
Mountain ranging district. The slaugh
ter occurred on Cowles' ranch at the
head erf Mill Creek, twenty-eight miles
northeast of Prineville. It took place
October 18, but news of it reached here
only to-day.
Cowles left his ranch a short time
before the raid was made and knew
nothing of the slaughter until his re
turn. The \ shooting of the sheep is
generally laid at the door of the cattle
men, who have made threats against
the sheep Interests and who ha.ve
themselves suffered by unseen hands.
Following is, the herder's story:

Herr Erler, the representative of

ing the Goverment responsible for the
consequences in event of its refusal to
do so. There have been many arrests.
The rioting continued intermittently
throughout the day. The students, re

windows in the Hofburg and made a
hostile demonstration at the Italian

The Twenty-eighth Infantry went
into- the model camp yesterday prepara
tory to Its departure. Companies L and
M, in command of Captains James A.
Lynch and James Ronayne, win depart
to-morrow morning for Fort Lincoln,
North Dakota, and Colonel Pitcher
with the "other companies and the band
will leave early on Monday morning for
Fort Snelling, at St. Paul.
A great protest la going up just out
side the gates of the Presidio. The pro
test is made , by the owners of
the saloons and groceries in that
immediate locality because the
Twenty-eighth Infantry, which is on
the eve of Its departure for Eastern
posts, has not been paid off and will not
be paid off here, so that the $5000 or
thereabouts that Is coming to the regi
ment will not be spent around the Pre
sidio gates.
General MacArthur has for a long time
been trying to have the joints near the
Presidio abolished, but his efforts have
met vrkh 111 success. In the present in
stance, .with the co-operation of
Colonel W. L. Pitcher, commander of
the Twenty-eighth Infantry, he has
made a big coup. All the saloons about
the entrance to the post have been run
ning without licenses, and the city au
thorities are said to have made no ef
fort to s tor. the selling of liquors at
these places. The saloons have had a
Government revenue license, but that
is all. They have been kept open in di
rect violation and defiance of the law.
- When' General 'MacArthur found he
could not get the saloons suppressed he
decided to take the matter into his own
hands. He . certainly grabbed the bull
by the horns this time. It is reported
that " the saloons in that neighborhood
have allowed about SO per cent-x>f the
soldiers to run up bills to the full
amount of their month's pay. Now they
will be compelled to whistle for their
money and wait till the soldiers choose
to send them funds from Fort Snelling,
to which post most of them are bound.
The Twenty-first Infantry is due to
arrive earlv this morning. It will be
met at Oakland mole by the Slocum
and transDorted to the Presidio. The
regiment came in three trains. :
- WASHINGTON. Nov. 4.âNegotia
tions have been begun for a treaty of
arbitration between Germany and the
| United States. Several days ago Presl-
I dent Roosevelt suggested to Baron von
j Sternberg, the German Embassador.
i that a treaty of arbitration between
j the United States and Germany would
, in his judgment be very desirable. Em
j bassador von Sternberg coincided with
j this view and told the President that
j h.e would inquire of his Government
| what sters if any it desired to take In
. the matter.
I Late this afternoon Emhassador von
; Sternberg called upon President Roose
i velt and Informed him that the Ger
, man Government had expressed Itself
j as entirely agreeable to the President's
< proposition and that he had been di

PORCUPINE DISTRICT.
Charles W. Wright of the United
States Geological Survey has made a
report relative to the Porcupine placer
mining district in Alaska. The dis
trict is In Southeastern Alaska, near
the international boundary line. Since
the discovery of the placers on Porcu
pine Creek, in 1S98,. the gold produc
tion vf the region has amounted to
about $160,000, according to the best
available sources of information. In
part Mr. Wright reports as follows: â¢
The gold-bearing gravels in this vicinity
are confined . to the . few creeks and benches
lying within an area five miles wide and tes
miles long that extends from Xugget Creek
oct the Salmon to the moath ef Porcupine
Creek on the Klehlnl. - Belts of mineralized
Â¦lates ' Included in this area are crosscut by
the streams, and from these the gold has
be*a derived. The workable deposits vary
from twenty-five feet to several hundred feet
in width and are from a few feet to forty
feet er more in depth. The gold-producing
gravels on the Porcupine extend to the moath
ef MeKlniey Creek and up this tributary for
a distance of a mile. Os-Nngret .Creek the
Kthd iÂ» ttmited to* the lower dalras.^SW "--:;
The creek sravels are the most valuable.
The tcrsl mineral production ef the United j
EtAtes fcr 19C3, the latest year for which com- J
r>te natUtics are available, was 51.259,639.- I
415. Of this enormous valu* $64:.25$.5S4 was I
contributed by the metals and $*il7. :>!>. S31 by |
the non-s^taHlc mineral products. If these 1
fljurea could be accented as a Just valuation i
of the relative commercial Importance of the !
twr classes It woald appear that the j metals !
had contributed 51 per cent and the ) nan- 1
roitals 43 per cent of the total. The mar- {
vclnu* growth of the American Portland !
czn>*=.' industry shows that the gold pro- !
ductlon of Cripple Creek is parallel to and '
onlj slightly above that for Portland cement. 1
while the production of Alaska daks into com- ;
paratlve insignificance. The inort surprising
part of this Increase la the cement indnstry
has been within the past eight years. A Port
land cement production valued at about 12.
5TO.0CO in 1SSÂ«S has risen to oxer *S,000.0ro ta I
1303. I
it has no intention of going into rate-cutting
business may be accented for what the state
ment is worth; that the company will not
precipitate a competitive war with the pro
ducers of Southern California may be well be
lieved, but such assurances offer no guarantees
fcr the future â nor can it be expected that they
should. If the future should disclose a pro
duction in Kern County in excess of sales,
creating large o^iantities of oil in storage,
the Kern peos>!e will be very apt to do what
others would under similar circumstances do,
seÂ«k to unload its accumulations, offering con
sumer* the inducement of a cut under prevail
ing- rate*. Unless the producer** in the Los
Anj?Â»l*Â«. Whittler and Fullerton fields get to
gether with the Associated Oil people oil will
be selling in a few mends in. tjos Angeles at
lower cric<!Â» than it is ceiling for to-day.
Attention is directed by the Los An
geles Herald to an interesting and
somewhat surprising disclosure made
by the returns of the mineral produc
tion of the T'nited States for 1903. A
part of the Herald's presentation of
facts and deductions is as fol
lows:
The purchase of the plant and real estate
ef the Oil Storage and Transportation Com
pany by the Associated Oil Company means
that the producers of Kern County have de
cided to have a slice of oil consumption In
Southern California. That the Associated Oil
Company should hasten to make known that
According to the statements of the
Los Angeles Mining Review, It may be
fairly inferred that the operations of
the Associated Oil Company are oc
casioning some uneasiness among the
oil producers in the fields that lie south
of Tehachapi. In part the Mining Re
view say's:

George A. Tweedy has been inter
viewed by the Los Angeles Herald
about the mineral belt that runs
through the Sierra Madres in Western
Chihuahua and Eastern Sonora. He
eays in substance:
While this belt is remote from transporta
tion, it Is rich in gold, generally free. The
veins are true Csstsres. as a rule, large and
numerous. The- gold is generally too coarse
for the cyanide treatment. The Mulatoe camp
Is In aboet the center of this gold belt, ex
tending northwest and southeast, a distance of.
about eighty miles each way. Among- the
prominent properties o< that belt are the Mula
tcs. Sikuayacan on the north. Trigo. Colon
and many splendid prospects. This belt Is an
excellent prcÂ«pecting territory, and has been
neglected on account of it* remoteness from
transportation fcy railroad. Being particulariy
a rrold belt with abundant timber and water
mTScient In rnoet cases, many properties could
be worked with profit.
The Yukon World, published at Davi
son City, estimates the total gold out
put of the Klondike for the current
year at abemt 510,000,000. The returns
that had been received at the time of
making tLe estimate gave a known
total of $3,500,000 and upward. Some
claims had not reported the results of
their work. The period covered was
to the close of September. In that time
the gold exported from Forty-mile paid
royalties amounting to S53S3. The ex
ports via White Horse paid in royal
ties the sum of $21,541 30.

Believing that the husband was more
sinned against than sinning, Judge Mel
vin to-day decided the Sheahan divorce
case by granting John J. Sheahan a de
cree on his cross-complaint from Mabel
C. Sheahan. She is a spiritualistic me
dium, and used their home on Linden
street for seances and neglected . her
husband and their children. Sheahan
also . obtained the custody _ of the boy
and girl. The community property is
to be sold and divided equally between
Mr. and Mrs. Sheahan.
' The trial of the. case attracted consid
erable attention owing to the unruly
conduct of. .Mrs. Sheahan, whom the
Judge was finally forced to send to Jail
for contempt of court. She brought the
suit against her husband, charging him
with cruelty. She filed a cross-com
plaint alleging that she was the cruel
one. The evidence in the case showed
that Mrs. Sheahan's actions were the
beginning of the trouble and that when
she^was remonstrated with she went

mittee will try to procure the Insertion
of a paragraph in the proposed bond
issue ~ providing for the 'appropriation
of money sufficient for a municipal
water plant.
Ai'L. Ott in a speech on the subject
before'- the club declared that the city
should ait least own its piping system,
and If possible its own Water plant.
. ,City Auditor Hanscom said: "The
town could arrange its own piping sys
tem-and put in pumping- plants that
would, do away, with the necessity of
fire engines. Philadelphia has a water
distributing system that regulates the
pressure of water in such a manner as
to enable the city to dispense with for
ty-five engines formerly used. Munici
pal ownership is the proper thing for
Berkeley."

OAKULND, Not. 4. â The reading of
a riasir^r letter from Governor George
C PtnSee oa tbe issues of the caxn
psisn. c&liozral and local, was tne fea
ture of the sajofcer and rally of West
OaiJaod Republicans, held to-night un
der the auspices of the Forty-nintli As
sembly District dub at Alcatrax BalL
There were pipes and entertainment
for every one and the spacious hall
was crowded. A. number of Repub
lican candidates were present and the j
meeting was addressed by several well
known party leaders.
Martin Hanley waa chairman of tSie
meeting: Music was furnished by Pal

by the Berkeley Quartet, under the
guidance of the veteran "Brick"

PARDEE SENDS LETTER.
The first speaker was J. J. .Burke, \
Republican candidate for Assembly- [
man from the Forty-ninth Assembly,
District-- Before making bis address j
he read the following letter from Gov
ernor Pardee: ... ..
Answering yoiira of October 29. Inclosing
lnv! union tor Â«ce to attend the smokw ot tbe
Kcrl>-nirÂ»th Assembly District Republican Club
on November 4, notluag would give me greater
ljie&sure than 10 meet and shake hands again
with u.y fiveads of the Forty-ninth. For.
aftÂ«-r nil, there axe no friend* like the old
::>rJs. no people like one's own townsmen.
Bat unfortucateiy I have already accepted
an invitation to attend and speak at a public
mett-iu* here in Sacramento on the evening
oZ Xoveaber *. ani therefore not being able
ti> be in two places ax one and the same time,
v\ea though 1 <io happen to be Governor, I
muÂ£t lortfc'o the pleasure of having an evening
with my Jriends of the Forty-ninth.
California is going to give a tremendous
majority for the Krpubllcan ticket this year.
Sty prediction Is that the majority will be
nearly, if not Quite C-J.OOO. And of that tiO.QUO
Alan-.t-da County. Oakland, and the Forty-ninth
Assembly Uistrict will, I &m sure, give their
lull Quota.
Ksj*L-iaily should the Forty-cinth District
be K^pablican thin year. For no one has for
Â»--".:Â¦ r.. 1 hope, what hap;t-ncj to us all. In
cluding the Forty-ninth, under Cleveland with
hit free trade in the jeers '93 to 'Â»7. You
uil remember what the "point" looked like
then, how many were out of work, how many
lost their homes, hew many were In actual
want of the necessaries of life. You all see
hoT.- different It is now, and how different It
has b'-en for the last eix or eight years under
Republican protection, McKinlfy and Roose
velt. And 1 hav e no doubt that the people
ot" the Forty-ninth are very willing to vote
u. continue the good times they are enjoying.
If they want to go back to the hard times of
*t)3 to '97 let them vote for Parker, whose
platform says that protection is "robbery"
of the many for the benefit of the few, and ,
wh->. therefore. wlJl, if he be elected, do all
he can. as Cleveland did, to sweep protection :
out of existence and again Inaugurate "taritf
lor revenue" or free trade, with all its at- :
tendant hard time*, like t*joÂ»* of '83 to '97.
It is amusing to hear our Democratic friends
fay that â¢protection is the mother of trusts,"
ana that if we will do away with protection
and take up free trade aealn we will "bast
thr trust." We had free trade under Cleve
land. iJid It bust a single trust? ' Not one.
The only ones who got busted then were the
people of the United States. Including my
ii lends of the Forty-ninth. The trusts went
right on doing business and net one of them
biistc-d. If free trade didn't bust the trusts
in 'flS to '07 it surely will not bust them In
1DG3 to 1909. But it will bust us again as
it did under Cleveland?
You all know President Roosevelt. You
ut him in Oakland a ye&r and a half ago.
You saw that he is a plain, ordinary every
day American, Just like the rest of us. He
is no diftereiit from you and me. I know,
brcause I was with him during the twelve
days he was in California. And there wasn't
a minute of those twelve days when he was
anything else, but just a plain, good-natured,
affable American man. glad to see any one
and every one who came to him in good faith.
Th-y say he If the friend of the trusts.
You all remember how he broke up the great
railroad merger, which weld have beea the
pratest trust the world has ever seen. You
all remember how he smashed the salt trust.
You haven't forgotten the coal strike. Neither
can you have forgotten how he sent half a
dozen of the poetofSce thieves to prison.
WÂ«- wanted also the Panama canal and we
wanted it badly. Who save it to us, after
Colombia had tried to fool us again and again
repudiated a solemn agreement the had made
with us? Like the man he Is the P/esldent
made Colombia keep her bargain, and all the
other nations of the earth, . who are more
jealous of Roosevelt's and our success than
even the Democrats, wild "Well done."
1 am Â«ure. too. that the voters of the Forty
ninth rhPtrict will remember that the coming
legislature will elect a United States Senator
from California, who will hold office for six
years. And If th--y want a United States
Senator who will support Roosevelt and pro
tection, one who does not believe In free trade,
the poople of the Forty-ninth will, of course,
vote for the Republican nominee for the As
sembly. For that nominee (whose name, by
the way. is Burke) must vot# for a Republican
t.'nited States Senator, one who does not be
lieve that protection is "robbery," one who
will be with Roosevelt In protecting us all
and keeping up our present good times.
-Again expre*stng any regret at not. being
able to meet my good friends of the Forty
nlsth. and wirhisg them all rood luck, hap
piness and prosperity, I am, very truly yours,
I GEO. C, PARDEE.
The reading of the letter aroused
much enthusiasm. Burke waa fre
quently Interrupted by the applause
which many of the points occasioned.
Burke addressed the audience briefly
In regard to his own candidacy and
was followed by Arthur H. Breed,
Charles E. Snook, Philip M. Walsh, Re
publican nominee for the Forty-eighth
Assembly District, Felton Taylor and
Supervisor John Mitchell, who is a
candidate for re-election.
Joseph R. Knowland, the Republrean
candidate for Congress from the Third
District, arrived during the festivities
and waa warmly received. He spoke
briefly.
Judge John F. . Davis was next'in
troduced. He raised a storm of cheers
when he- announced that his purpose
was to say a word for Duncan McKin
lay. The speaker discussed the value
of a Congressman to his district and
showed that under the system that
prevails in the House of Representa
tives the work is done in committees
where the minority members of the
House have but little influence, or in
caucus of the dominant party, where
the minority has no representation at
alL The speaker proved the helpless
ness of a minority member in Con
gress, citing as proof ' the fact that
Senaior Perkins was obliged to do the
woik necessary to procure the building
of a collier at Mare Island.
Frank H. Short also addressed the
meeting, paying a high . tribute to the
merits of Duncan McKinlay and
strongly urged his election to Congress.
Governor Pardee was greeted with a
storm of applause when he arose to
speak. He spoke for an hour, devoting
much time to the national issues and
the personality of President Roosevelt.
The speaker deprecated the idea ,of
electing a Republican President and a
Democratic Congressman. He urged
that the latter would be obliged to en
ter the caucus of his party and abide
by its decision on political questions or
else become a political pirate. . ~ ; 1 : '-
Congressman Bell's plaint that the
Governor should not participate in a
Congressional contest was met with, a
parable which showed the Governor's
spirit and made clear his right to voice
his political sentiments. His answer
to Bell won him round after round of
applause. . Governor Pardee closed
with an appeal to the voters to sup
port the Congressional and legislative
nominees.
The meeting to-night was preceded
by a splendid parade of all the Repub
lican clubs in the city, marshaled by
Colonel H. I. Seymour. The line of
march was ablaze with fireworks and
great enthusiasm was displayed by the
thousands of people who thronged the
sidewalks. The pavilion was filled
before the procession reached the build
ing. State Printer W. W. ( Shannon
was chairman of the "meeting.-
pavilion to its utmost capacity.
' McKinlay arrived on the morning
train from Chico, where he had made a
splendid address to a large audience
the preceding evening. He spent the
morning: at his home and at noon ad
dressed the employes of the railroad
shops at the Sixth-street entrance. It
was the most successful noon meeting
held at the shops this year. During
the afternoon the Congressional nomi
nee went out to Fair Oaks and ad
dressed a representative gathering.

G.^W. Pierce of Davisville spoke for

He said that the wheat growers of j the
valley were not. willing to. experiment

a sale for .the wheat that, they have
been accustomed to produce for a

interests "are parallel with those of the

in general would advocate a bill before
the â¢ Legislature that . will provide all
necessary funds for experimenting on
the lines under discussion/ Mr. Pierce's
talk was' convincing, as was attested
by i hearty applause.
Â¦Mr. ; Frledlander : moved that a com

SPEAKS FOR SACRAMENTO.
Mr. Friedlander made apt reference
to a story of the efforts of a farmer
who had a field of gypsum ' and
a field of grain close to each
other.' The farmer mined the gypsum
and fertilized a portion of his ground
in the formation of letters that spelled
the word "gypsum." The wheat grew
luxuriously and was a glorious adver
tisement of the benefits that had ac
crued from, the fertilizing process.
Mr. Frledlander thinks that Califor
nia .can make some similar demonstra
tion-of the value of renewing the
strength of worn out soil. He said that
in England, where fertilizing was
necessary, â¢ the fields grew an average
of thirty bushels to . the acre, but in
California the . average yield was not
above Â¦ fourteen bushels.
The speaker added that Professor
Shaw had said that he thought that
$3000 would be enough to start- with
and an additional sum of $5000 would
not be difficult" to obtain from the
Legislature.
Carey Friedlander spoke of the work
of-the Merchants' Exchange, the Cham
ber of Commerce and the State Board
of Trade in the line of promoting the
production of milling. wheat. Professors
Shaw and Wickson of the University of
California, who were present, had of
fered many valuable suggestions which
the speaker thought" worthy of trial.
Mr. Friedlander spoke of the good
that had resulted from legislative action
in the matter of water and forest re
serves, and reminded his hearers that
the Legislature had appropriated $30,000
to assist the advocates of that issue in
theirj work of carrying "out their ideas.
Before' the money mentioned had been
voted by the- State a subscription Â°f
512,000 was collected by thos^e interested
in the work.. The preliminary work of
the committees of the Board of Trade
and the Merchants' Exchange could be
provided for by private . subscription,
but Mr. Frledlander- said that : he
thought that the State Legislature
would willingly furnish , funds for at
least two years of research and. experi
mental labor.
VAL.UABI.iE SUGGESTIONS.
The commercial: bodies of the State
have at a definite plan of . ac
tion for the betterment* of the wheat
growing industry of California. Ban
Francisco has taken the initiative in
support of the theory that to produce
wheat that will meet with v the require^
ments of the. miller something- must be
done (to introduce more : gluten in the
grain/that it may be rendered unneces
sary for the manufacturers of flour to
purchase "foreign" > wheat to stimulate
the commodity that is harvested in Cal
ifornia, fields. Â¦ .-. . â
Forty or more representative' business
men, most of whom are operators in
the produce and wheat' market, were
present yesterday at- the luncheon at
the ; St. Francis Hotel 'j arranged by
prominent J members of the Merchants'
Exchange with the object of affording
an opportunity to discuss a matter thai
is of vital Importance to farmers..
After luncheon Carey Frledlander,
secretary of the -Merchants' Exchange,
said: "We are here to talk over a very
important matter," and I think the time
has arrived for us to proceed to busi
ness."
Fairfax H. Wheelan was chosen to
preside, and in his introductory re
marks spoke of I the interest â¢ that had
been aroused throughout the State over
the effort to make California wheat a
more marketable product-
General N. P. Chlpman said that the
question of advancing the standard of
wheat produced in the valleys of Cali
fornia was one that -should be given
close study. The gradual elimination of
wheat lands and the planting of fruit
trees and vines had probably been the
result of an effort to obtain Increased
revenue, but the fact remains that the
falling off of wheat produqtion is un
doubtedly due to something other than
this. - â¢ .'

Business Men and Farmers
Discuss Important Matter
at an Informal Luncheon
It was the bringing: home of the har
vest of the sea yesterday morning when
the whalers Jeanette, Narwhal and
Thrasher came from the north with
their cargoes of bone and oIL The three
vessels are steamers, and when the
vdr.ds are unfavorable they stow their
canvas and follow the school, for a
whale when disturbed will steer to
windward, where a sailing ship cannot
follow. The steam engine is a factor
the great oil-producing animal of the
ocean cannot always shake out of his
loaming wake.
The Jeanette, Captain Xewth, has
10,000 pounds of bone as her share of
the season's hunt in the Arctic, while
the Thrasher, Captain Macomber,
brings down 4000 pounds of bone, BOO
barrels of oil, 72 foxskins and three
white bearskins. The Narwhal, Captain
Leavitt. after two seasons in the Arc
tic, has in her hold the bone and blub
ber of eishtecn whales, over 10,000
pounds of bone and 5000 gallons of oil.
She also has 100 pounds of ivory and
150 foxskins. The vessel brought down
from Dutch Harbor 2000 pounds of bone
belonging to the whaler Bowhead.
Among the returning sailors aboard
the Jeanette Is Frank Lewis, a 16-year
old lad, who ran away from his home
in Denver, Colo. He shipped on the
whaler last March and returns with an
Increased knowledge of the huge mam
mal of the sea. and none the worse for
ear. One of the crew of the Narwhal
is Walter Wells, who left the Bowhead
last year when Captain Cook of that
vessel, Wells says, made his vessel a
torrid zone for his men, even In the
Arctic. Wells lived with the Indians on
Hersehel Island and did everything
they did except tattoo his face. The
natives treated him with great kindness
and adopted him with much ceremony
into the tribe. He learned to eat seal
blubber In all degrees of age. and could
"mush" a crack dog turnout over the
Ice with the most skillful Indian whip.
Wells had no objection to being made
crown prince of the rancheria, and even
began to grow ambitious and look for
vard to the chieftainship; but they
picked out a wife for him. Wells said
she was a beautifuKcreature â as beau
tiful as a walrus, and about as shapely.
He declined the honor of being spliced
to this Arctic princess, and when the
big men of the tribe begran to consider
his refusal an insult and insist on the
wedding Wells Jumped the country-
And no moss grew under his "muck
lucks" as he hit the high places on the
tundra for the beach and the Narwhal.

fCT^HE Second Mrs. Jim," by Stephen Conrad, a story of plain,
I old-fashioned folks, told by the second Mrs. Jim herself, is
one of the most enjoyable fiction offerings that The Sunday
Call has given. The book, which is written in the first person, filled
with quaint, homely turns of humor and pithy axioms, will be
published complete to-morrow. The second Mrs. Jim is in all re
spects a remarkable woman. Well past the first blush of girlhood,
she marries "Mr. Jim" and assumes the task of instilling herself
into the affections of his children. How well she succeeds and how
nearly she approximates the ideal as a stepmother and as a mother
in-law can best be understood from the modest story of her life,
Â¦which she tells over the kitchen table. Her wholesome, sweet
tempered disposition, her out-and-out fun. and her shrewd, kindlv.
and tactful method of winning all points that are legitimately hers,
give her at once front rank as a character new to fiction^
"The Adventures of Reuben/' by Edward W..Townsend, which
have proven entertaining reading for some.- months past, are con-,

Wagon," by Charles Dryden, being the chronicles of an amateur
"hobo" from the pen. of a former San Francisco newspaper man,
are continued through the formatrve and imaginative period of boy
hood up to the time when the native hamlet is left behind and the
aspiring youth sets forth to conquer the world. 5 : The. early South

RIBBON WAISTS.
We like them as well as ever for
trimmings, and as for sashes, it is only
because of the more somber attire suit
able . to the season that prevents the
handsome sash ribbons from being as
much in evidence as ever. They figure
in all sorts of girdles.
We come not to talk of these old fa
vorites, however. Now quite: the latest
thing is to have a waist entirely of rib
bon. You say that is not new. But it
is. -Instead of the more or less narrow
ribbons : used for waists â¢ of yore these
new waists are composed of the dainty
hued ribbons,- with a- stripe along .the
edge,- and, nearly .as wide as ordinary
silk. The lengths of ribbon may- be
sewed together by means of a. fancy
stitch, or the joinings, may be invisible.
These waists are the' latest bits of chic,
and a glance afthe'exquisitecolors and
designs of -these, new < wide ribbons- will
show one at a^ glance, just" how. lovely
they are, and give ;, even the 'least -Im

"If a boy be born to American parents

A PARABLE OF TO-DAY
FOR THE TABLE.
T UDGE PARKER has taken to the stump. Stephen A. Doug
las, Horace Grecle}% James G. Blaine and Bryan, when can
*** xlidates for the Presidency, went stumping, and they were
all beaten. The Judge did not need to follow their example in
order to meet their fate. His stump campaign is a regular ram
page, and his speeches consist almost entirely of personal attacks
on President Roosevelt. These attacks charge the President with
most serious offenses. His opponent accuses him of deliberately
entering into a conspiracy with the trusts, by" which money is
secured to buy the Presidency, in return for which his co-con
Â«pirators are to have immunity in the commission of illegal acts.
In 1900, Mr. Bryan made the same charge against President
McKinley, and Senator Hanna, chairman of the Republican Na
tional Committee, in a speech in Lincoln, Mr. Bryan's home, openly
denounced him as a liar. It is not going too far to say that
Judge Parker is open to the same characterization. He has had
respectful treatment from the Republican party, and his virulent
course has had as little provocation as his charges have proofs.
The anti-trust law, framed by Senator Sherman and passed
by a Republican Congress, was the law during all of President
Cleveland's second term. The trusts were then in existence. They
flourished under the Wilson tariff. Mr. Cleveland's Attorney Gen
eral, who is making speeches for Judge Parker, officially proclaimed
that he had no authority to enforce the Sherman law and could
not prosecute the trusts. President Roosevelt found the law just
as it was when Olney refused to enforce it. Under his direction
seven great suits were instituted against the trusts by Mr. Olney 's
successor, and were all won by the Government. Where the Demo
cratic administration declared that there was no authority, Presi
dent Roosevelt found authority. The Democrats talked and he
acted. When he acted, the trusts and their organs manufactured
the Democratic campaign Issue against him by raising the cry that
he was "an unsafe" man for President. Up to that time that charge
was unheard. The Democracy took it from the trusts and have
used it as a club ever since.
When the merger case against J. J. Hill's railroad trust was
decided in the President's favor by the Supreme Court, all of the
Democratic Justices dissented, and wrote that charge into their
dissenting opinions. They held, with varying plainness of state
ment, that the President and Attorney General had no authority to
prosecute the trust, thus affirming the position of Mr. Olney and
the last Democratic administration. These are the record facts.
They have become part of the history of the country. The Presi
dent's position is written into the great anti-trust decisions, which
are a leading feature of his administration. Those decisions arc
the law of the land, which the President cannot bargain away if
he would. Under such circumstances, Judge Parker's accusations
i? a calumny, and its utterance is beneath the dignity of a Presi
dential candidate.
There is no other instance in our political history of the
descent of a candidate for that office to such merely personal slander,
except in the case of Mr. Bryan. It might have been expected of
Mr. David B. Hill, or that political chameleon, Mr. Bourke Cock
ran, or of any of the Democratic .campaign spellbinders. But it
was not thought that Judge Parker is so small a man. He has
absolutely no proof of that which he states as a fact within his
own knowledge. If taken into court a slanderer under the statutes,
his plea of justification could not be substantiated and he would
be found guilty. It is miserable business, but it shows that Mr.
David B. Hill knew his man when he had him nominated.
Mr. Bryan became noted for wild and inaccurate speech, but
Judge Parker has eclipsed him. In his speech at Meriden, Connecti
cut, he said : "After the recommendation six or eight years ago
that action should be taken toward curbing the trusts, the Re
publican party passed a statute to that end, but when we examine
that statute closely we find that it authorizes the President to
appoint a Cabinet officer to investigate the trusts. The information
he receives may be given to the people, or kept" private, as the
President may direct. The man he put at the head of that bureau
was his private secretary, and after the campaign opened he be
came chairman of the Republican National Committee, and the heads
of corporations knew what secrets he had that they did not care
Just what the muddled man is talking about is hard to find out.
The anti-trust law. which he seems to mean, was passed during
Harrison's administration, and under that law and the interstate
commerce act all of the trust prosecutions have been made. But
it did not provide for the appointment of any Cabinet officer. In
the same sentence he speaks of the creation of "a bureau," to which
President Roosevelt appointed his private secretary, Mr. Cortelyou.
Here he probably means the act of February 14, 1903, creating the
Cabinet Department of Commerce and Labor, which is not a bureau
at all. Out of this roily sentence issues, as a proper thing to come
out of mud slime, the charge that the President used official knowl
edge of "secrets" to force the trusts into a conspiracy with himself!
It is a charge fit to come from a man whose campaign has been
characterized from the beginning by ascribing infamy and crime
to the President of the United States. 'Democrats who love their
country and would keep its history clean are appalled by Judge
Parker's plunge into shame.

to be doing a good business in Insur

cashed a number of checks at stores
in this city, which were refused at the
banks, as there were no funds ta cover
them. The Central Bank to-day levied
an attachment on his office furniture
to cover an overdraft at the bank, and
other attachments have been made.

and is at a loss to account for his sud

SAN BERNARDINO, Nov. 4.âAn
drew Chase, a young man who came
to this city about three months ago,
and has since been operating in real
estate and insurance, has left the city
and no knowledge of his whereabouts
can be obtained. He has not been seen
since last Wednesday. There is a great
diversity of opinion expressed on the
streets as to his motives In leaving
the city.
' Mr. Smith's citation was then taken
up and when Mr. Hanlon offered to ex
amine Mr. Lipman. Attorney Sutro en
tered an objection /and said he would
carry It to the Supreme Court to de
cide whether any person could look
into the bank's books on such a doubt
ful proceeding. Lipman was allowed to
go, but Bannan and Shaw were exam
ined as to the first appraisement. They
said that no property was submitted to
them for appraisement and that they
had so reported to the court in the In
ventory, but explained that at the time
of Douglas' death the property listed
and valued at $514,000 had been on de
posit at the bank. They did not know
where it was taken.
The Information demanded by Spe
cial Appraiser E. C. Harrison as to the
value of the estate of J. M. Douglas
before the property was removed from
the Wells-Fargo Bank, was gained yes
terday afternoon in 1 Judge Coffey's
court, but not until after a warm legal
scrimmage. Attorney Alfred Sutro rep
resented the bank officials and resisted
the order to produce the information.
This was done, he said, not because
the bank did not want to give it cheer
fully, but because it wanted to be sure
that the court had jurisdiction, in the
matter and that the proceedings were
legal before it disclosed the business of
its depositors. Mr. Harrison partici
pated in the case and" City Treasurer
John E. McDougald, who Is trying to
recover $30,000 as inheritance tax
from the missing es/ate, was repre

ent, representing William J. Smith, one

was withdrawn from the files.
Cashier Frederick Lipman of the

o'clock, but he did not have the bank's
books containing the Information de
sired. After considerable parleying
among the lawyers. Judge Coffey per
emptorily ordered Mr. Lipman to have
the books in court at A o'clock. At that
hour an Inspection of the records dis
closed the fact that on the day of
Douglas* death, January 17 last,he had
$13,522 in cash on deposit, $43,004 in

and redeposited In their name as ex
ecutors of the estate. On May 2 the
cash amounted to S27.0S2 TS and on that
day it and the securities were removed
from the bank. Thl3 is probably the
date on which it was sent to Nevada
and two days later the appraisers
found no estate to appraise.

SANTA CI*A.RA, Nov. 4.â Much inter
est is attached to the preparations now
being made' by the", Senior Dramatic
Club of Santa Clara College to produce
at the college theater on the evening of
November 23 a religious drama entitled
"The Eternal , Light.** California." critics
will watch the'f effect of the new play
with special attention, as Its young au
thor, Martin V. Merle, who is still . a
student at the college, has Introduced
himself most favorably already 'by two
small playlets/ "The Cardinal's Pris
oner" and "The Prairie Judgment," the
latter of which scored a distinct suc
cess at the Alcazar. Theater, San Fran
cisco, last July.
The- present drama Is a tale of the
persecution,' full of the pomp and glitter
of the pagan court,' and Is built upon
the character of the famous boy mar
tyr.; Pancratius/ whom Wiseman in his
"Fabiola" has immortalized. Sebastian,
the giant .". captain In the Emperor* a
guard; 'the Emperor, Diocletian; Cor
vinus, prefect of Rome, and Dionysius.
father of Pancratlus^ are the principal
characters In, the drama.
The play? has been under
for nearly two .months, the Intention
being to. make It the most spectacular
and elaborate production that the dra
matic club of the ( old mission college
has yet presented. Brilliant scenic and
electrical effects, costumes copied from
famous paintings, specially prepared
music and a male choir of twenty voices
are the prominent features of "The
Eternal Light."-
A "miracle" effect Is Introduced in
the fourth act in a strikingly effective
manner. Pancratiua Is forced to his
knees hj. the Emperor's guards before
a. massive statue of the god Jupiter, to
whom he is commanded to pay homage
by Diocletian. In answer to his cry for
help a blinding flash' of light smashes
the idol to fragments and .leaves In its
place a brilliantly .lighted cross. Â«In the
midst of the sudden hush Pahcratius
clings to the cros3, sobbing, as the cur
tain descends.
In the closing scene of the drama a
double impersonation of the boy mar
tyr immediately after he is thrown to
the beasts In the Coliseum renders pos
sible a wonderful transformation scene.
In which the spirit of the young Chris
tian rises from the mangled body on
the arena floor. The courtroom of the
Emperor Is another brilliant scene. In
which nearly one hundred persons take
part.

"With due respect for your sense of
chivalry. Mr. Carter,** said hia Honor
Mogan, "I shall be compelled to pro
nounce you guilty as charged unless
you prove that you were merely acting
as an agent for another. The only
way in which that proof can be fur
nished, it seems, ia by producing your
alleged employer."
"Nuffin* on ea'th could Indoose me
ter do dat, Jedge, yo* Honnah," was
the fervent rejoinder.
As he was paying a fine of $5 to
the clerk Mr. Carter replied In the
negative to a whispered query as to
whether he was acquainted with Miss
Anastatia Johnson, a name that has
figured tn many dissensions of Afro-
American society on lower Pacific
street. "Ah've hea'd ob de lady." he
added, "but she cuts no lcÂ«ln dia yah
'casion."
Samuel Carter (colored) resolutely
refused to disclose the Identity of the
lady who had entrusted to him the
task of cashing the lottery ticket
which was found in his possession
when Sergeant Ellis and posse arrest
ed him in Chinatown.
"No, sab." said Mr. Carter; "as a

Dr. Glover failed to respond In per
son when he was called to testify in an
assault case before Judge Fritz, but
sent notification to the court that he
was engaged at the Park Emergency
Hospital and did not consider himself
justified in leaving his post of duty un
til a duly qualified physician was sent
to take his place. When' It was ex
plained to the Judge that a subpena
had been ignored by Dr. Glover a bench
warrant was issued to compel his at
tendance to-day, and his Honor re
marked that a municipal officer's first
consideration should be the municipal
service, of which the Police Conrt is an
Instrument.
"Look out. or you'U swallow that
gum,", whispered Bailiff Hickey as he
gently placed Miss Edwards upon the
mourners' bench.
"I forgot to tell you that my parents
died when I was a child and me and
Frank have been keeping company a
good many years and I'm sure ifâ"
The advocate was rallying when the
Judge abruptly pronounced both de
fendants guilty and promised to sen
tence them to-morrow.
"No I'm not I might say I am but

two years older than I am and his folks
are in Illinois and I guess we'll get

When the pleader recovered his
breath he mildly asked the young wom

Elsie Edwards, young and rather
pretty, wore a cowboy hat and chewed
gum as she stood before Judge Mogan
and saucily pleaded not guilty to the
charges of petty larceny and vagrancy

Frank Bird. He was caught in the act
of pawning some blankets which had

Six months and more have slipped
away since the rataplan of the thor
oughbreds' feet was heard on the coast
tracks and again we are on the eve of
another racing season. One week from
to-day the new California Jockey Club
will throw open the gates of Oakland
track, and, as the circus posters read,
the public is promised a bigger and a
better show than ever before.
The handsome course across the bay
will prove a complete revelation to the
regulars. The betting ring has been
entirely remodeled and enlarged, the
approaches to the stand have been im
proved, dozens of painters with pot
land brush have toiled incessantly- for
i weeks*, while a new top dressing has
J transformed the surface of the track
J until it bjoks as smooth and glossy as
a billiard ball.
The once despised poverty row re
sembles a group c-f seaside cottages at
Newport and the grandstand might
easily be mistaken for the palace of
the Mikado.
Winter racing has become a fixed in
stitution and this coast has much more
opposition now than in former, years,
but San Francisco will get the cream
of the riding talent and its pro rata of
(the crack horses.
The new California Jockey Club has
'displayed marked liberality in dealing
with the horsemen and the. latter will
go where the money -is bung up, even
if riecess&ry to mush it to the north
pole. Thousands in added money to
stakes, with numerous : overnight ' han
dicaps of 51000 and $400 jiurses, is good
enough in any man's country.
An innovation . the" coming season,
which appears to have struck the pop
ular fancy, just right, is an amendment
to the ruies making every selling event
a- "claiming race. This has been a bone
of- contention: aratug the owners of
cheap horses for many seasons, so now
harmony is - expected r to prevail. ' If a
good horse is beaten' now in- an - or
dinary selling affair, keep your* eyes
oh the man with the halter.
Last year. Walter" Jennings, than whom
no more popular turfman ever raced
horses In California, headed the, list of
winning owners. With .a* powerful
string of more than thirty horses quar
tered at . Oakland, it looks as if. he
might repeat the trick this coming win
ter. Dainty is the ; star of the stable
and, with W. Davis to do the'pilcrtlng,
will be a big: factor in, the game.' Gar
. net Ferguson, with his'.'strapping -big
colt Bearcatcher and several other^use
ful ones, will : be : quite* a. factor* and
the stables of Willie Shields, "Skinner
& Ramsey, M. J. Daly, Burns "&
Waterhouse, Napa Stock Farm -with
the crack filly Arisbe': to carrVr its "col
ors, Louis Ezell, D. Cameron, .Tichenor
& Co.- and Wally Brinkworth will ; all
do to string ! with." Wally- has a r select
string of seven, among which are* Strol
ler, Â¦ a stake '.winner, at Chicago, ; Gray
skin and -Major, Mansir, v the : latter a

There is some question about the po
eition of A. W. Wilding in the forego
lug table. He was thirteen times at
bat in association matches during the
season, and If his score cf 2 on the oc
casion not reckoned in the list is added
to his total, it gives 401 runs for eleven
completed innings, or an average of
SC.45 per innings, which would place !
him fourth instead of third and would I
raise Petersen to third place. The In- )
r.ins-6 wae excluded from the calcula
tion because the match was decided in
the first innings and this was a second
one. The secretary of the California
Cricket Association- will make inqui
ries as to the best usage In such mat
ters. No batsman is Included in -the
list who was not at bat at least six
times and scored at least ten runs 'on
an average.

Henry Roberts of the San Francisco
County Club has received a letter from
the secretary of the Marylebone Crick
et CJub of London, settling aâ point
â¢which gave rise to come discussion
ftf ter one of the California Association '
Ex-Champion George Whitney - has
returned * from â¢> Europe, -where he has
beÂ«n in search' of health for: the last
two years. â Mr. Whitney Is better
than he was when he left, but will not
be able to. play .tennis again. , ;
The California- and Los .Angeles
Tennis clubs . are arranging ' to bring
four of the Eastern champions to the
coast in- the latter 'part of December.
A. C. Way of Los Angeles has written
the California Club" in regard to shar
ing: the expense of bringing the East
erners out and the ; club will hold a
directors'- meeting Monday night to
discuss the matter. . :'
A junior club has been started at
the park and the- boys, who are all
under. 16 years of age, will participate
In their first " tournament to-day. . The
organization of a club of this kind is
a good move, as it will undoubtedly
develop many 'players. In. the Gold
en Gate Club. the youngsters had little
chance, .but with a club of their own
they will ha%*e an opportunity to set
tle the question of supremacy among
them.
* If Long and Janes are successful
in the final 'match the Directors* cups,
which h3ve been up a littls over a
year, will go -to them permanently.
They have won the trophies twice.
The park tournament t.III bring out
the usual teams and some interesting
games will be played. The cups for
.this event have. been up for more than
two .years' and no team now playing
has won them twice. Long and Janes
are the h6lders and have proven
Â¦themselves hard men to beat under
handicap conditions.
Janes and Herbert Long will meet the
winner of the match between Al Ken
yon and Melville Long and Will Col
lier and Carl Gardner. Long and
Janes and Collier and Gardner are on
the same mark, . "fifteen" back of
scratch. Kenyon and M. Long are
"2-6** above scratch. These odds ap
pear rather small, but Kenyon and
Long defeated several good teams on
Sunday and they have a good chance
of beating both the scratch teams.
The Independent club has twenty
eight players and more than a dozen
social members en the roll. The officials
will try out some of the new men when
it can be done without risk of the club's
defeat. Among the playing members
are J. Soeder and W. Soeder. who
played association football in Cleveland.
Ohio; .T.^ransdorf of Canada, J. Ball
main from South Africa and G. Hig
gins from New Zealand. Ballxnain will
The Independent team last Sunday
included several new men who had not
been tied in a practice match. It was
beaten easily by the Occidentals. The
poorer players have been weeded out
and the team will include more of the
old guard than before- Of last year's
eleven F. Lynch has retired, though he
may take cart in the contests for the
Union cup; G. Watt is at his home in
Canada, H. Russell is on a trip to his
home in Scotland and W. Mechels, last

The only remaining event of interest
to yachtsmen of the bay during the
present season will be the raising of
the bridge" at Tiburon. which is set
down on the schedule of the Corinthian
Yacht Club for Sunday, November 13.
The concrete work for the new Belve
dere bridge has confined the current,
which now runs out and in. with such
force as to render the task of getting
the yachts into the lagoon a harder
one than in previous years. It is prob
able that a smaller number, of pleas
ure craft will seek winter quarters -in
the lagoon this year than usual. The
yawl Tramontana of the San Francisco
Yacht Club is already moored in Corte

Marsciano . was convicted of leasing
his buildings for Immoral purposes
and fined J500. He appealed to the
Superior. Court- The police continued
to arrest him dally, as he was per
sisting In violating the ordinance. JThe
writ was asked to stop these airests-
Attorney George D. Collins argued
that the subsequent arrests were il
legal.
The Judge . held that the first con
viction embraced all the offenses up
to that time, but any subsequent vio
lation was a new offense. It was hot
a proper subject for a writ of. habeas
corpus, the proper course being to
plead a prior conviction In the lower
court. If llarsicano could show that
he could not prevent the leasing - of
the buildings for immoral purposes
he could plead that as a defense.
' The . Judgment will be entered on
Monday. Meantime Collins will take
steps to bring the case before the Su
preme Court to have the action of
Judge Cook reviewed.
The argument on the application
for a writ of habeas corpus for the
release of P. Marsicano, owner of the
buildings at 1129 Dunpnt street, was

LATOXIA ENTRIES.
The serpentine was danced around
the gigantic bonfire after the speakers
had all been heard and cheered to the
echo. For thirty minutes the men
paraded on the field, while the univer
sity band played college airs and the
great throng of spectators shouted their
appreciation of the picturesque spec
tacle.
The team will line up against Nevada
to-morrow and an exciting struggle is
expected.
BERKELEY." Nov.' 4.â The last open- J
air rally of the "rooters" before the in- .
tercollegiate football game on the 12th
Inst. was held to-night on the new
California field. The affair was called
a "dedication" of the field. It was in
charge of Eugene Hallett-
Freshmen brought quantities of wood
for a gigantic bonfire in the center of
the field, and by the light of the blazing
boxes prominent students and alumni
addressed the shouting rooters until
enough enthusiasm was kindled to sat
isfy the exacting chairman of the rally
that California would not be lacking in
vim and noise when it came to boost
ing the blue and gold men at the big
game.
STANFORD UNTVERSITT/NovI' 4.â
The Stanford varsity football team
lines up to-morrow against the eleven
from -Utah Agricultural College for
the final game of the preliminary sea
son. The result of . the contest should
be an easy victory for Stanford, as
Utah is in a badly crippled condition,
having only four men in fit shape. Cap
tain Madsen, left tackle, was badly in
jured in the Multnomah game. Olsen,
the opposite tackle, will not be able to
play.
With the exception of Thomoson at
left guard the cardinal team will be at
its strongest, and an attempt will be
made to roll up the largest possible
score. It will be a good opportunity to
judge the speed of Lanagan's team, as
well as a test of the endurance of the
players.
Beginning Monday the football squad
will go into secret practice for the
week. During that time the men will
perfect their team work and will prac
tice some new and complicated plays.
By Thursday the men will be in readi
ness for the great struggle with Cali
fornia.
The line-up of to-morrow's teams will

VISITING TEAMS TO-DAY
The third practical baseball joke
of the week was played yesterday at
Recreation Park and it was on the
Seals. They never could recover from
that bunch that was handed out in the
initial period when the Brownies
jumped on them for five runs. Every
one was made after two men had been
retired and all came from clean hits.
Score. Portland, 7; San Francisco, 4.
Mr. Barber sure got his in that aw
ful spasm. After getting rid of the
first two men he let Nadeau punch out
a hit. Beck was right there with an
other and "Krug-ahro swung -through,
scoring Nadeau. Runkle got a base
on balls, but Spencer and Kellackey
each bit off two-base boys. "While
the Seal outfield was hotfooting after
the leather the Brownies were - hot
footing for the pan, and five of -them
got there.
That settled it in a hurry. Had thÂ«!

Coaches Smock aad Cavanaugh, who
have Eastern reputations, have devel
oped the fastest team on the coast and
the one nearest to Michigan in style of
play. Stars have been eliminated and
an eleven developed that depends- on
no one man nor 'set of men to do the
work. The eleven men are of . about
equal ability and each man knows
what is expected of him and does It.
In Dieti, Coach Smock has the' best
"scattered field" runner in the league,
but he believes that a "star" tends to
demoralize a team and do away with
team work. For this reason It is more
than likely Dietz will not get a chance
to shine.
The final football game for the cham
pionship of the Academic Athletic
League will be played "on the Presidio
grounds to-day at 2:30 p. m. The con
testing teams will be Lick and Oakland
high schools. This game is attracting
more attention than any academic
game ever pfayed in this city. Oak
land has beaten all competitors across
the bay, while Lick has proved ita
supremacy. on this sf4e.
The local high school team is playing
football- as it has never been played
by a "prep" school team before on the
coast. In the Lick-PalofAltOj; game
Lick averaged . three plays _\a minute
and the game was the fastest of the
season. In practice during the last two
weeks the boy3 from the Potrero have
been averaging . five plays to the min
ute and if the game to-day is not a'
whirlwind it Will, not be their fault.
The local eleven has^ developed almost
perfect team~wbrk and its play Is like

NEW v YORK, Nov. 4.â Between 10
and. 3 o'clock to-day the Broad street
curb market was almost entirelv given
over to betting on the election. Amounts
ranging up to 510,000 were wagered, but
the real feature was the laying of small
amounts, varying from $20. to $100.
Never before was there such public in
terest manifested as in -the exciting
betting of to-day.
Despite the large volume of money
wagered only one change in the odds
was reported at the close.
throughout the day was a five to one
favorite. Judge Herrick's supporters
poured thousands of dollars into the
ring and maintained the odds of ten to
seven, despite the persistent and ag
gressive betting by the men who fan
cied Higgins for Governor,
There was a remarkable shifting of
the odds on the contest in this State.
Thursday night the odds closed at five
to seven on Parker. To-day there was
a plethora of Roosevelt money and the
odds relapsed to the oil! J quotation of
two to one on Roosevelt.

ELECTION BETTING BRISK.
YREKA, Nov. 4.â The largest and
most enthusiastic meeting ever held in
Scott Valley was held at Fort Jones
last night and was addressed by R. S.
Taylor of Yreka. The speakef devoted
the greater portion of his time ta un
masking Caminetti, whom he charged
with accepting the nomination on a
free trade platform and with seeking
votes disguised as a protectionist.
Caminetti said Taylor was a member
of Congress when the "Wilson-Gorman
blli was adopted and at that time he
voted to put on the free list the three
great industries of the First Congres
sional District, viz.": Lumber, cattle
and wool. . -
Taylor grilled Caminetti unmercifully
as the legislator who put a two-cent
duty on a "six-bit business" and re
moved a $2 duty from a $6,000,000 in
dustry. If you trust this, man again,
said the speaker, you know what to
expect.
The remarks of Taylor were greeted
with prolonged applause.

.."It is only a question of the size of
the plurality the ticket will receive,"
said he to-day. "The people are satis
fled with existing conditions and want
a continuance of , them. Despite" the
claims of the C Democratic party the
people will not be fooled into doing
something which their good common
sense shows them would be a mistake.
They will poll their Republican ticket
this year of all years. There Is not
the slightest danger of our losing any
of the Northern States and we may get
some Southern ones." '
LOS ANGELES, Nov.. 4.â That the
Republican national ticket will receive
an unprecedented popular vote and se
cure a record-breaking plurality is the
prediction of David B. Henderson, for
mer Speaker of the House of Repre
sentatives, who arrived here yesterday
to spend the winter. The distinguished
Iowa statesman has retired from ac
tive political work, but he keeps in
touch with political events and Is so
well Informed upon political subjects
as to be considered an authority.

NEW YORK, Nov. 4. â A thick
blanket of fog, which settled down over.
New York City and harbor during the
night, seriously disarranged traffic
both by land and water to-day and re
sulted in at least one serious. accident.
The ferry-boat Columbia of the Wall-
Street Line wtfs run into and sunk. by
the Norwich liner Â¦ City of Lowell.
There were ' about 150 passengers [ and
seventeen teams on board the Colum
bia. All of the passengers were taken
off In safety, but eight or ten of the
horses'were drowned.
The 'City of Lowell was coming down
the river and in the dense . fog struck
the Columbia amidships, . just clear of
the paddlewhecL The Columbia floated
.around for a while and began to settle.
A hawser was thrown from the City
of Lowell and the Columbia made fast
and all the passengers were : taiken* on
board the â¢' steamboat. Later the haw
ser parted in some unaccountable man
ner, and the * Columbia finally sank
near one of the slips of the Union Fer
ry Company on the Brooklyn side.
The Garden City, a ferry-boat plying
between Long Island City and New
York, collided during the fog seven
times with various craft before she
reached' her slip in this city. She
bumped into the big Sound steamer
Maine and a hole was stove in the fer
ry-boat's side.' The hole was far above
the water line, however, and the ferry
boat did not sink. The Garden City
had 100 passengers.

The hearing. will be resumed this af-
The Chinese puzzle of "who's the
widow" in the Chew 'Bing Quoia case
now on hearing in Judge Coffey's court
Involves some delicate questions. One
is whether an American court will take
cognizance of ,marriage customs -in
China if there is no written law and
another is the acceptance of oral.testi
mony on those customs if there ; is a
written" law. and it is possible to obtain
a verified copy thereof. â¢Â¦ - .
'On account of other, engagements In
the court, yesterday's hearing only oc
cupied a little over' an â¢ hour, J but' the
most distinguished and most gorgeous
ly arrayed Oriental who , has yet ap
peared in the case was called: to the
stand. . This was Ng Tow Chow, .age
fifty-seven, who .was summoned; from
the. Flowery Kingdom- a -year "ago to
accept the assistant -presidency -of the
Kong Chow,- one ofthe Six Companies.
The. dignitary, wore fan .dive 'green
blouse) lavender skirt, *a thin' mustache
and^scantei 5 ' imperial' and" his head. was
shiningly shaved back to 'the very^ roots
of his queue. He^wasj called *tori the
sole purpose of explaining the marriage
customsin his district in China, which
Is the one that Chew Bing Quoia' hailed
from. Unfortunately "Attorneys Vogel
sang and Hill were in an \ argumenta
tive mood and the witness was only,
permitted to., say that ' the marriage
laws were riot printed, but are. handed
down , from. , 'dynasty to dynasty" at
Â¦Peking..'. {â¢ ..'Â¦.- ..Â¦Â¦''. '\ r ''J
Attorney*/ Hill,": who represents J.^j.
Cunningham, the. administrator, ''whose
removal : is sought by. Qucia's. widow; in
China, . was of the; opinion; that Ng' Tow
Chow should not tell of the ; traditional
marriage laws,* but' that ' the : other side
should produce the" copy of some ruling
of a Chinese court. -'Mr. Vogelsang, at
.torney for the ,â¢ petitioners : for'- Cun-,
ningham's removal," declared that he
arid .Judge Dibble; had read . numerous
volumes on^the/subject, and -were pre-"
pared V.tb^ .pfoyej-. that '; there '.were .no
written* laws on marriage^ and,: further
more, no i lawyers V in - Chiha'^ and
Judges there did' not v necessarily., have
to. know theilaw.. This caused; Judge
Coffey to remark" that there, was no
noise in Chinese; courts. ;

Special Revenue Agent Bert M.
Thomas, with two assistants, is mak
ing a thorough examination of the
books and, accounts of the office. He
said yesterday that he did not expect
to be through before next Thursday.
Every v letter sent to the revenue of
fice during the last year is to be'scru
tinized and the. accounts are to, be
consulted to see whether ; the; Bums
named | have been paid and deposited
in the United States treasury.
With regard to the defalcation: of
the former chief deputy Thomas de
clined to say anything save that he
would wait until District Attorney
Woodworth returns from the country
before taking any . steps ' toward
Wright's prosecution. Agent Thomas
was closeted with an assistant district
attorney for half an hour' in the fore
noon and also with George W.Hazen,
United States secret service agent in
charge of the office here. It was
whispered later that close . watch was
to be ' kept on the movements 'of
Wright and of one or two -others
pending the arrests, which are ex
pected to follow- next week.
' Suspicion 'was first directed toward
Wright by the fact that, ha seemed to
be living beyond his means, and never
to want for money. He marrledabout
a year ago an estimable young woman
and expects to become a father 'at' any
time within the next week. He still
persists in declaring his innocence and
stoutly maintains that he has not been
guilty ' of Government
