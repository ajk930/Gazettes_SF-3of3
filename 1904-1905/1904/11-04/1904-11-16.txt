NEW YORK, Nov. 15. â "Dismissed by
President Roosevelt on charges of scan
dalous conduct and for the .good of the
service," was the announcement which
came from Washington to-day as an
anti-climax In the suit for breach of
promise brought by Mrs. Fannie Foss,
a pretty cloak model, against Surgeon
Charles B. D. Lord of the United
States public health and marine hos
pital service..
The sweet revenge for which Mrs.
Foss declared she sued came more
quickly than she had dreamed. The
breach of promise action had nothing to
do /with the dismissal, which had been
determined upon before the suit was
brought.
The charges against Dr. Lord related
to his conduct In San Francisco, it was
asserted, where he first met Mrs. Foss.
On Monday she filed her suit for $50,000
for a broken heart.
It was learned to-day that Dr. Lord
has a wife in Biddeford, Maine, who
was Mrs. Annie Ingersoll before her
marriage to the handsome young sur
geon. Mrs. iiord, with her mother-in
law, was in New York a few days ago.
Upon their return to Maine tb-day they
declared the suit for breach of promise
was ; a blackmailing scheme. Richard
Ingersoll, Dr. Lord's father-in-law, has
announced his x purpose of coming to
New York to help fight the suit. : ..
Mrs. Foss said to-day:
"I am through with gold lace and

Attorney Pillsbury led Mrs. Elizabeth
C Phillips through a Ibng^nd search
ing cross-examination yesterday morn
ing concerning her interviews with the
executors of Bertha Dolbeer's will for
the purpose of inducing them to pay
her a bonus of $15,000, to be added to
her -bequest of $10,000. It was brought
out with the force of greater detail that
she made the strong suggestion to' them
that if she should testify in behalf of
thfÂ» contestant Schander she would
give much aid to his case.
While Mrs. Phillips had sought to Im
press on the executors that her testi
mony would be dangerous to the will
and that it would be valuable for the
contestant, she was not so solicitous
concerning her own legacy of $10,000.
Her explanation en the stand was that
she was under oath, must tell the truth
concerning Miss Dolbeer's mental con
dition, no matter whether she would be
deprived of her bequest of $10,000 or
not.
MAKES STOIJT DENIAL.
Attorney Pillsbury finally put the
question bluntly:
Hav e you no contract with the contestant
that you are to receive the amount of your
legacy If Uie will Is broken?
I have none.
Have you no understanding with thÂ« con
testant as to what you shall receive?
I have not. I think I answered that yes
ttrday when I aeUd I had neither been bought
nor scld. .,
A flashlight photograph of the hall
way on the ninth floor in the Waldorf-
Astoria Hotel, showing the window
through which Miss Dolbeer suddenly
disappeared and fell to her death
on July 9 last was Introduced in
evidence yesterday and shown to
the jury. The window is but
two feet from the floor. Miss Dolbeer
was standing on a smooth marble slab,
which is a part of the rioor, and her
footing was therefore somewhat uncer
tain. It being very easy to slip.
On the opening of court in the morn
ing the cross-examination of Mrs. Phil
lips proceeded as follows:
Did you not tell Mr. Mugan that you would
compel MiM Warren to disgorge $25,000 before
you cot through with the case?
I did not.
â¢ Was no mention made of $25,000? ,
YÂ«s. I thought I was talking confidentially
to a friend who sympathized with me and I
told him I thoucht It was very unjust that
Miss Warren's mother, whom Miss Dolbeer
hardly knew, ehould have ?26.000 while I, who
"had helped to rear the eirl and was of kin.
waa left only $10,000.
â¢ Did you say to Mr. Mugan that Miss Warren
would have to give you 116.000 in addition
to your, bequest or you would see to It that
â¢he didn't set the property? ,
I did not. I told him that I could j easily
break the will If I would tell what I knew of
Miss Dolbeer. but I made no threats
Did you go to Mr. Johnson, attorney for
the . contestant. Schander, or did he come to
you in the first. Dlace?
Mr. Johnson telephoned to me and asked
if he might pee me. I told him I would see
him. '
What did you tell him?
I told him nothing. I fished around to ascer
tain what evidence he had on which to base
his case. He was not transparent, however.
He seemed to be fishing to get something- out
or me, but he didn't.
At subsequent Interviews with the
attorneys she had discussed the testi
mony she would give.
Attorney Pillsbury plied the witness
with questions concerning a visit she
made to Executor Mugan, at which
time she plainly stated her grievances.
She first protested against allowing
Miss Warren to occupy the Dolbeer
home on Pacific avenue. She also com
plained to him because he had held up
Miss Warren at the funeral of Miss
Dolbeer, showing her much deference,
while ignoring others who were of kin.
The witness also found fault with Mu
gan because he had given her no ad
vice as to investment of money, while
he had favored Miss Warren very
much in this regard.
Thomas Saywell, a gardener, was
called for the contestant to testify
concerning the death of Mrs. Dolbeer,
mother of testatrix, in 1879. He i was
the first to break into the room where
the bodv lay. with a bullet wound In
the temple and a pistol at her side, r

JILTS FIANCE
FOR ANOTHER
Reports were circulated to-night that
Pelletan, Rouvier and Maruejols- are
likely to resign the portfolios of the
Ministries of Marine, Finance and Pub
lic Works, respectively, but there is no
confirmation of these rumors. Conser
vative opinion is that the Cabinet will
be strengthened by the removal of the
chief source of the present discord.
News of the resignation of Andre
created a sensation, owing to the in
tensity of the recent controversy. The
opposition to the Minister hailed the
resignation as a 1 great victory, which
would speedily lead to the fall of the
entire Ministry.
"While proud of the work to which
I have devoted my best energies," Gen
eral Andre wrote, "I "have too much
love for my country and the republic
to accept for one moment the hypo
thesis that I am' the cause of disunion
within the Republican majority. It is
by the united action of this majority
that the Ministries of WaJdeck-Rous
seau and Combes have saved the repub
lic from the perils confronting them,
and it is thanks to this continued union
that the Republican party will achieve
the gTeat task before it."
The letter concludes with affection
ate adieus to General Andre's col
leagues and thanks for their co-opera
tion.
Premier Combes laid the letter be
fore the Cabinet meeting, and an agree
ment was speedily arrived at to invite
Berteaux to succeed Andre. The Pre
mier presented Berteaux to President
Loubet at 6 o'clock this evening and
the announcement of the chance was
thereupon officially made.
PARIS, Nov. 15.â General Andre re
signed the portfolio of Minister of War
and Henry Berteaux, a member of the
Chamber of Deputies, and a successful
broker on the Bourse, was nominated
as his successor to-day.
This change in -the Ministry is the
culmination of fierce assaults upon the
administration of the War Office, in the
course of which the Chamber of Dep
uties was the scene of^ frequent wild
disorders,' including the recent. personal
assault upon General Andre;;_".These
events stirred ?r^publle^a^high pitch
ot-eTciternerni/r'pftrticu^arly army and
political circles, where succession of
duels evidenced the bitterness. General
Andre reached thfi . decision to resign
only this morning, and immediately dis
patched a letter to Premier Combes.
The t&tt of this letter, which was giv
en'out to-ni^ht. asserts that the at
tacks against the War Office were
merely a device of enemies of the
Government' to undermine the republic.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 15.â News was
received in Washington to-day which
shows that a conspiracy was recently
directed against President Amador of
Panama. It was the purpose of the
plotters to seize President Amador,
throw him into prison and assume con
trol of the Government. President
Amador learned of the plot and frus
trated the plan.
As a result of these advices, the State
Department has requested the % Navy
Department to keep a warship in isth
mian waters. The cruiser Dixie, now at
Colon, will remain there until further
orders.
There is a tendency In some quarters
here to believe, that the conspiracy had
in part the purpose of putting Panama
affairs in a turmoil before the arrival
there of Secretary Taft. Until after
Taft's mission is concluded, the bat
talion of marines now on the Â¦ isthmus
will not.be withdrawn. It ls the desire
of Secretary Taft that everything In

MARQUISE DES MONSTIERS.
Dear Editor: It may Interest some of
your readers to know that the Marquise des
Mongtlers-Merinville, formerly Miss M. Q.
Caldwell, who. it will be remembered, founded
the Roman Catholic University at 'Washington
seme years ago. has entirely repudiated her
former creed.
The statement that the Marquise
founded the Washington University is
erroneous. She did, however, contrib
ute $300,000 for the erection of the di
vinity school connected with that in
stitution.
The Marquise des Monstiers-Merin
ville and her sister, the Baroness von
Zoodwltz, are the daughters of the late
William S. Caldwell and his wife, who
was a Breckinridge of Kentucky.
Shortly before his death Caldwell be
came a convert to Roman Catholicism
and left his children to the care of
Roman Catholics in New York, whom
his wife had met In church circles. The
younger sister married some fifteen
years ago a German nobleman, a Luth
eran, and has since then also -left the
Roman Catholic communion. The elder
has been in very bad health for some
years.
On the death of her father, Mary
Gwendolin Caldwell inherited $2,000,000.
On October 19, 1896, Miss Caldwellwas
married to the Marquis des Monstlers-
Merinville, a French nobleman. In St.
Joseph's Church, Avenue Hoche, Paris,
by Bishop Spalding of Peoria, 111., the
guardian and administrator of the es
tate of Miss Caldwell, assisted by
Father Cooke.
At the time of her marriage, Miss
Caldwell was a very handsome woman,
about 35 years old, and a devoted Ro
man Catholic. Seven years previous to
her marriage Miss Caldwell was en
gaged to Prince Murat, grandson of the
King of Naples. The engagement was
broken because the Prince Insisted that
half of Miss Caldwell's fortune should
be settled upon him.

Cathollo University In Washington ls

MERCE1?, Nov. 15.â A local paper is
responsible for the statement that il
legal claims upon Merced County have
been presented by Superintendent
Smith of the Whittier Reform School,
and that charges have been drawn up
against that official and forwarded to
the Governor at Sacramento. The State
law provides that the county from
which boys are committed to the re
form school shall pay $11 per month for
each person committed during the time
they remain at the school. County
Auditor Cook, it is said, claims to have
discovered that Smith has presented
claims against the county for an allow
ance for two boys who are not now in
mates of the Institution and who have
not been such since August 15 last.
The two boys in question are Robert
and "Dock" Shaw. They were commit
ted to Whittier from this county in Sep
tember, 1902, since which time it is said
the county has paid $11 a month for
each of them, upon monthly statements
by the superintendent or the school to
the effect that the boys were still there.
Recently it is said Auditor Cook
learned that the Shaw boys were in
Fresno. He went to see tnem and se
cured their affidavits stating that they
were released (not paroled nor dis
charged) from the Whittier School
August 15. The claims ror August and
September, it is claimed, were filed Just
the same, and the claim for October
maintenance Is now on file, together
with a statement that the boys were
paroled October 31. The boys returned
from Fresno to Merced County to live
on the 8th of this month.
The older of the two boys. It Is
claimed, also makes affidavit that for
five months prior to August 15, when
he was given permission to go to Fres
no, he worked for a farmer near Whit
tier named E. R.' Gulardo, and that he
saw Giiiardo give Superintendent Smith
a check for $50 for his services. During
those five months he visited the school
but once, and then only stayed one
night.
AudltoT Cook, it is averred, fortified
by affidavits proving all these asser
tions, Bent a letter to Governor Pardee
to-day, laying the facts before the ex
ecutive and requesting that an Investi
gation be made.

On her. return, she gave a most fas
cinating description of the picturesque
life of the Italian Robin Hoods. And
thus ls manifested the restless, ad
venturous spirit of her who has made
nations marvel.
; Perhaps the most dramatic Incident
of her, dramatic career was the death
of Valentine Gadesden In London.
One soft summer night, as she sat
at the piano singing a sweet lullaby,
with Gadesden by her side, each hap
py in the presence of the other, the
tragedy of her career occurred.
The song: over, she turned to her
companion, only to" find that he had
sunken to the floor and her song had
fallen upon unheeding ears.
Screaming, she caught him up In her
arms, called to him to speak to her, to
open his eves once more to hers, but
the appeal was vain, for death had
stolen from her the man she loved,
even, while she sang. And when in the
morning her servants appeared they
found their mistress wan and dishev
eled upon the floor, holding In her arms
the cold form of her devoted .friend.
"Go!" she cried, as they entered, "Go
and tell all the world that Gadesden
Is dead." â¢
It was during this spell of weari
ness that the vivacious American
learned of the presence of a band of
brigands in the mountains that rose to
the east* and rumor had It that the
chief I of the band was a picturesque
Neapolitan, handsome, brave and ten
der to women.
Here was a respite to a restless
spirit.
Before the day broke, mistress, /maid
and man-servant, 'with provisions,
clothing and a few trinkets for gifts,
had set out for the brigand camp.
j When the carriage approached the
fastnesses of the banditti, Lady Yarde-
Buller alighted, advanced alone toward
the astonished outlaws and extended
her hand to them In friendly greeting.
Not many minutes elapsed, before the
handsome chief had greeted his fair
visitor, warmly, bidding her welcome to
the camp and extending its hospitali
ties. With alacrity, she accepted the
proffered courtesies, and with her maid
and man-servant, remained in the for
est home of the outlaws for a week.

temperament had . full swing. In Flor

and courted and seemingly was weary-

AWES THE BAXDIT CHIEF.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15.â Prince
Sadanaru Fushimi, a near relative of
the Emperor of Japan, who has ar
rived in Washington as the guest of
the nation, to-day called at the White
House and conveyed to the President
the good wishes and friendship of the
Mikado and the latter's hope for the
President's good health and happiness.
The Prince's address, which was in
Japanese and interpreted by one of
Â¦his suite, was brief and bespoke closer
stronger relations between the two
countries. The President, in his re
sponse, gave assurances that this sen
timent is shared by the American peo
ple and wished the Japanese people
prosperity.
Shortly before 10 o'clock Prince Fu
shimi and his suite were driven from
the Arlington Hotel to the White
House. The Prince occupied the state
carriage of the Japanese legation, Mr.
Peirce and Mr. Hlokl riding with him.
The suite consisted of A. Sato, grand
master of the Prince's household;
Count S. Terashima, Major Mlhara.
Mr. Watanabe, master of ceremonies
of the Emperor of Japan; Dr. K. Rok
ku, physician to the Prince, and Sho
shunka Matsuka, third secretary of the
Japanese legation, who met the Prince
at San Francisco.
GREETED AT WHITE HOUSE.
, Prince Fushimi was attired in the
uniform of a lieutenant general of the
Japanese army. The other members of
his suite wore uniforms pf their grade
in the army or diplomatic corps.
As the carriage of the party, headed
by a platoon of mounted police, swept
into the porte cochere of the White
House It was met by Colonel Charles
S. Bromwell, the military aid, and
Captain Campon Marslow, the naval
aid of President Roosevelt. Assistant
Secretary Pelrce presented the Prince
to them and the party then was con
ducted Into the White House. The
Prince and his suite were ushered Into
the Blue Room, where in a few min
utes President Roosevelt, accompanied
by Assistant Secretary of State Fran
cis B. Loomis and Secretary Loeb,
greeted them. The greeting between
the Preeldent and Prince Fushimi was
cordial.
COURTESIES EXCHANGED.
The presentations were made by Mr.
Peirce. Prince Fushimi said In part:
His Majestey, the Emperor of Japan, charged
me to convey to you his earnest desire that
the historic relations of amity and j^od feel
ing, which have always, alnoe the Â«rkys of
Commodore Perry, united the great republic
of the West with the empire of the legendary
East, and which have contributed In no Ismail
measure to the progress and prosperity of
Japan, may grow still closer and stronger with
the passing years, and I assure you, Mr. Presi
dent, that I believe I Interpret the sentiment
of my countrymen when I add that the words
of his Majesty flnd a ready echo In the hearts
of his Majesty's loyal subjects.
The President's response' was as fol
lows:
It gives me unfeigned pleasure to meet your
Imperial highness and to hear from yon thÂ»
expression of the friendly words of his Ma
jesty, the Emperor, and of the people of Japan
toward the United States of America. I as
sure you that these sentiments an* reciprocated
by me and by the American people. Ever
since the empire of Japan â at the invitation
of this country â entered upon the career of
modern and International progress which has
led to such brilliant results the relations of the
two countries have been those of unbroken
friendship. I pray that these relations may
continue forever, growing: always more friend
ly and more- extended, ana I trust that this
visit of your Imperial highness may result in
that Increase of mutual good will between this
republic and the empire of Japan which will
naturally come from more intimate acquaint
ance and wider knowledge of each other.
I beg you to convey to his Majesty, the
Emperor of Japan, my grateful appreciation
of his valued expressions of amity and my
best wishes for his health and happiness and
the prosperity of the Japanese people.
A GUEST AT DIXXER.
The President and Prince Fushimi
then chatted animatedly for ten min
utes. Their conversation was conduct
ed through an interpreter and related
principally to Japanese history and lit
erature, with incidental reference to
the Russo-Japanese war, In which
Prince Fushimi has played a conspic
uous part. The Prince expressed him
self as pleased and surprised at the
knowledge the President showed of
these subjects.
Prince Fushimi and his party left the
White House under escort of Colonel
Symons. The President later returned
the call of Prince Fushimi, driving
from the White House to the Arlington
Annex In an open carriage surrounded
by policemen on bicycles. Accompany
ing the President were his secretary,
Mr. Loeb, and his military aids.
After the President left the Prince
took an automobile ride over the city,
escorted by Colonel Symons and Mr.
Pelrce. At the White House to-night
the Prince was the guest of honor at a
dinner given by the President. No
ladles were present

CHICAGO, Nov. 15.â Air possibility
of a peaceful settlement of the war
fare In the Prohibition party was de
stroyed to day through charges by
John G. Woolley and other Prohibition
leaden*, made in Woolley's publication.
This followed Oliver W. Stewart's.ac
tion In bringing suit for $5000 against
William E. Johnson. The latter is as
sociated with Woolley In the publish
ing business. He is accused by thÂ«
chairman of the Prohibition National
Committee of having slandered him.
Accepting the challenge Woolley has
come forth with an attack of six print
ed pages directed against his neighbor
and fellow temperance worker, charg
ing Stewart with having wrecked tha
Presidential campaign conducted by
the party. Secrets of the Prohibition
ists are given to the world, including
the Information that Dr. Swallow, who
ran on the ticket for President of the
United States, "has been trudging
about the country on a campaign tour,
footing the expense bills with borrowed
money and acting as a collector of
campaign funds for the chairman."
Aside from the treatment of the Pres
idential candidate at the hands of thÂ»
advocates of temperance and the pov
erty stricken variety of campaign he
was forced to make, it is disclosed that
there has long been so little harmony
in the ranks of the leaders that a
"peace committee" was established to
endeavor to maintain tranqulllty. A.
A. Stevens, chairman of this body; Dr.
Samuel Dickie, national treasurer of
the party, and vice chairman A. G.
Wolfenbargcr are cited as having "re
vised, corrected and approved" the at
tack and expose. In It at Iea3t 515.00O
of the total campaign fund of $52,000 is
alleged to having been dissipated tn
"schemes and personal vengeance and

it reaches England, will revive in the

woman figured in an interesting way
at the British -court, where, she was
often favored by attention from the
same -Prince of Wales who is now
King of Gr,eat Britain.
General Kirkham came to California
in the early days, shortly after- his re
tirement from the army, and here he
amassed a fortune, which finally
passed to his two daughters. Mary
Leilah Kirkham became the wife of
Boyle Blair, who, as an attache of the
British diplomatic service, was making
a tour of the world and. while stopping:
over in San Francisco, enjoying 'the
hospitality of the Bohemian Club, .met
and wooed the pretty maiden of Oak
land. Their honeymoon terminated in
London, where the handsome Mrs.
Blair quickly attracted attention by
her beauty and brilliancy of wit. and
was soon welcomed into the most ex
clusive of society.
In the midst of her social glory
news came that Blair had died, and
a few months later the cable heralded
the announcement of the fair young
"widow's marriage to Walter Yarde-
Buller, the brother, of Lord Church
ston. to whose title he finally succeed
ed, thus bestowing upon his bride the
rank of a lady at court. Lady Yarde-
Buller's second marriage was not a
happy one. Although she strove hard
to make' herself a pleasing mate to
her lord, he soon tired of his matri
monial adventure. They separated
and as the months passed It became
public knowledge In London that the
young wife was slowly learning to love
another, a man whom she had pre
viously met in this country, a design
ing fellow, who had delighted in prey
ing on women and had successfully
preyed upon the misguided one from
Oakland. Valentine Gadesden was his
name, and it was his name that fin
ally was associated with that of Lady
Yarde-Buller In the suit for divorce
brought by her husband.
COURT GRANTS DIVORCE.
The suit of her husband was the
beginning of tedious litigation, in one
branch of which she contracted the
cold that - caused her death. There
were emphatic denials upon the part
of Lady Yarde-Buller and counter

charges as to the amounts of money
involved in settlements upon both
sides. . In the midst :ot the long-drawn
out troubles General Kirkham died
and shortly afterward Gadesden passed
away. , With Â«the death of these two a
portion of the litigation ceased, but
only to* branch out in new directions.
The separation betwen Lady Yarde-
Buller and her husband became com
plete under order of the English
courts; Lord Yarde"-BUller went from
London to South Africa in the British
service and Lady Yarde-Buller "took
up her. residence in Oakland with her
two children by her first husband.
Troubles multiplied and the woman
who was once the reigning belle of
London regal society passed into the
custody . of the courts of Alameda
County and a guardian was appointed.
There have .been several guardians at
different times and there has been
endless litigation . over the custody of
her ladyship, and her estate. No
â¢ sooner would one guardian be ap
â¢pointed by the court than contests'
would be begun by others who thought
they should be in charge of the person
and the property of Lady Yarde-
Biiller. Finally, she \ became seized
with a desire to control her own prop
erty and she brought suit to be re
stored to competency.
PLEADS HER OWN CASE. \
The trial a week ago was remarkable
In several ways. Lady Yarde-Buller
made her own plea to the jury and bo
well did she : . succeed that it took a
mass of expert testimony to show that,
while thoroughly competent in the or
dinary sense of the word, she was at
the same time morally irresponsible.
Her own son testified to this effect,,
and yet remained with his mother
every day during the trial, the most
loving affection existing between them.
Lady Yarde-Buller was again remand
ed to the care of Mr. "Wright as her
guardian and Dr. Robertson. These
two had agreed that upon Thanksglv-,
ing day she should be allowed a great- 1 .
er measure of liberty than before.
There is still about $250,000 of. her share
of the old Kirkham fortune, that will
go to her heirs. One son is dead, and
the other, Ralph Blair, 5 will come in 1
for what is left. Besides this son, , she'
leaves one sister in Oakland.
Lady Yarde-Buller's life was. filled
with many exciting , incidents, notable
among which was one in Italy. While
her beauty was yet "at its height, she

The delegates representing the trade3
unions of the United States presented"
more than fifty resolutions to* the ex
ecutive council at yesterday's session.
These were in turn referred, for action
to the various committees appointed
by President Gompers.
W. J. Gilthorpe and A. F. Porter,
representing the Brotherhood of Boil
ermakers and Iron Shin Builders, intro
duced a resolution preferring charges
of violating the federation ' constitution
against President Gompers, Secretary
Morrison and the executive council,' in-,
eluding Vice Presidents James , Dun
can, John Mitchell, J. O'Connell, Max
Morris, D. Hayes and John B. Lennon.
The charge is that the officers issued
a charter to the Bridge and Structural
Ironworkers, violating a section of the
federation constitution, which says
that all applications for. charters shall
be. referred to closely allied crafts for
inspection and correction. The charter
was delivered by the officers despite
the protest of the' boilermakers and a
dual organization along the same lines
is the result.'";"
Federal Union No. 9611 petitioned the
federation to urge active legislation
for- the exclusion of the Japanese and
Chinese.
The Portland Federation Trades
MANY RESOLUTIONS.
delegate from the Florists' and Garden
ers' Union of Chicago. The committee
on credentials recommended that he
should be seated. Delegate Spencer de
clared that Mangan was not a florist
and gardener, but that he really was a
member of the Steamfitters' Union of
Chicago, a body that has been discred
ited by the federation, and that there
was trickery in the case. After some
talk It was voted to give Manga'n the
privilege of the floor of the convention
to make a statement. Mangan said he
did not care to speak and that he would
be contented to have the matter re
ferred, back to the committee on cre
dentials.
President Gompers then spoke in fa
vor of referring the entire matter back
to the committee on credentials. This
was done.
.Delegate Tanquaray objected to the
seating of B. Cohn, the delegate from
Kewanee, 111., on the ground that Cohn
lives in Chicago and is not a member
of the Kewanee Central Union. This
protest also went back to the committee
on credentials. After some discussion
the delegates of the structural iron
workers were seated, there being only
one vote in dissent, that one being by
W. F. Gilthorpe.
The committee on the president's re
port recommended indorsement of the
suggestion that a committee shall be
appointed to confer with the Typo
graphical Union in reference to an
eight-hour day; and that the sugges
tion regarding the defense fund should
be referred to the proper committee.
Fraternal Delegate John H. Richards
of Montreal made a. short speech and
a report relating to the labor movement
in Canada was submitted.
Some time was devoted to discussing
the report of the committee on rules
and order of f business. It was decided
to have no half-holiday for the conven
tion on Saturdays. The daily conven
tion hours were fixed to be from 9 a. m.
to noon and from 2 p. m. to 5:30 p. m.
President Gompers read a telegraphic
report which was In substance that an
eight-hour day and a minimum daily
wage of ?3 had been agreed to by the
owners of mines In the Telluride, Colo.,
district, and said: "Despite occasional
setbacks that may occur the future is
ours."
While the committee on credentials
was making its supplementary report
President Gompers, seeing that there
was a chance for more or less acri
mony. Judiciously called John Mitchell
to the chair and went down on the
floor of the convention and there found
ample use for skill in smoothing over
difficulties. This was the first time
that . John Mitchell has been in the
chair during the convention. Like
Gompers. he- has a prosperous.appear
ance. He is several years younger than
Gompers. He sported a pink carna
tion on the lapel of his black coat. A
diamond ring sparkled on his left hand.
His attire was given variety by a gray
waistcoat- He used the gavel to call
the convention to order much more
sparingly than does Gompers. He was
in the chair some; hours.
Next to the Schardt case the contro
versy about the right of A. F. Mangan
to sit as a delegate drew the most fire.
Mancan came to the convention as a
MITCHELL PRESIDES.
Schardt is prepared to fight for rec
ognition, notwithstanding that the
committee on credentials has turned
him down in a report submitted yes
terday. A warm contest on the floor of
the convention is therefore one of the
expected features of the proceedings
to-day.
Yesterday afternoon the convention
adjourned its general deliberations aft
er a short session. President Gompers
reported that resolutions had been re
ceived for consideration. Secretary
Morrison held up a thick bunch of res
olutions and was about to read them
when the plan was changed. An'In
vitation was given to all who had res
olutions that they wished to present
to turn them in to the committee on
resolutions.
In less than an hour after the aft
ernoon session was called to order the
floor of the convention hall was turned
Into a great committee room and a ma
jority of the regular committees were
engaged In hearing suggestions, com
plaints, resolutions and generally get
ting In hand the preliminaries of the
business that is to be transacted at
the present convention.
At the afternoon session of the con
vention Michael Davitt. the Irish lead
er, was escorted to the stage of the
convention by a committee. There he
was greeted with cries of "Davitt, Da
vitt, speech, speech." Davitt -spoke
very briefly and expressed sympathy
with the federation.
Vice President Duncan reported thr
doings of the executive committee of
the federation during twelve months.
The report was so long that the read-
Ing took the greater part of the fore
noon. The committee on rules submit
ted a code for the government of the
convention. It was adopted.
Many dissensions were revealed In
attempts to unseat some of those who
were present as delegates, the basis of
which was found in supplementary re
ports of the committee on credentials.
After a brief discussion it was decided
that the most interesting contest or
all, that involving the seating of Wil
liam G. Echardt. president of the Chi
cago Federation of Labor, shall be
brought up before the convention this
forenoon.
The American Federation of Labor
temporarily dropped speech making
yesterday and began to pave the way
for the transaction or me real busi
ness of the twenty-fourth annual con
vention.
The matter of leading interest sub
mitted, yesterday to the convention of

SCENES IN TFIE CONVENTION OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND DELEGATES WHO ARE DAILY IN ATTENDANCE AT DELIBERATIONS.
' Gompers spoke of the decision of an
Illinois court which declared the Illegal
ity of the contract between labor
unions and employers. He said that
until the Supreme Court of the United
States had passed upon that contract it
could not be declared illegal. He said:
"I have the greatest respect for the
Supreme Court of the United States,
but it once rendered a Dred Scott de
cision of which we are not proud. It
is composed of human beings like our
selves. I come to you to preach the
gospel that you be true to the cause of
unionism. Be proud to be a workman
vfith your diploma of honor In your
clear card of membership in your
union. You are the grand army of
peace. To you it is given to work
out the solution of the greatest problem
In the world's history. This great labor
movement cannot die out. It cannot be
crushed out. Work and pray, pray and
work that success shall usher in the
day whose full noon sun shall proclaim
"Deace on earth, good will to man."
"The workman has the duty first to
perform a fair day's work and he ought
to have an Influential voice in de
termining what a fair day's work con
sists of. The trades unions do not limit
output. The trades unions do limit the
hours of labor and expect during the
hours of employment that the work
man shall give a fair day's work. It
comes with bad grace from the employ
ers of the United States to charge that
the trades unions limit and restrict the
output when it is borne in mind that in
the whole world the workmen do not
work with half the speed and the skill
of our American workmen. It comes
with ill grace, I say for such a charge
to be made In the light of this fact."
"It was not eo long ago that when a
workman discussed questions touching
his hours cf employment, his labor or
what not along this line he was brand
ed with an iron, cast into prison and
hanged. If it is the Idea of the Citi
zens' Alliance to crush out the spirit
of organized labor they ought to have
begun with our grandparents. Men
and women have come to learn that
these mean and little-minded people
foolishly think they can crush them
out. The struggles of labor have been
from time immemorial, but in our time
the struggle has taken on new form.
Now the worker uses his reason and his
intelligence.
John B. Lennon was cordially re
ceieved. He sajd he had met many trade,
unionists who seemed discouraged
over the situation. But the speaker
asserted that as a fact to-day there
was a better understanding of the real
meaning of labor unionism than ever
before In the thirty years he had been
a union man. He thought the agita
tion about the "open shop" had 1m
ptlled workingmen to solidify them
selves. In his own trade â Journeyman
tailor â there were more union shops
than a year ago. He insisted that the
"open shop" means a "closed shop" to
all labor unionists. Said he: "The
father of the open shop, D. M. Parry,
could not have had a hearing if trades
unionism did not exist and exist to
*ome purpose. I cannot understand
the economic theory of the man who
organizes to lower the wages of the
people upon whom he thrives.
"On this coast you have to be the
pickets to prevent the influx of cheap
labor from across the Pacific. We will
give you all the help we can. But it
is essentially the duty of the people
of California, Oregon and Washington
to make that fight. We depend upon
you to see that this country Is not
flooded with this Asiatic labor."
Great cheering followed the intro
duction of "the Little Giant of the
labor movement," as Samuel Gom
pers was styled by President Petry
when he escorted the leader to the
front of the platform.
Gompers said there was some satis
faction in trying to live the life in
which one believed. He declared it
was the lesson he was trying to in
culcate, that lesson in unionism of try
ing to help fellow men. He continued:
"The movement of organized labor is
so vast that much time would be nec
essary to present it. The enemies of
labor are constantly attempting to in
still the vires of prejudice and Ignor
ance in the minds of our fellow tollers.
You notice clearly ringing through all
of our speeches the advocacy of man
hood that shall make stalwart, intel
ligent men of the American working
man.
"I believe there is not an organiza
tion of men or women that can be so
easily persuaded to do the right as
organized labor. There is not an asso
ciation whose sympathy can be so eas
ily touched as the hearts of trades un
ionists. Labor has meekly submitted
to wrong, injustice, oppression and bru
tality for centuries.
"Colorado certainly has spoken, but
never so distinctly as California will if
it Is ever put to the test and has to
wipe out the anarchists in this Golden
Gate of ours.
"When the Citizens' Alliance takes it
upon itself to dictate to the employers
and to the employe I say that It is
more than the people of this country
will put up with, and the leaders of this
organization are destined to the great
est defeat that ever was meted out to
any set of men.
"Have you ever considered how much
better it would be for us who have to
eat and wear clothes and wear them
good If we made them ourselves? It
would do away with the strike and the
lockout, the boycott and the picket.
This is what we must look to for our
salvation, and when we get possession
of what we eat and what we wear we
won't care what the Citizens' Alliance
does during "its working hours."

I would never miss a chance to hear
them. /
"We who are in the trades union
movement on this coast have no apol

have no reason to hide having been in

hide the reason for which they had to

A FIXE MARCH.
Th<? march was down Broadway,
through Kighth street to Germania

composed of C. W. Petry. D. C. Craw
turd. \V. E. Berry, J. B. Bo wen, Joseph
Rebc-ii. J. Hooker. \V. Gray, E. Rem

In iho train uf the long line of march
ing esrorts was a throng of people that
oruvidtiti IT I 1 hi i in Ha.ll to tne limit of

â¢iiiaierue and made much demonstra
tion as speaker after speaker of na
tional pune was presented.
As aa overture, the consolidated
bands rendered a. symposium of patri
otic ami national airs. The platform
mu embellished with flowers, potted
Dl-ants and paJuis. a tastc-fui setting to
the score of unions" banners that
graced the Ftuge. President Petry
called the meeting to order in a grace
ful speech of welcome, during which
he referred to the honor that had
been dore Oakland by the presence of
the esteemed leaders who were here
to-night. Continuing, said Mr. Petry:
"On this â¢platform to-night there are
tr:en who are pioneers In the labor
world. They have grown prematurely
old and rrayhaired in the work for hu
manity, on behalf of the trades
unionists of Alameda County I thank
them for the crark they have done in
oehalf of the betterment cf the human
race. We owe them a debt of gratitude,
and it is with most heartfelt apprecia
tion cf that work that I and we, all
cf us, take pleasure in welcoming them
to Oakland.
URGES TENACITY.
'"Trades unionists of Oakland, give up
nothing for which you have fought.
Let me call your attention to the
golden rule of trades unionists, 'All for
one and one for all.* "
Chairman Petry introduced John P.
Mead of Brockton. Massachusetts, aa
the first speaker. Mr. Mead said:
"This audience indeed an inspira
tion, it demonstrates that trades
unionism moves, lives and has ltd be
ing. I was much Impressed with tht.
remarks of your chairman after read
ing the circular just read emanating
from the Citizens' Alliance. I do not
believe that the trades urions of this
country owe an apology for their ex
istence.
"I shall not attempt to discuss
trades uninniFm. I take it that you
have learned In that hard school of ex
perience the lesson which has now be
come old. I can only say with the late
Mr. Gladstone that 'the trades unions
are the bulwarks of modern democ- I
racy.' i
"There is only one more thing I want
to say. and I believe that this little ad
cress of mine would be left unfinished
if 1 did not say a word about the or
ganization of the purchasing power.
You to-day hardly realize the power
you have in your Â«wn hands in stand
ing together on the proposition of the
union label."
President Petry presented Frank K.
Foster of the International Typograph
ical Union from Massachusetts, who
said he was glad to have the oppor
tunity to exchange greetings with fel
low-trades unionists. Further Mr. Fos
ter said:
"Tiu- lime for apology for trades
unionism has long gone by. It has
justineci its existence by its elevation
o. humankind. It is constructive. The
old rule was that the wage earner
should bear all of the burdens of ex
istence. He must be blind who does not
know what trades unionism has con
tributed to humanity.

"It is an inspiration as we have trav- '

P. IJ. McCarthy, president of the
Building Trades Council of San Fran

Attorney Hosmer took the witness,
but up to the time of adjournment did
not shake her testimony. The case
will be resumed to-morrow morning.
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 15.â W. B.
Bradbury, the millionaire who was
held to answer In September on a
charge of criminal assault preferred
by his housekeeper, Mrs. C. Hanifln,
appeared for trial to-day before Judge
Lennon. Bradbury was represented by
Attorneys T. ; Kierullf and John Hos
mer. District Attorney Bovd is con
ducting the prosecution. Most of the
day was spent in securing a jury, the
panel not having been filled until 3
o'clock. Bradbury had ,with " him in
court a number of private detectives
and Detectives 'O'Dea and Mulcahy of
the San Francisco police.
The case was opened for the people
by District Attorney Boyd reciting
what the people expected to prove
against nradbury. Mrs. Catherine Han
ifln was called as a witness. She told
how she and her husband had been
employed by Bradbury, the husband
to oversee Bradbury's Tanch and she
to do the general housework. She said
that on August 20, about 6 o'clock In
the morning, the old man became gal
lant and tried to kiss her. She shook
him off, she said, and he, to placate
her, offered her $5 and told her to
hide It where "Eddie," her husband,
could not see It. This, said the witness,
she indignantly refused.
The old man came back later and
offered her a new dress, said Mrs. Han
inn, which she also refused. He then
left her. Later he returned to where
shd was working in the storeroom. "He
threw his arms violently around me,"
sa'd the witness, "and told me 'that

Judge' Lennon of Marin, whose
friends were anxious that he should

has announced himself as not being a
candidate fpr the office. 1 Judge Lennon
has, informed these friends that were
active in hls*behalf that he is better
satisfied where he is. Furthermore, he
says, he was elected to serve the people
of his . county for four years . and he
considers it his duty to show to them
his appreciation of. the confidence they
have reposed in him. Hence he will re

the most service for those that elected
him to the office he now holds.'

ONE FROM ALAMEDA.
"Hundreds, yes,' thousands, of the
Democrats that lent us their aid at the
election voted the Republican ticket on
November 8 ; last for the first time . in
their lives," said General Stone. "To
many it was like casting aside the re
ligion they learned at their mother's
knee to take up a strange one. Give
their good, act a chance to grow upon
them and in their consciences they will
soon find defenders for their aid of the
Republican cause. Don't let us crow
over these people that so splendidly
aided us and In time they will come
out into the open and admit that at
last they have found the light and have
emerged from the darkness of Demo
cratic philosophy."
Colonel Pippy's views were the same
as those of General Stone. The ques
tion of^-the ratification meeting was
discussed with them in every light and
in the end their views prevailed. So
there will be no blazing of flambeaux,
no blare of seventeen bands, no retell
ing of the oft-told tale of tariff and
gold, of progress and prosperity.
Among the' most prominent Jurists
yet to be mentioned for appointment to
the bench of the new District Courts
of Appeal is Judge W. E.- Greene of the
Superior. Court of Alameda County.
Judge Greene has been on the bench .for
twenty years and is favorably known
to every voter of his county.
General George Stone, chairman of
the Republican State Central Commit
tee and Colonel George H. Plppy, pres
ident of the Union League Club, were
opposed to the meeting and their line of
reasoning finally found the most ad
herents. It was pointed out by them
that the great victory of the Repub
lican party in California was not due
alone to the Republicans, but to a
great mass of Democrats that deflected
to the party of progress and will prob
ably stand by it in future years "if it
is not rubbed in too strong," as Gen
eral Stone put it.
GIVE THEM A CHANCE.
That the great victory of the Repub
lican party at the recent election was
a ratification in itself that should
satiate the desire of the most enthusi
astic member of the faith is the general
opinion, and, as a result, the proposed
parade and meeting of the victors has
been abandoned. Some of the members
of the Union League Club were in fa
vor of holding the celebration and were
active in making preparations when
other counsel prevailed and the plan
was dropped.

RATIFICATION
IS ABANDONED
ARDENT LOVE
OF BRADBURY
The sluicing of the ruins, which haa
been going on since Sunday, ceased
to-day. - Nothing of importance was
found. The . community here to-day
is no wiser than it was on last Thurs
day night when the brutal crime was
committed. . The shocking murder has
greatly upset and terrified many
women and children of the town and
houses are being closely guarded be
cause of the fear the crime has
aroused.
In speaking of the tragedy, J. M.
Lowell, an old time resident of Au
burn and a great friend of Julius We
ber, the murdered man, said: "I
knew Weber a long time. He was a
quiet, law-abiding, peaceful citizen.
He was very fond of his family.
Adolph was a puzzle to him. While I
cannot say that there was any enmity
existing between father and son,
there was always a certain strange
ness between them." .
AUBURX HOMES GUARDED.
"Weber was not the least bit ex
cited," savs Goldenberg. "In fact, he
was cooler than usual." : .
District Attorney A. K. Robinson
moved that the preliminary hearing
be held to-morrow morningr at 10
o'clock, and, this meeting with the
opproval of Adolph's attorney, It was
arranged that the hearing should go
en at that hour.
Nothing new was developed in the
case to-day, although It Is reported
that the District Attorney, Sheriff
Keena and Coroner Shepard have all
been placed in possession of valuable
evidence. The Coroner's Jury will meet
again to-morrow night, when Mrs.
Snowden, the aunt of Adolph, will go
upon the stand. So far she has had
very little to say, but there is no ques
tion but what she will prove a splen
did witness for the District Attorney.
The trousers that are supposed to have
been worn by Adolph on the night of
the tragedy prior to the burning of the
duelling, andt.whichT^wrtnrew into the
building through a window while the
fire was In progress .have been care-'
fully examined bv Dr. J. Francis
White. -The physician reports " that he
found stains upon the trousers, stains
made by human blood. Dr. White
made a most careful examination, but
he asked the District Attorney to send
the trousers to San Â¦ Francisco. This
was done and the garment is now be
ing, examined by an expert chemist of
that city. *m
Joseph GoldeWberg, the clerk in Co
hen's store, from whom Weber bought
the trousers, says that Adolph came
In at 6:55 and asked for a pair of
trousers. Goldenberg picked out a
pair and handed them to Adolph, who
took them to the back of the store* and
put them on, paying the clerk $2 60 for
them. Adolph then rolled up the old
pair and the clerk took them and tied
them up in a piece of paper and Adolph
left the store with the bundle. The
whole Interview did not last more than
ten minutes.
AUBURN, Nov. 15.â Adolph Weber
appeared for arraignment this after
noon before Judge E. O. Smith. No
action was taken, tho preliminary
hearing: being: continued until to-mor
row on request of the District Attor
ney. *
Young Weber came Into the court
room accompanied by his attorneys,
B. P. Tabor and S. J. Pullen. He was
dressed entirely in black. He was as
cool and' collected as ever. Occasion
ally during: the brief proceedings .a
sarcastic smile would nit across his
countenance. Once when making a
remark to his attorneys his face was
Lighted up with a smile. He took the
keenest interest in the proceedings and
to look at him no one for a moment
could Imagine that he was In any way
connected with the terrible crime with
which' he Is charged.
As soon as the court waa called to
order Judge Smith read the charge
accusing young Adolph with the mur
der of his mother, Mary Weber. A
death-like stillness existed during this
recital, but young Adolph sat with his
features fixed, his countenance immov
able. The accusation that he had
killed his mother had no visible effect
on him.

cil set forth Its attitude as follows:

President GomperÂ» has communicated to the

the central body has neither rectified the wrong

A conference has been arranged to

tional Union of Shipwrights, Joiners

differences. ,
A long account of the controversy
between the Brewery Workers, the
Engineers and the Firemen was given
by the council. The Intensity of the
contention among them did not lessen
any in a year, "notwithstanding the
action and decisions of the conven
tions of the American Federation of
Lobor and despite every effort made
by us to bring about a better state of
affairs."
THE BREWERY WORKERS.
The substance of the recommenda
tions of the council in this matter Is
as follows:
1. That the Indorsement of all firm* d>
rlared unfair by the Brewery Workers which
have been approved by the American Federa
tion of Ltbor be v/ithiirawn.
2. That no application for tho Indorsement of
the Brewery Workers to regard any firm as un
fair shall be entertained, received or Indorsed.
3. That the Indorsement of the American

President Gompers suggested a con
ference between the Amalgamated
Woodworkers' International Union
and the United Brotherhood of Car
penters and Joiners. Some corre
spondence was exchanged. The hold-
Ing of a conference to settle differ
ences was also urged by the council.
Much epace was devoted to a report
by the council relative to the happen
ings connected with the miners in Col
orado and letters written by William
D. Haywood were read. The federa
tion Invited the Western Federation,

has not been effected. Hayward wrote
to Gompers on October 22. 1904, that
"we have, up to the present time,
been unable to get Governor Peabody
or his military henchmen into the
Federal courts." The council de
nounced the actions of officials in Col

that the council included In Its report
is as follows:
It Is perhaps euperfluous for us to say how

FRESNO. Nov. 15.â Because Rev. A.
W. Hare, pastor of the First Congrega
tional Church of this city, said that he
had been informed that $3000 had been
used to colonize the Fifth Supervisor
ial District and purchase Democratic
votes to defeat Judge C P. Walton and
elect W. D. Mitchell to the Board of
Supervisors, the reverend minister was
called to task on the street this morn
ing by Mitchell and a struggle ensued
In which Hare sustained three- broken
ribs.
The fight in the Fifth District for
Supervisor was a warm one. Mitchell
was running on the Republican ticket
and was opposed by Judge C. P. Wal
ton, a Democratic candidate Indorsed
by the Prohibitionists and th* majority
rule factions. The church federation,
composed of the members of the Min
isterial Union, stumped the county for
Walton. Hare. made a somewhat per
sonal campaign against Mitchelf. This,
with his statement last night that cor
rupt methods had been used In Mitch
ell's fight, angered the successful can
didate.
The minister and Mitchell met in
front of the Grand Central Hotel this
morning and Mitchell, when approach
ed by Hare, said: "Our political differ
ences are settled, but not our personal
ones, ' The divine was expecting trou
ble and squared oft for the fray. Mitch
ell struck him a blow in the ribs, fell
ing him to the sldewcflk and then kick

generally thought by the majority of
people that Dyspepsia in its chronic
form is incurable or practically so.
But we have long since shown that
Dyspepsia is curable, nor is it such a
difficult matter as at first appears
The trouble with Dyspeptics - is that
they are continually dieting, starving
themselves, or goir\g to opposite ex-
treme, or else deluging the already
overburdened stomach with "bitters"
â¢after-dinner pills." etc., which inva-
riably increase the difficulty even if
In some cases they do give a slight
temporary relief. Such treatment of
th* stomach simply makes matters
worse. What the stomach wants is
a rest. Now. how can the stomach
become rested, recuperated and at the
yftme time the body nourished and
sustained ?
This is the e.-eat secret and this is
itlso the secret of the uniform success
Â«;! Stuarfs Dyspepsia Tablets. This
is a comparatively n#w remedy but
:!P success and popularity leave no
<1oubt as to its mejiu
The Tablets will digest the food
any way, regardless of condition of
stomach.
The sufferer from Dyspepsia, ac-
cording to directions, is to oat an
abundance of good, wholeso/ne food
and uce the tablets before and after
each meal, and the result will be that
the food Trill be digested; no matter
how bad your Dyspepsia may be be-
cause, a* before stated, the tablets
will digest the food even If the stom-
Â«ch is wholly Inactive.., To Illustrate
Qvr meaning plainly, if you take 1800
eraJns of meat eggs or ordinary
food and place it in. a temperature of
9S degrees, and put with it one of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, it will di-
gest the meat or eggs almost as per-
fectly as if the meat was Inclosed
within the stomach.
The stomach may be ever so weak
yet these tablets will perform the
work of digestion and the body and
brain will be properly nourished, and
at the same time a radical, lasting
cure of Dyspepsia will be made, be-
cause the much abused stomach will
be given, to some extent, a much
needed rest. Your druggist will tell
you that of all the \ many remedies
advertised to cure Dyspepsia none of
them have given so complete and gen^"
eral satisfaction as^ Stuarfs Dyspep-
sia Tablets, and - not least in impor-
tance to these hard times is the fact
that they are also the, cheapest and
Rive the most good for the least
money.

that protection was one of the prin

that he had voted for it, said:
. "It Is hard to discuss the matter at

Representative' #Dalzell, ; the "high

concerned at the White House indi
cations of .in attempt at tariff reform,
and, although he goes no further than
tc say that th?re is no need" for a
change at present, 'It is believed he
will be found lighting any change in
the next two Congresses. He is op
posed to a tariff commission and any
extra session for tariff revision. Rep
resentative HeDburn, one of the ultra
protectionists, of Iowa, talks in a
similar vein. Both insist that the tariff
was an ispue in the recent campaign
and that the people spoke very em
phatically apainst any change.
The situation is not unlike that
which developed at the beginning of
the struggle for Cuban reciprocity
three years ago. President Roosevelt
found himself opposed by every high
tariff man in Senate and House. The
entire House leadership of the Fifty
5ixth Congress came here to fight the
Executive's proposition for reciprocity
with Cuba. One after another they
were won over by the President, but
th< bill died in the Senate. Mr. Roose
velt won his point, however.
The coming struggle, under the
changed conditions which the Presi
dent's tremendous victory has brought
about, is likely to be one of the inter
esting phases of the new administra
tion.

Postmaster General Payne presented
the matter to the President, who gave
orders that Brownlow should be dis
missed from the service. Prior to
Payne's death no action was taken on
the case, and it became an inheritance
of Postmaster General Wynne. When
Wynne took up the subject he induced
the President to consent to allow
Brownlow to continue In the service,
provided he should withdraw his offen
sive statements to the Postmaster Gen
eral. Brownlow's accounts had been
found to be correct and Wynne told
him no reflection had been made on his
Integrity. Despite this assurance, how
ever, Brpwnlow. in a letter to Postmas

draw the statement he previously
made. An order for his' dismissal was
signed to-day.

While Postmaster General Payne was
alive, he wrote Brownlow directing that
he -end to the department a statement
of his receipts and disbursements. In
response Brownlow forwarded the ag
gregate sums of his receipts and dis
bursements. The Postmaster General
then ordered him to submit to the de
partment an itemized sAtement of the
money he had handled. This Brownlow
declined to do, accompanying his re
fusal with statements . to the Postmas

his honor.

He said irrigation and all other in

as irrigation would make the , "West

would cause other sections to prosper
as a result. The' other letter said:
, "I wish it were possible for me to ac

WORD FROM ROOSEVELT.
valuation of property has Increased tenfold
since 1S70 and the population eightfold. This
1Â« a typical example of what irrigation has
dow for portions of California and marks the
possibilities ahead of other communities In our
State.
Fresno Is by no means the most spectacular
example, however. South of Tehachapi a
great civilization has been built upâprosper
ous and cultured, sprung - from the desert-
That beautiful land is one of the show places
of America and the one classic example of
the marvels of irrigation. From this southern
country there were shipped in 1903 over 27.000
carloads of citrus fruits alone. 141 carloads of
wine and brandy and over C000 carloads of
green vegetables. Outside of San Francisco
the bank clearances of Los Angeles exceeded
those of any other city west of the Rocky
Mountains. Here the fullest possibilities of
scientific irrigation have been reached.
What stupendous things may .be expected
when the whole State has" measured up to Its
possibilities in the same way! What would
happen to the territory now embraced In
Glenn and Colusa counties were It developed as
Fresno County or Southern California has been
developed? These counties <once the single
county of Colusa) have over B0O.O<X> acres Im
proved -almost as many acres as has Fresno
County, and the land Is at least as rich as
that of Fresno County. If, Instead of only
40CO acres under Irrigation, these counties had
30C.OCO acre* under irrigation, as In Fresno
County we should expect to see the value of
their products reach $10,CO0,0C0 Instead of the
$5,C00,COO now produced and to see their popu
lation more than three times what It is at
present.
If. instead of measuring the possible pro
gress of thsse two counties by what has been
done In Fresno County, we should take as
the possible llmit^the region about Riverside,
where 10,000 people live upon i:t.O*X> irrigated
acres, we should have over 200,000 people
thriving upon the fertile soil of these two
Sacramento Valley counties.
If Ihe twelve million acres lying In and ad
jacent to the Sacramento and San Joaquin
valleys' which are capable of irrigation had
water upon them we could reasonably expect
a population of six to eight millions instead
of the threa hundred thousand we now have.
We could look for yearly farm products worth
over four hundred millions Instead of the fifty
millions now produced.
At least one-thinl of California's one hun
dred millions of acres can be irrigated. And.
with her snowless winters and her genial sum
mers, these thirty millions of Irrigable acres
ought to have, and will have In the years to
come., a population of at least twenty-five mil.
lions of happy, contented and prosperous
people.

Let us set how this advance in material
propperity coincided with an advance In the
use of irrigation. As might be expected.
Southern California leads. In the percentage of
improved acreage under Irrigation, with the
San Joaquin Valley a clcse second and the
Sacramento Valley a poor third. The number
of Irrigators routh of Tehachapi In 1000 'was
10,254. with 603t for the San Joaqttln Valley
and only 2799 for thÂ» Sacramento -Valley.
What a future for the great Sacramento Val
ley, when her Irrigation possibilities are real
ized; when, instead of less than 5 per cent of
her Improved acreage under Irrigation, she
has nearly 25 per cent, aa In Southern Cali
fornia; .when her' fertile farms will bring In
a profit of over $20 per. acre and the average
farm la reduced from a square mile io tho
fifty-six acres which prevailed In 10CO in the
irrigated districts of thhi State. It is easy to
see that hundreds of thousands would be added
to her population and millions "to her wealth.
ThÂ« communities In California .'that, have
taken ' up Irrigation have become prosperous
beyond all ordinary bounds. The communities
that have neglected their opportunities for
Irrigation have missed a golden harvest. Take
the county of Fresno. In the - middle of thÂ«
San Joaquin Valley, Â« ofcee > practically, an arid
plain. Thirty, years ago the total area onder
cultivation was 21,536 acres- and the- total
value of farm products $299,163. < .The s same
territory.': which now includes lladera as well
as Fresno County. In 1900 had under Irriga
tion Â¦ alone . over .100,000 acres, and â¢ the tatal
value of farm products was nSarly $l0,r,00.0no.

IRRIGATION AND GROWTH.
California stands first among the States -of
the Union In irrigation development. In all
points denoting; progress In irrigation she lÂ«Â»dÂ»,
with the single exception of the number of
acres irrigated, in which she is slightly be
hind Colorado. She has SOCO more irrlgators,
however, than Colorado and the value of h-?r
irricattd crops exceeds Colorado's by. $17,000.
(JXÂ» While the average value of Irrigated
land in the United States is $42 53 per arre. In
California it Is $M> 19. The average value per
acre of irrigated crop3 for th% arid States is
$U 81. In California it Is $2S 47.
And California has just begun. Her Irri
gated acres number about one and one-half
millions of her one hundred millions of total
acreage and the products therefrom are valued
at $!2,00O.CC0. It Is estimated that In the
great valley drained by the Sacramento and
San Joaquin rivers and adjacent thereto, to
say nothing of tho entire southern one-fourth
of the State and many other portions thereof,
there are twelve mtllion acres capable o; Ir
rigation. So there is room yet for progress.
Some portions of California are more alive to
the value of Irrigation than others. South of
Tehachapi. In Southern California, Jm^at'-xi
is prized as the very life-blood of the country.
To the north, the San Joaquin Valley Is cum
ins to depend more and more on irrigation
as the only snjre producer of crops. In the
Sacramento Valley the old regime still holds
sway although the awakening is near at hand.
This lesson Is having Its results, viz: that
those sections of California where irrigation is
most used have had the greatest growth In
wealth and population, and are receiving more
bountifully the good things of life.
In Its natural resources of Siil. climate and
water supply the Sacramento Valley is one of
the most favored places In the United States.
What has been its growth in wealth and popu
lation as compared with the slightly less fa-Â«.
vored' San Joaquin and "with arid Southern
California? In 1*70 the Sacramento Valley had
a pcpul3tion of 101.003,' Its real property valu
ation was $23,313,380, and the value of- its
farm products was over ?16,fi0O,00O. The San
Joaquin Valley had a population Of 45,150. a
real property valuation of S13.736.S22. and the
value of Its farm products was abcut $9,000,
0OO South of Tehachapi the population was
â¢J4.24S. the value cf real. estate $6,500,000 and
th<> value of farm products a little over $1,000,-
Irrigation began, and we have the following
reversal of conditions In 1000: The Sacra
mento Valley has* increased one and one-half
times In population, four and one-half times
in land valuation and a little less than one
and ore-Kalf times In the value of farm prod
uts: the San Joaquin Valley has increawd
three and cne-slxth times in population, eight
times In Ian I valuation and two and one-half
times In the value of form " products. South
ern California has Increased ten and one-sbtth
times in population, twenty times In wealth
and over twelve times In value of farm prod
ucts.
There Is. /perhaps, no other State or Terri
tory Jn the Union whose varied physical char
acteristics so w^ll Ulustrat; what irrigation
can accomplish for the general g-ood as does
my State of California. Her hundred million
of acres extexline from the latitude of
Charleston on the south. 763 miles north to
the latitude of Uoston. embrace within their
limits an extent oÂ£ country which varies in
annual rainfall from zero to sixty and seventy
inches. In these portions of her Sierra Nevada
Mountains where millions of acres of magni
ficent pines clothe their nakedness, and in
those i>ortion3 of her coast range where other
millions of acres of great redwoods tow-er ten
score feet toward heaven, the snow and ralif
fall are am?le to feed the streams running
through the valleys and to furnish Irrigation
water for all tin year. In the great valleys.
tho rainfall varies from twenty inches to four
or five, according to locality. But through
them comes the Sacramento and the San
Joa<ju!n and a half hundred of their tributaries.
tso that these valleys may be irrigated.
The so-called deserts (the eastern parts of
San Bernardino, itiverslde and San Diego
counties, each larger than many of the Suites
cf this Union) netd only water to make them
fruitful almost beyond belief. The Colorado
River, the Nile of the arid West, every drop
of whose water falls u:>on United States soil
and. tnerefore, belongs to the people of the
t.nited States, can be made to brine wealth
and population to these apparently Inhospitable
wastes. Imperial. In San Diego County, flva
years o;o a desert, now has SO0O inhabitants
and those formerly desolate acres now raise
such crops as, astonish even us of California.
Even the MÂ» ave Desert, whose sands drift
hither and yon, the sport of every passing
breeze, needs but the irrigating ditch to make
them support a teeming population.
I heve a notion that this Government could
not spend money to a better . purpose than by
providing irrigation works In such ari4 places
as thoce of the southwestern portions of the
United States. And I confidently look to see
th; day when the national appropriations for
irrigatlcn will go hand In hand with those
for navigation, rivers and harbors, fortifica
tions and the army and navy. While all these
are -necessary. irrigation is also necessary-
And. while they make possible our national
existence and increase our population and
wealth irrigation makes them certain. Con
gress could, in my opinion, do nothing that
would so ourely add to our national prosperity
as would the expenditure of large sums In
lrrisation works. . .O

EL PASO, Tex., Nov. 15. â The
twelfth National Irrigation Congress
was called to order to-day by Senator
W. A. Clark of Montana, its presi
dent. The hall was decorated with
the colors of Mexico and the United
States. The attendance was fully up
to expectations. Music was furnished
by Mexican bands, Including one spe
cially tendered by President Diaz.
The morning session was devoted to
addresses of welcome and responses
thereto. Congressman W. R. Smith
of the Sixteenth Texas District extend
ed a welcome on behalf of the State.
William B. Phillips spoke for the
State University and Captain T. J.
Beall for the city.

the trrny tug Slocurn will take off the
cabin passengers. The vessel will dock
a. little later.
The star passenger en the Thomas
was Major General James F. "Wade.
the former military commander of the
Philippines, who lately "swapped"
commands with General Corbin. Cor
fclu left here recently on a transport
for the Philippines. General Wade
will leave in a few days to take com
xr.and of the Department of the East,
over -which Corbin presided-
Another distinguished passenger on
the Thomas is Dr. Anita Xewcomb
McGce. president o f th e Association
of Spanish-American War Nurses.
Nurse McGee offered her services to
the Japanese Government and for half
s. year has been caring for sick and
T.-our.ded Japanese and Russians In
the Mikado's hospitals and on board
the imperial hospital ships.
ILLUSTRIOUS XAMES.
Among the officers returning on the
Tfcomas are three men bearing famous
raises. They are: First Lieutenant
E'ouglas MacArthur of the Engineer
Corp^, a son of Major General
ilacArthur, commanding the Depart
ment of Ciflifornia; Lieutenant U. S.
Grant, also of the engineers, a grand
son of General and President Grant
and son of the present General Grant,
and Commander E>. H. Mahan of the
r.avy, brother of Captain A. T. Mahan,
the well-known writer on naval sub
jects.
The Thomas has on board 128 cabin
passengers and 463 troops, of whom
twenry-six are general prisoners.
General Wade says that the troops
row in the Philippines are merely on
garrison duty and that the military
government has been, abolished except
::i the iloro district, where there Is a
combination of military and civil gov
ernment. General Wood, who is Mili
tary Governor there, is also Civil Gov
ernor. In the other parts *>f the archi
pelago, says General Wade, the civil
authorities are in full control.
The general does not believe there is
Â«ny danger of any widespread trouble
In the islands, but thinks the natives
Tiill bear a lot of watching. Of in
dustrial conditions in the Islands the
former military commander speaks
without enthusiasm and deplores the
lack of money to build the roads nec
essary to open up the country so that
the most could be made of Its agri
cultural possibilities.
DEVELOPMENT LIMITED.
General Wade considers the* Fili
pino bright to a certain point only and
believes that in the course of time
they may show themselves fit to be
trusted with responsibilities. They are
apt to abuse authority an5 their de
velopment seems possible only to a
certain p^int.

Uricsol,
the only cure for
Rheumatism.
If you rre suffering from rheuma-
tism there is a chance for you to be-
come absolutely cured. You may
cure j-ourse'f and do it quickly if you
v.-iii lay aside your prejudice and
skepticism.
Every San Francisco druggist sells
Uricsol, the well-known remedy, and
we hereby authorize them to guaran-
tee a cure.
Un^sol cures rheumatism in the only
possible vray it can be cured.
Uric Acid and Uratess are the cause
of Rheumatism. These are deposited
ir. the tissues, blood vessels and joints
of the body.
These deposits must be dissolved
and eliminated from the system be-
fore a cure can be accomplished.
Uricsol is a solvent of these and
tones up the system, stimulates the I
kidneys, liver ~nd bowel;, and thus !
drives them from the system.
Uricsol is harmless, and no injuri-
ous results can possibly, come to any
part of your body.
Write us to-day for booklet con-
taining recommended diet for rhea-
tratics.

MILLIONS TO BE SPENT
ON HARRIMAN LINES
BERLIN, Not. 15. â Emperor Wil
liam's extensive canal projects, re
jected by the Prussian Diet in 1898
and 1901, are to be realized in part
at least. The canal committee of the
Diet, composed of the leaders of the
parties controlling the Diet, has de
cided to support the measures for a
canal connecting Hanover with the
Rhine and for using the Weser for a
canal from Hamlen downward, pro
vided Bremen will stand part of the
expense. Tho .canal will use about
sixty miles of the existing Dortmund
Ems canal and will have two outlets
into the Rhine, one from the present
terminus of the Dortmund Ems canal
to Ruhrort and the second down the
valley of the Llppe to the Weser. The
use of Lippe River for a canal will
also be carried upward to Hamm. The
total length, exclusive of the Weser.
will be 165 miles. The cost will be
about $5,000,000. The vote on the
Berlin-Stettin canal and other projects,
was postponed. "Â¦
The committee's action is regarded
as Insuring the passage of the meas
ure through the Diet in Its present
form. The bill embraces a center
party amendment, giving the Prussian
Government a monopoly of propulsion
in the canal by tug or electrical mo
tors running along the shore. It ap
pears that this amendment was the
only thing which saved the bill, since
it genders the measure acceptable to
the part of the Agrarian element that
Hopes to compel the Government to
keep freight rates high enough to
compete seriously with railroads and
thereby prevent the cheap transpor
tation of agricultural . products and a
consequent encroachment of foreign
grain from the German market.
Baron von Zedlltz, who was the
leading spirit of the opposition to the
canal bills in 1899 and 1901, Is now
trying to persuade the conservatives
to support the present measure in or
der to. close the breach between them
and the Emperor caused by the re
jection of those bills.

usual the Greek Theater would have
been used /ind Ben Greet's company of

sonorous voices, this time in "The Star

Captain Nance is now preparing a
report to the university authorities.
It is believed that, in accordance with,
his attitude taken at the beginning of
the affair and maintained since, he
will recommend the dropping from
his class of nearly all the sixty-three
students who failed to give him satis
factory explanation of their conduct.
Captain Nance said to-day: "I have
nothing to say now about the matter,
but when all is settled the the news
papers will get the story In official
shape."
Captain Nance said: "Give me the
names of the men who prevented
you." The men regarded this as an
attempt to make them "peach" on
their comrades and refused.
The men made answer yesterday
in person to the charges preferred
against them by Captain Nance.
Nearly all said they were prevented
obeying the order of Captain. Nance
by those who composed the mob of
riotous students on the campus on
that famous day.

HULL. Nov. 15.â The inquiry which
Great Britain conducts on her behalf
into the North Sea affair opened to

liritish rase before the international

This might explain, but. in the British
view, does not justify, the attack upon

There was nothing in the evidence to
bear out the Russian claim that the
Baltic fleet was attacked by torpedo

There was a, marked falling off in
the demand for Japanese bonds at
the Nevada Bank yesterday. The
amount subscribed during the day was
$202,400. The sum secured Monday
was $919,100. The total loan for
which application has been made in
San Francisco is $1,121,500.
The people who subscribed yester
day numbered 107 and all of these
loans were for comparatively small
amounts. It Is expected that the en
tire $60,000,000 which the Japanese
Government wishes to borrow will be
slightly oversubscribed, as the bonds
are offered in London and New York
as well as In this city. The first loan
proved more popular, although it was
sought on less advantageous terms.
President Hellman of the Nevada
Bank says : that he thinks San Fran
cisco has done very well in subscribing
for more than a million dollars* worth
of the securities in two days. It Is
believed that the requisite amount will
have been secured by the end of to
day, an intimation to that -ffect
having reached here last night.

The Russians have been considerate
in their treatment of the dead Jap
anese warriors. This recognition by
both sides of the benevolent care of
the dead still further marks the aban

This humane practice, which was
initiated by the Japanese and which
apparently was calculated to secure
consideration for their dead, has "met
with applause from the Russian army
and undoubtedly will be imitated
whenever the Russians are in posses

BRITISH NORTH SEA INQUIRY.
LONDON, Nov. 16.â The Dally Tele
graph's correspondent with the Jap
anese army before Port Arthur, de
scribing the attack of the Japanese on
the eastern fortified ridges on October
30, rays:
"The terrific and continuous bom
bardment, night and day, from October
?" to October SO, culminated In a won
<5erful artillery practice, quite beyond
description. With appalling rapidity
countless bursting shells mingled their
smoke into a dense, oscillating mass of
vapor, laden with earth and gleaming
with flashes of fire, the climax being
reached at 1 o'clock with a tremendous
fire of shrapnel across the broken
breastworks of the fortresses.
"Suddenly every gun ceased firing
and the Japanese infantry rushed out
from their parallels before the hills had
ceased reverberating with the thunder
of the cannonade from seven separate
quarters against the Rihlung, Keekwan
and Panlung fortified ridges. The at
tack was simultaneously developed
without a single premonitory feint,
fully 4000 troops dashing out pellmell
â¢.vith fixed bayonets, waving standards
and rending the air with shouts of
iianrai!' "
The correspondent details how the
various Japanese attacks were checked
by the big moats and the terrible Rus
sian fire, which rapidly depleted their
ranks, notwithstanding a clever cover
ing fire of Japanese artillery, and ,
ea ys : ;
"It -was moit remarkable, even in- I
credible, but fully substantiating the |
eunr.ises of their ability to withstand i
the fire of the heaviest Japanese ord- â¢
iiar.ee. how the Russians, despite the
previous bombardment, replied from
their fortress guns, although over 1S00
500-pound shells had been fired that
day. not counting thousands of smaller
projectiles. Before half an hour had
elapsed and after losing 600 men, the
Japanese abandoned the attack against
the south Keekwan fort.
"By 4 o'clock the Japanese fire dimin
ished in intensity and the assaults
ceased shortly before sunset, when fire'
broke out Sn the new town of Port Ar
thur; and at nightfall the Japanese
opened a shranr.el fire on the eastern
rfdge to cover the retirement cf their
isolated assaulters, whose situation
was critical between the east and the
pouth Keekwan forts. The total Jap
anese casualties exceeded 2000.
"Although the assaults failed in the
capture of the main objective they ab
solutely unmasked the eastern Russian
positions ar.d their strength. The cas
ualties are relatively small, for al
though seven regimtnts were engaged,
not half the troops issued from the
parallels, owing to the attacks being so
Fkillfully manipulated and finally ceas
ing. For strength the Russian propo-
Fition was unassaultable, and it would
have been useless to endanger double
the force and incur double the casual
ty in the same assault.
"Aftef dusk the Russians sortied and
recovered the ground lost between the
south and the east Keekwan forts.
They recovered the fort at 10 o'clock in
the evening, but General Ichinoye gal
lantly restormed the hill and. despite
250 casualties, expelled the Russians by
sheer dash and courage. Indeed, his
Personality won the hill for the Jap
anese.
"After having captured the capon
ieres (covered galleries) of the East
Keekwan forts, the Japanese engaged
in a bloody fight in the underground
passage, slowly winning the vitals of
the forts inch by inch, despite the
bombs and mountain guns of the Rus
sians defending the casemates. On
November 6 the central and fort sec
tions of the caponieres were gained.
The work, however, is progressing
tlowly, owing to the nature of the
ground."
The Daily Telegraph's Chetu corre
sponder^ g'ves rumors of renewed
Japanese attacks on Port Arthur with
15.000 troops between .November 2 and
â¬. with 1200 casualties. The Daily Tel
egraph, however, does not credit these
rumors, because of evidence that the
foregoing dispatch was filed on Novem
ber 6 or later. November 6 still re
rr.ains the latest dat^ of reliable news
from Port Arthur. -

AWFUL COST OF ASSAULT.
HUMANITY ON BATTLEFIELD.
CHAXSIANTUN, Manchuria, Gen
eral Kuropatkin's Headquarters, Nov.
IT.. â A Japanese advance is daily ex- |
pected. Large masses of their troops
are moving eastward and the Russians
are expecting them to strike at their
left flank.
An attack upon the fortified village
of Endowuniulu, not far from Sinchin- j
pu. two miles west of the Shakhe Rail- '
road station, and fronting the right 'Â¦
flank of the Seventeenth Corps, was
carried out brilliantly during the night
of November 10 by the Second Brigade
of the Thirty-flfth Infantry division.
The village had been captured the
same morning by the Japanese. Sub
sequently the Russians abandoned the
place.
At nightfall the brigade silently
marched out and deployed. Four bat
talions were detached for the attack
and several companies of riflemen were
ordered to move from the right, left
and rear of the village. The men were
told not to fire, but to charge with the
bayonet. Two battalions were left in
reserve with eight guns.
A simultaneous advance was begun at*
10 o'clock at night. The assailants hur
ried forward and encountered a deep
ravine, which they crossed. They then
rushed on the village. Not a shot was
fired. The Japanese were completely
surprised, while sitting in the streets
and huts, eating their suppers. They
lied before the bayonets.
As soon as the Russians occupied the
village they brought up a battery. The
Japanese tried to recapture the place at
break of day, but were repulsed. The
Russians, however, were compelled
later to abandon Endowuniulu as the
retirement of the third division ex
posed them to a flank attack.

"Nan's" trial was to-day postponed
until to-morrow. She looked healthy
and appeared graceful and easy in
court to-day.
NEW YORK, Nov. 15.â Snapshot
photographs of J. Â¦ Morgan Smith will
be introduced in evidence at the trial
of "Nan" Randolph Patterson, his sis
ter-in-law, for the murder of "Caesar"
Young, which will begin in the crimi
nal branch of the Supreme Court to
morrow morning to determine whether
he is the man who bought the revolver
with which the bookmaker was killed.
Assistant District Attorney Rand, who
will represent the people at the trial,
regards the identity of the purchaser
of the revolver as one of the most vital
points in the case. If he . can prove
that it was bought by "Nan" Patter
son, or by any relative or close friend
of the accused, his chain of circum
stantial evidence will be complete.
Stern, the pawnbroker* who sold a
revolver to a man accompanied by a
younar woman on the morning before
Young was killed, says he can identify
both if they are brought before him.
He has already declared that "Nan"
Patterson was not the woman.
He was taken to the District Attor
ney's office shortly before "Nan" Pat
terson was indicted for murder , and
there saw J. Morgan Smith. Smith
was Immediately subpenaed to appear
before the Orand Jury, but the .next
day he disappeared and the prosecution
has not been able to locate him.
Confronted by this obstacle, Rand to
day executed a flank movement on the
defense. Messengers from the District
Attorney's office were sent scurrying
about town, looking for recent photo
graphs, preferably snapshots, of J.
Morgan Smith. It is understood that
several excellent likenesses were se
cured.

S~^\ HANGES are proposed in game and fish laws that will appear
I . to the people as a monopoly in the interest of professional
Â»^"^ sportsmen. It is proposed to make the sale of any game
illegal, but to permit its killing. True, the bag is restricted more
than under the present law, but it is exclusive and the public is
shut out.' We think a far wiser measure and more agreeable to
public sentiment would be a law prohibiting all killing of game and
taking of trout for a term of years, treating everybody alike. If
this closed term be for five years, the conditions at its end would fix
the limitations upon the taking of game. Such a season of uninter
rupted increase of game would greatly increase our game birds and
animals, and give the gun and gunners a rest.
We know of no way in which a law permitting killing of game,
and denying its enjoyment to the general public, can be made to
seem right or be made popular. Preserves and exclusive privileges
are detested in every country where they exist. No doubt something
is to be said in their favor by those who propose the change, and
they should make themselves heard, if they have aught to say that
will bring to their aid the public opinion which will be found neces
sary to pass the law they propose.
It is believed that under the present law much slaughtered
game is spoiled unused. When a hunter kills three deer, as he is now
permitted to do, part of the venison may spoil. If he were per
mitted to expose and sell it in the market it would be saved and
consumed by those who desire that food and are now denied the
right to buy it. This would not be pot hunting, and use of the meat
would not increase the slaughter. We believe the people think the
present law is sufficiently exclusive, and that if there is to be any
change it should be to close the season for five years.
GAME AND FISH LAWS.

THE SUNNY SIDE OF LIFE
THE State Board of Health of Kentucky has passed a rule put
ting the plush seat of railroad cars under the ban because of
its possibilities as a nncrobe breeder. Another Eastern author
ity has attempted to condemn the public telephone as a fruitful
nesting place for disease germs. Barbers advertise antiseptic
shaves, haberdashers sell medicated hat bands, grocers advocate
germless breakfast foods. Is the world growing germ mad?
Not long ago Professor Alfred Rosenbach, a noted Berlin
scientist, published a book, "Physician Versus Bacteriologist," in
which he declared that if the bacteria mania is allowed to con
tinue its full sway the whole social order of things will be radically
changed, and for the worse. As it is, all of our sympathies for the
afflicted are put to rout at the first cry of contagion. Every one of
our instincts of brotherly or fatherly affection is blunted by the
fear of the ever-present bacillus. Those supposed to be thejJis
seminators of harmful disease germs are shunned as pariahs, despite
all bonds of family affection or social ties. Fear of infection is- un
dermining the whole fabric of social intercourse according to the
view of this German doctor. WxZ /
Recently a high French official from one of the islands of
Oceanica was turned back from this port because he was supposed
to be suffering from consumption, and- it was held by the Govern
ment officials that his passage across the continent would be a
menace to the lives of the people of the United States. Again, one
of the railroads of the West has provided special cars for suf
ferers from this malady and in these they must ride or not ride at
all. These two circumstances' alone instance the length to which
the microbe mania has warped human judgment and weakened
human sympathies. It is to be hoped that the inevitable reaction
that must follow this far swing of the pendulum will not be long
deferred.
THE MICROBE MANIA.
MIRROR OF DAME FASHION.
For the first few days Ryland was
thoroughly interested in the novel
v/ork and was there when Â« school
opened and remained until it closed,
and by the time the novelty began to
You will design the schoolhouse â of
logs, you knowâ select the books and
make out a list of the apparatus neces
sary."
"But hold on," began MI6S Collin
wood, the merriment in her face
changing to sudden dismay.
"No, no," hurriedly, "it is absolutely
necessary. It is theâ the examination,
you know â er, to take the place of it,
I mean. I have felt worried about the
school books, for, I never went to an
American~School, you know. . I couldn't
refuse, of course, for they -are all splen
did, hardworking people here, and it
would help~them! I thinkjve will make
a great success of it now."
"I hope so," faintly.
He looked at her keenly.
'Of course, I shall help you all I
can," he reassured her. "The first few
days I expect I had better even help
with the teaching. Some of the young
people can speak broken English and
some cannot speak English at all, and
most of them are only half civilized.
But I've been here several years and
understand them and they-all like me.
I think if I go to school with you a
while and tell them hunting 'stories,"
and perhaps take one of my half-wild
horses there for them to give exhibi
tions on and try to break It during
recess it might keep them more tract
able. But suppose we go over to the
Rikshons' now and arrange for your
accommodation."
One week later school commenced
on log benches and a desk under the
trees. Ryland_was there with an in
exhaustible store of hunting and ani
mal stories to bribe the scholars' at
tention and with a vicious .horse
fastened to one of the trees, which
was to be common out of
school hours.
IT is to be hoped that the State Grange will not permit the sub
ject of tax reform to lie dormant during the coming .session of
the Legislature. The people at the late election adopted the
amendment to the constitution which exempts about $40,000,000 of
personalty from taxation. As the exempted tax will fall upon
assessable property, it is highly necessary that a reformed system
shall properly distribute the existing and the added burden.
The proposition to raise the State tax entirely from corporations
and State licenses, exempting them from local taxation, and ex
empting realty and personalty from State taxation, has the merit of
being long past the experimental stage. In many of the larger and
older Eastern States it has been long in practice, and the results
have so justified it that neither corporations, State licensees nor
individual owners of personalty and realty would think of aban
doning it. It takes an afflicting friction out of local politics. ; It
saves the expense of the annual equalization of valuation and levy
between the counties, and puts an end to the annual, and often un
just, arraignment of the Board of Equalization.
That board has to enforce a valuation that will raise the
money required by the fixed expenses of the State and the extra
appropriations made by the Legislature. In doing this it must deal
with corporate valuations and county assessments. Naturally, the
counties want as much tax as possible put upon corporations, and
these want as much as possible put upon the counties. This
causes annual crimination and charges against the board of favor
ing corporations at the expense of the people. Under the system
proposed by the State Grange the amount of money to be raised
for support of the State government being known, the Board of
Equalization will have to deal with corporations and State licensees
only, much to its relief and to the ending of a great deal of friction.
" Such a change will put local expenditure of public money, and
local taxation to support it, on such a basis that expenditures will
be more economically made and better guarded. The corporations
and State licensees can be relied upon to do all the watching neces
sary to secure economy in the State government. Governor Pardec
has* more than once given out his opinion that this change should
be made, and it is not unlikely that he will deal with it in his an
nual message. It is purely a question of scientific taxation. No
one has any ax to grind in the matter. In Professor Plehn, of the
State University, the Legislature will find an expert on the whole
subject of taxation, whose statements of fact and conclusions of
science can be relied upon. This is a great public question. If the
coming session devote its whole time to it, and. produce a solution
in line with experience, productive of public economy and con
clusive of the friction that affects politics unfavorably to its morals,
it -will be amply justified.
The State is no longer a pioneer commonwealth. Its primitive
conditions are long past. Its wealth of all kinds is rapidly in
creasing. Its simple forms of property have been' replaced by
complexity. The duties of the Assessor are increased by the
multiplication of industries and the development of resources.
The garments that fitted its frontier conditions are a misfit now,
and should be cast off for those of ampler cut. All of these consid
erations have appealed to the State, Grange, representing the rural
population, and it has entered upon a reform campaign in a most
temperate and reasonable manner. The Legislature cannot afford
to ignore its appeal. Nor, do we believe, can the cities of the
State avoid" manifesting their interest in the subject. They have
every reason for supporting the grange in the discussion.
In the next Legislature are many strong men. It promises to
develop talent for the full discussion and proper conclusion of such
an issue as this. The knowledge that such a subject is" to come be
fore it will influence favorably the election of Speaker of the House
and the appointment of committees in both branches. .When
there* is nothing ahead for a session but small and routine matters
the organization is made according to their measure. But when
great matters like this one are in sight the measure of the organ
ization is controlled bv them.

They talked for half an hour longer,
making plans and discussing hopes;
then he noticed the bulk of unopened
letters in his pocket. He, took them
out. one by one, and read them, still
talking, and making comments on
what they contained. The last was
from the same solicitor as the first,
written two days later, but mailed in
time to reach the' same boat It read:
"The late Baronet's injuries, at first
thought slight, developed alarming
symptoms yesterday, and he died this
morning^ You succeed to the title.
Please come, at once."
She was Just closing the door when
he arrived, and something in her eyes
as she greeted him changed his in
tended brief farewell Into: "Suppose
we stop under the trees a little while.
Miss Collinwood. It is so pleasant
here now; and besides, I have some
thing I want to tell you."
"Under the trees" had been their
favorite talking place, and he found it
even more. difficult to speak the words
of farewell . there than he had at the
schoolhouse door. Several times he
forced them to his lips, but looking
into her eyes and listening â¢ to her
voice he could not give them utter
ance. England and the three thou
sand pittance were slipping farther
and farther away, and America and
this girl beside him were becoming,
nearer and more indispensable. She
was telling him of some of her am
bitions and hopes, and the indomit
able courage was firing his own veins
and making simple what had before
seemed insurmountable. He had
thought this girl his dearest friend;
he now knew that she was infinitely
more, and in this land, or anywhere,
it would be easy to make a living for
the woman he loved. Suddenly he
reached out and took her hands in
his, strongly, and she did not resist.
"Miss Collinwood â Elinor." he said
steadily, "will you marry me?"
And she. after a moment of silence,
but not hesitation, answered quietly,
"Yes."
It was this that took him straight
to the schoolhouse. Miss Collinwood
was more to him than all else in
America, how much more he had not
realized until he decided to leave.
pall he had become even more thor
oughly Interested in the teacher.
Among Â¦ his letters from England
two months or so later was one from
the family solicitors/ the opening
paragraph of which read: "It is our
painful duty to inform you of a tead
accident which befell your Cousin
Robert and the Baronet while testing
a new automobile. Robert was In
stantly killed and the* Baronet some
what injured. He is already better,
thanks to his rSbust constitution. This
makes you the heir and the^Baronet
directs that you dispose of any inter
ests you may have in America and
return home immediately. Robert's
allowance of Â£3000 a year will be
yours if you reside in England. We
may add that the Lady Ellen is stay-
Ing at the hall."
Ryland read the letter thoughtfully,
but on the whole with clearing face.
Only that morning he had received
an intimation that a, mortgage would
b<Â» foreclosed on his ranch unless the
interest be paid 'Immediately. That
would leave him practically penniless.
His natural bent was for quiet and
his books. He doubted if he could
make a living in America, or any
where for that matter. The only thing
was to return and accept the Â£3000,
and, incidentally, Lady Ellen.
Once decided, he thrust the rest of
the letters into his pocket and started
out to say good-by to his friends.
When something disagreeable was in
prospect the less" procrastination the
better.
The six dugouts and store in sight,
and a few more isolated dugouts be
low the horiaon, comprised Cattleborro,
dignified with a tri- weekly mail and
having Ryland, as the most literary
man of the community, and the recipi
ent of the bulk of the mail, its custo
dian.
As the wagon drew near he saw that
it contained a second occupant, and
presently that the second occupant was
; a woman. Then the wagon drew up
in front of the dugout and the woman
descended, disclosing herself to be
scarcely more than a girl, and such
a girl as Cattleboro had never seen
before. Ryland made a quick step
forward, the pleasure on his face min
gled with a good deal of wonder.
"Where can I find a hotel, sir? Is the
schoolhouse near? Will you be kind
enough to direct me to Mr. Ryland's?"
the girl asked, almost in a breath.
Ryland's wonder became sudden com
prehension.
"You are Â« Miss Collinwood?" he
"Well, suppose you step into the dug
out a moment I will get the mail and
then come in and explain. I am Mr.
Ryland."
, Outside the dugout was like the
others of the country; within the simi
larity faded. Skins and Indian blank
ets concealed the rough walls, and
there was a profusion of books and
periodicals. The girl's eyes flashed a
friendly recognition toward some of
the titles; then Ryland entered with a
little package of letters and papers
in his hand and with a troubled look
on his face.
"I'm sorry you didn't wait for me
to write again," he said. "The fact is
we haven't any schoolhouse yet. The
boys are busy rounding up and brand
ing their cattle Just now and so it's
been put off. And â er, there isn't a
hotel or boarding-house in the whole
country. The only thing I see is for
you to go to the Rikshons' dugout,
only a auarter of a mile from here.
I think they will be able to squeeze a
room for you; and they're good peo
ple, though Mrs. Rikshon cannot speak
a word of English. My idea was for
you to board with Stanley, but 'his
wife is East Just now and thev won't
move into their dugout under a month.
Why didn't you wait until I had some
thing definite to write?" pathetically.
The girl laughed.
"I suppose it was because I liked
your letter describing the country," she
replied. "I wanted to take a vacation,
and it occurred to me this would be
just the place. I could see the people
and get some Idea of what school du
ties are. You see, this is to be my first
attempt at teaching. As to the Rik
shons, I think we will get along very
nicely together.",
Ryland's face showed his relief.
"Then it will be all right," he de
clared. "I'll corralâ call the men to
gether, and we'll put up a log school
house for you just as soon as their rush
work is over. We've already selected
a fine clump of trees to build under.
And in the meantime, if you wish, we
can arrange for you to teach the chil
dren out of doors, under the trees.
There will be no rains at this season."
"That will be delightful," she cried,
eagerly; "only," her face falling a lit
tle, "I haven't secured the position
"I give it to you now."
"Without examination?"
He looked embarrassed; then
laughed.
"Why, yes, I think I'd better. I don't
__ IXAND, younger son and only

fences and over his few scat

object which had brought him to the
door â the mall wagon.

A London jeweler has made a collec
tion of ancient forks used in England,
which show some little known facts
about the table manners of a few cen
turies ago. The forkB, which are of solid
silver, date from the sixteenth century.
In many cases the designs in all this
time have scarcely varied in any detail
and the forks look like those which
might be bought to-day. The old forks
were a great luxury In their time and
werÂ» only used by the aristocracy.

My mother takes me in her bed
When I'm afraid at night.
And holds me in her nice, safe arms
All warm and snug and tt*ht;
And says there's not a single thing
For little boys to fear,
In day or night, because there's God
Who's always very near.
I know he is â¢ â¢ â¢ .but then, somehow
When It's so dark. . I do
Just love to hold my mother's hand,

A circular letter will be issued to
obtain opinions regarding the re-ceding
cf Tcsemite Park and the Maripoaa
big tree grove to the United States
Government. The board is practically
on record as favoring this step, but
wishes the opinions of others before
taking final auction.
Colonel John P. Irish offered what ha
th<r,\n rr.Â»y be a solution of the prob
lem. - He said he had observed that the
farmers ia California would harvest
their crops with a header which nip
ped off the portion of the wheat bear
ing kernels and left the straw In the
ground. The heads would then at ence^
be sent to the machine, threshed cut
and sacked. In the Eastern. States.
Tv-here the kernels have a larger pro
portion cf gluten, the crop is cut from
the ground with a reaper, bound, stack
ed and allowed to season before bein^
threshed out. In order to test his
theory he says he has made arrange
ments with a person who will cut half
his croD with a header and send it at
ence to be threshed out and will use
a harvester oa the other half. The
ground Is identical and all conditions,
aside from the reaping and sacking,
will be ec.ua!
William H. lHHs told cf his experi
ence in harvesting hay. Ha said that
he had noticed when the hay was left
in ths field it would bleach out. but
where it was stacked ui> after drying
out a moist wind would cause It to
become green again. H* thought the
theory of Colonel Irish worthy of trial
and agreed with fti-p that the kernels,
under certain climatic conditions,
might draw additional sustenance from
the 3traÂ«rs after cutting.
Oa motion of ilr. Mills Andrew P.
Hill cf Saa Jos<3TVaa appointed cfll
cial photographer for tfie board. He
called attention to the fact that ths
majority of photographs of California
distributed through the East are made
at the instance of th* railroad com
panies to attract tourist traffic and ac
cordingly show only the scenic fea
tures. The industrial end, he said,
was of far greater Importance, but
had never been fully illustrated. Mr.
Hill promises to take a number of pho
tographs illustrating farm and homÂ«
life in the State.
A communication will be circulated

and advantage to certain localities and

ence and disadvantage to ethers; al3O
to Drovide effectual means of protec

General N. P. Chipman made a
lengthy report regarding the exhibits

At the meeting cf the State Board of
Trade yesterday afternoon the subject
cf improving the quality cf California
wheat was brousht up. This matter
h^g beea discussed by a committee
from the State Board and representa
tives of the Merchants' Exchange. Cal
ifornia wheat, it has beea found, is

Ia their contest they say that their
father for tea years* had beea physi
cally Â«n>j mentally weak and depended
childishly oa hi3 wife's Judgment. For
that period, they say, he was prac
tically a prisoner in her hands and she
refused to allow him to- see his frtanda
and relatives except on rare occasions,
and then always In her presence. They
say that she Interfered with their
business, and domestic affairs and

"Whether Frank J. Horn, who died

question to \ be settled ia the contest

The testament seems to bear out th.9
widow's statement. Horn said there
in that ha had his children in mind,
bat could only leave them his bleaa
ing3, because he owned nothing but
Jewelry, which he wanted his wife to
have. He said that when he married

was then Secretary, of tha Territory.
The bond3, which. bÂ«ar 4^i per cent In
terest, were ta&en. by New Tori finan
ciers at 100^25. This good figure was
obtained largely owtns to the ordar
made by Secretary Shaw rscogidzlns

public money in. national bank3 tip to
SO per cent cf their par value.
Governor Carter has received an. in
timation, that the Secretary cf the
Treasury Is disinclined to grant a simi
lar favor in the case of the second mil
lion.
Without the renewal cf the prtvCeys
Governor Carter Is afraid the second

Treasury's official countenance for the
second installment of the Territorial
loan. The- first 11,000^000 ha3 been almost

men who managed the big football
game between the Stanford and Cali

â¢ccunted their cash returns last night
they found the total amount realized

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 15. â Oakland
opened here to-day in a series of Bix
games that probably will determine
the winner of the second half of the
season's championship. Oakland won
by the score of 6 to 1, because of
Jones' magnificent work In the box.
Newton started in to pitch for the
Angels, but was in bad foxm and gave
way to Baum after six runs had been
scored. Baum pitched a remarkable
game, only two hits being made off
his delivery In seven innings. Both
teams were on edge and some bril
liant work was done by the infields.

In making the club's new home one of
the handsomest In this city. After
the members had been . welcomed and
given an opportunity to inspect the
premises President George J. Brad
ley called them together in the re
ception-room, and addressed them
upon th'e great progress made by the
organization during its few months'
existence and proudly announced that
notwithstanding the heavy expense
thajU'had been Incur*xÂ»d it was free
from debt and enjoyed a rapidly ln
Â¦creasingf membership roll.
At the conclusion of President
Bradley's remarks the members spent
several hours enjoying the entertain
ment provided for them by talented
members of the club. Refreshments

Mohler Lets Lynch Score on an Error
in Second Round.
FRESNO. Nov. 15. â Great ball was
played to-day. While brilliant plays
were scarce, the work of both teams
was uncommonly good. The feature
of the game was the steady pitching
of Keefe and Hogg. Nordyke was in
disposed and Lynch played his posi
tion in great shape. Tacoma won, 1
to 0. The lone score was made in the
second inning. Lynch got a scratch hit
and was advanced to third on Casey's
hit. He scored on Mohler's error.

Sidney Dillon, sire of Lou Dillon,
the first trotter to reach the two
minute mark, left Santa Rosa Satur
day afternoon by the Southern Pa
cific for Xew York, where he will go
under the hammer at the Old Glory
sale in Madison-square Garden on
the 21st inst. At the same sale Arion
(2:07%), whose two-year-old record
of 2:10% to high wheels has never
been equaled by any other two-year
old even with the aid of a pneumatic
sulky and a wind shield, will also be
offered. There Is much speculation
as to which stallion will bring the
most money. Arion was sold by his
breeder, Senator Stanford, to the late
Malcolm Forbes for 1125,000. This
is the highest price ever paid for a
trotting bred horse, but that waa in
boom davs, and he cannot be expected
to bring more than a fifth of that sum
now. The sale will be a noted one,
as sixteen highly bred and well
known stallions have been consigned
to it, among them Idolita (2:09 U).
Directly (2:03^), Delmarch (2:11%),
Jupe (2:07^) and others. Directly is
a pacer and holds a champion record.
In 185)4 he paced a mile in 2:07% as
a two-vear-old, a mark that has not
been beaten since. He knocked a
quarter second oft! that record as a
three-year-old, but was on the shelf
for three years and was reckoned a
cripple until George West took charge
of him and reduced his mark to
2:03 Vi in a race.
EXHIBITION BY SWEET MARIE.
Lovers of the harness horse lit Los
Angeles are waiting for Thanksgiving
day to give the champion mare Sweet
Marie (2:04^4) a grand reception.
The Driving Club of that city will hold
an afternoon of matinee racing on
that day, and William Garland,
owner of the mare, has promised to
drive her an exhibition mile. She
reached home in the pink of condi
tion and does not bear the faded out
appearance that most campaigners
have at the close of the season. Her
rugged strength and vitality are re
markable.
Monroe Salisbury, th$ "king maker,"
reached home some days since from his
successful campaign with the East View
Farm Stable on the Grand Circuit. It
was the largest money winning stable
out this year, wfth, close to $50,000 to
its credit. Charles' de Ryder, the
farm's principal reinsman, stood sec
ond only to Ed Geers in the list of
money winning drivers. Geers drove
for many different owners, j Â¦
Â¦ Since McKinney left California there
has been considerable rivalry among
horsemen as to which owns the best
bred son of that horse. C. A. Durfee.
who owned the stallion, thinks he has
the ( heir apparent to nis throne In a
tve-year-oid by McKinney. dam the
great brood mare Elsie, dam by Palita,
two-year-old record 2:16, and four
others, st-cond dam Elaine(2:20),dam of
Iran Alto (2:12%) and three more, third
dam Green Mountain Maid, dam of
nine trotters with standard records and
also of the great Electioneer. The colt
is Â«jn*r of the handsomest two-year-olds
McKinney ever sired.
BIG MOXEY WINNERS.
Eleven trainers have won more than
Ndlson is 'practically in condition for
the fight at the present time. He weighs
about 134 pounds and can take off the
few extra ones in short order. He 13
doing the best he can in the condition
line over at Larkspur and it goes with
out saying he will be in perfect form
when the time rolls round.
"If Nelson wins," said Coffroth, "he
would pot make such a good drawing
card as Corbett for the simple reason
that his victory would in all probability
be a long drawn out one and the spec
tacular end of it would be lacking. On
the other hand, should Corbett knock
his man out in a decisive manner, he
would show the knowing ones he is still
there and then a second meeting with
Britt would prove a battle of the first
water."
Coffroth would also like to see Jimmy
Gardner in the ring with Britt, but so
far he has been unable to get any kind
of a satisfactory line on the Lowell
wonder. It looks as though Coffroth
will hold out till after the Corbett-Nel
son mixup and take a chance with
matching the victor against Brltt. The
victor will in all probability be badly
punishedâ nearly as much so as the
vanquished, and therefore may not be
quite fit to enter the ring witnin a
couple of weeks.
Corbett is faithfully ridding himself
of several pounds of superfluous flesh at
his training quarters. He â¢vfceighs 137
pounds and, still looks like a miniature
heavyweight. ' He is doing more real
hard work for this 'fight than he has
performed for any other encounter In
this city. If he keeps up the pace he
should enter the. ring on the 29th fit
and ready for the best man of his
weight In the world.
Teddy, Murphy, manager of Nelson,
announces that he will have a goodly
wager down on his man when he
clashes with the Denverite. Murphy fig
ures that the betting will be about 10 to
7, and says he will place a couple of
thousand of his own coin on the Nor
wegian. He also expects to act as a
betting commissioner for several well
known Eastern sporting men who like
Nelson's chances. A few wagers have
been made at odds of 10 to 7 in Cor
bett's favor. Â¦ â¢
The fight fans are still waiting for
the Yosemite Club to discover some
likely young man worthy of a set-to
with J. Edward Britt for the December
date of the club. Manager James Cof
froth finds the role of a discoverer a
difficult one to play. Light and feather
weight pugilists who have the reputa
tion of giving the public a run for Its
money do not lurk in every ' hamlet,
so it can readily be seen Mr. Coffroth
will be forced to resort to some allur
ing bait in order to capture the lad who
will make the fighting Brltt extend
himself.
The winner of the Corbett-Nelson
bout still looks rather good to Coftroth.
He would like to see Corbett triumph
over the battling marvel from Illinois,
for he figures that if Corbett can win
decisively the latter will again be re
stored to the good graces of the San
Francisco public and, with added con
fidence, would give Mr. Britt a good
time for a fair portion of twenty rounds
at least.
Alex Greggains announces he will
turn forth several new boys at his
regular monthly boxing show at
Woodward's Pavilion on Friday night.
Here is the card: George Peterson
(champion) vs. Billy McDonald, at
145 pounds; Harry Tenny (champion)
vs. Harry McCloud, at 115 pounds;

Force haa played in two games with
Stanford, as a varsity man. Last year
he went into the game in the second
half, having been substitute fullback
and tackle. This year he played as
regular tackle throughout the game.
His work was brilliaxit and consistent,
and though hammered repeatedly by
Stanford's killing tandem plays he
Â¦withstood the fierce pounding and re
mained In the game to the end.
The new California captain's football
experience began at the Colorado
School of Mines, where he played for a
number of years as tackle on the North

and none of the smart ones purchased

Jim Murphy, who raced a string of
horses In California several seasons
ago, among others being Buck Massie,
was a visitor at the track yesterday.
Jere Dunn, the well known New York
turfman, whose mare Sunny Slope was
a sensational performer some years
ago. was about the ring and paddock
yesterday. This is Mr. Dunn's first
trip to California and he thinks the
track across the bay one of the most
perfectly appointed ones he has ever
seon. The Eastern horseman has a
small but select stable at Oakland.
On December 10 the firm of Burns
& "Waterhouse will sell twenty-two su
perbly bred yearlings at Oakland track.
Among the stallions represented are
Eddie Jones, Altamax, Figaro, Take
Notice and St. Avonicus.

McLaughlin put up a vigorous finish
on G. W. Trahern and had Sullivan not

TRACK NOTES.
On the strength of her showing in a
race last Saturday, Sea Voyage looked
far and away the best in ihe five Vind a
half furlonpf scramble for two-year-old
fillies. The bi^ speculators eagerly
snapped up all the 7 to 10 hung out
against the Miller entry, and it proved
a gpod investment. Piloted by Knapp,
she scored with plenty In reserve
from Lillian Ayres, the mount of
Davis. Fntre Nous ran third, after
leading almost to the stretch.
Charley Ilenshall's Meistersinper
created quite a flurry during the betr
ting on the concluding race of the day.
Opening up at C, the odd* fell to \\b,
but the "Wagner horse did nothing to
warrant the plunge.- "Kerry Patch"
McLaughlin rode the' favorite. G.
Trahern, and, after a duel through the
stretch with Fille d'Or, earned the de
cision by a scant length. Lloyd Foun
tain dropped in third with Ink, a rank
outsider from the Lamasney barn.
Mountebank made a joke of the first
six and a half furlong sprint, galloping
in at odds of 7 to 1. Diderot, which
with W! Davis in the saddle was in
stalled favorite at S to 5, .looked as if
he had been rusticating at the sea
shore, lasting long enough, however,
to dispose of Sugden for the place.
Galanthus was not ready:-
SEA VOYAGE A 'WINNER.
Not all of the short priced ones the
talent backed met disaster, however.
Elrodun. Sea Voyage and G. W. Tra
hern, three choices, registered first. The
attendance was good and the betting
brisk.
A catch-as-catch-can assortment of
platers lined up in the opening event
with Brennus starting a 17 to 10 favor
ite. "Big Bill" Knapp had the leg up
on Revolt and, outbreaking his field at
the start, won all the way. Bell, astride
the first choice, moved up by degrees,
beating out Red Damsel for the place.
The winner was quoted at 8 to 1
throughout the betting.
There were ten starters In the
maiden two-year-old affair with two
hot ones developing in .Edrodun and
Phalanx. The former with Sheehan
in the saddle finally closed favorite and
was in front from start to finish.
Andavari, a 10 to 1 chance, took the
place from Thn Reprobate by more
than a length. Phalanx ran green, but
Mill do later on.
THKEE CHOICES REGISTER.
Of course the track at Emeryville was
in a sloppy condition yesterday and.
Just as when the Police Commissioners
meet, everybody looked for something
to be doing. There was, but the long
est priced winner of the afternoon, Ven
ator, eluded the sharpshooters.
Dr. Rowell's gelding made one of a
company of six starting In the three
quarters of a mile handicap, and was
friendless and neglected at 25 and 30 to
1. Judge, from the McAlester string,
carrying Michaels and 105 pounds,
struck the public fancy about right, the
price dropping from threes to 8 to 5
favoritism. Neither Elliott nor Kenil
worth were accorded a smile, though
Royal Rogue had a few admirers. It
proved a two-horse race from the start,
Venator and the favorite giving the
others the slip. The despised outsider
possessed all varieties of speed and, ex
cellently handled by Anderson, downed
Judge a couple of lengths at the wire.
The show fell to Royal Rogue. . .

SUMMART.
The fielding was fast and sharp, al
though the diamond was wet and slip
pery. The game was played in an hour
and thirty minutes and was full of life
in each spasm. The Brownies played a
grand game, just like a big league
team. Danny Shay did some fielding
that would have made the St. Louis
fans proud of him, cutting off at least
three hits bv his good work.
Mr. Barber was an effective young
pitcher a&ainst the Brownies at Oak
land yesterday until Danny Shay ush
ered in the seventh spasm -with a re
sounding two-cushion shot out to left
field. Danny's example was straight
way followed by six other young men
and when thev all got through taking
rides on the offerings of Mr. Barber
It was curtains for the day. Score â
Portland 5, San Franolsco 1.
The Oakland ball field was never vthe
scene of a prettier nor a more spectac
ular batting bee than the one pulled
off in round seven. Every man who
advanced to the plate took a swing
on that sphere and zing! it went every
time. San Francisco was lucky to get
a run. although Jake Thielman was
stung for ten safe bingles.
The Seals had the game sewed up
and ready for delivery when Danny
fc'hay waded into a fast one in the sev
enth. It went to the left field for two.
Then Spencer laid down a bunt and
Kellackey did likewise, creating a full
house. Nadeau hit and Thielman hit
and Murdock hit and Runkle hit ana
between them* all they sent in five
runs. Each and every hit had the real
brand stamped upon it and each
counted.

* learner put in an appearance. Aware
cf the tardy pace of the Thomas and
knowing the Alameda's consistent fleet
r.ees, the Government ordered the Phil-
Si'fine mails transferred from the troop
ship to the liner, and as a result of this
S'Tesight letters from those exiled in
Vnde Sam's Oriental possessions
leached and will reach their destina
tions twenty-four hours sooner than If
they had left Honolulu two days before
liiey did.
The Alameda was three hours late in
leaving Honolulu, but favoring breezes
iind a few extra turns of her propeller
f-aved her reputation for punctuality
tnd yesterday, before the mid-day
Â¦w histles sounded, the liner was tied up
at the Oceanic Steamship Company's
v. barf, all her passengers ashore and
The work of discharging cargo well un

The Alameda brought 151 passengers
nail Â£35 tons of -cargo. Although the
wind which prevailed for the greater
l>art of the passage was bound in the
Fame direction as the liner, it kicked
up. a nasty sea and from the lands
:rran'e point of view the weather
Throughout the voyage was dlsagree
nble. With such good care, however,
does Chief Steward Clark administer to
ihe comfort of his passengers, that,
foal weather or fair, experienced trav
elers prefer the Alameda to any liner
on the Pacific. She is a good eea boat
and when she leaves Honolulu at a
certain hour her passengers can figure
upon arrival here with a certainty un
known to overland travel.
Among the Alameda's passengers
vere the following:

. - o tcken of his smashing ability the cor
jier in saJlors no longer exists and the ring
1* not. Timothy has been reading the lile
cf Philander Kr.ox. and -when the "ring" sat
back for a higher bid from the captain of
The British ehip Gaigate. Timothy decided
that eomraiBEioE or blood meney, en the scale

When Chief "Wittman returned from
the convention of Chiefs of Police In
St. Louis he spoke favorably of what
is known in Great Britain as the "fln
ger-print identification" of criminals.
It was brought to the notice of the con
vention by an inspector from Scotland
-Yard who said that in nearly two mil
lion cases not two could be found alike.
By the Chief's instructions the officers
of the identification bureau have been
studying the system, and yesterday
they put it into effect.
The mode 'Of procedure is to pour
some printer's ink on a pad and make
the prisoner press his thumb, second
finger and little- finger on it. Then the
prisoner presses his inked fingers on a
piece of paper and the Impression is
photographed. The photograph is
placed alongside the Bertlllon card
showing the measurements of the pris
oner, so there is a double identification.
"The Inspector from Scotland Yard."
said the Chief yesterday, "related a
case of two men whose features and
measurements were identical. One had
served a term for burglary and a sec
ond offense of the same kind in Eng
land means imprisonment for life. The
other was arrested for burglary, but
he protested vehemently, although con
fronted with his supposed photograph,
that he was not the man. The first
man was subsequently arrested andJthe
finger-print identification showed that
the second man was right. There Is'no
getting over it. A man's features may
change to a certain extent, but the
lines on his fingers never. The new
system will'help materially in the iden
tification of criminals and will be uni
versally adopted."

Ole Olsen. a seafaring man em
ployed by the Alaska Packers* Asso
ciation, was knocked senseless last
night by two thugs, who attempted to
rob him. He is now lying In the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital, suffering
from severe lacerations of the -scalp
and possibly a fracture of the skull.
Olsen, who while in the city makes
his home at 1237 Vallejo street,
stepped off a Hyde-street car shortly
after 11 o'clock last night and started
to- walk to his residence. When near
the door two men, who had been con
cealed in a doorway, sprang out and
one of them struck him' on the head
with a blunt instrument, felling him,
to the ground. The other attempted
to take Olsen's watch, but the chain
broke and the timepiece remained In
the sailor's pocket. The thieves were
frightened away before they wero
able to search their victim. As ha
had but 40 cents with him they would
have met with but a poor reward for
their crime. Olsen had been drinking
during the evening and is unable to
give a good description of his assail

formance at the Washington-street
Theater last night. The injured man
Is a member of the Chin familv and
says he does not know the name of hi3
assailant, but could recognize him if
he saw him again. He says he is not
a member of any tong and thinks he
was mistaken for another person. De
tective McMahon is of the same opin
ion. The Injured man was treated at
the Central Emergency Hospital, but
is bleeding internally and will probably
die.
Lee Ten Bow, a member of the
Chinese Lee family, was seriously shot
by Lee Tons:, sometimes known as
Yun? Quong, last nigrht in Baker

of anxrtd Quarrel between the wn

stealing his clothes. Tons had for
merly roomed with him and had a
key to the room. The accusation an

The weak and depressed condition of the
Apple market, so frequently noted of late, waa
still in evidence, and, although prices of choice
and fancy lots had another decline, the market
showed no sign of cleaning up. Some dealers
were still" asking $1 25 for fine .Spitzenberss
and Newtown Pippins, but there were plenty
of those varieties available at ?1 per box and
handlers were unable to effect clearances even
at the latter figure. Cheap fruit cut but' little
figure In the market, being neglected owing
to the abundance and reasonable prices of
fancy stock. Christmas Apples were offering
freely at $2 25@2 50 per box. but sold very
slowly. Berries were In moderate receipt and
generally firm, while Gripes were Inclined to
easiness. It was difficult to obtain over $1 50
for large open boxes of Grapes and there waa
Quite a surplus unsold at the close. A fair
amount of business was reported In other de
ciduous fruits and prices had but slight vari
ance. Trade In Citrus Fruits was checked to
some eStent by the threatening weather, but
previous prices ruled for all descriptions except
Grape Fruit, which was lower. The steamer

CHICAGO, Nov. 15. â Beginning with an
easier tone at the start the wheat market
gradually developed Into an extremely weak
affair. Easier cables and weather suitable for
the movement of the crop caused considerable
liquidation at the opening. Initial quotations

Information came slowly. The world's ship
ments and visible supply statement that should
have been received Monday was still dalayed,
but early In the day information was received
from a private source that Russian shipments
last week were of enormous proportions, the
largest weekly shipments from any one coun
try. Although not coming from an official
quarter, the Information apparently had con
siderable effect and materially augmented the
selling pressure. Prospects of a big Increase
in the visible supply also counted against the
lorgs. A decrease of half a million bushels
in primary receipts was apparently altogether
Ignored. Neither was any attention seemingly
given to bullish gossip from the Southwest,
telling of exhausted supplies. Another in
fluential factor tending to depress prices here
wa* weakness of the Northwestern markets,
due to expectaion of a more liberal movement
of wheat from the farms. As prices fell
numerous etop-lofs orders were reachi-d, forc
ing prices still further downward. The prin

there Is no further decline, posted buyers find
no difficulty m getting all the choice creamery
they need at 20c. The market is still burdened
with large lines of creamery, which have been

bring.

Tirey L.Â«Ford makes emphatic de
nial of the Hanford charges and does
not seem to doubt that he will be able
to prove the inaccuracy of the state
ments. Mr. Ford said:
It Is difficult to conceive how a man In
his right mind could pÂ«rmlt himself to make
the statements Mr. Hanford has Incorporated
In his pleading. It is sufficient to say that,
la so far as they charre professional or moral
delinquency they are wholly, absolutely and
maliciously false.
W e had some differences about T>ecemb*r,
1901 arlsine out of a request on. Mr. Han
ford's part that I make certain untruthful
statements, which I. of course, refused to do.
Our relations thereupon came to an end. Mr.
Hanford then grave me a written agreement,
which was executed on January 17, 1902, In
which he contracted to pay me for my past
services. This agreement was made subse
quent to the alleged unfaithfulness attempted
to be set forth In the papers Just Hied.
The public is already somewhat familiar
win Mr Hanford's vagaries. The documents
bristle with misleading statements that it
would be Idle now to refute. The charges of
unprofessional conduct, I repeat, are inex
cusable and absolutely false.
Mr. Hanford has even gone so far as to mis
state the terms and character of my employ
ment but I will not anticipate the Judicial In
vestigation of the facts. He is a defendant
endeavoring to avoid the payment of a fee
and the performance of a written promise.
This attack Is one of the penalties to which
all men render themselves liable when they
seek to compel a crafty delinquent to meet
his Just obligations.
TIREY Ia FORD'S ANSWER.
commission for him, or.more than J50Q.
000, which he would have received had
Ford remained loyal.
He says that he was left the alterna
tive of suing the Eastern capitalists to
recover or taking what they pleased to
offer. He feared to bring any action,
he says, and accepted $130,000 for his
work.
The Sutter street shares were sold
for about $3,000,000 and the Market
street stock for ?14,000,000 and Hanford
says 3 per cent would have been a fair
Hanford alleges that at about the
time of the purchase, the question of
his services and compensation came up
and the Easterners, conceding that the
services had been valuable, Btill claimed
that a large part of the work had been
performed by Ford, and they were pre
pared to contend that Ford was not
acting for him in any manner. Han
ford replied that Ford had been em
ployed by him.
Hanford says that Ford was then
trying to obtain the position as general
attorney of the railroad companies as
soon as the purchase of the stock was
consummated and he was afraid the
statement Hanford desired might mili
tate against his chances.
At that time, he says, Ford was the
duly qualified Attorney General of the
State. Hanford considered him well
fitted for the service needed 'and dis
closed to him all of his plans. Ford,
he says, immediately and eagerly ac
cepted the portion:
The deal progressed to a point when
on April 25, 1S01, the Eastern capital
ists purchased all of the shares of the
San Francisco and San Mate,o Railroad
Company. Hanford then paid Ford
$8000- on account.
In January. 1902. the Eastern capital
ists purchased the shares of the two
other lines. During the deal he had in
troduced Ford to the purchasers and
their agents as his confidential repre
sentative and adviser, and during Han
ford'3 absence, they frequently corre
sponded directly with Ford on the busi
ness in hand.
â¢ Tirey L. Ford, general attorney for
the United Railroads and former At
torney General of the State of Califor
nia, has been sued by Robert G. Han
ford for $370,000. Hanford says that he
would have received that Bum as ad
ditional commission for promoting the
sale of the stock of the San Francisco
and San Mateo, the Market street and
the Sutter street Railroad companies if
it had not been for Ford's alleged acts.
The promoter's big demand is made
In an answer and' cross-complaint to
the suit of Milton Bernard, as assignee,
for $25,465 alleged to be due for serv
ices performed by Ford for Hanford be
tween September 1, 1900, and May, 1902,
and interest thereon. Bernard's first
claim was for $12,000 as a balance due
on a demand for $20,000 for services be
tween the dates mentioned, and the sec
ond for $10,000 for additional services
rendered between January, 1901, and
May, 1902.
Hanford, In his cross-complaint, de
clares that the assignment to Bernard
was made for the purpose of concealing
Ford's identity in the suit and he says
that Bernard has no real interest in the
result. For that reason his counter
claim is directed against Ford in per
son. It is also contended that Ford's
agreement to perform the services was
void and unlawful as he was Attorney
General of tho State at the time."
As abstracted from the voluminous
defense, Hanford's story is substan
tially as follows: About September 1,
1900, he conceived the idea of interesting
capitalists in Baltimore and New York
in the street railways of this city and
neighboring counties, particularly the
San Mateo, Market street and Sutter
street lines. He thought if he could
bring about the sale of the shares at
prices satisfactory to the Eastern par
ties he would receive a large commis
sion. It would be necessary, said Han
ford, to persuade the local holders to
sell at a price that would seem profit
able to the buyers and the undertaking
would require as much work'here as in
the East. He would be compelled to
be absent for some time and would, he
said, need some one upon whom he
could rely to assist him and represent
his interests here.

By formally dissolving the engage
ment of Miss Fannie Black of 1316 De-
B. W. Hyde, an architect, convinced
Judge Cabaniss that he did not unpro
vokedly assault Mrs. A. Duriez, as al
leged by that lady. She testified that
when she visited the architect's office
in the Chronicle building to interview
him anent a disputed bill he roughly
seized and violently cast her to the
floor, but he averred that she called
him "a dirty old liar" and then lay
down and yelled for aid. Mrs. Duriez
manages a lodging-house at 143 Third
street. '
Mr. Morrissey. was bo seriously in
jured that when the case was called
before Judge Mogan a continuance
was ordered till to-morrow. Since his
divorce Schell. who is an upholsterer,
has been twice in prison for disturb
ing her peace. When his attorney
applied for ball the Judge acquiesced
by fixing the bond at $3000. The
charge is attempt to commit murder.
James A. Morrissey of 1216, Mission
street was awakened from slumber
about 3:30 o'clock yesterday morning
by sounds as if persons were scuffling
in the main corridor of his dwelling.
Springing from his couch he opened
his chamber door and a man and
woman locked in close embrace fell
into the room. Theirs was not the
interlock of affection, however, for
each was struggling for release, and
the accompanying converse was not
complimentary. In the woman Mr.
Morrissey recognized his children's
nurse, and the man he Identified as
Bradford T. Schell, her divorced
husband. While endeavoring to effect
theii* separation he was stabbed in
the groin and had his left thumb al
most severed by a knife in the
hands of the male combatant, but he
blew a whistle and managed to hold
his assailant until the police re
sponded. Then it was learned that
Schell had entered the woman's
apartments through a window and
was evidently bent on killing her when
she awbke and thwarted him as de
scribed.
The noliceman in the case averred
that Mr. Wilenski was cruelly pun
ishing one of his children when Son
in-law Strua interfered, whereupon
Mr. Wilenski pursued him with an
uplifted ax and afterward shot. at him
with, a pistol. But. the Judge catrnot
base a decision upon police testimony
alone, and said as much when he
continued the case until Saturday.
Among the witnesses were the re
spective wives of the principals, and
from their gestures it was evident: that
each lady was' loyal to the interests
of her spouse. Mrs. Strua even went
so far as to shake a plump fist at her
father, and subsequently she was*
seen to cling affectionately to her hus
band. Mrs. Wilenski was equally
true to the partner of her bosom and
similarly antagonistic to his accusers.
Other folks who testified untrans
latably were Zan Klick and his wife,
Sophia, and M. T. Arey.
Police Judre Conlan has driven
himself till next Saturday to solve
several vexing phases of the problem
presented to him yesterday morning
through the testimony adduced in the
case of John Wilenski of 31% Zoe
street, accused of attempting to mur
der his son-in-law, Isador Strua, by
shooting at him. The formal com
plaint contained all the enlightenment
that his Honor could obtain, for both
the principals and all the witnesses
are natives of a remote Polish prov
ince that boasts of a distinct dialect,
and not one of them could speak/ in
telligible English. The full corps of
court interpreters was called in to
aid in the hearing, but each of them
in turn confessed his linguistic abil
ity completely baffled. So the Judge
is undecided as to whether the com
plainant choked the defendant with
his feet or. was shot with a hatchet
in the defendant's hands. \
William Lawson, red-haired â¢ and
lanky, was accused of vagrancy, and
when he emerged from the cage to
face Judge Mogan . a bedraggled
woman awaiting trial on a similar
charge exclaimed:
'â¢Well, of all things! Hello, kid!
Where the dickens did you come
from? Well, , if this ain't rich!"
Then came the disclosure that until
three months ago the twain were one
without benefit of clergy and that
William severed the illicit tie by sud
denly disapeparing. from his wonted
haunts. He did -not seem tb relish
the unexpected meeting with his for
mer consort, while she appeared to
enjoy his discomfiture most hugely.
She laughed so heartily when he was
pronounced guilty "thar she could not
present a face of due "sobriety when
the Judge remanded her, too, for sen
tence to-day. "
* * â¢
"We wuz in th' fo'c's'le," Seaman
Albaugh told Judge Mogan, "w'en th'
bo's'n sez, 'Tike hoff yer coats an'

The boatswain was pronounced
guilty as charged and the Sabbatarian
salts assured that he will be duly pun
ished when he comes up to-day for
sentence.

William Drummond's combined Im
pecuniosity and opium hunger
prompted him to qualify as the mean
est thief on record. To obtain means
of appeasing his yearning for "hop"
he swindled a blind seller of news
papers at Â¦ Ke.irny and Sutter streets
by buying his wares and paying for
them with brass telephone checks in
stead of nickels. /The papers thus
purchased "he sold again and bought
"dope" with the proceeds. * Judge Mo
gan unctuously sentenced Mr. Drum
mond to three months' i imprisonment.
As a result of a police raid on 620
Jackson street there was unwonted
nomenclatural euphony on Judge Ca
baniss' calendar. Thirty-two women
were charged with being inmates of
a disorderly house, and the list includ
ed eleven Mauds, nine Pearls, five
Blanches, four Roses, one Gladys, one
Ruby and one Jane, the latter being
a clerical error. Their attorney de
manded a separate Jury trial for each
defendant an* the Judge compro
mised by agreeing to have two of
them tried before ' twelve good > and
true men on November 28.
Aileene^Hill must answer in the Su
perior Court the charge of having sto
len Romeo Hale's $50 diamond ring
and presenting it as a love gift to To
maso Felepedas, Romeo's rival for her
affection. Judge Mogan fixed her bail
at $500 and augmented her- woe by
dismissing the accusation of vagrancy
she had sworn to against Tomaso in
retaliation for his denial that she
gave the ring to him.
Edward T. Wheatland's fiancee,
Miss Esther Cristy, testified that her
betrothed had plenty of money of his
own before he was arrested and
charged with having stolen $325 from
Mrs. Elsie Hilflsch, by whom he was
employed as a bartender at 249 Stev
enson street. Miss Cristy wore a sky
blue broadcloth with burned . yellow
braiding. She knew, all about Ed
ward's pecuniary condition prior to
his arrest, because the wedding day
was set and they had discussed house
furnishing, Judge Cabaniss contin
ued the hearing till to-day.
Mr. Fleming was promptly given six
months, double the term that the
Judge had Intended to prescribe. Ed
ward Ordway, who aided Mr. Fleming
in pilfering lead, was sentenced to
three months.
"Mahany, ye're a bum bull. If it
hadn't a-bin for Jimmy Kavanagh
I'd a-licked ye, an' a-licked ye good.
Youse fly. cops oughtah be a-plckin'
prunes, youse make me tired."
After adopting Judge Fritz's sug
gestion that he plead guilty of petty
larceny, William J. Fleming addressed
Special Officer Mahany, on the wit
ness stand, as follows:-
On the charge of selling liquor with
out license in his fruit store at Sac
ramento and Devlsadero streets F. Bel
docchi will be given a hearing to-day by
Judge Mogan. He wanted to plead guil
ty and pay a small fine, but the court
declined the proposal.
The jilted one chewed a stubbly mus
tache while the lady told her tale in
court, and he said not a word when the
Judge opined that it is a woman's pre
rogative to change her mind and ex
tend the mitten as often as she pleases,
nor did he permit himself to speak
when he was advised to return to San
Jose and study forgetfulness. Miss
Black fairly beamed her gratitude at
the bench when the decree came down
that she could not be compelled to re
turn the material love tokens bestowed
upon her by the unhappy defendant.
For a year Miss Black and Mr. Selt
zer were affianced. Their union was
considered advisable' for business as
well as sentimental reasons, for he was
a tailor and she a cleaner of clothing.
He occasionally came from San Jose to
see her, and so unchanged was her de
meanor toward him prior to her dec
laration of independence that the blow
came like a thunderbolt from an un
clouded sky. She abruptly told him
that he was of too nervous a tempera
ment to suit her and she considered it
wiser to back out of the engagement
than to consign herself to a life of marl
tal incompatibility. Instead of accept
ing his conge and donning sackcloth
he went and obtained a marriage li
cense, purchased a plain gold ring, re
turned to her presence and neurotically
renewed his suit. She was polite, but
firm, and when his pleading gave way
to upbraiding she caused his arrest for
disturbing her peace;
visadero street to J. Seltzer of San
Jose, ' Judge Mogan conveyed evident
elation of spirit to the lady, which was
not decreased by his Honor's supple
mentary opinion that she was not
bound either in honor or by law to re
turn the betrothal presents to their
donor.
