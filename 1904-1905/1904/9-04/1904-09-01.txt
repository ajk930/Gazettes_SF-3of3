Circuit Court to-day, and the. National
Association o % Retail . Druggists, of
which, they are members, "was fined
$2000. white Thomas W. "Woolen, secre
tary of the. organization, ,/wa3 fined
$500. The cases against five wholesale
druggists of Chicago, also charged with
contempt, were continued until the fall
term of court, when it will be necessary
for them to take additional proof into
court to purge them of the contempt
charges. Â¦
The .injunction under which the
druggists' association was fined was
secured by Isaac Platt, a retail drug
gist of Chicago, in November.- 1902, and
restrained them from interfering In
any manner with the securing of sup
plies by Platt, who had incurred the
association's displeasure, Jt was
charged, because he'would not Join it.
.. -'Platt has been deprived of the right
in this community to sell goods," Judge
Dunne said in rendering- his decision.
"Nothing can be more clear. It is a
combination Â¦ that has prevented him
from securing supplies, and thi3 court
enjoined the defendants in this â¢ case
from carrying out their plan to prevent
Platt obtaining goods."
. Platt charges that he has been black
listed and boyectted by the association
and that through its Influence all the
wholesale' houses in. Chicago have re
fused to sell him supplies. The associ
ation made its defense upon the plea
that Platt was attempting to sell the
goDds at wholesale, thu3 cutting the
prices.

The excursion train, made up of ten
coaches and a baggage car, carried
about 1000 persons\ bound for the exhi
bition in Sherbrooke. The Island Pond
train was composed of five coaches and
a baggage car and had only a small
number of passengers. - The excursion
train had barely cleared the Richmond
yard when, rounding a curve, it met the
Island Pond train running at- high
speed. The engineers reversed and,
with their firemen, jumped and escaped
with minor injuries.
Both engines were locked firmly to
gether.- The baggage car of the excur
sion train was picked up and dropped
on top of the car following it, a smoker,
and it was in these two cars that the
greater number of fatalities occurred.

Sheriff McMahon organized armed
bands of deputies, who searched every
part of the woods near the spot where
the man was last seen. In addition,
a bloodhound was got from this city
to. the scene of the shooting and put
on the trail. Every effort was made to
capture the man, but at dark search
ers returned to their homes for the
night, having found no trace of him.
To-day's shooting is a sequel to the
recent robbery of Dr. Hartwell, who
two weeks ago was induced by a con

to purchase some alleged Government

It was also announced by President
Donnelly that he hafl made a.rrange
inents for a strike of tire switchmen on
the railroads doing business in -the
stockyards, and that in a short time
the packers would find it impossible to
chip out their products." Tbe switch
men, however, refused to strike.
To men of moderate means this price
f.ljl hÂ«? prohibitive, and thousands who
lequire ir.cat.to sustain their strength
for manual labor suffer.
It is possible ths.t snail qaanlities oi
beef 'may be shipped in by country
butchers, but they cajinot supply
enough to brin? dwn the price. Poul
try and eggs will advance in sympathy
v.ith beef and the enforced increase in
the consumption of vegetables will
send those co:nmodities up also.
The wholesalers see no way to meet
the demands and actual famine condi
tions cannot be averted in a feu- hours.
they say. I Anticipating the famine thÂ«
Fulton and South Water street mar
kets were scenes of -great activity to
day. Supplies <>f beer were sent to the
Armour. Kwift and Morris cold storage
plants In South Water street from, the
Fulton market in preparation to reap
a harvest from the famine prices that
v ill prevail before the end of the week.
These cold storage plants have been
empty for weeks.
The packers say that the conditions
Â¦uill be exactly the reverse of what
they have been, and that now the
email market men will have to buy
their beef from them or Â£<Â» without,
because they can no longer get supplies
froj^i the independent men.
All thÂ« lart;e restaurants -w-Jll be
able to store beef for their trade, but
not enough, to stand a prolonged sleg>?.
The masses are to be the reil sufferers.
The efforts, of President Donnelly of
the Butchers' Union to spread the
strike against the packers throughout
ail trades that are in any way connect
ed with the packing house industry
â¢via* only partially successful to-day.
The first step was in calling out the
men employed by the independent
packers and the stock handlers that
Â¦were still at work for those packers
epiinst whom the original strike was

ron on July 22. The period for taking
an appeal will be extended until the
parties in the United States who are
interested in the appeal prepare their
papers.
It Is plain, however, that the Jap
anese are no longef enjoying th"e su
periority in artillery which "stood them
in such good. -stead in the earlier
months of the war. It- was then hill
fighting and the Japanese mountain
batteries, in which arms the -Russians
were deficient, told with deadly effect.
XoW the contest is hi; a comparatively
open country where both the Russian
field guns and' the Russian cavalry can
come into more .effective use.
â¢ The Japanese .are using -balloons to
locate the Russian .guns .and trenches.
One of the Russian correspondents of
the Associated Press points out that
the Japanese'sent up a .balloon shortly
after daylight- to the 'southeast of Liao

be using mortars to drop, shells into

sian position. .One correspondent also
mentions a Japanese movement to the
hortheaet of showing thaj.

SUPREME TEST OF ENDURANCE-
One of the surprising phases of the
situation is th.e -endurance of the -men.
They have been . engaged . desperately
for two days, after more or less. severe
fighting under unfavorable condi-tions
every day -since -August~24i- -It- woirid
seem that human endurance could n.6t
persist much longer without- respite* of
some sort.
â¢ The- battle ftf Liaoyang probably will
fank. as one of. the great sanguinary
battles of history. ' It is .estimated by
the general staff* that the Japanese
armies 'engaged â¢" number seventeen, di
visions of 15,000 men." each., or. allow
i-hg for" Inefflcientp, -about 240,000 men.
Kach "division; has thirty-six guns and
there .are, two independent artille.ry
Ijrijrades- of 100 'guns each, making a
total of about 800 guns. 'The estimates
of Russian correspondents .range from
600 to 1000 suns per side.
It is believed here that, in view of
the. numbers engaged, the desperate
nt-ss of the assait&s and the -length of
the .line (about seven miles), the losses
in- the. two days' fighting cannot fall
short Qf 10,000 on each side. Both sides
are -straining every nerve, realizing
that 'the fortunes of war for a whol^
>ear are in the scale; and neither side
is in the mood or the position to spare
nxen in- the effort to achieve a final
victory. ' â¢ ic'rt^.'- â¢"
The highest military authorities here
consider that the most critical stage
of the battle has not yet been reached
arid they believe that the fight may
continue for some time before either
side acknowledges defeat.. This is an
important consideration by the li^ht
of which to interpret any immediate
news. ;.;":'â¢>,'
XOSSES REACH INTO THOUSANDS.
"I can assure you that up to this
hour communication with Liaoyang
has not been interrupted. General Ku
ropatkin has taken particular precau
tions against any attempt to cut the
railway. "While it is always possible
that a small raiding party might slip
through the Russian .patrols- or that
hired Chinese "bandits might cut the
telegraph, it is a fair supposition, in
view of all the facts, .that this has
not been done." ...
ST. PETERSBURG," Sept., V 2
a, m.â With' the knowledge , that the
Russian and Japanese* armies; about
Liaoyang are locked in a death strug
gle, the tension In St. j Petersburg to
night is strained to the utmost. It is
believed here tliat. the fight; cannot
stop short of the crushing defeat of
one side or the other.- . ; . '
All reports ' so far are favorable to
the Russians, though^hesuspenslbn "of
all news for many hours. ha^ been; ex
ceedingly trying and has given rise to
several rumors somewhat tempering
the earlier enthusiasm.
It is stated officially." however, that
the report- that ~thÂ« -railway and -tele
graph have been cut north of Liao
yang is untrue. A member of the gen
eral staff said at midnight:
Losses of Russians and Japanese in the First Xwo Day s|. Fighting

Sanguinary. Combat Is Yet to Come."
A Japanese torpedorboat destroyer ar
rived here last night at 10 o'clock, hav
ing come over at top speed from Port
Dalny, and at once ..took on board all
the money on the Independent with the
exception of $15,000. The destroyer then
left. , . , . .u. ...,.-. Â¦ : ; Â¦ ; â¢;
Notwithstanding official denials there
is 1 every. -reason to Relieve that the In

money, ithe , maximum estimate upon
which is $5,000,000, destined to pay" Gen
eral Kuroki's array. - .-. Â¦ ,Â¦ . Â¦':"',]

trality of China will be violated, arid he

ferred the question to the Japanese
Minister Â«in Peking. The Commissioner
of Customs, on his-Bide,. has. referred it
to Sir Robert Hart, chief of the Chi

Century Hall, 1213 Sutter street, and
during the session Dr. Richard C
Cabot of Harvard University and the
Massachusetts General Hospital and a
famous blood specialist . addressed a
large audience.
;In his) opening remarks Dr. Cabot
spoke of the general advantage
women had over men in the field of
nursing, both from aptitude for deli
cate work and from intuitive sympa
thy. "â¢; The method of instructing
nurses of the present day he deplored,
saying that as they received much of
their instruction by free lectures the
students suffered thereby. The only
way to properly establish ; a course of
education for novices is to Include the
paid lecture. Dr. Cabot added, how
ever, that ; personally > he had learned
little; from lectures. All his knowledge
he had gained by working out his own
problems.
; Many perplexing questions were
asked during the, evening, but the lec
turer was equal to every emergency.
He closed with the plea for; the nurses
to fix - a | certain ; standard below which
a nurse could hot Â¦ fall without losing
her right to the title.

. ."It was our first victory. The
enemy was beaten back everywhere,
many of his batteries were destroyed
and in some cases his infantry was put
to rout." .
LJAOTA2S'G, Atig- 3Lâ At 5 o'clock on
Tuesday " morning ' the Japanese ap
peared .on the hills. e&st and southeast
of Liaoyang. A't 11 o'clock, the Japanese
infantry advanced very boldJy from the
south on Mw:nt Shoushan and toois
the S-lllaces nine versts-soilth of Llab
yang on â¢ the railway line. I watched
them from ShoushaB-. 'â¢
. The Russian shells did great execu
tion, l" saw a- pile of about a score of
khaki-elad Japanese -bodies, 'the result
of a single shell falling .in front "of
Sboushan from a Russian trench. When
this shell fell the Japanese linf an try-be
gan to fire. â¢ " â¢â¢
At 3. o'clock, the Russians advanced
on the Japanese from the *vest si.de of
the njll", singing- and hurrahing,' with
bands playing- * .
The result is still undecided. A driz
zling rain -is tailing, and the ground is
very Wet. The Japanese are Dressing
hard on the east of Liaoyang. The Rus-
Eians are usiiig balloons to ascertain
the Japanese positions.
The Chinese in Liaoyang are much
excited". â¢ Business is suspended and the
streets are filied with people coming
from the country, -with children and
valuables. The Chinese merchants have
organized a police force."
. The Japanese attacking the trench in
front of Shoushan were reinforced four
times, but the trench was not taken by
6 o'clock in the evening.

SOME QF THOSE WHO WILL, AS
, SIST IN WELCOMING VISITING
' KNIGHTS TEMPLAR.
DURING the week'of Septeniber 9 t there'\vi]l be in .San.Frapr.
cisco a large" gathering of Knights Templa^* who will: there â¢
come together in Triennial Conclave. The members of this
conclave, togetlirr with their accompanying friends, will rep- ..
resent every State and Territory In the Union. : They will come here .
eitlMT bearinr with. them pleasant memories of previous visits to the .
Golden State, or with their minds full of pleasant anticipations re
ceived from those who; have already enjoyed our hospitalities.' The.
members of this great organization are among the most prominent
and influential of the people of the States and . Territories f rom â¢
whence they will come; they represent all the learned â¢professions,
are hi?h in the confidence of the business and political worlds, and
upon their verdict will, to a very great extent, rest our reputation
as a State.
It behooves us therefore to exert ourselves (not only those' of us
who arc members of the order, but also every Californian) to the end
that these visitors may be properly received, entertained and sent
homeward rejoicing that the Templars were fortunate enough. to
have held another conclave hi California. And that our people will
do this I have no doubt. GEORGE C. PARDEE,
Governor of California.
A ROYAL welcome from the great city of the golilen West to the
new pilgrimage, to the marching hosts of Templar Knights
now en route from direction and soon to enjoy repose
and recreation by the sunset shore of our great Western sea.
Welcome, Kniglits of the Temple, brilliant order or high pur
pose, aims ami aspirations; welcome to California and to her chief
city, welcome to the hospitality, the friendship, the homes and the
hearts of all our people.
Welcome to a city and to a State proud . of their sisterhood In
our great American republic, proud of their own citizenship, proud
of their visiting hosts and of the thoughts, the principles and better
civic ami domestic life for which they stand.
Welcome to a city and to a State which but a few. years ago
seemed on the very outskirts of the world's civilized life, soon, how
ever, to become, perhaps, Its very center. : .Â¦ Â¦
Welcome to a city which stajnis at the open gate of Oriental
commerce for the American people, which is to be the American
emporium of the teeming commerce with which the broad Pacific
Ocean will soon be alive.
Welcome to the city which to-day looks westerly over 6000 miles
"of ocean to the Philippines and the Far East, the warder of Ameri
can civilization, of American commerce and of American interests
In the East, and to-morrow will, through the isthmian canal, look to
proud participation in the life, .the business and. the civilization of
the older West and, the newer East â the continent of Europe and
our own Atlantic coast.
Welcome to a city whose future grandeur will grow by steps
""and bounds so" great that even In the memory of the oldest of our
guests the glory of to-day will soon seem the faded vision of yes
terday in tlie brilliant light of that which is to come.
. Welcome to San Francisco, metropolis and clearing-house of
Calif oniia; welcome to our sunshine, our frnlt and our flowers:
welcome to enjoyment and a share In our material prosperity and
in our happiness and contentment. Rnt above and beyond all, wel
come, thrice welcome Â¦ to the sincere good will, the cordial regard
an<l the hearty appreciation of onr entire people, who, irrespective
of rare, or creed, without regard to class ; or station, extend to you
-through me the Offering of their "continnous and wannest hespital-

was first suggested many thought it
would jprove a failure. From its in

"Regarding the business of the Al

this company does not handle on con

growers. They handle their own fruit,
and fruit purchased on what is known
as an f. o. b. basis. Consequently, the
way they handle their cars can be of
no interest to any-, one else except
themselves." ' ".-'â¢:â¢â¢' .Â¦â¢::- ';;Â¦:-
â¢The California Fruit Distributors,
of which I am manager, is practically

shipments routed over the Southern

ors ai the request .of-' the Alameda

Association did not state' the grounds*
of. its protest; leaving that for a -future
ti'rae,' and the Supervisors' immediately
â¢deferred the- consideration of the bids,
which, were" sent ra at the last meet
ing, and decided to confer with the
representatives of the Alameda Coun
ty Association at the meeting on Mon

The directors of the Board of Trade
discussed the matter at length this

East. It Was the unanimous .opinion
of the directors that" work : on the
boulevard- should be pushed' to comple
tion, and a resolution- to. this effect was
adopted and. a committee compos.ed of
Directors Hogan, Keller, Booth and
Secretary Stearns was ; appointed to
appear before the ' Supervisors at their
next rneetinc and urge that the work
be proceeded with.
The Merchants' Exchange also dls-.
cussed the matter and listened to citi
zens from- Haywards who appeared, to
ask'their support. The drrettors of the
exchange expressed themselves as ip
favor of the completion of the road at.
Â¦as early a date as possible, and a com
mittee was- appointed to iirj?e this with
the Supervisors. The committee is.
.composed 'â¢ of Directors Atper, -Lea,
Young, Schleuter and Mailer.
It is understood that the members of
the Alameda- County Association will
urge .that a different line, be estab
lished, that the- terminus in Oaklandis'
not "a good .-.one. and that the" road
should be nJn higher upon the side of
the hills. As the rights of way. have

- "My attention was called to the case
Monday. moFning," said. Dr. Allen to
day. "I found the jaws set and the
child suffering gr-eatly.- I telephoned
the Health Office to take charge of the
case, . but there being .ho 'response I
attended .the. child myself:.Subsequent
ly I called Dr. .-Ellis into consultation
and Tie confirmed my diagnosis. It was
too late then to save tlie child's life..
An effort had bÂ«jen made to show that'
'ijncleanliness caused the blood poison
to develop,' but in my' opinion the'
child's condition was -just. right to' con
tract such a disease after vaccination..
If she had not been vaccinated- she
would have, been alive now."
The father! of tJhe child charges that
Djr. Woolsey avoided his .responsibility
in -the case, but to this the doctor re-"
plies that his responsibility ended with
the -vaccination operation. In defense
of hjs action in the case Dr. Woolsey
says: ' \
As" vaccination officer it is my duty to
vaccinate hundreds of children that come to
my office. . Thin; child . was one of them and I
treated her with* the same Government-Inspect
ed vlrtie as the others. My duty ends after
I have applied the j virus, and as all further
treatment by., me is"" gratuitous I am not ex
pected to 'keep track 6t'- these hundreds of
cases, much Megs visit them at their homes.
Â¦ It is worthy of remark that of the hundreds
of vaccinated children this one child .should
have succumbed to the operation. ' From what
I know of the. case the trouble, was, unsanitary
conditions surrounding the girl a.t her home.
Ct-rtalnly the antl-vaccinationists-have no- right
to claim that vaccine was wholly responsible
when* hundreds' of other children have passed
thrrugh the ordeal safely.
The public may be interested In the official
dr.ta of the case. The child was vaccinated
on August 6 and .went on' with her school
work for twenty days before she became 111.
The Incubation of acute . tetanus Is "within
ten days and never exceeds twlvc days, hence
it Is Impossible the girl should have acquired
tetanus at the time of vaccination. ; ;
As "far aa my dealings with the case are
concerned I want to say that I knew nothing
of. the danger to the child until two days ago.
when' I was called by Dr. Allen to look at
the child. 'I went, supposing that It was his
case. The address was wrong. and I epent the
greater part o'f .the night locking for the
hoiue. which I did â¢ not find. I fall to â¢ see
just how I was responsible for this deiith.
The funeral of .the child will be held
from a local undertaker's at 2 o'clock
to-morrow afternoon.
That the child died from lockjaw as
the direet : result .of vaccination the
physicians who participated in the case
dp not doubt, but they do not T< agree
that death was absolutely unavoidable.
Dr. Frank R. Woolsey," as vaccination
officer for Berkeley, performed the. op
eration in this case, but he maintains
that the blood poisoning that killed the
child was not the result of the applica
tion of the vims, but of the unsanitary
conditions-surrounding her home 'life.
On the other hand, Dr. Woodson W.
Allen,' who. treated the child in her last
illness, declares that the c'hild's condi-'
iion was not. due mereiy to lack of san- ;
itatipn. .
The child was vaccinateQ on August
6 by Dr. Woolsey. 8h.e continued going
to school' until last Friday, when she
first began to show symptoms 'of seri-.
ous illness. By Monday- the child was
In. such a condition that" Dr. Allen was;
called in, and subsequently Dr. C- Z.
Ellis. The disease, -which, the physi
cians diagnosed as lockjaw, continued
to progress, ho.wever, until this morn
ing, when the patient passed away. Dr.
Allen's refusal, to sign the death'cer
tificate precipitated the. case into the
hands of the ; Coron.er, so that there will
be an investigation.

advised the local imtriigration office that.- legislation will soion be
sought by which Chinese applying for admission to this, country as members

Whatever may *e the value of .Commissioner Sargent's proposed inno
vation, in the inspection of applicants for admission to this country, it is cer
tain that. the change cannot bc'-taken as a reflection -upon the. method's of the
Chinese-.Bureau here in San Fnanciirco. A half hour spent 'in the courtroom"
of -Court Commissioner Heactfck during the. examination , 'of Chinese immi
grants suspected "by the bureau* is convincing evidence of the caution-exer
cised to circumvent the duplicity of the slant-eyed sons of the Flowery King
dom. " r Better that our immigration officers, should make admittance, to this
country even as through the eye qf a needle than that the least latitude given
should flood us with, a Ihorde of obnoxious Chinese. .

PRETTY ROMANCE
OF INDIAN MAID
AND MOHAWK BRAVE
Two' yoqng people 'marry, and he
finds* that he knew .as- little about.his
wife as. she did about him. The high
spirits- and constant cheerful alacrity
in. matters. . of arfjusement were the
'gifts of voiith and | health " and shade
with; beautiful ease int'p peevishness,
discontent an'd a restless- desire for
new amusements and distractions.' The
constant. attentions of the .suitor give
place to thfl indifterence of the hus
band,; and the disappointed, wife" .utters
complaints long ahd loud that he is
by no.* means the devoted slave. she- was
led* to believe him. .. He retorts that
if she. were as cheerful and amiable,
as well dressed and trim, as he -once
had known her, he should Jbe as much
in love â it is he who is disappointed
and has a right to complain, etc.
'The'matrhnonial question "as to "scis*;
sors" Is well started and goes on until
one or the other gets' flung into the well
or perhaps flings himself or herself into
some <Juud sea of despair.
Think how men .and women re'ply to
the query as to which.' member -of', the
opposite sex" is the- one b'est. adapted
for. a lifelong companionship, -this Â¦ fee

Us at.sorne period -has had it propourid.

decided it in- a manne'r differing from
what we should have, selected had we
better understood ih<| matter. "

Casey's tale of distress when Mrs. Kate
Harris of 219 Crescent avenue appeared
and swore to a complaint alleging that
the defendant was a drunkard and
failed to provide, for. his family's maim
tenance. Then the Judge remanded
Mr. Casey for further investigation.
â¢ .Xels C. â¢ JohaTinessen - -declared â¢â¢ that
never again will he champion the ca"use
of a wife abused by her husband. He
was driven- to that determination by
the' inconsistent "conduct of Mrs.. John
Johanson of 371 Harriet street.- First
she urged Mr. Johannessen'to formally
lodge comp-laint; against her spouse ori
the charge of beating her and therishe
mounted the witness stand in. the court
dt Police Judge Cabaniss artd^ averred
that she and the defendant could get .
along nicely together if such people
as'Mr. JohanneSseri would refrain from,
butting into their .domestic jars. Mr^
Johanson .was unfortunate Jn his = in
ability to obtain employment/ she said,
but he was neLther cruel. nor willfully
.neglectful of 'his family.
To s"2y that .Me. .Joharines6en; was
astounded by Mrs. -Johanson's testi
mony would' convey ah ina-dequate-.de-"
ecription of his Â«tate of mind, it made
him speechless and he rubbed lils ears
as if he suspected them of practicing
deceit. .Then he reiterated his story
with accentuated emphasis, Asa ro<jm-.
â¢cr and boarder..' in -the Johanson domi-.
t-ile,- he siid, he could "not .avoid gogni
zioice of the fact that' Mr. Jbbanson's 1
treatment of his family was shameful.
Mrs. Johanson' was left to provide; for
herself -and the chiltfreh' as> best she
could, while, her. .husband idled .away,
.his time and got drunk wh$n lie. could.
â¢About the only thing savoring of woi'k
that Mr.. Johanson did was, to eseort
his Wife to ai>d from, the place, where
she earned a scant livelihood for Â¦âher
family, arid he did that onry because
he feared that somebody might "tell
: her she w"as entitled' to. an [easier ex
istence. Mr. Johannessen lived with,
the Johansons- because he desired .to
heip the woman and- little- o.nes, but[ his
blood fairly boiled every, tinie he; cast
eyes on Mr. Johanson. The. battery'
for which the arrest, was made came
within Mr. Johannessen's direct obser
vation, it consisted 6f Mr. Johanson
striking Mrs. Johanson's arm violently
with his fist and then shaking .her"
roughly,'- his only provocation being a:
hint dropped by her, to the effect that
she' hoped he would, soon get a Job.'
Mr. Joharinessen's first impulseâ trans-'
mitted through a line of- chivalric an
cestry extending into .remote Norse-his
tory â was to- fell Mr. . Johanson with a
blow, and that impulse' would certainly'
.have been obeyed if Mrs; j. ohansoh had'
hot Interceded and suggested the en
lfstment. of. law to avenge .-her wrong-
Mr. Johannessen theji went and s"wd.re
to the- complaint.
'Mrs. Jchan.eon's defense of her.hus-'
band misht have obtained his release
if Mrs. John Pettee, superintendent} of
.the -Universal Service Society, had not.
corroborated Mr. Johaftnessen's testi
mony as Â«.to the defendant's general
worthlessness and contributed some
new testimony afong the same line. She
opined that Mrs. Johanson had changed
her attitude toward the defendant be
cause she was afraid of â¢ him. Mrs.
Pettee* hid seen the evidence of . the
battery on the woman's arm and Mrs.
Pettee was 'prepared to have the chil
dren taken care of If the man was sent
to " jail. Mrs. Pettee confessed she -had
"butted in," and she proposed to "biitt
fn" whenever a helpless woman and
little children are being ill treated by
their natural protector.
Mr. Johanson was given three months^
in the County Jail. " .' : <

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 31. â Doc
Newton and Joe Corbett, as opposing
pitchers in. to-day's game between Los
Angeles and San Francisco, drew the
largest week day crowd of the season
to Chutes Park. The same, which re
suUed in a score of 6 to 5 in 'favor
of Los Angeles, was the most exciting
flnteh of the year. The locals fieldea
miserably during the first few innings
and gave San" Francisco three runs
oji as many hits. At the same time
they were unable to do anything with
Corbett's pitching until the ninth in
ning, when four hits netted three runs
and tied the score. In this Inning
Brashear went in to bat for Xewton,
which put the. pitcher auf of the
game. Baum took his place. Neither
side scored in th6 tenth, but in the
eleventh San Francisco made ' two
runs. Los Angeles- came back with a
bombardment of Corbett. Wheeler
batted for Baum and drove In two
runs with a double and scored himself
a moment 'later .when Flood drove the
ball past Irwin. "Attendance, '4000.

against the field, was rank in scoring
fdr *the opening heat and delayed the
start for some time. When finally
the word vivas given Tlverton shot
across to the pole, with the favorite
in hot pursuit. These relative positions
were maintained to the wire, the former
winning by a length.
â¢ The second heat was a duplicate of
the first and then the judges took a
hand in the affair by removing Smith
from behind Sweet Marie and substi
tuting Alta McDonald. For the third
heat Tiverton led, to 'well beyond the
half, when Sweet Marie moved up and
they raqcd like a team to the seven
eighths pole. .* At this point the New
York gelding weakened and Sweet
Marie won by a length. The time for
the heat, 2:06U, is the race record for
the year made by trotters. This was
the decisive point in the contest, for
while Tiverton tried his hardest in tho
next two heats, Sweet Marie held him
safely.

A new busher In the person of Mr.
Hastings was trotted out before the
admiring throng yesterday at Recrea
tion Park by Mr. J>ugdale. This'young
man probably meant well, but he didn't
have the" goods in his possession. He
got his in that one inning, and the- fans
had enough of him. After this Butler
took up the burden and did better, but
the same was lost- at all events and no
body seemed to care. Score â Oakland 7,
Portland 0.
.The j'oung man of- the bushes started
Ta by walking Ganley and Francks.
"Â£hen to make the mixup a good one
Beck booted. Dunleavy's grounder. A
full house and three runs after Artie
Kruger unloaded a double to center. A
base on balls was the lot of Julie
Streib. Brick Devereaux had a hit, and
sordid Byrnes.- This last one brought
the grand total' up. to* five, and that
held 'cm all for a while. J, : -?:
The busher was allowed â¢ to remain
on the bench after that one tryout, ard
Butler came along. to mystify the Com
muters. He pitched a' good game of
kail, allowing two runs during the re
mainder of the game and four more
hits. Oakland had all varieties of gin
:ger when the big lead was assumed
;and there was no stopping them.
: Buchanan was everything the Brown
ies hoped he would not be. He had 'em
all on his staff, and in" every round.
The four hits made off his offerings
were all scattered and did no harm. At
that, the Brownies hit him hard at
time?, but all the good drives landed in
somebody's mitt. The score:

The start was bad, Dainty being
practically left at the post when the
barrier was sprung. â¢ Gunfire went to
the front in. the first few strides and
led her field a hot pace. 'Rounding into
the back stretch she was^leading by a
length over Caughnawaga, with Hurst
Park in third place. At the- far turn
Burns sent Caughnawaga up to the
leader. Dainty, which gradually closed
up her lost ground, raced into third po
sition on the far turn. Coming into the
stretch; Caughnawaga was leading,
but Dainty was not to be denied, and
in a harddrive, -which, lasted from the.
head of the stretch to the wire, Caugh
nawaga won by half a length.
Artful, winner of the Futurity on
Saturday, added another victory to her
list by winning the $10,000 GrÂ«ft Filly

eoupledMn the betting and were held at
the prohibitive odds of 1 to 15. Artful
and Belle Strome, an added starter,
ran close together to the stretch, where
Artfur -dre"w away and won under
wraps by half a length in the fast time
of 1:1-1 3-5. This is one-fifth of a sec

I had bolls rcaging from five to twenty in

S. S. S. seemed to be just the medicine
needed in my case. It drove out all impu-

The attending physician says he will
be able to start for home*on Sunday
with the other representatives of the
Pacific Athletic Association * who are
here. Garcia says the dust stirred up
by the automobiles that preceded the
runners is responsible for his col}apse.
The day was warm, .with some humid
ity, not a good one for California's
athletes.

en's singles tennis tournament for the
championship of the coast .closed last
night, when the "drawings were held.

Drummond MacGavin, State champion.
Goss, the Oregon State champion, is

The ladies' singles will possess more
class than any similar tournament ever
held In this country. Besides Miss May
Sutton, the national champion, her
three sisters, who are as clever as the
best Eastern players, will also com
pete. Many of the other players; such
as Miss Dobbins, Miss Shoemaker, Miss
Hotchkiss and Miss Ratcliffe. would be
considered great players if the Suttons
were not here. . .

being willing to take additional supplies at

â¢ There was another large line of 1408 tons
of Hay in yesterday. There seems -to be no
cessation of this flood from the country. Prices
stood the same, however, â¢ as dealers do not
think /that the demand will be improved any
by accepting lower figures. ' Besides. . buyers'
bids are so low that in many cases sellers pay
no attention to them. There is no further
change in Fecdstufls.
The' circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"There seems to be no relief in the way of
a lessening of Hay shipments, for the rush
still continues. 5800 tons having arrived during
the past week. This makes a total for the
month of close on to 25,000 tons. . an unpre
cedented record. It rather looks now as
though the end had about been reached, for
buyers are now keeping away from the coun
try, and what remains unsold will seek every
possible means of storage rather than be
forced onto the market here upon unwilling
buyers. In spite of the rush of Hay, strictly
choice grades have held their own quite firmly,
and It is only the poorer lots, of which there
is so much this season, that are finding euch
exceeding slow sale. There is no denying the
fact that trade is light here this season, for
all dealers are reporting a much more limited
demand than . for several years past.
"No new or Interesting features o f the mar
ket can be reported, for. although quite a bit
of Hay is still going south, yet in all other
directions the demand is quiet.
"As to the future of the market; at present
everything points toward a quiet winter. So
much of an Increase in country stocks will be
reported that unless a' dry season threatens
there will "probably -be but little advance on
present prices for several months to", come. It
13 to be expected that Hay. will sell for enough
above the present range to cover storage and
Insurance, but beyond this there Is little prom
ising . at ' present. -â¢-

at somewhat lower prices."

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Aug. 31. â The stock market
to-day bore the usual ante-holiday aspect.
Price movements were rather irregular and
business was in little volume. Those traders
who were not really bearish seemed Inclined
to reduce their commitments. The reasons for
this was the heaviness of internationals in
London, operations dwindling to nominal pro
portions preceding definite news from the
great conict In the Far East. The contrary
tendency of Missouri Pacific, Missouri. Kansas
and Texas. Atchison preferred, Colorado South
ern and other properties, whose earnings are
likely to be adversely affected by any serious
damage to the corn crop, also helped to check
the upward course of the list. The. wheat
situation was again watched with unusual in
terest, and the unsettled condition of the
cotton market was viewed with disfavor.
Nevertheless, Etocks were not offered with
any considerable freedom, and there was an
absence of the previous day's liquidation. The
United States Steel shares and Amalgamated
Copper led the industrial group. London being
spain a reported purchaser of Steel preferred.
Indecision marked the course of the market
e!l through the early eession. The list became
more unsettled in the late trading, many of
the active issues touching the lowest prices
of the day. The weakness became more pro
nounced at the close, and a great majority
of the active icEues made net looses.' United
States Stwl preferred made a 1 point gain.
Trading for London account aggregated about
70,000 shares.
Old United States registered 4 per cent bonds
advanced % of 1 per cert and the same Issue
coupons Â«j of 1 per cent, Â¦ while the new 4s
declined % of 1 per cent on call.
Business in railway and speculative issues
was unusually heavy. Total sales (par value)
were 96,745.000.

CHICAGO, Aug. 31. â The Influence of poor
threshing returns and unfavorable weather In
the Northwest finally gained the ascendency
over the light primary receipts to-day, and as. a
result the wheat market closed firm, with De
cember up %@>%c. Heavy rains In Manitoba, and
the Dakotas imparted some firmness at the open
ing, December being %c lower to %o higher,
at 91 07% to 91 08%. On the slight advance
there was liberal selling by some of the recent.
bulls, who were beginning to fear that there
might soon be receipts of new spring wheat
in sufficient quantity to cause temporary de
pression, at least, in thÂ« market. Commission
houses were fair buyers, but the demand was
net sufficient to absorb all the offerings. Â» As a
result â¢ a weak tone developed, December . de
clining to 91 07%. Later a weather Bureau
prediction of continued rain In both the wheat
and corn regions revived the enthusiasm of the
bull leaders. With the aid of shorts, who had
taken advantage of the break to cover freely,
the market soon became strong, December ad
vancing to 91 00. At the same time reports
of poor threshing returns had some influence
on trading. An estimate of 670,000,000 buahels
as the totaal yield of wheat for the United
States and Canada, . made by & Canadian crop
expert, also aided in forcing up prices for Sep
tember. As an offset to these bullish Influences,
however, the Southwest reported a decided in
crease in primary receipts. During the latter
part of the session trading was light, most of
the business being in changing from Septem
ber to the more distant months. Much of the
advance was lost, but the market closed firm,
with December up %@%c. September rang-ed
between 91 05% and 91 07 and closed at
91 oe?s. a net gain of l%o.
Strength in the cash grain and reports of
backward condition of the growing crop were
the main factors ' that held the corn, market
firm at a fair advance. December opened
%@%<s to %c higher, at 51%@51%o, sold up
to 62c and closed at 51%e. . - .-
Oats were firm as a result mainly of the
action of corn. ' - Â¦
Trading was, hsrht. After opening unchanged
to %c higher, at 32%o to 33c, September
ranged * at 32%{?-33%c to 3394c and closed at
33Â»ic. â¢ ' -. .
Indications of more serious complications in
the strike* situation' caused free selling of all
products, resulting in a weak provision market.
The close showed October pork at a loss of. 27%
Â©30c, lard down 12%c and ribs off 7%c.

The Bar y Association by a very. slight

ferred .to the Supreme Court.. President

ing/ William Denmari' and Philip Gal
nin to draw up the formal accusation.
"' Galpin states that the committee of
three appointed by Attorney Goodfel
low prepared the charges. *. Attorney
Denman, one of the committee, assert-
The charges against Attorney George
D.' Collins have at last been presented
to 'the Supreme! Court., Chief Justice
Beatty Has] the .brief 'in his possession,
and the Associate . Justices hax'e- been
notified to cohsider^the- accusation. Col
lins presented his reply to the charges
four months ago, or as soon as he
learned that [ he -was to be v put under
fire. . ..... .
Secrecy has been thrown about ,the
matter by, all concerned, .ahd.the fate
ful document containing the charges
is guarded with jealous cafe. 1
One of the .committee, of three ap
pointed to .prepare the., accusation ad
mitted last, night that he had not re
ceived a copy of^the brief. The paper
was npt;filed with Chief Deputy Clerk
Tolle, as 1 is 'customary in all official
proceedings, nor was Secretary Wash
burn" trusted .to inspect the document.
The chairman of the committee went
.directly to the' Chief Justice, and in the
desk of. that jurist the charges against
Rollins are resting.
- Beatty regretted greatly, .he
said, that he 'could not- make the ac
cusation public, but if the court should
decide to tak6 action he â¢ would place
all papers in the case on file. "The
other Judges," he s^tid, "will read the
brief, and if. they think Collins should
be made to answer an order to that
effect will be made. If the charges are
not deemed sufficient to warrant us in
.taking '.action the matter will never
come up "3n open court."
The" accused attorney states' that ,he
is prepared to give his opponents- "a
battle .rdyal." In addition to the an
swer xvhich he has already filed, he will
immediately prepare another. He : al
leges that he is persecuted and that he
can justify himself ;in all* of his profes
sional x acts!' Â° He Jiad made*iip his mind
that the charges would .twit be forth
coming. . .,,.,';. ' - Â¦ ' '-';.' i -
Philip Galpin, one of the three mem
bers of the Sari Francisco Bar Aeso
cfa'tion appointed by President William
Goodfellow to prepare the accusati6n,
stated last night that the charges pre
sented to the Supreme Court were prac
tically the 'same as.but more elaborate
than those' originally filed with the as
sociation'.' The principal charge against
Collins was that hs had made a false
affidavit to procure from the. Hibernia
Bank a sum of money to which he was
in no way. entitled. He is alleged to
have presented 7 a pa'gs ! book in the
name of 'AgnesNewinan requesting the
amount- due, which J was. about . $1200.
He showed an * assignment and said
that Agnes Newman had been his wife,
and that .she was clead. He is' alleged
to have then made an, affidavit in sup
port of his statements. ; It is charged in
this connect ion that he .was the hus
band of.Agr.es Newman's sister. Char
lotta, and that she at the time was liv
ing and undivorced. : ' ;
It is also alleged that Collins secured
iea~ye from the Superior Cdurt to sell
'certain pieces of real estate which -. he
knew had been bought in by the Hiber
nia Bank at a mortgage sale. This of
'fense is alleged to have been committed
during proceedings instituted ' by
Charles Robinson- against Charles Pur
rington.' administrator, of the estate of
mother. Caroline Robinson.
The Hibernia Bank subsequently had
the order of sale set aside. The third
charge is that Collins accused Superior
Judge Kerrigan of ineomnetency and
malfeasance in office, and that such ac
'utisations were untrue. / ' â¢ â¢ Â¦ ? â¢â¢â¢

11S1 Nintli a.venue.:
Because of ill luck as a contractor
and house builder on his own account,
Johnson had been despondent for sev
eral days. When he failed to appear
last Tuesday evening for his dinner'at
horns, .his wife became alarmed and,
as-fisied by two of Johnson's f fiends,
pruct^ded ' to search for him in thÂ»Â»
shrubbery near that part of the park.
His wife, between sobs and loud lam
entations, shrieked his name at al
most every s"tep. imploring him for
Sod'ii sake to come to her, but the
dead ears of the suicide were past all
hearin?, even of the potent voice of
love.
James Vint, who had been Johnson's
partner up to ' June *o. called at the
â¢Toroher's ofiice yesterday and made a
statement to the effect that the not*
ttttl by the suicide had done Vint
pneat injustice. Johnson, who was a
pood carpenter but a poor business

himsÂ«Â»lf- only a few months ago and be

While his distracted wife and two
anxious friends searched throush
Golden Gate Park for him last Tuesday
night, calling his name wherever the
shrubbery might hide a wounded man,
the dead body- of Arthur E.' Johnson
lay Ptark on .the sand glaring "with
glazed eyeballs at the moonlit sky.
The sound of his name from the lips
of a wife whom he dearly loved had
power no longer to stir him to a re
sponse, for there was a bullet in his
brain and clutched in his right hand
was a glittering revolver with which,
in a jnoment of melancholy, he had
ended his day?.

ed that he had not received a copy of
the accusation, but that he should like
to* get hold of one. .
Some six wetks ago your health officer be
gan a, systematic .examination of the cream
exposed for sale in the various dairy depots in
the city and county of San Francisco. A care
ful examination was conducted In the chemical
laboratory and the results were sensational In
the degree, but as the policy of the board is
ajrainst pallery play, a second examination
was made of the samples of cream purchased
at Â¦ forty- rlfrht different: depots.. The second
examination shows the result more striking
and BlarlnK- than the former. Thirty-three
samples out of the forty-elsrht submitted have
been shown to b- adulterated. The process. of
adulteration is this: Pure cream is reduced
by the addition -of water or probably a thin
skimmed mjlk and the deficit In the loss of
rollds. is made up by the addition of an arti
ficial protfid substance, which .upon -analysis
proves to b; sejatlne. There Is alro added a,
preservative, borax cr boracic acid, and in
sorts Instances a vegetable coloring matter de
rived' from carrots. '
Jlagan produced* in evidence some
samples of the "cream thickeners*'
which are manufactured by Eastern
and local concerns. One of thesamples
had a distinct odor of formaline. Cir
culars were also submitted containing
directionsâ "How to rrtakeÂ»a gallon of.
thick cream . out of milk and . cream"
and "How to' make a "gallon of thick
cream out of water and cream."
The Health Board ordered the names
of the alleged offenders to be posted
up on a. bulletin board in the main of
fice as a warning. Dr. Ward, president
of the board, referred to the 'wholesale
adulteration of cream as Iniquitous, and
said that warrants for the arrest of
those responsible ..would be sworn out
to-day. Ragan's report says:
The Board of Health' met yesterday
and on recommendation of Health Of
ficer Ragan ordered the owners of thir
ty-three dairy ; depots, -bakeries and
candy stores arrested on. the alleged
charge of "adulterating cream in- viola
tion of the State law.. -Ragran; filed a
voluminous report concerning- his in
vestigations, in that connection, which
was read by Deputy Health Officer
Louis Levy. .,-, . . .*V
The report stated that out of forty
eight samples of .cream taken from
