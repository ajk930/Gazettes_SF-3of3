The whole Irrigation plan is based 03
utilizing the White Nile for the benefit

Lord Cromer says that the carrying
out of the greater portion of the plan
may be postponed for the present, but
about $27,C0O,Gâ¬O should be utilized at
an early date in canals and for raisins

Referring to submarine boats Lord
Selbourne said their value for defensive
purposes had been abundantly proved.
They were a great addition to the na
tional strength. He did not believe
submarine boats had reached their llmt
of Improvement or usefulness. The les
sons from the war in the Far East
were the importance of the personnel,
the necessity for having a margin of
strength and the fact that without
battleships no power could hold nor
win command of the sea-
Lord Selbourne said the offer of Lord
Goschen, made when he was First Lord
of the Admiralty, that If other nations
would agree to diminish their rate of
ship building Great Britain would not
be slow to join the movement had not
been withdrawn, but the conditions
now were more complicated. A few
years ago It would have sufficed If
France and Great Britain had agreed
to diminish their shipbuilding, but now
there were almost half a dozen great
naval powers, and Great Britain and
France must consider the expenditure
of other powers. The two-power stand
was convenient as regards battleships,
but had never had Its application to
cruisers or torpedo-boats.
Continuing Lord Selbourne referred
to the newspaper comparison of the
gunnery and strength of the German
vessels which recently had visited Eng
land and pointed out that the German
ships carried eighteen 6-Inch guns com
pared with twelve on the ships of the
British channel squadron. But the
British ships carried 10-Inch, 12-Inch
and 13%-Inch guns, while there was
not a single gun on the German visit-
Ing fleet with a caliber over 9. 4-inch.
LONDON. Aug. 9.â Replying to criti
cisms of the naval expenditure in the
House of Lords to-day Lord Selbourne,
First Lord of the Admiralty, warmly
defended the outlay. He said it was
more important now than ever before
that British battleships especially
should be of the largest and best type.

All the newspapers to-day express
j great relief over the reports from
! Port Arthur. The army organ says
j thi-l although General Stoessel's re
1 port gives no details, It Is evident that
{ the Japanese have suffered a severe
reverse. The paper also pays a tribute
to the navy's share in the defense of
j the besieged fortress. Reviewing Gen-
I eral Kuropatkin's movements. It con
j tinues:
"Retreat is in accordance with a
j plan laid down for the first period of
I the campaign, which is to weaken the
j forces of the enemy by continuing
! strongly, the defensive portions, thus
! impeding the Japanese progress and
compelling the enemy to waste large
numbers of men and much war ma
terial on the advances. The result
has been that, in three and one-half
months, the Japanese have covered
1 only a few score of versts."
J5T, PETERSBURG. Aug. 9 C â Al*
"At 4 o'clock in the morning of
July 20 about five divisions of Jap
anese took the offensive against our

of the enormous superiority of the
enemy's forces and the weakness of
the position our troops were ordered
to retire to the next positions without
fighting. The movement was effected
In complete order, under the protec
j tion of artillery, which, by aefcurate
fire at short range, completely stopped
the Japanese advance.
"Our losses have not yet been ascer
tained, but they were not great. The
losses of the Japanese were very con
siderable. In the engagements of July
26 and 27 the Japanese had about 70,
000 men and a considerable number
of siege guns.

General Stoessel locates Yupilaza
Mountain as situated ten miles north
east of Port Arthur, and says that the
Japanese attack on that position was
only a demonstration, the real assault
of the Japanese being made on Russian
I-ositions on Wolf Hill, whi<A. he
points out, is only six miles northward
and near the railroad station. General
Stoessel's report follows:
"At 5 In the morning of July 27 the
enemy having advanced a strong force,
their artillery opened fire along their
whole front, followed by a series of at
tacks, one of which, directed against
Yupilaza Mountain, was especially vig
crous.
OXLY SIX MDLES FROM CITY.
ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 9.â A dis
patch received from Lieutenant
General Stoessel, commander of the
Russian military forces at Port Arthur,
confirms previous reports that the Jap
anese before Port Arthur are In pos
session of Wolf HllL The general says
that en July 30 the Russians withdrew
from their positions on Wolf Hill be
fore the numerical superiority of the
Japanese. General Stoessel estimates
the number of Japanese attacking Port
Arthur at 70,000.-
CHEFU, Ang. 9.â The officers of the
German cruiser Fuerst Bismarck, lying
at the outer edge of this harbor,
express the opinion that the firing
beard last night was an en T
counter between detachments of the
belligerent warships, apparently twen
ty miles northwest of Chefu. From the
cruiser's advantageous position the
flashes preceding the detonations could
be seen.
The Japanese also are bringing
strong forces from Yinkow. A col
umn marching from Newchwang,
with the evident Intention of flanking
Liaoyang from the westward. Included
10,000 Chinese from the Island of For
mosa, who are Japanese subjects. The
Associated Press correspondent at
Liaoyang points out the alarming
character of this development and
fears that the example may prove con
tagious. If the local Chinese are in
duced to join the Japanese it will be
impossible to distinguish the Formo
san and Manchurian Chinese. This
revives the specter of Chinese em
broilment, with the more remote pos
sibility of foreign entanglements.
There is considerable anxiety re
garding the presence of General Yuan
Shi Kai, commander in chief of the
Chinese forces, and General Ma with
strong forces of troops in the north.
Should a convenient opportunity pre
sent itself they may be tempted to
overstep the bounds of neutrality.
Although it now seems Improbable
that anything can prevent a Japanese
attack on Liaoyang, one of the Asso
ciated Press correspondents, in view
of the heavy rains, says the elements
may again prove to be Russia's allies
Just as they did In 1312. The pros
pect of rains heavy enough to arrest
military operations is not likely, how
ever, as the time of the rainy season
is now past.
There Is an unconfirmed rumor that
Lieutenant General Unevitch Is hur
rying large forces to Mukden to re
inforce General Kuropatkin. Gen-ral
Unevitch's 'troops are stationed
around Vladivostok and it is doubtful
if they could arrive at, Liaoyang in
time.
though Lieutenant General Sakharoff
reports there is no change in the sit
uation around Liaoyang, it is evident
from the special dispatches from
Liaoyang and Sintsiniln that the Jap
anese are continuing" their prepara
tions for a flanking movement, which
may alter the nature of the expected
engagement at Liaoyang and which
may also further delay the crucial de
velopment.
The concentration of a strong Jap
anese force at Saimatsza indicates an
Intention to press forward toward
Mukden and. If possible, cut the com
munications and prevent General Ku
ropatkin retiring northward. General
Kuropatkin evidently is aware of this
move and is sending out reconnoiter
ing parties from Sintsintin, along the
Saimatsza road. This is shown by the
slight encounter with a Japanese out
post within thirty miles of Sintsintin.
Zangwill adds that he is going to do
everything in his power to have a com
mission sent out to make preliminary
arrangements for a Jewish colony In
British East Africa. He hopes to be
able to establish workshops there
which will supply the neighboring
States with goods.
Zanswill says Nordau was a close
friend of Dr. Herzl and shared the
great leader's . plans more than any
one else and is his logical successor.
"The movement is as yet too imma
ture to be run by a committee.** says
Zangwill. "There must be one man at
the head. He must be of magnetic
force rather than merely a gcod busi
ness man. Nordau possesses mag
netism, eloquence, energy and interna
tional reputation, and should be paid
enough to enable him to devote his
whole *time to the work.
"Herzl's efficiency was reduced by the
fact that his own interests compelled
him to stay in Vienna. The leader of
Zionism should be free to visit all
countries at his pleasure.
"The Zionist movement is the great
est ever undertaken by any race. Jews
have been forced to do without a
country for more than 2000 years and
have become part of all the nations of
the world. The task, though colossal,
is impossible only while the Jews are
not united."
LONDON. Aug. 9.â Israel Zangwill
will aay in to-morrow's Review of Re
views that Max Nordau is the proper
man to succeed Dr. Herzl as the leader
of Zionism.

It is impossible to ascertain the result of the operations.
Steamships that arrived here to-day, having passed close to the

DISTINGUISHED STATESMAN OF
MISSOURI WHO D1KD AT HOME
AT SWEET SPRINGS.
SWEET SPRINGS, Mo., Aug. 9.â
After lingering for weeks between life
and death, former Senator George Vest
passed peacefully away to-day. He
had been so near death for the past
three days that the end came without
a struggle. He was conscious until
about 2 o'clock Sunday morning, when
he sank into a state of coma from
which he never aroused. He lost the
power of speech Saturday morning, but
for several days before that he talked
very Imperfectly and during the last
thirty-six hours of his life his breath-
Ing was barely perceptible. The flutter
cf his pulse was all that showed that
life still remained.
At the bedside when the end came
was his wife; Dr. Jarvis, the family
physician; Senator Vest's son Alexan
der; his daughter, Mrs. George P.
Jackson, and her husband; and Mrs.
Thompson, a niece of Mrs. Vest.
The body was taken to St. Louis this
evening for interment.'
JEFFERSON CITY. Mo., Aug. 9.â
Governor Dockery to-day issued a
proclamation cm the death of former
Senator George Graham Vest, calling
for the suspension of public business
on Thursday, August 11, the day of the
funeral. It says: .'â¢;>*â¢
"Since the admission of Missouri to
the Union her sons have borne con
spicuous parts in the great controver
sies, but among them none haai
achieved greater distinction than, our
distinguished departed Senator. In
deed, it was more than distinction. He
rose tOi greatness."
The committee appointed- to attend
the funeral .of Senator Vest as repre
sentatives of the State is composed of
100 men prominent in all walks of life.
KANSAS CITY. Aug. 9.â A mob of
tOO men and boys, packing-house strik
ers and their sympathizers, stopped an
incoming train carrying strike-break
ers at Riverside, Kans., to-night, drove
the non-union men from the train with
clubs, threw their baggage into the
Kaw River and set fire to the car. The
police extinguished the fire before any
damage had been done. No arrests
vere made.
The mob made a rush for the train
â¢uhile it was running slowly over the
Fuburban Belt Line tracks toward the
Schwarzchild & Sulzberger plant, the
declination of the strike-breakers. As
th'e members of the mob climbed
on the train they subdued the train
men and set the brakes of the fifteen
freight cars, bringing them to a stand
still.
The strike-breakers fled in terror,
fr<tme of them being chased for blocks,
but all escaped injury. After the es
cape of -the non-union men the mob
dumped their baggage into the river
end set fire to the cars.
In the meantime a riot call had been
turned in and a detail of police hurried
to the scene. Upon the arrival of the
police the mob scattered. In all there
were about seventy-five strike-break
ers, who are supposed to have been
brought in from Northern Kansas.

The San Francisco Police -Depart
ment will have a new office if the rec
ommendations made to the Police Com
missioners last evening are carried
out. The new position is that of Police
Inspector, to rank between ; the cap
tains and the Chief. "Chief Wittman
made the recommendation, asking for
one inspector: to every BOO patrolmen.
This would ;mean "two inspectors â¢ at
present. The Chief also advanced a
new schedule of pay ror patrolmen. ';
It wasÂ«-an evening of surprises. Com
missioner Hutton rose while the Chief's
recommendations were being discussed
and said that he would advocate the
appointment of Police Judges hy a ma
jority vote of the Superior Judges. On
being asked his reason for proposing
this startling change, Hutton replied,
"To keep the police courts out of poli
tics."
, Chief ' Wittman's proposed change
of salary will not affect policemen al
ready on the force. It divides patrol
men Into three classes â first, those
who have served five years or more,
to receive 5100 a month; second, those
who have served between three and
five years, to receive $95; third, those
who have served less than three years,
to receive 590.
The Chief also proposed that re
cruits for the police force be between
25 and 30 years of age and able to
pass the physical examination of the
regular army.
The proposed schedule of salaries
for the police is as follows:
Inspectors, $3300 Â¦ per annum; cap
tains, $2400; lieutenants, $1920 (raised
from $140 per month); sergeants,
$1500, and corporals, $1400. The
Chief maintains that as lieutenants
are often forced to do captains' work,
their pay should be increased.
The proposed changes will be fully
discussed at the next meeting of the
board. They are favored by its mem
bers excepting as to a few details.
Hutton wants the age limits 21-30'
years. Reagan advocates the mini
mum for third-class patrolmen to be
$100 a month and to increase from
that sum in the ratio proposed by the
Chief.
Policeman Thomas H. Dowd was
found guilty of drunkenness, neglect of
duty and making an IHegal arrest.
Hutton and Howell voted for dismissal,
Reagan for $100 fine on each charge and
Drinkhouse for $50 fines. The matter
will be taken up at the next meeting.
Patrolman Vincent B. Lewis was repri
manded for failure to report for duty.

The packers assert that fully 80 per
,cent of the usual amount of work was
carried on to-day. The receipts of
livestock, while not large, still were al
most normal compared with corre
sponding days before the strike began.
The greater portion of these arrivals
vere purchased by the packers, and
before night had been slaughtered.
Between 600 and 700 new arrivals
vere added to the packers' force of em
ployes to-day.
' CHICAGO. Aug. 9.â An attempt to

United States Regards Sinking of
Prize Vessel as Permissible.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 9.â The fact
that so far no proof has been pro
duced before the State Department to
show American ownership of a sin
gle pound of the cargo of the Knight
Commander, the British vessel sunk
by the Vladivostok squadron, has
tended to diminish the Interest here in
the financial side of that affair. But
much interest is manifested in the in
ternational question now under dis
cussion between Russia and Great
Britain as to the right of a belligerent
to sink a neutral ship, even with con
traband of war aboard, instead of tak
ing her before a prize courts
According to officials here, the
United States is so placed geographi
cally that in the event of a war with
a European power it might be necessary
for our warships to take the Russian
view of this matter â of the right to
sink â else any Idea of taking prizes or
inflicting damage upon the enemy by
attacking its merchant shipping must
be abandoned, for it is stated to be im
possible to bring a prize across the
Atlantic with its own coal.
However, the State Department has
not committed itself in this matter,
but is watching developments in the
negotiations between St. Petersburg
and London.

LONDON, Aug. 9.â Absolute accord

Great Uritain In respect to the .rights
of neutral commerce, and when the
declaration of Secretary Hay was pub
lished yesterday the State Department
v/us informed that it was in entire ac

In order that Russia might understand
the similarity of the British and Amer

the British Embassador in St. Peters

definition of contraband along the same
lines as the declaration transmitted
through Embassador McCormick.
Great Britain would like the United
States to take steps to obtain an in

rights of neutrals, but it Is not believed
at the Foreign Office that Secretary
Hay will do so, it being understood
that he proposes to retain complete lib
erty of action.

They tried to retreat, but were almost
annihilated by the Russian battery
which had shelled in the rear. A few
of the Japanese succeeded in ascend

The Russians expected that the Ja

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 9.â A dis

the Japanese pressed the Russian rear
from Simoucheng, but did not remain
in touch with it. * Just south of Simou
lln the road winds through a valley
admirably suited for an ambuscade.
The Russians, with one battalion and
two guns, . occupied the hills on one
side and placed six guns, carefully
masked, on the road in the valley. A
regiment of Japanese, in close order,
hurried into the vallev and passed be
neath the guns concealed on the
heights. Then the guns in the road
ahead opened and mowed* the ranks of
the Japanese, who stood, for some time,
apparently dazed, and then broke and
ran.

a number of other persons seriously in
jured in a collision to-night between a
westbound Baltimore and Ohio local
passenger train and a Chicago and Erie
freight train at the Brighton Park rail
road crossing at Western. avenue and
West Thirty-ninth street. The collision
followed a frantic effort on the part of
the crossing flagman to change the
j course of the freight train, to the crew
I of which he had given a signal that all
; was clear for the train to back over the
: Baltimore and Ohio tracks. f. V
The passenger train, which was ap- '
proaching rapidly, was struck by the
-freight cars and two of the coaches
! were overturned. One of the freight
' cars" crashed through the woodwork of
one of the coaches where the four
who were killed were seated. They were
â¢a family of five, and C. C. Schwartz, the
.father, was the only one who escaped
with his life. Although taken from the I
wreck unconscious and suffering from

his injuries will not prove fatal. The
mother and the three children were
killed instantly. The dead:

TABLE SHOWING VOTE
CAST BY REPUBLICANS
THROUGHOUT THE CITY
dolph was a bitter one for a party pri
mary in which there waa hardly an
other contest. Behind Mitchell lined
up Guy C. Earl, university regent;
Charles E. Snook, attorney for the re
gents; Charles H. Spear; State Harbor
Commissioner; Arthur H. Breed, City
Auditor; Mortimer Smith, Police Judge,
and H. B. Mehrmann, Coroner; Frank
W. Leavitt, State Senator, George W.
Reed and others. Behind Randolph
stood J. Cal Ewing, secretary of the
State Bank Commission; Frank C. Jor
dan, clerk of the Supreme Court; J. P.
Cook, County Clerk; George Pierce
Chief Deputy County Clerk; Thomas
M. Robinson, Chief Deputy County As
sessor, and others. There was even an
effort made to drag Governor George
C. Pardee into the fight, but the Gov
ernor quietly came to .town last Sat
urday night and left town on Sunday
night and did not get into the scrap.
The^ contest to-day was centered in
the Fiftieth Assembly District. To this
section twenty-six delegates had been
apportioned and the f two candidates
went to it with a will and with a gen
eral understanding that the man who
got these delegates would win the rest
of the district. In this section the only
big vote of the county was polled, and
to-night the figures for these twenty
six delegates stood: -Mitchell delegates,
654; Randolph delegates, 529; Mitchell's
majority, 125. :r'h : , ;; J ,
The Assembly fight in the Forty
ninth District was very closeâ so close,
in fact, that in one precinct the vote
was a tie and the delegation will 'be
split between the two candidates, if it
should come to a contest in the conven
tion. Flynn carried his home precincts
by very large votes, but *Burke was
able "to carry the precincts that have
the larger number of delegates. Burke
gets six delegates in the Second Ward,
five delegates in the Fourth and four
in the Sixth. . Flynn gets nine delegates
In the Third Ward, while* the two are
tied for eight delegates in : the Fourth
Ward, which would divide this delega
tion, making nineteen votes for Burke
and thirteen for Flynn. The ticket in
this Assembly > .District was' not a
blanket one, the delegates being ap
portioned among the different voting
precincts.
The only other Republican contest
was in Alameda, where the fight was be

in the Thirty-second, and were a po

The blunder of an election clerk in
Precinct 109, Forty-fourth District, at
Pine and Kearny streets, prevented the
tally of the official vote there and may
have its effect on the McNab forces. It
is also likely to affect the Congressional
fight in the Fourth District.
The tally clerk made his 'mistake af

BALLOT CLERK'S ERROR
TIES UP THE RETURNS
IN THE FORTY-FOURTH
Joseph P. Hayes, who represented
tht? 'regular Democrats in the Forty
third, drove a young man out of the
booth at 629 -Post street who tried to
"repeat" under the name of John Den
nis O'Brien. O'Brien is out of the city.
Police Sergeant' Williams captured the
young man, but as no one appeared. to
prefer a charge against him he was
freed. Hayes said that during the day
the following names were "â¢ Illegally
voted by "stuffers": George Knapp of

lives on Bush street; P. Walsh, whose
HIGH-HANDED PROCEEDINGS.
' A complaint also reached the Regis
trar's office that affairs were being
conducted In a high-handed manner in
general precinct No. 107, on the north
Bide of Jackson street, near Leaven
worth. It was charged that tickets
were being peddled in the booths in
violation of the 100-foot law and that
the police officers in attendance were
doing nothing to stop the illegal prac
tice. Word was sent from the regis
tration office to the complainant that
he should call on the police officers to
do their duty and in the event of their
refusal report the matter to the Chief
of Police.
These developments were soon noised
throughout the district and were gen
erally charged to rounders working in
the interest of the "Horses and Carts,"
who reorganized for the campaign un
der the title of the Democratic League.
The fact of the commission of the
fraud was communicated to the head
quarters of the regular Democratic or
ganization â the McNab wing â and an
Investigation was instituted. A list of
the names of all those that appeared
as having voted was taken by the reg
ular Democrats, They say they will
interview every person whose signa
ture appears, that they may get all the
evidence possible to further their ef
forts to land the offenders in the peni
tentiary.
Charges were also freely made
throughout the Thirty-eighth District
that heelers were getting 510 each ror
aiding in the effort to stuff the ballot
boxes. It waSjClaimed by'some that
they saw money paid to the "stuffers,"
but as to names and persons they were
bo hazy that their testimony would be
of little Importance In a criminal pro
ceeding. V
Several complaints were also re
celved'in the Registrar's office during
the day from citizens in the Forty
third Assembly District that when they
reached the polling places and desired
to vote they were informed that their
names had already been voted. Reg
istrar Adams issued an order that any
man whose name, had been voted and
who was willing to swear in his vote
would be allowed to exercise his fran
chise. â¢/â¢>-it v '
They demanded, however, that they
be allowed to vote, and their ballots
were sworn in. Following Riddell and

that the heelers had also voted his
name. His protest was recorded and
he was allowed to swear In his vote.
precinct opened, It was Invaded by a
gang of heelers. The majority of them
called fcr Democratic ballots, signed
the book, voted and slipped away.
Things went along merrily, no one sus
pecting that fraud was being commit
ted, until two hard-looking citizens en
tered the booth, and, after calling for
ballots, announced, one thai his name
was William Pugh, the other that he
was Joseph Kane. J. J. Golden, elec
tion officer, looked up from his work In
surprise. He is acquainted with Pugh
and knows his voice. The voter was
not Pugh.
"You can't vote for that man," Eaid
Golden. "I know Mr. Pugh."
The crook ran his pen through the
name he had signed and bolted for the
door. The man that announced he was
Kane followed on a run. Police were,
summoned, but the "stuff ers" managed
to elude them and make their escape.
The election officers then sat up and
began to take - notice." It was their
opinion that 1 the discomfiture of the
man who attempted to vote Pugh's
name had prevented the consummation
of the only fraud attempted. But they
were In error. In a short time Dewltt
S. Riddell and Howard M. Ladd, Re
publicans, both brothers-in-law of Phil

for ballots. An examination of the

had been voted by the "stutters."

missioner Lefllngwell was notified and
when he arrived on the. scene he dis
covered the tally sheet to be muddled
so badly that it would be Impossible to
strike a total from the precinct.
Leffingwell ordered the ballot boxes
sealed up; but the tally clerk objected
and refused to allow the Election Com
missioner to interfere. It looked like a
serious riot for a few moments, but
three policemen finally arrived on the
scene and forcibly took the ballot boxes
away frdm the clerk.
They were sealed up and sent to the
headquarters of the Election Commis
sioners. The vote will . be officially
counted before that body this after

The contest in the' Democratic ranks
yesterday was marred by repeating and
fraudulent voting. Money was used to
corrupt voters. According to the gen-
Gavin McNab, leader of the regular
or county committee forces of the Dem
ocratic party won a victory at the
primary election yesterday over James
H. O'Brien, commander of the Demo
cratic League. Owing to some con
fusion in the returns of the Forty
fourth Assembly District the actual re
sult may not be . declared until this

is complete and decisive. . . . s ,

Nab will not' amount to much In the
State convention of the party. The
chief concern of the O'Brien-Hearst
forces centered around the local con
vention. The Democratic vote of 7238
was not as heavy as the party leaders
expected. '
According to the semi-official \ re
turns revised at a late hour with the
returns in Precinct 109, Ferty-fourth
District lacking, the regular Democrats
appear to have elected 102 delegates to
the State and- district conventions and
105V6 to the local convention. The Dem

A smack of the good old crooked
days added interest and some excite
ment to the primary election yester
day. Though charges of "stuffing"
could be heard in a majority of the
districts, it is not known positively that
any criminal scheme was consummat
ed except in the Seventy-second Pre
cinct of the Thirty-eighth District In
many other precincts there is fairly
good evidence that Illegal votes were
cast. t
The delegates elected to the county
conventions will met in this city, the
Republicans on August 10 and the
Democrats on September 5. Each
county convention will nominate As
semblymen from the Seventh-ninth and
Eightieth districts and Supervisors
from the First. Second and Third dis
tricts. In the Seventy-ninth Assembly-
District Republicans will probably re
nominatp F. W. Bardes of Pacific
Beach, while the Democrats may direct
their votes to the nomination of Pat
terson Spragg. In the Eightieth Dis
trict It seems likely that Percy A. John
son of Fall Brook will be named by th>
Republicans, while the Democrats hava
given no indication of who may be their
candidate.
The Republican delegates elected to
the county convention are opposed to
instruction for any candidate for United
States Senator. Delegates to the StatÂ«
convention are also noncommittal a3
to their preference for Senator.
Democratic delegates elected to the
State and Congressional conventions
are: George M. McKinzie, George J.
Magly, Will Parker. Herman Marks.
W. H. Holcomb, I. Isaac Irwin, Sam
Schiller, from the city, and D. D. Law

county. They are, or will be, for Wil
liam M. Smythe of this city for Con
gress.
SAN DIEGO, Aug. 9.â The primary
election was held throughout this city
to-day under the State law. A similar
election was held by the Democrats
throughout the Eightieth Assembly-
District, which is the county outside
the city, and caucuses were held by the
Republicans throughout the country
precincts.

WARD HEELERS VOTE
ILLEGALLY IN MANY
OF THE DISTRICTS
There was no contest over delegates
to the Republican State Convention,
and the delegates from this district
will vote for former Senator Robert N.
Bulla for Presidential elector. No con
test occurred in the Congressional race,
and Congressman McLachlan is certain
to be returned, possibly without oppo
sition, for the Democrats are practi
cally unorganized. In many precincts
to-day not a Democratic ticket was
voted, and in others known Democratic
leaders were openly assisting the Flint
forces. Los Angeles County elects no
county officers this year except two
members of the Board of Supervisors,
and in both districts the Incumbents
will be returned.
In the Thirty-seventh Assemblyman
E. W. Camp of Sierra Madre appears
to have the advantage over former As
semblyman H. A. Broughton of Po
mona, but both have declared for Bard.
Henry E. Carter, Speaker pro tern, of
the last Assembly, has won out ovpr
Senator Fred M. Smith and A. W. Gra
ham. Carter will vote for Flint. AH
the holdover Senators, Hahn, Savage
and Pendleton, have declared for Flint
In the city districts, from Seventy
one to Seventy-five, inclusive, the As
semblymen are practically certain to
be as follows, In the order named: P.
A. Stanton, H. G. S. McCartney, J. P.
Transue, Fred Houser (all members of
the last Assembly), and J. H. Krim
minger, a new member, all of whom
are Flint supporters, or are so slated.
Two Los Angeles districts elect State
Senators this year.
TWO STATE SENATORS.
In the Seventieth District /.ssembly
man W. H. Kelso of Inglewool, a Bard
supporter, is leading, but the result
will be close.
In the Sixty-eighth district Assembly
man W. A. Johnstone of San Dimas,
another Bard man, had no opposition.
In the Sixty-ninth, C. J. Walker of
Long Beach, who favors Bard, appears
to be in the lead, but as his opponent
is al3O a Bard man the result will be
the same so far as the Senatorial vote
is concerned.
The Bard managers made the mis
take of failing to put up' tickets in a
number of the precincts, and at such
places the Flint supporters cast their
ballots and then went into doubtful
districts and helped the other Flint
men where they were most needed. A
tremendous vote was polled, considering
the fact that this was only a primary
election, but then it really settled all
the contests for offices, because Los An
geles County is hopelessly lost to the
Democrats, and they know it. â¢
In the Pasadena district, the Sixty
seventh, Assemblyman A. Goodrich
will be renominated. He is for Bard.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 9.â In a pri
mary in which, on the Republican side,
there was as strenuous a fight as was
ever waged between the great parties,
Los Angeles city declared overwhelm
ingly in favor of Frank P. Flint for
United States Senator. . The country
precincts gave Senator Bard their sup
port. The result will be that the mem
bers of the Legislature from the dis
tricts wholly outside of the cities will
cast Bard votes, and the other mem
bers of the Los Angeles County dele
gation will support Flint This means
that Flint will have' a decided majority
in the Los Angeles delegation, the pres
ent indications being that It will ten
for Flint to four for Bard. It la pos
sible that the flgures may be nine to
five.
That Is what the Flint men are claim
ing, . but the Bard men do not admit
that Flint will have more than five of
the fourteen Los Angeles County votes,
and they assert that they can more
than overcome the advantage held by
Flint In this county, by what they ex
pect to get in the other counties of this
end of the State.
Certain it is that Flint will control
the coming county convention by a ma
jority which may exceed 200 and may
go even higher. From the opening of
the polls until they closed there was a
scramble for votes, and in this strug
gle the magnificent organization of the
Flint forces counted.

REPUBLICAN DELEGATES
WHO WERE ELECTED TO
THE TWO CONVENTIONS
The Republican vote throughout the
city was 9010. This, while larger than
that cast by the Union Labor and
Democratic parties combined, fell a lit
tte below the expectations.
It is indicated by the election that
K. I. Wolfe. Twenty-first District;
George B. Keane, Twenty-third; Phil
J. Haskins. Twenty-fourth, and J. H.
Nelson, Twenty-fifth District, will be
nominated for the State Senate.
The primary election In San Fran
cisco yesterday resulted in a victory
for the regular Republican organiza
tion in all Assembly districts other
than the Thirty-fifth and Thirty-sixth.
The success of the Eggers delegates
over the regulars in the Thirty-sixth
signifies the nomination of John Mul-
Jer for the Assembly. There was a
olbse fluht in the Thlftv-second Dis
trict, resulting in a tie vote between
II. J. Welch, leader of the opposition,
and his opponent on the regular ticket
for delegate to the State Convention.
The Thirty-fifth District, which, along
with the Thirty-second, constitutes the
Nineteenth Senatorial District, went
agr&inst the organization, but It is as
parted at party headquarters that *he
result in the Thirty-fifth does not sig
nify the nomination of Welch for the
State Senate. .

places they have been making a spirit
ed fight, especially to secure the dele
gates In the Third Supervlaional Dis
trict, which now Is represented by
Fred M. Stern, who haa" been seeking
renomlnatlon.
There was an opposition ticket In but
few of the county districts and most of
these delegates are favorable to Hayes.
There was but a feeble contest among
the Democrats in all wards but tha
First. An opposition was put-up by
T. C. Hogan and others to the regular
Democratic ticket. Hogan carried his
own ward, the First, but In the other
wards the regular Democratic ticket
won.

AT PRIMARIES HELD TO SELECT DELEGATES TO STATE AND LOCAL CONVENTIONS
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 10, 1904.
The San Diego legislative delegation of three will go unpledged. The contest may become so
close in the south that San Diego will hold the balance of power. The victory of Muenter over Dun
lap in San Joaquin is favorable to Oxnard. Fresno County's Senator and two Assemblymen will
support" Bard. B. F. Rush wins out over Frank Devlin in Solano County. The success of the Hayes
forces in Santa Clara is regarded as favorable to Bard or Oxnard. The machine forces, which met
defeat, were openly, against Bard. In the. Eighth District there is a close contest between S. C.
Smith of Kern and -M. L. Ward of San Diego for the Republican Congressional nomination.
In Los Xngeles County, where the contest for United States Senator was the chief feature,
Bard won five Assemblymen and Frank Flint won five Assemblymen and one Senator. Three hold
over Senators, Hahn, Savage and Pendleton, are for Flint, which makes the Los Angeles delegation
stand : Flint, 9 ; Bard, 5. ..
~T~HE aggregate vote cast at. th^primary election in San Francisco yesterday was 17,914, of which

"When the Hawaiian Government
last year surrendered to the United
States its interest and property in the
lighthouses of the islands it was hoped
by navigators that a speedy improve
ment would be made in the all but
useless system. Of the twenty-two
lights, it has been found that only
two, the Diamond Head light and the
one at Barbers Point, both on the isl
and of Oahu, located on property
actually owned by the Government,
are in towers that were either sub
stantial or adequate to the purposes
designed. All of the rest are on pri
vate property or property in dispute
and as such possession has been de
nied to the representatives of the
United States, who are at a standstill
and prevented from bringing the ser
vice up to the standard desired and
expected. Of the twenty lights, exclu
sive of the two fairly effective ones on
Oahu, none is even fairly well equip
ped.
Lieutenant Commander Xiblack ot
the United States navy, who Is deputy
to the lighthouse inspector of the
Twelfth District, reports discouraging
conditions existing and no improve
ment is possible until the property
rights of the United States Govern
ment have been decided. This means
delay, and in the meantime naviga
tors are loud in their complaints.
Lieutenant Niblack has reported ex
haustively on the needs of the islands,
but is unable to carry out any im
provements, let alone the construction
of new lights, until Congress appropri
ates sufficient for the purpose. An
appropriation of $250,000 will ba
asked of Congress at its next session
to construct lighthouses and thor
oughly renovate the lights.

HAWAII IS IN NEED
OF NEW MGHTHOrSES
Charged with gross neglect and with
withholding $40,000 in bonds and other
securities, Alonzo H. Stewart, assist
ant sergeant-at-arms of thÂ» United
States Senate, and ona of the best
known men in this country, is
preparing to cut short his vacation in
California to hurry East and face the
accusations made by his wife. Stew
art has been a guest at the Palace Ho
tel for several days. Yesterday he was
apprised of the fact that his wife. Grace
Bliss Stewart, had Instituted proceed
ings in Atchlson. Kans., their home,
for a divorce, and the husband imme
diately placed himself In communica
tion with former United States Sena
tor John M. Thurston of Nebraska re
garding the case.
In her complaint the aggrieved wife
sets forth that she was married to
Stewart In Atchlson on July 10, 1901,
and that thev have not lived together
for more than a year. The charge is
also made by the wife that her hus
band appropriated to his own usa
bonds and securities valued at $40,000
which belonged to her mother, Mrs.
J. L. Bliss, and her aunt, Mrs. N. K.
Dunham, both of whom are residents
of Atchison. It is also alleged in tha
complaint that these securities wera
obtained by Stewart before his mar
riage, but that Mrs. Stewart did not
learn of the fact until after she had
become his wife.
"When interviewed yesterday regard
ing the suit. Stewart at first denied all
knowledge of it. but finallv acknowl
edged that he had been expecting It.
He declined to discuss the matter
further and referred his interviewer
to ex-Senator Thurston, who, he said,
had full charge of hi3 side of the case.
The Stewart wedding* was a social
event in Atchison in 1901. After the
ceremony the groom chartered a
special train to carry the bridal party
to St. Joseph. Mo., whence It journeyed
to Kansas City in a special train pro
vided by Senator Thurston. Stewart's
official connections at Washington re
sulted In his bride receiving many
valuable presents from statesmen and
other notable men with whom her
husband was acquainted.
Stewart, according to his friends in
this city, has been expecting that his
wife would bring a suit and he was
prepared for it. He has been on the
coast for some time and during his
stay in this city he devoted consider
able time to seeing that the Senators
and Congressmen who came here last
week to Investigate merchant marine
conditions enjoyed themselves during
their leisure hours.

centers in late years have had their

General MacArthur, accompanied by
his aids, Major West and Captain
Winn, with Captain Hartmann of the
Signal Corps, started out early this
evening in two automobiles and made
a detour of the country over which the
maneuvers are to take place. It was
late this afternoon before General Mac-
Arthur returned. As he came into his
camp the band struck up "The Star-
Spangled Banner," and instantly every
cap was doffed.
The following Federal officers and
enlisted men are in camp: General
MacArthur and his aids. Major West
and Captain Winn; Colonel Jocelyn,
Colonel Andrews, Colonel Girard, Colo

country stopped at the camp of the
provisional regiment, where he was re
ceived by Colonel Pitcher and the* offi
cers of that regiment.
A postc/ffiee has been established here
and the address is Camp Atascadero.
All the roadsjn the immediate vicinity
of the camp have been either oiled or
covered with straw so that the dust is
practically laid. The new signal ser
vice automobile has proved a success.
It made the trip from San Francisco
here with flying colors and met the re
quirements so far as speed and dura
bility are concerned. The mess of the
officers of the provisional regiment,
under the supervision of Captain Jerry
Lynch, is destined to prove one of the
big features of camp life here. Under
his supervision a long marquee tent
has been erected and lighted with Jap
anese. lanterns. This will undoubtedly
prove to be one of the most popular
rendezvous in the . camp for : the offi

The Fifteenth Infantry arrived last
night. The provisional regiment, Col
onel W. L. Pitcher, arrived this morn
ing at dawn. At 10 o'clock the tents
were pitched and the camp at noon
was in working order to the most mi

The recent summer school enrolled
1026 students and cost the university
only $364.
The university will spend this year
$102.S05 on agriculture, mechanics and
military science. This is $19,935 more
than its income for those purposes.
Lart year's enrollment at the Wil
roerdlng school was 140. twenty-five
nmre than the previous year, and the
total expense of maintaining the insti
tution was $27,000.
The board decided to appropriate
$13,000 for the construction of two roads

Dr. M. Hertzstefn has offered to give
$500 to provide for lectures, to be de
livered in Berkeley, on some subject
fundamental to medicine, and Dr.
Alonzo E. Taylor, profepor of pathology
in the university, has been selected as
the lecturer.
"Mr. Spreckels provides the German
â¢d^partmÂ«?nt of the State University,
which has been sorely hampered by the
inadequacy of its library, with an
equipment which cannot fail to give a
powerful impetus to advanced study in
the Germanic languages and litera
tures, not only at Berkeley, but in con
junction with the Hildebrand library
â¢at Stanford and on the Pacific Coast
generally."
â¢ Considerable time was consumed in
discussion of the finance committee's
recommendation that the board of re
ffents appoint a committee of three to
reorganize the financial system of the
medical department of the university
with a view to taking it under actual
control of the board. The committee's
'report was adopted.
The library purchased with Mr.
Fpreckels' donation. President Wheeler
explained, is that of the late Professor
Karl Weinhold of the University '" of
Berlin, who was one of the most dis
tinguished scholars of the last half
century. During his career of sixty
years as professor of Germanic phil
ology he collected a thorough working
library of about 10,000 volumes and
3 amphlets which covers effectively the
entire range of Germanistic studies â
'Ihe modern classics, literary criticism
ar.d the history of literature. "By this
splendid gift." said President Wheeler.
v.pre Britton. Budd, Dohrmann, Foster,
McEnerney, Yorke, Wheeler and Rein
ftein. President Wheeler of the uni
versity and Attorney C. A. Snook, the
board's legal adviser, were also there.
President Wheeler's report acknowl
edged several valuable gifts to the uni
versity. It stated that Mrs. Hearst will
five about $20,000 for maintenance of
the department of anthropology dur
ing the year 1904-05; that John D.
Spreckels has given $70!X> to enable the
university to come into possession of
one of the finest and most complete pri
vate Germanistic libraries in the world;
that William H. Crocker has offered to
defray the expense, $7000, of sending
expeditions from the Lick Observatory
to .Egypt, Labrador and Spain to ob
serve the total ecliDse of the sun next
August; that a number of friends of
the Lick Observatory have given a to
tal of $2050 to help pay the cost of
publishing a volume of that institu
tion's observations of the nebulae and
ftar clusters inaugurated by Director
Keeler, and that several smaller bene
factions have been received.
". After an hour's deliberation behind

committee thirty days more to wrestle

A. L. Whitney Has evidently had
hard luck with the trains of 'the
Southern ' Pacific Company, judging
from the complaints In two suit* filed
against the corporation yestcrdav in
the Justices' Court. The fL'SS com
plaint alleges that a train at Bores
ford, San Mateo County, run into a
horse belonging to Whitney on De
cember 11 last, killing the animal.
Whitney demands the sum of 5299 for
the loss of his horse.
The complaint in the second suit
recites that Whitney was opsrating an
automobile on August 17, 1903, and
while crossing the track near B'!res
ford his machine stalled, owin^ to the
gravel. Whitney noticed a trai :i
speeding down the track and realizln<
that he could not move his automobile
one way or the other, he ran down
the track and signaled the engineer to
stop. Whitney alleges that either the
engineer did -not see his frantic signs
or else maliciously disregarded them
and as a . result his automobile was
torn, twisted and- rendered valueless
by the impact of the engine. He says
he was obliged to spend $299 to re
pair the automobile and dem-ir.ds that
amount from the Southern Pacific
Company.
BIG BASIN EXCURSION
. ENROLLS LARGE PARTY
BERKELEY, Aug. 9.â Professor Wil
liam A. Setchell, head of the depart
ment of botany at the University of
CaJifornia, returned to the University
to-day after spending a year abroad in
travel and research work. In the
course of his travels Professor Setchell
visited all the great botanical gardens
of the world. Leaving California in
May last he went East, crossed over
into Europe, touched every continental
power, as well as England, and then
completed the circumnavigation* of the
globe via the. antipodes. Besides ad
ding much to his own store of knowl
edge, Professor Setchell was mindful
of the University's interest and Cali
fornia will be much the gainer throngh
his extensive visit on account of the
specimens of plant life that he has col
lected.
â¢'On my way East," said Professor
Setchell to-day at the Faculty Club, "I
visited the botanical departments of
most of the universities and had a
good chance to compare their methods
with ours. I also visited the botanical
gardens In Dublin, London, Sweden,
Holland, St. Petersburg, India, the
Dutch East Indies and Australia. In all
these places I found that considerable
research work is being done, some of
which -concerned the problem of life
origin, such as Professor Hugo de Vries
of the University of Amsterdam Is in
terested in. They devote a great deal
of time to botanical science in Holland
and Sweden and the gardens there are
extensive.
The time I gave to study and re
search work was necessarily limited on
account of my extensive itinerary,
though I was enabled to gather some
new ideas from association with the
botanists of Europe. I spent a large
part of my time* at Trinity College in
Dublin and at St. Petersburg. At Trin
ity College I was able to- gather a col
lection of sea weed, such as are found
in the collections there, and these will
be valuable for study and classification
here. In fact I gathered materials at
nearly every place I visited, so that the
botany department will be benefited In
at least one way by my trip."
Professor Setchell will resume his
place as head of the department -of
botany when the regular University
session opens this month.

Hjo Central and the Farmers' and

to Take It.
OAKLAND. Aug. 9. â The Central
end the Farmers' and Merchants'
â¢ banks of this city no longer want the
money deposited with them by Julius.
Jorg-ensen, who absconded from Den
mark with about 5S000 of his em
ployers' money. A number of suits
have been instituted by people who
claim to have an interest in the money
and the banks to-day have asked the
courts to restrain these suits. They
Ftate that theyare willing to pay the
â¢ money, principal and interest,
to S6300, to the court arid
let whoever can get it, but they do not
want- to be made parties to these ac
tions.
'Jorgensen came to this country
'about a year ago with Johanua^Iue,!
ler, leaving a wife behind him. He
was arrested at Berkeley and ' after
-peveral months' imprisonment was ex
tradited and taken back to Denmark,
where he was sentenced to serve a 
year's imprisonment. His time now is
nearly up. His attorneys here, the
firm from which the money was taken,
and other parties arenow endeavoring
to get the money.

'"There is nothing to be done but sub
mit," said Superintendent McClymonds
to-day. "The Board of Education has
been compelled to obey the State law
as it stands. We were officially warned
by the State Board of Health that we
must heed the act."
In the schools the returns from to
day's enrollment showed that many of
the parents had yielded to the situa
tion. Superintendent McClymOnds be
lieves that before the week has passed
the shortage noted yesterday will have
been overcome.
The Health Department Is swamped
with applications for vaccination. Un
der the strict ruling of the State Board
of Health touching enforcement of the
law that requires / pupils of the public
schools to submit to the operation,
there has been no alternative for pa
rents. However much they might ob
ject, the fathers and mothers have
been confronted by the choice of obey
ing the law or withdrawing their chil
dren from school.
Scores of youths were turned away
when the schools opened because they
did not. have the requisite certificate of
successful vaccination. Many of these
children were from homes where the
family treasury's contents did npt per
mit extravagances. Hence the city
health authorities were called upon.
The supply of virus points was ex
hausted and a fresh lot was procured
last night from San Francisco. The
rush of yesterday was repeated to-day.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Aug. 9.
The eoa referred to was A. J. Jack
eon, a student of the University of
California, who died last December. At
â¢the "West Oakland home, where the
baby was taken, a letter similar to that
Bent to Jackson was received to-day.
â¢ In a handwriting Identical with that of
the note which was found pinned to
the* abandoned infant's garments. The
second missive read as follows:
6AN FRANCISCO. Aug. S, 1904.â D. Jack
* Bon Dear Sir: Hag It occurred to you that
tbÂ» younc woman who left the baby boy at
. your door admired yaur noble son. and If only
.fqr that reason will you net take him and do
for him? Perhaps If you do In later years
hU' feature* may repay ypu. for if Gud will
spare fcla he will be a bright man. Truly
. f'cun, A MOTHER.
Detective Quigley has been detailed
to- locate If possible the mysterious
â¢w.oman who left a baby at the rooms <Sl
D. Jackson, Vincent House, Seventh
aiid' Market 6treets, Saturday night.
Police interest In the case was height
ened to-day when Jackson gave the
Chief of Police a letter which he had
received yesterday. The message vr%s
Oakland Office, San Francisco Call,
â¢ 1016 Broadway, Aug. 9.
Since the announcement, made in San
Francisco several weeks ago, that Od
dle was in'that city consulting with his
lawyers concerning a divorce suit, the
relatives of his wife have been busily
engaged in trying to effect a reconcilia
tion between husband and wife, and
for a time it was thought that they
had succeeded in their efforts. Shortly
after Oddie returned to Tonopah from
the bay, statements appeared in the
Carbon and Reno papers -announcing
that he had acted hastily in his charges
against his wife and that the matter
had finally' been settled in an amicable
way. It is now claimed that these
statements did not emanate from the
husband.
Mrs. Oddie is the daughter of Rich
ard McDonald, who gained considerable
notoriety in San Francisco some years
ago in connection with the failure of
the Pacific and the People's Home Sav
ings banks. She was reared in Carson
City and married Oddie last December.
RENO. Nev.,'. Aug. 9.â The trouble
which has been, pending for several
weeks between Millionaire Tasker L.
Oddle, the well known mining man of
Tonopah, and'' his wife, has finally cul
minated in a suit for divorce. The hus
band, through, his attorneys in San
Francisco, has instituted proceedings
for a permanent separation from his
wife in the court at Belmont. He
charges cruelty.
The complaint has been served on
Mrs. Oddle, who will be represented in
court by Attorney Bartlett of Tonopah,
who has announced that the suit will
be bitterly contested. '
Those who are acquainted with the
Oddies look for some sensational de
velopments during the progress of the
case, for it is expected that if the wife
Insists In fighting her husband, he will
file an amended complaint based on
more serious accusations.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Insurance, -generally speaking, Â¦will
not cover a .third of the loss sustained.
The fire burned itself out at 7 o'clock.
When the fire department arrived on
the scene from the iron works nothing
could be done, as the water presure
was quite insufficient, .the burning sec
tion being on high ground. Victorians
were alarmed at this, as it was real
ized that only the direction of the wind
prevented a grgat calamity, and that
the fire-fighting apparatus was prac
tically worthless unless the water sup
ply improved. The homes destroyed
were mostly those oÂ£ the better class of
working people, and the loss will be
felt by many. â¢
Flames broke out !n a pattern room
of the iron works and destroyed a large
section of the building, together with
machinery valued at $50,000. High wind
carried the sparks a quarter of a mile
away to the residential part of the city
north of Douglas street, where about
forty houses were destroyed In less
than two hours. The fire department
was occupied at the Iron works pre
venting the spread of flames in the
immediate vicinity and allowed the fires
to the north to get beyond control be
fore tackling them. Adjoining the iron
works are the extensive timber yards
of Saywards and the gas works.
If the flames had spread over that
section half of Victoria would have
been in ashes now, but this danger was
averted. The wind, while strong, held
steadily toward the northwest and so
doomed to destruction only a small
section of the city which iÂ« bounded to
the north and west by open fields.
The fire did its work with rapidity,
but owing to the assistance of many
volunteers, Including sailors from her
Majesty's navy, Esquimau and soldiers
from barracks, a large proportion of
furniture and personal effects of the
residents in the fire area was saved.
VICTORIA, B. C.. Aug. 9.â About
sixty families are rendered homeless
and property to the approximate value
of $150,000 is destroyed as the result of
a fire which started in the Albion Iron
Works, in the tenderloin district, this
afternoon. -
Special Dl3patch to The Call.
D. Jackson Eeceives Unsign
ed Note From Woman Urg
ing Him to Care for Child
Superintendent McClymonds
Declares State Officials
Insist Upon Enforcement
"I stand by what I said last night in
the board meeting," the irate Trustee
declared. "I said that I wished ray
resignation to take effect on September
1 and I will insist upon its being ac
cepted. If I cannot get what I want in
my own district from the board it
seems to me I may as well quit. I re
peat what I said last night, that if the
other members are going to usurp the
right to run my ward, then I will get
out. Trustees Hoff and Dowd have
lately voted against me on everything
I have brought up. Hut I did not care
so much until they showed such mani
fest unfairness in this matter."
The question that precipitated the
quarrel was one concerning the widen
ing of Derby street to make it of uni
form width. There are two or three
houses that encroach upon the street,
and it only needs that these shall be set
back In order to straighten out the
avenue. Hbff and Dowd and the other
members of the board take the ground
that the improvement is for the benefit
of the city at large, and that it will
be less a hardship on the people to
have the work done now than later,
when the property will be so much
more valuable.
Redmond C. Staats, member of the
Board of Trustees from the Seventh
Ward, insists that he will stand by the
announcement* that he hurled In the
teeth of bis colleagues last night when
he' declared he would resign. Staats
feels hurt by the indignities which he
thinks have been heaped upon him, and
will not entertain any requests to re
consider his resignation. He set all ru
mors at rest to-night by saying that he
would most emphatically decline to re
call his action.

REPUBLICAN CONVENTION
OF NEVADA NOMINATES
NIXON FOR THE SENATE
for', Bates for theÂ«. Assembly, but
wanted the delegation for himself for
Senator. Bates was backed by State
Senator Knowland and his friends,
while Taylor went to. his fight, him
self. The Bates ticket was carried by
0. vote of 720 to 382. This means that
District Attorney W. M. Simpson will
get the nomination for. State Senator
to succeed J. R. Knowland as soon as
Mr. .Knowland resigns to take the
nomination for Congress. The fight
was a spirited one, resulting in the
largest number of votes ever polled at
a primary election in Alameda with
the lone exception of the Metcalf-Hil
born fight for Congress.
The Republicans elected delegates
to the Congressional convention to be
held in Vallejo on August 16 and dele
gates to the State convention. There
were no opposition tickets anywhere in
the county for these places.
.J. R. Knowland will take, the entire
delegation from Alameda County to
Vallejo for him for Congress and as
there is no other candidate against
him his rioniinatien will be unanimous.
There is no contest of any kind in
the State delegation, which will prob
ably favoy, F. M. Smith, head of the
Pacific Coast Borax Company and the
â¢Key. route ferry, for Presidential
Elector from the Third Congressional
District. No plans, -however, have
been decided upon.
The old Engllsh-Laymance wing of
the Democratic party has returned to
power. ;, They - put tickets in the field
in- ever.y Assembly District in the
county to-day and won five out of the
seven districts. The Fitzgerald hench
men won only the Fiftieth and Fifty
second Assembly districts. This will
give, the English-Laymance faction
control of the coining county conven
tion,, but better than that it will give
them control .of the county committee
for the fight two years. from now. The
vote was very small, .In some districts
barely registering * ten ballots for the
party.'
There was no fight in the Union
Labor party and the faction that is in
control ' of the party machinery now
retains its grip.
SAN DIEGO, Aug. 9.â This year's
honey crop in this county will be prac
tically a complete failure, owing to a
lack of bee feed caused by scant rain
faH during last winter. Many colonies
of bees in all likelihood will be lost,
while others will be carried through
on bought honey. This is the # first
honey crop failure this country has ex
perienced.

. FRESNO, . Aug. 9.â Primaries were
held throughout Fresno County to
day.. In the Democratic party there
were no'contests and no issues, so there
was but little Interest taken. .. -*.T
In the Republican party the old fac
tional fight was on in good earnest.
Returns received make certain that
Drew and Chandler will receive the
nominations for Assemblymen. If they
are elected they will support Senator
Bard for re-election. The county cen
tral committee will remain in control
of men friendly to Senator Chester
Rowell.
REPUBLICANS SUPPLY
THE TROUBLE AT THE
PRIMARIES IN, FRESNO
WASHINGTON, Aug. 9. â Heads of
Government departments have let it
be known that their officials, are not
to take an active part in local or State
politics, where their activity might
prove compromising in any way to the
administration. President "Roosevelt
has declined to be drawn into fac-^
tional troubles in any State and it is
not deemed desirable that Federal of
ficials should be active in such con
tests.
Recently It was intimated to H.
Smith Woolley, assayer of the. Mint
at Boise, Idaho, and to Robert' Grim
mon, United States Marshal of , the
same State, that they would** better
not participate in" the Republican
State" convention, as' their appear
ance as delegates or as active partici
pants in the proceedings might be
misconstrued.
Federal. Officials Warned Not to Take
Part in Politics.
MUST REMAIN INACTIVE.
Continued From Page 4, Column 5.
The ticket was completed as follows:
Presidential electorsâ Thomas H. Sa
vey of Newcastle, Manlove Hayes of
Kent and Dr. William P* Orr of Sus
sex; Governor, Dr. Joseph H. Chand
ler; Lieutenant Governor, Samuel H.
Derby; Congress, Horace G. Knowles;
Attorney General, Robert H. Richards;
Insurance Commissioner, Charles
Maull; Treasurer, Thomas N. Rawlins;
Auditor -of Accounts, George H. Dick.
The platform indorsed -Roosevelt and
demands the vigorous enforcement of
Delaware laws against bribery.
It is not considered possible that the
union Republicans will indorse the
nomination of Dr. Chandler for Gov
ernor, Â¦*Â¦ although they may not object
to Knowles for Congress or Richards
for Attorney General.
"I would rather suffer honest de
feat," he declared, "than be pulled off
the ticket that somebody eise might be
substituted."
This was received with deafening
cheers from the Dupont men, who had
won a victory over tlie Higgins forces
in nominating Chandler.
The regulars who composed to-day's
convention are really outnumbered by
the union, or Addicks, Republicans,
and when in recent years they have
made out a ticket it has alwavs been
with the understanding that a truce
would be patched up later and that the
Republican factions would agree to
trade and substitute nominees, making
one ticket to meet the union Republi
cans' demands. vV ' A
Many of the Dupont delegates, after
the completion of the State ticket to
day, believing they had won a victory
against any alliance with Addicks, or
Addicks Republicans, left for their
homes.
The Higgins men, who are more con
ciliatory to the Addicks Republicans,
and desire one State ticket, even at a
sacrifice, after manv of the delegates
had left, empowered the State Central
Committee to make any changes upon
the. ticket named to-Say which, in its
judgment, was necessary to bring
about the success of the whole Repub
lican ticket In Delaware. ,
DOVER, Del., Aug. 9.â Dr. Joseph
Chandler, when he was nominated for
Governor of Delaware by the "regu
lar" Republican convention to-day,
created a profound stir, by taking the
pjatform and declaring that he accept
ed the nomination under the sole con
sideration that he would enter the
fight to the end and stay on the ticket
until November.

EXCITEMENT AT THE
BERKELEY PRIMARIES
BERKELEY, Aug. 9â The Democrats
were the only party to make any fight
over the primaries in Berkeley. There
was only one set of delegates for each
of the Republican conventions, so that
little interest was shown among the
stalwarts. But for the Democrats,
some 6f the Republicans would have
forgotten there was a primary. It was
the Democratic noise that â¢ awakened
the Republicans. ; , ';
The regular Democratic ticket, head
ed by Niles B. Searls, Clyde E. Ab
bott and Olin Welburn Jr., fought it
out with a ticket headed by Dennis
Landregan. The former won out, 101
to 31. Landregan tickets hardly ap
peared in East Berkeley* and did not
score heavily in West Berkeley. By
winning, out, the regulars keep in
check the Laymance-English forces
that sought control of the county, con
vention and will, nominate the Assem
blyman from the Fifty-second District.
Old-Time Republicans in Line.
OAKLAND, Aug. 9. â The Quarter

lican party who have voted the ticket
for not less than twenty-five years,
has been reorganized in anticipation
of the coming Presidential campaign.
The Club was first organized on July

There being* no contests in the ranks

Army Losses From Illness.
During the years from; 1882 to 1901
the French-' army lost 67,000 men by
illness, while In Germany the corre
sponding figure was only 25,000 men.
The cause of this disparity lies large
ly In the effort tQ t keep the army of
France.'whose population is 20,000,000
less than that of Germany, equal in
size to Germany's, the consequence-be
ing that many recruits are accepted
who- are bound to succumb .to the se

LINCOLN, Neb., Aug. 9.â Fusion
with the Democrats on State ; and pos
sibly electoral ticket is the t dominant
question before Populist delegates who
are here for to-morrow's State conven
tion, which will be held at the same
hour the Democrats meet. Thus far
all overtures for fusion have come from
the Democrats, with the Populists bad
ly 'divided on the wisdom of its adop
tion. Prospective candidates for of
fice on the State ticket naturally lean
to fusion, while it is noteworthy' that
national leaders in the party, a num
ber of whom live in Nebraska, have
advised against it.
Secretary Charles de France pf : Lin
coln, secretary of the Populist Nation
al'Committee, said the only basis of
fusion would be the support by the
Democrats of Watson and Tibbies'
electors and ,an eq ual Â¦ division of the
State offices. In this declaration De
France is upheld bv Thomas H. Tib

is supposed Thomas E.Wats<5n; the
Presidential candidate, entertains the
same view.

the day, : getting eight delegates out
side of Vallejo, while Devlin won the
four delegates in Vallejo.
This county is joined to Napa Coun
ty in the Fifth Senatorial District.
Senator Corlett of Napa has his coun
ty behind him, with ten delegates in
the joint convention to be held in
Napa August 12. Hence neither of
the three candidates has a majority of
the delegates.
The outcome of the convention Is

competition of the water lines, that it
would hold back the growth of Pacific

NEW YORK, Aug. 9.â Many promi
nent Democrats were in the city to
night to make final arrangements for
the notification of Judge Parker to
morrow.. The notification committee
met and approved a draft of the for
mal notification.
It was said to-night that not only
will Charles F. Murphy go to Esopus,
but nearly every Tammany district
leader will be there. Many members
of the National Committee have re
turned to s the city and will. go to Eso
pus to-morrow.
The formal ceremony will probably
begin between 2:30 and 3 p. m. and will
occupy about two hours.
The opening speech will be that of
Chairman Champ Clark of Missouri,
who will formally, notify Judge Parker
of his nomination and will present to
him a certified copy of the platform
adopted by the St. Louis convention
and of the message decided upon by the
convention in reply to the Judge's tele
gram on the gald standard sent to
William F. Sheehan. Judge Parker
will follow Clark with his speech for
mally accepting the nomination. No
other speeches are arranged for.
The ceremony will be followed by an
informal reception, after which the
visitors will depart.
Daniel S. Lament, former Secretary
of War. whose name is prominently
mentioned in connection with the Dem
ocratic nomination for Gqvernor of
New York, and United States Judge
George Gray of Delaware were visit
ors at Rosemount' to-day. Judge Gray
would not talk politics. Lamont said
his own visit r had no political signifi
cance. He Baid, however, that he was
not a candidate for the nomination for
Governor. Moreover, he declared that
he believed an emergency that would
make it his duty to accept such a nom
ination was very remote.:;'-;
ESOPTJS, Aug. 9.â Preparations are
practically complete at Rosemount to
night for the formal notification to
morrow of Judge A." B. Parker of his
nomination as Democratic candidate
for the Presidency. These prepara
tions are notably simple. In the morn
ing flags and bunting will be draped
about the low platform from which the
speeches are to be delivered and seats
will be arranged conveniently, about it
on the lawn north of the house. Every-'
thing will then be in readiness for the
arrival of the steamer Sagamore,
which will bring the notification com
mittee from New York City. The boat
is expected to arrive between 1:30 and
2 p. m., and in case of inclement
weather the notification ceremony will
take place upon the boat. It is expect
ed that 1500 people will be present to
hear the speeches, 500 of them from
Ulster County, in which the Judge's
home is located.
is the fact that in thepast he has been
guided largely In his political actions
by "Big Tim" Sullivan. They have
been the closest friends personally and
in this change Brooklyn politicians see
a disposition on the part of the Sulli
vans to oppose the leadership of
Murphy. .'- V'-Ti;
Sutherland occupies a unique position
in the politics of Brooklyn. Disfran
chised by his conviction of the John Y.
McKane frauds, he has never had his
citizenship restored. Despite the fact
that he has no vote he controls abso
lutely 700 Democratic voters, who will
follow him to any length, 'even into a
Republican camp. He will take with
him to" the McCarren'side enough men
from other sections of the district to
make the outcome of the primaries
doubtful, and if all the converts that
friends of Senator McCarren are claim
ing come with him the .district will
surely be lost to Tammany at the pri
maries. Sutherland said to-day that he
had left the Tammany end of the fight
for the reason that Brooklyn was not
getting proper treatment under the
Tammany administration. ." -
Senator' McCarren's supporters were
claiming to-night that .they would
make a clean sweep of the county in
the August primaries . and that the
Tammany men would, not control a
single Assembly District. Â«= .
Altogether it looks' as' if David B.
Hill, through his henchman, McCarren,
intends to tea'ch Murphy, a lesson, .and
either whip him into the Parker line or
have him deposed as Tammany leader.

"Acting Governor Atkinson, upon

Accordingly he sent for Mr. Henriques

LAST year . about a million of macaroni
wheat was raised in this country^ and the product
, this season will be much Â¦ larger. This wheat is,
botahically, the triticum durum, while our other wheats
are triticum vulgare. The characteristic of the durum
wheat is richness in gluten. There are many varieties
of Russian origin, and those that have proved best in this
country are the kubanka, yellow garriovka,* black "Don,
beloturka and velvet Don. These wheats are extensive
ly grown in the Dakotas, and are rnixed'with 20 per cent
of common wheat for gristing. . ; ,
'As. on the same. soil they have less starch and more
gluten than the common .wheats, they should be the sub
ject of experiment in California; where we must restore
gluten to hold our own as a wheat State. The'statement
is made that our millers import Dakota wheat for ad
mixture in gristing, and it is of interest to know- wheth
er any of the imported stock is macaroni wheat. These
wheats have long straw, and broad,' smooth leaves with
heavily bearded heads, having 3 much the ; appearance of

Indian Politics.
The effect of education upon the In
dian "has been to revolutionize politics,
and the Indian has taken up the white
man's method: the campaign commit
tee has taken the place of the barbe
cue and campaign literature the place
of the stump speech. The Indian takes
to politics like a mosquito to a swamp.
He can tell the effect of 'a policy upon
his people quicker than a white man;
and an'Indian politician, if one can get
him to tell the truth, can make an ac
curate estimate of the result of an elec
tion long before it takes place. The
Choctaws, while they do not show so
much progressiveness in other lines as
the Cherokees, are the best politicians
of the Five Tribes. . V
The Choctaw Indians have*dw>pped
the old Indian campaign and^nowvthe
winning party wins on a basis vthat
would do credit to any political ma-'
chine In the States. A regular cam
paign committee Is appointed. It has
plenty of money. From the time it Is
appointed until the campaign is over It
devotes Its entire time to the cam
paign.'. The greater part of its work is
compiling and distributing^; campaign
literature. Every Issue that is Involved
in the election is gone over thoroughly
and ; every, argument is answered. This
literature is printed in English Â¦: and
Choctaw. The party that has adopted
the new method, has won every elec
tion in the Choctaw nation. The party
that clings to' the old; Indian method
Is defeated. â Kansas City. Journal.

The Leak.
. Brigadier General George H. Harries
of the District of Columbia militia was
for many years an active newspaper
worker at the capital. Some years ago,
when a Senate Investigating committee
was trying to ascertain who gave the
press information concerning their ex
ecutive sessions, George Harries en
tered a committee room where Senator
Faulkner of West Virginia and Senator
Bate of Tennessee were discussing the
question, and Senator Faulkner said:
"Harries, I wish you would frankly tell
me how you newspaper fellows get In
formation concerning the transactions
of our secret sessions."
After a moment of reflection Harries
replied: "I should have no objeotion to
telling you If I knew you were author
ized to receive the Information."
"Then why don't you tell the commit
tee?" Inquired Senator Faulkner.
"Is the committee properly" consti
tuted and duty- authorized to receive
such information, Senator?"
"Of course It is."
"How do you make that out?"
"Why it was constituted by the Sen
ate In the regular way, under the
Dolph resolution," Replied Senator
Faulkner. He then went on to give
every detail of the manner in which the
Senate, in executive session, discussed
and adopted the resolution; how the
committee was constituted, and that it
was empowered to make the Investiga
tion. When the Senator had concluded
Harries said:
"Well, Senator Faulkner, that is the
way we newspaper^fellowg get our in
formation concerning all of the details
of the proceedings of the secret execu
tive sessions of the Senate."
Senator. Faulkner did not catch the
full significance of Harries' remark un

* The Merchant Marine.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Aug. 5.
Editor Callâ Dear Sir: Is Govern
ment aid what is needed to develop the
American merchant marine?
As long as present conditions prevail
Government aid, whether in the shape
of subsidies, export or import bounties,
will prevent rather than foster any de
velopment, because such assistance will
only tend to give an additional asset to
such companies as exist to-day, which,
firmly established already, control the
trade of the east and of the south, and
make rivalry out of the question.
No Government aid or bounty what
ever could have given life to any of the
steamship lines which attempted to ob
tain a share of the traffic of the south
ern countries. Freight rates have been
cut down from $20 to $4 and the vic
tory has always been for the subsidized
line. Nor have vessels sailing; under
foreign flags, British, Mexican, Chilean
â vessels of cheaper construction, man
ned by sailors and officers earning one
third of the" salaries paid to American
officers and men â been able to over
come the conditions composed by estab
lished linesr *:
Government . has rightly fomented
American industry and brought it up
to a condition where It can flood Euro
pean markets.. It would seem about
time to try and let such industries fight
their own battles. Mr. George "W.
Dickie tells us that American industry
makes Americans pay $55 per ton for
steel and he is content to let European
shipbuilders pay $35 per ton.
"Would it not be posible to foster new
lines of vessels in such a way that
there would be a chance of success?
Permit me to offer a suggestion,
crude enough no doubt, but which may
perchance offer an opening.
If it be lawful to limit the amount a
transportation company may charge
for freight and pasenger traffic In one
direction, why not may it be lawful to
impose certain restrictions in the con
trary sense?
A certain company charges the high
est rate for Its service. Another com
pany enters the field, at the same rate
or perhaps a trifle* less, the first imme
diately brings Its charges down to a
point where business can no longer be
carried on by the opposition,, and the
subsidized line helps to "sweep the
American flag from the ocean."
Now. if the transDortation company
had to fix its rate for the year, like the
water companies, for instance, or make
a declaration to the Government that it
intended to reduce. or increase its rate
for a given reason and for a stated
time, thus covering cases for legitimate
reductions for excursions, etc., then
there would be a possibility for other
lines to venture into the field. It is but
a few weeks since that we witnessed a
/war between steamship lines sailing on
'this coast, where one line was com
pelled to forego -carrying passengers
and confine Itself to lumber. Why
should \ transportation . companies be
permitted to state that their rates shall
be increaae*d or diminished at their own
will? If an established line charges $10,
for example, a competing line would
charge the s^me, or say $8; the first
company would then declare 1 Its inten
tion of making tke same rate or less, If
It liked, but it would be compelled to
stand by its new rate for one" year. By
that time If both companies were use
ful they, would work in harmony . and
the public would profit and new fields
would have' to, be developed.
V E. H. COFFEY.
IN the August number of the* Merchants' Association
Review an article by Miss L. L. Stebbins is published
with the caption "Eliniinating #â¢: the San Francisco
Hoodlum." Miss Stebbins" is the probation officer of the
juvenile court that was instituted for the purpose of
preventing the developmenty.of^wayward children into
confirmed criminals. Â¦ Tothe^' court f are brought San
Francisco boys and girls who are, traveling the swift road
to bad citizenship and who are! charged with some in
fraction of law. Miss Stebbins undertakes to enlighten
the public from the 'advantageous point of view of an
habitual and official observer '- concerning the practical
working of the first attempt that' has been made in San
Francisco in this line.
Before May, 1903, so writes Miss Stebbins, children
under sixteen years of age were cast into jail with crim
inals, prostitutes and drunkards, to come up in a police
court reeking with foul air and degradation. That has
been stopped. Arresting officers now tell the stories of
youthful delinquency to only the Judge, the parents and
the probation officer. The question in the mind of the
Judge is not the punishment to be meted out, but the
treatment that will help the boy or,girl to true manhood
or womanhood. , -
Before thtf hearing the probation officer delves intb the
character of tne child in detention and attempts to lo
cate the responsibility for acts, "which in nine cases out
of ten rests with the parents." She looks, up the child's
school record or the record of work. When the court
comes to consider the casV the Judge has-a*written his
tory of the culprit before him and the probation officer
stands ready to represent the young person.
Miss Stebbins . reports that about one-half the boys
are dismissed. These are usually lads of good standing,
with fair homes," who have offended by jumping on cars
and trains, " throwing rocks wildly, playing handball in
the, street or in similar ways. When there is a conflict
of evidence or when some new avenue of investigation
is suggested that would much illumine the situation the
case is held over for. one, two or three weeks, the boy
returning to his home or remaining in detention, to re
port again in court. .
There are one hundred boys on probation. Some of
these are less than fourteen years of age. They are re
ceiving 1 , the ; attention of the" truant officers and are get
ting aid from school Â¦ . rincipals and teachers on the way
to steadiness, arid honesty. Many of the truants are
victims .of the padrone system. The* older boys, those
more than fourteen years of age, are required to report
to the probation, officer every Friday, evenfng. All but
one or two of such boys are kept steadily at work and
are reported to be "daily 'growing", more responsible." It
is the aim of the juvenile court to 'stimulate a desire in
boys to learn a trade and then to find occupation. This
last is not always easy.
Employers balk at the mention of the juvenile court.
Only with the co-operation of the school and the em
ployer is it possible to cheat the reform school, save
the taxpayer aifd create^ good citizens. In these state
ments there is food for thought. Miss Stebbins ex
presses surprise than any man or woman in San Fran
cisco should fail to take personal interest in the at
tempt to save boys. The fund for the probation-of
ficer's salary and incidentals, the expense of sending a
sickly child to the country or money for a waif's neces
sary change of clothing^ or for temporary board is pro
vided; with, the greatest -difficulty by the juvenile court
committee.:; --r- .'Â¦":"â¢ ... . .
He Had No Chance.
Ex-Congressman James D. Richard
son of Tennessee, who has given up
politics for Masonic activities, delights
to tell stories about the great Amer
ican game. "I had a friend," related
the Congressman recently to a group
of listeners, "who was a cotton planter
near New Orleans. One evening ha
boarded a Mississippi River steamboat
bound north. Becoming- lonesome, my
friend began looking for a little game
of draw. He was not long in finding
it, and sat in. He lost from the start,
and as the game progressed the stakes
kept getting higher. About 4 o'clock
in the morning my friend began to
realize that his chances of getting even
with that same were slim, when Just
then the steamboat whistle blew loud
and long. The planter pushed his
chair back from the table and said:
'Gentlemen. I have played in this hyar
game all night. I have lost and have
nothing to say on that account; but
1*11 bet *100 that I can hotter louder
than the whistle on this boat.' The
stakes were put up and one of tha
gamblers hastened to the engineer and
bribed him to put on all the steam pos
sible. The party repaired to the deck.
The whistle was blown. The planter
yelled, but hl3 voice' was not heard.
â¢Gentlemen," said the victim of the po
ker sharks, 'in this hyar yellln' contest
I lost my money fa'r and squar'; but I
had a better chance to win than I had
in that pokah game I sat in all
night."*

'A Thesis on Mary.
Mary was a girl af platonlc tenden
cies. She loved a little Lamb. Mary
belonged the Band of Hope and
was the original precursor of. the S.
P. C. A. Love, though, is cruel, ac
cording to the poets and therefore
Mary 'was not a worthy philanthropist.
If Mary had any brothers or sisters
it was very selfish of her to love the
Lamb. so much. Maybe she didn't love
her mother; 'maybe her mother was
cruel to her and made her sweep
down the kitchen steps every Thurs
day as near 12 o'clock as possible.
That* may account for the psycholog
ical truth of reasoning set up in
Mary's mind which ultimately result
ed in her affection for the Lamb. The
only theory to explain In any satisfac
tory manner Mary's love for the Lamb
is that she was a girl of Platonic ten
dencies.
An English psychologist has en
deavored to arrive at a solution of the
problem by advancing the theory of
prenatal Influences.. At present, how
ever, no one is In a position to state
authpritatively that the constant pres
sure of an angora goat rug in the
front parlor of Mary's mother's home
would so work upon the subconscious
self resident in Mary's mother's mind
as 'to produce by its aura a love for
the Lamb in Mary. Such casuistries
belong to the domain of pseudo-sci
ence rather than to pure reasoning.
Since there is one link lacking in
the chain and that the direct evidence
of Mary herself we must-ilean to the
most natural solution of - this vexed
problem, the one that first suggests
itself to reason, the one that best
stands the test of every contradictory
hypothesis brought to bear upon it.
Mary was a girl of Platonic tenden
cies.
THE constitution of California requires that the
State, county and loca* revenues' shall be derived
from a general property tax. This of course is in
tended to include in one assessment air the realty and
personalty of the State, whether in individual, partner
ship or corporate ownership. The inequality of this sys
tem has long been notorious. The burden of taxation
falls upon realty, and upon such forms of personalty as
live stock and farm implements. ;â¢' â¢ I Â¦
Experience of this inequality has led the State Grange
to an examination of the subject, in quest- of a remedy.
A committee was appointed by that body to investigate'
and report a plan for tax reform. The committee had
the assistance of Professor Plehn of the # State Univer
sity, whose investigations and reports upon the economic
features of taxation are accepted as texts' everywhere.
His conclusion is that the general property tax is wrong
in principle, for the reason that personal property is
easily subject to. sequestration and evasion of assess
ment and the burden it should bear is put 'upon realty.
To prove this progressive inequality, he shows thar
the amount of personalty assessed in this State in 1896
was 16 per cent less than the amount assessed in 1872,
while in the same period the assessment of realty in
creased two and a quarter fold! * To state it in another
form, in 1880 personal property was nearly 27 per cent
of the total assessment of the State; in 1896 it was only
a little more than .14 Per cent of the. total. Omitting
from the assessment of both years the railroad prop
erty, the assessed valuation of the personalty of the
State was 21 per cent in- 1880 and in 1896 only 12 per
cent of the whole. In the seventeen years from 1880 to
1896 the increase in the assessment of realty was 125 per
cent, while the increase in 'personalty â¢ was "only 8 per
cent.
Not only does this inequality exist, but another ap-.
pears in the assessment of realty in cities and in the
country. The realty of a farmer is assessed from 8
to 12 per cent higher, that is to say, nearer its true value,
than realty in the city.
The conclusion from these and other disclosures of a
careful investigation shows that equality is impossible
under a general property tax. The committee recom
mends that the derivation of revenue to support the
State government be from another source than a general
property tax. In this connection the well-known sys
tems, long followed, of Connecticut, New Jersey, Penn
sylvania and Wisconsin, are cited. In those States there
is no property tax for the support of the State govern
ments. That support is derived entirely from a tax, or
license upon corporations and franchises, which are
exempted from taxation for county and local purposes.
This leaves the general property of the State to respond
only for the support of county and local government, re
lieving it from a State tax entirely.
The report of the United States Industrial Commis
sion on the subject of taxation says that in Connecticut
these special taxes exceed the current expenditure of
the. State and leave a surplus to liquidate the State debt.
In New Jersey the. report' says that the revenues derived
from the special tax on railroad and canal corporations,
riparian lands and the franchise, tax on miscellaneous
corporations, on interstate and collateral inheritance, is
sufficient to defray all State expenses, and that the sys
tem of taxing corporations directly by the State is effi
cient, simple, certain and economical. In Pennsylvania
the taxes for State purposes are almost wholly paid by
corporations, leaving individuals subject to taxation for
local purposes only, except that mortgages, bonds and
other classes of personal property taxable under, the
laws of the State and owned by corporations pay a
State tax, three-fourths of which is returned to the coun
ties. . â¢
The Grange Committee concludes: "In those States de
riving their revenue by license or tax on corporations
and exempting such corporations from county, district,
township and local tax, the system gives good satisfac
tion to both State and corporations, as it requires them
to deal in their assessments with the State, alone. In
our consideration of the subject we are fully satisfied
that the system of raising the State revenue by a tax on
corporations is the easiest, fairest and most equitable
that has come under our consideration, and it also re
lieves the counties of a tax for State purposes. One very
desirable object would be accomplished by it in Califor
nia; it would do away with equalization of property be
tween counties, which, under the system adopted by the
State Board of Equalization, is notoriously unjust.", .
The report further proposes that^ the State derive the
$3,000,000 now required for support of the public schools
by indirect taxation. As the internal revenue tax of the
Federal Government on ,beer, spirits and tobacco
amounts to over three milli6ns a year, there is no rea
son why that form of property should, not be relieved
from local license and subjected to. a State excise, ade
quate for the support of the schools.
The Grange has made a good case, backed by a suf
ficiency of facts, and it should now formulate the neces
sary amendment to the constitution and -get the sub
ject fairly before the people for action by the next Legis
lature. .. ,< . -

The crop in this country is in demand for use in the
macaroni factories. If it prove, however, that the gluten
of these wheats, can reinforce the common wheats with
good results in the loaf, the. product is sur^ to largely
increase. Macaroni is made in the .United States from
common wheat flour,- but it' is not, strong as a food arti
cle, for lack of gluten, having the same infirmity as bread
made jfrom, flour that hasan excess of starch. '
We 'â¢' hope that next season will furnish'manyj'experi

be no loss on the crop, for our macaroni product is large

The State of, Idaho, in its effort to
develop its mineral resources by ex
hibiting at the world's fair, goes fur
ther than merely show ores and al
luring nuggets and gems. JL W. Mc-
Bride, the Mineral Commissioner of the
State, who has charge of its mining
exhibit, is prepared to teach every ten
derfoot who applies how to find the
precious metal- and how to locate' a
claim when he does find it. Idaho
doesn't care to lure the guileless city
man and farmhand into her mountains
and let them waste their time drilling
into granite boulders or panning on
top of loam hillocks. She wants them
to find some of the precious metal, and
is willing to point the way. Commis
sioner McBride is supplied with para
phernalia by which he can show em
bryo miners how to prospect and how
to tell barren country from "indica
tions." He pounds quartz in a mortar
and pans it out before "the pupils. He
shows them rock, clay and gravel that
is auriferous and sections of prospect-
Ing work underground.

exhibit gold dust, nuggets, free gold
quartz and twenty-dollar pieces. The

there was not one to show himself ig
noble. The volunteers fell over each
other like the illustrious Japanese who
sprang forward to ride to post mortem
glory on the illy appointed ships that
Admiral Togo chose to cork up Port
Artbur channel, through which the ef
fervescent Russian fleet was constantly
bubbling. Every man present wanted
to sign the agreement, so there was
really more glory for those who gave
way than for the ten who signed.

decided on a railroad excursion on the
Mobile and Ohio Railroad, to connect
with the chicken dinner at Waterloo. A

CALL BUREAU, -WORLD'S FAIR,
ST. LOUIS, Aug. 9.â Those county com
missioners from California are certain
ly irrepressible. They are not going to
let any one forget that California Is on
the map. They have made the best
general display here that the State has
ever had at an exposition, and they are
not sitting down and letting It go at
that. They are determined to make
noise enough to draw attention to their
show. They have taken advantage ot
nearly every public occasion and "pa
rade to do something out of the or
dinary, and now they are planning a
new method of obtaining recognition.
Sunday, the one day they have away
from their exhibits, hangs heavily on
the shoulders ef the California exhib
itors in St. Louis. The good people of
the city go to church and spend the
rest of the day at their homes. The
Californians don't care to attend wor
ship because they haven't had time to
become acquainted with any pastors
and it is embarrassing to go to church
when vou no not know the preachers.
In this extremity the county commis
sioners' organization met to .adopt
means of coping with the dilemma. It
was decided that some excursions to
shady places and cool crooks, with
iced watermelon and claret punch that
didn't have a week-day strength would
be within the bounds of propriety, see
ing they were from California. Several
members told abo\it places thev had
heard of that were not many miles
distant on the wooded bluffs of the

ter of the late United States Senator
;-Jdhn"L. Mitchell. The selection was
â¢ made this afternoon by a special com

EpecUl Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug.* 9. â Pictur
esquely, but quite adequately garbed,
a party of eight Moro and Ygorrote
chiefs, constituting a part of the
Philippine exhibit at the St. . Louis
Exposition, to-day paid their respects
to President Roosevelt at the White
House. The exchanges between the
chiefs and the President were infor
mal, but happy in their tone. Through
Antero, a bright 15-year-old Ygorrote
boy, who acted as interpreter, the
Moro dattos and the Ygorrote chiefs
expressed their pleasure at being re
ceived by the President and told him
he might depend upon their loyalty
to the American Government.
President Roosevelt, after shaking
hands with each one of his little
brown visitors, replied that he was
glad of the opportunity to greet them,
to welcome them to the national capi
tal* and to assure them that the
American Government desired to pro
mote their welfare, prosperity and
contentment. As the President's
kindly expressions were interpreted to'
them by Antero the dattos and chiefs
nodded their heads In approval and
expressed their thanks.
Before the conclusion of the recep
t!on the chiefs, through Antero, pre
sented to the President some hand
some native gifts, including curiously
carved metallic pipes, a beautifully
embellished i?pear and two shields, one
of closely woven native grass and the
other of wood covered with hide. After
they left the executive offices the Fili
pinos, were shown through the lower
apartments of the White House.
The party arrived to-day from St.
Louis accompanied by two guards
armed with native short swords, with
elaborately carveft . handles of ivory
and gold.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Monday, Aug.
8.â The American' legation has not yet
received a reply from the Porte regard
ing the demand upon the Turkish Gov
ernment for the same favored treat
ment for American schools, hospitals
and charitable institutions accorded
to other.powera. However, it is expect
ed by diplomats that the demands will
be granted .before the arrival of the
American squadron at Smyrna. .
WASHINGTON, AuÂ£. 9.â Secretary
Hay occupied considerable time at the
Cabinet meeting to-day In a presenta
tion of the latest phase of the Turkish
situation. He explained the reasons
which had actuated him in requesting
that the American European squadron
should be sent to Smyrna, the most
convenient port to Constantinople. . It
is not deemed wise by. the Secretary
that the reasons for this action should
be disclosed entirely- at this time.
Fresh negotiations with the Porte have
been instituted, and in the event of
their failure it may be that Minister
Leishman will leave Constantinople
and go aboard the American flagship,
thus creating a situation of some seri
ousness.
BERLIN, Aug. 9.â Secretary Hay's
course toward Turkey, according to
the official view here, is fully justifi
able. The officials here expect that the
Sultan will promptly yield to the
United States' demand before the dem
onstration at Smyrna reaches a serious
aspect.

I tell you that a man can stand a
- - whole lot of pain When it is in an arm
or a leg or even in the head, but when
a pain begins to locate about the heart,
it takes the nerve of a lion to fight
against iÂ£ I am a pioneer â I am not a
boy by any means, as my picture above
will show, and most of my life I have
b^erv a mighty Tiealthy man â a doctor
. back in Ohio about sixty years ago told
me that I was going to die quite young
of heart disease. Poor doctor, he has
been dead many a year now, and here I
aril, strong and well.
Sometime ago I was attacked by rheu-
matism. I did not pay much attention
to it until it began to settle around my
heart. It began to cut my breath short;
then I thought it about time to do some-
"ihing. I had little faith in any medical
* treatment for such a trouble and fortun-
* ately about this time I heard of the
Elcctro-Chemic treatment.
â¢ Â«I went to the Electro-Chemlc Insti-
tute, 118 Grant avenue, and the Epecial-
'â¢ i^ts promptly found out what ailed me.
ar.d'I was so pleased with the thorough
manner in which I was examined that I
at once beyan the Electro-Chemic treat-
"raent,
. I" took the treatment just one month,
and In that short time, at a small ex-
pense, I was thoroughly cured. My pain
Is all gone, my rheumatism Is cured and
I fe<4 stronger and better in every way.
I have lived at Colma." California, just
,.6ut5i<3e of San Francisco, for thirty-
eeven years. I was Postmaster for twelve
years. Notary Public for fourteen years
and chairman of the Board of Supervis-
ors for four years. My name is Jacob
â¢Bryan, nnd I wish to recommend the
Electro-Chemlc treatment to all sufferers

I believe it to b* better than any other.

"Wallop when a wallop means a
Ten" was the watchword yesterday on
the Oakland baseball grounds. None of
Â¦ the native tossers overlooked many
chances when a run was to be had. It
was great shooting, for that Oakland
. field Is just the place to make a good
hit and clear off the bases. The locals
had the strife corraled long before the
game was old enough to count. Score:
San Francisco 8. Seattle 2.
Young Mr. Hall got his. He could
not shoot anything at the pan that was
not right for the Harris layout. They \
&11 hit, especially in the first three in
nings, when it counted most. Barber
was warmly welcomed by the Siwash
â¢ batFmen at times, but their eleven hits
Â«" d not do much damage.
The first round brought two in and
in the third the game practically coN
lapsed, for then the home swatters
landed for three and Barber com
menced to do some fine work. He had
t' em all under the spell of his twisters
Â¦when men were on bases. Waldron,
out In left field, helped out some by
blocking many a fine drive and cut
ting off many a fine hit by his good
judgment. The score:

GAXS-GAKDNER MATCH
Alex Greggains Has a Card
AVhicIi Is Pronounced a
Wonder by Sporting 3Ien
>â^--^;
From some flashes of unexpected
speed shown by Jack Munroe in his
training work yesterday at the beach
the spectators who crowded his gym
nasium came to the conclusion that the
miner. In his easy-going, good-natured
way. Is not showing up his best work
at all times.
While punching the big, swinging
bag, which nearly approaches his op
ponent in bulk. Jack turned loose a
volley of blows which were wholly un
expected. Again, when Andy Galla
gher had him in a corner, he worked
his way out along the ropes skillfully
and then turning suddenly on his box
ing partner he showed he could have
landed some telling blows hadjie been
in earnest.
Owing to his sore foot he went only
four rounds yesterday with his spar
ring mates. He took Chester on for
two rounds and Twin Sullivan and
Andy Gallagher for one each. He then
tossed the medicine ball for a time. He
cut out his swim in the ocean.
From present indications the specta
tors at the big fight will see two superb
athletes strip for the fray. Jeffries'
physical proportions are well known,
and Munroe will present . an equally
formidable appearance. He is becom
ing trimmer day by day, and there are
indications that much of his time is
spent in conscientious work on the
road.
Munroe is in the highest of spirits
and seems to give little heed to the im
portant engagement with Champion
Jeffries.
Alex Greggains-has made a v match
which is expected to prove sensational,
to say the least. He has acceptances
from Joe Gans and Jimmy Gardner for
a fight late in next month. Both men
will weigh about 138 pounds. Gardner
has been seeking this match for some
time, and conservative followers of the
ring who have seen him in action think
he can lower the colors of the formid
able Baltimore boxer. Gardner's last
fight was with Willie Fitzgerald, whom
he defeated in five rounds. Gardner is
only 19 years old. He is said to have
the best left hand ever developed by
an American boxer. He has great
speed, coupled with hitting powers.
Battling Nelson and Aurelio Herrera
will meet in a twenty-round fight in
Los Angeles about the middle of Sep
tember. They are guaranteed a $3000
purse or they can take 60 per cent of
the gate receipts. Herrera is a harder
hitter than any of the other men Nel
son has met. It remains to-be seen if
he can hurt the conqueror of Hanlon.

â¢opened the home series to-day by win
ning with ease, batting Iberg at op
portune times. Fitzgerald received a
bad start when, with two down, Thiel
nian hit safely. BecJc and Drennan
each drew passes and Castro brought
in two runs with a single. Fitzgerald
settled down to work, but began to
loaf in the fifth, when Thielman and
Beck doubled and Castro hit for three
sacks. Iberg struck out. Outside of
these two innings, the Brownies had
Dot the ghost of a show. In the first
Spencer's error gave Sheehan a start,
McLaughlin's triple scoring him.
Eagan's double and Casey's safe one
followed, bringing in three. In the
fourth Casey hit for two bases and
Kogan beat out a bunt. Fitzgerald's
single brought both home after Hogan
- stole second. , The home team made
it seven in the fifth, with singles by
McLaughlin and Eagan, Lynch's sacri
fice and Casey's safe one. The Tacoma
team played a fast fielding game.

Roche completed to-day his 3000-mile
endurance trip to and from St. Louis
in an automobile. When La Roche
reached the clubhouse from which he
started on the record breaking trip
the engine of his big touring car had
revolved without a stop for fifteen
days and two hours, and he had cov
ered 3450 miles and had exceeded! .the
previous world's non-stop record by
more. than 1400 miles. The best pre
vious performance was a continuous
run of 2013 miles, made by D. M.
Wiegel In England.

AUTOMOBILJST ESTABLISHES
A NEW ENDURANCE RECORD
The directors of the State Board of
Agriculture, under whose direction the
State Fair is held annually at Sacra
mento, have, unwittingly, let down the
bars so that the outlaw horsemen who
have been racing at the Union Park
track at St. Louis may race at the
forthcoming meeting, which commences
on the 22d inst. Â¦?.Â¦'â¢Â¦%Â¦'
At a meeting when the stake book
was being prepared the directors voted
to hold their. races under the rules of
the Pacific Jockey Club, the governing
body of the sport on this coast. In the
hurry of preparing the book Secretary
Miller clipped portions of a book used
at a time before the Pacific Jockey
Club had assumed jurisdiction over the
racing here.
One of the portions so clipped read
that "all races will be run under "the
rules of the California State Board of
Agriculture." These books were spread
broadcast wherever horsemen congre
gate. Some of the men who have been
racing at St. Louis, but who are under
the ban of the representative racing
associations, were quick to see the op
portunity to enter their horses. They
did so and cannot now be prevented
from competing.
The officials of the Pacific Jockey
Club, knowing there was no intention
to question their jurisldlctlon over the
racing on this. coast, will take no steps
in the premises. The outlaws can race
throughout the Sacramento meeting,
but they will be barred from the tracks
of the New California Jockey Club and
of the Los Angeles Jockey Club.
STAGE CARPENTER JAILED
FOR ASSAULT* TO MURDER
J. E. Toohey Fires Shot at Woman
From Property Pistol Loaded
With Blank Cartridges.
James E. Toohey, stage carpenter at
the Chutes Theater, was arrested at
3 o'clock yesterday morning by po
liceman Ring and booked at the City
Prison on a charge of assault to mur
der. A few hours later he was re
leased on $50 cash bail after the facts
were made known. Ring was at
tracted by the report of a pistol at 12
Turk street. By the, time he reached
there a crowd had gathered. Mrs. M.
Laberere, the proprietress of the lodg
ing-house, told him that two young
men had raised a disturbance and one
had fired a shot at her. They had
run out of the house and were in a
saloon opposite. v; V
Ring went to the saloon and found
Toohey there. He pla'ced Toohey un
der arrest and Mrs. Laberere identified
him as the man who fired the shot at
her. Toohey was searched and a pis
tol found in his pocket. It contained
a blank cartridge and two empty
shells. Toohey was under the influ
ence of liquor and later he said he re
membered nothing after he had left
the Chutes. The pistol was a prop
erty one and was loaded with blank
cartridges.
STATUE IS STOLEN FROM
A GRAVE AT CEMETERY
Christian Erickson Reports to the Po-
lice an Act of Vandalism at
Mount Calvary. â¢
Christian Casimir Erickaon, 643
Iowa street, reported to the police
yesterday that vandals had visited the
grave of his 15-year-old daughter in
Mount Calvary Cemetery and had
stolen from the monument erected to
her memory a statue representing the
figure of a child holding an hour glass.
Erickson had not visited the grave for
two weeks and when he went there
on Sunday he made the discovery of
the act of vandalism. The police will
make a search of the second-hand
stores for the stolen figure.
Several complaints of acts of van
dalism apparently' done by tramps at
the cemetery have recently been re
ported to the police, and it is alleged
that since* interments have been
stopped there has been a lack of
proper supervision. Only a few nights
ago three tramps were discovered
asleep in one of the vaults. They
were roused from their slumbers and
driven from the cemetery.

SARATOGA, N. Y., Aug.' 9.â The
double success of Captain S. S.
Brown's colors to-day were the only
notable events of an otherwise fea
tureless day's racing. That famous
classic, the Travers stakes for three
year-olds, brought only three horses
to the post. Of this small field Broom
stick and Auditor represented Captain
Brown. Bobadil, which was beaten
badly in a selling race here a few days
ago, was John A. Drake's representa
tive. â¢ '
Even though he had up 129 pounds
no one thought Broomstick was in
danger of defeat, hence the odds . of
1 to 6 at first quoted against him were
cut to 1 to 8 and 1 to 10. After that
all betting on the race was for second
place and Auditor carried some heavy
commissions. Soon after the start
Broomstick went to the front and,
opening a gap of six lengths of day
light, he was never approached by the
other two. All the way. round the far
turn Auditor and B,obadil ran like a
double team. Nearing the last quar
ter Bobadil began to leave Auditor,
which in spite of heavy punishment
continued to drop back and tie three
horses passed the Judges' stand strung
out. Broomstick was a ridiculously
easy winner, with Bobadil almost as
easily second. The race, one and a
quarter miles, was run in 2:06 4-5.

; CHICAGO. Aug. 9.â Miss Crawford,
which was coupled with Sioux Chief
as the W. W. Darden & Co. entry, won
the mile and three-sixteenths handi
cap at Harlem to-day. She was rid
den by Henry and, coming: from be
hind, finished with a rush and won
by a length with plenty in. reserve.
Bragg barely got the place by half a
length from Port Royal, which, after
running out, closed with a wild rush
near the outside fence and got up in
time to beat the good thing, School
mate, by a neck for third money.
On account of the field being .bo
badly strung out the finish was de
cidedly deceiving, many spectators
thinking Port Royal had finished sec
ond. It^was a viciously run . race
throughout and it - was anybody's
money until the wire was reached.
.The Darden entry, was at 4 to 1 and
was only lightly played. Huzzah was
always favorite at 5 to 2, backed from
3 to 1. Bragg was the next best liked
by the talent and was at 7 to 2, with
Port Royal at 5, to 1. The talent had
decidedly the better of the bookmak
ers, backing three winning favorites
and two second choices.
The track was ,. lightning fast, , the
weather cloudy and threatening and
the attendance about as usual. Sum

Shipping Intelligence.
.The British bark Auldglrth. which arrived
June 2 from Caleta Buena, cleared yesterday
for Liverpool. In view of the long spell of
Idleness to which scarcity of charters has
condemned many of her sisters, the Auld
glrth's stay in this port has been remarkably
brief. At Sausallto, Martinez and in Oak
land Creek there are British ships laid up.
Some of them have been resting so long
that they are now considered permanent fea
tures of the landscape. The veteran loafer
of the laid up fleet is the British ship Silver
horn, which arrived here January 21, 1902. She
is at Sausallto, where for more than two yeara
her crew has been chipping off rust, painting,
chipping, painting, the operations following
each other In an endless weary succession.
Others that arrived here in 1002 are: Achna
fhie and Cawdor, at Martinez; Ellisland and
Helensburgh. at Sausallto. and the West
gate, at present moored at the Risdon Iron.

on the Juries of award at St. Louis
would be sanctioned at St. Louis and
the additional uncertainties regarding
the time when the services of Jurors
would be reauirejl, the board adopted
the report of a committee that advised
against making: recommendations.
Assistant George A. Den
nison, who has been appointed secre
tary of the California Commission to
the St. Louis Exposition, was granted
leave of absence until the close of the
exposition.
The California State Board of Trade
yesterday adopted, on motion of Ar
thur R. Briggs, a preamble and reso
lutions urging upon the Secretary of
the Interior resolutions and statements
adopted by the Humboldt Chamber of
Commerce and the Supervisors of
Humboldt Countv relative to the Kla
math forest reserve. Past Grand Pres
ident McNoble of the Native Sons of
the Golden West also spoke in advo
cacy of receding to the federal Gov
ernment the Yosemite National Park
and the Mariposa grove of biff trees
and authorized the appointment of a
committee to consider the matter at
length. It was also voted to invite
Gifford Pinchot, chief of the Bureau
of Forestry of the Department of Ag
riculture, to address the board some
time next month relative to receding
the park and grove. The preamble and
resolutions relating to the wishes of
the Humboldt County people regarding
the Klamath forest reserve are as fol
lows:
Â¦\Vhcreas. The Board of Supervisors of Hum
bold County, acting In harmony with the
Humboldt Chamber of Commerce, has mib
mltted to the California State Boar* of Trade
a statement of facts !n respect to the injury
that would result to Humboldt and Trinity
counties from the establishment of a perma
nent forest reserve covering the district In
California known as the Klamath Forest Re
serve; and whereas, the presentation thus
made merits serious consideration from tbi3
body in view of the possible injury to the in
dustrial enterprise* already developed and the
obstruction such a reserve would offer to fur
ther development in these counties; it is
Resolved, That the California State Board
of Trade respectfully but very earnestly urges
the attention of the Department of the Inte
rior to the resolution and statement of faeta
hereto appended, with ihe suggestion to the
Interior Department that in the case of ex
isting: and proposed, reservations in the State,
the assurance ol the Government that It wilt
favor the use of all such natural resources aa
water r>ower and mining, when such use does
not Impair the purpose for which the reser
vation Is made, wl!l materially mitigate the
opposition to the reservation policy.
Resqlved. further. That the board recom
mends to Congress the passage of the bill now
pending in the Senate prepared by the Interior
Department and Bureau of Forestry.
The matter was discussed from va
rious points of view by "W. H. Mills.
Senator George C. Perkins, John P.
Irish and other members of the board.
Past Grand President McNoble de
voted some time to explaining his
views and those of the Native Sons of
the Golden "West regarding the reced
ing; of the Yosemite National Park and
the Mariposa grove to the care of the
United States. He said that the repre-
Eentatlves to the Grand Parlor of the
Native Sons have discussed the matter
and he found them to be practically
unanimous in favor of receding. Sev
eral members of the State Board of
Trade- spoke in favor of receding, but
it was considered wise to prolong the
discussion of the topic. On motion of
John P. Irishf the president of the
board was authorized to name a com
mittee. President Chipman will make
the appointments in a few days.

that it has been the practice not to sell
in quantities less than fifty sacks of
potatoes and twenty-five sacks of on
ions and that a trade agreement on
this basis was entered into on April 23
by the dealers.
Four restraining orders were granted
yesterday bv Presiding Judge Kerri
gan, temporarily preventing the Board
of Harbor Commissioners from inter
fering with the sales of produce on the
public wharves by dealers whose li
censes were revoked by the board on
August 3. After issuing the applica
tions for temporary injunctions the
presiding judge assigned the four cases
for trial before Judge Sloss on August
19.
The complainants against the Har
bor Commissioners are Webster &
Dunbar, G. B. Olcese, Jonas Erlangrer-
Davis Company and Schultz, Hansen
Company. Two other firms are said
to have been affected by the order of
August 3. J. B. Reinstein is attorney
for the dealers. Associated with him
is J. K. Johnson. In. each of the. four
complaints it is recited that the plain
tiffs obtained a permit to sell perish
able products upon the public wharves
and that the permit was not to be re
voked except upon a hearing before
the Board of Harbor Commissioners.
Notice was given them that upon July
2S the board had investigated the
charges of J. Lecari, upon which the
permits were later revoked.

Farnsworth Estate.
A petition for letters of administra
tion upoh the estate of Mrs. Minnie
Farnsworth. who died on August 8,
was filed yesterday by her daughter,
Lotta P. Farnsworth. who also applied
for letters of administration upon the
estate of her father, David L. Farns
worth. who died August 28. 1900.
FarnsVorth was a drayman and when
his widow administered his estate it
was worth more than $250,000. He
held valuable parcels of realty and
left it all to his wife and daughter.
A wife is the only extravagant habit
some men have.
Three children of J. Alexander Toell's
first wife have filed a contest against
his will, which left the bulk of his
$200,000 estate to his daughter, Mrs.
Evaline A. Levy. The contestants are
Gertrude Ellen Yoell, Beatrice Ethel
Yoell and Mrs. Emily F. Dunn. Their
attorney is John H. Yoell.
Yoell was a Santa Clara County pio
neer. He died last month at Highland
Springs. He had marled twice and
upon separating from his second wife,
Emily, he deeded half of his estate to
her. In his will he said that Mrs.
Levy, a daughter by the first wife, had
given him more attention and comfort
than all his other' children put to
gether. ;
Yoell was the father of two families
of children, who numbered ten in all.
After giving his last wife half of his
property he considered that she would
be able -to provide for her own chil
dren. For that reason he left nothing
to 'Mrs. Dunn nor to John H. Yoell,
who is attorney for the contestants. In
the case of .John, the father said that
his son had received money greatly in
excess of what he might expect from
the estate". The daughters Gertrude
'and Beatrice each received bequests of
$5000, but with this they are not satis
fled arid state in their .contest that at
the time of making his 'will, which was
dated January 27, 1904, their father
was not of sound mind and not com
: petent to execute a 'will.
LICK OBSERVATORY, Aug. 8.â The
accompanying . illustrations are from
photographs of the observing station of
the D. O. Mills expedition from the
Lick Observatory to the southern hem
isphere. The thirty-foot steel dome
contains the thirty-six-and-one-half
inch reflecting telescope, to which is
attached a powerful spectroscope. The
purpose of the expedition, which Mr.
Mills has generously financed, is to de
termine, by means of the spectroscope,
the motions of the naked-eye stars in
the one-fourth of the sky surrounding
the south pole of the heavens, which is
invisible from Mount Hamilton.
A determination of the motion of the
stars in the northern three-fourths of
the sky has been in progress at Mount
Hamilton continuously .since 1896 by
means of a large spectroscope- attached
to the thirty-six-inch equatorial. The
problem which it is proposed , to solve
by means of these observations is that
of the motion of oUr solar
through space, its direction and. speed.
The Mount ..Hamilton observations
already ' secured have enabled us to
make an approximate solution of. the
problem, but perfectly satisfactory re
sults cannot be- obtained until observa
tions have been made for the brighter
stars- distributed* over the entire sky.
Iflsexpectedthatthe Mills expedition
to the southern, hemisphere will have
secured the necessary observations at
the end of the year 1905.
: EXPEDITION. " (
The observing station is situated on
the summit ..of Mount San Cristobal, a
mountain 1000 feet high, lying in the
northeastern suburbs of the * city of
Santiago, Chile. ' The plain . on which
the city is buiit is 1800 feet .above the
sea level: " The altitude of the observa
tory, is, therefore, 2800. feet. .. Â¦ , Â¦
This expedition, in charge of Astron
omer. William H. r Wright,, assisted, by
Dr. H.-.K, Palmer* sailed.- from San
Francisco in February,. 1903. \ The ob
servatory instruments and buildings,
together with : an electric power line
running from the valley to the sum
mit, were installed in October, 1903.
The scientific work of the expedition
has been vigorously prosecuted since
that date. . .
The great reflector, and the spectro
scope have the efficiency which was
originally planned for j them and re
sults of great importance have been
secured very rapidly. Up to June 1,
19,04, more than 300, photographs of stel
lar spectra- have been obtained and
many of them have been measured and
reduced. The first \ consignment of
photographs from Chile was received
at Mount Hamilton a few weeks ago.
It is planned to have them measured
in the near future.
NEW STARS.
As by-products of these investiga
tions, Professor Wright has already
detected a number of spectroscopic
binary stars and other facts of especial
Interest: The binary, stars referred to
are those which appear to be single
stars even when viewed through the
most powerful telescopes, but the spec
troscopic observations of .their rnotions
prove that thev are attended *bv mas
sive invisible companions. >
The invisible- companions are large
enough to compel the brighter com
ponents of .the systems to revolve in el
liptic orbits, very much as the- earth
BY. W. W. CAMPBELL.
Since the purchase, no work of pres
ervation has been done at the mission
at Sonoma, which is fast falling to
ruin. Enough tiles were carried off
last Admission day to roof several feet
of the old corridor.
And the old oak in Montereyâ the
blessed old oak. under which the Car
melite friars chanted the mass in 1602,
eighteen years before the Pilgrims
came to Plymouth Rock, is dead, and
it died during the last year from wan
ton carelessness and neglect. But its
death lies at the doors of the people
of Monterey, : and to their shame let it
be said.
All this, however, merely goes to
show the evanescent nature of hopes,
and that the league must get busy and
hustle for the $1000 it needs to put the
roof on old San Antonio.
To be sure, Mr. Robert is readv with
an explanation of "Mr. Hearst's refusal
to keep faith with the advisory com
mittee. He says that Mr. Hearst be
lieves that if sufficient effort be put
forth by the Examiner the $1300 could
be raised to $3000â the sum needed to
buy the old theater in Monterey.
Now. here is a proposition to buy
something that nobody wants. It has
absolutely no historic value (Jennie
Lind, who is reputed to have sung
there, never saw it) and at $3000 it is
rated at about a dollar per 'dobe. Now,
granted that the money could be
raised, the Legislature could never be
induced to take it over as State proper
ty, as it is not a sane proposition.
The three properties purchased last
year now stand in the name of Mr.
Hearst, as trustee for California, pend
ing the session of the Legislature, al
though it was explicitly stated at the
time that the temporary' title would be
vested in the league.
As the funds were gathered these
really worthy and historic places were
purchasedâ and for this let California
be truly grateful!
But then there came a slump in
landmarks. The dollars dribbled in
slowly and then stopped short, leaving
in the Hearst safe an unused $1300.
This is the cash the committee wantsâ
but can't getâ to finish the league's
work. Now, wouldn't that jar you,
after reflecting upon that statement of
May 9: 'The advisorv committee to co
operate with the Examiner in regard,
to the use of the landmarks fund is
composed," etc.?

The case was heard before Justice
of the Peace Quinn and Kriske was
convicted and sentenced to serve sixty
days in the County Jail. Detective
Silvey, who had charge of the case
against Loudick, could not find Kriske
to subpena him as a witness at the
trial and after investigation discovered
that he was in jail. He laid the facts
before Captain Martin and, acting on
the captain's instructions, Silvey went
to the Oakland prison on Monday night
and brought Kriske to the city prison
here. Kriske testified yesterday.
Detective Silvey says that Mrs.
Kriske is applying for a divorce from
her husband and that the lawyer who
represents her told him he had per
sonally seen Justice Quinn before the
trial of Kriske and had urged that the
young man get the limit. Silvev says
It looks to him as if there had been a
conspiracy to keep Kriske from testify
ing against Loudick. Â¦ the Dis
trict Attorney was . informed of the
facts yesterday he said he would make
a thorough investigation. â¢ Â¦ â¢ \
There are some peculiar features
connected with the case which the Dis
trict Attorney will investigate. Kriske
was held up by Loudick in Berkeley
last October. Loudick was arrested,
but Influence was brought to bear upon
Kriske and he disappeared. As a re
sult, the charge against Loudick was
dismissed. It was owing to Kriske
having Loudick arrested that Loudick
stabbed him* last March.
Kriske's mother lives at 3539 Ells
worth street, Berkeley, and owns some
property. Her daughter and son-in
law, named Hagrer, live with her. On
Monday, August 1, Kriske, who is not
in favor with his mother, called to see
her. He rang the door bell and Hager
opened an upper window and asked
him what he wanted. He replied that
he wanted to see his mother and Ha
ger said she was not at home. Kriske
said he knew she was at home and he
wrote a note to her which he shoved
under the door. He again rang the
bell and sat on the front steps, deter
mined to see his mother. Hacer went
for Constable Howard and Kriske was
arrested for disturbing: the peace.
Paul Loudick, alias Paul Rudeck,
was convicted by a jury in Judge Law
lor's court yesterday afternoon on a
charge of assault to murder. He was
ordered to appear for sentence on Sat
urday. He stabbed William Kriske in
the abdomen in a saloon on Broadway,
near Hinckley alley, on the night of
March 6.

Representing- the Native Sons of the Golden

The following (dated May 1, 1903) is
a verbatim copy of the Examiner's
proclamation of the appointment of the
advisory committee and its . utilities
and will explain the shock some of the
members have sustained by Mr.
Hearst's refusal to pass over that fund
which is not working â while they lie
awake nights trying to find a way to
put a roof on the old San Antonio:
An advisory committee, composed of the
principal officers of the California Landmarks
League and the Grand President of the Native
Sons of the Golden West and the Grand Presi
dent of the Native Daughters of the Golden
West. -has been -chosen to co-operate with the
Examiner in carrying: out the details of the
work for the preservation of the State's land
marks. The members are:
MATTER OF RECORD.
But unhappily the hopes of the opti- i
mists received a hard jolt when it was ;
announced a few days ago by Dent i
Robert, managing editor of the Exam- \
iner, that such disposition of the idle !
landmarks fund does not meet the ap- ,
proval of William Randolph Hearst â j
and that settles it. ;
Now, this announcement has . given '
something of a shock .to the Cheerful j
Workers, for they well remember the â¢
circumstances under which the land- j
marks fund was raised. And it all
happened thus: ;
The Landmarks League, organized !
in June, 1902, had begun an active cam- â¢
paign that the historic structures of the j
State be not permitted to fall to decay. Â¦
and although twenty years too late to i
save some of the lesser old missionsâ i
the oldest structures in all the Westâ â¢
the work prospered, principally
through the generosity of the Native
Sons of the Golden West, who presented
to the league a lump sum of $1100. >
Then came the Examiner into the '
field with the patriotic purpose of do- !
ing just what the league had set out â¢
to do. Promptly and gratefully the '
officers of the league accepted the help
offered by the Examiner and there was \
not a member of the board of direct
ors that didn't "work overtime and
Sundays" to help build up that fund â
even to contributing: $1000 gleaned at
the school children's festival at the
Chutes in May.
Some days previous to this affair Mr.
Robert conferred with the officers of
the league and requested that an. ad
visory committee be formed from
among us, whose business it would be
to designate from a long list which
buildings and sites should be pur
chased. Some of the buildings on this
list, by the way, were of such a fic
titious value â historically and com
mercially â as to preclude serious con
slderation.
By Laura Bride Powers. :
The California Historic Landmarks
League is preparing to issue circular |
letters to its friends for sufficient funds j
to complete the restoration of the beau- !
tiful old Mission of San Antonio de
Padua in Monterey County, whose an- |
cient walls are now completely rebuilt, \
although naught but the blue sky j
stetches above them â naught save a lit- :
tie patch of shakes laid last fall before j
work was suspended.
It had been secretly hoped by many !
of the lovers of the old Missionsâ both in
and out of the Landmarks League â
that the appeal for funds could be
avoided, conscious that $1300 of the
landmarks fund raised in May of 1903
by the Examiner remains unexpended
in the safe. And as there is no proba
bility of any further purchases of his- ;
toric buildings in Monterey, principally
because there are no more worth pur- I
chasing and perpetuating at public ex- j
pense, it was hoped that the money
lying idle in the Examiner's safe could
be obtained for the , important work of
restoration being carried on at Mission
San Antonio â of which, by the way, the
league holds a ten-year lease, with the
promise of renewal at its expiration.
HOPES BADLY JARRED. \
After a career of dissipation ending in
(.rime. Second Lieutenant Lewis C.
Hamilton. U. S. A., disgraced and hope
less, has been adjudged insane and com- -
m'.tted by the Washington authorities
to an asylum. United States District
Attorney Marshall B. Woodworth was
yesterday advised of this fact, and by
order of the Attorney General be entered f
a nolle prosequi in the United States
District Court yesterday, whereupon ;
the- indictment against Hamilton was j
prdered dismissed.
Hamilton was formerly 6econd lieu
tenant in the Light Artillery Corps. He
was arrested in Washington. D. C. in
the latter l>art of August. 1903. charged
with forging the pay account of Lieu
tenant Claude E. Brigham of the Sec
ond Light Artillery Corps. For this
Hamilton was indicted in Washington.
He resigned from the army on Febru
ary 4, 1904. Having transferred his pay
accounts for November and December
to Louis Silverman of New York, he
presented duplicates to the paymaster
at Manila and drew the money on
them. He also drew from Colonel
Dodge the money called for by a
forged pay account of Lieutenant "W.
S. Bowen, Coast Artillery. The forged
pay account of Lieutenant Bowen for
the month of June. l?03, was sold by
the accused to Charles H. Morrell, a
loan agent in the Hearst building. At
about the same time Lieutenant Hamil
ton contracted a large bill at the Occi
dental Hotel and its barroom annex,
and he passed off upon the proprietor
in payment therefor the pay account
of Lieutenant Bruce Cotton for the
month of May. A duplicate of the same
p'ay account he presented to Major
Payson at the Presidio and received
the money on it.
At the outbreak of the Spanish-
American war Hamilton enlisted as a
private in one of the New York volun
teer regiments:. He was assigned for
duty in the Signal Corps and was at
once promoted to be a corporal. He
held the rank of sergeant when he was
mustered nut. In July, 18S9, he enlisted
in the regular army as a private in
Company E. Fourteenth Infantry. He
was made a corporal of the Signal
Corps until he received his commission
as lieutenant on July 1, 1931.
