Fight Battle in Town

BAKU. Sept. s.â Troops, under" the di- '
rcction of .the Governor, are acting with
the'irtmost vigor, bat theynrpe Kot'Bnc-
ceeded in restoring order, although there
is rather less. firing.
Armed rioters to-day attacked tne oil
works in the suburb of Balakhan, and,
. after a hct tight, set fire to them.
Tartar bands are scouring the coun
try, murdering and pillaging.
The country is in a state of wild panic
and houses and farms are being aban
doned. The famine in many districts ren
ders the situation more terrible.
ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. 5.â A dis
patch from Tiflis received to-day says:
"The whole of the Southeast Caucasus
is now terrorized by Tartars. Refugees
are pouring in here from Baku, Eliza-
L'lthpo! and Sbusha.
"Details from Shusha snow that sev
eral engagements were fought between
Tartars and Armenians behind regular,
positions and that a considerable part of
the town was soon in flames.
"According to an official estimate, more
than 200 houses were destroyed."
The Minister of Finance has received a
telegram from the governing committee
of the Bourse at Xljni Novgorod urgent
ly appealing to him to adopt immediate
measures for the re-establishment of
crder at Baku.
The disturbances of yesterday were
marked by immense property losses,
â¢which fall with crushing weight on the
Russian oil industry centered at Baku.
The combatants resorted to the torch, as
the result of which hundreds of tanks of
oil. naptha and a number of important
and its vicinity are now in
'flames. Oil men here are unable to esti
mate the loss while the conflagration
continues, but believe that it will run
ir.to millions of dollars in Baku alone.
The lire, which commenced in the refin
eries of the Moscow-Caspian Society, ac
cording to private reports, spread to 300
tanks and to one tank in the "black
town" quarter containing 5,000,000 pounds
of oil.
At Biebat, near Baku, the works of the
Mantaschell Company, among the most
important in Russia, and the works of
the TiflSs Society are. on fire. Refineries;
et Xomanl and Sabunto have been de
stroyed.
The oil men have telegraphed to Em
peror Nicholas, imploring the protection
of the Government and asking for as-
Fistsince to prevent- the complete destruc
tion of their properties In the Baku dis
trict, "which give to the state 100,000,000
roubles in revenue and furnish heat and
lipht to Russia."
The blow will be felt all the* heavier
through Russia, as there lis already a
great scarcity, of oil for fuel purposes.

HONOLULU. Sept. 6.â The steamship

ports a 1"a 1 " large volcanic outbreak on the
island of Savaii,* In I the I Samoa n group,
which, it is stated, Is' very extensive. The
outbreak is ten miles south of Matautu
and has created a new mountain esti
mated to be nearly 1000 feet high.
'The lava flows from the base of this
mountain a distance or , several .' miles.
Travelers report that five or six hills are
moving apparently on lava foundations.
Some have advanced several miles from
their starting place, indicating a vast
molten lava area beneath.
Ernest Neill and George Furlong, who
visited the scene, say that many million
tons of lava are. being ejected. .The
hills are now moving very slowly and the
lava is solidifying on the surface. This
will eventually stop their further
progress, which threatened much fertile
territory. The natives have held gather
ings and had decided to abandon the
threatened towns, but, having become as
sured that there is no danger of loss of
life, they are settling down again.
MRS. OELRICHS
NO LONGER FAT
Leader of Newport Set Wins
War Long Waged Against
an Increasing Adiposeness
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« C*;l
NEW YORK. Sept. 6. â Mrs. Herman
Oelrichs, one of the leaders of the New
port set, has conquered in the war
she has been waging against increasing
weight. - From' a stout matron she has
transformed, herself -. into â¢\u25a0 the figure \of
a girl, but only after; years of patient
effort and : grim determination.
When Miss Theresa Fair flrst i came
to New York as the bride of : Herman
Oelrichs, in ; the early nineties, she ; was
a reed of slendernesV but luxurious
life soon began to manifest its effect in
a form of increasing weight. 1 Her
figure gradually lost its graceful pro
portions. Five- years ago she weighed
175 pounds. She was so stout that fit'
was common - gossip \u25a0 that her diamond
collar was enlarged by a panel of dia
monds in order to' fit her growing
throat. Suddenly Mrs. Oelrichs an
nounced she would, reduce hcr^' figure
and began with the all-meat cure. She
ate meat only. It_.was- not' a\ success
and she went abroad to try! the steam
baths of Bad Nauhelm.
The German cure had only,' a fleet
ing. effect and while she lost a few
pounds, she gained them again during
the gay season at ; Newport. She: tried
several other cures, but -they failed "to
reduce her weight. "Then she changed
to," vigorous.' walking.- and f resh \u25a0'\u25a0/- air,
"which had the, best", effect "of ..all/ .': She
has:, now ..managed/ to get her.fweight
down : to 130 pounds. Mrsl Oelrichs;, is
eating/ sparingly.. She seldom drinks
"more than â¢a ; sip '_ of Â« water and i cham
pagne, both, of which are flesh produc
ers. .Her. chief diet consists of 'fish,
simply prepared.

names of other legislators similarly fa
vored.
It is said by some politicians who can
come-pretty near ta- drawing a correct,
map of the trail taken by every dollar
Of boodle money at Sacramento that this
latter scare comes from the fact that |
a prominent State official received $6000 i
from an Oakland syndicate to secure j
some favors with from the Bunkers' ln T \u25a0
vestigating syndicate, and that he kept'
the whole sum. telling, the Bunkers out- |
fit that its sudden disruption had made "it
necessary \u25a0 for him to return It to the
Oakland company, and telling the latter ;
that me had given it to the boodlers and
that their sudden exposure had prevented
them taking action. ;
Then it- is said that . two well-known \
railroad lobbyists, one from â¢ iÂ«e north,
and one from -the south, are exposed in
the Bunkers confession. The. charges '
made against them. It is said, cover
both the session of 1903 and 1905. ;
It is only' the alleged confessions con
cerning boodling and other crooked tran
sactions of' the sessions of 190S->that are
worrying those who fear they are named.
The transactions of the session of 1903 1

all testimony concerning them would be
hazy now and the statute of limitations
could probably be pleaded. â¢â¢:\u25a0" -/i
KO PROMISE OF PARDOX.
Dispatches from Sacramento concerning
Bunkers confession state that it was
made by the expelled Senator without
any promise cf pardon and gives some of
Bunkers language as' follows:
"Joe Jordan came in after the â¢'investi
gation resolution had been published and ;
offered' his assistance as a collector from
the various corporations to be attacked. :
French at first objected to Jordan, but :
accepted him en the understanding that
he was not to be tet in on anything else
and would work on a commission. Jor
dan, after he and I had made the trip I
to the city, said $350 could be obtained !
for each of us for immunity to the Rent- !
ers and the Phoenix, he to receive $250 !
commission clear. ' French said it was
too llttie'and Wright saiH. *I am here
to take anything; anything thai hasn't
rouis down so deep that I can't pull
it U2>." \u25a0 ':':;
"Ttiere was a< long discussion as to how i
the *ihbney should be paid us," and we !
foolishly' gave in to the demand of the
agerir, Tlchenor,- that he should see it
paused, li was paid to me and Emmons
exactly t s narrated by. Jordan."
Here Bunkers tell? of the telephoning
to Cerbln, anrt continues: . . â¢\u25a0\u25a0â¢
"We heW a-.neetlng after the members
not ia the deal had departed and decided
that there was something wrong, or Cor
bin would not have -been so ready to
fight. We would have quit on him then,
but we did not want to break with the
Examiner over the matter at that time.
"On the day the Senate met to consider
the alleged contempt of Corbin we grew
suspicious, because he looked so cooL Jor
dan leaned over and said to me Just as
Corbin and ICicol took the platform.
â¢There is something wrong.'.. When the
Corbin .affidavit was read we were- too
frightened to take any action whatever.
We 'were j afraid to get together in the
afternoon, fearing' we were watched, but
all of us excepting French -.met at Em
mons'; room in the State House in the
evening.
"Jordan there 'made his proposition to
gather all the bills together and turn
the suw over to the Senate committee,
with the statement that none of we four
had received a cent and that he was try
ing to trap the building and loan compa
nies.' \u25a0 .r-- r .
" Then we'll have Corbin and McNab in
a hole and will demand their arrest,' he
eaid. 'I must come out with something,
thought he said, "and you fellows must
laise J2&00 on the side for me.*
WHERE IS THE $I4OOf
"We all agreed to this, and Arthur Lee,
the colored man. was selected to carry
the money to Hanlon's safe and have It
locked up. French 6ent his In separately.
James Copeland went there to count the
coin-^andâ see -that Jt was deposited. Me- \
fore this I had discovered that my pile
was.- ssftÂ£hott. : and" aÂ£ the -adVice of* the;
others I made Jordan cough .up. \u0084
"VTithin a day or two we were plunged
into ; discussions and bickerings, and we
all distrusted Jordan. 'We* "decided not to
give" him the $3000, coming to,the conclu
sioÂ£ that Jfjihe- got thÂ« 5400 bones, he
would slide with aJI.-bf. It.'* French was es^ ,
pedally oppoeod to letting: him get hijs j

ex-Sepatcr Seymour of San Bernardino,
and said she had given It to him to put in
a piece where it would do no harm in evi
dence. 1 asked him if this was a fact, and
he 'said yes." "
There will be some hearts- thumping till
Monday in face of , all the rumors and
Bunkers" evident ability to give up facts
when he once gets started. Even if all

are* not in his confession. , he may have

calm and stoutly /maintains his lnno-.

have his trial at once and says that
there could be nothing in the Bunkers
confession to implicate him.,
"To my... mind,".. said Emmons,.. "the
purported confession is an evidence of
weakness on the part of â the prosecu
tion. If they had the testimony'neces
sary to prove the charges against me
there would' be ho need 0f ... offering.
Bunkers a pardon for further evi

Mr. Emmons leaves for Sacramento

.. Mrs. Emmons said: "All this"' talk
about my having received that money
and having it In my possession at any
time has . no foundation. ' I don't be
lieve that Mr. Bunkers ever said that
I was, the custodian, of that / money,
and If he has said so in his confession
I will be only too glad to face him in a

Greeting 4 Mr. Littlefield
BERLIN, Sept. 5. â Emperor "William
received Congressmen Littlefleld of
Maine. Bartholdt of Missouri, Waldo or
New York, McNary of Massachusetts.
Norris of Nebraska- and Barchfeld of
New York to-day. The Emperor sent
court carriages for. them and they were
assigned to positions next to the im
perial suite at the autumn review of
the Potsdam and Berlin garrisons at
Templehof Field. Secretary Dodge of
the American Embassy, and a repre
sentative of the Foreign Office, accom
panied them. At the Emperor's sug
gestion. Mrs. Waldo. Mrs. Bartholdt,
Mrs. MqNary and Mrs. Barchfeld were
in carriages next to their husbands, .
but not in court equipages.
The Congressmen, who have been at
tending the meeting of the Internatlon
lal Parliamentary Union at Brussels,
I were driven after the parade la the
; train of the Empress through the
j streets to the Palace. The Emperor
marched over the same route at the
head of a regiment. When the Emperor
! entered the hall where the party
; awaited him he spoke to Dodge and
said: .
"Introduce me to these gentlemen."
His- Majesty "talked with each mem
ber of the party and to the Congress
men-collectively. To Barchfeld, who is
about six feet six inches in height, he
â¢aid: â¢ : -\u25a0 â¢
"If you were a German I would have '
you in my guards."
A variety of subjects were 'touched*
upon during the audience and -the 'Em-'?'
peror earnestly complimented his visi- â¢\u25a0
tors on President Roosevelt's peace
work, referring to it much as he did
to Congressman "William Alden SmitH
of Michigan, on Saturday. v
Some one- spoke of traveling; in Ger
many and said he thought the German.
railroads shook more than the Ameri- -
can. -':.,-'.
"Perhaps so." said the Emperor; "that- ,
Is because' we cannot afford to. have:,
the. ties so close .together."
Mr.- Bartholdt, as chairman . of the \u0084
American delegates to the Brussels con
vention, said to â¢ the Emperor that . the
Congressman regarded the audience as
a compliment to the United States and,
'' not as a personal one to them.
His Majesty, in parting . with >the
American visitors, said he hoped, they
would not. fail to give. his best, wishes
to the President. '. ~ -
The Lokal . Anzelger describes Em
peror William and the Congressmen as
Joking together." "
"You are from the State of cyclones,"
said the Emperor â¢to ' Mr. Littlefield. â¢
"Oh. no. your Majesty, they coma
from Mr. Norris' State. Nebraska," said
Mr. Littlefleld. . ;>
"'Nebraska/'^ said 1 Mr. Norris,"-ener
getically. : "has the ! most' fruitful \u25a0 soil â¢
in the world 'and the loveliest climate."
The Emperor, talking serionsry, al- â¢
luded to the* world situation tollovring â¢

had observed':; with satisfaction that,

BY THE RUSSO-JAPANESE ENVOYS
With the signing of the treaty of, Portsmouth yesterday, the war'fcetween Russia and Japan passed
into history. The ceremony was simple, ending with an exchange of felicitations by "the envoys, and at its
conclusion a salute was fired at the United States navy yard.

Salute by the Naval
Guns Announces
the News.
PORTSMOUTH, X. H., Sept. s.â The
treaty of Portsmouth was signed shortly
before .4 o'clock this afternoon, in the
' conference room of the navy general store
at the navy yard. The firing of a nation
al salute of nineteen guns was the signal
\u25a0which told the people of Portsmouth,
Kittery and Newcastle that the peace of
Portsmouth was an accomplished fact,
and the church bells in the three towns
were soon ptaling forth a joyful refrain.
For forty-eeven minutes those outside
the conference room anxiously awaited
the signal. Suddenly an orderly dashed
to the entrance of the peace building and
waved his hand to the gunner a few feet
away, and the opening shot of the salute
rang out on the clear air of the soft Sep
tember afternoon, proclaiming peace be
tween Russia and Japan.
Three o'clock was the hour set for the
final session of the conference. An hour
before that time a iuavy thunderstorm
was in progress, but as Mr. de Witte and
Baron Rosen left the hotel in an automo
r \:ie at 2:15 o'clock for the navy yard the
rain stopped. When Baron Komura and
Mr. Takabira entered their automobile
twenty minutes later, the sun suddenly
ehone, which called forth the remark
from Baron Komura:
'â¢It is a good omen for peace."
This remark was cheer* d by the crowd
gathered to see the Japanese depart.
SALUTES FOR THE ENVOYS.
The Russian plenipotentiaries reached
the yard at a quarter of 3 and received
an EmbiiEEadorial salute of nineteen
g-ur.s. The yarfi presented a lively scene
as the automobile bearing Mr. de Witte
ami Baron Rosen dashed up to the con
ference building. On one side, in spe
cial full dress, were two companies \u25a0of
marines commanded by Major Moses,
who rendered the prescribed honors as
Mr. de \\'itte and _aron Rosen passed
t-heir fronts yrifr.
Grouped in front of the conference hall
were a body of correspondents, who had
bc*n admitted to the navy yard at the
special request of Mr. de Witte, and they
gave him a hearty cheer as he alighted
from his automobile and was greeted in
the vestibule by Mr. Peirce. the Third
Assistant Secretary of State, Admiral
MÂ«ad, commandant of the yard, and Com
mander Cameron McR. winslow, com
manding the Mayflower, and the five mid
shipmen who were ordered here for duty
in .connection with the peace conference.
The midshipmen were: Harrington. Bag
ley, Blackburn. Jngersol and Leary, who
appeared in special uniform" dress.
Tke Russians wAt at once to their
private offices adjoining the conference
r romr '0m to await the arrival of the Japa

until 3 o'clock.
Baron Komura and Mr. Takahira also
were saluted with nineteen guns as they
entered the yard. They were ushered at
once to the Japanese office at the east
end of the conference room. Then the
Russian secretaries immediately came
over and began the comparative reading
of the Russian and Japanese copies,'
which required about twenty minutes.
Upon the completion of this task, they
prepared the two copies of the protocol
of the final sitting, leaving only the
exact hour to be filled in.

It was Just 3:45 o'clock when the pleni
potentiaries entered the conference room
from their respective offices. They merely
bowed to one another and took their
accustomed seats at the long table around
DR. PIKRCE'S REMEDIES?
IT GURE
That's the personal question a woman
aÂ«ks herseif when she reads of the cures
of womanly diseases by the use of Dr.
Pierces Favorite Prescription.
iWhy shouldn't it cure her?
Is it a complicated case? Thousands
of such cases have been cured by "Fa-
vorite Prescription." Is it a condition
which local doctors have declared In-
curable? Among the hundreds of thou-
sands of sick women cured by the use of
Dr. Plercft's Favorite Prescription .there
are & great many who were pronounced
incurable by local * doctors. Wonders
have been worked by " Favorite Pre-
scription" in tho cure of irregularity,
weakening drains, inflammation, ulcera-
tion and female weakness. It always
helps. It almost always cures.

which their 'negotiations have \ been con
ducted. Instead of the secretaries sitting
next to the plenipotentiaries, however,"
these chairs were occupied by the re
maining, delegates. Mr. de Witte sat at
the center of the "table, facing the win
dow. On his right was Baron Rosen and
Captain Roussaine, the latter' occupying
the seat of Mr. de Maartens, who was
detained at the hotel by an indisposition.
On Mr. de Witte's.left sat Mr. Pokotlloff
and General Yermaloff.
Directly opposite Mr. de Witte was
Baron Komura t with Mr. Takahira and
Mr. Sato on his right, and Mr. Dennison
and Mr. Yamaza on his left. At one end
of the table sat Mr. Plancon, with the
Russian originals of the treaty in French
and English and the final protocol.
Grouped around the table were the
other members of the two missions and
the Invited witnesses, Mr. Peirce, the
Third Assistant Secretary of State, as the
personal representative of the* President;
Admiral Mead, commandant, of the navy
yard: Captain . Winslow, commanding the
Mayflower, the Governor of New Hamp
shire and the Mayor of Portsmouth.
As soon as the delegates had taken their,
seats, Mr. Sato left his chair and went
to Mr. de Witte's side with the Japanese
copies of the treaty, which he placed :
before him. At the same time Mr. Plan- ;
con placed the Russian copies of the i
treaty before Baron Komura.
SIGNATURES ARE ATTACHED.
Almost at the same moment the two
envoys selected pens from the center of
the table and signed their names, first
to thÂ« French and then to the English
text. The copies were then signed by
Baron Rosen and Mr. Takahira. . Mr.
Sato returned the Japanese copies for
the signatures of Baron Komura and Mr.
Takahira. Mr. de Witte and Baron Rosen
affixed their signatures to the Russian
copies and thetreaty of Portsmouth was
signed, .the cert mony being completed at
8:50 o'clock. . â¢,
To this moment no word had broken'
the silence of the room. Throwing his
j pen aside, Mr. de Witte, without a
I word, reached across the table and
grasped Baron Komura's hand. His
conferrecs followed, and the Russian
and Japanese officials remained for a
moment Jn silence, their right' hands
tlsrhtly clasped across the conference
table. - <
The war was over! Russia and Japan
were once more friends! V
This simple ceremony rang true and

KOMURA REPLIES FEELINGLY.
Baron Komura replied that he shared
entirely the views of Baron Rosen. The
treaty of peace which; they had signed
was in the interest of humanity, and
civilization, and he was happy to be
lieve that It would ; bring; about a firm,
lasting peace between two, neighboring
empires. \u25a0'\u25a0_'*
He- added that it would always be
pleasant for him to -recall' that,
throughout the long, and serious nego
tiations, which: they had now : left be
hind, he and his colleagues had invari
ably^ received from* theÃussian pleni
potentiaries high courtesyj and consid
eration, and finally he begged to. as
sure the Russian plenipotentiaries' that
it would'be his duty as 'well "-as his
pleasure to do everything in his ; power
to'make the treaty In fact what" it pro

MOSCOW, Sept.- 6.â The .executive
committee of the Zemstvo and Donma
congress adopted a resolution to-day
not to boycott the national assembly,
but, on the contrary, to take as active
a part as possible in the election. The

Indicates a probable alignment of the
two : elements In the \u25a0 electoral college.
Prlnoe Troubetskoy, marshal of the
Moscow nobility, in an interview speaks
highly of the national assembly pro
ject, saying- it is an Important step in
the historical evolution of Russia and
a carefully prepared . compromise be
tween the f demands of the different
parties..- The plan, he adds, is open
to | improvement, ] but , the , pledge in , the
imperial manifesto shows the need
thereof. â¢ , . . ... , .
;. Discussing . the Jewish .question,
Prince .Troubetskoy says it must be ap
proached with the greatest care. The
removal of \u25a0 the ; restrictions on resi
dence would be dangerous, in view, of
the backwardness of the Russian peas
antry, as -the residence of, . Hebrews
among them would menace' state Inter
ests. He concludes with rebuking the
revolutionary: activity of : the Jews, de
daring that it is the duty of .every
citizen to work for the pacification of
Russia.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. B. C; Sept. 5. â Seal
Raider _ McLean with his now famous
schooner Carmencita is at Clayouquet,
on the west coast of Vancouver Island,
\u25a0where he put in on Sunday afternoon
\u25a0with a crew bordering on mutiny. A
portion of his catch of sealskins is un
der seizure hv the Canadian customs
authorities at this port, and hurrying
from Port Angeles to apprehend- the
schooner if she shows her nose out
side the three-mile limit is one of the
vessels of the United States Pacific
squadron now visiting Port Angeles.
Such sums up the situation at mid
night in- what has been an exciting
day along the water front, when the
news of the arrival of men from the
schooner by the Queen City gained cir
culation around the city. The skins
6eired by Collector Newbury number
373. The men say they were caught in
Bering Sea in ordinary fashion. 1 .They
insist there was no raid. The small
number of skins they brought home
confirms this.
They also say that Captain Alexander
McLean was not in charge of the expedi
tion. Captain Thomas was master of the
vÂ«=*sel and McLean was navigator. Cap
tain Thomas died on August 22 when en
route 1Â»ome from Bering Sea and was
buried at sea on the following day. He
contracted a bad cold when the vessel
started home, which gradually became
worse and he finally died.
When United States Consul A. E. Smith
heard of the arrival of the Carmencita at
Clayouquet he at once advised Rear Ad
miral Goodrich, now at Port Angeles, by
telegraph.
The men will be examined by Collector
of Customs Newbury to-morrow. McLean
has removed the name Carmencita from
the stem and painted thereon "Acapul
co." Mrs. STcLean is evidently in Victoria,
as the telegraph office has a message for
her which they cannot deliver, as they
do not know her address. Some think
Captain McLean may come to Victoria.
"It was because we got a Victoria Colo
nist of June 19 from the Alice Knowles, a
whaling vessel out of San Francisco,
when in Bering Sea that we decided to
come home," said one of the sealers.
"We read in the paper that an indict
ment was out for Captain McLean, and
we decided to quit and come home."

GAIETY PLAY
SHOCKS STEAD
Veteran Writer flakes Fiery
Attack on New Musical
Play "The Spring Chicken"
PIECE IS BIG SUCCESS
Critic Declares That It Is a
Parra^o of Filth and With
out Redeeming Feature
Special Disratch to The Call
LONDON, Sept. 5. â With next to noth
ing to doâ though a deal preparingâ at
the playhouses here, little is being talked
of. in London theatrical circles but the
fiery attack which W. T. Stead made in
his Review oY Reviews on "The Spring
Chicken," the musical play from the
French, which. George Edwardes present
ed at the Gaiety. The piece is.to.be pro
duced in the United States before long,
fo Americans will be able to decide for
themselves whether Stead is justified in
the headline which he uses for his
"roast." which is "Gomorrah at the
Gaiety." . . . * .
As a matter of fact, the author, of "If
Christ Came to Chicago" is a trifle 'late
in the day with his denunciation, ' for
"The Spring Chicken" has been running
in the , Strand for three months or. more
and is one of the biggest successes in
town. Stead, however, explains his tardi
ness. He says that as he' did -not '.wish'
to be prejudiced against the play by see
ing it at its worst from an ethical point'
of view,. he has hitherto given the famous
Gaiety a wide berth. It will be remem
bered that Stead started out to get his
first impression of the modern playhouse
i only a few months ago, and that he was
badly shocked at the beginning by
: Pinero's "Wife 1 Without a Smile," of
which he wrote that he had been made
to "laugh at hell." 'hi-'-J;i:h i -'-J;i:
PM)T IS FAIRLY COHERENT.
Owing perhaps to its French origin, the
attraction at the London Gaiety has a
fairly coherent plot. It gets its title from
its hero. A young Parisian advocate
married. He is a model benedict during
the summer, winter anfl fall, but In the
spring his fancy turns to love in such a
determined fashion that , business and
home "ties alike are set 'at naught, while
he disports himself on the primrose path.
At the beginning of the' playâthe spring
being' then approachingâ we see him en
gaged in planning a little trip abroad for
his 'wife in order that his gayetles may
be unimpeded. On the scene,- however,
arrives the young wife's- mother, who of
fers her daughter valuable counsel. There
is only one way, the mother observes, to
clip the wings of such a "spring chicken"
âthat is "by means of a sleeping powder.
She has tried It with excellent results
with her own lord, who used to be "just
the same"â the thing, we learn, having
been accomplished by surreptitiously
sprinkling the powder over his food. She
advises her daughter to adopt similar
methods, and the young wife does so.
Meanwhile the barrister has made ah
evening appointment with one of- his fair
clients, a Countess. He is attempting to
gain a divorce for her from her husband.
The lawyer and the lady are to meet at a
not too austere res.taurant on the out-
ekirts of Paris, whÂ£re they are to have
supper. Of course.' the'-Bwaiii," affected \u25a0by
the drug, drops off to sleep, and equally,
of course, the much^relied on potion gets
in its work on the wrong persons "_later irr
the play with laughable results, j Mean-,
v-'hile matters the restaurant are made
still livelier by; the arrival " there_ of 'the
.young wife's 'fatherâ the first object'pf.
the "powder cure"^ln company with the
family \u25a0 housemaid^ who .has previously,
explained in thVcourse of a song that life
in the French provinces" 1 being oversedate,
she has "Just Come Up to Paris for a
Change.". .. \;Â» v
SAYS PLAY" IS'" FRI VOLOI) S.
Stead describes all this as a "pesti
lent and pestiferous farrago of, filth,"
and he goes on' to speak of the ''pro
miscuous animalism" which reigns su
preme on the stage of the Gaiety and
declares that the whole thing is "one
long presentation of lust, unredeemed
by. a single spark of sentiment." He
adds: "It is evil to the last 'degree.
Every one is pawing with vice, hinting,
at lt.-grinnlng at it, indulging In it. It
is the morals of the cities of the plain
served' up in the Strand for the'delec
tation of the most moral, the most
virtuous community in the world." :
Of course, such a broadside has not
failed to draw Indignant and virtuous
disclaimers from the interested parties.
Edwardes, after declaring that there is
nothing whatever to. object to in tho
Gaiety piece, points out that "t" t there are
things fifty times worse .in Shakes
peare, while George Grossmith Jr., who
adapted "The Spring Chicken," affirms
that his play can be described as noth
ing worse than frivolous.
The wonder is that those responsible
for -this latest musical show have
thought it worth while to reply to
Stead's attack, or that even so" earnest
a person: as he should have done any
thing so futile as to make it, 'A Lon
don musical play can be suggestive up
to almost any limit so long as it is
tuneful and amusingâ both ;of which
"The Spring Chicken" is to a superla
tive degree. * It would have been: dif
ficult, for instance, "to \u25a0 tell. .the 'plot"- ot
"The Girl From Kay's", In a drawing^
room and I, for; one,- have seldom-seen
a Gaiety show that didn't contain 'at
least one song that was "uncomfort
able"' if one was accompanied- by {&
lady. London likes it.' American cities
are stricter about this sort of thing,
however, aÂ«d It will be Interesting to
see what the American critics have to
say about "The Spring Chicken."

IN TWENTY-FIRST CONVENTION.
California Report
Feature of the
. Opening Day.
Factories in This
State .Do Not
Work Babes.
Yesterday marked the opening of the
twenty-riret annual convention or the As
sociation of Officials of Bureaus of Labor
cf America. Representatives from seven
teen States have already gathered at the
meeting place in the St. Francis Hotel,
and many more are expected on late Kast
ern trains. The work of these men dur
ing the year Is the collection of reliable
statistics concerning the conditions of la
bor throughout the United States and
Canada and to report their success at the
annual convention. The Commissioners
are provided for by acts of the State Leg
islatures. There is a national office at
\u25a0Washington. It has been mainly through
Ite efforts that various labor laws, espe
cially those regarding the services of chil
dren, have been successfully passed and
afterward enforced.
This convention marks the \ passing of
Carroll D. Wright, for many years head
of the National Bureau of Labor at
Washington, who goes into a new field.
He has accepted a call to the presidency
of Clark University, and he. will resign
from the service. His loss to the Govern
ment will be a severe one, for he has
guided the efforts of the labor statisti
cians almost since the work was first in
stituted. He was expected to meet with
the association, of which he is the presi
dent, at this session, but "a severe cold
forced him to abandon the trip. Expres
sions of regret at the loss of this great
leader were everywhere heard among th*
delegates. His message to the convention
was read by Secretary W. L.. A. Johnson,
the Kansas Commissioner.
GOVERNOR PAROEG ILL. AT HOME.
The first address of welcome was to
have been given by Governor Pardee, who
is interested in the work' of the conven
tion, but illness prevented his attendance.
He^had prepared a ept-ech and had sent it
to Commissioner W. V. Stafford, but
through an error in mailing it did not
reach the convention in time to be read.
Mayor Schxnltz heartily expressed his
delight at being called upon to address
the Commissioners, and welcomed them
to the city. He praised the work they
had done and urged that they give a
greater publicity to their efforts in tt\e
future. Commissioner David Ross of IUI\
nois replied in a happy vein, paying a
high compliment to the many beautiful
California women whom he had seen on
the streets of San Francisco.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the
University of California said that the
statistics of the Commissioners were like
iceâ very much, needed in thÂ« heat of la
bor excitement. "Many of our labor trou
bles;" he said, "have occurred because
some one cot excited at the critical mo
ment. It is then that the ice. which in
these cases are the statistics, the truth
ful facts, is needed. Facts are usually
es dead as paving stones when they are
regarded as mere facts, but when' we put
human lnterÂ«st in them they become val
uable. That Is what these Labor Com
missioners are doincr, and their work
becomes of Inestimable value."
SPEAKS *X THE COST OP LIVING.
â¢ The principal addrees of the day was
made by Dr. C. C. Plehn. professor in
the University of California. The paper
was written on "The Cost of Llvine," a
subject closer to the laborers of the
world than any other. It is this subject
on which the association of officers of
the bureaus of labor are working hardest.
They are trying to find a system which
will chow the actual differences of living
expenses during hard times and during
the periods of prosperity. Do prices really
rise with wages, and do good times sim
ply mean continuous labof for the work
man? This is the Question which these
Commissioners are trying to solve. Pro
fessor Plehn's address caused much dis
cussion, as he took the stand that the
fluctuation of prices should be taken from
the books of the wholesalers and not the
small merchant. Many of the Commis
sioners thought that It was only through
the small dealers that the exact pur
chasing power of the wages of the work
man can be correctly estimated.
The resort .of Commissioner Stafford
on the progress of labor conditions in
California was very satisfactory. He
showed that there are practically no chil
dren now employed in the factories or
canneries of California during the school
terms. Moreover, he showed that a help-
Ing spirit had been engendered in the
hearts of the employers. He laid the
crowded conditions of the San Francisco
schools to the enforcement of the child
labor laws In California. . Quite the oppo
site was the report from Colorado, where
Commissioner E. ,V. Brake said that ev
erything 1 was being done to break down
the labor laws of that State. Reports were
rÂ»ad from every State in the Union.

GIVES REPORT OF C,tUFORXIA.
The report of Commissioner Stafford
on the conditions in California is as fol-
Ws: â¢
In IBS 3 Â» factory inspection act, was passed
putting this duty upon the liureau of Labor.
At the last session of tne legislature a new
child labor law was passed, raising the age at
rjhich children may be employed from 12 to
14 years; putting restrictions on all minors
under IS as regards number or hours employed;
requiring certification of all minors between 14
and 16; prohibiting all minors under 16 from
working after 10 o'clock at night, and requir
ing school attendance of -all Illiterate minors
up to 16 years of age. In enforcing this law
the ecl:col authorities are made responsible for
the certification, and the bureau has caused all
the rxccrMTj.' blanks to be printed and placed
In lhÂ» har.rts. of the school principals througn
out thÂ« State. The law is being generally ob
sen ed-
Factory inspection is- being carried on,, and
data on Individual wages is being collected;
carnation and proper sureguardlng of ma
chinery is being looked to. .. '
A complete roster of the labor unions has
been prepared; the number and condition of the
members, amount of life insurance, sick and
accident benefits, unemployment," and hours of
labor. , .
We are keeping a complete record of all In
dustrial disturbances; collecting data relative
to strikes, lockouts, boycotts and injunction-;
In each strike or lockout, the number of men
Involved, amount of k lost time, loss to em
ployers and employes are considered. Where
there are conflicting statements the point of
view of both sides to the controversy is given
In an appended statement.
In the. store and factory inspection an at
tempt Is made to get at all "social and indus
trial betterments"; all endeavors on the part
of the employers to better the conditions of the
employed; and attempts on .the part of.the"lal
tÂ«r to Improve their opyorumitiee are being
looked Into.

State: The bureau is hand (capped, by the -lack
of any reliable data of. former years with
which to ; make comparisons. : â¢ .
\u25a0 The agricultural labor situation presents- a
serious problem to. the California; rancher. The
competition with the Oriental has put this clase
of labor on a very poor.- basis. The bureau is
obtaining data relative to me wages, food; na
tionality and boclal condition of farm ; labor
throughout the State. . "*" . . ...
In the chapter- on chf|d labor we, wllj treat
of the ages and condition or children employed;

and effect of child labor law.- â¢ - - Â« - : - â¢
The last Legislature passed a â¢ law directing
the Commissioner of Labor to collect statistics

same to the Legislature. We "are- getting
monthly statement* from the 1 different coilnty
officers on these subjects and shall have a mass
of interesting &nd instructive data along; this

The law requires the compilation "of statistics
relative to Orientals, and this is. being done in
an thorough manner as iÂ«, possible. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0: We are ob
taining the exact figures as to the number of
Chinese. Japanese and Koreans . arriving and

SIOUX CITY, "lowa. Sept. 5.-Havia*
been lost In the Great American Desert
for more than two .weeks.' relatives have
readied the conclusion that Harry Thom
as, a wealthy real estate dealer of Supe
rior. Wis.. Is dead. His brother, Alfred
Thomas, general agent for the Equitable
Life Assurance Society, left Sioux City
to-day to head a ' searching party that
will be organized at Searchlight. Nev.
The missing man has not been * heard
from " since August 13. when â¢he ' left
Searchlight alone to explore some mining
property in the Interior. He is presumed
to have met with -an accident, died of
hunger or been devoured by some beast.
Thomas took - only a small quantity of
provisions and was not prepared to with
stand long exposure.
* It is not believed Thomas was killed by
robber 3. as he had no large sum ot money
on : his person. He declined to have any
one acompany him, because his mission
was secret. He was 73 years old and had
a family.

FACE HIS TRIAL
Ytatli Accused of Complici
ty in Murder of Thomas
Cook Is Held to Answer
MOTHERS HOPE CRUSHED
Boy's Parent Breaks Down
When Judge Gonimits; Son
to Custody !X>Â£ Sheriff
OAKLAND, Sept. 5â A dramatic inci
dent was witnessed this morning at the
prelimnalrjrj examination of Percy Pem
broke, one of the three members of the
"Jim Crow" gang who are charged, with
the murder of Thomas W. Cook on
Juty 22.
, As the accused youth was brought Into
court handcuffed to Sheriff Frank Bar
net, Mrs. S. J. Pembroke, the mother of
the. prisoner, rushed forward and throw-
Ing her arms around the neck of her son
exclaimed, "Oh, Percy, my poor, poor
boy! 1 hope they will let you gol" \u25a0â¢\u25a0
The mother's hopes were vain, how
ever, for, like Blaker and Schneider, his
companions in the crime which resulted
in ihe death of Cook, Pembroke was held
to answer for murder. As Justice of the
Peace William R. -Geary pronounced the
fateful words which committed her son
to the custody: of the Sheriff, Mrs. Pem
broke started ' toward the prisoner, but]
she staggered and would have fallen had
it not been for the supporting arm of her
husband.
The testimony on which Pembroke was
held ta answer was the same as that pre
sented by the prosecution in the cases
of .Blaker and Schneider. - Attorney - Lin.
Church, representing the defense, asked
but few questions itt cross-examination."
MOKXING ORCHESTRA :
GIVES UP LABORS
Smart Musical Club Disbands
After a Brave Struggle
to. Succeed.-. ::_
OAKLAND.' Sept. 6.â For lack o r f finan-^
cial and moral sur port /the Wednesday
Horning Musical Clob will disband, and
the smart organization .that has for. four
years or more struggled to. gain a hold On
the affections of the musically elect of
this city will pass into Oblivion. '^ Â«\u25a0 -
Phcenlx-like, the dub arose from the
ashes of the old Friday Morning Club of
early history and now, like its prede-.
cessor, it is sinking into nothingness,
weighted down with the burden of its
own ambition. For as the club grew in
years it aimed at higher standards,
whereupon its weakness became apparent.
It Tequires money to maintain high
standards, and some way the secretary
treasurer could not persuade the mem
bers that dues are the sinews that eupply
strength to the working body. .
The .Wednesday Morning Club was com
posed of over a hundred members, many
of them prominent both socially and in
the musical world, but it-is, hard to serve
tVo masters, and one cannot be a devotee
of fashion and of art at the same time.
Mrs. James G. Allen and Mrs. Newton
Koser . were the prime movers years ago
In the organization of the club, and its
existence up to the present *. time * was
mainly due to their heroic efforts. In

OAKLAND, Sept. s.â The Grand Jury I
has directed the District -Attorney to
bring suit against Assessor Henry, P. Dal-,
ton to collect money that he is "holding
from the t county treasury- for his own;
benefit.. To-day two documents were filed
by that bodywifh thf County Clerk in- v
structing that -suits be. instituted against
Dalton to recover, sums aggregating 14216,
which he has collected from the city of
Oakland for making duplicate assessment
rolls. ' -.- : â¢ . |
The courts have already decided that '
Dalton is entitled to retain only so much]
of the money received from the city f or J
making the ' rolls as he actually expends'
in the work, but for a number of years
past he has kept all of it. In 1903 he col
lected $2800 from the city of. Oakland,'
while in 1904 he collected $2816. . !
The Grand Jury states that the work
could not have cost him more than $700
each year, .and, deducting $1400 from the
aggregate of the two years, directs that
he be sued for the balance, amounting to
$4216. '\u25a0'['

Military Commander at Uni
versity Wroth Over Acts
of Thoughtless Cadets
FIREARMS ARE RUINED
Hundreds of Rifles in Arm
ory, Property of Govern
ment, Rendered Worthless
BERKELEY, Sept. 6.â The soldierly eye
of Captain J. T. .' Nance, V military : com
mander' at the .University of 'California,
has detected a sadly demoralized state of
affairs in the university armory with re
gard to . the condition . of ' the hundreds "; of
guns used, by students in their evolutions
under. his direction. . '[ \- '.^ \u25a0
According to those who have heard the
results of Captain Nance's examination,
about9o.per cent of the 800 rifles in the
armory are practically worthless,; excepjt
for, exhibition purposes. The : guns are
supposed ". to ibe Â» kept"; in first-class : condi
tion,*: the : theory.; being that both cadet*
and ; : " arms ; should -be ,. always ready in
event of a call to' arms from the State
or nation." '
.Probably no such call is likely to be
issued, but, according to ; Captain Nance,
the; arms ' must ,â¢ be maintained,; just as
though demand for them might be made
any: moment. '" ". p '/" \u25a0\u25a0J'iiH,
Shock after, shock has come to Captain
Nance j at ' the sight of Irreverent sopho
mores or freshmen in the ranks using the
triggers' of .their rifles -to shoot -pebbles
at their classmates in- line, or In other
ways taking liberty with their - arms.
These exhibitions have been like* other
traditions of i student life, j all Cadets
fancying that college spirit required them
to keep up the tactics they saw practiced
by upper classmen. . . Hence demoralization
of the armory. . ;
A "quiet j tip" has come from the arm
ory during the last few days that j Cap
tain Nance' has his eye open : for' any . in^

govern soldiers in the use of their equip

ing, in \u25a0] schoolboy, fashion .with his rifle

this disease, which has been considered
as incurable as consumption, is now un-
der control. In commenting on' ' the
above, the Eureka "Dally Times" pre-
senta the recovery of J. H. Gyselaar,
well known In that city, and says it
leads to the irresistible conclusion that
a cure for this dread disease has been
found.
Brothers Henry and Milnes pre both
slow. Petalumans have known for three
years that Brighfs Disease is now
about as curable as la grippe. There
have probably been over a dozen recov-
eries in this city and vicinity. The son
of our well-known merchant, Thomaa
Haskins, was one of them, and Peter
Jorgensen, the Two Rock farmer, was
another. *
Mr. Jorgensen was blind and in con-
vulsions when put on the new specific,
and friends were about the house
awaiting hourly for his death. Both of
these recoveries were nothing shorfof
a miracle, and the curability of chronic
Brigbt's Disease is now a settled fact.
We marvel that the' news of the discov-
ery has not ere this spread all over the
globe.â Petaluma Daily Argus.

WOEFULLYIGNORANT
OF WHAT'S DOING.
Arthur G. Baird Knows Nothing of the
Current Making of History.
Likewise Is Unable to Explain Why He
Committed Battery on Bellboy. '
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Arthur O. Baird's physical presentment
served to corroborate his plea that he
must have been subjected to great provo
cation ere he battered the bellboy. His
countenance was rubicund and his figure
rotund and his mouth corners had the
upward curve that chronic good-nature
fashions and preserves. That he had
never maliciously injured any living
thing was the unanimous opinion of the
character-reading sharps in Police
Judge Mogan's court.
Yet the bellboy awore most positively
that he was strictly attending to his own
business and not noticing Mr. Baird at all
when that gentleman picked him up as
if he were a babe and toyed with him
until his body and limbs were sore and
all the buttons had departed from his
uniform. Several other attaches of the
Great Western Hotel, wherein the per
formance occurred, told the same story.
"It's most extraordinary," ! said Mr.
Baird to the Judge; "if these witnesses
tell the truth, and they seem to be most
veracious, I must have been drunker than
â thanâ than â "
"The proverbial boiled owl," his Honor
accommodatingly suggested.
"Yes, sir; a boiled owl will serve," was
the grateful rejoinder. "If I treated this
boy as he says I did my behavior was
disgraceful and you should punish me
most severely."
Then he musingly soliloquized, "What
on earth could . have prompted me to
do it r V-Â» â¢;,*-: .-0,
"You are not an amateur athlete, are
you?" the Judge Inquired.
"No, sir; my only physical exercise Is
walkins."
"And you are not deeply interested in
the coming prizefight at Colma?"
"What prizefight is it?". Svit^
Clerk Gray almost gulped the rubber
eraser clutched by his lips, and Bailiff
Mahoney dropped his keys. Commotion
at the attorneys' table and murmur of
astonishment in the auditorium.
After gazing fixedly a full moment at
Mr. Balrd's imperturbable face, the Judge
managed to whisper, "Guilty; sentence
to-morrow." '
"Wonder If he knows there's a circus in
town," remarked the still incredulous
clerk. y.^
John Thompson poked among the books
for sale at the Emporium until he found
one that was likely to suit his literary
taste, so he surreptitiously, pocketed It
and was departing when the special thief
taker arrested him. The title of the vol
ume was "Korea," and. Mr. Thompson
told Judge Fritz that he fancied it be
cause he contemplated a trip to the
Orient and desired to obtain some ad
vance information anent the countries he
proposed to visit. His vocation, he stat
ed, was that of ore sampling, but since
he became afflicted with tuberculosis he
found labor disagreeable.
As the man really seemed to be pretty
far gone in consumption's clutch, the
Judge continued the case.
Sylvester Grlffan stole a pair of shoes
which Henry Hanson of 614 Montgomery
street had just made to order for Attor
ney Dibble and was wearing the plunder
when his arrest was effected,' yet he
boldly denied the theft and declared he
had paid an unknown man $1 for the
footgear, which was to cost Mr. Dibble
a sum of $7, and considered cheap at the
price by experts.
"I'm not guilty of this larceny," Mr.
Grlffan stoutly Informed Judge Conlan,
"and, what's more, I never in all my
thirty-eight years -of life told a false
hood." '-"V,-.. :
"You are too pure to be at large in
this sinful community," quoth his
Honor, "and to-morrow I will designate
the exact period of your retirement."
Mrs. S. Jordan of 3031 Sixteenth
street, at whose lodging - house - Mrs."
Anna Welch dwelt as the wife of
George Reeves, convicted of having:
failed to provide ; for . his real wife,
sent her husband to inform Judge Mo
gan that she was ill and unable to
attend court to testify against '\u25a0 Mrs.
Welch, who is accused of adultery, but
the Judge told Mr. Jordan that unless
she Is very seriously sick his better half
must appear before him to-day. v' : , Mrs. :
Jordan's testimony is said to be essen
tial to the proving of Mrs. Welch's
guilt, as Reeves refused to testify.
Judge Fritz has given himself until
to-day to clarify his mind as to the
connection which two barrels of pickles
and a sum of seventy-five cents have
with the complaint that'Meyer Tlerken
taul disturbed the peace * of. Marcus
Gold's restaurant, 941 Folsom 'street;
and also battered several female mem
bers of the Gold family. The two bar
rels of pickles and the seventy-five
cents figured conspicuously in the tes
timony, but onlyra mind-reader could
ascertain ; exactly what they had to do
with the case.
Lay opinion' was divided as to
whether Mr. Tierkentaul sold the pick
les to Mr. Gold or purchased! them from
him,-, and, the relation of the seventy
five . cents to the ' pickles is 'as much a
mystery to . the legal: adepts as it ; was
before the case opened.

Bruno was, found a pearl-handled re
volver, fully loaded, so 'an additional
charge of carrying a concealed weapon
was registered against him. â¢
In the court of Judge Mogan the com
plaining policeman stated he had been
informed that: Bruno was armed with
special intent to- kill him because- of
his (Morton's) persistent endeavor to
break up a gang of thugs to which the
defendants belonged, t When questioned
by the Judge . In regard to the ; officer's
statement, Bruno signified inability to
understand English, but he managed to
pick up and answer some of his Hon
or's subsequent queries ere they were
translated to him-by an Interpreter.
Bruno was pronounced guilty and the
i other .cases .were continued till next
Friday.; :-; : "- ; : :
Alfred Angell, who killed A. Giannini
several weeks ago in a Pacific street
saloon, was held for murder* by Judge
Conlan, bail being unmentioried; The
woman- in the cast* was Qiannini's wife,
whose infatuation for Angeli led her
to the imprudence of posing with him
before a camera. Angeli boasted of his
conquest, and when Giannini remon
strated he was killed. Giannini was a
marble cutter and Angeli a butcher.
Dr. "W. A. Harvey told Judge Fritz
that the knife wound in James McGin
ley's left breast, which had been in
flicted by W. F. Hopkins, was rather
serious, and th,en the defense called Dr.
James H. O'Connor and Dr. Hugh La
gan, who opined that the wound "as it
had been described by Dr.' Harvey was
not rather serious. This difference of
surgical opinion : led the court to sug
gest that the wound be examined by
Drs. O'Connor, Lagan and Harvey, a
proposal to which the defendant con
sented. .
"Do you thlfck," the Judge asked one
of the doctors, "that a wound to be dan
gerous must necessarily be deep?"
"No," was the reply. "If a pin scratch
Is infected It is dangerous."
The; case will be given another. Inning
next Friday morning.
' For disturbing the peace of an O'Far
rell street music hall last Saturday even-
Ing John Slavin and John Barrows . were
arrested, but they were> in prison only a
short time when friends bailed them out.
Then the prudent Mr. Barrows shunned
the cheering cup that primarily led to his
incarceration, while the less discreet Mr.
Slavin resumed his carouse. .
When the case was called before Judge
Mogan there was Instant j response from
Mr. Barrows, but in. courtroom and cor
ridor the bailiff bawled In vain for. Mr.
Slavin. So the Judge decided to forfeit
Mr. Slavin's bail and proceed with the
case of Mr. Barrows. As the prosecution
failed to . prove that the alleged peace
fracture was very serious, dismissal was
ordered and Mr. Barrows went forth to
collect his bail money. :
Soon afterward there rang throughout
the tribunal a loud and prolonged snore,
and when the vigilant bailiff traced it to
its source he discovered that it had ema
nated from the . nasal organ: of an. un
questionably intoxicated \u25a0 occupant of a
back seat. When dragged to the bench
and asked who , .; he was, the prisoner
drowsily murmured:
"John Slavin, 'n' hot guilty."
It subsequently developed that Mr. Sla
vin was drunk when he first entered the
Hall of Justice and that while waiting
the calling of his case, he augmented his
drunkenness by visiting, a near-by grog- :
gery. .There he 7 was- discovered by his
anxious bondsmen, who , . escorted him
back to the courtroom and seated him
upon the back bench,. they. being unaware)
that his case had been , disposed of dur

TAFT IN CHINA.
T^HE visit of Secretary Taft to China is a diplomatic move ot
I first importance. Our Government having shown its intention
to promote amicable relations between the two countries, to the
end thai their mutual commerce might prosper, the response_of
China is materially aided and a better understanding is promoted by
the presence of an immediate representative of the President. Ihe
boycott of American goods will rapidly wane as a result. But, as it
passes, there is one; aspect in which it is worth considering. It. was
a proof that the Chinese are, after all, not so widely different from
other races as has been supposed. It was evidence that they are
moved by the same motives that impress all men, and have the
same aspiration for equality of treatment.
The spirit of our legislation as to Chinese labor has been that
of recognition of previously acquired rights, that arose under the
llurlingame treaty and the several .amendments thereto. In this
spirit Chinese had the right to return to their own country and come
back here, proper precautions being taken as to identification, to
prevent substitution. The Chinese show themselves much like
other people when they complain because we have added a property
qualification to complete their right to come back. Their right of
complaint arises in the fact that we do not enforce a property quali
fication upon other foreign laborers, who come and go as they please.
Added to the property qualification in the case of the Chinese is that
cf a family. If a Chinese laborer have a family here he can go to his
own country and come back. But as we deny to laborers the right
to bring wives with them, and therefore in most cases the right to
have a .family.- thisHcjause in the law is of little consequence.
The boycott has served to call attention, very sharply, to our
international policy. S.lt has reminded the whole country that Asia
is in the same relation in respect to commerce and immigration to
this coast that Europe is to the Atlantic coast. While the commerce
of the Atlantic seaboard' is having its! troubles, in the differential
tariff boycott started by Germany, we are having ours with Asia.
The coming of Japanese here has been one cause of apprehension,
but that will pass away. The Japanese are expanding westward
instead of eastward. They are migrating to Manchuria and Korea in
greater numbers than ever came here. They are following the re
sults of their expulsion of Russia from China and Korea, and their
opportunities there are much greater and will meet with less re
sistance than here.
In a little while we will have on hand only our relations with
China. The solution of that problem is, indicated by many outgiv
ings. The most significant of these is from Mr. Sargent, the Com
missioner of Immigration, who after his visit to Hawaii gave it. as
his opinion that our immigration laws should operate equally upon all
classes and upon all races. It would seem that in a republic, dedi
cated by its constitution* to equality, this is a proper and dignified
policy. It interests the merchants, producers-and manufacturers of
this coast quite as much as reciprocity interests the same classes of
the Middle West and the East. We cannot be badly affected by
exclusion of classes of Chinese, provided the law of the land gives
equal treatment to all nations. It is complained by China, and not
without reason, that while she is treated equally by England, Ger
many, Holland and France, our commercial rivals, we refuse the
same equality.
Instead of abating at all our Chinese exclusion, let its principles
.be extended to all nations, to the end that there may be a lowering
of the vast flood of undesirable immigration from Europe. It will
i hen appear that California, initiating exclusion, was the forerunner
of a national policy applying equally to all nations.
The impression made by Secretary Taft in China will be,con
nected in the mind of that people with the beginning of the eleva
tion of China to equality among the nations. When the Secretary
stopped in Japan, en route to the Philippines, and received exceeding
public recognition, great complaint was made in St. Petersburg. But
Ills call in Japan was the necessary preparation for this most useful
and successful visit to China. It enabled him to carry with him
not only the prestige of his own Government and his position therein,
but also the recognition of Japan and all that it implies, for China
is just now quickly responsive to Japanese influence.
But do our people generally recognize the newness of such
events as the visit of Secretary Taft to Asia? Heretofore it has
been of little use to appeal to our -Government for a show of its
hand in such matters as commercial restriction and disadvantage.
The feeling has been that merchants should look out for themselves,
and let trade ebb and flow haphazard. If our interests suffered in
one place they were expected to bear the loss or make it up some
where else. Xow an immediate representative of the Government,
one of its chiefs, appears in the midst of a people exceedingly sensi
tive to that sort of thing, and speaks for the United States in regard
to a retaliatory restriction upon our commerce. Immediately the
bar to trade recedes and in a. few weeks, if we give no further senti
mental provocation, our commerce will be flowing as unobstructed
BUNKERS' CONFESSION.
A MAX once was converted in a protracted meeting and stood
up to make public confession of his past sins. Instead of this
he proceeded to confess the sins of his neighbors. The preacher
stopped him, saying. "Confess your own sins." The cautious con
vert replied: "1 would, but it is notsafe while the Grand Jury is in
session." '\. ' "' .' . *
Senator Bunkers in jail, and under sentence of five years for
bribery, having nothing more to fear from the Grand Jury, is said to
have relieved his mind by confessing the sins of his associates in the
Senate, not only in the session of 1905, but in that of 1903. This late
openheartedness of the convicted Senator will cause general regret
that.his legislative 'career did not extend away back to the piping
limes of 1890 and '92, when Colonel Mazuma was in business almost
as openly as the bootblacks and fruit peddlers in the lobbies of the
Capitol at Sacramento. Had he been he. would have now a tale to
unfold that would make the hair stand on many a bald head 'Not
having such a prolonged experience, it must be admitted that his has
been lively if short. '
Growing lonesome in jail, and not receiving comfort from his
associates indicted or yet waiting for that formality, he is believed
to have relieved the tedium of existence by a confession, requiring
35,000 'words to inscribe all that he knows about the relation of
finance to statesmanship. This -confession, coming ''at the same time
as the discovery of the man who acted as agent for the bribe-taking
Senators in the exchanging of paper money for gold, 'keenly renews
interest in the sensation of the last session of the Legislature. The
interest in an old subject is ndt merely renewed. There is said to be
new matter in this confession, involving men close #p to the munici
pal administration of this city. Senator Bunkers 'belonged to the
same political party as the Mayor, and if he tell the secrets of the
charnel house the city campaign will have a sharp edge at the sfart

And while he's somewhere near me I've
.an eye upon my pelf, . " r
For he may not know, all mortals, but
. you bet he knows himself.
For a man may hide his methods

A CHAT WITH EBEKEZER,
WE have wireless telegraphy, Ebe
nezer, smokeless: powder, /horseless
carriages. We discuss these things
with some enthusiasm; and more or less
pride In our inventive race. But there. is
another thing, apparently of the same
class, which elicits less" enthusiasm and
pride from us. Wha.t is ' it, do you ask?
Why, I should think that you could guess
â it is a thinkless thought,; of course. I
suppose there can be no doubt that you
know what a thinkless thought is, but for
fear that you may not I will define it be
fore we proceed any further. A thinkless
thought is one of the thoughts we think
we omy think we are thinking. I
Is the definition clear to you, Ebenezer?
Let us illustrate it. Luther Burbank en
gaged in agriculture and horticulture,
and thought about his business. Millions
of other men, since "in the image of God
created He hini," have engaged in similar
industries and never thought about them
at allâ but they thought they did. A vast
multitude of men go through life think
ing nothing but thinkless thoughts, and
another' vast multitude very rarely think
anything else.
You imagine, Ebenezer, that you are
.thinking vast, burning thoughts concern
ing your desired marriage with the / little
girl who is about as fit to marry to-day
as she was sixteen years ago. You are
not, my boy; your thoughts are of the
thinkless kind, and so emphatically are
they of this kind : that I flatter you by
calling them thoughts at . all. Old Grab
grind supposes that he is thinking when
he obeys- the first instinct of his nature
by figuring on how he can seize and hold
a few more dollars that he cannot use.
He, too, is mistaken, and few "thoughts"
are more thinkless than his: This is clear,
demonstrable truth, but it is very hard to
make the average thinkless thinker be
lieve it. . : v .' \u25a0
Illustrations might be continued, but
let's sum it/ up, as follows: And now
abideth wireless telegraphy, horseless
carriages and thinkless thought, but' the
greatest and most sickening of these^ls
thinkless thought. Z Z -

EQUINOCTIAL STORMSâ A- C. A..
Santa Rosa, Cal. There l's certainly a
tendency In nearly all parts of the
globe to "broken" weather during the
latter half of the months of March and
September. This Is due to the fact
that at these seasons cold currents of
air from the poles and warm currents
from the equator meeting In the tem
perate zones cause cyclonic disturb
ance of the atmosphere, high winds
and consequent rains. Nevertheless,
there Is no data to show that the oc
currence of severe storms at these
times 13 a certaintrs The "equinoctial
gale" Is as strongly ; believed In in
Great Britain as In the United States.
In April and in October, the prevailing
winds in ; the Indian Ocean, known as*;
monsoons,' 'shift their directions, and
this time Is known as the "bursting of
the monsoons," and is marked by hur
ricanes and violent winds. , Statistics
of storms In' Europe or America do not
show the equinoctial gale with any
positiveness, and the conclusion must
be that the widespread belief Is prob
ably founded upon the general report
of sailors concerning storms on tht
ocean at this date. Such storms at that
date are not an. Invariable occurrence.
There Is no reason why a traveler go
ing from. San Francisco to New Yorlc
via Panama should not expect reason
ably fair weather during September.

Pishop O. W. Whittaker of Pennsyl
vania addressed a large and enthusias
tic meeting of the Woman's Auxiliary
yesterday afternoon in the " Trinity

The Bishop told of the methods of
collecting money for foreign missions
by the auxiliary league and stated that
while he was pastor of the church in
Virginia City that parish gave the lar
gest collection for foreign missions of
any parish in the United States. He
was afterward made ' Bishop of Penn

creasing the number of auxiliaries and
swelling the funds of the foreign mis
sions.
At the conclusion of the address a
collection was taken up to be sent to

POSTUM CEREAIu
OUST THE DEMO.V.
A Toaale With Coffee.
There is something: fairly demoniacal
in the- way coffee sometimes wreaks its
fiendish malice on those who- use it.
A lady writing from California says:
My husband and I. both lovers of
Â«offet. suffered for some time from a
very annoying: form of nervousness, ac-
companied by most frightful headaches.
In my own oase there was eventually
developed some sort of affection of the
nerves leading from the spine to the
head.
"I was unable to hold my head up
straight, the tension of the nerves drew
it to one side, caueing me the most In-
tense pain. We got no relief from medi-
cine, and were puzzled as to what caus-
ed the trouble, tfll a friend suggested
that possibly the coffee we drank had
something to do with It, and advised
that we quit It and try Postum Coffee
"We followed his advice, and from
the day that we began to use Postum
we both began to improve, and in a
very short time both of us were en-
tirely relieved. The nerves became
steady once more, the headache ceased
the muscles in the back of my neck
relaxed, my head straightened up and
the dreadful pain that had so punished
me while I used the old kind of coffee
vanished. .
"We have never resumed the use of
the old coffee, but relish' our Postum
every day as well as we did the former
beverage. And we are delighted to find
that we can give It freely to our 'chil-
dren also, something we never dared to
do with tho old kind of coffee." Xame

Postum. Coffee contains absolutely no
drurs of any kind, but relieves the cof-
fee drinker from the old drug = poison
There's a reason.

SAYS HUSBAND
DRUGGED COFFEE
Beverage Meant for. Wife
Alleged to Have Almost
Killed Unfortunate Dog
Judge Graham decided yesterday that
Mattie 1^ Pock was entitled to a di
vorce from Benjamin F. Peck and so
ordered, the decree being issued on the
ground of extreme cruelty. Peck is
employed by the United Railroad?. "
Mrs. pf-ck testified that one morning
her husband, apparently being in an
unusually gentle frame of mind, insist
ed in pouring cream In her coffee. She
says she was delighted with his con
duct until she detected a strange, bit
ter taste in the coffee. She said noth
ing, she testified, but put the coffee
aside until her husband had left the
house. Then she informed some mem
bers of the household of her suspicions
and they poured the coffee down a
dog's throat.
In a short time, said Mrs. Peok. -the
dog was taken ill and Its life was saved
by heroic measures, including rolling
on a barrel* ;i means used to recusci
tate people apparently drowned, and
dosing with emetics.
"The next day I accused my husband
of having'made an attempt on my life,"
said Mrs. Peck, "and he asked me what
I was going to do about it; if I in
tended having him arrested. I told
him I did not, but that I would leave
him. and I did."
Sirs. Peck gave a few other. instances
of her husband's cruelty, with the re
sult that the court granted her a di
cree as prayed.
Decrees of divorce were granted yes
terday to Ernest O. from Ella Kibbe
for desertion, Margaret from William.
G. Fitzgerald for desertion, Bertha C.
from Thomas J. Ward for failure to
provide, Kate from Al J. Palmer for
willful neglect, Judia C from Henry
Schroder for cruelty, and Florence R.
from Oliver D. Towles for failure to
pfovJde. Suits for divorce were filed by
Marie agai&st Jost Iseli for cruelty,
James A. against Minnie Warner for
cruelty and desertion, E. against Ethel
B. Hlnrich.s for desertion, and Millie A.
against Ed Roberts for desertion.
Thomas Dunne filed suit yesterday to
annul his marriage to Kate Dunne. The
plaintiff ajleges that when he married
Mrs. Dunne she had another husband
living, of which fact he had no knowl
edge. '

The transport Buford sailed for the
Philippines at noon yesterday. Shy went
loaded to her utmost capacity. Her cab
ins were crowded to the limit with pas
sengers and her hold was filled with
freight. She took Troops A, B, C. E, F
and G of the Fourth Cavalry and head
quarters and band.
Mrs. Fltzhugh Lee and Miss Virginia
Lee were passengers going out to Manila
to visit Lieutenant George M. Lee, now

Fourth Cavalry band played some dozen
lively airs, winding up with "Good-by,
Little Girl, Good-by.": followed by "The
Star-Spangled . Banner" as the boat
backed out into the stream.
There were about 1000 people on the
dock, who set up a great cheering as they
heard the â¢ strains . of the national i an

BRIGHT WOMEN
AT WORK AGAIN
California Club Holds Its
First Meeting of Winter
at the Old Headquarters
NEW HOME DISCUSSED
Country Air Stimulates the
Vocabulary and Much of
It Is Brought Into Play
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
For three months have the clubwomen
hereabouts been without the joys and
cares of clubdomâ all â¢ save- the building
committees of the' two ambitious club 3
that are erecting homes, the California
and the Century. Arid these women have
been working overtime. . '
Yesterday the California Club' held its
"how-de-do" meeting at the old stand In
the Y. M. C. A. building, and about 400
members, nut-brown and cheery, made
John, the elevator man, busier than he
had been these three months.
No programme had tjeen praparjd, but
there wasn't a dull moment In the meet
ingânot when the watchdogs of the 1
treasury got busy.
A pity the Equitable didn't have a few
of these sagacious women on its board of
directors ! Hazen Hyde j would have had
a swell chance to win fame as a host.
The club had under discussion the, open-
Ing of its beautiful new home on Clay
streetâ when, and how. The fresh, coun
try"' air seemed to have vitalized
the vocabulary of the voluble, for
much* talk was unloosed before it was
decided to open the- club home â¢ with a
large evening reception, to be given, some
time during the llrst week or two of
October.
This agreed upon, every woman im
mediately set to work to plan her gown
for the swaggerlst affair of clubdom
even to the watchdogs of the club treas
ury. That Is the woman of It!
It is believed . that the carpenters and
painters and plumbers and decorators and
electricians and inspectors and walking
delegates will be out of the building in a
week. Then the horde of furnishers will
swarm in, and by-the first everything will
be shipshape to begin housekeeping.
The next meeting of the club will be
in its own home-bright "a. its own fire
side. And the roseate dream will thus
be realized.
The Sketch Club will : li'oid its next ses
sion in its charmingly appointed rooms,
as will the Cllonian Clubâ the first two
tenants of the first woman's club building
in San Francisco.
Many pretty/ compliments were passed
up to the president, Airs. Aylett R. Col
ton, who has proved herself a little trump
in guiding the affairs of the clubhouse
and who has "stood as a peace plenipo
tentiary" between the building committee,
thi board of directors, the club and the
plucky young chap of an architect, Wil
liam Knowlesâ he who has won fame as
a diDlomat. /'jtr-r/ 'jtr-r
AUDIENCE LISTENS Â»^'
TO INDIAN MUSIC
Lyric Hall- Concert Troves
Highly Pleasing- to Large
Assemblage.
An audience of fashion and culture
greeted the programme offered last even
ing by Harvey Worthington Loomis and
Edwin Star Belknap.
Mr. Loomis' presentation of music was
varied, dealing with Indian intonation of
five tribes, showing great individual col
oring, with the preservation of the red
man's strange guttural throughout, and
Mr. Loomis was f<jrtuhate in having sing
ers who most happily caught the peculiar
accents and rhythm. They were Miss
Louvia Rogers, Mrs.M. E. B. Robinson,
Mrs. Klippel Schaffter, . Lowell Redneld
and Ernest H. McCandllsh. ,
Hother Wlsmef played a lyric finale for
violin, a composition combining dainti
ness with attractive melody, and many
dramatic . points.
The pantomime of "The Enchanted
Fountain," devised by Mr. Belknap, di
vulged a beautiful and fantastic concep
tion, introducing many subtle and artistic
pictures in the telling of a story potent
without words.
The programme was of a character al
most entirely new. to San Franciscans,
and to Judge by the enthusiasm â¢? of ap
plause met -almost immediately with high
favor. '\u25a0-,*'
Those taking part in the pantomime In
cluded Miss A. G. Clark, - Miss Merriam,
Miss Louise Perrin. Miss Clara Galloway,
Lee Millar and Herbert Williams.
With rich costuming .and graceful
movements the effect was one of ka
leidoscopic grace.
Little 'Mf S3 Vlctorine Devret materially
assisted Mr. Loomis in his exposition ot
piano duets for children.
The attendance of musicians was large
and from them, came a hearty recognition
of the merits of the authors and J the ex
tremely pleasing nature of every number.
Of the Indian songs ! perhaps the most
appealing was "The- Sun Worshipers,"
and that on account of quick | comprehen-'
slon, its arrangements ":.;. suggesting im
mediately the adoration and supplication
embodied in Indian worship.

BOWIW SAYS
JAPAN WINS
Stu dent of Nipponese Thinks
Russia Has Been Caught in
Web of Adroit Diplomacy
INDEMNITY THE TRUMP
31 ikado Never Meant to Force
the} Claim, but by -.--Urging
It He Got Liberal .Ter^ns
Henry P. Bowie, the well-known writer,
artist and Japanese- scholar of San
Mateo, was at the Palace Hotel yester
day.' Having spent .many, years in Jnp^n.
the language and literature of which he
knows as well as his English, : he /is
naturally much Interested in the treaty, of
Portsmouth, concerning which he \u25a0 holds
decided views. .
Having "practised law, in San Francisco
fo: many, years, "Mr. Bowie is, conversant
with international jurisprudence, arid he
believes Japan has wona wonderful vic
tory in 'diplomacy. Concerning this, vic
tory he g-ave out the following authorized
interview: \u25a0 â¢
By the world at large Russia is considered
to have . scored ' a success ;\u25a0 in the peace . nego
tiations, and Japan is -thought to have t been
outwitted.' . Buf Mstory will credit; Japan with
having won the greatest diplomatic . victory
ever achieved.* â¢ -"- : : â¢ * \u0084
Neither nation sued for peace, but both want
ed ;lt. Our President invited, a conference
between them. . At this. couterencÂ« the Jap
anese ' were : requested to sthte the terms', on
which' thÂ«y -\u25a0 would consent to ' a -'settlement. :
This : was alieady. a.ixilnt gained; for Japan.
Shu was treated as the conquering nation, con
sidered the party, to be placated. .' I'ossibly,
however,- Witte purposely by ; 'this move en
couraged Japan to ; tak-? that \u25a0; very, .view,' in
order 'to lead her into a snare. Japan formu
lated her terms of peaceâ to two soi these,: re- :
spect^ng indemnity and " SaKhalien, Kussla
positively ob>*fted. To two others "she iron
scnted that argument pro- and ; con ; might be
made. Thereupon, and .with wonderful ajaerhy,.
the Russian envoys consented to all' the oth.?r
articles of Japan's peace conditions. â¢* .
.''-W htn 'indemnity was reached a 'deadlock oc
curred/. Russia refusing to ' pay a" cent. By
Wltte generously consenting to discuss seria
tim'all the other terms and by yielding these
willingly and ' promptly 'lt : seemed - that
he' had-: i ingeniously 'led* the Japanese
plenipotentiaries into '\u25a0'. a trap. ; For \u25a0 ha
permitted- them to claim .'all they ; had de
niandcu bsfore the war; and much in addition
thereto, which they advanced on 'the strength
of their successes ln>. the war, and ,, he yielded
to them virtually everything of Importance ex
cepting indsmnlty. \u25a0 .
RUSSIA MAKES MOVK.
Sg'that if the Japanese now insisted on con
tinuing the struggle , they [ would j be I virtually
fighting for blood money, and would ooeupy
an ' odlou6 '.;â¢ position -before '\u25a0 the entire
civilized s world. Thfr \u25a0 Kussi&ns value
money, and they ingeniously continued in tli.s
manner to save the thousand millions >>t it<ii
lars against which all- else they had . conceded
had bt- come innlgnlflcant, for they "were- in
these \u25a0 particulars . almost making a â¢ virtue of
necessity. - . ' , .
But as to indemnity* Russia was obstinate.
Not a kopec would she pay for tribute. At
this Juncture the President intervened and
doubtless {greatly helped the Russian <au.se. in
Witte'e opinion, by trying to persuade tilm to
pay *at least $t300.0(X).(!lK), for this . made his
refusal to pay. appc-ar to the world all th^
greater and more Important an act. .
Suddenly at this juncture the Japanese
waived the. whole question of Indemnity and a
final acretment was reached. \
The/ Japanese ' were r = pralsed for their com
placency, moderation -and : humanity, while "th?
Kuesian plepipotentlarles were declared to have
won In diplomacy. But did thr Russians
win?. L<et us oon?ider: The American pubic
will remember that from. the bt ginning of tliis
war; Japan declared that ju;ion Its termination
she would insist upon^ndemnlty. . and she not
only made, her own people . believe In .this
claim, but she convinced" Russia 'nnd thp world
that Â«<he would certainly demand It as the one
paramount condition of any. possible ' settle
ment of hostilities. '.Honco it. forme* one of
thtlr articles in the peace termsâ and It was
Insisted upon until the conference J threatened
to break' up. The President even' was im
pressed with its "equity ; and tried to obtain
some indemnity, for them, and , when finally
Tokio yielded Komura is reported to have
torn his hair arid Takhlra' stamped/ with vexa
tion. If they so did, - were they in earnest?
I think not. On, the contrary, their labjrs had :
securtil for Japan \u25a0 evtrything they could in
reason demand â and they-knew it. - ;
\u25a0 Had St. Petersburg been blockaded from the
Baltic, Moscow invested and Llnevitchwith h'ia
army captured and imprisoned,' Japan could ;
successfully have ' demanded indemnity,' but
certainly under no other -conditions â and none :
of these conditions had been realized.
Russia was not suing | for peace, but on
the ' contrary had- nearly -. 800, CCO men In the
field ready to continue the struggle. She was i
far from | vanquished. i
. How could Japan have forced Russia to pay
one dollar- if she refused? She could not.:
And- are we to believe that Jaiian dld v not
know this as well as the world'at large knows
it? She knew it only too well, but her diplo
macy was to make . Russia, her, own people
and the world beside; believe that she not only
was entitled to Indemnity, but would nght
until she got it. /
INDEMNITY IMPORTANT.
This gave to indemnity the importance she
wished Russia to invest \ it withâ and, Rus.-ia
was caught in the : meshes of the most dex
terous \u25a0 Japanese diplomacy. \ . \u25a0-, ;";*'f^
â¢ The moment the Russians were persuaded
that .the Japanese, attached sucli supreme im
portance ,to ..Indemnity, that moment Witte
was ready Ito yield everything' to them to in
duce ' them to â¢ abandon < their claim* to it,", and
his astuteness placed them, from his point lof
view, , in a . reprehenEible : attitude before- the
civilized world if they refused his terma. -i.
; Hence this was the psychological moment the
plenipotentiaries -of Japan had anxiously
awaited. The protocols . having been signed by
both sides, placing beyond dispute tho fact that
Korea. ..Port . Arthur."; Dainy, Manchuria, the
railroads, the prisoners I.'1 .' accounts', and many
other : things 'had -been Irrevocably \u25a0 ceded- or
satisfactorily adjusted, â¢ one > night the looked
for instructions came \u25a0 from . the Emperor of
Japan to \u25a0 yield "indemnity and sign the treaty
oi Peace. ; ' ;
Indemnity was the trump card land Japan
won with it. A: learned Japanese scholar- of
Kioto once .said to Ine, -'.'ln , the ; character of
my, people! there are depths below depths,
chasms below chasms. Uhen the bottomless p't
They are unfathomable." . ' :. .
\u25a0 On '\u0084 the other | hand ; Japan's army and 'â¢ navy
had gained all and more than they were fight
inp for: It was an auspicious time for peace,
and tho only thing lacking was the irrevocable
rUln* of/ the ' status quo by^ a treaty with \u25a0 her
great but ! beaten foe. {V Japan â¢ had nothing to
gain by continuing the war. -Even. if she had
routed or destroyed aor captured the Russian !
army she would still have been in , no position

NELSON REFUSES TO ACCEPT JEFFRIES AS
OFFICIAL FOR BOUT WITH BRITT.
PRINCIPALS IN SATURDAY'S GREAT LIGHTWEIGHT FIGHT AND THE ARENA AT COLMA, WHERE THE AFFAIR WILL
BE STAGED. THERE ARE SEATING ACCOMMODATIONS FOR SOME 15,000 SPECTATORS AND IT IS EXPECTED NEAR
LY THIS MANY PEOPLE WILL, WITNESS THE BATTLE.' ' : . ' ' ... ...,>.
All Parties Interested Detlare the Match, \V ill \u25a0 Take
Place on 'Saturday Next at Golma. ,
"Jeffries will not referee the fight,"
were the final words of Manager Nolan
at a conference which lasted until 1 a. m.
this morning in Manager Jim Coff roth's
office. The meeting began at 9 o'clock.
Nolan was early on the scene and an
nounced to the newspaper men that,* as
Nelson's representative, he would not al
low Jeffries to act as referee. Nolan
said he wanted to discuss the matter
with, Willie Britt. Britt was telephoned
for out to Mike Sheehan's, where Jimmy
is in training.* He secured an automobile j
and after a break down' on the road ar
rived at Coffroth's office at 12:30 o'clock.
â¢Nolan opened the discussion by stating
that under no considt ration wouid he al
low Jeffries to act as refeÂ»-ee. He. stated,
as his reason that j Â»Â» lllie j_>ritt had sent
a telegram to Jefferies, asking the latter
to reduce his fee from *2000 to JlOOO. - :^ :
- Nolan said: '.'lf I cannot prove that
Willie Britt sent that telegram I am win
ing to let, Jefferies referee the tight.;!
can prove it. I do not know that Britt
signed his name to the telegram, but. I
do know that he signed tiie name of De
laney to it." " ;
Britt Jumped to his feet and shouted,
"That has nothing -to do with the case.
We won Jeffries on a toss. I had' a' right
to send forty telegrams to Jeffries \u25a0if 1
wanted to. j We are ready . for , the I battle
and we will be on the "grounds at 1:30 p.
m. on Saturday ready for the fight.,: Britt
is in. fine condition and ready, to go Into
the ring \u25a0at a moment's notice. 1 admit
that many people I know thought that
the sum of . $2000 was too high and that
$1000 was enough." '
Here Nolan jumped up and said; "Some
thing was doing when Jeffries dropped his
price."'"-. : \u0084\u25a0'"- \u25a0.-.; \u25a0'-'. . \u25a0", \u25a0\u25a0': \u25a0\u25a0' \. '\u25a0:.â¢'\u25a0.;- ...;v -'\u25a0â¢' ; *.
Here Billy Britt shouted in strenuous
tones. "If you can find any/ telegram
signed by name and- sent; to ~ Jeffries;
asking him to lower his fee Trom $2000
to $1000, you can'have'any;*refereeion
earth." Britt maintained, that the- rea^
soning. of Nolans was not; logical, iand
also cast a hint 'at' a" suggestion that
' Nolan's extraordinary actions might al
| most lead, him tpi believe) that .Nelson
I wanted to run out. Britt said he (had
heard \u25a0 Nelson was ; in . fine ; condition | and_
could; hardly believe that, he did want'
to "run out." . .. .'.;.,
".; ; Nolan again asserted that- Jeffries
should not referee' 'the* .fight. -This
brought^the stormy: meeting, to a close."
â¢ The ; general impression iof .those .present
at ;the .' meeting i was f that i Nolan - had I be
come overexcited at the coming, fight and
was â¢ rattled;?! Nolan* said' afterithe s meet- ;
ing had ended: ''I want ,the fight i to; come
off i and ; ; it \ wllL is I 'suppose \we \ will iselect
a new referee < to-morrow." .'On ; no â¢ condl^
tion. can Jeffries . act.; Nelson is in fine
condition ; and ready "for ;, the ring."
DISCONTENT â¢ AT; COLMA.
Nolan i and . Nelson *Do Not Seem to*
\u25a0 1 Know; ; What ;iTbey^ Want. \u25a0 .
; If : there is . one , spot * on .: the I peninsula'
f where fpeaceTandt contentment .have no
abiding % place % that * spoto t *f* ; Is ti% Nelson's
training camp : : at Â£ Colma. i4.There are

'\u25a0fii The 1- distrust ? has g even '^extended % â¢ to
the culinary; department,*? the; manager's
wife *now ' overseeing ' the .' preparation
of Nelson's food, for fe^ir It might be
doped. \u25a0 \u25a0 : \u25a0 .
â¢Nolan is worrying over what' he is
pleased to call the "switch in the bet
ting." There has been no suchthing,*
Britt being a. consistent favorite from
the start. There %vas no Nelson money
in sight and no betting' until ,the; price
dropped to 10 to 7 and but little has
been wagered at -those figures. >...\u25a0 '
The open air boxing show, has been
responsible as; much as anything else
for the. price. When every passerby
can, in the parlance of the ring, ,, "see
Nelson get -his head punched off" every
day by amateurs it "Is not, llkely::hls
"work will. impress the men who wager
large sums of money. : . \u0084 v
Nelson, who was never \u25a0 fast in .the
ring, has done work which tends :to
slow him. still more....- In bouts t with
each of his boxing mates he "goes\at.
his work a.s though it were an: actual
contest. The rounds are not shortened
and " itS is j a flght,. from -r first -{to- .last.
This severe work seems to' be gradually
breaking the spirit of the Battler and
he' is losing his old; buoyancy. -;:There
are also â¢ stories of sleepless . nights," a
condition which is not. conducive to
good form in an athlete! ' ; . \ . \u25a0
If Nelson reaches his old-time form
under his present ideas ; of training it
will be'a surprise.' 'He is: getting. all :
heavy, slow work,* while it is quick;
snappy action he requires. "
opinion is v expressed . : among
sporting . men to-night- that" Nolan and
Nelson; are either anxious | to^ get \ outof
the match or else are: trying?. to* force
a favorable financial settlement; In ad

he did. not show to; much advantage, al
though landing many blows on Hanlon'9
face and head. They were all lacking in
force, however, and did not for a moment
stop Tjanlon In 1 his continual forcing ot

In the fourth Hanlon forced Fitzgerald
to back up all through the round, taking
light lefts on tha face, but doing effec
tive work whenever ho got under tha
Eastern lad's long reach. In tha fifth
Hanlon beat. Fitzgerald about the body
severely, forcing bjm â¢to thÂ« ropes and
once almost sending him outside tha en
closure with his terrific blows to the
stomach. Tha 'sixth was also Honlon's
round. He had Fitzgerald tired and Just
before the close drove him to the ropes,
pounding the body and planting onÂ« good
left swing on the Jaw. Fitzgerald clinched
repeatedly and In endeavoring to counter
on Hanlon' s body appeared to strika
rather low. In the seventh and last round
Fitzgerald changed his tactics and when
they came to close work endeavored to
stand up and exchanged body punches
with Hanlon. He unintentionally struck
Hanlon low. Hanlon complained to the;
referee, who warned Fitzgerald not to re
peat the offense. Hanlon excused Fitzger
ald and shook hands with him to show
there were no hard reelings. They camei
together immediately, Hanlon forcing Fitz
gerald to the rope and hammering away;
at his ribs. Again Fitzgerald struck low

River Steamer Apache Backs
Into Coaster Gipsy Off
Greenwich Street Wharf
ALAMEDA BEACHES PORT
Oceanic SteanishipCompany's
Liner Brings Many Pas
sengers From Honolulu
The Southern Pacific's river steamer
Apache yesterday backed into the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company's little
coaster Gipsy off Greenwich-street ,
wharf. Both vessels were considerably
damag-ed owing to the Apache's failure
to Etop after the boats had come to
pether. The Gipsy, well out from the
pier-head line, was going from Broad
way wharf to the seawall. The South
ern Pacific steamer Is said to have ig
nored the Gipsy's whistles, and by the
time the Gipsy's captain realized his
danger it was too late to do anything
with the Gipsy.
After backing- her revolving stern
v.heel against the Gipsy's port side,
striking about amidships, the Apache
continued to work her engines until
wheel anfl shafts became so tangled up
with the Gipsy's woodwork that they
jammed and stopped.
The Apaqhe's fantail and wheel were
destroyed and both shafts were bent.
The Gipsy's port rail for about fifty
feet was carried away; deck beams
and stanchions were broken; the after
rigging, chain plates, bulwarks, rails
and davits were all more or less dam
aged; the deckhouse was jarred from
its foundations and the yawl was stove
in. Only the Gipsy's lack of size pre
vented the damage being more exten
sive.
The- Spreckels tug Defiance towed
the disabled Apache to her clip at the
ferry, and later she was towed to Oak- :
land tor. reoairE.
The Gipsy is one of the most famous
of the coasting fleet. She has run be
tween here and Santa Cruz for years,
and has long been known as "perpet
ual motion." She will take a long rest
now.

MISS KATCLIEFE WINS
Berkeley Experts Beats Miss
Dobbins and Miss Ryan
in Very Clever Fashion
The third day's play In the coast cham
pionship tennis events. In progress on the
Hotel Rafael courts, was confined yester
day to. women's singles and doubles. As
usual,, the Sutton sisters were the center
of -attraction iand, ; needless to say,' they
won their matches about as they, pleased.
Miss Violet Sutton .. .was the star and
played even better than she did last year.
Three players were left in the singles,
two from the south and one from : this
part .of : the State. MiSs Violet .. Sutton
reached the finals, where she will play
either Miss Florence Sutton or Miss Ethel
Ratcliffe of Btrkeley.
Miss Ratcliffe showed she is a player
of considerable class by the easy manner
in. which she' disposed of Mias Dobbins
and Mis, Ryan of the south.- Miss Dob
bins has b?en considered the strongest
player next to the Buttons, but Miss Hat
cliffe proved her superior. She also beat
Miss .Dobbins last. year. Miss Ratcliffe
beat Miss Ryan with ,'everi more ease.
After winning the first set 6-0 and having
a lead of 5*2 in the second, she let up a
bit, arid Miss Ryan almost made a deuce
set of -it. â¢ \u25a0' \u25a0 \u25a0 -' \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 . -.-".' ' r:'-''' 1
The best match of the day was that be
tween Miss' Violet Sutton and her sister,
Mrs. Bruce. Miss Violet's game was bet
ter than any she has ever played at San
Rafael, and her Bister at no time had a
Chance to win. The match, although one
sided, was an interesting one. Mrs. Bruce
won only one game in two . sets, but
many of the games were close.
Miss Violet Sutton also beat Miss Jone3
and Miss Peralta easily. The latter
played an interesting three-set match
with Miss Coffin. Miss Peralta lost the
first set, but pulled out the next two.
Miss Florence Sutton played only one
match, which she" ; won without difficulty.
Mrs. Seymour, her opponent, did her, best,
but she was no match . for Miss Sutton.
Many look to see Miss RatcUffe .makea
good showing against Miss Florence Sut
ton when they meet. ln the semi-finals.
Only two matches were played In the.
doubles : and both were won by teams
from this -sart of the State. The sur
prise was the defeat of Mrs. and Miss
Seymour by Miss Ida - Mearns and Miss
Vera Crocker of San Francisco. The
young ladles, who learned the game at
Golden Gate Park, were hardly expected
to make a showing. They not only did
this, but won the match in straight sets.
The winners played clever tennis, cutting
down a big lead in each set.
In the. other match Miss Miriam Hall,
formerly coast champion, and Miss Cof
fin beat Miss Bessie Valleau and Miss
Eleanor Jones easily. Miss Hall played
as well as ever and was a tower of
strength on her aide of the net. Miss
HalL and Miss Coffin .will meet Miss
Mearns and -Miss Crocker in the semi
finals. The other semi-final match will
be-between .Miss Violet- Sutton and Mrs.
Bruce and Miss" Ryan and -MUSs Peralta.
It is almost a certainty that Miss Sutton
and Mrs. Bruce- and Miss .Hall and Miss
'Coffin' will meet In the finals. ".' ~
The men's doubles tournaments will
start to-day, and as many *of the teams
are evenly matched there should be some
Interesting contests. ' Probably the best
match In the preliminary round will be
between Harry Rolfe and '" Herbert
Schmidt and Georse Janes land Fred
Adams. ,

TRAGEDY MARS
TROTTING RACE
MissT Catherine Wffies*
Mare ; Mac Drops
Dead at Charter Oak Park
OWXEE DEEPLY MOTED
Leaves the Ground Upon
Hearing of the Accident
to Her Favorite Animal
HARTFORD, Conn.. Sept. s.â The open-
Ing day of the Grand Circuit races at
Charter Oak Park ended In a tragedy
when Sadie Mac. the Canadian â¢ queen,'
dropped dead In the fourth heat of .the
$10,000 Charter Oak trot, the classic event
of the meet. She fell about 200 yards from
the finish, ,when making a desperate ef
fort to regain* a lead which she gallantly
held until rounding the last turn. Sadler
Mac seemed to have lost her strength
just at the period when her driver was"
urging her to do her best, but she was
exhausted and, dropping to the track,
rolled over and died instantly. A veter-
inary surgeon attributed death to a
broken blood vessel. Horsemen who had
been watching her declared she had acted
strangely all the afternoon.
At the tragic ' climax hundreds of men
thronged on the track. When Miss Katn^
erine Wilkes, the owner, who was In a
private box, heard of the mare's death,
she was deeply affected and left Imme
diately.
The finishes in the Charter Oak event
were heartbreaking and the heavy con-,
ditlon of the track made It hard for the
horses. Darkness prevented the finish of
the big event, after Angiola and Zephyr
had each . two heats. The big crowd
of 6000 was keyed up' to a high pitch
when the fourth heat waa finished.
Zephyr was In great form in the first two
htats, which were won in whipping fin
ishes, but tired undtr the strain, ami
Angiola finished in front in the third
and fourth In dashing style. Results:

Vr dttcrlc^-ation from the Julj- pcrccnta^o, the
figure was so much better than was anticipated
in the trade that heavy unloading of cotton
and a slump In the price of that commodity
followed. ThÂ« bear party in stocks was decid
edly upset by the various developments. Dur
ing tbe first hour of the market their buying
was on an enormous scale, a large proportion
of the day's total business being concluded
within that period. Prices held stubbornly
for some time after the abatement of the prin
cipal demand. But late in the day the mar
ket showed the effect of the satisfaction of the
demand from the shorts and prices sagged
away again. There was nothing in the money
rate to prohibit speculative activity, but the
outlook in that market continues the subject of
grave consideration. Low condition of bank
reserves and the exceeding activity, in all' lines
of business promise clearly the necessity for
additicnal liquidation of credits to supply the
new requirements. Hopes of- an- active. rinewal
of sufficient . demand \u25a0 for. the erpps to cause
profitable advance In prices are thus discour
aged and speculative enthusiasm therefor* kept
in check. Prices rallied, however, from the
ufterriuon depression, and the market closed

% CHICAGO/Hept. : 5. â Weakness developed in
th* wheat pit during the first hour of trading.
At the start sentiment was a trifle bullish as a
result, oi itrm cabies. Initial quotations on De
cember were a shade lower, to Wi&VAc higher at
itl'/ii&Sl^c. - On lair demand from commisaion
houses l>eeember touched til Â«4esi%c.. A" reac
tion, however, soon set in, resulting In a de
cline at over *Ac a bushel. Selling by caah
houses. Influenced 'by liberal receipts at Minne
apolis, was a.teature. Arrivals \u25a0of . wheat to
day at Minneapolis were S3B cars, compared
with i>so cars a year ago. ; Another factor, ap
parently overlooked earlier in the day, was the
lurge export -of wheat from Russia, shown in
the wor.d's .shipments. Notwithstanding nu
merous reportsof crop failure in Russia, ghlp
menta from that country during the preceding
' week were 43U0 bushels . out of a ; total." mo\-Â«
ment of a,304,0Â«X> bushels. The market was
further depressed by an increase of "1.410,000
bushels in the-amourit of breadstuff s on ocean
passage. \u25a0 Nearing the. close a decline of ab>ut
a cent In the price of cash wheat at Minneap
olis caused additional selling of option months
here." For. December \u25a0 the lowest po.ntof the
"day was reached at -81081 Vie. The market
closed weak, with December at 81%0, a loi>s of

Heavy accumulations of corn since Saturday
had a weakening ctffct : on the corn market.
"Another factor was a moderate decline In the
price of corn at Liverpool. December closed
*,#Vic lower at 43t4@43yic- .
" - A report that shipments of oats from Russia
would be small,- owing. to damage to. the. crop,
had a steadying efTect on the oats market. De
cember closed unchanged at 2tJ%c. â¢

PARTRIDGE
IS IN LINE
TO PRESIDE
Republican League Commit
tee Will Soon" Announce Its
Choice for Chairmanship
of Municipal Convention
TIME IS FIXED FOR
ANTI-RUEF CAUCUS
Several Sessions probable
to Consider Candidates
for the Office of Mayor
on Ticket the People Want
The anti-Ruef delegates to the Re
publican municipal convention, com
prising a large majority of the nom
inating body will meet in caucus at
Pioneer Hall, Tuesday evening, Sep
tember 12.
It is . probable . that several sessions
of' the caucus will be held. The nom
inee of the Republican party for
Mayor" of the city will be agreed upon
in the conference of the anti-Ruef ma
jority, and John S. Partridge will
doubtless be chosen chairman of the
convention. There Is no intention of
compromising with Ruef and his fol
lowers, as it is well known to every
man of ordinary common sense that
Ruef is in the Schmltz camp.
The regular anti-Ruef Republicans
won the battle at the primary and will
not hesitate to accept 'the responsibil
ity of putting' forward an anti-Ruef
candidate for Mayor.
.Two years ago the Republicans of
the campaign committee made a griev
ous political error in giving' their con
fidence to Ruef when the whole town
knew .that he was the special cham
pion and ardent supporter -of Schrnitz.
The error will not be "repeated by the
delegations elected under the auspices
ef the San Francisco Republican
League.
The session last night of the league's
committee on organization was attend
ed by George D. Clark, president;. Dan
iel A. Ryan, secretary; . Fairfax H.
Wheelan, David ' Rica, John. D. Daly, E.
J. Bowes, Richard?^. Welch -and? John
Lackmann. Arthur /G. .was also
present at, the conference. '" 'Â» â¢
There; will beianother meeting.of the
committee. this , evening ;or â¢,- to-morrow
night. 'Unless.' something. -of,an-.unex
pected nature V. occurs.-- announcement
will be made,- that the committee' favors
John S. Partridge <of V the- Thirty-fifth
District for chAirman : ;of. the conven
tion. Mr. Partridge > was vchalrman of
the Republican convention; two -years
ago and performed the duties of the
position in a highly acceptable manner.

KIPLING'S YALE
IN GOOD PLAY
Kiplingâ "The Light That Failed," by
any other name would come as credibly.
Least of all Kipling is Kipling here.
And it's oh for a Mrs. Hauksbee, -sad,
bad, adora"ble Mrs.' Hauksbee, for a
Krishna Mulvaney, for some , of the
pure, old Kipling mintage! one could
not help wishing- last night. The Al
cazar presents "The Light That Failed"
this week and. extremely well the Al
cazar presents' It.' n So good, too, is "The
Light That ' Failed"' that" a. little better
and it would be a -strong play. Even
as it is It holds .interest to the last,
through the strongly featured three
who make the story. But it is hardly
the "Kipling the stage 'cries" for. That
is a void yet to be supplied. V^.jv?
In England and also in "New York
Forbes" Robertson" presented the play,
which has been dramatized by George
Flemming. A prologue and three acts
it takes to the telling of the story. In
the prologue, that takes .place In the
Soudan, In the -war correspondents'
mess tent, one gets most of'the-Kip
ling "feel."
War cprrespondents sketching, scrib
bling, swearing, smoking, picking -blas
phemous . melodies out- of a banjo,; 101 l
aTJout waiting for something to happen.
Gun volleya ; from without supply., the ex
citement, and though* not dramatic there
ia a "stirring picture and atmosphere In
the scene.". \u25a0 Dick Heldar, \u25a0 â¢ full -of : fever,'
half-blind and . chafing . miserably at the
Inaction, is the central! figure.'
Maisie, at work in her, studio, is intro
duced with the next act. , The departing
model, tongue in her cheek as she looks
at , Maisle's work, gives the key rto \u25a0 the
"caliber of that mistaken young woman's
achievements. Her talk; with the. red
haired girl; develops Maisie'S: opinions on
the relations' of Herself and Art. ; One is
quite prepared by this .', time, 'assisted by
the-cleverly bad sketch! which Maisie is at
work -upon, - tOii agree â¢* with ; Heldar, 'who
comes in sto5 to tell her that . she ; can't paint
and that she would better give it up and
marry him.
Then comes a' vivid little scene between
the two, talk' only, :but talk .that: bites to
the last word. Sympathy see-saws . from
one to the other.',; Heldar jls right, but so
is Maisie. -'Neither* can'; see .the ""other's
viewpoint. Heldar^wants M.aisie, : : knows
her work Is hopeless, .tells her so/in ; a
beautiful; , blind,; :masculine ]\u25a0 fashion I that
any ; self-respecting 'young? wonian \ would
be ; boundv to resent. Â«.*' Maisie^ wants | fame."
Dick : has had It, she says, : she -wants itâ
because she i wants it.-:. Heldar says she
will never -have.' it. - Then, Maisle<says,
she hasUh'e right; to fail. .A'hard,; young
woman! but* her 1 hardness - very.' adroitly
opposed . to I tne exacting ; , masculinity -of
Dick. .> Furthers light -on Maisie and I Dick

Supervisors Inform Mayor
He Has No Jurisdiction
â¢ as to Building Schools
NO CONFERENCE HELD
Bent Only Member of Board
to Show Up and Executive
Is Very Much r Put Out
The Finance Committee of .the Board
of Supervisors refused, to attend "the con
ference > that ? Mayor : Schmltz ;; had i called
for r yesterday .to ' consider ; the matter of
expediting; the construction 1 of .; hew school,
buildings under ; the bond: issue, giving as
its ' reason : that < the ; executive t had no Ju
risdiction sin â¢ the : situation whatever.
â¢ The .- following ; was ithe^ communication,
mi somewhat ; veiled \u25a0 language, - thel Super
visors cent.to the S Mayor : r vv :
"Mr..Geo. B.Keane, Mayor's Secretary-
Dear Sir: Your communication ' of the Ist

of the Finance Committee, has received^our

we | beg to say - that i the matter therein re
ferred to , is within \ the jurisdiction , of the
Board, of Supervisors^ which, will convene
on Monday: next,*; at which, time {thai sub
ject' matter, of : " your t communication will
be -investigated, andi that there^wlll ;be
no further, delay we. would .'recommend
that the Board ; of Public .Works - present
to â¢ the board " the plans and speclflcat ionso ns

/, tee, Board of Supervisors." .
The Mayor was much' put out at- the
attitude of ' the Supervisors. : Only, one
of them, Bent, appeared' ln response to
the" call for the conference. ' HiÂ« Honor
took. issue witJi the statement that the
matter is within the Jurisdiction : of the
Board \u25a0 of Supervisors and cited ' the
opinion of the City Attorney to the
effect that the : actual construction of
the schoolhouses lies with the : Board
of Works fand Board of ?'\u25a0 Education.
Then! he 'said unpleasant; things about
the. defiant members of. the board, after
which" he called the conference off. â¢
: City. Architect; Shea reported to the
Mayor, the lowest bid received^ for the
building: of .the' Washington Grammar
School â¢was;-J216,000 1 and he.'did : not
anticipate that future; bids wouldi.be
any . lower unless the granite and : stone
work. were. eliminated from the speci
fications, .which, would reduce .the fig
ure somewhat, j Shea that
as the purchase price of .some of J ; the
school sites had exceeded the " sums ' set
aside In the bond issue, the same prin
ciple might be applied to the erection
of the buildings where . the actual cost
exceeded the estimates made. The sum
of Jllfi.ftOO Is available for the . Wash
ington School. Shea : said the ; school
buildings ' should be absolutely fireproof
and ho would not advise , the elimination
of / the, steel' roof .'and Iron 'stairway to
reduce the cost.' : . \u25a0 - .'. \u25a0â¢ '.\u25a0\u25a0"" ' ; .
The Mayor- said the question. to be'de
clded was whether the- specifications
should.'be 'modified to "conform ,* to ; the
low -appropriations, 'or ';"- whether \u25a0 ; the
specifications should â¢ hi . adhered . to and
the Supervisors be asked to, supply^the,
deficiency .'by ,^a supplementary .". bond
issue j or; otherwise. The i Mayor ; said ;' he
was lnT favor; of 'sticking to. the original
plans,,. and in' this he. was upheld by Pres
ident. Roncovleri of the Board of Educa
tion. "::'\u25a0\u25a0'.;' .;* "..". \u25a0. : ' \u25a0' . ' ' â¢'.'.'. \u25a0 * \u25a0:\u25a0 ,' \u25a0'\u25a0'\u25a0 ...
The. Mayor-contended - that â¢ ex-City
Engineer : Grunsky's '^estimates of cost
are from 25,t0"80 per,cent'to6 : low j , and
were nearly 100 per cent too low in. the
case of the" Washington | School. ! Com
missioner,'; of J.Works Aigeltinger, , sug
gested that. the proposals be segregated
so that leach ] particular kind of '. work
in connection .with ithe^buildlng could
be bid upon.' The proposition met -.with
favor, and after furthers dlscussion : It
was agreed that the ; Board of \u25a0 Works
advertise for three style of bids forthe
school. .The first will be based on the
original, plans in the, hope ;that a lower
bid than $218,0D0 may be secured.; The
second proposal will be by.-^ segregated
bids for the plumbing/brick work,<car
penfcr work, etc. . The third '.^ill-. be on
modified plans by : the.eliminationVvof

which will materially .reduce the .cost.

SHAM CITIZEN
AGAIN APPLIES
John Gordon Hitchfield, Who
Was : Denaturalized, Now
Has Bona Fide Witnesses
DEVLIN MAKES /PKOTEST
IJnique Point as to Whether
: Foreig^ner Once Imposing
on Law Can Be Admitted
- ; "If an 'alien . has ' obtained naturallza-^
tion . by ; fraud," and .'that 'j naturalization'
should be canceled, can he again bÂ« ad
mitted, to 'citizenship upon f uliil 1 ins the
requirements, of \ the - ; law?"^ This .was
the issue presented at the morning* ses
sion -of United States" Circuit Judge
Morrow's; court .yesterday, when John
Gordon -Hitchfleld made application" for
citizenship papers/
\i Mr. Hitchfleld is a subject of i King
Edward of,- Great Britain, and ; follows
the ' sea f or ) his ; livelihood. ,He was one
of < those -who became "naturalized by
means of the evidence of;two witnesses
who - had not known him /as lons as
they; swore they had and'was later de
naturalized.. "
; Now he comes forward with bona flde
witnesses arid: seeks citizenship, o- .
Upon Judge 1 Morrow's .-, decision will
depend the â¢ cases of several hundred
alien mariners whom the secret service
agents are rounding up... â¢..
Mr. 'â¢ Hitchfleld's application was con
tested _*by' United States District Attor
ney Devlin. . Mr. Devlin 'â¢ argued,^ as ;to
other phases, that if a sailor, comes to
San Francisco and': declare."? his ' Inten
tion to become a citizen, but before be
ing admitted 'to 'citizenship takes ser
vice on a foreign vessel, the time spent
in such /service cannot be - computed
legally as a part of .his < time of resi
dence. Such acceptance 'of emp.loy
ment on: a foreign vessel, ts Indicative
of an intention to abandon his desire
of becoming an American citizen.
In a rather desultory . discussion
which followed. Judge Morrow \ re
marked that he had always held that
the- question of residence;, was one. of
intention; that a man who filed his cer
tificate of intention must ; have had a
continuous intention during all the
time required by the statute, but It did
not follow necessarily- that the appli
cant must remain In the United States
all the time. Temporary absence from
the country would not alone divest him
of. his right to- become a citizen.
j Mr. Devlin said .that, it -would depend
upon the fact; whether the. foreign ves
sel exacted an oath of allegiance -from
its sailors. He also called attention
to the, fact -that a sailor under a for
eign \u25a0 flag usually was ; considered a citi
zen of the country. represented by that
flag. "â¢-"
'Judge Morrow will give -the matter a
further hearing on October 2. '
â¢ United 1 States ' Secret Service .Agent
John , H. \u25a0 Helms bagged another trio of
illegally naturalized sailors yesterday.
They- are John . P. - Swansen. Theodore
Olsen and Max . Gotzmann. Swansen
was -.naturalized by Superior \u25a0 Judge
