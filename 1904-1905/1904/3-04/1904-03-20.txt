for her room, followed by the strange
man and the, two boys.

He turned toward her and threw up
his head as a person does who is going
to epeak emphatically and at length.
Only in raising his head his eyes re
mained on the ground.
"My dear girl," he said in a suave
tone, "you've lived all your life in
these small, half-civilized California
towns, and there are many things about
life in larper and more advanced com

just told you I loved 'you, and you

"We could go easily, witho-ut making

He heard her dress rustle as she in
stinctively drew away from him.
For the first time there was a faint
note of uneasiness in her voice. Though
his glance was still bent on the fire,
he knew that she was no longer smil
ing.
She looked at him with a girl's
charming embarrassment at the first
fitting of this word to any breathing
man. and blushed deeply arid beauti
fully. Ess*:x felt he mu^t disillusion

Still avoiding her eyes, which he

"Oh, yes, we could."
"How â I don't understand?"
"Why not?" she answered. "You
know he was to send me. I promised
my mother I would let him take care

"But you mustn't do that," he said
with a tudden authoritative change of

happily:

"Nicanor lay i!cad in hU harness." â Mac

The day broke overcast and damp,
one of those depressing days of still,
soft "gray^ness that usher In .the early
ralnj, when the air has a heavy close
ness and the skies seem td sag with the
weight of moisture that is Blow to fall.
There was much to do yet in the rifled
cottage, Mariposa rose to it wan and
heavy-eyed-v The whirl of her own
thoughts during the , long, sleepless
night had not soothed her shame and
distress. She found herself working,
doggedly, with her heart ; like lead in
her breast," and her mouth 1 : feeling .dry
as the scene of the evening before
pressed forward to her attention. She
tried to keep it in the background, but
it would not down. Words, looks, sen
tences, kept welling up to the ""surface
of hcrinlnd, coloring her cheeks with a
miserable crimson,'- filling, her Being
with a sickness of despair. The mem
ory of the kisses followed her from
room to room,' and! task to task. She;
felt " them on her lips as she : moved
about, the lips that' had never known
the kiss, of a lover, arid now seemed
soiled and smirched forever. â¢ .
After" luncheon the red lacquer cabi
net went away. She watched it off as
the last remnant of: the old life. She
felt strangely indifferent to what yes
terday she thought would be so many :
unbearable wrenches... Finally nothing
was left but her own few possessions,
gathered together. In a corner of the
front room â two ' trunks, a screen, a
table, a long, old-fashioned mirror and
some pictures. Yesterday morning she
had bargained with a cheap carter,
picked up on the street corner, to take
them for a dollar, and now she sat
\vaitlnjj for him, . while the day grew
CHAPTER X
Mariposa stood on the inside of her
room door, holding the knob and trying
to suppress, her "breathing that she
might hear clearly. She heard his
steps, echoing on the bare floor with
curious distinctness. They were, slow
at first; then there was decision in
them; then the hall door banged. She
leaned against the panel, her teeth
pressed on her underllp, her head bowed
c-n her breast.
"Oh. how could he? how could he?"
she whispered.
A tempest of anguish shook her. l3he
crept to the bed and lay there, her face
buried in the pillow, motionless and
dry-eyed, till dawn!
He suddenly, but gently, attempted
to take her in his arms. Though she
did not see she felt his tmich. and with
a cry of horror tore herself away;
rushed past him into the. adjoining
room, and from that into her bedroom
beyc-nd. The bang of the closing door
fell coldly upon Essex's ear.
He stood for a moment listening and
considering. He had a fancy that she
might come back. The house was ab
solutely silent. Then, no sound break
ing its stillness, no creak of an open
ing door echoing through its bare
emptiness, he walked out into the hall,
put on his hat and overcoat and let
himself out. He was angry and dis
gusted. In his thoughts he inveighed
against Marlposa's stupidity. The un
fortunately downright explanation. had
aroused her wrath, and he did not
know how deep that might be. Only as
he recalled her ordering him from the
room he realized that it was not the
fictitious rage he had seen before and
understood.
"Oh, don't do that," he said tenderly,
approaching her. "Does my love make
you unhappy? A half -hour ago it was
not like this.". ylV-
"You're right," she said. "I don't un
derstand about life as you dp. T didn't
understand that a man could talk to a
wc-miin as you have done to me and
then strike her such a blow. It'a too
new to me. to learn quickly. I â Iâ can't
âunderstand yet. I can't say anything
to you. only that I /don't ever want to
eee you, or hear you. or think of you
again."
"My dearest girl," he said, going a
step tc-ward her, "don't be so severe.
You're like a tragedy queen. Now,
what have I done?"
"I didn't think that a man could have
the heart to v/ound any woman so â any
living creature, and one who cared as I
did â " she stopped, unable to continue.
"But I wouldn't wound you for the
world. Haven't I just told you I loved
you?" iÂ£-: J
"Oh. go," she said, backing away
from him. "Go! 'go away. Never come
near me again. You've debased and
humiliated me forever, and I've kissed
you and told you I loved you. " Why
can't I creep into some corner and die?"
"Mariposa, my darling." he said,
raising his eyebrows with a theatrical
air of incomprehension, "what is it?
I'm quite at sea. You speak to me as
if I'd done you a wrong, and all I've
done is to offer you my deepest devo
tion. Does that offend you?"
"Yes, horriblyâ horribly!" she cried
furiously. "Go â go out of my sight. If
you've got any manliness or decency
left, go â I can't bear any mare." . 5
She pressed her hands on her face arid
turned from him. Â¦
She looked at him straight in the
eyes. The pain and bewilderment had
left her face, leaving it â¢ .white and
tense. He realized that she was not
going to weep and make moanâ the
wound had gone deeper. He had
stnbbed her to the heart.
"Oh. I want to," he said with a propi
tiatory shrug. "Of course 1 ,\vant to.
But one can't always do what one
wants. Under the circumstances, as I
tell you, marriage ie impossible."
Khe could say nothing for a moment,
the first moment of cumpre
hension. T!isn she said in si low voice,
still with her senses scattered, "And I
thought you meant it all."
"Meanfwhat? that I love you?-Don't
you trumme? Don't you believe me?
You must acknowledge I understand
life better than you do."
she had forced him to this banal ex
planation. There wore times when her
stupidity could be exasperating.
She was very pale, her eyes dark, her
nostrils expanded. j On her face was an
expression of pitiful bewilderment and
distress. V Â¦'Â¦ Â¦
"Thenâ themâ you didn't > want to
marry me?" she stammered with trem
bling lips.
The man stepped into the hall: and
looked up at her. He had a singularly
red and Impudent /ace. '
"Not till I get my.^.'o dollars and/ a
half," he said. Â¦ ,;
"Two dollars and a half?" echoed
Mariposa in alarm, for a dollar was be
ginning to loo*- larger to her than it
"It'syour things," yelled the .boys.
"Tell him to bring thenv up," .said
Mariposa, who was now at, the stair-,
head herself. .
Further revelations were stopped by
another ring at the bell. Visitors were
evidently rare, for everybody but Mari
posa flew, to the hall and precipitated
themselves down the stairs. In the gen
eral interest the recent battle .was for
gotten, the rebel earning his pardon by
getting to the door before anyjaneelse.
The newcomer was Marlposa's express-'
man. She had already, seen through the
window the uncovered cart with: her
few belongings glistening with rain.
The driver, a grimy youth -in a
steaming blouse,; was standing in the
doorway with the wet receipt flapping
in his hand, â¢"'vi'" â¢- â¢."Â¦Â¦â¢â¢
"Grandma slaves, too," said the rebe}
*on the stairway; "she slaves more'n
you do, and Uncle Gam slaves the
â¢most.".
"That's the way they , always act,"
said Mrs. Garcia despondently, pushing
up her bang so that she could the bet*
ter see- her new guest. "It's no picnic
having no husband and having to slave
for everybody."
"He did break it," said the other hgy
suddenly. "He opened the back door of
it and stuck a hairpin in." .Â¦> "'â¢
Mrs. Garcia made a rush at her Bon
with the evident intention of adminis
tering corporal punishment on the spot.
But with a loud, derisive shotit, he
eluded her and dashed ~ through the
doorway. Safe on the stairs, he cried
defiantly: v ;-'.^,s.'-> -
"I ain't done it, and no one can prove
it.". '-y Â¦!:-Â¦'â¢-. Â¦ .- ,'-y
"Your clock don't go," said the cher
ubic boy in a loud voice. "I've tried to
make it, but it only ticks a minute and
then stops."
"There!" said Mrs. Garcia, with a
gesture of collapsed hopelessness, "he's
been at your clock! I knew he would.'
Have you broken her clock?" fiercely to
the boy. >;; :
"No, I ain't," he returned, not in the
least overawed by the maternal on
slaught. "It were broke when it came."
To-day it dripped with the rest of the
World. As Mariposa let the gate bang
the impact shook a shower from the
tree, which fell c-n her as she , passed
beneath. It seemed to her a bad omen
and added to the almost terrifying sen
sation of gloom that was Invading her.,
Her ring at the bell brought Che
whole Garcia family to the door and
the hall. A child of tenâ the elder of
the yo-ung Mrs. Garcia's* boysâ opened
it. He was 1 ' in the condition of moist
ure and mud consequent on a game of
baseball on the way home from school.
Behind him crowded a smaller boyâ of
a dherubic beauty â arrayed in a very,
dirty sailo-r blouse,- with a still dirtier
wide white cohar, upon which . hung
locks of wispy yellow hair. Mrs. Gar
cia, the younger, came drearily for
ward. She was a thin, pretty, slattern
ly, young woman, very baggy at the
waist, and with the same wtspy yellow,
hair as her son, which she wore In. the
popular bang. It had been smartly .
curled in the morning, but the damp';
had shown it no\ reapect, and it hung..'
down limply nearly into her eyes. Back.;:;
of her, in the dim reaches of/the hall;';',
Mariposa saw the grandmother, the^.
strange old< Spanish; woman,/who spoke;;
no .EhglisJVv'Sh^ looked very <^ld, and*,
small, and was wrtnkled like a
But as she/ericc-untered the girl's' mis- \
erable gaze 'she gave her a gentle" reasr
suring. smile, full *of that curious; pa
tient sweetness 'which comes v In the
faces of the old who have lived kindly.
â¢ The younger members of the family
escorted the new arrival upstairs.' She
had seen her room before, had already
placed therein her piano and many, of
her smaller ornaments, but its bleak
ness struck her anew. She stopped on
the threshold, looking at its chill, half
furnished extent with a sudden throt
tling sense of homesickness. It was a
large room, evidently once the state
bedroom of the house, signs of its past Â¦Â¦
glory lingering in the elaborate -gilt
chandelier, the. .white wallpaper,
strewed with golden wheat-ears, and
the white marble ( mantelpiece, with
carvings of fruit it- the sides. Now she;
saw with renewed clearness' of vision
the threadbare carpet, with a large Ink- .
stain by the table, the rocking-chair:
with one arm gone, the place on*Â£he
wall behind the sofa where the heads .
of previous boarders had left their,
mark.
The servant, who was. to. close and
lock the cottage, begged her to. go, ",
promising to- scjeto the 'shipping "of the
last load. Mariposa needed no special^
urging. ' She felt Â¦ that an afternoon,
spent in that dim parlor, looking out
through the bay-window at the fine
elant of }.he rain, would drive her mad.
There was no promise of cheer at the.
Garcia boarding-house, but it was, at
least, not haunted. with memories. "... : .
A half-hour' later, with the precious
desk, containing the marriage certifi
cates and Shackleton'8 gift of money,
under her arm, she was climbing the
hills from Sutter street to that part of
Hyde street in which, the Garcia house
stood. She eyed it ' with deepening
gloom as it revealed itself through the
thin rain. It was a house which even
then was getting old. standing back
from the street on top of a bank, which
was held in pluctf by u wooden bulk
head, surmounted by a low balustrade.
A gate gave access through this, and a
flight, of rc-tting wooden steps led by
zigzags to* the house. The lower story
was skirted ' in front by a balcony,,
which, after the fashion of early San
Francisco architecture, .was encased in
glass. Its roof above slanted up, to the
two lc-ng windows of the front bed
room.. .The popper-tree, of which Mar
iposa had epoken to Essex, was suffi
cient to tell the age of the property, and
to give beauty and picturesqueness- to
the rams-hackle old place. It had
reached an unusual growth and threw,
a fountain c-f drooping foliage over the
balustrade and one long limb, upon 'the
balcony roof. 'Â¦-. . .,-â¢
duller outside, and the . fog began to
Bift itself into fine rain. . Â¦ .
to whom the usages of society were
matters of indifference. He entered
the room without permission or apol
ogy and stood looking inquiringly
about him. his glance passing from the
bed to the fvide. old-fashioned bureau,
the rocking-chair with its arm off and
the ink-stain on the carpet. As the
men entered with their burdens, he"^
said:
"You look as if you'd bp short of
chairs here. I'll see that you get an
t-ther rocker to-morrow."
Mariposa wondered if Mrs. Garcia
was # about to end her widowhood and
thi3 was the happy man.
He stood about as the men set down
the luggage, and watched the transfer
of the dollar from ilariposa's white
hand to the dingy one of. her late ene
my. The boys also eyed this transac
tion with speechless attention, evident
ly anticipating a second outbreak of
hostilities. But Deace had been re
stored and would evidently rule as
long as the sunburned man in the
shirt-sleeeves remained.
This he appeared to Intend doing. He
suggested a change in the places of one
or two of Mariposa/s pieces of furni
ture, and showed her how she could usÂ© ,
her screen to hide the bed. He looked^
annoyed over a torn strip of loose wall
paper that" huug dejected, revealing a
long seam of 'plaster N like a seared
scar. Then he went to- the window and
pushed back the curtains of faded rep.
"There's a nice view from here on
sunny days down Into, the garden."
Mariposa felt she must show Interest, *
and went to the window, too. The pane
was not clean, and the view com
manded nothing but the splendid foun
tain-like foliage of the pepper-tree and
below a. sodden strip of garden in which
limp chrysan them urns hung their
heads, while a ragged nasturtium vine
tried to protest its vigor by flaunting a
few blossoms from the top of the fence.
It seemed to her the acme of forlorn
ness. The crescendo of the afternoon's
unutterable despondency had reached
Its climax. Her sense of desolation
welled suddenly up into overwhelm
ing life. It caught her by the throat.
She made a supreme effort, and said in
a shaken voice: '.-'- Â»T
"U looks rather damp now." A
Her companion turned from the win-i
dow.
"Here, boys, scoot," he said to the
two boys who were attempting to open
the trunks with the clock key. "You've
got no business hanging round here.
Go down and'study your lessons."
They obediently left the room. Mari
posa heard their jubilantly clamorous
descent of the stairs. She mada no at
tempt to leave the window, or to speak
to the man, who still remained moving
about as if looking for something. The
light was growing dim in the dark win
try day, but the girl still stood with
her face to the pane. She knew that if
the tears against which she fought
should come there would be a deluge
of them. Biting her lips and clenching
her hands, she stood peering out.
speechless, overwhelmed by her
â¢wretchedness.
Presently the man said, as If speak
ing to himself:
"Where the devil are the matches?
Elsie's too careful for anything."
She heard' him feeling about on
shelves and tables, and after a moment
said: .
"Did you see where the match^it
were? I want to light the gas."
"There aren't any," she answered
withqut turning.
He gave a suppressed exclamation,
and, opening the door, left the room.
"With the withdrawal of his restrain
ing presence the tension snapped. Mar
iposa sank down in the chair near the
window, and the tears poured from her
eyes, tears in torrential volume, such
as her mother had shed twenty-five
years before in front of Dan Moreau's
cabin.
Her grief seized her and swept her
away. She- shook with It Why could
she not die and escape from this hide
ous world? It bowed her like a reed
before a wind, and she bent her face
on the chair arm and trembled and
throbbed.
She did not hear the door open, nor
know that her solitude was again in

side* her. Then she started up, stran
gled with sobs and indignation.
â¢'Is it you again?" she cried. "Can't*
you see how miserable I am?"
-â¢ "I saw it the moment I came out of

quietly. "I'm sorry I disturb you. I

"crying. Don't bother about me; I'm
going to light the flre."*
She obeyed him, too abject in her mis
j ery to care. He lit all the sases in the
* gilt chandelier, and then knelt before
â¢the fireplace. Soon the snapping of the
wood contested the silence with the
small, pathetic noises of the woman's
weeping. She felt â at first withont con
sciousness â the grateful warmth of the
blaze. Presently she removed the wad
of saturated handkerchief from her
face. The room was inundated by a
flood of lisht, the leaping gleam of the
flames licking the glaze of the few old
fashioned ornaments and evoking un
certain gleams from the long mirror
standing on the floor in the corner.
The man wa3 sitting before the flrÂ«.
He had his coat on now, and Maripo<n3f
could see that he was tall and powerful,
a bronzed and muscular man or about
thirty-five years of age, wnh a face
tanned to mahogany color, thick brown
hair and a brown mustache. His hand,
as it rested on his knee, caught her eye;
it was well formed, but worn as a la
borer's.
"Don't you want to come and sit near
the fire?" he said, without moving his
head.
She murmured a negative.
"I see that your- clock la all off," he
continued. . "There's something the

evening." Jfljffijjji

of French gilt, one of the many pres

thought that he was going. At the
idea of being again left to herself her
Wretchedness rushed back upon h^J
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU

TOMORROW'S TANGLEFor two daj's after her hysterical out
burst Mariposa kept her room, sick in
body and mind. The quick succession
of nerve-shattering events, ending with
the death of Shackleton, seemed to
stun her. She lay on the sofa, white
and motionless, irresponsive 'even to
the summons of the boys, who
drummed cheerfully on her door as
they came home from school.
Fortunately for her, solitude was as
difficult to find in that slipshod men
age as method or order. "When the
boys were at school, young Mrs. Garcia,
In the disarray that attended the ac
complishment of her household tasks,
mounted to her first-floor boarder and
regaled her with mingled accounts of
past splendors and present miseries.
Mrs. Garcia spoke freely of her hus
band and the affluence with which he
had surrounded her. The listener, look
ing at the faded, blond prettlness of
her foolish face, wondered how the
Juan Garcia that Gamaliel Barron had
described could have loved her. Mari
posa had yet to learn that nature mates
the strong men of the world to the fee
ble women, in an effort to maintain an
equilibrium.
Once or twice the old senora came
upstairs, carrying some dainty in a
covered dish. She had been born at
Monterey, and had come to San Fran
cisco as a bride In the late fifties, but
had never learned English, speaking
tbe sonorous Spanish of her girlhood
to every one she met, whether It was
understood or not. Even in the com
plete wreck of fortune and position. In
which Mariposa saw her, she was a
fine example of the highest class of
Spanish Californian, that once brilliant
and picturesque race, careless, simple,
lazy, happy, lords of a kingdom whose
value they never guessed, possessors of
limitless acres on which their cattle
grazed.
The day after Shackleton's death
Mrs. Willers appeared, still aghast at
the suddenness of the . castatrophe.

aware that there were several people
grouped on the balcony, their forms
dimly visible through the grimy glass
and behind the rampart of long
stemmed geraniums, that grew there in
straggling neglect. The opening of the
outer door let her In on them. She
started and slightly changed color
when she saw that one of the figures
was that of Gamaliel Barron. He was
sitting on the arm of a dilapidated
rocker, frownlngly staring at Benito,
the younger Garcia boy, against whom,
it appeared, a charge of some moment
had Just been brought. The case was
being placed before Barron, who evi
dently acted as Judge, by a person
Mariposa had not seen before â a tall,
thin' young man of some thirty years,
with a stoop In the shoulders, a shock
of fine black hair, and a pair of very
soft and beautiful blue eyes.
They were so preoccupied in the
matter before them that no effort was
made to Introduce the stranger to Mar
iposa, though Barron offered her his
armchair, retiring to a seat on the bal
cony railing, whence he loomed
darkly severe, from amoni the strag
gling geraniums. Benito, in his sailor
collar and wispy curls, maintained an
air ' of i smiling innocence, but Miguel,
the elder boy, who was an interested
witness, bore evidence of uneasiness of
mind in the strained attention of the
face turned toward Barron.
Mariposa "paused, her hand on the
back - of 'Â¦Â¦"Â¦ the rocking-chair. Benito
had already inserted himself into her
affections. She looked from one -tÂ»
the other to ascertain his off ens*.
Both men were rerardlrig the culprit,
Barron with .frowning disapproval,
the other with eyes full of amuse
ment. " It ' was he who proceeded ' to
state the case against the accused:
its palaces, the girl paused and looked
about her. The great buildings were
new, and stood, vast, awe-compelling
monuments to ' California's material
glory- Their^ owners were still trying
to make themselves comfortable in
them. Perched high above the city. In
these many- windowed aeries, they
could look down on the town they had
seen grow from a village in 'the days
when they, too, had been young, poor
and struggling. What memories must
have crowded their minds as they
thought of the San Francisco they had
first seen, and the San Francisco they
saw now; of themselves as they had
been then, and as they were now!
Maripcsa leaned against' a convenient
wall top and looked down. The city lay
clear-edged and gray in the cup made
by. the encircling hills. It had not yet
thrown out feelers toward the Mission
hills, and they rose above the varied
sweep of roof and chimney, In undu
lating greenness, flecked here and there
by the white dot of a cottage. The gir
dle of the bay shone sapphire-blue on
this day of still sunshine. 'From Its
farther side other hills were . revealed,
each peak and shoulder clear cut
against Its " neighbor and defining
themselves in a crumplÂ«d, cobalt line
againr' the faint sky. Over all Mount
DIavolo rose, a purple point, pricking
up above the green of newly, grassed
hills, about whose feet hung a white
fringe of little towns.
Turning her eyes again on the ' de
scending walls and roofs, the watcher
saw a long cortege passing, soberly be
tween gray house-fronts on a
street a few blocks below her.\As she'
looked the boom of , solemn music rose
to her. It was , funeral, and - one of
unusual length,- she thought, . m her
eyes caught ?. the low line of carriages

It was, indeed, a wonderful day.
Through her parted curtains she saw
details of the splendor in the bits of
turquoise sky between the houses, and
t"he vivid greens of the rain-washed
gardens. When the sun was well up,
and the opened windows let in delicious
earth scents, she put on her j hat and
jacket and went out, turning her steps
to that high spine of the city along the
crest of which California street runs.
Has any place been found where
there are finer days than those ', San
Francisco can show in winter? "The
breaks in the rain," old Calif ornlans
call them. It is the rain that gives
them their glory, for the whole world

Then he clattered down the stairs.
Mariposa had not seen him since their
supper together. Every morning he
had stopped and called a greeting of
some sort through the door. She
shrank from meeting him again. The
extraordinary remark she had made to
him haunted her. The only thing that
appeased her was the memory "of his
face, in which there was no conscious
ness of the meaning of her words,. only
consternation and amaze at the effect
his news had produced.
"First-rate. Couldn't do better,

would put life into a mummy. I'd take
you out myself, but I've got to go
downtown and lasso one of my vic
tims."
tlon. But as she slowly dressed on the
morning of the third day, she felt a
slight ripple of returning life, a thaw
ing of these congealed faculties. She
heard the quick, decisive- step of Bar
ron In the hallway outside, and then
Its stoppage at her door, and his call
through the crack, "How are you this
morning? Better?" . -
"Much," the answered; "I'm getting
up."
"There's no use talking; I won't
take a boy who behaves that way. I'm
angry with you."
The man was absolutely grave and,
Mariposa . saw, spoke the truth when
he said he was angry. The boy was
about to plead, when probably a
knowledge of the hopelessness of such
a course silenced him. With a> flushed
face, he stood before tha tribunal
fighting with his tears, proud and si
lent. When he could no longer con
trol them he turned and .rushed into
the house, his bursting cobs Issuing
from the hallway. Miguel charged
after him.
"Oh. poor little fellow!" cried Mar
iposa; "how could you? Take him to
see the balloon; do, please."
Barron made no reply, sitting on tha
railing, frowning and abstracted. She
turned her eyes on the other man. He
was still smillnr.
"Barron's bringing up the bÂ«ya," he
said, "and he takes it hard."
"If I didn't," said the man from the
railing, "who would? Heaven knows
I don't want to disappoint the poor
"'Cause I said it first." replied his
brother calmly. "You didn't have no
time."
"Well," Benito," said Barron, "I've
got no use for you when you behave
that way. There's no excuse for it.
You've used the worst kind of lan
guage to a lady who was trymg to do
a decent thing. I won't take you this
afternoon."
The^change on Benito'a face was
sudden and piteous. Tha smile was
frozen on his lips, he turned crimson,
and said stammeringly. evidently
hardly believing his ears:
'To see the balloon? Oh, Uncle
Gam, you promised It for a week. Oh,
I'd rather see the balloon than any
thing. Oh. Uncle Gam!"
"I ain't nothing of the kind," said
Benito, smiling and showing his dim
ples. "I ain't done nothing more than
Miguel."
"I didn't tell her to go to the devil,"
exclaimed Miguel, in a loud, combat
ive'voice.
There was a moment's silence. The
younger boy continued to smile and
finger his knife, but it was evident he
was not so easy in his mind. The
stranger, now with difficulty restrain
ing his laughter, turned again to Mar
iposa and said:
"If the lady had been In any way
aggressive on the young gentleman's
comfort or convenience, it would not
have been exactly justifiable, but com
prehensible. But when you consider
that her sole desire was to save him
from eating something that would
make him sick, then you begin to real
ize the seriousness of the offense. Oh,
Benito, you're In a bad way, I'm
afraid!"

along just then, and she told him, and

llttla cuss, but somebody's got tÂ» try
and keeo him in order."
"Can't you punish him iomÂ« other
way? He's been talking about seeing
the balloon for days."
"I wish to goodness I'd somebody to
help me," said the Judge; moodily
"I'm not up to this sort of work. It
makes me feel the meanest thine that
walks to get up and punish a boy for
things that are just what I did when
I was the same age. But what's a
man to do? I can't see those children
CO to the devil."
The howls of Benito had been rising
loudly from the house for some min
utes. They now suffered a sudden
check; there wa3 a quick step in the
hall and Mrs. Garcia appeared in tha
doorway, red and angry. Benito was
at her side, eating a large slice of
cake.
"What d'ye mean. Gam Barron,"
she said in a high key, "by making my
son cry that way? Ain't you got no
better use for your time than to teasa
and torment a poor, little, helpless
boy, who's got no father to protect
him?"
f "I wasn't teasing him, Elsie," he an
swered quietly: "I only said I would
not take him out this afternoon be
cause he behaved badly."
"Well, ain't that teasing, when you
promised it for a week and more?
That's what I call a snide trick. It's
Just because you want to go some
where else. I know. And so you put
it off on that woman and the crab.
Much good she is, anyway; I know
her, too. Never mind, my baby,"
fondly to Benito. stroking his hair
with her hand, "mother'll take you to
see the balloon herself."
Benito. jerked himself away from
the maternal hand and said, with his
mouth full of cake:
"I don't want to go with you: I
want to go with Uncle Gam. He lets
me ride in the goat-cart and buy pea
nuts."
"You'll go with me," said Mrs. Gar
c!a with asperity, "or you'll not go at
all."
"I don't want to go with you." said
Benito, beginning to grow clamorous:
"I don't have fun when I go with
you."
"You'll go with me, or stay horns
shut up in the cupboard all after-"
noon."
"I won't: no, I won't."
Benito wa3 both tearful and en
raged. His mother caught his hand
and, holding it in a tense grip, bent
her face down to his and said with set
emphasis:
"Do you want to stay all afternoon
In the kitchen cupboard?"
He struggled to be free, reiterating:
"No, I don't, and I ain't coin' to. I
think you're real mean to me. I ain't
goln* to go nowhere with you."
"You mean, ungrateful little boy."
said hia parent, furiously, shaking tha
hand she h^ld. '.'Don't . talk back to
me. You'll so with me this after
noon and sec that balloon If I have to
drag you all the way. Yes, you will."
"I won't," roared Benito, now en
raged past all control; and In his
frenzy to escape he kicked at his
mother's ankles through her interven
ing skirts.
This vras too much for Mrs. Gar
cia's feelings as a mother. She toolc
her free hand and boxed Benito
smartly on the ear. Then for a mo
ment there was war. Benito kicked,
roaring lustily, whlla* hU mother
cuffed. The din of cornbat was loud
on the balcony, and several of tha
geranium pots wercf knocked over.
It remained for Barron to descend
from the railing and drag the boy
away from his wrathful parent.
"Here, stop kicking your mother,"
he said peremptorily; "that won't do
at all." -^
"Then make her stop slapping me,"
howled Benito. "Ain't I got a right
to kick back? I guess you'd kick all
right If you were slapped that way."
"All right," said his mother from
the doorway, "next time you come to
me, Benito Garcia, to be taken to tha
circus or the fair, you'll find out that
you've barked up the wrong tree."
"I don't care." responded Bdnito de
fiantly; "grandma or Uncle Gam will."
Five minutes after her Irate with
drawal she reappeared, calm, and
smiling, the memory of her recent
combat showing only In her height
ened color, and announced that lunch
was ready.
At lunch the stranger was Intro
duced to Mariposa. and she learned
that he was Isaac Plerpont, a singing
teacher living in the house.
"But." to Miguel, "she told you not
to touch it, that it was bad, didn't
slfe?"
"Yes," returned the elder boy, ex
ceedingly uncomfortable^ "She come
and leaned over the railing and hol-
"Well," said .Bsnito, swaying his
body from side to side, and fastening
his eyes on a knife he had carelessly
extracted from his pocket, "I didn't
see what she had to do with that crab.
It was all alone in the vacant lot.
How was we to know it was her
crab?"
Though the language used by the
accused was hard to associate with his
cherubic appearance, and had some
what shocked Mariposa's affection,
she could hardly suppress a smile.
Benito grinning, as If with pride at the
prowess he had shown in the encoun
ter with the strange female, looked at
his brother and emitted an explosive
laugh. Miguel, however, had more
clearly, guessed the seriousness of tha
offense, and looked uneasy. Barron
was regarding the younger boy with
unmoved and angry gravity. Mari
pora saw that the man was not in the
least inclined to treat the matter hu
morously.
"Did you really say that, Benito?"
he said.
The complainant paused, looked at
Mariposa with an eye In which she
saw laughter dancing, and said:
"That's rather a startling way for a
gentleman to speak to a lady, isn't
it?"
. "She leaned over tho railing and
said to me. Them little boys will be
sick if they eat that crab." "What
crab and what little boys?' I asked,
quite innocently, and she answered,
â¢Them little boys In the vacant lot!'
Then I turned and saw Benlto 'and
Miguel squatting in the grass among
the tomato cans and fragments of the
daily press, with a crab about as big as
a cart-wheel."
"We found it there." said Benito.
"It was just lying there."
" 'If they eat that crab.* the lady
continued, 'they'll be sick. It ain't
good. I threw it out myself. And
I've been hollerin* to them to stop, and

vlew, black and gloomy, with Its nod-'
ding tufts of feathers and somberly
caparisoned horses. Men walked be
hind it, and the measured music
swelled louder, melancholy and yet in
spiring.
Suddenly she realized whose it was.
The rich man was going splendidly to
rest.- .; ' ,' â¢
"My father!" she whisperexl to her
self. "My father! How strange!- how
strange!"
The cortege passed on, the music
swelling grandiosely and then dying
down into \fltful snatches of sweetness.
The long line of carriages moved slow
ly forward, at a crawling foot-pace. .
The daughter leaned on the coping of
the wall, watching this last passage
through the city of the father she had
known so slightly and toward whom
she felt a bitter and silent resentment.
She watched the nodding plumes till
they were out cf sight. How strangely
death had drawn together the three
that ' had separated! In six
months the woman and two men. tied
together by a twist of the hand of
fate, had been summoned, one after the
other, into tha darkness beyond. Would
they meet there? Maripc-sa shuddered
and turned away. The black plumes
had disappeared, but the music still
boomed fitfully in measured majesty.
The whistles were blowing for mid
day when she retraced her steps to the
Garcia house. As she mounted the
stairs â¢ to the front door -shÂ« became
Two days' rest restored Mariposa to
some sort of balance. She still felt
weak and stunned in heart and brain.

with Miss Moreau, the post of corre

signed to her. It had been the cumlml
nating point c-f Mrs. Willers* life strug
gle. Now all that lay shattered. Be It
said to her credit her disappointment
was more for the girl than for herself.
She knew that Shackleton had made no
definite .arrangements for the starting
of Mariposa on her way. All had been
in statu quo, attending on the daugh
ter's recovery from her mother's loss.
Now death had stepped In and forever
closed the door upon these hopes.
Mrs. Willers found Mariposa strange
ly apathetic. She had tried to cheer
her and#then b^id seen, to her amaze
ment, that the g\rl showed little disap
pointment. That the sudden blow had
upset her was obvious. She undoubted
ly looked ill: But the wrenching from
her hand of liberty, independence, pos
sibilities of fame, seemed to affect her,
little. She listened in silence to Mrs.
Willers' account of* \ the Bonanza's
King's death. As an "inside writer" on
The Trumpet the newspaper, woman
had heard every detail of the tragic
event discussed threadbare in the per
turbed office. Shackleton had\ been
found, as the paper stated, sitting at
his desk in the library at Menlo Park.
He had been writing letters when death
called him. His wife had "come in late
at night and found him thus, leaning
on the desk as if tired. It was an an
eurism, the doctors said. The heart
had been diseased for years. No one,
however, had had any idea of it Poor
Mrs. Shackleton was completely pros
trated. It â¢ was not newspaper talk
that she was in a state of collapse.
"And it was enc-ugh to collapse any
woman," said Mrs. Willers, with a
sympathetic wag of her head, "to cpme
in and find your husband sitting up- at
his desk stone dead. And a good hus
band,- too. It would have given me a
shock to have found Willers that way,
and even an obituary notice in the
paper of which he was prc-prietor could
hardly have called Willers a good hus
band."

jealous of the smoke wreaths that rise

michty picture, and the gray spirals
are hurriedly dispersed.
J.Iarlposa walked slowly, ascending
by a zigzag course from street to
street, idly looking at the houses end
gardens as she passed. People of con-,
slderation- had for some ; time been on
the move from South Park to this side
of town. The streets through which
the, young girl's course led her were
now the gathering place .of the city's
successful citizens. On , the heights
above them, the new millionaires were
raising palaces, which they were emu
lating on the ascending slopes. Great
houses reared themselves en every sun
ny corner. The architecture of the.bay
windowed mansion with the two lions
sleeping on the front steps had sup
planted that of the dignified, plastered
brick fronts, with the long lines of win
dows opening on wrought-lron bal
conies. ..- Â¦ â¢
These huge wooden Â¦ edifices housed
the wealth and fashion of the city.

brows, looking down from a vantage

sign c-f life or occupation ' about Â¦ it.

Cood of tears v.ould begin again.
"Oh, don't go," she said, with the im
ploring urgency of old friendship. "I'm
. eo terribly depressed. Don't go."
Her lips trembled, her swollen eyes
v. crc without light cr beauty. She was
cs distinctly unlovely as a handsome
woman can be. The men, however, did
not lc<fk ct her. He had opened the
t^cr of the clock and was rtudying its
ir.lRrnal machinery. He answered
quietly:
"I'll have to eto now for a while. I
must finish my letter. It's got to go
, out to-ni,;ht. but I was going to ask
you if you wouldn't like to have your
supper up here? It's now a little after

you don't mind, l'li bring mine up, too.
I just take tea end some bread and but
ter and jam and stuffâ whatever Elsie
h^i pens to have round. If you'd like
it. ycu fix up the table and get things
into Â£cnc sort of shape."
He walked toward the door. With
the handle in his hand he said:
"You don't mind my taking mine up
here, too, do you? If you do, say so."
"ICo, I don't ir-ind," said Maxipcsa, in
the stifled voice of the weeper.
When he had gone she listlessly tried
to create sc-zne kind of order in the
â¢ haotic room. She feit exhausted and
indifferent. Once she found herself
looking at her watch with a sort of
heavy desire to have the time pass
quickly. She dreaded her loneliness.
She caught a glimpse of herself In the
chimr.cy-piece el-Â£s and felt neither
ehame nor disgust at her unsightly ap
pearance.
At six o'clock she heard the quick,
decisive step in iho hall that earlier In
the afternoon had brc-ken in on her
v. rar-sle with the expressman. A knock
Â¦ c arr.e on the door that sounded exceed
ingly like a kick bestowed under diffi
culties. She opened it, and her new
friend entered bearing a large tray set
forth with the paraphernalia of a cold
supper and with the evening paper laid
on top. He put it en the cleared table,
and together they lifted off its con
tents, and set them forth. There was
cold meat, jam, bread and butter, a
brown pottery teapot with th-j spout
broken and two beautiful cups, delicate
and richly decorated. Then they sat
down, one en each side of the table,
and the meal began.
Mariposa did not care to eat- Sitting
uiider the blaze of the gilt chandelier,
with the firelight gilding one side of her
flushed and disfigured face, she poured
out the tea, while her companion at?
tscked the cold meat with good appe

Coned herself guiltily regarding the
man opposite, as she surreptitiously
tried to eop uz> with a napkin the
streams of tea it s*nt over the table

He appeared to ha\ e the capacity for
seeing anything that occurred in his
vicinity.
"Never mind the teapot," he said,
with his mouth full; "it always does
that. It's no good getting a new one.
I think the boys break them. Elsie
says they play boats with them in the
bathtub."
Mariposa made no reply, and the
â¢ meal progressed in silence. Presently
h^r vis-a-vis held out his cup for a sec
Â¦ -nd filling.
"What beautiful cups." she said. "It
would be n. pity to break them."
'They're grandma's. They're the on
ly two left. Grandma had some stun
ning thing's, brought round the Horn
by her husband in the early days, be
fore the Grinpo came. He was a great
:r.an in his day, Don Manuel Garcia."
"I.-- she your "grandmother, too?"
Maiijxjsa asked. It seemed natural to
put pointblank questions to this man,
vino so completely swept aside the
sma!k-r conventions.
"Mine? Oh, Lord, no. My poor old
prar.ny died crossing the plains in '43.
I was there, but I don't remember it.
I call old lady Garcia grandma, be
cause I'm here so much, and because
1 look upon them as my family."
"Do you live here always?" asked
Mariposa, looking with extinguished
eyes over the piece of bread she was
nibbling.
"No, I live at the mines. I'm a miner.
My stamping-ground's the whole Sier
ra from Siskiyou to Tuolumne."
He looked at her with a queer whim
sical smile. His strong white teeth
gleamed for a moment from between
his bearded lips.
"I'm up at the Sierra a lot of the
time," he continued, "and then I'm
down here a lot of the time. I come
here to find my victims. I locate a
cood prospect in the Sierra, and I come
down here to sell it. That's my busi
ness.**
"Wfcafs your name?" asked Mari
posa suddenly, hearing: herself ask this
last and most pertinent Question with
the dry gllbness of an Interviewer.
"My name? Great Scott, you don't
know It!" be threw back his head and
a. Jolly, sonorous la-urn filled the room.
"That's great, you and I sitting her*
together over supper es If we'd grown
up together in the same nursery, and
you don't know what my name Is. It's
Gamaliel Barron. Do you likÂ© It?"
"Yes." said Mariposa, gravely, "It's a
very nice name."
"I'm glad you think so. I can't say
I'm much attached to the front end of
it. It's a Bible name. I haven't the
least Idea, who the gentleman was. or
what he did. but he's in the Bible
somewhere."
"Saul sat at his feet." said Mariposa;
"he was a great teacher."
"Well, Tm afraid his namesake isn't
much like him. I never taught any
body anything, and certainly no one
ever sat at my feet, and I'd hate It If
they did."
There was another pause, while Bar
ron continued his supper with un
abated gusto. He had finished the cold
meat and was now spreading Jam on
bread and butter and eating it. with
alternate mouthfuls of tea. Though he
ate rapidly, as one accustomed to take
his meals alone, Jie ate like a gentle
man. She found herself regarding him
with a listless curiosity, faintly won
dering what manner of man he was.
Looking up he met her eyes and said:
"You'll be very comfortable here.
Doti't let the first glimpse discourage
you. Elsie's careless, and the boys are
pretty wild, but they're all right when
you come to know them better, and
grandma's fine. There's not many
women in San Francisco to match old
Senora Garcia. She's the true kind."
"What a pity her son died!" said
Mariposa.
He raised his head instantly and an
expression of pain passed over his face.
"You're right, there." he said in a
low voice. "That was one of the hard
est things that ever happened. If
there's a God I'd like to know why he
let it happen. Juan Garcia was the
ealt of the earthâ a great man. He was
the best son, the best husband and the

"You'd better go. And â and â if I said
anything silly, you understand, I
didn't know what I Mas saying. I
meant â that Mr. Shackleton was a
friend of my father's. He's been very
good to me. It gave me an awful
shock. Please go."
Barron set down the pitcher and
went. He was overcome with pity for
the broken creature, and furious with
himself for the shock he had given her.
The words she had uttered had made
little impression on him at first. H was
afterward, while he was in the silence
of his own room, that they recurred to
him with mere significance. For a
space he thought of the remark and her
explanation of It with some wonder.
But before he settled to sleep, he had
pushed the matter from his mind, set
ting It down as the meaningless utter
ance of an hysterical woman.
It had the desired effect. Gasping,
saturated, but dragged back to some
sort of control, by the chill, current
running from her head in rillets over
her body, Mariposa sat up. The man
was standing before her, anxiously re
garding her, the pitcher held ready for
another application. She pushed it
away with an icy hand.
"Friend!" she echoed, almost with a
shriek. "Friend! Why, he was my
father."
The voice ended in a wild, peal of
laughter, horrible, almost maniacal.
The man. paying no attention to her
words, realized that the strain of the
day and her overwhelming depression
of spirits had completely unbalanced
her. Her wild laughter suddenly gave
way to wilder tears. In u moment he
ran to the door to summon the senora.
but in tho> next, remembered that Elsie
and the boys would undoubtedly ac
company her, and that the woman be
fore him was in no state to be exposed
to their uncomprehending stares.
Hysterics were new to him, but he
had a vague idea that water adminis
tered suddenly from a pitcher was the
only authorized cere. He seized tfrb
pitcher from the wa.shstand, began to
sprinkle her somewhat timidly with his
fingers, and finally ended by pouring a
fair amount on her head.
"I'm so awfully sorry; I didn't know
you knew him well. I didn't know he
was a friend."
'Jake Shackleton's dead!"
The tespot fell with a crash on, the
table. Her mc-uth opened, her face
turned an amazing pallor, and she sat
staring at the astonished man with
horror-stricken eyes.
"Dead!" she gasped ; "why every
body's dead!" -
Barron dropped the paper on the
floor.
"Well, then, if you don't mind. I'll

He handed her the cup, already shak

struggling with the leakage of the
broken spout, when he gave a loud
ejaculation:
"Great Scott! here"s*news!"
"What is it?" she queried, the broken
teapot suspended over the cup.
She shook her .head. The paper had
not much interest for her at the best
cf times.
"Oh. look!" he said; "we forget the
paper. You've finished; wouldn't you
like to see it?"\

There was a pause. Harney settled
back in his chair. The room was ex

from Essex's pipe.

The two faces stared at each other.
The drunken man was not' too far be

of what he was saying. In a second's
retrospect Essex's mind flew back over
the hitherto puzzling Interest Shackle

Could it be possible the man before
him was telling 1 the truth?

"She weren't. She married twict,

"There was complications. Have
you ever heard that Shackleton -was
ence a Mormon?"
Essex had heard the gossip which
had persistently followed Shackleton's
ascending course. He nodded his
head, gazing at Harney, a presenti
ment of coming revelations holding
him silent.
"Well, thafa true. He was. I seen
him when he was. Jake Shackleton
crossed the Siorra with two wives.
One â the first one â was the lady who
died here a month ago, and passed as
Mrs. Moreau. The , other's , the
widow. But she was the second, wife.
She didn't have no children then. But

"Where did you see it?"
"In the Sierra back of Hangtown.

and they was the worst looking outfit
you've ever clapped your eyes on.
They was pretty near dead. One er

afterwards was called Mrs. Moreau â

He paused. The other, smoking,
with frowning brows and wide eyes,
made no response, his own thoughts
holding him in tense Immobility.
"And the other wife wouldn't er

His voice broke and trailed oft Into
silence, which was suddenly Interrup
â¢ted by a guttural snort ' and then
heavy, regular breathing. Essex rose,
and, going to the window, opened it.
A keen-edged breeze of air entered,
seeming all the fresher from the dense
atmosphere of the room. Its hurried
entrance sent the)' smoke wreaths
skurrylng about In fantastic whorl3
and curls. The dying fire threw out a
frightened flume.
Essex moved toward it, saying as he
approached:
fr. < "Yes; It's a good story. You ought

Ir There .was *o answer, and, looking
-'into the chair, he saw that Harney

against the chair-back, his chin sunk
on his breast, the hollows in his face
looking black In the hard light of the

for a moment with an expression of

with his beady, dark eyes glistening

leaned forward to deliver the climax
of his story:

and talented daughter In a Jealous and

Shackleton's Interest in the girl. He
even saw now, recalling the two faces,

and chin, which did not belong to the
soft, feminine prettiness of Lucy.
It must be true.
And, being true, what possibilities
might it not develop? Mrs. Shackle

Trumpet, Essex attended the funeral
of his chief. He and Mrs. Willers
and Edna, In company with the young
woman who -did the "Fashions and
Foibles" column, were In one of the
carriages that Murlpusn. hud seen from
tho hilltop. Mrs. Willers was silent on
the long, Â«lovr drive. She had hon
ored her chief, who had been Just to
her. Miss Peebles, the "Fashions and
Foibles" young woman, was so en
grossed by her fears that a change of
ownership lii The Trumpet would rob
her of her employment that she could
talk of nothing else. To Edna, the
sensation of being In a carriage was so
novel It occupied her to the exclusion
of all other matters .and she looked
out of the window with n face of
sparkling interest.
That evening, after the funeral, Es
sex was preparing to work late. He
had "gutted" the pile of books, and
with their contents well assimilated
was ready to write his three columns.
There waa no carllne on the street,
nnd traffic at that hour on that quiet
thoroughfare was over for the d^y.
For. an hour he wrote easily and flu
ently. The sheets, glistening with
damp Ink, were pushed in front of
him In a careless pile. Now and then
he paused to consult his books, which
werÂ« arranged round him on the table,
open at tho place he needed for refer
ence. The smoke wreaths were thick
round his head and thÂ« room was hot.
It was nearly ten o'clock when he
heart! the noisy entrance of "his fellow
lodger. Harney was evidently suffi
ciently well to go to work again and to
corns homa drunk. Essex listened
with suspend^! pen and a half smile
on his dark face, which turned to a
frown as ha realised that the stum
bling feet had turned his way. Tha
knock on the door ctvme next, and
simultaneously It opened and Harney's
head iras thrust In.
"What the devil do you want?" said
the scribe, sitting erect, his pipe in his
hand, the other waving the smoke
strata that hung before his face!
"Let me come and get warm a min
ute. I'm wheezing again, and ray
room's cold as a tomb. Don't mind
me â all I want is to set before the fire
for a spell."
He sidled In before the permission
was granted and sank down In tha
armchair, hitching: It nearer- to the
grate. He was a man to whom intox
ication lent a curiously amiable and
humorous quality. The ugliness and
evil that were so evidently part of his
nature were not so apparent, and he
became cheerful, almost genial.
Sitting close to the fire, he held out
his hands to the blaze, then, stealing a
look at Essex over hia shoulder, saw
that he was refilling his pipe.
"Been to the funeral?" he said.
Essex grunted an assent.
"The family there?"
"None of the ladles; only Win
Shackleton."
Harney was silent; then, with the
greatest care, he took up a piece of
coal and set It on the fire. The action
required all the Ingenuity of which he'
was master. His body responded to
his intoxication, while, save for an un
usual fluency of speech, his mind ap
peared to remain unaffected. After he
had set the coal in place he looked at
Essex, who was staring vncantly at
him, thinking of ihe second part of his
article.
"Did you notice a tall, fine-looking
young lady there with dark red hair?"
said Harney, without removing his
glassy gaze from the man at the table.
Essex did not move his eyes, but
their absent fixity suddenly seemed
to snap into a change of focus betok
ening attention. Gazing at Harney, he
answered coldly:
"No;, I saw no one like that. To
whom are you referring?"
"Oh, I dunno, I dunno," responded
the other with a clumsy shrug of his
shoulder, and turning back to the fire
over which he cowered.
"But you know her anyhow," he
added, half to himself.
"Whom do I know? Turn around."
The man turned, looking a little de
fiant
"Now, what are you trying to say?"
"I ain't trying to say nuthln'. All I
done is to ask yer if yer saw a lady â
tall, with red hair â at the funeral.
You know her, 'cause I've seen you
with her."
"Who is she?"
"Well," slowly and uneasily, "she's
called Moreau."
"You mean Miss Mariposa Moreau,
the daughter of a mining man, who
died last spring in Santa Barbara?"
"Yes; that's her all right. She's
called Moreau, but it ain't her name."
"Moreau isn't her name? What is
her name, then?"
"I dunno," he spoke stubbornly and
turned back to the fire.
"Turn back here." said Essex In a
suddenly authoritative tone; "explain
to me what you mean by that"
VI don't mean nuthln'," said the
other, looking sullenly defiant, "and 1 1
don't know nuthln' only that that ain't
her true name."
"What is her name? Answer me at
once, and no fooling."
"I dunno."
Essex rose. Harney, looking fright
ened, staggered to his feet, clutching
the mantelpiece. He half-raised his
arm as if expecting to be struck and
said loudly:
"If you want to know ask Shackle
ton's widow. She knows."
Essex stood a few paces from him,
suddenly stilled by the phrase. The
drunkard, alarmed and yet defiant,
could only dimly understand what the
expression on the face of the man be
fore him meant.
"Sit down," said 3ssex quietly; "I'm
not going to touch you. I'm going to
get some whisky. That'll tone you up
a bit. The bronchitis has taken It out
of you more than you think."
He went to a cupboard and brought
out a bottle and glasses. Pouring
some whisky Into one, he pushed it to
ward Harnev.
"There, that'll brace you up. You'll
feel more yourself in a minute."
He diluted his own with water and
of reference books he had to consult
for an article on the great actresses
of the French stage from Clairon to
Roche!. These light and brilliant es
says had been an experiment of
Shacklcion's. who maintained that the
Sunday edition should furnish food for
ail types of minds. Essex had pro
duced exactly the class of matter
wanted, and received for It the gen
erous pay that the proprietor of The
Trumpet was always ready to give for
good work.
The reader waa fluttering the leaves
of the first book of the pile when a
knock at the door stopped him. He
knew It was his neighbor across the
hall, who had been in bed for over a
week, yick with bronchitis. Essex had
seen the man several times during his
seclusion and had conceived a care
lessly cynical interest in him.
When sober, he had developed re
markable anecdotal capacity, which
had Immensely amused his new ac
quaintance. Tales of *49 and the early
Comstock days, scandals of those now
in hixh places, discreditable accounts
of the making of fortunes, flowed from

Of his own personal history he was
reticent, merely saying that his name
waa George Harney, and his trade that
of Job-printer. Drink had almost de
stroyed him. Physically he was a
mere bunch of nerves covered by flab
by, sallow flesh.
In answer to Essex's "oonw in." the
door opened and Harney shambled In
to the room. He was fully dressed,
but showed the evldenoes of Illness in
his hollowed cheeks and eyes, and the
jrellow skin hanging flaccid round Jaw
and throat. His hand shook and his
gait was uncertain, but he was per
fectly sober.
"I came to cave a squint at the pa
per. Doc" be said In a hoarse voice.
"I can't go out with this blasted
' wheezing on me. Dont want to die In
i my prime."*
Essex threw the paper across the
table at him.
"There's news to-night," hÂ« said
taking up bis book; "Shaokleton's
dead."
The rrmw stopped as 1* electrified.
"Shackle ton? Jake Shackleton 7"
he said in a loud voice.
"Jake Shackleton." answered Essex,
surprised at the startled astonishment
of his Â£aoo. "Did you know him?"
Harney snatched the paper and
opened It with an unsteady hand. He
ran his eyes over the lines under the
black-lettered heading of the first
page.
"By gosh!" ha said to himself, "so
ha Is; so he Is!"
He sat down In the chair at the op
posite side of the table, smoothed out
the sheet and read the account slowly
and carefully.
"By gosh!" he said again when he
had finished, "who'd a thought
Jake'd go off like that!"
"Did you know him?" repeated Es
sex.
"Once up In the Sierra, when we
was all mining up there."
He spoke absently and sat looking:
into the fire for a moment, then said:
"It's pretty tough luck to be
I whisked off that way when you Just
got everything in the palm of your
hand."
Essex made no reply, and after a
pause he added:
"Between fifteen and twenty mil
lions it says there," Indicating the pa
per, "and when I saw Jake Shackleton
first you wouldn't er hired him to
sweep down the steps of The Trumpet
office. But that was twenty-five
years ago at least."
"Oh, Shackleton was an able man.
There's no question about that They
trere saying in the office to-night that
twenty million is a conservative figure
ro put his money at."
"Who does it go to? Do you know
that?" queried the man by the fire.
"Widow and children, I suppose.
There are two children. Don't
amount to anything. I believe."
"Xo; there are three."
i Harney turned from the fire and
looked over his shoulder. He was sit
ting in a hunched position, his back
rounded, his chin depressed. His
black eyes, that drew close to his
nose, were instinct with eager cunning.
The Ekln across the bridge of the nose
was drawn in wrinkles. As he looked
the wheezing of his disturbed breath
ing was distinctly audible. Essex was
struck by the sly and malevolent In
telligence of his face.
"Three children!" he said. "Well,
I've always heard the death of a bo
nanza king was the signal for a large
crop of widows and orphans to take
the field."
"There won't be any widow this
tizne. She's dead. But the girl's alive
and I've seen her."
He accompanied this remark with a
second look, significant with the same
malicious Intensity Â«f meaning. Then
he rose to his feet and walked to
ward the door.
"Good-night. Doc." ha said as he
reached it; "ain't well enough to talk
to-night."
Eesex gave him a return good-night
and the door closed on him. The
younger man cogitated over his books
for a space. It did not strike him as
Interesting or remarkable that Shack
leton should have had an unacknowl
edged child, of whose existence George
Harney, the drunken Job-printer,
knew. He was becoming accustomed
to the extraordinary intermingling of
classes and conditions that marked
the pioneer period of California life.
But should the unacknowledged child
attempt to establish its claim, to part
cf the great estate left by* the bonanza
king, what a complication that might
lead to! These Calif ornians were cer
tainly a picturesque people, with their
dramatic ups and downs of fortune,
their disdain of accepted standards,
their Indifference to t-aditlon, and
their magnificently disreputable pasts.

When she was fully decided as to
the wisdom of her course, she wrote?
Marfposa a short but friendly lett?r..
speaking of her knowledge of Mr.
Shackleton's plans for her advance
ment, of her desire to carry out her
late husband's wishes, and naming a
day and hour at which she begged the
young girl t& call on her. It was a
simple matter to ascertain Mis3
Moreau'g address from Mrs. Willers.
and the letter was duly sent.
It ro'used wrath in its recipient.
Mnrlposa was learning worldly wis
dom at a rate of which her tardy de
velopment had not given promise.
Great changes were taking place in
her simple nature. She had been
wakened to life with 1 savage abrupt
ness. Dormant characteristics, pas
sions unsuspected, had risen to the
surface. The powerful feelings of a
rich but undeveloped womanhood had
suddenly been shaken from their
sleep by a grip of the hand of destiny.
The unfamlliarity of a bitter anger
against the Shackletons struggled with
the creeping disgust of Essex, that
grew dally.
Morning after morning she woka
when the first gray light was faintly
defining: the squares of the windows.
The leaden sense of wretchedness
that seemed to draw her out of sleep
gave place to the living hatred and
shame that the upheaval of her life
had left behind. She watched the
golden wheat-ears dimly glimmering
on the pale walls, while she lay and
thought of all she had learned of life,
her faith and happy Ignorance de
stroyed forever.
Six weeks ago Mrs. Shackleton's let
ter would have represented no more to
her than what its words expressed.
Now, she saw Bessie's anxiety to be
rid of her, to push her out of sight as
a menace. How much more readily
would the widow have' gone to work, t
with what zest of alarm and energy/
would she have contrived for her ex-*
pulslon, had she guessed what Marl
posa knew. The girl vacillated for a
day. hating the thought of an inter
view with any member of the family
Â¦whose wrongs to her beloved mother
were seared scars in her brain; but
finally concluding that It would be
better to end her connection with
them by an interview with Mrs.
Shackleton, she answered the letter,
statins that she would coma at the
appointed hour. /
Two days later, at the time set In \
the afternoon, she. stood In the small
reception-room, to the left of the wide
marble hall, waiting. The hushed
splendor of the house 'would have Im
pressed and awed her at any other
time. But to-day her heart beat loud
and her brain was preoccupied with
Its effort to keep her purpose clear,
and yet not, to be angered into reveal- j
Ing too much. y
which Bessie had suffered In finding
her husband dead had rendered the
country place unbearable to her.
The day after the funeral the
women had removed to town. Win.
however, remained at Menlo Park, to
tfb over such documents of hl3 father's
rs had been left there. Shackleton
had lived so much at his country
place for the last two or three years
that many of his papers and letters
were kept in the library, which had
been his special sanctum.
"Among these, the son had come up
on a small. package of letters, which,
fastened together with an elastic.' and
bearing a note of their contents on
one end, had roused his Interest. They
were the letters exchanged between
hia father and the chief of the detec
tive bureau when the latter had been
commissioned to locate the widow nnd
daughter of Daniel Moreau.
Shackleton; a man of exceedingly
methodical habits, had kept copies of
his letters. There were only seven of
them altogether â three from him:
four In reply. The first onrs were
short, only a few lines, containing the
request to find the ladles who, the
writer understood, were In San Fran
cisco, and ascertain their circum
stances nnd position. Then came the
acknowledgment of that, and then
in a few days, the answer stating the
whereabouts of Mrs. Moreau and her
daughter, their means, and such
small facts about them as that . tho
mother was In delicate health and the
daughter "a handsome, accomplished,
and estimable young lady."
Win looked over this correspond
ence, puzzled and wondering. He re
membered the girl he had seen In
The Trumpet office that dark after
noon, and how the office boy had told
him it was a Miss Moreau, a friend of
Miss Willers and a singer. What mo
tive could his father have had in seek
ing out this girl and her mother in
this secret and effectual way? He
read over the letters again. Moreau
had died In Santa Barbara in the
spring, the widow and her daughter
had then come to San Francisco, and
by the wording of the second letter ho
Inferred that his father had been Ig
norant of their means, and of the
girl's appearance, style and character.
It was evidently not the result of an
interest in people he had once known
and then lost sight of. It seemed to
be an Interest, for some outside rea
son, in two women of whom he knew
absolutely nothing.
Win had heard that his father con
templated offering: a musical educa
tion to some singing girl, of whom the
young man knew nothing, and had
seen only for a moment that day in
The Trumpet office. This was un
doubtedly the girl. But Shackleton
evidently had not heard of her
through Mrs. Willers, who was known
to be an energetic* boomer of obscure
genlua. He had hunted her out him
self; had undoubtedly had some ulte
rior. Interest in, or knowledge of her
some time before the day Win had
seen her. It was odd, the boy thought,
meditating over the correspondence.
What could have led his father to
search for, and then attempt to assist
a woman who seemed to be a com
plete stranger to him? It looked like
the secret paying of an old debt.
Win put the letters In his pocket
and went up to town. There was
more work for him to do now than
there had been before, and he rose to
it with a spirit -d energy that sur
prised himself. Neither he nor any
one else had ever realized how para
lyzing to him had been his father's
cold scorn. From boyhood. Win had
felt himself to be an aggravating
failure. The elder man had not scru
pled to make him understand his in
feriority. The mere presence of his
father seemed to numb his brain and
make his tongue stammer over the
simplest phrases. Now, he felt him
self free and full of energy, as though
bands that had cramped his mind and
confined his body were broken. His
old attitude of posing as a fast young
man of fashion lost its charms. Life
grew suddenly to mean something, to
be full of use and purpose.
He was left very much to himself,
his mother being still too much broken
to attend to business, and Maud being
absorbed in her affair with Latimer,
which had recently culminated in a
secret engagement. This she had been
afraid to tell to her domineering
father and ambitious mother, and her
opportunities of seeing her fiance had
been of the briefest until now. Lati
mer haunted the house of evenings,
when Bessie was lying on the sofa in
an upstairs boudoir and Win was
locked in his father's study going over
the interminable documents.
The first darkness of her grief and
horror past, Bessie, in her seclusion,
thought of many things. One of these
Â¦was the fate of Marlposa Moreau. The
bonanza king's widow, with all her
faults, bad that lavish and reckless
generosity, where money was con
cerned, that marked the early Callfor
nlans. This forceful woman, who had
made the blighting Journey across the
plains without complaint, faced the
fierce hardships of her early married
life with a smile, borne her children
amid the rude discomforts of, remote
mining camps, was an adept in the art
of luxurious living. She knew by In
stinct how to be magnificent, and one
of her magnificences waa the careless
munificence of her generosity.
Now, she felt for Mariposa. She
knew Shackleton's plans for her, and
realized the girl's disappointment In
her heart she had been bitterly Jeal
ous of the other wife's child, who had
the beauty and gifts her own lacked.
It would be to everybody's advantage
to remove the girl to another country
and sphere. And because her hus
band had died there was no reason
why his plans should remain unful
filled. Though Shackleton had as
sured her that the girl knew nothing,
though every one connected with the
shameful bargain but , herself was
dead, it was best to be prudent, espe
cially when prudence was the course
most agreeable to all concerned. She

with some trunks and boxes. It was
a quaint, antique affair of mahogany,
severely colonial in style. The main

on hand-carved lega. There were four
drawers, two on each side, and a
small, low cabinet of pigeon-holes on
top. '
Suzanne stood motionless before it

up her mind to insert the key. "When
she did so. in tjie lock of the nearest
top drawer, her hand trembled slight

turned easily and the drawer was
ready for inspection, but she did not

other. Half way there was a turn at

night bells rang out she might be
making a few strange resolutions for
the cominc year.
It was dark on the irarret stairs.
She stopped at the door of Bob's dress

the mantel. It was a wedding gift â a
Japanese bronze griffin, with outspread
wings and spiral, sinuoua tall.
Aa Â»ho held . it to the gas jet to

rug at her feet and she picked it up.
It was a small, old-fashioned ordinary
brass key. She looked at it hesitat

the wings of the bronze griffin was a
clever idea for concealment.

was what Florence Maude was look

manager would 'Â¦'Â¦, once \ give her . a
chance to tell him about the last will
and testament of the soldier, who lay
Being naturally a kind-hearted girl,
Florence Maude didn't want to keep
the poor manager waiting for her. She
didn't know that a theatrical man
ager's principal occupation is
waiting for :. good actresses to
come along; moat of them are
still waiting. The first office
that ehe floated into was presided over
by a small bc-y with a Zangwlll cast of
features and a desire to oblige that
would have made a street car conduc
tor look like the original Lord Chester
field. This accommodating young gen
tleman assured Florence Maude that
the manager had been called suddenly
to Albany to fight a bill In the Legisla
ture making a working knowledge of
the English language indispensable for
singers in comic opera.. H.e also In
formed her that budding actresses were
so thick In New York that winter that
business traffic had been ordered off
Broadway from Twenty-sixth street to
the Hotel Metropole. :
Florence Maude's ambition was
pulling back on the leading strap as
she dragged it out into the street
again. The automobile and the mid
night, suppers didn't seem so immi
nent as they had the night before, but
she still had hope." The rest of that
day and of several days might havu
been represented by ditto marka as
far as Florence Maude wÂ«i_s concerned.
T>ere seemed to be an overproduction
of expert actresses and an underpro
duction of acceptable places.
had been practicing: on her smile for
a year and she was sure that she could
bring down the toughest manager *on
the Rialto.
With a heart full of emotion and
reviving ambition she was ushered
Into the presence of the manager with
her smile trained to the minute and her
voice ready to break out at a moment's
warning. She intended to explain to
the man that she was going Into the
chorus only as a temporary relief
measure, and that her real forte was
the tremolo variety of drama where the
heroine comes on in the first act with
her hair hanging down her back, and
demands that the villain produce her
che-ild forthwith or tell her the name
of his lawyer.
She would undoubtedly have made a
great hit with the manager if he had
given her the chance to tell him about
it, but instead of asking her to rpeak
a few pieces for him he looked her
over as though he was thinking about
buying her a couple of new gowns and
wanted to get something that would
lit her complexion and general make
up. He didn't even want to know if
she could sing, which was very care
less of him; if she had happened to
be able to warble a few notes in tune
the effect on the rest of the chorus Is
awful to contemplate. . The upshot of
the brief interview was that Florence
Maude was told to appear for rehearsal
the next morning and afternoon and
to be at the theater promptly at 7
o'clock, or be set back $2. For this
arduous service at the shrine of the
late Melpomene she was to receive the
tremendous stipend of $3 a week, with
the possibility of a raise to nine before
the end of the season, if the show
didn't fade away or the treasurer de
part suddenly to keep an important en
gagement in Montreal.
She stood it for about two weeks and
then drew the $6 73 standing to her
credit, over and above the fines levied
for being late at rehearsals, having a
hole in her slipper, falling on her face
in the middle of the last act and-com
mitting other offenses against the dra
matic proprieties. Then she took the
back track for Hopkinsville and broke
the news to her loving friends that the
American stage was in a bad way, and
that genius was the last thing wanted
In the back row. of the chorus. Six
months later she married the dentist,
and Is now the leading light of the
Hopkinsville Hawthorne Club.
The only trouble with Florence Maude>
was that she hadn't discovered that
the only thing which is .begun at the
top is a hole .in the ground. Most of
the;peopla rwho-are engaged In con
structing those are doing it for : the
purpose of crawling Into them after
ward.
dying in Algiers he would turn the
manicurist out into the cold, cold
world and give her a whack at the
Prince.
As was only natural under the cir
cumstances Florence Maude soon be
gan to have visions of herself pushing
the boucjuets out of her way and glid
ing swiftly between solid rows of the
most approved style of Johnnies to
the stage door, where her automobile
lay in waiting.
She had heard great tales of the sala
ries that leading ladies received for do-
Ing perfectly simple things, as much as
a hundred dollars a week for walking
about on a stage and talking In a nat
ural tone of voice, without a
single thrill in it, for two or
three hours every night When
they were not doing this they
were giving delightful littla suppers.
At last Florence Maude reached the
point where she could no longer re
strain her vaulting ambition. She
must act or she must perish. She was
dead sure that tho world was standing
on tiptoe for her to come out and show
just how It should be done. Accord
ingly she packed her child's, size Sara
toga and took tha nine-forty accommo
dation from Hopklnsville to Jones Cen
ter, where she was to connect with the
Accidental Limited. Her cry was, "On
to Gotham!" That's a pretty good kind
of a cry, but people who have tried it
have found Gotham a mighty hard
kind of a place to get on to.
After Florence Maude had estab
lished herself in a boarding-house,
where she wouldn't be set back more
than twenty-five per, at the outside,
phe started out on the still hunt for
the deadly manager in hl3 lair.
She had written to two or three that
she was coming, but they hadn't even
answered her letters. Probably they
were too busy looking for a play for
her. Her idea of the way that she
would break Into the theatrical world
was modeled largely on a' story that
she had read about a young woman
from Manayunk, who got her picture
into the shop windows the first month
out, married a member of the Stock
Exchange inside of a year, was di
vorced in six months and was now
drawing a hundred and â¢ fifty per
(haps). All that this young lady # had
done was to walk into the office and
smile at the manager. Florence Maude

face the world with a clean slate. I
shall have a taste of earning my daily
bread."
"You don't mean" â sha began In
amazement.
"That's just what I do mean," he
6aid. "Those Western failures have
wiped me clean off the map. I haven't
a cent in the world, and consequently
I can't afford to stay any longer, at
an expensive place like this."
The girl clasped her little hands to
gethtr and knit her brows. She seemed
trying to grasp the full import of his
words.
"It's awful!" she exclaimed.
"Isn't it?" he said dryly.
"Ar.d you're going home to-morrow?"
ehe imkzd.
"Home?" He laughed recklessly.
"My clear child, why on earth should
I go home? There's absolutely noth
ing there for me. Even worse: there
are a hundred and one men who have
been waiting fcrr the chance to jump
on me when I'm down. Home? Well.
I should rather say not. Bcntley has
offered me a job on his rubber reserve
In Scntii America, I'm going there to
morrow."
The girl looked at hfs face turned to
hers in the moonlight. It was a strong,
determined face â the face of a man
who as'iv* odds of no one. She felt a

immobility. In a moment the chauffeur
was off his seat, and poking about In
the machinery. Then he went to tha
door of the carriage and touched hia
hat.
"Beg pardon, miss," he said, "but
she's broke down an'll have to go to
the shop. I'm sorry, but you'll have
to get around the city some other way."
The girl on the back seat â a tall,
handsome blonde with the bluest of
blue eyesâ uttered an exclamation. "If
that Isn't too bad! And. I'va got Just
two hours to" see Washington before
my train goes! Can't you call another
auto for me?" .Vi.%
The chauffeur glanced around him*.
"Oh, yes'm," he said. "Of course.
There ought â¢- be some here on the
stand now, only there ain't. But I'll
go In an* telephone for one right away."
_"Do! Or stay, there's one waiting
at the postoffice door now. Maybe it's
for hire."
The man looked doubtfully at the
machine indicated. "Don't think so,
miss," he answered. "That's a private
machine or I miss my guess; still, I'll
ask." Leaving the girl he walked over
to the curb and addressed the young
man sitting on the box of a handsome
automobile.
No one familiar with the new horse
less vehicles would for one moment
have supposed that the one in question
was for hire. "Racer" appeared in ev
ery line of its build and costliness in
the exquisite nicety of its construction.
Â¦ That anything but an instant nega
tive would be the answer to his query
"whether that machine was for hire?"
had never passed his brain, so his as
tonishment may be guessed when the
young man on the box started, glanced
at the girl still sitting in the Injured'
vehicle a short distance away, flushed
deeply, and replied In the affirmative.
Then, without waitlnc for further ex
planation, he promptly ran his machine
to the side of the other, and halted to
permit the girl to climb in. The next
moment they were swinging down the
avenue at a lively gait.
The girl leaned forward. "Ahem!"
she said. "Did the other man tell you
where I wanted to go?"
"Said you wanted to eee ths city,
ma'am." returned the young man, re
epectfully, but in a curiously muffled
tone. He had kept his head averted,
almost as if he wished to conceal hia
featuresâ a wishâ If it were a wish-
In which he had been successful; the
girl had looked at the machine but
not at the driver.
When the chauffeur spoke she
started and glanced curiously at him,
as though his voice struck some cor
mant chord In her memory. "Yes," she
said. "I do want to see the city, but
I want to get to the depot by 3 o'clock.
My train goes out then."
"Yes'm. I'll get you there In, time.
Going East, ma'am?"
"Will you tell me why I must?" ha
said, watching it flash in the dim light.
"Toâ to pay my passage down the're
with you, Tod," she said with burning
checks.
"Do you think I am that sort?" she
asked hotly. "Do you think I prom
ised to marry you to desert you at a
time like this?"
"I know," he argued, "that is very
noble of you. But remember what
this meansâ years and years of wait
ing, probably. A man can lose in a
day what It takes a lifetime to replace
â what can sometimes never be re
placed. I can't subject you to such
conditions. You are young and the
doors of the world are open to you.
It may be hard now, but you'll forget
me presently. It Is better that you
should."
"Tod!" There was a world of re
proach In her voice.
"Better give it back to me," he ad
vised.
She covered her face with her hands
and began to sob. He watched her
with all a man's helplessness at such
a moment.
"Iâ I thought you cared more than
that," she said chokingly.
"Cared?" he eald wildly, "cared?
Good God! Have you any idea how
much I care? Let me tell you, then.
I have cared so much I have stayed
here until I am well nigh penniless.
Come what might, I was bound to be
with you until the last cent was gone.
I have stayed until there is nothing
leftâ until It becomes necessary for me
to go over to the town to-morrow to
pawn my evening clothes and watch to
get my passage money down there. I
have cared like the desperate gambler
who plays the game to his last farth
ing. That's the way I care," he ended
hoarsely.
The man and girl faced each other
In silence; he with tense, drawn face;
she with a wonderful light in her eyes.
She drew the ring from her finger and
laid it in his big. brown hand. .
"You are wise," he said heartily^
She looked at him searchihgly.
"I give it back on one condition," she
said.
"And that?"
"You must pawn it."
"Pawn it?" he gasped. "Not this. I
can't"
"You must," she said.
"I wanted you to know all these
things before I went," said he, "and
I wanted to tell you some other things.
That is why I brought you out here
where it is quiet First, will you
kindly slip off that ring and give it
to me?" â¢
He threw his cigar Into the water
and watched it float lazily away on
the tide.
Perhaps not," she admit
"Is it imprudent for a man who is
going to a perdition of a wilderness to
drain his cup of happiness to the last
dregs before he leaves?" said he.
"And yet you have stayed on here
for two weeks." t-he said accusingly.
"I have stayed as lgng as the money
I had with me â ail the money I had
in the world, for that matter â lasted,"
he said.
"Wasn't that rather imprudent?"
she asked.
He had sprung from the seat and
stood holding out h!s hands*. thÂ» light
of love pleading in hia eyes. "Won't
you go in with me, Bessie?" he asked
again. â¢
For an instant the. girl hesitated:
then she took the proffered hand.
"Yes. Frank," she said softly. "I will
go with you â now and always"
"Bless that old gasoline rattletrap
that broke down with you," he cried.
"It must have been one of Cupid's up
to-date chariots in disguise."
"Of course! The minute I really
looked at you. But you'll make me
miss my train."
"Train? No train for you! I'll not
take any chances now. Your interest
In the city may have lapsed, but here's
the City Hall. Shall I go in and get
a marriage license, or â will you go in
Â¦with me?"
"That? Oh, the Patent office or
the Pension Office or something!
Think of â "
"But suppose the girl has sent him
away?"
"Then let her whistle him back and
see whether he won't come."
The girl glanced at the broad back
of the man before her, while her
shoulders quivered with silent mirth.
Then she puckered up her lips and
deliberately emitted a clear, soft
whistle.
The effect was magical. Instantly
the chauffeur swung around in his
seat and faced her. "Bessie!" he ex
claimed, "do you mean It?"
The girl smiled at him, though her
eyes were dewy. "Of course I do,
Frank," she said. "I never thought
you would go away as you did ju3t
for a word. No! No! Keep your
seat. You can say all that's really
necessary from where you are."
"And you knew me all the time?"
"Married! Whew! That's a very
radical remedy. It might be worse
than the other trouble. How many
books are there in the library?"
"Two or three million, I believe.
Oh, no! You wouldn't find it so. I'm
sure. Think of crowing Into a spec
tacled old maid! All college girls do,
you know. Then think of that young
fellow just longing to make a home
for you â "
"What bulldlne Is that?"
"Yes. Why, of course, most girls
have â have â can marry." Tha man
was speaking eagerly now, but ha still
kept his face turned away and threw
the words over his shoulder.
"Oh, a stepmother at home, for In
stance. How many Senators are there?"
"Three hundred and eight-six, I be
lieve. A stepmother might be a terror
to some girls, of coarse, but most of
them can get away from one home to
another without coins to college."
"How? By tha way, is that tha li
brary?"
Again the girl looked at Mm curi
ously. "Yes." Bhe answered slowly,
"I'm on my way to college."
"Ohâ erâ you believe In tha higher
education of women, then."
The girl's eyes were dancing with fun
now. "Under certain circumstances,"
ahe said. "Is that the Capitol?"
"Yes'm, that's the CapltoL Under
certain circumstances. What circum
stances, for Instance?"

ings. If ycu meant that sort of thing.
"Why, Bess," she turned to the ques
tioner with sudden energy, "I wouldn't
have thought a thing about it if he
had shown It to me, or even mentioned
It. He told me about everything else
In the house, and I'd never have known
a thing about this If I hadn't told
Nora to clean out that 'catch all,' as
ehe calls It, at the turn of the parrot
stairs. There is a large, wlndowless
epace over the dining-room wing, and
It was In there."
"And locked," concluded Bess, posi
tively.
"Every drawer. I asked Nora how
lore It hud been there, and she said
It had come with Bob's trunks from
home, while we were on our honey
moon. I'm not a bit curious" â she
paused.
"Of course not," assented Bess warm
ly; "or suspicious."
"Only interested."
Bess nodded her head wisely over the
intererted sigh.
Bess' words and arguments van
pwiftly through her mind. Come to
think. Bob had told her not to tire her
pelf by rummaging while he was- away.
Rummaging: That meant hunting in
the garret and running the risk of dis
covering the desk.
And Bess had spoken of Adelaide
Gifford. There had been talk of a
Fumtner engagement, she remembered.
Adelaide was older than Bob. Some
way she had always blame-.! her for
the romance and had looked upon
Bob as an impressionable youngster.
But If he had cherished her letters
and keepsakes then ho must have
loved her. Adelaide wa3 engaged to
old Mr. Thurstori now â Copp? 1 * Thurs
ton, the boys called him. Perhaps,
after all. Bob had been jealous of the
copper-made millions and had married
her in a fit of pique.
She turned from the window with
sudden determint'tion. It lacked half
an hour of dinner time. A lonely din-
I>ef=s laughed.
"Good-by. sis. Believe in Bob all you
want to. He's a dear, and if it were I,
I'd hunt a locksmith, all the Fame."
'Irs. Sheldon stood at the window
end watched the small, girlish figure
as it vanished down the street among
the fluttering snou'llake.<=. It was dusk.
The room was unllghted as yet and a
sudden sense of loneliness stole over
her in the semi-gloom, the first she
tÂ£><\ experienced since the joyous wed
ding of a. month ago. If the affinity of
moods and colors were true, she wa3 in
harmony with the soft velvet gray of
the twilight tone that was stealing over
thf world.
Xew Year's eve and Bob away. The
tears blinded her eyes. Of course it
was business, merely a flying trip to
New York for the firm, made art the
more imperative by his neglect of busi
ness during'the honeymoon, but she felt
a vague rebellion in her heart against
even the separation of a few days.
And there was the locked desk.
"Of course, you'll do as ycu please,
Sue. You always did. But if I had
only been married a month and had
found a k-?ked desk in my house that I
knew nothing of, I know what I'd do."
Young Mrs. Sheldon left the piano
with an impatient movement. She was
tall and slender beside her sister, and
the indefinable charm of a bride was
visible in her dainty negligee toilette
of w hite crepon.
"I believevobsolutely in Bob," she de
clared.
Bess raised her eyebrows and smiled
mischievously.
"Of course you do. It may be only
some old love letters or souvenirs that
he doesn't care to part with. Do you

city life and living "next to nature."
So he put his modified Rousseaiiism
into actual practice by going to live in
a modest little home on Long Island,
raising his own ' vegetables, dredging
his oysters from the Sound and trusting
to nature,' like the fowls of the air and
the beasts of the field. Â¦ Such a success
did be make of It that he published a
tensive study of character "The

by the photographic frontispiece to be

to rush into print with a novel â called
so under protestâ entitled "Ignorance

to that of Joan of Arc's as the preface
declares. "Night after night I have

J^AMLIN GARLAND, the first and perhaps the strongest of the new school of fiction writ
ers of the West, is an ardent lover of the mountains, as any of his readers may know.
Since he has associated himself with the West in his life as well as his, books his chief man
ner of recreation from the ardors of writing is to take his pack horse and hie himself to the
snowy fastness of the Rockies. This is a "rare combination of business and pleasure, for the
free air of the mountains, their vastness and the indefinable majesty of their presence all come
to him thus at the first hand and consequently the reflection of ihese influences in a book is an

in Japan. He says:
"Up to 1895 novel-writing was not
looked upon as a respectable profession.
The public would not permit it to be
called gentleman's work. It was re
garded as an unpardonable diversion
of unworthy prodigies. ' The authors
were accused of 'being a demoralizing

with them, since they Indulged, often
provokingly, In the depiction of the

their favorite heroine. I am told that
Ogal Mori was of ten warned by his

Is no place like the Japanese army,
where even an ill-fitting dignity is
necessary. Once for some years Ogal
stopped writing, seeing himself In dan

happen to-day when the Invasion of

to the '"fine art and remarkable talents"

seems "unable to produce editors who
can gather the best illustrators Into a

scribes a series of pilgrimages to all
the noteworthy literary landmarks of
the New England States, dealing with
the work of each author in association
with its background or environment.
This method makes his book both a
guide for the pilgrim and an Illuminat

of Seven Stars," which was reviewed in
these columns last week. Is not in ap
pearance the popular conception of the
"literary man." He Is both large and
ruddy, and his looks do not belle his
reputation as an athlete; for Mr. Stoker
was once athletic champion of the Uni

his education. Unlike some students,
his interest In university life was not
monopolized by athletics. He was also
president of the Philosophical Society

Professor Edward A. Steiner, who
spent much of last year with Count
Tolstoy on his estate at Yasnaya Poly

which is to bear the Imprint of the Out

of non-resistance to evil followed eo
consistently by Tolstoy, he says:
"It is providential that Tolstoy "had
the power of fame and the harmless
ness of the non-resistant, for these two
facts have saved him from the exile
into which have been sent countless
numbers who have provoked the au
thorities far less than has he. He lives
in open enmity against the Govern
ment, whose power over him he does
not acknowledge, whose corruption,
cruelty and hypocrisy he has exposed
over and over again, and whose abso
lutism he is undermining more than
any other person in Russia. Whether
he wished to or not, he became the
scul of all the opposition, and the dis
satisfied of every class have gathered
around his banner, whose reasoning
they do not and care not to under
stand. He became without doubt the
strongest man In Russia, in spite of hij
defenseless conditionâ stronger than
the Czar, who lives in daily terror for
his life; stronger than the officials,
who, in spite of Cossacks and their
whips, are making the country ripe for

hand of ihe Lord, snd led out Into the

contains in its ponjrous numbers ths
impress-ive note of tremendous
slre-njcth. it is o:Â»en to doubt whether
the best v.ritten of novels could be
adequate conveyance enough for the
spirit of this reiaai-kabiy dramatic in
cident in the world's history. Hat to
the credit of Oixaheth Miller b? it said
that her book catches the epic signifi
cance of the hegira with as forceful
a grin as any work of fiction could, and
that the exalted strain of her narrative
comes well nish up lo the trapic sub
limity demanded by the nature of the
subject.
From tho very nature of its being
th? i:?:odus presents to the author who
would handle it difliculties frauprht with
peril to the success of the novel. These
lie in the facts of the plagues sent by
God to break the will of the Pharaoh.
The iiible. couched as it is in the meta
phorical diction of the Oriental, pre
sents these as actual physical phe
nomena, the direct manifestations of
the Most Highâ miracks in short. The
spirit of higher criticism has sought
to associate these chronicled prodigies
with possible normal actions of nature,
tach as would have seemed timely in
terventions of the Divine "vVlll to the
eyes of the hosts ot Israel. What is
the novelist to doâ incorporate the
miracle with its prodigious contradic
tion against nature as she is normally,
or attempt to reconcile the Pentateuch
with th<? modern science of physics?
The author of "The Yoke" boldly
makes the Nile turn into a foamins
river of blood and allows the first
born of ErO'Pt to Â»>o slain even unto
the first-born in Pharaoh's palace.
The story centers about the love of
Kenkcncs, a young Egyptian nobleman,
and a sculptor in the court of Pharaoh,
lor Rachel, a beautiful Israelite slave in
the quarry pits of Masaarah. Kenkones,
with an artistic instinct far in advance
of his times, wishes to break away
from the grotesque ritualistic sculpture
of Egypt and carve out his own concep
tion of the human form as it really ex
ists. While doing this secretly he uses
Rachel for his model, his affection for
her growing with every beautiful line
Â¦which appears out of the rough stone.
She. with her strong Judaic faith in
Cod and loathing for idolators. spurns
his affection at first, until tbe base op
pression of a courtier ot Pharaoh forces
her to seek the protection of the young
Egyptian. N -
The scene shifts to the regal cities of
Thebes and Memphis, where Meneptah,
the Pharaoh, and his courtlere are be-,
ginning to lie disturbed by reports of
risings among the Israelites under the
leadership of the Prince Mesa (Moses).
Very skil'fully the author throws over
the whole court the nameless dread and
uncertainty caused by the terrible
warnings of this Mesu, all the while
keeping the great lawgiver in the back
ground. Follow the plugues, each with
its terrible phenomena graphically de

In its entirety "The Yoke" is a pow
ei-ful story. Despite the fact that Its
length is considerably beyond the usual
limits of the novel of to-day, the move
ment in it rarely slackens. The inci
dents of the various plagues, power
fully pictured, and the final passage
over Egypt of the angel of death make
a climax of remarkable strength. The
vivid descriptions of palace life and
quarry pit which fill the book, though
they may not be as correct as those of
the Egyptologist and novelist, CJeorg
Ebers. are nevertheless effective. The
author's picture of the water carnival

nevertheless, a genuine example of thÂ»

truth there may be two opinions;
doubtless there are those who will hold
that it presents an overdrawn picture

of life are prominent the lesson to be

that it Is the test of actual reading will

of the South Itself toward criticism.
The South very naturally resents be
ing openly treated as the "sick man of

srronia, lynchitis and feudism. Much
wisdom is wasted on the South be
cause this wisdom lacks understanding
and arouses only hostility. That the
fault does not lie with the South is
clearly demonstrated by the spirit of
appreciation and responsiveness with
which the press of every Southern city
is greeting "The Widow in the South"

also gives credit where credit la due.
and does both with a tact and judg

the North that its duty is merely to

GLIMPSES AT CURRENT LITERATUREtween realities and mere fancies, of
the mind are not clearly perceived.
Very few adults can tell the exact
truth about any accident they see.
Nearly every person sometimes stops
and hesitates before he is sure whether
he really had a certain experience, or
whether it is merely a. dream. Have
we not all sometimes asked ourselves
the question, "Did I dream this, or did
I read It, or did some one tell me of It
several years ago?." Remembering 13
simply bringing into our minds images
of what has been there before. It .is
merely another form of imagination.
How easy it Is for any one, especially
a child, to fall to distinguish between
the . image now in the mind- and one
which has been prominent in the mind
some time in the. past! -How, natural
for a chili! thinking; of a runaway, to
confuse the Image now. In the mind
with the one that might have been in
the mind some time ago. If he does,
he would say that he saw a runaway
and tell all the details he - remembers
from the picture in. his mind. He
would then be telling. what, he thought
would be the truth, . even though it
was a falsehood.
Sad to relate,- many parents make It
very hard for their, children to be truth
ful. How often they, promise,, but do
not fulfill, their promises. The worst of
it is, many; times they have no, idea of
fulfilling their; promises. Sometimes a
parent .will, in the presence of children,
welcome most cordially; some.unexpect
ed and undeslred caller. It has been re
ported that, after the doors are closed,
please the parent. Is there a parent
who does not remember such . In
stances? Is not such desire praisewor
thy? Such a child does not reason^
deeply. He does not analyze.. lie can
not. . : . a
Sometimes the parent will playfully
say to a child, "I am a big bear and I
am going to eat 'you,", and many such
expressions. This* ,1s all right. It "la
not wrong. The child knows that he is
just playing. Yet 'the images in the
child's mind will be so rear that the
child will run in great fear.. It Is, In
deed, very hard . for .any child with a
vivid imagination vto readjly distin
guish between Images. Need we won
der that they draw on their Imagina
tions when talking to others?
.. Even Parent* : Make Mistakes.
When we consider that the mental
faculties of children are all very imma
ture, that . their .minds ' ar<â¢ .occupied
with such a multitude of various kinds
of sensations qs to form a bewildering
maze, need, we wonder that children
are ant to handle the truth rather
carelessly? Are there not the best of
reasons to justify our being amazed
that so frequently they are able to
distinguish go well between the Images
of the true and those of the false,
â¢when we ourselves can scarcely under
stand how.'we are able to do so?
Other Reasons â¢ Untruthf ulness.
As children groi,v older the power to
distinguish between images of the
present and 'the past should become
stronger. " It is therefore necessary to
look for other explanations of aeem'-j
untruthf ulness. Do not\parents and
others tell children fairy stories for
the sake of pleasing them? .They do
not expect children to believe them, so
that in one sense they are not untruth
ful.. Now. suppose a child . is asked
whether he was kind' to his little sis
ter. He may answer that he was, -not
so much because of fear ;.-. of conse
quences as because he dislikes to dis-
Don't imagine that children rtaturally
tell the truth. They must be trained
to do so, as they would be trained in
any other desirable habit. Parents
should not expect them to be trained
all manner of unkind things are said
In the hearing of the children.' How
often is this the case? What a terrible
example for children! One little gfrl, on
being told to go to bed as soon as some
callers left, said, "O, please let me stay
up, I want to hear what you say about
them!" Many times children perceive
that parents are deliberately lying
about something. Other times, at least,
it Is ..said parents tell the children to
inform unwelcome â¢ visitors that they
have gone down the street or are not at
home. Sometimes the parent will, de
liberately, and with the knowledge of
the children, conceal things from the
other .parent, and not hesitate to tell
untruths concerning the matter. Some
cases are even worse than the above
mentioned, but these are bad enough.
Under such circumstances Is It any
wonder that children have little Idea
of the importance of tellingf the truth?
NÂ«ed we be surprised, that under such
training, children soon learn to deceive
even more successfully than their par-

Finally, let the parent be sure that
they not only encourage their children

by harsh knocks, which so often result.
The parent should not feel too much
worried if a young child Is continually
telling stories. The fehaedy lies In pro
per training.
If a child shows great fear of the
consequences, the parent should care
fully consider whether the consequen
ces have not been too severe In the
past. Is it not true that very often,
children are driven into "telling . un
truths by the mistakes which the par
ents "have made in punishins false
hoods?
The young child who tflla'an un
truth should not be punished severely,
if at all. What such a child needs is
the right kind of instruction: not.pun
istiment. in anger. He should- have an
explanation of the evils resulting
from a continuance of such practices.
if he 13 not too young. When a child
does tell the truth, under trying cir
cumstances, too much approval cannot
be given. By stories concerning truth
ful children and in various other ways,
no effort should be spared to train
children so that they will get in the
habit of telling the truth.
Upon firet thought, it seems that we
have 1. right to expect the truth from
cveo' person at all times and especially
from children. But is it such an easy
matter to tell the truth? Is there any
good reason why we shonld feel shock
ed v.hers a young child tells a false
hood? What do r.e mean when we say
a chi'd ought to tell the truth? T>o we
not mean that it is the child's duty?
What does a young child know about
duty? Nothing, until" It "has been In
structed. Even then, very little, until
It has reached school age or even later.
Many mothers are ready to
deny, with indignation, the statement
that their children ever told a story.
Hcv.ever, very few men, noted for their
veracity, can be found who will claim
that, as boys, they never told any sto
ries. !t n-.isht be well for parents to
consider this fact, when they were
about, to judge harshly a child who has
not spoken the truth.

A Hard Matter to Punish Properly.
How many conscientious parents
have been perplexed to know. how they
should punish a child 'who- persists in
telling falsehoods! Mistakes of man
agement here may so easily drive a
child into becoming a confirmed story
teller, not only while a child, but even
after he has reached manhood. Some
children seem to have no sence of hon
esty whatever. They will tell^fetorleg
without any apparent provocation.
Sometimes they will even tell untruths
when against ' their own Interests, so
that it seems impossible to understand
them. Every person of experience has
known such. All know that many of
these have turned out to be most re

HOW TO TRAIN A WAYWARD CHILD TO TELL THE TRUTH
3ieantimc James D'son discovered
that he had lost his watch.
When Janus Dlaon Qf_ the naughty
city discovered that he^had lost his
watch the Orgt step he took in regard
to It was admirable. The first step, to
be Irish, was to stand still and medi
tate en what his metaphysical double
should say to Mrs. Difon of the other
city; in particular if the affair should
reach the newspapers and the omnis
cient reporter should employ his in
alienable right of pertinent scandal.
He escaped with all possible haste from
the witnesses of hla mischance and de
clined to- give his name.
Dison's second step was. to seek out
the front office and obtain a private
interview with the chief; and here for
a moment he made a blunder. He had
the temerity to demand a favor be
fore he had founded its indispensable
baxis in friendship. The chief paused
iq the midst of h|s scrutiny of a pile
of documents; official business was sus
pended everywhere within earshot, and
Mr. Dison listened to the voice of au
thority. The chief was a man of wra^h;
his speech was rude agd his figure of
rhetoric unconventional.
"No. I will not. You will take your
chances "like anybody else. I will keep
nothing quiet. Every dashed up-State
son of a hayrick thinks he can come
down here and play the goat and go
back home an* forgit it. If my town's
tough It's you hoosiers that come down
here and turn yourselves loose an'
make it so. And it's me the newspa
pers roast."
At this point James Dison of the
naughty city was Inspired to remember
that James Dison of the good little, city
owned a block of delegates at the State
capital and was high in the graces of a
plea that it'll cl! be over in a day or
two. Will you gst the push to cough
up?"
"Any thin' doin* afterward?"
"I can't make no deal with you, Rud
erick â you know that well enough. I've
been pretty square with you an' the
push, ain't I? Well, it stands to reason
that I ain't goin' to get a grouch on
if you an' the push do me a favor, don't
it?"
"A'cight. i Forty - eight hours you
said, didn't you? If it's only twenty
four you won't object, I suppose?"
. "It'll make my rep all the better If
it's only twelve's
"A'right. So Ions."
"So long, Ruderiek."
â¢â¢ * â¢
McKlowd was almost a3 popular at
the front office as he was in his push.
From tlvÂ» strict moralist's point of view
his record there was bnd; but there
wt-re some things to h's credit, which
tho moralist docs not understand. The
chief himself had more than once de
clared that if "Ruderick had only had
an 'eddication* he would have ranked
among the salubrious men of history."
It was tlie opinion of Ruderick's Inti
mates that he had made a mark en
viably high without taking the doctor's
degree; but, of course, they judged
him by a standard of their own. The
chief's liking for Ruderick was appre
ciated and respected, in the days when
the chief had been struggling for honor
and promotion in "the street" it fell to
his lot to arrest certain "gentlemen of
fortune" who protested with knife and
fist. The chief might never have come
out of the scrimmage alive if Ruderick
hadn't "happened around" about that
time. The chief, to his credit be It
said, never forgot this coincidence.
"How much time we got, Ruderick?"
asked Billy the Bruiser.
"Twenty-four hours."
"He jus' wants the thimble an 1 the
roll. ain f t that it?"
"No: he wants the gun, too. His Nibs
is hostile, you see, an* this yap from
the country's got the pull, an* it's up to
the chief to make a plunge."
"Will he let the bloke go?"
"Didn't say nothin' 'bout that. P'r
'aps he will after he's let the yap rub
ber at him. I don't give a damn
whether he does or not. It was a
bunglin' job an' the bloke deserves a
"It's up to you, McKlowd."
"I'm dead about it, Um, chief. Just
got out nbed a little while before Curry
found me."
"How about you,. Bllly?" v
"Dead, too. Keeps me busy keepin'
track o' touches t*his side of Â£he river."
"Well, .u touch came off, an' I want
the. thing cleared' up. I'll give it to

should ,'a' come off, an' it's up*to me
to get the gun on' the things. I've got

"Have already .moved in that matter

"Happy to be able to do anything for
you I can." said- the chief, offering the
glad. hand. ?
"A pleasure to have made your ac
quaintance," said Mr. Dison, accepting
the glad hand.
This also was diplomacy; the rest was
business. The chief's face when he met
hla lieutenants was a hurry-up order i

when he suffered with the spleen,- to

had withdrawn from the Front Ofllce,
the chief made the telephone wires

"Go to hell!" grinned Burke.
"Find a telephc-ne," said one of the
crowd, while another called on a man
on a bicycle to "catch that car." and
explained that there was a thief on it.
When they explained also the nature
of the thief and of his company the
bicyclist guessed he was tired and that
they might catch the car themselves.
"If any of you gentlemen wants the
loan of my wheel he can have it." he
said generously; "but for me â tn-day's

to catch stolen trolleys on Friday."
None of the gentlemen wanted the loan

Burke left the trolley soon. In front

"Stop thief!" yelled the chorus in

THERE were two James Disonsâ
one of eminent respectability in a
small city of the Empire State.
and the other "one of the boys"
Jn the naughty city of New York. These
two gentlemen possessed a metaphysi
cal identity with each other and al
ternate existence. When James Dison
of the little city went to the metropolis
to purchase goods, James Dison of the
naughty city received his letters and
answered them; fn particulsr, letters
from Mrs. Dison of the little city, in
reply to which tee insisted, very, prop
erly, on his eagerness to return to the
delights of her society, and added cer
tain instructions demonstrating that
even during his absence hi* thoughts
were of the moral welfare of that com
munity. In return for these courtesies
in the metropolis, when James Dlson
of th-? email city revisited his accus
tomed office it was his practice to sign
and forward to the nauq-fcty city cer
tain checks in payment of bills which
his metaphysical double had con
tracted.
One evening James Dison of the
naughty city found himself possessed
of a roll of "greenbacks" and of a
har.dsoir.e watch, which bore a striking
icscn:blÂ£nco to a sift officially and ora
torically presented in Â«iTebruary, 18 â .
by the Chamber of Commerce and the

UUke a TurkiFh bath. When he had
'â¢mt-rsed frcm the bath and had break
fast, he remembered that ho had an
appointment in Newark at the hour of
10 and that the ideal way to go to that
place is to take the trolley, which he
did.
Burke Ryan was a gentleman who
took his fun where he found it and
to whom the universe owed a living.
In the intervals of his pleasures he
collected what the universe owed him,
and if he discovered it for the most
part in the pockets of other people,
fo much the worse â for the other peo
ple. A man has a right to his own.
At the time when James Dison was
making a night of it. Burke Ryan saw
his v.atch chain and surmised his
watch and took stock of his roll of
bills and his manner and gesture of
never-mind-the-change.
When Dison entered the bathhouse
Burke also entered it. He had not
â¢wanted a Turkish bath, but he took
one. 'What he really wanted was to
"touch" the little sum which was com
ing to him and to go to bed. When
Dison lingered at breakfast Burke also
lingered at breakfast, though with a
growing impatience at the prolix eti
quette of modern time*.
When Dison entered the trolley car
Burke also entered It and took a place
beside him, although he had no busi
ness whatever in the city to which
that gentleman was going. When
Dlson 5l?pt his vratch transferred it
self to Burke's waistcoat; when Dison
woke he discovered in his trousers
pocket the two longest and deftest
fingers of Burke's right hand. Burke
was at once so obliging as to withdraw
the fingers and with them the remnant
of Discn's roll of bills.
Dison seized Burke by the shoulder
and p;Â»ok*Â» his mind with vigor and
idiom. There were two women and
twenty men in the car. The two
women expressed the judgment of

said Roderick soothingly. "Three to
one ain't fair, but It's business. The
chief needs you, an' we need the chief
see?"
It was a chase which -is talked
about still when chases come up for
discussion. It began below Twenty
third street and ended in a vacant lot
near the Eighth-avenue Railroad
terminal, and 13 probably the only pur
suit of a criminal in whose arrest
criminals alone were, interested. Trol
ley cars, cabs and the "elevated" were
all used by both the pursued and the
pursuers, and a fierce struggle ended
the fight. As a last resort Burke took
his stand !n a fence corner of a vacant
lot, drew his razor, and dared Roderick
and his two companions to touch him.
"It's a case o' knock-out," said. Roder
ick and poor Burke was made the tar
get for stones swiftly thrown and care
fully aimed. He stood it as long as he
could, his face and hands being cut and
bruised and smeared all over. -with
blood, and then cried out: "I cave â I
cave!" * ...
"Well, they can go plump to hell.
I ain't no sucker to help out that
chief â let him help hisself out. I'm
goin' to mooch right" â his speech
was cut short by the entrance into the
saloon of Ruderick and two- "pals."
"That's what they are, an" you'll
be settled, too. His 'Nibs is on his ear,
they say, an' the chief's got to square
things."
"Do you mean to say that they're
goin* to turn me over to the chief?"
"They're after you, you duffer." said
Jimmy, "an" they'll have you if you
don't mooch. Yuu've been chewin' the
rag all over town, an' somebody's told
"em by this time."
"Do they jus' want the dough an* the
watch," asked Burke,, "or are they
after me, too?"
There were no silly trips to Jersey
to Inspect "the scene of the crime."
no long Interviews with reporters about
suggested clews, ar.d no "keeping the
wires hot." "Guns" of all ages and
conditions strolled quietly up and down
Manhattan, "rubbering." passing the
time of day and putting people "next."
One would enter a "Joint," Rive a
cough and pa3S en to a rear room
where he was Joined by those whom
his cough had attracted. "Find out
who got that thimble an" the roll on
tha trolley over in Jersey â the chief is
hostile an* wants to know â Roderick
McKlowd is un the ca?e." and another
half dozen recruits were enli3ted for the
honor of the chief.
Gossip about "touches" is as essen
tial to the Under World as is gossip
about marriages and births to the Up
per World. Burke Ryan could no more
forego the pleasure of telling his pals
about the "touch" on the trolley In Jer
sey than he could resist the temptation
to "pull it off." He had "hocked" the
watch and invested the greater part of
the roll in a quiet little game of poker
by the time Ruderick McKlowd and the
push tvrÂ»re on his trail, and he had also
published widely the details of the
theft, only Rutlerick and his compan
ions had not yet reached the "joints"
where the story had been told. At the
very moment thai Ruderick and Billy
the BruUfer were agreeing on the cam
paign to find him. Burke was in a sa
loon not more than ten blocks distant
telling some cronies how he had to
"clear the deck" on the trolley with his
razor to make good his "mooch," and
giving them amusing accounts of how
the "Molls dove out o' the windows" in
their haste to give him room.
Burke had his friends in the push as
well as did Ruderick, and there was
one, Jimmy Ryerson by name, who fell
,that 1t was "up to him" to let Burke
know, that Ruderick and his push were
in pursuit.
The -two men separated and began
"putting . the blokes next." Ruderick
dropped into saloon after saloon, talk

or standing at the bar, and pretty soon
these men were to be seen coming out
on .the street and taking different di
rections. Us talked to .them in a

When we arrived la Australia Happy
Steve' 1 cleared out for the' Swan River
gold diggings. Later, we heard that
he met his finish there, but he died as
he livedâ in a humorou3 way. The ac
count we had stated that he cracked
Â¦some joke up there that wasnlt ap
preciated by the English miners, and
that it precipitated a shooting scrape.
When yie smoke cleared away three
of Stevc'3 opponents were stretched
out. bat he himself had cracked hia
last joke. When told that his Ameri
can humor had not been understood,
hd chuckled immoderately and then
died. â¢ Thi3 account may not be ex
actly true, but It was characteristic of
him.
Some years later I met a man who
had been on the "Southern Cross" on
that same eventful trip, and when I
asked him who was bos'n's mate at
the time, he replied:
.'â¢Why, a humorous sort o* chapâ*

If you were to consult the log ofjthe
American bark Southern Cross, about
eight years back/; you would come
across an entry like this: ?-'-~i\.
"Chief Mate Hardy disappeared In
the middle watch, f Supposed to have
fallen overboard while examining the
log." ~'i, Â¦'â¢Â¦ 'â¢,
Such an entry is common in ships
logs, and it mightVnot excite much"ln
terest in the average shore-abiding rfj-
Izen. but in the maritime world there
are some to whom this would recall
memories of a strange personality-
Happy Steve. Â¦.
How Happy Steys was connected
with the drowning of the mate of_the
Southern Cross will develop later. First
of all, let me Eay a few words of the
mate. â¢ ."â¢*Â£.
Â¦watches were never disturbed, and
every man's artistic ability as a story
teller was in full demand. /?'
One evening the conversation turned
to hard-case Yankee packets, .of ships
where men take and give blows with
deadly intent. Each man told of the
bucko mates he had 'known, and as
almost every one had known Dick ;
Hardy, or Black Jack, he and his mys
terious fate became the principal sub
ject of discussion. *
"He was a bad un," commented
Kanaka Joe, darkly; "blessed if he-4**
waren't. I've known hard-case mates, .
but most of 'em. was on the square in
a fight. Black Jack waren't; he was
a mucker; he'd hit a man when he
was down."
"You bet," agreed another man;
"drownin* was too good for him. He
should 'a' been ham-strung first, then
hung by his arms in the main chains,
an* then blled in a pot o' tar."
Here each man gave his idea of a
flitting end for Black Jack*, and some
were quite ingenious. That is, all
did so except Happy Steve â he only
laughed immoderately as each man
presented his method.
"Come, Steve," said Kanaka Joe,
"how would you have him cooked?"
Steve laughed uproariously, while his
mates grinned in anticipation of a par
ticularly funny account of an imagin
ary death for Black Jack. But Steve's
laughter increased; his face was red
with suppressed merriment.
"Come, Steve," said a Cockney sailor,
encouragingly, . "let's 'ave the joke;
don't be a-keepin' it all to yourself."
"Why, ye blessed galoots," chortled
Steve at last, "I could tell ye a story .
of Black Jack as would make yer eyes
water. Here you chaps is a-talkin"
of Black Jack, with me here as could
tell ye more about him than any man
livin'." And Steve shook with keen
appreciation of the humoc of it.
"Well, ye blarsted ass, why don't ye
tell us?" suggested the Cockney.
"Well," panted Steve, between
spasms, "seein" as how I am with a
crowd as can appreciate the funny side
of 'a good story, I am going to blige
yez.
"Ye see, fellers, I was bos'n's mate of

"Well, I'll be hanged!" ejaculated
several of the men together. Steve

Never in the history of the world
were educational opportunities so
greatly prized or more generally util

that the school or college is not the
only agency responsible fcÂ»r his de

have their function and If there be not
co-operation botiveen them end the
school, if instead, the three work at
cross purposes, the result is likely to
be disastrous to the growing boy or
girl.
Believe also in the highsr education.
not simply the higher education in It*
technical sense, but in that higher edu*
cation which frees and enlarges the
mind and brings into joyous activity
the spiritual .powers. A child is not
educated when he la stuffed with facts.
Neither is he fully educated when h*
is taught to observe and to think with

.There are wise limitations that pre
vent the public school from doing
everything possible along this line. And
yet I know public. school teachers who,
without stepping across the bounds of
propriety, \ do bring their pupils into
touch with the highest things. Cer
tainly in the choice of a private school
or college one may have this end in
view.* And day by day In himself and
in others closest to him one may cul
tivate this sense of the eternal.
THE PARSON. -Â£
AH this modern development gives
greater dignity and importance to the
educational movement And it behooves
the average man, whether he has chil
dren or not, to keep in touch with it.
Don't view the school system entirely
from without. Acquaint yourself with
the forces and personalities concerned
in it Get the point of view of teach
ers and of superintendents. Make them
feel your sympathetic Interest, your
appreciation of .the part which they
play in the life of the city, of the tre
mendous influence for good or evil
which they control.
And wo ought not to expect tco much
of the schools. Tl jy can do a' great
deal, but they cannot do everything.
They cannot," in a few short years, pro

A POINT OR TWO ON EDUCATION
"Have It very wide on the shoulders,"
said she, "and let it "be cut on a' very
deep sailor collar- fashion. Let pieces
of Bruges lace be applied to the shoul
ders and to the middle of the back.
The front must have stoles finished
with- Bruges ends."
Another shoulderette has armholes, .
but it is a tiny affair, cut off almost â¢
at the shoulder blades. Of course.
there is the deep shoulder effect, for
nothing is complete without this long
shoulder line. The front is very open.
The whole is made of a blaek novelty
lace, very tough in its texture, with
Irish crochet lace let in.
Perhaps the most novel of shoulder
ettes is a black lace affair, cut in
square fashion acrcjjs the shoulders
almost like a sailor collar, with a lit
tle green stltchery running through
the lace. There are wide stoles of lace
with great green shamrock leaves let
into the lace.
Still another little shoulder*cape is
cut in collar fashion rounding across
the shoulders and doming down to
long points in front. This is built of
very fine cloth and the whole is
strapped w!th Rilk of the same color
and stitched in tailor-made. fashion.
Another little article for spring wear
is an eton of cloth cut very short. The
sleeves are chopped off above the
elbow and bordered with three rowf
of contrasting stitching. The front is
cut in scallops and there is a. second
row of scallops falling over the first
row. \
A novelty which bears n Parisian,
stamp shows a little shoulder cape
built like a bertha. It is high In the
neck, is Cut off at the bust line and is
finished with a ruffle of silk. It but
tons in the back. The front is trimmed
with a silk applique put. on flat.
The Very Pagrfonablc Bertha.
The bertha is undoubtedly one of the
inj>st fashionable of summer features,
and all sorts of tricks are tried to simi
late it upon, gowns that have no ber
tha, and particularly upon the old
short waists, to make them look like ;
new. 1 A bertha freshens up an old
shirt waist wonderfully, and if it can'
bÂ«* arranged upon a blouse of silk it
gives it a certain tone that is unmis
takably fashionable and very becoming
tu th<>. firjure. 1 ' . v " . ' â¢Â¦'
A French modiste, with many a little
, trick of dressmaking, is taking very
wide needlework, as line as her patron
can afford, and is gathering it into a
ruffle. This she sews along the yoke of
a wash '.shirt waist, outlining the yoke,,
in pointed fashion.' The effect is lovely!
But, of course, it can only be done
when the waist opens in the back.
.One of the finest of silk blouses is
built of percaline blue louisine. It is
buttoned down the back with Dresden
buttons. The front is tucked a"s to the
yoke. Outlining the yoke is a deep
flounce of Mechlin lace. The sleeves
are finished with a wide cult of chiffon
and Mechlinâ a lingerie cuff.
The high-necked bertha effect is seen
not only upon the wash gowns, but o\i
silk blouses as well, and not only. in
the cheaper waists, but in waists of
velvet of velours, of handsome brocade
and of the most expensive lace blouses.
An exquisite blouse for the Duchess of
Manchester was made almost entirely
of point and duchess, lace, with a deep
ruffle of point lace across the front,
put on in such a manner as to give
the bertha effect And another hand
some blouse was made of real Irish
crochet lace, with a pointed bertha in
front

green, atf conspicuous in its â¢ way us
hunting. "pink." is to be found in all
the best cloths and broadcloths. It
makes up very 'well into street suits
and can be - modified somewhat by
black braiding or by stitched bands of
black taffeta. !
Another green which will be much
observed Is moss green, and this com
bined -with deep tan wjil be extremely
fashionable. A moss green cloth
gown , is trimmed with lace and with
bands of deep tan colored cloth. The
bands f are : applied with black stitch
ing and there was a tiny black figure
appllqued Into the lace.
Women are always at a loss
what to" wear and who fall back upon
black a3. a safe resort, can take their
choice of a perfectly safe list of grays,
prominent among which is castor
gray, which comes in two shades, light
castor and deep castor. Both can be
trimmed with black and with either
tone there la a shade of blue, the pret
ty porcelain blue, which Is very eat-
Isfactory indeed.
Pearl gray, Irish gray and oyster
gray are all to be worn and all can be
found In the popular fabrics of the
season, voile, velours and the long list
of soft veilings and silks.
A Sensible Woman's Gown.
The tunic or overskirt fell over a deep
flounce, -which, in turn, fell over an
other deep flounce, the ; latter of
sweep length. Bdth flounces and the
tunic were bordered with chiffon vel
vet. The waist was cut in Eton fash-
Ion, with scalloped fronts, wnile a
great puffed sleeve was caught in at
'the wrist into a tight little cuff.
A. great many street gowns are not
so sensible* as this, and one looks with
amazement at the delicate fabrics that
are intended for street wear. Many of
them are light In color as well as frail
of texture, and one cannot help won
dering . how, where and why women
will wear them. -
A conspicuous example of the frailty
.of feminine^wearlng apparel is afforded
by a glimpse at a gown of black net
dotted with silk knots. There Is a deep
flounce which is embroidered in black
silk and above the flounce there are
Very large wheels of thread crocheted
and set Into the goods. Above these
â¢ there are wheels of real duchesse cut
' out of the lace and applied.
The waist is quite a dream in black
net and French knots, with the bertha
effect in front and Immensely wide
sleeves ending in the lingerie cuff.
While black net can hardly be rec
ommended for street wear, it must be
admitted that there is an entirely new
quality of net which is capable of
standing a 'great deal. It is tough and
durable and rather fine in mesh. Â¦ It is
very satisfactory, indeed, for street
wear, such as calling" "or for short ex
peditions when one goes afoot It looks
dressy and admits of such a pretty va
riety cf trimming.
A black net of close weave, tough
yet very silky In effect, was lined with
. leaf green taffeta. It was trimmed
with a heavy flounce of the net, faced
', with black taffeta, and upon the flounce
, there was a little hand embroidery in
, black silks and in green. Bands of taf
feta were stitched to the skirt In panel
shapes. . , '.*;.
A Senson for Dressmakers.'

: to do one's own sewing, so even the
most competent amateur dressmakers
admit, and the modiste must be called
A gown which would have taken a
medal for sensibility, with a great deal
of beauty thrown In, was in tobacco
brown cheviot, spring weight. The
skirt was laid in plaits across the hips
find back" and each plait was stitched
fiat. The skirt, had tfie" tunic effect.
A button as large as a crabapple Is
made of sun metal and. Inclosing the
gun me"tal, there is a little netting of
silver. These buttons, besides being as
large as a crabapple, are much the
same shape, with a shank to corre
spond- with the stem of the apple.
For the - amateur's busy fingers
there is one safe trimming and this is
the fashionable jet Jets come In all
designs and the jetted bands an Inch
and two Inches wide make the most
becoming trimmings for silk bodices
of any color. Jets are used a great
deal upon black and the Jetted
flounces are as fashionable as they
ever were. Jets are also seen upon
collars and cuffs, and jets are used to
trim yokes and girdles and to deco
rate the lace insets, without which no
handsome gown is complete. J
Should the amateur be very desir
ous of getting into colors, let her
choose mode â¢ or castor or pearl, let
her select the wine colors â claret,
champagne, absinthe green and bur-*
gundy; let her select .violet, purpleX
lilac and sage, and let her not forget
that geranium, rose, coral and toma
to are fashionable. But most import
ant of all is it for her to get a good
model, for without this no amateur
can successfully make a gown for the
coming summer. ,.<r ;
For back triinmlngs there are the
crocheted drops and ends; there are
the fringes; there are the lattices of
ribbon, and, more than all, there are
the buttons, and of these there is no
limit at all.'
The button question is one that
might well keep the amateur awake
through a worrisome night. Buttons
come in all known metallic materials
and In a great many that are not rec
ognized as metals at sight, yet which,
look and wear like metal. . "%
And there is another don.'t. Don't
forget the back of your gown. That
must be well fitted and abundantly
trimmed, for the day of the old plain
back is gone by. The trimming con
sists of double shoulder capes, of
handsomely scalloped collars, of band3
of lace insertion applied across the
shoulders, and it includes the panel,
the lace inset, the worked wheel and
many other things.
there are very heavy veilings that arÂ«^
lovely. Cheviot comes in very fine
and almost smooth grades, and, if you
have only one or two street gowns, do
not neglect your chance to get a nice
fine serge.
The first cape of spring will be re
markable for . it* size, which will be
v<;ry diminutive, and for Its trimming,
vhich will be very plentiful. The tiniest

investigation continues you are given
more and more of a treat. The mer

shoppers.
"My Easter gown is made of deep
red ve'.vet," announced a woman at a
woman's luncheon. "I find that it Is
the most durable material for this time
of year.
"A nice velvet gown of medium
Â¦wfi&M. not the -heavy velvets nor bro
iidtt. but a plain tone, will wear nice- ,
ly ps !onj as you want it. Such a
gown is dressy for Easter wear. It is
comfortable until the warm days come
~rd for calling and for informal re
ception ticcasii-ns it Is ideal. It goes
veil with any hat and is neither too
plain nor too dressy."
The logic of this woman was unan
swerable, for the velvets are certainly
veiy attractive, especially those de
signed for spring: wear. They are by
no mears the heavy court velvets nor
Hie gi eat and ceremonious brc-caded
velvets, but the lighter weights, which
can be made up In the latest styles
WHS can be draped almost like cloth.
First of all there are chiffon velvets,
which t re exquisite for trimming pur
)>osfci5 and which make the loveliest
i-tocks ar.d wide crush belts. You will
find a little chiffon velvet almost In
dispensable in the summer wardrobe,
v.hiie the pannes and plain velvets are
admirable for inserts and other trim
mings.
â¢ It is to be a great season for mate
rials. One manufacturer declared that
he had turned out a hundred absolutely
new materials, most of them disguised
tirder well known names. There were
a great many.velvets in the list, rang
ing from the very heavy weight to the
light or chiffon velvet, and there were
velveteens* which were as soft and as
line as velvet.
Under the name of crepe de chine
there now come three or four different
materials, seme of them as heavy as
cashmere andjust as durable, while in
CfcEhmere there is a wide assortment,
the heaviest and finest of which looks
Â»r> much like cloth that__you can scarce
ly distinguish. Batistes, too. . co'rne In
all weights and of many grades, some
Â«f th? rretliest gowns being built of
silk and linen batiste, while othere, also
called batistes, are very sheer, so -that
you can eee your hand through them.
The woman who Is going to buy only
rne sown will, indeed, be in a perplex
ity which material to chootc. for the;
â¢ eunters are spread with the most al
luring goods. . Â¦ "
Easter comes so early this year that
one hardly looks for the" brilliancy ot .
other seasons when the great eprlng
day comes later. The first week_of
April is very little better than the last
wer-k in March from a standpoint cf
comfort, and unless the sun shines very
brightly there will be very little Easter
display.
But new f-jtrlng gowns will be worn,
and these will be characterized by cer
tain new features. A gown of moss
green broadcloth, thin and pliable but
possessed of the peculiar dignity which
el ways goes with broadcloth, is made
with a four-gored skirt trimmed around
the foot with a Grecian pattern. There
is a coat with attached tails, and the
front of the coat has two long stoles
falling down below the waist line.
A feature of the new stoles is their
trimming. Far from being plain, they
are very elaborately planned. One very
handsome coat has an open vest with
rtoles, falling one over the other, like
little scalloped capes.
If you are a decided amateur cling
to the old favorites as being a little
more familiar in their texture and con
sequently easier to handle than the
new onea. Examine the newest grades
of cashmere and do not forget that
a good model. If you cannot obtain
one then" stick to white or to black, to
gray or to bine, or. ir you prefer it.
to golden brown. Don't mix things up. '
Before you make your gown consider
the use to which you are going to put
it. You would not purchase your fur
niture without knowing how and
whjere you are going to use it. Fol
low the same rule with your gown.
If you have a traveling gown in
mind begin by remodeling an old last
year's suit. Few women travel suf
ficiently to need a dress for this pur
pose alone. Why not take an old gown
and_ lengthen it with n. flounce. Fit
double capes to the shoulders and ar
range them so that they can be taken
off. Rln off your old cuffs and fit
gauntlets, or turn-over cuffs, to your
sleeves.
Remember that gowns are to be
worn either very short or very long,
and, for traveling, the long gown Is so
very pretty. Besides, one does not
walk when one i3 on boat or traln.^
and there is little -or no necessity for'
the short gown.

Even in the management of children,
whipping was never resorted to as pun
ishment for disobedience. In fact,
children were always treated in such a
kind, patient, loving manner that diso
bedience was a fault rarely known.
In the early days of the settlement it
seemed to be the universal custom* of
the Indians along the foothills of the
Sierra Nevada range of mountains to
burn the bodies of their dead. A suit
able pile of readily combustible wood
was prepared. .The body was taken
charge of by persons to perform the
last sacred rites, and firmly bound In
skins and blankets and then placed
upon the funeral pyre with all the per
sonal effects of the deceased, together
with numerous offerings from friends
and relatives. The chief mourners of
the occasion seemed to take but little
active part in the ceremonies. When
all was ready one of the assistants
would light the fire and the terrible,
wailing, mournful cry would com
mence, and the professional chanters,
with peculiar sidling movements and
frantic gestures, would circle round
and round the burning pile. Occasion
ally, on arriving at the norttftvest cor
ner of the pile, they would stop, and,
pointing to the west, would end a cry
ing refrain by exclaiming "Him-I-la
ya." When these became exhausted
others would step in and take their
places and thus keep up the mournful
ceremony until the whole pile was con
sumed.

more wives. Some of the chiefs and
head men would have wives from sev
eral adjacent tribes, which had a ten
dency to establish permanent friendly
relations among them.
Every man who took a young woman
for his wife had to buy her. Young
women â¢ were considered by their
parents as personal chattels, subject to

were used as commercial property and
peddled out in the mining camps and
gambling saloons for money to buy
food, clothing or whisky, this latter ar
ticle being obtained through the aid of
some white persons in violation of law.
Their miserable, squalid condition of
living opened the way for diseases of a
malignant character, which their medi
cine men could not cure, and their
number was rapidly reduced by death.
At the present. time there are not in

Monos, a tribe from the Eastern side
of the Sierras, with whom they had
quarreled, and 'the old chief and many
of his warriors were .killed.
In 1855, after four years . of confine
ment on the reservation, an agreement
was made with the Indian Commis
sioners by the head men' of the 'tribes
that if their people were again allowed
their freedom they would -forever re
main at peace with the .white settlers,
and they would try to support them
selves free of expense, to the Govern
ment. They were soon permitted to
leave, and have "ever since faithfully
kept their promise.
Most of them went back to the vicin
ity of their old homes and made tem
porary settlements on unoccupied Gov
ernment land, as many of their old vil
lage sites | were now in possession of
white settlers. As there was a very
large crop of acorns that season, .they
gathered an abundant supply for win
ter use, and, with what was given
them in the way of food and clothing
by some of the white settlers, they
managed to get through the winter
fairly well.
Their four rears' residence on the
reservations, however, had been more
of a school in the vices of the "whites
than one of a higher education. They
became demoralized socially, addicted
to many bad habits and left the reser
vations in worse condition than when
they were taken there. Their old tribal
relations and customs were nearly
broken up, though. they still had their
head. Â¦ men to whom they looked for

As the country became more settled
much of .' their: main food supply, the
acorn, was consumed by the Â¦ domestic
animals of the ranchers and their mode
of I living became - more precarious and
transitory, and many, of them Â» were at
times in a condition near to starvation.
In these -straitened and desperate cir
cumstances many of their young women
Teneiya was finally allowed to depart
with hla fatnilv after havintr been on
It was during this campaign that
Major Savage and his men discovered
the Yosemite Valleyâ about the 21st
day of March, 1851â while in pursuit of
the Yosemites, under old Chief Teneiya,
for whom Lake Teneiya and Teneiya
Canyon have appropriately been
named.
And then the Government did what It
considered the best possible thing for
these people. It provided ample food
supplies, blankets, clothing and cheap
fancy articles for the comfort and
pleasure of the Indians on the reserva
tion, and for a short time it seemed
the best policy, as they enjoyed the
novelty of their new mode of living.
The young, able-bodied men were put to
work clearing, fencing and cultivating
fields for hay and vegetables, and in
this way they were partially self-sup
porting. A large portion of them,
however, soon began to tire of the re
straints imposed and longed for their
former conditions of freedom and
many of them sickened and died.
Old Teneiya, chief of the "Grizzlies,"
was particularly affected by the change
in his surroundings and by the humili
ation of defeat. He suffered keenly
from the hot weather of the- plains,
after his free life in the mountains, and
begged to be allowed to return to his'
old home, promising not to disturb the
white settlers j in â¢ any way, 'a pledge
which he did ' not break.
But the Yosemites and one or two
other bands of Indians refused to sur
render, and retreated to their mountain
strongholds, where they proposed to
make a last determine" resistance.
Active preparations were accordingly
made by the State authorities to follow
them and either capture or exterminate
all the tribes Involved. For this rea
son a body of State volunteers known
as the Mariposa Battalion was organ
ized under the command of Major
James D. Savage to pursue these tribes
into the mountains; and, after many
long marches and some fighting, the
Indians were all defeated, captured,
and, with their -women and ' children,
put upon the reservations under strong
military guard.
The breaking out of actual hostili
ties created great excitement, and an
urgent call was made upon the Gov
ernor of the State for military forces
to meet the emergency and protect the
settlers â a band strong enough toÂ«thor
oughly subdue the Indians and remove
all of them to the reservations to be
selected by the Indian Commissioners
for that purpose.
Meantime the Governor and the
Commissioners, who had then* arrived,
were receiving numerous communica
tions, many of them from persons of
high rank, earnestly urging a more hu
mane and just policy, averring that the
Indians bad real cause for complaint;
that they had been "more sinned
against than sinning," since the set
tling of California by the whites, and
that they were justly entitled to pro
tection by the Government and com
pensation for the spoliations and griev
ances that they had suffered. \
Probably these protests had some In
fluence in delaying hostile measures,
and in the inauguration of efforts to
induce the Indians to come in and
treat with the Commissioners, envoys
being sent out to assure them of fair
treatment and personal safety. Many
of them accepted this offer, and as the
different tribes surrendered they were
taken to the two reservations which the
Commissioners had established for
them on the FresiiO River, the principal
one being a few miles above the place
where the town of Madera is now lo
cated.
As before stated, these Indians were
not a warlike people. Their only.weap
ons were their bows and arrows, and
these they soon found nearly useless in
defending themselves at long Â¦â¢ range
against soldiers armed with rifles.
Moreover, their stock of provisions was
so limited that they either had to sur
render or starve.
To prepare for this struggle for
existence they made raids upon some
of the leading posts in the mining
sections, killed those in charge, took
all the blankets, clothing and , pro
visions they could carry away, and
fled to the mountains, where they were
soon pursued by the soldiers and vol
unteer citizens and a spirited battle
was fought without a decisive advan
tage to either side.
But finally the chiefs and leading
men of all the tribes involved met in
a grand council and resolved to com
bine their warrior forces in one grand
effort to drive all the white enemies
from the country before they became
more numerous and formidable.

families, who, in many instances, were
in a condition of starvation.
PROBABLY just about one in
every hundred tourifcts that visit
the Yosemite Valley ever takes
the trouble to ask the meaning
of its Indian name or ever even
thinks of much less inquires into the
fanciful legends that played such an
Important part in the lives of the red
men and in the early history of the
country.
In the first place the valley was not
called "Yosemite." but Ah-wah-nee.
n-nlcfa means "deep grassy valley," and,
the Ah-wah-nee-chees were a large and
5Â»j\verfu! tribe, but on account of a
dreadful black siekr.ers and war the
'Â¦and was about destroyed and the few
that were left flc-d from the stricken
country in gr#at haste.
Bo it happened th2t for many years
the great valley was uninhabited and
the game was at liberty to travel the
length and breadth of the land un
mblcstedJ But finally Teneiya, who
claimed to be a descendant of the great
chief Ah-wah-nee, gathered some of
his fathers tribe about him and
claimed the valley as the birthplace
Of his people. It followed, as a matter
of course, that he became the founder
of the new tribe and straightway the
valley was christened "Yo-sem-i-te,"
' which signifies a full grown bear, and
his people adopted the name because
those who bestowed it were afraid of
the grizzlies, and also feared his band.
Then, unlike many of the warlike
tribes, they divided the territory be
tween them and settled down to lead
a peaceful life. "When trouble of any
description arose, instead of fighting, as
any erf the other tribes west of the
Sierra Nevadas would, the chiefs ar
ranged a council at which all the head
men cf the tribes were represented, and
the matter was settled by arbitration
\ rather than by brute strength.
All was serene when the first parties
of prospecting miners Invaded their
lands, and the Indians welcomed them
with their characteristic hospitality and
. were much Interested in the gold min
ing that they saw carried on about
them. It took them but a very short
while to learn the value of the gold
dust, and some of them straightway
engaged in mining and bartered their
"diggin's" for trinkets, such as beads
and gayly colored blankets, at an im
mense proflt to the traders, and the
feeling that prevailed for a time was
one of peace and good will.
In a remarkably short time, however,
reports of the rich gold mines spread
and miners by the thousands came and
took possession of the whole country,
paying no regard to the natural rights
or wishes of the Indians.
Then some of the chiefs made the
proposition that if \he miners would
give them some of the gold which they
found In their part of the country they
might stay and work. This offer was
not listened to by the miners, and a
large majority of the invaders treated
the Indians as though they had no
rights whatever to be respected. It
bo chanced in some instances where
the Indians had found and were quiet
ly working a gold mine they were for
cibly driven away by white miners,
who promptly took possession of their
claims and worked them.
Moreover, the Indians saw that their
main sources of food supply were rap
idly being destroyed. The oak trees,
which croduced the acorn â one of
their staple articles of food â were be
ing cut down and burned by the
miners and others in clearing up the
land for cultivation, and the deer and
the other food game were being rap
idly killed off or driven away from the
locality.
Dut this wasn't all. In the "early
days," before California was admitted
as a free State Into the Union, it was
reported, and was probably true, that
some cf the immigrants from the
slave-holding States took the Indians
and made slaves of them in working
their claims. It was no uncommon
event for the sanctity of their homes
and families to be invaded by some of
the "baser 6ort" and young women
taken, willing or not, fcr servants
and wives.
In retaliation, and as some compen
sation for these many grievous_ out
rages upon their natural, inalienable
rights of domain and property, and
their native customs, the Indians stole
Jiorses and mules from the white set-
The old Indians were and are very
reticent regarding their religious be
liefs. Thej' hold them too sacred to be
exposed to possible ridicule, and it Is
therefore very difficult to get informa
tion from them by direct questions.
They seem, however, to have a vague.
Indistinct belief or tradition that their
original ancestors in a long-forgotten
past dwelt in a better and much more
desirable country than this, in tha
El-o-wln. and that by some misfortun*
or great calamity they were separated
from that happy land and became wan
derers in thi? Tart o* the world. They
also believe that the spirits of all good
Indians will be permitted after death
to go' back to that happy country ot
their ancestors* origin, but that thÂ«
spirits of bad Indians have to serve an
other earth life in the form of a grizzly
bear as a punishment for their former
crimes. Hence no Indians ever eat beax
meat if they know it.
All the old Indians are spiritualists
and very superstitious in their religious
beliefs. Or.e special tenet is that if ona
of their friends has been murdered ha
will not receive them on terma of
friendship in the spirit world unless
tbey avenge his death, by either killing
the murderer or som? one of the sama
blood. This queer belief sometimes re
sults in an entirely innocent person be-Â»
ing put to death.
They all have a great fear of evil
spirits, which they believe have tha
power to do them much harm and de
feat their undertakings. They also hava
a fairly distinct idea of a deity or great
spirit, who never does them any harm
and whose home 13 In the happy land

The clothing of the- Indian was very
simple and scant before being Initiated
into the use of a more ample and com
plete style of covering while living at
the reservations. The ordinary full
complement of dress for a man (Nung
ah) was simply a breech clout, or short
hip skirt, made of skins; that of a
woman (O-hoh) was a skirt reaching
from the v.aist to the knees, made of
dressed deer skin finished at the bot
tom with a slit fringe, and sometimes
decorated with various fancy orna
ments. Both men and women frequent
ly wore moccasins made of dressed
deer or elk skin. Young children gener
ally went entirely nude.
Their winter huts, or o-chums. as
they termed them, were Invariably oi
a conical form, made with small poles
and covered with the bark of the in
cense cedar. A few poles ten or twelve
feet long were set in the ground around
en area of about twelve feet In diam
eter, with their tops inclined together.
The outside was then closely covered
with long strips, of the cedar bark,
making it perfectly water tight. An
opening was also left at the top for the
escape of the smoke, a fire being
kindled in the center inside.
One of these huts would hold a fam
ily of half a dozen persons, with all
their household property, dogs includ
ed' and there is no other form of a
single-room dwelling that can be kept
warm and comfortable in cold weather
with so litt'-e fire as this o-chum.
Their underbedding usually consists
of the skins of bears, deer, antelope or
elk, and the top covering was a blank
et or robe made of the skins of small
fur-bearing animals, such as rabbits,
hares, wildcats and foxes.
Most of the older Indians still cling
to their o!d customs and manner of
living, and are very slow to learn or
talk our language, but the younger
ones are striving to live like the white
people, and seem proud to adopt our
style of dreS3 and manner of cooking.
As a rule they are trustworthy, and
when confidence i3 placed in their hon

The principal reason for burning the
bodies of the dead was the belief that
there is an evil spirit waiting and
watching for the animated spirit or
soul to leave the body that he may get

darkness and misery. By burnijfe tha

Immortal soul would be quickly re

The young women took great care of

THE Indians shown in the rare
photograph reproduced herewith
are the "Arabs of* the Great
American Desert." They are a
family of the New Mexican Indians of
the poorest class, and the life they live
is as primitive, if not far more primi-
tive, than ' that of their lowliest or
earliest ancestors, notwithstanding that
they wear clothes having some sem
blance to the apparel of present day
civilization. Their home cannot even be
dignified with the modest name of
"hut." It is nothing more nor less than
a heaped-up pile of brush and scraps of
rags and blankets, affording but very
poor shelter even from the sun by day,
and having no warmth at night, for on
the desert none is needed. And yet.
notwithstanding their poverty and the
squalor of their lives, as shown in the
photograph, they are a very contented
little band of Nomads.
Despite all thfi learned prolixity of
cerebralists the mysterious something
which constitutes the difference be
tween genius and insanity persistently
defies definition. Such-knowledge as
we have of it, if knowledge it can be
called, is purely speculative. We
know that two intellects with mech
anisms as like in physical aspect as
two peas may produce results as un
like as chaos to cosmos â the I one a
generator of wild futility; the other
militant force in forwarding civiliza
tion. But why this three pounds of
gray convolutions is what it is, and
why that three pound3 of apparently
similar convolutions is what it is, we
may make but the veriest guess. Dr.
Edward Anthony Spitzka's report
upon his analysis of the brain of
George Francis Train in no wise clears
up this perplexity. Indeed, so far as
the layman Is concerned, it serves to
bring the puzzle into striking relief.
The noted specialist reached this con
clusion: "The brain, shows a superior
degree of complexity In its surface
morphology. No lesion of any kind
and no deformity, atrophy or anomaly
are discoverable."
Roughly speaking, this means that
Train's brain was extraordinarily well
developed and free from deficiencies.
To all outward appearance it should
have been the source of great Ideas
and the master of their sane execu
tion. Yet we know that, despite the
fact that he made his name known
the world around, his was a Bingularly
futile career. Though he repeatedly
gave evidence of having far more than
the average intellectual power â dis
played talenis which seemed at times
to justify his quaint conceit that he
"felt like a cocoanut In a bag of pea
nuts" â he always stopped short of
great achievement. Instead of being

While the pocket-stocking is unde

all her money in her stocking, she

It is an interesting instinct that
makes woman carry things about in
her stocking. When and how did she
come bv it? It ssoms reasonable to
suppose that since women's garments
are usually so destitute of -"ckets
necessity has driven her to use her
stocking for that purpose. Hence a
woman's hose 'has come to be a gen
erally accepted receptacle for every
tnlnsr, from pin money to a powder
rag.
Buyers from Xew York state that
hose manufacturers urc now making
pockets in women's stockings.
Now that hosemakers have taken
the lnltiatlVe in this matter, it is
strange that they didn't think of the
stocking scheme for women eons ago,
for from time immemorial, woman â
poor creature! â has been using: her
stocking for a shopping bag.
The pocket hose bids fair to become
a popular fad.

E. W. Nelson, who spent between
four and five years in investigating for

about Bering Strait, says: "On sev

there. r>our ice water over their backs
and shoulders with a wooden dipper,
apparently experiencing the greatest
pleasure from the operation."
Although the Eskimo boys seem to
withstand such a bath as this all

in all probability kill any white boy
who tried it. '
Owing to the intense heat, the
bathers are obliged to wear respirators
to protect their lungs. There respira

vex on the outside, and large enough
to cover the mouth, nose and part of
the cheeks of the wearer. Across the
inside runs a little Wooden bar, which
is held in the teeth to keep the respir
ator in place. The boys sit there un
til they are dripping wet with perspir

Daikoku is represented in modern art
as a sturdy figure wearing the ancient
dress of a well-to-do Chinese burgher,
a short coat, girded at the waist, loose
breeches and a pair c-f huge boots that
completely engulf his lower limbs. The

is always broad with goed humor, and
his whole person is the expression of
prosperity. .Devotees to his shrine al
ways find him rearsuring. He is fre
quently spoken of as the cod of the live
cereals.
But the cod par excellence of the
common people is Hotel. He is the
least dignified of tho seven. He has no
place in the trinity acknowledged by
most theologians. He is as well known
as is Santa Claus in our country. His
selection as one of the gods of good for

and is the emblemâ as femininity
should beâ of harmony. If pictorial
art is to be credited, the other gods of
good fortune rarely go off on a lark
without Benten. There is close con

Benten and snakes, due largely to the

To no graven Image, but to the living
Godâ the God of Revelationâ does the
se-ldler of the Tsar of all the Russians
lift his heart for guidance and protec

enemy. In keeping with the Roman
Catholic belief in "the communion of
saints," he implores the intercession of
St. Nicholas, If he be a middy, and that
of St. George, if he is of tho land twees.
Unlike the Roman, the Greek church
does not countenance plastic art as a
medium of devotion.
The Russian ikon, or image. Is a
painted representation of the saint
venerated. There are- no statues of
saints in the Greek churches, nor do
th-ir amulets of devotion take the form
of graven images. Fear of confounding
tho graven symbol with the real God
in the minds of the people is the Greek
church's reason for rejecting the plastic
art in the representation of its saints.

INVOKING THE ANCIENT GODS OF WAR IN THE EAST
IN this view of the World's Fair,
which opens on April SO next, al
most the entire exposition area is
shown. Tho grounds are 9500 feet
long and 6000 feet from north to
K>uth. The view is from a point above
tho northeast corner of the grounds.
What is called the "main picture" of
the exposition occupies the northeast
ern section.
Following the picture from the south
eastern gate, at the upper left hand
side of the r'cturc, around the north
eastern fronts <>f the several great
building t<Â» the western limits, the dis
tance is nearly two and three-quarter
miles.
Thp four prcat buildings most promi
nent in the rictuie ar.d nearest tho
observer, beginning with the Liberal
Arts <:i the left and taking the Palaces
of Manufactures. Varied Industries and
Transportation, have frontages of 300
feet more than a mile. The Govern
ment buildir.gand the Government Fish
eries building are seen in the left of
the picture, with Slate buildings and
the great Inside Inn beyond them. Tho
Government building is upon a high
elevation and from its porticos and
loggias many interesting views are ob
tained.
The two larjzo buildings nearest tho
Government building are the Palaces
of Liberal Arts and Mines ;;nd Met
allurgy. Next come the Plaza of Or
leans and the Palaces of Manufac
tures and Education. The broad space
which divides the main group into two
parts is known as the Plaza St. Louis.
The prominent feature of this place is
the Louisiana Purchase monument,
which stands near the north end of the
Grand Basin. The surroundings of this
plaza form the "central picture" of the
exposition.
The Festival Hall, which is 200 feet
in diameter and 200 feet high, with at
tendant colonnades on either side, and
the beautiful restaurant pavilions ter
minating them, closes the view on the
southwest. Upon the slopes between
tho col->nn:ide3 and the Grand Basin
are the great cascades and rainbow
gardens, giving extraordinary color and
life to the scene.
Behind the Festival Hall are seen
the lour grout buildings, representing
an expenditure of over a million dol
lars, devoted to the displays of fine
arts. They contain a total of 135 gal
leries and the exhibits will constitute
tho largest art display ever shown.
Tho buildings on the west side of
the Plaza St. Louis are tho Palace of
Varied Industries, which is nearest
tho observer, und the Palace of Elec
tricity. The Plaza St. Anthony is next
west of those buildings.
The Palace of Transportation, cover
ing fifteen acres, and the Palace of
Machinery, with its many towers, arÂ»
the next buildings westward. Upon
the high ground, southwest of tho Pal
ace of Machinery, is the Palace of
Agriculture, covering twenty acres.
South of the Palace of Agriculture is
the Palace of Horticulture. Westward
from tha Palace of Agriculture is the
Philippine reservation of forty acres,
where 1000 Filipinos will be at home
during the exposition.
The foreign section is seen beyond
the Palace of Transportation. Among
the fins buildings here are thoss of
Belgium, Brazil, Great Britain, France,
Italy, China, Sweden, Austria. Nica

take place, is in the western p*trt of
the grounds. The Physical Culture
building und tho athletic field, with
seating arrangement."? for 25,000 peo-
pie, are also In the western section.
The reservation of thirty acres for
the Government Indian exhibit and
another reservation of six acres for a
map of the United States in living
plants are west of the Palace of For
t'Stry, Fish and Game.
Near tho Palace of Agriculture is the
great floral clock. 112 foet in diameter,
and the lake In which the United States
life-saving corps will give daily exhibi
tions.
In the foreground is seen the "Pike,"
the amusement street ot the exposition.
It begins in -the eastern part of the
grounds with the Tyrolean Alps, which
cover ten acres or more, and winds
around tho .west end of the Transpor
tation end Machinery palaces to a point
near the Art Building, ending with the
reproduction of the city of Jerusalem,
which covers eleven acres. In this dis
tance of nearly two miles will be seen
the most novel entertainments that
ingenious- showtren have been able to
.devise. Among them is an international
Irish exhibition, showing the industries
of Ireland, with Parliament House,
Blarney Castle and other notable build
ings. The animal show is a very large
affair. Asia will give many interesting
glimpses of Oriental life. The Chinese
village and the Streets of Cairo will
furnish very interesting pictures of
Eastern customs. Creation is a won
derful illusion. Under and Over the Sea
will furnish unusual experiences. The.
Galveston Hood will show how a great
city was destroyed by a tidal wave.
The tire-fighting exhibition will show a
modern fire company in actual warfare
with the flames, using all of the most
modern apparatus. New York to the
North Tole is a magnificent feature, re
plete with Interest. Jerusalem will be
the objective point of the Bible stu
dents from everywhere.
An intramural railway, having
fourteen miles of track, will carry the
visitor to the many interesting points
within the grounds. Tho exposition
is fortunate in having a site which
furnishes a variety of scenery and
abundant shade. Instruction and
pleasure will be mixeG in fine pro
portions and thp visitor's days at the
exposition will fly all too quickly.
The total area of the exposition Is
1240 acres. The estimated cost of the
great enterprise is placed at $50,000,
tiOO. exclusive of the value of the ex
hibits. It is estimated that the ex
hibits in the machinery palace alone
are worth $8,000,000.
The opening day is set for Satur
day, April 30. and tho exposition will
continue seven months, to December
1 next.
In comparison with the largest for
mer exposition, the Columbian
"World's Fair at Chicago In 1S03, the
world's fair at St. Louis occupies near
ly twice the amount of land and 50
per cent more exhibit space. In every

At the end of a beautiful summer, when
the evenings begin to "close in" and
there are signs of approaching winter,
we feel very sorry; but when winter
does actually come we find it is
not without its good things, and we
accept it cheerfully. In the same way
we should accept old age, and riot kick
against it and then we shall find that
it has blessings and, that it need not by
any means be a winter of discontent.
Old age cannot be called an evil when
it is taken as , Miss Mitford, the* au
thoress of "Our Village," , took it. . She
retained her good temper, her enjoy

People are quite right in these days of

Â¦When they have got enough, and give
the younger generation a chance. In
every town and parish, however, there
is much work needing to be done by
some one, that would save the old from
the ; pains and ugly effects of idleness,
and remunerate them largely though
not in material coin. If the man who

why he remained so long in this lite,
he answered, "Because I have nothing
whereof I can accuse ray old age."
Sometimes old age, when it is free
from great infirmities, trials and pri
vations, is the most tranquil, and, per
hap, on the whole the happiest period
of life. The passions and ambitions
of other /days have passed. Time has
allayed animosities and subdued
asperities of character. St. Martin's
summer lights with a pale but beauti
ful gleam the brief November day. It
is pleasant to feel in oneself and Â¦ to
notice in others the sourness of im
mature and. unripe youth disappear
ing with the advance of years. Just
before he died the American poet,
Walt Whitman; said, "As I grow older
I am more and more ready to take the
good there is in men and authors,
without concerning myself about the
bad." It is only poor wine that grows
sour with age.
White hairs, which have been called
"the flowers of the cemetery," may not
of themselves always inspire respect,
but they cannot fail to do so when
they point to a. long life that has been
well spent.
Here in China, where the writer is
now living, old age is much venerated
and it is considered a compliment to
inquire after your "honorable teeth,"
the conventlonable phrase employed in
asking people their age. The Chinese
admire a long beard and estimate age
by the length of it, because social usage
only allows a man to grow old when he
is a grandfather, or at least 45 years
old. "What is your honorable age?" a
Chinaman asks when introduced to a
new acquaintance. "My insignificant
years do not number more than thirty,"
may be the modest reply. "Oh!" it ia
polite to exclaim In a tone of great
surprise, "I should have taken you" to
be forty at the very least." And the
other, even if a woman, will blush with
pleasure at the Insinuated flattery. The
respect which the Chinese pay to their
parents, and to old people generally, is
one of the things in which they differ
with advantage from ourselves. Chi
nese children have not to be reminded
-that a parent is, after all, one of God's
creatures. The Chinese never speak
of old fogies, or make parents feel that
they have over stayed their welcome In
the world. In speaking to. a parent a
child is taught to avoid all reference to
old age, and every* boy 'has held up to
him as an exampje the conduct of Laon
And if old age is pleasant to himself,
and if he is at all worthy (as he de
sires to be) of the name of sise, which
his friends are wont to give aim. It is
because he has always obeyed the laws
of nature, and submitted to her guid
ance as to that of a god. It is not
likely that she, who has brought U3
well through all the stages of life,
should, like an indolent poet, fail in
the last act. All things must have
an end, and for man to be dissatisfied

was runnins over the catalogue of her
ailments, her physician at last said to
her, "What would you have, madam?
I cannot make you young # agaln!" Or
dinary practitioners cannot do this, but
there are four famous doctors who, if
they cannot make us young can give
us an old age not frosty but kindly.
Their names are Temperance, Exercise.
Good Air and Early Hours, ilany peo
ple do not believe in these physicians,
because they are cheap, unaffected and
truthful; but when they are obeyed old
age stays away far longer, and when
It does come It is far less burdensome.
In Cicero's famous discourse on old
age the dialogue opens with the request
which a young man makes to Cato to
tell him how it is that he finds old age
so pleasant while to other men it is a
burden. He first answers, generally,
that If. is true that to many old men
age is a wretched condition, and one
which is deservedly contemptible as
well as wretched? And he gives in
stances both from hi3tory and - from
his own observation of living men â but
he says that this is not the fault or de
fect of nature, but of the men them
selves.

young, not unnaturally, keep away.
Querulousness .and pessimism should
always be fought against. The old have
had their good things, and Instead of
expecting much now they should be
ready to jump for joy If nothing alls
them. The way to grow old wisely is
the way of self-control, the way of
sympathy and the way of unselfishness.
The grand essentials of happiness In
every stage of life, but particularly in
the last, are having something to do,
something to love and something ta
hope for.
Let those love now who never loved before.
Let those who always loved now love the more.
If we cannot help growing old in
years, at least we can all try to grow
old gracefully. "Do you think I'm a
fool, sir?" thundered a fiery Scotch
laird to his new footman. "Weel, sir."
replied the canny Scot, "I'm not Ions
here and cannot ken, yet.". If we oughÂ»
not to call a man happy till he dies, it
is equally premature to call him wi3e
till we see how he manages his old age.
One is not growing old gracefully who
becomes slovenly in dress, acquires odd
tricks, makes disagreeable noises,
praises and thinks of nothing but the
Most of us, however, would prefer a
short period of waiting, as did one of
the captains of Charles V of Spain.
When old and infirm he asked the Em
peror to discharge him from public ser
vice because "there ought to be a pause
between the tumult of life and the day
of death." The best thing is neither to
love our lives nor to hate them, but to
live what we live well and not be anx
ious either way as to their duration.
We know several old people who are
quite willing to leave life, but who are
contented to wait as long as they are
of any use. And they are of use. They
sympathize with and give the benent
of their expeiience to the young, and
they teach to all a lesson of cheerful
resignation. After the day is over the
sun seems sometimes to hang for half
an hour in the horizon, as if to show
how glorious It can be. So God lets
some people, when their duty in this
world is done, hang in the West, so to
speak, that men may look upon them
and see how beautiful Is the ending of
a well-spent life. A friend told the
writer recently that the last days on
earth of his aged father quite aston
ished him, so happily and peacefully
were they spent. Having made his will
and arranged all his business he said,
"I am just waiting," with as much sat
isfaction as a schoolboy says, "I am
going home." This reminds us of some
word3 of the authores3 of "Uncle Tom's
Cabin," quoted in her biography: "I
feel about all things now as I do about
the things that happen in a hotel after
my trunk is packed to go home. I may
be vexed and annoyed, but what of it!
I am goinc home soon." "
When asked what age he was a man
answered "The right side of eighty."
"I thought you were' more than
eighty?" said the inquirer. "Yes: I
am beyond it," he replied, "and that
is the right side, for I am nearer my
eternal rest."

GRACEFUL OLD AGE
But we need not elaborate a proof
that the sunny days of youth are the
best days, or that the vigor and
strenuousness of young men /are most
valuable, because no one denies these
things. What some will think much
harder to prove is that there is a
beauty and a happiness in old age if
it be taken in the right way. When
Boswell expressed to Dr. Johnson a
wish to experience old age, the doctor
v.-.-<s much irritated and thundered out:
"What, would you have decrepitude?"
Whether we wish it or not, if we do
uot die young, we shall have the ex
perience of old age, but it depend3
very much upon the way in which we
spend the beginning and middle of our
live whether old age is, or is not, in
our case accompanied by decrepitude.
The poet Rogers, who was often com
plimented on being a fine old man,
used acidly to reply: "There is no such
thing, sir, as a fine old man." Well,
but to say the least, there are others,
and It Is the" duty of every one to try
and grow old gracefully. To grow old
is natural; being natural it is -beau
tiful, and if we grumble at it we miss
the lesson it would teach. When peo
ple asked Leontinus, the teacher of
Isocrates, who reached the age of 107,
Carlyle wrote that youths should be
ihxit up in barrels until they passed
their twenty-fifth year, because that is
the time when they attain their "max
imum of detestability." In the Senate
or council of the aged, young members
were occasionally saen, but they were
not heard unless they could make a
defense for the crime of being a young
man like the one so well known to have
been made by the younger Pitt. In thi
mrr.y promotion used to be by senior
ity, and ol'd men who had lo-st air nerve
and initiative commanded regiments.
Now, young men are coming to the
front. I heard it said lately by an ex
perienced officer that a man had not
nerve to properly lead a cavalry regi
ment after forty-five years of age.
Upon the EpiFcopal bench at present
there are those who would once have
been thought boy bishops. Most peo
ple of our day and generation admire
and envy youth. If to be young is a
fault it is one which we would all like
to commit. "What wpuld you give for
my youth?" a young fop asked Talley
rand. The wrinkled old diplomatist
smiled and replied, "My faith, I would
almost be willing to be as foolish!"
Thwe of us who are beginning to feel
s-yinptoms of that incurable disease, old
age, would make the same sacrifice.
Bow to tlie Inevitable.
SOME time ago it was the fash
ion to ?nub youth, and make
it take a very back seat in
deed. It was only admired in
ladies; men had to apologize for it as
if it were a crime. They ctmld not help
being born young, and in this way were
like Boswell. who pleaded toleration
from Dr. Johnson for his Scotch ex
traction on the ground that it was not
his fault that he was born a Scotch
man.

The game was suggested to Dr. Voor

gymnasium. A class of freshmen, with
wands In hand ready to fall Into drill,
caught sight of a rubber tire that had
fallen from an iron dumbbell on
the floor. The boys began driving the
ring about the room, and as Dr. Voor
hees watched them he saw the possibil
ity of a new game based on the general
principles of field hockey, changed to
suit the limited space of a gymnasium.
He figured out a ring of flexible rub
ber, five Inches in diameter, with a
three-inch opening through the center
with beveled sides, and a stick with a
convex end that would prevent the
ring from being lifted from the floor.
He then worked out a set of rules andâ

"The game has a special value In
educational training, a thing that la
lacking in basket ball. It develops
rapid reaction, skillful movement, ac
curacy and judgment. It takes judg
ment to gauge the rapidity with which
the ring travels and' accuracy as well
as good control of the muscles to put
the stick Into the three-Inch hole to
send the ring along.
"Ring hockey is equally.well adapt
ed to women and men. It Is now be

pect It to be popular In the Young
Men's Christian Association gymnasi

disfavor because professionals have
worked themselves in on the teams.
Ring hockey is essentially an amateur
game, for it lacks the sensational fea
tures that attract professionals.

Teams for match games are com
posed of six players, and the line-up
is similar to that for field hockey. The
field is divided into four equal parts
by the center line, and two quarter
lines. As it is an indoor game girls
have gone back to bloomers, which

The ring is put into play from the

with the ring between them, their
sticks near the outer edjje of the
ring, waiting for the referee's com

Twelve pairs of eyes are fixed on the
rubber ring, twelve pairs of hands

twelve pairs of feet limber themselves,

The ring shoots across the floor in
the direction of one of the goals, with
ten girls in hot pursuit. The two goal

on driving the ring, with five girls on
the other side trying to prevent it.
The game is on.

not left unrelated because tha Joke
was upon the narrator. Mrs. Fremont
was fond of gardening and the Gen

who understood his trade, but" who
was exceedingly ayerse. to receiving
orders from a woman. His peculiari
ties were overlooked as much aa pos

flatly and Insolently refused to execute
an order given by Mrs. Fremont. It
was Impossible to condone such de
liberate Insubordination, and the man
was discharged on the spot and di

for his pay. Arrived at his destina

For that which followed let no man

that Is the best type of manhood and

At.the close of the Revolutionary
War the eristsnee of slavery was de
fended in the South on economic
rather thin on moral grounds. Slaver
holding abolitionists were not un
common, and Washington and Jef
ferson left on .record as strong: denun
ciations of slavery as were "ever
penned by Garrison. But as the area
and the prefits of cotton culture and
the facilities cf intercommunication In
creased, so did the necessity for the
protection of slave property, and slav
ery became aggressive by that very
necessity of its nature which demanded
expansion as a cc-r.dition precedent of
continue-S existence. Where it ceased
to grow it began to die. It refused to
believe that the world was weary of it.
It refused to appreciate the fact that
the morel sense of the North, no longer
deadened by the opiate of profit, was
intolerant of further alliance with it.
It refused to- understand that agitation
for Its present restriction and ultimate
abolition could ho more be suppressed
than could the waves be stopped from
dashing: when the storm kins rides the
seas, or the earth be stopped from quiv
ering when internal fires throb, in her
furnaces. Unmindful or disregardful
of the fact that the dormant and
drowsy hostility of the North to slav
ery was sleeping but not dead, the
slaveholders rudely awakened it by re

PARIS, March 19. â An editorial has
drawn attention to French chemists
mistaking English and American pre
scriptions and substituting grams
for grains with ->rrible results in cases
where -belladonna, strychnine,,, etc., are
used. M Â¦ letters here appeared in
the newspapers as a result of the cor

LONDON. March 19:â The British
House of Commons no longer is what
it used to be. In many respects it
has fallen upon evil times. Once it
was "the best club in Europe." Now
adays it is "a collection of nobodies."
There wa^ a time when oratory was
an art cultivated ( there. At the pres
ent day not even the conversational
method of debate is held In honor, and
members make long, tedious speeches,
which : are intended, not so much - for
the ear of the House of Commons as
to meet the eye of the electors of
Mudhampton ;in. ( the columns" of their
locul newspaper. All this and much
more to the same effect is what one
hears In : parliamentary London at
every turn. Nobody treats the jere
miads seriously.

The widening of London bridge, the
$500,000 contract for which was be
gun two years ago, is about completed.
The improved bridge is eleven and
one-half feet wider than the old one.
Eight people will be able to walk
abreast on the path and the roadway
will accommodate four lines of traffic.
The second scheme Is for a similar
line, costing $125,000 a mile, from the
houses ' of Parliament to Putney
bridge, along t'.-.e Chelsea embank
ment.
The schemes were laid before the
traffic commission this week. The
first consists of a twelve-mile overhead
line, costing $500,000 per mile, from
the Royal Oak to the Albert and Vic
toria docks, via Camden town, with
branch lines to Willesden, Stepney and
Limehouse.
LONDON, March 19. â London is
offered monorails as a solution of the
traffic problem. Two schemes, each
costing over $10,000,000. have been
prepared by F. B. Berhe, inventor of
the monorail system, which it is pro
posed to construct between Manches

About that time the Mikado hap
pened to be in great need of a man
who could interpret English for him
and somebody thought of Hayashi.
The condemned rebel was taken from
his cage and performed the task so
well that the Mikado pardoned him and
made him imperial interpreter. At
that time there were only five or six
Japanese who could speak English.
The revolt was put down and the
revolutionists, Hayashi and the rest
were turned over to the "lord high
executioner," who put them in iron
cages until he got ready to cut their
heads off.
LONDON, March 19.â Viscount
Hayashi, the Japanese Minister to
Great Britain, spent several years at
the University of London and returned
to his own country in time to take

The -piano instantly struck up in a
very lively fashion a scherzo by
Chopin. The woman had nothing to

merely rested on the keyboard.
MOSCOW, March 19. â Two Spirit
ualists named Bitroff and Speranska.
both mediums, gave a seance here at
which were present a. number of peo
ple, who say these thing3 happened:
Soon after a circle was formed the
table began to tip and its edges glowed
with a strange light.
Presently Mr. Bitroff went into a
trance, stood up, took Mr. Speranska
by the hand, and led him to a por
trait of Chopin, the famous composer
of music. Suddenly the same light,
something like an electric glow, illu
mined the picture for a moment.
Mr. Speranska asked a woman pres
ent to place a hand on the piano. She
,did so.
Then he put one of his hands on her
head and the other, on the portrait,
whereupon the light shone out of the
portrait.

WORK OF MEDIUM AWES
ASSEMBLAGE AT MOSCOW
Â¦ BERLIN, March 19.â At a recent
meeting of the Berlin section of the
German Merchants' League, in which
the dressmaking and dry goods trades
were .most strongly represented: the
possibility of a distinctive German
style' was discussed. A committee was
appointed which will report its find
ings to the next meeting. .
â¢ An authority upon UÂ»e drapery
trades, whose opinion was yesterday
invited, laughed openly at the idea
of German fashions. The strength of
Germany, he said, lay in the direction
of- workmanship and adaptability. In
any attempt to invent fashions of her
own she would be doomed to failure.
Â¦Â¦, France was not only artistic, he said,
but its capital was the fashionable
metropolis of the world. The result
was, that ,the designing of the decora
tive side of the drapery "trades lies in
French hands; the light goods which
are most easily changed by fashion are
French In design,\ though sometimes
they are made in Germany.
The only claim which Germany pos
sesses'to be. considered a fashion-mak
er Is summed up as follows: If one
of these' designs is successful it is
copied more cheaply in the East End
of London. The German, however,
cannot complain, for the original de
sign is not really his. , ,.

Flammarion, the astronomer, has

Jasper was deluded.
' PARIS, March 19. â Three learned
men of Europe now range themselves
on the side of "Brother" Jasper, the
negro preacher who died in Rich
mond, Va., still declaring "The sun
do move." When Pasquier and
Flamache, two Belgian scientists; re
cently asserted that there never had
been absolute proof of Galileo's say
ing. "The earth moves," the laughter
in France Was as the laughter in
America at Rev. Mr. Jasper.
Now no less a personage than M.
Poincare, president of the Astronomi
cal Society of France, takes sides with
the Belgian deniers of astronomical
orthodoxy. The matter now takes on
a more serious aspect. Solemn dis
cussers of grave subjects have taken
this up to see whether accepted no
tions on the motion of the earth are
visionary.

Asked why the beauty doctor should
flourish so at present, a specialist said
to me, "Society life kills beauty more
quickly than the ravages of sickness.
The increased number of London func
tions necessitating late hours, the phy
sical exertions of dancing parties and
the sudden change of temperature from
a hot room to a' foggy London street
late at night, cause a young society
woman's beauty to fade before it has
had time to reach its natural stage of
development and their only alternative
is to appeal to the specialist or look pre
maturely old." Without artificial aid it
is said that the society girl who "goes
the pace" could not retain her beauty
for more than two seasons. For this
reason some of the more sensible moth
ers refuse to "present" their daughters
until they have reached rather mature
years, because immediately a girl is
"presented" she is expected to be seen
forthwith at all important functions.
In the case of older women, .wrinkles
have to be removed, dimples have to be
preserved and the eyebrows have to be
kept beautiful by a regular application
of oxide of mercury and lard. The pro
cess of fixing false eyelashes is one of
the most difficult and delicate of the
specialist's operations. The hair has to
be threaded through the eyelid with a
fine needle. The job when properly
done is worth $150. Most of the spe
cialists at present operating in London
are of continental origin, the elite of
the profession coming from Paris.
What is known as the London season
is their harvest and when things slow
down the smaller fry do a bit at clair
voyance, assuming a different name
and a different establishment.
It is not generally kndwn that the

This patronage of her Majes'ty has
had a stimulating effect on the work
of the beauty doctors with the result
that Bond street and its adjacent busi
ness thoroughfares are now â¢ honey
combed with establishments where
youth and, beauty are guaranteed to be
maintained for an Indefinite period at
a fixed price. It is considered that $500
a year is a moderate sum for a society
beauty to pay in order to have her face,
neck and shoulders occasionally
treated.

beauty of Queen Alexandra is not alto

The Countess, who, before her marriage,
was Miss Blanche Adeliza Fitzroy, the
prily daughter of a Northamptonshire
squire, owes her stockbrokers alone al
most $30,000. Her losses were incurred
for the most part on the London Ex

Probably Lord Rosslyn. who acted in
the United States under his stage nama
of James Erskine and who was the cor
respondent of a London newspaper
through the South African war, now
regrets more than ever that his famous
"system" for breaking the bank at
Monte Carlo proved such a dismal fail
ure. For, were his Lordship's finances
in as flourishing a condition as he
hoped they would be by this time, he
would be able to give his distinguished
mother a hand in her present business
difficulties.
ROSSLYN'S MISFORTUNES.
The co-operation of . the Duchess of
Marlborough, Viscountess Deerhurst
and a few other American ladies have
changed all this and the society is now
in a position to do good practical work.
The Duchess of Marlborough has al
ways helped with her purse, but now
both she and Viscountess Deerhurst
take a personal interest in all its work
âthey attend meetings of the commit
tee, offer suggestions' and receive mis
sion ladies attached to churches and
schools, and they express the greatest
delight when they learn that some suf
fering is alleviated or a si3ter rescued
from a life of moral danger. It is most
ly through the influence of Lady Henry
Somerset that the Duchess of Marl
borough has been led to take such an
active interest in the work of the
society.
est in the work of English society ladies
who like to be described as social re
formers. The National Union of Women
Workers, the organization with which
the Duchess is chiefly identified just
now, is not a trade union, as its name
would suggest, but an institution sup
ported by such women as Lady Henry
Somerset, the Countess of Warwick,
Lady Dilke and a number of other well
known society ladies, for the purpose
of encouraging and improving the con
ditions under which all classes of
women live and especially to raise them
morally and socially. The organization
has been working quietly, for the last
three years very little being heard of it
because its financial condition was not
particularly healthy.
During the first empire, when Napo
leon's admirers expected he would com
plete the- conquest- of. Europe, the
dresses of the ladies of the court often
were braided in hussar fashion. It
would appear that the fashion is about
to be revived in a modified form. Gold
braid and gilt buttons are seen on all
sides' and- occasionally epaulettes.
Should these come in seriously .as a
fashion the sloping shoulder will dis
appear and slender waists once more
be essenial.
A New York dressmaker, now In
Paris, in an interview asserts the ne
cessity of copying Parisian models, but
says modifications are necessary be
cause Americans want dresses closely
fitting. The competition Is less keen
here than In America, Paris houses
having different specialties. He_claims
the " Americans* are the best dressed
women In the world,' but admits that
the Perislennes are. more careful in re
gard to corsets than Americans.
Recent attempt to dethrone the gold
chain purses from the position they
occupy in a smart woman's outfit seem
to have failed, for they are seen as
much as ever in the Rue de Paix. The
latest form, however, is curious. This
is a mascot purse, thoroughly Parisian;
It is shaped, like a little pig and can
be carried easily in the hand. It will
hold. 500 or 600 francs in gold.
PARIS. March 19.â Whether owing to
a press campaign or a desire for novel
ty,, quite a revolution has taken, place

That is the conclusion to which
Marcel Prevost cornea in discussing
the causes of the war in the Far East.
He argues that the diplomats on both
sides would have averted hostilities,
but that the working classes in Japan,
enraged because the price of rice has
doubled, sought an outlet for their
fury.
"Useless," he holds, "are courts of
arbitration and shepherds inclined to
ward peace, if their flocks are as
ravening wolves.... The_.jcxjm.njoi> man

AMERICANS AGGRIEVED.
The "tale," mentioned above, is al
ways prefaced with an "I am told," and
has not yet left the region of "on dits,"
but there seems to be no doubt that this
visit of the King and Queen to the
academy has caused considerable
heartburn in the American colony, es
pecially among the ladies, each of
whom considered that she had a special
and peculiar claim to be present, while
in reality only Mrs. Meyer, the Embas
sador's wife, and Mrs. Mowbray, the
wife of the director, were Viere, with
the avowed idea of not offending any
one by picking and choosing. Thus the
residents feel hurt, but the traveling
American is positively enraged, as the
accepted idea is that all the American
officials are here to cater to their
amusement and comfort, and that they
should not introduce them to their
Majesties when at an American insti
tute is an unimaginable affront. As
there are now perhaps 5000 Americans
passing through the city, and as no lady
can be asked to meet the Queen who
has not been presented, such claims
have to be ignored.
The academy is now. for the moment,
without a director, as Mr. Mowbray has
just left for America, and a new one
has not yet been i appointed. The de
parture of Mr. ' Mowbray has caused
much regret in the colony, as both he
and his wife were immensely popular
and did everything possible, not only
for the students, but for strangers who
called upon them, putting themselves
to considerable trouble that their
compatriots might see the famous
"Aurora."
institution here of any kind has been
opened by the sovereign.
The King, it must be confessed. Is not
an art connoisseur, but the Queen loves
and knows good work when. she sees
it, eo that Ehe lingered long by those
of the exhibits which touched her
fancy, and which were, in fact, the
best. There were sixty paintings, chief
among them being the reproduction of
the Pinturicchios of the Sala Borgia, by
the temporary director, Mr. Mowbray,
for the ceiling of the library of the
University Club of New Tork, and a
decorative panel of the "Three Fates,"
by A. Swartz of Louisville, Ky., holder
of the Lazarus prize; twenty-four
architectural drawings, the finest being
a production of the ceiling of the fa
mous Massimo palace, now inhabited
by the American Princess Brancaccio
(nee Field), by J. W. Hoover; and six
pieces of sculpture, the greater part
from the hand of Charles Keck of New
York, who holds the RInehart prize of
Baltimore. The King paused long be
fore the circular relief of "Achilles
Mourning Patronens," admiring partic
ularly the figure of the great Greek
warrior.
The students in the academy take a
cc-irse cf study of three years, more
with the aim to school the taste and
Â¦ observe than to produce original work,
the course being entirely for post
graduates, that is, crtists who- are al
ready such ard know the fundamentals
cf their craft. This year, for the first
time, the academy may be said to have
received official recognition from the
authorities here, under the guidance
, of H. Siddons Mowbray, the well known
"New York artist.

such credit to America that Embassa

the opening. His Majesty not only
accepted the invitation promptly, but
her Majesty was also present. This, of
course, means little to good republi
cans, but in Home, the home of the
academy, it meant much â recognition
by the head of the state, a high com
pliment to America and the American
colony here (thereby hangs a tale), and
the placing of the academy on an
equcllty with the other foreign art
institutes. The occasion was also an
important erne, for the reason that it

During the week of the session of the
Grand Commandery, Knights Templar,
in this city California Commandery No.
1, agreeable to a time-honored custom,
will tender a reception to Eminent Sir
Thomas H. Browne, its commander, in
the Mechanics' Pavilion on the evening
of April 2L This gathering of the
mother commandery in California,
â¢which numbers more than 600 sir
knights, will be In keeping with the
brilliant events of the past with which
this organization has been so promi
nently identified. There will be a spe
cial significance to the coming recep
tion, as It will be the first time in the
history of the commandery that one so
young in years as the present com
mander becomes the recipient of such
a distinguished honor. No commander,
notwithstanding his age, has since the
commandery has been in existence
achieved such phenomenal success as
has attended his administration, and
those who have watched his course as
sert that it is doubtful if his record
can be duplicated in any of the com
manderies of the United States. The
fact that this Is the Triennial Conclave
year and that the Grand Encampment,
the law-making: bodv of the Templar
organizations of the world, will hold its
session In this city next September,
from the Cth to the 10th, has had much
to do with Inspiring a large number of
young men to seek the honors of
knighthood. Aside from this the com
mander's pleasing personality has
drawn many young men from the Ma
sonic ranks to California Commandery.
This spirit finds expression among the
older members, who have marveled at
the commander's strenuous administra
tion, which has kept them keyed up to
tonrert pitch during the current Tem
plar year. The older members will join
with the younger ones in honoring the
commander in a manner that none of
his predecessors have before been hon
ored. There will be a review of the en
tire commandery in full uniform by the
eminent commander and an exhibition
drill by its famous drill corps, under
command of R. P. Hurlbut, past com
mander of the commandery, who led
the same drill corps to victory at Louis
ville in 190L There will also be a select
programme of vocal and instrumental
music, to be followed by dancing. It is
expected that about S000 people will be
in attendance at this function.
On the second Monday in March the

each of the grand officers was pre
sented with a bunch of La France
roses and bouquets of violets and
Jonquils were presented to prominent
members of the order who were pres
ent as visitors. Six candidates were
admitted by initiation, after which,
speeches by the grand officers were in
order. The grand arch Druidess of
fered a number of suggestions for the
good of the circle and also offered
others which undoubtedly the delegates
to the next Grand Circle will consider.

era-house, Mary Mannering in "Har
riet's Honeymoon" at the Columbia
and "Mr. Pickwick" at the Tivoli, not
to speak of the Alcazar's "Parsifal" â
we may be pardoned a temporary
vanity. It is better to be vain a little
than be humble s'much.
Most notable will be the Fiske en
gagement at the Grand that will last
for four weeks. During the time Mrs.
Fiske will present a number of new
plays, the first the famous "Mary of
Magdala." With Mrs. Fiske comes an
excellent company, including Max Fig
man, Hobart Bosworth, Frank Gill
more, W. B. Mack, Sydney Smith, E.
C. Wilbur. Henry Haskins, Emily
Stevens, Mary Maddern, Belle Bohn
and many others of less note-. The
productions will be like the original
Xew York issues, that of "Mary* of
Magdala" being one of the most su
perbly handsome and historically cor
rect ever seen on the stage.
Paul Heyse is the author of the
drama in which Mrs. Fiske and her
company make their fir3t appearance,
and William Winter, the translator of
the German dramatist's noble work.
The translation Is said to be a re
markable one, notable for distinguished
beauty of language and close sympa
thy with the original. It is In blank
verse. Dramatically the play seems
to have a profound impression. His
tory rather than the Bible has been
the fountain from which its materials
are drawn, though most of the charac
ters and much of the incident are bib
lical.
In Us effect the play has been re
markably compelling upon all manner
of critics. The ministry and laymen
alike have combined to praise, the pro
fessional critic succumbed to Its spir
itual spell. The theme, of course, Is
the conversion of Mary Magdalen.' In
the play Judas is her lover, and in th3
original it is suggested that Jealousy
of the Christ's power over her rather
than avarice temnts Judas to betray
his Master. Mr. Winter eliminates this
suggestion, however. The first act finds
Mary In her palace in Jerusalem, sur
rounded by her lovers and all the
splendors of her shame. It closes with
her hearing, - strangely moved, of the
coming of Christ to Jerusalem.

three openings of the kind that we are

AT LOCAL THEATERS
FOR COMING WEEK
He finally revolted and destroyed the
pewer of the Glinskls and the Shuiskis,
and founded the Oprichniks. a body
of men organized by Ivan for his own
special service. Hereafter Ivan ruled
with an iron hand. Ivan" died in 15S4.
Concerning the events dealt with in
the tragedy of Ivan's death and the ap
pearance of Ivan at that time the fol
lowing may be of interest:
"Ivan, in gloomy despair, summoned
a council, declared that he wished to
enter a monastery! and .ordered them
to proceed to the -choice of another
Tzar. Yielding, however, to the re
peated prayers of the Boyars. he con
sented to remain upon the throne.
"Losing his possessions "one after an
other, threatened on every side by ene
mies, Ivan was cruelly stricken; h!3
tortured feelings were reflected in his
manner and in his exterior. He had
become careless in dress, his lofty stat
ure was bent, his eyes Ijad grown dim.
his lower jaw dropped as in advanced
age and only In the presence of others
did he constrain himself, stand proudly
erect -and look with suspicion on those
around him to- find if any man noted
the decline of his spirits. In those mo
ments he was still more terrible than
in theÂ«days of his grandeur. Xever be
fore had Moscow been under such pres
sure of despondency and fear."
The historian states elsewhere that
"Ivan's face had grown greatly old, th*Â»
furrows had sunk deeper, on his head
there remained but little hair, his beard
had fallen out altogether."
The statues and pictures of Ivan, de
picting him at his death hour with a
beard and long hair, are therefore In
correct.
Boris Fyodorvich (Godunoff) at this
period had risen with rapidity. Ha
was the brother-in-law of the Tzare
vitch, whom his sister Irina had mar
ried. It is recounted that Ivan, wishing
tn show how near Godunoff and his
daughter-in-law were to his heart,
raised three fingers, and counting them
with the other hand, said: "This ;s
Fyodor (his son), this is Irina, this Is
Boris, and as it would be equally pain
ful to my hand whichever of three
fingers were cut off, so would it b*
grievous to my heart to lose any one
of these beloved."
. Godunoff is described as "modest,
The evil spirit of the Shuiskis aroused
terrible hatred in Ivan, and he later
paid his enemies in kind and with over
flowing measure. Ivan, who had sought
everywhere in books for reasons to
strengthen his position, resolved with
all the vividness of his boyish enthu
siasm to become in Moscow what David
and Solomon had been in Jerusalem,
what Augustus had been in Rome and
the first Christian Emperor in Con
stantinople.
"The Terrible," and the rise to power
of Boris Godunoff.
The interest of the tragedy may be
said to be fairly divided between the
Tzar Ivan and Boris Godunoff. In order
to comprehend the remarkable char
acter of Ivan, it must be remembered
that in his boyhood he was neglected,
maltreated and even insulted by the
Shulskis, who directed and controlled
the oligarchs.
Men to whom Ivan showed attach
ment were Imprisoned or put to death,
and he lived, as it were, alone in the
palace, neglected and harassed. The
plan was to stunt his intellectual
growth to such a degree that he would
be incapable of rule.
Meanwhile the boy, impressionable
and passionate, had great natural gifts ;
he read all the books that were acces
sible â the Bible, * "Sacred History,"
"Fathers of the Church," "Russian
Chronicles" and "The History of the
Roman Empire, Eastern and Western."
Ivan was self-educated.
The Shuiskis, who hesitated at noth
ing in seizing power and holding it.
began by poisoning Ivan's mother.
Having gained possession of the boy,
they did everything to. deform him
morally. Ivan himself has le^t a vivid
picture of what he endured in child
hood.
And then, in the hush and profound
dark of the theater, with its one pale
light above the white bier of Titurel,
set weirdly In the center of the stage,
I came silently away.

Mrs. Blanchard's recital for Tuesday

one. This most artistic among local

ably spent. Here are Mrs. Blanchard's
songs, and tickets may be obtained for

anything else, with Its slightly aquiline
nose, black brows and interrupted oval.
It was a good American glance she
gave me now as she said: "My mother
sent this to me"â the Cleopatra glitter
and film of the temptation scene â
"she had to go to New York because
my father was ill. We had both looked
forward so to her seeing the first night
of 'Parsifal' â I'm so disappointed. You
don't know, of course, but my mother
takes such interest in my workâmoth
ers do, you know" â I knew â "that it
seems as though half the fun had gone
out of things when she is not here."
"I'm afraid you're spoiled."
t "I'm afraid I am." Miss Block's eyes
curled up Japanesely. "Mother is re
sponsible for anything 1 I have done,
though she did once â "
"Object to your being an actress." I
hazarded.
"Worse." Miss Block laughed. Her
sensitively skinned lips show very pret
ty teeth, by the way. "Much worse.
Mother wanted to make me into a
musician. Six years I studied at the
Xew England Conservatory, and I can't
play a note! When you don't want to
do a thing you know how much you
don't want to do it. And how I hated
it!"
The actress' piano-punching must
have been pretty vigorous by the way
in which she wielded the powder puff
here. She concluded comically, "Moth
er's sorry she bothered me now."
Mother's practical repentance "was
before me in the gown that the maid
was still holding up before me. "And
she sent you this?" I said.
"Yes. You see, I couldn't get Just
the color I wanted here. I wanted a
pale gold, not yellow, you know." An
artist's distinction, look you.
Miss Block's throat again claimed at
tention here, and she said: "It will
be all right in a day or two; but just
think of the rehearsals and you won't
wonder. We rehearsed all night Sun
day until 7 o'clock on Monday morn
ing. It was the same on Friday night,
and there were three- other rehearsals
besides the private study."
I stopped a second to wonder what
the actress* neighbors must have
thought if she practiced Kundry's cries
at home belore asking: "Do you mean
to say that you had only five rehear
sals for 'Parsifal'?"
"That's all," she replied. "Don't you
think it is pretty good work for the
time, and getting ready 'Miss Hobbes*
and 'White Horse Tavern,' by the
way?"
I did.
"And Mr. Belasco only saw the pro
duction once in Xew York, and pro
duced it here from that."
I acknowledged that also to be won
derful, then said: "You people must
have been very tired Monday night? "
"Oh, yes, and nervous! I was never
more nervous for a Xew York first
night. Somehow everything seemed S3
important. And, of course, one couldn't
sleep in the daytime."
"You don't look as though you had
lost much" â and then with my best
Sherlock Holmes manner I said: "I
should really have thought you would
be too tired to-day to go automobiling
at 11."
She looked flatteringly surprised and
demanded, "How did you know?"
I told her that she had herself told
me through Mr. Price, when I had sug
gested the interview for earlier in the
day. To confess she had set it for 10
and I had balked.
Then Miss Block, through intervals
of curving her black hair gracefully
about her pretty head, sent Kundry
again automobiling into space. Siie
loved it â next to horseback riding. But
she was fickle! It was like sailing on
velvet. She had been out from 11 o'clock
until 5:30. Wasn't it jolly? They ha<l
taken luncheon. Surely that was bet
terâthe fresh airâ than resting in bed?
Yes, she always went to sleep as soon
as her head touched the pillow. And
she always tried to be In bed by 12:S0.
One couldn't stand * suppers after the
play and work and keep well. Did I
think so?
I said then point blank that I should
like to know what Miss Block thought
of Kundry's significance. But I really
didn't care. She was EymphonJcally
pretty to look at whether she talked
kfttens or Kundry.
She preferred not to discuss the char
acter. She looked a little puzzled and
distressed at the suggestion. "We have,
you see"â with a line of trouble on her
delicate browâ "so little time to pre
pare anything. I do what Mr. Murphy
told me to do and that is the sum of
it I haven't had time to read about
or discuss the character with any one.
I should, of course. like to have done
bo. Mr. Murphy told me the character
was a composite .of three women â I
even forget who. And I can't talk
about it. I'm really rather afraid of
interviews. Things look so different in
print I can only feel things â can't say
them. You'll forgive me?"
I shrived her then and there and
wondered at the mime wonderful,
who can look a Magdalen and a
Cleopatra at another's will.
"They took everything beautifully
last night, didn't they? iliss Block
pursued. "To-night they seemed In
clined to laugh occasionally." And
that was the end of Kundry.
"Are you a Xew YorkÂ«r?" I asked
then, remembering her mention of
Xew York.
"Xo, from Boston," the actress sup
plied, "but I studied for the stage in
Xew York â played there, too."
"You were with Mr. Sothern?"
"For a year in 'The King's Mus
keteer* â how nice Mrs. Sothern Is!"
she broke off, "not a whit different
now ehe is a star than before her star
days. They're both charming. I was
with Miss Crosman â do you know?
for two years."
"That must have been interesting,"
I say, and I ask, "in what?"
" 'As You Like It,' " Miss Block sup
plied; "I was Celia. "Oh, you know,
I am taller than MJss Crosman and
we had to change the lines, 'the taller
of the two* to 'the darker of the two.'
Editing Shakespeare !'\
"You played Celia jHth dark hair?"
"And Miss Crosman with blonde,"
the actress nodded. "Really, I ex
pected to play Olivia to her Viola.
Wanted to. But it fell out that I had
to play Celia, I -played it for two
years. She â Miss Crosmanâ is charm-
Miss Adole Block's Kundry of Mon
day r.i.ch: in the Alcazar "Parsifal" de
cided me that I should much like to
talk Kundry with Miss Block. Of all
the Wagner women the character is
most curiously interesting, and Miss
Block's is a. conception of the part that
much outranks anything the actress
has hitherto done, and is inherently of
remarkable variety and beauty. There
fore I thought I would get her "views"
â of course the had "em â for mine own
enlightenment and yours. Incidentally
I would take in a little more "Parsifal"
atmosphere from behind scenes and
rind if the player folk were as much
affected by the sacred story as their*
audience. So. by the courtesy of Mr.
Price. I found myself on the stage last
Tuesday evening at eight.
Miss Block was upstairs, and came
down in the terra -cotta complexion and
skins of the first act to tell me that
not until the second act's end should
ve have time to talk. Her make-up
in its integrity could be recommended
to any Aida. The actress has achieved
the fine burnt rose of Eaines' not-to
be-forgotten slave girl, from her cheeks
to her logical toes. Skins of fox and
leopard clothed her, and Miss Block's
handsome eyes shone out from under
the ratty locks of Kundry like sun
shot brown pools in a woodland thicket.
Very well, I would be there. It would
suit me better so, as I could absorb
Harold Bauer's Schumann Fantasie
in C in the meantime. I watched
awhile then, and it was like a bit of
Tennyson, with the yellow-haired, blue
garbed pages soberly fatting about;
bearded knights of the Grail solemnly
awaiting their cue; the venerable locks
of Gurnemanz, and Amfortas' sorrow
ful face, lifted against the forest back
ground of Montsalvat.
It seemed not such a far step to *the
Bach Italian concerto to which I soon
found myself listening. Nor did it
s* em out of pitch when I returned from
the land of Bauer's Schumannâ late,
mea culpa â to the impressive scene of
the return cf the Savior-knight.
Like the r^stâ Amfortas, the flower
c:rl5. rÂ£P?s, stage hands, I took the
nearest crack to watch the scene. It
is th^ most difficult of my acquaintance.
It is also the most daring. That it does
not offend, even where the Kundry
MagdaK-n washes the feet of the Parsi
falâChrist, is due entirely to the
simple sincerity and reverence of the
actors. One could wish a more sternly
ribered, less graceful â so to speak â
Parsifal than Mr. Durking in the
scene of the knight's overcoming by
.fatigue. One could hardly desire a
more notable grace and uplift of ex
pression than he has at some moments.
Miss Block throughout the - scene is
admirable. Xearness only lent new
conviction to the reverent wonder,
adoration, faith that her face ex
presses so eloquently. Orient eyes, a
cioud of midnight hair, a face Eastern
in all its suggestion, doubtless added,
for pictoriaily also Miss Block is the
ideal Magdalen. It took, indeed, all
my remembrance of her savage Kundry
to persuade me that I had a right to
tread the same boards with these!
Mr. Durkin's "Play ball, George," as
he came off with Mr. Osbourae, doubt
.lets relieved the strain, of things for
him as for me. It was solemnly enough
said, however. Titurel, under the black
velvet pall of the next scene, begging
that the bearers would not permit the
bier to wobble, also helped. But the
atmosphere soon closed in again and
came to a climax with the final picture
Â«'f the dove descending upon Parsifal's
head. Even the prediction from a
practical stage hand that it was going
to "hit him one" failed to cheer or the
lively bustle after the final curtain to
bring one quite to earth again.
I followed Miss Block to her dressing
room in expectantly exa'ted mood. We
should decide, perhaps, that the relig
ious Instinct imbedded, ingrained In
the fiber of us all, made a "Parsifal"
not unusually difficult, but unusually
easy of performance. We should set
tle Kundry's. complex hash, determine
the effect of such plays upon the pub
lic and actors, pass upon the compara
tive artistic moralities of a Tivoll
"Tannhauser" and an Alcazar "Parsi
fal"; decide why a Verdi may make a
"Traviata" from a "Camille" and a
Murphy may not. according to some
lights, make a "Parsifal" play from a
"Parsifal" music-drama, and other such
questions. "We didn't, however. This
is the history of how we didn't:
I think It was the clothes partly. As
Foon as we reached her dressing-room
Miss Block disappeared into the ward
robe to change her garb. I occupied
the interval in looking round at her
picture gallery; at the "Aim high and
believe yourself capable of great
things" motto that conspicuously
cdoraed her mirror; at thÂ» good wishes
for her first night at the Alcazar from
Henrietta Crosir.an. ditto, ditto; at the
canned eomplfcxions and usual profes
sional truck of the actress' workroom.
Miss Block was gone but a moment,
but there were 2)0 centuries between
the sad creature who left me and the
bright thing that returned. This was
a Mmr. Butterfly, whose white arms
rhone from a cherry and azure flow
ered kimona, whose long black locks
vere twisted carelessly above smiling
Japanese eyes. She sat down in front
of the mirror to remove her makeup,
and suddenly Kundry seemed millions
cf miles away.
With a little cough Miss Block be
gan: "Those shrieks are very hard on
one's throat â I'm afraid Wagner is
ruining my voice!"
"What must it be for Ternina, and I
h.ear Gadski is going to sing Kundry?"
I suggest.
"Don't know, I'm sure." Miss Block
returns; "it has made my throat quite
tore."
I to!d hpr then cf one place at least
where I thought the shrieks could be
rut to advantage, and then we began
to talkâ deplorably feminine â of the
.Kundry wardrobe. Meantime Mis.s
Clock was wiping off on the towel the
last remnant of suggestion of the Mag

Apropos of genius, Mrs. Kate Upson
Clark, a Brooklyn exponent of art. ad
dressed an exclusive club in Chicago
on "The Relation Between Art and
Morals" last week, and tho following
excerpt from her dissertation brought
down wrathful torrents upon her blonce
head: ,Â¦
"The genius should not marry. A
woman wants her husbandâ not hia art.
Genius is Insanity. In order to dp
genius it lives most of the time in a
world of deep emotions. It is hard for
people of artistic temperament to con
form to ordinary rules. Thus divorces,
suicides, drunkenness and impulsive
vices are found among people of genius.
The irrepressible temperament seems
to be absolutely necessary to art."
What would our local artists think
of this verdict of the fair Chicagoese?
And what would their wives thinkâ

being chased from the banks of the

ders. He has confessed to three.
Five years Naronovich killed pretty

because she refused to mjtrry him.
Her three brothers' vowed vengeance
and sent word to their tWo brothers in
this country that the murderer should
be hunted down. He was at work near
Bingham, Utah, when one of the
brothers came across him 'and notified
the- officers. It appears that Narono
vich, after killing his sweetheart, fled
to Chicago, where he committed two
other murders on December 20, 1903.
The victims were Rade Vldovich and
Tony Calovlc The murder occurred
at a dance in South Chicago. Narono
vich immediately returned to hia na
tive land and there killed Nicholas
Gagula, who had been his rival for the
affections of his girl victim. Then ha
came back toi this country, seeking the
West to hide his identity. But the
brothers of the girl pursued him and
yesterday one of them ran him down
near this city. The prisoner denies
that he killed Eva, declaring that she
cornmlited suicide. He admits, though,
that he murdered the menjn Chicago

But a willingness is also manifest to

WASHINGTON, March 19.â Fearins
the ascendency of the Hearst-Bryan
combination In the Democratic Na

might mean the loss of the State of
New York, the South haa started a
landslide for a conservative candidate.
This has been demonstrated by a can
vass of the majority of the Southern
States through their representatives
in Congress. In the Senate the senti
ment, in so far as it I3 for any par
ticular candidate, is for Senator Gor

far and away in the lead. The only
explanation given for the Parker boom
is the belief that New Tork will In

Southern Democrats are band wagon
statesmen. They want to be with the

The remarks of the Pope give ad
ditional certainty that M. Loubet will
not make a call at the Vatican during
his coming visit to Rome. The plans
for the Presidential trip are now prac
tically made up. They include a mil
itary review in Rome, a naval review
at Naples and a number of brilliant
logser functions, but there is no men
tion of the Vatican. This is being com
pared with Emperor William's con
spicuous attentions to the Vatican au
thorities during his visit to Rome and
his showy call on Pope Leo, escorted
by cuirassiers, on May 2, 1901
A prominent personage says Presi
dent Loubet will go to Rome more like
Charlemagne, a representative of au
thority instead of dependence. The
visit will also be notable in breaking
the long standing custom that the visit
of the ruler of a Catholic country to
Rome required a visit to the Vatican.
It Is a recognized fact among the dip
lomats that Emperor Francis Joseph
has not returned the visit of the King
of Italy because he would be expected
to call at the Vatican. The Kings of
Spain and Portugal have refrained
from going to Rome for similar rea
sons. M. Loubet's visit will emphasize
a departure from this accepted usage.
But the tension between France and
the Vatican promises to be offset by a
strengthening of the bonds between
France and Italy, particularly concern
ing the Mediterranean interests. The
visit will follow the conclusion of thÂ«
Franco-Italian arbitration treaty,
which is another link in the interna
tir nal understanding which France re
cently ha* been establishing.
The situation of Premier Combes'
Ministry Is gradually becoming preca
rious as a result of its recent parlia
mentary reverses. It is not considered
that an Imminent crisis will occur, but
even the best informed Government
quarters describe the Ministry as grad
ually crumbling away. The gradual
sapping of M. Combes' strength Is not
due to the pending law suppressing all
forms of congregational teaching, as
his majorities have been steadily main
tained on that question, but the diffi
culties are mainly due to socialist
measures for worklngmen's pensions
and employment agencies. There Is lit

.The admiral said he had no doubt
that it was feasible to construct * the
dam. On thequestion of a .sea-level
canal Admiral Walker declared posi
tively that in his opinion it never
would be necessary to .go -to the ex
pense of constructing such a canal.
A lock canal would do air the work
required and cost much less.
Representative; Harrison explained
to the committee the provisions of his
bill for the government' of -the canal
zone. This bill provides for ;& com
mission of twenty business men, the
engineering work to be supervised by
a corps of engineers.
The engineering .features of the
work were explained at some length,
as well as the Intense interest which
prospective contractors already are
taking in the matter. The admiral
said that on the steamer on which
the commission was to sail staterooms
had been engaged to the capacity of
the ship by the agents of prospective
contractors, who .wanted to look the
ground over. In' this connection he
advised that / no requirement of law
should make it necessary to do the
work by contract, as he believed con
tractors might combine to * the disad
vantage of : the Government. It was
the intention of the committee, he
said, to continue actual work on the
canal as now being carrled'on by the
French company in order to demon
strate the exact cost of such work.
The engineering feat of the whole en
terprise was expected to be the con
struction of the Bhio dam. ' It will be
necessary to go 120 feet below the sea
level to get the proper foundation for
the dam. Although there have, been
many borings for rock bottom, Ad
miral Walker said that many more
would have to be made, because it was
essential that the engineers should be
absolutely certain of the proper
foundation before beginning the work.
Admiral Walker explained that the
estimate of cost of the canal made by.
the last commission did not include
the expense of governing the canal
zone. . â¢
Admiral Walker, in answer to a ques
tion, said that a large number of in
spectors would be employed by the
commission. These Inspectors would be
engineers and he did not want the law
to provide that they should be selected
through the Civil Service Commission.
"Admiral," said Chairman Hep
burn, "what you^have said in dispar
agement of the Civil Service Commis
sion has been very painful to some
members of the committee. Don't
you think it would be possible for you
to select what charwomen, scavengers
and water-carriers you- will need
through the civil service?"
- "lam very sorry to be misunder
stood," replied the admiral, "because
I am a thorough believer in the civil
service when it does not apply to Us.
But I am very sure that It would not
be satisfactory to the isthmus of
Panama."
the canal would be begun after the
commission had made a stay of a few
weeks on the isthmus, for which it was
to sail March 29.

BERLIN, March 19.â Colonel Leut
wein, the German Governor of South
west Africa,- reports severe fighting
there on March 13. The Germans were
forced to retreat with a loss of seven
officers and nineteen men killed and
five wounded.
Commandant Glazenapp, with a
number of his staff officers and thirty
six cavalrymen, advanced ahead of
his main body and overtook the ene
my's vanguard, which had unexpect
edly received reinforcements. Glaze
napp was forced to retire, losing seven
officers' and nineteen privates killed
and three officers and two privates
wounded.
The -fight occurred on March 13, near
Owilokororo, with the Tet jo tribe of
Hereros, whom Glazenapp was pur
suing. The enemy's loss is not known,
but twenty dead natives were seen.
Glazenapp's detachment had one
machine gun. He is now taking meas
ures to attack" the Hereros' position
in force, and probably will ask for re
inforcements from Major Estereff's
column..
Colonel Leutweln later cabled the
list of the dead, which included the
names of Captain von Francis, Lieu
tenant Kggers and Dr. Velten, a physi
cian of Hablcht. Glazenapp himself
was slightly wounded.
The news of the German reverse
made a disappointing impression on
Berlin, since it involved the most se
vere losses the Germans have yet re
ported, and because it was hoped that
the worst was over. In view of this
latest fight it is regarded as possible
that further reinforcements will be
sent to Southwest Africa.
WORK ON CANAL
TO BEGIN SOON
"At any rate," Dr. Arendt continued,
"all sides agree that the Hereros have
devastated, plundered and destroyed
in a frightful manner. Our only con
cern now is to help our countrymen
without inquiring into the cause of the
rebellion."
The supplementary credits for
Southwest Africa were then voted and
the House resumed the debate on the
military budget.
The Reichstag then adjourned until
April 12.
Dr. Arendt, Conservative, questioned
the veracity of the w,riter of the let
ter Herr Bebel had mentioned. Pri
vate letters, Dr. Arendt added, are
often filled with vain boasting. The
House must wait until the rebellion is
subdued and then try to ascertain the
facts.
AREXDT TAKES ISSUE.
"The reports of the Rhenish Mis
sionary Society," said Herr Bebel,
"show that things are by no means
as bad as reported in the newspapers
friendly to the Colonial office. Those
reports show that the Hereros spare
the whites who prove to be not Ger
mans, like the English, Boers and
Danes. _ It appears therefore that
some of our countrymen have so ill
treated the Hereros that they have
generated a fanatical prejudice against
Germans in general.
"Samuel Maharaero, chief of the
Hereros, continues i the missionary re
port, has given orders that no harm
be done to non-Germans, missionaries,
women or children, but that German
men be shot mercilessly down. They
further report that the Hereros begged
pardon of white women wounded -by
stray shots in fights, saying they did
not wish to hurt defenseless women.
There is 1 no word of truth In' the as
sertion that, the missionaries made
common cause with the; Hereros. On
the other hand, many Hereros took
refuge in * the missionary stations,
which apparently were . regarded "as
places of safety."
Herr Bebel also said the Socialists
after Easter would demand an answer
of the Colonial Office on these mat
ters.
BERLIN, March 19.â In the Relch-
Etag to-day Herr Bebel, the Socialist
leader, referred to the German cam
paign against the Hereros, which, he
said, had taken on a character preju
dicial to Germany's interests and
honor, since all Hereros were killed
and no prisoners were taken. He re
ferred to a fetter from a veterinary
Burgeon, Dr. Baumgart, in the. Leipsic
Neuste Nachrichten, asserting that no
quarter was given and that every
black was shot down. Dr. Baumgart
himself boasting that, like a cannibal,
he bad massacred wounded men.
"Therein can be . seen," continued
Herr Bebel, "how far even our'edu
cated people are becoming brutalized.
Let us not deceive ourselves with^ the
belief that the present occurrences in
Southwest Africa make a demoraliz
ing impression only on -the troops
there. The descriptions sent must also
have a demoralizing and brutalizing
effect on the German people."
Herr Bebel did not deny that the
Hereros also perpetrated cruelties, but
he Intimated that the reports on the
subject sent to Germany were pur
posely colored. .The tales of horror
circulated by the German press were
at least partly untrue, "like the al
leged m,urder of two women, who are
still living."

CLEVELAND, Ohio; March 19.â Wild
scenes of disorder marked the opening
of the Twenty-sixth Congressional Dis
trict convention here to-day as a result
of a fight between the Dick and Fili
pino factions. The trouble started when
the Dick men nominated Charles Leach
as chairman, the Filipinos having al
ready selected J. C. "Ward of Lake
County as the presiding officer. "When
Leach attempted to take the chair he
was assaulted by the Filipinos and a
hand-to-hand fight followed, which
quickly became general.
The police finally arrived in force and
restored order. Each faction, however,
nominated its own committees and
ticket. The Filipinos renominated Ja
cob A. Beldler for Congress and. A. T.
Spltzer and F. H. Eggers as delegates
to the national convention. The . Dick
delegates nominated Jacob. A. Beldler
for Congress by acclamation and chose
J. B. Serge, and A. T. Spitzer as dele
gates to the national convention.
The local adherents of Senator For
aker are known as "Filipinos." The
former Hanna followers are now
termed Dick men, being under the lead
ership of Senator Dick.
The delegates to the national conven
tion are unpledged.
The administration of the criminal
laws at the Harrison-street Police
Court was said to be "more like mob
law than order."

400 men who are characterized as too
old or incapacitated by bad habits are
Captain Piper's remedies.
CHICAGO, March 19. â "There is
practically no^discipline and the force
could hardly be in a worse state."
With these words to-day Captain Alex
ander Ross Piper, retired, former
Deputy Commissioner of the New
York Police Department, who has
been in Chicago for seven weeks* in
vestigating the Chicago police force,
electrified the members of the City
Club. He was making a report of his
investigation, which was begun at the
instance of the club as the result of
the alleged undue prevalence of crime
in Chicago. According to Captain
Piper's report the Chicago police are
in a disgraceful condition of demorali
zation and inefficiency. Instead of
protecting citizens from criminals the
members of the force are drinking in
saloons, playing slot machines or gos
siping on ' the streets. ' Patrolmen
were accused of taking to their 'holes"
at every opportunity instead of walk
ing their beats. Old and incapacitated
men were found in "soft snaps,'- rob
bing the department of active men,
sorely needed. Open gambling was
found by Captain Piper and hand
books were running practically all
over the city.' Some police station
houses were asserted to be unfit for
use and a disgrace to the city.

NEW YORK; March 19.â To-day's
stock market disclosed a lively revival
of speculation and closed buoyant â¢ at
the top -level -.of -the day. Not only was
yesterday's reaction, caused by the Sul
ly failure, more than wiped out, but
net gains were established for the prin
cipal active stocks running from a point
to two points. St. Paul and" Reading
were the -largest gamers, but there was
a very large absorption of Pennsylva
nia and the Pacifies on a rising scale.
The equanimity with which the market
accepted the Sully failure was the cause
of the spurt of bullish enthusiasm. The
events in the cotton market were
viewed, in fact, with some complacency
inihe. stock market, as promising a re
turn^to a price level fairly representa
tive" of conditions of that staple. The
continued ease in the money market
leaves unopposed the advance In the
foreign exchange rates, which contin
ued to-day and approached near to the
point at which gold would go out to
Paris. The total sales of bonds were
$1,105,000.
The long expected Northern- Securi
ties decision on Monday of this week
unlocked the rigid bonds which have
held the stock market in a state of
stagnation many weeks past. The vol
ume of dealings has risen to more than
double that of last week, and prices
for the principal active stocks rose from
two to six points over last week. Rail
road traffic officials as a body have
modified their former discouraging
views of the outlook for new business
and have adopted a more hopeful tone.
The bond market has improved with
stocks, and advancing bids, have been
recorded for some of the high grade in

United States shall be prohibited from
purchasing, leasing or taking any in
terest in any Indian lands the distribu
tion of which was pending during such

cree of the court of claims in the suit
wherein the United States was com
plainant and the Choctaw nation, the
Chickasaw nation, and the Chickasaw
froedmen were defendants and respond
ents. All leases made by any allottee of
the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee,
Scminole of Creek nations shall be ab
solutely null. and void unless recorded
in the manner provided in Indian Ter
ritory within thirty days of the execu
tion of such instruments.

WASHIXGTqJCV March 19. â It Is
probable that ah end may be made of
the. Dominican difficulties by the ex
tension on the i>art of the United
States Government of full recognition
of General Morales as President of
San Domingo. One result of the May
flower's trip was to confirm the offi
cial opinion tliat Morales has sufficient
strength of character and resources
to maintain' a stable government if
the United States and other nations
will prevent the illicit supply of arms
and ammunition. The State Depart
ment already has given some informa
tion on this subject to the shipping
interests doing business with San Do
mingo, having satisfied Itself that
nearly all arms and ammunition Im
ported into San Domingo came from
the United States and there will.be
further action in that direction be
fore* Ions, all with the view to ter
minate the present deplorable coffln
tlon in San Domingo without direct
intervention by the United States.

made to grow from two to five inches
in height, and eny one older than that
may increase his height perceptibly.

of leading physicians, and several
prominent educational institutions
have adopted it for the better
physical development of their pupils.
If you would Uke to increase
your height you should read the
book, \\hich tells how this remark-
able discovery was made and reveals

a fingle cent, arcl if you desire it we
will send you the statements of hun-
dreds who have grown from two to. five
inches in height by following this meth-
od. The results are quickly accom-
pliFhed. Many have grown as much as
three inches in two months. "There is no
inconvenience, no drugs or medicines,
no operation. Merely the application of
a scientific principle in a perfectly hy-
gienic and harmless way. Your most
irtimate friends n<?ed not know what

WASHINGTON, March 19.â In
charge of keepers of the National
Zoologist Park, the cub lion sent to
President Roosevelt as a present from
King Menelik of Abyssinia "arrived to
day from: New York. The keepers
also brought ) the two " fine elephant

of San Jose would lose . much revenue
if the machines are declared gambling
devices, as they are licensed here and
the ctiy derives thousands of dollars
in revenue yearly.
SAN JOSE, March 19.â The petition
for a writ erf mandate of Joseph Fritts
cf Palo Alto to compel Justice Charles
of that place to issue a warrant for
the arrest of George Levin for conduct
ing a gambling game was denied by
Judge Tuttle of the Superior Court this
morning. Levin, who conducts a busi
ness in Mountain View, has a slot ma
chine in his place. On February 17
Fritts went before Justice Charles and
swore to a complaint charging Levin
with conducting a gambling game. The
Justice refused to issue a warrant of
arrest, however. Fritts then carried
the matter to the Superior Court to
compel the Justice ti/. order the arrest
of Levin. Justice Charles- justified his
action by testifying in court to-day
that he was in doubt after the com
plaint was made as to whether slot
machines came under the head of con
ducting gambling games.
Judge Tuttle after the hearing said
that he would take the matter under
advisement. District Attorney Camp
bell said that the case would be ap
pealed, as it was desired to have a
Supreme Court decision on the matter,
and said if the court saw fit to deny
it he would take an appeal at once.
The court then denied the writ.
The case will be watched with much
interest by the saloon-keepers and ci
sar men of this county, for If slot
machines are declared to be gambling
games all these places of business in
the county will be affected. The city

LIVERPOOL, March 19. â The cot
ton market here this morning present
ed a lively appearance in view of the
Sully crash in New York, which was
not announced until after this mar
ket had closed. The galleries aftd bal
cony of the exchange were filled with
onlookers and in the ring the brokers
were waiting until the opening bell
rang. Then they gave vent to thc
pent up excitement which existed be
fore the opening. The market openc-J
26 to 44 ooints lower.
"I am engaged in making a careful
examination of my affairs and at th-j
earliest possible moment I w^ll report
the result- Meanwhile I crave the pa
tient forbearance of you all, feeling
assured that this embarrassment will
be only a temporary one and that I
will be able satisfactorily to adjust
my affairs very speedily." :_-....: .'Â¦
About Jl, 000, 000 of margin money
due to cotton brokers was realized by
Sully signing contracts.
Liverpool Market Is Affected.
The following letter was sent by D.
J. Sully & Co. to Robert P. McDou
gal, president of the New Tork Cot
ton Exchange:
"While I am not prepared to make
a statement of my, affairs, I feel that
.as a member of this exchange I owe
to you and its members at least to say
that the same straightforward method
with which my business has always
been performed between us In the
past will characterize my method iÂ»f
dealing with, my creditors in this
emergency.
NEW YORK. March 19. â The ex
citement in Wall street that was
caused by the announcement yester
day of the suspension of Daniel J.
Sully & Co. was noticeable to-day, but,
gradually subsided during the market
hours and at the close of the cotton
and stock markets it was generally
agreed that the worst of the failure
was over. The stock market was
strong all day. The cotton market
was nervous and slumped sharply en
bad news in the early morning, but be
fore the close even the cotton market
became buoj'ant and moved up to a
point far above the lowest of. yester
day. It was feared that other failures
would follow the Sully crash, but only
one, that of J. H. Garrison, a minor
concern, was reoorted.
After a conference between Sully
and his lawj-ers this morning the firm
made a formal assignment to Joseph
H. Hoadley, who at once took charge.
This action was taken because it was
learned that an attachment was about
to issue and it was thought best to
apply for an assignee for the protec
tion of all creditors alike. Later in
the day a protest against the selection
of Hoadley was made at a meeting of
â¢creditors. Hoadley explained that he
had only accepted the position of as
signee temporarily in order to avoid
the placing of attachments and that
on Monday the creditors would meet
and select a permanent assignee. Sul
ly having declared that he would
agree to any man of their selection.

TOKIO, March 19.â The British Min
ister refuses to indorse the application
of Hales, the crorespondent of the
Daily News, to accompany the Japa
nese army, giving as his reason that
Hales' reports from the Transvaal dur
ing the Boer war were slanderous of
the British army. The Japanese Gov
ernment "requires that all correspond
ents should have the indorsements of
the resident Minister of the country
they represent. Hales therefore will be
excluded from all connection with the

The Government has not yet fully
disclosed the proposal' concerning the
war taxes to be submitted to the spe
cial Diet, about to meet next week, but
it now appears .as though it will not
propose any change in the tariff on
sugar, but will instead recommend a
domestic tax on the basis previously
stated. >
it now seems probable that the only
change effected in the customs tariff
will be an increased duty, on kerosene
and spirits. No discrimination will be
made against Russian kerosene, s be
cause that trade is chiefly in the hands
of British merchants.
It Is expected that there will be se
rious contention in the Diet over the
taxes on sugar and silk, and dealers in
the former commodity are strongly agi
tating for a reduction In the rate which
It is thought the Government will pro
pose. '
Party committees are meeting daily
to discuss the tax proposals, and the
belief is expressed that the Government
will be forced to modify several fea
tures of its plans and that It will fall
to realize the total amount originally
estimated.
If the tobacco monopoly is enacted
it is estimated that it will be ten years

the Government counts upon earnings
from it in 1904 amounting to. 24,000,000
yen, gradually increasing until 1914,
when, it is estimated, they will amount
of 40,000,000 yen.
It is estimated that it will cost the
Government 8.000,000 yen to purchase
the plants and stock required to con
summate the combine and fully 9,000,000

When the ships cleared from Genoa
there was a little delay before they
got away. The Italian Government re
considered its willingness to let them
go. The Russians .had been protesting,
and an officer came aboard the Nisshin
to get the bill of health that had been
given to - Captain Lrea. The . captain
knew that without that document he
could not get by Suez. It was in his
coat pocket. He buttoned up the coat
and politely assured the Italian offi
cial that he was very sorry that it
had been lost. He could not possibly
find it. The Italian was very sorry,
too, but he. went away without the
precious document. Then the Nisshin
got her anchor and started out.
It happened, however, that one of
the Italian stokers had found a com
fortable placeftto snooze' behind one of
the condensers. The first revolution
of the engines sent a jet of steam out
of the condenser that burned thtf'hands
of the sleeping stoker and woke him
with a yell. In a feeconVi the entire
engine-room force was piling up the
ladders and not a man was left at his
post. The captain had set his indi
cators on the bridge, one at full
steam ahead and the other at full
speed astern, in order to swing around
the Kasug-a, which was still at a/ichor.
But he got no . response and saw his
ship drifting rapidly down on her
mate. So he had t â¢ let go the anchor
again and send down to find out what
was the matter. The deck force was
all English, the engine-room hands all
Italians, j none of whom spoke Eng
lish. None of the Englishmen spoke
Italian. The bridge indicators were
in English, but the corresponding sig
nals in the engine-room were in Ital
ian,. It was a poor means of holding
the sort of conversation needed to ex
plain the difficulty. In fact, the cap
tain did riot get it explained' until he
TOKIO, Japan, Feb. 23.â It took the
naval victories at Port Arthur to rouse
Japan from the awesome quiet with
.which she watched the fighting prepa- 1
rations at the outbreak of. the" war, but
it was the arrival of the two cruisers,
Nisshin and Kasuga, that really started
the cheering. In the reception of the
men who brought out the two new
fighting ships the Japanese^ have shown
how enthusiastic they can be when
they are properly stirred up. It was
a fine run, and no doubt about it, and
there were some exciting incidents
during it, but in the main it was only
a plain case of good sailor work with
a fortunate ending. As Captain I^ea;
who commanded the Nisshin, says,
"We only did our duty."
You wouldn't exactly pick Captain
Lea put for a farmer, but he declares
he was actually following the plow
about his place In England when he
got the word that started him here.
He had only half an hour to catch his
train and as he ran for it he shouted
to the foreman to sell the twenty-eight
heifers and the bull Â¦ calf.- and now.
after' all this time and excitement, he
has ho idea whether the man did it
or not. He is the sort of man in ap
pearance whom you would be most
likely to choose for such an under
taking, short and stocky, with twink
ling: blue eyes and a ready smile, a
neck that rises like a column out of
a pair of solid shoulders and is
crowned by a head half an inch longer
from the point of the lower jaw to
the back than from the top of the
forehead to the back. It is that jaw
which makes you love him on sight.
When he starts out to do anything be
careful, not- to get in his way if you
wish to avoid trouble.
OUTWITS ITALIAN OFFICIAL.
"Why," said Captain Lea, "I've
enough to fill the baggage-room of
the hotel already and there's no tell
ing when it will stop. If we'd been
emperors fourteen times over we
couldn't have had a finer reception,
and all we did was our duty. We're
not half through yet, either," and he
read off a list of places where they
have promised to go. There surely
Is no doubt about the gratitude of
Japan to the men of the Nisshin and
Kasuga.
From Nlkko they came back to Tokio,
where to-day they all had audience
with the Emperor again and he dis
tributed among all the officers most
magnificent gifts. Those to the two
captains included a pair of beautiful
silver vases, executed , by the royal
workmen, and of a pattern whioh: has
never been, sent out of Japan, - Both
bear the royal ere"st imgoldf. There was
also for each captain a beautiful old
gold lacquer box of great value. > ;Â¦; '
Meantime gifts of all sorts have been
pouring in for them from cities to
which they cannot go, accompanied by
yards of addresses setting forth in
Japanese eloquence the great "things
they have done for Dai Nippon.
GIFTS FROM THEIR RULER.
The, next day the men came up to
Tokio. Here it was all done over again.
Hut,- more than that, they were re
ceivedâthat is, the captains wereâ by
the Emperor himself, who expressed his
personal appreciation of their service
to his country and gave them the or
der of the Rifling: Sun. For the men of
the crews there were all kinds of do
ings in Hiblya Park. There was a big
wrestling bout, at which the most cele
brated wrestlers in Japan did stunts,
and there was juggling of the most
wonderful kind, with very gay daylight
fireworks during the afternoon. At
night the park was ablaze with lan
terns and there was a gorgeous dis
play of fireworks.
Â¦That evening there was a banquet
given by the Mayor of Tokio. ; In the
gladness of his heart he { had invited
the men of .the crews as well as the
officers, Jjut the captains had indi
cated . their disapproval of that,
so another entertainment was pro
vided for the sailormen. The Mayors
of many other Japanese cities were
present at the banquet, and" invita
tions to the officers of the two ships to
visit other places in Japan came in in
showers. Every city sent some sort of
token of recognition of the service ren
dered to Japan. Fortunately for the
officers they are all under contract to,
go back home in a few days, so that
they will escape the hard penalty of
too much generous hospitality.
From Tokio they all went up to
Nikko, and there they did have a time.
The road from the station to their ho
tel was lined with a double rank of
Waving lanterns and bands played and
crowds cheered and shouted "Banzai!"
Then a remarkable thing happened.
The two captains were taken to the
great temple, where the high priest
took them into the most sacred cham
bers, into some of which only the Em
peror himself may go. .No other for
eigner has ever been in them, and most
of the priests themselves are not per
mitted to enter these sacred rooms.
Yokohama had the first chance at the
crews of the two cruisers. There was
a Darade and a great garden party in
the, public park, -with addresses and
fireworks and a banquet in the evening.
The city was decorated with banners
and flags and streamers, and at night
there were flocks' of lanterns.
DECORATED BY EMPEROR.
From the time they reached the lim
its of the Yokosuka station, however,
things changed. Their troubles were
over. A guard of torpedo-boats escorted
the two ships up to the 6tatlon and
there were bands and. banners. Since
that It has, b'^en^a grand v round of en
tertainments,' banquets arid receptions.
Committees had been busy for weeks
making arrangements, ajid all Japan
was- waiting eagerly to see the men
who brought out the two ships. | The
fact that the navy, crippled as it was
by the loss of the big first-class battle
ship Shikishima. which is still in dock
at Sasebo repairing the damage done
in maneuvering, had already done up
the Russian fleet, did hot in the least
impair the enthusiasm of the Japanese
about the new arrivals. The new ships
were not nee;led, but they might have
been, and the people were just as glad
to see them, or rather the men who
brought them, as If they had come just
in tl.e nick of time. The people will
have no chance to see the ships them
selves for some time, and no one ex
cept the naval authorities has been per
mitted to get, a rJimpse of them.
The most interesting part of their
voyage was that from Singapore up.
The situation was so critical when they
left Singapore, in the early days of
this month, that they. were ordered to
go outside of Formosa'and not to stop
at Htmgkong, but to come straight
away to Yokosuka, the big naval sta
tion near Yokohama. * The captain did
not know how much coal they had.
The "limits of conversation with the
chief engineer prevented him from
finding out exactly what thÂ« coal con
sumption per day was, and he had the
stiff winds of the northwest monsoon
to meet in the China Sea. So he came
along with only a part of the boilers
steaming, and just fire enough under
the others to keep the water warm,
ready In case of an emergency. They
had no desire whatever to meet any of
the Russian squadron, and they knew
how easy it would be for the Russians
to figure out exactly where they were
at any time. The only thing to do
was to run the best they could. \A.s
soon as they got out of the rough water
Captain Lea sent for his chief engineer
and made signals to him which that
gentleman could not help understand
ing.
"We had something to lose," said the
captain in telling about it. "Our Gov
ernment had cut us adrift. They can
celed our commissions before we left
Genoa because they t were .afraid we
might get them into some international
complications. (He and Captain'Payn

So. by pror.-ess of elimination, â¢ the

the conclusion that the vessels. of the

COALING BASE FOR TOGO.
The Government's private informa
tion is not reassuring as regards
China's sincerity In observing a neu
tral attitude. Secret advices indicate
that at least a powerful party in the
Chinese Government is abetting the
Japanese. Although at first reluctant
to credit these reports, the Russian
authorities continue to receive evi
dence that the Japanese contemplate
landing- on Chinese neutral territory,
west of the Liao River, and 17,000
men are being held especially to await
developments in that direction.
The representations of the United
States Minister to 'Japan, Griscom,
concerning 'American interests affected
by the creation of the Japanese to
toaceo monopoly, will, the Novoe
Vremya believes, sharpen American-
Japanese relations. It considers the
tobacco monopoly absolutely neces
sary for Japan, in the present condi
tion of her finances, and says the com
pensation claimed by the Americans
would more than eat up the income
from the monopoly in the first years,
thus creating for Japan a situation,
"the full meaning of which it is prob
able is quite appreciated at Washing
ton."

PITIFUL STORY
NORTON, Kans., March 19. â
Chauncey Dewey and his two cowboys,
Clyde Wilson and William J. McBride,
were acquitted to-night of the charge
of murdering Burchard Berry by a
jury, which had considered the case
twenty-eight hours.
Chauncey Dewey, a young million
aire " ranchman, went to Cheyenne
County, Kans., early in 1900 to man
age the Dewey ranch. He became In
volved in trouble with the Berry fam
ily, who were also prominent cattle
men. Trivial misunderstandings grew
into serious differences, which â¢ cul
minated in the killing of Burchard
Berry in June, 19jO3, at the home of AI
pheus Berry during a fight in which
Dewey and . one of his cowboys were
pitted against all of the Berrys. Dewey
and his cowboys went toÂ» the Berry
ranch to get a tank which Dewey had
bought at a Sheriff's sale. When the
Deweys started to take the tank
away- the Berry boys rode up and a

After the meethis to-night President
Schaeffer of the Amalgamated Associa
tion made a statement for publication.
He said that the reduction which is
proposed is caused by the commercial
stringency and the keen competition
which exists In the tin and sheet. trade,
and the fact that, there are many idle
mills of this kind with thousands of
Amalgamated men out of employment.
A direct reply to the Question whether
the reduction would result in idle mills
starting up again was insisted upon.
He then said that this question had
been asked by the Amalgamated of
ficials of both the American Company
and the independents, and that the uni
form reply was that no such assurance
could be given, and that a few weeks
after the scale was actually assured
would be required for the manufac
turers to secure orders on the new
basis. .

QUESTION OF REDUCTION
TO BE SUB2HITTED TO MEN
The authorities here are satisfied
from their own reports that Turkey's
fears of the Armenian agitators ara
magnified and largely unwarranted.
They do not share the belief in many
of the recent statements of Turkish
atrocities, but the authorities here have
good reason to believe that such atroc
ities may begin in the real work of
repiesslon. It is expfected, therefore,
tha^the powers will act through the'r
embassies at Constantinople, eithur
jointly or on common lines, with the
view to preventing the execution of any
widespread bloodshed or the extermina
tion of the Armenians.
Foreign Minister Delcasse will send a
yellow book to Parliament next week.
This will deal chiefly with the Mace
donian situation, but incidentally with
other Turkish issues.
The Sultan's activity is not directed
against the Armenians as a whole, but
against those of the Sassun district,
who are a 'turbulent mountainous peo
ple. Turkey claims that the Armenian
mountaineers go across the border into
Russia, where they arm and equip
themselves and return to commit dep
redations against the Turkish soldiers.
Therefore it is the view of the Sultan
that stern measures are necessary to
repress these agitators.
PARIS, March 19.â It is the expecta
tion in official quarters that France and
the "signatory powers of the Berlin
treaty will unite in emphatic repre
sentations to Turkey against carrying
out the Sultan's plans for the suppres
sion and probable extermination~bf a
considerable portion of the Armenians.
The Government is in possession of
much information showing the nature
of the troubles and Turkey's intention
in dealing with them. This information
shows . that some reports of the atroc
ities have gone too far, but indicates
the necessity of staying Turkey's hand
within a month, as the 1 main pro
gramme for the suppression is to com
mence about a month hence. The re
ports received give both sides of. the
case and show the following general
situation: Â»
CALL. .BUREAU. HOTEL. BARTON,
WASHINGTON, March 19.â Captain
Hugh J. Gallagher of the general staff
of the United States army says con
cerning the Far East conflict:
"Climaticconditlons will hamper and
delay decisive movements of great land
operations for some time. In the mean
time both belligerents v.ill continue to
put forth efforts to place their great
armies in condition and position to as
sume an active role as soon as the
severe weather moderates sufficiently
to permit the men to march.
"When the Yalu River opens the Rus
sian forces south of it probably will
withdraw and Japan will then find her
self face to face with the first great
military problem in her land 'operations
âthe crossing of the Yalu in the face
of an active enemy. In this movement
she will doubtless receive the assist
ance of her navy. The Russians re
maining south of the Yalu then would
have to fight a battle with the river
behind them and that river probably
patrolled by the enemy's warships.
"The landing reported to have been
effected by the Japanese at Takushan,
on the north coast of Korea. Bay. If
made at all, was probably made in
small force and with â¢ the object of
creating a diversion. During the war
with China the Japanese landed a large
force upon this coast, about fifty miles
from Takusban, in the direction of Port
Arthur. They met with no opposition.
They can scarcely hope to meet with
equal good fortune under the present
circumstances. It may safely be as
sumed that the points along this part
of the coast where a landing is pos
sible are well occupied by the Rus
sians and ' plans for reinforcing any
threatened locality have been carefully
arranged. Consequently Japan could
not hope to accomplish anything in
that field without a strong force. To
attempt to land and maintain such a
'force in the face of an enemy would

cidedly not warrant.
"That Japan is fully alive to the dif
ference in conditions as they exist now
and as they were ten years ago is
beyond doubt. The Chinese had no
great railroad to protect and Port Ar
thur did not then possess the impor
tance for them that it does now for
Russia. A slower method of penetrat
ing into the enemy's country will prob
ably commend itself to the. Japanese.
"The effect of the fire from the bat
tleships upon the fortifications' at Port
Arthur has been found quite insignifi
cant when compared with the amount
of energy expended against them. Port
Arthur being strongly fortified and
armed after modern methods, it is safe
to say that the damage so far sus
tained has not been considerable.
"The problem that confronts Russia
in connection with the land operations
is to so dispose her troops as to guard
her lines of communication against a
sudden descent upon the coast and at
the same time keep In hand a suffi
cient force to meet any determined ad
vance of the enemy. The line which
Russia must cover extends from Vladi
vostok to Port Arthur and from Port
Arthur to Newchwang."

officers who were leaving for the front.
A special dispatch from St. Peters

to the Irkutsk depot and Lake Baikal,
leaving the railway free for the con
veyance of troops.
According to the Tokio correspondent

PARIS. March 19.â The Figaro's cor

a German officer who has just arrived
there from Manchuria says serious
operations in the Far East will not be

principal obstacle to a Russian victory,
according to this officer, is the fact that
40,000 Chinese troops, well trained and

BURGLATIS REAP HARVEST
OX trjJARBELL STREET
A ripple of excitement was created
in the Southern Pacific building yes
terday just before the offices closed,
when the announcement was made
that Julius Kruttschnitt Is Â»oon to re
linquish the position of general man
'iger of the road to accept one of
higher authority in Chicago. Within
! the next ten days a circular will be
issued from the offices of E. H. Harri
man in New York announcing Mr.
Kruttschnitt's promotion to the posi-
I tlon of "director of transportation" of
! the Harriman lines, with headquarters
1 in Chicago. The title is to be created
| for him, giving him rank with Traf
| lie Director J. C. Stubbs in the man
agement of all lines operated by, the
Harriman syndicate. It was stated yes
terday by Mr. Kruttschnitt that his
successor here will be Charles H.
Markham, at present vice president
and general' manager of the Galveston,
ilarrisburg and San Antonio Railway
and tlfe Houston and 'Texas Central
Railroad In Texas. As yet General
Manager Kruttschnitt has not learned
just when he will relinquish his duties,
here, but he expects that the change
will 'lake place within me next four
weeks.
In the elevation of Mr. Kruttschnitt
to the position of director of transpor
tation of the Harriman lines. President
R. H. Harriman is carrying out a plan
of centralization which he has had un
der consideration for a long time. Hla
first move in this. direction was the ap
pointment of J. C. Stubbs to the posi
tion of traffic director. Next he under
took the standardizing of all the roads
he controls, and- several days ago he
ordered Passenger Traffic Manager E.
O. McCormlck to Chicago to take
Â¦charge of the passenger business of the
Harriman lines, thus relieving Assist
ant .Traffic . Director Ben Campbell of
part of his duties. Now comes the ad
vancement of Julius Kruttschnitt, and
before his plans of centralization are
fully effected it is probable that many
other changes of- a minor character
will have been made on the various
lines west of Chicago. .
The announcement of General Man
ager Kruttschnitt's advancement will
be received as a pleasant surprise Â¦ by
many of his friends in' this city. who
will naturally accept it as- an indica
tion of the great confidence - which
President Harriman reposes in him.

At the meeting of the Board of
Fire Commissioners yesterday the r#
port of City Engineer Grunsky and
Consulting Engineer Stut was rejected
as not being in harmony with the
work for which they had been em
ployed and for which the sum of $500
had been appropriated by the Board
of Supervisors. This work was to de
vise a plan by which the city could
secure an abundant supply of salt
water from the ocean for the Fire
i Department, street sprinkling and the
I 1 flushing of sewers.
The object desired; by the officials
is that a reservoir be._ placed on Twin
[ Peaks containing about 10,000,000 gal
! Ions of salt water, which would be
ample to meet all requirements of th2
Fire Department in case* of a great
conflagration without having to de
pend on the supply furnished by the
Spring Valley Water Company.
Engineer Grunsky and his confrere
dealt more, according to the views en
tertained by the Commissioners, with
! the securing c. a sufficient water sup
ply from the Spring Valley Water
Company and the limited salt ..water
supply conducted by the Olympic
Club, which had been offered for city
use, than with a plan to v furnish a sup
ply independent of all sources con
trolled by companies or corporations.
President Boyne has given the
members of the Fire Department to

City Attorney Long yesterday ad
vised the Board of Supervisors that the
petition of the estate of J. K. C. Hobbs
for the return of the taxes paid on
509,475. on deposit In commercial banks,
but afterward invested in non-taxable
securities, may be lawfully allowed, and
that no useful purpose would be served
by a reference of the matter to . the
courts. The money was assessed by As
sessor Dodge on the ground that it had
been withdrawn from the banks pre
vious to the first Monday in March,
1903, and then invested in bonds for the
purpose of evading the taxes thereon, a
fact admitted by one of the executors
of the estate. Long's opinion continues:

An unusually heavy storm came in
from the ocean yesterday afternoon
and struck the coast at San Francisco.
It wag accompanied by high winds
and traveled rapidly. . The barometer
readings were low In the northern
,part of California. The rainfall was
general except in the vicinity of Los
Angeles, where it Is most needed.
A wind velocity of fifty miles an
hour was reported from Nevada,
j thirty-six miles from Farallones, for
1 ty-two in this city, fifty at Point
Reyes and sixty-three on Mount Tarn

fore the storm as a result of the warm
weather in the mountains. Professor
McAdie of the Weather Bureau stated
last night that the Yuba, American,
Feather and Sacramento rivers would
probably be swollen to dangerous pro
portions to-day.
The rainfall for March thus far is
about four inches. The rainfall' up to

CORPORATIONS
LOSE CONTEST
Supreme Court Denies All
Petitions for Eehearing
in the "Franchise Case"
The corporations of this State must
pay taxes on their franchises. The Su
preme Court has handed down its final
decision in the matter, and there can
be no further appeal. The petitions for
a rehearing have been denied without
comment, and a.remittitur has gone
down to the Superior Court.
The case in which this point was in
volved was brought by the Bank of
California against the city and county
of San Francisco. A decision w*Â« ren
dered in favor of the municipality on
February 18. The corporations through
out the State rallied for a contest, and
some of California's ablest lawyers filed
a formidable array of new arguments
in the case. The Supreme Court post
poned further action until the new
features of the contest had been
thoughtfully considered. Yesterday the
court issued a formal notice that it
would not alter its previous decision.
The Bank of California will pay about
$12,000 more for taxes " than formerly,
and other, corporations will have to pay
in proportion to their wealth. . The
value of a corporation's franchise under
the decision will be considered to . be
the difference between the value of the
concern's tangible property and the
market value of :' its stock. The court
holds that a franchise is a property.; It
was not previously so considered. :
Assessor Dodge assessed the Bank of
California for a franchise. The v cor
poration held that 5 it did â¢ not , possess
one.' The dispute was carried into the
Superior Court, where a decision -in
favor of the municipality was rendered.'
An â¢appeal was at once taken to/ the
Supreme Court, which upheld the judg
ment of the inferior tribunal. â¢Under
the final judgment the corporations of
TRUCK EE, March 19.â The heavy
rainstorm ragring to-day caused the
waters of Lake Tahoe to rise with
alarming rapidity. Last night it was
thought that the danger point was re
moved at least a week, it being figured
that it would take that Ions: for the
water to reach the tor> of the dam.
Several expert dam builders began
'.vork this morning to strengthen the
darn and to prevent undermining. If it
is deemed necessary steamers and
'ighters will be used to gather rocks
from the lake shore to build a new
<lam below the eld one. The snow on
the ground prevents the procurement
of material by quarrying. Last night
the electric lights in town were extin
guished after S o'clock, the high water
in the Truckee River rendering the tur
bine wheels of the electric light plant
I>oxverless. The flood-gates were kept
wide cr>en nearly all day. A few were
close'd early this evening on account of
the current washing away embank
ments and increasing the danger. Man
ager Duane Bliss at Tahoe sent word
last night that there is no Immediate
danger.
People at Reno are making constant
inquiries about the condition of the
dam. A tidal wave would do immense
damage here; five miles of the Southern
Pacific Company's' track and many
bridges would be destroyed, and four
teen miles of the Tahoe narrow gauge
road would be carried away.
Manager Bliss states that the lake
was higher once before the dam was
constructed than now, and' that the
carrying away of the dam would' not
necessarily cause the lake to cease ris
ing, because the outlet would be too
small. j
The lake has a circumference of more
than 100 miles, and more than 400
square miles of â¢watershed. The surface
water is now seven inches from the
tcp cf the dam. i
GRASS VALLEY. March 19.â The
heaviest rainrtorm experienced in this
section for years visited this city to
night from 5 to 6 o'clock. The rain,
driven by a fierce wind, came down in
blinding sheets. Wolf Creek, which
i'ows through the city, is out of its
basics and flooding sidewalks and the
surrounding lowland. More than 52
Inches have fallen this season to date,
a figure that has not beÂ«n reached in

"But recently a wonderful thing has
happened, for I had never expected to
have the use of my limbs again; a
four months' diet of Grape-Xuts Food
for breakfast and cupper made the
change and now. Just" think of It, I
can move my toes freely on my left
foot and a little on the right foot, and
can let the footpiece on my chair down
and gwins my feet vigorously, which
I think Is a wonderful improvement for
the time I have used the food.
"And that is not all! My blood and
my stomach are so much better I am
confident my trouble came from too
much rich food and an overstrain of
t he nerves, but my nerves are much
better, my mind is clearer and I don't
forget things like I did. It must be the
food, for I stopped taking medicine
years ago for the paralysis.
Of course I have the sympathy and
prayers of many Christians, but it Is
wonderful what good pure food will do
for one out of health, and why would
it not be as Rood to keep one's health
up? I have heard lots of others praise
<Jrape-Nuts, but I for one cannot
praise ,it enough." Name given by
Postum Company. Battle Creek, Mich.
Here was a well defined case of
paralysis which came from weakened
r.crves and blood trouble, and which
bejjan yielding almost immediately
when proper food, ' Grape-Xuts," was
.substituted for improper, food. There's
a reason.
' Look in each pkg. for the famous
little book. "The Road to WellvIIle."*

haven't walked a step for over, twelve
years, not able to move my feet, or

EMPEROR' AND. KING SAVE
THE LIFE OF YOUNG BOY'
The girl' claims to have been married
when she-was 16 years old to a man
living at Wymore, Neb., who deserted
her the following year.
The most successful part of her work
was in disposing of her plunder, none
of which hag ever been recovered. It
is believed she carried it to another
town before parting with it.
When arrested she had a silk dress
and ether valuables done up in a bun
dle. A dozen persons in whose homes
the girl worked have been to the police
station \ and identified her. They all
say that her neat and courteous man
ner won their confidence and disarmed
all suspicion.
A: demure and ccmmonplace looking
domestic, Ella Hurst would , hire out
as 'a , housemaid, and, whenever op
portunity offered, would pack up a
number of valuables, which, it is sup
posed,were disposed of through some
confederate. After each. theft the girl
left the city suddenly and on her re
turn after a month or two- hired out
to a new family and successfully kept
up the game until she has worked the
houses of about a score of wealthy
people. She carried off valuables from
all except the last.
The property ; taken includes opera
glasses, men's dress suits, hand-painted
china' cut glass, overcoats, suits of
clothes, punch glass sets, umbrellas,
jewelry, silverware and watches.

summer up Mount : Washington . In the

has been to get permission to use the
mountain road for such a purpose. *Ne-'

been closed. The present intention is
to hold the contest during ... the -latter

start will be made near the foot of the
mountain and the contest, which .'â¢will
virtually be an endurance test, will last

NEW YORK, March 19. â The
Financieritliis week says:. ;
The feature of- the official statement
of the New , York Associated i Banks
last week was the wide ~ discrepancy
between the cash changes as shown by
the bank returns and those indicated
by the estimates which were based
on the traceable movements of money
during the week. The official state
ments showed an unaccountable los 3
of $2,690,300 cash, while the estimates
called for a gain of about this sum,
or $2,743,000. Loans were increased,
but not to the extent looked for, the
amount of gain. being: $1,519,800.Â°
The statement did not show agood
balance, the sum of loss of cash, less
the increase in loans, being:, greater by
$915,000 than the decrease -in
deposits. This failure of the return
to balance was probably due to' the
bank merger . operations. The daily
average of clearings was $185,000,000,
an increase of "$25,000,000 compared
with the , previous ; week, reflecting
more active speculation on the Stock
Exchange and. possibly showing the
loans due to- the collapse in the cot
ton deal. The clearings reported on
Saturday, representing Friday's busi
ness, were $190,475,245, or above^the
average.
One incident of the .week- was the
merger of, the Central National by the
Citizens', which became effective Mon

The Hotel St. Francis begins business
to-morrow. Incorporated in its construc
tion and equipment are the latest ideas
known to the hotel world. The factories
and looms of America and Europe have
combined to render its service, comfort
and fittings second to no hotel in Amer
ica. Those who have inspected its*fur
nishings state that no American hotel
equals it in appointment and finish. Bet
ter^ furniture cannot ba made. Any more
costly would amount purely to extrava
gance. Variety of design and richness
of material characterize every suite and
room. Five types have been selected,
viz.: Colonial. Empire, Sheritan, Louis
XV. with clxairs of the Chippendale pat
tern for the dining-room. Each piece has
been made to special order and the ag
gregate undoubtedly comprises the larg
est single order for furniture ever placed
en the. coast. The entire contract was
given to \V. & J. Sloane & Co. of this
city, and the installation has been com
plete in every detail. Four hundred and
fifty rooms have been furnished aside
from the cafe, dining-room, ladies' par
lor, library, banquet rooms, private dln-
Ins-rooms. lounging-room and ladies' re
ception reom and grill. The respective
lines represented in the furnishings were
either made by Slocnc & Co., or by
agencies controlled by them for the
coast. As an instance, the rugs in the
ladies' reception-room and parlor are
hand-tufted Bagdad, a line of â¢ fabrics
that they have exclusively represented
in the Vnited States for the past fifty
years. The carpets have been especially
woven to order, those of the* corridors
being all of one piece. They are" of heavy
quality of Saxonia pile carpet. The din
ing-room carpet is of special: design and
color, and weighs 2300 pounds. For
these goods Sloane & Co. are sole repre
sentatives. The draperies in dining-room,
library and ladies' parlor are of silk ve
lour and mohair plush, richly embroidered
in gold. The fifteen private .parlors arc
hung with rich brocatelle and silk dam
ask tapestries. The mattresses and bed
ding are thebest procurable, and in this
feature /as in all others, no expense has
been spared. An order of this size and
character so completely and promptly
filled would do credit to any, establish-"
ment in America, and it is especially so
to a local business house. Â¦ Sloane ;& Co.
have unequalcd .facilities for - executing
an order of this size by virtue of their
ample workshops. ' tlieir large force" of
competent men and of * the high-class
agencies' they exclusively 'represent.
â¢ The prestige of Sloane & Co. inithe
furniture world was no doubt largely in
strumental in their this order
for furniture, and it is undoubtedly true
that.no order ever filled by them has so
contributed to their prestige. Bfi

During the two years in San Fraa:is:a ihi Elsclro-ChÃnic Insiiufs has published tfea tsÂ»-

"â¢ T A PIONEER'S TESTIMONY.
Below we publish the tastiinonial of a gentleman, whose standing; In the com-
mnnity must surely add weight to his words of recommendation.
Mr. Jacob Bryan is a man of such sterling" worth and character, that aH**thÂ«
money in %an Francisco could not influence him to say anything; Â»â¢ d* 4 n0 *
mean. Mr. Bryan has lived at Colma for thirty-seven years. He was chairman
of the Beard of Supervisors for four years. He was Postmaster at Colma for
twelve years. He has been a Kotary Public for fourteen years. He is a man of
independent means, owning; considerable valuable real estate in Saa Francisco.
Mr. Bryan says in his testimonial that any one wishing; to know morÂ« about
his successful treatment at the Electro-Chemic Institute is at liberty to call oa
him at his home in Colma, where everybody knows him. or to write him if they
find it inconvenient to call.

Caliente, Cal. What Is known as tha
bottle imp hoax was one of the most
brazen impositions ever practiced on
the credulous English public. It was
the result of a wager between the
Duke of Montague and a friend. In
discussing the amazing gullibility of
the English he declared that if an im
postor were to advertise that he would
jump into a quart bottle all London
would go to see him do it. The wager
was taken up and an advertisement
Inserted in all the papers that the
event would take place In the Hay
market Theater. January 16. 16?9.
The theater on that night was packed,
and many thousands were turned
from the door. The conjurer ap
peared on the stage and told the peo
ple that if they would pay double price
he would jump into a pint instead of
a cuart bottle. He then made his exit
through a rear door and carried ofC
the box receipts with him. The af
fair ended in a riot and the theater
Was almost wrecked. The Duke of
Montague and his betting friend had
to leave the city and remainraway un

King Edward, through his Lord
Chamberlain in. England, has availed
himself of the sovereign prerogative to
put a stop to the public singing of all
topical songs bearing upon the war and
which tend to ridicule or to cast ob
loquy upon one or the other of the bel
ligerents. Of course the songs can be
sung in private, but thanks to the Lord
Chamberlain's peremptory commands,
they cannot be given on the stage of
any theater or music hall, under the
penalty of the forfeiture of the llcensa
of the place, and of all sorts of penal
ties In the way of fine and imprison
ment for. the singer, the composer and
the" management of the house.
In most other European countries the
censorship of the. drama and of every
thing connected with the stage is ex
ercised by the Government. But in
England it has, at any rate for. the last
two hundred years, been the legal pre
rogative of the sovereign, 'who has In
variably exercised It through his Lord
Chamberlain, the. latter in turn relying
upon the judgment of an official of his
department^ " who la known *as the
"reader of plays,'.' and Â¦ whose verdict,

" The populace of San Francisco and all the wiseacres
of the weather are still speculating in wonderment at
the windstorm that recently rattled our windows and
blew down our fences. For us it was indeed a heavy

gratulate ourselves that what we considered a phenome
non would have been in many less favored places of the
United States an ordinary wind hardly serious enough to
give premonition of usual danger. '
CENTENNIAL OF THE; CODE NAPOLEON.
ON March 21 France will -celebrate the centennial
of the r institution of that famous codification of
â¢- law known as the Code Napoleon. On that' date
one^hundred years ago the all-powerful First Consul;
soon to -assume the purple of empire, pressed the pass

cil of State and the 'shadowy lower house of the Legis-
COMETâ A. S., City. The great comet
of 1S61 was discovered by Teebutt at
Sydney. Australia. May 13 of that year.
On June 29 and 30 it was discovered in
France and In England. It was Donati's
comet, so named from the fact that It
was discovered by Dr. Donati at Flor
ence^ in June, 1S3S, that was credited
with "having great influence in France
on the vintage. It Is a fact that that
year was a favorable season, and the
products were advertised as "les vin3
de la comet." This, like many other
speculations on comets, has no scien
tific basis.
THIS State had its first impulse in the discovery of
gold, and though mighty interests have taken the
place formerly held by the hunt for gold there is
hardly a Californian to-day that will not drop pruning
hook. and plow, hammer and plane, and go to mining on
the slightest provocation. There is a lure and fascina
tion in taking primitive value, the standard of all values,
right out of the soil and sand and stones that is not the
attribute of any other business or occupation of man.
In the production of metals and minerals the State is
doing quite well. Mr. Auburjv State Mineralogist, has
just issued the Teport of the State Mining Bureau on
California' mines and minerals. It gives the production
for the -calendar year 1902, as the statistics for 1903 are
not completed. The total value of metals and minerals
produced that year was $35,069,105; of* which gold was
$16,910,320. The next highest value was .petroleum,
$4,692,i?9. For the first time hydraulic cement figured
with some importance, its value being $423,600. In all
we produce 42 metals and minerals. ,-Thc semi-precious
stones appear in the list, for we marketed $11,600 worth
of turquoise," the quantity being 510 pounds. The pro
duction of slates for architectural purposes has reached
important proportions, and the chemical minerals, as
borax, soda, manganese and salt, add very considerably
to the State's wealth.
It must not be understood that the low product of gold
means that our mines are exhausted. The policy of the
Federal Government- which prevents the use of elec
tricity in fining over a considerable part of the mother
lode has ': reduced j the- gold output by many millions; If
the people had/access to the hydraulic power that is so
abundant',insicle the forest and park reserves the gold
output would soon be doubled-. The most profitable of
our. mines. are the great kdges of low-grade ores. When
electric power is accessible these become profitable, but
they cannot be worked by steam power on account of its
excessive cost. ...
In mineral products Shasta. County led with the lar
gest output . In gbkhNevada led, with Calavcras a close
second, and Mariposa, for the lack of electric power, is
eleventh on the list, 'with only $631478 product. She
might easily approximate the head of the column if per
mitted to use power.
The report gives the output iby^ counties of "each of the
minerals and metals,. arid contains .a great deal of inter
esting and valuable information, showing that the days
of gold have not disappeared," andVthat Californians do
not â¢ abate their ; interest in the .wealth that may be dug
from the ground. . * ; . Â¦

If !a reasonable time after the close
of the war elapses and the soldier does
not return, he is counted among the
lost and unidentified dead, and his wife
obtains the divorce from that rabbi
granting her the right to remarry.
Every married soldier, volunteer or
reserve, registers with a rabbi his
name, address, age, height, birthmarks,
name of company and regiment he
joins, and the rabbi keeps a record of
same until the soldier returns from the
war. .
According to the Jewish World, a
very touching editorial appeared In a
recent issue of the Hebrew Daily Haze
firah of- Warsaw, Poland, where the
editor, Mr. Sorolow, calls attention to
the Talmudic law which requires every
married man before going on the bat
tlefield to grant a conditional divorce
to his wife, that she may remarry if
he does not return within a reasonable
time after the end of the war. '.;>;â¢
The rabbis of Lodz have Caused all
the Jewish soldiers that left that city,
for the seat of war. to grant such di
vorces, and Editor ISorolow suggests
that the example of Lodz should be
copied all over Russia.

ROSE DIAMONDâ D. C, City. Rosa
diamond does not apply to the color of
the gem, but to the manner of cutting
the same. A rose diamond is faceted
in the surface and flat in the back.
It is nearly hemispherical and cut into
twenty-fo,ur triangular planes or fa
cets. Rose diamonds are made of those
stones too broad In proportion to their
depth to be cut as brilliants. Stones
that are thinner than rose diamonds
are called table diamonds.
TO REVIVE FLOWERSâ Esther.
City. It is said that flowers that
have drooped after being cut may be
revived by cutting: off one inch of the
stems and placing the fresh cut sterna
in a cup of water heated to about 120
degrees.
A Chinese reformer informed President Roosevelt
the other day that already there are enrolled in the
Chinese reform party 25,000,000 people. Even if we
accept these figures without the grain of salt necessary
in connection with everything Chinese we must insist
that no showing of measurable value has been made.
Even though every one of the 400,000,000 of the Celestial
Empire were enrolled in the reform party ,they would
have : to give something more substantial than their
words to prove that their intentions are honorable.

The Youth's Companion prints a
story to the effect that notwithstanding
the disparity in size between Seattle
and Tacoma, the rivalry in other re
spects between the two cities is as keen
as,ln their earlier days, when they were
young "boom" towns. ; . \
A curious instance of this is seen In
the names by which the towering
mountain that lifts its tall peak to the
southeast Is known In the two places.
In Tacoma it is treason to call it any
thing else than "Mount Tacoma." while
in Seattle it is "Mount Ranier."
A traveler when about half way be

fighting by the roadside. Before he
could separate them one of the boys
got the other down, and after banging
the victim's face into the soft ground,
sat panting but victorious astride of
him.
"What's the name o' that mountain
now?" the victor demanded, in exultant
tones.

Mr. Greeley would never have dis
turbed them, but he always complied
with his wife's wishâ in his own time

hat, he shouted:

At one time Horace Greeley lived la
a pleasant estate on the Hudson River.
It was approached by a narrow lana
from the street, says a writer in the
Springtield Republican, and was four
miles out from the City Hall on tha
Harlem road.
; The ground from the house on ona
side sloped down to the river; on tha
other was a garden Â¦which bore fruit,
accessible to boys. On Sunday, their
day of freedom as well as Mr. Gree
ley's, the boys sought the orchard.
Mr. Greeley never saw or heard them.
But Mrs. Greeley always saw them, and
from her place on the piazza she would
call to Mr. Greeley to put on his hat
and "deal with them."
Fair Warning.
The appeal says: "In many parts of Ireland, especially
those known as the 'congested districts,' no provision
is made for nursing the sick poor in their own homes.
The population is purely agricultural and acutely pover
ty stricken and the boards of guardians in these dis
tricts cannot supply even the ordinary maternity nurses.
The people assist one another, the poor supporting the
destitute; but a rate in aid of the nursing fund cannot
be levied in this district, for that would merely be tax
ing the already overburdened population in one direc
tion to benefit them in another. Moreover, as there are
seldom any resident gentry or well-to-do inhabitants of
the middle classes, it is equally impossible to obtain
voluntary contributions from local sources. During the
past year sufficient money has been collected to estab
lish and endow eight jubilee nurses. Four of these
have been at work some little time; four more will be so
shortly. But applications from districts equally poor
and necessitous are coming in constantly, and unless the
fund receives further assistance the answer sent to such
applications must be unfavorable." . .
Ireland is far away and we have many in our own land
who need assistance^ so that this appeal may seem to be
shifting a British .burden upon us; but still it comes in
the name of charity and compels attention even from the
indifferent. American liberality has given freely to suf
fering humanity in all lands, and Ireland has special
claims upon us by reason of work done for the ad
vancement of America by her children. We therefore
give the appeal the publicity desired. It is announced
that donations may be sent either to Lady Dudley or to
the Bank, of Ireland, marked "Lady Dudley Fund for
District Nurses."
AN appeal issued from the castle in Dublin and
signed by -Lady .Dudley asks that the attention ot
the Irish people in America be directed to a fund
which lias been established for the maintenance of dis
trict nurses in the poorest parts of Ireland, to the end
that they may give such assistance as their charity may
prompt.
IRELAND'S ,NEED.
"Somethin* to keep out the flies,
mum; somethin' to keep but the flies."
Day after day, week In and week out,
sunshine or rain, the housewives in the
Mission hear this cry from a little old
man who owns a little carpenter shop
on Castro street, near where the cars
turn. He has been there for years, and
during all that time he has done noth
ing but make screen-covered cupboards
â "something to keep out the flies." Oc
casionally he jwlll take an order for a
screen door.
An order for a cupboard pleases him
greatly and is always received with a
chuckle and a muttered something
about files, "the pesky critters."
Recently a woman who ordered a
cupboard from him sought to find out
why he had such a hatred for files.
For a time all she got from the old man
was a mumbled "Keep 'em out, the
pesky critters â keep 'em out."
She persisted in the inquiry, and after
a minute or tw,o the old man, with a
savage look in his eyes, snapped out:
"Twenty years ago in Missouri I had
a wife and five children. "We had a nice
little farm. In a town five miles from
us there was a plague. The files car
ried it to my little farm. "Within a week
wife and little ones died. Keep "em 014,
the pesky critters; keep 'em out."
"Keep Out the Flies."

The carriers are made of thin steel.
They are cylinders closed at one end
The boy who uses a putty blower
illustrates th? principle on which the
pneumatic tube eystem operates. The
boy expels air with a puff â the air car
ries with it the ball of putty. The air
actually flows through the pneumatic
tube. It is not "puffed" through how
ever, but is forced through the pipe.
The tubular steel carrier, slightly
smaller than the inside diameter of the
tube, is carried along by the. air cur
rent until It reaches the point of deliv
ery. An air compressor forces the pipe
and the same air current brings the
carrier back to Its original starting
point through the return tube.
The tubes are cast-iron pipes, closely
resembling water or gas pipes, but the
shell Is thicker and the quality of Iron
is better. Each twelve-foot length of
pipe is bored; to a true cylinder and
particular ,care is taken to make all
joints oir.'tight. -For short bends seam
less brass tubing is . used somewhat
larger In bore than the ;cast-lron rpipe,'
for allowance must be made for 'dear-'
ance so that the carriers will not' stick
â¢while shooting around a bend. :
But the first serious attempt to in
stsJl a pneumatic tube system for car
rying the mails was successfully made
in Philadelphia in 1832. the tubes being
six and one-eight inches inside diame
ter. Boston and Xevv York followed
T.-ith eight-inch pipes. Thus the Post
office Department set the example,
which is certain to be followed by ths
commercial world.
At first blush it would seem that this
proposition to fill an eight-Inch pipe
Â¦with air at a pressure of twenty-five
pounds more or less to the square inch.'
the said pipe reaching from Chicago
to salt water, was ene of those vision
ary schemes which pop up every week
or so. But these are days of big things,
and the building of a compressed air
pipe line between Chicago and New
York would be but the extension of a
system already In operation. Pneu
matic engineers assert there is nothing
mechanically or constructively against
the proposition; It all comes down to
the matter of money.
Those who look upon pneumatic
tubes and _ the employment of com
pressed air to carry cylindrical boxes
through pipes as something very mod
ern will be surprised to learn that half
a century ago a pneumatic tube was
put In operation in London for dis
patching telegrams.- It was only an
linch and a quarter pipe, 700 feet long,
but it worked so well that a few years
later another tube two and a quarter
inches in diameter and over 3000 feet
long was laid down. From this begin
ning sprang London's present network
of tubes, which covers the business
part of the metropolis, cc-nnectlng the
general postoffice v.ith all the subpost
offices. Berlin has over forty miles of
pneumatic tubes, but all the pipes of
the European system are of small
diameter, none exceeding three inches.
This limits them to the transmission of
telegrams and messages. In many
American cities small sized tubes have
been used for many years for carrying
messages; newspapers have used them
for the transmission of press telegrams.
The projectors of the New York-Chi
cago pneumatic tube system are not
figuring on any 100-mile-an-hour ser
vice. They say a speed of forty or
fifty miles an hour will be sufficient to
meet business needs, and claim there
will be no trouble to- maintain an un
interrupted service. Nor is it their pur
pose to run a bee line between the ter
minal cities so as to provide the short
est way for the steel carriers . to
travel through the cast-iron pipes.
The scheme contemplates a route
which will take in as many large cen
ters of population as possible without
straying too far from a practical di
rect line. This route would follow the
Hudson River and Erie canal to Buffa
lo, and parallel the Lake Shore road
to Chicago. Every city of any consid
erable population en the line would be
an Intermediate station, with relays
and power plants at necessary points.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Ntw York and Chicago will be con
&Â«ct*6 by an eight-Inch pneumatic tube
If present plane of capitalists and com

echetre Is declared to be practical and
the odd feature of the proposition is
that the projectors are not looking to
Uncle Sam for a subsidy or the United
States malls as the principal source of
revenue. It Is figured out that the net
Income from the transmission of light
packages between the terminals and
Intermediate stations will be sufficient
to pay good dividends on the invest
ment. The success of the pneumatic
tube systems for the transmission of
mall matter in New York. Boston and
Philadelphia and the dispatch of mes
sages in London, Paris, Berlin. Vienna
and Brussels Is cited to prove the prac
ticability and actual economy of com
pressed air as a carrying agent. Chi
cago is to be equipped with pneumatic
tubes for the use of its postoffices, and
pneumatic engineers look forward to an
early day when all the large cities of
the country will use the swift service
to facilitate the distribution of mails
and packages.

The fire of partisan criticism has been centered upon
him, from that black day in Buffalo when he took the
oath of office over the dead body of his chief and prede
cessor to this moment. But it has not deflected him
from his purpose, to serve the people by giving his best
and bravest in their interest, nor has it reduced the
hopeful buoyancy of his spirits or put acerbity and re
venge into his conduct toward those who oppose him.
He has accepted it like a philosopher as the lot of those
who serve the people, and thoughtful men have seen in
it merely the involuntary admission 1 of the value of his
This seems to us a fair traverse of the President's re
cord and a just statement of the influence he has exerted
upon the affairs of his country. It remains for the open
or covert supporters of Mr. v Hearst to make the com
parison. Will they do it?
With his physical strength soundly built up he re
turned to New York and entered politics, and without
the assistance of any machine was elected to the Legis
lature, where his voice and vote were given to clean poli
tics and the promotion of civic righteousness. Ap
pointed to the Civil Service Commission he' discharged
the cleansing duties of that position so faultlessly as to
draw the wrath of the spoilsmen. He held that office far
into Mr. Cleveland's second administration and was in
entire accord with his civil service ideas.
While Civil Service Commissioner he was appointed
Police Commissioner of the city of New York, a posi
tion that commanded a vast variety of the highest in
terests. It was said when he accepted it that it meant
his ruin, for no man could hold it and come out clean.
He enforced the law and raised the police establishment
high out of the Tammany gutter. Leaving that office for
the position of Assistant Secretary of the Navy, he was
an efficient force in the preparations necessary for the
Spanish war, and resigned to recruit a regiment with
which he served during that short struggle.
As a soldier he shirked no duty and avoided, no dan
ger. He exposed himself to the risks war and the
perils of death, and the test of his conduct is the love
and admiration of the men in his regiment. When that
war was over he. became the candidate of his party for
the office of Governor of. New York, and won in as hard
a political battle as has ever been fought in an American
State. As Governor he lived up to his -principles of re
form and did not hesitate to oppose the Legislature of
his own party when it showed signs of partaking of the
political demoralization with which Tammany has in
fected the politics of that State. He promoted legislation
to control trusts, to economize government and to secure
the public welfare. â¢
Next he was elected to the Vice Presidenc3% and after
the assassination of McKinley succeeded to that great
office. In the Presidency he has manifested the same
traits that characterized him in every position he has
occupied from his youth up. Devoted to the interests of
his country, he has been a man of action in every emer
gency. Corrupt elements in his party have felt the
weight of his hand whenever the duties of his office re
quired that it be laid upon them. Endowed with moral
and physical courage, he has shown both in every crisis
and no act of cowardice or demagogy is on record to his
discredit.
In the midst of all this public activity he has exhibited
constant intellectual activity and power. His work as an
author has commanded respect at home and abroad. It
has been, aimed in his various books to encourage the
manhood and .raise the ideals of his countrymen. His
historical work, like his "Winning of the West," is of
distinct value, and is an important contribution to his
torical lore. and literature. Some may object to his ex
pressions of opinion, but none can deny to them either
honesty or courage.
His books and his speeches are promotive of domestic
purity and decency, Tightness of public and private con
duct, brotherly love among men, helpfulness to those un
avoidably unfortunate, and patriotic devotion to country.
Men who have had close contact with him in Washing
ton and who oppose him political^', like the Washing
ton editor of the New York Post, make high ascription
to his qualities as a man, an American and a President.
His personal life has been clean and stainless. His pub
lic life has been frank, open and devoted, as he sees his
duty, to the honor and glory of his country. Meanness
and greed get no encouragement in the record he has
made. Indecency gets no strength in his example. Class
hatred has no impulse in his insistence upon the equality
of all men before the law.
THE Colus'a Snu. which is easily the leader of the
country Democratic press of California, is prepar
ing itself and those whom it leads to fall in with
the Hearst column. This is being done by insisting that
Roosevelt is no better, by the record, than Hearst. In
a late issue the Sun says: "Neither of them is the right
class of man for the high office. If these two should be
the nominees it would require a vast amount of check in
the kettle to call the pot black."
While that is a poor sort of politics it is probably the
best that the Sun has in stock in view of what it evi-
The record of Theodore Roosevelt has no secret
chapters. It has been an open book, and we invite those
who make the pot and kettle argument to examine it and
make the obvious comparison. Theodore Roosevelt's
father was not a millionaire, but was a man in rather
moderate circumstances. In his childhood the Presi
dent was handicapped by a weakly physique, but he mas
tered that disadvantage by the force of his will. He
graduated at Harvard, and, dependent on his own re
sources, sought the West as a field for business and ad
venture and did all the rugged work of a cattleman in
Dakota.
"Next morning when he entered the
courtroom and walked up to the table
the umbrella was there Just where he
had left it. Addressing the Judge so
that those in the courtroom could hear
him, he said: 'This little . isode proves
that it Is not impossible to find honest
men in this world. Just look, your
Honor; there is my umbrella In the
exact spot where I left It yesterday.' "
A discussion started i In the Hall of
Justice one rainy day recently as to
whether it was a crime to steal an
umbrella, and Sergeant McDonald told
a good story about the well !:nown at
torney, T. C. Van Ness.
"Attorney Van Ness," he said, "was
interested in a case in Judge Rix's
court and^when he reacned the table
In front of the bench he placed his
umbrella on It. He left the courtroom
without the umbrella, but returned lat

Pneumatic tubes, in recent years,
have become important features in re
tail stores, taking the place of cash
boys. They are used in the grain ele
vators for lifting corn, wheat and
oats, and in sawmills and furniture fac
tories to carry off the sawdust and
other refuse. They are common to
newspaper offices, and thousands of
miles of railroad tracks are paralleled
by the pipes which contain the com
pressed air that operates the automatic
block signals. Their use is extending
rapidly and there seems to be. little
doubt that in . a few years they will
be used to' carry not only mall and
telegrams, but bulky packages to all
parts of large cities.
Carriers can be sent to intermediate
stations, where an ingenius device au
tomatically switches from . the main
line only such receivers as are destined
for that station. A small metal disk on
one end of a carrier determines whether
the carrier will be switched aside from
the main line. In the bottom of the re
ceiving tube, at the Intermediate sta
tion, are two needles. If the disk is
wide enough to span the space be
tween the two needles an electrical
connection is established, the switch
is opened and the carrier is dis
charged into the receiver of the inter
mediate station. The spacing between
the needles varies for each switch so it
is only necessary to attach a disk of
the proper diameter to a carrier to send
it automatically to the desired station.
To prevent operators from choking the
tube by transmitting carriers too rap
idly, a time lock is placed on the send
ing apparatus allowing five, ten or fif
teen seconds' headway as may be de
sired.
â¢ * â¢
At each station of a pneumatic tube
line, whether a terminal or an inter
mediate station, is an apparatus for
sending and receiving carriers. The de
vice is so arranged and managed that
there is no break in the current of air
while the carrier is being pushed Into
the main tube. A frame carries two
sections of tubing. When at rest one
section forms part of the main tube.
The carrier is thrust into the open tube,
an air motor governed by a starting
lever swings the frame until the sec
tion containing the carrier comes to po
sition, forming part of the main tube;
the air immediately drives the carrier
into the main tube and swiftly trans
ports it to the other terminal. When
the carrier arrives at a station it
shoots into a closed receiver, and, com
pressing the air, forms an air cushion
so that it comes to rest without a
shock. This closed receiver then tips
down, discharging the carrier, and then
automatically returns to its original
position ready to catch the following
receiver.
The company which installed the
pneumatic transmission service in Phil
adelphia had 5n mind the expansion of
the service tu adapt it to commercial
uses. In order to determine the best
size of tube for carrying miscellaneous
bundles and packages of retailed mer
chandise a series of tests were made.
The ingenious method of measuring
bundles by passing them through hoops
of iron was adopted. Men were sta
tioned In several large department
stores where all packages and bundles
for delivery were carried out. Every
bundle was put through rings and it
was ascertained that 81 per cent of all
packages and bundles could be packed
in a 12-lnch carrier, about 10 per cent
less could go in a 10-inch carrier and
60 per cent In an 8-inch carrier. It was
demonstrated that a large proportion
of the bundles too large to be sent
through a 12-inch tube could be re
wrapped so as to permit their passage
through an 8-inch tube.
and provided with a hinged lid, which
can be Quickly and securely locked at
the other end. For an eight-Inch tube
the carrier Is two feet long and seven
inches in diameter, and weighs empty
about thirteen pounds. The steel shell
of the carrier never touches the pneu
matic tube, for on each carrier are two
collars made of woven cotton cloth,
tightly clamped between metal rings.
These collars when new fit the pneu
matic tube snugly, but use wears them
down until sometimes they are a quar
ter of an inch smaller than the diame
ter of the tube. One would think that
this would permit so much air to es
cape past the collars that the carrier
would lose speed, but as a matter of
fact this affects their velocity but
slightly. The collars are good for about
2000 miles of travel. Then they are re
newed. The empty carrier weighs
about thirteen pounds, and Its carrying
capacity is somewhat over 800 cubic
inches. Apparently it makes no differ
ence so far as speed in transit is con
cerned whether the carrier is empty or
full. The builders of pneumatic tube
systems claim that a carrier filled with
brick or lead' will -shoot through the
tube* as swiftly and certainly as one
filled with feathers.

IX MANY SECTIONS.
SALES IX VARIETY.
Several large sales of city realty are
Just reported. The tranctions of ! the
week just closed have been satisfactory
from every point of view. The brisk
inquiry for home sites shows no abate
ment. The search for Income, paying
properties is very strong and persist
ent. . There is no lack of business in
the auction rooms.
The sections known as outside lands
are getting a great deal of attention.
Easy of access to the business portions
of the city and situated near the at
tractions that are supplied by Golden
Gate Park and proximity to the ocean
beach, the outside lands are settling
up at a rate that will soon deprive' them
of any reason to be considered as "out
side" of .the activities of this growing
city, which is' forging ahead daily.
Sorr.e of the larger deals which are
just reported are evidence of the con
dition of the market and of the general
advancement of values that has taken
place In the last two or three years.

Richmond district, where Lyon & Hoag have
made large sales for thÂ« Bay District Land

tion. â¢ Major Bean was in the class of
'86 at West Point, and leaving there
went into the Second Cavalry, which
was then stationed at the Presidio. He
at once took a prominent position at
the post and became a shining light in
social affairs. lie was fond of club life
and spent much of his leisure time in
the Pacific-Union Club, of which he
was a member. He was a bright, dash
ing, intellectual and brilliant, officer.
He took a great interest in all
public questions and national af
fairs. He interested himself to
a large extent in the Balboa boulevard
scheme. In 1889 he was ordered to Har
rlsburg, Pa., where he was at once'ap
pointed to the Governor's staff. When
the Johnstown flood occurred he- was
sent to that place In charge of troops
to assist the sufferers. In 1900 he went
to the Prilippines, being then in the
subsistence department. He remained
there two years, and on his return spent
some , time in San Francisco renewing
old acquaintances. At the time of his
death he was chief commissary of the
Department of the Missouri, with head
quarters at .Omaha. A few years ago
he married one of the belles of Phila
delphia, and the marriage is reported
to have been happy in every way. He
was the son of Colonel Bean, who was
on the staff of General Merritt during
the Civil War and who, like his son,
took his own life several years ago.
The Philippine scouts are attracting a
great deal of attention at the PresMio.
Although there was no drill yesterday
the camp on the hill where they are
stationed was visited by a large num
ber of town people, who evinced great
interest in the doings of the little brown
strangers. What strikes the onlooker*
forcibly is Â¦ the uniformity of stfze and
the great"similarity in complexion. The
band came in for a great deal of praise,
and while they only succeeded in ren
dering a small portion of their pro
gramme, owlng^ to the storm which j
suddenly broke. In upon them, when i
they didsplay they brought out unllm- I
ited enthusiasm from the listeners. â¢
They will drill Monday on the parade i
grounds In front of the general hos
pital between 3 and 4 o'clock, and at 5 !

sharp the masks were removed. Music
was furnished by members of the
Musicians* Union of this city.
When the case was called and the
prisoner was asked If he had .any
thing to say why sentence should not
be passed upon hlfn Attorney Alford
replied that there was no legal cause
at that time to show why the judg
ment of the court should not be pro
nounQed, but he had a request to
make. On behalf of the prisoner's
mother and sisters he would ask that
he be sent to San Quentin instead of
Folsom, so that they would have the
opportunity of visiting him from time
to time.
The Judge complied with the re
quest In passing sentence. Attorney
Roche then asked for a stay of twen
ty days. He said the prisoner's moth
er had met with a serious accident on
the day the verdict was rendered
against him and the stay was asked
so that she might be able to see.him
before he was sent to San Quentin.
The Judge granted the stay.
The crime for which the prisoner
was sentenced , was a, cold-blooded
murder. He had been paying his ad
dresses to Miss Jordan, but she had
asked him to stop calling upon her.
On the day of the murder he. met her
as she was on her way.. home to lunch,
walked with her to her mother's res
idence, opened the gate for her and
deliberately shot her dead. Even as
she lay on the ground, after being
shot three times," he fired another bul
let into her body. Then he turned
the revolver on himself, inflicting a se
rious wound. At the trial a strong
effort was made to show "that he .was
temporarily insane at the time of the
shooting and the jury compromised by
convicting him of murder in the first
degree, with the penalty of imprison
ment for life. * i
Sentence of imprisonment for the
term of his natural life was passed
upon Edmond de Labrousse by Judge
Dunne yesterday for the murder of

1903. While sentence was being pass
ed upon him the prisoner stood In the
dock with bowed head and seemed
thoroughly resigned to his fate.

Rev. Father V. L. O'Daniels and the

the paper had been read and without

The attempt to shut off discussion,
however, was quickly stopped by

CALLS HEARST TRAITOR.
Judge Maguire then spoke briefly.
Such a statement as a man still smart
ing under hia wounds could make was
made by the Judge, but it was ; far
from what Field Marshal Tarpey had
planned } for. " Said Magxrire :

Tarpey closed with . a burst of
prophecy that made the wise ones
snicker.- "Ninety- per cent of all the
Democrats in California are for
Hearst,"- he said, and then subsided,
while a' few of the* most hardened ol
the elect clapped their hands to show
their appreciation.
cf May as the date for the convention
the call wa.3 adopted. It reads .as fol
lows:

TARPEY TO THE RESCUE.
Then up rose Tarpey â M. F. Tarpey
bf Alameda, grand marshal of the
Hearst cohorts in California. Smooth
and suave was Tarpey, .pouring oil on
the troubled waters of the committee?.
But all he., could.. say was "that .-pally
his idol and chief had'not been hos
tile to Judge Maguire's candidacy lor
Governor. "Why," said Tarpey, "Mr.
Hearst came to me personally during
that campaign and made many sug

Then- Tarpey -forgot that it is not

neither "aye" nor "no." Ed E. Leake
said afterward that some who had
promised to stand by him and vote
against the resolutions got ccld feet.
The rest was easy. Audible sighs of
relief were heard all over the room
when Chairman Murphy announced the
result of the vote, and then the com
mittee eagerly rushed through the re
mainder of the business.
W. H. Alford secured the adaption or
a vote of thanks to General R. Â«. War
field of the California Hotel for his
hospitality in giving gratis the use of
rooms at the hotel for the headquarters
of the State committee.
The secretary then began reading the
call for the State convention, bat as
the majority were anxious to get out
doors and find relief from the recent
strenuous period of chastisement at the

treasons to California Democracy.
When he took his : seat there wa3 a
moment's silence, as if the wind had
been knocked out of the Hearst boom
ers.: Then, the mover of the resolu
tions, Caminetti of Amador. got on hia
feet and tried to reply to Leake's ob
jection that the proposed action wrs
without precedent. ' "Don't yo>i know
that this is the first time California
has had such a glorious opportunity?"
he asked. "Xever before has there
been a possibility of â¢ this State secur
ing the first place on the nationil
ticket for one of her native sons."
: "This should not be done in th's.
committee," retorted Donzel Stoner of
San Francisco. "We are arrogating to |
ourselves powers we do not possess j
and should not attempt to assert." |
who were running Mr. Hearst's paper refused
to publish my reply. But I held the editors
of the paper responsible for that and never
felt that Mr. Hearst was to blame. So far as
I knoT-, his course toward me was ever
friendly. I do not want to be understood aj
criticising him.
PROGRAMME ADOPTED.
The Judge's ideas regarding Hearst's
lack of responsibility for the misdeeds
of hfs newspaper set the whole commit
tee in a broad grin. He was followed
hy Ben F. Gelss of Willows, who said
that any action by the committee
would be merely a personal 'expression
of "our individual opinions." and that
Hearst had done a great many things
the speaker could not stand for. Then,
with delightful inconsistency, he. went
on to demand the passage of the reso
lutions. 'Ton cannot expect a man to
have all the virtues," said Geiss. and
the committee decided to let It go at
that. The resolutions" were adopted by
a substantial majority* of the voices
heard, but many of the members said
Let the people have a voice. If they want
Hearst, all right. I shall bow In aubmisstcn
to their will, - but what right has this com
mittee, appointed to conduct the campaign of
Franklin K. Lane, . to ; dictate to the coming
State convention the indorsement ot the man
who fought and defeated Lane?- I know teo>
well that I may not Influence.* vote here, but
none the less am I. bound In honor and â¢ Con
science to l register this protest, against - the
wrong you have 'planned, to. inflict span the
Democratic : party In California. _Â¦;.;
GIVE PEOPLE A VOICE.
Have you seen anything In ' th* Examiner
lately regarding Mr. Bell, one cf the greatest
of California Democrats?
This man" Hearst fonght Bearaer when that
sterling -Democrat was a candidate for the
State Board of Equalization, demanding that
Ileamer'sinarae Â»be dropped .from our ticket
and that or a Populist put on. I would op
pose my own brother or my best friend If he
had proved a -traitor to> such tried and true
Democrats as these.
Mr, Chairman, this ia no personal tight on
my part. I have no animosity asainrt Hearst
that I should not gladly subordinate to the
welfare of the party. I am here to discharge
a debt of honor to tfte- great man whom I
have named and whcni Hearst bÂ«>trayed.
-Jvow I want to ask how do>s San Francisco
get nearly a fourth of all the votes In the
apportionment which has been prepared by
thÂ« secretary ? Let me tell you. . It U the re
sult of a vote cast In thÂ»Â» city at the last
jrobematorial election for FranV-fln K. Lane.
But Lane set that rote in <nlte.of all. th"
Examiner and its owner could do to injure
him. Hearst did succeed Jn electing a. Re
publican Governor, and _now-_ you are going
to reward him. for Eis treason by demanding
that th* Democrats of the United Statas'shaU
march through the coming campaign with this
traitor as their ! standard bearer. Gentlemen.
thev*H.nevÂ«r do It- -'â¢ â¢ . â¢ ..---.;
Four years ago, at the State Â¦ convention,
StÂ»phen M. White was vhairman of the com
mittee on resolutions. The committee's re
port had been prepared and was ready for
submission to the convention when a reso
lution was sprung demanding' that the Demo
cratic National Convention should give th*<
Vice Presidential nomination to Hearst. By
all that was Just, by all that was honest.
If California was to have a representation on
the national ticket, that place was due to
White himself, the jrreat leader of our party.
He knew it. Moreover he could not forget
Hearst's treachery to him. Leanlns over to
me he said â and I well remember his words,
for they were the tawt I ever heard from the
lips of StepbÂ«n M. White:
. "Kill that resolution if you can, Leake. ir
you cannot I snail have to^ go on the "floor ot
the convention and fight it-"
This was White's cplnioc of the Democracy

Democrats of thi* State and nation shall select

Australian Mine S900 Feet Deep.
What is believed to be the deepest
gold mine in the world is bein* work
ed at Bendigo, Australia. The mine
In question, which is /jailed the New
Chum Railway mine, has sunk its
main shaft to a. depth of ; 3000 feet
or only sixty feet short of three-quar
ters of a mile. The chief Droblem is
how to keep the tunnels and geneVal
workings cool enough for the miners
to work in at* such a depth. It is
usually about 108 degrees and, to en
able the men* to work at all, -a spray
of cold , water let down from : above
has to be kept continually playing on
the bodiesâ^naked from the waist
upwardâ of the miners. Even then
they cannot .work hard/or, they would
faint from exhaustion^â Leisure Hour.
" 'That,* said the actor with great
dignity, 'is the one to which I refer.' "-

"Talk with a Democrat up my way,"
said Hugo A. Gilmartin, the story teller
from-IJfitrolt, "and he will constantly
come harping back on one thingâ the
tariff. Reminds me of the time I was
in a hotel up In Saginaw. A theatrical
company had gone on the rocks and the
leading man had been living a precari
ous life at this hotel waiting for re
mittances. One morning he rang tha
bell in his room for half an hour. ' No
body answered. Then he went out in
the hall, leaned, over the railing and
said: 'Boy! Ho, b-o-y!'
"'What is it?' snarlea the bellboy
from the lobby beneath. \
'"Have you seen anything of my
laundry?'
"'Aw, g'wan,' said the boy. 'You
ain't bad but one shirt since you've
been here.'

New Orleans Race Results.
Misty's Pride, the Oregon flier, up
set an awful good thing in the fifth
race of the day. After twice defeat
ing Hainault, Oeyrohe, with only
ninety-five pounds up, looked like
something tart and spicy from the
can. Accordingly all the smart ones
got aboard at 9 to 5. Travers, astride
Misty's Pride, gave his field the slip
at the start, and, while Crosswaite
made up considerable ground with the
favorite, the Oregon mare reached the
wire first by three open lengths. Le
tola got away poorly and was never a
factor, the show honors going to
Charley McCaffetry's The Hawaiian.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Jack Martin had the honor of riding
both the stake and the handicap win
ners.
John Bullman is carded to leave for
New oYrk to-day. It is understood he
will ride in the colors of August Bel
mont again the coming season.
M. J. Daly finally secured a car, and
Claude and most of his other horses left
for Memphis last night. Johnny Daly,
of course, went along, as he will pilot
Claude in the Montgomery handicap.

popular Denver turfman, is getting to
gether quiet a stable. He now has To

cashed their tickets all right, but at
one stage of the running could un
questionably feel the cold shivers
stealing over them. Ridden by C.
Smith and played down to 9 to 10,
Mr. Farnum went out in the lead as
in his preceding race.
He opened up quite an extensive
gap going the first half-mile, but in
the stretch was under forced draught
all the way and then only beat The
Fretter a length, Smith resorting to
questionable tactics to accomplish
same. The latter horse was carried
wide in the run to the stand, but owing
to the muddy condition of the track
Travers' claim of foul was not allowed.
Fille d'Or took the show from Mr.
Dingle.

Rio Shannon Beats
Sailor Knot for
the Place.
The grizzled turf veteran sneers at
our sprinters of to-day as wouM a
Vermont larmcr if given -i piece of
KocQuefort cheese to munch with his
r.pple pie.
He loves to tell of the deed-j per
lormed a decade ago by cuch equine
giants cf renown as Norfolk. Lodi,
Thad Stevens. True Blue. Ivaty Pease
and Hock Hocking. When three four
mile heats were reeled off under .tha ;
sun's rays of the afternoon and the \
fourth and deciding one at dusk, af-j
ter supper had been partaken of.
Apparently these golden memories
of the past survive jand are cherished
to a certain extent by the present gen
eration of the far Western country.
Orf of the largest Saturday crowds cf
the season saw the tenth renewal of
the Thornton stake run at Oakland
tr2ik yesterday, despite the unpropi
tion* r.eather.
The course was a perfect sea of
mud, but the rain held aloof until th 1 ? I
hcrses had completed their four-mile j
tiamp, then the skies broke loose with
*â¢ frefh supply of wet goods. Hora
tue was an absentee and this left but
foar, Veterano, Rio Shannon, .SaiJor
Kr,ot and The Way, to go for the val
uable prize, of which the winner's
-hare was J2CC0.
HORATIUS IS DRAWN.
With Horatius nibbling hay in h's
stall. Veterano, owned by Walt Vivell
and the mount of Jack Martin, was
the talent's selection and a pro
nounced favorite. He won and so de- j
cisively as to leave no room for doubt
but that he was the best horse.
Mike Daly sent his three-year-old
Sailor Knot, a forlorn hope, to the
post and the colt ruled second choice.
For a bit over three miles Willie Daly,
on Saiior Knot, which was shoulder
ing but S6 pounds under the condi- !
lions of the race, shaped up the pace |
for the favorite on sufferance. Then
Martin assumed the leading position
with Veterano and it ceased longer to
be a contest, the first choice winning
pricking his ears and nodding In 7:37.
Twenty lengths in his wake came Rio
Shannon, which Willie See had ridden
into second position, and forty lengths
farther away Sailor Knot wobbled in
third. Soon after the start Moun
tain's saddle on The Way slipped and
;'Â«jr two and three-quarters miles he I
per severed, perched on the horse's j
neck, finally being obliged to pull up.
OVATION' VOn VTJTKUAXO.
On his return to the stand, the win
ner received the usual ovation and I
looking but slightly distressed, sub- j
mltted with good grace to having the i
prreat Coral horseshoe placed about his
neck. ' Jack Martin, too, was applaud
ed for bis cool and clever piloting: of
the favorite.
Veterano is a bay horse four years
old by Rey El Santa Anita-Orange
Leaf and was bred by E. J. Baldwin.
AlÂ»out one year ago he was disposed of
by Jimmy Coffey, owner of Rio Shan
non, for 5500, Walt Vivell being the
purchaser.
Throughout the afternoon the horses
ran true to form and the ring quit big
loser. Four first .choices, as usual and
a third chance were the purse winners.
Matt Hogan, Veterano and Arabo were
especially well supported.
, So brisk was speculation on the prob
able outcome of the 51000 handicap over
one mile and seventy yards, for which
a field of eight contested, that there
vriLs no actual favorite. Every horse
starting appeared to have friends, with
Arabo and Modicum finally settling
down as the crowd's pick, each being
held at 4 1-2. Dick Dwyer sent the
bunch away nicely aligned, with Jack
Martin quickly showing first on the
Jennings horse Arabo. The big chest
nut fairly reveled in the going, and
after shaking: oft Kenilworth and
Ocean Dream, held Warte KIcht up his
6!eeve, winning by three lengths.
Bonner. on G. W. Trahern, finished a
good third. Modicum at one time

CHICAGO, March 19. â With 1602
nominations for the twelve stakes of
the 1904 s.eason, the Harlem Jockey
Club officials claim to have established
a new record for the number of en
tries to racing features of this class.
The chief Increase is in the events for
the three-year-olds and two-year-olds
and is said to carry corresponding bet
terment of class. Of the big stakes,
the $15,000 Harlem Xational handi
cap has 112 entries and the Twentieth
Century 118 and the Lewis and Clark
stakes, regarded as a tryout for the
American Derby, has 97 entries.
Heavy Entry for Harlem Stakes.
The brave spirits of the California
Polo and Pony Racing Association
were again unfortunate yesterday in
the class of weather under which their
races were run at Tanforan. A blus
tering wind. blew over the course. In
the last race the horses could not be
distinguished at the post in the driv
ing rain.
The inclement weather was the only
drawback, the sport being of the high
est class. The finishes were close and
exciting and the time fast. With 150
pounds jup "W. E. Pedley's Carlotta, a
thoroughbred in miniature, ran a half
mile in 61 1-2 seconds in the mud.
The surprise of the day and appar
ently the most popular victory was the
success of Rudolph Spreckels' Lotrix.
piloted by Frank Skinner, in the mile
race. Carlotta was the only other con
tender and, having had a two-hours'
rest after the half-mile race, was
looked upon as a sure winner. She
commenced to hang out signals of dis
tress at the half-mile pole. Entering
the stretch Lotrix, which is a daughter
of Bright Phoebus, assumed the lead
and won. easily by two and one-half
lengths. i
The honors of the day were equally
divided among three stables. W. E.
Pedley won two . races with Carlotta
and Queen Rucker; R. and W. A. Mc-
Creery won two with their chestnut
pony. Sunset, while the cerise, green
fleur de lis of Rudolph Spreckels was
carried successfully by Peghome and
Lotrix.
F. D. Hudson, the Southern Califor
nia rider, and W. A. McCreery each
piloted two winners, while R. M.
Tobin and Franjt Skinner each had
one victory to their credit.
The only accident of the day oc
curred in the first race, when W. A.
McCreery's chestnut mare Mamie
threw herself over backward. Her
owner, who had the mount, was not
injured and pluckily remounted and
rode out the race, finishing second to
Carlotta by three-quarters of a length.
When the mare was pulled up she
threw herself again without Injuring
her rider.
* Mr. McCreery came out on Sunset
in the second race at three-sixteenths
of a mile and won handily from Flo
radora.
R. M. Tobln landed Peghome first at
the wire in the three-eighths-mile race
following. .Maudie Swift, a promising
green pony in whose veins flows the
blood of El Rio Rey, finished second.
Maud H. the smallest pony racing at
the meeting, found the quarter-mile
two far for her. She showed in' front
for a time, but was passed in the last
furlong by Queen Rucker, which won
easily.

Following are the day's results, with
Judge Thomas Tierney's official scores:
The rundown of the open stake at In
gleside coursing park yesterday pro
duced some surprises that set the talent
on the verge of collapse. The first un
pleasant feeling that caused the wi*e
ones to look glum was when Jigamoroo,
a 5 to 1 shot, bent out Silver Cloud In
a close trial. Lily York soon followed,
and after an undecided cours* ran
away from Spotless Beauty, a 1 to 7
choice and a strong stake favorita.
Then came Fairy Belle's victory over
Equator and Aurella's defeat of Idaho
Boy, both at 4 to L Then in quick or
der Clover Blossom, at '5 to 1. took tlwr
flag from Firm Fellow, and Prome
theus, at 4 to 1, secured the decision
over Apple Blossom with a clean score.
Full Moon and Presidio Boy com* to
gether in the first round to-day, and
the winner of the course stands 'well In
line for final honors. Rector la also
there, and with Young Fearless, Reck-
Iesa Acrobat and the green one, Prin
cess Savoy, the day's coursing should
be one of the first order.
Hildebrand returned to the saddle
to-day and threw away the race on his
first mount. Wager, in the second race.
With the race won fifty yards from
the finish, he quit riding, went to
sleep and allowed Jim Gore II to nose
Wager out of first money. MacFleck
noe was third. Milas won the hurdle
handicap at a mile and an eighth. May
S was second and Waiter, the heavily
played favorite, third.
The last race, on the card went to

BILLY MOORE FIRST.
A widely circulated tip sent Im
promptu to the post favorite over Billy
Moore for the first, a seven-furlong
celling: run. The old cripple once
showed a flash of speed, then sulked,
finishing last. Travers, on the 15 to 1
shot, came -within an ace of making a
runaway affair of it. It was only
under the most vigorous sort of riding
that Bonner, on Billy Moore, got up in
time to receive a nose decision. Decoy,
for a time the runner-up, ran third.
Billy Magrane's gelding, Matt Ho
gan, captured the Futurity course
sprint following, due in a great meas
ure to Johnny Daly's handling. Matt
went to the post a 13 to 10 favorite,
raced Alice Carey into subjection and
then disposed of the late arrival.
Flaneur, by almost a length. C. Smith
on the latter was slow to leave the

WATCH THE SKIN FOR SIGNS OF BAD BLOOD.
Boils and pimples, sores, ulcers and pustular .or dry scaly skin eruptions, ate signs of'
,bad blood. When the bodily organs that nature has designed for the cleansing and purifi-
cation of the system break down or become torpid and inactive, the blood takes np the ixn-'
purities and casts them out through the pores of the skin, and a carbuncle or boil, sore or,
itching eruption of some kind is the result. The warm days of spring arouse the slnggishi
blood, the skin reacts, and the humors and poisons that have been collecting in the system-
all winter are suddenly thrown off by the blood and the pores are clogged and inflamed by
the acrid matter passing off, and the skin has strong aitd vigorous now.

A teacher at Buckport, Me., is feel
ing a bit discouraged at present. The
other day she was trying to get a bit
of knowldge into the class in arithme
tic, and one boy in particular would
do nothing that he was asked to.
Finally the teacher, in desperation,
turned on him and asked him what ha
intended to be if by any chance he -was
permitted to grow up. The youth re
plied that he thought he would be a
teacher and have his scholars do his

Young Corbett has become estranged
from his beloved gymnasium and those
ever familiar boxing gloves. It is hard
for a little scrapper like him to give
them up, yet his chief advisers will not
stand for them any more, and from
now on until the night of his battle
with Britt the featherweight champ
will have to take to the highways for
his work and his' pleasure.
Harry Tuthill, after a long analysis
of the Corbett question, finally decided
that the Denver star had quite enough
of work wi\h the mitts and the other
things that are generally found in
gyms. So he held a Consultation with
Tim McGrath and jointly they agreed
upon the' terms by which Corbett
would have to condition himself within
the remaining few days. i 'â¢Â¦,".-
When the little man awoke yester
day morning and â partook of a sub-,
stantlal breakfast, he was sent out for
his usual run, though the rain was
coming down faster than . Pat Mor
rlssey ever galT&ped through the -home
stretch. He was game and went the
distance in good time, arriving in- due
season for the rubdown and the
luncheon he enjoys. Â¦
The . remainder: of the midday . was
spent in a few games of bridge and a
loll around the place. Although'. the
weather was extra juicy, a big crowd
gathered at the tavern in the^ hope of
seeing the champion go through; his
paces, and great was the disappoint-,
ment when it was given out that noth-,
ing would be doing.
When the clock struck the hour of
three, the champ took to the Ingleslde
road while â¢ the, rain was breaking
through the' heavens" so fast that, ho
one could tell just what the speed limit
was. He was attired in a. leathern
coat, two extra suits of underclothes
and shoes' that 'were guaranteed: to be
just the' things for such ; a "storm.
He went the eight miles and 'return
in good time and came , back, all in a
glow. , Then he was treated to a whole

ready ; tor}, any; kind of a good-looking
meal that "might be passed -\ but. Â¦ ' This

off the three pounds - that have kept
him above the contract weight for ten
days past. This extra avoirdupois will
not be removed in a day, nor, in three
days, . but will be 'separated from

A Philadelphian recently on a tour
of the world .passed nearly a month in
Korea and gives this summary of the
military and navaV resources of "the
land of the morning calm." . "I was
amused," he said, "by the serious way
in which the Korean officials spoke of
their navy. At Chemulpo I saw the
navy pass. It consisted of a single
steamer, which had formerly been a
collier, and it was armed with two
old fashioned muzzle-loading guns.
There is a regiment of Koreans in
Seoul who are being drilled by Jap
anese officers, but beyond that the
'army' consists of a rabble made up of
anywhere between fifty and a hundred
thousand men, armed with a collection
of weapons which begin with bows
and arrows, spears, pikes something
like the halberd, arquebuses and old
muzzle-loading rifles. There are a few
Mausers, and I saw one detachment
that had every variety of hunting gun
you could name. The officials are gor
geous in their uniforms, but the fileâ
a kaleidoscopic mob so far as appear
ance was concerned. The pay of the
Korean soldier is S cents a. day. â¢ The
Seoul regiment is the Emperor's royal
guard and is the only organization in
the army that shows anything like
discipline. But .the navy! That would
make you laugh."â Philadelphia Tel-

The American Inventor, reports a
new system of railway operation, de
scribed as a device for running cars
without wheels. Instead, a series of
skates or slippers are attached to the
bottom of the car; between the skates
and the rails, a thin stream of water
is forced from a jet, creating a slight
film, on whJch the car runs. It la as
serted that by this method the track
resistance is reduced, so that less run
ning power is needed; a smoother mo
tion is also secured, resulting in less
wear and tear both of the car and of
the rails. The train is run by electric
motors, operating a. friction â¢wheel,
which moves on a third rail between
the two outer rails.

John J. Heaney, a machinist, and his
â¢wife were legally divorced, â¢ and the
court awarded the custody of . their
minor child to the mother and ordered
the father to contribute $10 a month
to its support. Instead of doing so,
however, John, became an idler, and
the mother to Judge Fritz
to compel him to obey the court's de
cree. Judge. Fritz told John that if he
did not pay the woman $10 within a
week he -would be sent to Jail,' and yes
terday the money was paid. Then the
Judge advised John to make the Â¦ pay
ments as 'they became due, even
though he were compelled to work to
obtain the money.
Police Sergeant Helms accused Amos
Buffum, chauffeur, of speeding his
auto at a fifteen-mile-an-hour clip on
the south driveway of Golden Gate
Park, and Judge Fritz fined Amos $5.
Washington Stoner, an infantryman
who recently returned from the Philip
pines, was unable to explain how he
became drunk night before last, as he
had not received his pay. In dismiss-

knocking him down, she sat upon him
until the police arrived.
A white spitz dog was the bone of a
contention between two Armenians in
Judge Cabanlss 1 court. Charles Courian
alleged that he had the dog in his pos
session on Post street when Thomas H.
Kullujian emerged from his store and
snatched the animal, claiming it was
his property. As the dog was ill, Cou
rian- explained, he did not try to re
cover it by force, but had Kullujian ar
rested by Police Officer Maloney, who
witnessed the occurrence. After the
case had been exhaustively argued Kul
lujian was ordered to restore the dog
to Courian and advised to begin civil
proceedings for its recovery if he still

NEW YORK, March . 19.â Three
Standard Oil Company tugs, two fire
boats and the entire fire department of
Elizabeth, N. J., were called out early
this" morning to prevent the spread of
an oil fire which caused a loss estimated
at $200,000 and which threatened with
destruction the extensive oil works of
the Borne &.Scrymser- Company at
F.Iizabethport, N. J., and neighboring
plants and lumber yards.
The plant was partly destroyed on
tke night of February 27, causing a loss
of $75,000. The second fire began at
nearly the same hour from the
same cause â spontaneous combustion.
Spreading into the main plant, which
consists of eight or ten buildings and a
dozen big oil tanks, the fire became so
hot that the firemen could only bend
their efforts toward keeping it within

For a case of Nervous Debility, Varicocele, Rheumatism, Lame Back, Lumbago, Sciatica, any case of Kidney Disease (that has not gone as far as
Bright's Disease), Indigestion, Constipation, or any weakness which I cannot cure with my new improved Electric Belt, with electric suspensory for
men (no charge), the marvel of electricians, the most wonderful curative device that has ever been introduced.
Give me a man broken down from dissipation, hard work or worry, from any cause which has sapped his vitality. Let him follow my advice
for three months and I will make him as vigorous in every respect as any man of his age.
I will not promise to make a Hercules of a man who was never intended by nature to be strong and vigorous. Even that man I can make
better than he is; but the man who has been strong and has lost His strength I can make as good'as he ever was.
I can give back to any man what he has lost by violation of the laws of nature. I can stop all drains upon his vitality in ten days.
A man who is nervous, whose brain and body are weak, who sleeps badly, awakes more tired than when he went to bed, who is easily dis-
couraged, inclined to brood over imaginary troubles, who has lost ambition and energy to tackle hard problems, lacks the animal electricity which
the Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt supplies.
The whole force of vitality in your body is dependent upon your animal electricity. When you lose that by draining the system in any man-
ner my Belt will replace it and will cure vou.
llr. Harry U. Jackton. Valjeton, Cal., writes October 1: "AltfiouÂ«:h you are a itranger tÂ« me. my heart warm* toward you aa a treat banafaetar and friend, and X Â«n moi*
than grateful to you. Already I feel the vigor of new life In my body; no aches and no pains. I wish you every smccess In your work." ,
Letters like that tell a story which means* a great deal to a sufferer. They are a beacon light to the man who has become discouraged from
useless doctoring. I get such letters every day.
My Belt has a wonderful influence upon tired, weak nerves. It braces and invigorates them, and stirs up a great force of energy in a man.
I make the best electrical body appliance in ths world, having devoted twenty years to perfecting it. I know my trade. My cures after
everythinp: else has failed are my best arguments.
Mr. Roy Durks, HcKlttrick. Cal.. writes: "From the first nlrht I wore the belt I felt new life in every part of my body. ThÂ« weakness waa checked Immediately, and I am now
able to do heavy work without tiring. I am glad I thought of the belt, for In na other way could the money brine me so much pleasure."
Give me a man with pains in his back, a dull ache !n his muscles or joints, "come-and-go" pains in his shoulders, chest and side. Sciatica in
his hip, Lumbago, Rheumatism, or any aehe or pain, and my Belt will pour the oil of life into his aching body and drive out every sign of pain.
No pain can exist where my Belt fs worn.
Mr. J. It. Beird of Orland, Cal.. write* October 13: "My back Is entirely well,' and I would not take $100 for my belt If I could not get another. It Is thÂ« best thing en earth for
And these "old" men, these men who have burned the candle at both ends â or even if they haven't â these men -who for one reason or another
feel that life has lost its spice, that they are getting old too fast, I can make them feel the sparkle and fire of youth again.
I'll never forget when Mr. A. Crawford of Ppkegama, Oregon, an old man of seventy, wrote to me and said: "When I wrote to you last I told
you to send me a Belt to make an old man young, and you did. I am seventy years old, and since'I have worn the Belt I feel as strong as I did at
thirty-five, and can do as good a day's work as I could at that age." It was two years ago that' Mr. Crawford wrote me that letter. Here is one I
just got from him:
"In reply to your letter I am glad to say that I am Just aÂ« much In favor of your Belt aa I ever waa, for It has bÂ«en a remarkable help to me. I am eÂ«venty-two yeara Â©Id. >nt
I do net look any more, than fifty. Am enjoying perfect health, and will continue to recommend the Belt, as I have, been doing right alone, aa I realize that but for It I should hav* bÂ«ea

They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or hamlet in the country which has not cures by Dr. McLaaghhn s Electric
Belt. â¢ . -
Now, what does this mean to you, dear reader? If you are not what you ought to be, can you ask any better proof to make you try it? Is
there a remedy which is as simple, as easy to use, as sure to cure and as cheap as Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt? I have not seen one. You must
try it In justice to yourself, and to those who look to you for their 'future happiness, try it now. Act this minute. Such a matter ought not be
delayed. ' â¢
It's as good for women as for men. Worn while you sleep, it causes no trouble. You feel the gentle glowing heat from it constantly, but no
sting, no burning, as in -old-style belts. '
Come and. see me if you can. I have a private consulting room in which I will explain my method of treatment, and, perhaps, give you the
names of some of your friends whom I havÂ« cured.

not only that he had seen the .Groff.

that morning, and, recalling Wynne's

Talking one dav with me about this

"Do you know, it amazes nje that the
fruit steamers do not succeed in rid
ding New Orleans of its rat population.
They are continually carrying rats
away from New Orleans and never
bring them back, yet the rat supply in
the Crescent City always holds up un
der the strain pretty well. 1
"I was in the trade for a good many
years, and I count this curious freak of
the Louisiana rats one of the oddest
things. I have ever been cognizant of.
While the fruit steamers lie at the
New Orleans docks the rats stow them
selves away by the scores and hun
dreds. Cats are of no avail in keep-
Ing them back. I had fifteen on board
my craft once, and. they succeeded in
doing no more than keep the rodents
below deck. On the out voyage they
are one of the biggest nuisances im
aginable, but as soon as the vessel
reaches one of the Central or South
American ports they swarm ashore, as
though the Pied Piper of Hamlin were
ashore playing on the sands.
"During the return voyage ; to New
Orleans, with my vessel loaded with
luscious fruit, and. It would, be pre
sumed, far more enticing to a rat, I
have never seen one on board. They
sail out with us, but they never come
back. I don't know how to account for
it, but the statement Is true, and I
have no . doubt the captain of every
vessel in the fruit trade out of New
Orleans' has noticed it and will sub-

In the early cars a couple of fifteen
horsepower motors were thought to be
*<mple. To-day an electric locomotive
is in operation on the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad propelled by eight 225
horsepower motors, a total of 1S00
horsepower. The first cars built had a
sealing tapacity of sixteen. Sixty is
the number of passengers that can be
seated in the latest designs. In ar
rangements for long-distance trolley
lines, the Middle West States are taking
the lead. In Indiana five roads, each
over 100 miles in length, are finished or
ia course of construction.
These two inventions, the under run
ning trolley and the direct connected
motor, are perhaps the only features
in electric car designing which have
survived the contest of changes and im
provements in the equipment of elec
tric lines.
Th- year 1*04 brings us to the quarter
century mark since the Siemens Com
pany of Berlin first connected an elec
tric motor to a truck and initiated the
electric railway. The car was crude,
and the railway a small affair, Z5Q
yards long, and of three feet three
lnchÂ»s gauge, the third rail being used.
A species of sliding trolley on an over
head rail was invented two years later.
In 18S5 Van Depole invented the under
running trolley wheel, making feasible
the use of overhead wire conductors,
and Wellington Adams mounted the
motor directly on the car axle â the
practice up to that time having been
10 mount the- motor on a separate frame
and connect with the axle by chains
or belts.

On Monday in King's bench division,
before the Lord Chief Justice, Justice
Madden and Justice Wright. Judgment
was given ' in the case of Sleater vs.
Brcwsters, Limited, which had been ar
gued before the court on a case stated
by the magistrates sitting at London
derry. Defendants, who are bakers In
that city, were summoned by the plain
tiff for having on the 26th of November
last refused to sell bread by weight,
contrary to the provision of 1st and 2d
Vic., Cap. -28. Sec. 4. The magistrates
dismissed the case on the merits, but
agreed to state a case for the King's
bench division. This set out that plain
tiff had asked defendants for a 3d loaf,
the correct weight of which should, be
two iHJunds, but on weighing the loaf
which was supplied it was found to be
deficient by one ounce. Plaintiff relied
on section 4 of the act, which provided
that bread should be sold by weight
only, and notby measure,- and imposed
a penalty of 40 shillings for a-contra
vention of the provision, which referred
to ordinary household bread and ex
empted fancy. bread and -French rolls.
It was contended on plaintiff's behalf
that it was not sufficient to weigh the
dough, but that the bread should be
weighed after being fully baked, either
in presence of the purchaser or at some
time prior to sale. For defendants It
was set out that they employed a ma
chine which cut the dough into slices,
and these when baked formed two
pound and four-pound loaves, as re
quired, that the sale. of these was on
the basis of weight affd that the re
quirements of the act had been com
plied with.
The Lord Chief Justice in delivering
the unanimous Judgment of the court
said the case must go back tÂ« the mag
istrates, with a direction to convict,
and the plaintiff w^iild get his costs of
the argument. â London Exchange.

has the stoicism to withhold it from
the box office of that circus emeritus?
Besides it's distinctly good form to ex
hibit an interest in the Doctor's .Daugh
ters' philanthropy,' and it offers a. joy
ous chance to ventilate new millineryâ
and that's something.
Have you seen Â¦ the trap that a good
Samaritan gave to the Daughters, to be
raffled at $1 per chance? The trap, with
Its accouterments, is In the custody of
Mrs. Frederick Tallant and Mrs. Wake
field Baker. And if you don't use traps
there'll be a Yorkshire terrier, there
that might interest you, the gift of
Alexander Hamilton. Miss Blair holds
the tickets that will decide his future
custodian. Would you like it to be you?
There are few busier women on our
busy peninsula than the Doctor'*
Daughters these dars. The devoted D.
D.'s are . vigorously violating union
hours in their pursuit of success for
their horse show and circus March 25,
v.-orking while awake and plotting and
planning when asleep. But then it will
pay, and' pay handsomely, for note the
fact that all the boxes have been sold
these many sunsets, and not so very
many seats remain unchosen. So haste
ye, merry maids and matrons and gal
lant men folk, if you would see the
"greatest show on earth," and get your
seats In a hurry. Where? At Sherman
t Clay's or from any of the diligent
Daughters themselves.
Philanthropy is always an alluring
thing to patronize because it inflates
our modicum of self-esteem, but when
the method of philanthropy is enter
taining then It becomes a veritable Joy.
Ahd that is precisely what, the horse
show will be on that eventful night and
afternoon. -.

Miss M^Cartledge gives some
helpful advice, to yoiing girls.
Her letter is fiut one of thou-
sands which prove that nothing
is so helpful to young girls who
are just arriving at the period of
womanhood as Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound.
11 Dear Mrs. " Pdtkham : â I cannot
praise Uydia E. Pinkhain's Vege-
table Compound too highly, for it
is the only medicine I ever tried which
cured me. ' I suffered much from my
first menstrual period, I felt so weak
and dizzy at limes 1 could not pursue
iny studies with the usual interest.
My thoughts became sluggish, 1- had
headaches, backaches and sinking
spells, also pains in the back and lower .
. lixabs. I In fact, I was sick all orer. . .
11 Finally, after many other remedies
had been tried, we were advised to get
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound, and I am pleased to say
that after taking 1 it only two weeks, a
wonderful change for the better took
place, and in a short time I was in
perfect health.- I felt buoyant, full of
life, and foend all work a pastime. I
am indeed glad to tell " my experience
with Ljdia E. Pinkham's Vege-.
table Compound, for it made a dif-
ferent girl of nie. 1 Yours very truly,

Everything that Is printed In the
English language in the compilation
prepared by Director Eugene Goodwin
is also repeated' in Spanish. A list is
supplied of all the principal articles
sold by the business houses of,, San
Francisco and under each heading the
nariies of the firms dealing in the
commodities are grouped" for easy
reference. '--'â¢â¢:"â¢ >y 'Â¦Â¦'
Among the statements is one of sig
nificance relative to manufactures in
California:. "There were in 1900
12.5S2 manufacturing establishments
In the State, turning out products val
ued at $S02,S74,761, as compared with
7923 establishments producing goods
valued at $213,403,996 in 1890.vCom
petent observers estimate that in two
years the figures for 1900. haye been
increased more than 25 per cent."
Director Goodwin has invited for
eign manufacturers to take advantage
of the information gathered by the
museum relative to Pacific Coast
products or of any information of a
commercial character in regard to the
United States. He has sent out also
the information that the museum I?
a public Institution; that it is not es
tablished for private gain and neither
buys nor sells goAds, but that it acts
as an intermediary to bring buyer and
seller together and ' charges no fees
for furnishing information to foreign
buyers.
Facts and statistics relative to all
branches of industry in California ac
company the publication for the en
lightenment of foreign merchants and
foreign men of business generally, fo
that the showing is comprehensive
and educational.
The Pacific Commercial Museum
has adopted effective means to have
the commercial possibilities of San
Francisco accurately and thoroughly
understood In all countries bordering
on the Pacific Ocean. Manager Eu
gene Goodwin has prepared for circu
lation a "Trade Index of San Fran
cisco." This will be widely circulated
in foreign lands, with which this city
may directly be connected in trade.
One leadipg feature of the index is a
list of all the members of the mu
seum, several hundred mercantile
firms and manufacturing and export
ing houses. /This list is published in
both the English and Spanish lan
guages. San Francisco is described in
a general way in both of the lan->
guages mentioned and some statistics
of value are afforded.
Eugene Goodwin Compiles Facts for
the Pacific Commercial Museum

Auditor Hairy Baehr was sued yes
terday by W. J. Hudson for his salary
warrants as machinist at the corpora
tion yard for the months of November
and December of last year and Jan
uary and February of this year. He
claims that notwithstanding his war
rants have been approved by the city!
officials whose approval is necessary,
Baehr refuses to turn them over . to
him so that he can get his- money. He
asks^the court to issue a writ of man
date compelling the Auditor to give
up the warrants.
Hudson Wants Salary Warrants.
Captains Petty and Grattan of the
First Artillery and Captains Hunt and
Vanderbilt of the Fifth Infantry have
agreed to select five men from each of
their respective comman'ds, who have
made a record at the targets, for the
purpose of testing the Krag-Jorgen
sen rifles furnished to the
guard. The test will be made at the
range of Company D of the Fifth In
fantry, near San Rafael, at 200, 300
and 500 yards, with, service ammuni
tion. The marksmen will use up 1000
cartridges, which will be purchased by
the four companies, as the State has
no such ammunition to furnish for
target practice.
The last of this year's inspection in
the Fifth Infantry was held last night
at Livermore, the officers and mem
bers of Company I appearing in review
before the critics of the guard. *
The muster and inspection of Comr
pany H at Napa last week by Major
Wilhelm, U. S. A., and Colonel Koster
demonstrated that the censure of the
inspector last year, which* was to the
effect that the company had run down
to such an extent that it ought to be
disbanded, had a salutary effect.
There was an excellent showing as to
numbers, all but two or three being
present. The company also showed
marked improvement in regard to dis
cipline, soldierly bearing and attention
to the execution of military move
ments. In other words, the company
redee*med itself.
The inspections of the First Infantry
are now on, the first having been held
last Friday.
An election has been ordered for
captain for Company C, First Infantry,
to fill the vacancy caused by the ex
piration of Captain Moore's term of
service.
An election will be held in Company
F, Fifth Infantry, March 23, for a cap
tain to succeed Covalt, term expired.
Last October Major General Dick
inson, division commander of the Na
tional Guard; (?olonel George H.Pippy,
judge advocate on the staff of the
commander in chief; Colonel N. S.
Bangham, assistant adjutant general
of the State; Captain Simpson of the
Fifth Infantry and Captain F. V. Kees
ling, First Artillery, were appointed
a committee to revise ' the laws gov
erning tlie National Guard in this
State and to consider proposed amend
ments to the end that the same may
be made to conform to the militia law
known as the Dick bill.
A matter that is engrossing the at
tention of the guardsmen at this time,
particularly the men who shoulder the
guns, is what is to be done this year
In relation to an encampment Near
ly every man who is in the file is em
ployed in some occupation, from which
he must obtain leave of absence in
order to attend to camp duties, and
these men are required to. obtain such
leave several months in advance. The
matter has been under consideration
for some time by those in the upper
office, but nothing Â¦has been done ex
cept to pass the matter from one to
another until it is now in the hands
of the commander in chief." There is
also some curiosity to know if this
year It Is to be a camp with the reg
ular army, an independent division
camp, or regimental camps. It is
probable that in view of the existence
of the new militia law it will be a
camp with the regulars, as the pur
pose of the bill is to make the militia
or National Guard conform as closely
as possible to the routine and dis
cipline of the regular army. â¢ J
The Sharp Criticism of Last
Year Has Been Productive
of Some , Good Results

A schoolboy In Jewell City, Mo.,' was
assigned to prepare an essay on tha
subject of "Ducks," â¢ and this is what
he wrote: "The duck is a'low.vheavy
set bird. : composed mostly of meat and
ftathbrs. He is a mighty j poor singer,
having a hoarse voice caused by get
ting so many frogs in his neck. He
likes the. water, and carries a toy bal
loon .in his stomach. to keep him from
sinking. .The .duck "has only two lega
and .they are set. ao far back on his
running gear by, nature that; she came
purty near missing his body. Some
ducks when they get. big have curls on
their tails and are called . drakes.
Drakes don't have to set "or hatch, but
just loaf, go : swimming, and eat. If I
was to be a duck I'd. rather be a drake
every time."â New York Tribune.

Consumption of earth as food is said
to be common, not only in China, New
Caledonia and New Guinea, but in the
Malay archipelago as well. The.testi
mony of many travelers -in t"he Orient
is that the yellow races are especially
addicted to the practice. In Java and
Sumatra the clay used undergoes a
preliminary preparation for consump
tion, being mixed with water, reduced
to a paste and the sand and other hard
substances removed. The clay is then
fcrmed into small cakes or tablets
about as thick as a lead pencil and
baked in an iron saucepan. When the
tablet emerges from this process it re
sembles a piece of dried pork. The
Japanese frequently eat small figures
roughly modeled from clay, which re
sembles the animals turned out in pas
try shops. â New York Tribune.

000 Carnegie Library gives general sat'
isfaction. Three years have passed'
since the offer of the building fund'waa
made, and unexpected' delays have en
sued in the completion df the edifice.
The library board has taken great
pains to obtain a structure that' should
be both attractive and convenient for
administration. The interior is finished
In pine and redwood. Besides the large
public room there are rooms for refer
ence use, for the children's department
and an office for the librarian. As the
annual tax levy does not allow, after
paying the running expenses of the li
brary, a reasonable outlay for the pur
chase of books a strong effort is to be
made for raising money for this pur
pose by general subscription. Two in
dividuals have promised the sum of
$550, and many other sums can be read
ily obtained.
More than sixty books of valuable
classic literature have lately been given
to the Berkeley Public Library by Miss
M. D. Kellogg, the daughter of the late
ex-President Kellogg. The gift proves
to be a most acceptable one, as the. li
brary had long been in need of such
works. .
FRESNO'S. -NEW LIBRAKY.
The Santa Cruz Public Libiary has
received from 5\ D. Baldwin n check
for $100,. with the request that the sum
be expended for books of , special in
terest to the members of the Humane
Society.
Among the. valuable donations of
books lately received .by the Redding
library are sixty, volumes of ; Itaiian,
Spanish and, German works, that are
highly appreciated. .
The trustees .of the Pomona Public
Library have decided to admit children
under the age limit of 10 years to lim
ited privileges of the library. This' is
to be done by. taking the signature of
the parent or: guardian, besides that of
the. child, as a pledge. of the observance
,of . the library rules. .Â« Â¦â¢ , . : ;
The rapid- growth of free libraries
throughout the country brings before
their board3 - of trustees and the re
spective communities in which they ex
ist many puzzling problems: 'That of
properly" housing the increasing collec
tions; of books is very often solved by
the. '.building gifts of Mr. Carnegie.
Where, his aid is not -available in ji
large, city., there are .frequently wide
differences of opinion as to "'what is
the course to pursue in order
to provide for Ihe present wants and
the future growth of a library. Just
now Los .Anscles is in the throes -of
such a conflict of opinion. .
Four months ' ago a commission of
architects pro-no uncejd the flociing of
the Loa Angeles Public Library in the
City Ha!! to be. in a hazardous con
dition, owing to the imposition of a
strain for which the building ;had not
been designed. The, architects recom
mended that the flooring be made se
cure by carrying up steel columns frvm
the foundation of the building, at an
estimated cost of 510,000. This propo
sition is not favored by the City Super
visors. Various plans for erecting a
new library building have, for the pres
ent at least, fallen' through. Meanwhile
the monthly addition or half a ton of
new books so increases the strain on
the flooring that the library board
deems it unsafe to take further risks
and has ordered the discontinuance of
book purchasing till new library ac
commodations are secured elsewhere.

stated this evening that â¢ there was
nothing in the rumor, saying:
t'My sister has gone on a visit' to the
East and gave a general power of at
torney to her sister to act for her In
any matter that might come up. The
reference to a will contest in the power
of attorney was the general wording
used in such documents, and had no
reference to her case in particular. A
year has elapsed since the will was ad
mitted to probate, and such a thing as
a contest is hardly possible at this
time."

OAKLAND, March 19.â While English
and Continental playwrights have for a
century past invaded the American
stage with thousands of dramatic pieces
of varying and often questionable ex
cellence, it has come to pass at last that
a native Oaklander has made the first
breach in the conservative ranks of
German critics and has won the un
qualified and enthusiastic praise of the
German literati. Elmer B. " : Har
ris and the German version of his play,
"The Crucifixion," are now in the pub
lic eye in the old city of Hamburg. His
play has been accepted and is soon to
be produced by Baron Von Berger in
the first theater of Hamburg.
Harris is the son of Mrs. E. A. Har
ris of 1175 Market street, this city. He
is a graduate of the Oakland High
School and of the University of Cali
fornia. From the latter institution he
graduated with the- class of 1900, and
shortly afterward went into business in
San Francisco. After a year of com
mercial life he, threw up his position
and went to New York, where he -went
on the stage for the purpose of study
ing the drama from its purely mechan
ical side. He toured the East and Can
ada, revised a number of plays and
had a curtain-raiser produced in New
York. ' â¢
He then sailed for England with El
le^j Terry and has been made much of
by her, by the great London critic, Wil
liam' Archer, and others prominent in
English theatrical circles.
He spent aÂ». year in Paris, being per
sonally directed in his French studies
by M. Coquelln, the elder, who did so
much for Rostand. He has since been
studying* the German drama in Dres
den. Berlin and Hamburg.
The Harris play which is now inter
esting Hamburg is a two-act tragedy
somewhat after the Ibsen type. The
problem of^VThe Crucifixion"- is based
upon a question. of heredity, and the
piece Is philosophical, dramatic and
thoroughly practical from, the stage
point of view. London and English
critics who have seen the English ver
sion, declare it to be good literature
and marked by dramatic power.
Baron von Bergen, the autocrat of the
German theatrical world and director
of the theater at Hamburg, left lying
unread on his shelves some 1200 plays
by German writers to take up the work
of Harris. The play will be staged In
Hamburg in October. Harris will re
turn to spend the summer at his home
In this city. x / \

TQUNQ MAX WHO HAS WON SUC-
IN GERMANY WITH NEW
PLAT.
The inability of the prosecution to
connect the man seen in front of the
market and the man arrested was the
weak point In the case. R. S. Cameron,
who observed a man acting suspiciously
near the scene of the theft just before
the arrest, also failed to positively
identify Boeddiker as the man.
In his own behalf Boeddiker said that
he was on his way to West Berkeley
to set some whisky for his sick wife
when arrested. His testimony was sup
ported by his wife and daughter, who
declared that he had arisen at 11:30
o'clock on the night of his arrest to go
on the errand.
George Thompson, the arresting of
ficer, testified that. he had seen Boed
diker abstract twenty pounds of fish
from boxes on the sidewalk in front of
the Liberty market and then walk off
with them in a sack. Thompson said he
gave chase, but when he came up with
Boeddiker the man was empty-handed.
Afterward he found the sack of flsh in
a gutter.
A jury in Justice Edgar's court set
George Boeddiker free this afternoon
because the witnesses for the people
could not absolutely connect him with
the theft of fish he was accused of tak
ing from the Liberty. market one night
two weeks ago.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
214S Center Street, March 19.
The Regents of the University of Cal
ifornia are going to try to see if some
of the $50,000 squandered out of the
university funds by their late secretary,
W. A. McKowen, cannot be recovered
from the banks which cashed his
checks. To this end a suit was begun
this afternoon by Attorney Charles E.
Snook, legal adviser of the board,
against the First National Bank of
Oakland, the First National Bank of
Berkeley, the First National Bank of
San Francisco, the Central Bank of
Berkeley and W. A. McKowen to re
cover $1000 paid to McKowen in March,
11*02, on a check made payable to the
Regents by Bernard P. Miller.
The allegations made are that Miller*
made his check payable to the Regents
and that the check was cashed by the
banks upon its presentation by Mc-
Kowen. who, it is claimed, no au
thority to indorse the signature of the
Board of Regents. The check was
cashed by the Central Bank of Berke
ley and passed through the other banks
before reaching the First ational
Bank of Oakland, where Miller's de
posit was and from which the money
was paid.
McKowen indorsed the check by sign
ing "Regents of the University of Cali
fornia, per W. A. McKowen, sec'y."
The complaint sets up the allegation
that he had no right to do this, and
that it was the bank's buslnes to find
out whether he had before paying the
money.

A new building- would concentrate, to
the great advantage of the etudents,
the departments that are now spread
over creation. It would provide suffi
cient room for laboratories, lecture
rooms, farming implements and a mu
seum, such as a college that now ac
commodates ISO students really needs.
With this pamphlet the students of
the Agricultural Club purpose to edu
cate the people of the State. They will be
distributed everywhere. Not only this,
but the students will talk to the farmers
at farmers' Institutes and use their in
fluence with legislators In behalf of this
big project It Is hoped through all
this literature and talk to have the leg
islators of the State in such a frame of
mind by next January that they will
vote for almost anything the univer
sity asks.
Among other things this pamphlet
will show that the building is greatly
overcrowded, that every available
space from basement to roof is occupied
and that ramshackle barns and out
houses have been utilized to cover vari
ous departments. For lnstj^ice, one de
partment Is on the top flow of the bot
any building, another occupies a horse
ched that was fitted up, and still an
other works under a shed that hangs
over Strawberry Creek. Only recently
the rooms In the attic of the building
were cleared of many valuable records
and turned into offices for instructors.
Lectures are given in office rooms for
the lack of enough lecture-rooms to go
around.
TO EDUCATE PEOPLE.
The upshot of it all was the appoint
ment oZ a committee of five to put the
campaign on a practical basis. This
committee is composed of S. M. Stow,
J. E. Roadhouse. AJ R. Traphagen, F.
B. Kellogg and It. M. Filcher. It will
be this committee's first duty to com
pile a pamphlet in which the shortcom
ings of the present agricultural build
ing will be compared with those of
Eastern colleges.
Professors Hilgard and Wickson
spoke about the increasing activities
of the agricultural department and how
the present building Is being fast over
crowded by the growing demands upon
it, not only from the agricultural in
terests of the State, but the ever-In
creasing number of students. Andrew
Vekander, J. E. Roadhouse and S. M.
Slow, president of the club, spoke from
the student side of the question.
The letter of a member "of the last
Legislature was read, the writer de
claring: that It is not Impossible that
the next Legislature will vote an ap
propriation of 5230,000 or $300,000 for a
new building. The agricultural depart
ment is so ciore to so many people of
the State l>y reason of its intimate con
nection v.ith agricultural, horticultural,
dairying and other interests that if the
proper missionary work is done be
tween now and next January an appro
priation might be secured.
BUILDING OVERCROWDED.
President Wheeler told the agricul
turists that he was glad the students
had taken the initiative in working up
a sentiment in favor of a new agricul
tural building. Heretofore, he said, the
lobbying and educating had been done
by the faculty and friends of the uni
versity. Now the legislators seem td
be getting weary of the demands of the
university officers, and it is well that
the new requests come from the stu
dents, who know more than anybody
e!se what is required for their educa
tion and comfort.
For the first time in the history of
the University of California the stu
dents of the Institution have begun a
campaign for a new building. The
building that now houses the college
of agriculture at the university has be
come totally inadequate, and now tho
etudents, realizing this, have taken the
first ste^s toward securing another to
take its place.
The campaign was sent away from
the mark to-day by the Agricultural
Club, the students' organization. Thg
students met in the lecture-room of the
agricultural building, listened to
speeches and appointed committees.
President Wheeler was there, and so
were professors E. W. Hilgard and E.
J. Wickson, and they all gave valuable
advice.

Judging from the statements of shoe
manufacturers, wholsalers and sales
men, the demand for tan-colored shoes
and other: light shades for the ap
proaching spring and _ summer season
will not be '.phenomenal., nor will it
exceed the expectations of several
months ago. The season is now far
enough advanced to give a fair indica
tion of what may be ' expected In the
call for this class of goods. The opin
ion seems quite ; general that tans in
the; various shades will â¢ be confined
principally. to high-class goods, a small
amount to the medium fine grades, and
with very few among the cheap lines;
that tans will sell more freely In. the
larger cities than. for several years, es
pecially in the East and Middle West,
and also that their sale will; not by a
long Â¦ margin , affect that of the black
finishes.â Shoe and Leather Reporter.

Worcester'* and Webster's . diction
aries agree absolutely, in their definition
of : a "billion." They say: "According
to the French method ;of enumeration,
in use oh 'the continent of Europe and
in' the United" States,' a thousand mil
lions; according; to the English meth
od, used in Great Britain and the Brit
ish provinces, a million 1 millions.", "A.
R. B.'.' may contend that etymologically
a billion should mean a million raised
to the second . power. But usage often
defies - and overrules etymology. ' We
have deliberately chosen in , the United
States to call a thousand millions a bil
lion"; . and ' for us it means a thousand
millions "and- nothing else. -, .
1 "A. R. B." errs in charging! the' usage
he complains of to Journalistic license.
That usage has every official and com
mercial sanction. In his last annual re
port the Secretary of the Treasury tells

sentatives that: the Imports of - the fis
cal [year ended ; June 30, 1903, "exceede i

A correspondent, "A. R. B.," com
plains that In a recent editorial on "The
Debts of. Nations" we fell Into a com
mon error In calling a thousand mil
lionsâ 1,000,000,000â a billion. In his let
ter, which we ; printed on Sunday, he
says: "It is common' in. the Journalism
of this country to designate roughly a
thousand, millions as "a billion. The
practice is based on ignorance, how
ever, and there' is no authority forlt."
"A. R. B." writes from "New York
City." We do not know where he got
his ideas of the system of numera
tion in vogue in the United States. If
he Is an 'American,: we fail to under
stand how he can argue that there is
"no authority" for "designating a thou

Many of the negro residents of
Princeton, Ind., are greatly worked up
over "a ghost scare. Recently Henry
Whittaker, a young colored. man, was
killed, his head being almost crushed
off between two logs.
His residence was one of a row of
houses In the eastern part of the city,
all of which were occupied by negro
families. A few nights after the man's
death residents of the houses along the
row were* frightened out of their wits,
so they claim, by strange noises and
doors mysteriously opening. The next
day several families moved out, and
now only two of tne houses are â¢ ecu
pled. Whittaker was a fiddler, and the
colored people of that part of the city
are constantly, on the alert after sun
down now to avoid a headless man
with a fiddle under his arm. Â¦*; :
The white people take no. stock in
the "negro ghost, but have a "mysteri
ous man", of their own. He wears a
long overcoat and a slouch hat, and
prowls about residences, but when
spoken to immediately glides off with
out a -word. The police will probably
take care of the "white ghost." â In

Mrs. Emma Magoon Post of North
England. Iowa. Is totally blind, yet she
successfully manages the telephone ex
change for the town and the surround
ing country and has over three hun
dred subscribers on the lines she
operate?. A striking feature of this
remarkable exchange Is its system of
bell signals. Each line is provided with
a special bell of a special .tone and
those bells are all mounted in a cab
inet a few feet from the switchboard.
There are large bells, small bells,
wire clock gongs, sleigh bells and high
keyed bicycle bells. A fine bit of steel
wire four inches long Is soldered to
each hammer, and a square sheet of
paper attached to this wire bears the
line, name or number, forming a visual
signal for the assistant operator, "who
can see. The bell cabinet Is so situated
that the paper squares may be plainly
seen from the operator's seat
Mrs. Post Is able to distinguish not
only each one of the forty-five bells
by Its peculiar tone, but also the voices
of hundreds of men, women and chil
dren whom she serves. She is a grad
uate of Iowa College for the Blind, and
was noted at that institution for quick

"I see you have lots of applications,"
said the advertising manager to the
business manager, who had advertised
for a typewriter and bookkeeper.
"From all over New England," said
the business manager. Jamming his
pockets full. "But what some of the
girls who answer are thinking of I can
not imagine. Here Is one girl who will
come fifty miles to take a place at $5
a week."
"Can you tell much as to their quali
fications from their letters?"
"Can I? Well, rather. For instance,
there is the writing; there is the spell-
Ing of the words; there Is the way the
letter is put together; there is even the
way the letter Is folded. Ever think
that letters are folded so as to save
time nowadays?"
"No," said the advertising man. "It's
all I can do to get the stamps to put
on 'em. My stenographer folds 'em all
right, I guess. How should it be done?"
"Easy enough, simply enough, but
folded wrong often enough." said the
business man sententiously. "If your
typewriter knows her business she
takes the sheet and folds it up from
the bottom toward the top, leaving the
proper width for the envelope, 'then
over from right to left and from left
to right â sc. Then when your letter is
opened it is right side up. See?"
- "I see," murmured the advertising
man. "And how many applicants fold
their letters that way?"
"Oh, ' three or four out of a doxen,
perhaps. Quite a commentary on busi
ness as she is taught, eh?" remarked
the business man as he strolled away.

This plan of systematically caring
for the waste iron of railroads is of
recent origin. It is one really of slow
growth. Of course, pieces of Iron and
st?el waste rret *Â»\ai or the r*fusÂ»e of
shops or wrecks have been taken care
of for years, but only in a desultory and
haphazard way. It has remained for
modern management, which is directed
eternally to discovering little, new
economics of operation, to unearth this
novel idea of savlnp money. â New York
Sun. Â¦Â¦:â¢ Â»_' ;
Many thousands of dollars are saved
to the railroad companies each year by
detailing men to look after and care
for their scrap, the pieces of iron and
steel that fall off moving cars, that
come from abandoned machinery or
from broken pieces of equipment.
Almost all of the big transportation
companies in the United States main
tain what they call scrap departments.
At two or three points on the road,
generally where there are any con
struction or extensive repair shops,
this scrap is gathered from all parts
of the system.
One r.t the duties of the tra<?k walk
ers and repair gangs is to pick up and
throw into little heaps along .the track
all bits of Iron and steel that may be
found along the right of way or that
may be left whenever any piece of
work is completed. At irregular in
tervals a scrap train Is sent over the
road for the purpose of gathering: up
these odds and ends. They are taken
to the gathering point and there care
fully sorted.
Some ingenious mechanics hare de
vised -machinery to separate and
handle these scraps. After being run
through a sort of hopper that divides
the small and the large from the other
different sizes, men are put to work
to pick out fromfthe various heaps
what mar again be utilized. Bolts,
nuts, bars, couplings and the like,
which may be used again are worked
over for further use. The refuse,
amounting to thousands of pounds,
is shaped to some Iron works that has
a contract with the company for usins
all this waste iron ami steel.
The Railway Scrap Pile.
Before President Kruger, on October
10, 1899, cent to Great Britain -the ulti
matum which made the Transvaal War
inevitable, consols had /alien 2 points
within a month, and Transvaal mine
shares had been wholly demoralized.
But on the day of the. Boer manifesto
consols rose from 103% to 103%, and
went above 104 the ensuing week. This
was the general tendency, until the
British army learned at Ladysmlth, on
October . 30, the reality of their prob
lem. What followed later every one
knows.
There had been ample warning of the
Franco-Prussian v.ar of 1870. In the
fortnight prior to actual declaration of
war British consols had fallen one and
a half 'points, and even English rail
way shares two to five .-oints apiece.
The shock was, however, as severe as
if wholly unexpected. War, was de
clared on July 15, when consols stood
at 91%; they fell by the 20th to 88%,
and with them the whole "English mar
ket gave way. Outside of France, how
ever, this depression spent itself within
a week, and by ' August the markets
were recovering.
These three j precedents constitute
three very different series of phenom
ena; in 1899, a market which failed to
break when war began, but went to
pieces considerably later; in 1898,^ a
market which did all its "discounting"
before hostilities; in 1870. a market
which broke on declaration of war* and
recovered steadily thereafter. If last
week's market belongs to either of the
three above named classes it must be
ranged under the third. But It may
occupy a class of Its own. â New. York
Evening Post.
Recent discussions had made. It
pretty plain, to most people, that finan
cial markets frequently " "discount" in
advance, and very thoroughly such
events as a declaration of war. For this
reason*, during the recent excitement,
the %-point drop in consols, and the 4
to 5 per 'cent fall in Husslan and Jap
anese bonds, and the crash in all other
foreign investment issues, caused" a
good deal of surprise.
But "discounting" is not always com
pleted beforehand. In our Spanish War
of 1893 it was. The Maine was" blown
up on February 15; but the President
did not send his "intervention message"
to Congress until April 11. This mes
sage was really the declaration of war;
yet stocks advanced 1 to 2 points on the
news of it. The market had been "over
sold."

kets Usually Is â 1899,
1898. 1870.

He came' to Oakland from New York
at. the request of his wife, who as niece
of the late Mary Canning was left half
of her fortun*. valued at about $73,000.
Mrs.Davitt's two brothers have threat
ened a contest over the* will of their
aunt and Mrs. Davitt, finding herself
beset with difficulties, appealed to her
husband for advice.
Upon the arrival of Mr. Davitt in
this city he stated to a Call reporter
that he, did not expect to remain here
more than a week, but that his health
had been so poor that, at the urgent
request of Mrs. Davitt, he had come
to. California in hopes that he would
get well. This evening he retired early
and could not be seen, but Mrs. Davitt
said: "My husband is suffering from
a severe j cold .which has settled upon
his lungs, which has prevented him
from leaving the house or attempting
to make any of the addresses expected
of him on St. Patrick's day. He is
asleep this evening and I am in hopes
that he will be better in the morning."
Michael Davitt, the Irish leader, is
ill with a severe attack or la grippe
at his temporary home, 573 Telegraph
avenue, in this city. He came here
from New York a week ago and at
that time was complaining of not feel
ing well. He made the trip to Cali
fornia In hope that the change of cli
mate would be. beneficial to him. . In
stead of this his malady seems to have
taken a firmer, hold upon him and for
the last two days he has been unable
to leave the house.

John A. Massie, editor of a weekly
political paper called The Arrow, com
plained to the police to-day that he
had been set upon by three man near
his home this morning and beaten. He
stated that , he was waiting for a car
near his home at 1015 Linden street,
when three men approached him from
different directions. He paid no atten
tion to them until one man, he says,
struck at him. Another hit him with
a brick, he thinks, and knocked him
down. When he* got up the men ran
away.
Massie was very much frightened at
the incident and claims to know of
no reason for the alleged attack. 'He
showed the police an .umbrella which
has an initial marked upon it, which
Massie says one of the men dropped.
In his statement to the police Massie
said that they were young men with
whom he had the trouble and that
he did not believe .he had . ever seen
them before and did not know that
he would recognize them again. He
was unable to state whether they took
him for some one 'else or whether it
was "a prearranged plan. Chief of Po
lice Hodgkins says that the matter will
be looked into.

Bible work in Persia has Buffered a
serious Interruption recently In a j pro

which forbids the entering Into Persia
of either the Arabic, Turkish, Azerbl
jani and Persian Scriptures. A con
signment sent during the last year by
the' American Bible Society to the Pres
byterian missionaries, at Tabriz was
detained at j Bushlre, , and thus their
admission has been refused. Protests
have been made through the State De
partment at Washington, and the Brit
ish authorities have been similarly ap

of labor all along between these.polnts.

Barl and Venice have always disput
ed as to which of them possesses the
authentic bones of St. Nicholas, but
there would seem to be no doubt in the
mind of the Russian General Bagdono
vitch, who, on seeing: them, offered the
Cathedral of Barl 1.000,000 rubles (about
$105,000) for them, with the Intention of
taking; them to Russia, where this
saint is extraordinarily popular.^ It ap
pears that General Bagdonovltch was
visiting Bar! when he saw the relics,
which are at the bottom of a species of
well, the bones being: crossed and water
springing from them continually. He
became very thoughtful, and then ex
claimed: "I will give you 1,000,000 ru
bles for them." When those present
smiled, thinking he was joking, he re
peated his offer several times, but of
course it was refused. The present
Czar, as Czarowltch, visited the same
relics while the cathedral was the scene
of Queen Helena's abjuration of the
orthodox creed and her conversion to
Roman Catholicism. It is thought that
the matter j/ill not end here, and that
the general will make further ' efforts
to secure the bones, but, of course, he
has no chance of success. â London Tel

During the trial of an accident
case against one of the city trolley
companies an elderly lady was sum
moned as a witness for the plaintiff.
The attorney for the railroad company
put her under a very severe" cross-ex
amination and tried the best he could
to make her appear as ridiculous as
possible. But he reckoned without
his host.
"Madame," said he, "do I under
stand you to say that you were there
at the time the accident happened?"
"How do I -" she began.
"Stop!" he cried. "Don't indulge in
any long - dessertations. Answer my
question, yes or no. If you don't I
shall be obliged to ask the court to
compel you to answer. Listen. - Do
I understand you to say "
Â¦ Quick as a flash the old lady re
plied: "I'm sure I don't know what
you understand me to say. Tou may
be an idiot!"
After that courtesy ruled the day. â

The Island of Jolo covers fully 320
square miles. It is of coral formation
and offers an excellent harbor to the
west. In topography it is gently undu
lating and covered throughout Its en
tire length by .the rankest tropical
vegetation, valuable teakwood being
found extensively throughout the en
tire district. Nowhere in the world
are more luscious fruits produced.
Among those peculiar to this belt is
the durian, which is about the size of
a muskmelon. Its exterior presents
somewhat the appearance of a chestnut
burr, being prickly and tough: within,
the fruit is white and cheesellke, and
owing to this peculiarity the American
soldier dubbed it "the vegetable lim
burger." The mangosteen is another
of the rare fruits. It is the size of an
average orange, chocolate colored, and
has a very brittle skin. Inside, four
white sections contain a colorless Iiduid.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
In the procession of judges and bar
risters with which the English law
courts has reopened the wigmaker
plays a conspicuous part. Hplstoy has
said that in some plays the maker-uy
is as great an artist as the actor. It
may be that the wigmaker Is as im
portant a pillar of the law as the Lord
Chancellor himself.
Wigs, like many other human Insti
tutions, are not what they were. The !
old wig had to be made of human hair
of a dark color, and was pomatumed
and powdered every morning. An army
of dressers went down to Westminster
and there attended to each of his circle
of clients, with whom he had an annual
contract. It was not a particularly en
joyable occupation, but It meant a
steady income, which was completely
cut off by the introduction of the horse
hair wig. We have wondered how the j
human hair was procured, and from
all we have learned are still at liberty
to Imagine that it came from the heads
of felons the advocacy of other bar
risters had brought to the scaffold.
To-day Dr. Tristram, chancellor of
the Bishop of London's Consistory
Court, is the only considerable luminary
who wears the old style of wig, though
until very lately he was kept in count
enance by Mr. Iderwick, K. C. The
wigs that are worn now are made of
white horse hair, with a faint admix
ture of black. They do not require to be
powdered, and only once in half a
dozen years or so need they be recurled.
Some half dozen wigmakers in and
around the Temple and Lincoln's Inn â
many of them related by marriage, and
all of them of long standingâ furnish
the gown and wig lawyers between
them. It seems that there is an open
ing for a competitor. The price of a
plain barrister's wig is Â£5 5s, but it
sometimes takes two or three weeks to
make.
The head of Mr. Briefless Is very
carefully measured and the lines of
his cranium marked upon the most
suitable of a hundred blocks or more
that the shop contains. The proper
surface is then covered with a trellis
of fine silk ribbon, carefully sewn to
gether at every point of intersection
On this trellis" work the wie is care
fully built, so that at last it fits al
most as closely as the owner's scalp
itself. Other industrious finders have
prepared long strings of hair woven
upon silk cord â for the crown of the
head little loops, and for the back
something more like cropped hair, and
technically called '-'Bnap." Hundreds
of yards of the two kinds are sewn
on to the foundation, till all is close
ly covered and then the various curls,
each very nicely made, are added.
Those two little curls that dangle
down the back (Sir Edward Carson's
wig lacks one of them) are each made
of two sets of hair, plaited like fingers
in prayer at the end, and thence curved
together and so deftly knotted that
not a hair is buckled from its place.
It is a long time before the average
barrister comes back for a new wig.
Even the man who does not care to
wear a silk hat that has lost its pris
tine gloss appears cheerfully in a wig
twenty years old. In fact, an old wig
is often a desideratum, as it invests
the head of its wearer with an ap
pearance of having a large practiceâ an
appearance that is sometimes contrary
to the fact. One of the largest of heads
belonging to the legal profession Is that
of Lord Alverstone. â New York Globe.
The t American who lets alcohol alone
and observes the most ordinary health
rules, It is claimed, will have nothing
to fear If he goes with the rush to the
new republic of Panama when canal
work starts under American auspices.
The disease bogey threatens to keep
many a good man away from the isth
mus ,and_ merely because somebody has
told him that he will have only half a
chance for his life after he has worked
there a few months.
There is plenty of sickness, and much
of it in aggravated form, in Panama
and the other isthmian countries, but
it is mostly among the natives, who are
content to live ajid die, If necessary t
In the filth to which they have always
been accustomed. The f easy-going
French contractor, who had more of an
eye to his pocket than to the condition
of the workmen who. would bring the
money jinto his strong box, winked at
the lack of sanitation. If onÂ« native
died, there was always another to take
his place. It was rarely that the con
tractor or any of the fo'remen perished.
The medical reports made by physi
cians from this city who went down
during the preliminary surveys give
pretty fair ideas of what the conditions,
will be when canal building begins in
earnest once more. Among those who
were on the medical staff of the com
mission was Dr. John P. Gunion of this
city, and of his observations he says:
CONDITIONS XEAR THE COAST.
"In the vicinity of the coast the
health conditions are, during both the #
wet and dry seasons, quite good, my
observation being that those who exer
cised ordinary hygienic precautions
had little more to fear of serious ill
ness than though they lived in a tem
perate city, Washington for instance.
I was with the Darien exploration par
ty for parts of both seasons, and during
neither was the temperature so high as
I had been led to believe It would be.
Indeed, many August days in this city
are far more oppressive than the worst
of the isthmian days.
"Back from the coast the health con
ditions are not at all bad, especially on
the high ground, of which there is
plenty. In short, you may live or die,
the choice being largely with the Indi
vidual. The man who lives in the cities
has to face worse days than the one
who goes back into the country. Sani
tation is the thing last thought of in
the cities. What. would be considered
absolutely essential in even the most
graft-ridden American municipality has
not yet penetrated the ease-loving of
ficial in Panama. Every man does as
he pleases, with no one to criticize or
reprove him. The American Indian liv
ing In a tepee on the plains, with no
white man to instruct him, knows more
of the right way of living than the in
dolent revolutionist of the isthmus. To
morrow is always time enough for him
to take up any proposed reform, unless
It be a revolution. Into this he enters
heart and soul, with no thought for the
welfare of his body should, he be strick
i en in battle. His family for generations
back has fought fever, and he expects
to do the same until it conquers him.
WORSE IN CITIES THAN OUTSIDE
"From an understanding of these
facts it is conceivable that disease is
more prevalent in the cities. Panama
.City is at present rather a poor place
to live, though even there it is better
than at Colon. Of tropical and other
diseases these cities receive their share.
So do Baranqullia, Savanilla and
Carthagena, in none of which could I
find anything that approached a sani
tary system. I saw malarial fever in
Its many forms, yellow fever, typhoid
fever and dysentery," though not the
tropical dysentery, which I found to be
rare In this section.
"These were the diseases which
claimed victims by thousands during
Dc Lesseps regime, but it should be
remembered that in the heyday .of the
French control sanitary science had not
attained the relatively important posi
tion it now has. Every recent discovery
in the great and as yet little explored
field of bacteriology has coiHributed its
part toward placing sanitary science In
Its present high position. The French
man knew nothing of the danger that
Jurked in the common' mosquito.
"He always realized that malarial
fever. was something to be avoided if
he could manage it, but he never slept
under netting or drained swamps as a
preventive.. This Is a. point .which
the American medical force will keep
to the fore air the time. Statistics for
the first six months of American con
trol seem likely to show a wonderful
decrease In malaria among the work-
Ing force. The same Is true of yellow
fever, for, Dr. Reed's great work In
hunting down the same death-dealing
mosquito as the bearer of the worst of
all the scourges gives another Inkling
as to what must first be done by the
medical corps that goes with the canal
workers.
"What has been done In' â¢Havana
can be, and will undoubtedly be done
in. Panama; and Colon. Add to the
means taken there for stamping out

It is doubtful whether protective
mimicry among animals is better ex
emplified than in the case of the fish
commonly known as the marbled
angler of the Sargasso Sea (Ptero
phryne histrio). Owing to its peculiar
structure* it is a poor swimmer and it,
therefore, spends most of its life mov
ing slowly about on the bottom among
corals, seaweed, etc., which these
fishes closely resemble in color and
in outline. They > cling, too. to the
floating masses of sargassum weed
with their peculiar fins, and the color
markings of the fish closely resemble
the weed itself. Not only does the
weed thus furnish a home for this
species, but the fish actually con
structs a nest from it and therein de
posits its eggs. One of these nests,
found in connection with the Hassler
expedition in 1871, was described as
consisting of .a round mass of sar
gassum, about the size of two fists
rolled up together. To all appear
ances It was made of nothing but this
gulf weed, the branches and leaves of
which were, however, evidently knit
together, and not merely tangled into
a roundish mass; for, though some of
the leaves and branches hung loose
from the nest, it became at once vis
ible that the bulk of the ball was held
together by threads trending In every
direction- among the seaweed. By
close observation it became apparent
that this mass of seaweed was a neat,
the central part of which was bound
up In the form of a ball, with sev
eral loose branches extending in vari
ous directions. On still closer ex
amination the nest above described
was found to be full of eggs, which
were scattered throughout the mass.
Nature has thus afforded a safe
asylum for these somewhat helpless
fishes, whose cutaneous filaments,
which are plentifully provided on the
belly, around the mouth and on the
dorsal spine, so nearly resemble the
weed itself that predaceous fishes
doubtless fall to recognize the living
animals, and thus the latter escape
extermination. â Scientific American.

"In my own case it has been a great
blessing in at least one way, for fel
lows with long necks, you know, do not
look so well when you harness them
up In low collars. My neck is long, long
as a crane's, and the high collar has
kept me from leaving too much of it
exposed. Why, I've got so much neck
that when I first began to wear low
collars I was almost ashamed to ven
ture out into the street. I felt like I
was but half-dressed, and the feeling
was not so far wrong at .that, for the
low collar does leave a good part of my
anatomy open and aboveboard, as it
were.
"But this fact does not bother ma
now. I simply don't care at all. Ex
posed neck is a whole lot better than
headache, you know, old chappy. I
Â¦was speaking of headache Just now.
That's what I wanted to tell you about
The high collar do<s something more
than interfere with one's circulation.
It scratches and irritates the skin,
keeps one's chin at an unreasonable
uncomfortable and unnatural angl*
and. causes one to acquire a nervous

"When you meet your friend who is
in the habit of wearing a high collar
pay particular attention to the way ha
moves and holds his head. It Â° isn't
at all natural. It Is all due to the
high collar. Mark you, there are high
collars and . high collars. Some of
them ' approach rationalism In neck
dress. - Others are about as far from
it as it is possible to get without en
gulfing the whole head. Bat,' pt
course, every fellow to his own liking
in these matters. I wear low eol)arÂ»
because they are comfortable and be

producer of headaches and a bad thing
for one's nerves generally." â Dallas

"You may not know it, old fellow,
but there is a very intimate connection
between the high collar and the head
ache," said an observant man, "and I
have proved my faith in toe statement
by refusing to wear collars of the high
sort. It is a bad business, my boy.
High collars choke up the veins and
arteries and interfere to some extent
with the circulation of the blood in the
neck and head. Do not understand me

Trading In vegetables was rather light for a
Saturday, as the rainy weather "kept many
buyers away from the market. Prices 0* As
paragus declined sharply under heavy receipts,
1000 boxes being received. The market closed
weak, with several, hundred boxes unsold. Re
ceipts of Rhubarb were 346 boxes and prices
had a wide range as to quality. Several deal
ers, who had purchased supplies from the
growers at $2 per box, were obliged to sell for
lee* In order to clean up. Consigned lots of
choice stock were offered at $1 60 per box, and
sales above that flsure were rare. The Grow
ers 1 Association announced that the prices for
the coming week would be $1 50 for choice and
80c for standard f. o. b. San Lorenzo. Tho
other vegetables were In moderate supply and
prices showed but slight variation.
The Potato market was heavily supplied, re
ceipts being liberal and carrled-over stock
abundant. Trade was very quiet and previous
prices ruled for all descriptions. Some fancy
lots of Oregon Onions came in and sold at a
slight advance. Old stock continued plentiful
and dull at unsteady rates. Green were In
Xreo supply and lower.

ders for wheat were in evidence at the open
ing. The cry was quite generally advanced
. that the Sully affair would cause freer scope
I to be given to the Influence of so-called "leglt
| imate" conditions. Initial quotations for May
were lower to He higher at 92@92Â»4c.
July was %c lower to '*c higher at SC%@
87V.sC. Shorts were especially heavy buyers
and with limited offerings prices made a
quick advance. May selling up to 93c and July
to S7%c. Reports from Kansas and other
sections of the Southwest were to the effect
that the rainfall of the last few days was
quite inadequate to the needs of the growing
plant and that hopes of a satisfactory crop
of winter wheat were becoming fainter as the
season progressed. Toward the end of the
first hour, however, in spite of the prepon
derance of bullish Information, there was
much wheat for sale, supposed to be for the
account cf Eastern speculators. Under this
selling May declined to 01*ic while July
reacted to S6-%c. On the break there was free
covering by shorts and buying by pit traders
on the theory that the market had been
largely oversold. An improved cash demand
increased the buying in speculative trading
and caused a sharp rally. May advanced to
I Wi r ,i,Q, and July to S7%c. The close was
strong, with May at !)."t4c. Final figures on
1 July were -at R'S^ii^ftc. f Â¦ â â¢ .Â«â¢--Â«
A material improvement was manifested In
corn at the opening, but the market was very
nervous and sensitive to moderate trading on
either side. The close was strong and near
the top figures. May opened unchanged to
%c higher at tH%Q82\ic, sold between 51%c
and &2% c < and closed at 52%c. July ranged
between 49c and f>O%c, cloelng with a gain of
l\i-fn%c at 00TiÂ®31c.
Oats made a substantial recovery from the
closing weakness of the previous session. The
close was well toward the top. May opened
VÂ»c lower, to ViC higher at SQYtQX)%c. After
selling between 39Uc and 40%c, the close was
at 40Â«igj0',ic July ranged between 3814c

Judge Head found that the corpora
tion engaged Wedekind to supervise
ihe construction of a smelter near
Copley, this county, at a contract price
of $2600, the money to be paid in nine
months at the rate of S600 a month;
that Wedekind was employed a few
days over two months when his ser
vices were dispensed with, the com
pany paying him $920 on his contract
price, that sum being for services per
formed. They refused to pay more.
The corporation, which never has
built the projected smelter, proved it
never had written a contract with
Wedekind. but Judge Head held that
the showing made by Wedekind by
means of letters and telegrams waa
sufficient proof that the contract was
entered into. f '..",
