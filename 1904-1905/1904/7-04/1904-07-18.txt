taken the collection to the altar, grin

It is said here on what appears to be
good authority that Judge Parker ha3
not invited Tammany Leader Charles
F. Murphy to come to Rosemount.
It was pointed out to Kern that the
newspapers had intimated that August
Belmont was out of the race for na

possible that Taggart would have
charge of active work in the West and
Mr. Sheehan in the East. Mr. Kern
said nothing but nodded his head in a
contemplative way.

following him with his sword gleaming
In the air. The elder man had almost
collapsed when a policeman arrived.
He had a wound over the left eye and
was removed to Seney Hospital, where"
an examination showed that there had
been no serious injuries. He notified
the police that he would make no com
plaint against his son.
The combat, it is alleged, started by
the son throwing a large dumb-bell at
his father, striking him on the arm and
side. There was a general scrimmage
during which some costly bric-a-brac
was destroyed. The father drew a
sword-cane with a long steel blade and
Etarted for the son. The young man
drew a revolver and fired five shots.
It is not believed that he tried to hit
his father, for If he had the distance
between the two was so slight that
some of the shots would have taken
effect instead of burying themselves in
the walls.

he considers it unnnecessary.
Barksworth characterized Judge Par

that he would stultify himself by act

in accord with the predominating in

JACKSON, Mich., July 17.â Thomas
E. Barksworth, chairman of the Dem

"Intellectually and morally," says.
Pettigrew, in his interview, "Bryan

leadership for the leadership of Bel

To complicate the controversy still
more, the allied craft at the stock
yard?, numbering 14,000 workmen, have
become restless and are anxious to join
the men already out in a sympathetic
ftrike. Whether these men shall strike
or not will be decided to-morrow wh<*n
Donnelly returns from St. Louis. These
unions, representing thirty of the me
chanical trades in the packing plants,
have decided to quit work if Donnelly
says so.
With Donnelly, the strikers' leader,
in St. Louis looking after that end,
no effort was made to-day to renew
the pcao*: negotiations. Whether an
other attempt to reach an adjustment
of the controversy by arbitration will
be made b problematic, as the packers,

CHICAGO. July 17.â In an attack this
afternoon on four colored strike break
ers by a mob composed of spectators
at an amateur ball game in the vicinity
of the stockyards, two white men, one
policeman and the four strike breakers
were severely wounded. Revolvers and
knives were used and three of thÂ«Â»
wounded men are in a serious condi
tion. They are: William Durand, shot
in jaw and neck, condition serious;
James Kiely, 6tabbed in left side, near
heart, may die; Policeman J. W. Swee
ney, struck on head and back by
bricks while trying to quell the dis
turbance, severely cut and bruised;
John Hunter, colored, severely cut
about head and body; Samuel Wood,
colored, shot and beaten, condition se
rious: William Riley, colored, face cut
and bruised about body; Grant Baker,
colored, cut about head and body.
After finishing their day's work at
Sehwarzschild & Sulzberger's plant, the
Jour colored strike breakers, on their
way home, had to pass the grounds
where the game was In progress. There
were fully lOOO persons watching the
gamp, most all of whom were friends
of the men who went on strike last
voek.
XJXnOES DEFEXD THEMSELVES.
As the four workmen approached the
place some one in the crowd yelled
"scab!"' and instantly a rush was made
for the negroes. Wood had a revolver
and Baker a knife and as the mob
btarted for them they drew their weap
ons. Before they could use them, how
ever, they were knocked to the ground
by a dozen white men.
Bak^r scrambled to his feet and be
par. hashing right and left and before
Ihe knife could be taken away from
him he had stabbed Kiely. Wood fired
into the crowd while lying on the
ground. Two of the bullets hit Durand,
on- at thÂ«? attacking party.
This resistance by the negroes set
the croud into a frenzy and. had not
thp police made a quick response to a
riot call, some of the strike breakers
would have been killed. As it was.
they Tvere thrown to the ground and
pounced into insensibility before the
police could scatter the crowd. Several
of the rioters, together with Wood
and Baker, were arrested.
King Menelik has acknowledged the
receipt of this message and said that
the status of the bearer of the treaty
was perfectly understood by him.
Assistant Secretary Loomis said - to
day that he had found nothing to war
rant the conclusion that his brother
had committed suicide or was the vic
tim, of foul play. He said he was con
vinced that it was purely a case of ac
cidental death.
Inquiry at the State Department
elicited the fact that when it was de
cided to have the treaty carried for
ward from Paris by William II. Ellis
in order to insure its prompt arrival in
Abyssinia, a cablegram was sent to
King Menelik stating explicitly that,
as the messenger who had set out with
the treaty had disappeared, it probably
would be sent on by W. H. Ellis, who
carried it as a matter of accommoda
tion and who "is proceeding to Abys
sinia on personal business in which
this Government has no interest and
with which it has no concern." It was
also stated in the same cablegram
that the bearer of the treaty, whoever
he was, would have no official or dip
lomatic character whatsoever.
, LONDON, July .17.â Reports to both,
the Press Association and the Central'
News assert that a \lf rther examina
tion of the body of F.' -, Kent Loomis,
which was found yesterday at Warren
Point, some fifteen miles from Ply
mouth, has given rise to grave sus
picions on the part of the local officials
that Loomis met with foul play. The
wound behind the right ear is described
as being circular, large and clean," and
it is. believed that it .was inflicted be
fore death. It is surmised that Loomis'
body fell into the water near the Eddy
stone lighthouse.
Joseph G. Stevens, American Consul
at Plymouth, in response to a telegram
sent to-night asking him if the local
reports >of foul pla# had any basis or
if he had any ground for suspicion re
garding the death of Loomis, replied:
"I regret I cannot make any state
ments prior to the inquest, which will
be held to-morrow.. . The wound on the

The wreck occurred at the corner of
Oregon avenue and Third street. Car
No. 186 of the Hollywood line was run
ning west on Oregon avenue at a high
rate of speed. As it approached Third
street cars Nos. 196 and 54, coupled to

north. Before the motorman of the
westbound car could reverse brakes his
coach crashed violently into the two
other cars, throwing them from the
rails in different directions and smash

the Hollywood car were fearfully
wrecked and the front wheels and
fenders of the other cars were torn
ccmipletely from the axles.

ST. PETERSBURG, July 17.â The
news that, the Russian . volune.eer fleet
steamships Smolensk and St. Peters
burg, new cruising in the Red Sea, are
stopping ships of neutral nations and
searching them for contraband of war,
is causing the liveliest interest in all
circles. Russia has evidently weighed
the question, believes herself to be
within her rights and neither fears nor
expects international complications. In
deed, some of the powers may have
been sounded by Russia on the subject.
Nevertheless, foreign opinion is awaited,
eagerly and more or less criticism is
expected. *
Members of the diplomatic corps are
keenly anxious to ascertain the views
their Governments will, take .of the
passage through the Dardanelles of
these vessels of the volunteer .fleet as
merchantmen and their subsequent
conversion into ships of war. The gen
eral view in diplomatic circles, even
where sentiment is not particularly fa
vorable to Russia, Is that while the
passage of the Dardanelles might
be considered a piece of i sharp
practice on the part of Russia,. it Is
an accomplished fact and the powers
will not now regard it as. a violation
of the treaty of Paris, but will, guard
against its repetition.

DEATH CALLS
THE FOUNDER
OF SEMINARY
AmQngr the passengers on the Amer
ica Maru, which reached port yester
day, wer-e several Japanese",
while they were traveling quietly, at
tracted much attention on board by
their distinguished bearing and their
evidently wide knowledge of the af
fairs of the world. They kept to them
selves and said little as to their in
tentions or reasons for their visit to
this, country, but it was apparent to
all that they were here on some mis
sion of no small importance. . An at
mosphere of secrecy and reserve per
vaded the doings and sayings of them
all. . . , ,
To add to the mystery of their
movements, while some of the party
say they are going to England arid
some to Hartford, it was ascertained'
that a portion of their effects go in
bond to Xew York, while other boxes
are destined to The Hague. Their mis
sion is believed to lie beyond the
United Whether its real pur
pose is connected with the current war
between their country and Russia, the
members of their party were careful
not to disclose. Rumor on ship board
explained the expedition as directed
against the Czar's Baltic fleet, now
bound for the Orient. This, however,
is only a guess.
By right of his title Count T. Todo
was the most prominent member of
the party. The Count is twenty years
of age and he said, in what he called
a "six-months-acquired-English," that
he was on his way to England to en
ter Cambridge University.
Count Todo was accompanied by. his
secretary, I. Okamoto, and his friend,
H. Sato. These gentlemen both speak
English fluently and are up-to-date in
every way. j
Sato was not in any way inclined to
talk. At first' he would say nothing
about the . doings of the Count or his
own movements. When asked what
course of" studies the Count would pur
sue at Cambridge he was evasive. They
intended to wait until they got there
before they decided. How long would
he remain in England? He could not
say. He might be there a month and
he might not. Where would he -go
from England? He could not say.
Secretary Okamoto looked on, silent.
As his friend Sato talked he smiled
knowingly, but said nothing. '
The most mysterious of the Japanese
passengers was K. } Seto. On the pas
senger list of the steamship he was
plain "Mr. K. Seto," but he admitted
that he was an attache of the engineer
corps of the Japanese army. While
affable of manner and a good English
scholar, he was averse to saying any
thing on the subject of his visit here,
but he finally spoke as follows:
"I am In company with two workmen
from the Toklo arsenal. We are go
ing to Hartford, Conn., where it is our
purpose to investigate the engineering
arts. We will report to Major Koba
yashi when we arrive there. We ex
pect to remain In Hartford about six
months. I am a graduate of the me
chanical engineering department of the
Tokio University."
When they landed at the dock the
Japanese showed much interest in sev
eral large cases which were to be
shipped in bond direct to New York.
These cases were all apparently very
heavy. A suggestion was made that
they might contain machinery of some
sort, but for what use or purpose they
were entered Is not known.
Members of the party .were, in con
ference with the Japanese 'Consul last

CHICAGO, July 17.â While the pack
ing industry Is tied up. Samuel Fox
of this city has seized the opportunity
to bring to public notice a device for
the painless slaughtering of animals.
Fox believes cattle, sheep and hogs
should be placed under an anaesthetic
before being killed.
Fox's device consists of a pen into
which the animal Is driven and con
fined in a small space by the working
of automatic floor and walls. The head
of the animals protrudes, a rubber cap
is thrown over it and nitrous oxide gas
Is turned on at a pressure of twenty
pounds to the square inch. In less than
a minute, the Inventor declares, the
animal is overcome. Then it is swung
up from a cage and tl>e killing is ef
fected by cuttingr the throat.
Fox holds that'this method is as fast
aa the one now used. The packers,
however, have not interested them
selves In the invention, and Fox sug
gests to. the Humane Society that it
might be well .to compel the adoption
of the anaesthetic device by legisla
tion.

PAINLESS KILLING OF STOCK.
At the Fremont Gover mine a barb

ported miners are boarding at the
mine. Work will be resumed to-mor

Word was received by the Amador

the representatives of the union set
out to persuade the strangers to keep
cut of the county. Sheriff Norman,
lÂ»eputy Jackson and Constable Tuttle

numbered forty-eight. They were
brought into the county within a few
miles of lone on a special car and
thence were brought in teams to the
mine.
BUTTER CREEK, July 17.â At the
Frtmont Cover; one of the largest
mints in Araador County a strike
occurred about three months . aco.
The- cause of the walk-out then
vas the refusal of the company to dis
charge a certain man working under
ground who had refused to join the
union. The non-union miner left the
property after the strike took place,
but the men continued the strike, de
manding higher wages. The company
xx 1 used any increase whatever in
wages, and hence the mine has re
mained closed for three months.
It has been known for some time
that the company intended to work
the mine at any cost, as the property
is too valuable to allow it to deteri
orate. Non-union men have been ex
pected at the mine every night for a
week and a representative of the Ama
dor City miners' union has been kept
on the road between Amador City and
Carbondale in readiness to send word

the Citizens' Water Company burst at
midnight and more than 300,000,000 gal

sweeping all before it and inundating

It was discovered about nine o'clock
that the dam was In danger ot break-
Ing and messengers were hastily sent
through the valley to warn the popu

saved, for a few hours later the whole
valley was under water.

ST. PETERSBURG, July 18, 4:25 a.
nÂ». â Xews from the front, both offi
cial and / unofficial, is remarkably
scant. General Sakharoff's report,
which brings the situation up to July
15, does not mention the occupation
of Yinkow, but speaks of the Russians
driving out the Japanese from the
coast town of Huantichan, between
Yinkow and Kaichou. On the other
hand, according to. General Sakharoff,
the advance to Tatchekiao is continue
ing leisurely. The Japanese advance
parties apparently are moving south
eastward to Tatchekiao, while .strong
parties are intrenching between Fen
shui and MotJen passes.
A special dispatch from Lioayang,'
the date of which is doubtful, though
seemingly about contemporaneous
with Lieutenant General Sakharoff's
report, says: Â¦ â¢ .
"A British gunboat appeared , off
Yinkow on July 15. The commander
wanted to enter the port to guard the
interests of the , British ' residents, in
view of the probability that the town
may be shortly, occupied by the Jap
anese. The, gunboat Slvoutch hoisted
a battle flag, went out' and requested
the British vessel to draw off.' which
it did. It is reported the gunboat re
turned later 'with two other vessels.
All of these out to sea that night.

ST. PETERSBURG, July 17.â Ex
perts who^ recently- were inclined to
criticize General Kuropatkin's manage
ment of affairs In the Far East declare;
as -the situation develops, that his strat
egy has proved so far beyond re
proach. He has successfully tided
over a pressing danger â how pressing
only those in close touch with the Far
East realize'. His apparent mistake,
like the prolonged resistance offered by
Lieutenant General Zassulitch on the
Yalu, â¢ turn out to have been . acts of
the highest military judgment. Gen
eral Kuropatkin then had so few and
such poor troops at Liaoyang that
the Japanese would have had an easy
task crushing the main force of the
Russians, had -they been permitted to
cross the Yalu without severe punish
ment, and the thousands lost by Zas
sulitch practically saved Liaoyang. .
General Baron Stakelberg's march,
which also was criticized, is now ad
mitted to have been necessary. The
rudiments of war are that the army
should be in constant touch with the
enemy, otherwise it would be impos
sible to know . the strength of its op
ponents or to be informed of â¢ their
movements. ; General Stakelberg's
march .was a reconnaissance on . a
grand scale, and not only enabled Gen
eral Kuropatkin to ascertain the
enemy's strength and disposition, but
materially disturbed the Japanese
plans relative to the siege of Port
Arthur, gradually drawing the bulk of
the Japanese army to follow the re
treating column and thus distracting
attention from the vulnerable spot be
tween Liaoyang and Mukden.
Meanwhile the men at Kuropatkin's
headquarters are improving. Fifty
thousand of the best troops from
European Russia have reached Liao
yang- within a month and if the Rus
sian commander-in-chlef should choose
now to accept a battle he will be able
to inflict a heavy blow. All Russia
is looking forward with confidence to
the issue of the fight.
The injunction was Issued at the in
stance of the Armour, Swift and Nel
son Morris Packing companies.
This is believed to indicate that tha
packing companies named expect to
start up again in a short time.

In New- York City there is one tel
ephone subscriber to every 500 of
population. There is but one tele
phone company serving this city. In
some Western towns the ratio often
raises tÂ« one in twelve, and these
towns, many of them quite small, of
ten support two (or competitive) tel
ephone companies. Again, New York
City, ten times the size of Sari Fran
cisco, has only four times as many
telephones, when its varied business
and social importance (unequaled by
any other city In the country) demand
that it should have not merely an
equal proportion but a use of tele
phones at least ten times greater than
the ratio of any other city.
Another statistician tells us that less
than 2 per cent of the residences in
this metropolis and less than 12 per
cent of the business houses have tele
phones, and yet the company operat
ing here pays its 10 per cent annual
dividends, and frequently declares ex
tra dividends. Continuing with the il
lustration we learn that rates of ser
vice In this city, with no competition,
range up to 12% cents, per call, and
seldom, even on the largest contracts,
fall below 6 cents. A very careful es
timate shows that the present or a
new Independent company could do
business in this city profitably at 5
cents to 2% cents per call. These low
er figures, it is interesting to learn,
are based upon the employment of
apparatus performing a far larger
percentage of the work automatically
than is now employed by the present
company.â Cent Per Cent*

Rice and dried fish Is the uniform
food of the Japanese army in cam
paigning times, says the Paris corre
spondent of the Springfield (Mass.),
Union. The rice is cooked as follows:
It is boiled until quite thick and glutin
ous. Next it is placed on a ceramic
slab, rolled out and cut into squares.
The squares are then placed in the sun
to dry and often turned. When hard
as sea biscuits and greatly reduced in
weight they can be stored. A certain
number are allowed each day to the
soldier. All he has to do is to break up
a square in boiling water and add the
dried fish. In a few minutes he has
what seems to him a delicious thick
soup. If he canot produce boiling wa
ter, he simply eats his rice cake dry.
In the fruit season he substitutes fruit,
when he can obtain it, for the fish. The
Japanese soldier, M. Pichon tells me,
has muscles like whipcord, is a sure
shot, has an eye for, landmarks and a
memory for locality. He can do with
three hours' sleep out of the twenty
four, Is cleanly, attends to sanitary in
structions, is ardently patriotic, holds
his life cheap and runs up hills like a
goat. He costs the State about nine
shillings a day, and thinks himself well
off.â Baltimore American.

explained. Madame Zancig, a little

board. The professor, who la at the

wanders among the audience. He gives
some of it slates and the arithmetic
sharps fill 'em with figures. Puncturing
his temples with a weird forefinger, the
professor then says "now!" and

Mr. Zancig gets them. A man at the

VANCOUVER, B. C, July IT. â The
steamer Princess Victoria, from Se
attle and Victoria for Vancouver, ran
on a rock at Prospect Point, at the
entrance to the harbor here at 11 o'clock
this morningr. Two plates were stove
In on her starboard side and two blades
of her propeller Were broken. The
steamer waa brought to her dock and
during the afternoon, although her
pumps v.-ere kept going steadily, she
sank two feet by the bow.
Officials of the Canadian Pacific Navi
gation Company explain, the accident
by the fact that the vessel was travel
ing twenty knots against a swift out
flowing tide, when she suddenly took a
sheer to starboard, shot off at a tangent
straight into the rocks and that, owing
to her high speed and the suddenness
of the cheer, it was absolutely Impos
sible to reverse the engines or put down
the helm hard enough to port to
counteract the sheer. The steamer
struck heavily just above the place
where the steamer Beaver was wrecked.
The Princess Victoria will come to
Esquimau drydock Monday for repairs.
The officials say the damage Is very
serious. The steamer Danube took her
place on the return trip to Victoria and
Seattle this afternoon.
The Princess Victoria is the crack
ship of the Canadian Pacific fleet.
The resignation of Lieutenant Halght
Js believed to have been -the direct re
sult of the trouble created over the
Eisrhth Illinois, a negro regiment from
Â« 'hlcago. which was originally assigned
to the regular military camp at the
fair. Lieutenant Haight wrote to Colo
nel Marshall, the commander of the
regiment, to ask him if he would con
sent to occupy a camp in a remote sec
tion rf the grounds. Colonel Marshall
in reply notified Lieutenant Haight
that his regiment had abandoned its
plan to visit the fair. Friends of the
negro regiment called President Roose
velt's attention to the matter.
ST. LOUIS, July 17.â Lieutenant C.
Slfiney Haight of the Fourth United
States Cavalry, military aid to Presi
dent Francis and director of the mili
tary camps at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition, has tendered his resigna
tion to the board of directors of the
fair, upon the request of the War De
partment, which acted after hearing
the result of an investigation into the
negro problem at the exposition. This
investigation Â¦was ordered by President
Ttoosevelt. i
I wanted a divorce only because I did not
wish to continue to earn money for him in the
same way I had been doing.
1 do not know where Wong Ah Dow Is. I
stayed with my husband's relatives on Stock
ton street, going occasionally to my own room
in Spofford alley.
I am not afraid of my husband. He brings
me food every day. He would bÂ« kind to m*
if only let alone.
I have taken food to my husband many
times, and we have been the best of friends.
Last Friday nicht I was arrested at hla hM
ins place at the headquarters of the Educa
tional Society. When I returned to my hus
band's aunt's house late in the afternoon Fri
day ahe told me ray husband had been after
mÂ« several times. "What can he want with
me?" I said, and went Immediately to him.
He, with Lee Soot and Lew Ting, accused
me of putting arsenic in the soup I had taken
him on the Tuesday before. He said, "Now
tell us who told you to do it and we will do
nothing to you. Who put you up to it?"
No one had put me up to anything; and T
said so. Then a policeman showed mo his
Btar and brought me to the prison. I put no
poison in the soup. I drank some of it the
day I took It to him and I swallowed what I
drank. If I had put poison In it would I have
stayed around Iwre to bÂ« arrested? I never
thought anything further about It. for there
Is no evil In my heart toward my husband.
"^Vlth tears in her almond eyes Ah
Sow, the Chinese woman accused of
being a disciple of Lucrezia Borgia, em
phatically denied through an inter
preter yesterday that she attempted to
poison her husband, Fong Ling.
Clicking: her jade bracelets nervously to
emphasize her words, she claimed to be
the one injured. Her story, if true,
throws a light on the standing of the
Chinese wife that reveals conditions
startling and pitiful.
Ah Sow says that for years she has
been supporting her husband on her
earnings as a "Sing Song" cirl. Despite
the life she was forced to lead, she
declares that she has ever been faith
ful to her husband from the Chinese
point of view. She waa wont to leave
feasts and hurry to Fong Sing and give
him the tributes showered upon her
because of her beauty. All the time
she smiled upon other Chinamen she
had at heart the interests of her hus
band, who accepted and used the
wealth that her charms won.
She bows her head to the will of
Fong Ling with the dog-like submis
sion of the women of the Orient. "I
cry to see him every day," she says.
"He may do with me as he likes, even
to finding me guilty. I have no one
to depend upon but him and look to
him only."
Following Is Ah Sow's comnlete
statement, given through an inter
preter to The Call.
At 10 o'clock to-night the heat
showed little abatement and the opin
ion of the weather bureau forecaster
was that no marked decrease would be
no-ted for a day or two yet.
ST. LOUIS. July 16.â The hottest

day, the thermometer registering 93 de

OROVILLE, July 17.â A fire broke
out this afternoon at about four o'clock
at the Bella View Mine near Laporte.
The mill, engine room and other build
ings close to the mouth of the big tun
nel were destroyed. Four men were
working in the tunnel when the fire
broke out and fears are entertained for
thir safety, as the tunnel is strongly
timbered and it is thougnt these tim
bers will catch fire from the huge fire
now blazing. The men in the tunnel
are L. Byrnes, Morgan Bean, D. Mc-
Donald and Bert Cumley. There Is a
strong force of water at the mine for
fire protection, but the fire broke out
Just Just where the hose was placed
and It was impossible to make use of
the water supply. Word was sent to
Laporte and to Gibsbnville and a force
of men and teams from each town
hurried to the mine.

William Hammond Jr. of, Hammond & Ham
mond says that Alameda is now attracting
more attention from persons seeking an Ideal
place for a home than it has ever done before.
This inquiry Is In a great measure due to the
systematic advertising that the city Is being
given through the efforts -of the Alameda Ad-
Considerable building Is being done
and many of the homes In course of
construction are pretentious dwellings.
According to the report of Sanitary
Inspector E. C. Mailott, one hundred
and forty houses were put up in Ala
meda within the last fiscal year. This
breaks all previous records for any
corresponding period in the history of
the city. With reference to local real
estate conditions here is what some of
the. dealers have to say:
ALAMEDA, July 17. â While trans
actions with local realty dealers were
not a3 numerous during the last week
as they were during the preceding one,
the agents who buy and sell houses
and lots are optimistic and look for a
quickening in the market after the
close of the summer vacation and the
return of people to their homes and
business.
Alameda Dealers Busy.
James llcFarland of Denver, one of
the most noted of the Pinkerton thief
takers, who has charge of the Pinker

PERSONAL.
Frank . N. Dodd ot the Alameda Land Com
pany says that vacant lots are getting rarer
in Alameda dally and home Kites are Inertas
ln value. The style of the homes now being
built is more elaborate and expensive than
those constructed two years ago. This city
is becoming known as the resident place of
many of the families of United States army
officers, particularly those serving in the Phil
ippines, and several military families have
located here during the past few months.
A. R. Denke said he could not find fault
with the conditions of Alameda realty now if
he tried. It has never been healthier, and the
man who would kick about the local market
at present is not right.
Frank Hally of Hally & Co. said that the
realty market Is growing stronger steadily and
that the firm has made several good transfers
lately and had many Inquiries from parties do
elrinjr to live here. Within the last week the
firm disposed of a house and lot on Broadway,
a lot on Pacific avenue, another on Santa Clara
avenue and still another on Briggs avenue.
Captain J. S. Hanley said that business has
been excellent. Selling has been good and on
some of the lots which he had disposed of the
new owners are planning to build beautiful
homes. He stated that the class of home
seekers - at present coming to Alameda are
people of means, who mean to locate here per
manently. " -
Charles Adams & Co. said that the vacation
eeason has somewhat affected the firm's busi
ness, but still the trade could not be called
dull. As a rule June and July arc quiet
months, and real estate men k>ok for a slump,
but this year has been bitter than others In
this respect. â¢ Â¦Â¦ . . -
vancement Association and other organizations
with the promotion of the welfare of the mu
nicipality as their prime purpose Property
values are steadily increasing, "ale's are being
made daily and there is a noticeable stiffening
in rents. Modern homes are never vacant, and
the demand for cottages is far greater than
the Bupply. It Is surprising how many San
Francisco residents are casting about for a
home Elte in Al&meda.' Easterners have also
heard of the beauties of the climate, the
splendid sanitary conditions existing here and
the unexcelled educational facilities, the re
sult being that some of those who formerly
lived east of the Rocky Mountains will here
after call Alameda their home.
Six rear admirals will be retired be
fore 1905, either on acount of ill health
or because they will have reached the
age of compulsory retirement from the
active list, that of sixty-two years.
The retiring officers are Watson. Mil
lei-, Rodgers, Cooper, Wise and Terry.
The six captains who will be promoted
to rear admirals are Wilde, Davis,
Train, Plgman, Converse and Brad
ford, of which the first three named
have been five years and the other
three only four years in their present
grade. They all entered the navy in
1861, but their, service at sea varies
from, thirteen years nine months of
Captain Converse to seventeen years
nine months of Captain Train.
Two crearrferles in Iowa have been
awarded the contract for supplying the
navy with butter. The total quantity
is 350.000 pounds, besides which 250,000
pounds are furnished by Pennsylvania.
The butter must be. made within a
month, packed in three-pound tins,
sealed and placed In sawdust, and kept
in cold storage until ordered delivered
at Brooklyn or San Francisco. Cali
fornia creameries ought to compete for
this supply to the Pacific and Asiatic
stations. .
The London Engineer of June 24 has
some caustic remarks about the action
of the Board of Construction on the
torpedo-tube question, saying: "A year
or so ago torpedo-tubes were discarded
in the American fleet as useless. This
decision of a few faddists is now re
versed, it having been proved conclu
sively that the* condemnation was ar
rived at by discarding the \iews of
the bulk of .the American naval officers
and upon the flimsiest of evidence. Not
only are submerged tubes restored, but
the new ships will carry four instead
of two."
CAUSTIC CRITICISM.

is to make Norfolk the largest naval

that has been Invested at Port Royal,
Algiers and Charleston during the past
fifteen years had been spent at Nor

the best navy yards of any country.
Twenty-two warrant officers of the
gunner and warrant machinist
branches have applied for permission to
undergo examination for promotion to
the grade of ensign. Under the law
the President may commission ten
warrant officers yearly who have
passed the requisite examination for
ensign. Thus far only four have been
promoted in five years. At the Naval
Academy five young enlisted men have
passed the physicial and educational
test for admission. One of these can

Two tennis tournaments were set for
yesterday, but the absence of many of
the cracks from town necessitated a
postponement of the handicap doubles
tourney at the California Club courts.

call the event off until the cracks re
turn to town.
On the park courts the first and sec
ond class players met in a class singles

the coveted places. In the first class
the four remaining players are George

was the latter's first appearance in the
first class and he was not considered
to have a chance against Allen. Allen

SCORES AT SHELL MOUNT)
Antone Anderson, a lumberman re
siding at 710ft Brannan street, San
Francisco, was struck and instantly
killed by the 6:30 Berkeley local train
this evening at Shell Mound Park,
where he was attending the annual
picnic of the Lumbermen's Union of
San Francisco.
Anderson had left the park to take
the train to San Francisco and he at
tempted to cross the track In front
of the incoming Berkeley train; but
he misjudged the speed of the flyer,
which runs at a . high rate past
the park. He was struck before
he could get out of the way. The pilot
of the locomotive hit his legs, throw
ing him head first against the front of
the boiler. The speed of the train
was so great that Anderson did not
fall under the wheels, but was hurled
clear of the tracks, his body falling
fully twenty feet from the place where
he was struck. â¢>'-
When those who had witnessed the
accident reached the spot where he
fell. Anderson was dead, his skull hav
ing been crushed and one of his arms
broken. The Coroner was notified and
the body was removed to the morgue
in Oakland.
Anderson was forty-five years old.
He leaves a wife and several children.

demand for residence property In that section.
Henry Barkmeyer of Frultvale reports that
things look better in Frultvale. than ever be
fore. The assurance of the conversion of the.
Southern Pacific Company's lines from eteam
to electric, and the remodeling, of the Hay
wards electric lines to broad gauge and mod
ern roadbed will insure rapid transportation,
to San Francisco, to say nothing of the prom
ised Western Pacific Railroad ferry service.
These expectations have caused homeseekers
and Investors to purchase much property In
Frultvale.
ALAMEDA DEALERS BUSY.
Local dealers are well satisfied with
the summer market, and expect an in
crease in business during the fall and
winter months. Following are state
ments from several well-known real
estate firms:
George W. Austin reports an exceptional de
mand for residence property. The local situ
ation is said to be very encouraglng to Oakland
brokers, and the ceneral movement of home
buyers to this side ot the bay Is causing some
what of a stir among San Francisco people.
The improved ferry service, fine electric
car system throughout the city and the public
spirit manifested by our merchants is un
doubtedly the cause. Other reasons might be
assigned, such as the dollar a day excursion
around Oaklaiid and th* attitude of the Oak
land Board cf Trade. Building Is active, and
there i* no trouble whatever to sell new cot
tages at the risht price. Districts that have
Iain dormant for many years are being- brought
intj demand by the electric line extensions.
Mr. Austin reports the following sales recently
closed: House and lot on Market street, near
Thirty-second, for R. N\ Fitzgerald to Charles
Crow for IlMoO; lot on Thirty-fifth street near
Market, for Smith Bros, to j. H. Hlnch, ?50O;
store and flat on Sixth and Castro streets, for
L. Keyes to I... Mattioli; house and lot on
Grove Etreet, near Twenty-seventh, for W. D.
Weet to Mr. 'Child*, price withheld; lot in
Glenecno tract for Du Ray Smith to William
Allrett; lot on Telegraph avenue and Merri
mec street for O^orre W. Austin to A. Zeis,
$3100: lot on Linda avenue for J. S. Myers to
Mr. MapteFden, $1000 <on each of these lots the
purchaser v;lll build a home); house and lot

ehaw to R. Kelly for $950; house and lot in
West Oakland for T. Vaughan to Mrs. Fenton;
house and lot on Thirty-second street, near
Adeline, for J. S. Myers to William Craig.
This same, firm also sold a house and lot In
Marysvlllc, a lot in San Jose and a ranch in
Shasta County andi several other pieces of
country property. '
SALES REPORTED.
A. V. Feight, formerly vice presi
dent of the Polytechnic Business Col
lege, and J. P. Beckett, a well-known
contractor of this city, have leased a
piece of property on San Pablo aveÂ»
nue upon which they will erect a large
apartment house. The lot has a front
age of fifty feet on the east side of the
avenue and is situated between the
Santa Fe and the "Key Route" tracks.
The building, which the lesees purpose
to erect, will be a three-story frame
structure and will contain forty rooms.
The property has been leased for a
term of twenty years from E. Atwood.
Real estate dealers .have been agree
ably surprised during the past two
weeks. Where they expected a lull in
business on account of the vacation
6eason. many have been rushed with
orders. This change from the condi
tion of the summer market of past
years can only be explained in one way,
and that is that tourists who are visit
ing California are purchasing property
on this side of the bay.
A large percentage of the sales made
during the present summer have been
to people from the Eastern States who
first came to Oakland as tourists, but
who, on seeing this city's ideal resi
dence tracts, decided to locate here
permanently. Another thing that at
tracts the homeseekers to Oakland is
the fact that on every hand are evi
dences of public improvements. Among
the most important of these is the
Thirty-sixth street main outlet sewer,
which is now nearing completion.
W. H. McKinnon, of the Realty Syn
dicate, who has the contract for put
ting in the sewer, expects to have the
work finished by the end of August,
and the new outlet will then drain the
entire district north of Thirty-sixth
street. The work on the new sewer
is under the direction of Superintendent
of Streets Ott. V * â¢ .

The franchises are nominally held by
J. H. McDonald, one of the directors in
the new company. It is conceded
that the Adams people have a large
interest 'In the project It is understood
that the holder of the downtown fran
chise will g-o before the City Council to
morrow nig'ht with a petition for leave
to abandon the "corkscrew" route. At
that time the representatives of the
company will make an explanation of
its purposes. Several Councilmen have
been interviewed concerning the aban
donment of this franchise. If the
company, as is understood, shall also
cut the Pleasant Valley franchise, for
which $6000 was paid to the county in
l contest before the Board of Super
risors, it will be obliged to go before
that body, as the route Is mainly out
side of the municipal limits. If this
franchise be dispensed with the ter
mini of the new road will be at Four
teenth and | Broadway and at a point
near the head of the northeastern arm
of Lake Merritt.
By the arrangement for transfer
privileges with the Oakland Transit
Consolidated both the new road and
the old system make a gain. The re
linquishing of the "corkscrew" fran
chise leaves the Transit tracks unob
structed by the cars of the Webster
street corporation. The franchise as
originally planned takes advantage of
the five-block law, by which one street
railway company may use the tracks
of another system for not more than
five consecutive blocks.
The "corkscrew" franchise route was
so carefully mapped that it gave the
new company a chance to work up the
two main thoroughfares over the Tran
sit tracks from First street and Broad
way to Fourteenth street and Broad
way.
This route is as follows: Beginning
at the foot of Broadway, near First
street, and running up Broadway from
First to Fifth street, along Fifth to
Washington, up Washington to Tenth,
along Tenth to Broadway, up Broad
way to Fourteenth. The road continues
along Fourteenth street to Webster to
the boulevard, across Adams Point to
Pleasant Valley and thence to the cem
eteries. " , Â¦
Plans comprehending 4 the immediate
construction and operation on a new
basis of the projected Webster street
and Park Railway Company's road in
this city have matured rapidly since
the filing of articles of incorporation
last week in San Francisco. The new
company has entered into negotiations
with the Oakland Transit Consolidated,
whereby a transfer arrangement will
be effected. On this plan the new cor
poration will be able to abandon the
"corkscrew" franchise it holds over
Broadway and Washington street south
of Fourteenth street to the water
front.
This deal also includes the abandon
ment of the Pleasant Valley franchise
which the company holds. It means, in
short, that the new line will operate
from Fourteenth and Webster streets,
out Webster street to the "fill" south
of Twenty-fourth street and thence
across Adams Point, opening up the
broad acres generally known as the
Adams property bordering along the
northern shores of Lake Merritt.

The 6tory of Bercher's encounter
spread over the country and in a little
while hunting parties were scouring the
hills for the beast The brush in all
the canyons was beat up for miles
around- Only one hunter got a glimpse
of the lion, however, and that was
while it was creeping among some
brush, apparently wounded but still
able to make good time.
This mountain lion has been making
life miserable for the ranchers of
Schmidtville by stealing their sheep
and calves.
Bercher went gunning for the animal
early in the morning armed with a
shotgun loaded with small shot. Much
to his surprise he came upon the brute
Â¦while it was drinking from a. pool in
one of the small canyons back of
Bchmidtvllle. The encounter was as
much a surprise to. the lion as to Ber
cher, and the animal started to run
away.
Not counting the consequences of at
tempting to bag a mountain lion with
email shot Bercher fired, with the result
that it was only wounded in the shoul
der. Angered by the pain the animal
turned in its tracks and made one great
leap toward its pursuer. It fell short
a bit but Bercher was taken so un
twares that he fell over from fright. In
this position the animal could have
killed Bercher but it seemed more in
lent on getting away, for it merely
gave him two or three slaps with its
paws and then slunk away.
Although the slaps were few they
Â¦were not dainty. The claws tore big
furrows into the flesh, so big that the
Point Richmond doctor who treated
him says he will wear scars for the
rest of his life.
Raging mad from a shotgun wound
In his body the mountain lion that three
days ago began terrorizing the farmers
livln.: In SchmidtvUle. & hamlet Just
north of Berkeley, attacked Frank
Bercher, a ranchman, this morning and
â¢wounded him so severely that he had
io seek the services of a physician to
mend his hurts. Besides clawing a
lone strip of flesh out of Bercher*s left
cheek the animal scratched both his
aims and one of them he will wear In
a Eling for some time to come.

The German cruiser Hamburg was
delivered by the builders within six
teen months after the signing of the
contract. ""The vessel is wood
sheathed and coppered and cost about
$1,250,000. She is of 2952 tons dis
placement, 341 feet length, 43.25 feet
beam, 16.5 feet draught and her en
gines are of 10,000 horsepower, calcu
lated to give a speed of 22 knots. The
vessel's ten water-tube boilers are of
the Schulz type. At the six hours'
speed trial under forced draught on
April 26 the average results were
10,746 horsepower, 141 revolutions
and 22.3 knots' speed. On May 3, the
twenty-four hours' trial under natural
draught gave 7244 horsepower with
124.15 revolutions and 20.41 knots
speed. The consumption" was 1.82
pounds per unit of horsepower." The
maximum results of the several trials
were: 11,582 horsepower, 147.5 revo
lutions and 23.15 knots speed, the
mean draught of the vessel being
16 feet 5 inches. The armament con
sists of ten 4-inch, twelve 1.4-inch,
four machine guns and two submerged
torpedo tubes.
The Navy Department has purchased
over 270 acres of land adjoining the
Thirty- three new vessels have been
authorized to be built for -the French
navy during 1904-5. Of this number,
however, twenty-eight are submarine
boats, four torpedo boats and only one
armored cruiser. This latter ship,
four torpedo boats and eight subma
rines are to be built in dockyards and
twenty submarines by contract. The
total sum for new construction and
completing vessels in* hand is about
$13,000,000. .>-: <â¢Â¦- "'
The idea of having a vessel specially
fitted as a floating machine shop orig
inated in our navy, and was put to
practical test during'' the Spanish-
American war. A small steamer, the
Chathanr of 3530 tons displacement,
built in 18S5, was purchased May 2, 1898,
for $350,000, renamed the Vulcan, and
fitted out with machine tools. The ves
sel rendered good service for a few
months, but with the termination of the
war her usefulness ceased. The hull
was found to be in bad condition and
after expending $68,000 in vain efforts
to prolong her service, the vessel was
sold at auction July 19, 1899, for $175,
700. There is not, as far as known,
any vessel of that special usefulness in
our navy, but Russia has adopted and
Improved the Idea in the steamer
Okean; Germany has also converted
seme of her obsolete ironclads for this
important purpose, and perfection has
been' reached to a^wider. extent in the
British navy in its recent adoption of
the American suggestion, as in addition
to the stationary floating workshops a
cruising repair ship Is being built. This
vessel, named the Assistance, is of 9600
tens displacement, 4000 horsepower and
twelve knots speed and its estimated
cost Js $1,200,000.
Further changes In the regulations
for steam trials in the French navy
have been promulgated by the Minis
ter of Marine. The tests are in three
stages as follows:
First â A coal consumption trial of
six hours, under one-half Boiler power.
Second â One machinery trial of ten
hours under full power and another of
three hours with three-quarters power.
Thirdâ A run of twenty-four hours,
at cruising speed.
The time between the trials is not to
exceed three days, except under special
circumstances, which must be reported
to the Minister of Marine.
The first vessel thus tried under the
new regulations' was the armored
cruiser Conde, built at the L'Orient
dockyard, laid down March 20, 1901,
launched March 12, 1902 and tried in
May last. The trials were completed
in seven days, whereas under the old

Is of 9856 tons, 20,500 horsepower
and calculated speed of 21 knots. She
is fitted with twenty-eight . Niclausse
boilers. The coal consumption trial
showed a consumption of 35.23 pounds
per square foot of grate surface. The
full power test gave 22,800 horse

no material difference in time of com
pletion between the contract and dock
yard built ships.
NEW WARSHIPS FOR FRANCE
The British Admiralty has fitted out
three "obsolete ironclads as floating
workshops in which young, men .will be
trained for the rating of engine-room
artificers and other mechanics. The
old ships thus utilized are the Defence
of 6270 tons, built in 1862â lately re
named Indus â the Bellerophon, 7550
tons, built In 1866, and the Temeraire,
S540 tons, built in 1877. These ships
are henceforth to be designated as In
dus I, II and III, and will be stationed
at Devonport dockyard. Two hundred
boys have been entered on the Bel
lerophon, who, after passing through
the training ship, will be drafted on
to the various ships in commission,
forming nucleus crews of highly train
ed men. In this way many repairs wilj
be effected afloat which at present
necessitate a period at a dockyard.
The Bellerophon's upper deck has
been fitted out as a machinery hall with
machine tools of all descriptions, and
a galvanized iron and glass roof over
it gives the requisite protection and
light. The Temeraire will serve as an
electric- power generating station, and
also as a school for carpenters, elec
tricians and ordnance, while the De
fence will be used as a shop for the
engineer artificers employed In keep
ing the fleet reserves in repairs. The
ships will be connected by means of
bridges, thus affording easy cdmmuni
cation. The expense of fitting out
these .ships with shops, tools,, class
rooms, gymnasiums, drawing office,
meesroom, berthing .accommodations,
baths, etc., has been large, but will un
doubtedly prove an economical invest
ment, for it is not alone that special
classes of mechanics will be thus ob
tained for the . navy, but the shops
ashore will be relieved of much repair
work of minor character which hitherto
clogged the operations of the new work
and heavy repairs on machinery and
ordnance outfits. The greatest saving
and convenience, however, will be real
ized on cruising ships on which train
ed mechanics may be able to make such
repairs which otherwise would have to
be done at a shore station, involving
loss of time in steaming arid great ex
pense in consumption oÂ£ coal.

Ladles, now that our new school
houses are in embryo, it is a good time
to begin the agitation of beautifying
their grounds.
soclation to place three thousand potted bulbs
In the schoolrooms during the winter season and
to provide stereoptlcon lectures, showing how
to beautify home surroundings, and land will
be used la the near future for botanical gar
dene such as are provided In the schools abroad.
No more charming Idea could be imagined
than a garden tended by children, for Its In
fluence In developing character In boys and
girls cannot be overestimated. Because this Is
realized, various places have adopted different
methods to pursue this work. Minneapolis has
school and home gardens under ausDlces of
the Ladles' Improvement League. Early In
the spring the children In this place are re
quested to signify what seeds they desire.
The seeds are then sent In bulk to the schools
and the children make the paper receptacles
themselves. Ground Is Inspected In the spring
before planting begins and wh*n fall comes
another inspection Is given to iÂ»p what grounds
are entitled to the prl:e. the quality of soil,
work Involved to cultivate it and results all
being taken into consideration. If it is school
grounds, the prize is often a picture for the
schoolroom wallf The boys and girls work
together on the school grounds, yharing the
work, digging poet holes, laying out beds
and planting. It Is the home grounds that
are of rocÂ»t Interest to the projectors of this
garden EchÂ»me, for usually the children who
are mest anxlouo for seeds and instruction
live in desolate parts of the town and plant
the seeds in yards where the soil Is too sterile
for naturaV^jiroductlon.
This wholesome association t>f boys
and girls properly supervised in their
school garden cannot but have a
splendid effect upon their moral de
velopment. The instinct of home is
thus instilled into their young minds,
and the necessity of its adornment be
ccmes a fixed ideal â and this aside
from the practical side of beautifying
the village or city wherein the youth
ful gardeners dwell, and thereby in
creasing the valuation- of property by
making it pleasant to live in.

HOME PARTIES.
MRS. ISIDORE) MYERS, A CHAR
TER MEMBER OF NEWLY OR
GANIZED 'COO-EE" CLUB.
After quiet was restored several
speakers addressed the meeting, confin
ing themselves tc the subject adver
tised, and the meeting ended with the
adoption of resolutions condemning the
oppression of liberty, the corruption of
administration and the greed for ter
ritory of the Russian Government.
After quiet had been somewhat re
stored the chairman introduced the
next speaker, Mrs, Lewis, and hoped
that the subject before the meeting
would be adhered to-. Mrs. Lewis said
that she believed In the sentiments of
her husband, but hairing been refused
a hearing she would retire. She was
interrupted by applause. The depar
ture of the Lewises from the hall was
followed by that of over half the au
dience.
Finally the man of the long
hair and unkempt beard was silenced.
Immediately General Salomon
jumped on the platform and protested
to the meeting against the preceding
speaker, declared that tne flag for
which he had fought four long years
had been insulted and that he could
not stay on any platform on which a
speaker had attacked the institutions
of the United States. This was fol
lowed by a burst of mingled applause
and hisses, stamping of feet, hoots and
jeers.
While the presiding offlcer. Dr. J. K.
Plincz, was protesting to Lewis, cries
of "Go ahead, Lewis," "You're all
right" came from all parts of the
house.
After he had spoken for many min
utes and shown no signs of ceasing,
and after the question of the war In
the Orient had apparently been for
gotten, self respecting Poles rose In all
parts of the house and started toward
the doors. One of the former speakers.
General E. S. Salomon, left the plat
form. The house, which evidently
held a good share of anarchists, was
wildly enthusiastic and applauded un
ceasingly. This applause was taken
up by Japanese packed in the gallery,
who, blandly smiling, thought that the
enemy of their country was being ar
raigned.
A long haired individual, unshaven
and unkempt, arrayed in dirty linen
and dusty shoes, was on the pro
gramme to speak at a meeting of the
Poles and Lithuanians yesterday after
noon at Golden Gate Hall. The object
of the gathering was to adopt resolu
tions condemning the tyranny of the
Russian Government.
Everything went along smoothly and
the opening speakers -were duly ap
plauded by the patriotic Poles. Then
Arthur Lewis was introduced to the
audience. Hla name was greeted with
great applause and he began his speech
by announcing that he would treat of
a different subject from that of any of
his predecessors. He did. From brief
ly reviewing the war In the Far East,
he started a bitter tirade against this
country and its Institutions. Rounds
of applause greeted every pause In his
rabid abuse and from a quiet and staid
assembly of protesting Poles, the meet-
Ing developed into a typical representa
tion of a Chicago anarchist meeting.

the Coo-ee Club, the first of its kind
:n Americaâ the Coo-ee Club that goes
down to the dock when the liner comes
:n from Australia, bearing her sons
and her benny daughters to unknown
shores and among strange people.
"Coo-ee" is a purely antipodal word,
end of aboriginal origin, carrying a
greeting wherever uttered. In explain
ing its origin and significance, Mrs.
Isidore Myers, wife of Rabbi Myers, to
w horn is the honor due for the organiz
ation of the Coo-ees, says: "The name
of 'Coo-ec' is a woid of Australian
aboriginal origin, but now used as a
signal of recognition among all resi
d'.r.ts throughout Australia. 'Coo-ee,'
v.hcn given the proper intonation,
founds somewhat like the call of a bird
end maybe heard at the vast Austra
lian cattle stations as the herders call
for one another: or a humble cot
tage door, where a mother 'coo-ees' to
hT children, and by a responding
'coG-ee' learns their whereabouts, and

Australian travelers when a club mem

The hearts of men hark back to their
native land. -It is a phase of maternal
love implanted by the Father, and
friend, beware of the man who hath it
not. for somewhere here in his soul lies
evil-doing.
It is this wholesome, human love that
has prompted the organization of the
Srrt club of Australian wanderers to
American shoresâ the Coo-ee Club of
Pan Francisco. Now. to pronounce it
eg if you were an eligible, sound the
:*vo syllables an octave apartâ in this
way it does'nt sound unlike the call of
a Â¦wild bird.

Probably the most conspicuous example of
children's work in this direction is the Home
Gardening Association of the Goodrich Social
Settlement in Cleveland. Encouraged by suc
cessful ventures among their neighbors, this
association extended its work to the public
schools. After Interviewing the school author
ities, it was decided to have a committee take
charge of -the movement and the pupils were
notified that a package of annuals, four
o'clocks, zinnias, morningr-glories. bachelor
button* and so forth would be supplied at
the nominal cost of cne cent a package. The
first y*ar 60.000 packages were asked for.
Th*n the teachers began their work, giving
talks on the preparation of soil, effect of sun
and shade, watering, care of plants and other
details, and attention .was called to the direc
tions printed on the packages of weds. In
the fall a flower exhibit is held and Inspec
tion showg that three-fourths of the home gar
dens were successful. Aside from the educa
tional feature of this movement., the children
have enjoyed sending flowers to hospitals and
charitable institutions. The success of this
enterprise encouraged the Home Gardening AÂ»-
So far as known the George Putnam School
in Roxbury. Mass., was the first to take thi*
flower work up, and as far back as ISfll they
planted golden rod, asters, ferns and wild
flower* common to fleld and forest on their
grounds. This was the beginning of a beau
tiful wild garden which has ever since been
tended by children who use the plants In
their botanical work. In descriptive exercises
and drawing. Aside from this practical pur
pose, however, much pr'.de Is taken In this
garden from the fact that every year since
its inception it has won the annual price given
by the MassacbUKtts Horticultural Society.
Special Interest centers in the ferns In this
garden and to assist In thÂ« work the pupils
hare started ferneries at home besides owning
a collection of rare lantern slides showing
different varieties. Other towns in Massachu
setts have taken up similar work and ex
cellent school gardens are in Medford. Here
the parents contribute means to lay out the
grounds. Prosperous school gardens are also
in connection with the Boston Normal School,
in Hartford, Conn., and in Dayton. Ohio this
last place being noted for Its flower work
in connection with factories and laborers"
hon-.es.
Hew can school children be interested In
beautifying home and school surroundings?
Many communities are sacking an answer to
this question wh'eh has been solved In part
by the school and home flower garden. To
ignore the garden as an educational means In
elementary schools is unwise- We are just
bcelr.nlr.gr to see this, though Austria, Ger
many. Switzerland and France long ago adopt
ed the cultivation of children's gardens as a
part of their school curriculum.
Apropos of the work laid down by
the Outdoor Art League and affiliated
bodies in regard to the ornamentation
of schoolyards, dooryards and vacant
lots, the following excerpt from an
article published in "The Club Woman"
by Katherine Louise Smith on "Flower
Work Among Children" may be of in
terest:
Why, it is an axiom that the
best clubwoman Is she who is a suc
cess as a housekeeper, a wife and a
mother. And the very qualities that
make for her success in these essen
tials are the qualities that render her
the capable clubwoman. To be sure,
it is not supposed that she shall be
cook, chambermaid, laundress, nurse,
seamstress, teacher and comforter of
the affllicted without help. When the
clubwoman is spoken of in general
terms it is supposed that she is in
comfortable circumstances, and if the
mother of little children, is relieved of
the heavy part of her houseworkâ and
this fact is forgotten by the humorist,
who loves to depict the ragged babe,
the unwashed doorstep and the unfed
husband.
During these days of hybernating, the
club woman at home or abroad is look
ing into the vitals of other clubs, hop
ing to add to, or subtract from, that
which may add to the vitality and effi
ciency of her own club â or clubs â
since some women, and very good
women at that, belong to five or six
clubs. What about their husbands and
homes?

places and people is, one of the largest
in the city.

Many preat discoveries have been
msde by accident and things better
'han gfl'i mines havp been found In
this way: for example, wh^n even the
RCddenta] discovery that coffee is the
k&\ caus* of one's sickness proves of
most tremendous value because it lo-
cal rs th* 1 cause and the pers<< has
th^n a chance to get well.
"For over 25 years." says a Missouri
woman, "I differed untold agonies in
my Ktomach and even the best physi-
cians disagreed as to the cause without
Rix-inp me any permanent help, differ-
ent ones saying: It was gastritis, indi-
gestion. n*uraljria. etc., so I dragged
along from year to year, always half
f\ck. until finally I gave up all hopes
of *>\r>r being wel! again.
""â¢hen lakintr dinner with a friend
fjTi*t day FhÂ« said she had a new drink,
w-hStrh turned out to be Postum, and I
likÂ«-d it so well I told her I thought I
wr.iiM stop coffee for awhile and use
it, which 1 did.
"So for three months we hat Postum
in place of coffee without Â»ver having
" n * of Â«ny old spells, but was ; lways
healthy and vigorous instead.
"Husband kept saying he was con-
vinced it was coffee that caused those
rpclls. b-jt even then I v.-o-_!dn\ believe
It until one day we got out of Postum
jir.ti as we lived two miles from town I
tbuUKlit to use the coffee we had in the
.Muse.
â¢The result of a week's use of coffee
a^nin was that I had another terrible
rpiU of agony and distress, proving
:!;ct it was the coffee and lKlting else.
T!Â«at settled it and I said pood-by to

drink, coffee." Name given by Postum

Ten days' trial of Postum in place of
coffee or tea is the wise thing for every
coffee drinker. Such a trial tells the
Â«-xa.ct truth crten where coffee is not
iUEpected.

In the human being, resulting from the

consists In destroying the acarl and

The discovery has been made that a firm enjoying
municipal patronage has been sending unfit supplies to
the City and County. Hospital. Let the investigators
continue their inquiry - with vigor and they will find,
doubtless, that their discovery is neither new nor strange.
A city that is too poor to clothe its naked or to feed

upon a very ordinary practice.

All who use the microscope are aware
that the limit of Its magnifying powers
Is soon reached. Beyond a certain point
the image becomes indistinct, large but
not clear, and the lmr>erfections of the
instrument are magnified as well as the
object. Professor Dolbear has observed
that "the powers of the microscope
have not been doubled within the last
fifty years, though more time and In
genuity have been given to the prob
lem of improving it than will ever be
given in the same Interval again." It
Is dangerous, however, to ( prophesy.
One of the exhibits at the Royal So
ciety's" conversarione seemed to mark
a very distinct advance. Mr. J. W.
Gordon showed a high-power micro
scope, which had in the view field of
the ordlnarv Instrument a rotating
glass screen, and this, viewed through
a second microscope, gave a further
magnification of 100 diameters. The
ground-glass screen, by expanding the
transmitted light wave, causes it com
pletely to fill the aperture of the sec
ond microscope, so that the usual im
perfections of excessive magnification
disappear. A diatom was magnified
10.000 diameters, and its structure was
clear and well defined. The London
Engineering remarks that with the
same magnification the eye of a house
fly would eeem to cover an area of 312
square feet. If such powers can be
applied there is a new world, or at any
rate a much larger one, for the botanist
and biologist. â London Telegraph.

THE dedication of the beautiful new naval club
house at Vallejo on Saturday afternoon was an
event in which the whole State should take pride.
In j.ursuancc of philanthropic work none is more praise
worthy or to be commended than that which throws
around seafaring men every protection possible frotn the
crimpers and/land sharks that look upon them as their
especial prey. After long confinement aboard ship it is
natural that a man should feel exhilarated at breathing
the land air again and should look for new faces when he
gets ashore. That those new faces frequently mask an
enemy to lure hfm to his undoing is unfortunate but nev
ertheless often true. The remedy seems to be in the es
tablishment of places that will be more interesting than
those pitfalls which ordinarily await him.
There is more than the general element of philan
throi-y in the establishment of the Vallejo clubhouse.
The "man behind the gun" is still a most necessary fac
tor in the political economy of a country and anything
which makes for his betterment is'a valuable asset. The
Vallejo clubhouse is the culmination of lohg and cease
less effort on the part of many worthy people and it is
but right that their success should not go without due
credit' beinpr accorded them. While Rear Admirarand
Mrs. McO.lla have of course been foremost in the work
by presenting the site and managing the finances and
construction of the building, they have been nobly as
sisted by the ladies* auxiliary societies of Napa, Vallejo
and Oakland, and by others.
The naval clubhouse, built at the expenditure of so
much effort and of $63,000 in money, contains every mod
ern equipment and comfort for a first-class club and will
stand as .1 monument to the energy, philanthropy and
goodness *of those who made its erection possible.

Citizens of Memphis, weary of flagrant gambling and
its attendant troop of crimes, have found relief in union
and in emphatic terms have demanded the resignation
of the Chief of Police, the Mayor and the Sheriff for
palpable inability to perform their manifest duty. When
one reflects upon this highly encouraging situation the
thought is irresistible that some people in San Francisco
have reason to be deeply thankful that they are not in

The lady was a tactician. Living on
the mountains overlooking the Presidio
she had probably absorbed something
of the military, cleverness of the offi
cial quarters of the army post.
She found a spare strap and hung
on, her supple body swaying gently to
the sidewlse swing of the car. She
looked at the occupants of the seats,
but every man was deep in the columns
of his morning paper. Noting a yoang
man, a very young man, in front of
her, she let her beautiful eyes rest on
him. He blushed but kept his own gaze
on the paper he was trying to read.
Presently her handkerchief, a dainty
creation of linen and lace, fluttered to
the floor.
Miss Tactician did not see it drop,
but the young man, the very younjr
man, did. Chivalry would not permit
him to read longer, and besides her
smart appearance was working on his
nerves. He arose and stooped for the
handkerchief.
Here was her opportunity, and she
embraced it. While his back was turn
ed she slipped smoothly into his seat.
"Thank you," she murmured, as she
tcok the handkerchief; "you are very
kind."
He immediately jumped oft* the car.

nation, for he had seen indications of
smile on the faces of the observing
passengers.

"Down with it, gentlemen," he cried;
and the glasses were drained without
embarrassment and without disloyalty.

Queer Things in the Mail
"Queer things come through the
malls," said Postofflce Superintendent
Hull McClaughry. "Only a short time
ago the clerks In the registry depart
ment were obliged to get outside the
building In order to air themselves. The
odor was fierce, in fact terrific. Two of
the boldest clerks plugged their nos
trils with cotton and made a search
among the registered packages for the
fountain of perpetual stench. Well,
what do you think they found? It was
a large package, rather heavy and soft
and yielding. Xo; It wasn't_ Limbur
ger cheese. That would "be attar of
roses compared with the real thing.
It was a package from Arizona ad
dressed to Shanghai, China, and con
tained\two skunks!
"No, they weren't alive, and hadn't I
been put Into the package when they
were alive. They had been killed and
dressed and dried for an hour or so
under the Arizona sun and then for
warded by a Chinese fatalist to a su
perstitious friend In China. They be
came mellow on the road. Of course,
we couldn't throw the mephitlc var
mints into the street. Under the rules
we were obliged to send a written re
port to Washington and await Instruc
tions. That consumed twelve days,
and you may imagine the condition of
the office until orders came to bury or
cremate the offensive package."
"Not bad, like the skunks, but odd,"
said A. M. Cox, superintendent of city
delivery, "was a package that I saw
going through the registered mail ad
dressed to Campbell Hot Springs. They
were three loaves of Italian bread, each
three feet long, and the address was
written in Ink on each loaf. I remem
ber at another time a package of
dried mushrooms from Italy that
smelt very bad. I have seen also spag
hetti, macaroni and other provisions
sent by registered post.
"In Germany, where they have a
parcels post system, anything that can
get inside of the door of the mail car
may be sent by mail, such as a cow or
a goat. I heard of a man there who
used to send twenty miles every day
for his beefsteaks and get them by
registered parcels post."
DOWN in Georgia a gentleman after living a quiet
linnoted life has recently achieved something of
distinction by dying on the ninetieth anniversary
of the day of his birth. His venerable age and the co
incidence of the dates of his birth and his death led to
some investigation into his mode, of life, and it was then
learned that from the time of his infancy he had never
been sick, nor had he ever in all those years taken a
single dose of what his biographer calls "doctor's med
icine."
To have maintained himself hale and hearty through
$0 long a period, in a society so disturbed as has been
that of Georgia during. the vicissitudes of the civil war
and the reconstruction period, is certainly an achieve
ment worth noting; and the means by which he achieved
it deserve attention from all who wish to avoid doc
tor's medicine, live to be ninety and die on the anniver
sary of their birth. It is therefore gratifying that the
Atlanta Constitution has sought out the peculiarities of
the veteran's way of living and has published them for
the benefit of a world of men, among whom there is too
much medicine and too little length of life.
From the investigation we learn that the long-lived
citizen was familiarly known as "Uncle Jack," and it is
a natural inference that he started life with a disposi
tion so genial and sympathetic that everybody felt some
thing of kinship for him. That of course helped him to
live comfortably, but it was not enough to assure him
ninety years of life, for a good many such genial fel
lows die young. It was further learned that he never
used either tobacco or coffee, but that "he would take a
drink of liquor whenever it suited his purpose." Those
habits also were doubtless of good service to him, but
still they do not account for his feat of living nine dec
ades and then dying on the anniversary of his birth
day.
We are told that before the war he was a Whig, but
ever since the war Re was a Democrat. He was once a
County Clerk, then a County Treasurer, and then a Jus
tice of the Peace, his various terms of office covering a
period of more than forty years. That- is a good record
as records go in rural districts, but the mere enjoyment
of the spoils of office for forty years and over is not
enough to sustain a man in healthy life for ninety years.
There is still something to be sought for as a complete
explanation of his good fortune, and it is to be found
in the statement of his biographer: "He- never ate a
chicken in his life."
Just how a man of hearty appetite could live in Geor
gia for ninety years without ever eating a chicken is a
difficult thing" to understand, but the story comes to us
on the authority of a contemporary that has' always
been found reliable when not discussing politics. We
give the theory therefore for what it is worth: "If you
would live long beware of chickens."
â¢Railway earnings for the first week in July were 6 per
cent below those for the same week in 1903 and 'the
gross earnings for the fiscal year just closed will prob
ably show an increase over any previous year, but wages
and the cost of material have undergone such changes
during the year that it is not possible now to determine
the net result of the country's rail traffic.
The distributive markets continue quiet, as usual *&t
this time of the year. Collections are reported rather
slow than otherwise. The best commercial reports are
now coming from the South, where the situation is
dominated by the cotton crop*, which, as already stated,
is very promising. The country's bank clearings for the
week were only 1.7 per cent below those for the cor
responding week last year and the aggregate clearings
again ran up over the $2,000,000,000 mark. They have
not done this for some time, and the sign is a good one.
The failures for the week were 225, agamst 223 last year.
The buoyant tone in Wall street, noted during the past
several weeks, was apparent during the whole week.
With conditions as unseltled as they were over the
change in the wheat crop outlook, the provision strike,
the decision in the Northern Securities case and the re
cent large liquidation the market shows surprising
vigor and firmness and the sentiment was bullish all over
the street, with everybody predicting a better market
sooner or later. There is not a vestige of pessimism
left in Wall street. Everybody wants the market to go
up and almost everybody expects that it will. There is
a large leaven of caution still observable, however, and
it continues to dominate the situation. A burned child
tears the fire.
A curious financial mare's-nest has just been uncov
ered by the New York Evening Post. It has discovered
that a number of large trust companies in New York are
carrying" enormous sums of idle money, on which they
are paying about 2 per cent interest, standing on their
books as "cash on hand and in banks." It has been known
for a year that the amount of money idle in New York
is vast and the location of this idle money is now known.
The Post says that six important companies holding
$136,039,000 deposits have $47,085,000 "in cash and in
banks." Ordinarily these companies would have scarcely
$13,000,000 so apportioned, for on the present basis the
business shows a heavy loss. Another company, which
withdrew from the clearing-house recently because of
its unwillingness to carry a 10 per cent reserve, shows
that market conditions have forced it to keep 20 per cent
of its deposits idle in bank, besides a large cash balance
in vault.
Of two evils it is probably better to have too much
money than not enough, especially from a mercantile
point of view, but when money accumulates in this
wholesale fashion it is about time to look about and as
certain the cause of the accumulation and see if some
way cannot be devised to get it into general circulation,
where it will not be a temptation to everybody handling
it. Large blocks of idle" money lead to reckless stock
and other speculation, to vast and indiscriminate flota
tions of new enterprises and' all sorts of undesirable
tilings. It is like a healthy, strapping boy hanging about
the house doing nothing. He is apt to get into mischief
and had better be put to work.
THE business situation was more interesting last
week than for some time, as conditions were more
diversified. The rapid changes in the crop outlook
and the great packers' strike in the West unsettled con
ditions which had apparently become settled for some
time to come and the week was another illustration of
the fact that we never know what is going to happen.
As to the crop outlook, it mafy'be said that heavy rains,
by overflowing fields, delaying harvests and causing
wheat to sprout in the shock have reduced previous es
timates of the size of the crop. .The Government report
of the condition of the crop July i indicated a yield of
0i6,ooo,ooo bushels, but all the recent damage has hap
pened since then, hence this estimate no longer stands.
Snow, the statistician, estimates the loss throughout the
country at from 50,000.000 to 100,000,000 bushels, while
Jones of the Commercial West estimates the crop at not
to exceed 582,000,000 bushels.
The presidents of several of the great railroad systems
which depend upon the wheat and corn crops for a large
share of their annual business say that the loss to the
transportation companies through the reduction of the
grain output will be serious. These statements may af
fect the quotations for the Western railroads in Wall
street later on, but thus far the shares have shown but
little effect of the weather conditions. Again, those sec
tions where the damage has been more acute will prob
ably not send in very bright commercial* reports during
the rest of the year, so the conditions in the West are
considerably unsettled. During the past day or two,
however, the weather has been better and there is a dis
position to believe that perhaps the damage has been
overestimated. â¢ >
As for the corn and-totton crops, they are in good
condition and conditions based on them are reported
highly encouraging. The wool industry continues very
active, with a continued eager demand for fleece and a
further advance in prices of 5 per cent at the wool sales
in London on the 14th.
The feature of the week, however, was the great strike
at the Western provision centers. The direct results
were the immediate advancement in prices for meats
throughout the West and East and the throwing of
thousands of men out of employment. Cured meats,
however, actually declined on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the packers reporting large stocks of hog pro
duct!?. The San Francisco provision operators, who are
closely posted as to affairs at the Western packing
points, say that if the strike does not continue too long
it will be very beneficial to the great packers by enabling
them to clear off these accumulated stocks, a large por
tion of which are medium and lower grade goods. A
week or so of idleness at the great packing plants will
therefore not be apt to worry the packers. The strike
is interfering with the deliveries of hides to the tanners
and those who are short of supplies are anxious over the
situation, which may result in a shortage in leather and
an advance in the price of hide?.
Conditions in the other industries are irregular. Fall
River mills are unsettled by proposed wage readjust
ments and there is more or less idleness among the iron
] and steel plants, with the belief that fpig iron warrants
will be smaller than for any recent month. Building
operations are now not sufficiently lively to increase the
call tor structural material, and the demand for lumber,
a* well as for iron and steel, is much less than for sev
cfal ye^rs p2St. Exports of manufactured goods, how
ever, are reported larger than in any previous year. In
fact, foreign trade totals for the fiscal year are next to
the largest ever reported, and the figures for the port of
New York show gains of $530,286 in exports and $1,906,
724 in imports, as compared with the corresponding
. week a year ago. $
We have seen how even the wary
Whip may fall a victim to the wiles of
the practical Joker: but when that
astute and resourceful person takes a
hand in a game his efforts are general
ly successful. A clever strategem of
the chief Opposition Whip led to the
defeat cf the Disraeli administration.
A big division was expected, and the
Government Whips had organized a
special service of messengers for the
purpose of summoning their wandering
flock from dinner, club, party or
theater, according as their tastes or
social engagements led them, so that
every available vote might be recorded.
At that time the nimble bicycle was
not in general use. and the messengers
were generally sent in cabs.
When the hour of the division drew
nigh, not a solitary cab wes seen in
the neighborhood. The Opposition
Whips had chartered them all, and
got them safely out of the way, so
that Palace Yard was bereft*of every
single vehicle. â London Answers.
They turned out to be two country
people up for a holiday in London,
who had planned to watch a debate
from tht- Strangers* Gallery. While
they were waiting in the lobby for
their member to obtain passes for the
gallery, some joker among the loungers
there had directed them to "go straight
on" into the CRamber itself. .In their
rural simplicity this they did. but to
this day it remains a mystery how they
managed to evade the vigilance of the
doorkeepers.
The lately rejoicing Opposition looked
puzzled and anxious, for their own
candidate had in reality been defeated.
The reckless jesters aforesaid had ar
ranged for a confederate to dispatch a
bogus result to be wired to the Chief
Whip of the beaten party so soon as
the counting of the votes had advanced
far enough to give the result. The
official telegram giving the real result
did not arrive, as we have seen, till
after the anxious Liberals had been
imposed upon.
Only once have strangers been dis
covered on the sacred floor ef the Cham
ber itself. The hair of honorable gen
tlemen stood on end one afternoon
when some one pointed out two very
respectable looking members of the
public calmly listening to the debate
from one of the benches below the
gangway.
The most audacious hoax ever per
petrated on the House was the inven
tion of a couple of irresponsible jour
nalists. A more than usually impor
tant i>ye-election was pending, and It
was known that the result would be a
close thing, though, as is usual in such
cases, both sides were confident of vic
tory. Mr. Balfour. then Chief Secre
tary for Ireland, was speaking when a
telegram was handed to the chief
Liberal Whip.
"We've won!" he cried, waving the
pink slip over his head, while his
party roared their exultation again
and again. Suddenly through the doors
darted Sir Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, his
glasses gleaming with excitement. He,
too, flourished a telegram; he, too,
beamed triumph all around; and from
the Conservative hosts there rose
another and a louder shout.
Only p. count. I'll pair with you
;f you like." airily responded "Labby."
The. novice accepted, and, the small
number of members present bi'ing
thus reduced by two, the House was
duly counted out. It was only when
he cume to reflect that you cannot
pair for a count that the young Con
servative realized how very neatly ho
hail been done by the artful La
bouehere. â¢
Ons afternoon the devotion of-hon
orable members to their Parliamen
tary duties was somewhat slack, and
only a handful of semi-somnolent leg
islators dotted the green benches. For
rcme renson the Liberals were trying
to obtain a "count out." while their
politicals opponents endeavored to
"keep ft Hotl^e." As everybody knows,
if the Speaker's attention 1? called to
the fnc.t that there nre not forty mem
bers present, the House may be
counted out. Things being thus, in
the lobby Mr. Lnbouchere ran across

that his dignity would not allow him

so it Is appropriate enough that from

he saw the child struggling in the
water. Realizing at once its perilous
position he plunged into the creek with
his clothes on and made every effort
to rescue the drowning boy, but be

Mr. Kelly, also connected with' the
flour milling industry of this State, said
that wheat must go through a sweat
ing process. "The baker makes a flour.
The pluten stretches and he cuts it
and throws it but he never breaks it.
That is what he wants the gluten In
Davis said that there is a difference
In gluten. From the commercial point
of view gluten Is composed of two sub
stances, called gliadin and glutenln.
"Glutenin." he said, "is the stiff end
and Rliadin is the sticky end of it. The
ability of gluten to hold together de
pends upon the percentage of gliadin.
If there is too much it will not stand
up, but runs. Irrigated wheat is what
we call 'punky.' Millers do not buy
it. Wheat in the imperial is very hand
some, but it does not make flour. The
percentage of gluten in wheat that Is
ample- for the housewife will not do for
the baker. The baker wants a high
percentage of gluten so that he can use
more water. The wife does not want
too much because it takes too much
muscle to mix it."
You take club wheat flour without the
proper amount of gluten, the bubbles are very
Email and it does not rise. That's because the
gluten in club wheat Is not sufficient "to hold
the big bubbles, but wheat with 14 per cent
good strong gluten you will find a good hole
in your bread. Club wheat bread if It Is
raised properly is Just as wholesome as the
other. Experiments have been made at dif
ferent times and In different places, at Min
neapolis, In Washington, In Germany, aa to
the value of white flour bread and graham
flour bread. They tried the experiment on
four young- men and ascertained the fact b>Â±
yond question, as far as Investigation could
make it, that a far greater percerftage of
the white flour hread was absorbed Into the
eystem and went In as nutriment, while a
larger percentage of the graham flour bread
wan thrown off. so we may regard that ex
periment as being finally settled. The greater
nutriment is with the white flour bread, but
these same things that are thrown off of the
human system the cow can digest.'
LACKING IX GLUTEX.
Hour is composed of two substances, starch
and cluten, and the percentages vary. There
is probably about one-eighth gluten and seven
elghths starch. The starch forms the fat
which keeps the fire burning; gluten forma
muscle and is a strength giving: element.
Gluten is necessary for the raising of the loaf.
Thus grains like rice and. corn that hava
gluten don't stick together. In making bread
you mix into tho dough something that pro
duces gas, it may be some chemicals, but
whatever it Is it produces gas inside of the
mass of dough and the gas gets entangled In
the Inside of the gluten, which is all through
the mixture and forms a bubble.
You take a loaf of bread and cut It open
and every bubble Is lined with something like
the balls the children play with, which looks
like India rubber. That is gluten. The little
bubbles of gas come together and get caught
and are held by this gluten and raise the loaf
up. This Is the process of raising/ bread.
Whan the housewife flnds It at the proper
point she puts it In the oven and the oven
keeps all that gas Inside. You close the oven
door and It stors the gas from escaping. You
brown It and then the heat penetrates the loaf
and hardens It, and then you put It on the
table and cut It open and you have it all full
of these bubbles of gas, each of which is in a
bag of gluten.
As to the office that the gluten per
forms in the manufacturer and uses of
flour Mr. Davis gave practical infor
mation:
One great question is whether there is a
commercial fertilizer that will assist In pro
ducing gluten, but there is another question
affecting the wheat crop of California that Is
very important and which I think this board
cculd take up. the question of using the
proper seed. Mr. Davis has ; told you before
how the farmers will go across, the fence and
get his nelchbor'8 seed and thinks he haÂ«
chanced his seed. If his neighbor has had a
i/ooi crop he will plant the poor seed and then
eypect a good crop to come from tho poor seed.
Take the corn crop of the United States, for
Instance. That crop Is increasing in quality
year by year because the farmer has exer
cised a great deal of care in tho selection of
the seed he plants for the next year. He has
increased the yield and tho quality. The wheat
farmer of California never thinks of that.
The thing to do is to take a small portion of
the field and plant seed for the next year,
cultivate It, fertilize it, if necessary irrigate
It. and then he will get the proper wheat crop.
Our wheat crop la deteriorating not only in
its gluten, but in the yield per acre.
Merchants' Exchange, added some light
to the situation that all farmers will
now consider. In part Mr. Friedlander
said:
In the foregoing Davis gives the prin
cipal facts to explain the present situa
tion and provide a basis for under
standing and good work In behalf of
the State. When he addressed the
State Board of Trade many questions
were asked by members of the board
that tended to elicit facts more effectu
ally than they ordinarily could be
brought out in a formal essay or con
versation. Davis told the board what
has been done experimentally since it
was discovered that there was need for
importing wheat to make flour having
the required strength to suit market
conditions. In this connection Davis
skid:
I called thÂ» attention of the men at Berke
ley to these conditions some five or six years
ago and they said they were experimenting
with wheats in their experimental grounds.
I sent East and got Kansas wheat and dis
tributed it In our different mills. We asked
cur agents to distribute it to the farmers and
try to get them to sow It, which they have
done in many Instances. Wheat acts dif
ferently on the same soil. Some will Â«tand
drought and tone will not. Rome will send
out nurfac* roots and some will not. One has
to study the Â«Â«oil and climate.
I wrote this year "o the university and
said that If they would pick out for us â¢ a
half dozen or dozen different varieties of wheat,
that were slror.g and they thought would stanV
transportation to this Htate, I would send them
out, and we have pent out Â«uch samples, some
to the farmers and In some cases hired men
to sow it. and in name places planted it our
selves, so we ohall have in a Rood many
sample* this year and know something about
the hhndling of it. But I want to Bay to
you that all these wheats Mcach out in this
country: the quality changes. All these strong
wheats become starchy In California.
We should educate the farmers to getting
a. new peed. One great difficulty 1Â« they don't
rtiift the seed. Sometimes they take the seed
from their next-door neighbor. whereaB If they
pot It from pome other part of the State they
â¢would do better. The Oregon wheats do very
well here. They are stronger than our wheats.
Most of the wheat raised around Chlco ie club
wheat. I should think about 80 per cent of It
was club wheat.
USES OF FERTILIZERS.
T. C. Friedlander, secretary of the
The flour millers are importing wheat from
Kansas and South Dakota in very considerable
quantities to blend with our flour and for
tify It and give strength to its glutinous qual
ity. \\> pay a good deal more for It than
for wheat in this State. It U not as white
cr as plump, but It is 6tronger. Now, that Im
pressed tf.e very much es being a wrong con
dition, of things. The wheat from new land
Is always strong. When I first went Into the
business hero forty-odd years ago the wheat
was stror.g. It was then mainly obtained
from Australia and what Â«e raised was mainly
Australian wheat and was of pretty fair
strength. Then as time went on we got to
raising Chile wheat and then more club wheat
and the quality of the seed of the kind raised
steadily decreased. Gentlemen of farming in
terests know why they raise club wheat.
It is suffer and it stands the drought pretty
well, not as well as the Australian, and the
chaff holds the berry in the head stronger, so
that when It is thrashed it doesn't thrash onto
the ground as other grains do. and on the
whole the farmer thinks he gets a better
yleM from club wheat than from Australian.
It has reached a point where club wheat has
come to be common and poor. Let me 8ay
now that the crop of this State this year Is
not going to be large enough to supply our
seed and food and we have to Import wheat
to make the ordinary average quantity of flour
we make in this State.
We began to feel the effects of this three
or four years ago in the importation of East
ern flour, and you Bee It here and there along
the streets. ''Minneapolis flour" or "South Da
kota flour," and as a sure sign that some
thing was needed to Improve our flour It did
not come In until three or four years ago.
When I went down to Los Angeles I found
they were freely Importing it there to mix
with California wheat. We took the hint
from that and began to import flour to mix
with our flour. We didn't like that, so we
imported the wheat and made our flour out
of the wheat and made better flour than wÂ«
could out of California wheat straight and
improved the quality of cur food.
WHAT HAS BEEN" DONE,
IMPORTATION' OF WHEAT.
Some liberal extracts are given here
with of the statements that Horace
Davis ha^, made to the California State
Board of 'Trade, that all in interest
may understand the requirements as
they are set forth. Concerning the im
portatio-n of wheat from other States
into California Mr. Davis said:
ments there would appear no reason
why results might not be accomplished
in the case of wheat." -,
A blow from the fist of Welford Glos
ter sent J. A. Funk reeling to the pave
ment at Post and Kearny streets early
yesterday morning. Funk's head
struck the curbstone with such force
that his skull was fractured. He died
at 11:40 a. m. at the Harbor Emergency
Hospital.
Funk left a saloon at Geary and Mar
ket streets, where he had been linger
ing since midnight, and proceeded
along Kearny street with Welford
Gloster and Harry Keppler. The three
were bound for their lodgings at a
lodging house on Bush street. As the
trio neared Post street W. H. Clark and
his wife, who were on the opposite side
of Kearny street, saw Gloster suddenly
strike Funk, who reeled backward. The
man's head crashed against the granite
curb. Gloster hurried along Kearny
street toward Bush street and Keppler
took the opposite direction.
dark and his wife hurried across to
the injured man. Seeing that he was
badly hurt Clark started in pursuit of
Gloster, while Mrs. Clark remained
with Funk. Nearing Sutter street Clark
met Policeman Dougherty, to whom he
gave an account of the occurrence: The
policeman arrested Gloster Just as he
turned down Sutter street. He was
taken to the City Prison.
Funk was. taken to the Harbor Hos
pital. He recovered consciousness only
long enough to tell his name. His skull
was badly fractured at the base and
he died just before noon. At the City
Prison Qloster denied that he struck
Funk or that he was with him when
he "was injured. He admitted having
spent some time, just before the as
sault was committed, in company with
Funk, Keppler and a telegraph operator
whose name he does not know. He says
that he and Keppler together left a
saloon at Geary and Kearny streets,
leaving Funk at the bar.
Clark positively identified Gloster as
the man who sent Funk to his death
by a blow. Funk was about 40 years
of age and unmarried. He was em
ployed by the "Wrenn Commercial Com
pany. Gloster is a compositor for the
Hayden Printing Company. All of the
men concerned in the affair had been
drinking rather heavily. Gloster denies
ttiai he had any serious quarrel with
Funk.
A communication has been received
from Professor Shaw by General Chip
man in w hich the following statements
are made: *'By a system of rational

Concerning the offer of the millers
to appropriate J'Â»00, Horace Davis says:
"Professor Shaw, from the University
of California, came to see me about this
grluten question. He said that the Uni
versity people wanted to experiment
â¢upon improving the wheat by selection.
They were satisfied that to improve the
wheat by importation of the seed would
not entirely solve the problem. They
were of opinion that the wheat would
jro bark to too large a percentage of
etareh and have too small a percentage
of gluten to make strc-ng flour that is
demanded. But they believe that it
will be -possible, by the careful selec
tion of wheats, to find a strong wheat
that will hold on in this State and will
continue to reproduce itself strongly.
For instance. Burbar.k produces his
fruits by selection. Professor Shaw
said that he wanted a little money to
make the experiment in selection and
that if he could get $500 the first year
and J2. r Â»0 for the next four years, he
could carry on his experiments. I
c-ommunicated with General Chipman.
WÂ« will raise the 5500 among the
trade."
The California Slate Board of Trade
has been informed by Horace Davis
thai ihe flour millers of California have
cgreei to donate $500 to enable Pro
fessor Shaw (xt the University of Cal
ifornia to ascertain by experiment
whether California wheat can not be
made to possess a greater percentage
of gluten by the process of selection.
The State Board of Trade has decided
to expend certain sums of money to
Import seed wheat frcrcn countries
vhere the grain has much gluten, the
purpose being to distribute the seed
among farmers to see what results can
be achieved. The experiments In se
lection to be carried on by the Univer
sity of California will take several
years of work. In the meantime im
mediate good results may be brought
about by the use of fresh seed. These
Are the new facts in a matter of great
importance to California, involving the
fTJture of wheat farming in this State
to a large extent.
The State Board of Trade has de
voted much time recently to looking
into the statements of California flour
millers that they are compelled to im
port large quantities of wheat from
Kansas and So-uth Dakota to blend
with California wheat to make strong
Hour, such as is demanded by a large
trade. As has already been reported
lu The Call, a conference took place
between the State Board of Trade and
flour millers on this subject last week.
The appointment of a, committee of
practical men was authorized to in
vestigate. Pending: this investigation
the committee, which is headed by
General X. P. Chipman, has met. "Wide
spread interest will attach to all the
subsequent proceedings. Horace
Davis tells the State Board of Trade
that both the quantity and quality of
wheat produced in California is, from
the miller's point of view, falling off.
There are many problems of engrossing
interest to be considered. Some of
these were presented at the recent con
ference brought about by the State
Board of Trade. The importance of
the matter warrants the publication,
at length, of many of the statements
that were made by Horace Davis.
They are of live concern to all farmers
in California who gro-w wheat for the
use of the flour millers. Not less will
they attract the attention of all per
sons who are trying to promote the
prosperity of this Siate.
MIDLERS OFFER MONEY.
Mr Davis has said that in the earlier days
when our land was stronger our wheat was
stronger. Mr. Frledlander has called atten
tion to tho gradual diminution of the amount
of wheat as well as the inferiority of the
quality. I know that on land In Tehama Coun
ty In the earlier days they used to get thirty
to forty sacks to the acre; now that same
land produces eight to ten sacks to the, "acre,,
and the wheat iÂ» not as good. Now, the point
la this: If in the early days when the land
was virgin It produced a satisfactory wheat
of sufficient strength, there Is no reason in
the world why the chemical elements which
were In the soil at that time can not be put
back by artificial fertilization. So that with
fertilization and the principles of selection
suggested it would seem to me this question
should be further Investigated and if possible
Eome recommendations be made.
Preliminary to Inviting Mr. Davis to address
the board some time ago, my attention Waa
called to the fact that we were Importing
wheat from Kansas and South Dakota and
powlbly other States east of the Rocky Moun
tains to California for the purpose of blending
It with the California grown wheat to make u
flour acceptable to the bakers and consumers
In thia State, and that It had been found to be
a necessity to put themselves at additional ex
pense In order to produce a tsatlsfactory grade
of flour.
Prior to the adoption of resolutions
introduced by Manager Briggs, calling
for the appointment of a committee by
the State Board of Trade to investigate
as to what can be accomplished in
the premises, some general statements
of interest were made by General N. P.
Chipman. He said in part:
REVIKAVKD BY CHITMAX.
Mr. Davis â Yes.
Mr Mills What the Agricultural College is
trying to do is to develop, by cultivation, a
variety of wheat In which the gluten will exist
in thlo climate. 1 think this board might do
something towards securing a legislative ap
propriation iu favor of developing a variety of
wheat that would contain sufficient gluten and
would not lose It by continuous cultivation
Mr. Millsâ Will fertilization of any kind add
to the gluten in wheat?
Mr Davis â There is undoubtedly something
that 'is due to the soil, because certain sec
tions of the State produce gtuUnous wheat.
Wheat grown on Hsht soil is starchy, and
that grown on new land is stronger than wheat
grown on old land. Wheat grown on red land
is strong wheat.
Mr Millsâ Tha the character of the soil has
every'thins to do with the production of
B Jlrâ¢ 'Davisâ Something. Fertilization would
have something to do with it. Chemically
speaking, tho starch Is the last thing nature
makes. If you cut the wheat green you al
ways have a stroneer' berry than if It is rip?.
The longer It is In the field the more starch
you have. Starch Is the last thing that is
produced in the berry. When the wheat is
rnarly ripe it has more gluten In percentage
than at tho end of the process. In jr.- opinion,
the wheats of Oregon are stronger because the
season is Bhorter.
Mr. Sharp â I want to say that when I was
In the milling business in tlve Kast we cut
the wheat green because It made better flour;
tetter than when it was ripe.
Mr Mills â It Is the absence of storms In
the harvest season that makes our season
longer. I havts seen wh-eat stand In October,
so that your (statement that the starch is pro
duced later would clve us a starchy wheat.
Mr. Davis â If we could mix In. say 10 per
cent of good strong wheat, it would help the
flour very much.
Mr. Millsâ What we want to do to prevent
Eastern importation is to raise wheat contain
ing the proper amount of gluten. Then we
can make flour without the importation of for
eign wheats.
Mr. Davis â We have some wheat at Paso
R0W03 now that was brought from Kansas and
plantPd by a farmer. It will be harvested
this year an-i make a beautiful wlwat.
Mr Turnerâ I think the matter has been
covered by Mr. Davis. However, I think that
the selection of seed has a great deal to do
with the quality of the jvheat. We have Im
ported seed from Oregon two or thre* times;
and from Washington.
Incidental to the discussion before the
State Board of Trade relating to what
can be done to promote the interests
of wheat in California the following
conversation took place:
Mr. Mills â What proportion of Eastern wheat
is necessary to make the proper bUnd?
Mr. Davis â That deptnds on tho kind of
Calitornia wheat you uss. Tou take common
club T/heat; it contains over 6 or 8 per cent
dried KlutÂ«n in it, while thai from tha East
has 14, 15 or 1G per cent.
Mr. Kellyâ Thirty-flve per cent wet gluten
would be about 12 per cent dried gluten; 12
per cent is pretty good.
Mr. Davisâ Now then we take that and we
put in. it It Is very stronc flour. 25 or 30 per
cent of Eastern wheat and that would make
very high flour. Five or 10 per cent is used
in many cases.
General Chipmanâ By Australian wheat you
mean wheat from that variety of seed?

THE California State Board of Trade has practically decided to
import seed wheat as an immediate means to give back to
California farmers the home market for wheat raised for
millers' and bakers' use and also to provide for the Oriental
flour trade. The Hour millers of California have agreed to contrib
ute $500 toward c.\|>eriments to be conducted at the University of
California, on the lines of natural selection, that California wheat
may permanently possess the proper perrcntaffc of the/ constituent
known as gluten, which is , hides peiisnble for the maklns of strong
floor. These are the first recorded moves toward holding for-n great
home Industry its own field as asainst importations from Kansas and
South Dakota. The situation has become sufficiently serious to lead a
conservative man, Horace Davis, who is entirely conversant with
wheat crowinj; and with flour making in California, to declare that
the crop in this State, this year, is not jjoing:. to be larjje enough to
supply our seed and food and that wheat must be imported to make
the ordinary average of California flour. During the past three or
four years Minneapolis flour and South Dakota flour has been coinins
into California for sale. Eastern wheat has been lively imported
to Los Ahffdes for the use of flour miller*, and it has also been
brought in for the flour mills at all leading mill centers north of the
Tehachapi pass.

It is frequently the case that a party wishes
to sell his holdings for the purpose of reinvest-
ing the proceeds in a different kind of property.
Our long experience In this business enables
us to often accomplish this double purpose by
only one transaction. The only we
make is that your property, if you wish us to
dispose of it for you. MUST BE GOOD OF ITS
KIND AND IN A GOOD LOCATION. Don't
take up either our time or your own with
worthless offerings, or property so heavily
mortgaged as to leave no actual equity.
If it has merit, whether you own real estate
or a mercantile or manufacturing business,
bring a description of same to r>ur offlc?, stat-
ing what kind of property you prefer In ex-
change, and you will be surprised how quickly
we can effect the result.
THIS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE UNDER-
STAND THE EXCHANGE BUSINESS and are
the only company In San Francisco making a
specialty of same. We make no charge for adÂ»
vertlslng or any other purpose unless we pro-
cure an exchange satisfactory to you to ac-
cept

The Norwegian turret steam collier Tltanla.
arrived yesterday from Nanalmo. She Is com
manded by Captain P. M. Foyn. he having
superseded Captain H. Egenes, who has re
turned to Norway. She brought down 6222
tons of coal for the Western Fuel Company.
The Tltanla had fine weather except during
the first day out, when the vessel had an op
portunity to test her qualities as a steady sea
boat. She cannot roll to any extent in rough
water on account of her unusual shape. When
she dips to one side and starts to swing the
other way the peculiar extension of the hull
beyond the rail is loaded with tons of water.
This weight checks the roll considerably or
slows down the motion and steadies the ship
in a. aea way.

William Douglas of 425 Pacific street yes
terday walked from Lombard-street wharf to
the Harbor Hospital with a fish pole In one
hand and a nsh hook in the other. It was not
his polo nor was it his hook, but he did not
wish to cut the line. But William Douglas
stuck to the pole and the hook stuck to him.
A small boy had caught a small fish on the
wharf and was unable to get his hook out of
thÂ« mouth of the prize. It stuck far down
within the fish's head and no skill on the part
of the small boy could make it break its hold.
Douglas, seeing the lad's predicament, volun
teered to separate the heck and fish. He did
so, but the hook transferred itself to his hand,
where it hung. Even with the boy's assist
ance he could not separate himself from the
sharp barb and the aid of the Harbor Hospital
eurseon was utilized to that end.
As Douelas went out of the hospital care
fully Holding his bandaged hand, ho solilo
quized:
"Well, I am a wicker, but I caught myself."

TO SAIL.
Prospective transbay passengers
sauntering down Market street and
watching that clock found the doors
closed and their boats a mile away.
Every Oaklander on his or her way
home missed the trip by seven and one
half minutes and had to wait for the
next boat. The man from Sausalito
and the Tlburonian watched their re
spective boats steam away to the north/
while the Berkeleyite and citizen of far
Alameda sat out a quarter of an hour
and mingled their tears together. The
waiting rooms were filled with the
comers who came too late because of
the clock that overslept itself.
The big clock on the tower of the
Ferry building sot up 7 minutes and 30
seconds late yesterday morning:.
"Whether it was an oversleep or a run
down the belated travelers, who stood
on the pavement in front of the
building and scolded it to its face, did
not know. 'Whether it tried to catch
up or not only the clock knows, but all
day the th** hours swept around the
other city dials on time, with the ferry
clock keeping seven and one-half min
utes behind. The loss of those frac
tions of the century was farther reach
ing than a mere mechanical slow-down
or a chronological lapse.

FAIR GROUNDS SELECTIONS.
The wind waa exceptionally strong
yesterday and the sailors were com
pelled to shorten sail. The strong:
wind accounts for the comparatively
poor time made. : - /.'
In the second section, which con
tained five boats, the Coronado. Â«wn
ed by McCleary, won after five races
had been held. In the fifth race her
only rival was the Zampa and she waa
beaten by eight seconds.
In the first finals the Apache fin
ished In 4:07 and the Coronado In
4:20. The Apache improved her time
in the second final race, negotiating
the windward course in 3:40. The
Coronado did not finish and the pen
nant, which wasc held by Collier's
Fannie, was awarded to the Apache.
William Comer's new racing rules
were given their first real trial by
model yachtsmen at Spreclcela Lake
yesterday "and proved a great im
provement over the old Â¦ rules. With
only one timer an average of five
races an hour were sailed. The races
were over shortly after 4 o'clock and
the model yacht owners had one of
the most enjoyable days they have
spent at the new lake. It tha new
rules prove as satisfactory on tha
next two Sundays they will undoubt
edly be adopted.
The Apache, owned by William
Roeckner, did some remarkable sail
ing yesterday. She was the whola
show, winning every race in which
she started and making the best time
of the day. In the first section there
were four boats. Only threo trial
races were necessary, as the Apacha
won all of them.

NEW RACING RULES A HELP
TO MINIATURE YACHTSMEN
Only six boats crossed the starting
line and only three finished in the an
nual regatta of the San Francisco
Yacht Club yesterday. ! The start was
across an imaginary line drawn from
the club wharf at Sausalito to the yawl
Tramontana; thence to and round
Goat Island shoal buoy, leaving it on
the starboard hand; thence to and
round the Presidio shoal buoy, leaving
it on the starboard hand; thence to the
finish across the starting: line; the dis
tance being estimated at eleven nauti
cal miles. The starting gun waa fired
from tile club wharf at 11:15 a. m., the
yachts being allowed two minutes
within which to cross the line without
penalty. The sloop Thetis crossed at
11:15:30 a. m., and the sloop Challenger
at 11:15:40 a. m. The sloops Zada, An
nie and Curlew and the little yawl
Witch did not cross the line within the
allotted two minutes, so their time was
taken as 11:17 a. m.
The actual starting time of Curlew
was 11:45, and. of Annie 11:51 a. m.. the
wind falling light. /In the channel a
strong breeze was encountered and the
smaller boats did not complete the
course. , v ' -
The sloop Challenger finished at
1:59:30 p. m., in an elapsed and correct
ed time of 2 hours 43 minutes 50 sec
onds. The sloop Annie finished at 2:07:05
p. m., in an elapsed time of 2 hours 50
minutes 5 seconds, or a corrected time,
after deducting her time allowance of
six minutes, of 2 hours 44 minutes 5
seconds. Challenger took first prize by
the narrow margin of fifteen seconds.
Had Annie. not lost thirty-six minutes
at the start, she would have taken first
place easily. Curlew finished at 4:06:30
p. m., in an elapsed time of 4 hours 49

Oakland made a great start for the
day on its own battle grounds^before
the Fiin had risen high. Peter Loh
jnan led his hosts to the Eighth street
lot as the day wore on and his breast
was filled with hope. But all that
hope took Jlight after ayfew rounds
had been reeled off, for Peter then per
ceived that the Commji^rs did not
have a chance. Scores: game

Mr. Barber again demonstrated to
those present that a change of bosses
vas all that he needed to become a
star who can twinkle some. When he
liad Parke Wilson for an employer,
this young man found the winning of
bill games entirely foreign to his na
ture. But now ifs different. He can
pitch the real kind of stuff every day
in the week and get away with ' all
his games.
He was the big chief yesterday and
Oakland knew it. He would have made
it two shut-outs In a row but for his
own error in round three. The error
did not do a whole lot of harm. After
that time Mr. Barber pave the Com
muters a clean shave and he cut the
hair of six by winging them to the
bench on strikes.
It was not much of a ball game at
that, nor was the crowd such-much
either. Oakland played rotten base
ball when it should have been playing
the real article. Dr. Moskiman was
pood enough to let In two runs by his
miFplays and Schlafley allowed another

Both men advanced when the ball was

The natives were rijrht there with an

Three thousand people assembled at
the Presidio Athletic grounds yester
day afternoon to witness the game of
football between tha Parnells and a
picked team from the McBrides. Em-
I mets and Eagles. The spectators had
i their money's worth of sport and were
given an exhibition of rough-and-tum
ble fighting not counted as part of the
day's performance.
The game was exciting from the start,
but the Parnell men were too strong
in their play, for the Occidentals, as
the picked team was called, and won
the game by a score of 5 to 1.
The first half of the game was stub
bornly played. The Parnells handled
the ball with better judgment than the
Occidentals, but when time was called
each team had one point and the spec
tators were at fever height of enthu
siasm. During the early portion of
ihe game, J. Murphy of the Parnells
received a kick in the right knee which
tent him to the sod and put him out
of the game. His place was filled by P.
McGuire. who made several good plays
before time was called.
WIND IX FAVOR,
The wind was blowing a gale when
the whistli^ announced the call for the
second half. The Parnells had the
wind with them and at once began
their rapid work. As Pat Lynch, the
referee, bunted the ball into the line,
the Parnell men sent it flying down the
field toward their goal, but it had not
gone two yards before the Occidentals
had the sphere " back over the center
and going at a good' clip for their sta
tion.
The crowd along the field line could
not be held back as it crowded up to
see the hot work going on. close to the
Occidental goal. Self-constituted spe
cial officers tried to force the crowd
back and the result was an'Â» exchange
cf blows among the spectators and
those trying to keep â¢ the line clear.
Good nature In the grand stand and
among the more sober spectators on the
edge of the field prevented a' small
sized riot. Order had hardly been re
stored when one of the Occidentals
fouled one of the Parnell men. A rapid
exchange of blows followed, but Referee
Lynch quickly separated the belliger
ents.
Parnell had the ball within fifteen
yards of the goal when Rushton sent
it flying to the left of the field with a
veil directed kick. Pat Scanlon of the
Parnells made a rapid run for the ball,
but was tackled by two Occidentals
and sent spinning through the air.
Scanlon's speed was so great that when
he landed on the sod he dug up the
ground for a distance of six feet with
his left ear.
INJURED MAX GAME.
When assisted to his feet, Scanlon's
car looked like five cents' worth of
dog meat after a puppy had chewed it
for two minutes. Time was called un
til the injured man could be attended.
Two glasses of whisky were applied,
one externally and the other where it
is supposed to do the most good, and in
a few minutes Scanlon was back on
the field with a bloody handkerchief
around his head. The crowd howled
itself hoarse and Pat went In to win.
Several times the Occidentals had the
ball dangerously near the goal but
failed to score. In one of the rapid mix
ups, the bandaged head of Scanlon
cculd be seen bobbing up and down and
h!s right foot suddenly lift and send the
ball over half the length of the field
toward the goal and the last point
scored.
The game was considered a good one
and the winners were challenged by
the Wolfe Tones and the Emeralds. Fol
lowing was the line-up of the two
teams:

the damage will not exceed $500.
which is covered by insurance. The
cause of the lire was a defective flue.
' There was exciting coursing: at Union
Park yesterday owing to the fins fona
of thÂ« dogs and the craftiness and
swiftness of the hares. Two big upsets
sent the short *nd supporters tatÂ©
ecstasies. Frisco Lad at 6 to 1 beatinx
Red Pepper and at the same tempting
odds Idleness wrung tha honors from
Rapid Water.
There were several other short ends. â¢
but the prices were not quite so ex
tended as the above.
Our Motto and Mr. Zlgnego furnished
a dramatic run which served to stir up
the enthusiasm of the admirers of tha
game dogs. For Just four minutes and
a half the hare eluded the combating
thoroughbreds and when It finally
escaped the excitement was at Its
height. The puppies ihowed up well
and many promise to give good ac
counts of themselves in the Futurity
to be run in September.
Rusty Anchor and The Delta proved
themselves game puppies and the de
ciding course In which Rusty Anchor
was favorite was a fairly close con
test, the score being 9 to 7. Charter

nice ease in the deciding course of the

STANDING OF THE CLUBS,
Hereafter Trainer Frank McDonald
will permit . Eddie Hanlon to do no
rough work while his charge is fitting
himself to meet Battling Nelson. In
the past it haa been customary for Ed
die to indulge in mix-ups with his
sparring mates while training that
were often fiercer than many real ring
battles. Hanlon would deal out all the
punishment that he had in stock and
would assimilate all that was sent in.
Often thÂ© little boxer peeped for days
from eyes that were in mourning as a
result of stiff wallops and breathed
through a nose that was puffed and
skinned through coming in violent con
tact rwith mitts wielded by his op
ponents. . But now there is to bo a
change and here la the reason why, as
given by Trainer McDonald:
"Hanlon is a willing worker and has
been in the habit of training for a
fight as hard as if he were engaged
in a genuine ring battle. He has con
sumed unnecessary energy in pursuing
such tactics and taken beatings that
he should not have received. While
I am directing Eddie's training I mean
to # do it in such a manner that he will
conserve all of his vitality and strength
so that he will have it when the cru
cial time comes in the ring. Battling
Nelson Is a powerful and dogged lad
and will probably rough it when he
mixes with Hanlon. That will be
the occasion when Hanlon will have
need for stamina and I mean to have
#Im store up a good supply. I will
use care in selecting his boxing part
ners and will not allow any more
rough-house training."
More than 600 visitors made their
way to Hanlon's quarters at Croll's
Gardens, Alameda, yesterday after
noon. Eddie wrestled with Toby Ir
win, Joe Angeli and Fred Landers,
punched the bag, operated the wrist
machine and boxed shadows for two
hours in all.
Landers and . Angeli went four fast
rounds and Irwin donned the mitts
with Mike Synfy. In the second round
of this bout Toby scored with a stiff
left to Synfy*s Jaw point and Michael
went to oblivion for the count.
Many sports from San Francisco and
San Rafael visited Larkspur yester
day to watch Battling Nelson work for
his coming battle with Eddie Hanlon.
After 3 p. m. standing room was at a
premium and "Smiling" Metzner had
to turn many disappointed sports away.
Nelson punched the bag and did other
gym stunts for nearly forty-five
minutes without resting and showed
no sign of distress. Three rounds each
with Frank Newhouse and Dan Dan
zlger completed the day's work.
The sports who watched Nelson were
immensely pleased with his work and
surprised at the speed he showed. Ted
Murphy is elated with Nelson's condi
tion and thinks he has a fine oppor
tunity to reach the top of his class.
Murphy trained Billy Rothford when
he won the bantam-weight champion
ship from Sammy Kelly, and Eddie
Santry, who bested Ben Jordan for the
feather-weight championship.

A Suey Sing man lost his cue â most 1

Considering that the honors of warfare
were about even, the bloodthirsty Ce

but it was agreed that each tong

lost his cue and him who was shaved

The extra police have been -with

Although this difficulty, has been set

The slight Mongolian unpleasantness |
existing between the Hop Sing and
Suey Sing tongs was amicably settled
yesterday afternoon. A meeting was
called at 1 p. m. by the officials of the

the worst of the quarrel and that it
therefore should treat Its adversary i

OAKLAND. July 17.â Under the post
mortem knife a bullet wound that
could not, in the opinion of the autopsy
surgeons, have been self-inflicted, was
disclosed to-day in the brain of the un
known man whose.; body, buried under
newly cut tree ' branches, was found
yesterday afternoon by.J. W. Chard of
San Francisco, - in a lonely canyon in
the Piedmont hills.
That murder was done is the convic
tion of the surgeons who made the post
mortem examination at the Morgue, To
Dr. O. D. Hamlin, who had charge of
the autopsy, the location of the wound
and the course of the bullet were con
vincing evidence -that the' dead man
did not fire the shot that caused death.
The injury, to the brain .was such that
the victim could not have moved after
he had been shot. Death was instan
taneous, say the surgeons.
The revelations of j the autopsy,
coupled with the futile search by the
officials for a pistol or other firearm
near the place where the body was
found, and the further strange con
cealment of the corpse under its cover
ing of twigs, tend to convince the in
vestigating authorities that the un
identified stranger was killed by an
other than himself. Close examination
discovered a series of scratches extend
ing across the forehead, cheeks and
nose, all running In the same direction.
These looked as if they might have
been inflicted by dragging the body,
face downward, by the legs. Dr. Ham
lin, who studied the scars minutely
declared they could readily have re
sulted from such violence.
The bullet was lodged under the skull
In a line above the left eye. The im
pact had caused a bad splintering of
the skull. ' It ' had entered the head
from the back,- Just below and back of
the right ear. The external â¢ wound
was so small and' so hidden by the
matted hair that it was not discovered
until the surgeon's knife had been
used.
Un'der Sheriff Hanifin was inclined
to the theory of euicide until the report
of the "autopsy surgeons* was made.
The Sheriff's office will further investi
gate the mystery to-morrow. An in
quest" will be held, but not until time
has been given for official inquiry and
possible identification of the remains.
; Though his clothing was shabby, his
shoes badly worn and the general ap
pearance of- the garments that of one
in poverty, the man's countenance in
death was not that of rf tramp. There
was no evidence that he had been
drinking. The internar organs were in
normal condition. The stomach con
tained six ounces of partially digested
foofl, showing that death had occurred
very soon after .he had partaken of a
hearty meal. The external conditions
all indicated that death occurred about
twenty-four hours before the body was
found, and this was borne out by the
surgeon's investigation.
The dead - man's clothing was given
a thorough overhauling to-day#.but not
a mark was found identifying Its dead
owner. On the cheap, white starched
shirt was the tag of "Newman & Klein,
270-272 South Main street, Los Ange
les."
'â¢It occurred to me that . this man
might accidentally have been killed by
some hunter. The hills in that neigh
borhood are traveled over every day
by hunters, and it might be that some
one did shoot the man and then hid his
body under the brush for fear of de
tection. If Chard had not seen the up
turned! uncovered face he would have
overlooked the body, for it was hidden
under .the t,wigs.
ONliY CliEW "TO IDENTITY.
The gulch is off the, new road that
branches into the foothills opposite
Highlands, Isaac \j. Requa's home. It
is three miles from the canyon to the
nearest residence, that of J. B. Rich
ardson, an attorney of 'this city. From
that place Chard telephoned last night
to the Coroner regarding his discov
ery. None of the people in the neigh
borhood could give any information
that would throw light on the case.
Deputy Coroner Quellen said to-day:
Tho hat had no marks on it. Under
the sweatband was a folded bunch of
newspaper advertising copy. . It had
been used for filling to make the hat
lit the wearer's head.
That this victim of . murder .was a
stranger to this neighborhood seems
certain. Not an inquiry was made" to
day at the Coroner's office concerning
him. Deputy Coroner Quellen, in com
pany with Under Sheriff J. J. Hanifin
Jr., made a thorough search to-day' in
the bed of the creek and along, the
sides of the gulch where the body wa3
found. They picked up an empty pis
tol bullet shell and an exploded ' shot
gun cartridge. Through the brush' they
tramped and all else they could get
was an old derby hat, battered . and
bfoken. It was found a few feet from
where Chard stumbled upon the body.
VICTIM A STRANGER,
Dr. Reinle agreed with the opinion
expressed by Dr. Hamlin. Dr. Kane
gave no opinion, as he left before the
autopsy was concluded. .
Other vxterlor murks of vlolpnco- were found
atK>ut the face and tho forehead, and . there
were many small scratches and' linear (.cars
running in the tame direction. These were on
the opposite side of the face from that which
was turned ud when the body was found. The
scars oouKI have been made by dragging the
bo'ly â¢ face downward over the uround. Tho
position of tho body on the ground also lndl
ccted the mr.n could not have *hot himself.
There is no position he. .could stand or lie In
thnt wouM er.able him to Inflict thl3 wound.
If he tried to thoot himself In the back of the
head the bullet would have plowed downward
instead of uiiward.
I haven't the slightest hesitancy in declaring
this case ore of murder. The man .himself
cuuld not have inflicted the wi.umi, which was
instantly fatal. This Is a case when the
weapon v.as h"lcl at h <JWIanc*> of at least
four or 'five feet and fired from behind ' the
victim. If b> any chance he could have
twisted his Â«<rm around into such a position
thnt a pistol tnvzzle could Tiave b;cn placed
at th*- point where this bullet hole was found,
th" weaiMjn btuat ha\e been held so close to
the head that much powder would have been
blown into tbe skin.
to the head, as powder would have
been found lodged in the skin: The
muzzle must have, been several feet
distant from the head when the wea
pon was fired. The bullet was â¢ of
small caliber.
The autopsy was conducted by Dr.
Hamlin. Dr. George J. Reinle and Dr.
J. M. Kane. After the surgeons had
exposed the skull ; they traced the
course of the bullet. It ran in an up
ward and inward direction, plowing
through the brain until it ' flattened
against the skull on the opposite side.
.Concerning thu conditions disclosed
by the autopsy Dr. Hamlin said:

Assistant District Attorney Flood
was notified and he decided to get a
dying statement from Hartman to be
used at the trial of Geber. Detective
Ryan was detailed to .convey the pris
oner to the hospital in order that
Hartman might again identify the man
who killed his brother and also shot
him. Charles Hartman Sr. was at the
bedside of his son when Geber was j
ordered taken to the hospital. As the i
elder Hartman had threatened to Rill j
Geber if he had an opportunity, Po- j
licemen Collins and "Walsh, two of the!
largest men on the force, were detaifed
to accompany Ryan and his prisoner
to the hospital to prevent any demon
stration on the part of Hartman when
he saw the slayer of his sons. Word
was also telephoned to the hospital to
keep Hartman out of the room during
the time Geber remained. That re
quest was complied with by the hos
pital physicians and the elder Hart
man did no.t know Geber had been near
him until the prisoner had been taken
away. '
MAKES XO STATEMENT.
When ' Assistant District Attorney j
Flood asked young Hartman to make i
a dying statement, the man mumbled
that he did not believe he was going to
die, but at the same time indicated
that Geber was the man who had shot
him and killed his brother.
Dr. Plymire opened the wound and
thoroughly cleansed it, but the dreaded
conditions had taken too firm a hold
and death ensued shortly after six
o'clock last night. . Dr. Baclgalupi, the
autopsy surgeon of the morgue, was
present when the operation was per
formed. As the case was in reality a
death by violence, the body was con
veyed to the morgue, where an au
topsy will be performed this morn-
Ing.
When Geber was notified that George
Hartman had died he had nothing to
say. An additional charge of murder
will be placed against Geber this morn
ing. â¢_,
RESUME OF CASE.
! George Hartman, the second victim
of Geber's weapon, was shot in the
arm while holding a door to prevent
, Geber getting into a room at the Hart
man home Sunday morning. July 10.
Geber had been discharged by the elder
Hartman, and he proceeded to annihi
late the entire family. Charles Hart
man was instantly killed and) George
shot in the arm. Geber, who is a Ba- !
varian. also tried to shoot George
Hartman Sr. and knocked Mrs. Hart
man down with the revolver. Before
beiir* captured the murderer tried to
kill Policeman Tyrrill. The poHceman's
j hands were badly cut and he was com
pelled to use his club freely before the
prisoner was subdued. Geber is await
ing trial on a, charge of murdering
1 Charles Hartman, a verdict to that ef
j feet having been rendered by a Coro
i ner's jury.
GUARD THE PRISONER.
George Hartman Jr., the young: man
who was shot in the arm by August
Geber last Sunday morning, when Ge
ber killed Charles Hartman and tried
to annihilate the entire Hartman fam
ily, died last night at 6:05 at the Mc-
Nutt hospital of lockjaw, caused . by
blood poisoning resulting from the
wound inflicted by Geber.
Immediately following the murder of
Charles Hartman on Sunday. July 10,
George Hartman was treated for the
wound in his arm by Dr. D. B. Ply
mire. Since that time the wound was
examined daily and supposed to bÂ«Â«
getting along - nicely. Saturday night
Hartman began complaining of great
pain. ' He had visited the doctor's office
during the afternoon, but at that time
showed no particular symptoms of
blood poisoning. Yesterday morning the
young man's condition became alarm
ing and Dr. Plymire waa summoned
to the family home at 321 Third street.
The doctor found his patient in a seri
ous condition and ordered his removal
to the hospital. Rigidness of the mus
cles was excessive and by the time the
hospital was reached an operation was
decided upon. The police department
was notified of the man's condition and
the fear suggested that the. case might
prove fatal.
The blowing of police whi6tles in the
vicinity of Union Square Park shortly
before 6 o'clock yesterday morning at
tracted the attention of Policemen
Matheson, Orr, "W. Cavanaugh and
Brady. They ran to the scene and
found three Chinese, Ting -Sing, who
lives at 621 Dupont street, and Lou
Yir.g and Quan Luey, who live at 16
Waverly place, who said they had been
held up by two white men.
The Chinese pointed to two men who
were running along Sutter street and
the officers 6tarted in pursuit.
One man was captured and taken to
the city pricon where he was booked on
a charge of assault to commit robbery.
A package of clothing 1 and papers taken
from Ting Sing was booked as evidence
against him. He gave the name of W.
Jenkins and said he was employed run
ning an elevator at the Alnsworth
lodging-house at 109S Post street.
