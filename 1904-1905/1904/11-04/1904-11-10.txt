NOW. that the smoke of battle has cleared away, DemocratsTare already discussing the reorganization of the
party. , In a lengthy statement William Jennings Bryan declares the Democracy was defeated because it
abandoned radical principles and surrendered to Wall street. Now, says the twice defeated candidate for
the Presidency, it must return to the principles advocated'in 1896 and 1900. Hearst and Watson will attempt
to reorganize the party along socialist lines.

A\PS. SHERMAN'S DEPOSITION ALSO READ
The steamship stewardess' siory of the voyage of Miss Do/beer from Cherbourg to New
fork last June was read to the jury in the will contest case yesterday. Her deposition told
of unusual conauct, but it was hardly to be regarded as strong evidence of insanity. She said
Detective Stillwell had sought to have her make statements of much more effective charac
ter, but she refused. The reading of Mrs. Sherman's deposition was also completed.

were employed in removing the wooden
casing from the interior of an irrigation
Â¦well, forty fec-t deep. Mathers was at
the bottom of the well and Rudolph
operated a* windlass at the mouth of
the weiL Mathers had chopped away
a few of the lower timbers of the cas
ing while Rudolph was hauling the
debris up and out of the well. The
â¢topping of the lower timbers lessened
i he strength of the wooden caslnff.^and
suddenly the upper timbers of the cas
ing" broke away. Amid a crashing of
boards and scantlings tons of stones
and earth poured down upon Mathers
from th<^ caving walls.
Rudolph says that his companion was
buried un<^r thirty feet of the cav

pened he at once summoned assistance
and* volunteers are at work ditreinsr to
ward the rescue of Mathers. /
The grief of Mrs. Mathers^and her
four daughters is pitiful to' behold.

Wishing to >uy a little gift for a

into the store soon after the pretty

LOS ANGELES,' Nov. Â».â From the

wealthy man of leisure and great
traveler is the step just taken by a
beautiful young lady of this city. The
news of the marriage which has -just

LONDON, Nov. 9. â The Spanish
embassy here authorizes ten emphatic
denial of the report 'circulated by a
news agency in the United States of
the betrothal of King Alfonso to
Princess Victoria of Connaughu
But in answer to the Questions pro
pounded to her during the taking of
the deposition the stewardess said she
had warmly refused to sign : the state
ment for the reason that part of it was
falseâ that part in which Miss Warren
was said to have made mention of Miss
Dolbeer's mental condition and of Â¦ a
lover. But she had , no objection to tell
ing what she knew of the strange man
ner of Miss Dolbeer while crossing the
ocean.
The" most of the day was spent in
finishing the reading of the deposition
of Mrs. Raymond H. Sherman, a daugh
ter of Mrs. J. L. Moody, a neice of the
contestant and cousin' of the testatrix.
On Monday her statements -were ad
duced to the effect that a "change had
come over Miss. Dolbeer during the last
year of her life," she "had become
very thin," and was "indifferent ' to
anything and everything in life." . ;
Yesterday It transpired that Mrs."
There was some new testimony in
the Dolbeer will contest yesterday â
testimony that had been sealed up in
depositions and withheld from the pub
lic. The contestant shot "one of his
strongest bolts, which was the deposi
tion of the stewardess of the Deutsch
land. on which Miss Bertha Dolbeer
crossed the Atlantic shortly before her
death. The German woman's state
ments were that the passenger "stared"
constantly, bore a "sad expression on
her " face," and Miss Warren, to con
trol her, "spoke as one would to quiet
a child." ; :Â¦ r
Miss "Warren was with Miss Dolbeer
on the voyage in June last. They took
the steamer at Cherbourg, after a stay
in Paris, where Miss Dolbeer had gone
to seek rest. the attorneys for
the contestant laid much stress on
this testimony of Miss Wilhelmina
Pflueger, Pillsbury and McEnerney
smiled at it. The jury had by this
time been overtaxed by deposition
reading and it exhibited no sign of
arousal from languor.
There was a very interesting part of
Miss Pflueger's deposition. that did not
reach the ears of the jurors, for Judge
Coffey would not permit it to be. read.
It appears that C. J. Still well/ for
rcerly a detective in San Francisco but
now in New York, approached her in
the interest of contestant Schander to
ascertain what testimony she might
give. She says he brought with him a
typewritten statement for her to" sign
wherein it was set forth that Misa
Warren had told her while the vessel
was on the ocean that Miss Dolbeer
was insane from melancholia," resulting
from the loss of. her lover.

THE CONTEST TO BREAK MISfc LOLBEER'S WILL, AND SCATTER THB FORTUNE BEQUEATHED BY THE UNFOR

In Nebraska the definite announce
ment . that the Legislature Is Republi
can disposes of the statement that Wil
liam . J. : Bryan ; had . aspirations for .the
United .States Senatorship. In. that
State, too, the, Governorship is in doubt/
There is a curious situation in Min
nesota, where Roosevelt has 125.000
plurality,. but where a-Democratic Gov
ernor. ' and a Republican . Lieutenant
Governor were elected..'
.Chairman Babcock of the Republican
Congressional Campaign Committee
has been ., returned to Congress, but
Chairman Cowherd , of: the r Democratic
Congressional \ Campaign Committee
was, defeated in Missouri. .
- Â¦- The situation i in ; Colorado presented
an interesting phase to-nijrht. Roose
velt : has carried \ the ' State by probably
15,000, but -the i Governorship is still in'
doubt; both sides claiming victory.
The "Solid South" was broken by the
defection of Missouri. The figures to
night show but twelve States, with 133
votes, for Judge Parker. President
Roosevelt carried all the Northern
Statesâ swept them in factâ and to
night he. < has 343 electoral votes. The
banner. State is Pennsylvania. Twenty
four hours after the polls closed the
returns, from this State indicated that
Roosevelt's plurality â¢ would reach 485,
ooo. Â¦:Â¦Â¦>Â¦Â¦< .
Next 'came Illinois, where the Presi
dent polled approximately 225,000 more
votes than; did Parker.
Ohio gave Roosevelt . 200.000 and New
York 174,000. The New York* Citv re
turns are .still .incomplete. - but the
amazement over the . result has not
subsided. Judge Parker carried Great
er'New York by less than 41,000 votes.
| In general, the situation Is chiefly in
teresting :to-night because of 'the fact
thaCthe tickets in many of the) States
were cut. President Roosevelt ran
ahead of his ticket in many localities.
In Massachusetts he had a plurality of
86,000, 'while the Republican candidate
for Governor was defeated by 35,000.
In that State the* Legislature Is Re
publican, and the entire Republican
ticket, with the exception of Governor,
was. elected. In Missouri the circum
stances are similar/.
* . NO TOGA FOR. BRYAN.
NEW; YORK, Nov. 9.â With the
election" returns' still incomplete the
plurality' for President Roosevelt in
the- nation,; according to all indications
to-night, j will exceed I 1,500.000â the
greatest ever given an American can
didate. The nearest approach to this
vote was in 1896,, when McKinley re
ceived a plurality approximating 850,
000, and in 1872, when Grant received
762,'991.
.To-night the -interest centers in
Missouri and Maryland. Late re
turns indicate that the former State
is in the Republican column, so far as
Presidential electors are concerned,
but that Joseph W. Folk, the Demo
cratic candidate, has been elected
Governor.
In'. Maryland the Presidential vote
probably will ; - be cast for Roosevelt.
Late . returns to-night indicate that
Thomas A. Smith has been elected to
Congress by the Democrats in the
First District. Congressman Jackson
of this district to-night,": however, put
forward the claim that trick ballots
were used and says he will contest the
election.
In the other. States it is simply a
question of pluralities. ..

Bryan says he did what he could to prevent the reorganization of the
Democratic party; wiien he failed in this he did what he could to aid
Parker and Davis in order to secure such reformsâ and there were sev
eralâpromised by their election. Now that the campaign is over, he will
assist- those who. desire to put the Democratic party once more on a strong
basis; he will assist. in organizing for the campaign of 190S.
, "It does not matter so much who the nominee may be. During the next
three years circumstances may bring; Into the arena some man especially
fitted to carry the standard.. It will be time enough to nominate a candi
date when ' we are near enough to the campaign to measure the relative
availability of those worthy to be considered. .' *
. .'.'But'/we ought , to', begin now .to- lay our plans " for . the next national
campaign ; and 1 to form .the line of . battle.

Bryan says that for two years he has pointed out the futility of any
attempt to , compromise with wrong or to patch up a peace with the great
corporations which are now exploiting the country, but the sound money
Democrats were bo alarmed by the race Issue that they listened rather re
luctantly, be it salfl to their credit, to the promises of a successful cam
paign held out by those who had contributed "to the defeat of the party in
the two preceding campaigns. He continued:
. "The experiment has been a costly one and it is not likely to be re
peated during the present generation. The Eastern Democrats were also
deceived. They were led to believe that the magnates and monopolists who
coerced the voters in 1896 and supplied an enormous campaign fund in both
1S96 and 1900 would help the Democratic party If our party would only be
less radical. . The corporation press aided in this deception and even the Re
publican papers professed an unselfish desire to help build up the Demo
cratic party. The election has opened the eyes of the hundreds of thou
sands of honest and. well meaning Democrats who, a few months ago, fav
ored the reorganization of the party. These men now see that they must
either, go into the Republican party or join with the Democrats of the West
and South in making the Democratic party a positive, aggressive and pro
gressive reform organization. There is no middle ground."
Will Jlssist in Reorganization.
"The Democratic party cannot hope to compete successfully with the
Republican party for this support. To win the support of the plutocratic
element of the country the party would have to become more plutocratic
than the Republican party.. and it could not do this without losing several
times as many votes as that course would win. The, Democratic party has
nothing to gain by catering to organized and predatory wealth. It must not
only do without such support. 'but it can strengthen itself by Inviting the
open'and emphatic opposition of these elements. The campaign Just closed
shows that It is as inexpedient from the standpoint of Â» policy as it
Is wrong from the standpoint of principle K to attempt any con
ciliation of the Industrial and financial despots who are ' gradu
ally ' getting control of. all the avenues of wealth. The Democratic
party.' if It hopes to win success, must take the side of the plain common
people."
Futility of Making Compromises.
"In 1S96 the line was drawn for the first time during the present genera
tion between plutocracy and democracy, and the party's stand on the side
of democracy alienated a large number of plutocratic Democrats, who in
the nature of things cannot be expected to return, and it drew to itself a
large number of earnest advocates of reform, whose attachment to these re
forms Is much stronger than attachment to any party name. The Republi
can party occupies the conservative position. This Is, it defends those who.
having secured unfair advantage through class legislation, insist that they
shall not be disturbed, no matter how oppressive their exactions may be
come.
-Â¦--Â¦â¢ "The convention "accepted this theory and the platform made no refer
ence to the money -question^ but Judge Parker felt that it was his duty to
announce his personal adherence tV the sold standard. His gold telegram,
as it was called, while embarrassing to 1 the Democrats of the " West and
South, :'warf applauded by the Eastern press. He had the cordial Indorse
ment of, Mr." Cleveland, Who declared that the party had returned to "safety
and sanity"; he had "the support of the Democratic papers which bolted In
1S96, arid he also had the aid of nearly all of those who were prominent in
the campaigns of 1896 and 1900, and yet his defeat Is apparently greater than
the party suffered in either of those years.
"It is unquestionable also that Judge Parker's defeat was not local but
general, the returns from the eastern States being as disappointing as the
returns from' the West. The reorsranizers are in complete control of the
party. They planned the campaign and carried it on according to their own
views, and the f verdict against their plan is unanimous. Surely silver can
not be blamed for this defeat, for the campaign was run on a gold basis.
Neither can the defeat be charsred to emphatic condemnation of the trusts,
for the trusts were not assailed as vigorously this year as they were four
years ago. It is evident that the campaign did not turn upon the question
of imperialism, and It is not fair to consider the result as a personal victory
for the President, for his administration was the subject of criticism. The
result was due to the fact that the Democratic party attempted to be con
servative in the presence of conditions which demand radical remedies. It
sounded a partial retreat when it should have ordered a charge all along
the line.
Plutocratic Democrats Jilienated.
'"The Democratic party hasunet with an overwhelming defeat In the na
tional election. As yet the returns are not sufficiently complete to permit
analysis and it is impossible to say whether the result is due to an actual
increase m Jhe number of Republican voters, t>r to a falling off in the Dem
ocratic vote. This phase of the subject will be dealt with next week when
the returns are all in. The questions for consideration at this time are:
What lesson does the election teach? "arid what of the future? The defeat
of Judge Parker should^not be considered a personal one. He did as well as
he could under the circumstances; he was the victim of unfavorable condi
tions and of a mistaken party policy. He grew In popularity as the cam
paign proceeded and expressed himself more and more strongly upon the
trust question, but could not overcome the heavy odds against him.
"The so-called conservative Democrats charged the defeats of 1S06 and
1900 to the party's position on the money question and insisted that a vic
tory could be, gained by dropping the coinage question entirely.

cal action, but would let his statement serve to explain his position. He

Sherman had not been so intimate' with
Miss Dolbeer as were the other mem
bers of her family, and deponent made
It plain that she had always regarded
Miss Warren as a nurse and maid and
had therefore "taken no interest in
her." "never felt it necessary to recog
nize her" in all the years that Miss
Warren acd Miss Dolbeer were to
gether.
Mrs. Sherman had given many
sharp answers in her deposition, indi
cating that she was excited. Those
who attended the proceedings say that
at one Juncture she stamped her feet
with anger when provoked during the
cross-examination by Attorney Pills
bury.
Deponent said that she knew Miss
Dolbeer and Miss Warren frequently
had disagreements and said she wit
nessed one at the Coronado Hotel at
Han Diego.
RELATIONS NOT INTIMATE.
Mrs. Sherman admitted that her sis
ters - were more intimate with Miss
Dolbeer, for they were nearer of an
eg*. It was also true, she answered,
that she never spoke to John Dolbeer,
Bertha's father, because of the family
estrangement. She had even passed
him on the street without noticing
him. so strong was the feeling over
the quarrel between her mother, Mrs.
Moody, and John Dolbeer, though
they were brother and sister.
"X had called on Miss Dolbeer a
number of times." Mrs. Sherman's
deposition proceeded, "she having be
irun to visit our home after the death
of her father, but when I was about
to leave the last time she made no
reply when I said I was coming again.
I regarded this as a hostile attitude
and understood It was due to Miss
Warren's Influence.
"I never spoke to Miss Warren. The
only time I conversed with her was
over the telephone and that only when
absolutely necessary. I never recog
nlied Miss Warren, and when I met
her and Miss Dolbeer on the street
aiira Warren would always walk
ahead. I had no interest in her. She
went to the Dolbeer home as a nursery
governess, and of course I would not
make her a companion. I did not
recognize Miss Warren as the equal
of Miss Dolbeer, and not having any
thing in common with her it was not
at all necessary to recognize her.
"I do " not remember ever having
seen Adolph Schander at my moth
er's home in fifteen years, although he

"I have no special interest in this

talked about it. for I thought the will
was very unjust."
This ended the deposition of Mrs.
Sherman, and the contestant then took
up that of Wilhelmina Pflueger, the
stewardess who attended Miss Dolbeer
and Miss Warren during the voyage
on the Deutschland. Her home Is in
Hamburg, but the deposition was tak
en in New York.
She testified that she saw Miss Dol
beer and Miss Warren every day in
their cabin and about the deck. She
first noticed them when they entered
their stateroom at Cherboug The
next morning Miss Dolbeer rang the
bell and the stewardess found Miss
Warren dressed and lying on a lounge
while Miss Dolbeer had not yet arisen*
They ordered breakfast, and it was
served by the deponent.

STEWARDESS TELLS OF OOLBEER VOYAGE
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.â That the Dem
ocrats, plunged in defeat, are thinking
seriously of the future of their national
organization was shown to-day by the
wide discussion of the "reorganizing"
of the party and of the policies to be
pursued in the Immediate future. It is
becoming clear that if the "safe and
sane" element pf the party is to remain
in control it must fight to maintain its
ascendency. No one doubts that Wil
liam J. Bryan Intends to make a very
strong effort to take the National Com
mittee and the organization in the va
rious States from Judge Parker. None
very seriously doubts that he will have
the support of Thomas Taggart, chair
man of the National Committee, who
was elected against Judge Parker's
wishes, and in whose selection Judge
Parker acquiesced because there was
nothing else fo do, nor does any one
doubt that Hearst has himself begun a
campaign for the Presidential nomina
tion in 1908 and that he has made some
headway in the way of strengthening
himself in the National Committee.
Hearst and Thomas E. Watson, the
late Populist candidate for President,
it is understood, will be found working
together. It is not clear that Bryan
and Hearst can work together, because
their ambitions clash when the question
of nomination is considered. Bryan de
nied at Lincoln yesterday that he in
tended coming to New York soon to
confer with Hearst and Watson vn the
subject of the reorganization of the
Democratic party. .There ig little doubt
that Bryan is coming on business 'con-;
neeted with the control of the party,'
the only question being whether he is
coming especially to confer with
Hearst. Hearst also had a statement
to make regarding this report. He said:
"I have no knowledge of any meeting
between Mr. Watson, Mr. Bryan and
myself. I think the Democratic party
will reorganize itself on a basis of true
democracy, eliminating the Wall street
influence that proved so disastrous in
this campaign, and I, as a loyal Demo
crat, will be very happy to see that
done. I am always ready to contribute
my own services, and those of my pa
pers, to the Democracy for the reorgani
zation or for any other purpose, if they
shall be required.
"I will be glad to work with all loyal
Democrats for the success of Demo
cratic principles, but I think these
loyal Democrats are quite capable of
choosing their own leaders, and I
imagine this point will now be con
ceded by those who endeavored to
force leaders upon them."
The substance of interviews obtained
from prominent Democrats by The Call
as to the future policy of the party
varies widely. Some, like Hearst,
notably J. G. Johnson of Kansas, a
Bryan follower, belieW the party must
be reorganized on radical lines, with
Wall street influences eliminated.
Others, like Bourke Cockran and Tim
othy D. Sullivan, hold that the party
should wait, should' choose no new lead
ers now, but take advantage of the
mistakes the Republicans will make.
Judge William Lindsay of Kentucky
aaid the party would have done better
to make the tariff more prominent,
and Edward M. Shephard thinks the
old party issues must be maintained.
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.â Representative
W. Bourke Cockran said to-night:
"The Democratic party has not been
left in a constructive position. It has
been linked to death. The affairs of the
country have been placed in the hands
of the Republicans, and we must wait
and see what they are going to do.' If
their policy opens the way to criticism;
we must ' make our plans accordingly
and the people will turn to us to in
quire what we propose. Until that
time comes any man who talks does so
from motives of personal' ambition and
his opinion is worthless."
William Lindsay, formerly United
States Senator from Kentucky, said:
"It is not necessary to go far for an
explanation of the result where the
vote for Parker was less than that
given to Bryan, and for Roosevelt more
than to McKinley. We know that
many who voted for MeKinley voted
yesterday for Parker, and it seems evi
dent that where Parker had one Mc-
Kinley vote, Roosevelt had two Bryan
votes. I expected Roosevelt's election,
but I did not foresee what has hap
pened. 'Now, I suppose, Bryan, and
Hearst will take hold of the party
and attempt to reorganize it. ( Hearst
editorially . declares that the Demo
cratic party must have a Democratic
platform and Democratic nominees.
We have not heard from Bryan yet,
but it is fair to assume that when he
is ready to speak he will say he did
all in his power to assist the Parkar
ticket.
Â¦ "What he said at the outset was
enough to forestall any : , efforts that he
â¢might -make afterward* rand -in his
speeches he did not take back anything
that he had said earlier. It is doubt
ful, anyhow, whether he could have
turned over his entire vote. He. as
leader, had to retain his â¢ party regu
larity. Do you imagine that the con
stituents of the two hundred delegates
sent to the St. Louis convention to
work for Hearst voted for Parker?. I
do not think they did."
Joseph G. Johnson of Kansas, a Bry
an leader at Democratic headquarters,
said:
"I felt certain of Parker's defeat be
fore election. The Democratic party
has departed from its own Ideas of
Jeffersonlan Democracy and before It
wins it has got to get back to first
principles. I feel confident that Wil
liam Jennings Bryan will be the can
didate in 1908, on a platform more radi
cal than that of 1896 or 1900."
John DeWitt Warner said:
"The result Is Just what might have
been expected from the tactics pur
sued by the Democrats. The campaign
committee selected was not only unde
serving the confidence of the party, but
an insult to - its intelligence and good
faith. That committee proceeded on the
assumption that success was to be
gained by obtaining trust support or,
at least, dividing it with the Repub
licans: They started the campaign by
suppressing the trust and tariff issues
and attempting to curry favor with the
very interests most opposed to Democ
racy. These tactics failed, the Repub
lican organization receiving the full
trust support.
"In the last few weeks of the cam
paign, an attempt was made to attack
the trusts and press the tariff issue,
but It was too late. In the first place,
the confidence of ,the ' Democratic
voters had been too thoroughly lost to
be regained. In the next place, the
position of Judge Parker made It Im
possible to consistently attack trust
methods and left practically only a
denunciation of the fact that they had
chosen to subsidise ths Republican vot
ers. This seemed to the people to be
merely resentment that the. trusts had
contributed to the Republican instead
of the Democratic campaign fund. The
result was that the cause of Democ
racy fell between two stools. What Is
the duty of the party? Stop time serv
ing; find out what Democratic prin
ciples, are and take the aggressive."
Frederick W. Henrichs said:
"In my opinion the party must take
-a more radical stand on some of the
great , questions advocated by Bryan,
such as Government ownership of the
railroads and municipal ownership of
public utilities. 11 .
SUTTER CREEK, Nov. 9.â This
town and Amarior City are excited to
night over the result of the Coroner's
inquest on the death of Mrs. Dr.
Staples. The result of the chemical
analysis shows that arsenic was in
the stomach and the Coroner's Jury
therefore gave a verdict of death pro
duced by arsenic administered by un
known persons.
Sheriff Norman of this county has
telegraphed instructions to arrest
Staples and Mrs. Hoxie, both of whom
are missing.
It will be remembered that after the
body of the woman was exhumed the
stomach and bowels were sent to San
Francisco for a chemical analysis.
There was considerable delay In get
ting the results, but they came at last,
and the Coroner proceeded with the
Inquest with the foregoing verdict.
It is now known that for some time
past a San Francisco detective has
been in the wake of Dr. Staples and
Mrs. Hoxie. The couple are alleged
to have been comfortably quartered in
the 1100 block on Market street, and
the doctor, it is said, had introduced
Mrs. Hoxie as his wife. For some time
detectives occupied a room adjoining
to that occupied by the happy couple
and conversed with them freely.
When Dr. Staples read of the ac
count in the newspapers of the body
of Mrs. Staples beln^. exhumed he
made a quick departure and Mrs.
Hoxie â¢iisappeared the same time.
Nothing is known at the present as to
the whereabouts of either.
Photographs of both are now In the
hands of the officers, and it is believed
they will soon be captured.
REPORT OF ARMISTICE.
TOKIO. Nov. 10.â It is reported that
General Stoessel. commanding the be
sieged forces at Port Arthur, has asked
the Japanese for an armistice, the Dur
pose of which is not stated. A con
firmation of the report is unobtainable.
It is hoped here that General Stoessel
will capitulate before the city proper
is taken. The Japanese soldiers are
angry and inflamed on account of the
alleged abuse of the wounded by the
Russians. They believe they will be
murdered if captured. Under these con
ditions It will possibly be difficult to
avoid a massacre when the troops meet
in the final combat.
Stoessel Said to Have Made Overtures
:,-. Â¦.; , to the Japanese.
Policeman Charles T. Russell was
found guilty of disobedience of orders
and fined $5.
P. W. Gorman, who conducts an em
ployment agency at 612 Merchant
street, sent twelve men to Aberdeen,
Washington, last month to work as
mill hands. The men each paid Gor
man $S 50, which included employment
fee and steamer fare. The men re
ported at the mill but were not given
employment. On their return here they
demanded return of their $S 50. Gor
man was willing to return the $2 for
employment fees, but refused to- pay
the rest of the money. The commis
sioners advised Gorman to settle the
matter with the steamship people, as
they were partly responsible.
Michael O'Rourke, charged with
making an illegal arrest, was declared
not guilty. .
Policeman Edward J. Plume, charged
with neglect of duty, was found guilty
and reprimanded by the board.
S. Gianelles and P. Karides. proprie
tors of a restaurant at 833 Howard
street, were deprived of the right to
sell Uquor. Policeman Hendricks re
ported that he had seen a poker game
conducted in the restaurant and drinks
were served without meals.
The Police Commissioners at their
meeting last night postponed the case
of William Pratt, the saloon man, 138
Mason street, until the next meeting
of the â¢ board, when an additional
charge will be investigated.
Policemen Burd and Smith, who had
been detailed to make an investigation
of the saloon, reported that W. W.
Stewart, living at 140 Mason street,
said that he had been beaten with a
blackjack by Pratt and "done up" in
such a way that he was confined to his
bed for several days.
Stewart told the policemen that a
weman friend of his was in the saloon
at 2 o'clock on the morning of Octo
ber 31. He said he was living In the
Essex, a hotel above the saloon, and
he sent word down to have the woman
come upstairs. Pratt sent word back
that the woman could not come up. as
she was going to sing. Stewart alleges
that he went downstairs and tried to
get the woman out of the saloon.
Â¦ He got into a fight with Pratt and
did not know what happened there
after, as he was knocked unconscious.
He said that witnesses to the fight
told him that Pratt used a blackjack
and kicked him when he was down.
Stewart was intoxicated when he was
beaten and thought that he was partly
responsible for the trouble and there
fore he would not bring charges
against Pratt.

a saloon at 425 Pacific street, conduct
ed by Mrs. Arthur Coulter, and while
the proprietor was dozing on a lounge
he proceeded to rob her room. Bro
phy was detected by the barkeeper in
the act of rifling Mrs. Coulter's trunk
and was turned over to Detective Me-
Grayan. When searched at the police
station two of the woman's diamond
rings were found in Brophy's pockets
and he was booked on a charge of
grand larceny.

The Call, to ascertain the strength
of the respective candidates, Interro
gated various members of the Legis
lature in New York and Kings County
as to their preference. It was dis
closed that Kings County would be al
most solidly in favor of re-election of
Depew and that New York County
would vote for Depew if it were agree
able to Governor Odell. On the other
hand. If Governor Odell desired the
nomination himself or decided to sup
port Black for the Senatorshlp, there
is little doubt that New York County
members, with practical unanimity,
would do Just as the Governor wished.
The Call was Informed to-day by
two very prominent politicians, one an
official of the State committee who is
in the confidence of Senator Platt, and
the other a well-known membeV of
Congress from the interior of the
State, in the confidence of Governor
Odell, that an adjustment had been
made of the differences between De
pew And Black and that Depew would
return to the Senate unchallenged, it
was stated that Governor Odell had
said there would be no opposition to
Depew.
NEW YORJv, Nov. 9.â "Has Frank
S. Black abandoned his ambition to
be elected United States Senator to

erally in Republican circles to-day. It
was agreed that if Black had not
abandoned his intention the liveliest
sort of a fight would occur between
himself and Depew at Albany in Janu
ary â one backed by Governor Odell,
the other by Senator Platt.

CHICAGO, Nov. 9.â The sentiment
which swept the Republican candidates

the Republicans have elected 233 Rep
resentatives and the Democrats 14L the
12 remaining districts yet to be heard

Secretary Taft is regarded as the
man with the brightest chance, but his
disposition is more toward a judicial

would greatly prefer a place on the
The President has long held positive
convictions on the third-term question.
When Judge Parker, In his speech of
acceptance, declared he would not take
a second term if elected, the President
privately admitted that he was opposed
to a third term for himself, as well as
for any one else. He declined at that
time to declare himself out of the race
in 1908. This he did because he feared
that a declaration would be taken as
an effort to make political capital in
the campaign. He thought over the
form of his statement and gave it out
as soon as the returns showed a Re
publican victory.
This announcement throws the field
wide open to all ambitious, willing and
reluctant candidates. ,If the President
had not eliminated himself last night
there would soon have been indirect
pressure brought by the various candi
dates for Presidential honors in 1908.
That was the case after President Me-
Kinley was elected in 1900. His con
victions were well known, but Senator
Fairbanks and other ambitious men de
sired a formal declaration.
Immediately after the Philadelphia
convention in X900 Senator Fairbanks
began to plan for the nomination in
1904; Leslie M. Shaw, then Governor of
Iowa, began putting up a modest light
ning rod, and the Roosevelt supporters
would soon have been in the line, when
President McKinley was assassinated.
This changed the entire political as
pect. Everybody conceded that Roose
velt would be his own successor until
his opposition to the trusts caused talk
of Senator Hanna.
The following men ( are considered
available for the nomination In 1908:
Elihu Root of New York. William H.
Taf t of Ohio, Leslie M. Shaw of Iowa,
Senator Fairbanks, Senator' Knox and
Senator. Beveridge of Indiana.
Within the past few weeks it has be
come known here that Senator Bever
idge covets the Republican nomination.
That President Roosevelt should so
soon declare himself out is not consid
ered favorable to Senator Beveridge.
It is improbable that a Beveridge boom
will be formally launched much before
1908.

NEW YORK'S TESTIMONIAL.
In the Legislature, Chairman Connor
of the La Follette State Central Com
mittee claims, there will be eighty
members pledged to carry out fhe
measures advocated by Governor La
Follette. Of this number sixty-three
are Assemblymen and seventeen 1 Sena
tors, or a majority of each house. Chair
man Golden of the Stalwart faction
claims that the Stalwarts and Demo
crats combined will control a majority
of each house, and he predicts that if
Senator Quarles is not re-elected the
Legislature probably will find Itself In
a deadlock.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Nov. 9.â The
result of the election In Wisconsin
shows that Roosevelt ran ahead of
every expectation and carried the State
by a plurality estimated at between
60,000 and 75,000; that Governor La Fol
lette has been re-elected by a plurality
of about 50,000 and that the Congres
sional complexion remains unchanged
from two years ago. The Legislature,
which is to elect a United States Sena
tor to succeed J. V. Quarles, is largely
Republican,, and. the question of
whether Wisconsin shall have a pri
mary election law has carried by a safe
majority.
One of the surprises in the election
was the big increase in the vote of the
Social-Democratic party. Four years
ago that party polled 4453 votes in Mil
waukee; two years ago, 10,704, and in
this election, 1S".12O. The Social-Demo

tire State ticket, an almost entire Re
publican Legislature and the election
of the Salt Lake County ticket. The
latter claim Is disputed by both Dem
ocrats and American party men. The
voting strength of the latter party Is
problematical as yet and will not be
known until the count is finished in
this city. It may be a week before
accurate figures on the State vote are
available.
Chairman Evans of the Democratic
State Committee concedes the election
of eight Republican Congressmen in
Missouri. They are:* Frank D. Klelp
per in the Third District. Frank B. Ful
kerson in the Fourth, Edgar C. Ellis
in the Fifth. John Welborn in the
Seventh, Richard Bartholdt In the
Tenth, Marcus Rhodes in the Thir
teenth, William T. Tyndal In the
Fourteenth and Casslus M. Shartel in
the Fifteenth.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 9.â Roosevelt has
carried Missouri by 10,000 to 15,000. The
â¢only Democrat elected is Folk for Gov
ernor, who made a great race against
the Roosevelt- landslide. His plurality
will be about 25,000. The Legislature is
doubtful, with chances favoring a Re
publican body to elect Senator Cock
rell's successor. Republican Congress
men have been elected In the Third,
Fourth, Sixth. Tenth and Fifteenth
districts.
"Among these may be mentioned the postal telegraph system, state
ownership of railroads, the election of Federal Judges for fixed terms' and
the election of postmasters by the people for their respective communities.
Instead of having the Government controlled by corporations, through offi
cers chosen by corporations, we must have a Government of the people by
the people and for the people; a Government administered by the Jefferson
ian maxim of equal rights to all and special privileges to none.
"Hope and duty point the way. To doubt the success of our cause is to
doubt the triumph of the right, for ours is, and must be, the cause of the
masses. With malice toward none and charity for all, let us begin the cam
paign of 190S; let us appeal to the moral sentiment of the country and ar
raign the policies of the Republican party before the bar of the public con
science."
It .takes time to direct attention to an evil and still more time to con
solidate sentiment In favor of a remedy, and Bryan Is not sanguine enough
to believe that all the reforms that he favors will at once be indorsed by
any party platform, but he will proceed to point out the reforms which he
believes to be needed. He says:
"The Democratic party must make Its attack upon the trusts so ve
hement that no one will suspect it of secret aid from them. It will be to
its advantage If it will begin the next campaign with an announcement
that no trust contributions will be accepted and then prove its sincerity by
pivir.g the public access to its contribution list. In public enterprises the
names of contributors are generally made public, in order to denote the
character and purpose of the work.
"Roosevelt has fc-ur years in which to make good his declaration that
no obligators were Incurred by the acceptance of trust funds. He will
disappoint either the contributors or the voters. If he disappoints the con
tributors the trust question may be put in the process of settlement. If he
disappoints the people they will have a chance to settle with his party four
years hencp. 'Death to every private monopoly* must be the slogan of the
party on this question: any other position Is a surrender. The platforms
of 1900 and 1904 declare that a private monopoly Is indefensible and intol
erable, and this declaration presents the issue upon the trust question.
Â¦ The party must continue its defense of the interests of the wage-
CEincrs: it must protect them from the encroachments of the capitalist. The
fact that lalxrring men have not always shown their appreciation of the
party's position ought not to deter the party from doing its duty in re
gard to them. The labor question is not one that concerns employers and
employes alone: It concerns the entire community, and the people at large
have an interest in the Just settlement of labor controversies. For that
reason they must insist upon remedial legislation in regard to the
hvuiB and arbitration, and they must so limit the authority of the courts
in contempt cases as to overthrow what is known as government by in
junction.
"The party must continue Its opposition to national banks of issue and
must insist upon divorcing the Treasury Department from Wall street.
"The party must continue its fight for the popular election of Senators
and for direct legislation wherever the principle can be applied. It must
not only maintain its position on old issues, but it must advance to the
consideration of new questions as they arise."
Few Reforms at a Time.
"The trust question presents the most acute phase of the contest be
tween Democracy and plutocracy, so far as economic issues are concerned.
The President virtually admits that the trusts contributed to his campaign
fund, l>ut he denies that they received any promises of aid or immunity.
Xo well informed : person doubts that the large corporations have furnished
the Republican campaign fund during the campaign of 1896 and 1900 and
l?04. and no one can answer the logic of Judge Parker's arraignment of
trust contributions. The trusts are run. on a business principle. They do
not subscribe millions of dollars to a campaign unless they are paying for
favors already granted, or purchased favors for future delivery. The weak
ness of Judge Parker's position was that the charge was made at the close
of the campaign, when It was neutralized by a counter charge. The trusts
cannot be fought successfully by any party that depends upon trust funds
to win the election.
Vehement Jfttack on Trusts.
"The party must also maintain Its position on the tariff question. No
answer has been made to the Indictment against the high tariff, and yet,
there, too, the burden of the tariff system is concealed by the method In
which the taxes are collected. It cannot be made the^ole Issue In a cam
paign. The party must renew its demand for an income tax, to be se
cured througrh a constitutional amendment. In order that wealth may be
made to pay its share of the expense of the Government. To-day we are
collecting rractically all our Federal revenues from taxes upon consumption,
and these bear heaviest UDon the poor and light upon the rich.
"The party must maintain its position In favor of bimetallism. It can
not surrender its demand for the use of Its gold and silver as the standard
money of the country, but the question must remain In abeyance until
conditions so change as to bring the public again face to face with falling
prices and a rising dollar. This, therefore, cannot be made the controlling
issue of the contest upon which we are entering.
larpe navy, and to stand for the Independence of the Philippines, for im
perialism is a menace, and against militarism, against the corrupting Influ
ence of commercialism; and yet experience has shown that, however
righteous the party's position on this subject, the Issue does not arouse
the people as they can be aroused by a Question which touches them im
mediately and individually. The injustice done to the Filipino is not re
ceived as It should be, or as we resent a wrong to ourselves, and the
costliness of Imperialism is hidden by the statistics and by our Indirect
system of taxation. While the party must maintain Its position on this
subject. It cannot present thla as the only Issue.
Must Oppose a High Tariff.

Many Democrats who supported
the platform and candidate in 1900
and 1896 purposely remained away
from the polls this year or voted for
Roosevelt, just as Belmont and his
coterie of statesmen voted for McKin
ley in 1S96. It might be said, toolThat
tnere was no particular issue between

BERLIN, Nov. 9. â Government
circles regard Roosevelt's election with
satisfaction, as It means a continuance
of the United States' present policy
tcward Germany. The jelaUons be
tween the President and Emperor Wil

pleasant quality than ever before as
indicated by the rather Sequent per
sonal messages sent through their re
spective Embassadors. Some of the
newspapers consider that the election
will increase the friendliness between
the two Governments and mention the
fact that President Roosevelt s sug
gestion of an arbitration treatj with
Germany is ready for acceptance as an
example of the present good feeling.
Roosevelt's Forcljm Policy Is Satisfac

were received by mail and by tele

most every city In the country. Thou
sands of telegrams already have .been
received and they are coming yet in
an undlminlshed flood. It will prac
tically be impossible for the President
and Secretary Loeb to acknowledge
each message in accordance with the
usual custom at the White House, but
President Roosevelt desires It to be
understood that he appreciates to the
fullest the expression of his friends
and would be glad if it were possible
for him personally to greet and thank
every one of them. â¢
The President was in exuberant
spirits to-day. Although he did not
retire until a late hour last night, he
rose early to-day and had a happy
early morning chat with the members
of his family and bis house guests.
After glancing over the morning pa
pers, he read a few. of the thousands
of telegrams of congratulation which
had been received, and examined bulle
tins of the latest returns from the elec
tion. " .
Secretary of War Taf t was one of the
first callers. The President gave him a
cordial greeting and for a considerable
time they talked animatedly about the
situation. # .- -
Other callers on the President includ

Secretary of State Loomls, Senator
Proctor of Vermont; General John C.

"I am not surprised that this State has gone even beyond the fondest estimates
in the indorsement of President Theodore Roosevelt and the policies of the Republican
party. What else could it consistently do? The' people of California have' simply shown their
hard common sense in yesterday's vote. To have voted against the policy of protection would
have invited disaster to our most cherished interests. On this issue there was but one thing to

These headquarters were in charge
of George C. x Edwards, assistant secre
tary, and under his direction the cards
of the various legislative nominees of
the party were distributed without cost
to them. A smoker every Thursday
evening brought the candidates and
their friends together at the headquar
ters and furnished the needed' relaxa
tion trom the strcnuoushess of the
campaign that now is history. } f Â¦Â¦-.-
The headquarters at 16 Geary street
were decorated inside and out and at
tracted attention from passers by, and
the seven large rooms were visited
daily by a large number of party men
seeking information. Large display
signs were made and displayed from
the flag poles extending over the side
walk of the two Congressional candi
dates, Kahn and Hayes, forming an
additional headquarters for these two
nominees. r -
should not again prevail we hired no
halls nor did we send out speakers un
less the money was in sight. The re
sult is that we retire with a clean rec
ord, and no man can say we did not
pay our bills. This brings us a feeling
of satisfaction, even though our defeat
was complete."
- Owing to the fact that them were no
city or county contests save the Su
perior Judges, there was no definite
work for the Republican County Com
mittee and no funds available for
work. The only thing to do was to
watch out for the general success. The
candidates were encouraged to make
the rooms their headquarters, wherein
they could keep their supplies and meet
their friends and workers. Over 5000
pieces of literature containing the full
ticket were arranged and sent into the
eighteen districts, so that the voters;
while reading good matter, were at all
times in touch with the candidates to
be voted foT.

On the face of nearly complete re
turns Adams (D.) has carried Denver
County by 4500 plurality and" he ap
pears to have afeafe lead over Peabody
outside of this county. According to
the Times. Adams' plurality in the
State will reach over 10,000. The
Times concedes that the result is .in
doubt as to the other State officers,
but .claims the Legislature will be
Democratic in both branches. The
Pest says: j
"Late returns this afternoon indi
cate clearly that the Republican ticket
in Colorado, national. State and* coun
ty, " has been elected by pluralities
ranging from 2000 to 10,000. A con
servative estimate places Governor
Peabddy's plurality, af 5000. He will
carry Denver by from 1500 to 2000."
DENVER, Colo., Nov. 9. â Roose
velt's plurality lfÂ« Colorado has been
increased by later returns and . may
run above 15,000. Republicans and
Democrats claim. the election of Gov

Republicans threaten to contest the
State election on the ground of al
leged frauds in Denver.

The/completion of the count in San
Francisco shows that so far as the city
is concerned the amendment to estab
lish the appellate courts was' given an
overwhelming majority, but the count
throughout the State has yet to be re
capitulated. The completion of the
count here also substantiated the fig
ures given out late- Tuesday night
which established the election of the
entire legislative ticket of the city. In
every district the Republicans won l>y
majorities that leave the most disgrun
tled Democrat of them all without the
slightest ground for contest.
The principal arguments are that
they have had large experience and
that they are In actual touch with
much of the business of the Supreme
Court. There will be three branches of
the court, one each at San Francisco,
Los Angeles and Sacramento. The
bench of the new tribunal must have
not more than six members of one po
litical party. This will give Governor
Pardee a chance to appoint three Dem
ocrats and six Republicans.
As the full bench will have nine
Judges, the five Supreme Court Com
missioners are candidates for a major
ity of the seats. The Commissioners are
N. P. Chipman, Wheaton Gray, J. A.
Cooper. D. H. Smith and R. G. Harri
son. The last named was on the Su
preme bench of California twelve years.
N. P. Chipman has the longest term to
his credit as Supreme Court Commis
sioner. In addition to the Supreme
Court Commissioners there is a host of
other candidates. "
The lawyers are eagerly watching
the returns relating to the constitu
tional amendment to establish an ap
pellate court with nine Judges. The
Governor has the appointment of the
nine Judges for the first term of . two
years. After that the Judges are to be
elected for a term of twelve years by
popular vote. The amendment provides
that the Commissioners of the Supreme
Court shall go out of office In May
next. There are five of the Commis
sioners. They are all candidates, ac
cording to reports, for judgeships in
the appellate court. Governor Pardee
has been requested to consider their
claims and arguments have been made
in their behalf.
Twenty-one thousand eight hundred
and thirty-three is the Republican plu
rality in San Francisco, and the great
county of the State has reclaimed from
Los Angeles the silken banner of the
faith. The total vote cast in the city
Tuesday, according to the semi-official
figures now in the hands of the Regis
trar, was 66,739.
William S. Wood, leader on the Re
publican electoral ticket, polled 39,814
votes, against 17.&S1 cast for John Gar
ber, who headed the electoral ticket of
the Democratic party. These figures
show xhat the Republican ticket was
given a fraction more than two out of
every three ballots cast, an unprece
dented record in San Francisco.
.The difference between the vote of
Tuesday and that of the national elec
tion of 1900 is not as great as was ex
pected. In 1900 the total vote was 63,
152, only 3587 less than that cast at the
elecion just concluded. The registra
tion showed a difference between 1904
and 1900 of almost 10,000, and in view
of this fact it is difficult to explain the
small difference between the total votes
cact at the election of these years. It is
held by some, however, that when the
voters registered for the election just
passed they thought they were going to
have a fight on their hands, but the
apathy of the Democrats in the State
soon removed this probability, and,
accepting the result of the contest as a
foregone conclusion, thousands did not
take the trouble to vote.
The semi-official count of the ballots
cast In San Francisco at Tuesday's
election was completed early yesterday
morning. The average for the various
candidates established by the figures
given out late the night before by the
Registrar and published yesterday
morning was maintained throughout
and the Ust of victors remains as first
announced. The complete returns now
In the hands of the Registrar are as
follows:

Leaders of the party In Los Angeles
were yesterday informed of the tre

It Is estimated at State Committee
headquarters that Duncan E. McKin
iay's plurality In the Second Con-
KieEsional District will reach 2000.
Special credit for the happy result is
Riven to the stalwart Republicans of
Marin and Mendoclno counties. The
bettir.g in Napa, that the late Demo
cratic candidate would defeat McKin
lay. wa6 continued until 8 o'clock
1 uesday evenin?. The amount of
money lost by the misguided followers
of Bell is very large, but they have
this consolation. The election of Mc-
Kinlay guarantees a continuation of
prosperous conditions, and by dint of
industry aid the practice of reason
able economy they can acquire more
money during the ensuing two years.
"The darkest cloud has a silver lin
ing."
it is common gossip that the Cali
fornia Republican delegation -will not
ask Congress to restore the abolished:
canteen. It is closed and that is the
cr.d of the chapter. A bill, has been
framed for introduction in the Legis
lature to make it unlawful to sell
liquor within n radius of four miles
of the home. This bill will close sroi;
. series ucar the home, where pension
ers are debauched and robbed.
â¢Silcnr-ii. reigne-d yesterday at the
headquarters of the Democratic State
Central Committee. Secretary Thomas
K. WaJsh and a clerk or two worked
quietly packing up what little political
ammunition that remained in the
Fhape of pamphlets and proclama
tions. They did not even theorize as to
how ?t happened.

California has given Roosevelt a'majorlty beyond the wildest dreams of
the most optimistic of the party leaders. Some ventured to predict that he
would have a plurality of 60,000, but no one in the State had dared to venture
an estimate as high. as 100,000. Roosevelt's majority, with returns nearly
complete, stands at 112.883. His total vote already reaches 198.568. the
greatest the" Golden State has ever srlven a candidate for the Presidency.
The majority of 40,000 given McKiiiley four years ago fades into insig
nificance.when compared to the present figures.' The vote by counties fol
lows:
In each of the eight Congressional districts in the State the Republi
can candidate was elected. The majorities range from 20,000 in the Third
and Seventh, where Know-land and McLaehlan won out respectively, to 1000
in the Second, where Bell gave McKinlay the closest race. Wynn, LJver
nash and Bell will give way in the House to Hayes, Kahn and McKinlay.
Knowland will fill the place made vacant by Metcalf's elevation to the
Cabinet; Needham, Gillett and McLaehlan will succeed themselves, and
Smith in the Eighth will take Daniels' place.

BERKELEY. Nov. 9. â Dr. Archi
bald R. Ward, head of the department
of veterinary science and bacteriology
at the State University, haa been ap
pealed to. by dairymen of Berkeley to
Investigate for them the problem of
"ropey" milk which' has worried them
for several weeks.
In some of the dairies the milk dis
pensed would form into strings or
ropes within a few hours after the
cows were milked. The milk was not
made sour nor unpleasant to the taste,
but the strings were objected to by
customers and so the dairymen sought
Dr. Wawl's advice. He tested the milk
and informed the dairymen that un
sanitary conditions in their barns and
sheds were responsible for the objec
tionable features of their dairy pro
duet. Dr. Ward has given the dairy
men advice in detail as to what meas
ures should be taken to keep the milk
in normal .condition and no more
trouble is expected.

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 6.
i Dear Sir: We. the undersigned, members
cf a cominltteo appointed by the men of the
senior class of the university to cdtnmunlcate
to you the sentiment of the men of the clasa
ccccernlnjr the orders that members of the
class In military "A must line up an the
roadway la front of North Hail before pro
ceeding to the classroom, would respectfully
call your attention to the following facts:
â¢ 1. That the members of the class In mil
itary ' 2A . did not understand the reasons or
Joseph Loeb ! and Eugene Hallett,
prominent classmen, waited upon Cap
tain-Nance during the afternoon and
asked for a reply to their letter which
was sent the captain two. days .ago.
Captain Nance ignored the letter and
the seniors wanted to know what his
reason was for doing bo.
Loeb and Hallett stated tha seniors*
case at length, and Captain Nance
heard them through. They reiterated
the arguments made in their formal
'letter to the military instructor, and
.when they finished. Captain Nance is
sued the following ultimatum, sayincr:
"After hearing you. I will Inform you
that I am now preparing a letter to
ithe senior class, which you will re
ceive soon. I do not tell you now what
that letter will contain, but I do say
that if, after you have received my
written statement, you then desire to
talk further or go further in this mat
ter, I will hear you, or read your state
ments. That Is all."
The ultimatum concluded the inter
view. .The seniors now have to specu
late upon the character of the com
munication which Nance says he is pre
paring for their perusal.
The following is the communication
filed with Captain Nance two days aco
by the seniors, who appointed the com
mittee of three, consisting of Joseph
Loeb, Gustav "White and John S. Ed
wards, to .prepare and present it:
BERKELEY, Nov.. 9.â Oaptain J. T.
Nance, military Instructor at the uni
versity,, whose ortiers to,the senior class
to preserve . order when enterins: the
classroom caused trouble for him and
the faculty, met a deputation of seniors
to-day and with them discussed the
situation.
For the?e reasons the men of the senloi
cl&ss. of whom the class In military 2A largely
consists, are opposed to the order requiring
the mÂ«n taking this course to line tip on the
roadway In front of North Hall and march
in line to the lecture-room and do respect
fully request that hereafter the members of
the course In military 2A be allowed to enter
the lecture-room - In the same manner that
they enter any other lecture-room la the uni
versity and that the roll be taken In the
room and discipline bÂ« maintained there tn
any wÂ»y the Instructor may direct. Respect
fully. JOSEPH P. LOEB, Â»
J GCSTAV WHITE.
JOHN S. ET>WARD9.
Committee from the Men of the Senior CIsss,
University of California.
7. That these seniors also believe that say
such disturbance, may be easily avoided, dis
cipline more effectually maintained and the
class seated In thÂ« lecture room more quickly
and quietly If they bÂ« not required to form
Into line In the roadway and march Into
North Hall and upstairs.
B. But that thÂ« disturbance brought about
on Wednesday. November 2. by the attempt
to form the members of the clasa tn military
2A In line according to order wu caused for
thÂ« most part by the members of the threÂ«
lower classes, who rushed and scattered the
sections whenever the section marchers at
tempted to fail In.
6. That the senior men who arÂ« registered
for the course In military 2A believe that any
attempt to form such a line In the roadway
In front of North Hall offers great temptation
and Is practically an Invitation to ail other
students to rush the men who are. attempting
to fall Into line.
3. That the members of the lower classes
In tha university interpreted these order* and
their execution to be a humiliation of the
men of the senior class, which sentiment Is
hurtful to the proper exercise of the senior
control advocated by faculty and students.
4. That the men of the class tn military
3A made a mistake In not taking concerted
action and protesting these orders to ths
proper authorities before trouble ensued.
motives for these orders. No other cla*a.
however large or unruly, has ever been forced
to enter a classroom In this manrter. No at
tempt whs made In this casft to explain the
reason for this departure from, the traditional
manner of aanembltng Into classrooms In tha
University of California.
2. That this misunderstanding led to re
bellious feelings on the part of the members
of the class In military 2A- They felt that,
on the part of the faculty members Issuing
them, these orders showed a lack of regard
and consideration for the customary methods
of instruction In this university and for the
tlmÂ«-honored privilege of students to assemble
from their previous recitation In a manner
most convenient to them.

It is astonishing what an advance the Jap
anese soldier has made in a few years In the
art of war. Wlien I have looked at positions
stormed by the troops of the first army and
carried succesKfully by them, I can only say
that If any man had told me a year a^o such
thlrus could have been done In the face of
modern weajions of warfare, ' I would havt
been constrained to call that man a fool.
If you had been In my position you would
have seen men rush out upon a gradual slope,
one man with a pick, feverishly digging- up a
few clods of earth until he wan shot - down.
Then another rushed up, taking his place, us
lns the first body as a shield and throwing
up more earth. When several men had died
the impromptu trench was made.
The Japanese soldier values his life not a
whit as compared with his duty, and yet at
the same time he does not throw away His
life unnecessarily. Every trick, every ruse.
The Russians are not discouraged
their reverses, according to Mr. Mc-
Kenzie, and have determined to fight
to tho end. He spoke of the bravery of
the Japanese soldiers and added:
Two men capable of relating many
interesting experiences had in. the Far
East arrived yesterday on the steam
ship Manchuria. They are F. A. Mc-
Kenzie, correspondent of the London
Daily Mail, who has been with the
Japanese army, and Captain Alexan
der Kirkwood, who commanded the
steamship Mlneola that was wrecked
last August on the coast of > Kam
chatka.
Mr. McKenzie Is on his way to Lon
don and, unlike most of the returning
scribes who have seen service in the
"thick o' the battle," he does not com
plain of the severity of the Japanese
censorship or of the restrictions that
the Japanese officials placed upon the
seeker for news.
Mr. McKenzie thinks that he had
every reasonable opportunity to ob
tain news of the- battles, but he says
that the Japanese officials were not
versed in the requirements of modern
newspapers and often overlooked mat
ters of Importance that they had no
intention of "holding out" on the news
paper men.
For twenty-four days the crew lived
with the natives on the bleak northern
shores. They, were finally rescued by
the British -cruiser Algerine and taken
to Hakodate, f'om which port they
were transferred . to Yokohama, where
they procured passage on the Man
churia for home.-
Mr. McKenzie cannot speak confi
dently of the future. The Japanese, he
says, are showing greater financial
stability than was expected and they
have plans in contemplation which will
doubtless provide' funds for next year's
campaign. In February they should
have half a million men In the field
with plenty of money to buy food for
them. At the same\time the Russians
are steadily strengthening themselves.
They have awakened to the serious
ness, of the war. They know what a
permanent defeat means for them in
Asia. It Is very possible that next
year they may successfully Invade
Northern Korea and threaten the south
of the present Japanese position.
Captain Alexander Kirkwood and
crew of the steamship Mlneola, wreck
ed August 5 on , the coast of j Kam
chatka, were glad to get back to San
Francisco. The vessel, went ashore on
an uncharted reef near Tigel bar and
stuck hard and fast, as she was draw-j
ing- twenty-two .feet. .of water at the
time. After a futile effort to get the
vessel off< she was abandoned by her
captain and crew and they reached the
shore in the small boats. The vessel
afterward broke up and became a
total loss. Â¦ Â¦ -
every bluff that you can imagine he will adopt
ta deceive the. enemy.
Yet the Russian soldier has in his way qual
ities quite aa remarkable. At the outset the
Russians. despised their, enemy. . They were not
prepared for the war, and how unprepared the
world does not know. They treated, the Jap
anese as a puny dwarf to be stamped out with
Impunity, and the Russians have had a rude
awakening. But the Russian, In spite of de
feat following defeat. Is still full of fight.
After each lost battle he fights more obsti
nately than ever. I have seen Russian troops,
In defiance of orders, stand and die opposing
a vastly superior column of the foe.

At that moment a car passed and
the fugitive sprang aboard it and thus
disappeared from his pursuers, who,
by that time, numbered a score of
armed men. He rode a half mile and
then caught a car on another line. On
the seat he had occupied the carmen
found a large pool of blood.
Every available officer was rushed
to the scene and a thorough search was
made for the wounded man, but he
has not yet been captured. Every
physician in the city has been notified
of the case and if the man applies for
medical treatment he is practically cer
tain to be arrested.
On the street near the place he met
Miss Lena Johnson, who was riding a
bicycle. Seizing the wheel he tried to
wrest it from the young woman's
grasp, but she struggled with him and
held the wheel. As other men were
approaching, the fugitive left her and
continued to run. Her clothing was
covered with his blood, showing that
he had been badly wounded.
Two blocks away the burglar ran
against G. W. McDonald, a well known
citizen, who was also on a bicycle.
Covering McDonald with his revolver
the man ordered 4 him to dismount, but
McDonald, even when threatened with
death, refused to give up his wheel.
The man tried to force it from him,
but was too weak.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 9.â On the
front porch of the residence of E. L.
Doheny, in Chester place, the most pa
latial private residence in the city, oc
curred to-night a most sensational re
volver duel.
Detecting a man supposed to be a
professional porch-climber in the act of
trying to break into the house J. S.
Hendrickson, a special policeman, ap
proached for the purpose of investigat
ing the man's action, and as he reached
out to grab the intruder the burglar
opened fire at a distance of less than
three feet. r ? :v^ ' ~
The first bullet passed through the
officer's coat, struck a card case and
was deflected. A second shot struck
him on the point of the elbow and chip
ped off a small piece of the bone. Then
riendrickson got his own revolver into
action and his first shot struck the
thief in the region of the abdomen and
caused him to reel and fall down the
porch stairs, but he quickly regained
his feet, crossed the lawn and at the
street line turned and fired again at
the officer, but missed him. Hendrick
son returned the fire and again the
man fell, but rising before the officer
reached him, he started to run. He
was closely pursued and kept shooting
as long as there was a load in his gun,
and then reloaded as he ran.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Mr. Bennett's facial expression was
a study in bewilderment as he shuffled
bsck to the cage.
"Conceded. But you are not charged
with vagrancy. The policeman has
sworn that you were drunk and dis
orderly and annoying churchgoers-
Those offenses are not condoned by the
appearance of your hands. Like many
other men who have stood where you
row stand, Mr. Bennett, you appar
ently labor under the delusion that In
dustrlousness should offset any crime
on the statute books. The fact that you
work for a livelihood does not wipe out,
or even mitigate, the offenses of which
you virtually acknowledge guilt. I'll
sentence you to-morrow."
"They certainly do look toilworn,"
said the Judge, "but I fail to see how
their condition can be made to cut any
figure In this case." ;
"They ehow that I ain't a vag," said
the defendant.
Alexander Bennett, who was arrested
for drunkenness and disorderly conduct
at Montgomery avenue and Vallejo
street last Sunday morning, smiled con
fidently as he stretched forth a pair of
gnarled and horny hands to Judge Mo
gan and asked him to Inspect them.
"If them ain't the hands of a work
ingman, I'd like to 'know what they
are." Mr. Bennett remarked.
John McGee and Rudolph Muller first
met at a water front polling place and
voted the same ticket. After perform
ing that function of citizenship they
adjourned to a tightly locked saloon in
which not a drop of liquor could be
procured for either love or money, and
there they cemented their - new-made
friendship and became so mutually at
tached that in the breakaway John
acquired a pair of spectacles, two to
ba.cco pipes and a change of socks and
Rudolf lost exactly the same property.
The charge against John before Judge
Mogan .was petty larceny, but Rudolf
reported\ that he had recovered his be
longings ar.d would respectfully decline
to prosecute. Case dismissed.
Willlam Diedrlch, arrested in China
town for disorderly conduct, confessed
that he was a slave of opium and had
smoked so many pipefulis of the pre
pared drug last Tuesday that he saw
things that had no material existence
and fled from imaginary pursuers.
That's how he came to be scantily
clothed and terror-stricken when a po
liceman captured him.
"I'm a poor unfortunate," he whined,
as he stood before Judge Mogan, "and
you ci/nnot punish me any more than
I'm punishing myself."
"I bdieve that," said the Judge. "Go
back to Chinatown and stay there."
"Election. He's a very old and dear
friend of mine, and when the intelli
gence of his triumph was announcedâ"
Mr. McCauley was sent back to the
cells to read the morning newspapers
and Incidentally acquire complete so-
Thomas McCauley, whose sobriquet
of "Beacon Light" apparently was
founded upon the perennial crimson of
his nasal organ, smiled affably at
Judge Morgan and asked how the elec
tion returns suited him. Ignoring the
query, his Honor expressed desire to
know what Mr. McCauley meant by
disturbing the nocturnal peace of Com
mercial street, between Montgomery
and Kearny. by wildly screeching.
"My screeches, as you are pleased to
term what really were exultant cheers,"
said the defendant, "were inspired by
the news of Judge Parker's election."
"Judge Parker's what!"
Clarence Johnson, 23 years of age, in
sisted that he be convicted of vagrancy
just to humiliate his respectable and
indulgent parents, but Judge Cabaniss
declined to pamper the youth's whim
and roundly scored him for his unfilial
malice. Patrolmen McGrane and David
testified that the young man informed
them he was a vagrant and asked that
they arrest and so charge him, but
after complying with his request they
ascertained that his ulterior motive was
to bring sorrow upon his father and
mother, with whom he had quarreled.
Joseph Hennessey, also accused of;
carrying a concealed weapon, was so
tall that he looked like a half shut
jackknife as he bent over the bench
of Department No. 1 and informed its
occupant that his conviction would be
an inexcusable perversion of justice,
because he did not know the weapon
was in his pocket until a policeman
fished it out. His case was continued
until his character has been inquired
into, and as he straightened up his
form to retire from the presence a
chandelier narrowly escaped demolition
by his head.
Henry J. Rogers, in whose possession
was a fully loaded revolver when he
was arrested on Pacific street for
drunkenness, pleaded that he recently
arrived from Humboldt County, where
pistol carrying is not regarded as a
law fracture, and has not yet entirely
adjusted his personal habits to con
form with his new environment. He
was fined J5 and advised to return to
the redwoods.
Louis Kirschbaum, who caused the
arrest of Griffith Wells on the charge
of Illegally voting at Sacramento and
Leidesdorff street, declined to sweat
to a formal complaint, and an attorney
for the Merchants' Association has
decided to have the case more thor
oughly investigated.
Kirschbaum declared that Wells had
no right to vote from 641 Commercial
street, as he did not reside there, but
Charles Schener testified' that Wells
has lived there for the last eighteen
months a:fd was duly qualified to vote
as he did. Kirschbaum then acknowl
edged that it was on hearsay he caused
the arrest to be made. Wells is a waiter
at the Helping Hand Mission and has
a good character.
walked out with it, followed by his
chums. The trio was hastening ferry
ward when Patrolmen Culllnan, Dretel
and Nolan, who had been notified by
the bartender, overtook and arrested
all three and recovered their plumder.
When the case was cailed before
Judge Cabaniss the attorney for the
defense threw his clients upon the
mercy of the court and pleaded that
their alleged theft was simply a col
legians' lark. His Honor asked the
youths what they Intended to do with
the machine, and they answered with
single voice that their purpose was
to return it to the saloon after the
mixologist had been sufficiently scared
by its protracted absence. Then the
court dismissed them.
AWPORD.
BYJ. C. CR
Of the many sad faces that passed
la Irregular procession yesterday morn
ing before the bench of Police Judge
Mogan there was not one more reflect
ive of depression of spirit than was the
countenance of Miss Aileene Hill, ac
cused of stealing a diamond ring from
Romeo Hale, a would-be wooer, and
presenting it to Tornaso Felepedas, her
preferred suitor, as a love token. The
woman seemed to fe*;l that she was
doubly lost, for Romeo resolutely swore
she stole the bauble and Tomaso as
severated he had never seen it.
It was at the defendant's residence
iu the 800 block of Howard street the
alleged robbery occurred. Romeo called
there with a male friend one night last
week and Aileene entenained them so
charmingly with beer and pretzels
and small talk that Romeo's friend
confessed reluctance to tear himself
away, although he realized three were
a. crowd. After his departure Aileene
continued to amuse Romeo with artless
prattle, punctuated with beer at proper
intervals, until the fatigue engendered
by a clay's manual toil, combined with
indulgence in malt liquor, gradually
dulled his senses to complete oblivion.
"When he awoke Aileene was still talk
ing, but a diamond . ring, valued at 550,
was no longer on his left sma.ll finger.
When he requested her to produce the
jewel, as he desired to so home, she
waxed indignant. Then he went forth
and caused her arrest.
The policeman in the case testified
that Aileene confessed to him she took
ihe ring and grave it to Tomaso while
Romeo slept. Taken before Tomaso
she reiterated that statement, but he
omphaticaily pronounced it untrue so
far as he was concerned. Aileene was
nore staggered by Tomaso's denial, the
<jfÂ»lcer said, than by her arrest. She
cast herself upon her knees, clasped
her hands and beseeched him to pro
duce the ring and save her from prison,
but he could not be shaken by her im
ploration.
That is how the case stand?. Alleene's
attorney asserts the ring is a myth,
and darkly insinuates that the allega
tion of theft is a malicious effort on
lomeo's part to avenge himself on the
voman who prefers another's atten
innf to his own. Tomaso's attorney
r.Eists on dismissal of his client, who,
;ven if he did accept the ring as al
fged by Aileene, cannot be held as an
Lccpmplice in the theft. Romeo's at
t.rney assumes ability to prove not
only that the ring was a reality, but
also that Romeo purchased and wore

the case to-morrow.

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL,. '
l-Tesjr IVople Know How Useful It Is in I
Pr^-scrvlnc Health and Beauty. ;
Nearly everybody knov.-s that char- j
cral is the safest and most efficient j
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value when taken Into
ihe human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more j
;ouÂ»take of it the better; it is not ai
drug at all, but simply absorbs the j
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the. breath after
smoking,' drinking or after eating 1 !
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
tn th and further acts as a natural and
eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious pases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; ft
disinfects ihe mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
willow charcoal and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting
lozenges, the charcoal being mixed
with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell In a much Improved condi-
tion of the g-eneral health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and purer
blood, and the beautv of it is that no
possible harm can result from their /
continued use. but on the contrary,
great benefit.
A Buffalo physir Â«->*!. in speaking; of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering: from gas in stomach
and bowel?, and to clear the com-
plexion and purify the breath, mouth
and throat; I also believe the liver is
srr<?atly benefited by the daily use of
them: they cost but twenty-five cents
n box at drug stores, and. although
It, some sense a patent preparation, yet
I believe I get more and better char-
oonl in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges
than in an- of the ordinary charcoal
taMeta."

This Is quite a good picture of Mlstf
Kate Erhardt. who lives at 61S Tig ave-
nue, Santa Barbara, Cal. Miss Erhardt
had suffered for years with distressing
asthma. It is needless to describe
asthma to the unfortunates who suffer
from this awful disease. All suffeiera
from asthma realize what it means .to
smother and cough and fight for breath
as thÂ« majority of these sufferers hava
to do when a bad paroxysm of asthma
comes on. Miss Erhaxdt suffered from
the worst form of asthma for years,
was taking all kinds of medical treat-
ment, which did her no good. She came
to the Elactro-Chemic Institute. 118
Grant avenue, San Francisco, and took
just six weeks' treatment. -.. In that time
she was thoroughly cured of her asthma
and has now returned to her home in
Santa Barbara thoroughly and perma-
nently cured. Such cures as this is con-
stantly adding additional proof that thÂ©
Electro-Chemic treatment does euro
diseases which In the past have been in-
curable under the ordinary medical
treatment used for them. Any one is at
liberty to write Miss Erhardt and she
will be only too glad to substantiate this
statement in every particular. Such
cures as this explain why the Electro-
Chemic practice is now the largest spe-
cial practice on the Pacific Coast. It ex-
plains why other physicians with a few
electrical instruments are trying to imi-
tate Electro-Chemistry. Such cures
should make it plain to all sufferers it
they desire an absolutely reliable treat-
ment they should try to go to the orig-
inal institution, the Electro-Chemic In-
stitute, which is meeting with such un-
qualified success. The specialists of the
Electro-Chemic Institute invite all suf-
ferers to call for free consultation. . ex-
amination and advice. The afflicted
should remember that the Electro-
Chemic practice is the most successful
treatment known for the cure of Ca-
tarrh. Consumption. Asthma. Bronchitis^
Deafness, Ringing Ears. Rheumatism.
Paralysis. Locomotor Ataxia. Neuralgia.
Cancers. Tumors. Old Sores, Eczema.
Dyspepsia, Liver Trouble. Kidney and
Bladder troubles. Bright's Disease.
Piles. Fistula. Constipation. Headaches.
Dizziness. Insomnia, Epilepsy. Stricture,

centrally located at 118 Grant ave-
nue, corner cf Post street. San Fran-
cisco. There are private apartments
set aside for ladies and gentlemen, and
the office hours are daily from 9 in thÂ«
morning until 5 In the afternoon, and 7
to 8 at night, , and Sundays from 10 In
the mnrnlnjj until 1 In. the afternoon.
The Electro-Chemic treatment is abso-
lutely painless. Small children and
even babies are now taking it without
the least complaint. It is the most won-
derful treatment known for shattered
nerves, and in those .bad cases where
the physical strength is all gone the pa-
tient Is built up and made stronger and
thoroughly cured so quickly that it is
almost impossible to realize the change
in the sufferer. All are welcome, but no
incurable cases are accepted.

THE promptness and efficiency of the bulletin service which gave
to eager thousands the first and the most complete returns of
the election on Tuesday afternoon and evening gives The Call
cause for pardonable pride. It was through specially arranged
channels that the news of Roosevelt's election came to The Call of
fice at 3 :5O p. m. â the first authentic statement of the result of the
national election to appear upon a bulletin board in the city.
Shortly after 6 o'clock The Call announced the election of Hayes and
Kahn. again leading in giving the news to the people. Within an
hour the successful candidates in the local judiciary fight were
posted, and thus, until midnight brought final returns from East and
West, the promptness of the bulletin announcements was continued.
In making arrangements to meet the emergencies of election
The Call spared no effort in organization nor halted at expense. ' For
the local returns special wires from the office of- the Registrar con
veyed the reports of the paper's special reporters there watching the
count. For procuring with such dispatch and accuracy the Eastern
reports The Call has to make acknowledgment to the Western
Union Telegraph Company, which, by special arrangement with the
paper, transmitted all the difficult maze of figures from the hundreds
of points of political activity direct to our office without error.
FIRST WITH THE RETURNS.
Those days are over. Life has shed
Its Attic salt, its, vernal sap
(As all will gather who have read
Me on the "Marriage Handicap") ;
And, therefore, when to wife and home
I hear a husband murmur -vale-
I know Just why. he wants to roam;
I sympathize with poor "Bill Bailey!"
âPunch.
When I return, at four or so,
Engrossed with duty's strenuous
grind,
I wish to bandy Jeux-de-mots
In converse with a kindred mind;
Hit by a slump in "Dover A,"
A wild canard, a wanton rumor,
I'd like to wash my cares away
With Jets of 8wif t responsive humor.
Oh, salon days! Oh, golden times.
When wit would wed with femmes
d'esprlt
And armed with neat impromptu
rhymes
Always came home to repartee;
When women sat by humor's throne,
And, all alert to wrest his laurels.
In each department held their own,
Even including that of morals.
Could woman grasp the views of men
Upon the role of perfect wife.
What hopes a husband nurses when
He launches out on married life,;
She might contrive to get her brain
Equipped with intellectual tackle.
And spare her lord the constant strain
Of driveling, frivoling, henroost cackle.
Her damnably expensive taste
In frills and feathers, fronts and
toques,
Could, by a sacrifice, be faced
Had she the sense to see my Jokes;
But as for any answering sign
When I throw oft a scintillation.
I might be casting pearls to swineâ
They'd show as much appreciation.
(In these lines, which do not neces
sarily reflect his own views, the author
ventures to assume the attitude of a
certain correspondent to the London
Times, who, in a recent letter under
the above heading, passed some severe
strictures upon the modern wife. His
diatribe included the following re
marks: . "The vapid insipidities, the
idle tittle-tattle that too often do duty
for conversation disgust, if they do not
bore, the man whose business life is
something more serious than a round
of frivol and drivel. The clever man
may no more make a clever remark
than the cricketer- may bowl right
handed to the lady cricketers. Oh, for
an hour of the ancient salons!")
'Tls not her love of gaudy gear.
Her hopeless vanity of heart.
Her passion, vulgar but sincere,
To earn the epithet of "smart";
These foibles â fatuous, I admit â
Might pass as relatively venial,
If only in the. sphere of wit
She proved a shade less uncongenial.

(FROM THE PACIFIC WINE AND SPIRIT REVIEW.)
The daily papers notwithstanding all their parade of alleged interest In
the welfare of the State, and consequently, in all its industries, large or
small, constitute a cheap lot, and the proof of this assertion is to be
found in their own columns. The victories of California at the "World's Fair
are certainly news of the greatest Interest to the entire State, but, never
j theless, there was only one daily paper that published the awards, not
withstanding our exhibits won unexampled distinction at the exposition.
Here is the explanation of this remarkable fact: The Call had the enter
prise to send a special representative to the fair, while the other fat dailies
depended on the Associated Press for news. As a consequence, the Call
on the 20th InBtant published, exclusively, the grand list of prizes won by
this State, in a contest against the world. This was vital news, but because
they were "scooped" none of the other papers deigned to mention the
awards, either In the newa or editorial columns. That was certainly juve
nile journalism with a vengeance and ought to cost such cheap editors a
long list of subscribers.

The record of achievement which the National Municipal
League has to show for its efforts is a good one. It works for the
betterment of city life and the economy of city government and con
sequently it should receive every encouragement.
r T > HERE has just been published and circulated throughout the
I larger cities of the country a circular report of the proceedings
of the recent Chicago conference held by the National Municipal
League. Incorporated therein is a great deal of material significant
of the work this association is doing for civic reform and municipal
improvement throughout all of the cities in which it has representa
tion. Reports of work actually accomplished give cheering evidence
of the growth of concerted effort in the beautifying of municipal
environs and the purification of municipal governments.
The aims of the National Municipal League deserve to attract
all that have pride in the appearance of their home city and a keen
interest in the administration of its machinery of government. The
twofold object of the league, the adornment of municipalities by
parks. driveways and such works of a public character, and the re
organization and modernizing- of city charters on models insuring
economy of effort and the permanency of solid business system, has
found justification in successful application in many Eastern cities.
In New York a branch of the league has trained men to keep in
close touch with legislation at Albany concerning the city's common
municipal interests. The work of a committee of the league in'pre
paring for Milwaukee the most serviceable method of municipal
accounting and the collection of municipal statistics has served as a
standard for similar revision of method in many other cities. In the
matter of civic adornment and reform of all unsightliness Kalama

Ohio, has passed severe restrictive measures against the obtrusive
signboard.

THE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL LEAGUE.
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT will
receive as an inauguration gift a
quilt composed of 22,642 pieces, the
handiwork of Mrs. Charlotte J. Creig
mile of 5237 Larchwood avenue. Phila
delphia, Says the North American.
The quilt is made entirely of satin in
the national colors â red, white and
blue. Neither the reds nor blues are
solid colors, but each is finely shaded,
lessening the contrast .and enhancing
the color value of the whole. The ma
terials alone cost upward of $100.
It was Mrs. Creigmile's intention to
present the quilt to President McKin
l*y, but he was assassinated before it
was completed. She has waited some
years to see if Roosevelt, as a Presi
dent, were worthy the gift, and she is
now entirely satisfied. She had no
doubt of his election either.
"There's not much danger of that;
but if it should happen I'll give it to
him before," Mrs. Creigmile replied-
To a remark ', that perhaps Parker
Â¦would appreciate the quilt if elected
she declared vigorously: "Xot a bit of
it! Give my quilt to a Democrat? I
guess not!"
Mrs. Creigmile worked on the quilt
and the two pillow shams that match
Jt In odd moments for several years.
When exhibited in a fair conducted by
the women of the Baptist Temple the
quilt excited unstinted admiration and
was pronounced a wonderful piece of
needlework.
"Perhaps Roosevelt will not be elect
ed, and then the auilt cannot be an
inauguration gift," a visitor suggested
the other day.
MRS. CREIGMILE AT WORK ON HER QUILT. WHICH THE PRESIDENT WILL,
RECEIVE AS AN INAUGURATION PRESENT. THIS "WONDERFUL QUILT IS
COMPOSED OF 22.W2 PIECES OF RED, WHITE AND BLUE SATIN.
The Call was the first to stand for a well-qualified and non
partisan judiciary by advocating the election of the four incumbents
to the Superior bench. It is gratifying that when the people voted
they nicely discriminated between their duty as partisans and their
duty as citizens by supporting the four tried and true incumbents
iind proving that a Judge need have no fear that he will be forgotten
if he do his duty, impartially, without fear or favor.
The Call salutes its readers and all who trusted its judgment
and its disinterested position. Hereafter it will be easier for San
Francisco to be right and for men to be faithful. We commented
currently on the unexcited nature of the national campaign. Com
mittees of both parties feared that it meant such indifference to the
result as would cause a very light vote. The opposite proved to be
true. The vote is very heavy. In the pivotal States an unusually
large percentage of the total registration was cast, which proves
that a red fire and brass band campaign is not necessary to get out
the vote. In the large cities there were no immense processions.
There were no campaign uniforms worn and no badges nor buttons.
The result was brought about everywhere by the sober thought of
the people, and therefore it means something.
I~*\ Y a decision that staggers the mind in its unanimity and volume
r% of majorities the country has centered responsibility upon the
*â* Republican party. As far as President Roosevelt is concerned,
his view of it may be judged by his comment on the party victory
of 1902, when he' said: "The country has given the Republican
party a chance to make good." Under his masterful leadership the
party will make good, and guided by him will give every man a
"square deal" under the law. Since Washington no man has entered
upon a Presidential term freer than he of all obligations that conflict
with public duty, and we predict that he will close his term and his
public service the most successful and popular of American Presi
dents and will take his place high in the history of his country.
. A feature of the election that is interesting is the obvious fact
that tens of thousands of Democrats voted for Roosevelt, but sup
ported parts of their local ticket Notwithstanding that, however,
the Republican majority in the next House is largely increased and
die party's power to "make good" is greater than ever.
It is gratifying that to this increase California adds the three
scats in the House that' were lost two years ago. The Call's fight
was made to regain those seats, and we made it a clean fight, ap
pealing only to the reason of men and not to their passions and
prejudices. We had no personal feeling against Messrs. Livernash,.
Wynn and Bell. They were simply three men out of place. A public
mistake and failure of judgment had put them where they did not
belong. They were not blameworthy for aspiring. The people were
at fault. They thought that the men could "make good" and justify
their elevation. But they failed, and the people have corrected the
mistake. That correction gains for us three splendid Representa
tives. In Kahn, Hayes and McKinlay the State will have three
Working members who will be alert in safeguarding our interests and
maintaining our good repute. We congratulate them much and the
State more.
THE RESULT, GENERAL AND LOCAL.
So on through to the end the letter
ran. Miss Griggs did not answer the
letter and she has recently received
a second letter from Mr. Butler, in
closing a stamp for reply and plead
ing at great length and, in turn, for
an answer, her love and 55000 of her
money. He said:
My Dear Friend Clittle (If you allow me to
call you puch) : â You mu6t not get angry, but
please read all this scribbling. It may be true
that you are getting many letters; but will add
that there is not one of them that needs as
sistance from you as I do. I know if I could
have a personal interview with you, you would
not. turn me down. I have concluded that
you are a fine girl and nothing would give me
more pleasure than to be able to call you my
Miss Griggs does not deign to answer
any of them, and, as a result, the
writers have, with one exception, sub
sided into silence after one letter. The
one exception is an Iowa man. He
gives his name as Butler and his ad
diess at Whittemore, Iowa. His first
letter to Miss Griggs covered three
sheets and was closely written. In it
he mixes business and sentiment by
alternately declaring that he wanted
to love her and begging for $5000 to
"put him on his feet again."
The first letter says in part:
Miss Clitiie Grisrf", Kansas City, Mo.
My Dear Friend: â I have read of your good
fortune in setting a half million dollars. It
will be nice for a. young and beautiful girl
like you are. I am a poor man and want to
ask you to help me. I have been eick and have
lost out Â»o that I am about on my last ground.
V."on't you rive me $5000 to start in the drug
business with? Or, no; I don't want you to
give me the money. Let me have it and I
will repay you. That sum will be Â«mall to you
and would be such a help to mÂ«, who needs a
lift so eorely. Now, dear lady, remember
the Bible says it is good to give, and you
won't mis* it. I have worked hard all my
life and have not squandered my money, but
you knew we all have bad luck at times.
The letters from men who desire the
young woman for a -wife, and, inci
dentally, her half million, although
they all declare they love her for her
self and not for the money's sake, are
most interesting to the disinterested
reader, for Miss Griggs declares she
will pay no attention to them.
SINCE the recent announcement
that Miss Clittie Griggs. a tele
phone girl, employed with a Kan
sas City grain commission company,
had received a half million dollar be
-quest from a cousin in Alaska, she has
received letters from persons all oVer
the Middle West Most of these have
been from men, some proposing mar
riage; others asking for money, and
still others begging her to let them
have the money to invest or perfect
inventions. But the women have not
teen far behind with appeals to the
young heiress. Representatives of so
cieties and associations have requested
her to give part of her money to them.

The affair may be said to have been
"continuous," having its origin in the

PERSONAL.
By most of his hearers, who to-night
had their first opportunity of hearing
the Foreign Office's views and who.
hitherto, had based their ideas on Mr.
Balfour's much-criticized Southampton
speech, and belligerent editorial arti
cles in the newspapers. Lord Lans
downe's utterances were regarded al
most as a plea for Russia.
A dead silence greeted him. as. after
pointing out that the two Governments
in good faith believe in contradictory
staterpents of facts, he asked:
"Could we have done better than tret
full apology and compensation and
leave the question of facts to an in
ternational tribunal with a guarantee
of punishment of any who may be
found guilty?"
Lord Lansdowne, in connection with
the question of contraband seriously
reminded the audience that Great Bri
tain as the greatest naval power mleht
Bome day be the greatest sufferer by a
restriction of belligerent rights on the
high eeas.
After referring to "the \rldely preval
ent desire" that arbitration mieht be
resorted to. In the case of the present
war in the Far East, Lord Lansdowne
added:
"Mr. Choate walked into my room
yesterday and asked if we would sien
an arbitration treaty with the United
States. Simultaneously I received from
President Roosevelt, whom all must
congratulate (cheers), a message Invit
ing us to participate in a second Inter
national peace conference at The
Haprue. It was needless to say that the
invitation has not been refused, onlv
we have reserved to ourselves the rieht
to consider the subjects that should be
discussed. We hesitated not a moment
in Informing America that we were
ready to participate and in wishing
President Roosevelt Godspeed in this
undertaking. Arbitration," concluded
Lord Lansdowne, after a sympathetic
reference to France's assistance in the
North sea dispute, "has become the
fashion."
Then came an impassioned review of
the North Sea affair. Although Lord
Lansdowne was unable to announce the
signing of the convention, he emphati
cally confirmed statements made in
these dispatches, namely, that Great
Britain had found "no difficulty in ar
riving at a solution in principle of the
dispute," and only supplemented what
is already known by the statement
that Russia has guaranteed the punish
ment of any other officers in addition
to those already detached from Ad
miral Rojestvensky's squadron, who
rnight be proven to have been impli
cated.
LONDON. Nov. 9.â Lord Lansdowne,
In the absence of Premier BaJfour, at
the historic Lord Mayor's banquet, held
to-night, made a strong plea, for peace
and arbitration on behalf of the Brit
ish Goveratnent. Lord Lansdown*
pointed out to a large audience that
arbitration was the only way In which
the North Sea dispute with Russia
could have been equitably settled, and
(utnost in the same breath drew a
vivid picture of the horrors of the
etrusgle now proceeding in the Far
llasi. Between the lines of his speech
the Foreign Minister made an urgent
plea* amounting almost to a demand,
that the Russo-Japanese quarrel might
be settled by arbitration. It was a
carefully prepared statement made be
fore what is conceded the most repre
sentative gathering of leading men of
Great Britain, and what is generally
interpreted a bolder bid for interven
tion than has yet emanated from any
neutral power. America was writ large
in this speech, for which Great Britain
has been waiting for many days.
The Foreign Minister prefaced all his
remarks by saying:
"That great statesman, John Hay,
recently remarked that war was the
most futile and fallacious of human
follies."

PORTLAND, Nov. 9.â The OreKonian
will to-morrow make an announcement
affecting the jobbing interests of San
Francisco and Salt Lake merchants in
competition with Portland dealers. It
is to the effect that on December 1
the Oregon Railroad and Navigation
Company will put into operation re
duced . rates between Portland and
Southern Idaho points, ransrinic from
9 to 48 cents a hundred pounds, accord
ing to the class of goods shipped.
This rate will put the Portland mer
chants on a parity with San Francis
co and Salt Lake merchants, who for
four years have been granted rates to
Southern Idaho points' which have
made them dominate in that country.
San Francisco shippers were srranted
rates permitting them to ship into
Idaho cheaper than the Portland mer
chant could import goods v from that
city and reship to Idaho from this
point.

"The expert specialist (the physician

can beat Britt if allowed to weigh 134
pounds does not help to make the re
cent meeting of the men look good.
Gans probably expects to' be allowed to
carry that extra pound weight in his
glove and not on his body.
The joke about the show of Britt and
Gans seems too good to keep and hints
are being dropped right and left by
persons who were interested in it as to
the manner in which the public was
duped. Letters which are passing be
tween this city and the East are sure
.to be made public some day and then
the guilty ones will be shown up.
Gans told a reputable sporting man
of this city the morning after the 3how
that he could beat Britt If he (Gans)
had one hand tied behind him. Why he
did not do so could 'probably be an
swered by Al. Herford, who is home
ward bound, weighted down with Cali
fornia gold.
Joe Gans still retains the title of lightweight
champion of the world, but there -are, I lm
ajtine. a great many more to-day who are of
the opinion that his hitherto undisputed right
to the title was badly punctured on Monday
nisht by Jimmy Britt. There can be no dis
puting the fact that while the fight lasted
It waa Brltt's by a big margin, but, while
this la undoubtedly true, did the negro fight
his fight, and is his disgraceful showing with
Britt to be taken as his true form, or will we
have to throw that performance out and go
back to his previous performances In the ring?
I believe the flrht terminated exactly as
scheduled. I believe the whole thing was
fixed when the match was made -to end as It Â¦
did. I believe the club and referee were In on
the deal as much as the fighters were, and I
further believe the money was equally di
vided, i
Everybody who knows Gans knows that he
did not fight anywhere near his form. It waa
not within measuring distance of I his fight,
according to past performances. He was, ac
cording to the telegraphic report of the battle,
repeatedly knocked down by rights and lefts,
and appeared all in after -boxing two rounds.
Britt outboxed him and outslugged him and
had him on the run 1 from start- to finish â
something no other fighter ever did.
It was no more Brltt's fight than It was
Gans'. Who ever saw Britt In any of his bat
tles open up and tear right Into an opponent
and drop him with right and left punches?
Who ever saw Britt lose his head In any of hi*
battlen to Â«uch an extent as to commit a series
of fouls', any one of which was of Â«uch gravity
to warrant the referee in disqualifying him?
Britt has always shpwn that he was cool
and collected at all stages of the fight. Con
trast his conduct in all his previous fights with
that In hlw fight with the negro Gans. The
Idea that' Britt would get so. excited -ns to
strike his opponent while on the floor after a
knockdownâ not only once, but several times â
and then, after being disqualified, tear Into
the referee and go to smashing him!
The whole thing not only looks to me like a
fake, but It really smells very loud.
The attack on Graney waa. as much a part
of the programme as was striking Gans when
he wes on the floor. The Graney-Britt mlx-up
was" for the purpose of diverting the attention
of. . the spectators from the real contest, . and
very likely helped out considerably in per
ruadlng t ho crowd that the battle was on Its
merits.
Gans Is still the lightweight champion and
Brltt's reputation as a fighter Is much better
now that It was before he met the negro. The
Gans backers won their money and everything
Is werene.
. There eeems to be nothing left* now but to
tret together again and fix up another angle
that will satisfy the next crop of "eaÂ»y marks"
who will contribute to the gate receipts. It Is
asserted that Monday night's , gate receipts
amounted to $33.000 â a pretty nice little sum
to cut up among such a swell bunch of fistic
promoters as those who engineered the Gans-
Brltt fiasco.

When the paths of "Bat" Masterson
and "Willis" Britt converge the fur will

gun are many nicks.

and while they are not as sanguinary
as those of Masterson they are more
numerous. , Masterson has laid aside
the slxshooter for the typewriter and Is
contributing some sprightly boxing
gossip to the New York Morning Tele

The Britt-Gans show with specialties

actors comes In for the severest criti
cism at his hands. He does not mince
his words, as witness the following:

Nobody has said a word about
"Kerry Patch" McLaughlln and he
has been here for several days with
hla "tack" and green gloves. Kerry
Patch was out here last year with
Barney Schrieber, but could not con
vince the Jovial Teuton that he was a
rider. McLaughlin does not look un
like BobBy Gaylor and his tenacity
was finally rewarded. He piloted sev
enty-six winners during the St. Louis
racing season and with Gil Summers
to make engagements for him may
eventually climb to_ the top rung of
the ladder.

assistants Morris McKnight and Vin

brother of Arthur McKnight, is one
of the most capable men in hin line
of business and is popular with own

and snappy all the time, and some
pretty plays were made. Wheeler got
away with several mean chances, and
both Van Buren and Freeman ate up
all kinds of kinky ones that were toss
ed toward the first cushion. The Seals
had a chance to win out in the eichth,
when Gorton hit. He tried to go down
to second after Smith juggled and was
thrown out. The score:
San Francisco â I Seattle â
The weather was about the right
temperature for a pitcher when time
was called, and therefc-re both Corbett
and Williams had almost everything
stewed away. The batters were help
less on each side. Five times did the
tiiwashes ride on Joe's offerings. The
Seals could r.ot get a hit for six
innings. Waldron broke in with a
Texas Leapuer in the seventh. Gorton
bit off a clean one in the eighth.
Corbett used a slow ball with a big
curve mc-stly, and it was an awful
puzzler to the Slwashes. He had per
fect control, and passed only one man.
Williams walked three, but his bases
on balls did not coun^ for he always
had the next batter on his staff. The
Si washes pave Williams perfect sup
port, while Wheeler and Irwin com
mitted the only â¢-Â¦ miscues counted
against the Seals.
The work vf the inneldcrs was fast
Had the smoky masses' and the fog
pyramids kept away from Recreation
Park for a few minutes longer yester
day afternoon there might have been
a winner named. But it was not to
be. and after the Seals and the Si
washes labored for nine innings with
out sending a man across the pan Um
pire Jim McDonald broke the news to
the fans and they went away com
menting on what might have been.
As far as pitchers' "battles go the
game was about the real McCoy; but
outside the work of the rival slab
sters there was nothing much to see.
A straggling hit happened every few
innings, but the base runner invari
ably died on his bug, although each
team had numerous chances to break
un the pame.
Sixty-four of the greatest greyhounds
in America were drawn last night to
compete for the John Grace Challenga
Cup at Union Coursing Park on Satur
day and Sunday. This stake is the
greatest coursing event in the country
and never before in the history of the
sport has such a grand aggregation of
hounds been brought together.
The total prize money to be divided is
13300. The first round of the stake will
be run on Saturday. The big stake
consists of sixty-four entries. The
thirty-two beaten dogs will then meet
in the "purse" stake. The sixteen
beaten dogs in this event will run in
the "plate." Under this arrangement
all but six dogs will earn their entrance
money.
A special train will leave Third and
Townsend streets on Saturday morning
at 11 o'clock. On Sunday special trains
will leave at 10:13, 12:30 and 1:13. The
first round of the big stake and possi
bly the purse event will be run down on
Saturday. The balance of the card will
be completed on Sunday. Inglesida
park will be closed during this meeting.

It was a day of "good things," begin
ning with Bank, trained by Regan,
and ending with Alleumeur, trained by
T. J. Healey. The victory of Zeala
helped the bookmakers because most of
the shrewd ones argued that as she is a
full sister to Waterboy, she is not a
mudder. This notion was dispelled to
a great extent, for, though the favorite,
Trapper, ran her to a head and was
undoubtedly gaining on her all
through the last furlong, Zeala had
plenty of early speed. Trapper came
from six lengths behind Zeala and
really ran a better race than she did.
The only stake of the day was the
Stonybrook, which was won by "Char
ley" Fox's Go Between, by a few
inches. It was a clear case of the sec
ond best horse winning, as Lord Badge
had the race in hand. If Travers had
ridden with a little more vigor he
would have saved. the race for Oliver's
horse. Summary:

STA>U!Xa OF THE CX.UBS,
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 9.â
The last secret practice of the year
closed to-night, and to-morrow after
noon the varsity football team will go
through an open practice before the
whole student body c-f the university.
Then for the first time the public will
know how this year's team compares
with thoae of former years. Line-buck
ing and ground-gaining ability cannot
be told from mere signal practice, but
with new formations getting off In
rapid succession the Stanford eleven
ought to be able to make good gains
on next Saturday. Friday the team
will be given a complete rest, but will
not be left to their own amusements.
A 'bus will take them up into the
mountains, where they will be given
a gc-od dinner and returned to the
campus in the evening. To-morrow's
open practice will be a sort of rally for
the rooters. The band will be out and
the enthusiasm of 1000 studeifys will,
have full sway.
To the delight of Coach Lanagan the
heavy scrimmage work of the past two
evenings has nut resulted In one seri
ous injury. Every man seems to be in
perfect trim, and the fear that there
would be a slump this week has entire
ly passed away. There will probably
be no changes in the line-up, although
either West or Stanford may beat
Smith out for end at tne last minute.
Right end will be a ticklish position on
the Stanford team in- the intercollegi
ate game, for It is around that point
that the fast Snedigar is counted upon
to make great gains. Coach Lanagan,
in anticipation of this, has spent a
great deal of time in teaching the four
candidates for that position. While the
place is still open, tnere is so little
choice between the men that the se
lection of any one will not weaken the
team.
â¢'The style of play that will be used
in the intercollegiate contest is a secret
which neither the coaches nor the men
will give out. It is probable, how
ever, that little else than straight line
bucking football tactics will be used.
Line bucking seems the strong fea
ture of the cardinal eleven, and it
will take a strong team to withstand
the incessant poundings of Weller,
Dole and Chalmers. The two tackles,
Sprott and Shields, will be counted on
to carry the ball for gains.
Sprott will kick off for Stanforckand
will kick the goals if the cardinal
eleven is fortunate enough to push the
ball over for a touchdown. Dole, while
not the equal of Heitmuller in practice,
wilt do all the punting. He may be
counted on for a drop kick or two if
the ball gets down to the thirty-yard
line. Although Dole is not a great
punter in practice, he has a peculiar
habit of improving wonderfully in a
contest, and averages at least ten
yards farther than at other times.
Barring rain the California field
should prove favorable to the Stanford
eleven. Trained all year on a soft,
sawdust gridiron, the cardinal will be
unusually fast on the hard ground at
Berkeley. The men are so well train
ed that the hard surface is not likely
to Injure them. Rain v/ould favor
neither team, while it would slow up
the game considerably.
Union Coursing Park Will
Be Scene of Great Sport
on Saturday and Sunday
Howard, at end, will probably be all
right for the game, despite his attack
of measles last Saturday. He is out,
but has not done any practice work
since Saturday.
Yell Leader Bulkeley and his cohorts
promise some of. the finest exhibitions
of yelling and chorus singing ever
heard at an intercollegiate game. Blue
and gold megaphones for all rooters
will "help some," and blue and gold
bands on the sleeve of each rooter will
provide additional color.' There will be
new yells and songs, calculated to cheer
the blue and gold men on to victory.
Sperry, the freshman, may have to
be taken from full because of the injur
ies to the halves, and put back at half,
leaving Lasater to play the fullback
position alone.
BERKELEY, Nov. 9.â Hard luck
seems to have perched on the banners
of the blue and gold football team this
year. Accidents to players are coming
so thick and fast that no man is able
to tell with just what measure of
strength California will go into the
game with Stanford on Saturday.
Ned White, right halfback, sprained
his ankle so badly last night that he
was not able to take part in the prac
tice to-day, and he may not be able to
play at all. Kerr, the big freshman
who made such a good showing in the
freshman game, injured his hip Mon
daj>-in a scrimmage, and he, too, did
not take part in the practice work last
night or to-day. Stern is kept out of
the line-up by measles. Gray and
O'Toole were Â£he only ones left to line
up in the guard positions today.
Snedigar, the veteran" halfback star
of the team, wrenched his knee last
night. He injured the same member
early In the season, but had recovered,
apparently, and rounded to in good
shape. This recent injury is' causing
the coaches more worry than any other
feature of the team's condition^
Mead, halfback, has been playing
with splints on his hands, while Whit
man, who was a candidate for quarter,
has finally had to take to crutches. He
is completely out of-it.

Wheeling, W. Va., May 28, 1903.
Some years ago trhile at work, I fell
over a truck and severely injured both
of ray shins. My blood became poisoned
as a result, and the doctor told me I
would have running sores for life, and
that if they were healed up the result
would be fataL Under this discouraging
report I left off their treatment and re-
eorted to the use of S. S. S. Its effects
Â¦were proaipt and gratifying. It took
only a short while for the "medicine to en-
tirely cure up the sores, and I am not
dead as the doctors intimated, nor have
the sores ever broke out again. Some 12
years have elapsed since what I have de-
scribed occurred. Having been 60 signally
benefittedbyitsuse I can heartily recom-
mend it as the one great blood purifier.

Chronic sores start often from a pim-
ple, scratchy bruise or boil, and while
salves, washes and powders are beneficial,
the unhealthy matter in the blood must
be driven out or the sore will continue
to eat and spread. S. S. S. reaches
.these old sores through the blood, re-
moves all impurities and poisons, builds
up the~ entire system and strengthens

MAKES MAD JUMP OVER
ROCKS AT THE CIrfFF
SANTA ROSA, Nov. 9.â While es
corting two prisoners whom he had
arrested at Kenwood to the County
JaiU this morning. Sheriff Frank F.
Grace found himself in an unusual pre
dicament. He was forced to look down
the muzzle of a rifle in the hands of
one of his prisoners, and listen to the
demands of the men for his money and
a revolver which they knew the Sheriff
carried. - v Â¦Â¦ 'Â¦' Â¦
Last nigrht a saloon on' the Sonoma
road near this city was robbed, and
William Cameron and Charles j Cor
men were wanted for the crime. Grace
went to Kenwood on the mornintr
Southern Pacific train and at that
place the youthful culprits attempted to
board the train. '. In order to take the
boys to the saloon they had robbed
for identification, Grace hired a vehicle
and driver to return to this city. 'When
near the city limits Grace permitted
Cormen to alight momentarily from
the vehicle and the prisoner took ad
vantage of the opportunity to run.
Grace fired three shots Â»in the air "to
frighten- the culprit, and then jumped
to the ground in pursuit of the pris
oner, leaving the second man in the
wagon with the driver. The Other
prisoner picked up a rifle which had
been taken from him and which lav
on the bottom of the vehicle and started
in pursuit of the prisoner. .
When Sheriff Grace came up the
creek bank without the first prisoner
who escaped, he looked Into the muzzle
of the rifle held in the hands of his
prisoner. He was dumf ounded ; and
argued with the prisoner, asklne him
to lower the gun. Finally in fancied
security Cameron started to walk
away, when William Murphy and John
Underhlll came -to the scene attracted
by the shots flred by the Sheriff. See
ing he was pursued Cameron flred two
shots at. Sheriff Grace ,and one each
at the other men. ainrphy returned

Supervisors' Street Committee Agrees*
on .Method to Improve Street
Railway Service.
The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday referred to the City Attor
ney all the questions raised by E.IP.
E. Troy as tb the alleged forfeiture of
franchises on various streets by the
United Railroads owing to non-user
in order to have the matter legally
determined by the courts if. that
course is deemed necessary-
The 2 committee decided that it
would be necessary to pass ordinances
covering the many reforms which
Troy desires to Introduce in the ser
vice of the street railways. Troy
wanted regulations as to speed and
the installation of proper life guards
on cars to prevent frequent accidents.
Troy agreed to prepare an ordi
nance requiring the cars to be cleaned
periodically as a sanitary precaution
and the committee will take It under
consideration.
The proposed ordinance making it
unlawful for any person operating an
automobile to drain oil from the
crank case or gear case of the ma
chine on the public streets was taken
under advisement.
The committee reported in favor of
an ordinance prohibiting the distribu
tion of. circulars or books containing
immoral or obscene literature.

PRESCOTT, Ariz., Nov. 9. â James P.
Storm, County Treasurer of this coun
ty, was found locked in the steel vault
of his office, bound and gagged. Fif
teen thousand dollars is missing from
the cash funds of the treasury. Storm
had been in the vault sixteen hours
when found this morning by his daugh
ter. He says that about 4 o'clock yes
terday afternoon, while he was seated
in his office, two men entered the door
with handkerchiefs tied over their
faces. One of them pointed a revolver
at his head and ordered him to throw
up his hands. Storm complied, and the
two men closed the door of the office
and produced a string of baling wire,
with which they securely bound his
feet " and hands. They forced a hand
kerchief into his mouth and pushed
him inside the vault.
After gathering up $15,000 and leis
urely ransacking the office for more
money, the men closed the door of the
vault, locked the office and departed.
Being a holiday, there were few peo
ple around the Courthouse, and no one
witnessed the hold-up. Storm was so
securely bound that he, was unable to
release himself, and remained in the
vault until 10 o'clocK this morning,
when his daughter came to the office
and discovered it locked. Her father's
absence from home the night previous
had not occasioned any alarm by rea
son of its being election night, his fam
ily concluding that he had remained
away to hear the election returns.
After assistance had been summoned
the office was opened and the vault
door unlocked. Storm was found,
still bound and gagged, on the floor
of the vault, almost In a state of nerv
ous prostration. The wire with which
his hands and feet had been securely
bound had cut him severely.
He was unable to give any accurate
description of the men who held him
up, excepting that one was a' tall and
the other a short man. They both ap
peared very cool and nervy and were
evidently old hands at the business.
The robbery has caused great excite
ment here, and officers are searching
vigorously for some clew to the men
Mho did the work. Owing to the fact
that the officers have no description to
work upon and the bandits had over
sixteen hours in which to make their
escape before Storm was discovered in
the vault, it is extremely unlikely that
they will be apprehended.
Sheriff's Posse Is Organized
for Pursuit, but Descrip
tion of Men Is Very Meager

"HE SEES" objects (outlines) at 30 feet;
eyes "blind" 7 years (1 treatment Tuesday).
"REXRADIO'S" 1 treatment entirely removed
my "dropsy" and straightened limb.
"SUICIDE" avoided; protracted disease ren-
dered life a burden; orten thought of sui-
cide, after spending largely, vainly, for re-
lief; then Rexradlo made quick, complete
cure, months ago; no RELAPSE.
"REXRADIO" rescued me quickly from thÂ»
fiery purgatory of "neuralgia."
"ANCHYLOSIS of Joints, knees, ankles/ hips,
toes, fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck,
etc., which others deem 'Incurable,' have
often yielded to Rexradlo's very first treat-
ment' " Testimonials shown.
"PAINS" of all kinds (neuralgia, sciatica,
rheumatism, gout, etc.) usually have been
expelled by Rexradlo's "first" treatment.
Proofs â Numerous testimonials.
"RESURRECTION" excepted. BROKER, one
of our leading cltUens, recently (publicly)
said: "I have seen Rexradlo do nearly In-
credible healing wonders In my office. I
verily believe he can do almost anything but
RAISE THE DEAD. I am ready to put up
my money on It"
"$1000 FORFEIT" if above digests ui vases are
not "genuine." Stacks of testimonials.
"NOTE THIS" â Names of all above patients
given at offices to persons similarly afflicted;
we object to "publication" of their nameÂ«.
Above "digests" of cases 1 refer to results of
"first" treatment, which benefits usually be-
come perfect and permanent ' after a few
"further" treatments.
"REXRADIO" can and does PO ALL HE
CLAIMS TO DO. HE FEARLESSLY CHAL-
LENGES COURTEOUS (CRUCIAL) INVES-
TIGATION.
"CONSULTATION" given free. TERMS for
treatment to suit circumstances.
"PUBLIC HEALING" before audiences free to
poor TO-DAY, 2 and 8 p. m. Rexradlo also
publicly gives every one In audience deelrlng
It a "sample" of his peculiar healing power.

Money, Stocks and Business.
TUÂ« New York circular of Henry Clews eays:
â¢â¢AÂ» to the future, of the market, granting
tv!l that has been claimed regarding the effects
cÂ£ a proStabie harvest, of business lmprov*.
tcer.t, of etÂ£.y money, of increased railroad
â¢areings and other 'avorable features, such as
the activity In iron and copper, it must be
recognized that thtse have bten amply diÂ»
eour.ied. On their merits the majority of
sjood etocks are really high enough, tome in
Strt are tco high, and bargains arÂ« scarce. If
Bet entirely absent. At the tame ucie the
speculative epirit has been thoroughly aroused
%r.i is being ekil'fully nursed by those who
â¢till have ttocks In plenty to sell. The big
banking houses are alp.o Interested In prevent
tr^r any serious detllne. There is an excellent
investment demand for good securities, demon
etratcd by the rapid absorption of recent bond
ltrues and affording b&ckere a desirable op
portunity for carrying out long deferred plans.
The next iew weeks may consequently witness
the Sotatlca of a number of new Issues It
conditions continue favorable, eo that the op
erations of our leading financiers naturally
daice them as much averse to any Important
reaction as to any rampant speculation. Tb*
: . . â¢â¢: thus seem* in an exceptionally satis
factory condition, havlcg the double advantage
of national prosperity and the restraining
Tower of powerful bankers who are more vi
tally interested :n legitimate and euccesgful
-national '.-.â¢.,:â¢â¢:.â¢. than in hazardous specu
lative enterprises.
THE OUTLOOK.
"Some uneasiness was caused by tbe re
t-ews.1 of gold sUp-sents. Â£o far ** the. actual
Joxf of thr metal is concerned there Is no cause
for anxiety. Our present stock is unusually
large and we produce about fSO.OOO.WO an
touaiiy. to Â«*y nothing of receipts from the
Klondike and Australia. The worst that could
fce anticipated would be a temporary reduc
tion of the bank reserves and a hardening of
turner rates, the latter contingency one that
would not meet with much ciifcapproval In
conservative backing circles. There Is an
other view, however, of eo unusual a move
Â«r*?nt at this season, when the supply of pro
duce bills c-og-ht to be large enough to pre
vtct gold ehipmenta. and that Is the strain
Imposed upon the Paris and Berlin money
ir.arkets by the Iiussian war loan. Paris is al
rÂ«Jt<?y loaded up to the trim with Russian
kor.ds and extraordinary measures have been
Sr.ade to prevent panic there in case of Uus
Â¦#ian defeat. Government regulations now
trohlbit luture or short sales la order to pre
*fr.t a decline, but this operation may easily
rrove an element of weakness Inasmuch as
-ere will be no purchases on the short account
to surport the market la case of a break. The
trrt-.ga situation 1* one th&t requires close
ioT ' whlle OUr own *narket is in
fnnG shape, a cri*>l!< on the European bourtws
â¢^Â¦Mi.iJ certaialy have an Injurious Influence
"The rros-pects are for an active and lr-
J'^.w market, with possibly wide fluctua-
BOM I11^Â« r , Pf-cts may prevail before the
t->P :s reached, but values are already on a
Jr.rreanng. A cumber of large traders havÂ«
â¢old out and beccm* bear, for the time being
h-nce a division of opinion occurs which works
for !rrfcrular:ty and more active trading T'n-
Xsvorab.e bank statements and somewhat
f.m.er money rates have b~n looked for

The car of Cranberries that arrived from
Cape Cod several days ago Is already almost
all sold, and the market for this fruit Is re
ported very firm at an advance, with rising
Eastern markets. Apples continue to roll In
from outside points, and there were liberal re
ceipts of the homo grown article yesterday.
Trade was reported brisk In fancy stock, while
the lower grades were neglected. Christmas
Apples were offering at $2 50 per box, but found
few buyers. Grapes did better under decreased
receipts and a brisk shipping demand. Early
arrivals of Strawberries and Raspberries
cleaned up promptly at steady prices. Re
ceipts of the Mallnda variety from WatsonvlUe
came to hand too late for the regular trade, I
and a good portion of them were turned over !
to peddlers at the Inside quotation. Receipts '
of Oranges consisted of several carloads and
numerous small shipments. Trade was fair In j
well colored stock, but owing to the Increased
receipts prices were lowered. . Lemons were
firm, with the market almost -bare of fancy
stock. Tbe other fruits had no change worthy {
of note. â¢ j

Receipts of Eggs were larger than of late,

small. Prices show no change and the situa

Receipts were 55,900 lbs Butter, 945 cases
Eggs and 35,800 lbs^Wf?ese.
There was no particular change in Butter or
Eggs yesterday, though the top quotation for
Butter was shaded a. fraction. The market
was still oversupplled with creamery, fancy as
to brand, but which has deteriorated through
lying on the floorc some days, and these goods
tend to weaken fine fresh arrival* Overloaded

Harrison's circular nays: "Since the steam
ship Ventura left there have been but three
arrivals of Australian coal from Newcastle,
namely: Brenn, 293C tons: Emma Laurani*.
2S17 tens; Lady Doris. 3000 tons; total. 8773
ton?. Notwithstanding the apparent liberal ar
rivals for October, which footed up In all 23.719
tone, the quantity received In October, 1903,
was more than double this amount, being
47.967 tons. Yet for the moment there is 1 a
bounteous supply for immediate requirements.
There are seventeen vessels (eleven now en
route, which arÂ« on the chartered list .from Aus
tralia to this port: they will carry In all about
45.C00 tons. But few names are being added
to the engaged list, as shippers are not pre
pared to pay the present asking rates. The re
sult Is shipments of colonial coal are gradually
diminishing. Shipments* from our coaÂ« collier
ies are coming forward freely and are finding
ready sale on arrival. Shippers are enabled
to put their colliery output into this market
at a pretty low figure, as carriers are procur
able for tranrÂ»portlng same at reduced rates.
Trade generally in this line Is showing an im
provement, as, the volume of trade at this sea
son of tho y*Â»ar always enlarges. There is no
perceptible change in values asked by either
the wholesale or retail dealers. Fuel oil still
holds Its sway as a steam producer, the price
li> low and the demand Is large. There appears
to be next to no limit of the quantity offered
for sale."

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. Â».â TTje election stock
market resembled tbe election itself. In the
fact that it offered small. chance for diminu
tion* and contrasts. The strength of the mar
ket became general and well distributed and
the dealings rose to a larger aggregate than
for any day since the panic, on May 9, 1901.
There was a heavy outpouring of stocks during
tbe fli-st hour by those who had bought in
thÂ« past In anticipation of the larger de
mand that would follow the election, and
tbe market " reacted to near Monday's close.
In the last hour there weÂ« the usual disposi
tion to realise profits on the considerable ad
vances of the day. But these movements did
not at all obscure the broadened demand for
securities, and the speculative strength dis
played by the market. Another change was
in the temper of the later speculation a*
compared with the opening. The most feverish
movements, at flret. were among the Indus
trials, some of the low .grade issues being con
â¢X>iouou*>, and they suffered moet materially
in the realizing of the first hour. After that
they did not 'return to their first prominence.
The opening rush in the securities of this
cJasc vru in pursuance of the campaign in
augurated late last week in them, on the as
sumption that the revived speculation after
the election would turn Into new channels.
But the demand which poured into the mar
ket to-day teems nut to be Inclined to rush
into all grades of securities without discrim
ination and without regard to the earning
power. The later market showed notable dl
vrrvion of demand to established dividend
rayers and to standard railroad stocks. The
L'nited States t-teel stocks were not exempt
from this tendency, and their opening prices
proved to be the highest of the day. Southern
Paclflc, Reading. Rock Island and Erie became
aggressive leaders of the late movement in
the railroad list. There was no specific new*
to account for their strength. The day's newb
was very little regarded outside the election,
and there was not much of it of importance.
Tbe money market was unaffected by the ar
rangements for further gold shipments to Cuba,
the recession to par of New York exchange
at Chicago, requirements for the revival In'
speculation, the announcement of the placing
here of a part of a Japanese lean of
$00,000,000. and the intimation that Govern
ment deposits to the extent of $20,000,000 will
probably bÂ« drawn from the banks about De
cember 1. StÂ»rllng exchange was steady, but
the Imperial Bank of Germany made a good
return, -sterling rising at Berlin. The price
of gold was n'.arked down in London and the
impression was created that an advance in
the Bank of England discount rate will be
avoided to-morrow. The stock market closed
irregular and below best prices.
The bond market was very strong, but the
largest dealing* were in convertible Interest
bearing lesuee. Total sale* (par vaiue),- $14,

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Nov. 9.â A sharp advance in
grain prices at Liverpool influenced the wheat
pit here at the opening. Early reports indi
cated'that wet weather had prevailed in Ar
' gentlna. Advices from that country, however,
stated that the weather was improving. As a
partial result of this dental sentiment In the
pit soon became more bearish. Reports of rain
In the Southwest were an additional Incentive
to sell. The market also was influenced, in a
large degree, by the bull crowd. Under the
selling pressure December declined to $1 1214
and May $1 1194- Toward the end of the ses
sion, however, sentiment again became bullish,
largely as a result of the extreme strength of
the late corn market. The market closed
strone, final quotations on December being at
$1 13%. May closed at $1 12%.
An active demand from shorts caused an ad
vance, of over 2%c in the price of December
corn. The market closed practically at the
highest point. December dosed at 51%Â©51^k>.
Strength of other grains had a buoyant effect
on the price of oats. December closed at the

Board of Education Wants Supervis
ors Forced to Submit Proposed
School Amendments.
Attorney Stephen Costello, acting in
behalf of the Board of Education,
filed a petition for a writ of mandate
at the Supreme Court yesterday ask
ing that the Board of Supervisors be
compelled to call a special election on
the proposed school amendments. The
Supervisors have declined to act in
the matter on the ground that there
were no funds available, but the
Board of Education claims that the
election is necessary in view of the
formal issuance of the call for it sev
eral weeks asro.
Although the Supreme Court sus
tained the Election Commission in its
refusal to place the amendments on
the ballot at the general election,
there is some doubt in the minds of
the city's legal lights about the right
of the Supervisors to hold that the in
cident was thus closed.

Prince Sadanaru of the house of
Fushimi herS\ yesterday from
Jaj.rn on the steamship Manchuria and
was accorded a reception- befitting his
rank as a nobleman of the spunky lit
tle nation that has opened the eyes of
the world in demonstrating military
and naval skill in its war with Russia.
The' Manchuria was met Â»at the en
trance to the harbor by the revenue
tug Golden Gate, and. by the courtesy
of the Treasury Department, the Prince
was permitted to leave the inbound
liner without the ceremony of "inspec
tion," and. with his attendants, he was
landed several minutes later at Wash
ington street dock. /
The Prince comes as a messenger, so
to ppeak, from the Emperor of Japan
to President Roosevelt. He was cor
dial to the representatives of the Gov
ernment and the reception, committee
that were on board the Golden Gate. to
offer him the hospitality of not only
San Francisco, but the United States.
The Manchuria anchored off Melggs
wharf about 10 o'clock in' the morning,
and a few minutes later the tug went
alongside. Those - who were - on â¢ the
Golden Gate were William B. Hamil
ton, Hart H. , North, Commissioner of
Immigration;'' Charles Al Stephens^ W.
D. Wightman and Harry Moffltt. The
Japanese residents of thls^city were
represented t by Japanese Consul K.
Myeno, S. Skatsuka, Secretary of the
Japanese legation at Washington, T.
MIkimoto, manager, of the . Nutsui
Bussan Company, and K. Ito, manager
of the Toyo Steamship Company.
D. S. Richardson, foreign secretary of
the consulate of Japan, was | with A.
Oyama and J. Iwaya, assistant secre
taries of . the consulate. Another one
of the welcoming host was S. Tosawa,
manager of the Yokohama . Specie
Bank at San Francisco.
MANCHURIA ARRIVES.
When the Manchuria dropped anchor
the Golden Gate made" fast alongside,
and the reception committee followed
the Custom House Inspectors up I the
gangway. They were conducted to the
upper deck, where they were presented
to the -Prince and his party. In his
.suite are A. Sata, Minister Resident;
Count S. Terashima, Lieutenant Col
onel S. Mihara, N. Watanahe, master
of court ceremonies: S. Tokioka, of
ficer of the imperial household . de
partment; S. Miki. retainer of the
Prince, and Dr. K. Rokkaku, the
attending physician of the Prince. All
the members of the Prince's party
were dressed in the latest American
style, exceDt K. Watanahe, the master
of court ceremonies,' who wore the
morning court uniform of Japan, which
Is not unlike the uniform of an officer
in our own artillery corps. Across his
heart Watanahe wore several doeen
handsome medals. At his. side was a
beautiful saber, and .over his left arm
he carried a magnificent overcoat of
heavy brown satin, gorgeously em
broidered with the Mikado's crest.
As he walked down the gang plank
from the Manchuria to the deck of the
Golden Gate many thought him to be
the Prince.
On arrival at Washington-street dock
the Prince was received by an Immense
throng of Japanese, who saluted him
Shan. In the Japanese-Chinese war
he acted as commander of the Fourth
Regiment and was in / engagements
at both Formosa and Port Arthur. He
was educated to be a soldier.
The Prince, after dinner, . accom
panied by several members of his
suite, occupied a box at the Tlvoli.
Vy'hile his imperial Highness was not
conversant wjth the argument of the 1
libretto, he greatly enjoyed the music
and-funny situations in "The Messen
ger Boy" and applauded . heartily
throughout the performance.
with modulated shouts of . welcome.
Here a reception committee composed
of twenty local leading Japanese mer
chants in frock cqg^Â£ t silk hats and
white gloves formeu a sort of hollow
square at the end'of the wharf. A large
proportion of the Japanese population
of the city was lined up at either side
of the long dock. The Prince was con
ducted to a handsonie open carriage
and escorted by the reception commit
tee to the St. Francis Hotel, â¢ where
another delegation of Japanese was at
hand to offer him. su hearty welcome.
He retired immediately to his apart
ments, which consist of the entire
southern second floor of the hotel. -
In honor of the visitors the hotel "has
been beautifully decorated. Massive
Jars and urns of priceless value deco
rate . the grand salon. The stairway
and halls leading to the Prince's apart
ments are appropriately ornamented.
DRIVES IN PARK.
Shortly after luncheon the Prince,
with several of his suite, took a drive
through the park. He dined in his own
apartments. He will leave this morn
ing at 10 o'clock for Washington. ;
In. speaking of his visit to this coun
try the Prince said: "I come here with
messages of friendship from the Em
peror of Japan to the President of the
United States. As the .representative
of my country, I shall deliver these
messages to President. Roosevelt. After
this I shall return by way of. St. Louis.
I am very anxious to see your wonder
ful World's Fair, of whibh I have heard
so much. -^ Â¦
"I am particularly interested in arts
and. sciences and these I shall study
with especial interest, it is twenty
years since I have been in your coun
try. Already I note the marvelous
changes that have taken place in your
magnificent city since that time. I shall

the Mongolia, which. leaves here for; the
Orient on December 28. - I . hope to
spend a few. days in-your oity at that
time, when I shall try to take in all the
many points of interest abouthere."
The Prince does not speak' English,
but Is a scholar of French. In appear

Judge Hebbard yesterday granted a
divorce to May Mott-Smith Bird, artist
and one of the owners of the Mott-
Smith estate in the Hawaiian Islands,
from John E. Bird, who deserted her
because her family would not let him
handle her finances. The affidavit of
the wife's .brother, Ernest A. Mott-
Smith, a lawyer of Honolulu and man
ager of the estate, was read. Bird is
in Norwood, Massachusetts. When he
married the heiress in Boston in 1898,
the book value of her wealth was
$88,742 64, but the brother says that in
reality it was only about $60,000 be
cause of the depreciation of securities
held by the estate, which had not been
charged off the books. At the present
time- the books show her to jbe worth
$73,539, but the real fortune, accord
ing to the brother, is about $31,000, and
Mrs. Bird's sole support Is her Income
from this and her .earnings as a de
signer of antique jewelry In this fity.
Bird was working on the Boston
Herald for $20 a week and said that his
wife caused him to lose his position.
After that he would not accept a posi
tion, that was not in keeping with his
pride. In consequence he did nothing
but speculate with his wife's money.
When the Mott-Smith heirs were pre
paring to incorporate the estate Bird
opposed and said that he was going to
manage his wife's property himself.
However they i incorporated and the
estate is worth more than $300,000.
WORK IX ISLANDS.
In 1900 the proud husband was in
duced to go to Honolulu and was prom
ised a Dosition as clerk and book
keeper for the estate. Mr. Mott-Smith,
however, .found It advisable to retain
his old bookkeeper and made Bird
auditor. He was also paid to write re
ports of the plantations owned by the
estate on several of the islands, but,
according to Mr. Mott-Smith. these re
ports were of {lttle value and Bird de- (
voted his trips to pleasure and so
ciety.
In August, 1909, says the deposition.
Mrs. Bird followed her husband to the
islands and three days later Bird told
his brother-in-law that 'they had some
differences which Mott-Smith was ask
ed to adjudicate. He declined to in
terfere in family troubles and selected
lawyers for Bird and his wife. No
settlement was reached, and three
weeks later Bird sailed for home. Prior
to that time, Mott-Smith offered to set
him up in business, but his enterprises
came to nothing. "He shrank from be
ginnings," said the depondent. Refer
ring to Bird's relations with his wife,
the brother said: "His affection for
her bore the ear-marks. of spasmodic
infatuation, rather than sincerity. His
disposition darkened her natural buoy
ancy."
Divorces were . granted yesterday by
Judge Graham to Anna M. Lingerf elder
from George F. Lingenf elder, a Union
Iron Works employe, for cruelty; by
Judge Hebbard to Edith M. Christen
sen from Peter N. Christensen. deser

Attorney for the Accused

to Errors in Bookkeeping*
Cress Ungrr, who for more than a
Quarter of a century has befii con
nected with the United States Customs
service In various rapacities, and
against whom vlie finger of suspicion
has been pointed during his service as
seizure clerk, was yesterday afternoon
arrested on a ci;arse of embezzlement.
Without suffering the ignominy of
being confined in & prison*;ell he was
held In the United States Marshal's of
fice until his bondsmen arrived, rrhen
he was taken before Commissioner
Heacock and released after his bonds
men had qualified.
The amounts he is specifically ac
cused of 6iealir:Â£: are small, but the
District Attorney 1 !" office says these
cha rfces are mtuie merely to hold him
and others may be pressed if necessary.
There are two counts agrainst him. The
first charges that on March 17. 1P04.
in violation cf the laws of Congress,
he stole certain property valued at
SI9 2$; the second count accuses him
of having on ilarch 22 stolen property
valued at $36 53. The words of the ac
cusation in both cases are identical,
with the exception of the dates and
amounts. It is as follows:
Tliit CroÂ«a Cr.ccr. Jn violation of an act
of Oon*reÂ« approved March 3. 1S75. at the
City and Count* or San Francisco in tb<Â» State
*cd Northern iJirtr'.ct of California, did

iously. Â«<teaJ. puricun ar.d carry away certain
moaÂ«y and pro;Â«rty to wit: the sum of $ld 28
of the monojrE, r r -ods and chattels of the
ITslted Slate*.
Unger wap arrested at his home, 1614
Fell street, by Deputy United States
Marshal Georue H. Buixham. He took
his arrest calmly and said that he had
Intended giving himself up. He asked
for time to procure bondsmen, which
Â¦was granted- The bond was fixed at
$5000 and T. E. Coghlan. Unger's broth
er-in-law, and Harry Corbett acted as
Bureties.
V.Tiile awaiting the arrival of his
bondsmen Unger was nervous ajid re
fused to make any statement. He
eeeined confident that he would be
cieared of the charge, but did not care
to discuss details.
Kis attorney, Bert Schlesinger, was
equally uncommunicative. "I have not
had time to discuss the case with my
client yet." he said, "and accordingly
cannot enter into details. All we can
cay is thax there were errors or irregu
larities in bookkeeping s.nd as soon as
these were discovered the amount was
promptly made good. The Government
has lost nothing, and I am sure Unger
has not been guilty cf any Intentional
wrong doing."
The small amount of money alleged
to have been stolen by Ur.ger Â¦will not
protect him fro:r. punishment in case
of conviction, as tee act of Congress
under which he will be prosecuted
makes no distinction regarding
amounts. The penalty is fixed at im
prisonment at hard labor for a period
not exceeding five years cr a fine not
exceeding $5000, or both such fine and
imprisonment, at the discretion of the
court.
Attorney Schlesinger expressed sur
prise at the arrost of Unger and shows
a letter from Collector Stratton to
T'nger. dated November 9. in which
Ur.ger is informed that certain charges
have been made against him and he is
requested to appear before the collector
on November 12 and show cause why
he should not be dismissed. .^.
The case will come up for preliminary
bearing before Judge Heacock Novem
ber 19 at lu o'clock in the morning.

'Of a cough, especially of infants
zrA delicate children. Don't wait
until the ccugh becomes hard, the
throat inflamed and the lungs and
bronchial passages congested.
Avoid cough remedies that contain
opiates, stupefying drugs and dan-
gerous anodynes. They only
quiet the symptomsâ drug the
cough into silence â but that is not
curing. A weak place is left to
cause trouble later. A remedy
must be used to subdue the in-
flammation, stimulate the secre-
tions, soothe and heal the irri-
tsted membranes and cure the
cough to stay cured.
Irish Moss Cough Balsam is such
a remedy. It enjoys the indorse-
ments of many physicians, who
use it in their daily practice. Sold
