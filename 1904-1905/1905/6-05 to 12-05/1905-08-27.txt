'. Butâ Domlnlck was alone, his eternal
glass of : sarsaparilla before him.,. Ho
j used the left;corner of his mouth both '
for. his cigar and for speech. To^ bid
.me draw near and seat myself, he 'had
to shift hisrÂ»cigar. . When the few words
necessary \u25a0 were '. half -spoken, half
â¢grunted, he" rolled his cigar^back to tho
. corner which It rarely left.* He nodded
condescendingly, and, as I to.qk the in
dicated" chair at his right,. gave me a
hand. that was fat and -firm, not unlike
the .flabby -yet tenacious sucker of a
moist sea-creature. >
. He was a huge, tall man, enormously
' muscular, with a high head like a
block, straight In front, behind and on
either side; keen, shifty, pig eyes, pom
pous cheeks, a y raw, wide mouth; slov
enly dress, with a big diamond as a col
. lar. button and another on his puffy lit
' tie 'finger. > He was about'4o years old,
had graduated from blacksmith too lazy
to .work. Into prizefighter, thence into
.saloon-keeper. It was "as a saloon
keeper that he founded and built his
power,. made himself the local middle
man between our two great ' political
factors,' those who buy and break laws %
and .those who aid and abet the lawless
ness by selling themselves as voters or
'as office-holders. ,
Domlnlck had fixed his eyes upon hia
sarsaparilla. . He frowned savagely Into
its. pale brown. foam when he realized
i that I .purposed to force him to speak
i first."; His. voice was- ominously surly
aa he shifted his cigar to say: "Well,
young fellow, what can I do for you?"

I see. her now, vividly as if it were
only yesterday. We were at our scant
breakfast, I as 'blue as was ever even

hers was no mere pretense to reassure . â¢
me, no cheerless optimism of ignorance,

"I didn't find her especially friendly,

saw, a smile deep down in her oesrr
and it 'set me to thinking. ./

they ' tell me. Whenever the fellows on

offlce. who makes it : hot {or them, they
hire him. ; Good business all around."
-Thus, so suddenly that' it glddied me. I
was translated from failure to success,
from'poverty/to affluence, from the most
harassing anxiety to ease .and security.
Two months. before I should have reject
ed the' Power Trust's offer with scorn
and should :have gloried in my act as
proof *of superior virtue. But in those
crucial two months I had been appren
tice to' the master .whom all men that
ever, come to anything in this world
must first s'trve. I had reformed rrÂ»y line
of battle, had adjusted It to the lines
laid down In' the tactics of Hfe-as-it-is.
Before - 1 was able to convince myself
that my fortunes had really changed Ed
Ramsay \u25a0 me to call on. him
in Fredonla on business of his own. It
proved, to be "such a trifle that I began to
puzzle at his real reason for sending for
me. When be spun that trifle out over
ten "days, on each of which I was alono
with Carlotta at least half my waking
hours, I. thought I had the clew to the
mystery. I saw how I could Increase the
energy of his new enthusiasm for me.
and also how I could cool it if I wished
to be rash and foolish and to tempt fata
again; \u25a0â¢ . t
. "Oh, the business didn't amount to
much," was. my answer to one of my
mother's- first questions on my return.
She' smiled peculiarly. , In spite of my
efforts the red came-rat least I felt-rea.
"How did you like his sister?" she yent
en. again with that fluttering smile in
the eyes only.
"A very nice girl." said. I. in any
thing but a natural manner. My moth
er's expression teased me into adding:
"Don't be Silly. Nothing of that sort.
You are always imagining* that every
one^shares your opinion of me. She
isn't likely Jto fall in lÂ»veÂ»Â»wlth me.
Certainly I shan't with her."
Mother's silence somehow- seemed
argumentative. ,
\u25a0'\u25a0 "I* couldn't marry a girl for . her
money,'\l retorted to it.
: "Of- course not,-", rejoined - mother.
"But there are . other things to marry
for besides i- money, or love-r-other
things more sensible than -either. -For
instance, 'there are the. principal things
\u25a0 â hoirie -arid childreiÂ».'\.-": 'tt v ..^- :

"Carlo tta ; is very ambitious, said I.
"Ambitious for her husband," replied
my mother.; "as a sensible . woman
should be. -She appreciates that a wo-"
man's best chance for big divfdend3 in
marriage Is, by being the silent part
ncr in her career. She'll be
very domestic when she has children.
I saw it the instant I looked at her.
She has the true maternal instinct..
What" a man who's going to amount
to something needs isn't a woman/ to
be; taken care of. but a woman' to take
care * of ; him." ' ' \u25a0 - *
She said no moreâ she had made her
point; "and,'; when she had done ; that,
she always stopped. * I -..-..
Within a! month Ed Ramsay sent for
me again, but this.' time;, lt- was ".busi
ness alone, i: I found him -in a'panic,
like a raari facing 'an avalanche and
armed only' with a shovel. Dunkirk,
the senior United .States Senator, for
bur State, lived at Fredonia. He had
seen that, by. tunneling the Mesaba
Range' ; "a Â«\u25a0 profitable railroad between
Fredonia and Chicago could' be built
that would shorten the time at least
three hours.' - But it would take away
about, half ; v the carrying, business of
the Ramsay Company, besides seriously
depreciating the Ramsay interest in
the. existing road. "And." continued
Ed, "the old -scoundrel has got the capl
tal practically subscribed in New York;
The "people there are hot for-, the new
road. It'll. ibe sure to. carry at thÂ©
special election, next month. .He has
thÂ« Governor and. the* Legislature in
his ve/t'! pocket, so they'll put through
the charter next winter." *\u25a0"
"I don't see. that 'anythmÃ^can-be
dgjie," said Ed's lawyer,. old JJudge; Barr r
clay, whoi was at the consultation.' "It
nieans a bis rake-off, for Dunkirk. Po
litics is Zou .a money basis ' nowadays.
That's .\u25a0natural enough; since there la
money .to' bo" made out of 'It. I don't
see how, those in politics that don't
graft. '; as i they* call it, are . any better
than those that do. 'Would, they get
oflice if they ;;i dldn*t. help on. the jobs
of. the grafters? I suppose we might
buy ' Dunkirk ." off ."*,
"What" do '; you think, Harvey?" asked
Ed.' - looking anxiously at me. "We've
got ; to "fight the devil with flre, tyou
know.',' â¢' ;'.'
.: I .shook -mv head. "Buying him off
isn't 'flsrb tingâ lt's surrender. We must
fight himâ -with fire."
I let them talk themselves out. and
then said, rwell; I'll take- it to bed with
me.';. "Parhaps something â¢ will - occur *to
me that can "be worked up into a
scheme." / ;, , '. 'Â»....
In fact. ; l, had; already thought of a
scheme, ..Â« but/ before suggesting it -,r
wished "^toXbe sure it was-asgood as
it seemed.'"' Also, there was a funda

CHAPTER III.* ;. *, ' ;
\u25a0 Sayler "Draxrs the Lint." . / : :*,. ;
In February the railways traversing
our State sent to -the capltol a";bill that
had been drawn byoijr- ablest lawyers
and, reviewed" by the crartiest "pf. the
great corporation' lawyers of New York
City." Its purpose! most shrewdly and
slyly concealed, was to exempt j the rail
ways from practically all It
was so subtly, worded that this would be
disclosed only when the companies should
be brought into court for refusing to pay
their usual share of the ;taxes. Such
measures are usually "straddled" through
a. Legislature^that is, neither party takes
the responsibility, but the 'boss of each
machine assigns to vote for them air the
men whose seats are secure any
ordinary assault of public indignation.' ln
this case, of the ninety-one \ .members of
tne lower house? thirty-two were assigned
by . Dunkirk and seventeen j 6y* Siillman to
make up a majority, with three fto* spare.
My boss, Dominick, got wind that Dun-"
kirk and Sllliman >were cutting .an extra
melon of uncommon fsize. He -descended
upon the capltol and \ served notice on
Dunkirk that the eleven. Dominick. men
assigned, to vote fpr,the bill would, vote
against' it unless jhe got $71)00 apiece \ for
themâ s77,ooo. Dunkirk needed every, qn'^f
Domjnick's : men. to. make up histportlbn
of the majority;;he yielded af terUfylng in
vain to reduce the "price. All' Dominick
would say'to; him" pn jthat';polnt,^so I 1

Next: day, just: before, the voting be

â¢ Fessenden' accompanied \u25a0 me" to 'the
door. "The old man's in a hell of a %
humor to-night." said he. ''His wife's
caught on. to a little game, he's been
up to, and she's the. only, human being
lies afraid of. She came in here, 6no
ni Jht, and led him out by the ear. What
a fool a man is to marry when there's
a chance of running into a.- moss like
that! But â you made a hit with him.
He-sides, he needs you. Your familyâ"
Buck checked himself, 'feeling that/
drink was making him voluble.
"He's a strong man, isn't he?" said
I; "a born leader.". ;
"Middle-weight champion in his day,"
replied Fessenderi.- "He can still knock
out anybody in the organization. in one
round." \. , . \u25a0
- "Good-night -and thank you," said I.
So I went my way, not elated but ut
terly . depressedâ more depressed than
when I won the first case in which I
knew, ray clients- opponent was in the
right and had lost only because I out
generaled his .stupid lawyer. I was,
like most of the sons and daughters of
the vigorous families of. the earnest,
deeply religious early West, an idealist
by inheritance and *y training; but I
suppose any young man, however prac
tical,-must feel a shock when he begins
those compromises between theoretical
amft practical right which. are part of
the daily routine of â¢ active life, and
without which active life is impossible.
. I had said nothing to my mother, be
cause I did not wish to raise her hopes
âor her objections. â¢ I now decided to
be silent until the matter should be set
tled. The next day but one Fessenden
came, bad news in his face. "The old
man liked you," he began, "but â " .
I had not then learned to control my.
expression. I could not help showing
what ruins of lofty castles that, omin
ous "but. dropped upon my head. .
â¢*' You'll' soon be used to getting it in
the neck if you stay in politics," said
Fessenden. "There's not much, else.
But you ain't so bad. off as you think.
The old man has. decided .that he can
afford to run one of his reliable hacks
for the place. He's suddenly found a
way of sinking his hooks in the head
devil of the reformers and Ben Cass'
chief backer, Singerâ you know himâ the
lawyer." . > i -V-^â¢.."'
Singer was one of the leaders of the
State tÂ»ar and superintendent of our Sun
day-school. .
"Dominick has made De } Forest give
Sfnger the law business of the Gas and
Street Railway Company, so Singer iis
coming over to us.'%Buck grinned. < "He
has found that 'local interests must 'be
to the broader ..interests cf
the party in State and. nation.' " .- .:*'.,,.
I had been reading inour party's-morri-';;
ing paper what a. wise and patriotic iriove
Singer had made in advising the putting,
off of a reform campaignâ and 'I had; be- .
lieved In the sincerity. of; his motive! ;"*.' !
Fessenden echoed my. sneer, and y went,
on: - "He's a rotten hypocrite;, but,* then,.'
we can always pull the bung, out of these
reform movements that way.'' r. â¢
"You said it isn't as, bad for. me as it
seems," I interrupted.,- ... ...
"Oh, yes. You're to be. on the. ticket.'
The old man's going to send yon to the
Legislatureâ lower house, of -course."..
I did not cheer up. An Assemblyman
got only a thousand a year. .
"The pay ain't m'aeh,'.' confessed Buck,
"but there ain't nothing to do except vote
according to order. Then .there's a great
dear to be picked up onthe^'sideâ the old
man understands that others have got .to
live beside him. Salaries in politics don't
cut no figure nowadays, anyhow. -It's .
the chance the place gives for. pick-ups."'
At first I flatly refused, but Buck point
ed out that I was foolish . to., throw away
the benefits sure to come through the
"old man's" liking for me. "Ht'll. take
care of you," he assured me. ~. "He's got
you booked for a quick rise.*,' My poverty,
was so pressing that I had not the'cour
age .to refuseâ the year and, a .half of â¢
ferocious struggle and the longing to '
marry Betty Crosby had combined to
break my spirit. I believe It is Johnson
who says the worst feature of genteel .
poverty 1c its power to make one ridlcu- ,
lous. .1 don't think so. No; its worst
feature is its power' to. make one afraid.
That night I told my mother of my
impending' "honors." We were in the
dark on our little front porch. She
was silent, and presently I thought I
heard her suppressing a sigh. "You
don't like it, mother?" said I.
"No, Harvey, butâ l see no' light
ahead fn any other direction, and I
guess one should always steer toward
what light there le." She stood behind
my chair, put her hands ori my shoul
dfrs, and rested her chin lightly on the
Â«top of my head. "Besides. I can trust
you. Whatever direction you take,
you're sure to win in the end."_
I was glad it was dark. An hour
after I went to beu I heard some one
stirring in the house â it seemed ;to me
there was a voice, too. I rose and went
into, the hall, and so, softly t<s .my
mother's room. Her door wa.s> ajar.
She was near the. window, kneeling
there in Â» Â« moonlight, praying â .
I had not been lon~g in the Legisla
ture before I saw. that my, position was :
even more contemptible than I-antici
pated. So contemptible, Indeed, was it
that, had I not been, away from home
and among those as "basely situated as
myself, it would have bden Intolerableâ
a . convict Infinitely prefers' the peril-;
tentlary.tothe chain; gang. Then, too,
there was consolation ,in the fact hat
the people,' my fellow citizens, in their
stupidity and ignorance about political
conditions, did not -eallze what public
office had come to mean. At home, they
believed what the maebme-controjied;
newspapers said of meâ that I was a
"manly, independent young man," - that :
I was "making a vigorous; stand- for'
what was honest in public affairs,". that
I was the "honorable and distinguished
son of an honorable and 'distinguished
father." How often I read' those and
similar eulogies of young' men -Just 1
starting in public, life! And; is.it not
really amazing that the" people believe,
that they never say to , themselves:
"But, If he were actually .what he so.
loudly professes^ to be, how. could; he
have got public office from a boss and a
machine?" . . . (CoÃtinued ea Pace FÂ«n>

Of course, it was Raffles' hand that
they had, but now I was in : the hall
among them.- (A red-faced barrel of a
boy did all the holding, one hand round
the wrist, the other palm -to , palm,. and
his knees braced up against the .panel.)
Another was rendering ostentatious but
ineffectual aid, and three-or four others
danced about in their pajamas. After
all, they' were not ,-'. more than four ; to
one. I had raised my voice/ so that â¢
Raffles might hear me 'and take heart,
and now I raised itaKain. '.Yet tothis
day I cannot account for my inspira-.
tion, that proved nothing less.
"Don't, talk so loud," they were crying
below their breath, "don't wake 'em up

"After him, after him!" they exclaimed

"But I think he got over the wall"â â
"Come on, you " chaps, come, on." \u25a0
AiJd there was a soft stampede to the
hall door.
"Don't all desert me," I say!" gasped,
the red-faced hero who held Raffles pris
oner. ...
"We must have them both, i-'cefy!" '
"That's allTyery; well"â
"Look here," I interposed, Vl'll stay

"Thanks, awfully," said the valiant
Beefy. "
The hall was empty now. My . heart
beat high.
"How did you hear them?" I inquired,
my eye running over him. ' r
' "We were' down having 'drinksâ game

Beefy jerked his great head toward an
open door, and the' tall of my eye caught
the' glint of glasses in the firelight, but
the rest of it was otherwise engaged. '. â¢

the white of his eyes showed all round

At the same moment I heard the

young voices on the other side of the
door, and a faint light shone round
Raffles' wrist.
"Well done. Beefy!"

he whispered. , "I'm done."

Raffles leave me held by a hand'
through a hole in a door? What he
would have^done in my place was -the
thing for me to do now. I besan by
niving headfirst through the. pantry
window and coming to earth upon.a ll

brushed the gravel â¢ from the palms ' of

next. And yet I was half-way.- to the

those by Acheron, and. so over Ted- 1
dington bridge.
I often wonder why the pantry-win
dow is the vulnerable point of nine
houses out of ten.. This house of ours
was almost the tenth, for the window
in question had bars of sorts, but not
the right sort. The only bars that
Raffles allowed to beat him were the
kind that are let into the stone out
side; those fixed within are \u25a0 merely
screwed to the woodwork, and you may
unscrew as many as necessary if you
take the trouble and have the time.
Barred windows are usually devoid ot
other fasteners worthy the name;
this one was no exception to that fool
ish rule, and a push with the pen
knife did its business. I am giving
householders some valuable hints and
perhaps deserving a good mark from
the critics. These, in any case, are the
points that I would see to were I a
rich stock broker in a riverside sub
urb. In giving good advice, however,
I should hot have omitted to say that
we had left our machines in the semi
circular shrubbery in front, or that
Raffles had most Ingeniously fitted our
lamps with dark slides, which en
abled us to leave them burning.
It proved sufficient to unscrew the bars
at the bottom only, and then to wrench
them to either side. Neither of us had
grown stout with advancing - years, and
in a few minutes we had both wormed
through into the sink, and thence to the
floor. It was not an absolutely noiseless
process, but once in the pantry we were
mice, and no longer blind mice. There
was a gas bracket, but we did not meddle
with that. Raffles went armed these
nights with a better light than gas; if
it were not immoral, I might recommend
a dark lantern which was more or less
his patent. It was that handy invention,
the electric torch, fitted by Raffles with
a dark hood to fulfill the functions of a
slide. I had held it through the bars
while he undid the screws, and now he
held It to the keyhole, in which a key
was turned upon the other side.
There .was a pause for consideration,
and in the pause we put on ' our. masks.
It was never known that these Thames
Valley robberies were all committed by
miscreants decked in the livery of crime,
but that was because until this night
we had never even shown our masks.
It was a point upon which Raffles had
insisted on all feasible occasion's since
his furtive return to the world. To-night
it twice nearly lost us everythingâ but
you shall hear.
There is a forceps for â¢ turning keys .
from the wrong side of the door, but
the implement is not so easy of manipu
lation as it might be. Raffles, for one,
preferred a sharp knife and the corner of
the panel. You go through the panel
because that is thinnest, of course, in
' the corner nearest the key, and you use
a knife when you can, because it makes
least noise, , But' it does takes minutes,
and even I can remember shifting the
electric torch from one hand to the other
before the aperture was large enough to
receive the hand and wrist of^Rafflcs.
He had at such times a m6tto of which
I might have made earlier use, but the
fact Is that I have only once before
described a downright burglary In which
1 assisted, and that without knowing it
at the time. The most solemn student
of these annals cannot . affirm that he
has cut through many doors in our com
pany since (what was to me)' the maiden
effort to which I allude. I, however,
have cracked only too many a crib in
conjunction with A. J. Raffles,, and that
at the crucial moment he would whisper:
"Victory or -Wormwood Scrubbs, Bunny!"
or Instead of Wormwood Scrubbs it
might be Portland Hill. This time it
was neither one nor the other, for with
that very wprd "victory" upon his lips
they whitened and parted with the first
taste of defeat. \u25a0 V; . "

MY brother Ralph, who now lived
with me on the edge of Ham
Common, had come home from
Australia with a curious affec
tion of the eyes, due to long
exposure to the glare out there, and
necessitating the use of clouded specta
cles In the open air. He had not the rich
complexion ot the typical colonist, being,
Indeed, particularly pale, but it appeared
that he had been confined to his berth
tor the greater part of the voyage while
his prematurely gray hair was sufficient
proof that the rigors of bush life had at
last undermined an originally tough con
stitution. Our landlady, who spoiled my
brother troa thÂ« first, was much con
cerned on his behalf and wished to call in
the local doctor, but Ralph said dreadful
things about the profession and quite
frightened the good woman by arbitrarily
forbidding her to ever let a doctor inside
her door. I biA to apologize to her for
the painful prejudices and violent lan
guage of "these colonists," but the old
â¢col was easily mollified. She had fallen
la love with my brother at first sight,
tad *h* never oould do too much for him.
It mm owing to our landlady that I took
to gÂ»THng him Ralph, for the first tlma
la our lives, on her beginning to speak
of and to him as "Mr. Raffles."
*^HÂ» won't do," said he to me. "It's a
came that sticks." ' \
â¢â¢It must be my fault. She must have
heard It from me." said I. self-reproach
fully. N
"You must tell her it's the short for
Ralph."
"But it's longer."
"It's the short." said he. "and you've
got to tell her bo."
Henceforth 1 heard as much of "Mr.
Ralph," his likes and his dislikes, what
he would fancy and what he would not,
and, oh. what a dear gentleman- he was,
that I often remembered to say, "Ralph,
old chap," myself.
Jt was an ideal cottage, as I said when
1 found it. and in it our delicate man be
came rapidly robust. Not that the air
was also ideal, for when it was not rain
ing we had the same faithful mist from
November to March. But it was some
thing to Ralph to get any air at all other
iliau isight air, and the bicycle did the
;<.st. WÂ« taught ourselves, and may I
iltver forget our earlier rides through
und through Richmond Park when tne
aiternoons were shortest upon the Incom
parable Ripley road when we gave a day
to it- Raffles rode a Beeston Humber; a
Koyal Sunbeam was good enough for me.
liut he insisted on our both having Dun
lop tires.
"They seem the most popular brand.
I had my eye on the road all the way
from Ripley to Cobham. and there were
more Dunlop marks than any other
kind. Bless you, yes, they all leave
their special tracks, and we don't want
ours to be extra special; the Dunlop's
like a rattlesnake, and the Palmer
leaves telegraph wires, but surely the
serpent is more in our line."
That was the winter when there were
so many burglaries in the Thames Val
ley from Richmond upward. It was
said that the thieves used bicycles in
every caÃe, but what is not said? They
were sometimes on foot, to my knowl-
I edge, and we took a great interest in
Vthe series, or. rather, sequence, of suc
cessful crimes. Raffles would often get
his devoted old lady to read him the
latest local accounts, while I was busy
with my writing (much I wrote) in my
own room. "We even rode out by night
ourselves to see if we could not get on
the tracks of the thieves, and never did
w Â« fall to find hot coffee on the hob
for our return. We had indeed fallen
upon our feet. Also, the misty nights
might have been made for the thieves.
But their success was not so consistent
and never so enormous as people said,
especially the sufferers, who lost more
valuables than they had ever been
known to possess. Failure was often
the caitiffs' portion, and disaster once;
owing, ironically enough, to that very
mist which should have served them.
But I am going to tell the story with
some particularity, and perhaps some
gusto, you will see why who read.
The right house stood on high ground
near the river, with quite a drive (in at
one gate and out at the other) sweep-
Ing past the steps. Between the, two
gates was a half-moon of shrubs, to
the left of the steps a conservatory,
and to their right the walk leading to
the tradesmen's entrance and the back
premises; here also was the pantry win
dow, of which more anon. The right
house was the residence of an opulent
stock broker, who wore a heavy watch
chain and seemed fair game. There
would have been two objections to it
had I been the stock broker. The house
' was oqÂ« of a row, though a goodly row,
and an army-crammer had established
himself next door. There^ is a type of.
Â»iuch institutions in the suburbs, the
youths go about in knickerbockers,
smoking pipes, except on Saturday
nights, when they lead each other home
from the last train. It was none of
our business to spy upon these boys,
but their manners and customs fell
within the field of observation- And
we did not choose the night upon which
the whole row was likely to be kept
a ivake.
The night that we did choose was as
misty as even the Thames Valley is
capable .of making them. Raffles
smeared vaseline upon the plated parts
of bis Beeston Humber before starting,
and cur dta.r landlady cosseted us both
and prayed we might see nothing of
thfi vasty burglars, not denying as the
reward would be very handy to them
that 'got it. to say nothing of the honor

than, earlier dn life.- .We are not the
same people at 40 .that we were at 20,
nor at 50 that we were at 35. Our char
acters have broadened. We have taken
in new ideas from many sources."
Great, disparity cf age should . be.
avoided.-- The man of '50 seldom seeks
a" wife .near, him In age. but let him
beware of paying court to a very young
girl. She and he will, look, at '-life from
a different They will not
be on v the same plane. If she be social
and , he prefers: an armchair und the 1
evening lamp at home, there will be In
evitable jars. .
.A' father who has young daughters
in. their early womanhood should not
bring Into their "mother's place a wife
who is about the age of his own eldest
girl. Occasionally, but rarely, such 'a
choice turns out well. When it docs
it reflects- great honor- on all con
cerned. Generally it results in. heart
ache and. friction all. around anil often
It causes 'a: broken home and irreebncil-"
ivble antagonism follows. - - -;.
-Many wives would do/well to cease their,
laborious struggle and no longer neces
sary self-ab.negation when prosperity
comes to their husbands, and to begin* at
once 'the' sort of life his second wife
woujd live. They may 'as well array
themselves In soft f raiment and insist on
adequate '? help In : the household before
they^ are ; laid upon a sickbed. Excellent
and devoted husbands aTe often thought
less. : T6' their eyes Jenny looks" well in
anything. It never occurs to them that
she : ; is wearing- a .frumpy gown or a
dowdy hat. ; ' They would be 'willlng'to
give- her "anything she craved' if they
recognized a lack. By every law the -first
marriage, that union of hearts which be-,
gins when man, and woman, are in the
gladness a,nd"sJtrength\of their 'early day.
should be the one perfect and rounded
sphere, the one glorious fruition-. within
reaoh of humanity. It is not always this,
because human nature is a poor. Imper
fect thins, of shreds and patches. But It
may be made ideal if people^ live up to.
heir - privileges of 'goodness "and unself

A second marriage should not have to .
face criticism ;and, unkind comment.-.' It,
too, should have a; chance for expansion
in all that is .worth while. : A, man once
eaid to me: '^Vheii my- first wife died I
determined "to remain faithful : to , her
memory, and for.tan years I did. But 1
married then,."' and now I am sorry for
the : possible- seven years I might have-,

I was over the crest of the hill, the grayi
road reeling out from under me as 1 felt,
for my brake. I looked back at \u25a0 Raffles.
He had "put 1 up his feet. I screwed my 1
head around still; further, and there were (
the boys in their pajamas, their : hands
upon their knees, like. so many wicket- 1
keepers, and a big man shaking Mils tisl. i
There was a lamppost on. the hilltop, and
that was the last I saw. :*-\u25a0 ,
We sailed down to the river, . then on I
through Thames Dltton as far as Esher
station, when we turned ehairp to tho
right, and from the dark stretch -by Im-<
ber Court came to light In Molesey and (
were soon pedaling like j gentlemen of
leisure through Bushley Park.:' our lights^
turned up, the broken torcb"put;out and(
away.. The big gates had long been'shut, )
but you can maneuver a L.cycle â¢ through
the others. We had no c further adven- (
tures on . tho way home, and our . coffee
was still warm upon the hob.
"But I think it's an occasion for Sulli- /
vans," said Raffles, who now kept them )
for such. "By air my gods. Bunny. It's \
been the most sporting night we ever had (
in our lives! And do you know which ,
was the most sporting part of it?"- â¢\u25a0 \
"That up-hUI ride?" (
"I wasn't thinking of it." .
"Turning your torch into a truncheon?"
"My dear Bunny! A gallant ladâ i \

"I know," I said. "The way you got us
out of the house!" . ' '\u25a0' '
"No, Bunny," said Raffles, blowing (
rings. "It came before . that, you sinner, ,
and you know it!" ' : ; #-

I, self-consciously, for, I began to see that|

when runs ; were wanted." -_\ !
And he held out his dear old hand. ,
that almost eveiybody would have done
in my place. Kaffles. indeed, said he
would have done it himself, but that was
his generosity, and he was the one man
who would 'not. What I did was to turn
in the opposite direction to the other gate,
where we . might so easily -have been
cut off,, and to pedal for my liferâ uphill!
j "My God!". I, shouted when I found it
out.
"Can you turn in your own length?"
asked Rattles, following loyally.
"Not certain."
"Then stick to it. You couldn't help
it. But it's the devil of a hill I"
"And here they come!"
"Let them," said Raffles, and bran
dished his electric torch, our only light
as yet.
A hill neems endless in the dark, for
you. cannot .see the end. and with the
patter of bare feet gaining on us. 1
thought this one could have no end at
all. Of course the boys could charge up
it quicker than we could â¢ pedal, but I
even, beard .the voice of their stout in
structor growing louder through the
mist. . :
"Oh, to think I've- let you in for this!"
I groaned, my head over . the handle
bars, every ounce of my weight first on
one foot and then on the other. I glanced
at Raffles, and in the white light of his
torch he was doing It all with his ankles,
exactly as though he bad been riding In
a gymkhana. ' ...
"It's the most sporting chase I was ever
in." he said. . - ; .
"All my fault" .
"My dear Bunny. I wouldn't have miss
ed It for the world!"
Nor would he forge ahead of me,
though' ho could have done so in a mo
ment, he who from his boyhood had done
everything of the kind so much better
than anybody else. No, he must ride a
wheel's length behind me. and now we
could not only hear the boys running, but
breathing also. And then of a sudden I
saw Raffles on my right striking, with his
torch; a face flew out or tho darkness to
meet the thick glass bulb. with the glow
ing wire Inclosed; it was the fa.cc of the
boy Olphert, with his enviable mustache,
but it vanished with the crash of glass
and the naked wire thickened to the eye
like a tuning- fork struck red-hot.
I saw no, more of that. One of them
had crept up on my side also; as I looked
hearing him pant, he ' was grabbing Jat
my left handle, and I nearly sent Raf

Girls can be very cruel.' They do not
mean -to be <.ruel, : but because cf their
youth, their quick enthusiasm, their im
pulsiveness and the intoleraricp they" have
for whatever does not. please them, they
often cause si great deal of "suffering

they knew what they were doing.
A teacher may be fighting a battle that
you jrirls' cannot in the least appreciate.
If shy has been in 'the' harness several
years her nerves ate probably very much
worn. If every one tries to make.t he
day's work Â«?asy for her there, will be few
complaints about her crossness. v I am. al
ways glad when I hear of girls who adore
a teacher. The adoration maybe a little
inconvenient tp her, and it: is sometimes
a trifle overdone, for girls live In ylie 'su
perlative. They are vtry apt. to talk "in
italics, and use too. much emphasis. I'-But1 '- But
if their teacher is sweet; gracious arid; re
tined, if her personal ways are dainty and
her dress is neat .and trim, they uncon
sciously imitate her.' ' V % " ".

~- I~7* HERE . will be one comfort,"
I . sald Dorothy to me conflden-
I tially. as we sat on the veran
\u25a0 da last night after tea, "Next
year I won't have such a cross
teacher as I have had in the seventh
grade. Miss Louise in the sixth grade
was lovely. All the girls adored her.
She could do anything with us she liked,
and we would work to please her, ' and
never disappoint her if we could help it.
But it has been very different since we
came into Miss Emily's room. Not a
girl in the class can bear her, except per
haps two or three who are her pets. She
Is simply horrid to the rest and we shall
bid her good -by with relief. I can't im
agine why the board keeps teachers who
are so cross and disagreeable and who
just try to make girls unhappy and dis
contented."
After this long speech. Dorothy gave
her golden hair a little shake and looked
up at me with those laughing brown
eyes that would seem to defy crossness
in anybody.
"I wonder," said I musingly, "wheth
er the fault is all with the teacher. Have
not you girls been contrary and perverse
anu hard to control? Did you not go into
that class having made up your mind
that you would not have a good tims
there? Has not poor Miss Emily a repu
tation for crossness that has been hand
ed down or ud from class to class, so
that she never had with any of you what
might be called a fair show? Have you
always conscientiously tried to be. as
loyal to her as you wers to the teacher
of whom you were fond?'" :â¢'.\u25a0\u25a0
"Certaiuly .not," feaid Dorothy, frankly.
"Nobody can be loyal to a teacher whom
everybody dislikes. We; have done our
work, but we have not enjoyed doing
it. and I, for my part, should not care
if I never met Miss Emily again. I- have
heard, though, that there are two Miss
Emilys. Gladys and Winifred, the girls
who are her favorites, have never found
any fault with her in the classroom,
and they say that she- is charming out
of school. Why must there be two per
sons "In a teacher?i: Why can she not be
as nice in ons place as in another?"
The question you ask. though 1 you do
not know it, mychild, is as deep as the
sea and as old as the glfebc: There are
two persons in most ; bf-us. With some
people and in some places 4 we show our
best selves, and with other, people and
in other places we show- our worst. :. I
have no doubt uiat the feeling of irri

About the farmhouse Itself, if the*ele

the establishment could be characterized
IN one of Da\id Graham Phillips'
books. I think "The Cost," there is
a striking portrayal of two character
istic American types: the one, the
s'our.g patrician college" type from
out of the East, the product of countless
Generations of Intelligent and wealthy an
cestors; the other a young husky from
out of the unancestored West, the product
of many removes of sturdy but yeoman
forbears. He of the aristocratic lineage
Is quick to learn, the grooves of his mind
are refjned and work smoothly; his oppo
site slow. The thing is up for discussion
between them, and the exquisite, with
easy familiarity, says:
"Oh. it's nothing. My esteemed ances
tors have been doing nothing for some
centuries back save make money and
brains. I ought to have some of the re- \u25a0
suits."
In a sense he was right, and In a senso
wrong. It is not always true that the re
sults of interbreeding and cultivation for
a higher product are constant. But to the
degree to which they are are his words
peculiarly applicable to the breeding of
race horses.
In the constant grafting and crossing
of high-bred stock upon high-bred stock
lies the secret of the breeding of race *
horses for speed and endurance. Dan
Patch was no accident: nor Lou Dillon.
nor Major Delmar; no more so than. the
thoroughbred patrician is the accident of
a spontaneous generation. It takes the
refined hand of experience and the pol
ishing wheel of time. In ISO 6 the one mile
American trotting record was held by
Yankee, in 2:59; in 1903. ninety-seven years
later, Lou Dillon, at Memphis. Term.. set
the mark just one minute and one-half
second less, when she trotted the mile in
J:sS'.i.
It was something more than the natural
order of things that lopped a minute and
onc-haJI a second off the rrottine rec
ords of American horses during that
ninety-seven years. It was the product
of almost a century of study and cease
less care on the part of a long line of
trainers and breeders, whose names have
been famous in their time and day. It
eeems hardly probable that the record
will ever be lowered very materially
from the place It Is now, and yet no one
can cay what another century of en
lightened training and breeding methods
may do for race horses.
"it. is constant grind that makes a
thoroughbred- It takes not weeks, but
years of unceasing, untiring eSfdrt. You
can't sit down on the top rail of a pad
dock fence when your year's crop of
colts have been shipped away and call
it a job. There is no rest. You have
got to keep going all the time. When
the yearlings are off your hands you have
got the stallions and the mares to care
for.- Their coriSitlon must be absolutely
and ideally perfect. Stables and grounds
must be looked after, not once a wee-.
but every minute of the day. The disci
pline on a farm of this kind, where every
paddock and every .box stall holds horses
of the finest pedigree, must be absolute.
I get up at four in the morning and to
bed when I can."
Coming from a man with the national
reputation that Manager George berry
of the Napa Stock Farm holds, and com
ing from a man who last season took
to New York his year's crop of nineteen
colts and secured at auction the phen
omenal price of $26,000 for the lot. those
/ words should carry weight.
j! But if nature ever conspired with man
for the attainment of an end. nature
did that for the breeding of race horses
at this stock farm. Located a short dis
tance out from Napa, the farm covers
in ail eight hundred acres, in the main
level, fertile bottom land bordering the
Nepa Creek. In all there are but thirty
five acres of hill land, and that but
the low rolling land characteristic of
California . foothill country. The entire
area, aside from that occupied by build-
Edward H. Hurlbut.
ings arid homestead . grounds, is divided
into paddocks of different sfzes, each pad r
dock equipped with a . self-filling water
trough supplied from a thirty-thousand
tank. That tank is emptied three
time's. a day, which will' give some idea
to the lay mind of the activity carried
on at the. farm. All of this Mr. Berry
explains- as ; the. drive is being made
from Napa . station.
After a brief drive along the hard, well
kept Napa roads one comes suddenly. to
a driveway bordered with tall,- shapely
poplars. Everywhere isMhe red; White
and blue of the A. B. Spreckels stable.
It first greets you from tho gate, posts,
then from the fences, and later from
the horse blankets of the horses them
selves.
When we. drive up to the training
barn it . even greets you from. ;. the
sweater of Solomon Bonner, as he touches
his hat respectfully to,', the", manager.
Solomon Bonner is a great jockey, says
Manager .Berry: one of the very .great
est. " Solomon grins' cheerfully and with
much display of teeth. Solomon is en
gaged to ride horses In training at the
farm at a salary that'would^make a batik
president almost apologize. Solomon tips
his hat again and walks nonchalantly
away; evidently, high cockalorum o!f "the
training stables, where there is a small
army of stable " men arid boys, and a
covered eighth-mile track for exercising
in rainy weather.
The training stable, for -breaking tha
.yearlings. Is an oval stable precisely one
eighth of a mile in circumference, as the
exercising track testifies, which circles the
outer walls. In the center is a large, paved
court, open to the sky, containing self
filling, modern, cement drinking troughs.
Perhaps : there aarte t from seven to. nine
men and boys Industriously scraping and
hauling and putting things into spick and
span shape. Everywhere Is the evidence
of system and .discipline;' from the scru
pulous cleanliness prevailing to the
spectful attitude of the employes.
At the training stable tach In his well
lighted, well and sani
tary box stall are tw'erity-four; yearling
colts, broken only to the halter, ready for
shipment on the morrow to New Y<jrk- to
be sold at auction at Shetp'shead . Bay.
That Is why. Manager .Berry is so busyto
day; it is no slight task to prepare for
shipment twenty-four head of valuable
bo tritely, . the lawns, flower gardens and
walks remind '.one jof; nothing-, save the
grounds one sees around tire \u25a0; Government

"You can say. this.'! : : Manager j Berry
goes on, ( when we kre , seated ; upon the
broad veranda, "tHat: there' is on; this

Then there suddenly appears on- the

.little woman, before whose/look- Mr.
Berry, wilts dutifully. '. We needed no In

troduces us all around. "Gentlemen. thf3

do things' li'ttle incidents like lunch hours
and retiring and rising, hours, and such,
are riot even of the importance of motes
in a sunbeam.
\u25a0 Mr. Berry talked cheerfully on appar
ently oblivious of such 'annoying things
as dinner gongs; while I vainly endeav-
vrprts; bid nevertheless manajed to set
out. During the. progress of lunch the
talk, naturally, drifted to horses, and
trainer C. "W. Carroll, a man well known
to tho profession but perhaps not sew
widely known to 'outsiders as' Mr. Berry!^
delivered himself of a sentiment which,
upsets a gaodjnnany pet horse theories.
Apropos of . a runaway In the neighbor
hood Mr. Carroll, said: "You may think
you ' know a | horse. You ' may eat wltn
him. slees with him and talk with him.
If you wish: but you can't for all that
get such control over a horse that" you
can tell what he Is going to do In *
pinch. ..You may think you know him.
but you don't" Which. I. guess, 13 large
ly true, not that I know much about
horses. ,
After luncheon we are shown throujrfi
the "farm- house." fitted and furnished
perhaps as elaborately and yet with as
quiet elegance as any club house or pri
vate residence In tho State. The main \u25a0â¢
drawing room, a large*, .well lighted room,
cost In the oak fittings . alone $3000. I
heard: some of 'the other figures, but not
having a mind that can comprehend any
thing; over a twenty, and ' seldom has an
opportunity to comprehend that for a
very extended while. *I confess they have
faded from my recollection.
, "We breed? for size, quality, bone and
conformation." Mr. Berry is saying as we
stroll around' aftar luncheon smoking Mr. <
Berry's cigars. "As I said- before, it takes
time and patience agd care. This Is the*
"stallion barn."
,' Solitaire II and Marlus II were led outâ
fine, clean' cut. absolutely handsome and
magnetic looking brutes. Some way the
figure of the two fellows in the book
came back. .to me. No chance generation
could have produced those virile, glossy,
perfectly molded figures.
We* were passing through a small pad
dock where a mare and her foal are rub
bing noses. That never falls to be a
touching picture, and even Manager Ber
ry, to whom it must be an old picture,
pauses while he. says; with a touch *#>t
pride: "That Is Monrovia, dam of Ac^K;
lita. She was a triple Oaks winner."
. A famous animal in her day,' now hap
pily quartered upon this big farm. wherÂ»
mares and their progeny. ar<j treated with
the consideration of mothers and babes;
contentedly rubbing noses- with. her Uttls
offspring: telling her many, tricks, of the
track, maybe: coaching her up to tho
time when she. too. will go against thÂ»
barrier for the honor of her dam and her
sire and her stable.
' As we pass by she stretches her thin.
sleek neck out affectionately, and we
stroke her glossy skin, while the long
legged, frolicsome little fllly scampera
skittishly away. It was almost human.
I So from place to place we go. through
the green and glqwing beauty of the corn
arid the alfalfa. to*thc paddocks, where
the foal 3 are being fed. | HerÂ© the mares
are shut out by bars, just low enough to
prevent tiiem entering and just high
enough for theMlttle foals to get under.
Then on over to the half-mtle racetrack,
where. Bonner Is. putting . a promising
maiden through her paces. Then we
â¢ stumble upon a little orchard, where
therÂ« is fresh fruitâ and fre?h fruit right
off the tree is a rarebit for the man fed
from the week-old, fruit of ' the J stalls.
Over all. the glorious climate of the Napa
Valleyâ the climate that makes a veter
inary at this farm an anomaly.
The afternoon whiles away and the
train whistles faintly in the distance. The
smart little trap is brought around and
we are off. But the last thing of all. and
the one memory of all that, stands out
the most clear, is the picture of Monrovia,
.rubbing noses peacefully with her llttlÂ©
foal. :-â¢:-

Does It all payâ this concentration of

pends on generalship. At the center, of
things there must be the single, far
reaching force, the one great directing
power.
Always the MAN is necessary as well
as the means.
All the moneys and materials for an
enterprise, all the soldiers for a battle,
are as nothing without that special hu
man power to organize and put in opera
tion the means, that Ddwer to conceive
and foresee and overseeâ the amalgamat
ing power, as it were. f
And so It Is that as I wait In the Pal
ace reception-roomâ which, the god of un
holsterers be thanked, has been cleared of
its "Oriental" rubbish and is once more
simple, cool and possible to breathe inâ l
feel a keen curiosity and anxious interest
in the man who built the subway.
He is here on' a short visit of Investi
gationâhe has run over from New York
to San Francisco as he would from New
York to Hobokenâ at the Invitation of the
association of San Franciscans who are
looking to the future of the city as pride
fully and conscientiously as a. fond father
to the future of his son. San Francisco
Is growing astonishingly, and even in the
present hobbledehoy stage is gi\lng*prom
ise of a splendid future. It is for this
future, when the city borders will extend
no one may say how far and the city
census will number no one may venture
what big figure, that the plans are being
made now. Already the distances and
tangle of traffic hint that a subway may
be needed, and Mr. Parsons has come
here to look over the ground and tell how
it may be built.
I confess to an anxious interest as I
wait for him.
Preconceived notions are a - folly, but
that doesn't put a stop to them. Of
course, I have my notion to be realized,
and I don't want this man whose work
has Inspired it to disappoint me. I would
take it as unkind, uncomplimentary. So
I am anxious. .
Sometimes, I have discovered, the
man who does a big thing or a great
thing is disappointing â a lopsided man
developed only along the line of his
special talent, atrophied on all other
sides, a phenomenon rather than an in
dividual.
The man who built the subway ar
rives, according to appointment, and
he doesn't disappoint, not even in ap
pearance.
He is a big man physically â in har
mony with his capacity and the scope
of his work; big and broad-should
ered and spare, as you expect the man
of activity to be.
There are big men'of small \u25a0 stature,
and I could have endured it, and for
given, if he had turned out to be, a
little man. but not if he had turned
out a beauty.
He is not a beauty; useful men sel
dom are.
I know of only two great men so
gifted â Byron and Embasaador Choate. '
Poor Byron -was great In spite of his
beauty perhaps, and much of Choatb's
greatness Is due to his personal charm.
But the builder of the subway is not â¢
a beauty. He's too strong and master
ful looking for that, -with too much of
the bulldog contour In the broad, mass-
THE big man, the truly big man,
is the simplest.
This is nr experience as well as
my faith, and when I meet William
Barclay Parsons, the man who built
the New York subway, the man who
will build the San Francisco subway if
ever she has one. I find my faith con
firmed once sg-ain.
By their -works shall ye know them.
says an earlier authority than the Sun
day supplement, and. if this be true,
surely there can be no two opinions
about the man \u25a0who built the subway.
v He is indeed a big man. for there is
no bigger achievement in the line of
modern achievements '"than the New
York subway â and It takes big men to
do big things.
There 2s nothing just like that New
Tork subway.
( The xsan who built it cautions me
that there are other subways â a little
one in Budapest and one of a mile and
a half in Boston, and that they are suc
cesses; that Chicago in time will have
one; but he admits on my Insistence
and "without mock modesty that they
axe not comparable with the New York
subway, "because." he explains with
scrupulous carefulness, "each work of
this kind must be done under its own
conditions, each city presents a differ
ent problem, each city is a law unto it
self."
This, I have found. Is another char
acteristic of big men; they don't be
little their own achievements in an af
fectation of modesty. After giving their
best of life and brain and heart's desire
and the work of their hands they have
the courage and dignity to claim the
honor due, and that still finer courage
to take only so much as Is their due.
Simplicity, straightforwardness, sin
cerity, Justice and a scrupulous honesty
seem to go 'with the capacity to do big
things, and it is rare Indeed that the
naa who can win laurels for himself
will stoop to filch so much as one little
leaf out of the crown of another. It is
the aspiring weakling who capers In
borrowed â¢wreaths.
However, to get back to the New
York subway, -which Is interesting here
because It is perhaus the forerunner
and pattern of San Frqncisco's subway:
It stands quite alone â not only in
character and extent and complete
ness, but in the manner of its achieve
ment, in its history and successfulness.
The New York subway, as I hear, its
story from the man who built it, even
in the unadorned matter-of-fact, detailed,
almost technical and studiously im
personal way in which he tells it, seems
to nze something more than merely the
latest convenience for rapid transit.
There is a splendor of imagination
in these creations of our modern engi
neers and architects and builders â in
the bridges and tunnels and towering
buildings conceived to meet the re
quirements of our complex civilization
and teeming millions â that appeals as
Inspiringly as ever the glow of Imagin
ation In the Iliads or the Odysseys.
The subway itself, looking at it as a
mere utility. Is after all only a rectan
gular hole in the ground, tifty feet wide,
thirteen feet high and twenty-six mile 3
long, through which from end to end of
its bright, electric-lighted, length hun
dreds cf thousands of people are shot In
Its swiftly rushing trains, like pills in a
bottle. It Js, from the purely practical
point of view, merely a convenience, af
fcrfiicg the greatest speed and safety to
the largest number at the lowest cost.
It is not beautiful, of course, and it Is
not yet faultless, but it is impressive as
an expression of bigness and power and
daring entirely in keeping with the need
and time that produced 1L
It is representative of our development
more completely than any other one

American.
And it represents mdst fully the man
wfco made It.
depends upon him.
This Is his greatest responsibility.
A miscalculation in the plans he
made .on blue paper and submitted to
the rapid transit commission, an over
sight in the arrangement of con
veniences, say. only in the matter of
passage from one platform to an
other, and untold inconvenience and
danger might have resulted.
OH' the whole, I like my word stu
pendous in summing up the work.
And the responsibility seems stu
pendous, too. ' -
I aÂ«k him how much ths building of
the subway took out of him.
He answers with an easy laugh: "It
took some of the hair off the top of
my head."
His face Is particularly strong in re
pose, with a severe serenity. There are
none of the fine little wrinkles etched
by little worries or little worryings.
The pale gray eyes are calm and cold
ly Intelligent, not easily divertedâ the
eyes of power, and the power of con
centration also. .
On the whole I conclude I have
asked the wrong question.
This man has been master of his
task. It has never mastered him.
So I ask what he got out of the
building of the* subway.
"Some useful lessons, suggestions for
better ways and easier ways of doing
things." :
The really big man, you see. Is never
too wise to learn.
"How many lives were lost la the
building of it?" I ask.
"I am sorry to "ay that thirty men
were killed during the time of con
struction."
The matter-of-fact tone gives way to
a note of real feeliag, real regret that
makes' it clear that the lives of the
hundreds of thousands who are paying
back* the J50.000.b0a with their nickels
are la safe hands. '/Â» j
Curiosity Is not always - polite. I
want. to know how old he was when
he undertook such responsibility.
"I was only J5 when I made the
plans for the subway. Perhaps If I'd
been olderâ as old as I am nowâ l .
-wouldn't have dared to do it." ,
He says it with a laugh on the sur
face, but a convincing earnestness in
the depths.
"As a man grows older he takes en
caution and loses his courageâ or ia It
his rashness?**
"Weren't you afraid of failure?" X ask.
for the tremendous responsibility of the
$50,000,000 and the millions of lives is upon
my mind.
"No, I was not AFRAID pt failure."
"You thought you couldn't fall?"
"Oh, no; not that. A man must sea the
possibility of failure, particularly in an
untried thing, a venture such as this
was; but he must not be afraid. If he
goes into an undertaking with the fear
of failure in* his heart he can scarcely
hope to succeed. The fear of failure is
one thing. To recognize the possibility of
failure and pit yourself and all your re
sources against It is quite another thing.
"If I had to face It now, I don't think
I'd do It. but having done it once. X
know, of course, that it can be done
again," ; * X.
I want to know how it can be done
in San Francisco.
"Until I make my report I cannot tell
that to any one. Until I have* time to
think it over I do not know myself, not
in any except a general way. Each city
presents its own problem. Each city Is a
law unto itself . The problem presented
here is different to the one in New York.'
There is perhaps no city that could offer
the difficulties met with in New York,
unless it is London.
"Hera you have the hills to consider.
of course, and they would make It neces
sary to have a subway of different con
struction. You have the sand. but. we
.had sand in New York; and you have In
the lower part of Market street the
water. New York Is long and narrow.
2 San Francisco Is wide-spreading. The re
quirements here are different."
"Do you," I ask rather- rashly, "bÂ»-
Ileve^ln subwaysâ ln this shooting of the
population through underground passage
ways, and in drawing them together into
cities?" _/ - r .
"No," he says, quite frankly, and warm
ly, "I don'tâ not at all. But the cities ex
ist* and Increase and the subway meets
their need."
The' man who built the subway to not
in any sense a lop-sided manâ a man
whose bigness Is an excrescence.
He is an all-round man. developed so
cially, humanly, intellectually.
He. took his B. A. at Columbia Univer
sity, as well as his degree of civil en
gineering.
He has bis wife and children, and his
Home-life in two beautiful homes, one in
New. York. and the other on the Jersey
coast. .
He has his clubs and his boon com
panions. '
You might credit him with being,
"smart" in dress if dress were not ,'an
\u25a0 unimportant detail with himâ a thing that
be concedes -one must have, just as on*
must have good manners. ;
I ask him about his diversions. _
His work ."I guess and he admits, ia his
passion, his excess, his' dissipation. Tem
perance and moderation be exercised in
*all other things.
V"IV "I [take my, pleasures easily."; he tells
me. "I like the water and boating. I like
my friends around me. I think I like
best of all to write." > .
"As a diversion?",
"Yes. .It is a pleasure to me."

' tails to bÂ« considered made it a work

"The subway lies from a few feet to
over a hundred feet below the surface: It
Includes nearly six miles of elevated road
In Its length, It passes through sand and'
rock, it is * flanked on - either side by
the skyscrapers of lower Broadway, and
again by no structures at all. AH the
street pipes had to be considered and dis
posed of, the materials for . construction
brought together and the debris removed
and the whole thing accomplished while
the streets overhead were continued in
use. and without interfering with the
traffic of the city."
"It was stupendous,". X say again, "for
one man!" \u25a0
â¢ "Yet one man had to do it. In an
undertaking like - that the direction of
affairs must be with one man. It cannot
be divided successfully. There must be
a head; of courseâ some one who sees
the thine ' as . a whole and can direct it
â¢ from that standpoint.
"The subway was commenced March,
1900. It was put in operation October 17.
1304. T* he twenty : six miles, which In
clude nearly six _ miles of elevated road,
cost about $50,000,000. the subway itself
costing from- 13,000.000 to 15.000,0X1 a mile."
He goes on to tell me the detail of con
struction.
â¢ It Is fifty feet wide and thirteen feet
high; over allâ that Is. the full extent of
the tunnel is fifty-five feet by sixteen
and a half.
Its strength and security is not in a
system of. arches, which would have
made it impracticable on account of the
cost of construction. It is in steel cross
beams and pillars, taking a leaf out
of the architecture of tall buildings.
It .has four tracks. Two for express
trains; two for locals.- *
The express .trains run at a. speed of
forty-five miles an hour, and a minute
and a half apart. The local trains run
one minute apart.
. The platforms are so arranged that the
passenger who is in a hurry, can board
a local, pass safely from that to the
express train at the first express station,
then leaving the express train, pass again
'to a local in order to reach his destina
tion. !
-'The "stations 1 are tiled in different colors
.to make Identification easy.
The subway Is bright from end to end
with electric lights, clean, sanitary and
thoroughly ventilated.
During the hottest days of the New
York summer It betrayed one of its Im
perfectionsâit was too' hot at the stations
and In several other parts.
It has been flooded once by a' broken
- water, main.
' It has been the scene of one accident,
a collision, due, as such things are above
ground, to the fallibility* of the human
memory.
Perhaps these are dry and uninterest

which followed -on Its heels r shortly

Auntie had .a 1 dreamy, far-In-the-past

I knew stte was . reveling .In her . old

.Uncle Jason was an exemplary man;
but could any one for a moment com

would ever think of mending a mis

couplet on a fan? Connect Uncle Jason

"Do you see those two lines about In

Well. Jason and , I had not spoken for

new 'inventions put \u25a0on- the -market,- most

that we are "Just" now living in" the elec
tric age, f or# which "we should be duly
thankful. ' "- ;
It is.'a far cry from j music to shoe
blacking, but : electricity reaches them
both. | Piartos' are f play'ed and; shoes are
blacked by electricity. ; - , .
I- can ' only hope . that , the electric buffer
that \ shines the \ shoes . does better work
than the electric current that plays the
piano. \u25a0\u25a0.*" Presumably it ; does, because/it
needs soul, and temperament and indi
viduality', to produce a good result .with
the ; divine ', art 'of music, whereas the
polishing of shoes is material and earthy
and needs only power. All tae same it
Is a . great convenience and several of
my friends have them in their houses.
Then there is the electric light bathâ
which takes the place of the "hot room"
in .the Turkish bath establishment. It
has the same end In viewâ opening the
pores and superinducing perspirationâ
and it. accomplishes that. result most ef
fectually.,, , ;
At the St. Helena Sanitarium In the city
one can, have an electric light-. bath
whenever -desired. One is inclosed In a
box fitting close about the neck, the
head alone being on the outside. Within
the box there are about a hundred elec
tric lightsâ small but powerful. And how
they do start the perspiration ! And
then, with massage and cold shower, the
Turkish bath ,1s more than equaled.
These baths are frequently resorted to

and convenience of home U3e.

home at night only to find their wives
tired out with housework, desperate be
cause the chimney refused to draw, their
hands cut and polled with chopping wood,
bringing in coal and carrying out ashes.
Such a condition of things is fearfully
hard on the wife, and also most distress
ing to the husband. Is it any wonder
that young men quail at such a prospect,
and fail to muster up their courage "to
the sticking point" of matrimony?
But yetâ lsn't that a pity? Of course it
le. And it is a blessing that so much of
this drudgery can be overcome by the
modern appliances to use with gas or
with electric power that the young man
need no longer fear to "put his fortune to
the touch." '
No girl that is worth anything would
hesitate now to undertake to do her own
housework In the beginning of her mar
ried life in a modest little flat. The work
Is trifling as far as what is called
"housework" goes. And in the cooking
all the hard points are eliminated and
only the pleasant ones left. â¢ Â»
No kindling to chopâ no coal to carry â
no ashes to take awayâ and no dirt to
clean upâ only a match to light, and then
comes the pleasure of making something
good to eat.
Perhaps some years ago the labor and
the dirt would not only have been dis
.tresslng, but actually impossible to over
come, even If the task were begun with
the most courageous intentions in the
world. Even If health did not prevent
the undertaking at the outset, it might
naturally give way under the strain and
the little home might be leluctantly given
up. The old saying, "When poverty
walks tn at the door, love nies out of the
window," is a sadly true one. Boarding-
L house life is not healthful for young peo
; pie in any way.
But now, .1 know several young girls
who are happily married to young doc
tors and business men whose careers are
enly Just beginning, and they have not
hesitated to undertake the housekeeping
â¢without maid or servant of any kind.
And they not only feel able to conduct
their own menage, but they have no
hesitation In attempting to entertain their
friends in a simple way, which, by the
way, is also the most agreeable way for
all.
Does the young bride make up a little
party for bridge whist some evening, she
knows, of course, that an Invitation for
tin evening at bridge implies some kinu
of a supyer when the games are over.
But fhe is not dismayed, for among her
wedding gifts was- an electric chafing
dish, capable of almost any culinary deli
cacy. All that is now required Is a few
bottles of blue ribbon beer, a bit of cheese
and some crackers. " and in a few min
utes-her friends arc gathered around the
dining table, eating a delicious -We|sh
rarebit..
All modern flats and apartments are
furnished with electric light, and it is
the easiest thing in the world to con
mct It by a plug to the chafing dish.
There is no alcohol to be spilled, no wick
to be hunted up and cut, and no resultant
odor. The dish is a beautiful table orna
ment, making the table look inviting arid
attractive?, and the heat from the electric
fixture will be sufficient to cook anything
that I* wanted. All the capabilities of the
most accomplished chafing dish are there,
and all easily and quickly developed from
the electricity of the chandelier. Not only
Welsh rarebit, but oysters a la poulette,
creamed crab, a slice or two of venison
with a little Jelly and a bit of paprika- in
the gravy and many other possibilities are
attainable at short notice and with little
or no trouble.

Mr. Wiedenthal of, the WiederitbaJ-

vcnlence.

the hair is somewhat exhausting. One is
fatigued after it " all, whether : the â¢ pro
cess is self-inflicted or performed by. a
maid, and It Is generally, desirable. to rest
for some; little: time after it. \u25a0 ~ *
One which particularly appeals to me
is the electric curling Iron. L.ucky,j are
the girls whose hair is naturally wavy-In
these days, when M. Marcel has made the
ondulee hair so fashionable. But most of
us need the assistance of a curling Iron,
and now' we have a little machine that in
sures peace of mind. We see light ahead.
A certain little electric machine will heat
our curling irons for us in no time at. all,
and there will be no deposit* of hiirfp
black or smoke upon them, and, indeed,
no delay and no worry, of any kind.:
One of the illustrations shows the curl-,
ing iron as it is actually used.
The young matron' has Just .washed her
hair, and dried " It ; : wlth Â« the * electric fan

The electric bag consists of resistance
coils incased in thick felt, and is connect
ed with the chandelier by. a plug at the
end of a lamp cord. Turn on the electricity
and the bed is so.on warmed, and the
heat will last until it is turned off. This
new Invention will be a blessing to those
who suffer from cold feet.
There are other things, too, where there
is electricity in the houseâ many 'conve
niences, too many, in fact, to enumerate
them all. '
The drawbacks to its use are well
known also. Just at the time It is needed
the water may not be running hot. which
means heating more water in the kettle
or over the alcohol lampâ a good deal of
trouble and an inadequate supply of hot
water. And then one is never sure of the
conduct of the hot ' water bag. It may
leakâ in facOit is very apt to leakâ and
before the night Is half gone it has relin
quished its Job and turned cold and
clammy.
But the electric bag never leaks and
never gives up. It insures sleep on the
coldest nights and carries comfort and
ease to the invalid.
There is a smaller electric, water heater
for the wash basin, which is, of course,
a luxury. The greatest wonder of , all,
perhaps, is the electrically heated bag for
the bed. This is to take the place of the
ordinary hot water bag", which frequently
leaks and rapidly gets cold.-. '<
On a cold night a hot water bag is a
very comforting article, even to those
who are in perfect health. But for an in
valid it is indispensable. All the hospitals
use them constantly for all their patients.
In fact, the use of hot water bags is too
general to require more than the mention
of the fact;
have found It hard to believe that hot
water could be had at any hour of the
day or night by the simple process of
turning on a switch.
The machine itself is quite small. It
is mounted on a piece of marble, about
sixteen inches in height by six inches
in width, and can be directly connected
with the water pipe at the bath tub.
If a hot bath is desired, all that it is
necessary to do is to turn on the colÂ« 3
water and then pull up the switch, and
in a minute the cold water is running
hot â so hot that it cannot be borne.
Every one knows the luxury of a hot
bath and everybody appreciates the an
noyance of the pseudo Hot bath, neither
hot nor cold, with none of the invigor
ating qualities of a cold bath and none
of the refreshing and cleansing quali
ties of the hot one.
WHAT with the multitude of
things that can be done with
N gas anil electricity, -the mod
ern housekeeper can offer only
very lame excuses for. any
errors that she may make. With so much
that Is arranged for her convenience and
assistance, she can hardly complain of
being tired cut, or out of sorts. Her
servants are gas and electricity, and t!ie
appliances that are made nowadays for
them do a.n Immense deal to Mshtcn la
bor and to overcome dirt.
J.sfoor and Girt. .
Just think of it! Think what a tre
mendcus advance It is in science to light
en labor and abolish dirt. It Is almost as
great as making two blades of crass
grow where only one grew before. And
it is proverbial that whoever can accom
plish that is the true benefactor of man
kind.
Among a multitude of possibilities, prob
ably the most interesting equation that
these twin. ."slaves of the lamp" help to
solve is the matrimonial equation. They
make a marriage possible now that would
have been practically impossible before.
For no young man wants to marry. and
turn his bride into a household drudge
before the honeymoon is over. And young
men do want to marry and do waul their
time when a chafing /dish delicacy
"pleases i. the palate and â¢ inspires the
soul" of man. more 'than -a. dull- and
sordid roast. \u25a0 ' ' t
Bat men are not the only people In
the world. Our sex here has aÂ» right
to be considered also, though perhaps
not with so special , a\u25a0\u25a0 reference to
grosser feeding as the other. sex. One
of the special privileges of the ladies,
which, by the way, we are always glad
to share with the men. is our after
noon tea. \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0,' J ;-"â¢
It was fcr our special behoof, I tnlnK,
that Sydney Smith said:
"Thank God for tea! What would
the world do without It? I am glad
I was not born before tea!" . \u0084
That sentiment was uttered a great
many years ago. but the echo of it
has gone on and still rings true and
clear. In fact, the afternoon tea is now
almost as fully established with us as
with the English. /
Eut the tea n?ust be good to be really
enjoyed. The water must be boiling
hot to make really good v tea. /I- And; it
often happens that with a. decadent fire
in the stove the water is'- not hot
enough, and the result is "peevishness."

The hot May sun streamed down on
him. She could see his great chest rising
and falling:, and the muscles of his arms
working, under' the* worn sleeves of his
shirt.: ..;,'\u25a0
"You have more than your share of the

her again. A stray sunbeam glinted on
her needleâ an Idle needle Just then. "And

The scarlet blotches faded in her
cheeks. 'She picked up her sewing'
again, but the hands trembled over the
coarse cotton cloth. She could not ply
the glittering little implement : she
held. Suddenly she went deathly pale.
She lay back, drawing her. breath' ln
short, soft gasps:
"Mother!" cried the young fellow. .
"Mother!"
"It's nothing," she panted. "Nothing."
\u25a0 But her; lips -took on a bluish tinge,
and after a faint shiver she lay quite
still. He dashed out to the well for
water, brought it to her, forced her to
swallow It. He watched her anxiously,
all his sullenness gone, as she shud
dered back to consciousness.
"I didn't mean to rile you, mother,"
he said. .. "But seem like; I couldn't
to have you comin" between {'Chastina an' !
me."
He had dropped on one knee beside her
chair in a bewilderment jof .dumb, and

'Copyright by S. S. McClure Company.)
..^ v OU going in town. Dan?" ques
/ I tioned the woman. Her voice
{ 1 was appealing.
The young fellow standing in
*\u25a0"\u25a0\u25a0* the doorway 6hiftcd his posi
tion impatiently. He was C 3, tall and
brawr.y. Years of labor on the farm had
developed his limbs and toughened his
muscles. Later in life he would be etooped
and shambling, as are those who follow
the plow and guide the harrow after the
days of youthful manhood have passed.
Now he was straight and stately, and the
colossal symmetry of his frame waa good
to look upon. His cotton shirt, falling
loose at the neck, revealed a triangle of
sunburnt skin. His low-browed, strong
featured face was coppered also. The
Jaw was heavyâ the chin square. The
blue tyes he turned on the woman had the
eullenne&s of one who expects opposition.
"Yes. I'm a-goin\"
"In the new buggy?"
He nodded. There- was a silence which
the waited wistfully for him to break.
As he said nothing, she picked up the
Ecwing which lay in her lap.
"I was hoping I could get to go," she
eaid. speaking in the plaintive monotone
produced by colorless years of self-repres
sion and self-denial.* "I've besn every
time when I could take or leave the chil
dren. It's a year since I've been to town."
Her needle was suspended. She looked
afar over the boundless expanse of prairie
with weary eyes. "My father and brother
are buried on the hill there. Little Ruby
âshe's there, too. She died when she
wasn't but eight. She was the greatest
child for flowers! The weeds even were
flowers to her. I guess she'd know If
there were some put on her grave."
Again there was silence, she sending him
eager, furtive glances; he staring out
where an ocean of oats tossed turbu
lcntly in the glaring sunshine.
"xnere's so many folks in town- It s
sociable like. There hasn't been a soul
to. this house since Christmas. Then It
was only some campers whose wagon
broke down. But it seemed good to see
them, even.'*
"Look here, mother," he broke out, "I
know you ain't got much pleasure. Fd
like you could ax to go. But as for me
drivin" you inâ well, I promised to take
Chastina Marks." . . -
She said nothing, but the look that
quivered out on her face made him 'set
' Jiip teeth hard for an Instant. Then, with
a scarlet blotch burning on either thin
cheek, she took up her sewing again, and
went on stitchingâ stitching.
The home of the Carneys was a for
lorn place. There was no timber in that
region. The small, shabby house perched
upon the bluff was exposed to the bitter
winds of winter and to the almost malig
nant furnace blasts of summer. It -was
liineteen years since Oliver Carney had
married for the second time. Then he
und his two sturdy boys had sadly needed
the ministrations of a woman. The girl
he married was young and romantic. STie
pitied him. She mistook her exquisite
j^ympathy for the divine passion . itself.
When he traded his business in the East
\u0084I'or a. rocky Nebraska farm and went to
live where his lack of experience and
the capricious climatic conditions togeth
er conspired against him the outcome
v.as despondency and futile regret. He
not only failed to do one thing well; he
succeeded In doing many things HL He
credited Fate with peculiar perversity
toward himselfâ with an almost personal
antagonism. Dyspepsia, that- grim demon
evoked by farmhouse viands, became a
constant torment. Insomnia duly fol
lowed. Pessimism, the prompt handmaid
Â©f these, waited upon them. So he be
came gloomy and unreasonable, except
when his depression was temporarily
merged in the maudlin amiability of
liquor.
It was upon the woman, however,
that the burdens of failure pressed
most heavily. She had been a brave
and gallant young creature, but the
cowardice and shirking selfishness of
the man she married ate into- the core
of her being like an acid.
None know bettor than she that work
long before light on winter morns
and from the first streak of pearl in
cummer skies was hard. She knew that
poverty was a rabid, a relentless thing.
She knew that it made petty those who
would be great and generous; that it
fettered hands which would fain be ex
tended in royal: generosity; that none
might scale its ramparts which barred
out possible ambitions â pleasures â
Joys! But these she accepted â the pov
erty and the toil. At the melancholy
cf inertia surrounding her she rebelled.
-She dreaded "its contagion. She refused
to have her heritage of 'hope wrested
from her. She would not live in an
atmosphere of rayless foreboding. She
denied the right of one man to condemn^
her' to. profound and enduring discontent. Â£
She was JÂ»ot one of those who succumb ?.
to adVerfity willingly. So she made a>:
hard fight- Occasionally ehe conqueredâ v
less frequently as the years went by. j;
The struggle told on her. She lost ex-y
pectancy of expression and elasticity of
ctep. Child-bearing: and child-rearing
were part of her handicapped existence.
Now a fresh fear had arisen. What if
Dan -were to marryâ Dan, upon whom
they all depended, rather than upon the
moping, misanthropic father!
"Dan!". Her voice sounded strange; to
herself, and she waited until she could
epeak as usual. "Dan, what would we
nil do without your* *
She had beÂ«n a school teacher in her
youth, and she spoke with a correctness
and a' precision which, although marred
by occasional idioms, still distinguished
her speech from the lingual slovenliness
of the Western farm woman.
"Oh, I guess you'd git along!" A dull,
slow color had crept into hie face. "It's
goin* to be a good year. Dick could take
my place."
Dickâ takeâ his place! He v.as thinking,
thenâ be was going to
"Weâ we can't depend on Dick!" she
murmured. A vision of Dick rose before
herâ gay, pleasure-lov'ng, inconsiderate
Dkk! She smiledâ a sad smile. "I didn't
Think Chistina was the kind of girl you'd
tii'j.e a fancy to, Dan."
He swung around.
â¢WhÂ»l." he demanded, "have, you got
agjn her?"
Her work fell on her lap. She clasped
her thin, knobby- jointed hands upon it
and looked up at her stepson. She was
a frail lit tie body, gowned " in the ever
lasting print wrapper of the prairie
housekeeper. ' Her large nazel eyes were
brightâ too bright. She breathed quickly.
She, had lost two of her front teeth. To
have ihpm replaced would be an extrava
gance not to be considered. " Frequently
when speaking she lifted her hand with
a nervous gesture and covered her mouth.
"She's frivolous. Dan. She likes admira
tionâand pretty clothes â --"- â¢_ \u25a0 :
"Is that all? What girl don't, mother?"
"it ecems to me,*' she went on hur
riedly, "that yourâ your marriage to : her
would be aâ a mistake! Think It over
a bitâ -" ..-".'
"Think it over!" he burst out. 'â¢Mother,
you didn't use to want to stand In. my

In. the middle ot the doth, you can guard I
against letting the excelsior get acat- '

sides of the muslin should be often lifted
and every bit of the excelsior shaken,
well toward the middle. Each barrel,
when tilled, should bÂ« sent below; either

be too convenient for reckless ones who
\u25a0 drop matches about broadcast. (The

Economy of a Oust Pan.
From start to finish, in house settling
a3 well as ever afterward, a dustpan
and whisk broom should be kept on ev
ery' tloor ready for use. ' The novae
where the pan and brush are promptly
used for keeping clean will not need to
be swept-- an over iiuir so often aa one
where everything is left for "sweeping
day." A good old housekeeper used to
say. "I'd rather have one keep clean
than ever so many cleanings." That is
the secret. Never allow things to ba
topsy-turvy while you are settling or
at any time afterward. This advice be- 1

The mistress of the house herself, wnea
in the midst of all the work and fatigued ,
with her crowding cares, would often
prater to take some refreshment almost
anywhere in her own house- to going
out.
A nice, clean kitchen, with a tidy cook
serving everything piping hot. is far
preferable to the average restaurant
with strange people eatiny all about one
and everything served lukewarm on cold
dishes in a. atmosphere. In fact,
the only hot things uue gets in an aver
age restaurant is the air . thai all are
compelled to breather
Supplies of milk, butter, eggs and
fruit. -as well *as groceries, ought to be,
provided early. In order . to remember
everything it is a good plan to take the
grocer's catalogued list; with that before*
you there will be little danger of -over- â¢
looking or forgetting what you are la
the haoit of using on your table; but. In
the beginning, avoid. all foods that take
much time in their preparation, for you
want all the help you can have to get
settled and in order.
"When, as in tbc case of large fish,
such as cod, halibut, sturgeon, sal
mon, etc., the sections of the body
are offered to the purchaser, one
Brest look to the texture of tho
flesh. Soft fisL is always unsafe
food. The fibre should be distinct,
the fiakes firm, the color. pure.
As 6oon as the fish is brought
home after it is purchased, it should
be placed upon the ice, not left in
the hot kitchen to await the cook's
convenience. Before leaving her
hands after she has received it from
the iishman or errand boy it should
go into the refrigerator. Kegiect
of this rule has ruined many a fine
mess of fish-
Once upon the ice, it should stay
there until preparation for cooking
it immediately has been made.
Drawn from icy security, it should
be washed quickly and wiped, never
left to soak and soften, even in iced
water.
I recall now but one exception to
this rule. Sturg-on is less oily and
rank, r.nd the tough flesh is made
tender, not flabby, if laid for an
hour in iced water before it is
cooked. Market men keep their
fish almost at a freezing tempera
ture. This fact emphasizes the dan
per of leaving it even for a fewmin-
P***es in a warmer place.

Soft Fish Net Safe.
IF THE average native house
keeper comprehended thor
oughly the nutritive and eco
nomic values of fish', the great
American meat bill would be cut
down to at least two-thirds of its
present proportions. Wo eat -sore
meat and less sea, lake and river
food than any other nation upon the
face of the globe.
I have explained briefly in a for
mer chapter why fish deserves a
more honorable place upen the fam
ily bill of fare than it ncv enjoys.
One reason why it is undervalued,
if not distrusted, by many careful
domestic caterers is the general im
pression that much of the fish- of
fered for sale in our markets is not
quite fresh. T c least intelligent
reader of the daily newspaper
knows of and dreads the name of
"ptomaine poisoning."
The first essential, then, to be
considered in the selection of fish
is that it shall bÂ« fresh. It behooves
our housewifo to learn how to sat
isfy herself on this point.
One may judge of the time that
the whole fish has been exposed in
the shambles or packed away in
boxes by the color of the gill* and
the brightness or dullness 01 the
eyes.
The tnYLs -.hould show a bright
blood color, instead of the dim ma
roon betraying lhat the fish has been
a. long time out of his native ele
ment. The eves should be clear and
crystalline, in opposition to the
filmy, opaque appearance which has
given occas: -a for the term "fish
eyed."

a good many years. Such little points
. are easily forgotten if one docs not g?

things about .which It is most mortify
ing to make a mistake. There Is' a
great deal of truth in the old cynicism
that society pardons a crime much mure
readily than a blunder. r v
. .All invitations can be roughly divid
ed into two classes, formal and informal.
Formal invitations are engraved or writ
ten, es the case may be, while the lat
ter, sort arc- either given verbally or
consist of cordial little notes written in
the first. person.
For balls and dances, as a general
rule, great formality is observed In thr
invitations, -which, unless the affair is
to be very small and quiet, are gen
erally engraved and sent out from ten
days to two weeks in advance.
Invitations. to Public Balls,
i'he very stateliest md most formal
of ail invitations are those issued for big
public balls or club dances. The word
ins, with slight variations, usually runs
as follows:

Answering Invitations to Private
Dances.
The two usual forms of invitation to
private balls and dances are given fully
in Chapter VII, ."Going; to a Dance," so
they will' not be "included here. They
should be answered as follows: **-
15 Prospect Street,
Mr. and Mrs. \u25a0 James : Brown 'accept'
wlth-pleasure Mrs. John Montmorency's
kind invitation for Thursday evening,
*Â»ir. find Mrs. James 'Brown regret
sincerely their inability to accept Mrs
John Monimorency's kind Invitation for
Thursday evening, February the ninth.
Either an acceptance or-regfet"to an
Invitation, of this sort should be sent
promptly, a delay of a day or two be
ing all that Is permissible.
Invitations to Husbands and Wives.
A- wife always acknowledges .invita
tions for herself or , her^ husband, and
either accepts or. declines for them both
together. But if/ a, married .woman de
sires very much-toÂ»accept*an\invitatlon '
to a private dance and her husband is
unable to accompany "her, she may, if :
she knows the hostess 'well?" send' her a
regret to the festivity/explaining her
reason. Then the lady who is * giving
the dance may, if she wishes. Invite' the ;
wife" alone."The same rule "applies* to a'
husband whose wife Is unable .to accept.;
This may be done for a dance, which Is
a more or less elastic i function." but for
Â«: dinner or theatre^ party,'^ where It is
absolutely necessary to have the. same
number of men and ..women,: such a
course Is never relished by the hostess.

AT THE end of his third raonth the
baby ought to be vaccinated by a
physician. Infants are. likely to
.contract smallpox. If exposed,
-and every. baby. should be vaccinated as
a- precautionary ; measure. It Is
well to have; the vaccination over before
the baby begins 'to cut his teeth. *\u25a0
:, Opinions differ as to whether the baby
'should tie: vaccinated Sn his arm or leg;
in. little "girls the. scar "on 'the arm Is
often, objected to. .Before children can
walk about, liprefer tovaccinate them

. ful to 'the ; child iwhen^it Is necessary , to
.handle the sore member in dressing and
undressing. If done on the leg, the outer
slde^of^tha calf _ should be chosen. -.â¢
A .' mother i should never try to vacci
nate her own child â¢' nor allow . anyone
else ,tb- do so except a, physician.. Per
fectly [, fresh, .^>ure virus should
be used; usually In. two. or three days
the vaccination will show signs of "talc
ing," and by the fifth or sixth day a
well-defined vesicle will be seen. A clean
piece of soft linen should bo kept over
the spot, and held In place by a gauze
bandage. This dressing must be
changed every day or two. If there Is
much Inflammation, the linen may be
wet . with boric-acid solution or other
antiseptic wash ordered by the doctor.
If the linen sticks to the sora badly, a
little carbolized vaseline or a'Uttl*
borlc-acld powder may be used.
The ' little scab which forms usually
stays on about three weeks, and then
drops off. leaving a scar underneath. â If
vaccination shields are worn.they should
b^e of the kind which resemble corn plas
ters and are* open at, the top.' They are
made of felt and have a large holÂ» cut
In the centre. Some babies do not seem
to mind the " vaccination in the least,
while others are fretful, and have more
or less fever at .times, but the disturb

-WHO ONCE. - SHARED .THE
THROXE OF NAPLES.
PARTfI, Aug. - tLâ That great ' industrial
crisis reigning to Europe and thought by
â¢ome American writers to be. imminent
In the United States has attracted the at
tention ct M. Jules Meline, Premier un
der Felix Fanre and now one of the most
distinguished members of the French Sen
ate. The question, according to JM. Me
llne. Is a serious one, since all countries
and all classes are or will - be affected
unless something be done to stem the
tide of Industrial overproduction and agri
cultural neglect which -has become the
order of the day. M. Meline has made a
life-long ' study of this ' subject and his
authority is considered greater than that
Â«f any other mim in France.'
M. Meline . ha* a decided objection to
Interviews, ; and on only two occasions
In the sixty-Mven years ' of â¢ his life -has
he allowed a Journalist to approach .him.
The Importance of the subject now pre
occupying him, however, and' the' interest
which* he takos in . the American ' aspect
Induced â¢ him to '\u25a0 make the , third excep
tion. , \u25a0 .'....;'â ',- '- .'
"Toe situation ' threaten* not only the
prosperity.' of countries depending; upon a
fcÂ»r division of their productive forces,
but the . exJcteaoe of . laborers," < said M.
Mi>i<no- , â¢Â«TnÂ«re .Is , room for every one
under the sun, but on conditions* of bhar
lnjr up the good things .of the earth in
stead of concentrating- - upon one depart
ment of activity. ,- While manufactories
have been overworked, agriculture has
been left aside. The time has come to
Â« restore the world's compromised' eco
.otfmlcal equilibrium and to ~ warn men
{Away from the beaten roÂ«d where those
â¢trugsllcg for wealth . are already being
crushed from sheer, weight of number."
AMERICA AND JAPAN." r '
"In Europeâ and in America 7" "
The United States seems to be the
nation predestined to set. the' salutary
example of turning once again to' the
earth. Their people are exceptionally
favored in having at their disposal vast
extents of fertile territory. Further
more, their consumers already suffice
to. absorb the better part of their agri
cultural production. They ; alone have
both the facility and the versatility re
quired to operate the evolution."" ' \
â¢Then Europe alone is imperiled r*
â¢*The lack of proportion existing, be
tween industrial and agricultural pro
duction is, it must be admitted, a'com
plaint Peculiar to the Ola World," said
M. Meline. "The Xew World, where the
EOII Is rich and there are home needs
still'' to 'be -filled, appears to be but of
dansrer-^-excepting the United; States, j
Even there, however, confidence can be
r**tored by careful study, for while they ;
may be ruined abroad, they, can never .
be ..ruined at home. Feeling the ap- "i
jiroach of the storm from Europe 'and
eeeing that markett there were too well '
Vjpj> lle d, "Americans . lost no .time in <
'â¢eeklng another outlet In Asia. .They j
have already taken there a"- firm foot
ing, which the opening of the Panama
canal will improve.
"With" the exception of her morning rides
in the Saint Germain Forest and her rare
strolls . in ': Paris , and her occasional ap

stltuted for the hand of man.' when trans-',

simple and economical, the petty markets
scattered over the world^were- drawn- to
gether in a single vast' mart.
"The first nation to profit by, the appli
cation of steam was England, which na
ture \u25a0 had supplied most abundantly with
iron to build engines \u25a0 and coal * to , feed
them. Having no J rival ff either mr ;the
cheapness of production or ;in, the^ quail-"
ty of workmanship, she became the, great
purveyor of the^world. It was only after
the j Franco-Prussian war. that other ' na-,
tions determined to create manufactories
of their own, erecting ."customs, barriers
to protect their nascent' industry 'against
England. Tbej United adopted' the
radical measure of prohibitive protection.

\ IN> PETTICX)ATS. '
The passing of William Adolphe
Bougucreau, the French painter, has
demonstrated why artists in San Fran
cisco are such proficient knockers.
It has always passed me why, if there
were any definite basic laws ! governing
art, that one. artist would pronounce a
picture good and another pronounce it
bad. each explaining explicitly just why
his opinion was formed. .
Now : the whole matter seems to re
solve Itself into the personality of the
painter, the way he sees things, and
the masterâ or the Idealâ he has set
himself to follow.
That picture, then, which meets his.
conceptions, is a good picture; or if
It be palpably faulty in drawing, or a
visible crime In color,. he will declare
It still to show merit. : ,
And thus are opinions of paintings
+\u25a0 largely measured by . the critic's own
" preconceived , notions of what , constl
, tutes art â and it is as variable, as; are
the temperament* and educations of

Clears Feline Tribe From House the
King Lent Her nnd Wins the
Uarra's Disapproval.
LONDON, Aug. 26.â Consuelo, Duchess
of Manchester, like Lord Roberts, has a
strong aversion to catsâ and particularly
cat concerts. When she went recently
into residence sat White Lodge.
Richmond. which the King' has
loaned to her. she found, numer
ous families of the feline tribe domiciled
there. She endured many sleepless hours
through their nocturnal disputations and
at last she made up her mind to get rid of
them. She J consulted the butler. That
functionary reminded her that Queen
Alexandra was a cat lover and that when
ever she honored White Lodge with her
presence she always visited the "cattery."
which Is situated In a remote corner of
the stable yard.
"I would not like to do anything that
would annoy Queen Alexandra," said the
Duchess, "but my health is worth more
to me than all the cats in Europe and I
am not going to put up with this eternal
noiae all night." "Then they must be de
stroyed, your Grace," responded the but
ler apologetically. The Duchess medi
tated for a moment and remembered that
sho was a liberal contributor to the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals- "They must not be destroyed,
butler," she said, "I am a subscriber to
the home for lost and straying animals.
Send them on to the Cats' Home.' I may
not be here very long and then the poor
things can come back if they are alive."
When Queen Alexandra heard the story
she remarked that the lata Duchess of
Teck who had long occupied White
Lodge, was a most Irritable woman with
regard to anything that disturbed her
rest, and that she had never heard her
complaining of the cats. "Tne Duchess
of Teck was a very heavy sleeper." re
torted the American Duchess, "but un
fortunately I am very easily awakened."
The cats, sixty-two in all, left, White
Lodge In a body, and tho King heard
with no little satisfaction that they had
all been cleared out. for he does not
share his royal consort's fondness for
domesticated felines, and would much.re
joice if they could similarly be got rid of
at all the royal residences.

obols a head, and all 'the latest music.
Perhaps we first haven't an Aeschylus
among us, nor aâ who ; was the Grecian
Bach? But who more worthy to sit
with the Greeks "than a George Sterling?
She argued, looking like a cherub asking
you to stroke Its wings. "But the people
who know, don't they know how transi
tory It all is, the joy, the pain?"
"Mostly how transitory their own Joy
and the other men's pain," I thought.
Miss Albertson did say that she would
like to play Juliet, La Tosca, Magda, but
not Camllle; that she was Just groping
her way yet In her work; that (very seri
ously) she liked it very, very much. But
it was the small sage In Arrah's rosy
petticoat that quite confounded me. Mrs.
Denis O'Sullivan, painter, playwright,
etc., etc., who was femininely occupied in
the next room with a needle and a bit of
Mr. Denis* lingerie, will tell you so. And
Miss AlbertÃon's stockings are not even
the merest, palest blue.
Her "No, ma'am," was startling in its
complete conviction. "It is best to have
the thrills." Then she said, and I knew
I had the creed of the girl, "But, I want
to know. Even if it brings pain I want to
know. I'm willing to pay, but I am going
to know. Do you think, anyway, that
there Is very much pain for thej people
who do know?"
Yes, I did.
She did, she said, and uncannily asked:
"Have you ever noticed how soon they go
when you begin to analyze them?"
"You have?" I parried. "But is It
worth it?"
But Miss Albertson, like the -immortal
Budge and Toddle, went on: "If she ever
had that thing, where has It gone? Per
haps it is still there, and age and ills of
body dull the power of obeying the sub
jective, order?"
Darting. up to the call then, she dashed
some . powder^ on' her' cheeks with: . "I
want to.be a little here â I've had
trouble, don't; you know, since the last
act!'' .And in her Red : Rldinghood cape
she tripped, off to' Join, Shaun in his
prison.
Tears again, as she came back.
"Where do they come from?" I asked
In turn, "or do you analyze your own
thrills?" '-'I-} >~ C. ,
She came back with this: "When one Is
most emotional, one is not, always most
impressive. I remember once going to see
a woman who had lost her husband. She
was In fearful grief and I was Intensely
sorry for her. But I watcned her to see
how Bhe did itâ wasn't it shameful of
me?" Chin in hand, looking at me from
under her snooded hair like a child, she
asked this. "But I couldn't help it. And
âisn't this terrible?â it was funny! Acted
upon the stage, as she acted it In real
life, the scene would have been only
funny."
Conscious! I had said of Miss Albert
son's acting that It was "conscious."
How under the glittering' sun. I won
dered now could it fall of being con
scious? Her bent of mind is exactly
that which De Maupassant deplores in
himself â the critical consciousness
that may not take a kiss from the
beloved without criticizing the fitness,
the artistry of it; that catalogues, ana
lyzes, every thrill. Moreâ much "more
â I saw of this in this unusual young
person. And it Is a temperament "yet
unawakened; it Is a self-consciousness
coexistent with an extraordinary emo
tional naivete, and one, wonders just
what will happen when the awakening
comes.
We went back to the question of
brains upon the stage.
"I know people of exceptional intel
lect," she was saying 1 , "who are posi
tively grotesque when it comes to ex
pressing emotion â of the pathetic kind
â we'll say. They do it all from the
head â from the objective mind; don't
give the subjective- mind any say. Then
there are those that â did you ever see
Clara Morris?" â¢
I had not.
"I saw her." the young critic went
on. "latels r in 'The Two Orphans.' That
was the only time I ever saw her. But
through- reading about her I had the
Impression that , she had dominated hex
audience by a certain emotional frenzy
hysteria. When I saw her" (solemnly
the golden eyes regarded me) "she' was
pitifully futile. Her voice was like
thisâ" (by the Albertson voice flat as
the clatter of a bad dollar), "she shook
her hands like thisâ the old, bad way.
All the temper seemed to have gone
out of the work, all that before had
magnetized the audience. But how can
she write as she does? What does one
write with? Isn't it the same thing?"
"Spare me. Helen's Baby," I laughed.
effective when one 'sniffs'?" I had heard
not.
"You shouldn't tell me before company,"
laughed the girl, and as Shaun the Post's
caubeen disappeared she said: "I forgot
my lines, last night, and I asked Mr.
O'Sulllvan, 'What do I say here?* He said.
'I don't know, say it!" I was Just too
happy to act! Good-bye, for a minute."
But she couldn't find the bank notes
that the McCoul gives her! She split the
rouge, powdered the table, tossed books
aside, but no bank notes. With brilliant
presence of mind I snatched up some
sheets of copy paper, folded them, gave
them to her and, as J. J. Morton would
betray it, "they weren't bank notes at
all. at all. that Arrah had. I saw them;
they were Just sheets of Call copy paper!"
Perhaps it was the aftermath of the
"VVearin* of the Green" that I beard a
moment later, but Miss Albertson came
back wiping the tears from her eyes.
"Real tears!"
"Oh, I never lose a chance to sniff,"
she tossed back.
I wondered innocently: "Is one most
"I thinkâ one actsâ mostlyâ from the
subjective side?" she queried, of herself,
of me, of the powers about. "It is an
instinctive rather than a conscious art â
usually? One acts without reason. In
tellectâfrom intuition? There should be
bothâ yet? You know (she clasped her
hands cozily about her knees to this) I
think If I could trust wholly to my intui
tion I should act better? But my Judg
ment seems to sit upon my intuition. My
objective mind steps in and says: 'don't
do this, don't do that'â that my intuition
tells me to do. Then there's trouble, and
I don't know what to do. Possibly when
my objective mindâ"
"Colleen, dear" (it was in Denis O'Sul-
Hvan's ingratiating baritone, and Denis
O'Sullivan's big, beaming face followed
the voice), "d'ye remember \u25a0where you
dried up last night?"â " How d'ye do?" to
the visitor.
"Brains?" she repeated after me.
â¢brains most essential to success on the
stage?" She dropped her chin in her
hand, looked at me from under her
snooded hair like a child, and said: "Oh
no. I dcn't believe brains are the chief
factor in a stage success. Personality
first, I think, temperament, sincerity, and
a. little intellectâ eh?"
I held my breath and nodded to a "Per
haps.".
Miss Albertson went on, question In her
voice alwaysâ she is anything less than
dogmatic; "Actors so often express great
er things than they are capable of con
ceiving?" '
1 threw in another "perhaps." and
asked. carefully grave, "what she
thought the source of the acting faculty?"
About her horse â Pere Albertson "raises
horses"â she has a "fine little pacer,"
about her dogâ she KNEW "I should have
.â¢Us if I saw him" (he is so beautiful);
about how she could not play the night
before, "Just because 6he wae so happy,"
â¢â¢all about, nothing," we -bad been-chat
ting.
Truth to tell, I went to see Lillian Air
bertson the other night as just a pretty
girl that had achieved a neat little suc
cess in the four years since she- was. a
high school lass in Fresno. Raisins and
profane thermometers had failed to sat
isfy her, it is surmised, and she left
Fresno for Frisco and fogs. She "want
ed to know." she told me. At home' she
told themi that she foifnd It imperative
to earn her own living. Three days'
clerking in an uptown store decided her
that that was not the way she wanted
to earn it. And bo Miss Albertson took
to the stage. I happened to know of
the grit that had gone to the getting
there, and to have followed her in the
by no means great, by no means sensa
tionally promising, but sincere, earnest,
pretty work that has now earned her a
handsome berth with the Lieblers.
And here she was talking about objec
tive minds and subconsciousnesses and
things. I began it. A little wickedly I
began It, asking the golden-eyed girl, in
the foolishly pretty costume of Arrah na
Pogue (it was \in her dressing-room at
the Grand Opera-house) what she thought
most essential to success on the sage.
Brains?
But I stopped at the chin. "Tis an in
quisitive chin. You don't get -Miss Al
bertson's kind of chin on the person that
doesn't ask her way when she wants
a way and there Is some one to ask.
Deep and firm, it rounds delicately to a
point. \ and if the Albertson nose did the
same one would prefer to ; have on this
year's , rather than last year's hat when
their owner said "how-d'ye-do?" But it
does not. It is only the legitimate curi
osity, the thirst to know, that the chin
bespeaks, and, by the gods, did never
chin less belie its mistress! There was
after all some warrant here for my
doubting the hue of the hose. .
Miss . Albertson's stockings were In
dubitably white. I had to look several
times to reassure myself on the point.
'They were virgin white, nipped in to a
neat young ankle, and disappearing into
a small, bright-buckled, red-heeled shoe.
The rose-ringed skirt of Arrah na Pogue
hid the other end of them, and they
gleamed white to the hem of it A
rounded slip of warm young .womanhood,
round . of arm, round of warm, white
throat, round of cheek brightened above
that, all girlish and naive as the snowy
hose. There was a. broad, young brow,
laid over with low, soft, coppery folds
of hair, eyea like a deer's with the sun
in themâ why shouldn't the stockings be
white?

and presumably in character. Perhaps
.though. Count Boni wouldn't be such a
bad fellow if he had money enough to*
gratify his ancestral notion as to what
a Count is entitled to in the world; It Is
said he now wants- his wife, to -pungle
up the purchase price of a Paris news
paper, but Anna think 3 che -has "bought
him all the toys she can afford, and 1 curt
ly refuses. ,'
As to the distinguished Frenchman that
has won the fair Callfornlenne, he Is, said
to be a cultivated fellow and -with much
"go" in his make-up. And as much' ls.
said of his brother, he who assisted at
the service as best man. . â¢
By the way, did it ever' strike you
what a stupid expression, "best man" is?
Why, the best manâ as the bride knows
â is the groom. Now, why, pray, should
his honors be plucked by another?
Will some one kindly supply a term
more fit? - /
Her gown was a charmingly simple af
fair, the bodice being, of . the surplice
order, with a fall of rose point lace. A
notable feature of it was the absence of
It does look as though a pair thus
wedded were wedded "until death us do
part."
The bride, a well-bred,'wholesome
looking girl, with fine dark eyes and
hair, was one of the most composed
brides of the year, taking no Billy pains
to hide her face while passing from. her
carriage to the church.
There's no gainsaying that a nuptial
mass is the most solemn marriage ser
vice now in use, but It is lengthy, nec
essarily, and something of a trial to the
bride and groom. But It haa Its com
pensations in giving the sacrament of
matrimony a solemn and deeply im
pressive setting. <39flHH
I cannot recall a prettier wedding.
The presence of the servants, the vil
lagers and the bourgeoisie that lingers
late in the suburb gave to the payly
Kowned guests and the brilliant wed
ding party a fit background.-
It was Â«uch a wedding day aa women
dream of and brides pray for.. The sky
was fl>rkless, the air soft and warm,
nnd sweet, old-fashioned gardens gave
forth odors of lavender and verbena and
tioneyeuckle.
The o'ersaadowing event this week
in the ultra-smart set was, of course,
the SrrAS'.r.g of Miss Josephine de Gulgne
and Vicomte Philippe de Tristan-
It wm a great holiday in San Mateo,
where the bride has spent most of her
life â such a* wasn't spent abroad.

There's no gettine around the fact
that womcu of the stage (and inciden
tally not the Duss type), and women
on* don't meet in polite drawing
rooms, are bajrz-iap- some big matri
monial game â big from the world's
Riandpoint, which, of course, Is the
f.nanclal and social rating, not per
jtonaL
I>ong ago wives and clever maidens
made this discovery and forthwith Â»el
unit to discover the particular type of '
thann that waÂ« landing the big catches.
According to the Intelligence and
temperament of each were the deduc
tions made.
The charm was attributed variously
to the good figures and the good style
of the winning types; to their mag
netic personalities; to an abandon
ment of con\-entlonalities; to an under
standing of the weaknesses of men and
<-ateiing to them â these and many
other reasons were given for the ex
isting conditions.
It is perfectly troe that the captors
did not always become brides, but they
prevented other women from wedding, :
which condition is about as hopeless as ;
!f the eta !n the case were a benedict t
â slr.ee he Care not marry, even if he
wants to.
Now this condition of affairs has
1Â«: d to some rather weird deportment
on the part of some smart maids and
matrons, who nave reasoned to wrong
conclusions.
Having noted that many favorites of
men ersoke and drink and swear and
.tell risque tales â and not always pic
turesquely â they have adopted the
supposed indices of good fellowship,
with ail the hazytatmosphere that sur
rounds women of bent and punctured
reputation.
Of course there have always been
foolish virgins, and there will
t>Â» â cnf.il mothers grow wise enough
to instill an intelligent knowledge of
men and women â their weaknesses and
their strengths â In the minds of their
developing daughters, and explain to
them the qualities that really do ap- i
peal to men \u25a0worth the â¢winning.
- Knowing personally some of the girls
who co ihe-Â» foolish thir.es, in the be
lief that they are winning the regard
of men â and who have cultivated a
wondrous capacity for wine and high
balls ar.l doped cigarettes, I say.
"Don't."
The man for whose edlScatlon you do
thcue things Isn't worth the winning,
granted that you could win him by the
high-ball route. Having annexed you, a
man of that type would soon find It neces
cary to drink to the light of a new pair of
eyes, and the smile of other lija.
It would be but another case for the
matrimonial coroner, and It isn't worth
while.
Mind you, this sportive exterior of
[tbtm misguided maids is not necessarily
an evidence of immorality.
It is simply a pose.
A case in point occurred some months
tL/zo when an Eastern man was a guest at
a smart dinnc? at the Palace. Meeting
' him the day after the affair, he asked me
if 1 knew Mies .
"Yes, of course; she's a member of the
Orcenway Â»nd Arsrmbly dancing clubs,
and of mighty nice family. Wby7"â
calling up the roseate possibilities of a
"crush." a wooing, and a wedding.
"Weil, frankly, I'll toll you why." said
he. "She possesses all the evidences of a
woman of the night life. She could easi
ly have put me under the table. She
cmokc-d aa many cigarettes as I did, and
told talcs thatâ somehowâ gave me a lit
tle Jolt, and I'm no Dowie-that'fi-never
becn-kiKsed."
While taking his measure as a cad fl>ut
there surely were extenuating clrcum- !
stance?) I assured him that it was all j
a poseâ a mere bluff of the little girl' 3 j
under the impression that Fuch per- i
forroances were smart and supposedly in- ;
tercEUr.g, and that she had probably
punished herself to appear sophisticated
for his Â£i>'-oial entertainment.
I know that little goose was posing;
that she was creating: for herself an
atmosphere in which she didn't live, an<!
that she vms posing for a purpose Sfcf
was a little dunce who had reasoned
from false premises, and, of course,
came to worng- conclusions.
But what of the woman who, know
ing the law, pursues the same tactics?
Girls, if you only knew what the men
' said of you, even though they may ap
plaud you, you wouldn't do Itâ for the
cad aboundeth where you least expect
to find him, to publish your foolish little
escapades to the world. And they will
only net you sorrow.
In short. It doesn't pay, physically or
spiritually.

CLEVELAND, Aug. 26.â Upon the state
ment made to the police by Rev. Benedict
Roslnski, a Catholic priest of St. Stanis
las Church, that he had been held pris
oner for twenty-four -hours withouf food
and forced to sign two notes for $500 each
and two checks for like amounts, which
had since been cashed, besides being
robbed of $30 and some jewelry, two men
and a woman were arrested to-day.
Rev. Mr.. Rosinski says tjiat he received
two telephone messages on Thursday)
urging him to call upon Jennie Oeinski at j
359 Cedar avenue. He had been there but I
a few minutes when Juan Tuszynski j
rushed in and declaring himself to be the
woman's fiance demanded that the priest
give up $400 for the alleged alienating of
her affections. With Tuszyuski was. Leo
Czlchowskl, both of whom, according to
Rev. Mr. Rosinski's story, started at once
to beat him and tear his plot lies from his ;
back whn he refused to give them
money. .His jewelry was taken from him,
as well as $30, and he was held as a pris
oner until he consented to sign the checks j
and notes. The checks, it Is said, were
cashed by Tuszynski and the woman, j
Upon their return to the room with thai
money the priest says he was released, i
Rev. Mr. Roeinski notified the police and.'
the trio were arrested. The two notes
and $Sl9 were found under a, carpet in

der, together with tools 'that had been
brought for prospecting work. He had
just mounted his horse to carry some
tools up to the . mine | and Mrs. , McÃae
was preparing to lay out the lunch when
the terrible explosion occurred.
McÃae ' was ' rendered unconscious, and
when he regained his senses he was lying
about forty.feet from his horse. The first
thing he noticed : was that O3car.Ducloae,
one of the' party, 'was - screaming, with
pain and biting at hiÃ arms. He saw his
son lying dead and then missed hla wife.
Frantic with apprehension, he commenced
a search, but could find no trace of her.
Later the lower portions . ot : her limbs,
from the knees down, .were found | fifty
yards distant. | The - upper portion- of her
head was ,\u25a0 found In a deep ;. gulch sixty

DIPLOMACY is suspected to be the motive of M. de Witte's
desire for thorough publicity in the proceedings of the peace
conference, and that this- was indeed the first master move
in the game made by the big Russian as soon as he reached our
shores. Diplomacy in the sense in which the word- "suspected"
could apply to it would mean that shrewd form of it 'which seeks a
one-sided advantage rather than the maintaining of a just policy
that wouldibring about the right settlement of difficulties. One of
the grounds for thinking that the Russian plenipotentiary's ex
pressed wish to give out all the news was diplomatic in that mean
ing is that it seems inconsistent that the representative of a Gov
ernment which does not grant publicity of the press should -suddenly'
upon his arrival here become an extreme advocate of it.
We should not. however, be too easily disposed to believe that
his motive is sinister. Rather his move may have been a dexterous
one to obtain American and world sympathy for his side of the case
by making the contentions and arguments for it open and above
board. To do that boldly and frankly certainly rings like a chal
lenge of. one who is at least confident that his cause is just and can
stand the scrutiny of civilization. Dismissing the question of De
Witte's motive as a thing inscrutable, we may consider that prelim
inary announcement of his favoring an open discussion as being a
step toward high principles in diplomacy. Concealment 'and reserve
may. sometimes be necessary, but as a general : proposition /secrecy
is more apt to be sinister than is. the frankly proclaimed truth. The
issue of peace or war. between two great nations is to a large extent
the affair of the whole civilized world. It is not-^intermeddling to
want to know the whys and wherefores of it. Not only have? other
nations a moral right and interest in it to the extent of having 'the
facts plainly and promptly stated I so. they can express an opinion >

THERE is one county in this ; State that will be shunned : by
criminals until; a new Superior Judge is elected. ; When Judge
Wells of Contra ; Costa; County, sentenced the Selby. gold rob
ber, we had occasion to commend him.; He rejected all compound
ing arrangements and condoning of the offense because the loot
had been surrendered, and v punished the crime by a stiff sentence.
Since then^ the county was ; free from : great -Tcrimes against property
until an incautious and forgetful highwayman ' held up the messen
gers of the Central Bank of { Oakland on their way to Point Rich
mond and robbed them of $10,000.1 0,000. Th e V robb er was arrested , trie d
in Judge Wells' court and convicted. No doubthe had figured on a
short sentence for which his loot would be ample compensation.
But he figured vainly. The Judge gave him forty-five years. If he
should survive his term his $10^000 will amount to only $220 a year,
and that is no prize. * â¢," /*',.-â¢; ,' >'." : :: . Â»:*""-'

THE attention of the country has long been upon the graft in
politics. A little of it may well be given to graft in business.
Its most prominent manifestation is in the adulteration of food
stuffs. We said something recently about the loss of the market
for American cheese by supplying it with an article made of skim
milk and hog fat. That was commercial graft,* and it was promptly
punished and all American cheese, good and bad, suffered. What
we lost Canada gained.
The importation of butter into the British isles is very large.
We have retained a considerable share of it, notwithstanding our
bad reputation in" cheese. Great Britain has a General Health Board
whidh publishes every year its findings upon samples of food sub-,
mitted to it. In its last report it covers butter from all countries
that export that article to England. Of 69 samples from the United
States 54 contained dangerous preservatives and 43 were artificially
colored by dyes inimical to health. Of 79 samples from Norway
none contained adulterants. The American butter exporters who
work a get rich quick graft by using poison will be slightly . pun
ishe<Â£ tut the great punishment falls upon the American dairy inter
est. It is small comfort that, associated with American butter ex
porters in criminal adulteration are those 'of Australia, France and
Belgium. Norway with no adulterations and Denmark with only
one out of 271 samples are getting the trade.
r - Evidently it is time to divert some preaching from political to
commercial graft. It is a more serious menace^ to the nation, since
its consequences reach more innocent people* and are harder to
avoid. One election may end political graft. But how can the
honest and innocent producer end commercial graft?

AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY.
A NEWS dispatch from Omaha tells the romantic story .of a
candy girl. She was an expert worker in a factory .where
sweets are made. One day, in the gentle spring time, while
she packed a bucket of chocolates for the trade, languishing thoughts
came into her mind, as the coo of the doves entered the open win
dow, and she wrote her name and address on a card inviting the
finder to correspond, and committed it to the .sweet embrace of the
candy. " : * -'
The card was foundry a sweet-toothed soldier in far Luzon.
He wrote and she wrote. Photographs were exchanged, and of
course vows followed. The soldier's enlistment expired, but ) he
stayed, went into trade, amassed a fortune and' bought a ticket ;for
Omaha. He stopped long enough en route in California to buy a
randi and then sped eastward to find the lady air that his fancy had
painted. Now they marry and the story ends with the more than
matter of fact statement that they will live in a long, honeymoon on
his California ranch. It is a story of real and romantic life ' that
finds soft spots in the hearts even of the aged and hardened. But
it serves also to call attention to a frequently appearing item in th&
rural papers of the Middle West. In an appreciable percentage of
marriage notices is the statement: "The bride was doubly con
gratulated because the groom has already arranged to buy a Califor
nia ranch, which they will make their home." â¢ . .
What better advertisement could California have? The eyes
of the newly wedded turn to this State, for those unending days
of bliss and nights elysian guaranteed by our climate and scenery.
To bring a bride here to live is coming to be regarded sentimentally
as the best evidence of affection, and practically as the most valua
ble wedding portion that the groom can give. It has made- of the
marriageable girls of the East the best canvassers for the Golden
State. When the rural swain, sighing like a furnace, and shying
like a colt, at last nerves himself for the momentous proposal, he
gets a subjunctive assent. She will be his and will show her trust
' and devotion by going with him to live in California, as Mary,
Sallie and Susie did. What lover can resist! Right there California
gets two immigrants, two new settlers, in whose minds this State
"will be always associated with the most blissful moment of their
lives.
So it is that little Dan Cupid is the advance agent of California,
and the thousands of miles of cold iron rails that connect us with
the East are being gilded with romance. An overland railroad these
day is a "via amor," and new bowers are springing up all over the
State, in which industry and turtle doving.go hand in hand. There
has been nothing like it in real life before. The young bachelor
who is not prepared to come here has no standing in court. The
imagination of the ladies is fixed by the image of California and this
State is flourishing on the tender passion. As an inducement to
immigration it beats the gold discovery, and the rush hither of these
passionate pilgrims promises to be greater than that of the gold
hunters of '49.
. We should be prepared to properly receive this novel and most
acceptable immigration. When a couple of honeymoonsters ap
pear in a rural community, let them be made welcome. See to it
that their cottage is soon scented with flowers, and that the bride
is taught the mystery of making bread from California flour, and
. that the groom is well advised as to our seed time and harvest and
our methods of farming. Find out whence they came and when
vines cover their house and roses bloom on the lintel photograph
the dove cot and the dovelets, , and send the picture back' to 'the
local newspaper. Take it in the winter, when California rivals the
charms of the Vale of Cashmere, and when the East competes with
the terrors of the Arctic Circle, and great will be our gains in de
sirable population, for in the East the statement that a young couple
will live in California is the equivalent of the assurance in the ro
mantic novels that "They married and lived happily ever after."
What more useful reputation can a State have? It is far better
than to be known as a sanitarium for the sick, or for gold or silver,
or precious stones. Let happy lovers come in troops, for here
Venus is the morning star all the year 'round.
HE didn't win the prizes, and he said he couldn't: see . j
What in the whole* creation the dratted cause could ;be:
. "For," said he, "I. keep on working all the time I have to wo*
Andl honestly can mention only little things I shirk.
I-never cease my laboring until the given time,
Although to work a^ minute then, I'd count a shocking crime.
It is : really something awful, is' the fortune that I buck, . ', ,
And' l guess I'll have to lay it to my diabolic luck."
X "NOTHER won â¢â¢ no prizes, but he Vaid: "The fault is mine,
JT^L For/every -mortal has his chance, or so I still *opine;
If I've sort of missed the pay streak, why, the thing to do, I know,
Is to hustle for another that will make a better show.
And, in my* luck or outof luck,,to do the best I can;
No less to strike the stalwart' blow that indicates the man."
And so he won the game he played and gained both fame and pelf;
Although, he had no- luck at all, he made it for himself. .

Best Feature.
The purpose of Henry G. Hanchett's
new book. "The Art of the Musician,"
is to "emphasize the distinction between
the real study of music and the study
of the arts of playing and singing which
has so long been mistaken for it" It
is so written that it may also be used as
a textbook for instruction, but its prin
cipal design is' to aid those who desire
to understand the aims of a composer,
the methods of his work and to be
able to appreciate the fine things that
have been done by them. Although -it
is a work for those who already under
stand a. good deal about music, it has
much of interest j and | enlightenment for
those who, knowing nothing of music ex
cept Its! power to charm, 1 : wish to learn
something of the nature of the : mys
terious Dower and of the art of those
who can by its use so sway the emo
tions. yiQi&'Zk-*': â¢
It is a book that may be read with
profit by those who care '; for art as a
whole and realize that music is a very
important part of art. Considered in that
way, the bulk of . the i pages could be
understood and appreciated by. one who
knows nothing of the technique of music
The presentation of â¢ Its . main thought,
namely, that a knowledge of music just
for the purpose of understanding and ap
preciation as apart: from -the ; practical
ability to "or compose it,' Is
something that can and should be learn
ed. Is strongly done. The ' author says
that \u25a0 the place for ' such I education is in
school and college, although he also sug
gests municipal concerts, assisted by
popular lectures . and annotated pro
grammes. Such education, \u25a0' he says, does
not . absolutely require y- any ; technical
training In singing :or playing. . "Music
can be systematically, j interestingly, thor
oughly and usefully taught' without
teaching the art of performance."
In explaining the title.* "The Art^ of
the Musician." the'difnculty of satisfac
torily ; defining . art in any brief rway .is
at least attempted' of solution* fnithis:
"A fine art is the conscious vor iriten*
tlonal utterance of a thought by <word
or action : f or^ the | purpose |of - - creating
beauty or expressing ; emotion." :\u25a0 Under
such , ; n " definition 7 music \ easily \ takes
high rank, for .this authority; maintains

Andy Adams, the author of "The Log
of a Cowboy," has in his new book called
"The Outlet" given a pen picture of the
great cattle trail from Texas to the
Northwest and the strenuous life of the
men who toiled upon it at the time when
the business of transferring vast herds
in that way was at its height. In ISB4
this maximum was reached. Nearly 3tW
herds went north, and in them there were
nearly 800,000 head of cattle. It took
about 4000 men to handle these cattle,
and as to hold the herds in order each
man required a mount of seven or eight.
It required 30.000 horses to convoy the
vast droves to their destination. The cat
tle had been multiplying for many years
on the pastures of Texas, and. an outlet
to market for them was imperatively
needed. This great pastoral movement,
supposed to be the greatest the world
ever saw. was "The Outlet." The value
of the drive in ISS4 ran into the millions.
That was a well chosen time to picture
the cowboy, and the life on the trails.
Andy Adams shows a complete familiari
ty with the subject he has chosen. He
goes into minute details of the work, and
thus weaves his story with something
like a historic description of that pictur
esque phase of our industrial life which
has practically passed away. Mingled
with the telling is much good philosophy.
A mere detail of a boss' instructions, or
settlement of a dispute, contains a lesson
of life that mJght be applicable to any
large decisions where character and com
mon sense count. The book bristles with
the forceful and peculiar phrases of the
cowboy. Adams can talk In cowboy as If
he were to, the manner born and needed
not imaginative imitation as do some
writers about character. on the Western
plains who expect you to assume that
they have "been there" more than very
superficially. This author has been there
so thoroughly that with his words he
can carry your mind where. his has been.
He gives you passing glimpses of cowboy
hardships and the matter of course way
they are borne. There Is little luxury
even In camp,*- and when you happen to
get shut off from it then there's hunger
and thirst by day and chilly sleeping by
night. "Land terrapin make larruping
good eating when you are cut off from
camp this- way. Blankets? Never use
them: sleep on your belly and cover with
your back, and get up with the birds in
the morning."
The story starts out- with the ac
count of what the author calls "open
ing the campaign." The drover is pick
ing his trail bosses and the men who
are to serve under' them. : : He prefers
men who are not prone to admire their
shadow in sunny, nor get homesick, in
falling weather. When the trail bosses
are selecting the mounts for the dif
ferent herds they have a dispute- about
the method of dtvision. each one, of
course, wanting to get the best saddle
horses One proposes to make running
cuts of ten head* each, and then - toss
up for choice of the bunches. The op
posing foreman prefers ' to choose \u25a0;â¢ the
horses one : by one, and turn about.
They . appeal to the drover, and ;/â¢ he
rides up and promptly ' decides the dif
ference thus: "Well, the way I size this
up," said \u25a0 old man; Don,; "one of > you
wants to rely "on Tils own Judgment
and the other don't. It looks to? me,
Quince, you want a gambler's chance
where you. can't lose. Tom's willing
to bank on his own judgment, but you
ain't. Now I like a' man who does his
own thinking, , and to give â¢ you a good
lesson . in that line, why, divvy . them,
horse and horse., turn T aboiit." -.
So the â¢- foreman who was willing ;{to
back his own Judgment first gets the best
mounts. He knew " the , horses Indlvid
uallr because on a return trip down <
he explains that the music ! Is in the
thought Conveyed through j the. sounds,
not in the sounds themselves. The only
art which he thinks can equal or; ex
ceed music Is poetry,< and . there arÂ«i
some trays , ln which even poetry. must
fall short of the extent of expression
that the former has.' for there are
depths feeling in music to which
words can never attain. -A pair of defi
nitions are these: "Poetry-^Great
thoughts expressed In beautiful' lan
guage"; "Musicâ Great - feeling . ex
pressed in beautiful sound."
/; A notable plea made, tw ithe book is
for the exaltation of a general culture
in music over the personal; display, of
some rare adept in the art. He wishes
to stimulate : co-operative study" of the
great oratorios, to have a form of mu
sical art that would insure the united
effort of- the largest numbers; for this,
he says, "has the largest Influence upon
character and culture and is most to
be approved." Hanchett's eloquont : ap
peal to all the world to thus try to*
teach and to learn more power to.un
derstand" and appreciate this great con
soling,, uplifting and delighting lan
guage of the emotions closes with this
superlative incentive: ! .V . V
"We have been absorbed In sounds,
rhythms* execution; better things 'will
result from turning attention more in
sistently upon imaginings, beauty, life.

â¢golden harps' make us dream of; it as
the art of.heaVen. A proper use, of our

this time than he was the other." .

gineer meets and admires his business

Notes of Literary
importance.
A lot of skepticism has been expressed,
both in. print and otherwise, as to wheth
er Helen Woljeska, whose name appears
as the - author of that remarkable little
book,. "A Woman's Confessional," T was a
real person. â¢ One critic even went so far
as to reproach the supposedly anonymous
author for trading on a pseudonym pur
posely made to resemble that of the loved
and respected actress, Helen Modjeska.
Life Publishing Company, whose Imprint
"A Woman's Confessional" bears, .vouches
forl the . fact that Helen Woljeska is
not only the name of a living person, but
that it belongs of right to the author,
who is a very charming woman, living
in one of New York's immediate suburbs.
Further than this the publishers do not
go, leaving it to the author and her read
ers to settle just how much additional
light shall be thrown on the authorship
of this remarkable revelation of a wom
an's innermost thoughts.
Quite recently I chanced to see the re
ply of Mr. Hamilton W. Mable to an In
quirer who asked him how to study
Browningâ what commentaries to get,
etc. Mr. Mable said: "Get no commenta
ries; get a good edition of Browning. Do
not approach him as a philosopher, scien
tist, or a problem; approach him as a
human. poet' of the nineteenth century. It
has been Browning's unfortunate fate to
be enveloped in fogs of discussion. â¢ â¢ â¢
to be overloaded .with notes, illustrations,
and explanations of every sort and kind.
The result - has . been that' many people
who would have found Browning of Ines
timable'value in 'their mental and spirit
ual life have been repelled from him." â

Mr. . Henry Wellington Wack. the au
thor of "The Romance of Victor Hugo
and Juliette ; Drouet," published by the
Putnams.says that a number of readers
have written to ask him why he did not
extend his interesting -story to include
the; liaison between Mme. -oigo and the
critic Sainte-Beuve.one correspondent as
suming his ignorance of that affair. The
only treason for mentioning this matter
in : Mr. - Wack's book would have been to
avoid , placing Mme. Hugo in the unde
served position of an , innocent heroine.
Mr.' Wack, who . is â¢ thoroughly familiar
with all . the aspect* of the Lie of the
Hugos, prefers that ...Ja error should pre
vail rather than that the exquisite story
of Victor; Hugo and Juliette Drouet
should be marred by any connection with
an unlovely, scandal. "
I The .most talked of magazine of *the
month is the American Illustrated Maga
zine; known \ for thirty years as Leslie's
Monthly. ; The editors under
stood that the first issue' under the new

criticism;" for" the. striking thing- about the
number is its very 'uniform excellence.
The magazine. In printing and illustra
tion, is^ finished^ with the greatest care.
It begins with the first chapter of a beau
tifully Illustrated history of American

ness is significantly .treated by a study of

the i number, there \ is the \ same attention
given V to the :: personalities \u25a0of interesting

the trail he had volunteered' the dis
agreeable duty of rustling the; horses
home, while others of the outfit trav
eled on the train. "I swallowed their
dust to the Arkansaw, and from there
home we lived In clouds of alkali."
When a man gets provokingly mean
and tries to have things his own selfish
way the foreman "put him up against
the alternative of backing down or
Eudden duel to the death with play
fully polite words of warning: "Just
keep on acting the â fool if you
want a little smoke thrown . in. your
face. I'll fog you till you look like an
angel in the clouds." So they work. on
strenuously and play -with -expressions.
When the foreman turns in his expense
account at Abilene the boss remarks as
he looks it over: "This item marked
'sundries' was dry goods, I suppose."
A bit of description that will serve
for'sample ;is the following. The ar
tist, E. Boyd Smith, has pictured it:
"Like a climax to a week of sore
trials, when we were in sight of Red
River a sand and dust storm struck
us, blinding both men and herd for
hours. The beeves fared best, for, with
lowered heads, they turned their backs
to the howling gale, while the horse
men caught.it on every side. The cat
tle drifted a*, will in an uncontrollable
mass; -The air was so filled with drift
ing sand and eddying dust that* lt was
impossible to see a mounted man at a
distance of fifty yards. The wind blew
a hurricane, making It impossible to
dismount in the face of it. Our horses
trembled with fear, unsteady on their
feet. The very sky overhead darkened
as if night was falling. Two-thirds
of the men threw themselves in the
lead of .the beeves, firing six-shooters
to check them, which could not even
be heard by the ones on the flank and
in the rear. Once ; the herd drifted
against a wire fencer leveled it down
and moved on, sullen and irresistible."
(Houghton, MifHin & Co., New York.)
vividly written about as they became
a part of the Missourian's story. There
is the Emperor Maximilian, "Archduke
of Austria, occupant of the New
World's throne, created for him";
Charlotte of Orleans, the Empress;
Marshal Bazaine, commander in chief
oi the French . army of occupation in
Mexico; Daniel Boone, the scout; and
Benito Juarez, President of the Mexi
can republic. Around these are a
number of picturesque heroes and ras
cals. . - .'.'
The account given of Maximilian is
quite a feature of the book. The de
scription of his strange mixture of
'nobleness and faults, of princely bear-
Ing and of incapacity; weak, imprac
! tical life and most heroic and dignified
l death, makes a vivid picture that will
â¢ last long in the memory. He imagines
' himself as being really loved by the
j Mexicans as the ideal "Fair God" of
! their superstition, and dreamily
! plans to live up to the ideal and be to
| them a great Emperor, who will en
! noble the race and make theirs a great
| empire. "The high, broad forehead of
\u25a0a gentle poet was often shaded by a
j dreamy melancholy, but never once did
[it furrow in either craft or guile." He
! is shown to have been" dandified in his
care of his Immense, pretty beard. The
story imputes to him the fault or being
unscrupulously sensual and says that
! the shape of his lower lip truly indi
| cated that trait. He did not impress
! the Missourian favorably, and no one
; following his adventures will regret
i that the Southern soldiers did not en
! list in his service.
* The motive and the mission of the
charming Jacqueline was a . peculiar
one. Although in the employ of Napo-
I leon 111 and suspected of being a will
ing favorite of Maximilian, she seema
to have been actuated solely by a pas
sionate, patriotic love for France. She
i Intrigued to make Mexico a province
of France and thought Napoleon was a
fool for not directly ordering it so.
That motive of hers was so dominnat
that it overmastered even her love for
the young soldier, Driscoll, and in the
chapter called "The Strangest Avowal
of Love" she delivers him over to what
she believes will be a fatal court-mar
tial. Here Is an extract from the end
of her love letter, at the beginning of
which she confesses that she had be
trayed him to his enemies and to death:
rÃelleve â only believe, monsieur â
that it is a cruel duty, not permitting
that I shall listen to my heart. If you ;
but knew. If you but knew â and you j
shall know. Monsieur Driscollâ l, O i
mon chevalier, it Is that I love you.
There, know then, dear heart, the enor- j
mity of my sacrifice. Know that I envy |
you, for you are going, and I must stay, j
all alone, without you. Mon bien aime, i
without you, through all my life.".

"To my two best friend*, my father and
my mother." is the dedication of the
young author, Eugene P. Lyle Jr., to his
brand new and stirringly good story. "The
Missourian."' Those parents and two best
frifcniis of h:s should appreciate the dedi
cation and be proud of the book and its
author, for it is a thing of worth. August
Is a dull literary season and few good
books are born in it, but this tale of the
daring Missouri soldier boy breaks the
monotony of slow coming and mediocre
output like a thunder storm breaks a
drought. It is terrible in the danger it
surrounds us with, but It is oellciously
refreshing. The young soldier was dub
bed "The Storm Center" by his comrades
in arms during the Civil v.ar. because in
battle wherever the thickest of the fight
centered there was he. The author
makes good "In picturing to Us a youth
who could win such a title. He is con
vincing. The Missourian had a soldier
soul in hi? bosom of the natural born
kind, and his descrlbÂ«r makes his imag
ination martial and writes of him vitally,
vervefully â as If he loved him, and was
linked to him in kindred of daredeviltry.
\u25a0 The scene of the story ie in Mexico at
the time Maximilian was playing Emperor
there. The hero is John D. Driscoll, fa
miliarly shortened to Din Driscoll. who
at the close of the war finds himself a
lieutenant colonel in General Joe Shelby's
brigade of Confederates. He was little
more than a boy, but long and hard
Cphting had toughened him into strong
manhood and veteran courage. The time
cf the novel's beginning is so close to the
end of the Civil War ths*. the officers of
the Trajis-Mississippl department foresaw
Lee's surrender and acting on the sug
gestion of General Shelby proposed to re
fuse to lay down their arms, but to go
Instead with a remnant of their armies,
fifty thousand strong, into Mexico and
offer their services to Maximilian. Young
Driscoll Is sent on the mission of mak
ing this arrangement at the court of
Mexico. In that disordered country he
meets with many adventures and goes
through them with a headlong dash of
courage and wits that makes the Ameri
can trooper very attractive to us, and
we wonder not a bit that the Marquise
Jeanne d'Aumerle, beautiful, well-born,
and talented, "on a mission of high poli
tics from Napoleon 111 to the court of
Mexico." falls In love with him.
This lady is called Jacqueline
through the story- It was a pet name
given her when she was a child be
cause she was naturally such a little
rebel the title suited her and stuck.
She loves adventure almost as much as
the Missourian, and is with him in
many of his dangers. It is some little
time before the patrician and pedigreed
French woman fully recognized of what
quality was the plainly dressed soldier.
"Instinctive, Inbred, unconscious and |
unregistered in any etudbook of Burke j
or Gotha â but quality."'. It was a long j
-time, too, before the American trooper
took in the fact that the French girl
was naturally thoroughbred as well as
being nominally so. Through many
chapters he thinks she is a frivolous
court beauty, clever, intriguing, and
the mistress of Maximilian. The story
represents that as being the estimate of
her at the Mexican court, but it was
only a bandit chief that dared say it in
words.
The haunting of that suspicion after
it had bÂ«en almost dismissed from the
mind of the Missourian makes material
for the dramatic ending of a love scene
between the two mutually attracted
young ardents in the chapter called "If
a Kiss Were AiL" The final sentences
bring a sudden surprise because of a
playful thing the lady said, ill-calcu
lating its effect on amorous masculin
ity. That effect was to greatly extend
a love story that in the midst of the
""""chapter promised a sudden consumma
tion. When the reader reaches that in
teresting point he will be grateful for
this tip that the thing wasn't com
pletely spelled, although it seemed so.
He can read on hopefully.
The story starts with the willful
landing of Jacqueline at Tampico from
the French ship Imperatrice Eugenic.
Just for a lark. While on shore she
meets a Mexican bandit chief and sud
dently decides to accept his offered es
cort for an overland trip to the Mexi
can capital. The French officer guard-
Ing her. Michel Ney, "grandson of the
bravest of the brave," strongly objects
and tries to take bis fair charge back
to the ship, but she outwits and out
commands him. and goes on her ad
ventures across country with her maid
and such ctivalric protection of ac
companying men as fate chose to send.
It came out ail right, but she took des
perate chances. She is represented as
pining for experiences. It pained her
to be no more than a spectator of life,
che wished even its dangers to touch
her.
The entrance of Driscoll into his ad
ventnres starts the story with a scud.
He boards a Mexican blockade runner
at Mobile, the swift schooner La Luz,
and by power of passports signed by
Jeff Davis virtually takes command.
They dash out. daringly hugging; the
curfy shore to avoid detection; but the
Yankee ships guarding the port give
chase and there is an exciting race.
By throwing the cargo overboard the
La Luz is lightened to escaping speed.
So you arc brought into the rush of
dzrisrt-rs, and the author . never lets you
out till the closing chapter. The
/ schooner reaches Tampico Just in time
fnr DriÃcoll to join Jacqueline on her
overland trip through the brigand and
guerrilla infested empire of Maximilian.
An extract from the description of one
of the tights which took place on that
trip will give a good idea of the ad
mirable adaptation of the author's
style to the telling of a stirring story.
It relates a charge led by Colonel Da
pin, "the tiger of the tropic*." chief
of the Centra Guerrillas, against some
Mexican marauders:
"Then there beat into Driscoll's ears
' the furious clatter of hoofs. It deaf- j
ened him, the familiar, glorious din !
of It. The blood raged In his veins {
like fiery needle points. To see thorn j
â the cavalry, the cavalry! Then they
were pone â a flashing: streak of Cen
taurs, a streamer of red in a blur of
duet, maniac oaths and pistol shots
and sweeping sabers. Hacked bodies
were swept beneath the swarm as sap
ling's under an avalanche. , , Driscoll i
sprang up and gazed. Through eddying {
swirls he could still see red-Bleeved
arms reach out and lightning rays of.
steel, and half-naked fleeting creatures
po down, and never a Jot of the curse's
speed abate.
, " 'Lordy. but Old Joe should 'a' seen

ing of 'Shelby, of the old brigade back

upon rereading his proofs, decided to add
a postscript to his preface, which was
already of some length. The preface and

twenty pages, and It has been pronounced

The Matinee GlrL in the Dramatic Mir
ror of this week, devotes & long column
and a half to "In the Bishop's Carriage."
the dramatization of Miss Miriam Michel
son's brilliant story that has Just been
made by Charming Pollock. From tilÂ©
Matinee Girl's account the play seems to"
have achieved immediate success. Nu
merous changes have been made In thÂ©
story, though it* chief lines are left un
touched. Most important of the changes
is the one which makes Latlmer the
lover of Nancy, and relegates Fred Ober
muller to the role of "platonic friend and
I manager, with one eye to Nance's charms
but the other on the box office." Mr.
Pollock again, as thÂ© Matinee Girl puts
It. has, "for reasons to him sufficient.
omitted the confounding: of the theatrical
trust by a sharp-witted girl, but has kept
Nance Olden so busy with her love affairs
and her reformation that, besides her
profession, that of a thief, there
was quite enough to do In one evening,
and the disappointment at the omission
of her big task in the- book was short
lived.
Latlmer has been transformed â¢ faom in
valid to a sort of Sylvaln in the' "Leah
Kleschna"' role. As Sylvain with Leah.
La tinier assumes the task of reforming:
Nance.
"What can a man* do for a girl like
you?" he asks, thoughtfully, after mak
ing Nance restore - the articles Tom
Dorgran has stolen, and which she re
ceived, playing the role of "fence."
"Do." snaps Nance. "He can reform
her. show her how to get diamonds of
her own."
"Or to do without them." he repliesâ
all still according to the Matinee Girl.
Very good word, of her own spark
ling and whimsical sort, the lady gives
to Julia Dean, to whom the role of Nance
is intrusted.. Great favorite Is Miss Dean
here, and the following . will therefore
be welcome hearing: "Temperament
ally Miss Dean Is admirably adapted to
the role of the high-spirited, generous,
cunning, loyal little guttersnipe. Her
gift of comedy Is known, but to those
who have followed her work her emo
tional power, shown in the climax of the
fourth act. was a revelation. , The
shifty cunning, the bravado and thÂ©
coarse lapses of the waif of circum
stance were well portrayed. Henrietta
Crosman, in her profane exit from the
window In Mistress Nell was not more
effective than was Miss Dean in her
first curtain order to the chauffeur of
Latirner's automobile: "Go where you

The whole cast seem 3 to have been
remarkably fit. and the play to =bÂ©

In the presence of Presiding Judgg
Lawlor, District Attorney Byington &M
Assistant District Attorney '. Ferral, Chief
Deputy County Clerk Morris -drew from
the Jury box yesterday 'afternoon : thirty
names, forming the list â¢ from .which \u25a0 the
new Grand Jury is to be drawn. Prior to
that the 144 names, ' being twelve ; fur
nished by each Judge, were drawn from
the box and checked. . .
The system includes the method (of *F.
H. r * De , Pue,' formerly a turnkey at.Fol
som, which-. has been used in connection
with the â¢ Bertlllon f for years. With" the
imprint^of : the -fingers on paper ' and : fie
De Pue'crosa-section photograph a crim
inal once listed can always be ' identified.
There is no change in finger-prints. ,
Each of the \u25a0 prisoners was brought . into
the ; identification-room at San Quentin
and- the .fingers were inked, one at a time,'
and the 'imprints' made arranged accord
ing .to number. -/After .- the , fingers \u25a0 had
been imprinted !the four fingers' of each
hand were imprinted together, so if a dif
ficulty is later experienced in deciphering
those taken", separately . a microscopic ex
amination of : the \u25a0\u25a0 four â¢ will j determine to
which hand any other' belongs. ;
The prisoner's "name and number Is
placed on the identification slip, and . with
it his photograph is filed. In this way, it
is asserted by. De Pue, there can be no
possible chance for a criminal being, mis
taken once he is ( subjected to the system.
""After the use. of the De Pue finger^ print
method has been established the Bertillon
system, 1 first installed on the coast at San
Quentin, .will .be abolished. Apparatus
has been 'procured, so it will not be long
until this takes place. ' /
"The - finger ' print method of identifica-'
tion j was first employed by. the Chinese
700 years before Christ, and is the method
used in Scotland Yard work. It has been
a success in all. criminal work because of
its infallibility, as, the experts assert,
once the corrugations of skin are formed
on ; a* finger- there will, be no change
through .'life. *>-./â¢ ;\u25a0.-/, '.,;'."
A recent caseof the success of the sys
tem'was recorded" in the return of two
French: criminals to Paris after they had
fled 1 to .London by comparing the finger
prints found on 'a wine bottle used by the
men in committing a murder in a Paris
cafe. The incident excited the Interest of
criminologlsts ; all over. the world and may
have ' been material in causing the estab
lishment of. the. method in ! ; California
prisons. " > .v : .\u25a0 , \u25a0\u25a0''*. \u25a0- '\u25a0 ;-â¢
As : soon as 'the records are completed
at San Que.ntin De Pue and his assistants

the same process.

NEW YORK. Aug. 2Â«. â The name of
jj the youth serving a term In prison as
\u25a0A burglar In order to save a wealthy
woman's honor will not be made
known by those moving to. secure; bis
freedom until the criminal courts meet
next month. Then the whole matter.
Including the . identity of the woman
for whom the youth 'is suffering, the
deepest disgrace, will necessarily be
come public. Publicity will follow the"
motion by Carl Flscher-Hansen, the
attorney in the case, for a new trlaL
The woman will, it is declared, will
ingly expose herself -to any-humilia
tion in order to right the great wrong.
From a reliable eource it" is ascer
tained that thiÃ young man. was an, ut
ter straiiger to , the husband of the
woman who seeks to llberate-hlm. ' The
husband did not know him when he,
saw him in the house and. had no idea
that the young man was a visitor there.
The home of the young man is in the
West and he. was a student in one of
the Eastern universities.""' Helmet "thel
woman through an acquaintance when
on Â» visit to ; this city with college
chums." - " -"',,â¢. .;.,â¢".
Han sen admitted to-day that he bad
investigated the story 1 sufficiently to be
certain that what the woman had told
him was true. He was in doubt about
the details and said he would not dÂ»
cuss them until the matter comes up
In court," when all would be disclosed.
In the meantime he will ascertain if
the supposed burglar is in Sing Sing
or ElmirsL . 'tffis
It is said that the prisoner is a son
of the . head of a large manufacturing j
concern' which has branch houses in]
different parts of the country and that
none of his family know where he is
or anything of the circumstances that
led him to voluntarily enter prison.
That the woman who is now willing
to sacrifice her standing in society to
k release the young man who saved her
name is a. member of an old New
York family was learned definitely.
That she is a member of one of the
xnoEt exclusive church congregations,
as told by Carl Fischer- Hansen, who
was retained by the woman to aid her
in securing the release of the young
man, was also established. Her family
name was given to one of the \u25a0 city's
streets.
Not only has the woman decided- to
make her own sacrifice in return for
what the man did for' her, but steps
are being taken to bring to justice a
band of blackmailers, headed by a law
yer and a woman, who have succeeded
in extorting money from her. It was
discovered to-day that they got 1100,000
In all from their victim, including a
fine house. Papers In a civil suit
against them were prepared | to-day by
H&nsen to recover the money and If
this suit is successful the blackmailers
will be. takes before the .Grand Jury
and Indicted for conspiracy and black
mail The real estate Is believed to be
the home in this city of the woman
who feared to let the simple truth be
known.

It is calculated that- a- third of the

Parisian Newspaper Suggest* a Use for
PARIS, Aug. 26.â Owing to the re
ports from Portsmouth indicating that
the question of peace between Russia
and Japan hinges solely on Russia pay
ing an Indemnity to Japan; the. Matin
cabled to-night a remarkable appeal to
John D. Rockefeller at Cleveland. The
appeal, in part, follows:
"The question of money, threatens to
unloosen afresh and with redoubled
violence the scourge of war. \u25a0 Presi
dent Roosevelt Is making noble and
heroic efforts to end a struggle be
tween two nations, whose populations
amount to one-seventh of the entire
population of the globe. His initia
tive honors America. In the opinion, of
the civilized nations. i â
"The question arises as to whether
another American 1 would not share the
glory of Mr. Roosevelt and complete his
work by overcoming the sole obstacle
now hindering peace. He would thus
demonstrate the might of .. money in
powerful and . generous hands.
- "The h Matin, - constituting itself
spokesman for this sentiment, ad
dresses the richest citizen. In [the world.".
The appeal concludes with lengthy
arguments showing the, immense ben-
' But no adequate account of the pro
ceedings at to-day's meeting Is forth
coming. The plenipotentiaries by
agreement excluded the secretaries.
There were no minutes. There Is no
record. This. In itself, is extremely
significant. When men who are fight
ing a desperate battle lock themselves
In a room alone, it is" the best evidence
that they ere terribly in earnest: It
is a hopeful sign. All that is formally
announced is that the minutes of the
last session were approved and, upon
Baron Komura's motion, the conference
adjourned until Monday at 3 o'clock;
but whether or not the counter-propo
aitlon of Russia was submitted at this
afternoon's session it seems to be "up
to Japan" to formally renounce her
demand for the frals de guerre, and
try to obtain a partial recompense In i
another way â for Instance, by a bona!
fide eale of the northern half of Baj?- i

Emperor Nicholas' reply to Embas- !
\u25a0ador Meyer and his instruction to Mr
de Witte are remarked as his last word]
bo far as Indemnity is concerned. A
compromise by which Japan can secure
a comparatively moderate sum of
money Is etlll open.
But the gulf to be spanned Is still
wide between the two adversaries.
Russia cow is willing to divide Sagha-
In the regular course of procedure,
after the presentation of the Japanese
compromise proposition on Wednesday,
the diplomatic move passed to Russia
and it was Mr. de Wltte's turn, natural
ly, to present the counter-proposition
ct his Government. If he succeeded,
as intimated. In withholding his card
and forcing the Japanese to play again
he undoubtedly gained a point in the
game.
According to the Russian version it
was Japan and not Russia which
weakened this afternoon. Mr. de Wltte
publicly announced after the sitting
that it was Baron Komura who asked
for an adjournment until Monday in
ord*-r to have time to submit a new
proposition. Yet it is known that Mr.
dÂ« Wine has received instructions,
sent after the President's intercession
at Peterhof through Embassador Mey
er, to agree to the division of Saghallen
a.nd to permit liberal compensation for
the Russian prisoners of war and the
cession of the Chinese Eastern, Rail
road, but to continue absolutely to re
fuse to pay war tribute under* any
guise. This was described as Russia's
"ultimatum," leaving over the same old
question of money â the etumbling
block to an agreement.

The main hope of peace rests, as be

at heart seriously endeavoring to end
the war. All the principles involved in
the war have been settled in favor of

subjects, which probably will , entail the,
exchange *of pourparlers or further
notes. However, it is certain that pro

suggests amendments. This fact gives
reason for the belief that a definite agree

The war In the East has had consider
able Influence upon commerce, ' and espe
cially In American oil there, is a great

has a dangerous competitor in Japan and
also in China itself, which yearly pro

Consul Sammons" of Newchwang has
cent to the State Department a report In
which he takes a very optimistic view
of the boycott on American goods. He
declares that the strongest movement in
favor of the boycott is to be found In
Shanghai, where most American goods
are landed, but that only certain elements
to the city favor it. and the leading mer
chants are opposed and will force the
anti-American agitation fo die out soon.

gether the 'fight consumed the better
\u25a0part of thirty, minutes.

who is a much larger man than Canty. j
Olson calledithe mate a number of vile
names and dared him to 'fight.' . In ex
plaining the affair. Mate Con ty: said:
"Can a Yankee take such talk from a
Dutchman?",. .' /â¢

ordered them off the brig. Mayer re
plied by'Snapplng his revolver several
times at .Canty/ who replied by firing
two shots from the : Winchester.,
Winters j received one', of the bullets
, in the leg, but. this did not finder him
from getting over the side of the ves
sel. . Later Winters was taken |to the
Agnew Sanatorium, while Canty was
arrested andheld under $1000 bonds for
his preliminary hearing yoxt Thursday.
The Galilee was to have sailed -to
morrow afternoon, .but as .the mate is
under* bonds "and a number of the crew
have been summoned as witnesses, she
will not. get away for. Honolulu for sev
eral \ days. Mayer was arrested this
evening, and, with Canty, is charged
with assault' with a deadly' wean,qn:Â£. \

Without any useless preliminaries the
men were at it.' : Back and forth over
the. decks orithe Galilee they \u25a0? fought."
Then; they fought down the gangplank
and -on the Government wharf. Here

The little, boy was "vaccinated on July

\u25a0 Brother- physicians hold Dr. Birdsall
blameless.. It is the universal belief that,
the bandage covering the wound must !
have slipped from the | child's \ arm and \
that some foreign substance entered the â¢
wound' and -infected it. ..~ . .y ' ' j
- Dr. Birdsair. is ; heartbroken over the |
affair, though those who understand the i
conditions exonerate him. "It- is one of j
those accidents that some- Â»
times occur." he said yesterday. "I used '\u25a0
the \u25a0 same ; vacclnÂ« lon six other children, j
but "none of ; them showed any 111; effects
from it. The child ' in playing must , have
disturbed Â£ the Ibandage. ; Some â¢ foreign
substance must have entered the wound.
â¢'I had nothing to do with the baby's
case, since last Sunday, so I can give no
opinion as, to the, cause. Ido not believe
that; this' is a' direct result of the vac
cination. ; Tetanus usually appears with
in "ten. days or two weeks after a wound
has. been Inflicted." â¢ \u25a0 "

GRAYS WILL BE IN LINE.
The large number of people who will go
to Sacramento from San Francisco to at
tend the celebration of Admission day
by the Native Spns of the Golden West
will be so large that trains will have to
bo started early on the ntght of Septem
ber 8, and for., this reason the _ general
committee has decided 'to abandon its
plans for an eve of celebration parade in
this city, an event which in the past has
always been a distinctive feature of the
festivities.
At the meeting last evening of the joint
9th of September celebration committee,
of which William D. Hynes is the.presi
dent. George W. Gerhardt the vice presi
dent, Roland =M. Roche the secretary and
W. J. Wolfe the treasurer, it was report
ed that Sacramento County will be rep
resented In the festivities by Sunset, Oak
Park, Elk Grove and Granite parlors.
The statement was made that from fig
ures at hand and data as to details the
parade in the capital city wlllsurpass all
previous parades as to length and ele
gance of display. The procession will
move at 11 o'clock on the morning of Sep
tember 9. There will be literary, exercises
at 1:30 : o'clock In : the afternoon, after
which there â¢ will be open house at Sut
ters Fort, and in the evening there is to
be an electric parade.
The Sacramento committee of arrange
ments announced that a march composed
by Alice May de ]Lew of La Bandera Par
lor of Sacramento had been | adopted as
the official march, which will be played
by all bands during the parade. V
The secretary was instructed to j notify
all Native Daughter parlors *of what will
be done at the celebration.
There will be twelve ticket sellers on
behalf of the parlors at the ferry landing
and four on the other side of the bay. V
Pacific Parlor, which has always
taken a prominent part in; the Admis
sion day celebration! ; will be out - in
strong numbers :at Sacramento. The
parlor will have about 150 members in
line in' white uniforms trimmed with
gold lace, and each will- wear, a cap
of the United , States; army pattern. In
Its position 1 In the parade line the par
lor will be Pleaded by the California
Grays, an organization ( of ; fifty, men
who were to have "paraded ; with ;.^the
Knights Templar in \u25a0 this â¢ city, but were
prevented from so' doing, by the non?
arrival of a special' uniform for that
occasion. .'\u25a0;..'; ~~''}~*
i^The parlor , has secured \u25a0 thel Foresters'
large hall on I street, between Eighth
and i Ninth. 'as headquarters/ and j this
place will ,be lavishly jjjf decorated j with
cv ergreena and . bunting by the decoration
committee, .under the direction of James
Neeley. Immediately after the parade on
the.ath the members' wili;;with. their lady
relatives and friends, partake of a ban
quet at, the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation rooms, after which there will: be
an adjournment to the headquarters,
where there will be dancing -during 'the
remainder of the afternoon, also :during
the evening. Refreshments will be served

rr^HAT'S what you'll save if you buy that piano
-I- right now at this Clearance sale.
â¢Figure it out for yourself. The average reduction
in price on a piano is Sioo. For example, you can get
a $300 piano for $200. The above picture shows how
much is practically paid on the piano the minute you
pay the Â£6 down. The reduction equals as much as
is shown in the shaded part of the picture.
We sell pianos for $6 down and $6 a month. Now
divide $6 (the amount of one payment) into $100
(the amount you save on the price of the instrument)
and the answer is- 16 and a fraction. So you sec we
actually save you 16 payments. This means the piano
is paid for a year and a third quicker than if you
bought the instrument at its regular price.
The big reduction in price,' the easy terms, our
liberal guarantee and the reliability of the piano will
certainly induce you to buy hereâ the only place"
where you can get such advantages. V

It was the intention to have Mrs. Tag
ear t follow "Billy" Taggart on the stand,
but as only an hour remained before time
to adjourn to-day her attorneys decided
to occupy the Interim with character wit
nesses and leave Mrs. Taggart to take the'
stand on Monday morning.
The cross-examination of "Billy" occu
pied most of the morning. He was ques
tioned closely as to the source of his in
come, but nothing satisfactory was de
veloped except that he had several times
received money from Mrs. Taggart.
When "Billy" left the stand Judge
KaÂ«on, on motion of Attorney Sterling,
ordered that he should remain within the
jurisdiction of the court, as he probably
vould be wanted as a witness later on.-
Henry Haller. in whose house Mrs. Tag
eart has been living for the past fourteen
months*, was then called to the stand to
testify as to Mrs. Taggarfs care for the
childrenn. He said that she was a- kind
and loving mother. Four other witnesses
gave testimony of a similar character." ;

mission of witnesses as to Mrs. Taggarfs
character and her life In Wooster said
the granting of a divorce was not of as

I left off their medicine and began the

my bands were so swollen and painful

It was helping me I continued it, and to-

The inactivity of the Liver, Kidneys and

in the 6ystem, which, coming in contact-
with the different acids of the "body,
forms uric arid to be absorbed by the
blood, and distributed to the different
joints and muscles, producing the pains,
inflammation and other distressing symp-
toms of Rheumatism. The wandering

that the poison is still in the blood and

The breaking of the ground for the
new Trinity " English Lutheran Church
at Eighteenth and Howard streets took
place yesterday In the presence of the
many enthusiastic members of the con
gregation. About the only ceremony
before the breaking of the ground was
a 6hort address by the pastor, Rev. B.
M. Stensrud, In which' he gave In brief
the history of h the church since it waÂ»
organized on. April 24. 1899. ?' ' Â«
For the first five months of Its ex
istence the congregation met : In the
Scandinavian Church on Howard street,
near Thirteenth, ' and then moved to
Mission Parlor, Hall, where it remained
for a year and a half, the. last move
being from there to the present quar
ters in Mission Opera Hall. Mission
street, near Eighteenth.
As soon as the church was organized
the ladies began to devise ways and
means to build a house of worship.
Two years ago they bought, the lot,
paying $1000 out of their own fund and
$6000 which they received from the
Lutheran Synod.
The church when finished and fur
nished will cost in the neighborhood of
$20,000, of which $15,000 is already In
sight, and it is hoped that the other
$5000 will be raised before the com
pletion of the contract. The contract
was let to one of the leading members
for $16,320, and is to be completed in
six months' time.

PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 26.â The auburn
tressed Miss Frances Hale was in a gay
and confident humor as sh* related her
story of the Los Angeles affair for which,
she has been Indicted by the Grand Jury
for embezzlement. "Jealous women and
a conceited man are at the bottom -of
these trumped up charges." said the
woman who made the sensational climb
up the side of the Roanoke in San Fran
cisco Bay.
"My contract was made with the .Door
of Hope directors about a month ago to
give an entertainment' I. was . to get all
the money . received for tickets I . sold
myself. I worked hard and was suc
cessful and tbaÂ£ started all. the trouble.
"The president of the Los Angeles Mer
chants' and Manufacturers' Exchange, a
man by the name of Zeehandler, sent
notices to: all of the members of that
organization not to buy their tickets from
me, but to patronize only' the agents of
the . Door of Hope.
"The .more tickets I sold the more
jealous the other women got. They were
afraid I would make more money than
did the Door of Hope. If I did, that was
my lookout."
Miss Hale Is charged by Pinkerton de
tectives with having worked the same
scheme and got Into, much . the same
trouble with a humane society, at boise,

FRESNO, Aug. 26. â By order of Pres
ident Percy A. Morgan of the Cali
fornia .Wine* Association, the' eight
wineries in Fresno County operated by
the association j were closed down in
definitely to-night. With the closing
came the announcement, that ...the
wineries would njot open' again unless
a concession from the .established*rev
enue rules is made by, the United States
Government.' "Nearly; all of "the -wine
made in California is manufactured, in
this section and* the: effect on the in
dustry will be tremendous.
Tho trouble came about through the
adoption by. the Government/of a new
and much more stringent set of internal
revenue rules. ' The wineries opened
for the season- only last Monday, but
conflict with the internal revenue offi
cers was met at once, the Scandinavian
winery being reported for irregularities
within- the week. ,
The irksome rules, an association ofn-:
cial stated to-night, are technical, in
their character and relate partially to
the manner of enforcing the wines:
They are suitable for the control of the
small wineries in;. the East, but not at
all so to the. large ones here.

engaged in the same year to play In con

The action of General Daniel E. Sickles

The cemeiery Is the burial place for

ajanded that the' body' of the dog" be
removed. Le6ter promised to bring the
Ttiatter before the cemetery trustees.

when the dog was buried or he would
have prevented it.
The trustees are not certain that
they can compel General Sickles to re

Mrs. Susie Itlchter. wife of John
Kichter, a 6tevedore employed at the
Pacific Mall dock, hanged herself at
their home. 1 Goodsell place, yesterday
afternoon. The unfortunate woman
had been suffering from consumption
and had made three previous attempts
to take her own life. On one occasion
she . tried to shoot herself, but was
disarmed. On another she took car
bolic acid, but was pumped out at the
Emergency Hospital, and on the last
occasion she tried to kill herself by
inhaling gaa.
When the husband came homo last
evening he found the house locked and
inquired of Mrs. A. Farrell, the next
door neighbor, where his wife was.
Mrs. Farrell replied that the woman
had been out of sight all day and
Richter passed to the rear of his resi
dence for the purpose of making an
investigation. On looking through a
kitchen window Richter saw his wife
hanging to a meat hook in the kitchen.
He forced the . rear door and quickly
cut the body down. It was cold, death
having ensued several hours before.
The Morgue deputies were notified and
an Investigation" was held.

Mrs/ Bfveefe; rheumatism settled in her right
knee. The knee was swollen to three or four
times ltf-rtatural size, ifwas perfectly stiff,
tbe . circulation had - almost e topped, and the
pain was unbearable. Her home j physrictan
nas giving her morphine that s-he might get
a little reet. The tissue about the knee turned
black, aa if gangrene would set in, and two
well-known and reliable physicians had advised
the sufferer to have the lear amputated above
the knee to cave her life. All this goes to
chow that the case of Mrs. FUvest was Just
about as bad as a case could be, and notwith-
standing the- severity, of It Electro-Coemlstry
cured the sufferer In two months' time at a
email cost. When we consider that during her
â¢ HÂ»'o months' treatment by Electro-chemistry
Â»he never experienced a mlnute'a discomfort
!r taking the treatment, and when we con-
sMcr that her great suffering wu lessened
from the ve.ry first treatment and that she did
not take "a : single dose of morphine after be-
Klnr.ir.R the Biectro-Cnemlc course, .it Is no
wonder that people talk of this wonderful cure
and that the happy cured patient is sending
everybody that ehe can hear of suffering with

LONDON, Aug. 26.â Whitney Tew," who
used to be a banker In Jamestown, N. V.,
where his father was a banker before
him, has considerably Interested London
by announcing that he is going to take
one of the high-price^ theaters in the
fashionable end of town 'the last of Oc
tober, and produce there an opera written
by another banker, Vincent Thomas.
Tew himself will sing the principal part
and apparently is selecting the cast and
managing the whole show himself, just
to give downtrodden and neglected Eng
lish grand opera a lift.
Tew says he was a banker! only be
cause he came of a family of bankers,
and it was a foregone conclusion" that he
would step into the shoes of 'his; father
as, soon as he had finished college and had
his "wanderjahre." \u25a0 But ; he " stepped ; out
of those shoes' as' fast as ever he; could,
fcr his tastes all ran in tho direction of
literature and music. He joined the old
National Grand; Opera Company, sang
pretty much all over the world inoratorlc
and concert work, and lately has : settled
down In London, where he is ; a well
known figure in the musical world. Some
time ago he "wrote the; litretto of a lyric
drama based on Dumas' "Three: Muske
teers," supplied the lyrics - and . sang the
role of Richelieu himself. "Also." he 'says,'
"I have been guilty of short stories and
lectures on art â¢ generally, an 4 the '*\u25a0 art
of singing." â¢ -
'Hie libretto for Tew's : rather daring
new venture has been built, on the King
Arthur legend ; by Ernest. Rhys, a Welsh
author of considerable' distinction.' :i The
title Is "G winevere." and the story deals
with the love affair between Sir Launcelot
and King Arthur's. .beautiful 'bride.:, i

PARIS. ; Aug. 26. â These are the
halycon days of the ; Parisian burglar.
The fashionable residential quarters ot
the city are practically deserted, save
by an occasional somnolent cpneterge
or domestic on board wages, and the
police are so taken up with the "puri
fication* of the central boulevards that
their attention Is somewhat distracted
from outlying sections. Statistics given
of the number of burglaries committed
during the summer 'months.'when "Pa
risians are out of^town, are almost ap
palling.'Two! hundred "burglaries daily
is the figure,' and the plunder is esti
mated at '4o,ooo francs $(8000) a day.
Were this :rate ' maintained the year

PORTLAND. Aug. 26.â Mrs. Adella C.
France of Los Angeles has lost her hus
band. She is very anxious to find him
and says she is willing to spend $40,000
If necessary . to locate her wandering
spouse. It was Mrs. France's . own
jealousy that drove France away. That
he had sqaundered $3000 of her fortune
at gambling tables did not cause Mrs.
France more than a momentary pang:. It
was when she discovered her husband
was going nightly to the beach with a
Portland woman .that her wrath waa
aroused and she upbraided France.
Now she Is sorry and writes from LO3
Angeles to Acting Chief of Police Qrttz
majcher:
"I have plenty of property, but I am
miserable. . My heart yearns for him.
I love H. S. France dearer than my
own life. I will forgive him if he will
come to me. He is mine and mine
alone. I want him. I love him and I
â¢will have him. Help me to locate him
and. l will pay you $500."
Mrs. France Is the daughter of Judge
Shelton of South Carolina. She Is well
known in Eastern society circles. Mrs.
France got a divorce from her first hus
band to marry her present spouse, who
Is a locomotive engineer.

completely gutted. \u25a0'-,\u25a0 -
, The ark was moored abont 300 feet

ing the absence of Harrington. Stron
anlch; states that he cooked his sup
i per about 8 o'clock. Then he lay down
! in '. his bunk and read r the paper until
Ihe fell; asleep. He was awakened by
.the dense smoke in his" room and he
I lost no time getting off the ark, as the
â¢ fire was burning . very briskly amid-
I ships.
The Sausalito Fire Department came
out in boat. s and assisted in removing
the personal effects from the ark. The
ark was scuttled in order' to save the
hull and Is now resting on -the bottom
in shallow water. The ark, which was
nicely furnished and liad . been recent

been subjected to the hazing, which
has become a fixture at the Institution
despite the efforts of the faculty to pre

committee on student affairs will usa
more strinerent means to compel the up
per class men to abate the severity of
former years.
It has been the custom In past years
for the sophomores to call a gathering
of the entrants in some conspicuous
place, and then pick some "green" ap
pearing candidate and elect him class
president. The unfortunate \u25a0 candidate
Is made the butt of the entire .college
community. This Is one of the customs
which will be abolished by the" faculty.

BERKELEY, Aug. 26.â The heart of
JCdge R. 8. Edgar was touched to-day
when little Laura Blake, a pretty 12-year
olfl girl, came into court, crying bitterly
and carrying In her band a savings bank
wblcli ene proposed to use In paying 1 ' her
flat lot riding a bicycle on the sidewalk.
ThÂ« savings bank contained exactly ,
U S5, all the money that Laura possessed.
aniTwith It she believed she could satisfy \
JuÂ»tlce and perhaps escape the possibility
of being- sent to jalL All of a child's ter
ror of "the Jail" was evident in Miss
Laura's face a* ehe stepped into Judge
Edgar's courtroom, and her tears flowed
freely tÂ» ehe made her way into the in
closure reserved for "prisoners at the
bar."
Little Laura, barely able to mount and
ride a wheel, was detected by a police
officer last night riding her bicycle on the
sidewalk near her home in North Berke
ley. She was arrested and directed to
come Into court to-day.
In the savings bank that Laura carried
â¢wae a collection of dimes, nickels, pen
nies, and a few quarters. The wealth rep
resented the child's idea of a fortune,
and yet ehe was prepared to give it all to
satisfy the demands of justice and go
free.
Judge Edgar smiled as the testimony
was beins taken In Laura's case, but
when thÂ« little maid put her box of
money on the table and sobbed out her
desire to "go home," the smile on the
face of the Judge faded away and some
thing suspiciously like a "mist of unshed
tesfs" came into his eyes.
"I guess. Miss Laura." eaid the grave i
and august court, "that you will not i
again violate the law. and that we won't !
have to take your savings bank money
to-day. You may go for this time."
To the clerk Judge Edgar said: "Judg
ment suspended in the case" of Laura,
Blake."
Sloon was taken to the Emergency Hos
pital at the West Oakland railroad yards,
where he was attended by Dr. W. H.
Sanborn. 'He was later removed to the
Southern Pacific Hospital at San Fran
cisco, where his leg was amputated. It
is feared that the shock of the accident
and subsequent operation will prove
fatal. -
OAKLAND. Au*. 26.â Failure . to see an
approaching train In time to get out of
the way, cost J. H. Sloon. a Southern
Pacific train gateman, the loss of his
right leg this morning, and so serious are
his injuries that It Is feared he will' die.
Sloon had just finished eating ] his
breakfast at the restaurant on the Oak
land pier this morning at 7 o'clock, and.
stepping from the door of the dining
room," started to walk 'across the tracks
to the ferry depot to take his train. He
did not see an approaching train , until
the engine was so close to him that Â«tt
was impossible for him to get out of
the way in time.
He was knocked down and the wheels
passed aver his right leg, crushing It
from the knee to the foot.'
John Hague has been appointed general
superintendent of the ship Interests of
the Standard Oil Company on this coast,
with headquarters at Point Richmond.
Mr. Hague has""been O'V here for a short
time and gradually assumed the manage
ment of the shipping interests. He will
not only have charge of all repairing of
vesjels, but also of the construction of
such new vessels as' may be needed.
This means that the oil shipping inter
ests of the coast â¢ will center at Point
Richmond. This is no inconsiderable mat
ter, for there are never less than two and
generally half a dozen vessels belonging
to the Standard Oil Company at the
wharves of Point Richmond. Aom now
on it is proposed to build the vessels that
are to be added to the oil fleet at the
Point Richmond yards. The keel of a 300
foot oil carrying barge was laid this week
and the shipbuilding works are now in
full operation.
OAKLAND, Aug. 28.â The Standard Oil
Company has established its shipyards
and the headquarters of its fleet at Point
Richmond. The company has decided that
it will have a fleet of oil carrying vessels
on this coast, and after much surveying
and Inspection a general superintendent
has been imported from the East ! :nd a
shipyard has . been located.
When the Standard Oil Company made
Point Richmond the site of its oil refinery
and the terminus of its pipe line from the
Kern County fields it became necessary
to have a shipyard to care for Its fleet of
oil [ carrying vessels. This fleet uid not
consist of simply the ships used for car
rying oil to and from coast ports, but was
composed of vessels that called at Orien
tal ports and island ports and ports that
stretched from Alaska , to Panama and
from Point Richmond to Yokohama.

Henderson, Junior deacon; r-Detective
George Kyte. steward: Officer Bert Cur
tis, steward; Officer Edward Crossman,

which conducted the ceremonies of
initiation had been especially, drilled
for the work by the master of the lodge
and Captain W. J. Petersen of the Oak
land Police Department, and the entire
ceremony was carried through, without
a hitch. So far as can be learned this
is the first time that a police officer, on
becoming a Mason, -has been raised to
the third degreeby a team of his
brother officers of the department.
At the conclusion of the initiatory
ceremony a banquet was held and every
member of the team extended a wel
come to the brother "officer _who had
just become a brother Mason. : A touch
ing feature of the banquet was the ad
dress of Major ; Charles Poulter. the
father of Officer Poulter. who said: .
"Ever since our boy became a man.
my son's mother and myself' have
anxiously awaited the day when he
should become a Mason* and I know
that she is patiently waiting at home
for us to return and tell her how her
son was raised to the third degree."
Addresses were also made by Mayor
Frank K. Mott. president of the Police
Commission: Captain W.- J. Petersen,
Captain Adelbert Wilson and other
members of the lodge. John W. Gwllt

having also stolen $68 from Charles : A.

Richter hurriedly told v Police Judge Fritz
how it came to pass, his hurry being oc

due to sail for foreign parts Just as soon
as he could get aboard of her.' While he
was admiring the art display in the win

of the exhibit consisted, : and, no /sooner

If -the Seattle baseball team manages
to grab a game from the Commuters
'the fans will say there is some
thing framed up. -With the teams play
.ing; ball as they are now doing, the
Si washes, do, not. figure to take one out
of a .hundred from the Oaks. It was
the same old story in the same old way
yesterday ' for - the fourth time without
a break, and it started off in the first
inning, as usual. \u25a0
'.. At , that Seattle did. not play bush
ball. They were simply up against an
aggregation \that had the' Indian sign
dangling over their heads all the time.
In the fourth inning-, when they man
aged ito get a full house without any
one.' down,'a''dummy play on â¢ the part
of Kane-prevented the scoring of a
bunch of runs and resulted in a double
play; instead, f
Kane opened up .this spasm a
two-cushioii drive over the third sack
and- Hart got- a walk. Houtz < beat out
a bunt, making It a full house. In the
midst of > the excitement Jimmy. Byrne3
pegged down to third to catch Kane off
,the bag. .The throw was wild and it
.rolled out to the' left garden.
"Kane started for home and, Dunleavy
grabbed the^; ball,- -winging it in to
Byrnes In a trice. Then the whole Oak
land team : got*! into the midst of the
fray and the " Seattle â¢ base runners
seemed bewildered. -Hart ran Kane off
at third and 'â¢ in the: mixup which fol
lowod Kane was -nailed at the. plate,
thus completing a double play on what
should' have * been : r a. large, and Juiby
bunch in the score column..
Oakland was hot slow to start, ."Van

so did- Dunleavy, -letting Van in.

Ing to the agreement, they ' are supposed'
to have. forfeited. the, sura of J2500 to Cof

' Both sessions were â¢ almost i funereal.
Brltt and' Nolan sat In opposite corners

"Misleading figures as to the extent of
the new crop have been circulated in tha
interests of the speculators. When accu
rate figures come in we shall consider
the situation and take whatever stepa j
may be necessary to meet It should the
supply prove less than the demand. We
are determined that speculators shall not y
control the market. As for the American
cotton growers, we have none but . the '
best feeling for them.. We wish them to
get a fair price for their raw material
and are willing to pay it. Even if the
most sanguine expectations of those en
gaged "in the ' movement for supplying
British. spindles with cotton grown with
in the British empire are realized, it
must be long: years before we are inde
pendent of the American supply."
"Of course, the question is a mora vital
one In England than to any other Con
tinental nation engaged In tha Industry,
because it is 'a vastly bigger one here.
While they manufacture chiefly for thele
own populations, wa send our goods to
millions In China and Indiaâ tha -poorest
people in tha world. When prices go up
they can no longer afford to buy. But
tha Continental manufacturers are la
hearty accord with 'us. Tha bond of self*
Interest unites us. *
"While American cotton, roughly
speaking, represents three-quarters of taa
world's supply, an artificial enhancement
of its price is followed by a similar. ln*
crease in the price of tha material from
other sources. The price at which Ameri
can cotton is held ' controls the market
price for tha rest of tha world. It is tog
that reason that wa have decided not toÂ»
purchase American cotton for thÂ» nextj
three months." . [:\
"But will the manufacturers bo able tat
get along without purchasing American
cotton for the next three "months?" I
asked. - .-.'.\u25a0
"That matter was thoroughly gone lnt*
at our meeting." replied Mr. Macara.
"We are in excellent shape to make tha
fight. Last year's crop was exceptionally;
good, and It has been estimated that
there will be at least 2,000,000 bales avail
able surplus to add to the new crop. R*Â«
ports made by members as to tha condi
tions prevailing In the countries repre
sented showed that tha European cotton
industries have on hand ample supplies
to cover their engagements '. for the next
three or four months. With possibly a
few exceptions, cotton spinners â¢do not
need to enter the cotton market before
the new cotton crop arrives at tha end
of October. What we propose to do.
therefore, is simply to keep out of it and
let the cotton speculators deal as best
they can with the situation they have
created. If some of them coma to grief
we shall shed no tears. It isn't going to
be our funeral this time.
"In the main the gamblers alone hava
profited by It. and manufacturers, opera
tives and consumers hava suffered by it.
The repetition of this sort of thing will
demoralize that whole Industry, inflict in
calculable loss and suffering and in
volve thousands in ruin. Now that wo
perceive the same speculative gangs are
at work again, and have already suc
ceded in greatly increasing tha price of
tha raw material wa' are determined to
exercise every means In our power to put
a stop to their methods. Wa confidently
expect that public sentiment In America
will support us. American cotton manu
facturers have the same Interest in get
ting the raw material at a fair price that
wa have. And so have the consumers.
LONDON, Aug. 23Lâ Representing not
only Great Britain, but all Europe, tha
International Federation of Master Cot
ton Spinners* and Manufacturers' Associ
ations has declared war against tha
American gamblers In cotton. That La
the meaning of the agreement reached at
the recent emergency meeting of tha a*Â»
Boclation. at which it was decided to
"strongly urge every cotton spinner In
Europe and America to refrain from buy-,
ing American cotton during the next
three months, except for lmmedlata
wants." It Is recognized here as the most
Important step ever taken by the repre
sentatives of the great cotton Industry to .
prevent an artificial Inflation of the prica
of the raw material, such as caused wide
spread suffering and loss when tho great
Sully corner was established.
While the statement wnlch was given
out. for publication at the conclusion of
tha meeting has already been cabled to
America, an Interview which I have Just
had with \V. C. Macara. president of thÂ»
association. ' who presided at the gather
ing, throws an Illuminating light on tha
objects aimed at, and the means by whlca
It is sought to attain them,
"I am particularly anxious," said Mr.
Macara, "that It should be understood
in America that this is In, no sense a
movement hostile to the American cot
ton growing Industry. The decision/
we have reached has been forced' upon
us by the necessity of taking some step)
to counteract the pernicious effect oa
the trade brought about by the recent
enormous enhancement of tha price, of
the raw material, due to tha action of
speculative rings. We are united and
we are in deadly earnest. Although
the meeting was summoned by tele
graph, it was attended by representa
tives of the association .from all over
Europe. The Master Cotton Spinners*
Association in England, of which I am
the president, alone stands for thirty
two million spindles. We deliberated
on the matter for over six hours before
we formulated our agreement.
"We hold that there Is nothing mora
Important for this great.- World- wide
cotton Industry than to rid It of tha
curse of gambling in its raw material.
Every penny per pound that is added
to the cost of the raw material by this
process represents an advance of many
millions of pounds sterling in the cost
of the world's supply. Last year tha
cotton crop was raised by this meansâ
I speak of average prices â from four
pence a pound, which would have
been a fair price, to seven penca
a pound. In American money that
means a raise In price from eight
cents to fourteen cents a pound. X
have calculated that it resulted in tak
ing out of the industry Â£100,000.000â
roughly speaking, {500,000,000 In your
money.

with Tommy Burns at Woodward's Pa
vilion on Thursday night. The gritty
fighter is within a pound or two of the
required weight and by cutting out the
daily i boxing Isouts he precludes .the
possibility :;of . injuring his hands, a
thing all fighters dread more than any
thing:else." -::'.
; Dave looks the picture of ruggedness
as he lounges about his. training place.
His gymnasium over at Croll's at Ala
meda is suitably adapted * to' the work
and his several trainers keep him on
the hop continually, : so he has but
little time to loaf. Of his fitness for
the coming battle there is no cause
for complaint and with his three weeks
of work the "muscles of his body are
like whipcord. Barry has had any
amount of practice with the gloves and
he has been very, fortunate in having
excellent sparring "partners in Alex
Greggains. George Lange and Tom Sul
livan. As to weight Dave can draw
the beam at "l6o pounds fiat and when
he starts to dry out Tuesday it will
bring;him to the stipulated 168 pounds
nicely.' i * ". . . .
i Tommy Burns entertained â¢ some
friends at his San - Rafael gymnasium
yesterday ' and " his boxing bout with
Warren Zurbrick was applauded* by the
visitors. ',; Burns is within three pounds
of the /weight.

to my position In connection with the ap
proaching ( election in the Olympic Club, I beg
to gay that, while I don't think the president
of the club phould take any. part In club
politics, there is no reason why he ehould not
votP for the ticket which has his full approval.
I r hall therefore vote fcr the .-regular- ticket

To the members of the Olympic Club,

As the. lntercollegiate committee on
football does not meet; until the first
of 'the year, it Is Impossible that the
desired change can be made. this year.
Manager Barrett does not anticipate
any objection to the proposed plan from
thos* In charge of the California affairs.
The argument which concerns the
team arid its ' equipment mostly is the
financial standpoint, which would be
greatly benefited by a change. Thanks
giving being a day upon which all
would be free to attend. \u0084
The beginning of practice later In the
season would give, the Cardinal an oppor
tunity to obtain games with -other col
leges, which at present Is almost Impos
sible, *as these desirable teams are not
organized so early in the year...
Obtaining the games with other uni
versities would obliterate the necessity
of ' post-season r games. This* custom has
been strongly protested by the faculty
and should act as a strong incentive .to
have the game returned to the original
date.
STANFORDUNIVERSITY. Aug. 26.â
The football : season- for _\u25a0 the eleven of
the Stanford .University, which will be
gin the first Monday afteV registration,
will bo extremely * short. The climax,
the V lntercollegiate "contest between the
Blue and Gold and the Cardinal. will come
on \u25a0 November 11. The" season will -be
shorter than. that of the*wearers of the
golden i"C'; by several weeks. The fact
i that : It opens so soon , after the begin
ning rof ; studies at the university has
caused Manager R. W. Barrett to look
for r a possible remedy. To. move the
big game back ;to the origmal day.
Thanksgiving, seems to fiU all require
ments.
The ; original - objection to the contest
taking place upon the holiday was that
raised by , the ; faculties of both universi
ties',; who; claimed the seasons were too
long.\The clergy objected when the games
were played In \u25a0 San - Francisco because it
created. \in their estlmatlo'n, a counter
feeling which was foreign to the proper
spirit . to ', be* observed upon the day of
thanksgiving. The matter finally reached
a - head .when ' the disaster at the athletic
grounds 'at Sixteenth , and Folsom streets
occurred. - Head Coach James Lanagan
and Treasurer, and Manager R. W. Bar
rett, who s both are ; strongly in favor of
the return -to the original day, have of
fered the : following, arguments to refute
those offered ; by the faculty : t
' If the date of the Intercollegiate con
test was ; set for Thanksgiving it would
not lengthen the season, as it would only
be necessary to begin the practice a lit
tle later. This arrangement would allow
all freshmen ample time to settle their
outside . affairs : and become familiar with
the routine of studies. â¢

Among- the crowd that tbronsed the
Pacific Mall wharf yesterday to wit
ness the departure of the liner Mon
golia for the Orient were many pretty
girls. There were more pretty grirls
among- the liner's passengers and the
radiant faces, bright costumes, Califor
nia blossoms and eunshine combined to
transform the freight-laden wharf into
a summer garden. The liner was
crowded with passengers and every
passenger appeared to have a score of
friends on the dock. Blossoms and
pretty faces fringed the liner's rail,
and lifted to the huge steamship as
she slowly glided away from her berth
was a sea of faces such as First and
Brannan streets had rarely seen.
Among the Mongolia's passengers
were all sorts and conditions of men.
Women and children. Governor Carter
is returning to Honolulu on the big
steamship. Lacey <jOodrich. who Is go-
Ing out to join the Toyo Kisen Kaisha's
liner America Maru, was also on board.
The America is going to resume her
place on the run between here and the
Orient and Lacey Goodrich is going to
be purser.
Captain Andrew Hall was a passen
ger on the Mongolia. He is going to
Yokohama to take charge of the steve
doring there for the Harriman steam
ships.
There were business men, Govern
ment officials, army and navy officers
end tourists among the passengers and
Â«very nationality under the sun seemed
to-be represented on the liner's broad
decks.
In the Mongolia's hold 12,000 tons of
general merchandise is stowed away.
6he left the wharf only a few minutes
late, being detained by the almost al
ways tardy office' mail. No United
Elates mail was left behind, the com
pany having seen to It that a sufficient
number of trucks to handle it all were
at the PostofÃce in ample time to In
sure Its early arrival at the wharf.
. As the liner moved away from her
berth somebody pulled out a watch and
remarked. "Pretty good; only five min
utes late."
And Alexander Center almost smiled.
