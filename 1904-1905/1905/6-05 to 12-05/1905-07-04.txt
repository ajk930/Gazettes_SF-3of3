TOPEKA, Kans.. July 3.â The First Na
tional Bank of Topeka, of .which C. J.
Devlin, the big coal mine owner, holds a
majority of the stock, failed to open its
doors this morning. No definite state
ment was obtainable regarding the condi
tion of the institution. W. H^ Rosfiln*
tuEy"Â»<n: prgSiggnt or^E<rTjanlcr"~locked
the books in the vault to await the ar
rival of J. T. Bradley, the national bank
pxair.infer, whom the Comptroller appoint
ed as receiver Rossington said:
'â¢The bank's trouble has not been
caused by dishonesty on the part of any
one. but by lending too largely to one
borrower. There has been no stealing." *
This borrower is, of course, Devlin, and
the bank is said to hold the capitalist's
paper to the amount of $1,000,000.
Devlin, whose sudden illness brought
about the tangle in his twenty-sir big
coal mining -and railroad properties,
valued at $7,000,000, is still under- the care
of a physician. He authorized the fol
lowing statement:
"No depositor of the First National
Bank will lose a dollar. I will give up
everything I own In the world if neces
sary to make the bank pay dollar for
dollar."
The statement was made to his at
torney, Clifford H. Husted, who was au
thorized to give It out for publication. It
Is added that Devlin expects to be able
to take active charge of his business
within a short time and will devote his
energies to straightening the tangle. His
physicians state that he will be able to
ro to his office within a week.
TURKS OVER HIS PROPERTY.
It was stated that the stricken coa!
operator had turned over to the bank
nearly $700,000 in life insurance and about
the same amount in Topeka real estate.
Business associates of Devlin gave It as
their opinion that, if properly handled,
this would allow the bank to pay its ob
ligations In full.
"State Treasurer T. T. Kelly has an
nounced that the bank held $508,000 of the
State's funds. Devlin is one of Treasurer
Kelly's bondsmen. The statement was
made that Treasurer Kelly k had exceeded
his authority in placing nlore of the
State's money In the bank than the law
allowed, but Kelly declined to discuss the
matter at this time.
Following the announcement! of the
failure a lively run waa started on the
Central National Bank and before closing
time to-day . something more than $100,000
had been withdrawn from this institution.
The Central National also holds some of
Devlin's paper. Devlin owns fifteen
twenty-eighths of the capital stock of
$250,000 of this institution.
When the officers of the Central Na
tional displayed $600,000 in cash and made
every tffort to pay the depositors as. fast
as they made demands for their money
the excitement subsided and at closing
time but a few small depositors remained
at the teller's window.;"
Other runs, of a lesser degree, were
started on the State Savings Bank, the
Bank of Topeka and on the Merchants'
National Bank. At none of these. banks,
however, was the demand for with
drawals great, only the small depositors
taking their money.^ Many of the heavy
depositors here- and the correspondents
throughout the State offered assistance
find some of the local merchants made
deposits.
OVERREACHES HIS RESOURCES.
J. R. Mulvane, president of the Bank
of Topeka, which kept open after banking
heurs to accommodate any who ; might
come for their money, spoke confidently
of the outcome, saying his . bank had
plenty of available assets. There was no
special show of excitement on the * part
of the depositors during the day, al
though a crowd remained about the doors
of the First National, as : . well as at. the
othfr banks, for many hours.
A rumor, which could not be verified,
was that the bank had $90,000 at .the. close
of the business Saturday. If it could have
raised $150,000 on Sunday it would have
opened to-day, It is said. The bank was
examined flvc months ago. It was In good
condition at that time..
It is stated on reliable authority, i that
the prime cause of C. J. Devlin's financial
troubles was the.Toluca'and Spring Val
ley Railroad, which he % commenced to
build in Illinois lately. The road took a

LOSS FROM

People Are Caught
by /Surprise in
Guanajuato.
Water Pours Down a
Ravine Into City
.With Wild Rush.
Â» â
Torrent Carries Occupants of
Hotel Away to I Their
Death.
GUANAJUATO. Mexico, July 3.â Five
hundred persons have perished and prop
perty valued at $1,&JO,000 has been de
stroyed as a result of the flood which
swept over the town, follov/ing a cloud
burst. Two hundred bodies have been
recovered.
Guanajuato, owing to its situation in a
great ravine or gorge, has been . sub
jected to floods sweeping down from the
mountains, and heavy loss of life has
been recorded in the past, but the present
storm, which began on- Friday night and
continued through Saturday, was un
precedented in violence.
By : 'A o'cock on Saturday afternoon
clouds banked up black and threaten
ing in the northeast and In less than
twenty .minutes :i ralh^:came > dowh in
torrents _ and the* watefr surged- down
the streets ; with great H-iolence. Part
of -the river, which was .built over^by
masonry, ; burst \ through, v . augmenting
the Hood and 'the. scene became one' of
terror and consternation. , T' . . Â«
The people made ? haste to t gather
their valuables and flee, and many, did
so at the risk of their lives, for the,
streets in the lower *part of the city'
were filled with' rushing waters and
the roar of wind and rain added to the
general panic. With one rush the
mighty flood burst H3 bounds, founda
tions of solidly built masonry and
houses being undermined and many
buildings fell with a crash. .
Their occupants In many cases . were
crushed beneath the falling masonry.
From the "center of the 'city the flood
rolled to both sides of the town and thÂ©
people madly rushed toward the moun
tains.
The second floor of the Hotel Union
was under five feet of water. Many
persons in the hotel were swept away.
At the time when' the storm seemed
likely to abate and before Its greatest
Intensity was felt, there was a crowd of
merry makers in the plaza. Gaming oper
ators bad scarcely set up their tables and
placed their money thereupon when the
flood rushed down from the hills, sweep
ing away booths, money and tables.
Many' people were then and there
drowned. Each ,man fought his way^ out
of , the flood, trampling down whomsoever
came ; In â¢ his ' way and thus many women
and children perished. - . . . . , .
A large number of people had sought
refuge in the church of San Diego, but
were crushed to j death under Its fall
ing walls. A priest, who was ad
dressing words of hope and consola
tion to the people, was killed. Four
hotels and some large* shops were de
molished or badly injured : and some
of the noblest \u25a0 mansions were demol
ished or badly wrecked with all their
rich furnishings. : The large building
occupied by Dwight \u25a0\u25a0 Furness as the
American Consulate, was flooded to the
second-story windows.
The street car. line -between this city
and the town of Marailfo was wrecked,
much of the track being washed away
and the mules drowned.
Thieves "are hazarding, their lives in \
pillaging shops and mansions.
The old; electric plant was destroyed,
but the new ; plant > was saved. The
mines were not damaged. The. famous
laolla dam is. intact. \ Many, people are
still camping in' the' mountains.

argument to the Jury was made to-day.
United States District Attorney Heney
occupied the morning and the early part
cf the afternoon in a powerful presenta
tion of the evidence on which the pros
ecution relied for conviction. In marked
contrast to the appeals made by the de
fendant's counsel to the sympathy of
the jurors, Heney addressed himself
strictly to the facts as shown by the
evidence.
Logically, tersely and with a vehemence
that besrÂ»oke absolute conviction of the
defendant's cuilt. he. rehearsed the proofs
of the prosecution. The specific charge
was that Senator Mitchell appeared be
fore the State Department to expedite
land claims for which his partners had
received fees. .
Heney concluded his argument at 2:35
o'clock this afternoon and Judge de Hav
en immediately delivered the instructions
to the jury
â¢ The gist of the statute under which
the indictment was brought, the court
held, was the receiving of money by the
defendant for services rendered. The
mere rendering of services was not suffi
cient to indict, for it was not unlawful,
but if he had knowledge at the time he
received- the checks from Tanner that
they were In part made up of the money
paid by Kribs and If hie had done the
work before the department expecting
compensation, then he was guilty under
the indictment. This fact was for the
jury to decide. ;.'v> .
TJhe Judge cautioned the Jury against
placing too much credence in circum
stantial and collateral evidence, though
at the fame time telling them that such
evidence should be given all the weight
deemed worthy by the jury. The fact
that the defendant had not testified was
not to be taken against him, for it was
his privilege not his duty to testify.
DISPOSES OF ESTATE
IX LETTER TO WIFE
Whether Document Is Valid

tion Befoi*e Court.
Fseclal Dispatch to The CalL
PHILADELPHIA. July 3.â Whether a
letter written by a man to bis wife and
written with" the realization that sudden
death may soon be his is a valid will is
what is to be determined in the Surrogate
Court in New York next Thursday. The
case Is an attempt made by the family
of Frederick A. La Roche, a wealthy au :
tomobllist and yacht owner, to break the
will written by him In a letter to his vite
three days previous . to an automobile
race in July two years ago. in which he
feared he might meet with a serious ac
cident. By the terms of the letter or
will. La Roche, who died In March of this
year, bequeathes to his wife all his cash,
securities and other > property, - to the
value of probably $1,000,000. No provision
Is made in the document for his aged
father.' Charles La RochÂ« of this city, or
Ms two brothers and" three Bisters, who,
with the father, are parties to suit to
break tho will. BBfiSnPH
The letter to his wife, who^. was in
Philadelphia at ther time. . told her that
three days later he intended to engage in
a speed contest and might* be killed. In
Inudlng her; not to. worry, he, states that
in the event of an accident. occurring he
desires her - to , have his entire : estate and
property. The accident, however, did not
occur and he lived until March of 1905,
when he died a natural death."
Mrs. La Roche produced: the letter T will
and attempted to probate lit and. opposi
tion was made by the relatives. â¢>

FROM PULPIT
NEW YORK, July 3.â Rev. David G.
Wylie, preaching last night on "National
Degeneracy," in the Scotch Presbyterian
Church, said:
Greed for sold Is almost universal In 'Amer
ica. To use an offensive term, "graft" seems
everywhere This craze for wealth- leads' to
cheating, stealing, lying and many -Immoral
features in business IKe. Here In New York
men have .tarnished their names by the man
ner in which they have dealt with the trust
funds of a great institution. Men. well known,
respected, high In commercial .and social sta
tion, hay taken fire into. their hands, 'and ; it
has burned them to tho quick. We have had
an exhibition of "high finance" pushed to the
limit. We need to imitate the municipal au
thorities of Glasgow in . the bank- scandal,
where directors of high standing were' sent
behind prison bars. The tiial anrl conviction
of guilty men who have' not scrupled to us.
wrongfully other peoole's money would -do
much to restore confidence In the majesty of
the law; for law ought to deal . in the same
manner with rich' and - poor. \u25a0
Even â¢at the -risk of . being called . sensa

the President of the United States in his deal
ing with grasping corporation; â¢ and \ ex-Presl

Addressing the Holy Name Society in
the Church of the Nativity, Brooklyn,
Rev. "J. J. Donlon said, among other
things:
In the business world it is difficult to flnd
men who are. honest according: to . the strict
interpretation of the : word. -.Within thepast
few months we have seen financiers, to whom
the people had unhesitatingly entrusted " their,
money, exposed fts knaves. \u25a0 _- .
People are no longer . surprised at dlehon
estyln high places. They have come to look
upon.it as a matter of. course and the . phrase
"tainted money" has ; become a byword" and
a Jest. We are accustomed ' to : breaches ; of
trust on the part of . office .holders and finan
ciers, but when' we. see these men show â¢ a
disposition even to use Judges of: the Supreme
Court to further their selfish' 1 ends it is ' time
to call a-halt. â¢ *

are permitted to exist because most - men dj

Relatives Quarrel j3ver Prop
erty Left by an Aged
OAKLAND, July 3.â Allegations of
fraud, undue influence and maligning
their uncle. , C. F. Murdoch", are made
against Dr. Charles F. Schulteis and his
wife, Sadie Schultela. by William Mur
doch and his wife. Catherine Murdoch.
These allegations are found In an answer
to a cross-complaint filed this morning by
the Murdochs in a suit to quiet title to
property on Thirty-fifth street, valued at
about $5000. * , â¢
..This property originally belonged to
William and Catherine Murdoch. They
deeded it to their son, C. F. Murdoch,
former deputy sheriff of Alameda Coun
ty, with the understanding that the deed
should not be recorded until after their
death. â¢ SubseQuently, according to Wil
liam, Murdoch and his wife. Dr. Schul
teis and his wife represented to them
that C. F. Murdoch was intemperate, and
that his occupancy of the premises on
Thirty-fifth street would result in the
damage of the place. Accordingly, Wil
liam Murdoch and his wife destroyed the
first deed, and made out another convey
ing the pr6perty to Dr. Schulteis and his
wife. There was a condition, however, to
the effect that the aged couple should
be cared for by the Schulteises as long
as they lived.
Only two months passed, allege the
Murdochs, when Mrs. Schulteis treated
her grandparents in such an inhuman
manner that they were compelled to dis
continue living with her. It was then
that William Murdoch and his wife
joined with their son, C. F. Murdoch, and
Brought suit to have the deed set asfde
and have the property restored to them.

f \u0084 at Engine.
BERKELEY, July 3.-Shaklng his baby
hands with glee at the oncoming engine,
and crying alound ; in his joy at j seeing
the cars so near him, little Teddy Allen;
son of C. R. Allen, was snatched from
the rails of the Southern Pacific tracks at
Delaware stpeet and Shattuck avenue this
morning Just in time to save his infant
life from being crushed out by the whirl
ing Berkeley train.
. His rescuer was Mrs. S. Hulin, who
saw the chi.d on the track. Risking her
own life to save the little one, the brave
woman ran to. the rails, and," grabbing
the baby -by its arms, threw it off the
track into the road and its life was saved.
Immediately after the narrowly averted
death *Irs. Hulin telephoned the police
that she had a , strange .baby on her
hands. Just a moment 'later a frantic
mother rang up the station -and said her
child had disappeared. The mother. was
informed that her babe was safe at head
quarters, and in a few minutes she was
there to claim it. A glad scene was that
between mother and child. With tears of
joy Mrs. Allen hugged'and' kissed the lit
tle one, while the babe complained, to his
mamma that "a bad lady had spoiled his
play." â¢ ' â¢
The chad had wandered from his home
at Vine street and Shattuck avenue while
his mother was attending, to her; house
hold duties. . In his hand he held a large
wooden ring, which he was waving in joy
at the approach of, the train., He was
astride the rail, playing hobby-horse
when Mrs. Hulin, who chanced to be
passing, caw tbe danger, and by" quick
presence of mint saved the babe from the
grinding wheels. The corner is not much,
frequented at that time of day, and it
was only the merest chance that .brought
the woman to the spot at that moment.

peror Nicholas Is sending. Russia's pleni
potentiaries to "Washington In perfect
good faith is j demonstrated not only by
the fact of his. clothing them " with full
powers to negotiate and conclude a
treaty, but in his appointing several high
officials (five. It is believed) who are spe
cialists In various branches of the sub
jects connected with the negotiations as
advisers of the Russian plenipotentiaries.
In this way the delays incident to refer
ring peace propositions back to St. Pe
tersburg for consideration of the various
Ministers, which always cause a loss of
much time in Russian diplomacy, will be
avoided. Japan is likely also to pursue a
similar plan.
The retirement of War Minister Sak
haroff marks the final overthrow of the
\u25a0war party.
At the Foreign Ministry it was stated
\u25a0 that, if a treaty were signed by the pleni-.
potentiaries In Washington, it' would be
referred to their respective governments
In Tokio and St. Petersburg for ratifica
tion and would become operative, bo far
as Russia is concerned, when Bigned by

âDear Sir : I was interested In readi ng \ your

Owing . to the bitter and - active . opposition
on . the . part of . certain ; elements \u25a0 In ) the ! State
Legislature and owing, to x the vast } number
ot bills presented for consideration at the' last
session, the act receding the valley only passed

Governor: two days before Congress adjourned,
Senator Perkins, the | Secretary of the Interior
and others : : . were \ notified -; by .- wlre.^ c - Senator
Perkins," at. the request -'of - the 'â¢ Secretary,
hastily prepared an amendment - to : the s sundry

received \u25a0' favorable : action >in â¢-< the/ Senate,' but
for ' some " reason failed â¢ In . the * House. â¢/_â¢ At f al-;

was eliminated and only, the appropriation was

CHICAGO. July i.â Effort* are ta be
made by the < packers lndlcatad. by th.Â«
Federal Grand. Jury to defeat the Gov
ernment's aim through Injunction papera.
The novel spectacle of def endanta,
charged with criminal offenses, seeking to
restrain the prosecution ; from proving
any violations of the law bythem may be
seen In the United States Circuit Court
before the end of the month,
The "packers thought It all over lons
ago,, anticipating their Indictment, and
have authorized their special counsel.
John . S. Miller, to file . their petition ' for
an ' injunction at his discretion. In fact
notice informing; the Federal officials
that the petition would be filed asklssr for
an injunction has been prepared for serv
ice. Miller said that the action seeking
an injunction would be uncommon, but
not without v precedent, cases being on
record supporting- the contemplated movÂ«
by the packers.
V "The form of action has not been thor
oughly considered or thought out." said
Miller, "but that wilj be settled later. My
clients will ask for an injunction against
prosecution under the indictments -on the
grounds that prosecution \u25a0 will be Irregu
lar. It Is a well settled rule of law that
where a plaintiff gees Into a court of
equity seeking an Injunction and obtains
it the same plaintiff cannot "* institute
criminal proceedings against the defend
ant. The packing firms are now under an
Injunction made permanent by Judge
Grosscup In the Circuit Court. If they
have violated that injunction, they ought
to be - cited for contempt before that
tribunal Instead of being . indicted in the)
United States District Court."
District Attorney , Morrison and Assist

from the city to-day and their opinions
could not be obtained on the new mova
to be made by the packers. .

Special Dispatch to The Call.
EEXO. July 3.â]farvm Hart became tlie champion
heavy-weight boxer of the world this afternoon by land
ing a knockout punch on Jack Boot's soler plexus in the
twelfth round of a vicious fight. Hart looked like a loser
up to the moment he whipped in the lucky blow. The
victor showed no class and was outboxed by the van
quished man from the start. Â» [X

RENO. July 3.â After being outboxed
tnd outfoijght for twelve rounds Marvin
Hart of Louisville, Ky., scored a sudden
end sensational victory this afternoon
over Jack Root of Chicago in their cham
pionship battle.
Hart had been badly punished through
out the fight and had been knocked down
tt the end of the seventh round, and it
â¢eeined oniy a matter of time when Root
would wear him out. The men had been
battling all over the ring for two minutes
in the twelfth round, when Hart sud
denly sent his right straight to R*oot's
solar plexus.
The blow sounded to the spectators al
most like the pop of a pistol, and its ef
fect on Root was Instantaneous. He
dropped to his knees, and with his face
distorted wit- pain he clutched at his
body with one hand, while with the other
he held the lower rope oÂ» the ring and
made rain endeavors to regain his feet.
He seemed to know even in the ter
rible babel which went up from the elec
trified spectators that the fatefut sec
onds which spelled defeat were being
tolled off by the timekeeper, Frank Shor
ten. He put forth superhuman efforts to
regain his feet, but all to no purpose.
When the ten seconds allowed by the
Queensberry rules had been counted off
he was still unable to reach an upright
position.
CROWD SWAHMS L\TO RISC
The end of the fight was almost identi
cal with that of the one between Fitz
simmons and Corbett at Carson eight
years ago, with the exception . that this
'Jme the decisive blow was a right hand
to the delicate nerve center of the body,
while the blow which won the champion
ship for Fitzsimmons was a left to the
body. The spectators rushed . over one
another In their mad endeavor, to get into
the ring. This was soon a seething,
struggling mass of humanity, every mem
?icr of which seemed bent on congratulat
ing the new champion.
Over In Root's corner the scene was a
rathetic one, the clever boxer, ; who but
a few moments before seemed about to
carry off the palm of: victory, was
stretched out' in his chair, gasping for
breath- He was surrounded by his sec
flnds; vrho did their best to restore him
to complete consciousness.
While Hart was receiving the congratu
lations of his admirers one spectator-tried
to grasp his . hand and - the i act .was \ re
sented by the champion. What eve? passed
between them Hart struck at the specta
tor and he stepped â¢ to.the flopr}and was
then bundled out of the ring. =by the
seconds. .Â» â¢ . ':
The fight was far from, being of 'class.
Hart especially showing an "entire" lack of
brilliancy in boxing. He swurig'wildly
time after time and his blows generally
seemed to lack direction. "
HARTS SECOXDS ; CLAIM FOUL.
The clear break clause in the rules ef
fected him materially, as It eliminated all
the infighting, the ', only , branch :of i.the
came in which be appeared able to inflict
punishment, until " he , scored : his decisive
Victory. Root on^the other hand ehoweo
all his old-time cleverness. He jabbed
with his left and sent his. right In with
unerring accuracy through the fight.
As was expected both men infringed the
rule regarding hitting in the 'clinches.
They also seemed loth to break at the
order of Referee Jeffries and after a time
the big fellow had to go between them
frequently to separate them.
Almost simultaneously with the sound
of " the bell ' signaling the end \u25a0 of the
seventh round Root caught Hart a right
flush on the jaw. The blow did not seem
to take Immediate effect and Hart \u25a0 stood
holding the upper rope on the north side
of the ring for an Instant. Ills face as
sumed a blank expression and before his
seconds could reach him he sank slowly
to the floor of the ring.
There were loud cries of foul from all
sides and Hart's principal second, Ja^c
McCormick, rushed up to Referee Jef-

.He said afterward that he heard the
bell and dropped his guard. Just at that
instant the blow, landed and nezrrly ended
the affair, then and there. Earlier in; the
contest, near the end of the third rounds
Hart claimed a foul on a ' left hand to

â¢ npHE greatest free society the world has g ever known to-day ceie-
I brates its foundation, and signalizes its keeping of the faith
â¢*â¢ of its fathers. The distant beginning was small and incon
. spicuous in even-thing except the spirit that animated the men who
defied power, faced death and challenged the greatest of the na
tions to combat. - ,
They were not seeking glory nor aggrandizement for them
selves. The path in which they set their firm foothold was more,
likely to lead to the gibbet than 'to glory. They staked all, risked all,
I and they won. Their achievement was more for the future than for
* their own time. In the order of nature but few of them survived
to see the perfect work of their hands. To some prophetic spirits
among them came a vision of what was to be. But they were all
content merely to lay the foundation and to point the way for
generations that were to follow.- The building upon what they
prepared has gone beyond any dream. Free institutions have fol
lowed the progressive intelligence, of the people, and now liberty^
regulated by law, is the firmly fixed habit of nearly 100,000,000*
people. ',;.'. - v , râ¢' "\u25a0 '
In other ages great changes were -wrought on the face of
nations by vast invasions of strange and warlike people", who came
to devastate and staved to build new institutions upon the ruins
they had made. But what we have done in the 129 years since
* the' Declaration of Independence was signed is the greatest in
stance in history of orderly growth from weakness to glory, great
ness and power. The spectacle of so many millions, living, pros
pering and peaceable under the laws made by themselves elevates
and chastens the spirit of the beholder.
. Pride raises a high note in the breast of every American now.
We are the peacemaker of the world. Our President, the successor
of Washington, has brought peace in sight between two of the most
ancient Governments of the world. The successor of Rurik, more
than a thousand years down the line, and of Jimmu, direct in de
â¢ scent through 2565 years, yield their warlike spirit and put their
future peace in the hands of our Government, which had no ex
# istence 130 years ago!
.We have made material conquest of the world. The industry
and ingenuity of our people have been the key to open the re
â¢ motest markets. We have recorded our triumphs in literature, art
and science, and the world has found its respect rising above- its
envy. But this latest achievement of peace between Russia and
Japan has the respect of the nations, and their praise has no tinge
of envy.
We have attained great exaltation, but the observance of this
anniversary of our small and heroic beginning proves that we have
not forgotten the level from which we have climbed. It is natural
that freemen shall dream and prophesy of change in the institutions
that guarantee their liberty. Such visions are seen by some cJf our
countrymen. Others sometimes fear this spirit of experiment and
uneasy desire for change. But the very success of our institutions
is' the strongest argument against. a change. It is probable that 129
years from to-day Americans will be looking back upon 258 years
of freedom and growth, under an unchanged form of representative
government, and will hail it as the best adapted to the happiness
of man. - >, .'.."\u25a0*
THE DEAD SECRETARY.
IT is difficult in any form of words to utter the profound sorrow
and sense of loss that are upon the people because Secretary
Hay, is no more. The patriotic exultation of this anniversary
of freedom is muffled because that great fellow citizen of ours can
serve his country now only by the example of his life, which will
long survive him.
. He had served his country usefully and unselfishly in so many'
ways. that the gratitude of his countrymen finds difficult the ex
pression of their obligation. He was a Western man. His early
life was spent on a farm in Illinois. His acquaintance with Abraham
Lincoln began when he was a boy, and that- chance contact i was
the beginning of his career. His services as a diplomat have been
formally told. His latest triumphs are fresh history. But one in
cident in his career has not been mentioned, although it brings
his persuasive arts and his genius as the diplomatist of peace into
focus.
When the boundary dispute between Great Britain and Vene
zuela, after incubating for sixty years, became acute, Mr. Cleveland,'
mindful of the Monroe doctrine, asked that Great Britain .arbi
trate. This was curtly refused, by Lord Salisbury, and American
feeling at once ran high and hot. Then Mr. Cleveland did a; bold'
and unexpected thing, by sending to Congress his special message
on the subject. After saying that the Monroe doctrine "is essential
to the integrity of our free institutions and the tranquil main
tenance of our distinctive form of Government/and cannot become
obsolete while our republic endures," President Cleveland asked
Congress for authority to appoint an American commission to de
termine the disputed boundary, and to make report, and that when
such -report -was made to prepare "to resist by every means in our
power, as a willful aggression upon our rights and interests, the
appropriation by Great Britain of any lands or the exercise of go v->
ernmental jurisdiction over any territory which after investigation
we have determined of right belongs to .Venezuela." i
This was a bold and novel assertion of our national rights, and
it was denounced as high-handed by the British press. The two
nations have not been as near war since the embargo. /Then it
was that John Hay, as it is known, upon the suggestion of an ad
ministration opposed to him in politics, visited London, and by his
persuasive arguments made the Salisbury Ministry see ''that it : . : wasj
in the wrong and j:hat Mr. Cleveland was not only in the:righti:but
that he would persist even to war. Just then the â¢Jameson Vraidi on
the Transvaal occurred, and American citizens were concerneduri '*; it-
Mr. Cleveland' recognized the suzerainty of Great ; Britain' in the
Trans\-aal by placing the Americans under : British /protection, and
Lord Salisbury was able to save his face and, yield to. the persuasion
ofÂ» John Hay by granting arbitration of the boundary dispute.
It was a time of very great tension between** the two Govern
ments, and in diplomatic, circles it has always been believed that
without the services rendered by Mr. Hay war would' have been
inevitable. Looking back to that time, we can appreciate the mag
nitude of .that service. He was then only a private citizen; a plain
American, but he upheld the position taken by his country and
accomplished its most extreme purpose without shedding a drop
of blood.
'So in private and public life he was watchful of his country's
interests and mindful of her honor, andbefore the close' of^his;life
had made the greatest impression upon the international affairs of
the world that has been made by any diplomat. : He' established a
new diplomacy, by asking only, what was fight* and persisting until
he got it. -, This diplomacy will" not 'die '.with, him,; for- man in .many
nations has felt its benign touch, and will not consent to: return to
the old diplomacy of intrigue and false pretense. *

raise up others" like him. ,; :, . . â¢ :". : ' â¢- \

. Heigho! but I cllngtq it, the memory
of those . independence days of old. I
cling to it, for it Is the shadowy em- t

worl6*and- 1 am its victim. little
things' thrill me no more: and even the
big things betray an inclination to be
come > iensationless : and , dull. - \u0084
This is why I hold' with something
like a death grip to the 'memory of
Fourths of July and. Christmas days/

and for whom I ate my three' "square

have not; that boy still Is the best part
of my existence and I cannot Â§ afford
completely to lose my hold upon .him.'
Should I do so I should be a rather
callous citizen. .
As for the firecrackers." etc., being
dangerous in a degree, j to. be sure they
are, but, is it not better for. the boy: to
face that limited danger "than ,to^ be

One started across the < meadowland
of life and as he" walked the" sunlight
of the morning was all about him." The
birds sang for him and he loved. their
songs. The flowers V budded and \blos
somed along his path and he ; deemed
their: fragrance ; good. , And .he cried,
"Life is sweet;"it is very sweet"" \u25a0:) "
And still he journeyed on ' and on.-. ;
And as he journeyed the glare'of;the
noonday sun' was upon him and he* said
to himself. "I find' thatHhere is such" a"
thing as overdoing this sunshine.busi

And the flowers still budded and
bloomed, . but he whispered I to ; himself,
"They, are " the" same" old i flowers "with

that they become chestnutty. -If 'they

And the birds yet sung/but he mut
tered to himself, "It's ; the same dratted

A BAD BREAK.
During the annual convention, .of a
certain religious body not so very lons
ago an incident occurred which was not
on the programme and which complete
ly - upset the ,'grraylty of the minister*
and brethren assembled. It was at the
closing session, and the chairman stated
that they were about one hundred dol
lars short of an amount desired to be
raised for a given purpose, and hoped
that the. sum .could be made up before
final adjournment. One of tho laymen
jumped up with the remark:
â¢Til start the good work with twen
ty-five dollars." -
"I 'don't know" your name, brother/*
said. the chairman, "but.may.God blesa
you," and may, your business be doubled
during the year." . :.."". ; \u25a0
Much to his astonishment, a burst or
laughter: followed . from many" in' tha
hajl, which was : explained when a
brother up Jn front stepped to the plat
form-and. whispered: -
.".Why/that's Mr. Blank.. a prominent
undertaker of the town."â Lipplncott's.
CONVERSION.

not money.be born again? Why shoul it

rather say that while the light- holds
out to burn the vilest money, may re
turn? ' Should there not be "more joy

ninety-nine that need no repentance?"

TO ARRIVE HERE LATE THIS AFTERNOON.
Arrangements Are Complete for Entertainment of Visitors
Manchuria Refitted
to Go Across
Pacific.
Miss Roosevelt to
Occupy a Hand
some Suite.
Secretary Taft and party are expected
to arrive in San Francisco late this att
craoon. The special cars occupied by the
distinguished visitors are* attached to
train -Xu. l, which is due to arrive here
a.l bAH p. m. a
Secretary Taft will be met at Benicla
by Major Cassius E. Gillette, chief en&l
r.rtr officer. Pacific Division, and Colonel
\%'. H. Heuer, engineer corps. Both these
officers go to meet ihe Secretary ai this
point at his request.
It might be conjectured from this, that
the Secretary wants to discuss with these
engineers the question of the feasibility
of building the bridge across the Straits
of Carqulncz that the Southern Pacific
Railroad is so anxious to build. The ques
tion of permitting the erection of the
bridge hits been agitating the authorities
at Washington for some time. â¢
There also might be something of sig
nificance In the fact ttiat Manager
Scirsverin of th L Pacific Mail Steamship
Company is in his private car attached
to the train that brings the Secretary
â¢here.
G%Y T13112 HERE.
The arrangements for the entertain
ment of Secretary Taft and Miss Roose
velt during their sojourn here are prac
tically complete. The apartments for
the party at the Palace are the most
sumptuous that the hotel can provide.
This morning they will be decorated with
magnificent flowers.
It is intended to make Wednesday the
army day, instead of Friday as origin
ally Intended. This will give the "Secre
tary a much longer time to see and in
spect thÂ«= different points about the bay.
It is proposed now to have the party
leave town early In the morning on the
tug Slocum and first visit Angtl Island
to let the Secretary look into the question
of allowing the Treasury Department to
use a portion of the place set apart for
them for an emigration detention camp.
From --ngcl Island the tug will go by
Alcatraz. Fort Baker and Fort Mason
and then proceed to the Presidio. Here
the party may land, and it . is possible
there may be a review of the troops
stationed at that post.
I-at" the same afternoon there- will
probably be a large reception at the St.
Francis, attended by the army and navy
folks stationed here, tendered by Gen
eral Samuel S. Sumner to the visitcrs.
Thursday the trip to the Bohemian Club
camp, where the visitors will be the
guests of Mr. and Mrs. A. \V. Foster.
will take place.
Thursday night win occur the banquet
tn be given to Secretary Taft at the
Palac*.
Friday night is set apart for the- ball
to be tendered to Miss Roosevelt by Mrs.
Kleanor Martin *t. her -beautiful hDme=cn
Broadway. y
Saturday at 1 o'clock the party will sail
away for the Orient.
MISS ROOSEVELT'S SUITE SUPERB.
The Pacific Mail steamship Manchuria,
which Is to convey the party, has been
on the drydock and is as bright and clean
as the day she made her first trip. All
the cabins have been freshly painted.
Those of Miss Roosevelt, her chaperone
irid the" young ladies who are her guests
have been decorated and embellished so
that they are the equal of any of the
finest apartments of the Atlantic liners.
Miss Roosevelt's suite 13 particularly
handsome- It iÂ» painted In white and
gold, with all the furnishings and fittings
to match. It is as rich and as elegant as
the company could make It.
When the Manchuria steams away on
Saturday there will be a great gathering
on the Mail dock. Society will be out in
force, while General Sumner and staff,
General Funston and staff and all the
principal army and navy officials will be
on hand. The Third Artillery Corps band
will be there to play the national airs.
and altogether the "send off" as pro
posed will be such as is worthy of tbe
high official of the Cabinet and the daugh
ter of the chief executive of the land.
With the party will go at least >four
reputed suitors for Miss Roosevelt's
hand, and it may be that when the fair
maid of the White House returns Mr.
GRAPE-XPTS.
FROM THE EDITOR.
He Fcrcot That He Had a Stomach.
Talking of food, there is probably no
professional man subjected to a great-
er, more â¢wearing'' 1 mental strain than
the responsible editor of a. modern
newspaper.
To keep his mental faculties con-
stantly In good working order the edi-.
tor must keep his physical powers up
to the highest rate of efficiency. Noth-
ing will Â»o % quickly upeet the whole
system as badly selected food and a
.disordered stomach. It therefore fol-
lows that he should have right food,
\u25a0which can be readily assimilated. a.nd
which furnishes true brain nourish-
ment.
"My personal experience in the use
ot Grape-Nuta and . Postum Food Cof-
fee," writes a Philadelphia editor, "so
exactly agrees with your advertised
claim as to their merits that any fur-
ther exposition in that direction would
seÂ»m to be superfluous. They have
benefited me 6O much, however,' during
the five years that I have used them,
that I do not feel Justified In withhold-
ing my testimony.
"General 'high living* with all that
the expression Implies aa to a gener-
ous table, brought about indigestion, in
ray case, with restlessness at night and
lassitude in the morning, accompanied
l>y various. pains and distressing sen-
stuions during working hours. The
doctor diagnosed :,the condition as 'ca- |
tarrh of the stomach/ and prescribed
various medicines, which did; ma no
good. I finally 'threw physics to. the
<2ogs,' gave up tea and coffee and heavy
m*at dishes and adopted ' Grape-Nuts
and Postum Food Coffee as the 'chief
articles of my diet-
"l can conscientiously say, : and I
wish to say it with all the emphasis
possible to the : English language, that
they have benefited me as medicines
r. ever did and more than any other food
that ever came on my table: .; My ' ex-
perience is that the Grape-Nuts ; food
has steadied and strengthened both
brain and nerves to a, most positive de-
gree. How it does it I cannot say.' but
I know that after breakfasting 'on
Grape-Nuts food one actually forgets
he has a stomach, let alone 'stomach
trouble.' It is, in my opinion,. the most
beneficial as well as the most economi-
cal food 'on the market ; and has abso-
lutely, no . rival." . Name 1 given by
Postum Co., Battle Creek, Mich. :
There's a reason.?
Roosevelt will be called upon to dispense
a blessing. These four young men, who
are to make the trip as unofficial mem
bers of the party, are Stuyvesant Fish
Jr., young Mr. Stillman, K. Wet
more, son of Senator Wetmore of Rhode
Island, and Congressman Nicholas Long-,
worth of Ohio. WPtmore is already
here, having arrived at the Palace sev
eral days ago.
W. J. Johnston, proprietor of the
American Exporter, reached San Fran
cisco yesterday and is registered at the
Palace. He will sail as an unofficial
member of Secretary Taft's party. Mr.
Johnston's paper takes a deep interest
in the market for American manufac
turers abroad. It is to personally study
the opportunities for the sale of Ameri
can goods in the Orient that he accom
panies the Taft party, instead of re
turning with the others, Mr. Johnston
expects to go on to Australia and New
Zealand with the same object in view,
coming back to San Francisco from
Auckland.
IS BEST OF SPIRITS.
OGDEN, July 3â Secretary Taft and
party, en route for the Philippine Isl
ands, passed through Ogden this after
noon, leaving for the West over the
Southern Pacific at 4:45.
Secretary Taft was in the best of spir
its, and spent the entire forty-five min
utes of. the stay- here in -conversation
wlih the newspaper men. * v "*
"I do not expect to become Secretary
of State," ho said. "The President has
instructed us to go on and .we are going.
The reason for the trip is to look into
the. question of transportation for the
Philippines. The purpose of getting a
number of Congressmen to make the
trip is to give them a concrete idea of
what we have over there."
When asked what the effect .would be
of the President's instructions regard
ing the handling of the Chinese by the
immigration authorities, he said:
"We hope that this will settle the
matter and stop the complaints from
that source. To have the Chhinese stu
dents and merchants come here gives us
a great hold In China."
He repeated that the Wallace affair
was a thing of the past, and added:
."Fortunately we had a good man for' the
place and put him in the position."
A large number of civilians met the
party upon its arrival here. The spe
cial train is In charge of R. S. Roble,
traveling passenger agent of the Union
Pacific,
\VASHIXGTO"V SCHOOL PUPILS
ARE TO BE ACCOMMODATED
Twelve Clans" Rooms Will Be Built In
Two Adjoining: Hoaxes Pending
Erection of ATevr Structure.
The Board of Education yesterday
directed its carpenters to make alter
ations to the two buildings adjoining
the "Washington Grammar Sch'Â«Â»l so
that they may be available for use
when the school terms begin next
month. Mr. Carmody estimates that
the alterations can be made for a small
sum and twelve rooms will 'be util
ized pending the razing of the old
school building and the erection of a
new structure to cost $119,000 under
the bond issue. The houses on the lots
adjoining will be torn down when the
new building is finished and the lots
will be utilized for additional play
grounds.

Those who have been complaining that

TOWN OF ST. HELENA
. IS VISITED BY FIRE
Flames Start in Laundry and
Threaten Destruction of
Many Buildings.
Stwclal Dispatch to Th* Call.
ST. HELENA, July Â«.â What tor a timÂ»
threatened to be one of the most disas
trous fires r erer seen in St. Helena Â»c- *
curred here to-day, and only through' ths
excellent Work of the fire 'department
was great loss averted. The blaze started
in the laundry back of the Windgor Ho
tel. The flames spread rapidly to other
buildings of inflammable character and
reached a large barn . owned by Mrs.
Richie. Much hay was stored there and
this gave the fire great headway. It was
miraculous that - the hotel escaped de
struction. If the fir* had spread to the
hotel many buildings in the heart of town
would have been destroyed.
One of the firemen was prostrated by
heat. . While the fire was raging the ther
mometer read 102 in the shade.
Some strikes are just, others are not.
We ask you to Investigate . thoroughly
both sides of the question of the-Rain
ier" strike and see if you do not agree
with us that some strikes are unjust. â¢

FREIGHTER SHORT L Y^tiM CONVERTED INTO OIL BURNER
Falls of Dee Is at
Montevideo in !
Distress.
Uner Alameda Due
To-Day From
Honolulu.
The American-Hawaiian Steamship
Company's big freighter Texan, Captain
William Lyons, arrived here yesterday
flfty-nlnÂ« days from. New York. The
Texan called at Coronel for coal and at
San Dleg-o, where she discharged about
2000 tons of cargo. For this port she
has 5 000 tons of general freight, which
6he began discharging yesterday about
noon.
When the Texan returns to New York
she will be taken out of commission and
turned over to an army of mechanics,
who will convert her Into, an oil burner.
The success of the Alameda and Marl
posa, the pioneer ocean liner oil burn
ers, has led to the substitution of liquid
ruel in many cases, and nowhere with
better results than on some of the other
big freighters of the American-Hawaii
an line.
XUth oil for fuel these Immense cargo
carriers make better speed and save the
time and expense of refilling coal bunk
ers at CoroneL In addition to this, they
S'ilk 7 !.* 11 .? 6 Other that go
with liauld fuel. The Texan has been
one of the most successful of the com
pany s vessels, and with oil her value
will increase, as the change will mean

.Rose, and Louise -Matthai of 3319 Mis
sion street, having. lost all hope of ever
finding; an honest \u25a0 lawyer, ; decided recent
ly.to. handle by>.themselves a suit involv
ing, property .worth nearly a quarter of a
million - dollars. With no , outside - help
thÂ£y : prepared r a forty-four page tran
script,' which they nled In the Supreme
Court 'yesterday. The ladies
have been sorely troubled through a lack
of .technical ; information, . and all the -< at
taches ' of, the . State's : highest tribunal
have^boen called, upon 'at; frequent inter
vals V to j answer ; innumerable ' questions'
connected with the filing of the important
.documents. â¢
: The Misses. 1 MattHai have passed the
heydey, of their youth, but, they have all
the" force and'; 'ambitions j'of ' girls of"; 1$:
They believe that all the lawyers and all
their opponents in various legal contests
are as crooked as mountain trails... Even
Judges : and .other public officials who
have followed. the law as a means of live
lihood also come' under'.the ban. :.;".
It appeals | that the Matthai family, has
lived â¢ for ; ten | years on ja â¢ ranch - in ; Napa
County.^ r Several , years ago they discov
ered 'th"at J strangers were . quarrying car
bo nate";of : magnesia on what they allege
is their. property. \u25a0'"â¢.: . Then the lawsuits com
menced.' Frank Matthai, a 1a 1 brother of the'
Portias, killed, G.'C. Stanley, representing
the quarrymen, on May.29, 1900. After. two
trials he : was j acquitted through \ the ef
forts '. of hi* sister. Roseâ that Is, accord
ing ,to Rose's version. . Louise .echoes
everything Rose, says. ,;V>- , . -.':_ .
'Abel r' : McFarland, \u25a0 \ . the
quarrymen, instituted an aption for eject
ment the and In
the" lower courts. Then the* ladies took 'up
the legal. cudgels in their own behalf and
filed their; appeal to the Supreme Court.
They, presented their transcript '.' at the
clerk's ; office yesterday afternoon just in
time to save losing their case on default.
Rose says she' will appear in person and
argue her case before the Supreme Court,
unless: she can .find an" honest lawyer.
Diogenes did not so far restrict his en
deavors. "\u25a0\u25a0'-â¢\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0" \u25a0 v
. Rose, supportefl sotto voce by Louise,'
avers that the -* lawyers .who. represented
her- brother sold' them out;-that the Judge
before iWhora. the criminal and civil cases
were tried was also dishonest.; . ' ;,".
The last lawyers employed by : the fam
ily | proved untrustworthy, - and' that' the
surveyors * and their, employers \u0084were; not
brought up to distinguish lies from truth.
' What Rose, sustained , by Louise, : , thinks
of ex-Congressman Bell, who was prose
cuting attorney in â¢; their brother's trial,
and who represents the opponents in-ihe
present litigation, is more than could be

evidence 1 showed that the ':\u25a0 bad â¢ bill j had
been received unwillingly,' by George
Rohrs, the father, of the defendant,: who
kept a grocery at 1701 Jones ' street.- It
was V proved, also that ; George *Rohrs,
the father, of : the accused, gave thebad
Jjlir; to "< a.' brewery.; wagon -driver,;/ that
the driver returned It. as -bad,, but that
Rohrs, the father, gave i~ It Vto Rohra,

Point "Raised That Appropri

. Mayor Schmltz yesterday transmitted
a communication to the Board of Super
visors relative to the point raised by
Herbert Law in a communication filed
with the Mayor that the money to be
provided for the acquisition of the
Geary-street; railroad by the city Is in
adequate to build a. first-class _s_yate'mf'
The Mayor says he has submitted thÂ«
matter" to' the City Engineer" for a re
port to ascertain .If additional appro
priations will be necessary. The Mayor's
letter follows: " " v
iÂ». -i \u25a0 . \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 â¢ Â» ,
Tbo appropriation of 1350.0C0 ta about one
half of. the enslneers" estimate of. the amount
necessary , for the completion : and equipment
of, the road. ' - \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0<\u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 .
I - have received from Herbert E. Law of
this city, under datÂ«> of June 3. 1906. a com
munication (copy of which I herewith * send
to your honorable body) wherein he expresses
the sentiment which should undoubtedly ao
tuata us all. "that whatever the city does In
th!:i connection should be done right. It the>
city la to build, equip and operate an electric
road on Geary street It is but common busl
ne^s ~ prudence to employ nono but flrst-cUsa
construction and operation. So. good citizen
on either - sido wants to see ' the experiment
fail. The luccesa will depend upon.*' the char
acter of . construction equipment and opera*
tion." but - doubts whether $687,535 is suf
ficient to insure tirst-class construction, equip
ment and operation, claiming that responsible,
engineers - have estimated thÂ» cost of similar
construction for 'two and a half miles" on
Satter street at over a million dollars, whlls
for four and a seventh miles on Geary street
the estimate, ls only two- thirds of a> million.
Of course thi city should have the best
construction' possible In this new experiment;
which* may be not only a- first but a final test
of the desirability and advantage of municipal
ownership ' â¢
* I propose to submit to the> C.ty Engineer '
Mr. . Law's letter, with certain queries arising .'
therefrom and framed thereon.' and If it should
appear, \u25a0 as Is claimed. â¢ that the present esti
mate is based upon < the use of the existing
old and dilapidated- rails and cable ondult :â¢
yokes and upon a makeshift road from Kearny â¢
street to Central' avenue upon, which standard
size cars cannot pass one another, and which
will not - sustain the weight of such cars as
are now operated on tha other - electric lines
ot the city. I shall probably advocate to your
honorable board such Changs in -the estimates
as will make tha first municipal street rail
way of . San Francisco at least the equal If '
not the superior in construction, efficiency and'
equipment of any road in San Francisco, even
at the ' risk of requiring additional appropria
tions for the purpose. X would not wish a .
ramshackle makeshift road constructed an<t
equipped* as a monument ot municipal owner
ship during my administration, nor would I
wish on the other ' hand, the construction of
the road to be commenced on a standard of. '
excellence and solidity and have It unjustly
charged - against- my administration that <thÂ»
work was unnecessarily and Improvldently
costing more ~ than the original appropriation
contemplated.

TAX RATE IS 'ADOPTED
Onliiiance as Finally Passed
Fixes City's Levy, for 1905
â¢â¢; at $1.1 d on Every $100
Assessor Dodge yesterday turned the)
assessment roll for 1905 over -to thÂ«
Board of Supervisors. The roll aggre
gates the sum of $524,433,332. but will
probably >be somewhat reduced after
Jt hassj>een revised and? finally adopted
by the *Board of Kqualization on July
17. .1905. The grains and losses in last
year's roll are as follows:
-Roll of 1904 $302.802.4X>
Less on State banks ....$1,772,793
Loss on national banks... 700, 000
Exempted by law (as
sessments under 91C0).. 2.153,5.tS

Roll remaining 54!>9,2nÂ«.11T

Gain on personal property .4,270.143
Total roll 55W.433.382
INCREASE I>* ROLL.
Accompanying the roll was Dodars'*
report, as -follows:
The assessment of this year shows an In
crease of $21,540,323 over that of last yeat
and an Increase, of $172,000,000 over the as
sessment of,, the- city when I assumed the>
office of Assessor, seven years ago. \u25a0 During:
the seven years preceding my Incumbency thÂ«
increase ' of the roll . was but $6,000,000.' as
against $172.000,CC0 s!nce that time. A very
large part ' of " this great Increase Is dot " tÂ»
the assessment \u25a0 of property which had been
either overlooked or undervalued. ~"
The rollnow has reached $524,433,382. This
Increased roll allows a low tax rate to b*
fixed. With a tax rate this year practically
the same as last, year the city has. owinjr
to this increased roll, over $150,000 more than
last year available for public improvements.
With a tax rate this, year much less than
that preceding my tertn the city has had.
through all such additions to the roll, 'orer
nne and a half millions added to its yearly
Income. The effect has been to enable your
honorable board to adopt a- budget which pro
vides liberally for all departments of our city
government and further has enabled you to
expend large amounts annually for public Im
provements, and In addition, to provide ?â¢ In
terest and sinking funda * for puMlc improve
ment bondÂ»â all this has been . done without
any Increase in the tax rate. In fact, the city
rate is now $1 16 per hundred, as against
$1 31- la ISM. in which latter year few Im
provement* ware made.
Were our exnen?ea now- no greater than
they were in ISUO-1900 and were public im
provements limited to what- was then expend
ed and public Improvement bonds not to bÂ»
bow provided for the tax rate on the present
large assessment roll would " be but 91 . c^nts
per hnndred instead of fl IG as.it is: or. had
the roll not ' be^n Increased, as It has been,
the tax rate would , now have to-be^sl 6S
per hundred. Instead of $t 18. Iff order to pro
vide . for the permanent Improvements wÂ« are
now seevrfn".
In addition â¢ to. assessing property. this ofn>Â«
has collected In the nast ninety days $636,835
as taxes on personal croperty and has .col
lected In r>f>'l t?**3 for the benefit of .. th<Â»
school fund SlffUfN. . \u0084
TAX LEVY. FOR. CITY.
The ordinance flxinff the city's tax
levy for the fiscal year euding June 30,
1006, at $1.1*>4 on every $100, based on
ans estimated assessed valuation, of
$510,000,000, v.-as nnally passed by the
Board of Supervisors. The State tax
rate, which will be adopted in Septem
ber/ will approximate 50 cents. -...._.
The" assessment wlirin~all likelihood
be reduced 'somewhat when it has been
revised by the Board of Supervisors,

The Hollda>B.
Yesterday was a partial holiday throughout
Cc United 6ta.tes. The Chl.caigo and San
Francisco exchange* were generally dosed, but
the NÂ»w York Stock and Cotton exchanges
*rexe cpen. This expl&lns the Irregularity In
Quotation* to-day.
A Jump In Cotton.
ThÂ« New York wires of a T. Hotton tt
Co. yesterday said of cotton: ' . :
To-day" â¢ Government report on cotton coa
r.r:r.Â» Miss Giles" estimate of condition. It
â¢will take the, very best kind of weather ta
bring a crop of 10.250.0C0 bales. There- will bÂ«
Co surplus. It tneaas a great big bull market
m \u25a0 cotton.'
Tfceo PricÂ« tjri: "The Government report,
fcrsun-.ir^. as is very unlikely, that the same
xa.vorable. conditions exist afterward a a ob
tained last year, dees not Indicate a crop of
xnucs over 10,000,000 b&lee. I believe cotton
will Immediately so to 120 a pound."
T. A. Molntyre & Co. say: "SomÂ« of the
t'.g longs wto wer* liquidating throughout
Saturday's seeslon have been selling as much
$j voeslbie through various broker* since the
oper.lcg. Tne largest Wall-street Interests and
(southern private wire house* and New Orleans

their support baÂ» bÂ«ea preventing the market

The Lumber Trade.
Paelfie Coast Wood and Iron for July Â»ays:
"The condition of the general lumber tnar
fceu is xsor* encouraging t&an . for some
fc&cstha. Every Indication points toward a
fc'-oft remunerative season, ahead, and the lum
ber manufacturers. Jobbers and retailers feel
that the stringent time* have passed. Red
Â«ood has not been advanced since thÂ« first of
the raocth. although, current price* are ex
ceptionally strongly held. Demand 1* good and
crozilces to bÂ« even (reater during the cexn
l: s ttpti*Ti. Building ha* gone, on moet am-
Jutiously and thÂ« architects feel that the end
/Is not yet. Contract* arÂ» being madÂ»- for

"Pln# from th* Pacific Northwest ha* **Â©a
' ha appreciable advance, which Is only a fore
ru-.icr of what ie to come later on in the
SÂ«ar. Manufacturer* ar* tired Â©f running at
a loss cr coming off even, and the recent ad
vance for pine and fir is most welcome to
them, as to tht retailer*. The demand Is ex
cellent and a probabl* advance Is not far off
' "in the futur*. Th* dealer* and jobbers are
holding their quotations as near as possible
to tfce list, and evidences are at hand to war
rant the assertion that another fortnight will
t< r another welcome advance all along the line.
â¢'Eedwood ehl&sle* ar* holding tnelr own.
Sales are heavy evea at tie advanced prices
*nd the general movement 1* eatlsfaetory to
those engaged In their manufacture. ThÂ«
Eastern movement &a* been active, but a far
larger range of local Padflo Coast orders 1*
, being noticed with the passing of each month.
"Red cedar eMsgle* are still In good call,
\u25a0with price* g. little better and orders mere
j-kntiful. Some of tae cedar mill* have closed
down for a time, but will commence operations
anew before long. The Eastern and Middle
Western demand 1* good, with current prices
well sustained.
"Sugar and California white pine are in th*

txceilf-nt. prices strong asd the future- outlook
znost encouraging.
"Epruce and general box stuff have not
changed e.n& the Indication* do not" point to
i ;. great alteration In tho few months to
come. | The demand for season fruit boxes- Is
cot as good as laet year, for the cro? xrill
Â« t.rabably he -smaller, although crop prices will
dp higher. Â» The latter condition will probably
â affect the price of boxes all over the coast,"

Late mall advices from New York *ay:V- '.;
\ DRIED FRUITSâ There is a better tone to
the market for future California fruits based
p en an increasing demand from Jobbers In this
eection, coupled with the strong tenor of ad
" vices from the coast. While the demand is
>. very much better than It vu a week ago.
there 5s nothing of a speculative character
Ebeut It. Buyers can be Induced to contract
for orjy what they believe their early fall
uatde will require. -The prospect of a heavy
ti*>p of Apricots and a full one of Peaches In
clines buyers to look for concessions from
liKfcnt quoted prices as the season advance*.
â¢rhllc sellers of the latter, at least, realizing
yihat the new crop will come on a bare ma-
V;:t. not only resist efforts of buyers to 6ecure
hsQpUea on a lower basis than the opening
quotations, but" are trying to get more money
. lor early shipments. Notwithstanding the cer
tainty of a short crop and a scarcity of email
â¢ eizes, there is no disposition to speculate In
Prunes. More goods are celling for future da
livery, but only on orders for one or .two
cars at a time. The- general coast market is
en a 3c f. o. b. bag basis, bat some sellers
ere still willing to book orders for Santa.

eubject to approval of prices when made, was
reported yesterday, but buyers are not easily
Interested.
HOPS â The advices received from the ccast
\u25a0were to the effect that holders of Hops were
t hewing more desire to sell and quoting prices
cf l&c to 20c for medium to prime grades. D<r

reported steady markets, with only email re

Xew York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. July 3.â There was a burst of
animation In the - stock market during the
first hour of trading to-day which suggested
that the much hoped for Investment demand
for etocks had arrived promptly with the dato
for disbursement of July Interest and divi
dends. It Is not Impossible that It was de
signed to Impress this suggestion on the spec
ulative eentiment. The apparently eager de
mand had mostly expended Itself by the end
of the flret hour, and the bulk of the business
for the whole day waa done in that and the
final hour. This strengthened the Impression
that the movement was more due to a contin
uance of the- operations designed to improve
sentiment than the actual public demand for
Investment. Although thÂ« new Interest in
the market proved to be small, it did not
appear that there was any widespread at
tempt on the part of tfie holders to distrib
ute their holdings and take profits. The sub
sidence cf . the buying movement after the
first hour resulted In only a slight Increase
in tho disposition to cell. The later market
was In accordance with the expectation that
the Interval . between, holiday* would prove
dull and uninteresting. The etlff tone remain-
Ing to the money market after last week's
special requirements served as ran admonition
that the funds released by the July disburse
ments were not to come back so promptly
Into thÂ« market.
There is a call for eyndlcate subscriptions to
be met this week to the Western Paclflc bond
Issue. Beyond that Is the call of the Secre
tary of the Treasury of Government deposits
en or before July 15, which will call for more
than $11,000,000 from the national banks. In
London the relaxation of the money market
after the turn of the half-year was more
prompt, as Is usually the case, but the price
of. gold was marked -up in London. . sterling
exchange receded at Paris, thus bringing Into
view again thn question of a further outgo. of
gold from New York. But these developments
did not dash the hopeful spirit of the specu
lative operators In stocks nor discourage* their
continued marking up of prices.
News did not figure In the conspicuous move
ments of the day. But the buying was. re
newed late in the day and prices rushed up
to new high levels. The closing was strong
and only slightly below the best.
Bonds were firm. Total sales (par value).
f3.450.000.
United States bonds were unchanged on
call. ' .

REFUSED TO PAY
LOCAL SLEUTH
Detective Lucas Says Collins
Owes Him for Alleged Es
pionage of 3liss JML'cCurdy
SUES FOR BALANCE
Plaintiff Avers He Has Been
After Money 200 Times
' and Must Kely on Court
George D. Collins Is facing a new charge
that is likely to cause his Chicago wife,
Claiice McCurdy, to put him on the home
grill, even If the incident of his having a
wife and three children when he married
her didn't seem to produce any serious
row In the new family. Detective Lucas
has begun suit against Collins for $698 70,
alleged to be due for keeping an eye on
Clarice McCurdy and her mother, Mrs.
Sarah McCurdy. before Collins made the
first named his wife.
"My business principles are all that
have prevented me from exposing George
D. Collins before," Indignantly exclaimed
Lucas after filing the suit.
. It was brought out through the Lucas
suit . that Collins, although he Intended
to marry Miss McCurdy, mistrusted her
to the extent that he employed detectives
to spy on every movement she made while
not in his company. And for this shadow-
Ing Lucas claims that he has not paid,
even though the work was- done many
months ago- , */ ;
The complaint alleges that George D.
Collins Is Indebted to the Lucas agency
; for men hired to follow the McCurdys
In their movements and Inspect the resi
dence at U23 Clay street, where they
stayed. This surveillance was continued
from March 22 until April 12, Involving
an expense of $798, the bill being re
duced to $698 by Collins* payment of JIOC
before be left for Chicago.
Lucas says he has sought payment for
thope services at least 300 times and that
all he could get from, the attorney beyond
the $100 has been promises. During j the
time that Collins was In the East with
the McCurdys, it Is claimed, the bills he
had left unpaid In San Francisco were
being telegraphed by anxious creditors,
but that Collins was not disturbed by
fhought of the Indebtedness he left be
hind.
"I told Collins to be careful when he
was dining out and visiting theaters with
the McCurdys while he had a wife living
In this city," said Detective Lucas, "and
when he returned from Chicago, Intro
ducing Clarice McCurdy as his wife I told
him that If he was not an Idiot he was
at least a fool, and he replied, 'Lucas, I
think that I am safe in doing as I have." "
-It Is hinted that when the case of Col
lins is called there will be sensational
developments. Involving another man held
In high esteem In the city.
Hints of the so-called crookedness of
the deal between Collins \u25a0 and William
Newman have developed in the last few
weeks, which may give the trial a still
more serious aspect, if those who know
are called upon in the trial of the case
in court. It Is thought that before the
.. evidence has all been taken there will be
testimony other Uian that brought out In
. the bigamy charge against Collins.
Oollln* Anxious for a Stay.
Attorney Meyer filed with Judge
Lawlor yesterday afternoon a certified
copy of the proceedings before the
United States Circuit Court in the
matter of the application of Attorney
George D. Collins for a writ of habeas
corpus for his release on the charge of
bigamy. The object is said to be the
delaying of the trial, which Is set for
to-morrow.

promptly the householder Is quick to
complain about It â but m> one ever

James McNulty Covers Man With Mortar
and "Lays" Him in theWalll
Johnson Objects to Troweling of Caput
and Patrolman Rescues
" 'Twas Just a little mistake, your Hon
or," pleaded James McXulty before Judge
Cabaniss. "His head is square, ye see,'
and I got it mixed in with the rest of me
bricks."
James was errectlng a stone wall on
Market street, near Ninth,, when/ one
William Johnson approached and halting
began to contemplate the structure. Some-
thing about Johnson's appearance irri
tated McNulty. ' ,
"What aro you gaping at, you square
head?" inquired Jim.
"Ay ban looking a tarn fool." retorted
Johnson.
"I'll knock the comers off your block
if you don't move on," bellowed McNulty.
"I tank you bay only yoshing," smiled
Johnson.
James dropped his trowel and the inter
national combat began. By the time
Policeman Driscoll arrived on the scene
Johnson was down and out. Seeing Dris
coll, James tried to assume an air of
Industry. He began to work upon his
wall.
In reaching for a brick he seized the
head of the unconscious Johnson and
rttted it into the wall. Over It he slapped
a pat of mortar and began to lay a row
of bricks upon it.
Driscoll rushed up and pulled . the al
most suffocated Johnson from his place
In the masonry and placed McNulty under
arrest for assault with. a deadly weapon.
"Judge," pleaded McNulty earnestly,
"look at that head of his. Could you
blame any man for mistaking it for a
brick?"
But F. F. Forbes, a witness, declared
that as McNulty ; thrust Johnson's head
into the wall that animated, bit of
masonry protested volubly. .
The Judge' continued the case until after
the Fourth.

'Twas midnight along the Rue de Perry
and all was still save where the distant
tomcat chanted amorously upon the roof.
Policeman Barney Maloney paced through
the gloom. Suddenly the solemn stillness
was broken. A burst of music floated
upon the midnight breeze:
Good-by, my bluebells.
Farewell to youâ o6âoo
It sounded like the shrieks of a couple
of melancholy maniacs in the last throes.
Maloney rushed to where the mournful
strains arose. Gazing at the top casement
of number 42 ht saw Jennie and Mary
with their necks craned far over the slde
wal& The expressions on their faces
were agonized and from their wide open
mouths issued the doleful sounds that
were beginning to make the neighborhood
moan in sympathy.
"Forget It," shouted Maloney.
"On* last fond look
Into your eyes of blue."
The chorus continued.
"For decency's sake cut It out," plead
ed the policeman with tears In his eyes. \
"Mid campfire gleaming
1 "Mid shot and shell,"
Persisted Jennie and Mary.
The patrolman rang for the wagon and
Jennie and Mary were driven to the hall.
As the "rattler l^ proceeded, the melan
choly duet continued:
"I will be dreaming of my own blue bell."
When Jennie \u25a0 and Mary faced Judge
Cabaniss yesterday their vocal organs
were temporarily out of 'commission.
"We was practicing, your Honor," ex
plained Mary.
"Practicing for the Canmakers' picnic,"
explained Mary.
Patrick Pritchard appeared to testify
that the ladles were the most - peaceful
est ladles in the block. "It -must be
Fourth of July every day on Perry street
taen," remarked his Honor. -
"Did you ever rush the growler for
these women?" asked " Prosecuting At
torney John Greely of Pritchard.
"I . did not," replied /.Pat, "but. I have
gone for bread . for them." ; "
*'DoeÂ« bread come in* cans down that
way?" asked Greely.' \u25a0 \u25a0 '
"Sure we're glad to take; it any way It
comes," replied" Pritchard. ,
"I've seen you carrying the growler for.,

liceman Maloney, "and you were so full
that I had to take the can away from

A dog, a cat and a duek â not the

but the granlteware duck that .mur

more 1 commonly- known: as Scotty," Mc-
Pherson, before Judge Cabaniss on a
charge of disturbing : the peace.
Scotty was walking - down Fourth

of the last Caledonian , picnic. The
echoes of the bonny pipes 'still rang in
his ears and he executed a \u25a0 compro
mise* between the Highland fling and
"the Campbells are coming" as : he
tripped lightly along.
Suddenly there loomed . up before
him a lady bearing a duck. It was a
very heavy duck. /..The lady, had .de
ceived the corner grocery man;; by
greasing I the - growler. That Is to 'say
she had rubbed, the bottom of : .the
vessel with suet.
Grease causes beer to settle; with
unnatural rapidity. Consequently the
contents 'of that particular duck con
tained a minimum' of foam and a maxi

much pleased ;at â¢ 8 o'clock - yesterday
morning when two young men entered
his jewelry store at. 1213 .Market street
and said they - wanted: to "\u25a0 buy a fine
suitc ase, .that line of goods being also
carried by him./ He was, quite; spry in
taking; downVthe cases, despite 'his 75
years. He had just opened his shop
when, the men entered and while they
were examining the suit cases he
stooped to unlock his-safe. â¢' "
With, a piece of hose loaded with
shot. one of the robbers, for such, were
the supposed customers, struck the
agedjeweler a cruel blow over the eye.-
Aged -Reuben Mendelsohn may ,; be
termed one of the gamest of septuagen-.
arians. Though' his scalp was. gashed
and the blood gushed into his face, he
â¢ was not ; rendered unconscious, .'and as
he' 1 , struggled' to his feet he yelled
lustily. *
-. Thoi- robbers dashed from the "shop
\u25a0and Policemen D. J. Driscoll and P.. J.
Herllhy,- who were passing^ on - a car,
Jumped off and pursued ttiem. ; They
overtook one of the fugitives on Ninth
street arid Herllhy immediately recog
nized him' as Harry Shea, alias
Williams. The other made his escape.
.Shea was taken back to Mendelsohn's
shop -.and the old man. at once^ recog
nized him as the thug who had struck
him on the head with the loaded hose."
\u25a0 In- tho '< â¢- afternoon Shea's companion,
John McQueeny,| alias John Martin, an
ex-convict, was arrested by Detectives
Braig and Taylor at Mission andfenth
streets and " was at once identified ,^by
Mendelsohn. -He 'is suspected of other
crimes. -The police believe that ;Shea

killed John f Germain, the proprietor,

Throughout.; -.
The Tivoll got all. the tunefulness out
of the tuneful " Amorita" . ; at last night's
revival of . the opera, . but|thc fun. was
largely among the missing. However,
that is 1 not all the Tivoli's fault. \u25a0
Czibulka's opera is much prettier than
it Is funny/ The Tivoleans have attempted
f o supply the : lack, sometimes with much
more earnestness than discretion. For
example. 'The scene of. the opera Is Flor
ence,'ancient Florence. One of the* minor
characters 'is ;Patricio, a "councilman,
played by Charles ' A. Morgan.- As the
only St. .Vitus yet dramatized Mr. Mor
gan' is funny as v..c Lorenzo^-he Is
doubly castâ though one does not quite
know "what It is. all about. In fact, the
fun -lags generally, but of music there is
no jack. "... . . . \u25a0
Chief of last night's features was the
first 'appearance of .the Tivoli's new so
prano-rMiss Rosemary Glosz. ',\u25a0 Miss Glosz
achieved . a distinct success, though evi
dently veryj nervous and suffering froia
some vocal fatigue. It was, however, a
debut j of much promise, j Miss j Glosz j has
a | good, \u25a0'\u25a0; full \ voice.. | freely and cleverly
used.'chic. spirit arid a handsome presence
âa little too much ' presence for the wear
ing of the' trews, 1 say as an Alice Nielsen
wears 'em. ;The part, that of Angelo, the
lover . of . Amorita, is not of the best, and
Miss, Glosz' next role will much better
demonstrate ' her capacities. But her
charming solo in the second act brought
the singer a kindly and hearty salvo, and
after it | Miss Glosz to some extent shook
oft her -nervousness. : There is every
reason to the best from the new
singer.
Barron Berthald has In "Amorita" the
unusual experience of being: cast as the
bad man. ; and enters with comical >' unc
tion Into' the parO His Fra Bombarda
Is. as usual, admirably sung, though
one : would be grateful for a little 1 more
climax. Mr. Berthald's English, too, Is
beginning to sound less home made, and
one actually caught a word or two in
the songs. Perhaps two. Miss Alda
Hemmi's singing of tho Amorita role
Is a pleasure to hear. Miss Hemml is not
Inspiring as an actress, but you get few
such singers In r comic opera. Hers and
Mr. Berthald's duet* was one of the best
things In the J opera, j and was repeatedly
encored. . Grace Palotta as a Florentine
courtier looks particularly fetching, and
with' her , attendant knichts was hand
somely, applauded for her one song.
' ! Schuster \ and \u25a0 Teddy Webb have
chargeof- the comedy, Schuster as the
papa '\u25a0 of Amorita, . with three aspiring
sons-in-law ; on' his hands and: a habit
of giving way 'to second Â» thoughts.
Schuster docs his best for the part, and
that means that at least it 'ls -well sung.
He, does 'not succeed In endangering
ones'.- buttons.'* Nor. does Teddy Webb,
nor does ; he have such opportunity as
one of the would-be sons-in-law.
"Amorita' s" success \u25a0'â¢ oÂ» it is i given \u25a0â¢ at
the - Tivoli is in : Its musical" moments.
Given acting such' as that at the^ Opera
Comlque, ;it _ might achieve also ; the
dramatic .-success. ; It . does not at the
Tivolir But *â¢ oha doubts if even _at the
Opera -.Comlquev much of. the v-operav -opera
could be better sung. One. is' even sure
that' so far' as the choruses : go there
could be no fresher, more spirited en
semble. The ; ogera . goes . for - this' and
next week and will r ' be followed by
"Rob Roy," In which : the favorite-con

George Bischal, an Aus

Death by Joseph Kastelitz
SALOON SCENE OF DEED
Freioht-Handler Slays His
Countryman During an
= Argument Over : Money
George Bischal, an Austrian laborer,
was shot and instantly killed last night
at 9:30 o'clock in tho saloon of J. A.
Jackea. at 410 Fourth street. Joseph
Kastelitz, who did' the shooting, . t was
soon captured in his room at 438 Fifth
street, whither he fled Just after the
deed.
The quarrel that resulted In Bischal' s
death was over rent money due Kas
telitz's sister, at whose house, 31 Zoe
street, Bischal had roomed. He left
there a short time ago, owing, as was
alleged, rent for three months. Kas
telitz said Bischal had steadily refused
to pay the debt.
Last night the man who now lan
guishes In prison charged with murder
met Bischal in Jacksa's s saloon, where
he renewed his demand for the debt
due his sister. In reply Bischal smote
Kastelitz across the face with his open
hand. The angered Kastelitz drew a
revolver and fired four, times at his
assailant. Bischal reeled and fell to
the floor dead. Kastelitz ran from the
saloon and "hid himself In his room,
where he was arrested by Policemen
Quintan and Potter."
\u25a0 There -were several witnesses to the
shooting. These were taken In charge
by. Detective Mattheson and closely
questioned at the Hall of Justice.
Jacksa, who saw the shooting, says
Kastelitz came to the saloon, where
Bischal was drinking,' 'and demanded
three months' rent which he said was
due his sister. Bischal denied the debt
and slapped Kastelitz In the face. The
men^then clinched and scuffled. In. the
mlxup'the fatal shots were fired. Steve
Bluth and Jacob Lawson, whe were
present, corroborate Jacksa's account
of the tragedy.
Kastelitz was. a freight .handler for
the Southern Pacific. He is 2S years of
age. His victim, who was 47 years old,
was a married man. *

Jumping in,to the water/ without

terday afternoon. The two naitfU
left their home at 533 Fell strejj^^"
for a walk down by the cooling:

to Its very edge. While they were
standing there, totally unaware of any
danger, a heavy floating log rolled ia
and swept them both from their feat.
In an instant the mother and daughter
were struggling: In . the cold waters of
the ocean, the undertow rapidly carry
ing them out to sea. ' They screamed
frantically for help.
It was at this moment, that Joseph
McGlynn. hearing the cries of the wom

them struggling with the force of tha
current. In an instant he had kicked
off his shoes and discarded his coat.
It was only a few seconds till he had
reached them. Then began, the fight
to reach the land again. With a
woman on each arm he worked* .for
nearly an hour and finally, nearly ex
hausted, he brought them safe upon
the shore. â¢â¢
When the rescued turned to thank
their rescuer he was gone. It was only
through an acquaintance who saw him

REMARKABLE CURES
BY CUTICURA REMEDIES
"I suffered with eczema on my hands
for two years, but was at last cured
with the Cuticura Remedies. The dis-
ease commenced by small* watery
pimples breaking out on the back of
my hands, 1 which itched, burned, and
pained awful, as if an electric battery
was being held against my body. My
hands would swell until I could hardly
use them. Then they would get dry
and scaly, then break out again and be
the same thing over. I was treated by a
our family physician, but did not get A
\u0084 any better. Then I tried every kind
of .ointment I qyer heard *i, and every !*
home remedy any one recommended.
" I then went to another doctor, who
helped them some, but after, being '
treated by him for three months my _'\u25a0>
hands were not well and the treatment
was so severe it was almost worse than
the disease. I had often seen Cuticura
advertised and concluded to try it. It?*
just took two applications of. Cuticura *
Ointment to take the soreness out of
my hands. I commenced by putting
it on three times a day, then just in
the evening, and when I had used four
boxes of Cuticura Ointment, one cake
Cuticura Soap, and three vials of Cuti-1
cura. Resolvent Pills, my hands were
well, and much softer and smoother
than ever before. Thanks to the Cuti-
cura Remedies. Yours respectfully,
