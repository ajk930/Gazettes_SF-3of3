USES BANK DEPOSITS
IN PRIVATE DEALS.
Three Chicago financial in
stitutions, believed to have
been among the strongest
in the Middle West, have
been wrecked by the op
erations of John R. Walsh,
by whom they were con
trolled. Walsh used the
funds on deposit to further
private enterprises. The
Chicago Clearing - house
banks have guaranteed that
no patrons of the closed
concerns shall lose a dollar.

CHICAGO, Dec. 18. â Three of the
largest financial institutions in the
West, the Chicago National Bank, the
Home Savings Bank and the; Equitable
Trust Coiapanjs,<ali_of tfaÂ«n- controlled
hf John R. Walsh of this city, and In
a great measure owned by him, sus
pended operations to-day. Their af
fairs -will be liquidated as rapidly as
possible and they will go out of busi
ness.
Welsh, who was the president of the
Chicago National Bank and of the
Equitable Trust Company, and all the
other officers and all the directors of
the Chicago National Bank have re
fcigned. National Bank Examiner C. H.
Bo s> worth has succeeded Walsh at the
head of the Chicago National Bank, and
the places of the directors have been
liMed by men appointed by the Chicago
Clearing-house.
Back of the new management stand
the allied banks of Chicago, which have
pledged their resources that every de
positor shall be paid to the last cent,
und that no customer of any one of the
three institutions shall lose anything
by reason of the suspension.
Hat 1 , not this action been taken by
the banks of the city a disastrous panic
most have followed in the" financial
â¢world. As it was the only effect in this
city was the decline on the local Stock
3-:.\chang-e of 2Â»Â£ in the price of Na
tional Biscuit common stock, which has
employed the Equitable Trust as trans
fer agent, and. besides, had dealings
vith the Chicago National Bank, but is
not affected by the failure in the slight
est degree. The closing of the two
banks had the effect, also, of shutting
off all demand on the local exchange
for bank stocks, none of them being
purchased.
BA.VKS' FCXDS LOANED TO WALSH.
The immediate cause .of the collapse
of the institutions controlled by Walsh
is sale to have been the large amount
of money which they have loaned to
various private enterprises of his
notably the Southern Indiana Railway
end the Bedford Quarries Company of
Indiana. Walsh claims that if he could
have had a little more time and been
left untrameled in his -operations he
could have teavcVhis banks and made
ciiormous profits far himself and his
Â£*>.soclates. He bases this statement on
Ins estimate of the value of the bonds
of the Southern Indiana Railroad Com
pany. The Comptroller, the State Audi
tor and the members of the Chicago
Clearing-house Committee place the
value of the bonds at one-half the
valuation of Walsh, and it was their
refusal to accept his valuation that
caused the suspension of the banks.
The liabilities .of the three Institu
tions are estimated in the aggregate at
52d.00U.000. Against this amount the
banks and the trust company have re
sources that, on a conservative esti
mate, are worth $16,000,000. Then there
arc the bonds of the Southern Indiana
Railway Company, estimated by Walsh
as being worth $16,000,000. They are
considered by the Comptroller, the
State Auditor and the Clearing-house
Committee to be worth a little > more
tliau half that, sum. Their value is a
rratter to be determined in the future,
and the presidents of the local banks
admit that, if the estimate of Walsh be
vfound to be correct, the two banks and
ttie trust company will not only pay
all of their debts,, but leave a surplus
besides. The directors of the two banks
and Walsh, -who has turned over all of
liis private property, as well as that
standing In the name of Mrs. Walsh,
have pledged real estate and securities
valued at $5,000,000, and. estimating
the railroad bonds at $8,000,000 more,
there is a total of $29,000,000 assets,
against $26,000,000 liabilities.

This was the striking statement made
by Dr.* Albert rE. Winship, editor, of the
New England rjournal of Education ' of

in . educational . circles throughout" the
country. The J statement was a part jof
his lecture up*6n "Twentieth .Century

"Every is noted for some
particular thing,'; "said he. "The nine

son of a prophetess, as a Yankee' l may
be allowed k guess that the twentieth

little attention as compared with that
given; to his estimate of the leading men
of the country. ,
: Asked after the lecture for an addi

expressed all he could say! in the words
quoted. He. added' that : posterity will
appreciate the real; worth of Booker- T.-

know what his work will have accom

"WASHINGTON, Dee. 18.â The decis
ion by the Court of Claims ftv the case,
of the American Packing Company and
the Russian Packing Company, both
California corporations, versus tho
United States, was to-day affirmed by
the Supreme Court of the United States.
.These cases Involve claims against
the Government based on the fact that
the two "companies had located salmon
packing plants on Afognac Island.
Alaska, previous to the setting aside
of that island in 1392 for the purpose
of fish culture by the Government Tha
Russian company demanded $144,369
and the American company $113,045.
They based their contention on the
fact that* the law of 1834, creating the
civil ; government of Alaska, provided
for the, protection of the rights of per
sons'occupying land at the time, but
the court held that these companies did
not come within the scope of that pro
tection, ' and decided the case against
them. .The .opinion was handed down
by Justice .Brown.

WASHINGTON. Dec IS.â President
lloosevelt and Attorney General Moody
believe they have solved" tbe insurance
problem, according to a statement
made in the House to-duy by Repre
bcntative Butler Ames of Massa
chusetts. Ames admitted that he had
fccen entrusted "with the task of draw
ing up the administration measure and
taid he hoped to have it ready to pre
tcnt lo Congress immediately alter the
recess. (
Ames is drawing up a bill which will
provide that all insurance cota panics
doing business in the District of Co
lumbia, the- territories and insular pos
sessions, must llrst secure a certificate
from Ine Superintendent of Insurance,
who is to he matse &.n official of the
23ure.au of Insurance of the Dcpart
tmut of Commerce and Labor. The in
surance companies, befpre such cÂ«r
lirieate can be issued to them, must
comply with all the requirements of
the superintendent as to tue detailed re
portH. The superintendent is also to
fix upon a fccale of ethics. There is no
Question as to the power of Congress
to legislate for the District of Colum
bia, tne territories and insular posses
sions. By Uiis method troublesome
arguments over Slate's rights will be
done away with.
fihould the insurance companies re
fuse to do business in the District of
Columbia, the territories or insular
possessions, the administration and
Ames believe it will be regarded as a
confession cf dishonesty l^y the public
Under such restrictions insurance com
panies would be as much under Federal
control as though they were directly
placed so by law.
Congressman Landis in the House
to-day advocated a measure along tae
came lines as that proposed by Ames,
landis' bill creates a division of In
euranee in the Department of Com
merce arid Labor and provides for a
superintendent of insurance. It re
quires annual reporu from all life com
panies doing business in' the lerritory
described. "This would." he said, "dis
close any scandalous- perversion of
funds. This would prevent, for in
ctance,; any life insurance corporation
trom holding ninety million dollars'
worth of securities marketed by J. P.
& organ & Co." : , .> :
Landis described the salaries of life
Insurance oScers as the "touch of kin
which znakee the whole country i a
Christinas tree." These salaries,' he
Caid, were in the main dishonest.
Touching on some of the reported
transactions of insurance companies,
he said his bill would "take them out
of the saloon business, the hotel busi
nrfs. the banking business and the
trust business. It would restrict them
to the insurance business. This would
dissolve lAp standing pact which Per
kins has Jrc-3 with himself for so many
years. It will also prevent Cromwell,
the treasurer of one of these corpora
tions, from continuing to be a mem
ber of sixteen different syndicates, all
of which do business with the insur
ance corporation with which he is iden
tified. This will prevent Harriman
from borrowing $27,000,000 to cast into
a struggle for the control of tlÂ»e
Northern Pacific R^ulroad. *
"This is plunder, .Mr. Chairman, pure
and simple." continued Landis. "One
thing^ exceeds the perfidy pf these of
fenders and that is their imprudence.
All but two or three remain in power.
There is not one of them good enough
to wear the stripes of the felon. For
them to remain in office is unspeakable,
bf unspeakable as for the home wreck
er who Â«its complacently in the ruin he
has brought and calmly invites the
American father to return . thanks for
divine favor.
"Patient though the people be. I
â¢want to take away from the deathbed
of the poilcyholdâ¬r the ugly faces of
Harriman, Kuhn. Loeb & Co., the Mc-
Cur-dys, the McCalls, the Perkinses and
Pierpont Morgan, the international

the assignment of committee positions
In" the Senate. The committee of Repub

to determine these assignments made Its
report to-day and its action was ap
proved. Senator , Perkins was a member
of this committee. ':-i-~r
For a new member of the Senate, Flint

peated, promises that this should be done these
;itema have been" continued in the bank, and.
In order, to prevent turther encroachments, it
'was necessary; -for the Comptroller to take
radical action..
\u25a0 The Comptroller's office has '.for some, tinj?
been mdeavorlnz \u25a0 tQ make an examination ;of

with an examination oT < State lnÂ«ltutlon 3 by

from Washington lntttructlr.g Bank Examiner
Boswbrth to bring the mattsr. at once to the
attention of the, clearing-house committee and
left for Chicago on the first train to be on
hand to personally take whatever action waa
necessary. On the arrival of the Comptroller
in Chicago a conference was immediately hÂ«ld.
with the t State authorities and the clearing
house committee, which continued" from 10
o'clock : Sunday morning until 5 o'clock Mon
day morning. In ' addition to the clearinx
'houe e â¢â¢ committee reprei>Â«ntattves of- all the
clearing-house banks were called Into the con
ference at 7 o'clock on Sunday evening.
The' Comptroller feels great credit Is dua
not only to the clearirg-house committee, but
to all the other rtenrinsr-house \u25a0 banks for the
prompt action and broad-minded spirit shown
in meeting; the emergency.
STATEMENT BY CLEARING-HOUSE.
\u25a0 The following statement was issued by
the members of .the clearing-house:
"The Chicago National Bank, the Home Sav
ings Bank and Equitable Trust Company,
which: have been controlled and managed by
John R. Walsh and his associates, have ,con
cluded to wind up: their affairs and quit busi-*
ness in the city of Chicago. After a thorough
and : carerul examination of . their affairs by
the Chicago clearing-house . hanks it is . stated
that all of the depositors oE these institutions
will 'be' paid in full upon demand, the Chicago
clearing-house - banks having pledged them
selves to this 'result., thus, putting ail the re
sources "of the Chicago banks behind the de-
KOaUora -of thes^ three, institutions.
'-\u25a0 The difficulty with the institutions has been
that' their : investments have been made In as
sets connected with the railway and coal en-"
terprisÂ«s -of i John \ R. , .Walsh. . Those . assets
were - not immediately .- available .to meet de
posits and have been taken over 'on. terms

Shortly after noon it was announced

troubles at 'â¢; the door of -the_ Southern In
kdianu Railroad. \u25a0 A "number? of , years ago
he; purchased the . Bedford stone quarries
in * : Indiana. -The* snipping, outlet for the
quarries, waanotso eood-as he desired,
and he, soon became involved in argu
ments with the. Monon "and the Chicago
and Eastern Illinois railroads, declaring
that they, were.; charging : him a rate of
freight ; that was .arbitrarily high. He
practically constructed the Southern In
diana Railroad. the : . line of* which lay
near hist quarries, and ultimately secured
by means of It an outlet which brought
his Quarries'- product to \Terre Haute,
Ind., and there again he came into con

transportation north and south. He de

into Chicago and bent all his energies to
'this end. * -.-.\u25a0;-.
FIGHT PROVES EXPENSIVE.
The tight that ensued continued through
several v years, and it was bitter and ex
pensive^- especially to Walsh. At one
tliae the capitalists in controUof the Chi
jcago and Eastern Illinois bought up all
of . the coal-mines along the line of the
: road Walsh was proposing to build into
Chicago and he was completely shut out
of : all prospect of the profit of hauling
the coal \u25a0; and - was . put In the position of
being 'compelled to transport his own
fuel. He at once bought up an Immense
acreage of coal lands which had not been
developed, and this sank a large sum
that he intended to use in. the construc
tion of his railroad. The proposed : line
from Terre Haute to Chicago has not yet
been built, but Walsh has not lost faith
In his ability to construct It.

sources of the Chicago National Bank has

National Bank have always been. active
in local politics, and the bank has handled
large sums of money for the city, the

Bank was -also a depositary for State
funds. to a large extent.'
STATE FUXDS WITHDRAWN.
At the' last State election a man was
elected State Treasurer who 'was not
friendly to the Chicago . National Bank,
and he promptly withdrew more than
$2,000,000 " which the State had In the in
stitution. Then. Vice President Blount,
who was treasurer of the West Park
Board; went out of office." and it was
generally expected that the funds which
he had secured by virtue of his position
would be withdrawn. These amounted to
$2,500,000. ..The bank was unable to 'count
upon these funds just at the time It
needed them most, and Walsh was com
pelled to' seek assistance In the East. The
failure of his effort* there brought on
the suspension of the bank here. r f

and Brilliant

Clever Support in Great
Production.
Societyâ heaven bless itJâ did not get its
usual fun out of the "society" perform
enco of "The Merchant of Venice" last
eight at the Majestic Sad to say, the
moneys worth of such affairs is mostly
In seeing one's friends make themselves
more or less ridiculous! Generally more!
The amateurs that gave "The Merchant
of Venice" last night for the benefit of
the Doctor's Daughters failed to "make
toed" this way. There was a brave
chanceâ Shakespeare and "The Merchant
of Venice" and Mansfield's Shylock but
three weeks old here. True, there was
fun by the wayâ Mr. Rosborough (Lo
; renzo) lengthily adorning Salassa's
tights, and fervently wooing Mrs. Gerst
tle's Jessica, was funnier than the score.
Bo was Harry E. de Lasaux, the Gra
tiano, In his strenuous and able adoration
cf the Nerissa. Neither did it conduce
to seriousness when the Rialto bridge
bent under Shylock's feeble fist. But the
' performance as a. whole was a remarka
. ble one, remarkable for its smoothness,
remarkable in Its dignity and, above all,
remarkable In Its Shylock, done by Mr.
"Dick" Hotaling.
It -was in the air that Mr. Hotaling
â¢'had ideas" on Shylock. One had heard
that he intended to play him with an
; s.coent- One had heard that he would
aot go to see the other Richard's Jew
lÂ«st he should fall undfcr its suggestion.
That Is why I did not read Mr. Hotal
ing's ideas on his Shylock as he gave
them to Helen Dare. I wagered things
\u25a0with myself whether the Hotaling Shy
lock would wear, besides his accent,
the three hats and red wig of Shakes
peare's day. It is about due. But this
latest Ehylock is not that kind. Mr.
Hotaling's Shylock, Indeed, curiously,
certainly, is most like that of the yid-
player, Ellis T. Glickman. of any
ceen here of recent years. That is.
the Shylock of Mr. Hotaling, of those
seen lately here, is most like the Jew
of Venice as seen by the Jew.
In the gesture, eminently character
istic one gets this. The accent adds.
Then there is the almost hysterical
cjuallty in the emotion, yet again, as one
got from the Yiddish actors, powerfully
characteristic of the Hebrew. They
laugh easily, they cry easily, so this
Jew.
Naturally from Mr. Hotaling there
was a thoroughly intelligent reading
of the lines. He has, however, the fre
quent fault of the amateur of over
accenting the unimportant to the detri
ment of the climax. Not only is this
so in the delivery of the lines, but in
.tiie massing o( ~ his -picture. For ex-
Rrep'e. Not the trial scene, designed as
the hign light of Shylock's perform
ance, but the scene between Shylock,
Antonio and Bassanio. with the speech,
"Hath not a Jew eyes?" was the climax
of Mr. Hotaling's achievement â and
splendid climax. One could hardly im
agine it better done. There was not a
Bhade of its scorn or bitter justice lost.
But Mr. Hotaling failed to reach the
came emotional level In the trial scene.
There were fine moments, many, but
they did not converge to the one in
tense climax. Very interesting, how
ever, here, as throughout, was the de
tail of the performance. After the

PORTIA AND SHTJjOCK. IN THE PRODUCTION OF "THE MERCHANT OF
VENICE" AT THE MAJESTIC THEATER LAST NIGHT. BY SOCIETY'S
THESPIANS IN THE CAUSE OF THE DOCTOR'S , DAUGHTERS' CHARITY.
%-erdict this Shylock is flung to the
ground by the Gratiano, and there
-ringing, kneeling, hears his final fate.
He kisses the robe of Portia at her "the
law awards it"; and there is such
like well-considered and illuminative
business throughout. Remarkable, the
performance can truly be said to be,
dignified, original and admirably in
telligent, lacking only, in fact, the
professional experience to make It per
haps even great. .
The best bit of acting after Mr. Hotal
ing's was the very clever Lancelot Gobbo
of Mr. Alfred McKinnon. quite in the best
low comedy vein. Miss Hilda Gough was
the Portia, one pleasing both to: the eye
and ear. Mrs. Gerstle was an attractive
Jessica, and Miss Atherton sufficient unto
the Nerissa. Mr. J. Allan Dunn contrived
to look very much like Sothern as Bas
sanio. He filled in pleasantly, and Mr.
John I. Housman was a better Antonio
than most. Harry E. de Lasaux was cap
able and spirited as Gratiano. and Emer
son Warfleld as Solanio, William Melan
der as Salarino. Joseph J. Rosborough as
Lorenzo, Charles Williams as Tubal, C.
B. Sloan as Old Gobbo, Sydney H. W.
Ford as Balthasar, and Thomas Miller as
Leonardo filled Jn the cast to advantage.
The applause was handsome, and Fisch

the Joe Tobin box, as aforesaid, contain
ing Mrs. Joe, Mrs. . Gus Taylor, Mrs.
Fred McNear, Joe .Tobin, Lora Barbour
and a flittlnsr of other handsome' men.
Mrs. Joe wore a stunning gown of pale
blue crei>e and lace fashioned as simply
â surplicedâ as a milkmaid's church-going
rig; but it was distinctly Mrs. Joe. With
it she wore .a black picture hat, and â
what think you?â gloves that failed, to
make connection with the , tiny puffed
sleeve. And as evidence that it wasn't
economyâ as you and â¢ I must gloomily
practiceâ Mrs. Taylor, Mrs. McNear and
a lot more swagger women wore them
thus. Happy revelation!
As a' P. I should like to add that
this box had a lot of fun with the house,
aided by their lorgnettes, but the house
quit even.
Occupying the boxes were the William
Cluffs, entertaining > Mr. and Mrs. John
Breuner, Judge and Mrs. Kerrigan; the
M. H. de Youngs, the Maurice Caseys,

that they might pass inspection and enter

of \u25a0 the eye of : which America , has a spe

only I two ways open Ito you. -You I can
either go l by way of-St. Nazaire to' Me

to the precipitation of last nght, which
measured .12 "of an" 1 h'ch. making a total
of \u25a0 1.38 ' for ".this * season. - Tnte Is about
tlve Inches belowi the normal rainfall to
date. The stockmen are especially hope
ful,-the rains -haying the. effect of fresh
eningup the - green feed. Although the
farmers have long desired rain there has
been experienced little actual â¢ difficulty
in the /way: of the, season's operations
throughout the great Sacramento Valley.
The ; f rultmen thus "far *have hot' been
particularly concerned, the '; Season's out
put, having been marketed at good prices.
Nevertheless, the rain is heartily wel
comed, and; it will 'prove a boon not only
to stockmen and farmers, but to the
great electric transmission companies,
whose ; storage plants have been running
short- of water for some time.
STOCKTON, Dec. 18.â Light showers
fell here last night, laying the dust and
freshening the atmosphere. The prospects
for more rain are good and the farmers
are ' once more . feeling bright. Rain
has' been\ badly needed In San Joaquin
County. :The , rainfall to date has been
exceedingly, light for this time of the
year^and fears of a drought have been
entertained. Because of dry weather the
farmers have been keeping guarded hold
upon their purse; strings, and as a result
business has been somewhat tighter thai}
in past seasons.' Since the downpour
of ) last . night, however, business â¢ men
state _ that they : believe trade will pick
up considerably and that the present holi
day week will finish strong. Although the
rainfall has held off. the air has always
bee/i moist, . heavy fogs prevailing, and
the' farmers have been able to do con
siderable plowing. Reports received here
to-day ' from all parts of the county show
that the rain has been general." The rain,
as measured . by the official gauge at the
Stockton State Hospital, showed .12 of an
inch for the storm. .17 for the month and
1.07 for the season, "as against 5.51 for
the season \u25a0or a corresponding date last

SAN LUIS OBISPO, Dec. IS.-When
raindrops commenced to fall last night
the farmers, dairymen and stockmen
throughout the county heaved sighs of
relief, believing that the long drought
was at an end, ;but after a few showery
hours the rain stopped and little benefit
was derived; from the fall. The rain
was more general over the mountains In
the. Salinas Valley and there was quite
a fall at Salinas and vicinity, which will
bring relief.
HOLLISTER, Dec 18.â It rained .25 of
an inch last night at this, place and half
an inch at San Juan. Much benefit will
result to the early feed.
â¢ RED BLUFF, Dec 18.â Rain commenced
falling Hate last night and continued at
intervals to-day. The ; outlook Is for. a
heavy ' downpour, : which is badly needed
by farmers and stockraisers. The 600,000
head of sheep now In this county have
eaten the dry feed bare on the ranges and
but for, the present rain the outlook would
have been gloomy. The precipitation Is
.accompanied by a warm atmosphere,
which will , hurry the young . grass along.
SANTA .CRUZ, Dec 18.â Rain com
menced to fall here last' night shortly
after 6 o'clock ; and continued ' during the
night. X The downpour was heavy.
. BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 18.â A steady,
soaking rain fell 'here to-day, .15 of an
Inch being , registered.
' REDDING, Dec. 18.â The farmers, mln-
ers, merchants and business men of Shas
ta County are jubilant over- the rain
which fell last night and which, to all
appearances, will continue to fall for
some days to come. Durinr the night .33
of an inch of rain fell In Redding, but
throughout the county the precipitation
was greater and great good win result.
The season's rainfall to date la but 3.03
inches, while at even date last year 15. IS
inches had fallen. Feed is coming up
nicely and from all sections of the county
come assuring reports that the storm is
timely.
FRESNO, Dec. IS.â This county was fa
vored with a few hard showers last night,
aggregating .27 of an Inch and bringing the
total for the season up to 1.23 Inches. Tim
ground was beginning to set very hard
and the rain was badly needed. This is
the season for plowing wheat land, and
the work has been delayed owing to the
lack of rain. There is also a scarcity of
feed on some ranges. The rains of some
weeks ago gave the cattle some green
feed, but the grass had begun to dry up
again. This rain will materially relieve
the situation for the present, but more i 3
necessary before the normal conditions
can be reached. The farmers are already
far behind in their plowing and vegeta
tion of all kinds is showing the lack of
water.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 19.â Heavy shower*

"IF MY HUSBAND ONLY
KNEW!" SHE SAID
VISITOR TO EILERS HUSIC COMPANY
MARVELS AT AUTOPIANO AND
TELEPHONES HUSBAND.
And These Two, Both "Crazy" for Music and Bpth
Having Missed a Musical traming, Sit Down to
an "Auto" and in Five Minutes Learn to Play
the Operas and the Melodies They Have Cared
. for AH Their Lives.
These two are only one of any number
of cases in which people have had a per
fect craving for music and yet have
lacked the training to play for them
selves. They did not want a cumber
some attachment, and they did. not want
merely a machine to beat out tunes.
THEY WANTED MUSIC,
And the Autopiano is made to produce
music. It carries no attachments. Press
a lever in one direction and the piano can
be played in the regular way. Press it
bark and a music roll Inside the pi
ano is 'connected with the mechanism,
making It possible for you to play the
niost difficult of compositions.
Then, Just as it Is with a musician, so
It Is with s*ou. The more music you have
In you, the more you can get out of the
Autopiano. The musician obtains his soft
effects and his loud crescendos by the
touch of his finger* upon the keys. Tou
obtain the same -effects by the touch of
your fingers upon a Pet of small levers.
WH.IT THE 'AVTO" MEANS.
If you have not studied mufic you can
not play even the simplest pieces that a
little besrinner can drum out with ease
that is in the regular way. but with the
Autopiano you are on an .equal footing
\u25a0with the greatest players in the world.
Could there be a greater gift imaginable
lUan a first payment down on an Auto
piano? The prices range from J4SS to
fGXJ. according to the Styles and. designs.
THE OTHI2K SIDE OV IT.
White the Autopiano has been doing so
much for those who do not . play, it
has proven a perfect blessing for those
â¢who do play and who have no piano. For
almost every Autopiano that has been
Fold has brought to us as part payment
in exchange some other piano that has
rtood in polished silence in that home for

REFUSE TO GIVE
KEARNEY POWER
â¢ FRESNO, Dec 18.â In a mass meeting
of the members of the California Raisin
Growers' Company to-day In the Barton
Opera-house the growers voted to sus
tain the directors of the growers' com
pany against Its president, M. Theo.
Kearney, who had called the meeting,'de
manding that the directors and the vice
president, M. F. Tarpey, be deposed, and
that he be placed in full' charge 'of \u25a0 the
season's crop of raisins to market' it and
deliver the proceeds to the growers. In
stead of doing asÂ»Kearney had demanded
the growers left the entire situation In
the hands of the directors and amended
the constitution so that the directors may
depose Kearney.
The sit nation in raisin circles has been
serious for several weeks, owing to the
slowness of the Eastern market. Kearney
claimed that he could remedy matters.
He demanded first that the present con
tract between the growers' company , and
the various commercial packers be ab
rogated. This question and the question
of continuing the growers' company were
put to the meeting by W. 8. | Goodfellow
of San Francisco. The growers were al
most unanimous in voting, that the com
pany and the packers' contract be con
tinued. "Do you uphold the directors or
M. Theo. Kearney?" was answered In
favor of the directors.
Kearney, who has about 900 tons .of
raisins, has never delivered them to the
growers' company, in which he was; the
chief executive, although the responsi
bilities of that position had been shoved
off by him on to M. F; Tarpey, the vice
president. Considerable feeling against
Kearney because of his nondellverance of
raisins was evidenced during the meeting.

ST. PETERSBURG. Dec. 18. 7 p-.'m.-
The Workmen's Council, under the very
noses of the police, has succeeded in
printing. 100,000 copies of its . paperi an
nouncing that the Government has de
clared "civil war on the proletariat . and
saying that: the; challenge must be ac
cepted. In : Its appeal to the . people, the
council declares. this is ,the Government's
last fight;, that the throne of -the: Roman
offs is tottering and that another \ blow
will cause it to fall. The council' adds:
"While the Government ! of SL Peters
burg is falling, Its own- regiments are
rising against it -and. at -Riga a republic
has already, been proclaimed. '\u25a0 A few
regiments may still be faithful.*- but the
army as a whole is ' on our side. The
Government wants to fight. IC shall
have it . . \u25a0
"The people are for us. If we are \u25a0 de
feated it will not. be our. last battle. ..We
can .fight on. The Government Is risk
ing everything â Its army; and -finances." :
* "De Wltte cannot play his hypocritical
game any longer.' The Government" has
only made concessions to save itself from
ruin. Now, seeing that Its fall is inevi
table,' it is \u25a0 making a - last despairing : ef
fort to recover/ its power.
"We would -have ; preferred delaying the
decisive, conflict -.until-," better .; prepared,
but reaction t make B "retreat impossible. A
revolutionary conflict cannot be avoided."
APPEALS TO^THE ARMY.
The paper also' contains a direct appeal
to the, army, which is signed "The Pan-
Russian Union of . theTArmy - and Navy."
This appeal ; inveighs against the' tyranny
of the. Government, which, it says, em
ploys the. army not against a foreign foe,
but to shoot 'down its own people. ;It
urges the soldiers and sailors -to rememf
ber their parents,^ their wlvesTarid^ their
children; to take ,a;share Jn'the Vmancl-;
pation of the nation, -to organize secretly,
to take oath not . to shoot " down the peo
ple and to . Join 'in the general "strike
when it shall have been ' proclaimed.
In Bplte of the: fury -of the'revolution
ists, however, considerable is
expressed In Government circles that the
extreme f elements, . in the â¢ present [ temper
of the workmen,; will not dare ; to i call a
general strike and' if they do the chancÃS
are that it will be a failure. ,
The Bourse Gazette < says ; it is rumored
that 550,000,000 In gold has been shipped
abroad to help in supporting Russian se
curities In the foreign markets.

TOKIO. s Dec. IS.â The continued fail
ure of Baron Komura to conclude the
negotiations with' the Chinese Govern
ment at Peking, which were begun after
the close of the Russo-Japanese war, is
an open secret. It Is believed by some
Japanese here .that- the extent of the
concessions to Japan are such as will
fail to Rive satisfaction. For example,
the building: of the Kirin-Changchung
Railway has not been conceded, and the
stationing of railway guards is not to
be "permitted, leaving the Vorlc in the
hands of the police, who will be with
drawn when the period for the with
drawal of .troops expires. -
China's firm attitude Is believed to be
due to combined pressure Indirectly ex
erted by. Russia, France and Germany.
The < outcry -against .the alleged weak
ness of the Cabinet Is Increasing, and
some persons advocate the suspension
of the Pekingr negotiations.
'â¢; The kindness of the Emperor of Ger
many to former Japanese prisoners of
war on their way home is appreciated,
but the Japanese appear to be distrust
fulfof his style of diplomacy.
The leading newspapers are express
ing indignation . over the attitude of
China. The JIJI . advocates the sus
pension of the negotiations at Peking.
The Nichl Nichl says that should China
continue obdurate such measures :as
may -be * necessary /should be taken, to
"insure to Japan her. rightful acquisi
tions." . ' . '

In their arrest last Saturday afternoon
on Marked street. , . '\u25a0 . ;
Their, stock-in-trade cpnsisted of
miniature Jmitations of various ani

attention of passing pedestrians was
to wind up the motive power of their
wares and start them traveling over

naturally shun if they were really alive
and full grown were readily bought by
women and girl?, who never flinched
when the menagerie rushed toward
them. It was mice that created the
sensation.
Having wound up the driving ma
chinery of about half a dozen papier
mache fac similes of the common do
mestic mouse, Messrs. Kagle and Saf
ford launched the lot simultaneously,
and they scooted off in as many direc
tions. In an instant the air was rent
with shrill screams of affright, and
women and girls tucked up their skirts
and either ran away or sank swooning.
When Patrolmen Driscoll and Wins
low had elbowed their way to the cen
ter of disturbance they found gallant
men endeavoring to quell the alarm by
trampling upon its cause, but the mice,
being unprovided with steering gear,
scurried in such a spasmodic manner
as to baffle all except the most agile
pursuers. Nor wore the majority of
them ground to earth until their inter
nal mechanism had ceased to work.
"Malicious mischief" was the charge
booked against Mr. Kagle and Mr. Saf
ford, but Judge Fritz questioned its
accuracy, and suggested that it be
amended to "disturbance} of the peace."
"For it seems to me." opined his
Honor, "that ignorance instead of malice
on the part of the defendants led to the
distressing scene which has just been de
scribed by the complaining officers. In
deed, it is doubtful that human malice
could attain a depth of depravity . that
would unleash a herd of life-like imita
tions of mice amia a bevy of unsuspect

The amended co'mplaint' will be'- heard

Mrs. Laura Harris, who eloped from
Ukiah about a month ago with Robert
Pankie, a negro barber, was arrested
with her paramour in a Post-street
lodging-house, and Judge Fritz will
sentence both of them for vagrancy to
day.
The woman was followed by her hus
band, a horticulturist, and given into
custody, her dusky companion escap
ing, and in court she, then denied un
due intimacy with the negro and said
she was going to Sacramento to engage
in domestic service. She was liberated,
and Patrolmen Prohl and Brady,\armed
with a warrant for the colored man,
kept sharp lookout, for him until they
succeeded in cornering him last Satur
day night..: The" woman, abandoned her
three young children when .she eloped.
Michael Buckley, an ex-pollceman,
was given six months by Judge Mogan
for having. brutally abused his family,
residing at 1111 Bryant street.
Pliny Barnes, ' a ' well-dressed young
negro arrested for vagrancy, ascribed his
habitual idleness to the decadence of
cake-walking as an Ethiopian pastime.
In the days when cake-walking flour
ished, Mr. Barnes he was such
an adept in the art that his services
were in constant demand and he made

the matter to a special committee .with

will probably make several changes
and alterations. " , .
Supervisor d'Ancona wanted the
board to instruct the committee to
make three distinct alterations. in the
franchise. He thought It was proper
that the new railroad company be com
pelled to place underground feed wires
at stated points, to be. left to the dis
cretion of the city officials,, and laid
Fpecial stress-on this point. . .
He also argued that the rolling stock
and possessions of the . company be
turned over to the city at the expira
tion of the franchise, and that the com
pany be compelled to pay to the city, a
certain percentage ,of its receipts, to
be decided up.on later. He concluded
by saying- it was- in his opinion neces
sary for the Street Committee to re
draft the bill.
. ARGUMENTS FOLLOW.
This speech resulted in other argu
ments. The matter was discussed at
length before finally going ,to a vote.
It was at last decided to submit the
matter to the Street Committee, which

SPRING VALLEY'S
COST FIGURED
John Henry Dockweller, civil engineer
and expert . for the' city and j county of
San Francisco in its 'defense against the
suit .brought by, the Spring Valley .Water
Works, conpleted . his testimony yester
day before United States Commissioner.
Heacock, and an adjournment was taken
until Wednesday morning at 10 â¢ o'clock.
Among many maps presented , in evi
dence yesterday by Engineer Dockweiler
was one 'showing the location and con
tour of the water; levels in the wells of
the Pleasanton district. This shows that
the underground f flow ; at Pleasanton lls
only twenty-two feet^below the level of
the agricultural lands on the surface and
that the underground water of the whole
district forms one solid body, w From Sep
tember 30 of this year. to December 2 the
water at the upper end sank ; three and ' a
half feet. During ,the i same s period: it
sank one' foot at the lower level. All the
wells , of ' the Livermore valley are in the
same .water : stratum. "Photographs also
were introduced in evidence showing that
the wells nort,h ' of the' Spring Valley
pumps, which "wells were artesian,- in No
vember, 1901, had , been changed in their
nature, hyj the drafts made by the Spring
Valley | Company, so , that in: November
"of this year . the : water level'; stood- seven
feet below J the surface.' : These \ exhibits
were introduced for the purpose of show
ing , that ' the . Spring *: Valley Company was"
drawing " more .water than the total â¢. flow
of these beds; and^ that they were .being
rapidly emptied. ; ' " -
Mr. : Dockweller found- that J the total
cost of the Spring, ; Valley system was
$26,925,133 22. .Of this value $4,044,670.61 >is
to .be â¢ deducted j for; properties not. used
for supplying . water,^so " that the ' total
valuation of the plant Ton" January 1, 1904,
on which the water, rates should be based,
according 'to 5 Engineer Dockweller, > was
$22,880,462 71.' The ;' present value of " the
works : he computes 'at $24,068,390. ;

wanted to marry her then and there,
but the Chinese Bureau officials would
not allow it, because she - had never

been admitted only for the purpose of
the Chinese village. If she married
Lee she would be entitled to remain. In

Lee went on the same steamer to keep

PASTOR SENDS
WORD ON VICE
Dr. Dille Declares Eestaii-

at All Hours of the Night
CRITICISES A CEITIC
Takes to Task a Brother
Clergyman Who Had Com
mented on Pulpit Eemarks
OAKLAND, Dec. 18.â The Rev. E. R.
Dille, pastor' of the First Methodist
Church, has filed with the" Board of: Po :
lice and Fire Commissioners a letter in
which he gives' a bill of' particulars
touching the existence of vice In^Oak
land. Preliminary to his speclnc/lions.
Dr. Dille gives some attention to the
recent address by the Rev. Charles T.
Walkley, rector of St... Paul's Episcopal
Church, who ] characterized Dr. Dille's
pulpit remarks as "yellow preaching."
Dr. Dille replies thus:
I first came to Oakland more } than thirty
two years ago; have - been lor fifteen years
a resident, and for more than twenty years a
taxpayer, and always a sincere friend of our
fair city. I certainly need no lectures on civic
loyalty and public, spirit from gentlemen who.
a few yeara ago. did not know that Oakland
was on the map; and I am quite willing to
allow my record during the years of my resi
dence here to answer the charge that I am
lacking in love and loyalty to Oakland.
By the way. my friend, who deems it his
duty to lecture two of his older brethren about
their duty as- public teachers, speaks' of "the
organized forces of evil which are striking at
every home In' Oakland." and "the crimes
agalnaf children that have filled our peni
tentiaries with prisoners and sent many . girls
to brothels." I suppose that those 'two â¢.state
ments, being couched "- in discreetly general
terms, are not open to the charge . of â¢ being
"yellow preaching." It is only . when the
organized forces of evil are rudely named â¢ and
the crimes against youth impolitely ' specified
that the preaching is "yellow" and In ex
ceedingly bad foiun! -
I have not as yet attacked the city ad
ministration of Oakland; I have not held it
responsible for the crimes here; indeed. I did
not in my sermon mention any . crimes. \u25a0â¢ either
urban or suburban.
Dr. Dille objects to â¢saloons, side
trances, back rooms and slot machines.
He continues: '.' \u25a0
Nearly alii the private-room restaurants in ;
this city have been habitually selling liquor
to patrons after midnight, whereas they are
i required by ordinance to close at .12; and
In some of them there have been shameful
orgies and , Indecencies lat all \u25a0 hours .of the
nightâ things which cannot be publicly de
scribed. 1 transmit herewith specific cises
with the names of Informants. '
In two at least of these private-room res- (
taurants there are rooms connected therewith
with locks upon the doors and beds or couches
In the roomsâ thess rooms for the use of.
patrons of the restaurants. -
' Minors have been \u25a0 permitted to frequent ono
saloon which has a bowling alley connected
with It, and in one Instance boys and girls
drank and became Intoxicated In the place. . j
In a notorious house of ' assignation, euphon
iously called a hotel, liquors' are freely sold,
although the place | is unlicensed; \u25a0 and another
similar place is now in charge of the Sheriff
for an unpaid liquor license, although- the
place is also unlicensed. , \u0084
â¢ The charges are made, and by policemen
themselves, that patrolmen are changed from
one beat to another whenever they are guilty
of pernicious activity. In Interfering with and
molesting certain interests. \u25a0-. '
The clergyman invited the board to
investigate, asserting. It looks like , in
competence or/something worse ..when
such things â¢as he has described . exlsU .
The Rev. Robert ,Whltaker, pastor of
the Twenty-third Avenue Baptist Church,
has postponed his appearance before . the
Police Commissioners until Wednesday
morning, at request pf Mayor Mott,, who
will not return from Santa Barbara" un
til then. ' ' " V

FOR NEW ROAD
Marin Terminal Kailroael
Company Would Lay Bails
in San KafaeFs Main Street
TEUSTEES PETITIONED
Tracks Will Form Branch of
the Proposed Line From
Petaluma to San Francisco
%
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Dec. 18.â William Cat
tell, president of the Marin Terminal
Railroad Company, appeared before the
Board of Town Trustees to-night with a
petition asking for a franchise for the
entire length of Fourth street, the main
business thoroughfare of San Rafael. The
petition asks that the company be allowed
to maintain an electric trolley system
along: this street and asks permission to
lay tracks, erect - poles and string wires
for this purpose. The Trustees laid the
matter over until their next meeting In
order {to allow Town Attorney Hawkins
to look into the laws governing such ap
plications. Attorney Hawkins said It
probably would be necessary for the town
to advertise for bids on the franchise.
"The proposed trolley line along Fourth
street will be a branch of the Marin
Terminal Railroad Company's proposed
electric road from Petaluma : to San
Francisco, with a land terminal at Point
San Pedro. The Trustees will take up the
matter again a-^week from next Thursday.
VICTIMS OF CAItfcOIXISIOX
NOT YET OUT OB* DANGER
Doctors Fear tor Lives of Youns Wolfe
and Doyen, but Fritz and Dr.
Crowley Are Better.
Rudolph Wolfe, the 13-year-old lad who
was seriously injured Sunday night in
the street-car collision at McAllister and
Flllmore streets, is not yet ,out of dan
ger. He was removed to the Children's
Hospital, | where his life is despaired of.
The boy has not yet recovered from the
shock and the best the doctors can say
for him Is that he is holding his own.
Edward Doyen, the upholsterer who
sustained dangerous', lacerations and frac
ures of the feet, legs and ribs. Is at the
Waldeck. His condition is no better and
the surgeons say they may yet have' to
amputate the injured limbs to save the
patient's life. Doyen is In a serious con
dition.
Gustave \ Fritz, the ironworker, was
taken to the St. Francis Hospital, and
of the three badly Injured In the wreck
is j doing the best. . Fritz was not so seri
ously hurt as Doyen and the boy and It
is believed he will recover. His case has
not' developed so favorably, however, that
it can be said he will not eventually lose
a i foot. .
Motorman Horton still adheres . to his
story about the confused women In his
car's path and his statement Is borne out
by some witnesses.
Dr. T. J. Crowley's condition .Is Ira
proved, but 1 he has not fully recovered
from the shock of the accident.

SMALL CONCERNS
UP TO TRICKS
NEW YORK. Dec 18.â With the re- i
sumption of its sessions to-day, the
Armstrong: Insurance investigating
committee practically started on the
cleaning up of its work, preparatory to
formulating- its report to the Legisla
ture. To-day was devoted to the small
er companies, those under examination
being: the Provident Savings, the Em
pire Life, and the Life Association of
America.
With the counsel of the Provident So- \u0084
ciety were taken up several real estate* 1
transactions. There. appeared, accord
ins to Mr. Hughes, to be a marking; up
of the book values of the society's real
1 estate holdings almost annually. Sub
sequently Miles M. Dawson, the com
mittee's expert actuary, was sworn as
a witness and presented compilations
showing that the society by its man
agement lost about $100,000 last year,
which was offset by the marking up of
its real estate holdings.
Stacey Wilson, secretary of the Em
pire Life, formerly the Home Benefit
Society, an assessment company, told
how â¢ his company was run. The com
pany owns no real estate and has
about $12,000 of assets with an out
standing: liability of about $50,000.
This company does business principally
In New York and Pennsylvania, having
been debarred from operation in most
of the other . States. Wilson - said tnÂ»
total receipts of his company for lu.Ol
were $75,335, while the disbursements
were $79,000. Witness- said that hope
of an increased business has been
blasted by the action of many States
In debarring: the company.
The Life Association of America, or
ganized in 1901. was also taken up, and
its president, "Henry T. Townsley. testi
fied. A list of collateral loans was of
fered in evidence, and when Hughes
started to read it Townsley asked if it
was read for the benefit of newspapers.
Hughes tartly replied that It was read
to show that, the company loaned
money on worthless securities. Towns
ley's examination will be resumed to
morrow.

Charges of Fraud Are Made
ill Suit Over Big Tract of
Land in Orange District
LONG PETITION FILED
Federal Court Is Asked to
Take a Hand in Affairs
of. English Capitalists
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec IS.â Charges of
fraud In the management of property
said to be worth more than 55.000,000 and
composing more than 7000 acres of the
most fertile citrus lands and waterways
in Southern California, in Riverside and
San Bernardino counties, form the basis
of a sensational petition filed in the Fed
eral court here to-day.
The action, which asks for the appoint
ment of a. receiver and which was filed
by Matthew Gage and his wife, Jane
Gage, Is directed against the following;:
The Riverside Trust Company, the North
ern Counties Investment Company, the
Riverside Orange Company, Thomas H.
G. Newton, Wilson Crewdson, Joseph
Gurney Fowler, Richard L. Harrison. Ed
*rin "VVaterhouse and W. H. Winter
bothara, all of Great Britain and Ireland.
More than 250 typewritten pages are
used for the petition, which Is said to be
one of the most voluminous legal docu
ments ever filed in the Federal court of
this district. It appears, according to the
petition, that Matthew Gage, owner of
the 7000 acres of land in question, had
expended large sums of money In culti
vating and developing the property, and
being financially unable, after a time, to
care properly for his holdings, on his
own account formed what Is now known
as the Riverside Trust Company, inter
esting English and Irish capital, to take
over the lands and waterways and pro
ceed with the work of development.
In detail the petition recites charges of
insincerity on the part of the defendants.
Gage asks that a receiver be appointed
to take charge of the property until such
time as it can be sold and he is given
his share from the disposal of the hold
ings, which he estimates to be worth
about 52,250,000.
CIIANGK OP VENUE IS DE.VIED
DEFENDANT IN DIVORCE SUIT
Wife Moves That Husband Resided In
Sonoma When the Actloa Was
Commenced.
SANTA ROSA. Dec. 18. â The motion
of J. D. Batchlor for a change of venue
in the suit of his wife for divorce was
the occasion of a warm exchange to
day here between the opposing counsel
and court. Attorney Minot, who had
withdrawn from the defense, was
placed on the stand as a witness for
Mrs. Batchlor, but rather than answer
a question as to whether he had pre
pared papers In the case for Mr. Batch
lor since withdrawing, he took refuge
in thij statement that as counsel he
could not testify. Batchlor, who asserts
that he had been robbed of his home
in Sonoma, claims he is now a resi
dent of San Francisco. The plaintiff
showed that at the time the case was
filed Batchlor -was a registered voter of
Sonoma City, upon which the court de
oied the motion for a change of venue.

Have Seen Twenty-
Five Years of >-
Service.
By a pleasing: coincidence two priests
of San Francisco celebrated their silver
jubilee yesterday. Twenty-five years
ago the Rev. John E. Cottle, now rector
of St. Brigid's Church, and the Rev.
John F. McGinty, now rector of the
Church of tha Holy Cross, were ordained
to the priesthood. Yesterday, riper in
years and human experience, but as ar
dent in faith, they were receiving the
congratulations of their parishioners.
At St. Brigid's the celebration of Fath
er Cottle's Jubilee was largely in the
bands of the children of his parish and
school, an eloquent commentary on the
character of the priest. In the morning
high mass was sung by 350 children of
St. Brigid's school. Father Cottle was
the celebrant and Archbishop Mont
gomery was in the sanctuary with some
thirty other clergymen. In the afternoon
the boys and girls of St. Brigid's school
gave their rector and director an enter
tainment in the hall of the basement
of the big, new church, built largely
through the father's efforts.
Yeserday was a day of delight for the
Rev. Father J. F. McGinty of Holy
Cross .Church. All j day long he received
the congratulations and good wishes of
his host of friends throughout the city
of San Francisco and the State. Tele
grams of good will came from many rec
tors of the world, one of especial cheer
from Archbishop Bruchesl of Montreal,
Canada.
At 10 o'clock in the morning sacred
high mass was celebrated within the
church. Father McGinty was the cele
brant. Rev. H. P. Gallagher the deacon,
Rev. R. Sampson sub-deacon, and Rev.
P. LÂ«. Ryan master of ceremonies.
Haydn's Imperial Mass, with orchestra
accompaniment, was impressively sung.
The church was beautifully decorated
with flowers of every kind and color,
the whole delicately interwoven with
maidenhair fern. A vast audience was
present.
The work of Father McGinty has re
ceived much deserved praise. It has been
due to his energy that the churches of
Holy Cross and Star of the Sea were
erected. â¢

AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION.
AUSTRALIA, including the governments of New South -Wales,
Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and West Australia,
has an area of 3,077,377 square miles, with, a population of
4045>96/. New York with an area of 49,170 square â¢miles, has a
population of 8,000.000. The money per capita in Australia is $9 ii;
While the interior is a desert, the tillable land of the colonies great
ly exceeds that of New York. The population increases slowly, and
since the socialization of the Government^ there is a marked decrease
of private enterprise, which is not made up by public enterprise. The
law requiring the Government to furnish employment at a fixed
wage and to provide labor pensions has seemed to check individual
thrift and effort. â¢ .
At last there is apparent a feeling that the country requires
more people, for defensive as well as developmental purposes. Aware
of this, General Booth, with the vast resources of the Salvation
Army at command, has offered to transfer 5000 families from Lon
don and the overcrowded cities of the British Isles to Australia, for
the colonization of land and for service in the trades and handicrafts.
This wholesale immigration scheme would serve two purposes, both
apparently desirable. It would drain off the distress that exists in
Great Britain due to overcrowding, and would furnish Australia a
stout and desirable addition to the population. The Australian
governments, federal and colonial, however, are entirely under the
socialistic control of the labor party, which in a convention held in
Melbourne, unanimously resolved its "emphatic protest against Gen
eral Booth's scheme or any scheme of immigration until the lands - f
Australia are unlocked to Australians by the placing of a compulsory
land purchase act on the statute book." ''.."â¢
The meaning of this is not exactly clear, though it is sup
posed to be a proposition for the compulsory redistribution of the
land, by its purchase at whatever price the Government chooses to
pay. It is as if the United States, should offer every citizen back
his money paid fjor the public doniain at $1 25 per acre, and pro
ceed to put it in new ownership at that or a less price, or -for noth
ing. If such a policy is adopted in Australia, as it may be, for" the
labor party is in control and can do as it pleases, it is easily fore
seen that in a few years the process may be repeated and there will
be no such thing as certainty and permanency of land tenure.- It is
extremely doubtful whether such a system will invite immigration.
The closing of Australia to immigration is one cause of the
enormous immigration to the United States. It comes here with
out being attracted by am* scheme for the renationalizing of, land.
We have seen in California the facility with which immigrants, by
thrift and economy, acquire land by private purchase. 1 There is no
public and official interference here with- the land tenure .laws,;-ex
cept some restrictions of tenure to citizens, natural or naturalized.
Men buy land with certainty of tenure and with the assurance that
what value their Tabor adds to it goes into the price when they want
to sell. They have the assurance also, that the land' will always
have buyers ready to take it. In New York with a population of
8,000,000 and less than 50,000 square miles x)f land, there is con
tinual change of ownership by private sale, and no complaint is
heard that land cannot be had when the buyer seeks it with money
earned by. his hands in the trades. A writer in the London Econo
mist says that in the Australian colony of Victoria, where there is
no longer public domain that is tillable, there- are plenty of im
proved properties always in the market for buyers.
It is very desirable in the interest* of the United States that
the excessive stream of immigration, turned this -way shall be. di
verted to other parts of the earth, where men have \u25a0opportunities for
independence. The most popular political cry in Australia for a
long time has been "White Australia." Chinese and other Asiatic
labor has been entirely excluded, and white labor has declined to
dependence on the Government for employment at a wage fixed
for itself by use of its political power. Of course Government can
get money to pay wages only by some form of taxation, and the
system of Government employment and Government "ownership has
caused very high taxation. It is to be hoped that the , federated
colonies will finally reach some plan that will effect an increase in
their population, not merely for defensive purposes, but. to increase
their commercial output and international trade exchanges. Their
prosperity will enter into the general wealth of the nations o.f the
Pacific to swell the sea trade of that ocean. The subject is espe-r
daily worth the attention of California, because by reason "of their
winter being our summer, there is a great opportunity for increas
ing our exchange of products. - v :
INCREASE OF FARMERS' WEALTH.
â j - ,
|~-\ROSPERITY of American farmers, as shown by the annual
r"^ report of Secretary Wilson of the Department of Agriculture, 1
f*-V' foots up figures of rapid increase that are almost incredible.
The . Secretary says that dreams of wealth could hardly equal the
statements of products and profits. "Every sunset during the past
five years has registered an increase of $3,400,000 in the value of
the farms of this country." Since the taking of the. last census, for
the year 1899, the value of farm products has increased 36 per cent.
In just the last two years the increase is 8 per cent. The record
breaking aggregate . of wealth production by the farmers . is; now
$6,415,000,000, and that is an increase over, the previous /year of
$256,000,000. During the last sixteen years the exports; of farm
products have amounted to $1,000,000,000 more than. enough to buy
all the' railroads of the country at their commercial valued .: /-^
Certainly it would appear that we have never in our history
had so much cause for an enthusiastic Thanksgiving day as on the
one just past. Not only do the farm products and the value of the
farms show great increase, but there has been a remarkable multi T
plication of small national banks which are the outgrowths of farm
ers' savings. In about five years there have been 1754 of these es
tablished. Just in the last year the increase in â¢ bank # deposits in
farming districts has been astonishing in many sections, rangingfrom
13 to 25 per cent. In the south central States it was 22.8 per cent.
These figures* would be gratifying at any time, but they are
especially so just now when the terrible industrial depression and
lack of employment in England make the contrast of our prosperity
so striking, The best remedy for such depressions is held by : ex
perts to be "back to the land," and certainly we have vvohderfui re
sources in the way of wealth producing land to get back to in case
our need should come to urge that as a remedy for hard times. We
have a good fortune, still better than that, however, for bur farms
are proving so successful it is probable so large <a proportion; of trie
population w ( ill continue to find the land and its- cultivation so at
tractive we shall be able to maintain a balance of plenty produced
to eat and plenty of employment. f The present rural population- is
about 35 per cent, and if the prosperity- goes on at- this rate
the farmers will have produced in the next ten years an amount of
wealth footing up one-half of the national riches' produced I in three
centuries. , BPHBB9SB \u25a0 .

she said to her husband. "I was sitting
in ' this ; very,- room, when, the first -thing
I knew, two persons were pressnt, and
I knew, at . once ".- that they were angels
because they ': had \u25a0 wings, : and kept their
hands folded, and looked as if they, had
consumption, as angels generally look in
pictures by ' the great masters."
iVWere the. angels men or women?", her
husband inquired. ? . â¢, '
i '; ''They '. were \u25a0_ women, of . course. There
are I no men angels except four or five,
and they are : called archangels because
arch means , funny, and funny means
queer," and "naturally It is queer that
there should; be even four* or five men'
angels." V : "

"Of "course .you' do. ' It's so clear that
you couldn't JiQlp seeing, or/ probably you
would.; -Well, lhe : angels were talking,
and: one' of .them said. 'What are you
doing nowadays?' "and the other re
plied, 'Oh : " dear! , I /have been delegated
to' keep a record of the deeds of that
Mrs.. Browne. "and it keeps; me so busy
that sometimes I almost feel that I am
tired.' Then the other one said, 'I used

the job does not almost weary me any

,'Why,, if I , am keeping the record of a
woman's deeds, I just ask one of her
feminine , neighbors if she .will . kindly
keep a of little things . she
notices -about- "that ' woman. , The result
is -more full; and complete details than
I myself could hope to secure.' â¢
\u25a0.: " 'Why, what a perfectly splendid
idea!" the first angel safd. 'I wonder
if I could get. some kind feminine neigh
bor of Mrs "Browne's to do that for me?*
"Well,>naturally I wanted to do some
thing to please an angel, and so I spoke
right up and ; said. " 'Mrs. Browne is a
neighbor of mine, and I will willingly
keep: the record for you, for I have
noticed a great many things about that
woman.", Then the angel thanked me ever
so^sweetly, and. I began to keep the
record. . * '\u25a0\u25a0

AVOID WORKING IN A RUT.
Angela Morgan
:V7>IVE your mind a renewing.. Take It out of the well-worn grooves In
( -j which it frets and tires and droops and give it a chance to gather
V_-* courage, inspiration and power in -fresh -channels of activity.^
Often wher we humans are seized with weariness and indifference:
when we can no longer throw ourselves with energy into our work: when
life grows colorless, hard, unbearable, the reason Is largely that the mind
is deadly tired of .the ruf,s we hayÂ« compelled it to follow so long. It Is
not physical rest we need so much as vigorous mental renewing.
Our heaviness and distress are the protest of the mind against its
monotonous environment; our wretchedness is the call of the mind for re
lease from the routine. We need to get out of the rut.
Most "of us live in a rut. By reason of the necessity that compels the
average human* being to specialize â to put virtually all of his thought into
one occupation until effort becomes mechanical and work a. veritable grind
âthe life of the usual person does only too frequently grow dull and seem
ingly unbearable for lack of mental variety.
It isn't overwork bo Qften as it Is work in one groove that wears people
out before their time.
It Is routine, monotony, that wearies and kills.
To the most enthusiastic, conscientious and determined workers there
come these seasons of heaviness, when effort drags, when life is overcast
and even the will balks and refuses to do its owner's bidding. At such
times, existence seems a frazzled, miserable experience and the entire
' universe has gone off the key. â¢
tWe fondly Imagine it is absolute rest we need; complete relaxation
cessation from all effort. Sometimes this may be the case. Ido not mean
for a moment to minimize the importance of rest for the body. The phy
sical mechanism does sometimes get out of gear and demands a rest for
repairs!.' , '
.However, we often imagine f .t is rest we need when effort Is what we
really require." Not effort along the same old lines, but effort in new
directions of endeavorâ effort that 3tarts the blood circulating in neglected
brain cells that are fairly atrophied through disuse.
Often' a "complete rest" at such a time as this fails utterly of Its pur
pose, for It "gives the morose one time for introspection and indulgence in
morbid imaginings. The chances are that one would return to his occupa
tion from ,, such a rest feeling not one whit better and less like work than
ever. . \u25a0 ' .-.\u25a0-,;;\u25a0"'-\u25a0.
' The most effective way of restoring,. harmony to a brain and, body .out
o f tune unless that body is really In need of repairsâ rls to give the mind
new impulses, fresh "purpose, vigorous ideals, higher than those it had.
before. ,
Indeed, even when, it Is. apparent that the body 13 sick and In n*eed of
repairs. It is amazing bow potent a fresh and kindling purpose is In re
storing physical health and harmony.
I have in mind the experience of a woman I know who, at a time in
life when trouble nearly wrecked mind and body, and when physicians
urged complete cessation of all effort, launched forth upon the most im
portant undertaking of her life. In this she not only made a splendid suc
cess, but wholly averted the physical breakdown her doctors had predicted.
She had given her mind an entirely new order of impulses and ideas.
She had diverted it from- its- old rut of misery. In return her mild, rÂ«Jo!c!ngr
in liberty, in renewed, life, vigor and harmony, reflected health upon her.

If you have fallen upon heavy, dragging days of apathy and wretched
ness- if you are longing for a change in â¢ your landscape, make the right
effort and you will surely see .the transformation you desire.
Get out of the rut. Make\new channels for your mind's activities.

MASONS TAKE
NEW OFFICES
The officers, elected and appointed, who
arc to serve Occidental Lodge, Free and
Accepted Masons, during the current
year, were installed in public in the
Masonic Temple last evening. The event
was witnessed by a large number of per
sons, including wives, lady relatl\'es, and
friends of members. The ceremony was
impressively performed by Byron G.
Mantel, the retiring worshipful master,
as Installing officer, assisted by Past
Master Edward C. Landis as marshal of
ceremonies. The officers who were in
stalled are:
William V: Bryan, worshipful master: James
M Cleaves, eenior warden; Samuel H. Claw
son. Junior warden; Charles L. Haskell, treas
urer: Walter G. Anderson, secretary; George
W. Drew, chaplain; Walter K. Fletcher, eenior

junior steward; George T. Fischer, tyler; C
S. Benedict. F. W. G. Moebus, W. S. Miller,
Charlt-s L. Haskell. B. P. Flint, trustees.
After the proclamation of induction
office,. according to the ancient rites
of the fraternity, there was a presenta
tion on behalf of the lodge by Past Master
Drew of a magnificent jewel to
tion on behalf of the lodge by Colonel
C. H. Murphy of a magnificent jewel to
the outgoing worshipful master, Byron
G. Mantel, In appreciation of his faith
ful service in the last twelve months and
in addition thereto, as a token of fra
ternal regard for the outgoing officer, a
case of fine silver tableware, with the
assertion that this was intended, in
part, as a token of the lodge to Mrs.
Mantel, who for a number of years was
deprived of the company of her husband
â¢while he was at meetings, progressing
from station to station, until he attained
the highest one that it is possible for
one to reach in a blue lodge.
The ceremonies at the temple were en
hanced by appropriate music by the Oc
cidental Quartet. "*~
At the close of the installation, the
new and eld officers, the members and
lady guests went to the Lick House
to partake of Occidental's hospitality in
the form of a banquet in the very taste
fully decorated dining hall. This, to
gether with the instrumental music for
the evening, was provided for by Egbert
J. Benedict, and after the supper there
was, in addition to the musical numbers,
an hour of pleasing events, under the
direction of Philip Hastings. Seville
Mandeville, the child tragedienne, only
eight years old, presented a scene from
"Leah the Forsaken"; Lloyd Spencer,
the well known monologist, entertained
with amusing stories, and Carlisle and
Baker, "the aristocratic coons," favored
with songs and piano selections. Then,
between these numbers, there were solos
by the members of the quartet.
The function from start to finish was
admirably conducted and left the Im
pression on the minds of the ladles, who
never before had attended one of this
character, that Masons are not such a
bad set of fellows after all.
In the Divorce Conrt.
Dec ress of divorce were granted yes
terday to Catherine from Jonathan E.
McClunie for willful neglect; Hannah
A. from Withold Friedman for deser
tion; Victoria A. L. from Charles A.
Rice for willful neglect, and Andrew J.
from Bella Pettigrew for infidelity. The
m irriage of Amelia and August J. San
gulnetti was annulled by Judge Gra

TWENTY-NINTH
GAINS RECORD
Uncle Sam's soldiers at the Presidio
gained a reputation yesterday for being
among the best- shots in the world.
The Twenty-ninth Company of Coast
Artillery shot its target to pieces with
six and ten Inch guns. The Twenty
seventh Company made almost as good
a record by placing every shot within
a few feet of the target, whi^ l - was
three miles away at sea.
Target practice with the large guns
began yesterday morning, and it only
took a few shots to show the superior
.skill of the two companies participat
ing in -the practice. A floating- target,
which Bhowed about ten feet above the
water line and about six feet wide, and
which, from the shore, looked no larger
than a small-sized newspaper, was
completely destroyed by the first few
shots, and other targets taken out to
replace it were hit by nearly every
shot fired by the Twenty-ninth.
The targets were kept moving during
the entire practice by the army tug,
Lieutenant Harris, and for every shot
fired, the speed of the target, the resist
ance by the wind and the time it takes
for the shell to travel the distance, had
to be figured, and the gun so aimed
that tho target and the shell would
reach the spot at the same time.
Those who witnessed^ the practice
yesterday stated that they considered
San Fraucisco- safe from a foreign
enemy so long as the present two com
panies are stationed here, for if they
can throw shots so close to the -small
targets they have been shooting at,
what would they do to a large battle
ship which tried to force its way into
the harbor?
Captain Arthur F. Curtis, Sixty-first
Company of Const Artillery. . will have
to face a trial by general court-martial
on the charge of intoxication. It has
been reported that the captain has been
on several extended sprees -lately, for
the effects of which he was sent to the
General Hospital for treatment. He
was admitted to the hospital on No
vember 30, where he stayed until De
cember 8, the entire time being under
guard. He was then appointed to tem
porary, duty at the Presidio.
Curtis was appointed to West Point
in 1881 and graduated four years later.
He was made first lieutenant in Decem
tftr, 1831, and was appointed to his
present position August 10, 1900.
He will be tried by the court-martial
board now sitting on the case of Cap
tain Rose at the Presidio as soon as
that trial is over. '.:

?â¢ THE SAN-FRANGISCO-iCALI^^TUESDAY, DECEMBER 19, J1905:
GIVES SURPRISE
TO AUDIENCE
Rev. IT. F. Burgess Advances
Opinions That Make Some
Hearers Look With Wonder
TALKS OF SOCIALISTS
Finds Them Disinterested,
Conscientious and Also
a Philanthropic People
An extraordinary paper .was read,yes
terday by the Rev. \u25a0 H. F. Burgess, pas
tor of the Second Congregational Church,
Oakland, before the ': Congregational ; Min
isters'/ Union of San Franciscq, : ;
Social, labor and general'economic^con
ditions were Interwoven" with spiritual
problems and > the ' ministerial \u25a0 audience
listened, some wondering, "others dissent
ing, but a few agreeing: with' Mr. Bur
gess' "advanced" views. :
The . speaker; declared ' that â¢it may be
difficult for. conservative church members
to conceive of the existence of Christians
in any considerable numbers outside the
church and it was this argument which
led on to more pronounced opinions, all
of which were not generally indorsed.
The Rev. William " Rader \u25a0 was | one who
agreed with much " that Mr. Burgess had
to say. In part, the speech follows:
I infer \u25a0 from an article i I read concerning
Joeeph W. Folk that he is not a church mem
ber, but who shall say that such a â¢ man does
not ' belong to the kingdom oÂ£ God? Who
shall say that Abraham Lincoln was not a
Christian? . "
My own father united with the '\u25a0 church on
his death bed. but I did not feel that his sal
vation depended upon that step. - I had long
regarded him as a part ' of God's . kingdom.
He had confessed bis faith In Jesus many times
before his - family and . backed his confessions
by a degree of consistency which put to shame
many prominent church members whom I might
name. - \u25a0 "
Quibbles about rites and ceremonies, these
sectarian shibboleths, seem childish and trivial
to a soul standing on the threshold of God's
kingdom, Inquiring the way of eternal life.
AST IMPORTANT QUESTION.
I believe there are thousands of names writ
ten In the Lamb's book of life which are not
found on any church roll* ' '
This, I feel. Is a ' very Important question
for us as ministers to . determine. . . _:.-
When called upon to attend . a funeral we
are expected to administer comfort from the
word of God. We ask J if. the deceased was
identified 1 with the church. The answer, may
be "No, but he was not opposed to the church.
He believed in such things. - He was a good
man; honest and truthful â his word was at
good ac his bond; generous to a fault; a loyal
friend; a kind husband and father."
Do you banish all hope oy saying, "If he
was not a church member that settles It.' We
have no comfort to bring you ' from the , Bible.
We .have no warrant there for hope ,of his
salvation from eternal punishment"?
There are some who \u25a0 believe â¢ this the only
course in harmony with the .doctrines of the
church. WÂ«> are often '. accused of > going to
the opposite extreme \u25a0 ana preaching a bad
man straight into heaven, especially if, he was
a prominent ' citizen or lert \u25a0 a large estate.
I believe the cafe course in such cases is to
leave it an ' open question as to - whether he
belonged to the kingdom or r.ot. for if he did
we "may claim for him the promises of God's
word, whether he belonged to I any church or
not. - '- \u25a0\u25a0':\u25a0.. - \u25a0 -,- " - ; ;- \u25a0
One thing is always sure â he will be re
warded for his good deeds whether he is pun
ished for his bad ones or not.
My conception of God's kingdom outside the
church Includes those only whose lives | are to
dominated \u25a0 by the . indwelling Christ, whether
consciously or unconsciously, that' their lives
bring forth the fruits of the spiritâ "love.: joy,
peace, long suffering,', gentleness. - ! goodness,
faith, meekness, temperance;, against such
there le no law." . ' -''â¢â¢'â¢'\u25a0.â¢
I So far as the Christians are concerned who
are simply "detached": from t the church some
of .their reasons might be suggested as follows:*
. CHURCH AND LABOR UNION. "'
Lack of active co-operation on the 'part of
the church with the Industrial class in their
struggle* for better conditions. . . '
The church Is thought to look with suspicion
upon labor, unions. Happily this Impression is
being somewhat dispelled ;Dy the ' appointment
of church delegates to labor councils and the
work of such men as Mr. Stelzle, secretary of
the department of labor of the Presbyterian
church. '- \u25a0\u25a0' .-.-â¢â¢' V
I know that \u25a0 unions are apt to be arbitrary
and unreasonable In their demands, \and work
a hardship to many good men. I ' â¢
Strikes sometimes drive \u25a0 Individual strikers
to acts of violence, nevertheless their Influence
i# for good. Even non-union : men say they
are better off because of conditions made by
the unions.
It might be offensive to advocate from the
pulpit t!jiÂ» principle of the. boycott, and yet the
church has long . pronounced a boycott on ' sa
loons, racetracks, prizeflgnts, dance halls, etc.
Why? Because . they are t destructive .of hu
man life and morality. -â¢*'â¢ â¢-
What a strong ally of the laboring man the
church might be! So long as the church: falls
to' make such distinctions In favor jof honest
labor the ; union ' man is apt to . boycott the
church as an ally of his enemies. "Yet he may
be suftering more for the advancement of God's
kingdom than the average . church â¢ member.
In reality the sympathy â¢of s the church is
with the oppressed in their struggle f or. great
er equity. '.â¢-*â¢ \u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0.-: -â¢\u25a0 ' .-'' \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0â¢ ./.\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0' \u25a0â â¢
Another . reason for the \u25a0 "detachment" of
many from the church Is ; found In the ' â¢ al
leged alliance between the church i and \u25a0 the
capitalist class, making It an aristocratic
rather than a democratic Institution. : \u25a0
PREJUDICE IS PRESENT.
The Socialist attacks on the church are to
come extent unjust. On the other hand there
seems to" be a strong prejudice in the church
against Socialists. And yet I know of no more
disinterested, conscientious ' and philanthropic
class of people. \u25a0' ' '* -\u25a0\u25a0': \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0- -.;â¢;â¢
Are not such as these to be regarded as
subjects of the kingdom, 'even though their
names do not appear on any -church rpll? - "
The, only other reason '\u25a0: for , "detachment"
which I shall suggest is the I prevalent â¢ feeling
that the lodge ritual Is \u25a0a ' sufficient substitute
for the church. ' ''\u25a0'â¢ ,3. - -; â¢
A Roman Catholic, I am told, must- renounce
his church' in order to Join a secret eociety.-
Ho must choose between <\u25a0.% two .- alternatives.
This tends â¢to separate ; : the church from the
lodge.'.-"- :â¢- '.""-.".. ?..,; '\u25a0'- : \u25a0$?. ' \u25a0 -.\u25a0\u25a0;\u25a0â¢.: - :\u25a0:.\u25a0-: !
While Protestant churches do ; not prohibit
lodge membership there is, ; in some quarters, a
strong prejudice against it. ,
I believe ; all ' the arguments which can be
used in favor of a trades union can be used in
favor \u25a0of the â¢ church," as , a union method ,pf
conducting : the most i Important \u25a0 business on
carth â that of saving souls and building char

As ' certain advantages are reaped by non
union . men . because of the ; unions, so non-^
union Christians reap \u25a0> many '.-. indirect advan-'
tages from the " church. -\u25a0 .: :
:r If then Christians : outside of the church are'
helped by â¢ it how : much \u25a0: greater * must \u25a0be â¢ the
benefit derived from the church \u25baby those in

Theodore Kytka haa instruments and talents
of such a ' bent that I - believe - be ' could photo
graph a man with a' boll on his neck and make
him look like a hunchback. The exemplars that
have .beenÂ«usÂ«d- by ;Kytkaand the other so
called eSiuerts - during '. the ; last . three months
have been absolutely - dishonest. Kytka was
the : commander of > many of - these men, all of
whom used his exemplars, and he selected only
such: samples of Davis" handwriting- as were
desirable . to his side of ': the \u25a0 ease.*- . His selec
tions were not fair and . Impartial. > v â¢ ". - '
PURPOSE ;OF ENIi ARGEMKNT. '
\u25a0We. will show you that Theodore Kytka en
larged the photographs ; of ., the codicil \u25a0\u25a0. to thÂ«
size of these ezemclars now. on exhibition, for
â¢the /very purpose of making Uhe writing look
as though ilt were \u25a0 shaded and - reinforced. A
line â¢ or tetter written i with a . lead pencil . is
bound to be , smaller : or larger in . one place
than in another. , This . Is because the graphite
does not deposit equally,' owing to, the variation
in pressure made by | the hand that holds ! the
pencil. This is the case in the codicil In : ques
tion . and â¢ when It was : enlareed . to thÂ« size of
these exemplars,'/ It '.'la but natural :â¢. that the
letters should look aa though they had been
shaded, reinforced and even drawn. .'" : " -
\u25a0We will show you beyond the . shadow of a
doubt that . Samuel -Davis Â«wrote; the - codicil.
We will place on the stand one and perhaps
two witnesses who will testify that they : act
ually saw Davis in the act of making- the pa
per. It was his purpose to . make the - codicil
ovÂ«r, and make it In ink and he was ; going
to show it to Daniel Meyer when it was made
in ink. We will further show that' speaking
to Meyer be said: "Daniel,- I have done as you
wished," referring to the legacy for charity,
which Meyer asked him to make, "and when
It is written in. ink I ; will bring It down
and show it to you.".. '' ". \u25a0
\u25a0 Further we will prove that â¢ thÂ« codicil was
written with a short lead pencil; that it was
written slowly and 'that great, pains were
taken In " the making of it; that it was not
written at one sitting and Â» that it consumed
come time to Ret it ' together. We' will prove
that '\u25a0 every stroke \u25a0 was the- habit- of Samuel
Davis; that he was a writer , of , diversities ; of
habit and that he shqwed almost every vari
ety of habit In his penmanship.
CONTESTANTS ATTACKED. " :
This is a contest between the life-long friends
of Samuel Davis and > the â¢' post-mortem ac
quaintances of the deceased. It -is ;a 'contest
of men like Kytka and Bisenschimmel 'on | onÂ«
side . and all the . friends of, Samuel .Davis on
the other. The proponents will . keep . the orig
inal codicil of the deceased in the Jury box
during the entire presentation â¢of ; their \u25a0 case.
They u< will present abundant Â»' witnesses who
knew Eamiiel .Davis' writing;, we .'will bring
them from . every walk ; ?of ; llf e-r-merchants,
lawyers,' bankers and even some of the coun
try class, and they will tell you \u25a0 that it was
Samuel Davis and no other person that penned
this instrument. ..; \u25a0. ; - \u0084 '.'â¢' -\u25a0
We will also present handwriting' experts,
the best in the United States, /men of known
talent and oroblty. who will â¢ demonstrate' to
you that Samuel Davis wrote I <Â»very \u25a0 dollar
mark and letter in. the codicil. We. will also
prove that' instead of ' being found among a
bundle \u25a0 of 'old -: papers, \u25a0as "the " contestants . al
lege, v the;*; codicil among .S the
1 1 vest . documents in ' the possession of | Samuel
Davis; notably with. eleven sheets -of paper in
which he was figuring .'out his. last, account
with Geonre : E. Bates; .; who ; was ;\u25a0 practically
his partner \u25a0in â¢ deals -, involving stocks, 'bonds

Says Woman Obtained Inter
locutory -of Di
voTce by Hiding -' Facts
A. G. Rockell filed an affidavit with
Judge* 5 Hunt yesterday " morhingr in the
suit of Florence" Elliott , vs. ; John 8., El
liott," which: tells a story^ the truth of
which .the court will'determine," of a wife
who obtained an . interlocutory decree of
divorce by * fraud, j induced â¢ her insane
husband : to turn r overhis^ property to her
and >' then r married, r contrary *to law, the
man who had been : her husband's j keeper.
On\the statements of Reckell Judge Hunt
appointed him temporary guardian of the
insane husband ' until * next Friday, when
Florence ; ; Elliott . must \ show \ cause "why
the . interlocutory decree should not be
annulled.. Â« . , . : \u25a0 . .
According to the story of Rockell, as
told in the affidavit,' 'John " B. Elliott,
largest holder of the stock of the Elliott
Hotel Register . Company, became insane
and was sent to a Belmont sanitarium in
August, : 1904. .-' ; His ;; keeper." there" was ,C.
NY; McMahon. ;On June s'\u25a0 of ' this year
Florence Elliott sued for a from
her insane husband,, hiding the fact that
he" was \u25a0 Insane, and the next day he was
brought; to San j Francisco and, the sum
mons served on him. 'He did not make
his appearance on the day set- for the
hearing and ' Judge Hunt granted the In
terlocutory" decree.
\u25a0 Later, iit is alleged, Elliott , signed over
all of the community property ta Florence
Elliott and was sent to lowa to his moth
er, .who 'placed him in an insane asylum.
On- 'August \ 3O Mrs. \ Elliott; married Mc-
Mahon in Portland. Rockell claims that
the property, was . obtained . fraudulently
and that" the' summons' was Invalid at
the time of the ' granting of .the decree,
because it was " served on an insane man.
.' He aiks to be - appointed permanent
guardian, to : have the property returned
and the interlocutory^ decree annulled.
In the meantime a suit for J6OO is pend
ing against Rockell for money | alleged
to be due the Elliott-Hotel Register Com
pany. He was J also arrested on Novem
ber 25 for felony and embezzlement of
$100 from this company. He has not yet
been tried. ' Neither McMahon nor his
new wife will discuss the case. E. D.

BY FRED E. MULHOLLAXD.
Those of the crowd that separated
themselves from all excess change and
placed it on Red Leaf at odds of 1 to'
2 to win the concluding event at Ingle
eide yesterday did not draw a good.' long,
substantial breath for half an hour after
the finish. The mud suited the Keene
mare all right, but six furlongs is a trifle
too short for her ar.d 109 pounds rests
as lightly on her back as a ton of brick
would on a hod carrier's dinner- pail.
23ut for all that the coin was stacked
xxi> on her and in an extended, driving
finish she breasted the tape just a head
in advance of Princess Wheeler. Radtke
rode the winner, while Knapp had the
Us up on Princess. There is considerable
rivalry between the pair of star light
weights and each strove his mightiest
to win.
Cloudy weather may have kept the en
thusiasm down, but it had no apparent
effect on the attendance. Three favorites
were successful. '
Barney Schreiber furnished the favorite
for the maiden filly event in Laura Van.
fane was flat footed when the barrier flew
up. and cut no figure in the race.
Harry Mack's Tavora, nicely ridden by
Knapp, won easily from the outsider,
Red Ruby. Chispa, a 75 to 1 shot, ran
third. A
Dargin, another from the . Schreiber
barn, met with more success in the five
&nd a half furlong selling sprint. The
Bain horse closed a 7 to 5 choice and
efter bolting at the start and looking out
of the running came on and beat the
outsider. Black Art, almost .easily. Sad
Sam, after mapping out the early pace,
finished third.
Warte Nicht took the first mile selling
run, starting favorite, after looking like a
hundred to one chance at the start. The
little chestnut horse collared one after
another of those ahead of him, finally
reaching the wire almost a length before
Hilee. Ray, a heavily backed one, ran
third.
Because she had so much speed, Laura
F M was played down to favoritism in
the betting on the second mile selling
fixture. Lloyd Fountain had orders to
hold this speed in reserve and utilize it
at the finish, and the mare ran third.
Jackfull caught quite a smart play at 6
and 8 to 1, and cleaned up with ludicrous
ease, Rey Dare came rambling along
from the back woods, disposing of the
favorite for place honors.
If Loague had not displayed such te
nacity of purpose in trying to squeeze
through on the rail. Gateway would have
defeated Christine A for the mile and a
sixteenth purse. When he did finally
get through, W. Smith, on the mare, who
had been cutting out the pace, earned
the verdict by a neck with ' his mount.
Byronerdale, the 11 to 10 choice, piloted
by Radtke, found the clip too fast, finish
ing a good third, however. ;.V 'â¢

this monotony with- a run, so that there

most amiable and companionable, are the
greatest of fighters, the title: of dare

attack wild cats' or foxes and ara a veri

with good nature. A club of fanciers was
formed recently In Glasgow â¢ especially to
develop this strain of terrier.

Sails for the.
The French bark Susanna, for the
safety of which underwriters almost had
abandoned hope, yesterday in
good condition at Caleta Buena, after a
long voyage from Port Talbot. She was
Quoted for reinsurance at SO per cent and
local speculators who played her to ar
rive are said to have cleared a handsome
profit.
M. A. Newell, through whom the spec
ulation on the Susanna was conducted,
also received word yesterday of the ar
rival at Mauritius of the British bark
Mooltan, which was Quoted for reinsur
ance at 20 per cent. \u25a0
The Susanna was 131 days going from
Port Talbot to Caleta Buena. The Mool
tan's voyage from Newcastle, Australia,
to the Mauritius occupied 123 days.
Overdue vessels still to be heard from
are quoted for reinsurance as follows:
River Indus, 30 per cent, and Dunfries
shire, 10 per cent.

When Secret Service Aeent Taylor Ques
tioned the Quality of the i%pers whereby Cap
tain Saunders, Jsova. Scottaman, enjoys the
pnrilese* of American citizenship, there
awoke In the breasts of at least three Pacific
Mail skippers an ambition to succeed Saua
ders as commander of the liner Manchuria.
Ukt the historic peach the hope grew and
trew. Captain Brown's friends were telling
their acquaintances in confidence that Brown
was elated for the Manchuria. People who
rajoy the confidence of the City of Panama's
eXipper told how Captain Bandber? was the
logical man for the place. Captain Frazier
of the Aztec also would have been willir.fr to
transfer his bag from the freighter to the
sumptuous Quarters top-elde of the Man
churia. Then came Saunters' refusal to give
Up his papers, followed by Secret Service
Agent Taylor's large draught of water. Then

churia with Saunders In command.
Pacific Mall regulations require the captains
of departing liners to observe certain formal
ities. The last of these is the blowing: of
three rood-by whistles as the vessel rtralght
*ns out on her course. To this ! parting- salute
the tug Arabs replies and R. P. Schwerin has
nothing more to cay about running the ship
vntll she reaches the next cable station.
The Manchuria followed the company rule.
Three blasts of her whistle -were answered
by three shrieks from the Arabs and people
on the wharf said "There she coca."
Saunder&. resplendent in gold lace, his face
sbir.lr.g- with the Jlgtit of victory, glanced
back to the wharf and* at the end thereof
saw EtandiÃK three dejected -looking Captains.
The light in Sacnders' countenance became a
regular illumination. He bowed toward the
woe-weighted trio, reached his band for a
cord above his head end ojxnjed the threat,
of tho Manchuria's siren, which turned loose
a <3iFocr<sar.t but triumphant "Whee."'
â¢Why did he do that?" asked a Pacific Mall
official. ---- -Â» - â¢ . â¢
"That," explained a bystander, "Is the

Verdict of Coroner's Jury. - >
â¢ "I believe , that American ingenuity
will invent some means to do this
work," said -Labor Commissioner Staf
ford yesterday at the inquest held into
the death of little Jimmy Mitchell, the
sealer- who -was burned to death on the
steam schooner Despatch on December
8. > "The time will come when , it will
not be necessary to Imperil the lives
of children in this sort of work and
this will be, done. without hurting the
interests of the merchant marine."
This retort was made- in rebuttal
of the assertion that the work of
scaling; could only be done by very
small boys.
- "The employment, of these boys Is in
direct violation of. the child labor law
and the law forbidding the employment
of children in- places. where their livee
are in danger." continued Commission

the death. of this boy?" -inquired Cor
oner, Leland. .
.."I would not. like to commit myself
on that point,", the. Commissioner re
plied, : "I am not trying to prosecute
anybody or to persecute anybody, but
I want this thing stopped. It must be
stopped. .The child labor laws must be
enforced." . .. - \u25a0y _ ,
"Do you think that the law has been
thoroughly advertised in this city?"
asked Coroner Iceland." '
"It has been better advertised in San
Francisco than in any other ,'part of the
State," replied the Commissioner.
BOYS' NOT ASKED AGE.
; The responsibility of having hired
the boys -was passed up by Engineer
Spencer of tho Despatch. He declared
that \u25a0\u25a0 he put in a requisition for the
boys to ' tÃe owners of the vessel,
George D. Gray & Co. A bookkeeper
in the office telephoned .to Michael
Derby, he declared, and Derby hired
the. boys. ' \u25a0 \u25a0
"Did any one on the ship ask the boys
how old they were?" asked Coroner Le
land.
"I do not think so," replied Spencer.
"How is it that, those boys were
made to clean oil tanks?" asked Cor
oner Leland. .-.â¢ rix-^-^
"The boys, were there to do anything
that ' I ordered them to do," replied.
Spenper. \u0084 i ,
"Did one of the boys ask you- for an
electric light \\ to do this work by?"
asked Coroner' Leland.
. The witness was visibly embarrassed
by the. question, but declared that he
could not remember any such incident.
He contradicted the statement" "made by
Inspector Dolan on ; Saturday, that the
gas in the fire room was so strong that
he had to rush out 'of the place when
he was there on his tour of inspection.
Coroner Leland had a hard time stop
ping an exchange, of opinions on this
subject. . .
rLANK DIDN'T. HIT GAUGE.
James Lamont, a shipwright em
ployed on the. Despatch on the day "of
the fire, threw cold water, on the theory
advanced by the ship's engineer as to
the cause of the disaster. The theory
suggested was that a plank, had fallen
across the" gauge of the oil heating
tank. Lamont was handling the plank
in question at the time and declares
that it did not touch the gauge. \u25a0
The... jury, then rendered _ Its verdict,
holding the employer^ responsible for the
lad's death. , \u25a0'â¢\u25a0\u25a0 â¢" " -
Attorneys "Stephen .V. and Fsanfc A.
Costellb were" present at the inquest,
representing the father- of ;t he deai
boy. It is probable that a suit for dam
ages will be brought. â¢ . ;" 1 1".
CAPTAIN , WEBER TESTIFIES.
Admits ' to ' Inspectors That He ; Knows
No ' Regulations.
. United States Local Inspector Eblles
and Bulger spent yesterday afternoon
in investigating the cause of the dis
aster." Captain 'Henry "VVeberr s master
of the Despatch, astonished ; all -\ his
hearers by the depth of his igriorance
as to the * regulations governing the
carriage of coal oil on passenger ves
sels. In .reply to a question by Cap
tain Bolles, -Weber said that- he "\u25a0* was
not aware \u25a0 that no ojl could bo carried
in ".ship's';- stores unless .it would
stand a fire test of 303 degrees Fahren
heit. He denied that any one had ever
reported to him. that the oil tankslwere
leaking, --but Chief Engineer Spencer
said -that : he was .under the impression
that Captain Weber knew all about
it.- The tanks . were leaking at the
rivets all; the, tirno^ and though Spencer
had informed the; supervising 'engineer
of that fact the vessel was allowed to
make three trips. In that condition:
Robert McLay, assistant ; engineer,
said that he always used an electric
light around .the .tanks, because ' he
feared to use an: open light on account
of the 'strong odor, of oil gas. It was
the custom 'he said .on board -the Des
patch to pump back : into the tanks
whatever oil leaked out."
: The investigation will be concluded
to-day. j \' :\u25a0'\u25a0..' : \u25a0 .-â¢'-."- i.v-:"

NfHV YORK. Dec. 18.â The news from I
Chicago this morning . practically wiped the |
â¢etock market shite clean and gave a ntw ,
basis to start from. The failure of three
Important basking institutions la Chicago
fame is a total surprise to Wall street, so
â¢ â¢ / s any P revl Â«Â»us development had indi
cate. ,rhe stock market wag thrown into a
"tÂ»Â«n or night and the appearance of the
irarkct at the opening sutncienUy Indicated
-!!Â». determination of alarmed holders to get (
n A, oi stocks at any price. Various
oM ' r Â« to MÂ» ll**>-Â£hare blocks of Amalga
mated Copper came together to an aggregate I
*>f over lu,cou chares, part of them betas sold
at 100 and others simultaneously all the way
down to 83%. This was the extnntt u
i-mple ol the eCEect of the news on the Stock.
f-xchacge. although there were very wide
. ;.<rniass on running *a!es Jn Union Racine, j
i.rpcklyn Rapid Transit. St. Paul ar.d other I
-\u25a0 important stocks at severe losses. In the curb
:- urket United Copper, in which the specula
tion has been v*ry active recently, sold at
I B and then abruptly clumped to 4S. These
>::tastioU8 effects in prices were due in a
.srse measure to the extremely tieavy etop
. â¢â¢-s orders which honeycombed the- market at
* level slightly below Saturday 1 s closing. The
<:der in Â«uch case is to sell stocks at any
PdCM in the event of the market falling to
* given point and the resulting avalanche is
ture to gain speculative force. This being
the case, it was perceived that prompt ratu
fc,s were required to avoid a panic. Enorm
*Â£.*\u25a0 supporting orders werÂ« sent In and the
rfeaaoralized Â«*entlment thus alleviated. There
v as a secondary wave of UQUiOatlun in part
;..ade up or belated orders in the market by
outsiders and in part by those who were
s.We to withhold their selling during tne open
lag period when there was practicailv no de
r^and. The market ebbed and flowed over
. &. Jesser range during the latter part of the
cay. but the principal liquidation seemed to
\u25a0 a^e epest its force and the moct dama&ing
;urt of the losses was recovered. It was
nid*at that the aggravated effect produced
by tlse incident was largely due to the over
extended condition of speculation. Successful
â¢n-eculatora have been reinvesting their profits
ta new purchases of some of the very volatile
c locks, which makes a very insecure market.
during the latter part or last week some
misgivings began to be perceptible already
over the conditions resulting irom some or
the most violent speculation. This added to
Lbs vulnerability ot the market. As to the
\u25a0-:..-. iii consequences ot the Chicago mis
!.Â»;> the prompt measures taken by the Chicago
c.icr:ng-houf<f and the insurance against loss
ot jtfce " depoKtors of the banks gave strong
bopc that the contequecces will be localized
*i.u restricted. There waÂ» nothing to show
that any .New York- interests were affected.
'irif stock market view of the affair was
foottfled more upon the possible effects of the
:a:!uces upon general business confidence and
the standing ot credits. Credits are heavily
tipanded and bank reserves are low and the
! rslstcncy with which the consequences of
:r.-t state of affairs is Ignored, especially the
:.:.h r..:~fc for money, is due to the universal
i r.Sdenc* In the Â«soundne*s of these outstand
...t-" credits. The shock now given to con
:.-.i:ce arouses a dread that nme contraction
: . credits will be forced and the extension
,.: enterprise hampered by a suspicion of the
.- ur.dntss of the business fabric. Money con-*
;.r.ued strong la this market, but eased off
\axmri in the day in fpite of remittances to
i .-Â» A few stocks were marked up in
e /er.sationa.1 way late In the day and prices
peacrally were moving strongly upward at

THE COPPER STOCKS.
BOSTON 1 , pec. IS.â A failure of three Chi
cago banks and the tight money combined to
cause a sharp break, this morning. United
Copper, which has been so active lately, was
the weakest stock, opening at 60 and selling
dotvn to 49. North Butte also showed a great
lack of buying orders. At the low prices, how
ever, good buying appeared and the close was
strong. Copper Range was heavily liquidated
at the opening, but seemed to be in good fle
inand, and the break was limited to two points.

Xtw YorMCotton Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. IS. â The market fluctu
ated irregularly, owing to many conflicting
Influences. ThÂ» National Glnners* Association
report was expected at noon to-day, but was
withheld until to-morrow morning." The mar- :
! lie: mllied somewhat further in the morn
| Ing and at best prices and the leading opera
tions were S points above Saturday's closing.
This strength, however, was clearly forced
and selling of a very-cood character aoijearfed.
which no' only checked the advance, but
later caused a steady decline of 20 and 27
joints from the highest prices. Efforts to
create the impression â¢ that the Glnners' -As
sociation report, showing cotton ginned: to
December 13, which will be out to-nlsht,
would be very bullish, failed to keep the
market up.' According to rumor the . asso
ciation report will show y, 100,000 bales. An
other .report stated that the census bureau
ginning report, which - will' be made public on
Wednesday, would show 0,317,000 bales ginned
up to December 13. . The selling, to-day was
of a much better, character than the* buying.
Advices from President Jordan at Atlanta,
state that he can hardly see where the crop
ginned to December 13 can possibly be 1 , over
Â»,250,000 running bales. This would indicate
a crop of 9.750,000 bales. : .
The Cotton Exchange will be closed Decem

Future Grain and . Provisions.
.' CHICAGO,"' Dec 18.â During the i first hour
of; to-day's session i the ..wheat market was re
markably.^ firm - considering = the â¢ uneasiness -in
financial circles, following .: the ; suspension of
the Walsh banks. The firmness was largely
the result of the bullish character . Of : ..'. the
weekly statistics. World's'. ehipmenta for the
week were nearly ' 4,000,000 . uushels â¢ less than
for ! the r previous week \u25a0 and a large percentase
of the . decrease - was recorded in . the Russian
exports.- In addition, to this the amount: of
lreadâ¬tutts .on ocean- passage â¢ decreased >J 4,^
552,000 buehels for the week. .After opening a
shade lower to" a ehade^hlgher at 87 Tic to.SSe.
the price of the May option was bifl up. ; .to
68% c. i At this point wheat broke badly at
Minneapolis and - St. Loulfl, the decline being
due, it is said, to the bank Bltuatlon in . Chi
cago. \u25a0 Tliera.was heavy selling on orders: from
these two grain centers." 'This .brought out
Iree selling by . local traders. As : prices \ de
clined stop-loss ' orders increased the pressure
and the weakness . became \u25a0 more â¢ pronounced.
An increase of 4,124,000 bushels in \ the ;, visible
supply exerted a bearish influence on the,mar
ket, an increase of only 3,000,000 buehfls hav
ing/been expected. Another factor bringing
on the decline was \u25a0 the large primary ;â¢; ro
ceipts. May declined: to 87V4c, rallied and
closed weak, 'i/.c lower at '87%Â®87%cn \u25a0\u25a0".'\u25a0Â» "
â¢ Increased receipts . end â¢ the weakness of
wheat . had a depressing effect ,\u25a0 on the corn
market. The close was easy. May closed \i to
%c lower at 44Hc
, Several 'prominent commission houses were
active sellers of oats. The market closed at
about the lowest point ot the ; day. MO7
closed %c off at 31?4@32c. - :
Notwithstanding the weakness of grains the
provision market was firm throughout the. day.
At the close May pork was up .7 %c and lard

DEATH SHADOW SOFTENS
FATHER'S HEART.
Banker S. G. Murphy Forgives Daughter He Once Disowned
DISOWNED DAUGHTER WHOSE SERIOUS ILLNESS IN PARIS HAS CAUSED STERN S. G. MURPHY, THE WELL-KNOWN
BANKER OF THIS CITY, TO : RELENT AND FORGIVE HER. HE DENIED HIS DAUGHTER WHEN IN 1002 SHE MAR
RIED THE MAN HE BITTERLY OBJECTED TO. â¢
When, two years ago. Samuel G- Mur
phy, president of the First National
Bank, heard that his daughter Adelaide
bad, in defiance of his wishes, married
John C. Breckinridge, clubman, gilded
youth and heir to mlllionE, he said: "I
had a daughter once; if she is married,
the is dead."
And yet, when laÂ«t Thursday there
came a cable from Paris announcing
that the young woman was 111 unto death,
he made preparations to 'leave immedi
ately for her -bedside.- And yesterday,
â¢when there came a new cable telling that
ehe was better and might live, the stern
man of Inflexible resolutions ' said," . in . a
voice that rasped as if the iron hand of
woe were clutching him at the throat,
"We had a â¢ misunderstanding j once, but
that is all -over now. 1 shall go to her
If ehe needs me." . : '
And thus has the shadow of death, flit
ting by, broken to mercifulness hearts
tense with sense of ' irretrievable griev
ance, reunited a father 'and a daughter,
reunited two families at' feud and ended
a battle that -had raged through two
years over two continents.

inridge before Rev. George C.Eldredge
of j St. John's Presbyterian Church and
was united in wedlock. The young peo
ple had known each other several months.
John C. Breckinridge was of elite stock.
Grandson of millionaire Lloyd Tevis, son
of/:. Mrs. : Frederick Sharon, he was
wealthy, handsome, well connected and
popular. Yet his suit had been opposed
strongly by Banker Murphy, and finally,
it was surreptitiously and'.ln cold de
fiance of the wealthy father that he | took
the daughter to wife. When apprised
of the marriage Murphy said: "I had a
daughter once; now she is dead." : ? v>'
OBJECTIONS A MYSTERY.
What the grounds of Mr. Murphy's ob
jections to the marriage were no one at
thÂ« time, knew, and all the friends of the
young couple ranged themselves for the
children and against the father. The
rooms that the young . people had taken
at the Palace Hotel were fairly embow
ered with flowers sent by friends in token
of esteem and loyalty. And yet, as later
events showed. Murphy seemed to have
been actuated by some mysterious pa-,
rental second , sight, '\u25a0 born of love for his

daughter. . From the first a singular ill
fate : seemed to dog the bridegroom.
The newspapers of that time report
that on the first day 'of the arrival of the
couple at the Palace Hotel the husband
wa3 taken ill. . . On . the third day of their
stay_ her is reported as taking a stroll
along Market' street: against the doctor's
orders. This :; Was/but a premonition. A
few weeks later": the â¢ Breckinrldges left
for Eurooe.' -There the 'mysterious doom
that â¢ seemed I within,: them* followed. On
March 4, 1903, a ;.bare l . eight : months after
the wedding,' their; friends- were horrified
by a telesram; announcing' that ; John C.
Breckinridge, while at .the Hotel d' Albe,
on the Champs"' Elys*ees\ in 'Paris, had

taken from .the house where Collins
claims' he, never stayed overnight. The
defendant maintains 'that the Newman
boys wore- his shirts. ' <;%
There was a procession of witnesses all
day yesterday, some new and some re
called, who took the stand in the State's
behalf in rebuttal of Collins' testimony
and "that of his witnesses. Collins availed
himself of the. privilege of calling three
additional witnesses and with their tes
timony his defense ended, except the re
cital of the argument to the jury.
. RECALLS "BLACK BART."
"Then shirts, collars and cuffs" incident
occurred when E. Larrouy, a laundry
man, was called to the stand by the
prosecution. He said that he always
know Charlotta as Mrs. Collins and then
testified that from, January, 1903, -until
May, 1905, he did the laundry work for
a "Mrs. J. Collins" at 2519 Pierce street.
He further testified, that at times the
laundry bore the initials "J. C. C."
"Did all the laundry bear the initials
G. D. C?" hastily interposed Bytngton,
laying * slight stress on the -middle In
itial ,"D."
'Collins immediately sprang to his feet
with/an objection that the District At
torney was misrepresenting the witness.
Larrouy then perceived that he had made
a mistake \u25a0in the initials, and corrected
himself by ; saying that he. meant ."J. C.
D," then "G. C. C." and finally arriving
at G. D. C. The witness further added
that he was not sure about the middle
initial, but knew there was a G. and a C.
Throughout -the cross-examination he
frequently called the fe a "J," to the
confusion .of the record.
Collins first objected to the testimony
as immaterial and then proceeded with
a .cross-examination, in which. he stated
that no doubt the Newman boys were
wearing his ; shirts, as one -laundry was
taken and delivered while the defendant
was out of the j city. Byington main
tained that the testimony; was material
and quoted the case of the identification
of the highwayman, "Black Bart," by the
laundry mark on his cuff. He contended
that it was circumstantial evidence.
Judge Lennon admitted the testimony,
with the understanding . that it should
be stricken from the record if the pros
ecution; fails to connect: it with the'de
fendant ââ¢ to prove* that he has resided
at the house since his return from Chi
cago. Collins then asked the prosecution
in a stage whisper to â¢ proceed with the
.washing of the, rest of the dirty linen."
CROCKER BUII,1)I.VG TIME BOOK.
An interesting exhibit i was the , time
book at the Crocker building. The figures
kept, by the watchman, W. "W. Meade,
show arrivals and departures of tenants
during the night. An attempt is . being
made by the prosecution to show. that
Cofiins never slept in, his office at. the
building, despite his assertion to the con
trary. A strange thing about the book Is
the fact that every figure relating to: the
hour, of Collins' departure shows the
presence of acid erasures and ink sub
stitutions. The erasures, only affect the
figures folldwinu Collins* name for the
nights about which there is a question.
Meade on the stand strenuously denied
making ;. any 'â¢ erasures. John R. Keef e,
janitor of the ; building, testified that the
janitors reported to' him if any tenant
slept ; In I the : building, . which was against
the rules, and said that no report of Col
lins' so sleeping waa made by them to
him.
Assistant District Attorney R. V. "Whit
ing testified to . the Collins testimony In
Victoria/ B. C, and; substantiated much
of the matter contained in a transcript of
the : Canadian ' court's f record. \u25a0 He said
that Collins on the 1 stand denied the in
dorsement of ; the; marriage certificate,
while here the defendant testified, that he
himself indorsed his own and Charlotta' a
names.
\u25a0In, the cross-examination Collins opened
up ; sharply on : the witness, who replied
tartly: until the defendant adopted a more
courteous tone. Later Detective Thomas
Gibson substantiated in part the testi
mony. of Whiting, and added that Col
lins claimed in : Victoria that . he had not
seen the; marriage .license from the | day
Mulcahey obtained it \u25a0in the License Of
fice until it was shown to him In the trial
at Victoria. .

NO NEW PHONES
FOR SOME TIME
Supervisors Decide to Pass
Home Company's Applica
tion Up to Incoming Board
HOT AEGUMENTS ENSUE
Decision Is Finally Beached
Close Vote of Seven
to Six Against Concern
The petition of the New Home Tele
phone Company for a franchise to do
business In opposition to the present con
cern was turned down by the Board of
Supervisors yesterday \ afternoon, and,
after a hot discussion, the question was
passed up to the new board, which will
assume office on the first, of the year.
The motion was passed by a vote of 7
to, 6 and from first Indications it looked
as If the board would act on the matter
and have done with it before passing out
of; office.
This means practically that the pro
.moters of the concern will have to go
through their same old stunts over again
arid petition the new board for a fran
chise. This is unfortunate for the com
pany, as It has had its petition before the
present board : for the last six months,
but numerous delays interfered till the
maiter finally dragged along with disas
trous results to the company. -^
Supervisor^Brandenstein opened up the
spirited argument by saying it was in his
opinion the duty of the Supervisors to
consider the matter by the entire board
as a committee and thus pass on the
merits. He said the Public Utility Com
mittee had been in session all morning
without being able to arrive at any con
clusion, and suggested that the company
be given the privilege of having the af
fair settled at once and by "the entire
board.
But this did not suit Boxton at all. He
wanted to pass the matter up to the in
coming board, saying there was too much
work connected with it, - and that the
present members could not take care of
the matter in such a short â¢ time. Gal
lagher suggested a special meeting to be
held to-morrow, at which time the board
could consider the matter and settle it
without further delay.
He was followed by Judge North, rep
resenting the company. The Judge said
that if the board refused to give them
a hearing he would take it that the fran
chise of the present company would be
considered conclusive. He said the new
concern was abona fide one and -that its
purpose was known to all the members,
being before the board. for such a length
of time. He said the company had gone
to a great deal of expense and waited a
long time and did not think it just to
have the matter passed up to a new
board, requiring the directors to go
through the same work over again.
The argument by Boxton. Braunhart,
D'Ancona, Gallagher and Eggers con
tinued for -some time, till the matter was
finally brought to a vote. The opinions
of. the silent members were not known,
yet it looked as If the board would take
final action on the matter. But when
the vote was cast it resulted In the de
feat of the measure by. 7 to 6, thus pass
ing It up to the new board.
) Boxton, the champion of the ; measure
that carried, said, "It did not look good
to him," adding that four, other like fran
chises, were before the board and that
they all should receive an equal amount
of attention. His argument was that
the board could not do the measure Jus
tice, and therefore the incoming members
were the ones to settle it. as they would
have ample time at their disposal.

i.MISSTATEMENT ABOUT THE
RECENT 3IoNALLY AV*EDDING
Groom Is Los Aageles â¢ Contractor and
Not ChleaÃo Publisher, as Ap
peared In Account of The Call.
The Call on November 29 published
an account of the wedding of Andrew
M.- McNally to Miss Susan Johnston of
Los Angeles at the Palace Hotel in this
city. s In the account the statement was
made that Mr. McNally was a member
of the Rand-McNally Publishing Com
pany of Chicago.
â¢The Call Is glad to correct the mis
statement to-day. The Mr. McNally
who was married is a contractor of
Pasadena and not the Chicago pub
lisher. The mistake was due to a
similarity in the addresses and initials
of the two men. . A. M. McNally of
Chicago died in California in May, 1904.
