A little boy was lifted upon the shoul
ders of one. of the Texas delegates and
the flag .waved ' by his small hands
brought out much enthusiasm.
Maryland, rushing back to her place
in the delegates seats, grabbed the pole
with her State name upon it and then
placed the pole higher than any other
in thfe line , of march. The cue was
immediately seized wherever possible
by other delegations and â¢ the tramp
around the hall continued, the march
ers finally passing out from the dele
gates' seats in among those occupied
by the , visitors.
After the excitement' had . continued
SCENES OF ENTHUSIASM.
Florida, after a few seconds of wild
yelling, started around the hall, its
men screaming frantically and tossing
high a silken banner Inscribed, "Flor
ida, Safe and Sound."
Indian Territory, New Jersey, Mary
land. Texas, Georgia and many other
States fell in behind. Michigan came
next and her great blue banner, was
borne up the steps of the platform be
hind the chairman's desk, where it
was held high and waved wildly to and
fro.
laughter, few points being lost on his
audience. .
A terrific outburst of cheering fol
lowed Littleton's remark about Judge
Parker:
"If you ask why he has been silent
I answer because he has not attempted
to be the master of his party, but is
content to be Its servant."
All that had happened In the conven
tion up to the time Littleton had con
cluded his address multiplied many
times was almost as nothing compared
to the hurricane that broke out when
he mentioned the name of "Alton B.
Parker," on the part of the delegates.
It was a revelation in politics. Like
one man they sprang up in their chairs
with everything that could be waved
tossed high in the air.
A'shouter.who had started a disturb
ance was escorted from the hall by an
officer.
Senator Carmack concluded his
speech at 10:15.
The r galleries . seized . the opportunity
for a shout and disturbance reigned for
some * time Â¦ ' t while Chairman Clark
pounded with his gavel' for order.
DELMAS NAMES HEARST.
. "Arkansas yields to Tennessee," an
swered the chairman of the delega
tions Senator Carmack of that State
was recognized and at once took the
platform and began speaking, second
ing the nomination of Judge Parker.
Senator Carmack had spoken but a
few, words when "Hurrah for Hearst"
was . hurled at him from the balcony,
the remark- being greeted by cheers
and some hisses. A few other calls of
a like character were made by people
in the , galleries ,but the great ; body . of
the convention disapproved. Â¦ Senator
Carmack's voice did not fill the hall to
the satisfaction of the galleries and he
was, interrupted repeatedly by. cries of
"Louder." It became apparent that
much of the disturbance was .caused
by ' partisan enthusiasm in the galler
ies. ;'â¢Â¦-Â¦ . : -y:;V rr:;..^;,:'"'
"We won't go home until morning,"
played the band, and when the air was
concluded quiet was once more re
stored.
"Arkansas," shouted the clerk.
of the delegation, keeping time with
waving flags.
The Parker picture was carried from
the platform and placed near New
York's position in the hall. It was
soon taken down, but just the Instant it
was lowered the California delegation
displayed a Hearst picture only for an
instant, but it was long enough for
his following among the delegates to
catch sight of it, and a ringing shout
went up. It kindled again the dying
demonstration for Parker. t
about twelve minutes there was a ppr
ceptible abatement and the , band
struck up "America," thousands of
voices Joining in the song. The lull
speedily passed away, for the band
struck up "Dixie" and this was oil on
a fire already fiercely blazing. With
a spasmodic yell the applause started
all over, again. During the noise the
band played and a huge bust picture of
Parker was carried up the center aisle.
Just as lit reached the. platform two
young ladles of St. Louis, dressed ,in
white and carrying mammoth bouquets
of roses and ferns, were assisted to the
presiding officer's table, and the huge
portrait was held for a moment be
tween them, face to the delegates, and
the State banners which had formed
the procession were, held aloft r and
massed around it. Rhythmic shouts of
"Parker, . Packer," "Alton B. Parker,'*
were started and caught up.
At the end of eighteen, minutes the
demonstration began to subside. The
Parker portrait was.then taken" to. the
platform and turned toward the audi
ence. At the. expiration of twenty-two
minutes efforts were made to still the
demonstration. A megaphone about ,the
platform was : begun for "Parker,
Parker," : however, and things ' broke
loose again. The , demonstration lasted
twenty-five .minutes.
. Throughout the enthusiasm ,the Ne
braska delegation. Bryan at its head!

to see what was going on,, but without
rising. :; -..,-,.
When , the demonstration was at its
height Bryan sent a' r message* to somo

BOYS LEAD THE* CHEERING.
, Commandlhgthe highest view of any
one on the' floor: of "the -hall, were five
boys, in the New, York delegation 1 who
.were lifted! on'their fathers'; shoulders,
and from f that 1 height- led 'the cheering

| demanded, but ineffectually.
Disturbances resulting from cries for
| order from various portions of the hall
i exhausted the patience of Chairman
| Clark, and he gave personal directions
to have several persons quieted or put
out. Senator Daniel, however, refused
to be disturbed. He proceeded with the
reading of the platform regardless of.
the fact that not one soul in the hall
j except perhaps the stenographer, who
stood at the steps just beneath him,
heard a word. When it was observed
that he had ceased reading the conven
j tion broke into cheering. Senator Dan-
I !el said:
"I am unanimously instructed by
your committee on platform to move
the previous question on Its adoption,
and I now make that motion."
PLATFORM IS ADOPTED.
It was adopted by a viva voce vote,
two or three delegates voting in the
negative, and they apparently In a
spirit of fun. Chairman Clark then
put the motion to adopt the report, and
a viva voce vote carried it.
Temporary Chairman Williams then
mounted the steps leading up to the
platform, Â» swung his hat around his
head and the delegates, following his
lead, roared their applause again and
again, while the band played "Hail
Columbia."
"The clerk will now call the roll of
States for the nomination of a candi
date for President." shouted the chair
man. A wild cry of delight came from
! the galleries, who seemed to think th*
j whole thipg a show run for their enter
tainment.
"Alabama," shrieked the clerk.
"Alabama yields to the Empire State
of New York," called Delegate Russell
of Alabama, standing In his chair, one
arm grasping the standard of his State.
Martin W. Littleton of Nev York
stood upon the stand amid applause to
place Judge Parker of New York in
nomination. Littleton's manner of
speaking is calm and deliberate, and he
used beautiful gestures. His voice is
full, resonant and of decidedly pleasing
quality, and could be heard farther
than that of any speaker who had pre
ceded him.
IJTTLETOX PRAISES PARKER.
Littleton was given close attention.
For the first time during -the session
there was silence in the hall, and his
f:ne voice suppreesed the fiend in the
gallery with the cry of "louder." His
speech was received with alternate
cheers and outbursts of approval 'and
A great hum of conversation and
noise of shuffling feet and scraping of
chairs mingled to drown the Virgin
ian's voice. Powerful as it is, he couW
not be heard ten rows of seats from the
stand on which he stood.
DANIEL HEADS PLATFORM.
An Ohio delegate mounted his chair
and after repeatedly addressing the
chairman in a loud manner demanded
order.
"Ail right; sit down and keep still
and we will have order," retorted
Clark. Then, turning to the clerk, he
directed again that the aisles be
cleared. Senator Daniel's exhaustion
from his long session with the resolu
tions committee was apparent. To the
vast audience which faced him he was
but a silent figure with moVing lips.
â¢ Ten minutes went by with the same
disorder, the reading of the platform
not being heard, when another inter
ruption was made at the instance of
CONVENTION HALL, St. Louis.
July S.â The crush of visitors around
the doors and inside the convention
hall at 8 o'clock, the time set for the
opening of the convention, was greater
than that at ar,y previous session. It
was something rÂ»r*!y paralleled at any
rational convention. Extras had spread
the news over town that a nomination
Â¦*as to be expected to-night, and the
crowd was greater than at any pre
vious session. At two or three en
trances the pressure on the doorkeepers
ar.d police.-r.en was so great that the
Iir.es were broken and many persons
without tickets forced their way into
the ball.
It is doubtful if ever before in any
large gathering in the United States,
were the rules governing admission to
a large convention so utterly ignored.
The doors were practically thrown open
to the public. In the gallery there was
rot an unoccupied inch cf standing: or
sitting room. The passageways under
the building were completely choked by
a pushing, struggling mass, with which
the sergeant-at-arms and police were
utterly unable to cope. Several thou
sand people wer* packed beneath the
â¢main floor, vainly trying to gain ad
mission to the auditorium. The con
.''^Â¦12 hÂ«-x-c was highly <Jangrerou3 in
itself, but still the crowd poured
through tho entrances and still no ef
fort was made to keep it bade
It was a crowd that, judging from
prevaiHaz symptoms, came with the
fall intention of participating in thÂ«Â»
proceedings, fcr cheers, applause and
comment were forthcoming upon every
c-casiorr.
The first reception of the evening was
piven to Senator Hill of New York.
who rr.ade his first appearance in the
hall.
HILL IS GIVEN" A RECEPTION*.
General Nelson A. Miles was also
present for the first time.
At S o'clock there was not a vacant
Beat in the vast auditorium. From
platform to topmost gallery tvas packed
with delegates, alternates and specta
tors The heat was already Intense.
On the outsi<3" the crowd was even
jri cater than within the Coliseum. So
Jar as the interest of the masses was
concerned the night's session was what
all strove to witness. Tickets sold so
' cheaply that they were within the
mr-ans o* all. Tho only trouble was
that the cheapest tickets were for ses
clonR gone by, and the buyer took his
own chances on getting by the door
ter^crs. Many of the bogus ticket
holdera got in and others less fortunate
blocked the entrances. The streets on
the four sides of the Colisetim were im
passable. Street cars get through with
difficulty and with danger to humani
ty. The police endeavored without ef
fect to keep the passageways citar.
Nothing, however, affected the mob, for
it was known that hundreds passed
through the doors who had r.o right to
cr.ter and that served to work the
throng into a frenzy. Long after the
hall was filled _the crowd pressed
u gainst the entrances, loth to give up
:he chance of getting In.
Frequently half a dozen people would
be allowed to enter on a single ticket. >
No attempt was rr.ade in many in-
Ftanccs to restrict the crowd in any
v/ay, and by the time the chairman
called the convention to order the hall
was filled to the danger line and be
yond.
CALLS CONTENTION' TO ORDER.
A series of energetic thumps upon
the presiding officer's table were given
by Chairman Clark at S:03 o'clock In
an endeavor to call the convention to
order. The reading clerk ordered the
floor oSlcers to clear the aisles. As
Clark stood at the desk Senator Dan
iel of Virginia, chairman of the reso
lutions committee, made his way to his
ride with a copy of the piatform in his
band.
Without delay it was announced that i
i he report of tho committee would be
i<-e<?i\'ed.
, ; At tbe statement the convention
relied the opportunity to express its
eatisfaction at the unanimous report.

JEWELS OF NOBLEMAN
ARE PRINCIPALLY PASTE
mounted two chairs in the California
delegation and waved a flag to and fro.
while a much leaner and somewhat
taller delegate beside him tossed a blua
banner up and down to the accompani
ment of three cheers for Hearst, which
were loyally echoed by the men of bis
State.
The band, nothing if. not Impartial.
played for Hearst "America" and fol
lowed it with "Dixie," as It had done
for Parker, and the result was the
same, with the exception that the
Hearst people did not attempt to sing.
COOL HIS ENTUrSIAM.
A red-headed enthusiast in a gray
suit was lifted up on the shoulders of
several men to the left of the speak
ers' platform nad cheered wildly for
Hearst, but he was soon compelled to
climb down, for his bright-colored hair
was too conspicuous a target for the
multitude of paper wads that came at
him from all sides. Water was thrown
on him, and in a few minutes lie
scrambled desperately for release.
When he reached the floor he re
marked. That water felt good." He
declined to give his name.
A second gentleman with red whisk
ers mounted a chair and attempted a
speech. He. too, was pelted down and
a policeman took him to the outer
, darkness.
Meantime the demonstration for the
editor candidate went on, rising and
falling In degrees. The band played
and the delegates, carrying Hearst
pictures and flags and State standards,
kept up their perspiring march through
the aisles. SÂ£S
A picture of Hearst swung from the
gallery opposite the speakers' stand
was the signal for a renewal of the
cheering, and it waved to and fro
in heavy volume as the picture was
waved frantically- by a fat man. Again
and again Hearst men marched around
"California." called the clerk.
"Mr. Chairman," responded Delegate
Tarpey, "California recognizes as her
spokesman D. M. Delmas."
"I recognize D. M. Delmas of Cali
fornia," said the chairman and a vol
ley of cheers came from the audience,
Bryan leading it by standing up and
waving a small American flag.
Delmas, who took the platform to
speak for Hearst, while not possessed
of a voice of a strong carrying quality,
could easily make himself heard by
the majority of the people in the hall.
Of greater age than Littleton he Is not
unlike him in figure, possessing a
strong, compact form, bordering some
what on the corpulent.
He spoke calmly and enunciated
clearly. His mention of the "gentle
man from Nebraska" called forth an
enthusiastic tribute.
Delmas' address, which closed with
the name "William Randolph Hearst, "
was the signal for cheers which, while
enthusiastic, were much less in volume
than those that followed the mention
of Parker's name.
A six-foot portrait of Hearst was
taken to the platform, another of simi
lar size was raised In the gallery back
of the platform and numerous smaller
portraits were shown on long poles
raised from among the delegations.
CALIFORNTANS IiEAD PARADE.
The parade around the hall which
had been carried on during the preced
ing demonstration was quickly under
taken, California 'leading off with its
great banner of white and gold, Ari
zona, Nevada, Iowa, South Dakota,
Washington and Wyoming joining in
the order named, some of them carry
ing pictures of Hearst. The banner of
the Illinois delegation was carried Into
the line but the majority of that dele
gation did not follow it. v At first but
few of them arose and only a fraction
of those followed their flag in the
march.
The galleries joined lustily in the
Hearst applause, making possibly a
stronger demonstration than they had
made for Parker.
'-: In marching around the hall many
of the Hearst enthusiasts stopped to
shake hands with Bryan, who remain
ed standing during the early part of
the demonstration. After a severe fit
of coughing, however, Bryan took his
seat-
Joseph Simmons of California, the
largest man in the convention, slipped
off his coat and vest and with his col
lar'wilted and his shirt bosom sticky.
Temporary Chairman Williams soon
came down the aisle, chewing leisure
ly at that ever-present cigar and was
greeted with cheers.
The band was requested to play
"On the Banks of the Wabash," and
the Indiana delegation showed its ap
preciation by climbing on chairs and
cheering lustily.
The messenger Chairman Clark
had sent to the committee on resolu
tions returned with a gloomy report
After the committee had been dis
patched to await the pleasure of the
resolutions committee the band gave a
concert of patriotic selections. Bourke
Cockran was called on to address the
convention, but he was not present.
Former Senator Charles A. Towne was
next invited to take the platform, but
declined. Captain Richmond P. Hob
son was the next choice, and he was
enthusiastically cheered. He spoke
principally in relation to the disfran
chisetnent plank of the Republican
platform and made an appeal to the
North and West to support the South
in the Dositlon the Democratic party
of that section has assumed between
whites and blacks.
Chairman Clark arrived at 10:10
o'clock. Twenty minutes after the del
egates were in their seats no word had
been received from the resolutions com
mittee, and Chairman Clark dispatched
a messenger to learn when it would be
ready to report. Private advices were
to the effect that it would be several
hours before the report could be pre
sented, and the prospects for a short
session grew stronger. One of the sec
retaries called through a megaphone,
"The band will please play 'Home,
Sweet Home.'-" There was a wild cheer
from the weary spectators as the fa
miliar strains floated out on the air.
Anything with the word "home"
seemed to please greatly, for the cheers
were repeated a few minutes later,
when "My Old Kentucky Home" was
rendered. "Dixie" called forth the in
evitable yells, and the Texas delega
tion added to the enthusiasm by un
furling their lone star flag and waving
It wildly.
The convention then took a recess
until 8 o'clock. Chairman Clark had
the convention in' hand from the mo
ment proceedings opened. He an
nounced through a strong-voiced as
sistant "that the first person raising a
row would be thrown out by the po
lice."
ST. LOUIS, July 8.â The Democratic
National Convention spent the morning
hours to-day in waiting for the report
of the committee on resolutions. A
committee was appointed by Chairman
Clark to call on the resolutions com
mittee and learn when the platform
would be submitted to the convention.
Just before the noon hour the conven
tion's emissaries announced that the
resolutions committee would . require
until 8 o'clock to-night to prepare its
report, but that the action of the com
mittee would be unanimous and a plat
form submitted which he declared
would bring the party a "glorious vic
tory."

The San Francisco Callit would be unwise to insist upon the
income tax plank.
Senator Bailey then asked unani
mous consent to have both the income
tax amendment and the gold standard
plank dropped, but to this Hill ob
jected and there was a prolonged dis
cussion, Hill taking a leading part in
it.
Hill began by saying that he was in
this campaign not from personal mo
tives, but because of his loyalty and
enthusiasm for the Democratic party.
' He hoped the party would cease its
discussion and agree upon a platform
in harmony with the views of the
party generally.
He was opposed to the' insertion of
an income tax plank, because he saw
no necessity for making this new is
sue.
"I believe," he said, "it will hurt
us, it will weaken our platform, but if
the members of this committee think
otherwise it should go in, but the
question of the gold standard is of far
more importance."
Hill urged that if the gold plank
were omitted the party would be
placed in a false position. If the party
was in favor of the free and unlimited
coinage of silver, that was another
thing. But through no fault of the
party conditions had changed and it
had been proven that the gold stand
ard was the solution of the question.
Although the Republican platform de
clared in favor of gold he pointed out
that the Democrats, in their platform,
could show that the Republicans wen*
rot responsible for the change in con
iitions which made the gold standard
desirable, but the Almighty himself.
HILL GROWS ELOQUENT.
Speaking directly to the Southern
members. Hill recalled the time of re
i construction and said he had always
I worked for Democratic principles
! along Democratic lines, that he had
been the friend of the South in that
trying period and since that time. Hill
talked eloquently of the personality
of Judge Parker. He said that in the
course of a conversation about ten
days ago with the New York jurist
the latter said in reply to a question
about the kind of platform the Dem
ocrats should adopt: "I am entirely
willing: to leave that to the wisdom of
the Democratic party."
But while Hill did not assume at
any time to speak for Judge Parker,
the committee interpreted the infer
ence of his speech to be that Judge
Parker favored the insertion of a gold
plank.
Hill declared that the Democrats
could not possibly nominate a better
man that Judge Parker. He was in
no sense an active candidate for the
nomination, and that he had not dic
tated anything regarding the plat
form.
"I do not think it is improper for
us to say who we want to win," con
tinued Hill. "We have stood defeats
in the past and we can stand them
again, it is true. This contest for me
means that I shall devote myself from
now until November to the campaign.
I shall work hard for whomsoever the
Democrats nominate, but I think the
platform is of the greatest importance
and especially the gold standard
plank."
Hill was applauded at the conclu
sion of his 8Deech.
Bryan replied at length and insist
ed that, in the face of past declara
tions, a gold plank would now alien
ate many thousands of Democratic
voters. He said that when the cam
paign for Judge Parker was started it
was never exnected that the Demo
cratic party was to be brought to a
declaration for the gold standard.
Thomas of Colorado also made a
strong protest against the gold stand
ard plank.
Senator Carmack of Tennessee
made a plea especially for the South
and said that Democratic success was
necessary in the face of the Repub
lican policy of imperialism. He hoped
some agreement, 'could be reached
which would bring to the support of
the Democratic South the Democratic
party of the East. It* to the money
question, that was for the time set
tled, and he urged that that matter
be not injected into the coming cam
paign.
Shiveley of Indiana followed much
in the same line as Carmack.
Fleming of Wisconsin was opposed
to the gold plank and favored the dec
laration of Williams' platform.
DANIEL ATTACKS BRYAN.
Shortly before 4 o'clock Senator Dan
iel created a sensation by an attack
upon Bryan, which soon evoked cries
for order. Senator Daniel, who some
time before called Senator Tillman to
the chair, began by saying he ques
tioned the propriety of a man whom the
j Democrats had twice honored with the
j Presidential nomination and under
whose leadership the party had twice
been defeated attempting to force his
leadership upon the party again. Grow
ing more impassioned, Daniel said:
"The silver question was a question
in Virginia ten years before the gen
tleman from Nebraska discovered it;
but conditions have changed, and heroic
changes demand heroic remedies. We
must consider New England, New York
and that section of the country."
Then, facing Bryan," Senator Daniel
said : "He has reviled every man whom
any State has recommended for the
Presidency, and so far as I have been
able to learn has yet presented no can
didate of his own."
At this point Senator Daniel was in
terrupted with cries of order. (
Bryan asked that Senator Daniel be
Bryan Gains Several Points During Con
troversy and Succeeds in Having
Gold Plank Withdrawn
Completely.
RESULT A COMPROMISE
ACCEPTABLE TO ALL AND u
ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY
I Bryan said that if his desired amend-
I ment to the trust plank should be
adopted he would not press the plank
favoring the Imposition of an income
tax. Senator Tillman. noting a smile
upon the faces of both Bryan and Hill,
remarked to Bryan that "since you and
Hill seem to have become so chummy.
I think we had better look further into
the trust plank."
WILL NOW OPPOSE BRYAN.
Dlscupslon of it thereupon was re
sumed, and Frank J. Cannon of Utah
took the floor.
"I fought for Bryan in 1S96 and 1900,**
he said, "on the paramount issues of
those campaigns, but now that he has
abandoned those issues I will vote
| against this proposition which he seems
I to want most."
I Cannon in conclusion contended that
the paramount issue in this campaign
was "victory," and that the issue
shoulJ be "Rooseveltism."
Bryan defended his position on the
trust question, saying that "victory"
alone should not essentially be the para
mount issue, and that unless a ques
tion was settled right it was never set
tled at all. Senator Daniel called Shive
ley to the chair and made a speech
supporting the principles of anti-trust
legislation. He took the position, how
ever, that if enforced the existing in
terstate commerce law and anti-trust
I statutes are sufficient, and he believed
a Democratic administration could be
pended on to enforce them. Hence
he considered it safe to omit the pro
posed plank.
i The committee resumed consideration
of the financial question on the basis
of the following plank, introduced by
Carmack:
"The Secretary of the Treasury shall
not melt the silver dollars that are now
legal tender and convert them into sub
sidiary coin, thus reducing the volume
of currency so fortunately increased by
the recent remarkable increase of the
gold production."
The Carmack suggestion for a finan
cial plank was voted down, and the
platform was adopted without a finan
cial plank.
Although the various planks had all
been agreed upon, there had been such
a number of changes made in the draft
of the document as presented by the
sub-committee as to render it impossi
ble to make a satisfactory report to the
convention before night.
As the /members emerged from the
chamber they generally expressed
themselves as satisfied with the work
they had accomplished, some of the ex
pressions heard being as follows:
SOME CRITICISMS.
Senator Danielâ "The platform was
unanimously adopted and Is reasonably
satisfactory."
Senator Tillman â "We have accom
plished a miracle; we have succeeded
in getting a platform without any poi
soning."
Bryan â "I am fairly well satisfied
with the platform. I have had oppor
tunity to-.present some matters as I
desired, and have had to make conces
sions in some instances in order to get
what I wanted in others."
"Will you support a ticket on this
platform?" was asked of him.
"I will certainly support the plat
form," was his reply, and this was said
In a way to convince his interrogator
that he fullyexpected to be able to sup
port both platform and ticket.
Ex-Senator Pettigrew â "We have pre
pared a treatise rather than a platform
and have succeeded in producing a
large volume without saying anything."
Senator Hill and Bryan came out to
gether and both were smiling. Bryan
said to the newspaper men:
"Now, boys, be sure and get Hills
platform right," and Hill retorted with
a laugh, "Think we %ill have to share
honors on that."
Bryan said: "We are satisfied. We
have all wanted some things put in
that the committee has rejected. But.
on the whole, the document is perfectly
satisfactory. You know, we can't get
everything we want."
Senator Hill said: "I am perfectly
satisfied. Of course, there are things
that I wanted in and thought should go
in, but politics is give and take, and
I am taking. I should have liked to
have seen an expression on finances In
the platform, but the majority thought
otherwise, and neither Bryan's plank
nor' mine was adopted. You will re
member that the New York State Con
vention made no mention of the finan
cial question, and so this platform is
similar. We did not put in an income
tax plank, and we changed only slight
ly the tariff plank."
"Will Ju3gi Parker stand on tho
platform?*
"I do not see why not. I am said to
be 'his friend,' " he answered smiling,
"and I am satisfied."
AUGUST BEL1IONT SATISFIED.
August Belmont said he was satisfied
that the platform was one on which
Judge Parker could stand. He said: "1
have always been quiteXwHHng to have
a platform without any financial plank
In it. I believe the people have finally
settled the matter, and It is superfluous
for any party to merely reiterate."
Governor Thomas of Colorado said:
"I succeeded in securing tha incorpora
tion of the greater part of my labor
declaration, and. on the whole, I am
satisfied with the platform."
John Sharp Williams, who made the
original draft "ol the platform, said: "I
am delighted with it."
The anti-Parker people were jubilant
over the matter when, they heard of the
disposition of the financial plank.
allowed to proceed, and the latter re
sumed. Continuing the Senator said:
"I am convinced that the country is
on the verge of a great calamity. This
is not the time for selfish interest, for
small conceptions of consistency, for
personal likes or regards."
Senator Daniel favored the gold
plank.
Poe of Maryland made a brief but
vigorous appeal for the gold plank, de
claring that if the party in Its platform
refused to recognize an existing fact he
feared that Maryland would be lost to
the Democrats. He pointed out that the
gold plank recommended by the sub
committee was one which the silver
and gold elements in the party could
easily stand upon. He said that this
plank did not call on the free silver ;
advocates to retract or repudiate their
former beliefs.
GOLD PLANK STRICKEN OUT.
"It is simply," he said, "a recognition
of an existing fact." Poe declared the
Democratic ticket would have a forlorn
hope if the plank were omitted.
After several other members had been
heard briefly the question was demand
ed. The gold plank was stricken out
by a vot of 35 to 15.
Early in the night Bryan had with
drawn temporarily his income tax reso
lution. At this Juncture an attempt
was made to secure a recess, but it was
unsuccessful, Senator Tillman remark- 1
ing that "it was sun-up and we might I
as well go ahead."
Bryan got the floor soon after the
adoption of the motion striking out the
gold plank and informally presented for |
the individual consideration of the
members a financial plank, which it is
his intention later to present as a sub
stitute for the gold plank.
The Panama canal plank brought
out severe criticism from Senator Petti
grew. He said that the canal could not
be, built in ten years, and when com
pleted it would be valueless. The
plank was modified so as to promise to
do what could be done when the Dem
ocrats got control of the Government.
The comhnittee took up the trust
plank. This was the subject of consid
erable discussion, Senator Bailey be
ing among the more important speak
ers in defense of the sub-committee'3
report.
Bryan offered an amendment to this
plank declaring in specific terms for
the prosecution of the trusts, and re
citing the manner in which it should
be done. This was voted in by 23 to
20.
The majority of the votes came from
Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, Ne
braska, Wyoming, the Territories, Por
to Rico and Hawaii, while the negative
votes were from the East and South.
Severe comments were made by a
number of representatives from these
States to the effect that radical amend
ments were being forced into the plat
form by men from Republican States
and Territories which could not con
tribute a single electoral vote to the
Democratic candidate. Pettigrew of
â¢fered an amendment providing for the
Government ownership of railroads
and telegraphs.
"Oh, that's silly," said Senator Hill.
The amendment was voted down and
Pettigrew remarked: "The gentleman
from New York called the amendment
silly, but he put ti plank in the plat
form two years ago not only for the
Government ownership of the coal
carrying railroads, but for the coal
mines as well. And the ticket got a
larger majority in New York City
than was ever before given a Demo
cratic candidate."
NO MENTION OF NAVY.
Reciprocity and the Monroe doc
trine as handled by the sub-committee
met the approval of the full commit
tee. But not so with the navy plank,
calling for a liberal annual increase
of the navy.
Senator Tillman said this plank
would gain no votes and there was no
necessity of jnentioning the navy.
The first part of the navy plank was
stricken out.
The plank proposed by ex-Governor
Thomas of Colorado regarding labor
was adopted by the committee.
The committee after a lengthy de
bate adopted the plank relating to sep
arate statehood, offered by Delegate
W. F. Timmons of Arizona with re
spect to Arizona and New Mexico, as
follows:
"We favor the immediate admission
of the Territories of Arizona and New-
Mexico as separate States."
In dealing with the success of state
hood for Oklahoma and Indian Ter
ritory the committee was less em
phatic in its declaration, confining the
plank to a general recommendation
of statehood for these two Territories
as follows:
"We favor the admission of the Ter
ritory of Oklahoma and Indian Terri
tory."
The currency plank offered by Bryan
was referred to a sub-committee, con
sisting of Williams, Bryan and Hill,
with authority to draft a financial
plank for submission to the full com
mittee. The opinion was expressed that
these men might agree upon some
| thing, and if they should it would prob
j ably eliminate any fight on the floor of
the convention.
One of the Western members said
that he did not expect Bryan to make
a minority report in view of the mauy
changes he had been able to procure in
the platform.
When at 8:30. a. m. the last plank as
drafted by the sub-committee had been
read the members of the committee ap
plauded-
THE Democratic party of the United States, in
national convention assembled, declares its
devotion to the essential principles of' the
Democratic faith, which brings us together in
party communion.
Under them local self-government and national
unity and prosperity were alike established. They
underlaid our independence, the structure of our free
republic and every Democratic extension from Louis
iana to California and Texas to Oregon, which pre
served faithfully in all the States the tie between
the nation and representation. They yet inspire the
masses of our people, guarding jealously their rights
and liberties and cherishing their fraternity, peace
and orderly development. They remind us of our
duties and responsibilities , as citizens and impress
upon us, particularly at this time, the necessity of
reform.
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES.
1. The application of these fundamental princi
ples to the living issues of the day is the first step
toward the assured peace, safety and progress of our
nation. Freedom of the press, of conscience and of
speech â equality. â¢
The law of all citizens: right of trial by jury free
dom of the person defended by the writ of habeas
corpus; liberty of personal contract untrammeled
by sumptuary laws; supremacy of the civil over the
military authority; a well disciplined militia; the
separation of church and state; economy in expendi
tures; low taxes, that labor may be lightly burdened;
prompt and sacred fulfillment of public and private
obligations; fidelity to treatfes, peace and friendship
with all nations; entanglling alliances with none;
absolute acquiescence in the will of the majority, the
vital principle of republics â these are doctrines
which Democracy has established as proverbs of the
nation and they should be constantly enforced.
CAPITAL AND LABOR.
We favor enactment and administration of laws
giving labor and capital impartially their Just rights.
Capital and labor ought not to be enemies. Each
is necessary to the other. Each has Its rights, but
the rights of labor are certainly no less "vested,"
no less "sacred" and no less "inalienable" than the
rights of capital.
CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE.
Constitutional guarantees are A'iolated whenever
any citizen is denied the right to labor,' acquire and
enjoy property or reside where interest or inclination
may determine. Any denial thereof by individuals
or organizations of Government should be summarily
rebuked and punished.
We deny the right of any executive to disregard
or suspend any constitutional privilege or limitation.
Obedience to the laws and respect for their require
ments are alike the supreme duty of the citizen and
the official.
The military should be used only to support and
maintain the law. We unqualifiedly condemn its em
ployment for the summary banishment of citizens
without trial, or for the control of elections.
We approve the measure which passed the United
States Senate in 1896, but which a Republican Con
gress has ever since refused to enact, relating to
contempts in Federal courts and providing for trial
by jury in cases of indirect contempt. .
WATERWAYS. , -
We favor liberal appropriations for the care and
improvement of the waterways of the country. When
any waterway like the Mississippi River is of suf-' '
ficient importance to demand special aid-of the Gov
eminent, such aid should be extended with a defin
ite plan of continuous work until permanent im
provement is secured.
We oppose the Republican policy of starving home
development in order to feed the greed for conquest
and the appetite for national "prestige" and display
of strength.
ECONOMY OF ADMINISTRATION.
1. Large reductions can easily be made in the an
nual expenditures of the Government without im-'
pairing the efficiency of any branch of ,the public
service, and we shall insist upon the strictest econ
omy and frugality compatible with vigorous and ef
fective civil, military and naval administration for
the people.
2. We favor honesty in the public service, the
enforcement of honesty in the public service, and to
that end a thorough legislative investigation of those
departments of the Government already known to
teem with corruptldn, as well as other departments
suspected of harboring corruption, and punishment
of ascertained corruptlonists without fear or favor
or regard to persons. The persistent and deliberate
refusal of both the Senate and House of Represent
atives to permit such investigation to be made dem
onstrates that only by a change in the executive and
in the legislative departments can complete expo
sure, punishment and conviction be obtained.
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WITH TRUSTS.
We condemn the action of the Republican party
in Congress in refusing to prohibit the executive de
partments from entering into contracts with con
victed trusts or unlawful' combinations in restraint
of interstate trade. We have one of the best meth
ods of procuring economy and honesty In the public
service and that is to have public officials, from the
occupant of the White House, down to the lowest of
them, return as nearly as may be to Jeffersonian
simplicity of living.
EXECUTIVE 'USURPATION.
We favor the nomination and election of a Pres
ident imbued with the principles of the constitution,
who will set his face sternly against executive usur
pation of legislative and judicial functions, whether
that usurpation be veiled under the guise of execu
tive construction of existing laws or whether it take3
refuge in the tyrant's pleas of necessity or superior
wisdom.
IMPERIALISM.
We favor the preservation so far as we can of an
open door for tho world's commerce in the Orient
without an unnecessary entanglement in Oriental
and European affairs and without arbitrary, unlim
ited, irresponsible and absolute government any
where within our jurisdiction.
We oppose fervently as did George. Washington
himself an indefinite, irresponsible, discretionary and
vague absolutism and a policy of colonial exploita
tion, no matter where or by whom exercised; we be
lieve with Thomas Jefferson and John Adams that
no government has a right to make one set of la\V3
for those "at home" and another and a different
set of laws, absolute in their character," for those "in
the colonies." .
All men under the American flag are entitled to
the protection of the institutions whose emblem the
Hag is. If they are Inherently unfit to be members
of the American body politic, or wherever there may
exist a people incapable of being governed by Amer
ican laws under the American constitution, the ter
ritory or people ought not to be a part of the Ameri
can domain. We insist that we ought to do for the
Filipinos what we have done already for the Cu
bans, and it is our duty to make that promise now
and, upon suitable guarantees of protection to â¢ citi
zens of our own and other countries resident there
at the time of our withdrawal, Bet the Filipino peo
ple upon their feet, free and independent to work
out their own destiny.
The endeavor of the Secretary of War, by pledg
ing the Government's indorsement for "promoters"
In the Philippine Islands, to make the United States
a partner in speculative legislation of the archipej
ago, which was only temporarly held up by the op
position of the Democratic Senators in the last ses
sion, will, if successful, lead to entanglements from
which it will be difficult to escape.
The Democratic party has-been and will. continue
to be the consistent opponent of that class of tariff
legislation by which certain interests have been-per
mitted, through Congressional favor, to draw a heavy
tribute from the American people. This monstrous
perversion of. those equal opportunities which our
political institutions were established to secure has
. caused what may once have been infant industries
to become "the greatest combinations of capital that
the world has .ever known. These special favorites
of the Government have, through trust methods, been
converted into monopolies, thus bringing to an end
domestic competition, which was the only alleged
check upon the extravagant profits made possible by
the protective system. These industrial combina
tions, by the financial assistance they can give, now
control "the policy of the Republican party.
We denounce protection as a robbery of the many
to enrich the few, and we favor a tariff limited to
the necessities of the Government economically ad
ministered and so levied as not to/ discriminate against
any industry, class or section, /to the end that the
burden of taxation shall be distributed as equally as
possible.
We favor a revision and a gradual reduction of the
tariff by the friends of the masses and for the com
mon weal and not by the friends of its abuses, its
extortions and its discriminations, keeping in view
the ultimate ends of "equality of burdens" and
"equality of .opportunities" and the sole purpose of
raising a revenue by taxation, to wit, the support of
the Federal Government in all its integrity and viril
ity, but in simplicity.
TRUSTS AXD UNLAWFUL COMBINATIONS.
We recognize that the gigantic trusts and combinations de
signed to enable capital to secure more than Its Just share of
the joint products of capital and labor and which have been
fostered and promoted under Republican rule are a menace to
beneficial competition and an obstacle to permanent business
prosperity. A private monopoly Is- Indefensible and Intolerable.
Individual equality of opportunity and free competition are
essential to a healthy and permanent commercial prosperity, and
any trust combination or monopoly tending to destroy these by
controlling production, restricting competition or fixing prices
should be prohibited and punished by law. "We especially de
nounce rebates and discrimination by the transportation com
panies as the most potent agency In promoting and strengthening
these unlawful conspiracies against trade.
We demand an enlargement of the powers of- the Interstate
Commerce Commission, to the end that the traveling public and
shippers of this country may have prompt and adequate relief
from the abuses to which they are subject in the matter of
transportation. W e demand a strict enforcement of existing civil
and criminal statutes against all such trusts, combinations and
monopolies, and we demand the enactment of such further legis
lation as may be necessary to effectually suppress them.
Any trust or unlawful combination engaged In interstate com
merce which Is monopolizing any branch of business or produc
tion should not be permitted to transact business outside of the
State of Its origin. Whenever it shall be eetablfuhed in any court
of competent Jurisdiction that such monopolization oxlstB such pro
hibition should be enforced through comprehensive laws to be
enacted on the ttubject. .
RECLAMATION OF ARID LANDS.
We congratulate our Western citizens upon the passage of the
law known as the Newlands irrigation act for the Irrigation and
reclamation of the nrid lands of the West â a measure framed
by a Democrat, paised in the Senate by a non-partisan vote and
passed In the Home against the opposition of almost all the Re
publican leaders by a vote the majority of which was Demo
cratic. We call attention to this great Democratic measure,
broad and comprehensive as It Is, working automatically through
out all time without further action of Congress until the reclama
tion of all the Ian Is In the arid West capable of reclamation Is
accomplished, reserving the lands reclaimed for homeseekers In
email tracts and r'Rldly guarding against land monopoly, as an
evidence of the poll ;y of domestic development contemplated by
the Democratic par.y, should it be placed in power.
ISTHMIAN CANAL.
The Democracy when entrusted with power 5 will construct the
Panama canal speedily, honestly and economically, thereby
giving to our people what Democrats have always contended for
â a great inter-oceanic caral, furnishing shorter and cheaper
lines of transportation and broader and less trammeled trade re
lations with the other peoples of the world.
AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP.
We pledge ourselves to insist upon the just and lawful pro
tection of our, citizens at home and abroad and to use all proper
rneasures' to secure for them, whether native born or naturalized,
â¢and without distinction of race or creed, the equal protection of
laws and the enjoyment of all rights and privileges open to
them under the covenants of our treaties of friendship and com
merce; and if under existing treaties the right of travel and so
journ Is denied to American citizens or recognition Is withheld
from American passf>orts by any countries on the ground of race
and creed we favor the beginning of negotiations with the Gov
ernments of such countries to secure by treaty the removal of
these unjust discriminations.
We demand that all over the world a duly authenticated pass
port Issued by the Government of the United States to an Ameri
can citizen shall b; proof of the fact that he is an American
citizen and ehall entitle him to the treatment due him as such.
ELECTION* OF SENATORS BY THE PEOPLE.
We favor the election of United States Senators by the direct
vote of the people.
STATEHOOD FOR THE TERRITORIES.
We favor the admission of the Territory of Oklahoma and
the Indian Territory. We also favor the Immediate admission
of Arizona and New Mexico as separate States and the terri
torial government for Alaska and Porto Rico.
We hold that the officiate appointed to administer the govern
ment of any Territory as well as with the District of Alaska
should be bona fide residents at the time of thrlr appointment of
the Territory or the district in which their duties are to be per
formed.
MERCHANT MARINE.
We d*noun"e thÂ« ship subsidy bill recently passed by the
United State* Srnatj as an iniquitous appropriation of public funds
for private purpO3Pg and a wasteful, illogical and useless at
tempt to overcome by subsidy obstructions raised by Republican
legislation to the g.-owth and development of American commerce
on the aea. "
We favor the unbuilding of a merchant marine without new
or additional burd ns upon the people and without bounties from
the public treasury.
We demand th â¢ extermination of polygamy within- the juris
diction of the United States and the complete separation of
church and state 1 1 political affairs. '
RECIPROCITY.
AVe favor libera" trade arrangements with Canada and with
pÂ«oples of other c untrles where they can be entered into with
benefit to the American agriculture, manufactures, mining or
commerce. s
MONROE DOCTRINEJ
*We favor the maintenance of the Monroe doctrine in its full
entirety.
NAVY AND AP.MY.
We favor tho reduction of the army and navy expenditures ,
to the point historically demonstrated to be safe and sufficient.
The Democracy would secure to the surviving soldiers and
sailors and their dependents generous pensions, not by arbitrary
executive order, but by legislation which a grateful people
stand ready tn enact.
Our soldiers and iÂ«niloriÂ» who defmd with their lives the con
stitution and the Iws have a sacred interest in their Just ad
ministration. They mm, therefore, share with uÂ« the humilia
tion with which we have witnessed the exaltation of th<" court
favorites, without distinguished service, over the Fcarred heroes
of rosiny hattlrs or aggrandized by executive appropriations out
of the treasures of a prostrate people In violation of the act of
Congress which fixed ths compensation and . allowances of the
military officers.
The Democratic party stands committed to the principles nt
civil pervlce reform and we demand their hon<*?t. Just and
impartial enforeemrnt. We denounce the Republican party for
Its continuous encroachment upon the spirit and operation of
civil service rules, whereby It has arbitrarily dispensed with ex
aminations for office In the Interests of favorites and employed
all manner of devlias to overreach nnd set aside the principles
upon which the civil service was established.
SCHOOL AND RACE QUESTION.
%' The race quÂ»stlnn has brought countless woes to thl* country.
TIip calm wisdom or the American people should see to it that
It brings no more.
To revive the d:ad and hateful race and sectional animosities
In any part of pur common country means confusion, distraction
of business and tV reopening of wounds now happily hsaled.
North. South. Fas' and West have recently stood together In
line "of battle f ro n the walls of Pekln* to the hills of Santiago
and as sharers of a common glory nnd a rommon destiny we
phould ohare fraternnlly the common burdens.
, We therefore deprecate and condemn the Bourbon-like, selfish
and narrow spirit of the recent Republican convention at Chicago
which sought to kindle anew racial and factional strife and we
appeal, to the pob r common sense and patriotic spirit of the.
American people.
REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION.
The existing Republican administration has been spasmodic,
(spectacular and nrb'trary. It has made itself a satire upon the
Congress, the courts and upon the settled practices and usages
of national and ln*Â« rrmtiona! law.
It summoned t*>Â» Congress Into hasty and futile extra session
and virtually aujo irrÂ«cl H. leaving behind ItH'fllght from Wash
ington'uncalled calendars and unaccomplished tasks.
It made war. which Is the sole power of Congress, without
Its authority, thereby usurping its fundamental prerogatives. It
violated a statute of the United States as well as plain treaty
obligations. International usages 'and constitutional law, and
hRÂ« done so under pretense, of executing a great public, policy
which could hnvs been more easily effected lawfully, constitu
tionally and with honor. *
It forced strained and unnatural constructions upon statutes,
usurping judicial Â¦ Interpretation and substituting Congressional
enactments. â¢â¢Â¦..â¢
It withdrew . from Congress the customary dutlea of Investiga
tion which have heretofore made the representatives of the peo
ple and States, the terror of evil doers.
It conducted a secretive Investigation of Its own and boasted
of a few sample convictions. < while It threw n broad coverlet over
the bureaus which had been their chosen field of operative abuses
and kept In power the superior officers under whose administra
tion the crimes had been committed.
It ordered nswiult upon some monopolies, but. paralyzed by Its*
first victory. It flung out the Mac of truce and declared thatÂ»it
would rrnt "run amuck,"- leaving Its future purposes beclouded by
Its vacillations.-
APPEAL TO THE COUNTRY.
Conducting the campaign upon this declaration of our princi
ples and purposes, we invoke for our candidates the support not
only of ovr. great and time-honored organization, but also the ac
tive assistance, of all - our fellow-citizens who. disregarding past
â¢ differences upon questions no longer in issue, Â¦ desire the perpetua
tion of our constitutional government as framed and ectabllshed
by the fathers of the republic.

COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS STRUGGLES SIXTEEN HOUR CONSTRUCTING PLATFORM
New York Senator and Nebraskan Bury
the Hatchet, However, and Leave
the Conference Chamber
Arm in Arm.
HILL -HAS HOT VERBAL
ENCOUNTER WITH BRYAN,
WHOM DANIEL ATTACKS
.Senator Bailey and Senator TiUman.
while believing in an Income tax. said
that in view of the statement of the
Nsw York member of the committee.
ST. LOUIS. July 8.â After a continu
ous session cf sixteen hours the com
mittee on resolutions perfected the
platform and adjourned just before
noon, instructing its sub-cominittee to
arrange the draft for submission to the
general committee at 6 o'clock, to be
reported to the convention two hours
later.
The platform is a compromise ac
ceptable to all of the interests involved
and was adopted unanimously by the
committee. It may be said in a general
way to have been a concession to the
Bryan wing of the party without in
any way stifling the declarations of the
conservatives. The absence of any pro
r.otincement on the financial question
is most significant and discloses the
utter impossibility of finding any decla
ration upon this subject acceptable to
all.
The committee spent the entire night
Â«>n the platform, and at 8:30 o'clock
considered the last resolutions which
had been made by the sub-com
mittee. But this did not mean that the
platform was finished and ready fur
the convention. The struggle contin
ued, and at 10 o'clock it was clear that
an agreement on the document as a
whole could not be reached immediate
ly. During the watch of the long night
la the committee there were many dra
matic scenes, not the least striking of
which was the verbal encounter be
tween Senator Hill and Bryan. It oc
curred while Bryan was engaged in
n^aking one cf his many attacks upon
the gold standard plank as framed by
the sub-committee. He was wrought
up to a high tension when, approach
ing the New York leader and shaking
his finger dangerously close to the nor*.
Â«'f that gentleman, he exclaimed: ;
"You ought to have a gold platform
to go with the gold candidate you are i
forcing upon the country."
Hill replied that he knew nothing as
to Parker's monetary views.
â¢Do you mean to say," demanded the
Nebraskan, "that you don't know
Judge Parker's financial views?"
"I mean just that," responded Hill.
"You hav* no knowledge on that sub
ject?"
"Xone."
"Have you never asked him?"
NEVER ASKED PARKER.
"I have not. I have never sought to
secure an expression of his views, and
he never sought to convey them to me.
1 only know that he is a Democrat and
a high-minded and patriotic man, and
I believe that he can be trusted implic
itly on this as upon other matters of
public policy."
Bryan then demanded to know when
the gold plank had been decided upon
and why it had not been incorporated
in the New York platform.
Hi'.l replied that the matter had first
been discussed at the meeting of the
delegates about ten days ago and that
the declaration was the result of insist
ence by other members of the delega
tion than himself.
At 4:4 0 this morning the committee
voted the gold standard plank out of
the Democratic platform by a vote of
35 to 15. This was the third Victory
for William J. Bryan during the all
night session of the committee. He
had made two successful efforts early
in the evening and secured modifica
tions of the tariff plank on two separ
ate votes.
An effort was made to secure a re
cess after the vote on the gold plank.
but it was voted down and the com
mittee continued with its work on
other features of the platform.
The contest was one of the most in
teresting features of the convention.
The main fight was upon a proposed
income tax providing for an amend
ment to the constitution to meet the
ad\ersc decision of the Supreme Court
upon the Wilson law. It was upon this
amendment and the gold plank, the
two propoÂ«itions having been brought
in conjunction, that Bryan made his
strong fight. Williams of Mississippi
firet offpred the income tax amend
ment and it was immediately antag
onized by former Senator Hill, who
Mated that with such a plank in the
j;latform New York could not be car
ried for the Democratic nominees. He
urg.d the adoption of a platform
Â¦which will enable the Democrats to
win in doubtful States and elect their
candidates. Williams withdrew hi3
amendment, saying that he, with many
others, was seeking harmony and an
adjustment of all difficulties, with a
view of succeeding upon a Democratic
platform.
INCOME TAX AMENDMENT.
Rryan mn.de an income tax amend
ment. He asserted that while votes
might be lost among the very rich, the
Democratic party ought to consider
:hf great mass of the people, who bear |
the burdens of taxation and the ex
j.enses of the Government.
Senator Daniel replied to Bryan and
was very vigorous In his denunciation
of the course the Nebraska man was
pursuing. He said that he wanted to
%v{n. and desired a platform which
would bring to the Democratic party
the voters who had left it when pur
suing r. course which rryan had
shaped and advocated. He was tired
of being forever in the minority and
insisted that it would be absurd for
Democrats, facing victor;-, to take any
action which would mean defeat.' To
lose New York meant defeat. i

MONARCHISTS FEAR RESULT
OF ACTIVITY OF EDWARD
Think Kins Is Risking Grave Compli

of British Constitutionalism.
VIENNA, July 8. â Francis Joseph
and othfer devoted monarchists of this
entourage are disturbed by the ac
tivity of King Edward in practical In
ternational politics. They fear that
the King, who is drawing attention to
himself as the initiator of great poli
cies, is deviating from the straight
path of British constitutionalism and
Is risking grave complications with
public opinion. They argue that If
the British people should be drawn
into an unfortunate treaty â with Ger
many, for example â they would hold
the King responsible, and the mon
archic system of England would suffer
severe strain. Telegrams to the Vienna
press state that similar arguments are
finding lodgment in thoughtful minds
in Great Britain.

John E. Graves made elaborate prep
arations to go into tha retail fruit busi
ness, but was prevented, he says, by
the organizations of the wholesalers
and retailers already engaged in that
line of trade. In the expectation of re
covering the money he had expended,
and further damages, he yesterday
brought suit in the Superior Court for
$10,000, and named as defendants the
Wholesale Fruit and Produce Mer
chants' Association, the Retail Fruit
Dealers* Association, L. Scatena, Gar
cia A. Maggini, Van Husen & Co., the
American Produce Company, Wetmore
Bros, and Julius Zenter.
Graves alleges that the wholesale as
sociation entered into an unlawful and
illegal agreement that none of its mem
bers should sell any produce to any
person not in good standing as a mem
ber of the retail association, and none
of the members of the retail associa
tion should patronize any one not a
member of the wholesale association.
The plaintiff says that he applied for
membership in the retail association
and tendered the $5 fee, which was re
fused. He attempted to buy from mem
bers of the wholesale association and
they would not sell to him. Further
more, he declares the latter organiza
tion printed his name In a "blacklist"
He says that he lost $5000 by Injury to
his business, $350 which he spent to fit
up his place. $130 in rent paid and $25
expended for printing.

ANACONDA, Mont., July 8.â Two
boys, Phil Danley and Jimmie Spell
man of this city, unearthed a myste
rious treasure chest to-day while dig
ging in a bank at the head of Maple
street and the find has aroused consid
erable interest. The box uncovered by
the lads Is about fourteen inches
square, is made of heavy stuff and is
bound with heavy iron .bands. It was
found io contain a small diamond pin,
two unset opals, several pieces of gold
quartz, pieces of copper ore, a brooch
aet with small pearls, two unset imita
tion diamonds and copper nuggets. In
the box was found a letter written on
pieces of paper so badly decayed as to
be almost entirely illegible. A few
words written in a large hand were de
ciphered, and they seemed to indicate
that the chest contained the secret of
greater treasures hidden perhaps in
some other place. The following is all
that could be made out of the message:
"This chest contains key to chest
which is burled . Dig at dig
ne Gold ."
A key was found in the chest 'and
why, the thing was burled is a complete
mystery. The chest had evidently been
in the ground for years.

NEW YORK, July 8.â With all the
stateliness that goes with 40.000 tons
displacement the Baltic, the greatest
of ocean steamships, moved up the bay
early this morning and, aided by a
flotilla of puffing tugs, ranged her tre
mendous bulk against her North River
pier. \\ had been predicted that the
Baltic"would reach port the day before,
but thick weather forced the steamship
to run at reduced speed during the lat
ter part of her Journey and eventually
compelled her to seek an overnight
anchorage outside the bar. This
brought her up the river at an hour
when, few were about to bid her wel
come, and, save for the whistles o'f a
few ferry- DOats a^^ tugs, the arrival
of this queen of trans-Atlantic steam
ships .was almost unmarked.
There were few at the pier to meet
the vessel. Those who climbed the
gangplank to the main deck of the liner
were amazed at the long vista of deck
space and the great beam of the
mighty vessel. Entering the main
doorway one could see a maze of com
panlonways leading to the decks be
neath and to those above. Standing on
the main deck, four decks are under
foot, while four more rise overhead, the
top deck being eighty feet above the
water. One' of the most striking fea
tures of the big vessel Is the great
dining saloon, an apartment extend
ing the full width of the ship and
having a seating capacity for 375 per

SPEAKS FOR TENNESSEE.
ST. LOUIS, July 8.â Senator Car
mack of Tennessee, wht> seconded the
nomination of Alton B. Parker, spoke
as follows:
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the conven
tion: I speak for the State which holds In
her boscm the ashes of Old Hickory and among
whose people his spirit Is abroad.
In few words and simple fashion I shall
discharge the duty imposed upon me by my
delegation and by the unanimous voice of the
Democracy of Tennessee.
One of the largest and most representative
State conventions that ever assembled, with
unparalleled enthusiasm and without one dis
senting voice. Instructed us to cast the vote
of Tennessee for that profound Jurist, that un
faltering Democrat, that stainless gentleman,
Alton B. Parker of New York.
This was not done in haste, but after mature
deliberation In which the character and quali
ties of every possible nominee were carefully
weighed in the balance. Nor did we fall to
consider all the criticisms that have been made
against him, with the result that In our judg
ment the character of our candidate stands
out clean and clear, unspotted by the reckless
defamation that has raged around It.
I should not longer detain this convention
but that some of these criticisms seem to de
mand a passing notice. The fact that Judge
Parker Is being supported by men who are
blesoed with a larger amount of the world's
good9 than most of us have been able to as
semble Is being strangely urged as an objection
to his nomination. Sir, I deny that the Demo
cratic party Is the party for the poor man
alone. It Is the party for every rich man who
respects the rights of the poor, and it Is the
party of every man who wants to be rich. It
Is the party of every man who loves his liberty,
and it Is also the party of every man who loves
the dollar he has earned honestly and the se
curity of the property that Is rightfully his. No
man Is barred from Its councils because he is
poor and no man Is barred because he is rich.
I believe It was a Democratic convention of
which It was written, "The rich and the poor
meet together; the Lord is the maker of them
all."
The charge has been recklessly made that
the influences of Wall street are behind the
candidacy of , this upright and Incorruptible
Judge. \r-
The charge Is , based upon no scintilla of
evidence, or upon such evidence only as no
adult understanding ever before stooped to
consider. I can tell the author of this accu
sation that the power of Wall street has in a

ST. LOUIS. July 8.â With all the
grace of oratory for which the San

Delmas placed the name of William
Randolph Hearst before the convention
as a candidate for the Presidential
nomination. Delmas said:
For the first time In history California pre
sents as a candidate for the great office of
chief executive of the republic one born and
reared upon her soil. She bespeaks your In
dulgence while she sets forth the motive*
which animate her hopes and the claims which
Justify the aspirations of her son.
Do you war.t as your nominee a man whoaa
past political career stands as an assurance
of victory in the future? California's candi

Imperial State, which Is now his home. To
the realization of your hopes the vote of that
State Is indispensable. Without New York ii

the experience of the past answer. Less than
two years ago he ran for Congress in a dis
trict which the year before had given the
Democratic nominee for Mayor of Greater New
York a majority of only 1SC0. That district
he carried by more than ltJ.OOO. Such a ma
jority exceeds by over 200O that given in the
same district a few years ago to the learned
and distinguished jurist who was then elected
Chief Justice of the State; and It U greater
by nearly 5000 than that given a year later to
the Democratic candidate for Mayor, though
he threw into the contest that which posterity
accords to an honored and historic name. That
majority represented seventy-two out of every
one hundred votes cast.
Was such a percentage ever before equaled T
Was such a maiorlty before attained? Was
a triumph so complete ever before achieved in
any Congressional district of New York?
Never. If. instead of running in a mere dis
trict he who won this unprecedented victory
had been a candidate In the whole municipality
h? would, according to this ratio, have car
ried the city of New York by a majority of
230.000. Had he been running in the State
at large â even conceding to hts adversary the
preponderance customarily claimed by the Re
publicans In the rural districts â he would
have carried the State by a majority of 130. Ouv.
FAITHFUL TO PARTY.
Gentlemen. If it be true tliat the State of
New York is indlsDensable to your success
who is the man that affords equal guarant3es
of his ability to carry it? Will you find him
in a stranger to that State? Or will you
find him in either of the men whose ma-
Jorfties our candidate has thus already
eclipsed at the polls? Do you want a nominee
of proved and unquestioned fidelity to your
party?
Where will you find one whose party fealty
can claim superiority to his in hours which
tried men's souls? Others have deserted the
ships In the days when idolatrous allurements
were spread forth: others have foresworn the
faith of their fathers and have prostrated
themselves before the golden calf. His al
legiance has not wavered; his devotion hast
been marred by no scheme. In prosperity an<l
In adversity. In sunshine and in storm, through
good and evil repute, his Democracy has re
mained steadfast and
"Constant as the northern star, of whose true,
fixed and resting quality
"There is no fellow in the firmament."
During the five Presidential elections which
have taken olace since he has reached man
hood's estate he has ever abandoned personal
preferences, surrendered individual opinions
and ungrudgingly acquiesced as soon as th>:
party's choice has been made and its creed pro
claimed. Three times did he support Grover
Cleveland and twice him who yonder sits and
who, untouched by ephemeral obliquity, mis
representation and slander, will bequeath pos
terity a name as pure, a character as lofty
and a fame as bright as any recorded In th?
annals of Democracy.
Nor does the fealty of our candidate belong
to the past alone. It exists to-day In ampli
tude as complete. In devotion as absolute as
of yore. Though aspiring to this nomination.
yet If your assembled wisdom shall deem an
other worthier he will not be found a discon

will he be found organizing fellow-desertera
Into marauding bands of hostile malcontents.
No. and, above all. will he not be foun<l

Its overthrow. Even though disappointed In
his aspirations, he will remain at his post.

nomination of Judge Parker, said:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Con
vention: The Democracy of Connecticut, which
I have upon this occasion the great honor of
representing, has a vital interest in the result
of the coming campaign. I therefore crave, at
the. hands of this great convention, the priv
ilege of a few moments In which briefly fÂ»
set forth the wishes of, the Democrats of that
doubtful and essential ' State. It is out wish,
our hope and our purpose to present to the
Democracy of the nation the seven electoral
votes of the old constitutional State of
Connecticut. We appeal to this assemblage
of Democrats for the Invaluable assistance of
& wise Presidential nomination. The Demo
crats of Connecticut realize that, aside from
the great questions of public policy so ably
set forth In the platform just adopted, and
upon which any candidate selected by this
convention will squarely stand, the people of
this country are to pass upon the bizarre per
sonality and the political peculiarities of the
present chief executive. Thoughtful people
have begun to weary of his eccentric advertis
ing methede. They are alternately amused
and alarmed by his strenuous and untimely
Impetuosity. They decline to accept hrm"~In
his favorite role of a mighty military cap
tain. True, he has taken great pains to assure
them that he has charged up San Juan Hill,
but they have come to the conclusion that he
has shed more ink and Â¦ less blood than any
warrlor since Sancho Panza. They realize that
his chief hold upon a doubtful fame for mili
tary activity depends- upon euch glory as he
managed to achieve by impertinences and In
sults to Miles and Dewey and Schley. They
are uneasy in the knowledge that he is pain
fully lacking in poisa and balance, and so
constitutionally reckless that he is likely, at
any time, to involve our country in difficulties
at home and abrcad.
They have witnessed, with Infinite regret,
his efforts to stir up sectionalism and for sel
fish purposes to undo the work of patriots by
resurrecting the Infamous issue of the bloody
shirt. They have witnessed his burlesque as
saults upon the criminal monopolies and have
found that his warfare against the trusts
consists In the use of extravagant language
and the assumption \ of terrifying facial con
tortion*. They have come to know him be
cause of his extravagance, his arrogance, hi*
disregard for constitutional limitations and his
efforts to develop, the executive powers at the
expense of the legislative branch of the Gov
ernment. They are eager for a real Amer
ican statesman, of American size, and animated
by American constitutional ideas.
If you want to secure' the seven electoral
votes of Connecticut, if you wish to strengthen
and inspire her Democracy, if you desire to
heed the wishes of one of the doubtful States
that must be carried In order that the na
tional Democracy may come Into her own,
then you must name as the choice of this
great convention a candidate who appeals to
buth the regular Democrat ana the independent
voter, and who Is the very antithesis of the
Republican nominee.
Fortunately there is such a candidate now
before this assemblage for Its consideration.
Ho is a man of sound Democratic principles,
tried executive ability, great personal popu
larity, wide learning In the law. profound
respect for Justice and the constitution, un
doubted party regularity, a clean record and
a judicial reputation for dealing In a large
way with large problems. He Is a man of
dignity and self-control, and from his high
end honorable position upon the bench has
handed down leading decisions upon many
vexed and pertinent questions affecting labor
and capital. From his character, his attain
ments and his experience It is clear that both
the party and the country have in him a man
who can be trusted to meet every question as
It arises, to guide the affairs of state in a
safe and proper course, and at all times and
In every way to measure up to the highest
standard of public service. We can place
the Insignia of the party In his hands, secure
In the faith that he will carry It through
this contest even with the fidelity with which
the black Douglas carried the sacred casket
that contained the heart of Bruce.

feeble way been felt In this convention, and
that it has been strivinc.as earnestly as he
to defeat the nomination of Alton B. Parker
and to accomplish the nomination of ' quit*
another candidate.
Another objection Is that Judse Parker has
not taken upon himself the office of this con
vention to declare the will and purpose of ths
Democratic party. Mr. Chairman, I truÂ«t It
will be long before the Democratic party will
repeat the spectacle recently presented by its>
adversary of a great convention assembled to
merely record one man's oolnlon and to exe
cute one man's will. Sir, this convention has
assembled not to receive but to slve Instruc
tions to its nominee.
It may be, eir, that our candidate Is not
as voluble and vociferous as some would have
him be. but I have yet to learn that laryngeai
activity is the supreme test of statesmanship.
I have yet to learn that the length of a man's
mouth measures the depth of his wisdom.
When the Almighty wanted a leader to con
duct the children of Israel out of the house o"
bondage, Moses objected to his own selectlon_
on the ground that he lacked thÂ» gift cf ready
eloquence, and he suggested his brother Aaron
as a fit leader "nt the people. Aaron did not
have much judgment, but he could talk. But
the Almighty preferred the silent wisdom of
the great lawyer to the voluble unwisdom of
the sreat orator to lead the people In that cam
paign. And ,^ie did not forget Aaron, either.
He found a Dlace for him. And. Mr. Chair
man, while the Democratic party prefers its
Mosfs in this campaign, it wants the helD of
its Aaron, too.
Mr. Chairman, we enter this campaign under
such conditions as never before confronted 1 the
American people. Never before has the personal
character of the candidate been so important
to the country as this campaign. The Re
publican party, that was once proud to be
called the party of Lincoln, has become a
helpless slave to every caprice of one Irrespon
sible man. It has been eubdued to the law
less will of one man who b*Â«trldea It like a
colossus, while Its petty leaders In Congress
creep between his huge legs to find themselves
dishonorable graves. When could they say
till now that like talked-of Rome her wide
walls encompassed but onf man?
The will of this one man Is not directed by
wisdom and patriotism, but it Is characterized
ty an Impatience of all legal and constitutional
restraints, by desire to thrust his own militant
figure Into the foreground of every picture, by
a morbid craving for sensationalism and excite
ment.
The course of the present administration has
Justly alarmed all conservative citizens, who
feel that the peace as well as the prosperity of
the country demands the defeat of the present
occupant of the White House.
The Democracy of Tennessee has declared
that In this crisis the party should present a
candidate of judicial temper, one imbued with
a deep reverence for the constitution, with a
respect for law. with a Just regard for estab
lished precedents and traditions, with a sane
conception of the duties and responsibilities of
public office, a candidate, in short, whose whole
life and character will be In vivid contrast
with the recklessness, the lawlessness, the epi
leptic and convulsive strenuoslty of this admin
istration. We believe we have such a man in
the distinguished Jurist from New York. Tlje
fact that he has always supported the nomlate
of his party shows his fidelity to "the party or
ganization. The fact that he was elected by a
majority of 60.000 as a member of the highest
court In New York shows his popularity In that
Important State. His record on the bench dem
onstrates his (rreat ability. His action In cases
where the rights of labor and the power of un
lawful combinations were Involved shows that
he has never bowed to the power of wealth.
The fact that throughout a long official career
he has remained poor shows that he has never
been touched by greed for gain. His political
enemies testify to the purity of hia life and the
Incorruptible integrity of his character.
Choose this man for your leader and the
clans of Democracy will throng to his standard

The country called -upon New York for a
Democrat free from factional dispute, and
New York answers with a man friendly to
all factions, but a favorite and afraid of none;
a man who will take counsel and courage of
bothâ but who will take the bitterness of
neither â a man who will not stir the hatred
of the i>ast, nor share the acrimony of the
present, but who will lead us up toward the
future into a cloudless atmosphere of party
peace. The country called upon New York
for a man who measured up to the stature of
this lofty place, and New York answered with
a candidate who grew from - outh to man in
the humble walks cf life, who lived and
learned what all our common folk must live
and learn; a man who ripened with advancing
years in thf rich attainment of the law until
he went, by choice of those who knew him
best, to hold the even scale of Justice at the )
highest point of our great judicial system,
where with the masters who molded the State

with expanding vision the material growth and

The country called upon New York for a

a man who puts against executive usurpation

and balance of its three great powers; a man
who puts against the stealthy hunt* "with the

with a man whose path leads from the sweet

APPEALS TO COUNTRY.
With these as some of the claims upon your
corscience and judgment. New York comes
to you flushed with hope and pride. We ap
peal to the South, whose unclouded vision and
iron courage saw and fought the way for half
a century: wliose Jefferson awoke the dumb
defiance of development Into a voice that cried
cut to the world a curse upon thÂ» rule of kings
and a blessing upon a new-born republic;
whose Mauisoi: translated the logic of events
and the law of progress Into the constitution
of th* country: whose Jackson reclaimed the
lost places of the Far South and Democratized
the politics of the nation, and whose soldiers
rhewod the wNtdering world the finest fruits
of bm!n and nerve and hearts that ripen In
her temperate sun. and who through all the
sons she lost and all the sons she saved and
all the teare she shed amid the sorrowful
ruins of war â and through all the patient
i loyalty and labor of after years so wrought
for human happiness that nil the world ex-
claims "Her greatness in ' peace is greater
than her valor in war." We appeal to you
of the old South and the new to join with us
in" this, contest of the supremacy of our party.
We appeal to the West, .whose frontier strug
gles carried our civilization to the Pacific
Slope, whose courage I conquered the plain and
forest, whose faithful labor has built beautiful
cities, clenr through to the Rockies, we appeal
to you as hÂ« did Â¦ follow your leadership
through eight long years of controversy, you
turn and follow.' him now, when victory
awaits us. We appeal to New England's faith
ful sentiment among her historic hills, in the
name of all her unfaltering and brilliant
Democrats, living and dead, to join us In our
labor for success. We appeal to every Demo
crat from everywhere to forget the bitter war
fare of the past; forget the strife and anger
of the older other days: abandon all the
grudga and rancor of party discontent and, re.
calling with ever increasing pride the tri
umphs of our fifty years of constitutional
government, of liberty and peace â here and
now resolve to make the future record that
resplendent reach of time In which liberty
and peace went up and down the nations of
the earth, building their kingdom In the hearts
of men and gathering the harvest of genius
and toil; in which reason struck from the
hand of force the sword of hate and plucked
from the heart of war the germ of greed; In
which conscience emote thoughts of wrong
and tilled the mind with mercy's sweet re
straint: In which power grew in the human
breln, but refuse the shelter of a glittering
crown; In which the people of all lands and
tongues, awakened to hose by the Inspiration
of our example, followed with the march of
yenrs the - luminous pathway leading to a
destiny beyond the reach of vision and within
the province of God. In this spirit New York
nominates for President of the United States
Alton B. Parker. Â» v.
not. the point is. it is past. If we intend to
settle here the question as to who was right
and who was wron^ then we are foredoomed
to fall. For if we did not settle It then, how
can we succeed now? If you tell me I was
willinsr and I tell you we are willing, and if
Â»â¢Â» thresh it out that is the end. But if you
tell ir.e npht or wrong, we meet again after
a short, sharp separation at the Democratic
altar Â»nd that we must clasp hands In a
natural alliance of Democratic faith and find
fOTne common ground upon which we i-ach may
Ftand with honor, I say it does net matter who
was wrong. The point is. we are together
again. The tcience of sensible government is !
founded on compromise. The Integrity of party ;
existence rests unon the homely rule cf meet
ing each other half way.
STRATEGY XOT A SIX.
A platform is not a photograph of party
fetth â it is a eompot-ite sketch of party com
promise. A policy is an approximation, not
a precise iÂ»ian. It Is better to give up some
uiittmely doctrine and occasionally succeed
than to hold th?m all faithfully and always
fail, for if we could become master of a few
things we might become ruler over many.
To plan success in disregard of principle is
mere intrigue; to plan failure by holding to
an outlawed issue is mere folly. Winning is
not wicked; strategy is not a fin. It is far
better for the country to relight the fires o*
Democratic hope by success coming from con
cession than it Is to put out what is left by
failure fastened to a formula.
Gentlemen of the convention, we come to
gether in the historic valley of the Mississippi
at the time when united enemies ere making
patriotic pilgrimages io a shrine <>r<H-te.l hy
Democratic wisdom and foresight. Surely, as
you gather here, with the present breaking
upon your raptured vision and the '^sx filling
your heart with songs of _i<raisi"and joy;
surelv as you contemplate the commonwealth
filled with happy homes that stretch out in
bewildered sun to the southern seas and ro
call with unaffected pride that your party
gave this kingdom of wealth and courage to
the world's advancing reach: surely, here,
close to the quickened pulse of the great
southwestern giant* as he comes to strike
hands across the years with the spirit of the
eld dominion; here swept by the thrilling and
ennobling memories of the long ago, and in
spired by a spectacle which makes thesÂ« mem
ories dearer and nobler still, surely you are
urged by every impulse and entreated by
every recollection to forever sink the differ
ences that' d if- tract and the causes that con
fuse and. gathering afresh from this exhaust
less headwater of our hope the spirit of fifty
years of ascending party faith, resolve to re
store our party to its Place of power and
pride In the hearts and affections of our coun
trymen. -^^
NEW YORK IS UNITED. *
The State of New Tcrk. barkening to the
demand of every quarter of the country, comes
to you united upon one who will bring p^ace
into our council, patriotism and power into
our campaign and success to our contest. I
pay New York is united, and' in f-aying ao I
deny the charge that has been spread broad
cast over the country that there i3 dissension.
In the convention whose instructions we de
light to obey there were two resolutions of
fered, and each of these Invites the country to
consider the fitness and character of our can
didate. The first was correct, the Democrats
of New York favor the nomination for Pres
ident of the United States of that distin
guished Democrat and eminent jurist of our
cwn State â Alton Brooks P.irker, and the
delegates- selected by this convention are here
by instructed to present and support such nom
ination at the approaching national conven
tion: and said delegates are hereby further In
structed to vote and act as a unit In all mat
ters pertaining to said convention, in accord
ance with the will of the majority of said
delegates. And this wax adopted.
The other resolution was:
Realizing that the electoral votes of New
York are absolutely essential to Democratic
success, we submit to our brethren throughout
the country that Alton B. Parker, a Democrat
in the prime of life, has been elected by a
majority of over .CO.000 to the chief position
in the judicial system of the Ptate. and for
over six years haÂ« discharged the duties of
his high office with eueh unvarying dignity,
such ability and scrupulous fidelity, that if
his term were to 'Â¦xpire this year he would Â¦
undoubtedly be chosen to succeed himself by
the concurring vote of all his fellow citizens.
Therefore I repeat that this Is the unanimous
voice of New York inviting the country to
consider the fitness, ability and availability of

STOOD BEFORE KINGS.
In Ms solicitude for his fellow men, in his
anxiety for the - welfare of the whole people,
there Is profound affection for the human race
an undying devotion to those inctitutlons which
protect and shelter the weak and the poor
from cruelty, avarice and ambition.
Filial and fraternal, he pleads for hearth
and home and all the blessed ties of family
and friendship, and all the sacred sentiment**
and tender sympathies and exalted and reverent
virtues of domestic life. The hero of a hun
dred battle*, he emerges from a lifetime of
military service the nation's greatest cham
pion for peace. War has not blunted his sen
sibilities, perverted his sentiments or hardened
his heart, but it has developed in his great
heart pity and mercy, compassion and con
sideration.
Cicero has eald. "Grecian nations give the
honors of the gods to those men who have
ilsln tyrants," and shall we hesitate to crown
with the chaplt-t he has won him who slew
the dragons of the wilderness and conquered
th" demons of the desert?
Having pacified the plains he rose through
merit alone to the head of the army. To him
the armies of Spain surrendered. He liberated
Cuba and carried glad tidings of peace and
liberty to Porto Rico.
Having opened the desert to civilization,
with the eye of a prophet and the wisdom of a
? tst-fitian, he pointed out the way to remove
from Us parched and desolate face the old
despair and cause It to answer' the touch of
the tiller with glorious bloom, with ample
verdure and smiling plenty. While others were
dreaming and wondering, he told them how
Egypt, Assyria. Persia. India, China and
Japan sustained enormous populations by sci
entific and Judicious control of the natural sup
ply of water. And he has told us recently
that the- money squandered In mlagovernment
of so-called colon'^s would water all of our

At the close of the Civil War the whole
plain for" hundreds of miles east of the Rocky
Mountains was covered with hostile Indians,
marauding, murdering, torturing, carrying de
vastation and der^alr In all directions and
ni2king the settlement and development of that
region ImDOSsible. The man I present was
sent against them. With sleepless vigilance,
with tireless energy, with consummate strat
es>\ with relentless purpose, with fortitude
unsurpassed in the annals of time, with cour
age that faced death at even* step, on moun
tain wilds and through waterless wastes,
where men, famishing, did taste their own
blood to Quench the awful thirst; through
southern sands and northern snows; through
storms that rocked the earth and hid the
sky, he and. his men pursu-1 and overthrew
the fierce Cheyenne, the terrible Sioux and
the bloody Apache, driving their broken rem
nants beyond the boundaries of the United
States; hurling Sitting Bull Into British Amer
ica and Gerouimo into Mexico and capturing
him thÂ»nÂ». thus breaking forever the power
of the barbarian, clearing the plains of the
cruel, implacable. . beleaguering savage and

upon his shoulders were called down from the
fkles by the magnetism of his sword," and
the great Grant bag declared in his memoirs
that this boyish chieftain was equal to the
part performed by himself.
A citizen 'warrior, he proved a hero, against
whose stem, unyielding front of steel and
flame the flower of a foe as brave as ever
bore arms was hurled, again and again, in
vain. Wounded at Fair Oaks, severely
wounded at Fredericksburg, desperately and
apparently mortally wounded at Chancellors

crimson laurels thick upon him. he survived
1} flght on Mill more bloody fields and to re

Sprung from that nursery of American no
bility, the American farm; descended from a
long line of devoted and heroic patriots; born
to an inheritance of lofty chivalry, at his
country's call he bounded to the battleflsld, a
flaming young Hercules.
Without a regular military education, at
first rejected as too young to be a captain.
In three years thereafter he was a major gen

will lead to no International disputes or for

HIS PERSONAL FITNTESS.
I do not need to tell of the personal fitnej>Â»
of Georc* Gray for the great offlc* of Presi
dent. Tou know it. The country knows it. He
has lived in th* white light of publicity for
twenty years. His public services have bten
dlMlTigutehd and known to all men.
Four fourteen years he was in the Senate,
elected t>y Delaware, but serving the whole
TTnited States. That srrvice was the steady,
cairn, convincing service of a Icfty patriot
and true Democrat. With an intellect of the
first order, guided by a Judgment calm and
rur<*-toou-d, he won the admiration and confi
dence of our country.
He served on the commission which made
p*are with Spain, and we all know now that
It would have been well with our country
if his patriotic advice onn<-ernlng the terms
of that treatyâ so earnestly and eloquently
â¢urredâ ha<1 been heeded ty the Government
T'pon the bench. Judge Gray, as lawyers
know, ha* taken rank eijual to any of " the
illustrious men who adorn the Federal iudl
clary.
Whn rhall measure the service hi* rendered

PRIVATE LIFE PURE.
His neighbors know him even better than
the country, and among them there is but
fne voice. His private life is as pure as a
spring on the mountain side, with clear. gush-
Ing water frcm the living rock. With cour
age as keen as the Damascus blade, with
heart of pure gold, with life dedicated to
the public good, power cannot overawe him
nor wealth corrupt him. Trained and sea
soned by experience and service in lofty pub
lic station, yet In the full vigor and power of
magnificent manhood, he stands ready to your
hand to make a great and moderate Presi
dent.
With all his other qualities to win approval,
he nan the winning trait of society. Ht is
not ambltous. He does not seek or desre
the Presidency. He would prefer others to
himself. We name him here as a candidate
for President not because he longs for the
place or desires to wield itsi mighty power,
but because Democracy needs him and the
country needs him.
George Gray is a man entwined with vic
tory. Inscribe that name upon your ban
ners and faction will hush, dissension cease.
Hit* nomination here means your triumph in
November.
Delaware, small in size, has been called
the Diamond State. We know not why unless
it be in cvmpliment to the manhood of some
of the public men who have adorned and
bejeweled her history- We offer you, to be
set In the glorious crown of Democracy, a
diamond of purest ray. flashing in every direc
tion the precious creed of equal rights. He Is
a cut and polished stone without a flaw. Where
can you find one of equal weight and bril
liancy? We offer in every truth a man of
dauntless courage, faultless patriotism and un
compromising Democracy.

It has been Bald, and truly said, that no
campaign ever decides more than one Issue.
Wliat. then. Is the Issue which divides to-day
the Democratic and Republican parties? What
Is the fundamental principle upon which they
are In antagonism? What is the essential
thing which Democracy stands for and which
Republicanism antagonizes? Is It a question
of tariffs or of tariff revision? A question
of standards of money? A question of regu
lating the currency or controlling the banks?
A question of expansion or of Imperialism?
So. Important as those are the question is
greater than any or all of these. It includes
thtm all. it Is true, but It Includes much more.
It Is a question which touches the very foun
drtions of our Institutions and strikes at the
very existence of our government. Let euphe
mistic babblers gloss over as they may; let
trimmers who shift their sail to every political
breeze that blows evade it as they can; let
time servers who usurp the name of Dem
ocracy sneer at It as they will, still the ques
tion which confronts the American people to
day â which has confronted them with ever
growing inrlHtence since the Civil War â Is
whether this Government shall be carried on
for the benefit of the people and of the whole
people or whether it shall be manipulated for
thei benefit of a privileged class â whether Its
great departments, executive and judicial, shall
be perpetuated for the protection of the equal
rights of all or whether they shall be per-

Gentlemen of the convention, if this is not
the paramount Issue of this campaign, what

question upon which the two parties differ, in
what do they differ? If the Republican party

money power, for what does it stand? *And if
the Democratic party does not represent the

Unswerving In his devotion to these prin

people to-day. And as surely as, in spite of
the opposition of the monarchical followers of
Hamilton, as surely as. In spite of the enmity

fathers of old consecrated their Uves upon the

in Nomination as an Ideal
Democratic Standard-
Bearer.
SAYS THAT JUDGE GRAY
IS A GREAT MAN FROM
A VERY LITTLE STATE
Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen of the Convention:
We are here to-day : to present to. the country
a winning issue and a winning candidate. The
dcrr.lnant issue In this campaign is the same
issue that has - been dominant In every cam
paign In history- It is an issue that Involves
all other Issues and is as old as creation itself;
an issue that formed the first plank in the
first platform of the Almighty when he said,
"By the- sweat of thy face shall thou eat
bread"; and that issue was reaffirmed at a
later period when Â¦ he said. "Six days f halt
thou labor and do all thy work": an Issue
that had for its first champion no less a
leader than the great and tender Christ, who
said. "The . laborer Is worthy of his hire." â¢
The man who deserves the nomination of
this convention knows that .a laborer Is some
thing more than the minion of a money mag
nate, who fattens on his brawn; something
mere than a retainer for the trust baron who
lives in a castle built by the exactions of a
robber tariff; something more than the lackey
ot some lord of lucre whose slightest wish Is
law and whose command becomes the sentence
of t)Â»e. highest court; something more than
an Industrie 1 peon who must submit .to rob
bery perpetually without protection, envying
the thief who picks bis pocket most artistically

Relnhart of- Iowa seconded W. R.
Hearst's nomination. He said:

? RE1NHART QUOTES BIBLE.
The Democracy of Florida desire the nomi
nation of Hearst because the paramount Issue
to-day Is the trust question, and William R.
Hearst is the most persistent and aggressive
opponent of the trusts and all of the hardships
and evils attendant upon their unrestrained
oppressions of the people. The Democracy of
Florida desire the nomination of Hearst be
cause we believe that he Is the only man who
can carry Into the Democratic column the
rlvotal States of New York and Illinois and
which are essential to Democratic success, and
Democratic success only <ran rescue the South
from the degradation of RooseveltlFm and ne
grolsm. We know that there are distinguished
gentlemen here from the State of New York
who loudly proclaim that Judge Parker alone
amons all of tho candidates can carry New
ly ork. It la wovthy of the consideration of
this convention that the leaders of thU
coterie are the very gentlemen who In IS!):!
as vigorously protested at Chicago against the
nomination of Cleveland and who as confi
dently predicted that the nomination of Cleve
land meant the loss of the State of New York
to - the Democratic party. We believe that
these gentlemen are as badly mistaken to-day
in their assertion that Parker and Parker
alone can carry New York as they were in
18!>2 in their prediction that Cleveland could
not. We twlleve that Hearst can and will
carry New York if this convention makes him
the standard bearer of the Democratic party.
ST. LOUIS. July 8. â John S. Beard
of Florida, in behalf of himself and
four delegates, 'seconded the nomina
tion of W. R. Hearst. He said:
Gentlemen of the Convention: In tiie name
of four delegates from the State of Florida,
who in my Judgment represent the overwhelm
ing Democratic sentiment of my State, I sec
ond the nomination of William Randolph
Hearst.

BEARD SECONDS HEARST.
ST. LOUIS. July 8.â Great uncertain
ty still exists concerning the Vice
Presidential nomination. The same
candidates who have heretofore keen
mentioned are still mentioned, and
some are being pushed with a great
deal of earnestness. No one man has
been yet singled out by the leaders and
large delegations to be supported for
the second place. There seems to be
a desire to select a man from Illinois,
Indiana or Ohio, if possible.
The Western men have secured quite
a large number of delegations to sup
port former Senator George Turner of
Washington.
UNCERTAINTY EXISTS.
The empire State of the South, Mr. Chair

son of the empire State of tbe North and
prophesies victory In November with Alton B.
Parker u tbe standard bearec
Across the continent, from the woods of
Maine to the peach-covered hills of Georgia,
where the ripening Elbertas are being kissed
into golden color by the sunlight, there is a
trusting confidence of a people confidently
awaiting the tidings of Judge Parker's nom
ination. /Â¦
Let us meet In a spirit of fraternity and
carry out the will of the people.
Let us plead again in favor of the I Demo
cratic party In which we have planted our
faith.
Let us remember to-day that we are gath
ered together to carry out the will of the
people; that their voice Is sovereign; that
they are the final tribunal. What is the will
of the people? Certainly if the delegates
ever knew the man whom the file and rank
of the Democratic party wanted them to nom
inate they know to-day. No organized move
ment was ever behind a candidacy of Judge
Parker. The people, having learned of him,
trusted him and felt an unbounded confidence
in him. Â¦ .
No man can doubt that the vast majority
of the people will turn from the restlessness
and uncertainty of the present administration
toward Alton B. Parker with a feeling of
restfulness and hope.
PARKER, INSPIRES HOPE.
This instructed Georgia delegation was the
beginning of the tidal wave which has swept
the States and Insures to-day the nomination
of the (treat New Yorker.
Georgia Is rlad to-day to second the nom
ination of one whose strength of character and
simplicity of life have endeared him to the
American people. A learned Jurist who
glories In the recreation of his rural home,
where on his farm he finds delight tn honest
pursuits followed by the great mass of the
American people; 'a man whose name has be
come the synomym of victory; one whom the
people have tried and approved, whose honesty,
ability and statesmanship have stood the test,
and who Â«eems to meet the emergency of the
hour to fill all the requirements ot an ideal
leader of a great party.
We found such a leader. Georgia claims tfre
honor. The Empire State of the North, with
her favorite son. shall reap the fruit of this
convention, but It was th? county of Lincoln.
In the State of Georgia, which first 'instructed
a delegate to vote 'first, last and all the time
for Alton B. Parker of New York.
Realizing the bright prospects of victory in
10O4, the South began early solution of the
problems of selecting the strongest leader for
Democracy's standard bearer. We believe that
we have selected wisely and well. We looked
for a leader with a clean life, possessed of a
wife conservatism and a broad statesmanship;
one who stood by Democracy in sunshine and
shadow; was equally loyal to the party In
stormy hours of defeat and in the brighter
days of victory.
PROSPECTS OF VICTORY.
ST. LOUIS. July 8. â Moses Wright
of Georgia, in seconding the P&rker
nomination, spoke as follows:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: It was claimed In a. recent national con
vention that Georgia blood coursed in the veins
of the nominee of the Republican party. This
may be true, but with Georgians Democracy is
thicker than blood. We bring to you to-day
the message that from among the old red hills
of Georgia there will come later tidings of
Democratic victory for 19(H surpassing all the
glorious achievements of the past.
In striking contrast with the solemn occa
sion when our Republican friends met and
"stood pat" is the genuine enthusiasm of this
great gathering. The spirit which gives birth
to this enthusiasm Is the spirit of victory.
The emiles of contentment which we wear to-day
arc in contemplation of the political harvest
which we expect to reap in the fall. As for
our Republican friends, the frost seemed to
fall In the early summer convention, and their
prophecies were blighted ere the autumn hours.
We shall demonstrate to those who have pre
dicted discord that ours will be a united party
Joined In harmonious flght against the enemy
We shall present to the American people a
platform which declares the will of the party
fearlessly and with no uncertainty; which bold
ly attacks the injustice and unfairness of the
Republican policy and offers a remedy therefor.
The platform we offer strikes a death blow to
the unlawful trusts and to the unjust tariff
which fosters and protects them.
We go to the people with a policy which
knows no discrimination. North, South: East
or. West, but is tender In Its consideration of
the rights of every section under the American
flag.
Moses Wright Says the South Wants
Parker for President,
THICKER THAN BLOOD.
PHILADELPHIA. July S.â The Pub
lic Ledger to-morrow will publish the
following (Jispatch under an Esopus,
N. Y., date:
"In conversation with a visitor to
day Judge Parker Intimated that in
certain contingencies he migrht an
nounce himself as differing fi-om thÂ»
platform of his party."
This intimation assumes considerable
importance in view of the action taken
at St. Louis on the gold plank as at
first proposed. It probably means that
Parker in his letter of acceptance xvill
seek to remove the failure of the con
vention to venture a declaration on
this important subject.
Judge Parker's expression, though
somewhat guarded, left no room for
doubt that he had some particular mat
ter in mind and that he fully felt thÂ«5
necessity of clearly defining before the
people the cause which he is to repre
sent as a candidate at the polls.
MAY XOT AGREE.
In tbe name of the Issue of human rights
which was first spoken Into being by the
omnipotent flat of Jehovah, and In behalf of
the millions of the people in this country who
earn their bread by the sweat of their faces.
I second the nomination of a man who em
bodies all the potentialities that make a great
champion of the people â a faithful and efficient
servant of the average man. I second the
nomination of a man great enough to know
the Issue and courageous enough to meet It;
a man who for twenty years has fought the
Koori fight and kept the faith; who has been
in the forefront of every battle for humanity;
who has endured the hottest fire of the enemy
without flinching, and from whom all the
poisoned shafts of malicious envy and malig
nant calumny have glanced harmlessly because
he wears the armor of eternal right. I second
the nomination of William Randolph Hearst.
and voting him Into office as a reward for
his deft touch. He will have more regard
for the thousand girls who toll in a factory
than he has for the owner of the factory who
lives in a palace and negotiates a decayed
foreign title In exchange for the virtue of his
daughter.
A man whose personality and whose career
will arrest the attention and challenge the ad
miration of the people. If we nominate an
unknown or prosaic candidate, titled medioc
rity and counterfeit greatness will continue to
call' forth the applause of the multitude;
The man who fills In full measure the re
quirements of the hour Is General Nelson A.
Miles. It nominated he will be the candidate
of no faction, but of the -whole Democratic
party and all patriots.. He will receive the
vote of every Democrat In the United States.
He will receive the independent vote, the antl
lmperiallst peace vote and tbe good citizen
vote. He will receive the votes of all those
(and they are legion) who resent the attempt
of the acting President, to degrade and dis
honor him, and to degrade and dishonor other
illustrious men who have earned the praise
and lasting gratitude of their countrymen.
His name will warm the hearts and stir the
blood of every comrade of the Civil War
They will recognize In his candidacy their last
opportunity to vote for on? of their own for
the great office of President. His candidacy
will arouse" the. generous, chlvalrlc spirit of
â¢very man wbo wore tbe gray. Wltb sucb a
CANDIDATE OF NO FACTION.
He believes' that we should have a navy
sufficient tc defend our extensive coasts and
protect the rights of our people and our coun
try tverywhÂ«re: but he believes also that upon
every ship should be written "Millions for de
fense, but net one cent for conquest." He be
lkves In the economic doctrines of the Demo
cratic â¢ party. He believes that there should
be no tax except for a public purpose. He
believes that the Industry and substance of
the people should not be exploited by criminal
combinations; that the law against conspiracies
in restraint of trade should be enforced and
that offenders should be punished. He be
lieves that labor is the base of the social
system; that the base cannot be despised;
that the laborers and producers are the salt
oC the earth, that their broad shoulders and
strong arms support the whole fabric of civ
ilization, that they constitute the great body
of the people and must never be enslaved.
That property has rights also, but that the
maintenance of those rights does not require
that a limited and constantly diminishing num
ber of persons shall be permitted to monopolize
all of the property of the country; Or that a
pampered banditti shall be permitted to defy
the laws, absorb all wealth and enslave the
people.
He believes, with the Immortal Washington,
that the mission of the republic Is peace,
justice and liberty. That we must teach peace
by being peaceful, and we must teach justice
by being Just; that we must teach liberty by
maintaining our own liberties and by never
denying liberty to any people. He believes
that this nation has been a world power from
its birth, that It was a world power when that
old bell rang out from Independence Hall,"
liberty throughout the land and to all the
inhabitants thereof. That It was a world
power when by the force of Its example It
caused republics to take the place of mon
archies in all South America. Central Amer
ica and Mexico. . That It was a world power
when by the force of Its- example it caused the
great French revolution, shattered absolutism
and gave to i continental Europe, except Rus
sia, constitutional government. That It was
a world power when It Inspired Japan, glorious
Japan, to cast away the cruel bauble of au
tocracy and adopt a free constitution, based
upon the principles of democracy. That for
more than a hundred years It has been such
a great world power. Its light has so shown
in the world that it has attracted to these
shores the oppressed of all nations, drawn to
this country by the Justice of its taws and
the magnanimity of its character. But It has
not been an imperial world power, and only
the enemies of liberty would have It so.' It
has been a democratic power, a republican
world power; the mother of republics, the
fountain of democracy and the home of "lib
erty .enlightening the world." Our candidate
must be a man against whom no faction will
v,age war; he must be a man whose eminence,
experience and ability are a guarantee of his
fitness for the Presidency.

Born and reared In the' East, his long serv

A born Democrat, he'is In full sympathy* with

He believes that there can be no Just taxa

the ticket would make an epoch In our his
tory. United In their wider comradeship of
American valor, now the proud heritage of
the whole American people, the survivors of
that great struggle, both North and South,
would rally â¢ to the Democratic standard al
most to a man. The one man whom the Repub
licans fear Is Miles. The one' man' whom the
White House fears Is Miles. They fear him
because the envious shaft aimed at his heart
by the acting President fell harmless at his
feet, and they fear Its rebound If he la nomi
nated. They fear him because of his record,
because of his personality, because the splen
dor of his career and the grandeur of his char
acter would so outshine the acting President
as to. pale his boasted, exploits into utter in

the South. Miles can , carry not Â» Only New

the mountain States. He can carry Nebraska
and he can carry Kansas.
The people want for their President a man
clean-hearted and hlgh-souled; a man upright
and honest of purpose, with ability of high
order. -They don't want -a madman. They
don't want a wild man. They don't want a
man possessed of illusions or possessed by il
lusions. They don't want a man whose vault-
Ing ambition would burst all bounds and sun
der all restraints and plunge the nation into
needless dangers and inflict upon the people
needless sufferings and sacrifices.
They want a man whom they can love and
trust and admire for his manhood, for his
Judgment, for his humanity, for. his Integrity,
for his stainless life, for his preat career, for
his kind heart, for his sound head, for his
democratic Instincts and for his love of liberty.
A man who will restore the constitution, re
vive the old veracity, enforce the laws, re-es
tablish justice, Kf>vpr the head of monopoly and
privilege and break the chain and set the
captive free and proclaim onee more. "Peace,
commerce and honest friendship with all na

I nominate for President that peerless pa

incorruptible, that Illustrious citizen. General
Nelson A. Miles.
The speaker worked himself into a
high pitch of excitement as with white
lace and ringing voice he drew a nie-
He passed on to the color question
and declared that when the black or
yellow races came into contact with
white people, if that race would not
commit suicide, it must remain abso
lutely distinct. A shout from the
Southern delegations greeted this. He
declared that Booker T. Washington
would outlive his undoubted useful
ness if he did not cease to heed the
teaihings of the Republican party.
He urged the men of the West and
North to refrain from oppressing the
South by advocating anything that
tended to obliterate the racial lines. He
deprecated the fact in the Republican
convention that one man had risen to
speak against the plank in that party's
platform which urged a reduction of
Southern representation in Congress
because of alleged disfranchlsement of
voters in the South.
Hobson accepted the invitation and
made his way from the Alabama dele
gation to the platform. He was greet
ed with a round of applause and the
usual cries of "louder" when he had
uttered but a few words. He compiled
promptly with the request and reveal
ed the best and strongest voice that
has been heard in the convention.
"What President has been brave
enough to enforce the law against the
labor union violator of law?" It was
a Democratic President, he said, and
applause greeted the assertion.
By 11 o'clock the torrid temperature
in the hall moderated materially, the
result being due to a heavy rainstorm
that passed over the city. The relief,
while not great,- was sufficient to add
decidedly to the comfort of the crowd
that packed the hall. t
When the roll call was finished,
Chairman Clark, who was displaying
decided ability in keeping up the in
terest of the convention during the
tedious wait for word of some kind
from the committee on resolutions,
called on the band to play "America."
His wishes were carried out. the en
tire convention rising and singing two
stanzas of the song. A motion was
made and carried out that Richmond
Pearson Hobson of Alabama be in
vited to address the convention.
HOBSON* TAKES PLATFORM.
"The clerk will call the roll," said
the chairman, "for the list of honorary
vice presidents," and the calling of the
roll, designed more for the purpose of
keeping the convention quiet by giving
something to do, proceeded with de
liberation.
Delegate J. C. Shepard of South
Carolina created a wild shout by de
claring that the convention wanted
to hear Bourke Cockran speak.
Â¦ After quiet had been restored it was
stated that Cockran was not in the
hall. A demand for C. A. Towne, "the
silver-tongued orator," was made, but
Towne declined to respond.
In the anxiety to learn when the
committee on resolutions would be
ready to report the list of national
committeemen had not been confirmed
and the oversight was remedied by a
motion which was carried by a viva
voce vote and th procedure straight
ened out.
The Pennsylvania delegation arose
and saluted the announcement of J.
M. Guffey as their national committee
man.
A call for the committee to meet at
the Jefferson Hotel as soon as the
convention adjourns sine die was
made.
Another call was made for the re
port of the committee on resolutions.
As the call did n6t bring any result,
the secretaries of the convention be
gan to work the telephone vigorously
in an effort to put the chairman of the
convention in touch with the chair
man of the committee, in order to find
out when he would be ready with his
report.
BOURKE COCKRAN" WANTED.:
Representative Ollie James of Ken
tucky moved that ' a committee be
appointed -by the chair to -wait on
the committee and ascertain when it
would be ready to report. This mo
tion received a second, and was car
ried without delay. Chairman Clark
named James H. Clayton of Alabama
and T. H. Ball of Texas as the commit
tee.
The delegates and spectators at once
arose and stood during" the convoca
tion. *
At the conclusion of the prayer an
announcement was made at the order
of Chairman Clark that he was de
termined to have order, and "that any
person raising a row will be taken
out by the police."
A demand was made for a report of
the resolutions committee. As no re
port was forthcoming it was determ
ined to call the roll of the States for
the purpose of having the names of
the next national committee an
nounced. There were cheers at the
announcement of the name of Robert
D. Sullivan as committeeman of Illi
nois, but the demonstration assumed
still larger proportions at the mention
of Thomas Taggart of Indiana, which
followed.
of the unreadiness of that committee
to appear with its Important document
and the waiting continued.
At 10:48 a. m. Chairman Clark
arose and let fall his huge gavel. The
clerk picked up a megaphone and
announced that the session would
begin with prayer by Rabbi Samuel
Sate of St. Louis.
Great applause and cheers greeted
this statement, and as soon as James
could be heard again he continued:
"New York, Nebraska, Virginia and
Wisconsin have all Joined hands, and
will bring in a platform that will carry
us to a glorious victory in November."
Again the convention voiced its pleas
ure at the news and a mighty shout
went up.
James followed his last announce
ment at once with a motion to adjourn
until 8 o'clock to-night. A second was
at once heard and the motion was car
ried, the session closing at 11:53 o'clock.
"Your committee appointed to wait
upon the resolutions committee report
that they have discharged that duty.
The committee inform us that they will
be unable to report to this convention
until 8 o'clock to-night, at which time
they will bring in a unanimous report,
signed by every member of the com
mittee."
The committee, headed by Repre
sentative Ollie James, which had been
dispatched to the rooms of the resolu
tions committee presented its report,
and James was introduced amid ap
plause. His announcement was:
The speaker finished and the band,
following him close up, played "The
Star-Spangled Banner" and then swung
into "Dixie," which received more than
the usual tribute.

A CUBE & *Â» I2OCH*sprang up and waved a Hearst banner
over the discomfited New Yorkers. A
battle of fists seemed Imminent and tha
police were called upon to drive tha
warring factions to their seats. It was
several minutes before they succeeded
in clearing the aisles and stopping
what threatened to develop into a seri
ous combat. #
During the mad demonstration a
huge Hearst banner waa carried to the
platform by the Californlans. Instead
of "Hearst for President" the gifted
sign painter that executed it had
branded it "Hearst for Progress." The
banner soon came down and there were
but few that noted the error.
When the New York standard was
torn from its fastening and used to
mark the advance of the Parker hosts
the first to wave in its wake was that
of Texas. Then came Oklahoma and
Indian Territory. Alaska and Utah.
James U. Budd for Vice Pr&ident
will be the cry of the Californlans in
the convention to-morrow if the voice
of M. F. Tarpey does not prevail. The
south of Tehachapl delegates were
busy to-night seeking votes for Budd.
They do not expect to nominate him.
but they hope to make the compliment
ary vote a big one.
Without apparent purpose the Call
fornlans extended the whoop-up long
after every one else was ready to quit.
They wanted to go on record as making
more noise than the Parkerites, and
they.succeeded.
The demonstration was a splendid
climax to the effort of Delmas. The
polished rhetoric and studied diction
of the distinguished lawyer was lost,
however, in the great Coliseum. The
delegates heard Delmas and noted well
his points, but the audience, the Cali
fornians in particular, were disap-
HEADQUARTERS CALIFORNIA
DELEGATION. JEFFERSON HOTEL,
ST. LOUIS, July 8.â Delirious with de
light, California's delegation roared
and howled and whooped for Hearst a
full half hour to-night. D. M. Delmas
had concluded his speech placing
Hearst in nomination when the Cali
fornians, Joseph Simmons leading and
waving the Democratic standard of
the State, started the demonstration
for the aspiring editor. In the wake of
the Californlans marched bearers of
placards on which were printed the
names of Iowa, Wyoming, Nevada,
Arizona, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Illi
nois, Washington, Minnesota, Kansas,
South Dakota and New Mexico.

Polished Rhetoric and Studied Diction of Distinguished

CALIFORNIANS START AN EXTENDED
DEMONSTRATION FOR HEARST AT THE
CONCLUSION OF THE DELMAS SPEECH
Rhinehart denied for himself and all
others of the Iowa delegation that any
money had been received by them to
induce them to cast their votes for any
candidate.
Before Rhinehart had concluded the
convention showed signs of restless
ness, but a yell greeted his last words.
There was soon a sequel to the
Wright incident. The delegation held
a meeting and voted to unseat Wright
as the Iowa member of the committee
to notify the Presidential nominee. In
the words of one of the delegates, the
action was taken because of the "im
putations cast upon the delegation" by
Wright
Kansas was called and J. G. Johnson
was recognized to second the Hearst
nomination. Johnson said in part:
"We believe in the theoretical policy
that the office should seek the man, but
we also believe in the practical political
proposition that the man should be out
in plain sight when the office is looking
for him; that he should take the people
into his confidence and give them every
means of knowing what he stands for
and what they can depend upon if they
elect him. And for this reason we de
fend the nomination of Mr, Hearst."
PRESENTS MILES' NAME.
As Johnson concluded the chair
recognized David Overmeyer of Kan
sas, who placed General Nelson A.
Miles in nomination.
Vigorous applause followed Over
meyer's mention of his candidate and
he was frequently interrupted by the
galleries, and the applause at the con
clusion of his remarks was short-lived.
In the midst of the handclapping the
chairman's gavel fell sharply and end
ed it.
Delegate Roesing of Minnesota then
interposed a motion that all seconding
speeches should be limited to one min
ute.
Governor Dockery moved to amend
by making the time five minutes. After
a little parliamentary squabble the time
was fixed at four minutes.
Kansas produced a third speaker In
J. W. Orr. who. In a few words not
heard far from his seat, seconded the
nomination of Parker.
Thomas H. Ball of- Texas was
next recognized to second the nomina
tion of Parker. Louisiana also sec
onded Parker.
Maine gave way to Missouri and
Champ Clark of that State took the
platform to place In nomination Sena
tor Francis M. Cockrell of Missouri
for the Presidency.
It was after 1 o'clock when Clark
began to speak.
CLARK AROUSES DELEGATES.
His audience had sat for more than
five hours in the sweltering heat of the
packed hall and listened to speeches
for the greater part prepared in ad
vance. They were growing tired.
But Clark was a stimulant. He had
not spoken a hundred words before a
ripple of rearoused attention ran
through the hall. It was much like
the scene at Chicago when Speaker
Cannon spoke. In five minutes he had
won his audience and weariness was
swept from them. They responded to
his every hit and cheered him to the
echo.
. Clark's first mention of his candi
date as "old Cockrell" threw the con
vention Into convulsions of laughter.
The band played "Dixie" and the trib
ute rose to a demonstration. It was
Missouri cheering Missouri's favorite
son and the whole convention joined in
the compliment.
Bundles of flags ' were carried
around to the galleries and thousands
of them were moved over Into Missou
ri territory and in an instant two pic
tures of Senator Cockrell were ripped
from their frames while the gallery
danced and shrieked in delight.
Above the band and the cheers ris
ing high and clear as a bugle call
suddenly came the shrill and pierc
ing "rebel yell" and the long drawn
"Wah-Hoo-oo" of the plains.
The Missouri delegation went on a
short march around the . hall. The
tribute to Senator Cockrell, which was
one of the handsomest things of its
kind seen in many conventions, lasted
more than a quarter of an hour.
CHEERS FOR OLNEY.
Kansas sought to make a counter
demonstration by waving two pictures
of Hearst, but the Missourlans were
not to be denied and this time they
"showed" things to the other side.
When twenty minutes had gone a Mis
souri delegate carried me State em
blem to the platform and waved it as
high in the air as he could reach.
This was the end of the demonstra
tion, however, and quiet was restored.
Maryland seconded the nomination
of Parker through Colonel Benjamin
jSchley.
"Massachusetts," called the clerk and
Patrick A. Collins of Boston made his
way to the platform to nominate Rich
ard OIney.
The mention of Olney called forth
cheers, led by Massachusetts.
There was another loud cheer when
the speaker declared that Olney need
ed no introduction to . the world and
when he closed there . were cheers and
calls for Olney. After the Olney
demonstration there was a call for
three cheers for Cockrell and they were
given with a will.
When the name of Minnesota was
called the chairman of that delegation,
on behalf of a portion of the delega
tion, seconded the nomination of
Parker.
another member of the delegation was
the platform," said Rhinehart, "cast
aspersions on the delegates from Iowa.
I desire to cast the aspersions back into
his teeth."
DENIES RECEIVING MONEY.
v Chairman Weaver of the Iowa dele
gation loudly demanded a hearing but
was not recognized. He asserted that
his colleagues wished to remove Wright
as the honorary vice president of the
convention from Iowa. Then Chair
man Bailey took a hand.
Rapping his desk he secured order
and said:
"In the confusion the "chair was un
able to recognize the gentleman who
rose first. In order to correct the mis
take the chair now takes great pleas
ure in recognizing Rhinehart of Iowa."
"The gentleman who has just left
At 12:28 a. m. Kern concluded and
the State of Iowa was called. A dele
gate sprang to his chair and declared
a second to Hearst. But Sam Wright
of TIpton, Iowa, mounted his chair and
Ehouted:
"On behalf of the unbought, unpur
chasable delegates of Iowa "
At this point a rush was made for
Wright by some of his colleagues in
the delegation. It became evident at
once that trouble was on. Wright
sprang forward on the chairs to get
out of the reach of his antagonists. An
Arkansas delegate across the aisle
reached out his hand and motioned
him in. The convention was thrown
into an uproar. One of the Hearst
Iowa delegates rushed forward to the
platform. He was at once followed by
Wright between two men. There was
a whispered conference with Chairman
Bailey, and Wright secured recogni
tion.
He thundered forth, "Gentlemen of
the conventionâ I am proud of the fact
that the great party to which I belong
ordinarily believes in free speech."
This struck the convention and
Wright was accorded attention.
"On behalf of that section of Iowa
which sends Democrats to Congress,
on behalf of Iowa Democrats who did
not receive their political education
from Coin's financial school, I second
the nomination of Judge Parker of
New York."
Wright at once left the platform
amid great applause and confusion.
He proceeded down the aisle to his
seat. His colleagues, however, refused
to allow him to take his seat. He was
called many hard names and finally
had to be protected by an officer and
was given a seat by the Georgia dele
gation. The incident was one of the
liveliest of the session and for a mo
ment promised to become sensational.
DISTURBANCE IS STARTED.
PAYS TRIBUTE TO PARKER.
Indiana was called next, and John W.
Kern responded to second the nomina
tion of Judge Parker. Kern said in
part:
"When our candidate takes posses
sion of the White House on March 4
how comforting and reassuring to the
American people to have even a brief
period of silence after the never-ending
streams of talk poured from those pre
cincts during the past three years â talk
of war, talk of wildcats, talk of bear
fights, of fencing, of boating, of ath
letic _ contests, of babies; after all the
startling performances of the present
executive, from Panama diplomacy,
from breakfast table chats with the
colored man and brother. How blissful;
oh, how restful and reposeful will be
the sllence^ â at least the comparative si
lence which will surely come!
"The candidate soon to be named by
this convention Is able, honest, fear
less, a friend of the people, a foe of
lawless monopoly, an upholder of the
constitution, a defender of the princi
ples of Jefferson, a thoroughbred Dem
ocrat and a never-falling winner. His
name is already upon your lips. You
are only awaiting the opportunity to
nominate himâ Alton Brook Parker of
New York."
lshed Filipinos, from the bullpens of
Colorado, from the homes of jailed
workmen denied trial by jury, from
the overworked and underpaid, the eyes
of the poor and oppressed are turned
to us. They ask for a candidate who
is their friend, for a man devoted, to
their cause.
"The hopes and aspirations of these
toilers are centered on William R.
Hearst. These millions believe in him
because, for the first time in the his
tory of America, they have found a
man of wealth, of industry and power
who has turned his back upon the
tawdry praise of the world and pleaded
their cause. They are for him, because
In his great journals, for the first time
in the history of the world, the cause,
of the weak and depressed has found
voice and tongue.
"If this convention would gain the
votes of the common people of the
United States, that great class without
whom there never was a Democratic
party, they must name a man who has
fought the battles of the poor. With
such a man the mighty hosts of work
ers from the fields and prairies, from
the factories and mills, from the rail
ways and the mines, those who produce
what other men consume, who make
things while exploiters are printing
stocks and bonds, these men under the
banner of true Democracy will bring
us a victory that will be a victory in
deed.
"It may be that the hour of reason
and judgment has passed by, that this
Democratic convention will be unmind
ful to the call of the humble and the
weak: but the time when the fever of
commercialism shall have run its
course, when humanity and Justice
shall once more control the minds of
men, this great party will come back
from the golden idols and the tempting
fleshpots and once more battle for the
rights of man."
Darrow concluded at 12:18 o'clock.
Fully a dozen times the line com
pleted the circuit, and then the Cal
ifornia banner waa carried up to the
speakers' platform, and the other
States massed their emblems at the
foot of the steps, the men who bore
the emblems cheering and waving
them with great energy.
A you!hg woman wearing a gown of
whit*, with a broad blue ribbon across
her breast and a blue girdle about her
waist, rose in section "O" and waved
a small flag. She brought to her side
fifty other people who Joined in her
tribute, and for a time she was the
heart of the storm center. When she
Eat down the end began to come, thirty
minutes after the first cheering began.
The flag of Illinois was the first to re
sume Its place on the floor, and the
. others followed gradually, while the
chairman jpounded for order.
BAILEY TAKES THE CHAIR.
When half an hour had elapsed Sen
ator Bailey of Texas took the presid
ing oncer's chair and began rapping
for order. It was some time before the
enthusiasm, which wae now confined
to the galleries and which was prin
cipally disorder, could be quieted.
Many of the delegates and others be
g^an to hiss disapproval, but this only
served to epur on the Hearst rooters,
and a battle of sound ensued.
"The State of Colorado," called the
c>rk.
The response was immediate and
Thomas J. O'Donnell was Introduced
and began a speech seconding the nom
ir.stion of Judge Parker. The quiet of
exhaustion prevailed as O'Donnell pro
ceeded and approval of his utterances
was confined to handclapping.
When O'Donnell referred In compli
mentary terms to the great leader of
the past two campaigns there was a
demonstration in which the name of
Bryan was heard above the uproar.
There was, he said, no need of a pro
testation of loyalty to the last two
Democratic platforms.
He invited "the prodigals who had
been feeding on husks" back into the
fold, "lor." he said, "we need all kinds
of Democrats in this campaign." His
mention of Parker's name was greeted
vith shouts and applause. "Colorado
once more joins hands with New York,"
he concluded, "and the echo comes
back, 'Parker, popular rights and vic
tory.' "
DISORDER IN GALLERIES.
After the applause which followed
O'Donnc-ll's conclusion Connecticut was
called. Walter S. Cummings was rec
ognized and took the platform to sec
end tht nomination of Judge Parker.
Many of the spectators began leaving
the floor and the galleries and the
tramp of their feet was a new disturb
ance.
Irving Handy of Delaware followed
Cummings and nominated George Gray.
He began by saying:
"Delaware offers to you her noblest,
bravest and best," and a cheer went
up. Jed by the Delaware delegation.
Before Handy had closed the disorder
became eo pronounced that the clerk
announced that "the chair Indulged in
the hope that the .guests would permit
the business to proceed unmolested."
The speaker finished amid brief cheer
ing.
â¢"Florida," called the clerk.
John S. Beard of that State, who
*as standing by the West Virginia
reservation, asked for recognition,
which the chair at first denied him,
not knowing who he was. After some
explanation the chair Bald:
"The chair will recognize the gentle
man from Florida when he is in his
proper place."
Beard bowed, took his place by the
Florida sign and seconded the nomin
ation of Hearst.
"Georgia," called the clerk.
"The chair recognizes Moses Wright
of Georgia," said Senator Bailey and
Wright took the stand to second
Parker. He spoke in clear, ringing
tones and held the attention of the
convention closely. Â«
TRY TO STOP SPEAKERS.
Another Parker shout greeted the
ppeaker when he mentioned the name
of the Nc^- York candidate and the
crowd thought that this was the con
clusion of his speech. He continued,
however, and was promptly advised by
the irreverent In the gallery to "cut It
out." He failed to follow the advice,
however, and was greeted by a chorus
of cries intended to drown his voice.
Ho, however, finished his address in a
few words more and got a round of ap
plause.
At 12:03 Idaho was called, but made
no response.
"Illinois." ehouted the clerk and Clar
ence Darrow of that State was pre
sented and besan a speech seconding
the nomination of Hearst. He made
this plain at the outset and at the
name of Hearst the galleries vented
their enthusiasm. When he said, "It
seems to be fate that the men who once
scuttled the Democratic ship shall once
more be placed in power," there were
cheers and hisses.
â¢The Democracy of Jefferson, the
Democracy of Bryan." was a phrase
from Darrow which struck the con
vention. After the shout which fol
lowed a voice from the gallery behind
the platform rang out. "Three cheers
for Bryan." The cheers were given
with a will. Darrow's speech enliv
ened the wearying crowd and he was
freely applauded. Darrow in closing

then recognized and on behalf of a I
majority of the delegation, seconded
the nomination of Hearst.
Governor Vardeman of Mississippi
stood on his chair and in a brief speech
seconded Parker's nomination.
MANY CALLS FOR BRYAN.
Montana was next called and Sena
tor Clark of that State arose in his
place and seconded the nomination of
Parker.
Nebraska came next and the noise
of the convention was hushed as the
name fell from the clerk's lips. C. J.
Smythe responded, but before he
could speak the convention began a
demonstration, in which the name of
Bryan was heard above the uproar.
"Bryan, Bryan," yelled the crowd.
Bryan finally arose and, standing on
the chair, endeavored to quiet the
demonstration, but he was only an in
centive for a fresh outburst. Bryan
with a j>almleaf fan motioned the
delegates to take their seats.
When he could make himself heard
he simply announced that Wisconsin
had a candidate to present, and Ne
braska yielded her place on the roll
call to that State. David S. Rose,
Mayor of Milwaukee, was at once
recognized and took the platform to
place Edward C'Wall in nomination.
Missouri, which had been passed in
advertently on the rollcall, was called,
and ex-Senator Harris of Kansas
made response. He seconded the
nomination of Cockrell in a brief
speech delivered from the platform.
Many delegates began leaving the
hall, pushing their way through the
crowded seats and causing much con T
fusion.
The galleries also began to thin out-
Then an alternate far off to the left,
overcome by bracers, mounted the
chair and with uncertain gestures de
manded attention. A couple of police
men promptly hustled him out.
ROSE ARRAIGNS PARKER.
Nevada was called at the conclusion
of Senator Harris' speech. A delegate
arose and seconded from his place on
the floor the nomination of Hearst.
New Hampshire seconded the nom
ination of Judge Parker, as also did
New Jersey.
Mayor Rose then took the New York
delegation to task severely for present
ing Judge Parker. i
"The nation has been caning on
New York for New York to tell us
what are the views of their candi
date," he sung out. "but he said noth
ing."
Loud applause and cries from the
galleries followed. Rose proceeded
with an arraignment of Parker's can
didacy in such strong terms that a
point of order was raised by Oscar
Miles, a Kansas delegate, who yelled
amid the uproar when Chairman Bai
ley asked him to state it, "The gentle
man is not speaking in behalf of any
candidate, but in general arraignment
of the Democratic party."
Chairman Bailey overruled the
point of order with the statement that
it was not within the province of the
chair, to pass upon what a speaker
shouid say. "I wish to say that I
don't want to stir up a row," declared
Rose after he was allowed to resume.
The sentence, however, was met with
cries of derision.
DISPLEASES CONVENTION.
A. J. Barr, a" Pennsylvania delegate,
interjected that the speaker had no
right to resume along the same lines.
When Rose declared that he present
ed things in a spirit of good fellowship
he was interrupted. Rose grew rapidly
unpopular and was Interrupted with
cries and stamping. But he persisted
and finally amid much confusion
named Edward C. Wall as Wisconsin's
candidate.
North Carolina gave a second to the
Parker nomination.
Chairman Cole of the North Dakota
delegation took the platform and an
nounced that he had a name to present
to the convention that had not yet
been presented. "Who is he?" demand
ed the conventiorf. "I'll name him,"
retorted Cole, who proceeded with his
speech. "The candidate we , wish to
present to you," he continued, "seems
to have only one objection and that is
that he comes from too far south*."
Cole branched into a political discus
sion and the audience amused itself by
making loud guesses as to who the
nominee would be. Chairman Bailey i
tried to quiet the clamor which had
brought Cole to a stop.
The chair begged the convention to
hear the speaker and said "because the
speaker declares he will not leave the
stand until he finishes."
NOMINATES WILLIAMS. i
At last Cole got to the end, which
was the declaration that nts candidate
was John Sharp Williams of Missis
sippi. A round of applause followed
the call of the name of the Democratic
leader of the House.
Neither Ohio nor Oregon had a candi
date to indorse and Michael J. Ryan of
Pennsylvania seconded the nomination
of Parker. ' â¢!,
By this time the audience was get
ting restless and was not trying to hide
it. When Rhode Island was reached
John j. Fitzgerald of that State second
ed the nomination of Hearst.
The audience cried "time" on him be
fore he got fairly started, but he stuck
out his four minutes.

NOTIFICATION OF SWALLOW.
The Civic Council, an organization
composed of representatives of the dif
ferent religious bodies of the city, has
started an active campaign to increase
retail liquor licenses from J41 per quar
ter, the highest amount collectable
under the charter, to $125 per quarter.
In, order to accomplish that purpose
petitions are being circulated among
electors for signatures. If 15 per cent
of the voters of the city and county
sign the petition the Election Commis
sioners will be compelled to place the
proposed ordinance on the official bal
lot to be voted November 8.
Members of the Civic Council believe
the required number of signatures will
be secured in time for the Commis
sioners to issue the required thirty
days' notice to electors prior to the
election.
, If the petitions receive the required
number of signatures and a majority
of votes cast are in favor of the ordi
nance, it becomes a law which the
Board of Supervisors cannot repeal
without submitting the question to a
vote of the people.
The Civic Council contends that the
liquor traffic costs the city 90 per cent
of the expense to maintain the Police
Department and its adjunct, the police
courts, while the saloon men pay only
20 per cent of the taxes. The further
contention of the organization is that
the increase of the licenses to $125 per
quarter will simply cause liquor men
to pay their Just portion.
The council also intends to take up
the question of a special school tax.
The members of the organization claim
that the schools of San Francisco are
in bad condition on account of the
lack of funds, and it will be part of the
work of the organization to secure a
uniform rate' of school taxes for all
time.
Estimates have been made as to the
cost of the "proposed campaign and,
figuring the voting population of the
city and county at 80,000, there will be
$5000 necessary to carry the movement
along. Funds are now being solicited
for the purpose stated.

Taxes Raised.

If elected President of the United States our
candidate will take the executive chair clothed
with the wis.lorn to understand the constitu
tion, which ho Is sworn to support and gifted
with reverence for the principles It was or
dained to obtain. Courageous, conservative,
wise and self-poised, he will be content to
properly uld In shaping' our domwrtlc policy,
to advance the happiness and prosperity of all
our people and help conduct our foreign- rela
tions to as to promote peace and avoid en
tangling alliances and complications.
Against him the Republican party presents
a candidate restless under the limitations of
a constitution he does not appreciate or under
stand. Reckless of international obligations,
and having reduced the Republican party to a
State of blind subjection, he will keep our
country in a state of perpetual unrest, destroy
ing our domestic quietude and disturbing in
ternational tranquillity by his all-consumlns
thirst for power.
RoasevcltlHR Is a distinct Issue In Ameri
can politics. Strenuous, impetuous and wor
shiping blindly at his own shrine, four more
years of his methods will result In such
usurpation of power by the executive as to
leave to us "a republic In name only," and
possibly involve us In a foreign war. Let us
accept the Issue and present his opponent.
New York's "chief Judge." with absolute con
fidence that when he comÂ«s from his healthful
country estate, as did Washlngton.Jefferson and
Madison, to occupy the great office of President
of the United States, he will prove a worthy
successor to those Illustrious patriots, destroy
the shadow of a one-man power which now
threatens the destiny of our country, and
measure up to the high hopes and expectations
of the American people.
Lovers of constitutional government, re
â¢pect-rs of property rights and advocates of
the Jrst claims or labor, will have In this
blameless citizen, loyal Democrat, wise and
upright Judge, an executive, when elected, who
will reapect the well defined functions of the
executive, judicial and legislative branches of
the Government. Judge Parker stands for a
democratic republic; President Roosevelt for
a "republican empire."
Judge Parker has not sought the nomina
tion, nor rvlll his candidacy have been dictated
by any faction. Interest or section. President
Roosevelt, to obtain his nomination, not only
ruthlessly abandoned Â£Â«Â« power of public pa
tronage to reduce his party leaders to ' in
voluntary servitude," but over the Republican
convention at Chicago hovered his ambitious,
dominnticg spirit, dictating Us every step and
action.
With such a candidate, no Democrat can
refuse to support him and assign a reason not
born of prejudice, misrepresentation or fac
tional spirit.
Thoughtful Democrats from every section
of ''this country of ours" have reached the
conclusion that incomparably above all others,
he Is tha one man whom all Democrats can
unite upon without explanation or apology.
ST. LOUIS, July 8.â Thomas H. Ball
of Texas spoke on behalf of Parker's
nomination as follows:

The session of the convention to
night brought to light many points of
interest to Californlans. The demon
stration that followed the presenta
tion of Parker's name to the conven
tion proved beyond argument the con
ditions that led Tarpey to abandon the
proposed giant special train in which
he had -intended to carry all the dele
gates dwelling west of the Missouri
River to the convention city. It was
explained when the California special
cars arrived here as the tall end of
an overland express that Inability to
make connections and adjust rates had
compelled the abandonment of Tarpey's
plan to bottle the Western delegates on
one train.
The rabid pro-Hearst-anti-Parker
sentiment that dominates the Califor
nia delegation almost precipitated a
riot in the convention shortly after 10
o'clock to-night. A large Parker ban
ner, carried by the New York delega
tion, fell from its frame when it was
being carried past the California res
ervation. The Californlans, taking ad

OAKLAND, July 8.â A contest has
been started over the probating of the
will of the late Henry Heyland by his
niece, Mrs. Mary Wright, to whom he
left but $250 out of an estate valued at
$20,000. The deceased was 90 years of
age at the time of his death, and it is
claimed was not competent to make a
will. He left his property to twenty
five different friends and relatives in
this country and Ireland. Mrs. Wright
Is his nearest relative, and if successful
in her suit will be entitled to about a
third of the entire estate.
The deceased was a well-known resi
dent of East Oakland and owned an
extensive rock quarry at the end of
Thirteenth avenue, from which ho
gained a comfortable Income. Two
years ago he. was taken before the court
on at charge of incompetence. He had
become possessed with the idea that
fairies were dancing over his bed at
night and would insist upon sprinkling
water on the floor of his room under
the belief that this would keep them
away. His health improved afterward
and the visions left him. It is upon his
actions at that time that Mrs. Wright
bases her reasons for bringing the
present action.

Some dissatisfaction is expressed at
the action of the university authorities
in delaying so long the interpretation
of the Rhodes will, which could have
been done, six months ago as well as
now. The result of the delay has been
a, great loss of valuable time to the
graduates, who studied for and passed
the test, and their futures will have
.to be materially altered In consequence.
Some. of the disappointed ones even
charge that the- university used them
as catspaws, so that In case the under
graduate students could hot meet the
test the graduate students could be re
lied upon to furnish a representative
from the State to Oxford. ,
In choosing the schola'r the commit
tee was guided much by, the provisions
of the Rhodes will, which' demands of
the candidates the following qualifica
tions: First, literary and scholastic
The selection of Crittenden was made
from among six other candidates for
the Rhodes scholarship. His nomina
tion was decided upon after a long
struggle in committee. It was under
stood that the announcement would
not be made for at least a week yet,
because at last accounts the commit
tee had about decided to review the
qualifications of the candidates. With
this understanding Crittenden left for
Congress Springs* this morning, and he
Is as yet unaware of the good fortune
that has fallen upon him.
The sudden decision of the commit
tee to make public its selection is some
thing of an enigma to the candidates
for the scholarship. While none of
the committee will speak, it is under
stood that they had split upon the in
terpretation of the provisions of Cecil
Rhodes' will. In making the rules the
trustees interpreted the will to mean
that graduate studentB may be sent
from America, which is allowed more
latitude than South Africa, whence
only undergraduates will be received.
The California committee, however,
finally agreed to consider only the
undergraduate students In this first
competition, fearing that if it did oth
erwise a precedent would be estab
lished that would be reactionary in its
effect. Thjs decision left only threÂ«
students for the committee's consid
eration, Crittenden, Â¦ C. K. Judy and
W. J. Musgrove being the only under
graduates. It eliminated the foui
graduatesâ Beverly S. Allen, M. 13.

Originally Crittenden came from the
Modesto High School, Modesto having
been the scene of his birth and rearing.
He was born in Modesto twenty-two
years ago. His father is Thomas T.
Crittenden, a man well known in Stan
islaus County.
BOItX IX MODESTO.
Even before coming to the university
Crittenden had achieved some prom
inence. He was one of three young
men to make a run around the world
against time. The three years that he
spent at the Lowell High School in
San Francisco preparing for the uni
versity were notable for the leader
ship to which his fellow students elect
ed him and his prowerj as an athlete.
Crittenden has figured as one of the
leaders of the activities in the univer
sity, and. his. selection is received
with geyral satisfaction. Since coming
to the university he has been Identified
in some way or another with most of the
movements of his fellow students. He
was honored with election to the pres
idency of hi3 junior class. He asso
ciated himself as a staff editor on The
Dally Californian and devoted himself
to athletics.
BERKELEY. July 8.â To William
Clark Crlttenden, a senior in the col
lege of letters at the University of Cali

resenting his State and university as
a Rhodes scholar at Oxford Univer
sity. His appointment to the high
est honor In the gift of the university
was announced to-day from the presi
dent's office, the selection having been
made by a committee that was nom
inated for the purpose by President
Wheeler.
The club also wants the extension
of the Key Route into North Berkeley
nnd the reduction of the wires of the
California Electric Corporation from
their high poles on Grove street to
underground conduits. E. J. Martin
reported that he had interviewed John

was decided to interest the Town and

the club, made such a plea for a ho
tel that he soon got the ears of all the

Quotations of iron and steel products
average slightly lower, although the
markets are almost nominal. Woolen
mills are confronted with a rising mar
ket for raw material, ranchmen at the
West holding the new clipped for bet

sustained by the London auction sales.
In hides domestic grades of July salt
ing are slightly firmer owing to the

which receipts are now large.
Conditions remain unchanged in the
market for foreign dry goods.

Midsummer quiet prevails in mercan

nessed much idle machinery at manu
facturing plants, yet the tenor of re
ports from leading cities Indicates in
creased confidence in the future. The
combination of reduced output and
good weather for seasonable merchan
dise has improved the situation by con
tracting stocks of goods in the hands
of jobbers and retailers. Collections at
the end of the fiscal year were also a
little better than anticipated. Trans
porting lines are more active, as shown
by the increase of. 4.2 per cent in rail
way earnings compared with June,
1903,
Wheat (Including flour) exports for
the week ending July 7 aggregate 787,

Reports from cotton and oats, how
ever, are favorable. Railway earnings
confirm earlier reports of good June re
ports in the probable increase of 3 per
cent in the gross earnings. Wool con
tinues the strongest of the textiles,
with shifting from the old to the new
clip, accompanied by an advance of
from 1 to 3 cents per pound and con
siderable buying by manufacturers here
and at the West. Primary receipts are
strong and two-thirds of the Montana
clip is already reported sold. The lum
ber trade is rather quiet as a whole.
NEW YORK, July 8.â Bradstreefs to
morrow will say:
Trade and industry have been at a
low ebb this week, reflecting vacation
influences, summer shutdowns and gen
erally quiet distributive demand. Chief
interest, of course, centers in the cotton
situation, and the irregular movements
of securities are traceable to uncertain
ty generated by reports of excessive
moisture in the winter wheat belt and
too cool weather for corn.
Charles Tully was president of the

DENVER, July 8.â Four of the six
union men who returned to their homes
in the Cripple Creek district, but who
were deported by two dozen masked
men Wednesday night, with the admo
nition that if they returned they would
be hanged, told the story of the de
portation to President Mover in the of
fices of the Western Federation of Min
ers to-day. President Mover then held
an extended conference with Attorneys
John M. Murphy and Frank J. Hangs.
It 1b understood that criminal action
will be started against a dozen citizens
of the Cripple Creek district who were
recognized by the deported men and
whose names were tumedSover to Presi
dent Moyer. The men who were forced
'out of the district insist that they had
a perfect right there. D. C. O'Neill was
secretary of the retail clerks and had a
pass from General Bell allowing him
twenty-four hours in which to pack up
his goods, but it was disregarded.
James Frazer, a miner, had a similar
pass guaranteeing him the freedom of
the camp for forty-eight hours, but he
was arrested as aoon as he reached
Victor.

At this afternoon's meeting of the
Board of Public Works, Mayor Olney
referred the communication to City
Attorney McElroy, who said:
"There is unfortunately no munici
pal ordinance which will apply to this
matter. The signboard is inside the
property line and cannot be legally
reached. But I suggest that the pro
prietors of that advertisement be in
formed of the sentiment expressed by
Porter Post, which I have no doubt
is felt by many citizens."
Secretary \V. B. Fawcett of the
Board of Works was Instructed to send
a copy of the veterans' resolutions to
Varney & Green, the advertisers who
control the signboards.
Resolved by Admiral D. D. Porter PoÂ»t.
Orand Army of the Republic, Department of
California and Nevada, that the attention of
Mayor Olney be called to thlÂ« matter with a
view to having this offensive advertisement re
moved at once.
Wherea*. such display Is an Insult to every
true American regardless of politics; therefore
be it
All of this appealed so strongly to
the patriotic members of Porter Post
as a desecration of the high position oc
cupied by the President of the United
States that the subject was laid before
the post at its last meeting, and the
following resolutions were adopted
unanimously:
Whereas, a large painting of the President
of the' United States is conspicuously dis
played at the northeast corner of Webster and
Thirteenth streets in this city an a brewery
advertisement and
The advertisement pictures the Presi
dent in full Rough Rider uniform and
gazing In painted admiration at the
cooling beverage, as If enjoying the
treat soon to follow.
The old soldiers have by formal reso
lutions made protest against the use
of the President's portrait for advertis
ing purposes. They sent their objec
tions to-day in writing to Mayor Olney,
with a request that action be taken to
remove What they declare is an insult-
Ing display.
"Insulting and offensive" are the epi
thets applied by Admiral D. D. Porter
Pest No. 169, Grand Army of the Re
public, to a flaring brewery advertise
ment that pictures President Roosevelt

While the Prince was led off to jail
his promised wife went to San Fran
cisco to get together another $250. She
has promised to return to-night with
the necessary money, and says that if
she can get her lover out of jail and
secure a marriage license the nuptials
will ?till take place.
Mies Falker is a young woman of cul
ture, according to Ranima Aramancha
Â£engh, who says he met her in Bos
ton. They afterward renewed a pleas
ant acquaintanceship in San Francisco.
They are to go to London, away from
" a country where a gentleman can be
thrown into prison on the unbased
charse of a serving man."
Prince Itaninia Sengh appeared in
court this morning for his arraignment
and entered a plea of not guilty. He
expected to have been able to settle
the cape, and this afternoon was to
have been married to Miss Falker.
They hoped to leave the "wild and
woolly West"' and go to London, where
alone, the Prince says, life is worth
living
"Boston," he said this evening, "is
the home of culture and refinement.
The farther west you come the Ies3
there ia of It, and in San Francisco
there is none. This country Is the
limit, end I ehall be glad to leave It."
While he was saying this he was
seated in the County Jail. After he hart
entered his plea of not guilty this
Jnornlngr the District Attorney request
ed Judge Ureene to increase the bail
bond from $250 cash bail to $500. The
Prince had but $50 with him, and
therefore had to go to jail Instead of
appearing before the hymeneal altar.
The raise in bail was unexpected, but
the District Attorney, in explanation
of his request, stated that $250 was
very low ball for a charge of grand
larceny.
Courts are heedless alike of the loves
of prince and pauper. The wheels of
justice spoiled a marriage ceremony
here to-day that was to have united
ilanima Aramancha Sengh, claiming to
be the Ron of the Maharajah of Lahore,
who presented Queen Victoria with the
famous Kohinoor diamond of fabulous
worth, to Miss Mabel Falker, now of
San Francisco, but formerly of Boa
ton. The Prince has become enmeshed
in the law through a quarrel with one
V. Piffero, a Herving man employed by
"Chris" Buckley at his country home
at Ravenswood. near Livermore. Pif
fero has sworn to a complaint charg
ing the Prince with having stolen
|62 10 from him. %

ST. PETERSBURG, July 8, 1:30 p.

although nothing is certain on this
point, that the orders for the division
will be opened at five day intervals.
Whether the warships are bound at
once for the. Par East in advance of
other warships may depend on naval
developments at the seat of war, but
there are attending circumstances
which make it seem unlikely that the
division will start on Its long Jour

ST. PETERSBURG, July 7. â The
Czar has received the following dis
patch from General Kuropatkin under
date of July 5:
"Rifle firing between patrols took
place on July 4 at the outskirts of
Vafangow, south of Senuchen and in
the neighborhood of Polaitza, The
Japanese patrols retired to the south
ward. We lost only horses and a few
men were wounded.
"According to Chinese accounts,
troops were landed at Datchjuangkhe,
thirty-seven miles southwest of Ta
kushan. A Cossack patrol, on July. 4,
pushed forward to Palamatzezza,
where considerable forces of the enemy
were discovered."
Lieutenant General Sakharoff, in a
long report to the general staff dated
July 6, covers much the same ground
as the report from General Kuropatkin.
Sakharoff gives details of a number of
other minor engagements in which the
Russians drove back the Japanese'out
posts and captured patrols, but he men
tions nothing in the nature of a consid
erable angagement or of serious losses
on either side.

ST. PETERSBURG, July 8,. 1:32
p. m.^It, is reported in a special dis
patch from Llaoyang," under yester
day's date, that a persistent rumor
is current there to the effect that a
naval engagement has occurred at
Port Arthur in which : twenty-one Jap
anese warships participated, result
ing in a Russian victory.
Great Naval Battle at Port Arthur Is
Rumored.
RUSSIAN VICTORY REPORTED.
. ST. PETERSBURG. July 8. â In a
long letter from Constantinople a cor
respondent of the St. Petersburg Ga
zette reports an interview with the
Japanese vice admiral, who is at Con
stantinople, with a proposal to re
organize the Turkish fleet. The cor
respondent states that he cannot say
whether the vice admiral's mission is
official or J individual, but he alleges
that the proposal is taken seriously in
high political circles, f :,
Abdul Hamid is eager to obtain the
necessary money for setting, the fleet
in order, but how that is to be done
puzzles everybody and temporarily
balks proceedings. The Turkish states
men who arranged^ the interview be
tween the Russian journalist and
Japanese admiral informed the corre
spondent that emissaries like the nav
al officer and secret agents of Japan
are In the Persian court, in Afghani
stan and even In large towns of Trans-
Caucasia fomenting discontent They
stated that the news that the Gover
nor General of Tiflis would be assas
sinated was received in Toklo a few
hours before the act was committed.
The Russian .Inference, from all this
is that the Japanese are plotting trou
ble for Russia everywhere and are
taking initial steps for a pan-Asiatic
league against the white race.

"TIENTSIN. July 8.â It has been
learned here from a Russian source
that the locations of some of the Jap
anese trooDS areas follows: The Sec
ond and Twelfth divisions are march
ing from Fengwangcheng in the direc
tion of Liaoyang and Saimatsa. A
division of Guards is near the Yalu
and the Tenth Division is near Taku

ing in the direction of Haicheng, and
on their left and right flanks are re
serves from the Yalu.
With thirty Japanese ships engaged
in recent attacks, without counting
that of June 23, no Russian ship has
been destroyed, .indicating how dif
ficult it is for torpedo-boats to cope 1
with battleships or .cruisers when the
latter are. prepared. This is consid
ered to be a lesson of the war and
vindicating Russia's decision to con
tinue her naval programme for the
construction of heavy ships.
Viceroy Alexieff has conferred a
long list of decorations on the sub
ordinate officers of the Vladivostok
squadron, the captains having already
been decorated by the Emperor.
Although no official announcement
to the effect has been made it is be
lieved that the Vladivostok squadron
returned to port several days ago.
include the armored cruiser Admiral
Xakhimoff. the battleship Osliabia,
the protected cruiser Aurora and the
battleship Alexander III, and possibly
the battleship Xavarin and the trans
port Â» Kamchatka. Great stacks of
charts were put on board the Admiral
Nakhimoff, the Osliabia and the Au
rora^yesterday.
The general naval situation, with
the Port Arthur squadron ready for
sorties at will, and the Vladivostok
squadron embarrassing the Japanese
transport plans, compelling the con
stant presence of Vice Admiral Kam
imura in the sea of Japan, is consid
ered to have improved very much.
There is elation everywhere over the
latest successful cruise of the Vladi
vostok squadron.
TENT OF OSCAR KING DAVIS.
CALL-HERALD CORRESPONDENT
IN THE ORIENT.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 8.â The ap
proach of the Japanese soldiers to
Kaichoa is taken as a crucial feature
of the situation. This leaves an oppor
tunity for a vigordus defense of Kal
chou, bringing south for this purpose
General Kuropatkin, who is still at
Tatchekiao, or for the Russians to
evacuate KaJchou without serious re
sistance, probably concentrating at
Tatchekiao, at which is the end of the
branch railroad connecting Newchwang
with the main line and apparently the
last place where a stand could be made
to prevent the Japanese from pushing
across the peninsula, seizing Xew
chwang and its port and establishing
a new base on the west coast of the
peninsula. The fact that the Japanese
outposts are gradually being pushed
out along the whole front, even to the
north of Llaoyang, as pointed out in the
press dispatches, makes fighting a pos
sibility almost anywnere along the
railroad. The skirmishes around Kai
chou and Senuchen enumerated in Gen
eral Kuropatkln's dispatch to the Czar
are regarded as of no particular impor
tance except for the fact that Siadiama,
one of the points mentioned, is only
eight miles from Kaichou. The skir
mishes near this place, together with
the other skirmishes. Indicate prepara
tions for an advance on Kaichou.

KANSAS CITY. Mo. July 8.âTo
oight the Kaw is falling: here and west
to Topeka, and it is confidently be
lieved that the wcrrs: 'of the flood is
over. Not for many days, however.
will normal conditions prevail at Ar
mourdale, Argentine and the low-lying
portion of Eastern Kansas City. Kans.,
where hundreds of houses of the work
ing class a:e urder water and many
plant* are inundated. In the low por
tion of Armourdale, which is located
in the most unfavorable portion of the
flooded district, the water is from three
to six feet deep.
Arrrourdale is practically abandoned,
the streets running to the rivers, and
this town of 5000 people may never be
rebuilt, two disastrous floods in thir
teen months utterly discouraging' a
majority of its former inhabitants. The
npcrcpate loss will be heavy.
Watrr is running several feet deep
throuph the little settlement of River
side, on the west side of the Kaw
River, in Kansas City, Kans. This dis
trict is suffering: quite as much as it
did last year, because although the
volume of water in the Kaw is not
nearly so great as during the June flood
of last year, the Riverside district this
><?ar must withstand the full force of
The overflow from the Kaw, while last
year the Kaw cut a channel direct from
Argentine ihrough the stockyards and
the '.vest bottoms to the Missouri River.
Argentine, Armourdale and Riverside
are r.ll daraaced as much as last year
for this reason. In Riverside hundreds
cf employes of the packing-houses and
west bottom factories were driven from
their homes, and to-nipht only the tops
of their houses are visible above the
surface of the water. Scores of houses
have boen washed away. The* new
plant of the Nelson Morris Packing
Company is being erected in Riverside.
The unfinished buildings are now sur
rounded by a lake from six to twelve
feet deep.
Looking southwest and northwest
from Riverside, the view is a dismal
one. To the northwest for a mile can
be seen the lowlands of Eastern Karv
*as City, Kans.. and to the southwest
for miles the stricken Armourdale dis
trict, all making one vast lake dotted
with the tops of houses, factories and
<;ther buildings.

ST. PETERSBURG, June 22. â Little
surprise was occasioned in official cir
cles here by the news of the assassina
tion of Nicolas Ivanovitch Bobrikoff,
Governor General of Finland. The re
lentless measures which he adopted to
crush out every vestige of liberty
among the Fins arrayed against him
every instinct of patriotism of that
sorely oppressed people, and it was felt
that it was only a question of time
when one would arise to rid his coun
trymen of their .tyrant.
Eobrikoff was chief of staff of the
fynbrikoff's Killing Expected.
Several very proper visitors to' the St. Louis Exposi
tion have made vigorous protest to President Roosevelt
against the alarming lack of civilized garb that distin
guishes some of the semi-savage representatives of the
Philippine Islands. The critics should remember that
propriety is not prudery and that even truth looks good
to man when* it is naked.
The Supreme Court of Nevada granted a new' trial. re
cently to four convicted murderers, one of whom stood
self-confessed of the terrible crime of which he is ac
cused. It is not generally that we are given so clear an
illustration of the fact as this, that law is not always
justice in American courts.
COTTONY CUSHION SCALE-9. R-
M.. City. The State Board of Agricul
ture-elves the following as a wash to
be used on fruit trees affected with
cottony cushion scale: "Rosin, twenty
pounds: caustic soda (70 per cent), six
pounds; fish oil. three pounds. Place
these Ingredients in a large boiler,
pouring over them about twenty gal
lons of water, and cook thoroughly over
a brisk fire 'for at least three hours;
then add hot water, a little occasion
ally, and stir well until you have not
less than fifty gallons of hot solution.
Place this in a spray tank and add cold
water to make the necessary amount.
Never add cold water when cooking."
The amount mav be diminished by re
ducing the proportions of Ingredients.

"Progress is revolution in disguise
and by degrees," a well-known Tory
has recently said, "it is destined to
make the peers powerless and the poor

Cromwell! "There will never be a good
time in England till we have done with
the- lords." BBlgSj

WHILE the Djrople of theBray, Elmhurst, Mel
rose, Lockwood and Fulton school districts in
Alameda County arc considering ways and
means to provide a union high school that shall
accommodate the boys and. girls in those districts, the
Women's Council of^ Sacramento is similarly concerned.
Sacramento needs a new high school structure and is
striving to obtain it. The Alameda County districts
that have been named must either have their own
accommodations or send abroad to take the higher edu
cational branches the pupils who come from the gram
mar grades.
A meeting has been held in Fruitvale and it was
there stated; by T. O. Crawford, Superintendent of
Schools, that an expense of $j 0,000 will be necessary the
first year to rent and equip a building and employ the
necessary teachers and that the cost for the second
year will be about half that of the first.
Sacramento's proposition naturally involves a greater
outlay. If the voters consent bonds will be issued to
erect a building adequate to the city's needs for "many
years. The office of the Women's Council, as they view
it, is to persuade the voters that ft is necessary and

A very simple method of locating
fractures in bone?, particularly in Ions
ones, by the aid of a tuning fork la
proposed by a Chicago surgeon." A
stethoscope is placed over the bone
as near as possible to the point of sus
pected fracture and on the side where
the skin is thinnest. Then a vibrating
tuning fork is placed against the flesh
near the bone, but on the other side
of the fracture if possible. If the bone
is continuous a distinct, clear sound
will be heard in the stethoscope, but
if the break is between the two, this
sound- will be faint and irregular. &i
the vibrations will not be transmitted
past the break. Of course this method
depends upon the fact that hard bont*
is an excellent conductor of vibration,
while tissue is not. â¢ Perhaps even a
more valuable application of this Idea
would be in finding out when a break
has knitted properly, for when the
joining Is again perfect the sound will
be as clear as that of an unbroken
bone.

The millionaire, crack polo player,

the examiner and passed up to Mr.
Gould by Mr. Ramsey, ran something
as follows:
After a moment's reflection. President
Ramsey replied: "There is a new ex
aminer in Pittsburg who came from
New England, and I am sure that he
never saw you. I will give you an or
dinary card entitling you to an exam

him."
"You have got this thing down fine,
Ramsey," remarked Mr. Gould, after
scrutinizing the book of rules and the
physician's question blank.
"Yes, I think our method covers all
the points," said President Ramsey.
"Anybody that passes this examination
can felicitate himself on being a pretty
good man."
"Say, I would like to try it," said Mr.
Gould, impulsively. "Have you an ex
aminer on the line that does not know
me?"
George J. Gould and President Ram

Â¦ Bobrikoff enforced this programme
with ruthless severity and seemed to
delight in the opportunities offered
him to show his aversion and contempt
for the dearest traditions and senti
ments of the people whom he had
been sent to rule. Wholesale decrees
of exile and deportation to the interior
of Russia were issued against the most
distinguished leaders of Finnish opin
ion. All the leading newspapers were
suppressed. Education, except of the
most rudimentary sort, was practi
cally forbidden. The Polytechnicum
in Helsingfors, the only technical in
stitute in Finland, was closed. All
meetings of students were stopped. A
Count was exiled because his wife, who
had the misfortune to be an excellent
singer, gave concerts in aid of Finnish
schools. Protests proved worse than
useless. They were invariably follow
ed by still more ruthless acts of op
pression.
Sqme of the leading jurists of Eu
rope joined in an address to the Czur
protesting against the flagrant viola
tions of Finland's constitutional
rights. The Czar's acknowledgment
of it took the form of a decree invest
ing Bobrikoff with despotic powers
and empowering him on his own re
sponsibility to take whatever r steps he
might deem necessary in the event of
the measures adopted by the Finnish
authorities proving insufficient. He
made full use of his extraordinary
prerogatives and his iron grip tight
ened upon Finland. He turned the
Senate into a Russian police bureau,
in which only the Russian language
was spoken and only his own orders
carried out; he appointed Russians to
all important offices and overran the
country with Russian spies. In the
eyes of the Finns he becme the incar
nation of the most merciless form of
Rusisan tyranny. Deprived of every
legitimate means of obtaining redress
against the tyrant it is small wonder
that his assassin, Herr Schaumann,
should have concluded, as he stated
In -a letter found on his body ad
dressed to the Czar: "There is only
one way to take in self-defense for
rendering him innocuous. The rem
edy is violent, but it is the only" way."
In a message to Bobrikoff's widow
the Czar has declared that Russia will*
ever treasure her husband's memory as
that of ji true hero and. noble patriot,
but. history will" pronounce a highly
different verdict upon him. He trans
formed Finland from a loyal province
to one that would welcome any oppor
tunity to rid itself of the Russian
yoke. When Nicholas I had to con
front the united forces of France and
England he intrusted the care of hi3
capital to the Finnish regiments and
full worthy did they prove of the trust
imposed in them, but Czar Nicholas II
would not dare now employ them for
a similar purpose. Whatever perils
may -beset his empire' he must know
that It would be futile tovu>neal for
the support of his subjects in Finland,
whose chartered liberties he sent Gen
eral Bobrikoff to trample under fool

Among other noteworthy fiction features will be one
of Norman Duncan's famous Newfoundland stories,
"The Chase of the Tide," told with all the vigor and
strength that have made this author famous as a writer
of stories of the simple, rugged fisher folk of the New
foundland banks: "A Corner in Paradise." an original
little storiette by Keith Gordon, aptly illustrated; stori
ettes by Colin S. Collins, Euphemia Holden and Ruth
Santelle, all names familiar to magazine readers; "That
Terrible Fiscal Question," by Jerome K. Jerome, and the
usual Sunday morning talk by the Parson and a pithy
fable by Nicholas Nemo.
The leading special article is a sympathetic study at
dose range of Henry T. Oxnard. the sugar magnate,
which is of especial interest in view of the possibility of
his being chosen as the next Senator from California.
The article is by Alfred Dezendorf and deals especially
with the personal side of Mr.. Oxnard and his home life.
In "The Hand-Painted Summer Girl," Augusta Prescott
describes the latest Eastern fads in fancy decorative
hand- painted work on fans, parasols, hats and various
articles of dress; in "The Natural Woman," Colonel Kate
gives some good advice as to preserving beauty without
artificial aids; Helen Rowland contributes a page on
"The Domestic Training of the Tot," and on the
Women's Page Madge Moore describes the latest femi
nine type, the "Fichu Girl."
"A Morning Row on Stow Lake" in three colors is
the first of a series of full-page drawings by John F.
Woolrich, depicting scenes and incidents in Golden Gate
Park and on the Ocean Beach. These will appear from
time to time. The puzzle page, as usual, announces the
names of the one hundred and fifty lucky guessers and
furnishes material for a new contest. "Pop Goes the
Weasel" willbe^ found upon the music page, which, as
usual, is in colors.
THE feature of The Call Magazine to-morrow will
be the first installment of "In the Bishop's Car
riage," the novel which, since its appearance a
few months ago. has rapidly leaped into favor as
one of the few entirely original novels of the' past few
seasons. It is from the pen of Miriam Michelson, for
a long time a member'of The Call staff^and who, until
her departure for the wider fields of the' East some time
ago, was one of the best-known newspaper women in
this State. /;.-
The novel is an elaboration of a short story by the
Â¦same title which appeared in one of t the magazines and
which made such a forcible impression that Miss Michel
son was at once requested to continue the adventures
of the irrepressible Nance, which she did with such
signal success that the book has been enthusiastically
heralded as the one literary find of the year. The story
deals with the career of Nance Olden, the female accom
plice of a professional crook, and with her ultimate re
generation, and is at times exciting and always interest
ing. The story will be fully illustrated and will be pub
lished complete in four installments.

Charles Wyndham revived "The
Liars " at his new theater last evening
for the last time. For the last, because
the acting rights of this Jones play
will run out at the 'end of next week.
The author, however, was not on hand
to oversee the rehearsals. Mr. Jones is
at the seaside working on a new play,
which It is understood has been com
missioned by Wyndham.
It was announced some time ago that
arrangements were complete for pro
ducing Pemberton's maiden comedy in
the United States, and after some prun
ing has been done it may enjoy some
favor with audiences at home.
It really does seem as if a new pian
isi of the first rank had arisen. He is
an American, too, although he has
been eighteen years away from home,
and is now, perhaps, more Teuton
than Yankee. His name is Otto Voss
and his two piano recitals in London
have focusod on him much critical
attention, the general feeling being,
apparently, that even Paderewski has
found a rival in this clean cut, solid
looking young man of 28 or 29. When
he was 8 or 10 years old he appeared
in New Tork a few times as a wonder
child pianist and since then has been
studying in France, Germany and
Austria, putting on the finishing
touches with Paderewski's teacher,
the mighty Leschitizky, and finally be
coming the assistant of that famous
producer of great pianists. Voss left
Leschitizky to become first professor
of the piano at the Cologne Conserv
atory and is now well launched as a
piano virtuoso. He is a rare com
pound of strength, delicacy, really
marvelous technique and emotional
qualities pretty well under con
trol, and has the personal
magnetism that made the dif
ference between Von Bulow and Ru
binstein, for example. He is not whet
would be called a "pretty" man, but
he seems to have enough virility, sin
cerity and steadfastness to carry him
far indeed. At any rate, you will
probably have an opportunity of Judg
ing of him, for he is planning to make
a big Americn tour late in the au
tumn.
We expected things of Max
Pemberton. His first play, "The Finish
ing School," which was brought out at
Wyndham's last night, is genuinely
amusing in Jt>ots, invariably pictur
esque and occasionally rather dramatic,
but when it was announced several
raonths ago that there was to be a
stage piece by the author of "The Gar
den of Swords" and "Kronstadt" we
looked for something decidedly original
in the way of plot. That, however, is
exactly what Pemberton has not given
us, for his heroine is just another Lady
Ursula, who dons boy's clothes In order
to visit her love therein and promptly
gets embroiled in duels and that sort
of thing. Oddly enough, we had the
tame situation at Wyndham's a few
weeks ago, when "The Sword of the
Kins"â brought over from the United
â¢tatesâ gave Ida Molesworth an oppor
tunity to swagger about in knicker
bockers during the short time that tha
I lay lasted.
" The XeVer, Never Land." the drama
that this actor-manager recently
wrote for his own use, contained a sit
uation that was practically new, and
the idea of "Lucky Durham," which
Barrett produced at Liverpool the
other night, is even more striking. It
tells the story of a man's scheme for
bringing down vengeance on the head
of his own father. The parent is Lord
Mountfallon, a wealthy and pleasure
loving English peer, who has betrayed
a woman of lowly birth, and Durham,
the hero of the play, is the illegitimate
child of the two. At the beginning of
the drama we see him, as a young
man, handicapped by the stain on his
birth and determined to revenge him
self and his mother, and throughout
The play the day of reckoning comes
nearer and nearer. Durham's nick
name of '"Lucky" is well deserved.
Fortune wherewith to carry out his
plan of revenge comes to him as it
came to Monte Crlsto and he gets to
be a great financier. His plan is to
ruin Lord Mountfallon, to get pos
session of his ancestral home and to
install his mother there, but the piece
ends dramatically with Durham turn
ed from his purpose by the mother,
just as he is ready to strike the final
and crushing blow. The play's recep
tion at Liverpool was so enthusiastic
that Barrett means to bring it to Lon
don as soon as possible, and I under
stand that the disposition of the
American rights is already being
discussed.

Special Correspondence.
â¢" 'From themselves,' said Millbank;
'and the heralds they pay to paint their
carriages. But I go to facts. When
Henry VII called his first Parliament
there were only twenty-nine temporal
peers to be found, and even some of
them took their seats illegally, for they
had been attainted. Of those twenty
nine not five remain: and they, as the
Howards, for instance, are not Norman
nobility. We owe the English peerage
to three sources â the spoliation of the
churili, the open and flagrant sale of
hr.nors by the elder Stuarts and the
boroughmongering of our own times.
Those are the three main sources of
the existing peerage of England, and,
in my opinion, disgraceful ones.' "
Lord Beaconsfield might have abided
a fourth origin of the existing peerage,
to wit, the bestowal of honors upon
the mistresses of the kings and their
illegitimate children. This decorous
nation, therefore, delights to honor
those who have inherited titles from
such shameful sources!â London Truth.
" "I have always understood/ said
Coningsby. 'that our peerage was the
finest in Europe.'
" 'Ancient lineage,' said Mr. Mill
bank; 'I never heard of a peer with an
ancient lineage. The real old families
of this country are to.be found among
the peasantry; the gentry, too, may lay
some claim to old blood. I can point
you out SaXon families in this country
who can trace their pedigrees beyond
the conquest; I know of some Norman
gentlemen whose fathers undoubtedly
came over with the Conqueror. But a
petr with an ancient lineage Is to me
qwlte a novelty. No. no; the thirty
years' war of the roses freed us from
those gentlemen. I take it after the
battle of Tewkesbury, a Norman barwn
was almost as rare a being in England
as a wolf is now.'
to-da}'|? Lord Beaconsfleld answered
the question in "Conlngsby" many
years ago:
Her name was Xellie and she was
running away. No error in this state
ment, for she was in motion. She had
left all she owed to her people, all she
owed to duty, and she was surely run
ning away. She had stood on the cor
ner of Mission and Nineteenth streets
long enough, she thought, and now
with the light wagon and its load of
mjlk-cans clattering behind her she
was running away. Nellie caught a
glimpse of her driver as he came out

John R. McLean of the Cincinnati Enquirer put on
thicker paint and more feathers than any other chief
that danced around Cleveland's .scalp when Bryan took
:t. But even he was anxious to nominate the Princeton
sage and had the whole Ohio vote in his boot, to be
pulled for that, purpose. He declared that Cleveland
was "a d d old rhinoceros," but even a political
pachyderm was more popular than any other man in
the party or the country.
Without discussing Mr. McLean's good taste in re
sorting to the wet side of a zoological garden to find
a pet name for an ex-President, it must be admitted
that the situation was suggestive and deserving of study.
It revealed the inherent infirmity of the Democratic
party, its tendency to go mad and not recognize the
found Of its own voice. The country Wishes it may
recover from its malady, Init will not trust it with power
because of the radical fluctuations in its feelings as
shown by its treatment of Mr. Cleveland. Republicans
note this with keen interest and with the intention
of avoiding .such a misreading of public opinion as is
making the Democracy appear like an escape from
Bedlam. The people like and. want Roosevelt and the
mummers and those who gnaw in whispers at the repu
tations of strong men will make no headway in imitating
the daffy Democracy. v
ALOOK into the Democratic convention on , the
road and after arrival at St. Louis closely re
sembled that view of Madrid enjoyed after Asmo
deus had lifted the lid off the town. The party needed
a respectable man to run for the Presidency and has
been advertising for an eligible for two. years. The
responses have not been numerous, because about all
of that class left the party in 1896 and have not. found
a Iqw place in the fence over which they can jump
Those who have 'done so are all objectionable to
Mr. Bryan, and so, as one after another has answered
the ad.: "Wanted â A respectable gent. to. run for the
Presidency. No salary and must find himself.". Mr.
Bryan has looked them over, like the master of the
ballet does the girls who want a job at butterflying
behind the footlights. One he finds thin in the shanks
since 1896; another walks on a parenthesis acquired by
straddling in 1900; another toes in on the Kansas City
platform, and still another cannot be shaped up to suit,
even with a straight-front corset, having gorged himself
out of shape with the plutocrats.
Mr. Hearst did not answer the ad. for obvious
reasons, and has bla/iied August Belmont and.Davjd B.
Hill for purposely wording it so as to shut him out.
He has established newspapers in several cities, since*
the competition began, in order to have adequate facili
ties for expressing himself, and it is suspected that even
then thoughts arise in him lhat are- incapable of suffi
cient utterance. Of course, they are about other people."
His sumptuous, satisfactory and ornamented opinion of
himself has been made familiar to the public by himself
and goes gayly oh its way through the country, a thing
of frills and more than earthly beauty.
. So for many months the inquiry has. run and been
answered by gent, after gent., but at the meeting of
the convention -not one was certain of the job. Mr.
Olney has .been in cold storage' in Massachusetts and
has even cultivated popular manners by ordering a
toothpick with his usual lunch at the club, on a glass
of ice water and the New York Evening Post. But he
is too remote, roosts too high up in the empyrean for
ordinary people to gall their withers carrying torches
fcr him.
Judge Parker has been in lavender at Esopus, hoping
that the office would come up the Hudson and make
a landing, and Senator Gorman has sat inside of him
self, apparently with neither friends nor enemies. In
addition a job lot of favorite sons have responded from
many States, but they are among the "also men
tioned." Divided and at feud am'ong themselves, all
of these candidates have, perhaps unconsciously, fur
nished the country with one of the most remarkable
incidents in the history of American parties. When
ever Mr. Cleveland has risen or sat down, slept or
waketl, hunted, fished or cut bait, they have all shown
the liveliest fear of him. Mr. Bryan, as the "Keeper
of the Party," has found it necessary to repeat to the
country again and again his story of Cleveland's crimes
in the Presidency, and Mr. Hearst, in his string of news
papers, has told the country how bad the ex-President
is, and how abhorrent to him.
Still the worshipers in the temple of Jefferson show
an alarming tendency to take down the new idols and
sell them for junk and to dust and dress the old god
and put him in the shrine from which they all dragged
him by the heels only eight years ago. The singular
part of this situation has been that the men Who wanted
Cleveland were not all* among those who have been
steadfastly his friends. The most conspicuous among
them were men who rejoiced when his reputation was
burned in 1896 and its ashes scattered to the four winds.
St. Petersburg district when, in 1898,
the reactionary advisers of the Czar,
having determined on the complete
Russification of Finland, began to cast
around for a man best fitted by tem
perament and training to carry out
that policy. Before that the Govern
ors of Finland had been men of cul
tured stamp and high social position,
but for the work to be done it was felt
that a man of a sterner type was need
ed. Three prominent Russian states
men declined the position, being
moved thereto perhaps by considera
tion for their â¢ own personal safety,
after which Bobrikoff was given the
appointment.
"You will inspire yourself," wrote
the Czar, "with the endeavor to im
press upon the population of Finland
the supreme importance of their com
plete identification with the common
fatherland." The task thus set upon
him was to break" the national spirit
and to wipe out the constitutional lib
erties of a people who loved freedom
and who enjoyed it by virtue of the
fundamental laws of the land, which
their Russian sovereigns have success-

A high school is the intermediate step between the

Judge Troutt yesterday granted a
preliminary injunction, on application
of the White Swan Mines Company, to
prevent Letson Balliett from dispos

fully issued to himself and Florence
Balliett. It was charged in the com
plaint that Balliett. the day after re
signing as president of the company is
sued 30,000 shares to himself and
133,000 to his wife.
In an affidavit filed in the case Bal

and manager of the company and was
to receive 275,000 shares of the stock
in payment for his services in making
the mine, in Oregon', a producer. He

Since 1S95 the amount. of the penalties and
percentages paid to the various County Audi
tors of the State upon the redemption of prop
erty sold tp the State because of delinquent
taxes has been divided between the State
and the county In the proportion that the
State rate bears Â¦ to the respective county
rates. During this period there has been pal. I
In, of such moneys, by the Auditor of Madera
County alone, over $8000, and the object of the
action was to compel the return of this
amount of money to Madera County, it being
contended by the county that under a proper
construction of the acts of 1895 the county
wax entitled to retain the whole amount of
stich penalties and percentages and that the
same had, through mistake and error, been
paid into the State treasury. Attorney Gen
eral U. S. Webb, on behalf of the State, con
tended that, under the acts of 1895, this
money had been properly paid into the State
treasury, and that the county was not en
titled to recover. The case was argued be-,
fore Judge Hughes at Sacramento on May 23
and ' by the court taken under advisement.
The decision rendered this morning sustains
the State's contention In every particular.
The decision Is of great importance to the
State and to the various counties because of
the feet that the Fame question exists In
every county In the State and the result of
this suit was being closely watrhed by the
other counties and, had plaintiff been suc
cessful, doubtless a similar suit would have
been commenced In every county In the State.
Attorney General Webb received a
telegram yesterday announcing that
Superior Judge Hughes of Sacramento
had rendered a decision in favor of the
State- in the suit brought by Auditor
Honeycutt of Madera County against
Controller E. P. Colgan to recover the
amount of penalties accruing from the
sale of property for/delinquent taxes.
The amount of money involved is far in
excess of Jl.OOO.OOG, according to the es
timate of State officials. Attorney.Gen
eral Webb made the following state
ment of the case yesterday:
The history of the Rancho el Pesca
dero antedates the coming of Commo
dore Sloat to California. The Mexican
Government granted it in 1840 to Fa
bian Bareto and thirteen years later It
passed by successive transfers to the
late John C. Gore, senior, father of the
present plaintiff. The elder Gore con
veyed his rights to his son in 1862.
Merely to mention all the points in
the present complicated litigation
would fill columns. In brief, the com
plainants allege that Gore senior, In
I860, gave tp F. Z. Seymour of Boston
a power of attorney to sell the ranch
for "unincumbered Eastern property
worth $33,000"; that Seymour made a
contract with one Tompkins of Bing
hamton, N. Y., to exchange it for
property there which Mas mortgaged
for more than it was worth; that Gore
repudiated this trade and refused to
execute a deed, but that Tompkins,
acting on Seymour's contract, came to
California and took possession. In 1862
Tompkins quitclaimed to Jacks, who
succeeded, in 1868, in getting the Gov
ernment to issue a patent to him. All
of Jacks* rights in the estate were sold
in 18S0 to the Pacific Improvement
Company.
In the present action the plaintiffs
allege that they did not learn of the
patent to Jacks \intll a few months
ago. Their bill of complaint sets forth
a list of alleged fraudulent acts of Sey
mour, Tompkins and Jacks whereby the
younger Gore alleges he was kept out
of possession. To this bill the defend
ants demurred on the ground, among
other things, that the complainants
had slept on their rights and Judge
Morrow held that the suit had no
standing in equity.
The Pacific Improvement Company,
which is the real defendant in the case,
is better known as the owner of the
splendid Monterey" Hotel property, of
the Pacific Grove Waterworks and of
much real estate at Pacific Grove and
Monterey besides the ranch over which
runs the seventeen-mile drive. The
plaintiff Gore is a collector for the
Spring Valley Water Company. How
ard is a prominent attorney of Detroit,
Mich.
The United States Supreme Cdurt is
to be asked to pass upon the title to
the great Rancho el Pescadero, lying
south of Monterey and including with
in its 4438 acres the famous seventeen
mile drive. The property is now held
by the Pacific Improvement Company,
which purchased it from David Jacks,
one of the leading land owners of the
coast and former grantee of a patent
from the Government. Both Jacks and
the company, together with the United
States of America, are named as de
fendants in a suit for reformation of
the patent, instituted early this year
by John C. Gore and Hamilton Gay
Howard, who claim that the vast es
tate rightfully belongs to them. This
action was dismissed recently by Unit
ed States Circuit Judge Morrow, who
held the suit was* barred by the plain
tiffs' laches and by the statute of lim
itations. From this judgment appeal
is now taken to the highest Federal
court.

"I returned from the country last .
Tuesday." he said, "and on Wednes- .
day as I was going up Post street, on
my way to where I live on Powell
street, I was very much distressed to
notice Goldman following me and mo
tioning frantically. I shook my head
at him very decidedly, in order that
the movement could be perceived by
a man at that distance, but he con
tinued following me until I sought rest
in a drug store at Post and Powell
streets, as I was very much exhausted.
There Â¦were several chairs in the store,
and as I sat down in one of them Mr.
Goldman entered and occupied an
othor. He immediately began to cate
chize me, asking where I had moved
my lodgings and if my daughter ac
companied me". To all his questions
I objected, and when I tried to get
away from him he followed me to the
door. This was repeated several times,
. he paying no attention to my protests,
but at last he left of his own accord.
I explained the matter to the propri
etor of the ptore. Goldman stayed in
the store about ten or twelve minutes.
"The second time he followed me
was yesterday morning. I left my
l"dgrings. at 407 Powell street, about
10 o'clock, and after looking around
to see if the coast was clear I walked
down Post Mreet until I stopped to look
at something in the window of Elder's
book store. Hearing a guttural sound
immediately behind me I turned
around. It was Goldman again, and I
received a severe mental shock. He
started to speak to me, but uttered no
intelligible word, as my face evidently
look unutterable things. I went into
the book store and stayed there until
he went away. Now I have only to
say that I do not feel safe, and my
respect for law is very much jarred.
"Why?" asked the Judge.
"Because if I should make away
with this man in self-defense, I feel
that I would be taking the place of the
law and the courts."
During the complainant's recital
Goldman repeatedly shouted, in a
shrill tenor, "I did not! I did not!"
His attorney warned him to maintain
silence. Then he protested that he
did not follow Snow on either of the
occasions named, but met him by ac
tident, and went into the drug store
merely to assure him that he did not
desire to do him any harm. "I
though he would feel better if I told
him I would not harm him again,"
said Goldman, "and I did not ask him
where he lived or mention his daugh
ter's name." t
"I'll set this case for hearing next
Monday morning." said the Judge,
""and if, in the meantime, this defend
ant follows the complaining witness,
speaks to him or casts side glances at
him, I will have the defendant brought
into court."
Snow looked weak and pale as he
told his story, and not once 'did he al
low his eyes to meet the appealing
glances of Goldman, who was consid
erably excited. Goldman's bail of
$1000 was not increased.
Miss Claribel David made her de
but and a decided hit as a professional
pleader when she secured dismissal of
the battery' charge on which Attorney
Joseph T. Cognet was tried before
Judge Conlan. Other names besides
hers were on the calendar as repre
senting the defense, among them be
ing: Attorneys Delmas, Campbell,
Ruef, Fhortall and Spinetti, but she
alone defended. Nor was the prose
rution beaten for lack of legal talent,
as Judge Ferral had the assured aid
in the event that he should call for it,
of such distinguished jurists as Ford,
Taafe, Quinlan and German Interpre
ter Bexcey. Judge Ferral did not
summon assistance, however, evident
ly appreciating the hopelessness of do
ing such a thing in the face of the
facts and the opposing odds.
A gas bill was at the bottom of the
case. J. D. McCarthy, a collector for
the artificial illumination monopoly,
railed at the residence of the defend
ant and a wordy altercation over the
sum mentioned in the bill developed
into an exchange of blows. It was
Cognet who received most physical
punishment, because he was by many
years the senior and by many pounds
the lighter of the combatants, and it
"was he who blew the whistle that
brought the police. Yet he was the
defendant and McCarthy the.^ com
plainant, a fact which provoked some
logical and eloquent pleading from his
fair counsel. While all the other le
gal lights in the case treated it with
more or less levity, she gave it ample
measure of seriousness. When her
client was under examination and his
French accent and graphic gesture
kept the attorneys' table agrin the
modern Portia never cracked a smile,
but deftly steered him around the
numerous pitfalls laid by the shrewd
opposition. And at the conclusion of
H. W. Snow, the former Mayor of
Oakland, who was shot by Adolph
Goldman on June 13 in the Clarendon
Hotel, took the witness stand in Police
Judtre Mogan's court yesterday morn
ing :ind said that since his release
from the hospital where his wounds
wore treated he has twice been pur
sued and accosted by Goldman and
that he fears for his life. Goldman
was arraigned yesterday for assault
with intent to commit murder, and his
attorney, Frank G. Murphy, asked for
a continuance till n^xt Monday. Then
the prosecuting attorney, Mr. Greeley.
announced that the complaining wit
ness had something to say to the court,
and Snow was invited to take the
stand.
William Waldron of 205 Natoma
street addressed 'uncomplimentary lan
guage to the mother of Piper Partee,
a Pullman car porter, and the son re
sented the insult to his maternal rela
tive by breaking WaldYo-n's jaw. Par
tee was arrested and charged with bat
tery, but after hearing the facts Judge
Conlan dismissed the case.

The preliminary examination of Ar
thur Williams and James H. Smith,
the colored non-union stablemen
charged with the murder of Owen Gal
lagher, a union stableman, during a
free fight at Polk street and Cedar ave
nue on June 25, was begun before Po
lice Judge. Fritz, -a number of wit
nesses were examined for the prosecu
tion, but their evidence did not differ
from that given at the Coroner's in
quest. Further, testimony will be taken
on Monday morning, â Â¦

Charles Rose and Robert Horton,
juvenile tourists from Milwaukee, were
armed with loaded revolvers when
Patrolman Skain overhauled ' them at
2 o'clock yesterday morning on the
Barbary Coast. They pleaded fear of
attack by footpads, as before leaving
home they were- warned that San
Francisco is a "robbing town." To
which Judge Mogan said:
"Tut. tut, Charles and Robert While
in San Francisco you can leave your
shooting irons in your trunks with im
punity. We have some robbing here,
'tis true, but the percentage of it ac
companied by violence is trifling. Even
in your own city, made famous by its
beer, I understand that most of the
pilfering is done by politicians. Go
your way and don't believe all you
hear about the 'toughness* of San
Francisco."
An additional charge of horse-steal
ing was filed against Raoul de Costa,
on trial before Judge Mogan for pur
loining, a team belonging to the Has
lett Warehouse Company. The second
complaint was sworn to by W. W. An
derson of 844 Geary street and set
forth that on May 23 the gentleman
with the .society drama cognomen did
feloniously take and drive away one
harnessed horse, also a buggy. Both
cases were continued till next Tues
day and the detectives say that before
then they will have more charges of
the same kind to fasten on Raoul.
James Duffs', accused of stealing a
roll of blankets and an overcoat from
underneath a pool table upon which
their owner was punching the ivories
in a Third-street saloon, informed
Judge Mogan that he would like to
have "Dublin Dan," "Deaf Murphy,"
"Billy the Boxer" and "Pete the Bar
keep," proper names unknown, subpe
naed to aid him in proving an alibi.
Subpenaes accordingly issued.
While the Radcliffe case was on hear
ing in Judge Fritz's court one of the
spectators abandoned his chair in the
front row, and among those who
sprang to get possesion of it were Dong
tJong and Jerome Millard. rival Chinese
interpreters. Dong was first to reach
the seat, but ere he could squat he was
rudely seized and thrust away by Mil
lard, who used such violence that Dong
went spinning among the attorneys.
Bailiff Conlan immediately hauled Mil
lard before the Judge, who gave him
twenty-four hours' imprisonment for
contempt of court. Then Dong took the
empty chair.
Miss Ella Sherabi and Miss Bessie
Shattuck, young girls in conventional
bicycling costume, had Ah Lean, a Chi
nese teamster, before Judge Conlan on
a charge of battery, and they testified
that he deliberately ran his wagon into
the tandem wheel they were riding on
Folsom street, between Fourth and
Fifth, one day last week. The riders
were thrown to the pavement with such
violence that Miss Sherabi had to be
taken to the Receiving Hospital.
For the defense appeared Mrs. Sen
senbrenner and Mrs. Miller, who testi
fied that they had seen the collision and
that the bicycliennes were responsible
for it, as they ran their wheel into the
wagon. Xelther of the matrons went to
the injured girl's assistance, but both
of them went voluntarily to court to
testify in the Chinaman's behalf.
The case was continued till to-day,
when Captain of Police Spillane, who
made the arrest, may cast some new
light on it.
Judge Fritz held Harry Radcliffe to
answer in the Superior Court on a
charge of murder. Radcliffe was arrest
ed on the morning of June 26 and
charged with murdering Andrew Riley,
a hodcarrier, at Ninth and Sheridan
streets. The preliminary examination
brought out no important facts other
than were adduced at the Coroner's in
quest.
In a moment Monsieur Cognet was
delightedly shaking the Judge's hand
and complimenting him upon his keen
prescience, complete knowledge of
law and infallible sense of justice.
And a moment later Monsieur Cognet
was in the midst of a crowd of attor
neys, all of whom were showering him
with congratulations most enthusias
tic. Even then, in the proud flush of
her first profesional triumph, Miss
Claribel David maintained the digni
fied composure that marked her de
portment throughout the trial. She
quietly gathered up her law books,
shook the hand of Monsieur Cognet
and withdrew.
the testimony she made such a con
vincing argument that the court hung
breathlessly upon her words.
"It's an outrage," she concluded,
"that such a strong, able-bodied young
man as this complainant should strike
a feeble old man like my client."
"May it please the court," was
Judge Ferral's confession of over
whelming defeat, "I have no reply to
make to the argument of. my accom
plished sister in law."
Then the Judge summed" up to the
effect that the defendant merely in
dulged in illustrative gesture when
the blow fell that Mr. McCarthy ac
cepted as a willful assault. "We must
make allowance," said his Honor, "for
the defendant's irrepressible habit of
swinging his hands while he is talk
ing and give him the benefit of the ex
isting doubt as to whether his strik
ing of the complainant was really in
tentional. The case is dismissed."

In the first annual match between
English and Scotch professional golfers
played at Prestwick, Scotland, in June,
1903, Scotland beat England by the
narrow margin of nine ; matches to
eight. The second annual match,
played last month on the ' Sandwich
course, proved more exciting than the
first. Scotland obtained a lead of two
matches in the singles, but lost the
lead in the foursomes, and were 1
down with only one match to come in.
The last Scotch couple, Andrew Kirk
aldy and Ben Sayers, averted defeat for
the Scotch, Kirkaldy running down a 1
long put on the seventeenth green and
winning the match. Harry Vardon led
the English and James Braid the Scot
tish team. Vardon's card for the. first
round read 6, 3, 3, 5, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4; total,
35; and Braid's score was 5, 3, 3, 4, 3,
4, 5, 3, 5; total, 35. At theMenth hole
Vardon took the lead, but lost ' the
eleventh, and, the last seven holes be
ing halved, the match ended all square.
Vardon's medal play. '_score for. the
eighteen holes was 72 and Braid's was

On the course of the San Rafael Golf I
Club there, will be Scotch foursomes
over eighteen holes, medal play, for
men, to-day, one round to be played in
the morning, beginning at 10 o'clock,
and the other in the afternoon. Part
ners are to be assigned and then handi
capped. The prizes for the winning
pair are two handsome silver cups,
presented by C. A. Belden. Among
those who will compete are R. J. Davis,
a A. Belden, G. M. Pinckard, R. B.
Hellman and F. H. Green.
It is not possible 'at present, during
the dry season, , to do much work on
the new course of the San Francisco
Golf Club at Ingleside, but the grass
will be Curned to prepare the ground
for the first rains. It is believed an
excellent course can be laid out on the
track at Ingleside and that a good
turf can be grown there. /
Although many of the club members
are out of town the green at Golden
Gate Park is much too small to ac
commodate the numerous Scottish
bowlers who congregate there on Sat
urday afternoons. The players are
forced to wait their turn and early in
the afternoon only doubles are played.
Despite the fact that the popularity of
the same is on the increase there is a
surprising lack of interest in the tour
naments under way. Both were start
ed several months ago, but the players
do not get together. The doubles
event should have been completed
last Saturday but as yet- the semi
final round has not been played.. The
match which was set for last Satur
day will be played to-day. The con
testants will be W. It. Eaton and Dr.
Hamilton and James Mearns and
Thomas McNaught. The winner of this
match will meet Maxwell Crowe and J.
M. Duncan in the finals next Saturday.
The contestants in the semi-final
match are evenly matched and a close
contest will result when they meet.
Many of the players think Dr. Hamil
ton and Eaton will, carry off the hon
ors but the other men have bowled
well throughout the tournament.
The singles tournament is in a more
chaotic state even than the doubles.
Defaults nave greatly outnumbered
matches actually played and it be
gins to look as If the tournament
would be abandoned. The lack of
success of this tournament is un
doubtedly due to the fact that the
names 'of, "all the club members were
drawn. Some had" no intention of
playing, * and many are out of town,
and consequently, only a few matches
have been played." . In the doubles
tournament only those competed who
entered their names.
The victory of the Oakland bowlers
on Monday was a surprise. In the two
previous . meetings the home bowlers
won with ease and the visitors were
hardly, conceded to -have a chance.
The Oaklanders have been practicing
constantly' and the "fifth and deciding
match" will be a" hard-fought affair.
On No.- 1 rink -the-San Francisco bowl-
The tournament last week proved
conclusively that Herbert Long, and
Clarence Griffin, are easily the most
promising young players in the vicinity
of San Francisco. Considering it was
Long's first appearance, at San Rafael
his showing was remarkable. While
Griffin does not possess as much. skill
as Long he has other qualities that are
essential to successful tournament
play. â¢ ....... Vh
Since 1901 every coast championship
event has been won by players from
Southern California. Last year Percy
Murdock and Grant Smith came close
to beating Champion Bell. This year
the outlook is even better. Murdock
has improved since the last tournament
and MacGavin has. come to the front
as a likely candidate.' Smith will not
participate but MacGavin and Mur
dock will make ,a combination the
champions will â¢ find hard to beat.
Smith intended to play In the doubles
with MacGavin but the match with
MacGavin last Monday made it evi
dent to the ex-champion that any
further play this year would result s in
permanent Injury to his health. Smith
and MacGavin have ranked second as
a doubles team for three years and
each year have succumbed only to the
champions. As Freeman will not play
in Sqptembar the home players could
probably annex the championship, this
year with little difficulty. Smith may
get into shape by next year but It Is
doubtful if he will ever play in a tour
nament again. ... â¢
Now that the San Francisco. and the
State tennis championships have been
decided tournament play wijl be re
sumed on the* courts. With the coast
championship events" less than two
months. away the players will put in
every spare moment before the nets.
Both the California and the Golden
Gate clubs are planning tournaments
for a week from to-morrow. On the
courts of the former club the v sixth
handicap doubles tournament for the
Directors' cups will be held. The first
and second class men will meet in cup
contests on the public courts at the

The racing length of the Corinthian
was not determined, as her jib was to
be altered, so that the exact area of
the canvas could not be obtained. The
measurers met again on Thursday and
found her racing length to be feet.
On Tuesday F. Stone and Dave Dean
sailed the Corinthian from Tiburon to
the city front and back.
The Judges' boat to-day will be either
the steamer Sunol or the Resolute. It
will be at the Powell-street wharf at
11:30 in the morning. The preparatory
gun will be fired at 12:30 p. m.. the
yachts being allowed two minutes
within which to cross the line without
penalty. The stakeboat off Angel Is
land, three miles due north from the
Powell-street wharf, is the first mark
and will be F. Stone's sloop Presto;
the sloop Surprise, will be \he Blos
som Rock stakeboat. " The starting-line
at the end of Powell-street wharf will
be marked at one end by a launch and
at the other by a Whitehall.
The 'opinion is frequently heard
among yachtsmen that heavy weather
will suit the Challenser best and that
a light breeze will favor the Corinthian.
As it is low water at Fort Point at 1:33
p. m., the first part of the race will
be sailed on an ebb tide and the last
part on a flood. It is problable that thÂ»
water will be smooth under these cir
cumstances. It is reasonable to suppose
that the Corinthians, before they sent
In the challenge at such a date that the
race would take place in July, when
the winds are strongest, had satisfied
themselves as to the performances of
their boat in a hard blow. The smooth
water is generally admitted to be fav
orable to the Corinthian's chances. It
is said that in Eastern waters the
yachts of the scow type prove faster
than the fin-keel craft.
The tenth annual race for the Wal
lace trophy of the California Yacht
Club will be sailed to-morrow, the
course being: from the Oakland broad
gauge mole to and around Presidio
Shoal buoy, distant six nautical miles,
leaving it on the port hand; thence
back to the starting point, passing
Goat Island on the port hand â a beat
out and a run home. Preparatory gun
will be fired at 11:10 a. m. for a ons
gun start. All yachts in the club are
considered as entered and light sails
may be carried. A launch will con
vey the regatta committee, consisting
of A. Vekander, W. H. James and A.
H. Bauerle, partly over the course.
The trophy ia at present held by the
sloop Thelma. which won It last year.
The proposed handicap race of the
Corinthian yachts from Vallejo to
Tiburon on the Fourth was not held.
The yachts were too much scattered
during the holidays and some of them
encountered a hard blow off Collins
vllle-, which was passed under double
reefs. The yacht Emma was towing
Bush Fennell's launch, but it made the
sloop so unhandy that it was cut adrift
in the dark. Next day some fishermen
came along with the launch in tow. re
ceiving $20 for its salvage. E. F.
Sager's Edna did not reach Vallejo till
10 o'clock Monday morning, owner and
crew being too tired to want to race
a few hours later.
. The two racing boats were measured
on Tuesday at the Fulton Iron Works
by W. W. Farrar, measurer of the Â§an
Francisco Yacht Club and by Georg â¢
W. Harrold, measurer of the Corin
thian Yacht Club. The sail area of the
Challenger Is 964.26 square feet, the
square root of which is 31.05; this added
to 26.15. the length on the water-line,
gives a total of 57.20, which, betnsr
halved, gives 2S.6O as the racing length.
The racing length of the Challenger
in 1902 was 2S.3S. which, for the calcu
lation of time allowance, is the same
as 2S.60.
Yachting enthusiasts will be on hand
to-day to view the great race between
the flnkeel sloop Challenger of th$ San
Francisco Yacht Club and the center
board racing scow of the Corinthian
Yacht Club for the San Francisco
perpetual challenge cup.
In this race the Corinthian is the
challenger and the Challenger la the
defender. The Challenger will be
sailed by W. G. Morrow, commodore
of the San Francisco Yacht Club. His
crew will consist of R. S. Bridgman.
J. C. Cockerill, W. W. Haley. Harry
Helen. W. W. Farrar and Hil'.yer
Deuprey.
Frank Stone is captain of the Cor
inthian, his crew being made up of
Douglas Erskine. J. Short. Neill Mc-
Lean. J. C. Brickell. .F. E. Schober
and Commodore T. Jennings. Allen M.
Clay of the California Yacht Club will
referee. The race is under the manage
ment of the regatta committees of the
two clubs, the San Francisco â¢ repre
sentatives being Dr. T. L. Hill (In the
stead of R. S. Brldgman. who is sail
ing on the Challenger). Roy C. Ward

bers being T. J. Kavanaugh. J. K.

Budd Doble, who drove Dexter, Gold

a couple of keepsakes from C. K. G.
Billings last week which he prizes high
ly. They were one of the hind shoes
which Lou Dillon wore when she made
her world's record of lrSS 1 ,* at Memphis
and a neat gold-plated pin made from
one of the nails which held the shoe In
place on that memorable day. Mr. Do
ble has had them mounted in an appro
priate frame, leaving the shoe Just as
it came from the hoof of the champion
mare, without nickle plate or other
adornment. The shoe is only a thin
plate, and placed alongside the shoes
worn by Goldsmith Maid and Nancy
Hanks shows a striking contrast. The
Goldsmith Maid shoe weighs ten
ounces, the Nancy Hanks shoe three
si nd a quarter ounces, while the Lou
Dillon shoe weJg-hs but two ounces.
Two weeks from Wednesday next the
California circuit will open at Pleas

there will be the Occident stake, worth

Hi Hogoboom has a McKinney colt
in his string at San Jose, owned by C.
L. Jones of Modesto, that must be con
sidered, as he trotted an easy mile in
2:22 six weeks ago, while Frank H.
Burke's filly Wanda II. by McKinney,
out of the old favorit*. Wanda, 2:1494,
is looked upon as one capable of equal
ing her dam's record this year. Among
those that will be backed for this stake
is the filly Geraldine. by Zombro. owned
by W. H. Coleman of Los Angeles and
trained bv the popular driver Walter
Maben. There will be a load of money
played on this filly to win by the south
ern contingent. The outlook at present
is for a field of eight or ten starters,
with the favorite at least two to one in
the betting.
Payments were made January 2 of
this year on fifty-four colts and fillies
in this stake, and allowing 50 per cent

enough trotters remaining to make the
Make one of the greatest, numerically,
that has ever been given in California.
Among those that have shown winning
Â£IÂ»?ed is the chestnut colt by Prince
Ansel, dam Nosegay, owned by Alex
Brov.n of the Walnut Grove Stock
Farm. Charley Spencer is training this
colt at Pleasanton, and is reported to
have worked him miles below 2:18 on
several occasions.
Almaden. a handsome black colt
owned by C. A. Durfee of Oakland,
won the two-year-old division of this
Ftake last year, getting a record of
2:22*i at Petaluma. where the race
was decided. Almaden is naturally
the favorite for the three-year-old di
vision this year and as he has worked
heats better than 2:19 and is known
to be a game and consistent colt,
the confidence in his -ability is not
misplaced. News comes from San
Jose, however, where the colt is in
training, that Almaden has not been
right and a lameness in one hio ne
cessitated his being thrown out of
training for a while. A seton was put
in, which is treatment of ,the heroic
order, and it is said the colt is going
pound again, although far behind in
condition and training for a. race that
will come off during the first week in
August.
Not since the memorable campaign
of 1895, when Zombro, matchless son
of the great trotter McKlnney. 2:11%,
and Stam B, best of the get of the su
perb Stambonl. 2:07%, fought for su
premacy through the Pacific Coast
circuit, has so much interest been
uroused over three-year-old trotters
as is manifest this season. Zombro
won forty heats that year, a record
that has never been equaled since, He
went into winter quarters with a rec
ord of 2:13. while Stam B beat every
horse that beat him and closed the
reason with a mark of 2: 15 Vs. Zom
bro afterward reduced his record to
":I1 rind the son of Stamboul is only
a quarter of a second behind him in
point of speed. While it may not com' 1
about that the California three-year
olds of 1904 will class with Zombro
and Stam B, the outlook at present
is that some high class young trotters,
will be seen in the three s^*eat threc
> ear-old events that, are down for de
cision. The first to be trotted will be
the Pacific Breeders' Futurity, a stake
inaugurated by the Pacific Coast Trot
ting Horse Breeders' Association. This
Ftake is guaranteed to be worth $6000
and as this is the initial contest there
is great rivalry among breeders and
owners over the outcome. â¢

have the right to lease* the land only
on condition that the buildings erected
thereon be used for park purposes.
Harper wants the land for some amuse

"The charges are too preposterous to
deserve serious attention," says J.
Bottomly. secretary of the Marconi
Telegraph Company, in regard to the
suit riled against that corporation in
the Supreme Court by Henry Gardner.
The complainant demands an injunc
tion restraining the directors from dis
posing of its assets and asks that a re
ceiver be appointed for the company.
In the complaint Gardner alleges that
he is a stockholder, but Secretary
Bottomly denies emphatically that
there is any such man as Henry Gard
ner, among the stockholders of the com
pany. *
"The charges of_miBmanagement are
so wild and silly," said the secretary,
"as to make it perfectly plain that the
person who drafted the complaint was
entirely without information regarding
the affairs of the Marconi Company
and 'was pimply seeking to injure it
The company is in a very prosperous
condition, and these charges were no
doubt instJgatr-d by rival companies."
Secretary Says That Charges of
"Henry Gardner" Were Invest I- '
by Jealous Rivals.

The members of th% Supervisors' po
lice, committee visited the gymnasium
of the Yosemite Club yesterday in the
annex of the Mechanics' Pavilion. All
the accoutrements of a well-appointed
gymnasium were inspected and sever
al members of the organization were
seen in action at the punching bag,
sand bag and other devices.
One of the requirements in the box
ing ordinance is that any club giving
a professional boxing exhibition must
have a gymnasium. The visit thereto
was made in" connection with the
granting of the August permit which
the majority of the police committee
has recommended be given to the
Hayes Valley Club on the ground that
it was the only one having a gymna
sium. The fact that the Yosemite Club
has a gymnasium may cause the com
mittee to alter its recommendation,
thus allowing the club to promote the
Jeffries-Munroe contest for which it
has posted a forfeit of $2500.

Being Compiled With.

VAN HALTKEN'S GREAT CATCH.
- TACOMA, July 8. â Jones \ again
proved easy for the Tigers to-day. He
had nothing in his repertoire they
could not hit. They ran bases until
they were tired and made Uncle
Henry's men look like amateurs.
Keefe was in fine form and but for er
rors San Francisco would not. have
scored. The first three innings were
good baseball and then the Tigers be
gan to get on to Jones. A run in the
fourth and another in the fifth were
followed by McLaughlin's home run
in the sixth, scoring himself and Lynch.
This was the second home run of the
season over the right field fence. In
the seventh San Francisco came within
one of tying the score. This put gin
ger into the Tigers, ,who went for Jones
like a lot of Indians. Five singles,
Doyle's three-bagger with the bas^s
full, together with a couple of gifts
and a sacrifice scored seven runs.
Thirteen men faced Jones in the inn-
Ing. In the eighth McLaughlin's sin
gle. Keefe's two-bagger and singles by
Doyle and Sheehan scored two more.

Mayor Weaver Takes a Firm
Stand Keorardinjr the Fitz-
Pretty Polly has won all her starts
this year and has never been extended.
As Major Eustace Loder, her owner, is
a thorough sportsman the .match
seems more than a possibility.
Pretty Polly is a daughter of Galli
nule. She Is chestnut in color and
stands sixteen hands one Inch high.
With all this height she is a beauti
fully turned thoroughbred. She made
a sorry example of her rivals In the
Oaks. They did not seem able to gallop
fast enough to hustle her out of a brisk
canter. St. Mlndred was beaten off a
quarter 6t a mile, and her jockey was
asked Ironically, "Where have you
been?"
Englishmen concede that in no year
within two score and ten has there
been such a marvel seen as th* brilliant
daughter of Gallinule.
Americans almost to a unit say that
in no year within the memory of man
has there been in this land the equal of
the brilliant Beldame. Peerles as Bel
dame is here. Pretty Polly is considered
equally eo on the other side of the
ocean. Pretty Polly has conquered all
England. Beldame has swept America
with her prowess. Each is invincible in
her own country. Each is seeking con
quests new.
Beldame is the property of August
Belmont. but her racing qualities are
leased to Newton Bennington. in whose
colors she is racing. She Is a chestnut
filly by Octagon-Belladonna. Possibly
her greatest performance was her sec
ond to the five-year-old Hermis last
Saturday. The mile was run in 1:3S.
Although Beldame was interfered with
ehe was beaten but one length by the
Thomas horse, to whom she was con
ceding two years in age.
The sportsmen of this country and of
England axe discussing p. race the pos
sibility of which has stirred up more
interest than any match since the mem
orable meeting of Salvator and Tenny
at Sheepshead Bay,
The proposal has been made that
Beldame and Pretty Polly, the greatest
three-year-old fillies, respectively, of
America and of England, meet in a
special match in September after they
have fulfilled their season's engage
ments. It is proposed that the battle
ground of this equine duel be left to
chance and that it be decided by the
toss of a coin.

* PORTLfAND," July 8.â Pitcher Roach i

gilt-edged delivery prevented the visit

whack at the bail, in the ninth that
scored. the lone winning run. , .'. . i
Toman at second had his mitt'.on the
ball, but it was coming so fast he jug- !
gled and the Brown pitchbr beat the
throw to first. This was in the ninth.
Nadeau had singled and had j stolen
second. Beck hit. safely; but Raymond,
forced him out at .Second. Raymond
went as far as second on Castro's sin
gle.f iThen Shea was given a pass: Dug
dale made a feint at this point of put
ting in Thielman to bat for Roach. As
it turned out Roach had a "chance to
add to his honors, for it was then hie
lined the hot one 1 to Toman, while the
latter fielded the 'ball to first before
Raymond came home.
Â¦ Ix>s Angeles got a man as far-as-sec
ond twice during the game and Na
deau's, two-bagger helped . him as far

BRIGHTON BEACH. X. Y.. July 8.â
1'eeause the racepoing public has
yearned for weeks to see a high-class
two-year-old, the fact that H. B. Dur
yea's brown filly Iota, by Sandringham
out of dementia, was to start in the
last race at Brighton Beach to-day
was of more than usual interest. It
".a* known she was a good one, but
the problem was. would she run
Â¦ sreen." or would she do as Bumble
Hee did and spreadeagle her field? *
The feld moved av.ay from the bar
rier with Icta last, or next to last. She I
seemed hopelessly out of it until half
way round the turn. Nightmare was
the par*Â»maker for half a mile, when
rhe retired in favor of Salt and Pep
per. The latter looked a winner when
the shouts pt the spectators called
attention to the green and white
Jacket of Jockey Hildebrand on Iota.
Â£he had gone around the field of horses
on the outside, where the going was
pood, and rajiidly overhauled Salt and
Pepper, winning under restraint. Linda
I^ee. under a hard drive all around the
turn, was third. Intrigue was inter
fered with at one stage of the race.
The time, l:0!Â», did not say much for
the class of those behind Iota. The lat
ter, however, won like a stake filly.
Cratches were numerous during the.
afternoon. The owners evident ry did
rot foresee how good the track would

CHICAGO,.July 8.â An ordinary card
was presented to a good-sized crowd
to-day at Harlem. The weather was
good, but the track was heavy. Prob
ably the best race of the afternoon was
the steeplechase over the short course,
in whkh nine started. All finished ex
cept Allegiance, which fell at the third
jump. lie then finished the course
riderless and ran four miles before
stopping. Creolin was favorite, but
secured no part of the money. Hand
vice at 15 to 1 won easily from John
E. Owens, which beat Cardigan only
a neck for the place. Moorish Damsel
was the only winning favorite. "Big
Bill" Knapp rode two winners.
John A. Drake wired J. G. Greener
to-day that he would not give $25,000
for Oiseau, and $10,000 more if he won
the Futurity, on account of his defeat
on the 4th inst. The offer of $20,000
cash still stands. It is believed here
that the son of Ornus- Kittle Gunn
will shortly be in the Drake barn. Sum

NEWS OF THE OCEAN*.
An important addition to the Pa
cific Coast fleet of carriers was made
yesterday morning when the new â
though not yet completed-^â steamer
Norwood came into this port. With
several months' work still to be done
on her and depending on the power of
a tugboat for motion she brought in
the largest cargo j>f lumber that has
ever entered San Francisco harbor.
One million one hundred and thirty
two thousand feet was her initial load.
The Norwood is 210 feet long, beam
33% feet, and she draws 14 feet of
water. She was built at Grays Har
bor at a cost of $125,000. The engines
which are being built for her will be
of 800 horsepower, and her speed will
be over ten and a half knots. She will
be fitted to carry forty cabin passen
gers. The interior of the cabin will be
of hardwood finish, in beautiful de
sign and rich display. The Norwood
is owned by Sudden & Christenson, 6
California street. She will run be
tween Grays Harbor, San Pedro, Port
Angeles and San Francisco.

The weather continued to bother Chicago
a good deal and that market rose from 84%c
to S5',4c and fell back to.84HÂ«'. The North
west bought freely. SnowV estimate gave the
condition of winter Wheat at 7S.2 and spring
Wheat at 91.7, or 375,000,000 bushels winter
Wheat and 300,000 bushels spring Wheat. The
Kansas rains continued the controlling feature
of the market and reports from Wichita said
that the damage In that region would be 40
per cent, and that the trade does not realize
the, seriousness ot the situation. Minneapolis
wired that it waÂ« raining everywhere In that !
district and that It must cease at once cr there
would bo serious damage.
This market showed no change, except that
futures were weaker. The cash grain con

There was little change yesterday. Butter
continued easy, with a liberally supplied mar
ket and some overstocked houses, as pre
viously mentioned, were willing to shade the
quotations to sell. The feeling in Cheese was
firm and the demand was very fair, but Ore
gon is still a large shipper into this market,
and receipts from California producers who
have lately been holding back their product,
are Increasing, so there la no scarcity. Outside
points, however, will not pay over 0c.
Eggs have again advanced. Receipts fell
off sharply yesterday, as will be seen, and
some houses report choice ranch actually

22 %c.
Receipts were 2.8.000 lbs Butter, 378 cases

Poultry} and Game.
NEW YORK, July 8.â The forces In the
market making for higher prices made a stand
to-day against the reaction that developed yes
terday and turned the course of prices upward
again. Support was in evidence from the
outset and although considerable selling to
realize had to be absorbed in the early deal
irpÂ». earning prices backward several times,
these offerings diminished and opened the way
for the late advance. The midday period was
decidedly dull and the movement of prices
indecisive either way. The events to which
1 yesterday's reaction was attributed continued
I in increased force to-day, but they proved
without effect on the direction of prices. The
support was derived from the sympathetic ef
fect of the strength of the local tra.ctton
stocks and the leaders of the week"s market
were conspicuoug buyers and bidders-up of
thes* stocks. With the impression thus created
that a leadership had been resumed for an
advance the relaxed. London afford
ed little assistance here, a feeling of disquiet
over the money situation providing something
of a burden for that market to carry. The re
ports overnight of the flood situation in the
Southwest were of a more serious complexion
than was the case yesterday and the drawing
out of the contest in the Democratic Con
vention might have aggravated the doubts
over the outcome, which were said to be an
influence in yesterday's reaction. But these
facts were ignored and no attention was paid
to the decided strength in the wheat market.
ThÂ»- upward movement, which spread through
out the etock market in the afternoon, had itÂ»
irtvption in Reading, which wa* lifted steadily
upward on the continued absorption of large
blocks of the stock. There was no apparent
news to account for the strength of this stock.
The ether coalers, however, made more mod- â¢
erate response in sympathy. The market was
h^Ii^ed by the very large irain In cash reserves.
Sub-treasury operations have contributed $5.
82.V*X> to the cash supply of the banks. This
Includes Government interest payments and
represents also the receipts of Klondike gold,
which have gained a considerable volume and
may be expected to furnish a source of ad
ditional supply for some time to come. Read
ing's two-point advance continued to lift the
market until the sliffht recessions just before
the closing on profit-taking. The closing waÂ«
therefore rather Irregular, but only slightly
below the best. - {
Bonds were firm. Total sales, par value,
$C. 870.000.
United States bonfis were unchanged on call.

'"The wtather during last week was varia
ble. The 2*th and 29th were very hot. after
vhich it turned cooler and good rains fell in
tfaa eastern sections, but none of coneequence
occurred Sn the western part cf the State. In
the Willamette Valley the drought â¢ontimies
and all late crops are FuJIering and badly need
rain. The fail grain harvest has Just begun
and it VtS become general in about a week.
The crop lc good nrarly everywhere, except
In the Grmnde Ronde and Powder River valleys.
Tvh*>re it vtr badly damaged by the frost of
last. week. The frost in that Â«ection was un
usually eevere. and. besidos damaging grain
In the head, it cut all tender vegetation to the
ground and injured considerable fruit. Spring
frrain is doing poorly, especially In the Wll-
IÂ«nvtte Valley and in Southern Oregon, where
it <s heading bo short that fears are entertained
that many flrlds will have to be cut for hay.
"Good progress has be^n made In harvest-
Jnp the hay crop, much of which is now eafe
3y secured. The yields are generally reported
light, et-petia.il>- timothy, which in a number
of localities turned out to be aJmort a failure.
Vetch yielded well and clover was but slightly
below the average. Hops, corn and potatoes
tit<:-d more rain; potatoes have Buffered the
most. Hops, although etill green, have not
thfir usual vigor at \his season of the year.
an-i the growers do not expect a full crop.

is reported, but otherwise all crops are re
markably free from insect pests. Ap;>les con-

The market for new Potatoes developed an
easier tone, as receipts were heavy and there
was nothing doing In the shipping line, all
orders having been filled on the preceding; day.
Small sales of whites were still reported at
$2 25 per cental, but there was not enough
sold at this figure to justify such a quotation.
It was stated that Seattle and other Puget
Sound ports have ceased baying here, as those
markets are being supplied with the home
grown article. Sweet Potatoes from Coachella
sold at 15c per pound. Good aound offerings
of red Onions were firm at unchanged rates,
but there were very few received and the
quotations were largely nominal. Silverskina
were plentiful and weak at a wider range of
prices.
The general tone of the market for mis
cellaneous vegetables was one of easiness, sup
plies of nearly all descriptions being far In
excess of the demand. Tomatoes declined
again under liberal arrivals and carried-over

as 25c per box. Green Peas and Lima Beans
were In limited supply and / steady, while
everything else was abundant and easy.

Fiesh Fruits and Vegetables are plentiful
and several kinds are cheaper this -week.
Huckleberries are offering, but they are rather
scarce and are beyond the purse of the aver
age buyer. Gooseberries have disappeared and
they are dropped from the list.
With the exception of Wild Doves, which
are cheaper all kinds of Poultry and Game
stand exactly the game as quoted last week.
Meats and Fish have changed but little.
Eggs are dearer. and sclll higher prices are
expected before long. Butter is still plentiful
and unchanged. >

Miss Lee Kue, Chinese cattle queen
of Arizona, Is in town. She arrived
unostentatiously and has taken up her
abode In the Chinese quarter. As yet
she has not shot out the lights of the
district nor has she attempted to dec
orate it with a carmine streak after
the custom of cattle queens of five
cent fiction. Miss Lee Kue is a most
peaceable and refined cowgirl. She left
her shooting irons at home near Phoe
nix, Arizona.
She is here on her way to China as
an escort to the ashes of her father,
who died several years ago and must,
according to custom, be buried in the
Flowery Kingdom. While Lee Kue is
thousands of years ahead of her own
race, she still clings to some of its tra
ditions. Therefore her father's last
wish will be religiously carried out.
Since she was fifteen. Lee Kue. has
had full charge of her father's ranch,
which brings an annual income of $10,
000. Every detail of its working was
managed by he,r., With a staff of ad
miring cowboys she superintended the
branding and the rounding up and she
rode with her own herds into Phoe
nix.
Her life contrasted almost grotesque
ly with that of her sisters here and in
China. While they seldom saw even
the little corners of .the world in which
they lived, all Arizona was Lee Kue's
to wander over. Her sisters covered
their faces from the sight of men. Lee
Kue goes forth among the sterner sex
of her own land and of America, jokes
with them, quarrels with them and
bargains with- them- shrewdly. While
her sisters toddle on their uncertain,
pyramid feet, Lee Kue leaps into the
saddle of a bucking mustang and
rides with the best cattle puncher in
Arizona.
Farming and horticulture are open
On the other hand the cattle queen
would hardly care for them. If she
brought Ah Kee or Fat Sung to Phoe
nix as her husband, his skin might
promptly be perforated by some of
Miss Lee Kue's narrow-minded admir
ers among the Alkali Ikes and Tucson
Charlies.
When Lee Kue returns from China
she will continue to manage the ranch.
If she decides to. take in a partner, he
will not be' led to the altar by his pig
tail. Lee Kue does not admire long
hair oh men. The fortunate husband
will be "all samee white man."
Marry a woman who rides astride
like a "white devil" upon a prancing
horse and no doubt has a Colt 45
cc-quettishly tucked away in her hip
pocket? Not for Ah Kee! Not for Fat
Sung! Not for any of the Beau Brum
mels of Chinatown!
Lee Kue is small and trim. Except
for the frank, fearless look in her
oblique eyes there is nothing*^n her
appearance to distinguish her from the
conventional Chinese girls cooped in
arbors of lilies and occupying their
time in wondering how the street be
low them looks. But the desert tan
of Arizona is on Lee Kue's cheeks and
now years of indoor life would never
make them pale. She belongs to the
strenuous Hfe.
Though Miss Lee Kue is an heiress,
she ls not regarded in Chinatown as
a matrimonial prize. She is so mar
velously "new" that the eligibles fear
her.
books to this Chinese girl of twenty.
Most of the markets in Phoenix are
provided with fruit and vegetables,
from her ranch. When the cattle were
not occupying all her attention she
would rise before dawn and drive a
four-horse wagon loaded with produce
into town.
The young ladies were quickly resus
citated, and a few hours later were
none the worse for their experience.
Two of the occupants, being unable
to swim, sank immediately. They
were Miss Corinne Lindstrom and Mrs.
S. S. Raymond of San Francisco. The
former was rescued by Miss Virginia
Goodsell, also of San Francisco, an
expert swimmer, who was bathing
near by. Mrs. Raymond would have
been drowned, but for the fact that
Dr. T. H. Morris of San Francisco,
who was in a boat near by, plunged in
without # stopping to remove his
clothes, dived to the bottom and
brought her to the surface.
The Russian river at Monte Rio was
the scene of what might have been a
fatal accident on the Fourth. The
guests at that resort were all assem
bled on the beach enjoying the
aquatic and other sports provided by
C. F. Carr, when the attention of the
crowd was attracted by screams from
the occupants of a boat in midstream.
The boat was upset through the care
lessness of two of the occupants, who
attempted to change positions. The
river was crowded with boats, to
which most of the unfortunates scram
bled.

Will Inspect Smoke Consumer.
The members of the Health and Hos
pital Committee of the Board of Super
visors will visit the Sanitary Reduction
Works next Wednesday morning for
the purpose of inspecting the new
smoke consumer installed in the plant.
A. Sbarboro, president of the cor
poration, notified the committee that
the foul odors heretofore disseminated
would be abolished by the new con
trivance.
These notes total $1,244,502 79. Before
the failure of the firm some reductions
made, as the books show that
when, on June 9, Topping surrendered
the books the firm owed but $1,105,
27S 82, a difference of $139,583 97.
Attorney Ach then moved to strike
out all evidence taken from the books
on the ground that Jacob Eppinger was
not directly connected with the entries.
The court denied the motion, and the
prosecution rested its case, with the
proviso that in view of the vast amount
cf testimony taken during the last
month it have the privilege of reopen
ing.
The defense has not as yet outlined
its case, but it will probably be based
on the contention tha.t if fraud were
committed it was without the knowl
edge of the defendant, who was ill and
paying but little attention to business.
Henry Wadsworth, trustee of the es
tate of Eppinger, bankrupt, began suit
yesterday in the United States District
Court to recover from Pauline Ep
pinger, the wife of Herman Eppinger,
a $50,000 policy of insurance issued on
June 6, 3889. on the life of Herman
Eppinger and alleged to have a paid-up
â¢value of $18,066.
The complaint charges that Herman
Eppinger assigned the policy to his
wife with intent to hinder, delay and
defraud his creditors. Wadsworth asks
the court to direct Pauline Eppinger
to assign the policy to him and to di
rect the life insurance company to ac
cept the assignment from Pauline to
himself.
W." "W. Topping, former bookkeeper
for the Eppingers. was again on the
stand. As a preliminary question At
torney Campbell asked the witness how
much the firm owed the London. Paris
and American Bank on April 14, 1903.
The question was objected to by Attor
ney Ach for the defense, and in reply
Campbell argued that the evidence
ehowed that every note of any conse
quence was paid, or payments were
made on it, by Jacob Epplnger.
'Was Jacob Eppinger the head of
the firm?" was asked.
â¢â¢Yes."
"Was the general financial business
cf the firm done by him?"
"Yes. He was the head of the firm,
and my orders as to the entries in the
books now in evidence came from him."
In answer to questions by Attorney
Campbell ihe witness then testified that
the following amounts were due banks
on 14, 1303:
London Paris and American. $339,700: Co
lusa. County itank. $132, 400: Isa&c Conn. $101.-
OOit; Angio-Califomian Bank. $e5.000; London
and Kan Krancisro. JS4.8O0; American Xa
tional. $02.000 Â¦ Comtoir d'Eseompte. $49,600;
Nevada National. $49,550; Wells -Fargo. $54,900;
San Francisco Savings Union SM.ROO; First
National Bank of Fresno. $13. S5O; First Na
tional Bank of Stockton, $12,500: Klrst Na
tional Bank of Oakland. $27M 78; Mrs. Ray
Vertneimer. JUXW; C. W. Clark, $11,471 71;
P Sweeney. $10C0; H. J. Schuman. $^532 60;
J. II Gl'.dp $12,076 45; Galland & Aaronson.
$10,000; Bank of Yolo $57.S>00; Bank of Wood
land $22.. '<74 II; International Banking Corpo
ration. $32.<Â«X>: Moses Blum. $4000.
The prosecution aimed to show yes
terday, by means of the note book of
the firm, that the Eppingers had bor
rowed money when they knew they
were hopelessly involved, also that
money v.as borrowed from one bank
and "'kited' over to another to bolster
up the credit of the tottering grain
dealers. The book showed that be
tween April 14 and June 9, 1903, the in
debtedness of the firm on notes had
been reduced almost $140,000, but this
elill left the Urm owing over a million
dollars, while new loans and renewals
of old ones had been solicited.
After a tedious day spent in the ex
amination of records, the prosecution
in the Eppinger case rested provision
ally yesterday afternoon. Monday
morning the defense will place its first
Â¦witness on the stand, but the attorneys
fcr Jacob Eppinger say positively that
they will occupy only a few days in
putting in their case and it will go be
fore ihe jury at the close of the com
ing week.
Aged Robert Allen's tragic death at
the hands of Buonorno Maranta, a fel
low patient at the City and County
Hospital, on June 29, was investigated
yesterday by Coroner Leland and a
jury. The story as told by the wit
nesses was to the effect that Maranta
was insane at the time he beat and
kicked the old paralytic to deaths and
at the same time the fact was devel
oped that in the absence of the attend
ants the patients have no means of
summoning help in case of fire or
other emergency.
After reciting that Allen was 72
year3 old, and that Maranta, while in
sane, killed him, the verdict reads as
follows:
We furthermore believe that the attendants
of the City Hospital were in no wise to blame,
and we believe the occurrence to have been
the rerun of a lack of facilitiesâ a bell sys
tem and lack of special rooms for special cases.
Allen was a paralytic and also af
flicted with deafnes3. He was con
fined at first in a large ward with other
patients, but was . so restless and
noisy that he was placed in a small
room downstairs where his cries could
not disturb the other patients. For a
similar reason Maranta was placed
with him. . Maranta was hysterical,
laughing and crying by turns, and he
often cot up from his cot and made
the rounds of the beds, shaking hands
with the patients and yelling, crying
and laughing at all hours of the day
and night. Both men were locked IVi
a room by themselves and were vis
ited at intervals by the nurse and the
physicians.
Coroner Leland called attention to
the fact that patients in such cases
had no means of summoning help in
case of fire or a sudden hemorrhage,
except by shouting for assistance and
taking chances of not being heard.
It leaked out in the testimony of the
female nurses that the orderly in
charge of the ward in which Allen and
Maranta had been confined had ab
sconded from the hospital with one
dollar that the patients had intrusted
to him for the purpose of buying
things for them. None of the wit
nesses could remember him by any
name other than that of "Eugene."
Maranta, hopelessly insane, has been
committed to the State Asylum at
Ukiah.
The last day of my life at 5 o'clock I got
up to lock for work, but in vain. I came
home and write these lines. I am done with
the world. I will receive information at 9
o'clock this evening and I will wait that long
to see whether I will get the place that was
premised me. 1 wrote to Montana last -week
for assistance but have not heard anything
yet. My local relatives are rather cold
toward me and are ashamed of me. I am
tired to live this way further and long for
rert. I was always modest and satisfied with
little and sought to help everybody when it
was In my power. Since three months I am
not well, which depresses me very much. Old
Â«KÂ« is coming on and many desire young peo
ple for work. I am ashamed to lay hands on
myrelf, but It in the only remedy. To-night
I viflted two places where I thought I was to
get something, but in vain, t will yet write
a few postal cards and then, farewell thou
beautiful vale of tears! Good-by to all.
f HERMAN' NICKEL.
Aftr telling his pitiful story in a let
ter and attempting to excuse the des
perate deed, Herman Nickel opened a
gas valve without lighting it in his
room at 67 Tehama street last Thurs
day evening. When found yesterday
morning he had been dead for hours.
The unfortunate man was 50 years old
and a native of Germany. He had oc
cupied the room for four years and had
been employed as a waiter until two
months ago. . Since then he had been
unable to find employment. He was a
member of Waiters' Union No. 30, and
that organization has taken charge of
his remains.

COMES AGAIN
INTO CUSTODY
Charles 3Iurray, Alias Kent
3Ioore, Who Escaped From
Folsom Prison, Captured
Charles Murray, alias Kent Moore,
who escaped from Folsom penitentiary
on May IS by dressing himself in the
clothing of a lineman, was arrested on
Church street yesterday afternoon by
Policeman George Weatherford while
trying to sell a horse and buggy that he
had stolen from the Mascot stables, at
1108 Golden Gate avenue. He was taken
to the Seventeenth-street station, where
he was identified by Policeman Connell,
who with Sergeant Sylvester arrested
him in May, 1903, on two charges of
grand larceny. He was removed to the
City Prison later and the Folsom au
thorities were notified.
He has a mania for stealing rigs.
On May 25, 1903. he stole a horse and
buggy from Kelly's stables, 1629 Pine
street, and four days later stole a rig
from the. Excelsior stables. 1000 Geary

Dunne's court on two charges of grand
larceny. On July 11. 1903, he was sen
tenced to serve ten years in Folsom
penitentiary, and made his escape on
May 18 last.
He tried to sell the rig he stole from
the Mascot stables yesterday to John
Shea, who lives at 215 Church street.
Murray was indignant at being arrest
ed and protested that the rig belonged
to him, but he subsided when Police
man Connell identified him at the sta
tion.
Murray has a bad record. He escaped
from a reform school in Illinois and
came to this State. He was soon ar
rested and was sent to the Preston Re
form School till he was 21 years of age.
After his discharge he returned to the
school and stole some machinery. He
came to this city and was arrested on
the two charges of grand larceny. He
is now 23 years of age.
