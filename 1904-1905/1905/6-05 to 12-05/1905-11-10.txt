"JACOB H. SCHIFF."
It is needless to explain to the community of San Francisco the na
ture of this dispatch. Day by day the newspapers have published the
horrible tidings of the wholesale massacre of Russian Jews. Whatever
the cause, tbe fact remains that^ thousands of people have been ruthlessly
butchered, hundreds of homes desolated, innocent women and children,
outraged, and conditions engendered which call for the resentment and
protest of the civilized world.- and particularly of the millions who in
the name of religion preach peace and humanity.
However, this is not the time for argument. Nor i> it the time for
mass-meetings. Xor is there sufficient time for a systematic canvass.
There is only time for aÂ« outpouring of. sympathy. Paramount is the
duty to help the sufferers. Widows and orphans, thousands of families
rendered homeless and helpless by the cruelties .practiced upon, them,;

The Jewish community, always able to help itself, stands appalled"
, in the face of this overwhelming calamity. .Millions arc needed to re
pair, in part at least, the injuries indicted by the infuriated mobs. Dozens
of Russian cities harbor Jewish communities which were yesterday
comfortable and prosperous and are to-day wholly desolate. In tliis ter-'
rible strait we are not ashamed to appeal to the compassionate regard
of all our neighbors. We are certain that San Francisco will not let this
appeal go unheeded. "

Delegates from the Jewish synagogues throughout the city and the

Emanu-El to consider the formulation of an appeal to the Jewish citizens
of California for financial aid for the oppressed Jews in Russia. The ap
peal was iÂ£sued by the delegates last night and the first response came
from Daniel Meyer, who subscribed JlOOO, and A. Aarbnson followed with
a gift of $500. Many others present at the meeting also pledged themselves
to give liberal sums.
The principal delegates came from this city and Oakland and the meet

evening: was Jacob Greenebaum. Inpresenting the appeal to the public the

is endeavoring to create a diversion of the public mind from its own miser

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. io.â A cablegram to the Times
from St.* Petersburg. says: "I hear that the question of autonomy
or Poland has been decided in the affirmative."
ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 9.â This city was in a furor of excitement all of
yesterday, and late into the night over "the news of the mutiny at Kronstadt.
Every one of the exaggerated reports of the affair received credence in many
-quarters, and half the Inhabitants of the capital believed that the mutiny was
successful;, that the troops, sent from here had joined in the revolt: that the
entire : garrison of St. Petersburg, would follow suit to-day; that the town of
: Krongtndt, had beenr burned to. the, ground," together with ' the surrounding forts.
\u0084 The, place , was represented aa, being ,in , the hands of 8000 sailors. , who had
murdered, their^oflicers.r seized! the arsenal and bombarded the imperial palace
â¢.^at â¢ Poterhof,; across^ the . bay.; ; Butchery :j: j was;, said Â«to . have prevailed in the
-streets, all .'during the v day.\and the' riiinors i even. >trent u to the- -extent^ of^saytaft
- that^Father"" John of Kronstadt^had- left the bed on which he was supposed "to
bo dying to lead the mutineers. . ',~..3&SBÂ£liS&l f
Many Â«of. these -sensational, reports were, of course,: entirely false, but suffi
cient (le tails ; have been received .to prove that about 3000 sailors and a battalion
of Â« artillery" from one. of, the. forts, indulged In'a mutiny which was put down
by about 7000 Cossacks and troops of the Imperial Guard, hastily dispatched
from St. Petersburg' and from the garrisons near Peterhof, and that machine
guns had to ; be employed. \ -
Drunken Tars Make Use of the Torch.
Before the arrival of the . troops the sailors, many of whom were drank on
liquor 'plundered. 'from the spirit shops, had set fire to the market and to .several
groups of houses. \u25a0-\u25a0 â¢
.About 200' sailors were' still holding out at midnight, and although these are ex
pected to surrender to-day, the authorities became so alarmed that ; the "" Paul
regiment of the guard was dispatched to Krondstadt at 1 o'clock this morning.
The correspondent of the Associated Press at Kronstadt says that the officers
estimate the. casualties at 200, which is certainly very conservative, in view of
the reports brought by refugees who fled. the town to the mainland.
* At' this critical juncture there is no attempt made in Government circles to
minimize the seriousness of the mutiny, and it Is admitted that if a battalion. of
artillery Joined the sailors in open revolt the mutinous spirit must have been
.contagious. It is admitted that while the Cossacks and guards stood the se
, vere test of shooting upon their fellows in another branch of the service, there
is fear that the mutiny will have a badeffect on the morale of the troops, which
' already, has been badly shaken t>y the revolutionary, propaganda.
As soon as the news of the mutiny, was received here the Seventeenth and
Eighteenth Equipages of Sailors of the Guard were locked in their barracks and
the, barracks surrounded by Cossacks. The sailors were furious with rage and
â¢shouted from the windows that thty were ready to join their mutinous comrades.
Sailors Murder Some of Their Officers.
KRONSTADT, Nov. 9.â The heavens reflected the glare of smoldering fires as
the Associated Press correspondent approached Kronstadt at S o'clock this even
ing. Upon landing, however, hurried inquiries revealed the fact that the troops
and , the loyal : sailors apparently had the upper hand. Fighting had ceased in the
streets/ and the town was quiet, but fears are expressed that there might be fur
ther trouble later. To-night patrols are engaged in hunting dawn and capturing
the mutineers.
The outbreak started yesterday afternoon, when the sailors of the ' Seventh
fort equipage revolted and, it is rumored, killed some of their' officers. They
marched 'out of the barracks and immediately plundered four spirit shops.
Crazed with liquor, they returned and seized their arms and then went on a
rampage.- firing promiscuously upon the troops and the loyal sailors. Later they
were Joined by many of their comrades and fighting continued from midnight
until this morning, when the, terror-stricken inhabitants , began to flee. The
lowest 'estimates place the number of dead at fifty.
Several regiments with eight machine guns from St. Petersburg and Oranien
baum .were landed ( to-day.
Machine Guns Turned Upon' Mutineers.
During the rioting to-day machine guns - were employed against the mutin
ous sailors,; who. had been Joined by a battalion'of artillerymen from ,the for
tress, and which raised the total numberof mutineers to 3000. "The sailors say
their.; chief Â» grievances . are * poor food and clothing aid an insufficient amount
of liberty from barracks. 'â¢'.>?-.'.
Roughs joined in the pillage, but the workmen did not participate In it.
Many of. the" workmen" and the civilian f population have already fled or arÂ«
trying;to flee the city, and docks are piled high with baggage and household
effects. â¢ . BEflB
, -â¢â¢At; midnight the fires are still glowing in the market and another group of
buildings. The stores and houses are boarded up and troops are patrolling the
streets. - <
Searchlights from warships and, torpedo-boats In the harbor are flashing
across the ' waters in - order to aid launches in : their search for individual muti
neers who are trying, to escape to the mainland by boat.
\u25a0 - Though ;a ; majority of the mutineers have surrendered, several hundred are
still l holding out I in\ the -eastern section of the town. ' They have thrown up
barricades,-, butare surrounded, and. Maxim guns are posted-at all the streets
leading; to their strongholds. --..1t Is expected that the remainder of the mutineers
will submit to-morrow. JMBRflfflMnTflMTlff

received licr<? from various points In
Bessarabia show that the anti-Jewish
outbreaks there followed the same lines
as at OJessa. varying only in the num

In Kishenev the disturbances were
preceded by Inflammatory Speeches,
Erendarnies and city omcials ( asserting
that the Jews' had attempted to talce
the life of the local Bishop and intend
ed to loot the treasury. The mob,
thus incited, began the bloody Work.
Carrying ikons and portraits of the
Kmpcror, the mob proceeded to Alex
anilrov, Ji.ishkuns and Gostin streets,
devastating a.r.o pillaging unhindered.
Attempts at self-defense were quelled
by the troop?. Ninety per cent of the
kill fÂ«.l and wounded were victims" of
\u25a0bayonets and rifle bullets. The mas
sacre was luyomp&aied by atrociUes
similar to those M'itnessed in Odessa,
and continued two days.
. Seventy Jews were killed and 120
were woundel. Order is now restored.
A mob at IsmaÂ£ Bessarabia, burned

Trepoff has been removed from the
position of power which he ,occu
pied, that of Governor General of St.
Petersburg and Assistant Minister of
the Interior, and Russia's "Premier has

. Count de Witte has been .fully aware
of the intense hatred General Trepoff's
retention In office was causing; but 'he
never questioned the sincerity, of the
Governor General's co-operation in. the,
introduction of the new regime. Never-,
theless, he recognized the. necessity of ;
Trepoff's removal and the Governor"
General himself agreed that only- Ills
retirement would appease the popular
wrath. The final obstacle was the Em
peror, who had come to believe that
TrepoJC alone was able . to . safeguard .
the life of himself and family," but" his;
Majesty at last yielded on. the. condition
that Trepoff should become" command

STEAD APPEALS FOR CZAR.
SarÂ» Onlj- Nicholas and De Witte Can
Save Russian Nation.
LOND.ON, Nov. 9.â William T. Stead,
\u25a0who arrived In London to-night, said
he wished to supplement the statement
regarding the situation in Russia made
by him In Berlin Tuesday. The whole
drift of his conversation showed how
deeply he was Impressed with the abso
lute necessity of extending the fullest
eupport and sympathy to Emperor
Nicholas, both at home and abroad.
Stead said:
The birth throes of nations are bloody and
the old order will not pass without much suf
feiir.g. I appeal to the American people for
KtKerous sympathy for the Emperor especially
and for Count de Witte and the Russian nation
in this time of peril.
Since General Gordon I have never. met any
one co imbued with absolute religious faith
as the Ernpercr of Russia. Call it fatalism,
mysticism, what you will, it Is the sole secret
of his marvelous composure, which Is the
amazement, envy and inspiration of all per.
fonj admitted to his Intimacy. He is abso
lutely devoid of personal fear, and Is ready
to make acy sacrifice for the welfare of his
people. His only dread Is lest he should mis
interpret the will of God.

FRESXO, Nov. . 9.â Quail on. toast as

San Francisco is nothing | more than
"Billy" owl on toast. So declares Pat
Hughe?, a professional pothunter, who
confesses to having supplied large quan
tities of that burrowing bird to the San
Francisco markets. The revelation came
to-day In the local Justice court, where
Hughes had been hauled by Game War
den E. E. Pedlar for misdemeanor.
Hughes admitted he had " slaughtered
ground owls by the. wholesale, but made
the defense that they were game birds,
he having for two years been in the busi
ness of furnishing them to San Francisco
restaurants, where' they had been served
as quail,. a delicacy highly prized by epi
cures. The defense struck Justice of the
Peace Smith as being well grounded* and
he agreed to. withhold" Judgment in the
case until Game Warden Pedlar may com
municate with State Game Warden Vog
elsang and secure' an expert opinion as to
whether or not the "Billy" owl is game.

PRESIDENT'S
MESSAGE IS
COMPLETED
Tariff and Recipro
city Questions
Ignored.
Other Problems Consid
* ered of Paramount
Importance.
Discussion Over the Dingley
Schedules Would Imperilll
Favored Measures.
Special Dispatch to The CaiL
WASHINGTON, Nov. 9.â ln his annual
message to Congress President Roosevelt
may ignore the tariff and reciprocity
Questions. If he shuts the door in the
face of the troublesome and ever present
applicant for admission to the document,
he will be following a notable precedent
*>et by himself last year. \-S t
There is no secret about the fact that
high tariff advocates of the "touch-not
mine-ancient-landmark" stamp have been
urging the President dally to say nothing
on tiiriff matters, and it is known as cer
tain that friends of reciprocal trade have
been urging him to speak his mind, being
themselves firm in the belief that the
Presidents mind is their/mind.
Silence is considered the price of safety
fcr s;me of the President's measures
tvhkh stand apart from the tariff, and U
he considers their interests paramount he
xnay keep his pen off the subject of Dlng
ley duties, even though the victory over
the inclination to rap the stand-patters
Come after a hard fight with himself. .
The President's message is practically
complete, though this statement ignores
a possible tariff reference. P^rty lea!ders
who are interested especially In legisla
tion which will call for comment or rec
ommendation have been consulted and
the President has ignored neither friend
nor foe of projects which he thinks Con
gress should forward.
There are those who have been in the
chamber of the council who say the
President will not verge on radicalism,
but the prophets do not include railroad
legislation, about which all are at sea
except the President and three members
of the House Committee of Interstate
Commerce.

MRS. HUBBARD SAFELY ENDS
LABRADOR EXPLORATION.
She Reports Success and Will Return by Boat
WOMAN WHO HAS COMPLETED A PERILOUS TRIP INTO THE WILDS OF
LABRADOR TO FINISH THE WORK OF HER HUSBAND AND TO LOCATE
MINE HE DISCOVERED. .
NEW YORK, Nov. 9iâ Mrs. Leonidas
Hubbard Jr., who has been exploring
in Labrador, and for whose safety fears
were entertained, to-day reported her suc
cessful completion of the expedition. The
following telegram, signed by her and
dated yesterday at Chateau Bay. Quebec,
was to-day received by Herbert L.
Brldgeman of Brooklyn: . "Successful.
Will return home by the steamer King
Edward."
When Mrs. Hubbard undertook the
perilous trip into the wilds of Labrador,
it was given out that she desired to com
plete the work begun by. her husband
and left unfinished by his death. How
ever, from trustworthy sources it was
learned that Hubbard had discovered a
gold mine of great richness while explor
ing the country and Mrs. Hubbard had
been made aware of the fact by letter.
This secret had also become the property
of D. Wallace, who was a companion of
Hubbard in his explorations which had
such a trasic ending.
Mrs. Hubbard and Wallace left the
United States for Labrador v.-lthin a few
days of each other In a race for the cov
eted mine. It was a contest without par
allel over a wilderness of tnow with over
whelming difficulties to be surmounted.
It was at the time believed impossi
ble for a woman to cross the country.
Mrs. Hubbard's dispatch is taken to
mean that she has rediscovered the
mine and filed a legal claim. Wallace
has not been heard from in several
months. . .
Leonidas Hubbard went to Labrador
originally on a trip of exploration* for
Outing, the well-known magazine. His
plan was to live upon the game and flsh
of the region, but he starved to death
and his companions barely escaped
with their lives.

SAX DOMINGO. Nov. 9. â The country
is perfectly quiet. The rumors that a

that the cruiser Denver left Guantan

to which place Rear Admiral Bradford
was ordered to send a warship because

also has been advised that Rear Admi
ral Bradford sailed yesterday with his

FEAST OF PEACE
HELD IN LONDON
Premier Balf our and Einbas
sador Eeid Talk of the
End of Wai* at Banquet
iCOEDIAL , EXPRESSIONS
Elaborate Ceremony at the
lnauouratioii of the New
Lord Mayor in Metropolis
LONDON,. Nov. 9.â "A century ago
Pitt, standing where I now stand, proph
esied r war. To-day : I prophesy peace."
\ This was â¢ the text on which ? Premier
Balfour based his speech concerning the
relations "of Great 'Britain with foreign
countries at the Lord Mayor's banquet in
the I Guild hall to-night. -Mr. Balfour and
Whitelaw Reid, the "American Embassa
dor, who replied' to the toast of "Their
Excellencies, the Foreign Ministers,"
proposed. by the Lord Mayor, vied with
each other in. pleasant words for the
credit of their respective "countries as
leaders aniong the advocates of arbitra
tion. The -whole tenor oÂ£ the j speeches
was optimistic. The' Premier's " reference
to Russia was particularly happy. He
said:
Our friends /in Russia are absorbing public
Interest by the great movement they, are mak
ing' ln.the 'direction, as we believe,, 01-self
government. The task ot the Krnperor and his
advisers \u25a0 is 'Indeed not a light onÂ«, . and- those
who for centuries have practiced parliamentary
government know best the difficulties - which
confront them." There is not a citizen in Great
Britain who does not wish them every success,
and 1 express the earnest wish that the move
ment may; not in the future be stained , by the
unnecessary effusion of blocd. We hope that
the movement will bringr, happiness .to count
less millions unsullied by a repetition of the
painful, and horrible ) events which 'make the
initial progress 'so lamentable. ''
The banquet was conducted with all the
quaint- ceremonial peculiar- to the occa
sion. Prior to the banquet the guests were
received -by the Lord Mayor and the
Lady Mayoress .in the great reception
room. of the Guild hall. \u0084 ; -
PREDICTS E.\D OF. WAR.
In proposing : the toast of "The Imperi
al Forces." Sheriff Smallman pleasantly
referred to' the reception in the United
States of the r . British squadron under
command of Prince Louis of Battenberg.
; Balfour devoted a considerable portion
â¢f his speech to the unemployed, express
ing sympathy and his desire to in every
way possible' help' those -who -are' out of '
work and appealing to private purses for
assistance during the -stress.
Passing to: the foreign, policy of the
Government, tho Premier spoke first of
Russia and then said that his Majesty's
Government had done everything possible
for many yearsto ward off thedangers
of war and had done Its , best to 'develop
a scheme of arbitration.
"I am sanguine on' this subject.", said
the speaker." "I thinkin the future we
shall not see war. unless indeed we : c'ari
conceive of a nation or a ruler arising
who will be unable to carry out a-scheme
of national .:t aggrandizement \u25a0: â¢- except
through trampling \ on the rights of, his
neighbors, j; However, I. see! no 'prospect
of such a calamity in Europe.'*
Embassador, Reid, in j opening, referred
to Viscount j Hayashi as the "new Em
bassador," and said he should have 'been
selected to respond to the toast to the rep
resentatives of nations,; because
of Ihis well-known and also be
cause he was | more-capable' of doing jus
tice' to the' subject. â¢' '. ' : 3
AMERICA FOR* PEACE.V .
Referring to the Premier's expressions
concerning the probabilities of peace. Mr.
Reid said- It was the business of diplo
matists to make peace and 'not war, and
for his part" he preferred :tfie court of
arbitration jto N the . arbitrament . of ; the
sword.' The Embassador "said .he would
neither concede nor dispute 7 Mr.' Balfoiir's
claim that Great Britain had taken prece
dence In the matter of arbitration, but he
would say Great Britain and the United
States had set an example and had set
tled some of the most burning. questions
through arbitration, and that to-day the
two countries were more cordial in their
relations, than they had beenat any time
in the. last hundred years. '
"If you hear of the ; possibility of dif
ferences over, fisheries or something else,
do not believe It," said : the Embassador,
"because such a, report will.be the result
of absolute misinformation. -There Is =no
question to-day between" the .United
States and Great Britain that Secretary
Root and Secretary -Lansdowne cannot
speedily settle, and ; while King Edward
and President Roosevelt 8 , retain their
places there is sure to be a continuance of
good : relations." . : \u25a0;
* Mr. -Reid closed Jwith a tribute to the
action, of ' President Roosevelt in bringing
about peace between Russia and Japan,
and ' said that King Edward was known
throughout the United States jas| an ear
nest advocate of /peace.- whose tact .and
moderation had : endeared J him ' to every
citizen of the republic.
The new. â¢ Lord' Mayor went; in state to
day through the city streets;, to; the law
courts, where' he. took ; the: oath; of -office.
The procession, in; which the , various
associations of the city took part, was
Imposing, and the j route was lined by im
mense crowds of people. Among the floats
was .one typifying;; peace, .which was
draped with immense .American flags, a
tribute Ito President Roosevelt's : success

BOOM FOR KING
LOXDON, Nov. 9 % â King Edward cele
brated his; sixty-fourth , birthday to
day at Sandringhani.' * ' Congratulatory
teltarrams poured'; in. from all. parts of
the world. - The usuaKsalutes were flred :
and there" were the customary celebra
tions in Great Britain and the colonies.
NEW YORK, Nov*. 9.â At noon to-day
six British warships in the Hudson
River, in unison with double that'num
ber of .'American .'men-of-war, \u25a0 fired a
salute 'of twentyr-ohe guns in honor of
King Edward,; who; celebrated ; to-day,
his; sixty-fourth birthday. Bedecked
from stem â¢to stern" with gayly flutter
ing flags .of many colors, the column
of ships stretched for four miles up the
Hudson River, . from .Forty-second to
One Hundred and Twenty-fifth street,
by far the largest and most_ formidable
Anglo-American . naval force ever as
sembled in a home or a foreign port.
The weather was perfect. . As ihe last
gun of the salute : thundered forth
across the water came the strains of
"God Save the King" from the flagships
of the respective squadrons, the melody
being taken up by a thousand voices
on shore. . .
The British squadron passed In
through the Narrows at 7:25 a. m., the
flagship Drake at the head of the
column. As the squadron passed Gov
erners. Island the flagship thundered
forth a national salute of twenty-one
guns, which the shore batteries/ an
swered in kind. Without diminishing
speed tho cruisers swung around Into
the Hudson River.' The sight of the
vessels set the whistles of every craft
In the harbor shrieking in welcome.
Despite the early hour, hundreds had
gathered along the shore line and
doffed their hats and waved handker
chiefs In greeting to the visitors.
Throughout, this splendid welcome
Rear" Admiral Prince Louis stood on
the after bridge- of .the Drake, pleased
and impressed. As the squadron came
past; the quarantine station each ship
had lowered her small etorm color and
hoisted, in 'its stead the \u25a0â¢: large ensign,
which dipped again : and again .In an
swer to the salutes of -passing craft.
Stretching down the Hudson, await
ing the coming of the British squadron,
in full dr^ss were "the twelve men-of
war of Rear Admiral fleet.
Steaming to within 400 yards of the
flagship Maine, the , flagship Drake
dropped anchor shortly before 9 o'clock.
Although the official salutes between
the r= squadrons first: occurred off Ann
apolis, ias a special mark of courtesy-
Admiral Evans' .flagship greeted the
royal ~ standard wltli a" national salute
of twenty-one guns. This keenly, de
lighted Prince Louis.-who later thanked
Admiral Evans " when the latter, ac
companied by Rear/Admirals Davis and
Brownson,' repaired aboard 4 the Drake
at 9:30 o'clock to felicitates the Ad
miral-Prince, on the birthday of his
sovereign.
; Thirteen guns hailed' Rear Admiral
Evans as he went over 1 the side vi the
Drake. Before the smoke of the salutes
had cleared away the President's yacht,
the Mayflower; in command of Captain
Winslow, steamed past . and anchored
near the Kentucky, off . the Jersey
shore. '
Ever .since j his i squadron > anchored
Prince Louis has y been; kept busy re
ceiving and returning official calls. HÂ«
found time, however, to receive thiÂ»
morning a delegation of New York re
por terÃ, who i were, received ; aboard his
flagship and to whom he ; talked auita

ST. LOUIS. Nov. 9.â The New York Life
Insurance Company, through its attor
neys. F. N. Judson and Former Attorney
General Crowe, late this afternoon applied
to United States Circuit Judge Adams for
an injunction to restrain State Insurance
Superintendent Vandiver from enforcing
his order prohibiting the company from
carrying on further business in Missouri.
The application was favorably passed
Ujv.n by Judge Adams. 'who issued a re
straining order directing Superintendent
of Insurance Vandiver to appear before
the Fed. ral Court at Jefferson City on
November 20 to show cause why he should
rot bo prevented from enforcing his order
excluding: th* New York Life Insurance
Company from doing further business in
Missouri, and ordering: that, pending the
hearing; the superintendent's ortier be not
enforced.

day that Judge Adams of the United

Â»Â«upJ a temporary injunction restraining
him from enforcing his order suspending
the license of the New York Life Insur
ance Company to do business in this
State, made the following statement:
I do not carp to express an opinioin at this
HÂ»jÂ» ft the !<r<-ve*p<s!ngs. The question is now

Vandiver earlier to-day gave out the fol
lowing interpretation of his order concern-
Ing the New York Life Insurance Com
pany:
I have repr-atedly stated that it has no effect
\u25a0whatever, except on the -wrritinÃ of new poll
cie*. Thf- company has never been compelled
to keep an office in Missouri for the transac
tion of ltf business with Missouri policy hold
ers, but f'ap'iione so as a matter of convenience
and tlits-e is nothing in this order of suspen
sion to keep them from doing so. A careful
reading of my order and of the statute shows
that it refers to writing of life insurance and
not to collection of renewal premiums or any
other kind of Â»>u*lneFs. It refers to the writ
ing of new business, simply this and nothing
more. It may be added also. that as the order
is for the suspension anj not absolute revoca
tion, the company may yet comply with the
requirements at any time it chooses to do so.
and. of course. In that event the order would
be vacated.

testimony before the insurance investi
gating committee, was for a number of
years maintained by funds of the Mutual
Life Insurance Company, . was again
given sole attention by Charles E. Hughes,
counsel for the committee, when Michael
P. Mullaney, the caretaker of the house,
was called to-day as a \u25a0witness.
Mullaney's testimony was in great part
a corroboration of previous testimony
that A. C. Fields, while employed as sta
tionery agent of the Mutual, also looked
after legislative matters and paid â¢ the
rent for the Albany bouse.
To-day a number of vouchers signed by
Mullaney were identified by the witness,
who acknowledged receiving the money
for them. Some purported to be for legal
services, some for sundries and some for
traveling expenses. Witness said he was
not a lawyer and could not explain why
vouchers were made out. J. M. Beck,
counsel for the Mutual, however, took oc
casion to remind the counsel that all
vouchers for the maintenance of this'
house, it had been testified, were charged
to legal expenses. Hughes said that did

Facfa About the American Indian's
Healthy Hair.'
,The American Indian, accustomed
from time immemorial to gro barehead-
ed In al kinds of weather, Is never
troubled with falling hair or baldness.
The close atmosphere caused by our
"civilized" head-gear is conducive to
the breeding: of infinitesimal germs
which dig into the scalp and' thrive on
the sap of the hair-root.
This true cause of baldness is of re-
tent discovery and explains the, non-
success of all hair-vigors which treated
baldness as a functional disorder.
Newbro*s Herpicide isa direct exter-
minator of the gflrm.. It destroys the
cuuse and permits the hair to grow as
natur*; intended.

Mullaney could hot tell what' the sun
dries were unless they were supplies. He
had taken trips to New York to see Fields
at the latter's* suggestion. He did- not
know how many times he^had been to

for Fields. Nineteen vouchers were iden
tified ;by i Mullaney, for all of which he
admitted* he; received, the money, which
aggregated $3739. These were paid be
tween March 7. 1900, and" July 12, 1905.

to Albany from New York for Fields and
had never paid out any. money for Fields.
The greater part of the day . William
Barnes Sr., formerly of Albany, but now
living ' at Nantucket, Mass., sat ' in the
committee room waiting to be called, but
late in the afternoon he was excused for
the day. Barnes figured in this investiga
tion several weeks ago when vouchers
for legal services, bearing his signature,
were produced, together with a . . letter
signed by William ' Barnes Jr. of Albany,
reminding the Mutual Life that his fath
er's "honorarium" had not been received,

LARGE PAY FOR OFFICIALS.
The Metropolitan Life Insurance Com
pany figured in the greater 'i part of the
day's proceedlnge. JohniÃr Hegeman,
president of the company, who was on
the stand when adjournment was taken
yesterday, was the first witness to-day,
and the expenses of the company were
further gone Into. It was brought out
that Hegeman's salary is the same as
that of John A. McCall, president of the
New York Life, >â,000. Previous to 1903,
however. Hegeman 'received $90,000. The
talary of Vice President haley Fiske is
$75 000 George H. Gaston, second vice
president, receives $37,500, and Frank O.
Ayres, third vice president, receives
$16,250.
The work of agents in the field and
their compensation was taken up with
Hegeman, and later James McCraigh, the
actuary, was called to supply details as
to figures with which Hegeman was not
familiar.
Later In the day when McCraigh had
been excused, Hegeman was again called
and the subject of the company's securi
ties was taken up, but the interrogation
had hardly begun when adjournment for
the day was ordered.
Hegeman said that, when' the .finance
committee consulted him about increas
ing salaries in 1904, be replied:
I said that I had received $90,000 for . two
ye arÂ» and was Â«atlsfled and \u25a0 gratified and did
not dh4 any Increase.- They agreed, how
ever In consideration of my thtrty-flve years'
service to Increase It to $100,000. I have . not
drawn it. however, and don't Intend, to do so."
Of all tie words that I abhor, the perpendicular
pronoun- has the* primacy, but I would like* to
say that -I have., averaged a salary of $50,000
only and have- continued with the company to
my- pecuniary disadvantage. -Fifteen years ago
I was guaranteed $ 1 00. Of oto go elsewhere.-

a Coroner's Jury here yesterday, 2000 kegs
of. powder," representing a .value of about
$10,000, were exploded by ; a powder -. com
pany. The shock of the explosion was
felt in severai'surrounding townships and
there was /great," excitement throughout
this end of the county. > '. ".
The Coroner's jury, which has been
sitting on the cases of eighteen persons
killed in the explosion at Falrchance on
September 9, had expressed a desire for
information as to' the direction in which
the exploding powaer 'exerted Its greatest
force. The powder people have taken the
stand that the big magazines,. which went
off on September 9, had been exploded by
some agency outside â¢ the magazines.
They claimed that some one having^ a
spite against the concern had placed and
exploded under; the magazines containing
10,000 kegs, of powder some other ', explo
sive,' either fulminate of mercury or nitro
glycerine. In defense of Â» this It was
claimed; that powder, . in exploding, does
not tear holes " In the ground, and' the
company offered jto prove | this by practi-.
cal demonstration ; to i the , Coroner's Jury.
The Coroner's' Jury retired .to; a great

TEXAN FIGHTS
FOR HIS CHILD
2ich Eancher AslvS Coiu-t to
Restore Daughter Who, He
Says, Was Illegally Adopted
LAW POINTS INVOLVED
flSvo Judges Sit on Case to
Decide Whether the Father
Shall Have His Offspring
OAKLAND. Nov. â¢.â The efforts of
Stephen Jennings to secure thÂ» custody
of his little daughter, Lillian, were con
sidered In court to-day, and -because of
the many legal problems to be solved,
Judges Melvin and Harris sat In bank
on the case. It is an Intricate problem
that they must solve, and involves the
law of adoption in this State.
Several years ago. It is alleged, Mrs.
Jennlngi ran away from, her hojne in
Texas, taking her little daughter with
her. According to the complaint, she
lived bere with John Hardin, a contrac
tor, and when Hardin died she agreed
that M. M. Knight and his wife, who live
at 833 Thirty-sixth street, should adopt
the child, who was thereafter known as
leura Blanche KniÃht. or Hardin. It
is the contention of Jennings that the
child was never legally adopted and his
attorneys. A- I* Frick, Everett Brown
and "W. H. I* Hlnes, decided to bring
habeas corpus proceedings in order to re
cover the little one.
"Whether the matter Is onÂ© of collateral
or direct attack against those holding" the
child Is \u25a0what the two Judges must decide,
but the attorneys for the petitioners say
that it Is a direct attack and that they
propose to show that khÂ© child was never
legally adopted. In that eha was adopted
tinder a name not her own. The habeas
corpus petition was read In court this
eiternoon and the hearing of arguments
was continued until to-morrow evening,
owing to the crowded condition of the
court calendars. The girl's mother is
dead. Jennings Is a wealthy Texan
rancher.
BOY BITES TONGUE;
MAY LOSE SPEECH
Young: Walter Forrest Meets
With Peculiar Accident
in Oakland.
OAKLAND, Nov. 9.â Walter Forrest, a
14-year-old boy, met with an accident this
morning that may deprive him of the
power of speech. He is employed at
Btandeford's candy factory, and this
morning he was operating the elevator,
when the elevator crank became loose
and struck him on the jaw, driving his
teeth almost through his tongue. The
end of his tongue, almost severed from
that member, was treated at the Receiv
ing Hospital, and the boy was taken to
his home at 851 Thirty-seventh street,
where, it is expected, he will be confined
for several weeks. Physicians fear that
Jt may be necessary to amputate the
tongue to prevent blood poisoning.

BIC YCLING MINISTER
VIOLATES THE LAW
Bluecoat Gathers In : Rev.H.B.Mo\^
bray for Running Without Lamp. ;
automob!lists are in; court
OAKLAND, Nov. 9.â The Rev. H. B.
Mowbray, assistant pastor of the First
Congregational Church, of which the Rev.
Charles R. Brown is pastor, fell into the
clutches of Patrolman McCready to-night.
McCready is the relentless detective who
has been making Oakland a place of ter
ror for bicyclists. Mr. Mowbray, think
ing he could reach home . without being
molested, was riding down Telegraph
avenue, when at the corner of Seven
teenth street he ran into the arms of
Officer McCready, and as a result he was"
forced to put up $2 for his freedom.
Evidently every one "looks alike to Mc-
Cready when he is after bicycle riders,
and neither relationship to the Chief of
Police nor the ministerial cloth serve to
soften hU heart.
Don C. McCord' and R. J. Chapman,
two of the automobilists for whom war
rants were issued yesterday on charges
of violation of the ordinance regulating
the speed of automobiles within the lim
its of Oakland, to-day walked into the
police station, having heard that war
rants had been issued for their arrest,
and gave themselves into custody. Me-
Cord arrived before court had opened
this morning', and he was released on his
own recognizance, and a few minutes
later his case was called in the Police
Court, when judgment was suspended.
Later Chapman save himself up, and
was placed under arrest by Jailer Tim
Flynn. He was released on $20 bail, and
his case will be disposed of to-morrow
morning.

Alleged Visit; to That City
OAKLAND, Nov. 9.â Captain . of Police
.Walter J. Petersen," who was charged by
three- members of the Ban Francisco Po
lice Department with, having been intoxl-.
cated in the ferry depot at San. Francisco;
and with; having flourished a^plstol and
acted : in a disorderly ; manner, clearly
proved : his ' innocence.' of \u25a0 the " pffenses
charged against him,: at an . investigation
held- by the ;Board of Polices and- Fire
Commissioners this â¢ morning. The three
accusing. San Francisco officers testified
that Captain Petersen was the man who
had approached them in the ferry depot,
and had acted In, a boisterous and disor
derly manner, and had exhib.ted his pis-,
tol, but when asked to place the date, of
Iho alleged occucrence, none of the three
was able to : .do more, than say the inci
derft happened either in the latter part
of /February or, the early part of .March
of this ?jear. . ;. . .
Only one of his accusers, Officer Frank
de Grancourt.vwas even able to positively
identify .Captain, Petersen ,as ,the nian
whom he had seen on tne night in ques
tion, and much of the .value of his testi
mony was .lost when he j stated .flatly In
answer to a question ', by Judge:. A. L.
Frlck, representing Captain Petersen, that
he had made the matter public' through
motives of revenge. In his' cross-exami
nation of De ; Clrancourt, Frlck asked if
he had not been. lnduced to i report the
alleged actions of Captain . Petersen to
Chief of Police. Dlnan of , San Francisco
because Captain ; Petersenj in an address
before .the. .Young. Men's Christian Asso
ciation of. San . Francisco,: had criticized
.the methods, of .the San .Francisco". Police
\u25a0Department. T.Thp witness" answered, that
this had" beeri'his reason for/ making his
report and ; that he was glad that It had
been. piibilshed. - . ".'. : .. '. . .. /.-". \u25a0','>'./."

James F. Welsh, another of .Captain

port by .the same cause." Officer M.. Mor
ris, the third of the trio of accusers, who
did not file a report of the alleged.occur
rence with the San Francisco Chief of
Police/testified that he had seen Captain
Petersen on the occasion mentioned in
the reports, of his .brother : officers, and
that he had been under, the influence of
liquor at . the' ,tlme, -but when asked' to
Identify Captain Peiersen. this morning,
he refused to say positively that the' Ca
ptain was the same man he had* seen. ln"
San Francisco. Officer Welsh also j said
that he would not care vo - swear;''that
Captain Petersen was the right man.
: One of the strongestVfacts brought' out
in favor-, of the accused!"offlcer was "the
declaration of !alt;tKree\'of the San Fran-Â»
cisco policemenr.that he, had worn a mus
tache on â¢ the occasion ... hi question; - All
were positive on this point; while the fact
Is, that Captain Petersen r has? been clean
shaven for the last { two /years, Welsh,
,who is the .authorlty,:for^the: statement
that Petersen-, had flourlshe&his pistol in
.the ferry depot,, said that (he ?had exhib
ited a nicKel-plated, or, at. leasf,'*a silver
colored weapon, while } Captain 1 Petersen
.was ab.e to prove conclusively that since
the month of July, 1904. he has carried no
pistol except a black Colt's revolver. 4

. Captain Petersen was able to prove con
clusively by the testimony of the officers
who had been on duty at the Oakland
Police Office during- the nights of the
months of February and March of this
year ' that â¢on no, occasion" during those
months was he absent from the office for

"CO-EDS" CHEAT

Professor Torrey's Announce
ment^of Facts to His Class
Creates a Mild Sensation
GIRL STUDENTS DROPPED
Offending Maidens Will' Be
Required to Absent Them
selves From Zoology Talk
BERKELEY, Nov. 9.â Two University
"co-eds," alleged to be guilty of cheat
ing _at examinations, have been dropped
by. Professor Harry B. Torrey from his
class, announcement to this effect having
been made by Professor Torrey to-day.
The circumstance was made the occasion
of a startling sermon by the instructor up
on the low grade of . honor apparently pre
vailing m among certain sections of the
Btudent body. For thirty minutes Pro
fessor Torrey held the attention 1 of his
class, while he described \u25a0 the manner in
which the guilt -of the two offending
"co-eds" had been determined, and the
consequences of such actions both in and
out of s the university Â»
Professor Torrey did not give the names
of the girl students who have been di
rected to /'absent | themselves from his
class.. There are only about six "co-ed"
members of the-class, however, and it is
supposed that -by the process of elimina
tion the-" identity 'of the girls who 1 have
been dismissed will'be' determined dur
ing: the next few; days. \u25a0:
Professor' Torrey is regarded as one of
the most popular and -able members of the
faculty.. His class in zoology. Is ' well
attended, mostly by seniors. Recently he
conducted an examination. In which all
members of the class took part. When
the papers of two of the girl students
came In they were found to be wrong in
essential-points, and Identical through
out. ""One gjrl had copied, another girl's
report, apparently," and-" In the eyes of
the instructor both were guilty of dis
honorable, action. *^.'M 1 â¢\u25a0:\u25a0\u25a0* :P.

S access of Union Forces in
San Francisco Makes
Them Hopeful.
LOS ANGELES.- Nov. 9.â The victory of
the Sohmltz-Ruef ticket at the recent
election in San Francisco has given to
the movement to unionize Los 'Angeles
a stimulus such as it never before re
ceived. Plans are "being made for a cam
paign which will, if successful, make the
labor unions here as powerful and con
trolled in much the, same manner as they
are in San Francisco. Los Angeles has
never been a union city; in fact, the
Union Labor _ticket when placed before
the people has received scant support. But
with the expected assistance of some of
the San Francisco labor leaders, the union
leaders here hope to bring about a changa
which will give them a power In the po
litical affairs of this community and
county. .
An attempt will be made to unionize
the street railway employes. This has
been attempted before, but without suc
cess.
It is said that the labor leaders will
ally themselves with the Municipal
League people. and with others who have
pet isms which they desire to see incor
porated In the city charter.* but the one
object sought to be attained is that ot
making organized labor a power capable
of dictating and of enforcing Its de
mands.

DISTURBS BETROTHAL PARTY
AND IS RUDELY EJECTED.
Bridearoom^-to-Be Acts tlie Boor
Turns Up His Nose at Feast Given by Fiancee
JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
With an adherence to simplicity that
was characteristic of her life, Miss Ruth
St. Clair provided cracked crabs, crack-,
ers and beer for the refreshment of the
folk Invited to her betrothal party, and
her fiance, William Midklff, painter, re
siding at 651 Broadway, was the only
person present- who failed to ap
prove the fare. The other guests were
two ladies and a mariner (names not dis
closed), and they unanimously assured
the hostess that if she had been a pro
fessional mind-reader she could not have
more accurately divined their individual
hope as to the composition of the menu,
which served to make the undisguised
dissatisfaction of Mr. Midkiff all the more
galling to her, because it was his palate
exclusively that she bad aimed -to tickle.
Consequently the opening of the feastâ
which, by the by, was spread In Miss
St. Clalr*s modest home at 45 Stockton
streetâ was not so barren of unpleasant
ness as had been anticipated.
Mr. Mldkiff, his table companions al
lege, was a veritable ghost at the ban
quet, absolutely ignoring the crab and
crackers and Imbibing more of the beer
than was his fair share, although the
quantity seemed to be unstinted. His
surliness and other breaches of etiquette
were either willfully allowed to pass un
observed or good-naturedly laughed at
until he, without asking permission or
tendering explanation, abruptly aban
doned the group, cast himself full length
upon a lounge, closed his eyes and im
mediately began to make the L chamber â¢
vocal with raucous breathings. Then one
of the lady guests said to the hostess:
"I ain't a bit superstitious, Ruth, but
you know every one says that when a
person falls asleep and snores in presence
of company it means bad luck for all?
present, so I hope you'll excuse me if I
leave before the hoodoo gets fairly down
to work."
The fair speaker rose as if to leave the
table, but the mariner restrained her and
declared that he for one would not per
mit* the evening's pleasure to be spoiled,
before It had commenced, and If Miss St.
Clair so commanded, he would promptly
eject her ill-mannered husband-to-be. '.'lt
would be nothing less than a crime," the
mariner argued, "to let this party be
broken up while the beer has hardly been
touched by any of us three."
This sentiment was applauded by the
two lady guests, x and finally Miss St.
Clair told the mariner to do as he pleased.
"And right here and now," she added, "I
give it out that it's all off between that
thing to the prostrate Mr. Mid
kiff) and me."
Mr. Midkiff was being forced through
the door, by whom he knew not, when
an empty beer bottle. In whose hand he
could not tell, crashed against the back
of his head, but when he returned to the
apartment with a policeman, Miss St.
A Boon
to the Bilious
Are you compelled to deny your-
self diany wholesome foods because
you think they make you bilious?
Do you know that your condition
is more to blame than the foods?
Your liver and stomach need at-
tention more than the diet. When
you find yourself suffering, with a
bilious attack, take
/ \u25a0._ - t \u25a0
and all annoying symptoms will
soon disappear. They settle the v
stomach, regulate the liver and ex-
ercise the bowels. Their good ef-
fects arc felt immediately.
Beccham's Pills mingle with the
contents of the stomach and make
easy work of digestion. The nour-
ishing properties of the ; food are
then readily v assimilated and" the
residue carried off without irrita-
ting the intestines or clogging the
bowels.
Bcecham's Pills should be taken
\u25a0 whenever there is sick headache,
furred tongue, constipation, sallow
skin or any symptoms that indi-
cate an inactive liver.

Clair defiantly confessed that she , it was
who administered the blow. That waa
why 'ho gave her Into 'custody j and al
lowed the other ladies and the " mariner
to depart unaccused by him.' â¢
"After telling me that she did It,'! said
the policeman to Judge Mogan, "she asked
me what was it to me and wnat was I
going: to do about it." -â¢\u25a0.\u25a0' . .
"Well,", put in Hiss St. Clair, who evi
dently had received legal advice after
her arrest, "I say now that I didn't- do

"If you can curb your Impatience until
to-morrow," quoth, the Judge, "I'll .then

When he was arrested for. drunkenness
Timothy Sullivan declared , that he waa
determined to indulge " in a week of
inebriety, and if 'he were not permitted
to pursue such Indulgence uninterrupt
edly he would manage to get it in sec
tions. That declaration; he repeated to
Judge Cabanlss, who asked for enlighten
ment as to the cause of Mr. Sullivan's
desire to tipple continuously throughout
a seven days' period." : .
"Before election," was the answer, "I
promised myself a week's drunk if my
ticket won, and it did win. I'm sober
now, but as soon as I. get out I'll go to
the booze again." - - .
"You seem to be a man of your word,"
the court. remarked.
"That's what I am. I'm slow to make
promises, but If I do make one, to myself
or anybody else, I never. break it. "
"All right." said his Honor. â¢'Forty
eight hours hence you will be at liberty
to launch the second installment of your
spree, and within" less than fifty hours
hence you are likely to be again in Jail"
"Can't help that," said Mr. Sullivan.
"I'm bound to have a week's drunk, If it
takes me a month to do it."
When the grocer at Twelfth and
Howard streets . saw the man pick up
the can of milk from the grocery door
and dash away with it he immediately
shrilled an alarm on his whistle, and
when \Patrolman Firman almost in
stantly responded in person tho man
with the can had bolted around an ad
jacent corner and was invisible. But
the grocer told his tale so rapidly and
withal so intelligibly that the officer
was in complete possession of the facts
and in pursuit of the thief ere the lat
ter had fairly disappeared.
"When the policeman scurried around
the corner he saw a' milk can rolling
on the street and a man standing upon
the sidewalk and apparently consulting
the heavens. Witho.ut hesitancy the
sleuth collared the man and accused
him of having stolen the can, a por
tion of the' late contents of which was
then dribbling from his mouth corners
and dripping upon his tattered coat.
But the man stoutly affirmed that he
had never touched the can in question
and laughed scornfully when the grocer
Identified him as the pilferer.
"You say he was 'drooling' milk?"
Judge Conlan asked the policeman.
"Two streams of it were running
down his Jaws,' was the reply.
"Wat d'ye think I'd .want t' drink
milk f'r?" Inquired the defendant,
booked as James Kelly. "I ain't no kid,
am I?" -i'W&^js \u0084 \u25a0 \u25a0-. '- ,
"The court does not suspect for a mo

said the Judge; "but Hhere ; is no get

had been drinking milk when this of

CRASS VALLEY
MINES CLOSED
Lack of Water Temporarily
'Throws Hundreds of Men
Out of Steady Employment
SITUATION IS CRITICAL
Season Is Driest in Fifty
Years and the Reservoirs
1 Are All About . Drained
GRASS VALLEY, Nov. 9.â Hundreds of
miners -in this city and district were
thrown out of employment' this; morning
when all the big mines were forced to re
duce their working forces ; owing to a
water famine. The shut-down had been
Impending for weeks, as the South Yuba
Water Company's big , reservoir in . the
high Sierras has been gradually drained
in the absence of rains. Its supply finally
became so low that this morning its rep
resentative, after a conference with the
leading mining, superintendents here, is
sued an- order allowing the mines ofily
enough water to run the mills about half
time. Some of the mills have closed en
tirely and It is said if conditions do not
improve every mine in this district will
be | forced to stop within a week. The
situation Is very graye 1 as a thousand men
are employed in the mines here. This
city . is also running short . of water ' and
every drop is being 'husbanded. The sea
son is the driest in fifty years. The mines
in Nevada City district closed some 'days
ago, throwing several hundred". men out
of work. Cattle men are also feeling the
drought, as the dry feed Is all' gone and
no grass is in sight.- They will _be \u25a0\u25a0 forced
to ship in hay from Nevada or the Sacra
mento valley at fancy prices, i*
WATER BECOMING SCARCE. j
Placer County Fecln the Effect* of Con
. tlnnance of Dry Weather.
AUBURN. Nov. 9. â Water is becom
ing very scarce here. The railroad
company has been pumping in many
places for a. month. There is very lit
tle .flow In the South Yuba ditch, and
the company annojunces that it can only
furnish water _ fpr domestic and flrc
purposes. No water is . bahiK sold to
the; mines or for irrigation purposes.
All the i.ower plants of tne California
Electric Company are shut down and the
electric light plants in Sacramento and
in this vicinity are bein.? operated by
steam power ,in Sacramento. A con

HOME-MADE STOMACH
PUMP PROVES SUCCESS
Pieces of Pork Attached to
Strings and Swallowed
Save Two Lives.
Special Dispatch. to The Call.
FREELAND, Pa., Nov. 9.â A home
made stomach pump, invented on the spur
of the moment by J. W. Graaf of Wap
wallopen, saved the lives of. Ira Boyd and
his wife. Mrs. Boyd served what she be
lieved to be mushrooms for supper,- but
after the family. retired the husband and
wife became violently Â»111. Theiv had
eaten toadstools by mistake. ;
Graaf, who was camping in the 'vicinity,
was summoned to the rescue and tried
emetics without effect. At last he con
ceived the idea of a new type of stom
ach Dump. He procured two fat pieces
of. pork. "Attaching strings to them he
made each patient, swallow a piece. Then
he pulled them out by the strings.
The result was .marvelous, as the pa
tients vomited copiously. Dr. Santee of
Wapwallopen. who arrived on the scene
later, found them unconscious. He ap
plied restoratives and^ the Boyds were
revived. The doctor said Graaf's heroic
treatment alone saved their lives.
The Way to Believe In Advertising.
The average merchantâ not the big
and dominatnig one, but the average
oneâ knows more about the kind of a
location he should have, the kind of a
building^ the sort of fixtures, the grades
and kinds of goods, the kind of -clerks,
the sort of delivery system, and credit
system, the secrets of when and where
and how to buy and the knack of really
producing bargain offerings than he
known about' the, art of real and ef
fective Ntnre-ml vert lnliijjt. â . .
He devotes two hours of his time to
day to closing a' deal for "wrapping pa
per â another hour to teaching boys or
girls how to wrap up packages â an
other hotlr~to. an inspection of newly
arrived goodsâ takes a look at the ac
countsâallows subordinates to take up
his time with such weighty questions
as that of where to have the, delivery
horses shodâ i-and finds himself \u25a0â¢'too
busy" to prepare a really forceful, hu
man-interest store-advertisement.
; .-,Of course, "the average, merchant" is
not intentionally crippling store
he \u25a0 simply allows a ' multitude of small
things to shut out the importance of
the really vital, thing â the store-pub
licity. He "believes in advertising," but
he does not see its rational part in the
management of his store. He does not
"believe"; in it as he believes in attrac
tive show-windows. -He does not be
lieve in it as he believes In polite clerks',
in honest values, in fuel for the heating
plant, in secure locks on his store
doors.-. ;-â¢; ->:\u25a0 .'..'\u25a0:''\u25a0'': : \u25a0 -:\u25a0--. ; ;

THE POLITICAL MIXUP.
THE year's elections are over and present a kaleidoscopic ap
pearance. Chicago, overwhelmingly . Democratic at the city
election last spring, turns about face and goes , overwhelmingly
Republican. Ohio, giving a record Republican majority last year,
turns completely, and gives one of the largest Democratic majorities
in her history." Mr. Pattison, the Governor-elect, is an interesting
character. He is the president of the largest and most successful
life insurance company west of New York, is a radical prohibitionist
and a churchman. In'these days of acute and justifiable suspicion of
the great life insurance companies, he must have extraordinary qual
ities to command popular confidence. It was a new departure for
the Ohio Democracy to go to an insurance company and the water
wagon for a candidate and leader, but the novelty won.'
Governor Pattison carries a Democratic Legislature into power
with him. This will not affect either of the Republican Senators
from that State. Mr: Foraker's term does not expire until 1909 and
Mr. Dick's until 1911. One cause of the reversal seems to have
been a revolt in the Republican party against bosses. This is shown
by the Democratic r^ijority given in Hamilton County, where Boss
Cox has ruled for many years, and is not believed to have been very
scrupulous about his methods.
In Pennsylvania the same cause produced the same result. The
upheaval in Philadelphia under the leadership' of Mayor Weaver
carried the State with it, and the Republican party went down under
the assault. A great contributing cause was the fall of the national
bank in Pittsburg. with the tragedy of its cashier's suicide, and the
revelation of credits extended to politicians for speculative purposes.
These revelations got very close to Senator Penrose, and sufficed
to add what weight was necessary to the disclosures in Philadelphia
to reverse the State.
In Maryland Senator Gorman seems to be completely unhorsed.
His amendment to the State constitution to disfranchise the negroes
is badly beaten and his entire political machine is smashed into bits.
The leadership in this result was taken by Mr. Bonaparte, Secretary
of the Xavv. grand-nephew of the great Napoleon, who seems to
have in him the fighting blood of the Little Corporal, grafted upon
American horse sense.
In New York City, while Tammany elects McClellan Mayor, the
power of that organization is for the time in eclipse. It lost heavily
in the other branches of the city government. There, too, the re
volt against too much bossing was a factor in the fight, while the
revelations of questionable methods in the great insurance compa
nies helped on. Mr. Hearst was supported by thousands as the
representative of anti-Tammany exasperation. The feud will prob
ably lead to another split in the New York Democracy, like that be
tween the ancient Hunkers and Barnburners, and the later schism
between the Short Hairs and Swallow Tails. The election of Mr.
Jerome to continue as District Attorney is gratifying to the whole
country. He was antagonized by Hearst and Tammany, and was
not on the Republican ticket, though the Republican nominee for
that office withdrew to give him the right of way. He ran alone and
independently, and it is a great compliment to his personality that
the people took pains to find his name and stamp it.
Of course, in such a high and mighty time, with a political gale
abroad and the sand and dust flying, Kentucky had to be in it, and
the municipal elections in Louisville and other Kentucky towns
supplied excitement enough to have; satisfied Daniel Boone and
Chucka Jack, as a substitute for Indian fighting. State politics was
not affected and the Legislature will elect Senator Blackburn or a
Democratic successor.
For a significant indication of something permanent in political
conditions, however, we have to come as far west as Utah. In Salt
Lake City the Democratic candidate for Mayor was a Mormon. The
Republican candidate was actively supported by Senator Smoot. The
new American party, organized by ex-United States Senator Kearns,
put a full Gentile ticket in the field on an anti-Mormon platform,
pledged to oppose church influence in politics,' to drive the church
teachings out of the public schools, and to make a stand for the
right of non-Mormons to live in Utah and enjoy the civil liberty
and rights of American citizens.
That ticket won out, and its victory is believed to have wrecked
Senator Smoot politically. He quarreled with his brother apostle,
Penrose, and even the many-wived president of the church had to
interfere to restrain his frenzied politics. Senator Kearns seems to
have read the signs of the times rightly in Utah, and has not waited
long for vengeance upon his former colleague. The American party
proposes to organize for the State fight, and, if it concentrate the
Gentile vote, with the assistance of excommunicated Mormons likt
former Senator Frank Cannon, it will give the church a run for its
money.
It is somewhat difficult out of all this confusion to get a line
on future national issues. If we take indications from New York
City, the Hearst faction will be expected to join socialism to the
National Democracy. But in Ohio the platform on which Governor
Pattison was elected rejected public ownership and other socialistic
features. These things indicate a fierce contest in the Democratic
party over the platform of 1908.
WAGES AND FOOD.
LABOR has a much more serious problem before it than the
raising of wages, namely, the proper adjustment between the
rate of wages and the cost of living. There has been a long,
hard struggle, especially in trie last ten years, by thk workers, to
lift up the scale of wages. They succeeded admirably. To accom
plish this took energy, self-denial, brains, the rare gifts of ability
to combine and co-operate and a world of patience and persistence.
This combination of high qualifications, great 4 as it is, can be called
only a little thing compared to the brains, energy and persistence it
is going to take to secure such an adjustment between wages and
the expense of existence that the workers will really reap an ad
vantage from that rise in wages which they have so laboriously
brought about.
A glance at those stubborn things, statistics, will show that. to
be true. Looking at the figures of wages as isolated from other
tables, the earners seem to have gone forward in strides that might
be measured in feet and yards ; but when we compare with this the
cost of living we find that their progress in ten or fifteen years is
just a crawling up by fractions of an inch. It is not a subject for
despair, though, for even a plodding progress is reason for con
gratulations, and the lalest bulletin of the Bureau of Labor shows
that we do creep slowly toward easier earned and better livings.
The point to "be noted is that the lifting of the prices of labor
is a mere ; detail in social improvement; for, unless other items of, a
comprehensive plan- go hand in hand with bigger wages, the total
effect will be just as the seesaw progress of children on the <two
ends of a plank, who could toil at their game for ten years and never
average higher from the ground than when they began to alternately
rise skyward.
If, when the workers boost the wage scale, the producers come
right along with a boost. of what they have to buy, where are they
as net result? They might just as well have been sitting down
composedly and waiting for the strategy and tactics of the greater
sociologists to get in their work of elevating the whole of humanity
instead of seesawing one class. against another class. For example,
consider this one item: A table shows that wages for 1904, as com
pared with the average for the ten-year period of 1890 to 1899, had
increased, measured by earnings per hour, as high as 17 per cent;
but the wages of one hour would purchase only 417: per .cent
more food. ,\u25a0\u25a0;\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 -
THE -SAN, FRANCISCO JCALU NO\^RERgIQM9OS:
STRANGE MISFORTUNES THAT BEFELL
TH E M AN WHO KICKED A DOG.
WILLIAM EBERTS of Lynchburg, Ohio., will never
kick a dog again.; - â¢ ; *
This is .not entirely. due to the fact that he has
losÂ£ both legs/ which makes .it a â¢ physical impossi
bility for him to kick a dog, but because he ii now convinced
that misfortune and trouble are certain to follow upon
the trail of the man who aims his pedal extremity toward
a canine, says the Chicago Tribune. :
Eberts, or Bill, a^s he was known, 'was the owner of a
farm out toward'Allentown from Lynchburg, in the Turtle
Creek Valley, as nice and rich a piece of land as there was
in all Highland County. His father had left him the farm
free of lncumbrance. and It was well stocked, had good
buildings, a comfortable farmhouse, and Eberts had a con
tract with the distillery In Lynchbucg- to take care of a
certain number of cattle eacb year. ;
t ENGAGED TO A PRETTY/GIRL.
He was engaged to marry Nettie^ Welman, one of the
prettiest young women In the Dodsfinville district, whose
father was a wealthy farmer, and, on; the summer that he
first kicked a dog, she had returned from Harcourt Place.
Seminary at Gambler, Ohio, where she was finishing her
education; * . , . .: .
Eberts was a handsome, well-proportioned young man,
jolly,**'happy, and,- although a hard bargainer and a good
business mart, he was known as a good fellow.
His- sister Molly kept house for him at the Turtle Creek
farm, with the aid of a housekeeper and a servant, and
i everything might have been well but for the fact that
Â»George Tatum, who was In love with Molly and afraid to
tell her so. sent her a little, white, woolly poodle.
Eberts did not like Tatum, although he said that Molly's
love affairs were her own lookout â and still less did he
like the poodle that Tatum sent to Molly, but, as she. lav
ished a fund of affection upon it and kissed Its pink nose,
and talked baby talk to it, Eberts merely sniffed with dis
gust and went out to pet his horses.'
WHY HE KICKED. THE POODLE.
â¢ The poodle remained in the house several weeks. Then
one night Eberts came home from .Westboro, where , he
had been to look at a bunch of young steers,', tired and
disappointed over the deal, and retired to his room. Half
an hour later he was awakened by something warm licking
h,is face, and he "made a vicious slap at it. cuffing the poodle
off the bed and ordering it from the room. He fell asleep
again and was awakened by the poodle whining. Angry,
he jumped out 6t bed and to hunt the poodle, which
fled whining, aronnd the room. Eberts, feeling his way
through the 'dense darkness, with both hands outstretched
before him. walked straight against the door, which came
between h.'s outstretched hands and broke his nose.
With a cry of pain and anger, he leaped in pursuit of
the dog, to take vengeance, and, when he thought he had
it cornered, he launched out a kick and broke his great
toe against the door jamb.
Dr. Shrofe was called and set both the nose and the
toe, and thereafter Eberts declared vengeance against all
dogs.
DOGS. MAKE HIM MUCH TROUBLE.
And, odd as it may seem, every dog in that community
seemed at once to take an instinctive dislike to Eberts.
Before that they had .passed him by without notice, but
after he had declared Thimself an enemy to all dogs they
seemed to wait for an opportunity to bite . him. Before
his broken toe healed John Orebaugh's black setter ran
out and barked at Eberts' spirited horse, causing it to
bolt and wreck his new three-quarters side-bar buggy,
and he narrowly escaped death. â¢ â¢
Two months laterâ as poon as his face was presentable â
Eberts went over to call on Miss Weiraan. She received
him as lovingly as ever, and he related to her his experi
ences, she being properly sympathetic. That evening, as
he was bidding her a fond farewell, her pet dog came leap
ing around them, and Eberts, letting loose of Miss Weiman's
hand, launched a vigorous kick at the dog. The kick landed
where It did the most good and Fido fled howling around
the house.
There was a quarrel â Miss Weiman was angry and hurt

Indifference, at which we are wont to look askance,
has its noble and human side. It is not always an evi

of cool judgment and quiet nerves. .
What seems to be a lack of sympathy may be the per
fect balance of a well-poised mind that measures affairs
by wisdom's universal yardstick.. .
What passes for sympathy is often but a kind of spend

\u25a0 V FEUD RESULTS IX TWO BLACK EYES.
That only served -to intensify Eberts- anger at dogs in
general and the one in sight in particular. Only -a .^wmJ
later he | kicked Pony Dumenil's dog. In- front: o f r th e Miller
House in Lynchburg, and the fight that followed Is his
toric in that town, Eberts losing and departing for nome
with both eves blackened.
For nearly a year Eberts went on kicking every dog
that came within kicking distance; of him. trying to get
even for the harm they had done him. j Last January ne
went out to his horse barn early. in the evening to examine
ahorse that had. been- sick, and he put the lantern down
on the barn floor near the stall.-^While he was working
around the horse he heard a suspicious sniff, and saw * ran *
Davidson's* mongrel" cur at his heels. He aimed a wim
kick at, the dog. which put its tail between its legs and
lied howling down the floor, knocking over the lantern.
Eberts jumped for the lantern, but before he- could reach
it burning oil had reached the hay In the manger near
by, and five minutes -later the barn was burning furiously,
and it was with difficulty that he rescued nine of his horses,
two perishing in the Barnes. â¢
The fire spread to the' blgr.com. crib near by and only
desperate efforts by the hired then and the neighbors saved
the other , buildings.
LOSES SUIT FOR DAMAGES.
Instead' of learning a lesson of kindness from this. Eb
erts vowed he would kill every dog- he could reach, and
the following week, after kicking Colonel Payson Max
well's dog, that blooded animal turned upon him and B ave
fight, whereupon Eberts drew a revolver and killed the
dog. Colonel Maxwell brought suit and recovered damages
besides forcing Eberts to pay a heavy fine in the criminal
action that he started. -. \u25a0\'
About that time it came to be talked about all through
Dodson Township that Bill Eberts' bad luck all came from
kicking- a dog. and the dogs in that township that man
aged to elude Eberts had an easy time..for no one else ever
dared kick one for fear of bringing bad luck, down upon
his head. â¢- ' '
But Eberts himself grew only more and more bitter
against dogs. He declared that the man who Kept a dog
was a criminal and that the Legislature ought to pass a
bill making it a criminal offense for any person to own a
A few weeks ago the climax of-the strange series of
misfortunes that followed Eberts' act in kicking his sis
ter's poodle was reached. He went to Cincinnati with a
load of horses, intending to dispose of them in the Fifth
street market. He sold his horses at good prices, and. feel
ing well satisfied with the day's work, he walked down
Fountain square and stopped at the . edge of the. esplanade,
hoping to meet some mcauaintances from up in his part of
the. country who "had corae down on a $1 excursion and
who, he knew, would be around .the fountain some time
during the day. . ' ' .
BOTH OF HIS LEGSTAKEX OFF.
Rain had been falling and the esplanade was slippery.
As Eberts stood there he felt a touch on his trousers' leg,
and, turning, he saw a small.; black-and-tan terrier.snif
fing at his trousers.
Wild with rage, he turned and. kicked viciously at the
little beast. : He missed. His fooj. slipped on the wet stones
of the esplanade, he fell, slid off the esplanade and shot,
feet first, under an onrushing Covington car.
He was taken from underneath the car with both legs
crushed and the surgeons at the City Hospital amputated
both Just below the knee. .' â¢ â¢ â¢
While unconscious and all during, the operation Eberts
raved about dogs, declaring they had ."ruined his 1 life and
cast an evil spell upon him. ?No one knew what he meant
until the news of his terrible accident reached Lynchburg.
It is declared among the superstitious in that
that Eberts has been punished for kicking dogs, and, al
though many persons there deny they are superstitious,
it is' safe to say that Lynchburg and Dodsbn 'Townshipâ
and all that valley of the east fork â Is the safest place
for dogs in all the world.
MODERN COMPLEXITY
MUCH of this conversation about the simple life' is
exceedingly irksome. Anybody who. really means it
can save up enough to support him for the rest of
'.his life in the Orient. Go there and be simple
thenceforthâ they know how to do things simply there;
they have to know, or they would starve to death.
But! In twentieth-century America what earthly oppor
tunity is there to be simple? One long step toward It would
come.lf we learned to sit and sleep on the floor, like most
of the" world. Then all the. tables' we '.should need' would
not stand more than > six inches or a foot high, -chairs! and
beds would: disappear, and. with them most of the cares of
housekeeping. But who wants to sit and sleep on the
floor? And, who would dare , to, if he wanted to?
Every new invention complicates things more. Take a
household necessity,", such as the telephone has .come to
be formany . of us, and observe' the entirely new elements
it introduces into the family affairs. It brings, us into
intercourse with, an army of persons who would never
have" crossed our path otherwise; the -agent who Induced
us to put the^ machine in, the man who collects' the money
for It, . the array of young women' who answer^nir callâ
and. shame us by their politeness-^â and the still greater

THE GOOD MAX WHO FORGAVE.
'The. good man had been thinking
about it for some time. He had thought
about it earnestly, * conscientiously,
even prayerfully/ arid : at : last 1 he saw
clearly what he felt it was his duty to
do. To be sure, he realized keenly that
the other man had wronged him griev
ously, and that -not in a little but a
great matter; still he now saw his
'duty plainly and he must act In ac
cordance with It.
So, acting upon the truth revealed in
this inward vision, he sat down and
wrote a letter to the man who had
wronged him, and we are permitted to
read a brief quotation from it. ' '\u0084:
"I know," he wrote, "that you have
done me a great wrong, but as 1 hope
for forgiveness for wrongs that 1 have
done, so must I forgive. At last I see
my duty and you are forgiven â for
given freely and fully. You have not
asked for this forgiveness, but not the
less it is yours.'/
The good man sat back In his chair
and looked thoughtfully at the letter
for some time. Then he spoke lowly
unto himself.
' "It will make the cuss feel njighty
mean and small." he .said, "to get that
letter."
Then, as he rose from his chair, a
glad, triumphant smile shone upon his
placid countenance â such a smile, you
know, as we always wear when we
have shown a forgiving spirit.-^
(N. B. Don't begin to puff yourself
up with self-conceit, Rehoboam. The
man was not so lonely in his style of
forgiveness as you might. suppose.) '
LIFE INSURANCE PHILOSOPHY.

FLOWER SHOW
OPENS GAYLY
Exquisite Collections of
Chrysanthemums Delight
Visitors to Exhibition
NEW SPECIMENS ON.VIEW
Hoses, Carnations and. Fern
Trees, Native and Foreign,
Make AVondrous; Picture
The California State Floral Society and
the Pacific Coast Horticultural .Society
united yesterday in presenting to the
public a floral exhibition In the Ferry
building which fairly, surprised those who
took the opportunity to gaze upon It.
Such a scene of living chrysanthemums
has not before been shown In San Fran
cisco. Giants are they and of colors of
the richest and most varied.
While some familiar names among the
amateur cultivators are missing from the
exhibition, their places have been filled
by other worthy ones. \u25a0
Mrs. "W. H. Crocker l Is a non-competing
exhibitor, with a wealth of exquisite cac
tus dahlias, and Mrs. T. \ Sachau shows
miscellaneous . flowers. Also among the
amateurs Is James L. Flood, with collec
tions of chrysanthemums that are too
wealthy of beauty to be adequately de
scribed. -
This exhibit, like those of Chris ,W.
Smith of Menlo Park and W. S. Tevls.
wins immediate attention and was award
ed prizes. . ;
The iirofessional class has contributed
specimens that seem to have reached
perfection under cultivation. Tall, grace
ful fern trees of Australia, maiden-hair
fern, the stately Morton Bay pine (Arau
caria Bidwelli), also of Australia, shown
by the Cox Seed Company, is a wonder
ful beauty as it towers over a gracefully
formed stand of decorative plants. It
grows to a height of 200 feet. ,
CULTIVATED BEAUTIES.
There are perfectly cultivated Aspidis
tra lurida and the sago palm and I the
wintry-looking Elaeagnus aurea and the
Odontoglossum, which is com
\u2666monly called the Chinese baby orchid.
Also among the 'orchids, which are so
generally admired, will be found the
Odontoglossum crispum, a perfect beauty.
Standing side by side with the remark
ably fine exhibit of the Cox Seed Com
pany is that of H. Plath, who, among
other exhibits, has a beautiful collection
of decroative ' greenhouse plants.!
Plath's ferns are a treat' to look upon,
as are the coleus shown by> G. W. Bagge.
The carnation exhibit and other speci
mens, by John H. Sievers & Co., and the
great violets and plants from -the Red
wood City Nursery, add to the wealth
of the floral display.
Those who will be looking for the nov
elties of the season in chrysanthemums
must make a straight line for the C. W.
Smith exhibit, which has to its credit no
less than seventy-rlve varieties, among
them being the "Fidelity" (American),
"Mildred Glyne" (American), "Beauty of
Leigh" (English), "Lady Talbot" (Aus
tralian) and "Alliance" (French). Some
of the blooms of the Flood chrysanthe
mums measure eight inches across. In
the Tevis collection of cyclamen will be
found a new variety called the "Papllio."
Domoto Bros, once more appear with
a splendid exhibit of Japanese plants,
carnations, chrysanthemums and roses.
The Plath roses, too, are wonders to be
hold.
Take it altogether, San Francisco Is
being graced with the rarest and most In
comparable specimens of the floral wealth
and beauty of the neighborhood, brought
to perfection by amateur and professional
gardeners, by skilled and unskilled hands.
The judgesâ John McLaren, superintend
ent of Golden Gate Park; Sidney Clack,
Menlo Park, and Charles Abraham of San

MILK SUPPLY
IS STILL GOOD
City Cliemist Reports Only
a Few Samples Show Vio
lation of Pure Food Law
DEALER USES GELATINE
Fails to Profit by Lesson
of Arrest of Two Dairymen
Who Adulterated Cream
If the analysis of milk samples, accord-
Ing- to a report filed yesterday with the
Board of Health by City Chemist Gibbs,
is any indication, the publicity given
by the newspapers to' the fact that un
principled * dealers were putting: poison
ous compounds in their milk has result
ed in practically a pure milk supply for
San Francisco, at least for the present.
The report shows that out of forty-six
samples analyzed only six were found to
be what they ought not to; be. Despite
the fact that two dealers were arrested
last week for putting gelatine in their
cream, P. Morgensen of 3087 Sixteenth
street did not take the lesson to heart be
cause Gibbs puts him down in the report
as having gelatine In a sample of cream
taken from his wagon. . â
A sample of milk taken from Murphy
& Paul of 123 Sixth , street was labeled
"borated" as the law requires. \u25a0 A sam
ple from Lelpslc Brothers of .1421, Bu
chanan street contained both detritus and
pus. A sample from the Guad a loupe
Dairy, owned by O. Crook of- 1814 San
Bruno avenue, contained only detritus or
ordinary dirt. Another from McLellan &
Guthrie's Durham Farm of 236 Sixth ave
nue had red blood cells and pus' ln it ac
cording to Gibbs' report. A sample from
the Jersey Farm of G. Sneath contained
detritus, and one from the Merced Dairy,
submitted by Rev. Mr. Coplen of 2402
Bush had but 2.6 per cent butter fat, or
6-1Q per cent less than the law requires.
The sample had begun to sour when it
was analyzed. . -
Samples from Benedict Brothers of the
Jersey â¢ Ranch and - Leipsic Brothers had
3.3 per cent butter fat. As that Is but
one-tenth above what it ought to be
Health Officer Reagan will send notices
to the concerns to be careful not to let
It go below. All the other samples an
alyzed were, free of any foreign substance
and nearly all were considerably above
the standard fixed by law. From the re
port It would appear that dairymen have
awakened to the necessity of eithef sup
plying pure milk or suffering exposure for
violating the pure food law.

000 basalt blocks will be required. J. J.
Dowlins has the contract for- the Work
and will experience some difficulty owing
to the fact that the -various quarries jin
the. vicinity of San Francisco are only
able to turn out 100,000 basalt blocks . per
month.. Of . these the City Improvement
Company.' takes . 50,000 for its own uses,
and not counting the demand from other
contractors, it would seem that Dowllng
can only succeed in getting 800,000 blocks
in six months.
The Board of Works plans to use the
old basalt blocks which are to be taken
up*on Valencia street, which Is to be
bltumlnized.v for the paving of Mission
street,, so the city will be in a position
to pave a portion of Mission street at
least despite the scarcity of basalt blocks.
The cement dealers are unable to supply
the demand for cement, and this will
cause further delay in proposed Improve
ments, i
City Engineer Woodward has filed spec
ifications for the bituminizing of Mission
street from Porter avenue to the county
line at a cost of $9250, and the work will
be ordered at once.
Woodward has reported against the ap
plication df the Southern Paciflo Com
pany that Eureka street between P street
south and Dunshee street be closed. A
similar application for the closing of
Dunshee street waa also denied recently.
The Ocean Shore Railway Company pe
titioned that alleged obstructions at the
corner of Regent street and San Jose ave
nue be removed, as they were on thÂ© line
of the proposed electric road running to
Santa Cruz. Mrs. Jehl proved to the sat
isfaction of the Board of Works that the
fence complained of is well within her
own property, as Regent street is only
forty feet wide instead of sixty feet, as
claimed by the company.
' KICKED BY HORSE.â Fred Olsen. a stable
man, residing at 149S Pacific street, was kicked
by a vicious horse yesterday afternoon. Olsen
was kicked In \ the abdomen while ' fixing the
/harness. He wag treated by Dr. Goodale at
the Central Emergency Hospital. The Injuries
are serious.

It was give away day with Umpire Jack
McCarthy yesterday at the Eighth street
lot. He gave the Biwashes the game,
gave Whalen and Wilson the rush and
he gave the crowd the laugh. He was
the main event and the real attraction.
He would have given some one a million
dollars, but be did not have it on his
clothes.
The third inning was the gift inning.
Christmas was never like that. When a
ball team can Ret a run and the game as
easily s.s the Siwashes got that one yes
terday, it's no use playing.. With a man
.out ten feet from the plate the umpire was
gazing in another direction, and because
lie was the Seals got second money.
Vickers was the man who got some
thing for nothing. He started the inning
when Mohler fumbled his grounder and
Bennett was also safe on Wheeler's boot.
Kano'e out put both up a notch and
Blar.kenshlp responded with one that was
easy for Wheeler. Georgie winged the
ball to the plate. Shea was waiting for
Vickrrs and was already taking off his
sweater and getting ready to go to work.
While all this was coming off McCarthy
vas taking a look at first base. He fig
ured the play would come off there, as
two were In the cellar. But it all hap
pened at the plate and the umpire forgot
to gaze in that direction, so the run
eeored and it proved to be the one that
brought victory home.
Jimmy Whalen naturally remonstrated
and uttered a few unbiblical quotations.
For this he was chased to the bench.
Later on Parke Wilson came back with
a little line of talk, of which McCarthy
did not approve. He also got his. Hltt
came In to pitch and the Slwashes could
not negotiate another one after that.
Big Rube Vickers did not have anything
outside of a toe plate, a glove and a
cmlle, but these were the goods, for the
Seals only grabbed three hits. They got
their run in the fourth when Householder
bit off a double to the score board and
JCick Williams chopped a torrid bounder
along the first base line that went for
three bags. The hit and run play was
then tried, but it went wrong and Wil
litms died between third and home.
Charley Irwin was out of the game on
eccount of the death of his brother.
"Wheeler was stationeu at third and Wil
liams got into the game at the Initial
eack. The score:

TIGERS FALL IN FOURTEENTH.
Smith Scores the Only -( Rob With a
Single to Center.
! LOS ANGELES. Nov. 9.â ln a four
! teen-inning pitchers' battle between
Tozer and Keefe. one of the best ex
hibitions of baseball ever seen on the
local diamond, Los Angeles won from
Taeoma to-day by scoring a single run
in the last half of the final inning. The
pitching of both men was superb. Keefe
allowed but five hits in the fourteen
Innings, while the visitors got nine off
Tozer. but they were so well scattered
that there were no hopes of runs. All
of the hits made were singles. The
fielding of both sides was perfect, with
the exception of one wild throw to first
by Keefe, which resulted in a batter
reaching second base, but in no way
affecting the score. Spectacular stops,
running catches and perfect throws
were too numerous to take account of.
The only run of the game was made
when Spies was sent to- bat for Tozer in
the last half of the fourteenth. He
was given a base on balls and, Good
win running for him, reached second
on Bernard's sacrifice and went to third
on Middleton's out at first. Smith then
singled to center and Goodwin came
home with the winning run. Flood was
put out of the game in the first inning
by Umpire Davis for protesting against
a decision on strikes. Middleton took
his place and played perfectly. Score:

Dunleavj- Called Ont at Plate Tryingr
to Steal Home.
OAKLAND, Nov. 9. â Portland was
presented with the game at Idora Park
this afternoon by the combination of
a bad decision by Umpire "Bull" Per
lne and a balloon ascension by Oscar
Graham. The latter went up in the air
in the fourth, after his team had made
five runs in the preceding inning, and
by allowing: five hits, let the Webfoot-,
ers tie the score. Graham was then
sent to the bench, and Hogan was sent
in to. save the game.
Van Haltren then sent Hopkins, a
bush .leaguer, in to pitch, and the
youngster proved a' most welcome sur
prise, shutting Portland out without a
hit in the last three innings of the
game. y

Ferd Owens Heads Big Party
From New Yorkâ Bill Hen
ry Joins Western Colony
As ths date for the opening of the rac
ing season approaches, turfmen are ar
riving in clusters from the Eastern coun
try. Looking rotund and. happy Barney
Schrelber, the big St. Louis breeder and
bookmaker, stepped off the train from
Los Angeles yesterday, at which city he
spent a couple of days looking over his
Ascot Park string. Barney is one' of the
most popular men that ever chalked up
a orice at any of . the tracks, and as he
did not pay San Francisco a visit last
season, was kept busy shaking hands
with old friends last night. He has a
large stable of horses in training at Oak
land and says he' will cut In to-morrow.
Declarations for the Opening handicap
are due to-day. \ There promises to be a
blsr field, the list of probable starters to
gether with their riders having been pub
lished in yesterday's issue of The Call.
Ferd Owens, who will make en
gagements for. Jockey Sam Greenfield
this winter, was numbered among an ex
tended party that reached here on last
evening's overland train. Among the
others were Bill Henry, bookmaker and
handicapper of renown, Frank Jones, Al
Rostern of New York and Jerry Daly.
Harry Green of Spokane, owner of
Royalty, Ebel Thatcher and Miss Spo
kane and others, "kicked in" yesterday.
Harry is one of the leading sporting men
of the Northwest and a good bettor.
Sam Stine. who booked at all of the

BATTLING NELSON BOWS
TO DAN CUPID'S WILES
Dane Announces Engage
ment to Marguerite Be
langero of Fairfax.
CINCINNATI, Nov. 9.â Cupid has won
where left Jabs failed. ' Battling Nelson,
the fighter, confessed to-day to having
taken the count and being unable to rally.
Nelson has been here doing a sparring
turn with a theatrical company and be
came confidential to-day, ' telling of his
engagement f Or the first time.
The young woman in question is Miss
Marguerite Belangero of Fairfax, Cal. She
Is only 15 years old, but Bat says he is
willing to wait until she grows up.
"You can't beat her. for- looks," said
Nelson, as he tried to draw a -word pic
ture of his , lady love, but found her
charms too great for deserlptlon. There
is only one point of difference between
Nelson and Nolan, his manager, and that
is this question of marriage. .
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 9.â Miss Marguerite
Belangero, the brider to-be of Battling
Nelson, Is a handsome, slender blonde
born in Italy fifteen years ago. She has
resided here with her father, Giussepi Be
langero, who has been interested in La
Boheme Villa for the past eight ' years.
Nelsons-c ourtship was arduous and per
sistent. He could not desist while train
ing for theÃritt fight. He would go horse
back riding nightly with her. This was
the principal reason why Nolan secured
training quarters at Colma so abruptly;
as he believed courting unessential to
fighting training. J

for Devotees
of Sport
The annual > intercollegiate
football -game between the Uni
versity of California and Stan
ford University, the climax of
the season's sport of the grid
iron on the Pacific Coast, will
be fittingly recorded by the
cleverest writers for . ThÂ£
Cali/s readers.
All the life and color and ac
tion, which go to make this
football game a thrilling ' spec
tacle, and which invariably up
set the placidity of the most
blase spectator, will be vividly
pictured. .
Leigh H. Irvine, one of the
beat known . of descriptive
writers, will depict the scenes
about the huge amphitheater
while the athletes' struggle for
supremacy is in progress. Mr.
Irvine brings a graceful" style to
his task. He has gained fame
as a South Sea writer, his
book, "An Affair of the South
'Seas" having enjoyed a wide
vogue. He is also the author
of "Told in Whispers" and of
a number. of. sketches and es
says, which have appeared in
"The Arena" and \u25a0- in other
prominent magazines.
To Park Winslow, a member
of one of Amherst College's
greatest football elevens, has
been intrusted the important
duty of describing the work of
the players on the field. He will"
watch every play- with the eyes
of an expert, and his contri
bution will prove interesting
both to college man and to out
sider alike.
Assisting these writers in col
lecting all the news regarding
the game will.be E. B. Favre,
Glenn Byers, D. H. Walker Jr.
and E. L. Houchins.
E* A. Rogers, The Call's,
competent photographer, will be
present to catch the sensational
plays and record them on his
negative, to be handed down to
future generations of football
men.
Of paral lei importance to the
football game will'be >the open
ing of the great winter season
of racing at Emeryville under
the auspices of the California
Jockey Club. The Call is
again fortunate in securing the*
services of Fred E. Mulhol land,
one ;of the cleverest of Amer
ican turf writers : and widely. ]
known as a racing official
throughout the country. Mr.
Mulholland, in addition to pos- .
sessing a thorough knowledge
of the'form of the horses, writes
of their struggles in a particu
larly entertaining style, which :
appeals to all lover? of the
thoroughbred. V

CARDINAL'S LAST PRACTICE.
Great Throne of Students Witnesses
Work of the Blf Eleven.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 9.â
The Varsity squad was given a rousing
send off at the last practice this after
noon. The band headed the throng of
students who went to the new .field to
witness the work. As this is the first
time any outsider has j been admitted to
the gridiron in two weeks, except for. the
opportunity offered by the game with
Southern California last Saturday,
changes in the lineup and new plays were
eagerly looked for. â¢ Nor were the fans
disappointed. The speed and team work
which the eleven athletes went through
without a single hitch was pleasing to the
spectators. The appearance of the squad
added to the plcturesquencss of the occa
sion and gave the enthusiastic students
some line as to the appearance they will
present when they go upon the field Sat
urday. Every man had on a suit which
bespoke newness in every fold. The line
up, which will probably be final, was:
Koerner, left end; Horton, left tackle;
R. A. Thompson, left guard; Molflno, cen
ter; Frizzell, right guard; Crawford, right
tackle; Lyons, right end; Stott, quarter;
Chalmers, full back;' Dole, right half
back; Vandervoort, left naif back. . . *.
The final rally and windup of the foot
ball season at Stanford was held to
night in the assembly hall. Enthusiasm
ran riot. All co-eds and students were
there in force, and the way the rafters of
the building resounded with the varsity
and new prize yell was a revelation. It
is estimated that the. number to
this last gathering before- the big game
constituted one of the largest and most
enthusiastic rallies in the annals of the
cardinal. . . â¢ .
After listening to words of advice and
encouragement from members of the fa
culty, coaches, Dad Moulton and promi
nent students, the throng broke into a
rollicking serpentine dance about the
"quad." When all had made the circuit
the leaders turned -their steps toward the
baseball diamond, where an immense
bonfire had been built in the afternoon
by the freshman class. Around the blaz
ing mass the students sang songs to ( their
alma mata j and shouted themselves
hoarse* in praise of the cardinal and their
eleven moleskin clad heroes. \u25a0..
COACH KNIBBS IS CHEERED.
Receives a Warm Reception From Stu
dent* at the Last Bis Rally.
BERKELEY, Nov. 9.â The climax of
the rally season at the university came
to-night, when 100 students gathered
for the big smoker rally in Harmon
Gymnasium and heard football stars
and football coaches ; talk of the big
game on Saturday and "what California
is going to do to the cardinal."
The fact that Coach Knibbs and his
assistant, Dr. Griffin, had been .an
nounced to speak attracted a greater
crowd of students than ordinarily
would have been present. Coach
Knibbs received a big reception and
was cheered as few, coaches at Cali
fornia have been cheered during the
last twenty years. Knibbs has the con
fidence and support of the team and- the
"rooters" beyond doubt and that fact
is expected -\u25a0 to be an important factor
in the contest on Saturday.
Captain : - Force, â¢ Trainer j Christie â¢ and
others of the football contingent were
on the list of speakers to-night and with
Bong and storyJ and , talk the rally, was
matie 'memorable -in : the -history^ of
similar rallies in college.
To-morrow night Coach Knibbs is ex
pected; to make knownthe personnel of
the team that will line ;up : against
Stanford on Saturday. It is not likely
any material I change will \u25a0be made in
the team which \u25a0: has been - generally
conceded to have the â¢ call in Knibbs'
affections, this team being made up .of
the nine veterans from last ~ year and
"Whitman and 'Bush among the new

ASK CHAMBER
TO CO OP ERATE
Denver ( Commercial Bodies
Propose to This Coast
to Hold a ConVention
OPPOSE FREE 'SUGAR
Production of Philippines
Interests Beet Growers
of Middle West States
'An Invitation has been received by
the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce to co-operate with the Den
ver Chamber of Commerce and
Denver Board of Trade to have
a convention to represent the in
terests of the beet sugar growing
States to oppose legislation to put
sugar from the Philippines on the free
list. Xo action has been taken in this
city yet in response to the invitation.
Commercial organizations In all the
beet sugar producing States have been
invited to co-operate. The text of the
Invitation Is as follows:
The Denver Chamber of Commerce and Board
of Trade : was organised to promote tha mate
rial prosperity of Denver ana the varied indus
tries of Colorado, and is especially Interested
in the growth of sugar beets, as it affects the
prosperity of the agricultural community of tha
entire West. .
In 18S3 there were 555 tons of best sugar
manufactured in the United States; in l&U,
209.722 tcms. This industry, although in its
infancy, already furnishes about 20 per cent
of the sugar consumed in tale country, and if
hostile legislation is not enacted it seems like
ly in a few years to furnish one-half of the to
tal i amount consumed, ana thus keep at home
hundreds of millions of dollars now sent to
foreign countries.
In Colorado no crop has yielded as profitable
and sure a return to the farmer as that of the
sugar beet. The town property, where tha
factories are located, and the farming lands
surrounding the came have doubled in value,
asd .the vast earns paid out annually to tha
fanners for beets, to tha local op-= raters and
qnarrymen for fuel and linierock, tha sums paid
for factory labor and to tha Colorado railroads
for freight, have entered so widely Into circu
lation that the entire Stats la feeling the bene
fit thereof. We Judge that the other States
producing beet EUgar \u25a0 have received similar
benefits. We faar anything that will interfere
with this Industry, and view with alarm the
proposal on tha part of tr.s national Govern
ment to remove tha tariff upon sugar coming
from the Philippine Islands. .
We believe that the time is very opportune
to call a conference or a convention of repre
sentatives of the leading commercial bodies of
the sugar producing States to take action look
ing toward a correct public opinion on this im
portant subject, and also to secure tha assist
ance of thÂ« Representatives -In Congress from
the above States in preventing such tariff leg
islation.
Will you kindly advlsa us whether your hon
orable body will co-operate with us and send a
representative \u25a0to euch a convention, the date
of the meeting to be announced later? -

Cronin denies that he had anything to
do with setting the barns on fire. He
says he used to work for Graham, but
another man got his Job, and he wanted
to see if he could not be taken back. That
was why he was seen around the place..
HEMPMLL WILLS
NOWINPEOBATE
Contest Sure to Follow the
Offering of Two
Rev. Dr. John Hemphlll, pastor
of Calvary Presbyterian. church,
has filed for probate two wills left by his
wife, the late Mrs. Lizzie J. Hemphil!
One of the instruments is dated 1537 and
the other was drawn one year prior to
that time. The testament bearing the
latter date is the one of which a copy
was offered for probate and j afterward
contested at tha behest of the : deceased's
daughter, Mrs. -Mary Daniel of London,
England. It was this will that was miss
ing until some weeks when . It - was
found in a bureau drawer at the Hemp
hill residence. Judge Coff ey refused .to
admit the â¢ copy filed to probate on the
ground that it was not the original docu
ment. Thereupon Mrs. Daniel dropped
the contest she had Instituted and asked
for a partial distribution of the property.
The last testament, which was found in
the dresser drawer, leaves the property to
Mrs. Daniel in trust for her children In
case she ceased to live with her husband.
So long as she remained with her husband
the property was 'to go to^Dr. Hemphill
in trust for the daughter's-, children.
However, there was an annoying penalty
attached to this distribution of the estate,
for it was provided that Dr. Hemphlll
should order the going and coming of his
two grandchildren/^and further provided
that they should reside with him or in
such place as he should deem advisable.
-When the original will was discovered
it was intimated by those representing
Mrs. Daniel that in case it should be
offered for probate a contest would be
instituted on the ground that the admis
sion of the instrument to probate would
be contrary to good morals and public
policy. It -is asserted that Mrs. Daniel's
attorneys have been Instructed to Insti
tute a contest forthwith.
Lit Is supposed that the reason for re
cording both wills is for the purpose of
holding the first document In reserve In
case the latter will should be declared
Invalid.
REBUKE IS ADMIMSTEBED
TO ATTORNEY H. A. KROUSE
Judge Dunne Refuses to Delay Argra
j meat on Application for Writ
of Habeas Corpus.
/The application for a writ of habeas
corpus for the release of Attorney H.
A. Krouse, who was ordered Into ' cus
told by Judge Graham for contempt of
court,' came up for hearing before
Judge Dunne yesterday morning." : At
torney J. C Keegan, who j represented
Krouse, asked for a continuance of
two weeks. ";- .
Judge Dunne said that the purpose
of applying for a : writ of habeas" cor
pus was- to -get the prisoner released as
speedily as possible. He would . refuse
to grant a longer continuance than till
to-day.
"I am really in the custody of the
Sheriff now," said Krouse, but the
Judge interrupted him by, telling him
he could address the court through his
counsel.
Keegan began to attack the action of
Judge Graham, but { Judge | Dunne ] told
him that he ; would i not i review the ac
tion^ of -? another Jud^e of ,the â¢ Superior
Court ; and * ordered -a 7 continuance ~- till

SUPPLY FBO3I COYOTE
Plant With Fifty Million
Gallons Daily 5 Draft for
Â§25,000,000 AU Complete
In the suit of the Spring Valley Water
Works to restrain the city and county of
San ' Francisco from enforcing thÂ© water
rate schedule adoDted. for 1303, City At
torney Percy V. Long and City Expert
John H. Doekweiler placed Edwin Dor
yea Jr. upon the stand yesterday In
United States Commissioner Heacock's
court. Mr. Duryea U chief engineer of
the Bay Cities Water Company, a busi
ness rival of the complainant.
The catchment area of the Bay Cities
Water Company's system, he said, em
braced 3SSO acres, which would supply an
average dally draft, with the reservoir
capacities 'available, of 5a,50Q,000 gallons.
The cost of all the dams and other struc
ture* necessary ' to Improve these reser
voir sites and to complete them ready to
impound the tributary waters would bÂ«
|3,506,000; that of reservoir sites and
catchment areas Ji.rCO.MO. making a total
of JS,lÂ£"3,C'Â». The cost of a double pipe
line from Coyote to San' Francisco, in
cluding Belmont pumping station, would
bo $5,235.000 with the best quality of con
struction, making a total of %ISJUIJQOD as
the entire" cost of the Bay Cities Water
Company's Santa Clara County system,
with works complete to store enoegh wa
ter to give an average daily draft of 50.-
OOO.tXW gallons In the dryest years, with
two riveted lron j pipe lines to carry the
same to San Francisco. This estimate In
cludes the ownership of the entire moun
tain catchment area. The distributing
system for San Francisco j would cost
59A07.000 additional, making a grand total
for the complete system of C5,451^}Q0.
In response to a question^ by City Attor
ney Long the witness said that the Bay
Gitles Water Company would construct
the system for the city for that sum. On
this estimate the rate of cost per daily
draft per million gallons would be $300,000.
A similar system to supply 35,000.000 gal
lons daily could be furnished for $17,
515.C00. * .
The witness spoke of another catch
ment area of 400 square miles in the high
Sierras between Placervllle and Lake Ta
hoe, on the south fork of the American
River and the north fork of the Co
sumnes River. This would be sufficient ta
supply 200,000,000 gallons per day and 25,
000 horsepower, which could be used In
pumping the water and in furnishing
electric lights for this city. This project,
he added, is now under control of the
Bay Cities Water Company and is being
investigated by engineers on behalf of tha
city and county of San Francisco. . This
system can be constructed and acquired
for less than the proposed Tuolumne sys
tem.
The hearing will be resumed next Mon
day at 10 a. m. -V

bflt later admitted the shooting and
claimed , that it was an accident. The
case attracted considerable interest, ow
ing to the fact that the 15-year-old daugh
ter of the murdered man, whom Grill
claimed to be in love with, was one of the
principal witnesses for the prosecution.
A motion for a new trial was denied, but
a writ of probable cause was allowed,
that an appeal might be taken to the Su
preme Oourt.

STATE OF TRADE,
A Wall-Street Opinion of Current Bnal
ne*a Conditions.'
, Henry Clews or. New York says of general
trade:
"Business conditions continue very promis
ing. Great activity Is reported la all sections
of the country, keeping money actively em
ployed and suggesting firm rates for weeks to
ecme. In almost every aepartment of lndus
\u25a0 trial, commercial or financial activity records
have been dally broken, tt Is quite safe to
Â«ay that the volume of trade during the pres
ent year far surpasses all other yeare In the
history of the country. There are signs hero
*nd thera of it* approaching end;
end yet the ' relative absence of dan
*jerouÂ« speculation, tae unquestionably
rapid development of our natural re
sources, the great growth In population and
the a,bsence thus far of any general elgns of
overproduction give confidence in the belief
that we are to enjoy at least another year of
â¢general proeperity. The wonderful demand for
Iron Is an old. old story, jet it Is still the most
convincing proof which w.e have of healthy
conditions. The great Steel Corporation haa
orders en feaJid or In signt which w*ll keep It
fully occupied for the next twelve months.
*nd it could easily employ a very â¢ substantial
increase to Its present capacity. Real estate is
*iÂ»o enjoying a boom which has never yet been
â¢quaied. Usually, activity in this quarter
marks thÂ« culmination \u25a0of an upward wave;
but as yet there are no El^ns of overdoing, and
the demands for Increased office, home and
workshop accommodation are the legitimate
consequence of our natural growth and pros
perity... \u0084
"In . fact, considering the vast volume "of
business and traffic, the amount of speculation
In force Is not excessive. This is partly be
cause, of & restraining Influence exercised by
cur leading bankers, who keenly recognize that
the gre&tect danger of the moment is the out
break of & speculative craze. Attempts have
. been made too often to infuse unnatural activi
ty aad strength into low grade securities And
those of questionable value. When stocks that
were given away a few years' ago am a bonus
to promoters are celling in the -3Cs and 40s it
in time to call a halt; ana when the best in
\u25a0 vestments are tellir.g en a 3% to 4 .per cent
liasls ana good railroad etocke et a level where
they bring a much inferior return to money.
there -Is little basis for any prolonged bull
movement unless prosperity brings them etlll
better returns and increased dividends. later on.
Such manipulations as have been seen in Road-
Ing' and a few other shares are a menace and
not a support to the market. ...
"The outlook of thÂ« etocx market is hopeful,
for legitimate conditions are sound and in fa
vor of a good market. Technical conditions are,
however, somewhat unsettled. Certain specu
lative Interests are actively at work for higher
prices, enabling eotne holders to quietly dJ
ir,ln!sh their load at prices which afford <Â»x
ceexHnjrly handsome profits. -This disposition to
â¢ecr<tly unload the industrials is perhaps tine
ot the most undesirable features- in the Â«lfua
tion. especially as such stocks are gradually
drifting into weaker hands."

erable precautionary liquidation. Especially at
the low rate of return offered by many stocks
at the high price level now' ruling the high
call money rate proves burdensome for mar
ginal holders. With \u25a0 the heavy drain on the
cash reserves of the banks and their consequent
reduction toward the le*al reserve limit the
backs found themselves under the necessity of
cutting down the deposit account by the with
drawal of some of their outstanding credits.
The calling of loans on the exchange was on
a large scale and the seeking of fresh accom
modations on the part of those thus displaced
caused a very actlvÂ« money market and some
forced liquidation of stock boldjf.gs. The rate
of 15 per cent touched during the day had
been reached only momentarily and that but
once in March 1903, since December of 1902.
During the early hours of the day the presence
in ,WaJl street of the Secretary of the Treasury
gave rise to a confident assumption in specula
tive circles that Government measures for the
relief of the money market were in contempla
tion. Such measures would presumably take
the form of deposits of portions of the Gov
trnment surplus revenues at the banks. This
confidence prompted some of the holders of se
curities to defer the renewal of - loan* called
during the morning with the Idea that a later
announcement of the Government measures to
be taken would cause an easier tone In the
money market. No such announcement was
forthcoming and disclaimers were made of any
purpose to take such steps. With the dis
appointment of the earlier hope that there Â«aÂ«
something like a rush among belated borrow
ers, this was said to account for the severity of
the stringency developed. Money continued to
jro out of New York in large volume. $600,000
being deposited at the subtreasury for trans
fer to Chicago and New Orleans. About half
as much was received from San Francisco by
the same process. Foreign exchange weak
ened decidedly under the stress Â«of the local
money situation and New York exchange at
Chicago also recovered sharply- All three of
the great European banks at London. Paris and
Berlin showed very strong recuperation, al
though the money market at those centers
ebowed no relaxation. The time money market
here uas called firm, but there was practically
no transactions made in that department, the
fcigh ruling rate for call loans diverting all
available funds to that department. It was
said that considerable repayments are now
being made of mercantile borrowings made,
earlier in the year to make purchases of com
modities In anticipation of the very active
fall trade. In connection with the talk of re
liof for the money market by. the United
6tates Treasury it was pointed out that the
Government bond refunding under the offer of
the Secretary of the Treasury has come prac
tically to a standstill, although the refunding
thus offered opens the way for considerable ex
pansion of the note Issue privileges of the
banks. The failure to take advantage of the
opportunity would be likely to constitute .an
argument against offering other facilities on
the part of the Government authorities." Dur
ing the frequent, rallies of the early part of
to-day Reading and other recent speculative
favorites w<Â»re bid up eharply and at one time
when the presence of Secretary Shaw on Wall
street wa* firrt reported, the average level of
the whole market ro*e above yesterday's clog-,
lag. Last prices, however, were but slightly
Â«b:n-e the lowest and showed net declines . of
1 to over 3 points throughout the llet.
Bond* were heavy. Total sales, par value,
53.375.e00.
United States new 4s declined 34 per cent

New York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. 9. â The eharp recovery
in the cotton - market to-day attests the
strength of underlying market conditions or>
existing sentiment in . regard to the general
trade conditions and the uncertain: outlook
for the crop. There was continued heavy
liquidation by old bulls and j prominent Wall
street houses on the advance, but offerings
continued well absorbed throughout the entire
session, and it was not until' after the last
hour that there was a setback to amount to
anything. The course of the' market for to
morrow will \u25a0 depend on the character of the
Government crop report. \u25a0 It made the ' con
dition a month ago 71.2 per cent. The dry
goods business is still increasing its prices.
Liverpool showed wonderful strength and
there was an excellent demand for spots, both
here and abroad, spinners having been caught
short of raw material and having awakened
to the fact that the farmer; is j chief price
maker of this 1905 crop, and as - long as the
spot demand, keeps up traders do not expect
much decline In the future options.
The weather conditions are unfavorable 'for
the greater portion of the cotton belt. Since
October 19 the belt, has been visited with
occasional â¢ frosts, which have : : retarded â¢ the
growth. 1 Killing frosts have occurred In some
districts and cold, damp rains \u25a0 have' occurred
to-day over a large part of ' the belt. '* Should
a killing trost,occur now it will be disastrous.
The weather predictions for to-night are cold
rains .in .many States. In ' Northern Â° Texas
there will not be more than half a crop.' \u25a0â¢\u25a0 v

MANY TEACHERS
TO VISIT CITY
The National Educational Association
will hold its annual convention of ISO 6 in
San Francisco, from July 9 to 13. The
executive committee of the association
has accepted the invitation, which was
extended by citizens last spring through
the efforts of the California Promotion
Committee.
The importance of this announcement to
San Francisco cannot be overestimated,
for it means the centering here of the
greatest educational association In the
worldâ that of the school teachers of the
United States.
In response to a request that this city's
claims to the convention should be recog
nized a committee of the national asso
ciation, composed of Nathan C. Schaef
fer, president. Treasurer Wilkinson and
Secretary Shepard, visited the Pacific
Coast on a tour of inspection last 'month.
At Los Angeles George O. Brehm of the
California Promotion Committee met the
visitors and escorted them to this city.
They were shown all of the points of
interest around the bay, -were fully ad
vised of . the city's capabilities to handle
a- large crowd and were entertained by
many of the leading educators of this
State. The committee estimated that if
San Francisco were selected not less than
25,000 persons would come from the East,
while 10.000 more could be expected from
coast points.
Assurance was given the visitors that
most liberal arrangements would be
made for the entertainment of the asso
ciation. From San Francisco the com-

GRANITE SHAFT
FOR HEROES
An entertainment is being planned by"
the Pacific squadron, partly to help raise
a fund to be used in erecting a monument
on Point Loma in memory of the crew
of the ill-fated United States steamer
Bennington, blown up in the harbor of
San Diego several months ago. Part of
the funds realized will go to the Sailors'
Club at Vallejo. The affair will be
held at the ' Alhambra Theater on No
vember 20, and an excellent programme
will be offered.
. Similar affairs are being planned in
various parts of the State, and army and
navy circles have taken a deep interest
in the matter. \u25a0 .
In a circular" letter issued' by Comman
der-ln-Chief Goodrich he says that a
suitable monument should be erected in
the military cemetery where the bodies
of the unfortunate seamen rest. He be
lieves that a plain granite shaft, as lofty
as practicable, mounted on a commanding
site in view of ships entering: the harbor,
would be an appropriate way of honoring
the departed.
It is estimated that the shaft will cost
$5000, and an additional JlOOO will be
needed for the caring of the^ graves.

THE STAKE
Edna Wallace Hopper Opens
Final Battle to Secure
One Half of Immense Es
tate of Her Stepfather
HIS MOTHEft ASKS
FOR THE RESIDUE
Bill in Equity Follows De
cision of Supreme Court
Denying a Reliearihg of
Proceedings in . Probate
Edna Wallace Hopper, of comic opera
fame, has marshaled her -forces \u25a0 for a
last fight for half of the $8,000,000 estate
left by her late stepfather, Alexander
Dunsmuir. Joined with her in an effort
to 6ecure the other half is Jean Olive
Dunsmuir, mother of the dead capitalist.
On behalf of the claimants, a â¢ bill In
equity was filed in this; city yesterday to
declare v"sld the will of the deceased, ad
mitted .to probate in British Columbia,
and to set aside the proceeding's in this
city whereby an authenticated copy of
the testament was' admitted to probate by
Judge Troutt and letters testamentary
Issued thereunder. V.
The filing of the bill in equity was the
sequel of a decision, handed down by the
Supreme Court denying a rehearing of
the proceedings in which a writ of pro
hibition was issued against Probate Judge
Coffey, commanding him to forever stay
the proceedings in his court, in which he
set aside Judge Troutt's order admitting
the authenticated copy of decedent's will
to probate, and directing that ' the origi
nal will be removed from the records of
British Columbia and offered here for
probate.
The sensational feature of the action
instituted yesterday is that Attorney
Mountford "Wilson of the firm of Wilson
& Wilson, representatives of James Duns
muir, sole devisee under the will of his
deceased brother, Alexander Dunsmuir. is
directly accused of fraud and . flagrant
violation 1 of the ethics of 'his profession.
After setting iorth in detail the facts
surrounding the admission to probate of
the original will in British Columbia and
a copy of the same in this city, the
complainants say: . \u25a0 . ,
FACTS OF LITIGATIOX.
At the time of his death Alexander. Dunsmuir
left him surviving as his. next of kin and heir
at law the plaintiff, Joan Olive Dunsmuir. his
mother, and his wife, Josephine Dunsmuir, v the
mother of the plaintiff. Edna Wallace Hopper.
Josephine Dunsmuir died June 2*A 1901,
testate in the State of California. Edna Wal
lace Hopper, the plaintiff, is the daughter and
heir at law of Josephine Dunsmulr, deceased,
and Is a legatee and devisee under the will
of Josephine Dunsmulr and, interested In the
estate of Josephine Dunsniuir and ias such
legatee and devisee is interested in the estate
of Alexander Dunsmulr, deceased.
Subsequent to February 24, 1SK)O, the defend
ant, James Dunsmutr, procurred â¢an authenti
cated copy of the alleged will and the probate
thereof In British Columbia - and transmitted
the same to Messrs. Wilson & Wilson, attor
neys at law In San Frandlsco, who were then
acting as legal advisers for Josephine Duns
mulr, with the instruction to file . the same
in the Superior Court of the city and county
of San Francisco with the petition for tlie
probate thereof as a foreign will and for the
appointment of the defendant as executor, of
the will in the State of California. ; .
Messrs. Wilson & Wilson thereupon filed
the authenticated copy, of the alleged will and
the probate thereof together with a petition
for the probate of the", copy in California /as a
foreign will and for the Issuance to the de
fendant of letters testamentary, which peti
tion was signed by James Dunsmulr as peti
tioner and by Wilson & Wilson as attorneys
for the petitioner. This was on the 26th of
April. 1900.
IXCOMFETENCY IS ALLEGED.
Alexander Dunsmuir at the time of his
death and at the time of making the alleged
will was a resident of California and domiciled
therein. At the time of the filing of the copies
Josephine Dunsmuir was in the City -of New
York. While there she was visited by Rus
sell Wilson, one of the firm of Wilson . &
Wilson, with whom she consulted' as to her
rights to the estate \u25a0 of; Alexander Dunsmuir.
She was advised by Russell Wilson to apply for
a revocation of the probate of the 'alleged will
on the ground that It had not been duly, execut
ed and that the decedent, was incompetent to
execute a will and that the will had been ob
tained .from him by undue influence exercised
by James Dunsmuir. Josephine Dunsmuir
thereupon directed Russell Wilson that it was
her intention to so apply for. such revocation
of the Drobate of the alleged will.
Immediately subsequent to the Interview,
Russell Wilson left \u25a0 New \u25a0 York for Europe and
Josephine I Dunsmuir came .West* to San | Fran
cisco . for ' the purpose of applying for the pro
posed revocation. On her arrival in this city
she Interviewed Mountford Wilson. > a member
of the firm of Wilson & Wilson, then acting
for the defendant, ' James Dunsmuir, as'hls at
torneys. She was advised by him that she
should apply for the revocation.
Thereafter the defendant,- James Dunsmuir,
conspired with Mountford Wilson and the lat
ter, acting on his suggestion, ad\ised and false
ly' and fraudulently represented to" Josephine
Dunsmulr that she should not apply ; for ; the
revocation of the probate. of the will ny\ reason
of the facts stated to her by Mountford Wilsonâ
that if the probate was set aside and -the will
declared void on the ground of.- Incompetence of
the testator the marriage of the testator. with
Josephine \u25a0 Dunsmuir, i solemnized on the same
day thatthe will was executed, would also be
declared Invalid and void on the same ground.
WILSON IS ACCUSED. ' :
Acting upon the advice and â¢ representation
of Â« Mountford Wilson, Josephine Dunsmnlr did
not take proceedings to have the probate of
the will revoked. â¢ After * the \u25a0 probate of the
alleged will In this State. the defendant. James
Dunsmulr." In order to ward j off any ; suspicion
that Josephine Dunsmulr might entertain,'; em
ployed the firm of Wilson & Wilson to act as
his" attorneys but -unknown to Josephine .Duns
mulr.They were retained to obtain; a release of
the claims, of Josephine Dunsmulr against . the
estate and pretended to enter' lnto : an :agree

consideration -of the sum of $25,000 per annum,
to be paid to her > by '"James* Dunsmulr; during
her life, purported ; to waive gas heir ! at* law

PARTY LEADERS
ARE IN DOUBT
It will be six- months before the Demo
cratic and Republican parties really know
whether or not they are entitled to have
a place on the ballot" at' the next muni
cipal election. â¢ Of course there is little
doubt^ that both' of these parties received
the necessary 3 per cent of the votes cast,
and will be seen on the , next "official bal
lot, i but such might; not be the; Â«ase.. ( "The
fact 'that the Republican ticket icame
first on J the \ voting machine, : and that \\s
candidates were the same as those on the
Democratic ticket, which appeared Just
below,' may have caused. the Democratic
voters to have carelessly neglected their
own^ ticket and to. have turned the top
lever. In this! way the Democratic party
may j have failed to secure the necessary
3 per , cent. If such should be the case
the Democrats would be forced to peti
tion for a place on the ballot.
Because, of the negligence of the elec
tion clerks no tab was kept. of.the;sep
arate votes of the two parties. ;As the
figures of the two tickets were called ' Off
they were added .together and \ the total
vote- alone put down on the tally sheet.
Even at the official count, which -begins
next it Twill be Impossible to
\u25a0 get these figures. ' ' . .
The two parties will have to wait until
â¢the election : % machines are^'opened, before
they can determine their stfengthas polled
at" this 'election. -' Part of the machines
will be opened at the Registrar's office
and part will be. opened at the warehouse.
Meantime, the, leaders of the parties will
be kept in suspense. ". ' s v

GOSSIP ABOUT
APPOINTMENTS
There was a well-defined rumor around
the City Hall yesterday that P. H. Mc-
Carthy will succeed Alexander O'Grady
as Police Commissioner in the event of
O'Grady receiving the appointment of
chief assistant 'under City Attorney-elect
Burke. O'Grady Is associated with Burke
In the law' business and the position,
which pays $300 per month, may be his
for' the asking. " - ";
, i lf McCarthy is not made. Police Com
missioner by Mayor Schmitz the gossips
say he will receive a fat billet In the De
partment of .Public . Works, j The position
of - Superintendent â¢of Construction of
Buildings under the bond issue may be
created for McCarthy at a- munificent
salary. . , - â¢ .
Dr. George \ Drucker, who championed
Mayor Schmitz's cause on the Lillenfeld
Grund Jury, is likely to be aip...nted on
some commission, If a vacancy 'occurs in
the event of.' shift in positions. Drucker
was lan â¢ aspirant for, a vacancy on the
Police Commission a â¢ year, ago, ' but . had
to give way .to ' O'Grady.
The rumor Is current that Police Com
missioner. Thomas Reagan is not in favor
with, the Schmitz administration, but his
term does not. expire until January 8.
1907. It is riot likely that he will be dis
turoeU, and Drucker may have to wait
t a;year-for the vacancy. to. occur.
\u25a0 The .wl.seafcresj are expressing doubts jas
to whether Fire Commissioner- -John* S. 1
Parry will be reappolnted when his term
expires next January. Parry's friends
scout tne proposition ' that he will not
succeed himself, and point to the fact that
he was very active in the support of
Schmitz in the recent campaign..
There is reason to believe that John
Ryan, the veteran clerk of. the Board of
Supervisors, will* be retained In his. posi
tion, and that Cyril Williams, expert to

the new Board of Supervisors.
