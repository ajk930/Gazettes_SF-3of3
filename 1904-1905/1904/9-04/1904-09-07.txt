On Van' Ness avenue, from Market
to Washington street,: had gathered
the largest crowd ever : assembled on
that thoroughfare to witness a parade.
The sight -was one to ; be remembered.
On both;sldesof the '- street; reviewing
stands had been erected at
of about- two :, blocks and "these were
filled to : their utmost capacity with
women; and children and" a" sprinkling
of men. â¢ At one stand the -predom-;

the most . imposing display of ,â¢ the \ pa
rade; Companies A and B 'of the<com

lutions during the march apd were
heartily applauded. .. . . .
Twelve divisions followed the police
lead. The procession was two hours
and fifty-five minutes passing a' given
point arid the estimated number, of
men in line, including the musicians
and drum 'corps, was (8000,- a much
larger number than paraded in 1883,
when the last conclave was â¢ held in
this city. Even the. sweetest and the
best music was marred because of the
short distance between bands. When
passing the " reviewing ; stand every
band struck .up a- popular march and
there was- not ; a- moment Â¦ in three
hours when I there", was not the "sound
of martial harmony to cheer the
sweltering masses" In the grandstands
and on" the streets.

The sun rose. In a partly clear sky,
amid promises of a glorious day for the
parade. The weather prophet kept
good his word for "fair and -warm," and
before 9 o'clock the straggling bank of
fog that hovered over Twin Peaks with
the persistency of a Japanese flanking
movement commenced to divide on the
spur of the hills into thin ribbons of
mist that strayed baywards and finally
melted In *the warm rays of the sun.
By this time the several divisions were
forming on Post street, Geary, O'Far
rell. Eddy, Powell, Stockton and many
of the streets south of Market. Emi
nent Sir C. L. Field of the California
Commandery was grand captain gen
eral and he handled the big procession
with marvelous skill, assisted, by the
Police Department," whose work was up
to its usual standard in such matters.
The Eastern visitors were loud in their
praise of the efforts of the police to
make as perfect as possible all arrange,
ments for the parade.
PARADE STARTS.
But this is neither, here nor there.
The arduous march to Antioch and the
successful issue of the campaign gave
way to the words of historic value that
shall tell of Â¦ the bold tramp from
Geary and Market streets to, Van Ness
avenue and return. The -bold dashes
of Simon de Montfort were as. naught
compared with the recklesf charges on
the water-wagons. The heat came out
of the sky and the ground in relays
and was sharper than any Damascus
blade and more enervating than a
Turkish bath. - . ;
Knight Templarism brought with it
to San Francisco and California all
that is worthy of emulation in the an
cient and much that is to be admired
in the modern. â¢ The sturdy marching
men represented the traditions of ten
centuries ago and the more unromantic
conditions . of . our more prosaic and
more businesslike period. Some said
that the 8000 men'in line could jointly
insure the payment of the national
debt. Others said that rich as- is the
order of the Templar, there are â¢ those
among them whose walks are among
the humble, and that wealth alone was
not the most striking feature of the
units that went to make up the .great
procession of Masonic 'mankind.
RECKLESS CHARGES.
Could the founder of the ", Knights
Templar have risen from his grave yes
terday and scanned the ranks" of ! the
followers of. his order he would perhaps
have had renewed faith in the hordes
that defended the pilgrims and re
marked -that after all "valor is only a
part of pomp. Pomp ruled the "day in
the twentieth century as force govern
ed the steeled Knights 'of the year 1000,
when the mixed 'forces ,of the Crusa r
ders met to. plan the first siege. Yes
terday, in modern San Francisco, the
uniformed legions of the Templar
showed even more military skill, more
unity of purpose, than did the scat
tered, disorganized enthusiasts who
rallied .about the. cross to. threaten the
lines of the Saracens. .

HOLDS FIRST RECEPTION
After enjoying an inlprmal luncheon
thesA high Masonic dignitaries 'went
into executive session Â«tn<L inaugurated
tiÂ«- ousiness of the conclave. To-day,
to-morrow an<l Friday they will again
gather at Golden Gate Hall to discuss
and settl* questions relating \o toe
conduct- of . the order. The duty of
raising Right Eminent Sir George M.
Moulton. present deputy grand master,
to the high office of grand master of
the order in th<Â» United States will also
devolve upon the Grand Encampment
before it adjourns.
The social side of the conclave was
rot forgfttten yesterday, notwithstand
ing the jrrcat attraction of parade and
<Srand Encampment. The mÂ«-st notable
social feature was the reception given
last evening at the Palace Hotel to
Grand Master Stoddard. though much
interest attached to the reception of
the Earl of Euston by California Com
m2ndery at Mechanics'- Pavilion. The
great nave of the ferry building was
also the scene of a pleasant function,
the first of a series of promenade con
certs befrsg given there" last" evening.
FEATURE OF PROGRAMME.
The feature of to-day's programme
le the competitive drill anj presenta
tion of prizes at the Golden Gate Park
baseball â¢ grounds. From the . heights
surrounding the grounds 40,000 people
rr;ay witness the contest, which prom
ises to be thc-mest-picturesque event of
the conclave. Excursions to nearby
cities and resorts will- be on to-day and
doubtless will be taken advantage of
by m?.ny thousands of the strangers
now gathered here.
A banquet to the Grand Encampment
of the United Suites and representa
tives from Great Britain at the St.
Francis and a reception in their honor
to be. tendered by the Grand Command
ery of Ohio ct the Maple room of the
Palace .will be the most striking of to
day's features. Those not attending
these functions will not be given a
chance to rest, however, for no less
than twenty similar affairs, under the
direction of the- various commanderies,
are scheduled. The grand ball at Me
chsnics' FavilJon under the auspices
of .California Commandery will > be a
fplendid climax to the pleasures of the
day. In point of numbers and beauty
cf attire it will be unusual.
BUSINESS INAUGURATED.
The great parade was the feature of
Â¦yesterday morning's programme, but
the afternoon was marked by an event
of even greater interest to the order â
the opening of the triennial session of
the Â«Jrar.d Encampment. The grand
officers of the order, delegates ac
credited to the encampment and the
delegation representing the Great
Priory of England and Wales and thÂ«Â»
British criÂ»n dependencies assembled
early Â«n the alternoon at Golden Gate
Hall. â¢- - -
History was made for San Francisco
yesterday and pleasant memories were
established fcr her chlvalrlc guests.
The citizens of this metropolis of the
great West have witnessed many bril
liant pageants within the last few years.
Armies have been mobilized within the
city's gates and sent away to war, and
veterans that were her guest" have
caught the cadence of marches of the
Ions a?o, but none presented more
martial dignity than the legions that
swung yesterday through the city's
streets,
The fourth grand division fonnedl
on Taylor, street, north of Geary. It
was headed by the Right Eminent Sir
Thomas Kite, grand commander. He
was â¢ mounted on a fine black horse,
and beside him rode Eminent Sir John
Nelson Bell, chief of staff. Behind
them rode aids on black horses.
At the head of the Cincinnati Com
mandery was borne the first American
flag ever used in a Templar parade.
It was first floated in 1872 at the con
clave held in Washington. D. C. The,
venerable ensign was held aloft by the
grand standard bearer of the com
mandery. The Sir Knight over whom
its silken folds floated at the long past
conclave has passed away. Yester
day when the flag, a little faded, flut
tered at the head of the Cincinnati
Commandery the fraters recalled in
cidents of the other conclave when
the banner was t new and bright. At
that time it was carried by Sir Knight
A. Wilson, who has since died.
Headed by George Blake's band, the
L'ouisville Commandery marched over
a hundred strong. Sir Knights, clad
In the regalia of another ; order of
Masonry,' held on high their standard.
In gold letters on the silk was In
scribed the Â«iotto. "Be thou faithful
unto death and . I will give thee a
crown ; of life." Â¦

followed by the Binghamton Comman
dery band, was next in line. Then
came commanderies of Virginia and
Vermont. The Grand Commandery of
New Hampshire with band and the
Washington Commandery No. 1 of
Hartford, Conn., In black and white
uniforms, followed. Bringing up the
rear of the division came the New
Haven Commandery, whose members
furnished considerable merriment along
the route. During a halt on Van Nes3
avenue several of the Knights sang
choruses and others capered to the
music of the approaching bands, to the
great amusement and applause of
thousands. *
Interspersed with bands every two
blocks, many of them being comman
dery bands from visiting States, the
second division began with the Grand
Commandery of Massachusetts and
was followed by the De Molay Com
mandery of Boston. Boston Comman
dery No.. 2 disputed the right of line
and upon being refused marched to its
headquarters at the St. Francis and
disbanded. In this division the first
of the water wagons of the medical
corps made its appearance and at the
end of the division came two am
bulances. Others in line in this divi
sion were the Cavalry Commandery of
Providence. R. I., and Malta Comman
dery of t New Bedford, Mass. The next
to appear was the strikingly uniformed
commandery of Hugh de Payens of

gold and black and bore black tabards
with the skull and crossbones in gold.
Then followed the South Boston Com
mandery, Trinity Commandery of Hud

No. 1, on black horses and divided
into fourteen troops. Black and silver
trappings flashing in the sunlight and
marking the head of the parade as far
as the eye could see.
The infantry of the Golden Gate
Commandery No. 16 was in the center
of the first division and its course
was marked along the route with dif
ficult and clean-cut evolutions in the
various crosses of the order. The cav
alry of the California Commandery
No. 1 also. > performed clever fancy
-figures, the - horses hjk! ! -: men falling
into their places without a break.
- .Carriages carrying the Grand Com
manderies -of New York and Indiana

poured in and out of the hall during
the evening.
Among the guests of the command
ery was Sir Knight S. M. Bushman of
Gettysburg, Pa. He "presented the

unique* souvenir, "a gavel made from
a tree that grew on the battlefield of
Gettysburg. Imbedded in the head of
the gavells a bullet flred during the

Handsome women, richly gowned, at
tended by Sir Knights in full regalia,
who thronged the lobbies and mezza

by a concert by the Louisville Com

As the interesting affair progressed
bodies of white plumed Sir Knights, ac
companied by their ladies, marched into
the hotel with their bands of music,
which enlivened the scene by serenad
ing the hosts of the evening and finally
joining with the visiting commander
ies in partaking of the refreshments
furnished by the Kentuckians in their

'The Emergency Hospital established

pital is an example of* the foresight
shown . by the guiding spirits of the
conclave.
Shortly after the report was received
at the Emergency Hospital of Mr.
Leath's death a call was Bent in from
Market and Eighth streets. MIes Mar-
Sir Knight Lcath was a native of
Knoxvillo. Tenn., aged 60 years, and
wag one of the most enthusiastic of the
members of his commandery. He had
looked forward with interest to the
parade and had made the boast that he
had attendid nearly all of them that
had occurred since that of 1S83 in San
Franfrisco. The startling death of Mr.
L^ath caused considerable consterna
tion in the ranks of the marching
Knights and the procession was halted
several minutes in consequence of the
confusion that resulted. *
CONSTERNATION J.V RANKS.
An ambulance' in charge of Dr S M
Mouser was near by and the body was
quickly placed therein and driven to
the Morgue, where Deputy CoronerMc4
Cormick gave permission to have It re4
moved to an undertaking parlor. *
The death of Sir Knight Joseph Leath
was a cad blow to the members of
Coeur de Lion Commanflery and has
cast a shadow over the gtherw ise pleas
ant visit of the Tennessee order. Mr.
Leath was riding, in a carriage at the
head of his commandery and when it
reached the corner of California street
and Van Ness avenue he stepped out of
the vehicle to make place for an aged
Sir Knight who had become 'exhausted
from the long walk. Joining his com
mandery ranks Mr. Leath walked about
fifteen paces. when he suddenly sank to
the street, throwing his hand over his
heart with a groan. In a few seconds
he was a corpse.
Surgeon George H. Boskowitz treated
the patient for a contused and lacer
ated injury of the head. Later Mr.
Kiminon* was removed to the Waldeck
Sanatorium, where a consultation was
held as to the advisability of perform
ing an operation to determine the ex
tent of the sufferer's injuries. Shortly
after 10 o'clock the patient grew
stronger and it was determined to per
mit him to rest, the supposition being
that the fracture, if such exists, is
not bo serious as was at first suppoed.
He showed a tendency to recover. At
midnight he was resting comparatively
easy with a good chance of recovery.
Mr. Siminoff took a great interest in
the Masonic Home at Decoto and from
the time the cornerstone was laid up
to the present he was ready to help
it with suggestions and money. Shortly
after the home had been opened he be
came interested in the Boys' Band and
he presented each member a uniform.
Subsequently he decided to donate to
the home a brick cottage so that there
miffht be added comfort for the in
mates. After a eite in proximity
to the home had leen selected he let a
contract for the building of the cottage
at a cost of nearly 520,000 and when it
waÂ» completed he presented it to the
board of trustees of the home in per
petuity for the Masonic fraternity and
the gift wag accepted on behalf of
Grand Lodge of California by Grand
Master Orrin L. Henderson.
One fatality, a serious accident that
may end in death and a number of
prostrations from h^at and overexertion
i5 the aftermath of the great Knights
Templar parade. Sir Knight Joseph
Lcath of Coeur de Lion Commandery.
Knoxville. Tenn., is dead and Sir
Knight Morris Siminoff, a well-known
merchant of this city, is lying at the
point of death at the Waldeck Sana
torium as a result of being thrown
from his horse at Ninth and Market
streets prior to the forming of the
parade yesterday morning.
At the City Emergency Hospital
et-ven erases of a minor character were
irtttted and as many more were re
ported to the police and hospital at
tendants that were not of sufficient im
portance to call for treatment.
The accident to Mr. Siminoff was a
strange one. He had left his home at
672 Fulton street to join his command
cry and before riding away from the
front of his Hat experienced some diffi
culty with his horse. On arriving at
Jcnc-s and Market streets the animal
took fright and bolted at the shouts
of a crowd of men and boys and the
noise of an approaching band. At
Ninth and Market streets the horse
turned suddenly to one side and threw
its rider, who fell on his head on the
afphalt pavement, remaining tmcon-
Bclous until removed to the Central
Emergency Hospital, where for a mo
ment he gave signs of reviving, but im
mediately lapsed into a comatose con
dition, failing to show any evidence of
regaining his senses until late last
night.

Boston Commandery. has the oldest charter
of any commandery present .and as such Is
entitled to the right of the line of the second
division and by - parade order â¢ No; 1, Issued
over the signature of the Grand Commander
of Massachusetts and Rhode Island before
leaving Boston, was assigned to that position.
On the evening before the parade a new order
was â¢ received from the Grand Commander of
Massachusetts and Rhode Island rescinding
the former order. â¢ This order was so â¢ In
definite that we were unable to determine our
position In the parade. On arriving at thÂ«
place of formation It was discovered that the
commandery escorting the Grand Commandery
of Â¦ Massachusetts and Rhode Island to its
place In line had been assigned by the Grand
Commander of Massachusetts and Rhode Isl
and to a position on the right of Boston Com
mandery. Â¦ .
Considering this i an injustice and in direct
opposition to the general orders as quoted and
also to those Issued by. the Grand Commander
of Massachusetts and" Rhode Island before
leaving Boston, . our - commandery declined to
parade and returned to its quarters at the
St. Francis Hotel.
; The noticeable absence of Boston
Commandery from -the parade caused
considerable comment and no small
amount: of chagrin to the many ad
mirers- of the organization, who had
awaited impatiently along the line or
march for ..an opportunity Â¦ to greet
the oldest and for many years the
largest' commandery in the United
States. .The failure of the command*
ery^tp appear in the interesting / pa
geant was due to the order of. parade,
which placed the commandery in . an
objectionable position. At an early
hour the Vcommandery reported to its
division commander, where . It was
learned that De Molay Commandery
had been given the place of honor in
the Massachusetts section, a posi
tion which, by reason . of Â¦ its seniority,
Boston Commandery claimed for , it
self.- In fact, it had previously been
assured the place/but the orders for
formation had been changed later,
by the '.Grand Commandery y .of
Massachusetts. When the Boston
Commandery " reached its position
in. the line -and \ learned .that, it
was to have a place- other than the
one it had been promised, its com
mander ordered the Knights back to
the St. Francis Hotel, where a meet
ing was held and the members of the
commandery unanimously indorsed
the stand taken by their leader. In
discussing the . matter ' later in the
Qay Commander Rinaldo Richardson
said:
Â¦ Boston Commandery declined to parade : to
day for the following: reasons:
â¢ Article 4 of parade . orders No. 4. Issued by
the commander of the parade under date of
July 20, 1004, reads as follows: .
"Commanderies, grand and subordinate,
will be formed. In 'grand divisions according

OF THE WORLD.
If there is any truth in this world
it finds its purest expression in the
relations that exist' between brother
Masons. m â¢
When a Mason in distress seeks a
brother Mason for his confidence and
advice that moment the prejudices
and ethics of the professional and
commercial worlds are blotted out
and truth comes as near being crys-
tallized into substance as human re-
lations permit.
- Now to the point. There are tens
of thousands of Masons in the United
States, and the homes of many are
clouded by the presence of Bright's
disease and diabetes.
We make to you the solemn, an-
nouncement that the cure for these
hitherto fatal diseases has positively
been discovered in this city. And
we come to you with the proof tha*
you yourselves would ask. Tbt ' re-
coveries in this- city run into 'hun-
dreds and record the names of three
thirty-third degree Masons, one of
whom recovered himself, and two
others had members of their own
families saved, and this, too, after
medical science had seemingly* been
exhausted.
It is Masonic to do good. You
know some to whoA this informa-
tion would be literally a Godsend.
In their interest, in the interest of
suffering thousands all over the Unit-
ed States, in the interest of humanity,
we are permitted to give you the.
names of these of your^ brethren into
whose homes happiness* has been car-
ried by the restoration of loved ones
when all hope was gone, and who,
knowing the truth, will tell you.
Â¦ know how to approach each

Vatican Authorities Consider This an
Answer to Premier Combes'
Speech.
ROME. Sept. 6. â In a private audi
ence with the Pope to-day Mgr. Le
Nordze resigned the bishopric of Di
jon. The Vatican authorities consider
this an answer to the speech pf Pre
mier Coombes at Auxerre on Sunday
last.
The resignation of Bishop Le Nordze
and of Mgr. Geay demonstrate, as far
as the Vatican authorities are con
cerned, that all the clergy of France,
even the members who have hereto
fore been considered as wavering, side
with the Pope in the present conflict.
It was the summoning to Rome' of
the Bishop of Dijon and the Bishop of
Laval 'by the Vatican for trial, without
consulting the French Government,
which led to the rupture of relations
between France and the Vatican.

VOTING ON QUESTION"
OF ENDING THE STRIKE
As to Miss St. Julian's antecedents
the police know nothing, but here she
has been leading a. dual life. Others
may be implicated in the theft, but
with the recovery of the ~oods the case
will be dropped.
The detectives found Miss St. Julian,
alias Mrs. Smith, conducting a mani
curing establishment at Hotel Nor
mandip and Pearl Morton identified her
as her former seamstress who had sold
her the goods. When Miss St. Julian
was taken into custody she did not
weep or become hysterical, but instead
put on a bold front, threatening civil
suits for damages. She was finally in
duced to remember that she had sold
certain valuables to the Morton
woman, but asserted that she had pur
chased them from a negress whose
name she rould not remember. She
finally admitted having sold other por
tions of the Vanderleck property at
other housr* of doubtful character and
from such places the police have re
covered practically all of the stolen
property.
Late Sunday night Pearl Morton, a
woman of the half world, telephoned
to detectives that she thought she had
a oortion of Mrs. Vanderleck's goods.
Fhe stated that she had purchased
them some time ago from a woman
who called herself "Mrs. Stella Smith,"
end who had been employed by her
as a seamstress. She did not know
v here this woman was. but she was
billing to surrender the goods if they
Â« ould be identified, -tie showed the
<1rtectives among other things two ex
au-isite lace fans carved in mother of
fiiarl wortli $250, an elaborately flow
cied ?i!k shawl of Oriental workman
ship worth $300, a Mexican rebosa
valued at $150 and a number of very
rar* and expensive lace handkerchiefs.
Mrs. Vandorleck identified the prop
erty.
In the female ward of the City Jail
is pretty Miss Josephine St. Julian, a
striking: brunette, well educated, much
traveled and seemingly a cultured
woman. If she did not steal the
treasures she knows who did, for she
told them, and because of the sales she
was taken into custody. She will not
be prosecuted, however, for if the case
reached the coerts it trotil-i be certain
to be productive of an ugly scandal
v hich might involve other persons.
In order to prevent such a scandal
end at the request of the owner of the
stolen property, the Police Department
has made every effort to keep secret
the fact of the arrest and the recovery
<'f the goods. They have even denied
that such an arrest had been made,
but finally admitted it.
To-morrow Miss St. Julian will be
taken quietly to a depot, her ticket
purchased and she will be sent to some
destination which will not be made
Xiublic.
More than six months ago Mrs. Van
dericck, before going out of the city
fur half a year, leased her fine home
furnished to Mrs. C. A. Toy, a wealthy
lady who had recently come from Chi
ta po. With Mrs. Toy, in the capacity
of governess to her two children, came
Miss St. Julian. In a garret of the
house which had been reserved for
pturape purposes, Mrs. Vanderleck
placed two large trunks containing the
valuable heirlooms. She again took
possession of her house June 1, but for
nearly three months thereafter she did
not have occasion to examine the
trunks. Then she discovered that her
priceless valuables had been stolen and
th^ theft was immediately reported to
the detectives.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 6.â The mys
tery surrounding the theft from the
palatial home of Mrs. Henry Vander
leck. a few days ago. of family heir
looms valued at many thousands of
dollars, which had descended to her
from ancestors who were among the
most prominent Spanish families in the
State before American occupation, has

BUENOS ATRES, Argentina. Sept.
6.â Two thousand men were killed and
four thousand - wounded In a battle
lasting three days between the Uru
guayan Government, forces and the
revolutionists. General Vasquez. the
Minister of War, who led the Govern
ment troops, was defeated and he has
retreated, abandoning his arms and
munitions.
While General Vazquez recently re
ported to the Government that he had
won an important victory over the rev
olutionists, it seems from later news
received from the field that his own
forces were routed.
- In the recent battle the revolutionists
were driven back and General Vazauez.
while pressing his victory, was sudden
ly, met with stubborn resistance. The
rebels reassembled their scattered
forces and engaged the Government
troops. For three days the battle
raged, with terrible losses on both
sides. Gradually the rebels drove Vaz
quez back. According to the last re
ports the Minister of War was in full
retreat.

Dr. Wheeler nere, It you could convince the
Board of Regents that you could 'do the work
better than he does. But I doubt If you could
get the doctor out. I
Next to industry is self-reliance. In this
quality most of us are weak. By self-reliance
I don't mean self-conceit. There Is a story of
I a boy I used to read that Illustrates my point.
1 The boy was crossing a swollen stream on a
horse and he thought he was about to drown.
When he cried out to his father on the oppo
site bank . that he. would drown the parent
yell: "No; you're not going to drown; if you
do I'll lick you within an Inch of your life."
If you would succeed in the world you must
rely on your self-reliance..
. I grant you that the competition is keener
than it used to be. j I won't say that the tar
get is any smaller, but ; the bullseye Is. But
the target is still big enough for you to hit it
and you can do it If you make-up your mind.
You must have aim for your .. goal, a high
standard of excellence. -The standard of excel
lence in Iowa was established â¢ In : horse Â¦, racing
a long time ago. It began with a race on the
prairie between two farmers' horses. Now,
the order cf things has been' changed and the
results are better. The owner, of Axtel knew
that Â¦â¢ the grtat horse had a > noble ancestry â
you want to be 'careful about -that â but the
horse did not do his best until his owner tried
out three or four trainers, and .then tried the
whip himself- It needed only theowner's whip
to stir the blood in the great animal to make
him famous. ... : : -'

It is set forth that the . trustee* v are

that Donahoe was a soldier and
Lemon the commander of his regi
ment. Donahoe was addicted" t6 the
use of intoxicating liquors, and for
fear that he would lose or improperly
spend .his savings he turned over $4 60

OAKLAND, Sept. 6. â The death of
Arthur, Skipper, the 19-year-old son
of Captain J. J. Skipper, master of
the schooner Valentia, was due to his
drinking of carbolic acid, according to
an autopsy held to-day at the Morgue.
Saturday young Skipper was found
dead in a chair at his home, 911 Sixty
third street. It was at first supposed
that nicotine poisoning caused the
young man's death, as he was an in
voterate cigarette smoker. "At the in
quest to-night Mrs. A. Stohl, Skip
per's aunt, who found the body, tes-.
tined she could give no reason why
her nephew should commit suicide.

Arrangements Are Under Way for a
Delightful Outing at Camp
Taflor.
General MacArthur suggests -that
legislative authority be obtained to
classify as mounted officers all captains
of infantry and artillery not now in
the' mounted category. He says that
the exigencies of modern field work re
quire so much from a captain of In
fantry that he cannot possibly dis
charge his duties if he has to drag bis
body through the exhausting efforts of
a long march, as after such a strain
he is physically incapacitated for super
vising the attack' formations In ex
tended order for a service company of
.100 or more. Therefore, precisely at a
moment when his professional skill is
most needed he Is least effective.
This arrangement would mean a total
Increase In' pay for the 520 officers af
fected of about $38,000.
General MacArthur says that "great
success attended the joint camp maneu
vers and field instruction instituted â¢ in
thÂ» Department of the Columbia during
the month of July." j >' *
> He closes his report by saying that
It is pleasant to report a considerable
decrease in the number of desertiong
during the year just closed as com
pared with the preceding year.
General MacArthur says the concen
tration of political and economical In
terests in the Pacific Ocean has enor
mously increased the military import
ance of that side of the continent and
the continued rapid progress of events
suggests the expediency of an early en
largement of military facilities to meet
the growing necessities of the Pacific
Coast. He recommends that a new post
for a full regiment of infantry be es
tablished in the vicinity of Los Angeles
and a post for a full regiment of cav
alry at a suitable site in the Willamette
Valley, in Oregon. This last recom
mendation Is made with a view to a
full regiment of cavalry being divided
between the Presidio and Ord barracks
and another regiment, of cavalry at the
post above mentioned, raakintr two. full
cavalry regiments for the Pacific Coast.
WASHINGTON, Sept. Â«.â In addition

If you can set your mind working and. keep

I want to congratulate you who are getting
this education. But you must remember, that
the university is not everything. And right
here I want to say there is one difficulty with
our schoolsâ they give" too much Information
and not enough education. . I mean by 1 that that
there is too much pouring In and not enough
drawing out. What Is needed more is mental
development â the ability to think and deduct.
' i don't know whether it was Jeffries or Fltz
slrr.mons â you : gentlemen know more about
that than I doâ but one of them could bit bo
hard that he could puncture a punching bag.
Now, that was education. And if you would
â¢ticceed you. must educate your muscles â the
muscles of your brain, so to speak.
I always like to tell that story about Grant'a
education. Grant, you Â£now, although an ed
ucated man, graduated at the foot of his class.
That indicates that /the educated Than, is not'
necessarily one of attainments. I would Just
as soon trust the man at) the foot, providing
he has worked fcr what little success has
come to him, as the man at the top. The
man who works hard finally succeeds. ' The
smart fellcw is too apt to stop when he has
solved one problem. . . .
" "Being a Cabinet officer Is a mighty
important job," said Secretary Shaw,
"but it is not so important from close
by." v
â¢ Then he went on to say that there Is
nothing in this life that has so much
charm about It as student life. There
are charms, of course, in the other
phenomena of nature, there is charm in
the growing of a babe and charm in
the aging of the old, but there is a
different kind of charm about student
life. There is something inspiring
about young men and women Iltting
themselves in one great community
for the struggle with the world.
- A commotion in the rear of the gym
nasium disturbed the Secretary and he
paused long enough to loose another
of his witticisms. He said he wanccd
everybody to be seated because he'd
rather see 100 young people come . in
than see fifty go out.
"I used to teach a school myself,"
he said, "but never an institution like
this.. I think I'd rather be at fhe head
of a great university like this than
anything else in the world. And that
follows along the, line that I have al
ready pointed outâ that there Is a cer
tain charm about student life that is
indescribable. Under it you see young
men and women, as I said before, get
ting ready to meet *he 'world. Some
of you may go out and be failures and
some be successes. . But I -must say
this, that it will not be for lack of
knowledge, for^ you get all you want
here, but for the knowing or not know
ing how. He further said: â¢ â¢â¢â¢
BERKELEY, Sept. 6.â Leslie .M.
Shaw, Secretary of the Treasury,
knows how to tell a story. The Secre
tary's stories are all good stories and
there are many of them. But he does
not debase them to the mere story
teller's subterfuge .to raise a laugh.
His design is to illustrate the sterner
side of life and bring the point home
to his auditors. This predilection for
the story as a vehicle for illustration
the Secretary generously indulged
when he a'ddressed the student body
of the University of California this
afternoon in Harmon Gymnasium.
That he carried humor as well as con
viction was evident from the number
of times he paused, to let the applause
and laughter die out.
The very first word Secretary Shaw
said was the beginning of a story. It
concerned his /official capacity as a
Cabinet' officer* only it was on 'Grant's
Attorney-General. When the Secretary
visited his native town he tried to get
the sentiment of his old neighbors upon
his rise to statesmanship, but his fame
was of little consequence to the neigh
bors.- When he asked one of them how
they took his promotion to the exalted
office the lout replied: .
"Oh, they only laughed." ,.

The skipper of the Vauban called
upon the police to arrest the boys, re
lying upon the existing treaty between
France and the United States touching
detention of runaway sailors. Police
man Fahy overhauled the trio, this
morning. The boys surrendered but
begged the patrolmen not to. compel
them to attack beans again. Trie Vau

George Davis, George â¢ Foster and
Thomas Williams were arrested last
night by Detective Bunner and placed
on the detinue book on suspicion that
they ' were pickpockets. They were
captured at the corner of Haight and
Stanyan streets. Davis was pointed
â¢Vmt to Bunner as a pickpocket from
Los Angeles by Detective Davis of the
same place. Thirty-five pickpocket re
ports were read off to the various
watches last night. The light-fingered
gentry have been reaping a rich har
vest by plying their trade among un
sophisticated visitors, but all save a
few have eluded capture by the police.
Plricidio G. Valencia was arrested
last night on Kearny street, near Mor

for grand larceny. Valencia was seen
to pick the pocket of H. J. Hurst of
1647 Mission street of a watch and
fob. Hurst felt in his pocket imme
diately after the touch and then '.-ailed
for the police. 'Valencia was pointed
out and locked up by Policeman Pat
O'Brien. Just before his arrest he
threw the watch on the sidewalk,
where it was afterward found.

Burglars cleaned out M. V. Costa's
Jewelry store at 960% East Fourteenth
street last night. They left nothing
of bis stock and fixtures except a few
tools and showcases. Costa furnished
the police with a long list of Jewelry
th?* comprised the 6tock that has dis
appeared. The thieves included a num
ber of watches that had been left with
the Jeweler to be repaired.
Costa locked up his place of busi
ness last evening as usual. When he
went to the place this morning he was
astonished to find the shop sw ept clean.
The Jeweler could hardly believe his
own eyes, but it did not require a sec
ond glance go disclose tbe bare shelves
and showcases. The police responded
to the alarm that Costa gave, but all
the detectives uncovered was the mark
ef a chisel in the front window sash
where the instrument had been useJ
to pry open an entrance Into the shop.
The stock was not a large one, but
the loss falls heavily on the jeweler,

Oakland Offioe San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Sept. 6.
By the recent election the city of
Oakland voted to raise $960,000 for
the purpose of building new schools
and generally improving the entire
school system.
In answer to question . four, will say that
the money should be deposited in tbe county
treasury.
In answer to question three, wilt say that
the County Tax Collector shall collect the
tax.
In answer to question two, will eay that the
bond tax Is to be computed by the County
Auditor.
The county officers must handle the
funds raised by the recent Oakland
bond election, according to a decision
handed down by District Attorney
Allen to-day in answer to a query from
County Auditor Bacon as to whether
he or the City Auditor must do the
work of computing the. tax. The elec
tion was held under what is known as
the district plan and in the present in
stance a small piece of territory outside
of the city limits was included for
bonding purposes and it thus throws
the work of handling the coin and dp
ing the work on the county officers,
while the City Board of Education
spends the money.
In his answer to the Auditor's letter
Allen says:
In answer to question one, will cay that
the money is to be deposited with the County
Treasurer to the credit of -the building fund
of the Oakland School District.

BERKELEY, Sept. 6.-Vrhe Anti-
Compulsory Vaccination League of
Berkeley wants to debate* the efficacy
of vaccination and its results before
the public and through its executive
committee a challenge has been issued
to the pro-vaccinationists to come out
and meet them on the rostrum. .The
challenge is issued to all doctors and
medical authorities of California,. who
are requested to select their ablest
representatives and to send them. into
debate against sp< akers representing
the league.
The anti-vacclnationlsts prefer to
discuss the question with Secretary
Foster of the State Board of Health,
Dr. aicCallum, Dr. George F. Rein
hardt or Dr. von Adelung of Oakland.
The question to be debated is, "Re
solved, That the compulsory vaccina
tion law is unjust and should not be
enforced, but should be repealed." The
challenge is signed by Dr. J. U.
Oberg, John A. Wilson and W. T.
Baxley of the executive committee of
the league.
Chief of Police John Conrad has filed
with the City Clerk an itemized esti
mate of the funds that he figures will
be required to conduct his department
another year. - He asks for a total of
$19,106, of -which sum $18,820 is for sal
aries. Chief Conrad requests that the
salaries of the thirteen patrolmen of
the force be raised from $80 to $90 a
month and the pay of the sergeant and
the detective be Increased from $90 to
$95.
I will take second place to no one In loyal
support of our public schools, but I am, con
vinced from Investigations that I have made
that a grtat saving could be made In the
School Deitartment and that without Injury/ to
our educational institutions. This year the
Board oÂ£ Education asks for $14,000 more than
last year and the school census report shows
that there are but three more children en
rolled. I do not think our teachers are being
paid toojnuch, but I do -believe too many sal
aries are paid. â¢ Â¦ ,
. In AUmeda I find that the average number
of pupils taught by one teacher is 32. while in
San Francisco the class runs from 50 to 60 to
the instructor. I consider that 45 pXipils can
be well handled by one teacher.
BERKELEY, Sept. 6.â The Board of
Education must make the financial
ends of the School Department meet
again this year with a 25-cent appor
tionment. "; There is a good deal of dis
satisfaction with the Board of Trus
tees' action last night In fixing the rate
at this figure, but It is too late now to
help it. Last year the rate was lowered
from 30 to 25 cents and this aroused the
School Directors almost to mandamus
proceedings. This year the Directors
hoped for something better, but they
are disappointed again. The Trustees
take the view that the other depart
ments y must not suffer for the schools
and that the only way the people -will
be made to see the folly of a tax rate
limited to 75 cents is through the non
advancement of the schools. The Trus
tees are also aware that there will be a
bond election before the year is out, so
that there may be no need for a 30
cent apportionment. Of the 25 cents,
16 cents will go to- the High School
and 9 cents to the grammar schools.
The apportionment to the library
fund is increased from 8 to 10 cents in
anticipation of the additional cost that
the removal to the Carnegie Library
will entail. The apportionments to the
other funds are as follows: General, 32
cents; street, 18 cents: sewer bond, 3
cents; school bond, 1892, 4 cents; elec
tric light bond, 3 cents; school bond,
1900, 4 cents. The total rate is $1â75
cents for the support of the schools and
city and 25 cents for bond redemption.
ALAMEDA. Sept. 6.â The Alameda
Board of Education will ask the City
Trustees to appropriate $26,000 for the
public schools tms year. / Dr. Henry
M. Pond of the â¢ Trustees i has placed
himself on record as believing that the
Board. of Education is asking too much
of the taxpayers and that there are too
many salaries being paid. In explain
ing his attitude Dr. Pond said:
OMAHA. Neb., Sept. 6.â The Govern
ment is now being accused of "bunko"
work in connection with the recent
opening of the Rosebud Indian Reser
vation lands In South Dakota. A very
large number of those who drew prizes-
In the big lottery are greatly disap
pointed at what they got and have
gone with their complaints to the Gen
eral Land Office in "Washington.
The Government has always been
subjected to criticism at the conclusion
of these land lotteries, but In the pres
ent Instance the complaints seem to be
louder and more numerous than ever
before. Not half of the land, it is said
by those who drew it. is worth more
than the Government price and as a
result it Is estimated that not more
than one half of the 2431 winners in
the lottery will file upon thÂ© claims
they drew. Of the first 300â supposed
winners of $5000 fortunesâ ten per cent
dropped out, refusing to take the land
after looking it over.

WHITE. RIVER JUNCTION, VU
Sept. 6.â Vermont to-day elected a Gov
ernor and other State officers, two
members of Congress, thirty State Sen
ators and one* 'Representative from
each city and town. As was expected,
the Republicans were generally Jicto
rious, electing their entire ticket and
maintaining control of the Le^lature
by the usual large majority. The ciay
was flnÂ« and the vote was normal ror *
Presidential year.
The State officers elected are: Gov
ernor. Charles J. Bell, . Welden; Lieu
tenant Governor. Charles H. Stearns Â»
Treasurer, John L. Bacon; Secretary or
State. Frederick G. Fleetwood; Auditor
of Accounts, Horace A. Graham.
David J. Foster of Burlington was
elected to Congress from the First Dis
trict, and Klttredge Hasklns of Brat
tleboro from the Second District. The
complexion of the Legislature Is practi
cally unchanged. This indicates that
Senator Redneld Proctor will be re
elected. ,;Â¦-:
The campaign was hard fought by
both the leading parties, the Democrats
bending their efforts to a reduction of
the Republican majority of 31.000 &**Â£
to W. TV. Stickney for Governor in 1900.
Returns received at midnight indicate
that the Republicans elected the head
of their ticket by a plurality equal to,
if not greater than, that returned for
Stickney. a __ ...
The returns from 200 out of the 246
cities and towns of the State give Bell
(R.). 38.860; Porter (D.). 12,892. The
same places In 1900 gave Stickney (R.),
38.948; Senter (D.). 13.556.
These figures show a slight falling off
in the vote of both parties and indi
cate the election of Bell by about 32.000
plurality. Â¦
LITTLE, ROCK. Ark., Sept. 6.â Late
returns to-night from, the State election
yesterday show that while .the unop
posed Democratic nominees for State
offices received 85 per cent of the total
vote, the for Governor Davis

drop to 30,000^

Nothing was thought of the attach^
ment by the other nurses until Sun
day, when Humphries went to the hos
pital and left the place with Mrs. Car
ter. That was the last seen of them
and this evening word was received
that the couple were at Long Beach
and are to be married to-morrow.
Mrs. Carter's Darents live at Cuca
monga and they were unaware of the
affair until they heard of it through a
message from the couple. The board of
directors at the hosDital were much
perturbed over the matter, but Mrs.
Carter has arrived at more than the
age of discretion and nothing is to
be done in the matter save to send
congratulations.
SAN BERNARDINO, Sept. 6.â One of
the most sensational elopements on
record in this part of the State was
that of Roscoe Humphries, a local sta
bleman, with Mrs. M. E. Carter, which
tcok place Sunday and has just come
to light. Â«
For the past six years Mrs. Carter,
who Is 32 years of age, has been an in
mate of the County Hospital, a help
less invalid. Her sole means of moving
about was a creaky wheel chair. Some
two years ago Humphries was a nurse
at the hospital and there he fell vio
lently in love with the invalid, who is
a remarkably pretty woman in spite
of her infirmity. â¢
Though Kuropatkin's resource meets
with such praise; the. Dally Telegraph
"Kuropatkin has won the race," says
the Daily Telegraph, "and saved the
greater part of his army by one of
the most masterly retreats of military
history. Few things in the record of
war have been finer than the energy
and determination with which thfe
Czar's commander-in-chief prevented
the victors from converting a defeat
into a catastrophe, and the result will
have the most far-reaching influence
upon the whole future of the war. Com
bined with the stolid staying powers
of Ivan Ivanovitch, the tactics which
saved the situation after Liaoyang and
again at Yentai saved it once more
at the Hun River and protected the
crossing of the bulk of the forces."
At what cost this was accomplished
and whether the Japanese have been
"yet wholly thwarted of their prey."
the Daily Telegraph says will' not be
known for some days; but assuming
that Kuropatkin had 190,000 men at
Liaoyanpr. the paper says, he will be
comparatively fortunate if he leads
120,000 men to Tiehling or to Mukden,
and that number will be sufficient to
have prospects for the immediate
future.
The Standard, which comments upon
what it terms St. Petersburg's "attack
of nerves," and its not altogether sur
prising readiness to believe anything,
however disastrous, thinks that. if the
Russians can get to Harbin there will
be a long pause in thfe war. The same
paper has no doubt that the Japanese
will follow their enemy thither, as they
did to Liaoyang, but it does not think
that the pursuit can be carried out as
far as Harbin until after the winter
season. ' ~ T
The Daily Mail's Mukden correspond
ent, wiring under date of September 5,
appears impartially to sum up the situ
ation, saying that the relative positions
of the opposing forces are about the
same as ever. The enemy is advancing
from the south and threatening the
Russians at the same time from the
east, .but the decisive battle is still to
come.
LONDON, Sept. 7.â English opinion
regarding the situation in the Far East
is not much influenced by General Ku
ropatkin's reassuring dispatches. Al
most all of the difficulties of the retreat
reported, in. the SaÂ»estv<3lspatches have
been foreseen by the English military
observers and indeed the Russian con
fidence following so closely the period
of what was regarded here as exagger
ated depression, combined with com
plete Japanese silence regarding the
pursuit, leads the Daily Graphic to be
lieve that the Japanese generals "have
not yet given up all hopes of inflict
ing a crushing blow on the Russian
main army."

Kane says that he hid behind a sup
port of the bridge until Green was
within a few feet of him, when he
placed his revolver on a ledge and fired,
the bullet penetrating Green's> heart.
According to Kane's statement to the
police he killed Reynolds at 3 o'clock
in the afternoon. After closing the
saloon at 7 o 'clock at night Kane says
he started to go home and while cross
ing the Black Bridge recognized Green,
who was approaching him, as a strike

EAST ST. LOUIS. Sept. 6.â According
to statements made to-night to Chief
of Police Purdy by Louis Kane, for
merly a barkeeper in the Yellow Dog
Saloon, the latter is guilty of having
killed the two men found dead under
mysterious circumstances near Black
Bridge last night.
Kane, in his statement, says that his
reason for killing Reynolds, a white
man, and Green, a negro, was that they
were strike break'ers. He told Chief
Purdy that he was formerly employed
as a butcher and, although he had sur
rendered his card, he was a "strong
union man and had used every means
in his power to further the cause of
unionism."
In describing the killing Kane told
Chief Purdy that he and several strik
ing butchers had had an argument
with Reynolds and that the latter made
a motion as though to draw a revolver.
Kane says that he then shot Reynolds
through the heart and hid his body
in the bushes.

HAMMERFEST, Norway. Sept. 6. â
The Norwegian steamship Vircola,
which has arrived here, reports that
she met the Zeigler relief expedition
steamship Frithjof on August 27 in
latitude 79 north and longitude 52
east. The Frithjof up to that time had
been unable to reach Franz Josef
Land.
Meets Relief Expedition.
Here the message ended. The officer
who sent forward KirilofTs last dis
patch added:
"Kiriloff, who was an enthusiast in
his work, had gained universal respect
and sympathy. He was shot through
the right lung while standing by our
batten' and fell back, suffering in
tense agony, the blood spurting from
his mouth. Yet his devotion to duty
enabled him to overcome his sufferings.
He insisted upon being placed on a
horse so that he could get to Liaoyang
and file his dispatch. It took five hours
to cover the five and a half miles to
Liaoyang. When he reached there
Kiriloff was so exhausted and weak
from loss of blood that we got him into
the hospital, although against his pro
test. He asked me to complete his
message for him.
"I am a soldier and no writer, but I
will say that after the awful fight to
day we are still holding our positions.
Japanese bodies bestrew all the
heights. Their losses must run into
the tens of thousands. We. have lost
C000 thus far. A shrapnel shell burst
two paces from General Stakelberg
(who remained for fifteen hours under
fire), killing two officers. The general
was slightly wounded in the leg."
SOLDIER FINISHES MESSAGE.
"The Russian officers had not eaten
anything since the previous day and
the correspondent shared with them
what provisions he had. The taste of
food caused them to realize the inten
sity of their hunger. Prudence urged
the correspondent to leavÂ» the spot,
but he was fascinated."
"This morning around Liaoyang
guns thundered unceasingly. The
heights forming a semi-circle around
the city were dotted with jets of flame
and little black and white clouds. The
spectacle was clearly visible from the
water tower of Liaoyang. The Rus
sian left alone was not engaged.
"At 7 o'clock the correspondent rode
to the Russian center, where the Jap
anese were concentrating in an at
tempt to break through, and climbed
the neighboring heights, following a
detachment sent to relieve the skirm
ishers who had been covering the bat
tery commanded by Pokotlloff, one of
the heroes of Kiuleincheng. The Jap
anese, according to custom, were
sl'elling places where they believed
the Russian reserves were located. Be
fore tbe correspondent could, reach
the battery he had to cross a danger
zone of Io0 yards, projectiles falling
and bursting on it until the very
ground seemed to quiver with wrath.
TOUCHING BATTLEFIELD SCENE.
Â¦ "There was a touching scene when
the skirmishers were reached. A Rus
sian soldier met a brother whom he
had last seen in their native village.
There were joyous greetings and a
quick exchange of news from home.
Then each went his way and settled
down to the work of firing, coolly and
deliberately. The Japanese fire was
spasmodic. Their bullets sang like
birds as they sped overhead and the
Russians cracked jokes about it.
"Two hours later the correspondent
reached the battery and found that
Pokotiloff and another officer, Cos
troff, had been killed. Out of sixty
gunners forty were -killed or wounded.
Captain Tarasoff was in charge of the
batter>'. His quiet courtesy recalled
the hero of one of Count Tolstoi's nov
els. Fifty yards away was a splendid
looking gunner, whose duty it was to
record the success or failure of each
shot â the grim song of death, with
deadly messengers hurtling all around
him â but the Russian gunner stood
erect and utterly without heeding the
danger to which he was exposed.
MUKDEN, Sept. 6.â The following
message describing the earlier events
of the Japanese attack on General
Siakelberg's corps southwest of Liao
yeng on August 30 was written on the
battlefield by Kiriloff, the war corre
spondent, and sent to Mukden for
transmission just before he was shot
through the lung:
General Kuroki encountered des
perate opposition in the battle on the
heights to the west of Heiyingtal.
where he fought continuously and
fiercely for four days before he suc
ceeded in dislodging the Russians.
It is manifest that the stubbornness
of the Russian defense at Heiyingtal
saved the Russian line of retreat and
averted an overwhelming disaster.
Field Marshal Oyama says also
that, in spite of continuous attacks
for ten days against an enemy oc
cupying semi-permanent fortifications,
and the heavy resultant sacrifice, the
spirit of devotion #and determination
of the Japanese troops is excellent.
General Kuropatkin. according to
the report, continued to receive re
inforcements until August 13, and his
final strength consisted of at least
twelve full divisions (180,000 men).
The losses sustained by the Rus
sians are not known to the Japanese
field force.
The report says that the exact num
ber of Japanese losses since August Â£5
is not known at present, but that cas
ualty lists are being compiled. The
field marshal predicts that the losses
will prove heavy.
The reDort does not mention the
number of guns taken, but it is known
that sixteen guns were captured at
Anping and Anshanshan, and earlier
reports mentioned the capture and use
against the railroad station at Liao
yang of certain ten centimeter Cahet
guns.
railroad and other bridges over the
Taitse River.
Mortally Wounded Correspondent Rides for Flours
to File Graphic Story of the Battle.
Marshal Oyama seems to be making
a race for Mukden. He has great su
periority in numbers, especially in ar
tillery. -
As this dispatch was filed* the cor
respondent could hear the booming of
the Japanese cannon, which arein play
fourteen miles from Mukden. The
skies are black and the air is stifling
with the sense of suffocation, which i3
felt here " before a storm breaks â
strange harmony between the- elements
and the menacing attitude of the con
tending armies.
MUKDEN, Sept. 6.â The commissar
iat and columns of artillery are arriv
ing here and proceeding northward.
General Kuropatkin's army is engaged
in an extensive rear guard action.
The retreat of General Kuropatkin's
army is being carried out in good or
der, despite the terrible condition of the
roads, rendered sodden by . the rains
which fell yesterday and to-day, which
mire the lumbering guns and heavy
transport trains. Long lines of com
missariat wagons, drawn by steaming
mules, horses, and even bullocks, are
straining their v/ay north over the
soaking, cut T up main road 'from Yen
tai. Behind them come long trains of
artillery and back of them Kuropat
kin's army. The Japanese are hanging
to Kuropatkin's flanks, keeping the
Russians engaged in a continuous rear
guard action. The progress of the re
treating army has been slow, owing
to the necessity of first getting through
the baggage and guns, but the heads of
the commissariat trains already, have
passed through Mukden and are con
tinuing their way toward the north.
The main Japanese army- Is marching
up along the roads eastward of the
Russian lines of retreat, which con
verge at Mukden. Another â¢ Japanese
force is heading for. Mukden from the
westward, coming from the direction
of Liao River. JK
Port Arthur Expects Heavy Onslaught
':*/ by Land and Sea,
CHBFTJ, Sept. 6. â Firing at Port
Arthur was heard here to-night. Two
Chinese interpreters, belonging to the
official household of Lieutenant Gen
eral Stoessel, commander of the mill
.tary forces at Port Arthur, have been
caught spying at Shushiyen and Pa
lungshan. They were executed by the
Japanese.
Chinese who arrived here to-day
from Port Arthur declare that the
Russian garrison expects a general
land and sea attack on September 7.
On September 2 and 3 the Japanese
bombarded the fortifications severely
and two Russian guns on a fort near
Rihlungshan were dismounted.
The recent 'entrance into Port Ar
thur of a large steamship carrying
provisions, chiefly flour, has resulted
in the reduction of the price of flour
from *:Â» to i- a bag.
There are numberless stories of
heroism, collective and Individual,
v hich it is Impossible to relate by wire.
Ths Red Cross is working tirelessly,
not only aiding the wcunfled, but in es
tablishing booths by the roadside and
distributing food and tea to th* sick.
Injured and starving. The Chinese
population is in a state of ferment."
GENERAL. ATTAC1C TO-DAY.
MUKDEN. Sent. 6.â A Russian cor
respondent supplies the following:
"Our retreat is being carried out un
der heavy pressure and with the Japa
nese on our heels. The task Is ad
ditionally difficult owing to the terrible
condition of the roads and the rivers,
which are flooded. The fighting has
now been almost continuous since Aug
ust 24 and how much longer it will last
it is impossible to say. The number of
lives sacrificed and tbe loss of supplies
by burnlngr. bridges being blown up,
etc.. can only be explained when we
once more have concentrated, and tEis
w ill occupy us for some days.
"Do not be under any misapprehen
sion: we trill live through these heavy
days and still more alarming nights,
for despite recent failures, we have*
steadfast faith In the future and the
Fr'.rit of the troops is unimpaired.
JapanÂ»^=e Closely Press the Pursuit of
Koropatkln's Army.
ST. PETERSBURG, \\ ednesday,
Sept. '., 2:10 a. in. â There has been no
â¢TiCws from General Kuropatkin since
Monday .nfvernoon. This is attributed
to the interruption of direct communi
cation with the commander in chief,
on ing to the transfer of the telegraph
olSce to llukden. whither messages
have to be sent by courier.
The- utmost confidence prevails at
the War Office thai the Russian army
:* Elowrly but surely effecting the re
trcat without serious risk of being cut
oX None tne less, intense anxiety is
Mt throughout the whole nation and
this feeling: is shared by the Emperor.
His Majesty Is unwilling, at such a
juncture, to absent himself from
Ivterhof and has countermanded all
proposed journeys. He will not go to
Warsaw or Libau and remains closeted
tor hours with his military advisers.
li is believed that the outcome of
these deliberations will be an order to
mobilize several more army corps.
L^te last evening the following
BUttement was obtained from the War
Office:
"".No telegrams whatever were re
ceived from General Kuropatkin to
day (Tuesday). It is inferred that the
oi:ly Russian troops remaining at Yen
uii on September 6 were the rear
guard, whose mission is solely to re
tard the enemy's movement.
"It is quite consistent, from the po
sition of affairs, to suppose that a por
tion of the Japanese forces entered
Yentai. There being no intention to
hold this point, as it is of no intrinsic
importance. The stores have already
betn removed and whatever was not
removed was burned."
A Russian correspondent sent a mes
Â£;:ge from Mukden last evening, more
than twenty-four hours after the dis
patch of General Kuropatkin's last
published message. This correspond
ent gives :io details of the rear attack
and the censor probably is not al
hiwed to authorize the transmission of
ihis new? until the commander in
chief tend? his report.
The correspondent points out in his
message that the Russian forces are
fallowed step by step by the Japanese
and are greatly impeded by heavy
rÂ«<iiQs nr.d floods. He adds:
"It is impossible to say how long
the fighting wiil continue as the in
i::itt:ve is in Ihe hands of the Japan
esf-. 1
The correspondent does not conceal
th<- fact that the Russians are under
going a. severe ordeal, but he says
that the courage of the troops remains
undimiTiished.
?
FIGHTING IS CONSTANT
The war situation, in the' light or the latest information, may be sum
med up as follows: The Russian forces ar e pushing o n to Mukden, great
ly Impeded by heavy roads and floods, conducting an orderly retreat and
followed step by step by the Japanese. Details of the fighting and of the
exact iw-IUon of the opposing armies are lacking. The report that Ku
ropatkin's rear guard has been annihilated and that the Russian forces
are in danger of being surrounded is denied by the Russian general staff.
The Russian War Office Is entirely confident that the retreat is slowly but
surely being effected. From Tokio comes the oflicial report that the bulk
of the Russian force Is still at Yenlal. Field Marshal Oyama says that
the Rua-ians burned all the railroad bridges over the Taitsc River and re
ports that the Japanese losses are heavy. The attack on Port Arthur con
tinues and Chinese arriving at Chefn say the Russian garrison expects a
general land and sea attack to-day.

Rumor Says Nelson May Be Matched
to Fight Gans, Taking the Place
of Lowell Man.
The Gardner-Canole mixup at New
Bedford on Monday afternoon has set
the sports about town talking. There
were several rumors floating about
town last night and it would appear
the boxing enthusiasts do not think
60 much of Gardner now. Billy Pierce,
the well known Boston critic, wired
Alex Greggains last night to the effect
that Gardner was robbed and that
Canole never had a chance.
According to Pierce. Canole selected
the referee and the latter gave him all
the best of it throughout Pierce says
in his dispatch that Gardner floored
Canole several times and won easily
It was rumored last night that Greg
gaJns sent a telegram to Battling Nel
eon offering him the match with Joe
Gnns In place of Gardner.
Greggair.s denied this and stated that
*n enthusiastic admirer of Nelson had
dlFpatched the wire and that he himself
was perfectly satisfied with the match
However. Greggains did wire Gardner
to wait twecty-four hours before leav
ing for this city, so there may be some
change of programme. It was an
nounced when Gans reached here that
the Gardner-Canole fight was off and
that Gardner would take on a third
rater. The reported poor showing with
Canole is expected to materially reduce
interest ia the coming fight.

HAUVERMAN WILL COACH
STANFORD UNIVERSITY TEAM
Takes the Place With the Cardinal
Eleven Left Vacant by the Res
ignation of Billy Erb.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. 6.
Head Coach Lanagan announced to
day that C. D. Hauverman, '04. had
been secured to take the position of
assistant coach recently left vacant
by "Billy" Erb. Hauverman played on
last year's varsity and also during 1 the
season of 1901 and 1902. He ia con
sidered one of the best centers that
ever came to Stanford. Hauverman
will take charge of the freshman
squad next Thursday and will help
with the line men on the varsity team.
Dr. 'Williams has also beÂ»n secured
as an assistant coach. Williams was
also a strong center at Stanford and
was quick to get through the line and
block kicks. It is probable that sev
eral other Stanford alumni will de
vote part of their time to the coach
ing of individual Dositions-

The last of the doubles tennis teams
from Southern California were disposed
of yesterday in the tournament at San
Rafael. The northern players are thus
assured of at least one championship
title. Percy Murdock and Drumraond
MacGavin, the best northern team,
easily disposed of Fritz Overton and C.
Elliott of Los Angeles. The match was
close at times, but MacGavin and Mur
dock seemed able to win games when
ever it was necessary. . The first set
went to MacGavin and Murdock, with
the loss of only one game. In the sec
ond Overton and Elliott led at 4-2. but
their opponents, took the .next four
games handily. In the third set Over
ton and Elliott did less lobbing and
won from a 5-2 lead after their oppon
ents had almost evened up the score.
MacGavin and Murdock won the fourth
set without losing a game.
MacGavin was easily the star of the
four and did some remarkable smash
ing. His driving and serving were also
better than that of the other three.
Murdock gave his partner good sup
port but did not play as brilliant a
game. Overton played an excellent
game, but his partner, Elliott, was in
company a trifle to fast for him. 'Mac-
Gavin and Murdock are in the semi
finals and are almost sure to win. They
will meet either Allen and Baker or
Gardner and Rolfe in the finals. In the
semi finals MacGavin and Murdock
will have to dispose of Griffln and
Whitney. The final match will be
played Friday afternoon.
The singles has narrowed down to
five men and they are the best players
on the coast. In the upper half Over
ton and Murdock will come together
and in the lower half MacGavin will
meet the winner of the Hunt-Hendrick
match, which will be played this after
noon. >,"-Â¦' 'V ; -..'
Murdock played great tennis when he
beat Robert Vance three 6-2 sets.
In the ladies' singles Miss Florence
Sutton disposed of her sister, Mrs.
Bruce, easily. The score was 6-2, 6-4.
In the semi finals Miss Hazel Hotch
kiss beat Mis** Ethel Ratcliffe in
straight,sets. The winner played a re
markable game and many expressed
the opinion yesterday that she will
make either Violet or Florence Sutton
play their best to win. Miss Hotchkiss
plays one of these two in the finals and
a great match will result.
Only one match was played in mixed
doubles. In it Miss Violet Sutton and
Trowbridge Hendrick won two close
sets from Miss Bessie Valleau and
Drummond MacGavin. It was an in
teresting match from start to finish.
In the men's doubles two matches were
finished. In both the score stood two
sets all. Allen and Baker won the
fifth and deciding set from Variel and
Wayne easily, the score being 6-1. The
set between Whitney and Griffin and
Foley and Dunlar> was close and went
to the former by a score of 8-6.

victory- The making of runs was a
joke. It commenced in round one and
never ceased for more than an inning
or so at a time. Oakland settled down
to lose the game before It was well
commenced, and at that nobody seemed
to care. Score, 9 to 1.
Jones was not so bad until the team
commenced to accumulate a bunch of
miscues that faded the work of any
s=and lot collection that ever performed
in the southern portion of this village.
Doc Moskiman was the main erratic
kid. It was his inglorious work of boot
ing two straight in the fourth spasm
that put the Seals away to the good
and allowed them to go to .the wire in
a blind walk.
The entire game was one of the
hugest jokes that* has been foisted on
the unsuspecting fans this season. Of
course there was no crowd to look at
the game, but those who were watch
ing it became sore and made a few
unkind remarks about gold-brick ball
and false pretenses.
Pat Meany was back in the going
after a lay off of a few weeks and the
fans welcomed him heartily. Miller
gazed at the trouble from the bench,
while Anderson chased 'em around the
second sack. Schlafley and Streib are
both suffering from injuries and may
not be back in the game for many days.
The score:

CHICAGO, Sept. 6.â Only an ordinary
card was presented at Harlem to-day
and a small .crowd was in attendance.
Long shots had pretty much their own
way, winning four of the seven events.
Probably the best race of the after
noon was the third," a. mile and. seventy
yards affair. Fossil, on his previous
performance, looked to be In a. soft
spot and was always an odds on choice.
Opening at 7 to 10, he was pounded
down to 11 to; 20. Those whe never back
odds on choices took a chance on Wil
liam Wright, forcing him from 4 to 1
to 18 to 5. Foncasta went up from 4 tv
7 to 1. .

Two starters.
SHEEPSHEAD BAY, Sept. 6. â The
feeling of the regular racegoer to-day
was one of satisfaction, inasmuch as
there was an absence of the enormous
crowds ivhich invaded the grounds at
the Coney Island Jockey Club course
on Saturday and Monday. Still specu
lation was brisk and the volume of bet
ting on the last three "races was large.
Two decidedly unpleasant incidents of
the day were the serious injuries in
flicted upon Jockey Raynor, who rode
Dekaber in the fourth race, and the
busting of a blood vessel by Cock Rob
in, one of two horses which started in
the Oakdale Cup, a steeplechase for
horses ridden by gentlemen riders.
With respect to the injury inflicted
upon Rayner, the stewards announced
they could not get sufficient evidence, to
be able to punish either Jack Martin or
Hildebrand. who were the two jockeys
nearest to Rayner when his mount De
kaber was forced against the rails. De
kaber finished pulled up. Her rider's
left leg had been so gashed by the
fence rail as to be cut in two places and
it was necessary to lift him out of the
saddle at the paddock gate and take
him to the hospital tent. Meanwhile
Pulsus, at 5% to 1 and well backed, had
surprised the talent by leading all the
way and winning by a length and a
half from Marmee, with the favorite,
Cloverdale, running much below expec
tations. Major Daingerfleld was run
ning so strong: as they entered the
stretch that it seemed he had a chance,
but he curled up after that. The time
of the race, 2:06, is fair. It was the
first race won this season by Frederick
Gebhard, who is the owner of Pulsus.

The Stuten Island Company owns
fcOOO acres of land surrounded by the
eouth and wesa forks of the Mokei
umne River and the title dates back
for twenfy years. The land is said to
nÂ» worth 580.000. To prevent damage
from frfeshtts and overflows a levep
fcround the land has been maintained
at a larsre expense. It is alleged that
the defendants, in removing, mud from
the bed of the thread of the stream
have caused the water to undermine
t.he levee. The plaintifT says that it has
already suffered damages in the sum
of $5000 and will be put to an ex-
I t-nse of $20,000 in protecting its lands
Irom the action of the waters caused
by the dredging operations.
Farming: and dredging: Interests in
the San Joaquin Valley are in a con
flict that has brought them Into the
Fupenor Court of this county. Gar
ret \V. Mc-Enerney as attorney for the

"The trip to Tahiti," he said yester
day, "is the finest rest-cure in the
world. The strong gain in Ktrengtn
and the weakness of the ailing disap
pears long before Tahiti is reached.
The soft but bracing breezes in which
one lives from the time the liner
clears the coast fog-belt until she
strikes it again on her* return put life
into one as does no tonic of which I
have any knowledge. For the well
and the weak the trip to Tahiti is an
ideal vacation and for the tired busi
ness man I know of nothing that so
thoroughly fills the bill. Traveling on
the Mariposa one has all the com
forts and luxuries of a private yacht.
From the time we left San Francisco^
until to-day, on land and sea, we nave
enjoyed every moment of the time."
The Marlposa's cargo included: 10,
529 sacks of copra, 61,734 cocoanuts,
shells, vanilla boans and fruit.
Dr. E. Mellis of this city, who came
up on the Maripoaa, spent two months
at Tahiti and is charmed both witli
the island climate and with the Marl
posa.
The steamship Mariposa, Captain
Rennie, which arrived yesterday, elev
en days seventeen hours from Tahiti,
brings word of the loss of the gaso
line schooner Elmeo, which was driv
en ashore on the reefs surrounding
an island of the Pomotu group. Tiie
Eimeo was built at Benicia by
Matthew Turner. She was used as an
inter-island passenger* carrier and waa
crowded with people when driven
ashore during a heavy etorm. No lives
were lost, but hope of saving the ves
sel had been abandoned when the
Marij osu sailed.
The Mariposa brought eighteen pas
sengers from the Paradise of the Pa
cific. Most of the passengers were
travelers for health and pleasure and
the appearance of. each waa a testi
monial to the health-giving virtue or
a visit to the South Seas.

Hughes paid Vogelsang $30 and re
ceived a receipt in return. Sunday
niprht he again set out for the wedding
in Buffalo. The experience cost him S2i
for a Pullman for himself and friend
to Chir-ago, $3 for rid- to Sacramento.
S5 for room and breakfast for himself
and friend at the Golden Eajrle and $50
fine. He was preatly pleaded at Vogel
isang's coprtesy in not makinjr him re
turn to M^ndocino County and compli
mented the Fish Commission on its
vigilance.
Justice of the Peace Kenworthy of
willits, who had issued the warrant,
was called up by telephone and the
matter was vxplained to him. Attorney
Craig of Willits was engaged to repre
sent Hughe* and the trial by telephone
took place as previously mentioned.
A Mendocino County deputy heard
from one of the lawyer's friends that
he wojild start for the E*st on Satur
day's overland train. Vogelsang knew
that his quarry's name was Hughes
end that he was probably on the train,
so the officer got aboard. Hughes got
Â¦wind of the fact that he was followed
and Instead of showing his through
ticket, paid a cash fare to Sacramento.
Members of the lawyer's party said
the man's name was E. J. Lovett.
By process of elimination Vogelsang
finally spotted his game, and with the
aid of the conductors, made him
acknowledge his identity. Officer,
prisoner and the prisoner's friend
alighted at Sacramento and spent Sat
urday night at the Golden Eagle Hotel.
Hughes said he was due in Buffalo.
N. Y-, to attend a wedding in which he
was to be best man, and could not
possibly return to Mendocino County.
Vogelsang decided to do the best he
could for his victim under the circum
stances and evolved the idea of a tele
phone trial.
'"Very well, Mr. Hughes; I will fine
you ?.Â«-' and warn you not to repeat
tbe offense."
This conversation over 200 miles of
wire constituted the trial of a rich
Eastern attorney last Sunday before
Justice of the Peace Kenworthy of
"Willits. The unique trial by telephone
was evolved in the fertile brain of
Chief Deputy Vogelsang of the Fish
Commission, who had arrested Hughes
oa an eastbound train for killing deer
in Mendocino County in violation of
the game laws.
The defendant had been camping
near Willits for several weeks. It caroe
to the ears of the Fish Commission
thai he had shot deer before the season
opened- They could not prove this,
however, but one of the deputies suc
ceeded in finding a doe hide near
Hughes' camp. A warrant for the ar
rest of the eportainan waa issued, but
he could not be found in Mendocino
County. Vogelsang learned that the
man was coming to this city, but could
not find him here.
"I em, sir, and I wish to plead guilty
to a violation of the game laws of this
State."
"Hello! Is this Judge Kenworthy?"
"Yes, and are you Charles Hughes
of Utica, New York?"

TRAP IS NEATLY LAID
ASSETS EXCEED DEBTS
After Outstanding
Claims the Executors Will
Then Have Two Millions
A petition for a .partial distribution
of the rich 'estate of Adolph Sutro has
been filed . by the residuary devisees
and it throws some light upc-n the pres
ent condition and value of the holdings.
The petitioners are Emma L. Merritt,
Rosa V. Movbio, Kate Nussbaum,
Charles W. iSutro, Edgar E. Sutro ana
ClaTa A. English. They declare that
the cash legacies have been paid with
the exception of the sum of $92,593 71,
together with a sum not exceeding
$125,000 claimed by certain alleged lega
tees, the validity of which claims are
nc-w in dispute.
It is stt forth in the petition that
the estate is but little indebted and the
shares asked for car. . be distributed
without loss to the creditors. The in
debtedness of the estate does not ex
ceed S41D/000. and the attorneys' and
executors' fees will not exceed $125,000,
while the value of the estate in the
hands of the executors is said to be
mere than $2,500,000.
Mrs. Merritt, as executrix, yesterday
returned to the court a report of the
sale, on August 29, to Thomas J. Bar
bour, of four blocks of outside lands
for ?158,120.
Bearing upon the final effort to reach
an understanding as to the full value of
the Sutr.o estate an order was made
by Judge^ ColTcy appointing three men
to reappraise the several lots in the
vicinity of Fulton street and Forty
eighth avenue and extending to Forty
sixth avenue and B street.

been written by Cosmo Hamilton, but
the plot of it was evolved by Captain
Marshall, author of "His Excellency,
the Governor." The captain, however,
had so much work arranged- for that
there was no telling when he could
get around to elaborating the "Cinder
ella" idea, so Charles Frohmanâ who
thought it a particularly good oneâin
duced him to turn it over to Cosmo
Hamilton, probably not Just for love,
however. "The Catch of the Season
is expected to reopen the Vaudeville
about September 1. Meanwhile, Cap
tain Marshall's comedy, "The Duke of
Kllliecrankie." in which John Drew 13
to be seen at home, continues to pleass
at the Criterion, where it has run for
over six months. .
If only Oscar Asche gets something
like adequate support from the public,
his coming essay at management may
have rather important results. Asche
has only been seen once In the United
States, this being when he went over
to play "Maldonado," the financier in
Pinero's "Iris." A graduate of the Ben
son Shakespeare repertoire companies,
he and his pretty and clever wife have
been with Beerbohm Tree for some
time, but As"che Is now starting In on
his own hook with his life partner,
Lily Brayton. as leading woman. He
will occupy the Adelphi and there will
produce on September 16 a poetical
tragedy called "The Prayer of the
Sword," by a young playwright who.
like Stephen Phllllp3. was also a mem
ber of the Benson companies. After
ward Asche will give Shakespeare's
"Taming of the Shrew," to be followed
by a fantastic comedy, the rights of
which he has acquired, and this, in
turn, will give place to more Shakes
peare. It is an ambitious programme
and one whose success seems rather
doubtful with the public daft over
musical comedy. Asche. however, evi
dently means to have a fair try for
favor, having engaged a strong' com
pany and most of its members for a
solid year. He says, by the way, that
he will have nothing to do with the
star system. "We want good play3,"
he declared yesterday. "Our choice will
not depend at all on whether there are
important parts particularly suitable
to myself. We shall adapt our cast to
the play. We do not want plays madÂ©
to fit the cast."
PARIS, Aug. 20.â In theatrical circles
here the one topic of discussion is the
1 odd theme which Edmond Rostand, the
long-silent author of "Cyrano" and
"L'Aiglon," has chosen for his new
play. "Chanteclair"â the French epic
word for roosterâ is ,a highly appro
priate name for this piece, in which
all the characters are birds. Now it
is announced that the cock who figures
prominently in the fantasy will be rep
resented by Coquelin. This barnyard
fowl, it seems, has a secretâ is it* he
who causes the sun to rise?â regarding
which he is continually chaffed by a
thrush, whose social position gives him
a place on the first branch of trees. A
nightingale acts as the god from the
machine and brings to an end this
queer drama, for which Paris is wait-
Ing eagerly. It has not yet been de
cided where "Chanteclair" will be
given.
Probably Shakespeare would "spell
ruin" no longer if his plays could be
produced everywhere as Beerbohm
Tree presents them in London. The
London actor-manager has given "A
Midsummer Night's Dream," "Twelfth
Night" and "Julius Caesar" with set
ting such as neither Irving nor Augus
tln Daly ever approached, but his com
ing revival of "The Tempest" promises
to s ,be the most elaborate thing he has
done yet. Among the big scenes will be
'the opening of "the first act. In this
a ship, measuring over forty feet in
length, will sail through the storm, her
crew crowded on "deck, and should
make a fine spectacle. Another will be
the sandy shore of the island, from
which pretty girls will arise to dance
on the waves. A feature is to be made,
too, of Prospero's magic, and to. this
end some clever illusions are now be
ing arranged by the ingenious Mr. Mas
kelyne of the Egyptian Hall. Sir Ar
thur # Sullivan's incidental music will be
used" as well as some additional num
bers which have been written by Ray
mond Roze. ,

ANSWERS
10 QUERIES
AG. HALES, the veteran war correspondent who has been
supplying the London Daily News with reports of the fight
â¢ing in the Far East, recently contributed an article to that
journal^ which reveals in searching style the chief cause of Russia's
disastrous conduct of the war on land. As we have surmised from
admission's on the part of Russian high officials, the Czar's cohorts
in Manchuria were not ready for war. The reason of their, unpre
paredness Hales details unsparingly.
"It is known in St. Petersburg now, as , was known in Tokio for
a year before the war commenced/' says Hales, "that when a mil
lion's worth of supplies were supposed to be sent to certain troops,
not a quarter of the amount ever reached the men and officers on
whom the empire was depending for great deeds in dangerous
times. The soldiers were robbed. They were kept short of nearly
everything that a soldier requires."
The correspondent specifically points out how at the hands of the
army of jobbers the men in the ranks- had boots of cardboard and
greatcoats of shoddy doled out to them grudgingly, how the artil
lery was, in many instances, hardly up to the grade of fair scrap
iron, how ammunition existed largely in the written reports, that on
band being often too old or too obsolete to be served in the guns.
The army Kuropatkin found when he went to fight the Japanese in
Manchuria was, according to Russian admissions, merely a make
shift, designed to do yeoman's work until the military arm at home
could gather itself together from the surprise of Japan's sudden
attack.
In the light of these disclosures the fight that Kuropatkin and
Stoessel's armies have been putting up shows an element of the
heroic. Outpointed in equipment, in morale, in the fundamentals of
fighting effectiveness, the Russians in Manchuria are not outdone in
bravery as the details of their desperate resistance attest.

Perhaps the girls are more prone to

gested, with all due deference to possi

great danger in the common habit of

of tortureâ through her long-antici

Wearing of Low Shoes
A Dangerous Practice
"Where did you get that exquisite
organdy waist?" asked a girl.the other
day of a friend who wore a dainty
creation that buttoned up the back
with tiny lace buttons.
"I'll let you into the secret," said
the friend. "It is not a particularly
fine organdy, or swiss rather, for it is
swiss, which washes better than or
gandy â but it looks, so because I wear
it over the thinnest kind of a white
wash silk blouse, which Is made plain
ly, but along the same lines. This
gives the swiss a cloudy, filmy and
kind of billowy effect : that Â¦ makes it
look like chiffon. It 'throws up' each
little thread of the lace trimming, so
that it appears like something costly
instead of the ordinary wash valen
ciennes, which it is. And it gives a
soft effect to the skin. .
"The lining, too, saves the swiss, so
that by washing It out in the wash
bowl and nressing it when nearly dry
the waist itself can be worn two . otr
three times without doing .iip. Be
sides all this, instead of having. to lay
the whole thing away this fall I.in
tend to wear it with the lining * all
winter. Try it yourself," added the
girl generously, "but be sure and get
the softest and lightest silk possible,
as a more expensive quality will not
mix so artistically with the .waist fab
ric and look so much -like a part of
it." â Chicago' Tribune.

THE EXCELSIOR
OF KUR0PATKIN
'""PHE full statement of casualties in the battle of Xiaoyang is
not yet at hand, but from the partial reports made for the sev
* cral days of the continued action it is evident that in killed
alone the number will exceed the total casualties in any action at
arms since the invention of gunpowder. .,*' J
The greatest modern battles were fought in our Civil War. In
those actions it was pluck against pluck and grit against grit. The
largest number engaged in one action was at Fredericksburg, where
the Union army had 113,000 men and the Confederate 78,513, a total
of 191,513. The Confederate loss was 1284 killed, 9606 wounded and
1769 missing; the Union loss 608 killed, 41 16 wounded, and 653
missing, making a grand total of casualties of 18,036. The next
great battle, measured by the number of men in collision and the
casualties, was Gettysburg, the decisive battle of the war. There
the Union army numbered 97,361 and the Confederate 75,268, a total
of 172.629. Though the number of men in action was less than at
Fredericksburg, the casualties were much greater. The Federal army
lost 3072 killed, 14497 wounded, 5434 missing; the Confederate army
loss was 2592 killed, 12,709 wounded and 5150 missing. This was
a grand total of 45,354, of which the killed in both armies numbered
5664. It was a great and stubbornly fought action, in which every
form of offense was used, artillery, rifle, bayonet charge and cavalry
charge, and desperate courage was displayed by both sides. Yet
looking back upon it the number killed on the field was- surprisingly
small. - -i;;
Since then, however, there has been great improvement in arms.
The army rifle has a larger range, and the fired ammunition and ex
plosives "are all different. Not only in small arms has there been
a substitution of more efficient weapons, but the artillery is of greater
range and more rapid fire. These things alone account somewhat for
the greater destruction in the battles fought in the current war in
Â¦Eastern Asia.
In the action at Liaoyang it is believed that a half million of
men have faced each .other. The Russians have labored under the
disadvantage of having no reserves. Kuropatkin's policy of choosing
his ground for a stand and gathering upon it his entire force, has
brought his entire army under Japanese fire, so that there could be
no reserve maintained, out of danger, to come into action and re
lieve the troops jaded by long fighting. The Japanese generals in
this respect outclassed him. They repeat Napoleonic tactics, by hav
ing immense reserves, rested and fresh, ready for duty, while the
jaded recruit. These tactics permit that incessant assault which
gives the enemy no rest.
The outside world will have to wait for the reports of the sev
eral commanders, before knowing just what has happened in that
awful battle. Both armies exclude war correspondents from any
close view of the fighting. On the Japanese side the newspaper men
were permitted to snuff the battle afar off, at the comfortable dis
tance of eight miles. It is evident that none got any nearer the
Russian side, so that reports from that source are mostly the re
sult of imagination. It is the first modern war, modern in' the
sense of the rise of the newspaper, in which the belligerents have
succeeded in completely muzzling the war correspondents. In the
Russo-Turkish war Forbes, the great English war correspondent,
had the right of way in both armies. He sat alone with the Czar
in his field tent, and was able to write vividly, as an observer in
touch with events. Now the newspaper men, except for what local
color they get, can write up the war just as well at their home desks.
The Japanese officers have been very soldier-like in their re
porCs, which are believed to be accurate, and lack the dramatic ele
ment entirely. The Russians are the same, though they employ a
pardonable euphemism when they call a retreat "a change of po
sition."
From the reports given out by both sides it is evident that the
total killed will equal all the casualties of Fredericksburg and Get
tysburg combined, or a number but little short of the whole Con
federate force at Gettysburg.' While no man can foresee the effect
upon the world's political and commercial geography, it is with no
desire to underestimate the effect of Gettysburg or Sedan that one
may predict that the battle of Liaoyang will have the greatest per
manent effect upon the world's future history of any action since
Marathon or Tours.
Some of the Continental military critics try to minimize the
Japanese victory at Liaoyang because Kuropatkin's army was not
captured. But Lee's army was not captured at Gettysburg. It re
treated into Virginia, but the forces of Meade were left in possession
of the field, and the battle was decisive of the war.

Strangers are possibly not aware that
San Francisco is the most important fur
center, and that mostly all the entire
collection of Alaska skins reach this
port before being distributed to other
parts of the United States and Europe.
We therefore cordially welcome those
who would like to visit a rare collection
of furs and fine specimens of skins, such
as we are now exhibiting at the St. Louis
Exposition. It would be well worth your
while to pay a visit to the largest exclu
sive fur house in the world.

Invitation to Strangers.
The witness testified that in April,
1904, she and Miss Dolbeer sailed for
Europe and that at that time- the latter
seemed to be in good health. On the
return to New York, said Miss War
ren, there were no symptoms of mental
aberration in Miss Dolbeer's condition.
Hiram W. Johnson, attorney for the
contestants of the Dolbeer will, did all
the questioning during the taking of
the deposition. He brought out the
claim that on April 3. 1904, Miss Dol
beer telephoned to T. S. Watson, a
lumber dealer,* that she wished to make
her will. The deponent accompanied
Miss Dolbeer to Watson's office, but
she heard nothing further regarding
the will. Practically this ended the
questioning for the day. Miss Warren
was dismissed with injunctions to re
port to-day at 2 o'clock p. m. for
further questioning.
Undoubtedly the Johnson brothers
expect to spring a great sensation as
a result of Miss Warren's deposition.
Neither of them made any effort to
keep the contents of the testimony
secret and said that the closed door
policy was entirely due to a ruling
obtained from Probate Judge Coffey
at the request of Miss Warren's attor
ney.
"In the interest of our clients," said
Albert Johnson, Â¦ "we are making a
fight to a finish. We expect to show
many things that will be sensational.
If necessary we shall have, witnesses
from Paris, New York and San Fran
cisco to testify in favor of our clients.
What this testimony may be will de
pend largely on developments In Miss
Warren's depositions. Unless she ad
mits many things we shall have to re
but her testimpny."
The attorneys f iM Miss Warren re
fused to talk regarding her deposition.
â¢ The deposition of Miss Warren as
far as taken developed no sensations.
She testified to her first employment
by Miss Dolbeer as nurse at wages -of
$30 a month. In this capacity she
served for several years and was
finally advanced to $40 a month. For
sixteen years she had been Miss Dol
beer's companion, she said. During
that time deponent and hor dead mis
tress toured Eastern cities at intervals
averaging two years. Miss Warren
had never noticed signs of illness in
Miss D"'h*Â»er. uotil the spring of 1904.
Then sue had complained of sleepless
ness and seemed depressed. She re
ceived treatment from Drs. McGonigle,
Lewltt and MofflL The last named ad
vised the. rest cure for Miss Dolbeer
and a different nurse.
Miss Etta Warren, main inheritor of
the estate of the late Miss Dolbeer. was
technically on the witness stand yester
day. After several summonses she con
sented to have her deposition taken in
the offices of Johnson & Johnson, on
the ninth floor of the Mills building.
Veiled to a depth that baffled photog :
raphers to catch her features, Miss
Warren entered the elevator of the
Mills building under an escort of E. S.
Pillsbury, William Mugan, George D.
Gray and Miss Alexander, an attendant
of the late heiress. These were con
ducted to the inner offices of Johnson
Brothers. Garret . McEnerney, attor
ney for Miss Warren, arrived fifteen
minutes later anl was immediately
shown to the inner rooms. All
were barred.

In a straight path and the machine was
then led back to the starting point*.
The airship consists of .{-Â£ a ".' cigar

It has a ten-horse power engine, run
with hydrogen 1 gas. The. bag is. about
seventy feet long and hap- sixteen pro

ST. LOUIS, Sept. 6.â T. C. Benbow.
a' Montana aeronaut, is the first man to
sail an airship over the World's Fair
aeronautic course. He made a trial r a.s-.
cension to-day and demonstrated .that
his machine is dirigible, but owing to
scarcity of power he was unable/- to
propel it without great difficulty
against the wind. â¢' * "Â¦Â¦ .
These officials admitted that their, ac
tion might "be open tO'Crtllcism from a
strictly legal standpoint,; but Â¦' Justified
their^acts by saying it was for the pub
lic good'an'd for the improvement of the
service. Judge Wellborn holds this ; po
sition is untenable' and, as against' both
the ' le'tter and the , spirit of the inter
state commerce. act,- By the. arbitrary
routing />'f as confessed by
the railroad officials themselves,, they
secured the absolute cotntrol of the'en
tire business, thereby preventing .con
necting, roads from competing for the
business -and ! not merely '-restricted
competition, but absolutely destroyed it.

closely* typewritten pages. He sustains
practically every point "advariced" byithe :
shippers.- The keynote ot' the decision
is the declaration,? that v v the, arbitrary
routing of fruit shipments, by. the initial
lines is contrary to the : provisions of,
the interstate commerce, act in that it
destroys competition and places â¢ the
shipper at the mercy of the v rallroad

cials of the railways, during -the hear
ing, in which they : admitted : that ' the

ments was for the purpose , of stopping

- A number . of * variations la^ Hides appear.
Light Steers and heavy Cows are lower.' Stags
At the start the wheat market was decidedly
weak, the December option being down *ic to
%c to ' /S @lc at $1 05% to $1 06%. The Initial
decline was due to general selling, with only
a moderate demand.- Lower cables, heavy
world's shipments and liberal receipts in the
Northwest were the influences that brought on
the selling pressure. Heavy offerings by an
influential operator was a feature of the early
session. Pit traders' were apparently discon
certed' by the action of the big holders, and
the â¢ re*ult was quite free profit- taking. Be
fore the ' declining tendency could be checked
December sold oft to '$105%. During the day
reports'- were received from Minneapolis to the
effect that rains in the Northwest were much
more general than indicated by the Weather
Bureau reports. These advices tended to check
the' downward trend of price's. The weekly
Government report also was bullish, the claim
being made that wet weather had interfered
with harvesting and had injured the grain in
shock in Minnesota. In North Dakota dam
age by rust and smut was becoming more pro
nounced. A partial confirmation ot these ad
vices was the strength at Minneapolis. Dur
ing the last hour of trading most of the early
loss was regained on covering by* shvrts, De
cember advancing to $1 06?Â«. The market
closed firm with December at'$l O0%@1 06%.
Corn closed firm at about the best prices
of the day. December opened %tÂ»%cto %@%c
lower at 5038tÂ«51^4c, sold between 50%c and
51%@BlTsC and closed at 51-fic.
Oats held steady within a small range. De
cember opened unchanged to %c lower at 33c
to 'M%c, ranged between 32%&32 1 j8C and 33% c
and closed at 33c.
Â¦ Owing to a break in the ranks of the strik
ing stock yards employes there was more snap
to trading in provisions than had- been mani
fested for some time. The market was firm
early, but eased, off on realizing sales. At the
cloEe October, pork was down 12 %c, lard was

New York Stock Market
NEW YORK, Sept. 6.â The stock market
gave a good account of Itself to-day and
confounded its unfriendly critics by extend
. in; its already considerable rice and by . an
i Increase in the volume of activity. The mar
ket was under suspicion of manipulation, as
it has been for some time, but the advance
in prices was effected without bringing out
any insupportable burden of genuine selling.
The market was spotted all day. and during
the early part of the sesslon-'was Irregular on
account of several weak points, but the tone
gained in strength during the course of the
session and the earlier points Of weakness
were overtime. Jhe principal supply of stocks
fcr sale came from London and was largely
on crbitrae* account, owing to th,e more rapid
advance than expected. There was some de
l>rtsfion in London, however, attributable to
thv.- disappointment at the prospect of a pro
longation of the war in the Far. "East, with
its burdens on the world's money markets.
United States Steel preferred was also a center
of positive depression. The decline of a. point
in this security was presumably due to- the
prosj>ett of a reduction In the nrices of steel
products, the effects of 'which on .the net
earnings of the corporation is dreaded. But
tbe!Â«e influences v.-ere effectually ' contended
with and overcome in'iplte oF'the skeptical
attitude of the traders toward the' market.
Coinniifsion-house business remained at a low
level ard the poor bank statement of Satur
day induced some selling from this source.
The Pacifies took the leadership of the late
market. Stress was laid upon the very cheer
ful tone of railroad traffic officials' reports.
The crain movement for last week was seen
to be heavily expanded and traffic officials!
both of trunk lines and of Western lines were .
emphatic in assertions of a liberal westward
movement of all kinds of merchandise.
The grod progress of the corn crop reported
by the Weather Bureau's weekly bulletin was
a factrr In the strength of the grangers and
Pacifies.
The ixjnd market was quiet. Total sales

ra'.sJn making are progressing rapidly. The
Kiaje crop is large and of excellent quality,
the raisin grapes having a high percentage of
sugar. Tokays are going to market in car
load lots and wine crapes are nearly ready
for the crusher. Prone picking jand drying
are in progress; the crop Is large in most
places and of excellent quality. Late peaches
in the vicinity "of Stockton are said to be a
failure. Other deciduous fruits have yielded
fair crops In mo6t sections, but are. generally
below average. Almond harvest is well ad
vanced: the crop is very light In the vicinity
of LodL Oranges at Porterville continue in
good condition and a large crop Is probable.
The fonrth crop of alfalfa is of excellent
quality and the yield is large. The recent
rains .in the mountains were . beneficial in re
plenishing the canals and furnishing a plenti
ful supply of irrigating water.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.â Hot. dry
weather prevailed during the week and con
ditions were favorable . for raisin making, fruit
drying and bean harvesting. Grapes are yield
ing an unusually heavy crop, especially In
the Irrigated . districts, and the quality is ex
cellent. The deciduous * fruit crop is consid
erably below average. Citrus orchards are
looking well in sections where water Is plenti
ful, but present indications are that the crop
will be lichter than expected earlier in the
season. Walnuts continue In good condition,
but the crop will not be aÂ» large as antici
pated. Sugar beets at. Santa Maria are above
average. Bean harvest continues and the
jield is generally below average. The honey
crop at Riverside is a failure. Late planted
pctatoe? are ma!-:!ng good growth. The recent
rains saturated the soil in the foothill and
mountain districts and all streams are running.

COTTQN.
1 Â¦ r ~zi '
Sept. 6, 19C4. â For the- Information of many
inquiring friends I publish the following In re-
ply to a letter addressed to me by a gentle-
man in the South criticising my recent pub-'
. llcly expressed chanse of opinion la regard to
the cotton market.
I may say that the developments of to-day'
do not lead me to modify my expectation of
substantially lower prices for cotton during the
period when receipts are likely to be heaviest.
, and I think that those who have cotton -which
they must dispose of within the next two
months will do wisely to accept current quota-
tions. . . â¢ . Â¦
NEW YORK. Sept. 3. 196*.
Dear Sir: I reply particularly to your letter
, received to-day. In which you sugge'st that my
recent change of front in regard . to the prob- '
able course of the cotton market will deprive
me of all following and any capacity oX mar-
ket leadership in future.
In resly thereto. I beg to say. first, that I
do not asoire to so-called market leadership,
and think it a detriment rather than an Advan-
tage so far as It affects a speculator's money-,
making capacity. It burdens him with a moral
responsibility for other people's transactions
and renders It difficult for htm to liquidate his
own. So far as my change cf opinion is con-
cerned. I can only quote you Emerson'* trite
remark that "consistency ts a weakness of ibe
narrow minded." and tell you with' Josh Bil-
lings that "a wise man changes his opinions:
a fool never."- I reserve the right to change
my opinions -without, however, arrogating to
myself, by Implication even, any superior wis-
dom. It Is because I sometimes seÂ« that other
people are wiser than I am that I change my
opinions. â¢ J -
TWO CLASSES Of TACTS.
To my- thinking there axe two classes
of facts which the speculator in cotton
! or In anything else, must be constantly
In search of: One is. facts mathemat-
ical, which may be subdivided Into facts abso-
1 lute and fact* deductive. The other class U
fact* physiological, which, although exceeding-
; ly illusive, are quite as- important as mathe-
matical certainties In dealing- with aa article
In which the speculative public is as "enormous
as that at present trading In cotton.
You must bear In mind that there ar* prob-
ably not less than ten thousand people actively
Interested In the cotton market at all times,
and In periods of great activity this number ts
largely Increased. If each of these persons
buys or sells only one hundred bales, the de-
mand for or supoly of contracts thus created
represents an aggregate of 1.000,000 bales 'of
cotton and Is a force that Is simply overwhelm-
ing In Its preponderance. Once set In action
by any leader It generally goes to excesses that
overwhelm him. and carry him and his follow-
ing to disaster, aa witness the Sully Debacle of '
last spring. | It becomes,- therefore. In my opin-
ion, very tmoortant to anticipate correctly. If
possible, the impulses which move or set tn
action this irresistible force of public specula-
tion, and it Is equally. Important that any ten-
dency toward exaggerated opinion and hyster-
ical action shall be overcome. .; .
GRADUALLY DECLINING PRICES. <j
It was because I saw, or thought I saw; that
a great many people who had no possible use
for cotton. , excest to resell it .at aa advance,'
had bought It In 'the form of contracts, that I
sold out my cotton on Thursday momiar last,
and Immediately thereafter advised the public
of the fact; and It Is because I now see, or
think.- 1 see. that : the ' Government ' report. Is-
sued on Friday. Is certain to result In - a re-
crudescencce of the 12.000,000 bale talk that I
am unwilling to buy cotton for an advance
until Â»f>er some . comparative decline tn thÂ«

This cannot Â¦ soaslb!y occur within the next
two months and I therefore think my expecta-
tion of gradually declining prices for tbÂ» next
two months Is sound. You must tear tn mind
that the f sinner ts the final arbiter of cotton
values. If there were no SDlndles to nae it.
cotton would aot be worth anything, however
small the croo. . It was the withdrawal of the
spinner that punctured last year's speculation,
and In the face ot a resort from " th* Govern-
ment which *o effectively negatives individual
reports of crop shortage, the spinner la not go-
1 Ing to buy cotton except at what. he considers
a reasonable nrlce. . . " Â¦ ' Â« Â¦
Meantime we are face to face with probably
the largest SeÂ»tember and October receipts on
record, and In my Opinion the effect of this
movement. In -, combination ..with ;â¢> probably
slick demand from manufacturers, will create
within the next sixty day* a bearish sentiment
so ktraur that It would overwhelm â¢ either you
or myself should ' we attempt ' ts oppoâ It.

About three weeks ago Collins was
arrested on comulaint of his mother

Rhea told this story without a- quiver
and convinced the officers that he was
speaking the truth or else knew a great
deal about the robbery.
"Finally, becoming discouraged, * I
drifted tp> Arizona and worked on
many railroads in the Territory and
Southern California. Two years ago
I determined to unearth the treasure
and journey to the north once more. "I
was*not watched this time and I found
no trouble in locating the spot. â¢
"Digging in the ground I came across
a nest of shining, gold pieces, but the
sacks priginally holding them had rot
ted away. I â¢ took a few shiners and,
covering the hole, went down town to
get some sacks, but there I got drunk.
When I sobered up I found. that detec
tives were, dogging my every footstep
and I dared not go back to dig again.
Now. I am willing to show the hiding
place of the money, for I am tired of it
all and want my conscience at rest."

"1 knocked about, for several years
and then went to look for the .money,
but "I was certain that detectives were
on my track and I was forced to wait.

but was frightened away a, second
time. > Â¦Â¦. . . .::
"I knew that I would be watched for

train, escaped in a horse and wagon.
We abandoned the wagon, leaving
overcoats, .masks and other things be

He gave up readily,- but one of the
robbers shot four bullets among the
passengers, one of them taking effect
in the body of a man named Fergu
son. The $15,000 was taken and until
Rhea's confession no trace of it has
yet been 'discovered.
Rhea made the following statement
to the two officers who are bringing
him north to verify his declarations:
"I was one of the men that held up
Gilson in 1S92 and stole $15,000 from
him. I am ready now to make a con
fession of the crime, for it Is the only
one I ever committed In all my life and I
I want a clear conscience now," began I
Rhea. !
â¢ "I am an old man now, past GO years,
and I want peace for my tortured soul.
If the Judson people want to. give me
half of the money when I reveal the
hiding place they may do so, j but 1 1
would prefer that they give me one- j
third, you officers one-third and keep j
the remainder. However, I am - going j
to tell the entire story and give up the;
money, even if I fail to get a cent. j
The crime of w,hich Rhea pleads
guilty was one of the most sensa
tional robberies that have ever oc
curred in the State. Paymaster Gil-
Fon of the Union Iron Works left San
Francisco on April 24, 1S92, with
$15,000 to pay off the employes of
the Judson Iron Works. When the
train reached E f tation two men
with pistols confronted the paymaster
and demanded the satchel. â¢ ...
CRIME WAS BOLD ONE.
According to Los Angeles advices
Rh-ea has confessed his complicity in \
the hold-up. He professes a knowl- {
edge and a desire to dig up the buried j
treasure. Secret Service Agent Cro
nin and Detective Boyd placed faith
enough in the fellow's story of the
buried treasure to bring him from Los
Angeles to Oakland to search for the
missing money. . j
Chief of Police Hodgkins of Oakland {
is skeptical regarding the statement of |
the prisoner. Rhea was arrested on ,
suspicion shortly after the robbery, but I
was discharged for lack of evidence. !
Chief Hodgkins thinks that Rhea is,
trying to make notoriety for hiiyself 1
and incidentally to get transportation^
and food on a trip to San Francisco, j
In an interview last night he stated j
that there was nothing to connect Rhea \
with the holdup of Gilson and the theft
of $15,000.

The State- Mineralogist declined yes
terday to say anything about the'trou
bles at St. Louis. He admitted that all
had not been smooth sailing. He said
that the California mineral show; had
attracted the attention of ' hundreds of
thousands and. being- more varied "than
any other at the exposition, ; had well
maintained the reputation of California
for mineral wealth. . â¢ ,.-..:
After a time the California, commis
sioners and the' State Mineralogist will
be compelled to report to the State
Legislature. The' initiated believe that
both reports will, contain much more
than . the regulation quantity of spice
and that matters at Â¦ St. Lou is . and, else
where will be handled without gloves. :
.* Remarks that were decidedly. â¢ gin
gery have been reported as ma'de by
the California commissioners. The
State Mineralogist is 'also reported 'to
have expressed his mind very-. freely
about the commissioners. Some echoes
of .the conflict, of authority have been
heard in the mining counties of this
State. Certain â¢ newspapers . have pubr
lishe'd stories that added fuel: to . the
flames. Aubury's friends at this end
of the line have hinted that. such pubr
lications ,were inspired by his enemies.
Lewis , E. . Aubury, State Mineralogist
of California, is back from St. Louis.
He. has left the California, mineral ex
