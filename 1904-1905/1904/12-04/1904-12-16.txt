BOSTON. Dec 16.â Colonel William
C Greene, president of the Greene Con

been hurlinc defiance at Thomas" W.
LaÂ»-son for three days, declaring that
be would visit him and call him such
pet names as "liar, faker, charlatan and
robber of widows and orphans," ar
rived In Boston at 9 o'clock to-night
and is now at the Touraine. It is prob
able that he will see Lawson some time
to-rnorrow. T â¢
Colonel Greene came into town quiet
ly, without any revolvers or bowle
knives In his boots, and went to the
Somerset, where he had a conference
with Charles Hayden of Hayden, Stone
& Co., brokers of the Greene company
in Boston. From the Somerset Club he
went to the Touraine, and after loiter
ing about the hotel lobby lot a half
hour went to bed, giving: orders that he
should on no account be disturbed.
There will be lively times In the fin
ancial district when it Is known that
the doughty colonel has arrived at last.
Lawson to-night issued another cir
cular embracing one of his character
istic denunciations of Rockefeller and
others of the Standard OH party.
NEW YORK, Dec. 15.â Advices from
Boston say Colonel W. C. Greene, pres
ident of the Greene Consolidated Cop

promptly sent word to Lawson that he
wished to see him to-morrow, but in
an interview Greene's words were any
thing but warlike.
"Personally I have no fault to find

In the will of General Harrison pro

deal with a New York clique to ruin
thousands of- stockholders for his own
benefit. But this talk of a fight be
tween us is nonsense."
Lawson's expected attack on his se
lected list of properties did not mate
rialize in Wall street to-day, and Law
son himself informed his friends, and
his enemies as well, that they had been
deceived in Reports circulated on
Wednesday by some Wall street bears.
He gleefully stated, however, that he
would have more to say later.
Apparently the only other communi
cations sent out by the Boston operator
were various little taunts directed to
Colonel Greene, urging: him to make
his promised visit.
Meanwhile James W. Goodman, who
threatened Greene with a pistol, lan
guishes in jail.
The suit of James W. Goodman, a
Westerner, against Colonel William C.
Greene and Willis P. Harlow for an ac
counting in the transfer by Goodman
to them of rights to 100,000 shares of
the Yaqui Copper Company, said to be
worth $1,000,000, was stricken from the
calendar of the Supreme Court to-day.
The court held that no partnership had
been shown between Colonel Greene
and Harlow and that Harlow had not
been served with papers. Goodman
contended that Colonel Greene had re
tained Goodman's .interest in the cop
per company.
Goodman was arrested last night on
complaint that he contemplated harm
to Colonel Greene. He had once before
been arrested on complaint of threat
ening Colonel Greene's life.

than they had cost him.
Russell B. Harrison and his sister,
being interested in the residuary es
tate, objected to the placing of the se
curities at their cost in the widow's
fund, and contended that they should
have been listed at their value. They
showed the court that the trust fund.
Instead of being $125,000. was really
$140,000, and asked that the court order
the $15,000 Increase to be placed in the
residuary estate.
Judge Allen held to-day that the
trust company had acted in accordance
with the provisions of the will, and that
the securities should go into the" fund
at their cost to Mr. Harrison, regard
less of what they may be worth on
the market now.

demanding that powers be given for

NEW YORK, Dec. 15.â At the conclu
sion of the examination of Mrs. Young,
widow . of Caesar Young, who was

Patterson's sister, Julia Smith. Again
in the afternoon she was recalled and

she searched his pockets and was cer
tain that , he had no revolver. She as
serted that he never carried a revolver.

OFFICIAL AX IS HANGING
OVER HIGGINS' HEAD
Hutton Prepares to Break Patrolman From North End Station
Bribery and corruption of officers in the. red light district will-be made public in investigation of the con
duct of Policeman Samuel Higgins before the Police Commission. Hutton and Dean will offer evidence to prove
that Higgins received bribes from the fallen women of Bacon; place. Unless those -who actually handed over the
coin can be induced to testify, the accused bluecoat may escape-prosecution, but his dismissal is almost certain.
M I ' have nothing f to say regarding
this matter at this . time, though 1
may have some information for the
public soon. As to whether I shall
demand an Investigation of police
methods in the district -. occupied by
fallen women, I cannot say, nor can I
say whether or not; I will present the
facts, so far as' I have gathered them,
to the. Grand' Jury j_f or Its action. As
to ray views of the case I have nothing
to say at tills time."â -Police Commis
sioner H. W. Hutton.
"I know, nothing:; officially of Police
Commissioner I Iu turn's attempt to
prove that police officers are bribed In
the tenderloin. I; chance the details
constantly to prevent corruption, but
I cannot help it if bad men get into
the department. - .My record shows
that every â  man caught crafting: re
ceives the niost severe punishment."â
Chief of Police ,Wittman's statement.
"I am not at liberty to say Just what
took place in ] Bacon place Tuesday
night. If the investigation said to be
projected takes place I â¢ will be able
to show that -I have acted only as an
honorable man should. As far as the
charges against Illsrclns are concerned,
I have nothing to 'say. I am not a spy,
as is claimed."â- Patrolman John Dean.
Patrolman Samuel Higgins will
probably be dismissed from the force
as a result of 'Police Commissioner
Hutton's visit to Bacon place on .last
Tuesday nights The. accused police
man is likely to escape criminal prose

; It v is expected, however, that: the
projected investigation before the Po
lice Commisfsion will bring to light. the
fact that the city's uniformed ser
vants who guard the peace of the den
izens of the half- world are regularly
in receipt, of bribes. No one seems to
have a scintilla of evidence â¢' that any
of this red light corruption fund ever
passed from the patrolmen's pockets
to thoso of men. higher in the depart
ment.
The Chief and. his captains are tak
ing every precaution to prevent brib
ery, and it will go hard with any man
caught doing underhand work. ., Alex
ander, Snowball, Hammill and Reade
have all had opportunities to discover
what.it meant to be apprehended
soliciting or: accepting bribes. It seems,
however, not in any way contrary to
the ethics of. the rank and file to graft
in misdemeanor cases, particularly
where gambling, prostitution and vio
lations of saloon' ordinances are in
volved.
SOME HEAVY TAXES.
Bacon place Is said to contribute $300
a week. Belden place escapes with a
tax of $500 a month. The saloons on
the Barbary Coast are alleged to pay
from $10 to $25 weekly that the pro
prietors may not be compelled to stop
music after 1 o'clock and that side
doors and curtains may not be dis
turbed. Ordinarily there is no effort
made to conceal the briberies, but when
an. investigation is on the tapis the in
terested parties remain quiet out of
self-defense. The whole department
appears to be Incensed at the acts of
Hutton, "Special- Chief of Police for
1129 Dupont street." The police say
he is trying to make capital for him
self out of his private detective work.
He declines to talk about his visit to
Bacon place and he has retained what
ever corruption funds he gathered so
far as is known. None of the other
members ; of the Police Commission
have been taken into Hutton's confi
dence, so the whole world waits .on
his nod. â¢
Policeman ; John, Dean of the Park
station is the principal witness against
Higgins. The two men went on duty
in Bacon place Tuesday afternoon at
3 o'clock. The fallen women were not
compelled to pay tribute until nightfall.
Marked coin was - placed in the hands
of those who were to aid Hutton in
springing his trap. Dean is alleged to
have , been in complete knowledge of
the prospective visit of the Police Com
missioner. Knowing by â¢ prearrange
ment what was about to occur he re
ceived the toll and is said to. have seen
Higgins get: his share in turn. s , .
When | Hutton appeared both men
were directed to, show what money they
had in their pockets. As Dean was in
on the gajne his funds were brought to
light : Immediately, but Higgins was in
another boat. He. resolutely declared
that whatever money he possessed was
his own, and declined to surrender the
whole or any part of it to his superior
officer. ... â  - "â¢â .*";'Â«:>â¢â

Higgins says for* publication that he
is guiltless of .wrong, that he never saw
Hutton Tuesday night, that Dean never
saw ' him do anything unbecoming, to a
policeman of this good and great mu
nicipality and that the whole story is a
lie. Higgins says also that he supposes
the board can;, break him * if - the Com
missioners. want to, but that they can
never prove he took a dollar from the

Xaval Lieutenant Heroically
Rescues the Survivors
From the Death Trap
PHILADELPHIA, . Dec 15.â Caught
in a trap and helpless to save them
selves, three men lost their lives and
lour others, including Lieutenant Wil
liam -C. Cole, were terrible scalded to
day by a rush of steam and boding
water in the fire room of the battle-
Ehip Massachusetts, lying â  at the
League Island navy yard. The dead:
â¢EDWARD BUB, married; boilermak
er and civilian.
ANDREW HAMILTON, married;
boilermaker and civilian.
CHARLES RITZEL, boilermaker and
civilian.
The injured: Lieutenant William C.
Cole, U. S. NT., assistant chief engineer
of the Massachusetts, scalded about
the head and back; William Anderson,
chip's boiiermaker, badly scalded:
James Wilson, boilermaker helper and
civilian employe, scalded; Joseph A.
Duran. boilermaker helper and civilian,
tcalded.
With the exception of Lieutenant
Cole all of the killed and injured re
eide in Philadelphia. Lieutenant Cole
received his injuries in a heroic effort
to rescue the others.
The accident was caused by the giv
ing way of a gasket or rubber washer
on a boiler on the starboard side of
the ship. The Massachusetts has
b^en at the navy yard for some time
undergoing extensive repairs, particu
larly to the boilers and machinery. The
boiler on which the accident occurred
ha 3 recently been cleaned and
thoroughly tested, and the Boilermakers
â¢were to-day at. work on another boil
er. Without warning, the gasket be
tween the boiler plate and the boiler
head gave way and a terrific rush of
pteara and hot water occurred. The
doors of the fire room were closed at
the time and the only avenue of escape
â¢was a safety ladder. Only one man,
Bramlet, a ship's fireman, thought of
the ladder and he escaped without a
â¢car.
Few on the upper decks knew what
had occurred until the steam came
rushing up from the seething pit be
low. The work of rescue was prompt
p.rd to this promptness those who
escaped death owe their thanks. The
first to enter the firehole was Lieu
tenant Cole. Without hesitating,
though Fcalded by Ihe hot water, he
dragged the men from the place to the
d. or, where they were taken in charge
by others. Bub and Hamilton were
dr-ad when found and Ritzel died a few
minutes after being taken on deck.
PROHIBITIOXISTS DEMAND
RESIGNATION* OF STEWART
Chairman Is Deemed a Necessary
Sacrifice to Party Harmony by
Executive Committee. .' .â¢ â 
CHICAGO, Dec. 15. â After an all
day session of the Prohibition Nation
al Executive Comimttee, where heat
ed debate varied from personal invec
tive and vilification of motive to a de
mand for prayer for guidance. Nation
al Chairman Oliver W. Stewart of
Chicago was at midnight â¢ deemed a
necessary sacrifice to party harmony
and his resignation was practically
demanded by a vote of 24 to 20 of the
members of the national committee.
Immediately following the passage
of the Stewart resolution came a ceri
eure resolution of William E. John
eor., managing editor of the New
Voice, the official organ of the party,
condemning him for "reprehensible
condurt" in aiding the defeat of Stew
art for the Legislature. Then the fac
tion opposed to Stewart sprung an
other resolution calling for the im
mediate resignation of National' Sec
retary Tate. This resolution was ta-
Med under adjournment and will be
made the basis of a fight at to-mor
row's meeting.

BATTLESHIP SEVASTOPOL
DISABLED AND JAPANESE
TORPEDO-BOAT MISSING
FIERCE NA VAL FIGHT
Small War Vessel
and Crew Dis
appear.
TOKIO, Dec. 15.â The turretshlp
Sevastopol is still afloat, but is ap
parently damaged.
The partially successful torpedo at
tsck on the Sevastopol was made in
the: face of almost insurmountable ob
stacles and writes another inspiring
story of the splendid bravery of a
number of officers. The entire crews
of the torpedo-boat destroyers and tor
pedo-boats volunteered for the task,
courting death In their efforts to de
stroy the only floating Russian battle
ship at Port Arthur. :: â¢
Facing a. driving snowstorm and
heavy seas, the flotillas separated and
under individual commanders the ves
sels , attacked independently. The
decks of the destroyers and torpedo
boats were â  coated with ice and the
men suffered acutely from the cold.
The Russians resorted to the most
extreme precautions to protect the
Sevastopol. They dropped nets, which
shielded the bows of the warship, and
the Sevastopol was further protected
by an especially constructed wooden
boom, the framework of which was
composed of iron-bound logs and
cables arid heavy chains, interlaced
and entangled. \ From the surface of
this boom hung a deep curtain made
of torpedo nets, taken from the sunken
battleships, the purpose of which was
to catch and destroy the' torpedoes and
their mechanism.
The Japanese probably refrained
from attempting to cut or jump the
boom, but the torpedo-boats and de
stroyers evidently forced the openings,
which the Russians had left to allow
communication with th% harbor.
The commander of the Japanese
third squadron, reporting at 10:35
o'clock yesterday morning, said: â 
CGimtiMK-ing at 11:30 o'clock on Tuesday
night and continuing until 8 o'clock on Wed
nesday morning, six torpedo- boats and espe
cially fittÂ«d torpedo craft constantly "made at
tacks against â  the Russian battleship Sevasto
pol. tnÂ« coast-defense vessel Otvashnl and the
military transports. ' â¢ â 
Details of the attacks are not yet known.
However, according to reports received from
the tratch tower at 9 o'clock this morning the
Sevastopol had commenced lowering astern, and
the water Â«as Mid to haVe reached the torpedo
tubes astern.
The same commander, telegraphing
last night, said: â¢ . ,
At 3:30 o'clock on the morning of December
14 < Wednesday). Commander Otaki, leading a
flotilla of torpedo-boat*, and Lieutenant Miya
moto, leading another flotilla, began attack*
against the Sevastopol and the transports.
Otaki's flotilla failed to accomplish Its pur
pose, owing to the severe snowstorm.
Miyamoto's flotilla succeeded in reaching the
Intended spot by taking advantage of the fact
that the enemy's searchlights were exposing
Otaki'Â« flotilla, and were not directed against
Miyamoto's. In the thick o? the snow, while
Miyamoto's flotilla was aearchlng for the en
emy's ships, one torpedo-boat became lost tfom
its comrade fht;Â».
At 4 o'clock Lieutenant Xakamuda'e torpedo-,
boat independently-attacked a 'military' trans
port Another torpedo-boat under Miyamoto
discharged and exploded a torpedo against the
Sevastopol. Both returned safely, but failed
to meet the missing torpedo-boat.
Lieutenant Xapata, commanding this boat,
has not returned, and there is anxiety for the
safety of the boat and crew.
TÂ»-"day the watch-tower guardshlp reports
that the stern of the Sevastopol appears to have
lowered three feet. ":V -â¢/ "i

TOKIO, Dec. 15.-7-The Japanese are

ment to purchase warships; from the
Governments of Argentina and Chile.
In response to a diplomatic inquiry

There is a growing feeling of resent

the question to-day an official said
that, in the event of Chile selling war
ships to. Russia, Japan would unques
tionably take the first opportunity to

REPORTS CRUISER ASHORE.
Steamship Captain Alleges Disaster to
Japanese Vessel.
CHEFU, Dec. 15. â Captain Hansen
of the German- steamship-- Tsingtau
reports that on -December 14 he saw
a Japanese cruiser apparently ashore
in Yungching Bay, ten. miles south of
the Shantung Promontory, and that
a large merchantman was seemingly
giving assistance to, the. warship.
Telegrams sent to Weihaiwei and
Tsingtau brought forth; no confirma
tion of Captain Hansen*s story. In a
reply received from .Weihaiwei it was
explained that warships sometimes
coal in Tungching Bay from colliers
and this is generally accepted as the
explanation of what Captain Hansen

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY, DECEMBER \1\\ 1904
Wounded Russians
Are Praised for
Heroism.
MUKDEN, Tuesday, Dec. 13.â An in
teresting army order has been issued
calling attention to the .exceptional
heroism, self-sacrifice and devotion of
two comrades, wounded infantrymen,
Harzamatoff and Ischenko, who, with
a dozen other wounded men lay for
forty-four days in abandoned trenches
between the Russian and Japanese
lines, suffering from the bitter cold and
lack of food. Harzamatoff, who was
only slightly wounded,, assisted the
others into the trenches, took coats
from the dead to cover them, bound
their wounds and dug a well. Japanese
came and took away the coats and
filled in the well. Harzamatoff again
got ' the coats, reopened the well and
obtained a little dry bread and rice
from dead Russians and Japanese. The
men also were compelled to eat raw
millet. " "'â¢â "â¢,,;, â  '
Japanese made several visits to. the
trenches, but paid no attention to the
wounded and rendered no assistance.
The Russians feiegned death, fearing
to fall into the hands of the Japanese.
The sufferers frequently attempted to
crawl back to the Russian lines, but
were compelled by weakness and the
pain of their wounds, as â¢ well as the
steady firing, to abandon each attempt.
Finally, when only three men were
left alive, three Japanese came, one of
whom accidentally stepped on the leg
of a soldier, who groaned aloud from
pain. Finding him alive the Japanese
dragged him away from his â¢ comrades,
who were too weak to help him, de
spite his despairing entreaties. One
of the Japanese kicked Ischkenb in the
side, but left him for dead.
Harzamatoff and Ischkeno finally re
solved to rrfake a last desperate effort
the next- night to creep back to the
Russian lines, which were 400 paces
distant. After dragging their bodies
slowly and painfully a portion of the
distance they were observed by a Rus
sian sentinel and met with volleys from
Russian rifles, forcing them to lie still
in the millet until the firing ceased,
when they finally succeeded in reaching
the lines. They were cared for, fed
and Bent to a hospital train.
The army order paints the - sublime
heroism and modesty of these two men
in , glowing colors, especially that of
Harzamatoff, who, being but slightly
wounded, could have Joined the Rus
sian troops sooner, but prererred to re
main with his comrades-
"His regiment," the order says,
"should be proud to have such a man
in its ranks."

- It is also said that the patrolman oc
cupied a similar confidential position
with. the Southern Pacific Railroad bu
fore joining the police force. Dean
served three years in the Eighteenth j
Infantry in the Philippines. He denies!
in vigorous terms the allegation that he I
ever acted as a spy for any corpora
tion. His. superiors on the force say he
has apparently been a model officer
since his appointment last October.
Chief of Police Wittman disclaimed*
all knowledge of bribery In the tender- s
loin. "Show me the men," he said.!
"and I will get the evidence to convict !
them. My record shows that whenever
I learn of bribery, in ' this department
the guilty have to suffer. I cannot

patrolman or other officer in this de
partment guilty of any infringement of I
laws or rules, I stand ready to assist !
him in gathering evidence." â¢ J
' ' AVITTMAX'S POSITION.
Chief Wittman has done all in his
power to prevent any sueh'eorruption
of officers as Is* charged. At Bacon
place the detail is changed every day.
The beats in the tenderloin- are also
changed' as frequently as is consistent
with good work. Particular attention
is paid to the -habits and finances of }
men who do duty in sections of the city |
where temptations are placed in the
way of. patrolmen. When, a man is sus
pected of taking bribes he is trans- |
ferredvto the "fog belt" if convicting â 
â¢evidence, is lacking.
iThe~^Pj&llce Commission will meet
â this rafte'rnotm to discuss the question
â of- corruption in Chinatown, and it is
i expected that Hutton will at that time
make, known the facts in regard to his
descent upon Bacon place. â¢ *

GRAND JURY
PLANS WORK
Inquisitorial * Body Gives
Evidence of Intention to
Probe Corruption Reports
ADOPTS A KESOLUTION

ment Is Made and Commit
tees Are Appointed to Act
The first meeting of the new. Grand
Jury brought out the attitude of that
body toward graff and stories of eraft
in municipal . offices. The members
, voiced their sentiments plainly, show
ing their determination to go to the
1 bottom of the scandal of levies on earn*
bling and-extortion from fallen women.
There will be-no ineffectual
tions if the new. body carries out its
declared Intentions.
The Grand Jury met at 2 o'clock
yesterday afternoon and the follow
ing resolution was adopted by the
uranimous vote of the seventeen
'members present: i. .;';,
Whereas. It is common talk among: the
public and openly charged- in the daily"press
that certain officials and certain departments
of our city government are. not properly con
ducted; and Â»... . . . ., â¢ ' . - Â«â 
Whereas, It is the first duty of 'the Grand
JUiry, without fear, bias or prejudice, to Bift
and investigate such matters; be.lt therefore
Resolved, .ThatUhls, Grand Jury recommends,
advises and instructs Its foreman to arrange
for such experts as may be necessary and that
the various committees of this Grand Jury b%
ordered to make â  a most â  thorough; searching
and rigid Investigation into the conduct of
such officials and sucb departments as they
may deem proper. . .
AIM* AT THE POLICJE. -1"
The "certain officials and certain- de
partments" is the blanket form used to
provide for future contingencies. Just
now .the -Police Department is that
which concerns the jurors.
The process server is to begin work
this morning. Foreman Andrews has a
very businesslike manner of going at
things; and if a fair amount of unanim
ity prevails among the jurors in prob
i'ing $5-per-table collections where fan
tan -has flourished in Chinatown and in
exposing the graft in the tenderloin
districts there may be a shaking up in
the affairs of the municipality that
only the drastic powers of a Grand
Jury could bring about.
The first indictment returned by the
new jurv was against Abe Schwartz,
who is accused of embezzling $12,000
from the Phoenix Savings and Loan
Association. He has recently been ap
prehended in the City of Mexico, and
indictment was hastened In order to in
stitute the extradition proceedings at
once. There are several charges against
him. â â .-...

Pittsburg Men Will Pay Heavily to
Save Their Reputations. '
ONE BANKER .OUT HALF MILLION DOLLARS
PITTSBURG, Dec 15.â The Chadwlck
stnsation has only fairly begun in
PJttsburg, according to financial au
thorities.
The $500,000 note issued by Mrs. Cas
sle I* Chadwlck one year ago has been
located here, but it Is the general belief
that it will not be brought to light if
the Pittsburgers can help it, as It
would give their reputations as finan
ciers a heavy blow. . -- 'â 
The note in question was given to a
bank in a neighboring city. It is due
en January 7, 1905. Until it Is due and
the borrower has defaulted payment
the subject of the paper is pot a priv
ileged communication. If the nego
tiators and the directors of the bank
are willing to pocket the loss by mak
ing the amount good it will be utterly
squelched. This is what will be done
unless the Federal authorities subpena
the bank o2iccrs and compel them to
testify against the woman.
The officials are wealthy enough to
pay the note and it is said they have
made provision to do so and thus stifle
publicity. Had the slip not occurred
by which James W. Friend's name be
came known in connection with the
transaction it might never have been
known who loaned Mrs. Chadwick the
money here.
BECKWITH VISITS CELIi.
CLEVELAND. Dec 15.â Mrs. Chad
wick's first day In the County Jail was
a busy one for her. She received sev
eral visits from her attorneys, held
long conferences with them, conversed
v.ith newspaper men and for fifteen
minutes stood face to face with Presi
dent Beckwith of the Oberlin Bank,
who has come to such great trouble
through his financial transactions with
her.
The meeting was dramatic. The
aped banker, who had for hours been
before the county Grand Jury, went to
"the office of Sheriff Barry this after
noon and asked if he might see Mrs.
Chadwick. The Sheriff readily con
sented and Mrs. Chadwlck was eager
*<Â» meet him. Accompanied by Mrs.
Beckwith, who, owing to her husband's
ill health, is always by his side, the
aped banker made his way slowly and
feebly up the long flights of Btairs lead
ing to Mrs. Chadwick's cell. She met
him at the entrance of the corridor
snd shook hands â¢with him cordially.
After some general conversation Beck
with referred to their business rela
tions by saying:
' "Mrs. Chadwick, you have ruined
ir.e, but I'm not bo sure yet you are
a fraud. I have stood by you to my
last dollar and I do think now that
the time has come for you to make
known everything in relation to this
thing-" - â¢ '-â ';

WOMAN" IGNORES APPEAI/.
Mrs. Chadwlck did not reply directly
to the words of Beckwith, but her
manner and the look on her face were
not conciliatory. Seeing that she
would not answer Beckwith went on:
"I have always told you that I did
not like it because you changed your
lawyers so often. Why don't you get
a good one and stick to him?"
"Well," said Mrs. Chadwlck, "I have
reasons for that."
"Have you heard from Judge Olcott
recently?" was Beckwith's next ques

"Not since I left New York," was
Mrs. Cha&wick's reply.
"Has he changed his mind?"
"No; he has the same belief that he
always held."
To what matter the Questions referred
was not known.
Mr. and Mrs. Beckwith both then said
they hoped the tangles connected with

thanked them for calling, shook hands
with Mr. and Mr?^ Beckwith and said
she would be pleated to have them call
again.
CLUBMAN LOSES
ALIMONY SUIT
Chicago Judge Holds That
Millionaire 3Iust Pay His
Former Wife $33,301
CHICAGO. Dec. 13.â George F. Hard-
Ing, Chicago millionaire and clubman,
has lost his contest over the payment
of $300 a month alimony to his wife,
Mrs. Adelaide M. Harding, and in an
opinion given to-day Judge Gibbons
found Harding not only responsible for
future payments, but In contempt of
court for arrearages to the amount
of $33,201. This amount Harding must
pay within ten days or he will be
lodged in the County Jail, according to
the decree.
After a bitter 'contest and .an appeal
to the Supreme Court, Harding brought
suit for an absolute divorce in San
Diego, CaL, charging desertion. He
was granted the decree originally, the
decision being sustained by the Su
preme Court of Calif ornia.
In a decision here to-day, however.
Judge Gibbons holds that the separate
maintenance decree of the Cook Coun
ty court is still binding upon the real
estate man, notwithstanding the di
vorce granted by the San Diego court.
Judge Gibbons* says:
It la claimed by Harding- that the decree of
divorce granted by the Superior Court of San
Diego County and affirmed by the Supreme
Court of that State absolutely severed the rela
tions of a man and wife between himself and
Mrs. Harding, and that under the Federal con
stitution this court Is bound to give the same
force and effect to said decree as If the derree
had been rendered by the Circuit Court of the
State of Illinois.
Had the cult in California been for the re
covery of money or property the contention
would probably be substantially correct, but
the California decreÂ« cannot abrogate the Cir
cuit Court decree here of separate mainten
ance.

her daughter in marriage. She refused,
and he asked to speak to the girl for
a few'minutes. He then pulled the girl
up on the horse behind his. saddle and
made for the mountains. A number

While Mr. Fisher, who has had charxa
of our big sale In closing out the Weber
line of pianos, has finished his thirty-
day contract with us, and which prac-
tically closed the big sale at 11 o'clock
Wednesday night, we do not wish It
understood that we have raised the
prices, or gone from cost back up to
retail prices again, on any of the re-
maining unsold pianos of the Weber
line', for we have not; we are still sell-
Ing at. and here offer to any individual
buyer, any unsold piano yet in our
wareroom coming" from the "Weber
Concern" (Weber, Wheelock or Stuyve-
sant). for just what it .will stand to
cost us in the house of the buyer.
This is more than fairâ for no dealer
can make a living selling pianos prac-
tically at cost, or without a profit, but
as Is well known, and frankly hereto-
fore stated, we no longer control tha
agency for the above well-known makes
of pianos, and that we made, and Just
closed an "all cash" sale on the full
Weber line for the purpose of getting
our money back, and the Instruments
out of the way of our new line of
pianos, now on the way to take tha
place of the Weber agency.
More than one hundred pianos were
sold during the sale, nearly all for spot
cash. During the latter few days of the
sale, buyers had the option of paying
all cash, or buying on payments, at the
"closing out sale cash pricas," by pay-
Ing 8 per cent interest on deferred pay-
ments. Not the raise of a cent has been
added to the price, nor will there be
during the next ten days, on any piano
now on sale in our wareroom: for we
have some twenty or more very fine
.new pianos of high class which we feel
obliged to dispose of before the 1st, for
â¢two good reasons.
First, our friendly competitor who
will in the future represent the "Web-
er" line, will be receiving these same
makes of pianos into his wareroom. and)
we don't wish to^then, or thereafter,
be offering Weber, Wheelock, or Stuy-
vesant pianos at cost, or any unusual
sacrifice price which might Interfere
with his regular retail prices of any
of these makes.
And, the second reason is. that our
own new line of pianos which are to
take the place of the "Weber," are on
the way in large quantities, and we
want not a single piano (no matter
what brand, or how fine) of our past
alliances, in our wareroom, or in the
way to be crowded back by those we
shall advertise and push in the future.
Therefore we positively cannot afford
to risk for the sake of a profit of any
kind, having either or any of these
pianos on hand, and unsold a moment
longer than they can be put back Into
our safe in cash, or good customers'
paper.
There are a few choice and costly
Webers to offer to-day (from $163
to $260 below their regular retail prices
everywhere) on terms of $30 down, and
$15 per month. And all others no mat-
ter what style, price, or make, shall go
at $25 down, and $10 per month.
Every piano we now have In stock,
and for sale. Is brand new (except
two very old uprights), and the factory
guarantee will accompany each.
We feel positive that no one who Is in
the market for a first-class piano, can
in Justice to himself afford to let this
chance pass â this deal close â the Weber
get away from him, when It will, in
this Instance, take but the price of a
common piano to dwn one.
We have one special bargain to offer
to-day in the way of a high-class fac-
tory sample piano, which can be had
considerably below its factory price as
billed to us. If not sold within the next
three days. It will be returned to the
factory that shipped it as a sample.
This piano is one of the finest that's
made, and can be bought within eight
dollars of half its regular price. Terms
to suit the buyer. Now don't put It off. .
please. We've got the bargains for you.

The Rev. Father Alexander P. Doyle,
president of the Apostolic Missionary
College, Washington, p. C, preached
the sermon and Archbishop Riordan
extended his felicitations to the Sisters
of Mercy.
Father Doyle in his sermon said:
A DAY OF REJOICING.
"And the people were joyful in the sight
of the sanctuary." â Judith xvi:24.
"For the Lord made them joyful with a
great joy. their wives' and their children re
joiced. And the joy cf Jerusalem was beard
afar off." â Eedras 11:12-42.
There is a epecial fitness in the people of
this city by the Western sea. Irrespective of
crettd cr racial affiliation, gathering together
today to celebrate the golden Jubilee ef the
ccxaing of the Sisters of Mercy among them.
It is not well for any " people to forget its
Â«nrly beginning*; particularly is this true when
their Â«arly year* were marked by courageous
sacrifice* end. heroic endeavors. And it is
good for the children of this generation to
gt> back in spirit to the days of the noble men
who laid the foundation of San Francisco's
greatness and remember their struggles and
try to appreciate the arduous labors they
went through in order that we may enjoy
the blessings of a rit*r civilization.
Heroism is always attractive and worthy
of the largest measure of praise. There Is
nothing that draws from our hearts the fullest
cted of admiration" like the working out of
noble purposes at the com of human sacrifices
and even to the shedding of human blood.
Viewed In this light the history -of the colo
nization of the Pacific slop? is a hittory of
â¢which any people may well be proud.' The
great movement that led to the peopling of
C&llforr.la by the hardy pioneer of forty-nin*
and -the < arly fifties ia one of the most mem
orable events in the development of our coun
try, and the men who took part in that mi
gration were made up of as sturdy a fiber,
both morally and physically, as ever laid
thf foundation of any country's greatness.
If we s*t aside for the moment the re
ligious coition Jt Is true that the dominant
motive of the treking of the Argonauts was
the 6*arch for the golden fleece, yet neverthe
less they were giants In thoeÂ« days and It
was a gigantic purpose that nerved the race
of strong men and women to leave behind the
remforts of homer In the East and the re
finements of settled civilization and to face
the <Su*ty. dangerous pathways of the weary
prairie, with scanty feed arid plentiful peril,
and to kÂ«Â»ep It up with stout hearts for months
ur.til the vision of. the Golden Gate met their
gaze. And we children of that older gen
eration may well be proud of the fact that
ve ar* ' desr^nded from the loins of a race
of men who were built on a heroic mold.
One of the strongest claims this dear old city
of ours has to our affection ia that its be
ginnings were laid by the strong arms and
the'Btout hearts of the nob!m race of people
that ever blessed this country of oar*.
POWER OF RELIGION'.
Ttere way he found tne scoffer, who will
fail to appreciate the mighty work of the
Argonauts, who will apeak of lawieFane*a and
licentiousness of the <arly <SayÂ« and thereby
make it appear that the coming of the first
settlers was the lr.rush!ng of a mob trampling
to the earth the weak and the. helpless in lte

eager, avarice for gold and leaving- behind
them all respect for law and morality, but In :
their ignorance of early conditions they have i
not known the love of Justice and right and
the desire to organise a stable, conservative
commonwealth that dominated the hearts of
the majority of this community In the. early
days. . Â»
While we praise the men aid women whose
heroic virtues, personal bravery and ceaseless I
toil handed down to us all â  that we enjoy
of civic blessing, there Is .another class. -of
heroes among us whose motives were not tjie'
search for gold and yet whose coming whs
an event of no little importance in- the. his
tory of our city. It Is the golden " Jubilee â  of
this event that we are gathered 'here* to cele-"
orate to-day. No commonwealth can hope to
attain any stable organization nor can-it rise
to '.any moral greatness without the*'element
of religion. Religion Is the basis "Of* nil
respect for law. it is the cement that'. blnds ;
together the various elements of 'the â¢social
frbric. '/â Â£-" â  ' i -
â  It was a strange sight that met the'eyes of
the sturdy pioneer this day fifty years ago,
when there stepped ashore the little, band Of
consecrated women who haa left their, distant'
hemes In the old land In order to devote,thelr
lives to tha service of the poor and '..the sick
and the sinful in the land of their adoption. â 
, EARLY MISSIONARY HEROES.'
It is true, that this Western world has had
Its religious heroes in the person of -.the .early
missionaries, who brought the knowledge' of
Christ to the Indians, and had bulH r up 'that
â¢wonderful chain of missions from San' Diego
te the Mission Dolores, but the avaricious hand
of the despciler had done Its full work of de
struction and at the time of the coming of
these new religious workers the missions, had
become but a thing of historical record. An
other race of people with entirely different
Ideals occupied the nelds sanctified by the Pa
dres, and -the social conditions that had been
created by the Influx of the sturdy men from
all parts of the world knew little of the uplift
ing sweetness of a woman's influence and less"
of the cultured refinements of a well i estab
lished home. There was something of . the
scramble for the first places and the desire to
make a fortune in the quickest way that for
the time being obscured the higher and better
living.
The Sisters came Into the unpaved streets of
an unformed frontier town, and Jnto a com
munity of hardy pioneers and Into an atmos
phere of unsettled social conditions, and their
coming was as the visitation from the world of
angels. The natural chivalry of strong men's
hearts received them with open arms because
they came not. for gold of the earth, but for
the alleviation of human misery and the kal
vatlcn of souls. They brought with them not
the desire to accumulate wealth, but the pur
pose to dispense with a lavish hand heaven's
own treasure. It does not take : the shrewd
men ef the world long to discern the higher
things of life and living In an environment
where It was every one's duty, to look out for
the main chax.ee; the pioneers were keenly ap
preciative of the higher motives that Inspired
the coming of the Sisters and from the very
beginning they give them a royal welcome.
Who were these Sisters of Mercy?
DAUGHTERS OF THE PEOPLE.
They were the daughters of the people In
closest touch with the diocesan and parochial
authorities. At the throngs of emigrants
sailed away from .poor, unhappy Ireland be-
Caufwi the alternative was placed before them
either of a lifetime of- starvation and * misery
In therr own land., or to seek the necessities cf
adequate living In the. land of the stranger
they were not forsaken by their spiritual lead
ers. God raised up n. ! valiant womanâCath
erine MeAuleyâ who gathered into religion the
choicest and the best of the young women of
the land and consecrated them under the veils
of a devoted life, and Â»he sent them with the
people as they railed away, so that in their
moments of weakness and despair there might
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 16, .1904.
be consecrated hands to alleviate their misery.
In the wandering of the emigrant In a strange
land some would of a necessity fall by the
wayside. There was need then of the-conse
crated nun, who' would stand by the sick In the
fe\ ? ered hospital warda to raise the cooling
draught to the parched lips of the dying, to
wipe away the cold mists of death and to
speak the cheering word of salvation that the
doors of the better life may be opened to
them. I
So. when Father Hugh Gallagher presented
himself at the chapel c* the Convent of Kin
sale and asked for volunteers to come with
him to far off California to carry out the
great mission of mercy on the Pacific Slope
he found a ready response. Almost the entire
community offered themselves. A few were
selected, and at their head was placed the
youngest. Mother Baptist Russel, a woman of
â¢xtraordinary gifts of mind and heart. The
special providences of God safeguarded them
in their journeyings. An apparent accident
kept them from calling on the Ill-fated Arctic.
Thpy landed In New York.. They were cheered
, in a special way by our own saintly founder,
Father Hecker. He bade them godnpeed.
Again they started out to. croes the, isthmus,
and so they came to San Francisco.'
. FOUND PLENTY OF ' WORK.
s When- (they came they found plenty of work
i -to do. The exigencies of life In the raw ana
unformed city opened a large field of useful
ness to the consecrated social worker. In the
I rush 'of life there was little time to care for
j the weak and the dependent classes. Thero
I .were few if any hospitals for the sick; The
Ignorant had tb be instructed in Christian doc
trine, and the waifs had to be gathered up
Into- protecting asylums. Right royally did
they go to work and right earnestly did they
keep it *ud. in reason and out of season, for
these fifty years. i .
; It Js ,. not j jny duty to-day . to tell of their
trials and their triumphs, of their heroic work
for the tick* In the hoBuital and for children
in the schools. It is not mine to rollow them
Into the jloathsome. dwelling of. degraded â¢ mis
ery -and" to see them brighten up by their
presence, the dark places of destitution, like the
incoming. of a gleam of sunshine. It U not
mine to go with them into the barred dun
gebn where the condemned criminal Is segre
gated from Ma race, forsaken by friends,
fÂ»corned by society and plunged Into despair,
and bear them tell how the Savior of the
world died as a criminal and an outcast from
society and that it Is needful to have gooa
cheer, to look beyond the grave for that
glorious resurrection when this poor body,
though it be sown in corruption, will rise in
:lnc6rruptlon. though it be eown in dishonor
win rise In glory, and though sown In weak
ness will rise In power that It may walk and
wear not, that It may run and faint not. â 
-It is not mine to tell how they gathered
about them the Door waifs of humanity and
instilled into their young minds the love of
God. and tenderly and carefully entwined the
tendrils of , -their heart about the great prin
ciples of morality. Nor is It mine to tell how
the weary hours were spent at the bedside of
thff sick in the hospital on the hill, and how
when the cholera broke out and the smallpox
was a plague It was the white angel of mercy
that hovered about the sick bed. ; Over and
over again they volunteered for this service in
the smallpox hospital when the plague-stricken
people were carried to their graves by hun
dreds. It is not mine to tell of their glorious
deaths, from Mother de Sales In 1857 to the
spotlesB soul that passed, away but last week.
DIED LIKE BRAVE SOLDIERS.
They died like brave soldiers at their post of
duty, never flinching day nor night. These
fifty years of work and trial have built up a
splendid community here in this diocese, but
tney have formed a more glorious community
beyond the. stars. As we look back we . have

fate; tpeje are thousands more of whom it
might well be said It were better that they
had never been born. s
The slums of this great city is like a huge
morass inhabited by noisome reptiles whoso
lives begin in vice' and end in -a curse; to
whom life is but a Dante's hell, over 'the door
of which Is written: '"All who enter here
leave all hope behind." , Often have you and I
eeen .the young and the innocent and the beau
tiful go -down Into -the dreadful mire and are
eoon. lost to all sense of decency and virtue,
trampled under foot by the iron hoof of stern
alternative: starve or sin. Young and beauti
ful girts, whose j souls washed white in the
purifying of baptism, made whiter still
as they fed on the bread of angels; girls who
have struggled for a- decent livelihood In our
stores, factories and sweatshops, contending
day by day against 'the grasping avarice of
mammon until, overworked and underfed, their
weakened- bodies can stand the struggle no
longer; until, with one despairing cry, they
plunge into the dark ravine, and all is lost.
Oh, who Is there who will stand by with
warning voice, tell them of the danger, or with
consecrated hands snatch them from the brink
before the plunge lg made? Who is there who
has the devoted heart that beats in sympathy
for weak, poor, frail human nature will pour
out the wealth of love that only a woman's
heart is big enough 'to' hold, and lead them
back to the path of rectitude?
Oh, devoted Sisters of Mercy. I preach you a
new crusade, or rather I restate for you your
old vocation and. under altered conditions and
other circumstance*, point out to you the du
ties that are nearer to your hand. If religion
will ever more thoroughly commend itself to
the nwHws of the people, while it -saves souls
from that hell beyond the grave, it muet make
the world this side of the grave little less of a
hell to live in. While it lifts humanity up to
heaven, with strong, powerful arms, It must
bring some of heaven down to earth.
GREAT WORK WORTHILY DONE.
Right worthy has' your work of fifty years
been done. This city is all the better because
devoted women as you are have lived in It
and have been in toueh with air Its uplifting
forces. Many a girl has bade good-by to
friends and home with a stouter heart and
has braved . the; dangers of city Ilfe^ because
mercy hath set uj> her throne here and opened"
wide the *door"**r her. 1 . heart. For the years
that aref-to ctiraf it heÂ«d8 no prophetic voice
to tell of triumphs yej to be and, of victories
yet t to be 'won. Â» You. are 'Just about to break
ground â¢ for your â  .hew" '. 'hospital, and when
finished It will.be one 'of the great buildings
that i the people of San- Francisco will point
to with pride. ! It- will enshrine In its archi
tecture all the glorious memories of the padres
and bring into our modern life the symbols
of their heroic endeavors; It will carry to the
highest perfection ..the .sacred art of healing
the body, and there ,will- be no methods of
modern surgery that -will not receive their
highest exemplification:; :The work is at your
hand and' you afp ; better equipped to do It
to-daytthan were little band of fifty ..years

with : riper experience <and with- many more
devoted hearts and, what is far more Important
than everything else, j with a spirit of zeal
and devotion and an . inheritance of saintly
memories "from . two brave women who have
gone before you, with the sign of the faith.
These are your treasures and with them you
will march on to greater victories.
Fifty years have- not traced on your cheek
the lines .of age nor,- is there any mark of
decreptitude in your; gait. The first flush of
youth Is ' In thy face . and there is vigor and
strength in thy right-hand. As Longfellow
so beautifully expresses it:
"Oh, what a glory doth the heavens put on
- Kor him who with fervent heart goes forth
Under the bright and glorious sky,
And looks on duty well performed
And days well snent."

COURT DECIDES
AGAINST EMERY
Patient in Stockton Asylum
Tries to Prove That He
Was i "Railroaded" There
READY WITH ANSWERS
Freedom Is Denied Him on
Testimony of Physicians
of the State Institution
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON. Dec. 15.â A. R. Emery,
formerly of Oakland, now an inmate
of the State Insane Asylum, was before
Judge Smith to-day on habeas corpus
proceedings. He claimed to be sane,
and to have been "railroaded" to the
asylum. Attorney Stetson' appeared on
behalf of the State Lunacy Board-
Emery's petition set forth that he had
been adjudged a lunatic upon the testi
mony of his wife and children, vrho
wished to get him out of the way. O.
W. Jaycox. a friend of the Oakland
man, instituted the proceedings to Be
cure Emery's freedom. At no time
while under the fire of Stetson's search
ing cross-questions did Emery appear
at a loss for an answer. >v
Stetson questioned Emery about hli
actions while in Denver a few months
ago, and Emery stated that he had
made considerable money by establish
ing a school for teaching bricklaying.
He testified that he took seven pudIIs
and guaranteed to teach them how to
lay brick for the sum of $100 each. He
said that the pupils learned In Â»three
weeks. â¢ :'/. J
"You say you charged $700 for thre*
weeks' work?" asked the attorney.
"I said I got that much: I didn't say
I earned it," replied Emery.
"Wasn't $100 apiece an exorbitant
price to charge them?" queried Mr.
Stetson.
"Well, I don't know," retorted the al
leged lunatic. "You sometimes get lots
more than that Just for working your
mouth a few hours In court."
Emery was on the stand two hours
and proved to be a sharp witness, but
on the testimony of the asylum physi
cians touching his history and habits
he was remanded.

SITTINGS SUSPENDED
Because of Obstruction an
Appeal to the Country
May Shortlv Be Made
BUDAPEST. Dec. 15.â The Parlia
mentary truce has been short-lived.
The session of the lower house of the
Hungarian Parliament to-day wit
nessed a. repetition of the turbulence
that has marked most of the recent sit
tings. The members of the opposition
emphatically declined to recognize the
new rules of procedure, and greeted
Premier Tisza's attempts to speak with
euch a Btorm of invective and other
noisy Interruptions that the. sitting had
to be suspended repeatedly.
Francis Kossuth and Count Apponyi
denounced the new rules as "violations
of all parliamentary usage," adding
tnat "they mfÂ£bt as well throw the
â w hole constitution to the winds as rec
ognize the new rules."
When Premier Tisza rose to reply the
uproar broke out. Count Andrassy,
Francis Kossuth and others urged their
followers to listen to the Premier, but
their Â«tforts had little effect. The Dep
uties rushed across the floor in great
diFor/Jer. amid which a Liberal Deputy
Vis heard to shout:
"Obstruction must be driven out with
whips."
Tells of rage greeted the threat and
continued until the Vice President sus
pended the sitting.
Shortly after the resumption the sit
ting had to be again suspended owing
to a renewal of the tumult. At a third
attempt to continue business the Gov
ernment, by a majority of 76. managed
to carry a motion summoning Deputy
LecgraJ to appear before the Committee
on Privi leges for disorderly conduct in
the bouse, but when Premier Tisza
again rose to speak he was once more
howled down, the opposition informing
the Premier that he would not be al
lowed to speak until the new rules were
withdrawn.
A conference between the Liberal
members of Parliament and Premier
Tisza discussed the situation. It was
decided that if the opposition contin
ued its obstruction tactics an appeal
would shortly be taken to the country.

ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 15. â From
the lips of a high personage who at
tended the trial of Sasoneff, the as

Plehwe, the press is enabled to give
the substance of the prisoner's speech,
in which he strove to justify his act.
Sasoneff spoke calmly and eloquently,
explaining the aims and objects of his
Socialist revolutionary party.
The reason for Von Plehwe's mur
der, the prisoner said, was his own
biography. Sasoneff told how he
joined the party and committed the
crime* He declared that the Socialist
revolutionary party did not contem
plate a forcible destruction of autoc
racy, realizing the impossibility of
such a task without the aid of an
army. .
The Socialist revolutionary party.
Sasoneff said, was entirely different
from the party of the "national will,"
which slew Emperor Alexander II.
This latter party was engaged in a
desperate duel with the autocracy, in
which to annihilate was the sole aim
and object. The Socialist revolution
ary party was a peaseful propaganda
to show the evils of autocracy and
gradually inculcate the principles of
Socialism among all classes of the na
tion, realizing, however, that the at
tainment of a perfect Socialistic state
was so remote that "by the time it Js
reached Russia, autocracy will be
obliterated from the face of the globe."
This peaceful and idealistic mission
encountered the ruthless opposition of
certain Ministers, such as Bogoliepoff ,
Minister of Public Instruction (who
was shot on January 27, 1901, and died
on March 13 of the same year), and
Sipiaguine, Minister of the Interior (as
sassinated on April 15, 1902). and no
tably Von Plehwe, who made a busi
ness of hunting down apostles oi
Socialism. The party was compelled
to defend Itself and this gave rise to
a fighting organization whose members
are pledged to exterminate persecutors.
Sasoneff closed with a declaration
that no power on earth was able to
stop the spread of the human ideals of
the Socialist revolutionary party, whose
work was carried on by thousands of
willing hands throughout the length
and breadth of the empire.

LAWYER TELLS

Frederick Bussell Explains
Why He Demanded Half
His Client's Inheritance
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â¢ 1016 Broadway, Dec 15.
Attorney Frederick Russell spent an
uncomfortable half-day this afternoon
explaining to Judge Melvin how he
came to ask Mrs. Jennie de Soza and
her husband a fee of one-half for col
lecting an inheritance valued at 511,148.
They are now suing to have set aside
the contract wherjsby they agreed to
pay him such a sum, and he was sub
jected to a severe cross-examination, by
Attorney Charles Peery of San Fran
cisco in regard to the circumstances
surrounding the signing of the. docu
ment. â  â  â¢ . . , '
Russell eaJd that he did not consider
it too much, because the girl could not
get the money until her grandmother,
Mrs. Catherine Griffin, died. The old
lady's time In this world could not be
foretold. He acknowledged that he sent
a trusted messenger to Guerneville, in
Sonoma County, to get a report on the
old lady's state of health, and found
that she was losing her memory fasc
and kept repeating things. And she
died shortly afterward.
It transpired that when Mrs. de Soza
signed the first contract she was in. the
County Jail. This was before she had
become of age, and afterward she
Eigned another one when - she had
reached her majority. The second eon
tract was altered somewhat and gave
Russell not only half of the estate, but
his charges for other services. For this
work he was to act as their attorney
and kelp get the money and advance
them Eums, and did advance them all
told $260, but the amount to be ad
vanced was left entirely In his discre
tion. He said he told them once that
he did not want their business, and
then acknowledged that he refused
52000 to release them from their bar
gain.
The testimony was completed with
his evidence and the case ha* gone over
to January 7 for argument.

1016 Broadway. . Dec ; 15.
Tempted by the gjitter and glamour
of the footlights, Nellie 1 St. Clalr. a
pretty octoroon, became a thief to get
the outfit with which to make her debut
in the world of comedy. Unfortunately
for this stage-struck young woman, her
plans went awry. Instead of realizing
her dearest ambition Miss St. Clair has
landed in the hands of the police., The
comely priBoner has confessed to the
theft of a trunkful of finery from the
City of Paris store, San. Francisco. The
detectives have : recovered all of the
â tolen apparel.
Miss St. Clair was discriminating: in
the selection of her wardrobe. She
headed the list with a tailor-made suit,
valued at $70. To match that swasreer
garment she took a modish hat. tick
eted $25. Then she selected a black
velvet dress pattern and added a lone
string of dainty bits of woman's wear
and use, including: silk dress patterns,
handkerchiefs,, toilet articles, under
wear and perfumes.
Miss St. Clair's fatal error was in
waiting too long after she had pro
cured the valuable outfit before leaving
the city. Her # plan of operations was
clever enough." A few weeks ago the
young woman was engaged as -lady's
maid at the residence of W. E, Howe.
115 Athol avenue. While there she
learned, that the Howes had an account
at the City of Paris. Armed with that
knowledge she visited the store one day
and selected the goods, which were
promptly sent to the Howe home. Miss
St. Clair received the outfit and shortly
afterward left the Howes''emDloy.pre
parlng to abandon the prosaic Held of
domestic activities for the thrill of an
actress' life. â  , V .
When the bill was presented to the
Howes they disclaimed all knowledge
of the transaction. ThÂ» City of ISpris
people sent for the police.
But Miss St. Clair's histrionic ambi
tion got her into more trouble. She re
quired some dressmaking done. The
easiest way to meet that situation
without drawing on her meager finan
cial resources was to get a sewing ma
chine and go to work. She did get the
machine, but in such a devious way
that E. L. Sargent, the agent, caused
herarrest. It was while sentence of ten
days' imprisonment was being imposed
this, morning upon the girl by Police
Judge Samuels that the transaction in
dry goods came to light through Inves
tigation of an inquiry from the San
Francisco police.
"I. was a fool," said the girl, when
she had told the police whe're Xo find the
stuff. "After I left home in tCew York
I got, engagements in vaudeville, and I
wanted to continue, but I needed an
outfit, and this is what happened."
Miss St. Clair said she had been mar
ried to William H. Taylor in New York.
She had lived in Oakland only & few
months before her arrest.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRID A YJ DECEMBER 16; 1904:
CROSSES BAY
TO WED AGAIN
G. A. Waterbury Defies His
Daughters and Gets a Li
cense in San Francisco
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street. ; Dec. 15.
Supremely indifferent, apparently, to
the fact that his four daughters had
stripped of its furniture the house at
1539 Prince street to which he expect
ed to bring his, brkle to-day, G... A.
Waterbury this afternoon obtained a
license in Sari Francisco to marry, a
second wife, while the girls who scorned
their proposed stepmother waited, in
suspense hero for sensational develop
ments that were expected to occur.
The daughters refused to permit Wat
erbury to enter the house last Tuesday,
because he had threatened, they say, to
put them all out when .he came back
with his new bride from across the
bay. Waterbury chose for his second
wife Mrs. Mary E. Crump of 531 Cas
tro street in San Francisco, and the
girls. resented bitterly her proposed in
trusion. They defied the father to car
ry out his programme of eviction, and
themselves barricaded the place and
kept their parent out in the cold.
Waterbury's house was denuded of all
its furniture last night by neighbors
friendly to the Waterbury girls, and
the stuff was taken to hidden places.
The daughters say it is their property,
but they anticipated trouble when
Waterbpry should return this afternoon
with his bride, as he had promised.
They kept out of sight, finding shelter
in the homes of friends.
Waterbury, however, did not create a
disturbance to-day. He heard of the
loss of the furniture, and apparently is
preparing to spend his honeymoon else
where. He did not appear in court
this morning, to press his charges of
battery against . S. J. Hankins and
Percy Betts, friends of the girls, whose
arrest he caused last night. The bail
money of Hankins and Betts was re
funded, and Hankins announced that
he would have Waterbury arrested on
a charge of malicious prosecution.
MJes May Waterbury explained 'this
morning that her father had left the
family shift for itself for two months,
while he worked in San Francisco, and
supposedly spent his money there, and
that his daughters had taken care of
themselves without his aid. Hence they
resented .the father's announcement
that a new wife was to come in and
rule the place which they considered
their own.
In taking out the license Waterbury
said to "Cupid" Danforth:
"Well, they tried to prevent my
marriage, but I guess I will fool
them."
Waterbury said he would marry
Mrs. Crump at once and expressed his
intention of seeking a minister to
officiate at the ceremony.

DEATH CHEATED
OF ITS VICTIM
Telephone Lineman Receives
Terrible Shock From Live
Wire and Falls Forty Feet
ALAMBDA, Dec. 15.â Winfleld Kear
ney, a lineman employed by the Pacific
States Telephone Company, received
2300 volts of electric current and top
pled forty feet from a- pole this after
noon and still lives to tell how it all
happened and felt.
With. Lionel Morell, another lineman,
Kearney was engaged in adjusting tele
phone wires at the corner of Park
street and Encinrtf avenue. He had
climbed a pole on which are strung, in
addition to i the telephone wires, the
wires carrying the day current gen
erated at the municipal electric plant.
In stooping over to take hold of a tele
phone wire Kearney's stomach came in
contact with a live wire from the elec
tric plant. In aH instant the lineman
was doubled up and for a second lay
across the dangerous line. Then â¢ his
limp form shot to the ground. Luckily
for Kearney, the earth 'near the base
of the pole was * soft -and sandy.-.
Morell, who -was working .on a pole
near by, observed Kearney's .plight and
immediately went to :hls assistance^
Kearney writhed for a time on the
ground and then sat up. He complained
of a numbness in his abdominal region,
but felt -strong enough to walk. He
was able to go to hi3 home at 2032
Railroad avenue and to-night was little
the worÂ§e for his thrilling experience.
Speaking of the accident Kearney said:
Although I knew there were live power wires
on the pole and tried to clear them in reach
ing for the telephone wires, I accidentally
thrust my stomach against a live line. Then
I was helpless. I knew I would fall, but was
powerless to assist myself. . If the earth where
1 struck had been hard I should very likely
have been seriously hurt. As It la.' I do not
feel much pain now from my experience, but
I never want to go through the same thing
again.

FIX THE FEES
OF ENGINEERS
City Council Will Pay One-
Half the Cost of Investi
gation of Water. Supply
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Dec 15.
With a fair indication that the city
will be called updn, under its agree
ment, to, pay at least one-half of the
cost of the engineers' investigation of
the Bay Cities Water Company's prop
osition of a municipal water supply,
rates of compensation were fixed to
night at an informal executive session
of the City Council.
The fees of A. M.. Hunt and . J. M.
Howell, the engineers associated with
City Engineer F. C. Turner on the ex
amining board, were fixed at $2500
each. The Council decided to recom
pense Turner, provided this can be le
gally done.' The .action in the matter
of fees lends strong color to the feel
ing in the City Council that the enei
neers will file a favorable report. No
statement, direct or indirect, has been
made by any one of the board, though
the fact that -they are working many
hours a day on data gives Couricilmen
the impression that their report will be
favorable. .... . -.. â¢ . '
. The agreement in regard to the com
pensation of the^ engineers is that if the
report of the examining board be un
favorable to the project, the Bay Cities
Water Company shall bear the entire
expense of making the examination.
If, on the other hand, the report be
favorable and'the City Council fail to
call a bond election, then the city shall
bear the entire expense. If the report
be favorable, and a*Â«ond election be
called, then the city and the company
divide the expense equally, no matter
what the vote might be on the proposi
tion. .

2148 Center Street, Dec. 15.
After exhaustive â¢ discussion of the
proposal to provide Berkeley with parka
and a manual training school, to be
paid for with money from the salÂ© of
bonds, the joint committee of the local
improvement clubs decided last night
to put the matter in concrete form at
the next meeting and then vote upon
it. The result. of the vote will, be sub
mitted to the Town Trustees, Vwho are
expected to be guided in the way of a
municipal bond project by this expres
sion "of opinion from the joint improve
ment clubs.
Victor Robertson presided at the
meeting, was held In Francis
Ferrier's office last night. The .clubs
were represented by the following men:
South Berkeley Improvement Club, H.
E. Myllck and H. C. Bagot; .North
Berkeley, Victor . Robertson;- Ashby
Club, Stacy Gibbs, A. R. Frame and
A. S. J. Woods; West Berkeley, J. T.
Renas and Charles Hadlen; Central
Club, C. D. Maloney and J. Wendering.
Serious consideration was given to a
proposal to run a railway to Grizzly
Peak, the highest point back of Berke
ley, and there establish a park. A. F.
Hess said he had consulted an en
gineer and learned that a double-track
trolley line could be put In for about
$30,000. J. L. Tisdale believed a cog
track railway might be run straight
up Grizzly Peak.
H. C. Bagot favored a system of
email parks, and Town Treasurer Lord
expressed his belief that other improve
ments were needed In Berkeley besides
parks, and that the latter should wait.
Town Auditor Hanscom. C. r>. Maloney
and A. R. Frame argued in favor of the
park project. A. F. Hess declared the
view of the Golden Gate to . be ob
tained from the foothills one of the
finest panoramas in the world, and
that a park giving an unobstructed
view of this sort would be a magnifi
cent attraction and advertisement for
Berkeley.
President Robertson outlined the
manual training school plan, saying
that separate classes would be estab
lished in the Lincoln, Le Conte, Mc-
Kinley, Whittier and San Pablo ave
nue schools. It would cost $12,000 to
put these classes in operation, and $8000
would be needed for land for additional
area.

WHAT DO YOU CARE?
YOU'VE GOT YOUR HEALTH
C.nat Natures Do Not Despair at Dis-
appointment â They Look for
Something ELs^e to Do.
The broad-grauged man of to-day
docs not gret blue just because things
don't always come his way unless there
is something the matter with him. If.
he "falls down" on one proposition
h<? immediately starts to look up an-
other. He always looks forward and
keeps on hustling. A man with his
health and faculties has plenty of op-
portunities and the man who gives up
or even feels like it has either a small
nature or some physical weakness.
Dyspepsia certainly puts the best of j
men out of condition for work of any
kind. You cannot blame the dyspeptic
for setting blue. The very, nature of
his disease is most depressing and cal- j
culated to deprive him of ambition, J
energy and hope. There fs hope for
him, however, certain and sure.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are rec-
oprnized throughout the length and !
breadth of the land as the one cure ,
that's safe and sOre. Their unbounded j
popularity â resulting from the thou-
st nds and thousands of cures they
have effected â prove beyond the
shadow of a doubt their greatness as
a cure. Wherein lies their greatness?
In the very fact that they are Nature's
, own simple remedy. They do the
e^act work in exactly the same way
the digestive fluids of the stomach
do because they are composed of ex-
actly the same elements and possess
the same properties. They relieve the
weak and worn-out stomach of its bur-
. den of digestion and permit it with-
out let or hindrance to rest and grow
sound and well. The stomach will get
well quick enough in its own natural
way if it is let alone. That is what
Btnart'a Dyspepsia Tablets do. They
not only let it alone themselves, but
rrake the food taken into the stomach
do the Fame.
You can satisfy yourself of the truth
of this statement by putting the food
you would eat into a glass jar with
sufficient water and one of Stuart's
Dysnesia Tablets. The process of di-
Efstion will be taken up and carried
out just as the gastric juice and other
digestive fluids would do it. Their ac-
tion is natural and they cause no dis-
turbance in the digestive organs. In
fsct. you forget you have a stomach
when they begin to do their work, so
mild and natural is the operation.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for sale
by all druggists at 50c a box.

WYXXE WIELDS THE AX
3Ien Discharged for Send
ing Out Circulars \sking
for Support of Legislation
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.â As the re
sult of an investigation of their activ
ity during the recent political cam
pairn. Warren F. Tumber. a rural mail
carrier at Lockport, X. Y., and H. W.
Aldr'ch. a rural carrier of Concord, N.
H.. both of the National Association of
Rural Free Delivery Carriers, were to
day removed forthwith from the Gov
ernment Rervtce by Postmaster Gen
eral Wynne. Tumber is secretary of
tÂ»ie national association of carriers and
he and Aldrich are members of its ex
ecutive board.
The rharges, the investigation of
which by postoffice inspectors resulted
in to-day's action, was that the dis
missed men sent out circular letters
during the last campaign to candidates
for Congress urging legislation in the
interest of the carriers and demanding
that the men to whom the letters were
addressed pledge themselves to vote
for such legislation. President Cun
ningham, who was dismissed Tuesday,
and Secretary Tumber, according to
the postal authorities, framed the cir
cular and Tumber signed it as secre
tary and issued it. Aldrich was one
of the executive committee, who agreed
on the work which was subsequently
carried out.
A number of the letters sent out are
in the possession of the Postoffice De
partment.* In one of the papers on file
is the expression "We must look out
for ourselves aud help the fellows that
help us." A number of other cases are
under consideration, but the question
of the guilt of the employes involved
ha,s not yet been decided.
NEW FRAUD ORDERS.
Postal Department Takes Action
Against Western Concerns.
WASHINGTON. Dec 15. â Fraud or
ders were to-day signed by the Assist
ant Attorney General for the Post
office Department against the follow
ing concerns, whichr are charged with
violations of the postals laws and reg
ulations: The Franco- American Mer
cantile Company of San Francisco and
T. P. Miller. Seattle, Wash.
In the case of the first concern the
charge is conducting a lottery, the
scheme being to enter into a contract
with a person, the latter paying $1 a
week until J80 is paid, when the con
tract becomes mature and is taken up
by the company for $160. Certain ex
penses are taken out and none of the
contracts are paid until $160 is in the
treasury. Thus, one persons pays an
other and the company profits from
the "expenses" charged all holders of
papers.
T. P. Miller of Seattle was the pur
ported agent of the Cumulative Credit
Company of San Francisco, against
which company a fraud order was is
sued some time agoand its mail there
fore is not to be carried by the United
States. ,

TWO NEW STIRS
FOR OLD GLORY
Senate â¢ Committee Prepares
to Make a Favorable Ke
port on the Statehood Bill
CONTEST JS EXPECTED
Oklahoma and Indian Terri
tory Are Combined, as Are
Arizona and New 3Iexico
WASHINGTON. Dec. 15.â The Senate
Committee on Territories, by a vote of
six to four, to-day authorized a favor
able report on the statehood bill Dro
vidirfg for admission into the Union of
Oklahoma and Indian Territory, to be
come the State of Oklahoma, and of
Arizona and New Mexico, to become
the State of Arizona; The closeness of
the vote practically makes it certain
that there will be a minority report.
To-morrow Senator Beveiidge, chair
man of the committee having the bill
in charge, will submit the majority re
port. The opponents of the bill will
contest its passage on the floor of the
Senate. The statehood bill will be the
unfinished business of the Senate after
a vote is had to-morrow on the Philip
pine bill.
"Nearly all of the time since the open
ing of the present session of Congress
the Senate Committee on Territories
has been at work perfecting the House
bill, but it was not until late to-day
that a vote could be had. the death of
Senator Quay, who had fought per
sistently for admission of each of the
four Territories as a separate State,
leaving the committee equally divided.
The vacancy was filled yesterday by
the appointment of Senator Dick. Those
who voted to-day for the bill were Sen
ators Beveridge, Dillingham, Nelson,
Dick, Burnham and Kean, all Republi
cans. Senator Bard (R.) voted against
the bill, together with Senators Bate
and Newlands. Democrats. The fourth
vote against the bill was that of Sena
tor Patterson, who was absent, but was
recorded as voting. Senator "Clark of
Arkansas also was absent.
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Dec. 15.â News that
the joint statehood bill would be favor
ably reported in the Senate caused
great excitement in this city to-day,
and was the principal topic of conver
sation. Maricopa County's Board of
Trade at once passed resolutions of
protest, which were wired to B. A.
Fowler, at Washington, Republican
candidate for Congress at the recent
election. Communication was estab
lished with all organized municipal and
commercial bodies in the Territory
asking them to make similar pro
tests.
Other messages were sent to the
Chambers of Commerce of Los Anee
les and San Francisco, appealing for
their support in the effort to defeat the
bill. Arizona's organized bodies and
officials have unanimously and continu
ously protested against joint statehood,
and say they will do so to the end.
AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED.
Philippine Administration Bill Dls
ctifesed In Senate.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 15.â The Sen
ate spent practically the entire day
discussing the Philippine administra
tive bill. A number of amendments
were suggested and debated, among
them being provisions relating to rail
road bonds, mining locations and tar
iff rates. Under unanimous agreement
the vote on the bill will be taken to
morrow and the disposal of all the
amendments will occur at the same
time.
Platt of Connecticut, chairman of the
select committee to consider the rec
ommendation cf the House of Repre
sentatives for the impeachment of
Judge Swayne, presented tjne report of
that committtee. The report was in
the shape of an order, which, after re
citing the circumstances in a preamble,
proceeds as follows:
Ordered that the Senate will, according to
its Etandingr rules and orders in such cases
provided, take proper action thereon (upon the
presentation of the articles of Impeachment)
of which due notice shall be riven to the
House of Representatives.
The resolution was agreed to.
The urgent -deficiency appropriation
bill was passed without debate.
When tke Philippine administration
bill was taken up Stewart spoke in sup
port of the railroad bond provision,
saying that no other agent was equal
to railroads as civilizers of savages.
McCumber opposed the bond provi
sion and offered an amendment strik
ing it out.
Heyburn addressed himself to the ex
isting law affecting mining locations in
the Philippines, and offered ' an
amendment, providing, in effect; for
the return to the American method of
location instead of the Spanish method
adopted in the present law.
Without taking action on Heyburn'B
amendment, the Senate passed to the
consideration of an amendment sug
gested by Newlands in the shape of a
substitute for the railroad bond pro
vision of the bill. The substitute re
duces the rate of interest on the bonds
to 2}i per cent and provides that they
shall be guaranteed by the Govern
ment of the United States. The amend
ment also provides a method of taxing
the proceeds of the railroads In the
islands. - . "S 4 ;
VICTORY FOR THE SOUTH.
Bill to Reduce Representation Will Bo
Reported Unfavorably.
' WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.âReduc
tion of the Southern representation In
Congress, either through the Platt or
Morrell bill, Is highly improbable.
The House Committee on Election of
President, Vice President and Repre
sentatives will soon render a report
unfavorable to the reduction idea.
The committee is now swayed by the
Idea that the disfranchisement evil will
correct itself in time and that any
legislation now would give results
which future conditions will render
unnecessary- The remedy is looked
for in increased immigration to the
Southern States, with the result that
the white , population will .be so
strengthened that its votes will always
be In a majority^
OBSTRUCTIVE TACTICS.
Democrats Delay 1 Advancement of Bill
to Improve . Currency Conditions.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.âDiscus
sion of the bill to "improve currency
conditions" was resumed in the House
to-day, but throughout the j session its
advancement was beset with obstruc
tive tactics by the Democrats, led by
Williams of Mississippi, /the minority
leader. The Democrats mustered suf
ficient strength to force Speaker Can
non to break a tie in order that the
bill might be taken, up, 7 the Demo
crats assuming their attitude of an
tagonism because Hill, of Connecticut,
in charge of the bill, refused to, allow
its further consideration; in conse
quence of the, illness of Bartlett of
Georgia, leader of the opposition.
We can't imagine a more â  dangerous
combination than a loose tongue and
ignorance. * -;.
TAKES AS WIFE
A DEAD WOMAN
Witness in Smoot Inquiry
Tells of His "Sealing"
for Time and Eternity
DESCRIBES GARMENTS
Robes Worn at Endowment
House Ceremony Marked
in Most Peculiar Manner
WASHINGTON'. Dec. 15. â August
Lundstrom was recalled for cross-ex
amination when the Senator Smoot In
vestigation was resumed to-day before
the Seriate Committee on 'Privileges
and Elections. '-Attorney Van Cott,
for Senator Smoot, asked the witness
if hef had ever considered the obliga
tions taken in the temple as a huge joke
or' in the light of a vaudeville per
formance.
"I always regarded the oaths as sa
cred,'* he said. Then he aeclared that
men cannot pass through the temple
to take endowments for women. I
John Nicholson, the chief recorder of
the Mormon Temple at Salt Lake City,
was -sworn. He proved the most re
luctant witness of all the church offi
cials who have been brought before
the committee.
Dy a slow process the attorney ,for
the protestants . drew from him the
fact that he keeps the fecords^bf mar
riages, baptisms and endowments
which are solemnized within the tem
ple. He explained that the endow
ments are the placing upon individuals
blossinRK that will be upon them dur
ins this life and all eternity.
Lundstrom at the afternoon session
/explained his marriage to a dead wom- i
an, and said this ceremony Is called
"pealing," and was for time and eter
nity. He also was sealed to his legal
wife, he said, but" no record or memor
andum was given him. The witness
said he had heard the Endowment
House obligations administered six
times to congregations of from thirty
to sixty persons each. Not to take
the obligation, the witness said, is re
garded as a sign of weaKness to the
faith. Robes are worn in the ceremony.
There are no marks on ,the robes, but
there are marks on^the priesthood gar
ments. These marksNare to remind the
person of the covenant he had made.
The witness said there are marks of
the compass and the square on the left
and right breasts, a rent like a button
hole over the navel and another over
the knee.
"When do you wear this garment?"
Lundstrom was asked.
"Always."
He added that the garment was re
moved only long enough to change to
a clean one. ,
"It is supposed to be a shield aeainst
all danger, temporal and spiritual," he
said. v
"And the marks are to remind you of
the obligation taken?" asked the chair
man.
The witness answered in the affirma
tive, repeating that the breast marks
are for the purpose of making the obli
gator remember his oath not to reveal
his covenants under penalty of having
his heart and vitals cut out.
On cross-examination he said the
marks never had been* explained to
him, and that he put his own construc
tion on them becawe of. their associa
tion with the ceremonies.
The hearing was continued until to
morrow.

CHILDREN DIE
IN ICY WATERS
Sorrow Brought. to Several
Homes by Collapsing of a
Bridge in West Virginia
PEDESTRIANS INJURED
School Boys and Girls on
Structure at Time of Dis
aster Lose Lives in River
CHARLESTON. W. Va., Dec. 15.â
Three persons are known to have been
killed and four others seriously injured
by the collapse of the suspension
bridge across the Elk RfVer which con
nects East and West Charleston. At
the time the bridge went down there
were six teams and six children on
their way to school and a number of
other pedestrians on the structure. The
bridge went down without warning, but
a number of. those who were near the
ends of the structure managed to reach
land. Those who went down with the
wreckage fell a distance of forty feet
into the ice-covered waters of the river.
The depth of the river at this point is
variously estimated at from ten to
twenty feet, and when the iron and
lumber wreckage struck the icelt broke
into fragments; and those killed and
several of the Injured were thrown Into
the waters or swept under the ice* far
ther down the stream. The dead:
MAMIE HIGGINBOTHAM, aged 11
years.
ANNIE HUMPHREYS, aged 17 years.
OLLIE GIBBS, aged 15 years.
The injured: Zella Smith, aged 17
years, compound fracture of elbow;
William Holmes, colored, driver, cut
and bruised; Henry Fielder, driver, se
rious internal injuries; Elmer Tucker,
aged 13 years, both arms and legs
broken.
The bridge was a single span 500 feet
in length and was built in 1S52. It has
been known to be unsafe for some time
and heavy traffic was not allowed on
it. The accident was caused bv two
cables on the north side slipping from
their moorings. When that side dropped
another cable on the other side snapped,
the floor tilted and turned ' completely
over.
During the Civil War/ the cable of
this bridge was cut bjr General Wise
when he evacuated/Charleston, the
bridge at the same time being partly
burned. The same cable was afterward
spliced and has been in use ever since.

THE NEW BILL OF LADING.
IX commerce the bill of lading is negotiable commercial paper.
It represents its value in property shipped to market. In finance
the draft follows the bill of lading, and is met at the point of
exchange. This process has the validation and support of the law
of common carriers. A railroad, being a common carrier, is re
sponsible for the safe delivery of the merchandise which it is paid
to carry, and under the law must make good any loss, except it be
caused by what the law recognizes as "the act of God," that is to
*say, by something unforeseen and against which foreguarding is im-
The views of the President respc ' : ng the. need of proper, eco
nomic and conservative regulation of . uses of combined capital
are promptly supported by a combination that has appeared among
all of the leading railroads of the country for the purpose of avoiding
their liability as common carriers. This combination has prepared
and printed the enormous number of 55,000,000 bills of lading of two
classes. One of these forms advances the freight rate 20 per cent
and guarantees the shipper against loss of his property in transit.
The other form docs not advance the rate," but expressly , provides
that the railroad shall not be responsible for any loss. The shipper
may take his choice. The first form turns the railroad into an in
surance company, and the shipper pays to it a 20 per cent premium
to insure him from loss. The second form makes every shipper his
own insurer, and both forms evade the* responsibility of the railroad
as a common carrier. It is announced that if this scheme work it
.will be applied also to passenger transportation. There will be two
kinds of tickets, as of bills of lading, and a traveler will insure him
self by paying a higher rjrice for his ticket, or he will go uninsured
on a cheaper ticket and the railroad will not be responsible for kill
ing or wounding him.
The first publicity was given to the new .bill of lading by the
bankers. Under the existing system, when an owner of property
ships it to a market, his bill of lading is taken as collateral at a bank.
He can borrow money on it, and the bank draft goes forward with the
bill of lading to the consignee, and is paid when the property is sold.
But the new bill of lading of the first class, carrying the 20 per cent
advance in the freight rate, is marked "not negotiable," which means
that it is not commercial paper, has no mobility, and cannot be used
as" collateral. The bill of lading of the second class, as it releases
the railroad from all responsibility for loss of the property it covers,
is not negotiable, for the property is at owner's risk, and if a
bank took the bill it would become the insurer of the property and
have to stand its loss.
This proposed change is the most threatening that has ever ap
peared in the history of commerce. It works backward into the
whole field of production and exchange, and forward into the whole
field of consumption. Under it the small shipper would disappear.
He must use his credit, in the form of the bill of lading, for his
capital. He cannot safely ship unless protected by the common car
rier's liability, nor can he do business without the use of his credit,
represented by the bill of lading. It is because he cannot do this
that he is a small shipper. He is a competitor in factoring the
products of the country, and has a function that is absolutely neces
?ary for the protection of the producer as well as the consumer. But
the new bill of lading destroys him. It gives combined capital, in
the hands of the big shipper, the monopoly of the factoring of the
products of the country. Such capital does not need to negotiate the
bill of lading; it does not need to use credit at all. It can ship on
the bill of lading of the first class, pay its 20 per cent premium in the
form of increased rate and charge the advance off to the consumer.
It will be seen then that the new bill of lading creates auto
matically a trust in the factoring and shipping of all the products
of the country. Taking advantage of the contractual relation that
necessarily exists between the common carrier and the shipper, this
bill releases the railroad from common carrier liability. The revolu
tion in methods is so thorough, so far reaching and so injurious
that we believe the courts will invalidate the new bill of lading as a
contract in restraint of trade and against good conscience and pub
lic policy. President Roosevelt has exposed the effect of rebates
and declared that they must stop. Commercial methods are analo
gous by their effect. The rebate favors one shipper over another. It
is a covert arrangement to destroy competition in the factoring and
shipping of the products of the country. It automatically creates a
trust in such business. The egg out of which the Standard Oil trust
hatched was a rebate. It is perfectly plain that the new bill of
lading is a substitute for the rebate. It is analogous because its
effect is the same. As the rebate is open to legislative prohibition, so
must be this substitute for it.
The new bills were to go into effect January 1 next. The banks
sounded the alarm and a hurried hearing, for which the shippers
were imperfectly prepared, was called before the Interstate Com
merce Commission. Xo conclusion has been reached b} r the com
mission, but the hearing resulted in the "uniform bill of lading" com
mittee, representing all the railroads, agreeing to postpone use of
the new bill until February 1, 1905. This extension of time should
be used by the banks, commercial bodies and organizations of'pro
ducers in covering the whole country not only with protests but
with testimony to the injurious effect of the new* bill of lading. One
banker put it in a nutshell when he said: "Under the common car
rier's liability law we always knew that the bill of lading would
produce either the goods or the money." To this the railroads
pleaded that the. increased losses of property in transit make it nec
essary to increase freight rates 20 per cent, if the roads are to con
tinue to stand the loss. To this it is properly answered that the
losses in transit are caused^ by the acts of the railroad and its
agent?, and if the loss is too great let it be reduced by greater care
and discipline. But is it true that the railroads cannot stand the
losses caused by themselves? In 1903 their total earnings were
$1,342487,051, their losses were only $13,726,508, and their profits
$197,148,576. From this it does not appear that they are impov
erished under their liability as common carriers. j
The commerce of California is vitally interested in this matter
and our bankers and commercial bodies should keep informed
about it.
RECOGNITION FOR LUTHER BURBANK.
â¢""VMJFORNIAX horticulturists will be pleased at the news
I. which comes from Washington to the effect that the trustees
V " - Tof the Carnegie Institute have decided to settle upon Luther
Burbank, "the plant wizard," a ten-year endowment, sufficient to
equip him thoroughly for continued experiments along the lines of
plant hybridization. This recognition from the directors of the
Carnegie Institute is designed to come as a practical measure for
promoting the work which Mr. Burbank is doing for horticultur
ists the country over.
Xo more deserved benefice has ever fallen to a man of science.
For thirty years Luther Burbank has been evolving new plants,
new fruits, new flowers as the result of tireless experiment and dar
ing invention. Plums without:, pits, walnuts that are . nearly all
meat, potatoes doubling in size their humble progenitors, flowers
streaked and spotted as never even indulgent nature paintedâ these
have all come from Burbank's experiment farm up in Sonoma
County. Only within the last week has the report come down from
his laboratory that an ever-blooming Australian lily is the latest
achievement of science over nature- to mark the ingenuity of the
wizard.
The practical benefit accruing from these many, innovations
may be measured by the horticulturists of the State in set terms
of dollars and cents. At present time the Burbank quince flourishes
among the most prolific of fruit frees. Of the various breeds of
plum and prune most remunerative to the grower Burbarik's hybrid
productions lead. Not only in this State but throughout the East
the influence of the wizard's efforts finds substantial place . in the

SPRING SONG
By (k. M. Davies Ogden.
_^ BREATH of spring was already
M in the air. March had come, the
winter was over, and to-night
f\ was the last opera night of the
J . season. "Die Walkure" was
â¼ being given with a phenomenal
cast, and the house was crowded. Even
the boxes filled early.
Mrs. Wilmore, gorgeous, fussy, im
portant in white satin with rows of
emeralds, fluttered to her Beat, care
fully assigning the places for her three
guests. She had brought Mabel with
her for a definite purpose which she
did not mean should miscarry, and as
the girl leaned back in the chair, her
aunt eyed her sharply. But Mabel had
sense! She knew what was expected
of her, and after their talk this after
noon she was not likely to do anything
foolish. Luckily that affair with young
Cortright was ended. And Mrs. Wil
more turned to chat at her ease with
the elderly beau at her shoulder. Music
held no charms for her.
â¢The girl, too, stared in but listless
fashion at the stage where Sigmund
lay exhausted by the dying fire. What
significance did it hold for her? Once
she had loved music, but now â The
girl shivered slightly, feeling that all
emotion lay dead in her heart. Henc,e
forth luxury, comfort; was to be her
desire. Glancing up at the gallery
gods, where they leaned In ecstacy, her
lip curled in memory of the times when
she, too, had sat there, contrasting
those times unfavorably with her pres
ent position. And that cold little room
that she called home!
The man beside her could give all
that heart could wish; the countless re
sources of immense wealth lay at his
command. And to-night she had been
brought here that he might ask her to
Bhare all this. Tamely she sat, await
ing his pleasure. For a moment the
girl's pride revoltedâ a hot flush burned
her face. It had not been like this
when Randolph had begged her to wait
for him.
"I love you! I love you!" he had
Faifl, his clear blue young eyes looking
straight into hers. "And -when I. have
won a home I shall come for you."
But that was a year and more ago
now. And matters had been growing
steadily worse with her. First had
come the long illness, using up her
little hoard; then her difficult strug
gle to resume work. How different
everything would have been if her
father had only lived. Her mother
was a mere vague, beautiful memory.
There was only Aunt Ella left. And
Aunt Ella, though she meant to be
kind, was not generous. Then Gran
ville Whittaker had appeared on the
scene and, to her aunt's unbounded
triumph, had been captured by the
girl's high bred beauty. Thereafter,
morning, noon and night, Aunt Ella
had impressed upon her the duty of
accepting this opportunity.
"Think of all you can do with such
a fortune," she urged. "All the peo
ple you could help," skillfully striking
the effective chords. 'I All the good
you could do." And Mabel, tired, ex
hausted, felt her resistance breaking.
A month ago she had written Ran
dolph a few lines telling him that they
were too poor to marry â that an en
gagement between them was not fair
to either. (Aunt Ella's suggestion,
this.) And there had been no an
swer. Somehow she had not expected
him to let her go quite so easily; it
was not like him. Aunt Ella must be
right in saying that men forgot light
ly. She had waited, hoping for â she
knew not what. But now she felt
that the crisis could be put off no
longer. And, unemotionally, she
awaited the crucial moment.
But in spite of herself the glorious,
wondrous harmonies sweeping through
the orchestra began to assert their an
cient sway. On the stage^Sieglinde, all
in white, came creeping down the stair,
and Siegmund sprang to his feet. The
girl felt the starved sympathies within
her awakening. And then, with a sud
den soft preluding of exquisite sweet
ness, Siegmund broke into the full rush
and swing of the spring song, "Winter
Storms Now Wane to the Winsome
Moons."
The notes poured out in a very flood
of exultant joyousness. Mabel's throat'
contracted, her eyes glowed. "Thou art
the spring," rang Sieglinde's rapturous
answer, and the girl, utterly oblivious of
all else, bent forward, her lips parted,
her breath quietening, absorbed, en-

not hear. Her aunt frowned. But the

for outdoors, for J the eternal verities,
for life, was. beyond the reach of criti

beautiful dream that melted inevitably
Into the frosts and chill of winter!
There was no spriffg for her!
And then she. saw him. He stood in
the aisle, his eyes Jlxed on hers; then
he moved toward the nearest door. As
she waited the girl became dully aware
that she was trembling. The elderly
beau rose to leave the box, and as h*
passed out Randolph entered. Unheed
ful of the chill civility of Mrs. WH
more's bow, Cortright turned to the
gjrl.
"I went to your apartment, but they
told me that you had gone to the
opera," he said. "May I have a word
with you?"
Mrs. "Wilmore's frown was portentous.
"I am sure you can have nothing to
say to my niece that any one may not
hear," she said with stately politeness.
Cortright bowed.
"As you please. There is certainly
no thing that I am ashamed of," he
returned steadily. "Mabel, when your
letter came I- was out on the range; it
was delayed some weeks before I re
ceived It. After I had read it, for one
whole night I thought, thought hard;
then' I took the first train East. And
I am going to take you back with me.
I cannot risk losing you again." There
was a masterful ring- to' the words that
made the girl's heart - leap. . There
were men yet left in the world then!
"I have only this one night," went
on Cortright. "To-morrow we must
return, for this is a busy time. The
life is hard, yet it is fine, too. I â I do
not think it would be. too hard," wist
fully. "And I love you! I love you!

cry was as insistent . as the call of
primitive man j to his mate, and in
voluntarily the girl rose to her feet.
"Thou art the spring," she breathed,
echoing Sleglinde's cry, "the spring
I awaited!" All at once, in a sudden
flash of perception, she understood
that she had grasped the wrong end
of the truth; it was the spring that
was real. Winter was but the sturdy
guardian that watched over the tender
thing while it yet slept in the earth's
warm breast. Forgetful of Whittaker's
scowl, her aunt's anger, she moved
forward to where Cortright stood,
and lifting her eyes in a long loyal
gaze laid her hand in his.
"I am ready," she said simply.

THE VOICE.
IN that dim time when man was still
a brute.
He heard a Voice seductive as the
breeze
That kisses April buds. It wooed from
out
The heart of God. It moved wfthin him
slow,
Like faint, far echo from a new-struck
harpâ â¢
It thrilled him to a strange and sad un
rest >
No power had he to speak this pregnant
stir
To forceful wordsâ^to music â unto song;
But ah. the pain of that far distant time
When instincts . primal smote the con
sciousness,
When dazed eyes hot with unshed tears
looked out
Upon a brutish body, fanged and haired.
By day or night through all the endless
years
Ne'er ceased the Voice to sound its vi
brant call,
He heard it in the thunder's rolling
shock.
And on the wind that stirred him from
his lair; '
The shadow-hunted forest seemed alive
With a compelling force that took no
shape.
And when he stole his mate by strength
alone,
Something within him promising delight.
The fruitful impulse struck his lust
aside
And fixed his Joy upon the child instead.
Out from the dark to light he swiftly
grew.
Urged by the wondrous Voice that taught
him love.
The Vdice divine! He hears It clearly
now;
And all the heritage of memory
Stored in the boundless caves of time is
his.
For his interpretive ability
To reincarnate here â that man may
know
How long God called him ere he under
stood.
And still the earth moves on In rhythmic
swing.
Majestic with the farthest planets'
march;
And still God sends his Voice across the
wild.
Forevermore the struggling man shall
hear
And, hearing, tireless go the sorrowed
road.
His sonship proving â answering the
Voice.

cember Booklovers.
JAPANESE WIDOW'S HAIR
When a Japanese woman becomes a
widow it is customary for her to cut
off part of her hair and bury it In the
coffin with the body of her husband,
but as she may please herself about
it this sacrifice is not often large
enough to spoil her pretty coiffure, un
less, indeed, she determine to wear for
ever the badge of widowhood, and 1 give
her life In complete devotion to the
memory of the departed, in which case
she cuts it all off and thenceforth
never permits it to grow. There are a
great many women in Japan, and es
pecially in the heart of the country,
where foreign Influence has never
reached, who wear their hair bobbed
like a small boy's and oftentimes part
ed jauntily on the side; and by this
sign one may be sure that they are
widows, and that they hang many
prayer slips at the temple doors and
give their passing days in patient,
sweet devotion to the family and the
home wherein they are sure to be much
loved.â Eleanor Franklin in 'Leslie's
Weekly.
PARIS HOLIDAY SHOPPING
We had an exhausting day in Paris,
but managed to get pretty nearly
everything. The little children were
easily disposed of â dolls, drums, wood
en horses, etc.; but the bigger boys and
girls, who have outgrown toys, are
more difficult to suit. However, with
knives, paint boxes, lotos (geographical
and historical) for the boys; and hand
kerchief and work boxes, morocco bags,
etc, we did finally get our fifty ob
jects. There are always extra children
cropping up. Shopping was not very
easy, as the streets and boulevards
were crowded and slippery. We had a
fairly good cab, but the time seemed
endless. The big bazaarsâ Hotel de
Ville, rue d'Amsterdam, etc. â were the
most amusing; really, one could/ get
anything from a five-sou doll to a
menagere (the little cooking stove all
the peasant women use in their cot
tages). When we finally became al
most distracted with the confusion and
the crowd and our list, we asked the
boy what he had liked when he was 11
years old at school; and he assured us
all boys liked knives and guns. â From

silk, over which accordeon pleated mallnes In black is scantily draped.
Over this there are scattered at irregular intervals exquisite motifs of black
thread lace, In which the pattern Is picked out with tiny nacre (mother-of
pearl) spangles. The maline is cut away beneath the lace and a gold
spangled chiffon Inserted. The sleeves have huge, loose puffs of maline,
with the lace motifs at intervals, and the fitted cuff, that reaches almost to
the elbow, is entirely of lace over white chiffon. The fastening Is in the back,
thus leaving the fronts unbroken for decoration.

BURGLARS MAKE

v .
Operate in Richmond Dis
trict, Taking Advantage of
Lack of Police Protection
Criminals, taking advantage of the
lack of police protection, are continuing
operations In the Richmond district.
The latest crime reported to the de
partment involves an exciting night for
Mrs. Joseph Prince, who lives at 33
Twenty-first avenue, and a loss to her
husband of' $30 and some effects of
minor value.
Mr. Prince reported to the police that
last Tuesday night about 7 o'clock his
wife, who was alone in the house, was
startled by the loud ringing of the door
bell. She went to the front of the house
and on lighting the gas heard some one
run away. Later, she thinks about 11
o'clock, she beard hammering, as
though tome one was trying to force
an entrance to the basement. She was
greatly startled and was at a loss what
to do when her husband arrived.
She called to ftirn, warning him not to
go to the basement, saying a burglar
was there. Disregarding her fears, Mr.
Prince got a lantern and a revolver and
searched the building, but found no
one.
Wednesday afternoon Mrs. Prince left
her home to do some shopping. When
she returned that evening she found
that thieves had succeeded in their ef
fort'to loot the dwelling. Everything
had been ransacked in the search for
treasure, and even the carpets were
torn up by the burglars In search of
coin. From the condition of the din
ing-room It was plain that after steal-
Ing all they could find the thieves sat
down and enjoyed a repast.
There* is but one mounted policeman
in the whole district where the crime
occurred, and the people of Richmond
ask that they be given better protection
against burglars and petty thieves.

ON THE STAND
Doctor's Neglect Depicted
by Relative Who Advanced
Money to Girl's Husband
MOTHER ADMITS HATE
Mrs. Estes Says She Had Rea
sons for Strong Dislike.
Many Divorces Granted
The trial of the Kstes divorce case
was concluded before Judge Kerrigan
yesterday afternoon, then submitted
without argument. The principal wit
ness in behalf of the defendant, Myrtle
Scott Estes, was her aunt, Mrs. Ne
vada G. Baker, wife of E. Dexter Ba
ker, ranch owner and investor. Mrs.
Baker said that her niece was gentle,
kind and loving to Dr. Estes, and that
the latter was capable, brilliant and
gentlemanly when not under the in
fluence of morphine.
She told of the vicissitudes of the
young: couple, and said that the doctor
seldom, if ever, provided for his wife.
They had to leave their trunks at the
St. Nicholas Hotel in lieu of pay for
their beard. Mrs. Baker said that she
loaned Estes $80 with which to buy
office furniture and $15 to get his
clothes out of pawn. She declared that
at times Myrtle was almost starved
and so thin that it was pitiful to see
her.
Mrs. Wadsworth, daughter of Mrs.
Atkinson, manager of the sanitarium
on Sutter street, said that, Estes was
addicted to morphine and asked for a
dope when he was brought there for
treatment. She said the doctor's mother
would not pay for his treatment and
the wife could not afford it. Mrs. Ba
ker's story was corroborated by M. A.
French, grandfather of the chorus girl,
and Alex Vayssie, clerk of the Gray
stone. Edward Weller, clerk of the St.
Nicholas, and Mr. and Mrs. George S.
Stevenson, proprietors of the rooming
house at 625 Hyde street, . were called
to testify to facts in support of the
contention that Estes had lived with
his wife within the last year.
Mrs. Estes Sr. was called In rebuttal,
and declared that on the flates named
her son was always at home with her.
She admitted that she did not like her
wm's wife. The letter calling her a
"fiend" was admitted In evidence. .
Linda F. Klrchof, whose husband, F.
B. Kirchof, is a bookkeeper with a
salary of $100 a month and an income
of $1000 a year from property, yester
day sued him for $100 a month separate
maintenance. They were married In
1876, and he is said to have deserted
her five years ago.
Judge Sloss granted a divorce to Lll
lie Roe Luke from John Luke, a
plumber whom she married In 1SS5. He
was cruel, and one of his abuses was
to strike her with a hot soldering iron.
The wife was allowed $30 a month ali
mony and the custody of four chil
dren.
Others divorced were: By Judge Heb
bardâThomas M. Seavey from Cath
erine Seavey, cruelty; Francis A. Mc-
Laughlin from Sarah A. McLaughlin,
desertion; Edward Downs from Emma
Downs, desertion; Clara T. Wilmarth
from Charles Y. Wilmarth, desertion.
By Judge Seawell â To William . A.
Walkerly from Frances Walkerly, de
sertion; James E. Daves from Frances
Daves, desertion. By Judge Hunt â
To Elizabeth Hill from Edward C.
Hill, neglect; John C. Webster from
Cynthia E. Webster, desertion. By
Judge Kerrigan â To Henry C. Plaus
from Cornelie PlauB, Infidelity.
Suit for divorce was filed by Thomas
Jenkins against Christiana Jenkins,
whom he married in England in 1877.
She deserted him six years ago. George
Oberly asks for a legal separation from
his wife Augusta on the ground of
her cruelty, and Ferdlnando Rossi, a
restaurant man, wants a divorce from
his wife Maria because she struck him
and does not attend to her household
duties.

ARGUE LEGALITY
OF ADOPTION
Counsel in'Monnier Contest
Fight Legal Battle Over
Birthright of Contestant
LETTERS IN EVIDENCE
Uncomplimentary Epistles of
Young Husband About His
Wife Placed on Record
The. course of the Monnfer hearing
before Judge Graham yesterday was
suspended several- hours while the
counsel for both sides were lost in the
mazes of argument relative to the ad
mission of the adoption record signed
by George Monnier and Johannie Mon
nier before Judge Charles Halsey. The
direct examination of George Monnier
Jr. was concluded yesterday and the
only new evidence evolved was the ad
mission as evidence of several letters
written by Monnier to his mother,
In which he referred to his wife In
uncomplimentary terms and expressed
the hope that the annulment proceed
ings, then in course of trial, would be
successful.
Beside the usual record of the adop
tion of George Monnler'Jr., who was
at that time known as Charles D.
Dewey, the document recited "that the
father of said child Is not In tht said
city and county of San Francisco, and
has been absent therefrom for some
years, and his whereabouts Is un
known to the mother of said minor
child and to your petitioners."
George D. Collins, for the pro
ponent, Johanne Monnier, objected to
the admission of the adoption paper
on the ground that Judge Halsey had
no Jurisdiction. He argued that from
the face of the document the paternity
of the child was unknqwn to Monnier
Sr. and that the child was adopted
without the consent of its father,
which made the Instrument Invalid.
This ground was opposed by Matt Sul
livan, for the contestant, and Judge
Graham finally set aside this after
neon for a continuance of the hear
ing of the argument. Decision in the
matter will not be given befdre to
morrow morning at 10 o'clock, when
the case will be continued.
Mrs. Mary Reilly and Mrs. Mary. A.
Connell were placed on the stand by
the contestant to tell of conversations
with the elder Monnier, in which he
admitted that his wife was not the
mother of George Monnier, but that he
was the father. The court was com
pelled to issue an attachment for the
appearance of Mrs. Connell. It de
veloped In the testimony of the wit
ness that when she was served with
the subpena she asked her husband's
advice and was told not to appear.
When summoned again by telephone
Mrs. Connell observed that she thought
her husband's commands more bind
ing than the court order and was In
dignant at being compelled to attend.

OLYMPIC CLUB WRESTERS
PROVIDE EXCITING SPORT FOR LARGE GATHERING COMPOSED OF THE MEMBERS WHO
ENTHUSIASTICALLY APPLAUD EFFORTS OF SINEWY ATHLETES IN SPIRITED STRUGGLES
BIG WRESTLERS MEET
ON THE MAT TO-NIGHT
Buyayell and Jenkins Are Ready
for the Fray.
To-night's the ni^ht. The profes-
Fional wrestling game is to open here
agrain under the most favorable aus
pices. With the Hayes Valley Club at
the back of the enterprise. Billy Roche
to referee and two of the world's great
est on the mat the affair can hardly
fall short of a genuine revival of in
terest.
Buzaycll. the big Algerian, makes
his first American appearance this
evening in Woodward's Pavilion. For
weeks he has been exercising and is
as fit as trainer's skill can make him.
Fifteen pounds, mostly from the waist
line, have melted under rigorous hand
ling and he will strip as well as any
athlete who ever showed here. Buzayell j
has done most of his wrestling on the
Continent and has thrown the best pro
ductions of France, Denmark, Ger
many ar.d Russia. His career in this
country de;>ends on his work to-night
and he knows it. Should he win he
will be great; should be give Tom
Jenkins a hard tussle, which he appears
certain to do, his name and fame will
rpread froii ocean to ocean.
Every c e who reads the papers j
knows of Tom Jenkins, the Cleveland j
rolling mill man. No harder game has I
ever been on the mat. If there was
public betting on the Jenkins !
would be favorite on account of his im- j
mt-nse strength and honorable record.
But such a keen judge as Jack Carkeek
predicts that Jenkins must be at his
very best to win and looks for a tre
mendous tussle.
George Braun. the Olympic Club's
best lightweight, will have Charles
Davis of New York as an opponent in
the preliminary. Catch-as-catch-can.
rules govern this contest while the main
event will be waged at Graeco-Roman.
Popular prices will be in vogue.

LADIES WATCH
THE WRESTLERS
Prove Interested Spectators
of Exciting Sport in the
Olympic Club Gymnasium
The gymnasium of the Olympic Club
was thronged to its capacity last night,
the attraction being seven matches In
catch-as-catch-can wrestling. As a
special mark of favor ladies were per
mitted to attend and they availed of
the opportunity to see the struggle on
the mat In large numbers. Their gowns
of bright hues gave an unusual setting
for the athletic contests.
They displayed the keenest interest
and always joined in the applause
when one of the contestants wriggled
out of a particularly tight place. There
was occasionally an involuntary excla
mation of "Oh! you mean thing!" when
some one used rough tactics.
The band of the Columbia Park
Boys' Club rendered several selections
during the evening.
The bouts between Charles Jenkins
and A. A. Pockwitz and Marion Veckl
and John Simpson were the best of the
series. The wrestlers were clever In
getting in and out of holds and in
breaking all locks. Jenkins was twice
saved a fall by the ropes of the ring.
They showed the effects of Professor
Miehling's coaching and of Roger Cor
nell's training.
â¢The most sensational victory of the
night was that in which G. J. Anloff
secured a flying fall over Herbert Dun
can from a cross buttock hold. Neither
had gone to the mat until the fall
came after 6 minutes and 45 seconds
of severe work. The results in detail:
J. P. Parker defeated G. S. Kroger after
b^ing thrown in the first bout In 2:28. Parker
won in 10:00 and in %:15.
H. G. Miller threw E. Baraty in 8:20 and
was thrown in :45. The deciding bout will be
hÂ£14 at some future time.
R. B. Barnfy threw E. H. Vannler in :45
and in 1 :01.
CT.arles Jenkins won from A. A. Pockwitz
in 10:00 and in S:35.

GARDNER DEFEATS O'KEEFE.
Tlie Lotter*s Seconds Throw Up the
Sponge In, Twelfth Round.
, BUTTE, Mont, Dec. 15. â Jimmy
Qardner of Lowell, Mass., defeated
Jack O'Keefe of .Chicago here to-night
in eleven rounds. - When the gong
sounded for the twelfth round
O'Keefe's seconds threw up the
sponge. After the first round Gard
ner showed his. superiority by landing
vicious rights and lefts frequently to
O'Keefe's wind, body, and face.. .In
the seventh round O'Keefe was smear
ed-with blood, which came from an
ugrly cut tin his under lip. In. this
round both men rushed into the mljl
and at the end were noticeably weak.
' In the eighth round O'Keefe, who
was handicapped by a disabled left
hip which was thrown out In . the
fourth round, landed some .effective
body, punches. '.-
In the tenth round Gardner landed
on O'Keefe's wind with his left and
swun? to the jaw with the "right.

STROLLER FOOLS HIS STABLE FOLLOWING
Defeats the Heavily
Played Venator
Galloping.
Dr. Leggo Too Speedy
for the Favorite,
Sea Air.
BY FRED E. MULHOLLAXD.
There's nothing like having a. good
line on one's own horse. So soliloquised
Wally Brinkwcrth and the Junior
members of the firm of Brinkworth &
Co. after Stroller had waltzed in win
ner of the fourth selection on the score
card yesterday at Oakland.
-It was a high-class six-furlong sell
ing fixture, and Venator received such
steady and consistent support at short
odds that a Senator from the up
country portion of the State would
be inclined to think Dr. Rowell's
sprinter had been nominated by ac
clamation. But it was not to.be so,
even with Padua, Sea Voyage and
Saggittarius acting as Havana-fillers.
A dead pigeon will sometimes fall out-
Bide of bounds.
. STROLLER SHOWS SPEED.
Stroller, with Sain Greenfield at the
tiller, which failed so lamentably when
backed on Tuesday, had on his running
clothes. He outfooted Venator every
inch of the journey, winning with his
head in the air and ears pricked, just
as if it were a wowout. The winner's
odds went from 6 to 12 to 1. Nigrette
ran third.
The condition of the track is improv
ing rapidly, and by to-morrow will be
good.
Favorites again found- the road a
rocky one, Idoi?o being the only one
tÂ« earn brackets. The attendance was
large. â¢
Helgesen landed the opening Futur
ity course sprint for two-year-olds
with Edrodun, an 3 to 1 outsider, beat
ing Edgecliff a head. The blonde rider
got the son of Eddie Jones away in
front and his strong finish at the close
enabled him to get the decision. Meada,
the favorite, nosed Herthus out' of
show honors. â¢ . -
Revolt, also ridden by Helgesen, cap
tured the six and a half furlong selling
number from a big field. The mare's
odds were played down from 6 to 5% to
LA She toyed with the bunch, winning
all the way. Knapp brought Lady
Kent from the rear, downing the 100 to
1 shot, Maud Muller, almost two
lengths for the place. Lloyd Fountain
appeared unable to make Doublet, the
favorite, extend himself. *
McCAFFERTY'S COLORS SHOW.
Charley McCafferty's colors were
strongly in evidence in the mila-and fif
ty-yard selling affair, with an even
dozen starters facing the barrier. His
brown gelding. Idogo with Apprentice
Tayloc in the saddle, went out and sim
ply spreadeagled the field, breezing
home three lengths in advance of Lang
ford James, a slightly nibbled at out
sider.
San Lution. the second choice, fin
ished third. The winner ruled a slight
favorite at Dost time.
Likewise in the fifth, a five and a half
furlong spin for two-year-olds, were
the McCafferty colors conspicuous. Dr.
Leggo, the second choice, with Solomon
Bonner up, passed the others in the
stretch as if they had been tied to
hitching posts, beatinr- out Sea Air, the
favorite, four lengths. Prince Brutus
made hfs first appearance at the meet
ing, showing speed and running a good
third. Arisbe was not' ready.
Tracers finally got aboard a winner,
taking the closing mile selling fixture
with the 8 to 1 shot, Dusty Miller. The
coit was unquestionably the best, for h*
stood a long drive, moving along from
eighth place, beating Meistersinger half
a length. Red Damsel, the favorite, af
ter a most uneven and tempestuous
voyage, finally anchored third.
Track Notes.
Dr. Rowell will offer the 3-year-old
Hugh McGowan at public auction in
the paddock at 1 o'clock to-morrow.
"Kansas" ,Price purchased Padua
from Molera & Josephs yesterday, and
ho carried the former's colors in the
fourth event, i, v\ i â >;; ;^^
Helgesen piloted the first two win
ners. The blonde rider has quite an ex
tended following and is riding In ex
cellent form.
Charley McCafferty's good colt. Dr.
Leggo> was bred at Napa Stock Farm.
His siM Puryear D. is now owned by
"White Hat" McCarty.
There was a wild plunge on Bob Mc-
Lean to win the second event. Bob
showed nothing In the race to warrant
the 'scare.
When Paddy Lynch stumbled and
fell about . three-sixteenths of a mile
from the stand, Anderson, who rode
Sweet Kitty Bellairs, had ample time
to miss the fallen horse. He must have
been riding , with his .eyes closed
though, for he rode right over- Paddy
Lynch and Jockey Sherwood. When
the filly went down Anderson' received
a severe shaking up and was taken to
Fabinola Hospital for treatment.
â  The rich Crocker selling stakes with
$2000 added by the association will be
the special attraction offered race
goers to-morrow. ;
.While a ' very ragged assortment to
handle. Dick Dwyer released the bar
rier to a very pretty start In the last
event. Red Damsel Is a notoriously
bad actor and should be schooled with
a' fence rail, crowbar and double bar
reled shotgun.

CROWDS FIGHT
FOR ADMISSION
Jimmy Britt's Gymnasium Is
the Scene of a Few Lively
Mix-Ups Between Fans
WORKS LIKE A BEAYER
Plumber Boy Increases His
Boxing Bout With Frank
Rafael to Six Rounds
The hardest work at Camp Brltt is
keeping the anxious sightseers at a safe
distance. They gather at the Seal Rock
House In bunches running all the way
from three to three hundred, and, as
usual, they are all friends of Jimmy
and, positively insist on breaking into
the "exclusive inner circle. A regular
bombardment comes off every after
noon at the foot of the stairs, where the
fight for admission always waxes hot.
Nearly every 6port who follows the
game of fisticuffs was on the spot yes
terday. They are all anxious to get a
line on the plumber lad and see for
themselves how he j looms up. He
worked to the satisfaction of every one,
and the general opinion was that James
is stronger and faster at the present
time than he ever was In his life be
fore. â¢ â¢
He Increased his boxing bout with
Frank Rafael to six rounds, and the
mill took a fast turn toward the- close.
The start was slow and cautious, but
when Brltt's fighting blood began to
course more, freely through his veins
he kept coming. Rights and lefts were
jammed into Rafael's face and body in
quick succession, and the latter was on
the point of seeking rest when "Spider"
Kelly called time In the last two rounds.
The bout with Krellng was equally
fast and spirited. The pair tugged with
each other for five minutes without a
let-up. It was here the native son
showed a lot of strength and speed.
After going through all these -heavy
stunts his. wind was perfect and he
conversed with his friends as easily as
though he had been entertaining the
gang at a pink tea Instead of pummel
ing everything in sight for an hour.
Brother Willis limped around with a
cane and spoke hopefully to those pres
ent. Willis tried to take charge of the
mob at the foot of the stairs, and being
a cripple at present fared badly. He i
was nearly "rough housed" before the j
crowd was through with him. The I
"Spider," as usual, acted as master of
ceremonies and general overseer.
/ The plumber boy will begin to think
of getting the two extra pounds off in
a couple of days now, though he pro
fesses to be In no hurry about this for
mality. If he works as fast as he did
yesterday there is no danger that the
weight will stay with him long. It was
unusually warm at the beach yester
day, and in the gymnasium the atmos
phere was oppressive on account of the
big crowd present.
The advance sale of seats for the â¢
fight will open this morning at Harry j
Corbett's. The promoters are figuring
on a $30,000. house, and expect the first
few days of the sale will yield a small
sized fortune.
Mayor Lynch, the venerable ruler of
Larkspur and better known as "the
poet of Baltimore Canyon," has spoken.
For many years the old sage has pick- [
ed the winners of the prize ring con- ;
tests, and Battling Nelson and his
training mates have anxiously wait
ed for the old gentleman to express an (
opinion. Yesterday afternoon before j
the gym work commenced Battling re
ceived a poem from the Mayor, in
which he picks Bat to win the battle
in about fourteen rounds. '
After reading the Mayor's poem Bat
donned his gym suit and went to work
with a will. An hour's hard work fol
lowed, and when "Rawhide" Kelly
donned the gloves there was something
doing. The pair went at It hammer
and tongs; but the pace was too much
fcr Rawhide, who quit.' A couple

Magnates of the Pacific
Coast League Gather in
Regular Annual Session
TACOMA GETS PENNANT
Admission Price Is Raised
and Spokane's 'Petition Is
Quickly Turned Down
The annual session of the magnates
of the Pacific Coast Baseball League
opened last night. The following cities
were represented: San Francisco by-
Henry Harris, Los Angeles by James
F. Morley, Oakland by J. Cal Ewing;
Seattle by F. S. Stinson. J. P. Agnew
ar.d Russell Hall; Portland by Juage
W. W. McCreedle, Walter McCreedie
and Ben Ely; Tacoma by M. A. Fisher
and David Evans. Eugene F. Bert was
re-elected president. Judge McCreedla
was chosen vice president, James H.
Anderson . secretary, and Theodore
Goodman treasurer.
It was decided to raise the price of
admission to 35 cents with an addi
tional charge of 25 cents for reserved
seats. C. H. Williams, president of the
Spokane team, applied for admission
to the league, but the application was
turned down. A. Joy of Fresno, repre
senting the business men of that town
and of San Jose, applied for admission
for the t-.vo cities in case Spokane was
admitted. Fresno and San Jose agreed
to divide the games between them and
put up a guarantee with the treasurer
of the league. These applications
were also sidetracked.
Tacoma was officially awarded th<Â»
pennant for the season just closed. The
umpires will be appointed by the presi
dent as heretofore. Among those who
have applied for position are Jack
Sheridan, Jim McDonald, Fred Perine.
Arlle Latham, Gus Klopf. Jack Has
kell, Fred Pears and Ira Davis. It wa3
agreed that each manager may carry
as many players as he likes till June
1 when the number will be restricted to
fourteen. ~"A fine of $250 for each day
an extra player is carried will then be
levied.
Every man who signs with^ the
league must have his legal release. ThÂ«
barrier is down for alleged Jumpers and
any man recognized in organized base
ball may play in the league. The
double season was again adopted, the
winners of each half to meet in a post
senson series of nine games in cities
to be agrreed upon by the managers of
the teams. All protests must be set
tled within fifteen days from the timt*
they are filed with the president. Henry
Harris was appointed a committee of
one to secure baseballs for the league.
The magnates will resume their ses
sion this afternoon at 1 o'clock.

IS BEACHED TO PREVENT SINKING.

Oi the Incorriing
Grace Dollar.
Collision Occurs in the
Darkness of Early
iMoniiiig.
The river st*?an:er St. Helena, bound
for Napa. tried to cross the bows of
4he Inward bound stram<*rX3racc Dol-
Isr early jresterday morninj? off Lom
bard-strcet wharf and was cut nearly
in half. The SU Helena reached a
mud bank south of the Pacific Mail
wharf just in time to save herself
from sinking. Nobody was injured
#nd the damage to the Grace Dollar
was nominal.
The St. Helena, with twenty-five
pasreengrrs on board, left the foot of
.Mission street at 2 o'clock and was
off Lombard-street wharf when the
collision occurred. The morning was
dark and The weather thick. The St.
Helena had taken a course close in
to the wharves and â¢was starting
across *ne bay, headed for the river,
.-when the Grace Dollar, coming In
from Gray? Harbor, appeared on the
ecen*Â». E*ch vessel v.as under good
hiadway ana although whistles were
blown and oruers shouted the danger
had been recojmSzed too late to be
fcvoided. The Dollar struck the SL
Helena squarely on the port Fide,
*bout amidships. The Dollar's shartf
Ftem cut like a knife through the
river host's guard and kept digging
into the St. Helena's vitals until a tri
angular impression, four or five feet
deep, had been made in the victim's
cide. The flimsy superstructure of
The .SL Helena was cracked like an
t-es shell and the break extended far
beioiv ihe water line. .
The Gracs Dollar stood by the St.
Helena until the damaged vessel was
s^fe on. the mud. The river boat was
able to use her engines. She was tied
up at a litUe wharf south of the Pa
cific Mail dock, where her passengers
â vcre landed. The blame for the col
lision will be fixed by the -United
States inspectors, who will make an
investigation in a few days.

MARSHFIELD, Or., Dec. 15. â The
Drain stage which arrived here to-day
reports the schooner Lucy, from San
Pedro, ashore on the Umpqua Bar.
Finding r.o towboat at the mouth of
the Umpqua to tow her, the Lucy at
tempted to sail over the bar. It ap
pears that the channel had shifted
since Captain Peterson, the master of
the Lucy, left the Umpqua on her pre
vious trip. Captain Peterson attempt
ed .to turn, but his ship ran hard an'd
fast on the south spit before he was
able to bring her about. She struck
late yesterday, afternoon. The sea is
quJetlnj; down, and Captain Peterson
thinks that- if he gets immediate as
sistance he will be able to float his
ship, otherwise she will go to pieces.
The crew was at no time in danger and
reached shore safely.
COWDES WILIj COACH
STANFORD BASEDBALIi MEN
Ex-Captain of the Cardinals - Is Ex

With the Team,
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Dec. 15.
David V. Cowden, a graduate of 1903,
was chosen by the excutlve committee
of the Associated Students last night
to coach the Stanford baseball team
during the coming season. Cowden is
an old Stanford ballplayer, and a thor
ough student of the game. â¢ He played
on -the varsity for four consecutive
years, captaining the nine in 1902.
The choosing of Cowden for baseball
coach marks a change in that branch
of athletics at Stanford. In former
years professional league players were
secured as coaches, but with the suc
cess of the graduate system in football
came the Idea that professional coach-
Ing In every branch of athletics be
eliminated. . . . â¢
Says Howard Is a Defaulter.
L. E. Chapin of New York, who is
connected with the American Press
Association, swore to a complaint be
fore Police Judge Conlan yesterday
charging Robert C. Howard, the resi
dent manager of the association, with
offices at 207 Sacramento street, with
felony embezzlement. Suspicion was
aroused that something was wrong
with. Howard's accounts and Chapin
was sent from New York to investi
gate. The complaint alleges that on
November 28 Howard drew a check
for 170 on the Wells-Fargo Bank and
pocketed the amount instead of ap
plying it to the needs of the associa
tion. It is said there are other amounts
unaccounted for.
Arrests Unwilling Witness.
. Elkis Kohn, who purchased a gold
brick from Max Gutter, was so loth
to appear againjst the vendor that
Judge Cabanlss issued a -bench war
rant for. his arrest. Detective Bun
ner, who was sent out to find the un
willing witness, had considerable dif
ficulty in getting him.- He finally dis
covered Kohn in hiding at his home
last night and placed him under ar
rest. The bail Is fixed at $500.

remains have been In a. vault for at
least thirty"days v The ordinance is de
signed to prevent the concealment of
possible crime by tlte incineration of
the body.
The Health Officer was directed to
present amendments of the present
anti-expectoration ordinance to the
Board of Supervisors and also to send
JLo every glove store a copy of a reso
lution reciting that it is unsanitary for
sales persons in fitting- on gloves to
moisten the fingers by their saliva. It is
urged that a sponge be used to prevent
the possible spread of disease germs.
The board also recommended the
passage of ordinances prohibiting the
beating or shaking of carpets, gar
nionts or bedding near any inhabited
building between the hours of 12 and
S a. m. unless adequate precaution i?
taken to prevent the flying of dust
particles; making it unlawful to ex
pose for sale any candy, grapes or
other foodstuffs unless they be pro
tected against dust and flies; providing
that no work shall be dons on build
ings unless precaution is taken to pre
vent the fragments of lime and mortar
from being- blown upon the street, and
providing that garbage shall only be
' gathered between the hours of 6 p. m.
'and 7 a. m. An , the ordinances ' are
designed to 'stop the spread of disease.
The board set December 29 for a
hearing on the proposed vacation of
alleged unsanitary premises at 2029
Fifteenth street, a stable at 2037 Fif
teenth street' and a stable at 515-51?
Green street.
The cellars at 816 to 820. 828, 836
and 838" Sacramento street were con
demned and ordered destroyed.
PROHIBITS THE KEEPING
OF SYVIXE IX CITY LIMITS
Supervisors' Health Committee Rec
.. onunetuls Exception of Bntcher
\ town From Restriction.
The Supervisors' Health and Hospi
tal Committee yesterday recommended
the amendment of ordinance 79?" so
as to prohibit the keepinjc of swine
within the limits of the city and coun-.
ty, excepting within the Butchertown
district. Action was taken on con
tinued protests filed by residents and
property owners in the vicinity of hos
ranches, who claimed that they were
nuieances and a hindrance to improve
ments in residence districts. The limits
within which it has been unlawful- to
keep swine have been extended several
times and the committee felt that the
time had now arrived. to eliminate the
objectionable feature from all portions
of the citv except in Butchertown.
where the slaughtering is done.
The commi'.'.'e also recommended
the passage of an ordinance prohibit*
ing the conveyance of bread, cakes
and pastry through the public streets
in open baskets or exposed containers.
Petitions were filed by the Thomas
Sanatorium and the Claxa Barton Hos
pital for permits to maintain private
hospitals, but were withdrawn, as the
Health Board alone has power In the
premises.
The zebra is born with â trrpes; man

WOMAN BLAMES WOMAN FOR
TRAINING HER TO STEAL
Mrs. Bertha Campbell, Alias Allen,
Makes a Full Confession to Police
of. Shoplifting Experieqce.
Through the confession of Mrs.
Bertha Campbell, alias Allen, the po
lice are in posession of facts showing
that she and Mrs. Lizzie Pierce, alias
Jackson, had planned to carry on a
systematic plan of shoplifting in de
partment stores during the holiday
season. Both women were arrested on
Wednesday by Detectives Ryan and
Wolters and about $200 worth of goods
stolen from the Emporium and Prag
er's store and from stores in Oakland
have been recovered by the officers.
Mrs. Campbell told Captain Burnett
yesterday that Mrs. Pierce met her
about six weeks ago and explained to
her how easy it would be to steal from
stores. Mrs. Campbell was induced to
go along on thieving trips so as to get
a thorough training. She declared
that prior to that time she had been
innocent of any wrongdoing. The de
tectives are still working on the case.
Mrs. Pierce, alias Jackson, -is the
wife of Robert Jackson, alias "the
Sheeny Kid," a well-known bunko
steerer. H. S. Hocks?, the man who
called to see her at the City Prison on
Wednesday night and was. placed un
der arrest, was discharged from cus
tody yesterday after he had been
shown to the police.
The police last night arrested L. C.
Robinson and Joseph Maystaff and
wife, who were mentioned by* Mrs.
Campbell, or Allen, in her confession.
The prisoners will be closely ques
tioned relative to their acquaintance
with the Campbell and Pierce women.

ment. The execution of Buckley was

â vTH EATâ Foreign futures were weaker.
Chicago was higher. This market was . firm
but quiet, with the cash grain unchanged and
futures somewhat higher.
The Chicago Record-Herald says: "English
grain dealers say there is no possibility of the
United States ever doing an expert trade In
I Wheat with them again. They are getting all
the Wheat they want from Russia the River
Flatte, Argentina and India." Said C. F.
Hately: "They are now being simply over
whelmed with Wheat from other â  countries.
! The Russian Wheat ts excellent. Is generally
softer than ours, but not as well liked. Xatur
ally the millers are doing a big business and
alt are making money. We will not be able
to do much ln a speculative way in Wheat
with any of the foreigners. They are afraid
of -our markets and see the possibility of much
higher prices here through manipulation and
because of the small proportion of good quality
â  of Wheat here." . , .

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. DECEMBER 16. 1904
LARGE FAMILY
OF COLORED COACHMAN
HELPS HIM TO LIBERTY
Arrested for Invading His Mother
in-Law's Boarding-House/
Domestic Burden Is Heavy
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
James Floyd, a middle-aged Afro-
American," respectably garbed and def
erential of manner, pleaded that he had
imbibed to intoxication before he vis
ited the house of his mother-in-law.
Mrs. Quinn, at 10 Burgoyne street, and
drove her boarders fromÂ»ihelr beds and
to the street, where 'they shivered in
various stages of dishabille while he
addressed them from a second-story
window and emphasized his remarks
by thumping the wall with a club. He
did not censure Patrolman E. C. Marsh
for effecting his incarceration, but he
hoped Police Judge Mogan would take
his record into consideration with his
first arrest.
"Fo' twenty-two yeahs, sah." said
Mr. Floyd, "Ah've bin wukkin' ez
coachman fo' M ssee Baird ob de Pal
ace Hotel, an' mah wife an' sebben
chilluns '11 be mighty bad erflicted ef
Ah goes teh jail fo' any ixtended peh
ylod ob time. Eet's, mah first offense,
yo' Honnah, fo' Ah nebbah got drunk
afoah, an' teh sabe mah life Ah kaint
ermaginate w'y de spirit moved me teh
drink las' night. Mah wife's muddah,
MIssee Qulnn, am er nice lady, an' so
am 'er sistah. Missee Harris, ez libs
nex' doah, an' it jes* beats me. Jedre.
teh diskivah w'y Ah goes an' pehsicutes
dem yah wimmin folk."
The policeman said that when he ar
rived on the scene, at 3 o'clock a. m.,
Mr. Floyd was evidently laboring under
the delusion that the half-clad persons
in the street were awaiting opportunity
to visit him with personal violence, the
fact being that they were just as eager
to avoid him as he was reluctant to get
closer to them. .
"Please doan fo'git dat wife an' seb
ben chilluns, Jedge'" the defendant be
seeched the court, and the reminder
probably had something to with the
order of dismissal.
Herman Schonling's noiseless ap
proach to the bench of Judge Conlan
attracted attention to his footgear,
which consisted of Chinese slippers.
The remainder of his apparel was
variegated of style, texture and age.
and jarred with the Idea of opulence
conveyed by the charge that he had as
saulted a person who owed him rent
for an apartment at Seventh and Fol
som streets. The accusation, if not the
ownership of the apartment, was
proved, and Mr. Schonling will be sen
tenced to-day for peace disturbance.
Miss Sophie Morris averred that her
mother's death was speedily followed
by family discord, that culminated in
the "railroading" of her to the Agnew
asylum by her brother-in-law, Hugh
Hughes, she being: entirely sane at the
time, as was proved by her almost im
mediate release from the institution for
lunatics.- When she returned to the
family dwelling. 3266 Mission street, she
further averred, Mr. Hughes violently
cast her forth, and that's why she had
him arrested.
Mr. .Hughes then informed Judge
Fritz that Miss Morris* complaint was
foundationed In falsehood and propped
by fabrication. For years, he said, she
had been the bane of his life, and was
endured only because she was his wife's
sister. She had been'placed by him in
the Magdalen Asylum with a view to
reforming her general character, but
the experiment was a failure. As for
the "railroading" charge, , that was
bosh. True, he ejected her from the
house when she returned from Agnew
and demanded Â£hat he be, given its
exclusive possession, but he put her out
because she was intoxicated, and in so
doing he did not use unnecessary vio
lence.
" The case is under advisement.
â¢ â¢ â¢ t
Emillo Santos declared, with panto
mimic accompaniment more Intelligible
than his mutilated English, that he did
not disturb the peace of Luigi Canti
ello's restaurant In Hinckley alley, until
he was amply justified in doing so.
After he had distinctly ordered open
face cranberry pie, he explained, Signor
Cantlellb laid before him a' pie with
pastry trelliswork top, and In the ensu
ing argument as to whether such a pie
could technically be termed open-face
Signor Cantiello, for the affirmative,
lost his temper and closed the discus
sion by pushing the upper side of the
subject of debate against his opponent's
face, thus provoking him to break the
peace and several dishes. Judge Mogan
has the case and the crushed pie under
advisement till to-morrow.
James Fitzgerald, accused of robbing
telephone cash boxes, was remanded to
the Superior Court r by Judge Conlan,
with bail fixed at $1000.
William jj Nesbltt, , alias "Slocksey
Bill," stole three bottles of milk from
a Vallejo-street* doorway, and Judge
Conlan gave him six months for it.
Since he was tried for murder and ac
quitted, about twenty years ago, Mr.
Nesbitt has ! spent about three-fourths
of his time in prison, his recorded of
fenses ranging in seriousness from
street-begging to grand larceny.
James Beattle, who narrowly escaped
the fate dealt to Joseph â¢ McGowan by
Joseph Smith on November ?6, repeated
before Judge Mogan the ; narrative of
the shooting which. he, recounted, to the
Coroner's .Jury. .After, -killing ' Mc-
Gowan, Beattie testified. Smith tried
to shoot him, but he managed. to keep
out of range of the shotgun by crouch
ing and crawling over a pile of lumber,
Smith pursuing him. It was Beattle
who telephoned tc#the police that mur
der had been done. The hearins: will be
resumed this morning.
Mollie Fay, another oft-jailed misde
meanant, wept in protest when Judge
Fritz sentenced her to thirty days for
drunkenness.^ She spent the last nine
Christmases in prison, she said, and
every time she is released the chansre of
atmospheric temperature visits upon
her a severe cold, which unlearned po
ilicemen mistake for achollsm.
' While the attention of the Judee and
the Prosecuting Attorney was tempo
rarily distracted by an applicant for a
warrant the pleader for the defense
lowered his voice and said to the in
telligent jury:
"By looking at this poor girl, gentle
men, you will see' that it would be
scarcely short of inhuman to send her
to jail, so frajjile is she physically, to
say. nothing, of subjecting her youth
and inexperience to the prison contam
ination. The Judge and the attorney
for the prosecution will advise you to
return a verdict in accordance with
the law and the evidence, but. gentle
men, we who have wives or sisters or
female relatives of any kind know how
little such advice as that weighs when
pitted against manly sympathy for
distressed womanhood."
The Judge and the Prosecuting Attor
ney did as predicted, but the intelli
gent jury spent not more than three
minutes in deciding that Jane Doe was
not guilty of vagrancy. Then one of
the intelligent borrowed a quarter of a
dollar from the attorney for the de
fense and proceeded to invest the same
in Hauefied stock.
George Smith and Joseph Ganzolla,
19-year-olds, who stole a roll of line<*
leum and were arrested while trying to
sell their plunder, were sent up for six
months apiece by Judge Mogan.
Peter Henretty, accused of failing to
provide for two minor children, ad
vanced the unique plea that inability
to find his little ones and their mater
nal guardian was responsible for their
deprivation of life's necessaries. His
wife spent for drink all the money he
gave ' her, he explained, and In the
spending she absented herself and the
children, from home, so that for a week
at a time he has been unaware of their
whereabout*. Judge Mogan Instructed
Mr. Henretty to. cease providing his
helpmeet with means of indulging her
bibulous ? penchant and. to pay into
court sufficient money ' to support his
unfortunate 'offspring, said payment to
be made weekly. .
- A proud commander was Police Ser
geant Williams as he strutted alongside
his squad early yesterday morning on
Kearny street. He felt that the admlr-
ing glances bestowed by passing citi
zens were no more than due the ten
stalwarts and the man who lÂ«jd them,
for he was ready to wager his silver
star against a celluloid collar button
that the finest- military company on
earth could not put up a more impres
sive physical appearance or march
with greater- precision. If his spirit had
been less exalted," perhaps, the derisive
comments uttered by" Private â William
Keith, United States artillery, would
have conveyed lesser shock.
Private Keith had spent the night
in Barbary Coast places of public en
tertainment, and was unsteadily
propped against a lamp post at Com
mercial street when the t flower of 'the
force paraded past him. '
'"Wot's dis I sees?" he , loudly ex
claimed. "Is it de Home for Aged an'
Infirm Cripples out for an alrln'? Dress
up, ye stiffs, an' try ter stop kickin 1
each odder's heels. Gee! .I'd like ter
have youse at de Preseedeo. Hay foot,
straw foot, hay foot, straw foot â dat's
de way ter â " .' v
As one man, the squad fell upon him,
and two members of it were detailed by
the enraged, sergeant to book hitn for
disturbing the peace.
"I dunno why I done It," he said to
Judge Fritz, "an' I don't remember do
in' It." .
When he pleaded that his incarcera
tion would deprive one of Uncle Sam's
thirteen-lnch ' guns of lovingr' care his
dismissal was ordered.
Two Sets of Directors.
; An application was made to the Su
perior Court yesterday for a writ of
mandate compelling H. D. Ulrichs,
Martin H. Ulrichs and Rebecca Ul
richs, former omcers and directors of'
the Columbia Brewing 'â , Company,' to
admit August F. Meyer, Joseph P.
Coffey and Henry. Tietjen to the of
fices the defendants now hold. The
trouble has grown out of the refusal
of the defendants to attend , a stock
holders' ( meeting or abide by the re
sults pf an election held on. December
6. On May 9 a stockholders' meet-
Ing was called by the Ulrichses, which
they attended,' buta majority of the
stock was not represented. Since then
they â have refused r to call another
meeting. ,The: other stockholders de
manded a meeting.'but the Ulrichses
refused. . .Then the . majority ; had: a
meeting, at which new -directors were
elected., Meyer was ; made president
and "treasurer, 1 Tietjen vice : president
and Coffey secretary. .
LETCHER WRIT
NOT GRANTED
Judge Cook Finally Holds
Governors Warrant of
Rendition Correctly Issued
MUST GO BACK TO OHIO
Notice Is Given That the
v Case TVill Now Be Carried
Before , the Supreme Court
Judge Cook has decided that George
E. Letcher of San Jose must go \p Ohio
to answer the charge that he commit
ted arson in that State on January 4,
1881. The case has 'been taken before
the Supreme Court for final judgment.
When the application for the writ of
habeas corpus . for Letcher's discharge
came up* before Judge uook yesterday
the court held that no proof had been
offered to him that the statutes of Ohio
laid before him were the statutes of
Ohio or had been accepted in the courts
of that State. That proof may have
been offered to the Governor before he
issued his warrant, but it had not been
offered to the court. He could only act
therefore in accordance with tire rule
laid down,' by the Supreme Court that
where no proof is offered of the laws of
another . State they will be. presumed
to be the same as the laws of this
State.
Attorney , C: C. Nagle offered in evi
dence the statutes of the State of Ohio.
"I am not an attorney in this case,"
said the Judge, "and it is not for me to
direct the attorney on either side. If
counsel on each side will admit that
these are the statutes I am prepared to
decide the. case. Under t-fce laws ot this
State there . is no statute that would
meet this indictment.";
Nagle called Garrett Fox, the officer
from Ohio, who came to take Letcher
back to the stand, but after question
ing him he could not throw any definite
light on the matter of the statutes.
Nagle looked puzzled and the Judge
said there was enly one way under the
code to offer proof as to statutes.
Finally in desperation he said that the
statutes offered were aaieged to have
been printed in 1890, several years after
the date of the alleged crime. What he
wanted was the statutes prior to 1881.
He gave Nagle till 3 o'clock In the
afternoon to get his proof. At that
hour Nagle offered the statutes of 1880,
which were certified to as correct by
the Secretary of State.
The Judge held that the proof was
sullicient. Then in an elaborate opin
ion he held that all the requirements
had been complied with by the Gov
ernor of Ohio and that the warrant of
rendition by Governor Pardee was cor
rectly issued. The prisoner was ordered
remanded to be taken to the State of
Ohio.
Petition for a writ of habeas cor
pus was filed with the State Supreme
Court yesterday afternoon. Attorneys
D. W. Burchard, Samuel Tompklns
and John B. Kerwin appeared for the
petitioner. The writ is returnable this
morning at 10 o'clock. The petitioner
sets forth that the requisition for his
removal to Ohio was not in proper
legal form and was not accompanied
by an affidavit specifying the crime
and showing that he had ever fled
from the State of Ohio. Section 95
of the Revised Statutes of Ohio shows
that the Governor shall send sworn
evidence to the Governor of anojther
State when . requisition is demanded.
The certificate .of the Governor is said
to recite "that it is represented to me
that George E. Letcher is a fugitive
from justice." Attention is called j to
the law that requires that the Gover
nor of a State issuing a warrant must
have before him a certifled^copy of the
indictment detailing the crime com
mitted. , Mrs. Letcher accompanied
her husband to the court and was
much overcome by the nervous strain
to which she was subjected during the
presenting of the petition.

FARWELL GIVES
INDIAN MUSIC
WITH SUCCESS
A distinguished little audience gath
ered at Lyric Hall last night to hear
the concert of American compositions
given by Arthur Farwell and his as
sociates ai^d was amply rewarded by
the quaint and beautiful programme
offered. Mr. Farwell repeated the com
positions given so successfully on Tues
day evening at Century Hall, his In
dian melodies for violin and piano. In
which he was again accompanied by
Miss Hulda Andersen, and the piano
compositions, "Dawn" and "The Domain
of Hurakan." An extremely Interest
ins pair of Zuni songs by Professor
Carlos Troyer were sung by Miss Helen
Colburn Heath, who was accompanied
by Professor Troyer. The songs were
tho "Sunrise Call" and "The Coming
of Montezuma," both rarely pictur
esque and sung in dramatic and sym
pathetic fashion by Miss Heath.
The other numbers were "A Negro
Episode," by. Henry F. Gilbert, a so
prano solo, "Israfel."by Edgar S. Kel
ley, and a composition for reader, so
prano, piano and. violin, "In the Moon
Shower," by Harvey W. Loomis, . In
which Dr. J. Wilson Shiels appeared
as the reader. The whole programme
was enjoyable and heartily enjoyed.
