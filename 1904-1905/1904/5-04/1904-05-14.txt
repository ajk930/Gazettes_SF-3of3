the robbery she said:
"I am deeply shocked to think that
this Jewel theft has got into the news

the trunk at Cherbourg over night and
received it the nsxt day. It was passed
unopened by the customs officials. That
night I left it in a corridor of the hofel
outside my door. In the morning I had
occasion to use my thimble and opened
the truak to get it. It was then I dis
covered that the Jewels and all of my
valuables were gone."
The gems were stolen, from a trunk
and are supposed to have -been taken
from it either at the St. Lazarre rail

NEW YORK,. May 13.â It was de
cided in the -Essex County Circuit
Court in NewarkV to-day that a boy's
life Is twice, as valuable "as that of a
girl. Further it waswheld , that $6000
awarded to the :- f athv, of . a boy was
not excessive, but-- a. verdict of $5000
awarded to the father of a girl was
reduced by the court to $3000, although
the girl, Ella Werpupp, was noted for
her loveliness of character and for her
beauty. She was said by many to be
the most beautiful girl in Newark, and
accounts of the* accident in which she
was killed. contained many tributes of
love and esteem from her teachers and
school-fellows. . .
* 7 The damage suits grew * out of the
Clifton-avenue trolley accident of Feb
ruary .19, 1903, in which .nine high
school pupils were killed. Judge Ad

ly by. refusing to upset the verdict for
$6000 ' given .by the jury. in favor of
Evan H"., Eastwood, father of Evan F.

several months she had been in ill
health, but forgot her own cares in her
wish for the success of her boy.
The news on Sunday was too much.
She completely collapsed and grew
weaker and died Wednesday morning.
The diagnosis of the physicians showed
that the cause of her death was heart
failure. Induced by great emotion.

aphone, through which he announced
that until order was maintained he
would adjourn the "meeting to the
Hall of Representatives and ex
clude all except the delegates and
representatives of the press. Judge El

the convention. This was adopted and
then on recommendation of the com

organization was made permanent.
Yates â¢ adherent climbed one of the
stringers of the convention hall and
from his perilous position suspended a

a follower of Dineen duplicated the

Chinese Bantlit* Committing Depreda
tions in Vicinity of Yinkow.
NEWCHWANG, May 13.â Chines,?
bandits are committing depredations in
the vicinity of Yinkow. Several rich
natives who were kidnaped by them
from Newchwang have been ran
somed.
M. Pavloff. formerly Russian Minis
ter to Korea and now the representa
tive of Viceroy Alexieff, who is one of
the ablest of Russian diplomats, Is
now in Peking, and it Is believed that
he is endeavoring to persuade the Chi
nese Government to take over the
Newchwang section.
Japanese scouts were seen at a laU?
hour yesterday seven miles southeast
ot Kiaochau.
A part of the Japanese army is at
j present marching from Hsiuyen to
I the northwest. The number of this
force cannot be obtained, but It Is
known to be considerable.
The Russians are moving two regi
ments in and out of Newchwang for
the purpose of creating the impression
among the natives that they have a
number of men here. These two regi
ments comprise the only Russian force
in this vicinity. The remainder of the
troops - formerly stationed here are be
ing moved toward Mukden.
The belief â¢tevails here that the
Russian authorities will soon move the
Mukden forces In the direction of Har
bin, and it Is not thought that they will
risk another fight on the Liaotung
Peninsula.
As they retreat to the north the Rus
sians are burning the railroad sta
tions and such foodstuffs as they are
unable to take with them. Much Chir
nese property has been destroyed. The
Chines* stocks of merchandise at
Newchwang 1 are the largest In Man
churia, being valued at $50,000,000, and
the local Chinamen are In fear that
their property will be destroyed when
the Russian evacuation of Newchwang
Is complete.
Colonel Muenthe, military adviser to
Tuan Shal Kai, commander In chief
of the Chinese forces, has returned to
Peking. He would not talk as to the
nature of his errand here.

WAR NEWS IN NEWCHWANG.
WASHINGTON, May 13.â Naval of
ficers here arc much interested in the
suggestion â¢ that there may be "some
connection between the reflections cast
upon the conduct of Commander W.
A. Marshall of- the United States
steamer Vicksburg'at* the battle of
Chemulpo on February 9 and the fact
that the commander of H. M. S. Tal
bot, there at -the-same time, was Cap
tain Lewis Bayly, formerly British
r.aval attache at Washington.
Captain Bayly left r Washington
rattier in disfavor of the Navy. De
partment because of his overzeal 'â¢'. in
the collection of information about the
defenses nf the United States. Hedid
not return, but gossip that his meth
ods were the subject of, representa
tions to Great Britain cannot be con
firmed. He Is understood to have been
much irritated at the publicity and
adverse comment concerning his ob
servation of. the water approaches to
Tampa, Fla. He was reported to have
chartered a tug, to have run out to
pea, and, approaching the harbor en
trance, to .have made certain sound
ings, especially In shoal passages.
The Navy Department sought and
obtained an official report on the mat
ter, and It was for a time under con
sideration by Assistant Secretary Dar
ling. When Captain Bayly left the
United States for England in 1902 it was
freely stated that he would not return,
and did not care. There was no evi
dence that he had obtained any par
ticularly valuable information. Tampa,
however, was. an Important base for
war supplies during the war with
Spain, and would probably be equally
important In any future conflict. Th<?
Navy Department has always made a
practice of giving considerable liberty
to naval attaches of foreign govern
ments, but frowns on their attempts
to tread on forbidden ground.
Commander Marshall's official re
port of thr- battle of Chemulpo. In ad
dition to stating he offered Russian
sailor? medical aid and shelter on the
transport Zafiro, indicates that he was
ignored by the commanders of the
British, French and Italian warships
!n the harbor at that time. They held
:- conference and sent a protest to
Admiral Uriu against his threat to
bombard the harbor. 'Â«;.'>
Commander Marshall makes no men r
tion of having been invited to Join thl-v
conference. It is believed the end of
the matter is not yet In sight, and
further representations may be made
to Great Britain concerning Captajn
Bayly's conduct.

weight of numbers.
TOKIO, May 13. â The Japanese tor
pedo-boat No. 48 was destroyed while
removing mines from Kerr Bay, north
of Talienwan (Port Dalny) yesterday.
Seven men were killed and seven were
wounded. This Is the first warship
Japan has lost in the war.
The torpedo-boat was lost during a
series of bombardments and survey-
Ing operations at Tallenwan, Deep and
Kerr bays by Admiral Kataoka, com-
mander of the Third Squadron. The
admiral arrived at Kerr Bay early in
the morning and detached the cruisers
Itsukushima, Nfsshin and Miyako,
ordering them to bombard the land
batteries while a flotilla of torpedo
boats swept the harbor for mines.
A second flotilla of torpedo-boats,
which had been engaged j in guarding
Port Arthur the previous night,, joined
the squadron and began the wprk of
surveying the harbor. The Miyako dis
covered a company of Russian Infantry
and a detachment of cavalry on shore
and dispersed them. The survey was
completed at 3 o'clock In- the afternoon.
Two torpedo boats that were recon
noitering and removing mines on the
west shore of Kerr Bay discovered a
telegraph line running along the Taku
shan peninsula. In order to destroy
this Lieutenant Hotta and four sailors
landed and scaled the heights under
the protection of the guns of the tor
pedo boats and cut the line. The Jap
anese vessels then discovered three
bodies of Russian troops, one large and
two small ones, thereupon the squad
ron advanced close to the shore and
shelled them.
The Miyako, which was reconnoiter-
Ing in Deep Bay, discovered a Russian
guard post 'on a mountain to the north
west of Robinson promontory and de
stroyed it. A Russian force estimated
at ten companies took refuge behind
an eminence, but it was dispersed by
the Japanese. . .
- Torpedo boats Nos. 48 and 49 dis
covered a large mechanical mine . in
Kerr Bay. Their various attempts to
blow it up failed, and It suddenly ex
ploded of itself, cutting No. 48 In two.
The torpedo boat sank in seven min
utes. The squadron hurried boats to
the rescue and picked up the wounded.
Three other mines were discovered and
exploded. The squadron completed Its
operations at 6 o'clock in the evening
and -returned to its base.
KXPKCT GREAT BATTLE.
Russians Look for Japan to Strike In
n Fortnight.
ST: PETERSBURG, May 13, 2:15 p.
m.â Much uncertainty exists here as to
exactly what is occurring at the thea
ter of war, as much in regard to the
Russian movements as those of the
enemy. General Kuropatkin's plans
are most carefully guarded. Although
he is believed to be concentrating
troops near IJaoyang, very little actual
information on the subject Is obtain
able. The general impression, how
ever,, is that heavy fighting will occur
within; a fortnight. The rainy season,
which will render the roads almost im
passable, begins in six weeks, and the
latest belief here is that the enemy
hopes to make his position secure by a
decisive engagement before the rains
set in.
The three divisions of General Kuro
ki's army separated at Fengwangcheng.
According to the reports of the Rus
sian scouts 10.000. with forty guns and
1309 cavalry, moved north to Samatskl
(Satmaki), whence they could strike
either Mukden or Llaoyang. The flank
of this force is protected by a battalioni
of infantry, three squadrons of cavalry
and a mountain battery at Kuang
changsiang. A division of Japanese
guards proceeded west to Hancheng,
and 10.000 infantry, with fifty guns,
mostly mountain pieces, moved south
west toward Kaiping and reached the
Palidaypu ford of the Tatang River
Tuesday, leaving Wednesday for Su
yanchlu. How many reserves came up
behind them on the Fengwangcheng
road Is not known, i
All of these forces at their rate of
traveling are due at their destinations
Sunday or Monday. It is considered
probable that the northern force will
be heavily reinforced and that a simi
lar attack of the southern division will
clear the railroad, to Newchwang and
permit the enemy to move directly
northward an*tt strike the Russian
flank at Liaoyang or Mukden, in co
operation with the force which was
at Samatsy Wednesday. The Russians
intend to make an attempt to hold one
or two stations on the railroad. Ac
cording to the last accounts they are
still in possession of Kaiplng, Hai
cheng and Tahchekiau.
BIDDERS FOR CRUISERS
RETAIN BUYERS* IDENTITY
Contract Is Signed by the Chilean
Government for Sale of Two
War Vessels.
WASHINGTON, May 13.â Senor
Walker Martinez, Minister from Chile
in Washington, said to-night that the
identity of the nation for which
Charles R- Flint & Co. are trying to buy
the two Chilean cruisers, Esmeralda
and Chacabuco, had not yet been dis
closed.
The Minister verified the news re
ported this morning that a contract
had been signed. This was to sell the
cruisers for $5,030,000. Flint & Co.
agreeing to forfeit $150,000 if :*ie ships
were not sold.
"Of course these ships cannot be sold
until our Congress approves." said the
Minister. "Congress meets the first of
June and this contract will have to be
approved by both houses before It Is
valid. I have not been informed who
Flint & Co. are buying the ships for
and understand that this has so far
been kept secret from my Government.
It Is understood, however, they are to
go to a neutral power. We could not
sell these ships to belligerents."
The busy work on every side, digging
trenches, throwing up redoubts and
general feverish military activity, con
trasted with peaceful nature, adorned
by beautiful spring, the blow of lilac,
almond and apricot blossoms. It was
a fairy picture framed by hills of red
dish hue.
"We went on to Kinchow. We de
cided after passing that place to stick
to the railroad, boarding an open
freight car which the locomotive pulled
along the deserted country to Sanshi
lipou. Tifere was not a single employe
there, but the station was crowded
with Chinese. As soon as we neared
the station three horsemen dashed off
toward the hills to the east.
"Captain Odintzoff mounted the lo
comotive and ordered the engineer" to
go ahead, leaving me behind in com
mand of the freight car and a second
locomotive with soldiers on board. Two
hours later Captain Odintzoff met a
small detachment of our cavalry eight
miles ahead and sent b'ack to me a
note book, requesting me. In case he
failed to turn up to proceed to Port
Arthur and to hand the book to Gen
eral Stoessel. We waited another hour,
when we were rejoined by the colonel
and went back to Wafandian, whence,
the next day, he took an ammunition
train to Kinchow."

LONDON. Mav 13. -So intense has
grown the enthusiasm for Japan here
that the Japanese Embaesador has
many inquiries from Englishmen
anxious to nssume his nationality. The
Embassador has made a public state
ment in which he advises, with some
hum or, that the caelost, quickest and
p!eas.intm way for a foreigner to be
come Japanese is to marry a Japanese
woman.
Evidently there is pretty strong ex
pectation in oflicial quarters here that
a palace revolution will be among the
next events to happen in St. Peters
burg. Humor has it that the Czar is
anxious to abdicate, which means
that his uncle, Grand Duke Vladimir,
is influencing him with a view to his
own accession.
Grand Duke Michael, the Czar's
brother,' heir presumptive, who is con
sumptive ar.d otherwise a weakling,
has always been willing to renounce
his ric!:ts. He would have done so
long ago but for his mother, the Dow
ager Empress, who is probablv also
the chief obstacle to the Czar's re
tirement.
His Majesty is said to devote most of
his time to prayer and to be falling
more and more under the influence
of Father John of Kronstadt. who rep
resents obscurantism in its worst
It is impossible to identify many of
the Russianized Chinese names given
In the Kussian staff accounts of the
Japanese advance in Manchuria. Gen
eral Kuroki's boldness in pushing on
is commented on here as showing that
he believes General Kuropatkin's forces
are much weaker than they are repre
sented.
The partial destruction of Dalny is
regarded as showing that the Russians
anticipate the Japanese will make a
determined attempt to capture Port
Arthur, while, owing to the moral ef
fect that the fall of the stronghold
would have on Russian prestige, an
equal determined resistance will be
made.
"The sky was of an intense blue,
showing up the black masses of Cape
Stone and the frowning dragon hills
behind Slaopingtao. where it was said
the enemy's scouts were lurking.
Westward gleamed the Mlaotao islands
and nearer the Tiger's Tail and Llao
teshan, while behind, far, far away,
was the Eagle's Nest, whence a
view is obtainable of the whole of the
Regent's Sword peninsula. Out upon
the limitless ocean twelve tiny spots
Indicated â¢ the Japanese warships and
smaller dots tlje enemy's swift-mov
ing torpedo boats, watching the coast
to prevent any of our craft slipping
through to Chefu or Newchwsng.
"I decided to steal through during
the night, across the stretch of rail
road. Communication was interrupted
and . General Stoessel proposed that I
should accompany Captain Odlntzoff,
who haa been empowered to enter into
communication with the enemy. We
left Port Arthur at 6 o'clock in the
morning and two hours later reached
the position commanded by the ener
getic and tireless General Fock, who
defends the whole northern section of
Liaotung. Reports were coming In
every few minutes of Japanese land-
Ings, large and small, of first encoun
ters with our outposts, of first losses.
VIEW OF THE EN'EMY.
"On Saturday, May 7, I decided by
hook or crook, to join the Manchurlan
army at Llaoyang, It being plainly Im
possible to write or telegraph from
Port Arthur. I paid a farewell visit
to the batteries and Inspected their po
sitions.
"The number of Chinese seeking
work on the fortifications and as ser
vants is more numerous than ever.
As long as there is nee there will be
Chinamen. The attitude of the Chi
nese authorities Is changing and becom
ing threatening. The natives are. clear
ly our friends and the authorities
clearly antagonistic. For Instance, the
Governor of the Province of Fuchow,
northwest of west, on the Liaotung
peninsula, has announced that he will
behead all the natives In our service
very soon and that he will burn Wan
andian, one of the neighboring towns,
which has shown itself friendly to the
Russians. After the skirmish at Wan.
andlan between the Japanese advance
and the Russian guard, the Governor
executed the Interpreter and the ser
vant of Lieutenant Hellmer, the Rus
sian military chief In charge of that
section of the railroad.
"Beyond Cape Terminal, the Japanese
are landing immense stores of rice and
siege guns. The surrounding heights
are occupied by their scouts. The Jap
anese struck the railroad first between
San Shlllpou and Polandien, about fif
ty miles from here, and blew up a sec
tion of the bridge with melinite. They
fired onour sentries, and later, finding
one of them killed, a Japanese took off
his tunic, rolled It up and 'placed It
under his head, as a pillow, and then
reverently crossed the dead man's
arms over his breast.
"Japanese cavalry .reconnoitered the
peninsula from the north to ascertain
whether we were safely Imprisoned.
But this did not cause any particular
impression In Port Arthur. The weath
er was beautiful, a band was playing
on the boulevard and there were many
people unconcernedly promenading the
streets. "We heard that the Japanese
had fired on the last outgoing train
carrying the Russian sick and wound
ed, and had succeeded in wounding two
of the passengers.
"Rumors also floated In announcing
the destruction of the railroad and
the blowing up of some of the bridges,
but our spirits remained singularly un
depressed. The military officers and
men talked of nothing except a second
siege of Sebastopol, although, as a mat
ter of fact, Sebastopol had never been
cut off from Its communication on the
land side. "We can die like our fore
fathers," was the universal sentiment
expressed. The Chinese continued work
ing as usual for the most part; very
few of them attempting to escape.
- "It seems that the sole defense of
the Russian stronghold Is General Kon
dratenko. He knows no rest and is
ceaseless in his activity. The utmost
vigilance prevails throughout the for
tifications and the energy displayed by
every one from the highest to lowest Is
marvelous. No one Is now admitted
to Port Arthur. The women from Dal
ny, which was doomed to destruction,
sought shelter here, but were not al
lowed to remain any later than Fri
day of last week.
CHINESE ARE UGLY.
LIAOYANG, May 13.â Nemirovich
Danchenko, popularly known as the
Russian Archibald Forbes, has Just ar
rived here from Port Arthur and fur
nished the following chronicle of events
of the first week of the Investment of
that, fortress. Danchenko escaped from
the beleaguered city by the last train:
"From Thursday, May 5, the power
ful fleet of the enemy's cruisers, the
Adzuma, Asama, Idzumo, Iwate and
another, the name of :which is un
known, together with the flagship Mi
kasa and the battleships Shlkishima,
Hatsuse, Asahi, Yashlma and the Fuji,
remained constantly In sight of Port
Arthur, departing every night and re
turning at daylight. The Japanese tor
pedo-boats occasionally swept our coast
with searchlights at night, while their
barges lay In waiting off Pigeon Bay,
beyond our vision on the western hori
zon, and beneath the lofty hills that
skirt the Llaotung Gulf. Apparently
the Japanese were watching to see If
we intended to interfere- with their
landing farther north.
"Our communications With the north
were broken on Thursday, and the fol
lowing day the telegraph* office in Port
Arthur refused to accept our mes
sages.

ROME. May 13.â A secret report re

Internal situation, of Russia as becom
ing most serious as regards the preser
vation of the present institutions, the
military failures in the East having
strengthened the opinion that the evils
are due to the present organization of
the country, in which a change is

The hope is expressed that the Em

sible to raise an army and collect the
means necessary to defeat Japan.
Otherwise, the report says, it Is be
lieved all the efforts made at St. Peters
burg will remain futile, as besides the
war in the Far East Russia will be
obliged to face a latent If not an open
revolutionary movement at home, de
priving her of the assistance of the

NEW YORK. May 13.â "The Russian

the same thing may.be said of the sol

Â«i;d not the praying that wins," said
General Nelson A. Miles to-nisht in
explaining the success of the Japanese
soldiers against Russia.
General Miles was speaking at a din
ner to members of the order of the
Founders and Patriots of America, of
which Admiral Dewey to-day was
elected Governor General.
"It has been my privilege." said Gen
eral Mi'.es. "to see most r,i the armies
of the Tvorld. I have studied carefully
the armies of Japan and of China and
the soldiers til Russia, and the success
in the Far East to-day of the soldier?
of the M;kado is due to their wonderful
skill, the faithful performance of their
duties and their remarkable enter
prif .
"Of all the armies of the world."
continued General Miles, "ours seems
to differ in that the men are serving
for principle. Our men seem to feel
that they are working for a free peo
ple, for a republic in which every man
Is a sovereign and every woman a su
perior of a sovereign. Our flag rep
resents the sovereignty and the free
dom of manhood. It is a pleasure as
well as an honor to serve under it. I
know this from my forty years' ex
perience as a soldier. In all that time
there never was an hour of the day
that it was not a pleasure to me to
be in the service."
Admiral Dewey sxid: "I do not know
, as we have any better navy than we
had. but we have better tools than
we had a few years ago. Of course,
the newspapers will say we have not;
but. take my word for it, we have the
best ships and the best officers and
jthe lvÂ»st m<>n in the whole world. As
to the enlisted men especially, we are
getting the cream of the world and
with such men ready and eager to
fight, the other nations are going to
let us alone. And in a few years to

Get> the
Spring Habit
Thouvgnds have got this habit, and
the benefits they receive every spring,
provided they use the correct medi-
cine, follow them through the heat and
debility of summer weather.
Of all the medicines used in the
Spring, Mood's Sarsaparilla is by far
the best.
It exceeds all others in general use,
as it does in general excellence and
medicinal merit.
Jf it happens that you have not yet
rot the Spring Medicine Habit, get it
at once, and make it a "fixed habit,"
and make Hood's Sarsaparilla the only
medicine you take. Get Hood's tq/day.

United States District Attorney Mar
shall B. Woodworth yesterday entered
a nolle prosequi in the United States
District Court in the cases of the
United States against Frank A. McKee.
Pearley Maxwell, Frank Wagner and
Calvin Stewart, indicted for cutting
timber illegally on Government land.
The ground given for the abandon
ment of the prosecution was that in
the trial of the civil suit against the
defendants* for damages for the tim
ber cut it was shown that they had not
had any criminal Intent and had vio
lated the law simply through inad
vertence. In the four civil cases men
tioned the Government recovered
$2713, together' with about $700 costs
and interest from September 30, 1901.
No Criminal Intent Can Be Shown
and Full Value of Property
Is Repaid.

From well-informed sources it is
learned that it has been practically de
termined that six new Bishops will be
elected. While the Pacific Coast has
one avowed and one passive candidate
for the position, there are others men
tioned. In the opinion of a delegate
who understands the episcopal situa
tion, it is unlikely that a representa
tive of the Pacific Coast will be named
to a place on the Board of Bishops.
The eighty-nine colored delegates are
making a fight to have one of their
race elected Bishop, and while they
have the support of a portion of the
white delegates it Is doubtful If they
will succeed.
The committee on itinerancy met this
afternoon and heard the report of a
sub-committee upon the very important
matter of a time limit upon the ten
ure of pastorates. The report favored
leaving the matter Just where it is at
present, that is, an unlimited tenure.
The sentiment of the entire committee
seemed to approve of this recommenda
tion, though formal action was de
ferred. It seems to be the opinion of
the committeemen that the rule adopt
ed four years ago has not been given
a fair trial.
Dr. A. B. Leonard wished to amend
by striking out after the word "resi
dence" and substituting: "He may per
form temporarily, upon invitation of a
general superintendent, any function
that belongs to a general superintend
ent except make appointments."
Upon this amendment the contest
was made, and the substitute was
finally defeated by a decisive vote. The
report of the committee was then
adopted unanimously.
STANDING COMMITTEES 3IEET.
The various standing committees
held meetings this afternoon, and It is
anticipated that many of the important
questions to be decided by the General
Conference will come up for considera
tion in rapid succession from now on.
The episcopacy committee met in ex
ecutive session, and although the pro
ceedings are closely guarded It is pretty
well understood to-night that the
names of the various candidates for
bishopric honors were under considera
tion.
A uuDeranr.uated gpneral superintendent is
relieved from the obligation to travel through
the connection at large and may choose the
place of hi? residence. He Ehall not be as
signed to the presidency of annual confer
<-nces nor make appointments; but. if re
quired by a Bishop presiding, he may take
the chair temporarily in a general or annual
conference; and, at the request of the Bishop
priding In the annual conference, he may
ordain- candidates previously elected to orders.
the superannuated Bishops, which was
finally adopted, reads as follows:-

The police are looking for Rena Mc-

fect that Rena McLain nad been in
the habit of visiting a dance hall
kept by a man named Martin on Mar

Ever since 1 left Hyda I have been receiv
ing anonymous letters denouncing him and
tellini.- me to wait and I would see the end.
Within the past week I have been impressed
with the fact that they came from Govern
mental sources. â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ I made up my
mind that whatever else I concluded to do 'the
time had come for me to press Hyde In the
matter of the Sellgman deal, from which Ben
son and Â¦ he have cleaned up some $75,000 to
date. So I sent for him and read him the let
ters. He was alarmed beyond- measure. 1
asked him what he had to suggest and his
reply was typical :
"Of course, Dimond, I have such a high re
gard for your honor and Integrity I know you
would never take a case against me, especially
of this character, and I'll tell you what you
can do that will help me greatly. When these
officials call on you make them think you are
ioin~ to take the cast?. lead them on all you
can and jeet all the information possible from
them, then turn them down. You will help me
very much and I shall be able to get ahead
of them.
I let him go on to a point where he had
laid bare his cold-blooded heart to me, then
I stopped him and I think that F. A. Hyde
never had as tough a half-hour In his life. I
asked him what obligation I was under to
him: that If h!a first statement was true his
request was a direct Insult emanating from a
guilty mind; that before he dared ask even a
legitimate friendly act he should put himself
right by according the compensation duo
me. â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
The interview ended \ty my telling him that
so far as the case against him was concerned
I should be the Judge of/my own actions, but
that before I considered any one save myself,
I prcposed to be raid for the service I had
performed : that I had cent for him because,
however' badly he had treated me, I felt It
was but fair to notiry him of the fact before
I even considered the question of ! a case
against him. "
I would like your opinion on the course I
have pursued. Much I need It, I cannot see
how I could possibly take rart In the Gov
ernment side of the case if offered. Of course,
I learned much In Washington, and, putting
this and that together. I now know nil there
Is to know. But I Â«was employed by these
people ( Hyde , and Benson) at the time and
my Information concerns them. I did. how
ever, feel Justified in using this situation to
fcrce from Hyde what was my Just due and
let him think what he pleased.
If you can spare a moment's time to write,
dc so and let me know if it is true that the
Secretary has fpokrn to you about me.
MERCILESS QUESTIONS. '
Here are a few of the questions and
answers that followed the Introduction
of this letter:
You tried to leave the impression, then. In
Hyde's mind, that you were considering the
: question of employment by the Government
orainst him? .
I No. sir, I told him emphatically that I
would not take a case afterward.
What did you mean by this statement : "Of
course I learned much in Washington, and
putting: , this and .that together I now know
all there is to know" ?
Â¦ f Â¦ I thought I did know all there was to know
I find I did not know anything.
You did not mean you knew enough to send
Hyde to the penitentiary?
I did not. . '
What did you mean by this statement: "I
did. however, feel Justified in using this situa
1 tion to force from Hyde what was rri v Â¦ Just
due and let him think what he pleased"? '
. I do not know what I thought at the mo
ment of sending that letter. ,<
Did you. not. mean this. Mr. Dimond, that,
needing money badly,' and having read In the
newspapers on the morning ' of December ' 20
that Mr. Benson had been Indicted and that
Hyde would be indicted, and that. Hyde was
in ' Los 'Angeles, , and on December Â¦ 22. ''Just
as soon as you could get hold ' of Hyde, , In
view Â¦ of that Â¦ situation.'- you took : advantage of
It. sent for him, and threatened him that you
would testify to all you had learned In 'Wash
ington or would : ' accept' employment by ' the -
ment and pay him a higher salary.
Many of these letters were read into
the record, anbv with question after
question the Federal lawyer relent
lessly drove home the contradictions
between the evidence of the epistles
and Dimond's earlier testimony, that
he had voluntarily quit Hyde because
he suspected his State school land titles
might not stand the strain of a criminal
prosecution. With the wonderful
nerve shown throughout his long
ordeal on the stand, the defendant
denied everything, often with fierce
emphasis and angry gestures, but his
face, always the 1 color of", parchment,
became more and more haggard, and in
the intervals of Heney's grilling he
sank back in his seat almost ex
hausted. When it was all over and
the Commissioner had announced that
he must go to Washington for trial,
Dimond \va3 a picture of despair. Even
his codefendant, Hyde, always gay and
sanguine, blanched when he saw the
failure of his first battle for escape
from prison.
The most damaging of the letters
from Dimond to Browne that Heney
read bore date of December 31, 1903,
With it Dimond had inclosed copies of
the anonymous letters suggesting that
the Government was ready to retain
him for Hyde's prosecution. In part
the epistle was as follows:
FROM DIMON'D TO BUOWXE.
With this admission, as helpful to
the Government as Heney could have
asked, the witness left the stand.
Commissioner Heacock will this
morning enter the order of commit
ment in accordance with his statement
yesterday. The defendants' counsel
will at once apply to District Judge de
Haven for writs of habeas corpus in
order to bring their clients before the
court, while Heney will ask;the Judge
for an order removing the defendants
to Washington forthwith. The argu
ment on the issue thus raised will be
postponed by consent until July, when
Heney will have completed his work in
the Oregon land fraud cases at Port
land, where he goes to-morrow. Judge
de Haven will then be asked to review
the Commissioner's rulings on many
points and an effort will be made to
vacate the commitment order.
No. sir, I never thought of such a thing. I
wrote the letter to Browne because I wanted
to see ir they really did emanate from Gov
ernmental sources.
And did you not. on December 31, write this
letter tof< Browne, because the two letters to
thÂ« Secretary had been Â« answered by William
J. Burns by an advertisement as requested
in the anonymous letters, â¢ In the Chronicle,
which advertisement you had seen, and which
led you to believe the Government was willing
to deal with you to find out what you knew,
and that therefore you wanted Browne to go
to the Secretary and see what they thought
about .you?
I have already testified as to that. I did
not. It may be difficult for you to imagine
what a gentleman might do under stress of
circumstances, but he would not stoop to
blackmail.
Government to help prosecute him if he did
not pay you the amount you demanded of him
on the Aztec deal?
No, sir. That may be a beautiful exposi
tion of your theory, but it is not the fact.
And did you not. when Air. Hyde left your
office on December Â»2, out of anger, Im
mediately sit down and write the two anony
mous letters to the Secretary of the Interior,
which are here in evidence, and which were
mailed in San Francisco on December 'SZ,
19U3?

We have been to see all of her friends and
to every place where she possibly could hav,>
gone. All day long her friend3 have been
coming here and they are as amazed ai we
are at her disappearance.
We gave the case over to Detective Cole

tain him or pay him for his services. n*
seemed very indifferent about the case an.l
yesterday afternoon he came up her* and t<>
my dear sick invalid wife he sa!d. "Oh. don't
worry, she is out having a good time. I
gaess she will 'blow in' here alright" Thin
insult has only added to my wife's terrible
grief at the disappearance of our child.
Sometime after this my daughter came home
in a great state of nervous excitement. ShÂ«?
said that an emaciated dark woman had conn
icto the store and totd her she must go Wttfl
her and see Dr. dw Albersaria. My daughter
wÂ«3 greatly terrified at the occurrence anil
after that she positively refused t^> go on the
street at night unless accompanied by hÂ«r
sisters cr her brot'..or.
GIRL TERROR STRICKEN".
She has blonde hair and dark blue eyes. ShÂ©
was dressed In a gray skirt, with a white wai.*t
and a brown Jacket, and she wore a brown
French sailor hat trimmed with popples, a
coined silver Guatemala belt, a gold watch
and chain and a diamond and turquoise ring.
She never wÂ«nt out alone at r.iKht. and has
always been a gentle, kind and affectionate
daughter and has never asked to receive any
callers here. She was devoted to her mother.
We fear there la some terrible mystery con
nected with her disappearance. It was only n
short time ago that a doctor that calls himself
Saarea de Albergarla met her in the store in
which she was working. When she came homr?
that night rho told U3 that she had be*-n terri
fied that day by thl3 doctor, who told her th^t
unless she came up to hi3 rooms he would kill
her. and that he had already shot at a woman
that had refused to do his bidding. Som* time
ago a thin, poorly clad woman came to our
house and Inquired for my daughter. When
told that her mother was in the house the
woman ran away down the street.
JuÂ«t before she left her home she received a
telephonic communication from J. I. Martin,
whom she had met when she was In thj em
ploy of Straus*? & Frohman. Whether h<>
knows anything about her disappearance, or
where she Is. I cannot state. She Is a very
handsome girl IS years old
DESCRIPTION' OF GIKL.
The mystery enshrouding the where
abouts of pretty Edith Williams, whosa
disappearance from her home, at 555
Ellis street, was reported to the police
Thursday night, is still unsolved.
Her distracted parents are beside
themselves with grief, and are fearful
that some terrible fate has befallen
her.
No member of the missing girl's fam
ily can offer any suggestions as to
what has become of her. All they
know is -that on Thursday afternoon
she started out to go to Stewarts
store on Taylor street between Turk and
Eddy to take some pleating and was
then going to call on a woman, a
friend of the family, at the Golden
West Hotel. She promised to bo back
at 4 o'clock, to sit with her Invalid
mother, who is suffering from heart
disease. From the time she left her
home nothing has been heard of her.
Her father, W. L. Williams, said:
The somewhat unusual scene of both
Dr. J. M. Buckloy and Dr. T. B. Neely
arrayed on the same side of a sub
ject was the feature of the debate.
Opposed to these two leaders were Dr.
A. B. Leonard, Dr. Lytle of Ohio, and
Judges Lohr and Warnock, laymen.
The paragraph fixing the status of
LOS ANGELES. May 13.â The Meth
odist General Conference can now be
said to be fairiy launched upon the
'work of legislating in the interests of
the church at large. Two matters of
much importance to Methodism in
general, affecting the administrative
work of the church, were disposed of
at to-day'g session. One was the rather
delicate duty of the episcopacy eo-m
inittee in fixing the status and rela
lionEhip of superannuated Bishops to
the church and the other a rule re
ported by the board of church exten
sion and adopted by the conference,
depriving certain congregations own
ing churches costing more than $10,000
Â«'f the right to apply to that board for
financial assistance. These two mat
ters, together with the completion of
the rules of order, exhausted the en
tire session.
The special order of the day was the
repc-rt of Missionary Bishop Frank W.
Warne of India, but upon the request
of Dr. J. M. Buckley, chairman of the
committee on episcopacy, the rules
vere suspended in order to permit con
sideration of the two matters above
mentioned, and Bishop Warne's re
port was made the special order for
t' o'clock to-morrow. Dr. Buckley's re
port on superannuated Bishops occa
sioned the most animated and inter
esting discusion thus far developed in
the Genera! Conference. It brought
to the fore some of the "dominant fig
ures of the conference and the dele
gates were entertained by the clear
reasoning and eloquent expressions of
some of its best orators.

of Important Measures,
General Conference Delegates Dispose
The effect of this unexpected action
by the committee will be that the con
ference will be called upon to elect a
preater number of new Bishops than
Â¦was expected when the great body be
gan its labors and there will conse
quently be much rivalry for the new
places and many new candidates. Just
how many Bishops will be elected is
a matter which a subcommittee of the
committee on episcopacy is try
ing to settle. The subcommittee was
Mill in session at 1:30 o'clock this
morning and had not reached a de
cision. It is now practically certain
that six to eight new Bishops will be
f fcosen for America and at least three
new missionary bishnns.

LOB ANGELES, May 14. â The com
mittee on episcopacy of the Methodist
General Conference will present a re

that five and possibly six Bishops now
on thÂ« active list be retired at the
close of this conference and it is cer
tain that the filing of such a report
vill be one of the climaxes of the ses-
Fion. The decision was reached short

SpÂ«c!a! Dispatch to The Call.
SPRINGFIELD, Ohio. May 13.â Carl
Philomon, an artist, educated in Greece,
who for some years has been living in
San Francisco, was reunited to-day at
Washington Courthouse, twenty-five
miles south of here, with his long-lost
Bister, Miss Blanche, from whom he
had been separated for many years.
He was adopted by another family in
his youth, and after he returned from
Greece could find no trace of his sister.
The girl was a waitress in the hotel
where Philomon is a guest. He will
take her and another sister, who lives
In Greenfield, Ohio, to San Francisco
to live.
SrwdaJ Dispatch to The Call
The right of Brazil being thus clear and the
positive recognized by Peru in the treaty of
1851; Brazil is but fair and friendly In admit
ting the new claim of Peru and showing her
disposition to resort to arbitration under the
usual conditions and is justified in asking the
evacuation of the territories unlawfully occu
pied by Peru, a condition accepted and followed
by other rations in similar cases.
The beat proof of the Invalidity of that title
was sriven by Peru herself when she thought
a new treaty necessary and in settling the
boundary with Brazil in 1851 the principle of
uti possidetls as the only title remaining, no
mention or reserve being made of the- defunct
treaty of 1777. Peru also has no right based
on actual possession. For that possession up
to the sources of the Rivera Jurua and Purus
has been shown to be Brazilian, under the
principle of uti possidetls. following the rule
of Pinckney and Monroe.
The protest made by Peru against the treaty
of 1S67 between Brazil and Bolivia was never
admitted nor given the least consideration by
Brazil. Besides, in that' treaty Brazil did not
recognize the territories as belonging to Bo
livia. It is true that later, under a very
liberal interpretation and with a view to fa
voring Bolivia for political purposes, some gov
ernments of Brazil ceded the territories to her.
But this was only a cession made against pow
erful expression of public opinion. The recent
treaty of Petropolls was for that reason de
signed to readjust the matter by the rea?ser
tion of Brazil's rights. The tltl* of Brazil to
the territories is not therefore by the recent
treaty of Petropolls. Against Bolivia, aa
against Peru, the title on which the right of
Brazil is established is the utl possidetis pre
extent to any treaty.
"WASHINGTON, May 13.âNotwith
standing reports by cable to the effect
that Peru has consented to withdraw
her troops from the territory .in the
Acre region, now In dispute between
Peru and Brazil, It Is said that, be
cause that offer is coupled with the
demand for the- neutralization of the
territory, the crisis has not yet been
averted. Meanwhile the argument be
tween ' the representatives of the two
countries in Washington continues and
the latest contribution which is said
marks the conclusion of the Brazilian
case was given to the press to-day
from the Brazilian Legation. ThÂ«
statement follows:
The Interpretation given by Brazil to the
treaty of 1851 has always been the same and
the only onÂ© compatible with International law.
namely, that by the principle of utl possidetls.
as adopted in the treaty of 1851. Peru recog
nized the territories to the south and east of
the Tavary as belonging to Brazil. The utl
possidetls. as explained by the Peruvian Le

HISTORY OF THE CASE
ACTION IS UNEXPECTED
Heney's finish with Dimond yester
day morning was one of the severest
pieces of cross-examination ever heard
In a San Francisco courtroom. It was
based, upon the Dimond letters fur
niHhed to the Government by Attorney
A. B. Browne of Washingtonâ letters
sent to, Browne J during 1903, when
Dimond was .using his knowledge " of
Hyde's methods in his attempt to force
the speculator to continue his employ-
A DRAMATIC CLOSE.
In such competent hands the investi
gation speedily put the Government in
possession of evidence tending to show
that Benson and Hyde had acquired
great areas of public lands by illegal
means. In December last Benson was
arrested and indicted on a charge of
bribing clerks in the General Land Of
fice to furnish him with secret inform
ation on cases pending before the office
and regarding the investigation of his
own and Hyde's methods. In February
the Grand Jury of the District of Co
lumbia returned a second indictment
charging Benson and Hyde, with Henry
P. Dimond, a San Francisco attorney,
who had represented them at Wash
ington, and Joost H. Schneider of Tuc
son, Ariz., formerly a clerk in Hyde's
office, with conspiracy to defraud the
United States.
CHARGE OF WHOLESALE FRAUD.
Specifically the Indictment alleges that
the defendants had been obtaining
fraudulent titles to Oregon and Cali
fornia school lands by the use of dum
mies, fictitious locators and forged affi
davits; that they had bribed Interior
Department officials to have these
State lands included within forest re
serves created under the act of 1897,
and that they had then filed with the
department deeds of relinquishment to
their school lands and demanded, in
accordance with the terms of the act,
that the Government Issue in lieu
thereof patents to unoccupied lands
outside the reserves. Hyde and Benson
were charged as the principals, Dimond
and Schneider as accessories. In par
ticular It was alleged that Dimond,
during his service, in Wasnington, had
committed, in furtherance of the con
spiracy, the overt acts mat gave the
Supreme Court of the District of Co
lumbia jurisdiction of the crime.
On this indictment Benson and
Schneider were arrested in the East,
but Hyde and Dimond, having been
apprehended in San Francisco, were
brought before Heacock on a motion
to commit them for trial. In the long
and fiercely contested struggle that
followed the Government was repre
sented by Francis J. Heney, now of the
local bar, but formerly Attorney, Gen
eral of Arizona; by Judge Pugh, the
Interior Department lawyer already
named, 'and by Oliver E. Pagin, who
drew the indictment and who was for
many years United States District At
torney at Chicago, but is now. in charge
of the pleadings and criminal division
of the Department of Justice at Wash
ington. ; Garret W. McEnerney and
Bert Schlesinger appeared for Hyde,
while Dimond was defended by Charles
S. Wneeler and Samuel Knight.
Heacock's ruling marks the close of
the first step in one of the most im
portant Federel prosecutions under
taken in recent years. The case has
attracted wide attention, especially
throughout the West, where the injury
to the public interests through the
fraudulent operations o-r land grabbers
has long been a cause of general com
plaint. . '
During the autumn of 1902 Secretary
Hitchcock of the Interior Department
set on foot an investigation of the
methods of Frederick A. Hyde 'and
John A. Benson, two well known land
speculators residing in this city, who
were operating especially in forest re
serve lieu lands under the Forest Re
serve Act of 1&97. This investigation
was committed to Judge A. B. Pugh,
a prominent Washington attorney con
nected with the ; Interior Department,
and William J. Burns, a special agent
in the secret service, who was well
known on this coast because of his
connection with the Dimmiek prosecu
tion for embezzlejnent at the San Fran
cisco Mint, and still better known
thrc-ughout the country for his success
ful running down of the boldest and
most dangerous gang of counterfeiters
in the history of the United Statesâ
the Kendig-Jacobs confederacy at Lan
caster and Philadelphia, Pa., who, after
defrauding the Government of vast
sums by their manufacture and use of
internal revenue stamps, were caught
by Burns in the act of floating, with
'.he aid of New York bankers and re
tired Federal officials, an Issue of $12,
000,000 well-executed, high denomina
tion treasury notes.
A NOTEAVORTHY CASE.
The outcome of the remarkable hear
ing that has been in progress since
March 22, was announced at the close
of Dimond's testimony yesterday after
noon, counsel for the Government and
for the defense having agreed to waive
argument on the case. The question of
bail was at once taken up. Francis
J. Heney, on behalf c-f the prosecution,
asked that the defendants' bonds be
doubled, saying that he believed the
offense was not extraditable, and that
In view of the vast amount of proof
establishing their guilt beyond reason
able doubt there was cause to appre
hend that Hyde and Dimond, with con
viction staring them in the face, might
see fit to step across the international
border into British Columbia or Mexi
co, and thus escape trial and punish
ment. The Government's motion was
opposed by Schlesinger and Knight for
the defendants, and the commissioner
finally fixed the bail at the amounts
named above. 1
Fred A. Hyde and Henry P. Dlmond,
two of the defendants under Indictment
by the Grand Jury of the District of
Columbia for conspiring to obtain pub-
He lands by fraudulent methods, were
held yesterday by United States Com
missioner Heacock for trial at Wash
ington. Hyde's bail was increased from
530,000 to $50,000, and that of Dimond,
who figures s In the case rather as an
accessory than as a principal, from
$15,000 to $20,000. Formal orders em
bodying these rulings will be entered
by the commissioner at 10 o'clock this
morning.

NAPA, May 13. â Anton Meyer, an
inmate of the Veteran's Home, com
mitted suicide early this morning by
cutting his throat. Meyer was seen
by one of his roommates to leave his
quarters at about_3 o'clock this morn
ing, but as it was known that he was
a great sufferer and often spent part
of the night in walking about the
grounds, no apprehension was felt un
til he failed to appear at breakfast
call. A search was thenjnstituted and
his body was found in the woods
about a mile back of the home.
An examination of the body dis
closed a deep, unsightly cut in the
throat. A closed pocket knife lay be
tide the body. The right hand held
a razor, with which the wound had
been inflicted.
The deceased was a native of Ger
many, 72 years of age. He served in
Company K. Ninth Ohio Infantry, dur
ing the Civil War.
Meyer/had often threatened to kill
himself.

An alleged case of desertion and
extreme cruelty is told by -Mrs. George
W. Loring, wife of George W. Loring,
business agent of the Retail Drivers'
Union, Local No. 278.
With two young children, Ruth,
barely three years of age, and Beula,
six months old, Mrs. Loring wept in
her vacant rooms at 103 Leaven
worth street yesterday and "told
how she had to depend for food on
her neighbors, while there was left but
one bed in the house; floors carpetless,
no stove, excepting a small oil stove
brought to her by a kindly neighbor,
on which to cook whatever might be
sent in for her and her little mites. -
Mrs. Loring. a renned and gentle
woman, had this to say about her
woeful plight:
My husband. Gsorge W. Loring, Is business
&tent of the Retail Driver? 1 Union Local No.
278, and his cruelty toward me reached a cli
max when on Tuesday he brutally struck me
and tore my dress.
Last Monday the furniture was taken to sat
isfy m. mortgage of $175. We were left with
the one bed and not even having the necessary
conveniences with which to attend my little
one.
fTursday my husband came In with a man
named John Bosky. He asked for dinner. We
had only the little etove and I was not pre
pared to rook a dinner. He struck me. and
little Ruth, seeing her father's treatment,
ecrearaed until I feared the child would have a
fit. <
Bosky, who belongs to the same union as my
husband, did not Interfere in my behalf.
At this part of the sad recital the
child chimed in and said with tears
welling up in her expressive eyes:
"Yes, papa beat mamma."
Mrs. Loring continued:
He then left the house and on Wednesday I
Robert McElroy, agent for ex-May
or Phelan. said it seemed to him to
be a deplorable case for a woman to
be left as had Mrs. Lorlng.
Loring, he said, had not paid rent
since ( last March*. He expressed his
deep sorrow for the plight in which he
found her. He speaks In high terms
of Mrs. torlng, who told him of the
treatment she is subjected to at the
hands of her husband.
The unfortunate woman hopes to be
advised to-day as' to the best thing
she can do under the circumstances.
She is almost beside herself in fear
that she may be put out on the streets
with her children.
Mr. McElroy. agent of ex-Mayor Phelan's
estate, of which our home Is a part, has been
exceedingly kind and good. His forbearance
in not pressing us to the extreme wai a gen
erous act.
A Sheriff came on Thursday evening, but on
seelnir thÂ» children and my position he had
not thÂ» heart to turn us out on the street.

; BUFFALO, N\ Y., May 13.â A man
. believed to have been a New York
â¢ stock broker named Snell jumped from
a Cleveland and Buffalo steamer when
the vessel was about three hours out
from Cleveland last evening. A trav
eling man, who refused to give his
f.ame. tells the following story of the
. euicide:
. "I was sitting in the buffet about 10
o'cleck when a short, heavy, red-faced
man .entered. We got into conversa
tion, ard he told mÂ« his name was
Fr.ell. He said, among other things,
that he was financially involved to the
extent of $165,000 through deals in cot
ton, and that he was going to kill him
self because cf his trouble. He threat
ened three times to take his life, and
I urged him not to do anything rash.
'When we left the buffet I called the
attention of a couple of deckhands to
him. A minute or two later I heard
â¢cne of them cry out \hat he had gone
overboard. The captain at once or
dered a lifeboat lowered and the
etcamer was brought to a stop as
quickly as possible."
". Snell went to Cleveland on the same
vessel from Buffalo on Wednesday
night. The body was not recovered.
". NEW YORK. May 13. â Nothing Is
ijnown here of an alleged shortage in
-his accounts of any man named Snell.
Ti'jr is there any broker in the city of

With a shiver of surprise the bur
gler did throw up his hands. Ills pis
tol had been momentarily put In hia
pocket that he might use both hands
ransacking the place. Downstairs the
thief was compelled to march, over
the same road he had forced Mrs. El
liott to follow. In the same room In
which ahe had been surprised the wo
man, with revolver^ still leveled at the
thief, took from his pocket the Jewel
case he had taken. With her treasured
wsfcich recovered, she "let the burglar
run through the kitchen. Over the
back fence he climbed, disappearing In
the fields east of the house. When last
seen the escaping thief was headed
toward Frultvale on the Southern Pa
cific Company's railroad tracks.
The scene of the encounter was one
of the shops conducted by William P.
Elliott, husband of the heroine of the
engagement.
Detectives Kyle and Shorey took
charge of the case. Descriptions of the
fugitive have been sent broadcast.
"Throw up your hands or I'll blow
off the top of your head," commanded
thp little woman.
OAKLAND, May 13.â With a quick
ness of wit and a during nerve that
would have done many a. strong man
proud, a frail little woman. Mrs. Wil
liam P. Elliott, turned tables to-day
on a burly robber, armed as he was,
and ci-iripellfd him under threat of
death to surrender a prized gold watch
and chain he had stolen.
By clever strategy, Coupled with re
markable coolness, Mrs. Elliott got
hold "of a loaded revolver and boldly
marched the thief out of her home.
In an upstairs' bedroc-m at the rear
of a candy and stationery shop at
10S04. Railroad avenue. East Oakland.
Mrs. Elliott bested the thief. Though
compelled to lead the daylight bur
glar through the house to the bed
room, with an ugly pistol pointed at
hÂ«?r head, the plucky shopkeeper did
net lose her presence of mind for an
Ir.Ftant. WhSlo the unwelcome Invader
was ransacking a bureau drawer, the
housewife edged away and reached
into a washstand drawer, quickly
grabbed a ?!*tol she knew was there
and then bored the muzzle Into the
reck of the crouching thief.

MOUNT EDEN. May 13. â While at
Â¦work under the general merchandise
store of H. Crocker & Co. workmen
this afternoon discovered the skeleton
of a man buried m the soil. This dis
covery revived a story that has been
told in Mount Eden for years and the
mystery of which the skeleton i<Â« sup
posed to solve to some extent-
Years ago when there were few set
tlements in AJamcda County an old
man known as "Kookle" kept a store
in this section. "Kookie" disappeared
one night when he had a lot of money
in his possession. There was ndthing
on the skeleton that was found to
night to identify it. but the people of
this section think that they sre in the
eauh-Ftained bone? the remains of old
â¢"Kookie." .
Kcvalls the Story of a Disappearanoe
That HnÂ« Ilccn Almost En
tirely Forgotten.

A MOUNT EDEN STORK
It transpire? that Hawley's pecula
tions were due entirely to his extrava
gant mode of living. He did not spend
his money on wine or women, but on
clothes und knick-knacks to satisfy his
personal vanity. For Instance, he
wore a Panama hat twice as wide as
anybody's else. He smoked a pipe that
cost $9 and passed out calling cards
that cost 14 a hundred. His clothes
were always of the latest pattern. '
Naturally Hawley could not do all
these things on a salary of %S a week,
and the money had to come "by hook or
crook. His commonest method to get
money was to destroy the tags for
work done by his employers, after col
lecting the money for them, and keep
the money. As there was no other
record of these transactions kept by
the firm, the destruction of these tags
wiped out all evidence of them. In
this way he managed to sper.d $350
without being detected.
Both Mikkelsen and Berry were sat
isfied with the compromise* they had
secured with Hawley. They were will
ing to make some sacrifice on account
of the offender's youth.
- Mother and son refused to talk about
the case this morning after the settle
ment had been made. They preferred
that the affair be not discussed at all.
Hawley was asked if he intended to
leave the university, but he replied
that he had not made any jyans for the
future. His mother ' off ered " the in
formation, however, that he would ac
cept a position In New Mexico, though
she would not disclose the nature of it.
"My son will probably take a po
sition In New Mexico, now that all this
trouble has been cleared up," was all
the mother would say.
SATISFIED WITH TER3IS. .
This effort by Mrs. Hawley to save
her. son from lasting disgrace and Im
prisonment was made at. a great sac
rifice. The note she Indorsed Is secured
by a mortgage on the family home In
Los Angeles, the only property she
possesses. It was understood at first
that Hawley's family was well to do.
but now It seems that a sister, Miss
Agnes Hawley, formerly a school
teacher In Berkeley, is the main support
of a blind father and a mother not ro
bust in health.
to $550.
Hawley's mother arrived from her
home in L.os Angeles this .morning,
having been summoned by her son.
She met her son In a room over
Mikkelson & Berry's store at 2124
Center stm?t, where he .had been kept
prisoner all night by John C. Berry, of
th* firm and Deputy Constable George
Thompson. There was a tearful meet
ing between mother and son, the young
man breaking down completely when
his pnrcnt entered the room.
Negotiations were entered into, how
ever, soon after the meeting and' all
efforts bent to settle the difficulty as
soon ns possible. Hawiey's former em
ployers were not particularly anxious
to prosecute him, and agreed to take
no criminal action If the amount of
his peculations was made good. They
were represented by Attorney Harry
H. Johnscn, who soon secured an
agreement from Mrs. Hawley to indorse
a note for her son for the amount era
bezaled. The note was at once drawn
up and signed by Hawley and Indorsed
by Mrs. Hawley.
MOTHJSK'S SACRIFICE.
BERKELEY, May 13. â By offering
his note for $550, with his mother as
indorse*, Walter E. Hawley, the stu
dent at the University of California
who last night confessed to taking his
employers' money, has escaped prose
cution and probably a long term in the
penitentiary. The compromise was
effected at a meeting this morning of
Hawley, his mother, Mrs. Sarah M.
Hawley. and the members of the firm
of Mlkkelson & Berry, "from whom
Hawley embezzled various amounts of
money that were ascertained to foot up

Berkeley is going to have a Santa Fe
day, too. It is going to welcome the
first train that puffs through its streets.
Not that there is any spirit of rivalry
or selfishness between Berkeley, and
Oakland in this matter Is the town pre
paring to do this thing, but simply be
cause the town will get the first whack
â¢it the train. Berkeley considers that
the coming of this train will be an
event of ae great importance to it as
to Oakland.
A celebration on behalf of Berkeley
Â¦was settled at a meeting of represen
tative citizens last night. It was decid
ed that Berkeley would keep its prom
ise to send a lloat to Oakland on Mon
day, but that a welcoming here would
be just the thing. There is a pretty
station at University avenue and West
street and this will be the scene of the
reception to the first train.
Committees have been appointed to
look after the various details for the
celebration. The depot wil be deco
rated, there will be speechmaking and
cheering. The train is scheduled to
arrive at about 11 o'clock Monday
morning and by that time there will
be a great gathering of townspeople
and school children. The programme
to be carried out during the short stop
of the train has not yet been arranged,
but it will be completed at another
meeting of the citizens Saturday night.
The arrangements are in tho hands of
th<Â» following committee:
Arrangementsâ C. A. Wagner. J. G.
AnlofT, Robert Greig and W. K. Weir.
Decorationsâ R. C. Staats, W". H.

Scanlan's trial was held behind
closed door*. Th<Â» only action' taken in
the oper. was the adoption of resolu
tions ftndins him guilty nnJ Imposing
the fine.
That Soanlan escanod so lightly is
duo to th~ favorable votes of Com
missioners F. C Turner and J. E.
McElroy. Mayor Olney declared that
tho $"f> One was punishment entirely
inadequate and he voted "no" on the
resolution fixing the penalty.
Commissioner Turner's excuse for
voting In favor of the light fine was
â¢hct th* 1 vitmsFes on hoth sides dur
ing Scanlan'p trial had testified that
the policeman did not kick Mulvey
until affÂ»r the hunchback newsboy
hud usÂ»-d much vile epithet in their
quarrel over a lxÂ»t on th? Brltt-'Cor

?ay why he had fa'.M to arrest Mul
vey instead of correcting htm with the
toe of hi* boot.
In face of a protest from Mayor
O!ney. the remaining members of the
Board of Pollct? and Fire Commission
ers this afternoon imposed a fine of
J30 on Policeman John P. Scanlan,
after finding the patrolman guilty of
kicking John J. Mulvoy. a crippled
Dewsbojr. The Commissioners paid
tto attention to the fact that Scan'.an
had violated a rulo of the Police De
partment In betting on a prii?flght.

"News is any current event of gen
eral Interest. Journalism Is the science
of its treatment with relation to the
public. The object of a newspaper is
to make things popular. It has been
argued that it is lowering the tone of
things to do that. That Is the cry fcf
the exoert that "loves art for art's
sake.'
"The newspaper has accomplished
great things in the diffusion of general
Intelligence. It is responsible for the
fact that so large a part of America
is cultured â so much larger than those
countries that have no newspapers.
Journalism is the great profession, and
the newspaper man Justifies his profes
sion because more people go to him for
Justice than to the law courts, more
people go to him for sanitary regula
tions than to the doctors and more peo
ple go to him for general reforms than
to the preachers."
"It is a fixed and 'unalterable purpose
of the United States Government that
not one more acre of fore?t land shall
pass out of Government control. It Is
the definite policy that only the ripened
timber Bhall be cut. The Government
hag reserved sixteen million acres of
forest land, either in temporary with
drawal or permanent. This is to pro
tect the watersheds and to protect our
rainfall." '
"The Aim of Journalism" was the
subject of John McNaughfs address,
during which 'he said: - â¢
"The aim of the newspaper, of strict
Journalism, is simply to publish the
news. Of course, when a man takt3
hold, of a newapaner he tries some time
to infuse some of his own personality,
his own opinions, into it. Just a? his
torians have donp In -their writings.
But It is not the tcsk of a newspaper
to inculcate sound morals or true lit
erature. In hl3 Individual capacity a
newspaper man may do that, but so far
as a newspaper undertakes to compel
people to believe specific doctrines and
attempts to teach morals, politics or re
ligion it lores something of Its true
status as a newspaper.
"People have argued that newspapers
are degenerating. It has been pointed
out that all of the newspapers were
against Tammany in the last New York
election, yet Tammany won. One might
as well say that the churches are de
generating because they were all
against Tammany as well. Truth is.
that when the church or the newspaper
got Into politics it went outside of Its
mission.
"The forestry question is so far
reaching In its consequences to Califor
nia that It is well worthy of the at
tention of our people," said Mr. Mills.
The speaker covered In close detail
the scientific aspect of the subject, de
scribing with much clearness the nat
ural phenomena in the gathering of
moisture in the forests. He declared
that denudation of forests means ster
ility and not fertility, andargued that
the forests do conserve rainfall. Con
cluding. Mr. Mills said:
"Public ownership of forests mÂ«>ans
a public policy of control. Private
ownership means private policy to con
trol.
President Gorrtll officiated at the
post-prandlal entertainment, and pre
sented Mr. Mills, who delivered an able
discourse on the subject. "Do the For

The rate of reinsurance on the over
''due steamship Conemaugh was ad
vanced yesterday to 65 per cent and
â¢hope for her safety is growing fainter
as the days go by without any word
being received from the belated
freighter. The American-Hawaiian
--liner Oregonian made a long passage
and for a time it was hoped that she
had picked up the Conemaugh. The
Oregonian arrived some days ago,
. however, and made no report of hav
ir.g seen the overdue steamer.
It is now seventy-six days since the
Conemaugh, loaded with sugar from |
Honolulu, left Coronel. Honolulu peo
ple are much interested In the steam
ship's fate and speculators at the.
island port are playing the Conemaugh
heavily "not to arrive."

Hebbard also gave Catherine Winston
Beard a divorce from George Ira Beard
for desertion. They were married; in
1892 in Kern County, the desertion oc-,
curring just ten years later.

Leibert, was adjudged guilty of,con

Jojin Maisano. is seeking a divorce
from Maria -Maisano on the ground of
cruelty. In the complaint filed by him
yesterday he says his spouse is far too
strenuous in her*.. methods! of Â¦ Inform
ing him that she is "bossofthe house."
He says that-a short time ago, after
punching him -on the face and , telling
him that he was no good, and that he
would have to pay his board oivget out,
that she was boss, she said to him in a
fiendish manner: "I would like to find
some one to cut you to pieces. I think
I khow a party who will with great
pleasure cut you up into thirty-three
pieces."
\ NEW YORK. May 13. â Bradstreet's
to-morrow will say: Weather condi
tions have been favorable, crop con
ditions have made fair progress and
I retail business has benefited, the Im
! provement extending in some lines to
t reorders from Jobbers. Dry goods
i dealers and grocers note relatively
I greatest activity. Rather more is do
ing in fall goods. . General industry
has remained rather quiet, notably so
! in cotton, Woolen and shoe manufac
! turing." The iron trade is quiete-r as a
j whole, with prices easier. An im
mense area of fall-sown wheat has
had to be abandoned, but this will
I probably go into other crops. Prices
! show a gradual drifting downward
i from the high levels of early spring.
t Foreign trade in breadstuffs is at a
very low ebb, but " exports of high
priced cotton swell trade totals. Rail
j way earnings indicate a 5 per cent de
crease from April, 1903.
Wheat (including flour) exports for
the week ending May 12 are the small
est reported in sixteen years. Corn
receipts arc also small as compared
with last year.
Business failures in the United
States for the week ending May 12
number 201, against 176 last week.
182 in the like week in 1903, 190 in
1902, 192 in 1901 and 155 in 1900. In
Canada failures for the week number
23, against 18 last week and 18 in this
week a year ago.
R. G. Dun & Co.'s Weekly Review of
Trade'to-morrow will say: Seasonable
I weather has restored normal condi
j tions in many branches of retail trade,
but the improvement has not yet ex
tended to wholesale jobbing or manu
facturing departments, except in spe
cial lines. It is difficult to find evi
dences of increased acitivity in any of
the leading industries and there is
more idle machinery. While many of
the features of the business situation
make por comparisons with last year,
it is worthy of note that few Presi
dential years have made a better ex
hibit.
Western hide markets are firm and
active, except gains being fully main
i tained and in many cases holders in
sist on further advances. Receipts of
foreign dry hides have increased, with
out weakening the tone or reducing
demand.
Commercial failures this week in the
United States are 236, against 207 last
week, 202 the preceding week and 196
the corresponding week, last , year.
Failures in Canada number 23, against
27 last week, 16 the preceding week
and 13 last. year.

There is on the coast of Â¦ California a
peculiar family of fish properly known
as surf fish. Emblotocidae, In which the
young are hatched within the body of
the female and borne after the fashion
of higher animals. These fishes re

of the Atlantic Coast and so people
call them "perch* and 'poj-gy.' There
are twenty-two different kinds of fish
here bearing their young of a length
of about two Inches in the early sum

WHEN General Chipman, president of the State
Board of Trade', made Tiis annual report in
March, we extracted much of the valuable
information it gives concerning the State and its re
sources. This report is. now published, as the Year Book
of the "State. It is typographically attractive and is the
most valuable of the many publications designed to ad
vertise California. This is so because- its statistical
information is not available, in any other form. As we
look , to the Mining .Bureau for complete, exact and
reliable information about that industry, because it is
iiot to be found anywhere else, so we must look to this
Year Book of the State Board of-Trade for the exact
facts.. concerning the horticulture and agriculture and
other industries that occupy our people and yield their
wealth.
This Year Book is made attractive by a splendid map
of the State, a birdseye view, of the bay and San Fran
cisco and a large number of halftones that illustrate
scenery and rural industries. The book is complete. It
describes the school and governmental . systems of the

I with a kind of apostrophe to the spir

is his conception and how much more
refined is the conception which affiliates
spirit not upon any form of matter, but
' upon a form of motion. And then the
] paffage goes on to point out that not

showing (using algebraic symbols) that
it Is impossible either to interpret
matter In terms of spirit or spirit in

is to the human intelligence insoluble
so long as there exists the antithesis?

and to point what is the cause of the
confusion in the minds of my oppo

that matter and motion as they exist
in themselves cannot l>e matter and
motion as we know them, they persist
in importing into their own and into

of matter, and thus showing how ab
surd is the Incongruity when conscious

If they would keep ever before them
the fact which I perpetually assert
that matter and motion as existing in

McClure was . gone about five min
utes. When he came back the change
In his demeanor toward Garnett was
remarkable. He insisted upon shaking
hands with him again, placed his hand
in a very friendly way upon the, writ
er's shoulder, asked him how his health
was and made several very pleasing
comments on the stories published
under the name of Garnett. He even
asked him about a pain in the back
the writer had suffered from for some
time. ' Â¦\i.r/ / :
Then Irwin's eyes opened. In his
brief absence McClure had . consulted
his little book.
When they arrived at the Bohemian
Club the first person they met there
was Porter Garnett, one of the best
of California's short story writers. Ir
wln introduced him to McClure and
was considerably surprised to- notice
that the publisher did not appear very
cordial to Garnett, more than one of
whose stories had appeared In the Mc-
Clure magazines. The coolness was
very apparent both to Irwln and to
Garnett, and it was with a sigh of re
lief that they heard McClure ask to be
excused for a few moments while he
retired to another room on a hasty ex
cuse.
Colonel Robert McClure, of magazine
fame, recently paid a visit to this
coast. One of the first persons he call
ed upon after arriving in this city was
W. H. Irwln, a clever writer of short
stories connected with the local press.
He made himself known and, of course.
Irwln set about making the great pub
lisher at home. He insisted that the
publisher should make the Bohemian
Club his headquarters during his visit,
and in order to make him thoroughly
at home, walked to the clubrcoms with
him. â¢ On the way to the Post street
home of the Bohemians, McClure asked
Irwln to step Into a bookstore with
him. He did so and saw the publisher
pull a little book from his inside pock
et, rapidly turn over the leaves and
then ask for a copy of a well known
Californlan author's latest novel. Ir
win saw that the book consulted by
McClure contained the names of every
literary persc-n in San Francisco, the
titles of their best efforts In the liter
ary line and other data connected with
them.

As a good foil lor the above article there is a "Fable
for the Foolish," by Nicholas Nemo, entitled "How to
Succeed, Though a Lamentable Failure," which will pro
voke much more than a passing smile even while giving
food for serious thought.
Add to all this the second installment of Headon Hill's
story of the dreaded "Third Section," and how it safe
guards the life of the Czar from 'the web of plot and
counterplot that is being constantly woven in Russia,
jind it will not be. hard to realize why. "By a Hair's

"the saucy full-page painting of Ida Romer Shawhan,

other of the musical novelties which are innovations of
the Sunday Call's color printing.
Again there is "Company E's Green Bird of Freedom,"
by Albert Sonnichsen, which, though it has a semi
humorous title, is in reality a creation of unusual dra
matic strength.
But for genuine humor, for mirth provoking word
pictures combined with perfect diction, there is a quaint
ly' illustrated article by Jerome K. Jerome, the "Mark
Twain of England," which he ,has called by the compre
hensive and- highly attractive title, "Men, Women and

STORIES there arc a-plenty that are read and for
gotten almost in the same moment they are
finished. Again there are other stories that are
sc powerful in the strength and sweep of the scenes
and characters they depict that they make an indelible
impress upon the mind of the reader, to be recalled with
startling viyjdness long years afterward. They, are the
essence of truth and human experience, good and evil.
They are of the life we live in our inner conscience,
each unto himself. Such a story is "The Fruits of Toil,"
by Norman Duncan, which will ,be published complete
in the Sunday Call to-morrow. . â¢
From every word contained therein there is gathered
the m>'Stery and the fascination of the story that has
gone before. They hint of how tremendous is the sub-<
jeet he has chosen and how impressively he has handled
it, even though they do not tell of the. characters them
selves, of the terrors of Quid Nunc, of Stride's ten thou
sand hazards with Fate off the tickle rocks of the Mull,
of the riddle of the Seven Thunders and the pathetic
fantasy of the ship of glass with the seven stars in the
rigging, nor of the inexorable struggle that has gone
on in the human breast .since the beginning of time. All
of this makes up one of the most powerful stories ever
published exclusively in the Sunday Call.
But the Sunday Call contains other matter of equal
interest to everyone. There is, for instance, "Siclone
Clark," by Frank H. Spearman, which is one of the
oddest stories in the whole scries of his new railroad
SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.

History may be repeated in the experience of Russia.
The Japanese generals display some of the tactics of
Bonaparte in their celerity of movement and their
accomplishment of what is thought impossible. On the
Yafu they won by dragging guns up heights supposed to
be impossible, and planting and serving them in posi
tions that commanded the Russian forces, who, finding
them 1 inaccessible, were compelled to retreat.
The Japanese facility of movement and capacity- to
march and fight^ scale mountains and fight, ford rivers
and fight, renew the military traditions of the career of
the Little Corporal. It may be said, in response to this,
that Bonaparte met his Waterloo. But that was the
result of his dream of a continental empire and mastery
of the world. Japan has no such dream.,. Her opera
tions are defensive only. She is fighting not for Asiatic
empire, but for her own independence. If she,overcome
Russia, as likely she will, and then imitate Bonaparte in
his decree of Berlin, it will be time to predict her
Waterloo.
That *he now has the good will of the world is proved
by the state of her credit. The Japanese loan has been
heavily over-subscribed in New York and the subscript
tion in London is twenty times over the amount to be
placed, there. Money iÂ» not sentimental. It has noth
ing to do with national or racial sympathy. These
over-sub?criptions are expressive- of confidence in the
military and physical resources of Japan and of the
conviction that her present advantage, in the war mean*
her final victory.
Investors in the war boitds of a nation are moved
by the same considerations that influence them in taking
the bonds of industrial enterprises. These are, the
strength and safety .of the security. Japan's security
seems so good that her loan is over-subscribed in the
two money centers of the western world. This means,
that a similar loan, many times larger, would be taken.
The confidence of financiers will be increased by Rus
sia's course in destroying Dalny rather than defend it.
It is entirely likely that her hinterland city â Harbiuâ
may follow Dalny in committing suicide.
Of course, the opinion of military experts as to the
final outcome of the present war has been affected by
the vastly superior power of -Russia. It has been con
ceded that such superiority would finally wear out Japan.
But, that is by no means certain. Japan and Russia
are in much the same relation to each other that Great
Britain and Spain were in the lime of Philip II. Spain
was then a world empire. It held a large part of Italy,
the Low Countries. Central and South America and
islands in every sea. Philip made the boast: "I am the
richest baptized man on earth. The sun never sets on
my dominion." Great Britain was small and weak, but
her insular people were patriotic and her sailors were
brave and skillful. Military experts, however, taking
into consideratotf the dfference between her and Spain
in population and resources were sure that in the long
run she would be worn out. ''But she was not. The
"Invincible Armada" was an expression of Spanish,
power, -but it went to the bottom and the ships of Drake
sailed over its bones.
THE great explosions heard by the Japanese and
by them supposed to be in Port Arthur and its
harbor prove to have been at Dalny and were
caused by the destruction of the great docks and parts
of the city itself by the Russians. They preferred to
destroy many millions of dollars in their property
rather than defend it. This is a repetition of Moscow.
But the circumstances Â¦ are different. Bonaparte was
caught far from his base, and by destroying their own
city and desolating their own country the Russians
lianded their campaign over- to be fought against the
Corsican by famine and winter. Now Russia is far from
her base and her enemy is in close touch with his.
The destruction of Dalny is a Russian loss, with no
compensating advantage in embarrassment of the enemy.
It is an impressive evidence of military weakness.
Dalny had been expensively created to be for Russian
Asia all that Hongkong is to Great Britain in China,
and* Calcutta and Bombay in India.' Millions were lav
ished to create a great commercial port that was to be
the seat of Russian trade and hÂ«r Asiatic capital and
stronghold. The loss of sea power to Japan put it in
peril in. front, and the losses on land left its rear defense
in* doubt. Rather than defend it the city is destroyed.
It is the same policy that preferred to dismantle a war
ship in a Chinese harbor rather than steam out and
fight. . It will be remembered that the first sign of
weakness in Spain, in our recent war with that power,
was an order to naval commanders to sink their own
ships.

and this character is sustained by its judicial and judi

land anywhere or to promote the interests of any special
industry. Its text and figures as truthfully represent
industrial facts as its illustrations do' the scenic and

Hugh McCaffrey and his tremendous
thirst were given four months by
Judge Mogan. While a brewery wagon
was standing at Leidesdorff and Sac
ramento streets last Thursday morning
Mr. McCaffrey pilfered from it eight
bottles of beer, but had consumed only
the contents of one of them when his
arrest occurred.
"Four months for one bottle is purty
stiff, ain't it?" he inquired.
"If you had drunk the other seven
I might have reduced the ratio," re
plied the Judge, "but you must re
member that it costs this court as
much to try a person for stealing a
pin as for purloining a crowbar."

Clara Evans, held in cuBtody since
April 16 to serve as a witness for the
prosecution in the Ford-Pearson case
of attempt to murder, was restored to
freedom yesterday on condition that
she return to court on June 13 to prove
that her expressed intention to reform
is sincere.
"The new leaf for me, your Honor,"
said Clara to Judge Mogan. "I'm
through with monkey business for
keeps. The Jail has done me a world
of good, and I'm not sorry you kept
me there. I've had time to think, you

tween A. W. Parragon, soldier, and
Harry Stewart, civilian, the boudoir of
Miss Sadie Mclntyre at 37 Hinckley
alley bore striking resemblance to the
Orpheum stage as the curtain descends
upon "Pals." The mirror was in frag
ments and most of the furniture fit
only to serve as firewood. But the in
trinsic loss sustained by Miss Mclntyre
was as nothing,* she 'declared, when
sized: up against 'the self-esteem of
which she was deprived by having the
rumpus occur in her apartment. Â¦
"How did it all come to pass?" Judge
Mogan asked Miss Mclntyre.
"This here soldier," was the reply,
"came to my door and said he had been
sent by a comrade with a message for
Sadie and, thinking he meant me, I in
vited him In. Then I learned that It was
another lady named Sadie he wanted to
see, and When I politely requested him
to . go and look for her he started in to
make a rough house. "Harryâ Mr.
Stewart, I meanâ heard the noise and
ran In to protect me, and while he was
trying to make peace this here soldier
broke everything he could lay his
hands upon. I don't care so much for
the loss of the furniture as for what
the other people In the iiouse will
think of me. It Just breaks my heart."
The soldier did not deny guilt as
charged, but offered to pay for all he
broke exclusive of Miss Mclntyre's

Patrolman Isaacs was stargazing
when he saw something white and
elongated and bulky drop from a third

a case of murder or suicide, he rushed
to the spot and tenderly bent over the
inanimate object, and then he jumped
backward, pressing his nostrils and
emitting language that Is absolutely

he was on the inner side of the window

Since the arrest on Monday of S. P.
Wetzel at the Richelieu Hotel., where
he had posed as a private detective
and was later found ransacking bu
reau drawers in the room of A. Abru
hamson, the proprietor, Detectives
Harper and Armstrong have been In
vestigating the young man's past. As
a result he was booked at the City
Prison yesterday on â¢ four charges of
burglary and two of petty larceny and
the officers say that the end is not yet.
The police charge Wetzel with en
tering the room of J. E. O'Hearn,
Browning Hotel, 1001 Sutter street,
April 14, and stealing about ' $250
worth of clothing; entering the room
of Nathan Fisher, 1233 Polk street,
on May 2 and stealing $25 worth of
clothing; entering the room of C. r>.
Chase, 736 Bush street, on May 3 and
stealing $500 worth of Jewelry, *nd
entering the room of Frank Turner,
Plymouth Hotel, Bush and Jones
streets, on May 5 and stealing $30j9
worth of clothing. Most of the stole"n
property has been recovered and Wet
zel identified as the one who sold it.
He is also accused of stealing an
overcoat belonging to Grant C. Free
man on March 17 from Golden Gate
Hall and taking a gold watch from
a locker in the Young Men's Christian
Association gymnasium. Other arti
cles were stolen from lockers in the
same gymnasium and Wetzel is sus
pected of doing the jobs. The over
coat and watch have been recovered
and Wetzel identified as the seller.
Wetzel, although scarcely out of his
teens, has a record. In 1903 he was
arrested' in Martinez for burglary, but
the charge was reduced to petty lar
ceny and he was sent to jail for six
months. Three years prior to that
time he was arrested in this city for
sttaling bicycles, but through the in
fluence of his adopted parents was not
prosecuted. He dresses well and is
not bad looking and each day a large
number of young women call at the
City Prison to-see him.

Vastly disproportionate in both weight
and bulk to its pecuniary value is the
plunder labeled exhibit A in the case
Patrolman Rice is pressing against
John McCann and Peter Gunn in the
court of Judge Mogan. It consists of
seventy-five pounds of pig iron, and in
open market it would not bring more
than $1. But the policeman avers that
it is only as a particle in the mass of
ferruginous spoils surreptitiously taken
from various foundries in this city. by
the defendants above named and an ac
complice as yet uncaptured. The pilfer
ing has been going on for months, he
says, and only by the shrewdest kind
of detective workday others, were its
perpetrators finally ? bagged with the
goods in their possession.
McCann is lame,, and his crippled con
dition enabled him to act as a "stall,"
or forerunner and lookout, for Gunn,
who did the actual stealing. It was
McCann's share of the work to find out
where the intended plunder was lying
and how It could 'be most expeditiously
and safely stolen, and then . to. keep
watch and divert suspicion from Gunn
while the transfer of the heavy stuff
wag being made. To accomplish this a
horse and cart were necessary, and it
was In the employment of these aids
that McCann, Gunn & Co. showed their
cunning.
After the preliminaries had been ar
ranged by McCann and the coast was
sufficiently clear Gunn would drive a
load of sand to the foundry in which
the coveted iron lay, and as metal
foundries always have use for sand he
was treated as a welcome visitor. So
he began unloading the sand near
where the plunder lay, and in this labor
he was helped by the third man, still at
large, who Invariably accompanied him.
When they had unloaded the sand one
of them would slyly cover the bottom
of the cart with a layer of iron pigs,
while the other would with equal sly
ness spread enough sand over them to
effect their perfect concealment. When
this was done any one could look into
the cart and see only what seemed to
be the sand-covered bottom. Then the
apparently empty vehicle was driven
away and the Iron disposed of.
It was from the foundry at 213 First
street that 'the seventy-five pounds of
iron used as evidence against McCann
and Gunn was taken, and Officer Rice
had been on their track several days
before he caught them fairly in the act.
Judge Mogan has set the case for hear
ing next Tuesday.
Of the operations of the great Calu
met & Hecla mine the Mining World
says:
To date the Calumet & Hecla has yielded a
total of. approximately 1.725, 000. 000 . pounds
of copper. It has the distinction of having
made the largest amount of copper of any
mine in America. Only the Rio Tlnto, In
Spain, which has been worked for centuries,
having been a producer hundreds of years
btfore the Calumet & Hecla was discovered.
but passes it in point of production. At the
present time the Calumet & Hecla is stamping
end dressing Â¦ about 0000 tons of rock a day.
There is little likelihood of an Increase or
decrease until the work of rebuilding the stamp
mills Is completed, which will not be for two
years. When the mills are completely re
modeled the Calumet & Hecla will have twen
ty-eirht modern steam stamp*, capable of
treating over 80Q0 tons of rock daily. The
reconstructed mills * will greatly reduce the
stumping charges and curtail the loss of cop
per in the tailings, embodying the results of
over forty years' practical and many years
of experimental work.
The output of .the big mine during the
calendar year 1003 amounted to 7<3,490.8<13
pounds of refined copper, compared to 81.248,
73U pounds in 1802. The decrease of 4.757.S70
pounds or over 6.8 per cent, will be variously
construed, according to the standpoint of the
party making the deductions, but It really has
no particular significance. The efforts of the
management during the last three years have
been directed toward the reduction of operating
expenses, rather than to stimulation of the
ovtput. In these efforts the company has met
with success and. without cutting wages or
eliminating any of the beneficent works which
have done so much to promote the welfare of
the community. It Is now making Its copper
at a smaller cost per pound than at any time
since the boom of a few years ago.. During
the last ten years thÂ« production of the Calu
met & Hecla has averaged slightly In excess
of 80.700.000 pounds of refined copper per
annum The largest output In the 'history of
the mine was made In 1S99. when It came
close to 00.000,000 r>ounds.

D. W. Irwin Will Launch and Christen
a New Flyer To-Morrow at
Spreckels Lake.
Owing to a lack of wind it was im
possible for the model yacht owners to
â¢ail their craft last Sunday on Spreck
els Lake, Golden Gate Park. For
that reason no races were held. There
will be some good races to-morrow if
the wind is at all favorable. ; <i '.
D. W. Irwin will launch and chris
ten h!s new model on Sunday. If she
calls as well as she looks she should
prove fast.
- W. E. Candy has sold the Zulu and
is building a new boat. . Many are of
the opinion that the Zulu would have
proved a winner had she been given
a fair trinl by her owner.
In some unaccountable way Vice
Commodore London's Imp and Adams
â¢V Todd's Sanlee were cracked almost

undergoing repairs and is expected to
'bo out on Sunday.
Collier Bros.' sloop Fannie Is prov

and will play a prominent part in fu

L. S. Adams Is draughting the lines
for a sloop he claims will be faster
tiian his speedy Santee.
William Hoeckner. one of the club's
oldest members, has again announced
that he will build no more models. He
â¢h:is built seven since the lafet an
nouncement two years ago. He de
clares this is final, but the club^nem
hrrs hope not.
The yacht owners have been ham
l^erpd by the numerous spectators who
crowd the path used by them and
their assistants. The races can be
eeen just as well from the other path
end the boats could be handled better
TKith less interference.

The work of Umpire Jim McDonald
has been faultless since he began . lo
wield the indicator in this city. Al
though ill and infirm and fit for the
hospital, Jim has appeared time and
again on the field and umpired ball of
which no one has reason to complain.
In fact, .there Have been Jess kicks, reg
istered in the nast few weeks than at
any other time during the season.
Seattle has not lived up to expecta
tions. The team made a great impres
sion when seen here, and- many fans
conceded the pennant to Wilson ere
the season had well begun. But, like
all slugging aggregations, the Seattle
ites have their off days frequently, and
when they go up against a ball team
that plays the game steadily they gen
erally find themselves outplayed and
outclassed.
San Francisco has proved itself a
good sticking aggregation, but it takes
a whole lot of lilts' to score a reason
able amount of runs for. the Harris
bunch. They lack that team work and
that gincer which characterize the
play of the Oakland and Tacoma.teams.
Then they are slow on the bases, hence
many solid base hits are wasted ] in
every game.
Three clubs. Tacoma, Oakland and Los
Angeles, are separated by but a few
games, and the leadership is liable to
change at any time. Already the head
line position has switched on four oc
casions. Tacoma has held the lead
longer than her two rivals, Oakland
and Los Angeles, and since Jumping to
the front the last time the Tigers are
playing the game of their lives.
Oakland is fast cutting down the lead
held by the northerners, and if nothing
goes wrong with Peter in the next
month or so he will surely be perched
at the top of the ladder. Hard luck has
interfered with the forward advance of
the Oakland veteran in the last few
weeks, otherwise - Mike Fisher would
not be so securely entrenched in the
lead.

Barge and Rubber Ankles, pronounced
the best looking brace of greyhounds
in America, will meet to-morrow. The
winner will be eligible for. the final
against Pocatelli. Barge has great
speed and cleverness, but he Is con
sidered somewhat fainthearted by
coursing authorities. The dainty Rub
ber.Ankles shows. great stamina. Im
proving as she. runs down Into a stake.
It will probably take the full five
courses to decide . the winner. The
coursing will commence to-morrow
upon the arrival of the 10:15 train. The
Honest John, Â¦ Me \>y, Duhallow. Rural Ar-
ing a warning note against the use
of powerful stimulants externally, on
the muscles, or internally on the heart,
to accelerate the speed of greyhounds.
Turfmen are taking severe measures
in the same direction, as they know
such practices strike at the very foun
dation of any sport. In the case of
greyhounds it Injures the running dogs
and must impair the breed of grey
hounds for years to come. In addition
to this it will take from coursing the
support on which it has thrived in
the past. Bettors will not risk their
money if the practice becomes general
while honest coursing men will refuse
to enter their dogs where they will
meet competitors that are running on
something which training and pure
food will not develop.
It is a short-sighted policy to bring
off a small betting coup In which a few
paltry dollars are Involved and which
may mean the end of an ancient sport.
The California coursing men are as
certaining quietly the feelings of their
Eastern friends In regard .to running
the. American Waterloo here. If the
Eastern owners will send their grey
hounds to this edge of the continent
a strong effort will be made to secure
the classic event. It has never been
run here.
This week's meeting at Ingleside
Coursing Park will extend over two
days, a 112-dog stake making up the
card. The running will commence to
day at 11:30 o'clock. The sport will be
resumed to-morrow at 11 o'clock. The
entries include Doc Burns. Red Pepper,
Conroy, Pasha Pleasant, -Black Coon,
Ragged Actor. Homer Boy, Reckless

It is probable that sc-me'of the lead
ins amateurs of Great Britain will
come over to this country to take part
in the Olympian golf" championship
contests to be held at the St. Louis
Exposition in September;
At the approaching championship
meeting at Sandwich the teeing grounds
are to be set back to their farthest
limits and golfers will watch with In
terest how average drivers come ] out
with limit tees j and rubber balls. In
previous years there has been com
plaint on the part of amateurs and
professionals that the strain of such
long, and high driving as Is. required
In the Sandwich course is toohard on
some competitors.
Both players demonstrate the fact that
men who have \>een distinguished in
other sports take kindly to golf and ex
cel in it. Fairbanks was a fine crick
eter, being a member of the Cambridge
University eleven in his undergraduate
days, and Harvey was a sprinter, hav
ing held the public school record for the
120-yard hurdle race.
Miss Mabel Higgins of the Midlothian
Golf Club, Chicago, holder of the
women's championships of Southern
California and Florida, wasj beaten 3
up 2 to play in the opening round of
the women's championship at Troon,
Scotland. She was unlucky in being
drawn against Miss Rhona Adair, the
English woman champion, and so being
put out of further participation in the
contest. ~ '*.;[Â¦
Walter J. Travis, the national ama
teur champion: John Moller Jr.. Simeon
Ford and E. M. Bycrs are in Europe.
Travis, Moller. and. Byers will take part
in the contest for the amateur cham
pionship of Great Britain, which begins
on the 30th inst. on the Sandwich links
In the south of England. â¢ Simeon Ford
is known best as a witty speaker, but
he Is also an enthusiastic player on
the links of the Apawamis Golf Club
at Rye. J. Moller Jr., Mrs. Moller, W.
J. Travis and Simeon Ford go first to
Scotland, where they will play on the
St. Andrew's links and other well
known courses. Toward the end of the
month they will reach Sandwich and
practice there a little before the cham
pionship event. Travis has played on
the Sandwich course before. He ex
pects* to return to New York at the
end of June and to defend his title as
amateur champion of the United States
in September.
Three lnterclub canoe races will be
held and the season will conclude with
an open championship contest. All the
races are to be with handicaps and the
eeries or any one race may be entered
by any genuine sailing canoe owned on
the bay. The first race of the series
Mill be held over the triangular course,
having a length of six miles, of the
Oakland Canoe Club in the estuary.
The second race will take place over
the triangular six-mile course of the
Encinal Yacht Ciub, off the south shore
of Alameda, and the third will be over
a course four and a half miles to wind
ward and four and a half miles to lee
\rard. on the lower waters of the creek
end the bay of San Francisco. The
championship race will be over an
eighteen-mile neutral course on the
tstuary and the bay.
The winds were so light last Satur
day and Sunday that the first race of
the San Francisco Yacht Club fleet
from Vallejo to Sausalito proved unin
teresting. The only yachts that
reached Vallejo on Saturday night were
tJie flagship Challenger, the schooner
S'artha, the sloops Annie. Surprise and
Alice, and the little yawl Witch. The
schooner Chispa, with the sloops Nellie
and Curlew, started from Sausalito on
Eaturday afternoon, but were "hung
up" near Red" Rock. They dropped an
chor in Paradise Cove for the night.
The small yawl Witch and the little
eloop Alice left Vallejo at 8:36:30 on
Sunday morning, the rest following at
10:13 to 10:30. The sloop Annie started
at 10:22:30, the sloop Challenger at
10:24:30, the sloop Surprise at 10:26:30
and the schooner Martha at 10:29:30.
The Challenger crossed the finishing
line off the clubhouse at Sausalito at
4:19 p. m., in an elapsed time of 5 hours
Â£4 minutes 30 seconds. The sloop Alice
crossed the finishing line at 4:30 p. m.,
her elapsed time J>eingr 7 hours 53 min
utes 30 seconds. Deducting her allow
ance of two hours, Alice's corrected
time was 5 hours 53 minutes 30 seconds,
or 1 minute better than that of the
Challenger. Alice won the first and
Challenger the second cup. The other
four boats did not finish.
The canoeists are looking forward to
one of the liveliest seasons they have
had for several years. Though the En
cinal Yacht Club members have given
up interest almost entirely in yachting,
several of them own racing canoes.
Several members of the Olympic Boat
Club also own canoes, ana a series of
races between craft of the three clubs
have been' arranged by a Joint commit
tee of the Oakland Canoe Club and the
Encinal Yacht Club.
At the house of the San Francisco
Yacht Club at Sausalito there will be
ea entertainment to-night for tha bene
fit of the members who do not own
yachts nor form part of thÂ« regular
crew cf eay craft. It consists of a bril
liard tournament, games and other
amusements.
To-morrow will be an open, date on
the EChedules of ths San Francisco,
Ccrlnthlan, California and South Bay
Yacht clubs. The tide floods all morn
ing, high water being at 12:21 p. m. at
Fort Point. This is favorable for a
cruise to the upper bay and many
yachts will be found at Paradise Cove
and off the El Campo shore to-morrow.
The opening of the season will- take
place this afternoon at the clubhouse
of the Oakland Canoe Club on Sessions
Basin, Eaet Oakland. Owing to the re
cent bereavement In the family of Com
modore Charles Stewart, the affair will
be quiet, being confined to canoe races,
the dance given regularly on opening
day being called off. The fleet of the
Oakland Canoe Club includes R. B.
Bain Jr.'s Vitesse, F. L. Rodgers* Pir
cte, Charles L. Taylor Jr.'s Nereid,
Frank Paul's Codia and J. R. Henna's
Brownie.
The Pacific cricket eleven will play
its first regular match of the season

E. H. Lanncwe, Dr. O. N. Taylor, H.
D. Bowly, W. Petherick, F. Lewtn,
Norman Logan, T. W. Bewley and H.
N. Storrs or E. H. Wllkea. The San

In cricket matches of any importance
in Great Britain it is the usual practice
to have sheets of white canvas
stretched at each end of the field in a
line with the wickets. These have
never been used by cricketers here,
though they are a great help to the
batsmen, preventing people moving
about in a line with the wickets and
distracting their eyes. It is proposed
to set up these screens on the Alameda
ground and it is likely they will be
ready for use to-morrow.
The official list of members of the
Santa Cruz Cricket and Athletic Club

In last Sunday's match between the
San Francisco County and Alameda
teams the umpire was blamed for in
consistency In his decisions. In one
case the bowler delivered a ball which
struck the batsman's body, but the
umpire's decision was that the bats
man was not out, as the ball, if un
hindered in its course, would have
missed the wickets by a foot or two.
In the other case the same bowler de
livered a ball which was stopped by
the batsman's body and the umpire
gave the batsman out. But in that
case the umpire believed the ball was
dropping and would have taken ths
wicket had it not been impeded. It
should be remembered that though the
technical term for obstructing a ball is
"leg before wicket," the law reads.
"The striker Is out. If with any part
of his person he stop the ball, which.
In the opinion of the umpire at the
bowler's wicket, shall have been pitched
in a straight line from It to the striker's
wicket and would have hit It â leg be
fore wicket."

A handicap over eighteen holes will
engage the attention of the men and a
putting competition will occupy the
ladies on the course of the San Rafael
Golf Club to-day.
The course in Happy Valley
was in fair condition for the
competition for the men's amateur
championship of the Northern Califor
nia Golf Association last Saturday.
Getting off the course was, however,
heavily penalized on account of the
thick growth of grass. The general im
pression among the players was that
Harvey's second victory in the cham
pionship competition proves him to be
the most brilliant golfer in the State.
Though not so imperturbably steady as
C E. Maud, he Is capable of more bril
liant play than the winner of the men's
amateur championship of the Pacific
Coast Golf Association in March, 1903.
It is a curious coincidence that Walter
Fairbanks, who has held the amateur
championships of Southern California
and of the Pacific Coast Golf Associa
tion, comes from the same public school
in Englandâ Clifton College. It is also
a striking illustration of the fact that
golf is a game for all ages, for at Clif
ton, Walter Fairbanks was the form
master and A. G. Harvey the pupil.

MORRIS PARK SELECTIONS.
The recent judgment of the Supreme
Court granting a new trial to Minnie
Ad^ams, convicted of the murder of her
child and sentenced to imprisonment
for life, mainly on -the ground that
the"- jury while deliberating on its ver
dict was not kept together in one
room, has determined Judge Lawlor
to carry into effect a scheme that has
been in his mind for some time.
The Judge wants the juryroom' at
the Hall of Justice made habitable.
To that end he desires that the floor
be carpeted, beds provided and other
accessories supplied. If practicable
he would have a kitchen on the same
floor, so that meals could be' cooked
for detained jurors.
Within the last two years Judge
Lawlor has had the juryroom consid
erably enlarged and improved. Su
pervisor ftea, chairman of the Build
ing Committee, at the Judge's request,
made an examination of the juryroom
yesterday and promised to do his ut
most toward carrying out the"sug
gested plan.

PELMAR PARK SELECTIONS.
With the wet season over and the
new green at Golden Gate Park in the
best possible condition, the singles and
doubles tournaments scheduled to be
played by the members of the San
Francisco Scottish Bowling Club arc
â¢well under way. The dates have been
fixed for closing the various rounds
and some interesting matches will be
seen each Saturday. â¢
It was decided during the week to
allow two additional weeks in which
to finish the preliminary round of the
singles', thus making the closing of
each of the other rounds two weeks
later.
In the doubles the two preliminary
round matches have been completed
and in the first round there are eight
matches, four of which have been
played. This round closes May 21.
Two of the club's most expert bowl
ers will not be able to participate in
the tournaments. Andrew Foreman
has left for Scotland and John Mc-
Laren will do so shortly. Moffatt and
Foreman were considered by many to
be the strongest team in the doubles
tournament. They won their first
round match easily. Foreman's de
parture leaves Moffatt, the club cham
pion, without a partner.
McLaren is out of the doubles, hav
ing been beaten In the first round, but
was expected to play a prominent part
in the singles.
It seems likely that Yf C Lawson,
one of the club's strongest players,
may also be without a partner. He
drew Alex Craig and the latter has
not been to the rinks for several
months. The withdrawal of Mr. Law
son would put Dr. Hamilton and W.
R. Eaton in the semi-finals without
playing a match. The winner of this
match will get a default from Fore
man an,d Moffatt in the second round-
In the first round J. P. Taylor and
W. H. Stewart will meet Alex Hay and
A. McNalr. J. S. Webster and G. C.
Patterson will be pitted against Jo
seph Gray and the Rev. W. K. Guth
rie. Charles Adams and James Gray
are scheduled to meet E- J. Clinton
and A. A. Me Vicar. In the last match
of the round the opposing teams will
be Y. C. Lawson and Alex Craig and
Dr. Hamilton and W. R. Eaton.
Two Tournaments Are In Full Swtns
on the Pieturesone Green in
the ParU.
SCOTTISH BOAVIJERS ENTER
WITH ZEST INTO PASTIME
There will be an interesting strug
gle in the singles, for Schmidt and
Long, the most promising young
players of the California Club, are en
tered. When they meet a match well
worth seeing will result. Both boys
are "stroky" players and . brilliancy
will take the place of long rallies.
Marius Hotchklss, the winner of last
year's tournament, is a steady player,
but on form either Schmidt or Long
figures to beat him. In the doubles
the Long brothers and Schmidt and
Cunha are the strongest teams. The
singles will be played this morning on
the California Club courts and the
doubles next Saturday.
The finals of the handicap doubles
commenced on the California Club
courts last Sunday will be played to
morrow. A class singles will be started
on the park courts, the first and sec
ond classes being the attraction to
morrow.
An interesting match is anticipated
when Herbert Schmidt and Harry
Rolf e meet Chester "â Smith and Ray
Cornell in the finals for the directors'
cups. Schmidt and Rolfe have won
the trophies once and success to-mor
row would give them a good lead in
the race. Smith and Cowell are de
termined to down the "pony" team.
If they play as they have since they
joined forces they will stand an excel
lent chance of doing so. Smith and
Cowell play a steady game. Rolfe
also plays the same style of game,
while Schmidt Is expected to. furnish
the brilliancy. The match will be
played early in' the afternoon.
.The class singles tournament to be
held by the Golden Gate Club did not
attract as large a number of entries
as usual. There is a noticeable fall-
Ing off in the second ar\d third classes.

The event of importance this week
will be the annual Academic Athletic
League championships. The High
School boys will meet in a series of
doubles and singles matches to settle
the question of supremacy between
them. The schools have representa
tives in both singles and doubles. The
drawings for the tournaments resulted
as follows: . . ."* .
-Many tournament tennis matches
will be played on the courts during
this month. One. tourney has already
been played since the first of the

First of ' the . Academic Athletic
League Championships.
High * School" Boys Meet To-Day in
TOURNAMENT TENNIS PLAY
ENGAGES ALL- TILE EXPERTS
The association received a telegram
from Secretary Sullivan of the Amateur
Athletic Union of America requesting
that two. representative athletes from
California be sent to take part in' the
American Athletic "Union 'championship,
events at St. Louis on June 2, 3 and 4.
By unanimous vote, It was decided to
send AL Plaw, the famous hammer
thrower, and O. F. Snedigar of Berke
ley, the 100-yard sprinter and broad
jumper. These men are looked upon
as representative athletes of the State
and are expected to make a great show-
Ing at the meet.
It was also decided to tax each club
of the association the sum of $10 in aid
of the Olympian games. A swimming
tournament will be held at the Lurline
Baths some time next month for the
same cause, and the members of the
association are planning to hold sim
ilar entertainments within the next
two months, in order that California
may send back her best athletes to
compete in the great Olympian games
at St. Louis in August.
The light must be held under the
amateur rules. Manager Coffroth will
be compelled to file a statement with
the association not later than five days
after the light 'itemizing each bill and
showing exactly how much money was
taker, in at the door and what dispo
sition was made of the said sum. The
contestants will be allowed training
expenses and will receive a trophy.
Xo boxers who have taken part in
any event held by any of the suspended
amateur clubs will be allowed to "ap
pear in preliminaries to the main
event. Both Berger and Rodenbach
must satisfy the association that they
are r.ot interested in promoting the
fight financially, and must prove that
they receive no money out of "the re
ceipts. ..
Amateur boxing will be tolerated no
longer by the Pacific Athletic Associa
tion. That was practically settled last
night when the executive board met
and refused to take the San Francisco
Athletic Club back into the fold. The
question will have to be voted on again
at the annual meeting of the associa
tion, but the sentiment was virtually
voiced last night, and boxing will no
more bo recognized on the Pacific
Coast as an amateur sport.
The San Francisco Club applied for
reinstatement and the question was
taken up and .thoroughly discussed.
Secretary Herbert Hauser stated that
past experience had taught the asso
ciation that the boxers were all out
for the money, and that they could
not b* managed under the amateur
rules, as boxing does not lend itself to
amateurism. The vote was unanimous,
and it means that boxing as an ama
teur sport is practically dead after the
Berger-Rodenbach match is settled.
James Coffroth, the promoter of
fistic contetts, applied for a sanction
to hold .the Berger-Rodenbach match in
this city on the 25th inst. After much
discussion, it was granted under cer
tain conditions. The association re
serves the right to name all the offi
cials for the contest and insists that
William Greer Harrison, president of
the Olympic Club, shall be one of
them.

day, June 5, on which day a cycllnjc
meet is to be held. The programme
follows: One-mile handicap bicycle
race; two-mile handicap bicycle race;
five-mile handicap bicycle race; three
mile handicap motor cycle race; five
mile 1 handicap motor cycle race, and
five-mile speed trial for automobiles.
The clubs in Reno, San Jose. Sacra
mento and this city will compete in
Australian pursuit race for a valuable
trophy.
\ The events on June 3 are to be
such a3 to show the qualities and ca
pacity of the motor cars, while those
on the second day will be of a more
spectacular and hair-raising kind, like
ly to interest the general spectator.
The long-distance race will be for
touring cars carrying either four men
or two passengers plus an amount of
dead weight equal to two more. As the
quantity of fuel consumed during the
race will be an Important element in
determining its result, the gasoline in
the tanks will be measured carefully
before the start and after the finish.
Economy of power and other qualities
will also be considered in this event,
which will be over a distance of twenty
or possibly thirty miles, and open to
steam and gasoline cars.
There will be an Australian pursuit
race on each day of the meet, one be
ing for touring cars in ordinary con
dition and the other for the same ve
hicles stripped for racing. The racea
for touring cars in their normal state
and carrying a full load of passengers
are intended to show the practical use
fulness of the automobile. There will
be a race for touring cars without ton
neaus in light condition for a long
distance trip. The committee is devot
ing considerable attention to ihese
events. There will also be interesting
matches between the steam carriages
and the gasoline vehicles.
It is expected the disagreement be
tween the two automobile clubs in Los
Angeles will prevent any meet being
held this spring in Southern Califor
nia, and will cause the automobilists
of that part of the State to flock to
the San Francisco races and show.
The betting ring at Ingleside will be
divided off into forty or more spaces
for the display of motor cars and ac
cessories.
A committee consisting of L. P.
Lowe, chairman; S. G. Buckbee and
C. C. Moore, is at work on the pro
gramme of events for the combined
show and race meet to be held under
the management of the Automobile
Club of California on the Ingleside
track on June 3, 4 and 5.
Heine Spies had trouble with his shoe i
Â«rinÂ£s yesterday at Recreation Park. I
Ip the seventh they became all tan
gjetl up, and. of course, Henry was
fprced to rig them up properly. It mat
tered not if a few Qaklander? rested on
ihe cushionsâ the shoe strings had to
be tied. That's the story of the game
that Oakland won â 6 to 3.
â¢ ' it looked pretty bad for Oakland
--hen the seventh opened. It was then
' the shoe string act was seen. Dr. Mos
l kitnan had planted one safely out lo
light field, and Mr. Ganley had doubled
; to" .the score board. Buck Francks
lieppod one out near Bernard and Flood
ijrid ft dropped safely between them.
Of cour?e, the Doc came in while this
*\as going on. Ganley also rounded
'â¢third and wag tearing for the plate.
.Bfrnard .threw the ball to H. Spies and
i.t pot away from him. At this uncom
. Yf.rtarble and inopportune moment
Henry's shoe string began to bother
' h'rm. . He stooged down to tie it and
â¢ aUowed the ball to lay carelessly near
â¢by. -
Mr. Franekj* had no respect for Hen
ry's _ shoe strings. He rudely tore
a.rouad those bases, nor did he stop
V>"heh he saw Henry's Fhoe strings be
.< dme all tangled up. He ran right for
â¢tiet plate, and just as Henry finished
tÂ«fr.g his shoe string Mr. Franck*
f [antf-d his foot on the pan.
. " That made the score 4 to 2 in favor
â¢<f the Oak*, and it was good enough
to win. True.. Cravath knocked out a
â¢ homer over the right field fence in the
â¢ Jphrh, but Oakland made three hits
.. rha two runs in their half of the round.
DV.' Moskiman had them buffaloed in
every, round but the third. It was then
he walked Spies. Wheeler ar.d Flood in
a row, and two of them chased them
1 reives homeward on Jud Smith's
". skimpy hit to right.
Â¦ : \Vhc-n Buck Francks completed his
gTeat run all around the bags the fans
TeW Â¦ sood-r.ature<3 to the money point.
They be^an to shower the coin at the
â¢ 'agile Uui-k. Devereaux then began to
H* showed 'era how he used to
'ptt the coin when he had a monkey
.and a'n organ on his staff over in Osh
!f*h, and neatly gathered in all the
pÂ£Â£oft that came raining on the ground,

drew a ' big crowd to-day to Worth

20 to 1 down to 8 to 1, rolled home.

MORRIS PARK, N. Y., May 13.â Not
often do two horses from one racing
stable win in one afternoon .at long
odds as was the case to-day/when the
National Stable's entries. Belle Strome
and Invader, won the fourth and fifth
races, respectively, each ; starring* at
liberal odds.
Belle Strome won the fourth race
with such ridiculous ease that she
should be a "dangerous candidate for
the Stallion Stakes, in which she will
meet Song and Wine, Matha. Gorman,
Tanya and, perha'ps, some as yet un
discovered Â¦â¢- twa-yearold .. champions.
She is a full sister to Eugenia Burch.
which Is. owned by Mrs. J-..;A.: Curtis.
The Notional Stable is said ; to' be
owned by a 'woman. Miss rf." â¢*â¢ Smith,
business partner of A. H. .Larqar, a
Wall street operator. .
Eugenia Burch cost her owner $275,
and has won many times that amount.
Belle Strome. her full sister, cost $5700
as a' yearling. In a few of the books
the odds against Belle Strome were
100 to 1, but 50 to 1 was the ruling
quotation in the opening betting and
SO to 1 was quoted at post time. .No
great amount of money could have
been won on the filly. Her time, 53
seconds for four and a half furlongs,
is a second and a half slower than was
Tanya's performance on the preced
ing day. Summary:
FIRSTâ RACEâ Six and a half furlongs;
purse; for three .year-old* 'and up. â¢

PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readlcsa are like
a living page of Flammarion's treatise that Is
so electrifying the world to-day. He Is no
imitator. His work is upon original lines,
pure thought, clear vision. He tells you what
you desire to know and works in the open
llfiht.
He Is as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he is for his original ex-
5 preaslon and vivid' truthfulness.
Â¦ A test reading la not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test
la of little value; when the mind Is troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.
This is Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE
gives you when you call on him for a first-
class clairvoyant rcadlns.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts in your case. Let PROF. LIV-
INGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.

yesterday to abolish the teaching of
the vertical system of handwriting
now In use in ths public school de

modifications, which will be adopted

is to obtain rapidity as well as legi
bility in the writing of pupils. Let
ters have been received from many
banks and business houses advocating
a change in the system taught in the

CHICAGO. May 13.â Lower cables and
heaviness of Argentine shipments caused
heavy selling rreseure in wheat at the optn
ing to-day. Initial sales were made at slight
ly lower Drlces, July being down a shade to
VJ(Â§%c at- 84 Vic. to 84%c. Weather in the
Northwest, was wet and cold, and. this fact
brought out some buying orders early In the
day, resulting in a little firmer feeling. But
while seeding opt rations ,in the Red River
Valley were being delayed by ralna, the winter
wheat sections of the country were being
greatly benefited by the additional moisture.
In consequence, the majority of traders weri
inclined to take the selling side of the mar
ket. The weekly report of two different crop
statis'tlcla'ns showed Improved- prospects in all
sections of the wheat belt* where any benefit
was possible. Liquidation was heavy late in
the day and the market failed to recover any
of the previous* lofis, thf close being at the
bottom for the session. July closed at 83%c.
A3 a res-Jit of bearish crou reports and of
the slump in wheat', the corn market was sub
jected to a general sMline movement dur
ing the latter part of the session. The close
was at the low point, with July a cent lower
at 47%c. . .
Oats were 'affected by the weakness of
wheat and corn. July closed at 3S\4câ %c
lower.
Under the influence of a weak grain market,
provisions ruled easier with the exceDtion of
rite, which were relatively firmer on buy
ing cr:tiiteil to a biÂ«t packer. Outsiders sold
pork and lard freely and there was very lit
tle supuort aside from Â«ome early btiyinr by
brokers. July pork cloeed down 7V4cÂ®10c at
$11 lCflll 17U- Lard was oft 7Hc au $0 37V4.
Ribs were a shade lower at $6 3590 37^.

rather brisk, but prices of Berries and De-

There were Increased receipts of Apricots from

The committee asked the City At
torney to advise It if it is necessary to
obtain a complete abstract of title to
Franklin Square,- In view of the two
bids for $395 and $300 to furnish the
abstract, the cost being regarded as
too heavy.
' The committee recommended the
granting of the petition of Charles and
Henry Bush that the action instituted
by the city for the removal of a cer
tain Btaircase encroaching on the side
walk on the northeast corner of Eddy
<ind Franklin streets be dismissed.
The committee ascertained that the
Board of Supervisors had granted a
permit to the Bush brothers In 1W0
for the construction of the steps for a
distance of eighteen inches on the side
walk.
The joint Supervisors' Committee on
Judiciary and Police yesterday recom
mended the indefinite postponement of
the proposed ordinance prohibiting ob
structions by meetings, crowds or per
sons, of the free passage of public
streets and sidewalks â¢within a certain
prescribed district, except by special
permit of the Board of Public Works.
The ordinance was introduced at th*
request of the Police Department,
which desired to put an end to the
gatherings on Grant avenue, against
which the merchants of the thorough
fare vigorously objected. Many pro
tests against the ordinance were filed
by labor unions and the Salvation
Army, which, claimed that t the or
dinance would put a stop to their
frtreet services.

Board of Regents met in the Mark
Hopkins Art Institute and fixed the
budget for 1904-05.
The total income upon which the Re
gents will have to work is placed ' at

for contingencies. That amount does
not include $100,000 appropriated by the
State for the completion of California
Hall, nor the $25,000 endowment of the
Wilmerding School or the $7000 from
special endowments. '
Many . increases of salaries were
agreed upon, and the fortunate tutors
are as follows: 11

Colonel Thomas H. Handbury, U. S.
Engineers, who has been sick at the
General Hospital for the past month,
is so far,- recovered that he expects to
be abl*Â» to return to his home during
the coming week.
Captain George W.*. Read, Ninth
Cavalry, from Ord Barracks, registered

Court-martial or no court-martial.
Colonel Pitcher has the satisfaction of
knowing that the old and tried' veter
ans of the Civil War and the graduates
of West Point stand by him to a man
in the present position that has been
forced upon him.
Major William E. Birkhimer will be
operated upon this morning at the
General Hospital. He has been laid
up; for several weeks and hoped to es
cape without the operation. Yesterday,
however, the surgeons in charge de
cided that there was no other step to
take.
He said he had never seen him drunk.
The night that Aiken ran away from
his quarters Mrs. Aiken had come to
the witness for aid in restraining the
defendant. The witness had responded
to Mrs. Aiken's request, but the de
fendant had disappeared. When Aiken
returned he appeared to the witness to
be in a state bordering on dementia.
The colored boy who served meals
to Lieutenant Aiken also testified to
the effect that Aiken's actions were
peculiar. - >
Other witnesses were Colonel Charles
H. Noble, Tenth Infantry, the com
mandant of the cantonment, who
simply testified in regard to the com
mands issued to the defendant, and Dr.
Edmund D. Shortlidge, who was called
as an expert witness on insanity.
â¢ At 12:20 the case closed, all the testi
mony being in. The court will convene
again on Tuesday at 10 a. m., when
the findings will be decided upon.
The affairs of Colonel Pitcher still
continue to agitate the post. On all
sides his brother officers speak in the
highest terms of him as a soldier and
a gentleman. The action taken by the
friends of Miss Caroline Harold in
Washington is commented upon in
terms far from complimentary.
BROTHER OFFICERS LOYAL.
The trial of Lieutenant W. B. Aiken
Â¦was resumed yesterday morning at the
Presidio. The testimony offered was
entirely for the defense and was all on
lines going to show that the defendant
was irresponsible at the time he com
mitted the breach of arrest for which
he Is being tried. The chief witness in
his behalf was Lieutenant Edward A.
Kreger. Twenty-eighth Infantry.
Kreger stated that he thought Lieu
tenant Aiken at the time he made the
alleged breach of arrest was in reality
not responsible for his actions. He had
seen him before the acÂ£ was committed
and afterward, and he thought that
Aiken was mentally affected. He had
never seen Aiken take a drink, but he
had seen him after he had been on a
spree, and he certainly thought that at
those times he was not in a responsible
condition. He had heard that it only
took a very few drinks to affect him.
He had also heard reports that Aiken
when in a fit of despondency had
threatened to commit suicide. AH this
was supposed to have been superin
duced by drink.
NEVER SAW HIM DRUNK.
At 3:30 o'clock In the afternoon As
eitant United States Attorney Ben I*
McKInley closed the case for the Gov
ernment by reading a batch of letters
.and circulars which had been sent
through the mails by Rumble to peo
ple in the East. Nuggets, 2 per cent
dividends and spiritualism were the
prevailing topics.
The star lady witness of the day
xras Mrs. Medora Fritz, formerly a
beauty doctor. Mrs. Fritz is a trim,
veil preserved little woman on the
pics or minus side of 50. She said
she had become acquainted with Rum
ble in New Tork City in 1871.

the witness -hat in pursuance of an
agreement between herself and
Humble she had in the Superior Court
of Santa. Clara County recovered a
judgment by default against the Sun
sat Mining Company for $12,000
* miners' wages, alleged to have been
unpaid by Rumble. But Lawyer Hart
objected and the court ruled that al
though Rumble might have practiced
innumerable frauds against the stock
holders, the Santa Clara matter had
nothing whatever to do with this
case. The smiling Medora thereupon
left the witness stand and resumed her
seat alongside of Rumble's six-foot
stenographer. f
H.. D. Gutchens, a broker, with -of
fices at the corner of Broadway and
Nassau street. New Tork, testified that
lie sold 15,000 shares of mining stock
for Rumble at $1 50 a shafe and
pocketed 57500 as his commission. He
visited the Old Glory mine In April,
1902, and remonstrated with Rumble
Â¦ for keeping the stock ledger and stock
Â¦book â his only books of account â in
lead pencil. Rumble replied that lead
pencil had been always used in kâ¬ep
lng his accounts and that it was "all
right"
Gutchens admitted that he sojld
about 10.000 of the 15,000 shares after
â¢ his investigation of the mine.
Proceedings in the United States
District Court yesterday* in the trial
of George W. Rumble, indicted for us
ing the mails in furtherance of a
fraudulent mining scheme, were
lirought to an abrupt termination by
W. H. Hart, who announced that he
liad just received a message that his
favorite nephew, Mr. Miner, was dying.
The trial thereupon went over until
Monday. Mr. Hart was visibly af
fected.
Justice of the Peace Golden yester
day gave Judgment in favor of Police
Sergeant J. B. Cook and Policeman D.
Russell, who were sued by Ltrn Sing
& Co. for the recovery of eleven cases
of blank lottery tickets. Golden held
that the possession of the tickets was
in violation of the existing ordinance,
making it unlawful to have devices-,
used or intended to be used for lottery*
purposes. The police seized the tickets
under a search warrant.

they had seen anything or his brother- |
in-law, as he did not come home dur- â¢
ing the night and might have met
with foul play. Further along In the
conversation Soeder said that Blaise
might have gone out to the Mission, j
where he had some friends and might !
have spent the night with them. . j
He left the house shortly afterward
and did not return until noon. Then
he was informed by Nieblas that Blaise
had been murdered. "Get out," said
Soeder, incredulously. Nieblas assur
ed him that" the statement' was true ]
and then Soeder started for the front Â¦
door, exclaiming "My God!" Mrs.
Nieblas followed him and adviBed him
to go to the Hall of Justice at once,
as a detective had visited the house
and requested his presence there. Dur
ing the conversation Nieblas. asked
Soeder if he knew the spot -on' Rus
sian Hill .where his brqther-i -.-law's ;
body had been found and he said that
he had passed; it many times. Mrs.
Nieblas testified that Soeder was al
ways well behaved while he lodged in
her house. . , T â â¢ -â¢
Dr. Bothe, City Chemist, to ' whom
Blalse's'stomach was submitted by Dr.
Bacigalupi after. the autopsy, was call
ed to the, stand, but/before he gave
any testimony Judge Cootf decided-, to
adjourn. The chemist will be the first
witness when the hearing is resumed
at 11 o'clock Monday morning. ,
Nieblas was followed by his wife at j
the afternoon sessloru She told prac- j
tlcally the same story as her. husband ;
regarding the Action of her two lodgers, j
She said that on the morning of Janu- 1
ary 11, at 6:30 o'clock, she was awak- j
ened by Soeder rapping on the door !
of the bedroom occupied by herself!
and husband. Soeder asked them If j
About the only material facts he tes
tified to regarded the finding in ' Soe
der's'room of a revolver and a bottle
which he said .contained chloroform.
Testifying in rebuttal to Soeder's claim
that he was in the room at 9:30 o'cloclc
on the night of January 10,* when
Blaise was killed, Nieblas admitted
that he and his wife were in the rear
of the house until 10 o'clock of that |
night and that Soeder might have en- 1
tered and gone to bed . without their i
hearing him. He claimed . to have '
found footprints onsthe outside "of the.j
window In the room occupied by Soe- |
der and Blaise and when he fitted a !
pair of- Soeder's shoes: in the tracks !
they exactly, complied , with the marks.!
MRS. NIEBLiAS TESTIFIES. ;
Joseph Nieblas. proprietor of the
house at 827 Jackson street where Soe
der and Blaise lived for two weeks
prior to the murder, was next called
to the stand. He testified volubly^
Evidently he got on Judge Cook's
nerves, but a fear of prejudice against
the witness directed the court's ruffled
feeling to General Salomon. Three
times during the session the
Judge reprimanded. the leading coun
sel for the defense for directing the
witness in his answers. ', " _
LANDLORD OX STAND.
Dr. Baclgalupi, autopsy surgeon -of
the Coroner's office, was the first wit
ness called in the morning session. He
testified to the fact that the death of
Blaise resulted from a stab wound in
the throat that severed the carotid ar
tery on the right side and that loss of
blood resulted in death. He^said that
the wound In the throat was defined
and incisive and'must have been made
by an extremely sharp instrument.
The wounds on the head, he said,
might have been- caused by a blow,' a
fall or a kick. Otherwise he found no
evidences that might lead him to be
lieve , that Blaise had
tumbled from the top of the retaining
wall 'en Taylor street. There were no
marks on the body to indicate a fall
other than the wounds on the head.
The prosecution" in the trial of Leon
Soeder- for ? the murder of his brother
in-law, Joseph Blaise, now proceeding
before Superior Judge Cook, started
yesterday to. complete its evidence re
garding the corpus delicti. Blaise was
found dead below a retaining wall on
Taylor street, Vallejo and
Green streets, on the morning of Janu
ary 11, of this year. At 7 o'clock on
the evening of the same date Soeder
was arrested for the* crime. , With in
terruptions his" trial has- been in pro
gress since - May; 11. \ ' - ' '
The"*new'plan 'provides for an increase
of $3 monthly in .the salaried of pri
mary principals,- beginning with thoss
having charge of one class, whose sal
ary is $105 per month. The salary of
principals of schools, having two
classes is placed at $103; three classes,
Jill; four, classes, $114; five classes,
5117; six classes, $120; seven classes.
$123; eight classes/ $126; nine classes,
$129; ten classes,' $132; eleven classes,
$135; twelve classes, $138; thirteen
classes, $141; fourteen classes, $144; fif
teen classes, $147; sixteen classes, $150;
seventeen classes, $153; eighteen

Under the present schedule principals
of schools having two and| , three
classes receive $105 per month; of four,
five, six, seven, eight and nine
classes; $120; of ten, eleven, twelve and
thirteen classes, $130; of fourteen,-fif
teen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen and
nineteen classes, $150. - -
Under Woodward's arrangement,
should it be adopted by. the Board of
Education, some salaries will be raised
and others " decreased.' . . I Woodward
claims. that his plan is more just, be
cause it provides for an. Increase for
each additional. class. He calls atten
tion to the fact that a principal of
thirteen . classes receives $130 per
month, and a principal with one class
more receives $150, an increase that
Woodward considers disproportionate
with the amount of Â¦ added responsi
bility. . ;,
Commissioner of- Public Works
Vv r oodward is preparing a plan for the
equalization of the salaries o^prlncir
pals of the primary schools which he
will shortly submit to the Board of Ed
ucation for consideration. The plan
was formulated by ."Woodward , at the
time he was president- of. the. Board
of Education,, but his transfer to a
commisslohership interfered with t his
intention to submit it to his colleagues
