painful headache; my'lieaft was beat
ing faster than usual and < I "was very
nervous. The morning was particular

sunshine streamed , into my room. I
dressed myself carefully with trem

clothes, though all the while something
was twinging at my heart. "Supersti

tried to think of Katia. but this

opened a volume of Pushkin, glanced
at some of his most passionate stan

cold and lifeless to me. I tried to. read
my favorite pc-et, Heine, but none of

cannot think at all. Our thoughts
The weeks tl.at followed my be

was with Katia a great deal of each
day. -which Is the best description" I
can give of how blissful this period
was. I believe that a lover, like a poet,
is born not made, and I think I .was
born a lover. A few months passed
by, during which I came in contact
with nobody but my beloved Katia. I
gave up my lodgings in the* Jewish
quarter LIbedski, in order, that my
connections with the Jewish people
might be cut off entirely; and I did not
inform any of my friends of my be

about two months ago (two months,
did he say?), on May 13 (my mind be-
â¢*Where am I?" were the first word*
I uttered when I opened my eyes after
the events described In the last.chap
ter. .Â¦'-'Â¦:'* 'â¢ â¢ \i Â¦'Â¦/Â¦'
A young lady who stood at the, other
end of the room came quickly up to
me and murmured: "H* Is gaining
consciousness." Her face seemed fa
miliar, yet I could'not recall her.- :
"Where am I?" I repeated.
"Be at ease, Mr. Russakoff. You are
among friends." '
I looked around. The room was not
mine. My' bookcase and desk were
missing, and there were three windows
here, while mine had only two. On a
small table near the bed on which I*
lay stood little flasks of medldne. I
must have been sick I thought.
I tried to collect my -thoughts; but
my memory was absolutely blank. 2
looked now at the woman, now at the
drugs, but soon I felt a pain In nay
head and became . half -unconscious.
Flying stones, babes hurled in the air,
a sweet-faced young girl In a blue
dress with a golden crucifix dangling
over her bosom, fire, smoke, bloodâ a
lot of bloodâ a bis pool in which I
swam up to my neckâ and all was"
blank again.
The next time I opened my eyes I
found Mr. Levlnski and his wifeâ I
now recognized the young, woman I
had seen beforeâ seated ;at my side
She was standing with, a small flask
and a teaspoon in her hand.
"How do you feel, Mr. Russakoff?"
Levlnski asked.
"I feel no pain." I answered. "What
happened to me? Tell me. please "
"I'll tell you when yon get a little
stronger.- The physician forbade us to
disturb you in the least." .
His wife gave me a spoonful of tht
liquid from the flask. I lay there for
some time, gazing at the ceiling.- and
trying to recall what had occurred be
for I fell sick.
A REACTION.
CHAPTER XIL'
I shivered at his touch. The peculiar,
incidents of my dream appeared before
me. Something within me wanted to
throw his hand from my shoulder and
cry out "Murderer!" But I controlled
myself and stood quietly with my eyes
down while he wished us all happiness.
She met me in the hall, finger on
lips. "S-h! Papa is waiting in the re
ception-room," she whispered. "I told
him of our engagement, but I did not
tell him who you were. At first he was
surprised, but I soon . brought him
around to my way of thinking. He
said he would have to give us his
blessing, since I loved you so much."
She clasped my arm tightly, and so we
went into the reception room.
Judge Bialnick did not look particu
larly pleased, but nevertheless' he re
ceived me almost cordially.
"Since Katia has chosen you it must
be for the best," he said, placing one
of his trembling hands upon my shoul
der. "I know my Katia would choose
only the right one."
He drew her within his other arm
and kissed her.
I tried to remember what had hap
pened to me the night before, but all
that I remember was that I began to
undress myself. I thought of Katia
and of my obligation to meet her this
morning, but the memory of my dream
chilled- my brain. However, j my rea
son predominated, and I, said to my
self as I prepared to go to my beloved,
"Traume sinrt Schaume," and tried to
banish the vision from my mind. . I
paced- the room with the tower In my
hands, wiping my face and laughing at
my own superstition. "Dreams are the
fruit of idle brains," I murmured; yet
the one I had just experienced contin
ued to annoy me, and my heart beat
like a sledge-hammer. Finally I con
quered my superstition and set out to
visit Katia.
I opened my eyes. I found my land
lady standing at the foot of the bed, a
trifle frightened.
"Mr. Russakoff," she explained, "I
wondered what could have happened
to you. Ten o'clock and you were not
up yet. I sent up my little girl and she
said ths door was unlocked and you
were asleep in your clothes. You have
looked a little melancholy of late, and
I thought God knows what has hap
pened to you. You must have had
bad dreams, for you were crying in
your sleep when I came In. But crying
in sleep is a sign of joy."
man-ghost relaxed his clasped hands
and motioned to the right. I looked.
The myriads of candles were suddenly
extinguished and palpable darkness
pervaded the very atmosphere of the
church. Suddenly, as from the mouth
of a volcano, a streak or flame leaped
from the ground, which had been oc
cupied by the audience. By its light I
noticed before me priests in robes
like clergymen with big crucifixes in
their hands groping about in darkness.
They all came forward to the flame
and threw fagots from a pile that lay
close by. The flame turned into a big
blaze. The priests lifted their voices
and chanted religious hymns above the
noisy crackling. Their song was me
lodious, devotional, sad. Groans
reached my ears; I turned. An old
man with long, silvery beard and hair
and a beautiful maiden with arms
clinging around his neck were brought,
before the fire. The maiden's "massive
luxuriant black hair mingled with the
old man's white beard, and their tears
streamed down together. They lifted
their eyes heavenward, and the blaze
lighted up their contrasting counte
nances â his marred by old age 'and sor
row, hers blooming ana sweet. The
patriarch uttered in a weird voice,
that echoed far and wide: "Hear, O
Israel! God our Lord, God is one."
Then he exchanged kisses with the
maiden by his side, and their, tears
flowed In one stream. "Yahweh is one,"
both repeated.
A murmur of surprise passed from
priest to priest. Then again every
thing was hushed. Solemnly the aged
man and the maiden were led to the
rising- flames. The fagots crackled
louder and louder, the flames rose
higher and higher, the priests sang and
chanted with more devotion, and a
weird voice answered: "Yahweh is
one."
Suddenly the spectators were hushed
fk it by me sic, and two apparitions el
bowed their way to where the priest
and I stood. I shrank back with fright
n3 the ghosts advanced a step and put
themselves between me and the font.
One was shrouded and wrapped in a
Talis. and had his hands and long
bony arms clasped over his head as if
in despair. The other was the ghost of
a woman,- â¢ tall and lean, hollow
cheeked, with hair disheveled, and
wild eyes that seemed about lo"dart
from their cavernous' sockets. The
priest checked himself.
The apparitions came close to me;
their shrouds touched my clothes; I
shuddered. They both fixed upon me
more horror than words could tell. The
It seemed to me I stood before the
altar, above which VarnltzofTs "Ma
donna and Child" shone with unusual
brilliancy, and a priest in his clerical
r'arb stood by the baptismal font and
held a bronze crucifix in his hand.
The bells continued to chime while a
great crowd of people were filling the
immense church. Yet everything about
roc {was so Quiet that I could almost
hear the movements of the priest's lips
as hr> solemnly rolled his eyes and
murmured spme prayer. He opened a
Email hymn-book and read something
from it. lly eye? were fixed upon the
"Madonna and Child" in front of me,
half in admiration, half in bewilder
ment.
The gorgeous Vladimir Cathedral,
one of the hc-tiest of the "holy quar
ter" of Kieff. was brilliantly illumi
nated by myriads of tapers. The high
arched ceilings looked like a frosty
winter sky with innumerable twinkling
stars. Hundreds of bells tolled sonor
ously, clamorously, and their resound
ing echo made the earth tremble. How
l*ud they rang arid clanged! The high
portals cf- the cathedral were open and
people â thousands of themâ were com
ing.in with bowed heads and solemn
faces. "A Jew Ic going to be baptized,"
I heard rcme one whisper.
I moved a chair near the grate, and
resttxit my feet pn the fender I fixed
my eyes on the glowing spots within.
Listlessly I looked at the little tongues
of flames shooting forth here and
there a-r.d battling for life "among the
â¢dead reals and spiritleFS ashes. I was
xjwn engrossed in this play of life and
death, when suddenly a coal crackled
with a short crisp snap, like that of
agony, and rolling' aside sent forth
l'.ery line'?, which soon formed the out
lines cf a human face. Against the
bliick coalr, which were piled up like
a braided .skein of hair, glittered two
bright spots like sparkling eyes; there
below the flames curved in the shape
of .lips slightly opened; and lower still
two red coals intersected to form a
golden crucifix. The arms of the cruci
fix increased in length; then the face
vanished; . In another instant, at the
point of the arms of the cross I be
held a face without a body or hands or
feet. Theii-the arms of the human
lorra extgeded along the arms of the
cross, legs along the foot of it, a bodyâ
and lot. the cross vanished and I be
held my own Image.
tl remember that I gazed stupidly at
this', fire-drawn picture for a long while,
when another spectacle appeared be
fore me. â¢ â¢
â¢ Coming "'into.' my room, I lighted my
limp and put a few coals, upon the
fire, which had all but expired. The
lamplight was tea intense, I thought,
and I turned down the wick, leaving
a scarcely visible glow. One thinks
best in darkness. , .Â¦'..":' Â¦;
\Valking home that afternoon
through the. Krestchatikâ the main
thoroughfare â which was teeming with
"busy pedestrians, my senses were
stunned. All I could hear was a deaf
ening clamor of bells. Swiftly I trav
ersed the Igng, beautiful streets as If
impelled by a cyclone. Now and then
I raised my eyes to a monument, a
i hurch, a cathedral and instinctively
frowned. My brain seemed to have be
come" suddenly benumbed. At the
junction of Podol with Pecherslcoi I
stopped involuntarily and stared like
an idiot: at St. Vladimir's monument,
whkh'.is supposed to mark -the site of
a. fountain at which his children were
baptized. The high-stuccoed obelisk
filled. me with a. mysterious supersti
tious- :â¢. we, and as' my eyes rested on
.the. wot'den crucifix I murmured to my
self the -inscription which it bears in
Hebrew, Creek and Latin: "Jesus of

"Ho! ho! ho! ho!" cheered hundreds
from the crowd below. "Throw down
the Jewish brat!" '
With the exultation of conquest the
screeching babe was flung high in the
air like a ball, and It came down upon,
the pavement with a splash of blood
that bespattered the bystanders.

crowd so closely together that we can
not fully grasp a single one. -
I - waited i distractedly for the speci
fied hour. I drew my watch from my
pocket, laid it on the table .and looked
at its face. How slow its hands crept!
I wound It up every quarter of an
hour, and wondered, how long fifteen
minutes was and 'how long a man's
life was. .
A clock in the neighborhood struck
two; the appointed hourâ the hour to
wash off my Judaism with a little
Christian wateÂ£-had arrived. I locked
the door of my* room, put the key into
my pocket with a nervous hand, and
walked slowly toward the priest's
house.
I had to pass . the Jewish settlement
Ubedskl. This caused me some un
easiness. I was ashamed of myself
and wished I could avoid it, but there
was no other way.
An uproar broke upon my ears as I
approached Llbedski â the wild, boister
ous noise of muzhiks' in a skirmish. But
In the Jewish quarter on Sunday! I
wondered, and a sudden fear possessed
me. People were running from all
sides, and forgetting everything else I
ran after them. I soon found myself
In the midst of a turbulent mob. Jos
tled and carried along like a wisp of
straw on a flowing stream. The street
was filled with gesticulating, brawling
peasants, who gave vent to volleys of
oaths as only descendants of Tartars
know how, and rapaciously attacked
Jewish shops and dwellings. Here and
there savage, looking muzhiks,, with
long, unkempt, sandy hair, bloodshot
eyes and disordered dress, shouted and
yelled through the windows of wrecked
houses like firemen fighting flames.
The noises wore deafening: the crash
of axes mingled . with wild shrieks of
victory; the ring of crowbars echoed
above cries of agony; the clanking of
hatchets drowned piercing screams of
butchered babes; whoops of triumph
swallowed heartrending groans of de
spair.
"Take carel" bellowed a rioter from
a second-story window to the j excited
crowd below, as he shoved out a long
mirror, which appeared In the sun like
a sheet of quivering fire. An air-split
ting cheer went up as the glass was
shattered upon the pavement.
"Stand back!" hoarse voices called
form another upper story window as
a piano was forced through. A second
later it struck the sidewalk with a, re
sounding crash. . ? rj
"Catch it! Catch ' It!" a roaring
voice came from a third story, as a
screaming babe was swung in the air
by its feet. ,
With a jubilant shout the struggling
old man was raised in the air and car
ried up to- the -high ga41ery. : V.

faintly moaned the victim.'
"The holy Torah â the holy Torah!"
mocked the rioters; and with a. heavy
thud the martyr's body struck the
floor. " â¢ ."u
I remembered the Iron in iny hand.
"Blood! blood! blood!" I muttered to
myself as the- violators began to tear
the scrolls of the Torah in stflpa and
trample the parchment under foot: My
iron rose and fell mercilessly. I cleared
my way until I reached" the door;
Finding myself outside. I continued the
slaughter. But suddenly my Â» eyes
dimmed, I became dizzy, and' a hot
current passed through my body. The
Iron- drooped from my clasp "and J
raised my hand to my forehead! Some
thing like a drop of boiling water
dripped down my nose. I wiped it
away, but it dripped faster and faster.
Tumult, confusion, shrieking, scream
ing, begging. Imploring.
I stopped before .the -synagogue. -A.
gang of brutes were forcing an en
trance into the house of worship. Its
doors were soon stormed and the crowd
burst furiously In. I pressed in after
them. Befcrre the ark that contained
scrolls of the Torah â the book, that In
spired prophets and poets and sages â
stood an .old Jew wrapped in a Tails,
his arms spread across its portals and
begging mercifully:
"Kill me, but save the holy Torah."
- "Take him to the gallery!" the one
who acted as leader commanded.
She was caught and thrown to the
ground struggling for her life, for her
honor.
"Stop!" I cried with' all my. might,
and began to pull away the rioters.
They gave me no heed. .; â¢'
"Christians! men! beasts-rhalt!** I
shouted at the too of my voice. Â¦
"Kill the Jew!" a cry /went op. A
number of bystanders dragged me
from the assailants, raining blows up
on my head. - . " â¢
"Defend your down-trodden people."
a voice seemed to call from within me.
Clubs, sticks, iron bars littered the
ground. I seized a sharp iron and with
all my strength hammered the heads
bent over their victim. Some fell
bleeding to the ground, while -others
were fighting to finish 'their diabolical
deed- I branished the iron right and
left, up and down, furiously. "Blood!"
I muttered, frantic with the scene be
fore me. I craved to see- blood, to
wash myself clean wlth>.b,lood, to sub
merge myself in blood. I struck head*
and breasts and shoulders with the
rage of a demon, and blood gushsd
forth abundantly. /"Baptize your Jew
ish soul with blood," a weird-likÂ«
voice whispered to me. ; And I did
bathe in fresh, hot human blood.

2Every person's life would make an
interesting story if the narrator only
.knew which portions to tell and which
.to omit. In this. truism will be found
my reason for omitting a detailed, ac
count of thfe two years following my
departure- from my native soil. Like a
restless, spirit I wandered from city to
city, from country to country, with no
definite purpose in view, I traveled
through Germany, France, â Switzer
land, Italy, England. I tried hard to
forget the past â root it put of my
memory â but one face remained' ever
vivid before me. I- searched, I in
quired, but I sought in vain for my
heart's desire.
One fine" frosty morning found me on
the deck of a steamer gently . beating
the waves of New -York Bay and slowly
moving toward the land of liberty.
As the steamer approached Castle
Garden the passengers, with bundles in
their hands, anxiously gazed toward
the shore. . The impatience of the crowd
grew every moment. The climax of
their excitement was reached when the
boat was * being moored. Handker
chiefs were waved from, the dock, and
those on deck who recognized friends
among the waiting crowd exchanged
cries . of greeting with â¢ them. Leaning
against -the railing, my head full of
strange thoughts, I -looked Jealously at
my fellow passengers. Everybody
came to acquaintances, friends, rela-
' IN THE LAND OF LIBERTY.
CHAPTER I.
"And strangers shall stand and feed their
flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your
ploughman and your vinedresser." â Isaiah.
BOOK THE THIRD.
, LIBERTY.
I told him who I was.
"Shrolke!" He sprang up with joy.
"lam w glad to se* youâ as my own
child. Shone Zion! They told me that
you went to the gymnasium, and that
The machine stopped abruptly with a
click, and ralsinsr his head inquisitively
he said In a soft tone: "And who are
you from home? Sit down, please." He
wiped the dust from a chair without a
back, remarking: "I can see that you
arÂ£ not one of the common people,"
"I beg your pardon," I began apolo
getically. "Weren't you the teacher of
thfÂ» Talmud Torah at â "
"Are you a tailor from home?" he
answered with a question, unintention
ally- wounding my pride.
. After J had looked at the man for a
mlm te or two something like a flash of
lightning brightened my memory â Get
zel Gorgle! My heart beat faster; the
consciousness of another acquaintance
sent a thrill of delight through my
heart. \ . .
I decided to go up another flight and
see SImachowitch. When I reached
the door of the manufacturer of pants,
overalls, skirts and . children's suits I
could hear no sound within except a
slight click, between that of a sewing
machine and that of a slot-machine.
I entered the room hesitatingly and
remained standing near the door.
There was only one person in the room
â a middle-aged man, bending over a
button-hole machine.
Although I could tell from the ex
pression of the man making button
holes that he was aware of my pres
ence, he did not raise his eyes, but
kept them fixed on the machine. His
beard struck my fancy first; it was of
a quaint color; the sides were almost
red, the lower, part almost dark, his
mustache fairly brown. His eyes were
dim j and watery; his forehead was
high and broad; a skullcap rested
peacefully on his head. This was Sim
achowitch, "the cheapest clothing
manufacturer In America, "whose spe
cialties were button-holes, overalls,
shirts, knee pants, etc.
When. he had finished a button-hole
the machine jerked and stopped, and
the operator raised his head question
ingly.. I repeated what I had said on
the floor below.
I thought I had seen this man before
but I could not place him. The voice
in particular sounded familiar. So I
made another attempt to make him
reveal his identity. .
"Is tailoring a good trade here?"
Although Dovidle â I should say Mr.
Levando, as he was best known here by
his second name â was engaged In shirt
making himself, he said it would break
his heart to see a graduate of gymna
sium and university sewing garments,
so he advised me to look for more gen
teel work. Thereupon Mr. Takiff sug
gested cigar-making, but Malke mur
mured that cigar-making would hurt
my lungs and heart. However, Mon
day morning I decided to take a tour
through the small cigar shops on the
East Side, to look for a job. After an
hour of aimless wandering I stopped
before a number of English-Yiddish
signs, with a determination to seek
work from some of the firms within.
I walked up two flights of stairs and
found myself in a hallway so dark that
I could see no door. Sewing-machines
worked speedily somewhere within and
made the floor tremble. As I stoc.il
wondering where the door could be. it
swung open, and I was almost knocked
over by a boy with sleeves rolled up,
who darted past me and down the
stairs. I entered the door and found
myself in a square room, the dimen
sions of which could not have been
more than sixteen feet. Two girls sat
stooped over sewing-machines, with
their eyes fixed upon the pieces of
cloth that they pushed under the nee
dles.
"Whr-râ whr-r â whr-r-r-r â " the ma
chines hummed busily. At another
machine sat an elderly man with spec
tacles, and one machine stood unoc
cupied, which I surmised belonged to
the boy who had almost caused my
overthrow at the door. There was only
one window: a small gaslight burned
over the elderly man's machine, which
was farthest from the window. A wo
man whese forehead was half-covered
with a wig was pulling the thread
from seams; next to her stood a
presser, whose face was bathed in per
spiration, which he frequently wiped
off with his rolled-up shirt sleeves; and
by his side was a gasoline stove on
which the Irons were heating. .
No. one noticed me as I entered, ex
cept the bewigged woman, who gave
me a furtive glance and dropped her
eyes back to the seam. .
A few minutes later the boy who had
passed me in the hall returned. He
was the boss's son, he informed me,
and, the boss being away, he would at
tend to my wants.
One girl nudged her neighbor with
her elbow, and both cast glances at my
feet. The two of them began to giggle.
The blood ascended to my face; my
feelings were wounded. In my native
land I was respected as a student; here
working-girls laughed at me.
"I can tell a greener by his shoes,"
I overheard one say.
It was only my foreign shoes they
laughed at. However, It hurt me. We
are so egotistic that we even feel the
insults directed at our belongings.
I LOOK FOR A JOB.
CHAPTER III.
"What are you jabbering: there?"
Shmunke appeared In the doorway
with a sneer on his face. "Your Jewish
nonsense over again 7 How many times
have I told you to' leave me out of
your lamentation after your rotten Ju
daism? I'll leave home to-night if you
go on with tnis." He - disappeared
again, and I heard him strike a match
in the next room.
"I have nothing against Shmunlte,"
she whispered to me the next instant;
"if it had not been for us he would not
have come here. ' "What is the use of
talking?. We must keep quiet.' He pays
his board; and I make on him a dollar
or a dollar and a half a week."
Then she walked upon her tiptoes to
Shmunke's room, and opening the door
timidly said:
"Shmuâ aâ Dzames, we have a guest,
a student of Javo-lin â "
Without answering her he appeared
with a lighted, cigarette between his
lips. With his chest thrust forward he
stepped up to me and said in English,
in a tone as if addressing an inferior:
"So you are from Jav'olin. My name is
Dzames Connally. I vas also a r stu
dent of dat place. "
As I was talking with these people,
or rather as Groone talked and we lis
tened, the door opened and a tall, bony
fellow, smooth-shaven, with glasses on
his nose, came in, and without looking
at us passed through the room Into the
next one.
"Shmunke!" Groone called after him.
. "I have told you a million times."
the young man said, turning about,
"that my name Is Dzames, and don't
you call me by your dirty sheeny
names." And he disappeared wrath
fully into the adjoining room.
"That is America for you!" Groone
sodded her head and waved her .hand
toward Shmunke, and Menke puffed at
his pipe indifferently. "'At home*
Rabbi Brill consulted him wheneveV he
had a knotty qoint in the Talmud, and
here he would throw stones at a Jew.
Oi and woe is me what I have lived to
seel"
Menke remained standing as if sud
denly pushed under a shower-bath,
with a half-idiotic smile on his face,
his "American hat" a trifle inclined to
one side. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
"I do remember him, but I can't re
call his name," he stammered in his
nasal voice, shrugging his shoulders.
"Then say you don't know him," his
spouse burst out. "Why are you chew
ing and pretending that you do know
him? Long shall live this head!" She
patted her wig with her hand. "The
moment he opened .the door I cried out
"Israel!"'
Menke was abashed at this; he con
tinued to look at me with a perplexed
and foolish smile.
I said I had neither.
"Upon my word In honor, you're
making fun of me. How is it without
a wife?" she asked incredulously.
With these and like arguments I was
assailed, and would perhaps have sur
rendered had not Menke fortunately
come in.
"S-h!" Groone warned me, then fold
ed her hands in maternal easiness.
"Menke, will you recognize this young
man?" â¢ â¢
"And * your husband's name is
Men 1 -- " I continued tantalizing, hold
ing the door to keep her from shutting
it in, my face.
"What, then, should his name be â
Todres?" came another interrogation,
quick as lightning. Then she added:
"I don't understand you, young man.
My father was just as nice a man as
yours, and don't you come to insult me
In my own house."
"Don't you know me, Groone?" I
smiled, moving a little forward. '
My tone seemed to have gained fa
vor, for she said with, rather less
sharpness: "Where do you come
from?"
I thought this enough dilly-dallying
and told her who I was.
"God be with you! Come In, Reb
Isra-1, come in. Who^ would have ever
believed that you would grow so tall
and nice â and in America! Ach. mein
Gott! You also in America! Tell me,
Reb Israel, how do you come to this
country?" .
"I coul I not come by rail so I came
fly boat," I answered, with rather a
weak attempt at humor.
"I>pon my word, the same Israel,
with the same old jukes. When did
you get here?"
I told her. t
"Did you leave your wife and chil
dren at home?" -
you want?" X
I retreated a step , In surprise. In
stead of announcing myself as her new
lodger, I asked: "If you please, arn't
you from Javolin?"
"Where should I come from If not
from Javolin?" she answered with a
question.
"Is not your name Groone?" I ven
tured to ask again, smiling at the
grimace on her face.
"What, then, is my name â Sprinze?"
she flung another question Instead of a
reply, and swung the door as if to give
me a hint.
Mr. Takiff found me lodgings with a
family that he said he had known in
Russia, and on the following Sunday
morning I climbed the four flights of
dirty stairs that led to my new home
and knocked gently at the door.
It opened, and a heavily bewlgged
woman, with long earrings dangling
down her cheeks, thrust out her head
and asked in Yiddish: "Well, what do
This is my third birth I said to my
self that night as I tossed sleeplessly
from side to side. I was a babe again.

thaK the Ghetto' was foreordained for
me. In vain had I struggled to free

By a force stronger than my will I was
drawn back to It.

CHAPTER II.
A few minutes later Groone and I be
gan to talk business, and after consid
erable bargaining we came to terms â
seventy-five cents' for lodging, and
board to be furnished by her at actual
cost. On the same afternoon my trunk
was placed in Groone's "front room"
and I had become her boarder, siting
in the only rocking-chair in the house
and brooding over my sorry circum
stances.
When I had told him my name he
shook my hand cordially and rattled
off the following speech: "Hov.- rings
turn! Before you vas de intelligence
boy and I vas de fanatic, and yet
(meaning now) you arc, of course, a
good orthodoxian Jewish and I am a
free-t'inker. Dis ignorant Jewish makes
me seock vit deir religion." He spoke
contemptuously, swinging his long arms
and puffing out clouds of cigarette
smoke. "And besides, deir manners are
aw/ul. vit de beards and shabby clo'es,
and dey talk not'ing but Yiddish. Deir
condition is awful! And all because of
deir fanaticism and superstitlousness.
Vere Godâ vat God?â ha! ha! ha! Dey
goes to shool like in Russia and pray
to- whom? Not'ing; dey pray. la dere
a God? Is it not natureâ everyt'lng na
ture, as . Spenoza believed? Dere is
not'ing but nature. And if de Jewish
vould believe in Sotziallsm and read
Karl Marx and Lassalle, or at least
read de Arbelter Zeitung or Dem Ernes,
dey vould too become dellghtened and
educated like us culturised peoples."
' As the train hurried toward the Ger
man frontier I continued to look
through the window, which was fre
quently clouded with a blast of. black
smoke, and I thought of Litwinoff, one
of Turgenieff's creations: "All is but
smoke and -vapor; everything is con
stantly , changing; one shape dissolves
itself into another, one event succeeds
another, but in reality everything re
mains the same. There is much stir
and confusion, but all these clouds
vanish at - last without leaving any
trace, without . having accomplished
anything. The winds cnange their di
rection; they pass to the other side and
there continue their feverish and fruit
less motion."
"Smoke, smokeâ smoke and vapor,"
I muttered to myself. "Smoke, smoke,
and nothing but smoke and vapor." ' .
About a week later the Zion League,
which consisted of a" large, number of
students, young doctors and lawyers,
journalists and engineers, left for Pa
lestine to establish colonies there and
prepare for the coming Messiah.
I, however, decided to try some coun
try of western Europe. I packed up
my belongings, and in the same month
bade farewell to the land that gave me
life and sought to extinguish It. While
I sat in the car that crossed the Rus
sian frontier and looked without, thick
volumes of smoke Issued from the en
gine-stack and rolled over the vast
stretches of stubble-fields and stacks
of reaped rye, wheat, and straw. I
looked gloomily through tne car win
dow as we traversed woods and forests,
flying swiftly across bridges, and al
lowing me only a glimpse of the waters
below and of the broadexpanse of Rus
sian territory. I gazed wistfully at the
varying panorama through which I
sped, and my heart throbbed wildly at
the thought that it might be my last
look at Russia. No matter how cruelly
I had been treated in tnat land it was
the land in which I roamed barefoot in
my childhood, and was ever to be re
membered With yearning.
In a short time I recovered entirely
from my illness; only a scar across my
forehead and right eye was left to re
mind me of my injuries. I was low
spirited most of the time, and stayed
in the 'Jewish settlement. "The stone
which I recently despised became the
headstone of the corner." I felt like
the prodigal son returned to his father.
Again there was a yearning in my
heart for the Ghetto, eurrounded by
high, dingy walls, with a heavy gate;
again there was In my heart a craving
desire for the Beth-Hamedrash, with
its hot ' oven, by which I could sit
among my honest people and brood
over a folio of Talmud. I also had
dreamed, for a certainty. And that
day had awakened me, too.
I BID FAREWELL TO MY FATH
ERLAND.
CHAPTER XIII.
"What has happened to nim?"
"He was arrested immediately after
the riots and â " /
"And was sent to Siberia?" I struck
in fearfully. . . * . _ , .
"No; he managed to escape, and I
was told he is with his daughter either
in France or Switzerland."
self-esteem as a born Jew aroused by
the recent massacre revolted against
my love. I hesitated whether or not
to go back to her.
How strangely people often act!
What would I not have done for
Katia's sake two months before? And
now, when my road was so smooth,
without the least obstacle, I thought
of giving up the loveliest and most
charming girl on account of a little
cold water. True, the world calls it
changing one's faith, but is it not , In
reality only deceiving a narrow
minded priest? True, the world con
demns and despises one who goes
through this ceremony without being
in earnest about it, but do not men in
more ways than this deceive others in
the pursuits of life? Do not writers
every day, in newspapers, magazines
and voluminous books, misrepresent
themselves and express ideas they do
not themselves believe? Do not poli
ticians who are respected and honored
in our community, and whose praises^
are perpetuated in verse â do not these'
political schemers advocate principles
solely for their own benefit? What dif
ference is there between one who mis
represents his ideas or belief for a mil
lion and the poor man 1 - whose stomach
pains from hunger, who lets himself be,
sprinkled with a little cold water by
some priest for a few dollars? Is not
love the most divine and the purest
sentiment that can prompt one to de
ceive a bigoted priest? In doing this
one does not trifle with God, but mere
ly expe-ses a foolish priest -to the ridi
cule of the wise. Never in his life did
the witty Heine play a greater satiri
cal prank on Christendom than by his
baptism.
Finally I decided to go and see Katia.
I inquired of Levinski, who was on
friendly terms with Judge Bialnick,
about the latter.
"Judge Bialnick?" he said. "No one
knows where he is."
He shrugged his shoulders, and the
smile that spread over his face plainly
signified "no."
"Israelâ aâ Russâ " . his brother-in
law tried to help him out. (I had
adopted the second name of my Rus
sian passport.)
He shook his head negatively.
"I had the pleasure of eating at your
table one Friday night," I struck in.
At my ' remark his countenance
beamed with- gratification. "Many ate
at my table at home," he said, nodding
his head with a touch of pride.
I recalled to his mind the occasion on
which I had profited by his hospitality.
A little later I;told them that, much
as I appreciated their kindness I would
not intrude* on them longer, but Would
go at once and look for lodgings.
"Really, ' you â¢ must think we came
from Sodom or Gemoro," said GlUele,
with just a little bit of indignation in
her, voice. "Do you think We. will let
you go away Erev-Shabbos? We are
t'Any news in Russia? How Is the
treatment of the Jews? As severe as
ever?" and added a few more ques
tions without giving me a' chance to
reply to- the first. .
"Do you . recognize him, David?"
(Dovidle being a diminutive of David)
asked Mr. Takiff. :
"It would, be a sin for me to com
plain. I have* to praise the Lord for
His favors to me in my old age. Why
should I bewail my lost wealth so long
as I have saved my daughter? Her
name here is Regina Wlgodski. Yes,
I wrested her from that v 'scoundrel's
hands," he said to me as If he were
talking to himself. "He threatened to
shoot me; he even ' aiiAed at me. But
what a foolish count! I- would -rather
have the bullet pierce, my brain than
leave her in his house. But I saved
her. I found out that she was with him
on his estate near Mohilev. I went
there about a month after you left us.
His servants .would not let me in. But
I got In. He stood In tne veranda of
his palace and set his dogs on me, but
they only tore my. clothes and bruised
my hand here." He showed me a deep
scar. "But I did get into his palace in
spite of all his threats. I implored him
to give me back my daughter, and fell
on my knees before him. I kissed his
boots, only kicked me. He
threatened^to throw me out of his inn
and ruin me. 'Malke, my daughter!' I
cried with all my voice, so she could
not help hearing me. He ordered_hls
servants to throw me out. They beat
me. they flogged me. they almost
crushed me. But I heard somebody
weeping in an adjoining room.' I knew
her voice. I knew ehe would " come
back to me; I was certain that now she
must come. So I waited. I knew she
would come, and come she did.
"It was In the middle of winter. I
had neglected my business and the Inn
was less' frequented, for I was practi
cally alone and could not attend to It.
My wife had died Just a week before."
This last he said as if in answer to my
inquisitive look. "Late one night I was
sitting alone in the house. My little
boy was asleep. Snow had drifted
around the inn as high as the window
sills and a storm was raging. I sat by
the hot oven warming myself and look
ing into a book, though my thoughts
were far away. My wife's ghostâ peace
be with herâ had come to me in a
dream the night before and said: 'No
sen, Malke is coming home;, forgive
her.' I was thinking about this, when
I thought the latch of the door clicked.
It" must be caused by the wind, I de
cided. A, few minutes later the'latch
clicked again,- as if some one were try
ing to lift : it. The blasts. of the^ wind
made frightful noises, tÂ»s if they were
going to upset the inn. Then every
thing was quiet for a minute or so. I
closed my book and paced up and down
the room. I heard something bump
up against the door. I hurried to the
door and opened it. \ A figure lay pros
trate before me. I fetched the lamp
and looked at it. I need not telr you
the rest. She had returned to the God
of Israel." Â¦ .
He heaved a deep sigh and pro
ceeded :
"That scoundrel took the inn away
from me and ruined me, as he had
threatened to do, but I was prepared
for it. I sold out what little was left
me and sailed for America. I left my
son with a wealthy brother gi mine in
Kovno. At home it would be hard for
her to get married, I thought, so I de
cided to come to this country. I- am
not sorry for It.
"Coming over here I had a 4ittle
money yet, and I did not let her go to
work In a shop. I peddled and made
my three or four dollars a week.' But
she insisted on going to work, and she
found a place in a shirt factory, where
she made the acquaintance of Mr. Wi
goski, whom she married a year ago.
He is also a student from home, and he
expects to take a profession after a
while." , \
As he finished tears were rolling
down his wrinkled face, but I could not
tell whether they were tears of joy or
grief. .-..
The door opened and a middle-aged
man with a black beard and a jovial
face entered. I recognized himâ the
same Reb Dovldle I had met six years
before. He was not as well dressed as
he was then, and hard work had made
deep marks in his countenance.
"Well, Gittele, God- be praised!" he
said in Yiddish to his wife. "Business
is improving from day to day." .
â¢ He took off his stiff nat, put on his
skull cap, and came into the "front
room."
, "You are home early to-day, Nosen.
Oh, .1 see, you've found an old friend.
Sholom-alelchem." He 'stretched out
his hand to me cordially. "I can al
ways tell a 'greener' as soon as I look
at him," heÂ«added, without waiting for
a formal Introduction.
"Let us go to 'the front room," said
Mr. Takiff after I had finished eating.
"We will talk over old stories until
'she' comes.".. . '-.
We went to the parlor, or front room,
us they called it. Besices a folding
bed there were a- set of second-hand
plush-covered furniture, a small case
crammed with books, and an old organ.
We sat down, a short pause ensued.
I could see that he wisned to tell me
about Malke, so I waited for him to
begin. â¢
"She will be so glad to see you," he
repeated again. "My Bister grumbles
all the time, but I bear my wounds si
lently." He was approaching the sub
ject gently, I observed. His careworn
face showed inner grief.
proper coals in this country, and who
has the ' time to bother with it? My
husband advised me not to bring it
here at all, bat I could not part with
it; we had three; and, I sold the others.
I also brought a Shaas (the Talmud),
but .who gives a glance into the Tal
mud in this treif America? There it
lies packed up over my bed. At home
my. children would be rabbis, perhaps,
but here-^oi and woe, is me! â no- one
cares for such things. My children do
not want to answer in Yiddish when I
talk to themâ nothing but English. <-'
Finally we reached tÂ»e fourth floor. <
The gray-headed Mr. Tgaklff burst out:
"Let the devil take the American
stairs! They take my breath away." He
tried to open one of the several doors
in the dark hall. It was locked. "She
must have gone out. We'll go into my
slater's until she gets back." .
He knocked at the other door on the
same floor. "Gittele, we have a guest.
Can you recognize him?" he said to the
woman who responded to his knock.
I recognized her instantly. She was
the same Gittele I had seen> years be
fore, buxom and healthy, t>ut her face
bore the marks of suffering. .
She looked at me and smiled, saying
she could not recall me. When my
host told her who I was she seemed de
lighted at seeing me again.
"Are you long from home (meaning
Russia)?"
I told her how long. ,
"Blessed are those who know not of
this cursed land!" she*said with a sigh.
"At home we were somebody. Every
one knew of us and (she always
spoke for/ her husband, too) lived in
comfort; but here â would that .Colum

had been. spared from coming to this
land t)f rigorous service!. Woe to Reb
Dovidle, at whose table every needy
person found food and assistance-! v 1 '
In the meantime I cast a glance
about the house. There 'â¢ were only
three . rooms. The one v.-e sat in was
the kitchen and dining-room, the fur
niture of- which consisted of. a small
table covered _ with oilcloth,, a stove
near the sink, dish shelves on which. I
noticed a samovar and six candle
sticks; on the- walls were a picture of
the President of the United States at
an inauguration, and' certificates of
several lodges, to which, I presumed,
the head of the family belonged. .The
room, though small, was neat and tidy.'
"Make yourself at home, Mr.' Russa
koff," Gittele said to me,., returning
with a white cloth; which she laid on
the table. * *'My brother's guest is also
my gue^t; and . besides, we : are .old
friends, too."
She poured out tea for me, remark
ing: "American teu! Does it have any
taste or flavor? I brought a samovar
from home, but where can you get the

"Let " the whole business go to
blazes!" he answered bitterly. "I stay
here all day and make thirty or forty
cents, and sometimes I must give away
half of my profit to that tall policeman,
who often threatens to make me move.
This is American business," he added
with a sigh.
"How delighted I am to see you, my
good Israel!" he said with manifest,
pleasure, as we pressed through the
busy crowd. "You will excuse me for
calling you Israel; in America you will
be Mister," he explained ironically.
"Oh/ she will be so pleased to see you!"
he repeated without mentioning \ her
name. "We are not far from Â«my
home; we live on- Ludloff- (Ludlow)
street."
"Here we are.", he said a few minutes
later, stopping 'before a dingy, five
story tenement house. "We 'live high
up^-on the fourth." Â¦ . â¢ â¢
He quickly thrust h|s merchandise
into his box and paid: "Come to my
house. She will be glad to see you."
I divined who "she" was.
"Do not trouble yourself on my* ac
count. I do not want you to lose to
day's profit," I urged.
I told him.
Then I heard a voice that made me
turn around and stare. "Women!
women! candles for shabbos! Six for
five cents â for shabbos!"
The candle-vender was a tall man
with a white beard, dressed in a
threadbare coat that had once been of
good quality, and a costly Russian fur
hat that betrayed long wear. From his
shoulder hung a box oy a strap.
"Women! candles for shabbos! Six for.
five cents â for shabbos!" he repeated
automatically.
I observed him closely. "Is it possi
bleâMr. Takiff?" I asked myself in
credulously.
He seemed to feel scrutiny and raised
his eyes. His face was marred by deep
furrows of sorrow, and his eyes looked
melancholy: . Â¦*
"Mr. Takiff?" I said.
He looked at me studiously. "Israel?"
he answered hesitatingly.
I nodded my head: I was over
whelmed with emotion. * . *
"Mr. Takiff?" I repeated. .
Call me not Naomi, call, me Mara;
for the Almighty has dealt very bitter
ly with me," he answered in the words
of Naomi, shaking my ,hand affection
ately. . . ?
\"How" long have youtbeeh here?".: he
questioned. 'â¢"* .
.1 wandered about aimlessly for an
hour or more, and finally I reached the
corner of Hester and. Ludlow streets.
The scene made me pause.
There were thousands of people, and
everybody was selling something/ -The
sidewalks, or the planks that served as
sidewalks, were decayed; there might
have been a pavement years ago, but
now the thoroughfare was slushy, and
there was a sound like kneading dough
as the crowd jostled hither and- thither.
Home blessed and some cursed, "some
laughed and some cried, some shrieked
and some grunted â but all in a broth
erly and frank manner. What a varie
ty of voices! Small, piping, baby
voices; healthy, sweet, contralto
voices; â¢so-ur, quarreling voices; soft,
plaintive voices; harsh, guttural, dis
agreeable voices. What types of faces
and what, fashions of dress! Aged, de
crepit Jews with maps of Jerusalem
(at the time of the destruction) ~ on
their faces; fresh," blooming faces
marred only by merciless poverty and
suffering; worn-out women with wrin
kled and withered bodies;, and
young, women with lustrous black hair
and. sparkling eyes for which. Fifth
avenue ladies would have gladly ex
changed their Jewels. .
I looked at this curious and pathetic
scene. "This misery is the work of
cruel persecution,",! murmured'to my
self. Jewesses with shriveled faces
and dim, once-brilliant eyes, carrying
big baskets on their arms, passed me
and murmured mechanically in/ plain

pocketsâ I â¢ had only . six dollars and

After a few minutes we.. began to

me feel at home. After short reflec

"Why, you /don't know anybody elsa
here in America," put in Mr. Takiff.
"Stay here over Shabbos, and Sunday
I will find you a lotlging."
This Ghetto life appeared very
strange .to me after I had been away
from it so long. I had come to dislike
itâ at times I even detested it. Yet
now I found it pleasant; their friendly
talk, their cordial welcome, their sin
cere hospitality warmed my forlorn
heart.
Ab soon as I was strong enough to
walk about he house I began' io worry
about the future. The remembrance
of Katia was as sweet as ever to me,
but with the thought of her came the
thought of baptism, and that pros
trated my mind. My conscience and
"Yes, I awoke. Russia is my father
land no longer. I can't stay In this
country. I expect to leave Europe and
all Christian nations forever. The na
tions that teach love in the name of
the crucified Jew do not practice it.
They never practice it. The Crusaders,
the auto-da-fe, the Russian knout, the
German pressâ they are all pursuing
the same end in the name of Christian
brotherhood. I shall flee to my Uncle
Ishmael and seek protection under
him. . He does not preach much, and
this leaves him more time to practice."

"You have been 111 for the last few
months to you do not know what is
going on among us now. There is a
movement among the Jews to go back
and colonize Palestine. A great num
ber of Jewish students of Kieff and
Kharkoff have abandoned their studies
and will sail in a few weeks for Pales
tine. I subscribed to this league^ tod.
Enough of this European civilization!
Back to our ancient fatherland, where
our prophets saw 'celestial visions and
preached peace; where David poured
forth his heavenly psalms: where the
earth was once saturated with the
blood of the Maccabeans; where the
precious relics of our history are en
tombed. I shall be happy to put on
the Arab's robe and turban and' till
the ground of my ancestors. No more
dreamingâ I have awakened at last"
Thus spoke Levinski, who had been
an ardent believer in assimilation two
months before. I could hardly believe
my ears; I thought I must be still de
lirious.
A vague recollection of the situation
in which I found the girl was now
coming back to me.
"How is the girl?" I asked after a
short pause.
"She stabbed herself in the abdomen
while being ravished, and she died from
the wound the next day," Levinski
said and sobbed again.
"After the riot broke out in Yellswet
grad, if j-ou remember that, a rumor
was circulated that a similar outbreak
was going to take place here on May
3. We sent a delegation to the Mayor
and asked him to station soldiers in
the most thickly populated Jewish
streets, but he bluntly replied: *I would
not trouble the soldiers for a pack of-
Jews.' However, the riot did not oc
cur on the day expected, but on the
next Sunday.
"I was a dreamer. We were all
dreamers who thought we had be

and we were leisurely enjoying our
time over a cigar when the tumult of
the rioters reached us. Thu first thins
that occurred to my mind was the pos

daughter, who lived in Llbedski. He
kept a Jewelry store and lived above it.

Mandel. a friend of mine, came up with
an ambulance. 1 left you in his care
and went in search of my uncle and
his daughter. I found tne girl in an
unconscious condition in the hallway."
Levinski put his handkerchief to his
face, but his voice betrayed that there

cry for ner father. This reminded me
of my uncle, and we went to search for
him. We looked througTi the house,
but he was not there. The furniture
was demolished and his uooks â for he
had a valuable libraryâ were stolen
and some were torn leaf from leaf.
Finally we found him lying in the back
yard with a fractured skuII. He had
died long before we had arrived.
"I could see that the girl's condition
was critical. When she gained con

had met his fate. Learning that the
mob was plundering downstairs, they
locked themselves in a dark room on
the second floor, hoping to save their
lives. But after the mob had finished
their diabolical work downstairs they
broke into the rooms upstairs and at
tacked the door of the room where they
were hidden. It was forced open and
the girl assaulted. She and her father
were armed with knives, but what

Levinski paused here and openly
broke into tears.
"The ravagers succeeded in wresting

again." '

"And bow long have you been here?"
1 asked.
"About eight years. I have tried
everything, but I find button-holing
the best business for me. And why did
I leave home?" He shrugged his
shoulders, answering a question I had
in my mind. "The town burned down
a second time and left me without a
position. What could I do at home? I
sailed for America."
After he had urged me a number of
times to call at his house, or If I did
not care to honor him in that way, at

left him clicking at els machine.

eyes to read another sign. I had some

that read, "Ten thousand hands
wanted," and realizing that 1 could

I of the shop.
"Any work?" I asked.
Here again I found one man bent al
most double over a sewing-machine
and pushing a piece of skin under the
needle.
"No," he answered.
"Whrrâ whrrâ whrrâ rrr." the ma
chine whired and hummed.
I pointed to the placard in the win-
Sdow.
He glanced at me scrutinizing me
from the crown of my head to the
narrow-pointed tips of my foreign
shoes, and laughed. "Oh. I see you're a
'greener.' Of course I want ten thou
sand hands to wear my gloves."
, I went to my lodging and stretched
myself upon my bed, lost in a sea of
despairing thoughts.
CHAPTER IV.
IN A "SWEAT SHOP."
I The same evening I had a long con
sultation with Mr. Takiff and Malke
(her husband being out for business
most of the time), and though the lat
ter strenuously objected and the form
er grumbled that the handicraft of a
V plain workman was altogether unbe-
I coming for me. I decided to learn shlrt
) making at Mr. Levando's. I realized
that at present I could not depend on
my knowledge of languages to make
a living.
Mr. Levando's shirt factory was on
the third floor of a rickety old frame
house among the tall tenements of
Suffolk street, in the heart of New
York's Jewry. The dingy building,
once red. but now the color of the gut
ters, stood prominent among the other
1 buildings by reason of its very hum
bleness. Under one of the windows
was nailed an unassuming square sign
bearing .the inscription: "D. Levando,
shirt manufacturer."
At sight of me Mr. Levando dropped
thÂ» shirt on which he was working and
i came forward with a beam of welcome
I in his eyes. "Well!" he said with a
I sigh, "though it grieves me to see a
university graduate taking up a handi
craft. I'll be glad to teach you the trade
since you can do Tiothlng better."
The next day I started on my new
career. Daniel. Mr. Levando's young
est son, was my instructor. After a
few days' practice I was able to work
and talk at the same time. I found the
small company exceedingly pleasant.
Occasionally we would indulge In long
discussions. We talked philosophy,
poetry, religion, economics â of Russia
(with a pang at my heart), of her lit
erature, of her Jews, and of her inhu
manity.
Daniel Levando was of a quiet dispo
sition; he always looked sad and
dreamy. His eyes showed that he was
keenly critical, but the lower part of
his face told that he was easily moved
by emotionsâ by pity, sympathy, love.
Though his profile, his thoughtfulness.
and his peculiar sadness showed his
Hebrew lineage clearly enough, his
type was not purely Semitic.
Several months passed, full of ex
hausting work, but made almost
pleasant by agreeable companionship.
I had almost become accustomed to the
sweat shop and to work with my
hands, but I felt that the machine was
gradually undermining my constitu
tion. My cheeks faded, and I coughed
quite often, especially at night. I real
ized I ought to give up shirt-making,
but at the same time I felt it discreet
not to do so until I saw better pros
pects ahead.
Mr. Levando sold most of his product
to one firm, Mark Fetter & Co., promi
nent wholesale dealers in men's furn
ishing goods, and the tenement where
the Levando family worked and lived
xcas owned by the head of the firm,
Mark Fetter, a German Jew. This
firm was far from popular with the
Levandos. "I would rather go to a
pack of wild dogs than on these er
rands," Daniel would often confide to
me when his father sent him to deliver
shirts. And Daniel's opinion was the
opinion of his father and brother.
One warm afternoon in the early fall,
â¢when we were driving our machines at
full speed, Mr. Levando returned from
a call upon Mark Fetter & Co. in a
very happy frame of mind. "I have a
b!g order, and I hope we shall have
steady work all winter," he announced
joyfully as soon as he was in the shop.
"Were you at Fetter's?" asked his
eldest son.
Mr. Levando's happiness subsided
very suddenly. "Yes. He tried to
squeeze us again."
"Oh. that Mark Fetter!" muttered
Daniel. "I'd rather starve than take
work from that fellow."
"Daniel." replied the father softly,
â¢â¢you know how much I love that
haughty fool with the glasses, but
\rhat can we do at present? He buys
most of our goods, and we must endure
him till we have worked ourselves up
a little, and then we can shake him off
entirely."
"Whrrr â â¢whirr â whrrr â rrr â
whzzz," went the machines, and we fell
to work again at full speed.
One of the girls, about 17 and very
pretty, began to sing a popular love
song. Several of us tried to Join in,
but she song so much better than any
of us that we stopped and let her carry
the song alone. It brought back to me
recollections that were sweetly painful,
and unconsciously I let my foot rest
quietly on the treadle. The singer,
however, worked on automatically as
she poured forth her soul in the song.
"Stop!" cried Mr. Levando suddenly.
The song broke off abruptly, and we
all looked up. A tall, solidly built man,
I with a hooked nose and piercing black
; eyes that glared behind glasses, stood
' by the door, like a tyrannical general
surveying an army. He was bandy
legged, with a crop of curly hair, bushy
black mustache, and narrow forehead.
He looked fiercely around him without
a stir, not even a bow to Mr. Levando.
"Good afternoon, Mr. Fetter." The'
"boss" btmed obsequiously, . but the
visitor did not respond by even so
much as a nod of Tils head.
"How many dozen shirts do you
make a day, Levando?" asked Mr. Fet
ter superciliously, his glance not upon
Ihe one he addressed, but wandering
abc-ut the room, scrutinizing every
thing and everybody in the small shop.
Mr. Levando answered humbly. Then
he added: "You buy most of them, and
the rest 1 sell to another house."
"You Russians want the earth with
the fence around it," Mr. Fetter said
harshly. "When one gives you one"
hair you want the whole beard â hey.
Pullack?" (The German Jews and
their American extraction call any co
religionist Pullack who was not fortu
nate enough to have been born in Ger
many.)
"I grave you the first $10 to buy ma
terial," he continued, "and pledged my
credit for your machinery and tools,
and rented you these roams for $22,
which are worth $25 at least, with the
clear understanding that you must not
sell your goods to any one else. 1 found
out the other day that you sell goods to
another firm at the same prices you do
to me." He spoke cruelly and moved
his fierce black eyes right and left.
"But Judge for yourself, sir," said
Mr. Levando in self-Justification. "We
made no agreement to this effect, and
how could I possibly make a decent
living for my family by depending
solely upon you? And your prices are
so low."
"Why, your boys make about $8 a
week, you told me, and your work is
worth about the same. Isn't that
enough for a livelihood?" Mr. Fetter
asked this with an air of astonishment,
as he might wonder at the income of
the Rothschilds not being enough for a
family's support. "Did you make more
in Russia or Poland, wherever the devil
you came from?"
"Oh, In Russia." sighed Mr. Levando,
as if that word wounded him â "in Rus
sia I had my own houses, and did not
have to pay $22 for five small rooms." .
"You Pullacks become actually wild
when you come over to- this country.
No wonder the Czar is driving you peo
ple out. You wish to grab everything
â everything. Have 5 r ou ever lived in a
house in the country where you came
from with such big windows as thisâ
hey? Here you want nice carpets and
nice stoves and perhaps a piano, too.
All your people are a lot of schnorrers
(beggars), one as bad as the other."
We all kept our faces down and" our
feet pressing the treadles softlyâ all
except Daniel, who had been cutting a
thickly folded pad of linen. He now
laid down his long: cutter's knife and
moved about restlessly, his face glow
ing with intense agitation.
"How much do you make a week?"
Mr. Fetter asked of our prlma donna,
who blushed and looked up at the
"boss." He gave her a wink, which
she evidently interpreted "higher
price," but as half a dollar was a big
sum to her. she answered: "Six dollars
and a half."
"You Pullack! Schnorrer!" Mr. Fet
ter shouted indignantly, as if he would
play philanthropist. "You only pay
$6 50 to such a big grown girl, and you
wish to become a millionaire and have
a piano in your house â hey?"
"But how can I pay more when the
prices I get for my goods are bo low?
Raise the prices on my shirts and HI
raise wages." Mr. Levando's face grew
red with subdued anger.
"A discount of four per cent will be
my terms for your goods henceforth.
Whouwill buy of you shabby Pullack,
and who will understand your broken
English and jabbering German?"
I noticed that Daniel's face burned
and that he quivered in every limb.
"But how can I live? The prices are
low enough as they are," the poor
"sweater" said Imploringly.
"Well," said Mr. Fetter in a slow,
staccato -like tone, "if you don't agree
I'll bundle you out with your cock
reaches, take away the machines, and
put in some other lousy Pull â "
"You dirty scoundrel! Get out of
here! and quick!" Daniel shouted,
jumping up, with his- cutter's knife
flashing in his trembling hand like a
sword. He looked fierce, almost wild â
like a young Italian bandit.
"Daniel!" cried his father in conster
nation. '
Mr. Fetter stepped toward the door
in alarm. "Keep that dog off," he or
dered "with a sneer. "
"Get out, or " shrieked the raging
youth.
"I'll teach you a lesson," Mr. Fetter
said fiercely between his teeth and
rushed out.
Perfect quiet reigned In the shop. No
one uttered a word. Mr. Levando re
mained standing, speechless, in the
middle of the room, his skull-cap push
ed back, exposing his high and broad
forehead, on which wrinkles appeared
and disappeared, and his shrewd, al
mond-shaped grayish-blue eyes filled
with tears. His eldest son.' being of a
very peaceful nature, looked a little an
gry with his younger brother for his
rashness, but there was at the same
time some satisfaction in his eyes. Fan
nie, our prima donna, stole admiring
glances through the corners of her eyes
at Daniel, and all of us regarded him
with a new respect in which there was
a little of fear. He sat down in his
chair and leaned his head on his bare
arm, the knife Btill clenched in his
hand, and his tears flowed profusely
upon the table littered with pieces of
linen and muslin.
CHAPTER V.
THE END 6*F THE SWEATSHOP.
The following morning. Just after we
had sat down to work, two men opened
the door and asked for David Levando.
Mr. Levando, who was stooping over
a large bundle of finished goodj which
he was preparing for delivery, Btralght
ened up, a trifle frightened, and asked
what was their wish. The younger of
the two men said he was a lawyer, and
that his companion was a constable,
and thereupon he produced a writ of
replevin. .Mr. Levando stared dazedly
at the two, and the rest of us sat be
wildered, with our feet motionless on
the treadles. Daniel was the first to
ask the attorney to explain what the
trouble was, to whose question the lat
ter explained very explicitly: "Mark
Fetter, who holds a chattel mortgage
on all of your belongings, replevins the
goods instead of commencing foreclo
sure proceedings."
"But, if you please," the poor mort
gager pleaded with the lawyer, "I only
owe Mr. Fetter $45 on this mortgage
and my machines and other goods are
well-nigh worth $1000." .
"Well, you will have the chance to
prove this in court," the attorney re
plied with a smile, as if to say:,:"I
know your tricks. ",Â¦ "I have got the
notes in my possession, and they show
an indebtedness of 5573, besides inter
est at S per cent for one year and three
months."
"But I have paid all tjiis but $45.
It was deducted from my bills when I
delivered goods Â»to him. The interest
was figured in the principal when he
loaned me the money." There were
tears in the eyes of the unfortunate
"sweater."
â¢'Well, you'll have your say in court',"
the attorney replied shortly. And turn-
Ing to the constable he said: "Call up
your men and begin to pack up."
The constable opened the door and
shouted down the stairs: "Oh, Bill!
Come up!" Two men immediately ap
peared.
"Youse , ladies and gentlemen will
have to get up,", the constable said,
turning to us operators.
All of us arose instantly; some of us
trembled, for the fear of legal author
ity generated by Russian tyranny and
oppression was still strong In those of
us who were not long from our native
land of barbarism. We stood huddled
together In a corner, full of pity and
sympathy for our poor employer, who
remained standing in the middle of the
room, with his skull cap on the back
of his head, his hands clasped in front
of him, and tears gathering in his al
mond-shaped eyes.
'"You may still have the goods," said
the lawyer phllanthropically, "if you
pay us the full amount of these notes,
and for" your sake I'll throw off half
the interest."
"But I only owe him $45!" Mr. Le
vando ' returned imploringly. "And
even those $45 Â§ can't pay him to-day.
-We agreed. thai Mr. Fetter should de
duct this sum from the next five bills
of goods."
"Well, you'll tell your tale in court,"
the lawyer responded nonchalantly.
"Hurry up and get these things out,"
he said to the constable and his as
sistant.
While we were all watching them car
ry out Mr. Levando's machines â our
bread-winnersâ a policeman entered
and asked for Daniel. The officer read
to the trembling youth a warrant which
charged him with assault with intent
to kill. A sad smile played on the boy's
lips as the officer took him by the
arm and led him away.
Mr. Levando left all his belongings to
the mercy of the constable and follow
ed the officer and his son. And a short
while later the little sweatshop was
quiet â without a whirr of a machine,
without a click, without the sound of
a voice â quiet and empty!
CHAPTER VI.
I APPLY FOR AID AND GET SOME
THING ELSE.
In the afternoon I went to Mr. Le- ,
vando's home. He was utterly ex
hausted from running about to procure
the release of his son, whose bail had
been fixed at $1000. Those of his friends
who were willing to give ball had no
property, and those who had feared to
stake it. The family was a picture of
distress. Mrs. Levando lay on a couch,
moaning and crying: the oldest son sat
helplessly on the arm of a rocking
chair, with his head drooped and his
hands clasped around his knees, and
Mr. Taklff puffed at his pipe and cursed
the "golden land,", its people and its
laws.
"Blazes to this country with her Jus
tice!" he complained bitterly. "It's
worse than Russia "
"A thousand times worse," struck in
Mrs. Levando.
"Who ever heard," resumed Mr.
Taklff wrathfully, "that a boy of 17
years should be locked up under $1000
bail?"
Mrs. Levando groaned, "01, my dear
childâ my Daniel, he will have to stay
in Jail overnight!'' and she burst anew
into a flood of tears.
"And he says America is a good
country." Mr. Taklff turned to his
brother-in-law, his eyes full of an
ger.
I slipped out of this house of sorrow
and walked along Canal street, think
ing how I could be of some assistance
to them. Mrst the idea of my helping
them seemed absurd, as I had only a
dollar and some cents in my possession.
Then a hopeful thought cleared the
gloom from my mind. "The Jews in
general have always been charitable."
. But to whom could I apply? I scarcely
knew any one. Of course I had heard
of Jewish philanthropists in New York,
but how could I reach those magnani
mous men? Then I thought of the
rabbis. Surely I could find some rabbi
who would help Mr. Levando, with a
recommendation at least, or Influence
Mark Fetter to drop his proceedings.
I had heard of Doctor Fuchs, who
was the rabbi of a gorgeous uptown
synagogue, and who was renowned for
his erudition. I determined to apply to*
him for assistance. If he won't help
he won't harm, I assured myself. On
looking up his address in the directory
I found he lived far uptown, and my
capital was so scanty that I could hard
ly afford to spend 10 cents for car fare.
I hesitated long before I decided to
take a Third-avenue elevated train. "If
I do hot find the rabbi it means 10
cents wasted," I reflected, and started
out on foot. I walked several squares
and stopped. "Nearly ninety squares."
I hesitated and again fumbled the
dime in my pocket, whirled it, fon
dled it, and unconsciously began climb
ing the stairs to the elevated station.
I found the houBe that I sought, but
its elegance frightened me. so I walked
past it to the next corner. Then I
plucked up cburage, and returning I
ascended the stoop and timidly pulled
the knob of the doorbell. I heard its
tinkling deep within the house, and an
echo, I thought, sounded deep within
me. I felt awkward, and stood before
the house like a tramp waiting for a
sandwich.
The door opened and a pretty German
servant girl (I could, not help thinking
of her beauty) stuck out her head and
glanced at me and asked me what I
wished. In much embarrassment I told
her that I wished to see Rev. Doctor
Fuchs. She showed me into the recep
tion room and disappeared with my
request.
' In a few minutes, which seemed dou
ble their number, a middle-aged, obese
woman of medium height, with a flat
nose, double chin and green eyes,
rustled into the room, panting as she
walked, her diamond earrings bobbing
and twinkling. She contracted her eye
lids, as if to get a better look at me,
In order to judge what reception to give
me. Evidently the impression was not
favorable, for her face assumed a sour
expression as" she said to me: "Doctor
Fuch iss taking his avternun nap from
onr> to two." . \
"I'll wait until the Doctor gets up,"
I said in a humble tone.
I waited and yawned and -waited. I
studied the color of the " carpet, the
wall paper, and counted the books in
the two cases. I noticed a paper lying
on a chair close to mine, and I picked
it up. At this movement on my part
the flat nose and green eyes were again
framed between the curtains.
Finally, after I had scrutinized every
thing about me, heavy steps reached
my ears.' I divined the coming of Rab
bi Fuchs. I cleared my throat, passed
my hand down over the buttons of my
waistcoat, passed my slim fingers
through my hair to arrange it in poetic
disarrangement, and awaited his arri
val. He appeared at the door and
measured me from the soles of my torn
shoes to the top of my untrimmed hair
in one glance from his, steady, cold
eyes. He was a little taller than his
wife and almost as fat, and his grayish
beard was closely trimmed. His nose
was aquiline, and purple at the end,
which I thought (mistakenly, perhaps)
resulted from a too zealous worship of
Bacchus. He wore a white tie and a
high waistcoat, whichâ so my fancy
struck me â gave him the full appear
ance of the Almighty's coachman. His
forehead was originally not high, but
it was heightened and broadened by
his partial baldness. %
I rose and bade him "good after
noon," to which he bowed perfunctorily. ,
He did not ask me to sit down, so I
told him my story standing, expiating
especially on the high position of the
Levandos in former days. He listened
as members of his congregation listen
to his sermons,' I thought; but he did
not.fall asleep. He stood with his hands
in his trousers pockets, unmoved by my
tale of woe as his congregation by his
lectures, I fancied. Several times I no
ticed a spasmodic shake of his head, as
if he wished to interrupt me, but he
waited without a word to the end of
my speech. This politeness, flashed
through ray mind, he had also learned
from his flock.
"Oh, yes, you Russians are ever dis
satisfied with work and look for some
thing easy," he said coldly. "Anarch
ism, socialism, nihilism, and all kinds
of isms â that's all you care about. I.
can't do anything for you. There are
Hebrew charity societies and hospitals
which do all they can for paupers and
Immigrants."
"But you must realize," I pleaded,
almost with tears in my eyes, "the
injustice of Mr. Fetter In trying to ruin
this noble family, that has worked in
a 'sweatshop' in order to make an hon
est living. I do not ask of you anything
but merely to go and see Mr. Fetter on
behalf of these unfortunate people, and
he will not be so hard upon them."
"I know you Russians," he said im
patiently. "Well, this you have for
your trouble," he added with a mean
ing smile, drawing half a .dollar from
his pocket and handing it to me.
At this I lost my control. I spat on
his outstretched hand and shrieked at
the highest pitch of my voice: "Hypo
crite! high-toned beggar! I ask no alma
of you, stone-hearted rabbi in Israel!"
He grew as white as the tie he wore
around his neck, and his. fat wife, who
had been watching us between the cur
tains, rushed to the front door and
cried: "Police! Police."
An officer answered the call with a
f promptness that ought to be recorded
in the history of the police department.
"Dis Russian anarchist vanted to
sjhoot my husband if he vouldn't give
him a t'ousand t'alers." Mrs. Fuchs ex
plained to the officer. Rabbi Fuchs
stood dumfounded and trembling.
"Come along â come along," said the
officer, giving me a few touches from
his club. "We have a good place for
anarchists who throw bombs." He laid
hold of my arm, gripped it tightly, and
led mÂ«Â» out of the house.
. Some people- appeared on the neigh
boring stoops; servant girls stood in
the doors and windows, with their
aprons rolled around their clasped
hands, looking at the officer and his
prisoner. A driver Jumped off his
wagon, and leaving his horses standing
ing .the middle of the street eagerly in
quired: "What's the matter?" An in
creasing crowd of boys followed us ex
citedly as we walked toward the cor
ner.
The policeman telephoned for another
officer to take me to the station, and
while we waited for his arrival a large
crowd gathered around us, asking one
another: "What's the matter?" I
heard several voices answer: "An an
archist." "He was going to shoot Doc
tor Fuchs."
I heard all this as if in a dream. I
became so confused that I lost my
memory and did not know what had
happened. A cold drizzle began to fall.
I kept my eyes on the ground and wish
ed for some open grave below. One of
tho crowd shouted: "Look at his face!
Look at his eyes! He shot Rabbi
Fuchs!"
"Did I?" I asked myself. I did not
know then. Perhaps I had shot him.
In a comparatively short time an
other officer arrived and took me toHhe
station. TheÂ»desk sergeant asked my
name (which J. had given as Russ)
and inquired regarding my nationality.
They searched my pockets, in which
they found a dollar and a few cents.
Then I was locked up.
When I sat down on the bunk in my
dark room I realized' what had happen
ed to me that afternoon. My expecta
tions were gone, and now I was con
fined in a murky cell with a lot of crim
inals. Criminals, did I say? They were,
perhaps, Justas much criminals as I.
How I spent that night I leave to the
reader's imagination.
The next morning about 10 o'clock I
was taken to the police court and there
brought before the magistrate.
The prosecutor read a long list of ac
cusations against me in a voice like
the conductors' who call out streets,
and I could only catch, "What have
you got to say for yourself?"
"Not guilty," I stammered.
The officer who had arrested me was
called to the witness-stand and stated
all he knew, or rather all he did not
know.
The rabbi did not appear, so there
was no evidence against me.
However, the Judge dipped his pen
In the inkstand, and looking at me over
his spectacles, said: "Thirty days and
costs."
CHAPTER VII.
AN OLD FRIEND.
As soon as I was set free I repaired
to Mr. Levando's home, but found an
other family in their place. After some
inquiries I was I Informed that some
kind of a settlement had been effected
between Mr. Levando and Mr> Fetter,
and the former, in company with his
brother-in-law, had left ihe city. I
did not care to go back to my old
-boarding place, for I was utterly weary
of Shmunke, so I found new lodgings.
I was again without friends In the sor
did Ghetto.
My five weeks of Imprisonment had
left a deep impression upon me. I had
been getting thin while I worked at
the sweatshop, and now I began to spit
blood. I consulted ' a physician, who
admonished roe not to take up my old
trade again. But he encouraged me
and said there was no Immediate dan-
ger if I should take good care of my
self.
One night, after I had spent two- or
three hours in aimless wandering, I de
cided to go to a cafe on East Broadway
which I frequented and rest for a while
over a glass of tea. One could get here
a good glass of tea for 5 cents and read
Russian, German and English papers
to his heart's content, and here one
Was likely to meet at any time of the
day and before 2 o'clock in the morn
ing Russian Jewish students who fled
from gymnasiums and universities, and
some from Siberia, discussing social
ism, anarchism, philosophy, religion
and noetry. The restaurant was owned
by a Russian, who, while waiting on
customers, usually took part in all the
discussions, and could not determine
himself whether he was an anarchist,
socialist, pessimist, or philosopher. He
had been a student at Lodi. Poland,
and later had tilled the stony fields of
Palestine a few years.
Coming in now, I found the cafe well
filled.
Presently when I looked up my eyes
were caught immediately by a new
comer who had Just Joined the. group
of young men. His back was toward
me. but a glance at him was sufficient.
I hurriedly rose from my chair and
clapped my hand upon his shoulder.
"Ephralm!" I cried Joyously.
. He looked about, then sprang to his
feet. "Why, Israel! You in America?"
Without waiting for my reply, he ex
cused himself and we went off to his
room, talking volubly all the while.
"I thought you were digging gold for
the Czar," I remarked when we had
taken off our hats and settled into
comfortable chairs.
' "No, I knew better," he smiled, "and
thought Siberia would be too cold for
me."
! He coughed violently, and took off
his glasses, which he put carefully o-n
his desk.
I observed his face by the yellowish
light of the lamp that burned on the
desk, and a shudder passed through
me.' It was thin and haggard; his
long hair was neglected; his mus
tache was heavy and long, which made
his cheeks appear still more hollow.
But his eyes glittered with the same
oM flre.
"How did you escape? How did you
come here? What have you been doing
since?" I showered questions at him.
"I have not as many adventures to
tell of as you imagine," Ephraim said,
feigning to smile. "I was confined
about seven months in a dark and
filthy cell, in which big rats kept me
company and had occasional fights
over a crust of bread that the turnkey
had brought me. They claimed share
and share alike, and I never denied
them their rights.
He paused and his face resumed a
bitter expression.
"But I did come out after seven
months of brooding and reflection," he
resumed. "There was no strong evi
dence against me, so I was released.
As soon as I was set free I hastened to
Levinski. 'He left for Palestine/ his
housekeeper told me. I tried to find
friend after friend. 'In Palestine' or
'In America' were the answers I got
everywhere. I had hardly an acquaint
ance left in Kieff. I hardly knew what
to do. Weak from my long confine
ment, made friendless by Russian bar
barism, I grew despondent and thought
of suicide. I am ashamed of myself
now; but you must remember the con
dition I was in. I carried poison about
me for days, but finally I regained con
trol of myself and decided to come to
this country.
Later in the evening our talk turned
to religion, and I was surprised that he
hated reformed Judaism even more
than he hated orthodox Judaism In the
old days at Javolin and Kleff.
"So you are against reformed Juda
ism and you advocate the old belief,"
I casually remarked, laughing as I said
this.
He looked at me seriously for a mo
ment and his pale cheeks colored.
Lighting a cigarette, he puffed violent
ly in silence for a while. Then he fixed
his fiery eyes upon me and. while
spurts of smoke issued rapidly from
his mouth, he said: "Yes, I am against
American reformed Judaism as such.
I don't object to it as a separate
creed, or rather the aping of a creed;
but it is not religion â to be sure,' not
the religion of Judaism. Religion, and
Judaism in particular, is poetry â and
nothing but poetry. Or rather It is
poetry for one and science for another.
To the philosopher, searcher after
truth, it 1b dry science ad finem,
proved by algebraic formulas, and by
the process of elimination gives a big
zero. To mankind at large, in its pres
ent state of development, it is poetry
pure and simple â poetry which cannot,
must not be analyzed by a mathemati
cal process. Religion, no more than the
'Divine Comedy' or 'Paradise Lost.' can
be reduced to prosaic accuracy. For as
soon as we attempt to inquire into
their truth Dante and Milton become
maniacs."
He spoke bitterly, brilliantly, puff
ing at cigarette after cigarette and in
haling all the smoke, his hair tumbled,
his eyes darting fire, his body all
aquiver from intellectual passion. I
listened to him till 2 o'clock.
Friendless as I was, I was glad in
deed to meet Razovskl again. How
ever, he could offer me no aid, so I had
to continue my blind search for a job.
Bo my financial condition grew acute
and despair began to take hold of me.
-CHAPTER VIII.
ASSISTANCE COMES UNEX
; PECTEDLY.
It must have been a week later that*
starting out of my room to get my sup
per, I happened to recall a cheap Jew
ish restaurant that had recently been
opened in Hester street, and thither I
decided to go. In my better days I had
been accustomed to eating In restau
rants on East Broadway, but twenty
five cents was the price of a "regular
supper" in those eating-places, and
that sum I now regarded as extrava
gant.
This restaurant was in the basement
of a six-story tenement house, and
though a new establishment, it had
won a speedy reputation. Its cheap
ness was its best advertisement. I
stopped before a big sign with yellow
letters that read In Yiddish
"A regular dinner and supper, the best
and most relishable Jewish dishes, as
those in Poland, with a glass of beer and
two cigarettes, for 9 cents: with chicken,
10 cents. Strictly kosher."
I did not care for its being strictly
kosher, but it was strictly cheap, which
was enough to attract me. I looked
through the window, and finding' the
room well filled with shabby people- 1
hesitated to enter. But the "9 cents"
on the big sign was an inducement I
could not withstand, and I went in and
sat down at a small table intended for
two. â¢ Wf Â¦.â¢*.Â¦;
The customers came and went. I
paid little attention to any of them
till I noticed a man in a long, heavy
ulster covered with snow, his hat
drawn clown over his eyes.
slowly down the restaurant, keenly e> -
ing every customer. He was of me
dium height, with a pointed brown
beard, lively dancing eyes that beto<
kened shrewdness conceit and suspi
cion and a straight nose which pave
the owner a certain dignity of appear
ance. His eyes took me in while he
was yet several tables away. He
passed two or three vacant places and
stopped at my table. He took his bis
ulster off and hun* It on the back of
his chair, and then, without removing
his hat. sat down, rubbing his hands
and emitting a soft sigh.
"It's getting cold," he said to me in
Yiddish. , '. . ,
'â¢It is." I answered abruptly, for his
appearance had aroused my dislike and
I did not care to talk to him.
The waiter brought me the Borsch,
and I hungrily began on the sour soup.
My unwelcome tablem.ite first washed
hia hands, according to the orthodox
ritual. He recited aloud the appropri
ate benediction over the bread, and
took a big bite thereof, trying to draw
the attention of other people to* his
piety.
He talked about the condition of la
bor on the East Side for a while, then |
very deftly shifted the one-sided con
versation to religion: "The love for
Judaism, the religion their fathers
valued so preciously, is entirely extin
guished from the hearts of the younger
generation. The Russo-Jewish intelli
gent young men who fledâ or. rather.
have been expelled â from the colleges
and- universities despise that old Juda- |
ism with its mystic ceremonies and ab- "
surd formalities. A pure monotheistic
belief, shrouded In a cloud of cere
monies and symbols, may be beautiful,
but It is by no means tenacious on the
human mind. It may be good philoso
phy, but it is poor religion. At least,
it is too remote for the average brain
to grasp. It Is belief in something of
which we have no conception at all.
Don't stare at me so wildly. I know
my people. I have lived and suffered
with them and for them and from
them. I once shared their hopes, their i
Ideas, their beliefs." '
He paused and looked at me steadily
for a few seconds. His last words were
enigmatic, being so contradictory to his
actions at first.
Then he resumed in a low tone:
"These Russian-Jewish students de
spise their ancestral belief; bjn to ac
cept the more liberal and more human
Christian religion In the land of ty
ranny would be degrading. The Jew
likes to do everything voluntarily, but
nothing under compulsion. He pos
sesses the true spirit of the poet and
the martyr. Coming over to this coun
try and finding most of their country
men in a deplorable condition, and on
the other hand the 'reform' Jews, who
are of the wealthier class, repelling
them, these young Russians have
drifted away from both. The former
would not assist them because they are
irreligious, and the later excuse them
selves because they claim thoae Rus
sians have too many ideas. Besides,
reformed Judaism cannot attract these
enlightened young men. That creed
has no life, no vitality, neither as a re
ligion nor as a philosophic theory; and
its professors adhere to it from sheer
fashion or perhaps because they fear
the aversion of their Christian neigh
bors, who dislike infidels. Some of
these young men, in fact, find some so
lace in socialism. What are anarch
ism and socialism if not the impulses
of ambition that fall short? Anarchism
Is no idea at all; It is merely the hatred
that springs up In the breast of a
stripped rival. When one loses in a
race he is more likely to find fault with
the winner for his own defeat than
with himself. Hence socialism and
anarchism.
"The only remedy for these Intelli
gent young men is to adopt a new
faith that will stream fresh blood, so
to speak, in their veins and resuscitate
themâ I mean Christianity. They
would also get some help from Chris
tian philanthropists, and would con
tinue to lead the life they had dreamed
of in their native land."
He stopped talking and cut the meat
the waiter had set before him.
"You were innocently convicted sev
eral weeks ago," he went on. ""Who
was at fault but the haughty rabbi?
It was not because he hated you indi
vidually; he hated your nationality.
The wealthy American Jews are retali
ating on their own poor co-religionists
for the prejudice they suffer from the
gentiles. They look down upon you
Russians, with all your intelligence,
unsurpassed liberality and broadmind- ,
edness, and, if possible, ostracize you I
from their clubs and societies. But the I
American gentile has no such feeling. '
He would be willing to accept your
company and friendship. In short, my
friend, I can help you," he ended sig
nificantly, "and you will be able to
earn your livelihood easily and pursue
your studies besides if you like."
He now arose to leave, and finding
me silent said: "Think it over. My
name is Gavniack. I'll see you to-mor
row."
Saying this he threw a $10 bill upon
the table and hurried out of the res
taurant before I could stop him. I ran
after him to return his money, but he
was lost In the crowded street.
CHAPTER DC j
THE MISSIONARY AGAIN. (
Coming home the following day. I
found my landlady in tears. The
youngest girl was sick, and she had not
a cent with which to buy the pre
scribed medicine. I owed her a little
over $6. but she did not even hint for
it. However, I felt myself guilty of a
gross wrong; the little girl might die
for want of medicine, and I had the
money! I put my hand Into my pocket
and crumpled the $10 bill, hesitating
what to do. "It Is not mine," I argued
with myself; "how* can I give it
away?" "But the sick child might die."
another thought protested.
I quickly drew out the money and
handed it to the landlady, who was
looking at her poor child with tearful
eyes. "Here Is your $6 15. You will
bring me the change."
She wiped away her tears and looked
at me a trifle abashed, probably won
dering how I came by that fortune.
"God knows the truth, I did not mean
to press you," she apologized. "I know
that you would have paid me long ago
if you had only had it, but I was sim
ply giving vent to my bitter heart."
Then I worried again because I had
used the missionary's money. I began
to walk the floor of my room restlessly.
The walls, the celling, the very air of
the inclosure put a certain burden, so
to speak, upon my brain and nerves. I
wished I could shake off everything
from my mind. So I took a stroll
through the dingy streets. Razovski's
talk and the incident I had experienced
with the rabbi came back to my mindTHE SAN-'-, FRANCISCO. SUNDAY CALL.

like a past dream. "Judaism is de
clining; reform Judaism is a sham and
orthodoxy an absurdity; the Jews are
hated by all. and the Russian Jews are
prejudiced by the American and na
turalized German Jews. For shame! I
should beg of Jews to tolerate me.
Jews that entertain prejudice against
any of their brethren deserve no re
gard. no respect. I should rather
starve in the streets of the liberal me
tropolis than apply for aid to the vain,
vealthy merchant who would perhaps
Bxioff and sneer at the despised Russian
student before he would condescend to
, consider his tale of woe."
One cold December evening I visited
the nine-cent restaurant, as usual, and
waited there rather long-, with a hope
that the missionary might appear. And
suddenly he opened the door.
He rubbed his hands as he came up
i to rr.e. I resented his pious mannerâ I
1 resented his appearance; but I was
I starving and expected help from him.
' He shook my hand warmly and ex
plained that he had been out of town
i ever since he saw me last, trying to
) organize a Christian-Jewish mission in
a email town in Connecticut. He invited
me to go to a decent restaurant. I ac
cepted his invitation.
When we had finished the meal, dur
ing which he drank heavily of wine, he
Faid in Hebrew in his lowest possible
> tone, "Art thou for us or for our ad
versaries?" and smiled an insinuating
smile.
My answer stuck in my throat.
1 "I hope you have by this time appre-
I elated the truth of my statement." , he
7 said. He puffed out a thick volume ot
f smoke and looked straight at me with
his little eyes, that betrayed the effect
of the wine he had drunk.
. "Come, let us go to some place where
we can talk more freely," he said after
I had continued in my Filence for a
minute or two. "And where we can
pet gDod wine," he added. What did
Luther say?â
"Wer nlcht Debt Weln. \T<Hb. und Gesangr,
1 Der bleibt ein Xarr eein Leben lang.'
Ha! ha! ha! It takes a poet to say that
and a missionary to practice it. Ha:
ha! ha; Come â we'll have a chat."
) CHAPTER X.
A CHAT WITH THE MISSIONARY.
"We got on an elevated car at Grand
street and rode uptown. We alighted at
the Fifty-ninth street station and
walked several blocks to a fashionable
' apartment-house, in which he said he
lived. In the small corridor he pressed
one of a number of buttons, and some
body called throujrh the speaking tube.
"Open, Martha! " the missionary an
swered.
[ I heard a click, and he opened the
Â» door of the hall.
"One flight up." he said to me as he
ran up the stairs. He led me up the one
flight and knocked at a door. It was
opened by a tall, well-shaped woman,
vi ho smiled on Gavniack as we entered.
Â» It struck me that her smile was hardly
1 the smile of a wife.
n We went through a room which I
/ noted in passing was expensively fur
nished, and entered a room that was
i half-study, half-smoking-room. This,
) like the adjoining room, had been fur
nished at much expense. There was a
long black leather couch and two arm
chairs; on the wall hung a good pic
ture of the woman who had opened the
door for us. and opposite It hung a pic
ture of a beautiful little girl, who
looked like the miniature of the woman.
There was also a small, well-filled
bookcase and a couple of veil executed
places of marble.
He excused himself, but returned in
a few minutes. He drew the two arm
chairs close together and placed a small
round table between us. We had
scarcely seated ourselves when the
woman brought In some wine, oysters
and cigars and placed them on the ta
ble. She looked at me keenly as she put
the tray down, and a sudden warmth
passed over my face.
He did not introduce me to her, so I
concluded she was not his wife.
She was decidedly handsome, about 30
years old I judged, with full milky
cheeks, slightly tinged with crimson,
thick, Ught-brown hair and bluish
eyes with an experienced look in them.
Although I had always flattered myself
upon being a good physiognomist, I
could not at first tell her race or na
tionality. She looked like a charming
young Bauerin, full of rustic fascina
tion. However, after close observation
I discerned by her profile and medita
tive glance that she must have Jewish
blood in her veins.
She closed the door after her when
she left, and Gavnalck g'anced at me
through the corner of his eye â a little
suspiciously, I thought, though he
feigned to be looking at the picture op
posite him.
He filled both of our glasses and said:
"Drink. "Wine makes glad the heart of
man,* " quoting the psalm in the orig
inal. "The psalmist, like Luther, ap
preciated the mission of Bacchus â
hey?"
"Wine enters and secrets corce out,"
I thought, but I said nothing.
"l" could not do anything wito that
idealist, Razovski." he went oni "Our
profession needs young men liks him
and he Is worth his weight in gold.
But no inducement could bribe him.
(My heart throbbed with shame.* An
idealist Is the best tool for our p-ofes-

but of late it has become rather fash

grin. "Those Jews of greatest taent
and genius have tried to wash tlelr
birth off with the sacred water of t ne
font."
"Now, let us come to a clear unfljr

assumed a business-like air. "I kniw

He spoke In a cool, businesslike tone.
just as if he were hiring me to keep a
set of books. (
"I tell you," he proceeded, "there will
be a great future for you if you will
give up your notion of finishing your
medical course and become one of us.
Your information will bring you a for
tune. You have the equipment to make
a great success. Most of our mission
aries are ignoramuses, but the benevo
lent Christians don't know the differ
ence. They are bo glad to get a Jewish
convert who will proselyte among the
Jews that they trouble themselves very
little about his knowledge. Some of
the emigrants, however, have spoiled
our business horribly. It was discov
ered that some received baptismal fees
here in New York, sold their dead souls
in several Western cities and finally
returned to their old faith. That is
outrageousâ they are ruining us!
"Well,* it is then agreed between us:
you will furnish us with some material
for our Jewish-Christian periodical. I
am one of the editorial staff. Your
work will consist in making abstracts
from Jewish books or papers. For in
stance, when a Jewish editor complains
of Jewish indifference toward their re
ligion, make an abstract of this article
and send.it to us. It maks spicy stuff
for our paper. We'll speak about this
some other time. As to your payment,
things will be 'fixed bo you can pursue
your study of medicine. I have a letter
of recommendation for you from Dr.
P to the dean of the Medi
cal College. Â¦ It is early in the term and
you will be able to commence at once.
You agree?"
I dropped my eyes; shame almost
choked me. He laid down on the ta
ble the' letter of. recommendation, $25
and the address of a family with whom
I could get board; for he, certain of my
acceptance, had made all arrange
ments.
CHAPTER XI.
AN OLD FRIEND AGAIN.
A year glided by without any inci
dents worth putting on paper. I re
viewed my medical studies, and, by
hard work on my part and by con
siderable leniency on the part of the
college authorities, I was enabled to
enter the senior class the following au
tumn. That year marked a change
in me. Another resurrection, so to
speak â a new spring after my long,
dreary winter. My almost withered
end insipid brain regained fresh vigor.
I was filled with new hope, new
energy, and happy visions came be
fore me. I was alive once more. And
the thirst for study and reading as
sumed its power over me. â¢ x '
During that year I came in contact
very little with the missionary Gav
niack, nor did I see Razovski. With
the former I generally corresponded,
enclosing my abstracts, and the latter
I was ashamed to meet. I felt guilty,
and a guilty conscience fears the look
of the innocent. When my conscience
rebuked me in the silence of night,
when sentiments of truth and Integrity
stirred within me, when tears washed
my cheeks because of the base hypo
critical means by which I was earning
my livelihood, I would try to excuse
myself by saying that there was noth
ing wrong in my work itself â there
would be no -wrong in merely trans
lating and making abstracts from the
Talmud, which was all I did.
As I have said, I saw but little of
Gavniack. y I had not met him for six
months, when one afternoon in the
spring, while I was out for a stroll, I
met him by chance on Fifth avenue,
accompanied by a tall, broad-shoul
dered, handsome young man. A
glance â and this young man and I
pounced on each other and began
shaking hands.
"Dolgoff!" I ejaculated.
"Ivan Petrowitch!" he cried, ad
dressing me by the name in the pass
port he had furnished me in Vilno.
Gavniack shrank back* a step or two.
It was evident he found no pleasure in
the discovery of friendship between
Dolgoff and me. "You seem to know
one another?" he said.
"We're old friends," replied Dolgoff
in his gay, resonant voice.
While we were exchanging news
about ourselves Gavniack interrupted
to remind his companion that if they
lingered any longer they would be late
at the meeting of missionaries which
â¢was to take place that afternoon.
Dolgoff excused himself, saying he
â¢would rather spend the time chatting
with me. Gavniack hesitated a min
ute or two, then bade us farewell, and
Dolgoff â¢and I went to my lodging.
He was a trifle changed, but was as
handsome as ever. He was now better
developed, with soft black hair and
black eyes of the Jewish type, and In
all his beaming countenance showed
the same contentment as in former
days. His smooth-shaven face had
that physical beauty which is rarely
seen in the face of poets or thinkers.
"So you have become a missionary?"
I eaid. referring to his present occu
pation. ."How did you come to that
Gavniack?"
"The same inducement that made
you take the step," he said; at which
I felt my blood ascending to my face.
"I was confined in prison about a year,
but I finally succeeded in escaping.
First I went to Holland, but I
could not find any work to suit
me. One was too hard, another
too easy, and bo forth. I was
soon helpless and starving. But
God has never forsaken me altogether."
He smiled. "I came in contact with a
missionary who began to fish for my
soul. It did not take me long to strike
a bargain with him, and I got the best
of it. For my soul was worth very lit
tle, and my body was the whole world
to me. I lived six months in luxury
and got some money to boot for my
worthless souL
"But I soon tired of Amsterdam and
went to Hamburg. I had a little expe
rience in the business, and thought I
could speculate with my soul again. I
had never before appreciated what a
valuable *oul I possessed." He puffed
out a volume of smoke and chuckled
with some satisfaction. "In that God
fearing city the price of my soul
trebled. I got several hundred for it
from my godfather, who had a big bel
ly and a small brain, and I also got
some money from the missionaries. It
never rains but It pours. A nice Chris
tian girl fell in love with my black eyes
and curly hair, and she was frank
enough to tell me so., I did not object.
Who would? A girl is a girl. She was
so Innocent, so girlish, that I pould
have taken her to the end of the world
had I chosen. She believed in me as in
the Savior. A short time afterward I
got tired of her love and kisses and
skipped to London, with the intention
â¢ of taking up some honest trade. In
1 fact. I wished "to repent But the idling
missionary life had got its hold on me,
, and I changed my mind. Well, specu-
lation with my Â»oul is not bad, after
all, I thought. I soon found, another
customer for it. He was very religious
and charitable (the latter proved bene
ficial to me). At his home I met this
Gavniack. His name was Gordon then,
but I had known him by his former
names; he had many. I had known
him so well in the past that he thought
it wise to give me a friendly reception.
"One of his associates was a minister
of a rich congregation, a Jew by birth.
He was baptized at a very early age,
and, unlike other Jewish converts, he
was faithful to his adopted creed. He
loved the people of his race, and be
lieved that their only salvation would
come through- Christ. A Jewish con
vert to Christianity was a precious be
ing to him. Gavniack, with his flat
tery, won the confidence of that noble
minister, but that sly fox did not care
so much for the clergyman as for his
beautiful daughter, Martha,"
"Martha!" I interrupted, thinking of
the woman I had seen in Gavniack's
apartment a year before. .
He read my thought. "Yes; she's
with him here." A look of pain came
upon his face; and he was silent for a
minute.
He- paused and looked away from
me. After a minute he continued, his
voice somewhat husky: ;
"To be frank with you, Israel. I loved
Marthaâ even after she had disgraced
herself by running away with Gav
niack. I made up my mind to handle
him softly and find out about Martha
myself. A few months passed by, and
he was cunning enough to conceal her
whereabouts fom me. In the meantime
I thought it was foolish to refuse his
money. He is a clever missionaryâ
that we cannot deny. His 'face, his
low, musical voice, his shy look; his
humble demeanor â everything about
him shows qualifications for . his pro
fession. He is a genius in that field.
"Finally, however. I found her out.
He keeps her in-'a luxurious cage, and
she is afraid to fly away, though I
discovered that she hates him dread
fully. He brings everything to the
house, but he is careful not to give
her any money. She is his slave and
fears him. About three months after
she had left London she gave birth to
a child, and he got rid of it, I don't
know how. What a change there is
in that woman! She is about twenty
three years old, and she looks as if
she were thirty."
I could clearly see, from the expres
sion of his face and the tone of his
voice as he spoke of Martha, that he
was deeply moved.
"He certainly is a dastardly villain!"
I exclaimed, partly as an expression of
my loathing of Gavniack, partly as an
expression of my sympathy for Dol
goff.
"The devil's even blacker than I have
painted him," Dolgoff added somewhat
bitterly. "He was a Russian spy for a
while, and he has sent hundreds of
honorable people to Siberia. And I've
heard it rumored that he killed his own
father."
I started like one bitten by an asp.
I recalled what Dolgoff had said in
Kieff regarding my resemblance to
an old friend of his. A horrible sus
picion had flashed into my mind. I
dared not follow it farther. I quivered
with fear at this suggestive thought.
Fortunately, Dolgoff's face was turned
away, so he did not see how his words
had affected me; and when he left, a
few minutes later, he was so engrossed
with his own unhappy thoughts that
he evidently noticed nothing unusual
in my appearance.
CHAPTER XII.
THE WORLD IS QUITE SMALL.
AFTER ALL.
The evening. of the next day Gav
niack called upon me. His visit at
first surprised me, for he had not been
in my room for a year. However, I
soon divined from his desultory talk
that he had come to sound me, to
find out if Dolgoff had not spoken to
me regarding him. But I kept close
guard upon myself and evaded all his
dexterous questions.
He had risen to leave, "when he re
marked very casually: "By the by, I
met an old friend recently that I never
expected to see in this country. I hap
pened to speak of him to Dolgoff last
night, and he said you knew him,
too."
"Who is he?" I asked mechanically,
hardly having heard what he said, for
within I was a chaos of fear and sick
ening suspicion.
"I think you knew him in Kieff â
Bialnick's his name."
"What!" I cried. And suspicion and
fear for the time left me and I had
but one thought â Katia!
Gavniack's look was suddenly fast
ened upon me. "It seems you are very
much Interested in this aristocratic fu
gitive." â¢
I controlled myself with a great ef
fort. "I was very much Interested in
him before the massacre of the Jews
irl '81. He showed himself a great
friend of the Jews, and he supported
the Jewish emancipation movement
with all his might."
A peculiar smile played about Gav
niack's lips. "I knew him long before
that," he rejoined, and with an iron
ical chuckle he added: "He was no
friend of the Jews then â far from it."
"I think I'll look him up," I said,
assuming an air of indifference.
"Where's he living?"
Gavniack gave me Judge Bialnick's
address. He continued to chat for a
few minutes, but I had no interest in
his talk â my mind was with Katia. I
had almost forgotten his presence,
when I became aware that he had
picked up from the table the Hebrew
Bible mv mother had given me on her
death-bed.
"I see you are still a good Jew," he
said jovially.
"The book is an heirloom," I an
swered.
"H'm! The book does look rather
old." And bo saying he began to turn
the leaves to the first part of the book,
where our family history was written.
My heart began to beat violently â I
could feel it throb In my ears, in my
throat; my brain was whirling. I
turned and tottered to the window and
stood there, trembling, all in a daze.
I vaguely heard some words in a
strange, hoarse voice; I saw,- as if
through* a mist, a pair or ghastly eyes
staring in my direction; then the door
clicked. When I turned about he had
gone. -
CHAPTER XIII.
"THE VOICE OF MY BELOVED."
I spent a long, sleepless night. Strange
thoughts haunted my brain. As soon
as I would begin to think of Katia hor
rible incidents would crowd my mind.
"Perhaps it was Providence that sepa
rated me from the .daughter of my
father's slayer? Perhaps it was Prov
idence that put us asunder; because- 1
am a Jew and she a Christian?" I
brooded superstitiously. But instantly
my deep love for Katia filled me with
different thoughts. "What do the
terms Christian and Jew denote, after
all? I love nature; I love art; I love
humanity. What can any religion teach
me in addition to these principles?
Thus'I mused till the cheerful morn
ing sun dispersed the misty shroud that
hovered about me. I then put on my
best clothes and repaired to Judge Bial
nick, whose address Gavniack had
given me. I found it to be a fashion
able residence on Madison avenue.
I rang the bell and a servant ap
peared almost instantly.
"Is Judge Bialnick in?" I asked.
"Yes." Who shall I say wants to see
him?"
"A gentleman from Kieff," I replied
evasively. Â¦
The servant' disappeared, and a mo
ment later returned and showed me
into a small library. In a large leather
arm chair sat a feeble-looking, white-
haired man, with a bloodless face. He
rose to greet me, but he evidently did
not, recognize me. As I came close to
him, however,, he stretched out both
his hands, and a flood of cheer seemed
Â» to spread over his pallid countenance.
"Russakoff!" he cried.
/"Where have you kept yourself?" I
asked when the first gathering was
over, anxious for some reference to
Katia. "I searched with torches
through every country in Europe and
could not find a trace of you." .
"We stayed in Switzerland and
France most of the time," he answered
in a very weak voice, 'but I finally de
cided to end my days in this great land
of freedom."
"And Katia?" I asked with a throb
bing; heart.
"What an old rascal I am to keep
you from Katia!" he exclaimed, smil
ing broadly. . '
He summoned a servant. "Tell
Katia a gentleman from Kieff is here."
Then turning to me, he said with
the joy of a child playing a prank
upon another: "You hide yourself be
hind that curtain. Let me break the
news to her."
I secreted myself as he desired be
hind a curtain that hung in the door
way connecting the library with an
other room and waited her coming
with my eyes at the curtain's edge.
Presently she appeared. She was
dressed all in black. As I gazed at
her through eyes blinded with warm
tears I thought she looked like a
Queen in exile. She was the same
Katia â a trifle thinner, a trifle paler,
but even more sweetly beautiful than
when fate swept us apart several
years before.
"A gentleman from Kieff was here a
while ago," the Judge said in answer
to her questioning* glance about the
room. "He will be back soon. Guess
who he is!"
She shook her head, and, smiling
sadly, answered: "How can I guess,
father? We had so many friends in
Kieff."
"The gentleman," the old man con
tinued playfully, "told me he had met
Dr. Russakoff â he is a doctor now."
I clenched the curtain feverishly.
. She started, trembled, and her color
began to come and go.
"A â what â a -" she quavered.
"Come, my soul.' He slipped his
arm about her and drew her down
upon the arm of his chair. "What
would you give if I should bring him
here â at once?" he asked softly, mov
ing his weak eyes in the direction of
my concealment. x Â»
Katia caught her father around the
neck, and leaned her face against his
cheek. "Oh, father, don't trifle with
me! Do you know anything?"
"Would it not be great," he con
tinued, "if, as in Arabian tales, I could
produce him here by the mere men
tioning of his name? Let me raise
my wand and "
I could not stand this fairy tale
nonsense longer, and throwing the
curtain aside, I strode to the middle
of the room.
"Katia!" I cried.
â¢ She sprang to her feet and turned
a.bout. Judge Bailnick slipped out of
the room.
"Katia!" I cried again, the longing
of four years In my voice.
She opened her arms wide to me. "Is
rael! Oh, Israel!" she murmured, as I
clasped her to my breast.
, CHAPTER XIV.
THE END OF TWO LIVES.
The following few weeks Katia and
I were the happiest people In the world.
My college work was practically fin
ished, so I was free to be -.with her
morning, afternoon and evening, and
her presence made me forget all else.
During the period I had been away
from the tragic life of the East Side
I had begun to appreciate the spirit
of this country, and this appreciation
soon ripened to that love and admira
tion which surpass all native patriot
ism. I now cherished only one ideal â
to settle with my beloved Katia in a
purely American atmosphere. After a
great deal of discussion Detween our
selves and a . long consultation with
friends, we decided to locate in some
Southern town where there was promise
of my building up a lucrative practice.
And with this purpose in view I made
an extensive trip through the South
and discovered Just the place of our
desire.
On my return to New Tork I found
among the letters awaiting me the fol
lowing note in a nervous, scrawling
hand:
"Dear Doctor â¢ Russakoff: I am sick
in bed at B Hospital. I am mis
erable, wretched, and suffer beyond en
durance. I am afraid this will be my
end. Come as soon as you get this
note. I must tell you something se
rious. . . GAVNIACK."
The letter was dated several days
before. I wondered what might have
happened to him since then, and with
out flrs,t going to see my beloved Katia
I hastened to B Hospital. There I
â¢ was told that he had attempted to
.take his life, and before he recovered
from his illness he fell sick with ty
phoid fever complicated by pneu
monia, and that there was a slim
chance of his lasting through the
nisht.
I was ushered to a private room and
given a chair beside Gavniack's bed.
He lay stretched out on his back, his
mouth open, breathing heavily. The
low-burning light In the room added
grimness to the patient's emaciated
face and dark-bluish arteries on his
forehead. " .
There is such a close afflnitv between
human beings that, no matter how
much we hate one In good health, our
sympathies are aroused on finding him
on his death-bed. I had loathed this
man, but now, at sight of his slipping
Into eternity, I was moved to compas
sion.
He began to roll about restlessly
and to talk incoherently. Suddenly he
opened his eyes and fixed them glar
ingly upon me, and he gave utterance
to his raving in a flesh-creeping voice:
"Oh, Marthp.! Martha! Martha! look at
me â lookâ I did not murder your
father â did you not love me? â ah, that
Dolgoffâ he told \you everything â car
ried you awayâ oh, Dolgoff â my money
â everythingâ but give me backâMar
tha â look at her eyes, her milky
cheeks, herâ Marthaâ Mar "
He raved and talked in frightful
tones that made me stir ' in my seat.
Then he broke off and his raving took
another turn: "I felt it all the time-^
the very image of mother â (some in
distinct babbling here). Don't. Israeli
don't marry herâ there hangs our
fatherâ look how he stares at usâ those
eyes drive me crazyâ I killed himâ
Bialnick did itâ Blalnickâ oh, take that
cross awayâ ah, that cross, that â cross
âIsraelâ throw away that crossâfath
er is nailed to itâ ah, that crossâ that
cro â â "
His words became indistinct again,
then ceased. His breath was now com
ing with difficulty. I was damp with
sweat; my brain was whirling with
the tragedies of life.
Half an hour later he opened his eyes.
There was consciousness in ,them. A
tremor passed through his body and
Â¦with an effort he moved one emaciated
hand over the counterpane toward me.
"Isroelke," he murmured feebly.
. "Joseph," I answered, taking his
nand. My eyes began to overflow with
hot tears.
That was his only lucid moment. The
next instant his hand tightened con
vulsively upon mine and he began to
rave again.
"Don't you see fathr's face there â
nailed to the cross? The Christians
did itâ they crucified fatherâ they'll
crucify youâ Blalnick did itâ you'll not
marry herâ I am a villainâ I fooled
the whole world â everybody â every
bodyâbut I am a Jewâ you are a Jew
â once a Jew always â a Jew â don't
marry her " He struggled up on
one elbow, and stared wildly in front
of him. "Lookâ lookâ fatherâ mother
âon the cross â Shma â Isroelâ adenoi â
Eloâ heinuâ adenolchod-d-d- â "*
He fell back in my arms, gasping.
An hour later he lay motionless, quiet
â dead.
â¢ â¢ â¢
It was a little before daybreak when ,
I left the hospital. The scene I had
just witnessed stupefied my brain for a
while; then recollections of the remote
past began to come back to my mind
as I walked home, thinking and breath
ing deeply, with a vague hope of wak
ing and finding that I had only
dreamed. But I soon realized that I
had had no dream; my brother's cut
ting words still rang in my ears.
I opened my room quietly; I feared
my own- footsteps. A silvery glance of
the fading, vanishing moon fell upon
my desk. There lay the dog-eared
Bible. My thoughts again traveled to
my brother's delirious talk; I shud
dered at his suggestion. Gradually my
mind came back to Katia, and the aid
battle of creed and race and vengeance
raged in my breast. "Why did fate
bring us together?" I wondered why
I put myself this question. " Don't
marry herâ don't marry her." My
brother's words passed through my
mind. "The blood of your father's
murderer runs in her veins," a weird
voice seemed to whisper. And In
stantly a new feeling was sprouting
within me. That feeling of affinity
which binds the Jew to his race, to his
creed when all other hopes forsake
him, was waking in my heart. "Once
a Jew always a Jew." My brother's
words again haunted me.
I arose and walked across the room.
All around was dead silence; only at
intervals the clattering of the elevated
trains was heard, and then silence
again. I felt weary, and the burden of
life weighed heavily upon me. In a
moment the structure of my happiness
seemed to be razed to the ground and
buried me under its debris. My heart
was embittered, wretched, crushed.
Then I noticed on the floor a letter
â¢which had evidently been thrust under
my door after I had left for the hospi
tal. I picked it up with a fretful heart.
It was a note from Katia. She said
that her father was Cymg, and asked
me to come as soon as I reached
town. And forgetting all else, I hur
ried to my beloved.
When I knocked at Judge Blalnick's
apartment Katia herself opened the
door. "Bosje moi! papa is dying!" she
cried, and fell Into my arms.
"What's the matter with him, dear
est?" I asked.
"His heart. It's been weak for years,
you know."
"Has he been sick long?"
"He was quite well last night. But
a man came in to see papa last night.
Papa knew him in Kieff. He left a
letter which he said a friend in a hos
pital had asked him to deliver and then
went away. I was not in the room
when papa read the letter, but when
I came in a little later he was uncon
scious In his chair. The letter was
from a man who says he's your
brother. Do you think that would
have affected him so?"
I shook my head. I saw clearly the
hand that struck this blow.
Katia led me Into the chamber where
her father lay struggling for life. The
attending physician rose to leave. As
he was going out he whispered to me:
"His minutes are numbered. I have
been staying here for her sake."
A glance at the aged patient con
vinced me of the truth of the physi
cian's statement. He was unconscious,
his long, thin, silvery hair was scat
tered over the pillows: his face was
â¢wan and calm and his breath came
fast and short. Katia fell on her knees
at his bedside, took one of his hands in
both hers and sobbed brokenly.
Shortly after daybreak the patient
opened his, eyes and turned them to
ward me. I leaned over the bed and
felt his pulse. His eyes opened, closed,
and opened again. Something like a
shudder passed over his wrinkled coun
tenance: his wrist trembled in my
hand. He glanced from me to Katia
and stirred as if he wished to rise and
utter something. A flush of scarlet
tinged his bloodless cheeks as he
glanced at me. He stirred again. His
arm trembled, his whole body quivered,
a gleam like that of sunshine lightened
his deadly looking eyes. With a sudden
effort, half rising, he clasped my hand
and placing it upon Katla's he gasped:
"Israel â forgive!" #
Our hands remained clasped together
long after he had drawn his last breath.
Katia, with her face down, did not
- Â»Hear, (3 Israel! God is our Lord-
God is one.
peem to realize that the end had come.
I sat motionless, fearing to arouse her.
Suddenly something like an electric
shock passed through my mind. It
only lasted a few seconds, but in that
brief space of time my whole life flit
ted through my mind. The tragedy of
the two lives that had passed away on
this night added color to my mystic
Imagination. The last words of my
brother rang clamorously In my ears;
the terrible episodes of my life stood
out vividly before my mind's eye; many
fragments of recollections came in a
common floodâ the lives of Blalnick and
Joseph stood before me side by side
â and in them I saw the weak
ness, the mortality, the littleness
of man. The errors of these men
seemed to me like links of a great
chain â the endless chain- of faith, of
nature, of God. All history unrolled
itself before me, and it. too, was a part
of that great ch'ain. Then like a flash
of lightning a revelation flashed upon
me â the revelation of my people, the
revelation of my father and of his
fathe'r, and the revelation of my own
life.
' This revelation came to me almost as
a dream, as a vision; it Interpreted to
me the mystery of my people. Side by
side the life of the crucified and the life
of rfy race among nations and" the life
of my father and my own strange life â
in a vision they all presented them
selves before me. And this vision, this
revelation, showed me the symbolism
of my race, the symbolism of the
Christ. It showed me that the crucified
was the symbol of his people, as my
father was of his generation and as I
am of mine. It showed me that not the
Pilgrims, not the Crusaders, not the
followers of him whom they called Sa
vior â none but the fugitive race are the
eternal bearers of the cross.
The next instant, when this mystic
vision had vanished. I became con
scious of the clasp of Katla's hand, I
beheld her pure soul in the Innocent
look of her luminous eyes, and again
the past flashed through my mind with
lightning rapidity. But the past now
revealed to me a different symbol â the
symbolism of the. Innocent blood â the
symbolism of Katia's life and mine.
"Katia," I whispered softly, glancing
at the corpse before us, "let the dead
past bury the dead. We are the inno
cent blood."
She gazed at me meanlnglessly; she
knew nothing of the tragedy of her
father's lifeâ she was Innocent.
CHAPTER XV.
THE LAST GLIMPSE.
Before turning over the last leaf of
my history I read over this narrative,
and I have been struck with its bro
kenness, its lack of order, its coinci
dences. At first I thought this was a
fault in my narrative, but after a little
scrutiny I know it is a fault in life:
for life is not a logical procession of
events, as novelists present it. It is
sometimes, broken, incoherent, and at
other times chance makes events fit,
coincide. In real life people come and
go; acquaintances meet and separate;
the friends of to-day are not seen to
morrow. In this record of my experi
ences friends have appeared only to
disappear. Such is life.
Peitiaps during their brief stay in
these pages my friends have aroused
enough interest to warrant at least a
few words concerning their after life.
My friends, like myself, fugitives
from the land of bondage, now enjoy
the liberty of our glorious country;
they, too. have thriven in the great
land of freedom. In place of the "sweat
shop" has arisen the prosperous cloth
ing factory of Levando & Son, who are
of the most prominent in one of the
Western States. The father's hair has
turned gray, but there is still the twin
kle of hopeful youth in his bluish eyes;
and even Gittele smiles when her hus
band sings the praises of the stars and
stripes. Daniel has become a well
known lawyer, and chiefly through
him Mark Fetter was forced into bank
ruptcy a few years ago. Dolgoff mar
ried Martha, and this change in his life
has developed a certain amount of sta
bility in his character; he is now at the
head of a branch of a life Insurance
company in Chicago. As for Ephraim
Razovski, If you are a reader of popu
lar magazines you have undoubtedly
noticed many articles and short stories
bearing his nameâ all characteristic of
his restless, fiery spirit. And Malkeâ
she is a happy mother In a large and
happy family, and her last child was
named Nathan, after her father, who
had died a year before.
Now for a few last words about my
self. Since my life has been united with
that of my beloved Katia nothing has
occurred to mar our happy existence.
I have been successful in my profes
sion, and also in gaining the respect
and friendship of my good American
neighbors. We live in harmony with
God and man. â¢
I still have my literary aspirations,
and still frequently scribble verses,
which my sweet Katia values as high
ly as those of Pushkin and of Lermon
toff. But she is a biased critic; and to
judge from public recognition my ef
forts have .been attended with only
meager success. S,
Not Infrequently, however, a bit of
cloud darkens the sky of my happi
ness. Recollections of the bitter past/
recur to my mind; the groans of my '
peonle from tyrannical Russia, from I
Morocco, from France, occasionally
reach my. ears. Then I suffer with the
down-trodden race as if I still lived
among them In some barricaded
Ghetto.
The other day my eldest son, whose
seventh birthday we soon hope to cele
brate, came crying Into the house be
cause the boy of a neighbor called him
Jew. Katia adjusted his cap and
said: "Hush, sweetheart. You must
not quarrel with Robert." "But he
calls me a Jew even if I don't quarrel
â¢with him," the innocent little martyr
Justified hlm3elf. ',
When the child was out of the room
Katia turned to me with a sorrowful
look. As our eyes met one common
thought flitted through our brains. I
bowed my head in pain. Pretending
not to be hurt by the injustice our boy
had suffered, she came uÂ»p to me, and,
throwing her arm around me, whis
pered In a very low. consoling tone:
"Israel, what troubles you?"
I pressed her to ray breast, and
pushing back her luxuriant hair from
her forehead I Impressed a kiss upon
her brow and answered: 'â¢The cross,
my love â the cross I bear weighs
heavily upon me." â¢ ;<' -
She divined my thought, and with
tears gathering in her beautiful eyes
locked my neck in a tight embrace,
and putting her cheek against mine,
muttered: "Father, forgive them, for
they know not what they do."
(THE END)'THERE is a charm about Maeter
linck the essayist, as about Mae
terlinck the dramatist, which de
fies exact definition. It is the
spirit in his writings; yes. It Is also
an atmosphere, a fine literary delicacy
of thought and Imagery which breathes
from the pages of his works something
felt, not seen. There are some who find
in -the refined essence of the Belgian's
thought a trace of the "precleux," of
the finical even, In what seems to them
strained affectation. Perhaps they
may with some Justice hang this ob
jection upon some of the Intricacies of
Maeterlinck's plays, but In the sober
reading of his essays no such charge
can be advanced. "The Double Gar

the beauties ? of nature, must ; only
strengthen the faith of all devoted
Maeterlincklansâ if that generic desig

must add many to the fold of the faith

its very simplicity. In recording the
manner in which th< sturdy little
"Dago chiid" won his /way into the
heart of: Mrs. Clocked and brought

Churchill's novels, bullded on histor
ical bases, are inextricably woven with
the -background of fact so that both
move toward the denouement as one.
The history is the story. In "Richard
Carvel" this was evidenced; "The
Crisis" abided by the same standard;
"The Crossing," Churchill's last ro
mance upon an epoch in American his
tory, accentuates this feature to a
greater degree than did the other two.
To abide by the facts of history closely,
to read into its significance all that
therein resides and from this to call
imagination into play for the rounding
and finishing of what Is in itself strik
ing romance â this Is to t>e rarely con
scientious In the production of the his
torical novel.
But right here let an exception to
the grand scheme of "The Crossing"
be .taken. There is too much of It.
In seeking to turn to the uses of fiction
the great elemental manifestations
born of a phenomenon of history that
had its action over the whole heart of
a continent the author has allowed his
faithfulness to history to carry him
beyond the bounds %t artistic propriety.
The great movement of the peoples
that resulted in the upbuilding of an
empire In the Mississippi Valley is a
theme large enough for a trilogy of
romances, but cannot be pressed into
the limits of one volume, even though
that volume be a large one, without a
sacrifice to the standards of story
writing. Had Churchill confined "The
Crossing" to the heroic epic of Ken

had material enough for the novel;

#1 and one distinctive for its bold
jT\ excursion without the frontier of
f every-day fiction is Margaret
Horton Potter's "The Flame Gatherers."
From the very fact that it delves deep
ly ir.to the hidden depths of Oriental
mysticism and philosophic conjecture,
Misa Potter's storv clothes itself. with
the charm of novelty. Its strength
lies in the vivid portrayal of a story,
dramatic as it is "unhackneyed, and in

The underlying motif of Miss Pot

soulsâ not a new theme in fiction, to
be sure, but treated in "The Flame
Gatherers" in an entirely untried fash
ion. In handling this delicate pfln
ciple, made all the more dangerous by
the pretensions and the mummery of

has approached her. task from the un
reserved standpoint of Hindoo â¢ faith.
So well has she thrown herself Into
the mystic speculation of the Oriental
philosophies that the development of
her plot with its hinge on soul trans
ference seems to come as from an In
dian mind itself. There is nothing oc
cldentaj, nothing that seems to come
of forced endeavor after a new thought.
Reading "The Flame Gatherers" one is
.made to feel the reality of it all; at the
end of the book the question arises
naturally In the reader's mind : "Re
incarnationâ well, why not?"
But this underlying current of 'the
story does not begin to be made mani
fest until the end is nearly reached.
The first half of the book is occupied

however, the author makes partial

itself, to support Itself entirely upon
its qwn breatlT "To-day the universe

Until now we had been prosing with
the aid of our infirm logic on our idle
Investigation on the subject of the rid
dle; to-day issuing from our too inward
abode, we are trying to enter 'into re
lations with the riddle itself."
From ,.this the author ' makes the
deduction that, living in a universe
daily becoming more tangible, and con
sequently more broad, our morality
must of a surety, broaden 5 with the
horizon. "If our happiness," says he,
"depends upon our conception of the
universe, that is, in a great . measure,
because our morality depends upon it.
And our morality depends much less
upon the nature than upon the size of
the conception. We should be better,
nobler, more moral in the midst of a
universe proved to, be without morality,
but conceived on an Infinite scale; than
In a universe which attained the per
fection of the human Ideal, but which
appeared to us circumscribed and de
void of mystery."
Quite of the same spirit of daring op
timism Is the author's essay on* "Sin
cerity," wherein he takes the very
broad ground that are we but sincere
with ourselves in recognizing In our
own vices, faults and passions things
that constitute our primitive vital force
and are Instinctive -in us, we may take
the high vantage ground of an Interest

very human fallings.' This faculty, of
observation must in Itself coma only
after we have attained a' force of in
tellect sufficiently powerful; with the
possession of that rarefied degree of In
telligence we can control these' vagrant
creatures of our lower nature at will.
A rather fanciful conception Is] this of
Maeterlinck's and one not calculated
to receive ready reception at the hands
of our moralists.
In lighter vein Maeterlinck returns
from a score of magazines, should be
called "The Double Garden" is as dark
a mystery as the most erudite Brown
ing "interpreter could crave. Perhaps
the craze that. has overtaken the Eng
lish magazine world for naming publi

ten his last volume with. a name whose
significance is known only to hhnsel*.
However that may be, and whether
this is a "Double Garden" or a- "Single

The ' one richest ' in thought ; and
filled with the highest optimism for
us of the present moment Is that en
titled "The Leaf of Olive." It is r.- hlng
loss than the spiritual welfare of the
human race which Maeterlinck under
takes to instruct in the present essay.
What is the result for us of the human
family that in this enlightened age we
are enabled to read; the world through
the eyes of science rather than through
thÂ» clouded glasses of philosophic and
religious speculation? If we have left
behind us a cycle of intense religious
enthusiasm and are .advancing Into an
age of coldly critical, skeptically inves
tigating materialism, is there taken
from us all morality, all spirituality?
Are we becc-me soulless mites resi

says Maeterlinck. We who cling not so
tenaciously to the spiritual have j to
support us now the constant presence

By far the rnost interesting part of
the tale â and it is all interesting if con
sidered by lengths and sections â is that

Here Churchill gives us the high he
roic measures of the primitive fight for
existence. David Ritchie, a remarkably
resourceful lad and possessed of more
than the family modicum of intelli
gence, is left to face the world upon
the death of his father, and soon as
sorts his independence by running
away from his wealthy relatives in
Charleston to join fortunes with the
westward moving wood rangers. With
Tom McChesney, a backwoodsman, and
his hale wife, Polly Ann, young David
crosses the gap and helps to set stakes
among the first comers in "the dark
and bloody ground." Churchill's narra
tive is here thrilling with action. George
Rogers Clark, the man who won the
Middle West for the struggling colo
nies, playc the leading role. Under him
Davy marches against Kaskaskia and
Vincennes, sees Hamilton, the British
"hair-buyer," driven out of the Ohio
Valley and the stemming tide of Indian
hordes turned back. If only the rest
of the book were as full of incident and
big with the significance of movement
as this eoitome of the winning of-Ken
tucky the whole would be truly a mon
umental achievement. But the subse
quent experiences of David Ritchie, the
young lawyer, at St. Louis and New
Orleans during the period of the Gen
eral Wilkinson treasons are colorless in
contrast. . "~
One feature of particular Interest in
"The Crossing" is the picture of George
Rogers Clark. As there have been at
tempts, both in history and fiction, to
rub the tarnish off the characters of
Benedict Arnold and Aaron Burr, so
Churchill elevates this man, whose
later years were crowned with dis
grace, by the eulogy paid him in his
narrative. Extolling his achievements
in the crucial years of Kentucky's in
fancy and condoning his subsequent
lapses from grace on the score of a re
public's ingratitude and the treachery
of 'strong driiik, the author makes of
Clark a {jallanr figure, though a tragic
one.
As a postscript we might express the
wish that should Mr. Churchill contem
plate an epic of the "spread-eagle" pe
riod in our historyâ logically the next
to be exploitedâ he will produce the
same in a trilogy at least. It is certain
that he lacks not the power to do so.
It would be unfortunate were he to
produce another crowded novel like

to his favorite subjects â the flowers,
the bees, dogs and their attributes of
intelligence and loving kindness. "The
Wrath of the Bee" dwells upon the
seeming anomalies in the social order
of the honey gatherers. ' "News' of
Spring," "Field Flowers," "Chrysan
themums"âthese reflect the poetry in
the soui of the essayist. "Our Friend,
the Dog," is delightfully, humorous in
the peculiarly doggy essence given \ to
fts philosophy by -the author's view of
the world through Â¦ the eyes of that
faithful beastâ the "one animal alone,
among all that breathe3 upon -the earth,
who has succeeded in breaking through
the prophetic circle. In escaping from
itself to come bounding toward us, def
initely to cross the enormous: zone of
darkness, ice and silence that Isolates

This volume must not be laid aside:
without a word of tribute to M. Tel

that, like all translations ' from that

the delicate shades of meaning are lost
in our heavier English words, it is to
the high credit of M. de Mattos thaj the
text he has given us is musical, smooth
flowing and bright with much of the
fine distinction of phraseology that the
original must possess.

For finale he gives us chapters on the
immortality of the soul and the exist

he makes doubly interesting by briefly

and then linking it in his chain of
reasoning on the alternate sex. So he
does these 'two last climacteric chap
ters, giving us his peculiar personal
reasons for faith, and his acceptance
of what his experience pointed out to
him as truth â he himself thinks he lias

subliminal, feminine soul within. "Be

Now, as for the foundation of fact
which he lays for his speculative su
perstructure, it is synoptically some
what thus: There is for every differing
physical form a corresponding men
tality, as we note th*e womanly form'
h&s the feminine mental characteris
tics to match, and so of the man. In
the variations more or less marked
from the distinct sexual types, as in
the woman who approaches man In her
physical appearance â tenser muscles
and rougher build and sterner face and
harder voice â we find along with it
more of the mind, the will, the tastes
and pursuits of a man. So if the man
Is phy6lcally divergent from full manly
type toward the feminine, his mind will
correspond to It- But there are In all
normal men and women certain physi
cal rudiments which belong, in their
full development, exclusively to the
other eex. These almoBt eeem evidenc
ing: a distant epicene ancestry. So the
most maaljr men and the most woman
ly women have mingled In their mental
make-up much of the characteristics
of the opposite sex.. : r.^Jj
Next Leland makes us consider the
now generally accepted working hy
pothesis that we have another self"
within us, sometimes called the sub
liminal, or subconscious self. In his
study of this Inner Me he finds that in
man it has all the peculiar character
istics which prove It undoubtedly femi
nine in Its nature; and from what
women have endeavored to explain to
.Mm he thinks their subliminal self is
masculine.
Having investigated the result of his
conviction of the truth of this theory.
he proceeds to point out the uses of
It. and the further use of all of us
knowing it so that we may consciously
enjoy and get good working results
from it. So there are chapters on dreams
and hypnotism, and imagination, and
entering into harmony, and mutual in
fluence, which are fine, not merely as
poetic fancy, but as ways and means of
jitilizirig our alternate sex. Over It all
plays the dancing light of genius' lais

who has studied lovingly fairy lore arfd

He assumes that the elusive mystery
which we have long vaguely known
and studied as the subliminal self, the
inner me, the hidden soul, uncon

alternate sex within us. In the case of
a man it is a woman mind and spirit

chambers of his soul, complementing

time. All gathered together under the
trees and it was like one big family for
fun and frolic and good will. There
were games of leap frog among the
rabbit boys, and so much pleasure
seemed to be derived from it that even
the rabbit papas threw aside their dig

AT THE
SNAKE ROCK MINE
But once outside she wondered if sho
had done the best she could. He was
down in the mine working fiercely with
his men at the almost pure vein which
the explosives had uncovered, and be
lieving that she would return with tha
new lease. Only ten more days, and ha
did not know it. What could she do?
Before she had gone a hundred yards
she knew, and Instead of keeping on
toward tiie stores, she hurried to tha
only printing office Bedrock contained.
An hour later tha town was conspicu
ously posted with: "Men wanted at tha
Snake-Rock mine for ten days. Wagea
$15 a day, pack mules $10."
Ordinary wages for good laborer*
was $1 or 15. Bosses and superintend
ents dld-not average Jla. In an hour
men were leaving regular Jobs of work
and ruthlessly breaking contracts.
When Joyce finished her shopping and
started for home she found straggler a
and groups with picks and . shovels
scattered along the trail for two miles
or more. But she reached the mouth of
the mine first and sent an imperative
summons for Temple to come to tha
surface. When he Joined her a half
hour later, twenty men were waiting:
for Jobs, with fifty hurrying up tha
slope.' and between the fifty and Bed
rock came half a thousand more.
. The regular force of the mine, was
less than a hundred men. but the next
morning a thousand names were en
the payroll, divided into day and
night shifts. A great stream of ora
rolled up out of the mine to the backs
of the pack mules and on the smelter
at Bedrock, whence 'came certifi
cates of credit with figures that would
have staggered a mine-owner of mod
erate Ideas. But Temple did not even
see them. He was down in tha mine,
working and watching day and night
to see that the great stream should
not slacken for even an Instant. '
Joyce insisted on a share in tha
work and remained at the mouth of
the mine with book and pencil, keep
ing a record of the stream as It flowed
past, and it waa she who took charge
of the credit slips as they came in.
So a week went by, eight days, nina
days, and the tenth was nearing- its
close when Temple. came up from tha
mine and staggered weakly to where
Joyce was standing with her book and
pencil. And behind Temple came the
half thousand men of the day shift.
slipping through the mouth of the
mine like the colls of a mighty ser
pent. The vein had again disappeared,
and four hour's of lease remained.
â¢ When Temple looked over the credit
slips the weariness left his face.. "I
knew it would be something stu
pendous," he said to Joyce with a long
breath, "but nothing like this. We
will divide two hundred thousand of
It among the workmenâ less than one
quarterâand then for the East."
(Copyright. 1904. by Frank H. Sweet.)
"As Temple has rediscovered tha
vein, richer than ever," finished Graw
coolly, "we propose to operate It our
selves. But you may ten him that if
he will turn the mine over to us at day
light to-morrow we will pay him back
one-half the year's lease â twenty-flva
thousand."
"Arid let him lose the other seventy
five thousand," flashed back Joyce.
"No, thank you. We will hold the mine
until the very last moment of thÂ«
lease."
made a fortune out of the mins and
then when you lost the vein you
leased It to Mr. Temple through mis
representations. He paid you fifty
thousand, and has sunk more thÂ»n
fifty thousand In searching for that
vein. Until day before yesterday,
from nearly a year's work, ha took,
out less than $1000. He told me that
you were up there yourselves only a
short time ago trying to induce him to
re-lease the mine for twenty-five thou
sand, believing it to be exhausted.
Now "
Joyce lost some of her color. What
little money, she and her aunt had waa
Invested In the mine, as well as Hugh
Temple's, and the lease ran out in ten
days..
"Well,", she said slowly.. "I am au
thorized, in case you should decline
to recognize your offer, to raise the
amount to what was pald^last year â
fifty thousand."
"Which we. must decline," said
Graw suavely, "with real regret, you
understand. And I will add that we
would decline a hundred thousand just
as promptly."
"You mean that you will not're
lease'the Snake' Rock mine on any
terms?" the girl's white lips asked.
"Exactly. We . expect to resume
operations there ourselves."
"I understand you have heard. And
I suppose you call this business. You
"That offer was made four weeks
ago," he said, "and Temple declined it."
; "You mean you will not renew It
for that?"
"Exactly."
"I wish to see you about the Snake-
Rock mine lease," Joyce began gra
ciously.
Gregg bowed, but not before the
visitor lmagin * she saw a swift
glance flash between the partners.
"I understand it expires in ten
days," said Gregg blandly. "You are
Miss Killian?"
"Yes. We â Mr. Temple wishes to
renew the lease on the terms you pro
posed."
"Visiting at Snake-Rock Camp with
your aunt," went on Gregg. "You see
we've all heard â or guessed. Whenâ er
âis the Interesting event to come off,
if you don't mind?"
"If you are alluding to my mar
riage with Mr.' Temple, It has not yet
been announced," answered Joyce
coldly. "But about the lease. Will
you kindly make it out as soon as pos
sible? I have some shopping to do In
town, and It Is a long ride back to
camp. Mr. Temple will sign the pa
pers and return them at once. There
are only ten days and he wishes to
.have the matter arranged without de
lay."
"Why didn't he come down him
self?" demanded Graw bluntly.
"He Is very busy at the mine and
I convinced him that I could attend to
It Just as well," Joyce answered. "He
said It was to be made out at twenty
five thousand and â your own offer."
Graw laughed aloud.
When she left the canyon she struck
a more level country, and here the mus
tang was let out to its full speed. Bed
rock was still ten miles away, and she
must reach it and be back to the mine
before night. It was already well on
toward noon.
Bedrock was a one - street town
which commenced and ended In tents,
with a few unpair.ted frame buildings
in the center. It was an hour after
noon when Joyce slipped from her
horse in front of the office of Gregg
& Graw, mine brokers and operators.
Both of the proprietors were in, and
both rose at her entrance. Young
ladies of Joyce's type were not yet
common at Bedrock.
y-^OYCE KIL.LJAN was only two
I weeks from a select boarding
\ school in the East, where the
QJ young ladles were zealously
buarded from all contact with the
rough outside world. Yet this morn
ing she was tearing down Snake-Rock
Canyon upon a mustang, not three
months from a bronco, buster, with
gaudy, cumbersome horse trappings
that had been brought up from Mexico
more as a curiosity than for use.
But. there was no fear nor self
consclousness In her face, and instead
of trying to check the mustang her
hand went out from time to time to
stroke and pat its neck encouragingly,
as her voice urged it on.

THE FOURTH
OF JULY IN BUNNYVILLE

own room is a great .fad. The board
ing-house keeper and the proprietor
do not like it, but what can the poor
girl do when Â¦ there is no laundry
handy, or when prices are ruinous!
It is a fad to give a laundry party.
All the other boarders are invited in
your room while you slap out your One
, laces, wash your organdies and lawns
and doÂ»a little lace handkerchief iron
ing on the looking-glass and window
pane. < There is many a dollar saved
this way, so it is a very useful fad.
The monogram fad is not new, but
, it is more the fad than ever. You can
get a .belt buckle which is made of
your monogram and nothing else. You
can put a big monogram on the back
of your gloves. You can stamp your
â¢bag: with a monogram. You can em
broider one on' your instep. You can
put a monogram upon the breast of
your shirt waist or upon your right
sleeve. And you > can monogram your
. sash I end and goodness knows what
not. It is a very pretty fad and one
that affords work for busy fingers all
summer, for the making of mono-'
grams there is no end.
' And, among the fads, there Is the
patch. Do you know how to make a
patch, and how to put it on and how
to wear it? It is the thing to cut it
out in fancy shape and wear it next to
one's best feature. If you have &
dimple by all means Â¦ put the patch
next to It. If your chin be cleft then
let the patch adorn your chin to show
its, pretty curve. If your forehead be
Upon, the outside there are stubby lit
tle trees and Russian wolves and low
houses. There are square silk purses
and hand bags that are wonders In
handsome French brocade; and there
are bags of 1830, made from the attic.
It is a fad to have a great many of
them and to carry as many as possible,
one at a time, but changing often.
And the New York girl has other
fads, and one og these is very inex
pensive. It is the fad for laundry
work. Don't put out. your fine laun
dry if you want to follow this fad. Do
it yourself. . In one of her summer
trunks the girl of Gotham takes a
miniature laundry outfit. Everything
is dolls' size, but very useful Just the
same. .
There Is the tiny washboard. There
is the little bit of a washboard, no big
ger than a little girl would need for
her doll clothes. There Is'the little
box of fine starch and the salt to make
it smooth and glossy. There are the'
tiny clothespins and there is the -blu
ing and there the dyes. Fine washing
nowadays includes the J knowledge of
ecru tints, cream and blue and gray.. .
For ironing purposes the Gotham
girl takes with her a little charcoal
iron. You build a fire in it and it
stays hot all through the ironing. It
is the neatest, safest thing, that ever
was and the summer girl who owns
such an iron is quite independent of
gas and electricity, of stoves and un
certain heat. . Â¦ Â»
Washing one'a own clothes Interne's
pleasant aroma, a highly scented at
mosphere, which will add a thousand
per cent to the delights of smoking.
The Gotham girl has one more fad
which might not be called Just the
thing. She burns Chinese incense
and sits in front of the long smolder-
Ing sticks â smoking! She takes long
whiffs of cigarette smoke and blows
the smoke in the air while the Chinese
sticks send forth their incense behind
her head.
She makes a lovely picture seated
thus and one that will not be forgot
ten. But is it right to smoke? Is It
right to burn incense and sit in front
of it as though you were" the daughter
of a mandarin? These are questions
to be pondered.
The girl of Gotham has plans laid
ahead for August. She is going to go
barefoot. Yet not quite barefoot, for
Fhe will wear sandals. If you want
to know how she will look Just get a
pair of child's sandalsâ the sort the
children of London wear in the sum
mer time. There are, if you will re
call, soles that are Ions and wide and
flat. Then comes a strip of leather
â¢which passes up between the toes.
There is a strap at the back, making
a sort of little harness, and there are
straps across the Instep. This makes
the sandal strong and complete. The
girl of Gotham wears this and goes
almost barefooted. It |s pretty and It
is healthful, and, now, since she does
not pinch her toes, it is becoming.
Making zandals is one of the Gotham
pirl's fads. She cuts them-' out o(
leather, has the straps- arranged at the
harness shop, and so is enabled to have
sandals of every kind and every color.
She needs nothing but the leather with
which to work. The rest she. can man
age for herself. She knows how to
make them.
There Is another fad. and this is a
pretty one. It costs real money, but
it is refined and esthetic. To have such
a fad one must either be rich or have
rich friends; for the fad Is nothing
less than the collecting of purses.
To gratify this fad one must have - a
purse from all over the world. There
Is a quaint purse, all gold threads,
And the way to do it is this: Take
a little nice perfume and pour it into
the palm of your hand. Select your
cigarette, roll it around in your hand
until the perfume is all soaked up and
the cigarette is dampened. Then lay
it aside to dry. As soon as the paper
Is crisp again light the cigarette and
smoke it. The result will be a very
Then the Gotham srlrl has a fad for
animals of the Jungle. She calls them
jungleheads. She never goes without
carrying one with her. She carries a
Junglthead upon the handle of her par
asol. And she has it arranged so that
Kh*Â« can unscrew it and screw another
one on in Its place. She owns half a
dozen of these heads, tigers, panthers,
â¢wild cats t and angora?, and she pos
sesses a wolf's head, a fox head and
the heaC of a wild boar. She never
stirs unless protected by one of these.
The more animals she can carry
about with h<*.* the better. This is
the opinion of the girl of Gotham. She
wears a silver head at her belt, the
head of an animal; ehe carries a
carved cat upon her parasol handle; in
her pocket there reposes a carved ivory
*lephant; at her throat there is a tiny
black dog; her shirt waist set is in
the shape of animal heads; and. upon
her bag. there is fastened a silver or
nament which resembles an animal of
Junsleland. Truly she does not move
about unprotected.
And the girl of Gotham has some
fads which are not quite so harmless,
torse naughty fads. And one of these
Is the fad of the scented cigarette. She
takes paper cigarettes and rolls them
in perfume until the paper is satur
ated.
The New York girl has another fad.
The loves skulls. She carries a tiny
<jne upon her watch fob "for luck" and
for ornament; and ehe hangs a skull of
j>apier mache. if she cannot get the
real article, over her dressing table.
Fhe arranges a row of skulls along the
walls of her library, innocent looking
tkulLs that make you think they are
:nsde of plaster of Paris; and she hangs
ii-tkull In her dining-room. It Is Just a
fad. ehe will tell you. But a very vig
orous on*Â» Just now.
The guests arrive. Each tells his or
her ihvme. Each writes it in the Llm
rrick book. And that makes the enter
tainment. It is a great fad in Gotham.
The funnier the Limericks the better.
Then the girl cf Gotham has other
tntertaininent fads. She gives a Lim
trick party? Do you k&n v what a
Uir.fciick party is? Invite a dozen
y/^ceta and tell them all to come pre
l.aied with a rhyme. Then get a blank
UÂ«jk. Write -Limericks" on the out
tide. Ard on the flrst page Inscribe
jour own rhyme.

tin! her hair is done low. in girlish
fiishlon, with a bow cf ribbon at the
i.ack.
The girl of Gotham has a fad for en
tertaining in new ways. Some of these
ways are rather unconventional. The
bachelor girl gives little dressing
tucque parties. Her guests come in
fchut waists and separate skirts, but
ih"s bachelor eirl wears a dressing
m-i.ut and silk petticoat. This sounds
uCO. But. reallj', the dressing Bacque is
a marvel In mils and is made of the
r.nttt lawn and needlework and the
i-iiic r*tticoat is a. wonderful thing in
i utilts and lace. It can cost anything
ljj to $50. Of course with the silk pet
ticoat the bachelor girl wears a be-
also, a hlg. fiat bean. It looks like a
horse chestnut, but Li flatter, and on
the outiide is carved her sism of the
zodiac Ta.ke vour month and carve
iÂ«* eisrn uoon the outside of a horse

lucky Etone of 1904. Don't be wltfc-out
a sapphire any longer. Get one and
never lay it aside. Wear it or carry
it all the time.
The g-irl of Gotham carries around
with her a email satchel. This con
tains her mascots. She has bo many
of ih*:n that they trill not all so in
her T.ixket, nor can tiiey all be strung
upon a chain. She must have a whole
satchel devoted to them and she packs
then away as 3he would pack her
v.'^rdrobe.
And here are some of her mascots:
She carries a Jur.jjle elephant. An
elephant is the lucky animal of certain
hot countries, and the Gotham girl i3
wjperstitiotis. She carrie3 always with
her a little carved white elephant, and
to him she oilers her prayers for a
lucky day.
Then, in the satchel, there goes.
DO you know th* nw fads of the
girl o! Gotham?
You are clever if you keep
track of them all and you ar*
dull if ycu do not admire them.
For. however si'Hy they may be. how
ever far-fetched and feminine, they
iire certainly Interesting, and many of
them are clever.
*T APPY that hostess who, on the
I A glorious Fourth, can boast a
I I porch, either in town, or
J country. If ever^ there is a
day when all the world and his
v ife wants to go a-eummcrlng it is
Independence day; and never are
pvests so easily pleased as then.
On her porch, therefore, the hostess
concentrates her energies and her pret
tiest thins*. From the front porch the
women folk will watch the men renew
th'lr youth in ball and tennis. In a
secluded corner of the same porch the
table should be set forth, and again at
right the guests will move to the front
nips to watch the fireworks. The
lioKtess may. therefore, feel safe In
despoiling her living room of Its easiest
chairs, softest cushions and prettiest
tea table, the latter for ' the punch
bowl and glasses.
Decorations of crepe paper,. paper
lanterns or bunting should be used on
the porch. At the favor counters of
the department stores a bewildering
variety of queer Chinese' balls, fans and
rings strung together for garnishing
porches can be purchased. These are
all made from folded papers and are
easy to carry to the summer home.
They come In the national colors, as
do the lanterns. Nor should the host
forget to have "Old Glory" run up on
a pole on the cupola or fluttering from
an upper window.
If the dinner table is set on the porch
screw a big hook in the ceiling directly
above the center, of \. the table.
Make this the center for streamers of
red, white and blue bunting or crepe
paper, which can be run out to the'
four corners of the ceiling overhead or
draped to hang above the table like a
canopy. For the center piece on the
table : use a cut glass dish filled with '
popples, bachelor buttons or larkspur
and daisies; or marguerites, which will
give the 'national colors in bloom, r
'A Western ; hostess ' evolved the idea,
of a centerpiece made from as many
eilken flags as she had guests. These
were stuck into a mound of soft moss
and connected by red, white and blue
ribbons with the plates.* Surrounding
this mound of flags was a circle of thir- '
teen guns, tiny, brass cannon, each
holding a small firecracker, the small
est size she could get. When the guests
were seated the hostess touched off the
firecrackers with a lighted taper, and
the meal opened with a salute of thir
teen guns, to the flag. When the meal
was over each ribbon. was pulled by a
guest, who drew out a silk flag as a
souvenir.
If, the hostess is a city woman 'she
need not despair. If she has a balcony
overlooking the back yard â and ttie
decoration of the back yard is a mat
ter-of pride with most women who
stay in town during the hot weather
she can serve the dinner or supper to
half a dozen guests or more by using
small tables. If the porch is not avail
able, then she. makes her dining-room
as light and airy as possible and serves
her dinner early, before lights are nec
essary. A music box sending forth pa
triotic airs is a pleasant accompani
ment.
A heavy dinner menu is not appro
priate for the evening meal on this hol
iday, when all the world grows young
again.' Something 'on the line of an
old-fashioned six o'clock tea or supper
tastes infinitely better to jaded city ap
petites or healthy country ones..
Here is an excellent -menu for a six
o'clock supper on the glorious Fourth,
and it gives the touch of color which is
quite essential to service on that day:
Raspberry Cocktail.
Creamed Fish in Forget-Me-Not
Ramekin Cases. " ..
Olives in an Ice Tub.
Broiled Chicken. . Creamed Potatoes.
Cherrv Salad. . . Crackers.
, Frozen Strawberries with Whipped

Raspberry cocktail calls for dead
ripe fruit. A dozen berries; are washed
and heaped in a glass, with the Juice
of an â¢ orange poured .* over them and
allowed. to stand for a while. Then, at
serving time, a heaping teaspoonful
of powdered sugar and a tablespoon
ful of finely chopped Ice Is added,
giving a fine appetizer for. hot weather.
The forget-me-not ramekin cases
are of paper in delicate. blue, with arti
ficial flowers outlining : the edge.
The ice tub is; formed by melting a
small cake of ; ice 'into the "desired
shape by the application of cloths
dipped into hot water, or a warm Iron
wrapped round with a clean cloth.. The
object is to get a crystal tub. hollow
in the center, to hold olives. It is set
in a nest of fern, leaves.
Cherry salad consists of rich ox
heart cherries, stoned and served on
lettuce leaves, with delicate French
dressing.
When the hostess has a house party
on her hands, whose members do not
incline Joward athletic sports, it is
well -to have some game or guessing
contest to suggest when â¢ Interest , In
fireworks wanes, . especially if the af
ternoon is passed on a shaded porch.
Here are two games which will test
the patriotic knowledge of the average
gathering and find it sadly wanting.
The hostess prepares typewritten
copies of the preamble to the Declara
tion of Independence, omitting Â¦ every
fourth word, and the guests are asked
to fill In the blanks with the correct
words. : This is the way the test is ar
ranged:

The Gotham girl has a fad for mix
in* drinks this summer. This may
not be as harmful as it sounds. Many
of her drinks arÂ« made of fruit Juices,
cunningly mjngled in 'a vegetarian
manner, and there is nothing of an
alcoholic nature In them. If she we a,
wise girlâ and the girls of Gotham are
wise â she learns how to mix drinks
both ways and . you can take your
choice "by the asking. There are al
ways new drinks, and one of them Is
served with a .tiny ladle from the
depths of the shell of a grape fruit
which acts as a bunch bowl.
Serving things In their natural shells
is one of her fads.. Squash is boiled
and mashed, seasoned and beaten
light, and then is heaped into a great
hollowed out squash shell. Potatoes
are scooped out of their covers, are
seasoned and piled back, and are sent
to the table again as baked potatoes.
Fish is served In baked potato skins.
And there are delicious little salads
which are served in apples the middle
of which is scooped out.
All sorts of fruit are cut up and
served in grape-fruit skins; and now
there come the muskmelons filled
with ice cream, and the watermelons
with their scooped out insides refilled
with sweetened fruit. It is to be a
season of mother nature, says the fad
dish girl of Gotham.
If these were all the fads of the New
York girl it would be enough. But
they are not. She has fads galore.
Fads without number, fads unceasing,
fads present and fads to come.
She has a fad for wearing a shirt
waist without a collar and she loves
to turn in the neck of her shirt waist.
This Is when she golfs. She goes with

NEW FADS OF THE
NEW YORK GIRLwhich had been housed to come Â¦within
the law. The Helen was little better,
while, the Challenger Is a racer and the
Corinthian a\ freak. The Truant will
pass aiuster, the Presto has been en-
Benlcia. He turned out the Gadder
and the Villain. In tryouts both of
these yachts showed such speed that,
inasmuch 1 as the captain was a mem
ber of the San Francisco Yacht Club,
that body again sent in a challenge
for the cup.
The Gadder was rriet by the Truant
of the Corinthian Yacht Club, a Capo
Cod catboat that had been given an
overhanging bow and stern some years
befc-rei and .which ,in the early part of
1899 had displayed considerable speed.
The race took place on September
23. 1339; William N. McCarthy was at
the stick of the Gadder,' while John.
W. Pew,' the - owner of the Truant,
shaped her course. The Gadder won
out oil time allowance, getting the
trophy by ,one minute and fifty-eight
secc-ndsl
The Corinthians were not Â¦ satisfied
with the result, neither as to the race
nor the choice of boat they had select
ed to send after the cup, so the next
year they came back to the Aeolus.
On August 4 the Aeolus and Ga<Jjler
were sent to the line. Carl Westerfeid
was in command of the Aeolus and
"Charlie" Chapman handled the Gad-:
der, which the San l/ranciscos sent put

sharp practice In getting a crew
aboard that did not come under the
rule of amateurism. The trouble did
not come to light until the annual race
of the Pacific Interclub Yacht Asso
ciation, of that year, when the Cath
erine was disqualified and lost second
prize for having a yachtsman -aboard
whom the association did not consider
a bona fide member of the club.
In 1897 the third irace was sailed.
This time the Corinthians were the
challengers. The Aeolus, owned by
Carl Westerfeld and R. H. Morrow,
was sent after the cup. The Aeolus
was the latest production of the over
hang type and had won everything.
She was in the 30-foot class and
the Encinals sent the Fawn to the line
again, not that they thought she. would
win out. but it was all they had and
the remodeling of old boats had proven
an expensive luxury. ,
The race took "place on June 2o/l897,
and for yie only time in the history
of yachting on local waters, even to
the present day, the race was declared
off, as the yachts failed to cover the
course within the time limit because
of the lack of wind.
Six days later the S'achts were again
sent to the line. John "W. Pew was at
the stick Of the Aeolus arid J. A. Ros
slter was sailing master of the Fawn.
The Aeolus won easily with six min
utes and thirty-five seconds to spare.
The Aeolus, In this* rate and others
in the same year and in IS 98. proved
herself such a superior ooat that none
of the clubs on the bay cared to try
for the cup. In the meantime Captain
Matthew Turner ,was trying his hand
at building yachts at his shiuyards at

1896. The Fawn won by 6 minutes and
19 seconds and resistered the second
defeat for the San Franciscos. This
race came near wrecking the brotherly
love of the yachtsmen on the bay. for
the San Franciscos were accused of
As in the previous year, there was
nothing at the time of the challenge
in the Encinal that would have a show
with the Sausalito boat except 'the
Fawn, an out-and-out cruiser owned
by George Tyson. El Sueno's ex
perience stood the Encinnls in good
stead and they chopped off the plumb
bow of the Fawn and gave her an
overhang.
Nothing daunted the San Franciscoa
came back for it the next year. This
time , with William Sutherland's
Catherine, a craft that had been mod
ernized by having the plumb* bow and
stern chopped off and an overhanging
affair out on. She was in the 30-foot
class. . "\ >Â».
Up to El Sueno's time the yachts on
San Francisco Bay had clipper bows
and were full of body and light of
draft, Ideal boats for the shallow waters
of the bay. El Sueno was among the
first of the "spoonbow" boats. She was
almost ten feet longer on deck than the
Queen, with hardly any more accom
modations below.
The first boat sent after the cup by
the San Franciscos was C. H. Morrlll's
Queen. The Queen had won the open
championship cup, and it was thought
that she would have an easy time get
ting the "mug."
When the challenge -was sent In the
Encinal yachtsmen were In despair,
for they did not own a yacht that was
sailing in the class with the Queen
and by the deed of gift they could not
build one.
When things were the darkest the
late Commodore E. A. von Schmidt of
the California Club happened along
and showed the Alameda yachtsmen
how the E^ Sueno, owned by Com
modore Josenh A. Leonard, could be
worked over so that she would be
â¢within 10 per cent of the challenging
yacht. It required considerable hust
ling to get El Sueno In shape be
fore the time limit for the race *7aa
up. But on August 31, 1895, El
Sueno was sent to the line fit as a
fiddle. Captain Hanley was at the
stick of El Sueno. while "Eddie" How
ard was at the wheel of the Queen.
Before the yachts got to the channel
mark It was seen that El Sueno
had a lead that barring accident
would give her the race. She finally
crossed the line a winner by 8 minutes
and 25 seconds.
on August 31, 1895. The trophy had
been turned over to the Encinal Club
to defend, and the San Franciscos were
the first to try to capture it. In fact,
it has been the endeavors of the San
Francisco Club to capture and retain
It that have kept the trophy before tha
yachting public, for outside of this club
the others have taken very little Inter
est in it. The great majority of tha
Corinthian Club members do not be
lieve in the races and have only, built
the freak Corinthian to defend their
yachting honor.
THE evolution in the racing yacht,
as exemplified in the vessels that
have competed for the San Fran
cisco perpetual challenge cup.
shows in a small way the great
changes that have taken place in the
East and in England.
In ISSo the first challenger was the
Queen, an out-and-out cruising yacht
of the most wholesome type. ShÂ» is
still stanch, being the pride of the
of the Â£outh Bay Yacht Club.
The challenger this year is the
Corinthian, an out-and-out racing ma
chine of the freakish order. She is
nothing but a shell with a mass of
steel truÂ«swork to hold her together,
and will be of no service after the race
is over except to stand by until next
year, if i#ie should win, to go up
against a more pronounced type.
For those who care for nothing but
racing, and for the landlubber, the
last named vessel is all that can be
desired, but to the amateur yachts
man who takes his pleasure out of an
overnight cruise to some quiet ren
dezvous it is a delusion and a snare.
From time to time a howl goes up
to change the measurement rule for
handicapping in order to penalize these
freaks. But experience has taught
those who have been followers of the
sport that it will be of no use, for
there will be found designers whose
brains will successfully checkmate
Â« hatever restrictions there may be.
So if yachtsmen will race they must
expect to see productions like the
Corinthian and worse. The only way
to kill the freak is to stop racing.
Nothing in modern times has under
gone such a radical change as the
racing yacht. Within the last twenty
five years the Improvements, if they
can be called improvements, have been
very great.
. The modern nautical racing ma
chine, for the present craft has ceased
to be a yacht. Is a much faster vessel.
This is a statement which needs an
explanation, for the modern boat does
not cover a given distance any faster
than the record runs of a quarter of a
century ago. but the extreme speed
to-day is reached in much lighter
winds than years ago. It Is here that
the boat of the present lays claim to
its swiftness.
The speed gained In the '70's under
a twenty-knot breeze Is now reached
in a ten-knot wind. And as ten-knot
breezes are more ofte'n met with in
the great yachting centers of the
world than twenty-knot breezes, it can
easily be seen why the present craft is
considered so swift. The increased
rjÂ»eed Is the outcome of the evolution
of designing under a given rule of
jneayurement.
Twenty-five years apo a builder whit
tled out a model and built from It If
he was lucky in his whittling he had a
last boat. But to-day it is different.
Lverything in construction is laid down
on paper, and the errors of previous de
nsns. shown in actual sailing, are
suartlc-d against. It is here that the
crtat Improvement In speed has been
tÂ»btriined.
With the advent of the school of de-
Rien also came the study of construc
tion. The old wooden hulks were re-
I.laced with "the iron kettle." and from
the lattrr was evolved the bronze and
aluminum boat of to-day.
But have the preat chances been of
any service? If the present condition
\ >; aontin ff is considered It would be
hard to find the benefits, for outside of
the man with money the racing same
is dead and the wholesome cruiser a
thhiRof the oast. This is the condition
yf affair* on the Atlantic waters.
Yachting on San Francisco Bay is at
a most critical point, for on June 9
there will be a race for the SanFran
c-iÂ«-o perpetual challenge cup. Which
will be contested for by one of the
v r.rrt type of boats that has ever sailed
the bay. ,
It was caid two years ago that "the
sport v as going to the "bowwows"
* hen the cballencer of the San Fran
cisco lacht club came out, but If that
y as so at that time what must be said
of the challenging boat Corinthian of
to-day? It has been claimed that the
perpetual curÂ» is one of the worst fac
f on* In local yachting and lias not been
productive of any good. A review of
the boats that have raced for It may be
considered and the yachtsman left to
Judtre. Â¦Â¦.' Â¦Â¦. > '

A brief summary of the character
istics of the yacht*, from the Queen
to the Corinthian, that have partici
pated in thes* races will show the
evolution of the racing yacht on San
Francisco Bay:
The Qiipenâ A most desirable type.
El Sueno â Too deep and large for
thÂ° accemmodations offered.
. The Fawn and Catherine â Makeshifts
of the warmed over order.
Aeolusâ Built for speed at the ex
pense of cruising comfort.

mud while cruising.
The Challenger can scarcely fc3 used
"â¢â¢:â¢ cruising, but the Corinthian never.
Â¦ for this reason th? crew on the lat-
This is the opinion of the cruising
yachtsmen. But for those who race
and care for nothing else, the last
named vessel is their ideal.
The outcome of the race next Satnr
day is a question with many. Some of
the most txperienced yachtsmen thin*
the Corinthians have gone too far In
the freakish order in their boat and
claim if there is a hard wind that the
Challenger will have a good chance.
None, however, dispute the fact that if
the breezes blow lisht the Corinthian
will carry off the trophy. It. however,
remains to be seen if the racing yacht
as evolved to date will continue to. win
as in the past.

It'was a procession. The Aeolus won
by 25 minutes and 30 seconds.
This time It was the skipper that was
not satisfied with the results, j He had
built a yacht which he thousht had
lots of speed and the next year tent in
a challenge from the Vallejo Yachting:
and Boating Club, of which he was
commodore. This was the closest race
that has ever taken place for the tro
phy.
The Presto was called upon by the
Corinthians to â¢ defend the trophy
against Chapman's Helen.
The race took - place on August 10,
1901. There was plenty of wind to spare
.and the Helen had the race well in
hand until the last beat to windward,
when it lightened up and the Presto,
which was over-canvassed, was able to
pull up and win by 40 seconds.
While the racing was going on the
San Franciscos had not been Idle. They
sent East to R B. Crowninshield and
bought a design of a modern racing,
boat in the thlrtr-foot class. She was
built during the winter of 1901 and
1902 and was sent after the cup.
The race took place on Mav 21, 1002.
The Haryoon, a 36-footer, cut down to
go in the 30-foot class, owned by J. H.
Kharp and \V. H. Toepke, was put up
as the defender. The Harpoon was a
fast boat and Fred Iluss Cook sailed
her well, but she was not a match for
the San Francisco, syndicate boat.

10 minutes and 54 seconds in the lead.
There was to have been a race last
year, but the Corinthians did not build
their boat in time and the event went
over until now.

with him his daughter; a tactful,
charming girl, with a frank enthusiasm
for the wilderness in general and the
Little Otter In particular. A
Since Miss Strong's advent into the
wilderness the beavers had suffered
gross neglect. Those last few chap
ters of "The Beaver as He Really Is"
progressed but slowly. The natural
ist, sought his desk only late at night
or at odd hours in the early morning.
The rest of the time he \ was at the
colonel's camp, j
He took Miss Strong to the beaver
dams to explain to her the Intricacies
of their construction; he taught her
Â¦the best casts for trout and salmon :
he paddled her to the aalmon holes
up and down the stream. And all
this time a realization grew upon the
naturalist that the woods and their
occupants were not sufficient to his
happiness.
Three weeks went by all too quick
ly. The colonel had announced his
Intention to start for home two days
later. As the naturalist paddled home
ward in the red twilight he became
suddenly aware that two days later the
woods would be quite different. This
great, calm, comforting forest would
become a hateful, sterile desert without
Miss Strong. The naturalist dug his
paddle viciously Into the water. "Great
Scott! This imbecile mooning must be
stopped here and now!"
He hurried the remaining distance
back to camp and endeavored to con
centrate his mind â¢ on the long
neglected conclusion of his book. But
concentration is difficult when the for
est is enshrouded in a soft spring
night. â¢
After an hour's fruitless labor the
naturalist stalked down to the bank
of the stream and lighted his pipe.
He said many things about beavers
that you will search vainly for In
his published work. He sat on the
bank until the round moon, nearing
the full, came creeping above the
tree tops'. Then he suddenly arose
with the air of a man considerably
startled.
"Good heavens!" he said, with bdd
anxiety In his voice, "I'm in love with
the girl!" Â¦ . â¢
Two minutes later the canoe slid
noiselessly into the water, and the
naturalist paddled down stream with
unseemly haste.
As he came around the bend above
the colonel's camp he saw the girl sit-

The girl gave him a gay welcome.

you neglecting them now?"

OpfHE naturalist was vaguely dls
1 turbed. He paddled back to camp
I slowly, with a listless stroke, as
A if he were prone to turn back.
Now and then he ceased paddling and
gazed thoughtfully through the dark
ening underbrush of the woods.
Red twilight was falling, and against
the flaming western sky the tree-tops
made sharp, black silhouettes; beneath
the pines the blue-black shadows were
deepening. Countless voices drifted
out to him drowsily on the still air;
but the naturalist gave no heed to the
sublimity of the approaching forest
night, nor did he hear the gentle drone
Into which the myriad voices blended
themselves. v
The only vision his eyes beheld was
that of a smiling, graceful girl, waving
a white hand to him from the sloping
bank by the camp, and the only sound
in hla ears was her merry laughter as
she stood by her father's Bide and
shouted a good-by.
It was because of this that the nat
uralist was vaguely disturbed. Here
tofore the woods and their occupants
had chained his every thought. Now
he was aware - that every primary
thought centered about the girl, and
that everything else was but a sorry
second to her. v
The naturalist had been In the
woods all winter. . It was his intention
to correct several fallaciesâ absurd, but
none the less popularâ concerning the
beaver. With this idea in mind he had

THE DISTURBING ELEMENT
By John Barton Oxford
The days passed like a procession of
snails, but she did not appear, and
though, through the kindness of city
friends, he had a number of introduc
tions, he made no effort to discover her
identity. He had a strange, sweet con
sciousness â to which he held in spite of
disappointment and the deplorable sen
timentality into which it was leading
himâ that she was surely drifting
toward him. and that each dayÂ»brought
them near together.
Near the end of the third week his
faith was rewarded. It was on the
golf links, and a ripple of peculiarly
clear, frank laughter somewhere near
him caused him to turn his head. She
and a companion were sauntering to
ward him, every line of her lithe,
graceful figure standing out gloriously
against the pure background of the
eky, her brown hair framing her face
in a bewitching disorder.
On this glimpse of her Manice lived
for another week, and then his friend,
Duncan Brown, descended upon him
for the week's end stay. Duncan
would have been welcome under any
circumstances, but when he announced
that a great friend of his, Betty Als
ton, lived in Morrlstown, and offered
to take Manice to see her, the latter
pressed the freedom of hla bachelor
quarters upon him with added fer
vency, wondering If by chance he was
entertaining an angel unawares.
So, indeed, It proved.
"I think I saw you on the links the
other day,". Miss Alston remarked,
turning to Manice after the greetings
were over, and that gentleman always
wondered what he said In reply. The
one impression that he carried away
from that meeting was a confusing
sense of having been projected unex
pectedly Into the very midst of heaven.
That Impression, however, was not
lasting. Time revealed that if Miss
Alston was a guiding star, others be
sides himself were looking, raising their
eyes to her and following where she
led.
Still, he drew a sigh of relief at the
thought that he had two rivals Instead
of one. Always", in these matters, there
was safety in numbers.
Keeping a watchful eye upon two ri
vals Is wearing work even Ith a strong
man. If Manice had been fascinated
by Betty Alston's face, at : the end of
two months it was lovelier to him than
ever, for the better he knew her the
more assured he became of her sweet
ness and womanliness. Counted by con
ventional standards It was a pltfully
short time that they had known each
other, but he felt as if he had been
aware of her through all the thirty-five
years of waiting.
Thus his love, like a mighty wave.
"She loves me â she loves, God bless
her! I know It," Manice's thoughts,ran
during the days that followed, and,
though the hours seemed endless, not
once during that time did he approach
her. He shrewdly suspected that his
absence would do more than anything
else could to reveal her heart to her
self.
So su^e of his answer was he that
he- wanted to make the day memorable
to both of them. Many plans suggested
themselves, but none of them seemed
worthy. Then a chance remark of hers
flitted across, his mind and he mur
mured with enthusiasm: ."The .very
thing, by Jove!"
She had whimsically said to him once
that it was her idea of bliss to have
Hagadorn, the well-known organist,
play the wonderful organ at St. Mich
ael's an hour for her alone, and he de
cided that if Hagadorn was suscepti
ble to the persuasive power of money.
Bhe should have that pleasure.
"You are the only woman In the
world for me," he concluded, the color
that usually glowed under his tan
noticeably absent. "From the first
moment I knew it. I would have fol
lowed you to the ends of the earth
to tell you this, even though I had
known that you would refuse me!" '
Betty Alston, her face as white as
his own, turned to him with quivering
lips. His earnestness frightened her.
But there was* Jack Winterâ dear Jack
with the laughing eyes and the gay
smile! And yet Jack would never have
followed her out' of the crowd, andâ
She covered her -face with her hands,
and Manice, pitted against Fate,- set
his Jaw grimly.
"Is there any one else?" he asked at
last, and at the gentleness of his voice
Betty took courage.
"You don't know how unworthy I
feel," she began In a trembling voice.
"You see I don't know myself. I hate
myself for it, but I really don't. If you
love me like this, I ought to know,
oughtn't I, whether I love you or not?"
She looked at him with the puzzled
confidence of a child appealing to an
elder for help in a crisis. Then sud
denly the color came up over her soft,
white neck, rising higher and higher
until It suffused her whole face, and
the eyes that had been gazing so clear
ly and childishly Into his dropped. In
that moment her heart was clearer to
him than it was to herself.
"Think about It for a week, sweet
heart," he whispered, and, carrying her
hand to' his lips for a brief moment,
turned and left her.
whose crest, poised for a moment, must
inevitably spend Itself in foam, broke
into words. Simple, manly words they
were, falling from his lips almost bro
kenly, the very strength of his love
making him despair of saying what he
would.
All of which means that Floyd
Manice, usually the most dignified
and conservative of men, spent the
rest of the afternoon following a slim,
erect young woman at a very respect
ful distance and utterly without her
knowledge. *
At 6 p. m. he had the satisfaction of
teeing her enter a smart trap at Mor
rlstown, N. J., whither she had un
wittingly led him, and satisfied from
her manner that she was at home, he
â¢paced the platform waiting for the
train back to town and making plans
with . an exultant confidence born of
long eUCCCSS.
"Going to Morrlstown for the sum
mer, ch?" exclaimed his partner in
some surprise, when he announced his
Intention a week later, "I thought you
loathed New Jersey?"
. "Mistaken Idea of yours," responded
Manice with mendacious brevity. "By
the way, do you know any one there?"
Events usually moved with business
like, precision when Manice started to
accomplish an end. Within two weeks
from the day on which he first saw
his Ftar, as he called her to himself,
h* was astablfihed In Morrlstown, wait
ing in strong, serene, yet humble ex
pectation for her to appear once more
upon his horizon.
MANICE looked at his watch.
It was ten minutes past four
and he was already late for
an engagement. Neverthe
less, he dashed hastily Into the big de
, partment store, determined to procure
| the driving gloves that he sorely
' needed.
The tired clerks and Bhining pneu
matic tubes seemed to be in league to
(detain him, and he was Btrolling Im
patiently up and down. Inwardly re
(vlling the system that made such delay
/possible, when the eight of a tall, fair
fglrl. also waiting for change, trans
; formed his feelings like the touch of
a fairy wand. His impatience van
ished, his engagement was forgotten.
â¢ He had seen his ideal woman!
A weaker man might have failed to
Mdetect his chance in the mere passing
js^lmpse of a face In the crowd. Not
\uo. Manice. If Fate, in effect, said to
â¢him, "Don't you wish you knew her?"
he indomitably answered, "Trust me
âI shall know her!" And so the game
began.
Social customs he regarded as so
tnany fences Inclosing and dividing
the field of action. Under ordinary
circumstances he respected these de
fenses and skirted them decorously
Â¦until he came to gateways, like any
other well-bred individual. But the
case In hand was comparable only to
a cross-country ride, when the man
who. would be In at the death must
SO over the fences. Jump the ditches
fciid stay him not for gateways and
bridges.
(Coi:yri*ht, 1904. by M. McKea.)
But to his dismay he found that he
was not He did not understand the
gentleman's request and he refused the
offer somewhat haughtily. It was then
that Manice appealed to the man, ig
nored the artist, and at the end of his
brief but somewhat shame-faced ex
planation Hagadorn was smiling gen
ially.
"I'll do it with pleasure," said he,
holding out his hand.
"And of course you'll know Just â
well, Just the right sort of music?" sug
gested Manice. "The sort that will
that willâ"
"Yes," assented the organist, "I think
I know the Bort," and they parted in
great good humor.
At the end of that rapturous hour, of
wonderful music in the 7 dim interior
of St. Michael's next day, Betty sim
ply turned her humid eyes upon Manice
and held out her hands. It was not
until she had gained the poise and
assertion of six months of wlfehood
that she accused him of taking an un
fair advantage.- ,
"As If any girl could have refused
such a lover!" she taunted, ruffling hia
hair disgracefully. "It. was what the
papers call clap-trap."

WV.2sJon"a!]y rising to a snarl of cx
\^ asperated, jea!ous rase. His
mistress, Carmen, dainty, prettyâ from
Â¦appearances very far from being a per
son capable of ruling and restraining
the big. fierce cat animals of the circus
â was standing In front of his cage.
Ordinarily the sight of Carmen
' caused the big panther to set up an
affectionate purring. But on the pres
ent occasion Tom Howard, the best
athlete in the great circus, was talking
to the 'pretty Carmen. It was plain,
even to a black panther, that the in
terest Howard took in Carmen was
more than friend:y. It was also plain
that Carmen was far from displeased
aÂ£ this interest. And that was the
reason the big panther was growling.
For a deep and consuming jealousy of
stalwart Tom Howard filled Chita's
heart. â¢
Just then a warning be'.l rang. This
was the signal for Carmen to get reaay
for her great "Animal School Act."
Her scholars were not rosy-cheeked
boys and girls, but a very grim-look-
As he took his place he looked at the
crowd with languid curiosity, yawned
and acted like a lion who considered
a school for a lion of his years as a
nuisance, but not enough of one to
make a fuss over.
But the big Bengal tiger evidently
was in an Ugly frame of mind. At
first he refused to enter the cage. Car
men struck 1 him lightly with her whip.
Like a flash the big lips curled up,
showing .the, long, sharp tiger fangs,
and at the same time he gave a snarl
of rage, low and rumbling at first, but
rising until it re-echoed from every
part of the circus tent. But Carmen
The Numidian lion walked into the
cage in a lazy, nonchalant manner. He
ing set of pupils, consisting; of Chita,
the big Bengal User, and Diogenes,
the sleepy, but big-maned, strong
jawed Numidian lion.
In this act each of the great felines
left his own cage and entered a larger
one in which Carmen was seated on
a low chair, a small rod, the symbol
of her authority, in her hand. Chita
trotted willingly into this cage. He
was devoted to Carmen and now that
Tom Howard was out of sight there
was nothing to disturb his good na
ture.

looked him steadily In the eye and,
after a moment's hesitation, the great
striped beast slunk to his place. It
was plain that he was in a dangerous
mood. Despite the tiger's temper the
lesson would probably have pone on as
usual had not Tom Howard happened
to step beyond the entrance of the coy
â¢ ered way leading to the Quarters of the
circus people when they are not in the
ring. Tom was always intensely wor
ried when Carmen was giving her ani
mal school act. It was this anxiety
which led him to leave the circus quar
ters. But his well meant consideration
proved costly. . .
As Tom stepped from the canvas
covered passageway Chita, saw him-
The sight stirred the black panther's
smoldering Jealousy. Ke stopped
abruptly In his role as Carmen's pupil.
Jumped oft the pedestal on which hs
had been sitting at "attention" and
sent forth a fierce, snarling growl. In
which he expressed his* hatred of the
man who he felt had usurped first
place in his mistress* heart.
At the first notes of ths angry snarl
Carmen turned reprovingly to the bla^k
panther. She knew there was not the
least danger of her pet attacking her.
But he must Â£O on with his perform
once or the act would be a failure.
-Chita." she said, in reproachful
tones, looking straight into the angry
panther's eyes. And as she did this she
turned her back on the still sullen Ben
gal tiger.
The big tiger had been growing more
and more sulky as the act proceeded.
His nerves were in a bad state, and the
angry snarl -of the panther had been
the finishing touch. Now Carmen hart
taken her eyes off him- That settled
It. He dropped from his pedestal to
the floor of the cage, gathered himself
for. the sprin- and the next instant
was shooting through the air. a black
and yellow bar of deacy erxergy.
The impact of the shock threw Car
men to the floor. But quick a3 thÂ«
Bengal tiger had been, the panther vas
quicker. All thought of Jealousy van
ished at Eight of the attack on his mis
tress. Before the tiger could use tooth
or claw the lithe, strong-limbed pan
ther had launched himself right at the
tiger's throat.
Over and over on the floor of the cage
the two great cats rolled. Ordinarily
the panther Â¦would have been no match
for the far larger tiger. But the pan
ther had caught his grip first, settling
his sharp, deep-biting teeth in the
tiger's throat. This prevented the
tiger's using his teeth effectually. But
hi3 claws, especially those on his strong
hind legs, could be used. Again and
again he struck out with them, ripping
through the panther's skin like a soft
glove. But he could not shake the
deadly grip Chita had on his throat.
Although he might be torn to pieces by
the great claws. Chita meant to hold on
until he felt his teeth meet in his oppo
nent's windpipe. And through all the
terrible struggle. Diogenes, the Numld
lan lion, sat on his pedestal, lazy, good
natured, only calmly Interested in the
life and death fight of his fierce fellow
pupils.
"When the circus men separated the
two big cats the Bengal tiger was
dead, and the black panther, torn In
twenty pieces, was dying. Carmen
was unhurt, except for a few slight
bruises caused by her fall on the floor
of the cage. Tom Howard was fore
most among: the crowd which had
rushed to the cage. As Carmen placed
her hand on the head of tha big pan
ther who had died to save her. Chita
opened his great yellow eyes, now fast
dimming In death. But even In death
the ruling passions of his fierce wild
animal nature held strong. Ills eyes
brightened with affection at tha sight
of Carmen. Then his glance fell on
Tom Howard. The Jealous snarl start
ed from deep down In his throat, he
half raised his head. Then It sank
down and the black Â©anther's eyes
closed forever.
And Diogenes, the bli-manad lion,
sat on his pedestal, calm, nonchalant,
disinterested, aloof. He was waiting
for the signal. "School la over." It
did not come. Diogenes waited a lit
tle longer. Then he opened his great
jaws In a half-suppressed yawn,
dropped to the floor of the exhibition
cage and trotted lazily off to the
most comfortable corner of his own
cage.

BY BISHOP HENRY C. POTTER.
I have been asked to discuss some
of the bravest and most opportune
problems which now confront the
American people â problems dealing
with the welfare of the people" at
large, with the sacredness of the'home
and family and with the happiness of
men and women as individuals. It is.
impossible to deal with such a wide
and important range of subjects at
this time and in this manner, except in
the most cursory way.
But in discussing the pitfalls and
dangers assailing us as a people, one
of convenience In name, we hallow and
observe It most religiously in fact. Pov
erty If not a disgrace Is somehow ac
counted an Impertinence, and the vul
garities of ostentatious display are par
donable, and even admirable. In precise
proportion to the size of the fortune
that indulges them.
Love Is not for sale, and that mys
terious sentiment which must be won
and deserved â not * purchased â never
goes along with the Jointure nor can
be made over with transfers of real
estate. One of the greatest tragedies
in modern life Is the desperate effort
to put heart in such transactions and
so ennoble a bargain with an emotion.
And women? Do we not know that
there are thousands of them to whom
a home is as impossible a thing as a
castle in Spain? Do we not know that
there are thousands of them who have
no human being except themselves to
depend upon? Especially on this
Eastern sea coast women are redund
ant. I have no sympathy with a radi
calism of female reform, but some
thing must be done. Our American
women, thank God, have never re

Is there really any danger of racial
suicide in thiB country? If so, what
are the primary causes?
Are there any seeds of revolution in
ths war between capital and labor and
when will the harvest be reaped?
And is immense wealth a curse or a
blessing?
That Bishop Potter is perhaps better
able to answer these vital questions
wisely and impartially than any other
man in American life may be Inferred
not only from his scholarly equipment,
but from his wide experience extending
over forty years as rector of Grace
Church in this city, as Bishop of New
York, as head of a great labor arbitra
tion committee and as a profound stu
dent of the great social and political
questions of the day. Perhaps his most
enduring monument is the Cathedral
of St. John the Divine, now building
in this city. Its vastness may be con
jectured In that the huge pile on Wash
ington Heights will not be completed
for another generation.

There is much to be said on both
sides. Christ did not denounce wealth
any more than he denounced pauper
ism. He did not abhor money â he
used It. He did not abhor tha com
pany of rich men â he sought it. What
he denounced was the love of wealth;
the lust of riches; the vulgar snob
bishness that chose exclusively tha
fellowship or the ways of rich men â
greed and luxury and self-indulgence.
But It Is quite another question when
we have to do with that class of cap
italists whose manipulations of val
ues have essentially no quality that U
different from the legerdemain of the
card sharper. Their directorial chi
canery In connection with great cor
porations is one of the deepest stains
on our commercial honor.
Those Whom the Honest Will Avoid.
These are the capitalists with whom
honest men can hold- no Intercourse:
(a) Managers and directors who, by
manipulation of the stock market in
collusion with others, artificially de
press values to the Ics3 of fellow in
vestors, (b) Managers or directors of
vast corporations who withhold reg
ular reports for their own personal
advantage, (c) Managers or directors
who employ intricate and obscure sys
tems of bookkeeping which mislead or
deceive. v
It is at once needful and needless to
point out the danger of the divorce
habit which is assailing us. As in the
dlsaffections between capital and labor,
th*Â» differences betwen husband and
wife can, in a great majority of cases,
be settled outside the court of last re
sort. A little more patience and con
sideration shown each other will large
ly eliminate this great and growing
danger to American progress and wel
fare as a nation.
Taking up the relation of the citizen
to the industrial situation, this matter
of arraying class against mass Is of
exceptional interest just now, not only
because such differences become acuta
in the warmer rather than the colder
seasons, but because we are on the
eve of a national election. This sullen
class hatred, which is quite as acuta
here under our Democratic or Repub
lican form of government as in the
middle ages, constitutes a menace not
only to the relations which bind to
gether certain industrial interests, but
our whole social fabric.
The Lust of Riches.
As for our mothers, it is certainly
regrettable that American women of a
certain prominent class are opposed to
large families. Formerly the best
women and men of the young republic
came from large families. It was the
association of large families of chil
dren with each other, the doing for
each other and their mutual bits of
self-denial that made the men â¢Â£
strong character and the women of
noble domestic lives of other genera
tions.
I am asked if the women of this.
country, in my opinion, have too much
independence. Our American women
have their autonomy more largely than
the women of any other country in the
world. English women come next in
point of liberty â personal freedom. In
France they have less Independence,
and when one reaches Italy he finds
the freedom of women there even more
curtailed.

When we consider the modern fashion

that beautiful contour and fair whits

a woman's neck should be: fair and

The great army of professional and
business women who must present a
neat, fashionable attire during the Ions
hours of the day are the greatest suf
ferers from unshapely necks. ThÂ«
secret of the difference Is simply this.
The class of women first named spend
the major portic-n of their wakln*
hours in dainty gowns more or* less
open at the neck or softly trimmed at
that part of the garment. The acces
sories which go with the tallor-mada
guwns are worn by these women for
but a few hours dally. The attempt
to Introduce the Dutch or collarless
waist has Droved a failure and de
servedly so. for It is decidedly too neg
ligee for good form to be worn in pub
lic, although I advise any woman to
indulge In this freedom whenever sho
can do so in the privacy of her own
home, for Its beautifying effects. A
happy compromise is found in the
transparent perforated collars and In
stocks of soft silk, linen and embroid
eries with or without a thin lining, and
boneless. These dainty accessories give

the removal of lines, but also In the
banishment of blemishes such as pim

this line of culture, and I cannot un
derstand how any woman can be In
different to her personal appearance, I
wish to give a few words of encourage
ment, as well as to correct any false
impressions they may now have. First
of all. do not expect to eradicate in
a few days or months that which na
ture has taken years to Implant. We,
like the gardener, must work patiently.
He wisely plants his seeds and awaits
developments, knowing full well that
a firm root Is the first essential to a
healthy growth. Faithful work will
surely be rewarded in time, but. unless
you are' an exceptional case, a marlfed
improvement will scarcely be noticed
under two months of faithful care;
skins that have been fairly starved will
require longer treatment before mate
rial results will be seen. Like all forms
of exercise, regularity is the keynote of
success. All of us are aware how every
one who attains perfection in any line
must adhere faithfully to regular rules,
no matter how distasteful, yet there
always seems to be a disposition to
shirk when physical culture pure and
simple is involved after the first enthu
siasm wears off. Hence, I again urge
the necessity for serious work to In
sure success. While massage is an in
valuable aid in cleansing the skin, do
not expect to cure blemishes by mas
sage Rlone. for it cannot be done un
less the eruptions are entirely due to
overclogged pores* Bathing, rational
diet, exercise are all important factors
'which must not be overlooked nor neir
lected.
A pointed, projecting chin always
tells of avarice, especially if the sub
ject has a long, hooked nose, for that
combination is the fatal sign of a
miser. *
A square chin of good size with an
indentation In the center is the ac
companiment of a firm, capable na
ture. The girl who has such a chin
will be a good business woman, one
to be relied upon and a thorough help

A round and full, well formed chin

RINGWORM ON THE FACE (Es
â¢telle) â This common eruption, appear
ing on the face and frequently on the
hands, resembles a burn at first and
generally forms in circular patches or
a patch which enlarges as the disease
spreads. Intense itching, especially
when the spot Is exposed to heat or Is
rubbed, accompanies the trouble. The
spot or spots should be thoroughly
cleansed with .warni water and pure
soap. Keep a soft rag especially for
this purpose and destroy it when no
longer required. An effective remedy
consists in painting a ring of iodine
around the eruption to prevent its fur
ther enlargement and applying a heal
ing ointment. Obtain one-half ounce
of colorless iodine from the druggist,
together with a small camel's hair
brush. The ordinary iodine may be
used, but it will leave a stubborn stain
on the skin for some weeks, while the
colorless does not stain and is quite as
effective. Paint around the spot a half

the spot with sulphur ointment and it

BENEFITS OF DEEP BREATHING
(T. B. L.)â The value of correct breath
ing cannot be overestimated, although
comparatively few people seem to real
ize its true relation to the perfect de
velopment of health and beauty. The
three most Important results from cor
rect breathing are the purification of
the blood, the production of animal
heat and the curative powers resulting
from the mechanical action of deep
breathing by the expansion and con
traction of the diaphragm and muscles
of the chest. As the blood circulates
it gathers the poison of the body, car
bonic acid, which is a combination of
oxygen and carbon, two elements found
in the body having a strong affinity for
each other. This poisonous waste,
brought to the lungs by the blood, is
quickly dissipated when brought in con
tact with pure air by increased oxy
genatlon of the blood by the process of
breathing. This being the case, it is
easy to see why Imperfect breathing
fails to purge the blood and lungs suf
ficiently; the natural results therefore
are nervousness, headache, lung trou
bles, etc., and which as a rule are un
known to persons who habitually prac
tice deep breathing* and take pains to
obtain all the fresh air possible every
hour of the day and night. The com
mon manner of breathing may be di
vided in this way: breathing from the
upper part of the lungs and abdominal
breathing. The first is peculiar to wom
en, largely because the custom of wear-
Ing tight bands and corsets makes it
almost impossible for the lower ribs to
expand, hence the upper chest muscles
do the work largely and, of course, the
low'er air cells of the lungs suffer. In
abdominal breathing the abdominal
wall is forced outward as the dia
phragm falls downward, while the
chest remains almost Immovable. The
only way to obtain the life-giving bene
fits of full breathing 13 to loosen the
clothing about the waist and chest
and practice breathing a3 often as
time and strength will permit, clad
only in a gown which hangs free from
the shoulders.

dances In her mind cannot be ex
pected to remember whether such a
tiny thing as an apron has strings in it
or not. And that Is one of her biggest,
mistakes if she did but realize it. Every
man, no matter how old or how young,
likes to see a woman interested In a
home, in short, to be more or less do
mesticated. And If she hasn't any
strings on her apron she certainly can
not hope to tie him to them.

The apron does not consist merely of
a bit of elastic,, though of a truth it is
not much more difficult to fashion. The

a piece cut off the top so that It will

little piece, by the way,\ serves as the
pocket a little later on. Embroidery
makes a pretty finish, but plain lawn

more fit. for it does not conflict in any
way with the design of the handker

rather than detracts. The same mate

Mr. . Senior and Miss Senior, of this

Ideals of the scholarly life..
How poor the world would be with
out'the pouring Into Its depleted life of
the fresh enthusiasm of these , fair
young graduates tha country over.
Their contribution to the body .politic
cannot easily be calculated.- Before the
advance of this shining host stretchlns
from Maine to California, It seems as if
all the evils of the world would have to
go down. How can shams* and corrup
tions and Intrenched wrongs resist the
onset of the energy, the 'knowledge and
consecration to be found In the boys
and girls, the young men and the
young women who are going out dur
ing these passing, weeks from our edu
cational institutions? The world needs
them sorely and they will not disap
point our hopes.
Only let them realize as they go that
knowledge must be yoked with faith,
learning with loving. If they are to
make themselves tell and attain true
success. For there Is only one thins:
.better than a .thoroughly
Â¦well-informed mind, and that Is a pure,
unselfish heart.
MR. J. L FARRYSEE was
strong on morality. It didn't
make any difference to him
what other people thought or
did, he was convinced that he
was the sole proprietor and manufac
turer of the only pure brand of moral
ity on the market. All others were base
imitations put up with intent to de
ceive. Most people are fairly scrupu
lous about the great things of moral
ity; they are unwilling to commit mur
der unless they consider that it Is ab
solutely necessary and they will not
rob a bank, at least not unless they
happen to be officially connected with
the institution. There Is also a preju
dice in polite society against throwing
one's gray-haired father out in the
street, at least as long as he can pay
his board and help take care of tha
thildren.
All these things and many more the
average citizen attends to with more
or less care and without taking to him
self much more than a due amount of
pride. But Mr. Farrysee wasn't sat
isfied with any such outline study of a
moral system as that. What he cried
aloud for with the voice of a sewing
machine agent In the wilds of Mich
igan was a system of ethics that
ebould be wind, water and dust proof,
varnished inside and out, guaranteed
Found In vrind and limb, and safe In all
weathers. Most people are honest In
the rough â and the rougher the bet
terâbut they can't always be counted
on to go out of the way to return an
umbrella or to tell the other man about
the Jump in the stock market that he
can expect the day after to-morrow.
Mr. Farrysee regarded these average
individuals as perhaps a shade better
than ordinary assassins, but he was in
clined to the belief that the difference
was scarcely perceptible to the naked
conscience.
The theory on which Mr. Farrysee
regulated his comings and goings and
likewise his stayings was that an hon
est man is the noblest work of God,
and he was accustomed to supplement
this idea with the further statement
that he was about the only perfect
specimen of that rare work now ex
tant. Not only was he strong on hon
esty and the other virtues, but he held
very firmly to the belief that the chief
duty of man is to help his fellow men.
To this end he permitted his name to
parade in large type at the head of
every list of contributors to the fresh
air fund and the free coal fund and
the fund for the assistance of all the
deserving who can prove that they
have been respectable for at least two
consecutive years, it was nothing to
himâ except as a source of sadnessâ
that the majority of men are occupied
principally with the effort ; to corner
the world's visible supply of hundred
dollar bills. ' Let those who would give
their minds : to the accumulation of
sordid although useful and . more or
lees necessary" bank accounts. He
would be satisfied with the modest
competence that he had received 'from

before the youth of the land as a shin
ing example of all that a man should
be he was also holding stock in two
or three corporations that were care
fully and elaborately robbing the Gov
ernment, the. public and every one else
in sight. All the railroads that he was
interested. In were charging three prices
for the mail contracts and knocking
the spots off the anti-trust law at every
opportunity. Â¦ His pet telegraph com
pany was busily engaged in furnishing
the news of the latest happenings at
all the tracks on the circuits to the
Institutions whose principal function in
llf-j is to separate . sporty young men
from their fathers' money. Most of the
city property that he owned was cov
ered with tenements that would have
made a pig sty look like the Moorish
room at the Waldorf.
To make matters worse. Mr. Farry
see knew all about these things and
was highly Indignant when It was put
up to him to inform the general public
what he was going .to do about it.
To all inquiring friends â from the
newspapersâ he replied that these were
private matters and had nothing to do
with him in his public capacity. When
the. Grand Jury camped on his trail,
however, and the District Attorney
started out to make a little call on
him with a fire ladder . and an ax he
suddenly acquired an overdose of ap
oplexy and departed immediately for
the. land where the coupon clips no
longer and the water stock Is furled.
The point that should be emphasized
by Mr. Farrysee's. career is that he not
only,, refused to let his right hand know
wtiat h\B , left hand' was up to, but he
also withheld that very Interesting In
formation Â¦ from the rest of the â¢ world.
This i leads us to . the valuable conclu
sion that the reason for â¢ the ' soulless
ness of corporations is to ,be found in
the fact that the directors use up all
of their souls outside of business
hours. -.â¢ .;..-Â¦â¢ '.":Â¦ ' Â¦- -.-.-.

The great brass pans hanging under

could eat your dinner off the red-tiled

a row of empty sabots, and woe betide
the Dutchman who would dream of
crossing It in anything but his stock

Every spring they are freshly painted.

seizes" hold of It, and will not let it go
till it has done its tale of work. The
wind is the Dutchman's servant; be
fore he lets it loose again it has turned
ten thousand mills, has pumped the
water and sawed the wood, has light
ed the town and worked the loom, and
forged the Iron, and driven the great,
slow, silent wherry, and played with
the children in the garden. It Is a
sober wind when it gets back to sea,
worn and wearj', leaving the Dutch
man laughing behind his everlasting
pipe.
There are canals In Holland down
which you pass as through a field' of
wind-blown corn; a soft, low, rustling
murmur even In your ears. It is the
ceaseless whirl of the great mill sails.
Far out at sea the winds are as fool
ish a3 savages, fighting, shrieking,
tearing, purposeless. Here, in the
streets of mills, it is a civilized wind,
FOLKS suffering from Jingoism,
spread-eagleism, chauvinismâ all
such like Isms, to whatever coun
try they belongâ would be well

U the idea of the moment that Â«lze
spells happiness. The bigger the coun
try, the better one Is for living there.
The happiest Frenchman cannot possi
bly be as happy as the most wretched
Englishman, for the reason that Eng
land possesses many more thousands of
F(juar<Â» miles than France possesses.
The Swiss peasant compared with the
Russian serf must, when he looks at
the map of Europe and Asia, feel him
self to be a miserable creature. The
reason that everybody In America Is
happy and good is to be explained by
*he fact that America has an area
equal to that of the entire moon. The
American citizen who has backed the
wrong horse, missed his train and lost
his bag remembers this and feels
reeked up again. According to this ar
pument fishes should be the happiest
of mortals, the sea consistingâ at least
Â¦to Fays my atlas, I have not measured
it myself â of 144,000,000 of square miles.
But', maybe, the sea is also divided in
Â¦ways we wot not of. Possibly the sar
dine who lives near the Brittany coast is
Fad and discontented because the Nor
wegian sardine Is the proud inhabitant
of a larger sea. Perhaps that is why
he has left the Brittany coast. Ashamed
at bÂ« ing a Brittany sardine, he has emi
grated to Norway, has become a natur
alized Norwegian sardine and Is him
self again. â¢ The happy Londoner on
i oggy. days can warm himself with' the
reflection that the sun never sets on the
'British empire. He does not often see
the sun, but that is a mere detail. He
xtgards himself as the owner of the
tunâ the sun begins his little day in the
British empire, ends his little day in
the British empire; for all practical
purposes the sun is part of the British
empire. Foolish people in other coun
tries ?it beneath it and feel warm, but
that is only their ignorance; they do
not know it is a British possession; if
thoy did they would feel cold.
My views on this subject are. I
know, heretical. I cannot get it into
my unpatriotic head that sire is the
only thing worth worrying about. In
England, when I venture to express
my out of date opinions, I. am called
a Little Englander. Jt fretted me at
f.rst. I was becoming a mere shadow.
Rut by now I have got used to it. It
would be the same, I feel, wherever
I went. In New York I should be a
Little American: in Constantinople a
Little Turk. But I wanted to talk
Â«bout Holland. A holiday In Holland
serves ks a corrective Â¦ to exaggerated
imperialistic notions. There are no
7<opr in Holland. They may be an un
happy people, knowing what a little
rountry it is they live in; but, if so,
they bide the fact. To all seeming,
the Dutch peasant, smoking his
pipe, is as much a man as the White
chape! hawker or the moocher. of the
Paris boulevard. I saw a beggar once
in Holland â on the townlet of Enk
hulsen. Crowds were hurrying up
from the side streets to have a look at
him; the idea at first seemed to be
that he was doing it for a bet. , He
turned out to be a Portuguese. They
offered him work on the docks â until
he could get something better to doâ
at wages equal in English money to
about 10 shillings a day. I Inquired
about him on my way back through
the town next day and was told he
had borrowed a couple of florins from
the foreman and had left by the even
ly train. It Is not the country for
the loafer. In Holland work is easily
found; this takes away the charm of
looking for it. A farm laborer in
Holland lives in a brick built house of
six rooms, which generally belongs to
him, with an acre or so of ground;
and only eats meat once a day. The
rest of his time he fills up on eggs and
chicken and cheese ffhd beer. But you
rarely hear him- grumble. His wife
and daughter may be- seen on Sundays

On colder da vs the women wear
bright colored capes made of fine spun
silk; from underneath the ample folds
of which you sometimes hear a little
cry â and sometimes a littie hooded
head peeps out, regards with prete
natural thoughtfulness the toylike
world without, then dives back into
shelter. .As for the childrenâ women In
miniature, the single difference in dres3
being the gay pinafore â you can only
say of them that they look like Dutch
dolls. But such a plump, contented,
cheerful little dolTs! ". You . remember
the hollow-eyed.- pale-faced dolls you
see swarming in the great big and
therefore .. should-be happy countries,
and wish that more land surface were
of less importance to our statesmen
and our able editors, and the happiness
and well-being of the mere human
items worth. a little more_ of their
thought. The Dutch peasant lives sur
rounded by canals and reaches his cot
tage across a drawbridge. I suppose it
is In the blood of the Dutch child not
to tumble Into the canal, and the Dutch
mother never appears to anticipate
such possibility. One can imagine the
average English mother trying to bring
up a family in a house surrounded by
canals. She would never have a mo
ment's peace until the children were in
bed. But then the mere sight of a ca
nal to the English child suggests the
delights of a sudden and unexpected
bath. I put it to a Dutchman once,
"Did the Dutch child by any chance
ever fall into a canal?" Â¦ "Yes," he re
plied, "cases had been known." "Don't
you do anything for it?" I inquired.
"Oh, yes," he answered, "we haul them
out again." "But what I mean is," I
explained, "don't you do anything to
prevent their falling in â to save them
from falling In again?" "Yes," he an
swered, "we spank 'em." There Is al
ways a wind in Holland. It comes
from over the sea. There is nothing to
stay Its .progress. It leaps the low
dykes and sweeps with "a shriek across
the sad soft dunes, and thinks it is go
ing to have a good time and play havoc
in the land. But the Dutchman laughs
behind his great pipe as it comes to
him shouting and roaring. "Welcome,
my hearty, welcome," ' he chuckles,
"come blustering and bragging; the
bigger you are the better I like you."
And when It is once in the land, be
hind-the long, straight dykes, behind
the house to start a local .. museum
anywhere outside of Holland.
On high days and holidays, of which
In Holland there are plenty, the aver
age Dutch vrouw would be well worth
running away with. The Dutch peas
ant girl has no need of an illustrated
Journal once a week to tell her what
the fashion is; she has it ln'thepor
tralt of her mother, or of her grand
mother,- hanging over . . the- glittering
chimney piece. When the Dutch woman
builds a dress she builds it to last; it
descends from mother to. daughter, but
It is made of sound material In the
beginning. A lady friend of mine
thought the Dutch costume would serve
well for a fancy dress ball, bo set about
buying one. But she abandoned the no
tion on learning what it would cost her.
A Dutch girl in her Sunday- clothes must
be worth. fifty pounds before you come'
to ornaments. In certain provinces she
'wears a close : fitting helmet, made,
either of solid silver or of solid gold.
The Dutch gallant, before making him
self known, walks on tiptoe a little
while behind the loved one and looks
at himself in her headdress Just to
make sure that his hat is on straight
and his front curl Just where It ought
to be. In most other European coun
tries national costume Is dying out. The
slop shop is year by year entending its
hideous trade. But the. country of Ru
bens and Rembrandt, of Tenters and
Gerard. Dow, remains still true to art.
The picture postcard does not exagger
ate. The men in thos,e wondrous baggy
knickerbockers, from the pockets of
which you sometimes see a. couple of
chickens' ' heads protruding; in gaudy
mighty sabots, smoking their groat
pipes; the women in their petticoats of
many hues, in gorgeously embroidered
vest, in chemisette of dazzling' white,
crowned with a halo of" many frills, g lt
tering in gold and silverâ are not the
creatures of an artist's .fancy. You
meet them In their thousands on holi
day afternoons, walking gravely arm
in arm, flirting with sober pmch sto
lidity. ,. Y;,'
But they tell me it Is not quite right
yet. One needs to save up beforehand
if onÂ© desires to spend any length of
time In Holland. One talks of dear old
England, but the dearest land In all the
world Is little Holland. The florin thera
Is equal to the franc in. France and to
the shilling in England. They tell you
that cigars are cheap In Holland. A
cheap Dutch cigar will last you a day.
It is not until you have forgotten tha
taste of it that you feel you ever want
to smoke again. I knew a man who
reckoned he had saved hundreds oÂ£
pounds by smoking Dutch cigars for a
month steadily. It was years before hs
smoked again.
Watching building operations In Hol
land brings home to you forcibly what
previously you have regarded as a
meaningless formula, namely, that tha
country is built upon piles. A dozen
feet below the level of the street on*
sees the laborers working In fisher
men's boots, up to their knees In water,
driving the great wooden blocks Into
the mud. Many of the older houses
slope forward at such an angle that
you almost fear to pass beneath them.
I should be as nervous as a kitten liv
ing In one of the upper stories. But the
Dutchman leans out of a window, that
Is hanging above the street six feet be
yond the perpendicular and smokes
contentedly. Â¦-. .-,Â»;
They have a merry custom in Holland
of keeping the railway time twenty
minutes ahead of the town time â or is
It twenty minutes behind? I can never
remember when I'm there and I am
not sure now.. The Dutchman himself
never knowa. "You've" plenty of time."
he says, "tho station Is a mile away.
and It is now half -past nine." Tes, but
that means ten-twenty," he answers,
"you have nearly an hour." Five min
utes later he taps you on the shoul
der. "My mistake;. it's twenty to ten.
I was thinking the other way about It.**
Another argues with him that his first
Idea was right. They work it out by
scientific methods. Meanwhile you
have dived Into a cab. The result Is
always the same; you are either forty
minutes too soon or you have missed
the train by twenty minutes. A Dutch
platform Is always crowded with wom
en explaining volubly. to their husbands
either that there was not any need
to have hurried, or else that the thins
would have been to have started half
an hour before they did, the man In
both -cases being, of course, to blame.
The men walk up and down and swear.
The Idea has been suggested. that the
railway time and the town time should
be made to conform. The argument
against the Idea Is that If It were car
ried out then there would be nothing
left to put the Dutchman out and worry
him. ...... .. V- Â»C'
jrrerred to be that he was right. Tha
batch boy, when he runs, pxxt3 them
tor preference on his hands and uses
them to hit other Dutch boys over the
head as he passes. The roads in Hol
land, straight and level and shaded
all the way with trees, look from the
railway carriage window as If they
â¢would be good tor cycling:, bat this is
delusion. I crossed in the boat from
Hawwlch once with a well known
black and whits artist and an equally
well known and highly respected hu
morist They had their bicycles with
them, intending to tour Holland. I
met them a fortnight later In Delft,
or, rather. I met their remains. I
was horrified at first; I thought It was
drink. They could not stand still,
they could not sit still, they trembled
and shook In every limb, their teeth
chattered when they tried to talk. Tho
humorist hadn't a joke In him. The
Â«xtl3t could not have drawn his own
salary: He would have dropped It
on the way to his pocket. The Dutch
roads are paved their entire length
with cobbles â big, round cobbles, over
which your bicycle leaps and springs
and plunges. If you see Holland out
side the big towns a smattering of
Dutch Is necessary- If you know Ger
man there is not much difficulty.

THE RAGE IN LONDON
For at Guru the British force turned
up as fit as a fiddle. And there it was
that, resenting being disarmed, the Ti
betans, under the worst possible con
ditions for themselves, being huddled
together in an inclosure, first tried a
little fighting. With their antiquated
weapons against magazine rlCes, ma
chine guns and disciplined troops, they
fared much as a pack of sheep would
have done that had turned on a lot of
lions. Hundreds of them were slain.
Nothing could more strikingly reveal
the Jingo spiritâ Imperialism 13 the
popular name for it â which at present
possesses the British public, than this
comment of a London journal: "It
speaks in the highest praise of the
discipline of our men that the whole
(Tibetan) force was not exterminated.
The lesson taught the priestly fanatics
of Lhassa has been a sharp one (> but it
cannot end here. This fray furnishes
a perfect illustration of the arrogant
Ignorance and overweening folly *of the
Lamas." Patriotism begets a strange
form of mental astigmatism.
One result of the expedition has been
the discovery of the filthiest town on
earth. Phari is its name, which In the
Tibet language means "pig hill," a very
appropriate designation, save that it
necessitates some apologies to the pig.
Nothing has ever been cleaned at
Phari since It was built, and it is es
timated that the fort is some 400 years
old. In the best quarters of the town
where the houses are two-storied, the
accumulation of filth rises- to the first
floor windows and trenches have to be
dug in the malodorous mess to reach
the doors. "In the middle of the
street, between the two banks of filth
and offal," writes a correspondent,
"runs a stinking channel which thaws
daily. In it horns, bones and skulls of
various beasts eaten by the Tibetans lie
till the dogs and ravens have picked
them clean enough to be used in the
mortared walls and thresholds. The
stench is fearful. Half decayed corpses
of dogs He cuddlied up with their
mangy but surviving brothers and sis
ters, "who do not resent the ravens. A
curdled and filthy torrent flows through
the market place and half-breed yaks
shove the sore-eyed and mouth-ulcered
children aside to drink at it. The men
and women, clothes and faces alike, are
as black as the peat walls that form
a background to every scene. They

Phari Is 15,000 feet above sea level
and the fearful cold, accentuated often
by an icy, grit-laden north wind, fur
nishes some palliation for this state of
affairs. "Water is obtainable only when
the snow melts. The only available
fuel is dried yak-dung. The acrid,
greasy fumes, of these fires coat the
interiors of the squat hovels with lay
ers of soot which are never removed

It was this that brought that black
bogey of India, the Russian bear, into
the game. Russia and China were
asked to explain. They replied to the
effect that the mission to St. Peters
burg was merely intended to convey
to th*Â» Czar the assurance of the Daila
Lama's distinguished consideration;
that it was absolutely devoid of politi
cal significance, and so on. Russian
denials are mostly construed by the
British Government as incriminating
admissions and what that huge Jelly
fish China says does not count. Lord
Ourzon, as Viceroy of India, saw
visions of Russia's insidious and dan
rcrous encroachments on the Ind'an
frontier.

tains among the loftiest on the globe.
this vast plateau, in extent about eight
times the area of Great Britain, is by
reason of its great altitude, ranging
from 10,000 to 17,000 feet, absolutely de
void of almost everything that civil
ize d man can covet. For the most
part it Is a treeless wilderness of
dreary steppesâ truly a forbidding as
Â¦well as a forbidden land. It is not
worth possessing. What trade could
bÂ» done by Its wretched inhabitants
would not in many years suffice to de
fray the cost of the present expedition.
The pretext" officially put forward for
the expedition is the failure of Tibet
to comply with the treaty obligations
of 1SS3. Three years prior to that
Tibetans raided the Indian vassal state
of Sikkim. A British force drove them
out. Then followed negotiations, not
with Tibet, but with China, which ex
ercises a suzerainty over Tibet. The
result was. some sort of a treaty by
which China, on behalf of Tibetâ Tibet
had no say In the business â agreed
that the restrictions to trade with
India imposed by Tibet snould be re
laxed and a new frontier market
opened. The Tibetans paid little heed
to the treaty. They <3ic open a new
frontier market â on the top of an In
accessible hillâ and laughed over their
Jcke. And in general they continued
to play the leave-me-alone game In the
same old way. So things jogged along
for many years. The ln<JIan Govern
rncnt recognized that the matter was
not worth fussing: about. Then it was
discovered that a Russian agent, Dor-
Eteff, *ho being a Mongolian Buddhist
Â¦5V a 3 not subject to the operations of
the European exclusion set, had estab
lished himself at Lhassa.. Worse than
this the Daila Lama, the sacred Yellow
:Pope of Tibet, dispatched a mission to

The meeting of Ivy Chapter on the

most delightful that this chapter has
held during the current term. The at
tendance of members and of visitors
from every other local chapter, as well
as from chapters across the bay* was
very large, Of. course this was due to
the fact that the officers of Mission
Chapter were on hand to confer the de
gree on a number of strangers for Ivy
Chapter. The Missionites did the work
so well that there was no room for crit
icism other than of the most favorable
nature. .The work of the evening: was
followed by a banquet In the lower hall,
which was served in excellent style
under the direction of a most efficient
committee of ladies under the chair
manship of- Mrs. Norman. . Ivy Chapter
is always preparing novelties and the
unusual event of the officers of another
chapter, while not original in fraternal
work, was novel in this order, and
speaks well for the kindly feeling ex
isting between the members of Mission
and Ivy chapters. . ; : â¢ ?

One of the features of the session
of the Grand Parlor of the . Native
Daughters of the Golden West at Pa
cific Grove was the passage of the
resolution to permit osteopathists to
act as medical examiners for the ad
mission of candidates into snbordinate
parlors. The constitution, which pro
vides that all candidates for member
ship must undergo a medical examina
tion, was not altered. The practition
ers of the regular schools, who have
examined candidates for many years
past, claim that osteopathists cannot
give the medical examination contem
plated by the constitution, on the
ground that they dp not practice, med
icine, simply a particular science. They
have passed the matter up to the grand
president, and there is an intimation
that if osteopathists are permitted to
pass upon candidates for admission
Into the order the regulars will strike
and there will be trouble for the order.
Another feature was the appeal by
Past Grand President Keith to the
Grand Parlor from the decision of
Grand President Finkeldey in 'the'
Alta Parlor case, in which the ap
pellant sought to have expunged
from the records a report affecting her,
which Grand President Finkeldey de
clared to be unfraternal and which,
she said, she would have asked to be
expunged had she the power. This
occupied a great deal of time, * arid,
while the result was not what the ap
pellant expected in her efforts to be
set right, the whole matter was ven
tilated, and it showed up some mem
bers of the order in a very unpleasant
light.
The constitution was amended In a
manner that will prevent a recurrence
of what was declared to be acts of in
justice in the Alta case, many of the
amendments adopted bein? presented"
by Past President Keith. She also pre
sented the first Native . Daughters'
souvenir spoon, which was adopted and
is now In the possession of the founder
of the order. Dr. Amy Florence Tem
ple Tvas appointed chairman of the

To know what you wantâ there's the

But we left him 1n the chorus with
Francis Powers.
"For a year and a half I was with
Powers," the singer told me then.
"After that I went to- Europe to study."
"Dear heaven!" I ejaculated. "And
how did you manage it?"
"Worked my way on a cattle boat to
London, slept on straw for thirteen
days," the basso replied, with oh! such
an unctuous note! "Then on to Italy â
oh, I wanted to go rignt to the foun
tainhcad. I got to Genoa as a sort. of
engineer's steward, a kind of chamber
maid to the engineers, making up beds
and things, and then, Milan."
As the devote says "Mecca," Mr.

"Mahomet," so the singer says "Mor

"And when you got to Genoa?" I

"To Genoa, 175 miles away," the

"How old were you then?"

"What are you going to do?"
"In a year or two I'm going to study
for keeps," he said sturdily, and he
will. "You know a bass voiceâ"
"Profundo," I thundered softly. 'Â¦>'.'_
"A bass voice," he repeated, "does
not mature until you're thirty-five or
fortyâ"
"When you are going to be a de
Reszke?" V
1 "Or a Plancon," he smiled.
"Oh, be a Plancon," I urged.
"All the women like Plancon," the
other basso said, rather impatiently.
"Don't you like his Mefistofele better
than de Reszke's?"
"No," he said, "Plancon's has too lit
tle dignity. It Is too much this kind
of thing'" and the big Scot then as
tonished me by a very, facile, 1 nimble
Imitation of the Frenchman's manner.
"You are Jealous," I charged him.
"Haven't time to be," he laughed.
"When I see a greater artist than I
am, I'm too busy trying to close up the
gap between us to be jealous. But
Plancon to me is like a hod-carrier to
a sculptor In comparison with de
Reszke."
"And is It worth all that?"
"Lord, yes?' the Dunsmure testified?
"There's more to come, too, but not of
that sort."
"Twenty-eight," he supplied.

to Frisco. I came to the Tivoli hereâ

your mind to do anything, really make
up your mind, you can Co anything."
And that has been the Dunsmure
experience* and is the Dunsmure gos
pel. Built on the same big, simple
lines as his body, his desires have con
verged all to one goal, to sing, to sing,
to sing! Trtie, a "little farm well

hammered away at his career as he

with the same solid delight in his

braces (suspenders) woven of threads
of gold instead of the usual elastic
webbing that other men rely upon to
support their trousers. The buckles
were gold too. Everybody know3 that
the private theatrical productions in
which I took part at my estates in
Anglesey were carried out in a mag

done the thing at Vaux in his day. It
costs money to do these things; I took
pleasure in doing things that way."

astonished.
"I am 23 years old. I inherited in

my father, including the estates of Plas

"After 'Rosmersholm' we' must never
say again that Ibsen Is not beautiful.
It is the most heartrending thing I have
ever studied and still its pathos is pure
beauty. Mr. Huneker has said that
Rebecca Is the wickedest woman in the
drama. Yes. But that phase has
passed and the expiation has begun be
fore the play opens. Rebecca Gamvik
is dead and the new birth of Rebecca
West, as the former adventuress Is
known at the Rosmersholm, Is the
theme of the tragedy."
It may be remarked here that Ber
nard Shaw in his "Quintessence of Ib
senlsm" constantly insists upon "the
vital part played in this drama by the
evolution of the lower Into the higher
love."
This fleeting epitome of Rebecca
West's spiritual rebirth was given with
tremendous enthusiasm by Mrs. Fiske:
"Here to me is the most beautiful and
poetic part of 'Rosmersholm.' Rebecca
West has made her wayâ her calm,
unfaltering, ambitious, intrepid way â
through seas of blood. The 'green* be
comes 'one red.' She desires to possess
Rosmer. At last the way Is clear. But
she must be wary. He is a man of ex
quisite sensibility. She must advance
slowly, wait and be still. And as she
wai^s, slowly, gradually, the beauty of
, his character opens the little window of
her soul. (She did not know she had a
soul.) And as she waits and waits, at
last, for the first time in her life, love
comes to her. It is well that Ibsen has
not revealed to us the Rebecca West of
those, days â the days of illumination
and remorse. We could not have en
dured the sight. It is a ghost we see
.when the curtain rises. How can we.
in the presence of this martyr of mar
tyrs among all the stage. women of sor
rows, say again that Ibsen is without
beauty and poetry!"
"They say worse â that he is unneces
sary," was suggested.
She answered In a strange, still tone,
"So, I suppose, are the flowers unneces
sary." ;^'.
"As for Rosmersholm," I dare say I
read it twenty times before the light
began to dawn. To me It is the great
est, the most complex, of Ibsen's works,
and I believe that ultimately Rosmer
and Rebecca will take their place with
Romeo and Juliet, Tristan and Isolde
and Elolse and Abelard as the supreme
figures of trapic love In the dramatic
literature of all ages. The more one
studies 'Rosmersholm' the firmer this
conviction becomes. And I haven't a
doubt that Rebecca will ultimately
stand side by side in the classic reper
tory with Juliet. It may not come to
pass in our day, but it will come, for
the world does not possess a greater
tragedy of expiation than this of Re
becca, who, a perfect Valeria Messa-
Hna in the beginning of her life story,
ultimately Is purified through suffering
and is dead to every impulse save the
desire to serve."
Here again is Mrs. Fiske on "Ros
mershclm," that, with the Maeterlinck
"Monna Vanna," will be the chief pro
ductions of her forthcoming season at
the Manhattan, in New York.
"An Ibsen play deserves one year's
study at the very least," says Mrs.
Fiske. "I have given 'Rosmersholm'
two and do not yet feel ready. There
ought to be a law against the presen
tation of the Norwegian's works with
the hurried, hit-or-miss preliminary
work characteristic of our methods of
theatrical production. But perhaps I
am an extremist in this matter. I
worked six months, for example, on the
one-act play 'Dolce,' which I have
never presented in Chicago, and then
was not satisfied with the result on the
opening night.
pleasantries, piquant sarcasms and
frank protests.
"The pleasantries "concerned mainly
her recent professional tour on the Pa
cific Coast. The animation and gayety
of San Francisco, the beauty of the
bay â which she thought as lovely as
the bay of Naples â the receptivity of
the people â all had charmed her, and
ehe is eager to go thither again. She
was full of the recent experience and
reverted to It * several times, saying
once, 'With what delight I recall that
trip to the coast, and, along with San
Francisco, the beautiful cities of Port
land, Seattle and Tacoma, I cannot for
get the lovely warmth of kindliness â I
cannot forget the charming people.'
"San Frarilsco she thought more like
Paris than any other city she knew of,
and the people seemed to her beauti
fully willing to accept not only with
respect but with enthusiasm certain
newer phases of dramatic art and lit
erature which in certain communities

Nor do the Greenbaum activities end

siderable local Interest will be the pro

entitled "The Star of Bethlehem." The
Greet plans also include an elaborate
production of "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" at one of the local theaters fur

Among the pleasantest musical gos
sip that has floated this way lately is
that Herr Fritz Scheel. who got lost on
his way here last spring, will most
likely be the first of the music-makers
with us this autumn. The local sym
phony lovers were grievously disap
pointed at Mr. Scheel's failure to ap
pear here last March. Hope ran high
among them after the splendid series of
concerts given here by the conductor
at the beginning of last season. The
permanent orchestra seemed an ac
complished fact, the foundations of
such an organization as has made Bos
ton world-famous, and that we shall
surely have here some day, however
far, securely laid. The March series of
concerts was to clinch the matter. It
was to be the second half of a trium
phant season. But, like the male mos
quito, that doesn't bite, there wasn't
any. If the rumor of the present sea
son be correct, Mr. Scheel will be here
in August.
"Yes," he nodded weightily.
Then he heaved round my way to
A self-mad* manâ and, like another
pood workman, proud of his Jobâ Is
John Dunsrnure, basso profundo of the
Tivoli for the moment and former
member of the Eostonians. There is no
reason why "kittle John" should not
be proud of his handiwork. 'TIs no

of a Meamer and sung for a meal and

?"inp to he interviewed. So in a very
business-like way _he suggested that
th^ way hÂ« got his education was the
most interesting thing about him. As
that nai just what I wanted to know, I
; ;-k'i .the basso to tell about it. But
first I had asked him, forgetting, where
1. had seen and heard Mr. Dunsmure
b< lore.
"Why." that gentleman protested,
turning a big. boyish, hurt face to me,
'1 was with the Bostonians five y # ears
agro here as Will Scarlett. Then I was
here with Miss Glaser in 'Doily Var
den.'"
"Oh, yes, I remember," I consoled
him, "as Fairfax â 'Guardy,' as Dolly
Varden called you."
"And I've Just closed the season with
her," he added. "It is not a good part,
Fairfax, though. It is simply a 'feeder'
to Dolly Varden all through the piece.
You can't do anything â you remember
when I have a duet with Miss Glaser
and she goes out at the close? People
simply sigh there, turn over the pro

>*ow here's a part in Scarlett, hardly
a sixth as long, and look how com

"But Miss Glaser," I suggested, "I
should think it would be fun to be with
her if your part were twice as long and
half as dry again?"
. "She*F a great girl." Mr. Dunsmure
testified. The laugh that lifted the cor
ners of his mouth said more than his
words. "She's a Dolly Varden off the
Etage as well as on, quick as lightning
and full of fun- She'd rather, you
know, break me up in my part than

audience. Changing her cues, for ex

"And what do you do then?"
"Just look as wise as you know how.
and catch on as you best can," the
Einger put it. Then with ponderous
gayety â it takes some time to set all of
six fe?t one and three-quarters a-laugh
â he chuckled.
"But it was not always that way.
Sometimes we arranged little surprises
for Miss Glaser. Once, where Dolly and
her lover are looking into the distance
for the return of 'Guardy,' and ehe has
to say 'There comes Guardy. Perhaps
.that's a clergyman with him and we
can be married.' I fixed up one of the
â¢Etage hands as a clergyman. But such
a clergyman! I painted his nose blue,
his eyebrows green and put on him a
pair of red sluggers. Then I put my
hat on himâ it's not a little one â and
drowned him in my frock coat. We
tucked the property Bible under his
arm. too. Wien she saw himâ in the

on the stage and hollered 'murder!'â
and she wouldn't have remembered her
lines to this day if the lover hadn't
told her.' 4
"What did Ehe do when she came
off?" I asked.
"Gave me a good kick," Mr. Dflns
mure laiighed.
Then he reminlscently stroked his
giant shin 'and ordained: "But that's
not for publication, of course."
"Of course not," I said.
"But," Mr. Dunsmure advised then,
in his deepest profundo, "I think the

most interesting material to you. I've
had rather a unique career.''

The week recorded some attractive
weddings. There were the Frank-

both of which were well appointed
home weddings, and that of Captain
Edgar H. Fry, the popular officer of
the Thirteenth Infantry, and Miss Mary
2.!aus, whose nuptials were celebrated
at Fort Riley. Kan.
The wedding at the Hecht home was
chaiarlerized by o.uiet elegance. The
bride, who by the way shares with her
staters the Hecht type of beauty and
style, was very attractive in her trap
pings of bliss.
As would be expected, Mrs. Mark
Gerstle was one of the most fascinat
ing women present. She possesses the
singer, the verve, if you please, that
differentiates her from the average so
ciety woman. Besides, she is clever.
Her talent at vaudeville has often
been the topic of public comment.
The young bride will go to her Bal
timore home, after a journey through
the southland.
The Hellman home became a minia
ture forest for the festive affair of
Thursday. Palms spread their grace
ful fronds over the lower floor, mak

clubs passed through the county, on

blocked the way of the motorists. The
cars puffed 1 and the drivers expressed
their desire to get hold of the agri

were passed. No legal action can be

gravel outrage because the farmers

Telegrams from Liaoyang agree that

The close of active operations in

fcT. LOUIS, July 2.â All the men who
will decide the Presidential, contest
have not yet appeared in the conven
tion city, but among those who are
here there seems to be a conviction that
Judge Alton B. Parker will be nom
inated early in the balloting. His most
radical supporters claim that he will be
named on the first ballot, while others
say that favorite sons â¢ must be first
complimented before the necessary
two-thirds will vote for him. A claim
that will not be disputed in authorita
tive quarters is that Parker will have
a good majority on the first ballot from
States which will compel speedy recog
nition in the convention.
The arrival of the^alifornia and
other delegations from the West which
are under instructions to vote for
Hearst stirred the atmosphere early in
the ddy, and there was some specula
tion as to what strength, Hearst actu
ally had in the convention. The claim
of the Hearst managers of more than
one-third of the delegates, with power
sufficient to prevent the selection of
any candidate not" satisfactory â¢ to
Hearst, Is not seriously considered by
friends of Parker. The Hearst men
have decided to have tests of strength
before the platform Is voted upon, and
will force a vote by putting forward a
candidate for permanent chairman.
GORMAN KEEPS UNDER COVER.
During the day there has been talk
of Cleveland, Gorman, Olney and'Har
mon. It seems to be understood that
Ohio intends to cast a complimentary
vote for Harmon and that Parker will
then get the delegation, with the pro
viso ; that Gorman's appearance as an
active candidate '- would materially
change the conditions. The only really
active and positive Gorman force at St.
Louis now Is' Henry G. Davis, former
Senator from West Virginia, and he is
not sure that Gorman will be a candi
date. It is not even known whether
Gorman wfll attend . the ; convention.
Something was expected ' to develop
about, Gorman's position upon the ar
rival of James M. Guffey, but the Penn
sylvania leader - did . not say anything
that Indicated that the Maryland Sen
ator would be a factor in the Presi
dential race.
Now and then there is a mention of
It is apparent that quite a number of
delegates are smarting under Instruc
tions for favorite sons. They feel that
they are being debarred from taking
part in the making of a Presidential
candidate unless there should bÂ« a
prolonged struggle.
There was increased activity to
night, caused by the arrival of prom
inent New Yorkers, headed by former
Senators Hill and Murphy.
. Quite an effort has been made to cre
ate the impression that William F.
Sheehan, and not Hill, is the real rep
resentative of Parker. This is for the
purpose of meeting the frequent charge
that Parker is "Hill's man." But the
arrival of Hill and the many calls made
upon him Indicate that he is at least
the political head of the Parker move
ment.
While the Presidential situation Is
the most Interesting feature of the
ante-convention days, the platform is
a subject of debate and serious consid
eration. Many suggestions have al
ready been made, but no one can say
which will meet with the most favor.
Some of the delegates believe the plat
form will engender the greatest con
test of the convention.

Former Senator Hill, former Senator

arrived here this evening. En route
they had decided upon a policy and
their decision means adoption by the
New York State delegation on Tuesday
despite Tammany opposition, because
Hill and those already here with him
control by two-thirds.
Former United States Senator Hill
will be on the committee on resolu
tions; former Lieutenant Governor
William P. Sheehan on the committee
on credentials; former United States
Senator Edward Murphy will cast the
seventy-eight votes of New York State
for Alton B. Parker and a sound money
plank; Norman E. Mack will be na
tional committeexnan.
No decision was reached on the ques
tion of a tariff declaration. Senator
Hill believes that the plank should be
tariff for revenue only, but he falls to
get equally as ardent representatives
of Judge Parker as, for Instance. Wil
liam F. .Sheehan and Jacob A. Cantor
to agree with him. They contend that
the plank should be as nearly like the
Republican plank as it can consistently
be, for the smaller manufacturers
throughout the country will vote
against any platform not containing a
promise of protection for them.
Senator Hill during the day ex
pressed the belief that Judge Parker
would be chosen on the second ballot,
if not on the first.
There Is a growing belief amon;

A striking feature of the last

Several thousand soldiers will use the
mails to make application to be.regis
tered, and as the available supply of
responsible- "dummies" is, ; limited to a
few hundred at the most, It will be seen
that the soldier who does not appear in
person is taking a chance. . .
OMAHA, July 2.â The soldier who
wants to make sure of his chance to
register for a piece of land in the Rose
bud reservation must personally ap
pear at one of the registration points.
The reason for this is that as the day
for the opening of the registration
draws near the demand for "dummies"
to represent the soldier, as authorized
by the President's proclamation, has
become so strong that the price paid
has advanced from a reasonable fee of
{1 to as high*as $15, and in some 'cases
even higher. The fees have been paid,
with the result that in many cases
"dummies" engaged by or for one vet
eran have been switched off, and the
first comer has been betrayed. ,
According to the President's procla
mation a soldier may delegate an agent
to appear for him by a power of attor
ney, but that agÂ«nt can appear for one
soldier only. Early in the game a num
ber of locating agents at Bohesteel and
other points on the edge of the reser
vation secured lists of "soldiers' dum
mies."' Each dummy was paid $L for
which he was to register for the soldier
and later file on the land drawn.
Several hundred of these "dummies"
were easily secured in and around
Bonesteel, but more than 1000, apllca
tions have been received, and It is this
boom in the business which makes the
soldiers' registration a matter of con
siderable doubt. On Friday hangers-on
at the dance halls were secured at a fee
of 92 50. Saturday other locating agents
purchased the services of the same per
sons for $5. In the afternoon of the
same day many of them charged a still
larger fee.

DECISIVE BATTLE NEAR.
It is declared that 32,000 troops are
engaged in guarding railroad com

scarcity of troops at the disposition
of General Kuropatkin prevents his
taking active steps against the enemy.
The possible fall of Port Arthur Is
considered to be of less importance
than the guarding of railroad com

BERLIN, July 3. â The Nord
Deutsche Allegemeine Zeitung, in an
article on King Edward's visit, empha
hizes the indirect political value of the
meeting between the. King and the
Emperor at Kiel, but denies that any
agreement concerning special ques
tions was either designed or made.
The National Zeitung assumes that
the war in the Far East was the cen
tral point of all the discussions. The
paper argues that Great Britain and
Germany are equally interested in the
early restoration of peace; that the
war must injure trade and that the
time must ultimately come when the
Chinese will compel the Government
to participate. Consequently, the Zei
tung says, no patriotic Englishman
can desire the complete humiliation of
Russia.
The Tageblatt says It is informed
that the supreme efforts of the diplo
matists who are working quietly
toward the bringing about of inter
vention between Russia and Japan
will be directed to the prevention of a
division of the powers into two camps,
as occurred a decade ago. It is de
sired that intervention shall be a united
action on the part of all the neutral
great powers and It will be restricted
to a tender of good offices without th'e
slightest- tinge of compulsion. The
chances of such intervention is; con
sidered to be not at all unfavorable.

BIG BATTLE REPORTED.
CHEFU, July 2.â It has been learned
here that a big battle was fought on
land near Port Arthur on June 26 and
June 27. The Japanese were success
ful and on the morning of the 28th they
occupied certain heights within ten
miles of Port Arthur. The First Jap
anese Division, which suffered so heav
ily at the battle of Nanshan Hill, and
the Eleventh Division, fresh from Ja
pan, were engaged. The Japanese
losses have not been learned, but the
Russians are said to have suffered
very heavily.
Refugees who left Port Arthur yes
terday and who have arrived here de
clare that wounded Russians were be
ing brought in by the hundred.
Other refugees from Pigeon Bay as
sert that hundreds of wounded Rus
sian soldiers were passing near the
bay, being transported in various
kinds of conveyances.
The fact that Russian wounded were
seen at Pigeon Bay, which is due west
of Port Arthur, would indicate that
the Japanese have advanced along the
east and west coasts of the peninsula
at the same time.
The two divisions which attacked
Port Arthur were composed of 40,000
men and an independent artillery
corps.
As a matter of precaution the Jap
anese have landed a division of 10,000
men on one of the Elliott group of isl
ands, and on June 28 they landed the
Sixth Division of 20,000 men at Kerr
Bay. These two divisions can be used
to reinforce General Oku's army near
Xalpino:, on the west side of the Liao
tung Peninsula and about forty miles
south of Newchwang, or the army un
der General Nozu before Port Arthur.
During the present week three large
and a number of smaller transports
have arrived at Port Dalny with an in
dependent artillery" corps, heavy siege'
guns and provisions for the Eleventh
Division.
HEAVY FIRING AT SEA.
Foreigners who have reached here
from Port Arthur and Japanese from
Port Dalny agree as to the success of
the Japanese on land, and from the
stories brought in by Junk men it would
appear that the Japanese have at least
good prospects of being successful at
sea. Junk men who have arrived from
Port Dalpy say they heard heavy fir
ing all day yesterday and until noon
to-day, while Junk men who have come
from Port Arthur report that a por*
It is believed the Japanese lost an
opportunity for attacking Liaoyang or
cutting the Russian lines of communi
cation. The rains render it imperative
to suspend operations.
A complete change of plans was dis
played by the Japanese on Friday in
retiring upon Hoichan. General
Keller in the meantime had been re
inforced by artillery and he harassed
the Japanese rear. Owing to the heavy
rains the movements of the guns and
transport wagons were exceedingly
difficult.
LIAOYANG.- July 2. â The Japanese
Guards division, which was engaged
in the attack on DaliivPass, is retiring
eastward and General Count Keller,
who has been reinforced, is following
up the Japanese.
A correspondent who has Just re
turned from the headquarters of
Count Keller's corps reports that on
Wednesday a Japanese division ad
vanced by a tortuous defile about
thirty miles east of Liaoyang. General
Keller had no artillery posted, but had
stationed three battalions of Infantry
along a crest commanding, the pass.
An obstinate fight followed and lasted
the whole night. The Russians lost
fifty men and the Japanese casualties
were larger. On Thursday morning
General Keller retired successfully,
withdrawing his men from the narrow
defiles.

A dispatch from Tokio. dated June

official, but it said that Chikwanshan,
Chitanshan and Sochoshan. three forts
on the southeast line of the Port Ar

Japanese on Sunday, June 26,^ after an
all-day fight, which began with an ar

taken the Russians retreated west

The number of their wounded was not
learned. The Japanese lost three offi

captured two guns and a quantity of
ammunition.
In conclusion, the Tokio correspond

tion of the Japanese fleet was off Port
Arthur last night. These two reports
indicate that a portion of the Japanese
fleet has engaged the enemy at sea,
while the remainder returned to Port
Arthur to cut off the retreat of the
Russian warships should retreat be
found necessary.
Foreigners who left Port Arthur yes
terday evening confirm the reports
brought by Chinese that there are only
four large Russian warships at Port
Arthur.

The Russky Invalid, the army organ,

simply a demonstration made for the

SEOUL, Korea, July 2.â The Japan
ese legation has received reports from
semi-official sources on the east coast
of an engagement yesterday between
the Vladivostok squadron and a Jap
anese squadron under command of
Vice Admiral Kamimura. No details
are obtainable. The authorities are en
deavoring to confirm the 'report.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 2. â Noth
ing- Is known here of the report that a
fight has taken place between the
Vladivostok squadron and the Japan
ese squadron commanded by Vice Ad
miral Kamimura.
LONDON, July 2. â According to a
dispatch from Tokio to the Central
News, only three cruisers of the Vlad
ivostok squadron appeared in Tsu Isl
and chaneel and the torpedo-boats be
longing to the squadron had apparent
ly returned to Vladivostok.
Heavy cannonading was heard ashore
at 8:30 yesterday evening, the dispatch
says, but the nature and result of the
fight are not known. The Russian
ships, however, seem to have suffered
no damage, as they were afterward
seen making in a northeasterly direc
tion.
Kamimura's scouts discovered the
Russians yesterday afternoon, trailed
them and reported the Russians* pres
ence. . At 7:30 o'clock in the evening
the Russians were seen between Iki
and Tsu islands. Cannonading was
heard there. An hour and a half later
cannonading was heard farther north.
The Nary Department expresses the
belief that Kaminura sent his torpedo
boats against the Russians during the
nigrht.
The object of the recent Russian na
val movements is not clearly under
stood here. It Is suspected that both
Russian squadrons hope to seek refuge
in a neutral port of China and claim
protection. Kaichou, Chefu and even
"Weihaiwei are mentioned as their des
tination.
The Japanese contend that the Rus
eians are not entitled to neutral pro
tection under the circumstances. They
deny that the case Is similar to that of
the Russian gunboat Mandjur, which
was at Shanghai when hostilities com
menced. The entry of the Russian
Â¦warships into either Kaichou or Wei
haiwei would prove embarrassing to
the Governments which control these
ports.
TOKIO, July 2. â There is a probabil
ity that Vice Admiral Kamimura
lighted the Vladivostok squadron last
niRht and that a general attack with
torpedo-boats followed. It Js known
that Kamimura is pursuing the Rus
sians and cannonading "was heard, Ka
mimura has not yet reported to Toklo
and word from him is awaited with
keen eagerness. The exact movements
of the Russians axe not known. It is
thought Kamimura pressed the Rus
sians into the Straits of Korea- and
that the Russians ran east and then
north in an effort to escape.
TOKIO, July 3, 5:30 a. m: â Infor

"In the face of such grave facts, we
think an 'Indignant denial' will not suf
fice to save the Japanese honor. We
have reason to believe that the Japa
nese massacre and mutilate the wound
ed, but treat well for the eyes of Eu
rope those remaining after the massa
cres.
TONGUES CUT OUT.
"A simple denial Is not exculpation.
We do not deny that our wounded are
well treated at Sasebo and other Jap
enese cities where well-organized hos
pitals are operated under the eyes of
Europe, but on the field of battle, when
the Russians are forced to abandon the
wounded, a cruel fate awaits them, as
their agonized cries there cannot be
heard in Europe.
LIAOYANG. July 2. â The Russians
assert that photographs taken prove
that the Japanese are killing- the
wounded. Lieutenant Chita, it is said,
who was wounded near Siuyen, June
26, and who was left on the field, was
wounded thrice afterward by Japanese.
The Russian soldiers are furious at
this wanton crueltv. They also claim
that the Japanese use foul language In
approaching the Russians.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 2. â The
Journal de St. Petersburg, the semi
official organ of the Foreign- Office,
printed this morning one of its Infre
quent editorial articles dealing with
official denial by the Japanese Govern
ment of the reports of the mutilation
of Russian wounded. The article says:
recourse to reprisals, which would be
against every instinct of our nation."
WASHINGTON. July 2. â Takahira.
the Japanese Minister, had a long
conference with Secretary Hay re
specting the published Russian allega
tions of cruel treatment of wounded
Russians by Japanese soldiers. The
Minister addressed himself to Secre
tary Hay because the latter had as
sumed the charge of Japanese in
terests in Russia. It Is said, how
ever, that neither Secretary Hay nor
Minister Takahira % had received any
official communication -on this subject
aud the discussion was preliminary to
a more formal exchange when the ex
pected Russian protest is forthcoming.
Some military experts here believe the
Russians have been misled by the
frightful effects of the Japanese shells.
If the Russian complaint is properly
supported it will be duly presented to
the Japanese Government by Secre
tary Hay.

CHEFU, July 2. â Affairs are reach-
Ing a crisis at Port Arthur. The few
foreigners remaining at Port Arthur,
with the exception of several who are
under suspicion, have been ordered to

excursions to sea. One torpedo-boat,
it is claimed, has succeeded In making
three trips to Ylnkow and it is re
ported that on her last trip Admiral
SkrydlcJC was taken to Port Arthur
on her.
A number of Junks, laden with fresh
provisions, have succeeded in passing
the Japanese blockading fleet, one
junk landing 5000 sacks of flour. A
cargo of coal is said to have been
landed.
Chinese who arrived to-day say the
Japanese have Increased their block
ading fleet to forty vessels.
Foreigners who have arrived from
Port Arthur say that since the disas
ter to the battleship Petropavlovsk the
Russian fleet has sustained no dam
age beyond the. seven-foot hole In the
battleship Sevastopol, which has al
ready been repaired. They claim to
know nothing: of a vessel previously
reported ashore southeast of Llaoshan
promontory.

ST. LOUIS, July 2. â The committee
on arrangements of the Democratic

unanimously to recommend to the full
convention the selection of John
Sharp Williams of Mississippi for the

will refrain from opposing him. It is
insinuated by some that harmony may
be accomplished by promising the nom
ination for Governor of New York
State to Leader Murphy of Tammany
for Mayor McClellan or some other
person of his choosing.
One of the significant movements of
the Xew York State delegation is the
promise to let Norman K. Mack suc

man, while advocating a sound money
plank. Mack was a stanch Bryan man
and a silverite in two campaigns. His
selection is believed to mean that there

further, that the original Bryan sup

Michigan, whose name was presented
by Campau, only to be withdrawn..
Williams was suggested by Head of
Tennessee and the nomination was
seconded by Guffey of Pennsylvania.
The committee also decided upon
M. W. Blumenburg. one of the of
ficial reporters of the United States
Senate, for the office of reporter of
the proceedings of the convention,
and upon Frank Brust of Chicago for
chief doorkeeper. " . V
Campau made a report on the con
dition of the convention hall, saying
that while the committee had hoped
to secure control of lt two weeks ago,
it had not yet come into possession.
There was, however, no doubt that the
committee would be in control by
Monday. He told the committee that
the decorations would be of pleasing
effect. He also notified the commit
tee that the admission tickets had
been prepared, and said that he would
turn them over to the members from.

President. Parker said to-day:
"In case Bryan and Hearst bolt the
St. Louis convention the People's party
would nominate either for President,
but this is not likely. I believe either
Watson or Judge Williams will be
nominated."
KENTUCKY FAVORS WATSON.
Hopes, However, That Bryan and
Hearst Will Bolt at St. Louis.
LOUISVILLE. July 2.â The State
convention of the People's party of
Kentucky to-day selected delegates
to the national convention at Spring
field, 111. The delegation will vote for
Thomas E. Watson of Georgia for the
nomination for President If he will
accept it In case he refuses Judge
Samuel Williams of Indiana will
likely receive its support, and the
Kentucky delegates probably will offer
Delmas, who will represent Califor
nia on. the. most Important, committee,
that, on platform and resolutions, said
this evening:
"My mind is as yet unsettled as to
the position I will take regarding any
suggestions that may be made in refer
ence to tariff, labor or governmental
expansion; but one great issue has
crystallized in my mind and regarding
it I will make known my views. This
that I would make an issue is the ques
tion of the development of the great
empire that lies between the Missouri
River on the east and the California
border on the west.
"Here lies a territory rich in fertility
of soil and rich in natural resources.
Millions of acres await the coming of
the husbandman. Here the innumera
ble host of China could dwell uncrowd
ed and blessed by plenty. The Govern
ment should follow the trend of settle
ment toward the West. We of San
Francisco, dwelling at the western
ramparts of the nation, know, the fu
ture that awaits us, but we alone are
informed. That our undeveloped em
pire may advance the quicker to give
Its sturdy strength to the nation, the
nation should extend its helping hand."
In acknowledgment of his services
on behalf of Hearst, California's in
structed delegation will present to the
convention the name of M. F. Tarpey
for confirmation as Democratic na
tional committeeman for California. D.
M. Delmas, who will place Hearst in
nomination, has been selected to repre
sent the delegation on the committee
on platform and resolutions; D. W.
Carmichael will serve on the committee
on rules and order of business; John A.
Hicks on the committee on permanent
organization; R. H. DeWltt will notify
the nominee for President; Edward I.
Coffey will perform a similar function
in reference to the nominee for Vice
President, and Joseph Simon will be
named honorary vice chairman.
Louis H. Mooser of San Francisco,
alternate, who will represent Jasper
McDonald, and W. J. McGee are not
on any committees. Their affection
for Gavin McNab, it is announced, will
insure for. them a seat away back.
DELMAS FINDS AN* ISSUE.
ocracy. While the general principles
of those platforms might be reaffirmed
with safety and with profit to the
party. It does not seem to me to be
necessary to refer in derail to the is
sues we have nailed our standard to in
the past. It is quite unnecessary. for
one to repeat the litany every time he
says his prayers. However, these ques
tions will be determined by the col
lective genius of the party after it as
sembles In convention.
Parker Will Remain at Home.
KINGSTON, N. Y., July 2. â Judge
Alton B. Parker will not attend the
National Democratic Convention at St.
Louis. He will remain at Rosemont,
his home.
ST. LOUIS. July 2.â For the first time
Einee the delegates to the approaching
Democratic Convention began to col
lect in this city a movement looking to
united action on the part of the anti-
Parker forces was instituted to-day,
and Senator Stone, chairman of the
Missouri delegation, stood sponsor for
It. He appears as the champion of his
colleague. Senator Cockrell, and was In
conference several times during the
day with leaders of what Is known as
the Bryan element and with represent
atives of Hearst, Gorman and other
possible candidates.
No details of these meetings were ob
tainable and Senator Stone refused to
discuss them. He talked freely, how
ever, cf the necessity of united action,'
saying: \
"It Is evident that Mr. Parker will
enter the convention with the votes of
a majority of the thousand delegates,
and any responsible man should be able
to see that if there is not an under
standing among the opposing delega
tions he is likely to secure the two
thirds vote necessary to nominate as
Foon as his strength is made manifest.
I do not believe that two-thirds of the
delegates ore naturally favorable to
Mr. Parker, and. so believing. I think
his defeat can be accomplished. In
that event I think Senator Cockrell's
availability will become so evident as
to cause the convention .to take him up
and give him the nomination."
SEEK TO PLACATE BRYAX.
Members of the Missouri delegation
express no personal aversion to Judge
I'arker, but they say that his candi
dacy would greatly weaken the ticket
in this State, largely because of Bryan's
opposition to him. The candidate of
1896 and 11*00 has many followers in the
State, and as the claim is made that it
would be unsafe to name a man who
vould not be sure of Bryan's cordial
support
The movers for the consolidation of
the opposition forces are meeting with
some difficulty in getting their follow
ers together, but it is claimed that this
trouble is due to the absence of most
of the delegates. They are working
hard and hope to succeed.
Connected somewhat with this move
ment is an effort which was set on foot
during the day to secure the attend
ance of Senator Gorman at the con
vention. Notwithstanding he Is a dele
gate, he has decided to remain away,
unless his presence should be consid
ered desirable and he is determined to
he governed by the adxice of ex-Sena
tor Davis, of West Virginia on this
point. Davis was in conference to-day
with ex-Serator Jones of Arkansas,
Senator Stone of Missouri, John T. Mc-
Graw of West Virginia and others, and
they recommended that Davis advise
Gorman to come immediately to this
city. Davis, however, would not sum
mon the Senator.
GORMAN'S ADVICE NEEDED.
*l"he reason given for wishing Gor
man's presence is the desire to have
his counsel in unraveling the tangled
Fkein of political thread which the
leaders find to exist, and this is suffl
rier.t cause. Still It is impossible to
disguise the fact that there is a con
siderable element in the convention
which holds the opinion that the Mary-
Jand leader is the most desirable man
to head the ticket. They hope that the
psychological moment of his ascend
ancy may arrive and they believe that
at such a time his presence would be
of jrreat advantage.
"The Indiana delegation will put up
a winning fi?ht for Thomas Taggart
for National Chairman." said Major G.
V. Menzies. delegate at large from that
State to-night. "Mr. Tagg-arfs selec
tion in no wise depends upon the nomi
nation of Judge Parker. Mr. Taggart
will be chairman, no matter what the
result of the convention balloting may
be. We have assurances of support
from many other States and I am con
fident of Mr. Taggart's success."
Taprsart refused to discuss the chair
manship. He declared bis belief that
Judge Parker would be nominated.
"He would be chosen on the first bal
lot if it were not for the favorite sons,"
said he, "and as it stands to-night he
will certainly win on the second bal
lot."
IX)R PERMANENT CHAIRMAN'.
Four possible candidates for the posi
tion of permanent chairman of the con
vention are mentioned tc-night. They
are Delegate Barksworth of Michigan,
Patrick Collins of Massachusetts, Da
vid S. Rose of Wisconsin and Champ
Clark of Missouri.
The friends of Hearst sprang Clark's
rame at a conference held late to-day,
and their avowed reason for taking him
vp was to prevent the selection of a
presiding officer friendly to Judge Park
er. They express determined opposi
tion to conceding the temporary and
permanent chairmanship to the Parker
element. Some of the Hearst men are,
however, quite content to accept Barks
worth, claiming that he is unfriendly
to the New York Judge.
There was considerable discussion of
Barksworths availability in the meet
ing of the committee on arrangements
to-day, and the well-informed say that
his name will not be withdrawn from
the contest for temporary chairman
until some assurance of his selection to
the other place had been received by
his friends. He Is understood to have
had the promise of the support of five
of the ten members of the committee,
and only his withdrawal made certain
Williams' selection for the temporary
position.
Objection Is made to Clark on the
ground that he, like Williams, repre
sents a Southern State.
Liner Ashore Below Sorel.
MONTREAL, July 2.â The Dominion
Line ' steamship Vancouver, bound
from Liverpool, went ashore sixty miles
below Sorel early this morning. She
had about 300 passengers on board.
The vessel was not injured and tugs
have been sent to her assistance.
ST. LOUIS, July 2. â Hoke Smith of
Georgia, who was Secretary of the In
terior under President Cleveland and
who was the leader of the Parker
movement in the "Cracker State,"
represents a certain sentiment that is
quite prevalent in some sections. He
is for Parker and will support him as
long as there is a possibility of his
nomination. That is the attitude of
the Georgia delegation, but in case it
becomes evident that Parker cannot
be nominated then Georgia has a ma
jority which would vote the whole
delegation for Cleveland.
"Of course," said Smith, "my pref
erence for Mr. Cleveland is well
known and I would be glad to see him
nominated, but we are honorably
committted to Judge Parker. When
Hearst attempted to capture the State
the conservative men, under a call is
sued by me. met and determined to
send a Parker delegation to the con
vention. That was done and Georgia
will remain true to him as long as he
Is In the field. I expect to see him
nominated early in the balloting and
his selection would be perfectly satis
factory to Georgia."
Smith wanted it understood that
there was nothing lukewarm in Geor
gia's support of Parker and it was
only in case of the break-up of which
there has been so much talk that
Georgia would consider another
choice.
GEORGIA LIKES CLEVELAND.
ST. LOUJS, July 2. â There was a
conference to-night between former
Senator Harry G. Davis of West Vir
ginia and James M. Guffey of Penn
sylvania, the object of Senator Davis
being to enlist the Pennsylvania leader
for Gorman. It is believed that Guffey
feels that Gorman is out and that his
delegation from a Republican State
cannot afford to oppose what seems
to be the choice of Democratic States
and that .when the Pennsylvania dele
gation meets it will decide to vote for
Parker.
The arrival of many, leaders and
delegates to-night seems to make it
plain that former President Cleveland
is not considered by them. What Is
called "the Cleveland scare" has re
sulted In solidifying the Parker
strength.
Former Senator Hill authorizes the
statement that he- would not be a can
didate for chairman of the committee
on resolutions.
"New York." he said, "has a candi
date for President and is not seeking
any other honors from the conven
tion."
The first day's session, after effecting
temporary organization and the. ap
pointment of committees, will resolve
itself into a Fourth of July celebration-
Former United States Senator William
V. Allen of Nebraska will make the
principal address. As far as heard from
there are no contests to be decided.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., July 2. â Former
Congressman Thomas E. Watson of
Georgia, who was Bryan's running mate
on the People's party ticket In 1896,
will not have the Presidential nomina
tion by the National Convention of the
People's party, which will meet In this
city next Monday, offered to him as a
gift. In fact, there seems to be good
prospects of a lively contest for first
place on the ticket.
From members of the National Com
mittee and other leading Populists who
have arrived for the convention, lt
seems that former United States
Senator William V. Allen of Ne
braska may prove a strong can
didate, though his State took
no action toward Indorsing him. Oth
ers who are spoken of as candidates
for the nomination are Samuel A. Wil
liams of Vincennes, Ind., who was in
dorsed by the Allied People's party, or
middle-of-the-road faction, in the In
diana State Convention, and S. II.
Pierson of Parkersburg, W. Va., who
was Indorsed by the same faction of
the party In the West Virginia State
Convention.
Among those mentioned In connec
tion with the nomination for Vice Pres
ident is L. H. Weller of Nashua, Iowa,
Indorsed by the middle-of-the-road
faction of that State, the fusion wing
having been assimilated by the Demo
cratic party. The leader of the fusion
wing. General James B. Weaver, heads
the Democratic delegation to the Na
tional Convention. Others mentioned
are: National Commltteeman T. P.
Rynder. Erie, Pa.; George Fred Wil
liams of Massachusetts, though he is a
Democrat; E. Garry Brown, editor of a
labor paper at Brockton, Mass., and
one of the original Populists of Massa
chusetts, and John Breidenthal of
Kansas, candidate of the People's par
ty for Governor in 1900.
The convention will virtually have
two presiding officers when called to
order on Monday. Hon. J. Edmoniston
of Nebraska will call the fusion branch
of the convention to order, if he be
present, which Is doubtful. In case he
be not, J. A. Parker of Louisville. Ky..
chairman of the National Committee
of the Allied People's party, or middle
of-the-roaders, will be presiding officer.
Parker will be on the platform in either
event.
"Turning from candidates to issues,
it is my opinion that they should be
left to the .committee on platform and
resolutions. Any effort to secure re
affirmatioa of the financial planks of
the last two platforms would not meet
with my approval. < The people of the
United States have been given an op
portunity in two elections to record
their views on this question and they
have done it with disaster to the Dem-
FREE SILVER DEAD ISSUE.
As soon as he had gathered the faith
ful about him. Chairman Tarpey pre
pared to inject large and undiluted
doses of Alameda politics into the na
tional situation. He divided his forces
into bands, dignified ea^h with the
title of sub-committee, and sent them
out to arrange for the stampede for
William Randolph Hearst.
These sub-committees are not handi
capped by the modesty of their claims.
All day long they have been blanching
the cheeks of Eastern correspondents
with figures that show the end of
Parker, the extinction of Gorman, the
Waterloo of Cleveland and the finis of
Olney. Into the ears of arriving dele
gates they have poured the oft- told
tale. By next Monday, with such prac
tice, they will begin to believe it them
selves.
After a second meeting, called to
enable the sub-committees to report
progress, Tarpey said:
"I find that the Parker boom is but
a bubble that upon investigation
bursts. I am very much encouraged
by the trend of sentiment and am con
fident Mr. Hearst will receive 400 votes
on the first ballot. I am aware of the
fact that the Parker people claim
enough votes to nominate two men for
President, but I think that when we
get into the convention they will flnd
tbey have been deluding themselves
and that the New York Jurist will fail
of nomination.

HEADQUARTERS CALIFORNIA
DELEGATION, ST. LOUIS, July 2.â
The weather is delightful. It Is as
serted in various quarters that the ar
rival of the California delegation had
a refrigerating effect upon the climate,
but this statement may not be accept
ed as absolute fact. It Is hardly prob
able that the elements would yield to
an influence no human here has felt
as yet i
The delegation arrived here this
morning at 9:30 o'clock, the special cars
that carried it from the West consti
tuting the tail end of the regular Bur
lington express from Kansas City.
Like the "West of Missouri" candi
dates. M. F. Tarpey expected to escort
Into St. Louis under the Hearst stand
ard, the â¢ locomotive that hauled the
delegation special from the coast got
sidetracked somewhere. The result was
a disturbance of calculations that up
set any secret plans, that may have
existed to receive the delegation. The
Californians were compelled to search
out headquarters unaided. By/ 11
o'clock a majority of them had arrived
at the Jefferson Hotel, some footsore
from the walk from the station, others
complaining of the car service and yet
others the victims of businesslike cab
men.

The station at Oyster Bay, which had

thronged with people. As the train
stopped the crowd cheered . enthu

gathering received him uncovered, hun
dreds waving flags. Through a space
which had been roped off the President,
bowing right and left to scores in the
crowd whom he recognized, was escort

shaking.
- At the carriage the President met
Mrs. Roosevelt and his^ children, who
had driven from Sagamore Hill to join
his welcome home. The Oyster Bay
Roosevelt Club marched to the station
headed by a band arid participated in
the greeting, but as the demonstration
was purely non-partisan the club took
no further action. The band played
"Hail to the Chief" as the President
entered his carriage, and a party of
men in a field near the station fired
giant crackers and small braes cannon
in noisy welcome.

Roosevelt's homecoming was made the

By some means they managed to ob

be kept until an arrangement was
made for their reception at Sandring

ever, they were sent to Buckingham

ThÂ« servants were at their wits' end

secured in cages.

The attitude of the Liberal leaders In
the House of Commons In desiring the
retention of Balfour In power grows
out of their opposition to Lord Spencer,
th* LJberal leader in the House of
Lords, who, in case the government re-

be the new Premier. Moreover, they
do not wish at the present time to un

was perfect In every respect. The
Nicolaus boIFer, about which there has
been eo much controversy, performed
its functions admirably. The model of
the ship is so excellent that at the top
speed there was a remarkable absence
of waves both at the bow and at the
stern- Another noticeable feature of
the trial was the entire absence of vi
bration at all speeds. The results al
together show the Colorado to be with
out a peer in the American or any
other navy."
The weather conditions were ideal
and everything favored good results
generally.
The official trial will probably take
place about the middle of September.
DELAWARE BREAKWATER. Del..
July 2.â On the unofficial builders* trip
to-day- the United States armored
cruiser Colorado achieved a maximum
speed over a measured course of 22.31
knots an hour, ' the ' average of two
runs under forced draught being at the
rate of 22.10 knots an hour. This re
sult Is highly gratifying to the build- 1
ers, as the requirements of the con
tract were exceeded ln every respect.
Experts on board predicted after. the
run that the .Colorado would average
not less than 22% knots on the official
trial trip and thus exceed the contract
epeed requirement by at least one-half
knot.

bullet hole through it. At the same

complained of having been hit a blow
on the leg by something. It caused
her such acute - pain that she was

SAN DIEGO, July 2.â More trouble
has cropped out between the Donly
family Â¦ of Escondldo and the Alum

Alumbaugh of Oceanslde and Miss
Edna Donly eloped on the morning of
the latter's graduation from the Escon

rated almost immediately after being
married, and Donly started suit to an
nul the marriage. A telephone message
received to-day conveyed the Informa
tion that this morning an uncle of
young Alumbaugh. who lives near the
Donly family in Escondldo, had been
seen in Donly's field and had entered
there for the purpose of holding con
versation with the bride.' The proceed
ings were witnessed by Mrs. Donly,
who, It is said, came out of the house
and commenced to belabor Alumbaugh
on the head with a club. About this
time, according to the reports received,
young Donly entered the house and
shortly afterward emerged with a shot
gun, which he discharged at Alum
baugh. The latter then drew his re
volver and drove the son, Mrs. Donly
and her daughter into the house.
Mrs. Donly later swore out a war
rant for the arrest of Alumbaugh on a
charge of assault. .

"Take a trip to the 'United States
and view the St. Louis Exposition;
then come back to Japan and witness
the closing incidents of the war, and
you will then have gleaned as much
Information regarding the strife as
the correspondents who are now
locked up in Tokio."
This was the tip given Paul Le
Feuve, a representative of several
French and Belgian papers in the Ori
ent, by a prominent war official of the
Japanese Government. The newspa
per man, who had been several
months in Tokio impatiently awaiting
a chance to go to the front., accepted
it. He arrived here yesterday, and is
registered at the Palace. He repeats
the stories of other correspondents to
the effect that none of them have had
a chance to see any of the fighting. .
A month. ago Le Feuve quietly ap
pealed to one of the Japanese officials
of the -War -Department- for Informa
tion as to when he might, hope to get
to the scene of actual warfare. He
was told he might never have that op
portunity. â¢ The official. apparently ap
preciated the anxiety of the French
man and'suggested thatheshould do
a little sight seeing In America before
the war ended, which, he added, from
a Japanese point of view,- was/ very
certain^ to be within six months. Le
Feuve speaks in the highest terms - of
the military organization of Japan,
admitting that it is excelled by ; ,no
similar body in Europe. The corre
spondent will return'to the Orient- in
about three months unless * the war
ends sooner. **'â¢*

When the smoke cleared away Giblin
began to realize that he had been a
very bad boy. He walked into the near
est saloon and laid his pistol on the
bar. "Come (hie) deliver myself (hlc)
justice," he said tearfully. "Put bunch
of flowers on (hie) grave. Say (hlc)
died game." And Giblin subsided into
peaceful slumber, with his head in a
cuspidor.
He was arrested, but no felony charge
will be placed against him. as the only
fatality that resulted was the death of
the poodle.
Out on Polk street, near Post, there
is a stain on the sidewalk, over which
is written > the simple inscription,
"Fido." But Giblin cannot be held di
rectly responsible for the innocent ani
mal's tragic end.
Giblin is the man who swore to the
complaint against the negro stable
men, Smith and Williams, charging
them with the murder of Anthony
Gallagher, who was shot and killed a
few days ago at Polk and Post streets.
Giblin swore at the Coroner's inquest
that he never carried a revolver.
The petulant pop of the pistol sound
ed musical To his ears. Memories of the
days before the "West became like the
"effete East" came back to him.
"Whoop!" shouted Giblin. "Wake,
snakes, and crawl. I'm Deadwood Pete,
the terror of the plains. I'm the orig
inal bad man from Bodle." .
Instead of jumping at this bargain
the peddler hastened on his way. Stung
by this lack of appreciation, Giblin
drew his revolver and fired a shot sky
ward.
Giblin was standing before the Ex
celsior stables, at 1000 Geary street
Suddenly a peanut â¢ vendor drove by.
He wore a red and green necktie, which
offended Giblin's esthetic tastes.
"I'd knock your head off for 10 cents,"
volunteered Giblin. . , -
It was .not,,a"bullq(. that sent this
gentle but unprepossessing animal to
an early grave. A fat man named John
Blibbetts* heard one of Giblin's leaden
pellets whiz past his ear and fled for
cover. He stepped upon the poodle,
which blended with the sidewalk
beneath 'his -heavy foot. One bullet en
tered a Polk street restaurant and flat
tened against a tenderloin steak. The
others faded into the landscape.
The innocent but obsolete pastime of
shooting up the "town'' was revived by
Edward C. Giblin, a sjriklng stableman,
yesterday. . Though flew north,
east, south 'and '-west* -from Post and
Polk streets,,! there Was. nobody hurt
but a fat poodle. dog. -^> '" Â¦â¢ v, '
PALO ALTO, July 2.â The arrange
ments for the fitting celebration of the
nation's birthday have been completed
and the Indications are that there will
be an unusualfy large attendance of
visitors.- The committee in charge of i
the celebration has worked hard and
earnestly and that success will crown
its efforts Is now an assured fact. '
The parade will be a most striking fea
ture of the festivities and many Native
Sons and Native Daughters from ad-
Joining towns will be in line. There
will be a large delegation* of visitors
from. San Jose, and it is considered,
likely that 'the crowd in Palo Alto on
Monday will far exceed that on pre
vious holidays. The committeemen will
carefully look after the visitors and
nothing will be left undone that might I
contribute to their pleasure. Owing to
the fact that the railroad has given
special holiday rates, many residents
of San Francisco will take advantage
of them and join in Palo Alto's cele
bration.
At a meeting of the Board of Trus
tees of the town of Palo Alto, held to
day, the following resolutions were
adopted:
"Firstâ Resolve**. That, whereas a
certain article entitled 'Palo Alto May
Have Trouble,' has been published In;
an evening paper of the city of San
Francisco at the instigation of the Citi
zens' Alliance and one Herbert George,
president of the San Francisco CitI- \
zens' Alliance, reflecting on the good j
name of the college town of Palo Alto,
and the residents of said town, and
further reflecting on the city govern- j
ment of said town, it is hereby resolved
that said article Is false, unjustified
and injurious to . the interests of the
town of Palo Alto, and without any
foundation whatever.
"Secondâ Resolved, That, whereas,
said article . contained the statement
'that law and order will be maintained
by the Palo Alto Citizens' Alliance at
any cost'; that any such action would
be unlawful and tend to Injure and de
stroy the harmony of the celebration on
the Fourth of July.
"Thirdâ Resolved, That law and or
der will be maintained by the authority !
of the city government of the town
where said authority is vested by the
laws of the State of California, and any
disobedience or Interference with said ;
authority will be summarily dealt with
according to law.
"Fourth â Resolved, That, whereas, '
the Board of Trustees of said town
have already amply provided for police
protection on the ; Fourth of July, any
attempt on the part of local organiza
tions to control in the interests of said
organizations would be unjustifiable
and injurious to the celebration of the
Fourth of July.
"Fifthâ Resolved, That the Board of
Trustees of the town of Palo Alto here
by pledge themselves in the interests
of harmony, peace and good will, and
In the interests of the visitors and resi
dents of the town, to promote and es
tablish so far as In their power friend
ship and good will between each and
all, that the Fourth of July,. 1904, may
go down Into the history of Palo Alto
as a day of joy, and not* of regret, and
to this end the Board of Trustees, in
behalf of the town, ask the co-opera
tion and assistance of all.
"Sixthâ Resolved, That we deplore
the publication of the article that has
caused these resolutions to become
necessary at this time.
"Passed by the Board of Trustees of
the town of Palo Alto.

inaries shall have been arranged with
the construction of the Milk River
canal project and is, now
preparing to move its tracks, from
land that will be submerged by the
Government reservoirs. The Milk Riv
er project is the largest undertaken
by the Government/ It is estimated
that it will result in the reclamation
of 150,000 acres of arid land.
The project provides for the con
struction of a canal 100 miles in
length tapping St. Marys Lake and
the Milk River in the northern part of
Montana and the filling of reservoirs
from which circulating waters will be
drawn. It Is figured by engineers that
it will require two years of steady
flow to fill the reservoir planned by
the Government. The flow of water
will submerge about twenty miles of
the present right of way of the Great
Northern to a depth of about twenty
two feet. Congress at its recent ses
sion appropriated $5,500,000 to carry
on the work.

The house had been under police
guard several weeks. Finally the-cap
tain moved his guard from view and
the proprietors were reassured. Taking
three trusted men, the captain rang the
basement doorbell and was answered
by a negro door man. He was seized
and throttled, while a gag was slipped
into his mouth and handcuffs slapped
over his wrists. Then, with keys taken
from the prisoner's pockets, the police
carefully opened three steel doors and
made their way to the upper floors. .
So quietly had the work been done
that the raiders stood in the darkened

stepped into the brilliantly lighted

cessful here in some time.

MANILA. July 2.^ â After extensive
discussion in public the internal-reve
nue* law for the Philippine 1 Islands,
which was prepared by Governor
Wright, has been passed by the Civil
Commission. It is estimated that this
law_will produce a yearly revenue of
$5,000,000 in gold, one-quarter- of
which will revert to the provinces and
municipalities where it is collected and
three-quarters of which will go to the
insular government.
C Under *thetlaw7fÂ«3ces will beÂ£Jevied
principally upon alcoholic productions,
beer, tobacco, cigars, cigarettes and
matches. There is to be an" "occupa
tion tax" and revenue will be derived
from licenses. The law repeals a great
number of / taxes now imposed upon
poor people by- the existing Spanish
law. The "tax upon liquors and
tobacco provided for under the law
is much lower than such taxes in the
United States.
It is believed the new law will fur
nish a basis to provide a substantial
and sufficient revenue for the Govern
ment should free trade between the
United States and the Philippines ulti
mately be established.

As a result of the State law, supple
mented by the court - order, nearly
2500 convicts in the penitentiaries at
Joliet and Chester and the reforma
tory at Pontiac are idle. The injunc
tion was procured by Attorney Levy
Mayer in behalf of several clients, one
of whom is a non-resident of Illinois.
This was done to give the Federal
court jurisdiction, and it is said that
persons who have held prison con
tracts are behind the action. The
trade unions Influenced the passage
of the law which has stopped contract
labor in the penal institutions of Illi
nois.
Dr. James G. Kiernan, who is famil
iar with the conduct of prisons and
asylums In America and Europe, to
day said:
. "The inevitable result the world
over of idleness in prison has been an
increase of outbreaks against disci
pline, an increase of insane cases and
increase in victims of tuberculosis."

State law preventing .prison contract
labor became effective yesterday, but
on top of that has been placed an in
junction issued by Judge Humphrey
of ihe Federal court at Springfield
which restrains the expenditure of
State funds to make operative the sys

Special Dispatch to The Call.
The striking feature of the official
statement of the New York Associated
Banks last week was its failure fully
to reflect the gain in cash, which was
estimated on the basis of the traceable
movements of money during the week,
the estimates Indicating an increase of
?7,57F,S08, while the gain as shown by
the bank returns was only $71,309. <3on-
Eidering the fact, however, that the
total cash made *> new high record, the
smaller, gain in this Item, compared
with the estimate, is not important.
The discrepancy of $7,514,600 ; between
the actual and the estimated gain
seemed to have been due to specially
large payments liy one of the banks.
Loans were, as was expected, increased.
and the expansion of $5,128,300 In this
item carries the total to within $3,837,
100 of the highest on record.
The increase last week was most like
ly due to loans of funds early in the
"Â«Â«*k which had been deposited -pre
paratory to' the disbursement of July
Interest and dividends, and also to syn
diAte borrowings. The deposits were
increased by 59.674,700, or $743,400 great
er than the sum of the" expansion. In
Joans and the gain in cash, therefore
the statement was technically out of
proof. The required reserve was in
creased $2,418,673, deducting from which
the gain in cash left $2,347,375 as the
decrease in surplus reserve to $36,105,-
S00. Computed upon the basis of de
posits less those of $23,246,600 public
funds, the surplus was $41,916,550. Cir
culation was increased $238,500, making
a gain in this item of $3,205,900 efcice
May 14.
It may be noted that the public de
posits have been reduced $32,976,100
since the end of April, chiefly the result
of the surrenders of those funds which
*vere specially held on the Panama
canal account and of subsequent with
drawals in response to treasury calls.
The daily average of bank clearings
for the week was $205,000,000, against
$176,000,000 In the previous week. This
increase partly reflects operations In
connection with payments of half year
ly interest and dividend payments. The
clearings on Saturday, representing
Friday's business, were $298,015,S5~, or
considerably above the daily average.
Comparisons of loans show that seven
banks gained $6,300,000 net, eight hanks
decreased cash by $400,000 net and the
reduction In the case of at least one
bank was quite important.

NEW YORK. July 2.â Henry Gard
ner, stockholder In the Marconi Wire
less Telegraph Company of America,
has begun a suit in the Supreme Court
against that corporation and its dJ
' rectors, in which he demands an ac
1 counting as to the affairs of the com
pany; an injunction restraining the
directors from making and disposing
of its assets, or from interfering in
any way with its management; the
appointment of a receiver - for the
company, and for such other relief as,
the court may deem he is entitled to.
The company was incorporated un
der the laws of New Jersey with a
capital of $6,650,000, and it is alleged
by the company that of this amount
$61,190,000 of stock has been issued
and is outstanding.

fendants caused to be Issued on March
21 last a statement or balance sheet,
which set forth that on June 1. 1904,
the company was the owner of cer
tain rights, privileges and contracts
of the alleged value of $5,318,494,
which, together with othÂ«r Items,
made an equalization between the as
sets and liabilities. He alleges that
the patent rights and patents and con
tracts referred to in the flnanacial
statement were not worth on January

$5,318,494, and that the capital stock
or cash given in payment of those
rights, patents and contracts was man
ipulated by E. Rollins Morse, one of
the defendants, who "Gardner says he
believes had been the chief promoter

Gardner asserts that the directors
of the corporation have mismanaged
its affairs and wasted its assets. He
asks that they be removed from of

portunities that are ours and to avail
ourselves of the vast possibilities that
await us."
"In bringing the opportunities of the
Pacific Coast prominently before the
w<jrld and creating a Western immi
gration it must certeinly be obvious
that better results can be reached if all
the Pacific Coast States will work in

ing. There is no doubt that Portland,

and all the cities on this coast will be

general welfare of Â£he entire coast is
< <T?idered in our promotion efforts.
Â¦ There is a particular satisfaction in
tarrying on this development work, be
cause the resources, the climate and
ether natural advantages of this won

claimed. There is not in the world a
section to compare with the lands that
slope to the Pacific Ocean, and when
the interior is filled with an industri
ous population our cities will rank

that time comes, California, Oregon,

ach, bowels and kidneys failed to work. I had
catarrh of stomach head and bladder as a re-
sult of the dlseaae: these troubles became
chronic. At times my heart would beat like a
drum, my eyes grew weak, my memory bad.
my nerves wrecked. Three months ago I went
to Tuscan Springs. What happened since wh
a pleasant surprise to me. Drank the waters,
took the baths â after thrte weeks' treatment
etoroach. bowels, bladder and kidneys In per-
fect condition, eyesight perfect, nervousness
gone, memory good. After three months' treat- |
ment. walked without a cane, with eyes closed I
and up and down steep hills; am cured of this I
dread disease, now walk with slight limp.
Hav* run stores In seventeen towns of the
State of CaliXornla; am well known In down-

will prove truth of my helpless condition three
months ago. Further information, addraas

has been so often described as an ac
complished fact that one Is apt to be
chary of accepting any statement with
regard to an Invention of the kind. A
printing process In colors which has
novel points has been Invented by Herr
Szezapanlk, and was recently brought
undÂ«r the notice of the London Camera
Club. The process utilizes a special
kind of prepared paper which is coated
first of all with collodion 01 gelatine
stained blue, next with one stained yel
low, and finally with a surface stained
red. These colors are of such a fugi
tive nature that when the paper is ex
posed to light they are destroyed. But
if during exposure the mper Is covered
with a colored original, say a stained
glass window, the colors In the original
preserve the colors burled in the paper,
and they are not obliterated. In other
words, a colored transparent picture is

beneath It under the action of light.
Specimens which, were examined by
members of the Camera Club proved
the process to be a practical one. The
colors remaining: on the paper after ex
posure to light can be fixed by a mor
dant so as to become permanent. Un

UNLESS something unforeseen interferes to mar the
game, the siege of Port Arthur promises to pro
vide a solution of one of the most interesting
military problems of the time. It has long been a sub
ject of speculation whether the improvements of weap
ons in the last twenty years has added most to the'
strength of the offensive or the defensive in war. Port
Arthur is reported to have been fortified regardless of
expense and according to the best methods 'of military
engineering. It is supposed to be thoroughly equipped
in every way, and thus represents the best that can be
done in the way of defensive, work. On the other hand
the attacking farce is possessed of every known weapon
of assault, and understands well how. to handle each and
all of them: It is now to be seen which of the two has
the advantage in the conflict.
The London Times in reviewing the formidable char
acter of the Russian fortifications recently said: "If the
Japanese decide to attack Port Arthur we shall witness
cither the apotheosis or the unrcgretted demise of the
first-class fortress. If we consider that the defense of
Port Arthur has been the labor of years; that strong,
semi-closed works, with gorges protected by masonry
walls loopholed for musketry, and ditches -flanked by
escarp and counterscarp galleries, have been constructed
on all the surrounding heights, and further, that some
400 siege guns, besides naval ordnance, are in position,
mounted on disappearing or overbank carriages, we are
entitled to conclude that if 38,000 Russians of the land
and sea forces cannot holdtout for many months in this
fastness, all the cost, and labor and art will have been
misapplied." - '- :
Relying upon the strength of the fortifications, many
n2Iitary experts believe; that, if the- Russians bravely de
fend it Port Arthur' can- be taken only after a siege long
enough to reduce the garrison to starvation. On the
other hand, many believe the fortifications can be car
ried by assault. One of them writing for the St. Janies
Gazette says:
"Despite the increased strength of the modern for
tress the attack has gained in power, to an even greater
extent. The enormously increased range and weight of
modern artillery will enable the Japanese ; to place a
hrge number of^eavy^batterics out; of sight on a long"
outer circle, behind a chain of fortified posts, and while
subjecting the defenses generally to an , accurate high
angle fire they will be able to concentrate a steady rain
of high-explosive shells upon the points selected for at
tack.; These, which can. be lobtiecf into defenses from a,

Croker as an Irish Squire.
Special Correspondence.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL.
5 HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN, LONDON, June IS.âRich
ard Croker, 1 am told. Is seldom seen
at Wantage in these days. He nevdr
has found the somewhat frigid social
atmosphere of England much to his
liking and Is consequently devoting
most of his time to his Irish residence,
Parkiston Lodge on the Curragh of
Kildare, where his money ena*bles him
to play the role of squire with much
more success. The lodge is not a pre
tentious place, but is large enough to
provide accommodation for some two
6core gruests, and among those at pres
ent enjoying Mr. Croker's hospitality
ere several American friends.
Never have the simple Kildare folk
seen entertainments on so lavish a
6cale before. Motor cars are there In
abundance, brakes, broughams and
dogcarts crowd the country roads and
spirited hunters are provided from the
stables for guests who delight In a
dash across country. All this adds to
the prosperity of the neighborhood and
as the scanty earnings of the peasan
try are increased by many odd jobs
and generous tips they bless the day
Â¦when the ex-boss of Tammany came
among them and devoutly hope that
he may long dwell in tneir midst.
Croker was too long accustomed to
popularity in America to be indifferent
to it, from whatever source It comes,
and it is more than likely that their
wish will be gratified.
The situation of Parkiston Lodge
suits him admirably. It is sufficiently
rear to Dublin to admit of friends run
ning out for dinner and returning the
same night if they wish. The pictur
esque country round about appeals
strongly to men of sporting tastes, af
fording plenty of good shooting and
abundance of room /or cross-country
riding.
Shooting Crocodiles.
Ajer buaia bcrnang (teach a crocodile
to swim) is a favorite Malay retort;
but only those who have seen the wily
saurian whirl off a mud bank into deep
water, splashing his tail and leaving a
wake like a twenty-knot steamer, can
appreciate the sarcasm to its full ex
tent. Yet, strangely enough, very few
men will go out of their way to shoot
a crocodile, says H. H. Hipwell in the
London Field: and as the Malays them
selves seldom trouble to get rid of the
brutes, they flourish exceedingly all
along the west coast of the peninsula,
from Kedah In the north to Johore and
Singapore in the south. I
Steaming to the southward through
Malacca Straits in any small local
craft, one hugs the land sufficiently
close to discern the characteristics of
the Immediate shore. Mangrove
Ewamps and mud flats, sluggish rivers
rolling their yellow waters seaward
through many channeled deltas, make
a crocodilian paradise; and the long,
Ecaly reptiles have not failed to take
advantage of it. Seldom a week passes
without a report coming to hand of the
disappearance of some unfortunate or
other, who, paddling his tiny dugout up
stream, has been knocked from his
perch in the stern by a stroke of the
reptile's tail, and then has been car
ried resistlessly away to some under
â¢water larder, there to be kept till a
convenient season; for the crocodile
prefers his food high, and, contrary to
popular belief, rarely bolts a kill on
the spot.
Sometimes it happens that one or
more crocodiles will take up their quar
ters close to a Malay kampongâ i, e.,
village; and then it behooves all the
mothers to keep a sharp eye on their
children, for the cunning beast has
been known to swim noiselessly for
some distance past the spot where the
children are playing by the water's
edge, then, going ashore, it executes
a flank movement, and coming down
cpon the unsuspecting little ones from
the long grass behind it seizes its vic
tim and plunges into the water ere the
other children fully realize what has
happened.
Several ways of catching the brute
when he becomes more than usually
dangerous to life and limb are em
ployed by the Malays 1 but, for reasons
â¢which will appear later, the destruction
of a crocodile Is only decided upon
when all attempts to drive him from
the neighborhood of the kampong have
failed. For elmple ingenuity it would
be hard to beat the plan usually pur
eued on the Kedah River, which de
bouches Into the Malacca Strait, about
fifteen miles northeast of Pulo PInang.
The modus operand! is as follows: A
email bamboo raft some two feet square
Is constructed, and on It Is erected
a flagpcst surmounted by a red flag,
while from the under Bide of the raft
or float runs twenty or thirty yards
of stout line, ending in a few feet of
chain. To this chain the barbed hook
of hard brass metal is attached by
three feet of untwisted fiber, In order
that the fine ligaments may get be
tween the crocodile's teeth and thus
prevent his snapping off the bait On
the shank of the hook a live fowl is
made fast, together with a short length
of bamboo to give it flotation, and then
raft, line and bait are dropped into the
river. Loudly squawks the unfortun
ate fowl for a few minutes, but its
Borrows are short-lived. A splash, a
twirl, the bait has. disappeared, and the
men return to their* homes, leaving a
boy to> mark the progress of the float-
The announcement is made that certain bankers who
aesire to support the Democratic' ticket will demand that
the platform indorse the gold standard. But what will
be the merit in such indorsement for such a purpose?
The gold standard was denounced in 1890 to catch votes.
If indorsed now to catch votes, what is to be thought of
the party that hunts votes in that way?
McKinley was called back from political exile and sat
at the head of the chiefs. Abiding by a permanent issue
had its reward. The people indorsed the v permanent
substance of things, and the party that stands by its
guns. In the politics of a free people principle and not
expediency is demanded by v the public safety. If free
silver were an essential to the national life in 1896/ it is
so now. If the gold standard were fatal to our progress
and prosperity then, it is so now. â¢ If the Democracy
were sincere in those two campaigns, it is a coward now
to desert the principles it professed.
Its platform of this year will make a profuse spread of
professions. Will it mean what it says? Will it make
the same proclamation twenty years from now? Will it
stand hitched? â¢
IT is evident that the Democracy will shed its skin at
St. Louis. That is to say, it will cast off "the paramount
issues upon which it has stood for the last eight
years. Tillman, Carmack, Teller, Dubois and practic
ally all of the Senators ofcthat party. now speak of the
issues of the last two campaigns as "ancient history,"
and are in "favor of their repudiation. Yet they are the
issues upon which Teller and Dubois walked out of
the Republican convention of 1896 -and into the Demo
cratic party. Then, rree silver, destruction of the courts,
government by injunction, and denial of the right of
contract, were declared to be permanent, paramount and
vital to the very existence of the country. But now in
stead of free silver we have the gold standard; the
courts are supreme; the right of contract is judicially
protected, and property is defended by the writ of in
junction, which has been the mainstay of equity since
the days of Ellesmere, and the country instead of going
into a decline is better, stronger, more prosperous and
freer than ever.
j So events have proved the folly of the men who made
the issues of 1S96 and 1900, and called them paramount.
If those issues were right it is the first and highest duty
of the Democracy to reassert them and fight for them
as the Crusaders fought for the rescue of the Holy Sep
ulcher. Only in that way can a party command the con
fidence of the people in its sincerity. In 1890 the Re
publican party affirmed its faith in protection and con
creted it in the McKinley bill. Immediately it was swept
out of the House, McKinley himself Â«was beaten, and the
Democracy triumphed so overwhelmingly that when the
new Congress organized in December, 1891, the smallest
cloakroom was large enough for the Republican caucus.
This expulsion of the party from the House was fol
lowed in 1892 by the second election of Mr. Cleveland,
who carried Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Connecticut,
and could have carried Ohio if his managers had known
the situation there. It looked like the effacement of
the Republican party. It lost both houses of Congress
and the Presidency, and went down in a universal dis
aster far greater than that which overtook the Democ
racy in, the last two campaigns. But did the leaders lose
heart? Did they proceed to repudiate the issue upon
which they were defeated? No, every one held his
ground. In every convention in every State the party
reaffirmed protection as a permanent principle and stood
by the flag that had been carried by Fremont and Lin
coln, by Grant and Garfield, and in 1896 this fidelity was
rewarded by an overwhelming return of popular con
fidence.

half a dozen men paddle down stream
until they sight the raft. Then, taking
the line ashore, they haul away, and
as by this time the hook is firmly
entangled in the crocodile's intestines,
hie shows but little fight, and is easily j
dispatched. - 1
Both In Kedah and in Province Wei- !
lesly it is possible to get a shot frpm
shore, and even in Penang Harbor an \
occasional crocodile has been seen on i
the muddy beach in front of the club.
These stray specimens 'must have
crossed from the mainland at least a
mile away, a fact which conclusively |
disproves the theory regarding the
crocodile's helplessness in sea water.
Moreover, .there is one huge brute |
which has been seen several times, both :
ashore and afloat, close to the fishing . :
village at Tanjong To-kang, a small i
promontory not three miles from Pen
ang town. He Is regarded as kramat â J
1. e.. holy, or the abode of a spirit â j
by the Malay and Chinese fishers j
thereabouts, who aver that he has !
never yet been known to touch a
human being; and they certainly
testify to the reality of their belief j
by boldly working their prawn nets on
the muddy shallows a hundred yards j
or more from shore. j
On one occasion I was lucky enough .
to get a glimpse of him as he scuttled ;
seaward, and the brief scrutiny thus ;
afforded did not evoKe a desire for
closer acquaintance. His scales were ;
of a dull brown hue, differing entirely
from the usual color, wnlch Is a dark j
olive green; the body seemed unusually
broad, and the tall stumpy and thick. ,
Needless to say, there was no gun j
handy, or I wouldn't have had the luck
to see him. ;
Crocodile shooting Is usually pooh- â¢
pohed on the ground that it affords
but indifferent sport, and to a certain .
extent this is true. But, nevertheless, i
It has a charm of its own and if proper j
care be exercised the sportsman will
usually be able tp get a fair chance
for a shot during his day's outing, and
if the bullet does strike home he has j
the satisfaction of knowing thaf one of ;
the cruel brutes has gone to his ac- |
count, and probably serves as a funeral
feast to his fellow reptiles at the same !
time. Though it is possible to get a shot Â¦
from shore the best plan Is to take a j
canoe, or koleh, as the Malays term ;
them, together with a couple of men (
to paddle. As to guns, of course, every I
man has his choice, but It is difficult j
to beat a .44 Winchester for all round
work. Time your departure so as to
arrive at the river mouth shortly be- j
fore dead low water, and then, as you ;
near the spot, load your rifle, get as
far for'ard as you can and wait. The
Malays are up to their work, and pad- j
die the koleh swiftly through the water .
with short, noiseless strokes, while you â¢
search the low mudbanks ahead as
carefully as you can.
"Tuan, tuan, to the right, to the"
right," comes a whisper from .behind: ;
you. The head of the koleh swings .
round a little, and there, on a bank j
of sandy mud, lies an indistinguishable
something. It may be a crocodile or :
it may be a piece of driftwood; at any j
rate you are creeping nearer and j
nearer every minute and you cover it j
with the rifle. Suddenly the erstwhile !
log seeme to break about two feet from
the end nearest you, and a patch of !
dull, whitey yellow becomes visible. It j
is the under side of the throat, and .
instinctively you pick it up with your \
foresight and fire. Directly you have J
flr.ed. paddle as*quickly as possible, for,
hit or miss, he will have made off Into
the river. Examine the bank carefully, i
and if you are lucky there will be a i
few dark blood stains on the sand, and :
in nine cases out of ten that is all that ;
you will ever see of your kill. j
On one occasion a well-known sports- j
man in the straits killed instantane- j
ously a big brute some twenty feet â¢
long, using a service rifle and Mark IV j
ammunition. The dum-dum penetrated
the horny cartilage just below the eye,
and mushrooming at once, drilled the
crocodile from end to end. This, how
ever, was at an unusually close range,
eay ten to- fifteen yards, and the Im
pact must have been terrific. In the j
peninsula, as elsewhere, the precise j
significance of the terms crocodile and j
alligator, as applied to the indigenous '
saurians of the country, is a matter of
frequent and sometimes bitter dispute.
Not being a skilled naturalist, I can
only add as my quota to the discussion
the remark, based on personal observa
tion, that both the long-pointed snout
of the true crocodile (C. palustrls) and
the broad, squat head of the gavlal
seem to be equally common In the

THE departure of Attorney General Knox from the
Cabinet was closely followed by an inspired dis
patch to the effect that Judge Moore would be
transferred from the bench at Nome and exchanged for
a judicial officer who formerly presided over the court
at Nome. \ That part of Alaska, 6000 miles from Wash
ington, is practically governed by the Federal Judge
who holds court at Nome. He may be the instrument
of justice and. good government, or he may be a partial
and unjust judge and the worker of woe to the de
fenseless. Like all mining- camps, Nome is a hotbed of
litigation. No prospector nor poor man with a mine is
safe from an attack upon his title, on which the court
has to pass. The cost and difficulties of an appeal are
so great that when the judgment is unjust,, or even infa
mous, it is apt to stand, for the victim cannot reach ah
appellate bench. â' â¢
The locality is so distant and isolated that it must.be
strong moral fiber in a man that does not untwist and
slacken, and several sad. experiences have proved that
the, "judge on that bench must be of high and well-sea
soned good character to withstand the tendencies of,
the situation.* Judge Moore has proved to be such a
judge. He has dispensed justice, and has not dispensed
with it, and has governed uprightly.. Every suitor in his
court has had the benefit of the law, and his career has
actually advanced civilization .on that remote and rough
frontier.
He was the personal selection of Attorney General
Knox for the place, and the good judgment of the selec
tion is shownâ m. the entire subsidence of the judicial
scandals which made Nome a sort of plague spot. The
statement that he is to- be transferred has a sinister ap
pearance that will appal, the decent people of that 'part
of Alaska." If Mr. Knox can protect as Senator, the good
appointment he made as Attorney General, he will do
Alaska a great service and the people of Nome a favor
that will be highly appreciated. â¢;'.'. - .

vegetables, flowers or shining milk cans
is a familiar one. They trot along
underneath the cart, within easy reach
of the blunt toe of the sabot of the
woman, who walks behind It to guide
it by the handles attached at that
point. In Belgium the dogs are hitched
in front, as the Russians attach their
horses to their drosktes, three abreast,
and are % guided by a pair of rope reins
fastened to a muzzle about the nose of
t^e dog in the middle. Recently the
National Cart Dog Association; organ
ized to regenerate the original race of
Belgian mastiffs, held its' first exhibi
tion of cart dogs. The Flemish breed
ers have found that in crossing the Bel
gian mastiffs with the Great Danes,
with the idea of Increasing the size of
the cart dogs, anfi so securing addi
tional strength, they made a mistake.
The result proved to be animals with
weak ' hindquarters and disproportion
ate limbs. Now they are endeavoring
to revive the original stock.
The women and dogs of these two lit
tle countries are another evidence that
human and canine nature are the same
the world over. When one sees the
white-capped Belgian milk woman with
her dogs standing near a well, the
woman having a battered can slung on

Summing up the results of the fair

per says that, considering the unusual

cellent. They are ready to pay back
the Government's loan of plus $4,500,

to the city having been swamped by Its

anywhere appeared. The hotels haven't

Both together It was estimated that
they will accommodate 600,000 vis
itors, and a larger number than this at
any one time Is not expected. Trans
portation has not been overtaxed, no
anything like it. As to extortion, such
a thing has not been heard of, at any
rate, since Secretary Hay left for the
East some time ago. On the contrary,
visitors have been agreeably surprised
at the moderation of the charges. Tho
paper estimates that a two weeks' out-

the country and back Included, should
come within $100', which It thinks Is
cheap enough, when It la conslaered
what is given for It, and there Is little

prevailing anywhere that it Is well

Computations made upon the proportion of people
who own their residences may bring alarm to students
of social affairs. It appears from the records of the last
census that the American people are becoming less and
less proprietors, that fewer own the houses which cover
them than ever before. The extreme of this condition
is evidenced most naturally in the industrial communities
and large cities; in the rural districts the percentage of
householders is largest. When it is considered, how
ever, that with the growth ! of the country and the grad
ual absorption of the population into industrial centers
a ; decline in the proprietary class must inevitably follow,
these census figures need not'secm alarming. Proprie
torship is the necessary adjunct of the producer of raw
material but not inevitably of the industrial worker.
A feature of the census statistics that should cause all
marriageable ladies to sit up and take notice is that
which proclaims our Pacific Coast States as taking the
lead in matrimony. Of the marriageable portion of
femininity in the Coast States 60 per cent are married
as against 59 per cent in the Central West and 54 along
the Atlantic seaboard. Here is a golden fact for our
Promotion Committee to incorporate in their boom
sheets for California. Let a pamphlet containing the
glad tidings be mailed to every women's club east of the
Sierras.
THE abstract, of Â» the tenth census of the United
States, recently published by the Department of
Commerce, contains food for reflection by econo
mists and students of social problems alike. For by
these figures taken from the complete roll of the census
of 1900 the comparison made with those of the former
general counts offers data upon the trend of social.con
ditions in our nation. Upon the whole we find as the
result of this comparison reason for a very optimistic
hope for the future. â¢
Of particular importance, in view of the recent agita
tion set to stem what were feared to be tendencies to
ward race suicide in our people, is the computation made
upon the increase in native born population during the
ten years past. In the period between the last two cen
sus takings the increase in native born over the number
shown in 1890 has been 22 per cent, while the corre
sponding growth in the number of those of foreign
birth has risen only 12 per cent above that of the former
census. When we compare these figures with those re
cently published in the "Economiste Francaise" we find
that race suicide is yet far from being our portion. Ac
cording to that journal the excess of births over deaths
in France for the year 1901 was only 72,398, and in 1902
83,044.

Inclined to practical jolting and the
stories they frequently tell upon each
other show that some of their Jokes
do not always work according to ex
pectations. Here Is the latest:
Fisk, McGettigan and three or four
others were at the club a few days
ago enjoying a swim. All but Flsk left
the tank and went to their room to
dress. While they were laughing and
talking one of the crowd picked up
a bunch of keys.
, "Whose property?" he asked- All re
plied, "Not mine," and Dr. McGettlgan
vouchsafed the Information that they
belonged to Flsk and suggested that
they be thrown In a corner, where the
Postmaster could not find them. "His
family is out of town." said the doctor;
"when he gets home to-night he will
have to do a little chasing for a lock
smith to get inâ Just as I had to do
several nights ago."
The suggestion was a good one, every
one declared, and Into a dark corner
the keys were thrown and covered with
a towel.
Late that night Dr. McGettlgan was
seen at the phone in a corner grocery
near his home. He was calling up the
Olympic Club and when he got an
answer, he said:
"Hello, Olympic This is Dr. McGet
tigan. Will you send a boy up to room

under a towel in the left corner. They
are mine and I need them to get in

The close balance between the two forces renders the
issue one of great interest to the civilized world. Should
the defensive powers of- modern armaments prove to be
easily superior to those of offense, we may be in a meas
urable distance of the establishment of a permanent
peace, because aggressive wars will be too dangerous to
be lightly undertaken! On* the other hand should the
offensive force find it easy to pound the defense into
surrender, it is hardly likely the future history of the
nations will be in any great degree different from that
of the tpast.

PERFECTS A BIG LOAN
A notable event in the library world
occurred in the recent dedication of
the John Carter Brown Library build
ing at Brown University, Providence,
,11. I. For this building $150,000 was
given by John Nicholas Brown, son of
John Carter Brown. The donation
was but one of a trinity of gifts made
by this generous donor. For the en
dowment of the library he gave
$500,000 and also a collection of books
vulued at over $1,000,000. In reality
this accumulation is of almost price
less value because of the : rarity
of many of the volumes. In
Americana it is reputed to be the best
in the world, while its collection of
early colonial, Spanl3h-Amerlcan and
Mexican records Is surpassed by few.
A touching incident of the dedication
was the presentation of the keys of the
building by the 4-year-o!d son of the
donor, who died before his benefac
tions had taken shape. y

It is seldom that a city is perplexed
by an opportunity of possessing two
main library buildings. Such an em
barrassment comes to the v city of
Nashua, N, H., which now owns the
Hunt Memorial Library building, upon
news that by the will of Mrs. Daniel
Husse^ of Kentucky, made' in 1871,
the city is bequeathed $50,000 for a
public library building. The will stipu
lates that the building cost $40,000
and that $10,000 be invested for a
book fund. A solution of this diffi
culty may be found in placing the
second or new library building In the
northern part "of Nashua.
The opening of Reno's $15,000 Car
negie building on June 4 crowned the
prolonged labors of a few earnest men
and women in securing legislation and
in awakening general interest in free
libraries In Nevada.
The Fresno library wants â as what
library does not?- â more books. An
swering an appeal, a citizen offers to
give 5 cents a day for twelve months
by purchasing each month a $1 50
book of his own selaction. which is
subject to the approval of the librarian
and trustees. He proposes that 499
others try the same experiment.
Not satisfied by giving, with his
partner, a $2000 library building to the
Laton Library Association of Laton,
Fresno County, Captain Saunders has
challenged his fellow citizens by an
other proposition. , He now offers the
association $100 if it will raise an
other hundred by October 1.
LIBRARIES IN NEVADA^
One of the leaders in library work
thus voices the belief of the far-seeing
men of this age, saying: "No thought
ful man can question that it is a su
preme concern to provide for our peo
ple the best of the literature of power
which inppires and builds character
ami of the literature of knowledge
which informs and builds prosperity.
This can be done effectively and eco
nomically only through free public* li
braries. A limited number can buy, or
hire* their books, but experience has
proven that unless knowledge is as
free cs air or water. It is fearfully
handicapped, and ths state cannot af
ford to allow even the smallest ob
stacle to remain between any of its
citizens and the desire" for either in
spiration or information."
The Union Club of Santa Barbara
has donated a fine painting of Car
penteria Creek to the Public Library.
Sometimes the question is thought
lessly asked, "What Is the use of a
public library?" One answer may be
given in the description of a single
group that recently* stood before the
delivery desk of a free library. There
were present four nurses from the
State Hospital for wprks on physiol
ogy; three machinists, wanting late
mechanical jvorks; two Swedes, asking
for books fn their native tongue; a
young lady, for a description of Eng
land's crown jewels; a craftsman, seek
ing Information .as to women's guilds
in America, and a clergyman, calling
for the best magazine articles on the
negro question.
.But there is a pitiful aspect in con
nection with the lack. of knowledge in
the public mind concerning the func
tions of the public library. There are
thousands of people In our large cities
who do not know even of the existence
of a free library in their midst. A late
incident in one of our bay cities em
phasizes this statement. It. seems that
a longshoreman, who Is a , constant
reader of library books 'at the noon
lunch hour, had often been asked by
his mates what his books cost him.
They refused to believe that there was
any institution in their city which
gave such privileges without charge.
Reporting his experience with them to
the library management. It is Interest
ing to know that they at once took up
the matter for investigation.
Many of the larger libraries of the
country which have longest been
grappling with the problem of how to
reach the masses with good reading
find it advisable to do what every mer
chant does â advertise. This is often
found most effective through placards
hung on office, workshop and dock
walls.

One of the objectionable sections
which prevented the signature of the
representative of the Masters' Associa
tion is the stipulation that "No em
ployer must hire a helper who is not a
member of the Journeymen's Union."
This clause is heldi under a recent de
cision of the Supreme Court of Illinois,
to be unconstitutional and the Masters'
Association will probably remain firm
in its refusal to accept the agreement.

were in attendance and the remarks of

ing that Anthony Gallagher, who was
killed a week ago in a clash between
union and non-union men, was mur
dered at the direct instance of the Citi

the San Francisco Labor Council had

efits would be paid regularly. In view
of these conditions the men were urged

WASHINGTON. July 2. â John J.
Hill, who was found unconscious in
Ban Francisco and later died, was for
merly an attorney in this city. He
was unmarried. His father is em
ployed in* the Pension Bureau here.
Young Hill was recently appointed to
a clerkship in the Philippines at a
salary of $900 per year.
Even the police believe that Hill was
struck down for the purpose of rob
bery. When he was found at the cor
ner cf Beale and Mission streets early
Friday morning no valuables were on
hie person. He had money when he se
cured his transportation and after he
had paid hi* hotel bill. The cause of
his death vn* undoubtedly a hard
dealt blow, as Dr. Bacigalupi found,
during the autopsy, that concussion of
the brain had been so intense that it
could not have resulted from a fall.
Xo word had been received from the
Quartermaster's department last night
as to Hill's antecedents, though the
transfer from the Virginia station
woald indicate that he had been in the
service prior to being transferred to
Manila.
Coroner Leland had a jury summoned
yesterday afternoon to view the re
mains before they were taken to the
Logan and the same men will later in
vestigate Hill's death.
After the Jury viewed the remains,
Hill's body was placed in a casket and
taken from the morgue in an army
wagon to the transport Logan, where
it will be cared for until the authori
ties at Washington decide what shall
be done or relatives claim it.
It Is understood that the matter will
be taken up by the Government and
the case turned over to the secret ser
vice department for investigation.

1>EAI*S IX THE COUXTRY.
The sales In the first half of 1904
were distributed as follows: 50-varas,
379 sales, amounting to $5,S20,050;
100-varas, 21 sales, amounting to $3,
703,0S0; Potrero and South San Fran
cisco, 250 sales, amounting to $272,
341; Mission, 996 sales, amounting to
$2,520,386; Western Addition, 994
sales, amounting to $7,687,544; outside
land and homesteads. 1014 sales, rep
resenting $2,004,828. These figures
show the strong drift of capital toward
investments in the resyience portions
of San Francisco. Downtown prices
are stiff and the people who believe in
San Francisco are devoting much at
tention to various sections where im
provement is assured, with consequent
appreciation of values.
During the month of June the sales
of city realty amounted to $4,176,550,
the largest amount of any month in
the first half of the present year. As
showing the immediate direction of
public interest, the distribution of
sales for the month just passed is also
given, the figures being taken from the
Real Estate Circular: 50-varas. 152
sales, $2,065,825; 100-varas, 33 sales,
$516,875; Potrero and South San
Francisco. 39 sales. $41,300; Mission,
163 sales. $402,120; Western Addition,
130 sales. 1870,130; outside lands, 156
sales, $260,300. Altogether there were
673 sales in June, representing a value
of $4,176,550.
Building contracts In the citv of
San Francisco during the first six
months of the present year repre
sented a value In improvements of
$8,525,129. Thomas Magee &. Sons, In
their Real Estate Circular, report 3844
transfers of -city realty in the same
period for $22,008,229. This is the
largest number of sales in any six
months with one exception in the his
tory of the city. Last year the sales
in the first six months numbered 2824
and in the first six months of the pre
ceding year they were 3541. The only
six months equaling the first half of
the present year in number of sales
was in 1869, when the Central Pacific
Road entered the city. The total then
was 4615. In the second half of 1869
the sales were but 2293. The Circular
says:
"It will thus be seen that in the year
1869 the sales In the second half of
the year were more. than 40 per cent
less than in the first half year in
amount and more than 50 pet cent
less in number. The sales likewise in
the second half year of 1875 dropped
50 per cent In amount and more than
2SH per cent in number. This show
ing for the first half of the year 1904
is therefore most gratifying, and the
indications seem to point to no great
cessation in real estate transactions
for the balance of the year 1904."

OFFICERS FOR ENSUING TERM
Manager Arthur R. Brlggs of the
California State Board of Trade has
addressed the Chicb Chamber of Com
merce In reference to sending to St.
Louis a stated quantity of fresh fruit
each week to be displayed by the Cal
ifornia Commissioners. Mr. Briggs
suggested that from three to flve boxes
should be forwarded from Chico every
j seven days for a period of from ten
i to twelve weeks. The fruit coming to
San Francisco in care of the State
,Board of Trade will be forwarded to
St ; Louis at the expense of the board.
It will be exhibited at St. Louis
first and then be used in en
tertaining visitors to the fair and giv
ing them a practical demonstration of
California products. It was agreed
that that County Board of Supervis
ors Bhould be asked to appropriate
5200 to provide for the expense and
the matter will come before the Su
pervisors this week. The Chico Cham
ber of Commerce is about to issue 10,
000 pamphlets illustrative of the re
sources and advantages of Chico.
These will be distributed largely
through the State Board of Trade.
From Chico Manager ' Briggs went
to Redding, where he saw the presi
dent and secretary of the Merchants'
Association and asked them to supply
fresh fruit for display at St. Louis.
He also explained at- Redding the
present work of the State Board of
Trade and tpld what is being done to
broaden the work. A meeting of the
Redding Merchants'' Association will
be held soon to hear Mr. Briggg.
It has been arranged that Manager
Briggs and Secretary Fletcher shall
go to Nevada City this week to ad
dress the Nevada County Board of Su
pervisors. The Sportsmen's Club has
its meeting July 7. The gathering
will be fololwed by a dinner, to which
Messrs Briggs and Fletcher are in
vited.
The State Board of Trade yesterday
received Gaston Albert!, representing
the Ministry of Commerce of France,
and Paul Desachy, editor of Le Sle
cle, who are touring California and
Gathering information about the State.
At Sacramento they will be enter
tained by the Sacramento Valley De
velopment Association.
Mrs. Keller left Santa Monica on Fri
day night. It was late when the train
reached Santa Barbara, and the sleep
ers in the Pullman did not see a thin
woman with a haggard look on her
face quickly enter the train and, by
previous arrangement, deposit a small
bundle done up in brown paper
in a vacant seat near Mrs. Kel
ler. With the bundle came bot
tle of milk and a change of
baby clothes. The child proved the pos
sessor of a pair of lungs that would
do Justice to a college rooter. It began
to cry. Passengers turned over in their
berths and growled.
Baby Rlnden refused to be solaced.
When the train reached San Francisco
yesterday morning Mrs. Keller figured
that she had had enough and started
out to lose the child. She went to the
Salvation Army headquarters, but they
did not want the mite. She traveled to
a foundling asylum on Mission street,
near Twelfth, without being able to rid
herself of her burden. Finally, in de
spair, she sought the Hall of Justice
and told her tale to Sergeant Moffltt,
who, realizing that Captain Frank
Norman was a fatherly man, referred
the embarrassed woman to him. Mrs.
Keller told Norman that the child had
been left on the train at Santa Bar
bara and she did not know to whom It
belonged.
Captain Norman sent her to the As
sociated Charities, where Miss Kate
Felton and Mrs. C. A. Clivo accepted
the woman's story and the child. Later
they became suspicious and notified
Captain Martin, who detailed Detective
Ryan on. the case. He arrested Mrs.
Keller as she was about to resume her
Journey to St. Louis on the 6 p. m.
train last night. When brought before
Martin Mrs. Keller frankly told the
whole story and was allowed to go her
way, with an admonishment not to
adopt any more lusty-lunged young
sters and bring them to San Francisco.
The baby willl be retained by the Asso
ciated Charities and placed in some
home.
"Wanted â Some responsible person to
adopt a blue-eyed bouncing baby girl.
Its father has a cataract of tho eye
and is unable to support the child. Ad
dress Mr. and Mrs. T. Rlnden, Monte
cito', Santa Barbara County."
Such was an advertisement that ap
peared in a recent edition of the Los
Angeles Times.
Mrs. Louise Keller, who resides at
Santa Monica and who says that her
husband Is a mining man at Nome,
answered the ad and secured the
child. The blue-eyed baby's stay
with ehr was of short duration.
Mrs. Keller and her husband had
longr. wished for a child, and when
she read the ad the desire to possess
a child returned to her. She corre
sponded with the father and mother.
She had planned a trip to St. Louis
while her husband was in Alaska, and
thought the company of the child
would enliven the journey. It did; and
thereby hangs a tale, wherein the As
sociated Charities and the Police De
partment figure prominently.

Marchant From Pine-Street
Rooming Place.
A sequel to the suit begrun on Fri
day by Phoebe Greene, Involving a
question of borrowed money and own
ership of the lodging-house at 1304
Pine street, appeared yesterday In a
complaint filed in the Superior Court
by the money lender, ' Louise J.
Francis, against Lilllemarie Marchant.
Mrs. Francis declares that she noti
fied Mrs. Marchant, as agent for her*
that she would take possession of the
property on July 1 and gave another
notice on June 27 that Mrs. Marchant
would have to give up possession of
the house on the first of the month.
It is also alleged that Mrs. Marchant
now refuses to surrender the house
and fraudulently claims to be the
owner thereof. Therefore Mrs. Francis
asks the court to allow her $80 a
month for each month the defendant
occupies the premises.
ANOTHER SUIT BEGUN
IN LODGING-HOUSE CASE
Richards' Case Argued.
The motion for a new trial in the
case of Edward Richards, convicted
by a jury in Judge Lawlor's court on
a charge of manslaughter, was argued
yesterday. The Judge reserved his de
cision till next Saturday. Richards
shot and killed Joseph Martini, saloon
keeper, 623 Pacific street, on January
6 during a dispute over the payment
for two bottles of beer. He was tried
for murder, but the Jury convicted
him of manslaughter. The new trial
is asked for chiefly on the ground that
two of the jurors did not hear the
whole of the Judge's Instructions and
that the verdict was a compromise
one.

Jacob Stelner, a driver for the Bay
City Market, very deliberately and very
coolly ended his life yesterday with a
revolver bullet because he believed that
paralysis was about to set In, perma
nently crippling his legs, and that he
would be deprived of the power of earn
ing his living.
Steiner had been In the habit every
morning of stopping for a drink at the
grocery at 1016 Polk street. Yesterday
morning he drove up to the grocery and
left his team standing In front while
he entered the place. He took two
drinks of whisky, after which he re
marked to R. T. Â¦Williams, who was
behind the bar, that he was about to
start for Chicago, and bade "Williams
good-by. He gave Williams a $5 piece
and told him to let Mrs. Stelner, bis
wife, have It when she called. Then
he went to the toilet in the rear and
shortly thereafter a pistol shot was
heard. Williams, suspecting what had
happened, called Policeman McLean,
who found Stelner dead with a cheap
revolver in his hand. There was a bul
let wound In the right temple and one
chamber of the weapon had been emp
tied.
Mrs. Stelner called at the Coroner's
office after she had been Informed of
the suicided She said she knew of no
cause for the rash deed except that her
husband had been attacked with symp
toms of paralysis In his legs and that
he had been alarmed recently by the
symptoms attacking his feet. When he
left home at 5:30 o'clock In the morn
ing he kissed his three little children
good-by In a manner much more af
fectionate than usual. He was born
In Baltimore, Md., thirty years ago.

alleges that he has been guilty of ex
treme cruelty on numerous occasions.
They were married at Chicago Febru

that there is 51350 in a mortgage,
which is community property. Besides
a, divorce and the restoration of her
property rights she asks the court to
restrain Johnson from annoying and
insulting her.

CLAIMS CRUELTY EXTENDS
OVER LAST TWO YEARS
The Supreme Court has decided that
Thomas Moran must go to the peniten
tiary for complicity in the murder of
George. W. Rica. The defendant's ar
guments are- considered one by ons In
the opinion, but no error in tha pro
ceedings is found. He Is the third of
tho murderous quartet whose aentenc*
has been affirmed.
Moran asserted that ht supposed his
accomplices wen* intending to beat a
non-union man and he denied all
knowledge of a conspiracy. The court
holds that his guilt- is proved by the
evidence that he boarded the car with
the other three assassins, that he
alighted when Rice was assaulted and
that he ran with his fellow criminals
after the murder had been committed.
Moran received a sentence of life im
prisonment at Folsom.
Rice was murdered on October 11,
1901. Ho was employed as a non-union
machinist In a factory on the water
front. Moran, Buckley. Donnolly and
Duncan boarded a Howard 'street car
on which Rice was riding, and when
the non-union I man alighted at Twen
tieth and Howard streets ho was
knocked down and shot. The murder
ers fled, but were easily apprehended
end brought to trial.
Buckley did the shooting. Moran Is
supposed to have knocked Rice down.
Duncan and Donnolly stood by to help
in case of need. Arthur Cleve, a Mr.
Platt and the tatter's daughter posi
tively identified the guilty men at their
respective trials.., All four were con
victed on a Friday. Buckley was sen
tenced to death. Donnolly to nineteen
years* Imprisonment and Duncan to
seventeen years' imprisonment. Three
of the murderers were shown at the
trial to be union men. The crime was
committed at the time of the machin
ists' strike.
Two more victims of the busy hold
up man who Is now enjoying an open
and lucrative season in this city were
treated at the Harbor Receiving Hos
pital during the early hours of yester
day morning. Both victims were sea
faring men and each bore bruises more
or less serious to corroborate his tale of
highway robbery and both made invol
untary contributions to the footpad
harvest.
George Davis, a fireman on the army
transport Logan, was tho lesser loser
by 52, but what he saved by not having
as much money as the other victim
was more than balanced by the greater
injury he received in his encounter with
the knights of the road.
Davis was held up at the corner of
Mission and Steuart streets. He had
been drinking, he says, and was some
what under the influence of the stimu
lant. He was heading for a lodging
house when a young man stepped
across his path, stuck a grtn in his face
and demanded the fireman's money.
Without waiting for a response the
highwayman batted his victim about
the head and face with the revolver,
then went through the pockets of the
dazed and bleeding fireman. Davis
says the robber got at least 59.
At the hospital Davis' injuries are
summed up as follows: Laceration of
the chin; abrasion, contusion and frac
ture of the lower Jaw; fracture and
abrasion of the nose.
Charles Brown, a sailor of the United
States revenue cutter Daniel Manning,
was the other victim. He lost 511, and,
in addition to a badly battered nose,
had his lower lip split from ons corner
of his mouth to the other.
Brown was held up twice. As he re
members, it was about 1 o'clock a. m.
He had turned down Pacific street
from Kearny when, two men stepped
out of a doorway and attacked him.
They knocked him down and out and
took 511 from his pockets.
When he recovered consciousness, he
says, he could not stand up. Feeling
in his pockets he discovered 75 cents
that the robbers had overlooked, but
had barely made the discovery when a
man approached him..
"Got any money?" asked the new ar
rival.
"None of your business," replied the
tar.
Thereupon the newcomer kicked the
sailor in the face and helped himself to
the remaining fraction of a dollar.
Brown was discovered, lying uncon
scious, by a shipmate, who gave him a
tow to the Harbor Hospital and later
piloted him back to Sausallto, where
the Manning swings at anchor.
City's Revenue Is Greater
Owing to Higher Valua
tions Tut on Iteal Estate
Assessor Dodge yesterday filed with
thÂ© Board of Supervisors his annual
report, showing that the assessment
roll for 1904 aggres-tes the sum of
55U.000.414, an increase of 583,500,000
over that for 1S03. The report fol
lows:
"July 5, 1804.
"To the Honorable Board of Super
visors of the City and County of San
Francisco:
"Gentlemen â The assessment roll for
1904. which Is herewith delivered to you,
shows a phenomenal increase over that
of last year. This increase amounts to
5S3.500.000. bringing the taxable prop
erty in this city up to 5511.000,414.
"As a result of this large increase,
your honorable board has recently been
enabled to reduce the tax rate eight
cents on the hundred. Notwithstand
ing this reduction in the rate, there will
still be at your disposal, owing to this
increased roll, about a million dollars,
raised by taxation, in excess of the sum
which was available last year. This
excess has been abt-ut equally divided
between permanent public improve
ments and tho necessary interest and
sinking fund for the proposed public
ijnprovement bond.
TAX KATE IS LOWTK.
"The full sisnificar.ee of this increas
ed roll will be comprehended when we
reflect that, were our municipal ex
penditures this year no greater than
those of last year, instead of a dollar
rate for running expenditures, as pro
vided by the charter, the tax rate for
this purpose would have been but
eighty-five cents. As it is, the total
tax rate for this year for all purposes,
municipal and State, will probably be
less than that of last year owing to
this increased assessment roll.
"Six years ago the assessment roll
of this city was $352,000,000. To this
there has been added during my term
554.000,000 of personal property and
5105,000,000 of real estate, giving us the
present roll of $511,000,000. This In
crease in the assessment roll gives to
the city at the dollar rate of taxation
a yearly revenue of one and a half mil
lions of dollars greater than that which
it formerly had.
REAL ESTATE EQUALIZED.
"The Increase in the roll this year
is due entirely to the increase made
in the assessed valuation of real es
tate. Real estate, however, has not
been uniformly increased, but it has
been equalized, so that in all parts of
the city it is now assessed on the same
basis of valuation. The main increase
has fallen on that real estate, the value
of which, during the past few years,
has Bteadily increased.
"In addition to making this assess
ment, this office has, during the past
ninety days, collected and turned into
the city treasury the sum of $660,000
as taxes on unsecured personal prop
erty.
"In conclusion, it is gratifying to
know that our city finances are now
on a sound basis. Deficits and unpaid
obligations are now unknown. With
our present revenues, raised by a mod
erate tax rate, we should be able to
provide many necessary public im
provements as well as to beautify our
city without Incurring in every In
stance a bonded indebtedness.
"Very respectfully yours,
"WASHINGTON DODGE.
"Assessor."

SENTENCE IS FOR LIFE
INCREASE IS ENORMOUS
JAW OF (^TE IS BROKEN
Policeman O'Callahan was patrol
ling Bpear-street wharf about 8
o'clock yesterday morning when there
gradually came to his alert hearing a
eound mingled harshly with the noc
turne murmured by tha wavelets lap
ping the timbers underneath him. In
raucous , and prolonged crescendo it
attained C sharp, camped there about
two seconds, then descended tho scale
in unbroken guttural until it expired in
an abrupt sob that reminded the
listener of tha dying note, of a bath
tub exhaust pipe. O'Callahan traced
the discords to a cask that lay half
burled in a heap of ecraplron, and,
with the aid of a lighted match, ha
found tightly wedged within the bar
rel a sleeping man.
After vainly endeavoring to awake
the snorer by kicking the barrel and
shouting,' "Getoutathere," the patrol
man thrust his right > hand Into the
queer resting place, grasped a luxuriant
beard and pulled and tugged with
might and main. Soma whiskers
cams out, but still the alumberer
awoke not, nor did the snore diminish.
Then the assistance of the wharf
watchman and an ax were procured
and by demolishing the cask the man
was finally brought to light and con
sciousness.
In tho corridors of tha Hall of Jus
tice yesterday morning a story was
afloat to tha effect that a gang of bay
pirates had barreled a drunken man
and were proceeding to cast him into
the bay, their object being to obtain
the $10 which is paid for the recovery
of a drowned body, when their plan
was frustrated by the abrupt appear
ance of O'Callahan, who routed the
would-be assassins and rescued their
Intended victim. In the court of Judge
Mogan, however, the story herein
before narrated was told by Police
man O'Callahan and corroborated In
part by the man from whom he took
the barrel and who said his name
was George Long, of no settled occu
pation.
"How did you happen to Imprison
yourself In the barrel?" the court in
quired.
â¢The truth of it is," replied Mr.
Long, nervously toying with the por
tion of his chin that had been de
nuded of whiskers, "that I was dead
sober when I entered that barrel, not
knowing that it had contained whisky.
Well, sir, so heavily were tho staves
of that barrel saturated with booze
and so strong were the fumes there
from that the first thing I knew I
knew nothing. I Just Inhaled the most
complete drunk of my career â and In
my time I've had some thorough heats
on. The whisky fumes must have
bloated me until I filled the barrel.
It's JuBt a case of plain drunk, ac
quired in an extraordinary manner,
and I hope the court won't regard it
as anything more serious than that."
Mr. Long's plea might have pre
vailed If a message from the booking
department had not described him as
a confirmed opium fiend and utterly
worthless "bum," so the Judge gave
him three months. .

When the police posse commanded
by Sergeant Gaston raided the prem
ises occupied by Eugene Retuss, 765
Market street, in quest of games and
gamesters Policeman Tillman posted
his herculean form at the door, flour
ished his trusty club and announced
that death would surely be the lot of
any Inmate who attempted to escape.
So menacing was the man's appear
ance and manner that Joseph Lep
ping, Harry Pollock. Arthur Wilson,
Edward Downey and Eugene Retuss
himself actually felt grateful to the
other policemen who placed them un
der arrest and thus assured them of
immunity from demolition by that
terrible club.
While the defendants were not
caught in the act of gambling the im
plements with which craps and other
games of chance are played were
found In the room and bore signs of
having been in very recent service.
Judge Fritz continued tho cases till
July 8.
* â¢ â¢
When the flfteen-months-old babe
of Policeman Berrle and wife was In
trusted to the care of Margaret Man
ning the parents had no misgiving, be
cause the nurse was' middle aged and
apparently of settled habits. For a
month they had no reason to suspect
that their confidence was misplaced
and even then disillusion might not
have come If payment of Mary's sal
ary had been /postponed. She had
her month's wages, however, when
she took the Infant out in' its buggy
for the usual afternoon airing. It was
evident that a considerable portion of
the money had been expended for in
toxicating drink when Patrolman
Wlnslow arrested her at Bryant and
Harriet streets and booked her for
cruelty to children.
"She was so drunk," said the com
plaining policermn to Judge Mogan,
"that while I was watching her and
ere I could prevent it. she upset the
buggy and dumped out the baby no
less than three times. The little one
would have been killed If I hadn't
run her In."
The parents of the rescued' child
had nothing to Bay, except to express
regret that they had not more fully
investigated Mary's character before
allowing her to go abroad with the
dearest thing they have , on earth.
When the investigation ordered by the
court has been completed Mary will
know JuBt how long she will have to
remain a prisoner.
Five young fellows arrested for be
ing inmates of an opium den at 831
Sacramento street are held by order
of Judge Mogan until District Attoiy
ney Byington can appear and explain
Just how they can /be punished under
the law. The statute provides that In
order to secure conviction it must be
proved that opium has actually been
sold or given away, and this cannot
be proven in the case in question. A
municipal ordinance, intended to rem
edy the defects of the statutes, pro
vides that it Is unlawful to visit a
place where opium is smoked, which
can be proved in this caseT But the
ordinance was recently pronounced
invalid by Superior Judge Lawlor on
the ground that it placed defendants
twice in Jeopardy, as they could be
prosecuted under the State as well as
the municipal law. The matter Is
likely to ba threshed out In court next
Tuesday.

JufljjÂ© Conlan pronounced J. Porelson
guilty of practicing optometry without
having first provided himself with the
certificate of competency demanded by
the State, and W. M. Maguire, special
prosecutor In the case, earned some
prestlgo as the attorney who secured
the first conviction under the new law.
Sentence will bs postponed till next
Wednesday.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Judge Fritz continued till Tuesday
the case of 17-year-old Herbert Ja
cobs, accused* of battery. Patrolman J.
Galloway testified that the boy was not
looking ahead of him as he ran swiftly
around the corner of the Palace Hotel
at Market and New Montgomery
streets, and that when the woman with
whom he collided was extricated from
the mlx-up her silk dress was torn to
ribbons. The defendant declare* the*
collision was unavoidable.
William Hammet didn't exactly re
member what prompted him to bom
bard with rocks and flsts the doors of
various houses In Bartlett allejr, but
was Inclined to think that his Inspira
tion was moral, because In his sober
moments he had often grieved over the
futile efforts of Chief of Police Wlttman
to close up the city's disreputable
houses. He had no fault to find with
Policeman Farrell for arresting him,
because he knew that his conduct was
law-breaking, but he hoped that Judge
Mogan would take Into consideration
the character of the places he assailed
and the probable motive that actuated
him. The Judga promised to think it
over.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Policeman Curtln told how he rushed
the lino of pickets thrown out by the
director general of the crap game In
the alley back of the Palace Hotel, and
how he managed to bag 12-year-old
Â¦Willie Curtln, while a dozen other Juve
nile knights of chance escaped by run*
ning. The young gamesters, mostly
newsboys, had made so much noise as
to annoy certain hotel guests, whoso
complaint to the management resulted
In Curtln being specially detailed by
Chief Wlttman to break up the game
and arrest as many of the gamesters
as he could catch. Willie's aged mother
appeared In court and made such an
eloquent appeal In her son's behalf that
Judge Mogan suspended sentence and
advised Willie to stick to marbles*
Max Kantowltz, charged with cruelty
to animals, took his alleged horse to the
Hall of Justice and Invited Judge Mo
gan to step downstairs and see for him
self whether the animal was In such a
dilapidated condition as Policeman
Hooper had alleged. "When the Judge
arrived at the sidewalk he casually In
quired whose automobile It was that
stood In front of the hall entrance, and
Officer Hooper explained that it ' was
hot a chug- chug machine, but the Kan
towltz horse,, that confronted his
Honor.
"That a horse 1" exclaimed the Judge
after rubbing his eyes and gazing long
and eearchlngly at the strange-appear
ing and inanimate structure. Then he
acknowledged that It did bear soma
Blight resemblance to equine anatomy,
and when he returned to his bench Mr.
Kantowltz was discharged and the
thing at the door sentenced to Imme
diate transformation Into chicken feed.
With a knotted rops end Florence
McCarthy was disciplining a revolu
tionary Eteed on the main driveway of
Golden Gate Park when he was arrest
ed for cruelty to an animal, and when
he failed to respond to the calling of
his name In Judge Mogan's court his
$10 ball was declared forfeited.

FROM SANTA CLARA VAIXET.
The people of San Francisco are
making extraordinary efforts to enter
tain the visitors who will attend the
triennial conclave of the Knights
Templar next September. But the bur
den as well as the pleasure of enter
taining will be shared by the people
from the interior and from. the entire
coast, from the. boundary line of the
Dominion of Canada to the Mexican
frontier, and from the Rocky Moun
tains to the sea. Never before has there
been such zeal to welcome the visitors,
or to show the advantages of all sec
tions of the Pacific Slope, as is xnanl
fested on this occasion.
The executive committee, entertain
ment committee and other committees
are busy preparing for the reception
and entertainment of the visiting Sir
Knights. These committees are in
daily receipt of information advising
them of the coming of commanderies
and delegations from California, Ore
gon, Washington and other sections of
the slope. The display to be made in
San Francisco will alone be worth the
trip across the continent and visitors
will be able to gather much informa
tion and see as much of the wonderful
products of California, Oregon, Wash
ington, Nevada, Arizona and the rest
of the coast as if they had traveled
through the mountains and valleys for
six months.
TO "EXHIBIT COAST PRODUCTS.
From every section of the country
the choicest and best it produces will
be. brought to San Francisco and ex
hibited to the visitors who will come
from all. parts of the United States,
Canada and from across the Atlantic
Nearly every commandery will keep
open house during the/week and will
have courteous Sir Knights and ladles
to entertain visitors \ and show them
the exhibit of the section of the coun
try where the commandery Is station
ed. The Mechanics' Pavilion, the prin
cipal halls and the leading hotels in
the city will be transformed into places
of exhibition, where souvenirs are to
be given to visitors, and there will be
an abundance of these.
Fresno Commandery No. 29 will be
represented at the conclave by about
seventy-five swords and will have its
headquarters in some central hall,
probably the Pythian Castle on Market
street, near Fifth, where 'it will estab
lish reception rooms and armory. The
commandery does not propose to install
a full exhibit k of Fresno's famed pro
ducts, but will have a few things grown
In and near Fresno to give to its vis
itors as souvenirs.
One of these will be a box of seeded
raisins in a Templar carton, designed
and made for the triennial. The com
mandery will keep its doors wide open
during its sojourn in â¢ San . Francisco
sociated and will have Joint headquar
ters in the Pavilion, where they will en
tertain and display the choice products
from their soil, fields and mines. Ne
vada Commandery No. 6 will bring It3
wonderful exhibit of rich minerals, with.
Its pyramid of pure gold and a bushel
of golden nuggets. The resources of
that section being little known outslda
of California, these exhibits will be a
revelation to visitors from other parts
of the country and a valuable object
Ies3pfc to those who visit California for
the ffrst time.
The alleged fraudulent prosecutions
TWENTY COMPIiAINTS.
In proceeding with their alleged
fraudulent purposes, he says, the de
fendants concealed evidence, obtained
unreasonable continuances of trials, for
ten years falsely posted Ader as insane
and Lapique as a criminal of the deep
est dye, neglected and refused to fol
low his instructions in trials with a
view of extorting money from him, cor
ruptly influenced certain police magis
trates to withhold material evidence,
corrupted Jurors to convict him and
procured certain Judges of doubtful
character to hold him. to answer, in
flicted cruel punishment on him,' ob
structed and opened his mail, resisted
and delayed judicial officers in the dis
charge of thejr duties and employed at
torneys of their own selection to de
fend the plaintiff In civil and criminal
actions.
Lapique alleges that the defendants
conspired to control the business affairs
of himself and Ader and to manipulate
thP plaintiff's interests to suit them
selves. These manipulations are said
to have resulted In loss to the "con
spirators" and the plaintiff. Ader died
March 2, 189C. Lapique says, too, that
the confederates demanded $10,000 from
him, which he refused to pay.
He then declares that for seventeen
years past, during most of which time
he has been in Jail, the defendants have
been contriving and maliciously in
tending to Injure him and the late
Jean Louis Ader, the said incompetent.
In that period they are alleged to have
caused the arrest of Lapique and Ader
three times for insanity, one for grand
larceny, four times for embezzlement,
once for perjury, twice for misdemean
ors, four times for obtaining money un
der false pretenses, three times for for
gery and about four times on civil ac
tions.
Under the charges and on the occa
sions named Ader and Lapique were
under arrest or sentence for most of the
time for seventeen years up to January
7 of this year, when Lapique says he
was finally released and "acquitted" of
all the charges. Each charge, he says,
was made for the purpose of "annoy
ing, oppressing and impoverishing him
and Ader, and Ader's estate after his
death." He has, he alleges, been de
famed, imprisoned and disgraced, and
the purpose of his prosecutors was to
"obtain corruptly attorney's fees and
other moneys."
MUCH TIME IN" JAIL.
Forty-eight typewriten pages set
forth the general complaint and twenty
specific complaints upon which La
pique seeks to recover more than half
a 'million. As defendants he names

attorneys at law, heirs, guardians, re
ceivers, administrators, copartners,
clerks, agents, deputy sheriffs, trus
tees, intimate friends and relatives of
the plaintiff and of Jean Louis Ader, an
Incompetent, now deceased.
Lapique first sets forth that he has
lived in California for twenty-one
years and since he was seventeen years
old. He is the owner, he declares of
two bank books of Jean Louis Ader, of
the business of J. Lapique & Co., deal
ers in pickled meats at stall 56, Central
Market, 724 Vallejo street, 335% Third
street and 1165 Market " street, and of
the Silver King lodging-house at 514
Bush street.
The records of the California courts
contain nothing more astonishing than
the complaint fifed yesterday by John
Lapique, a pork-packer and hotel-keep
er, against forty-four persons, who, he
says, are responsible in different ways
for his malicious prosecution during
the last seventeen years. He Is his own
attorney and asks the court to award
him $650,000 damages for ruined busi

A special correspondent who had
unusual opportunities for observing
the recent burning of the Delaware. ]
Lackawanna and Western piers while
plying on the North River in front of
Hoboken, reported that every spec
tator was impressed with the efficient
manner in which the adjacent steel
piers arrested the further progress of
the fire and prevented its spread along
the river front. Without in any way
minimizing the need of modern fire
boats and the good work of the met
ropolitan fire departments, property
owners and public officials realize the
necessity of building all new wharf
structures with fire-resisting materi
als, and steel, in conjunction with con
crete, has proved its wonderful ef
ficiency in preventing and retarding
serious conflagrations. Gustav H.
Schwab of the North German Lloyd
Company recently stated to the New
York Tribune that the . steel piers
which they built after the 1900 dis
aster were not only constructed as
fireproof as could be devised, but they
have also been an advantage in an
economical way, as they withstand the
elements and reduce the cost of re
pairs to a minimum. Dock Commis
sioner Featherson approved the con
struction of the eight new piers in the
Chelsea extension, as well as the other
piers built within the last seven years,
all of which are constructed with steel
sheds. E. E. Loomis, vice president
of the Delaware, Lackawanna and
Western Railway, stated that his road
intended to replace the burned prop
erty with modern flrenroof structures,
which will undoubtedly comprise
much steel. It is also understood that
other cities are following the lead of
New York in the erection of steel
piers and wharf sheds, among which

J. Drummond MacGavin, the crack
player of tlie California Tennia Club,
carried oft the honors yesterday at San
Rafael. MacGavin won the tournament
with ease. At no time was he in dan
ger of losing a match. He was at his
best, and men like George Baker and
Clarence Griffin stood absolutely no
show against him. In the finals Griffin
Â¦won the third set from MacGavln, but
the latter had annexed the first two bo
easily he became careless, and his
ycur.ger opponent was not slow to take
advantage of the let up. In the fourth
and final set MacGavln again settled
down to hard play and won out easily.
Clarence Griffin of the Golden Gate
Club secured a place in the finals by
p!ayir.g a steady, accurate game. In
the semi-finals he disposed of Herbert
Long: without an effort. Long played
excellent tennis in the early rounds. He
has beaten Griffin in practice regularly
of late. Despite this fact Griffin went
into the match with great confidence,
and by playing constantly at the net
beat Long almost as he pleased. Long
was rather footsore and considerably
off in his game.
The semi-final match between Mac-
Gavin and George Baker was the best
of the day. Many thought Baker would
win, but his safe "get-back" game
availed him naught against the hard
hitting, accurate game of MacGavin.
The latter used a swift chop, of which
he seemed to have perfect control. He
rarely drove, and then only when it be
came necessary- His service was strong
and xvon ace after ace for him. Baker
tried hard and played a good game, but
MacGavin was much too strong for
him. looker, like Long, was troubled
some by blistered feet. MacGavin won
in straight sets, the score being 6â L
6-4. frâ 3.
In the morning Carl Gardner won an
unfinished match from Frank Mitchell.
Kach had won a set on Friday, and the

AMERICAN SALVATIONISTS
WELL RECEIVED IX LONDON
Ovation Greets Arrival of Delegates
From United States to Army's
Congress In England.
LONDON, Julv 2. â The American
delegation to the Salvation Army Con
gress spent to-day In sight-seeing,
there being no important meetings at
the International Hall, on the Strand.
Commander Booth-Tucker, . head of the
American delegation, said:
"The Salvation Army International
Congress beggars description. Im
mense crowds throng therÂ© daily and
watch the delegates. With their na
tional colors and numerous braes
bands they march through the prom
inent streets dally. The attendance at
the Strand and Exeter Halls average
15,000 to 20.000 daily. Nine extra the
aters and town halls have been en
gaged for Sundays, besides the large
army halls. The aggregate of a large
Sunday attendance is more than a
hundred thousand and tens of thous
ands are unable to gain admission.
"A splendid spirit of unity and broth
erhood exists among the national rep
resentatives, the Germans, French,
Italians, Dutch, Swiss, Scandinavians,
Russians, Japanese, Chinese and Hin
doos fraternizing with each other.
About 500 conversions were recorded
last Sunday.
"The American delegation was gladly
received. The staff, the band, in cow
boy costume: the Kentucky outriders
and the choir of colored songsters re
ceived grand ovations."
Ever since the middle of February
the shad fishermen have been prepar
ing for the opening of the season on
the Delaware. While the river was full
of ice the veteran fisherman, Captain
Rice, had his men at work getting the
immense net ready, calking the boats
and repairing the houses in which the
little army of shad fishermen are shel
tered during the season. As soon as
the river was sufficiently clear of ice
the preliminary and all important work
of cleaning up the flotsam and jetsam
so as to leave the fishing ground free
for the net was begun.
It takes weeks of hard work to clear
up the debris of a winter. The Dela
ware shad fishing grounds are the
graveyard of all the floating wreckage,
old junk and miscellaneous rubbish
that finds its way down the river, and
the shad fishermen have a ghastly
time of it during the cleaning-up per
iod.
CURIOUS THINGS FOUND.
Every foot of the river has to be gone
over. The process of cleaning up
brings to the surface broken benches
from some of the riverside parks, sofas
without legs and legs without sofas,
chairs without backs and backs with
out chairs, dilapidated tables, packing
boxes innumerable, empty bottles by
the thousand, planks studded with jag
ged nails, remnants of baskets, odds
and ends of sodden wearing apparel
and sometimes an unrecognizable body
that has lain at the bottom of the
river all the winter hiding the story of
a murder or suicide.
When the river is cleared of the rub
bish so that the big net can be cast
without fear of its being ripped to
pieces during the process of hauling in
the shad fishermen are ready to begin
work. The sight is so picturesque that
hundreds go down to Gloucester to see
the net cast.
Captain Rice, the veteran shad fish
erman, employs the services of sev
enty-five men, and these are assisted
by no less than eight horses during
the hauling of the nets. Two casts are
made daily. It takes so long to cast
the net and draw It in that It is im
possible to make, more than two casts
a day.
NET LARGEST IN THE WORLD.
The huge net, the biggest in the
world, is two miles long. That is to
say, the net itself is a mile long and
the ropes that, support it are another
mile in length, half a mile on either
side of the net proper, so that the
operations of the fishermen cover a
distance of not less than two miles
every time the net is cast.
In the middle the net is thirty feet
deep, tapering to ten feet at other parts.
After the net has been properly cast
it. requires the united exertions of the
men and the eight horses for one
perspiring hour before the haul is
brought near shore.
A huge "boat with a double row bt
oarsmen is the craft used to take the
net out for the casting.
When the experienced men have
loaded the net on the boat the captain
of the casters directs the oarsmen
where to row for the attempt, and
having selected his ground, he throws
the end of the net overboard and pays
it out as the men row away. When
every foot is thrown from the boat the
signal is given to the haulers and the
work of dragging in the net is begun.
HAULING IN THE CATCH.
After an almost interminable amount
of pulling at an apparently endless
rope the network begins to show Itself
on the surface of the water. By and
by the 'men set hold of the rope that
holds the net and then the Delaware
begins to look like a river ruffled by a
tremendous hail storm. The surface is
churned into foam by the frantic ef
forts of thousands of fish to break
through the net. The smaller fish are
able to get away through the wide
meshes of the net. Some of the shad
even escape by jumping boldly out of
the water . and getting Into safe water
over the too of the net. C
Slowly the net nears the. shore with
its struggling mass of silvery shad, and
Captain Rice" drops his sing-song and
prepares for action. His orders to the
men are sharp" 'and snappy. Careless
ness at this stage means, the loss of
valuable fish, for if the ropes are not
held taut the shad can escape over the
top. Sometimes the veteran leaves his
post between the lines and takes a
hand himself at the hauling. As soon,
however, as ; the fish begin to come
within- seizing distance Captain Rice
takes the center of, the stage, so to
speak, for no one but the leader and
his trusted lieutenants handle the fish.
A boat is propelled, Into the middle of
the mass of shad, now in comparative
ly shallow I' water, \ and ; the fish are
caught and thrown into the boat.
-They are usually so numerous i that
they can be picked up by hand from
the meshes of the net. When the
catch seems to be all In the'boat the
net is : hauled .up, the last Â¦ remaining
stragglers taken out of the meshes and
deposited with their friends and rela
tives In the boat, and the net is Imme

fatally shot by a burglar whom he sur
prised in his house on his return home
about 9:30 o'clock to-night. Adams
and wife had returned from a shop
ping trip and going round to the back

noises in the house and Mrs. Adams
shouted burglars. The couple then
went around to the front of the house
and as they turned the corner saw a
man leaving by the window. He had
a revolver In his hand. Adams rushed
up to grapple with him and as he
reached the man the burglar fired. The
burglar then rushed down Balbach
street toward the Guadalupe Creek.

FAST GAME AT TACOMA.
Thomas Presents a Varied Assortment
of Curves to the Angels.
TACOMA, July 2.â The Tigers took a
fast and an exclMng game to-day
which broke the time record in Tacoma,
being played in one hour and twenty
minutes. Thomas presented an assort
ment of curves the like of which Los
Angeles has not met in many daysand
two hits were the extent of their stick
work. One of these was Chase's fly
over the left field fence which counted
as a home run. It would have been
an easy out on larger grounds. After
this hit Los Angeles never saw first
base except in the seventh. Hall was
hit hard but was accorded high class
support. Wheeler threw out McLaugh-

Aesistant Secretary of State Loomis
will receive Monday a typewritten let
ter of over a dozen pages from William
H. Ellis, who accompanied Loomis
from New York, covering the most
minute details of his brother's doings
up to the time of his disappearance.
Although Ellis declined to publicly
discuss the case, he told the officials
that he last saw Loomis between 10 and
11 o'clock at night as the steamer en
tered Plymouth.
A letter has been sent to Bremen di
recting that official Inquiries be made
in regard to the whereabouts of the
lady and gentleman who were seen sup
porting Loomis shortly before the
Kaiser Wilhelm's arrival at Plymouth.
PARIS. July 2.â The American Em
bassy and Consulate have given up
hope that F. Kent Loomis, who dis
appeared from the steamer Kaiser
WUhelm II, will be found alive. Let
ters to that effect have been forwarded
to the American State Department.
The letters recommend that a thorough
officia linquiry be made of the officers
of the KaisÂ«T Wilhelm II when the
steamer arrives Â«-t New York, as her
steps at Cherbourg, Southampton and
Plymouth are too brief to permit of of
ficial investigation.

SAYS MUNY BANDED TO CRUSH,
A Queen's Apparel for Lifetime.
An extremely Interesting addition Is
about to be made to the collection of
mementos of the late Queen Victoria
on view at Kensington Palace. In
turning out some of the rooms and
presses at Buckingham Palace, many
of the old bonnets, gloves, shoes and
other personal belongings of the lata
Queen have been found, as' well as the
coronation robes of 1837, The King has
now decided that these shall be sent
to Kensington Palace, where they .will
be placed in cases with dates attached.
There are one or two of the "mush
room hats" of which Queen Victoria
was so fond, as well as early Victorian
bonnets, and one which obviously be
longed to her Majesty when a mexo
girl.â Ladles' PlctorlaL
Dainties of the Russian Peasant.
The Russian peasant, even If the
bread he eats is black, has a bon
bouche to add to his meal much sought
by eoicures in the Western worldâ
the wild mushrooms, which grow thou
sands upon thousands on the steppes
of Russia. At any time a full and
savory meal Is provided with the addi
tion of sausage and onions; even .a
mushroom alone often contents them
for a meal with their coarse rye bread.
The poorest laborer has also a luxur
ious drink always available from the
ever present samovar, and the tea they
drink would be the envy of any Amer
ican-connoisseur of that beverage, for
the best of China's tea is found In
Russia and all classes enjoy Its quality
and fragrance. Never is the water al
lowed to stand on the tea over a few
moments, so none of the poisonous
tannin is extracted and a delightful,
mildly stimulating, straw-colored drink
is the result. It would be well If tha
Russian peasant would content himself
with this, for his only great vice is
drunkenness. â Social Service.
was again arrested for Insanity and
again discharged.
In conclusion and in his praver for
$550,000 damages, Lapique alleges that
his business of pork packer and hotel
keeper was worth JlO.OflD a year, and
because of the prosecutions and im
prisonment he was prevented from at
tending <o his business; that his health
was impaired and his reputation in-<
Jured because of the publicity given to
the various prosecutions.
It Is said that while In Jail, and after
his release, Laplctue devoted his time
to the study of law, with thÂ©
announced intention of suing those who
had prosecuted him.

Friendly Birds of Prey.
Every farmer and gamekeeper should
have a copy of the biological survey's
report on the stomachs of birds of
prey. Besides immense quantities of
mice, hawks and owls kill snakes, rats,
weasels, skunks and squirrels, all of
Â¦which species destroy more or less
young game birds and the eggs of
game birds. Therefore it becomes
necessary to know whether the bird
Â«jf prey himself or all these other ene
rhiea kill the most game before judg
ing of his harmfulness. The killing of
hawk or owl is probably almost always
the killing of one of your game pre
servers, whether or not he takes some
fame In pay. You might as well
abolish policemen because they some
times offend.
Sportsmen wage war against herons,
kingfishers and fish hawks. Now, since
it is well known that the main de
vourers of trout spawn 'end fry, for
Instance, are not any kind of bird, but
certain species of fish, you are probably
helping thin your trout by removing
these birds, since the latter doubtless
prey more on the spawn devourers
than on the trout. This is plain, be
cause trout are swifter and hence hard
er to catch and live commonly in
deeper water than other species; so
that what the heron and kingfisher get
are no doubt generally the enemies of
your troutâ Forest and" Stream. '

The Feminine Language.
You may talk to a woman for an
hour or more and understand every
word she says. Meat, bread, money,
motor-cars, drains, the ace of trumps
â there* is really no space at my dis
posal to give a list of the words that
are common to both languages. In
fact, most of the solid, concreta
things of life may be left out of the
question. It is when we pass beyond
the concrete that the real misunder
standing arises. Take a couple of
very common words used equally by
both sexes. A man will say that So
and-So Is a "nice" girl. I should
know what he meant. A woman will
reply that the girl is pretty, agree
able, and all that sort of thing â but
that she is "not quite nice." The two
are usinx the same word to expreÂ»3
different ideas, and they will never
agree as to whether that girl is nice
or otherwise until they can talk the
same language.
Again. In the feminine dictionary the
opposite of "nice" is '"horrid." A man
will talk of a "nice scoundrel" and a J
"horrid bore." and I can understand
him. But when a woman tells me that
a man is wealthy and clever and good
looking â "but I'm sure he's horrid" â
she has dropped into her foreign Ian- â¢
guage. I can only be sure that she
does not mean what I mean when I
speak of a "horrid girl."â London Out

Sturgeon Instead of Shad.
Just about now the flsaermen down
the bay axe putting aside their shad
nets and starting to fish for sturgeon.
This, to the housekeeper, may seem re
markable, inasmuch as shad are still
high priced and in big demand, largely
because the chilly condition of the
water has so far kept the shad from
running up stream in great numbers.
The fishermen know what they axe
about, however.
A good-sized cow sturgeon la worth
anywhere from K>0 to 530 and. onca
Killed, is not particularly hard to

Bargain Counter Ftfrte*.
That women really enjoy a scrim
mage with eaeh other, when no men
are by to see that they are not living
up to their blue china reputation for
tenderness. Is beyond doubt. Witness
the bargain counter rushes when*
women make an onslaught on a coun
ter of shirt waists. Are any oi the
virtues â the gentleness, the tender
ness, the sympathy for thÂ« weak and
needy â for which woman la so justly
famed, exhibited on such occasions to
women older, feebler, poorer and more
in need of bargains than herself. Nay.
verily. It Is a brutal struggle to get
the best, in which the feeble are
trampled under foot, gowns are torn
and hats smashed, a struggle in which
women of stature and grip do not
hesitate to snatch a bargain out of the
hands of another woman and bear It
off in triumph. In the peculiar creed
of ethics that governs a woman's con
duct toward her sister woman, it is
considered perfectly legitimate to
covet your neighbor's garments, or her
cook, and to get them away from her if
you can. â Everybody's Magazine.

Naturally, this "drummer" business
la not done too boldly, though nearly
every one In society knows about It.
Fashionable folk understand when they
arc urged to buy this or that- it is not
because of a desire that they may reap
some benefit, but that the aristocratic
agent may Increase the sale of her
goods. There is not one thing from a
paper of pins to a motor car or a pre
sentation at court for which women are
not taking up an agency, for society
women have been so swept up into the
vortex of money-making that if not
occupied with the fluctuations of stocks
and shares, they care not whether they
dabble in belt bucltles or automobiles,
laundry recommendations or prlma
donnas, so long as they draw a good
commission upon the results of their
efforts. And as a matter of fact, the
more unlikely as a commercial traveler,
from the point of view of position and
popularity a woman may seem, the
more assiduous is she in playing her
trade.
"I absolutely must sell some of Mr.
's black sheep for him, for if I
don't par her something Madame won't
make me a gown for the races."
"Would you* believe the duchess of
X has even been able to get that
awful man So-and-so into the Carlton
Club?" â¢:â¢
"Lady M lost twenty pounds at
bridge last night again, and she used
to be as poor as anything till the wore
So-and-so's hats for him."
That is what you hear in boudoir
chats.
One of the most famous of society
womenâ everybody in London could
identify herâ made Â£7000 recently
through selling City and Suburban mo
tors. Another makes a good thing out
oi recommending electric baths and also
by selling horses. And many a one
creeping up into society will do all
she can to get within touch of some
one who may be within reach of a cer
tain Duchess who is supposed to have
wonderful powers to get men into clubs
of high standing, women into circles
hitherto barred against them and all
into a position in society that would
be utterly impossible were the asplr
'ants not burdened with untold wealth.
It is all done for hard cash. No jewel,
no dainty trinket, no beautifully bound
books or even works of art are used to
make a delicate acknowledgment of
courtesies offered and accepted. A hard
cash payment is demanded and given.
A present might be awkward to ac
count for, It might not be to the re
cipient's taste. It Is money that al
ways is wanted, and that it shall be
promptly paid is the first stipulation
made by the titled aristocrat who con
stitutes herself the go-between, before
she pledges herself to us* her influ
ence.
It is said that the general rush to
be commercial travelers commenced
two or three seasons ago when the
wearing of barbaric looking bead neck
laces became the greatest of fads. Then
there was not a luncheon party where
men and women alike were not badger
ed by one or another of the guests to
buy these trifles. "Don't you think
they are Just too delightful. Lord So
and-So? You must have one for one
of your friends. I know such a nice
girl who makes them herself. She ]s so
clever at. it, and makes such pretty
ones. She is quite a little friend, of
mine." And probably the woman
made them herself, charging several
hundred per cent on the value of the
thing.
But when one of the season's favor
ite brides began to receive six to a
dozen of these trifles as wedding pres
ents, mostly of men who had bought
them for the sake of peace, the death
blow came to this Industry. But this
one line of business gave quite a fillip
i to society's trading instincts.

LONDON, July 2.â Although some
thing has been said in American news
papers about the way in which aristo
cratic London society women act as
"drummers" for tradesmen, on commis
sion, it probably is not even suspected
at home how far this sort of thins is
being carried on in Mayfair at present.
To go about from house to house
with puppy dogs under the arm to
make morning calls with a little packet
of samples, to take afternoon tea where
one is likely to meet the most probable
purchasers of pianolas, motor cars,
lamp shades, pedigreed sheep, etc., is
how many fashionable women in Lon
don spend half their time.
Beautiful, highly, o-rten nobly born
and well dressed they are, supposed to
be living in the lap of wealth and
luxury, supposed to scorn any one who
has ever strayed toward the outer, very
outside edge, of trade or commerce, but
notwithstanding, they are about the
most insistent of commercial travelers.
The two deserted homes are only a
couple of blocks apart. At 486 Thirty
fourth street is the Benedict home,
while at 586 Thirty-sixth street Mrs.
Hoag watches and waits. The blinds
are drawn in both homes.
Since the news transpired of the si
multaneous disappearance of the Rev.
Charles Wayland Hoag, pastor of the
Plymouth Congregational Chucrh, and
Mrs. William Nelson Benedict, wife of
a well-known commercial traveler, the
deserted husband and the abandoned
wife have .had no news from the miss
ing couple. Benedict says that on June
20 he put his wife on the train to go to
Orland, In Glenn County, for a visit.
Communication with the friends she
was to visit there has revealed the fact
that she never reached her destination.
On the same day the Rev. Mr. Hoag
left his home. Last Sunday he was to
have occupied the pulpit of the Rev.
William Rader. in San Francisco, but
at the final tolling of the bell Hoag was
not on hand and the service had to be
conducted by a lay member.
Benedict, disgusted with the actions
of his wife, has brought suit for di
vorce. Rumor for some time past has
connected the names of his wife and
the now missing preacher, who, the
neighbors say, was a frequent visitor
to the Benedict home. Both were be
lievers in socialism and it was through
this cult, rather "than the study of the
scriptures, that their Intimacy devel
oped into a passion.
Hoag, however, has a record. This
'is not the first time he has been in
difficulties. The storv of his present
escapade has brought to light an ex
perience which he had in Los Angeles
a few years ago. There scandal con
nected his name with that of a pretty
choir singer and Hoag was forced to
leave. He came to San Francisco,
where he turned Methodist, but after
ward went back to the Congregation
allsts. Prior to going to Los Angeles
he lived in Kansas and before that in
Michigan.
Mrs. Hoag, it is said, has been left
almost destitute. Her husband took
nearly every cent in the house, the
money he carried away amounting in
all to about $400. As an indication
that he did not intend to return, he
left his keys. His wife has since
changed the lock on the door. Bene
dict has visited Mrs. Hoag, and while
neither will say what their conclusions
are, friends assert that they are satis
fled that the preacher and Mrs. Bene
dict are together. Benedict is going to
cut loose promptly from his marital
experience by aid of the divorce court.
Mrs. Hoag has not decided what
course she will, pursue and hopes
against hope that the whole affair will
prove to be a terrible mistake. With
her is her young son, for whom she has
to care.

The remaining fragments of the col
lection represent parts of the skeletons
of the mastodon, bison, prehistoric
horse, wolves, modern bears, lynxes
and foxes. Nearly all of the specimens
gathered are dissociated, with - seldom
a complete skeleton. Associated parts
of the skeletons of a few squirrels and
wood rats, a snake and a bat were
found in the gravel layers.
"In all case*," Dr. Sinclair says, "the
bones have lost their organic matter
completely and adhere to the moisten
ed fingers like kaolin. Some of them
are weather cracked, indicating that
they lay for a time on the surface. Oc
casionally some of the large limb
bones were found. broken across, where
they had become Eoftened by. percolat
ing, water and were unable to support
the weight of the earth above them.
Many of the* bones have been gnawed
by rodents. The material requires no
preparation except to wash off the ad
hering clay. The bones are usually
white, but often show yellow and faint
blue dlscolorations."
At present no vertebrate animals ex
cept bats live within the perpetually
darkened portion of the cave. Wood
rafs nest near the entrance and birds
occupy the ledges. Some spiders of a
strange species, apparently sightless,
live on webs spread in the crevices In
the cave walls and on an altar at one
end of the cavern.
The Potter Creek cave consists of a
system of galleries lying in a belt of
limestone, on the north side of Potter
Creek, Shasta County, from which it
takes its name. It is 1500 feet above
sea level and about S00 feet above the
level of the McCloud River, which in
the prehistoric age swept past its
mouth. There is an arched entrance
communicating with a smaller cham
ber, through which admittance is
gained to a narrow passageway. Be
yond, this point is perpetual darkness.
Following this passage to the left, it is
found to terminate abruptly on the
margin of a great pit, where a conven
ient stalagmite pillar offers a secure
point of attachment for a rope ladder.
Upon descending forty-two feet the
explorer finds himself in a room 107
feet long. 30 feet wide and 75 feet high.
The floor of this great chamber was
covered with deposits of limestone,
gravel and volcanic ashes. Beneath this
envelope were entombed the animals
now exhumed. Excavating was car
ried on under the direction of the uni
versity scientists, who were compelled
to resort to blasting wherever the de
posit resisted the attacks of picks and
shovels.
In addition to the traces of primitive
man in California that' the Potter
Creek cave. In Shasta County, has
given to the scientists of the Univer
sity of California, the famous old cav
ern has been prolific in its yield of the
remains of extinct animals. The ac
count of the cave and its interesting
fauna that Dr. William J. Sinclair of
the anthropological department has is
sued contains a list of vertebrate spe
cies represented by remains exhumed
from beneath the limestone mantle of
the cave. Twenty-one of these are ex
tinct types.
Of this remarkable collection of
bones, composed of some 4600 frag
ments, the most interesting are the
skull and limbs of a large extinct bear,
classed as an unknown species. . Sev
eral complete limbs of this gigantic
beaet. -with all the elements in their
natural positions, were discovered em
bedded in the soft clay in the main
chamber of the cave.
Dr. Sinclair says that there is little
definite evidence indicating that the
animal lived in any. of the existing
galleries of the cave, and aa it could
not easily have climbed into the cham
ber where its remains were found, it is
possible that it fell in, succumbing In
time to the ravages of hunger. There
is no other way to account for the
presence of the remains in the cham
ber.

Dr. Sinclair Tells of Ex
plorationS in Prehistoric
Grave and Their Results
There were no distinct classes and the
chief's influence was only nominal.
The ceremonies of California were
characterized by a very slight-develop
ment of the extreme ritualism that was
so characteristic of the American In
dians and by an almost entire absence
of symbolism of any kind.
In conclusion. Dr. Kroeber says that
ethhologically California may be said
to be characterized by the absence of
agriculture and of pottery; by the total
absence of toteism or gentile organ
ization; by an- unusually simple and
loose social organization, la which
wealth plays a rather Important part;
by a rude development of the arts of
basketry; by a lack of realism; by &
slight development of fetishism; by the
marked prevalence of religious restric
tions connected with birth, death, mar
riage'and similar phases qf life; by the
predominance among ceremonials of
mourning rites, and by' a consid
erable development of true conceptions
of creation in mythology. -
Their social organization was simple
In the .extreme. Beyond the family
the bnl it bases of organization were the
village "and the language. In popula
tion and social life the village was ap
proximate to a localized clan,' but being
the largest unit it corresponded in a
measure to a .tribe. Little differences
were : observable: in the Indian society.
The habitations of the Indians could
bardly be dignified as houses, being
more of humble huts. They were
structures of brush and tule, and some
times bark and = wood. In arts they
were unusually primitive, basketry
alone being the only development of
skill. Pbttery was unknown, except
for a few rude attempts that were
made in imitation of the Shoshone-In
dians. ; They manufactured ropes and
strings, but no woven textiles. Dr.
Kroeber says:
-"Of t realistic representation either in
two or three dimensions there appears
to be virtually none beyond the pat
terns of baskets; and in these the con
ventional side in most cases far out
weighs the realistic, .the interpreta
tions of designs being pattern names,
and not symbolism. Picture printing is
foreign to the mind of the California
Indian." Â¦ -â¢Â¦ - -
social organization! v- ' .v
"Throughout the greater part of the
State the civilization of the Indians is
very much alike. While the number
of groups and divisions corresponding
to tribes and the number of languages
is large and no two groups "show ex
actly Identical customs and beliefs .the
general type of culture is uniform,
The exceptions are Southern California
and the northwestern part of the
State. But the territory covered by
these divergent cultures is compara
tive small, and more than two-thirds
of the State, Including all the central
part, show a fundamental ethnical
similarity^ whose distinguishing char
acteristics furthermore are not found
outside of the State. It is therefore
possible to speak of typical California
Indians and to recognize a typical Cal
if ornlan culture area." >
Their great stability of population
was one of the features of the Indian
residence in the State, and this, the
scientist says, goes to account for the
linguistic diversity existing among
them. Whenever extraneous races have
found their way into the State they
have ; always been completely assimi
lated to tHe condition of life of their,
neighbors.
Vegetable products seem to have
been the principal food products of the
aboriginal Californian. They were
hunters, too, and fishermen, but pre
ferred plant food. The staple every
where was acorns, although there was
an abundance of berries and' roots to
eat.
The observations of the scientist are
made in a bulletin written by him and
issued from the university to-day un
der the title, "Types of Indian Cul
ture in California." Only one attempt
has been made, he says, to give a sys
tematic account of the Indians of Cali
fornia and that by Stephen Powers
when he wrote his "Tribes of Califor
nia" twenty-five years ago. A more
extended search into the history of the
Indians has been made these last few
years by the University of California,
liberally assisted by Mrs. Hearst, with
the object of preserving all informa
tion obtainable about the Indians.
To Dr. Kroeber the California In
dians seem to have been given more to
the arts of peace than of warfare.
They were more primitive than the
Indians of any other part of the con
tinent and on the, whole not much
more above the plane of civilization
than the Eskimo. On this subject Dr.
Kroeber says:
"From the time of the first settle
ment of California its Indians have
been described as both more primi
tive and more peaceful than the ma
jority of the natives of North America,
On the whole this opinion is undoubt
edly, true. The practical arts of life,
the social institutions and the cere
monies of the California Indians are
unusually simple and undeveloped.
There were no war for its own sake,
no confederacies of powerful tribes,
no communal stone pueblos, no totems,
no potlatches. '; The plcturesquesness
and dlgpity of other Indians are lack
ing. In general" rudeness of "culture
the California Indiana are scarcely
above the Eskimo; and whereas the
lack of development of the Eskimo on
many sides of their nature is reasona
bly attributable in part to their diffi
cult and limiting environment, the
Indians of California inhabit a country
naturally as favorable, it would seem,
as might be. ' If the degree of civiliza
tion attained by people demands in
any large measure on their habitat,
as does not seem likely, it might be
concluded from the case of the Cali
fornia Indians that natural advantages
were . an impediment rather than an
incentive to progress.
GREAT UNIFORMITY.
In the Indian of Cal.i'ornla Dr. A.
L. Kroeber of the anthropological de
partment of the University of Califor
nia sees nothing of that dignity, pic
turesqueness and sanguinary spirit
that were among the chief character
istics of the other tribes of* aborigines
that roamed the American continent
before the white man began to press
westward. Dr. Kroeber finds that this
is something of an anomoly, as in all*
other instances of human occupation
the people have thrived and waxed
vigorous and powerful under such in
fluences of climate and environment
as prevail in California.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Mariposa, Captain Rennie, which
sailed yesterday for Tahiti, carried a
large number of passengers, all on
pleasure bound and many of them at
tracted to the South Seas by the pros
pect of seeing the natives of the
French possession celebrate the Fall
of the Bastile in their strictly South
Sea way. The festival has long been
an institution in Tahiti, but this is the
first time since the establishment of
the steamship line between here and
Papeete that a liner's visit will coin
cide with the celebration.
Tahiti is one of the few remaining
accessible Pacific Isles where the ro
tiance of the South Seas has been un
llsturbed by the hustle and bustle of
iommercialism. This trip on the
Mariposa is as nearly ideal as any
holiday excursion available from any
American port. Tourists seeking to
avoid the personally conducted ruts
of travel tako the trio and doctors all
over the country prescribe it for their
patients as the perfect rest cure. With
each succeeding trip the number of
passengers increases and as the vis
itors grow in number Papeete im
proves her hotel accommodations and
increases her about-the-island trans
portation facilities.
The Mariposa sailed yesterday to
the accompaniment of music played by
her own orchestra. On the tris down
and back there will be nightly hops on
board and while in Papeete "open
house" will be maintained on the
liner. The Mariposa will arrive at Pa
peete July 13, the day before the cele
bration, and will remain in port one
week. Natives from surrounding
islands will Join in the festivities, and
those travelers fortunate enough to
be of the liner's company will witness
a phase of South Sea life rarely seen
even by old travelers.
Among those who sailed on the
ilariposa were the following named:
Mrs. N. Rideout, Mrs. Robinson. Mr.
and Mrs. H. B. Sperry, Miss B. Sperry,
Mrs. Austin Sperry, Madame Helene
Louban and two children, Mr. and
Mrs. Vernier and child, Mrs. A. J. Har

Santa Barbara was chosen as the

of the convention before the award is
finally made. Paso Robles undertook
the task of entertaining the Christian

to handle the convention. To' obviate a
repetition of this the convention cities

entertaining the Endeavorers in 1905,
but owing to the failure of the Paso

short notice this year.

THE GRASS WIDOWS
AN IDEAL STUDY!.... A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE
The first subject selected could scarcely be recognized by the half-
tone above, on account of the impossibility of showing the exquisite col-
oring of the original by this process.
Copies of this picture, which is to be given away, are displayed in â¢
prominent places throughout the city. Don't fail to inspect one.
The Grass Widow represents a rare type of beauty, in that a peculiar #
piquancy is given to the expression of the face of this beautiful' woman by'
the wealth of Titian hair and her dark eyes. The richness of her auburn
tresses is heightened by the roses, carelessly draped in her coiffure, and
the pearls entwining her neck and bust; these with the contrasting back-
ground give warmth and brilliancy to the flesh tones.
In painting his subject Mr. Bryson makes liberal use of his well-
known talent in bringing out that life and dash so inseparable from the
American Girl. He portrays in this study an exquisitely gowned figure
seeking the buffet after a cotillon.
Combining artistic coloring and handling with a flavor of style and
smartness, these pictures, are the vogue throughout the country to-day.

As the publisher at best can only estimate the increased number that

FROM ALL SECTIONS THEY COME TO WIT-
NESS THE WONDERFUL DEMONSTRA-
TIONS OF THE NOTED LIVINGSTONE.
He is no imitator. His work Is upon original
lines: Pure â¢ thought, clear vision. He tails
you what you desire to know and works In the
open light.
He Is as conspicuous for his wonderful occult
analysis as he is .for his original expression
and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading is not a life reading; when
you call on Prof. Livingstone he will give you
a full life reading for $1; a test is of little
value; when the mind is troubled you need
more substantial aid and advice; this is just
what Prof. Livingstone gives you when you call
on him for a flrst-class clairvoyant reading.
He asks you no questions, but tells you what
you wish to know. Â¦
Would it not bÂ« a relief to know how you
will succeed, to be relieved of the matters
that are troubling you. and of the schemes of
your enemies, that you may meet with better
success?
He does not mention all the Ills and misfor-
tunes you are heir to; you are acquainted with
the facts in your case; let Prof. Livingstone
analyze the matters that are troubling you,
find the cause ot the trouble and suggest the
remedy.
Ills only reason for giving your name In full
or. any Important Information you may desire
is that he does this Incidentally as a chain to
read by. â¢

Springs, which bubble up out of the
white sand with great force, and about
three miles distant is another spring
of like character. If a chip were thrown
Into each of these and could float on
unlnterrputedly to the sea they would
reach their destination many thousands
of miles apart. One is the fountain
head of the Genesee River, which flows,
into Lake Ontario, and finally reaches
the sea at the mouth of the Gulf of St.
Lawrence. The other is the fountain
head of the Allegheny River, which
unites at Pittsburg with the Mononga
hela to form the Ohio, and -reaches the
sea at the* mouth of the Mississippi.
The third is the fountain head of Pine
Creek, which flows into the west branch
of the Susquehanna ana reaches the

Late Shipping Intelligence.
"Nobody was surprised," said my
friend. "We all know what life In such
places is like. A man can be happy in
Siberia on a lonely outpost where he
has no companion* of his own rank
within 100 miles, but there Is no hap
piness possible in a small Russian gar
rison town for a man of average In
telligence."âWorld's Work.
This passion for seir-sacrifica Is the.
keynote of the Russian character and
is cultivated in the army by every pos
sible means. The recruit Is Invariably
told the story of that heroic company
of infantrymen In the Lomakin expedi
tion into Turkestan who, at a critical
moment, threw themselves Into a deep
ditch in order that the guns which
were sorely needed at the front might
be galloped over their bodies. It is
doubtful whether this could have hap
pened in any army but the Russian.
If there is one thing in which thÂ»
Russian army excels it Is marching.
Lord Roberta' famous march to Can
dahar has been equaled over and over
again by the Czar's troops Jn their Cen
tral Asia campaigns. When General
Kuropatkin marched a force of Turk
estan troops to join Skobeleff in the at
tack on Geok Tepe he and his men
were swallowed up in an unknown,
trackless desert for twenty-six days.
yet they covered over forty miles a day
and marched in at the end of the time
in perfect military order without a
single man sick or fallen out. It was
a "wonderful feat, but It was not re
garded in Russian military circles as
being anything extraordinary.
A former captain of the Russian
army told me of a friend of his who
lived for years In a small town and
was then ordered away to St. Peters
burg. In less than six months he re
ceived a command to return and
promptly blew his brains out.
There Is a monument In Turkestan
to several Russian soldiers captured
by Turcomans In 1379. They were, ar
tillerymen, and their euna were cap
tured with them; so the Turcomans
naturally ordered them, on penalty of
death, to serve those guns against their
own comrades. Every man refuse dÂ»
choosing death by horrible torture and
dying without a murmur.
Incidents From History That Show

GREAT SELF-SACRIFICE
OF RUSSIAN SO_DDSR3
In a case at Doncaster in 1836 the
purchaser, instead of paying cash,
agreed to take over the vendor's four
children with the wife. This was the
document which figured later in the
police court: "New Colnisboro, March
8, 1896.â I, Enoch Childs, is quite will
ing to take your wife and children as
mine, that is your wife, Ellen Tart,
and Sarah, John, Henry and Eliza!
Signed, Ellen Tart, Enoch Childs."
Though Lancashire is so* kin to York
shire no sales of wives are known In
the County Palatine. But in Alfreton.
in Derbyshire, a collier sold his wife
for fourpence in 1882. In 1873 there was
a remarkable case at Belper; the wife
of an absconding debtor had a halter
placed about her neck and was led Into
the market place on Saturday after
noon and offered for sale by auction
as one of her husband's assets. But
there were no bidders and no sale.
About four years ago Irthlngborough,
near Northampton, supplied a southern
instance. . A shoemaker paraded the
streets with a bell calling upon all per
sons to know that he had that after
noon "sold and bequeathed" his wife
to' John â â . He proclaimed the names
of two companions as witnesses to thÂ«
transaction. The purchase money was
two shillings. Baring Gould cites sim
ilar sales in the -West country, and to
go back more than thirty years would
mean the extension of this subject to
Intolerable length, for a century ago
wife. selling was almost common.
That it is practiced as frequently as
it Is will; come as a surprise . to most
readers. In addition to these northern
instances many a wife is sold to-day in
the east end of London, but of all such
cases over the country only a few are
revealed to public knowledge â London
Globe, * â¢
TAKES CHILDREN, TOO.
, These are merely two recent cases
which have come to light The ma
jority of such sales of wives never
attain publicity. At Leeds Assizes in
1895 Benjamin Gibbons was tried for
bigamy. He admitted that he had
married a woman while his first wife
was alive, but he pleaded that as he
had sold her he was entitled to marry
again. She was a young woman
and unruly; even though he con
stantly gave her good hidings, she
troubled him, and, tiring of her, he
sold her to a soldier for 3s 6d. She
went quite willingly and married her
purchaser.
Again, at Leeds Assizes three years
ago, another bigamist offered the same
defense. In his arrest he stated:
"When I married her I knew I had
a wife living, but I sold her for 60s."
More recently at Stockport an elderly
man told the magistrates that he
thought he ;was entitled to marry
again as he had sold his first wife to a
chimney sweep for 18 pence.
In each case it will be noted that the
purchase money is small. This is not
due to a low valuation of the woman,
but a nominal sum is agreed upon to
make the bargain an actual one. The
legal doctrine of "value received" is so
far understood by the vulgar mind.
The sale, indeed, is the poor man's di
vorce. His honesty in this matter is
shown by his retention of the children
of the marriage, and his maintenance
of them.
Legends of Sheffield grinders who In
drunken bouts sell their wives for a
quart of ale are well known. But now
adays such transactions are no longer
conducted offhand. They are invested
with formality, as witness this docu
ment which flirured in a case at the
Sheffield County Court in 1887: "At the
Royal Oak, Sheffield, I, Abraham
Boothroyd, agree to sell my wife Clara
to William Hall for the sum of 5 shil
lings."
In another case the bargaining was
accidentally overheard In a publlo
house by a Sheffield journalist. A
collier's wife had transferred her af
fections to another man. and the hus
band was willing to renounce his
claim for suitable compensation. So
the parties assembled in a public
house to arrange matters. There was
the husband with a friend, his wife
with her father and mother and the
prospective purchaser with a friend.
The husband demanded Â£3 for his
wife; she herself said it was too much,
and her new man . said he wouldn't
give more than a sovereign. Finally
30s was the sum agreed upon. It was
paid over and the document drawn up,
signed and witnessed: "Mr. Taylor to
have my wife, Elizabeth Smith, free
from me forever, to do as she has a
mind, this day, December 11, 1893.
"YOUNG AND UNRULY."
SELLS FOR FIVE SHILLINGS.
Readers of Mr. Hardy's novels have
been reminded of the opening chapters
of "The Mayor of Casterbridge" by the
case at Marlborough-street Police
Court the other day, where It was
shown that the defendant had got rid
of his wife by selling her for a copple
of shillings. For precedents for this
commercial ' form of divorce. some Jour
nalists have searched the records of a
century ago and produced numerous
Instances of wives being led to the cat
tle market and there knocked down to
the highest bidder.
But it is not necessary to go back
anything like 100 years for such sales
of wives. There are sufficient modern
instances to maintain the assertion
that wife selling is still a British cus
tom. There are hundreds of people
who still believe that to transfer a wife
to another man for a cash payment is
a legal transaction and a valid disso
lution of matrimonial ties. As a popu
lar error it ranks with the idea that
if husband or wife be absent 'and un
heard of for seven years. the other is
free to marry again. In Yorkshire
generally and in Sheffield in particular,
this doctrine of wife selling is still so
firmly established and frequently prac
ticed that it has little less than the
force of a local law.
What reason Stanley had for main
taining: the mystery as to his origin,
as to his estrangement with his father
and as to hl3 early career, it is im
possible to say. For he was not In the
habit of taking even his best friends
into his confidence about such mat
ters. But it is quite evident that In
spite of all Stanley's well-earned fame
and celebrity, the dean and chapter
of England's national Walhalla known
aa Westminster Abbey, had some rea
son for hestitatlng about according a
tomb and a monument there to a man
who for some mysterious reason was
unwilling to shed any light upon his
origin, to enlighten the world as to his
parentage and date of birth, or even
to admit where his boyhood had been
spent.â Baltimore American. '. ;
Now, unless there were two Henry
Morton Stanleys who enlisted on the
same day at New Orleans, were taken
prisoners together, again escaped to
gether from Pittsburg and subsequent
ly re-enlisted on the same day In the
Federal army at New York, It is evi
dent that the bookbinder's son, Howell
Jones, and the famous explorer, who
died as "Sir Henry Morton Stanley, were
one and the same person.
MYSTERIOUS RETICENCE.
The name of Henry Morton Stanley
he took, not from any New Orleans
merchant, but from an aunt for whom
he had a particular affection and who
had been especially kind to him. It
may be added that no amount of in
vestigation, nor even reward offered
by some curious persons, ever brought
any information as to the New Or
leans merchant from whom the ex
plorer was said to have taken the
name of "Stanley." Directories Ig
nored his existence and no New Or
leans resident had ever heard of him.
Old Joshua Jones, the bookbinder,
was still alive when Stanley returned
from finding Livingstone in Africa,
but was too Infirm to travel to London.
Moreover, there was some estrange
ment between father and son. But the
former had no difficulty in recognizing
his boy in the pictures of Stanley.
It may be stated further that Thomas
George In his book proves by doc
uments, which are incontrovertible,
that the son of the bookbinder, under
the name of Stanley, enlisted as an
"able seaman" in the Confederate navy
at the time of the Civil War, which
implied previous seafaring experience,
and the fact that he was a grown
man instead of a mere boy, and that
this same Henry Morton Stanley was
taken prisoner, confined at Pittsburg,
whence he made his escape, and sub
sequently after his other visits to
Wales, above mentioned, returned to
America and enlisted In the Federal
army.
ORIGIN OF HIS NAME.
A curious reason has been put for
ward by the authorities of West
minster Abbey for denying to the re
mains of the late Sir Henry M. Stan
ley that entombment In Westminster
Abbey for which he had craved, wish
ing to be buried near Dr. Livingstone,
whose name and fame were to such a
degree identified with his own. It
seems that the real reason was that no
one knew exactly what the real name
of Stanley was, and the famous ex
plorer never took any trouble to dear
up the mystery or to vouchsafe any
explanation, not even when Thomas
George, a boyhood companion and
playmate of Stanley, published his
book in 1895, through the Roxburghe
Press, entitled "The Birth, Boyhood
and Younger Days of Henry M. Stan
ley," wherein there was a clear state
ment, supported by a wealth of detail
and anecdote, showing that Stanley
was not, \as generally believed, a
foundling ot the name of John Row
lands, brought up in the workhouse
of St. Asaph. In Wales, and the adopt
ed son of a merchant at New Orleans,
who had been his benefactor and who
had given him his name, but was In
reality Howell Jones, son of Joshua
Jones, a Carmarthenshire bookbinder,
and who ran away to sea. writing to
his parents from France, from Peru
and from America. He returned home
during the Civil War in this country,
spent a fortnight with his parents,
during which time he saw the author
of the book â namely: Thomas George,
and then returned to America.

called for Mr. Blank on acount of the
crowds, all of which is moet undigni
fied. But the greatest evil la the an
noyance given to members of com
mittees whose rooms are on the'corri
dors of the House by reason of the
noise and loud talking. Members of
the committee on appointments are
loud in their complaints and declare
that deliberations are often inter
rupted because of this anonyance.
Following the suggestion Mr. Wood,
superintendent of the Capitol, has had
an oak library table, fitted out with
writing materials and cards, six leath
er seated library chairs, four wicker
reception chairs and two wicker so
fas placed in the east lobby. A page
Is In charge and his duty is to furnish
the cards, take them to the doorkeep
er and have general charge of the
room. If the experiment proves suc
cessful, and there is no doubt that It
will, Mr. Wood will have the room
furnished in a style in keeping with
its purpose and befitting the dignity of
the House.
ANNOYANCES TO IMEMBERS.
This was never popular either wltM
callers or with members themselves.
In the first place, it waa too public and
it was too far from the House* and
the long corridor which had to be trav
ersed by members In response to cards
from visitors afforded persons whom
they wished to avoid an opportunity
to pounce down upon them. Here, as
in the east lobby, the privilege waa
abused, and early In Speaker Hender
son's administration carpets, chairs and
sofas were whisked away as If by
magic, and the House was without a
reception-room.
The result has been unsatisfactory
both to callers and members. Ladles
who send their cards In to members
are compelled to stand around the
doors and in the corridors the tafget
of all eyes and surrounded by cro-wds
of men.
IN STATUARY HALL.
This privilege was finally abused:
obnoxious characters made It a louns
ing place until It became so offensive
that Speaker Reed had thÂ« furniture
removed to statuary hall, and here the
marble-room of the House was arala
established.
The domestic arrangements of the
Capitol have been g|vcna new turn by
order of Speaker Cannon, and another
chapter has been added to the vicissi
tudes through -which the reception
room of the House of Representatives
has passed. Again, as in the daya of
the Forty-sixth. "Forty-seventh. Forty
eighth. Forty-ninth and Fiftieth Con
gresses, the House will have a recep
tion-room which will be worthy the
designation If the experiment which Is
now on proves satisfactory.
This has been established In the east
lobby of the House. It was here In thÂ«
palmy days of the woman lobbyist tSaf
the first reception-room was estab
lished, and from here ladles who wished
to see members of the House sent their
cards. .

Washington Crop Bulletin.
The report of G. N. Salisbury, section dl
rertor. T'r.iterJ State* Weaiher Bureau, for the
TVa?h!rrton Crop Bulletin, wrck ended June
2 s . is as? follows :
"The week was cool, except the last two
days, which were moderately warm. It was
generally dry. ercrpt light local showers oc
curred In the northwest portion on the 21st
e.r.1 2Cd. On the 22d and 2:!d frosts occurred,
wh'.ch were heavy in localities of the western
division, and severe In portions of the eastern
counties. Such vegetables as tomatoes, beans
and ex-en potatoes were cut down and fruit,
cora and rmall frraJn were injured. The ex
teat to which wheat was damaged is not
accurately known.
"The cool weather was favorable for tha
Clllnx cf winter wheat, except where It may
have been touched by frost, and it Is generally
Jr. very promising condition. Sprinjr wheat
Is reported as in pood condition In mort parts
of Whitman County but in many other local
ities rain Is needed for the success of the
crop. In forr.e localities only one-half of a
crop is anticipated. The wheat crop Is very
weedy. Nothing adverse is reported In regard
to oats. Corn has not b?en making progress
and hops need warmer weather. Potatoes are
in general bloom. Many anticipate a light
crop, although It Is early to form a con
clusion.
"Haying has been general throughout the
week, with almost ideal wcath'r for the pur
pose. The dry weather during May and June
has contributed to make a crop that Is con
sidered only light to fair, although secured,
fo far in splendid condition. In the moist
soutbwert cooatlea the crop appears to be
heavier." * I â¢

The general tone of the Poultry market was
one of weakness, although receipts were light
and offerings less liberal. Western stock was
cleaned up. but there wore quite a few coops
of Callfornian still unsold at the close. Four
cars of Western, chlrfly Hens, were marketed
during the week, and the daily receipts from
domestic points were unusually heavy. As
previously mentioned, only young Roosters
were firm, dealers being willing to make con
cessions on all other descriptions. A car of
Western falls due to-morrow, but unless mar
ket conditions are favorable it will not be
marketed until Tuesday.

The market for miscellaneous vegetables was
active, as usual on Saturday, but prices gen
erally had a downward tendency under heavy
receipts. Green Peas were the only scarce
article on the list and were quoted higher.
Small boxes of Cucumbers and Summer Squash
were practically unsalable and large boxes of
the latter were quoted lower. Tomatoes,
Green Peppers and Egg Plant were In in
creased supply and easier. Green Okra was
offering in small quantities and met with ready
sale at 20c per pound.
An' easy feeling prevailed In the Potato mar
ket and the weakness In new crop stock was
even more pronounced than on the preceding
day, as receipts from tho river districts con
tinued heavy. There was very little doing in the
shipping line and local buyers were operating
cautiously, as Monday will be a holiday and
increased supplier, with consequent lower
prices, are expected with the resumption of
business on Tuesday. One small lot of selected
whites that was keenly competed for by rival
Jobbers sold at $2 Â«5 per cental, but for the
general market $2 per cental was an extreme
figure. Onions, like Potatoes, ruled weak, but
prices were not quotably lower.

At Mannheim on the Rhine the
American importers have their rag
picking houses, where the rags are col
lected from all over Europe, the dis
ease-infected Levant not excepted, and
where women and children, too poor
to earn a better living; work day after
day, with wet sponges tied over their
mouths, sorting these /ilthy scraps for
shipment to New York. Our best papers
are made of these rags and our common
ones of wood pulp, which is obtained
by grinding and macerating huge
blocks from some of our soft-wooded
forest trees. â New York Commercial.
It is not a pleasant thought that the
brilliant white note paper that your
hand rests on may have in It fibers
from the filthy garment of some Egypt
ian fellah after it has passed through
all the stages of decay until It is saved
by a ragpicker from the gutter of an
Egyptian town; and yet it is a fact
that hundreds of tons of Egyptian rags
are exported every year into America
to supply our paper mills.

But the matter will now have to be
taken up with the State Department,
for it has become public property, that
the sacred soil of Japan was invaded
without authority or warrant , by an
officer employed by the United States.
The fact that the officer was only a
poor, misguided bicycle .policeman does
not seem to ameliorate the sensitive
situation.â New York Tribune.
The colored porter or the legation,
a bicycle policeman and the speed laws
of the district figured prominently in
the first chapter of this harrowing tale.
The porter, a long limbed, vigorous
young uegro, "was pedaling too rapidly
along Massachusetts avenue about a
week ago. A bicycle policeman swung
around .the corner of Fourteenth street,
saw the vision of ebony flashing down
the avenue ahead of him and gave
chase, after emitting two or three loud
cries of "Stop!" The porter looked
around, measured the distance, con
cluded that .he could outpedal the po
liceman and "humped himself." The
chase led down Massachusetts avenue
to Sixteenth street, north on Sixteenth
to N street, and back east on N street
to No. 1310, where the Mikado's little
inviolable extraterritorial plat is sit
uated. By the time the porter reached
the legation the policeman was close
behind him. Off his wheel leaped the
porter, and in lees time than it takes
to tell about it he had dragged the
bicycle across the sidewalk to the fence,
lifted it over and leaped after it. The
policeman gained on him in this ma
neuver, and just as the porter reached
the top of the stairway leading to the
basement the officer's hand was on his
collar. The porter thereupon dropped
his wheel in the path of the policeman
and went down the steps.
The policeman fell over the wheel
and bumped down the stairs and pick
ed himself up as the porter vanished
through the door. The pursued did
not have time to Hose the door after
him, and, without pausing to think of
the awful crime he was committing,
the policeman dashed in. He caught
sight of the porter climbing the stairs
to the first floor and, still unheedful of
his international trespass, dashed after
him. Somewhere in the Oriental dra
peries of the first floor the porter
eluded his pursuer and tne policeman,
mad clear through from his bumps,
began a systematic search of the prem
ises. How long he looKed he did not
know, but suddenly a commanding
voice brought him to a halt. He found
himself surrounded by stern faced
Japanese, who looked him through and
through.
"What are you doing here?" the po
liceman heard one of them ask him
in excellent English.
"I am looking for the fellow that I
chased in here," stammered the police
man, beginning to feel uncomfortable.
"Do you know where you are?" the
commanding voice inquired.
"No, and I don't care," retorted the
policeman, angrily. "I want to arrest
that colored fellow."
"This is the Japanese legation and
you are a trespasser. It may go hard
with you for breaking the law of na
tions."
The policeman tried to explain his
position, but the officials would listen
to no excuses. Chancellor Stevens was
called in and after a conference man
aged to appease their wrath sufficiently
to allow the matter to be dropped for
the present, "if no publication was
| made of the occurrence." If the affair
j became public it was insisted, how
| ever, it would have to be taken up
I diplomatically and the least that could
then be done would be the discharge
of the policeman and an apology from
the United States.
The chancellor of the Japanese lega
tion at Washington is in great distress
over the publication of an incident that
took place at Minister Takahira's resi
dence a few days ago. The occurrence
itself did not amount to much, but It
may, nevertheless, result in an "inter
national affair." In order to prevent it
from assuming such tremendous pro
portions Chancellor Stevens strained
every nerve to bottle up the news and
thought for a time that he had suc
ceeded.

national Inquiry.

The Civil Service Commission has
furnished to the House Committee on
Civil Service Reform a statement
showing that the total number of ex
soldiers and ex-sallors of the Civil War
employed In the" executive department
at Washington is 2176 and the widows
of veterans so employed 383. The in
formation was asked in view of com
plaints that there are many superan
nuated clerks on the pay rolls.
The largest number of veterans â 641 â
is employed in the Interior Depart
ment, while the Treasury Department
carries 553 and the War Department
347. There are only twenty-three vet
erans on the Navy Department roll and
only seven In the State Department.
The ages of the old soldiers and sail
ors vary from 50 to 82 years. There are
217 who are 61 years old, while those
younger form the next larger class, 197
in number. Nearly two-thirds, or 13S3,
are from 58 to 65 years of age. Those
over 70 years of age number 226, and of
this number eleven are over 80.
The veteran with the longest service
'is 77 years old. He has served flfty-two
years. Nearly two-thirds, or 1332 of the
2175 veterans, receive salaries ranging
from $1200 to $2500 per annum, while
sixty-six receive more than $2300 per
annum. Those receiving $340 or less
number 476. The veterans and their
widows constitute 10 per cent of the
number of persons employed in the de
partments and Government Printing
Office in Washington.â Chicago Chron

EXEMPT FIREMEN WILL
CELEBRATE AT THE "PLAZA"
Spot Where American Flag First
Waved â Red Men to Keep tho
Fourth at Glen Park. V ;
The members of the Exempt Fire
Company have decided to celebrate
the 128th anniversary of the declara
tion of independence, at the home of
the association In "the old engine
house on the hill" at the head of
Portsmouth Square, or the plaza, as it
was called in the early days. This is
the historic spot where on July 9,
1846, the stars and stripes were first
hoisted on the soil of Northern Call-
fornia. r
The Improved Qrder of Red Men
will have a jollification and picnic in
Glen Park to-morrow in honor of the
Fourth. There will be a number of
games and races in addition to the
usual attractions at the park. The
order is a patriotic as well as a bene
ficial and charitable one, and the an
niversary of the signing of the decla
ration of independence is one that is,
always patriotically observed.

The out-of-the-rut nature of the
fourth excursion of the California Pro
motion Committee to Eureka 13 prov
ing a drawing card to many who wish
to see the heart of the great redwood
country and enjoy the stage ride
through Humboldt County. The party
will go almost a hundred miles by
stage, camping out two days on the
way through one of the most Interest
ing scenic regions in the West. The
stage ride from Sh*rwood to Camp
Five is planned so that no one will be
fatigued. Each day two hours will be
given for luncheon en route. There
are so many unusual features con
nected with this trip from bay to sea
by rail, stage and return by boat that
the California Promotion Committee
will have a representative party from
San Francisco and vicinity.
A pleasant feature of the journey will
be the public receptions planned by the
citizens in the cities along the way as
well as in Eureka, where the Humboldt
County Chamber of Commerce is pre
paring to entertain the visitors, this
being the first time a representative
delegation of business men have ever
visited the city of Eureka on such a
mission. President Soule of the Hum
boldt County Chamber of Commerce
has planned so that every moment of
the visitors* time will be engaged.
It will be rather Bohemian in spots,
as the party will camp overnight in
the shade of the redwoods.
Following are suggestions to the
members of the party. Issued by the
promotion committee in order that all
may be fully prepared:
It is suggested that, khaki suits be
worn, as being especially- appropriate
for the journey by stage. It is desir
able that no luggage be taken on the
stage. Only toilet articles and towels
will be required for the first four days
of the trip. Suit cases containing
changes of clothing will be carried free
of charge to Eureka by the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company. Cases
should be tagged with full name and
address, care of Vance Hotel, Eureka,
and delivered care of C. W. Miller,
pier No. 9, Broadway wharf, Pacific
Coast Steamship Company's steamer
Pomona, not later than 7a.rn.on Sat
urday, July_9. Luggage so delivered
will be found in room at Vance Hotel
on arrival at Eureka. Blankets (two
for each man) pillows and cots will be
furnished by the committee and com
modious conical tents will provide com
fortable sleeping quarters. Take along
yeur^own cigars. Those who care to
fish will find frequent opportunity.
Fishing tackle should be taken. Bring
your own tin cup, knife, fork and
spoon.
The limit cf the party Is almost
reached and it is hoped that all who
desire to accompany this excursion will
make application as early as possible
in order that proper accommodations
may be arranged. Of course in the
district to be traversed there is no
telephonic or telegraphic communica
tion and it is necessary to arrange de
tails by mail, taking some two or three
days. The California Promotion Com
mittee, at 25 New Montgomery street,
will be glad to give all details regard
ing this six-day excursion for $45,
which Includes hotel and traveling ex
penses. \
ACCUSED OF EMBEZZLEMENT.â
Henry W. Knighton was arrested yes
terday by Detectives E. Gibson and Sil
vey on a warrant from Police Judge
Conlan's court charging him with mis
demeanor embezzlement. The complain
ing witness Is C. P. Baughman. 509
Market street, who alleges that Knight
on' embezzled $7 85 on June 30. Knighton
was employed as his bookkeeper BFS
The authorities say that successful
measures to decrease the ravages of
the pests are being adopted, but they
are hopeless of extirpating the plague
so long as the present unsuitable build
ings are occupied. No sure cure can bo
effected until new and substantial hos*
pital buildings are provided.
An army of rats la one of the woes of
life at the City and County Hospital.
Patients at that institutionâhun
dreds of themâ complain that, in addi
tion to the afflictiona resulting from
personal infirmities, they are compelled
to endure unspeakable terrors from
these rodents. The animals swarm
over the place Â»ln great numbers and
boldness, and the sick people are com
pelled to be constantly on guard to es
capa being eaten up alive. Not a night
passes that some patient Is not awak
ened and -kept In terror by rodents
passing over his body in search of food.
In many cases inmates have been at
tacked and bitten on the hands or face
or other parts of their bodies which
happened to be exposed.
In ward B one night last week half
a dozen helpless patients were badly
bitten. In that ward ninety-eight mon
strous rats were killed during the last
ten days, and the pest Is said to bo
Just as great In most of the other divi
sions of the hospital. Several wards
have guards to watch against thÂ© sav
agery of the rodents, which seem to
understand the helplessness of their
victims. Bitter complaints are made
by the patients and every precaution is
taken to relieve them, but the old
buildings are badly constructed and
they offer secret and comfortable
homes for vast numbers of the fierce
vermin.
So Intelligent have the rats becomo
that poison, no matter how seductively
disguised, is rejected and traps are of
little use.
Rumors that have been gaining in
strength ever since Father Parrish sud
denly relinquished the rectorship of
the ritualistic Church of the Advent,
to the effect that the brilliant young
clergyman had determined to abandon
the faith of his fathers and join the
Roman Catholic church, are pro
nounced by Father Lathrop, an asso
ciate priest of the church to be utterly
without foundation.
The explanation of Father Parrlsh's
withdrawal from active parish work
Is found in a determination formed
years ago to become a general mission
ary among the churches, following the
example of Archdeacon Webber and
Father Huntlngton, whose success in
their particular field has been so great
and lasting. That a permanent center,
or monastery, is to be established, is
doubted, at least for the present.
Father Parrish will journey all over
the country, holding missions and
strengthening the faith of his church
men wherever found. The life is a
self-denying one and full of hardships,
but Father Parrish Is convinced that
It Is his special vocation. He is now
resting at Loa Gatos In a beautiful
country home he has lately purchased.
In September he will start out ' as a
preaching missionary. He is a preacher
of high rank in his own church and an
authority In Biblical scholarship.
This morning at the.Emanuel Evan
gelical Church, Twelfth street, be
tween Market and Mission, the Rev. F.
W. Fischer will preach on "True Lib
erty." In the evening the subject of
his discourse will be "The Republic
of God."
Rev. E. Xelander, pastor of the
First English Lutheran Church, Geary
street near Gough, will have for his
text this morning "Light on Perplex
ing Questions," and in the evening,
"The Greater Tabernacle."
At Grace Episcopal Church, Califor
nia and Stockton streets, Bishop Part
ridge of Kyoto, Japan, who is on a
visit to San Francisco, will occupy
the pulpit at the morning service.
The colored jubilee singers from
Claflin University will sing this morn
ing at the Trinity Methodist Church,
Market, Xoe and Sixteenth streets. In
the afternoon they will sing at the
men's meeting in the auditorium of
the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion. To-night President L. M. Dun
ton of this university will occupy the
pulpit of the First Presbyterian
Church, Van Ness avenue and Sacra
mento street.
Several churches in the city will
have interesting and special features
to-day in connection with their ser
vices.

The members of the party are told
In the call that they must do their
rustling, for delegates to the conven
tions on Tuesday, August 9, and com
ply with law made and provided.
The call Is issued upon the following
basis:.
The apportionment of delegates to
said State convention shall be: One
delegate, for each 200 votes cast for
Franklin K. Lane, Democratic ': nomi
nee for Governor, in Assembly District
or county, where more than one
county. ' Is embraced in an Assembly
"Tim" Spellacy has formally called
the Democrats into State convention at
Santa Cruz on August 22. Tim has
the right to do that, as he was elected
chairman of the Democratic State
Central Committee on June 18. Be
sides, he was told by the Gavin Mc-
Nab contingent to do so. Following
instructions he informs the members
of the party that there will be 723 of
them under one roof while the "sad
sea waves" pound along the beach at
Santa Cruz and the delegates pound
each other, if they have an old-fash
ioned convention. District delegations
are also to assemble at the same time
and name tickets.
DEMOCRATIC CALL.
The Labor party is still having trou
ble. The two factions have not come
together as yet, but there Is a likeli
hood that they will some time this*
week. One faction, led by Tom Eagan,
will meet in.Shlels Hall Tuesday night,
and the other side will assemble the
following night in Foresters' Hall and
pass upon the question of getting the
labor unions to participate in the cam
paign as organized bodies. According
to the two bodies, one of which has been
recognized by the courts as the proper
one, the getting of the unions into
line Is the all-important matter. When
the Harders-Berger faction met last
week the question arose as to whether
letters should be sent to the different
unions requesting aid for the ticket. It
was concluded best not to make such a
request, as it was possible that the op
position would take advantage of such
an -opportunity to pack the meeting.
Tuesday night the others will decide
what is good for them and act accord
ingly. Official calls have been issued.
Precincts will have registration for
voters next Wednesday and Thursday,
but after that all voters who wish to
cast their ballots at the primary elec
tion, August 9, must register at the
City Hall prior to July 20. Any elector
who wishes to pass up his privilege of
voting for delegates to conventions, but
who desires to vote for the nominees in
November, will have until September 28
to register at the City Hall. Precinct
registration places will be open from
10 o'clock in the morning until 9 o'clock
at night. Those who do not register
for the primary election in August will
be able to register in their precincts
September 14 and 13. Such registra
tions will only entitle the. electors to
vote at the general election In Novem
ber.
All of the old registration books have
been destroyed. Any elector who voted
at the last election two years ago will
have to register again in order to as
sure his right of franchise. This condi
tion is not generally understood, but it
is the law. Every precinct in the city
has one or more placards displayed
setting forth that fact, but there may
be some of the electors who will over
lock the Importance of the law and fail
to register.
LABOR PARTY TROUBLES.
CHANCES TO REGISTER.
Music will lend Its charm to the oc
casion. Short, spicy speeches will tell
of the history of the party, of its lead
ers and of its future. There will be
plenty of entertainment, for the best
speakers in the State will attend. The
Alhambra Theater will be used for the
celebration and the decorations
adopted for the Fourth of July cere
mony will be replenished and the in
terior of the auditorium made as at
tractive as art can make it.
Another joint meeting of the sutA
committee from the Republican State
Central Comlttee and a like repre
sentation from the United Republican
Leagues of California was held in the
Palace Hotel yesterday morning, when
additional arrangements were made to
make the celebration of the night of
July 6 a historic demonstration.
The joint committee arranged to have
the De Koven Quartet of Oakland fur
nish the vocal music. A band of
twelve pieces will supply the instru
mental attractions and enliven the
evening's pleasure.
Seats are to be reserved for ladles,
many of whom are expected to attend.
Many Republicans from this city and
other parts of the State will have seats
on the platform as vice presidents.
The principal speakers who will ad
dress the meeting have been selected
as follows: Samuel M. Shortrldge,
Judge Henry C. Dibble, Carey Van
Fleet, Julius Kahn, Senator Perkins,
John T. Dare and that Republican who
took the Chicago convention by
storm â George A. Knight.
The joint committee will meet again
on Tuesday to complete the final ar
rangements and also announce the list
of vice presidents of the gathering.
The enthusiasm which is expected to
thrill the patriotic Americans to-mor
row, when the day of national inde
pendence will be celebrated, will be
much-more abundant than usual' if it
equals that which will be displayed
Wednesday night Plans are , being
perfected for the greatest political
celebration ever observed in San Fran
cisco. The occasionMs the birthday
anniversary of the Republican party
and an unqualified Indorsement will be
