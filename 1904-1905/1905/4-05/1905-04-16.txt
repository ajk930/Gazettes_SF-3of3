it is with diffidence that I allude to

Turned about six o'clock on a cold,
v intf-r's- evening. As rfolmes
turned up the lamp the light fell upon
a card on the table. He glanced at it,
hen, with an ejaculation of dis
gust, threw it on the floor. I picked it
up and read:
CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON,
APPLEDORE TOWERS.
AGENT. HAMPSTEAD.
Who is he?" I asked.
"The â worst man in London." Holmes
answered, as he sat down and stretch
ed his legs before the fire, "Is any
thing on the back of the card?"
I turned it c
"Will call at 6:2Oâ C. A. M.," I read.
"Hum! He's about due. Do you feel
a creeping, shrinking sensation, Wat
son, when you stand before the ser
pents in the Zoo, and see the slithery,
cr, venomous creatures, with their
deadly eyes and wicked, flattened
faces'? Well, thats how Milverton im
presses me. I've had to do with fifty
murderers in my career, but the worst
of them never gave me the repulsion
which I have for this fellow. And yet I
can't get out of doing business with
him â indeed, he is here at my invita

"But who is he?"
"I'll tell you, Watson. He is the king
of all the blackmailers. Heaven help

I had seldom heard my friend speak
with such intensity of feeling.
"But surely," said I, "the fellow must
be within the grasp of the law?"
"Technically, no doubt, but practi
cally not. "What would it profit a
woman, for example, to get him a few
months" imprisonment, if her own ruin
must immediately follow? His victims
dare not hit back. If ever he black
mailed an innocent person, then in
deed we shquld have him, but he is as
tunning as the Evil One. No, no, wa
must find other ways to fight him."
"And why is he here?"
"Because an illustrious client has
placed her piteous case in my hands.
It is the Lady Eva Blackwell, the most
beautiful debutante of last season, tfhi:
la to be married in a fortnight to the
Karl of Dovercourt. This fiend rms
several imprudent letters â imprudent,
Watson, nothing worse â which were
written to an Impecunious young squire
in the country. They would suffice to
break c-fT the match. Milverton will
send the letters to the Earl unless a
large sum of money is paid him. I have
been commissioned to meetiiim, andâ
to make the best terms I can.'
At that instant there was a clatter
and a rattle in the street below. Look
ing down I caw a stately carriage and
pair, the brilliant lamps gleaming on
the glossy * haunches of the nobl^
chestnuts. A footman opened the door
and a small, stout man in a shaggy
astrakhan overcoat descended. A min
ute later he was in th? room.
Charles Augustus Milvertun was a
man of fifty, with a large, intellectual
head, a round, plump, hairless face, a
perpetual, frozen smile, and two keen
gray eyes, which gleamed brightly
from behind broad, gold-rimmed
glasses. There was something of Mr.
Pickwick's benevolence in his appear
ance, marred only by the insincerity of
the fixed smile and by the hard glitter
of those restless and penetrating eyes.
His voice was as smooth and suave as
his countenance, aa he advanced with
a plump little hand extended, murmur
ing his regret for having missed us at
his first visit. Holmes disregarded the
outstretched hand and looked at him
with a face of granite. Milverton's
smile broadened, he shrugged his
6hou:derÂ», removed his overcoat, folded
it v.ith great deMbr-ration over the
back of a chair and then took a seat.
"This gentleman?" said he, with a
wave in mv direction. "Is it discreet?
-Is it right. '
"Dr. Wateon is my friend and part
ner."
"Very good. Mr- Holmes. It is only
in your client's interests that I pro
tested. The matter is so very deli
cateâ"
"Dr. Watson has already heard of
-
"Thco"we can proceed to business.
You sa;'that you are acting for Lady
Eva. Has she empowered you to ac
cept my terius?"
Yhat are your terms?"
"Geven thousand pounds."
â¢ And the alternative?"
"My doar sir. It is painful for me to
discuss It, but if 'the money is not paid
on the 14th there certainly will be no
marriage on the lSth." His insuffer
able smile was more complacent than
ever.
Holmes thought for a little.
"You appear to me." he said at last,
"to be taking matters too much for
granted. I am. of course, familiar with
the coniems of these letters. My client
will certainly do what I may advise.
I fcha!! counsel her to tell her future
husband the whole story and to trust
to his generosity."
Milverton chuckled.
' You evidently do not know the
Ear!, ' said he.
From the baffled look upon Holmes'
face I could see clearly that he did.
"What harm Is there in the letters?"
he ask,ed.
'"They are sprightly â very sprightly,"
Milverton answered. "The lady was a
charming correspondent. But I can as
sure you that the Earl of Dovercourt
would fail to appreciate them. How
ever, since you think otherwise, we will
let it rest at that. It is purely. a mat
ter of business. Tf you think that it
is in the best interests of your client
that these letters should be placed In
the hands of the Earl, then you would
indeed be foolish to pay so large a sum
o-f money to regain them." He rose
and seized his astrakhan coat.
Holmes was gray with anger and
mortification.
"Wait a little," he said. "You go too
fast. We should certainly make every
effort to avoid scandal In so delicate a
matter."
Milverton relapsed into his chair.
"I was sure that # you would see it in
that light," he purred.
â¢"At tre same time." nwmes con
tinued, "Lady Eva is not a wealthy
woman. I assure you that Â£2000 would
l>e a Orain upon her resources, and that
the sum you name is utterly beyond
her power. I beg therefore that you
will moderate your demands and that
you will return the letters at the price
I ; Indicate,- which is,- 1 ; assure ywx, thÂ«
highest that you can get."
.-â  Milvertbn's smile broadened and hiÂ»
eyes twinkled humorously.
. "I am aware that what you : Â»ay Is
true about the lady's resources," said -.
he. â ; "At â¢ the same time you ' must ad
mit that the occasion" of a lady's mar
riage s is - a very - suitable 'â  time â  for . her
friends and relatives to Â« make Â»omo .
little effort upon her behalf. They, may
hesitate las to an acceptable wedding
present. Let me assure them that this
little bundle of . letters â  would give
'. more joy " than all the candelabra and
butter-dishes in London."
'â â :<: < "It . is impossible,** said â¢ Holmes. .;â 
"Dear me. dear me. â¢ how unfortu
nate!" cried Milverton, taking out a
bulky pocket-book. "I cannot help
thinking . that ; ladies are ill-advised in
not making" an effort. Look at ; this!"
He held up a little note with a coat
of-arms upon' the envelope. "That be
longs to â well, perhaps it is hardly
fair to tell the name until to-morrow
morning. But at that time it will be in
the J hands of the lady's â¢ husband. And

garly": sum which she : could - get by
turning her \ diamonds < into 1 paste. It
is such a pity! Now you remember the
sudden end of the engagement be
tween the Honorable Miss â¢ Miles and
Colonel Dorkrng? â ? Only two days be
fore the wedding- there* was a para
graph in the Morning Post to say that
it was. all off. And' why? 'It Ab
almost â  incredible. .YTiut the absurd
sum of Â£1-00 would - have settled
the whole question. Is it not piti- '
ful? And here I ; -- find you, a man of
sense, boggling about terms, when your
client's * future and honor , are at stake.
You â¢'surprise * me. < Mr. Holmes. '
it "What I say is â¢ true, " Holmes answer- â¢
cd. "The money,:-", cannot be found.
Surely lit is better for you to take tha
â¢ substantial sum â¢ which I offer than to
â¢ruin this woman's career, which can Â»
profit you in no way? " " * "
â¢ "There you make a mistake. Mr.
' Holme 3. An exposure would profit .m*
~- Indirectly . to a considerable extent. I
luive eight or ten similar cases ma- '
turing. If it was _ circulated . among
them that I had 'made -a severe exam
ple of the Lady \Evjf.* I should find all
.' of them â¢ much , more Â«pen to reason.
You see my, point * "
/ Holmes sprang- from ; his chair.
: "Get behind him, Watson! : -- Don't ; let
him out! Nov. sir. leVus see the con
y' tents of that note book."
:-'- Milverton had i glided ; as quick as a
. rat to the ; side of .the .room, , and . stood
' with his back against the wall. ' â¢
*j â  â¢ "Mr. Holmes. â¢ Mr. > Holmes," he said.turning the front of his coat and ex
hibiting the butt of a large revolver,
which projected from the inside pocket.
"I have been expecting you to do some
thing original- Thjs has been done so
often, and what good has ever come
from it? I assure you that I am armed
to the teeth, and I am perfectly pre
pared to use my weapons, knowing
that the law will support me. Besides,
your supposition that I would bring
the letters here in a note book is en
tirely mistaken. I would do nothing so
foolish. And now, gentlemen, I have
one or two little interviews this even
ing and it is a long drive to Hamp-
Ft->ad." He Btepped forward, took up
his coat, laid his hand on his revolver
and turned to the door. I picked up a
chair, but Holmes shook his head and
I laid it down again- With a bow, a
smile and a twinkle. Milverton was out
of the room, and a few moments after
ye heard the slam of the carriage door
and the rattle of the wheels as he
drove away.
Holmes sat motionless by the fire, his
hands buried deep in his trousers pock
ets, his chin sunk upon his breast, his
fixed upon the glowing embers.
For half an hour he was silent and
still. Then, vuth the gesture of a man
who has taken his decision, he sprang
1 feet and passed into his bedroom.
A little later a rakish young workman,
with a goatee beard and a swagger, lit
his clay pipe at the lamp before de
scending into the street. "I'll be back
yome time, Watson," said he, and van
ished into the night. I understood that
he had opened his campaign against
Charles Augustus Milverton. but I lit
tle dreamed the strange shape which
that campaign was destined to take.
For some days Holmes came and
â went at all hours in this attire, but be
yond a remark that his time was spent
at Hampstead, and that it was not
v acted. I knew nothing of what he was
doing. At last, however, on a wild,
tempestuous evening, when the wind
streamed and rattled against the win
dows, he returned from his last expe
dition, and having removed his disguise
he sat before the fire and laughed
heartily in his silent inward fashion.
you wouid not call me a marrying
man, Watson?"
indeed!"
"You'll be interested to hear that I'm
engaged."
"My dear fellow! I congratâ "
"To Milverton's housemaid."
"Good heavens, Holmes!"
"I wanted information. Watson."
'"Surely you have gone too far?"
"It was a most r.f-cessary step. I am a
plumber with a rising business. Escott by
name. I have walked out with her each
eventng. and I have talked with her.
Good heavens, those talks!" However,
I have got all I wanted. I know Milve4
house aÂ« I know the palm of my
hand."
"But the girl, Holmes?"
He shrugged his shoulders.
"You can't help it, my dear Watson.
You must play your carÃs as best you
(&n when euch a stake is on the table.
However. I rejoice to say that I have a
hated rival, who will certainly cut me
out the instant that my back is turned.
What a splendid night it is!"
"You like this weather?"
"It suits my purpose. Watson, I
mean to burgle Milverton's house to
nighl."
I had a catching of the breath and
my skin went cold at the words, which
were slowly uttered in a tone of con
centrated resolution. As a flash of
lightning in the night shows up in an
instant every detail of a wild landscape,
so at a glance I seemed to see every
le result of such an actionâ the
detection, the capture, the honored ca
reer ending in irreparable failure and
disgrace, my friend himself lying at the
mercy of the odious Milverton.
"For heaven's sake. Holmes, think
what you are doing," I cried.
dear fellow, I have given it
â every consideration. 1 am never pre
' ipitate in my actions, nor would I
adopt so energetic ar.d, indeed, so dan
gerous a course if any other were pos
sible. Ltt us look at the matter clear
ly and fairly. I suppose that you will
admit that the action is morally justi
ciable, though technically criminal. To
burgle his house is no more than to
forcibly take hif pocketbookâ an action
io which you were prepared to aid me."
I turned it over in my mind.
"Yefi,"' I said, "it is morally justifi
able so long as our object is to take no
articles save those which are used for
an illegal purpose."
"Exactly. Fince it is morally justifi
able, I have only to consider the ques
tion of personal risk. Surely a gentle
man should not lay much stress upon
this when a lady is in most desperate
need of helo?"
"You will be in such a false position."
"Wei!, that is part of the risk. There
iÂ« no other possible way of regaining
these letters. The unfortunate lady has
not the money, and there are none of
h-r people in whom she could confide.
To-morrow is the last day of grace, and
unless we can get the letters to-night
this villain will be as good as his word
and will bring about her ruin. I must
tfore abandon my client to her fate
or I must play this last card. Between
ourselvo-s. Watson, it's a sporting duel
between this fellow Milverton and me.
He had, as you saw, the best of the
first exchanges, but my self-respect and
my reputation are concerned to fight It
to a finish."
"Well. I don't like it, but I suppose
It must be, " said I. "When do we
Start?"
"You are not coming."
"Then you are not going," said I. "I
rive you my word of honorâ and I nev
er broke it in my lifeâ that I will take
a cab straight to the police station and
give you away unless you let me share
this adventure with you."
"You can't help me."
"How do you know that? You can't
tell what may happen. Anyway, mv
resolution is taken. Other people besides
you have self-respect, and even repu
tations."
Holmes looked annoyed, but his
brow cleared, and he clapped me on
the shoulder.

"Well, well, my dear fellftw. be it
bo. We have shared this same room
for some years, and it would be amus

ceH. You know, Watson, I don't mind
confessing to you that I have always
had an fdea that I would have made a
highly efficient criminal. This is the
chance of my lifetime in that direc
tion. See here!" He took a neat lit
tle -leather case out of a drawer, and
ope/iing it he exhibited a number of
shining instruments, ''"ifhls Is a flrSt
class, up-to-date burgling kit, with
nickel-plated jimmy, diamond-tipped
glass-cutter/ adaptable keys and every
modern improvement which the
march of civilization demands. Here,
too, is my dark lantern. Everything
is in order. Have you a pair of silent
shoe*'.'"
"I have rubber-soled tennis shoes."
'â¢Excellent! And a mask?" â¢
"I can make a couple out of black
Bilk."
"'I can see that you have a strong,
natural turn for this sort of thing.
Very good dp you make the masks.
"We shall have some cold supper be
fore we start. It is now 9:30. At 11
we shall drive as far as Church Row.
It is a quarter of an hour's walk fram
there to Appledore Towers. We Bhall
be at work before midnight. Milver
ton is a heavy sleeper, and retires
punctually at 10:30. With any luck
we should be back here by 2, with the
Lady Eva's letters in my. pocket."
Holmes and I put on our dress
clothes, so that we might appear to
be two theater-goers homeward bound.
In Oxford street we picked up a han
som and drove to an address In Harop
stead. Here we paid off our cab ,and
with our great coats buttonad up, fpr
it was bitterly cold and "the *vind.
seemed to blow through U6, we walked
along the edge of the heath.
"'lt's a business that needs delicate
treatment," said Holmes. "These doc
uments are contained in a safe in the
fellow's fctudy, and the study is the
anteroom ot his bed chamber. / On
the other hand, like all these stout,
little men who do themselves well, he
is a plethoric sleeper. Agatha â that's
my fiancee â sajs it is a joke in the
servants' riaTl th^t it's HmposÃlble to
wake the master. He has a secretary
who is devoted to his interests, and
never budges from the study all day.
Thiit'r- why wo are going at night.
Then he has a beast of A dog which
roams the garden. I met Agatha late
the last two evenings, and she locks
the brute up so as to give me a clear
run. This is the house, this big one in
its own grounds. Through the gate â
now to the right among the laurels.
We might put oij our maskn here, I
think. You see. there is not a glim
mer of light in any of the windows,
and everything is working splendidly. "
With our black siik f ace-coverings,
which turned us into two of the most
truculent figures in London, we stole
up to the silent, gloomy house. A sort
of tiled veranda extended along one
side of it, lined by several windows
and two doors.
That's his bedroom," Holmes whis
pered. "This door opens straight into
the study. It would suit us best, but
it is bolted as well as locked, and we
should make too much noise getting
in. Come round here. There's a
greenhouse which opens into the
drawing-room." v
The place was locked, but Holmes
removed a circle of glass and tyrn?d
the key from the inside. An instant
afterward he had closed the door be
hind v.c. and ye had become felons
in the eye of the law. The thick, warm
air of the conservatory and the rich,
choking fragiam c of exotic plants
took us by the throat.
He seized my hand in the darkness and
led me swiftly past banks of shrubs,
which brushed against oui- laces.
Holmes had remarkable powers, cafe*
fully cultivated, of seeing in the dark.
Still holding my hand in one of his, he
opened a door, and I was vaguely con-
Bcioiu that we had ehtered a large
room In which a cigar had been smoked
nut long before. He felt his way among
the furniture, opened anothfer door, and
closed it behind us. Putting out my
hand I felt several coats hanging frum
the wal'., Â£nd I understood that I was
in a passage. We passed along it, ami
HoimeF very gently opened a door upon
the right-hand side. Something rushed
out at us and my heart sprang into my
mouth, but I could have laughed when
I realized lhat it was the cat. A fit>i
was burning in this new room, and
again the air was heavy with tobacco
smoke. Holme 3 entered on tiptoe, wait
ed for me to follow, and then very gen
tly closed the door. We were in Mii
vertoii'a study, and a portiere at the
farther side showed the entrance to hla
bedroom.
It was a good fire and the room was
illuminated by ii. Xeai" the door I saw
the gleam of an electric switch, but it
was unnecessary, even if it had been
safe, to turn it on. At one side of the
fireplace was a heavy curtain, which
< nvert'i the bay window we had seen
from outside. On the other side was
the door which communicated with the
veranda. A desk stood in the center,
with a turning chair of shining red
leather. Opposite was a large bookcase,
with a marble bust of Athene on the
top. In the corner between the book
case and the wall th%re stood a tall,
green safe, the firelight flashing back
from the polished brass knobs upon its
face. Holmes stole across and looked
at it. Then he crept to the door of the
bedroom, and 6tood with slanting head
listening intently. No sound came from
within. Meanwhile it had struck me
that it would be wise to secure our re
treat through the outer door, so I ex
amined it. To my amazement, it was
neither locked nor bolted. I touched
Holmes en the arm, and he turned his
masked face in that direction. I saw
him start, and he was evidently, as sur
prised as I.
"I don't like it." he whispered, put
ting his Hds to my very ear. "I can't
quite make it out. Anyhow, we have
no time to lose."
"Can I do anything?"
"Yes, stand by the door. If you hear
any one come bolt it on the inside, and
we can set away as we came. If they
cosas the other way we can get through
the door if our job is done, or hide be
hind these curtains if it is not. Do you
understand?"
I nodded and stood by the door. My
first feeling of fear had passed away,

than I had ever enjoyed when we were
the defenders o/ the law instead of Its
defiers. The high object of our mission,
the consciousness ,that it was Ainselfiah
atld chivalrous, the 1 ! villainous, character
of our opponent, all added to the sport
ing interest of the adventure,; Far from
feeling guilty/ 1. rejoiced and ejrufted in
our dangers. With a glow of admira
tion I watched Holmes unrolling hi*
case of instruments and choosing his
tool with the calm, scientific accuracy
of a surgeon who performs a delicate
opsration. I knew that the opening of
safes was a particular hobby with him,
and I understood the joy which it gave
him to be confronted with this green
and gold monster, the .dragon which
held in its maw the reputations of
many fair ladies. Turning up the cuffs
of his drees coat â he had placed hia
overcoat on a chairâ Holmes laid out
two drills, a jimmy and several skeleton
keys. I stood at the center door with my
eyes glancing at each of the others,
ready for any emergency, though, in
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
deed, my plans were somewhat vague
as to what I should do if we were in
terrupted. For half an hour Holmes
worked with concentrated energy, lay
ing down one tool, picking up another,
handling each with the strength and
delicacy of the trained mechanic.
Finally I heard a click, the
green door swung open, and inside I
-had a glimpse of a number of paper
packets, each. tied, sealed and in-
scribed. Holmes picked one out, but
it wa3 hard to read by the flickering
fire, and, he drew out his little dark
lantern, for it was too dangerous, with
Milverton in the next room, to switch
on the electric light. Suddenly I saw
him halt, listen intently, and then in
an instant he had swuns the door of
the safe to, picked up his coat, stuffed
his tools into the pockets, and darted
behind the window curtain, motioning
me to do the same.
It was only when I had joined him
there that I heard what had alarmed
hie quicker senses. There was a noise
somewhere within the house. A door
slammed in the distance. Then a con
fused, dull murmur broke Itself Into
the measured thud of heavy footsteps
rapidly approaching:. They were in
the passage outside the room. They
paused at the door. The door opened.
There was a sharp snick as the electric
light was turned on. The. door closed
once more,. and the pungent reek of a
strong cigar was borne to our nostrils.
Then the footsteps continued back-
wards and forwards, backwards and
forwards, within a few yards of us.
Finally there was a creak from a
chair, and the footsteps ceased. They
ft key clicked in a lock, and 1 heard
the rustle of papers.
So far I had not dared to look out,
Â£ut now I gently parted the division of
*he curtains in front of me and peep
ed through. From the pressure of
Holmes' shoulder against mine. I knew
that he was sharing my observations.
Right in front of us, and almost with
in our reach, was the broad, rounded
back of Milverton. It was evident
Â»that we had entirely miscalculated his
movements, that he had never been to
his bedroom, but that he had been
sitting up in some smoking or billiard
room in the farther wing of the house,
the windows of which we had not seen.
His broad, grizzled head, with its shin
ing patch of baldness, was in the im
mediate foreground of our vision. He
was leaning back in the red leather
chair, his legs outstretched, a long,
black cigar projecting at an angle
from his mouth. He wore a semi
military smoking Jacket, claret-color
ed, with a black velvet collar. In his
hand he held a long, legal document
which he was reading in an indolent
fashion, blowing rings of tobacco
ernoke from his lips as he did so. There
was no promise of a speedy departure
in his composed bearing and his com
fortable attitude.
. I felt Holmes' hand steal into mine
and give me a reassuring shake, as if
to aay that the situation was within
his powers, and that hÂ« was t-asy in
his mind. I was not sure whether he
had seen what was only too obvious
from my position, that the door of the
safe was imperfectly closed, and that
Milverton might at any moment ob
serve it. In my own mind I had de
termined that if I were sure, from the
rigidity of his gaze, that it had caught
his eye, I would at once spring out,
throw my great coat over his head,
pinion him, and leave the rest to
Holmes. But Milverton never looked
up. He was languidly interested by
the paper in his hand, and page after
page was turned aa he followed the
argument of the lawyer. At least, I
thought, when he had finished the
document and the cigar he will 50 to
his room, but before he had reached
the end of either, there came a
remarkable development, which turned
our thoughts into quite another chan
nel.
Several times I had observed that
Milverton looked at his watch and
once he had risen and sat down again,
with a gesture of impatience. The
idea, however, that he might have an
appointment at so strange an hour
never occurred to me until a faint,
sound reached my ears from the ve
randa outside. Milverton dropped his
papers and sat rigid in his chair. The
sound was repeated and then there
came a gentle ta*> at the door. Mil
verton rose and opened it.
, "Well," said he curtly, "you are
nearly half an hour late."
So this was the explanation of the
unlocked door and of the nocturnal
vigil of Milverton. There was the
gentle rustle of n woman's dress. I
had closed the slit between the cur
tains as Mllverton's face had turned
in our direction, but now I ventured
very carefully to open It once more.
He had resumed his seat, the cigar
still projecting at an insolent angle
from the corner of his mouth. In front
of him in the full glare - the electric
light there stood a tall, slim, dark wo
man, a veil over her face, a mantle
drawn round her chin. Her breath
came quick and fast and every inch
of the lithe figure was quivering with
Btrong emotion.
'â¢Well," said Milverton, "you've made
me lose a good night's rest, my dear.
1 hope you'll prove worth it. You
couldn't come any other time â eh?"
The woman shook her head.
"Well, if you couldn't you coÂ«ldn't.
If the Countess is a hard mistress you
have your chance to get level with her
now. Bless the girl, what are you
shivering about? That's right. Pull
yourself together. Now let us g^t
down to business." He took a note
book from the drawer of his desk.
"You say that you have five letters
which compromise the Countess d'Al
bert. You want to sell them. I want
to buy them. So far so good. It only
remains to fix a price. I should want
to inspect the letters, of course. If
they are really good specimens â Great
heavens, is it you?"
The woman, without a word, had
raised her veil and dropped the man
tje from her chin. It was a dark,
handsome, clear-cut face which con
fronted Milverton â a face with a
curved nose, strong, dark eyebrows
shading hard, glittering eyes, and a
straight, thin-lipped mouth set in a
dangerous smile.
"It is I," she said, "the woman whose
life you have ruined."
Milverton laughed, but fear vibrated
in his voice. "You were so very ob
stinate," said he. "Why did you drive
me to such extremities? I assure you
I wouldn't hurt a My of my own ac
cord, but every man has his business,
and what was I to do? I put the price
well within your means. You would
not pay."
"So you sent the letters to my hus
band and he â the noblest gentleman
that ever lived, a man whose boots I
was never worthy to lace â he broke
his gallant heart and died. You re
member that last night, when I came
through that door. I begged and prayed
you for mercy, and you laughed in my
face as you are trying to laugh now,
only your coward heart cannot keep
your lips from twitching? Yes, you
never thought to see me here again,
but it was that night which taught me
how I could meet you (ace to face and
alone. Well, Charles Milverton, what
have you to say?"
"Don't Imagine that you can bully
me," said he, rising to his feet. "I
have only to raise my voice and I could
call my servants and have you ar
rested. But I will make allowance for
your natural anger. Leave the room
at once as you came and I will say no
more."
The woman stood with her hand
burled in her bosom and the same
deadly smile on her thin lips.
"You will ruin fto more lives as you
have ruined mine. You will wring no
more hearts as you wrung mine. I
will free the world of a poisonous
thing. Take that, you hound â and that.'
âand that!â and that!â and that!"
She had drawn a little gleaming re
volver and emptied barrel after barrel
into Milverton's body, the muzzle with
in two feet of his shirt front. He
shrank away and then fall forward
upon the table, coughing furiously and
clawing among the- papers. Then he
staggered to his feet, received another
shot and rolled upon the floor. "You've
done me." he cried, and lay still. The
woman looked at him intently and
: ground her heel into his up.turr.ed : f ace.
She looked again, but there was no
sound or movement. I heard a sharp
rustle. th 3 night air blew into the
heated* room and the. avenger was gone.
;â ; No interference upon our part could
have \ saved ,-; the man * from .; his fate, *
; but, as.* the woman poured bullet after

â fl was about to spring -out, when [

that it was no affair of ours, that, Jus
tice had overtaken a;. villain, that we
had our, own duties and our own ob
jects, which were not to be '.oat sight
of.- But hardly had the woman rushed
from the room when Holmes, with
swift, silent steps, was over at the
other door. He turned the key in the
lock. At the same instant he heard
voices in the house and the sound of
hurrying feet. The revolver, shota had
reused the household. With perfect
coolness Holmes slipped across to the
safe, filled his two arms with bundles
of letters and poured them all into the
fire. .Again and asain'he did it. until
the safe was empty. Some one turned
the? handle and beat upon the outside \
of the door. .Holme* looked swiftly
around. .The letter which had been

through aft-*- me and locked It on the
outside. "This way, Watson." said he.
"we can scale the garden wall in this
direction." , . -I .Â«.
I could not have believed that an
alarm could have . spread so swiftly.
Looking back, the huge house was one
blaze of light. The front, door was
open and figures were rushing; .down
the drive. The whole garden was alive
with people, and one -fellow rsjfl. a

veranda and followed hard at our heels.

swiftly among a- plantation of small
trees, I close at his heels, and our fore
most pursuer panting behind : iiÂ». * It
was a sis-foot wall ; which barred oar
path, but he sprang to the top -and
over. As I did the same I felt the hand
of. the man Behind me grab at. my
ankle, but I kicked myself free . and
scrambled over a grass-strewn coping.
I' fell upon my face among some
bushes, - but Holmes â  had me ion â  my
feet ii â an instant, and together- we
dashed away across, the huge expanse
of Hampstead Heath. We had run two
miles. I suppose, before Holme? at last
baited and listened. intently. All was
absolute silence behind us. "We rjad
shaken off our pursuers and were safe.
We had breakfasted and were smok
ing our morning pipe on the day after

have recorded, when Mr. Lestrade of

. "Good morning. Mr. Holmes," said
he;- "good morning. . May I ask if you

"I thought that, perhaps, if yon had
nothing particular, on hand, you might
care to assist us in a most remarkable

"Pear me!" said Holmes. "What was
that?" - . . -.'

"It's true," said the Inspector, with
amusement. "It might be a description

â¢.."Well. I'm afraid I can't help you,

that I knew this fellow Milverton.. that

No, It's no use arguing. I have made
up my. mind. My sympathies are with

Holmes had not said one -word to mÂ©
about the tragedy which we had wit
nessed, but I observed all thÂ« morning
that he was in his most- thoughtful
mood, and he gave me the Impression,
from his vacant eyes and his abstracted
manner, of a man who is striving tore
call something \to his : memory. -We
were in the middle of our lunch when

we had almost reached Regent Circus.
Here, on the left hand, there stands a

the celebrities and beauties of the day.
Holmes* eyes fixed themselves upon one
of them, and following his gaze I saw
the picture of a regal and stately lady
in court dress, with a high diamond
tiara upon her noble head. I looked at
that delicately curved nose, at tha
marked eyebrows. , at the straight
mouth and the strong little chin be

I read the time-honored title of the â

what was expected of him.
It was growing dusky as . they
emerged. The group before the shop
had run to watch the great surgeon
alighting from the water stairs. The
dozen steps that brought* them to the
open piazetta they walked in silence.
There Teresa paused, wishing to say
she knew not what, burning with sym
pathy, yet timid with confusion. The
street seemed to wear an unwonted,
unevcryday luster, yet she knew
that around the corner lay
little Pasquale, woefully hurt,
la full view Tita was unlash
ing the gondola, and acrots the piaz
zetta she could see the entrance of the
caffe where her father was sipping
his cognac. A fear lest the latter
should appear and find her absent from
the gondola mixed with the wave of
feeling with which she held out her
hand to the man beside her.
"Poor little fig-merchant! " she saidâ
the scere with the mother was too
painfully recent to touch upon at once.
â "He watched for mv gondola every
day. l hope he is not badly hurt-
What do you think. SiÂ£nore?"
"No bones *vcre broken," he rejoined.
'But cs to internal injury, I could not
tell. I fhall hope doubly for him," he
added, "since you love him."
Htr tyts sought the ground, suddenly
shy. "i have loved him from the first.
You know, he cannot play like other
childien- He Is tune; 1 think that is
Miy 1 love him."
<* Â£Â«ordun's lips compressed, his cheeks
flu^h.. a with an odd sensitiveness that
had long bsen calloused. But he saw
instantly that the remark had been
innocent of allusion. A weird forgot-
ton memory shot Jaggedly through his
brain. Years ago â how many yeais
â¢ ago â he hud overheard a girl's voice
repeat a mocking antithesis: "Do you
think I could ever care for that lame
boy?" This girl facing him had the
same fair hair and blue eyes of that
Â«. boviFh love of his- The resemblance
caught him. "Was it this that had
haunted him In the miniature? Was
this subconscious influence what had
inspired at La Mira his aching desire
that she should not think worse of him
than might be?
Her voice recalled him. She had not
understood that veiled look, but it
brought to her lips what had been
nearest to her thought â the resentment
and regret that the virago's shrilling
voice had roused.
"What must you think of our Venice,
Signore!" she said. "But they knew
not betterâ those poor people. They
cannot tell evil from good."
â  It Is no matter, SignorinV" Gordon
' answered. "Do not give it a thought.
It was not unnatural, perhaps."
"Not unnatural!" she echoed
"Natural to think you evil? Ah, Slg
nore â when. your every touch was kind

She paused abruptly, coloring under
his gaze..; ;j^;A'iV
.The words and the flush had cut him
like a knife. ; The lines of ravage .he
had challenged In the mirror her inno
cence, ha& misread. In the olive wood
ehe had seen only wretchedness, here
only .mercy. . . . .
"The face is sorry index, sometimes,
Eignorina. In mine the world may not
see what you see."
He had schooled his tone to light
ness, but her mood, still tense-drawn,
felt its strain. She spoke impulsively,
bravely;, her heart beating hard. Â
"What I see there â it is pain, not
evil. Signore: sorrow, but not all your
own; loneliness and regret and feelings
'hat people like those" â threw. out
her hand, in a passionate- gesture
toward the" shop â never under-
A etand." < .
H' ."It is only Mirh as they." he inter-,
posed.'- "The world, your world, would
not understand, either. It Is only here
and there one finds one like you, Slg
âins â with sympathy as pure as
joins."
Her face had turned the tint
that autumn paints wild straw
berry leaves, a rich, translucent
flush that deepened the light in v
her eyes. It was a lyric world to
day! Just then Tlta's voice spoke
warningly from the waterside. She â 
looked around, and through the gath
ering, shadows, saw her father's form
standing in the door of the caffe across
the piazzetta.
"Oh!" she said confusedly, and turn
ing, hastily crossed the pavement to
the gondola. , \
Tita's oar swung vigorously on the
return, for Count Gamba was in haste.
He was voluble, but Teresa, as she
looked out through the curtains, was
Inattentive.
Swiftly as they went, a gondola out
stripped them on the canal. It held the
low-browed carpenter whom Tita had
throttled in the shop. In addition' to
a superstitious mind, the carpenter
possessed a malicious tongue and loved
a sensation. He .knew that the father
of little Pasquale was at work that day
on the Giudecca. ÂAs the doctor had >
driven all save 'the mother from the
shop, there was little profit to be got
by remaining. He therefore hastened
to bear the news to the quay where
the stonemasons labored overtime. He
had drawn his own conclusions. The
child was mortally hurtâ dying, doubt-
I*Â»esâ and as he, revolved In his mind
the words with which he should make
the announcement to the father, â  the
wicked milord and his evil eye entered
with all their, dramatic values.
Teresa noted the speed of the gondola
as it passed to tie to the rising wall.
saw the gesticulations of the blue-dad
â¢rkmen as the man It bore < told his
iT story. Even in the failing light she
saw the gesture of grief and despair
with which one, the center, of all eyes,
threw up his arms and sank down on.
to the stones, his head in y his hands.
As her father's gondola swept by, the
THE CASTAWAY
figure sprang up suddenly and his
brown hand flew to his belt.
My Pasqur.le â dead!" he shouted;
"I 11 kill the Inglese!"
Teresa heard a stifled cry. Her fath
er had seen and heard also, though he
dia not know t the explanation. Nor
couJd he have guessed what an icy
fear had gripped the heart of the girl
beside him.
â 'An ugly look!" he muttered, as the
frantic form scrambled into the car
penter's craft.
Teresa could not speak. Her horri
fied gaze was on the sinister face, the
red cap like a sans-culotte, the eye
g.iincini; under it tigerishly. little
Pasquale was dead then! The father
blamed the Englishman. His look was
one of murder! He would kill himâ
of whom she had thought and dreamed,
the man in whose heart had been only
tenderness! Kill him? A panging
dread seized her. She felt as if she
must cry out; and all the time Tita's
oar swept her on through the dusk,
farther away from him whom danger
threatenedâ him whom, In some way,
no mutter haw, she must warn!
A. strange helplessness descended
upon her- She did not even know his
name, or his habitation. To her he was
but one of the hundreds Tita had said
were in Venice. That the gondolier
himself could have enlightened her did
not cross her mind. She felt the im
possibility of appealing to her father
she had not even dared tell him she had
left Ihe gondola. What could she do?
Truft to Tlta to find him? Could he
know every line of that face as did
she? Even In the dark â in crowds â she
told herself that she would know
him. would somehow feel his
prr-KPnce. But how to do It?
How to elude the surveillance at home?
And If phe could do so, wnere to look
for him?
Her reverie was broken by the gon
dola's bumping against the landing.
Her father's talk had been running on
like a flowing spout.
"A palazzo in Ravenna finer than
this," he was saying, "and you the
Conteesa Guiccioli! Shall we not be
proud â eh, my Teresa?"
She realized suddenly of what he had
been babbling. As she disembarked at
the water-stairs, she looked up at the
balcony. There, beside the stately Con
tessa Albrizzi, an old man, was lean
ing, hawk-eyed, white-haired and thin.
He blew her a kiss from his sallow
fingers.
Her nervous tension relaxed in a sud
den Quiver of aversion.
"No, no!" she said in a choked voice,
with clinched fingers. "I will not marry
till I choose! Why must every one be
In such haste?"
And with these broken sentences, that
left her father standing in blank as

CHAPTER, XXVIII.
The Haunted Man.
Mocenigo was dark as Gordon entered
save for the single lamp always lit at
nightfall. Fletcher served his master's
to-night, as too often happened, it was
scarcely tasted. Long aftea the valet
had retired, his watchful ear heard the
uneven step pacing rip and down, up
and down, on the echoing floor.
A restless mood was upon Gordon,
the restlessness of infinite yearning and
discontent. He was tasting anew the
gall and wormwood of self-reproach.
He had felt the touch of Teresa's
hand as it lay against the couch in
that squalid roomâ had known it
trembledâ and the low words she had
spoken in the street, standing, as it
seemed to him. with that forest shrine
ever for background, were still in his
ears.
He had seen her but twice, for but a
few brief moments. Once she had come
to him on the wings of a prayer; and
again to-day over the hurt body of a
child. Each meeting had touched the
raw nerve in him which had first
throbbed to anguish at sight of her
miniature. Each time he had heard a
voice call to hljn as if it were the
ghost of some buried thing he had one
day known and lost, speaking a
tongue sweet though untranslatable.
Hours went by. Gordons step flag
ged. He approached the desk on
which were scattered distraught
leaves of manuscript, blotted and in
terlined. He swept these into his
hand and read for a moment. Be
neath the outer crust of flippancy and
satire a strange new development had
begun. But the mental habit had per
sisted strong during the moral boule
versement, as the polar glaze spreads
its algid mockery above the warm
currents of an Arctic spring. How his
muse had bemocked him, he thought.
A drama of madness, whose dramatis
personae were magicians and spirits
of the nether world â stanzas hover
ing between insane laughter and
heartbroken sobs, between supplica
tions and blasphemies â cantos whose
soul was license, though their sur
rj â ?58Â£oyÂ£ l lhjailS
passing music thrilled like the laugh
ter of a falling Lucifer!
He flung the sheets down, went to
the window and threw it open, lean
ing out across the .balcony that hung
over the canal. It was a night of
Italian sorcery, the sky an infinite
wistaria canopy nailed with white
blown stars; of musical water shim
mering into broken bits of moon; of
misty silver air. Around and beneath
him spread the enchanted city, a mar
vel of purple and mother-of-pearl, a
jewel in verd and porphyry. Gondo
lns, dim iv the muffled shadow, or
ablaze with strung lanterns and echo-
Ing with tinkling virginals and softer
In lighter, glided below on their way
lo the masked ball of the Cavalchina.
The fleeting thrill, the bubble pageant;
what did they all â what did anything
neap now for him ?
Lopking out, Gordon's gaze went
far. He had a vision of England as
he had last seen it across the jasper
channel â green fields and white
cliffs in a smother of vapors: of Lon
don with its pomp, its power, its cal
umnies, its wicked magical vitality.
And he spoke of it, murmuring sen
tences not sneering now, but broken
with a stranger soft emotion:.
"What you have doneâ you island of
home! If I could tell you! I had the
immortal flameâ the touch of the di
vine! It was mineâ all mine, for the
world! You took meâ my boyhood and
embittered it, my youth and debauched
it, my manhood And robbed It! You
jeered my first songs and it stung me,
and when I cried out in pain you
laughed and flattered. When you tired
of me you branded me with this mark
and cast me out!" He turned again to
the desk where lay the manuscript.
"What I write now has the mark of
the beast! It is the seraph's song with
the satyr laugh cutting up through it,
and the cloven hoof of the devil Â«f
hatred that will not down In me! And
yet I wrote the poem that she loves!
I wrote thatâ l! My God! It was only
two years ago! And now â shall I never
hear that voice singing In my soul
again? Shall I never write so again?
Never â never â never?"
A pungent, heavy smell of flower*
filled his nostrils. He turned from the
window, quivering. Fletcher had en
tered behind him and" was arranging
a mass of blooms in a bowl.
The Fornarina! She had returned
from Naples ftien. It was her barbaric
way of announcing her coming, for she
could not write. She had been absent
a month â how much had happened in
that month!
The man. with the excoriate surface
of recollection exposed, with the quick
of remorse laid open suddenly, could
not bear it. He threw a cloak about
him and wenj rapidly down to the
water-stairs.
The gondolier came running to the
steps, catching up the long oar as he
jprang to position.
"Whither, Excellence?" he asked.
A burst of music, borne on the air
across roofs and up echoing canals,
came faintly to Gordon from the far
away Square of St. Mark.
"To the Piazza," he said.
CHAPTEU XXIX.
Teresa's Awakening.
Teresa, meanwhile, had been facing
her problem â how to warn the Eng
lishman of his danger. During the
slow hours while Gordon sat gazing
into the distorted mirror of his own
thought, she had traversed every
causeway of risk, sounded every well
of possibility.. To a young girl of the
higher class in Venice, a night trip,
uncavaliered, held elements of grave
peril. Discovery spelled lasting dis
grace perhaps, certainly the anger of
her father. All this she was ready to
hazard. But beyond was the looming
probability that she qould not find the
object of her search after all. How
ever, it was a chance, and fear, with
another sentiment that she did not
analyze .impelled -her to take it.
It was an easy taÂ«k to win Tlta, for
he would have denied her nothing* To
him, however, she told only a part of
the truth â that he wished once to see
the Piazza by night. Only an hour in
the music and lights in his car, and
then quick and safe return to the
Palazzo Albrizzi. The house servants
she could answer for. Who would be
the wiser?
So, a little while after Gordon had
been set down that night at the Molo,
another gondola, lampless and with
drawn tenda, stole swiftly to a side
landing, and Teresa, closely veiled,
with Tita by her side, stepped into the
square, beneath the Hare of its flam
beaux, into its currents of eddying
maskers where the white fazzioli of
the lower order mingled with the rich
costumes of patricians, all alike stung
by the tarantula of gayety; a flashing
sea of motion and color surging end
lessly beneath a sky alive with winged
spots of gray and black â the countless
pigeons that circled there undisturbed.
She had chosen the Piazza after
much deliberation. It was ' the last
night of the carnival, when all the
world of Venice was on the streets.
At the new Penice Theater the latest
opera of Rossini was playing, and
there was the ball of the Cavalchina,
the final throb before the dropping of
the pall of Lent. The sadness in Gor
don's face, she felt, had no part in
these things. She felt instinctively
that he would be spectator rather than
actor, would choose the open air of
the square rather than the indoors.
The danger she feared for him would
not seek him In a crowd; it would
lurk in some silent byway and strike
unseen. ' The thought made her trem
ble as she peered about her.
The center of the Piazza was a pool,
fed and emptied by three streams of
HALLIE ERMINIE
RIVES
people; one flowing under the clock
tower with its blue and gold dial and
bronze figures, one through the west
entrance under the Bocca di Piazza,
and still -another rounding the Doges*
Palace and meeting the thronged Riva.
It was on the fringe of this second
stream that she saw him, when the
hour was almost ended. He wa3
standing in the shadow of the pillars,
watching, she thought, yet abstracted.
With a whispered word to Tita she
ran and touched the moveless figure
on the arm.
Gordon turned instantly, and turn
ing, spoke her name half-aloud. "Ter
est!" The utterance was almost auto
matic, the lips, startled, voicing the
â word that was in his mind at the
moment.
She thought he recognized her
through the veil, and answered with
a cry expressing at' one time her re
lief at finding him, and a quick delight
that thrilled her at the Bound of her
name on his lips. Many things had
wrought together to produce this new
miracle of gladness. The strangeness
and romance of their first meeting, the
tragedy of loneliness she had guessed
in the scene at the shop, her dread
and the physical risk entailed in her
adventure of this night, all had com
bined with cunning alchemy. When
he spoke she forgot to be surprised
that he had called her by name, for
got that she did not know his. forgot
everything save his presence and her
errand.
He leaned forward, breathing deep
ly. It was she! She put her veil aside
quicklyâ her eyes were like 3apphire
stones! â and told him hurriedly of the
threat she had heard, of her dread, all
in a rush of sentences incoherent and
unstudied.
"And so you came to warn me?"
"He would do it, Signore! Ah, I
saw his face when he said it. You
must be guarded. You must not go
abroad alone!"
His mind was busy. How much she
had jeopardized to reach him in that
fancied danger! She, in Venice, a
young girl of noble rank, with no es
cort save a gondolier! Risk enough
for her in any case: what an endur
ing calamity if she should be seen and
recognized there, with him!
He led her back between the pillars,
put out his hand and drew the veil
again across her face, speaking grave
ly and gently:
"What you have done is a brave and
nable thing; one I shall be piad of
always. It was no less courageous,
nor am I less graoteful, though what
you heard was a mistake. Little Pas
quale is not dead. I spoke with the
surgeon here less than a half-hour
ago. He had Just come from the piat
zetta. The child will recover."
"Oh, thank God!" she breathed. She
clasped her hands In very abandon
ment. "The blessed Virgin has heard
me!"
His heart seemed suddenly to cease
beating. The exclamation was a reve
lation far deeper than she divined. It
was not. joy at the life of the child
that was deepest in it â it was some
thing, else: a great relief for him. He
felt the blood tingle to his finger-tips.
Only one emotion cuuld speak in such
an accent â only one!
With an uncontrollable imoulse he
leaned to her aud clasped both her
hands!
"You cared. Teresa." he said. "You
risked so much â for me?"
He had spoken her name again.
Again she felt the stab of that quiver-
Ing spear of gladness. Her lingers
fluttered in his.
"Yes â yes!" she whispered. The-
shouts, the music, the surge and
laughter around faded. She felt her
self, unafraid, drifting on a sea of
unplummeted depths.
A shock of fright brought her to
herself. A man bent and dressed
richly, with an affectation of youth,
was passing, attended by a servant.
As they approached, the keen-eyed
servitor had pointed out Gordon.
â¢That Is the evil Englishman. Excel
lence, of whom you have heard," lie
had said, and the old noble he led
had set his keen eyes on the other
with a chuckling relish.
Teresa, in the momentary pause
they made, hardly repressed a cry, for
that moment discovery seemed to her
immlrfent. The old man was the
Count Guiccialiâ he who had leaned
that afternoon from the palazzo bal
cony. Her pulses leaped to panic. dhÂ«j
felt as if that sharp gaze must gu
through the veil, and pressed closer to
Gordon.
But master and servant passed on.
and her fear fainted out.
The man beside her had felt that
Quick pressure, and instinctively the
touch of his arm reassured her, though
he had not surmised her alarm, In
that instant Gordon had been thinking
like lightning. A temptation had
sprung full-statured bctore him. In,
a flash he had read the dawning secret
behind those eyes, the sweet unspoken
things beneath those trembling lips
crimson-soft U poppy leaves. To pos
sess this heart ror his own! Xot to
tell her who he was â not yet, when
her purity would shrink â to Murture
this budding regard with meetings like
this, stolen troni fate â to cherish it till
it burst into tlower for him, all en
grossing, supreme! To make this love,
fluttering to him unsought in the pur
lieus of his souls despair, his solace
and his sanctuary!
Coincidence grappled with him â a
stealthy persuasion. In the crisis of
his madness, when at Geneva, he had
cursed every good thing, her pictured
face had sought him out to go with
him. Into the nadir of his degradation
there in Venice it had dropped like a
falling star to call him to himself.
Fate had led him to her in the woods
of La Mira â had brought them both
face to face at the shop in the piaz
zetta â and now had led. her to him
again her in the midst of the maskers,
it was Kismet!
â¢"I did not think there was more
than one in all the world who would
have done what you have to-night!"
he said; "that would have cared if I
lived or died! Why do you care?"
"Ah!" she- answered hurriedly. "Is
there one who would not." I do not
know why. One does not reason of
such things. one feels. I know I
have cared â ever since that morning
in the wood, when you found the book,
â¢when I gave you the prayer!"
He started, releasing her hands.
"Intercede and obtain for me of thy
Son, our Lord, this grace!" It seemed
to come to him from the air, a de
moniac echo to his desire. His breath
choked him. She had prayed for him,
purely, unselfishly. How should he
requite? To-night, for his sake she
had risked reputation. How did he
purpose to repay.' Would not the
doing of this thing sink him a thou
sand black leagut-3 below the sky she
breathed. No matter how much she
might come to love, could it recom
pense for what he would talo* away?
Between those two lay a gulf as deep
as that which stretched between cool
water and â  tortured Dives. What
had l*e, George Gordon, dragging the
chain and bail of a life sentence of
despair, to do with her in her purity?
He yearned for her because she was
an immaculate thing; because she re
incarnated for him all the white, un
spotted Ideals that he had thrown
away, that he longed to touch again,
it was the devil tempting in the pie*
of tin angel!
The mist fell from his eyes.
"Child!" he said. What you nayÂ«
done to-night I can never repay. I
shall remember it until I die. But I
am not worthy of your thought â not
worthy of a single throb of that hearC
of yours!"
She shook her head protesting.
"That cannot be true," she contend
ed. "But if it were, Signore, one can
not say "I will,' or 'I will not care*
when one chooses." Her tone was
naive, and arch with a smiling, shy
rebellion.
"Listen," he went on. "Do not think
me jesting. What I say now I say be
cause I must. I want you to promise
me you will do something â something;
only for your good. I swear that!"
The smile faded from her lips,
chilled by his earnestness.
"When you go -from here you must
forget that day at La Mira. forget that
you came to-night â that we have ever
met! Will you pVomise this?"
Her whole mind was a puzzled ques
tion now. Did he mean she should
see him no more? Was he quitting
Venice? The thought came like a
pang. Biit to forget! Could she if
she would? Why did he say it was
for her good? A fear, formless and
vague, ran through her.
"Why do you ask that. Signore?"
He turned his face away. It waa
so much harder than he thought.
Must he tell her who he was? Could
he not carry with him this one mem
ory? Must he drink this cup of
abnegation to its last dregs? The very
kindness of silence would be cruelty
for her! The seed fate had sown,
watered by mystery, would germinate
ta thorns! He must tell Her â tell her
now!
The press of masker* flooding the
square circled nearer, and she drew
close. Ht-r hand from under her
cloak, found hLs own, suddenly fearful,
feeling bold looks upon them.
"Bravo la Fornarina !" rose a jeering
cry. An exclamation broke from Gor
don's lips. A woman had burst from
the throng like a beautiful embodied
storm. Teresa shrank with, a sob of
dismay at the vision of flashing black
eyes and dark hair streaming across
jealous brows.
The crowd laughed.
"It is l'lnglese maligno:" said 3
voice.
Evading Gordon's arm, with a
spring like a tigers, the infuriate fig
ure reached the girl, snatching at the
veil.
"So he prefers you for his donna.'."tht sneered savagely. "Let us see,
vhite face!"
The rent gauze dropped to the
ground.
tfudden stillness fell. The Jests and
jeers hushed. Teresa stood motion-

dark gondola.
He set her on the cushions and plied
the oar till it smoked in its socket.
Th? bright canals fled byâ she had
not moved. By darker passages he
went now and very slowly, threading
stagnant i lighted alleys. The way
opened out. a swish of trailing tendrils
swept across the oar â they were un
der â  vine-trellised bridge. _ The
lampless gondola crept along the" wall,
stole with sudden swiftness across a,
patch or moonbeams and darted into
the shadowy water-gate.
Tita had thought the canal quite de
serted. But beyond the. moonlight an
other craft had been drowsing by. The
ola man under its tenda had been
musing on the loveliness . of â¢ a girl
â within those walls whom he, should
soon possess, and with her a dowry,
set aside at her birth, which the wan
ing fortunes of her family hud pre
served intact. He saw the dark bulk
shoot into the gilded water-gate and
peered out.
"What was that?" he demanded,
"A gondola, surely. Excellence."
Garden water-gates seldom swung
in Venice at night. For a moment he
watched. Some servant's errand, " he
reflected, and leaned back on the cush
ions.
In the orchid-scented garden. Tita's
brawny arms lifted Teresa out and set
her upon the marble steps. He was
thinking of the Englishman.
"Illustrissima!" he whispered.
"Shall 1 kill him?"
No. no, Tita! Dear Tita! Not
that! I would rather die myself!"

- heard only an echo rolling
â  blank Infinities!
The moon sank. The great, linked
- of the heavens burned brighter,
raded at length, and a breath of sea
breeze, harbinger of the dawn, struck
coldly on his cheek. Night became
soft twilight, twilight grew to warm
amethyst. Little milky clouds dappled
ihe zenith, slowly guffused by a flush
of rose that grew to vivid splendor
gray-streaked, as the sun's climbing
edge touched the humid horizon.
The occupant of the gondola stirred
and looked about him. The air was
full of mewing swallows, and a sandy
island lay before him from which rose
tlumps of foliage and the dim outlines
of brown etone walls, gilded by the
growing light. The gondolier's voice
broke the long silence:
"It is the Armenian monastery of
Saint Lazarus, Excellence."
The island lay lapped in quiet. Not
a sound or movement intrenched upon
Ha peace. Only the swallows circled
shrilly about slim bell-towers, lifting
like fingers pointing silently. A nar
row causeway through an encircling
dike led to the wharf, and beyond, by
a gate, to an orchard where gnarled
fruit trees sniffed the salt air. From
a chimney at one side a strand of
smoke sheered slenderly.
Gordon drew a long breath. "Put
me ashore," he said.
The gondola shot alongside the tiny
wharf, and he stepped on its stone
flags. He stood silent a moment, feel-
Ing the calm upon him like a tangible
hand. Far to the north, half a
league's distance, glowing through the
bluish winter haze, shone the towers
and domes of Venice, a city of white
and violet, vague and unsubstantial as
a dream, a field of Iris painted upon a
cloud.
"Go back to the city."
The Bervant was startled. "And
leave you. Excellence?"
"Yee, I shall send when I need you."
The boatman leaned anxiously on
his oar. "When they question. Excel
lence V
"Tell no one but Fletcher where I
am. Say to him it is my wish that he
shall not leave the pa-lawo."
He watched the gondola glide away
over the lightening waters, till it was
only a spot on the dimpling lagoon.
He took a black phial from his pocket
and threw it far out into the water.
Then he turned his gaze and walked
up the wharf toward the monastery,
still soundless and asleep.
At the corner of the seawall, the
etone had been hollowed with the
chisel into a niche, in which, it face
turned seaward, stood a small leaden
image of the 'Virgin. He noted It cu
riously, with the same sensation of the
unartlncial he had felt at sight of the
wooden shrine at La Mira. And yet
â with all its primitive simplicity, what
a chasm between euch a concrete em
bodiment of a personal guardianship
and that agnostic altar his youth had
erected "to the unknown God!"
He looked up and saw a figure near
him.
A man of venerable look Â«tood there,
bareheaded, with a wide gray beard
which swept upon his coarse dark
robe. Hfc eyes were deep and pleas
ant, and his countenance spiritual,
gracious and reserved. An open gate
in the wall showed the way he had
come.
For a moment neither spoke. The
lucent graze confronting him seemed to
Gordon to possess a strange familiar
ity; it was the same expression of un
worldly sincerity that had shone In
those London days from Dallas' face.
"What do you seek, my son?"
Perhaps the friar had already had
time to study the visitor. Perchance
the clear scrutiny had read something
beneath that cryptic look bent upon,
the ihrine. What did he not seek, in
deed! *
When Gordon answered it was sim
ply, in Italian aa direct as the other's
question.
"The peace of your walla and fields
drew me; Padre. By your leave, I
would rest a while here."
The frlar'e look had not wavered.
Contemplation teaches one much. It
was easy to read the lines of dissipa
tion, of evil indulgence, that marked
the white face before him; but the
padre saw further to the soul-sickness
beneath.
"We are Armenians. Signore," he
proffered, 'a community of students,
who have poor entertainment; but to
such as we have, the stranger is wel
come. He who comes to us stays
without question and fares forth again
at his own will."
As he spoke, a ball's clear, chilly ;
chime rose from somewhere within
the walls. At the note the padre
turned, bow^d his knee before the
leaden Virgin, and rising, with arm
raised toward the lagoon, blessed the
waters and the land, Then; he held
out his hand to Gordon.
"I am Padre Sukias Somalian," he
said. "I will go and inform the prior.
I will call you presently."
He disappeared through the wall
gate.
Gordons eyes, following him, saw
the worn motto deeply cut in the stone
above it.
" ( Â» bolitudo, holh Beatitudo."
Was it solitude that had brought
that look of utter peace to the friar's
fate. Or was it rather the belief that
made him bow before the niche yon
der?
His gure wandered back to the
shrine. Prayer to him was a. fetish â
a plastic rigmarole of symbols and for
mulae â the modern evolution of ihi
pre-Adamite, anthropomorphic suner- .
stition. It was far '.more man that to
the friar. He knelt each day to that
little leaden image. And before such '
an image she, Teresa, whose pure soul
had been wounded last night, had laid
that written petition. Â Â -
A singular look . stole to . his face,
half-quizzical, half- wistful. He took
a, leaf of paper from his pocket. 'â He :
hesitated a moment, folding and un- :
folding it. He glanced â  toward the
gate.
Then he went to the niche, stooped
and lifted one of ihe loose flat stones
that formed the base on which the
image rested. He brushed away the
sanr* with his hand, put the paper In
the space and replaced the stone over
it.
As hÂ« stood upright, a voice called
to him from the gate. It was the
padre, and he turned and followed him
in.
CHAPTKR XXXI.
At the rcet f Our I*ady of Sorrows.
George Gordon, at the -monastery of
San Lazzarro. looked out of washed
eyes upon an altered condition. He
conscious or new strength and
new we.n ki losses. The man, emerging
lrom the slough of those months of
lawless impulses and ungoverned
recklessnesses, had iound no gradual
rejuvenation. After weeks of remorse,
temptation had riung itself upon him
lull armed. The memory of a prayer
had vanquished it. In that Instant of
moral resistance conscience had been
reborn. It was the sharp sword di
viding forever past from present. The
past of debauchery was henceforth
impossible to him. What future was
there? He had hot only to bear un
numbed the despair he had tried to
drown, but an anguish born of the
newer yesterday.
The wholesome life of the friars,
their homely occupations and studies,
varied by little more than matutinal
visit* of flshboats of the lagoon, aided
him Insensibly. His thought needed
something craggy tv break upon and
he found it in tfte Armenian language
which he studied under the tutelage
of Padre Somalian. aiding the friar in
turning Into its rugged structure the
sonorous periods or "Paradise Lost."
Jiut trom time to time, in this rou
tine, a searing memory" would recur
and he would see in shifting chiaros
curo the ecenfc on the Piazza San
Marco; the faces of the maskers, the
slight, shrinking torm of Teresa, the
angry dark eyes of the Fornarina, a
hand snatching at a veil â then the
streaming moonlight tangling to a
halo about a girl's shocked toce so in
nocently touched with horror, a face
that would always be distinct to him:
It he could have spared her the in
dignity of that one coarse scene! If
he could only ha\vÂ» toid her himself,
and gently! But even that. Fate had
denied him â the dogging Nemesis
that stalked him always! But for its
decree they had not met that night.
He would have remained in her mind
as she had seen him by the side of
little Pasquale â a kindly shadow, a
mystery beckoning her sympathy,
then haply forrot. Now she would
remember him always. Not as the
wretched and misunderstood being for
whom she had prayed at La Mira, but
with shrinking and self-reproach, as
a veritable agency of cvil â the true
milord malingo. who had bought her
interest with the spurious coin of hy
pocrisy. So his tormented thought
raced out along the barren grooves of
surmise.
As he walked under the orchard's
rosy roof the prior called to him:
"A wedding party is coming to the
south landing," he said. "Our mon
astery i 6 fortunate this mouth. This
is the third."
Gordon looked. There, rounding
the sea wall, was a procession
of gondolas, decked superbly, the
foremost draped wholly in white
and trailing bright streamers
in the water, like some great queen
bird leading a covey of soberer plum
age. By the richness of the banners
and embroidered tenda. it was the cor
tege of some noble bridal. As he grazed,
the faint music of stringed instruments
drifted across the walls.
Gathering closer the coarse brown
monastery robe he had thrown about
him, Gordon followed the padre
through the garden to the further en
trance, where the brethren, girdled and
cowled, were drawn up, a benign row.
The bride would wait among the ladles
on the beach, since beyond that portal
no woman's foot must go; the bride
groom would enter, to leave his gifts
and to drink a glass of home-pressed
vlolet-soented wine in the great hall.
Gordon paused a little way from the
water-stairs and looked down over the
low wall at the white gondola. One
day. he mused, Teresa would marry
some noble like this, no doubt, for she
had rank and station â one whom she
would love as she might have loved
him. Perhaps she would celebrate her
marriage in the Venetian way. come In
a gondola procession maybe to this
very monastery, never guessing that he
once had been within it! In what cor
ner of the world would he be then?
Under the edge of the tenda he could
see the shimmering wedding-gown of
the bride, cloth of gold heavy with
seed pearls. The gentlemen had already
entered the close. As he gazed, the
gondola ewung round and he caught a
fleeting glimpse of her face.
"Teresa!" he gasped, and his hand
clutched the wall.
Sheâ so soon! A sudden oain. not
vague but definite, seized him. She
had not cared, then. Her heart had
not suffered, after all! On that night,
when she had swayed forward Into the
gondolier's arms, it had been only hor
ror at her discovery, not a nearer
grief! What for that quivering Instant
he had thought he read in her excla
mation had not been there. Fool! To
think his face could have drawn her
for an hour! Doubly fool to sorrow for
her hurt! Better so. She must not see
him; no reminder of- shame and affront
ehould mar this day for her.
He turned, crossed the garden,
opened the wall-gate and came out by
the niched shrine upon the shore path
which semicircled the monastery.
A gust of self-raillery shook him.
Inside, the friars were gravely drink
ing a health to the bride, in cups kept
burnished for the purpose, "made of
pure gold. He, though only a guest,
should be among them in robe and eir
dle to cheer these nuptials! He had
drunk* many a bumper in such costume
in the old New-stead- days, with Sheri
dan and Tom Moore!
The bitter laugh died on his lips.
Why should he remember so well? In
such a gabardine he had drunk the
toast Annabel had heardâ the niieht he
had asked her to marry him. And he
had drunk it from a death's-head! The
emblem, truly enough, had typified the
tragedy marriage was to be to him!
He leaned forward, restinj? his fore
head against the mossed stone, as if
it 6 coolness might allay the fever that
held him. Would marriage have meant
sÂ»uch for him if the words that had'
bound him tn Annabel Had linked him
to a heart like Teresa's: of fire and
snow, of simple faith, of tenderness and
charity? If he could have loved one
like her!
He had no knowledge of how long he
stood there. He was recalled by a
voice from the path behind him between
him and the gate, his only way of es
cape â a voice that held him spellbound.
"Father, give me your blessing!"
With an overmastering sense of the
fatality that had beckoned her to the
lagoon path at Just this moment to
mistake him for one of the padres, he
turned slowly. She was kneeling, the
exquisite fabric of her dress sweeping
the moist shingle, her eyes on the
ground, awaiting the sign.
He reached out his hand with a
hoarse cry:
"Not thaf! Teresa! It is Iâ lâ who
should kneel to you!"
The words broke from him at sight
of her bent face, not as a bride's should
be, but weary and listless. Underneath
the cry was a quick thrill of triumph.
Though she was that day another
man's wife, yet she had suffered! But
the thrill died in a pang of reproach.
If she did not care, better the harshest
thought of him now!
She had sprung to her feet in pas
sionate amaze.
"You!" she exclaimed; "ah, you!"
In the exclamation there was a great
revulsion and greater Joy. Her gaze
swept his pallid features, his costume
âher sick imagination had pictured
him in scenes of ribaldry, with evil
companions! She began to murmur
broken sentences:
"I have wronged you! That night
on the square â it was not the you that
I had known! You had tried to leave
that life behind â the past that had giv
en you that name! You are not what
they sayâ not now! Not now!"
He stopped her with a gesture.
"It is I who have wronged you," he
said in a voice hard from repression.
"Do not Judge me by this robe; It
means less than nothing. I am here
by the veriest accident. Not for pen
ance or shriving."
For an instant she recoiled. Instinct
groping in the maze of doubt. What
was he, erring angel or masquerading
evil? It was the question she had cried
to herself all this time, blindly, pas-
Blonately, her judgment all RBtrayâ
the query that silence had at last an
swered with the conviction in which
her long-planned marriage had seemed
as acceptable a fate as any. Now her
soul, wavering anew, spoke its agony
in a direct appeal:
"Tell me! tell me the truth!" she
pleaded plteously. "I have suffered so
since that night. I have not known â
how could I know?â what to think. I
believed -what you said at La Mira,
every word! And It is not your past
I think of now; it is only what you
were that very hour .and sinee â and
what you are to-day. Was it only a
play â to make me sorry? Did you
pretend it all?"
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL 1 .
"Teresa!" he entreated.
"You said that night that I must for
get we had ever met. Did that mear
Sfdg merely pitied and spared me? Thai
you are still to beâ all that Venict
says?"
"It was what I had been that
counted!"
"No, no!' 1 she protested. "Can't yoi
see that does rot matter to me now'
It Is pnly' what you were then th.it
counts to me! Your voice, your eyes
what you saidâ you made me care!
Was it all a He?"
He felt his heart contract at this visi
ble suffering whose root was so un
selfish a desire. His resolve crumbled
"Teresa," he said in a tone as
strained as her own, "whatever of cvi
I have done has not been since I havt
known you. You have waked some
thing in me that would not sleep again
It was this you saw and heard anc
felt. I could not hide it. It h*<
stayed with me ever since! It will al
ways be with me now whether I wifl
or no. I did come here by accident
But I have stayed because the past-
Venice and my life thereâ ls hateful tc
me! Tt has been co since that morn-
Ing at. La Mira!"
"Oh!" shQ, breathed, "then when yoi
asked me for the praterâyou did noi
â you meant â " -
"It was because it was almost the
only unselfish and unworldly thing 3
had ever known. Because it was t
thought for the scorned and unshrlven
because of the very hurt it gave; be-
cause it was a prayer of yoursâ for
me!"
While he er>oke a great gladness il
lumined her face. "Have you kept it?"
He turned from her instinctively to
the shrine, his hand outstretched to
raise the fiat stone. But as suddenly
he paused. He had placed it there In
a half-sardonic mockery; not with the
pure faith she would Infer from the ac
tion. He could not stand In a false
light before her.
He let the stone fall back into its
place.
As he turned again to answer, he
confronted two figures coming through
the gateway a few paces off. One was
an old man, his bent form dressed
gaily. The other was Padre Somalian.
The latter, in advance, had alone seen
the lifted stone.
Both, however, saw the emotion in
the two faces before them. The padre
stood still; the other sprang forward,
his posture Instinct with an unhealthy
passion, his piercing eyes on the pair
with evil inquiry.
The attitude of ownership was un
mistakable. Gordon felt his veins clog
with Ice. This senile magntfico Ter
esa's husband! Thisâ a coerced Vene
tian mating of name, of rank, of lands
aloneâ for her? The sight smote him
painfully, yet with a strange, bitter
comfort.
There was even more in the old
noble's look than Gordon guessed;
more than anger at her presence here,
this young bride of his, apart from the
gondolas. He had recognized the man
in the monk's robe. His voice rose in
a snarl:
"Unbaptlzed son of a dog! What is
he doing on holy ground?" He point
ed his stick at Gordon. "The aban
doned of Venice! Has not his past
fame penetrated here. Padre, that you
lend him asylum? Call my gondoliers
and I will have him flung into the la
goon!"
The friar stood transfixed, shocked
and pained. Never since he had met
Gordon on that very spot at sunrise,
had he asked even his name. Suppose
the stranger were all the other said.
What difference should it make? The
fixed habit of the monk answered:
"What he has been is of no question
here."
The grandee sneered at the padre's
answer.
â¢"You left the gondola, to be sure, to
pray," he said to Teresa, then turned
to Gordon, who waited in constrained
quiet: "Wolf in sheep's clothing! Did
you come for the same purpose?"
Teresa felt In Oordon'a silence a con
trol that stilled her own violence
of feeling. Her husband saw her
glance and a maniacal suspicion darted
like lava through his brain. If this
meeting were planned* they had met
beforeâ she and this maligno whom hÂ«
had seen on the Piazza San Marco.
Two hectic spots sprang into his sal
low cheeks. A woman's veiled form
had stood by this man then! He re
membered the derisive story with
which the caffes had rung the next,
day. That same night the unlighted
gondola had crept through the water
gate Into the garden of the Palazzo
Albrizzl!
He leaped forward and gripped Te
resa's wrist with shaking fingers, as
the padre opened his mouth to speak.
He leaned and whispered words into
her earâ words that, beside himself as
he was; he did not choose that the friar
should hear.
The hazard told. Her color faded. A
startled look sped into her eyes. He
knew that she had met Gordon at night
on the square! She read monstrous
conclusions in the gaze that held her.
Innorent as that errand had been he
would never believe it! A terror struck
her cold. This old man who possessed
her, that instant ceased to be an ob
ject of tolerance and became an active
horror, baleful, secretive and cruel.
She stood still, trembling.
The padre had been nonplused at
the quick movement and Its result.
Gordon could not surmise what the
whispered words had boen, but at Te
resa's paleness he fait hie muscles grow
rigid.
To her accuser her agitation meant
one thing. He released her wrist with
. a cracked laugh, distempered Jealousy
convulsing his features. He hissed one
word at herâ "Want
The syllables wert live coals flung
upon her breast. She cried out and
put her hands to her ears as If to shut
out the Bound.
At that epithet and her cry Gordon's
countenance turned livid. His fingers
hardened to rteel. The air swam red.
But the girl divined; she sprang be
fore him and laid her fingers on his
arm. His hands dropped to his side;
he remembered suddenly that his an
tagonist was ag^d. decrepit. What had
he been about to do?
For one heart-beat Teresa held Gor
don's glance. When she faced her dis
traught husband, her eyes were like
blu-j-tempered metal. Those weeks of
baffled quest had been slipping the
leash of girlhood. That one word had
left her all a woman. Her lips "were set,
and resentment had drenched her
cheeks with vivid color.
"Signoiv," she said, "I would to God
it were still yesterday!"
She turned, and went proudly down
the path by which she had come.
The old man had not moved. Now
he raised his stick and struck Gordon
with it across the brow. A white
mark sprang where it fell, but the
other dtd not lift his hand. Then
Teresa's husband, with an impreca
tion, spat on the ground at the friar's
feet and followed her toward the gon
dolas.
The whole scene had been breath
less and fate-like. To the padre it
was a Hurry of hellish passions loosed
from the pit. The storm past, still
shocked from the violence of Its im
past, his mind wrestled with a doubt.
His first glance at the faces of the
man and the woman as he emerged
from the gate had been full of
suggestion. They had not. seemed
to spell guilt, yet could be
tell? What had been the husband's
whispered charge? Was the bearing
of the woman, which seemed to mirror
innocence, really one of guile? The
man here before him, accused of what
specious crime he could only guess!
Why had he come to the monastery?
Had there been, indeed, more than
chance in this encounter at the
shrine?
He looked at Gordon, but the latter,
staring out with a gaze viewless and
set across the lagoon, seemed un
conscious of the scrutiny. "Be not
forgetful to entertain strangers!" That
had been the monastery's creed. Aye,
but if it should be entertaining an
angel of evil unawares? He thought
of the lifted stone â the man's hand
had just dropped it back into place
at his approach. He remembered that
when he called Gordon from the gate
on the morning of his coming he had
seen him bending over the shrine. The
fact seemed to discloÃe significance.
Had this stranger used this holy em
blem to further a clandestine and sin
ful tryst? Had he hidden an endear
ing message there for the wife to find
to-day if he should be observed?
Lines of sternness sharpened the
friar's features. He strode forward,
caught up the stone and lifted the
folded paper.
The sternness smoothed out as he
read the simple penned sentences, and
a singular took crept to his face. It
vtas more than contrition; it w;is the
self-accusatory sorrow of a mind to
whom uncharity is a heinous sin be
fore high heaven.
He turned, flushing painfully. Gor
don's back was still toward him.
Then the padre laid the paper
gently back in its place, reset the
stone over it, and silently, with bowed
head, entered the sate.
That night there were two who did
not close eye In the monastery of Ban
Lazzarro. One was Padre Somalian.
who prayed in penance. Th* other
was ft stranger who walked the floor
of his chamber, the prey to an over
mastering emotion.
That scene on the path, like a light
ning flash in a dark night, had shown
Gordon his own heart. He knew now
that a force stronger even tharr his de
spair had been at work in him without
his knowledge. A woman** face cried
tp him beyond all gainsaying. Teresa's
voice sounded In every lurch of wind
against the sea-wall â in every wave
that beat like a passing bell upon the
margin-stones.
Far. far deeper than the burn of
the white welt on his forehead
throbbed and thrilled a bitter-sweet
misery. In spite of his desire he had
brought shame and agony upon her^â
and whether for good or ill, he loved
her.

as ghostly -arid as gray, all its miracle
hues gone lack-luster, its glories palled,
its whole face pallid and corpse-like.
-,". In the old monastery of 'San Lazzar
ro, in the bare whitewashed room used
as a library, with wide windows front
ing the sea, Gordon sat bending over a
table. He had been trying to write, but
could not for the thoughts that flocked
between him and the "paper. "
They were thoughts of Teresa, of
v.'hat ; he had innocently brought upon
her. -To save her .pain he would him
self - have gone through immeasurable
miseries, but no pang .of his could
lighten hers, or ward the jealous fury
that might sting and embitter- her life.
Where . "was sne? Behind" some cold
palazao walls â¢of Venice, â¢ Buffering
through him? â¢ He knew not even her
name now. Should they â â  never meet
again? : >
She loved him. When and '_ how she
had ; 1 crossed '? â  that C indistinguishable
frontier mattered nothing. The fact
remained. When had he ever been
loved ; before, he . thought. Not Lady
Caroline Lamb;: hers was an aberrant
fancy, an â 'â  orchid bred of a hothouse
life in London. Not Annabel, his wife;
she had loved the commiseration of her
world more than she loved him. Not
Jane Clermont â he shuddered as he,
thought of 1 her. ;-. For. he knew that , not
for one .ephemeral = moment A .of. that
reckless companionship had a real love
furnished' extenuation. â  - :
"Now," he told himself, "I. .who could
not love when I might, may not when
1 can. Yet. in â¢ spite- of the black past
that bars my lift from such as Teresa's
â I love her! In- spite of allâ though for
both of us it i 3 an impossible condi
tion, impossible then since I was
chained to a marriage in England,
doubly Impossible now . since she is
bound by a marriage here. I love her
and she loves me! And our love can be
only what the waves of ' hell were to
Tantalus!" -
He struck the littered sheets of pa
per with his hand, as a heavier gust of
wet wind rattled the , casement. 'Dark
ness and despair!" he said aloud. "That
is all my pen can paint now!"
A door opened and Padre Somalian
entered.
The friar surveyed the scene of tem
pest . from the , window a moment in si
lence; then approached the table and
sat down. '-"
"You are at work, my son?" he in
quired in English. ~ .
. The tope was mild as a child's. Since
his penance after that scene Iby the
shrine the eye of the padre had seen
truer. But he had asked the man be
fore him nothing. â 
"Only idle verses, padre."
"Why idle?" â¢
"Because they cannot express what I
would have them."; . -
The friar pondered, his fingers laced
in his beard. To-day, 'in the dreariness
of the elemental ; turmoil without, >he
longed intensely to touch some chord in
. this lonely man ' that would vibrate to
confidence. \' . . ;_; _ ' .
. "What would you s have them ex
press?" he asked at length. '
"A dream of mine last night, padre."
' .'i'A dream! Dreams were but the reflex
of the waking mind. The friar felt
suddenly nearer his goal.
, "Will you tell it to me, my son?" ' .
Gordon rose, went to the window and
looked out as the other had done. ; His
: face was still turned seaward as he be
.gan: â¢" , vâ  - â¢ 1." . ' : '"â  ".''.- ..!

pause. "It is only :in â  the human heart.

"Morning came," - went on Gordon;

men.' , â¢ .',' â¢ â¢ . â¢,Â» .--. ;"- * '
â¢ Padre Somalian said no more. He
left the room slowly."
The man standing by the window
had" made no reply. In the old day 3he
would have V smiled. Now his- brow
frowned haggardly. The age-old an
swer of the churchman! To what mul
titudinous human miseries it had prof
fered comfort! The sinless suffering
and its promise. What an unostenta
tiously beautiful beliefâ if it were only
true. If it were only true!
"What an advantage," he thought,
"its possession gives the padre here'?
If it is true, he will have his reward
hereafter; if there la no hereafter, he
at the worst can be but with the infidel
in his eternal sleep, having had the as
sistance of an exalted hope through
life without subsequent .disappoint
ment. I have no horror of the awak
ening. In the midst of myriads of liv
ing and dead creations, why should I
be anxious about an atom? It will not
please the great T that sowed the
star, clusters to damn me for an unbe
lief I cannot help, to a worse perdition
than that I walk through nowâ and
shall walk through as long as I live!"
He spoke the last phrase half aloud.
As long as I live.". Why should it be
for long? Hereâ despair: there â no
worse, if not a dreamless sleep! ' - -
"Why not?" he said to himself with
grim humor. "I should many a good
day have blown my brains out but
for the recollection that it would
pleasure Lady Noel â and even then if
I could have been certain to haunt
her!"
He turned and threw the window
open and a scurry of rainy wttvl
whirled the sheets of paper about the
floor. He looked out and down. ! On
that side of the island the beach had
been only a narrow weedy ribbon
soaked by every storm. Now the. wind
that had, driven the sea into the pent
lagoon had piled it deep In the turbid
shallows and the wall 'â¢ f ell â 'â  sheer â¢ info

glasses, for the scorching desert
sun had heated the gold rims to
an uncomfortable degree. When
lie had located them more agreeably
on nose and ear the lenses were, so
out of place that the shimmering
sands danced from vision altogether.
Then the tenderfoot brought his pony,
** rather savagely, to a stand and made
a second adjustment.
The desert came back and the young
man took advantage of the halt to
look about to assure himself he was
on the right way. Three months at thÂ«
mission had made him familiar with
â¢the beaten paths for many miles about,
but this unmarked way was new. An
Indian had directed him with _ many
waving! of the arms, explainingin the
Eign language that the white man
could reach the mission while the sun
was ac high as the highest of the San
Francisco Mountains would he go this
*r direction, while to take tlie regular
<r trail would keep him from home until
long after the fun had set.
To the left lay the cinder cone he
knew well. Off yonder were the San
Francisco Mountains; the river and
the mission must be straight ahead.
"One look he cast behind to locate the
familiar lava mountains that thrust
themselves above the horizon of pur
ple mesa, sand and rock, and half a
mile away he saw an Indian galloping
toward him and motioning wildly. The
tenderfoot turned his horse and went
to meet him.
His heart gave a thrill of fear when
he recognized the Indian as the big
medicine man from Yellow Burro
Spring. He was not afraid of the In
dians he met usually, but this medi
cine man was a bitter enemy of the
missionaries who were teaching \ his
people that his ceremonies were worse
than useless. He hart brought down
on their heads all t , choice curses
of the Navrfjo tongue. ihe gentle wife
of the missionary had but recently
cured a woman this medicine man was
singing to death, and the tenderfoot
knew he would never forgive her.
Alone on the desert with the big
â chief, the white man of. 22 reined his
pony beside the Indian's and saluted
him in curious Xavajo. He knew some
of the tongue and the Indian knew a
few words of English. What was not
understood by use of bits of two lan
guages the Indian made plain with elo
quent gestures.
The medicine man's litle boy was ill
and the father had come for help from
the mission. He wanted the tenderfoot
to turn back with him to Yellow Burro
and he pointed to his pony's heaving
sides and trembling legs as reason
enough why they should not add an ex
tra ten miles to their" journey. The
tenderfoot tried to explain that he had
no medicines and knew nothing of them
even if he had,' but the Indian either
â¢ , could or would not understand. Fear
nj . ing to displease, yet little knowing
â what he would do when he reached the
sick child, the tenderfoot spurred " his
boree toward Yellow Burro.
It was twenty miles over the desert
to the spring and the tenderfoot did
a deal of "thinking on the way. It came
to him that there would be prayers of
Â» thanksgiving at the mission when the <
folk there were told that the big medi
cine man had acknowledged his sing

"Grinding out copy," as they call it

Toryâif the child's life could be saved.
It not â the tenderfoot removed his
sombrero and felt carefully of his
scalp.
AH his plans were laid before the
hogan was reached. He would send
back fur the missionary's wife, who had
a wonderful way of fetching sick In
dians back to health with her simple
medicines and gentle prayers. She
would come and all would be well.
The Indian's pony had been ridden
hard â his master had spared neither
quirt nor heel and the distance was
telling on him. A few miles from Yel-
I. w Uurro the horse fell, the rider
dropping on his feet like a cat, and
without one glance at the dying ani
mal, swung swiftly into stride beside
the tenderfooUs pony.
The medicine man had grown sons
and daughters, but the child that lay
dying: at his hogan was the son of his
new wife â a mere girl when he had
bought her three years before. She had
spent part of two years at the white
men's school at th-? canyon before her
father had received many horses and
sheep for her. She remembered the
Knglish she had learned and the re
finements of civilization had appealed
t'i her woman's heart, but it was easy
to drop back to the old life again.
Above all else the medicine man
loved the little brown papoose that had
come to him. The woman who under
stood crow talk said that the black
birds had told her that the boy, if he
grew to manhood, would drive the
white people from the desert's edge and
lead his people to green pastures and
flowing brooks. "But he may not live,"
added the trow woman, slowly shak
ing her lowered head; "the crows say
he may not live."
So the boy fell ill and for nine days
the wild dances and songs of the
medicine man had gone on, and at the
end the boy lay still with his little
body burning inside and out. The crow
woman looked upon him and mut
tered: â¢"The crows say a white man
shall cure him."
And so the great shaman rode toward
the mission and brought back the ten
derfoot to work a miracle.
The white youth adjusted his glasses
and knelt beside the baby that was
wrapped tightly to a board by strips
of rags. Somewhere in his brain was
the thought that . a change was good
for a sick person. Vaguely he remem
bered that, but he would act on it â
something must be done.
"I'll give this kid the change of his
life," he mused, and he ordered that
water be brought .and heated in Hopl
pottery and white man's tin. While it
was heating he scrawled a note to the
missionary setting forth the case. This
he gave to the shaman's wife and told
her to have it sent immediately to the
mission. But no one would take it;
night was on and the chee/idy would
be abroad.
"No go to-night," said the little
squaw. "Cheendy, cheendy."
The tenderfoot knew that to urge
would be useless, for the Navajo fears
the ghosts that walk in the dark more
than he loves his child-
Removing his shirts the tenderfoot
waved the soft undergarment in the
air and held it before the fire to warm
and dry it thoroughly.
"It isn't clean," he said half aloud,
"but it bea-ts anything th/ey have
here."
The water was warm and he removed
other, and the "Buster Brown con
ceits are examples where newspaper
stories amount to genius. But this is
away off from correspondence, that we
started out with.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The letters that a woman receives
run the gamut, from the most pathetic
to those that are so silly or aggravat
ing that one wonders at the nerve that
pens them.
While at the World's Fair I wrote up
the Aeousticon, the electrical contriv
ance that promises to do much for
those who are deaf. Letters poured in
from people all over the country, whose
friends had sent them copies of the
story. These letters were absolutely
pitiful, many of them appealing to my
very soul and asking if I really thought
the writers might be benefited. Every
letter of that nature reoeived is an
swered personally, and if any good re
sults the assurance that It had been in
my power to help one so afflicted would
be most grateful to me.
Again, a story will fit exactly some
the rags from the child and bathed
him gently. With part of the shirt he
dried the little body and wrapped it in
the remainder. Then he poured a lit
tle cool water down h!s throat and car
ried him into the hogan, for the chill
of the desert night was coming on.
The medicine man, who had watched
all this in silence, followed into the ho
gan and picked up a repeating rifle of
ancient model- Squatting on the floor
he pumped half a dozen cartridges
from the magazine, examineJ them
carefully and replaced them, looking
from time to time from the tenderfoot
to the child.
The tenderfoot understood and fear
parched his throat and sent the blood
in sickening bounds through his body.
A few Indians were standing in front
of the hogan around the fire they kept
burning brightly to keep off the cheen
dy. The crow woman, who had sat a
little apart from the others, arose,
crept forward and thrust her head into
the low door of the hogan. The sha
man cursed her and she fled hastily to
the fire. Fearing her crow prophecies,
he hated her.
The trembling squaw squatted oppo
site the tenderfoot beside her child, who
was sleeping, his body refreshed by one
of the few baths of his life. After a bit
the tenderfoot arose, his courage back,
crossed near to where the shaman sat
and knocked out a chunk of mud from
the hogan side to let in fresh air.
A feverish little cry from the child
sent him out hastily to the fire for hot
water. This he mixed with a few drops
of goat's milk, and with the aid of the
mother got some of the mixture down
the child's throat. Quiet came again,
and the tenderfoot, as feverish as the
child, sought the cool of the night out
side the hogan.
Beside the fire sat the crow woman
aud three other Indians. The white
man turned from them toward the cor
ral where horses were kept. A move
ment at the fire caused him to turn, and
he saw the shaman watching him, rifle
in hand. Endeavoring not to show fear,
he sauntered back toward the hogan.
In his ears rang the simple prayers of
f>articular case, and a letter will come
actually "hurrahing" for me and tell
ing me to "whoop 'em up," adding that
it was the best thing I ever wrote, and
the evident satisfaction will make me
feel real good to know that some one
liked It-
Another will write, criticizing with
brutal frankness any cuts of my un
fortunate self. One will praise them
extravagantly and another will be cyn
ical and tell you so candidly what they
think of you that all the conceit is ta
ken out of you in a solid lump. Such
letters are too funny for anything. It is
so queer to see yourself as others see
you.

Letters begging for your photo also
come in good share.
After my Nan Patterson story five
letters from eminent specialists asked

asking if I thought she were guilty.
Two noted criminologists also wrote

the missionary's wife â prayers he could
not voice. "O ye of little faith," he
whispered, and his brain ran wild with
plans of escape â plans he knew were
impracticable under the watchful eyea
of the Indians.
The shaman and the crow woman
talked together earnestly, and then the
former re-entered the hogan. Soon the
little squaw came out and touched the
tenderfoot on the arm. "He say you
cure him boy," she said, and then her
voice died Into a whisper, "you cure or
he kill."
Understanding fully, the tenderfoot
swung toward the corral, but four In
dians were watching from the fire and
the glow of the coals danced on some
thing metallic just within the hogan.
Together he and the squaw returned
to the child.
Long they watched through the night
beside the papoose, and the sleepless
shaman watched the three. Toward
morning the child's breathing became
less and less regular. The tenderfoot
felt of the little body; the fever was
gono and it was trembling with the
chill that followed. The lungs were be
ginning to fill and the breath was com
ing: in painful gurgles.
The medicine man had seen other
children die and he hastened out to
consult the crow woman. In broken
English the wife whispered that the
crow woman was urging the white
man's death, saying that the crows
had promised to save the child if the
man were sacrificed.
The tenderfoot heard, but he did not
heed, for he was watching the dying
convulsions of the little one. When
the mother saw she caught her baby to
her breast and with a wall for the
dead rushed out of the hogan. The
shaman heard the cry for the dead,
he saw the limp body of the child, and
grief and anger controlled him. Above
grief and anger surged that keenest
of emotions, remorse. Had he not
listened to the crow womanâ lying
prophet that she was â the boy would
yet have been alive. All his bitter
ness centered for an instant on her â
and she was beside him. His rifle

them one would have thought me the

Another set of letters, presumably
written by men, wanted to know if I
"were a woman or a man," and the
funny reasons they would give for sus
pecting me c-f being a man would make
a wooden Indian grin.
The women write me long letters
about their domestic woes, asking ad
vice as to the adjustment of matrimo
nial obliquities. Now, unless one be
hunting for trouble, it is wisest never
to give advice of that kind. Women also
write me, asking me to find them good
husbands, and men ask for wives. They
certainly want lots for their money,
don't you think? Married women write
me of their troubles, asking me to
write on a given subject, hitting it
hard, so that they can read it to hub
by. Scores of young girls write me as
to how they can get into newspaper
work and stage-struck girls ask me to
get them engagements.
One man wrote me that he remem
bered me ever since I was a daring lit
stock flashed above his head in the sun
rays that had just topped the distant
mesa and swung down as swift as the
Hash it let out. The crow woman
dropped in a heap on tho sand, her
body jerking with the muscles that
tightened and relaxed, tightened and
relaxed. Over her quivering body the
shaman bent, his voice mingling wildly
with the cry of the little mother.
Then he remembered the white man
who had brought this woeful thing
to pass, and he whirled toward the
hopan entrance, calling aloud to him
within, cursing him with all the curses
of the Navajo tongue. He threw his
rifle down and drew a knife from his
belt. "Bears eat you! Snakes bite
you! Cheendy take you!" he cursed,
and he rushed Into the hogan to kill.
The place was empty.
"O ye of little faith," kept ringing
in the tenderfoot's ear as he urged his
horse over the desert. "The mission
ary's wife would not have run away,
'ye of little faith,' the missionary's
wife .would not have run away."

of exposure after the long run of the
day before and the prospects of a
thirty-mile ride bareback to the mis
sion did not arouse enthusiasm in the
tenderfoot. Already he was wonder-
Ing how he would be able to face the

were unafraid. What excuse could he
give for running away, what excuse for
helping to undo, through his cowardice,
their years of toil?
He had not stopped to saddle, but had
caught up the long rope that trailed
from the horse's neck, put a noose over
its nose and mounted. The Indian had

The sun was overhead when the cot
tonwoods along the Little Colorado
came in sight. The white man's horse
was gasping for breath through
parched nostrils and his muscles were
working in jerks. His feet dragged in
the cand and he stumbled and swayed
as he ran. Not two hundred yards be
hind, the Indian rode, calm and deter
mined. His gain had been slow but
constant.
Somewhere across the river among
the cottonwoods was the mission where
the tenderfoot would be safe among
friendly Indians and with the brave
missionary and his wife. He was fifty
yards from the steep bank that led.
down to the river, when the Indian
tired. The tenderfoot wondered why
he had missed. At the bank he felt a.
great blow on his head and h^e knew
only that he was clinging to his horse's
mane and going down, down. down.
In the silt- laden river the horse
stopped suddenly, burring with thirst,
and thrust his nose into the water.

bringing full consciousness, and* hi*

Down the river bank rushed the In
dian pony, following the tracks of the
tenderfoot.. The white man was out of
sight and the Indian was urging hia
jaded animal. Into the stream the pony
staggered. In an instant the water was
at the saddle cinch and the horse reared,
plunged and fell on his side. Horse and
rider disappeared under the yellow
water: then the man's head came out
and he struggled at his lesr to free it
from the stirrup under the horse's
body. The animal's drowning struggles
dragged them lower and lower. They
were both gone; then for an instant ona
brown hand clutched at nothing above*
the slimy water and was Jerked sud

The struggles in the water ceased
and the ripples ran to the shore. The
shadow of a crow fell over the boy's
face and swept across the river.
"Quicksand!" shrieked the tenderfoot,
biting the blood from his fingers In his
terror.

"It isn't an easy thing to get a Grand

"It's funny how men will act on a
jury. We had one matter before that
Grand Jury o* three years ago in
which the evidence was conclusive. We
thought we had our twelve votes to
put it throygh. and I was never mor*
surprised than when one man upon
whom we counted â a man of prom
inence nnd not one of the stuffersâre
fused to vote to indict the man in
volved.
" 'I'm not going to vote against him,*
he told me. 'I don't like to, and be
sides it is against my own interests to
do it. fHe is a customer of mine; hia
patronage mjeans several thousand dol

cotne to me about him. I'll lose his cus
tom if I vote against him, and I can't
afford it and won't do it. What does
it matter, anyhow?'
"Now, this man is a representative
âa fairly representative citizen, and
his attitude is not an unusual attitude
by any means. He is only human.
"I didn't want to go up against any
thing like that with this Grand Jury.
"I had made up my mind if my name
was called that I wanted to be the
foreman. There were certain things
the Grand Jury ought to do, and I
wanted to do them.

"Because the administration is rot

â¢ "One of the inter
esting -things about
this Grand Jury is
that a peculiar con
diticn of affairs ex
isted w hen it came to
be drawn. Tho last

Grand Jury that
Would stir up things
jirid or II attention to
the rottenness wasn't
wanltd. That might
have interlered with
re-election â and
things were too good
to let go of them.
So the jury was
stuffed with the
friends of the admin
istration and every
thing was quiet. But
the need of that time
drew practically all
their friends for that
Jury, and when it â 
came to drawing this
one \ there/ weren't
very many of the ad
ministration support
. ers left over for use.
That was Just luck. The thirty names " â 
were drawn and the nineteen jurors
were carefully selected, and I was made
foreman. That wasn't Just luck. I owe
a good deal to Judge Kerrigan's back
ing. There were those who didn't want
me to be named foreman, but Judge
Kerrigan stood by me. '
"And then?"
"Then? Oh. then I got to work. The
jury was sworn in at 11 o'clock in thÂ»
morning â that was on the 10th of De
cember â and at 2:30 that afternoon I
had made my combinations."
"Thi3 way: You see, the Grand Jury
rooms are out in the City Hall, way out
on Market street, and the grand jurors
are business men and busy men. and
they can't afford to let their own af
fairs go entirely in order to attend
Grand Jury meetings. If the Grand
Jury is going to do anything the mem
bers have to get together, so I suggest.
Ed having these offices down town, for
there was about as much chance of do
ing anything in those rooms out in the
City Hall as of getting a quorum or
Twin Peaks every day. I made a state
itnent that the Grand Jury would hav-->
a great many matters to take up and
expected to do a good many things and
that a good deal of money would be
needed to do them, and made a demand
on the city government for $10,000. I
didn't expect to get it, and I didn't gÂ«t
It. But that cleared the way for the
next move. I called a conference ~f
business men, men interested In the
city, and told them what I thought the
Grand Jury could do and a3ked them
to back me. and they gave me their
promises to do It to the extent of $35.
000 if I needed that. One man offered
me his check for $1000 for a secret ser-
vice fund, but I didn't take itâ l onl^^
wanted the assurance that they'd back^
me. Then I went ahead. I hired thee*
offices," waving a hand to the Mills
building suite, "and furnished them on
the assurance.
"I went to the manager of on* firm
for the desks and furniture we needed,
told him what I wanted to do and
asked him what he would sell me the
things fkari He said he'd grve them to
me to use as long as the Grand Jury
needed them and wouldn't charge a
cent. An arrangement was made to
pay a rental for themâ but that Is the
spirit we met. not only in the man with
the office furniture, and the man with
the SIOOO check, and the men who were
willing? to put up $25,000 for us, but In
the whole decent element.
"There's been no limit to the help
and encouragement we've had. No re
sults can show the amount of work
we've had to do por the rang*
we've had to cover in making In
vestigations. They've extended to the
Eastern cities, and half a dozen States,
and the co-operation we've- had shova
pretty clearly what the feeling toward
us is. Well, the result is that It has
been decided to allow the Grand Jury
$1000 v munth."
The Grand Jury foreman folded his
arrr>3 and hugged himself, and allowed
himself a quiet little chuckle.
"But the co-operation we've had has
been nothing compared to the opposi
tion: perhaps it's truer to call it the
persecution. I suppose the enemies of
gra't are bound to make enemtes of
the grai'ters â that's only natural, of
course.
"Thp attempt has been made to dls

glee in his eyes that suggests a latent
(or is it a holdover?) boyishness, "and
I try to be impartial, to be square with
'cm all, you know."
"They tried to get the best of me
again, to do the Grand Jury up through

"I have to go to all sorts of places

far-reaching, and In order to escape
the spies at my heels and throw them
off my track I have had to go through
front dooA and out back doors and
across alleys and up and down back
stairs, out of windows and across
roofs. The queerest thing I've had to
do yet was in getting evidence in an
important case. I had to make a visit
to a place which must not be connected
with the case, and in order to do it and
lose the careful attendant at my heels
I had to send a man out to decoy him
away in one direction while I came
down the fire escape and got away in

"You must be almost harassed to
death," I volunteered, sympathetically.
"Harassed!" he hugged himself again
just breath enough to tell him
that- I want in that big a hurry.
Well, he got down under her again and
tightened her tonsils.
"When he came out this time he
looked like a screech owl with his
feathers singed off with hot lard. He
didn't say a word. He got in and
touched a nerve and the thing struck
the fence. I looked around to find my
friend, but I couldn't see him. All I

me. There isn't an act In my life I'm

man, like other menâ BUT I'M
CI.KAN."
Mere print can't tell you how he
said it. There's no kind of type that
can convey the ring of his voice â quiet,
tense, convincing.
He doesn't stand on his dignity. I
couldn't make out whether he set much
store by it or not; but I do know he
stands on his integrity. The word
that warms his heart is the word that
credits his honesty. It 1b the pearl of
price to him.
"You know in those poolroom cases
the men were sore, of course: a man's
always sore about losing. Well," and
the laughing wrinkles clustered at the
corners of his eyes, "that fellow Zick
AbramÃ, when he came out of the
courtroom, said: 'I don't know any
thing about those other fellers, one
way or the other, but you can bet the
little feller' (he meant me) 'is all right;
he's square; you can't do any business
with him.' "
He told it to me with a glow, and
in the same breath told me how a man
came to him and advised him to be
the road, over in the next county. I
said somethin' about the hog. but the
wind blowed my words aw& y as fast
as I uttered them, and the next mo

" 'Keep among the hogs, but look

says I. He twisted her under the
jaw till I could see her back teeth, but
she kept on goin" just the same. I
take it that the bull had led a sort of
humored life and thought he owned
the road. He must have taken the
premium at the county fair. I heard
him a-hummin' of his tune as he came
along. He put me in mind of a feller
I heard a-singin* In one of these operys
a long time ago. You could understand
what one said Just as well as the other.
"I told my friend that if he would
slack up to about seventy-five miles an

upper lip of the thing, but she wouldn't
give in. The bullâ well, \ was In
hopes that he would see us and
recognize the fact that we were

more politic, less outspoken, and asked
of me and the world at large, "What

long as I'm square."
There isn't a man of simpler man
ners, or life, or history, or tastes, in
all of San Francisco than this fore
man of the Grand Jury who has made
it possible for a Grand Jury to do
things no other Grand Jury ever did
before In this long-suffering city.
He is a little man. His nose comes
on the same level with mine, which
gives him five feet four inches of
height. For the sake of hero-wor
shipers I would like to make it five
feet six at the very least, but only
his hat can do that. He is lean and
wiry and nervous, with a clean, strong
line of Jaw, a delicate thin-lipped
mouth under a straight cut mustache,
sensitive nostrils, with the curve of
courage; wide open, limpid brown eyes,
well apart, with a glance as clear as a
child's; a high, delicately white brow,
in which the network of veins on the
temples swell and subside with chang
ing emotions. It is the face of cour
age and quick intelligence, candor and
ready sympathy.
His dress is characteristic â careful,
neat, quiet, unobtrusive; black, because
black, I surmise, takes less time to
choose at the tailor's than bewildering

the side of the road, a-wonderin 1 if I

around. I krrÂ«w that my friend must
be dead. But, bless your life, he was
under that machine with his monkey
â wrench. The bull? Well, he was gnin'
on up the road on three legs and with
only one horn. My friend came out
f>om under the machine and says to
me, Well. hoD in."
'â¢ "Thank you, I ain't a frog, and
know when I've hopped enough,'
says I.
' What, don't you want to ride?'
â¢' Well, not In a. combination of a
tnort wagon and a balloon.'
' Why, this la nothin",' says he. 'This
is one of my good days.'
"I told him it was good day so far
as I was concerned. He begged me to
get in, but I told him no; and I climbed
up a leanin' tree till he got started,
don't know whether the thing jumped
the fence or knocked it down, but any
how it started across the field. It
struck a stump and he went up Into
the air, but he came down with the
monkey wrench in his hand. No, that
sort of travelin' don't suit me. It's a
nightmare in the daytime. I may be
old-fashioned, but I am not a bull
fighter. I don't want to live in grease

the smile of one who relieves himself

Marshall surveyed "his new ac

a black diagonal suit, the whole sur

work of fine lines; beneath his ill

leather shoes marked with a white
Bubetante suggestive of salt water;

He rmlled a high stool toward Web
ster, who seated himself on the ex
treme edge with his heels on the sec
ond rung, in an attitude of merely pro
visional comfort, while Marshall joined
. the groups at the tank. When " that
approximate degree of cleanliness of
brushes and person which is allowed
to pa.ES muster in the Latin Quarter
was reached. Marshall conducted his
protege to the street.
Webster turned at the door and
looked back. "It does seem strange to
get here at last." he said, "I've been
waiting and waiting so long to do it."
"Is it all like what you expected?"
asked Marshall.
â x "Why, no. not exactly," replied the
i other. "But then I'm all mixed 'up.
Did you say it was 12, o'clock? It
seems to me like afternoon."
s l Marshall entered one of the smaller
restaurants en the boulevard. He or
dered luncheon and while it was be
ing cs. ten gathered some knowledge of
his companion.
Webster knew no French and had an
fm:ncnFc fear of spending more than
he ought. His helpless state had in
spired the pity of some of his fellow
passengers en the steamer, and, act
ing, on their .'<lvice. he had come
Ftraight to Jul>n. trusting to the
Providence which cares for his class;
Ho cast the .'burden of E all bis arrange

good humor of the Bohemian: and it
was not until late in the .' afternoon,
when he had established Webster at a
small not el and introduced : him at the
<iub. that he returned to his own: af
lairs.
"I am sorry I have to leave you." he
said, "for I am going to the country
for my vacation. , to-morrow; â¢_ but 'I

The months had run round from
Homeward Bound
summer to autumn before Marshall
ag-ain entered the atelier of the Acade
mic Julien. All was noise and con
fusion, several models were posing at
once, and the room was so filled with
easels that, seen from a little distance,
they resembled masts in a crowded
harbor.
At the noon r^st Marshall heard a
small voice beside him saying, "How
are you?" He looked round and per
ceived his former protege. If he had
seemed small and slight before, he
was now much more so. His hair
was longer and more unkempt and
he were a vile pair of soiled corduroy
trousers. There was the same depre
cating look about him, and his eyes
were larger and more bright.
Marshall greeted him cordially and
asked to see his work. Webster then
directed his attention to an easel bear
ing a lar^e canvas, and Marshall
crossed the room and looked over the
work in silence. The poor youth
plainly belonged to that class of stu
dents to whom advice and assistance
are impossible, whose masters after a
few efforts leave them to their own
devices. His study was in color and
on a large scale, painted with an at
tempt at extreme finish of detail
which gave greater absurdity to the
faults of modeling and proportion.
"I find a week a very short time in
which to complete a study," Webster
said. "I shall not be able to finish
this. I'm afraid, for I have a good deal
to change. I have introduced a land
scape background, but the professor
did not seem greatly to fancy Jt; so I
have changed it, as I think a student
should always be guided by his in
structor. There is no use in being in
his hands if you have no confidence
in his Judgment. Don't you think so?"
"Certainly, certainly," agreed Mar
shall, ar.d fled.
The winter months wore on. and in
the hurry of the short days work was
the first cc-nsideration, and Marshall
had no leisure to follow up Webster.
Still, he saw him at the atelier almost
daily. In fact, it seemed as if Webster
took pains to keep himself so far in
evidence, but he never aimed at more
than a word or two of greeting or re
mark about current -events.
March was upon them, and the days
were lengthening fast when, as Mar
shall was approaching the atelier one
morning, he saw Webster standing at
the gateway.
A prophetic instinct told ' Marshall
that something troublesome was about
to happen, and he felt instantly that
he had anticipated it from the first.
He waved his hand, however, and
called out his cheerful "How are you?"
at tome distance, quickening his pace
at the same time. Webster met him
with evident embarrassment, and said
at e-.ice:
"Oould you come to my place this
afternoon? I would take it very kindly
of you. I want your opinion of some
thing I've been doing."
"Of course I'll cc-me," said Marshall.
"Something for the Salon, I presume?"
"Why, yes," assented Webster. "It's
a matter of some importance to me,
and there is no one I would care to ask
except youâ no one I know so well.
11l expect ycui there about 3 if that is
convenient; No. 20, Rue Dauphine."
"Very well," answered Marshall, and
they turned into the atelier.
The Rue Dauphine is an obscure lit
tle btreet, the houses of which have.
for the most part, a second appearance,
and at one of the worst Marshall
stopped. As there was no sign of a
concierge Marshall, after a few mm
utes' hesitation, began to mount the
stairs. He had reached the first land
ing and was peering about him when a
door opened and Webster looked out.
"I was afraid you might miss the
place, so I was keeping a watch for
you," he explained, with his nervous
laugh. "This way, please."
Entering. Marshall found himself in
a room of the poorest description. The
floor was tiled and the tiles were damp
and broken; a small stove was burn
ing in one corner and a smell of cook
ing pervaded the place. A narrow
iron bed, covered with a coarse brown
blanket, ran along one side of the
room ; the window was large, but look
ing full to the north, admitted no ray
of sunshine, and a number of broken
chairs and a cheap table composed the
furniture. Marshall was too well
trained in the etiquette of Bohemia to
have any doubt as to what he should
do. He seated himself on the bed and
glanced about him.
"What a cozy place you have," he
remarked, with a smile â "cozy" being
a euphemistic expression applied in
Bohemia to any room which is small
and overheated.
"But where's the great work?" he
continued, glancing about him.
"I keep it next door, to be away
from the dust," said "Webster. "I'll
get it."
He disappeared and Marshall, with
a quick move of his hand, felt the
mattress. "Straw," he ejaculated, "and
eggshells In the coalhod â sure signs of
self-respecting poverty!"
The door opened and Webster re
turned bearing an unframed canvas.
In silence he placed it on a chair and
THE SAN FRANCISCO/ SUNDAY CALL.
then took his seat at the other end of
the bed, his eyes fixed on Marshall's
ffice. The picture was not really of
lyrge proportions! but seen under
these circumstances it appeared to fill
the room. It* was a stormy marine
piece, treated in a conventional man
ner and atrociously ill executed. In
the distance, outlined against a lurid
sunset, a black vessel was being beaten
apainst some rocks, in the foreground
the figure of a drowned mariner was
extended on the sand, while a number
of birds, which from their size could
only have been a flock of albatrosses,
were scattered about in various parts
or' the picture. The drawings were in
accurate throughout, the color dirty
and unnatural, the touch and execu
tion feeble and uncertain.
All this Marshall perceive^, at a
glance, but he continued to gaze, half
closing his eyes and making a tele
scope with his hand.
"I want you to be perfectly frank
with me," said Webster at last. "If
you think it can't possibly get in, I
want you to tell me so, and then, you
see, I needn't spend on my frame. So"
âhis voice shook a littleâ "l hope you'll
say just what you think." He paused
again a. moment. "The color has sunk
in some." ihe added wistfully. "It
will look better when it's varnished,"
and, bending forward, he rubbed the
canvas tenderly with his moistened
finger.
Marshall, meanwhile, was going
through an inward* debate. Would it
not be better to tell the truth court
eously but decisively? Would it not
be really the kindest thing to do? To
say anything else seemed Impossible.
His mouth was opening for his first
sentence when Webster, who had been
looking at the floor, began to speak
again with a hurried rush of words.
"I want to tell you," he said, "so you
can understand about it. I know I
haven't had much training, but I was
always very fond of art. I worked in
a photographer's place in Booneville.
I used to color the prints sometimes,
and I made some crayon portraits of
our prominent citizens, and so I saved
up someâ not much. There was a fel
low came through the town, he said
Paris was the nlace for art, and just
then my mother got a little money left
herâ her brother diedâ and she was just
wild for me to go to Paris for a year,
and so I came. Maybe it was selfish
of me, for I left my mother all alone,
and she's pretty old. but I sorter felt I
had to come. Now I'm here, I see the
great thing is to get into the Salon.
That man home said so, too.
'I went last year, and there did seem
to be some things not any better than
mine"â he looked up for the first time
â"and so I thought I'd try. I think
a man should have confidence in him
self," he added after a pause, clasp
ing and unclasping his thin hands ner
vously, "and I didn't mean to say any
thing to any one, but I've kinder lost
my grip. I guess I'm not quite well,
for I feel I must speak to you: It will
be a great thing for me if I get inâ
they'll think a lot of me at home. I
dare say they'll make me teacher In
the public schoolsâ or something. So
I ask you to tell me. I respect your
opinion a lot, Mr. Marshall."
, The words on Marshall s lips un
formed themselves. All his life he had
been popular; the admiration and lik
ing of his fellows was a necessity to
him. To hurt another â even to seem
unkind â was impossible. What Web
ster said was true. He also had seen
things as bad m the Salon, but he
knew that influence had placed them
there.
"I think what you say about confi
dence is the ticket," he said. "Your
own feeling is the best guide. Of
course, you know that there are lots
of risks â we all have to take them â
but I think every man should stand
on his own base, like a little tin sol
dier. You have three weeks to send
ing time, and there are some things I'd
alter if I were you. Those birds, now,
they're pretty big, aren't they? If you
brought them forward they'd be as big
as the man." He added a few more
â criticisms.
"By the by. what do you call it?"
he asked. "A good name is more than
great riches."
"I call it "Homeward Bound,' " said
Webster.
"That's good in English, but I'm
afraid the French will make it Nau
frage."
"Then you really advise me to send
it?"
"I'd try, anysvay." 1 said Marshall.
"Good-by. I must trot home."
On the quays the lamps were light
ed, casting their long shafts of light
into the water as Marshall strode
along.
"Now am I the greatest liar in
Paris," he asked himself, "or was I
right? Anyway, he'll find out for him
self, and it's not fair to make a Sir
Oracle of a man against his will."
In the Rue Dauphine Webster waa
putting on his kettle to boil chocolate.
There was no milk in it and he bought
only one roll that evening. Men who
have to buy frames should economize.
The next week passed under pres
sure of work, Marshall and the friend
â with whom he shared a studio both
toiling on the pictures they were send
ing to the Salon. The sending-in
days, however, passed at last, the
RALPH R.

easels stood empty and in the first
feeling of relief all the artists began
to idle and take their ease in the
lengthening days of spring.
In the general expansion of good
fellowship Marshall decided to look
up Webster, and he proposed it to
his chum as they were drinking
"bocks" one afternoon on the boule
vard.
On reaching the Rue Dauphine Mar
shall mounted the stairs and knocked.
There was no audible response, and af
ter waiting a few moments he pushed
open the door and entered. The room
was as before, except that a thick
layer of dust gave a faint bluish tone
to everything. On the narrow Iron bed
Webster lay extended. He lifted his
head at the sound of the opening door.
"Is it the letters, madame?" he asked.
His eyes met Marshall's, and there rose
in his face a faint expression of pleas
ure mingled with mortification. He
pulled the blanket up to his chin with
one hand, while he extended the other.
"Why, old man. I'm sorry you're ill!"
cried Marshall. "Here's Halstead. my
chum, and I came to get you for a
walk."
The mortification was uppermost in
Webster's face as he held cut his hand
to Halstead.
"I'm sorry you should find me like
this," he said in a faint voice, "but I've
been pretty bad for a few days, and
things get out of order. It's a shame
you fellows should come so far and find
me sick."
They chatted on for a while, and the
visitors rose to go. "I'll see you again
to-morrow," said Marshall.
Outside they found the woman of the
house and held a council. "If he is any
worse, send for the nearest doctor and
don't hesitate about expense," said
Marshall.
"Ah, messieurs!" cried the woman,
"that is the whole affair. Ever since
he began that picture he has not spent
a sou. First it must be brushes, paint
and canvas, and then a model,
and at last this frame. Such
a frame! Gilt, and as wide as that. Oh,
he starved not his picture; it was his
own poor stomach he starved. Ah! he
dipped his bread in his heart's blood
when he painted that picture, and now
my husband, who knows about such
things, he says it is not goodâ it will
not be accepted."
The friends walked some distance in
silence, then Marshall spoke. "We're
in for it, Tom."
"Yes," assented the other.
The -next few days brought no im
provement in Webster's condition. The
doctor was summoned, and pronounced
it a case of typhoid fever, brought on
'oy poor food and air, and the /-probable
tlse of bad water. Webster lay in a
half-torpid condition, from which it was
difficult to rouse him except at post,
times, when he became excited and
would eagerly debate the chances of
acceptance of his picture.
One day, as Marshall was about to
enter, the woman of the house N offered
him two letters which had Just arrived
for Webster. One was directed in a
feeble, woman's hand and bore an
American stamp, the other had on its
corner the image and superscription of
the Salon. He felt it, held it to the
light, and then put it into his pocket.
"Here's a letter from home," he an
nounced cheerfully.
Webster took it. "Isn't there any
thing from the Salon yet?" he eagerly
asked.
"No," replied Marshall with serene
mendacity; "but. you know, the longer
you wait the more chances you have."
That afternoon as Halstead was pre
paring for his afternoon tea Marshall
entered and closed the door behind him
with a bang. He sat down at the
piano and" ran his fingers over the keys
for some time in silence, then he
turned and faced his friend.
"I say," he began.
"Well?"
"This came for Webster to-day."
He held out the missive from the
Salon. Halstead took it, shook it, and
held It to the light.
"A rejection." he said. "Poor chap!
how is he going to take it?"
"He isn't going to take it at all,"
said Marshall with decision. "I tell
you he's got to have that picture in.
The doctor says there is hardly a
chance of his getting well, and the
only* thing that keeps him up is his
eagerness about this; but if he's dis
appointed he'll go. Like enough he'll
go anyway, but he s sure to if he hears
about this."
How are you going to manage,
though?" objected Halstead. "Tou

Varnishing day came, and found him
far too ill to think of going, and at
last the doctor shook his head and Â»aid
he feared the patient would not last

The chums took turns to sit with
him, but as the day wore on Marshall
refused. to give up his place, and the
two -settled down for the night The
soft dusk of a Paris evening began to
fall around 1 them. Webster seemed
asleep, ; and they kept silence, watch
ing: the sky changing from the green
ish reflections behind the dome of the
Pantheon to the warm darkness of a
spring night. Marshall rose and lit the
lamp, shading the light from the sick
man's eyes. â  â¢
Suddenly Webster began to speak In
a soft, even voice. "No," he said, "I'm
glad I came. It was worth while, and
now my picture's in. They can't say
any of them, it was no use to try it."
He turned his head. "Marshall â¢â¢ he
said.
"Yes. old man."
"You'll write and tell mother all
about it. and about the picture, you
know, and say I tried to make the
money go as far as I could. There'll
be enough to bury me. I think."
"Oh. that's all right, old man; you
mustn't talk like that. You're going
to get well and paint a lot more pic
tures." " v
"No, I'm not, and I'm sorter glad,
too. Maybe 1 couldn't have done an
other so good â another good enough,
to get into the Salon. You've both,
been real kind. I used to look at you
in Julian's and wish I was a big
strong man like you. I used to think
you were a dude." he added to Hal
stead. "I'm sorry."
He sank off into unconsciousness.
The night wore on. Through the half
open window came the occasional
sound of footsteps and the still less
frequent rattle of wheels. Suddenly
a voice in the street broke the silence,
singing. The noise roused Webster
who started.
"Air!" he cried. "I want air!"
Marshall lifted him. while Halstead!
threw the window wide.
"Pray." said Webster faintly. i
The two men exchanged a wild
glance.
. "You. began Hal3tead. "1 don't

hissed Marshall. "Anything will do,

buried his face in the coarse blanket,
. his shoulders working.
"More!" gasped the dying voice.
"Go pn," commanded Marshall.
Vague recollections of a church ser
vice long unheard and half forgotten
passed through Halstead's mind, and
sentence after sentence rose discon
nectedly to his lips like bubbles in a
champagne, glass. Webster was fight
ing for breath in Marshall's arms.

(Copyright by the S. S. McCtar* Co.)THE pitting of bug against buf is
a purely Califorr.ian invention.
It was evolved by the stress of
circumstances, and though at
first made the object of mirth and ridi
cule by other States, has proven an
idea of incalculable value, for It has
saved the fruit Industry of the State
from almost certain ruin.
California's greatest industry, the
one which brings in the greatest flood
of golden shekels and which has been
the chief factor in making the State
known better in all parts of the world
than any other State of the Union is
h'-r fruit industry. No other State can
pretend to compete with California in
this particular line. She raises more
fruit, better fruit and fruit of more
different kinds than is raised in any
other pert of the world. The value of
the fruit annually exported from this
State to the East and to foreign coun
tries is more than fifty million dollars-
The volume of the products of Califor
nia orchards that during the twelve
months of the year are shipped out of
the State by sea and rail is something
enormous. Last year the yield of cit
rus fruitsâ oranges and lemons
amounted to nearly 30,000 carloads
more than 10,000,000 boxes. Mare than
100,000 tons of fresh fruitâ peaches,
apricots, plums, cherries, etc.â were
exported. The output of the prune or
chards amounted to 165.000,000 pounds
(imagine living in an Eastern board
ing-house)! The yield of raisins was
120,000,000 pounds, enough to make
plum puddings for every man, woman
and child in the United States and
have plenty left over for 'other coun
tries. Thirty-seven thousand seven
..hundred and fifty tons of cured fruits,
exclusive of prunes, were exported.
More than 4.000,000 cases of fruit and
vegetables were canned during 1904.
The wine production amounted to more
than 34,000,000 gallons.
Pretty good showing, isn't ft? But
the figures themselves tell nothing of
the constant care .- and watchfulness
necessary to attain them, of the Inces- .
t-ant war against insect pests which if
left alone would quickly turn the
brimming cornucopia into an empty
conch shell, the fruitful orchards into
blighted wastes. The climate, of Cali
fornia, which is so favorable for the â 
production of the many fruits grown
here, is equally favorable for the in
crease of the numerous insect pests
which attack the trees. Few of these
Insects are natives of the State. . They
have been brought In from other States
or other parts of the â from Eu
rope. China, Australia, Mexico, Africa.
They have come in on fruit brought
from other ports, on nursery stock â¢
from other States or foreign countries.
In the early days of fruit growing in
California people knew less about this
danger than they do now. and little or
no attention was paid to it. As a con
sequence the orchardlsts of the State
awoke one day to the fact that the in
dustry was in danger of destruction
from the hordes of insect pests which
THEATRICAL SYNDICATE
ONE bright winter's day in Febru
ary, 1896, at an accidental lunch
eon in the Holland House. New
York, the gentlemen composing
what is 1 nown as the "Theatrical
Syndicate" were, discussing the busi
ness conditions of the theaters in New
York and throughout the country fol
lowing the three years of depression
Occasioned by the silver panic of 1893.
At the time Klav^ & Erlanger, two of
the men present, had carried on suc
cessfully what is km/wn in theatricals
ac a "bockfng agency" at 26 West Thir
tieth street. Charles Frohman, ten
blocks further up on Broadway, was
representing a chain of theaters ex
tending westward, with headquarters
In the Empire Theater building, ac
cording to Mr- Klaw in an interview in
the New York Times. Messrs. Nixon
& Zimmerman were the leading man
agers of Philadelphia, operating nearly
all the first-class houses in that city.
Al Haymsn was the owner of the Em
pire Theater building. A business al
liance was proposed between the six
men here mentioned by which the
bookings of attractions could be center
ed in one establishment, and before I
can g' any further I should like to ex
plain what a "booking agency" is, and
to do so I "will have to go back some
years to show the condition of the
theater in *he United States before
these comprehensive booking agencies
were established.
Lest than twenty years ago a for
midable percentage of the businese of
vhe theater was conducted on the side
walk. Id hotel offices, cafes, and, I re
gret to say, in barrooms. In those
days managers of theaters far and near
would come to New York after their
seasons were overâ usually Jn June,
July and Augustâ and inaugurate a
catch-as-catch-can meeting with the
n-.tnagers of what are called troupes or
combinations. It is difficult within the

THE BATTLE OF THE BUGS
were overrunning the orchards, pati ng
the fruit, boring into the trunks of the,
trees, destroying the leaves and laying
their ejrÂ«s hy countless millions every
where. Something had to be di-ne. Ths
common remedies, such as spraying,
fumigating, etc., were ineffectual. In
Irss tome other means of combating
the plague were found the orchardu of
th< State would be destroyed and their
owners ruired.
But the inventiveness of California
came to the rescue. Some one sug
gested that bugs be opposed to buss
and that beneficial insects be bn-aght.
in to fight the battle for the fruit
growers. The idea seemed on the facie
of it visionary. Fight bugs with bugs:
Foolishness! Man had tamed and turn
ed to his own use the horse. The ox
had been brought under the yoke. But
bugs! Preposterous: But the situa
tion was critical. Sc-mothing had to be
done and no better suggestion was of
fered. At lenst, no harm could be done,
so it was decided to try it.
The insect which at th^ time was do
ing the most damage was the cottony
cushion scale. This was brought int<>
California about the year 1868 by a
California nurseryman who imported
some lemon tree* from Australia. On
thef=e trees, unnoticed by anybody at
the time, were a few young of this in
sect. These young reached maturity
and multiplied without causing any
alarm The Idea never entered the
head of the nurseryman that they
would cost the citrus growers of the
State many millions of dollars. It got
into the orange groves of Southern
California and spread at an alarming
rate until soon the groves of that en
tire *ecti<m were overrun. It attacked
not only the orange trees, but many
other kinde of fruit. Even the fr.-rest
trees were not immune. Orange ship
ments fell from eight thousand car
loads a year to less than six hundred.
Many remedies were tried, but all were
equally ineffective. It seemed as if the
citrus industry of California were
doomed.
But it was not. A bug saved it, as a
bug threatened to ruin It. A little red
and black buy It was, known as the
Australian ladybird, or, to use the
name by which it is known to entomo
logists, Vidalia cardinalls. The man
who found it was Albert Koebele.
or what is sometimes known as a "pro
ducing manager."
The theater manager in those days
had an expensive establishment on his
hands. When his season was over he
usually found his following season's
time unfilled, with the exception of a
few weeks booked in advance by some
astute traveling manager, who proba
bly was holding the same time in sev
eral theaters until lie could Bee-saw
these local managers into giving him
terme upon which the local managers
could not live. This was the necessity
which created the booking agencies.
The booking agent acts as the repre
sentative of these theater managers
for a payment agreed uprm between
them, under which agreement the
agent keeps their vacant time on his
books in New fork and deals with the
managers of the traveling companies
to fill that time; and. notwithstanding
all assertions to the contrary, he takes
nothing from the control of the local
manager so far as the bookings are
concerned, because, after all is said and
done, he Is merely the agent of the lo
cal manager and cannot make con
tracts except with the approval of the
local manager. The. time and terms
arc always submitted to the local man
ager before the contracts are signed.
Now, this arrangement immediately
produced the following distinct bene
fits for the business of the theater:
Firstâ lt made the management of
theatrical business generally a digni
fied calling Instead of the haphazard
plan conducted upon the streets and in
cafes.
Second â It prevented the cunning
traveling manager on the one h;%d
from booking the same date in two
cities, while on the other hand the lo
cal manager could, not arbitrarily
throw out a date after it had fleen
booked, as was too often the case, be
cause once the booking agent estab
lished the date and contracts were
signed there was no such thing as de
stroying the evidence of an agreement-
Thirdâ lt made it possible, In the
event of disaster by conflagration, epi
demic or any other cause, to rearrange
the routes of companies so that they
would not have to lie Idle, thus pre
venting thousands of employes, includ
ing artiste, mechanics, transfer men
and others, from being thrown out of
temporary employment, and has dem
onstrated its efficacy in this regard
many times since, notably during the
yellow fever period Jn the Bouth, when
rigid quarantines were suddenly estab
lished, entailing the rearrangement of
many tourp.
Fourths-It compelled the carrying
nut by managers of their tours as
booked, thus giving the artists and
artisans employed in theatrical com
panies continuous employment, which
was almost impossible under the old
regime.
Fifthâ lt prevented useless and ruin
ous railroading by companies of the
same caliber, or of the same kind, in
an endeavor to avoid each other, or to
unnecessarily pit themselves against
each other in some given point that
was not able to support two attractions
of the same kind or of equal strength.
Sixth â It was a distinct betterment
of the profession as well as the busi
ness of the theater, and I want to make
myself clear that there is a profession
as well as a business In theatricals.
These two elements are as distinct,
yet as necessary to each other, as the
business department and the editorial
department of a newspaper. The pro
fession was bettered in this way: Ir
responsible managers, either local or
traveling, could not spread false re
ports about their receipts or about the
business they were doing, as the book-
Ing agents kept In close touch with
them. As a consequence, artists were
surer of their engagements, surer of
the payment of salaries and surer of
an avoidance of the many difficulties
and annoyances which ordinarily in
terfered with their stage work. A
manager who showed himself irre
sponsible and unreliable in his con
tracts and agreements could not carry
his schemes very far without detection.
The formation of the syndicate meant
nothing more nor less than the com
bining of two booking agencies into
one, and the syndicate has never been
anything more nor less than a larEei
booking agency. Its Influence upon the
profession of the theater (and by this
I mean the artistic side of the theater)
has been neutral because it has noth
ing to do with that end of the theater.

plays as they were before Its organisa
tion augurs nothing except that they
should be held individually responsible
for the merits or demerits of their pro
ductions, but they should not be held
as a syndicate, because the combina
tion, never in the whole history of the
syndicate, produced but a single play.
And it may surprise my readers to
know that in the city of New York
the syndicate absolutely controls only
one theater â namely, the Knicker
bocker.
Charles Frohman is the lessee of cer
tain theaters in New York and Messrs.
Klaw & Erlanger manage some thea
ters in New York, and Frohman and
Klaw & Erlanger together are inter
ested in some theaters, but these are
not syndicate ventures. The conduct of
the Empire Theater, the Hudson Thea
ter and the Lyceum Theater are dis
tinctly and independently in the hands
of Charles and Daniel Frohman. as the
Liberty Theater, New Amsterdam
Theater and New York Theater are In
the hands of Klaw & Erlanger. The
latter firm knows as little about Mr.
Frohman's plans and Intentions until
they are practically complete each
season as he knows about theirs.
Time for Mr. Frohman and Klaw &
Erlanger is booked exactly as any
body else's is.
Klaw & Erlanger as producers and
Charles Frohman as a producer are dif
ferent entities absolutely from the
syndicate of which they are members.
One or two disgruntled managers who
have not been able to use the syndicate
exactly as they pleased for their own
purposes and who could not get the
terms they demanded to the
detriment of every other attrac
tion have been crying that the business
of the theater was an art. The per
formances in a theater may be allied to
art or may be artistic, but the business
conduct of a theater Is and must be
commercial. The theater itself is a
business house, exhibiting the pictures
of the dramatist or composer under the
proper lights and most attractive
auspices, just as the picture dealer has
a business house in which he displays
the best efforts of the painters and il
lustrators. It is theirs to paint and
Illustrate: his to display the pictures
to the. public.
The accusation that the syndicate
gets a percentage of the gross receipts
of theaters Is a He which has- been so
often reiterated that it is hardly worth
denying. Unfortunately one or two
Koebele. at the instance of California
orch#rdlsts. was sent to Australia to
see if he could find there any remedy
for the condition of affairs in Cali
fornia. He found there the Vidalia
parasite oa the cottony cushion scale,
and brought some of them to this State.
They were propagated in the laboratory
and when a sufficient number of them
â¢ had been hatched out, they were turn
ed loose in the urange* grooves. The
hopes of the most optimistic were ex
ceeded. The ladybird at once com
menced a fierce and vigorous warfare
on the cottony cushion scale, a war of
extermination. No quarter was given.
Every i;ne of the destructive bugs
found by the parasite was remorse
lessly slain. The result! to-day there
can hardly be found a single specimen
of the scale In any of the orange groves
of California. The citrus industry was
saved by a bug.
That was the beginning of the work
ia which California has proved herself
the pioneer and in which she is far
ahead of any other State or country.
Encduraged by her success in this in
stance, the fruit growers.- declared war
on all insect pests,- a war., to be fought
by. proxy. It was nut necessary for the
frulfT 'growers of the State to go out
and .fight personally : against the bugs
"\vhtch were destroying their crops.
Thsy sent instead an army of bugs.
Both armies, the pernicious and the
beneficial bugs, , obtained reinforce
ments. The cottony cushion scale,
finding the flght going against it, called
to its' aid the yellow scale, a minute
Insect with the formidable name of
Chrysomphaius citrinus. Against these
was dispatched a division of . parasitic
insects with a name equally awe-ln
spirlng. Aspidiotophagus citrinus. This
parasite had been kept down by spray
ing, but when this practice was sus
pended to give it a chance to Increase,
it bred in such numbers that soon it
practically wiped out its enemy. Then
Comys fusca attacked the brown apri
cot scale so effectively that the pest,
which at one time threatened to be
come a serious menace to apricot grow
ing, is easily kept in check. Other
parasitic armies attacked other scale
insects, in some instances defeating
them signally, while in other cases the
battle Is still going on and is unde
cided. But in almost no case has the
fight gone seriously against the armies
theatrical men who have seen fit to at
tack the syndicate's methods have free
ly indulged* in personalities to main
tain their arguments, one man in the
magazine arttcle recently .announced)
that th* syndicate, persecuted Henri
etta Crosman: because she produced a
play upon the same theme as one
which Miss Ada Rehan was then play
ing In New York City under the man
agement of Klaw & Erlanger. The
fact is that Miss Crosman was booked
by Klaw & Erlanger in that very play
In the city of New York, and her con
tract bears the stamp of Klaw & Er
langer's office. Perhaps Mr. Campbell,
Miss Crosman's manager, from whose
eyes the independent cataract has now
been removed, may testify to this.
This same man, on the opening night
of Mlsa Crosman in New York a few
years later, told some newspaper men
of the metropolis with ill-concealed
hints and Innuendoes that some one
had cut the ropes of his scenery, thus
delaying the entertainment that even
ing, and in an abnormal bid for mar
tyrdom endeavored to leave the im
pression that some enemies had done
this. When the mechanics' union took
the matter up and Investigated it, and
it was found that no ropes of any
kind had been cut, he quickly receded
from the position and wrote them a
letterâ a copy of which I possess â in
which he admitted that nothing of the
kind had happened and denied that
he had ever made such an accusation.
Yet he never denied the accusation
when it appeared In print in a half
dozen newspapers.
As for the syndicate's attitude to
ward dramatic criticism, it has none â
can have none, because, as I have
stated before. It produces no plays. But
to accuse managers of an attempt to
"stjÂ§e and muzzle" dramatic criticism
is manifestly absurd. Any manager
of experience knows that the most
laudatory criticism cannot save a bad
play from failure. His one desire, there
fore, both as a business man and as
one who wishes to deal fairly with
the public. Is to keep the standard of
dramatic criticism on the highest level.
It is to his best interests to have it
absolutely Impartial, absolutely just,
and always on the most dignified
plane. Only those newspaper writers
who have repeatedly - and flagrantly
departed from this standard have been
requested to absent themselves by the
managers in question from their thea
ters. Assuredly thera is justification
in protesting against newspaper writ
ers who bitterly and scandalously at
tack productions not in the Interests of
their readers, but in that of other man.*

known as Scnteliista cyanea, which is
at present playing havoc. with ,the black

This . Insect was introduced from CapÂ«
Colony, where -it had been doing ex
cellent - work in â  keeping %' down tha
numbers of its natural enemy, or rath

" insects j was < made ;. in . October lof 1901.

Commissioner, and seventeen of tha
insects hatched out. Of these four were

; had remained hidden in a leaf in the
: hatching' cage, killed one of the fe
â¢ males. This left but three insects with,
which to colonize the" groves of the en
tire State of California and fight thÂ«
countless millions of the black seals
; which were devastating the orange or
chards. It looked like a one-sided fight.
But the result; has proved to be th<Â«
-opposite of what one 1 ' might expect.
, To-day the descendants :of these three
bugs have practically cleaned out the
' black scale in - some . sections of the
State, and the. i prospects are that be

George Compere had discovered a par

these parasitic insects was re

had been found by the bug

>O\ the rare opportunity during the
X^J P ast month of seeing at the < 'en
i lury club an exhibition of paint
ince by one of Japans representative
artists of this decade.
The Western world j s j juts t awakening
â â  ih*> fa- 1 that in tht Land of the
Rising Sun may be found a develop
ment of the pictorial arts which,
though different from our own, is fully
as great, and possibly, in some re
sects, greater.
Advanced art students seeking fur
ther instruction and sources of inspira
tion are vending their way to the
Orient to study its achievements; and
educational institutions in this coun
try and Europe are including Oriental
art as a most important culture sub
ject in their courses of instruction.
San Francisco â by virtue of her loca
tion, being the gateway from the Ori
ent to this country â has for some years
offered unusual educational facilities
for becoming acquainted with Eastern
art through the wares displayed in her
shops.
This has resulted in a genuine and
sincere interest in Japanese color
prints and painting; an interest which
manifests itself when any opportunity
is presented for the acquisition of any
further knowledge on this subject.
No sooner had Mr. Ikkwa Kagai
sailed in from the Orient than the
thought of a possible exhibition in Jap
anese effects presented itself, and the
keen interest and appreciation which
v.&s expressed for his work was not
only a testimony to his ability, but
also io the culture of the San Francisco
people as well. For, be it known. Jap
anese painting is the caviar of art and
only people of trained sensibilities and
poetic art feeling can rise to the com
prehension of it.
Japanese pictures have been sent to
this country ever since the little brown
man felt that he had gained a firm
footing in the Occident, but never be
fore has the opportunity presented it
pelf for the people of the West to see
Japanese art in the real sense of the
v-ord.
Nor would this opportunity have
slipped in so timely had not Mr.
Nagai taken it into his head io travel
.-bout the world and take a peep at
the work of his brothers in order that
he might know just what was being
accomplished in the world of paints
and delightful, dreamy ideals. At
home, in Tokio. he is known as the
artist who won three gold medals at
the Kwai-gwa-kyo-shin kwai. or in
plain English, the imperial fine arts
exhibition; but here, if he was known
Xt all, it was merely as the man who
made a specialty of crows. And now
after his exhibition he is known more
ihan ever as the "crow man,' for
though he had fully half a hundred
paintings on the walls his favorite
study undoubtedly had the strongest
qualities. The gTeat black masses
against the soft gray white grounds
could be seen from the most distant
part of the building, and one almost
felt ones self in the vicinity of the
' b nests and listened unconsciously
lor their cawing, for there were crows
singly and in pairs, on the wing and
at rest, in conjugal harmony and in
fierce conflict. But in addition to
These, upon closer inspection could be
seen beautiful flower compositions, in
cluding the morning glory, the iris
and the lotus, done after the manner
:orin, whose style has left such
a marked influence on modern French
art. There were also delightful fish
subjects, in which could be seen the
oriental carp leaping the waterfall or
disporting himself in other ways, done
-ding to the Shijo style, and a
r.umber of landscapes that spoke
strongly of Chinese influence.
It was gratifying to see Japanese
a its purity, for it must be ad
mitted regretfully that there is a pre
vailing disposition among Japanese
ti to forsake the traditions of
their ancestors and adopt European
methods, generally resulting disas
trously. O/icntcl and Occidental civ
ilizations are so unlike that it seems
almost impossible for them to assim
ilate. The view noint is so different
in both that neither understands the
other, and for the one to use the art
forms of the other is not only incon
sistent, but cannot help but result in
a product that is a mere travesty
upon the Â«riginal. ,
The late schools of Japanese art
manifest considerable European influ
ence, but there Is a wide difference
between an expression of fundamental
art principles and the imitation of the
mere forms of art. Japan has a great
ut of her own and it is most unfor-
tunate that she fails to see its ruin
in the advent of western ideas.
A comparative study of Oriental
and Occidental art shows the one to
be a subjective expression, while the
other is objective. The former deals
with the life and spirit of things and
the latter with the life forms. The
Oriental artist studies his subject in
a contemplative mood, striving at its
spiritual significance, at the noble
thought the subject inspires, while the
Occidental artist studies the object or
objects â which are his models â scien
tifically, for the purpose of represent
ing them with absolute accuracy. The
difference between the two schools is
the difference between art and rep
resentation, and the Western world is
rapidly learning that representation is
not art. The methods of work of the
two schools are distinctly different.
The Occidental, working directly from
a model, is generally handicapped by
this limitation; the Orientalist studies
the objects of his subjects until he is
perfectly familiar with them and can,
as expressed by a Japanese, "draw
them at v.il!."
His result !s not scientifically accu
rate and his drawing is generally criti
cized, but he has learned the lesson of
wise selection, for in his estimation
only the essential features are worthy
of representation. He is successful by
virtue of his practice of wise elimina
tion of non-essentials.
The art forms which he employs to
express his ideas are equally simple.
On soft papers or transparent silks,
with water color and India ink, by
means of flat color and simple line,
he suggests as much as he expresses,
for the artificial system oX studying
light and shade has no more appealed
to him than the careful delineation of
detail that is to be found in the West
ern system. He only sees diffused
light and broad, flat masses.
His technique is his brush line, a
line that mufit represent the flow and
grace of controlled spontaneity; or, to
quote a Chinese exoression. "follow
ing the will of the brush." It may
be line or coarse, of uniform or gradu
ated widths, but it must represent the
effect of, a directed force.
His art is both ideal and conven
tional, and to comprehend it -one must
know something of his ideals and be
familiar with his conventions.
He derives most of his Ideals from
nature, and while frequently seeing it
in terms of convention, he always dis
cerns its practical and moral sig
nificance, which he relates to his own
life and expresses in his own art.
When Mr. Nogai was asked why
crows had been selected as a desirable
subject for pictures, he replied that
they represented one of the greatest
examples of filial piety in the animal
world, and explained that the young
crows always devote the first three
months â after being able to fly from
the nest â in curing for and feeding
the mother crow, thereby repaying
her for her trouble in rearing them.
His little crow story is significantly
told to Japanese children, as a beau
tiful lesson, and all pictures of crows
are suggestive of the thought of being
faithful to their parents.
The crow is considered a very wise
and intelligent bird and there are a
number of superstitions associated
with him. For example, a destroyed
crow's nest is always indicative of a
fire in that locality â within three
da>-6 â and if a crow lights on a house
and caws sorrowfully a calamity .is
sure to befall it, or If his joyful "car
row" is heard it is a sure sign of good
luck.
It la commonly â â¢!* that the crows
are the reincarnation of the departed
Japanese, hence their intelligence; but
they are likewise full of mischief and
at times very mean. For example, a
common practice among them is to
tease kittens; but they never think of
attacking a full-grown cat. They have
a strong community spirit, and unite
in destroying a i ommon enemy and
protecting: one of their own. At the
slightest sign of alarm they will go
to the rescue.
Upon one occasion the crows an
noyed a foreigner livii\g in Tokio by
destroying his garden. They would
deliberately pull up the flowers and
commit depredations, even to entering
the house through the windows and
carrying off his possessions. They
doubtless did this to show their dis
approval of a foreigner in their .midst.
One day the gentleman caught one
of them in the very act of destruction
and his exhausted patience external
ized itself in a dead crow. The smoke
of the revolver had hardly died away
before the sky was darkened by black
wings, and upon his abode there set
tled a dusky mantle accompanied with
a noisy din of caws. The entire crow
population had come to investigate
the case, and they forcefully expressed
their indignation, after which, with
drooping heads, tails and wings, they
set to mourning the death of their
comrade and then disappeared, taking
with them the dead crow. From that
time the place was marked, for not a
crow was seen in that vicinity for a
year and a half.
It is generally known that crows al

Been anywhere. What they do with
them !s unknown. TJhey have their
little difficulties at times, and if there
is a quarrel, it is generally a contest
to the death of one or the other. The
situation is generally understood by
the others and there is no Interfer
ence.
They also enjoy playing tricks on
each other. One day a crow was seen
flying about with what appeared to
be a large shrimp â an article of food
they consider a great delicacy and
over which they have frequent dis
putes for possession.
He seemed to display it intentionally
for the purpose of attracting atten
tion. In this he was successful, and in
a short time he was pursued by a
large company. He led them about
the heavens for some time and then
descended to the grojind. dropping
the coveted thing. There was a gen
. eral scramble, but he made his escape
and it was only when the others heard
his laugh of derision from afar that
they realized they had been fooled. It
was no shrimp at all, only a piece of
red rag.
The crow is not only an interesting
bird, but he is a beautiful bird and
lends himself to pictorial expression
to which the given illustrations will
testify. KATHIIRINE M. BALL.A THING OR TWO ABOUT ETIQUETTE

I knew of a zrlrl who was to be

Foolish? Certainly not. 'He turned
the spoon over in his mouth and drag

"In a disgusting manner" tells the
whole story*. Just as long as the little
god throws dust in your eyes and
makes you think that Tom, Dick or
Harry, or Molly or Jennie, just as the
case may be, Is the loveliest ever, it Is
all fine and . daisy and nothing but
happiness can result, but let the least
suspicion of doubt creep In and there's
a peck of trouble. ...
If he was disgusting to her once he
evidently had fallen from his Binnacle,
and no matter how hard she tried she
never could quite boost him to, that
exalted elevation again. Little by lit

turn away from- him until some trifling
act would set her teeth on edge.

Correspondents
SOCIAL CALLS (Doubtful). â A
first call should be returned within
ten days; after that you may regulate
calls aa best suits your convenience
and the degree of intimacy you desire
to maintain. Remember, however,
that it is always best not to be too
hasty in social matters â no well-bred
woman rushes hastily into a friend
ship which she may regret later on.
Avoid being too cordial until you are
satisfied that the acquaintance Ik likely
to be agreeable to both parties. A
pleasant dignified mem can never give
offense, but effusive cordiality which

suredly a lady should pay her own
car fare; there is no reason why a man

should pay her fare. Should he insist
of course acquiesce, but by the exer
cise of a little tact a lady may pay her
own fare quickly and be relieved from
any obligation; moreover, the man
will admire her the more for her in
dependence.
BITING THE LIPS (Jean).â Poets
and artists sing of "the light that lies
in woman's eyes." but every one will
agree that even a plain face is re
deemed by a well-shaped mouth, which,
next to the eyes, registers clearly the
varied moods of the human face: it
behooves women, therefore, to make
the most of this feature. Having form
ed the habit of biting the lips from
nervous excitement or any passing
emotion, only a determined effort on
your part can overcome the habit. If,
continued It will surely make the lips
thick and coarse. The reason for this
is obvious. The pressure" and knead
ing motion of the teeth on the lips
act almost exactly like massaee and
particularly so if cold cream la applied
to allay any Irritation of the skin: then
you have the whole process of massage
and the result is inevitable. To avoid
self-consciousness, which might result
if you attempted to think of the fault
continually, dab the lips with some
harmless bitter solution to .act as a
reminder. Quinine is suggested. Dis
solve two grains of quinine In a small
phial of water and apply with a brush
or bit of cotton; dab some on the index
finger-nail, which you nibble when per
plexed. Continue the application daily
until the habit is broken.
MISTAKES OF THE JOLLY GIRL
(Gladys).â The jolly, all-round girl is
the dearest creature In the world and
as welcome everywhere as sunshine
provided she does not carry her jollity
to excess. If several of your best
friends have complained that you are
too jolly, I fear you have allowed your
high ppirlts to- lead you into some ways
that are annoying to others. While it
may have hurt your pride to be criti
cized, it has caused you to think, and to
think is the surest way to learn. While
Bel f- examination may not be altogether
flattering, It will clearly show where
the most glaring faults lie and, like a
sensible girl, you will profit by the dis
covery. Fot very gladness, the jolly
girl sometimes forgets to greet her
friends with quiet cordiality, but
lapses into rather boisterous effusive
ness; again, from very exuberance the
voice, which should be low and sweet,
is pitched too high In general conversa
tion and often punctuated vrlth ltrud,
ringing laughter. Pranks and jokes
enjoyed ofttimes by every one become

INGROWING TOE NAILS (Jean).
â This painful growth should be taken
In hand as soon as it becomes manifest
or serious results may follow. The
most important ' thing to do is to get
rid of the particle of nail which is irri
tating the flesh. To get the nails in
pliable condition to trim hold the feet
in a warm bath for at least fifteen
minutes, then dry and rub them with
alcohol". ÃBe a pair of sharp, pointed
scissors and trim away as much of the
nail as possible and all of the dead
cuticle which will be found packed
under the corner of the nail as ; a re
sult of he feversih condition of the toe.
Great care must be taken that no
abrasions of the -skin are made, for
such are both painful and dangerous;
it is for this -reason that the use of the
scissors is ad-vised in place of a knife,
for the former may be held Aintfer
better control. Should a cut of the
skin be accidentally made, bathe the
wound with a bit of carbolated cotton
dipped into an antiseptic such as di
luted listerine or carbolic acid (one
part of acid to sixty parts of water)
and wear a white stocking until the
abrasion heals. Treat the nails at
night by wetting a piece of carbolated
cotton in tincture of arnica and bind
ing over the toe*. During the day
bathe the toes several times with spir
its of camphor or tincture of arnica,
and if the nails are hard and dry rub
freely with camphorated oil. Nightly
footbaths, a daily change of stockings
and rather loose soft shoes will mate
rially assist in overcoming the ten
dency to ingrowing nails.
RED NOSE (Unhappy).â The skin
of the nose is very sensitive and sure
to herald every physical disturbance,
no matter from what cause. The wear
*ing of tight clothing, nervousness and
dyspepsia are all indicated in the skin
of the nose. Morbidness is frequently
the cause of the skin on the nose be
coming coarse and the pores clogged.
.Consult your physician and obtain re
lief from the bilious attacks to which
you are subject; build up your system
by plain and nourishing food, cutting
out the liberal supply of sweets in
which you now indulge. Exercise
freely out out of doors and sleep in a
well ventilated .room. Cleanse the
stomach eÂ«h morning by drinking a
pint, if possible, of hot water half an
hour before breakfast, which will has
ten the restoration of normal condi
tions. Refrain from irritating the
nose and to reduce the color dust
lightly with a good toilet powjer. At
night treat the nose and the rest of
the lac* as well to a warm bath, fol
lowed by cold water dabbled over the
face with the' hands or a small velvet
sponge; then gently massage the face,
giving special attention to the nose
and lastly apply a tonic lotion. A de
lightful aonic is made by mixing one
half pint each of rosewater, witch
hazel and sixty drops of simple tinc
ture of benzoin. This will strengthen,
whiten and relieve the sensitive condi
tion of the skin and may be freely
used two or three times each day.
TO RELIEVE SOFT CORNS (Ella).â
Immediate relief from the torture of
a sof t corn between the toes can only
be gained by removing all pressure on
the corn. This ia most readily ac
complished by placing a wad of cot
ton ' between the toes to keep them
apart; but a more convenient appli
ance is the corn plaster sold at any
drug store. Those in the form of a
ring of adhesive plaster fit nearly
around the corn and keep the pressure
off the most sensitive part. As soft
corns are the outgrowth of dampness
as well as of pressure, it is of the ut
most importance that the feet be kept
dry at all times. Be particular to
bathe the feet every day, using warm
water and plenty of soap; dry thor
oughly and dust the feet freely with
talcum powder. If the feet perspire
you should dust the inside of the shoes
as well as your feet several times each
day, seeing that the powder is placed
well between the toes. Attention in
this respect will prove very restful even
when the feet are not afflicted with soft
corns. Never apply any oily substance
to a soft corn, for It will merely serve
to increase the irritation. If the com
is of considerable growth the top may
be cut away, being careful not to col
deep enough to draw blood: then rut
in. some arnica or strong spirits ol
camphor to take out the acute soreness
and dust with talcum powder after ap
plying the corn plaster as directed.
Do not be persuaded to use the prep
arations which blister the skin b?.dlv.
for while this is thequickest method
<;f removing a corn, the painful ten
derness of the skin between the toes
is even greater than the corn itself.
and on some feet would result in ad
ditional corns.
'fO FIT A SKIRT (Margaret.)â
When the front gore of a dress skirt
pulls upward and outward in a fold
near the bottom, there are manifold
reasons for the fault. Either th" skirt
has been cut out too much at the top,
the belt is not set on correctly or the
fault is with the figure, which may be
more than normally full over the
abdomen, or the fault may be in the
manner of standing. Stand correctly
before a mirror with the abdomen in,
chest out and shoulders level and erect.
If no improvement in the set of the
skirt is noted, carefully rip off the belt,
across the front gore and about half
way back on the side gores, then slip
on the skirt and pin the belt at the
back correctly to hold up the skirt.
Allow the top edge of the skirt to fall
below the loose belt about one inch in
middle of top edge of front gore, and
carefully note if the fault is improved.
If so you may be sure the skirt is cut out
too much at the top to fit your 9gure.
To remedy the fault carefully baste a
piece of firm cambric or taffeta under
neath, the required width, and also on
top of the side-gores. Baste the belt
on again allowing the additional length
to be greater exactly in center of front
gore and graduate off until near the
hack edge of side gores it is narrowed
to a mere thread and the belt is joined
evenly to the top edge of back gores.
The skirt should then hang perfectly if
the cut and fit of other seams is cor
rect. To cover the piecing at the top
of skirt you may wear a deeply pointed
girdle cr simulate a yoke with bands of
trimming.
OAT MEAL (Eleanor). â The so
called simple dish of oat meal becomes
a nightmare, as it is usually prepared,
and the haphazard methods employed
in cooking most cereals are largely re
sponsible fcr the many failures and
account for many of the Jeers we hear
concerning breakfast foods. lam not
booming breakfast foods, to use a
common expression, but am simply en
deavoring to show how, by proper
preparation, cereals may be made to
add greatly to the value of our dally
meals. The common, ordinary oat
meal such as may be bought in bulk
at any grocer's requires thorough cook
ing to be digestible and palatable and
nutritious; not the usual one or two
hours of boiling, but four or five hours
of slow simmering with the lenst pos
sible stirring. This will give one
plumb grains, almost as separate aa
the grains of well-cooked rice. The
sticky mass, so repulsive to the fasti
dious taste, is the result of careless
cooking and much stirring. To obtain
the best results In cooking oatmeal a
double boiler is essential; it prevents
scorching. My recipe, which is suffi
cient for six persons, is as follows:
Take two teacupfuls of oatmeal and a
teaspoon even full of salt. Put into
the upper part of the double boiler
and pour over it one quart or boiling
water. Stir just enough to prevent the
formation of any lumps, till the under
pan with hot water, unite the pan?,
cover and took slowly for four or five
hours, adding more hot water from
time to time as required. When dona
remove the cover and set in a coot
place until needed for breakfast, then
heat thoroughly by filling the under
pan with hot water, adding a trifle of
water to the oatmeal if it Kerns too
sti/T. cover closely and heat for fifteen
minutes. Stem in dainty china bowls,
set on pretty plates, accompanied with
rich sweet cream and powdered sugar,
ami I am sure you will pronounce it a
decided success.
HINTS FOR THE WEAK WOMAN
(TO. M. L.). â A woman who has no dis
coverable organic trouble, yet is weak
bodily, nervous, troubled with insom
nia, and sits quietly in the house the
greater part of the day. need not won
der at her condition. Imperfect room
ventilation, sluggish circulation of the
blood, the result of Inaction, and the
ensuing nervous depression are calcu
lated to produce the st%te you are in.
You MM make a radical change in
your mode of living as rapidly as your
health will permit. While a correct
diet and nine hours of refreshing sleep
are essential to your restoration to
health, fresh air and exercise out
doors are equally imperative. The
world is full of women who are miser
able from a chronic, tired feeling; half
the Joys of living are lost simply from
lack of endurance, but if circum
stances or habit could force women
outdoors for several hours daily many
more would be strong and vigorous.
A woman cannot afford to sacrifice a
short brisk walk dally; health and
beauty both demand the exertion. The
distance walked should be increased
as the health warrants. After you
have become accustomed to regular
exercise outdoors insomnia will soon
be a thing of the past to you. Light
movements with dumbbells or with a
patent exerciser done before retiring
are also helpful in strengthening the
muscles, giving grace and vigor to
both body and mind. The value of
deep breathing cannot be overesti
mated and should be indulged in for
five minutes several times each day
until all unpleasant effects such as diz
ziness are overcome. The most im
portant result of deep breathing la the
increased oxygenation of the blood and
the rar*d elimination of waste matter
carried by the blood to the lungs.
Wear only a loose gown, stand before
an open window and inhale thÂ«alr
gently until the lung 3 expand, but do
not strain. Then aa gently exbale> re
peating until a sense of fatigue in felt.
Never practice these breathing exer
cises directly after a meal; wait an
hour or more. In a few weeks I think
you will begin to notice improvements.
AN ATTRACTIVE HAND (Hel
en). â Few realize the beauty of a per
fect hand until they observe Its charm.
in the gestures of a polished actress or
society woman. In this practical age
the majority of women must do more
or less which roughens the fine tex
ture of the skin so it is little wonder
that the busy well-bred woman wJÂ»o
does not wish to proclaim to the world
her occupation by peculiar digital
blemishes is at a loss how to avoid it.
There are no short cuts to having at
tractive hands. Exquisite care must
be bestowed upon them and especially
upon the nails if their beauty Is to
be maintained. So much depends up
on one's occupation that the frequency
of treatment can only be determined
by the individual. While there are
nails good, bad and indifferent, none
are quite hopeless n? taken vigorously
in hand and given the care which
the nature of the case demands. If
the hands have been badly neglected
a half dozen treatments by a skilled
manicurist will show a wonderful im
provement and you wilt pick up some
points in treatment which you can
utilize in the home care. A few good
tools are essential: A pair of sharp
curved scissors, a fine nail file, -an
orange stick, a chamois covered buf
fer and nail powder; lemon Juice, and
vaseline. Always soak the finger tips
in tepid soapy water, slightly per
fumed, before beginning treatment.
This softens the cuticle and prevents
the nails breaking under the ftle or
acisÃora. Trim the nails in a pretty
oval, smoothing down the edges with
the file. If discolored under the wail
do not scrape but use the edge of the
fiat file and also brush with lemon
juice. Press back the scarf 3kin at
the base of the nail, avoiding rough
T ressure which will cause agnails. If.
from neglect, there* be quite an accu
mulation of scarf skin it may be re
moved by repeatedly soaking the
finger tips and rubbing the skin away
with a soft dry cloth. Rub a little
powder on each nail and polish with
the buffer. To whiten the skin use
the following lotion several times each
day. It is made by mixing one-halt
pint of white brandy, three ou
white wine vinegar and three ounces
of lemon juice.These Are

EUROPEAN MONARCHS, FOLLOWING OUT ANCIENT CUSTOM,
WASH THE FEET OF ORDINARY MENDICANTS IN PUBLIC
Old Easter Ceremony Becomes Mere Farce as Now
Performed in Spain and Austria.
Banquets of Which They May Not Eat Put Before Beggars
LONDON. April 15.â A1l over Catholic
Europe the Thursday before Easter is
known aa "Maundy " Thursday. This
year it falla on April 20, on which day
the venerable Emperor of Austria and
the youthful King of Spain will go
through their annual Maundy Thurs
day ceremonyâ that of washing the feet
of twelve beggars. This Is perhaps the
queerest and most archaic of all the
quaint and ancient customs attending
the observance of Easter in the Old
World, and that most abounding in
ttartllng contrast* between genuine
pomp and pretended piety, gorgeous
jageantry and mock humility.
"Dies mandati," whence the name ie
derived, implies the holy origin of the
foot-washing ceremony. It commemo
rates, of course, that crowning act of
divine humifity. the washing of the feet
of his twelve apostles by Him whom
Christendom hails as king of kings. In
medieval times, when church and
throne were far more closely linked
than now, this imitation of Christ was
-ally performed by European mon
p ago most of them dis
carded it for the more convenient prac
of distributing doles by proxy.
Only at thÂ« court* of Madrid and Vien
na Is the custom etill kept up.
It was the writer's good fortune last
year to witness the Madrid perform
ance as one of the four hundred and
odd spectators squeezed into one of the
side galleries of the stuffy and 111-ven-
Tilated Sala de las Columnar â Hall of
the Columns â though why that name
should be bestowed upon it, seeing that
-â¢lumns are only half-columns, and
t,v no means remarkable at that, is one
of the many puzzles in which Spam
abounds. As the ceremony down to its
smallest details is prearranged and con
ducted in accordance with hide-bound
'ient. a description nf what was
â rfH apply to what will be wit
r>d this year.
BFGGARS FINFT.Y DREPSFD.
On a bench were seated the . twelve
male mendicants who were supposed
to symbolize -the twelve disciples.': In
place of their ' accustomed picturesque
habiliments of poverty and woe, the
beggars were all dressed for the occa
sion In elegant black coats, with turn
down "white collars, white ties and the
rseatest of fhoes and socks on the feet
to be washed by royalty. On the knees
of each of them rested that most hon
ored symbol of prosperity and respect
ability, a stovepipe silk hat. Probably
these fame property clothes do duty
vcar. after year, even to the one-legged
trousers provided for the single speci
men of the one-legged suppliant, for
public charity present. Madrid . pos
sesses such a number and ; variety of
mendicants that it Is. far easier to pick
out' begpars to <?t* the clothes than
make clothes. to ,rtt the beggars.

ues. they blinked owl-like at the spec
tators. No levity on their part, it was
evident, would mar the solemnity of I
the farce. Two of them had crutches
beside them. One had a patch over his
left eye: another had a natch over his
right. None of th?m was old eqpugh ,
to be a f fli< ted with the infirmities of
age. Needless to say, they had all
Deen wÂ«-ll scoured and fumigated be- ;
forehand. A genuine washing had pre- \
ceded the public make-believe wash
ing. Never did beggars stand less in |
need of an application of soap and wa
ter to their feet.
CEREMONIAL ENTRANCE.
A tapestry depicting the last supper
draped the altar, and on either side of â 
it stood bareheaded halberdiers. Before
It burned six tall candles in massive
silver sticks. A silver basin, gold and
silver ewers a-nd lace-fringed towels
wen disposed close at hand. Below on
a carpeted dais stood a long table coy- i
ered with a snowy cloth and laid with
a dozen covers. Opposite the gallery
apportioned to the spectators was an- :
other gallery dtvoted for the occasion
to royalty and its satellites and the ;
Embassadors aiid Ministers of foreign i
powers with their attendant suites. '
For royalty gold chairs were provided.
Diplomacy had to be content with
plush.
Through a door, around which gor
geous flunkies clustered thick, the rep
resentatives of the mighty made their
advent. First came the Chinese repre
sentative in priestlike robes, followed
by his suite. Much one would have
liked to have known what the Celestial
dignitary thought of It all, but his face
was inscrutable as that of the sphinx.
Embassadors and members of the
Spanish Cabinet followed, all arrayed
In their showiest uniforms and glit
tering with decorations. There was a
long wait before royalty made its en
trance and the plebeian crowd in the
other gallery who had no seats cast
envious glances at the vacant gilded
chairs. Royalty swept in at last, ar
rayed as for a court function; men In
Muriel with gold trimmings and
medal? galore; women in silks and
brorades. with dainty little pages
bearing up thei- trains, and a-glitter
with diamonds and precious gems.
The Queen Mother came in by a spe
cial door, her train born by a stately
majordomo. She looked slightly bored
and eyed the crowd languidly through
a lorgnette, as though at an opera.
Before the young King ascended the
throne she had to do the foot-washing.
ALFONSO IN HUMBLE ROLE.
A fanfare of trumpets sounded
faintly from without. Louder swelled
the music ;<s a band struck up "The
li of Garclalso." Doors swung
open. and. heralded by gaudily clad
couri officers, the boy King entered.

simplicity of which presented a pleas
ing contrast to the elaborate brilliancy
of the attendant throng. He seemed a
bit shy and awkward and lost no time
in getting to work.
To each of the dozen paupers had
been assigned a Spanish nobleman of
high degree. While the priests chanted
prayers and the odor at burning in
cense filled the hall, these dukes and
marquises knelt before their charges
and removed their left shoes and socks.
The beggars looked as stolid and In
different as though they had been ac
customed to that sort of thing every
day of their lives. When each had one
fout bare, the Duke of Sotomayor
poured some water from a golden ewer
into the silver basin.
Beginning at one end of the line, the
King knelt before every beggar in turn,
sprinkled a little water over his naked
foot, made a dab at it with the towel
and followed it up with a kiss, or the
pretense of one â for whether the royal
lips really touched the flesh of the beg
gars' feet none of those in the specta
tors' gallery would be prepared to make
an affidavit. The fact that each beggar
had only one foot subjected to a pre
tense of washing served to accentuate
the perfunctory character of the per
formance. It was all finished in a few
EUROPEAN RULERS, WHO, IN A WAT, KEEP UP THE ANCIENT EASTER CEREMONY OF WASHING THE FEET OF

minutes. Amid such a brilliant setting
anything more unlike the act of the
Son of Man in Galilee, which it is sup
posed to symbolize and commemorate,
the imagination could not conceive.
THE rXTASTED MEAL.
But compared with what followed it
at least possessed a semblance of real
ity. The foot-washing over, each
grandee replaced his beggar's shoe and
sock and the dozen representatives of
pauperdom were escorted to the ban
quet board. With his own hand the
King laid before each of them a plate
containing something like a pancake.
No beggar touched his portion, or even
so much as sniffed at it. With hands
by their sides they gazed stolidly be
fore them.
Unabashed by this contumacious re
jection of the first course of the royal
menu, the King gathered up the plates,
handed them one by one to the
grandees standing behind the beggars'
chairs, who in turn passed them on to
a long line of flunkies, who carried
them without. The King next served
them with fish. Still none tasted of it.
The dishes disappeared as before and
were replaced by another course, that
was treated in the same fashion.
The paupers were not allowed to eat.
It was a Barmeeidal feast to which
they had been Invited. It was they who
were doing penance, while the agile
royal waiter displayed to the admiring
throng his meekness and humility. By
the King's hands alone everything was
placed on the table and by him re
moved. The tantalizing, hunger-pro
voking meal lasted a full hour. With
much bowing and courtesylng the noble
company dispersed. And the mendi
cants, having played their part in the
royal show, retired, to be stripped of
their property garments, and resuming
their rags and tatters returned to beg
gardom.
CUSTOM IN AUSTRIA.
The Vienna ceremony follows much
the same lines, but it is better man
aged and the farcical element is less
predominant. The personality of the
aged Emperor, whom everybody knows
to be a genuinely devout man afflicted
with many sorrows during his long life,
imparts a dignity to the function which
is entirely lacking in the Spanish one.
The twelve poor old men who symbol
ize the twelve disciples are not pro
fessional mendicants. Instead of ele
gant black cloaks and high hats they
are attired in quaint old German cos
tumes.
The Barmeeidal feast precedes the
perfunctory footwashing. At the con
clusion of the latter the Emperor fast
ens around the neck of each of his
aged guests a purse containing thirty
pieces of silver. They are conveyed
back to their humble homes in Imperial
carriages and each takes with him a
basket containing his share erf the
banquet which he was not permitted
to eat In the royal presence. In this
way they get much more enjoyment out
of the feast than If they had been com
pcllod to dine In public.
KING EDWARD'S METHOD.
King Edward's Maundy is distribut
ed among the poor at Westminster Ab
bey to the accompaniment of an im
posing religious ceremonial. His Ma
jesty takes no part In it. James I was
the last English sovereign who per
sonally gave away the royal doles.
That part of the function is performed
by the King's Lord High Almoner, as
sisted by the secretary of his Majes
ty's almonry and various sub-almon
ens. The recipients of the bounty con
sirt of as many old men and as many
old women as the King numbers years.
Last year there were sixty-three; this
year there will be sixty-four. They
are specially selected with reference to
their worthiness and respectability.
â  The monetary gift is supposed to be
determined by the King's age â one
penny for each year â but he would be
a stingy monarch who would restrict
himself to such a meager measure.
The great alms dish containing: the
purses is carried by a stalwart yeo
man of the guard, escorted by a num
ber of other "beef-eaters" in their pic
turesque medieval scarlet uniforms.
Two distributions of alms take place
in the course of the observance. Each
old man is first presented with a purse
containing the equivalent of $11 25;
the women receiving $8 75 each. This
is in lieu of clothing which used to
be distributed among them. On the
second round they each receive a red
purse containing $5 in gold and a
white purse holding $7 50. This lat
ter takes the place of the provisions,
which were formerly given. It con
tains as many pence as the King is
years of age. The coins are specially
minted for the purpose and the re
cipients can sell them, if they like, for
a hundredfold their intrinsic value, _

MADRID. April 15.â The young King

He consented to his projected visit

He talks very freely, not to say flip

ing the opinion that the best match
for him would be not a tame young

leading up to it. In the outset the

citizen actively engaged In the perpet
uation of the history of the State of
her birth, in fact a historian through

that it was the narration of one who
took part in the events of the times.

ited pictures of the Sloat monument as
it will appear when finished. He then
presented a set of these pictures to the
parlor, which were received and gra
ciously accepted by Metta Kugler, the
president, who then called on Past
Grand President Keith for a few re
marks. This lady extolled the
work of the lecturer in the
matter of the Sloat monument
and called attention to the fact
that the first stone contributed for that
monument was from the Native
Daughters of the Golden West, and ex
pressed the opinion that In view of that
fact the monument ought to be un
veiled by a member of the order. The
next lecture before this parlor will be
Riven in May by Miss Keith, chairman
of the committee of promotion, pub
licity and historical landmarks of the
N. D. G. W., and the subject will be,
"The Discovering of California the
Logical Outcome of the India Idea."

Very simply Mr. Van Rooy, who does
most of the talking â Mr. Burgstaller
contenting himself mostly with a boy
ish smile and an occasional "yes" and
"no" â told of the Inevitable difference
in conditions between the performances
at Bayreuth and anywhere else in the
world.
"Before the season there." he said,
"v. <â  rehearse every day for a month,

Tier lived, rehearsing under the eye of
Madame Wagner, and in a theater spe

There Is nothing to distract the eye
from the picture. The music comes" â
Mr. Van Rooy turned to the boyish
face of the Parsifal beside him for in
spiration, and got it â "the music comes
as if from another world."
There was the Bayreuth note after
all. There was the echoing reverence
from that little hilltop from which the
new gospel of music was preached to
the world. One got it again as the
einger continued; "You cannot help
being more impressed there yourself,
and the productions are therefore nec
essarily more impressive. But," he
shrugged his broad shoulders and

"You go back to Bayreuth. I hear?"
I asked him, for so I had heard.
"Yes, next year,' the tenor replied
with very evident gladness.
"The best woman of the world!" he
exclaimed, as I asked him about Ma
dame Wagner. He told me then boy
ishly, quietly joyful, of the reconcilia
tion that had taken place between
them. Last Christmas eve Madame
Wagner had written to her former pro
tege in forgiveness for his sin in sing
ing "Parsifal " for the enemy.
"After all." she wrote to him. "some
one would have sung it. and it was
really better that the Americans should
first know 'Parsifal' through you than
through one of whom I could not have
approved." And so next year Burg
staller goes back to Bayreuth.
"Help, Help!" Mr. Van Rooy's mellow
barytone here sang out. The nosing
was over, and the piano was shoved
back in place again with lauehable
ease and palpable enjoyment. N<>r
did that satisfy Mr. Van Rooy's appe
tite for action. He caught up a massage
machine from the toilet table and ap
plied it briskly to the Burestaller
throat with a etern order to its owner
"to talk for himself. " But he helped
the tenor through his explanations to
me that he had been a watchmaker â
which "was why he was always on
time" â Oh, Amfortas! â at Holzkirchen.
There Lev! the big conductor heard him
sing a little song one day and carried
him off to Bayreuth. Here after a
little study with Stoekhausen he
studied for six years with Madame
Wagner, and has sunp now in "Parsi
fal" for five years.
"You. yourself, Mr. Van Rooy." 1
asked then, "how came you to Bay
reuth?"
"I, too, am a Stockhausen dudlI â
finest teacher in the world.' he Inter
rupted himself to throw this to his
former master. "Oh, I was two years
in concert, singing in Heidelbere and
Frankfort. Madame Wagner's daugh
ter heard me there singing the "Fnre
well of Wotan.' and Madame Waener
wrote a letter to me afterward engag
ing me to sing Wotan. That was in
"SÂ»7. Then I went to London with the
Ring for its first production there.
After ihat here of course."
"Of course?"
"London is the key for New York.
Is it not," Mr. Van Rooy put it
"Have you sung in any other than
Wagnerlan opera?"
"French opera, in 'Carmen,' the Es

Then there are large importations
yearly of paintings of religious themes
to be used in church decoration. Why
not let local people who have attained
a high place in art supply the need?
That Mathews, Tojetti, Sandona and
a few more local men that at this mo
ment escape me, could paint as good
pictures as come from Italy there is no
reason to doubt.

songs-," the barytone added.
"How do you yourselves like 'Parsi
fal' in comparison with the other mu
sic-drama?" I asked.
Mr. Burgstaller smiled, and Mr.
Van Rooy hastened to say that for
himself he liked best â "always, if you
ask me, the last one I have been sing
ing in."
"I wondered," I ventured in all rever
ence, "If before singing in 'Parsifal' you
spend a month or so in the wilderness â
to pray. "
Quietly Mr. Van Rooy said then: "To
sing it is to pray," and I was for all
time answered as to the fashion in
which the singers regard the music
drama.
"Does the applause hereâ l know it is
not allowed at Bayreuth â shock you?"
I asked.
"A little,", ; rather unwillingly, the
barytone acknowledged and added epi
grammatically: "Sometimes you know
there , is no applause greater than no
applause. | But it is â the ; difference â¢in

Hanging up the instrument Mr. Van
Rooy took from the little table beneath
a collection of shells that he had gath
ered on the beach Monterey. He
turned their Iridescent pearl to th^
light for my admiration, and said:
'When I sing no more I come here to
gather shells."
"1 suppose," I ventured then. "I dare
not ask what you think of the right
eousness of bringing 'Parsifal' over
here?"
"Not for publication," the barytone
said. "You see we like to sing here as
well as in Bayreuth, and In Bayreuth
as well as here. Madame Wagner wo
both julmire immensely, of course, Mr.
Courted we, of course, also admire. One
must not say things about either side.
It Is dangerous."
A little more of this and that Wag
nerian and then Mr. Van Rooy asked:
"You have enough now to make a good
story, and If you haven't you can make
some tip â eh?"
"I don't do that," I laughed, but af

MRS. FISKE SCORES
AS A PLAYWRIGHT
A well known New York critic
write as follows on the plays written
by Mrs. Fiske and recently presented
at the Manhattan Theater:
"One of the most marvelously elec
tric, irresistible, gripping, vivid and
artistic little one-act plays that it has
ever been my good fortune to see was
produced yesterday at the Manhattan
Theater. It was called 'A Light From
St. Agnes,' and It was the work of
Mrs. Fiske. It swept its audience so
instantaneously, its appeal to one's
artistic fiber was so strenuous, that a
warm weather audience, inclined to
be lackadaisical, rose and called for
ONK OF EVELYN McCORMICKS HIGH LIGHT PICTURES. A SCENT} IN MONTEItBT. THAT 18 ON EXHIBITION AT THX
ART INSTITVTE. THE CANVAS IS A LIVING REFVTATION THAT JURIES WILL NOT HANG -HIGH LIGHT' FIC-
the author, and then filed out into the
lobby to talk about it.
"It was a play that was strongly
emotional. It was nearly horrible.
One could use that much slandered
adjective 'grewsome.' The end was
murder, the motive was a sacrilegious
robbery, the man was a besotted
drunkard, the woman was his para
mour, the scene was the village of
Bon Hilaire in Louisiana, there were
but three characters in the play. In
spite of all of which it was not morbid.
It was not a cheap bid for theatrical
sensationalism. It was no ridiculous
rhodomontade of dime-novel realism.
It was an artistic gem. If the origin
of every work of art is an emotion,
then 'A Light From St. Agnes' can
claim its place.
"It was so capitally acted, so ex
quisitely stage managed, its appeal
was so dignified yet so overwhelming,
that â well, one couldn't help thinking
that if Frank Keenan had been lucky
enough to secure this prize the Berke
ley Lyceum, now closed (requiescat in
pace!), might have been 'turning 'em
away,' as the rude phrase goes.
"It is impossible to do justice to this
little play on paper. Things that you
Intuitively recognize to be great seem
bald when reduced to diagram form.
Yet 'it would be rank injustice to say
nothing of the story of 'A Light From
St. Agnes' simply because one feared
inadequate description.
" 'Toinette and Michel lived in a hut
in the village of Bon Hilaire. They
were lovely and unlovely. He was wild
and untrammeled and she was scarcely
less so. They lived near the Church
of St. Agnes. She used to sleep on a
bed in the middle of the room, because
a light from St. Agnes shone upon her
and woke her in time t* call Michel.
To 'Toinette came Father Bertrand to
tell her of the death of a woman who
had tried to reform these lawless liv
ers. She had left for 'Toinette, as she
lay dying, a crticlfix! 'Toinette's dark
and dismal nature was touched, but the
advent of Michel, her brutal accom
plice, soon brought her back to reality.
"In the church just opposite, and
from the window of the hut. he could
see the dead woman awaiting burial,
laid out in white cloth embroidered
with gold, and with a diamond cross
upon her breast. As he sat there, be
fuddled, his cupidity grew. He piled
himself with drink. 'Tolnefte lay on
her lowly couch trying to sleep. The
man was restive. There was nothing
to indicate his intentions. But by Mrs.
Fiske's art you realized them.
"He must possess that diamond cross
from the bre-ast of the dead woman.
He would enter the church and steal
it. He would even throw dtrt at the
face of the corpse, for he hated the re
former. But 'Toinette's dark nature
had been impressed. There was the
gift of the crmiflx. Intense loathing of
Michel's contemplated crime seized her.
She struggled with him. A terrible
tragedy loomed. The little Louisiana
hut was for the moment grandiose with
a stupendous conflict between the man
and the woman.
"By a ruse she escapes and gives an
alarm that sends the beiis ringing in a
wild chime. Michel is trapped and he
knows it. He goes and brings back
the woman. He flings her upon the bed
and plunges his knife into her throat.
Then he washes the blood from his
hands. Everything is silent. Every
thing is dark. He steals stealthily
away. Into the utter darkness creeps
the light from St. Agnes. Its rays fall
upon the body of 'Toinette and it is
irradiated. Upon this picture the cur
tain falls.
"Horrible, you say? No. There is
not one needlessly horrible moment.
There is not one hysterical, neuras
thenic moment. It is the very sanity of
sensation. It is absolutely and com
pellingly artistic. The emotions are
laid bare. In long silence much of the
action' is "acted." It is tense and
teeming. It reduced a hard-shell audi
ence to the consistency of a soft shell
clam.
"If Mrs. Fiske had never done any
thing more than this one-act play she
would be immediately recognized as
unusual. Oddly enough, it appears that
about eight years ago at the Garden
Theater two performances of this beau
tiful little play were given. Where were
we all? I never saw it. never heard of
it, and I'm glad of it. as the pleasure of
yesterday would have been denied me.
And it was a pleasure. There is no
joy keener than that given by a fine
play, perfectly acted, admirably pre
sented.
"John Mason. William B. Mack and
Fernanda 1 Eliscu sent 'A Light from St.
Agnes' into history. The three were
uneriticixably excellent. Miss Eliscu.
an ambitious young woman, who hurl
ed herself tempestuously at the stage a
few years ago, has toned down. She
was exceedingly fine. So was Mr. Mack,
an arti.it of apparently inexhaustible
versatility.
"It Is like an anti-climax to talk of
Mrs. Flake's two other one-act plays,
also given yesterday. The first, called
'The Rose,' was neither new nor true,
but it was made interesting by Mr. Ar
liss. The third. 'The Eyes of the Heart.'
was a pretty, sentimental little trifle,
founded upon an Italian comedy. The
idea was the pathetic description of a
blind old man, whose poverty was con
cealed from him. and whose relatives
painted all In rose color. A similar Idea
was worked out artistically in Misa El
len Glasgow's charming novel. 'The De
liverance.' Mr. Arliss again distin
guished himself in this.
"Mrs. Fiske's afternoon with h*r own
plays was so successful that It Is ten
thousand pities there will be so few op
portunities of seeing them. They are
announced again for next Wednesday
afternoon. Those who don't sea themâ
well, they deserve what they get for
their good money at one or two other
houses. Mrs. Fiske stamped herself aa
surely and as indelibly upon this season
by her plays yesterday as she has don*
by her work in 'Leah Kleschna.' "
NOTES OF ACTORS â 
AND THEIR PLAYS
Hemrik Ibsen's play, "The- Master
Builder. " will be presented for a single
performance at a Broadway theater
with a special cast. The proceed* will
go to the fund for the erection of a
memorial window to the late Mrs. G.
H. Gilbert. The idea of the matinee
originated with the younger members
of several old theatrical families who
desire to present this play and to do
nate the funds to some laudable pur
pose.
In his last letter from Paris Augustus
Thomas advises Kirke La 3helle that
he has completed the detailed scenario
of the new play he la writing for Law
rance D'Orsay*s use next season, and
that the first act is finished, dialogue
and all. The locale of the play will be
Washington and D'Orsay will appear
as a member of the British legation.
This is the last season for "The Earl
of Pawtucket."
When Mrs. Fiske closes her season in
"Leah Kleschna" at the Manhattan
Theater, New York, on April 15, M
â¢vent made necessary by Imperative
bookings In other cities entered tnti
long before the production of this phe
nomenally successful play, she and the
famous Manhattan company. Â«
will then undertake a tour including
the Pacific Coast, will have filled a
continuous engagement at the Manhat
tan covering thirty-two weeks, the
longest Mrs. Fiske ever has played
ihere. Of this season at the Manhattan
ten weeks were initially devoted to
"Becky Sharp," while "Hedda Gabler "
was revived for four weeks, pending
the production of "Leah Kleschna. "
which had shown at the Manhattan for
eighteen weeks on April 15. apparently
with its vogue undlminished in the me
tropolis.
A European critic says of the younger
D'Annunzio: 'D'Annunsio Â©ere was
not very pleased at first at the idea
of his son going on the stage. But the
young fellow has a frantic passion for
acting, and the father had to give in
at last. From childhood the boy be
gan to act. and once made quite an Im
pression in the Cicoqulni College of
Prato, when he played in one of his
father's tragedies. So at last D'Annun
zio had to give his consent to the boy
going on the stage, and he is to play
Simonetto in the new play. The Torch
Under the Rushel." Simonetto is a son
of the' hero and brother of Gigiiola
(played by Tereslna Franchlni). Si
monetto is a young lad, only 17 years
of age, and is weak and thin in person.
The part Is not long, but one of great
importance, and difficult to act at the
same time. Friends call D'Annunaio's
son Gabrlelino. D'Annuniio is super
intending the rehearsals of his play in
person."
Lew Fields, the head of the "It Hao
pened in Nordland" company, owns a
fine collie doe: which serves as watch
man at his home on West Eighty
third street. New York. The other
evening an inebriated neighbor of M-
Fields. mistaking the comedian's home
for his own, was bitten by the eolli*
on the left leg. The next morning h*
wrote:
"I demand Sl'XWl for my injuries. I
may suffer from hydrophobia. "
Mr. Fields promptly wrote back:
"My dog Is worth $1500. I demand
that amount of money from you. My
collie is suffering from alcoholism."
No suit against Mr. Fields has as yet
been instituted in the Supreme- Court of
New York.
1920
HOW WE TAKE OUR OPERA
What a fortnight this has been with
our beautiful city in its musical mood
and its glad trappings!
Ah! 'twas a great show of pretty
â¢women and women who knew well the
luscious secret of gauzes and laces, of
Jewels and blossoms and of the witch
ery of â¢ half-undressâ shimmery
shoulders, unflecked save by the sun
burst that gleamed from the warm,
white flesh.
And such colors as showed forth in
that great cavernous opera-house â
the colors of the orchid or of the
rainbow, or the mystical gleams of
the opal. Seen from the proscenium
box, the house was white and pink and
blue, the tints of a summer sky, with
here and there a gleam of red or a
splash of black to lend "character" â
with the white shoulders showing
above.
And the men finished the picture â
the men in their black and white
uniforms, bless them! And they wore
them so easily, so comfortably. Don't
you listen to the misanthrope who tells
you that San Francisco men are un
happy In their dress clothes. It's dis
tinctly a libel and a naughty calumny
upon that part of our population that
escapes provincialism.
As for the white and pink and blue
contingent, alas! â In spite of its beauty,
its clothes, its Jewels, its own estimate
of Itself It is conscious, stiff and un
naturalâthawing only when given a
cue from the man at its side, and then
as if the eyes of the house were watch
ing, watching.
Now, all this was a marvel to me,
since the very maids and matrons
who were woodenest are "easy"
enourh in a ballroom â and wearing
no more clothes either. So the ele
ment of modesty is thus eliminated.
After thinking profoundly over this
very profound matter I am forced
to the belief that the consciousness was
due to the music â to a haunting fear of
betraying a lack of musical knowledge.
During the first "Parsifal" perform
ance this attitude could be felt â it. was
in the air.
Of rourw. I ]oved itâ it was splen
did." said a debutante to me. And I
mad* bold to ask her what part of
"ParFif&l" she liked beet, and why?
What part I liked best?â why, I don't
really know. I think, though, the flow
er maiden scene, because they looked
so pretty."
"'Hush! You iittle psflsW/' whispered
her mother, "didn't Mias F say in
feer lecture that the "motifs ' were the
thlnirs you nhould enjoy?"
But the little maid was honest, Mess
h^r! â she liked the sensuous beauty,
the bewildering mass of mellifluous
music, the kaleidoscope of color, the
luxury* of the ensemble, and was frank
enough to say so. And speaking of this
same scene, it is not in the category
of Sunday school cantatasâ never,
never.
To the undeveloped mind of a young
leirl. the allegory is not strongly
apparent. And were it not for th* mas
terful music that accompanies this
manifestation of elemental passion. I

cannot *eÂ«> it in any other light than
Ibpenesque â that is, as far as the un
developed mind of the young can
grasp it
A strange phase of the season was
the disinclination for the women to
visit about â to wander in the balcony,
and unlimber a bit.
V'hy. here is the splendid, joyous
thing of the Metropolitan Opera-house
âthis wandering about 'twixt acts.
It eivof- atmosphere to the opera, Just
as the breath of the rose adds to its
beauty. However, it's a long cry to the
Metropolitan â so we're not too terribly
to blame for a few provincialisms.
However, we must begin to outgrow
our consciousness some day.
It's all a matter of clothes â this lack
of ease.
And while on the subject, what can
be offered in extenuation or palliation
of the grabbing of wraps and the bolt
ing for the door that has marred every
"last curtain" of the opera? The fact
remains that the curtain had scarcely
touched the floor than a scramble was
made for wraps, but to the everlasting
credit of the upper floqrs be it said
that there the discourtesy was less ap
parent.
Ask of yourselves if this be kind â
kind to the artists who have given of
the bf.st of their bodies and of their
souls? How that haste must have
chilled them!
The whole matter rests upon our

He crosses the ocean on the same
steamer on which the Conrled people
return to sunny Italy. Won't that be
a voyage worth while to the young
sculptor?
Miss Eleanor Conneil's talk last Tues
day morning drew a lot of interesting
people, who were more anxious about
the themes of "Parsifal" than about
what they should wear to the perform
ance. That the listeners were able to
hear its expounding from the lips of
one so well equipped as Miss Connell
was a privilege, her personal remi
niscences of the Bayreuth presentation
being the neatest discussion we've had
during the "Parsifal madness.
At the piano was Mrs. Fannie Meyer-
Ellis, whose playing of the important
motifs rounded the oral descriptions.
Miss Connell has been asked to repeat
the lecture in several private drawing
rooms, likewise in Oaklandâ even the
Oaklanders are afflicted with Parsi
falis.
The Carnival of Nations in San Ra
fael, for which there is much elaborate
preparation, will take place on May 20
in the grounds of the Mount Tamalpais
Military Academy. Many brilliant fea
tures will characterize the affair â
booths of varied contents, military
drills, a horse show will all have a
place.
With troubadours and masquerad
ers, a general carnival spirit will
reignâ if the clouds don't; and. besides
all this splendor, permission has been
obtained to produce "Alice in Wonder
land," to be given both afternoon and
evening. The grounds are ideal tor
such an affair, with their spreading
oaks luring the lover of nature.
A special guard of honor, detailed
from the Cadet Corps, will be on duty
to do all sorts of nice things â particu
larly for you, little maiden.
The undertaking is being directed by
Mrs. Vincent Neale, with the patronage
of many public spirited women, among
whom are Mrs. William Babcock, Mrs.
John F. Boyd, Mrs. A. W. Foster, Mrs.
Gerstle, Mrs. George T. Page, Mrs.

AMERICAN WOMAN GAINS ,

Mrs. Butler Dean Wins Admiration
â¢ fat England ; During the
Hunting Season.
LONDON. April 15.â Mr. and- Mrs.
Butler Dean of Washington and New
. York, who . for the last t five months
i have occupied the charming old-fash
1 toned place known as the Manor House
J at Leamington, about 100 miles north
I of London, will soon return to Amer
ica. Leamington is one of England's
health resorts, and Mr. and* Mrs. Dean
have taken every advantage of .what
I' it can provide In this respect. They
| visited the sea daily and partook of
: the waters â  regularly. . But what -more
than anything else induced them to
-prolong their stay, there Is the - fact
that Leamington during the hunting
season is the center of fashionable
England.
Mrs." Dean is an enthusiastic follower
of hounds and a fearless rider. In stat
ure she is short and has earned from
j her hunting friends the description of
j "the little American woman who rides
with the Judgment and intrepidity of
a -. steeplechase jockey."' She would
j put her horse to any fence in order to
!be in the ' first flight close behind the
hounds. Since the commencement of
the hunting season she' has not missed
I a single engagement, and now. when
the actual season is finished,, she is
frequently out with small local hunt
ing parties.

FACTORY BLAZE
LAID TO RATS
Five -Story Brick Building
on Corner of Pacific and
Front Streets Is Damaged
LOSS OF STOCK IS HEAVY
Most Extensive Sufferer Is
Crown Paper Company, the
Fire Starting in Its Place
X fire entailing: considerable loss
broke out yesterday morning In the
business portion of the city. A second
alarm was turned In, but through the
splendid work of the firemen the flames
were kept from spreading to adjoining
buildings.
The building damaged is a large five
story brick structure at Front and Pa
cific streets and is occupied by the
Standard Biscuit Company, the Crown
Paper Company, the Gulf Bag Com
pany and A. Zellerbach & Sons. The
fire started In the factory of the Crown
Paper Company, on the fourth floor. It
was first discovered by Henry Mitchell,
an employe of that firm, at 6:46 o'clock,
when he went to open the place. He
turned in an alarm from box 364, and
the second alarm was turned In a few
minutes later.
Owing to the Inflammable nature of
the stock the fire burned fiercely. Pow
erful streams of water were poured into
the blazing furnace and the flames
were confined to the second, third and
fourth floors, all occupied by the Crown
Company. This company had a stock
valued at $40,000, and the loss Is esti
mated at about one-half that amount.
A. Zellerbach & Sons, who use the
basement for storing paper, had stock
valued at $20,000, which was badly dam
aged by water. The Standard Biscuit
Company estimates ijs loss at about
$2000 damage by water. The Gulf Bag
Company sustained no loss. The build
ing was damaged to the extent of about
$2000.
L. Schwabacher, manager of the
Crown Paper Company, is of the opin
ion that the fire was caused by the ex
posing of electric wires by hungry rats.
Paste is largely used in the factory,
which attracts the rodents, and they
gnaw the Insulation off the wires.
EXEMPTION APPLIES TO
EVERY HOUSEHOLDER
Attorney General Says All Owners of
Personal Property May Enjoy
Benefit of New Law.
In response to an inquiry from the
State Board of Equalization, Attorney
General, Webb has rendered an opinion
construing section 10"^ of article XIII
of the constitution, recently added
thereto, as exempting from taxation
the personal property of every house
holder to the amount of $100.
After defining a householder as "a
master or chief of a family; one upon
whom rests the duty of supporting
and governing the members of a
household; one who keeps a house,
etc.," and after citing the code sec
tion which declares that "every kind
of property that is not real is" per
sonal." and the authorities which lay
down the rules for the construction of
statutes granting exemption from taxa
tion, the Attorney General says:
' "Under the foregoing authorities I j
am inclined to the opinion that the ;
words 'personal property' are used in j
the ordinary sense, as, generally under- t
stood and defined and would include
any personal property owned by the
householder. The constitutional pro
vision has limited the persons to â¢
â whom this exemption is granted to
householders and has limited the
property to 'personal property.' but, in j
my opinion, under the language of the !
constitutional provisions, the limita
tion does not go further, and an art
tempt to again restrict the term 'per- !
sonal property' by reading Into the j
amendment the words 'household I
property' in their stead would be a {
strained construction, while a strict j
construction would be answered by i
holding that it was limited j
to the personal property of the I
householder. If the Legislature had j
intended to exempt the personal prop
erty of a householder, I do not see
what better term could have been em
ployed than the one actually used,
but. If it was the intention to include
household property only, it would have
been an easy matter for the Legisla
ture to have so expressed it by using j
such words.
"I take it that the intention of the
Legislature was to exempt household
ers owning personal property not ex
ceeding in value the sum of $100 from
the payment of any tax, but the
language Is so broad that, in my opin
ion. It grants to every householder the
right to have exempted $100 worth of
personal property. â¢ * * lam of
the opinion that a taxpayer who is
the head of a family living in a fur
nished house or rooms, and having
other personal property than furni
ture, is entitled to the $100 exemp
tion."

Two Porto Rican Burglars
Who Were on Probation
Given Five - Year Terms
Five prisoners were sentenced by Su
perior Judges Dunne and Lawlor yes
terday. Louis Piper, a colored man,

Judge Dunne to serve nine years in
Folsom Penitentiary. He protested
loudly against his sentence, saying he

night of January 11 Piper and another
colored man, who escaped, met Frank
Slgnoriello, a miner from Nevada, who
asked them if they could direct him to
the Roma Hotel, on Sansome street,
where he was stopping. They led him
to an alley-way, where they 'throttled
him and took $500 and two money or
ders from his pockets.
rteorge Gross, who pleaded guilty to a
charge of attempt to commit burglary,
was sentenced by Judge Dunne to serve
one year In the County Jail. On thÂ«
nlght of December 2 Gross broke into

THE FARMERS' CASE.
A('< IRRESPONDENT present the case of the farmer from the
-' the farmer's wife. It amounts to this, that the
claims the same consideration in the press that is ac
he community, and claims by right of
Siting t.> his industry that arc put forward
these is winter irrigation, the pro
ater in the ground when water is plentiful, for use
n when water is scarce.
â  g that when we consider many things in physics
find that knowledge of them was propagated by
of American journalists. Horace Greeley. Western
dry country. It is now filling up with settlers because
what is called "dry farming" is introduced there. It is put forward
f Mr. Campbell, and he is entitled to the credit of
nstrating that it is a practical system, and can be relied on to
ps. It has added square miles to the habitable regions
< I Kansas and Nebraska and Eastern Colorado. But it is nothing
than water storage in the ground.
eeley's Farmers' Column in the Tribune taught it all more
than thirty-five years ago. The rural readers of his paper learned all
about stirring the surface of the ground to make it penetrable by
then stirring it again to supply a mulch that prevents evap
oration. Water penetrating the ground comes to the surface again
by c; attraction. This is why a chip or board lying on the
5 damp on the under side. The moisture has come up from
-less its evaporation is prevented by the chip or board
s into the air again arid is lost. If the surface is stirred the
â¢ing mulch performs the same office as the chip or board, and
the : is arrested for the use of trees and plants. Now,
farmers even bef< ley taught the philosophy of it, knew this.
They pat a mulch of barnyard litter around their trees. They noted
that the I i their hay and grain sacks molded from moisture
â¢ came from below and not from above.
AH this knowledge pointed to the physics of ground storage of
ture, or what in the arid regions we call winter irrigation. Where
;rface is covered with a perennial green crop, like alfalfa, the
foliage performs the function of a mulch, and conserves ;he
The Call has been preaching this for years in dealing with
grazing land question. We have shown that when the arid graz
.nds are stripped of forage plants by overstocking, the water
July penetrates the soil, and rising by capillary attraction,
'â eing arrested by the surface cover or mulch supplied by
â  vapofates and the desert takes the place of the meadow.
The farmer's wife who writes us says that farmers should learn,
v don't see what they want, to ask for it. This is wise and its
practical application to irrigation is this: In the rainy season when
supply of water is abundant, the irrigating ditches are empty. If
â¢ can be used then for winter irrigation and ground Storage,
r the law or the custom governing its price, if its ownership be
ct from the land, should compel it to be supplied at a less rate
than in the summer, when every irrigator wants it at the same
time and the supply is frequently so stretched over the demand as to
crops. This is one thing the farmer wants but does
Bee and therefore he should ask for it. Another thing he wants
is a farmers' club in every community.
The State Board of Trade, in a way. is a State Farmers' Club.
Itvhandles the statistics of crops, exports and prices, and as far as
they willingly co-operate brings the producers together. In this
way it does the same work as the old American Institute in Xew
York City, formed by such men as Mapes and Solon Robinson. Fol
ng its lead every village in New York had its Farmers' Club.
osed of actual practical farmers who met at stated periods to
rt their experience, compare notes and exchange knowledge.
This system extended westward with the settlement of the country.
f these Farmers' Clubs sprang the system of Agricultural
and finally rose the United States Department of Agricul
utd the recognition of rural industries by giving them a seat in
''resident's Cabinet. " '
There may or may not be a lull now in these simultaneous in
tellectual activities of the rural community, but the fact remains
that no industry, without combination or associated organization,
<- ffected as mighty results as the farmers have compelled iti
the years.
What we have desired to impress upon them is the value of
'i the same lines. If they do not ask for what they
want they will not get it. If they want mobile labor to save their
and are terrified when a metropolitan newspaper
tells them it is better their crops should rot than that they should
have the labor to harvest them, they see what they want and arc
afraid to ask for it. If the farmer's wife and daughters part with
the health and pleasures of life under household drudgery, because
they are denied the service of those who would relieve them, let
them ask for what they want. Then they can secure leisure to read
k from the school library and for the enjoyment of that socia
bility which is necessary to a contented life.
When we call the farmer king, we refer to his latent potentiality.
If he cho ise his power and live up to the full pride of his
calling, he will march in the van and not in the rear. He and his
his daughters should not be content to read the city paper
only, with its record of crimes and sports and the smart set. They
should ddrrmine to show that the country has a smarter set than all.
The lady whose letter we have published has made a beginning.
She Â«hows the engineers that farmers knew that water runs down
hill before they were told of it by the profession. She has brought
a differential rate in the price of water for winter
tion and ground storage, and we have no doubt that if she and
eak their minds and think in print more than they do. the
c of the city, the politicians and the statesmen of the country
â¢ that they can usefully go to school to the farmers.
MALE TEACHERS WANTED.
THE Normal School Boards deprecate the lack of male students
in training for the teaching profession. In the San Jose Normal
re are 400 women students and 4 men! This disproportion
of great in all the Normal schools. Educational officers are
locking around for a reason for this. They need not look far. With
ish or agency of their own the pay of women teachers has
fallen below the salary that men will accept.
A man wants to enough to marry, make a home and rear a
family. It is in teaching as in every vocation that -is open to women.
soon a* the woman appeared, though able to give exactly the
KW "^ a* a man. it has been assumed that she could exist on
W^ p*3 This applies to private as well as public employment. It is
injustice, but has come to be established by common consent.
aken by a woman the pay is lowered. If a woman's
a man the pay is raised, though the service and fidel

'â â¢<?* this system has so involved the schools that men have
pra< red from the teaching profession.
-\rc\ point in their school experience pupils require the
me of a male teacher. As in families, man and woman, father
hare in the training of children, so man and woman
2.r> needed as teachers. The best results are impossible without this,
re suffering as a consequence. The injustice to
I teachers is not of their seeking. They are the victims of a
j . and the evil is passed on to the rising genera-
officers want to know how to
h. There is only one way. Raise the pay of
and keep raising it until it reaches the level of a
pay. There is no other way. and this will do justice to women
and restore the proper balance of the sexes in the schools.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. APRIL 16, 1905.
THE SECOND REFORM MOVE.
THE first action looking to a betterment of the city government was the formation of the Com
mittccof 250. Tts work Jims been quietly done and its effect is seen in the second action
Friday nighl in the Republican County Committee. The far-seeing push prepared to use that
committee us an instrument oi its purposes. Tho committee was constituted in 1903. In 1904,
tindtertne uuise of giving it greater working strength for the national campaign, auxiliary mem
bers were added to it in sufficient number to control it.
The subtlety of the push and its ability to get covertly what it wants are shown by the fact
that the member of tho committee who introduced, by request, the resolution for the auxiliary
members admits thai li^ did not know that he was being used for the purpose which soon became
apparent. On Friday niirht lie was foremost among those who favored undoing the act that was
Ims<ml on liis own resolution. The annulment was voted by a large majority, and the auxiliaries
<>i" the i>ush v><Te sloughed off and dropped, with no regrets on the part of the members who
seemed determined that the committee should be above suspicion.-
The Committee of 250 is a voluntary and advisory organization working within party
lines, to make the party the instrument of civic reform. It has no official authority and its
jurisdiction is limited to an appeal to the party conscience and pride. But its position in the
affairs of the party and the city is not to be measured by its lack of official authority. Its advisory
function is respected in proportion to its disinterested desire to make its party's action worthy
of the support of every citizen who wishes this city to have the best municipal government in the
Tnion.
It was believed by enthusiasts that the new charter, operating automatically, would do
this. They thought that government consisted of so many chapters and verses of fundamental
law and that nothing more would be needed. But the old truth, and a myriad of past experi
ences, are proved again. The test of a government is not its fundamental law t its charter or its
constitution. The test is its administration. As far as the charter made people think that its
printed pages were all sufficient, it has done harm by withdrawing public attention from a proper
oversight of administered government. Form and administration are two entirely different
things. The worst possible form of government may be the most beneficial to the people by
prudent and upright administration. Bagdad had probably a better government under Haroun
al-Rashid than European kingdoms had under contemporary Christian monarelis. Granting
that the charter is the best form of government we have had, excelling the consolidation act
which it superseded, its maladministration is believed to have given us the worst government
the city ever had. A book could be written to record the novel and ingenious grafts that have
been found possible under a charter which was intended to prune our government of evil.
It was first necessary to convince the people that, even with a perfect charter, eternal vigi
lance is the price of good government. To enforce this is the function of the Committee of 250.
That it is making the intended impression seems to be proved by the expnrgation of the County
Committee.
While that was being done an apology for the city administration was being submitted to an
audience in a public debate. The apologist, well trained in the art of persuasion, and with a
quiver full of the arrows of rhetoric, and a master of invective and epithet, devoted himself to
a defense of his client at every point of attack. Coming to that action which reveals the character
of the administration completely, the retention in the presidency of the most powerful munici
pal board of a man indicted for a felony, the apologist rose to the occasion. He declared that
the president of the Board of Works, ''when his trial comes, will be acquitted," and for that
reason he is retained in office.
Now here is a man indicted by an unusually intelligent and faithful Grand Jury, upon evi
dence believed by that body and its official legal advisers to be sufficient for conviction. One of
its principal witnesses against him admitted that he was promised money to leave town. Subse
quently he did abscond, quitting a profitable employment and avoiding regular methods of travel
so as to cover his tracks. The foreman of the Grand Jury employed private detectives to follow
and find him. lie was brought back, detained in jail as an absconding witness in a felony trial,
and is now on bail, held for his appearance when the case is called. Immediately upon all these
events we are told by the professional apologist for the administration that this indicted president
will be acquitted!
Is it an evidence of innocence when witnesses against an indicted man slink away between
two days and have to be kept in the grasp of the law to secure their appearance? A fit sequel to
this apology will be a declaration that if this witness forfeit his bail and go beyond the jurisdic
tion of th c court, if will be ; proof positive of the innocence of the man most interested in his
disappearance.
While this statement illuminates the whole apology and its object, it is a warning cry to ;
tlie prosecution. It reveals a set purpose to an acquittal at all hazards. It means that the
whole energy of the administration is to be thrown into the sophistication of evidence and the
fixing of a petit jury. Let this be remembered. It is evident that an acquittal is to be had, if
possible, no matter by what means, because the administration casts its lot with one of its mem
bers who is iiulictorl for a felony. It is in the same boat by its own act, and by this public de
claration. Its stake iÂ» enormous, and will be won if craft, crime and cunning can win it.
LIFE NEED NOT BE HUMDRUM
HAVE faith In your golden moods.
Train yourself to expect them.
Look upon inspiration as some-
thing to which you have a right,
just as you have a right to oxygen and
sunshine. *
We mortals are so accustomed to
emphasize our limitations that we have
come to regard inspiration as the ex
ceptional thins instead of the natural
condition it was intended to be. We
all want it. There Is probably not a
man or a woman who does not feel at
tim^s a deep need <>f th" stimulation
and refreshment that come through
moods of joy and exhilaration.
There is scarcely a human being who
does not look back wistfully upon some
gleaming hour of gladness in tho past â
a period of ma^ic which came swiftly
and unexpectedly and vanished in the
same unaccountable way.
To some this glimpse of glory has
come more than once, but to all it is
a rare and unusual experience â an ex
perience which is treasured in the
memory as so much spiritual gold.
And we sigh lor more gold, as if, in
deed, the source from which this came
had been exhausted. How ignorant,
how foolish we are! Always fearful
that the thing we want is not ours.
Always doubting the existence of the
infinite reservoir from which we may,
if we will, draw all the inspiration and
the good we desire.
The secret of inspiration does not
consist in reaching and striving after
tome elusive condition withheld by
grudglns fates or powers, but in sim-

during their brief interview that after
noon, that he was Robert Chilton's
heir.
"The estate consists of this old house,
which haa been in the Chilton family
for a hundred years, and 160,000 in
stocks and bonds," Mr. Blackstone had
said.
"And it's mine, really mine, to do
what I pelase with?" Dick asked
eagerly.
"Nobody can dispute your legal right
to it," was the stiff response. "Chilton
took car* to make a will that would
hold. The Justice of the bequest is quite
another thing."
Although three hours had gone by
since then, Dick still almost doubted
his great fortune. How often he had
gone with empty pockets and nothing
to eat!
One blissful thought made his heart
leap. He could marry Alice Dale! They
had waited two years because of their
poverty; there was now no occasion for
delay.
The wind whistled around the house,
driving great gusts of snow against the
windows. Dick laughed at its futile rage
and stirred the fire afresh. In fancy he
saw Alice sitting on the other side of
the hearth, one pretty pink cheek in
her palm. How graciously she would
rule over the house! He would hasten
to her the first thing on the morrow
with the wonderful news.
The door bell rang. Mr. Robbins, the
gray-haired minister who had officiated
at Robert Chilton's funeral that day,
was ushered in. Shaking the snow from
his great coat he sat down heavily be
fore the fire, his face wearing a stern
expression.
'Mr. Vance, how long had you known
the deceased?'" he abruptly inquired.
"About six months, sir."
"i'ou met abroad?"
"Yes. sirâ in Paris. Mr. Chilton fell
seriously ill at one of the hotels. He
was plone and I took care of him. He
was pleased to think that my nursing
saved his life."
proa traveled with him afterward?"
"I did. I was a poor medical student.
I had just taken my degree. I could act
as courier and also keep careful watch
over his bodily health."
Dick smiled pleasantly, but the cler
gyman's face grew harder than before.
"Did he ever speak to you of his fam
ily?"
"Only onceâ just before he died. He
said they had betrayed, forsaken himâ
that he was worse than alone in the
world. He made me promise to bury
him from his old home, never intimat
ing that I was to be his heir. That
came as a complete surprise. Oh. sir,"
Dick added, with kindling eyes, "this
legacy means everything to meâsuc
cess, happiness, a prosperous career."
Looking at the young man over his
spectacles, Mr. Robbins said gravely:
"Then you are not aware that Mr.
Chilton left a daughter and a grand
daughter?"
Dick turned pale and all at once there
was a curious pounding in his ears.
"No! It simply can't be! He would
have told me "
"It seems that he did not. His daugh
ter married against his wishes and he
never forgave her. She is now a widow,
a confirmed invalid and very poor. Her
child, a girl of twenty, is working be
yoni 1 . her strength for the bare neces
sities of life. I sent word to them, but
it appears they did not receive it in
time to come."
There was a silence which neither of
the two seemed disposed to break.
Dick's ;; forehead glistened with per
spiration. He swept a shaking hand
across it.
"Of course I understand why you
tell me this, " he cried huskily. "You
think I have no right to the property,
and should give it up!"
The old minister frowned and was
silent. Dick glanced llngeringly around
the room.
"I won't do it!" he cried, with half
angry vehemence. "If Mr. Chilton had
wanted his daughter to have it he
would have left it to her. It's mme â
mine! I intend to keep it!"
Mr. Robbins rose and picked up his
hat from the table.
"I regret exceedingly your decision,"
he paid coldly. "Frankly, I'm disap
pointed in you. Good night, sir." And
he walked out of the room.
Dick sat for a long time gazing into
the fire. His cheeks were flushed. The
discarded daughter was nothing to him.
He would be a fool to abdicate in her
favor. No doubt she deserved all that
had befallen her, and even worse.
Presently his thoughts turned to
Alice. She had forbidden him td write
to her. He should be free, she had
said, since they would be unable to
marry for years. If ever. Not a line
had passed between them for months.
But he felt no misgivings. She loved
himâ she would remain true.
"How I wish it were morning that I
might go to her," he. said aloud.
He smiled, and yet a heaviness lay on
his heart. The sad face of the woman
whose birthright he had stolen seemed
to stare at him reproachfully from the
corners of the room. It eveÂ» framed
Itself In the logs' as they
blazed up fitfully and fell apart.
The doorbell rang again. After a long
delay the door opened to admit Mr?.
Burke, the old housekeeper. She was
pale with suppressed emotion.
"Another visitor?" he exclaimed with
annoyance, "Who is It?"
"Mr. Chllton'p granddaughter, sir,"
was the startling response.
Dick sprang to his feet.
"The poor child did not learn of her
grandfather's death until to-day, sir.
The storm delayed the malls. She came
at onee â and alone, because her mother
is 111."
"What does she want?" His voice had
a strangely harsh, unnatural sound.
"She hoped to be in time for the
funeral, but her train was stalled. She
is going right away again. I thought,
sir," hesitatingly, "you might like to
see her first."
See her! Dick felt a sick shrinking
through all his being. Of course it was
a game to wheedle some concession
from him. But it would be churlish t->
refuse.
"Where is she?"
"In the kitchen. She wouid come no
farther."
As Dick started in that direction Mrs.
Burke laid her hand upon his arm.
"One moment, sir. I'd like to tell
you something. The girl loves a wu-rthy
man as poor as herself. They ran
never marry now. I'm sorry for them
both."
She turned half fiercely, but before
he could speak his anger was swal
lowed up in pity. The ease appealed
to him strongly. Was the structu
his happiness to be built upon the ruin
of two lives? If he robbed this girl of
her inheritance what was left to her?
With these thoughts whirling In his
â¢'IHck! Dick!"
brain he started on again with heavy,
shuffling steps. The girl sat before the
kitchen flre, her face In her hands.
Dick saw the drooping figure as
through a red mist. He began speak
ing rapidly, in a tense voice, as if half
afraid to trust himself.
"I'm a selfish brute. At first I didn't
realize the Injustice of accepting a
legacy that means everything to
you "
At his first word a tremor had shak
en the bowed figure. She lifted her
head suddenly with a startled exclama
tion.
"Dick: Dick.'"
He stood staring. All at once the
mist seemed shot through with a daa
xling light. He leaned nearer, like one
half blinded, and brushed his hand
across his eyes.
"Alice! It is Alice?" he said Incredu
lously.
She, the quicker to grasp the situa
tion, looked up at him with a happy
laugh.
"Dick: Oh, Dick! Xobody told me
the name of the man who had robbed
me of my birthright. I never dreamed
it was you. I thought It was s</me ad
venturer. That fs why I meant â to go
away â without seeing you "
The words died in an inarticulate
murmur. Her blushing face was
pressed against his heart.

HENRY JAMES, the accom
plished novelist who is now
giving us by his sojourn in
our State another chance to
impress him .so favorably
that he will leave the land
of his adoption and come back to
us to be an American by choice
of life as well as he is by chance of
birth, has to his credit one of the most
noteworthy of the many enthusiastic
sentences which have been written In
appreciation of Robert Browning. It
comes to us as the motto for /he best
chapter In the new boot, "Robert
Browning," by C. H. Herford, profes
sor of English' literature in the .Uni
versity of Manchester, Just at the time
Mr. James visits our city; and the coin
cidence of his bodily presence here may
Ffrve to" Invoke rememorance of the
coming of his words in that legend's
brief enunciation* by a master of Eng
lish prose of what were those special
Sights of eloquence wherein Robert
Browning is the superlative English
poet.
The motto Is used to prelude the final
chapter of this new book â the one
which sums up the study of Brown
ing's life and mind and art in the con
sideration of him In that sphere of
v. â¢rk wherein the great man was at his
greatest, namely, as "the Interpreter of
life." The praise of a master by a
master le what we must heed and try
to remember, and here Is the clever
novelist's estimate of one of the most
soul-uplifting poets:
"His voice sounds loudest and also
clearest for the things that as a race
v.c like best; â¢ â¢ â¢ the fascination
of faith, the acceptance of life, the re
fpect for Its mysteries, the endurance
t-f its charges, the vitality of the will,
the validity of character, the beauty of
tction. the seriousness, above all, of
great human passion."
This new book is comparatively brief
f iering the magnitude of the sub
ject. It does not claim to be the last
word on Browning, but Is only a sup
plementary study of him from a more
definitely literary standpoint than of
i me others of the modern ones which
look out philosophically upon the man
and his work. It makes no pretense â¬f
biographical completeness, but Is an at
tempt to sift out the really salient ma
terial. As to the question of Browning's
1 obscurity," the author considers that ]
the problems presented by bis writings !
are merely tough, and will always yield
to intelligent and patient scrutiny, but i
that the problems presented by his
mind are elusive. The work Is divided
into two parts, Browning's "life and i
work," and his "mind and art." The
Ffcond part is subdivided into a study
of him as a poet, and as an Interpreter
of life.
Of Browning as a poet we learn this
curious Item. "I have," he wrote, "such
a love for flowers and leaves that every
now and then in an impatience at
-being unable to possess them thorough
ly, to see them quite, satiate myself
with their scent, I bite them to bits."
This is bringing reality pretty close
to the facetious fiction of the poetic
fancy being fed on a diet of flowers.
Another item is that he found his most i
exultant rapture in Â» clay-modeling;
"nothing," said his wife, "ever made
him so happy before." His love of light
P color is shown by the fact that
of his Imagined women are plo
red with the play of light on golden
like the one whose
â  ems curled Into a sumptuous â¢well of gold,
and wound
About her like a glory Even th* ground
V.'&s bright a* with apUt sunbeams.
In the study of _ that quality of the
poet's work which is put under the
head of "Joy In soul," there !â  a rood
account given of Browning's apprecia
tion of the finer point* In things, the
| delicate shades that make or mar life
L o such an extent that we must ever
tread and speak In some fear lest we
either spoil something, or Just miss
magnifying the little trifle Into a great
delight. Thus telling of Joy and how
It may be sobered "by recalling the
perilous hairbreadth chances incurred
in achieving it," he quotes from "By
the Fireside":
Ob thÂ« little more, and how much It W.
And the little less, and what world * away!
How a sound Â«hall quicken content to bliss,
Or a breath suspend the blood's best play,
And life be * proof of this!
It is. however, as an interpreter of
hat Browning Is bo great, and
this little book is best when it comes

ject Here we are told of the poet's

for the world "with the jny of crea

Professor Herfords final estimate is
that Browning's poetry is one of the
most potent of the influences which
helped to break down the ml6chievous
distinctions between the "sacred" and
the "secular." and set in its place the
division of the man enslaved by me

JOINT AUTHORSHIP
BY MAN AND WIFE
Joint authorship in fiction-making
Mrain has a test of its effectiveness to
promote success In the two new novels,
"The Princess Passes," by C. N. Wil
liamson and his wife, and "Return," by
Alice McGowan Cooke and her sister,
Grace. As a^method it might be
imagined to be both stimulative and
corrective to composition, somewhat
as conversation multiplies Ideas and
worde as they redound from mind to
mind, or like the balls in tennis as
they rebound from player to player
and so keep up the racket. Certain
classes of light work could surely be
done to advantage by such interplay of
mutual suggestion, emulation and
alternate catch upon the opportunities
each brain brings to the fore; but
probably no important work requiring
complete unity in its designing could
be thus wrought, for the finest thing?
come in too nebulous form to the
brains which first dream and then do
them for the plan to be explainable to
any co-worker, however sympathetic
and Intuitively perceptive. Our minds
and hearts are not yet advanced to that
stage where "thought leaps out to wed
with thought, ere thought can wed It
self to speech."
Whosoever wishes to study the pos
sibilities of this coadjutant fiction
making will find the two stories bright
enough to entertain all the way
through the investigation. No doubt
there is often some fun to the authors
in this method, and as there is an ele
ment of play â a Joy in doing, in near
ly all gfood work, this pleasure wouM
naturally add to the brightness of the
performance.
In the case of 'The Princess Passes"
there is not only the contrast of a man
and a worrtan interweaving their
.thought and expression, but the man
Is English and the woman American:
so there is a double chance for good
guessing at each bright passage as
to which of the co-workers did It.
The story is * sort of continuation
of "The Lightning Conductor," which
pleased so many readers last year. Sel
dom, however, does an imitation either
of others' or one's own work succeed
like the original, and "The Princess
Passes," although goes like the pre
vious ptory in a motor car, is not apt
to make the great run of the former
book.
In the present story. The Lightning
Conductor of Its predecessor, and his
wife, Molly, take Lord Lane, who tells
the tale In the first person, for a. trip
through picturesque Europe In order to
cure him of imagining he loved a wo
man whom Molly said he didn't. Cheer
ful society and amusement, Molly said,
would do it, and it did. However, it was
not so much Just that as it was "the
boy," whose fascinating picture fronts
the first page in the book. Here is the
way in which the first meeting with
him is described by the man whom the
boy cured of his love-sickness for the
woman who had jilted him.
"Food for the gods, and with only a
boy to eat it â but a remarkable boy. I
gazed and did not know what to make
of him. He also gazed at me, but his
look lacked the curiosity with which
I honored him. It expressed frank and
impudent disapproval. Having be
stowed it, he ? nonchalantly continued
hip conversation with the landlady, who
was evidently enraptured with him.
Purely from the point of view of the
picturesque there was some excuse for
madan.es preoccupation. The boy
would have delighted an artist, no
doubt, though our first interchange of
glances gave me a strong desire to
smack him."
However, the man and the boy get to
be great friends later on, and the prin
cess who passes and who is the heroine
of the buck, being the boy's putative
sister and represented to be very like

curious desire to meet her over the
man who became so chummy with her
brother. Out of this, and the mystery
of the princess's passing, from out of
existence Into it, the story is made up.

NEW LOVE STORY
BY TWO SISTERS
"Return" is a love story of the time
of General Oglethorpe's colony, writ
ten by Alice McGowan and Grace Mc-
Gowan Cooke. The scene of it is the
sea islands of the southern coast, and
the chief character is Diana Chaters,
a proud and wealthy beauty, who, in
young womanhood, sowed nettles in
her life's garden, but when matured
by suffering she "trod them down so
nobly, though with bare and bleeding
feet, flung the better seed infco the fur
row, generously and with unfailing
hope, albeit now the season was late;
accepted so humbly the tempest and
useful trouble of the rain, that she
earned the harvest of her fulfilled and
happy womanhood."
There are a number of varied char
acters in the novel, all well drawn.
"Return" is the name of Diana's little
son, and his loss and recovery give the
opportunity for some of the writers
best work. The little fellow Is brought
back by a kindly Indian and his wife,
who, having lost by death their own
child, greatly coveted this "little white
brave," as they called him. The scene
of the mother clasping the little buck
skln-clad boy, with the Indians stand
ing by, stoically bearing their own
grief while they witness the intense
joy of the "paleface" woman on
whom they had bestowed self-sacrific
ing pity, is chosen for the best of sev
eral good pictures with which the book
is Illustrated.
A strong chapter 1b the first one in
the second part of the story, called
"The Book of Returning." It tells of
Diana in distress, lingering by the
seashore and wishing to drown her
self. She is estranged from her hus
band at the time, and she thinks he is
unwilling to acknowledge their mar
riage. There is to this a sympathy
compelling picture of the despondent
woman seated on a rock and the
threatening waves of the sea rolling
up to where she waits, deciding; and
"the sea lay out there. Vague, mys
terious, compelling, it called to her.
Somewhere in its great reaches her
father and her brothers slept."

BOOKS OF POEMS
BY CALIFORNIANS
A little bunch of little books all done
by Callfornians are well worth select
ing from the week's collection of
literary production that claims notice
on this page. Two are books of unpre
tentious verse with many pleasing pas
sages; and three axe compilations skill

words that mind and heart wish to have

One of the books of poems is by Mrs.
Frances M. Milne, the librarian at San
Luis Oblepo. We will only have space
here to mention one of her poems, and

the water from the clouds, the wells
and the streams; and because the cen
tral thought of the poem naturally links
Itself In our minds with one of the
great speculative conceptions which
though beyond the answer of relisrion
or sociology yet deeply concern them,
and which humanity has it in Its power
to answer only by the method of per
fecting Its conduct.
This speculative thought Is that It is
the psychical condition of the world,
the sin of man, which causes the
physical side of the cosmos to be so
marred with mixture of ugliness and
terrible severity. That idea has been
worked oÂ»t and fully expressed by
Horace Bushnell in his "Nature and
the Supernatural." Thus he says: "Wo
see at a glance that given the fact of
sin, what we call nature can be no
mere embodiment of God's beauty and
the eternal order of his mind, but must
be to some wide extent a realm of de
formity and abortion." Of course
evolutionists can deny this by pointing
to the fact that evllÃ in the Dhvsical
world existed long before man's ad
vent; but we must remember that,
granting design, there are two kinds of
consequences, and the second kind are
those which "come anticipatively, or
before the facts whose conseauence
they are." Mrs. Milne's book is called
"For To-Day." Let us listen to some
lines of her poem "The Drouth." and
to the lesson she draws from drouth's
desolation:
No fresh mown hay Its scented Incense yields
From these sad meadows, stricken brown and
bare.
The brook that rippled on Its cummer war,
Shrinks out ot sight within its candy bed.
Defenseless of a oovert from the ray,
Daexllng and pitiless, that beams o'erhsad.

The bee no longer to their sweetness files;
The humming-bird no longer dips his head.

"My Country and Other Verse," and Is
by Robert Whitaker, who has been a
contributor of short poems to the
Overland, Sunset and the Youth's
Companion, and now collects them in
one neatly printed volume. One of the
good ones is called "A Woman'a Wish."
Here are some extracts from It:

that "it's hard to pull up against a cold
collar," and that expression Is ex
plained by the fact that a horse will
much more determinedly balk at a
heavy load after a long rest and his
collar's consequently cold. So Sunday's
rest makes Monday's return to toil
balk-provoklngly blue.
Now, heaven be praised, In this lit
tle book "a specific remedy for each
of these blue-letter days Is provided."
That Is for every Monday In the year
there is a beautiful quotation, the
reading of which at the day's beginning
will drive away the blues and prevent
balking. Now, to-morrow's one of
those blue Mondays, and whoever Is
heeding this notification may experi
ment as to the efficacy of the scheme
by taking the mental medicine provided
for the third blue Monday In April:
Go, make thy garden fair as thou canst,
Thou workest never alone;
Perchance he whose plot Is next to thine
Will see It and mend his own.
âRobert Collyer.
The years are flowers and bloom within
Eternity's wide Karden;
The rose for joy, the thorn for sin.
The gardener Ood, to pardon
All wilding growth, to prune, reclaim.
And make them rose-like tn His name.
â Richard Burton.
Another of the booklets Is called
"Love," and Is a compilation by Paul
Elder of some of "the best that has
been thought and said in the world"
about this greatest of the three highest
things. It wisely both begins and ends
with some of the superlative words
that Saint Paul said about It, and one
of the best sentences in the midst of It
Is this from Addison, "Yea. even the
eternal farewell is robbed of half its
bitterness when uttered in accents that
breathe love to the last sigh."
A third is called "Good Things and
Graces," by Isabel Goodhue, and while
nominally recipes for cookery, is really
a purveying to man of that food needed
from the fact that he cannot live by
bread alone; and thus after telling how
to make "Poor Man's Pudding":
"Equal parts of perseverance and the
best work you can obtain. Pour over
this mixture an abundant supply of
courage. Get up plenty of steam
around this mixture, etc.," we get the
motto to go with it:
O. Dirlne "Worker, what Joy hast thou given
us greater than the Joy of work well done!

GOOD LITERATURE
FOR THE STUDENT
The presence of Henry Van Dyke
among us, delivering lectures in Oak
land and preaching eloquently in San
Francisco, makes It a good time to be
reminded of that excellent "Gateway
Series" of English literature of which
he is the general editor. The books of
this series are neatly bound and con
sist of poems, plays, essays and stories,
all In small volumes, and all with edi
tors chosen because of their "thorough
training and special fitness to deal with
the books committed to them." A
short life of each author Is given, and
a portrait "in order to help the student
know the real person who Vrote the
hook." The aim of the series Is to as
sist those who are beginning the study
of English literature, and to give the
texts required for entrance to college.
For this reason It is called the "Gate
way Series."
Notes are given at the foot of the
pages to explain the hardest words, so
the student need not stop to turn for
the information to a dictionary, and
there are ample notes at the end of thÂ«
books to make clear all difficulties, al
lusions and fine points. The portrait
of Walter Scott In the Ivanhoe of this
series, with the kindly face up Into
which his dog is looking, would be
charming enough to a stranger to
Scott's genius to induce him to read the
book on the picture's guarantee. From
the edition of Tennyson's Princess we
cull from out of the preface by its spe
oial editor, who, fortunately for Ida. is
a woman, Katherine Lee Bates, these
words: "Princess Ida herself, persist
ently put tn the wrong by poet and
Prince, by editors and critica. might
well, like the exasperated wife of Bath,
in Chaucer's poem, turn upon them all
with the question. 'Who peynted the
leoun? Tel me who.' "

York.)
NOTES OF AUTHORS
AND THEIR BOOKS
Mrs. Gertrude Atherton, since her re- i
turn from Europe last November, has
been living In seclusion at the Tavern
of Tamalpais, Mount Tamalpais, Cal.,
engaged in writing a novelette for The
Smart Set Magazine. The story will j
be entitled "The Traveling Thirds" and !
deals with the adventures of a party j
of Americans and an English captain j
who travel third-class through Spain |
so that they may come in closer con- j
tact with the people. In order to get
personal impressions and the proper
local color for this story the author
herself recently toured Spain in third
class compartments and says that she
enjoyed the experience Immensely.
From Mount Tamalpais Mrs. Ather
ton has just arrived in New York,
where she will spend a fortnight put
ting the finishing touches to her nov
elette, and then she will sail for Mu
nich, where she resided for a time, and
where she has decided to make her per
manent home.
The Christian Science Journal, pub
lished in Boston, begins its twenty
third volume with the April number,
and appears in a pleasing new dress.
Its first editor was Mrs. Eddy, and to
this number she contributes a poem
entitled "Whither," and an article on
"Prevention and Cure for Divorce. "
Mr. Kimball's article. "Christian Sci
ence: Its Compassionate Appeal," and
Professor Mosley's discussion of "The
Problem of Evil" are deeply Interest-
Ing. This being the official organ of
the movement, reader* of the magazine
may expect to find in it a correct state
ment of the ideals of Christian Scien
tists. The publishers print in this is
sue a number of first-hand testimonies
from those who have gained through
Christian Science higher ideals of
Christian living as well as health.
E. Temple Thurston and his wife,
Katherine Cecil Thurston, who have
been in Italy for some time, have been
recalled to London to attend rehear
sals for their play, "John Chllcote, M.
P." This is a dramatisation by Mr.
Thurston of his wife's Successful
novel, "The Masquerader," which was
published in England under the same
title as the play. Mr. Thurston at first
endeavored to avoid the difflcultv of
finding two men of similar appearance
by never permitting the two char
acters, Chilcote and Loder, to appear
on the stage at the same time, but
George Alexander, who will play the
part of John Loder, decided that the
strength of the drama would be less
ened and its success jeopardized by
this method. Therefore the scene tn
which the exchange of personalities is
effected will take place in view of the
audience and the dramatic situation
be thus established without doubt or
question. Mr. Alexander was very for
tunate in securing as "double" \V. J.
Thorold, the London editor and man
ager of the Smart Set, who, though not
an actor, has consented to play the
part because of the wonde.rful similar
ity he bears to Mr. Alexander. The
play will be produced in about six
weeks.
A recent dispatch from London says
that Justin Huntly McCarthy's new
romance of the greenwood, "The
Dryad." recently published by the
Harpers, has been produced for copy
right purposes at the Theater Royal,
Margate. The essential qualrty of
Justin McCarthy's romances has al
ways been dramatic and it would not
be surprising If "The Dryad" should
find Its way to the stage, as did "The
Proud Prince" and. "lf I Were King."
It Is Mr. McCarthy's custom to drama
tize his own novels and "The Dryad"
affords material for an Idyllic stags
romance. The setting of the novel be
ing first the heart of the deep woods
and then the glittering court of the
Duke of Athens, very beautiful stage
effects would be possible. Theater
goers would find an unusual and
charming heroine In the person of a
dryad, the last of the Immortals.

In the current Harper's Weekly Miss
Edith Abbott replies to the not uncom
mon assertion that business women,
speaking generally, are failures. One
of the reasons given for this assertion
is the fact that the areragA earnings of
the woman in business are less than a
dollar a day. To prove that this state
ment is unwarranted. Miss Abbott cites
statistics to prove that. In a typical
Industry, the women who received more
than $6 a week constituted 36,961 out
of the 121,443 women employed, or more
than 70 per cent of the whole number.
Incidentally, she notes the surprising
fact that there are more than 5,000,000
women wage-earners in the United
States, of whom less than half are en
gaged In domestic service.

Writing In the April number of the
North American Review on "The Cen
tenary of Schiller's Death." Wolf yon
Schierbrand gives a short but adeauate
account of the career of the Dopular
German poet, and a comprehensive es
timate of. the quality of his work. Ot
Schiller's place in German esteem. Dr.
yon Schierbrand says:
"This is seen by every test. First and
last, millions more of his works have
been sold than of those of any other
German writer. His poems are to be
found in nearly every German home,
however humble, by the Rhine or the
Hudson, the Danube or the MisslsaiDDf.
Schiller's dramas are performed on
every German-speaking stage on the
globe, and they always 'draw.' whether
in Berlin or New York. Quotations
from Schiller are more often used and
more generally understood by Ger
mans than are those from Shakespeare
in the English-speaking world. About
the last things a native German will
forget abroad are the ballads of Schiller
he learned by heart when a small boy.
"The Schiller conception of the world;
his notion of country, home and family.
of love, honor and duty; his belief In
the brotherhood of man. the oneness
of the universe, and the inherent good
ness of the human heart; his Idea ot
divine government â these thinics. with
in a decade of the poet's death, became
part and parcel of the German aoul."

"About a year ago my hands began to crack and peel. I tried

I put my hands in water I was in agony for hours ; and if I tried to
cook over the stove, the heat caused intense pain. I consulted a
doctor, but his prescriptions were utterly useless. I gave him up
and tried another, but without the least satisfaction. About six
weeks ago 1 got my first relief when I purchased Cuticura Soap and

venerable tower, surrounded by luxu
riant masses of wild flowers, will ap
pear an ugly conglomeration of anach
ronisms standing in the dreary waste
of a new made garden and devoted to
the purposes of a cafe and restaurant.
"To the Anglo-Saxon race," says one
â¢writer who has protested too j late
against the destruction of the historic
monument, "Galileo's Tower possessed
a special interest, in that it was the
scene of the classic meeting between
John Milton and the great Italian as
tronomer. Indeed, in the whole history
of science and literature there is no In
cident more picturesque or affecting
than this Introduction of the Puritan
poet, young . and vigorous, with * his
brain teeming with conceptions for his
mighty' epic, to the Florentine sage,
blind, old and persecuted for affirming
the great truths of the solar system." '
Another place of pilgrimage In Italy,
which on sentimental grounds makes a
far stronger appeal } than the '.'Star
Tower" to ' popular imagination,; will
soon .vanish entirely if something Is not
speedily done to preserve what remains
of It. This Is the house in Verona from
the balcony of which Juliet cried, "O,
Romeo! Wherefore art thou, Romeo?"
The mansion is crumbling to ruins and
on the point of collapse. It Is probable,
however, that only the facade of the
building formed part of the original
structure. â  The . arms of the house of
Capulet, however, still brave the weath
er over the entrance grate In the Interior
court, and an Inscription placed there
reads: "This is the house of the Capu
lets, from which sprang Juliet, for
whom so many poets have sung and
tender \ hearts , have wept." ' Though
shoals ' of . pilgrims ' have visited the
shrine consecrated to two Immortal lov
ers, .the shrine . Itself has been put â¢to
strange uses. It has served at various
times as a cabman's â¢ lodging-house, a
restaurant, a warehouse for carts and
a farrier's shop.

SceclaJ Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 15.â Marshall Cllp
thorne, the Chicago millionaire, has
rented a large mansion called "The
Boltons," at Torquay, the most fash
ionable of Devonshire watering places,
and intends to reside there with his
family. Clipthorne visited Torquay
last year and the climate agreed with
him and hl6 family so well that he de
cided to settle there for a time. What
troubled him most was that he found
no school to his liking in the neighbor
hood where he could send his children.
He has sot over that difficulty by en
gaging the services of a local clergy
man who has a reputation for deep
learning in mathematics and the clas
sics, and he has brought over from
New York a man who will look after
his boys in commercial subjects.
Clipthorne says that commercial sub
jects are much neglected in English
schools and colleges, and believing that
success in commercial life depends on
business training he insists that his
boys shall receive it. He told some of
the local teachers that if they taught
their pupils more foreign languages
and less of the ancient tongues> they
would be better equipped to get
through the battle of life.
Mrs. Clipthorne has brought a staff
of American servants over. She ap
pears to be most fastidious with regard
to household work and arrangements
and she maintains that English ser
vants do not understand American
methods.

DODGING WORK
Aversion for Toil Is Due to
Tramp's Efforts to Satisfy
His Thirst for Knowledge
A HUMAN ENCYCLOPEDIA
Arrest of an English Hobo
Brings to Light a Quaint
and Remarkable Character
Sixelal Dispatch to The Qfcll.
LONDON, April 15.â Cursed â or per
haps one should say blessed â with a
strong aversion for manual labor, and
possessed of an Insatiable thirst for
knowledge, William Singleton has gone
through life dodging work and picking
up information. At 61 years of age fame
has been thrust upon him and he has
been acclaimed throughout this coun
try as the "encyclopedic tramp." His
renown came to him unsought through
a brief incarceration in Knutsford jail,
where he had been confined for com
mitting the heinous crime of existing
without any "visible means of sup
port."
The police found In his possession a
couple of memorandum books, In which
in pencil he had recorded a vast
ajnount of statistical information and
out-of-the-way facts. He said that he
had, hidden away, something like a
score of similar volumes in which he
had jottea down all sorts of scraps of
information that he gleaned in the
course of his wanderings. He has a
profound and thoroughly catholic rev
erence for facts and figures. Whatever
they relate to, they have an equal value
in his "estimation. In the books which
were subjected to police scrutiny were
noted, among other things, the exact
heights of the world's greatest giants
and smallest dwarfs; the days and
hours at which all the great Institutions
of London are open free to the public,
the heights of the largest monuments,
the spans of the biggest bridges, the
population of the world's biggest cities,
the number of letters In the Bibleâ
3,671,489 according to the tramp, the
ocean record of every liner and the
time occupied in conveying the mails
from one part of the globe to another.
DIVERSITY OF SUBJECTS.
He was not content with merely crib
bing facts. On one page he had worked
out a calculation from data he had ob
tained proving, to his own satisfaction
at least, that every trip of the Oceanic
meant a return of $35,000. It illustrates
the diversity of subjects in which he
took an Interest that on the next page
he had noted that London consumes
77,133,114,770 gallons of water a year,
and had left a blank space following In

It was found that most of the facts

j committed to memory during the inter
; vals of leisure he enjoyed between his
j foraging or begging expeditions for
i meals. Though he asserted that he val
j ued knowledge for its own sake, he
confessed that he frequently contrived
to convert It into cash. He delighted in
I provoking discussions with cock-sure
j folk who were willing to wager small
j sums or drinks on things they thought
they knew. He had won several pints
| of beer over the question of the time it
took for light to travel from the sun to
the earth. Familiarity with railway
speed records had often earned him
j bread and cheese. And once he had
i made a convivial swell treat him to a
; regular blow-out by proving that hla
i notions as to the relative size of Lon
; don and New York were erroneous. He
i says that he ought to have inherited
wealth and a title. Then loafing would
have involved no disgrace, and as an
"encyclopedic peer" he would be re
garded as a credit to the nobility. "But
as I can't be a belted Earl," he adds,
| "I prefer to be a blooming tramp. That
comes about next to it for a downright
easy job."

was carried by a large majority; Th.=

The solution of the Ministerial crisis
is delayed meanwhile.- The united op
position shows.no signs of weakening
in Its demands of disintegration and
neither does the crown give evidence
of a tendency to withdraw from its
previous utterances or attitude. The
situation consequently is serious, to say
the least. Hungary feels she Is now
combating Austria politically for the
recognition of certain external rights
which mean much to her national ex
istence, and the ; loss of which would
seriously threaten her future independ
ence and lead to a state of affairs be
tween Austria and -Hungary which
Hungary could not accept with tran
quillty. Therefore the Hungarians are
very likely to remain firm, hoping to
force certain concessions from the
crown, each one of which would in
crease Hungarian independence of Aus
tria as well , as ' being ;a â¢ step - toward
ultimate complete Hungarian national
independence. sA ...
It is believed in Tvell informed 'quar

be reached between ; Hungary and the
crown before the address 'comes up for
discussion, thus avoiding possible
heated debates - besides the necessity of

LIST OF MEMBERS
Battle Lines Are
Unmistakably
Drawn.
The San Francisco Republican League,
an organization which stands for
clean politics, a clean iity and a clean
administration, met at Pioneer HaU
last night and elected Ceorje D. c'larlk.
ptrrrraTjent chairman and Daniel A.
Ryan secretary. Of the 300 represen
tative Republicans who were invited
to participate in the meeting, more
than tAvo hundred and fifty were pres
ent.
Shortly after Suclock F. W. Dohr
mar.n announced that he had been re
quested to call the meeting to order,
and he remaiked that he took great
pleasure in complying with the request.
In substance he ttaid:
"1 ask your indulgence to explain
briefly how this movement was created.
A number uf citizens becoming con
vinced that a change in the conditions
c[ dty government would be beneficial,
met and coiiEidfreil the subject. Many
methods were proposed and discussed.
As a result of the deliberations it was
j deemed best to put tin; responsibility
jon the Republican party. A committee
! of three was appointed to create a
larger committee. The larger commit
tee met from time to time and ulti
mately appointed a stilj larger com
mittee, which you gentlemen com
prise."
Reference was made to the remark
of h. censor who spoke of politicians
I Who would be reformers, and reform
'ew who would be politicians. Mr. Dohr
mann did not arrogate to himself the
righi to speak for that large element
of citizenship which was ordinarily in
active in politics, but he claimed that
any citizen wanting honest government
coaM speak for that class. He predict
ed that this movement" for better gov
rrni.ient would have the largest follow
in:? over seen in San Francisco.
"The people," he declared, "are ready
to follow. Art you ready to lead? Do
not mistake the temper of the people.
The 7 demand cleaner and better gov
ernment. Let this movement be one of
anive citizenship and let every man
who joins it resolve to do his duty at
the primary election in whatever sta
tion he may be placed."
Mr. Dohrmann expressed regret that
!â â¢ eouM not be in the campaign him
self, ?s he had made plans for an ex
tended i'.bsence.
Fairfax 11. Wheelan was the first
speaker recognized by the chairman.
Mr. Whoelan, in placing George D.

CALL OF REPUBLICAN
LEAGUE TO VOTERS.
THE San Francisco Republican League, knowing full
well that the citizen's neglect of his political affairs is
largely responsible for whatever o editions may exist in
our city, has taken up the cause of active citizenship, and calls
upon the Republicans of San Francisco to awake to their
civic (iutv.
The San Francisco Republican League is organized in
the interests of a clean city, clean politics and a clean admin
istration.
Our platform is honesty and efficiency.
Our purpose is the redemption of San Francisco.
We' propose to fight organized graft by organized .
honesty. ,
We are well aware that the overwhelming majority of
American citizens desire an honest jjpverntnebt. We heartitv
i,nvite all Mich citizens in every district and every precinct, in
every trade, profession and occupation, irrespective of creed
or station, to join our ranks and work with us actively and
zealously to the end that San Francisco may bd*% city
worthy of its citizens â a city dean, healthful, beautiful and
respected.
A crisis confronts San Francisco. Active citizenship was
never more necessary. No man worthy of the name can re>t
content with the present condition of municipal affairs '-with
out bfcingj at once false to his dty. his manhood and his
home.
All Republicans and all those in sympathy with the aim
and purpose of the San Frandsc* Republican League are
cofdially asked to become members oi the organization.

Belief in Mergers and Whole

roads Is Awakened Again
NEW YORK. April 15.â After yester
day's furious speculation in stocks a
movement to take profits \raa indicated
for -day and it developed, according
ly. Prices ended generally lower than
last night and the transcontinental
group and stocks which have moved
in sympathy with that group are not
the least" sufferers nofwtthstandmg- the
buoyant upshot in the first hour. St.
Paul alone of the group reserved a
meaner gain on the day after having
been at one time more than two points
up. Union Pacific, New York Central
and Illinois Central were also lifted a
point In the early market, but closed
at net losses of more than .&. point
for he two first named and 2^4 for
the last. In the curb market Northern
Securities itself was rushed up to 185%,
but fell back at the last to 181%. > : V>
Tht- whole market centered around
these movements and was not in any
degree responsible to any of the news
opments. A denial by the heads
he Great Northern and the North-
Securitiae companies of yesterday's
rumors of a stock dividend by the for
eompany had no influence in de

OBERLIN, Ohio, April 15.â S. G. Gib
sen, a retail oil dealer, whose sales are
made largely from wagons in the near
by country .districts and who alleges
that the Standard 011 Company has
waged a relentless war against him
with a view of driving him out of busi
ness because he does not buy the pro
duct of the Standard Company, has re
ceived the following letter from the De
partment of Commerce at Washington:
"In a clipping from a Cleveland news
paper, dated recently, it is stated that
during December, on account of your
purchase of oil from an independent
manufacturer, a representative of the
Standard Oil Company warned you not
to buy more oil from that manufac
turer and finally declared war against
you by cutting prices and establishing
competing delivery wagons. Will you
kindly give me full information with
regard to this transaction, stating the
name of the representative of the
Standard Oil Company, the substance
of his statement to you, the prices
charged by that company to retail
dealers before and since and the result
of the reported competition. It is im
portant that the information should be
full and complete.

"was considered wise in time of peace

form of the stock market.
The supposition that the issuance on
Monday of the Supreme Court's man
date for the redistribution of the
Northern Securities stock will be the
signal for the announcement of great
readjustments of railroad relations, and
shows all its old power upon the specu

Governor of Nevada Sends
Physician to Report on
the Prevailing Conditions
RENO, April 15. â The citizens of;
Tonopah have got down to work and
the disease that has been rampant
there is now under complete control. !
All danger is said to have passed.
Such in brief tells the story of the
news that has filtered out from the
mining camp to-day. Reno is filled
with 1 hundreds- awaiting for the offi
cial news to come that sickness is not
prevalent there.
Thus far no official report of con
ditions' have been received. Governor
Sparks this morning delegated Dr. Lee
as a State Commissioner to go Into
the camp and devise such methods as
he deems fit to combat with the j
malady.
The train from the camp, arriving
here to-night, brought out several
carloads of people. The crowds are
not going away, but are waiting in
Reno and surrounding towns until
conditions get better. Fear is gradu
ally becoming less and before many
days It is thought the inward rush will
again start. So far as could be learned
no deaths occurred in Tonopah to-day.
TONOPAH, Nev., April 15.â Reports
published in the newspapers all over i
the coast about health conditions of 'â¢
Tonopah are greatly exaggerated. |
There have been only eighteen deaths
thus far In April; fifteen from pneu
monia with complications, and three
from other causes. There were only
twenty-four deaths in March; eight of
which were from natural causes. The
town Is being cleaned up and disin
fected- The residents are not alarmed,
and business is going on as usual. The ,
false reports emanated from Reno.

behooves us to have the spirit, such as
emanated from Fairfax Wheelan as he
stood upon the platform. Let us hus
tle, work, use every energy, so that
San Francisco may once more raise
and hold her head among the cities that
have dignity, honesty and decency."
John Lackman then proposed that a
committee of forty be appointed to
constitute a finance committee. These
will be named by Chairman Clark. W.
R. Wheeler moved that a committee
of nine be appointed as an organization
committee. The resolution was amend
ed on motion of John D. Daly so that
a committee of ten or more from each
Assembly district be appointed with
power to add to their number at their
own discretion.
Fairfax Wheelan then proposed the
address to voters, which was adopted.
CORRUPTION IS RAMPANT.
On the motion of Clifford McClellan
a committee on platform to be com
posed of eighteen members was left
to the chair for appointment. Follow
ing this business of organization, H.
D. Loveland was introduced and spoke
briefly of the work of reform through
out the history of politics. He said
that all unhealthy conditions caused
agitations for reform and desire for
betterment and that the present condi
tion of civic government in San Fran
cisco must necessarily raise the ef
forts of voters to do away with the
malodorous conditions.
"The methods as to how and when
the voters must do this will depend
uptm their capability and honesty of
purpose," he continued. "The city at
present is infected with graft, dishon
esty and debauchery. The purity of
the ballot has been defiled and there
are men to-day awaiting State'B prison
garb who were weakly prevailed upon
to do the dishonest bidding of a po
litical boss at the polls. It is evi
dent in the attitude of the adminis
tration toward that stalwart Republi
can, Auditor Baehr, who is threatened
with dismissal for supplying funds to
the Grand Jury to aid It in seeking out
corruption, that the honeÃt man has
small room in 3an Francisco's official
life to-day.
"Every man who does not vote is
responsible for these conditions. In
this movement and for It we want men
who will put their shoulders to the
wheel and work. We must endeavor
to get business men as well as the men
in other walks of life."
A. Van der Naillen then followed with
a review of the conditions south of
Market street and told the organiza
tion that the carpenters, mechanics,
machinists and tradesmen were be
ginning to realize that an administra
tion Of graft was the least profitable
for them and that many grim
promises of retaliation at the com
ing elections were heard on all
sides.
A brief discussion arose over the se
lection of a name for the organization.
It was argued that there being already
two Republican leagues that have in
fluenced voters, a third migttf cause
confusion. Fairfax Wheelan spoke
strongly against changing the organi
zation's name, saying that the voters
must learn to vote by the names of the
candidates. The motion to refer the

Dislinguishied Hunter Says
He Has Xo Intention of
Meeting Beasts in Duel
â¢iLEXWOOD SPRINGS, Colo., April
lj- â With some degree of perma
nency. Secretary Locb has established
headquarters here, where he can keep
in as frequent communication as
necessary with the President. A suite
of rooms has been taken at the Hotel
Colorado, a summer resort, which was
opened several weeks earlier than
usual in order to accommodate the
Presidential party. To this hotel all
official mail intended for the Presi
dent will be addressed for the next five
or six weeks. That which must be at
tended to by the chief executive will
be taken to Newcastle by some of the
White House staff attached to the
party and sent by courier to the
Charles Penny ranch, where the hunt-
In* camp is situated.
It is not believed much mail wOl be
received that cannot be disposed of by
Secretary Loeb. Thereafter the Presi
dent will probably be permitted to
enjoy his vacation without being
bothered with the cares of office.
The hunting parfy is about as
isolated as it could be in any part of
the United States. Newcastle, while
easily accessible on the Colorado il id
land, offers little comfort for the way
farer at this time of year. Every peak
surrounding the village is covered with
snow and ihe roads to the southward
toward the Penny ranch are hard to
travel. In addition, the camp is well
guarded, and so large a tract has been
reserved for the President's pleasure
that other hunting outfits would be
turned back if found trespassing.
Colorado newspapers have pub
lished editorials advising that the
President be let alone to en-joy him
self to the utmost.
'Before starting up the trail to the
camp the President told his friends
not to worry if they did not hear from
him for three or four days at a time
as he expected to have something
more to do than write messages.
Helpers at the camp are expected
often to come to the near-by villages
for supplies, and tales of the hunt will
be brought out by them.

NEWCASTLE." Colo.. April 15.â

a majority of the 400 population of

that he does blacksmithing and

fiowever, that the gift of the iron ,
horse was not accepted. j
The run to the village was very
pleasant. Huge bonfires lighted the
way during the night and the inhabi
tants of the town en route stayed up
until far into the morning to cheer
the President as he passed through,
-g up early, the party had its
breakfast of fresh mountain trout on
the train, and, with the '-urtain raised,
viewed the magnificent scenery along
the route of the Colorado Midland.

fine working order and looked over
the horse that had been selected for
hi.s ride to the camp. This animal is
whitf. weighing about 1100 pounds
and is about 14% hands high. It is
said to be one of the most sure-footed
moutnain climbers In this part of the
â¢ ountry, but is not noted for speed.
In fact, all of the horses selocted for
the party are built for hard rather
than fast work.

Before starling the President an
nounced confidentially that he was not
going into any hand-to-hand encoun
ters with grizzlies strangle any
mountian lions with bare hands. He
does not expect to bag a record-break
ing amount of game and will feel sat
isfied if he gets one bear during the
whole hunt and particularly fortunate
if he gets two. His rapid-firing Win
chester was exhibited with great pride
as a protection he will constantly keep
between himself and danger.
TAME ISCAR NOT WANTED.
The parade planned to take place
here to-day did not occur. It had bean
arranged to form a procession led by
the miners' brass band, a caged bear
and the President's party on horse
back. This pageant was to have pass
ed throdgh the village streets and ifto
the hills, where the bear would be
Lurned loose aiÂ»d* given a start of thirty
mile?. Tho State Humane Society
broke up the p;ans on the ground that
the bear mignt. return to the village
and carry off some children. It had
been caged so long that it was quite
vicious. After the humane society had
interfered the captors of the bear tried
to sell it to Gulden Goff and Borah,
out thf.y said they would take their
game wild, domesticated animals hav
ing no attractions for the President on
an occasion of this character.
At 11:15 o'clock the party started at
an easy canter over the hills 4o the
permanent camp of the party, which
is located on East Divide Creek â the
Charles Penny ranch, about twenty
three miles southwest of Newcastle.
There is about a foot of snow in that
section, and bear tracks were seen
there as late as yesterday. "When the
party had gone out of sight the Presi
dent's train was returned to Glenwood
Springs, where Secretary Loeb is to
have his headquarters.

number of the Country Calendar, a
magazine devoted to problems and en
thusiasms of country-loving persons,
Grover Cleveland makes a statement
in defense of hunting and fishing, and
incidentally enters a personal rejoinder
to the accusation that he usea his
sportsman's expeditions as cloaks for
dissipation.
"I am sure that it is not necessary
for me at this late day," writes Mr.
Cleveland, "to dwell upon the fact that
I am an enthusiast in my devotion to
hunting and fishing, as well as to every
other kind of outdoor recreation. I am
so proud of this devotion that if my
sporting proclivities have at times sub
jected me to criticisms and petty forms
of persecution I do not harbor the
shadow of a desire that my steadfast
ness be looked upon as manifesting the
courage of martyrdom. On the con
trary, I regard these criticisms and
persecutions as nothing more serious
than gnat stings.
"Thus, when the short fishing excur
sions, in which I have sought relief
from the killing vexations and perplexi
ties of official duty, have been de
nounced in a mendacious newspaper as
dishonest devices to cover scandalous
revelry, I have been able to enjoy a
sort of pleasurable contempt for the
author of the accusation, while con
gratulating myself on the mental and
physical restoration I had derived from
these excursions.
"Not many years ago I found that
considerable indignation had been
aroused among good neighbors and
friends because it had been said of me
that I was willing to associate in the
field with any loafer who was the own
er of a dog and a gun. I am sure I did
not in the least undervalue the extreme
frif ndliness of those inclined to inter
vene in my defense, and yet at the risk
of doing an apparently ungracious
thing I felt inexorably constrained to
check their kindly efforts by promptly
conceding that the charge was too
nearly truf to be denied."

GUN'S MUZZLE
IS BLOWN OFF
WASHINGTON. April 13. â A tele
gram from the chief of staff of the
North Atlantic squadron received at
the Navy Department to-day states
that the muzzle of one of the eight-inch
guns of the lowa blew off yesterday
during target practice. No one was In
jured.
t The telegram stated that after four of
the eight-inch guns had been fired in
target practice the muzzle of the fifth
gun blew off at the first round. It was
one of the old- type guns of this caliber
mounted on the lowa before the Span
ish war and designed to use brown
powder, and consequently had a much
thinner muzzle than the new type. It
had been fired successfully 103 times
and burst on the one hundred and
fourth time, with normal powder condi
tions so far as known. Several other
guns on the lowa of the same type
made at thÂ» same time have suffered
similar accidents.
This class of guns is being replaced
as rapidly as possible with longer and
thicker tubed weapons. The Navy De
partment has ordered a thorough In
vestigation of the accident.

DOCTORS SURE
BODY IS JONES'
Anthropologist Tells How|
Remains of Great American
Admiral Were Identified !
â¢1
PARIS, April 15.â Dr. Papilaut, the
anthropologist, in an interview to-day
explained the methods pursued yester
day to identify the body of Paul Jones,
found in the old St. Louis Cemetery
after a long search made by Embassa
dor Porter. He says an examination
was made of the teeth, hair, nose and
ears, and they all corresponded with
remarkable precision to the known
measurements and characteristics of
the admiral's organs. The formation of
the frontal bone, the slope of the nasal
bone, the cartilages and ears likewise
corresponded with the measurements
of Moudin's bust made from the life
masks. The measurement of the height
and diameter of the skull corresponded
within a thousandth of a meter, thus
establishing a remarkably exact corre
spondence with the features. â¢
The doctor says his repo*t snakes the
usual reservation covering possible
doubts, although he believes he has
succeeded in assembling so many
pioois as to make the identification in
contestable.
Embassador Porter is receiving con
gratulations on the success of his long
search for the body, which has been
transferred to a new casket bearing an
inscribed plate and having a glass over
the face permitting its inspection.
The extensive work of excavation at
the cemetery has been suspended and
workmen are now filling the lengthy
tunnels.
WASHINGTON, April 15.â The State
Department to-day made public the
cablegram received last night from
Embassador Porter at Paris, in which
he announced that the body of Jo"hn
Paul Jones had been found. The cable
gram described the finding of the cask
et and the identification of the body by
Drs. Papilaut and Capitau, professors
of the School of Anthropology.
Upon the receipt of Porter's dispatch
Acting Secretary Loomis promptly
cabled an acknowledgment and took oc
casion to congratulate Porter on the
success of what appeared to be a dubi
ous undertaking. It is learned that the
Embassador has already expended $1500
of his own money in his long quest. It
is fully expected that Congress will re
imburse him.
Loomis stated that there was no
doubt that the remains of the great ad
miral will be conveyed to America on
a warship^ and interred in Arlington
Cemetery.

PARIS, April 15.â A suit against the

RIVAL NATIONS
TALKING PEACE
Germany and Franc* Begin
Negotiations to Adjust
the Moroccan Quarrel
BERLIN. April 15.â Foreign Minister
Delcasse talked over the Moroccan
question with Prince yon Radolin, the.
German Embassador to France, in
Paris yesterday, thus beginning a di
rect exchange of views between the
two countries. Delcasse opened the sub
ject and therefore the initiative came
from France. Nothing is said at the
Foreign Office here regarding the sub
stance of the interview except that
Prince yon Radolin received Delcasse's
observation in a suitable spirit. The
Foreign Office prefers to make no
statement on the subject, inasmuch as
the French newspapers, even the so
called inspired papers, to-day con
tained nothing from the French Foreign
Office regarding the conference.
PARIS, April 15.â Although the de T
tails are carefully- guarded, there is the
best reason to believe that interviews
have actually taken place between the
representatives of France and Ger
many with the view to removing the
misunderstanding relative to Morocco.
This is not yet announced here, and
the officials do not wish to give too op
timistic an aspect to the situation when
the overtures are yet in a preliminary
stage. However, It is certain that dip
lomatic means have been found to bring
about a mutual exchange of views in
place of the mutual recriminations
which heretofore have been going on.
This favorable turn of affairs appears
to be the direct result of the more mod
erate attitude Germany ha* shown
after communicating with Washington,
London, Rome, Madrid, St. Petersburg
and Vienna.

courages â  the Investors
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, April 15.â Denveritea
and other Colorado residents to the
number of a thousand or more have
paid many thousands of dollars to a
San Francisco concern which is said
to be the Pacific end of a chain of
similar concerns which are collaps
ing throughout the country. The com
pany, known as the American Mutu
al Investment Company, with Colo
rado offices at 212 McPhee building,
has operated here for more than a
year.
The State agent of the concern, F.
O. Brewster, says he has become con
vinced that it is a doubtful enterprise
and is denouncing it to the depositors.
Brewster disclaims any part in the
scheme and represents himself as one
of the victims of the company. He
has resigned.
When first formed, the concern was

BT. PETERSBURG. April In. -The
v eek closeF with the Government's eyes
and hojx-p centered on Vice Admiral
BtvenSky, and gradually something
genuine enthusiasm has been
Mi 5y the Russian admirals hardi
iii sailing straight for a combat
â¢>he Japanese.
There are many naval officers who do
not believe that Vice Admiral Togo will
accept the challenge. In their opinion
the Japanese will be too prudent in
Mich a crisis to risk the destruction of
their fleet. They believe that Togo's
tactics Mill be to avoid an open sea
fight and that he" will launch a series
of desperate night torpedo attacks in
the hope of throwing the Russian fleet
into confusion, scattering the line of
ships and Riving his faster battleships
and cruisers an opportunity to surround
and destroy them individually, and. if
s=ome of Rojestvensky's ships escape to
Vladivostok, to bottle them up there.
For the moment the conservative
counsels of the peace party, which par
ty realizes that the military situation
will be utterly hopeless if Rojestven-,
?ky's fleet be completely destroyed and
considers it best to open negotiations
before the issue Is put to a test, are
rudely thrust aside. The Admiralty
clamors for a chance to retrieve Its
leputation, and the war party gener
ally seems to be convinced that Rus
sia's position will not be worse if the
battle is lost, while the destruction of
Togo's fleet would spell ruin fo^ Japan.
The Emperor himself, it is understood,
expresses great confidence in victory,
and should victory come he undoubted
ly will fix the imperial seal to the big
naval programme prepared by the Ad
miralty.

aside from those relating to encounters
with the Japanese at various places

fanci*ul is that saying the Baltic
squadron met and engaged two British
cruisers under the impression that they
were Japanese and sank them.

PRALSF FOR ROJKSTVENSRY.
French Critics Admire the Admiral's
Darinff Initiative.
PARIS. April 15. -Interest in Admiral
Rojestvensky's audacious move occu
pies equal attention with Morocco. The
French naval critics praise the Rus
sian admiral as show^g the first evi
dence of bold initiative Russia has thus
far given. It is the general view that
Rojestvensky is likely to fight a losing
battle, in carrying out his design to
sacrifice his own ships in order to crip
ple the naval strength of Japan.
The fact that Captain Clado, who
was Admiral Rojestvensky's chief tac
tician until thÂ« North Sea incident, has
been practically exiled by his appoint
ment to command the fleet of gunboats
on the Amur River recalls his numer
ous naval controversies. While at
tending the sessions here of the inter
national commission of inquiry into
the North Sea incident. Captain Clado
wrote a book, pointing out that gun
boats were one of Russia's greatest
need?. This gives irony to his com
mand of a flaet of such gunboats in the
heart of Siberia.

THE SAM FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. APRIL Ifi. 1905.
Official Sympathy Evenly Divided Be
tween the Belligerent Nations.
Japan No Longer Enjoys a Monopoly of
Sentiment in Washington.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CAUL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, April 15.â As Togo
end Rojestvtr.sky draw together for
tthct the Unu^d States hopes will be
the final struggle uf the war official
sympathy in Washington is almost
evenly divided between the belliger
ents. At the outbreak of the war, al
though the President proclaimed abso
lute neutrality, popular sympathy
throughout the United States and the
tacit sympathy of officialdom here was
with Japan, for two reasons.
Rursia was apparently the more
powerful, end evidently Japan was un
dertaking to right far out of her class.
American diplomacy in the Par East,
ill attempting to maintain the "open
door," had encountered Russian oppo
sition. The Russian Minister in Peking
adroitly contrived to place obstalces
in the way ot the Chinese-American
commercial treaty desired by Secre
tary Hay. The Russian Government
promptly tucked in a pigeon-hole a
protest agninsl the cruelties to He
brews in Kishinev, which President
Roosevelt forwarded to St. Petersburg
at the request of the B'nai B'rlth.
The Japanese had always been prof
fering assurances of respect for the
"open-door" policy. Japan made every
effort to v.in the good will of the Unit
ed Stat-'.s, and at the outbreak of hos
tilities asked this Government to act
as custodian of Japanese interests in
Russian territory.
Since Japan has proved herself no
pigmy power and has driven Russia
back from the sea, besides disposing
of one Russian fteet. officials* here have
lost sympathy tor Japan as the "under
dog. '
It has been realized, also, that Japan
is resolved to gain great fruits of vic
tory, not only irom Russia, but from
her increased prestige when peace
comes.

: these great -reductions. ! amounting > to < from $100 : to $300 on each piano, -Ai. the
first .place, * by making long term contracts with manufacturers and by buy-
ing in large quantities for all our; stores, -we cet lower,?, prices than the ordinary
dealer. In the second place, our cost of selling a piano is less. A well-known
dealer, of this city says it costs his house an- average of $100 .ito>sell;a,j^tano..-:,:
This cost, Is due partly j to high rents, partly, to big commissions" to music teach-
ers and others, â  and - generally ; to * the * old-style Â«:â¢ method ;, of j-. making an *. enormous
"profit on each sale -and taking a" week or * two: to' close; the, sale.", We have thrown

largely resuonsible for the change of
sentiment. Their experiences in Ori
ental service have convinced many of
mem that the possibility of China be
ing dominated by Japan is not beyond
the realm of the probable, and that
such a combination would be the nat
ural outgrowth of Japanese suc
cess in the war with Rus
sia, v Already the most compe
tent authoritie-s at Peking have re
ported a growth of Japanese influ
ence there. It is more powerful than
the Russian influence before the war,
and that is saying much. It is a friend
ly Influence, which few Orientalists
ten years a a?o would have believed
could have been established in Peking
by emissaries of the Mikado.
Although no person holding an offi

branch of the Government would dare
say so openly, the recent declaration
of Representative Hull of lowa that
the United States had good reason to
fear Japanese success is echoed in
many private conversations here.

Laconic Message*
PARIS. April 15. â Gaslon Dru tele-
graphs from St. Petersburg to the
Echo de Paris that Admiral Rojest- !
vensky's last telegram before leaving
Nossibe was singularly laconic and
eloquent. He wired:
"Will not telegraph again before
the battle. If I am beaten you will
learn it through Togo. If I defeat
him I will announce it to you."
Dru adds that the telegram was ac
cepted to mean that the Russians seek
victory or death.

SECOND PEACE COX FERE XCE.
State Department at Washington Re-
fuses to. Give Programme.
WASHINGTON. April 15â Inquiry
Into the status of the negotiations ini
tiated by President Roosevelt looking
to a second peace conference. suggesteJ
by Lord Lansdowne's reference to the
subject in the British Parliament, de
velops the fact that the State Depart
ment here has completed its functions,
so far as the matter is concerned, at
least for the present, having remitted
to the executive council of The
Hague Tribunal. This was done
notwithstanding an e^rt on the
part* of the German Government
to Induce this Government to
outline 'the programme of subjects to
be considered at the second conference.
For some reasons the State Depart
ment would have been pleased to ac
cede to this German suggestion, but It
was concluded that to accept It would
be to Jeopardize thÂ» success of the un
dertaking. It was hoped thatVon
flicting views of the great nations as
to the limitations to be placed upon the
conference could be more easily recon
ciled by this executive council, whose
recommendations would be free from
any suggestion of leaning toward the
interests of any one power, and even
the peculiarly favorable situation of the
United States might not suffice to pre
vent the suspicion on the part of some
of the powers that the State Depart
ment's suggestions in the shape of a.
programme were not entirely disinter
ested.
HOW TOGO WAS OUTWITTED.
Made to Believe Baltic Fleet Would
Traverse Sunda Straits.
LONDON. April 15.â A telegram from
Singapore, Straits Settlement, was re
ceived here to-day, announcing that
the Peninsular and Oriental Steam
ship Company's steamship Marmora
sighted five Russian battleships on
April 3 in latitude 8 degrees south and
longitude 92 degrees east, steering for
the straits of Surjda.
The chief interest in the dispatch
Iks in its giving the exact location of
the squadron, indicating that it steered
almost due east from Madagascar, it
is presumed here with the object of
creating the impression that Rojest
vensky intended to traverse the straits
oi" SundV and draw away the Japanese
from the Malacca Straits, through
which he ultimately passed in safety.

TIMBER FRAUD
CASES CALLED
PORTLAND, Or., April 15. âIn the
United States District Court to-day
Congressman J. A. Williamson filed
demurrers to the two indictments re
turned against him by the recent Fed
eral Grand Jury, while his partner. Dr.
Van Gessner, aud former United States
Commissioner Marion R. Biggs en
tered pleas in abatement. All the mat
ters at issue will come up for a hear
ing on Monday.
One indictment against Williamson
accuses him, in conjunction with Unit
ed States Senator Mitchell, Congress
man Binsrer Hermann and others, of
having conspired to defraud the Gov
ernment out of a portion of its public
lands in connection with an alleged at
tempt to secure the establishment of
the Blue Mountain Forest Reserve in
Eastern Oregon.
Williamson demurs on the ground
that the character of the alleged fraud
is n->t specifically stated and that the
indictments failed to describe the land
as to which the fraud is alleged to
have been perpetrated.
Gessner and Bipgs. in their plea
in abatement, attack the qualifica
tion of the jury which indicted them.
Williamson, together with his part
ner. Gessner. and William D.
P<iggs, former United States Commis

for subornation of perjury. It being

Steamship Jupiter Falls to Reach Hal-

From St. Johns.
HALIFAX, N. S.. April 15.â The
Furnesa line steamship Jupiter, which
left St. Johns for this city seven days
ago, has not been sighted and it is
thought some accident has befallen
her. The passage usually 13 made in
forty-eight hours.
The Jupiter left Liverpool on March
8 for this port, but encountered heavy
gales and was disabled. The accident
so delayed her that she was out more
than three weeks before the coast of

thought possible that the steamer en
countered heavy ice and is either
damaged or imprisoned by h#avy

KLSIIT OF K.M'LRIMEXT.
The -Xanier II -was constructed by
. Yarrow & <;0.,; 0 ., the world's
greatest torpedo-boat .builders, and is
engrined with two 4 5-horsepower Na
pier motor encrines. each driving its
own propeller shaft She was a fail
ure liiEt^year. In the trial races for
the international cup her bow plates
beta m._- cracked under the strain of
rheeting the sea. and her engines did
not work smoothly. She succeeded,
however, in beating the American
flier Chnllenger, which was then also
a victim of bad luck, faulty ignition
depriving her of the use of some of
her cylinders. But the Napier 1[
broke down completely before the
flnal race and was unable to come
to the starting line â the prize, after
a squabble, being awarded to a French
boat, the Trefie-a-Quatre.
No craft ever before built has been
the subject of bo many and varied- ex
periments to arrive at the best shape
of boat and most efficient mechanism.
Phe is as chock full of science as the
latest battleship. To ascertain what
form of hull went, easiest tlwough the
water, a number of full-sized model!"
'were built and towed behind a tor
pedo-boat, the resistance at varying
afsMda being indicated by a dynamo
meter. Siive IrtFt year several dif
ferent bows have been tried upon her.
In that finally adopted the fore-foot
has been cut right au.-ty, giving- al
most a flat floor from stem to stern
and making a complete skimming
dish of her.
HKR BOW VERY BM XT.
Bbs is entirely lacking In thnt fine,
knife-like entrance whit-b Is supposed
to be essential to the highest spee<s.
The bow. in fact, is very blunt â just
as if two or three feet had been '
chopped off â but as the boat, when
driven her fastest, haY her fore-foot
lifted dean out of the water, the
thickness of the stem is of no mo
ment. The bow has an extreme flare
on the top side to turn off the crest
of the bow wave, splash guards or
"â whiskers" also being fitted as an ex- ,
tension of this Hare. It is this de
vice, throwing off on either side great
torrents of spray, that produces the
peculiar effect of wings when she is
seen bow-on.
The number of different propellers
that Have been tried to get the most
effective form, when driven at over a
thousand revolutions a minute, would
have been quite beyond the capacity of
ordinary boat-builders. No expense
nor pains has been spared to make
her the BWlftest craft of her siae afloat,
and Bhe is now several knots faster
than she was at her best last year. As
the Challenger has also been greatly
Improved, It is the hope of naval men
that the two boats will meet again ln
the race for the International trophy,
which will take place in a few months.
THE COMBUSTION EXGI>'K.
It Is not alone the fact that she is
the fastest boat of her size yet built
which makes this marvelous little
craft worthy of attention. Vastly
more interesting; is she as evidence
that the time Is not far distant when
the internal combustion engine, which
works by the explosion of vapor or
gases, will displace the steam engine
as the chief instrument of man's mas
tery over the sea. On that subject no
map is more competent to speak with
authority" th&ir'A: Fi Yarrow. He has

j the latest form of steam machinery of
an equally reliable character, we
should not like to name more than six
teen knots. So it may be taken that
the adoption tif the internal combus
tion engine for a vessel of this size
really represents an additional speed
of ten knots an hour.
"The speed of ji vessel incrPnses
rapidly with its size. For exninple, in
what is termed a second-class torpedo
boat, sixty feet in length, th^ best
speed we could Obtain would be twenty
knots, but for a vessel, say 200 feet in
lensih. with proportionately larger
machinery, a speed of thirty knots
could be obtained. Therefore the ob
taining of a speed of practically twen
ty-|i9 knuts in a boat only forty feet
in liMigtli points to the possibility in
the not far distant future of propelling
a vessel of MO feet in length â such as
the destroyers we built for-the Japan
ese Governmentâat forty-five knots.
All that remains to be done is to per
fect the internal combustion engine so
as to enable' large sizos to.be success

STEEL PLANT
ON THE SOUND
Pittsburg Syndicate Ready
to Build an Open Hearth
Works South of Everett
Special Dispatch to The Ca.ll.
TACOMA. April 15.â Walter Kennedy,
a mining engineer of Pittsburg, Is at
the head of a Pittsburg syndicate which
purposes to build an open-hearth steel
plant at Richmond Beach, on Puget
Sound, south of Everett. Associated
with him are J. G. Root of the State
Supreme Court and J. D. Mclntyre,
formerly adjutant general of the Na
tional Guard. Tno' have organized the
Pacific Coast Steel Company, of which
Kenned^ is president, to build and op
erate the plant. An option has been
secftre*d on the town site of Richmond
Beach, together with additional acre
age. Kennedy will arrive here within
a few week* to investigate the local
sources or iron supply preparatory 40
beginning work.
The plans for the steel plant were
formulated by the late Homer Swaney,
formerly of Pittsburg and McKeesport,
who lost his life in the Clallam steam
ship disaster fifteen months ago. The
company is now acquiring title to the
iron mines in Southeastern Alaska and
Eastern Washington. Last year $35,
000.000 worth of iron and steel products
were used on the Pacific Coast and in
Alaska. Local manufacturers will have
the advantage of $9 to $18 per ton
freight rates on steel products from
Pittsburg in securing this business.
INSPECTOR* 'eNGEU:KE HERE.â KmII
Engelck*; Chinese Inspector in charge of the
United States Immigration office at San Diego,
Is in this city on business. -â¢ '
cently stated that the internal com-
Ivdstiun engine gave a result equal to
that of the steam engine upon one
third of the weight of the fuel re
quired by the latter, while Its mechan
ism was only one-sixth of the weight.
It is these advantages, even more than
the- far higher speed obtainable, which
muat lead to the general abandonment
of the steam" engine in favor of the
motor engine for propelling vessels of
various types. Torpedo-boats at more
than fifty miles an hour: motor liners
at much the same speed; light craft
traveling at about double their present
rates and fishing fle?ts independent of
vlnd and tide â these are among the
certainties of the future and prob
abilities of the time near at hand.
Meanwhile Krglish yacht designers
are turning- their attention more and
more to motor boat building, working,
in combination with engineers to
evolve the fastest possible type. Lin
ton Hope, who has been known for
several years as the most successful
designer â  of small racing crait here,
has designed the hulls of a couple of
boats that will be entered in the con
test for the international cup. One of
them Is Pot Lionel de Rothschild. Of
pra< licully tht same size as the Napier
11, they, have far fln^r lines ;md will
be driven by cngiiivs of 150 horse
power.

GOODWIN WILL
HAVE NEW PLAY
Eseeial Dispatch to The Call.
LOXDftX, April 15. â Haddon Cham
bers, who wrote "The Tyranny of
Tears" and "A Modern Magdalen," has
been in the south of France for the
last few months, where he has been
â working on the play commissioned
from him by Xat Goodwin. This is
now almost finished. It is a comedy
and probably will be called "Ch
Swagger Friend." The story deals with
the outcome of a passing friendship
made on a dull sea voyage, and Cham
bers believes that he has fitted Goodwin
with a r>art in which he w ill score
hugely. This part probably will be
played in London by Arthur Bourchier,
who produced the last play of Cham
bers which was eeen here, "The Golden
Bilence." This piece had v lot of good
point*, but it was not a success.
His new comedy for Nat Goodwin,
however, is not the only piece that
Chambers has had under way during
his stay in the Riviera* Like many
another more or lees "serious" drama

TO DRAMATDSS GREAT NOVEL.
Perhaps the most interesting theatri
cal news this week is that Flaubert's
groat novel, 'Madame Bovary," is
about to be adapted fur the stage by
Busnach. the French playwright, who
made the famous dramatic version of
Zola's "L'AsFommoir." At the first
blush one does not exactly see the mak
ing of a successful play in Flaubert's
masterpiece, whose qualities are chiefly
literary, but Busnach evidently thinks
differently. Busnach is now working at
his adaptation. It ia greatly to be
hoped that it will be successful and
that an actress may be found to play
the part In the United States.
When some comparisons were made
between Jean Richepin's "Dv Barry"
at the London Savoy and David
Belasco's play on the same subject, it
was assumed that M. Richepin must
have been fairly well satisfied with the
Savoy version of the work â on the
ground that after attending the re
hearsals he occupied a box at the first

night performance. This assumption
proves to have been correct, M.,Rlche-.
pin, who has returned to Paris, "hav
ing sent Mr.-. Drown Potter B letter
expressing his appreciation /of the
manner in which "Dv Barry" is pre
sented and acted by her. '"I am still,"
so his letter runs, "under the charm
of your original creation^ which is at
once both sipirtual and impassioned,
and of your attitudes, sometimes
mutinous, sometimes tragic, and al
ways imprinted 1 with 'rare beauty, a
noble pride and an exquisite grace!
Your Dv Barry appears to me one of
the most splendid figures I have seen
during my dramatic ; career.'* N" V -.
AWARDED DAMAGES.
If it were not stated candidly that
the new piece about to be produced
by George E&jvardes at the London
Daly's is an adaptation from a French
opera by Messager, playgoers here
would be likely to entertain uncharit
able suspicions concerning its possible
genesis. The last two attractions at
this theater were "A Country Girl"
and "The Cingalee." When the run
of the first was about half over .i play
wright named Augustus Moore ac
cused Edwardes of having cribbed
several of the best ideas in it from a
scenario which Moore had submitted
to him, but which the manager had
rejected. The dramatist sued Ed
wardes and so fa.r proved his case
that he was awarded $500 damages.
Later Edwardes produced "The Cinga
lee," which ran nearly a year. And
now. after one of the most sensational
theatrical trials ever held in London,
a. special jury has ordered Edwardes
to pay $15,000 to a writer named
Fraser on the ground that "The Cinga
lee" is practically a copy of a piece
called "The Hanjiahn," which Fraser
originally submitted to Edwardes, and
which the manager declined to pro
duce. The evidence proved so con
clusive that little comment upon it Is
called for.
When Captain Fraser, who is an Eng
lish officer stationed, in India, first sub
mitted his manuscript of "The Han
jiahn" to Edwardes the latter imme
diately opened negotiations with him
regarding its production, but these were
broken off because Fraser declined to
work with a collaborator suggested by
Edwardesâ J. L. Tanner, author of
"The Messenger Boy" and "The
Orchid"â and Fraser'a manuscript was
sent back to him. When "The Cingalee"
was produced the "book" was credited
to Tanner, who is a regular member of
Edwardes' staff. But between this play
of Ceylon and the play of India, which
he had offered to Edwardes, Captain
Fraser discovered such unmistakable
singularities that he lost no time in
bringing the suit which haa just been
i concluded. It Is remarkable that Ed
j wardes ever allowed it to go to trial.
"The Cingalee" has been produced In
the United States and Its main them*
probably will be remembered.
In Captain Fraeer's play the heroirie
was to make her entrance through a
tangle of irises, which gTOW wild in* In
dia. In "The Cingalee" the heroine,
Nanoya, is first seen looking through
a tangle of Irises. But these flowers do
not gTOW In Ceylon! Edwardes specific-
ally denied having passed on Captain
Fraser*s scenario to Tanner to be used
i as he saw fit, and Tanner as vigorously
I denied having; utilised the military
| man's ideas. If, however, the whole
â  thing was an accident the verdict for
. â  Captain Fraser of $15,000 is likely to
| prevent the occurrence of such mls
! takes in the future so far as the man
| agement of Daly's is concerned.
MEXICAN GETS
BALM FOR WOUND
WASHINGTON, April 15. â The
fell lure of a Mexican citizen to obtain
satisfaction from the authorities of
Cameron County, Tex., for personal
injuries suffered in that county evok
ed a serious complaint to tTie Wash
ington Government from the Mexican
Government against the Texas au
thorities and caused Secretary Hay
several months ago to offer out bf the
Federal treasury ;SSOO; $500 to Mexico in
satisfaction of its official claim for
damages. The story is told in official
correspondence published at the State
Department to-day.
Eulogio Zambrano, a Mexican citi
zen, who pawned at Brownsville. Tex.,
a rifle belonging to a citizen of that
town, was arrested and while being
carried to jail it is claimed he at
tempted to escape and was shot at
and wounded by Private McKenzie of
the Texas Rangers. The Mexican Con
sul reported that Zambrano -was tried
and sentenced without any account
being taken by the court of the
wounds inflictad by McKenzie, but the
Judge in passing sentence on the pris
oner told him that he inflicted a light
punishment because he had been
wounded.
This statement, in the opinion of
the Mexican Government, afforded
ground to insist that the wounding
was unwarranted. In a note to Sec
retary Hay the Mexican Embassador
at Washington entered a formal com
plaint against the Texas authorities on
account of the "slight respect they us
ually evince for the lives of Mexicans
residing on this side of the border,"
and asked for an indemnity in behalf
of Zambrano.
Secretary Hay, In his reply, said: "I
have the honor to say that the depart
ment after careful consideration of all
the circumstances has reached the
conclusion that some compensation
should be made to Zambrano because
of the failure of the authorities of
Cameron, Tex., to try and punish
Ranger McKenzie for unlawfully
shooting him, and it is 'willing to
make payment to you in behalf of
Zambrano of the sum of $500 in full
settlement of the matter."
This offer was accepted by the Mex
ican Government and the incident was
closed.

The little brick house In Edwardes
Square, South Kensington, where the
author of "Abou Ben Adhem" lived for
over eleven years, will be torn down,
along with the others In the samÂ»
block, during the next two months, and
the old-fashioned atmosphere of the
neighborhood will be entirely changed

apartment building.
Hunt moved into the Edwardes
Square house in 1840, and the eleven
yean: he spent there were the most
prosperous and industrious cf his life.

troubles came to an end with the grant
to him of a pension of $1000 a year
from the civil list and the annuity of

The statue Of Hall McAllister was

Judge Hunt introduced D. M. Delmas

GRAPE-NUTS.
HOW FOOD WORKS.
A Sure Way Out of Bowel Troubles.
So called "septic appendicitis" will
often hang on for years. This is caused
by white bread, potatoes and other
forms of starchy food that the Individ-
ual does not properly digest, and It
is useless to attempt to make a perma-
nent change by any form of drug, for
all drug* "wear out" and in time re-
fuse to benefit where the cause of the
disturbance is not removed.
Septic appendicitis Is a general term
for a diseased condition of the bowels
caused from undigested starch, and. as
stated above, it may go on for years;
yet people must have starchy food.
It is a well established fact among
physicians and Individuals who have
made the experiment, that when bowel
disturbances are shown, > a change in
food must be made, and that the fa-
mous predlgested Grape-Nutsâ
ls the most perfect remedy, for it con-
tains no medicine of any sort, but it
Is made up of the selected parts of
wheat and barley In which the starchy
part has been changed into the form
of sugar that is found in the human
intestines after the Btarchy part of
the food has been perfectly digested.
When Grape-Nuts food is used in
place of bread or any of the other
forms of starch, the body Is supplied
with the necessary elements already
in the form of this eugar (known as
â¢ Post sugar") and Is therefore ready,
for immediate assimilation, for the first
act of digestion has taken place out-
Fide of the body and during the pro-
cess of manufacture. . - ...Â»
Absolute certainty of results can be
depended upon and the disease relieved
by this method.
A prominent Missouri editor tells this
cheerful etory:
"For three years I suffered from eep-
tic appendicitis, with all that involves. !
The aid of physicians was inadequate
. and the difficulty of finding food that ;
would assimilate without great annoy-
ance in the region of the vermiform ap-
pendix was fairly insurmountable until
I struck Grape-Nuts.
"Grape-Nuts I relish and digest com-
fortably. They have not only proven :
to be most satisfying and nutritious
food, but they have actually. healed my
ailment. I am, â¢ to-day, after several
months' use of Grape- absolutely
free from any disorder whateverâ in
pÂ»*rtect healthâ ; I - attribute my
Rtrwnirth cf mind and body to Grape-
Nuts." Name given by Postura Co.,

Ragland, president of the California
.^lat* Bar Association.
Judge Hunt, in introducing Mr. Del
mas, said:
EAGER TO CONTRIBUTE.
"Seventeen years ago Hall McAl
lister died. A year since a movement
was begun to erect a statue to his
memory. So great was the reputation
that had survived the passage of years
th;vn more than 125 laymen and law
yers came voluntarily forward and
subscribed more than enough money
for the needed purpose. The statue is
entirely a California production. It is
marie from metals of this State, lit
was designed by R. I. Altken, who
was born in this State. It was cast in
this State and the granite pedestal
upon which it stands is from this
State.
"The Board of Park Commissioners
granted us this site wherefln to place
the statue because it was near the
courts, where the great lawyer won
his triumphs, and aiso beside the
street which bears his name."
The address delivered by Mr. Del
nfas, v.-as in part, as follows:
"Before proceeding to attempt the
discharge of the duties you have been
pleased to cast upon me I cannot for
bear expressing my appreciation of the
honor your commitee has conferred In
selecting me to voice on this occasion
the sentiments of the bar â an appre
ciation the extent and gratefulness of
which is In no degree lessened by the
consciousness of my own deficiency.
"The generation which knew Hall
McAllister in the zenith of his career
hae passed or is fast passing away.
Of the many distinguished men who,
half a century ago, labored along with
him to give form to the administration
of justice In our State and character
to our bar, few survive; and not
many years shall roll by until the
time â when none shall be left who were
living witnesses to the display of these
transcendent powers of advocacy
which the monument we dedicate to
day is intended to commemorate. Fit
ting was it, therefore, that the merited
tribute which the bar renders here to
one who, while in life, was its most
distinguished member, should no
longer be delayed, but should be paid
now.
IMPERISHABLE MEMORY.
"It is a trite saying â none the less
afflicting because true â that a law
yer's fame, however profound his
learning, great his art or consummate
his eloquence, is as evanescent as words
written upon the sands or the seashore.
From this unmerited oblivion it Is the
affectionate purpose of the bar to res
cue the memory of Hall McAllister.
"Therefore is it that we- are assem
bled here to transmit to posterity some
imperishable memorial of the man
who. In our remembrance. Is associated
with all thÂ« jrreat forensic contests
wapÂ»d In our courts during the first
four decades of their existenceâ the
large frame, cast in heroic mold, as if
to give the world assurance of endless
power of toll and boundhess capacity
of endurance; the massive head,
pedestaled upon the broad Atlantean
shoulders ; the serene countenance, de
noiing conscious and yet kindly and
benevolent power; the easy poise, in
dicative of a temperament retaining its
even composure amid the varying
storms of forensic strife, unmoved by
offensive exultation by the joy of
triumph, undepressed by the disap
pointment and bitterness of defeat. In
this placeâ here under the very shadow
of thetse walls which seem to vibrate

Are Present.
with the echo of his voice, we would
exhibit to the. eye of the present and
of future grenerations of lawyers a
visible representation of him whose
manner of advocacy it might well be
their highest to learn to copy, .
whose career it might well be their
lofticrt ambition to seek to emulate.
"Thus much, at least, shall beâ has
already been done. In the statue ;
which we unveil to the public gaze to- |
day the genius of the sculptor has re
produced the outward semblance â I
had almost said the living form â of
Hall McAllister.
"It may not. therefore, be deemed
an inappropriate part of the present
ceremonial that those who were his
contemporaries should tell what it
was that constituted the mainspring
of Hall McAllister's success as an ad- ,
vocate.
IN DISPUTED LEADER.
"But first let the extent and scope
of that success be measured. When ;
he closed his eyes in his stately man- '
sion at Miramonta on the Ist of De- J
ceraber, 1898, Hall McAllister had j
been the undisputed leader of the bar
of California for over a quarter of a
century. During that period not only
had this coast attracted here lawyers
of the highest eminence from every
part of the Union, but the cosmopoli
tan composition of its population, the
diversified activities of its inhabitants,
the variety and novelty of the legal
problem* presented by the foreign ori- ,
gin of its land titles, the peculiar
condition of its mineral wealth, the
unprecedented local character of its
laws, opened up new realms of lit
igation unknown and unexplored In
other communities. To be the fore
most advocate at this bar during that
period meant the ability to engage
indiscriminately in rapid succession
in any contest which might arise any
where over this vast .realm of ever ,
varying contention. The position held
by Hall McAllister had as its chief
sanction the fact that this he could
do, and did for over thirty years.
â¢'What was the source of this mar
velous versatility? Those who have
the amplest opportunities of studying
his methods will with one accord pro
claim that the secret of his success
lay In an almost boundless natural
capacity for work, a disposition and
will to tax that capacity to its utter
most, and the consummate art of ex
erting it to the best conceivable ad
vantage.
"It may be confidently asserted
that during the years of his practice
no man in the State, whatever his vo
cation, worked as hard as did he.
RESULTS OF PATIENT LABOR,
"The results of this patient labor
were manifested in the open contests
before the court. Never were causes
tried with more absolute system.
"In public affairs he took no part.
Public occasions for the display of his
abilities he studiously and . rigorously
avoided. And yet his powers of elo
quence were of the very first rankâ â¢
of forensic eloquence, be it said. Al
ways calm, almost judicial in Its meas
ured course, his speech while address
ing court or jury moved forward with
easy grace. Its tone was never low
ered. It never derogated from the
dignity which beseems a* man of
education and refinement. Never ex
travagant, and always aiming at di
rectness and plainness, It was always
sufficiently adorned to . rescue it from
tameness. Thus conceived it had. of
course, its unavoidable limitations.
The spell which the genius of Prentiss
could throw over a jury it was not his
to cast, the inspiration which burned
In whirlwind < fire the captive hearts
and minds of < stern New Englanders
was not his. To such "gifts he would
have been the last to lay claim. His
was the language calculated to win
the confidence of practical men of af
fairs â ' such men as. In his day con
stituted the Juries of this city.
â  "I have said enough, If I have suc
ceeded in â¢ showing, however f Imper
fectly, that the lesson, which the ca
reer of Hall McAllister Inculcates is
that the highest â  prizes of - the I law lie
within the reach of those who, by un
swerving devotion : and | unremitting
toil, devote their lives to their attain
ment. . . , / '.â  .' ".. .â  ' ; : .;:.,. -' V-v-.'
"Therefore It is that 4to the city in
which his life was spent and 1 in which
his ashes repose, and to the | State, we
now dedicate, for time and for etern
ity, this; statue 'â¢â . of â ; Hall : McAllister."

Yesterday's stprm came up rather un
expectedly from the sea and extended
from Monterey Bay northward. Only .3*
of an inch was precipitated, but the
weather forecaster says that the storm
is not over. The cloudy weather Is
creeping slowly southward and will prob
ably extend the full length of the State
before it becomes dear again. To-night â
it will probably rain as far south as *
Point Conception and conditions are fa
vorabl* for showers Sunday.

.When the hair becomes
dry. brittle and falls out
and dandruff forms upon
the scalp it is an absolutely

diseased conditions, which,
unless promptly treaicd,
will result in baldness.
O>ke Dandruff Cure is
the only remedy thus far
discovered which will not

That it will do so has
been proved by thousands.
It is a perfectly pure

It is delightfully refresh-

vigorous growth takes the
place of that which has been
lost.

of Mind While His Ponies Run
Away After Collision.
Policeman W. T. Hooper, who has
the cruelty to animals detail, looks
upon Kaspar Pisch?l Jr., the 12-year
old son of Dr. Kaspar Pischel, 1817
California street, as a hero.
The boy was presented with a pair
of ponies and cart by hi B father on his
last birthday. On Friday afternoon
he went for a drive, accompanied by
two of his boy friends. At Devisadero
and McAllister streets the boy pulled
up till a car had passed. Just then
an automobile driven by A. Knowles, ;
318 Bush street, came sweeping: round t
the corner and dashed Into the cart, j
damaging it bcdly. The ponies be- j
came frightened and started off on a i
gallop. Young Pischel tightened his |
hold on the relna and told his com
panions not to Jump.
Policeman Hooper wu driving in
his buggy near the scene at the time
and he jumped out and Boon had the
frightened ponies under control. He
took the boys home in his buggy. He
said that young Pischel was as cool as
a veteran and through his presence of
mind probably saved his own life and
the lives of his boy friends. No blame
was attached to the automobilist.

it was only after a desperate right that
Cox was re*cued.
While wagons in a caravan sent to
the Santa Fe freight yards, at
Twelfth and State streets, were stop
ping there. John It. Smith, one of the
non-union drivers, was struck on the

WOMEN ALLIES
OF BEEF TRUST
Alleged to Have Aided in
the Flight of Their Hus
bands to Canadian City
CONFER" WITH PACKERS
Planning for a Trip to
Europe as the Reward
for Their Assistance
CHICAGO, April 15.â The Grand Jury
investigating the alleged "beef trust"
has made especial efforts to obtain
enough evidence from two wumen and
one man to indict a high official of one
of the leading packing firms in Chicago.
The charge is attempting to influence
Government witnesses. The three wit
nesses were summoned and were rig
idly questioned, but failed to tell as
much aa had been expected.
Although indictments on the charge
named have been returned against five
peiÂ£ons, it is claimed that efforts are
still being made to interfere with Gov
ernment witnesses. It is reported that
the iirst intimation of the alleged in
terference with another witness was
gathered from the testimony of E. B.
Fish, on whose testimony "four em
ployes of Sehwarzchild & Â£ulzberger
were indicted on Thursday.
Two Chicago women are said to form
a link in the chain of evidence which
the Government is trying to forge
around the packers. The women are
Mrs. Irving A. Vant. wife of the as
sistant secretary of Swift & Co., and
Mrs. Richard W. Howes, wife of the
head of the casing: department of Swift
& Co. The husband of each woman is
in Canada. Vant and Howes left Chi
cago shortly before the Grand Jury
convened.
That the husbands are in Canada at
the instigation of the legal advisers of
a certain packing company is a charge
which, it is said, the Government seeks
to prove from the testimony of the
wives, both of whom returned from
Canada within the last few da>s.
Since returning Mis. Howes is said
to have met an attorney connected with
a prominent packing rlrm and dU
cuaced plans for a trip to Europe with
her husband. A similar trip for the
Vasts is said to have been discussed at
the same time.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN. April 15.â Emperor William
has called one of his college chums to
the Prussian Cabinet. He recently ap
pointed Dr. yon Bethmann-Hollweg to
the important portfolio of Prussian
Minister of the Interior, vice Baron yon
Hammerstein, deceased. The new Min
ister is one of the Kaiser's warmest
personal friends, dating from the days
when they were students together at
the University of Bonn. They were not
fellow students, but fraternity
era, being members of that his
and ultra-exclusive "corps,' the
â da to which most of the Princes
and noblemen of Germany have be
longed in university days. The Kaiser,
ing the ideal upon which is sup
to rest the success of American
iars, has always "taken care of

When tbe fHirC'riF of President Harper of
the .Chicago University cut him open to operate
for apnenaicitis, they found that their d}s-
tlÃffaished patient was evtlcriztg from cancer
of the colon (large bowel). His condition was

the only chance to save his life was by the
application of ' El<?ctro-ChemiBtry. President

City for the explication of this wonderful new
'treatment. Notwithstanding the severity of
â  the case, Electro-Chemistry helped him from
the very start and now he is back at his
'noire tn Chicago, probably out of danger. Ar-
rangements havo been made to continue the
treatment at bis home. In many case* Electro-
<"hemistry is successful where surgery falls.
Mrs, tVllliarn Barnes of Blacks Station, Cal..
was told by her phyeiclans that she would
have to undergo a surgical operation for the
cure of a. cancer of the breast. Mr*. Barnes
.consulted two surgeons regarding the opera-
tion and both founj that the .operation would
be hazardous fs-em tmr run-down condition,
due to the spreading of this cancerous poison
throughout her ryttetn. and because of a weak â 
heart It would have been fmr>oss)bje to have
given her chloroform. Mrs. Barnes Was advised
to take the Eleetro-Â£hemic treatment lor the
cure of. her cancer, and on July 16, ' 'â¢â  Ll,L 1 , ehe

Appointed a Member |
of the Cabinet of
Prussia.
his friends" since he became Emperor. !
Dozens of them are filling military, '
naval and civil offices of importance :
and rich emoluments, and he delights !
to honor "them. His Majesty's recollec- I
tions of Bonn are among the very hap- ]
piest of his life, and the intimacies
formed beneath the elms fringing the
Rhine at that picturesque spot are |
cherished by him, amid the exacting dv- j
ties of kingehfp at Berlin.
Dr. yon Bethmann-Hollweg is two !
years the Kaiser's senior, being 48 years !
old. He is a Prussian, born in the i
province of. Mohan-Finow, and has ad
vanced rapidly in various departments
of the Government service since enter
ing it in 1879. His latest position, from j
which he was advanced .to Cabinet !
rank, was that of president of the pro- !
vince of Brandenburg, in which Berlin
and Potsdam are situated, and there- I
fore the most important district of its
kind In the empire. He was a member
Of the Reichstag for one term, repre
senting, a Moderate-Conservative 'con
stituency. His grandfather was a Prus
sian Minister of BducStton and Wor
ship.
His appointment is said to have come j
as a great surprise. The Kaiser made !
the new Minister aware of his promo- â 
tion the other night in Berlin at the j
opening performance of the remodeled !
Theater Royal. He told him of it quite j
casually between net.*. Next morning
the papers were fun of the news, giving ;
unique details of how his Majesty de
lighted In catching his new Minister oft
his guard with ihe announcement of
the distinction he .vas about to confer
upon him.
Poultney Bigelow, the American
writer, as is well known, was a class
mate of Emperor William and of the |
new Prussian Minister of the Interior j
at Bonn. Bigelow had a -fine chance to j
keep on the most intimate of terms i
with the Kaiser, so it is related in Ber- j
lin, but threw away, the opportunity !
by accepting an engagement from an j
enterprising American life insurance
company, which hired him for cam
paigning in Germany on the strength
of his august connections. The Kaiser
never liked the idea of his friendship
being exploited in this way, and Bige
low has never enjoyed, the same, stand
ing in Berlin since. then. William II
was immensely fond of Bigelow and
used to find frequent opportunities of
honoring him, both before and after
becoming Kaiser. ' â 
Another, of .the Kaiser's classmates
who ranks among the "coming men" of \
Germany i*v Baron Windheim, former j
police president of, Berlin. "He is now
president of the province of Frankfort
on-the-Oder and is said to he slated for
the first high honors at his Majesty's
disposal.'
COUNTESS OF ORFORD
IN FAMOIS MANSION
Former Miss Corhin of Xe\v York
Mo\r> to Picturesque
Wolterton Hall.
LONDON, April 15.â The Countess of
Orford, formerly Miss Louise Corbin of
New York, daughter of the well-known
railroad magnate, has just moved from !
Mannington Hal!. Norfolk, to Wolter
tOfi Hal!, the smaller but more pic
turesque residence which the Earl owns
in the same county, it will l>e their j
permanent home in future. Though t
Lord orford was born there, it had not ]
previously been occupied for some- I
thing like fifty years.
It has taken two years to get the old
place fixed up and renovated. The dec
orations and rearrangements of the in
terior have been carried out under Lady
Orford's personal supervision, with
rare taste so as to harmonize with the
original structure. She has replaced
all the old pictures and tapestries
which formed part of its furnishing
when it was built by Sir Horace Wal
pole. It is a fine old Jacobin mansion,
standing in the midst of a beautifully
wooded park.
Few peers have had such an adven
turous career as Lord Orford. He en
tered the navy as a midshipman when
he was a small boy and at 14 waa ship
wrecked in the troopship Hjag^ra off
St. Paul's Island, eighteen hundred
miles from anywhere. He spent three
terrible months with his comrades- on
th* island, subsisting for the most part
on sea fowls 1 eggs and seaweed. He
took part ID a three years' crusade
against the -slave dealers of the South
Seas after that, helped annex Fiji, and
was in other exploits before he retired
from the navy.
His American v.ife, whom he married
in 1888, shared his roving spirit, ac
companied him on his world- wide trav
els and participated in big game shoot
ing with him in various parts of the
earth. Now tjlxat they have done' the
globe pretty thoroughly and settled
down, society hopes to see more of thiÂ»
interesting couple- than it has hereto
fore done.

NEW BRIGADE STILL
WITHOUT COMMANDER
Damaged Ellis-Street Armory Has
Been Entirely Renovated â House-
' Warming in May.
Who is to command the new bri
gade of the National Guard in the
northern part of the State under the
! new law has not yet been announced,
j and, while Colonel John A. Koster of
Ills city and W. L. Pierce of Oak
land have been sspoken of for the po
sition, the appointing power has thus
far not given any intimation of the
I probable appointee. During the last
week the friends of Major H. P. Bush,
commanding the First Battalion of
Artillery, and those of Captain C. Jan
sen, commanding Troop A, cavalry,
have been talking of presenting their
names to the appointing power for
the brigadier generalship.
The work of renovation of the Ellis
street armory, wiiich several months
ago was damaged by flre, is almost
completed. More than $4000 has
been expended in the work. It is in
tended to have a grand opening dur
ing the early part of May. It is on
the programme that here is to be a
vaudeville entertainment and a ball
after the inspection of the building by
the general public. On that occasion
those highest in rank in the guard
will be invited to attend.
On Saturday, April 29, the four
batteries of the Artillery Battalion
will go to a point near Tiburon for a
practice march and will hold evolu
tions the following day. The Signal
Corps, which is located in the bat
talion armory, will accompany the
batteries.
Captain J. B. Dickinson of Company
C, Fifth Infantry, located at Peta
luma, will go to San Rafael to-day
with twenty-five men to shoot the first
of a series of three matches at 200,
300 artd 500 yards, with a like num
ber of men belonging to Company D
of the city visited.
Colonel Hayes, commanding the
Fifth Infantry, has, at his own re
quest, been relieved from the regi
mental board and the board now con
sists of Captain Margo and Lieutenant
Bush.
Fireman Burnt by Add.
William Crosby, a fireman on En
gine No. 19 at 1419 Market street, was
fearfully burned about the face and
neck yesterday by the accidental
breaking of a bottle containing sul
phuric acid, which he was using on
the engine at the time. Dr. Herzog
treated the unfortunate man at the
Central Emergency Hospital and he
said that Crosby will bear the disfig
urement for life.
Thacker Back From New Mexico.
Special Officer Thacker of the Wells-
Fargo Express Company returned to
this city yesterday morning after hav
ing identified the bodies of the two
notorious Gates boys, who were killed
at Separ, N. M., a few days ago.
Thacker says the bodies were ex
humed twice in order that their iden
tification might be made complete.
DELIRIOUS WOMAN SAYS
ATTENDANTS ARE BRUTAL
Mrs- >hÂ»i-iii Miller's Cliarges Against
tity and County Hospital Officials
Rouse Her Acquaintances.
The few acquaintances of Mrs. Ma
ria Miller, who was a ahort time ago
removed from 426 O'Farrell street to
the City and County Hospital, have
been agitated by the woman's state
ment that she had been abused and
starved at the hospital. In proof of
her assertion Mrs. Miller shows
bruises on hands, arms and body.
The woman was taken sick at the
O'Farrell-str.eet address and Dr. J. M.
Macclonaid was called. He advised
her to go to the City Hospital and an
ambulance was sent by the Health
Department. The woman refused to
go and a week later the ambulance
called again and she was taken to the
hospital.
Miss Keenan, the nurse in ward E,
where the woman lies, says the
bruises were noticeable when Mrs.
Miller was received. Dr. B. H. Bau
meister, in charge of the ward, said
the bruise* were noticeable the next
morning. The people at tjie house
and the driver of the hospital ambu
lance say they observed no bruises.
The treatment accorded Mrs. Mil
ler at the hospital, the officials there
declare, 1b of the best, but they say
she is continually delirious and often
leaves her cot without permission.
Dr. Baumeister says that since her ar
rival she has not been perfectly clear
in mind.

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
LUMBERMEN ARE
OUT FOR TRADE
Combination Is Broken and
Every Firm Reaches for
All the Business in Sight
HEAVY CUTS ARE MADE
Building Industry Promises
Renewed Activity Under
the Changed Conditions
OAKLAND, April 15. â The lumber
combine, which has held the trade In
haxd in this city for many months,
has been disrupted and under the
chsTiged conditions each company Is
reaching for all the orders in sight at
from 10 to 16 per cent less than it
has been sold for here since the com
bine was organized. The effect of the
breaking up oX the organization, It Is
believed, will have the effect of put
ting life into the building Industry.
As to the cause of the disruption,
the president of one of the largest
firms In the city had the following to
nay: "In the latter part of last year
the lumbermen formed a combination
a_r.d agreed to establish a uniform rate
for lumber and make no bids for con
tracts. The plan worked smoothly
enough until It began to be suspected
that some of the firms were getting
more than their share, and it was
discovered that they had been giving
a rebate to their customers. When
this was known for a fact, the Hum
boldt and Sunset Lumber companies
withdrew from the combination and
others followed, and the Alameda
County Lumber Association is a thing
of the past, and every company is once
more out for Itself."

her room for five days. They have
two girls, of which the mother asks

current had burned the flesh on the en
tire left side almost to a crisp.
Dyer was at work with a crew in
charge of Foreman J. W. Burge of San
Leandro. and just how he met his
death Is not known. The first intima
tion that anything was wrong came at
10:30 a. m., when If. J. Brydges, an
other of the linemen, saw Dyer fall
suddenly across two of the high power

fied and the body was removed to the
branch morgue, where an inquest will
be held.

ing from San Francisco. He told a
member of the crew that he had re
cently come to San Francisco from Los

would open a long knife he always car
ried and threaten to kill us all. He
has chased me out of the house with a
drawn knife, yelling like a Comanche
Indian, and I was always in fear that
he would murder his little sister. He
threw a hatchet at his father, declar
ing that he would brain him. Once
he skinned a cat alive and he was
continually tormenting dumb animals.
"I love the boy and this is a hard
thing to do, but what else is there to
be done? Shall we let the child com
mit a murder before doing anything to
curb him? I have tried to make him
happy and have failed, and I can do
no more."

STANFORD VICTORIOUS
IN THE ANNUAL DEBATE
Argument on Fixing of Railroad Rates
Results In Favor of the
Cardinal Teani.
The three students representing Stan
ford University were declared victors
over the University of California team in
the annual debate of the two universities

students argued on "Resolved, That the
Interstate Commerce Commission shall
be given power to fix and enforce rail
road rates." Stanford took the affirma
tive and California the negative. The
judges. H. U. Brandenstein. Edward S.
Fowler and Jesse W. Lillienthal, decided
In favor of the cardinal team after a
short deliberation.

Dudley D. Sales. Alexander Sherriffs and
Raymond G. Barnett, while Farnham P.
Griffiths. James Walter Scott and Her
bert A. Stout spoke for California. Both
sides put up convincing talks and juoted
facts to substantiate their views, but the
eloquence of Stanford's debaters, to
gether with their clear perception of the
subject, won for them the trophy.

I'p-to-Date Evasion of Taxes.
Our States are burdened with debt.
Our cities are mortg-asred. New taxes
must be provided for all this and the
claim that we grow richer and richer
is made only by taking into considera
tion the aggregations of property
which have the power of passing tax
ation downward. Tax a coal mine and
the consumer pays it, tax the landlord
and the rent rises. It is the producer
that pays the tax â the cotton, and the
c<jrn. and the wheat, and the meat â on
them the burden falls at last.
And what will "be the outcome? The
meat goes beyond our reach. The
wheat is traveling the same road. Just
now the cotton is being wiped off the
face of the earth, because it has not
acquired the power of passing the tax
downward to the mill, which, in turn.
lays it on the shirt and trousers of
labor. The pension bill must run on
forever, of course, but why not lighten
the load in spots that this may be
carried and the "debt of gratitude"
finally paid without foreclosing the
mortgage?â Florida Times Union.

about fifteen miles. From the ridge a
view can be had of the entire Santa.

Consumption Research.
The imperial commission of consump
tion experts appointed by the German
Government some time ago to investi
gate the relations between bovine and
human tuberculosis bacilli held an im
portant meeting: at the Imperial Health
Department. Dr. Weber, one of the
most eminent members of the commis
sion, reported on the work which that
body has already done. The result of
the investigations so far is to show
that bovine and human bacilli are ab
solutely distinct biologically from one
another. The one never changes or
develops into the other.
So far the commission has examined
the bodies of fifty-six persons who died
from tuberculosis. In fifty cases only
human bacilli could be discovered. In
six cases, however, the bovine bacillus
was found. Three of these cases were
young children, and the surmise Is
permissible that they received the bacil
lus from the milk of a diseased cow.
The other two cases which Dr. Weber
regards as most important arÂ« those
where the corpses showed bovine bacilli
in the glands and human bacilli in all
other portions of the body. These were
distinct cases of double infection. An
other most Important case is one of
lung tuberculosis, where in the dis
eased lung both bovine and human ba
cilli were associated.
The conclusion of the commission, in
general terms. Is that tuberculosis in
human beings is caused by the human
bacillus, but that it behooves us to be
careful and to use all prescribed meas
ures to secure ourselves against infec
tion from bovine bacillus.â London

Cannon Tells on Himself.
Congressman Cannon was not al
ways so powerful in Washington as
he has been of late years. He tells
with glee of a visit he once paid to
the Postofflce Department when blunt
F^ank Hatton was Postmaster Gen
eral. He took with him a constituent
vho wanted to be postmaster of his
village. Cannon was bitterly opposed
to him, but did not want to turn him
down openly. When they reached
the department Cannon left the would
be postmaster outside the screen door
and went in to see Hatton. He told
Hatton he intended to bring* the man
in and ask for the place for him. but
begged Hatton to refuse It. "Where's
tho man?" asked Hatton. "Just out
side the door," Cannon replied. "In
that case." replied Hatton, raisin* his
voice so he could be heard a city
blo< k. "I want you to know I have
lying enough to do here without lyinj
for you. Bring him in." Cannon
brought him in and Hatton blandly
appointed him. â Exchange.

NEW RAILROAD
TO BE BUILT
LOS ANGELES, April 15.â H. H.
Clark, a primohent mine owner of Bull
frog, Xev., announces that private cap
ital will shortly build a railroad Into
Bullfrog, to connect with either the
Santa Fe or Salt Lake lines. Frank
Smith of Oakland, the wealthy borax
mine owner, is said to be the man who
is behind the enterprise. According to
Clark, Smith is now on the ground in
Nevada with his chief engineer, and the
actual work of construction will com
mence in a short time. It is said bonds
for the prospective road have already
been floated and the money is in hand
to build. It is intended to run the new
line, Clark says, from either Las Vegas
on the Salt Lake or Ivanpah on the
Santa Fe to Bullfrog, thence to Tono
pah.
WILL TRY TO AMEND
CHARTER OF VALLEJO
Trades and Labor Council Favors a
Section Providing for the Recall
of Municipal Officials.
VALLEJO, April 15. â At a meeting
of the Vallejo Trades and Labor
Council held last evening it was de
cided to appoint a committee to pre
pare an amendment to the city char
ter providing for the mandatory re
call of city officials and have it ready
for submission to the voters at the
next municipal election. The fact
that the Supreme Court has declared
that the election held in Los Angeles
last fall under that provision of the
Los Angeles charter was illegal will
not deter the local unionists from try
ing the experiment here. They say
they have good legal advice that the
act is constitutional If presented in
the proper form.

Barbara fourth, with 18 points, and

tures of the meet were the pole vault,
th- shot put, the high jump and the

by RicharfiÃon of Santa Paula. His

i Rain St<n - High School Ball Game.
The baseball teams of the Polytech
nic High School and the Mission in
stitution met yesterday on the dia
i mond of the Presidio athletic grounds.
j The game, which started with a rush,
' bade fair to be one of the best played
j this year, but was called by Umpire
I Bruce at the end of the first inning.
i The rain and wind interfered to such
| an extent as to make further playing
impossible. It looked at the end of
the first spasm as if Mission would
have the Poly lads just where they
wanted them, as they had scored
j three tallies against a zero for their
opponents. The Bush-street delegation
had a better pitcher who would have
replaced the man then officiating and
in all probabilities would have helped
;wi things up. The game will be
replayed from the start.

Charge of Bribery Is to Be
Commenced on Monday
SACRAMENTO, April 15. â Frank
. French, K. J. Emmons and Eli Wright,
who were expelled from the upper
house of the lust Legislature, appeared
i before Judge Hart in the Superior
Court this forenoon. The men were
indicted by the Sacramento Grand
Jury on charges of bribery. Their at
: torneys made motions to quash the in-
I dictmeiits upon the ground that the
: Grand Jury had not been legally
; drawn. In an opinion rendered a few
I days ago Judge Hart overruled the
i motions and held that the accused
1 men would have to go to trial. This
i morning Judge Hart informed the de
! fendants that their motions were de
: nied.
Judge Hart said that he had re
ceived a t#legram from Kansas City
' from George G. Collins of counsel for
the defense, requesting a delay in the
I case of French. The c\se was then
continued until the 2 9th inst.
The cases of Emmons and Wright
were continued for one week in order
to give the defendants' attorneys an
oportunity to file a demurrer to the
indictments.
It is said that District Attorney Sey
mour has succeeded in locating some
of the marked bills, which ,it was al
leged, were paid to the three men.
The trial of former Senator Harry
Bunkers, also charged with bribery.

THE SAN FRAXUSCU CALU. SUNDAY, 'APRTTJ 1(5. 1905. ~^-
MINNIE'S FLIRT A TION
CAUSES CONFLICT.
She Sips Steam Beer With One Who Admired
â¢
Discovered by Her j Husband and Her Brother,
Ere she became the bride of James
McKenna, about seven years ago, Min
nie O'Brien was suspected of recipro
cating in kind the more than casual re
gard for her shown by Frank Tufts,
and when she recently began to exhibit
repugnance to her household and all
connected therewith, it was reasonable
for James to infer that Frank's pres
ence in the city had something to do
with her state of mind. On several oc
casions she absented herself from home
for protracted periods and without pre
vious announcement, and when she re
turned and told James that she had
been visiting her mother he said noth-
ing, but, like Brer Fox, laid low. Thus
it came to pass that James and his
brother-in-law, Mike O'Brien, found
Minnie and Frank together last Friday
evening in a saloon at Fourth and
Howard streets and that all four of
them were arrested and charged with
disturbing the peace by fighting.
When the quartet were arraigned be
fore Police Judge Fritz, the woman's
gown was torn and her husband dis
played a blackened eye. Mr. Tufts, tall
and stalwart, showed no evidence of
having lately been engaged in fierce
conflict, nor was Mr. O'Brien visibly
scathed. All pleaded not guilty, and
Mr. McKenna told of the fight. Having
received a "tip" that Minnie and Frank
wore tete-a-tete in a private room of
the wet goods emporium hereinbefore
designated, he enlisted brother-in-law
Mike to aid him in fetching Minnie
back to her dwelling and a sense of her
wifely duty. They found her seated
upon Frank's knees and sipping alter
nately with him from a schooner of
steam beor. She demurred to James'
request that she accompany him, and
when he attempted to force her to obe
dience his eye was blackened by a fist
of Mr- Tufts, with whom he immediately
"mixed." In the meantime Mr. O'Brien
endeavored to remove his sister from
the scene, but she resisted and â cream
ed and in the struggle her costume was
rent. " The blowing of a whistle by a
bartender brought Patrolmen Hinrichs
and Arey, who gathered in all the com
batants to make sure that no guilty
person would escape.
"Why did you take away another
man's wife?" the Judge aeked Mr.
Tufts.
"Didn't do It," was the reply. "She
took me away. Couldn't get rid of her.
Wouldn't want me to throw her out o*
doors, would you?"
Mr. McKenna and Mr. O'Brien were
dismissed, ar.d Mrs. McKenna and Mr.
Tufts were ordered into custody for sen
tence to-morrow. The McKennas dwell
on Natoma street, between Seventh and
Eighth, and Mr. Tufts' home is at
Fourth and Shipley streets. Where Mr.
O'Brien resides is of no consequence.
George Anderson, about 18 years of
age, must answer in the Superior Court
to the charge of burglary. While under
probation by Superior Judge Lawlor he
stole brass castings from an establish
ment at Twenty-sixth and Noe streets.
Judge Cabaniss fixed his bail at 11000.
"Go back to Oakland and stay there,"
was Judge Fritz's dismissal of Flor
ence Anderson, about 18 years old and
passing comely. She was arrested for
vagrancy at the same time that George
Miller was taken from a Pacific street
dance hall and booked for larceny on
her complaint.
The girl stated that she lived in the
St. Charles House, on Thirteenth street,
near Broadway, Oakland, and that she
crossed the bay with Miller, father of
two sick children, to have a "good
time." While they were in the dance
hall he plucked a gold chain from her
neck and a purse containing $1 50 from
her hand, saying, "I want these," and
when she told the floor manager what
had happened he recovered the chain
and gave it to her, but could not obtain
the purse, so he called Patrolman Joy
and gave the thief into custody.
"I was only 'Joshing,' " pleaded Mr.
Miller.
"I wish," said his Honor, "that resi
dents of Oakland would confine their
illicit 'good times' to that town, because
the San Francisco police and Police
Courts can be kept from ennui by San
Francisco residents who indulge in that
sort of thing. Miller, you are lined $5,
and Miss Anderson is at liberty to re
turn to Alameda County."
"Gracious, I hope the papers won't
set hold of this." remarked Miss An
derson as she withdrew.
Eddie Kane, a stunted negro,
glanced ruefully at his Panama hat
and then at â¢ the rainstorm battering
the courtroom windows, when Judge
Cabaniss told him he was no longer a
prisoner.
" 'Scuse me er minit, Jedge," he
said, "but do Ah hefter gwout in dat
yah stohm wif dls yah hat?"
"There is no law to compel your
exit from a public, building so long as
you respect the laws that exist," was
the answer.
i Mr. Kane, dolefully, "to' Ah know de
rain'H jes' ruin dls yah lid ob mine."
! When informed that he had radi
cally misconstrued the purport of the
Her Ere Another Won Her Hand.
Four Fight and All Are Arres'ed.
BY JAMES C CXAWFOKD.
"Ah'm sho' sorry 'bout dat," sajd
bench's reply to his query, he bowed
low and with beaming countenance sat
down to await cessation of the outer
storm.
The charge against him was that of
having disturbed the peace of a Mont
gomery-street saloon and to-morrow
he will definitely ascertain whether his
freedom is to be permanent or short
lived.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Eighteen-year-old Ida Newman and
19 -year-old Sadie Kelly are battling
for the questionable honor of being
led to the altar by Charles Lechen of
18 Hallam place. Miss Kelly came
from Salinas to seek employment
about nine months ago and fell into
the clutches of Mr. Lechen, who be
trayed her under promise of marriage
and placed her in a Barbary Coast
dive to earn his livelihood. Then he
met Miss Newman, a domestic at 2214
Steiner street, and beguiled her in
similar manner, but instead of con
tributing to his maintenance she com
plained to Patrolman George Collins,
who arrested the fellow and charged
him with vagrancy. Judge Fritz con
tinued the case one week and hinted
that it might be well for the defend
ant to fulfill his vow to Miss Newman,
who is approaching maternity, al
though his becoming a benedict
would not relieve him of the odium
of having most shamefully treated
Miss Kelly, who Is of mixed Irish and
Spanish parentage.
On the bills of a ten-cent temple of
vaudeville on Powell street he was
headlined as "Bending Bounder," and
by the same title he was registered on
Judge Cabaniss' calendar, the charge
against him being that of peace dis-
turbance. Specifically, he was accused
of having engaged in flstie combat with
a young woman, with whom he was
also engaged to enter matrimony. As
6he did not appear in court, her name
was not disclosed, but an inquisitive
prosecuting attorney elicited the infor
mation that she is a balladist In an
O'Farrell-street music hall, while her
fiance's professional specialty consists
of tying himself in hard knots and un
tying the same in full view of the audi
ence. As he faced the bench and plead
ed not guilty there was nothing in hi 3
appearance indicative of superhuman
physical elasticity, for he was short of
both stature and avoirdupois and his
movements were not reflective of
snakelike suppleness. He was collar
less, and several scratches on his bony
throat were explanatory of crimson
blotches on the neckband and bosom of
his shirt. Special Policeman Swift, who
made the arrest early yesterday morn
ing on Powell street, opined that the
blood was drawn by the balladist's fin
ger nails, but the defendant gallantly
declined to confirm that conjecture.
"We scrapped," he did vouchsafe,
"and what's the use of saying any more
about it?"
But he did say more about it by at
Music at the Park.

Out at the Girls' High School yester

of *T1 down To '04, gathered together
to break bread, to toast to their
blessf-d old alma mattr and to say
*'howdy-do" to ihc comrades who
chared the joys and griefs of the long
*â¬"o â and to swap stories about babes
and husbands, and, as often happened,
of babes loved but not owned â nieces
and nephews.
A human thing Is this sort of re
union, this keeping in touch with
teachers, friends and school. It can-*
not but awaken In us that which
makes for expansion, for tenderness

Through the energetic efforts of

â¢Keeping in Touch"; Mrs. Minnie
Fabin Cooper; Dr. A. W. Scott, on
'The Needs of the Girls' High School";
an original poem by Mrs. Mary Prag.
Now that address of Dr. Scott was
one of the- sanest talks ever given
upon the needs of a school for girls,
showing- , a technical knowledge of
girls of high school age and an intel
ligent regard for their' physical well
being, a talk that should be printed
and given to mothers "who don't '

After the coffee merry chatter filled

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, APRIL 16, 1905.
UNITED ROADS
IN NEW HANDS
Brown Brothers No Longer
Control Car System in
City of San Francisco
BUY STOCK SECEETLY
Laden bur g % Thalmann & Co.
Have Secured 3lajority of
the Corporation's Shares
The control of the stock of the United
Hailroads of San Francisco, which
means the control of the roads and
their administration, has passed from
Brown Brothers & Co. of New York to
I^adenburg. Thalmann & Co. of New
Fork. The change was effected quietly
by the very simple precedure of going
into the market and taking in all stock
tliat was offered tor sale. It is a full
fortnight since the final block of stock
\.as acquired that gave power over the
fireat street transportation system of
this city to Ladonburg, Thatmann &
Co., but so secretly and skillfully has
the matter been handled that it is not
until this morning that definite an
nouncement of the fact can be made.
What the change implies no one in
tins city is in position to say. When the
Market Street Railway was sold to
what was known as the Baltimore syn
dicate it was with the understanding
that the management would be
changed, the now people bringing in
their own executive staff. Then a large
deal was openly conducted and a flat
offer was made for all the properties of
the Market Street Railway system, and
this was accepted.
The present officers of the United
Railroads were asked yesterday con
cerning the change in control of the
roads tha^t they have administered. In
response to queries a typewritten state
ment was sent out, by consent and
with the authority of President Hol
land. In that was the following: "The
further statement is made that no
change is even under consideration
with respect to the management of the
property of the United Railroads."
This would seem to imply that the
officers in this city did not know what
had happened in New York. Confiden
tial advices from that city received by
wire last evening were to the effect
that the purchasing of the control was
successfully kapt away even from the
knowledge of the men who are actually
looking out for the properties in an
executive capacity In this city.
The mileage of the United Railroads
is so great and the control that the
system has acquired of the street car
business of Ham Franrisco so nearly
complete that the announcement of the
new deal is certain to attract a great
deal of attention, and may cause some
anxiety in certain quarters until all
the facts are definitely known.
HUOE CHECK i , PASSED.
When the Market Street Railway sys
tem was sold to the Baltimore syndi
cate a cheek for J17, 590,000 passed. The
shares of stock of the Market Street
Railway were then listed at $98. The
syndicate offered $100 per share.
The deal went through in March, 1902,
and since that time Brown Brothers &
Co. have been in control. Why the
change of ownership has been effected
is not definitely known here. One story
b that Brown Brothers & Co. had so
much trouble with their reads In St.
Louis that they could not hold on In
San Francisco to advantage.
Another story has been circulated
la -San Fraiii-Lsco that there was some
dissatisfaction concerning the expen
ditures on the lines in this city since
they were taken over in 1902. This
story was specifically denied by the
present officers of the system in their
typewritten statement of yesterday, a
few paragraphs from which are as
follows:
â¢â¢While the exigencies of the case
did and yet require a large expendi
ture of moneys in improvements, it is
not true that these expenditures have
given rise to dissatisfaction", for they
(the officers) have been in hearty ac
cord with the campaign of improve
ment that has been bringing the street
railway system to a state of excel
lence, upward of $3,000,000 having
already been expended.
I "The officers further say that they
i are concerned only with the opera
] tion of the property; that they have
Ino concern with any transaction in
j the stock of the United Railways In
1 vestment Company. The further
j statement is made that no change is
j even under consideration with respect
| to the management of the property of
1 the United Railroads. It is admitted
\ that a report will shortly be submitted
by mechanical experts, such as those
I annually made of Its financial position
iby local 'â  - t accountants.
TWO INSPECTIONS MADE.
It is ascertained on excellent au
thority that two inspections have been
made of the condition of the United
Railroads by experts who were sent
out from the East. The first of these
examinations took place some weeks
ago, when the idea of n change in the
control of the properties was first
mooted. Since then other experts
havn traveled over the same ground
and may not yet be through with their
investigations. The first report was
evidently satisfactory enough to the
new parties in control to warrant
them in purchasing the majority of
shares in the company.
Under the influence of purchases
the stock has risen. The market quo
tations for the bonds have also risen
something like $10.
Lad en burg, Thalmann & Co. are re
ported to be very wealthy. The
BieicÃroeders of Berlin, with whom
the Rothschilds have interests, are
associated with Ladenburg, Thalmann
& Co. as partners.
The Market Street Railway dated
back to IS6O, when the beginning of
its operations was celebrated. In

Talk of "Parsifal!" We went in to
"Die Meistersinger" yesterday after
noon at 2 o'clock and came' out hungry

noon â¢ I would rather , have â¢ written
"Die Meistersinger" than any other
Warner opera that blooms. And there
were many with me. 1
The cast was largely responsible.
It will be â many, a fine day before we
hear again a sextet like that of yes- '
terday â only Mr. Burgstalleiy Mr. Van
Rooy, Mr. Goritz, Mr. : â  Blass. ' Mr.
Muehlmarin and Mr. Reiss. The climax
of the first act, when indeed the high ;
C of the music-drama was struck,
an Olympian affair. Consider it. Burg

round, crowning the thing; Van Rooy
pouring . out his great -.vo'^ in a i
miracle of sweetness; Goril: -â¢ u-ight,
pungent barytone shining v. ,: Blass
and v Muehlmann c roundly bassing it;
Reiss, the great : little tenor, "helping

altogether splendid male chorus the |

that tore the house down. \ No wonder

imperious -reason: for its redemand.
The women, unfortunately, did not
matter. ' Miss Bella Alten.^so pleasing
in "Die Fledermaus," ' brought ; {' "Die
Fledermaus" with ; her into '. the . part
of Eva. She' was altogether too light,
too light in voice, 1 too light in ,lone, :
for be it â¢ borne -in mind Master Wag

But the male persons of the cast
mosr gloriously atoned. Perhaps
Bu r j? s taller has a little too much of
the Parsifal gruilelessness in his Wal
ther. Perhaps he is slightly too he
roic In the step of the thing. When it
comes to the singing, however, one
wants nothing more. Burgstaller's
voice to the music-drama is what Ca
ruso"s is to Italian opera. It is the
throat perfect, Ilia soul perfe*^. Van
Rooy is exactly and miraculously the
same kind of ?inger. He Is the bary
torfe end of the Burgstaller voice. One
would have liked a shade more qual
ity In his Hans Sachs, find his humor
was a little heavy. But eminently
Mr. Van Rooy suggested the mobility
and dignity of the chafaeter ;ind sang
In a fashion to satisfy the gods.
Goritz, take him altogether, was
the star of the afternoon, with a won
derful Beckmesser. As a portrait it
stood out of the frame like a Rem
brandt, nay, more like a Franz Hals.
For Mr. Goritz is nothing short of a
great actor. So clever he Is in excit
ing a measure of pity for the dogged,
crabbed old musician, thinking, like so
many of us, that the righteousness of
the whole world is on his shoulders.
As he sung his poor old serenade,
written faithfully, patiently, obstinate
ly after the old ideals, and stood there
the butt of les jeunes. Mr. Goritz's
Beckmesser was anything but a ri
diculous figure. His makeup, with
the pinched little nose, white crabbed
face and unhappy looking wig, was a
fabulously clever achievement. So,
too, his facial play, his gestures!
everything, In fact. conspiring to
make the porttrait the Beckmesser
of one's memory. Reiss sang and act

point. Mr. Blass as Pogner and Mr.
Muehlmann as Kothner were every
thing they should be.
Beautifully, too, went the orches

ments have been marked. Larger
cars have been acquired, lines have

ways.

Enthusiasm and applause ran riot

the leading roles, while those two great
singers, Scotti and Journet, filled out
one of the greatest casts that has ever
been presented before the public here.
At the end of the opera the audience
arose and joined in general applaNise
and cheering. It was one of the great

artists who have visited San Francisco.
It was a fitting farewell to the superb
organization that Conried sent.

DR. LEGGO MAKES A DREARY, DISMAL SHOWING
IN THE HANDICAP AT OAKLAND RACETRACK
Andrew Mack, With Fountain Up, Is Played Down to Favoritism
and Simply Spreadeagles His Field â Big Beach Wins.
Between mud Bpatter* an occasional
glimpse could be obtained of Andrew
Mack, winner of the $1000 handicap,
MM and a sixteenth miles, decided
>t:eterday at Oakland. Billy CahiU's
Charaxus horse, carrying Lloyd Foun
tain and 105 pounds, ruled a mild fa
vorite in the betting. His turn of speed
proved a revelation. Taking the lead
easily, the chestnut lost ground on all
the turns and then won buck-jumping
from St. George and Nlgrette in 1:46*.
Dr. Ler&o, the great three-year-old,
asked to Juggle 113 pounds, also started
'.n the race. Tooman rode him careless
ly, but even with a Shaw or a Hilde
>n-and on hie back there could have
been no other result.
TWO RACES FOR FAVORITES.
Despite the inclemency of the weath
er a big crowd crossed the bay. The
scratching blank marred the pro
gramme somewhat, still the sport wai
good. Favorites took but two races.
Father Catchem, the Candleblack
surprised even his owner by cap
turing the five-furlong run for two
year-olds. A 15 to 1 shot, with Jones in
the saddle, he led from the start, beat
ing Ebel Thatcher less than a length.
Busy Bee, astride which Larsen rode a
miserably judged race, finished third.
Sam Jones' Oregon flyer, Misty's
Pride, acted mean and sour, and, a 9
to 5 favorite, refused to break and
was left at the poet for the five-fur
long purse event. After Smithy Kane
had reached the end of his chain,
Prince Brutus outstayed David Bo-

I Cure the Cases That Others
Cannot Cure.
A bold statement, but just as true
as it is bold. Not all cases that
others fail to cure are curable b>
my methods, but fully ninety per
cent of them axe. The way to learn
whether your case Is curable Is to
consult me. I know exactly, what
can be done In every Instance. I
ought to know this, for I have done
nothinf other than treat men's dis-
eases for seventeen years. If your
cas-i is curable I will treat you. If
it isn't I will not. If I treat you,
and if you so desire,
I Will Wait for My Fee Until
You Arc Well.
WEAKNESS
Functional weakness in men is in
reality a comparatively simple ail-
! ment. and is but a symptom of local
' disorder, a state #of chronic innam-
I mation of the prostate gland. No
' stimulating treatment, whether in-
ternally or locally applied, can do
more than excite temporary activity*
By my system of local treatment X
restore absolutely normal conditions
throughout the organs Involved.
which promptly results in complete
I and .permanent restoration of
j strength and vigor. This treatment
I is original with me, and is the only
1 radical and certain cur* yet devised.
VARICOCELE
Varieocele is a relaxation, knot-
ting and twisting of the most vital
blood vessels of the organic system-
It ctagnates the local circulation
and interferes with the processes of
j waste and repair, Veg-lect briar* de-
[ rangeinent of functions and injury
to the reneral health. Most physi-
cians resort to surgical operations
and hospital treatment. I cure Va-
ricocele in one week without opera-
tion, pain or detention from busi-
ness. My cures are absolutely per-
manent, and no ill effects whatever
can follow my treatment.
The above, together with Con-
tracted Disorders. Spermatorrhoea,
Loft Vlrcr, Specific Blood Poison.
Stricture. Piles and Reflex Ailments,
constitute my Specialty and are the
only diseases X treat. -
Consult He
Frequently there is a misappre-
hension as to the cost of the ser-
vices of a competent specialist. Som*
sufferers are Inclined to think that
because of the complete cures 1
make my fees are exorbitant. They
are not. They are simply PATTt, and
are usually worth five times what I
ask." Before you try other treat-
ment it will be to your Interest to
consult me. That will cost yon "noth-
ing. If you follow this advice you
will SAVE money. If you "try
"cheap** treatment you will WASTE
money: for yon willâ all ' human

land, winning by almost a length.
Wiley piloted the winner, which went
to the post a 4Â»* to 1 opportunity.
Byronerdale, the favorite, led from
start to finish in the mile and a quar
ter selling fixture. At the end the
big bay gelding was hard pressed by
Ledus, which only lost by a neck. Los
Angeleno and Iras ran poor races.
BIG BEACn A WINNER.
The resourceful Charley McCafferty
opened a can of peaches with Big
Beach in the mile and a sixteenth sell
ing run. It was not generally sup
posed that Tommy Taylor could make
the big colt run, but that is all a
fallacy. Trapsetter, backed from
threes to 9 to 5 favoritism, caught the
form players, and Big Beach went out
and spreadeagled the bunch. So
much for form. The favorite exper
ienced no difficulty in downing Stilicho
for the place. Incidentally it might
be mentioned that Sincerity Belle also
ran.
An afterpiece, in one scene, at seven
furlongs, bright, breezy and mirth-pro
voking, sent the big crowd home in a
happy frame of mind. Cigarlighter
looked like a "pipe," still his price re
ceded from even to 13 to 10. He
finished third. Sea Air was all in
at the paddock and Charley Bell land
ed A. MuÂ«koday first by more than a
length. The winner's odds were
backed down from 4 to 3.
TRACK NOTES.
Strange, isn't it, that a mite of a
fellow like Ebel Thatcher can run so
consistently. He must have a great
trainer. The running of the major
portion of that two-year-old is a trav
esty on racinir.
Starter Dwyer said that Misty's
Pride broke and then propped. She
repeatedly stopped while being gal
loped on the way back to the stand.
Tom Ryan ships his stable to Kan
sas City this morning. Bob Smith
and his string leave for the same place
as soon as a car is obtainable.

ly countenance of James J. Jeffries,
the champion heavy-weight boxer of

Bowlers Play on a Sodden Green.
The bowling green at Golden Gate
Park was rather sloppy yesterday af
ternoon, but a few of the enthusiasts
donned their rubbers and enjoyed a
good afternoon's sport. One tourna
ment match was played. The contest
ants were E. C. Medeau and Dr. Ham
ilton. The latter is an extremely hard
man to beat on a dry green, but the
slippery bowls made him an easy vic
tim for Medeau. The score in the lat
ter's favor was 21 to 7.
In practice J. McLachlan and A.
Cross won two games from G. Patter
son and Andrew Foreman. The scores
were 21 to 7 and 21 to 20. A. A. Mc-
Vicar and Robert Park beat Joseph
Gray and Thomas McNaught 21 to 20.
Tells of Brutal Attack.
Arthur Harley, the English civil
engineer who was assaulted Monday
afternoon at the beach while inquir
ing of a young woman the way to an
English tavern, left the care of his
physician yesterday. Recent articles
have made it appear that Harley was
insulting, but the woman's escort was
hasty in striking a cowardly blow.
Harley, who was going to Colorado
Springs the day following the assault,
says that he had $50 in his pocket at
the time of the assault and has not
been able to find it. He believes it
either dropped or was taken from his
pocket at the time of the assault.
Alleged Defective Indictment.
Bert Schlesinger, counsel for George
A. Wright, indicted by the Federal
Grand Jury for embezzling money
while acting as deputy United States
internal revenue collector, made an
argument yesterday in the United
States District Court to show that
thirty of the counts were defective
and should be stricken out because
they failed to allege that the moneys
were the property of the Government.
In fact, they did not show, argued the
attorney, that the moneys were the
property of anybody. The matter was
taken under advisement.

DECLARES LEVY
PAID A BRIBE
Foreman Andrews Says That
Money Was Given for the
Boxing Permit on Friday
GRANEY ELUCIDATES
Village Blacksmith "Puts"
Grand Jury Next to the
Ways of the "Amateurs"'
"I have evidence that Morris Levy
paid for the privilege of holding so
called amateur fights at Woodward's
Pavilion on Friday night," declared
Foreman Andrews of the Grand Jury
yesterday.
Andrews refuses to say to whom the
bribe was given, as the Grand Jury
wjshes to have every detail of the evi
dence complete before definite action
is taken. When ready a bolt will be
shot that will put a quietus on the
Bhady fighting game for some t:me to
come.
At present the Grand Jury's shafts
are aimed at the alleged amateur
fights. The shutting down of Morris
Levy's exhibition was only' a prelimi
nary, according to Mr. Andrews. The
"amateur" bouts are doomed.
Eddie Graney was summoned before ,
Mr. Andrews yesterday and questioned
at length on the methods of fighters
and fight promoters. Though Mr.
Graney modestly declared that what
he knew about prizefighters could be
written on one page of a menu card,
between the entree and the potatoes
au gratin, Mr. Andrews succeeded
finally in making him loquacious:
"This is the way it is," said Eddie.
"A kid finds out he has a wallop. He's
got a job, hee. They puts him up
against a tramp. He cops out the
tramp. Then they puts him against a
good kid and he gets a piece pf coin.
"Very well. Then the kid begins to
loaf on his job. He don't want to
work when he can get the price for
taking a punch. Then the kid goes to
the bad."
Foreman Andrews has discovered
that Levy holds two permits, one for
professional fights, the other for the
alleged amateur goes. The District At
torney and the Grand Jury may ask
the Supervisors to-morrow to revoke
the permits.
Word has come to the Grand Jury
that Morris Levy has made a boast
that he will fix it with the .Supervisors
to promote a fight this month. This
bout makes Foreman Andrews smile.
While the present Grand Jury is in
power fake fights and alleged amateur
fights will not be tolerated. Permits
or no permits, they will be stopped.
The Grand Jury is after the Levy
club in earnest and the fight will be
carried to the end. The San Francisco
Atheletlc Club's goes will also be
stopped if an attempt is made to hold
them.
NATLRE SHOW AT PAVILION
CX)MES TO AX END TO-DAY
Management Has Reduced the Admis-
sion So as to Give All a

The Forest, Fish and Game Associa
tion's exhibition will close this evening
at the Mechanics' Pavilion and to-day
will be the last opportunity of seeing
the nature show, ..he like of
which ma^not be seen again in this
city for many yeara. The management
has reduced the admission to 25 cents
so as to give every one a chance to
make a final visit. Along with the reg
ular musical programme a special one,
containing many . features, will be
given.
During the afternoon and evening
yesterday the boys from the naval
training school gave a series of inter
esting drills and calisthenic exercises,
which won the approval of the crowd.
A competitive drill, in which six dif
ferent boys' clubs strived for first
honors, was won by the Cavalry Re
serve Corps.

ORMONDE'S RIGHT CARRIES PAGET COLORS
TO VICTORY IN CARTER HANDICAP.
â  â¢
Great Horse Outfoots Roseben, Winning Easily by Haff a Length
NEW YORK, April 15.â A great out
pouring of turf enthusiasts witnessed
the opening of the metropolitan racing
season to-day at Aqueduct track and
cheered the victory of Ormonde's
Right, the public favorite in the CarUr
handicap. The winner bore the color*
of Sydney Paget. Neatly ridden by W.
Davis, the Ormonde horse outfooted
David C. Johnson's Roseben and won
easily by half a length. The purse was
worth a bit over $7000. Roseben fin
ished second and William Lakeland's
Little Em third. No records were
broken, birt the handicap was run
within four-fifths of a second of the
best time ever made on the Aqueduct
course.
The weather was perfect, the track
fast and the attendance 20,000. Sixty
bookmakers took their stand in the big
ring, while more than 100 lined up out
side to accommodate small speculat
ors.
The Carter handicap called out a
field of eighteen starters. So evenly
balanced were the chances of all these
thoroughbreds that the Paget entries,
Ormonde's Right and Goldsmith, in
stalled as favorites, were 4 or 5 to 1.
Every starter had hundreds of back
ers, and no partiality was shown in
the applause when the field paraded
past the grand stand. Starter Cassidy
sent them away in good order, with
Ormonde's Right, contrary to his rep
utation as a sulker, showing well tn
front. Positions shifted rapidly in the
first furlong. Roseben, Orthodox, Lit
tle Em and Rapid Water were close
ly bunched and alternated in leading
a stampede for the turn into the wide
stretch. Roseben and Orthodox ran
like a team for a quarter of a mile, but
the Paget colt was always within call,
closÂ« to the rail. When the field swung
into the stretch Davis rushed his
charge to the lore and the race was
as good as won. Roseben and Little
Em clunfc to him like leaches through
the long run down the stretch, but the
others were beaten off and swallowed
up in a cloud of dust. Results:
First rare, five furlongs â Considera
tion won, Right and True second, Tea
Cress third. Time, 1:01 4-5.
Second race, four furlongsâ Oaklawn
won, Commodore Fontaine second,

Fourth race, Carter handicap, $5000
added, seven furlongs â Ormondes

Time, 1-26 4-5. Rapid Water, Bohemia,
Sinister. Goldsmith. Floral King, Orth
odox, Leonidas, Toscan, Emperor of
India, Ocean Tide, Martinmas, Jack

SCORE ON LAND AND WATER
Oarsmen of Berkeley
Cleverly Defeat
Washington.
Race Is Held Under
Adverse Water
Conditions.
The lusty oarsmen of the University
of California, rowing well within them
selves, beat the four of Washington
University by about three lengths In a
two-mile race yesterday morning on
Oakland Creek. There was one false
start, Tilton of the Washington crew
breaking an oar at the first attempt.
It had been intended to row from the
lighthouse at the nvÂ»uth of the estuary
in an easterly direction up to a line off
Aiameda Point, but v. her. it was found
a strong breeze was blowing down the
creek and that the tide was running
out it was decided i to start from Aia
meda Point and row down to the bank
on th narrow gauge mole, nearly op
posite the lighthouse. A train leaving
the dex>ot at Fourteenth street. Oak
land, carried a fair number of specta
tors to the finishing point at the mole,
which was reached about 9:25 o'clock.
The racing crews, however, did not
cross the starting line until after 11
o'clock. The University of California
crew soon assumed a lead and finished
comfortably nearly three lengths ahead
of the visitors from the north, who
seemed pretty well rowed out. The last
part of the race was pulled in heavy
rain. The California boat carried a
cockswain weighing 110 pounds. To
compensate for the extra weight the
shell of the Washington men carried
forty pounds of dead weight in its
sternl
The winning crew was made up of E.
V. Dodge, bow; D. M. Evans. No. 2; J.

STAFFORD'S SENSATIONAL RU.V- I
NEB AND SCENES DURING THE I
COMPETITION AT BERKELEY. |
Rain Stops the Play
in Tennis Tour
nament.
Only one match was completed in the
annual intercollegiate tennis meet, held
at Berkeley yesterday morning, but this
one was won by the blue and gold men.
The second match was started, but the
heavy downpour put a stop to play
after the first set. Claude Wayne, Cal
ifornia's No. 1 player, beat George
Hodge, the Stanford No. 1 player, in a
close and interesting match. Hodge
played a brilliant game in the first set,
smashing perfectly from all parts of
the court. Wayne found the pace too
warm and was able to annex but two
games.
Hodge kept up his aggressive tactics
in the second set, but Wayne improved
materially and his steady game proved
the undoing of Hodge. Wayne took
thip set by a score of 6-4.
The third and deciding set was rather
unsatisfactory. It vas played between
showers on a wet court. The first part
was exceedingly close, first one player
winning a game and then the other.
By some excellent chopping and ac
curate volleying W T ayne ran the score
to 5-2 in his favor. The Stanford cham
pion fought desperately and won the
eighth game. With a lead of 40-15 in
the next game Hodge looked to have a
fair chance to even up the score.
Wayne, however, was equal to the oc
casion and pulled out the game. The
score- in his favor. waÂ« 2-6, 6-4, 6-3.
This match practically settled the
tournament. The teams were figured to
be about equal in doubles, but the
chances for a Stanford victory in the
second singles match look slim.
Thr- contestants were Xeil Baker of
California emÂ«J Reginald McSwain of
Stanford. Baker outclassed his op
ponent and won the first set without
losing a game. The first game of the
second s<-t also went to Baker. The
tournament will be completed next Sat
urday.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. APRIL 18, 1905.
Miller Is the Sensation
of the Athletic
Field Day.
Championship Rests \
With California's j
Sturdy Sons.
The blue and gold of the University
of California waved in triumph yester
day both on land and on water. The
boat crew defeated the Â»four from
AYashinpton; a Berkeley man won the
only match played for the tennis cham
pionship, and the track team scored a
sweeping victory in the meet with
Stanford, representatives of the State
I'riversity winning line of the four
teen events on the programme. The
score by points was 72 1-3 to 49 2-3.
For the first time since the intercol
legiate track meets were instituted in
1893 the elements frowned on the ath
letes- and the various competitions
were held under trying circumstances.
The track was heavy, while the pole
vault lost all Its spectacular features
owing to the polos sinking deep into
the soft earth. This condition discon
certed the Stanford men, none of them
vaulting up to his standard. Zoph
won. defeating Lanagan, to whom the
event had practically been conceded.
The athletes generally presented a
bedraggled, mud-bespattered appear
ance. Umbrellas were brought into use
repeatedly by the spectators, but the
rain could not dampen the enthusiasm
of the adherents of the rival colleges.
The two bands were out and the root
ers shouted their cries to their hearts'
content. V/hen the outcome was no
longer in doubt thÂ° Berkeley men
danced the serpentine around the
track, headed by their band. John El
liott, the veteran authority on athlet
ics, acted as referee and ktpt the com
petition moving without a hitch. Lu
ther H. Cary, in his day the most fa
mous sprinter in America, handled the
starter's pistol.
The sensation of the day was the
performance of John Miller, the Stan
ford runner. He started first in the
miie, which he won in the rain in '4:41,
loss than four seconds outside the
record. Th â¢? versatile runner next made
his appearance as a sprinter in the
quarter-mile. He fairly romped away
with this, winning handily by three
yards in 54 1-5 seconds. After a short
rest he came out for th? half-mile and
was wildly cheered by the spectators. '
It was at once seen his previous ef
forts had sapped his strength, although
he ran with desperate gameness. He
was in next to last, position for a time
and finally wound up In third place.
His efforts told on him as he fairly
reeled off the track. Ed Mayes is said
to have been the only man to win three
events at an intercollegiate meet, tak
ing the 100, 220 and 440. Miller won
three events at Pomona, but there he
met inferior athletes to those compet
ing yesterday.
Stanford met its worst reverses late
in the day. Its representatives expect
ed to win the broad jump, but the Cal
ifornia men took all three places. Then
California won the high Jump, the pole
vault, the shot-put and the hammer
throw, which gave it a commanding
lead.
Snedigar of California loomed up as
a giant among the sprinters, not being
pressed in either of the sprints. The

. â  1 want to talk to men j who -feel old and slow; who don't have that fsprightHness;. that old ' courage and "go" that they used to have; those
men who always have the s feeling as if they had suddenly s:Fown : old; who have lost interest ,in lffe and pleasure.
â ;..; ', There, are several : kinds v of -weak':' men ; but every man-knows his own symptoms. 7 He knows that he has lost his "steam," and my object is
not so much to talk of. how he has lost it as to show' him what hitman "steam"' is and how- he can cct. it back.
! . . Protessor.-'Loeb.lthe' noted -scientist!, says "that human vitality is. based upon electricity. Great athletes and trainers of athletes are now twin*"
electricity to develop physical strength "and endurance. Doctors- who want to cure their patients now apply electricity in nearly all cases showing
a want of vitality.V The day of the stimulating drug is past. . ; <: , . -t. ' V ' '
You see they arc all coming to They wouldn't recommend my belt â still 'a few of the good doctors do recommend it when they care more
for a man's health /than they do for hi? dollars â but most of them call me a quack because I pay.for my advertising. But they all admit that elec-
tricity increases strength. That is all 1 claim for it. That is all you wajn. anyway. Tf you have enough strength you'll never be weak nor suffer a pain.
â \ It used to be considered, sensible to take drugs': to "wake up" sluggish* circulation, to stimulate weak nerves, to make the stomach take food
that it was too weak to digest, and, then another, drug to drive this food through the -intestines which were too weak to do their work. Men would
take drugs to make them -sleep and an eye-opener in * the morning to make ,them eel ; as if they had restedâ all dope.
It is well known now that nearly every drug contains from one-half to nine-tenths alcohol and the rest poison. I'm no advocate of the intem-
perate use of alcohol, but if; you 'have to : take it, why can't you take it without the poison? -It -is proven that in thirty minutes after a drug is
taken the physical vitality is five per cent lower than before taking the drug â that is, alter the stimulation - has passed off.
â¢ - Taking stimulants -is: like borrowing money/ for half "an hour at five per cent interest â you borrow a dollar and pay back a dollar five in half
an hour. that scheme kept up it would break your bank account. It will just as surely break you down physically. Wouldn't it?
Nature will .-land a great deal of punishment; but she will not stand it always. She gives' you a strong body to start with, and demands an
accounting. V '':'-^\/^ ', " :'â¢;-â â¢..;:â :.:.,..- â \.' : '. .".-"â  " 'â ' : â¢'- -',- ; ".'.â¢"' ----':":â â  *
X; My method is to help natureâ add artificial vitality to that you already have. 'Every one of us has a certain amount, according to oar
strength, because vitality is " strength. V- When you lose some of this vitality you arc weakâ a weak man. My appliance pours a fresh supply into
your body while you sleep. It generates electricity and pumps that into your nerves. Professor Loeb says that it is the basis of vitality, and my
cures prove 1 it. :â  ' "'" ''; 'â '\'-y -'.-. .-'â 'â ' .:â "'.,; â : S â ";... : .,.- ~ Â' : >' :\'../:: \'../ : â .' â¢-

In Talks in Parliament d:uiÂ£vil by
Columns in Newspapers â Pre
mier Balfour Leads.
Who are the greatest Parliamentry
talkers in England is shown by a
booklet compiled in the press gallery
of the House of Commons. The Prime
Minister heads the list.
At present In Parliament there are
only half a dozen men who have talked
half so much as Mr. Balfour. He
spoke 311 newspaper columns during
the session. Austin Chamberlain 237,
Sir llenry Campbell-Bannurman 200,
Wyndham 180 and Arnold Foster 169.
Lloyd George's record is 166 columns,
and Gibson Bowles was nearly as talk
ative, with four columns less. Next in
order come Sir Charles Dilke, 157;
Winston Churchill, 143, and Lord As
quith, 125.
Only three others spoke more than
100 columns, even Lord Hugh Cecil
rontributioa* only fifty-two columns of
talk. â¢
There is, only half as much talking
in the Lords as in the Commons. Lord
Lansdowne heads the list with 16C col
umns. Earl Spencer is second with 100,
Lord Salisbury and the Duke of Marl
borough are tied for third place with
eighty-two each.
There are many members of the
Commons whose voices are never heard
at all. Tollemache declaied the other
day that he has not spoken once In
twenty-four yoars.
There are others whose voices are
heard so seldom that they are not rec
ognized when they do speak. â New
York Herald.
Independent Waiters.
Mont was tried here and failed. An
attempt made a year or so ago to com
pel waiters to employ their own omni
buses also failed. An omnibus is a
man who clears away the dishes. In
European hotels he is employed by the
waiter. At Sherry's, Delnionico's and
the Waldorf the most experienced wait
erg get $30 a month. If they take a
day off it is at their own expense and
must put on a "sub." To command a
$30 position a waiter must speak two
or more languages. A large numbe
of guests who patronize the expenslv
hotels and restaurants cannot spea
English. Many of them cannot eve
read it. It gratifies them to find
waiter who can speak French or Ger
man. That is why French. German o
Swiss waiters, who are usually poly
glots. get a larger salary and reed 1 *
more in tips than Knglish-speakin
waiters.â Pittsburjr dispatch.

PAKASITK BL\MED FOR
SCARCITY OF SARDINES
French Scientist Making Experiments
Which Promise to Be of Good
Benefit to Fishermen.
French scientists have at last discov
ered what they believe to be the cause
of the hitherto inexplicable disappear
ance of sardines from different parts of
the French coasts.
These disappearances, at irregular In
tervals, have been the cause of great
misery and suffering to the population
of the distri< ts concerned, who live en
tirely from the sardine trade, and
scores of deaths from starvation follow
ed the last misfortune of this kind,
when, some two years ago, the sardines
disappeared in a few days as com
pletely as if there had never been any
in French waters.
Dr. Marcel Baudouin has returned to
Paris' after spending six months in the
Vendee department, and reports that
he has discovered a small parasite of a
crustacean type, very delicately formed
and bright in color, that fastens itself
upon the sardine, generally first upon
its eyes, and literally eats its way
through the fish's body.
Dr. Baudouin has brought back a
number of sardines still living, with the
parasite firmly fastened upon them,
and fn conjunction with other scien
tists in the states employ is studying
the means of destroying the parasite
without poisoning the water or intro
ducing into the body of the fish unde
sirable elements.
The whole coast of Western France is
watching with interest, and even anx
iety, these efforts, for the experts as
sert that the parasite is the only rea
sonable explanation of the decline in
the valuable sardine industry.âChica

Authorship Among Indians.
Of late years, according to the Kan
sas City Journal, the number of writers
among the Oherokees has greatly in
creased. There are historians in the
tribe whose works are used as text
books in the Indian schools, and who
are cited as authorities not to be dis
puted. There are also Indians' who
have written codes of law whicl
(o!+ being nut In permanent form had
been handed down from generation to
generation. The Indians to-day obey
these laws with a greater reverence
than they do the laws of the United
States. There are Indian novelists â
novelists who devote their time to en
tertaining the Indian mind with ro
mance, with entangled plots and blood
curdling climaxes. These books are
popular among the Indians. Edition
after edition of some works Is pub
lished, and they are read by warrior
and squaw alike.
Heavy Immigration From Russia.
It is natural that immigration from
Russia should increase about this
time, but the fart that the arrivals
from that country in the month of De
cember were about 50 per cent greater
than in the corresponding month of
1902 or 1902 suggests at least some gen
eral knowledge or premonition of Im
pending trouble beyond that due to the
war with Japan. It is merely a hint,
but It is enough to raise the question.
Commissioner Sargent says that if
present conditions continue the immi
gration of 1905 will be the largest ever
known. In that case It will approxi
mate a million, and under our lav^s
more than 150,000 will be enticed to be
made voters in five years. What is
done to fit them for the power they
will have in their hands?â Hartford

GIFT OF' NAPOLEON' T
GEM OF ANTIQUE SALE
Silver Lamp Presented to Princess
Pauline Causes Furore at
Auction.
Souvenirs of Napoleon's reign and
Colonial days received the preference)
yesterday at the sale of odd furniture
and bric-a-brac which was held at an
auction house at Eleventh and Wal
nut streets.
The star piece of the sale was an
Empire silver lamp, presented by the
Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte to Paul
ine Bonaparte and purchased at the
Borghese sale at Rome by Mrs. John
Mercer of Washington. When this ex
quisite lamp was put up a calm fell
over the audience of bidders for a mo
ment, and an instant later the air was
filled with all kinds of prices. M- i
and women who < ovetad the rare sou
venir strove with each other, and it
was with difficulty that the auctioneer
could hear the prices which they hurled
at him.
Starting at $liH> th^ price . soared
steadily until $190 was reached. Th-n
there was a lull in the bidding, ami the
souvenir was knocked down to a de
termined old man, who looked as if
he would have given twice that much
to capture the prize. Had it not been
for its historical associations, it is
doubtful if the lami> would have
brought more than $50 on its merits.
All of the- furniturf of the famous
Virginia soldier. Nathaniel Bacon,
found ready buyers. His mahogany
Chippendale sofa, covered in i-anary
silk, brought $90 after lively bidding.
Despite its _00 years, rhe piece hi cap
able of enduring another generation
of tete-a-tetes. Equally as durable in
his large oak armchair and footstool,
each upholstered in heavy leather. It
needed but a step in the imagination
of those 4tha saw them t<> see the old
fighter smoking his pipe and holding
his mug of ale. This old chair went
for $35. and two <> a k hall chairs to
match were knocked down for $_5
each.
Two full-length mirrors, which be
longed to Governor Sprigg of Maryland,
brought $39. ard other choice pieces
owned by Bacon wont ranidly at good
prices.â Philadelphia North American.
MAY BUILD RAILWAY
INTO COPPER RIVER
H_vÂ«neyers Need a Line to Develop
Rich Mining Properites
In Interior.
According to a statement credited to
Stephen Birch, manager of the HavÂ«
meyers' Alaska mining property, !_â¢
principals, while not anxious to engage
In railroad enterprises, may find it nec
essary to build a line from V aides to
the heart of the Copper River valley.
Its purposes is to facilitate the develop
ment of their Kennecott Mountain
mines, located 150 miles north and east
of VaJdex. The mines carry both cop
per and gold, but more of the flrÂ»t
named metal, and embrace a tract ot
about 3000 acres of the surface area of
the Kennecott Mountain. These mines
were located about six years ago and
were in litigation until some months
ago. It is said that millions of dollars
worth of ore is in sight, but until
cheaper transportation facilities arÂ«
had the mines cannot be worked to ad
vantage. At present it costs 15 cents
a pound for carrying provisions, ma
chinery, etc., from Seattle to the prop
erty.
The Alaska Midland has been incor
porated and if built will afford Alaska
people rapid transit to the interior.
The route to bÂ« followed is thÂ© Aber
rrombie military trail from Valdea to
Eagle City, with a possible extension
to Dawson City. Spurs are to be built
from the main line to Fairbanks and
tv the Bonanza group of copper mines.
Prominent men of Seattle are behind
tho project, which has yet to b*
financed.â New York Commercial.
The Highest Salaries.
S. C. T. Dodd, who has resigned as
seneral solicitor of the Standard Oil
Company,, probably drew the largest
salary of any Individual in the United
States. Mr. Dodd has for years drawn
an annual salary of $250,000. The only
other salary drawn by a lawyer which
an compare with this is that of Fran
cis Lynde Stetson/ who receives an an
nual retainer of $50,000 from J. P. Mor
gan & i Co. to have the first call upon
the services of Mr. Stetson. Whenever
he is consulted he receives an extra
fee. '.-.- Sir Clinton Dawklns. the head
of the "London branch of J. P. Morgan
* Co., receives an annual salary of
$250,000. In addition he receives a cer
tain percentage of the profits of the
firm, which during some years have
amounted to a larger . sum than his
guaranteed salary. Outside of Mr.
Dodd about the* largest salary drawn
by any individual in this country is
$100,000. A large number of persons
are â  known to draw this salary. The
largest salary drawn by any railroad
president is understood to "be .$73,000.
Both A. J. Cassatt and James J. Hill
are "said to draw this salary.â New

IN REALTY DEALS
HOTELS TO BE ENLARGED
Building Contracts Are Awarded and Many
Transactions Stimulate Buying.
tfc the award during the past week
aiding contracts amounting to
than $600,000 and with five orÂ»Bix
aggregating $600,000, v.hich brings
otal of transactions above the
000 mark, together with scores of
deal?, the record reads well for
Francisco. The larger sales of the
week were in the business section of
the city. But high-priced residence
leaity has also been sold at good flg-
urei. Lots in all portions of the city j
, removed from the business centers con- J
tinue to find ready buyers, and the area
of activity extends from the water
front on the east to the ocean on the
west.
Possibly as significant as any feature
affecting the realty market are the
plans lor providing greater accommo- j
dations for guests . that throng and j
crowd San Francisco's leading hotels. ]
This week the start will he made in j
moving the old Cosmos Club building j
in order that the St. Francis Hotel may I
add a great structure to the present I
bujlQing. The new part of the hotel will j
be .built as rapidly as possible. Con- j
tracts have been let during the week J
that has just closed for the interior fin- j
ish â¢ - other work on the Fairmont |
Hotel. Moneyed men see that the pres
ent hctel accommodations in the city

proof of confidence could well be asked
for than the investments in real prop
erty afford.

COAL WASHING PAYS
IX GREAT BRITAIN
Prices of Small Coal and Even of
Slack Greatly Enhanced by Dirt
Being Removed.
It is impossible to deny that Eng
lish colliery owners are indebted to
German manufacturers for the best
systems of coal washing. It .is well
known that the coal of the Westpha-
Uan and Prussian coal fields Is great
ly inferior to our own, being got from
a greatly disturbed area and thus
there are not only more bands of dirt,
stone, etc.. running through them,
but with highly Inclined seams there
is a greater likelihood of shale and
other foreign matter becoming inter
mixed during excavation and filling.
Hence arises the necessity for careful
washing, and the perfection of me
chanical appliances for doing It. On
the other hand, a large proportion of
British coal comes up large and clean
from the mines, requiring very little
picking before going into the wagons.
The small coal in many cases does not
contain any serious amount of dirt,
and so for many, years coal washing,
which has been a necessity in some
countries, has not been looked upon in
this light here.
But recently a change has taken
place and . the utility of washing coal
has been recognized. This is not 'be
cause the good seams of coal referred
to are becoming exhausted, nor be
cause there Is more dirt and slack
than formerly; it is simply because
colliery owners are 'finding that thin
ner And inferior seams can be worked
to advantage if good arrangements
are made for mechanically preparing
the coal for sale. At the same time
it is admitted that coal is now being:
washed which formerly was cons d
ered good enough for sale immediately
after screening, but this is due to tln>
fact that even fairly clean slack is
improved in price v.ith washing.
German and Irish Linens.
A connoisseur in good things said
the other day; "There are only three
things I am a crank about â fine linens,
fine china and books. You may have
aU the rfest. I believe I am as good
a judge of linens as the King of Eng
land is of women. I can stroll through
a hotel dining-room and tell at a
glance exactly where the napery was
manufactured. Here, for instance"â
we were in one of the newer and cost
lier hotels at the time â "you have a
German linen. It is presentable 1 ad
mit, but come across the street and
I'll, open your eyes." In the other
house he said: "Need I say anything
further? This linen is as white as
Fnmv.- Made and bleached in Ireland.
The other", German stuff, is yellow and
will always remain so. They cannot
just as yet bleach linens in the father
land. German linens are cheaper than
Irish, but they don't last half so long
and they soon look tawdry."^ â New

LADY CIIEYLESMORE SAVES
COUPLE PROM EVICTION
American Peeress Pays Rent for Aged
Pair and Restores Them to
Their Home.
recently, ins American peeress jias
done much practical work for ameli
orating the condition of the t>oor of
Westminster since her husband's elec
tion to the civil honor made her the
Lady Mayoress of the ancient boroueh.
Leaving Westminster Hospital, where
she had been visiting some of the pa
tienta â the other day-r-she ordered her
coachman to drive down some of the
side streets at the back of the Ameri
can Embassy In Victoria street. This
quarter abounds in wretched slums,
and its inhabitants, though surrounded
by wealth and luxury, are among the
poorest in London, and here many of
Lady Cheylesmore's personal pension
ers live.
Noticing outside the door of one of
the tenements a motley collection of
decrepit furniture she stopped the car
riage and started in to make a per
sonal investigation of the matter. Well
she knew that the presence of the
household goods on the sidewalk indi
cated that one of those tragedies of
the slumsâ an evictionâ had taken
place. What she wanted to find out
was whether the victims of it were de
serving of her assistance. She learned
that they were a worthy old couple
who in summer contrived to make a
precarious living by hawking fruit and
flowers, but in winter had to exist on
the scant outdoor parish relief supple
mented by what charitable neighbors
could afford to give them. She paid up
the arrears of rent.
She left a guarantee with the land
lord that she would be responsible for
its payment for the next six months.
She gave the old couple enough money
to provide them with sufficient food for
some weeks to come, and promising to
look them up when she next came that
way, took her departure, the aged
couple showering blessings upon her.
MORGAN AS A LOBBYIST
IN BRITISH PARLIAMENT
American Financier Endeavors to Se-
cure Favorable Action on
Railway Scheme.
LONDON, April 15. â During J. Pier
pont Morgan's recent stay in England
he was a frequent visitor at the houses
of Parliament and dined there one
evening as the guest of H. J. Tenant,
M. P. He was looking after his Lon
don railway schemes and seeking to
accelerate favorable legislation by
means of his personal influence among
members of both houses. He is ex
ceedingly anxious that his projects
should go through during the exist
ence of the present Parliament, be
cause he knows that when ths Rad
icals come into power he will encoun
ter strong opposition among those who
favor municipal as opposed to private
enterprise.
Although he has not so stated him
self, it is understood among lawyers
and parliamentary agents that if he
does not obtain the necessary sanction
at this session he will abandon further
efforts and waste no more time and
money on London railway schemes.
After his projects were rejected last
year he told a friend in the House of
Commons with whom he was discuss
ing British legislative methods that he
would find much more satisfaction in
bestowing on some charitable objects
the money he had expended in trying
to Americanize metropolitan transit.

MANY LARGE BONDS
PLACED ON MINES
Transactions in Nevada County Convince
Miners That Boom Is at Hand.
Big Dredging Scheme Is Interesting People
Who Live Along Yuba River.
A season of great mining activity
in the vicinity of Nevada City is pre
dicted by the people of that section.
Within a year more men will proba
bly be at work in the district than at
a.ny time in twenty years. In the last
six weeks many properties have been
bonded in figures running into the hun
dreds of thousands of dollars. George
C. Sargent, son of former United
States Senator Sargent, has bonded to
San Francisco parties certain proper
ties at Quaker Hill for $200,000.
Some new promise of development in
the gold-dredging industry in Califor
nia develops with each successive
week. No branch of mineral exploita
tion has progressed in this State with
equal rapidity since the never-to-be
forgotten days of placer mining, when
$50,000,000 a year could be washed
from the river sands by primitive
methods. The Feather and YuÂ»a riv
ers, the Sacramento River near Fol
som and other streams are still prom
ising fields for the investment of cap
ital.
The dredgers would seem, by all the
developments in new territoryi to
have a long lease of prosperity assured
to them. Just now activity is increas
ing. Ten dredgers will be ready for
use on the Yuba River before the close
of the present year. Two hulls have
been recently launched and two more
are in course of construction for the
Yuba Consolidated Goldflelds Com
pany.
The entire subject of dredging for
gold in California will be treated in a
bulletin that has been prepared by the
State Mining Bureau and will come
from the press in a few weeks. Prob
ably a supplement will be necessary
after a time, as new discoveries will
lead to the organization of more com
panies and a wider field of auriferous
sands.
Extensive dredging operations are
projected in the Yukon country by the
Canadian Klondike Company. A con
tract has been placed for one machine
that will cost $200,000. The Detroit-
Yukon Company will expend $225,000
for a dredging machine. The Northern
Lumber Company has contracted for a
$60,000 dredger to operate on Lower
Bonanza Creek. The Lewis River Com
pany is operating one of the same size
on Bonanza.
New Scheme Is Launched.
The Marysville Democrat reports that
the most extensive deal in Yuba Coun
ty dredging lands will soon be carried
out. In part the Democrat says:
A. G. Hanford haa lour drill* at work on
lands along the Yuba Klver that have txen
under bond for some time. Ha haa bonds od
lands on the north aide of the river as fol
lows: Kupger, 000 acres; Shay, 180; Dlggs.
1100; Pauley. O-Brten, Ebert and Mitch
ell, 200; on the south side, O'Brien uncluding
Beeney place), 4oC4> acres; Mahoney, 160; Cur
ry. 320, and Reynolds. 240. In addition 1400
acres of land within the meander lines of the
Yuba River, recently located by J. E. Ebert
and others have been bonded. This lies be
tween the tracts above named. Almost all
these are patented lands.
The drills have been at work for four or flva
months and are now on the Pauley place.
Three more machines will bÂ« on the ground
soon and will aid in hurryin* the work of
prospecting. Surveyors are engaged in running
lines, and everything points to the final clos
ing of a deal.
The Auburn Herald saye, concerning
dredging ground in Placer County:
It has often been wondered at by parties
who know why the vaÂ»t deposits of drjedging
ground on Auburn ravine from Gold Hill to
the â¢'overflow" In Butter County have never
been examined and reported on by competent
experts. Auburn ravine has been phenomenal
ly rich from Auburn to Lincoln as far as it
could be worked by sluicing; in fact, mining
only stopped when the banks got too high and
the ground too flat for sluicing. The wash
from the rich hills of gravel and from the
veins made a string of camps from Auburn
to Civil Usage, to Ophlr. to Freytown, New
town. Gold Hill, Virginiatown, Fort Trojan
and Lincoln. From there on to where Auburn
ravine spreads out on the plains and loses iUÂ«lf
In the â¢â¢backwater" is a virgin country of the
richest dredger ground in the State, and" a
good deal of the land Is valueless for any other
purpose, being a lake in winter and a swamp
in summer, roamed at will by wild hogs and
deer, who find safety In the Impassable Jungles
of brambles and timber.
Some Northern Smelters.
It has been decided that the Balaklala
emelter shall be located at Kennett.
The Balaklala group of mines include
a tract of 1500 acres. Roads make good
lines of communication to the smelter
site from a number of mines. On the
Balaklala group are twenty-one tun
nels, ranging in length from 60 to 750
feet. The Redding Searchlight says:
The company that made three surveys wai
composed of flirewd and careful men who used
every device known In modern engineering,
first to locate a line at reasonable cost to Cop
ley only to find their error. The next desir
able nolnt was a site on Squaw Crfr;k, a short
distance from where it empties Into the Sac
ramento River. This line, too. proved a fail
ure As 'a- "last resort the third was chosen.
It is snld that the Mammoth company first
contemplated the erection of its great smelter
on the Squaw Creek site, but on more mature
deliberation decided on the present place. The
grade is easy from the Windy Camp, the Trin
ity Copper, the Great Verde group, the Vir
ginia Mining Company's group formerly known
ac the Uncle Sam gold mine, the Cllpper-Sny
iler the Lowden-FTlday, Mammoth and the
Graves group, situated on the benchland be
tween the headwaters of Squaw. Little Back
bone and Big Backbone creeks. The Gollnsky
group of mines that lies the farthest north on
tlie Kreat belt has been prospected to a suffi
cient depth to Insure values. The several
mines could be worked to much better ad
vantage with a plant as above than from any
other point.
The smelter of the Mammoth Copper
Company at Kennett will probably be
ready to use in August.
The Gould. mine at lowa Hill, Placer
County, will be opened by the Rossi
brothers, who will prospect for a chan
nel that has never been tried.
Gravel has been struck in the Straw
berry mine at Monona Flat, near lowa
Hill.
A deal for the Ecllpae-Morning Star
property Is reported to be progressing
well.
The Calaveras Prospect reports that
large operations will be undertaken at
Marconi Flat in connection with the
Chase ditch on the San Domingo by the
hydraulic process.
The Polar Star mine in Nevada
County will soon resume operations.
The Golden Gate Consolidated Gold
and Silver Mining Company has ac
quired the Norambagua mine in Ne
vada County.
THE CLIO MIXING DEAL.
The Tuolumne Independent gives the
following particulars relating to the
bonding of the Clio quartz mine and
millsite near Jacksonville:
TliÂ«. Clio Mining Company has agreed to
?ell td Henry Malmgren or Los Angeles the
Clio quart?; mils and mill site, both being
patented for the sum of $05,000. The prop
erty is ' situated nour Jacksonville ana the
mill, all machinery, tools, etc, go with the
mine The final payment ta to be made In
twtiity-Bix months in Installments as follows:
Twenty thousand dollars within fourteen
months from date. SlO.Cco within twenty
months from date and the balance of $26,000
within twenty -six months at Boston, Mass.
Tii- nurd aser Is to pay to the Clio Company
2.1 per cent of the gross proceeds of all orÂ«
t":;tr.utci! and milled to apply on the purchase
prtc*.
The Nevada City Transcript reports
that the company owning the Sierra
Queen mine will be reorganized and
that work will be resumed soon.
The Sunset Gold Gravel Mining Com
pany has been organized to operate the
Independence gold mine near Angels '
Camp. The old company exhausted :
the money received from the sale of
stock after doing a large amount of
work and as the stock was n>->n-assess
able it was thought best to reincor
porate under the laws of California
with the same amount of capital stuck ,
as the old company had.
A transaction of some interest In re- i
gard to the Lappln mine in Trinity
County is reported by the Redding
Searchlight. James J. Chambers had
a working option on the mine, which
is at Deadwood. He took out a quan
tity of ore and milled it. He then be
came financially embarrassed and gave
the miners that he had employed per
mission to take out more ore and have
it reduced, that they might recover the
wages that were due them. After they
secured their wages in this way the
miners, acting under the advice Â«f
Chambers, turned $1200 over to Mrs.
Paulsen, the proceeds of the ore above
the amount that was required to satisfy
their claims. Then the owners of the
mine. M. A. Brady and others, sued to
recover from Mrs. Paulsen and Cham
bers the $1200, Chambers having failed
to meet his obligations to them. The
Superior Court has decided that Mrs.
Paulsen shall retain the money that
was paid her during the life of the
working option on the mine.
The Davis quartz mine, near Sugar
Pine, Tuolumne County, has been
bonded by' Dr. Allen of Los Angeles.
The Beals quartz mine has been deed
ed by Nathanial Screech and A. J.
Blackwell to the National Park Elec- !
trie Company.
The Amador Ledger says:
At a meeting uof .the .directors of! the. Eel J
Monte mint an - assessment of 10 cents per â¢
share waa levied upon the ' capital stock. This '
assessment Is for the purpose of meeting obli- ;
gations of the I company on the - purchase . price j
Ml the property, which falls due In June. The ;
prospecting operations at the depth of 500 feet i
have developed an ore body at one point carry- !
Ing about $3 SO per ton, which is not a paying â¢
grade with a small mill such as the mine Is i
now equipped with. The management has faith
that further exploration upward- will lead to
the : uncovering of good ore. such as. was en- ,
countered in the upper levels. -
The aim of the American Mining i
Congress to establish permanent head- ,
quarters at Denver has at last a fair
chance to be realized. The directors
have outlined â¢' plans for the construc
tion of a permanent building to be
erected in Denver. It â¢is proposed to I
collect in this building a complete com-,
mercial exhibition of the mineral prod
ucts of the United States and also an
extensive library I devoted .to mining
subjects. A bureau of Information and
a complete organization to . work for ;
mining legislation by ; State and Na- . j
tional Governments . are also included !
In â  the ambitious plans. The entire '
subject will come up : for final ratiflca- \
tion before " the . Mining Congress at
the next annual session to be held at I
El Paso in September.
SOPHOMORES STEAL TRAIN
CHARTERED FOR FRESHMEN
Efforts of Big Students to Spoil Ban-
quet of Youngsters Meet With
Defeat.
TERRE HAUTE, Ind., April 15.âDe
claring that they were freshmen, Rose
Polytechnic sophomores secured pos
session of a special Vandalia train
which had been chartered to carry
freshmen to Marshall, 111., where they
were to attend a banquet. The fresh
men, who were assembled at Third
street, where they were to have board
ed the train, realized when the train,
crowded with yelling students, rushed
past, that they had been tricked and
another special was chartered to carry
them to Marshall.
In the meantime those in charge of
the banquet, who had been informed
of the trick by telephone, refused to
admit the sophomores. By leaving the
train outside the city and making a
detour the freshmen secured admission
to the banquet hall, where they bar
ricaded the doors and participated in
the festivities. Outside the hall the
Sheriff and deputies patrolled the
grounds to prevent a possible attempt
on the part of the second class men to
obtain admission.

The first cargo of American raw sul
phur, consisting of 3000 tons, v.a^ ship

| prospect that ' American shippers ' will

I American producers offer a sulphur 99.9

3D cents less than the above-quoted
â¢prices in 1597, and were offered under
! the stress of exceptional conditions In
Sicily, .tÂ».t the general meeting of the

in London, the chairman" reported gross
I profits amounting; to $914,430, against
â¢ $752,590 'In the previous year. .Exports
had Increased 20,000 tons. .
The chairman warned the sharehold
ers that , the company was a trading
! concern and liable to the vicissitudes
of trade. Sicily, he said. had. been
. virtually " the sulphur producer of the
world, and there had been practically
no serious competition from other
sources; but It was this year threat
ened with competition by certain mines .
in Louisiana, where It was claimed
that a considerable quantity of sul
phur could be produced.
. METHOD OF EXTRACTION. '.'
Our American sulphur deposits- were
discovered - In , Calcasieu parish. La.,
; thirty-five years ago. while ; petroleum
boring- was in progress. The sulphur
' found was practically useless, however.
! being buried under 400 feet of aulck
; sand. ; The rock being porous and filled
( with water containing sulphureted hy
drogen, the sinking of shafts was im
possible by old methods. After millions
i of dollars had been spent in attempts
to reach the sulphur, it was decided by
Herman Frasch to extract it by the ap
plication of water, superheated under
pressure to many degrees above boiling
point. It is then forced by means of.
â  iron : pipes into the sulphur rock. -The
; sulphur, being Insoluble : In water and
of greater specific gravity, falls to the
bottom of the well or deposit, from
which point it is raised to the surface
by. means of an air pump. On the sur-
I face it is allowed to congeal, and Is
I then ready for shipment.
i The entry of Louisiana sulphur into
the world's market is an unmistakable
triumph for American ingenuity and
commercial courage, which has brought
its own prompt rewardâ New" York

CRAB FISHERMAN NARROWLY ESCAPES
DROWNING WHEN BOAT IS SWAMPED
VincentPancesbana
Saved by His
Brother.
Launch Struck by
Sea Sinks Off
Mile Rock.
The life of a crab fisherman has
*ull share of peril, and VTncent
Pancesbana yesterday experienced one
of the thrills common to his calling
when his launch, rwamped by a big
sea, went down under his feet and
left 1. n etrugglms in the troubled
waters off Mile Rock. Fortunately for
Vincent his brother, Pasquala, was
near by in another launch. Pasquala
hooked on his little gasoline engine
and raced for his brother, who was
nearly exhausted when Pasquala's
hand took a strong- hold of his hair.
Vincent was pulled aboard his
brother's launch, where he shook him
self, like a dog after a swim, took a
â¢ong pull at the demijohn of vino and
then forgot his recent peril. Until
dark half a dozen launches dragged
for the sunken boat, but without lo
cating it.

PUTILOFF IRON
WORKS CLOSED
Twelve Thousand Idle Work
men May Clash With the
Czar's Cossacks To-Day
ST. PETERSBURG. April 15.âSev
eral squadrons of Cossacks have been
brought in to reinforce the garrison of
St. Petersburg in consequence of the
fears of a renewal of disorders. The
peasant movement in the neighborhood
of Moscow also is inspiring serious ap
prehensions.
The Putiloff Works Lave been closed.
A notice on the gates says it is due to
the unreasonable demai.ds of the men,
the threatening ' of the officials, fre
quent interruptions of work and disre
gard for the rules. Several squadrons
of dragoons, detachments of grenadiers
and a regiment of sharpshooters have
been stationed near the wo-rks all day.
The outbreak at the Putiloff Iron
Works originated because of a scheme
of the employes to make the burial of
men who were killed in a recent ac
cident in the works a grand political
demonstration. The workmen proposed
to have interment made in the Smo
lensk Cemetery, which is in Vaasili Os
trov, opposite the city, and which
would involve a five-mile parade of the
12,000 workmen directly through the
heart of the city. The police insisted
that interment take place in a ceme
tery near the works, but the workmen
refused and it is reported will endeavor
to carry out their programme to-mor
row, which will mean certain conflict
with the police and Cossacks.
Emperor Nicholas has decided that
the moment is inopportune to grant the
petition of. a group of the influential
clergy for a convocation of a general
council to effect a reform of the ec
clesiastical administration. On the
margin of the petition the Emperor
appended a note as follows:
"I find it impossible in the present
disturbed times to undertake a task of
such magnitude, requiring calm con
sideration. Following the old example
of the orthodox Emperors, I intend,
however, as soon as there is a favor
able moment, to set on foot this great
work and summon the council of the
old Russian church for a canonical dis
cussion vt questions of faith and ec
clesiastical reform."
MOSCOW, April 15.â The liberal con
servatives, who oppose constitutional
ism aa contrary to the genus of Rus
sian life, but who favor the restora
tion of, the ancient zemsky zabor, have
formed an organization to fight the
revolutionary constitutional propagan
da. The organization shortly will be
extended to St. Petersburg and other
large centers, when a programme will
be published and an appeal will be is
sued to the liberal conservatives to
combat the present radical agitation.
WARSAW. April 15.â Three workmen
accused of having wounded a police
man during the January riots were to
day sentenced to death, after a trial
by court-martial.
LODZ, April 15. â Two workmen shot
and killed a policeman in the streets
to-day. One of the assassins was ar
rested.
DEATH'S SHADOW IX PICTURE.
Half-Tone Shows Royal Family Lying
Dead in Coffins.
i. ST. PETERSBURG, April 15.â
1 Quite a sensation was caused ; this
; morning by the appearance in. the
Neva, the most largely circulated il
i lustrated, weekly in Russia, of a half
â  tone picture representing the imperial

I Grand Duke Sergius, " Grand";'' Duke
Alexis, the' Dowager; Empress, : : the
heir, to the throne and' : practically all
the" living members of the 'Romanoff
family lying dead in their coffins. The
! work is done so skillfully that in the
shadows in the , drapery behind -:\ the
imperial family Is discernible ; with
great - difficulty. The 7 publishers dis
claim any previous â  knowledge â of the
shadowy figures.* The ' culprits, who

James O'Rourke an Heir.
Postmaster Fisk received a letter
yesterday from Joseph F. Eckard of

HKLD UP BY ROBBERS
ON FOLSOM STREET
Two Men Take Small Sum From M.
Barry and One Is Captured
by Police.
M. Barry was held up at the points
of revolvers by two men at Sixth and
Folsc-m streets this morning shortly
after midnight. The robbers secured
$2 75. One of them, who gives the
name of John Power, was captured
after an exciting chase by Policemen
Farrell and Looney. He was booked
at the Southern station on a charge
of robbery.
Barry was on his way home, and as
he neared the corner of Sixth and Fol
som streets two men sprang out of a
doorway and covered him with pistols.
They wore no masks. While one kept
his revolver leveled at Barry the other
went through the victim's pockets and
extracted all hfs money. No attention
was paid to his wtach. As soon as the
robbers had gone Barry called for the
police. Officers Farrell and Looney
caught Power and are searching for
his confederate.
Bombarded Him With Bottles.
With dimpled babe in arms, Mrs.
Bertha Fisher, petite and handsome,
told Judge Cabaniss that she threw
empty bottles at Abraham Kornblum,
diminutive and bald-headed, because
his language had provoked her to do so.
The Fishers and the Kornblums are
next-door neighbors on the 400 block of
Ivy avenue, and the masculine head of
each family peddles fruit for a liveli
hood. It was while Mr. Kornblum and
his wagon were passing the Fisher
domicile that Mrs. Fisher cast the bot
tles.
"I did it," said Mrs. Fisher, "because
he called me ugly names in English
when nobody but me could hear him,
and he called them in Yiddish when
people were present who did not under
stand that language."
"I haven't spoken Yiddish for twenty
years," Mr. .Kornblum declared.
"In other words, Mrs. Fisher," quoth
the court, "he hurled epithets at you
and you hurled bottles at him."
"Yes, sir," responded the defendant.
"Well, in accordance with the theory
that fair exchange is no robbery, you
are less to blame than he is, for he
started the exchange. Come back here
one month from to-day and let me
know how you have got along with the
Kornblums in the interim."
Then the baby cooed at the Judge,
and the Judge, who is a paterfamilias,
complimented Mrs. Fisher on the evi
dences of her good care displayed by
the little one.

Autos Have Come to Stay.
A Pittsburg officer of the Auto Club
says there are only 500 machines in
use in that city, but he predicts that
there will be 1000 before the first of
the next year. There is a real auto
"craze" to-day, and it is not likely to
die out, for the reason that touring,
while it makes a considerable drain on
the pocket, makes none on the nerv
ous system unless the car is sent along
at the rate of a locomotive. Those who
are asking for legislation regulating
the use of autos must consider that
no amount of legislation can drive
these machines off the public highway.
There is such a demand for them, they
are so high in favor, that almost every
one would ride in them if he could.
Legislation must therefore take the
form of compromise, although it may
be expedient to build special roads for
the racing machines. â Pittsburg Dis

of th* copper market: "The activity in the
Utah Company stock continued to-day, with
BlUgham the feature. The buying of this stock
" excellent and the closing was the highest
of the day. Boston Consolidated seemed to
be .coming out rather freely around $8 50. but
tne buying was sufficient .to absorb all the
stock offered. Parrott. which broke badly yes

The Bean Trade. ; ;'.-:":
The circular of Webster & Dunbar says of
Beans: The- number of sacks of ell kinds of
beans reported In the State of California. April,
1905; is estimated as follows:
Sacks.
Bar Francisco warehtsMes and wharves. 145,725
Northern counties 130.000
Southern c0untie5.........: .-.. 140.000
T0ta1.. .................... ...... 415,725
Segregated as to ntrietles:
Backs. '
Pinks 160,000
Limas " 70,000 '
Large white* or Lady WasMngtone. . . . 65,000
Email whites 48.000
Dayos 40,000 .
Black eyes 22,000
Various - 10,725
Total 415.725
The general bean trade at the moment is
quiet and triihout special feature, due prob- i
ably to the remarkably heavy shipments east
ward last month â¢March*, irtiich have tempo- i
rarily filled up the Eastern markets. Ship
ments eastward during the month of March
amounted to ISS cars, or about 92,500 sacks.
Michigan markets report shortage and poor :
quality. an<l New York high prices, light stocks
and txjort movement to Europe instead of
imjxirtfc to America. The Eastern situation is
quite btrtttsh. â 
The present California stocks are large, ex
crpt at to Limas and Blackeyes, and in the .
i.tse'nce of a demand equal to the March trade j
Â»efw-*en now and October. 1905 (new crop pe
riod), there will st a large carry-over. The !
railroad companies have been approached for a j
thirtj'-day emergency rate of 50 cents to Mis- i
touri River points rate 75 cents), but !
probably with" little success, as the companies
ur-jally t-jin fiowo such propositions. Reduc
tion in """"anern freights would materially help
the *ituaticn and permit heavy shipments east
ward, thus. reducing the large stocks.
There is a scarcity of enoice, sound, clean
beans cf ail varieties, but a very large amount j
cf rain-rtamtgei stock, whlcn must be moved |
befoni the hot weather sets in. as they turn in
color ana eat. This especially applies to the
color varieties. â¢
Weather condition.* from now on will have
much to do In shaping demand and value*,
Excessive raine or â¢ extreme ry weather will j
have much to do in -changing the present -mar- ;
krt comptexVjn. ' â¢
Th-j circular also says that present indica
tions are for very large crops of potatoes and
onions. The weather has been very favorable
to growjng crops, and in many sections new
I-otatoes and onions re from thirty to fifty
days earlier than usual.

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. April 15.â Notwithstanding a
sharp decline at Liverpool, due to predictions
of a liberal inrrcuse in world's shij.mcnts, the
wheat market here opened firm. Initial quo
tations of July were up % to ftc at &7%c to
88c. May was up % to ; l^ciat $1 15% to
$1 ' 16. - - One > cause : of the opening strength i was
a': decided ' drop . in , temperature â¢ throughout - the
, West â¢ end Southwest. â¢â  The strength of May
wvis^due to Information : from Minneapolis that
May \- wheat :; : there was =;, up ;; over lc fon 'â --. the
curb. In' the â  Northwest' snow was -reported in
many " Beet lons. ,'- Sentiment i soon * became â  bear
ish however, -on; selling of May by houses;
supposed to be, acting for a Wall-street coterie,"
A prominent long : here was i also credited v with;
selling May.' . Within a short time" the: price
Of May had descended to SI 14. r The break
In - May â¢ had ; a "." weakening ?â  lnfluence '.' on ' the
more distant > futures. v:i July gradually de
clined to B<%c. :â â¢â .; An i increase â¢in primary - re
ceipts tended also to. create Bearish sentiment.
Later, however, future deliveries became quite
firm on covering. by 6hortÂ». : > Part of z the 'buy-
Ing resulted from a few additional reports of
damage to the crop in Nebraska.'.*, Another fac
tor was a forecast of extreme I cold Â« weather.
ThÂ« demand â¢ was sufficient to â¢: force â ' July up
to 88%@8SV4c. The May delivery,: however,
was ' Inclined -to i drag under persistent selling
by > influential â  traders. At the, close 'July sold
at'B7%o. May closed at $1 14%. -^'- ..,.-. â  ;
, The r chief . feature of * trading in '. the ..;. corn

which ruled very weak at "a lower range of
prices. All the other vegetables werÂ» firm.
there being a good shipping demand In addi
tion to the regular trade. Tomatoes and Sum

and Mexican Peppers cold readily at 280 per

Poultry and Game.
As Is usually the case on Saturday, there was
very little Poultry received and trade was
quiet, but the market had a firm tons and
was bare of good stock at the close. Receipts
were moderate during the past week and large
chickens, Geese and Ducks cleaned up promptly
at firm prices from day to day, while small
Broilers and Squabs were neglected and
handlers were obliged to cut prices in order to
effect clearances of those descriptions. Pour
cars of Western were handled during the week.
Receipts of Hare and Rabbits have been rery
light for some time and prices have been sta
tionary for several days.

Butter, Cheese and Etres.
Receipts of Butter continue, liberal, but ars
â very wejl absorbed owing, as already eald. to
the storing and shipments, which, while not
large, make up a very respectable amount in,
the aggregate. Two cars have been made up
for the East during the past week, and it waa
reported yesterday that another was to bs
made up In Sonoma County if possible. But it
Is said that these will end the Eastern ship
ments. The rain has a tendency to weaken the
market by prolonging the green feed season.
A growing weakness In Cheese Is reported,
though quotations are. no lower.
Continued firmness in Eggs Is noted, with
the cheaper grades meeting with the beet de
mand, as already mentioned. The latter have
advanced somewhat lately, but ranch remain
unchanged.

variety. The Whites sold at $1 75 per drawer,
while the Guignea were not sold up to a late
hour. Receipts of Strawberries were nearly
200 chests, but trade was quite active and
prices were well maintained. Well-colored
berries sold readily at good prices, while green
and gandy offerings continued to drag at easy
rateÃ ami a good portion of the receipts of the
large varieties went to peddlers at the inside
quotation. Trade In Oranges was quiet owing
to the rain, but there were no fresh arrivals
and the market remained firm for all grades.

HARVARD MAN
EATS GARBAGE
College Graduate, Slave to
Cocaine, Sinks to Lowest
Deptlis of Degradation
AVHINES FOE THE DBUG
Edward Burling, the Son of
Wealtliy Parents, Is Now
a Wan and Pitiful Wreck
Pleading lnoesaaatly . In a voice that
is a pltilul whine for a little cocaine,
Edward Burling, a graduate of Har
vard University, is locked In a cell at
the detention ward of the Central
Emergency Hospital His cheeks are
sunken, his eyes are vacant of intelli
gence and his body -is :â¢ thin and
shrunken. â¢ ..
"Ye 6, 1 \rent to Harvard. I was In
the class of '8Â»." he said. "Can't you
get me some cocaine? For God's sake,
get me some. When I don't get it I
think and that is hell for me."
All the manhood he once had is gone.
He vanta nothing now but enough of
the drug to kÂ«Â«p him stupefied. He
â would 6ell his soul for it.
For several weeks Burling has been j
lurking In the Western Addition llv- j
Ing on scraps of food he pilfered from
garbage caps. To get money to buy
cocaine he begged and stole. Some
times he worked, but that was seldom.
Onoe Burling had wealthy parent*
who were very proud of their son. Burl-
Ing seldom thinks of them or his previ- i
cus claims to respectability unless to ]
ÃBe thÂ«lr names in his whine for the (
drug. When he first fell Burllng's :
parent* did not cast him off. They
sent him to private hospitals to try to j
heve the spark of manhood rekindled. |
Bnt the effort was useless.
The mother died of a broken heart. S
Barling immediately used the affliction â 
In pleading for the drug. All manhood :
died in him.
"YeÂ«, I had money once and good
people. That waa a long time ago.
Please get roÂ« some cocaine. Oh, for
God* sake, get me some quickly."
And he stretches an arm like a skele
ton's through the wicket whining and
crying like a starving animal.
He le 45 years of age. He has nothing
left but hie fierce craving for the drug
that liolds him a clave.

This bit of news was received yester

went to Lieutenant Commander Knapp
and protested against hie treatment of

Solace here the surgeon, as was pub

ten days. Boatswain Glynn, who also
protested to the executive officer, has
since been subjected to the most rigid
discipline. The fact that these two

an unfortunate woman, incurred the en

A movement was recently inagurat<?d
to have Knapp detached from the So

Lieutenant Commander Knapp aboard

officers, but has extended to the crew,

his seemingly ungentlemanly conduct

COURT SUSTAINS
THE GRAND JURY
Judge J, aw lor Denies Motion
3iade to Quash Indict
ment Against Maestretti
EFFORT TO PROVE BIAS
Budd Attempts to Show That
an Ahti - Administration
Feeling Inspired Charge
After seven grand jurors had been
questioned yesterday, Judge Lawlor
denied a motion to set aside the in
dictment of perjury against Frank A.
Maestretti for subornation of perjury.
The motion \v:is made on the ground
that the Grand Jury was biased, but
the court found nothing to support
the allegation. The decision on the
demurrer- fiied by the defendant was
postponed until next Saturday.
The hen ring on the motion to set
aside started some sharp verbal
skirmishiVig between District Attorney
Byiuglon and ex-Governor Budd, who
appeared for the defendant. He WM
assisted by Henry C. Dibbie. Budd
devoted most of his energies to ques
tioning George A. Newhall, but found
him a difficult witness.
"Are you a member of the Mer
chants' Association?" Budd began.
"I am," was the reply.
"Do you know Fairfax Wheelan ?"
"I do."
"Did you ever conusult him about
the necessity of wresting the ad
miniÃtratlon from Schmitz for the
public good?"
The District Attorney quickly in
terposed an objection.
"It is a notorious fact," declared
Budd, "that Wheelan represents one
faction and Maestretti another. The
question is asked to show prejudice."
Newhall declared that he had never
consulted Wheelan regarding the oust
ing of Schmitz and that he had never
mentioned the name of Maestretti to
him. He asserted positively that his
action in regard to the finding of the
indictment was not in the least in
fluenced by the retirement of Fore
men Andrews and the committee
which had made the investigation.
The oth<r grand jurors examined
were William V. Bryan. John Porcher,
K. \V. Bowes, J. T. Sullivan, James P.
Smith, George A. Hare and Foreman
Andrews. They were all questioned
on similar lines. None of them gave
testimony that would show they were
prejudiced.
After much bickering it was brought
out through Secretary William J.
Bryan that the proceedings in the
Maestretti case had not been taken
down by the official stenographer of
the Grand Jury. Budd demanded that
the credentials of the stenographer
who he'd taken them be produced, but
Ihe court decided that they were ir
relevant.
"Th<> motion to set aside is denied,"
announced Judge Lawlor when the
last witness had been examined.
Then Budd made an attempt to show
flaws in the indictment. All the legal
lore on subornation of perjury was
produced and . the attorneys for the
defendant took turns in expounding it.
The defense was given three days
to file its authorities and the District
Attorney the same length of time to
tile an answer. The court will decide
on the demurrer Saturday.
Maestretti is accused of inducing C.
M. Silverstein to give perjured testi
mony in the Wyman case. Maestretti
was present durinj? the hearing.
Says SBJesraan b Defaulter.
Frapk Curry, representing C. B.
Splivalo & Co., 347 Sacramento street,
obtained Jt warrant from Police Judge
Cabanis* yesterday for tbp arrest- of
G. Ravizza on a charge of felony em
bezzlement. Ravizza was employed
as a salesman and although he had no
authority to make collections it is al
leged he collected $109 50 on April 13
and appropriated the money. It is
said there are other amounts.
Cook Raises Disturbance
