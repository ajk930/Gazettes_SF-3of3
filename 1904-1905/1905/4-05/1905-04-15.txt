ST. PETERSBURG. April IB.â ln re- |

Moscow yesterday (Friday) Finance j
Minister Kolovsoff gave notice to the !
â¢workmen of Russia that a Government I
commission is now formulating legisla- ;
tion to remedy the greater part of their
grievances, including state insurance!
against sickness, accident and death
and for shortening the hours of labor, :
abolishing prohibition of unions and
criminal punishment for strikes, and '
tor the establishment of an industrial
court in which employers and employed ;
thail be represented. The Minister j
pointed out to the delegation the. im- i
possibility of elaborating in a moment
legislation of such weighty end far- ,
reaching character. He declared that,
the energy with which the commission j
is working: gave it the right to demand
sufficient time for the preparation and
consideration of the proposed laws

such as have occurred hamper instead
of further the work. . - ,
The Moscow workmen presented a

ihe Minister BS.id the commission' was .
considering the widening of the sphere,
of action of the "factory elders" on
tne lines of the factories commit
of Germany in regard to restrictions
as to overtime, but on the further
points of technical education of work
men, extension of factory legislation \
to cover handiwork industries and the
revision of existing laws so as to place |
workmen and employers on an equal i
footing, he declared that education j
was not in the province of the Minister ;
of Finance. Handiwork legislation, he
eaid, was a big question, which would
have to be approached later, and the
workmen must be prepared to accept
equal responsibility with equal privi
leges.

it; another indication of the general
conciliatory spirit of the Government. j
The evident desire to cure. " wherever
possible, the maladies of the empire is '
manifested by the peasant commission,
the Finnish and Polish concessions and
the establishment of the Boulican com
mission. The Government throughout
takes the stand that all these reforms
are too gTeat to be lightly or hastily i
handled, and that premature and ill
considered legislation would be worse
than none at all. It appeals to the dis- j
satisfied to give their rulers a full and
fair chance to accomplish the legisla
tion they demand.

OMAHA. Sfh.. April 14.-After suc
cessfully baffling the police for five
months, a trio of boy bandits have been
landed behind the bars. They have
confessed to a series of more than a
dozen holdups and robberies. The
prisoners are 17, 18 and 20 years of
age, respectively. Their names are
L. J. Hossrnan. Frank Weber and Guv
G. Nestle.
Hossman and Weber were captured
yesterday, after a derperate fighv
while attempting to hoid up a South'
Omaha saloon. Nestle, who escaped at
the time, was arrested at his home
this afternoon, where he had barri
caded himself in his bedroom, in com

The youths had been extraordinarily
successful in their crimes. Their plun
der runs up into thousands of dollars
They held up half a dozen saloons, be
sides hardware, grocery and drug
stores and several outlying residences.
One day in December they committed
four crimes in quick succession. First
they held up a farmer west of South
Omaha and robbed him of $25 and a
gold watch. They then came into
South Omaha, where they held up two
saloons at the point of revolvers, get
ting away with several hundred dol
lars. They next stole a horse and
buggy and on the outskirts of Omaha
held up a street car.

RACINE, Wie., April 14. â Because
of a strike among the dining-room

wife of a wealthy Racine manufactur

of the hotel entered the room this
morning for their breakfast they
found no waiters. The two ladies,

LONDON', April 14.â "Farewell!
Rejoice: He goes back to his home
with his duty well and nobly done,
taking the universal respect and ad
miration of a kindred nation and his
own.'
This concluded Lord Chancellor
Halsbury's tribute at parting with
American Embasaador Choate, who
recently was distinguished by election
as a member ot the Middle Temple
and who to-night was honored by thn
greatest gathering of the bench and
bar in the history of the Inns of
Court. The Attorney General. Sir R.
B. Finlay, seconded the toast, saying.
"This is do ordinary occasion. Never
has a worthier man occupied the post
of Embassador to Great Britain and
none has carried away deeper affec
tion. Never was there a more wel
come guest at the Inns than this con
summate advocate, ereat diplomatist
and genial man of the world."
The assembly was jan extraordinary
one in character and numbered nearly
00 members ;of - the bench-. and bar,
Including almost- every leading: Justice
and barrister in ..England. Choate sat
between Lord ? Halabury .'and ! Lord Mc-
Nughten. Lord of Appeal.. in Ordinary.
Then ranged on . both sides were the
venerable^, Privy Councilors. ;, each
wearing his decorations arid " orders,

AIR OF OLDEN TIMES.
The great dining hall of the Middle
Temple is a vast oaken chamber, its
high roof supported by heavy beams,
the sides of the walls paneled with
Insets of coats of arms. Its windows of
stained glass. At one end of the hall
is Watt's masterpiece of fresco. "â¢Legis
lation," representing lawmakers from
the timp of Moses. At the other end is
a screened musicians' gallery orna
mented with wonderfully carved life
sized figures. It was occupied to-nlcht
by a number of lady guests, not dining,
but simply looking on.
On high movable pedestals hupe
roasts were carved before the eruests
by the Inn's carver perched above the
assembly. The entice scene had a
strange but delightful old world air.
As the guests took their places they
remained standing until the Lord
Chancellor had pronounced grace.
"Benedictus, Eenedictum."
The first toast was drunk after the
simple words 'The King." The second
pronounced by the Lord Chancellor,
was "The President, the Great Maeis
trate of a Great Nation."
Choate, rising, looked somewhat oale
after his recent illness. He was erect
ed with prolonged but dignified an
plause. He spoke at considerable
length, addressing the assembly as
"brothers all." He said in part:
RESPONSE OF EMBASSADOR.
"Words cannot express my gratitude
for this unique and overwhelming
honor. For an American lawyer to be
the guest of the bench and bar of
England on an occasion graced by the
applauding presence of so many of
their most distinguished members over
comes him with a sense of his own un
worthiness. I can only suppose that
in my person and over my head you in
tend an unexampled honor to the coun
try I represent. I thank you all from
the bottom of my heart. lam especial
ly grateful to my friend, the Lord
Chancellor."
Choate paid tributes to his personal
friends. Lord Chancellor Halsbury and
Lord Chief Justice Alverstone, and
said that the new diplomacy to which
the Lord Chancellor had said he be
longed had made his task here easy.
The men with whom he had to deal
at the Foreign Office, the late Lord
Salisbury and Lord Lansdowne, were
both of that school. He had always
found thorn anxious to maintain the
friendliest relations, always willing to
meet America half way and never with
a card up their sleeves. His task had
been easy because there were Queen
Victoria and King Edward on one
side and President McKlnley and Presi
dent Roosevelt on the other. The Eng
lish people and Americans were ever
determined to be friends.
TO RETURN NT^XT MONTH.
"The relations between bench and bar
of the United States and Great Brit
ain." Choate said, "are enduring. At
the beginning we borrowed everything
â your laws, your courts, your customs;
but gradually we are paying the debt
until we have almost reached a state
of mutual obligation and interdepend
ence. The ancient Inns Court and
Westminster Hall are regarded by my
countrymen, especially by my pro
fessional brethren, with Intense inter
est and satisfaction as the nurseries
and home of the common law which
underlies ajid sustains the principle of
liberty common to both of us."
Choate will have one more public
farewell, that at the hands of the Lord
Mayor on May 5. He expects to sail for
New York on May 23.

"Whereas, In the municipal campaign
of 1903, during the period Intervening
between the nominating convention of
the Republican party and election day.
certain members of this committee and
certain of the delegates who partici
pated in the Republican municipal
convention, bolted the party candidate
for Mayor and openly and notoriously
allied and associated themselves with
the cause of an opposition candidate
for the Mayoralty, and publicly fought
the Republican nominee, endeavoring
in every way to secure the defeat of
their own party candidate; now there
fore be it
"Resolved, That we, the members of
the Republican County Committee of
the city and county of San Francisco,
hereby denounce those who so traitor
ously and shamefully betrayed the
candidate of the Republican party for

"Resolved, That we stamp as un-
Republican the disloyal and treacher
ous action of those wh<r thus proved
recreant to the honor and trust re
posed in them as members of the Re

egates to the Republican county con
vention; and be it further
"tit solved. That we hereby pledge
each und every member of this com
mittee to t,-penly and publicly support
each and every candidate who will be
nominated on the Ktpublican ticket ai
the approaching municipal conven
tion."
RIFF'S SHOWING IS WKAK.
The foregoing was introduced to test
the sense of the committee and ascer
tain the strength of the Ruef following
in the organization. The friends of th"
resolution demanded a roll call, so that
every member of the county committee
should l>e placed on record.
M.Cerf was opposed to the last clause
of the resolution and would not ph-ciK* 1
himself to vote for every man nom
inated on the Republican ticket.
Secretary Atkinson declared that the
closing paragraph would have no force,
as the present committee would be dis
solved before the next election.
Cerf moved to strike out the last
clause
J. Henderson contended that Repub
licans should not hesitate to pledge al
legiance to party nominees.
Mr. Sonntag said he would not sur
render his privilege of voting against
an unworthy man on any ticket.
Cerfs amendment to strike out the
last clause was voted down.
The resolution was adopted by a vote
of 53 ayes and 8 noes. The members
voting in the negative were James M.
Kelly (Thirty-second), M. Cerf, Thom
as E. Atkinson. J. B. Whitney, E. S.
Strauss, Richard Regan, L. C. Cull and
Louis Strohl.
After a brief recess the chairman, on
motion of Henry Arh. was authorized
to fill vacancies caused hy death, resig
nation or otherwise. James M. Kelly
secured the adoption of an amendment
requiring the chairman to advise with
district committeemen on the filling of
vacancies.
On motion of Peter Kelley. the sec
retary was instructed to note changes
of reeidences of committee members.
Charles Sonptag read a resolution
conferring on district committeemen
the power to nominate delegates to the
convention to be voted for as regular
Republicans at the primary election.
Henry Ach raised the point of order
that the resolution was in direct con
travention of the election law.
The chair sustained the point of
order.
William Harrington of the Twenty
eighth District, who is not a member
of the committee, was permitted to
address the meeting for a few seconds,
but was suppressed when he begran to
tell how he was "Jobbed" out of ap
pointment as county committeeman-at
large from his district. The Harring
ton finger was pointing directly at his
suspected adversaries when Chairman
Riordan interposed to prevent per
sonalities.
The committee adjourned to meet at
the call of the chairman.
Among the well known Republicans
present at the meeting were: Post
master Arthur Fisk, John D. Daly. J.
D. Brown. J. Steppacher. J. S. Part
ridge, Senator R. J. Welch. ex-Senator
J. A. Hoey. Assemblyman George A.
McGowan, Frank Grimes, W. J. Young,
li. M. Frick, M. V. Taylor. D. R. Dun
bar, R. A. Hathorn, Henry Ach and
William Harrington.
The general trend of comment was
that the Ruef elements in the commit
tee would be powerless to prevent the
Republicans from putting forward a
ticket of exceptional merit. It was pre
dicted that the committee would lend
its aid to the powerful influences now
being invoked to secure cleaner and
better government for the city of San
Francisco.

AIR THEIR VIEWS
One Finds Defects in City Government While
the Other Defends Mayor Schmitz and
Attacks the Press.
A wordy battle over the manner in
which the present administration <->>n
ducts the affairs of the municipality
was fought last night in Scottish Hall
by Abe Ruef. political manager and at
torney, and J. E. White, attorney un
known and unheralded. The contest
was termed a debate, but as there were
no judges present to pass upon the mer
its of the speakers the public will have
to get along without the decision.
The debate was held under the
auspices of the Progressive Reform
Club and attracted a full house, num
bering possibly TOO men. The topic
was, "Resolved, that the present mu
nicipal administration does not deserve
Indorsement at the coming elections."
White took the affirmative, while Ruef
assumed the task of looking out for the
negative.
All classes and conditions of men
i were represented in the gathering, but
1 it was made up for the greater part of
. friends of the present administration,
I including members of the various mv
! nicipal commissions, office-holders, po
1 licemen and Ruef*s political lieuten
ants in various districts. This fact was
I made plain when Ruef made his ap
pearance. He won more applause than
; did White, though he did not quote
i quite so many facts. In fact. Ruef
j spent- most of his time in heaping abuse
j upon the heads of the editors and pro
j prietors of certain newspapers which
j have been particularly bitter in attacks
i upon the Schmitz administration.
LOUD CHEERS FOR RUEF.
The meeting was carded for 8 o'clock.
' but it was nearly 9 before a musical
j programme had been disposed of and
i Chairman John Hatch opened the
| meeting with a few brief remarks in
which he stated the nature of the de
bate Â«nd the question which the two
debaters were about to discuss. He
j requested those present to show their
i appreciation by applauding, but to
! keep quiet when anything that did not
j please them was said.
When Ruef made his appearance in
the hall he was loudly cheered. White
was seated on the stage long before
meeting time had rolled around, but
nobody cheered him. possibly becaii3e
they did not know him. The front
portion at the house was occupied by
friends of the administration, while
PRICK FIVE CENTS.
the opposition fai uon was forced to
seek in the gallery and on
rear benches.
White was the first to speak. H^
was introduced by Chairman Hati-h
and a weak chorus of che<Â»rs arose
from the rear of the house, while
those In the front seats remained quiet.
White's speech lasted about an hour,
while Ruef took up nearly twice that
amount of time in relating his trou
bles.
White did not waste mv h timÂ«*
with introductory remarks, but waded
In quickly and began to tell some Â»f
the facts about the present adminis
tration as he saw them. He assured
his listeners that he was not talking
from the standpoint of a prejudiced
man. but simply trying to cite some
incidents. In part he said:
NUMEROUS s(\\|,\|> VKIBS.
"Scandal has been rampant in
ly every commission under ihe present
administration. The only two to es
cape are the Park Commission ami
the School Department. - oth
ers have had their troubles
ways. This is certainly a reflection
on the man who appoints then* of
ficers. If he is unable to get good men
to do the will of the people, he falls
in one of the most essential points of
a ruler of a great city.
"Probably the most important

quarters familiar with the situation
among the peasants serious doubts are
expressed as to whether the rescript

OITBREAK FOR MAY DAY.
Revolutionists in Ru.-*ia Smuggle in
Arms and Bombs.
ST. PETERSBURG. April 14.â De
velopments all point to a crisis in the
present agitation among the workmen
of the cities and the peasants in the
country on Mayday, and appeals are
pouring in from all quarters of Russia
for military protection.
The Bt. Petersburg workmen are pre
paring a great demonstration. Arms
and bombs in large quantities have
been smuggled in and bloodshed on a
large scale is feared. Wealthy per
sons, who ordinarily go to villas on the
islands of the Neva or to neighboring
country places, this year are going
abroad. The Government has taken
few special measures to meet the situ
ation, evidently relying on the troops
and police to guard the capital. The
latter are extremely active. All the
prominent agitators are beine arrested
or have already been sent back to the
villages from which they originally
came. The prisons are filled to over
flowing.
There have been fresh disputes be
tween the workmen and the managers
of the Putlloff, Baltic and Nevskv
works and between the employes and
the management of the Government
< irtridge factory. At the latter place
the men refuse to continue to donate
any portion of thefr pay to assist in
the support of families of the soldiers
at the front, claiming that the money
is used to prosecute a war to which
they are opposed.
The news received from the interior
is alarming, especially from the Baltic
provinces, where the entire population
is- in a state of intense excitement.
The cities are being flooded with revo
lutionary proclamations calling on the
people to rise on Mayday. The crim
inal classes are taking advantage of
the situation to pillage and plunder,
while in the country the landlords are
powerless to cope with the peasants
and demand the placing of troops at
every station.
From T>unaburg, Government of
Vitebsk, come reports that the Jews
are in a state of panic over the cir
culation of proclamations similar to
those which prec*Hjed the outbreaks at
Kishineff and Gomel.
At Ekaterinnelav three revolutionists
who were surrounded by police fought
their way to liberty, killing or wound
ing several of the officers. A dispatch
from Kars pays that the employes of

the track has been damaged.

Costello Incident of Last
Voyage Responsible for
Much Discord Among the
Messmates of Big Vessel
Naval circles are daily expecting
open hostilities aboard the transport
Solace, now getting ready at Mare
; Island for a voyage to the Philippines.
I Trouble Is brewing among the officers
: of the vessel as a result of Lieutenant
Commander John J. Knapp'g action in
; ostracizing Mrs. Costello during the
; last voyage, from Manila because of
social discrimination. An effort is be
ing made, through influential persons
; at Washington, to have the lieutenant
i commander, who is the executive of
1 fleer, detached from the transport be
fore she departs for Manila. Lieuten
ant Commander Knapp ostracized
Mrs. Costello, a passenger, for no '.
i other reason than that she is the wife
' of a master mechanic in the employ ;
of the Government at Cavite.
A number of the officers of the trans- j
port personally went to Knapp during ;
the voyage and protested against the
discriminating order issued in Mrs. I
Costello's case and this is said to have
been the cause of the ill-feeling which
has since developed among the officers,
a few of whom have taken sides with
Knapp. The feeling against the execu
tive officer has spread into the fore- 1
: castle, and the reports say that the
men are becoming very sullen when
I orders are issued by the lieutenant
commander, who is now in command of
the vessel during a. leave being enjoyed
\ by Commander Bull.
Several days ago Dr. Cordeiro. sur- i
geon of the transport, who is said to
have been one of the officers who pro
tested against Knapp's treatment of
Mrs. Costello, on the ground that iso- I
lation was not only humiliating to the :
woman, but dangerous in view of the
fact that the location assigned to her!
aboard the vessel might at any time be j
washed by seas, was made to feel the
authority of Knapp through an order :
sending him to his cabin for ten days. j
This was followed by another order ,
prohibiting junior officers from enlov- '
ing wine with their mess and other an- j
noying instructions were issued to the
officers that are seldom heard of aboard
well disciplined vessels like the Solace, j
Mrs. Costello has already presented !
the facts in her case to the Washing- j
ton authorities, but fearing that they :
might not be acted on before the \
Solace leaves for Manila, a number of
the officers of the transport are en- i
deavoring to Impress on the officials
of the Navy Department the fact that ;
Knapp's unpopularity has reached a i
degree where it may provoke a scandal j

NEW TREATMENT
FOR MENINGITIS
Special Cable to The Call and New York Her

ald Publishing Company.
PARIS, April 14. â In view of the
epidemic of meningitis prevalent in
New York and which seems to threaten
Chicago, the attention of physician*
and the public Is called to the marvel
ous new method of treatment employed
at the Hospital Beaujon, in Paris, by
Dr. Albert Robin. Up to the present
time this treatment appears to have
given more satisfactory results than
any other remedy for this terrible
scourpre.
Dr. Robin uses injections of metallic
ferments, a "solution of one in ten
thousand." Every day twenty cubic
centimeters are injected into the mus
cular tissue nf the hip or abdomen. In
cases presenting very serious symp
toms. Dr. Robin obtained good results
from intravenous injections of a solu
tion containing one milligramme jf
metallic ferments, which seem to give
most successful results. This medica
tion in free from disadvantages. After a
few injections the record of the pa
tient's' temperature shows a general
lowering. Each injection is followed by
a rise in temperature, more or less
marked, followed in its turn by a de
crease, which brings the temperature
below the initial figure.
THE AMERICANA.
A New Departure In Reference Works
The Encyclopedia Americana proceeds
on a plan of Its own, whiqh it follows
not only in the realm of religion and sci
ence, but in every field of human activ
ity. Every subject is intrusted to a wri
ter who is prominently identified with
that subject. For example, Cardinal Gib
bons writes on the Roman Catholic
Church, and Samuel J. Niccolls, D. D.,
discusses the Presbyterian Church.
T;ike lay and business topics: Herbert j
1.,. Jiridgman writes on "Polar Research."'
Russell Sturgis on "American Architec- J
ture," Carroll D. Wright on "American I

Embassador Choate writes on the "Su

In this monumental production the
final results in every field of human en
ergy and endeavor are epitomized; the
vital requisites in every branch of learn
ing, past and present, are set down in or
derly and comprehensible array for
American men and women of affairs and
for the American worker in every profes
sion, occupation or employment. This i-e j
suit, now for the first time accomplished,
has only been achieved by first securing
the earnest co-operation and finally by
engaging the native services of more
than a thousand American scholars, edu- !
cators. experts and special writers. This
matchless phalanx of intellectual work
ers has been animated by a new spirit;
has struck out into new paths; has labor
ed along Â«#w lines with the steadfast
purpose of preparing a general reference
work from the American view point, thus
exemplifying American directness of
purpose and the American idea of doing
things by the short cut, an idea which
has helped to place our country in the
very front rank of civilization and pro
gress.

or the Board of Fire Commissioners to
stop the erection of that pitfall and
brothel at 620 Jackson street. This place
was erected as a deathtrap and for im
moral purposes, yet the Mayor and hi*
Commissioners allowed it to proceed
and since its erection have made no
attempt to close it, although it is a
disgrace to the city.
"I say that the administration is the
defender and not the prosecutor of
every form of vice. The administration
and the officers shall be known by the
company they keep. The pavement on
Market street below Stockton was a
menace to public safety for months,
yet the Board of Works and the Mayor
allowed it to be so and the former body
posted a placard there, placing the
blame on the Supervisors, a mean and
boyish trick, _
"The attorney for the Mayor and
the latter's secretary are deeply Inter
ested in certain cheap theaters and it
is a notorious fact that the Board of
Public Works and the administration
did all in their power to pro
tect these places and keep them
open, even though they were a
menace to public life and safety.
There is a man on the Fire Commis
sion who stole the property of the city,
! yet the Mayor never made any charges
against him and has allowed him to
I hold office just as though he had done
nothing wrongs
LAWS ARE NOT ENFORCED.
"Mayor Schmitz was either incom
petent or corrupt when he did not
stop gambling in Chinatown if he
knew it prevailed. The president of
the Police Commissioners said that of
the Chief of Police and the latter was
removed on those grounds. I say the
same of the Mayor. If he does not
enforce the laws he is not worthy of
our votes. He is a Mayor in name
only and the government is run by a
power behind."
A weak volley of applause arose
when White concluded, but when Ruef
was introduced the house fairly rang
with the shouts of the audience.
Ruef's speech while more brilliant and
witty than that of his opponent, did
not contain near as many facts nor
incidents, for the political leader was
bent. on getting back at the enemies
of the press rather than explaining
why the city government did not rem
edy several alleged evils. In part he
said:
"The administration is up against a
lot of reformers who would become
politicians and a lot of politicians who
would become reformers if they could
get into power. The Merchants' As
sociation was afraid to allow the
Mayor the privilege to appear befors
them and explain certain things. That
body showed its weakness, but refused
to allow Schmitz a chance to justify
himself before the people when he
asked for the opportunity some time
ago.
SAYS HE IS NOT BOSS.
"I am not a political boss, nor am I
the power behind, as my predecessor
inferred. I never got a cent from the
city nor from the Mayor and every
dollar I have made I have earned hon
estly at my profession. Ministers of
the gospel stand in their pulpits and
denounce the Mayor and administra
tion in flagrant terms, when every
word they utter is libelous and without
truth or foundation.
"1 will try to prove to you that the
present administration is the best one
San Francisco has ever known. First,
1 would like to say a few words in de
fense of myself. I have been pictured
smoking a big cigar, wearing loud jew
elry and surrounded by glasses and
wine bottles. I never smoked in *my
life, never was drunk and never wore
loud jewelry. I always go home at
night, though sometimes I admit it is
pretty late.
"Mayor Schmita prevented a great
car strike two years ago at the very
risk of his life, yet no one arises to
give him credit for this. Under his ad
ministration there are just one hun
dred less saloons in the city than under
the Phelan regime. The Mayor has put
the Thalia, Cafe Royal and other no
torious dives that flourished for years
out of business and has done away
with all private rooms in saloons.
"Schmitz did not remove Maestretti
for the fact that he believes in a man's
Innocence till he Is found guilty, and
when Maestretti's trial comes on he
will be acquitted. Great injustice has
been done the York Company by the
various papers, though that concern
did the work of the city well, but the
Supervisors turned the concern down
and gave the work to its friends who
do not do half as good work.
"I admit I appeared as attorney for
the French restaurants, but only be
cause they begged me to act for them,
as I had been their counsel for years
and also because a certain paper came
out and said I would be afraid to do so
because a corruption fund had been

one branch had no church there and
the other had."

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.. April
14. â Fully 10,000 people assembled at
the Santa Fe depot to-night to wel
come President Roosevelt. Grand Army
veterans were lined up on the plat
form and a band entertained the crowd
during the wait.
Promptly at 7:30 o'clock the Presi
dential special train pulled into the
depot. Wild cheering greeted the Pres
ident as he stepped out upon the plat
form of the car. He responded to cries
for a speech, saying in part:
"Let me say one word of special
greeting to the veterans of the Grand
Army. To you, my comrades, I wish
to say that I have just come up from
Texas and it would have done your
hearts good â you men who wore the
blue in the great warâ to see how, J
side by side, with your comrades who j
wore the blue stood the men who wore j
the, gray, united with them now forever j
and tver with one flag and one coun- i
try. Delighted, though I was with I
every feature of my reception in Texas, i
I think that the feature that pleased j
me most was that of which I have just |
spokenâ to see the ex-Union and ex- j
Confederate veterans standing togeth- j
er under the old >mg.
WANTS TO BE LET ALONE.
"Now I am going to make a request
of the people of Colorado. I am off on
a hunt. One thing you can't do on a
hunt, and that is to carry a brass band.
You cannot combine hunting bears
with a Fourth of July celebration.
Seriously, I am going to beg the people
of Colorado to treat me on this hunt
just as well as the people of Texas and
Oklahoma treated me on the wolf hunt.
If a lot of newspapermen start to come
in after me I will have to come home;
that is all there is to it. The thing
they can do that will please me best is
to let me be on that hunt alone and
pay no earthly attention to me or any j
of my party while I am off in the j
mountains.
"I want t< Â» ask the newspaper men,
and especially the newspaper men of
this great State of yours, for a fair
show and not to try to follow me up. ,
If they do it, it probably will mean
that I shall have to give up the hunt. :
If they won't do it, I will agree that if i
anything of any earthly Interest hap- {
pens I will have the news sent out."
At the conclusion of/the address the
President was taken in an automobile ,
to the home of P. B. Stewart. There !
he received a delegation from the j
Chamber of Commerce of Denver and ;
accepted an invitation to visit that !
city on returpyig, jfrom his hunt. An )
hour was spent In making preparations i
for his departure for Glenwood Springs
and then the President returned to his j
special train.
Promptly at 0:30 the train pulled out
of the station, the President standing j
bareheaded on the rear platform
waving his handkerchief to the crowd.
The train is due to arrive at New

TRINIDAD, Colo., April 14.â Seven I
thousand people, including two thou
sand school children waving small |
flags, graeted President Roosevelt here j
ihis afternoon with cheers. The depot I
platform had been roped off and fifty
special officers appointed to keep the
crowd in order. A number of rough i
riders and other veterans acted as a j
guard of honor for the President, who j
was introduced to the assemblage by
Mayor H. B. Brown as "the greatest j
man in the \yÂ»rld." President Roose
velt responded as follows:
"Not the greatest man in the world,
but I hold the greatest position in the:
world. My friends, people of Colo
rado, I cannot say what a pleasure it
is to be back with you again. You
know how proud I am of this State,
how 1 believe in this whole Western
country. And here 1 see men of mv old
regiment, men who were with me in
the days that will always remain most
vivid in my mind. I wish to thank the
men of the National Guard for turn
ing out as my escort. It is a pleasure
to see them and have them think of us
veterans of the late war. Let me say
how glad I am to see the school chil
dren's faces. I was going to say that
I believe more in the children than I
do in irrigation and you know I am all
right on irrigation.
"Just one word about irrigation. I
was immensely interested by the ereat
work that I passed just outside of the
city. There is no one thing possibly
excepting Panama that I feel is more
essential in connection with this ad
ministration than the part taken by
the National â¢ Government in helping
the irrigation movement in the West.
I believe in the century the great
development of this country is going
to come through irrigation. I think
our own people have but a faint idea
of the amount that can be done with it.
"I have come to the State of Colo

Just a few words of greeting to the

Here the train started. "Well, I can't
do it now. Good-by, good-by" (as the
train moved off).

cltifcens to the number of 5000 greeted
President Roosevelt upon his arrival at
the union depot here at 5:45 this aft
ernoon. When the special was first
sighted a mighty cheer went up and
this continued until President Roose
velt appeared on the rear platform and
began to address the crowd. His speech
was interrupted by the presentation of
a "big stick," the grift of the school
children of the city. The President
spoke briefly.

MORE TOUBLE
FOR EQUITABLE
. Suit Brought to Prevent the
..Carrying Out of Mutual
. ization Plan of Directors
INJUSTICE IS ALLEGED
Holders Accuse the Officers
of the Society and State
Insurance Superintendent
NEW YORK. April 14. â Complaint
â was made to Justice Blanchard in the
N>Â« Ycirk Supreme Court to-day that
the Equitable Life Assurance Society
has failed to distribute its surplus as
provided by its charter; that the sur
plus has been improperly used, and
that the mutualization of the company
tinder the plan adopted by the direc
tors will do an Injustice to the policy
holders.
The court was asked to issue an or
der restraining State Superintendent
of Insurance Hendricks from taking
further .proceedings toward the mu
tualization of the society. The action
wae taken by A. E. Woodruff of this
city D behalf of Herbert G. Tull of
Philadelphia and other policy holders
in the company.
In the complaint Woodruff says that
'â¢ mutualization plan means insur
ance at cost and that after deducting '
the expenses of conducting the busi
ness all the profits and assets of the
company belong to the insured. The
principle of mutual Insurance, upon
.which the defendant company had
been represented to be conducted, re
quired that policy holders have a re
turn of their overpayments in the sur- .
plus of the company, at such short in- j
tervals ac will incur forfeiture or con- '
; ftscation to the least number. The so- ,
ciety has failed to carry out the prin- ;
ciples upon which it was organized j
and the plaintiffs are of the opinion I
that the proposed amended charter j
will do an Injustice to the policy hold
ers."
It Is also alleged in thÂ« complaint
that by reason of the society's fail
ure to carry out the provisions of its
charter in respect to the distribution
of Its surplus a very large surplus has [
been accumulated. The complaint ;
farther avers that, because ot the
ability of the officers to manipulate
end use the same for their own per
sonal interests, an idea arose in the
minds of some of the stockholders i
that they had some right or owner- j
ship in the surplus, which was with
out foundation. By reason of this un- j
founded idea the company has per- !
mitted its surplus to be diverted from '
its . true intent and purpose and has I
permitted it to ' <=> used by some of its i
officers or by others in a way entirely
foreign to its proper employment.
Woodruff alleges that the nollcy !
holders endeavored to obtain a hear- i
ing: of their side of the case from the
State Superintendent of Insurance, |
but that he refused to grant their re-
Quest.
Justice Blanchard, being a policy
holder in the Equitable Society, de
clined to entertain the application of
Lawyer Woodruff and referred the
matter to Justice Scott, who issued an
order to Superintendent Hendricks to
show cause on April 18 why he should
not be enjoined from aiding in the i
mutualization of the Equitable Soci- ]
ety. â¢

WASHINGTON. April 14. â Over
the bitter protest of Miss Susan B.
Anthony, the National Council of
Women to-day adopted a resolution
pledging the organization to co-oper

"I do not consider divorce an evil
by any means." asserted Miss An
thony, who was on her feet before the
reading of the resolution had bepn

as Canada was once a refuge from
brutal masters. I will never vote for
a resolution that will cut women ofT
from refuge from designing and bru

ORIGINATES UNIQUE
LIBRARY THAT WILL
FACILITATE TRADE
COLONEL H. O. BHA.W, WHO WILL
GIVE TRADE INFORMATION TO
BUST MEN.
Colonel Henry G. Shaw, who was
long connected with the daily press
1n this city, has originated a trade li
brary which is calculated to give busi
ness men exact and handy information
on topics that most intimately concern
them. The field covered includes busi
ness lines and their allied professions,
such as civil, mining, mechanical and
electrical engineering. The library also
contains material from Government
and State publications that relate to
trade and industrial topics and from
the leading technical and professional
periodicals and the great trade direc
tories.
Colonel Shaw has classified the con
tents of trades and manufacturers' cat
alogues. Nearly all the leading houses
in every branch of Industry and trade
in this city are represented by their
advertising literature on file in the li
brary. The originator of this unique
scheme for facilitating trade is san
guine that it will assist In the promo
tion of commerce. The library has at
tracted attention abroad.
The Municipal Engineers of the city
of New York are assembling a library
that is to be complete and comprehen
sive within its own field of municipal
engineering. Max L. Blum, the chair
man on library, has invited Colonel
Bhaw to co-operate in the work of de
vising a special system of classifica
tion for the club. In China Colonel
Shaw's scheme of classification for
trade catalogues has excited interest,
the representative of the Peking syndi
cate railways at Chiao, Honan, hav
ing written to him for advice on the
subject.
Many trade orders received from the
Orient are accompanied by reference
only to numbers in catalogues with
which the Eastern manufacturers have
deluged the American consulates.
These catalogues are not always read
ily found in the possession of the com
mission merchants here. The particu
lar goods, machinery or wares are,
however, often kept in stock by local
jobbing houses and the catalogues on
file in the trade library will enable fill
ing the order in time for shipment by
the return steamer.

BOILERMAKERS
OUT ON STRIKE
Employes on the Santa Fe
Between Chicago and Al
buquerque Give Up Places
OPPOSE THE OPEN SHOP
Officials Deny That They
Are Discriminating: Either
For or Against the Unions
TOPEKA. Kans.. April 14â The boll
er-mukers on the Santa Fe system be
tween Chicago and Albuquerque, more
than 200 in all, went on strike this
morning. The strike was ordered by
the officers of the Brotherhood of Boil
er-makers at Kansas City.
One hundred boiler-makers walked
out here, but the Santa Fe officials in
sist there Is no strike at this point.
"Business is dull," said General Fore
man John Purcell, "and we have laid
off some men. That is all."
The men cay they have quit work be
cause of sympathy with the boiler
makers on the western division of the
road, admitting that they themselves
have no grievance. In reality the whole
affair is a struggle for the closed shop
principle. Tha Santa Fe has won lta
fight with the machinists, and is now
conducting its shops here on the open
shop plan. The boiler-makers allege
the road is employing non-union men
whenever possible and they fear that
if this continues their union will soon
be in the same position ac that of the
machinists.
Santa Fe officials deny that they are
discriminating in any way either for
or against tha union.
The boiler-makers held a meeting this
afternoon and another to-night. They
announce that they are in good shape
to strike and say the contest will be
vigorously pushed.
No expression can be secured from
Santa Fe officials as to whether they
will treat with the union, as General
Manager Mudge Is out of the city. Ne
gotiations on the part of the Santa Fe,
if there are any, will be in charge of
Third Vice President Ktndrick in
Chicago.
NO SIGNS OF PEACE.
Chicago Strikers and Employer* Un-
able to Reach an Agreement.
CHICAGO, April 14.â After a day and
a large part of the night spent in con
ferences with both sides In the Mont
gomery, Ward & Co. strike, Mayor
Dunne late to-night announced that he
had made no progress toward a settle
ment of the trouble and he did not seem
hopeful that an adjustment will come
in the near future. Further confer
ences will be held to-morrow, but it is
not thought to-night by either the em
ployers or the strikers that any ar
rangement will be reached. The great
obstacle to the settlement is that the
teamsters insist that the strike of the
garment workers, now four months old,
be arbitrated before the teamsters re
turn to work, and the employers insist
that the teamsters return to work be
fore anything Is done concerning the
garment workers.
Mayor Dunne endeavored to-night to
bring about a Joint conference, but
neither side would consent to meet the
other. The firm of Montgomery, Ward
A Co. succeeded in sending more goods
to the freight depots to-day than at
any time since the commencement of
the Btrike. All of the wagons were un
der police protection, and there was
less violence than on any of the pre
ceding days.
Mayor Dunne declined to-night to
discuss a charge brought to his atten
tion that a bribe had been offered for
the settlement of the strike.
A fight between union and non-union
men, which almost attained the magni
tude of a riot, took place to-night at
State and Van Buren streets, where a
crowd of union men attacked four non
union men who were leaving a restau
rant. The non-union men fought des
perately, but were overwhelmed by
numbers and were compelled to run.
All of them sustained scalp wounds,
and James F. Galley, one of the union
attacking party, was stabbed in the
arm. His Injuries are not serious.
James Mallery, a teamster, 31 years
old, who had delivered a load of mer
chandise to Montgomery, Ward & Co.,
was to-night dragged by several strik
ers into an alley at Jackson boulevard
and State street and beaten Into insen
sibility.

OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla., April 14.
Acting upon the general belief that

ritory to enter a vigorous protest
against being included in a bill where
New Mexico and Arizona are con

Five Injured and Fifty Have
Narrow Escape From a Big
Fire in New Y r ork City
SWEATSHOP DESTROYED
Flames Spread Rapidly and
Occupants of Building
Are All but Surrounded
NEW YORK, April 14.â Five persons
were badly hurt, fifty others narrowly
escaped aeath or injury and hundreds
were driven from adjoining tenement
houses in a fire early to-day that de
destroyed the seven-story sweatshop
building at 127-131 Hester street and
extended to and damaged several near
by buildings. The damage is estimated
at $100,000.
That there were no fatalities was due
to the fact that there were no children
and only one woman, the wife of the
janitor, in the place. About fifty men,
some employed as watchmen for the
various clothing factories, were in the
building.
As the fire started on the third floor
and spread so quickly that escape by
the stairs from the upper stories was
soon cut off, more than half of these
men had to Jump to the roofs of ad-
Joining buildings, some across the
chasm of an eight-foot alleyway, to
save their lives. All of the injured weTe
hurt in making the leap for life.
Before the fire was controlled It
spread to the two six-story tenements
adjoining and singed the fronts of four
big tenements and a public school
building on the south side of the street.

WILL DEVELOP
THE ORE LANDS
SDeolal Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
BOSTON, April 14. â A new corpora
tion is to be formed to take over the
last holdings of ore lands owned by
the Great Northern Railroad and de
velop them. This innovation in finance
is intended as a conversion of the fixed
assets Into dividends for the stock
holders. The Great Northern stock
holders will receive as a bonus for Jflv
ing up their equity in the lands, new
stock which will be worth $100 Der
share to them. On this basis it will
i be worth $29 a share to the holders of
Northern Securities and about fifteen
per cent to Union Pacific stockholders.
The Union Pacific will receive about
$22,900,000 of the Great Northern stock
and will therefore receive the same
amount of the new ore stock. The
1 Northern Securities stockholders will
j receive about $29 in Great Northern
i and on the basis above outlined will
receive the same amount in the new
ore stock.
The purchase of the lands will be
made from the # Great Northern direct
by the new company, the exchange of
rights being effected by giving the new
stock to the holders of record at the
time the deal is announced.

INVESTIGATING
ISLAND LABOR
United States Commissioner
Charles P. Neill of Well
ington En Route to Hawaii
PRESIDENT WANTS DATA
Official Is to Make Close
Study of Conditions That
Relate to the Brown Men
Charles P. Neill, United States La
bor Commissioner, arrived here vpsi
terday from Washington and is regis
tered at the St. Francis Hotel. The
Commissioner is on his way to the
Hawaiian Islands for the purpose of
gleaning knowledge of the labor situa
tion there and especially as to these
conditions bearing on the employment
of Japanese and Chinese. It is the
duty at the Commissioner to make a
tour of the United States every five
years for the purpose of making a re
port on labor conditions, but hereto
for the Hawaiian Islands have not re
ceived any great amount of attention
from this department of the Govern
ment.
Commissioner Nelll, however, has
decided to make his investigation of
the situation in the islands most thor
ough this year and with that idea in
view he recently dispatched one of his
assistants to Honolulu to gather data
in advance of his coming. Discuss
ing his proposed visit to the 1 islands,
Commissioner Neill said last night:
Whi!Â« I naturally have the greatest confi
dence In the work bÂ«lngr done In Honolulu by
my assistant, Mr. Clark, I feel that It would
not be quite right for mÂ« to base my future
report to the Prealdent on a reeport of another,
especially when It will concern conditions
2000 mile* away and of great importance to
the people of the United States. As a Gar
ernment official I do not deem it proper, at
this early date, to make any forecast as to
what action may be taken by Congress at Its
coming meeting, but I feel confident that there
will be much legislation regarding labor, and
I know that the President Is deeply Interested
In the question and will naturally want all
the information that may be obtained.
Commissioner Neill leaves for Hono
lulu on the steamship Manchuria, sail
ing on Wednesday next. On the same
steamer will be J. B. Castle, one of
the leading plantation owners of Ha
waii, who is well informed on the
labor situation in the islands, and will,
it is expected, furnish much Interest
ing information to the Commissioner
on the subject during the voyage to
the Island Territory.
TWO REGIMENTS OF INFANTRY
HAVE REUNION AT HONOLULU
Soldiers Going East and West Ex-
change Greetings In the
Islands.
Honolulu has been a big transport
center for the last few days and the
officers and troops on the different
vessels have been enjoying the hos
pitality of residents there. It has
been a general reunion of the Four
teenth and Nineteenth infantries. The
Sheridan arrived there on Wednesday
from Manila with the Fourteenth In
fantry on board, bound direct to Port
land, Or. The cause of her stay at
that port is the fact that she is un
loading 1095 tons of coal that she
brought from Nagasaki for that port.
The coal is to be stored there for use
of the transport service.
Major C. A. Devol expects the Sher
idan will sail from Honolulu to-day.
The transport Dix, loaded with horses
and mules, arrived at Honolulu on
Monday from this port and sailed for
Manila late Thursday night- All the
animals were given a run on shore.
The Buford, which arrived at Manila
early in the week from Portland. Or.,
sailed late Thursday night for Ma
nila. She has the Nineteenth Infan
try on board.
The transport Sherman is due to ar
rive here from Manila late to-day or
early to-morrow morning.
General Frederick Funston intends
to move to-flay out to his new quar
ters at Fort Winfleld Scott. He has
chosen a fine site Just beyond the
national cemetery, which gives him a
commanding view of the post and the
Alcatraz and Angel islands.
The officers stationed at Fort Miley
paid their respects to General Funs
ton yesterday. In the party were Cap
tain Charles H. Hunter and Lieuten
ants James L. Long, S. C. Cardwell
and Jesse G. Langdon. They were all
in full dress uniform.
The following officers registered at
department headquarters yesterday:
Captain Charles C. Walcutt Jr., quar
termaster from Prescott, Ariz., on
leave, staying at 2218 Dwight way;
Captain John D. Shea. Fourth Cav
alry, from the Presidio at Monterey,
at the Occidental Hotel.
SUES TO RESTRAIN UNIONS.â Henry
Kohler, proprietor of the "Koffee Kup Restau

Interfering with his business. He alleges that
because he refuses to accede to the demands
of the unions they have placed pickets in front
of hi 3 place of business to drive customers
away.

3000 little throats at the baton of the
leader.
You talk about Vlgna. Franko and
the other baton wielders over on Mis
sion street â what is their achievement
alongside the work of a little woman,
about five feet of herâ little Estelle
Carpenterâ who has trained these 6000
eyes and 3000 voices to follow how
and where she will; to take, to hold, to
drop, to swell, to softenâ just with
those little hands of hers, abetted by
her snapping black eyes and her mighty
magnetism.
What's it all abou*?
Why, yesterday and the day before,
the choruses that will sing with Innes*
Band at the great May day festivals
at the Mechanics' Pavilion, held their
dreÃS rehearsals â and you should have
been one of the half-hundred of the
audience. It didn't cost $10 for an or
chestra-seat and the thrill was thereâ
the thing you've been paying that ten
for over at the grand opera-
It was 10 o'clock yesterday when
trains of special cars deposited those
3000 lads and lassies at Eddy and
Jones streets, and they made things
lively for a time.
From 10:30 until 12 they sang and
sang, and they attended to the busi
ness in hand with a splendid enthusi
asm.
But the real treat came when the
folk songs were given, some of them In
four partsâ "Old Kentucky Home,"
"Suwanee River," "Maryland. My
Maryland," "Dixie," "Columbia" and
"The Blue Danube," and sung with a
marvelous understanding of the
themes. Here, fellow-citizens, ye who
love "tunes," here's where you'll hear
them as you have never heard them
before^ â at the May day festival at the
Pavilion â from the throats of these 3000
little children, think of that! And to
Miss Carpenter and her assistant, Mrs.
Peter McGlade. were the splendid re
sults of yesterday due.
During the rehearsal Mayor SchmitÂ»,
Alfred Roncovieri, president of the
board, and Mr. Pasmore (who wrote
the music to "Gloria, California") made
"speeches" predicting great things for
the future musical understanding of
Californians.
After hearing "America" as those
blessed children sang it yesterday, let
it not be said that patriotism is passe!
ELEGTRICAIi OPERATOR
TELLS STRANGE STORY
Charles H. Messner Says He Was Held
Up by Man While Working on
Pacific Street.
Charles H. Messner. an electrical
operator at the sub-station of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company,
734 Pacific street, yesterday told Po
liceman Joy of a strange experience
he had undergone on Thursday after
noon. He said he was working under
a piece of machinery at the sub-sta
tion shortly after 1 o'clock -when he
was accosted by a man who asked
him for the "boss." Messner replied
that the "boss" was not there.
The man used an offensive expres
sion and said: "Come out of there or
I'll choke daylight out of you. I want
money." Messner was scared and told
the man he had only 50 cents In his
pockets. "Hand it over." commanded
the stranger, and Messner promptly
complied. The man walked along Pa
cific street and turned south on Du
pont. Messner described him as about
35 years old. six feet three inches
tall, of dark complexion, smooth
shaven and having large brown eyes.
He wore a light gray sack suit. Mess
ner lives at 118 LJly avenue.

NEW YORK. April 14.â Bradstreefs ,
to-morrow will say:
Spring trade has apparently passed
its zenith, but re-orders, especially at i
the West, are unusually good, iron con- ;
sumption is unprecedented, winter i
wheat promises excellently and the '
acreage in other cereals will be larere. )
Building and building materials are
active; export trade displaying slsrns !
of improvement; railroad earnincs :
chow 10 per cent gain tor March and j
an increase of five per cent for the!
quarter, while bank clearings show con- |
tinued heavy increases on last- year. !
Retail trade is good in sections, but
at other points has been retarded by!
cold weather or heavy rains and the j
lateness of Easter. ;
Business failures in the United States I
for the week ending April 13 number j
196 against 170 last week: 198 in the like
week in 1904; 160 in 1903: 193 In 1902. i
and 212 in 1901. ;
In Canada failures for the week num
ber 25, as against 26 last week, and 20 !
in this week a year ago.
Wheat, including flour. - exports for
the week ending April 13. are 1.293.303
bushels, against 886.017 last week:
1.213,855 bushels this week last year:
2,977,777 in 1903, and 4.118,108 in 1902.
From July 1 to date the exports are

the outlook is decidedly encouraging, :

back of the ears and on the scalp,
and it resisted the treatment of sev-
eral doctors who tried unsuccessfully
for I year and a half to stop it. In
addition to physicians' treatment
everything said to be good for such
ailments was used. In fact, all the
knowledge of every one aware of the
eczema was exhausted. Doan's Oint-

comparatively short time the area of

by nd by they completely dried up."

MARS PIANISTS ART
BY RESTING FEET.
Irreverent Youth Brought to Check
While Removing Kinks From Nether
Limbs He Disturbs the Peace.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Joseph Simimllo. youthful, tall and
Elim, disturbed the peace of a North
End vaudeville theater by placing his
feet upon the orchestra rail and â¢â¢Josh
ing" the stage performers. His lower
extremities interfered with the arm ac
tion of the pianist to the extent of
preventing free elbow-play, thÂ»s im
pairing the accompaniment. Wrong
notes were sounded by the instrumen
talist while Miss Gladys Montrevor
was warbling. 'When Your Mother
Took My Name, Long. Long Ago," and
the effect of the popular music num
ber was thus transformed from the
sympathy-arousing to the smile-pro
voking. Expostulations from the
thumper of the ivories were received
with Hbald Jeers from Master Siminel
lo. and eventually Special Policeman
Thompson, aided by Regular Patrol
| man T. Kavanagh. removed the cre
ator of discord and booked him for
peace disturbance.
Master Slmlnello was palpably ig
norant of the seriousness of his posi
tion as he stood before Police Judge
Mogan and Jauntily pleaded not guilty.
In the first place, he alleged, the ex
tent of his footwork had been exag-
gerated by the prosecution. It was not
with intent to damage the instrumen
tation that he elevated his brogans,
but merely to stretch the kinks out
of his legs, which, as the court might
see for Itself, were of extraordinary
length. He had sat in cramped atti
tude until both of his nether limbs
were in the condition colloquially
termed "asleep," and before he rested
them upon the rail they felt as If
myriad needles were shooting through
them. If the pianist had been a mas
ter of his art or less spectacular in his
playing there would have been ample
elbow-room for him. As for "joshing"
the ptare artists, that accusation, too,
waÂ« recklessly enlarged by its authors.
The defendant's behavior during Miss
Montrevor's "turn" was more than
orderly â at least, would have been so
if his feet had been avoided by the
piano-fighter. If he neglected to ap
plaud the lady's effort his remissness
was entirely owing to the annoyance
conveyed to him by the rude joggling
of his feet. That he did not deliber
ately try to "queer the show" was
demonstrated by the enthusiastic man
ner in which he bestowed plaudits
upon the Dutch comedian who sung
"Meet Me in St. Louiey, Louiey." More
over, the only persons who seemed to
regard his presence as objectionable
were the piano-biffer and the special
cop.
The case was taken under advise
ment for one week. Master Siminello
being allowed to go at large on his own
recognizance.
A glimpse of stageland was also ob
> talned by Judge Cabaniss, before whom
j Cecil V. Hickling, manager of cheap
', vaudeville houses, and Mrs. Louisa
Bates, theatrical booking agent at 36
i Geary street, were principal perform
i ers in a drama of charge and counter
1 charge. Mr. Hickling stood accused
j of having stolen a gold watch, chain
I and locket from a Kearny-street busi
i ness man, and Mrs. Bates was alleged
!to have embezzled $450 from Mr Hick
l Ung.
Th? first act (time. August 80,
j 1904) found Mr. Hickling serving as
night clerk in the Inverness, a Mason
' street lodging-house, and the Kearny
street business man and Miss May
Green quarreling in an apartment of
said hostelry-. Mr. Hickling enter? as
!a ptace preserver, and business man
i exits, leaving behind his watch and
', appurtenances, valued at $300. Busi
i ness man returns and finds Mr. H'ck
ling and Miss Green engaged in alter
1 cation, and when business man de
mands restoration of his property he
is informed by Mr. Hickling that Miss
(Jreen must have tnk<Â»n it, while Miss
Green avers that Mr. Hickling could
produce it if he so desired. Arrest of
1 Miss Gr^en and Mr. Hickling. but they
are released soon after their names
have been entered on "small book" at
police station.
Act second finds Mr. Hickling man
aging a variety theater at Fresno, the
stellar attraction at which is Mr*.
Falley, married daughter of Mrs.
Bates. In a burst of confidence Mr.
Hickling tells Mrs. Falley that he it
was who got business man's watch
and trinkets and that he kept them In
a safe deposit vault until the police
quest subsided, when he took them
<.ut and had his initials substituted for
those of the business man on the
locket. Husband of Mrs. Falley ar
rives at Fresno and accuses Mr. Hick
ling of having alienated his wife's af
fections, and Mr. and Mrs. F. return
to San Francisco. Mr. Hickling then
has trouble with Mrs. Bates, charging
her with having embezaled funds
which he put into her booking enter
while she declares that all the
money she received from him was her
due for furnishing him with perform
ers for his theaters. Then the orig
inal owner of the watch is told by
Mrs. Falley all that Mr. Hickling told
her concerning it. Mr. Hickling is
then in Portland, and when he returns
the "tiff" with Mrs. Bates is renewed.
Kearny-street business man then has
warrant issued for Mr. Hickling's ar
rest on grand larceny charge, and De
tectives Conlon and McGowan find
Mr. Hickling and discover missing
watch on his person, he having pawn
ed the chain and locket in Portland.
Act three finds Mr. Hickling, in re
taliative mood, charging Mrs. Bates j
with felony embezzlement of $450,
which he swears he invested in her
business enterprise and which she al
leges he paid her as booking fees. Both
cases are scheduled for hearing next
Tuesday.

TITE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 15, 1905.
streets, turns out to be a Harvard
graduate who practiced civil engineer
ing until the poppy juice wrecked his
life. Judge Mogan sent him to under
go examination by the Insanity Com
missioners.
Frank Macfee is held in $50 bail to
appear in the Superior Court and show
cause why he should not marry 18
year-old Torel Thorsen of 41 Eleventh
street, who swears that he betrayed
her by promising to make her his wife.
The defense before Judge Mogan was
an effort to prove the girl of unchaste
character prior to the date of her al
leged betrayal.
Martin C. McDonnell, accused for the
second time of having soid pools as
well as dry goods in his store at 3242
Mission street, proved that the evidence
against him was no stronger than that
which failed to convict him the first
time, said evidence consisting of cer
tain horseracing literature found upon
a shelf by the raiding -olicemen. Judge
Mogan agreed with Mr. McDonnell and
dismissed the case.
Elmore Moore, a minor, was pro
nounced incorrigible by his father, who
resides at 629 Broderick street, and
Judge Mogan informed the youth that
If he does not go to sea within a week
he will be sent to a reformatory.
"What do you know," the intelligent
attorney inquired, "of this man's repu
tation for truth, honesty and vari
ety?"
The equally intelligent witness re
plied that in all three essentials to
goodness of character the man's fame
was most enviable.
Alfred Price and Moses Ulmer were
active figures on Pine and California
streets and in connecting alleys during
the days when mining stock specula
tion was rampant in San Francisco.
The subsidence of the great popular
craze left them among the stranded
and ever since then they have con
tinued to linger in the vicinity of
'change, living precariously and hop
ing for the renaissance that seems to
become more remote every day. They
are chockful of reminiscence and pos
sess a certain value as raconteurs,
rivalry in that respect probably being
the reason for their mutual antipathy.
Their joint debut in the Police Court
occurred about a year agro, vhen Vet
eran Ulmer was accused of having
battered Patriarch Price's head with a
walking: stick. The assault was pro
nounced justifiable by the magistrate,
who urged the old boys to shake hands
and decide to dwell in amity, as they
had not very long to remain on this
sphere, anyway; but the suggestion
found favor with neither of them.
With augmented hatred of each other
they returned to their wonted haunt
and last Thursday afternoon the in
evitable renewal of violent hostility
took place. While Mr. Ulmer was im
mersed in whist with some kindred
spirits Mr. Price battered him from
behind.
In the court of Judge Mogan sev
eral witnesses swore that Mr. Price
was of more quarrelsome nature than
Mr. Ulmer, the latter apparently be
ing content to confine his antagonism
to covert "knocking" of his foe,
whose enmity was openly demonstra
tive. His Honor took the case under
advisement till next Friday and again
advised the living relics of a day for
ever dead to get together in their anee
dotage and thus avert useless compe
tition.

Judge Cabaniss dismissed the charge
of mayhem against Eugene Landsburg
after he became convinced that the
gnawing of one of Charles Randall's
thumbs by Mr. Landsburg was pro
voked by a finger of the same hand
being utilized as a gouge to destroy
one of his eyes. Mr. Randall waxed
very indignant when the decision was
announced and the Judge told him
that he might appeal to the Grand
Jury, which Mr. Randall said he
would do.
The woman at the bottom of the
brutal encounter was Miss Nellie
James, in whose apartment on Kearny
street it occurred. Mr. Landsburg
was visiting her when Mr. Randall ar
rived, and, in jealous rage, started to
beat her. While protecting her Mr.
Landsburg discovered that Mr. Ran
dall was industriously endeavoring to
squeeze out one of his eyes and in
self-defense he clutched the thumb
between his teeth and chewed it so
vigorously as to render the amputation
of a portion of it subsequently neces
sary. The men are bartenders.

DISCOVER BODY
OF PAUL JONES
Men Employed by Embassa
dor Porter Find Remains of
Famous American Admiral
LOXG SEAECH IS ENDED
Medical Experts Say There
Is No Doubt as to Cor
rectness of Identification
PARIS, April 14.â The remarkable
search which Embassador Porter has
conducted for the body of Paul Jones
has been crowned with success by the
discovery of the body and its identifi
cation to-day by the highest French
medical experts as unquestionably that
of the famous American admiral, who
founded the American navy.
Embassador Porter cabled to Wash
ington to-night announcing the suc
cessful results of his long and dif
ficult search. The body is In a good
state of preservation, considering that
the interment took place more than
one hundred years ago.
The circumstances leading to the final
discovery of the body are particularly
Interesting. General Porter has con
ducted the search for the last five
years, and when Congress recently took
no action upon the President's recom
mendation for the expenses Incident to
the search, the Embassador continued
the extensive labors at his own ex
pense.
A large force of workmen has been
engaged night and day tunneling and
cross-tunneling the old St. Louis Cem
etery. This constituted a huge opera
tion, embracing nearly a block covered
with buildings and requiring a system
of subterranean mining.
IDENTIFICATION COMPLETE.
Hundreds of wooden caskets were
found, but not until Wednesday was
unearthed four leaden caskets which
gave promise of containing the body
of the admiral. Three of them bore
plates designating the names of the
deceased. The fourth showed superior
solidity of workmanship. No plate was
found on this casket, and it is sup
posed it was removed when another
coffin was superimposed on it. The
leaden coffin was opened in the pres
ence of General Porter, Colonel Bailey
Blanchard, second secretary of the
American Embassy, and Engineer
Weis, who has been directing the ex
cavation. The body was wrapped in a
sheet with a packing of straw and
hay. Those present were Immediately
struck by the resemblance of the head
to that on the medallions and bust of
the admiral.
As was anticipated, no uniform, deco
ration or sword were found, as all
such articles had been accounted for
after the burial.
The coffin was taken to the medical
school, where Drs. Captain and Papilau,
the distinguished professors of the
school of anthropology, recognized au
thorities on such investigations, were
charged with making a thorough ex
amination for the purpose of identifi
cation. To facilitate this the Em
bassador furnished them with the por
traits and medallions, two busts by
Houdon and authentic descriptions of
tire cfclor of the admiral's hair and
the height and measurements of his
body. After the nmst minute examina
tion the following facts were fully sub
stantiated: Length of body, five feet
seven inches, the admiral's height;
size and shape of head agree with sev
eral peculiarities identical with the
head of the admiral; hair, dark brown,
the same as the admiral's, in places
Rlightly gray, indicating a person of
his age, 45 years. The hair is long,
reaching below the shoulders, and is
combed bark and gathered in a clasp
at the back of the nerk. The face is
dean shaven, all corresponding exactly
with tho descriptions, portraits and
busts of the admiral. The linen is In
good condition. One article bears an
initial, either "J" or an inverted "P."
WASHINGTON NOTIFIED.
Finding that all the internal organs
were singularly well preserved, the
doctors made an autopsy, which showed
distinct proof of the disease from
which the admiral is known to have
died. The identification was pro
nounced complete in every particular.
Care has been taken to keep the body
in Its present state of preservation.
It will be placed in a handsome casket
and deposited in the receiving vault
of the American Church, on the Ave
nue de l'Alma, until the Embassador
can learn the opinion of the Govern
ment concerning the most appropriate
means of transporting it to the United
States and giving a fitting sepulcher
to the body of the illustrious sailor
whose place of burial had so long re
mained a mystery.
WASHINGTON. April 14.âEmbassa
dor Porter's dispatch announcing the
finding of the body of John Paul Jones
reached the State Department to-day.
It is probable that a recommendation
will be made to Congress at its next
session looking to Embassador Por
ter's reimbursement. The remains of
John Paul Jones are to be brought
here and interred in the National Ceme
tery at Arlington, and It is likely that
the transfer will be made the occasion
of an interesting demonstration. It is
probable that Secretary Morton will
send a battleship to France to bring
the body home.

DEEP LAID PLAN SEEK
Stockmen Declare Increase
Out of Proportion to the
Figure for Beef on Hoof
Ssecial Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, April 14. â The packing
plants to-day notified the retailers of
this locality that an advance In the
price of meats will take effect at once.
Beef ribs go from 9 to 12% cents;
steers from 7^ to B^, and beef loins
from 13 to 16. All meats advance In
about the same proportion, the increase
varying from a third to a fifth. The |
packers give as an explanation for the
sharp advance the scarcity of cattle.
The South Omaha market records
Bhow that shipments are fewer than â 
at a corresponding time last year. Up |
to the present there have been 38,366
fewer cattle this year than last, reck- j
oning from January 1. The commission
men and the heavy stock raisers thor- I
oughly acquainted with the situation |
are incensed at the action of the pack- *
ers. They declare that the increase in j
prices is a part of a carefully laid plan i
to bring about higher prices. They !
point out that two years ago the pack- '
ing companies combined to keep down
prices so that stockmen all over the i
Middle West engaged in "feeding" j
sustained heavy losses and this year j
either abstained from Investing in '
"feeders" or else began feeding only in ';
the spring for the late summer and ;
fall market. The stockmen declare the >
increase is out of all proportion to the
small increase in the price paid for
beef on the hoof.
BALTIMORE. Md., April 14.â Retail
meat dealers In this city have ad
vanced thÂ«Â» price of beef on most cuts
about 2 cents a pound, due to the con
tinued advance In the wholesale price.
On the best grades the outside figures
show a Jump of from 3 to B cents a

AUSTIN, Texas, April 14.â The legis
lative committee appointed to investi

report to-day and stated in substance |
that, while it had made much inquiry, j
there had not developed evidence of a

USE OF RIVERS
BRINGS PROTEST
WASHINGTON. April 14.â The Pres
ident has appointed a special commis
sion to deal with three important ques
tions which have arisen relative to the
diversion and interference .with the
course of international rivers. This
commission consists of Judge Penfleld,
solicitor for the State Department;
Special Assistant Attorney General M.
C. Burch and Professor F. H. Newell
of the Geological Survey. The com
mission has just had Its first meeting.
All the questions before the commis
sion have formed the subject of exten
sive correspondence between the State
Department and Mexico on the south
and the Dominion of Canada as rep
resented by Great Britain on the north.
On the south there is the long-stand
ing controversy growing out of the
damming of the Rio Grande and the
use of the waters of the upper river
for irrigation purposes in American
territory to the injury of the Mexican
farmers on the right bank of the river.
The Mexicans claim that the Rio
Grande is navigable and consequently
that this diversion of the water is in
violation of International law.
To the westward the commission is
to deal with the Colorado River, where
the upper waters In American terri
tory also are about to be diverted, to
the loss of the Mexican ranches in
Lower California.
On the north the Milk River projects
in Montana have alarmed the Canad
ians. Arising in the United States, this
river flows into Canada and back again
into Montana.
The commission will have to deal
with some entirely new questions ot
international law relative to riparian
rights.
As the result of the conference with
Secretary Taft It was decided that as
projects such as the international dam
across the Rio Grande River and the
reclamation dam on the Colorado
River had been authorized by Congress,
there was nothing to do but to pro
ceed with the work, leaving the broad
er question of international riparian
rights to be treated diplomatically.

TWO SMITHS IX COURT
Attempt Made to Have the
Conspiracy Action Dis
mivssed by New York Judge
NEW YORK, April 14.â The indict
ment charging Nan Randolph with
conspiracy with J. Morgan Smith and
Mrs. Smith wrongfully to obtain money
from Caesar Young was dismissed in
the Court of General Sessions to-day
at the request of Assistant District At
torney Rand. Counsel for the Smiths
demurred to the indictment against the
Smiths and declared that the facts al
leged against them did not constitute
a crime. The court reserved the de
cision. Counsel for the Smiths endeav
ored to secure the return of property
taken from the Smiths, but failed.
Miss Patterson, who is about to be
tried again for the murder of Caesar
Young, was brought Into court with
the Smiths. Rand told the court that
a mistake had been made in drawing
up the indictment against Miss Pat
terson and that it tended to prejudice
her position in the capital case. The
effect of the action will be to prevent
her counsel from seeing the Grand Jury
minutes, which might have aided in her
defense.
In support of his contention that the
facts charged against the Smiths did
not constitute conspiracy, their coun
sel read an intercepted letter from
Julia Smith to "Caesar" Young, In
which the writer stated that Miss Pat
terson was about to become a mother,
which is one of the allegations in the
charge of conspiracy to get money from
Young. He declared that false pre
tenses could not be considered extor
tion.
Smith and his wife, who were excused
from pleading, were remanded to the
Tombs.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 14.
It is known here that Stanford men
crept up the steep pathway in the dead
of night and covered the yellow em
blem of the Callfornians with flaming
cardinal bunting. Their work accom
plished, they crept quietly back again,
staying only long enough to see the
chagrin expressed on the faces of those
Berkeley students who come to attend
the 8 o'clock clashes.
To-morrow is the annual field day be
tween Stanford and California, and the
"C" had been given a fresh coat of yel
low paint in honor of the occasion.
There was no thought in the minds of
the energetic student painters that the
naughty Stanford boya might have a
color scheme of their own, so they left
the "C" unguarded. Their thoughtless
ness proved their undoing, for the Stan
ford men had seen their rivals busily
painting the great emblem. Their first
thought was to turn the "C" into an
' S," hut because of the closeness of the
points of the letter this was impossible.
So they contented themselves with cov
ering the "C in the colors of the car
dinal. To-night the "C" will be watched
by a hundred prominent fraternity
men, who have sworn that it will go
hard with any Stanford man who is
caught loitering around.

July T. th^ Congressional committee
from Washington. D. C. that is to
leave San Francisco on July 8 for the
Philippine Islands on a tour of in

ident and Mrs. Benjamin Ide Wheeler
of the University of California at
luncheon. The principal member* of
this committee are Secretary of War
William H. Taft, former Secretary of

Roosevelt.,
The committee will spend the ma

will be shown over the grounds of the
university and will be introduced to
the eminent men who will be giving
instruction in the summer school.
Secretary Taft and Mr. Root will
address a meeting which will be held
in the Greek amphitheater either in
the morning or in the afternoon and
it is probable that an extensive recep
tion programme will be got up by the
summer school students.
â¢It is mainly owing to President
Wheeler's friendship with President
Roosevelt that Berkeley is to have
the honor of entertaining the distin

already mentioned the committee will
be composed of some of the most
prominent men in Washington, as
well as a large number of Washington

young robbers of the "Raffles" type
have been sent to the reform school
from this place. They had gathered in
the loft of the opera-house and other
places large quantities of booty. In

blow up the building. The explosive,
it has been learned, was to be used to
blow up a Southern Pacific express car.
While perpetrating the robberies the
boys were apparently living decent
lives. In fact they appeared deeply
religious. Robert Durham joined the

LIVELY TRIP
ACROSS OCEAN
British Steamer Fired on
and Stopped by Japanese
Warships Several Times
OAKLAND, April 14.â The British
steamer Adato, Captain Brodle in com
mand, arrived at Long wharf to-day
after a lively voyage from Karatsu to
San Francisco, during which he was
stopped three times and fired on twice
by Japanese war vessels and the crew
was called upon to fight fire while at
midsea in the midst of a cyclone. The
fire was discovered in the cabin and
was soon extinguished. *
The Adato left Kobe on March 13.
bound for the Japanese port of Ka
ratsu to take on coal for her voyage
across the Pacific. On March 18. when
eight hours out from Karatsu on her
homeward trip she was stopped by a
Japanese torpedo-boat, examined and
allowed her to proceed. Next day while
steaming between the islands of Yezo
and Hondo a Japanese torpedo-boat
darted out suddenly from behind a
small island, firing two shots across
the Adato's bow as a signal to come
to. The Japs were satisfied after a
twenty minute conversation by mega
phone and once more the ship went on
her way only to be stopped in the
Tsugaru Straits on March 21 by a Jap
anese cruiser. Owing to a slight fog
Second Mate A. Ritchie, who was on
watch, misunderstood the signals and
two shots were fired by the Japanese
vpsspl as a command to stop. After an
examination of the ship's papers the
Adato was again allowed to proceed.
The Adato was simply carrying water
ballast and no cargo, but the fact that
she carried her coal on deck made the
Japanese suspicious and was the cause
of her several delays.

ty years of hard labor as a pros
pector gave Edward Chase $35,000 in
cash and six days proved sufficient for
Chase to spend the money. During
the six days he did not go near a gam
bling table. His wealth poured ln a
golden stream over the bars of Gold
field during the early part of last
week. The saloons did not take it fast
enough to please Chase, who on the
last of the six days threw his gold
away by the handful until the last coin
was gone. He started out Monday aft
ernoon and was broke last Saturday
night. On Monday last he borrowed
enough money to equip him for an
other prospecting tour and left for the
mountains.
Chase is a well-known prospector of
Nevada. For years he met failure
after failure, but recently he struck a
claim which netted him and his partner
$70,000 in cash. Chase immediately
tilled his pockets with gold and endeav
ored, with fair success, to keep every
drinking man of Goldfleld in a state of
intoxication for a week. The saloons
aided him by charging from $25 to $100
for each order of drinks. Chase de
clares he has knowledge of other ore
deposits which will bring him another
fortune.

CONTRA COSTA
WANTS RAILROAD
Prominent Residents of the
San Ramon Valley Plan to
Build a Line Themselves
BACKING i IS PROMISED
Will Run Over General Line
of Tunnel Road to Reach
Tidewater in Oakland
WALNUT CREEK. April 14.â ThÂ»
people of the San Ramon Valley arÂ« to
have an electric railroad to connect
themselves with Oakland. The first
Bteps were taken at a mass meeting
held this afternoon in the town hall
ln this place, when several prominent
gentlemen, most of whom have inter
ests in Oakland and San Francisco as
well as this section, promised their
financial support to an electric road to
be built by local capital.
The meeting was called by the Cen
tral Contra Costa Improvement Asso
ciation, and It developed into a rail
road boom before it had progressed
very far. J. G. Anderson of Danvrll<?,
the president of the association, was
in the chair and M. F. Lebaree was
secretary.
It was Frank Gavin, manager of the
big Bancroft ranch between Walnut
Creek and Concord, who brought up
the railroad question. Mr. Gavin made
an extended address, tn which he told
of the need of better communication
between that section and the bay
region, and he declared that the natur
al line and the most direct one was
from Walnut Creek over the general
line of the tunnel road and into Oak
land, with branching lines that would
separate at Walnut Creek, one going
north to Concord and the other south
to Danville or beyond. Mr. Gavin told
of the great amount of produce that
coul'l not now bÂ« handled at a profit
because of the expensive and unsat
isfactory methods of communication
with the produce consuming center
around the bay, the long wagon hauls
that are made wors* by bad roads, and
the high rates. Mr. Oavin had hia
points at his fingers' ends, for he had
something to say about the many spec
ulative franchises that had been asked
for over the roads of Contra Costa
County, and he declared that if any
thing was to be done it would have
to be started by the people of Contra
Cnsta County themselves, and hÂ»> de
clared his belief that enough money
could b^ subscribed to inaugurate the

Speeches were made by A. Brubeck,
E. S. Hutchinson and G. M. Westcott
of Concord, Charles Qoold, R. O. Bald
win and C. J. Wood of Danville, J. M.
Stov, W. B. Burpee. W. A. Rogers and
Arthur Williams of Walnut Creek and
A. Rudgear of San Francisco.
Financial- support has been offered
for the enterprise by A. Rudgear. who
owns a magnificent ranch near Walnut
Creek, J. M. Stow, Prank Gavin, Mrs.

Bt>Â«cl*l Dtumtch to ThÂ» C*ll.
REDWOOD CITY, April 14.â Mark<*i
interest is bÂ«lng displayed in the three
proposed railroad lines to connect San
Francisco with Santa Crua. Any of
the three roads will add materially t >
the growth and prosperity of San Ma
teo County ami necessarily to thÂ« well
being of the county seat.
The r shortest of the three roads f in
contemplation Is planned from Boulder
Creek to Palo Alto, making cennection
with the Southern Pacific at these
points. ' The route of the second of the
proposed roads Is from Boulder Creek
to Millbrae. reaching Pescadero Creek
by a ridge tunnel. The road will then
proceed along Fescadero Creek to Pes
cadero, and ' thence along the coast,
tapping San Gregorlo. Purisaima and
Half moon Pay. Such" a road will be
scenlcally one of the most beautiful In
California; and commercially Its worth
will be enormous. A ridge tunnel will
afford connection between Halfmoon
Bay Valley and the San Francisco Bay
side of San Mateo County. â  â¢â¢>
The route of the third roadâ the one
that recommends itself notwithstand
ing its expense, may run alone;
coast from Santa ('ruz to Halfmoon
Bay and thence through the rM Â«.
the bay shore, as in the second
poped route. This coast road is thÂ«
longest and must expensive in pros
pect, but it will be enormously profit
itablc after it is constructed.
The coast line will tap a largÂ« dis
trict rich in timber, dairy and farm
products, lime and bitumen. The towns
along the coast are growing rapldlv
and offer exceptional opportunitiÂ«a for
summer visitors. From many points of
view, therefore, the coast line suggvata
itself as one of the bÂ«st â if not the
best under discussion.

at 1301 J street, was shot through the
heart this afternonn in thff presence
of her husband, Frank A. Sayles. and
their 4-year-old son udward. The body
of Mrs. Sayles, when first viewed by

Steamer Brings News of Stabbing Affray ort Liner Costa Rica
The Pacific Mall Company's liner
Newport, Captain Russell, which ar
rived late Thursday night from Pan
ama and way ports, has been away
from here since December 17. During
her absence she has been engaged In
the lucrative and necessary but very
monotonous service known in the ver
nacular of the coast as 'â¢coffee tramp
ing." Running between the coffee ports
and Panama, she gathered large and
email consignments of the fragrant
bean and carried them to the isthmus.
Some of it was shipped across the neck
cf land and at Ancon transshipped to
New York. The balance was brought
here on the regular liners. During the
last two months of her life as a tramp
The Newport carried 65,000 bags of cof
fee.
Her tramping Is over for the present
and the Newport, which is really the
smartest vessel on the Panama line,
has been restored to a place on the reg
ular schedule.
The Newport was passed by the Fed
eral doctors early yesterday morning,
and from Quarantine she proceeded to
Lombard street wharf to land passen
gers and discharge freight. She brought
few passengers and a small cargo. She
had only eight passengers in the cabin,
and of the nineteen in the steerage
thirteen were Chinese. She brought
1106 tons of cargo, S3B tons of which
was from New York. In her treasure
room were twenty-one packages of pre
cious metal, worth altogether $21,990.
The Newport left one passenger be
hind at San Jose de Guatemala. As a
high official of the Central American
republic, M. Morales Saenz, once Gov
ernor of the province of Quezaitenango,
took the liberty of fixing hie own time
for coming on board. He vindicated
his reputation for Independence, but
lost the steamer and is coming here by
rail.
The Newport brings news of a bloody
battle between two waiters on the
steamer Costa Rica during that vessel's
run to the isthmus. One of the bel-
Ilgeregts was slashed across the stom
ach with a carving kn'.fe. and both
were badly marred when the ship's of
ficers stopped the duel. At Panama the
men were turned over to the canal zone
authorities. They both were found
â¢ruilty of assault with a deadly weapon
and each was fined 510. After paying
the fine they returned to the Costa Rica
and are coming home on the liner.
Following is a list of the Newport's
passengers:
A H G Cooper, Frank E. Prince, H. J.
Deacon Mlse Alice Millican. Miss Pleasant
Ada Anthony, MisÂ» Julia L4po,

HENRY ACH TAIiRS OUT
I?f COURT TO BYINGTON
Sharply Criticizes District Attorney's
Methods in the Joseph Smith
Murder Case.
The trial of Joseph Smith, the aged
contractor, charged with the murder
of Joseph E. McGowan at the terra
cotta works, 2969 Mission street, on
November 26, was enlivened yesterday
by stormy scenes between District At
torney Byington and Henry Ach of
counsel for the defendant.
The hostilities broke out while Po
liceman James A. Feeney was being
questioned by the District Attorney
just before the noon adjournment.
Ach repeatedly made objections and
finally exclaimed: "I object to the
District Attorney's leading the witness
and making him testify just as he
wants."
Byington's face flushed red as he
sprang to his feet and, facing Ach,
spoke slowly and deliberately: "Coun
sel states what he knows to be a de
liberate falsehood."
"I don't want to engage in a game
of fisticuffs with the District Attorney
in court," replied Ach, "but I say again
that his reputation is known to be as
I have said."
"If you say," retorted Byington hot
ly, "that my reputation is of that char
acter 1 say that you know your state
ment to be false." ,
"Every member of the bar who has
had occasion to oppose you at a trial
will bear me out in that statement,"
replied Ach.
Before Byington could reply the
Judge interfered and commanded the
angry lawyers to stop their personali
ties. They promptly obeyed.
During the afternoon, when Captain
Burnett was on the stand, Ach char
acterized the District Attorney as a
"bully" for â¢'sweating" an old man
like the defendant in the captain's of
fice. Byington declared th^t he would
resist any attack on his good name, no
matter who made it. The Judge again
restored order.
The witnesses examined yesterday
were Detective James W. Boyle, who
took down the defendant's statement
in Captain Burnett's office after his
arrest; Matthew McGowan, father,
and Matthew B. McGowan, brother of
the murdered youth, and Captain Bur
nett. Several hours were wasted in an
effort by defendant's counsel to ex
clude the testimony of Boyle and Bur
nett.

STATE BRIDGE
IS ADVOCATED
Committee of the Chamber
of Commerce Reports on
Spanning of Carquinez
HEUER IS NOTIFIED
Opposition Is Made to Any
Obstruction to Flow of
Currents of the Rivers
William H. Marston, C. S. Laumeis
ter, William R. Wheeler, Rufus P. Jen
nings and William Matson, as a com
mittee of the board of trustees of the
Chamber of Commerce, have submitted
a report to the effect that in their opin
ion no bridge should be constructed at
Carquinez straits that would in any
way obstruct navigation or the free
flow of fiood waters to the sea. The im
portance of a bridge is such, however,
that the committee recommends that
the State shall build the required struc
ture to accommodate all traffic, includ
ing steam and electric roads, vehicles,
pedestrians and livestock.
A copy of this report, which has been
approved by the trustees of the cham
ber, has been sent to Colonel W. H.
Heuer of the United States engineering
corps. Some time ago the presidents of
the several commercial bodies of this
city met with the trustees of the cham
ber and discussed the bridge project in
open session. At that meeting the com
mittee headed by Captain Marston was
appointed. The text of the report is as
follows:
Your committee, appointed to report upon
the proposed bridge across Carquinez Straits,
respectfully reports that as this waterway is
the only navigable stream connecting the
great interior valleys of California with San
Pablo and San Francisco bays, It is our opin
ion that no bridge cf any kind should be con
structed that would in any way impede or
obstruct navigation or the free flow of flood
waters to the sea.
The importance of a bridge, however, to the
commercial interests of the State should be
carefully considered, and in the estimation of
the comatlttee the project of a bridge that
would nd be detrimental to either navigation
or the free outflow of river waters should be
encouraged.
Therefore, your committee recommends that â 
proper steps be taken, to secure a suitable
bridge, to be constructed by the State, to ac
commodate all traffic, including steam and
electric roads, vehicles, pedestrians and live- i
stock.
It la further recommended that the Secre
tary of War be requested to instruct the Fed
eral commission provision for which was
made at the last Congress to investigate Cali
fornia rivers) to investigate and report upon
what class of bridge should he constructed.

DEMOCRACY TO DATE.
AGAIN the country is put to solving the puzzle of what the
Democratic party stands for. Jefferson's birthdaj- was made
the day of definitions by the party leaders. They met, fed
and talked in Chicago and New York. In Chicago the exponents
were Mayor Dunne. Colonel Bryan, George Fred Williams and Tom !
Johnson. Judge Dunne defined Democracy and the others indorsed
Colonel Bryan, by virtue of his ex-officio position as seer and
later, informed the audience that Jefferson foresaw this defini
d and indorsed it. This makes it interesting to see just what
Jefferson indorsed a century ahead of his time. Judge Dunne de- j
fined Democracy to be municipal ownership of public utilities, to <
be run as a part of public government. He said : "The blow struck j
Chicago will be followed by like blows throughout the cities of \
United States. It will also be followed, if the Democratic party
â ise and prudent and incorporates in its next platform a ring
declaration in favor of government ownership of interstate rail-
Ms, telegraphs and express transportation, by a decisive victory i
:avor of the common people of this country."
The speeches were well spiced with denunciation of everything
that is. and were covered with a meringue of rainbow prophecy of
the happiness to be, when the Government owns and operates every
tig of industrial importance. From Bryan down the line to the
radiant J. Ham Lewis, the speakers were "full of enthusiasm. They
were sure that it is only necessary to adopt their view of partisan
Democracy to besom the Republican party off the face of the earth.
vim and vigor that the same men put into the free silver
tc was carried over to government, as the owner and operator of
â¢ business enterprises in competition with its own citizens, or
â¢ heir exclusion entirely from most of the activities in which they
are at present engaged. There is something attractive in their very
husiasm for this scheme of government socialism, as there was
heir propagation of the free silver fad. They are sure now, as
â¢ were then, that theirs is the way and the only way to national
greatness and individual contentment.
The same evening that these apostles of Jefferson were fitting
principles to their theories in Chicago, another set *of apostles
in New York. The Eastern revelators were Judge Parker,
â¢ Xewlands, Mayor McClellan. Congressman Rainey of
E and Congressman YVillet of Alabama. One might have
t-cted the span of Democratic Mayors to pull together, but they
L Judge Parker defined Democracy according to the familiar
faire" principles of Jefferson's inaugural of 1801, and all
- c^d it. He declared the "let alone" policy of Jefferson '
â¢ <ient to cure all evils, "if supplemented by the rigid enforce
â¢ the criminal law, in both nation and State, leaving no room
intrusion of outgrown customs or new-fangled forms of j
and humbug."
The king asked St. Paul. "What is truth?" and the apostle to
tiles ?ave a definition that no other apostle denied. But
Bttc to the Democrats is asked what is truth, he calls
Stle's definition "hysteria and humbug."' And Apostle

rical commercial development that has made us foremost among
the nations? When did government anywhere effect such business
elopment. and when has it ever proved its capacity to do it
anywhere ?
The Dunne and Bryan idea that government must cease to
govern and go into trade has its lure and its seductive side and
be reckoned with. It is even more alluring than was free
c-r on the divine ratio of 16 to 1. Those who believe that it is
the business of government to govern and that it has no business
be in any other business may begin now to take counsel together
and prepare for another campaign of education more strenuous than
that of 1896.
PHILIPPINE CENSUS.
FILIPINOS have for the first time had their census taken in a
complete way. It is contained in four volumes just published
by the Census Bureau of the United States. This is the first
siep toward the establishment of the Philippine Legislature, which
the law directs shall convene two years after the publication of the
reports of the census.
The principal object of the census was stated in the act of Con
press to be to obtain statistics of population and a general knowledge
of social conditions as a basis for the formation of this Legislature.
â¢ne gleanings from it will be of much interest to those who have
not time to look over the whole work. The first volume is devoted
to the history and geography of the archipelago. It will be of
great historical value as covering the ground just up to the be
ginning of a new era in the islands, and which is no doubt the start
7 point of what will be their really important history. The cen
sus contains some items which will surprise (and many which will
please) Americans who are patriotically interested in these islanders
for whom we have become sponsors.
The population is 7,635,426, and of this number almost 7,000,000
are more or less civilized; indeed, the non-Christian peoples are
stated to be only 647,740. The Christians are practically all ad
herents of the Catholic church. The wild tribes are only about 9 per
cent of the population. The Moros are Mohammedans. The
Yisayans form nearly #ne-half of the civilized population ; next come
the Tagalos and third the Ilocanos. Almost all the inhabitants are
native born. Exclusive of the army there are only 8135 Americans.
Persons of mixed blood arc reported to be only two-tenths of 1 per
cent. The illiteracy is terrible; only one-fifth can both read and
write, and only 1.5 per cent have received a superior education. This
will rapidly be remedied, however, for now 37.5 per cent of the chil
dren of school age are attending school. The Pampangan is the
most literate tribe, nearly half of the males being able to read and
write.
Under the head of occupations of the people the item of female
industry is remarkable. Twice as many of the women, in propor
tion, are wage-earners as in the United States. Most of these are
classed as manufacturers, as they work at home during the intervals
of household duties, weaving hats, mats and cloths. Pauperism is
practically unknown in the Philippines, except in times of pestilence
or destruction of crops. Only one in 10,000 is a public charge, and
in the United States pauperism is twelve times that. The reports
are an exhibit of what American occupation has done for the advance
in prosperity, education and order. The information in them will
be of great value to those who wish to study the welfare and material
prosperity of the Filipinos.

DAME RUMOR STILL
BUSILY ENGAGING
MISS ROOSEVELT
This
Time
to an
Indiana
Senator,
Who, of
Course,
Promptly
Makes
Denial.
RUMOR a few days ago engaged
Miss Alice Roosevelt, the daugh
ter of the nation's chief executive,
this time to Senator Beverldge of In
diana. The big Indianan was much
amused when asked about the mat
ter and laughingly said:
"It is simply ridiculous; nothing at
all in it." Senator Beveridge's secre
tary says: "This is the third time the
rumor has been afloat."
A MILE A MINUTE
SALLY CHAMBERLIN
He made a dash for the station
platform.
â "" INHERE was not a better railroad
telegraph operator on the line
of the W. and W. Road than
1 Tim Mulligan, but for all that
he was out of a Job half the
time. Tim had begun his career in
("hit-ago as a messenger boy, and had
â worked up from one place to another
until he reached the top, but there had
been many intervals. The trouble with
him was that he was np hero worship
er. He refused to believe that master
mechanics, superintendents, general
managers and railroad presidents were
better than other men, and the em
ploye who holds to that belief cannot
hold his job at the same time.
Not that Tim went out of his way to
be impudent or lacking in respect, but
that he was no cringer or timeserver.
He respected a man as a man, and not
because he held position. Three timejÃ
in five years he was called upon to con
tribute to a fund to buy an official a
silver dinner set, and three times he
refused and was discharged. He did
not refuse because he disliked the man
who was to benefit by the gift, but
because he believed that the official
should be satisfied with his salary, the
same as he was.
In the course of ten years Tim was
discharged seven times and seven times
he was taken back after he had loafed
around for a couple of months. The
term for it in railroad parlance Is sus
pension without pay. In no instance
vas there cause enough to warrant
putting his name on the black list and
Tim had an affection for the W. and
W. Road and did not look for a posi
tion on any other. The seventh time
he was taken back he was sent down
the line to a wretched little station on
half salary. He had to be freight and
passenger agent and telegraph operator
at the same time. Tim did not object
to nis new place. He knew that with
in a few weeks he would be invited to
come up higher. There was much
chaffing on the part of other operators
along the line, but Tim took it good
naturedly and went on with his work.
He had been holding this position
almost two months when a crisis hap
pened. There was an accident four
miles up the road from his station and
an employ* was sent back to do tele
graphing. He found the office closed.
The hour for closing was 9 o'clock
and It was now midnight Perhaps
this part of it would have been ex
cused, but that night Tim happened to
be off to a dance with a crowd of
young people. There was no orders
forbidding him to go to a dance when
off duty, and he was not supposed
to know when accidents were going to
happen, but he was held to be crimin
ally guilty and told to prepare for de
capitation.
Two days later the superintendent
arrived on a special train. He .was
showing a committee of the Legisla
ture over the road. On the same train
was a telegraph operator who had
come down to take Tim's place. The
special had twenty minutes to wait
that the run east might be clear and
the superintendent personally saw to
the transfer of the station. Then he
told Tim that he should never click
an instrument on that line again. Tim
replied that it would be no loss to
him and a few hot words passed.
As it happened Tim had received
his pay the day before and waa free
to go where he would. What he did
was to cross the tracks and take a
seat on a pile of ties and wonder
whether he should turn navvy or
farmer. The superintendent's train
was to make a run of fifteen miles,
6idetrack for seven or eight minutes
and then have a clear run of sixty
miles. Tim couM hear the new man
clicking away after the train had
pulled out and he heard the word
come back that it had reached R
and taken the sidetrack. Three min
utes later he was on hla feet and all
attention.
Darkness had fallen, and far up tÂ£^
CORES DEFECTS
OF EYES WITHOUT
USE OF GLASSES
Famous
London
Surgeon,
Now
in New
Has a
Wonder-
Process.
DR. STEPHEN SMITH. 8. promi
nent London surireon, has come to
this country to tell the eye spe
cialists all about curing defects of the
eyes without the use of glasses. "The
process is so gentle and gradual," he
said in New York, "that not the least
pain occurs and there is never the
slightest injurious effect. Some arc
cured in a week."
track he could see a locomotive head
light. According to arrangements made
there should have been no following
train for half an hour. The headlight
was three miles away when sighted,
but Tim knew by the humming of the
rails that it was a locomotive only and
that it was running at top-notch. He
made a dash for the station platform,
hearing the call on the instrument as
he did so, but he had not entered the
open door when the engine whizzed by.
There was a flash, a roar, and it was
gone. He saw only one man, and that
man was flinging his arms about as if
shouting. As Tim turned to the new
operator he saw that his face was pale
and that he was in a collapse. His
hand was on the key, but he could not
work it.
"Out of this, you spalpeen!" shouted
Tim as the frenzied operator at Collins
kept calling. 'Out of this, and let me
see what's the matter on the rails!"
Thirty seconds later he knew. It was
a wild locomotive which had passed
him â one of the fastest engines on the
road and in charge of a crazy engineer.
"Wild locomotive â keep Supe's train
on switch," were the words sent along
to Grafton, and though steam raced
with them, electricity won the race.
The Grafton operator had only a min
ute to prepare, but that minute was
enough. He halted the switchman just
as he was about to open the main line,
and fifteen seconds later the runaway
came along. It .was a mile a minute
and better. The great engine rocked
like a ship in a seaway. She seemed to
gather herself and take mighty leaps.
It was like a blazing meteor flying
along the rails, and men were pale for
half an hour after she had disappeared.
Had she struck the special train of
three cars she would have plowed her
way through to the tender.
"Wild engine â throw her off," was
telegraphed down to Stanion, and at
Stanton the flyer left the main track
and went plowing along and burst
her boiler with a sound that was heard
for miles around. Buck at Collins,
while she was standing on the track
ready to be coupled to a coming ex
press train her engineer had got off a
sick bed and taken possession. He
had made a run of thirty-five miles,
but it was his last ride. They found
scraps of the engine, but not even
scraps of the man the day after the ac
cident. Tim was summoned to head
quarters.
"'Mr. Mulligan," said the superintend
ent, "I believe you were the agent
down at Davisburg?"
"Up to yesterdayâ yes," was the re
ply.
"And then you lost your place for
not attending to business?"
"For not being at the station at mid
night, when I was not supposed to be
there, sir."
"Urn! I believe we had a few words
when the transfer was made yester
day."
"We may have spoken about the
weather," smiled Tim.
"Urn! Well, let the weather alone
after this, Mr. Mulligan. It's a bad
habit to discuss the weather with your
superiors. I don't think the young man
I took down will do for the place."
"Am I to go back, sir?"
"No. They want you in Chicago, I
believe at your old salary, and I'll
send some one down to Davisburg who
knows a telegraph key from a crow
bar. That^s all, Mr. Mulliganâ good
morning."

FASHION'S MIRROR
The surplice idea prevails not only in waists, but in coats as well. In
its best form the bust fullness is arranged from bust to waistline in shir
rings, these giving a more graceful curve than if drawn into the girdle.
The illustration shows one of the new circular skirts in brown chiffon mo
hair, trimmed with straps of silk of the same shade. The surplice of the
coat is of the silk, heavily stitched and attached to the high feather
boned girdle, with gold and enamel buttons set in silk frills. These frill
trimmed buttons mark the crossings of the skirt straps.

WOULD SWELL
SALARY ROLL
The exclusive publication in The Call
that the Board of Works plans to in
Â« iva.-^ the salaries erf many subordi
nates in its various departments and
to create a vast number of new posi
tions if the funds required are allowed
by the Buard of Supervisors in the
budget caused considerable comment
among city officials yesterday. The
proposed increases aggregate a sum
approximating $9280 yearly. The bene
fit would go to certain employes in the
Bureau of Streets. City Architect's of
fice. City Engineers office and in the
Janitor Department.
New positions that it is planned to
create will eat up an additional sum of
about $44,000 yearly. Most of this
amount represents the salaries for ad
ditional help in the offices of the City
Engineer and the City Architect, re
quired, it is said, in preliminary work
for the bonded improvements. The ad
ditional berths desired are for five sur
veyors, $8400; one field assistant, $1200:
two assistant engineers, $:56OO; six
draughtsmen, $9300; one clerk, $1200.
In the Bureau of Streets four addi
tional inspecto-rs of complaints and
ration trenches are sought at
$6000 yearly; one extra clerk in the
cashless office at $1200. In the Build
ing Bureau the Superintendent of
Buildings will absorb $2400 yearly,
vrhik the Chief Building Inspector will
be paid $2400 if funds are forthcoming.
Other extra positions to be created are:
one chief draughtsman, $2100; one ex
aminer of plans, $1500; one structural
engineer, $1SUO; two building inspectors,
$2700; one assistant clerk and stenog
rapher, $1200.
It i 6 not at al! likely that the Su
pervisors' Finance Committee in its
present trame of mind so far as the
Board of Works is concerned will al
low the increases asked for, at least
in many instances. Although the mem
bers of the committee would not out
line their intentions in the matter it
will be remembered that last year it is
sued an ultimatum that few salaries
would be raised and the committee cer
tainly will not favor any wholesale in
creases. Of the new positions that
would be created only those absolutely
necessary will be allowed. The request
for extra help in the Engineer's office
cannot very well be ignored, as it is
warranted by the vast amount of ad
ditional work entailed by the bonded
improvements which will be carried
<ut in the next year. This will also
hold good in the request for extra help
in the Architect's office.
Some clerical errors were found in
the budget estimate of the Board of
Works showing that the total amount
asked for is $2,175,515 50.
Through an oversight a request was
made for $348,157 to light the streets
and public buildings, the figures of last
year having been used. The sum should
read $28,000 less, or about $320,000.

CLUNIE TRUST
PUZZLES COURT
Judge Coffey Heafc Many
Arguments as to the Law
Governing Men's Wills
SIMILAE TO FAIE CASE
Tribunal Sees Intricate
Questions and Will Let
Attorneys Speak Freely
Judge Coffey was occupied all yes
terday afterneon in hearing arguments
as to thâ¬ validity of the trust under the
will of Thomas J. Clunie declared in
favor of his adopted son, "Jack Clunie,"
as to the property in this city known
as the Clunie building, said to be worth
over $500,000.
E. A. Bridgeford and Burrell Q. White
applied to the court for a distribution
to them of the property, alleging that
their co-trustee under the will, Andrew
J. Clunie. brother of the decedent, re
fused to join with them in their appli
cation to the court.
It appeared that Andrew's refusal
was based upon the fact that he was
advised that the trust was against the
laws of this State and that therefore it
was his duty to submit the matter to
the judgment of the court, as no citizen
could ask a court to distribute property
upon a trust which the law prohibited,
and that our Supreme Court had held
in the famous Walkerley case that no
court could recognize as valid a trust
which the laws declared to be void and
against public policy. Upon this ground
of Clunie's refusal to join with Bridge
ford and White an interesting point of
law was presented at the beginning of
the proceedings, namely, whether or not
it was the duty of the petitioning trus
tees to first show that the trust was
valid, or the duty of Andrew J. Clunie
to prove that it was void under our
law.
Timothy J. Lyons, on behalf of him
! self and his colleagues. ex-Governor
Budd and Judge Garoutte, attorneys
| for Clunie, argued that Bridgeford and
White could not be heard until they of
fered reasons to the court in favor of
the validity of the trust, to which Hud
son Grant and D. M. Delmas answered
that the burden was on Clunie to show
that the trust was bad in law.
Judge Coffey ruled that as this point
of procedure had never been decided by
the higher court and was not free from
doubt he would allow Bridgefnrd and
White to present their case and leave
! any law questions as to the trust to be
raised after the evidence was In.
, Bridgeford and White then presented
: their evidence, during the course of
â¢ which Attorney Lyons interrupted with
: severe comments upon the attitude of
, Bridgeford and W T hite.
When Bridgt ford and White conclud
ed their case Andred Clunie's attorneys
moved to dismiss the matter, upon the
ground that the trust claimed under
the will was void and against public
policy.
Lyons opened the argument for An
â  drew, and was replied to by Grant and
| D. M. Delmas.
Upon the conclusion of D.elmas' ar
gument the matter was continued to
Tuesday, the 25th. when Budd. Garoutte
and Lyons will present a reply argu
ment to Grant and Delmas.
If the trust should be declared void
the property will go at once to the
adopted son and the brother Andrew,
which Is claimed by Andrew's attor
neys to be a better disposition of the
title than that of being tied up by a
trust with the dangers involved in the
unlimited powers claimed by the trus
tets. The dangers involved in the trust
an said to be the same as those which
moved the Supreme Court to strike
down the trust in the famous case of
the will of James G. Fair.

them a check for $500 and that was
the last he heard of the "good thing."
Detective Coleman was detailed on
the case.
Hauser was brought from Paraiso
Springs on Thursday night on a war
rant charging him with obtaining
money by false pretenses. He is ac
cused by T. P. Finch, proprietor of a

tricking - -im out of $1500 by repre
senting to him that he and a compan

SEAWELL HOLDS
WITH THEATERS
Decides Police Have No Right
to Close Places That Vio
late the Fire Ordinance
GIVES PROPER RE3IEDY
Says Law Provides for Pun
ishment of Transgressors
in the Criminal Courts
The criminal court, Judge Seawell
holds in a decision handed down yes
terday, is the temple of law wherein
owners and managers of theaters may
be dealt with for violations of the fire
ordinance. The right does not vest In
the police, says the court, to close any
place of amusement, no matter how
flagrantly it may transgress the regu
lations of the local legislative bodies,
the sole remedy resting in the proper
and continued punishmenf of those who
persist in these illegal acts.
The opinion of the court was reached
in the suit instituted by the Baldwin
Theater Company to restrain the police
and Board of Works from closing the
doors of the plaintiff company's vaude
ville house on Market street. Judge
Seawell granted the injunction as
prayed, but not until after he had
pointed out to the defendants a rem
edy they could pursue if it is their opin
ion that the theater is unsafe and a
menace to life.
The testimony taken in this case.
Judge Sea well held, shows that prior to
opening the theater the plaintiff cor
poration sunbmitted to the Board of
Works its plans and specifications for
the construction of the theater and they
were accepted. The theater was con
structed in accordance with these
plans and specifications, and subse
quently, on November 26, 1904, a license
was issued to the company upon pay
ment by it of $201 to carry on its" busi
ness. By virtue of this license the
company conducted a vaudeville show
until January 16 last, when the Board
of Works notified the police to close the
place, and the police did close the the
ater. It was the contention of the
Board of Works that the theater was
being conducted in violation of or
dinance 88 of the Board of Supervisors.
In its complaint for an injunction
the Baldwin Theater Company recited
the facts regarding the construction of
the theater and the procuring of a li
cense to conduct a show therein, and
pointed to the fact that it had spent
large sums of money in constructing
the theater, is under contract for the
salaries of actors and others and is
liable for the rent of the premises
whether conducting its performances
or not.
It is the opinion of the court that
there is nothing in the" ordinance in
question giving the Board of Works
any power outside of the right to issue
permits after it has determined that
the provisions of the ordinance are to
be obeyed. This done, its power ends.
There is no allegation in defendants'
answer that the theater is unsafe and
there is no allegation that it is a
nuisance.
Hence, even if the defendant cor
poration had not paid a license, the
court holds that the police have no
power to close the theater conducted by
it. The ordinance provides that for
violations thereof a person convicted
of such offense shall be liable to a tine
of $500 or imprisonment for six months,
or both. A person violating the or
dinance would be liable civilly for the
sum of the license and liable criminal
ly for the offense, but this does not give
the polite power to close the theater.
They are entitled only to the remedies
prescribed by the ordinance for its vio
lation.
"The claim has been made by the
plaintiff herein that the ordinance is
oppressive; but for the purpose of this
action I will assume that it is valid,"
says the court in conclusion. "How
ever, an injunction will issue restrain
ing the police and the Board of Works
from closing the premises conducted
as a theater by the plaintiff."
Rain's Trial Is Set.
The trial of Pietro Raia, charged
with perjury, was set by Judge Dunne

Brogardo by Ancio Brissile. Raia and
Salvatore Alopia were witnesses at the
Coroner's inquest on Brogardo's body

perjury.

O'CONOR'S SUIT
IS QUESTIONED
Judge Hebbard Intimates
That He Will Decide in Fa
vor of Library Trustees
ACTION'S OBJECT VEILED
Court Wants to Know if
Sole Purpose Is Not to Oust
Incumbents From Office
Inevitable disaster awaits Martin
O'Conor and Thomas P. Dowd and the
unknowns behind them in their suit to
oust the board of trustees of the Free
Public Library. The case came up be
fore Judge Hebbard yesterday, and the
remarks of the court presage swift and
decisive defeat for its promoters. While
O'Conor and O'Dowd deny they have
any interest in the matter save to se
cure the retirement of what they al
lege they believe to be an illegal body,
It is the general opinion that they filed
the action to prevent if possible the
purchase of the Van Ness avenue lot
the trustees have recommended as a
site for the new Public Library.
When the case was called yesterday
Assistant City and County Attorney
Brobeck said that while he was confi
dent, in the first place, that there was
no merit in the claims of the plaintiffs
that the board of trustees is an illegal
body, he was positive that the method
of precedure they had adopted is not
proper. Quo warranto proceedings, he
said, constituted the only method the
court could consider, "and," he con
cluded, "even should the plaintiffs here
bring such proceedings we are ready to
meet them."
A nod from Judge Hebbard signified
his concurrence, but the court desired
to do a little questioning before pro
ceeding further. Addressing O'Conor,
who appeared as counsel for himself
and associate plaintiff, he said:
"What is the purpose of this suit â
what evil does it aim to remedy?"
O'Conor said that he had but one ob
ject in view, and that was to secure a
legal board. As a good citizen he did
not desire to see any man hold office
contrary to the provisions of the or
ganic law of the city.
"Come, now," said the court, "is not
the only object of this suit to oust the
board from office? Is there any higher
principle Involved?"
O'Conor smiled and began searching
through some law books on the desk.
He had no answer to make.
Brobeck said he was ready to argue
the case if the court desired to hear
any authorities. Judge Hebbard said
he did not care to give much time to
the case.
O'Conor, becoming alarmed lest the
court throw the proceeding out without
even dignifying it with a hearing, asked
the privilege of filing a brief in support
of his petition.
"Oh, very well. You may file one if
you desire," said Judge Hebbard.
"If your Honor should reach a con
clusion different from that it is appar
ent you now entertain," said Brobeck,
"will you please inform me? Ido not
care to go to the trouble of preparing
a reply brief unless it is necessary."
"I will Inform you," said the court,
but the general opinion is that Brobeck
will be saved the trouble of answering
0'Conor"8 written argument. A final
order in the case is expected next Fri
day.

the Alameda, Pacific, Santa Cruz and
San Francisco County clubs. The
matches will take place as during sev
eral seasons past, on the ground at

Will Measure Their Skill With That
of Coast Men in Sep
tember.
The men of the trapshooting bri
gade are looking forward eagerly to
the visit of the Eastern experts to this
coast in September. Crosby and Gil
bert, considered the best two shots in
America, will head the invading party.
With them will be Jack Fanning, Mar
shall, Heikee and Skelly, all clever
men at the traps.
The coast men will line up a strong
squad, made up of such men as Otto
Foudner, Clarence Nauman, A. J.
Webb, Edgar Forster and others.
The old-time shoot of the Lincoln
Gun Club, to be held on the 23d inst.
at Ingleside, is creating an unusual
amount of interest among the new
shooters. Many of them have not
competed under the old system of one
man up, grin to be held under the
elbow. The new automatic black
bird trap will be used and will give
a flight never used here. The club
has secured a number of valuable
s for the ladies, to be shot for
by their escorts.
On May 28, 29 and 30 all the crack
shots of the coast will meet at Ingle
f-ide under the auspices of the Pacific
Coast Trapshooting Association. Mon
day, the 29th. will be devoted to a
merchandise shoot.
The members of the Union Gun Club
will shoot bluerocks to-morrow on the
Ingleside ground.
The bluerock traps and those for
live birds are to be consolidated at
Ingleside. This is Intended to increase
the safety of the golfers on the new
links.
Will Improve San Jose Track.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRI.L 15, 1905.
UNIVERSITY MEN
ON THE COURTS
Tennis Representatives of
Berkeley and of Stan
ford to Compete To-Day
The fourteenth annual intercollegiate
tennis meet will be held this morning
at Berkeley. For many years the Cali
fornia Club courts have been the bat
tle-ground, but the courts recently laid
out at Berkeley make it possible to hold
the matches there.
In the last four years California has
been victorious and her rival has not
scored a single point. Beginning with
1901 California has won each year by
a score of 3-0. California's sweeping
victory during this period was larger
due to Coast Champion J. D. MacGa
vin. Even without MacGavin the
chances for a blue and gold victory
look much brighter than for a cardinal
victory.
Stanford practically concedes one
singles match to Berkeley. This is the
match between the No. 2 men, R. Mc-
Swain (Stanford) and Neil Baker (Cali
fornia). Man'- of the Stanford enthusi
asts figure that George Hodge, their
No. 1 player, made a showing against
MacGavin last year which warrants
his beating Claude Wayne, California's
No. 1 man. These two clever young
players are evei.ly matched and It
would be a difficult matter to pick the
winner. On recent form Wayne looks
a trifle stronger than Hodge.
A victory for Hodge would make the
outcome of the meet hinge on the dou
bles. This also should prove a close
and an exciting match. Stanford will
be represented by John Caseell and
Hodge, while the California representa
tives will be Robert Variel and Wayne.
The latter are both from Southern Cal
ifornia and have been playing together
for several years. Cassell was former
ly champion of Lowell High School and
is a promising young player at the
California Club. Cassell and Wayne
are both steady playerte, while Hodge
and Variel belong to the erratic class.
Both of the latter are capable of play
inp brilliant tennis at times.
The second singles match will be be
t\vÂ»-f?n a veteran and a novice. Neil
Baker played in the California team
last year and is as steady as a clock.
He has had considerable experience.
On the other hand McSwain, the cardi
nal representative, is a new man who
has had little or no experience. He is
a clever young player, but is hardly
conceded a chance to beat Baker.
Conceding this match to California
and an even chance to Stanford in the
other two contests another California
victory is anticipated. The blue and
gold followers expect to win all three
points and thus establish a record that
would stand for many years. Stanford
undoubtedly has a fighting chance and
her representatives will make a desper
ate effort to win the meet.
The finals of the handicap doubles
tournament commenced on the Golden
Gate Park courts two weeks ago will
be played to-morrow afternoon. The
Baker brothers (owe 15 3-6) will meet
Fred Adams and Guy Lytton (scratch).
The match will* be unusually interest
ing, as a victory for the Baker broth
ers would give them permanent posses
sion of the cups which have been up
for more than three years.
A class singles -tournament will be
played on the California Club courts
to-mc/rrow. The players will meet un
der the new classification for cups re
cently offered by the directors
Two tournaments will be played by
the members of the Ladies' Annex next
week. A handicap singles tournament
for the Miller cup is scheduled for
Tuesday. MiÃs Cully and Miss Hess
have each won the trophy twice and
it is expected one or the other will get
the third and flnal victory on Tues
day. On Wednesday a handicap dou
bles tournament for thÂ» Olds cup will
be held.

soned Oarsmen.
BERKELEY, April 14. â The boat
race between the University of Wash
ington and the University of Califor
nia crews will be held to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock on the Oakland
estuary. The California crew be
lieves it has a genuinely hard propo
sition on its hands to defeat the
northerners. If the brawny Washing
tonians are beaten Coach Garnett and
his young men will be entitled to a
great deal of praise. It is the first
time in the history of the sport that
a regular coach has had charge of
rowing affairs here and the result of
his work will be watched with deep
interest by ail who hope rowing will
take a prominent place among col
lege athletics. Garnett's men are all
in fine condition, have practiced faith
fully and will give a good account of
themselves, win or lose.
The confidence that comes from a
long line of victories buoys up the
track team of the University of Cali
fornia on the eve of the annual strug
gle with Stanford for track and field
honors. *Nine times has the blue and
gold waved over the cardinal on field
days to twice for Stanford's, hence
the well founded belief in victory to
morrow. The experts who prepare
"dope" on such affairs announce that
on paper it is about an even thing,
with California having Just a shade
the best prospect because Its athletes
were selected from a larger and so
perhaps slightly superior field.
Ollie Snedigar, sprinter and foot
ball hero, will carry the hopes of the
blue and gold in the 100-yard dash
and the 220-yard run. Snedigar is
fast and should be first in both these
events.
Wilcox will be relied upon to beat
Miller, Russell and Davis of Stanford.
Miller is likely to be the stumbling
block here to California's hopes. He
is the freshman who captured the
quarter at Pomona after winning the
mile and the 880-yard dash. Ed
wards and Yost of California will go
against Miller in the 880-yard dash
and if they beat the cardinal they will
know a rate has been in progress.
Captain Hackley should score against
Stanford in the two-mile event, and
Snedigar and Neighbors are expected
to duplicate the trick in the broad
jump. Hickoy will have to beat Cap
tain Bell of Stanford in the high jump.
Stanford is supposed to have the
best of it in the hurdles and the pole
vault. Gilmore is California's reli
ance in the shot-put, his record of
more than 42 feet being a reassuring
circumstance to hopeful California
men. Sperry, too, is expected to make
good in this event. The latter has the
responsibility on him for defeating
Stanford in the hammer throw, where
he will be hard pressed to beat Wel
ler and Crawford. The relay race is
an open affair.
STANFORD MEN ARE READY.
Are Confident of Winning the Big
Field Day Cliftmpionship.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 14.
The athletes who are to support the
colors of the cardinal in the intercol
legiate track meet with the University
of California to-morrow afternoon are
all ready for the fray. Trainer "Dad"
Moulton, who knows all of the tricks
of the training trade, has succeeded
in rounding the Stanford team into
superb shape. "Every man," he said
to-night, "is in trim to run the race
of his life. Unless there are some star
tling surprises on the Berkeley side or
some sudden reversal of form among
our men, and I do not anticipate either,
1 don't see how we can be prevented
from winning the meet. We are strong
er than ever because we have an even
ly rounded team, although we have lost
seme of the stars of past years. The
Berkeley track will bother us a Jittle,
bht I do not think the final outcome
of the meet will be affected by it."
It does seem the Berkeley cinder path
is the only thing that can possibly
defeat the cardinal team this year. The
track at Stanford, where the men have
spent the last six months industrious
ly practicing, is a quarter mile affair,
with the turns only slightly raised.
The blue and gold track, on the other
hand, is a short oval with high banks
on the turns. So troublesome are these
elevated curves to the uninitiated
sprinter that he must either slacken
his speed or run off Into the ditch. It
is even a greater hardship on the hur
dlers, who have to jump as well as
run. The Callfornians have the ad

nearly sold out.
The first event to be held under the
management of the new . organization
will take place at Vallejo on Decora
tion day. The programme was arranged
at a meeting held at the Vallejo Yacht
ing and Rowing Club house last Sun
day. Vice Commodore Brown presided
and F. V. F. Baker was present as a
representative of the P. A. A. O. The
programme includes senior, interme
diate and junior barge races, a four
oared shell race, senior and junior out
rigged skiff races, senior and junior
single shell races and a naval cutter

trand, bow; A. J. McKerron, No. 2: T.
Harris, No. 3. and W. Harris, stroke.
The foregoing have already begun to
train for the event. The Junior barge
crew consists of T. O'Brien, bow; L. C.
Richmond, No. 2; William Remens
perger. No. 3, and H. McKevitt. stroke.
Gerald KennifT will be cockswain of
both crews. F. J. Sherry is training for
the senior outrigged skiff race and
Steve Vlclni for the junior skin* event.
It was expected that Oscar Mohr would
represent the Dolphin Club In the out
rigged skiff as well as Steve Vicini, but
he has gone to Fresno on business and
will remain there for the next six
months, so that the Dolphins will lose
his services during the coming season.
Gaelic Football To-Morrow.
The first great game for the Gaelic
football championship of California
will take place to-morrow afternoon,
commencing promptly at 3 o'clock on
the Presidio athletic grounds. The
contesting teams will be the celebrat
ed Parnells and the famous Emeralds.
The Parnells, winners of last season's
championship, are determined not to
lost their honors. The Emeralds have
been entirely reorganized under the
leadership of their skipper, J. J. Bar
ry. The manner in which Captain
Barry handled his team was striking
ly shown in their previous contest.
T. J. Mellott has been appointed
referee of the game.
vantage this year because they have
trained the season through on their
home track, and their sprinters and
hurdlers speed along the turns as easi
ly as though they were running along
the smoothest straightaway. In or
der that the men should labor under
as slight a disadvantage as possible the
Stanford manager has taken the team
to Berkeley at different times during
the season, so that they are fairly well
acquainted with the track there.
Stanford expects to get a place In
the hundred with either "Woods or Ed
wards, both of whom have done the
sprint in ten and one-nfth seconds.
Woods will make the mighty Snedigar
hurry in the two hundred and twenty
yard event. Both men are running in
twenty-three seconds. Freshman Mil
ler is entered to annex the quarter, half
and mile runs for the cardinal team.
Such a feat has never been accom
plished before in the history of coast
athletics. Moulton is confident that his
protege is equal to the task. The two
mile is conceded to California with
Stanford second. The cardinal counts
on winning both hurdles, the relay the
pole vault and the hammer throw. The
broad jump is a toss up between Snedi
gar and Weller. Berkeley is conceded
the shot-put and possibly the high
jump. In short, Stanford ought, on
form, to get severity-five points in the
meet, twelve more than is necessary to
win.
TROUT STRIKE
AT THE FLIES
Streams Are Clearing I'n
der the Prevailing Favor
able Weather Conditions
With the continued clear weather the
trout streams within easy reach of this
city are clearing steadily, and the men
who scorn to use bait are taking good
baskets of fteh on the more sportsman
like fly. The best results have been ob
tained with the brown wing, royal
coachman, black gnat and the gray and
brown hackle. The small number 14
hook is the most used.
Al Cumming, who knows the trout
streams of the high Sierras as it is
given few men to know them, will leave
on the 23d mat. with a party of friends
for the Klamath River. Reports re
ceived from there are to the effect that
the river is fast getting Into shape for
flyfishing. Mr. Cummings has always
been successful there, especially on
Shovel Creek, which yields thousands
of rainbow trout to sportsmen each
year. This is one of the most prolific
streams in the State. The trip from
this city requires one day's travel on
train and stage.
The Truckee is still high, although
some fish are being taken on salmon
roe. The fish are reported to average
smaller "than those of last year. The
upper Sacramento and the McCloud are
reported in the same condition as the
Truckee. They will remain high for
some time.
Austin Creek, near Cazadero, should
afford good sport from now on. Many
large fish went up there to spawn last
winter.
Doc Watt. James Lynch and several
friends leave to-night for the Sur, near
Santa Cruz, where they expect some
good sport.
Los Gatos Creek is said to be yield
ing good returns now. but the sport will
not last long, as this is an early stream.
The members of the San Francisco
Flycasting Club, the most famous or
ganization of its kind in the world, will
entertain Dr. Henry Van Dyke, the
famous Princeton scholar, at dinner on
"Wednesday evening at the California
Hotel. Charles S. Wheeler Is at the
head of the committee having the af
fair in charge. This means a flow ut
wit and a feast of reason, which will be
worth while. The name of that other
sage of Princeton, Grover Cleveland, an
honorary member of the club, wijl
evoke enthusiasm which will astonish
the honored guest of the evening.
William Halstead went to Tocaloma,
on the Paper Mill, early in the week
and secured a limit basket. His priae
flsh was a three-pound steelhead.
Among the regulars on the stream last
Sunday who caught from twenty to
fifty good-sized trout were:
Jabei Swan. Charles Breldensteln. James

ROXHARDT'S HOUSEKEEPER
COMPROMISES BLCR ACTION
Accepts Much Smaller Sum Than
Ttiat She Demanded for Services
Rendered Capitalist.
For twenty-threÂ« years Mrs. Hattie
Ward served as housekeeper In the
home of the late John B. Reinhardt,
â who, though he lived In humble quar
lers at 294 Natoma street, left an
estate of great value. When Rein
hardt died and his will was read, Mrs.
Ward, who had hoped for a gift !n
his testament sufficiently large to in
sure her comfort during her remaining
years, found that she had been left
but (4000.
appointed, if not angry, she re
pudiated the devise and filed suit
against the estate through a relative,
to whom she assigned her claim, for
$20,000 as housekeeper and agent
and another for $27,000 for services as
plain housekeeper, with no demand for
condensation for services rendered in
any confidential capacity. Mrs. Char-
Brand and Flora Louise Morton,
heirs of the deceased, though confident
that Mrs. Ward was entitled to more
than the sum of the bequest in, her
favor, were positive she was en
tilled to no such cum as she sued
for, and since the death of the testa
tor on April IT, 1903, they carried on
with her negotiations looking to a
I romise.
It was only recently that they suc
i in convincing Mrs. Ward that
id be defeated in court and
â  >-d a release of all claims she
nst the estate upon the
rof $6340. This release
:es the legaxy Of $4000, upon
which she now has no further claim.
Otto Lemcke. executor of the deced
ent's will, set forth the facts as given
above in a petition filed yesterday,
asking the court to ratify the compro
mise. If the court agrees that it is
equitable Mrs. Ward will get her
money and the estate, which â¢ was
threatened with long and expensive
litigation, will be near final settlement-

Seals Score Twice on
a Pair of Lucky
Shots.
Tacoma Starts Well
but Falls by the
Wayside.
The Seals' victory over the Tigers at
Recreation Park yesterday was not due
to any alarming work with the stick,
but more to good fortune a^d the laws
of chance. The Seals made two runs
on a pair of skimpy little hits, while
the Tigers banged away safely eight
times, and still their share was but a
run. Scoreâ San Francisco 2, Tacoma 1.
Brown, the grocery pitcher, thought
he was dealing out sacks of flour and
sides of bacon to the Seals. He might
as well, for all the harm they did.
Brown should have won his game, and
every one in the lot thought he would
triumph when the Tigers waded in
strongly during the first round and sent
a run through without hesitating.
Doyle opened the game for the Tigers
with a wallop to left tield that was
good for two stations. Sheehan also
banged eafely. Nordyke slapped to Ir
win. who threw badly to first. Casey
got a hit, which scored Doyle. The rest
of the gang died on the bases, although
it seemed a dozen -runs would be made.
Wilson registered for the Seals in the
Ofth on a base on balls, an error and a
fly. The winning run was enticed home
during the next period, when Hilde
brani tore off a hit, advanced to second
on Irwin's sacrifice, took third on a
tralk and came in on Nealon's long fly
to the right garden.
Both teams put up an inferior article
of ball, and although the score was
small and the errors few, the game waa
one of the slowest yet played. None of
the players had any life in them, and
they seemed content with standing up
and banging away at the sphere just
because they had to do something to
earn their salaries. The score:

CHIEF SULLIVAN REDUCES
WORK. OF EXGIXE COMPANIES
Scarcity of Horses Compels Head of
Fire Department to Reduce
Number of Assignments,
Owing to the poor condition of the
horses of the Fire Department at the
present time and the inability of the
department to procure animals that
would come up to requirements Chief
Sullivan has temporarily reduced the
first alarm assignments of many en
gine companies, especially in the mer
cantile and manufacturing districts,
where fire calls are frequent. His
purpose is to lighten the work of the
horses as much as possible. The fol
lowing first call box numbers wer2
takt-n off the different engine assign
ments:
Engine 2, 66; 3, 1; 4, 15; 5, 1; 6, 10;
9, 5; 10, 12; 12, 4; 14, 3; 17, 6; 28, 3;
29, 6; 85, 4; 38. 5; truck 10, 2; chem
ical 1, 7; 8, 7; 5, 1; 6, 15.
For failing to report promptly to
his engine-house after completing his
detail at a theater W. J. Olsen of En
gin* 13 was found guilty of neglect
of duty and fined fifteen days' pay by
the Fire Commissioners at their meet
ing yesterday afternoon. It will cost
William Crawhall five days' pay for
not registering in the journal of the
nrehouse the exact time when Olsen
reported back.
The Commisisoners left it to Chief
Sullivan to decide how long a vaca
tion the mechanics of the department
should he allowed.
A communication was received
from Congressman Kahn stating that
volumes of reading matter of interest
to firemen would be distributed among
the firehouses of his district for th-j
perusal the firemen during their
leisure hours.
The following changes were made:
James Buckley, from acting liÂ«iuen-
MÂ»t ot Engine Company 34 to hos3
man of Engine Company 21; J. Aug
ust Imbrie, from engineer. Engine
Company 15, to temporary lieutenant,
Engine Company 16; Fred Meyer,

Giants to gulp down this afternoon at
the Idora Park baseball grounds.
The big fellows who have been win
ning twelve and sixteen inning games
this week did not take their medicine
to-day without a struggle. Of the six
hits mad.- off the opposing boxmen
the White Socks secured four. Two of
these were double baggers, one was a
triple sacket and the other a single.
Bert Jones served the spirals superbly
fur McCreedte's minions, but his pro
verbial hoodoo clung to him, and he
lost a game in which he allowed only
two singles, passed no one and fanned
two.
Van Haltren's vassals did not get
one of their clan on first until the
seventh period, when Krug-er lobbed a
floater over Jakey Atz' topknot. Oom
Paul essayed to steal second when he
imagined nobody was looking, but he
was caught in the act. Oakland's only
and winning tally was scored in the
eighth session. Locomotive King, the
first man up, started one for the score
board and a hat, but Eddie House
holder sprinted along with the screamer
and plucked it from the atmosphere in
spectacular style. Julie Streib smote
the sphere through Schlafiey and pil
fered second and third. Curley Kelly
sent the Dutchman in on a drive to
Clark, which the latter fielded cleverly
to McLean as Streib slid for the plate.
The play was close, but Umpire Davis
ruled that the Teutonic first baseman
was safe. Householder swatted for a
brace of bags in the seventh, and in an
endeavor to make his smash good for
three corners waa captured at third.
McCreedle. who followed Eddie, bang-ed
out a tri-sacker, but his men were
powerless to advance him further. By
winning to-day's contest Oakland and
Portland are tied in the srries. Both
nines are playing the highest class of
baseball, as the small scores and the
extra inning games prove. Score:
Portland â Oakland â

BOXING CLUBS
UNDER THE BAN
Supervisors Are to Be
Asked to Enforce Strict
ly the Existing Ordinances
EVIDENCE CONCLUSIVE
Various Provisions of the
Tjjiw Are Not Complied
With by the Promoters
The long-threatened crusade against
the clubs promoting so-called amateur
prize fights was commenced in earnest
yesterday by the Grand Jury. The first
token of its work was seen in the post
ponement of the exhibition planned by
the Hayes Valley Club for last night in
Woodward's Pavilion.
The Chief of Police was notified by
Foreman T. P. Andrews of thÂ« Orand
Jury that the promoting club had not
complied with the law and he was
asked to stop the affair. Manager Mor
ris Levy was communicated with, and
he at once ordered the fights postponed
pending the action of the Supervisors
on Monday.
William Greer Harrison was the com
plaining- witness against the Hayes
Valley Club. Lundy and Cairns, who
were to have been the principals in the
main bout, were represented by their
respective managers, Archibald Taylor
and George Pollard.
It developed that the winner of the
fight was to get $100 and the loser $50,
no mention being made of a medal or
other trophy, which is required by the
amateur rules.
FOREMAN ANDREWS' POSITION.
Foreman Andrews said after the
meeting: "We are convinced from the
evidence we have collected that the
clubs promoting these professional
bouts on an amateur license are mu
tual get-rich-quick concerns and that
some one profits financially by the is
suance of these licenses contrary to
law. This club has not the member
ship of 250 required by law. The fights
were not to be held in its gymnasium.
The club doctor had not filed his certi
ficate regarding the physical fitness of
the men to enter the ring. The permit
granted for last night's exhibition was
for amateur bouts, yet there was a
purse of gold offered for the winner,
which is contrary to amateur law the
world over. The promoters have been
waxing rich for years on these miser
able exhibitions, in which mere boys
fight like tigers for a pittance.. The
law must be enforced, no matter who
suffers."
Prize-fighting never did lend itself to
amateurism, and it has always been a
strain on the honesty of the persons
who have followed it for a living. No
matter how high a standard of moral
ity a fighter has had, it is notorious
that few of them can withstand the
temptation to fake after a few con
tests. They do not see why they shoved
stand up and have their heads knocked
off for the amusement of men they do
not know when they can arrange the
little details in private and get the
money without risk of injury or loss of
reputation.
QUARREL AMON"G PROMOTERS.
The present sensation is In reality
another outbreak In the feud between
the promoters of professional fights.
When the Ralston bill was being
pressed at Sacramento Manager Jim
Coffroth and others called on Mr. Har
rison and showed him where the
passage of the bill would not cure the
evils of boxing. It permitted amateur
bouts, and they pointed out that un
scrupulous managers could readily
evade its provisions. Mr. Harrison saw
the strength of the argument and de
cided to use his wide influence In
stamping out the evil.
The officials of the Pacific Athletic
Association, which controlled boxing
until some of the clubs seceded and
formed an organization of their own,
placed a mass of Information at the
disposal of Mr. Harrison. He in turn
presented it to the Grand Jury, and
yesterday's action is the result. It will
probably be passed up to the Super
visors on Monday in addition to their
other fight troubles.
The promoters claim they are allowed
to pay the reasonable training ex
l>Â«nsrs of boxers. This is the point on
which the case hangs. No attempt is
made to conceal the fact that boxers
have been paid for years by every club
which has promoted fights, but the
compensation of the boxers has been
in the guise of training expenses.
INTERUNIVERSITY BOAT
CONTEST IS NOT ROWED
There was no interuniversity boat
race yesterday at Sausalito. The crew
of the Washington University was on
hand with its racing four-oared shell,
while the Stanford men were present
without a boat.
On behalf of the cardinal men it
was stated that orders had been given
to the Peterson Launch Company to
bring the shell up from Redwood
City, but that through a misunder
standing the order was not executed.
The weather was fine and the water
in Richardson Bay smooth.
After much discussion it was agreed
that the crews of Stanford and Wash
ington shall meet at Sau3alito on Mon
day morning at 10 o'clock, when the
race will be rowed over a two-mile
course from the ferry slip northward
to Waldo Point.
The question of weighing the shell
of the Washington crew in the race
with the University of California,
which will be rowed on the Oakland
estuary to-day at 9:45 a. m. and which
for a time seemed likely to cause a
disagreement in the arrangements for
the race, has finally been settled in a
manner satisfactory to the coaches of
both, crews.
The hitch was caused by the fact
that there is no coxswain in the
Washington boat, this making a great
difference in the weights carried by
the two boats. In the race to-morrow
the California boat will carry In the
coxswain alone 110 pounds more live
weight than Washington, it is to off
set this difference that forty pounds
of dead weight must be added to the
Washington boat.

HIGH CHANCELLOR DEFEATS HONITON
Dan Collins Drops
In, Backed Off
the Boards.
Double Six Downs
Clausus by a
Short Neck.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
High Chancellor met Honiton with
the difference in weights twenty
pounds in his favor, and defeated
"Packey" Ryan's great mare for the
seven-furlong handicap yesterday at
Oakland. The wise ones strung their
checks on the chances of Honiton,
making the mare a pronounced choice.
She met with splendid racing luck
throughout and it was only in the last
few strikes that Harry Larsen got up
on the inside with High Chancellor,
earning a head decision In 1:26%. Prin
cess Titania, the early pacemaker, fin
ished third.
After filk straight favorites had tak
en the count, Leila managed to draw
down the last purse, going to the post
at odds of 11 to 10. The splendid card
drew a large attendance.
Equorum Rex, the favorite, with
Minder in the saddle, got no part of
the money in the 2-year-old dash at
half a mile. Well played at 4 to 1, Sir
Edward was in front all the way, win
ning cleverly from Midmont and Bill
Perry.
McBRIDE'S POOR .TUPGMEXT.
A long suffering public was next
compelled to watch McÃrlde handle
another favorite in his characteristic
style. The Miller stable pilot had the
mount on Hagerdon in the Futurity
course sprint following. The big gel
ding opened at 6 to -fi, the odds soared
to 9to 5, and the story is told. Double
Six, the second choice, received steady
support and in a driving finish downed
Clausus a neck. The show went to
Royal Rogue.
Dan Collins, which had been residing
in the suburbs for quite a period, kick
ed up a rumpus in the six-furlong run
with catch-as-catch-can weights up.
Every sure-shot man at the track
had Dan for the joker in the deck, and
when 20 to 1 was chalked up the ring
resembled the run on a Chinese faro
bank. It looked as if everybody got
aboard but one poor blind man, and he
couldn't see his way clear to reach the
books. When business had somewhat
subsided there was a bit of 4% to 1
still on draught.
KNAPP LANDS > THE OUTSIDER.
The good thing's cargo consisted of
Knapp and 121 pounds. With the ease
that an elephant displays in packing a
howdah, Dan Collins dropped his bur
den nearly three lengths ahead of Red
mont and Revolt at the wire. Royal
White, the favorite, finished somewhere
back among the" spear- bearers.
It's a box of seidiitz powders to a
ferry-boat beefsteak that Frank Sulli
van's broken collarbone did not take
nearly so long to mend as will the frac
ture sustained by the admirers of
Golden Ivy, the favorite, on which he
finished third in the mile and seventy
yard run. Frank did the best he could,
but still lacks strength with which to
finish on. Esherin, ridden by Lloyd
Fountain and second choice, led from
the kick-off, beating Flaunt nearly a
length. Golden Ivy ran third.
Nothing but coin of the realm found
its way into the books on Leila to take
the concluding mile run. She won
easily from Ralph Young. Forest King
finished third.
TRACK NOTES.
Jakle Jones finally found his way
into the winner's circle with Sir Ed
ward.
Harry Larsen had on his riding
clothes for sure, piloting three win
ners.
Perhaps at the Ascot Park bottling
works uncorkings like Dan Collins
were of frequent occurrence, but it
was too highly charged for this end of
the line. The entries of Fred Baird's
stable were ordered refused in future
by the judges.
The conditions of a novel race are
being arranged for the closing day at
Oakland between two of the smallest
ponies in the country. Thomas H.
Williams Jr., the young son of the
president of the jockey club, is the
possessor of a Shetland thirty inches
tall and weighing 180 pounds. J. K.
Frayllng, trainer for C. Stubenbord,
has a Welch pony thirty-three inches
in height, tipping the scales at 128^
pounds. The distance will probably
be 100 yards, with a silver cup as the
trophy. Roscoe Coleman and "Cricket"
Kelly have already been mentioned to
do the riding, each being in the spider
weight class.
The crack three-year-old Celeres is
jUBt as good as sold to Edwin Gaylord.
The wealthy Denver horseman has
forwarded the $5000 asked for the
son of Maxlo, and Trainer George Bur
ger notified the present owner of
Celeres yesterday that the money is at
his disposal.
Riflemen at Important Meet.
The riflemen of this city, Oakland,
Sacramento and San Jose have been in
dustriously practicing for the annual
spring shoot of the California Schuet
zen Club, which will be held to-mor
row at Schuetzen Park, San Rafael.
There are some expert marksmen from
the East at present in the city and
they intend to make it interesting for
the California experts. The coast
marksmen have taken up the chal
lenge and aver that the first prizes will
remain with the home guard. The
trophies contributed for this occasion
are the best and most valuable offered
for rifle practice and will be hotly con
tested for.
Mowatt and Yanger Fight a Draw.
KALAMAZOO, Mich., April 14.â
Benny Yanger and Tommy Mowatt
fought twenty rounds to a draw to
night before more than 3000 persons.
The first round was Yanger's, but after
that Mowatt took the lead and main
tained it to the end of the fight.
Neither fighter sustained much pun
ishment. Yanger displayed great cau
tion throughout the fighting, surpass
ing his opponent in this department.
Mowatt did more leading, especially in
the last dozen rounds. The men mixed
it frequently and the referee was busy
most of the time parting the boxers.

BANNER ATTENDANCE SEES
THE SPORTSMEN'S SHOW
Boxing Boot Between Jimmy Brltt
and Frankie Neil Proves a Big
Attraction.
The largest crowd since the open
ing of the Forest, Fish and Game Ex
hibition attended last night. It wu
Sierra Club and Shamrock night. A
stereopticon lecture was given in the
art gallery by Professor LÂ» Conte and
William Colby. Pictures of different
places visited by the club during its
jaunts and pictures of Mount Rainier
were shown, which place the club will
visit this year.
One thing which probably attracted
many was a three-round friendly box
ing bout between Jimmy Britt and
Frankie Nell. At times it resembled
the real article, both boxers sending
in blows fast and hard.
This afternoon a Chinese baby show
will be held. In the evening ft will
be military night, and a competitive
drill between First Corps Cadets.
Cavalry Reserve Corps. Starr King
Cadets. Columbia Park Boys' Club.
Raider Reserve Corps and Roosevelt
Boys' Club will be held on the main
floor. The exhibition will clos^
morrow nisrht and the management
ha 3 decided to reduce th-Â» admission
to 25 cents on the last day.

POLICE BOARD
ACTS TARDILY
Orders Saloon Men to Stop
Poolselling by the Time
Racing Season Is Over
As a result of the Grand Jury crusade
against the poolroom evil in this city,
five saloon men were before the Board
of Police Commissioners last night on
citations for the revocation of their
licenses. Evidence had been gathered
by the Grand Jury detectives showing
that pools on the races were sold in
cigar stores of which the saloon pro
prietors were the lessors. The Com
missioners gave the saloon men three
weeks to show their good faith by
stopping their tenants from selling
pools. This puts the final decision on
the revocation of the licenses over until
May 5. The last race of the season
will be run at Emeryville on the fol
lowing day and pool selling will then
cease.
The saloon of John W. Kelly at 131
O'Farrell street was the first place
under investigation. Kelly took the
stand and declared that he wanted
pool selling stopped on his premises,
but his tenants had a lease, he ex
plained, and he had been advised that
they could not be dispossessed unless
a conviction of pool selling was se
cured.
At this juncture President Poheim
called Attorney Newburgh to the
stand in an effort to discredit the Dis
trict Attorney's office by making it
appear that poolselling cases had been
dismissed because of faulty drawing
up of complaints. Poheim's silly at
tempt provoked a heated wrangle.
Detective Smith was placed on the
stand to testify as to bets that he had
seen made at the cigar store in front
of Greggains & Sullivan's establish
ment at 112 Ellis street on March 18.
Smith said incidentally that he had
seen a piliceman wearing star 109
standing near the place for over half
an hour. It was proved by the defense
that Officer Hayden was wearing the
star in question. He was not on duty
at the time, it was speciously pleaded.
The Grand Jury detective next tes
tified that he had placed a bet on a
race in the room back of the cigar
store at 126 O'Farrell street. Chris
tiansen & Kenyon are the proprietors
of the saloon. Attorney N'ewburgh
for the defense endeavored to ascer
tain the compensation received by
Smith from the Grand Jury for his
services. He also endeavored to show
that Smith was an assumed name and
inquired about his former history.
Upon Foreman Andrews' instructions
Smith refused to answer the questions
propounded.
In the cases of W. H. Rice. 129
O'Farrell street, and John L. Herget.
Golden Gate avenue and Taylor street,
the testimony of Smith was to the ef
fect that h$ had placed a bet in the
poolroom In front of Rice's resort and
had seen bets made at the cigar store
in front of Herget's saloon. The tes
timony adduced by the defense showed
that the tenants of the cigar stores in
both cases held leases and could not
legally be dispossessed.
President Poheim. in rendering the
decision of the commission, stated
that the saloonmen were believed to
be. responsible for their tenants. It
wji.Â«t decided to continue the matter
for three weeks before a final decision,
and if the liokor men were acting in
good faith, he said, they would in ;he
meantime assist in suppressing the
poolselling. Commissioner Reagan
dissented from the opinion of the,
other members of the board. He de
clared that the evidence in the case
of Greggains and Sullivan did not
show that dools were sold on the
premises. He was in favor of revok
ing the licenses of Rice and also of
Christiansen and Kenyon. In Herget's
case he thought the evidence was in
sufficient.

COTTON â market was under pressure
most of the day. ThÂ« bears claim If they get
prices a few points lower they will catch a
good many stop orders and shake out some
-street pools which have been picking up
cotton for the last two or three weeks, but on
the whole there was no rlpn -of their selling
any. . While the general opinion Is that . tbe
acreage will not chow suet curtailment as -was
expected some time ago. If prices remain low
It leads us to believe that it **â¢!;: be decreased.
If it is decreased five to ten per cent this
means two to three million acres less and with
a crop ten days to two weeks late.
COFFEEâ market showed much better
tendency than for some time past. This was
Co doubt due In a great measure to the im
provement in the foreign market. Liquidation
In the month Is now believed to be nearly over
and a change for the better In prices Is ex
pected. ' : ~Y\

NEW YORK, April 14.â A revival of th*
Northern Securities settlement excitement re
sulted In a speculative revel on thefstock Ex
change. which spread pretty generally through
out the list, but thÂ« conspicuous fact about the
day* operations was their enormous . conges
tion- in the few stocks Immediately affected by
the current rumors, especially Union Pacific,
St Paul. New Tork Central, and. on the curb.
Northern Securities it*elf. The last named
clock bounded up to the neighborhood of 180.
thus justifying predictions which â  have been
current among street speculative operators for
some time. . but without obtaining .general
crefienoe. The rumors to account for- the ad
vance â .â¢â¢:. many- and various and for the
most part exceedingly vague. That which was
most definitely formulated alleged an intention
to double the present volume of Great North
ern preferred stock for purposes which were
very <itm!y indicated in the story as circulated.
The capitalization of enormous values discov
ered in iron orÂ« lands -in the company's pos
reeeion \vaÂ» hinted at, Great Northern pre-
slng :%l."><g:4So, with no sales, the iart
I been at 312. It waa argued that
this develQpment would greatly expand the
f* -t^^lue of â¢.he Northern Securities Company
about to be distributed under the order of dis
solution of the f?ui>reme Court. As a large
proportion Â«f this distribution will fall to .the
Union Pacific treasury, that stock was held
to be entitled to a corresponding advance, but
with the excitement started in the market tbi>
'â¢ x ; ,:& n&tk-a t Â«iF deemed - inadequate and eur
xniee fell back upon the supposed uses to which
the Ir.i'.n Pacific preferred stock is to be put.
Tbis line of conjecture led to the recovery in
various stocks pointed/ to as a desired object
<jf acquisition by Union Pacific, but . which
have been dropped out of consideration for a
time with the growth of skepticism over the
etorles current. The stories are as. entirely
without official authority or admission to-day
its at any time. The palpable fact, howover,
was thai almost unlimited amounts of the
Mocks most nearly concerned passed constantly
through the market all day, and the absorptive
power for them seemed insatiable. The volume
of transactions and the movement of prices In
the general railroad list was moderate and the
extent of the price movement was found on
careJu! scrutiny, not to be very wide, but In
the industrial department â¢ there was effective
supplement to the striking movements in the
t ranscontiner.tal group. In this department
i- .Â« ., the moet prominent 1 g 'â¢ grade industrials,
especially United States Steel preferred, were
inclined to move narrowly. Of industrials of
miner clase, however, there is a long list which
made advances during the day of all the way
from one to three or four points. The brilliant
ocnfiitlcns shown to exist In the iron and steel
trade by the statistics of production and con-
Fumptlon have served to give great authority
to ihe incoming reports of highly prosperous
conditions in all departments of trade. The
Tavor Â«hown to the industrial stocks . Increases
accordingly. It is found easy, to effect move
ments by formation of pools In many of these
nocks, and it is not unusual for the rise to be
heralded by some such announcement as that
"arrangements have been made for a sharp
upward movement" In this stock or that stock
The movement is' pretty sure to follow. Oper
ations cf this class, however, do not tend to
fortify confidence in the market. The cur
rency movement tor the week gave promise of
â  good cash gain by the banks, and ottered
no obstacle to the maintenance of the specula
tion. The irregular closing left prices not far
below the best of the day.

CHTCAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, April 14. â Weakness In the wheat
market developed soon after the opening. Con
siderable firmness, however, was manifested
at the start. July being up HÂ©%c at 88%Â©
BS?ic. May was unchanged to %o higher at
?! ir,?4@i 17%. The Initial strength was dvÂ»
primarily to higher prices at Liverpool, but
cold weather accompanied by mow in the
Northwest continued. As an offset to un
favorable weather conditions in the Northwest
reports from the Southwest told of rains m
sections of the winter wheat belt, wherÂ»
moisture was greatly needed. Another faotoi
that helped to create a bearish sentiment waa
an increase In shipments from Argentina.
Soon after the opening a large long began to
sell heavily. Pit traders eagerly followed ths
lead. The result was one of weakening of
the market generally. As trading progressed
prices continued to decline. Fresh impetus
was given the declining tendency by a sharp
bieak in prices at Minneapolis. Advices re
garding the condition of winter wheat were
conflicting, but those of a bearish character
setmed to predominate. A St. Louis traae.
Journal In Its weekly report stated that the
conditions of the crop generally were satis
factory and above the average for this time
of the year. The May delivery was under
moderate selling pressure the entire day, and
with little apparent support showed more
weakness than distant futures. The closing
price for May was at the lowest point of
the day. $1 14%. July, after selling down to
87% c. closed easy at 87% c.
Liquidation by several local longs caused
weakness in tho corn market. The decline in
wheat was largely responsible for the selling
pressure. The market was quite firm at the
start as a result of small receipts, but as
easier tone Boon developed. Lower prices for
cash corn had some Influence. July opened a
shade to %@!4c higher at 48%@48\c sold
off to 49%@4Â»%c and closed at 48% c.
Sentiment In the oat market was bearish
on crop predictions of an Increase in move
ment. Commission houses were prominent
sellers and the demand was light. Pit traders
were the chief buyers. July opened unchanged
to %c higher at 30%<g>30%e. sold down to 30c,
and closed at the lowest point of the day.
Looal receipts were nfty-slx cars.
Provisions were Inclined to hold fairly stead;
early In the day, but later considerable weak
ness developed along with the decline m
grains. Packers were moderate sellers. At
the close July pork was off 10c. lard was
down 5c and ribs were 5@7%c lower.

Potatoes. Onions and Vegetables.
The market for old Potatoes ruled firm at
stiff prices, with a good demand for both table
and aeed descriptions. A steamer was at hand
with. fresh supplies of Oregon Burbanks, but
they had not been unloaded up to a late hour.
New Potatoes were weak, receipts being heavy
and the carry-over from tho preceding day
large. The situation In Onions was unchanged.
There were no Oregons offering from first
hands and Australians were moving freely at
unchanged rates.
Miscellaneous vegetables were generally firm
under a brisk demand for local use and ship
ping. Rhubarb was the only weak descrip
tion and carried- over lots were being offered

CAUSES STRIFE
In a contest for the custody of two
Ifttlc girls in Judge Graham's
yesterday morning Mrs. Cynthia
Mar'-kle of Santa Rosa, their grand
mother, attempted to escort the Fred
erick H. Brown family skeleton into the
open. Only the quick interference of
â urt and the expressed devotion of
the youngsters for their grandmother
S hi-v purpose, but at the end of it
all she walked tway with the children
in her custody.
Frederick H. Brown, now reputed to
be worth Jlftft.onfi. the result of success
ful deal? in oil. was divorced from his
Lavina G. Brown, a year ago.
Since then their children, Cynthia, aged
t> year?. a.nd Sihyi. 7 years old, have
enjoying life at the grandmother
er's country home. Anxious to have
their custody. Mrs. Brown sought an
order of court transferring them from
the custody of her mother, Mrs.
Marckie.
Brown, accompanied by his former
v.ife, went to the City Hall yesterday
in an automobile. V.'hen the case was
Â«alled Mrs. Brown said:
I am very fond of my little ones and
wart their ftufly. 1 do not think my
her should have them, as she is not
- to car* for them as 1 am."
But you are not a fit person to have
them." said Mrs. Marckie. "A woman
that would live with her husband after
she divorced him is not a person to care
hildren." conceded the old lady,
angrily.
Now. let's not quarrel over this mat
ter." said thf court. "Let us see what
the little one*, would like to do."
ing the children to his side Judge
Grahim asked them which they wouid
rather do. live in the city with their
mother, go with their father, who was
able to give them all they could wish
for. or go again into the country among
the green gTass and the flowers to play.

paid. It was nice where she lived and
she was very kind to them.
This settled the case, and Judge Gra
ham refused to alter the order hereto
fore issued, and the youngsters again
took up their station beside their
grandmother.
NOTHING FOR SUPPORT.
â "And," said Mrs. Marckie, the father
of these little ones has not contributed
one cent toward their support during
the year I have had them, though he
rides around in automobiles and enjoys
his wealth."
The court gave Brown until Friday
to pay $?.00 for the maintenance of the
little ones for the year just passed. If
he fails to obey the order of court he
must show full cause for his disobe
dience on the day named.
Alfred E. McMillan and his wife, Isa
bel, who is suing him for a divorce, en
tered into a complicated agreement in
Judge Hebbard's court regarding the
time each shall visit their children,
Charles, Alfred and George Ernest Mc-
Millan. Last Sunday McMillan, who is
a marine engineer and vocal instructor
by turns, seized his children while they
were walking along Market street with
their mother and took them to his home
at 1424 O'Farrell street. He was in
court yesterday on a petition for a writ
of habeas corpus sworn out by the
mother to secure possession of the
youngsters.
After some discussion the parents en
tered into an agreement, with which
the court expressed his entire satisfac
tion. They 'agreed that the little ones
should be placed in the custody of Mrs.
E. A. Piercy of 1T77 Mission street. On
odd days of the month, it was further
stipulated. Mrs. McMillan shall have
the right to go to the Piercy home and
remain over night with the little ones,
and on the even days the husband shall
enjoy the same privilege. On odd
nights, if Mrs. McMillan does not de
sire to remain at the Piercy home, she
shall have the right to take one of the
children home with her, and on the
even nights this shall be McMillan's
privilege.
Although Mrs. McMillan will get a
little the best of the deal in months
that end with thirty-one days, McMil
lan seemed to be willing to make this
concession, and the writ was dismissed.
HER TEARS AVAIL HER.
The heart pangs that come to the
children of a broken home were made
evident In Judge Hunt's court, where
Alice L. Carrington sought to get the
custody of her 7-year-old son, who is
living with his father, Bartine Carring
ton, at Santa Rosa. Mrs. Carrington
at the time of the decree was granted
the custody of her little daughter, but
the son was given into the custody of
the father. Yesterday after the case
was heard by Judge Hunt and the court
had decided that the father was caring
well for the boy and that he should re
tain custody of the youngster, his sis
ter, who was in court with her mother,
burst Into tears, and running over to
her brother threw her arms around him
and begged him to leave his father and
go and live with her. The lad also com
menced sobbing, and Clerk Watson
went to comfort them.
"You shouldn't tell your little broth
er to leave your father," said Watson
to the little miss.
"But he told a story on the stand,"
sobbed the little girl. "He wants to keep
my brother and I can't have him. 1
want him to play with me and come
home with mamma."
Out into the corridor walked the two
youngsters, still crying bitterly. Car
rington walked out and looked at them
a moment.
"Dry your tears," said the father to
his children. "Now, son, run along with
your sister and enjoy a vacation with
her for a whole week, and when the
school closes for the summer perhaps
your mother will let her daughter come
over to play with you. You may play
together as much as you like."
Mrs. Carrington took the children and
moved down the corridor. Carrington
watched them until they disappeared
from the building, then he turned and
walked away.

THE SAN T FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 15, 1905.
PINS HIS HOPE
TO HIS LETTERS
So confident is W. F. Whittier, a man
of considerable wealth, that the letters
he wrote to Miss Nellie Henry, who is
suing him for {50,000 damages for
breach of promise, breathe anything
but love that he wants them produced
by her to be used as part of his de
fense. Miss Henry, whose deposition is
being taken, refused to produce them
before the notary, with the result that
Judge Kerrigan was called upon yes
terday to compel Miss Henry to show
cause why she refused to produce the
missives.
Miss Henry was not present, but so
persistent were Whittier's attorneys
that the letters will defeat Miss Hen
ry's claims that Judge Kerrigan agreed
that they must be material evidence,
and issued an order directing Miss Hen
ry to produce them. If she falls to obey
she must show cause for her action.
In her complaint Miss Henry alleges
that she consented on January 1, 1890,
to become Whittier's wife, and awaited
the wedding day with hopes of happi
ness to come, but on August 18, 1903,
Whittier told her he had thought better
of his proposal and would release her
from the engagement. She did Aut want
to be released, she avers, amnsought
to cause him to keep his promise to
marry her, but without avail. Then she
sued for damages to soothe her broken
heart.
Whittier alleges that he never prom
ised to marry Miss Henry, and that the
letters she must now produce will prove
that Miss Henry and he were only
friends, not sweethearts.

EXPULSION FOR
DR. J. I. STEPHEN
Chief Surgeon of Emergency
Service Dropped From San
Francisco Medical Society
NEGLECTS TO PAY DUES
Physicians Say That Other
3fotiYes Prompted Action
of Association Officers
Dr. J. I. Stephen, chief surgeon of
the Emergency Hospital service, who
has gained considerable notoriety
through the alleged neglect of his
duties, is in more trouble. His name
has been dropped from the member
ship of the San Francisco County Med
ical Society. The specific charge against
the medical man is non-payment of
dues, though deeper motives are sug
gested by his colleagues as the reason
that led to his dismissal from the most
important medical association in the
State.
At a meeting of the executive com
mittee, composed of Drs. F. B. Car
penter, Dudley Tait and George Blu
mer, on Tuesda night, the 11th inst.,
the committee Investigated Dr. Ste
phens record and recommended that
he be expelled from the society. The
chief surgeon was forthwith dropped
from the membership roll.
Dr. H. E. Alderson. secretary of the
society, in discussing the matter of
Stephen's expulsion, said: "Yes, we
have dropped Dr. J. I. Stephen from
the membership of the San Francisco
County Medical Society. He was given
ample time in which to pay his dues.
Due notification was sent him prior to
the action of the executive committee,
by registered letter. This failed to
bring any response, so our collector
was sent after Stephen. The collector
was equally unsuccessful in securing
the money from Stephen, so there was
nothing left for us to do but to drop
him from the society."
The collector for the society, who re
fused to give his name, paid: "I have
done some hard jobs in the collection
line, but never had a harder man to
locate than Dr. J. I. Stephen. I finally
landed him â it would be best not to say
where â and was told to call again. I
called again and again, but finally
gave up the job as hopeless."
The bill collector had no more trou
ble in finding Dr. Stephen than did
the hospital attaches a month ago.
when he was wanted to perform capi
tal operations to save the lives of two
emergency patients. Although the hos
pital attendants searched for five hours
at that time they could not locate the
elusive chief.
The officers of the San Francisco
County Medical Society are: Dr. Em
mett Rixford. president; Dr. H. E. Al
derson, secretary. Dr. Frank R. Dray,
treasurer.
UNION PICKET* IN
FEDERAL BUILDING
Stand Guard to Prevent Scabs From
Entering the Office of the U. S.
Stripping Commissioner.
Union pickets of the Coast Seamen's
Union yesterday prevented George C.
Calvert from entering the office of the
United States Shipping Commissioner
for the purpose of signing articles to
go into Alaskan waters as a member
of the crew of the Coalinga. The
pickets were stationed in the corridor
of the Appraisers' building in front
of the door of the Shipping Commis
sioner's office. They demanded to
see his union card and when he re
plied that he was not a union man
they told him that it would be useless
for him to go into the office; that he
would not be allowed to sign papers.
Calvert then went upstairs for protec
tion and was escorted to the shipping
office by United States Secret Service
Agent Harry Moffitt. The captain of
the Coalinga on learning that Calvert
was not a union man refused to ac
cept him. Then Calvert was asked to
join the Coast Seamen's Union, but as
he did not have the initiation fee de
manded he had to leave the place.

SAY TORTURICI
IS MURDERER
Coroner's Jury Brings Ver
dict Charging Fugitive
With Slaying of Vilardo
WIFE 3IAY BE ACCUSED
She Eefuses to Be Sworn as
Her Testimony 3liglit Be
Used Against Her Later
Pietro Tortxtrici stands formally
charged by the Coroner's jury with
the murder of Biaggio Vilardo. His
wife will probably be charged through
other official channels with having
been an accomplice.
Attorney Spinetti, who represented
the wife at the inquest yesterday, ob
jected strenuously to her being called
to testify. His ground was that such
testimony might be used against her.
Coroner Iceland did not force her to
take the stand.
Volubly and intelligently Crispino
Vilardo gave an account of his broth
er's movements up to the time Biaggio
was lost sight of. The most important
point in all his testimony the witness
tried to skim lightly over.
"My brother and I lived for some
time with the father of Joseph Bro
gardo," said Crispino Vilardo. "Bene
detto Fretitta and Rosario Domina
lived in the same house. Joseph Bro
gardo lived there, too."
"Were your brother and Brogardo
good friends?" asked Co-roner Leland-
"Yes, they were very good friends
and were together all the time. When
Brogardo was killed my brother and
Fretitta came to where I was work
ing and wanted me to put in some
money for the funeral. I would not
do it and I did not go to the funeral. "
Even Crispino Vilardo, who was
faithful unto death to his murdered
brother, seemed loth to speak of that
Brogardo affair.
"I dc-nt know why Pietro killed him;
maybe it was over money; maybe over
the Brogardo trouble." And Vilardo
shrugged his shoulders as though he
would like to dismiss the subject.
When the witness had finished De
tective Gibson asked that Rosa Tor
turici be called. Instantly Attorney
Spinetti was on his feet with an ob
jection.
HER ATTORNEY PROTESTS.
"You have no right to swear this
woman and you have no right to make
her give testimony that will be used
against her," declared the lawyer.
"She has been in custody since two
days after the murder and during that
time has made several statements,
seme of them connoting and others â to
say the least â extraordinary."
Assistant District Attorney Louis
Ferarri had the law on the subject
ready. "The Coroner has the right to
examine all witnesses," he contended,
and he quoted a section of the Penal
Code.
"I not only refuse to let her testify,
but I refuse to let her be sworn," Spin
ettl replied. "No person can be made
to give testimony against herself or
himself. She may be charged with
murder. Why coi..pei her to make

statements that may be used against
her? You have not the night."
"We have no desire to ask her ques
tions that will be used against her,"
retorted Ferarri.
"You have already obtained two or
three statements under peculiar <Mr
cumstances," said Suinetti. 'Let those
suffice. If you try to force her to tea
tify she will not be sworn."
"You do not know what questions
will be asked," interposed Coroner Le
land.
"She will not be sworn," asserted
Spinel ti.
The Coroner took the matter under
advisement until the afternoon, when
he decided that he would not force the
woman to take the stand. "Although
I believe that she could be called." he
explained, '"I will not force her to tes
tify, as I believe that she may be tried
for the crime."'
SHE MAY BE IMPLICATED.
It had been expected that the Cor
oner's Jury would implicate Mrs. Tor
turici with her husband.
The verdict found by the jury reads
as follows:
"We, the jury, find that the said
Biaggio Vilardo, age 28. nativity Paler
mo, Sicily, occupation laborer, resi
dence 736*. Green street, in the city
and county of San Francisco, came to
his death at 736^_ Green street on the
sth day of April, IHOS, from shock and
hemorrhage from a compound fracture
of the skull and an incised wound of
the throat at the hands of Pietro Tor
turici. and we hereby charge the said
Pietro Torturlci with the crime of mur
der. John B. Davitt, foreman."
George J. Olivia, who saw the man
with the ghastly burden on the night of
the sth, was the first witness called.
Clearly and concisely he told how he
followed the fellow and finally lost
sight of him near Washington square.
Joseph and Ramon Lanteri told how
they found the head and limbs near
Meiggs wharf. William Barlow cor
roborated their story and said in addi
tion that he had seen the dead man at
Brogardo's "wake."
Detective Braig said the evidence in
dicated that Vilardo was struck down
from behind while eating. City Chem
ist Bothe testified that the murder
must have been committed while the
man was at dinner, or shortly after
ward.
SAW THE WIFE FRIDAY.
E. W. Belger, who lives just above
the room where Vilardo was butchered,
declared that he had seen Mrs. Tortu
rici around the house on Friday. This
directly contradicts one statement made
by the woman to the police.
Mary Corbella told of a conversation
held with Mrs. Torturici the day after
the murder, when detectives were tak
ing the bloody shawl from house to
house. The wife of the fugitive pro
fessed to know nothing about the mur
der.
"Some men were here with a shawl,"
she had said. "I supposed that they
wanted to sell it, but I did not care to
buy."
Detective Coleman visited the Tortu
rici place on the day after the murder.
"Have you missed any lodger?" he
had asked Mrs. Torturlci.
"No," she declared.
"Do you keep any lodger"
"No," she answered emphatically.
The woman was engaged in washing
clothing at the time.
Crispino Vilardo testified that at one
time he also lived with the Torturicis,
but left because Pietro Torturici per
sisted in an effort to borrow money
from him. The witness had decided to
live apart from Biaggio because of a
misunderstanding. The dead man had
ridiculed him for sending money to
their father in Sicily.
Crispino said that he know Mrs.
Torturicis parents in Sicily and that
they were "fine people."
"Do they belong to the Mafla?" asked
the Coroner.
"I do not know," replied Vilardo.
"There is no Mafia except in the mind
of Detective Tom Gibson." declared
Spinetti.
The Coroner's notice to all Sheriffs to
arrest Torturici was sent out last night.
Foreman Andrews of the Grand
Jury, who has received several letters
regarding the supposed ill treatment
of Mrs. Torturici. determined to in
vestigate last night by getting the
opinion of the prisoner herself.
With E. J. Bowes and D. H. Lohsen
two fellow jurors, Foreman And
visited Mrs. Torturici in her cell an<l
with the aid of an interpreter ques
tioned her regarding her treatment
since she was taken into custody Mrs
Torturici expressed her esteem for the
police and detectives with whom she
had come in contact since her Im
prisonment and said that every pos
sible courtesy had been- extended her.
She .had no complaint to. make and
was. extremely grateful Tor the kind
ness shown her, she Mid.
