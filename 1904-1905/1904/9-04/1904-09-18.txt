Dlrth of the Or:!cr in California.
When, upon the discovery of gold in
California in 1S49. the mad rush for
wealth came on from e\'ery quarter of
th<; civilized world. California present
ed oik of th a most remarkable pictures
in the world's history of what econo
mists call th? struggle for existence,
and of the 2\vful visage of the attend
ant of that struggle, "The survival of
the fittest."
Under the motto, "Save himself who
can," human life on the Pacific slope
vas a succession of tragedies In which
ih? cTPtJntioral'v v,>a!'. tnÂ° unfrtrtu
nate. those stricken with disease, or
sudden disabling auction, were left by
th*Â» roadside to thâ¢ uncertain care of
those who dared rot tarry In their race
fcT â¢ wealth, lest the purpose of their
rCventurcus journey thou'd fail and
'.hoy thcrrre'ves be strirken.
i In this environment tho training of
CCA Fellowship asserted itself among
the members cf the order who came
with the army cf go!d seekers, and
they placed their duty to humanity so
far above their duty to themselves (and
indeed s^lf-interest was in those days a
duty which <--ou!d not be liphtly p.ut
aside), "that they paused in the mad
race for wealth to perform that higher
dntv ard to nrov'de for its systematic
performance by themselves and others
through the familiar machinery of the
Subordinate Lodge.
â¢ Pioneer Lo-.l^rcs.
Prc-mpted by these motives and for
the?* purposes, t.'allforria Lodjrp N^. I
of the Independent Order of Odd Fel
lcws. was organized in San Francisco
on the 9th' day of September.. 1849. The
method of its organization and the
means adopted for that purpose were
extraordinary, not to say tragic, in
the earnestness of the brethren inter
ested. 'Members of the order repeatedly
went through the streets ringing bells
and calling upon Odd Fellcsvs fo meet
with them and organize a lodge. These
efforts were made in May and re
peated in August, 1849, succeeding at
last on the 9th of September of that
year, when Brother James Smiley, un
der dispensation from Grand Sire
Horn R.: Kneass. organized California
Lodge No-, 1 with the following named
charter members: Robert H. Taylor,
noble grand: H. W. Herley, vice-grand;
C. E. Franklin, secretary: John M.
Coughlin, treasurer, and Brothers
Julius Rose. William Burling, J>, L.
Da!),-; David Jobson and Lou{3 Tremble.
There m^n. Â«if whom R. H. Taylor (ex-
District Judge) Is the sole survivor,
with a number of brethren holding vis
iting cards from lodges in the 'Atlantic
States. *ho readily/ and earnestly
worked ',with them but would not sur
render membership In their home
lodges to Join the new lodge, nobly
(â¢itrried <>:vthe vork and advanced the
cause cf Odd Fellowship in ; Calif c-rn la.
Unfortunately for the history of" the
Order in California, the records of i. the
parent lodge were ,' destroyedj by,; fire
and its work .in the mc-st interesting,
ancT trying of Bbc early days^is only a
tradition. Large sums of money.are
known to have, been contributed by
CTN HÂ£ Independent Order of "Odd
1 -Fellows', the greatest of American
J fraternal orders, and easily rank-
JL ing second among the fraternal
orders c-f the world, had Us oripin in
the city of Baltimore on the 26th, day
of April. 1S19, and at that time con
sisted of just five members. Thomas
Wildey, John Welch. John Duncan,
John Chcatham and Robert Rush
worth, whose names, with ever â¢ In
creasing veneration, are everywhere
honored by members cf our frater
nity. They founded the order upon and
dedicated it to the principles of
friendship, love and truth, with mutual
relief In distress and sickness, care of
the sick, burial of the dead, relief of
the widows and education of the or
phans of deceased brethren, as .\'ery
important but incidental duties and
purposes. The groat ultimate purpose
being to fraternize the^ world; to make
brotherly love the universal basis of
human relations and the universal-tie
among all races, creeds and nations of
the earth; to make all men feel an in
ward and controlling sense of duty:
To melloiate the KWTpwk ff mankind. _
Relieve tho poor, the sick, the malm'd, the
blind:
Lift up the drooping heart, the widow cheer.
And wlr><i away the helpless orphan'* tear. .
To form of men one -wideeDread brotherhood,
larked In. the bond* of doing good.
Throughout the eighty-five years of
its existence no substantial change has
teen made In. Its fundamental prin
ciples or purposes," but their teaching
and practical application have, during
that period, brought to the order mill
lonsvof earnest and faithful men and,
in later years, hundreds of thousands
of devoted women, all eagerly willing
to devote their lives to the promotion
of the principles and purposes of the
order, satisfied- that this world affords
no better or more certain way to the
reward which surely follows a- well
spent life. Mcst of this work has been
done, nc-t in the glare of day nor be
fore the saze of applauding multitudes,
but in the scrrow-burdened homes of
the poor and In the sorrowful cham
bers of sickness and death. These
duties bring exquisite pleasures a^ well
as trying sorrows to their devotees,
becauee thore who minister to the vic
tims of sickness, pain, suffering and
helplessness soon unconsciously chare
every feeling of relief which' their de
votion brinrrs to those whom they at
tend, and thoroughly enjoy every look
and expression and wx-rd of gratitude
wh'ch their service inspires; they
eoon come to enjoy eucIi service, and,
going beyond the j fraternal circle, as
eagrerly minister to strangers in dis
tress.
On July 5, 1851. San Francisco Lodge
No. 3 was instituted by Deputy Grand
Sire Smiley, in San Francisco, with
Brothers Jesse Boring, Philo White, I.
Joseph^ Edwin Hudson, R. O. Sturdi
yant ' ; M. S. Buckelew, T. Rodgers
Johnson and J. W. Young as the char
teT members. It turned out that the
whole proceeding for the institution of
this lodge was irregular, but that did
not interfere with the earnestness of
its members in the beneficent work of
Odd' Fellowship nor with the splendid
position which that work secured for
it in the history of the order on the
Pacific Coast. It. of course, received
the necessary legal sanction as soon as
possible after the irregularity of Its
organization was discovered.
'Â¦On January 28, 1851, .Sacramento
Lodge No. 2 was ihstituteditb'y 'James
Smiley, who; in the meaptlnie^liad been

C. Collins, N. C, Cunningham, Sambel
Deal. M. Kalisher, G. Hr*Peterson,,
Horatio E. Roberts, ' Robert Robinson
and George W. Wright. The early
work of this lodge was made famous
through the extraordinary and inde
pendent industry of the late Dr. John
F. Morse,' the second grand master of
California, who was afterward hon
ored, with a. special commission as
deputy grand sire to introduce and in
stitute the order in Germany in 1870.
Here, as in San Francisco, brethren
holding visiting cards from Eastern
ledges, devoted themselves with hero
ism and self -sacrifice to the cause of
the order and the general .service of
suffering humanity in that section", of
our new State. " V;

I ;'can perhaps best illustrate the

ment f/om a. brief history of Odd Fel
lowship-In California recently written
t by the late past grand master, Charles
N. Fox, in which he says:
"For fully forty years after the or
ganization of our Grand Lodge the

ing year showed a steady Increase In
membership. Following the financial
crash in ISas,- which affected not only
i our State, b'ut our whole country, there
were four years -pt 'hard times,' such
as we had never experienced before,
during each . of "which there was a
small decrease in membership, but the.
. total decrease for the; four years was
but 567; and in the year 1S98 the mem
bfrrship egain began to increase, and.
it Is, noir mounting upward again and
promises soon tq'reach a number high
er than ifver before. If it has not
already done so. During the period
since the organization â¢ of our Grand
Lodge up to December 31. 1838. there
were initiated lnÂ»this State 6S.473. and
admitted by card 21,576. Withdrawals,

during the same period left us at the
clore of 1S3S with a membership of
30,373, out of a voting population of
287.CG5, or one out of every nine and
forty-Hvo ono-hundrÂ£dths Voters in the

of expenditure is at the rate of 53 C3 I

ders, Underwood, Busby, Campbell,
Stebbins, Carleton, Pinkerton and
Cable yet remain' and we trust that

Sanders of New York, has not missed a

it is not believed that he will fail to

From a handful of men eighty-eight
years ago it has grown to be an asso
ciation in numerical strength and prac
tical ministrations far in advance' of
any other fraternal organization. Its
perfect system j enables it at a mo

thousands -at work in times of emer
gency, as in the cases of the famine in
Ireland, the Chicago fire, the Johns
town flood, the Galveston disaster and
other times of trial tnat might be men
tioned, and this workâ this givingâ has
been and .is . truly twice blessed, for
the giver as well as the receiver shares
equally in the blessing. *
We welcome the representatives to
our* Jurisdiction and to our city by the
, Pacific. Thirty-five years ago they
were the first body of any size to cross
the continent, holding the session of

the then new overland railway.
Thirty-five years have made many
changes in this city '. and State, and
although there will be but few of our

Tht foregoing figures as to member
ship and as to revenue and relief and
invested funds show activity and suc
cess along all lines of work. After the
discharge of the duties of the order
in benevolent work, the saving from
receipts has been such as to accumu
late a vast reserve and invested fund,
which demonstrates a certainty and
ability of meeting and Â¦ discharging all
future obligations in the same work.
Homes for aged and indigent breth
ren, widows and orphans have been es
tablished in a majority of jurisdictions,
two such being successfully maintained
In California. The supreme executive
body is termed the Sovereign Grand
Lodge. It was formerly known as the
Grand Lodge of the United States, but
having chartered lodges In other coun
tries this name was deemed too con
tracted and it was changed in 1879. The
Sovereign Grand Lodge is composed of
two representatives from each Grand
Lodge and Grand Encampment hav
ing over 1,000 members. These repre
sentatives are elected at the sessions of
the Grand Lodges or Grand Encamp
ments by the delegates to the same,
who in their turn are elected by their
subordinate lodges or encampments to
represent them in the grand bodies. It
will therefore be conceded that by the
time a member reaches the Sovereign
Grand Lodge he has had a large prac
tical experience and stands high In the
estimation of his fellow members, and
it Is not egotistical to say that the men
who compose the Sovereign Grand
Lodge of American Odd Fellowship in
point of ability compare favorably with
any legislative body of any character
that meet* in this or any other coun
try. Relieving that it will be of inter
est and information to present in this
article the names of the grand sires
vl the order, their date of service and
residence when elected, they are here
with appended.

This growth to over 1.000,000 mem-,
bers in so short a time is littie short
of marvelous, but it dons not te!l the
whole "story of the order's progress.
According to the late-;t reports th^
membership of the Reb-iliah branch
of the order Is 411.S55. Adding to
the subordinate lodge membership
the lady members of Rebekah lodges '
it is found that the total number of
persons belonging to the order is
1. 329.956.
The peculiar features of American
Odd Fellowship outside of the fraternal
are its practical pecuniary promises to
its members that whether rich or poor,
high or low, learned or unlearned, they
are each alike entitled as a right to be
visited when sick, to receive a specified
amount each week as sick benefits, to
be buried when dead and a specified
amount paid as funeral benefits or
funeral expense, and that their widows
and orphans shall be cared for. To il
lustrate how these promises have been
fulfilled, the reports of the order from
18SiÂ» to Ii<u2 inclusive show 2,6s8,664
brethren have been relieved, 262,253
widowed families have been aid
ed by the ministrations of the
order. 265,525 members have died
in th:-se years and been laid
to rest decently and in order. No Odd
Fellow's body has ever been pressed
into a pauper's coffin or buried in a
pauper's grave, nor have any of the
widows or orphans of a deceased
brother ever "gone over the hills to the
poorhouse." Over $100,000,000 has been
willingly, liberally and fraternally con
tributed for carrying out the command
of our laws, "visit the Elck, relieve thÂ«
distressed, bury the dead, educate the
orphan." In all of this work California
has a proud position which will be
epoken of by another.
The white banner of our order bear
ing the triple links of friendship, love
and truth, Is known in other lands be
tide our own. In Australasia Grand

WITHOUT attempting for a mo
ment to define the causes
which led up to the formation
of fraternal associations, it
will be the aim of the writer
in as brief a. manner as possible to
give some facts and figures relating
to the largest fraternal society the
world has ever known, the Independent
Order of Odd Fellows, or, for the pur-
IÂ»ose of positive specification, the
American order. Odd Fellowship or
institutions doing business under that
general title are numerous, especially
in the Old World, and there art- large
associations, notably the Manchester,
Leeds, Bolton. Birmingham and other
unities, with not less than 1.500,000
members, all doing good work, but In
no wise connected with American Odd
Fellowship. The order of Odd Fellows
originated in England in the eighteenth
century. The celebrated writer, Daniel
De Foe, mentions such a society and
the Gentleman's Magazine of London,
in 1745, speaks of an Odd Fellows'
lodge being "a place where very pleas
ant evenings are spent," and in 17S3
the poet, James Montgomery, wrote a
sens for a body of Odd Fellows, on*
verse of which is often quoted:
When friendship, love and truth abound
Among a band of brothers.
Th* cup of joy goÂ«>s gayly round â
Each shares the bliss of others.
In these early English lodges or so
cieties there is but little doubt they
were mostly of a social character with
very little, if any, ritualistic work,
while at the same time the "help on*
another" principle was practiced. The
headquarters were in London, but a
mechanic, by name Thomas Bolton.
who belonged to a lodge in Manchester,
and a few of his associates in 1S03
founded what is now known as the
Manchester Unity, from which the
American order has descended.
After a number of attempts to
institute a lodge in America Wash
ington Lodge Xo. 1 was formed at the
Seven Stars Ini. in the city of JJal'.l
more, Md.. on Apr;l 26, 1S19. The
founders of the order and the first
Quorum were Thomas Wildey, John
Wt-.fh, John Duncan, Richard Rush
worth and John Cheatham. This
lodge received its charter from the
Duke of York's Lodge of England, ur.
der the rÂ»ther striking title of Wash
ington's Lodge No. 1, the Grind
Lodge of Maryland and of the United
States of America of the Independent
order of Odd Fellowship. This was
the beginning on American soil. With
varying fortunes and still holding re
lations with the Manchester Unity,
the order progressed until 1843. when
after a visit by Grand Secretary
Jr.mes L. Ridgely and Grand Chaplain
IsLiac D. Williamson to England to en
deavor to harmonize matters, the
American order declared itself inde
pendent and sovereign. Its progress
from that date has been simply won

"No higher or greater moral blessing
enriches society than the exalted stand
ard of character which Odd Fellowship
inculcates, inspires and exacts. ' It may
be assumed . as the broad basis upon
which -society rests, to constitute the
nucleus of public virtue and * Its realWHEN Rebekah Odd Fellowship
in California was twenty-one
years oldâ Just old enough to
voteâ she elected to institute
a State body of her Daughters of Re
Â¦ bekah. This Institution "was effected in
the year 1891, and for ' four- years the
body was hailed as a Rebekah^ State
â¢convention^ At the endof, that time it
merged into our regularly chartered as
sembly of the Independent Order of
Odd Fellows of the State of \ California.
# But perhaps 1 the uninitiated "do not
know or fully realize that the Rebekahs
and the Independent Order of Odd Fel
lows are closely allied, and . that the.
workings of one seem scarcely v com
plete- without the other. -In \ the first
place, both are based on 7 the eternal
principles â brotherly love and sympa
thy â and for this reason the two bodies
are being drawn closer and closer, to
gether and their, work is growing
stronger and the field larger. 1 ' I*
â¢ American Odd Fellowship is,a'n evolu
tion from the old English unity. As
early as the eighteenth century lodges
or guilds were formed of London me
chanics, who termed themselves "An
cient and Honorable Odd Fellows." At
first the guilds were both social and
beneficial, though the real underlying
purpose was to scatter a little bright
ness about and to aid suffering human
ity. For this reason. each member con
tributed a penny 'a week for the relief
of the poor and unfortunate .among
them, and this, small as it seems, was'
the humble origin of: the present sys-
tem of beneficence and relief .which to
day stands 'unequaled.
So is it any wonder that as soon as
our great sisterhood had become an
organized whole plans - began to be
formulated for establishing a home
for orphans of deceased members.
These plans had been silent hopes long,
cherished, but heretofore we had
never been' in a position where we
could be a living exemplification of -
our motto, "We Protect and Educate
the Orphan.".
At the time of- the secona session .
of our State body resolutions were* in
troduced and unanimously adopted to,
begin a substantial movement toward
this great achievement, which, by the
way, was â¢ to be known as- the "Odd
Fellows'^ Orphans' Home of Call-.
fornia." Circular letters of informa
tion Â¦Â» and of inquiry were promptly
Issued throughout the Jurisdiction and
jjeneral; Interest. and enthusiasm were
'at., once awakened, for,, you see, Tthe .
prayer the -very -foundation
! of "all "our J/bdges. > Â¦ ,:yj5 Â¦;Â¦Â¦.}.
" , If. was originally intended ,-that.' the;
heme : shoutd"fbe' connected ' with v .the
home for tne -aged and indigent Odd '.
Fellows, their wives and widows; but
later -these plans were changed,^ and
eventually the Orphans'- Home was
located,- established and is now being
maintained by the Rebekah Assembly,
I. O. O. F. of: California, .under rgso-;
lutions adopted by said Rebekah As-
The object j of the home is exactly
the same as any other shelter of its
descriptionâ to take under its kindly
wing homeless and otherwise depend
ent orphans and half -orphan children
of the order and to cheerfully pro
vide them with a home, maintenance
and education as long as it shall be
needed. \
'The home itself is broad \ and
airy and immaculately dean, and
we. try to keep it from looking like a
prison," a school room or the regulation
Institution of this kind. There is pol
icy in this apparent madness. The
daintiness and freshness are there for
a reason and a most excellent one as
well. The girls are instructed to make
the home attractive, to keep it In good
order and to make the very most of
small things, while the boys are
taught to appreciate all that is dono
for them and made to feel less keenly
the loss of their own homes.,
The contract for erection of build
ings was awarded March 11, 1897. and
it was our wish that active work be
commenced immediately, for there were
liny number of tiny tots that needed
a home and good, personal 'care. So,'
accordingly, the cornerstone was . laid
on the Sth day "of May and it was a
very unique service, for it was the
first and only instance in the history
of the order that such a ceremony had
ever been conducted by women. On
the first day of September the com-,
pleted building was formally accepted
by the' board of. trustees and there
â¢was good cause for loud rejoicing, for
the I. O. O. F. Orphans.* Home was en
tirely free from debt. It was, however,
quite the last of November before the
first inmates were admitted and ever
since then the number has grown or
diminished, accqrding to demand, but
at the present timo there ate more than
half a hundred children in the home,
ail receiving the kindliest care and tlvj
greatest protection that it is in the
power- of our Bi3terhood to bestow.
sembly and approved by the Grand
Lodge, I. O. O. F. of the State. of Cali
fornia at the respective sessions of
these grand bodies held in the city of
San Francisco in May, 1896. #
"In this way we were clothed with
authority and promptly * elected a
board of five trustees to carry on the
great Work just undertaken. -Mrs.
Caroling A. Hoxett, Gilroy; Mrs. Mary
E. Donoho, San' Francisco; Mrs. Sarah
M. Wolf, Sacramento; Mrs. Olive T.
Allen, Santa Rosa, ad Mrs. Mary F.
Thorndike of ' Stockton were
chosen ones, so. you see the various
jurisdictions were represented, and it
can be truthfully said t*at not one of
them failed to come to the front with
ready, hearty and substantial aid.
Tinder such circumstances it really
ifn't to be wondered at that in less
than two years from the time Â¦ au
thority for action was received, the
Orphans' Home was a grand, existing
reality.
The love to do good needs a spur.
It is always easier to follow a bright
and shining example than it is to set
it, you know. and. as soon as Mrs.
Caroline A. Hoxett of Gilroy gave a
tract of five acres there were any
number of gratuitous * contributions
from interested and generous lodges
and individuals.
Nor does the work end there either.
Sewing is taught both by hand and by
machine. After the regular sample
book has been finished the pupils learn
how to cut and fit and to fully complete
their own clothes, for this art is a
most excellent weapon and when clev
erly wielded the results are both good
and satisfactory.
In one thing we endeavor to depart
from the regulation rules that general
ly govern such institutions. Every
child la taught to consider himself of
vital importance and that undjr no cir
cumstance is he to be afraid of our
sisterhood or our methods, for we long
since discovered that it is only when
a child's confidence is given fully that
hp is easily and quickly taught.
There really is not much to say of
the good that is being done, for it
speaks for itself and in a way that is
louder and more effective than words.
In fact, it is impossible to hide a light
under a bushel and the home's good
deeds are finding it out.
A few restrictions are always made
in admitting a child, but, of course.
thi3 must necessarily be or else the
whole five acres would be full to flow
ing over. However, any orphan or
half-orphan of deceased Odd Fellow
or Rebekah in good standing has
no trouble -in being tucked away in
a cozy fashion, for they are the un
fortunate little ones we are striving
so hard to reach. The one proviso is
that the child be of sound mind and
is not suffering from any contagious
or infectious disease, for we could ill
afford to turn our home, or even a
part of it, into a hospital.
And so the good work is carried on,
.without much fuss and feather, but
with a quiet persistence, that goes on
and on and that is far reaching.
*
Â±sut tnis is by no manner of means
all they are taught. As.sqon as they
tre old enough they are sent to the
public school, and If they remain on
with us the high school comes next
end they are given every opportunity
to make the most and best of them
selves. After lesson hours come play
and homely but practical lessons in
husbandry and in the skill of a hiuse
wife. Children will be cnildren, as we
/ill know perfectly well, and pray tell,
who o! us would have it otherwise.
"Wh'ile we punish for pranks and antics
we are more than apt to be secretly
amused and the days of our own youth
come back and ' vividly remind us
tliat children are about the same one
generation as they are another. But
water constantly dripping on a stone
will wear it away, you know, and con
stant reminders are bound to make
some impressions, even if the young
sters are busy having a game of tag
or are intsnt on playing "'dare base."
Children are admitted at the home
until they are fourteen years of age.
and by the time' they are ready to
battle with the world they have learned
more than a little of the practical side
of life. And that, by the way, reminds
me. Xo child is sent away from our
care until something better has been
provided. A home with a private fam
ily â adoption or a place to earn a fair,
honest living, for we made it a rule
to protect them Just as long as it should
be necessary, irrespective of age.
Girls are naturally more or less
housewives and they are shown how to
cc ok vegetables, to coax biscuits into
rising and how to keep all the juice in
meats â and some of the pupils are so
skilled in handling pots and kettles
that they put older and more experi
enced cooks decidedly on the defensive.
THE CARE OF THE SISTERHOOD
THE SAN "FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
4properly for such tots, but the wheel of
fate turned once more and stopped at
a cruel place. Instead of the fever
abating, it raged with a fiercer fire un
til nine days after his wife's death the
father and provider went to meet the
helpmate that had so recently crossed
the river from which there la no re
turning.
And so almost In a twinkling eight
.babies were left absolutely alone with
out a soul on the .great earth who cared
what happened to them one way or the
other. It is true enough that the neigh
bors saw that they did not go hungry,
but that was about all; for while every
one had but the kindliest feelings for
the desolate ones there were too many
mouths to feed and too much work to
.do at home.
Just at this time the lodge people
stepped forward to see what could be
done in this matter, for clearly herÂ©
was a problem that nobody seemed
particularly anxious to solve. Both Mr.
and Mrs. Newport were Rebekahs and
Mr. Newport was also an Odd Fellow,
so their children were entitled to all the
benefits that either 'the one or the oth
er, or, in fact, the combined forces of
the institutions, could bestow upon
them.
So after a little delay the entire fam
ily of eight was taken down to Gilroy
and established In the home, and for
five years they have been among the
happiest and the liveliest children in
the place. The eldest, a young miss of
16 years. Is now In the .Gilroy High
School, and the other children are fol
lowing in her footsteps Just as fast, as
they can; even the baby, a mischievous
boy of. 5 years, Is struggling with his
letters and making all manner of pot
hooks and queer-looking things that he
proudly calls "println'."
Another little man. the pet of the
home, dimples and talks. in a language
all his own, and if he misses his father
and mother we are not aware of it.
"Baby Carl," as he Is called. Is a full
orphan, but he has more than a dozen
wee mothers who do their very best to
spoil him and to make up to him the
loss of those nearest and dearest.
Baby Carl never knew his mother or
her loving care, for as his life dawned
hers went but, and the boy's father
was left with a soul to make or mar.
For seventeen long months he watched
over his tiny son and saw him grow
more and more like his mother, and at
the end of that time he went to her to
give an account of his . stewardship.
Being an Odd Fellow, his last hours
were easy, for he had been promised,
that the lodge would give the baby the
best of care and that he would be
taught to be a strong, self-reliant man,
whose duty In life would be tp protect
and help those weaker and more un
fortunate than himself.
And so the story goes* on. Each and
every tot's life has been touched with
sorrows, some more and some less, but
w'ith trials and tribulations far too
heavy for baby hands to struggle with,
and it 1* to lessen these difficulties that
the Rebekahs have opened, not only
their doors, but their hearts as well, to
all who are less fortunate than them
selves.
R!n* out. O bells, with glad .retrain;
What blessed task to us Is riven.
To rear a temple la his nasje
And show to earth the law of Heaven.
May this our home, forever stand
Through winter's blast and summer's son.
Proclaiming hence, throughout the land.
Love's holy mission here began.
And may at least the- earth redeem**.
And every tear of sorrow dry.
The light that through our home haa streamed
Stuns on targujJi. all eternity.
Y""TT VERY home In the nature of an
-/ orphan asylum is bound to be
( f permeated with pathetic stories
--. \w and sad lives and while the Re
bekah Home has had its share of
troubles and woes, it has likewise had
its full share of blessings. The law of
nature heals wounds quicker with chil
dren than It does with grown folks,
so there is scarcely ever a time when
our little ones have other than a smil
ing face for long.
In the beginning the home had a par
ticularly sad family that it opened
I wide its arms to receive and I am go
ing to tell you about It, as I think there
are few, if any, protective homes that
would shelter and care for a family of
eight helpless little children.
Full five years ago there lived in
Solano County a happy family whose
time and life were spent out of doors,
working and playing in an orchard and
making of life one great joyous holi
day. Day after day passed and at the
close of the evening, when the seven
children were tucked safely away in
their beds and had gone happily to
.dreamland, the father and mother used
to} sit down and count themselves
among the blessed.
But somehow or other such complete
happiness seems to be of short dura
tion, for there is seldom a case that
is not marred or robbed of its price
less possession. One afternoon Mrs.
Newport, for such was her name, heard
a familiar step on the porch and went
out to see the meaning of it, for there
was a large shipment of dried fruits
on hand and she knew that unless
something had gone seriously wrong
. he would not be coming home In the
middle of the day with such weary,
dragging steps.
That was the beginning of their
troubles. Perhaps top much work, per
j haps too much handling of fruit, or
perhaps just a rundown condition;
â¢ but whatever the cause, , the fact re
mained just the same, that before night
B. P. Newport was a seriously ill man,
with symptoms that pointed strongly
x the typhoid way.
Taking care of a sick man and see-
Ing that seven children, all under
eleven years of age,- were clothed and
fed, and trying to attend to the or
chard, would have been a most diffi
cult task for any woman that possess
ed boundless strength and energyâ
which Mrs. Newport did not, so that
when her little one came she had
neither the physical endurance or vi
tality to rally. Slowly but surely she
grew weaker and the thought that her
husband Â¦ was lying seriously ill anÂ»
perhaps ' in a dying condition almost
I drove her frantic. What could her lit
tle ones do If they were left alone?
Not one of them was old enough to
realize the loss, let alone struggle
with the stern proposition of winning
Vead and butter. .
Tortured and worried with anxiety,
unable to leave her bed and go to thÂ«
man who' cried aloud, for her to com*
to him In his delirium, and constantly
' - begged by little voices and pulled by
baby hands. Is it any wonder that her
â¢ strength ; failed her altogether, so tha*.
Just three, weeks after the arrival of
â¢the tiny stranger that she had looked
forward to with so much pleasure, she
slipped ., put . Into the unknown and
found Â¦ the^ peace ' and quiet that she
had so longed for?
Certainly this affliction should have
been enough, for It, would have been
.difficult enough for a father to carp
minute before. It was a good thing
that the front portion was flimsy, for
every one forgot all about -the door in
the grand rush to get outside, for the
bull, on recovering his feet, gave one
snort and started for the outside, and
whether he was blinded by dirt or
merely wanted revenge we didn't know,
but at any rate as he came out he
k::uvl:ed down the ridge pole support
and the whole roof of our lodge room
caved in."
This story, which is perhaps familiar
to all Odd, Fellows, serves to show how
interested members have always been
in fhe order and what hardships they
were willing to undergo to keep it up,
and no matter where you may go you
will find the same indomitable spirit
in both lodges, so it is no wonder that
they have gained in strength and pow
er every day. Bare facts are not always
interesting, but , they, are wonderfully
good when it comes to 'a mere matter
of proof and : when I tell ".you- that
twenty-one years after the first lodge
was . Instituted j there ; were ' 147 with a
membership of 10,404, I think you will
agree with me that the Rebekahs had
pressed gallantly forward in the fra
ternal field and that the results were
most gratifying'.
Just about this time we began to
feel that a State convention would ac
complish a great deal for uÂ», for by
banding together we could , formulate
and carry out plans that we had been
considering for some time, so accord
ingly in 1891 we held a convention in
California that really marked a, new
era in . Rebekah Odd^FeUowshlp.
It was not until the second -session'
of the convention, a year later, that any
movement wag made toward establish-
THE
WORK OF THE HOME
By Matron Olive T. Allen
of this band of women, whose aim in
lifÂ» is to relieve the trials and lessen
the responsibilities of life.
One cannot estimate deeds of charity
and human sympathy in so many dol
lars and cents, for deeds of kindness
and benevolence are far more precious
than gold or silver, b*ut when I tell you
that in 'he year 1897 the Rebekahs of
the Grand Jurisdiction of America paid
out over 151,000 for the relief of their
sick and aged you will see that they
have not been idle. In fact, so faith
fully havQ the Rebekahs carried out all
work that has come to their hands
that they have been granted higher
privileges year after year until their
crowning glory came from the Odd Fel
lows themselves when they admitted
that the "Rebekahs are a necessity."
The pioneer lodge on this coast was
instituted June 30, 1870, and was called
California Rebekah Lodge No. L "While
there were a hosted difficulties and they
worked under all sorts and conditions
of disadvantages I do not think they
had as strenuous a time as did the Odd
Fellows. I want you to thoroughly un
derstand and appreciate the spirit of
determination and grit that permeates
the fellowship, and eo I am going to
deviate a little and give you some lit
tle idea of what the early Odd Fellows
had to contend with. According to
Myron C. Close, one of the early broth
ers in California, the first lodgcroom
was situated over a . saloon that was
frequented by the cowboys when they
were in town. "One of our enterpris
ing brothers painted .on the gable end
of the hall, fronting on the main street,
I. O. O. F. Hall, and underneath the
three links, but our artist brother soon
found out that he had made a blunder,
for ere many weeks the gable end look
ed like a perforated chair bottom.
"About this time we came to the con.
elusion if we wanted much of an at
tendance lodge night we must encase
the upper story in boiler iron or vacate,
for one thickness of cottonwood boards
betwen us and those frolicsome cowboys
was insufficient. On the opposite side
of the river was a roomy dugout that
had been used the season before as a
dance hall, and after some little dis
cussion we secured that and congrat
ulated ourselves in not being obliged
to dodge stray bullets any more.
"This dugout, by the way, was made
in an old river bottom, for above the
first bottom was a second one some
fifteen feet higher on the level with
the prairie beyond. Into this bank an
excavation had been made twenty feet
wide and forty deep, leaving three skies
soil and an opening in front which was
boarded up with odds and ends of lum
ber, stray boxes and an end board of an
old Government wagon. An opening of
three feet aquare covered with thin
muslin varnished formed a window, and
as a support for the ridge poles three
cottonwood posts were set in the ground
at each end and center, then cotton
wood poles laid cloaely together, and
over this the earth- with the prairie
grass growing wildly, so that coming
off the prairie one would never know
that there was an abode there.
"So much for a description of a dugout
and the Odd Fellows' Hall combined.
Our second meting was an initiation
and our conductor had Just said "be
hold,' when a scene not generally used
was presented to every brother's view
âa falling of dirt; from overhead, a
cracking of poles, a roar. and* a bellow
in one, and a huge buffalo landed on
his head where both" the candidate and
the conductor had been^ standing the

\Â» toward exile, has woman beep
the inseparable companion and com
rade to man; strong and self
reliant in herself, but achieving the
greatest and noblest that is in her only
when her work is supplemental to
man's. Man is the aggressor; but in
order fi>r the greatest good to result to
mankind through the relationship of
men and women, his dominant, re
sourceful energy must receive the en
couragement of her gentle sympathy
and hercic self-sacrifice.
It is these lest named virtues are the
fundamental principles of Odd Fellow
s-hip and it 5s strange that woman's
work as a necessary adjunct was not
recognized many years earlier than it
was. But all good things come Elowly,
and then, as a consequence, are more
lasting. During the last fifty years
several sn called innovations have been
made, and 1 am sure that the ladies
are not entirely alone in thinking that
the creation of the Rebekah and mili
tary branches have been the most val
uable addition in the way of extending
the good work of Odd Fellowship.
It is to Schuyltr Colfax that the Re
bekahs owe their being, for he really
was the founder and author of the
beautiful degree by which womn were
brought into fellowship by the Order
of Odd Fellows. As ily as 1551. a
New York representative named Smith
presented the following resolution at
a session of the Grand Lodge of the
United States:
"Resolved, That a special committee
of three members be appointed to pre
pare an appropriate honorary degree
â¢with accompanying sign or signs and
passv.ord. c , to be conferred upon the
â¢wives of Scarlet Degree members who
are in good standing in the order, and
th&X raid committee report such degree
for conpideration at the next commu
nication of the Grand Lodge."
This report was adopted in September.
lÂ£50, and three representativesâCol
fax cf Indiana, Martin of Mississippi
and Eteele of Tennessee â were chosen
as a epecial committee, and so well did
they perform their duty that at the
Â¦ession of the Grand Lodge held In the
city of Baltimore in September, 1S31,
they presented a complete ritual for the
new degree, which was promptly called
the degre of Rebekah. This report, by
the vay, was adopted by the Grand
Lodge In secret session September 20,
1EEL
Those -who understand anything of
lefige services can easily comprehend
the immensity of the task of these three
men. and while Mr. Colfax's co-work
ers doubtless did all they could to as
eist him in preparing this work, they
declare that both the language and the
construction cf the ritual belong to
Colfax exclusively, and long since the
Â¦world ha* admitted that he certainly
tad a very full recognition of woman's
adaptability in this line of work, for
since 1E51 they have been regarded as
an instrument that has achieved great
good.
And let me tell you that Mr. Colfax
did cot have a path etrewn with roses,
cor did he meet with assistance on all
tides. Instead, he fought every Inch
of ground. Men, as a rule, do not care
especially for changes or Innovations,
nor do they particularly fancy sharing
their pet secrets with woman, so the
obstacles that confronted Rebekahiem
teemed, for a time, almost Insurmount
able. But where there Is a will there
is a way, and 6o it chanced that the
Rebekah degree of Odd Fellowship was
authorized on the 20th day of Septem
ber, 185L
At that time this degree was merely
a complimentary one and an extremely
doubtful experiment at that, but to
day It stands aÂ« an absolute certainty
and a great success. Yet to reach this
plane has taken years of patient labor
and of thoughtful sympathy, but it was
all well worth the while, for there is
scarcely a quarter cf the globe that
has not felt the charity and kindness
And so it is with the Rebekahs, ever
.sweeping onward with, the progress of
civilization and standing under the ban
ner which is the symbol for Truth,
Humanity and Friendship.
This home is really the center and
the heart of Rebekahlsm. The Odd Fel
lows maintain their home for the poor
and reedy, but It is our pleasure to
care for the helpless and to shelter
those who should claim the sympathy
of every man and woman in the land
tiny tots who cannot care for them
selves and who, by an unfortunate turn
of the wheel of fate, have no one to do
It for them.
ing our orphans' home, and then It
was In the form of the following reso
lution:
"Resolved. That the convention of the
Daughters of Rebekah, I. O. O. F.. of
California, start a fund that shall be
known as the Odd Fellows' Orphans'
Home Fund of California."
This occasioned the setting aside of
moneys at various times, both by lodges
and interested Individuals, but it was
not until after 1835, when the State
convention resolved itseir into the Re
bekah Assembly, that we really peti
tioned for and received authority to
establish such a home in our State.

ELBERT R: DILLE,.;PAST, GRAND CHArLAIN, GRAND LODGE. OF CALIFORNIA.
r T"* he following: table shows the State or Tcr
1 ritory, number of lodges, membership and
net sain in membership of the lodges un
der the jurisdiction of the Sovereign Grand
lx>dge, according; to the latest official figures:
Membership by States.
have ~C2 subordinate lodges, with Zo,-
GSG members: 9j encampments," 6i00
members; 2S2 Rebekah degree Ipdges,';.
with 24,000 members; and while CaH
fornia has only one-twenty-eighth* of
the membership of American Odd Fel
lowship, it pays one-twelfth of the re
lief, disbursed.
The chief objects of Odd Fellowship
then are to promote brotherhood and"
fraternity cniong men; to establish
Upon 'â¢the mutual plan a fund for the
relief in sickness and disability '. of
members ami their families and the
widows and orphans of deceased mem-,
bers; to assist the spirit of co-opera
tion in -all departments of labor and
commerce; to aid the unfortunate and
rotieva' the distressed. Could â¢ our -
founder. Wildey. revisit, the earth, his
great heart ' as large as humanity
would throb With joy to see the little'
one become not .1000 merely but more
than a million in membership and to
knov,- that, last year it disbursed four
millions of dollars in relief and to
know that that princely sum is but. a
tithe of its munificence. Â£
]iut t)dd Fellowship Is not a cross
between a life insurance company and
an undertaking establishment. A man
does not join it because he is going to
die. but because he wants to live
longer and â¢ more happily. And it is
an undeniable fact that a. man will,
live happier and longer who has made
provision for sickness and disability.
From the day an honest man takes the
first degree in Odd Fellowship and
gets his first receipt for dues, it gives
a new impulse to his arm, a new light
to his eye. a new hope to his heart, as
well as kindling a lamp in his home
that will lighten it when sickness in
vades it and that will even chase away
some of the gloom when the little fam
ily comes backÂ« from the grave they
have bedewed with their tears.
The truth is this organization haÂ»
army.
There are two classes of these order3
âthe purely fraternal orders and thÂ«s
life beneficiary orders. The former
represent a. membership of 3,010,000. the
latter a membership of 3,020,000. n total
of G.OCO.CDO. These various societies paid
out as benefits last year in round num
bers $75,000,000. One hundred and two
of these societies have paid in the last
thirty years S570.oU3.5Sl.
Last year the fraternal societies of
America raid in benefits $30,030,000
more than the Standard Oil Company
pays to all its employes â and "it pays
5'5.0C0.0OO.
The influence and benefit of ihis vast
amount can best be appreciated if we
divide it into two parts. Let us say
that J50.0C0.OO0 was paid in death bene
fits and $15,000,000 as weekly benefits.
The former ct $2000 a policy would
mean 25,000 families pla-.ed for a time
at least above the fear of want; the
latter would mean 1150,000 families re
ceiving $10 a. week fur ten weeks of the
j ear, and that means aid in tiding over
a crisis and the keeping of actual want
from the door.
Take Odd Fellowship alone. It has
H.000 subordinate lodges, with 1,070.000
members: 2SÂ»00 encampments, with 156,
000 members; 6100 Rebekah degree
lodges with 450.000 members; and 1S,
000 Patriarchs Militant.
It has disbursed in relief in its nearly
eighty-six years of life $100,000,000, and
it has invested funds amounting to
$32,000,000, and* gives relief annually to
the extent of $4,000,000.
In our own California jurisdiction we
OKE ot the chief results of the
social revolution which has
made the spirit of human
brotherhood dominant in this
KÂ£e is the development of the great
fraternal organizations. There are 21^
fraternal orders, with 6.000.000 mem
bers, in this land and the white ban
ner of Odd Fellowship loads this vast
solved ' the problemâ the great prob
lem of to-dayâ how shall a community
be * so 'organized i arid constituted that
none of its members \ shall be bbjects
of charity, either public or privateâ
that not one of them shall be a burden
on society. .-. ;U â¢
Tner'e are no -paupers in this order;
.you never saw. a menvoer of this or
ganization marching in a procession
clamoring for j bread or. work. There
never was an Odd . Feljow enrolled in
Coxey's Industrial Army nor In the
Ancient and Honorably-. Order of . the
Sons of Rest â the tramp'.brigade.
You never knew one of.t,hem to join
a mob to invade the rights of .proper
ty, nor a combination to take away
the rights of labor. â¢ You never knew
one of them thrown upon the cold
:"Â¦ charities ot a friendless world. If an
Odd Fellow is in trouble he is aided,
not by a grudging charity dispensed to
a man as you, would throw a bone to a
.dog, but as a dividend rightfully be
longing to him.. "
The principles of this order should
be incorporated into the body politic
and into society at large; for if the
â¢principles of mutual helpfulness em
bodied in Odd Fellowship should be
come the law of society,' penury and
want would be done' away with. . Then
the poor would no longer envy the
rich, nor \ the rich ! despise the poor,
and the golden rifle which lies at the
. foundation of this order would replace
.the rule of God. r As "William Penn .de
clared long ago, fraternity would be
the best remedy for all our social' ills.
But. this order is something more
than a mere beneficial society. That
is after all only the lower, the material
side' of It. That is its body, so to
> speak;- to "find its soul, its spirit, you
but must look into it deeper; you must
study it more profoundly. / i
Â¦ An order which teaches equal and
exact justice to all men, an order that
inculcates equal fll eivll and political
rights, an order ti&i teaches fraternity
-among men and fa*Ith in God, is a so
cial force, 'ji uplifting force, a civiliz
ing force, a character-building force.
a great cohesive force to hold society;
and the nation together and to
strengthen the bonds of , human
brotherhood the world around.
It is a . character-makins force. It
brings a young man before its altars
and puts upon his lips the most tre
mendous vows of upright living and
holy service; he professes' there by ev
ery sacred symbol and solemn cere
mony that he will be a good Odd Fel
low, and therefore that he will be true
to his noblest self, faithful to his fam
ily, loyal to his country, fraternal to
his fellowmen and reverent and obedi
ent to his God. 5 : "' t
Teaching loyalty to established gov
ernment and obedience to law eur or
der is one of the strongest bonds of our
nation's life.
It was the three links that helped to
heal the wounds of war and to make
real that vision of a reunited people
that suffused Grant's last, hours with
p*eace and smoothed his pathway to the
grave. You remember how the Grand
Lodge of the United States in 1863
solved the problem of reconstruction.
The Grand Sire at the clos* of hostili
ties issued a proclamation declaring
the unbroken unity of the order, and
at the session of 1S65 delegates from
Northern and Southern jurisdictions
took their seats together in the Grand
Lodge. Bishop Hopkins of the Protes
tant E$isccpal church advised his
broken denomination rent in twain by
the war to "go to Baltimore and imi
tate the example of the Odd Fellows."
Thank God. the three links have never
rusted in. time of peace nor melted in
the flames of war!
Brothers, our work is not done!
While tears are shed by the widows
Â¦and the fatherless, while there is strife
and intolerance and want and woe in
the world, we may not forsake our
standards. The gates of a new century
have Just shut behirfc} us and we must
lift our flag to loftier heights and dedi
cate our great order anew to the high
purposes which gave it birth.

Hodge; I. O. O.^F.'.vAt the time of this
first ; gathering of any fraternal society,
September, I860, 4 pur order had a mem
b'frfihjpof io,766rand 154 lodges.
'; The : second .meeting of this Grand
body; 'in 'this State was held in Los
Angeles, September. 3&S3. Southern
California, which at the date of the ses
sion, of 186D, was : considered to be at
least -two-thirds idesert, and in which
at "that time there were but four lodges,
had '; become tha^ most famous portion
of the State andr*thp "rttv of . thÂ«Â» Kxx-
gels," In 1S69 but a small Spanish mis
sion, was now a .city of 60,000 busy,
bustling people. â¢
By 1888 trips across the continent had
lost the charm" of novelty and conven
tions of all kinds and classes had be
come common. Our order in the mean
time had continued Its onward prog
ress and now numbered 327 lodges tind
26,457 members, and the southern part
of the State had been dotted with nu
merous lodges in which the good seed
of Odd Fellowship was being continu
ally sowed, the harvest showing an
abundant yield > .
Now, at this time, the third assem
bling in our State of the governing
head of four organizations, we have a
membership . of 26,239, enrolled in 366
lodges^; :f',\- t
California has had on its rolls many
who have gained fraternal and national
recognition and who have honored our
jurisdiction. Among these deserving of
mention is Samuel H. Parker, our first
grand master, to whose energetic
faithful work much 'of the early pros
perity of the order is to De attributed.
Recognizing the influence for good of
libraries',, lie founded the Odd Fellows'
jL4brary of 1 San Francisco, which , for.
jbuiny: years retained ".its'; prominence as
(oj^e ot; the leadlngClIbrarieB ,pf this city,

Brother Mume, under a commission
â¢ from the grand sire, instituted the
â¢ Grand Lodges of Germany and- Swit
zerland; and under .many difficulties,
I it being at'the'lime of the Franco
â¢ Prussian, war, and; for his .services re-
â¢ ceived the thanks of the ; Sovereign
â¢ Grand Lodge and a special gift from
- the Grand Lodge of Germany.
I ' John B. Harmon, past grand master
: of this State, was elected to the po
' sition of grand sire of . the Sovereign '
| Grand Lodge. .While serving as depu
Â¦ ty grand sire he was tent to Australia
on a mission of peace, it being to har
monise differences that* had arisen be
twen Australia and New Zealand,
which mission was most satisfactorily
'. performed.
The Home â Another great work wÂ©
as Odd Fellows have performed is the
building and supporting at Thermali to,
Butte County, a home for our aged
and indigent brothers and sisters, and
under whose hospitable roof 111 of
these, our guests, are receiving the lov
ing cure of the "Brothers of the Triple
Link" at an annual cost to each mem
ber of the jurisdiction of CO cents.
Home for orphansâ No work of this
kind: would be complete were not, the
'children of .our; deceased members; cared
for,- and Â¦ this gloving, 'mission; has-; been
' nobly -taken" Up,-' and Â¦Â« an '-'orphans*
home, located at Gllroy, Santa Clara
County, are now some fifty of these
who, deprived by providence of . their
natural protectors, are receiving the
'loving ministrations of those sisters
; who at the altars of Rebekah Odd Fel
lowship have been taught the divine
lessons of love. This institution has
'been under the exclusive management
of .i board of five trustees (ladies),
elected by the Rebekah Assembly, and
the Orphans' Home is a credit to th$
hearts and heads of our Rebekah sla
ters.
From the small, beginnings' herÂ©

there are young clerks out of place,

is very much the name, only most peo

Yesterday they all talked at once,
eoroehow poor people always do, and
so I caught up my hat, and went out
for a stroIL "Two governesses offered
to accompany me, but I said I had to
write a speech, and so I went out by
myself. I found myself after a bit In
a wood â all green, all moss, and over
head scarcely any light. Suddenly
down a ride there came a figure In
white. The figure approached me, and
I saw a pretty face and real golden
hairâ no dye. and pal* blue eyes, and
a baby mouth. As the lady passed me
she let drop a book. I ran forward
and picked It up. What was my sur
prise, cot to find a novel or a poem,
but a medical treatise. I gave it to
her and she smiled and passed on. She
was a pretty plcttye, and really looked
very intelligent.

Anna, notwithstanding: her quiet
clothes, a figure marvellously out of
accord with her surroundings, sat be
fore a small marble-topped' table at
a crowded ABC, and munched a roll
and butter with hearty appetite.
"If only I could afford another!" she
thought â¢ regretfully. "I wonder why
I am always hungry nowadays, âit ' is
so ridiculous.". : - Â¦
Bhe lingered over her tea, and glanc

change In her surroundings from the
scene of her last night's supper brought
a faint, humorous smile to her lips.
Her eyes brightened. . She had to stifle
a laugh. A harmless young city clerk,
who had been watching her for the
last half an hour in rapt admiration,
accepted it for encouragement, and
ventured upon a' preliminary cough. A
moment later he passed through the
swinging doors' with scarlet cheeks.

pavement outside ", her teeth "were
clenched, and she . carried herself un
consciously an inch or ,ao higher.\ It
was just then that she came face to
face with. Nigel Ennison.
He was walking listlessly along, well
dressed, debonnair, good looking.;, Di
rectly he saw Anna he. accosted - her.
His manner was deferential, ;even
eager. Anna,' who was disposed to be
sharply critical, could find, no fault

\ "I .may come a little way, then?"
he* begged.
"If you think .It worth while," she
answered doubtfully.
Apparently he thought it very much
worth while. Restraining with an ef
fort his intense curiosity, he talked of
general subjects only, trying his best to
entertain her. He succeeded so well
that they were almost In Montague
street before Anna stopped short.
- Â» "Heavens!" she exclaimed. ' "I have
brought 'you -Very nearly to my door.
Go back at once, please.
He held out his hand obediently.
"I'll go," /he said/ "but I warn you
that I shall find you out.".
For a moment she was grave.
"Well," she said, "I may be leaving
where; I am In a few days, so very
likely you will be no better off."
He looked at her Intently.
**Miss Pellissicr," said, "I don't un
derstand this change in you. Every
word you utter puzzles me. I have an
idea that you are in some sort of
trouble. - Won't you let me â can't I be
of any assistance?"
He was . obviouslv in earnest. His
tone was kind and sympathetic.
"You are very good," she said. "In
deed I shall not forget your offer. But
just now. there Is nothing which you or
anybody can do. Good-by."
' . He' was dismissed, and he understood
It. Anna crossed the street, and letting
herself in at No. 13 . with a latchkey

couitlaw, hnggard, his deep-set eyes
mice Liill:ant than ever, took Anna's
haim Into n.s and breathed a little
c.c^e-Ciuwn Eigh of content. He was
ir.uoduced to lirendon and a chair was
b)ou fc ht by au attentive waiter. He
utrtuntd supper, but took wine.
"iiii.ve you dropped from the fkies?"
tjjui.ey Â«6Kt.:Â« wonderingly. "It was

"1 bad i jme unexpected business."
Courttaw answered shortly.
â¢ And bow did you find us here?"
"l cnlitd at Montague street a few
minutes alter you had left. Mrs. White
toiu me where to find you."
He leaned back in his chair as though
wearied. Yet either the rest or the wine
seemed already to have done him good.
The lines about his mouth gradually
soitcncd. J-ie talked very little and
rather absently. In no way could be
be said ty contribute to the gayety of
the little party. But when they were
on their way out he whispered in
Anna's ear:
"Mease let me drive you home. I
want to talk to you, and I must icturn
to-morrow."
Anna hesitated.
"We are Mr. Brendon's guests." she
said, "and I scarcely think it would be
nice of me to leave him alone with
Sydney." , :
Courtlaw turned abruptly to Bren
don.
"Mr. Brendon." he said, "may I rob
you of your guest Just for the drive
home? I have only a few hours in
England, and Miss Pellissier is an old
friend."
"By all means." Brendon answered.
â¢'We will follow you in another cab."
They passed out on to the pavement,
ar.d the commissionaire called a han
som, "me man looked closely at Anna
as she crossed the footway, and as he
held her skirt from the wheel he press
ed something into* her hand. Her fin
gers closed upon It instinctively. It was
a letter. She .slipped it calmly into her
pocket. The commissionaire smiled. It
was a sovereign easily earned.
The hansom drove off. Suddely Anna
felt her hand seized and Imprisoned in
Courtlaw's burning fingers. She
glanced into his face. It was enough.
"I have stood It for a month, Anna,"
he exclaimed. "You will not even an
swer my letters. I could not keep away
any longer."
"Do you think that it was wise of
you, or kind to come?" she asked qui
etly.
"Wise! Kind! What mockery words
are! I came because I had to. I can
not live without you. Anna. Come back
âyou muet come back. We can be
married to-morrow in Paris. There!
You are trying to take your hand
away."
"You disappoint me." she said wear
ily. "You are talking like a boy. What
is the use of it? I do not wish to mar
ry you. I do not wleh to return to
Paris. You are doing your beat to
break our friendship."
-,."It Is you," he cried, "you, who are
talking folly, when you speak of
friendship between you and me. It Is
not the woman who speaks there. It is
the vaporing schoolgirl. I tell you that
I love you, Anna, and I believe that
you love me. You are necessary to
me. I shall give you my life, every
moment and thought of my life. You
must come back. See what you have
made of me. I cannot work. I cannot
teach. You have grown Into my life
and I cannot tear yon out."
Anna was silent. She was trembling
a little. The man's passion was In
fectious. She had to school herself
to speak the words -which she knew
would cut him like a -knife.
"You are mistaken, David. I hare
counted you, and always hoped to
count you, the best of my friends. But
I flo not love youâ I do not love any
one.** JSKB

hoarsely. "We have com* too cIom to

-"We are nor going the 'right way!"
the exclaimed.
"You arc coming my way," Court
law answered. "Anna," he pleaded,
"be merciful. You care for me just a
little. I know. You aie alc-ne in the

to consider. Come back with me to

the chill loneliness of it all nearly sent

Anna lifted her hand and *pushed
cpan the trap door.
"Drive to 13 Montague street. Cab
man." she ordered.
The man pulled up his horse, grum
bling, and turned around. Courtlaw
sat with folded arme. He said noth
ing.
"My friend," she said, "no! Let me
tell you this: Nothing would induce
me to many you, cr any man at pres^
ent. I am a pauper, and as yet I
have not discovered how to earn
money. I am determined lo light my
own battle with the world. There
must be a place for me somewhere,
and I mean to find it. Afterward it
may be different. If I were to marry
you now I shouid feel a dependent be
ing all my lifeâ a sort of parasitical
creature without blood or muscle. I
should lose every scrap of Independ
enceâeven my self-respect. However
good you were to me and however
happy I was in other ways I should
find this intolerable."
"All these things." he muttered bit
terly, "this desperate resolve to take
your life into your own hands, your
unnatural craving for, Independence,
would never trouble you for a moment
âif you really cared."
"Then perhaps," she answered, with
a new coldness In her tone, "perhaps
I really do not care. No. don't Inter
rupt me. I think that I am a little
disappointed in you. You appear to
be among those strong enough In all
ordinary matters, but who seem to
think it quite natural and proper to
give in at once and play the weakling
directly â one cares. Do youthlnk that
it makes for happiness to force oneself
into the extravagant belief that
love is the only thing in the world
worth having, and to sacrifice for it
independence, self-respect, one's whole
scheme of life? I cannot do it, David.
Perhaps, as you say, I do not really,
careâ but I cannot do it."
He was strangely silent. He did not
even reply to her for several minutes.
"I cannot reason with you," he Baid
at last, wearily. "I speak from my
heart, and you answer from ' your
brain." .â¢Â¦ Â¦Â¦.*!*.".â¢* ":-<w.:Â» * ./- A v-- =
"Believe me that I have answered
you wisely." she said. In a gentler tone,
"wisely for you too. as well as myself.
And now you must go back, take up

Presently you will see that I am right,
and then you shall take your vacation
over here, and we will be good com
rades aerain."
He smiied bitterly as he handed her
from the cab. He declined to come in.
"Will you tell Sydney that I will see
him in the morning?" hfÂ» said, f'T am
staying at the Savoy. He came round
there." ?
"You will shake hands with me,

He took her lingers and lifted his
eyes to hers. Something he saw there

She was able to go straight to her
room without delay., and she at once
locked the door with a little sigh of re
lief. She found. herself struggling with
a storm of tears. â¢
A sob was strangled In her throat.
She struggled fiercely not tp give way.

To escape from her thoughts she be

which tlfe commissionaire. at the Carl

CIIAPTKU XIII.
The Puzzlement of Nigel Eunlsoc
Nigel "Ennison walked . toward hi3
club the most puzzled man in London.
There .could 'not, he decided, possibly
be two girls so much alike. Uesidcj.
she had admitted- her identity. And
yetâ -he thought vÂ£ the^supper party
where he had met Annabel PtMlissier.
the stories about her,. his own few min
utes' whispered love-making! Hr \va.s a,
fclf-containtd young man., but h:j
cheeks grew hot at the thought- of th..>
things which it had seemed cmlte.nat
ural to scy toh^r then, but which he
knew very well would have been in
stantly resented by thegiil whom hs
had just left. He went over hsr fea
tures one by. one irr* his mind. ,â¢ They
Â¦were the same. He could, not Â° deulit
it. There was the same, airyjerracp <>Â£
movement, the same deep-brown hair
and alabaster skin. He four.d himstif
thinking- up all the psychology which
he had ever read. Was this the. rfsuit
of some strange experiment? It was
the person of Annabel Pellisslerâ the
soul of a very different ordir of belna.
He spent the remainder of the, after
noon looking: for a. friend whom h*
found at last in the billiard-room of
one of the smaller clubs to which he
belonged. After the usual laconic greet
ings, he drew him on one side.
"Fred." he said,^ "do- you remember
taking me to dinner at the Embassa
dor's one evening last* September to
meet a girl .who was slnsins /there?
Hamilton and Drummond and his lot
were with us." ' t'A.'Z â¢
"Of course." his friends answered.
"La belle Alc'de. wasn't it. Annabel
Pelllssier was her 'real name. Jolly nice
girl, too."
Ennison nodded.
"I thought I saw her In" town" to
day," he said.' "Do you happen to
know whether she Is supposed to bo
here?" """â¢ ' Â¦ â¢
"Very likely indeed." Caoiain Fred
Meddoes answered, lighting a cigarette.
"I heard that she had chucked" her
Bhow at the French places and erona
in for a reform all round. Sister's got
married to that bounder Ferringhall."
Ennison took an. easy chair.
"What a little brick!" he murmured.
"She must have character! , It's no
half reform either. What do you know
about her. Fred? I am Interested."
Meddoes turned round from the table
on which he was practicing shots and
shrugged his shoulders.
"Not much." he answered, "and vet
about all there Is to be known. I fancv.
There were twÂ» sisters, you know. Old
Jersey and Hampshire family, the Pel-
Ilssiera, and a capital stock, too. I be
lieve."
"Any one could see that the cirls
were . ladies," Ennison murmured.
"No doubt about that." Meddoes con
tinued. '"The father was in the armv
and got a half-pay Job at St. Hellers.
Died short. I suppose, and the eirls had
to shift for themselves. One went in for
painting,,kept straight and married old
Ferringhall a week or so ago â the
Lord help her. The other kicked over
the traces a bit. made rather a hit
with her singing at some of thos.?
French places, and went the pace in Â»
mild, lady-like sort of way. Cheveney
was looking after her, I think, then.
If she's over, he probably knows all
about it."
Ennison looked' steadily at ' the
cigarette which he was tapping on his
forefinger.
"So Cheveney was her friend, you
think, eh?" he remarked.
"No doubt about that, I fancy."
Â¦.Meddoes answered lightly. . "He ran
some Austrian fellow off. She |va<i

" and eyes, and a style about her, too.
Care for a hundred up?"
Ennison shook his head.
"Can't stop, thanks," he answered.
"See you to-night, I suppose?"- :.
" He sauntered off.
"I'm damned if I'll believe it," he
muttered to himself savagely. -
But for the next few days- he avoid
ed Cheveney like the plague..
The same night he met Meddoes and
Drummond together, the latter, over
from Paris on a week's leave from the
embassy.
"Odd thing." Meddoes remarked,
"we were Just talking about the Pellls
sier girl. Durmmond was telling me
about the way old Ferringhall rounded
upon them all at the club." ' Â¦
"Sounds interesting," Ennison re
marked. "May I hear?"
"It really isn't much to tell," Drum
mend answered. "You know what a
fearful old prig Ferringhall is. always
gees about as though the whole world
was watching him? We tried to show
him around Paris, but he wouldn't
have any of It. Talked about his years,
his position and his constituents, and
always sneaked off back to his hotel
just when the fun was going to be
gin. Well, one night some of us saw
him, or thought we saw him, at a cafe
dining with 'Alcide* â as a matter of
nrct, it seems that it. was -her sister.
He came Into the club the next day.
and, of course, we went for him thick.
Jove, he didn't take to It kindly, I can
tell you. Stood on his dignity and
shut us up in great style. It seems
that he was a sort of family friend of
the Pelllsslers, and it was the artist
sister whom he was with. The Joke
of it Is that he's married to her now
and cuts me dead."
"I suppose," Ennison said. -. "the
likeness between the sisters must ba
rather exceptional?"
"I never saw tha goody-goody one
close to, so I can't say," Drummond
answered. "Certainly I was a. little
way off at the cafe, and she had a hat
and veil on, but I could have. sworn
that It was 'Alcide.* "
. "Is 'Alcide' still In Paris?" Ennison
asked.
"Don't think so," Drummond an
swered. "I heard the other day that
she'd been taken In by some cad of a
fellow who was cutting a great dash
In .Paris personating Meysey Hill,
the great railway man. Anyhow,
she's disappeared for .some reason
or other. Perhaps Ferringhall has pen
sioned her off. He's the sort of Johnny
who wouldn't care about having a sis
ter-in-law on the loose."
' "Ennison here thought he saw her in
London," Meddoes remarked. â¢'*' â¢
Drummond nodded. ;; '->
"Very likely. The two sisters were
very fond of one another, I believe.
Perhaps Sir John is going to take the
other one under bis wing. Who's for
a rubber of whist?" Â¦ â¢
Ennison made so many mistakes that
he was glad to cut out early in the
evening. He walked across the park
and called upon his sister.
"Is Lady Lascelles in?" he asked th
butler.
"Her Ladyship dined at hom*." the
man answered. "I have Just ordered a
carriage for her. I believe -that her
Ladyship Is going to Carey House, and
on to the Marquis of Waterford's
ball," he added, hastily consulting a
diary on the hall -table. .-. .
A tall, elegantly dressed woman, fol
lowed by a maid, came down the broad
staircase. . .
"Is that you. Nigel? 1 * she asked, vi
hope you are going to Carey House "
: He. shook: his head, and threw open
the door of a grea? dim-lit coau^eir
on thÂ« crourcl floor

"You and all the rest.cf them are al

.She assented, smiling. -He Was her
only brother, and she was his favorite
sister. He- closed the door.
\"I want to ask you a question" he
said. "A serious question." Â¦
She stopped buttoning her glove, and

He' was silent for a "moment, or two.
His lips were tight drawn. His eyes

"Do you think it is kind of you,
Miss Pellissier," he. said, ; almost
roughly, "to ' ignore . yolir. friends so ?
In your, heart you - know quite Â¦ well
that you could pay Sydney or me no

'Breridbn told him the name of a dis

Something seemed .to catch his

less; and disappointed silence. If he
had only known ' it,* 1 sympathy was al-
Then he met the fixed, breathless
gaze of those wonderful eyes from the
other side of the table, and he, too,
broke off in the middle of his sentence.
He breathed heavily, as though he had
been running. His large, coarse lips
drew wider apart. Slowly a mirthless
and very unpleasant smile dawned
upon his face.
. "Great Scott!" he exclaimed huskily.
"Whyâ it'sâ it's you!".
Amazement seemed to dry up the tor
rents of his speech. The girl regarded
him with the face of a sphinx. Only In
her eyes there seemed tp be some ap
prehension of the fact that the young
man's 'clothes and manners were alike
undesirable things. â¢ â¢
"Are you speaking to me?" she asked
calmlyr -"I am afraid that "you are
making a mistake. I am quite sure that
I do not know you."
Jf dull flush burned upon his cheeks.
He took his seat at ' the table, but
leaned forward to address her. 'A note
of belligerency had crept into his tone.
"Don't know me, eh? I like that.
You areâ or rather you wereâ" he cor
rected himself with an unpleasant little
laugh, "Miss Pellissier, eh?"
A little sensation followed upon his
words. Miss Ellicot pursed her lips
and sat a little, more upright. The
lady whose 'husband had been Mayor
of Hartlepool looked at Anna and
sniffed. * Mrs M White became conscious
of a distinct sense of uneasiness and
showed It In her face. She was obliged,
as she ; explained _ continually to every
one who Â¦ cared to listen, to be so very
particular. On the other hand the two
young men who sat on either side of
Anna were already < throwing murder
ous glances at the newcomer.
â¢'My name," Anna replied calmly, 'Is
certainly PelHssler,- buf I repeat that
I - do , riof know - you. I have never
known you.". â¢
He ~ unf elded , his serviette with fin
gers ..which , shook all .the time. His
eyes never left her'face. An ugly flush
stained his cheeks;
" "I've plenty of pals," he said, "who,
when they',ve"been doing Paris on the
Q. _T., ; -like. to" forget^ll about itâ even
their, names. .. But you â " Â¦
"Thank a you, ma'am.. Glad to get
back, I'm" sure," he said briskly. "Looks
like old times here, I see. Sorry I'm a
bit late the first evening. Got detained
in the city, andâ " â¢
Miss Ellicot swept aside her skirts
from the vacant chair and welcomed
the newcomer with one of her most en
gaging smiles.
"We were afraid that* you had desert
ed iis for good, Mr. Hill," she said gra
ciously. **T suppose Paris is very, very
distracting. You must come and tell
me all about it, although I am not sure
whether we shall forgive you for not
having written to any of us."
Mr. Hill was exchanging greetings
with his hostess' and salutations around
the table. -yW^
She stopped short. She herself, and
one other there, recognized the Inter
position of something akin to tragedy.
A thickly set, sandy young man, with
an unwholesome complexion and grease
smooth hair, had entered the room. He
wore a black tail coat buttoned tlghtly
over his chest, and a large diamond
pin sparkled in a white satin tie which
had seen better days. He bowed awk
wardly to Mrs. White, who held out her
hand and beamed a welcome upon him.
"Now, Isn't this nice!" that lady ex
claimed. "I'm sure we're all delighted
to see you again, Mr. Hill. I do like to
lee old friends back here." If there's
any one here whom you have not met I
will make you acquainted with them
after dinner. Will you take your old
place by Miss Ellicot?"
"Look round the tuble," she said.
"Aren't we all just odds and ends of
humanity â the left-overs, you know.
There is something inconglomerate
about us. We are amiable to one an
other, but we don't mix. We can't."
' I "You and I and Brendon get on all
right, don't we?" Sydney objected.
"We may be exceptions," Anna an
swered. "We can't disprove the theory.
Besides, :I am thinking more of our
relations with the rest of the world
than with one another. There's old
Sir. Carter, for instance. He has
grandchildren and nephews, but they
won't have anything to do with him.
They know that he has an evil temper,
a wretched digestion and nothing be
yond his pension. He's a left-over,
and so he's drifted here. Then there's
Mrs. Shaw. She has two married
daughters, but their husbands are do
ing well and getting their noses into,
at any rate, what they imagine to be
society. Mrs. Shaw eats peas with her
â¢knife. Ergo, Mrs. Shaw remains here.
'She; too, is a left-over. Miss Elli
cot. 5 and her mother have plenty
: of^' relatives. They won't have
'the girl to live with them because she
wants to marry every man she meets,
and isn't clever enough to hide it. Miss
Ellicot. too, is a left-over."
"How about Brendon and me?" Syd
ney asked.
â¢ "You two? Oh. you don't count. You
are only boys!" Anna laughed.
"I am 26 years old," Brendon said,
"and I object to being considered any
thing .of the sort. I do not mind being
called a left-over, but I object to not
counting." ,
"Well, then, you shall count for what
you like," Anna answered good-humor
edly, "but you are neither of you In the
least like the ordinary boarding-house
young man. You don't wear a dinner
coat with a flower in your buttonhole,
or last night's shirt, or very glossy
boots, nor do you haunt the drawing
room In the evening or play at being
. musical. Besides â "
She laughed gayly â and she had a
way when she laughed of throwing
back her head and showing her beau
tiful-white teeth, so that mirth from
her was a thing very much to be de
sired. .: Â¦;. -
She laughed.
?"After all, why should he be sur
prised?" she remarked. "Of course,
one lives differently in Paris, but then
â Paris is Paris. I think that a board
ing-house is the very best place for a
woman who wants to develop her
sense of humor. Only I wish that it
did not remind one so much of a sec
ond-hand clothes shop."
. Sydney looked at her doubtfully.
"Now I suppose Brendon under
stands exactly what you mean," he re
marked. "He looks as though he did.
at any rate. I don't! Please enlighten
me."
Anna, notwithstanding her mo
mentary fright in the middle of the
day/was in high spirits. She felt that
for a time at any rat* her depressing
struggle against continual failure was
at an end. She had paid her bill, and
she had enough left in her purse' to
pay many such. Beyond that every
thing was nebulous. She knew that in
her new role she was as likely as^not
to be a rank failure. But the relief
from the strain of her immediate ne
cessities was immense. She had been
in the drawing-room for a few minutes
before the gong had sounded and had
chattered gayly to every one. Now in
her old place she was doing her best
thoroughly to enjoy a most indifferent
dinner. â¢
"Your brother has gone?" she asked
Sydney between the courses.
He nodded.
"Yes, David left this afternoon. I
do not think that he has quite got over
his surprise at finding you established
here." â¢.. -

"This Is My Wife."
said. "I saw his face In a mirror. I
wonder "
"London is a huge place," Brendon
said. "Even If he lives here you may
go all your life and never come face to
face with him again."
"Quite right, quite right. Miss Elli
cot. I am sure you would," Mr. Carter
declared.
But It was not Mr. carter's approval
for which Miss Ellicot was anxious.
She glanced tentatively at her neigh
bor. He seemed to be paying very lit
tle attention either to his dinner or to
her. He was watching Anna with fre
quent stealthy and somber glances.
Miss Ellicot could not be sure even that
he had been listening. He had the air
of a man curiously absorbed.
Anna rose a few minutes . before the
general â¢ company. As though to bear
witness to the trujh of Miss"* Ellicofs
grave charges. Sydney and Brendon
also vacated their places. To reach
the doer they hadto pass the end oi
the table, and behmd the chair wherd
Mr. Hill was seated. He rosa deliber
ately to his feet and confronted them.
"I should like to speak to you for a
few minutes," he said to Anna, drop
ping his voice a little. "It Is no good
playing a game. "We had better have
If over." . :
Miss Ellicot looked hard into her
piate. It was all very well for men to
joke about such things, but her posi
tion was a difficult one. â¢ She was
obliged to be very careful.
"I should not go so far as to make
any statement of th:it sort," she said.
"Perhaps, too. Miss Pellissier claims
some extra license because she Is, or
calls herself an artist."
"Gone back to that, has she?** he
remarked under his breath. "Has she
Set up a studio here, then?"
"If she has." Miss Ellicot said, **no>
one has ever seen or heard of It. It's
my belief that the terra, 'artist' covers
a very great deal of ground. She's out
all day, but what she does with herself
no one knows. Then you remember Mr.
Courtlaw and Mr. Brendon, who aro
sitting on either si'le of her. The way
she behaves with th?m is really â Inde
corous. They whisper and laugh to
gether all through meals; and scarcely
speak to any one else, which at a
boarding-house table, where we are all
supposed to be frienrls and one family
to to. speak. Is not my idea ot good
manners. And then afterwards â you
will scarcely believe this, but It is ab
solutely true. Coffee, as I daresay you
remember, is alwaysv served In the
drawing-room immediately after din
ner, and as a rule, whatever our en
gagements for the evening may be, we
all have a sociable few minutes there.
Mrs. White is very considerate, and she
allows the gentlemen their cigarettes.
Miss Pellissier came In once â the sec
ond night she was here. - She made a
wry face at the coffee, which was per
haps not quite so strong as usual, and
since then, Mr. Hill, every evening she
takes those two young gentlemen up
into her own room and makes coffee
there in some sort of a ridiculous ma
chine. I don't know what you think
of that, but I call it a most improper
proceeding."
"No doubt about it," Mr. Carter de
clared cheerfully. "Most improper. I
wonder Mrs. White permits it. She
ought to be spoken to."
"I don't think," Miss Ellicot con
tinued, "that young ladles who are
living alone like Miss PeHisaier, and I
might say myself, for mother la so often
away, can be too particular." Personally
I should be very sorry indeed to do
anything which could give rise to so
much comment".;
"References! Oh. well, they're easy
enough to get hold of. aren't they, Mr.
Hill? Not that I want to be uncharit
able. I'm willing enough to be friends
v.ith any one. but I really am forced
to draw the line at a young woman
of her â peculiar habits."
Mr. Hill emitted a sound which 'was
something betwen a chuckle and a
snort. A reminiscent light gleamed In
hir eyes. fiKSH
"Bit frisky, oh?" he muttered.
Miss Ellicot. . who had been an
eager and interested listener. Inter
vened with a toys of the head.
He stopped short. Mr. Carter, after
waiting for several breathless Â¦ mo
ments to give him an opportunity of
finishing his sentence, dashed gallant
ly into the breach.
"You could soon settle her hash.
eh? No doubt about that. I've had
my suspicions all the time. Between
you and me. Mr. Hill, I'm surprised
at Mrs. White taking her In â very sur
prised ' indeed. This is really a very
select place, you know â all quite su
perior people. Mr. Building there was
a county councilor for many years,
and Mrs. Bodham's husband â the old
lady in ringlets there â was Mayor of
Kartlepool."
"She brought references, I sup
pose?" the young man remarked.
"Unpopular, eh?" the young man
repeated with an evil chuckle. "Well,
I rather think I could "
"Between you and me" â he leaned
over and whispered in th^ young man's
ear â "don't let that young woman's
sauce bother you. } I don't mind let
ting you into a bit of a secret. She's
a most unpopular person here."
The young man nodded, and looked
for the lirst time at his neighbor. Mr-
Carter was a little undersize. His
cheeks were thin and his color un
wholesome. He had a curious habit
of holding his head on one side -when
he talked and he bllnRed continually.
He- was nearer 60 than 50. He af
fected to be a student of life. His pet
weaknesses were to pose as a cynic
and to be regarded as an eligible
bachelor. He lived on an annuity of
Â£150, but was constantly studying the
Financial Times. A drop in consuls
depressed him for the whole evening.
He was always au fait with the latest
Stock Exchange rumors. Anna did not
like him and he did not like Anna.
Oh, I hope so." Mr. Carter replied.
"No doubt, no doubt. You've been
a great traveler. I dare say. Know
what's what, eh? You young men do
pick it up nowadays. My name's Car
ter, Mr. Hill. Dare say you don't re
member me. Glad to welcome you
back, sir."
"Very much obliged," Mr. Hill an
swered. "It's doubtful whether I shall
stop long."
The young man fingered his wine
glass and gazed at its contents patron
izingly.
"H'm!" he remarked. "I've drunk
better."
"Come." she said. "We mustn't have
any unpleasantness, and Mr. Hill's first
night back among us, <oo. No doubt
there's some little mistake. We all get
deceived sometimes. Mr. Hnl, I hope
you won't find everything cold. You're
a little late, you must remember, and
we are punctual "people here." â¢
"I shall do very well, thank you,
ma'am," he answered shortly.
Sydney and Brendon vied with one
another in their efforts to engage Anna
in conversation and Miss Ellicot, dur
ing the momentary lull, deemed .it a
favorable opportunity to recommence
siege operations. The young man was
mollified by her sympathy and flatter
ed bv the obvious attempts of several
of the other guests to draw him Into
cc-nversation. Yet every now and then
during the progress of the meal his
attention apparently wandered and.
leaning forward, he glanced covertly
at Anna with a curious mixture of ex
pressions on his face.
"Very nice claret you've chosen,
sir," his left hand neighbor remarked.
"Sound, good wine. Always drink it
myself, but I'm on whisky for a week.
Doctor's orders. Liver! Always obey
my doctor. Sort of superstition after

most entirely with him. Anna was no
favorite at No. 13 Montague street.

unruffled composure, "to be a very Im

"A wonderful piece of work," he de
clared. "A most wonderful likeness,
too. I hope in a few days, Miss Pel
lissler, that these posters will be liven
ing up our London hoardings."
Anna leaned back in the chair and
laughed softly. Even this man had
accepted her for "Alcide" without a
moment's question. Then all the em
barrassments of the matter flashed in
upon her. She was suddenly grave.
"I suppose, Mr. Earles." she said,
"that if I were to tell you that although
that poster was designed from a rough
study of me, and although my name is
Pcllissier, nevertheless, I am not 'Al
clde,' Mould you believe me?" .
Anna looked and gasped. An enor
mous poster almost covered one side
of the, wallâ the poster. The figure of
the girl upon It Jn plain black djess,
standing with her hands behind her,
was an undeniable and astonishing
likeness cf herself. It was her figure,
her style of dress, her manner of ar
ranging the hair. Mr. Earles regarded
it approvingly.
Mr. Earle* recovered his spirits.
"Excellent!" he exclaimed. "Your
arrival Is really most opportune. The
halls are on the lookout for something
new. By the by, do you recognize
tha.tr*
"Iâ oh, no!" Anna said, a little
faintly. "I have made no arrange
ments aÂ« yetâ none at alL"
"Come," h* taid, f'this is capital
capital. It was only a few months
ago that I told you you must come to
London, and you only laughed at me.
Yet here you are. and at precisely the
right moment, too. By the by," he
added. In a suddenly altered tone, "I
hope, I trust â that you have not en
tered Into any arrangements with any
one here?"
"My deary Miss Pellissier." he said
Impressively, "this is an unexpected
pleasure. Come in! Come in, do. I
must apologize for my young puppy of
a. clerk. If I had known that you
were here you should not have been
kept waiting for a second."
It took a good deal to surprise Anna,
but it was ail she could do to follow
Mr. Earles with composure Into the
Inner room. There was a little mur
mur of consternation from the waiting
crowd, and the florid young woman
phowed signs of temper, to which Mr.
Earles was absolutely indifferent. He
installed Anna In a comfortable easy
chair and placed his own between her
and the door.
Mr. Karles strode into the waiting
room. His face was wreathed in
emiles. his be-ringed finger hand was
cor-lially outstretched. '
The youth produced a crumpled-up
card from his waistcoat pocket. A
FÂ«>nse of impending disaster was upon
him. Mr. Earles glanced at it, and
his ryes flashed with anger.
"You blithering idiot!" he exclaimed.
The young man obeyed the summons.
HI* employer retreated into the further
apartment, leaving the door ajar.
"What's that young lady's name â

Mr. Karles asked sharply.
"In a minute, in a minute." he an
swered, his eyes fixed upon Anna.
"Rpubvii. come here."

near the door. Anna picked up an
ancient copy c-f the Era, and began to
turn over the pages in a leisurely way.
Th*Â» conversation which her entrance
had iruenirytfd br-pan to buzz again

passed. Then the inner door opened
abruptly. A tall, clean-shaven man

the room, exchanging greetings right

Ktc-od upon the threshold of his sanc
tum, the prototype of the smart, natty
Jew, with bla<-k hair, waxed mustache,
and a wired flower in his button-hole.
A ficrid-looking young woman rose up
and ?vcosted him eagerly.
'I'm next, Mr. Earles." she ex
claimed. "Been sitting on the doorstep
almost fur two hours."
The young man save it up and en
tered into a lively little war of words
"Unless you have an appointmentâ
which you haven't," he said, "you'll
only waste your time here."
"I can spare it," Anna answered
suave' v.
She removed some posters from a
chair and seated herself coolly. The
young man looked at her.
"Not doing anything in stock com
panies Just now." he remarked.
"Indet-d." Anna answered. "Very
sensible of him, I'm sure."
There was a little titter. The young
man turned 'on his heel.
"Have to take vour turn," he re
marked laconically. "There's twenty
before you, and Mr. Earles Is going out
at 12 charpâ important engagement.
Better come another morning."
"Thank you," Anna answered. "I will
take my chance."
Every one stared at Anna. Anna
rtarci back at every one with un
daunted composure. A Hebraic looking
voung man with shiny frock coat and
very high collar advanced toward her
languidly.
"Want to see Mr. Earles?" he in
quired.
"I do," Anna answered. "Here is my
card. Will you take it into him?"
The young man smiled in a superior
manner.
MR. KAULUS?.
STRICTLY FRIVATE
On Saturday mornings there was de
posited on thÂ» plate of each guest at
breakfast time a long folded paper
with Mrs. White's compliments. Anna
thrust hers into her pocket unopened,
and for the first time left the house
without a smile upon her face. She

The lew Â«>*-nce left in her purse would
only !/f.\ide a very scanty lunch. An
other day tif non -success would mean
many disagreeable things.
And fven the was forced to admit to
herself that this last resource of hers
was a slender reed on which to lean.
She mounted the stairs of the theatrical
agent's office with very much less than
her usual buoyancy, nor did she find
much encouragement in the general ap
pearance of the room into which she
was shown. There were already a
tcor" or more of people there, some
standing up and talking together,
others seated in chairs ranged along
the wall. Beyond was another door,
on which was printed in black letters:
The Poster of "Alcide."
CHAPTER XIV.
"You can count upon me, Nigel*" she
said. "But for you dad would never
have let me marry Lascelles. He was
only a younger son. and you know
what trouble we had. I am with you
through thick and thin. Nigel."
He kissed her. and handed her into
the carriage. Then he went back to
his rooms and lit a cigar.
"There are two things to be done,"
he said softly to himself. "The tirst
is to discover what she is here for.
and where sheis staying. The second
is to somehow' meet Lady Ferringhall.
These fellows must be right," he added
thoughtfully, "and yetâ there's a mys

"Are you serious?"

never Joke on such a subject. Mind
I am anticipating events. Nothing is
settled upon. It may be. it probably

to know whether in such an event you
would stand by me?"
She held out her hand.

with uplifted eyebrows, but made no
remark.
"I shall probably want you to come
down to the 'Universal' to-morrow
morning," he said. "Bring any new
songs. you may have.". Â«Â¦ -
. Anna nodded, and Mr. Earles attend
ed her obsequiously to the door. She
descended the stairs, and found her
self at last in the streetâ alone. It was
a brief solitude, howeyer. A young
man, who had been spending the last
hour walking ud and down on the op
posite side of the way. came quickly
over to her. She looked up, and recog
nized Mr. Brendon.
He plunged into one of his drawers
and brought up a small gold-foiled
bottle. The cork came out with a loud
pop, and Anna could not help wonder
ing how it must sound to the patient
little crowd . outside. She drank her
glass of wine, however, and clanked
glases good-naturedly with Mr. Earles.
"You must leave me vour address if
you please," he said, as she rose to go.
"Perhaps," he queried, "you wish to
avoid being Been about with any one â
erâ connected with the profession, un
der present circumstances. If so, do
not hesitate to tell me. Be frank, I beg
you. Miss Pelllssier. I am already too
much flattered that you should have
given me your confidence."
"You are very good, Mr. Earles,"
Anna said. "I think, perhaps if you
will excuse me, that we will defer the
luncheon."
"Just as you wish," Mr. Earles de
clared good-humoredly, "but I shall
not let you go without drinking a glass
of Vine to our sucess."
"I will send you a copy." Mr. Earles
said, rubbing his hands together, "by
post. Now, will you do me the
honor of lunching with me, Miss Pel-
Anna hesitated.
He handed her a check for 31 pounds
10 shillings and read* the agree
ment through to her. Anna took up
the pen and signed after a moment's
hesitation,
A. PELLISSIER.
"You will nut object," he said,
glancing toward her, "to accepting a
deposit. It is customary, even where
an agreement is drawn."
"I shall have no objection at all,"
Anna assured him.
He struck a note and Anna respond
ed. Playing with one hand, he turned
on his stool to glance at her. In
stinctively she had fallen into the pos
ture of the poster, her hands behind
her, her head bent slightly forward,
her chin uplifted, her eyes bright with
the drollery of the song. Mr. Earles
closed the piano with a little bang.
"You are a funny, a very funny
young: lady," he said. "But we waste
time, here. You do not need my com
pliments. We will get on with the
agreement, and you shall have In it
whatever rubbish you like."
Anna laughed and went back to her
easy chair. She knew that her voice
was superior to Annabel's, and she had
no further qualms. While she was
wondering how to frame her request
for an advance Mr. Earles drew out
his checkbook.
"You must also put in the agree
ment." Anna said, "that I do not rep
resent myself to be 'Alcide,' and that
I am not advertised to the public by
that name."
Mr. Earles threw down his pen with
a little exclamation.
"Come this way," he said.
He opened the door of still another
room, in one corner of which was a
grand piano. He seated himself be
fore .it.
"Go to the far corner." he. said, "and
sing the last verse of 'Les Petites.' "
"It scarcely gives me a chance," Mr.
Earles said with a resigned sigh, "but
I shall rely upon you to stick to me
so- long as* I do the right thing
you. You can't do without an agent,
and" there's no one who can run you
better than I can."
"Better say six," Mr. Earles protest
ed, seating himself before the desk and
dipping his pen in the ink. '
"Four," Anna decided firmly. -"I
shall not agree to six."
"You needn't say a word more," Mr.
Karles declared. ."I see the difficulty.
The eld fool's been working on you
through your sister to keep off the
stage. He's a prig to the- finger tips,
is Sir' John â doesn't know what an
artist is. It's awkward, but we'll get
round it somehow. . Now . I'll tell you
what I propose. Let me run you for
six months. I'll give you, say, 35
guineas a week clear of expenses, and
half of anything you earn above the
two turns a night. What do you
say?"
"I agree." Anna said coldly, "if you
will make it three months." -
"Call it what you like," Anna an
swered. "I can sing the songs 'Alcide'
sang, and in the same style. But 1
will not be engaged as 'Alcide' or ad
vertised under that name."
Mr. Earles scratched -his chin for a
moment thoughtfully. Then a light
seemed to break in upon him. He
slapped his knee.
"By Jove!" he exclaimed. "Of course,
I remember now. It was your sister
who married Sir John Ferringhall the
other day, wasn't it?" -
Anna nodded.
"It was," she admitted.
"'I hope that you may," Anna an
swered enigmatically. "In the, first
place, I have no objection to the posÂ»
ters, as they have no name on them,
but I do not wish to appear at all upon
the stage as â¢Alcide.* If you engage
me it must be upon my own merits.
You are taking it for granted that I
am 'Alcide.' As a matter of fact, I am
not." â¢ . f ; : .
"Excuse me," Mr. Earles said, "but
this is rubbish."^ ',",'' -V--
"Don't use such a word, my dear
yuung lady," Mr. Earles said persua
sively. "Difficulties indeed. We'll make
short work of them." -
"I should be satisfied with the sum
you mention," Anna said quietly, "but
there are difficulties." t
"Guineas, of course," Mr. Earles an
swered, glibly. "Forty guineas a week.
I mentioned sixty, I believe, when I
was in Paris, but there are expenses,
and just now business is bad."
Anna was speechless, but she had the
presence of .mind enough to sit still
until she recovered herself. Mr. Earles
watched her anxiously. She appeared
to be considering. ..
"Of course," he ventured, "I could
try for more at the 'Alhambra.' Very
likely they would give "
'I have no choice," Anna declared
"I can get you," Mr. Earles said,
slowly, keeping his eyes fixed upon her,

answer would be to ask you to look at
that mirror and then at v the poster.

ror and then at the poster. The like^
ness was ridiculous.
"Well?" she said, sitting, down again.
"I want an engagement." '
"Capital!" Mr. Earles declared. "Any

THE SAN â¢Â¦Â¦; FRANCISCO SUNDAY- CALIl
The external changes in Brendon fol
lowing on his alteration of fortune were
sufficiently noticeable. From head to
foot he was attired in the fashionable
garb of the young man of the moment.
Not only that, but he carried himself
erectâ the slight slouch which had bent
his shoulders had altogether dlsap-THE SAN; FRANCISCO' SUNDAY^ CALL'.
She eyed him scornfully. In any place
her beauty would have been an~uncom
mon thing. Here, where every element
of her surroundings was tawdry and
commonplace, and before this young
man of vulgar origin and appearance,
it was striking. i'Â« :^
"I do not know.you," she said coldly.
"I have nothing to say^to you."
He stood before the^loor. Brendcm
made a quick movement forward. She
laid her hand upon his arm.
"Please don't," she said. "It really is
not necessary. Be so good as to let me
pass, sir." she added, looking her ob
structor steadily in the face.
He nesitated.
"This is all rot!" he declared an
griiy. "You can't think that I am fool
enough to be put off like this."
She glanced at Brendon, who stood
by her side, tall and threatening. Her
c-ycbrowB were lifted in expostulation.
A faint, delightfully humorous smile
parted her iips.
"After all.'.' she said, "if this per
son will not be reasonable. I am
afraid â "
It was enough. A hand of iron feil
upon the scowling young man's shoul
der.
"Be so good as to stand away from
that door at once, sir," Brendon or
dered.
Hill lost a little of his truculency.
He knew very well that his muscles
were flabby, and his nerve by no
means what it should be. He was no
match for Brendon. He yielded hia
place and struck instead with his
tongue. He turned to Mrs. White.
"I'm sorry, ma'am, to seem the
cause of any disturbance, but this," he
pointed to Anna, "is my wife."
The t-er.sation produced was grati
fying enough. The man's statement
was explicit, and spoken with confi
dence. Every one looked at Anna. For
a moment she too had started and
faltered In her exit from the robin.
Her fingers clutched the side of che
door as though to steady herself. She
caught her breath, and her eyes were
lit with a sudden terror. She recov
ered herself, however, with amazing
facility. Scarcely any one noticed the
full measure of her consternation.
From the threshold she looked her ac
cuser steadily and coldly in the fa.c-3.
"What you have said is a ridiculous
falsehood." she declared scornfully.
"I do not even know who you are."
She swept out of the room. Hill
would have followed her, but Mis.
White and Miss Ellicot laid each a
hand upon his arm. one on either side.
The echoes of his hard, unpleasant
laugh reached Anna on her way up
stairs.
CHAPTER XVIL
Mr. Sfontague Hill Makes Himself
Objectionable.
It was a queer little bed-sitting-room,
almost In the roof, with Â¦ a partition
right across it. As usual. Brendon lit
the candles and Sydney dragged out
the spirit-lamp and set it going. Anna
opened a cupboard and produced cups
and saucers and a tin of coffee.
"Only four spoonfuls left," she de
clared briskly, "and your \ turn to buy
the next pound, Sydney."
"Right!" he answered. "I'll bring it
to-morrow. Fresh ground, no chicory,
and all the rest of it. Butâ Miss Pellis
"Are you quite sure that you want us
this evening? Wouldn't you rather be
alone? Just say the word, and we'll
clear out like a shot."
She laughed softly.
"You are afraid," she said, "that the
young man who thinks that he is my
husband has upset me."
"Madman!"
"Blithering ass!"
"The eirl looked Into the two Indig
nant faces and held out both her hands.
"You're very nice, both of you." she
Eaid gently. "But I'm afraid you are
going to be in a hopeless minority here
as regards me."
They eyed her incredulously.
"You can't imagine," Sydney ex
claimed, "that the people downstairs
will be such driveling asses as to be
lieve piffle like that."
Anna measured out the coffee. Her
eyes were lit with a gleam of humor.
After all, it was really rather funny.
"Well, I don't know," she said
thoughtfully. "I always notice that peo
ple find it very easy to believe what
they want to believe, and you see I'm
not in the least popular. Miss Ellicot,
for instance, considers me a most im
proper person."
"Miss Ellicot! That old cat!" Sydney
exclaimed- indignantly.
"Miss Ellicot!" Brendon echoed. "As
if It could possibly matter what such a
person thinks of you."
Anna laughed outright.
"You are positively eloquent to-night
âboth of you," she declared. "But, you
see, appearances are very much against
me. He knew my name, and also that
I had been living in Paris, and a man
doesn't risk claiming a girl for his wife,
as a rule, for nothing. He was pain
fully in earnest, too. I think you will
find that his story will be believed,
whatever I say; and in any case, if he
is going to stay on here, I shall have to
go away." " â¢
"Don't say that," Sydney begged.
"We shall see that he never annoys
you."
Anna shook her head.
"He is evidently a friend of Mrs.
White's," she said, "and if he is
going to persist in this delusion,
we cannot both remain here., I'd
rather not go." she added. "This
is much the cheapest place I know
of where things are moderatelv clean,
and I should hate rooms all by myself.
Dear me, what a nuisance it is to have
a pseudo husband shot down upon ons
from the skies."
"And such a beast of a one," Sydney
remarked vigorously.
Brendon looked across the room at
her thoughtfully.
"I wonder," he said, 'Ms "there any
thing we could 'do to help you to get
rid of him?"
"Can you think of anything?" Anna
answered. "I can't! He appears to be
a most immovable person."
Brendon hesitated for a moment. He
was a little embarrassed.
"There ousht to be , some means of
getting at him," he said. '.'The fellow
seems to know your name. Miss Pellis
Â«Ier, and that you. have lived in Paris.
Might we ask you if you have ever
seen him. if you knew him at all before
this evening?"
She stood un suddenly, and turning
her back to them, looked steadily out
of the window. Below was an unln
eplring street, a thoroughfare of board
lng-houses and apartments. The steps.
evÂ«n the pavements, were invaded by
little knots of loungers driven outside
,by the unusual heat of the evening,
a most of them in evening dress, or what
passed for evening dress In Montague
street The sound of their strident
voices floated upward, the high nasal
note of th* predominant Americans,
the shrill laughter. of girls quick to ap
preciate toe wit of such of .their 'male
companions as thought It worth while
to be amusing. A voung ,man was
playing the banjo. In the distance a
barrel organ was grinding out a pot
pourri of popular airs. Anna raised
her eyes. Above the housetops it was
different. She drew a long breath.
After all, why need one look down? Al
ways the other things remained.
"I think," she said, "that I would
rather not have anything to say about
that man."
"It isn't necessary," they both de- v
clared breathlessly.
Brendon dismissed the subject with
a wave of the hand. He glanced at his
watch.
"Let us walk round to Covent Gar
den," he suggested. "I daresay the.
pallery will be full, but there is always
the chance, and I know you two are
keen on Melba."
The girl shook her head.
"Not to-night," she said. "I have to
go out." *
They hesitated. As a rule their com
ings and coings were discussed with
perfect confidence, but on this occasion
they both felt that there was Intent in
her silence as to her destination. Nev
ertheless Sydney, clumsily but earnest
ly, had something to say about it.
"I am afraidâ I really think that one
of us ought to go with you," he said.
"That beast of a fellow is certain to be
hanging about."
She shook her head.
"It is a. secret mission," she declared.
"There are policemen â and omnibuses."
"You shall not need either," Brendon
said grimly. "We will see that he
doesn't follow vou."
She thanked him with a look and
rose to her feet. â¢ -
"Go down and rescue the rags of my
reputation," she said, smiling. "I ex
pect It is pretty well In shreds by now.
To-morrow morning I shall have raa\ie
up my mind what to do."
* * . *
"I must confess," Mr. Carter said,'
pursing out his lips in a manner pe
culiar to him, "that the young lady
has always been an object of some
suspicion to me."
"The way she monopolizesâ has al
ways monopolized those two jf/mng
men is most barefaced," Miss Ellicot
declared. "Still, one must not be un
charitable. I wish it were possible to
get rid of one's suspicions."
"Her -references," Mrs. White said
anxiously, "were really excellent."
Miss Ellicot Bmiled. Mr. Carter also
smiled. Mrs. Bodham shook her head
solemnly.
"References are so easy, my dear
Mrs. White," she said.
Mr. Building gulped down his coffee
and grunted audibly.
"God bless my sc/ul," he said, "what's
wrong with the girl? Scarcely spoken
a word to her in nÂ»y life, but if it's 7 her
story against Hill's, give her a chance,
I say." ,â¢
Hill himself at that moment entered.
He was carrying j^n his hand a folded
paper. He addressed himself to Mrs.
White. . â¢Â£-.":
"I've brought you this document to
look at, m'am," he said. "Read It
through and-, show it to all the
other ladies ! and gentlemen, if
you like. I'm not asking, you
to take my word against any
one's. There's proofâ all the proof that
any sane person can need."
Mr. Carter made his way to Mrs.
White's side. His eyes were bright
with curiosity. With twitching fingers
he drew from his pocket a pair of
spectacles and hastily adjusted them.
"Dear, dear me. what's this?" he
exclaimed. "What's this? Upon my
word, a marriage certificate. It is in
deed â a marriage certificate."
The young man stood with his hands
in his trousers pockets, an unlit cigar
in the corner of his mouth. V,Â»
"Read it," he said. "Read it, all of
you. I don't mind. Nothing seqret
about me. Montague Hill â that's my
name â and Annabel Pelllsslerâcom
monly known as Anna, I believe. Mar
ried at the British Embassy at .Paris.
Bit swagger that, you know, and cost
me a pretty penny. What's . the odds,
though? Montague Hill's no pauper â
no, sir."
He bit off the end of his cigar and
stretched out his hand for the paper,
which Mrs. White held toward him.
Mr. Carter, however, was quick to
seize it. â¢ Â»
"Dear, dear me!" he exclaimed, pur
sing out his lips. "It is Indeed a mar
riage certificate. Montague Hill, bach
elor, and Annabel Pellissier, spinster.
All quite correct. My dear sir, you
have my sympathy."
"Don't want it," the young man de
clared brusquely. "Give me the pa
per."
Mr. Carter parted with it reluc
tantly. He took a long time fold
ing It up and Mr. Hill - at last
snatched It unceremoniously from
his hands. Brendon and . Courtlaw
entered at that moment Their appear
ance was so unexpected and so unusual
that there was a moment's silence.
Then Miss Ellicott, with a thin little
smile, motioned" to them to join her on
the sofa. . . Â¦ .
"Dear, dear me! Isn't this a sad
thing?" she exclaimed, "and you all
such friends, too."
Brendon stretched out his long legs,
and looked thoughtfully at his- toes.
"Isn't what sad?" he asked calmly.
"Why this affair about Miss Pelliss
ierâor Mrs. Hill, as I suppose we must
call her. To think that we never sus
pected It! But perhaps you two knew.
Such friends as you have been. I dare
say she told you all about It."
"All about what?" Brendon asked
again.
"Why, her marriage, of course," Miss
Ellicot said calmly.
They both looked at her.
"Surely," Brendon exclaimed, "no
body here can honestly believe that
ridiculous story."
"Fancy," Sydney Courtlaw remarked,
"a girl like Miss Pelllssler married to
a bounder like that fellow Hill. Can't
think how he had the nerve to try it
on. even for bluff."
Miss Ellicot sighed and looked de
murely into her lap.
"Dear me, .1 thought that you knew,"
she murmured. "We have all been
shockingly deceived, Mr. 1 Brendon. Mr.
Hill's story is perfectly true. He has
the marriage certificate here. We have
all seen It."
Brendon laughed scornfully.
"Fifty marriage certificates would
never convince me," he declared, "that
Miss Pelllssler was ever married to, or
even thought of. marrying a fellow like
Hill. Why, he Isn't a gentlemanâ hasn't
- even the â¢ outward appearance of one.
His story Is absurd on the very face of
it." â¢ '.
V "Absurd!" Sydney muttered. "It's
damned ridiculous," he added, under
his breath.
"You are very foolish,". Miss Ellicot
; eald sttarply. "People. don't forge mar
riage certificates nowadays."
The young man turned away â¢ from
Mrs.' White and glanced truculently to
ward them. '
"What's that about forging marriage
certificates?" he asked. * .
Miss Ellicot smileU up at him sweetly.
"It Is nothing, Mr, Hill," she declared.
"Only I cannot persuade Mr. ; Brendon,
and Mr. Courtlaw here, who are great
friends of Miss Pelllssier, : , that ' she is
really married to you." i Â¦Â¦.-. : , :>
He looked at them with, darkening;
face.
"I don't know as it matters," he said
slowly. , "I don't know as. it matters
either way. But I don't want to hear
anything about forgery, or, there'll . be
trouble.* If a properly stamped and wit
nessed legal document ain't to be-be
lievedâwell,. it "isn't likely that any
thing I could say would convince
them." -, "Â¦'â¢Â¦Â¦ '
"You are quite right, Mr. ' Hill."
Brandon* said coolly. "Neither, yoar
document nor anything you could say
would ever Induce me tq believe your
story. Put it away, please. ".Pray don't
waste your time showing It to me."
"I wasn't going to," Hill Â¦ declared.
"What you believe, or ' don't I believe,
wouldn't trouble me in the least. Facts
ar^ facts, and I can prove all I say, as
you'll know before long." '
The door lead inp into the .hall stood
wldel open. Hill ;urned v Buddenly to
ward it. Brendon, even more-quick in
his movements, blocked the way. Anna
had descended the stairs and was pass
ing along th<Â» passage. Â¦ .
"Here, let me pass!" Hill exclaimed.
Sydney joined Brendon. . Every one
in the rocm regarded the three young
men with breathless Interest. . ;
"I... tb'nk not," Brendon said j - coolly.
"You,have made yourself objectionable
enough already to Miss Pellissier. -Sit
down, pleas^." Â¦' . .
"But I won't sit down," Hill declared,
fuming. "What right have you to in-,
terfere between a man and his wife,
eh?"- > Â¦ ,- , -..-â¢:;
"Fiddlesticks," Brendon declared
scornfully. . .
"Rot!" Sydney echoed.^
Hill pushed forward.
"I'll show you whether it's >rot or
not," he exclaimed fur jously.*
He found himself suddenly. In the
grasp of a giant. .He was set down
gently upon a chair, 1 " and he felt as
though all the breath had been shaken
out of his body. Outside ln> the, street
an omnibus had stopped to pick up. a
passenger. Glancing over his shoulder,
Brendon saw 'Anna climbing briskly up
the stairs to the top.

. "A Marriage Certificate.
Anna looked about her admiringly.
It was just such a , bedroom as* she
would have chosen, for herself. The
coloring was' gri't-n . and white,' with
softly shaded electric lights, an alcove
bedstead, which- vas a miracle ot daln-_
tlness, white furniture and a long low
dressing table Htiered all over with: a
multitude, of daintily fashioned toilet
appliances. Through an 'open door was
a glimpse of the bathroomâ a vision .of
luxury, QUt of which Annabel herself,
in a wonderful dressing-gown and fol
lowed bv a maid, presently appeared.
"Too.bad 'to keep .you waiting," An
nabel exclaimed. "I'm really very
sorry. Collins, you can go nowv; I will
ring if I want you."
The maid discreetly withdrew, and
Anna stood transfixed, gazing, with
puzzled frown at her sister. Â¦ .
. "Annabel! Why, what on earth have
you been doing to yourself, child?" she
exclaimed. â¢ .'Â¦,, . , ; K -
Annabel laughed. a little uneasily.

- "I think," Anna said, "that the less

looking: round.' .; ,'
Annabel shook her head. â¢
"Most of it is ugly and frowsy," she
declared, "but It isn't worth talking

Anna looked at Â»her sister steadily.
"He will find it difficult, no doubt,
to alter his style of living," she said,
"I do. not blame him. I hope you will
always remember â "
"Annabel held out her hands with^a
little cry of protest.
"No lecturing, Anna!" she exclaimed.
"I hope you* have not come for that.''.'- Â¦''[
"I came," Anna- enswered, looking,
her sister steadily in the face, "to hear
all. that, you can 1 tell me about a man .
- named Hill.". .
Annabel had been lying curled up on :
*he lounge, the personification of grace
ful animal ease. , At Anna's words rne ,
seemed suddenly to stiffen. Her softly
interwmed fingers became rigid, 'he Utr :

reason ' of this new pallor, which
seemed to draw the color even from
her lips! But she did not speak. She
made no , attempt to answer her sis
ter's question. Anna looked at her
curiously, and -with sinking heart.
"You must answer me, Annabel," she
continued. , "You must tell me Â«the
truth, please. It is necessary." * ; ,'*;.
Annabel rose, slowly ...to *her ; feet,
walked to the door as though to see
that it was shut, and came back with
slow, lagging footsteps.' . ' -
"There was a man called ; Montague

dead." ' , . Â¦â¢ '..-'-. Â¦...Â¦-â¢ â¢'Â¦ââ¢.Â¦
I ".Then there Is also," Anna remarked,
"a Montague Hill who Is very much

him.*" Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦'-., Â¦.
â¢ . Annabel no longer attempted 'to con
ceal her emotions. She battled with a
_ deadly . falnthess, ;"Â¦Â¦-. and she tottered,
"rather than walked back' to her seat.,
Anna, quitting her chair, dropped' on
her knees by her sister's side and took
her hand.
"Do not be frightened dear," she
said. "You must tell me the truth, ;
and I will see' that no harm comes to
â¢ you." . ,.
"The only Montague Hill I ever
knew," Annabel said slowly, "Is dead. I*

I struck him across the mouth and
across the eyes. Ha lost control of the
machine. I Jumped then â I was not
even shaken. I saw the motor dashed
to pieces against the wall, and I saw
him pitched on his head into the road.
I leaned over and looked at him. He
was quite still. I could not hear his
heart beat. I thought that he was dead.
I stole away and walked to the railway
station. .VThat night in Paris I saw on
the bills 'Fatal Motor Accident.' Le
Petit Journal said that the man was
dead. I was afraid that I might be
called upon as a witness. That is why
I was so anxious. to leave Paris. The

that night 'was his friend."

herself shaken 1 with fear. "You were

restlessly up and , down . the room. An
nabel watched vher - with wide-open,
terrified eyes." ' : .â¢* Â¦ *
Â¦ "You won't give me away, Anna. Tie

are much more like what" I was then."
Anna stopped in front of her.
â¢: "You don't propose, do you," she said
Â¦quietly, "that I should take this man
tor ray husband?"
... "You can drive him away," Annabel
cried. "Tell him that he is mad. Go
and live somewhere else."
"la. his present mood," Anna re
marked, "he would follow me."
"Oh, , you are strong and brave/*
Annabel murmured. "You can keep
him at arm's length. Besides, it was
under false pretenses. He told mÂ» that
he was a millionaire. It could not be a
Wgal marriage." . .
"I am .very much afraid," Anna
answered, "that it was. It might be
upset. I am wondering . whether it
would not be better to tell your hus
band everything. You will never be
happy with this hanging over you."
; Annabel moistened her dry lips with
a handkerchief steeped in eau de
cologne.
Â¦ VYou don't know him, Anna," she
said with a little, shudder,- "or you
would not talk like that. He is steeped
in the conventions. Every slight action
is influenced . by what he imagines
would be the opinion of other people.
Anything in the least irregular is like
poison to him. He has no imagination,
no "real generosity. You might tell the
truth to some men, but never to him."
Anna was thoughtful. A conviction
that her sister's words were true had
from the first possessed her.
"Annabel," she said slowly, "if I
fight this thing out myself, can I trust
you that it will not be a vain sacrifice?
After what you have said it is useless
for us to play with words. You do
not love your husband; you have mar
ried him for a position â to esca"pe from
â things which you feared. Will you
be a faithful and honest wife? Will
you do your duty by him and forget
all your past follies? Unless, Annabel,
you can â "
"Oh, I will pledge you my word,"
Annabel .cried passionately, "my sol
emn word. Believe me, Anna. Oh.
you must believe me. I have been very
foolish, but it Is over."
"Remember that you are still young,
and' fond of admiration;", Anna said.
"You wjll not give Sir John any cause
for Jealousy? You will have no se
crets from him except â concerning
those things which are past?"
"Anna, I. swear It!" > her sister sob

add that if a certain amount is needed
to set you free from any debts you
may have contracted, in additibn to
this annuity you will not find me un
reasonable."
Anna glanced momentarily toward
her sister, but Annabel neither spoke
nor moved.
"With regard to the conditions I
mentioned," Sir John continued, gain
ing a little confidence from Anna Â»
silence. "I think you will admit that
they are not wholly unreasonable. I
should require you to accept no em
ployment whatever upon the stage,
and to remain out of. England. '
Anna's demeanor was still Imperturb
able, her marble pallor untinged by
the slightppt Hush of color. She regard
ed him coldly, as though wondering
whether he had anything further to say.
Sir John hesitated, and then continued.
"I trust," he said, "that you will
recognize the Justice of these condi
tions. Under happier circumstances
nothing would have given me morÂ«
pleasure than to have offered you a
home with your sister. You yourseir,
I am sure, recognize . how Impossible
you have made it for me now to do
anything of the sort. I may say that
tWe amount of annuity I propose to al
low you Is two hundred a year."
Anna looked for a moment steadily
at her sister, whose face was still
averted. Then she moved toward the
door. Before she passed out she turned
and faced Sir John. The impassivity of
her features changed at last. Her eyes
were lit with mirth, the corners of her
mouth quivered.
"Really, Sir John," she said, "I don't
know how to thank you. I can under
stand now these newspapers when they
talk of your magnificent philanthropy.
It is magnificent indeed. And yetâ you
millionaires should really, I think, cul
tivate the art of discrimination. I am
so much obliged to you for your
projected benevolence. Frankly, it is
the funniest thing which has ever hap
pened to me In my life. I shall like to
think of Itâ whenever I feel dulL Good
by, Anna!"
Annabel sprang up. Sir John waved
her back.
"Do I understand you then to refusd
my offer?" he asked Anna,
She shot a sudden glance at him. Sir
John felt hot and furious. It was mad
dening to be made to feel that he was
In anv way the inferior of this cool,
self-possessed voung woman, whose
eyes seemed for a moment to scintllato
with scorn: There were one or two bit
ter moments In his life when he had
been made tc feel that gentility laid on
with a bn.i?h may sometimes crack and
show weak places â that deportment
and breeding are after all things apart.
Her cheeks burned for a moment or
two when she reached the street, al
though she held her head upright and
walked blithely, even humming to her
self fragments of an old French song.
And then at the street corner she came
face to face with Nigel Ennison.
"I won't pretend." he said, "that this
Is an accident. The fates are never so
kind to. me. As a matter of fact I have
been waiting f or you."
She raised her eyebrows.
"Really," she said. "And by what
right do you do anything of the sort?"
."No right at all," he admitted. "Only
It is much too late for you to be out
alone. You have been to see your sis
ter, of course. How Is she?"
"My sister is quite well, thank you."
she answered. "Would you mind call
ing that hansom for me?"
He looked at it critically and shook
his head.
"You really couldn't ride In it," he
said, deprecatingly. "The horse's knees
are broken, and I am not sure that the
man Is sober. I would sooner see you
much as a woman of 45.
Annabel shrugged her-shoulders.
"I 'only use the .weeniest little dab of
rouge," she declared, "and it is really
necessary, because I want to get rid of
the 'pallor effect.' Do you remember,
when we were both called the 'Moon
light Madonnas'? And, you know, now
adays it is piquante to makeup, if you
don't really need ( to. Men like it." .
Anna made no/ remark. Her disap
proval -was' obvious, enough. Annabel
saw it and suddenly* changed her. tone.
"You are very' stupid, Anna," she
said. "Can you not understand? It is
of nb use your taking my identity and
all the burden of my Iniquities upon
your dear shoulders if I anv to be rec
ognized the moment I show my face in
London. That Is why I have dyed my
hair, that Is why I ; have abandoned my
role of Ingenue and, altered my - whole
style of dress. Upon my word, Anna,"
she declared, with a strange ; littte
laugh, "you are a thousand times more'
like me as I was two months ago than
I am myself."
A sudden sense of the gravity of this
thing came home to Anna.' Her slsterjs
words were true. They : had changed
identities absolutely. Â¦; It was not for a
week or a month. . It, was forever. \A
cold shiver came 'over her. That' last
year"-in\PÂ»ris, when Annabel and she
had -lived In different worlds, had often
been a nightmare, to her. Annabel had
taken her life into her hands with gay
Insouciance, had made her own friends,
gone her own way. Anna never knew
whither it"had led herâ sometimes she
had fears. ' It . was her past now, not
Annabel's. And somehow she fancied
that .even then the faint smile which
was parting her sister's lips was In
spired by some secret knowledge, some
grimly humorous reflection as to the
nature of that burden which henceforth
was hers. It was absurd to give way to
such phantasies. Nevertheless Anna
bel's smile tortured her.
"It is very good of you to. come and
see me, my dear sister," Annabel re
marked, throwing herself Into a low
chair and clasping her hands over her
head. "To tell you the tnJth, I am fa.
little dull."
"Where^ Is your, husband?" Anna
asked.
"He Is' addressing a meeting of his
constituents somewhere," - Annabel . an
swered. "I do not suppose he wlll.be
home. till late. Tell . me, how are you
amusing "yourself ?"
Anna laughed..;',
"I have been amusing myself up to
now by trying to earn/my living," she
replied. ' . Â¦
"I 'â¢. hope," Annabel answered lazily,
"that you have, succeeded. By the by,
do you want .any money "!; Sir John's
ideas . of pin "money Â¦' are ' not ' exactly
princely, : but I ; , can manage what : you

'.'That's rather a pity," Annabel said.

She would : hot': let her move. She .

' "A thick-set, coarse-looking" young

"It is the same man, Annabel," she ,

face, her voice was thick with sobs.
"Anna, you are the dearest, bravest
sister in the world," she cried. "Oh, I
can't thank you! You dear, dear girl.
Iâ listen." i
They heard a man's voice outside.
'â¢Sir. John!" - Annabel gasped.
Anna sprang to her feet and made
for the dressing-room door.
"One moment, if you please!"
She stopped short and looked around.
Sir John stood upon the threshold.
CHAPTER XIX.
The Discomfiture of Sir John.
Sir John looked from one to" the
others of the two slaters. His face
darkened.
"My arrival appears to be oppor
tune," he said stiffly. "I was hoping
to, be able to secure a few minutes'
conversation with you. Miss Pellissier. ',
Perhaps my wife has already pre
pared you for what I wish to say."*
[ "Not in "the least," Anna answered
calmly. "We have scarcely mentioned
your name."
Sir John coughed. He looked at
Annabel, whose face was buried in
her hands â he looked back at 'Anna,
who was regarding him with an easy
composure which secretly irritated
him.
, "It is concerningâ our future rela

Anna's eyes opened a little wider,
but she said nothing.
"A claim." he continued, "whfch I

She laughed.
"Do you mean to say that you have

"I am afraid that I must confess It,"
he answered. "Idiotic, isn't it?"
"Absolutely," she agreed coldly. "I
wish you would not do it."
""Would not do what?"
"Well, follow omnibuses from Russell

"I can assure you," he answered,
"that it isn't a habit of mine. But se

"Well, seriously?""
"Isn't it your own fault a little? Why
do you not tell me your address and al

"Why should I? I have told you that
I do not wish for acquaintances in Lon

"Perhaps not In a general way," ha
answered calmly. "You are quite right,
I thihk. Only I am not an acquaint
ance at all. I am an old friend, and I
decline to be shelved."
"Would you mind telling me,". Anna
asked, "how long I knew you in Paris?"
He looked at her sideways. There was
nothing to be learned from her face.
"Well," he said slowly, "I had met
you three times before Drummond's
dinner."
"Oh. Drummond's dinner!" she re
peated. "You were there, were you?"
He laughed a little impatiently.
"Isn't that rather a strange question
âunder the circumstances?", he asked
quietly.
Her cheeks flushed a dull red. She
felt that there was a hidden meaning:
under his words. Yet her embarrass
ment was only a passing thing. She
dismissed the whole subject with a lit
tle shrug of the shoulders.
"We are both of us trenching upon
.forbidden ground," she said. "It was
perhaps my fault. You have not for
gotten â "
"I have forgotten nothing," he an

Anna hailed an omnibus. He looked
at her reproachfully. The omnibus,
however, was full. They fell Into step
again. More than ever a sense of con
fusion was upon Ennlson.
"Last time I saw you," he reminded
her, "you spoke, did you not, of obtain
ing some employment in London?"
"Quite true." she answered briskly,
"and thanks. to you I have succeeded."
"Thanks to me." he repeated, puz
zled. "I don't understand."
"No? But it is very simple. It was
you who were so much amazed that I

"At any rate," she declared, "your

THE claim, of the publishers that
"The Historians' History of the
World," forthcoming .In twenty-five
volumes. Is -the most monumental liter
ary landmark of the generation would
seem to be well founded after a reading of
the prospectus issued. The work, which
lsbrought out in this country by the
Outlook Company and in England by
the History, Association, is indeed a re
markable affair since it Incorporates
in Its entirety excerpts from the works
of over two thousand historians of all
ages and all lands, and links together
Into an : encyclopedic whole the record
ot man's activities from Genesis down
â¢to,'*he present day. .
.The forthcoming work ls the outcome
of a movement Inaugurated six years
ago by Henry Smith Williams, LL. *D.,
the English authority upon the art of
history writing, and a coterie of well
versed students of history of Oxford
and Cambridge. Out of the History
Association which was formed by them
there was evolved the Idea of collecting
Into a carefully edited work of cyclo
pedic proportions a consecutive history
"of the :^w'6rld, which should embody
the writings of all authorities, both
contemporary and modern. This idea,
fully developed in the completed plan
of v the publication, Introduces a new
idea in . history writing since it at
tempts nothinsr less than the whole
story of human endeavor, viewed in its
totality. Â¦
â¢ To bridge over the gaps left Inter
posed between the narratives of the
selected historians and to round the
w,hole into something approaching un
ity Henry Smith Williams, the editor
In 'chief of "The Historians' History,"
has associated with himself a staff of
thirty odd European and American
historians of note, whose, task It has
been to serve as compilers, editors and.
In-some cases, translators of the great
mass of material gathered together for
Incorporation in the^ work. When we
consider that the various tongues ren
"dered Into the English range from the
ancient Assyrian to the present-day
Japanese, we may comprehend the diffi
culties attending the production of a
library such as thl3. .

upon stupendous subjects of history
seems to be growing In popularity.
Only. recently we have had the oppor

himself says, no appeal.

By higher hand than mine could ovcrsway.
This certainly goes beyond forgive
ness; It ls a strong symptom of In
firmity of character, at variance with
the delineation Anspacner would con
vey.
Despite his carefully studied â and in
many places carefully imitatedâ verse
form. Anspacher Is guilty of the vio
lation of not a few canons governing
metrical construction. Is It not Pope
In his essay on criticism who inveighs
so strongly against the dodecasyllabic
line In blank verse â a thing -recognized
as a crudity even without his author
ity? Tet there are many such lines
in â¢ Anspacher's poem. The following
example serves to Illustrate the added
fault of coincidence between syllabic
and metric division of words:
I wished for death; X' longed and prayed for
death;
Z t*s la love with death and tried to woo
her *>tL t
Yet despite these and other faulty
constructions and heaviness of verse,
"Tristan and Isolde" contains lines
that ring true with poetic grace. Here
are some coming very near to perfec
tion of concept:
Joy Is a bubblt blows of vanity, ,â¢ â¢

sic Greek idea of the three unities, An
spacher has produced something cu
riously perfect as to fundamentals, but
lacking almost altogether in verve, in
true dramatic richness of motive. The
unity of action he has to secure by
putting all preceding events Into the
mouths of his characters, thus making
of the third act a dreary barren of di
alogue, where the Greek chorus would
have disposed of this element as pre
liminary. 'The unities of time and
of place he has preserved with scru
pulous fidelity. With this done, how
ever, Anspacher has marred, rather
than made his tragedy.
In attributing the fall of Tristan's
knightly honor to a love powder rather
than to the force of fierce passion it
self, the author weakens the strength
of. his tragic uplift by making the hu
man element subservient to the deus
ex machlna â and rather a lame god
at that. Palliation though this may
bring for the sin of the lovers, it les
sens the dramatic force of the tragedy
by much. Again a weakness exhibited
in the culmination of King Mark's
chain of varying sentiment In the plot

My queen to one to whom she had beÂ«n given
tillers of the soil, does Read call at
tention In this book. He outlines the
life of hard, rasping toll, of harsh
physical and moral conditions.. His
hero is one who has to push himself
by hard battling from the place of a
Â¦bonded servant up to independent re
spectability. It Is the sermon of work
that Ls Dreached.-
Because he was "runtish" and gen
erously befreckled, Turkey Egg and
finally Turk was the cognomen sad
dled upon the little waif, orpha'ned
by bloody feud, whose fortunes make
material for the story. Turk becomes
bouna out to a small farmer and by
this new home most of the scene q*
his subsequent life is compassed. The
master is a stranse man â half zealot
and half pessimist â a one-time col
lege professor, whose knowledge has
curdled within him and turned itself
to crall and bitter hatred. A hard
taskmaster is this man and a stern
disciplinarian, but Turk soon learns
that under the outer rind of surliness
lies a iiature of sterling worth. So
when the young servant makes him
self valuable In his master's" eyes ther<s
Is no dearth of opportunity for ad
vancement'in the varying fortunes
offered by the land and the times.
From setting. out tobacco Turk grad
uates Into a mule driver and later to a
lieutenant of a herder, a mate of river
boats, and, finally, a soldier " In the
Confederate forces. The while he has
been a sufferer from the winged
glances of Nan, his master's daughter,
she taunting him beyond a:l .endurance
with her seemingly spiteful enmity.
But, as the reader easily guesses, this
is only girl's play and everything
smiles on Turk, In the end when he
comes home from Imprisonment In a
Federal keep to find opportunity, lying
within reach of his hand in the new
South.
As a reflection of life and manners In
the Kentucky of the fifties Read's book
has Its chief charm. The family cir
cle of ths professor Is admirably
drawn, sufllciently clear in outline to
be taken as typical. The philosophy
of Old Champ, the trapper, as well v as
some of the burning homilies of the
abolitionist preacher, reflect In . large
measure Read's own views of life as
freely expressed In all of his previous
novels. These preachments are solid
with a homely expresion of truth and
love of honest virtues.
Wherein Ople Read's novels fall of
being standard fiction Is readily de
monstrable, with a feature ' In ."Turk"
to bear on the case In point. Along
near the end of the story Read makes
his hero become the legatee of a miser,
who confides in him the secret of his
wealth. In a graveyard, buried under
six feet of earth, will Turk findâ not a
corpse, but a box full of goldâgleam
ing, glittering gold! Let him but dig
that up and he will be wealthy for life.
Now this rank intrusion of the cheap,
ly sensational Into a story that, has to
deal with' sectional color is indicative
of Read's lack of taste, if not clear evi
dence of his pandering to the tastes of
his clientele. They like ! that kind or
incident, and because of that. Read's
books. Even had Read the polished

"The author," according to a frank
foreword, "is perfectly aware of the
fact that the class which sympathizes
with his writing is rather limited; but
he would rather interest the minority
than appeal to the present, taste of ihe
majority." We have here, then, a book
which is in a class by Uself, a sphere
removed from the banalities of our de

JIU GILBERT PARKER. M. P.
statesman and litterateur, has sc
far disentangled himself from
affairs rolitical as to give to the read
ing world ar.other novel, ' the first
since "The lUght of Way." Either
Gilbert^ r>en hand has forgotten
some cf its cunnins or the affairs of
Parliament have been too pressing to
admit of a high literary calm pre
ceding the work of writing, for "The
Ladder of Swords" is distinctly not
up to ttie marl: of thoss stirring- Cana
dian tales upon which Parker rests his
fame. The story is good, but it halts
painfully in the telling.
In Harper's Magazine of October
and November. 1900, there appeared
the shcrt serial, "Angele and Michel."
a tale of two Huguenot refugees at
the court of Elizabeth of England. To
this shorter story of his Parker has
added several chapters, detailing more
at length scenes of court life and pal
ace intrigue, and # rounding out the
smaller production" Into a novel of
regulation length. But largely in this
very adding and embellishment lie the
causes for the limp in ,"A Ladder of
Swords." A long colloquy between
Queen Elizabeth and the heroine in
one instance brings little to the story
besides some preachment of a prosy
order. Again, a chapter devoted to
the interchange of somewhat ponder
ous wit between the Queen's fool and
a boorish seigneur leads nowhere and
smacks suspiciously of padding.
Ar.gele, a beautiful Huguenot
girl, saved from death in Bar
tholomew's massacre, awaits with
her father the turn of events
in the scheduled hiding place of
Jersey Isle. Thither comes her lover
and betrothed, Michel de la Foret, one
of the defeated Camisards of Protes
tant France and the man whose arm
had warded the sword stroke from the
head of his beloved in the wild night
of slaughter. But his arrival at Jer
sey is not before the bluft Seigneur of
Rozel, the friend and cuondam pro
tector of the refugees, has bluntly ad
dressed himself for Angele's hand and

This ; reflection readily assuaged any slight regret I may have
felt at the lack of appreciation I encountered in Mrs. Lacquerre, but
to my surprise.it. did not work a cure in the case of my disappoint
ment, concerning Frances. . v
"I suppose, Reuben," she resumed when she had become more
composed, "you are quizzing F" ranees' mamma to find out why. you
are not strong with Frances. Well, you arc stronger with her 'than;
you deserve. I mean that she sees something in you that I'll be
darned if I see. She thinks you've a temper and a will of your owii,
which ought to make you arrive. To be honest wijh you, I can't
sec through your uncle's chin, and he's a pretty good party at that,
lint for goodness' sake, Reuben, if all you want is adorationâ or what
looks like it â cast your eyes around at some of the other gals. Your
millions arc all they see in you, as a fact, but that's enough to
make them go*o-goo like a flock of adoring sheep. Now, of course,
Frances being the only girl in the bunch who happens not to care for
your money, she is the very one you want to care for you."
"Pardon me again, madam," I replied with dignity, "you as
sume more than my utterances warrant. I did not make a per
sonal application of the lack of a certain appreciative faculty in
Frances."
"Oh, all right," Mrs. Lacquerre responded merrily, ,"we'll make
it impersonal. Frances is like every other woman, in that she cares
for men who do something. She is unlike the other girls down here
at the house parties in not caring for money. Well, there you are;
you, or the impersonal chap you're preaching about, have done noth
ing. The other boys here have. Athletics are the fashion, and they
are up in G right there. I suppose if it were the fashion for gen
tlemen to go "to war, or paint pictures, or press wifd flowers, or ham
ner wrought iron they'd be doing the proper thing. Now, you and
I can be on the level about Frances. I'd like to have you marry
her, because I know your people and because your Uncle Si Js mighty
strong with me â and that's no' joke â and because you've money
enough to take care of Frances without my having to beggar myself
to do it. Now, that's what your Uncle Si would call a black sand
talk, but it won't do you a bit of harm to hear it. If you want to, win
my kid run away and do something. Did you ever hear your Uncle
Silas tell the difference between hunters? He says one kind bring
back the stories and the others bring back the coon skins. Frances
is mighty fond of coon skins. Sure !"
I was as dazed as amazed when I left the lady. Dazed, for, of
course, I could understand but a^ little of her jargon; amazed, be
cause what little I understand seemed to indicate that I belonged to
the class of men who boast of their merit rather than prove it by
action.
I gradually became calmer, for I find it a simple matter to* dis
miss any mental irritation resulting from the discovery of- a slighting
opinion of me. Those who, like me, have acquired merit by pro-
"Pardon me, madam." I exclaimed, amused by the. strangeness
of her figures of speech. "Frances has done nothing to me. , What I
discourse on is rather what she is than what she does. Why, for
example, should a young lady of her high breeding fail to recognize
among the young gentlemen about her those who plainly possess
superior merit? Surely it would be more becoming in her to pay
the tribute of recognition, at least, to, unassuming worth, rather
than applaud the vacant victory of him who can drive a golf ball two
hundred and twenty-five yards and putt it â if my terminology is ac
curate, putt it â fifteen yards. Of what avail is it that, one man
passes laborious days and studious nights grappling with problems
of psychic import if he is, in the company of a Frances, to be,ig
nored for a youth who has just won a tennis tournament, and whose
vocabulary extends but slightly beyond the words 'sure' and
'peach ?' " '
When 1 had finished speaking Mrs. Lacquerre laughed so hear
tily that 1 became alarmed, and even then she only gasped, "Oh, Reu
ben. Reuben, if you must ask me the riddle of a woman's heart try
to talk New Yorkese. Gee, your language counts me out!"
I was equally at a loss to interpret her merriment or her words,
but she came to my assistance.

ihy visit to Mrs. Lacmicrrc's country place I resolved to- concern
myself at once ivii.li those matters of civic activities for which I feel
J am singularly well equipped. 1 shall not conceal that a selfish
motive influenced my resolve. It became evident to me that Miss
3 "ranees Lacquerre was obdurately insensible to my superior merits,
though they must be apparent to her â to any one who has had op
portunity to gauge my capacities. It is of no importance to me, of
course, that she should be unmindful of my worth, for I can in no
manner be affected by her opinion; yet, as a matter of pride, I felt
that she should be forced to recognize the exceptional mental quali
tics \y1iich won for me the oratorical prize at the Sacchrine Academy.
That her opinion of me remained what may be termed, a negli
gible quantity â either favorably or otherwise â became apparent;
and. becoming so, surprised me; and it was on that- account I spoke
of the matter to her mother in a wholly impersonal way. :
"Madam." I said to Mrs. Lacquerre, "has it ever occurred to
you that your daughter lacks in intuitive faculty?"
"What's that kid been doing now?" inquired Mrs. Lacquerre.
I quote her precise language, for, as you arc acquainted with
the lady, you will not be surprised to hear her reported as. using
quaint forms of speech, which, I confess, ..amazed, me, coming from
a leader in New York's most exalted social circle.
"Miss Frances," I explained, "has proved her lack of keen mental
perception through no act. but rather through an attitude."

It was then: I resolved to prove that the intellectual force I had
accumulated could be directed%into a current of active energy as pal
pable as that< physical energy so futile yet so much in vogue in 11 this
Naturally I; turned to politics. Having equipped '< myself ; to en
ter the arena wherein giants contest for supremacy in statesmanship
it seemed, expedient that I should utilize my strength not 'alone for
the good ofmy beloved country, but to prove to one womanâ one
womanâ that the capacity" to use a niblick to negotiate a bad lie in a
bunker is not the ultimate. of consummate achievement. I had, on
one of my evenings of lighter entertainment, met a singularly self
possessed young' gentleman, who, I was informed, was of consid
erable importance in local political circles. I sought this young gen
tleman, Mr. Con Hogan, and disclosed to him my resolve to enter
politics, and ; informed ' him ; that I was .aware of the necessity'a be
ginner had for a. practical manager. Mr. Hogan approved 'my de
cision, buthesitated about accepting the management of my canvass.
"My job," he remarked, "my f special Â¦' graft is preparing candidates
for big office. Isuppose you want, to run for Alderman, for 'the Leg
islature or, at best, for the House of Representatives in Congress., To
the woods with them ! Now if you were a top liner, a mug out for
the real: goods, a.white haired lad who had a, hand and heart out for
a United States Senatorship or the Vice Presidency, why, Con Hogan
would, bring, you to the starter fit to run for ai life. A young fellow,
like you, with your, upper story bulging with 'statesmanship arid
things, ought not to. go to the Alderman's chair; better the electric
chair I You're the kind that butts into the White House, you are.
SayÂ»a Senatorship first, then the Vice Presidency, and having got
your age and weight, to the White House for yours ! I'm sor/y you
insist upon remaining an Alderman ; that's only a starter. I'd like
to help you, but I won't take Presidential timber and whittle it into
a hitching post. Don't ask me. Forget it !"
He was so .indignant that I hastened to assure him that I had
no small aspirations â that even a Senatorship would be scarcely
worth waiting for until I was of proper age. Yet, as it would prob
ably lead to the White House in my case, I would put myself in his
hands,. leave the practical work to him and myself undertake the
congenial task of firing the popular heart and rousing the public
enthusiasm. ]^Xi- * Â¦ v
Mr. Hogan was delighted. He so assured me. "I was afraid,"
said he, "that you might be satisfied with nothing more than the
Governorship. But your looks give me hope. If you're ready to
start at once we'll lay out a programmeâ Alderman, Assemblyman,
State Senator, Vice President, President. What New York City â

after, then a political" night. Then the convention will have to give

With looseness of morals naturally
comes looseness of conversation. The
conversation of many of the "upper
ten", in England at least shows a re
markable tendency towards repulsive
subjects and objectionable details. It
is becoming quite a common thing to
hear "high-bred" men and women
talking about their "Little Marys,", a
phrase which, .though Invented by J.
JI. Barrle, Is hot without considerable
vulgarity and offense. Before the very

portion of the reading public, notably
the upper classes, is toward prurient
literature, they might, were" they less .
honorable and conscientious than they
are, avail themselves financially of
this mc-rbid and depraved taste. Es
pecially as there are a large number of
self-called "stylists" who write reviews
of books and who can always be relied
upon to praise the indecent in litera
ture. They call it "strong," . or
"virile," and reck nothing of the fact
that the "strong" stench of it may
poison previously healthy minds and
corrupt otherwise innocent " souls.
Prurient literature is always a never
failing accompaniment of social
"blight." The fancy for it arises when
wholesome literary fare has become too
simple for the diseased and capricious
moral appetite, and when the Ideal con
ceptions of^ great imaginative minds,
such as the romances of" Scott and
Dickens, are voted as "too long and
boresome!â there's really no time to
read such, stories nowadays!" No â
there is no time. There's plenty of time
to play bridge, though!
Poetryâ the greatest of the arts â Is
absolutely neglected in our present
period, because nobody will read It.
Among the most highly "educated"
persons many can be met who prattle
glibly about Shakespeare, but who
neither know the names of hia plays
nor have read a line of his work. With
the decline of peesy comes as a mat

Is the parent stem from which all these
arts have sprung. The proofs of their
decjine .are visible enough among us
to-day. . Neither Great Britain, nor Eu

great poet. England's last great poet
v/as Tennysonâ since his death we
have, had no other. Equally there Is no
great sculptor, no great painter, no
great architect, no great musician. I
use the word "great,"' of course, in Its
largest sense, in the sense whereof we
speak cf Michael Angelo, Raffaelle, or
Beethoven. There are plenty of clever
â¢'sketchy" artists â "Impressionist"
painters, "rococo" sculptors, and melo
dious drawing-room song r writers â but
we wait in vain for a new "grand"
opera, a nobly Inspired statue, or a
cathedral such as the derout old monks
designed, in the intervals between
prayer and.pr^se. The beautiful and
divine Ideals that made such work pos
sible are, if not quite dead, slowly dy
ing, under the influence of the "blight"
which infects the social atmosphereâ
the blight which is thick with self and
sensualityâ which looms between, man
and his Maker, shutting out every
hopeful glimpse of the sun of faith,
whose life-giving rays invigorate the
soul. And these who see it slowly
darkeningâ those who have been and
are students of history, and are there
by able to recognize Its appearance, its
meaning and its mission, and who
know the mischief wrought by the
poison it exhales, will surely pray for
a storm!
Come but the direst storm and stress that
Fate
Can bring? upon us In Its darkest hour.
Then will the realm awake, however late.
From the -warm sloth In which we yawn and
cower,
And pays our sordid lives In creed, or mat*
With animal delights In luxury's bower:
Then will the ancient virtues bloom anew.
And love of country quench the love of gold;
Then will the mockln* spirits that Imbue
Our dally converse fade like misty cold.
When . the clear sunshine permeates the blue
And men be manly as In the days of old.
And scorn the . base delUhts that sink thsnx
down
Into the languid waters where they drown !
.Yet.it is precisely the poor, > farcical
and -futile "view of life that is ; taken
by thousands of European j and Amer
ican people in- our present period. Both
press and pulpit reflect it; it is.openly
shown in the decadence of the drama,
oC art, of literature, of politics and of
social conduct. The "blight" is over
all./ The blight of atheisrn, infidelity,
callousness and indifference to honor
able principleâ the bHght of moral
cowardice, self-indulgence, vanity and
want of heart. .Without mincing mat
ters, it can be fairly stated that the
"aristocratic" Jezebel isÂ» the fashion
able woman cJL the hour, while the men
vie with one another as to who "shall
best screen her from her amours with
themselves. And so far as the sterner,
Â»exÂ«. are. .personally concerned, -the
moneyed man ia the one moat sought,
after, moist tolerated, most appreciated
and 'flattered in that swarm of drones
called "society" where each buzzing ln-
Fect tries to sting the other, or crawl
over It in euch wise as to ~e the first
to steal whatever honey may be with
in reach. And worst of air things Is
the selfish apathy- which pervades the
majority of the well-to-do classes. As
little sympathy Is shown among them
for the living as regret for the- dead.
The misfortunes of friends are. far
more often made subject for ill-na-"
tured mockery than for compassionâ
the deaths of parents and relations are
uccepted w.ith a kind of dull. pleasure,
as. making way for the 'Inheritance of
money or, estates. No real delight Is
shown in the arts' ''wTiicli foster peace,
progress and Wisdom: and equally lit
tle enthusiasm is btirred for such con
siderations of diplomacy or government
which help to keep nations secure. A
great' man dies one day, and is forgot
ten the next, unless some clumsy and
scandalous "biography" which rakes
up all his faults and mistakes in life,
ar.d publishes private letters 'of th3
most intimate and sacred character,
can La hawked to the front by certain
literary vultures who get their living
table laws, invisible in their working,
but sooner or later made openly manl

surely as night follows day.; If the
retribution, is not of man's makingâ if
human law, often so vicious and one
sided in itself, fails to* give Justice. to
the innocent, then Something or Some
One steps in to 'supply man's '."lock' of
truth and courage, and executes a
Judgment from which there is no.ap

may- not presume to declare â the Ro
mans called it Jove or Jupiter â we call
it God, while denyingr'with-preclsely
the same easy flippancy as the Ro
mans did Just before their downfall,
that such* a"Fdrce" exists. "It "is con

isation. It visited Sodom and Gomor

It is steadily spreading its pall over
Europe and America, Its gloom iis
heavy and pronouncedâ it would sÂ«*em
to be darkening into the true sable
or death color, for there is no light of
faith to iilumine it. . It is the outcome
of the infected breath of peoples who
are deliberately setting God aside out
of their, countings, and living for self
and the hour alone. So called "scien
tists," scraping at the crust covering
of the mine of knowledge, and learning
of its hidden treasure about as much
as might be measured with a' finger
nail, have boldly asserted that .there
is no God, "no Supreme Intelligent
Force back of the universeâ no future
lifeâ nothing but death and destruc
tion for the aspiring, fighting, ivorklng
human soulâ and that, therefore, hav
ing been created out of caprice, . a
"sport" of chance and the elements,
and having nothing to exist for but to
make chance and ' the elements as
agreeable as possible during his brief
conscious experience of them, the best
thing for man to do is to "eat, drink
and be merry all the days of his life,"
though even â¢ this, according to Solo
mon, is "also vanity." For of eating
comes indigestion, of drink stupefac
tion, and of merriment satiety. Strange
it is that if there is 1 no higher destiny
for man than this world and its unss,
he should always be thrown back upon
himself dissatisfied! Give him millions
of money and when he has them hÂ«J
cares little for what they can bring;
grant him unlimited power, and a few
years suffice to weary him of its use.
And stranger still it is to real!z3 that
while those who do not admit God's
existence strut forth like bantams on

PEOPLE who live in the country
know what Is meant by a.
"blight"â a thing which is neither
mist nor etorm, neither cloud
nor rain â a fever "of the atmosphere,
without any freshening or
cleansing force in its com
position. Like a dull stretch of
smoky fog:, it hangs for hours and
often for days over the face Â¦ of the
landscape, poisoning the whalesome
fruit and grain In the orchards" and
fields, and leaving trails of noxious
insect pests behind it upon trees and
flowers, withering their foliage and
blackening all buds of promise with 'a
destroying canker to their very core.
It is suffocating, malodorous I miasma,
clinging to the .air, for which there is
no remedy but a strong, ay*' even a
tempestuous windâ a wind which vig
orously pierces through the humid va
por and disperses it, tearing ,it to
ehreds, and ' finally working 'up such
a storm as shall drown it out of ex
istence in torrents of purifying rain.
Then all nature is relievedâ the air is
clearedâ health and gladness j reassert
their beneficent influences and the land
lies open to renewed life and easy
breathing once more. â¢

had had nothing to eat all day, you
might Ir.deed be downhearted."
"Here Is- a cracker," said Hans. It
â¢was the last one the little boy had. but
he gave it without hesitation to the
hungry squirrel, and, while the squir
rel ate the cracker, they told him their

"Why. that is nothing at all." said the

to make a bridge for you." Thereupon
he began to grow and grow and grow.

Children and Bettina started on their

themselves beside a very wide river,
which they must cross in order to
reach the fairy ring. Here was a^dl
lemma, and they were almost in de
epair when they saw Â¦Â¦Â¦ scjuirrel. He
was chattering verz^ fast, evidently
trying to attract their attention.
-- After a time the old nurse told them
of the plan of the wicked uncle. "But,"
continued she, "whoever stands in that
-fairy ring to-morrow eve is safe from
ell harm. We will start for it early
to-merrow morning."
"Wait a moment," said the old nurse,

Jls oiled hinges, so that it pointed to a
zmountain many miles distant.
Â»' *'Ah," she said, "there it is!" Surely,
'there it wasâ a beautiful green ring.
iThe children clapped their hands with
â¢glee.
In ta-'s castle there once dwelt a little
girl and boy with their uncle, who
v&s their guardian. About half a mil*
from the castle Is a h!yh tower. Up In
the very top of the tower la a little
glass room, and in this room Is a large
telescope. That was a favorite place
for Ears and Gretel to spend their
time, but the old nurse, Bettina, always
went with them. Hans and Gretel were
as happy as the day was Ions', al
though they knew nothing of life out

One day their uncle went off on a
Ion? jciraey. A week later he returned,
brlnslns with him some strange men,
whose rough looks and loud talk
frightened Hans and GreteL But when
their uncle called the children to him
and said, "See what I have brought
you. little ones!" they forgot their
fright in locking at the pretty things
spread out before them. Tor Gretel
there was a beautiful doll and a silk
goTn and for Hans a silver handled
riding whip and bonbons which came
from the wonderful city, many, many
miles distant.
But Bettina, who loved the children
dearly, could not forget the looks erf the
rough men, and when, after the chil
dren had gone to bed, she still heard
the loud talk and the clink of glasses
in the dining hall, she crept down stairs
rery softly, listened at .the door and
heard the wicked uncle planning with
his friends to kill the children and thus
fsaiu all their money and the castle. It
was now Friday, and the wicked deed
was to be done on the following Mon
day.
Sad at heart, the old nurse crept
â¢oftly up the stairs Into the room
Â¦where. In the pure moonlight, Hans and
Gretel lay fast asleep. Bettina opened
the window and looked out. What Joy
filled her heart as she eaw the round,
friendly face of her old friend, the
moon! As his rays shone further and
further Into the little room a plan of
escape began to form in her mind.
'-' The evening of the next day Hans
and Grete! begged to go to the tower,
as usual, and look at the beautiful
landscape by moonlight. So Bettina
wrapped them up wannly, took some
little cakes and a fiask cf wine and
Xhey started.
THERE la an oM castle on thi
Rhine which, like most old aas

credit likewise failed.
SECRET OF IRON CROWN.
Subsequently, when he had con
trived to find means of satisfying both
the powerful assassins and the great
powers of Europe, King Peter made
the unpleasant and belated discovery
that he had no crown wherewith; to
be crowned and no money to cover the
expenses of the coronation ceremony.
He had been under the Impression that
he would be crowned with the crown
which "King Alexander wore, .but It
transpired that . this symbol of regal
authority had been smashed to bits
by the rebel officers on the fatal night
of-June 11, 1903. King Peter had also
been under the impression that the
Servian Legislature would vote the
necessary sum to cover the cost of the
coronation, but he was given to under
stand in terms more forcible than
they were ; loyal and polite that the
elected representatives of the . people
had no Intention whatever of squan
dering national money on the purchase
of such a bauble as a crown or on the
arrangement of costly fetes in honor
of his Majesty's coronation.
A more ludicrous situation never
existed in all history. On the one side
a King pining to be crowned: on the
other side the. Legislature which
summoned him to ascend the throne
refusing to buy him a crown or pay
the expenses of his coronation. In
this extraordinary predicament Â« King
Peter dispatched a personal emissary
to various European capitals to raise
a personal loan which would enable
him to buy a golden crown decorated
with diamonds and to pay the ex
penses of the coronation festivities/
This emissary. Journeyed in succession
to St. Petersburg, ;; Berlin, Brussels,
London, Paris and â¢ Rome, but ; in all
these cities the Â¦. financiers turned '-j |a

of Belgrade was anointing him King
of Servia by divine right. The unfor
tunate King Peter, who like the whole
of Servia suffers from the unbearable
tyranny of the military clique which
murdered* his predecessor, feared to
disobey them and at the same time
was reluctant to offend the great pow
ers of Europe, and to' extricate him
self from the difficulty he postponed
the coronation.

The museum also contains a fine col

An original drawing by Kaiser Wll

The two Governments, however, po
litely informed the Holy Father that
his assistance was neither needed nor
wanted, as both a Roman Catholic and
a Greek Catholic Government had al
ready pledged themselves to carry out
the work.
When the work was about to begin
a letter was received from the Sultan,
who said that as the ruler of several
millions of Christians it was his am
bition to contribute to the rebuilding
of a building In which so many of hia
subjects were interested and, to make
the matter still more complicated, the
Pope, through Cardinal Antonelll, de
clared that he considered it hi* privi
lege to rebuild the dome entirely at
his own expense.
The dome of the Holy Sepulcher was
on the point of tumbling down and
after many Cabinets it was resolved
that France and Russia should rebuild
the dome, each country paying half of
the costs.
Then there is a wooden model of the
Holy Sepulcher to commemorate a dip

PARIS HAS NOW A .
DIPLOMATIC MUSEUM
Servian throne as the result of his pre
decessprts'assassination, ; it has been his
cdnstant endeavor to persuade all" the
monarchs' of Europe to recognize him
as the rightful King of, Servia and as
a . royal sovereign possessing absolute
equality^of rank and dignity with them.
It is his 'especial. desire that the formal
recognition of his claim should be in
dicated through the presence at his
coronation of a member of every royal
family IniEurope. This .would not only
proclaim 'him to all the world as. a
King recognized to be the worthy peer
of the. Kaiser, the Czar and .the other
proud monarchs of Europe, but it would
vastly, increase his prestige among his
own subjects and strengthen his tremb
ling hold on the reins 61 government.
Hitherto the monarchs of Europe
have not shown any inclination to rec
ognize King Peter, as a worthy mem
ber of their exalted order. Although
it has- not been conclusively, proved
that King Peter directly participated
in the conspiracy which, led to the
assassination of King .Alexander and
Queen Draga, there are good grounds
for believing that he was- well aware
of . what, was going' to happen.; The
fact "that the identical officers who
took. the most prominent part in the
actual murder of Alexander and Draga
have been- the most powerful men in
Servia since King Peter's accession
strengthens the grave suspicions. Even
with the support and encouragement
offered to him by the great powers of
Europe, King Peter has been unable
to banish Â¦ the . assassins from his court
or to : dismiss them from their influen
tial ' positions. The Kaiser and the
Czar and other royal personages in
Europe would thus be exposing the
whole- monarchical principle to ridi
cule if. they acknowledged as their
equal a King who ascended to his
throne after participating | In the
assassination of his predecessor. It Is
consequently certain that no great
royal \ personage will be present at
King Peter's coronation, which will be
unique. in this respect.' Â¦ v> j
DECLINED WITH THANKS.
Aware ; of the disgrace which this
circumstance r brings upon him in the
eyes of the , world and of the loss of
prestige which he will suffer In Ser
via, King Peter has , strenuously at
tempted'to soften the hearts of the
inonarchs- of Europe. He" sent his
daughter," Princess Helene. who was
educated under the supervision of her
.mother's", sister, Grand Duchess
!aiilitza,Â»lh St. .Petersburg, to beg the
Czar; to* send /some member of the
Russian-,^ imperial : family, even if It
were the youngest- and most Inslgnifl-
. can't Prince, to represent him at .the
coronation. The Czar refused- and
.Russia will be represented atÂ» the cor
ojiation simply by the -Russian diplo
matic; representative [ at Belgrade.- who
is "quite a subordinate member of .the,
Russian, diplomatic^ service. " ; King
Peter dispatched another special "emis
sary, toj beg ? the . Kaiser Â¦ toj Bend a Ger
man^ Prince i as, his â¢* representative, to
the /coronation,' but, William' II re
fused-even/toVreceive the.: emissary.
Â¦ Smitich. a former Prime Minister of
Servia,^ was : sent !: to. 1 London ' to Â¦ appeal
to*j King* Edward to Â¦ treat King Peter
Even , with this precaution King
Peter has no peace of mind or feeling
of security. His palace is situated a
stone's throw from the. old konak In
which Alexander and . Draga were
murdered, Â¦ and the vicinity is disa
greeable to King Peter. When he
gets up in the morning the konak
catches his eye, reminding him of the
fate which may overtake him. When
distinguished visitors come to his pal
ace he finds their glances wandering
furtively in the direction of the ko
nak . with horror and " aversion. He
cannot leave his palace without driv
ing past the konak and cannot walk In
his own garden except in the konak'a
shadow. During the long, weary
hours of the night the konak appears
to him in nightmares as an appalling
burden slowly crushing him to death.
The konak troubles him so much that
he has ordered it to be] pulled down
r and Hhe. , work of demolition is now
proceeding. In his dreams the King
sees the ghosts of Alexander and
Draga and Draga's brother. Lieuten
ant" Lunjevitza, and the PremierMark
oyitch. -who lost their. lives in' the
fatal night at the konak. hovering
around him with undying . hatred and
1 horrible . menace imprinted on. their
ethereal features. Peter made a sorry
bargain when he exchanged his peace
ful exile^ in free , Switzerland for- the
Â¦wobbling throne of Servia. The crown
which he ' strove to wriest from the
Obrenoyitches for so many long years
has brought him neither happiness
It is' not only the contemptuous hos
"lility of the great powers of Europe
that makes King. Peter unhappy on the
Servian throne. Ever since his arrival
In Belgrade a few days after the mur
der of his predecessor he himself has
lived in mortal terror of assassination.
Hitherto every single Prince and King
who has occupied the Servian throne
has either been assassinated or driven
into exile after a compulsory abdica
tion, and King Peter has every reason
to fear that he will be no exception to
this rule. He Is well aware that the
officers who killed King Alexander and
summoned him to the throne would
not hesitate to murder him in precisely
the same way if he ceased to be their
tool. He is merely the caricature of a
King sitting on the blood-stained
throne simply to carry out the win of
this group of murderous military dlc
tatorsr whose unbearable tyranny has
alienated the masses .of the people to
such an extent-that one or the other
malcontent, burning with his .own and
others' wrongs, is likely to terminate
the national misery by putting a bullet
through King Peter's royal body.
King Peter has wisely intrusted his
personal safety not to Servians, but to
foreigners. Immediately after his ac
cession to the throne he formed a body
guard composed of men who have
served In the Swiss army, and he sur
rounds himself with his Swiss protect
ors day and" night. "When he makes a
Journey through his dominions the
Swjss bodyguard accompanies him to
keep his loving subjects at a safe dis
tance. When he drives out In the
streets of Belgrade the Swiss .body
guard surrounds his carriage. During
the daytime the Swiss bodyguard sup
plies'the sentries standing around the
royal palace, and at night they hold
the palace and approaches thereto in
force. 'so as to prevent the repetition of
such a treacherous attack as ended
Alexander's reign.
HAUNTED BY GHOSTS.
FEAR OF ASSASSINATION.
Another appeal addressed to the aged
and benevolent Emperor of Austria
elicited the emphatic reply that the
honor of the house of Hapsburg could
not be soiled by the presence of one of
Its members at the coronation of a
King whose hands are stained with
blood. . Rebuffed and rebuked on all
sides, King Peter cannot contemplate
his coronation in a happy frame of
mind.
less harshly than the other monarchs.
The English Government gave Mr.
Simitch clearly to understand that it
was quite out of the question for any
Prince of the royal blood to represent
England at â¢ the coronation. He was
further informed that King Edward
and the English Government regarded
King Peter's subservience to King
Alexander's assassins with such con
tempt and suspicion that England
would refuse to have any diplomatic
Intercourse whatever with Servia un

LONDON. Sept. 17.â The growing
fashion among women of the smart set
of carrying to church prayer books in
bindings to match their dresses has
shocked Archdeacon Diggle of Bir
mingham, who *has been denouncing
from the pulpit women for their friv
olity and Irrellgion. The archdeaconal
dismay isn't shared in Paternoster row,
which is the home of the prayer book.
On inquiry there as to the custom it
was ascertained that no less a person
than an Anglican Bishop had ordered
for his daughter a cream-lxymid praye?
book with silver clasps and monogram
in silver. It was a white prayer book
which first was introduced primarily
for the use of brides and bridesmaids.
The custom, it may be said, borrowed
not long ago from America, rapidly de
veloped into the colored prayer book.
A "West End dressmaker consulted on
th'e subject said the custom had found
great favor among the smart set and
had come to stay. Archbishops and
archdeacon notwithstanding.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. SEPTEMBER IS, 190*.
18mtzl Scheff Is a little bit mystlfled
at times by the idiosyncrasies of tho
American brand of humor. A member
of her business staff told her a story
the other day of a rich American un
used to high society who was being
entertained at dinner In the house of
an English earl. It was one of those
stories that are funny to the acute
American mind because of their whim
sicality and utter lack of point This
story went on that when the Ameri
can was handed a lettuce salad he
took ; some of Â« the leaves and rubbed
them on his head. Of course there was
consternation among the other guests,
poorly hidden by the charity of good
manners. One of the serving mefl who
could not contain himself said: "I
beg your pardon, sir, but that was let
tuce-salad."
"Oh," replied the American, ""I
thought It was spinach."-
Frltzl didn't Iaush but knit her
brows and after a moment's hard
thinking said: "But people don't rub

those that do not she is a Canadian
child that 'came here* some six or
seven years ago with a tiny fiddle
tucked under her arm and much
music in her heart. Five years and a
half arro she went to Henry Holmes,
who has ever since taught her for Jhe
love of God and music- â all honor to
him. Under his care the little girl
has flowered naturally into a gracious
young artist, with an excellent style,
an astonishingly mature tone and an
extraordinary technical' facility. She
has a repertoire that include*! â well, I

From the neglectful Wagner, we got
back to the Amsterdam Opera-house
and then, casually, Miss Francisca re
marked that Queen Wllhelmina is be
ginning to take interest In the national
music.
"As refuge from â **
"Ah, those are all lies," the singer
interrupted. "Queen Wllhelmlna's hus
band Is the most charming man Imag
inable. They are perfectly happy to
gether. I -have sung at the palace fre
quentlyâboth at The* Hague and the
Looâ and they seemed always to be en
tirely happy. Yes. The Queenâ she's
not very musical, but very intelligentâ'
asked me about a singing method. I
am, you know, a Marchesi pupil, and,
of course, recommended her. She liked
It and wrote to thank me afterward."
"With whom did you study here. Miss
Francisca?"
"With old Madame Fabbri,".she re
plied, "but not for very long. After
ward a little in New YoTk and then
Paris and Marchesi."
"Your tone tells. me what you think
of Marchesi," I said here". It was like
Mr. Bellew's when he speaks' of Mrs.
Potter. . â¢
"One can only speak of people as one
finds them," the singer said, with her
gentle sweetness. "Marchesi was like
a mother to me."
"Arid she is th# best teacher in all the
world?"
"For me," Francisca sweetly insisted.
"I know many American girls go over
there and do. not like her. But they
are the kind that are trying to become
prima donnas and have a good time at
the same time. You cannot do that,
you know. I was with Marchesi | for
three years and a half and it was Just
that much of steady Inspiration. Let
me show you her photograph," and
once again I had the pleasure of look

twenty or twenty-five minutesâ she. is

"And for this how much?"
"For this, twice a week, it is Just
about 200 francs."
"Should | you advise an American girl
to study. In Paris?"
"Not if," Francisca said, with more
emphasis than she had yet permitted
to appear above the soft surface of
her manner, "not If she can remain at
home and find a good husband. The
life, after you have won your way,- la
so hard, and it is ;' so hard to win .that

"Oh, always," she answered me.
"Mozart in Dutch seems odd, n'est-ce
pas? And the language is not so nice
to sing in. It is guttural, rather harsh.
But everything, Wagner, French opera,
Italian, Is given In the native tongue."
"How long is your season?"
"Eight months," replied the singer.
"Darling" â this |s to Romeo, again In
noisy evidence, "you are a spoiled
baby, be quiet Isn't he pretty?"
Mrs. Campbell had invited me to pre
varication before on the same score.
So had others. So joyfully, with the
fluency of long experience, I dubbed
the no-tailed, pug-nosed, Afrikander
black little beast the most beautiful of
its sex. Miss Francisca wasted a ten
der satisfied pat on his pink bow, and
then returned to Amsterdam.
She told me that they have there a
season of eight months of grand opera
at the Royal Opera-house, every year.
There are fifty-four men in the orches
tra. There is a tremendous chorus.
They sing every evening â no matinees
â and sometimes change the bill every
night. Miss Francisca herself has
sung â on an occasion when a singer
engaged to alternate with her did not
please, ver^r prettily she put it, "my
friends did not enjoy her so well as
me"â no fewer than twenty-four times
in one month. Six times a week she has
sung not infrequently. The" repertoire
includes all schools, with a special eye
to the possible modern masterpiece.
"Zaza," Francisca tells me, is a great
favorite with the Amsterdam burghers.
I didn't mind that. "Andre Chenier,"
too, is warmly approved. The dictum
had for me the flattery of agreement.
But when I heard of their "Falstaff,"
their "Hamlet," "Herodiade," "Sapho,"
"Louise," and so on, of an opera of last
year "La Princesse d'Auberge," by a
person named Blockx, who has the im
pertinence to be and write stuff that'
people listened to for fifty-four night*
In one season, and never an echo of it
or him to reagh here â well, I felt then
that we were a long way oft from
things.
"And they are really musical, your
Amsterdam folk?" I asked.
"Very musical," Miss Francisca
testified. "You will hear your butch
er and your, baker come up the steps
whistling bits of 'Die Meistersinger,'
'Carmen,' all the operas. It is so pret
ty much all over the Continent. You
see, the theater entrance fee Is so
cheap. For 25 cents you can get a
good enough seat, and everybody
roea,"
Rather ruefully I said: "I've heard
our garbage men tooting 'Trovatore'
and Traviata' and" â I straightened
up then to the faith of California â
"we're going to make-'em here. Miss
Francisca."
Gently amused she looked, but del
icately courteous if a little doubtful
of her native State, asked: "You have
much music?"
I reminded her that mansions
where before there were sand dunes
was not the only change that twelve
years had brought; told her some
thing of the glories of our last musi
cal season, and of the art leaven in the
atmosphere. It was not pleasant to
confess that California, mother of
much genius, was chary of reward to
it In its bloom. "You are at home in
Amsterdam," I concluded. â¢
At my inquiries as to her prefer
ence in parts, Francisca had to hesi
tate for a moment, "I like so many
roles," she began, "that one best .usu
ally that I am singing. , I have had a
good deal of success as Santuzza â "
"But I thought you were a lyric so-
prano?"
"I have a rather useful dramatic
quality also," the. singer .explained.
"Still, I am a colorature singer. Vo
cally I suppose my best roles are such
as Lucia and Gilda. , But I have had
much success with La. Tosca, Zaza,
Sapho-7-the Massenet, you knowâ a
little Wagner, also."
"And whar of Wagner ?"Â«
"Elsa, Eva and very, very \ often I
have sung Vehus in â¢ the 'Tannhau
ser,'" she . replied. -Wagner, I .am
sure, would have mended his ; man

actress has developed new resources.
There is both passion and poetry in her
Marta. Possibly more horror, , hardlx
more pathos, could be got out of the
little tale of Marta's dying mother, for
exampleâ the sightless beggar holding
out her hand almsward all day, and
awfully In her sleep at night; then as
she lay dead putting her .hand out so,
as If she were asking something in the
other world. I want no more haunt
ing picture of a beggar, nor would I
care for a more piteous suggestion than
Miss Roberts gives. Not at the Homeric
level of passion that Bosworth reaches
as Mannelich does Miss Roberts tftad.
But she strikes a true, full note, and
the gentle sadness that she excels in
depicting is in much needed evidence.
Little Ollie Cooper has the child's
part, and a wonderful youngster she is.
Take away a Market street tang from
the young lady's diction, and I do not
see where the Nuri could be improved.
But these, and the Vierge-like figure of
the old man, Tomas, done capitally by
William Yerance, are almost only back
ground to the big "blond beast,"
Mannelich,^ gentle goatherd and wolf
killer, friend of children and slayer of
his wife's betrayer. And here Is where
Hobart Bosworth comes in.
The more I see of Bosworth the less
I understand him. I do not understand
how the man that made a painted plas

the passionate abandon, that Mr. Bos

He seems a creature of the primeval

two-bits up we all , listened to the
laughter of the glorious youthâ boyish,
divinely foolish, yet .laughed with not

longings like the mountains shook at

Â¦warrant for another lapse into pro
vincial patriotic^. Miss Francisca, once
Fannie Michelson of San Francisco,
dune home last week after an absence
of twelve years. She went away an
inconsiderable amateur; she returns
from a prima donna reign of three
years at the Royal Opera-house in Am
sterdam. Paris has sanctioned her.
Berlin has approved her. Now only
remains for the Californian to "make
pood" at home.
Not always does this happen. - We
have here a wayward fashion cf dis
regarding the Paris or any other ca
chet. Belike, like Chinese tea, they
lope flavor In crossing the ocean. Still
more likely we are gloriously uncon
scious of them. It is so In Miss Fran
cisca/s case. Not until the singer made
up her mind to slip a season in Am
sterdam In order to sing a little so
prano at home did one hear that she
had won renown In Parts. Not until
then was it considered essential that
we should know of her triumphs In
Deutschland, so not by these achieve
ments, but by her "Lakme," "Mlg
ron" and the rest â¢ of her pro-
Kr&rasies of next week will she be
Judged. I venture to prophesy the
Judgment favorable, at least vocally.
TTlthln the range of the speaking voloe
I have heard no more charming note
than that of Miss Francisca. Honey,
the liquid, aching 6wee"t of the flute,
the plaintive clutch of- the oboe â dear
me, I do hope 6he singsâ are all hers
fcr the use. Three years and a half
with Madame MarchesI, as the Cali
fornian was fortunate enough to have,
should, however, insure at least some
control of her resources. They have In
sured an exquislteness of enunciation,
a beauty of pronunciation, that makes
even Frandsca's "how-dye-do" a delight
to hear. Temperamentally, of course,
one cannot yet venture to catalogue
the singer. I found her In my chatting
exploration this week, a woman of ex
ceptional charm, of soft, unconscious
coquetries of expression, of gentle and
irraclous mannerâ above all, a woman
of the world.
Miss Francisca was "at home" to
me In a comfortable flat en O'Farrell
street. A rather small woman, round
ly made and with "Paris" stamped all
over her gown, it was that met me. Her
"hrw-dye-do" was as foreign as Sem
brloh'c The dog barking at her heels
was as tlnily absurd as the usual prima
donna dog. Her hair was â generally
is. I should say â the conventional pri
ma donna gold. And she Is the usual
j.rSma donna age, you know it for your
self.
You would not at first call Francisca
pretty. Nor is she by any law. Tet
one lies In wait for expressions, a pi-
Quant arch of the right eyebrow, the
shutting in laughter of the bright
brewn eyes â the left with a delicate
Japanese slant, a characteristic moue.
snd one is momentarily under the il
lusion of beauty. Add the voice, the
"imaging little foreign stutter and ac
cent and one capitulates completely.
I rather hoped Miss Francisca would
not pay that she was glad to come
home â twelve yeare, it Is so long. But
Fhe did. She said that she found the
place transformed. She said it was the
most beautiful city she had ever been
in, and that she had traveled much.
There were raptures for Golden Gate
Park, with its four miles of loveliness,
ending in the climacteric splendor of the
ocean. There was appreciation for the
n^w ancestral castles of Pacific avenue.
Above all. there was delight In her Cal
ifornian welcome.
"And how long are you going to en-
Joy these things?" I asked.
"Oh, Indefinitely," said the singer. "I
have tried to get home many times,
and, now I am here, I shall not hurry
back. Couche-toi, vite!" this to the dog
Jumping about and barking an accom
paniment. "Romeo" speaks only
French. "I 6hall not be bo very long In
California, but my concert tour will last
for some time. I sing all the way from
here to the East."
"1 hoped to hear yon In operaâ'*
"I am desolee â desperated" â the sing
er laughed et her tongue's entangle
ment in her home speech â "in despair,
I mean, that I cannot sing in opera
fcere. I love to play. One can give
themselves so much more In playing.
And this year, of all years, they tell me
that the Tivoll has no grand opera sea
son. Why, oh, why must this be?"
"Jest because you were coming
home." I laughed. "I fancy, though. It
was really because Mr. Leahy thought
that If we went hungry for a season
we Â«honld better appreciate the rare
â¢tuff the Tivoll provides."
"But this year," the singer pouted,
and I felt somehow personally respon
sible as that piquant, protesting right
eyebrow went up. She went on: "And
tfcey tell me that they do such good
things there." ; "-
I did my little usual best here aa

"But, why," asked Miss Francises,
"do they not. Instead of bringing over
the Italians, give grand opera In Eng
lish, say with the people they have
now, and perhaps engage an extra
elnger now and then for particular
parts, as Henry Savage does? It would
be of tremendous value to the Ameri
can singers, for Savage cannot engage
them all."
An-1 madame tighed still more deep
ly. I asked her then what of the
Amsterdam grand opera. Did they
give it in Dutch?
"I'm wondering how the Savage
Brand opera comparea with ours"â I
began. "After all, the opera Is not a
missionary enterprise, though that
Â¦would be an admirable end of it." I
told Miss Francisca then of the truly

Manchester Benefits at Expense* of
Seaport by Change in Con

. LONDON. Sept. 17.â Liverpool com
plains bitterly that Uncle Sam has
taken aide with Manchester in a curi
ous struggle for shipping between tha
two cities. Under a recent change In
the American consular district the
Â¦w4w>Ie of the ship canal Is given to
Manchester, and Liverpool loses, fur
thermore, the important towns of
SouthporV Preston. Blackpool. Lan
caster and Barrow.
This means that the ' amount of
Liverpool shipping in the next year's
statistics yrtl\ show a considerable fall
ing, off, though, of course, it doesn't
affect the actual commerce of that
port. "Whenever and ; however this
most sinister attempt to* filch business
away from Liverpool has originate?!
doesn't particularly concern us." says
the Liverpool Post. "It is sufficient to
know that an attempt has been made,
and apparently for a short time has
succeeded, but it is hardly conceivable
that American Interests, which are
now threatened, will be content to ac
cept a regulation which obviously
threatens their well being to an extent
which may not appear on the surface
but which Is latent."
Liverpool fondly hopes the shipping
combine will become Its ally against
growing and greedy Manchester.

besides a host of other pretty maids
and matrons in white frocks. During

filled the airâ they were simple songs
of the little orphans, some wistful, some
timid, some radiant, but all happy, ac

The A. E. Wellingtons have re
turned to San Francisco after a sum
mer in Ross.
The Arthur Pages are among, the
many who, loth to relinquish the Joys
of the country for the hum of the city,
are still lingering in San Rafael.
Not long ago the Italian-Swiss col

the engagement and subsequent mar
riage of two of its well-known young
people â Miss -Sartori and Mr. Sbar

The Charles Josselyns are preparing
for an active social winter. What else,
indeed, with two charming daughters!
The young women, Miss Gertrude
particularly, attracted a vast amount
of attention In Paris.
Both the maids have a style that
stamps them with individuality.
Mrs. A. W. Scott, the prominent
clubwoman, won renewed laurels dur
ing the Knights Templar receptions,
filling her duties on the reception
committees with charming tact. Many
of Mrs. Scott's gowns were, exquisite
affairs, a white Cluny lace robe win
ning much favor.
Another ball looms up on the social
horizon, the "coming out" ball of
pretty Miss Elsa Draper.
Mrs. T. W. M, Draper has taken a
house on Pacific avenue which will no
doubt swing wide Its doors this win
ter for affairs in honor of the younsr
daughter of the house.
The Sequoia Club opened Its new
headquarters at the St. Francis on
Thursday night, but without flourish
of trumpets. A suspicion had gone
abroad, shared in by Sally Sharp, and
others, that an informal reception
would be held on that date. But the
Information was Irrelevant, incom
petent and immaterial and no cele
bration marked the acquisition of the
club's home, but on Friday, the 23d.
there will be a gathering of the club
members to celebrate properly the
auspicious event of housekeeping.
The waiting list of the club is some
what lengthy, but a cautious board of
directors can be depended upon not to
enlarge the club list unwarrantably.
A lot of clever and interesting men
are in the club, likewise many clever
and Interesting and not unpretty
women. '. iVv
Who know* what sociological prob
lems the club may solve? There's the
men's club question, the women's
club question and not the least inter
esting, the Platonic friendship ques
tion. And in these days of Ibsenlsm
social investigations are eminently
smart.
The coming of Maurice F. Loewen
stein from out of the Orient to claim
his bride, Miss Anna Sutro, has been
the occasion of much congratulation.
The St. Louis Fair is calling!
Whether the voice Issues from the
Pike, from the Palace of Agriculture
or from the Temple of Art there is no
direct evidence at hand â except that
based on precedent. And that would
directly establish the Pike as the most
persistently visited department in. the
frreat show. But it is not defensible â
Midways and Pikes always need de
fenses, and they always draw the big
gest crowds â that the Pike is inter
esting, not so much from its risque
expositions of things, but because It
affords a common habitat for the
divergent members of the family of
man. There are gathered here within
these few acres brown men, "red men
and black men from the remote cor
ners of the earth; all living nearly as
they live on their native heath, and
following mod,es and standards of
livin r almost unknown to all of
which is famously interesting to an
observer who observes, and Infinitely
more profitable than the printed page
can possibly be.
Thus go forth and fear not, ye
righteous ones. The Pike is an edu
cating factor â and therefore wholly
respectable.
But to be consistent, and the world
loves consistency, it would ')e well to
ray a serious visit to the great temples
of industry and development. While
not showing their wares to the allur
ing "cymbals and sounding brass" â
except, perhaps in Machinery Hall â
there is much to see and much to
learn. And the greatest truth to be
learned is how wonderfully the world
Is progressing in all the arts of living.
It will be interesting to hear the
verdict of the smart set folk who will
eoon be setting their faces toward the
East, many of whom, however, will
not return till the winter season will
have begun. But even then, their con
ception of the big fair will furnish a
sane topic for conversation â which in
itself is a thing devoutly to bÂ» wished.
Among those whose plans are to
start SL Louisward soon are: Mrs.
Linda H. Bryan, chaperoning Miss
Georgie Spieker and Miss Mabel Toy;
Major and Mrs. Krautkoff, Mr. and
Mrs. Samuel Buckbee, Mr. and Mrs.
Aurelius Buckingham. Dr. and Mrs.
William Hopkins, Mrs. Alfred Hunter
Vcorhies, Grantland Voorhies, Mr. and
Mrs. Philip E. Bowles, Mr. and Mrs.
Byron Jackson, Mr. and Mrs. Robert

Harry Tevis in his private car; Mrs.

Dr. Buckley and the Misses Buckley,
Mr. and Mrs. Kirkham Wright and
the Misses Jeannette and Marian, Mr.
and Mrs. H. M. A. Miller; Mrs. H. H.
Beldin and Miss Nadine Belden. who
proceed on their way to Europe; Miss
Virginia Lewis, Mrs. Samuel F. Leib.
Mrs. Arthur Cornwall, Major Steven
son and the Misses Stevenson, the lat
ter to remain in the East through the
winter â and a host of others â but
memory hath its limitations.
The month of O*ctober will be Cali
fornia's month to shine at the. fair.
And what a sensation her daughters
cause In the East! Say what you will,
there is not in the West the attention
given her women that is theirs in the
East. The reason? Because they are
different, perhaps.
Quite an awakening In the smart
set! On Monday Mr. and Mrs. Tim
othy Hopkins opened the week with
a dinner at. the St. Francis, Mr. and
Mrs. Frederick Kohl the guests of
honor.
In appointments the dinner was the
smartest affair of the early season.
In the array of gowns and of Jewels
displayed It was said to be a visual
feast- But why not? Are not the
smart women of the West as smart as
the women of the East, arid as rich?
Then why shouldn't they robe them
selves In the fetchingest fashion and
lay jewels on their breasts and brows?
For they wear them well, so say al!
who have seen and know. Amon? the
guests at the dinner were Mrs. Fred

difficulty in the matter of holding up
some of the regimental warrants. Col
onel Thomas F. O'Xeil, commanding
the regiment, is having about as much
to look after as any one Commanding
officer cares to have at one time, yet
on top of that there is the approaching
election for the colonelcy of the regi
ment. The colonel declines at this
time to state whether he will be a can
didate or not for re-election. Yet,
v.hlle he is undecided, there are Indi
cations that should he decide to run

If the Korea is on this coast, what is her purpose? American
e2agrar:rr:ty is disturbed by some comments of the Russian press.
The Novoe Vrcmya said that the corning of the Lena had served
notice on the American contrabandists that had made them turn
pale asd that it proved that "the slightest Russian success roused
tfcs apprehension of the world." Indeed ! The coming of the Lena,
her disarmament in a, neutral port and paroling her officers and
crew, is called a success that makes the knees of the world knock
together and its-teeth to chatter like a castanet! What the Xovoe
Vremya calls the, American. contrabandists will take a contract to
outfoot the Lena on deep water, under saiL with steam off, while
one cf cur great liners could probably ram her amidships , and
sink her before she could hit it with a* shell, unless her gunners
are better than any that have been waiting powder oa the fieets
of Togo and Kamimura. -
When the warship r of a belligerent seeks refuge and asylum
in a nectral port, begging to overstay the time limit, it is' not
usual for the press of the belligerent to abuse the friendly neutral
that oSers the asylum, nor accuse its nationals of being- white with
abject fear of the belEgerent ship. Russians must Judge for them
selves the" kind of taste they show in such matters, but as for
American sentiment, it will not be improved in its svrapathr for
Russia'bv such bombastic tactics.
IT F :hÂ«r report prove true that the Russian cruiser Korea i<* on the
9 northern cxiast, it is to be hoped that she is not making" for
. this or any other port in the United States. The object of the
presence here of the Lena is not ye\ explained. Neither her officers
nor the consular or diplomatic representatives of Rcssia have done
their dr^v by telling why she came. Her presence is an annoyance
that our Government has endured and disposed of. If another
Russian warship -appear in one of our ports the annoyance will'
degenerate into an affront.

WAR SHOTS.
npKE helpfulness of a college education has been, m a certain
sense, on trial in, this country. In the ranks of the successiut
* den curing the last half century has been an appreciable per
centage cf individuals who have achieved extreme material success
v.ithout the aid of such education. Many of these have expressed
themselves on the subject, indicating a belief that higher education
is unnecessary to achievement. On the other hand, many such men
have teitiSed" to their faith in education -by giving lavishly of their
substance to endow and maintain institutions of learning. _Such
giirs have, in this country, reached a colossal volume. The giving of
them must mean that the givers believe education to be an advan
tage, for they surely r.-orrld no: sfefc to endow that which is a dis
advantage to" their countrymen. Senator Stanford had an academic
education and was so convince*! of its benefits that he gave the great
est individual endowment to learning in the history oi the world.
Perhaps a common viewpoint from, which to estimate the benefits
of education may.be reached by accepting the Splendid epigram of
President Jordan, who says that the great need of 1 the world is for
men who kno-v that "a straight line is the shortest distance between
two points." The man who" knows that, and applies the knowledge
to practical affairs succeeds prfeen the one who does not know it fails.
It :s the business of education-to teach men that a straight' line is the
shortest distance between two points. A few men find this out
ttithout the help of education, but the many reach that â¢knowledge
through education alone. Therefore, the more educated .men we
have the more successful men we will have. Again, success does not
mean the making of millions. It means* ability to get a competence
bv steadfast application and in getting it to do sorftthing for the
vv'orld. What the country needs is not less but more of the college
spirit. It is needed in business, in politics, in society. It means self
respect and respect for the rights of others and a regard for the law
and its .equal and impartial application. Sp^S ' .. : ;^i
Dreamers may cry out against seeking the materialities of life and
against pursuing fortune. But En spite of it all the master motive of
men wiL! be a desire for ownership and a high purpose to found and
properlv maintain a home. That these aspirations are inspired by
education there is abundant evidence, though they exist without it.
The college spirit has another function in the general uplifCof so
cictv. It reaches out the helping hand to those beyond its tr.vn guild.
We see this in the increasing number of university settlements in
ssxb localities in cities as need to know what colleges know about the
ocrmmon things of life that enter Into its strength and duration.
Among these are proper sanitation, household economy, the best and
most economical diet and the best modes of its preparation, the most
useful employment of leisure from toil, and the expenditure of earn
ings so as .to get the most and the best out of them. It is readily
seen that these things go to the advancement of the whole body of
>ociety and to the rise of a spirit of brotherhood as against class
enmity. While a whole community cannot receive t college educa
tion in these ways it may receive the college spirit.
In his address to the students of Berkeley Secretary Shaw uttered
some homely and wholesome truths. He said : "li you go out to fail
ure it is not for want of knowledge, but for lack of education/*
Knowledge is the tool. Education is aptness in Its use. The Sec
retary declared that : "If you can set your mind working and keep It
working until you tell it to quit you are prettv well educated-. The
university is the best place In the world to. start an education. A<
good share qf the work in the world has been called drudgery. But J
men who have succeeded have not regarded work as drudgrerv. '
Young men. do not work for hire. By that I do not mean not to
work for a salary, but work for the accomplishment of some thing.
If you go out as a lawyer do not take a case for the fee. I don't mean
that you are to refuse a fee for your services, bet work to accom
plish something. There are pleniy of opportunities for young- men at
the present day. All you have to do is- to do something better than
it has been done before. If I were asked to name the current weak
ness among young men I would say It is the want of self-reiiance.
Tfae world will pay any price for excellence. If you do the thing up
to the highest standard you .need not fear for the future. I want to
congratulate you upon going out into the best world that was ever
known, to honor vonrselves and the institution that has equipped
yon for its duties." â¢ $&%
The influence upon students of such addresses by men whose career
entitles them to a hearing and qualifies them for advice Is not to be
overestimated. We take it that me first thing to get out of the
heads of students is the idea that a college education works automa
tically and is a substitute for the personal equation for energv and
enterprise. It is merely a training for the best use of these and for
making their use consist with morality and respect for th? rights of

GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROVIDE BREAD FOR THE POOR, SAYS SANGIORGI
/^faifljw'HE report for 1903 of the Na
f - i tional CommlsElcner of Edu-
HL 1 cation makes clear the re-
maskable growth of the col.-
lego ard university interests
In this country. Mention is
made In this report of 63S Institutions,
Â¦which are classed as technical schools,
colleges and universities, with an ag
gregate iUlendancc of 107.00 students.
Of ihis number 66,000 men 'and 22.000
wompn were in the higher institutions
for men and for both sexes. 55D0 were in
colleges for women and 12,000 men and
1200 women, attended the technical
school*. In the twelve preceding years
the men students had increased from
45.000 . to 78.000. and the women from
11,000 to 2S.O00. Nearly half of. the whole
number of 107,000 were engaged in, clas
sical etudieA and over 14.000 in general
culture course?.
Grcat efforts are being made in the
State of North Carolina in behalf of
fomnon school education. The educa
tional wants of that State are numer
ous and urgent. North Carolina has a
total population of 1.8S4.O0O, of which 82
jsrr cent Is rural and agricultural. One
tblrd of the population is composed of
respect as the" second , in the Union,
having 54,000 white voters who can
neither read nor write. After 1908
no North CaroJina man who becomes
21 years old can vote unless he has
acquired, these qualifications.
. But there are brighter arospects in
store for this State. During the . last
few years Governor Aycock and 'the
educators of the State have worked
IncessanUy to arouse the' public mind
to : the imperative need of leducational
improvement. As a result of these
strenuous exertions local, taxation is
more frequently imposed;' school.dis
tricts are. beihgjcohaolidaied and finer
buildings are being erected; salaries
of teachers and superintendents are
gradually increasing, especially, in the
cities, and schdol. libraries \are -being
established/ An law .took
effect in' 1903 by . which . the State
loaned $200,000 at : 4 per cent inter
est to school districts f ot new school
buildings, .one-tenth of each loan; and
the interest -.being 'payable -annually.
The .plans of all. Bchoolhouses hereaf
ter built -must be approved by the
State' Superintendent. Other favoring
a^enclesiare the State College of Ag
riculture! the State Normal and In
dustrial College and the. State Uni
versity, which are sustaining the ed-
colored people. The school enrollment
of white children is 315.000 and of col
ored children 150,000. While the amount
expended for the instruction of each
enrolled rhlld in North Carolina is only
$3 17. the average sum paid for each
child in the United States is $20 29. "
Among the obstacles to educational
progress may be mentioned the physi
cal features of the State, with its ex
tensive swanTpfl of the east and. the
mountainous ranges of the west, which
allow only small schools, in many
places. Extreme poverty, of the coun
try'people has operated thus far against
liberal local taxation for their schools,
local taxation* being optional. The
school days in ( a whole year are, only
eighty-two.
Teachers' salaries are small. The
average white teacher receives but
$26 7S per month for., four months.
School supervision is also.poorly paid:
Forty cpunties exit of Â»: ninety-seven
pay their superintendents less than
$400 per annum. .School buildings are
inferior and .are often lacking. Out
of 5700. white school districts, 484
have rude log houses, while C 2 5' dis
trict* have no . public schodlhouses
whatever. Illiteracy is widely preva
lent and North Carolina has the de
plorable distinction of ranking in this
jucatlonal advance with every resource
at* their command.
Los Angeles engages 100 more
teachers than last year. Temporary
buildings have been erected in several
parts of the city, and two ten-room
structures are nearly finished'. City

I think we are going out with a better
understanding that if we are to follow
Jesus in helpfulness it must cost us
something. Did not Jesus let the subtle
essence of his virtue flow to those who
needed It, regardless of the exhaustion
to himself? And in this imitation shall
we not come so near and so connect
with the dynamo of his own great
heart that all our little storage bat
teries will continually be replenished
from his own fullness?

than ever to help the lowly and suffer

success. I believe there is no better,
way to present the, advantages of a
city or to awaken ' the Interest of
strangers In it, and I am delighted to
see what a success you are/ making
of it."
N. Walter Macintyre, editor of the
Scottish American of New York, said:
"I shall certainly say a good word
for San Francisco in my paper, and
especially of the splendid .method
she has adopted to put before the
people her claims to greatness and her
wonderful possibilities."
, William . Crittenden, the young man
who won the Rhodes scholarship at
the University of California, is here
on his way to Oxford. He met three
of his fellow students here â Robert
Waring, clerk at the California
building; Frank McConnell, clerk at
the Alaska building, and O. F. Snedi
gar. who came here for the Olympic
games. Crittenden was the guest of
honor at a dinner at which the four
gathered. They will soon be widely
separated, for Waring goes to Chi-,
cago to study law, McConnell to Har
vard to take a law course and Snedi
gar will remain In California.
Clusters of dates are evidently not
a familiar sight to people from most
pÂ»rts of the world, Judging by the in
terest aroused by some fine ones dis
played In Jars by Commissioner Jop
lin of Orange County. There is prob
ably more inquiry as to what they
are. than there is regarding any other
unusual product shown by California!
Commissioner Joplln has to answer
more questions concerning them than
any other product he has on exhibi
tion and there are fewer dates grown
In Orange County than anything else.
The bunches are usually mistaken for
olives, though a great many think
they are grapes and some even Imag
ine they are peanuts.
There are two exhibits of dates, onÂ«
cluster being shown by F. A. Gates
and his daughter, Mrs. N. E. Town*
of Santa Ana, and the other by J. J.
Eyerhardy of Anaheim. Tlie date in
dustry is hot a very important one in
Orange. Each of these gentlemen
has one palm and there are a few
more scattered throughout Southern
California. The industry has never
thrived because it takes fifteen years
for the palm to come into bearing and
besides there is an uncertainty as to
whether the dates will ripen rapidly.
They usually fall oft the side of the
cluster not exposed to the sun in the
parts of Southern California where
tijees now exist. Mr. Gates managed
to get some good ones from his tree
during the Chicago fair. He sent them.
to that exposition and naturally got
a gold medal for the best American
dates. S
CALL, BUREAU, WORLD'S FAIR,

For Saturday, business on the Stock and
Bond Exchange was active, but prices showed
Httl-s chanre. The sugar stocks were- quieter
than for some - little time back, and bonds
seemed to attract the most attention. The oil

weve quiet, though the Tonopahs showed more
activity. "

The market for table Grapes was demor
alized..as receipts were very heavy anil . the
snipping demand did not come up to expecta
tions. The steamer UmatiUa took cut. several
thousand packages for Puget Sound ports, but
most : of ' them were transferred dirÂ»ct from
the Martinez boat to the steamer , and several
shipments that were left behind by the Hono
lulu Â¦ steamer wer? thrown back on* the mar
ket. Local dealers were able to buy at ea^y
figures, and after the first Â¦ rush Â¦ of the early
trade s commission men were â¢Â¦ making rcnvrs
sions' In . order to dispose of the surplus. Ber
ries and ! Melons : were, quiet and weak. Stoqlts
of this latter included much carrled-over. jtock
and prices had a wider ranse; in consequence.
Apples were weak for /all grades and most

offerings. Prices Â¦ of ether > rteclduoua fruits

Receipts of Produce.
COTTON" â The stronger undertone which
fhÂ« roUoo market has displayed the past week
has been mainly due to the absence of any
further eÂ«llinz pressure of importance and a
more conservative feeling developing among
the local traders, the majority of whoa have
been bearish in their ideas regarding the
course of prices. The trading has become
narrow and more professional the last few
days, but it locks as though the market will
rort'.nue a eocd one for scalping operations
fcr moderate profits by fluctuating within a
comparative narrow range until the next regu
lar monthly Government crop report Is an
nounced. We would advise against becoming
too bearish on the market, and would rather
adopt a waiting attitude and adhere to a
â¢cslper"* position for moderate profits pending
further developments calculated to make the
crnp situation and outlook more reassuring.
OOJTTIE â Speculation In the coffee market
continues moderately active, with the general
rituatlon and outlook favorable to ultimately
rlgn^r prices on the shortage of this season's
crop and the unfavorable prospect for next
year 5n consequence of recent unfavorable con
ditions oausinj rather poor flowering.
The New Tork wires of B. F. Hutton &
Co. yesterday said:
ETOCKS â Trading to-day was Influenced
entirely by the bank statement. The .profes
sional element sold stocks on anticipation of
a bad statement and the possibility of further
cold weather in the Northwest, which was re
ported this morning. Argument is made in
Wall etreet that the present rise In. stocks has
â¢".iBcour.ted every favorable condition possible.
Tfcls irUtht be considered true if the advances
were not made from absurdly low figures made
In 1905. We look to see the market have its
healthy reactions, but a higher range of prices
seems inevitable for eood securities later on.
The market has broken all previous records
this week for continued activity on a rising
ecaJe cf Trices since the boom times of sev
eral years aro. The future stability of the
market more than Â«ver J depends on the real
1 ration of a bir crop of 'corn, in view of the
liwenlng prcsjects for a record breaker con
dition of cotton, and the very worst views and
lowest crcr> estimates en wheat having been
Â«~nnflnre<l by iaFt week's GovernrVent report.
Vast amounts of stocks havo been accumu
!at*<J Curing the past ten days, however.
Butter and Eggs closed the week very firm,
with the finer grades well cleaned up. East
ern Butter shows an advance, and is moving
off very well. . Ranch Eggs are also higher.

is still In good supply, though the market

Trade in Potatoes and Onions was of a light
Jobbing character, ,belng confined 'wholly to
the filling of small orders Â¦ for ordinary routine
requirements. The market was weak, with
supplies still in, excess of the demand. Fresh
arrivals of Sweet Potatoes did a little' better,
.but old lots dragged at. unsteady prices.
Tomatoes continued to arrive ' freely and
were a glut on the market, no reasonable
offer being refused for low-grade offerings.
The canners were not buying in the opea
market, b.lng abundantly supplied with con
tracted stock. Previous prices ruled for all

Kennedy's case. has become a cele
brated one. He was tried- and con
victed, but was granted a new trial by
Judge Cook. The District Attorney ap
pealed to the Supreme Court and
Judge : Cook- was - sustained on the
ground that Kennedy could not be
convicted on the uncorroborated testi
mony of an accomplice. Judge Cook
discharged Kennedy, but he was
promptly arrested for another crime.
He was released several times on
writs of habeas corpus and rearrested
each time till finally the District At
torney laid the case before the. Grand
Jury and Kennedy was again indicted.
A writ was applied for to the Supreme
Court for his release, but it was de
nied, and he has : now to stand his
trial for the second time.
Attorney Newburg, who represents
Kennedy, called Assistant District At
torney Ferral to the stand with the
object of producing the notes taken at
the Grand Jury investigation. Ferral
said he : did not' know where the
stenographe'r's notes could be found.
Newburg said he wanted to. show that
the defendant was being persecuted.
The Judge (denied the motion and
Kennedy was arraigned on the charge
of murder. Newburg asked for ' an
early trial and the Judge replied that
it was impossible, as there were sev
eral murder cases already set for trial.
After a few, questions by Newburg
the Judge finally set the case for trial
on October 10., Newburg .entered a
plea of, once in jeopardy and at his
request was granted a thirty days'
stay to prepare a bill of exceptions on
the denial of the motion to set aside
the indictment.
The Supreme Court havlnsr denied
the writ of habeas corpus for the re
lease of William B. Kennedy, alias
"Yellow." charged with complicity in
the murder of Policeman Eugene C.
Robinson at Sixteenth and Valencia
streets on Janaury 21, 1902, the case
against Kennedy was called in Judge
Lawlor's court yesterday on the mo
tion to dismiss the indictment.

The trial of T. A. Rigdon, a ticket
broker, charged with disobeying a
writ of injunction, was on before Judge
Murasky yesterday morning. The chief
v.itness of the day was James Smith, a
young man who secured a ticket to
Chicago from Rigdon's office, which the
railroad company refused to validate.

money, to come home. In reply he re
<?eived a letter inclosing an order on
"Rigdon's ticket office for a ticket to
Chicago. v â
He presented the order and was told
to return in half an hour and his ticket
would be ready. On his return he was
Jianded the return half of a Knights
Templar excursion ticket. He was
shown his signature on the ticket, the
clerk explaining "we copied it as near
ly as was possible."
"He then told me." continued the
-witness, "to go down to the validation
office and have St validated. He also
instructed me not to return, saying
'that everything would be all right. At
the Southern Pacific Company's office
I was toM it was no good."
Smith is a pale, slight-built youth
who hÂ«.s just passed his twenty-first
Â¦birthday. The ticket he held described
its owner as a middle-aged man. He
had never signed the ticket himself and
did not know in whose handwriting the
signature was.

Tho cure of a beautiful little eirl
whose picture heads this article is an-
other distinct triumph for the Electro-
Chemic treatment. The little girl is
Rosa Solari. age seven years, the daugh-
ter of B. Solari of No. 4733 Telegraph
ave.. Oakland. Little Rosa suffered se-
verely from a catarrhal affection which
affected her In every way. but the most
serious effect was upon her ears. The
ears discharged foul and bad-smell in?
matter, and the child could not hear. The
Jact that she could not hear made it Im-
possible for her to go to school with any
advantage, and it also affected her gen-
eral health to such an extent that she
was miserable. The left side of the head
was painful; she was weak; she could
not eat. and she had no disposition for,
play. The Electro-Chemic treatment 1
helped her from the very start. In a'
very short time all pain In the head had
left, the discharging from the ears
stopped, her appetite returned, and. best
of all. she hears perfectly, whereas
Bhc was almost deaf before taking
the Electro-Chemic course. At a very
Â«mall erpense and in a very short time
the child has been perfectly cured. Her
parents are so delighted with the change
%n the little girl that they are only too
-glad to make this public acknowledg-
ment of the success of the Electro-
Chemic treatment in the serious case of
their little daughter. Any one Interested
in this case is perfectly at liberty to call
upon the parents in regard to it. And
thus the evidence is piled up. Grateful
patients are still giving public testimo-
nials of the remarkable curative effects
of Electro-Chemistry. These testimonials
are from well-known people and every
one Is genuine. Electro-Chemistry Is the
only treatment known to* science that
cures ringing head and ear noises. It is
the only treatment that cures chronic
Â¦discharging ears. It is the only treat-
snent that cures deafness with cer-
tainty. It seems strange that people
â¢who have heard of the success of the
Electro-Chemic treatment in ear diseases
are still continuing to waste money and
time upon the old-style methods of treat-
tnent. which are bo uncertain and which
Â¦rarely ever cure. The Electro-Chemic
treatment is the most successful treat-
ment known for the cure of Consump-
tion. Catarrh. Asthma. Bronchitis, Rheu-
?na*isrn. Neuralgia. Locomotor Ataxia.
Paralysis. Falling Sickness, Epilepsy,
Dizziness. Headaches. Spots before the
Eyes. Piles. Fissure, Fistula. Stricture.
Prostatitis. VarJcocela. Xerve Exhaus-
tions. Cancers. Tumors. Old Sores. Ab-
Â«cÂ£sses. Weak Heart, Palpitation, Short-
Vi<Â»Â«:8 of Breath, Insomnia. Blood Poison.

treatment is very successful and the pa-
tients are loaned a complete outfit for

PARIS. Seot. 17. â A wave of pop
ular agitation against the "yellow
peril" ha3 resulted here from Japan's
recent remarkable display of force.
This apprehension is shared to a con
siderable extent in official circles,
where is was suggested to-day that
the danger might compel the Euro
pean powers to consider the necessity
of effecting a. coalition for self-de
fense.
The newspapers and political " lead
ers also emphasize the growth of the
periL Henri Rochefort says it be
hooves Europe to take . warninsf â¢ in
time. He asserts that France will be
one of the first to suffer through Jap
an's designs on Indo-China.
Should Chinese troops march into
Manchuria, thus virtually becoming al
lies of Japan, all Europe would soon be
astir. Already German agents are
keeping a close watch upon the yellow
forces gathered west of the Liao, and
Berlin is ' constantly Informed of their
movements. The Emperor, always fear
ful of the "yellow peril," believes his
fears are soon to be proved well found
edâthat the Mikado will throw off the
mask and. the. world will know that
Japan is fighting for more than the
preservation of Manchuria against
Russian aggressionâ that the domina
tion of all Asia is the prize at stake.
Germany sees in the situation a dan
ger that threatens her present holding*,
and has already caused to vanish into
thin air the Kaiser's hopes of colonial
empire in the Far East. Just how far
the Berlin* Government will go in com
batting the "yellow peril" can only be
guessed at now. In diplomatic circles
the belief is general that, if necessary,
she would become an active, as she is
now a moral, ally of Russia.
French possessions in the Orient are
confronted by the same danger that
menaces those of Germany. Already
Pari3 fears that, with China complete
ly dominated and subservient to her
will, Japan will not stop until the last
vestige of European" control has been
swept from the Orient.
In the present situation the eyes of
the world are turned toward America.
It is wondered whether the Washington
Government will remain passive if Chi
na be drawn into the struggle after thÂ«
activity of Secretary Hay at the out
break of the war, -directed toward in
suring the neutrality of the yellow race.

China is the brand that at any mo

ropean powder magazine and cause a
general explosion. Held in leash dur
ing the first few months of the war, the
yellow race appears to be throwing oft
restraint and preparing to become more
than a- passive factor in the struggle.
The constant mobilization of .Chinese
troops along the Manchurian frontier
is becoming ominous; the vague reports
of Japan's intention to- call upon China
to -send -these troops into the. territory
which the brown soldiers have wrested
from' Russia is more ominous. China

Delancey Nicoll. chief counsel of the

to begin the light en the Kennett's ar

several days been stationed along the
docks of New York with the necessary
seizure documents, to be served the
moment the Kennett shall reach port.
It is the opinion of the asphalt trust
officials that this action is just what
the Castro government desired when
the Kennett's expedition was planned,
as it offered an opportunity to shift
the fight from Venezuela to America.
According to secret information sup

Castro and his Cabinet concluded upon
the receipt of the ofiicial protest from
the State Department at Washington
that it v.ouiu be advisable to make
a test case before the United States
courts, instead of Jetting the United
States Government's representatives
launch their fight 5n Venezuela.
So positive is the management of the
asphalt trust that this, the first ship
ment of asuhalt to this country from
Venezuela since the confiscation by thÂ«Â»
Castro government of the property of
the New York and Bermudese Com
pany in Venezuela, is for the purpose
of shifting the battlefield from Vene
zuela to this country, that everything
Is in readiness for the cargo to be
pounced upon on its arrival at New

a cargo of asphalt from Bermudese

cording to â¢word received here, when
the Kennett started on her voyage she
intended to deposit her cargo "at some
point north of Cape Ilatteras." Offi
cials of the asphalt company have been
kept in close touch with the movements
of the shipment all the way up the
coast by secret agents, and they have
not the slightest doubt that she will ar

TOKIO. Sept. 17. â Owing to the
friction between the military authori
ties and the foreign attaches and cor
respondents. Field Marshal Yama
gata, chief of the general staff, to-day
telegraphed to Field Marshal Oyama,
commander in chief of the Japanese
forces in the field, the following:
"The Imperial declaration of war,
as proclaimed to the people, is uni
versally recognized as being based on
the broad principles of Justice. It
makes no distinction of race, religion
or national manners or customs. The
cole object of the war Is to insure the
Kifety of this empire, guarantee the
peace of the Orient, spread the bless
ir.gs of civilization and promote the
general interests of all nations. It is
therefore hoped that these principles
tv ill also find expression in the treat
ment of foreign officers and corre
spondents attached to our armies, and
that, so long as the rule of military
secrecy is not infringed, a frank and
candid consideration will be extended
to them so that the spirit of sincerity
which animates this empire be fully
demonstrated to the whole world."

inge, yesterday, on the subject of Great
Britain's representations in regard to
the contraband of war, admitted the
conditional character of all articles
mentioned in section 10 of article 6 of

and other beasts of burden, which
Russia insists remain in the category
of absolute contraband.
In reply to the representations of

as stated yesterday, railroad material,
certain classes of machinery and boil

be absolute contraband.

TOKIO.' Sept. 17. â Preparations for
th* winter campaign In Northern
Manchuria are being hurried to com
pletion. The Japanese will put be
tween 200,000 and 500.000 troops In
the field and Kuropatkin is expected
to marshal a force not much, if any,
smaller. It is believed that at least
Â£00,000 men all told will take part in
the operations.
The aggressive military party, which
favors tfn invasion of Russian" terri
tory as far as Vladivostok and the
pressing of an attack from the south
as far as Harbin, if not further, has
gained the entire confidence â¢ of the
Mikado's Government. This Is due
mainly to the fact that the Japanese
critics declare the Russians -unable,
man for man. to cope. with the island
Ecl<!iers. while the genius for com
mand on the Russian side is believed
to be limited to a very few generals,
who cannot get their plans quickly
and efficiently executed by the less
gifted offiÂ«rs.
Special Dispatch to Tfce Call.
. The Japanese having .been unable to
follow up their victory at Liaoyang
when the time was ripe, the War Office
sees no reason for a feverish desire on
their part to come into touch with Gen
eral Kuropatkin, now that he has had
time to recuperate his forces. â¢
The question whether a big battle,
will be fought in the vicinity of Muk
den is considered here to be dependent
chiefly upon General Kuropatkin, as It
is not believed that the' Japanese will
be able to force him"" to fight at Muk
den unless he so elects. The . general
idea is that when the advance really
comes the Japanese will simply out
flank Mukden and go direct against Tie
Pass.
The movement of the Japanese land
forces and the appearance of a large
flotilla In the Liao River are believed to
support this view. â¢
While military circles here realize the
strategic weakness of Mukden, there are
plenty of sentimental reasons why Gen
eral Kuropatkin may desire to hold as
long as possible the ancient home, of
the Manchu dynasty. They believe, in
epite of official intimations and press
reports from Mukden to the contrary,
that there will not be a repetition of the
battle of Liaoyang at Mukden. '
As far as the public is concerned in
terest seems again to be gravitating to
ward Port Arthur, where the gallant
fight of Lieutenant General Stoessel's
garrison is being closely watched. The
report that the garrison has been forced
to fall back to the use of home-made
powder, which Is proving defective, is
considered a discouraging factor. It
would be a national grief should the
defense of the fortress fail through lack
of ammunition.
More importance, however, is at
tached in military circles' to the reports
that the Japanese have abandoned the
idea of a direct assault' and are tunnel-
Ing the fortifications, and it is believed
possible that the end may come as at
Sevastopol, with a repetition of the
dreadful carnage at the Malakoff tower.
â¢ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 17.â The
War Office Is displaying,, no especial
concern as yet over the continual skir
mishing on the flafilfg" of "the* Russian"
army, regarding it as the natural desire
of the Japanese to keep' in touch with
the Russian forces rather than a', pre
monitory symptom of a forward move
ment by Commander In Chief Oyama's
army. The authorities are not inclined
to believe that Oyama's advance can
occur within a fortnight unless large
reinforcements have been received and
the work of getting up supplies has
been done more quickly than was sup-,
posed to be possible.

"Panama," continued Senor Pinal,
"began its political career under the
most favorable circumstances. It was
fortunate in selecting a man for Presi
dent who has the confidence of the en
tire population of the isthmus, as was
evidenced by the unanimous vote ac
corded him, and again fortunate in
adopting laws of the same liberal char
acter those of Mexico. These will
insure protection to foreign investors,
who are expected to develop the coun
try. Ours is a very rich country, both
in mineral and agricultural products,
and it only remains for men of wealth
to develop the vast territory through
which the canal will soon extend.
"The republic abounds with rich
placer mines, which the Indians for
years have been working in their crude
way-, bringing their prold to market in
small quantities. In their savage state
they have opposed the invasion of out
siders, but when mining companies are
prepared to enter the domain of the
Indians they will no doubt find a way
of overcoming: opposition. At present
the Government Is directing much en
ergy toward the construction of road
ways and river lords, with the object of
encouraging the development of the in
terior, where few white -men have yet

If any Democrat In the State has ex
ceeded all others in the bitterness with
which he has pursued David B. Hill, it
is William B. Hornblower. If any
Democrat has hit Hornblower harder
than any other It is David B. Hill
The significance of Hornblower's se
lection as temporary chairman of the
convention is apparent. It is evidence
of the aim of the party leaders who
have the co-operation of Hill to bring
together at Saratoga all the elements
that have been acting at variance for
the last twelve or fourteen years and
brlns about a love feast. It has become
clearer than ever to-day that .Hill is
going to control the State convention
from .start to finish. He has had his
talks with Judge Parker, William F.
Sheehan. Patrick H. McCarren, Colonel
Daniel S. Lamont and other leaders and
he knows exactly what their wishes are.
He is going to respect them to a cer
tain extent, and Jud.e Parker has con
"sented to be content with what Hill
does. But Hill Is going to be "boss" of
this, his last convention, and he is not
goinj to be driven fron his purpose by
Democratic newspapers who have been
attacking him so severely recently. In
deed he showed considerable restiveness
to-day under these attacks, and made
It clear that even Hill micht be goaded
too far.

David B. Hill to-day produced his

Democratic convention, which meets on
Tuesday in Saratoga, when he an
nounced that William B. Hornblawer
of New York would be temporary
chairman of the convention.
"Of course," said Hill, when he made
the announcement, "since some of our
Democratic â¢ contemporaries are so
thoroughly convinced that it is to be a
Hil! convention with only HIM men on

that PUCh a good Hill man as Horn

Heinze's anti-trust Republican and
anti-trust Democratic parties, or
ganized by the copper king to fight
the political factions backed bv the
Amalgamated Copper Company, are
on the verge of disruption, according
to an announcement by the executive
committee early this morning, calling
oft the two State conventions set for
September 20. The announcement
caused a furor in political circles in
this State and the abandonment of
the proposed conventions is regarded
as a result of the overwhelming defeat
administered to the Heinze contesting
delegation which, given a half vote in
the State Democratic Convention, lost
in three attempts to effect a fusion
between Democrats and Laborites,
Populists and Anti-Trusts.
Chairman W. B. Georse, who signed
the announcement, declares the senti
ment of the people is such, as the re
sult of the deliberations of the regular
Republicans and Democrats, that
there is reason for the Anti-Trusts to
hold a State convention.
His Anti-Trust Parties Will Not Hold
State Conventions.

% SAN JOSE, Sept. 17.â For the first
time in years there was a free and un
programmed Republican county con
vention In this city to-day. A few
days ago there were rumors of a slate,
but if such a thing existed it was com
pletely smashed by thÂ« turns the nom
inations took. The result is that a
ticket has been named that will re
ceive the support of the entire Re
publican party of the county. The
plunging of ex-Assemblyman Eli
Wright into the Senatorial fight at
noon to-day, after claiming for several
days that he had a cinch on the nomi
nation for Superior Judge, Is believed
to have brought about that state of
affairs which means harmony of the
various Republican ructions. E. A.
Hayes, the Republican candidate for
Congressman In the Fifth District, was
on the floor receiving the congratula
tions of his friends. John D. Mackenzie
and State Senator Louis Oneal were
nlso busy looking after the Interests
of their section of thÂ« party.
The convention was called to order
about 11 o'clock by E. A. Hayes, chair
man of the Republican County Central
Committee, and J. E. Richards, secre
tary. Mr. Hayes was received with ap
plause. He made a short address ex

Cigarmakers Will Carry Case Before
Grand Jury if Sclunitz Fails
to Act.
The Mayor has as yet taken no
action on the charges presented by
CIgarmakers' Union No. 228 against
Police Commissioner John* A. Drink
house, who, they claim, is using his
official position to further the sale of
non-union cigars to saloon-keepera.
In case the Mayor falls to remove
Drinkhouse the union is preparing to
lay the matter before the Grand Jury
and claims to have sufficient evidence
to prove charges of malfeasance
against the Commissioner. . .
The substance of the resolution pre
sented to the Mayor is that Drink
house has used his office to the detri
ment of local manufacturers and de
priving the members of the union of
means of livelihood and protesting
against the retention of Commissioner
Drinkhouse in office.
Hnyward Addition Ix>ts at San Mateo
to Be Sold To- Morrow.
That beautiful grove of oaks adjoining
the palatial Hayward Mansion and
grounds at San Mateo, and which has
been the admiration and has attracted
the eye of every observer, will shortly
be further adorned by the erection of
many picturesque homes. The tract of
land, containing about 19 acres, was pur
chased from the original owners after
the death of the late millionaire, Alvinza
Hayward.
Streets have been opened through the
tract connecting with the main thorough
fares of San Mateo City. The streets
have been graded and macadamized, sew
ers and water mains laid and sidewalks
constructed around each block.
Perfect climate, natural drainage, only
five minutes' walk from the station,
twenty trains a day from Snn Francisco,
fast electric cars leaving every thirty
minutes, and the Bay Shore cut-off short
ening the time to thirty minutes, make
this property the ideal suburban home
place for persons engaged In business in
San Francisco. The property will be sold
at private sale, commencing at ten
o'clock next Monday morninK. September
19. at the office of Baldwin & Howell. 25
Post street. First come, first served.

contain $10 4 4 gold and 38 cents silver
per ton. A drill will be used to pros
pect the land thoroughly.
MAYOR TAKES XO ACTION

armed. He had come to woo Sutsuma-
San with verses on her beauty.
"Honorably deign to chase yourself,"
ordered Machincha.
"Honorably consent to mind your
own business," returned Kado.
"Most Instantly will I blow your
block off," said Machincha.
"I do a not desire to have my block
blown off," remarked Kado.
Whereupon the rivals started an ex
hibition cf jui-Jltsu- When the excite
ment was at its- height Policeman
.Brown and a posse intervened and the
belligerents were removed to the Hall
of Justice. On Machincha was found
an arsenal powerful enough to de
populate a village. He was charged
with carrying concealed weapons. On
Kado was found a volume of Japanese
poems. After some dispute the verses
were not classed as weapons and Kado
was simply charged with disturbing
the peace. The case is continued until
to-morrow.

"My wife is a prize dancer," was the
defense made by Albert Heissner, who
was before Judge Mogan yesterday,
charged with failure to provide for a
minor child.
"What has that to do with the case?"
inquired his Honor. Â¦'.'
."Well, when I get home from work
I find no supper, but two kids to mind.
My wife is' gallivanting around in some
dancing academy. I have no home
really. My wife is dapcingâ dancing
day and night."
"Of course it's not pleasant to have
a wife who is continually tripping the
light fantastic day and night," said
his Honor, "but, as I remarked before,
that has nothing to do with the case.
You have two minor children to keep
moderately filled with condensed milk
or corn beef or something. You have
not done so. I find you guilty."
"Politeness was the cause of my
downfall," eaid Thomas Overman to
Judge Mogan yesterday when convict
ed of peddling without a license and of
battery.
Tom is a vendor of potatoes. He ped
dles them without J.he legal permission.
"It's all right to license dogs and booze
parlors, but to pay license for an Inno
cent potato, that never did anybody
harm except when you get one that Is
too hotâ nix for Tommie." This was his
creed. â¢â¢ V.-
Friday afternoon Tom was driving
along Stanyan street caroling his lay
of "Potatoes, lady!" Policeman Lane
approached and demanded sight of
Tom's license. Nothing doing.
"You are under arrest," said Lane.
"Certainly, sir," said Tom, with a
pleasant smile. "Step right in and we
will drive to the station."
As the chariot passed Haight street
Tom saw Policeman Ceinar standing
n-ar the corner. The courteous potato
peddler reined In his steed and said:
"How do you do, officer? Have you
been well since I saw you last?"
Ceinar looked at him Intently. "You
have the advantage of me, sir," said
the policeman. "Let me see; did I meet
you at Newport or was it at Spider
Kelly's latest function? Your classical
features are somewhat different from
the other potatoes In the wagon. I am (
sure we have met."
"Have you forgotten eur little drive?"
asked Tom. V*" -\.
In an Instant Ceinar's puzzled look
faded. "You are the triple dash ped
dler I arrested on January 5 for selling
without a license. You drove the horse
through a bay window and upset a
family reunion. While I Â»was sepa
rating myself from a pile of broken
glass you made a get-away. Oh, yes,
Thomas. I am charmed to see you
again. A battery charge for yours."
When the Judge found him guilty the
polite peddler murmured, "Thank you.
Delighted to be convicted so charm
ingly."
Primo Toroni's fine ear for music
brought him before Judge Slogan.
Signor Toroni keeps a tavern on Pacific
street, where human songbirds of the
Barbary Coast dip their beaks into the
vino Unto and then warble with in
spired melody.
'Twas night in Primo's tavern. The
piano tinkled softly. Signor Schicciginl,
the prize tenor and popular garbage
wagon driver of the Quartier Latin,
burst into an aria from "II Trovatore."
Enter J. D. Barm. He disapproved.
"You've got to make it ragtime or it
ain't no tune." howled Mr. Barm.
Signor Toroni tip-toed behind the in
truder with a bottle of the deadly vino
tlnto. Smash went the bottle, and the
juice of the grape and other condiments
that are in Barbary Coast paint spurt
ed over Barm. V-* '-Â¦'Â¦
"I christen thee Buttinsky," said Tor
toni jestingly as the, battered intruder
was launched out into Pacific street by
willing feet.
" 'Twas da musk-a of da grand maes
tro, Verdi." explained Toroni to Judge
Mogan. "He spoila da aria."
The case was continued till Septem
ber '1Z.
Lizzie Sharkev tried last Thursday
to emulate her namesake of fistic
fame. Juds:e Mogan was told by three
policemen how the Amazon floored five
peaceful bystanders at Sixth and Mar
ket strePts and challenged all comers
at catch weights.
"She didn't draw the color line,
either." remarked Policeman No. L
"She swun? on the lamp post and
ber.t it," said No. 2.
"And she kicked over a garbage can,"
complained No. 3.
"Foul," said the Judge. "That set
tles It. Thirty days, Lizzie. You can
train in the County Jail."
A. Machincha and A. Kado, rivals
for the smiles of Satsuma-San, glared
at each other in Judge Mogan's court.
Satsuma-San dwells near Pine and
Dupont streets. She is a cherrv blos
som, a lotus flower and a blooming
â¢wistaria. So both the rivals say.
Machincha^ cruises near her dwelling
v.-ith the armament of a battleship
concealed on his person.

S22Siii FOR WOnEN
WHO CAX1COT BE CURED.
The proprietors and makers of Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription now feel
folly warranted, in offering to pay $500
in legal money of ths United States, for
any case of Lencorrhea, Female Weak-
ness, Prolapsus, or Falling of Womb
which they cannot cere. All they ask is
a fair and reasonable trial of their means
of cure.
"If women would study tbe laws of health
â¢sd esc a little more common sense there would
sot be rach a lar[re number to-day suffering
with tbe ills pecslsar to our sex." write* Mrs,
Sal!i- Martins (President Mutual Social Science
Club), of 1S0 South Halstead*Street / Chicago, IU.
" Then when medicine is needed if they would
take tbe 'Favorite Prescription,' they would
have a chance to tret well. I used Dr. Pierce'*
Pavorit* Prescription three years ago and it
cured me of female weakness of several years' .
standing, to I know what I am talking about
when I praise it and always know wast tbe
result will be where it is used." Â¦ â¢ ',
Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets should
be used with . w Favorite i Prescription â¢
whenever a laxative is required.

mobile was moving at a rapid rate
when on turning a sharuj curve Kal

ticed a farmer's wagon coming toward
them. There appeared to be room to
avoid hitting the wagon, and Kalleen
turned out, but the outside wheels
slipped and the machine slid down the
embankment, turning over several
times. Kalleen was caught beneath the
automobile and crushed.
The injured were taken to Ballwin.
where they were attended by a physi

Miss Lou Marquitz will' recover.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 17.âRemark
able results have already been obtained
in the naval target practice now going
on in Menemsha Bight. The vessels of
the North Atlantic squadron in last
spring's target practice broke all the
world's records for rapidity and ac
curacy of fire, both with big and little
guns, but this was daylight work un
der favorable conditions for good
shooting. The big ships are now do-
Ing some extraordinary night shooting.
The experience of the Russo-Japa
nese war has convinced the general
board that in the future the great
naval battles may be fought at night,
and it is certain that most of the tor
pedo work will be done in the hours of
darkness. Hence it is believed to be es
sential to develop the gun pointers in
night work, and already surprising re
sults have been obtained in the prac
tice in the bight. Using her eight-inch
guns one of the battleships made eight
hits 6ut of nine shots at night. The
target, distant about a mile, was illu
minated by a searchlight, and the gun
ners used a special night sight. The
ship from which the shooting was done
was forging ahead In the open sea at
ten knots. ,

AUSTIN, Tex., Sept. 17. â Texas is
the first State in the Union to estab
lish an institute for the treatment of
rabies by he Pasteur method. There
are five other institutions of this char
acter, but they are all private enter
prises. They are situated at New York,
St. Louis, Chicago, Baltimore and At
lanta. It is stated that a large per
centage of the patients for these priÂ«
vate hospitals come from Texas, and
this fact, together with the apparent in
crease year by year of the number of
persons afflicted with hydrophobia in
this State, led the Lesislature at its
last session to make an appropria
tion for the erection and equipment
of a hydrophobia hospital building.
The institution is an adjunct of the
State Insane Asylum at Austin. It
will be completed and ready for open
ing about October 1. -^
Dr. B. M. Worsham, superintendent
of the new institution, has received
twenty applications for treatment
from persons who had been bitten
by rabid dogs within the past three or
four weeks. He was unable to take
charge of any of these cases and most
of the patients went to the Pasteur
institutes of the North and East for
treatment. One of these applicants,
who did not have the money with
which to meet the expenses of the
long trip and for the treatment, died
of hydrophobia. Free treatment will
be given at the Texas State institu
tion to those who are unable to pay
for same and in no case will the
charges exceed $5 per week, which
will go to pay the board of the patient
while at the hospital. This charge
is insignificant compared with that of
the private Institutes, where^the cost
to each oatient for treatment is from
5150 to 5250.

A. very large outstanding short inter
est in these stocks was suspected as an
element in'their advance. The large de
mand for the trunk line railroad stocks
was associated with the strength of the
Steel stocks, but their movement was
accompanied by many rumors, whose
failure of confirmation threw the move
ment open to suspicion of manipula
tion. Thus it , was ' reported Â¦ that Â¦ Penh-
Disappointment was expressed by the
railroad officials over the offerings of
merchandise for shipment westward,
which was not developing as rapidly
as had been expected the week before.
The grain movement, however, was
expanding at a satisfactory rate and
the movement of cotton warranted con
fidence in the values of the cotton car
riers. This group, in fact, played a
conspicuous part in the later move
ments toward recovery in the market,
but their movements were so stimu
lated by manipulation as to lose in
sympathetic effect on the rest of the
market. Great reliance is placed on the
cotton crop to conserve the level of our
export trade for the coming year and
the growth of apprehension over the
corn crop has the effect of enhancing
the importance attached to the cotton
crop.
The foreign trade return for August
showed the value of wheat exports
shrunk to insignificant proportions,
with no prospect of improvement in. the
existing condition of that crop. Even
the corn exports were barely maintained
at last year's unsatisfactory level, thus
disappointing the hopes of a growth in
the foreign demand for our corn as a
consequence of the shortage of wheat.
The foreign trade statement displayed
a gratifying expansion In the value of
exported manufactures, and this -was
cited as a factor in the great strength
developed in the United States Â¦ Steel
stocks. The explanations for, this move
ment were somewhat meager and were
not found â¢' in reports of conditions in
the trade or in the views of trade au
thorities on the outlook.
MANIPULATION" "SUSPECTED.
The complexion of the stock market
has been decidedly mixed during the
last week. On dealings which rose
more than a million shares a day large
selling to realize has come on the mar
ket, which has been opposed by sturdy
support, causing effective recoveries ai
times. No points of aggressive strength
have been developed. The market
of the earlier portion of the week suc
cumbed generally to the pressure on it,
and it was in the latter period that re
sistance to the decline developed.
Free realizing was expected in view
of the proportions of the previous ad
vance and the lack of new incidents
to extend it. But the reaction was ag
gravated by a number of unfavorable
developments which caused uneasiness
as to the stability of values. The most
important and effective of these was
the deterioration of the crops. Last
Saturday's Government crop report of
conditions on September 1 showed
such a heavy decline in condition of
wheat since the previous report as to
give large influence to the constantly
appearing estimates of a crop much
lower than the Government figures for
the first of the month indicated. The
development of a cold wave and the
occurrence of light frosts in the crop
regions of the West added to the fears
of speculators and the violent specu
lation ia progress in the grain market
exaggerated the effect of all develop
ments regarding the crops. As is
usual in highly speculative markets,
the forecasts of the frost effects largely
exceeded the actual damage, and this
gave room for reactionary effect, both
in the grain and stock markets. But
the recovery in the grangers proved
moderate, leaving it clear that the out
come of the crops is still a potent fac
tor in the securities market. Reports

ARE DISAPPOINTED.
NEW YORK, Sept. 17.â Prices of
stocks underwent a sharp reaction to
day under the combined Influence of an
unfavorable bank and ap
prehension of crop damage. The holi
day in the London market was also a
factor. The news regarding the crops
was not discouraging, warmer weather
being the rule. The grain markets were
reactionary, but the highly speculative
conditions in those markets made Wall
street somewhat suspicious of them as
a reliable index of real conditions. The
selling of stocks was more dueto fears
of possible developments regaWing the
crops during the Sunday interval not
now foreseen. St. Paul was the leader
of the decline, but the other grangers
and Pacifies were not far behind. The
break in Reading was a large influence,
as early attempts were made to ad
vance the Drice on the score of the fa
vorable annual report. But the evi
dence of important selling on the ad
vance suggested that the best buying
due to the annual showing had been
done already, and was waiting to take
profits. The support of United States
Steel preferred also proved futile. The
further 510,472,600 loan expansion dis
closed by the bank statement disap
pointed any expectation that the week's
liquidation in the stock market was re
ducing that item. Its increase is at
tributed by bankers to interior borrow
ings for crop moving purposes. The in
terior demand is also responsible,- of
course, for the further $8,460,800 shrink
age in the cash item. The net result is
a decline of 59,055,100 in the surplus of
the banks, admonishing circumspection
in the treatment of the money situa
tion. Total sales of bonds, par value,
51,965,000.

THE MINISTRY
Later the case was brought before
the conference again, and after much
discussion over the method of trial the
case was referred to one of the pre
siding elders, Dr. Matthews. Debate
waxed hot for some time. Morrow
wanted to be tried at Jackson, where
he resides and whence came the formal
charges, which were withdrawn before
presentation to the conference. Rev.
Mr. Phelpa, pastor of the church at
Jackson, being the accuser. This, how
ever, was to be decided by Dr. Mat
thews. But the accused minister chose
the shortest way to escape, and after
a vigorous defense of his character
gave notice .through Dr. Wilson that
he would withdraw from the ministry
and the membership of the church.
The conference, by vote, expunged
"Tour committee appointed to inquire
into the complaints against Rev. Mr.
Morrow beg leave to report that, after
hearing both sides, they are unanimous
In the opinion that charges should be
preferred and the case be brought to

so complied.
The case of Rev. Mr. Dearborn was
also reported by a committee of f ve
appointed yesterday to investigate his
ministerial efficiency. The report,
read by Rev. Mr. Burcham of Arcata,
recommended that he be requested to
"locate." This means that he shall
take the rank of a local preacher, not
because of any moral fault in his
character or pulpit ability, which were
not brought Into question, but be
cause of certain qualities in his make

made no defense and will retire to the

CALIFORNIA IS INVITED
TO NORTHERN EXPOSITION
CITY OF MEXICO, Sept. 17.âPresi
dent Diaz's message, delivered at the
convening of Congress, was of the usual
length and dwelt particularly on the
friendly relations existing with all for
eign powers. The arrival of the flrst
diplomatic representative of China was
noted and the President spoke of the
progress of public improvements
throughout the Federal district. He re
ported the result of the sanitary cam
paign against yellow fever as gratify
ing. There had been no recurrence of
the disease in epidemic form during the
year.
The President reviewed at length the
notable advances made here in educa
tion.
During the first half of the current
fiscal year 1600 titles were granted to
mining property. There has been a
notable activity in mining production,
and Mexico now takes second rank as
a producer of copper.
Many concessions for irrigation have
been granted and much has been ac
complished in the line of port works
and drainage systems.
The railway systems of the country
have Increased greatly during the past
year, and the Federal telegraph system
has steadily grown.
The national finances are in excellent
condition. The total revenues of the
fiscal year ending June 30 were over
$85,000,000. This Is a gain of $8,000,000
over the previous fiscal year.
In reference to military affairs, the
President said great progress has been
made in Improving and modernizing
armaments and the artillery has been
strengthened. He states that the new
war vessels constructed in the United
States and Italy will add to the impor
tance and efficiency of the navy.
No mention is made of monetary re
form, which may come before Congress
this year or next spring In a special
session.
The message is replete with facts
demonstrating the great progress made
here and the business community re
gards it as contributory to maintaining
domestic and foreign confidence, as it
shows a remarkably solid condition of
the national finances.

MEXICO MAKES
RAPID ADVANCE
This sentence is found in the Bee's
editorial defense of Bell: "In putting
that institution (the Soldiers' Home at
Yountville) on the same plane as the
National soldiers' homes Congressman
Bell performed a service for which he
is entitled to great credit from all fair
minded men."
Congressman Bell knows, the veter
ans at the home know and the Bee
would know if Bell gave the paper the
cold, plain truth, that the bill was
amended in the Senate after it left the
House, so that Bell's amendment could
not apply to the National homes. The
canteen exists at the National homes
to-day in the same maner and stylÂ£ as
it existed before the Bell amendment
was introduced. Senators who had
given the subject profound study fa
vored the maintenance of the canteen
as a temperance measure. Under the
Bell amendment not even a glass of
beer or 'the lightest kind of wine pro
duced in California or elsewhere can be
sold on the State Home premises. The
canteen is in full blast at the National
homes. It is utterly abolished in the
State homes. While the Bee is telling
its readers that the Yountville institu
tion has been placed on the same plane
as the National soldiers' homes, Con
gressman Bell is telling the veterans
that he will have the canteen restored
at the next session of Congress.
A candidate for Congress who en
deavors to win the Prohibition vote in
one end of his district and the liquor
vote in the other end will surely come
to exposure and grief. It is no easy
task to fool the people in these days of
rapid commuication. The voters of the
Second District are intelligent men. As
a rule they do not care whether the
canteen is abolished or maintained, but
they will note the double dealing of
the Congressman in the premises.
The Sacramento Bee is pleading that
justice be done Congressman Bell. The
Bee declares that Bell is not a prohibi
tionist and that his action in closing
the canteen at the Soldiers' Home was
not inspired by prohibition sentiment.
Perhaps the Bee is very nearly correct
in this statement. Politicians familiar
with conditions in Napa County enter
tain the belief that Bell closed the can
teen in order to give the retail liquor
traffic of the Home to the saloons near
the reservation. There is no doubt,
however, that Bell is fishing for the
prohibition vote. His achievement in
closing the canteen was thus hailed by
the New Voice of Chicago, the national
prohibition organ: "An unexpected vic
tory. One stroke wipes oui canteen in
thirty Soldiers' Homes."
"The Home Alliance." the Prohibi
tion paper of Woodland, is supporting
Bell because he abolished the canteen.
Men who believe that the cause of tem
perance is promoted by the abolition of
canteens surely have a right to their
convictions. There is a wide difference
of opinion in regular army and Grand
Army circles as to the value of the can
teen as a temperance agency. Bell has
an undoubted right to take the Prohi
bition end of the argument. Political
exigencies may excuse him for at
tempting to deceive the voters of Re
publican faith, but nothing can excuse
him for misleading his best friend in
the district, the Sacramento Bee.
mining counties and, truth to say, he
does not even represent the views of
the people of his own county."
SECOND DISTRICT.
"While our Congressman is engaged
in this task Caminetti is in San Fran
csco giving birth to interviews in the
Examiner, in which he says, among
other things: 'There Is a universal de
mand In the mining community for the
completion of the dam on the Yuba.
The policy should be to build these
works as the plans already prepared
contemplate.'
"That shows just how much the
Amadox light knows about the mining
question. The Government is not build
ing a dam on the Yuba, but it is con
structing a barrier â a very different
thing from a dam â on plans that have
repeatedly been demonstrated to- be
worthless, the demonstration having
been made by the Yuba River itself,
which has washed them away and will
wash away the barriers now under con-
Btruction as sure as the winter tor
rents begin to flow. There is no uni
versal or any other demand for barriers
on the Yuba, because the mining com
munity is composed of men of sense
who have learned engineering in the
school of practical experience and know
that the barriers are utterly useless
just a waste of money.
"Of course there is nothing to pre
vent Tony Caminetti from running for
Congress, now that his party has in
sisted on his running In order that the
party ticket shall not have a blank on
the official ballot presented for the con
sideration of the voters opposite the
office of Representative from this dis
trict, but when he presumes to speak
in the name of the miners, he Is going
too far. He represents neither the
miners nor the other industries of the
"Tony Caminetti, the Amador law
yer who. after being a Congressman
and being defeated for re-election, went
to the Assembly rather than go no
where at all, poses as being thoroughly
acquainted with the mining business.
Congressman Glllett, who represents
the district and accomplishes things,
is even now seeking to find some way
to permit men of small means to de
velop th^-ir properties without going to
the needless expense entailed by the
bill that the Amador statesman finally
got through Congress with a lot of ex
pensive amendments tacked on through
Caminetti's vanity, incompetency and
ignorance.
The candidacy of Caminetti in the
Firnt does not alarm the Republican
press of Northern California. The Tid
ings of Nevada County contributes
this chapter to the campaign litera
ture:
The Republican State Central Com
mittee is quite confident of Gillett's re
election by an increased majority In
the First, and of a complete victory for
McKinlay in the Second. The latter
perhaps has the harder battle, but he Is
making a splendid impression wherever
he goes. He is able and courageous.
His public record is without a stain
and his private character is above re
proach. The Second District is nor
mally Republican by 2500 majority, and
politicians predict that McKinlay's plu
rality will exceed that figure.
FIRST DISTRICT.
The Democratic State Central Com
mittee of California claims that Cami

the Second, will be elected to Con

intend to concentrate all their forces
to hold the Second' District and cap

COXGRESS1OXAL. FIGHTS
A leading Democratic politician, who
is familiar with affairs at the City
Hall, predicts that the Mayor's sojourn
away from San Francisco will be brief,
as the Democrats in the Board of Su

reigns of municipal government as soon
as the Mayor was out of sight.
On a former occasion when the elo

East the compliment of a visit he spoke
in behalf of the Democratic cause. As
he now contemplates a speech in sup
port of Republican principles ample
proof of his all around accomplish
ments as an orator may be presented.
Mayor Eugene K. Schmitz of San
Francisco may decide to go East in a
lew days and speak for Roosevelt and
Fairbanks In New York City and West
Virginia. General George Stone, chair
man of the Republican State Commit
tee, arrived home from Chicago last
night, lie was asked if there was any
truth in the rumur that Chairman Cor
teiyou had invited the Mayer to take
the stump for the Republican cause.
General Stone said the topic was dis
cussed at the Chicago headquarters of
the National Committee a few days
Ogc and that a message from Chairman
Cortelyou had been wired to the
Mayor.
Mayor Schmitz was asked late last
night if he intended to go East and
speak. In -response to the inquiry he
remarked that he had received a tele
gram from Mr. Cortelyou requesting
him to speak in New York and West
Virginia, but had not given a definite
reply, as the message by telegraph
Eaid that a letter mailed on the day
thÂ«^ dispatch was wired would explain
in detail what the committee desired
the Mayor to do in the event uf ac
ceptance. The Mayor wired to Chi
cago that he would give a definite an
swer to the committee's request on re
ceipt of the letter.

Suaju^^t REDINGTON & CO., Wholesale Agents.Entangled by a contract by which C.
S. MacMullan hopes to secure from the
county treasury $21,790, lawyers for the
Board of Supervisors to-day were en
gaged in trying to prove to Judge Ells
worth that the contract was a mean
ingless thing and was of no value. M.
B. Kellogg of San Francisco and M. C.
Chapman of this city have "the other
end of the argument and seem to think
the contract is binding.
The Board of Supervisors gave Mac-
Mullan a contract to expert the assess
ment rolls to discover property he
claimed was escaping taxation. He
was to get 50 per cent of the taxes col
lected on property he found, and In a
few weeks had placed on the assess
ment rolls the water in the reservoirs
of the Contra Costa Company,
valued at $1,000,000; the franchises of
the Oakland Gas, Light and Heat Com
pany for Oakland, Alameda and Berke
ley; the signal block system of the
Southern Pacific Company, also its
franchises for running ferries across
the bay, altogether aggregating nearly
$2,000,000. The taxes on these proper
ties amount to over $40,000, and he is
now suing for half this sum. The con
tract was repudiated by the Board of
Supervisors. Â«
â¢ The arguments to-day were upon a
demurrer to the complaint, but were
far reaching and went to the vital
points of the case. Attorneys Allen,
Snook and Church are defending the
county. The matter was submitted and
taken under consideration by Judge
Ellsworth.

They say that muscles are brought
Into play during a yawn that would
otherwise never get any exercise at
all. The muscles that move the lower
jaw and the breathing muscles of the
chest are the first that come Into use
in the yawn. Then the tongue is
raised, the palate tightly stretched and
the uvula raised.
Near the termination of the yawn
the eves close, the ears are slightly
raised and the nostrils dilate. The
crack sometimes heard in the ear
shows that the aural membranes are
also stretched and exercised, some
thin? that cannot be done by any
other process.
Nasal catarrh, inflammation of the
palate, sore throat and earache may
all be helped toward a cure by the
sufferer's 'making a practice of yawn
ing six or seven times a day. But
good form requires that it should be
done In private, of course.
To be told that physicians recom
mend yawning as a remedy for disease
would make some people smile with
Incredulity, but it is a fact, never
theless.
Frequent Yawn Does Good.
Consul General Guenther at Frank
fort, Germany, reports that the Rus
sian volunteer fleet carried in 130* over
3000 freight consignments from Poland
to Eastern Asia, an increase of 200 pÂ«p
cent over the preceding year. The Rus
sian railroads and transportation com
panies, in order to strengthen this ex
port trade against foreign competitors
In the Chinese market, had not onlr
reduced the regular freight rates on
these consignments, but had even ad
vanced as much as 80 per cent cash
on their value to the shipper, also in
many cases assuming the agency for
the sale of the goods at stations in
China. By that means the manufactu
rers of Poland and Russia were in a
fair way to compete successfully with
Americans and Japanese, who mainly
supplied those markets. But the war
with Japan has unsettled trade In
Manchuria, and the ground gained by
Polish and Russian export trade has
been lost.â New York Commercial.

1 came across a farmer near Toma

for saving ice and one that might be
used with advantage by city people to
escape the clutches of the Ice trust.
said A. F. Lane, who has just returned
from an outing in the woods of North
ern Wisconsin.
"This fellow needed Ice, beta* la the
dairy business, so he dug a hole under
the front porch of his house, makinr it
about seven feet deep, five feet Ion*
and five feet wide. Then when the real
cold weather came he -poured abou* two
feet of water in the hole and let It
freeze, first covering the bottom with
sawdust. Then as the winter progressed
he continued the process, and before
the first thaw warned him of the com
ing of warm weather he covered the Ice
surface with sawdust and made a trap
door through the floor of the porch.
Now when he needs the Ice he has it
handy."â Milwaukee Sentinel.

OAKLAND, Sept. 17.â The last week
has certainly been a, record-breaking
seven days. Never before have so many
important engagements been announced
as during the week just ending, and
even as I write another fair Oakland
girl is receiving congratulations. This
is Miss Mary V. Hyde, whose engage
ment to , a gallant young cavalry of

by her mother this afternoon. Miss
Hyde is the daughter of Marcus D.

who is himself a retired naval officer
and an Annapolis graduate. She is a
popular member of the younger set, be
ing just turned 19. Miss Hyde, besides
being a graduate of Miss Head's school,
has received an excellent musical train
ing and is a pianist of considerable

The Hungarian official pomologlcal
organ states in its latest number that
the enormous supply and peculiar soft
condition of American prunes in Eu
rope has awakened a lively interest
everywhere of late. This organ states
that an examination of such prunes
was made in Germany and that they
were declared to be soaked with a
fluid containing from 10 to 12 per
eÂ£nt of glycerin to artificially increase
their size and weight. The organ
auoted goes on to warn Hungarian
buyers against all American preserved
fruits and to call American fruit mer
chants "profit seeking and officious."
ft is evident from the foregoing that
chere Is a market even in Hungary for
American prunes and that each ship
ment should be accompanied by a cer
tificate of purity from some chamber
of commerce or board of health and
so -well packed as to prevent repack
ing by middlemen In Europe âNew

Dr. Reinhardt gave voice to his views
to-day before a class of 200 men, to
whom he lectured on health at the uni
versity. He said in part:
"As a class, we Americans are not
well bred. We give more attention to
the production of a fine breed of horses
and cows than we do to the production
of strong, healthy men. Our presence
on this earth is a matter of sentiment
largely, and it is no wonder, then, that
some of us are unfortunate in appear
ance; that we have eyes, ears and
noses and heads out of shape and dis
proportloned. If we could only select
the fittest among us for the producers
of our future citizens, what a fine race
of citizens we could have.
"These are serious matters. You men
may be sending sons and daughters of
your own to college some day. Then
bear in mind that sentiment is not the
only thing to think about when you get
ready to enter into wedlock. Do not let
love, playing on. your heart strings, get
the better of your common sense. Some
men marry women they know are not
'fit to make good wives because they
have entered into a courtship blindly
and do not realize until too late that
they have made a mistake. It is all
right to think that there is only one
girl in this world for you, but you
should be very careful In selecting this
one person. When a man selects a
sickly girl or one in whose family there
is some hereditary disorder he is either
a fool or has no regard for his poster
ity."
Continuing, Dr. Relnhardt said that
a man's appearance always plays a
great part in shaping his destiny. To
appear at his best is always important
if a man would succeed, for the tide in
his affairs often turns upon the ap
pearance that he makes. A cheerful and
well-groomed appearance is essential
to the ambitious.

Professor John C. Merriam, professor
of palaeontology at the University of
California, returned to-day from a five
months' trio abroad, the object of
which was to see and compare the fos
sil remains of prehistoric animals in
European museums with those lately
discovered in the limestone beds in Cal
ifornia and Idaho. While abroad Pro
fessor Merriam, who was accompanied
by Mrs. Merriam. visited the museums
in London, Brussels, Liege, Stuttgart,
Berne. Zurich, Milan, Lyons, Les
Eyzies, Paris and at Berne, Switzer
land. He read a paper on "The New
Group of Marine Triassic Reptilia of
California" before the International
Zoological Congress.
At the beginning of last year Pro
fessor Merriam attempted to make an
outline of a monograph, on the triassic
ichthyosauria taken from the beds in
Idaho, but discovered before long that
a considerable part of the collection
was not ichthyosaurian. This discov
ery prompted Professor Merriam to de
cide that before putting his observa
tions into print he would make a study
of types in European museums most
nearly related to the thalattosaurian,
one of the groups to which he had de
voted most of his time and study. The
remains of these reptilia are among the
most striking discoveries known to geo
logical research, and it was because of
their value as new specimens that Pro
fessor Merriam proceeded cautiously
before giving out results.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Sept. 17.
Left alor.c without au attorney,
Charles Pederson, a young real estate
dealpr of this ciiy. found himself this
morning in court facing a hostile
v ife. who was telling the Judge stories
ot his infidelity lo her. He took up
the defense In liis own behalf after
making an Ineffectual attempt to
reconcile his irate spouse, who would
have none of him.
Pederson sosr.e time ago denied that
Sie was married, there being a tech
!;ica! flaw in the proceedings owing to
thi- fact that while the marriage li
cense was procured in this county, the
jrair wore married by Rev. J. Fuendel
ing In San Francisco.
Further trouble was aggravated by
the finding by Mrs. Pederson of photo
graphs of one Mary Johnson, taken In
her room dressed In her husband's
clothes. She identified the room this
nicming by the pictures on the walls.
The clothes she claimed she knew
veil. Further search among her hus
band's effects brought to. light a mar
riage contract signed by Pederson and
Mary Johnson. It set forth that he
had left his wife, to whom, it stated,
he had never been married.
With these wrongs rankling in her
htart, Mrs. Pederson came into court
this morning to prosecute a suit for
divorce begun some months ago. Upon
the calling of the case Attorney Frank
Hcrold told the court that, as he had
received no money, he would with
draw from Pederson's case. Pederson
then made a statement that he would
like a few words with the court in
i hambers. In the presence of Judge
Ogden and Attorney Philip Walsh he
then proposed to go back and live
with his wife. Mrs. Pederson was told
of the offer, but promptly refused to
consider it.
In commenting upon the matter
Judge Ogden said that ordinarily he
would have assisted as far in his
power such a reconciliation, but that
hi the present case he could not take
a part in it for the reason that Peder
son had denied that they were ever
married, and he might do the same
thing again after Mrs. Pederson gave
her consent.
The trial of the case then proceeded
and Mrs. Pederson gave dates and cir
cumstances of visits and evenings
spent by Pederson with Mary Johnson.
She also told the story of the photo
graphs and of the finding of the mar
riage contract.
Pederson took notes and later at
tempted to cross-examine the witness.
The trial will be resumed to-mor
row.

HATWARDS, Sept. 17.â One of the
most successful sessions ever held by
the Grand Lodge of the Portug-ues*
society of the I. D. E. S., which has
been in deliberation here for the last
week, adjourned to-day. Only two con
tests came up before the organization.
One was to remove the office of thÂ»
supreme secretary from Haywards to
Oakland and the other was the election
of the secretary.
The proposition to remove tharofflce
to Oakland was lost by a vote of eighty
to twenty. The election of the secre
tary brought out a spirited rivalry be
tween P. G, Leonardo, who has been
the secretary of the Grand Lodge since
the organization of the society, twelve
years ago, and Frank J. Rose, the re
tiring supreme president of the order,
who was a candidate for election to the
office held by Leonardo. The latter
won out by a scant margin of eight
votes. The social features of the ses
sion were a great success. These con
sisted of a reception by Mayor Heyer
of this city, a barbecue and entertain
ments of various kinds at night.
The following grand officers were
elected: Supreme president, J. V. Dus
of Freeport, Sacramento County; su
preme vice-president, M. C. Sannento,
Boulder Creek; supreme secretary, P.
G. Leonardo, Hay wards; supreme

POINT RICHMOND, Sept. 17.â The
vigorous campaign waged for the past
three months by the ctiizens of Rich
mond for the incorporation of the town
will end next Monday, when the peti
tion for incorporation, prepared and
circulated by. the Greater Richmond
Incorporation Club, is presented to the
Board of Supervisors of Contra Costa
County. The petition bears the names
of nearly every prominent citizen of
Richmond, and the adherents of incor
poration are confident that favorable
action will be taken by the Board of
Supervisors.
Dr. C. R. Blake, president of the
Greater Richmond Improvement Club,
has appointed a committee of fifteen
prominent residents of Richmond to at
tend the meeting of the Board of Su
pervisors, and this committee will be
authorized to take any action neces
sary in the interest of the proposed in
corporation.
The growth of Point Richmond from
a settlement of a few scattered houses
to a town of 4000 inhabitants has been
very rapid, and the citizens believe
that the time has arrived when a mu
nicipal government is not only practi
cable, but is an absolute necessity for
the welfare of the community.
Incorporation will also enable the
residents of Richmond to secure better
sidewalks and etreets, an up-to-date
fire department 'arid will insure ade
quate police protection â something that
has been a necessity for many months.
The petition which will be presented
to the Board of Supervisors at Martinez
next Monday bears the names of 128 of
the best known residents of Richmond.
Among those who have taken an active
part in the campaign. for incorporation
are Dr. Charles R. Blake, the Rev. John
William Jones, H. B. Kinney, W. A.
Lucas, A. J. Solemdahl, W. M. Laidlavv
and Superintendent Dimm of the

1016 Broadway, Sept. 17.
The Rev. Aaron Williams, formerly
a minister of the "Welsh Presbyterian
Church, residing at McCall and Fifty
eighth streets, was killed to-night at
the corner of Grove and Fifty-eighth
streets by a northbound Grove street
car as he was crossing the tracks on
his way home.
The former minister was 84 years of
age and, being very deaf, failed to hear
the bell of the approaching car. He
was struck and thrown forward across
the tracks, directly under the wheels.
The forward trucks of the car passed
completely over the body, breaking
both legs and crushing the chest. The
victim's skull also was fractured. The
car was in charge of Motorman Joseph
Girado. The accident was witnessed
by I. N. Underwood, who lives at the
corner of Grove and Fifty-eighth
streets. Underwood says that the
motorman rang his bell and did all in
his power to avert the accident.
When taken from beneath the car
the aged clergyman was dead. The
body was removed to the Morgue.
Deceased leaves a widow, but no
children.

Valley end Church streets", began last
night under the most favorable aus
pices. The interior of the handsome
new edifice was decorated with flags,

Frank A. Maestretti, Commissioner
of Public Works, accompanied by his
attorney, R. H. Countryman, appeared
before Police Judge Cabaniss yester
day and swore to complaints charg
ing M. H. de Young: of the Chronicle,
R. A. Crothers of the Bulletin and
Thomas Garrett of the Post with
criminal libel. The alleged libel was
contained in the Chronicle and Post
of September 10 and in the Bulletin
of September 15. ! Bail was fixed in
each case at S23 cash. The warrants
â¢were served on De Young and Gar
rett, who each furnished bail. Croth
ers was out of the city.
Charles Wyman, who was arrested
on complaint of Fairfax H. Wheelan
on a charge of ballot box stuffing in the
seventy-third preciivct at the primary
election.was served with a new warrant
j'esterday and immediately released
after being booked at the City Prison
on the bail bond he had already fur
nished. The new complaint had to be
sworn to because of a clerical error
in the one issued last Wednesday.
Lute yesterday afternoon, through
Attorney Countryman, Charles Wy
man filed a suit for $250,000 damages
against Fairfax H. Wheelan. In the
complaint Wyman alleges that Whee-
Itin's charge against him of illegal
voting was made in bad faith and that
Wheelan acted with malice and op
pression. To support this he says
that if Wheelan saw him voting the
name of another citizen, as was al
leged in the criminal proceedings, he
should then and there have called the
attention of the election officers and
the police officers on duty. The
prosecution is alleged to be a part of
a political plot to aid party factions.

Knight's address was almost wholly
devoted to the Philippine question. He
quoted from Judge Parker's speech ac
cepting the Democratic Presidential
nomination on this subject and an
swered the various arguments. He de
nied that the administration* had ever
intimated that the islands were to b-i
kept permanently as American terri
tory, but he made an extended argu
ment in favor of their retention as a
part of American territory. He cited
statistics to show that almost all the
people of the tropics are governed by
the nations of the temperate zone. The
new policy of preferential duties be
tween mother countries and colonies
which is being adopted by the Euro
pean nations would, the speaker de
clared, soon place the United States at
a great disadvantage so far as the pur
chase of tropical products is concerned
if the Philippines were given up. He
denied that the islands are being ex
ploited by the Americans and declared
that, on the contrary, this Government
is expending money ln the development
of the country's resources and the edu
cation of its people.
"So long," said he, "as a great politi
cal party in America continues harp
ing for our premature withdrawal from
those islands, so long will capital, to
any extent, refuse to go there; prosper
ity will slumber and sooner or later
even the Government will languish â a
puny bankrupt. National greatness and
material progress go hand in hand. The
Filipinos themselves are beginning to
see that in order to place their country
in^,the list of modern states their ad
vance in culture, education and science
of government must have for balance a
corresponding degree of material pro
gress. This requires capital and the
knowledge and experience to use it."
George A. Knight of San Francisco,
who seconded the nomination of Pres
ident Roosevelt in the Republican Na
tional Convention, followed Senator
Foraker. Knight aroused much
laughter and applause by his clever
hits at the Democracy.

The fact that Hawley is closely iden
tified with the interests of Henry E.
Huntington and was a close friend of
the late C. P. Huntington arouses the
suspicion that H. E. Huntington, and
possibly the widow of the late president
of the Southern Pacific Company, have
agreed to furnish some of the funds for
the construction of the^new road. It Is
also reasonable to suppose that George
Crocker is interested in the project, in
asmuch as he is a partner of Hawley
in many of the latter's enterprises.
Hawley is the head of the so-called
Hawley railroad properties, which in
clude the Iowa Central Railway, the
Memphis and St. Louis Railroad, the
Colorado Southern and- the Des Molnes
and Fort Dodge Railroad. Only recent
ly his friends ' joined him In acquiring
control of the Chicago and Alton Rail
road. He is also an important factor In
the Colorado Fuel and. Iron Company,
the Commercial Cable Company and
several large banking and trust con
cerns of New York. He was for many
years a -director of the Southern' Pa
cific, Company, but resigned recently
when war between himself and Harri
man was declared.
Interesting speculation is rife over the
ultimate purposes of the Western Pa
cific Railway Company. It was greatly
stimulated yesterday when it became
known that Edwin "Hawley . of New
York and one of E. H. Harriman's fin
ancial foes had become a director of the
new railroad enetrprise, in which the
Goulds are an important factor. At a
meeting of the directors of the Western
Pacific yesterday Director Henry F.
Fortmann resigned and Hawley was
elected to fill the vacancy on the board.
A few days ago two of the representa
tive men of the Goulds, William H.
Taylor of New York and Edward T.
Jeffery, president of the Denver and
Rio Grande Railroad, were chosen di
rectors of the new company, and it was
naturally expected that within a very
short time others of the original direct
ors of the corporation would make way
for Gould men.
Edwin E. Hawley's sudden entrance
into the company's affairs came as a
great surprise to local financiers, who
in the absence of an explanation from
those interested in the Western Pacific
have quickly accepted the election of
Harriman's opponent as an indication
that the Goulds do not feel like carry-
Ing the entire burden of responsibility
attending the carrying out of the new
transcontinental road, and have taken
Hawley and his followers into their
camp.

Bridget Richardson filed suit yes
terdayagainst William C. Herbert and
the Swiss-Italian colony for $25,000
damages for the loss of her son, who
was suffocated in a wine tank on July
8, 1903. Young Richardson was
working with a gang of coopers re
pairing the tank and descended Into it
to recover a tool dropped by one of
the workmen. The fumes of the wine
suffocated him, and Mrs. Richardson
claims the defendants were guilty of
criminal neglect in not informing her

HAW LEY JOINS
WITH GOULDS
The residents of the peaceful neigh
borhood of Green Valley, and principal
ly that portion of it bounded by San
chez, Twenty-seventh, Duncan and
Church streets, were awakened from
their slumbers shortly after midnight
yesterday morning by a terrific ham
mering, bombarding and smashing.
They rushed from their beds Into the
streets, barefooted and bareheaded. At
first many of them- thought the seat of
the Russo-Japanese war had Â¦ been
transferred to their- part of town. Upon
investigation, however,; they found that
the noise was occasloned'-by a gang, of
men who, with axes ..were demolishing
a shanty^that had r been erected for. the.
purpose of closing up an alley running
through the block already, named.
This alley, has for years been used by
the residents as a thoroughfare. The
oldest residents in .the block have been
there twenty -five . years. They bought
their property,". from Joe Comerford,
as they declare,\with the understand
ing that the alley was public property.
They had horses and wagon3 which
they kept in the rear of theft" premises
facing the alley until two years ago,
when L. Seellger bought the alley. Now
their horses and buggies are gone. See
llger says he bought the alley from.the
Cornerford estate, or from " the Ger
mania Bank, which held a mortgage on
the estate. He immediately closed up
the alley by putting fences at both
ends. These were promptly torn down
by the Indignant property holders. See
liger then .sold his eastern half of the
alley to S.'T. Kenyon, who lives. at 318
Duncan street and has a basket manu
factory on .his premises. Kenyon erect
ed two warehouses in. the alley, but left
a space of six feet so that people could
pass by.
About two months ago.. Seeliger
leased to Gustave Alstead his west end
of the allev, and Alstead erected a
cheap, rough shack, completely closing
up the alley. It was an eyesore to the
whole neighborhood. There was no door
to it In front, and it had. the appear
ance of a big dry goods box. Alstead,
so the neighbors say, had no toilet con
veniences connected with his abode,
and to add to the general complication
brought his horse and pastured him in
the alley.
Alstead has been having trouble with
his wife and a suit for;dlvorce is now
pending. During the j marital mix-up
Alstead took possession of a horse and
buggy that he .'claims' was community
property. His wife -threatened to have
Alstead arrested. -While Alstead was in
town trying to get matters adjusted the
neighbors, . or other persons interested,
jumped upon the shanty and complete
ly demolished it.
Alstead, who says that he lives at 55
East Park street, visited the neighbor
hood yesterday, but he did not attempt
to go to the demolished building^ Per
haps he was wise, as the residents
thereabouts were greatly excited and in
no humor to give him a flattering re
ception.
Seellger, who keeps a butcher shop at
Mission and Twenty-ninth streets, pro
fesses to know very little about the af
fair. He says he owns half of the alley
and that he proposes to hold it. Ken
yon, who owns the other half, says
that Alstead put up the house without
obtaining a permit from the Board of
Public Works, and that the neighbors,
learning of this, decided to take de
cisive steps in the matter.
The story, told .the Grand- Jury was
that Da Silva bought . the women in
Canton at prices .ranging from $500
to $700, and that contracts were for
mally entered into for the engage
ment at . St. Louis. ,' The four women
did not learn until they were -upon
the ocean what was In store for them
in the United States and they saved
themselves from the horrible fate by
appealing to the Immigration Com
missioner. In China they had been
employed as household servants.
Lee Toy declared yesterday that the
four women gave false testimony
when they, alleged that his purpose
was to introduce them to a life. of
shame. "We had planned a very at
tractive village," he said, "and want
ed native; Chinese to make a scene of
realistic industrial activity. I did not
see any of the women untllthey were
brought to the steamship the morn
ing of our departure, Da Silva having
picked them up. There is absolutely
nothing in the allegations that our
scheme was criminal In its nature."
BOUGHT WOMEN IN ; CANTON.
It is believed that an indictment
was found against HJ L. A. Eca da
Silva, who was associated with Toy
in the importation of -.the steerage
crowd that, came on the steamer Dor
ic. Da Silva is in St Louis, however,
and until the arrest is made on the
telegraphic order | that; was sent yes
terday no information as to the
charge will be given out.
Da Silva was formerly an Interpre
ter in the office of Immigration Com
missioner Hart North, but being dis
missed some months ago entered the
employ of the concession concern to
help bring over the Chinese. Lee Toy
Is said to be connected with a large
Oriental goods firm . of Philadelphia,
known as the Chong Wah Company..
In the female contingent of the im
portation were four women who, upon
their arrival in â¢ this port, declared
that they had been purchased in Chi
na and were intended â¢ for immoral
purposes at the exposition and as long
as they should remain in this country.
Commislsoner North detained these
women, sending. them to the Occiden
tal Mission Home for safe keeping un
til the matter could â¢ be investigated
and â¢ arrangements . made, for deporta
tion.. But ; a mysterious. feature of the
case /Is that the eight other women,
who were in the same party. and had
been' Induced , by, the same men to
leave their native' land, were allowed
to proceed to St. Louis. 1. In their an
swers before the Immigration bureau,
however, they gave! no" intimation be
yond the 'mere -statement that -they
had come to enter the employ of. the
concession company. ' [-,. \j -}>'Â¦! . ?' ' - '.
The probing by the Federal Grand
Jury into the importation of Chinese
slave women by members, of the com
pany which holds the . Chinese con
cession at the St. Louis Exposition re
sulted in the return of an indictment
yesterday against . Lee Toy, president
of that concern. Toy was taken into
custody by Secret Service Agents^Ha
zen, Foster and Moffett at 727 Sac
ramento street, where he has been
living since his" arrival' a few weeks
ago with 207 Chinese, twelve of them
women, whom he brought over, as he
explains, to place in the village, which
he. aimed to make, one of the chief
attractions of the fair. -
Bail was fixed at $5000, but Toy
was unable to obtain the aid ho ex
pected from the surety company be
cause Its offices were closed for the
Saturday half holiday. . He will there
fore have to remain at the Broadway
jail until to-morrow, at least.
INDICTMENT OF DA SILVA.
The board. took this action and the
Mayor approved the same and a levy
of 15 cents on each. one hundred dol
lars' valuation of assessable property
for such purposes was accomplished.
Thereafter certain taxpayers insti
tuted legal proceedings for the pur
pose of having the tax declared void
and of recovering their money.
In view of the fact that the court
has decided that the imposition of this
tax upon the taxpayers constituted an
unlawful action and as such that
the money should be returned
to the taxpayer whenever pos
sible, the City Attorney suggests that
provision be made for such repayment
without discrimination in all cases In
which it may legally be done. If the
existing law will not permit the re
payment of the full amount of taxes
to all taxpayers, the Legislature should
be requested to supply the omission at
its next session. â¢ 1; >: V -K
The Board of Supervisors therefore
directed the City Attorney, if he
deemed it advisable, to discontinue
the appeal from the decision, and the
City Attorney entered a dismissal of
the appeal after the Supreme Court
decided as to the validity of the mu
nicipal bond issue on the -ground that
it would be an injustice to taxpayers
to be twice taxed for the same object.
Among those who have entered suit
for the recovery of money paid under
the old tax levy are: Bank of Cali
fornia. $30,725; San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company, $5504; Spring
Valley Water Company, $25,551; Unit
ed Railroads, $35,477; L. F. Young,
$7983; The Hibernia Savings and Loan
Society, $32,865, and H. K. Wolff,
$8449.
The levy of 7% cents on each one
hundred dollars' valuation for school
houses and for a new hospital was in
the nature of an extraordinary levy,
designed to meet a "great necessity or
emergency," and the ordinances under
which they were provided were passed
and approved in attempted compli
ance, with- the provisions of the char
ter. The Supervisors are. enabled by
a unanimous vote and with the con
currence of the. Mayor to "temporarily
suspend" the dollar limit provision. of
the charter and to levy a tax in excess
of such limit whenever a great neces
sity or emergency so requires. 1
MAYOR APPROVES ACTION.
DIS3IISSA3J OF APPEAL.
In the opinion of City Attorney
Percy V. Long handed to the Board of
Supervisors yesterday in the matter
of the return of money collected
under a special tax levy, for public
schools and the new City and County
Hospital, the resolution to refund such
money to the taxpayers owing to the
invalidity of the law is upheld by the
City Attorney. The principal reason
for the refunding: of the tax levy
is that the recent Issue of municipal
bonds, that has ,been declared j valid
by the Supreme Court, generously
covers appropriations for new schools
and a new City and County Hospital.
The result of the decision will be that
the city treasury may have to refund
over $325,000 to taxpayers who have
paid, assessments under the levy.
Many firms have suits pending
against the city to recover "the amount
of taxes paid into the" city treasury
under the old assessment. From these
the City Attorney selected a test case,
upon which a decision _was rendered
by Judges Seawell and Sloss, declar
ing that the special levying of taxes
for the schools and the hospital was
invalid. -

hungry â¢ Just as he Â¦ bolted," said Mcln,
tbsh to the detectives. "I -was bent on
getting; the.. sack away from him or I
might have held him until assistance
arrived."
Detective Bell of the Police Depart
ment, who is regularly detailed to
watch the banks, had visited the First
National only a few minutes before the
attempted robbery. Policeman Walsh,
whose beat Is in the district, had also
been in the bank a few minutes after 12
o'clock. When the attempted robbery
occurred Bell and Walsh were walking
up Sansome street, south of California.
A citizen approached them and said, "A
man Just â¢ stole some money from .the
First National." Both Bell and Walsh
hurried -to the bank and: secured as
much testimony as possible that might
furnish a clew. Mr. Mclntosh described
the robber aa a young man, 5 feet 10 or
way," the stranger pointing down Bush
street toward Market. The stranger
was not seen thereafter. Hooper re
turned to the bank for a few seconds and
in the meanwhile the stranger disap
peared.
Detective Bell is not Inclined to be
lieve that the thief had an accomplice.
Had that been the case the accomplice
would have attempted to stop Mcln
tosh from pursuing his man; he aajr*.-;
Detective John Martin â¢ thinks that
the thief may have been a roomer at
the Brooklyn Hotel and had planned to
carry the sack into his room.; The day
clerk < did .. not get a good look at tha
man and could not say whether he had
seen him around the hotel before or
hot. The police hope to develop some
thing on this line of Investigation.

The' football season was ushered in
yesterday morning with two games by
the Academic Athletic League play
ers. On the. Presidio athletic grounds
the eleven representing the Poly
technic High School beat the stal
warts from Lowell High by a score
of 10 to 0. On the recreation grounds
ar Golden Gate Park the Mission
High School team defeated Wil
merding easily. Wilmerding failed to
score, while Mission piled up a total
16 points.
The polytechnic-Lowell game was
close and interesting and for the first
game of the season the players
showed considerable team work. In
the first half Polytechnic scored twice.
In the second half the Lowell players

fought them for every Inch and ths re
sult was that neither side scored.
The weight was with Polytechnic
and in the first half they had a de
cided advantage. The kicking of
Bonifleld for the winning team netted
them many yards. Lowell was rather
weak in punting. and lost considerable
ground in each Exchange of punts.
Captain Cerf of Lowell played a
great game and with but little assist
ance from his team mates made sev
eral long runs.
Boardman, -prho captained the Mis
sion team last year, played left half
for Polytechnic and was that team's
most consistent ground gainer. Boni
fleld failed at both trials for goal.
The grounds at the park wera
found to be poor for playing football.
The grass was wet and the players
could not get a footing. There were
no lines and the officials had a hard
time deciding upon first downs. The
game was devoid of sensational fea
tures except for a thirty-yard run by
Cook of Wilmerding in the second
half.

Stanford opened the game with â¢ a
kick along the ground for twenty
yards. â¢ The visitors made two inef
fectual jabs at the opposing line and
McFadden punted back thirty yards.
Stanford failed to make much progress
and McDonald made a ladylike little
kick over the side lines. Slaker found
some weak spots in the cardinal
armor and things were going along
swimmingly for the Olympic Club
when some one held In the line and
back went the pigskin for twenty
yards. For the remainder of the half
the ball see-sawed back and forth near

Stott atjthe beginning of the second
session 'sna'the little chap dodged back
over three of the horizontal stripes.
Stanford tried some rotary plays and
was boring in pretty well when Stott
fumbled near the center of the field.
McFadden, of the Olympics, pulled the
pigskin from' the air and set out for
the goal posts. Stott nailed him on
the ten-yard line, while an audible
sigh of relief went up from the bleach
ers.
SLAKER MAKES A TOUCHDOWN.
But the Olympic, boys were now
geared up for action, and -it would have
taken a coast defense gun to stop them.
After a preliminary rush Slaker wan
dered between tackle and end on the
cardinal right and landed the leather
on the greensward beyond the goal
line. Smock did not come even near
to kicking the goal. Once during the
remainder of the game Stanford got
down to Olympic's twenty-yard line,
but the visitors kicked out of danger.

With a* bis "rah, rah, rah" from a
thousand lusty throats and a crash of
music from' the college band the foot
ball season for 1304 was opened yester
day at Palo Alto. For forty strenuous
and joyful minutes the Stanford young
sters battled with ths gridiron experts
of the Olympic Club. When it was all
over the cardinal detachment had b^en
routed to the tune of ."â¢ to 0.
\ To be sure, the playing was loose, in
terference was left out of the jrama
and* the punts were almost jokes, bm it
was football ance again and the ains
of omjfslon and of commission were
easily forgiven. The score was largely
accidental and the opposing : force3
were pretty evenly matched. Lanagan
switched his -men so often thatjwhtte
the spectators were looking at a player
he turned into somebody else. ;
"Express men and bank messengers
are continually coming and going from
the bank with sacks of coin," said Mr.
Mclntosh, "and it was the unusual
sight of seeing a man in an ordinary
business suit leaving the premises from
the direction of the collection desk with
so large* a sum of money." ,
Mr. Mclntosh - slipped from behind
his counter and . hurried toward the
front door. He thought.it was possible
that a Wells-Fargo Express wagon was
in front of the building and . that â¢ the
man would throw the -sack into it.
Murti to his ; astonishment the robber
turned the corner at Bush street and
walked rapidly toward; Montgomery.
He turned aside at the Brooklyn Hotel
and entered, with, Mclntosh after him.

man hadrobbed the bank,".
Through the hotel lobby the man

"I had some small cash and stepped
out of the room for a few seconds to
hand it to the -paying teller. The door
of the room did not close behind me.
The thief must have followed close at
my heels, for 'my back was turned a
very few seconds. He lifted one of the
sacks. . which weighs " about seventy
pounds', and coolly walked out That is
all I know about it."
.Assistant Cashier Mclntosh continued
the story, adding the Interesting fea
tures of the daring work of the des
perate man. Mclntosh said that had
the man been dressed as an express
man it is doubtful whether he would
have thought . anything, on seeing a
person leave the. bank with a sack of
coin on his shoulder. : ' .: / ?./;
"At the bank entrance I took charge
of . the bags and carried them into my
room and placed them on the counter
some distance from the door..
"After leaving the sub-treasury," he
said, "I came by the most direct route
to the bank. I did not notice that any
oria was following the wagon, but I
think. that the fellow: must have, seen
me come out of the sub-treasury and
have hurried along back of the wagon.
We drove slowly.
The messengers' room is to the -right
of the collection desk at the further end
of the main bankings room. It is a
space ,abc-ut ten feet square, separated
from the outer. offices by a woven wire
grating, set oh top of the dividing .par

HANKERS PUZZLED.
It" was shortly after the noon hour
when the attempt at robbery was
made. The rnair. flcor of the bank Was
crowded with people and the tellers and
clerks were all very much occupied.
Messenger Erenr.ar. arrived at the cor
ner of Bush and Fansome streets on an
express v.njri-n in which he had placed
two sacks of srpld. eac'n containing $20,

ALAMEDA, Sept. 17. â The Berke
ley High School eleven defeated the
team representing the Alameda' High
School to-day on the field at the cor
ner of Clement avenue and Walnut
street by a score of 6 to 0. Notwith
standing- the numerous fumbles made
by the players on both side, the frame
was fast and exciting. The touchdown
was scored by the winners In the first
half. The local punters were much
lighter than their opponents, but they
made a stubborn stand against the
Berkeley lads. In the second half the
sphere was generally in Alameda ter
ritory and was several timeirwithln
'twenty yards of the r goal," ' but the
splendid defensive tactics of the home
team prevented the visitors from-add
ing to their score. Among the play
ers who distinguished themselves were
Russell. Baker,. Oscar Belcher, Frank
Jeckson and Byron Paul.

Mr. Jackson, formerly of Texas,
may have had visions of fame and
fortune in store for him in the Pa
cific Coast League, but the awaken
ing yesterday at Recreation Park was
cruel and rode. The first time out the
young man was treated to the kind
of support that is all yellow and as
wide as the lot The Angels did as
they pleased and the score was 10
to 0.
This does not mean that the young
man cannot pitch baseball. Far from
It. He was not a shining light yes
terday, yet he showed he really pos
sessed something:, and with a team be
hind him that would play ball he. In
all probability. Is capable of making
a better showing by far. He is cool
and has good curves and fair con
trol. His main weakness seems to be
In fielding his position.
The way Baum pitched and the way
hÂ« was supported was a vast contrast.
This jonng product of the native snil
had everything, not barring the best
kind of backing a pitcher can look
for. The Commuters were utterly
mystified in every inning. The only
way they could possibly get on the
sacks was by clouting the ball, and
this Eaum positively refused to let
them do.
The Angels started off in a gallop
in the third round, when Francks
made a fumble. This was followed by
a couple of hits and some shifty work
en the part of the Angels that netted
a pair of runs in all. A pass to Baum,
followed by Bernard's sizzling double
and Flood's out soon out another to
the pood. Still another was added in
the next period on an error and a
paf<? drive.
The big explosion of the day, how
ever, was held in reserve till the clos
ing spasm. Then all the Oakland
players tried to outdo each other in
the making of errors. The Angels be
came busy with their clubs in the
meantime and ere the avalanche
<ould be checked five more southern
ers darted over the sacks and the
grand total of the day was swelled to
ten. The score:

representatives of six other high
schools represented in the San Fran
cisco Athletic League yesterday after
noon on the oval at the University of
California. Lick piled up the score
all afternoon and at the end had 60
points. Lowell had 32 points, Mission
19, Polytechnic 11, Wilmerdingr 9 and
Cogswell and the Commercial 6 each.
Lick's score was helped out materi
ally by the phenomenal work of Moul
len, a sturdy youth, who Is handy with
the weights. Moullen carried off
three firsts for a total of fifteen points
and broke two records. In the pole
vault Moullen added six Inches to the
record, making it 10 feet 6 inches, and
In the hammer throw added 10 feet
to the record, so that It now stands at
152 feet.
Walker, another of Lick's clever
representatives, won the broad jump
with the excellent showing of 18 feet
9 inches. He will be heard from again
in this event.
The track events, except the per
formance of Maundrell of Lowell in
the mile, vere not above the ordinary.
Maundrell cut the San Francisco
academic record in the mile from
4:48 3-5 to 4:42 during a race In
which he led all the way and barely
missed equaling the Academic Ath
letic League record of 4:41 2-5. Maun

been pressed would have made mince

In to-day's race there was no. fast
horse to set the pace and this import
ant part of the contest was assumed by
Major Daingerfleld, which /bounded
along In front for a mile and five fur
longs. Just a half mile from the finish
it was apparent Major Daingerfleld had
done all the pacemaking he could or
would and then it .was that O'Neil let
Africander do a little running. At ihat
same instant Redfern relaxed his hold
on McChesriey and the two drew away
from Major Daingerfleld as if he were
glued to the ground.
Less than a quarter of a mile from
home Africander had a trifling advant
age, as he made a closer turn than did
McChesney. In spite of this," however,
McChesney was coming on after Afri
cander so - resolutely that O'Neil was
forced to use his whip once on his
mount. This drove Redfern to the whip
also,- and for a few strides it seemed
McChesney might draw up on even
terms. It was only a short lived hope,
as Africander drew slowly away and
passed the judges amid a hurricane of
applause a scant length in front of Mc-
Chesney, while nearly eighty yards
away came Major Daingerfleld. Sum

the front with a lead of six lengths and
increased it all the way, except for a
brief moment at the stretch turn, where

In the fall of 1895 1-contracted that fear-
ful disease, Blood Poison. It gained such
headway that I was forced to resign my
position and seek relief at Hot Springs.
After spending all the means I had I went
to Memphis. In less than three weeks I
was in a hospital, and after nine weeks of
suffering I was discharged as cured. In
less than a month every bone in my body
seemed to be affected and felt as if they
would break at the least exertion. Again
I was compelled to lesigu, and I returned
to the hospital for a seven weeks stay.
When I came out I was advised to try
fanning. When I first went on the farm I
prevailed on the only firm who handled
drugs to get xne one dozen bottles of S. S.
S. At that time both of my hands were
broken out with blisters and I was covered
with boils and sores. In the meantime my
druggist had gotten two dozen bottles of
S. S. S. for me and I began its use, and
after taking the thirteenth bottle not a
sore or boil was visible. R. B. Powell.

PARIS, Sept. 17.â The grand maneu
vers Just concluded at Dijon have
shown the development of scientific
warfare since the Franco-German war.
The guns throw shells which burst into
240 deadly fragments, whereas the
shells used In the war of 1870-71 burst
into only thirty. The present French
shrapnel* shells are calculated to scat
ter 400 deadly particles, whereas the
former shrapnel shells scattered only
thirty -seven. General Brugare, the
commander-In-chief, emphasized the
necessity of the army concealing itself
and exposing the enemy during action.
Therefore, powerful searchlights were
successfully used to disclose the move
ments of the enemy. Old-fashioned
black powder was used to create a cur
tain concealing the army's advance.
Captain Bentley Mott, the American'
military attache, and other foreign at
taches speak in the highest terms of
the efficiency of the French troops.

RENO. Sep. 17.â Free gold int paying
quantities was found in the bottom of
the new reservoir of the Hunter Creek
Water Company to-day. The company is
headed by Governor John Sparks. For
several months the construction of the
reservoir has been in progress. It is
being built on bedrock. It was on the
hard surface that the glittering metal
was discovered to-day. ' t
Heretofore it has not been thought
that mineral existed in that section,
which is two miles southwest of Reno.

On this basis it is found that thÂ«
reads of Europe represent an invest

of the rest of the world average $57.

ures standing at $256,839. while those
of Belgium come next with $150,239.
The least expensive government roads
of Europe are those in Finland. Their
cost is put at $32,104 per, mile. Pri
vate roads in Sweden, however, are es
timated at only $22,558 per jnile-
The narrow gauge roads of Japan.
Tvhere such construction - obtains
largely, have consumed $33,320 per
mile: and those of West Australia,
which are also narrow gauge, with
very light rails, represent an invest
ment of $27,950 per mile.
From the reports of the Interstate
Commerce Commission It is impossible
to draw comparisons between the roads
of other countries and those of the
United States. While the capitalization
of all' the roads in the world in June,
1902, was put at $34,964,342,000. those of
the United States represented a capi
talization of $12,134,182,964 at that time;
and a year later ' this had been in
creased to $12,599,990,258. The capitali
zation per mile amounts to $63,153.
The progress of the. world in railroad
building Is shown by the, following fig
ures: In 1S96 there .were 'added to the
total 9.768 miles; in 1897, 10,747 miles;
in 1898 r 10.864 miles; In 1839. 13,533 miles;
in 1900, 10,800 miles; In 1901, 16,551 miles,
and in 1092. 13,338 miles.
. This makes a total of 85.629 miles. in
the seven vears and is an average of
12.233 miles a year. From 1880 to 1890
the mileage built was 'the greatest, the
yearly average being 15,218.
The noticeable decrease .In construc
tion from 1901 to 1902 whs due chiefly
to Â¦ reductions in Asia, from 4345 miles
in 1901 to 2535 in .1902, and Africa,
where construction . decreased from
1690 miles in 1901 to 364, ia l>02. â

Of the $34,694,342,000 which had
been invested in the world's railroads
at the close of 1902 it Is estimated
that more than $18,800,000,000 has
been spent on 184,000 miles of Euro
pean railroad and $16,160,000,000 on
the 337.000 miles owned by the rest
of the world.
Of*the total the New World has 52hi
per cent and North America alone has
4 4.VJ per cent. The mileage of the
United States alone is about 207,000,
as the report of the Interstate Com
merce Commission shows: and this is
40 per cent of the total railroad mile
age of* the earth.
The world's railroad mileage at the
close of the year 1902 was 520.995
miles, representing an investment of
$24,964,342,000. Comparing the rail
road mileage of the Old World with
that of the new the Archivf uer Eissen

"Persons posting letters should affix
the requisite number of stamps pre

receivers, as when posted In a damp

and thereby cause the letters to be
treated as unpaid. Do not pin on the
stamps."
"Still," said the clerk, "the public
didn't - understand. Think or it â it
didn't understand the matter of stick
ing a postage stamp on a letter. So
\vÂ»f got out a third bulletin."
The third bulletin, in big. impatient
ltttersÂ», said: "The simplest and most
effectual. method of causing stamps to
adhere nrmly Is first to moisten well
the outside of the stamps and after
ward the gummed side slightly, taking
care not to remove the gum."
He put back this bulletin and drev.
forth another one. "People would pin
the stamps on their letters instead of
gumming them." he said, "and when
they did gum them they would not do
it right. Hence this second bulletin,"
and he read:
"When postage stamps first came
into use," said a veteran postal clerk
on the Texas Pacific Railway the other
day, "the public didn't know how to
handle them. You remember how.
when tea and coffee first appeared
among us. the people fried the tea
leaves and the coffee berries, and
served them with salt and pepper?
Well, the people treated their stamps
as absurdly in 1854. Some folks would
put the stamps inside their letters, out
of sight. Here is the official notice that
we Issued to stop that practice."
The clerk took from the drawer an
aged bulletin that paid: "The stamps
upon all letters and packages must be
affixed on the outside thereof and
above the address thereon."

the surplus Is $35,203,850. Loans were

a reduction in surplus reserve by an
amount about equal to that of the pre

serve of $28,022,250 since the week
ending September 3 inclusive. The
surplus reserve now stands $16,179,525
above that of the corresponding week
a year ago; in 1902 there was a de
ficiency of $1,642,050. The decrease
, in cash last week was $8,500,800, or
$1,627,500 greater than the estimated
decrease which was Dased. upon the
traceable movements of money during
the week; the discrepancy may in part
be accounted for by the fact that there

day of $900,000 â $500,000 for tranter
to San Francisco and $400,000 to New
Orleans, which sums were not includ

were increased $2,497,200 and thereby
the required reserve was augmented

Conductor L. H. Osborn of the San
Mateo line reported to the police last
night that at 11:50 P. m. his car had
been boarded by a footpad, who robbed
him of JSO. The robber escaped.
The hold-up occurred when the car
â¢was opposite the Masonic Cemetery,
near Colaa. According to Conductor
Osborn. the footpad suddenly boarded
the car and. pointing a blue-barreled
8ml th & Wesson revolver In Osborn's
race, cried, "Shell out, old man, and be
Quick about it." Osborn says he lost
no time in complying with the demand.
As soon as the conductor had given
up his cash the thief Jumped from the
caj and disappeared In the darkness.
Osborn says the footpad was about
6 feet 2 inches in height and wore a
blue "Jumper," blue overalls and a
blue cap. This deÂ«riptlon answers
that griven of the man who is said to
have held up another San Mateo car
rear the same spot about three weeks
ago. Osborn adds that the robber
wore a white handkerchief as a mask
over his face. The police are Inves

Despite the damp weather, which
plays havoc with tennis rackets, the
courts at the park and those of the
California Club accommodated many
players yesterday. On the public
courts the most interesting tournament
was held by the women players since
the reorganization of their club. It was
a class singles event for players of the
second and third classes. Most of the
players are young ladies who are new
to the game, but those in the second
class showed considerable skill. Some
of the matches were the most stub
bornly contested ever seen at the park.
In the finales of the second class the
contestants were so evenly matched
that honors were even when darkness
set in In the third set. The young
ladles who figured in this match were
Miss Annabelle Vodden and Miss Wor
cester. Miss Vodden won the honors
in this class in the last tournament
easily. Miss Worcester i3 a left handed
player too competed at San Rafael.
The experience she gained there is re
sponsible for the showing she' made
yesterday.
The first set which Miss Worcester
won by a 12-10 score is the longest ever
played by women at the park. The
next set was also close, but went to
Miss Vodden by a 6-4 score. The third
set stood 7-7 when darkness came to
the rescue of the almost exhausted
young ladles. The final set will be
played next week.
Another close match in this class was
that in which Miss Vodden beat Miss
Crocker. The first two sets both went
to deuce.
In the third class a new champion
developed. Miss Van Vleit, a clever
young player who has been practicing
on the Presidio courts, was much too
strong for the other contestants. In
the finals she lost but one game in two
sets. In future she will play in the
second class.
Some exceptionally good practice
game3 were played on the club courts.
Champion MacGavin was out for the
first time since he won his title and
beat Dr. McChesney two sets. In dou
bles, Rolfe and Schmidt tied Allen and
Crawford in a fast match. MacGavin
and Busch lost two sets to Dr. Sumner
Hardy and Dr. Hill.

"No, sir," replied the old farmer In

bring a description of Barr.e to our office, stat-
in, what kind of property you prefer In ex-
change, and you will be surprised how quickly
wo can effect the result.
THIS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE UNDER-
STAND THE EXCHANGE BUSINESS and are

specialty of same. We make no charge for ad-
vertising or any other purpose unless we pro-
ct.re an exchange satisfactory to you to accept.

"But the most interesting fire is al
ways a blaze in Darktown. If you
want to see a lot of excited people you
ought to get into the midst of a small
conflagration in Darktown at night.
The negroes begin to empty the
houses of their contents for blocks
around. That is fun enough, but' the
real fun commences when they try to
get' their goods back into their houses,
for it is a. sort of grab game, every
body taking everything they can get
hold of. I'll bet that after- a. fire in
Darktown there isn't a house in the
neighborhood of the blaze that was

In order to preserve the features <f
those who have died it Is proposed -by
a Russian to embalm corpses by. cast
ing around them a solid mass of -glass.
This would be perfectly transparent
ana as no air could get in at the fea
tures' would, be preserved indefinitely.
Of course, Jt Is not possible to pour
molten glass directly on the body, so
it is first coated : with a thin- coating
of so-called "liquid glass." or sodium
silicate. This is allowed to harden and
forms a protective coating. The body
is then put in a mold and melted glass
poured around it. When this Is hard
ened we have a solid, transparent mass
inclosing the body. The Inventor of
this process hopes ' that some day wÂ»
will have a large museum filled with
the perfectly preserved bodies of -the
great men of their . times for, future
generations, to gaxd upon.â Collier's

A cold-blooded scheme for prevent

which is a favorite speedway for

Police is In the center of this stretch.
In front of the offlce^a groove. will be
cut in the paving and In this will be
set a knife blade extending the width
of the street. A lever In the police
station will raise thl.i knife about two
inches above the level of the pave

happen to the occupants of the car

Into the calculation. They may be
thrown out and killed, but the nollce
will have the satisfaction of having
stopped the vehicle and having ruined
about $100 Â¦' worth- of- tires. '- A cheaper
and equally effective plan would seem
to be to use a double-barrel shotgun

The Credit-Anstalt, the largest bank
ing institution of the Austrian empire,
has contributed as. a silent partner of
the concern 1,000,000 crowns ($203,000) to
the working capital of the exporting
firm of Alois Schwelger of Vienna. This
firm, having a capital of Its own of
500,000 crowns (5101.500), is engaged' in
exporting Austrian manufactures to
China and Japan. With its capital in
creased it will now open'branch offices
in Hamburg, London, China and Japan.
This firm was the pioneer for the Aus
trian export trade to Eastern Asia.
In Europe the banks are the backers
âin many cases the prime movers â of
great ventures, such as the construc
tion of railroads at home and in foreign
countries, the establishment of steam
ship lines and financial institutions,
colonization enterprises, the operating
of mines and the promoting of facto
ries and industrial undertakings in for
eign countries. It Is due largely to this
financial aid by their great banking in
stitutions that Germany, France, Bel

such large business interests in foreign
countries, thereby giving employment
to manufacturing interests at home and

There are three quartz mining dis
tricts In the Transvaal. The Lyden
burg district was discovered in 1876;
the product for 1898 from four-com
panies, operating 135 stamps, was
valued at Â£392,378. The, De Kaap
gold fields were discovered in 1884,
and in 1898 seven companies, with
200 stamps, produced gold valued at
Â£314,792. But by far the most im
portant district in the famous Wit
watersrand (White Waters Range) of
Johannesburg, consisting of almost a
continuous outcropping of over thirty
miles in length, passing through the
city of Johannesburg and extending
about half that distance on either side.
The veins consist of practically
parallel beds of quartz pebble con
glomerate, impregnated with gold.
These beds are known in South Africa
as "reefs," equivalent to "ledges" or
"lodes" in America. The first openings
were made along the outcrop and fol
lowed the dip of the vein, which aver
ages 35 degrees, usually being some
what steeper at the surface and flat
tening as it goes down. . In 1898 the
output -of seventy-seven companies
operating 11 stamp batteries produced
gold to; the value of Â£15,141,376. The

4765, while in 1899 5762 stamps were

There is a young man in town who
Is newly come out of the West and if
you ask a certain Rhode Island ave
nue girl about him you will be very
likely to hear a most disparaging ac
count of his manners. . It happened
this way: Last summer the Rhode
Island avenue girl went out to the
western town where this young man
was born and brought up to visit
friends. .Everybody was exceedingly
cordial to her, and possibly this gave
her an . undue, idea, of her own im
portance. ' . ' . :
At any rate she took it upon her
self to criticise the West and western
ways in a fashion that is far from
pleasant to Westerners, though, good
ness knows, they've heard it long
enough to be pretty well hardened.
The young man I am telling you
about took her driving one evening
and it happened that she was in an
unusually critical mood. She made
fun of the town and the people and
pointed out wherein they were lack
ing in the essentials of civilization
till the young man felt that her re
marks were getting on^his-nerves.
"Things are so different* here from
what they- are in Washington," she
said. I "Why, at home really nice girls
never go driving in the evening with
men."
The young man's patience snapped
off short. He looked at the girl with
a .smile. " ' ".
"It's the same here,". he said coolly.
"That's why we fellows have to take
girls from out of town."â Washington
Post.

Tunnel Bridge for English Channel.
Since a .French engineer named
Gamond planned a submarine tunnel
in 1857, various projects have been
advanced for connecting England with
the Continent. The latest is the sug
gestion of Bunau-Varilla, who wants
to build a tunnel to , within three
kilometres of England r and thence a
bridge, whieh England (which has not
favored a tunnel) could destroy at any
time in case of danger of a foreign
invasion; thus rendering the tunnel
useless.
Mixed Metaphors mid Bulls Made In
.. Offhand Speeches Made by
Englishmen.
Following are Instances of queer
blunders in offhand parliamentary
speeches, " says the London Spectator.
"Sir, we are told that by this legis
lation the heart of the country has
been shaken to its very foundations."
"I am only too thankful that we
have removed one of these miserable
barbed wire entanglements and - that
we find ourselves in smooth waters at
last."
"The Secretary of the Education
Department was the father of a state
ment of which the bottom was
knocked out by those who followed
him in the second reading debate, yet
the honorable member for St. Pancras
has thought fit to trot it out again."
"Among the many jarring notes
heard in this house on military affairs
this subject at least must be regarded
as an oasis."
"The interests of the employers and
employed are the same nine times out
of ten â -I will even say ninety-nine
times out of ten."
"Our tongues are tied, our hands
are fettered and we are really beating
the air to no purpose."
"I will now repeat what I was about
to say when the honorable member
interrupted me." ,
"The West Indies will now have a
future which they never had in the
past."
"A thorny subject which has long
been a bone of contention amonff us."
"A slumbering volcano which at
any moment a spark might set
aflame." â Exchange.
. About a score of English maids and
matrons, well bred, intelligent and of
the upper ten, were lately in evidence
in the lobby of one of Washington's
best hostelries for about a week. Dur
ing the stay of the fair ones from
abroad they were the objects of much
curious attention. People seemed to
know at a glance that they were
foreigners.
"Yes, the women of England, do look
queer alongside ours," said the wife of
a Congressman, when appealed to for
an explanation. "There are several im
portant points of di.Terence. In the
first place they do not as a rule possess
good figures, neither, do they carry
themselves with the grace and ease
that are so common with all classes
of women in this country. But the par
ticular, distinction after all is in the
matter of dress. An English woman's
clothes scarcely ever sit on her be
comingly, even if they were made to
fit, which is rare. They are not up to
the American standard in the knowl
edge of arranging themselves in gar
ments - that show off the good points
in the female form. Of the French
chic in dress they are densely Igno
rant. See that young British female
over there with the long neck, which,
Instead of being partly concealed, Is
wholly revealed by the absence of a
collar. No Yankee girl would ever sin
against good taste that way." â Wash

SOME QUEEI1 BLUNDERS
31ADE IX PARLIAMENT
Some Maori laundresses using' one of
the hot pools in the reserve at Wha
karewarewa had a strange experience
recently. Having put the clothes in
the pool, the girls accompanied some
visitors round the reserve, states the
Hot Lakes Chronicle, and Just as they
were returning to the pool in which
they had deposited the clothes they
were more than surprised to see the
"washing" violently thrown into the
air, with each eruption of the geyser
that had broken out In the pool. The
Maoris could do nothing but look on,
and while doing so they witnessed a
portion of their clothing suddenly dis
appear Into the mouth of the geyser.
After bemoaning the loss of their gar
ments to their friends, and all were
about to move away, one of the party
picked up a lady's purse which had
been shot out of the pool. It was well
saturated with water. In the purse
was a greenstone brooch, the pin of
which had become disconnected. On
the greenstone, in gold letters, was the
name "Lucy." How long the purse had
been In the pool it Is difficult to say, but
beyond being saturated with water, it
was in a good state of preservation. â
Auckland News.
Freaks of a Geyser.
A member of the French Academy
of Science Is said to be enjoying sea
breezes in his Paris home by manu
facturing a liquid which he diffuses
through the air of his apartment. The
recipe for the compound is given as
follows: In ten volumes of oxygenat
ed water containing a hundredth part
of ether charged with some ozone he
dissolves a small quantity of sea salt.
By means of a vaporizer this liquid Is
distributed in the. air at the rate of 120
grammes per hour. It is said that by
this means the apartment becomes
saturated with the scent of the sea and
that the slightest draught of air cre
ates the illusion of a wind sweeping
over a sandy beach .direct from the
wide waters of the Atlantic Ocean.
One's faith is not strengthened,
however, when the narrative proceeds
to relate how this ingenious scientist,
while inhaling this mixture,- seats- him
self in his armchair, with his eyes
closed, and "listens to. the lapping of
the waves while breathing their odor,"
for he holds to his ear a shell in which
he can hear the murmur of the rest
less sea. Such an attitude and occu
pation seeems more fitting for an old
poet than for a professional man of
science. â Washington Star. .

The peculiar. business methods of Ori
ental merchants are illustrated by the
manner of buying rubies in Burma. In
the examination of ruoiea artificial
light is not used, the merchants hold
ing that full sunlight alone can bring
out -the color - and brilliancy of the
eems. Sales must, therefore, take place
between 9 a. m. and 3 p. m., and the
sky must be clear.
. The purchaser, placed near a' window,
has before him a large copper plate.
The sellers come to him one by one,
and each empties upon this plate his
little bag of rubles.- . The purchaser
proceeds to arrange them for valuation
in a number of small heaps. The first
division is into three grades, according
to size; each of these piles in turn is
again divided Into three piles, accord
ing to color, and each of these piles in
turn is again divided into three groups,
according to shape. The bright copper
plate has a curious use. ' The sunlight
reflected from it through the stones
brings out, with true rubies, a jcolor ef
fect different from that with red spin
els and tourmalines, which are thus
easily separated.
The buyer and seller then go through
a very peculiar method of bargaining
by signs, or father grips, in perfect
silence. After agreeing upon the fair
ness of the classification they Join their
right hands, covered with a handker
chief or the flap of a garment, and by
grips and pressures mutually under
stood among all these dealers they
make, modify and accept proposals of
purchase and sale. The hands are then
uncovered and the prices are recorded.

It has been discovered that a modifi
cation of the telephone can be made
use of for the purpose of improving
the hearing of persons "afflicted with
deafness. "While this scheme Is not al
ways beneficial, it has been found to
afford great relief to a large number of
persons. Of recent years inventors
have devoted themselves to the con
struction of instruments of this char
acter in the most convenient form and
of such shape that they can be used
without attracting unnecessary atten
tion. There has been recently patented
In this country, the work c-f an Austra
lian inventor, an Installation of this
character which can be stowed away
in any ordinary derby hat, the only
portion of the apparatus exposed to
view being two ear tubes which depend
from the sides of the hat and repose
in the ears. The sound collecting bells
are adroitly concealed in the sides of
the hat crown.
An umbrella Is generally regarded as
an awkward thing to carry at its best.
Any one can think of a dozen reasons
why it is in the way and a confusing
problem to deal with under ordinary
circumstances. In a town called Gibs
land. La,, a man has invented an um
brella that is supported over the owner
by a system of rods and which leaves
both of his hands free to be used as
occasion demands. It is hardly neces
sary to attempt an elaboration upon
the merits of this device. /'â¢-â¢
As the rowing season is about to
open it will be gratifying to timid
young women to learn that a boat has
been invented which is said to be ab
solutely proof against the fool man
who Insists on rocking the craft. This
is done by a simple attachment of a
piece of metal to the keel of the boat,
which the inventor says does not in
the least interfere with the progress
of the boat through the water, but
makes it impossible to Interfere with
its stability in the water. The device,
which is the patent of William M.
Young of Troy. X. Y.. consists of a
piece of metal extending the length of
the boat and fastened to the keel and
extending at right angles with the keel
for a short distance and then curved
upward to meet the framework of the
boat at the water line. Under ordinary
circumstances this is not visible and
does not alter the lines of.the craft and,
being open at each end, does not. im
pede its progress through the water,
but any attempt being made to rock
the boat is rendered exceedingly diffi
cult because of the weight of water
held in the space between the boat's
side and the attachment. . ' -
A Larse Number of New TbJnss
Brought Out for New
Needs.
When China found herself arrayed
against Japan she offered $500 cash a
month for skilled gun- pointers, but in
all great navies gun pointers are
trained, not bought, and when the fight
is on it is too late for instruction.
How does a man become an expert
gunner? Diligent drill and constant
training are not enough, without a
certain amount, of natural aptitude.
One man after another is tried. A few
days' drill in the turrets eliminates all
except the fairly promising. For the
talent of eye and nerve which makes
the born gun pointer the Government
pays from $2 to $10 a month in addi
tion . to the regular pay. . This pre
mium is not confined to any race, creed
or color. On one vessel in the navy
one of the gun pointers Is a negro.
Selecting gun pointers is one of the
most important duties of the navy.
Having selected the men for gun point
ers, the next step Is to train them. Two
methods are now in vogue, both having
the same principle, but differing in de
tail. In the old days of sails and
smooth-bore guns the invariable rule â
and the only rule the gun captains
knewâ was this: "Fire at the top of
the downward roll (just as the ship
begins to roll toward the target), and
aim at the enemy's water line."
This rule lasted far. into the age of
steam and turret guns, and has only
recently been supplanted by "continu
ous aim firing," or the art of keeping
a gun trained on the target, regardless
of the oscillation of the vessel, duiing
the whole or a portion of the roll.
The method of training men by the
new system â by the use of a "dotter"â
was devised by Captain Percy Scott of
the British navy. The dotter is a me
chanical device which causes a small
target to move across the face of a
gun, with a combined vertical and hori
zontal .motion. The gun pointer must
make the gun follow the target, and
whenever the sights are on the bulls
eye he presses a button. This causes
a pencil to dot the target. Thai is his
shct. The other method of instruction
is with the Morris tube, which consists
of a small gallery rifle fitted on the
gun, to take the place of the dotter's
pencil.
So proficient have the bluejackets be
come in handling the turret guns that
in -actual target practice on board the
Alabama a 13-inch gun is loaded and
fired in thirty-eight seconds. Two kinds
of target practice are employed now in
all navies, one in which the target is
stationary and the ship moving; the
other in which both ship and target are
moving. â Washington Star.

One of the most curious plants In the
world 'is the one described by travelers
'recently returned from the Cape Negro
colony, a little known region of Africa,
and called the spider plant. These
travelers often heard from the natives
of a plant that- was part spider and
that, growing, threw its legs about in
continual struggles to escape. It was
the .good fortune of Dr. "Welwitsch to
discover the origin of the legend. Strol
ling along through a wind-swept table
land country he came upon a plant that
rested low on the ground, but had two
enormous leaves that twisted about in
the wind like serpentsâ in fact, it
looked, as the natives had said, like a
gigantic spider.
Its stem was four feet across and but
a foot high. It had but two leaves in
reality, that were six or eight feet long
and split up by the wind so that they
resembled ribbons. This is probably
the most extraordinary tree known. It
grows* for nearly, if not quite, a cen
tury, but never upward beyond about a
foot, simply expanding until it reaches
the diameter given, looking in its adult
state like a singular stool on the plain
from ten to eighteen feet in circum
ference.
When the wind came rushing in from
the sea, lifting the curious ribbonlike
leaves and tossing them about, it al
most seemed to the discoverer that the
strange plant had suddenly become Im
bued with life and was struggling to
escape. When, a description and pic
ture of the plant were sent to England
it was, like many other discoveries, dis
credited, but soon the plant itself was
received and now .Welwitschla mira
bilis is well known to botanists.â New
