i-RESNO. Oct. 16.â A broken switch
lock smashed by the hands of a .mis
creant caused a fatal train wreck in the
Southern Pacific yard at Fresno at 2:40
o'clock this morning. The northbound
passenger train, the Owl, struck the
cocked switch. left the rails, bumped
over the ties for 100 feet and then the
engine suddenly turned completely over.

A. G. Knickerbocker of San Francisco, a
tramp, was injured internally and prob
ably will die. - â¢
That none of the passengers or others
of the crew were injured is considered
little short of a miracle. The wrecked
engine. No. 1452, was an oil burner, and
when it was overturned the oil ran out
upon the ground. That it did not ignite
and set fire to the cars behind is a mar
vel. When the engine turned turtle the
I lender did also. The combination mail
and baggage car remained erect, but Its
front end was boosted high into the air
and rested upon the tender, where it re
mained. Its forward trucks Trere torn
loose and plowed forward into the de
tached trucks of the engine and tender,
and all l&y a mass of twisted steel be
eide the engine, the pilot of which was
burled deep in the earth.
MAIL. CLERKS SHAKEN.
TWo other cars left the track, the buf
fet car and a sleeper. The sleeper was
righted and proceeded with the train an
hour and a half later, when a new engine
steamed away with it to San Francisco.
The mail clerks were badly shaken, but
none were seriously Injured. AH were
able to stay at their posts. Few of the
passengers had any suspicion that a ter
rible accident had happened, and some of
them were not even awakened by the
Jolting of the cars. .
â¢That the wreck was the work of a fiend
because of a desire to wreak vengeance
egalnst Engineer Cole there is little
Sinister threats have been made
against the life of Cole during the last
few months, and a number of attempts
have been made to wreck his train. One
of these attempts met with partial suc
cess, when about a month ago his train
was derailed at Kingsburg. Yardmaster
Crowley stated last night that the rail
road detectives have been trying to fix
,the blame /or the diabolical work, but
they have so far been . unsuccessful,
though there is a strong suspicion In cer
tain Quarters.
Hugh Butts, brother of the dead fire
man, stated last night that his brother
had spoken to him a number of times of
the attempts being made on the life of
Cole. "And." said Butts, "though my
brother thought a great deal of Cole, he
had made up his mind to ask to be
transferred to another run." S^z'Z.
The local police and Sheriffs deputies,
assisted by men in the employ of the
railroad are on the trail of the wrecker.
Beside the switch was found the lock,
which had evidently been broken by
either a reck or a hammer. Careful
measurements of fresh footprints found
V<eside the switch were taken* and the
footprints followed for some distance. A
few rods away the prints widened,
showing that the man had broken Into a
run.
Several among those who were wait
ing at the depot for the Owl, among
them* William Strong, "the mail transfer
man. declare that they saw the switch
light move about half a minute before
the wreck. The switch bar was raised
jusr enough to "cock" the switch, but
not sufficient to show the red danger
signal to the oncoming train.
The wrecking train from Bakersfield
did not arrive until 9:15 o'clock, and the
bodies of the engineer -nd fireman were
not recovered from the debris until 11:30.
Engineer Cole was found sitting upright
in his seat with his hand upon the throt
tle. He was still at his post. Before
death. came he had. shut off-thc steam
and thrown on the air brakes. A . bar

schooner Vanname and King of New

gale off the South Carolina coast on Oc

The two men who lived through the
five days. aad were rescued by the
schooner Stillman F. Kelly, which ar
rived here late to-day, are William
Thomas and William G. Warner, both
about 29 years old. six feet three inches
tall and.hail from Antigua. British West

cumbed, were: Captain William A. Max

At 6 .o'clock on the morning of October

schooner -was hpve . dowp on her beam

thÂ«k bulwarks. There they remained,

Saturday the schooner turned com
pletely over they managed to cut his
lashings and drag him to a piece. of
the after-house. It was several hours
i before -they were all huddled together
on their little raft. That night Arthur
died in the arras of Captain Maxwell,
and his body was dropped overboard.
Sunday brought a ray of hope when
a craft, was sighted, but the gloom set
in again as she passed^" by without
heeding the little group of, seamen who
frantically signaled her.
That night the waves subsided and a
little rain fell. This was eagerly
caught in a tarpaulin and gave some
relief It was only temporary, and not
long afterward Mate Chase's mind gave
way entirely and the craft was again

CALX. BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. Oct. 16.â Secretary Shaw
and the" Collector of the Port at Saa
Francisco have had a load of trouble for
several weeks about which the public
has known nothing, and It was lifted to
day. It was on account of the present 3
which Miss Alice Roosevelt, daughter of
the President, has received during her
trip to the Philippines, China. Japan and
Korea. As the President's daughter, she
has been given many pretty and some
valuable presents. One newspaper re
ported several weeks ago that the actual
value would be something like $100,000.
She has received silks in China and
Japan, pearls in the island of Sulu. and
wherever else she has gone gift 3 have
been showered upon . her.
Tht custom officials have been won
dering what they ought to do when M 133
Roosevelt arrives in an American port
with the riches of the mines and -looms
of the Orient. Some of them suggested
that, as she is the daughter of the Pres
ident, she ought to be allowed to bring
the valuables in duty free, inasmuch- aj
she was' treated with "'all "the' honors of
a Princess and did so much to cement
friendship between the United States and
foreign , countries! The belongings of
the crowned heads of royalty and "' of
diplomats are thus admitted duty free
into the United States.
Secretary Shaw received suggestions
until he was almost sick. All that stood
out before his official gaze- was that the
presents had to be reported as worth
possibly $100,000. and if the usual rate of
duty were imposed it would cost Miss
Roosevelt or her father upward of 60
per cent, or $60,000. Neither Miss Roose
velt nor her father is rich, although the
young lady is understood to have a mod
est fortune in her own right.
Finally Secretary Shaw took his trou
bles to the President and told him
about it. .:._:.^-.-
"There Is only one thing to do.", re
plied the President: "that is to treat my
daughter's baggage as you would tho
baggage of any other private person. She
will pay duty on everything that Is
dutiable."
Secretary Shaw v f eels better about it.
Members of the Taft party to the
Philippines say that the value of- Miss
Roosevelt's presents has been exag
gerated, but. whatever the value. It will
be determined by the local appraisers at
San Francisco.

ing: the conclusion of peace Is as fol
lows:
VTe have always deemed It a fundamental
rrinclpl- of our international policy to main
tain peace in the East and thus assure the se
cuiity of our empire, and the promption of thin
high object has. therefore been bur constant
eim; but last year, for reasons dictated by the
necessity of self-preservation, we, unfortunate
ly, were forced into hostilities with Russia.
Since the war began cur army and navy have
made adequate provision for home defence and
military preparations with the empire It6elf
and have withstood hardships of all kinds dur
ing their campaigns abroad, and thus have
achieved a glorious success. Our civil officials.
In concord with our Diet, have diligently per
formed their duties In furtherance of our will.
All measures for the prosecution of -the war
and for the administration of domestic affairs
have been properly taken, as thÂ« exigencies of
Oie situation demanded. Â»jur t>eople, frugal
,and prudent, have cheerfully borne the heavy
burdens of national experscitures and have con
tributed to the war fund, thus assisting, as
with one will. In advancing the prestige and
maintaining the dignity of the State.
The result is due in large measure to the be
nign spirits of our anceetors, as well as to the
devotion to duty of our civil and military offi
cials and the self-denying patriotism of all our
people.

ABSOLUTE
DIVORCE IS
ASKED FOR
Princess Louise Is
Defendant in
Civil Suit.
.Sequel to Her /Elope
ment With an Aus
trian Officer. '
Attempt Made to Effect an
Amicable Agreement for
- a Separation.
GOTHA, Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and
Gotha, Oct. 16.-*-The suit brought by
Prince Philipe /of Saxe-Coburg and
Gotha for an absolute divorce from his
wife, Princess Louise, and for an.ad
justment of their joint property in
terests, was begun here to-da.y. before
the ordinary count for the trial of di
vorce cases, the Prince having waived
his. technical right to have the case
tried by. a special court, as provided for
under the laws of his family.
Both of the principals were absent,
but the Austrian officer, Lieutenant
Keglevitch Mattasich, with whom the
Princess eloped, was present. The
president of the court inquired 'of at
torneys for the Prince If they deslreo
to make any motion respecting- . the
publicity of the proceedings. They re
plied that the Prince had no objection
to the proceedings being public. The
attorneys for the Princess also de
clined to request privacy.
The president then began the pro
ceedings by proposing to the lawyers
that the two parties seek to bring
about a reconciliation,^explaining that
this was not meant to* get the Prince
or Princess to live together again, but
to agree on an amicable separation and
a satisfactory agreement regarding
the. property. The lawyers agreed to
take the matter under consideration,
and asked for an intermission for this
purpose.
The Prince's lawyer said the Pnince
asktd for an absolute divorce. In order
to secure a complete Separation of the
couple. . . ,
During .the recess the lawyers agreed
to an arrangement on the following
basis: The Prince to guarantee the
payment to the Princess . of a yearly
allowance of {18,000 and also to pay
to- her a lump sum-' of $30,000, pro-
Vltffcd she aban"don Â£; 'atl ;) &f i her claims
against' the "Prince. 0 arid 'that after the
divorce she adopt the name and title
of Louise, Princess of Belgium. S-i
After these -terms were laid before
the court a recess was taken In' drder
that the Princess might be' telegraphed
to for her assent ,to the. agreement.
Later in (the day the lawyers for the
Princess "attacked the competence of
the court to decide the case at all.
The court then adjourned to October
30, in order to study the question of iis
competence, to get an answer from
Princess Louise and to' settle the ap
plicability- of the Austrian law to
Prince Philipe's, agreement that the
court avoid raising the question as to
which party is guilty. .
The /Prince's bill of complaint, beside
alleging the Princess' misconduct with
Lieutenant Keglevitch Mattasich, says
that althotigh the Princess received a
yearly allowance, she had contracted
debts which in 1895 amounted to
$744,812, of which the Prince has paid
$218,000, ami that in her wardrobe were
found seventy-flve pairs of silk shoes,
120 pairs pf other shoes. 60 parasols
and about 100 hats.
endeavor should be made to attain success In
peaceful pursuits, so that In equal measure
with Its power the prosperity of the country
may be maintained and Its permanent progress
insured. ; -
We strongly admonish our subjects agalnet
manifestations of vainglorious pride and com
mand them to attend to their, lawful avoca
tions and' to d'>- all that lies In their power to
etrengthen the empire. .

TAGGART CHILDREN 'WHOSE CUSs
TODY HAS GIVEX RISE TO A
PERPLEXING PROBI^M. -
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOOSTER, Ohio, Oct. 16. â The at
torneys for Major. Taggart were given
a surprise to-night when they learned
that Judge Smyser, the attorney for
Mrs. Taggart, had filed a motion for. a
new trial. It waa supposed that Judge
Smyser had only given the notice to
preserve his rights. . The . motion
moves that the Judgment and decree be
set aside. for the following reasons: -.. "
'v Firstâ Thar durinc the trial of the cue the
court trred In admitting evidence In ' favor of
the plaintiff and against the defendant. ' .
Second â That the court erred In the trial of
the case In the rejection of. evidence offered
by the â¢ defendant.' \u25a0\u25a0 â¢ â¢ \u0084.\u25a0_â¢. . -
â¢- Third â Because .of - the Irregularity â¢of the
plaintiff, by which the defendant was precluded
from having a fair and impartial hearing and
which irregularity consisted Of ; bringing to the
attention of the court and before the court out
side-matter not offered In evidence and not
brought to the attention of the court.
j Fourhâ Because the Judgment and- decree
were contrary to the evidence and wholly un
supported by the evidence.
Fifth â Because the Judgment and'decree were
clearly contrary and against- the evidence.
Sixth â Because the Judgment and decree
were given for the plaintiff when by law and
evidence they should have beÂ«n for the de
fendant/. 7' ,:'\u25a0 '.' "
It is stated that the attorneys for
Mrs. Taggart win claim that Judge
Eason conferred with outside parties
as to what and for whom the judgment
and decree should be. t
Although the decree of Judge Eason
places the Taggart children under the
guardianship of .. their father. Major
Taggart may, : find it difficult to get
Culver into his possession without ac
tually'going to Mrs. Taggart's house
and â¢'tearing; the boy away from his
mother. Mrs. Taggart will prepare Cul
ver to accompany his father, but â¢ to
force him to leave her is an act she Is
not equal to.- : Culver seems determined
to- resist. the major's authority..
". Major : Taggart's attorney, E. S.
â¢Wertz, said to-night ' if Taggart
chose to co-operate with MajoY- Tag
gart in managing the children she
eventually will have them almost en

DOAX'S PILLS.
"TGiAnÃoir"
How It Has Spread From Home to Home
in San Francisco. .
In every part of San Francisco, in
the homes of the wealthy, in the
humble abode of the man of toil, 'tis
now a well-known fact â a great
truth â that Doan's Kidney Pills have
brought more comfort to backache
sufferers and cured more sick kidneys
than any medicine of modern times.
1 John Lewis, tailor, rear of 721
Bush street, says: "An attack of
malaria, as in the majority of in-
stances, was followed by inactivity
of the kidneys and a lameness and
soreness across the small of the back.
Sitting, as I am compelled to do,
partially stooped, strained the mus-
cles of\the loins and aching ensued t
and whÂ«Â» I straightened I could only
describe the twinges which ,shot
through the small of my back as ex-
cruciating. With the passing of
time the pain increased, until I was
compelled to stop work. I knew
something had to be done or my
case might become serious, and I
commenced taking standard remedies
guaranteed to cure kidney complaint
in any of its various forms. The re-
salts obtained from the medicines
ceased the moment I stopped their
use, and, ever on the outlook for
something to bring relief, I at last
tried Doan's Kidney Pills. I knew
after a dose or two they were acting,
directly upon the kidneys, and a con-
tinuation of the treatment absolutely
stopped the last attaefc. I have told
a great many, of my friends and ac-
quaintances about the benefit I have
received from the use of Doan's Kid-
1 ney Pills." For sale by all dealers.

ANDREWS LEAVES
WOMAN'S PICTURE
IT MAY BE VALUABLE GLEWi
HEROINE OF A DENVER MYSTERY WHO IS BELIEVED TO BK THE WOMAN
WHO POSED AS THE WIFE OF MILTON ANDREWS AND WHO WAS PRES
ENT WHEN ELLIS WAS MURDEROUSLY ASSAULTED. â¢
BERKELEY. Oct. 16.â Grasping at every
clew which might possibly lead to the
identification of Milton Andrews' female
companion, the Berkeley police to-night
made use of a woman's picture found
among Andrews' effects when he fled
from Berkeley, and secured partial iden
tification of the picture as that of "Mrs.
Milton Andrews."
The picture is a newspaper portrait,
printed in Denver newswapers Oc
tober 2, ISO 4, and was believed by that ;
paper, when printed, to be a picture of
Miss Julia Ward. The police ofâ Den- ;
v>er found a woman's trunk, rifled and
thrown into an alley, and could not lo
cate the owner, or find trace of any per
son who knew whence It came, or who
had despoiled It.
A murder mystery was scented by the
police, and- the Denver newspapers pub
lished a description of the articles found
In the trunk, and printed a picture of
Miss Julia Ward, to whom a number or
lexers in the trunk had been addressed.
According to Andrews' admissions to
Ellis, the former was In Denver at the
time of this trunk mystery. Andrews
preserved the newspaper clippings relat
ing to the trunk mystery, which never
was solved. These clippings were found
here In his trunk.
Now the police have decided to ascer
tain whether the "Julia Ward" whose
picture the papers printed In Denver, is
not the woman companion of Andrews at
this time. The picture was shown to
William Ellis, at the Roosevelt Hospital
to-night, and he partially Identified it as
that of "Mrs. Milton Andrews."
"When I put my hand over the' bottom
part of the picture," said Ellis, "it seems
to resemble the Andrews . woman. I
could not be sure that it Is a picture of
her, however."
S. B. Kenfield, the real estate agent of
Berkeley, who rented the house where
Andrews lived to the trio made up of
Andrews, his wife and Ellis, was shown
the picture to-night. He said the lower
part of the picture resembled the woman
who accompanied Andrews and Ellis, but
he could not be so sure about the upper
P The discussion regarding Ellis' actual
identity was referred to by Marshal Voll
mer to-day, who made the following state
ment: "* A -:
There is absolutely no doubt in , my mind
after repeated interviews with William Ells
at the Roosevelt Hospital, that- he realljr Is
William Ellis. 1 an Australian bookmaker well
known in his own country. To corroborate the
statement that he is none other than Ellis
there is a preat quantity of proof. ~-
He could not, for example, have been, a*
stated a member of the gang which met- Of
ficer Lestrange In West Berkeley when LÂ«
strange killed one of the crowd because that
killing occurred on September 28. and at that
moment Ellis was on the high sJas " en route
to America -from Australia, Ellis in
Australia was Ellis and not Lee. The latter
was a name he assumed while aboard the
steamer. We know that from abundance <k
testimony. He was known . in Australia as
Ellis by Frank Hardy, the quartermaster of
the Sonoma- he was known as Ellis in. Aus
tralia by Barney Bernard, and the Australian i
newspaper clipping we have, describing his
leaving Australia, refers to him as Ellis. He
was prominent enough In racing circles there,
hJs appellation being â¢'Friday" Ellis. He had
lived there all his life, bad- a record as a
Jockey, turfman and bookmaker and could not;
possibly have been "Lee. an Australian crook."'
He fcas offered me money to cable to Aus
tralia and learn exactly who he Is, giving his
address to me ln*Sydney, and the names of
Sydney people that are well known and re
putable according to those who know Sydney.'
1 am convinced after a week's work on the
case that he was a dupe of Andrews, and that
while lie may have been not altogether straight
in his racing business, he was Just about what,
the average racir.g man is supposed to be, and
his object In coming to America was to -work
with Andrews in the carrying out of racing
deals tbat probably would have been crooked,
but that are usually regarded as commonplace.

of Andrews . or v Ãrush or Curtis or, what
ever else his name may be, in Berkeley.
iHE^ SAN FRANCISCO .CALL, -TUESDAYSp^TO^ER^I7,i^I9OS;:
The strongest point In connecting Miss
Ward with Andrews are several . letters
found in the discarded trunk. Telegrams
from the Berkeley police declare that the
woman who assisted Andrews in slug
ging Ellis is a French-Canadian. Sev
eral letters found, in the woman's trunk
by the detectives indicate that she is
from Canada. One letter showed that
her father is John Ward of Boston, On
tario, and others that the woman has
a sister in an orphanage in her home
city. At the time the letters were found
the detectives searched diligently for. Miss
Ward, it being feared she might have
been the victim of foul play. Numerous
letters were found from Fort Logan, but
she was unknown at the military post.
Another letter which led the detectives
to believe Miss Ward might have lived
at 1525. Pennsylvania avenue disclosed
that no such person ever lived there.
Another letter showed that the writer
was in frequent correspondence with a
Peter Brown, a printer employed by the
New York Herald.. Local detectives be
lieve the finding of the woman will solve
the Mount Cutler mystery and are mak
ing every effort to trace her movements.
Andrew*' Double Arrested.
BOISE, Idaho, Oct IG.-t-A. Burch, the
well-known Spokane mining man, for
merly manager of the Bunker Hill
mine, arrived here last evening after a
somewhat remarkable chain of experi
ences on the way from San Francisco
to this place. Several attempts were
made to arYest him on the' supposition
that he was the man who at Berkeley
recently committed a murderous as
sault upon an Australian horseman and
robbed him of $5000. The trouble was
occasioned by a clerk in. the ticket of
fice at San Francisco who reported he
had sold a ticket from San Francisco to
Boise to a man answering the descrip
tion of Andrews. On this information
the officers instructed officers at vari
ous points' along the road to arrest the
passenger. He was called out of his
stateroom at Roseburg, but soon snow
ed the officers that the description did
not flt him, excepting that v he wore a
Vandyke beard. As the train neared
Portland jhe was again called out. This
time it was Sheriff "Ward of Multno

% NEW YORK. Oct. .16.â The following
is the Republican estimate of the vote
in Greater New York: >
Kst limited total vote. ......... . .555,000
Ivlna f . ..'.'. ..... ... â¢ . ...*....... .220,000

"I have received word from. a promi
nent Tammany man," Mr.'lvins said to
night, "that if Mr. .Hearst polls. IUO.OOO
votes I shall; win."
There is; much uncertainty, as to the
size of the Hearst vote, /although all
political managers -agree .that: it will
be large. Tammany believes -that
Hearst will draw thirty Republican
votes for each seventy. Democratic
votes .that he may poll.' \ The Repub
licans believe that the proportion will
j be ; eighty-five Democratic to fifteen Re
publican in each 100. . ;.
; That the Democratic city campaign is
to be made against the candidacy of
Hearst rather than against the Republican
city and county candidates . was evident
to-day from the manner jin which the
candidate of the Municipal Ownership
League was assailed. Published charges
against Mr. Hearst were circulated in
Tammany Hall before the arrival of
Charles F. Murphy, and the district lead
ers discussed them with evident satis
faction.
The most conspicuous, of ; the alleged
shortcomings of Mr. Hearst were those to
the effect i that one - of- his newspapers
had been in the pay of a big railroad
corporation while it professed to be a
friend of labor.
Another of the charges was that Mr.
Hearst has not yet given any accounting
of tho money collected for s the purpose
of erecting a monument to the men" who
were killed on the United States â¢ battle
ship Maine early in. 1898. -
Under the caption "Hearst, Where is the
Maine Monument Fund?" it is alleged
that Mr. Hearst is guilty of a breach of
trust to the American people." It is said
that while Mr^Hearst and his newspapers
asknowledge the receipt â¢of from J125.00U
to 5200,000, no move has yet been made
to erect the monument and no explana
tion of the whereabouts of the fund has
been given to the school children, widows
and the poor or the rich, who
contributed to the fund.
It is alleged that Richard Croker at the
sollciation of Mr. Hearst subscribed ?1000
and Mayor Van Wyck, at Mr. Hearst's
request, presided at a notable meeting
held for the purpose" of swelling the size
of the fund.
Mr. Murphy declined to talk about the
attack on Mr. Hearst. He said, however,
that the /Tammany organization would
not protest, so far as he knew, against
the further admittance of Mr. Hearst to
Democratic Congressional caucuses. ,
ADMIMSTEKS WHISKY
BEFORE OPERATIONS
Physician^Finds It lessei#
Patients' Fear of '
Anesthetics.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW, YORK, Oct. 16. â Anesthetics
with a highball accompaniment is the
latest triumph of medical science. No
need hereafter to worry about suffoca
tion by the fumes of ether or chloroform
when about to undergo an operation. All
the delights of a gentle "jag" are prom
ised while sliding into /orgetfulness.
Dr. James Gwathmey, a . Manhattan
practitioner, has, after -years of experi
menting,' found an ideal way* to combine
the narcotic force of the anesthetic with
the influence of the highball. If one hap
pens to have scruples against highballs
the flavor of the anesthetic may be
given with cologne trimmings./ It is all
the same to the doctor.
Medical men have admitted for years
that the great drawback to the adminis
tration of ether and chloroform has been
the dread of patients that they might die
under the influence. This fear, they say,
has been the primary cause of seven out
of ten deaths that have occurred on oper
ating tables. The mortality as a direct
result of the anesthetic itself, they in
sist, is comparatively small.
By giving a few whiffs of cologne, or
whisky, according to the" appetite of the
patient, he loses the dread of chloroform
or ether; he thinks that , the anesthetic
wllKnotbe so bad after all.' He is told
he may ' have { all . the . booze or perfume
he wants. - He takes good, 'long breaths
and finds It is pleasing and his mind in
the meanwhile becomes subdued. Resist
ance Is 'reduced' to a ; minimum. ; .. '~ â¢ .
When- the doctor sees the'patient is In
a 'receptive condition of mindlhe grad
ually turns lon the anesthetic -and soon
the surgeons can -begin .work.

claim, is . granted them by the treaty

men and the reasons therefor. Secre
tary Root will not make further rep
resentations to the London Govern
ment. Gardner has telegraphed to
Gloucester to obtain additional lnfor 1
mation.

ing it was reported that the New

sels to fish on the treaty coast where
they were then located. \u25a0 * â¢

VALLEJO, . Oct. 16.â 1t was thought'
that to-day's, the fifteenth, session of
the court-martial of .Commander Lu
cien Young, of the Benningrton, ; would
end", the case of the prosecution,, :} or
that -at least Lieutenant Commander
Bartlett would have concluded his; tes
itimony and Ensign Wade called, but
Bartlett finished his sixth -day on the
witness stand this afternoon 1 and will
continue to-morrow. Bartlett has an
swered more than 1000 questions, prin
cipally propounded by Naval Construc
tor Evans for the defense, /and he has
yet .to be caught in a 1a 1 blunder. This
morning he \u25a0 openly refused to answer
technical questions put to him, by
Evans -and answered tlien^ only, after
being instructed to do so by the court.
In - the afternoon Bartlett. had to be
warned several- times , that â¢ tue \u25a0 court,
nnd not he, would decide" whether the
questions- put by Evans were material.
At . the opening of the session] ; this
morning Evans asked the witness if
mild .: steel. - heated red hot and* then
cooled off with cold water, -dons a blue
color. JBartlejtt did not give the court
time to rule on the question, but stated
that it had nothing to do with- the caise
and refused to answer it. 'â¢ Evans ' ap
pealed to the court, and afjter a short
deliberation Bartlett was jordered to
answer all direct questions^ The court
was in session only forty minutes in
the. morning, as Bartlett wished . to
verify his -testimony given duringr the
pryvjous five days. Later during the
afternoon 'Bartlett was shown several
parts taken from the ship's boilers and
asked" for an opinion.. As they were
submitted,by the defense and Bartlett
is a wltriess for;;'the ( prpsecuitio'n, tho
witness stated that he would not ex
amine them ordered' to do, so.
The court warned Bartlett that he was
not the judge of : the question, that
this function rested \u25a0 solely . with the
court and that if he continued to act
as he had been, doing that the court
would mete ou/t such punishment as
the naval regulations require.
This incident occurred - late in the
afternoon, but it settled the course of
the examination, - for the court ruled
that, no further -expert testlmpny
should be taken from the witness, as
it was apparent that any further state
ments from him would be unessential.
Judge Gear, as the counsel .for the
defen?o. took a final -.fling, at;Bar,tlett,
questioning' him on his duties : as tlie
engineering officer ot the Pacific
squadron.
â¢Uurtlett ntntetl tlint he had mndr Â«n

The court itself objected to this
statement and- Gear asked that it be
withdrawn. The Judge Advocate ob
jected strongly to the. statement being
withdrawn and; soon the counsel for
the prosecution and the defense and
the court mingled their objections and
demands in hot dispute. West finally
apologized and the matter ended with
the court disallowing the question.
It is likely that Young and Comman
der Ransome will be placed on the
stand to-morrow.

he could fire- again Bishop. was grabbed
by bystanders, who immediately placed
him under arrest. The trouble was due
to ill feeling that has existed between
the men for some time.

m OR. TALGOTT co.FUSION CANDIDATES ARE MAKING A WINNING CAMPAIGN
PARTRIDGE PACKS HALLS
IN TWO BIG DISTRICTS
Crowds Warmly Greet Nomiaee
Who Stands for Decency.
Candidate Saj^s Grafters Are
Already on the Defensive.
Two rousing meetings greeted John
6. Partridge In the Thirty-fourth and
Thirty-seventh districts last night and
the fusion speakers from John S. Part
ridge to the determined for
District Attorney. Henry U. Branden
ateiri, were applauded from start to
finish and the principles of decency,
civic honor and clean politics were
p.heered to the echo.
Mr. Partridge's first speech was
made last night in Phelps Hall at 319
Devisadero street in the Thirty-seventh
district, and the rather small hall was
crowded from the doorways, where the
Jam was impassable, down ito the stair
ways to the street. After the meeting
many were heard regretting their mis
fortune in not being able to see or
catch a glimpse of the fusion standard
bearer.
Prom the time of Mr. Partridge's en
trance ur/i! he was pulled and hustled
through the crowds blocking the en
trances every reference made to the
candidate for Mayor and every strong
utterance made by him was Indorsed
by hand, foot and voice of his auditors.
The speech by Mr. Partridge was most
appropriate to the occasion and is as
follows:
I propose to talk to-night about the law â not
the law In the abstract, but the effect of not
enforcing it end not obeying it. Anarchy re
sults as surely when there is no respect for
law as when there Is no law. And that Is the
condition in San Francisco to-day.
I don't mean that none of the laws are en
forced and obeyed â but 6u:nc of them are not.
And the man who breaks one law wantÂ« only
opportunity to shatter the whole code, though
the dearest rights of the people are involved.
Nov.- let us examine the ease of th< Police
Department. The police are the guardians oi
life and property, end when they are demoral
ized or subject lo any evil influence life and
property are not and ca::aot bo *afe. Does
*ny on 6 doubt that the Police Department of
l-aa Francisco is subject to an evil influence?
Kfhe does, let me tell you what I saw with
rr.y own eyee. When the itepublican Conven
von met last month there was a stronp mi-
absolutely under the control of one
an. That minority was opposed to every ao-
T:on of the convention ana voiced its protest.
as It had an undoubted right to do. But that
was not aM. Th<j police, acting under the di
rection of Iwo of the Commissioners, filled the
jrallery with the worst jrartK I have ever seen.
Those same two Ccmmit:siorÂ»crs personally mc
c :ted this crowd to disorder and riot. They led
the uproar in a vain endea'.or to break up the
*vrnvention. They incited the mob to interrupt
the speakers *>nd drown wnat they had to say.
In epite of the fact that many ladles were
present the air was filled with curses and
cries so obscene that hardened men, even of
their own faction, were disgusted and dis
mayed. One of the Commissioners was fore
most in the crowd which rushed upon the stage
arid made a. violent assault upon our sergeant
Â« i -arms. .
LAWS ARE VIOLATED.
Such actions are not only violative of the
formal law. but they are contrary to every
principle of human liberty. They sre vioia
t}vÂ«> of Â«ht Federal ' and State constitutions,
which insure to all of us the right of free
speech and th* right. of peaceable assemblage.
They arc violatlvt of the great American prin- j
ciple of tair play. Â°f the corwiaation of the
majority and the rule of popular representa
tion. And they are violative of the direct
provisions of the charter, wtilch declare that no
member of the Board o: Police Commissioner*?
thall take i art in political affaire. .
The police force is absolutely demoralized.
CÂ«.iod me-a in the dcpurtmtni have told me
that thines have corae to such a pa?s that
they are ordered around by gangs oT toughs
?nd hoodlums arÂ»l that they a<e afraid to
n?ak<! an arrest because any rowdy can curry
favor wit lithe administration and make trouble
iavor with the administration and make trouble
JCcv.'. there is no wiser provision of th;
(\u25a0barter than that which prohibits the use of
the po-'w 'or political puntoses. and no one
arpreoifat** that more than the patrolmen
tbelÃMives. If I am elected I propose to Â«â¢?

The meeting was called to order by
c B Perkins several minuttes before
the time set, owing to the Impatience
of the crowd to listen to the speech
making. Mr. Perkins introduced Ben
jamin Sloss as the first speaker. Mr.
Sloss is a prominent business man liv
ing in the district.
The speaker opened by referring to
the actlou of the Republicans and
Democrats in joining issues in the in
terest of Ban Francisco's betterment
â¢<ud gave the reasons for the commend
able sinking of personal issues of the
campaign until after the election has
pledged the city to common honesty or
common graft. â¢
If*, told of the impression Eastern
People had that this city is the abode
of graft and that the people are get
(in" what they deserve, as conditions
iiroÂ°the result of civic negligence. He
closed by telling of the many men who
am wearing the red button, but do not
Â«ntend to vote the red button, referring
particularly to the street car conduc
tO C S ' A. Sweisert, who is w6ll known
throughout the city-and is a fusion
nominee for the office of Supervisor,
thpn told the Â«ame torrid truths about
the/administration. He referred to_ fu
sion as the outcome of something
higher than partyism, and Bald the ,
administration seemed to have
fhe" grafting blood of twenty centuries
SXln iW veins. He added that the
drcision of every court before which
the Schmltz Commissioners had been
brought had rendered judgments for
the people as^inst the political Ilber-
tines, and he closed with a fine tribute
to the sterling qualities of John S. Par
tridge.
After Mr. Partridge had, spoken and
left for the meeting in the Thirty
fourth .Henry U. Brandenstein entered,
together with several other fusion can
didates, and ail were warmly greeted.
Air. Brandenstein gave the audience
many of the well-known stories of cor
ruption and graft that have been often
told in the corridors of the City Hall,
and promised that when he was elected
he would see that no man deserving of
punishment would escape the law and
any innocent man on strength of evi
dence would have every protection in
his power.
The other speakers were Daniel A;
Ryan, H. G. Davis. H. E. Lcland, John
Connor, Judge A. J. Fritz and Jesse W.
Bryan.
THIRTY-FOURTH TUBAS OUT.
Twln Peak* Hall IÂ» Packed by Men
Eaa-er to Hear CumlldateÃ.
The voters of the Thirty-fourth Dis
trict who turned out last night to tthe
big Partridge rally at Twin Peaks Hall
at Seventeenth and Xoc streets came
early and stayed late. Long before the
time set for the meeting the bonfire
was lighted, the band began to play
and those who were drawn by curiosity
were soon augmented by those desir
ing to hear the fusion nominees.
When the meeting was called to or
der E. M. Ritter was asked to preside,
which he did. and introduced the first
speaker, candidate for Supervisor, Jo
seph F. Nyland. Nyland's speech was
brief but to Ihe point and his promise
to support the new Mayor was received
with approval.
Fred Eggers, the popular candidate
for Tax Collector, was the next speak
er, and he was followed by the only
John J. Grelf, candidate for re-election
as County Clerk. Another popular and
well-received speaker was Henry U.
Brandenstein, who gave the audience
a few facts regarding the wirepulling
in the securing of political jobs under
the present administration. John A.
McGee, candidate for Supervisor, gave
some interesting accounts of the atti
tude of Mayor Schmitz toward labor in
the turning down of labor's represent
atives to make way for personal
friends of Abraham Ruef.
McGee told of the upholding of Po
lice Commissioner Drinkhouse despite
the appeals of the Cioarmakers' Union,
which had discredited the official and
his acts. Another Commissioner whose
appointment was secured by the City
Front Federation was forced out of of
fice because he opposed the- methods of
grafting on tlie French restaurants
and in addition stowd in the way of the
appointment of Dr. Poheim, Ruef's par
ticular ally. . '.-.
McGee was followed by John S. Part
ridge, who made his entry into the hall
and ascended the platform amid cheers
and applause. He spoke as follows:
Our enemies arc making this a. campaign of
falsehood and intimidation. It is an old trick
of. a. rasca! to cndeavjsr to escape the conse
quences of his own crimes, by charging others
with evil deeds. There has never been a man
ytt who atu-rupted J.Â° improve conditions â¢ whJ
was nut viiiiied an<f malizncci, and whose per
nsal chaiacier was not attacked. But I think
the pecple of San Francisco are fully aroused
to these tajtics, attj will not permit them
selves lo be let aside: from .their stern purpose
by the lies of the administration's hirelings.
The iriendÂ« of my . opponents are circulating
tw" little :alsehoods throughout the school de
pai'mtm. and \u25a0 I take this public opportunity
to t-ay they are not true. One is. that if I am
elected. I will appoint a particular person to
the fcVhool Board. I have no intention of doing
any such thing. The other is that I will re
move ail the probationary teachers appointed
by the present board. That, also is a lie, made
out of whole cicth. .1 tully approve of the
methc.J of appointing tcachets by competitive
examination. 1 have been a teacher in the
schools of Han Francisco myself, and I intend
to pursue the same policy in regard to the
teachers as to the members of â¢ other depart
ments â toleave th*m alone, no matter who ap
pointed them, so long as' they are decent, and
attend to tbelr business. I,fs the grafters I'm
after, and not those who are doing their, duty.
The southern end of this district particular
ly has -suffered from this administration. You
all remember the harm that was done to prop
erty, by the rwk crushing plant at Twenty
sixth street, and you remember -how, as. a
result of yiur agitation, you had. an ordinance
passed prohibiting Its maintenance, any longer.
You remtrebfr also that after, you had com
|>elled the abatement of this nuisance. It was
moved four' blocks away and set up again."- You
filed. a petition with the Board of Supervisors,
in which you act forth that the operation of a
roik crushing' and blasting plant was a menace
to life and a Serious detriment to a very
populous- section ot the .Mission, and you re
member How you ~ proved to ihe boanl that
such a plant would .depreciate property values
at least 2ft ;>ri- eÂ«-nt. .
SOME THINGS TO RECALL.
You rejnember also that the' authorities of
Mary's Help Hospital,' a. purely" charitable In
ttitutlcii, .represented to ihe board that their
property also would bo Injured, by the estab
lishment of a rock cniher *ud quarry. The
Board of Supervisors agreed with you, and
passed an ordinance extending the limits with
in which rock crushers could be malntaiftrtf
and pont that ordinance to the. Mayor tor his
signature. You will remember now, and I
J>elievÂ» you will remember on -election day,
that the .Mayor vetoed that ordinance in spite
of y>ur pleadings and in spite of the unan-
EwÂ«-rable arguments and unimpeachable â¢ eyl
df-me you had presented. - The matter â went
again to the- committee- and -they reported as
follow;,: . :
"Your committee cannot avoid' expressing
their astonishment at thÂ«Â» tone of tender regard
for Gray Brothers pervading the Mayor's mes
sage. They are not aware of- anything in* the
past history. of this firm meriting Â«?uch treat
ment. The sympathetic fear, expressed that
they might ; incur losses U ..their proposed
quarry wrre rupprccscd docs. not seem Justified
by tlie circumstances. It_lÂ« not . true) as the
message ftates.. 'that on the faith of the newly,
established limits,' they, began the construction
of. their works.. They knew perfectly well for
what reason the former ordinances were parsed,
which fixed the present limits, und they also
knew fully as well that thr same, condition
which made them obnoxious, at :.TVccty-rixth
street exiÂ«itÂ«d -in an increased- measure at
Thirtieth street. If they ; hare made 'any ex
pcndliurre they have done co with their eyes
fully opemd and well aware of a probability
of having the ordinances amended bo as to In- |
elude the present site. It Is puerile to *ay i
that they believed they would not b* mol^Ud
because they were outside the bounds fixed by :
the former ordinance?. .Iris not because thl* i
boai-d has p>*?Â«tl Â«n ordinance that qunrrlen '
and rock crushers are objectionable, but- they'
are objectionable because those who desire to'i
operate them select a*'-Â«lteÂ« residence districts:
In which no JU5t or honorable man would ever
think of locating a quarry." -,_: - ... .'

CHAIRMAN MAKES
WILD STATEMENT
."The laws were made by the rich to
oppress the poor. The rich have for
years put in their guardians of these
laws. Wait until the Union Labor party
gets into power." These were the
words with which President Richard
Cornelius of the Carmen's Union intror
duced one of the nominees of the Union
Labor party at Bear Hall, Fortieth Dis
trict, last night, and his sentimet.ts
were wildly cheered by some of the
great crowd which ' had gathered â¢ to
hear Mayor Schmitz. What the'ehair
man meant by these words very few
know, but their apparent absence of
truth will undoubtedly swing many
doubtful voters, over into the ranks of
the fuslonists. Disapproval was every
where expressed. It Is the many wild
expressions of .this kind made by some
of tho speakers at the Schmltz meet
ings that are causing the thinking
population of San Francisco, the, part
of the people upon . .whose â votes the
outcome of this election rests,' to doubt
the responsibility of the candidates who
claim to be the only rear representa
tives of union labor.
Bear Hall was packed to hear Mayor
Schmitz and on his appearance the
cheering became voluminous. Scottish
Hall, the sec.ond 'meeting place, was not
packed and only part of the audience
was enthusiastic. ;<-i:
Mayor Schmitz Is beginning the third
week . with great . earnestness. He is
speaking for a much "longer time each
evening than has' been, his; custom and
he is dealing directly, with the political
issues of this" municipal .;â¢ campaign.
Everywhere he is greeted by crowds of
cheering adherents, and he stated last
night that he/felt confident. of pulling
out ahead of the fuslbnists. He Is try
ing to force the issue; of the- Citizens'
Alliance against the wage-earners and
declares \u25a0.emphatically that, the election
of Partridge willmeanthe lengthening
of the hours of labor and :the lessening
of wages. ; ; . - \u25a0 â¢ ' -' \u25a0'\u25a0

RUEF DEFENDS
AND ATTACKS
For four hours last night A. Ruef held
the stage alone at the Alhambra Theater
and before a large' audience defended
himself and Mayor. Schmitz's administra
tion from charges of graft. Ruef ran
the gamut of accusations that have been
lodged , against the Mayor and he took
special pains to couple his own name
| with 'Â»that. of the chief executive in his
i seriatim and categorical denials of state
! mc-nts of wrongdoing in the official life
of the city. ' . .
I Ruef declared that he and the Mayor
1 were victims of false accusations, be
â¢ cause they would not be intimidated or
bulldozed. He 'declared that the cry of
graft had- been raised to veil what he
Insisted was the real issue 'of the cam
! paign. This, the speaker Insisted, wa? a
battle between selfish capital arid the
laboring man, be he union or non-union.
For a climax to his lengthy speech
Ruef charged that John S. Partridge, the
1 fusion . nominee v for. Mayor, was ineligible
to take his seat in the event of election,
on the grojund- that Partridge had not
p been a resident of San Francisco for the
I five years preceding the election, as re-
I quired by the charter. To support his
contention^ Ruef read from the city di
rectory of .Berkeley, for 1905. and quoted
Partridge's residence as being at 2611
| Haste street |in th^ jcollege city. Ruef
claimed; to 'have a*g|^Rdavit showing^ihat
i Partridge had lost' 'residence in May "of
last year, and had not regained it until
March last. V, ' â¢* '
' rAt .the outset 'Ruef announced that
this was the; first' time in. the 'history
of, San." Francisco * that a man called a
political boss had the hardihood to ad
dress an audience in a political cam
paign. He insisted there was no graft
in the administration, and he chal
lenged a' microscopical examination of
his acts or those of Mayor Schmltz to
uncover an,y. ;\u25a0' 'V " "
"The isrnie," said Ruef. "is the issue
of the sack against the man; avari-'
clous, greedy capital under the garb of
the Citizens' Alliance against the labor
ing man. The man who' is collecting:
the campaign . funds for the fusion
ticket is Louis Sloss, treasurer of the
Citizens' Alliance. This. fusion move
ment is headed by a crowd of profes
sional politicians and professional of
fice-holders. On their side it is a cam
.paign of deceit and hypocrisy."
Ruef announced it was no wonder
Partridge banners had been torn down
by true American citizens who are sup
porters of Schmitz. He said these acts
were caused by the indignation of hon
est workingmen south of Market street.
But' Ruef .pleaded with his hearers not
to, interfere with the signs.
Ruef said .lie listened with- horror and
abhorrence to the cry of graft when he
looked over the listof men who were be
hind Partridge. The speaker said Part
ridge-would he a general without an army
if, he let out all of the "grafters" who
were In his camp.
â¢ As for himself Ruef vehemently as
serted-he. had never taken a dishonest or
an immoral dollar in his life. He ad
mittedhe was attorney for the California
Liquor Dealers' Association, but his fee
was only $500 a year, he said.â He had
never taken a dollar for his political in
fluence, pull, favor, or for place-getting.
He.called upon the wholesale liquor deal
ers, to declare that there had been no un
fair, discrimination In the handling of the
saloon .business. .- .
â¢Ruef declared the Schmitz Central l Club
had;.coBt -him JICO a month to meet ar
rears in -the running expenses. He de
nounced the last Grand Jury, report. as a
merely, political document in its attack
on the ': Mayor. He intimated he could
show- where Supervisors - who received
$1200 a year salary were spending $10,000
a >year. ,\u25a0 - -. . .'. - : â¢ .
Ruef said John S. Partridge was a
hypocrite' and charged him with being a
tool' of the. water, company, the , Citizens'
Alliance;andthe:Republican league. He
concluded by reciting charges of Part
ridge's \u25a0incllglbUity.^^^^^^. ,".-"\u25a0:

RECORDS IS ARGUED.
GANG OPPOSES SCRUTINY
Attorney Dam Deielares Steps Must Be
Taken to insure Honest Count.
Before Judge Sloss yesterday were
heard, the arguments on the demurrer
to the petition of Perry Newberry
for a writ of mandate compelling the
Election Commissioners to submit for
inspection the list of applicants for po
sitions, as officers at the coming city
election. Attorney F. H. Dam repre
sented the petitioner. James A. Devoto.
a member of the commission, appeared
in propria persona and also repre
sented his fellow members. The peti
tion alleges that a majority of the ap
plicants are not legally qualified to act
as election officers, the contention being
that the commission, In the interest of
Schrnitz and Ruef. is trying to pack
the booths with men who will use
their efforts in behalf of the present ad
ministration, and that the board will
not announce the appointments till one
week before the election, leaving no
time for objections to be passed upon.
- Attorney Dam opened the argument
on behalf of the petitioner. He ad
vanced on the broad lines that there is
no divinity that hedges about an Elec
tion Commissioner, permitting him to
perform any of the functions of his of
fice in a secret manner. No instrument
or document prepared in the ordinary
conduct of business, said the' attorney,
could be withheld from the inspection
of the public; for under the law all
official documents are public documents
and should be open to inspection at all
times.* There were cases, counsel ad
mitted, in which it had been 'held that
for reasons of public policy certain in
struments might be withheld until their
operation was complete, but in this case
no such contention would lie.
AXXIET,V FOR SECRECY.
It Is set forth in the petition that. a
citizen, who is both a taxpayer and an
elector, has demanded the right to in
spect a certain public document; a
document affecting the ballot and hence
one of the most important that could
be conceived. No good reason, he said,
could be advanced In support of the
position taken by the Election Com
mission, and its very anxiety to keep
the document secret until it was too
late to move in law against it went far
to demonstrate the truth of the asser
tion of the plaintiff that men to guard
the election against fraud were not
safely selected.
At this point in the argument Attor
ney A. S. Newburgh announced to the
court that he had come to represent
eleven of the men on the list of 600
Jlr. Newberry wished stricken from the
Groat Register. Though this case was
not on hearing. Judge Sloss ordered
that Newburgh be entered on the rec
ord as . associate." counsel. Xewburgh
then asked that' his clients be made de
fendants In the action. There being no
objection. Judge Sloss so ordered. New
burgh accepted service for all of his
clients and will appear this afternoon
tci aid fDevoto In preventing, jf possible,
ttio* effort *of" the plaintiff to purge the
register of the hundreds of names that
are illegally there. The morning ses
sion of the court was taken up with
this r:art of- Mr. Dam's argument.
COURT ASKS QUESTIONS.
"At the" afternoon" session of court
Attorney Dam "resumed his argument.
TATTERED BANNERS
AS OBJECT LESSONS
Analysis of Registration by Assembly
Districts Favorable to Fusion.
The first analysis of the large regis
tration is very favorable to Partridge.
The total number of names on the Regis
ter is .97,792. The number of registered
voters -in- the nine. Assembly districts
which . were wen - by - the Republican
League in the primary election is 51,393.
The ;number 'irr the nine districts which
were carried the grafters is 46,393.
These figures* show that the districts car
ried by the league have 50*30 more votes
than those carried by Ruef.

The Fusion Campaign Committee. D.

He said that the contention taojt tha
petitioner did not represent tha mass
of the people was erroneous and that
the case was one where the law gave
full right to Inspection on behalf of
the public The petitioner was satis
fying the severest requirement of the
common law rule In his demand for an
inspection of the list of applicants for
positions as election officers. There
was no doubt of the public interest -In
the matter, he said.
"I am inclined to think." Interrupted
Judge Sloss. "that there Is no doubt
of the public interest. Take the case
of a contested election as analogous.
Any citizen may contest upon maklns
certain affidavit. That seems to recog
nize'as public policy -the Interest of tha
elector. The argument In regard to
this point may rest at that. The ques
tion now is, is this list a public docu
ment to the extern that any citizen
may lnspeqt it, or is it merely such a
document as would furnish evidence In
an action at law?" ..'v --
Dam stuck to his contention that tha
list was a document of a public na
ture that should be open to inspection
for the benefit of the public.
The court again asked if the lists
might not merely be subject to use
in evidence and referred to the matter
of a Sheriff's attachment. Dam replied
that in an attachment proceeding there
was need of secrecy, as the interests
of parties to an action might be jeop
ardized by public inspection. The af
fidavits made by the persons who had
applied to be appointed election officers
had been sworn to and filed, ha said,
and were public documents.
"Do we have to appoint them?" de
manded Devoto.
SAYS PUBLIC IS BARRED.
"We contend that you intend to and
we will offer evidence to that effeot,"
replied Dam.
Devoto's argument In reply to Dam
was very brief. He Quoted but one
case â that of TVheelan against the Su
perior Court of the city and county of
San Francisco. He said that if the
court granjted the petition it would in
terfere with the duties of the Election
Commission. The board was using the
applications every day, he said, and
Mr. Newberry might send from four
to six people a day to look at them.
His construction of the law was that
the board must publish the list of
those chosen five days previous to one
week before the election.
"Have you the power to make
changes after the list is announced?"
asked the court.
"AYe certainly have," said Devoto.
"Under the law there will be twelve
days . in which to make protests and
changes, plenty of time for all who
have objections."
"Under the law." continued Devoto,
"the public may inspect those docu
ments that Interest the whole public.
I submit. that the public has no inter
est in the fact that a citizen has filed
an application to be appointed an elec
tion officer."
i "We have a right to see whether all
these affidavits are true," persisted
Dam. ( '

New Telephone Company
Wins Its Figilit Before the
City Council. After Hard
Battle, by a Single Vote
TWO HEMBEBS FLOT
OTEJfIE TO 3IOXOPOLY
Fitzgerald and McAdam
Grow Weak at Ringside,
but -Thiirstott's Final Blow
Knocks Out Old Concern
OAKLAND, Oct. lo.â By a vote of six
to five to-night the City Council finally
passed the ordinance granting permission
to the Home Telephone Company of Ala
tneda County to bid for a franchise to
compete with the Pacific States Com
pany. Two weeks- ago the ordinance was
passed to print by a vote of 8 to 3. To
night Fitzgerald and McAuam voted
against the competing- system.
The vote of Fitzgerald was the surprise
of the evening, as he was supposed to
favor the new company.
Whf n the matter was brought up to
night Baccus paid that the majority of
the City Counciil that visited Los Ange
les lately had a report to make, and he
presented a typewritten document, which
was read by the City Clerk. It was a re
port against the competing system.
"Why was this not made two weeks
ago?" demanded Elliot.
"Fitzgerald wouldn't let me." replied
Baccus.
At this point there was laughter in the
lobby and Aitken demanded that the
chairman "call them down."
"Did you have those figures in your
head or in a book two weeks ago?" In
sisted Elliot.
"I did have them." replied Baccus.
"Did you write that document?" asked
Elliot.
â¢'I helped to write it," was Baccus
reply.
Burns said that the Councilmen in ques
tion had refused to make a report ' two
weeks ago and Elliott declared that no
such figures had been given before as
those in the report.
"I'd rather have seen those figures in
your own handwriting than -on that type
written sheet," said Burns.
A letter from Superintendent Glass of
the old company was read. It offered to
install and maintain fifty telephones for
the city free, to furnish accommodations
to the city for fire alarm wires in the
underground conduit and to give a rate ;
for private house of $1 50 a month. After
this letter had been read Fitzgerald made
a personal rtport favoring the old com
pany and he was scored by Elliott for
changing his views.
This left the Council standing flve to
five with the vote of Councilman Thurs
ton in doubt. Thurston had voted for
the new company two weeks ago. but was
regardfd as doubtful, and during the en
tire evening he made no sign as to what
he would do.
At midnight, after protracted debates
by Councilmen and by attorneys Council
man Thurston finally made his statement,
which was that he intended to vote for
the new company, for while he did not
apprqve of some of the features of the
situation he Celt that the people wanted i
the competition and he was supposed to I
Tr present the people-. The vote on the
final passage of the ordinance calling for
bids for the new franchise stood:
Forâ Burns, Donaldson, Elliot, Meese,
Pendleton and Thurstonâ six.
Againstâ Aitken. Baccus, Fitzgerald,
Hahn and Me Adamâ flve.
The Key Route System to-night pre
sented to the City Council it application
for the long talked about cross-town
franchise . along Twenty-second street.
The matter was referred to the Street
Railway Committee.
The proposed line will cross Oakland
Â©r. Twenty-second street and will fol
low this route: From the tracks of Key
Route on Yerba Buena avenue, along
Ttrba Buena avenue, Louise, Poplar and

avenue to Broadway.
The effer of the Realty Syndicate to
donate a strip of land 44 feet wide on
Boulevard Terrace and 150 feet on Har
rison street, was accepted and a vote of
thanks to the company was carried.
The City Clerk was directed to adver
tise for bids for the sale of the land near
the tidal canal, held as a pest house site.
An ordinance Increasing, the salaries
of the deputy City Clerk and deputy City
Auditor to $150 a month each and an
ordinance creating the office of assistant

An ordinance fixing the tax levy for
the next fiscal year at $1.26 was finally

Leon D: I^ewton'sFreedbrn Brief
Wears a 'Suit That
Ed Smith Gave
Him
Sympathy Shown
at Penitentiary
Wasted.
OAKLAND. Oct. 16.â With the blue
blood of England's aristocracy flowing
through his veins,, ar.d nattily garbed in
the suit the late defaulting Tax Collector
K. J. Smith of Sail Francisco, wore when
taken to Folsom penitentiary, Leon D.
Newton appeared in the criminal depart
ment of the Superior Court this morn
ing- and was sentenced to five years at
San Quentin, he having pleaded guilty
to a charge of petty larceny. He had
admitted a prior conviction and a term
served at Folsom.
Newton refuses to talk of his English
ancestry. While a young man with good
education he' has been a n'er-do-well and
has trailed the name of a good family
in the dust. He was let out of Folsom
only a few weeks ago.
Within the prison walls he had gained
the friendship of those with whom he
came in contact to such an extent that
Smith gave him his suit of clothes and
the guards made up a purse of $50 for
him. Warden Archibald Yell wrote a
personal letter to Ernest -Viayrisch, a
former guard at Folsom, asking him to
take an interest In Newton. The result
was that Newton repaid kindness by
stealing several small rings from Mrs.
Mayrisch.
In a plea for mercy Newton said to
the court: "Instead of finding a place
where I would be helped to keep straight,
I found a home anything but this. I got
in with the very fast set where there
was' a great deal of drinking and for
several days prior to my criminal act
1 was practically drunk all the time and
it is to liquor that I lay my present pre
dicament."
Newton had been making his home with
Mayrisch. who lives at 2323 Buena Vista
avenue, Alameda.
A STORY THAT
IS EVER OLD
AND EVER NEW
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND. Oct. 16. â As the panorama of
society events unfolds Itself the story of love
and marriage eeems to be pictured oftener than
anything else. But our interest never flags â
the bride continues to absorb social attention
and the local smart set is never wlthbutAone
or more engaged girls to heap Its favors upefn.
Few Kirls have been more lavishly enter
tained than has Mlbs Florence White, and her
marriage with Mr. Fattoute next Wednesday is
the chief event of the week. Tall and of
clashing appearance, her costumes always
among the smart creations that are talked
about, Miss White will make a stunning bride.
The popular little Church of the Advent in
East Oakland will be the scene of the wedding,
for which several hundred cards have been
sent out, A quartet of the most attractive
girls in Oakland â Misses Claire Chabot, Flor
ence Hush. Flora MacDermot and Lucretla
Burnham â will act as escort to the bride,
while Miss Marian Goodfellow will be maid of
honor. â¢ . â¢ \u25a0
Ot more than local interest was the marriage
Saturday evening of Miss Winifred Yelland,
daughter of the late R. D. Yelland, the noted
artist, to Roger Phelps of San Fran
cisco. In the studio of hallowed memory the
dainty bride plighted her troth, the deep bay
window lined with ferns and foliage forming a
beautiful bridal bower. Miss Gertrude Snow
of San Francisco, Miss Bertha Clark of Berke
ley and Miss Elaine Goodridge of Santa Bar
bara were the bride's guard of honor. The
first two were bridesmaids, their gowns of
palest blue, while Miss Goodrldge wore a chif
fon jrown of delicate pink.
The bride herself wore a very pretty robe of
whit* point d'esprlt over liberty silk, the veil
caught with orange blossoms and the bridal
bouquet a shower of lilies of the valley. Wil
liam Holling of San Francisco attended the
Mr. 'and Mrs. Phelps will reside In Wlllits.

The wedding of Miss Edith Downing and Dr.
Edger. to take place November 21, will be of
considerable Interest In military circles, as the
groom Is an army surgeon and will take his
bride to Texas, where he Is stationed.
Another wedding that is the center of much
social Interest Is that of Robert Newell and
Miss Frances Warfleld. who have announced
that January 10 will be their nuptial day.
There Is great activity In club circles every
where. â¢ To-day's meeting of the Civic Improve
ment Club was -an Important one. Professor
Booth\of the State University being the princi
pal speaker. He compared the cities of Europe
and the United States and called attention to
many needed improvements in Oakland. He
said tourists passing through Oakland along
the main line past Slxteentn-street station re
ceived a very unfavorable bnpresslon \u25a0of . the
city, and reminded the ladles that street* direc
tions were : very Inadequate. The speaker wa6
right about that. Oakland was laid out like a
purzle map that was put together in haphazard
fashion, and, to add to the stranger's distress,
the majority of the streets are absolutely
namelees, so far as signs or any kind would
indicate. \u25a0 â¢
The club appointed a committee to attend
the City Council meeting to-night to see If
something cannot be done in the matter of the
Alden Library, which is on the point of being
ousted from Its present home to make room for
a saloon. The average dally attendance at the
library is 150 persons, so many are interested
In the matter of Its removal.
It waa also decided at io-day's meeting to
erect a fountain at the Intersection of Broad
way and Sixteenth streets. Plans for the foun
tain will be submitted at the next meeting.
The officers of the Civic Club, recently elect
ed, are: Mrs. Clarissa Morris, president; Mry.

when ' Oakland was but a struggling village
there came to the little community nestling
among the oaks 'from which our city takes Its
name a young priest of God. Father King. He
built this parish and made it what It Is to-day,
and now Father Dempsey, young and strong
In his faith, has come to fill his place.
In his work of carrying forward the up
building of this, the oldest parish in Alameda
County, he deserves your stanch support, and
I am sure he will receive It. I now take
pleasure in declaring the bazaar of St. Mary's
parish open.
The Rev.. Father Dempsey, pastor of
the Church of the Immaculate Concep
tion, and the Rev. Father Sesnon, his as
sistant, each made a brief address, which

HAWK SURVIVES
HIS INTERMENT
Walks Into Morgue Just in
Time to Save Himself
From Being Declared Dead
MISTAKE IN IDENTITY
Satchel in Which Evidence
Was Found Proves to Have
Been Stolen by the Suicide
OAKLAND, Oct. IG.â John Hawk ob
jects to being -regarded as dead and
buried. He walked into the Coroner's
office to-night and registered a long and
strenuous objection to being declared
dead, which step the Coroner's jury was
about to take. He made vehement pro
testation that he was very much alive,
and succeeded In convincing the Inquis
itors.
On Saturday night the body v of.a man
was found in a room in the
House. He had taken strychnine. Billy
Kessler, who conducts Meillete'a saloon
at Seventh and Washington streets, un
der the Clarendon House, identified the
deceased as a man who had left a satchel
in the saloon two days before. Detective
Lynch found in the satchel a number of
letters addressed to John Hawk from a
mother in the East. There was also a
shaving mug bearing the' name Hawk,
and some articles of clothing marked in
the same way. The letter indicated
that Hawk was an expert horseshoer.
Yesterday the body was buried as that
of John Hawk, and the records of the
county and. the Coroner's office show that
Hawk is occupying a grave In Mountain
View Cemetery. -
Coroner Mehrmann impaneled a jury to
pass upon the case to-night and the jury
was just about to find that Hawk had
committed suicide when Hawk walked
In and stopped the proceedings..
There was some doubt in the minds of
the Coroner, and the jury as to which
was Hawk, but the live, man explained
that he came from San Francisco some
days ago and left his grip in Hanifln's
saloon on the corner of â¢ Seventh 'street
and Broadway. When he went to get It
some one secured It by misrepresentation,
and he asserted that the man who had
taken it was the suicide. To prove, his
assertion he described what was in the
grip and told what was in the letters.
Then the jury found that the dead man
was unknown and had committed suicide.
But still, as far as the records of burials
go, John, Hawk is dead and in his grave.
CLASS WILL MEET
\u25a0IN 'GREEK THEATER
Professor Alexis Lange to
Make an Interesting
Experiment.
BERKELEY, Oct. 16.â BSrofessor Alexis
Lange made an announcement to his
class to-day which indicates that an al
most entirely new use has been f ouhd
for the Greek Theater. Professor Lange
informed his pupils. in the class In logi
cal and literary Interpretation that here
after,'until further notice,, the class will
meet three times, a. week in the Greek
Theater for study aDÂ«i lecture purposes..
If Professor Lange's action establishes
a precedent, as seems likely, the Greek
Theater may yet become the busiest -hive
of student activities on the campus. ! Its
great spaces and .splendid proportions
have hitherto been regarded as available
only for such great occasions as com r
mencement exercises; song festivals, ral;
lies of students and ' exercises in which
the entire university might be regarded
as Interested. Now Professor Lange is to
try the experiment of class work In the
big Greek Theater, 1 , and first of the tests
that will be made to determine its fit
ness for such a purpose is the acoustic
test. If Professor Lange and his pupils,
can make themselves heard easily, then
the Greek Theater will probably find
itself regarded with high favor as a meet
ing place for university classes.

FRENCH SAVANT
TO COME WEST
Distingiuslied From
Paris to Deliver^ Lectures
at the State University
HAS FAME AS -% WRITER
Arrangements Made for the
Appearance at Berkeley
;of Professor ' A. Le. Braz
BERKELEY, Oct. 16.â A distinguished
French scholar. Professor : Anatole Le
Braz, -lecturer for the Federation de I'Al
liance Fraricalse, Is to deliver a series of
lectures ; at -the '.University of California
during the week beginning April 23, 1906.
These lectures will be the same Professor
La Braz delivered before the Cercle Fran
cals at Harvard, and are expected to be
of the utmost '- Interest to persons Inter
ested in ,'the French people. "'\u25a0".â¢
The work of Professor Le Braz is de
picted ;by M. Berenger,\ aVdlstlngulshed
critic, in the following appreciation:
\u25a0 The Celtic race is the race '.of mysticism, im
agination and Ideals. â¢ Undercurrents of' long
ings stir the mind and heart of the remnant of
the Celt. .â¢ An undefined reeling of past glory,
a . sense .of decadence, an impression of im
mense . years , weighs upon the Breton.
This nationality one man has pictured. If
one day the ooul of Brittany should be abol
ished by the invasion or modernism literary
men .of the future would find that soul depos
ited entirely as a reliquary of beauty in the
work of Anatole Le Braz. M. Le Braz is, as
he describes himself, a son of the mountains
adopted by the sea. Born in is.VJ at Duoult
in the Area Mountains of Lower Brittany, liv
ing in the various parts of the country, study
ing in Paris, then returning to Brittany as
professor of French and Celtic literature in
the University of Rennes, he has Instinctively
known the yearnings, he has felt the throb of
its emotions and has expressed them in a se
ries of exquisite beauty: transcriptions of tra
ditions old as the Celtic race; legends which
he has made into perfect literature; supersti
tions scarcely whispered upon the expiring
breath of a fading antiquity, still brooding over
men and things; ballads sung by vagrant min
strels and . disappearing cards; customs of
classes varying from white-handed beggars to
woodchoppers and sabot-makers.

Residents of Suburban Town
.Are Considering Plans to
Keep ICotors Out of County
LIVES AEE ENDANGERED
Reckless Drivers Pay No Re
gard to Law or Protest of
the Citizens of the Suburb
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
REDWOOD CITY. Oct. 18.â Tho auto
mobile, as far as Its existence In San
Mateo County ' is concerned." has reached
a crisis. The operation o! these machines
on the highways of the county is so reck
less and so openly In defiance of â¢var^^K
county regulation that 'Immediate meas
ures to protect the lives of people , who
use the roads In vehicles are deemed
necessary by the authorities. So em
phatic has become the angry protest of
citizens, whose lives have been endan
gered by the outrageous irresponsibility
of . high-speeding atxtomobillsts. that
something more drastic than purely re
strictive measures is being urged.-
The Supervisors of San Mateo have been
particularly liberal in their regulations
affecting the conduct of. automobiles
within the limits of the county. A. com
paratively high rate of speed has been
permitted, a generous appropriation of
public money for the Improvement of the
highways practically for the benefit of
automobllists . has been made and the
result has been the abuse of every priv
ilege that has been granted. Public re
sentment over- this unfortunate condition
of affairs is greatly increased by the
well known- fact â¢ that in other counties,
notably Marin. the officials have violently
opposed the . presence of automobiles
rather than encouraged, it as has been
done here.'-
Automobiles race here on the roads at
a terrific speed, forcing the drivers of
vehicles to seek what precarious safety
they may find. Chauffeurs zigzag madly
along the road, insist upon taking the
wrong side of the road, frighten horses
into flight and Jeer at the consternation
of helpless drivers. In many instances
this offence has been committed where
the solo occupants of vehicles have been
women and it has been dangerously a : "V
gravated by drunken crowds racing aion^
the roads in their machines. " .
The result of these abuses in San
Mateo County has been hundreds of run
aways, many collisions in which people
have been bru&ed and maimed and more;
than one death. In their excitement over
the matter residents of the county have
called upon the people, since the authori
ties are inactive, to take the affair into
their own hands, to patrol the toads- with
mounted watches and to stop the abuse
even with violence. The newspapers of
this county have published these sugges
tions with the recommendations that the
Supervisors take action without delay.
The attention of the Supervisors has
been called to the fact that under the
law they may absolutely dictate tne con
duct of these machines and their oper
ators. The authorities have the mutter
under serious discussion and It is -urged
as a measure of immediate relief that all
automobiles be excluded from the roads
In this "county on Sundays and holidays.
This suggestion is considered my many
to be extreme and perhaps unconstitu
tional, but the people here are in a mood
to fight In the courts or in any other way
to protect themselves against what they
consider to be a menace to their lives.
What tha Supervisors will do remains
to be seen.

NEWPORT AN EXCEPTION
Conld Have Been Jlappy
There but for Fear of the
Bold Women He Met
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 16. â A title and a
claim to an ancestral home in Russia
are slipping from the grasp of the
American people, and all because the
possessor of them. Count Molynski of
Welhynion and Paris. Is fearful of
American girls.
The Counit. arrived in St. Louis to
day with hia valet and Is at the Jeffer
son. 'He has been touring America
simply for the fun of the thing, he
says. New York, Chicago and the
other big cities were visited en route
to the West. The Portland fair was
given a few days, as were San Fran
cisco, Yellowstone Park and the Yo
sernite Valley.
"I liked the West as a country," said
the Count to-night, "but the people are
impossible. They are not at all cul
tured and do not know what politeness
means. The servants and car conduc
tors and others of that class are in r
solent.
"The Portland fa> was a bluff. It
â¢was the worst attempt at an exposi
tion I have ever had the misfortune to
waste time over. I wondc-r how they
ever had the nerve to advertise is as
an attraction. . v
"Newport is a delightful place. I
was two weeks there and saw America
at her best. In the Wes,t I saw society
at its worst. I would have been happy
at Newport haji it not been for the
fear I Jiave of American laws as re
gards women.'and fear of the women
themselves. I am told that women can
compel you to marry them here on the
slightest pretext, and that the men
resent another man speaking to their
wives. I have been looking for pleas
ure, you know, not for fights and
trouble. : ,i
"Then the girls do not give one any
encouragement. They are as cold as
stone; beautiful to look at. but as un
approachable as a star. And the men,
too, are cold. They are like wood. It
seems -to me that they are so imbued
with business that they bring 1 It even
into their love-making. I have watched
couples at balls and in theaters, and
their small talk seemed. almost a seri
ous affair. I could imagine the lover
was telling his sweetheart how much
he had made on "change that day.
"Yes, the American woman is more
than beautiful; she is lovely, adorable
and all the rest, but I have only wor
shiped her from afar."

a low one and that of deaths gave gen

PHILADELPHIA, , Oct. . 16.â The great

He made a short speech. "When; he en

stood. up to welcome him. i Governor Folk
said in part:
The most' conspicuous fact of municipal gov
â¢rnments in the United States to-day is that
they are governed by the iew and not by the
people. There Is more- aggressive rottenness
and leÂ«8 aggressive patriotism ; In \ our laiKO
cities than anywhere else. If the I patriotism
can be made as aggressive as the rottenness
the problem- of- good- government would be
solved by the ptople taking the government
into their own hands, l: corruption exists in
Philadelpl*a*the people are to blame; if.cor

for good government will be universal and the

THE MAYOR'S ISSUE.
MAYOR SCHMITZ, in the course of his campaign for the re
election of Mr. Ruef as boss of the city, declares that there
is only one issue at stake, and that is between capital and
labor" He declares that it is the Union Labor party against the
Citizens' Ailiance, and that if the Union Labor party is defeated!
wages will be reduced, labor will be forlorn and famine-smitten, and
â¢he progress of the city will get a serious check. In the beginning
of the Mayor's career many of the more experienced labor leaders
strongly deprecated the separate political action which he organized,
by making a political party out of the labor unions.
These men foresaw the danger of class politics. They under
stood perfectly that such a party would be the prey and instrument
of designing men to promote their own ambitions, and that soon or
late such action would result in the overthrow of the class party by
the combination of all other elements against it. What they fore
saw is sure to be. now or hereafter. The employer of labor is not
the enemy of labor, nor is labor the enemy of the employer. In a
wholesome state of society the laborer of to-day is ambitious to be
the employer of to-morrow, and so a majority of the employers of
Â«his city were once wage workers themselves.
The great harm done by the Mayor has been the arraying of
one kind of workers against another kind. . The employer, usually
once a wage worker himself, does not cease to labor .when he be- ;
comes a wage payer. His work has changed in form only, and un- ;
less he continue to work, to toil in his enterprises, there will be no j
work nor wages for labor. As far as the Mayor or any one else
knows, the Citizens' Alliance can have no interest, as such, in the
result of this election. It professes to desire only industrial equilib
rium, and if citizens choose to seek that result through its instru
mentality that is their lookout.
If it violate the law it is subject to punishment, and the courts
are open for that purpose. As far as the law is concerned the em
ployers of labor have the same right to organize as labor has, and
neither has the right to complain of the other in that respect. The
right to so organize/and stay organized will remain, no matter what
the result of this election. It is not probable that the labor unions
will disband if Schmitz is beaten or that the Citizens' Alliance will
disappear if he is elected. Therefore these two organizations will be
entirely unaffected by the result. They are not in issue except as
artificially put there, to serve the selfish purposes of the Mayor in
his campaign for the re-election of Mr. Ruef. .
The Mayor reads statistics to prove that the city is prosperous,
and takes to himself the credit for it. Oakland is prosperous, where
a labor union party has never elected an officer. Los Angeles in
proportion to its population and capital is more prosperous than
either San Francisco or Oakland, and in Los Angeles open shop is
the rule. Wages there are as good as here, and the investment in
building and other wage paying industries that keep labor busy and
well paid are nearly three times per capita of population more than
in San Francisco. If these evidences do not prove a negative against
the Mayor, we wish to know why they do not.
The Mayor is identifying labor with means, methods and men
that are discreditable. Any one with his eyes open can see some
singular and suggestive things incident to the Mayor's campaign for ;
the re-election of Mr. Ruef. The Mayor's portrait, a defiant, im
pressive and awe inspiring daub in many colors, is displayed on the
saloon doors and walls from the water front to Ocean Beach. Never
before in the history of the city has such a display been made. Now,
keeping a saloon is a business licensed by the city. There are 4000
saloons in San Francisco and nine-tenths of them fly the Mayor's
campaign portrait. Reasoning after the manner of men, we should
say that this almost unanimous choice of one class of business is
not wise for those who do it.
It is a flaring and defiant evidence of the use of official power
by the Mayor's Board of Police Commissioners or by some one in
their name. They grant saloon licenses and they cancel them. .
Every citizen who sees the Mayor's portrait displayed in company
with "the various steam beer and other legends respecting beverages
knows that it means graft. Some who do it expect to receive immu
nity from the police and the Mayor's board, if they violate the con
ditions of their license. Others fear that their license will be can
celed in revenge, though all of its conditions have been kept invio
late. So the Mayor and steam beer share these triumphs of art be
tween them. If his administration of his office were impartial and
honest his portrait would not be- on nine-tenths of the saloons.
The men in that business are of various politics. Some are Re
publicans, some are Democrats, some belong to the Labor party.
They are all capitalists and employers, but seem not to be of that
class of capitalists who have deep and dark designs in the Mayor's
mind. On the surface their cordial union in support ofj the Mayor
indicates a desire to elect a saloon administration as a class gov
ernment for the city. This would be unfortunate for them, for a
reaction would be certain and they would have to take the conse
quences of their united support of the re-election of Mr. Ruef. K So,
while the Mayor is. making a purely artificial issue between capital
and labor his portrait on the saloons proclaims a real issue that is
of interest to the whole city.
Reasoning again after the manner of men, we take occasion to
say to the saloon keepers that, their interest Hes in having an ad
ministration that will impartially enforce the law. They do them
selves injury by creating the suspicion that they want one that will
not.
THE DEATH OF IRVING.
WHEN Joseph Jefferson died his death was lamented here and
in England and his memory was hqnored as that of an actor
who had used the art as an educational influence, and had
refused to degrade the stage. In like manner and for like cause the
death of Henry Irving is mourned in the English speaking world.
For a long period he has led his profession in the legitimate school.
He had the most refined taste in all the accessories of the play.
His attention went into the minutest details of staging. - He
nad the eye and genius of an artist, and used them in directing the
creation of the elaborate scenery used in his performances. It was
sometimes complained that he went to extremes in his stage set
tings, but none of his critics in that respect was ever able to say
what feature among his creations could have been omitted without
marring the general effect, which all admitted was perfect. :
He was as great a favorite on the stage and socially in this
country as in his own. His several tours in the United States were
artistic and financial successes from New York to San Francisco.
The great public saw him only on the stage, and in merely occa
sional contacts, where he was always the perfect and human hearted
gentleman. Those who met him in closer social contact at such
times as he could spare from the exactions of his profession loved
him as a companion and a friend.
One of the grent triumphs of his later life was achieved in Ten
nyson's "a'Becket.'' Irving owned the play and we are not aware
that it h?.s been given by any one else. The poet who wrote it saw
deeply into the mysteries of the human heart, and the psychology of
human conduct. And even in the text it, is a study of the mo3t ab
sorbing and elevating chaiader. . Irving interpreted it as periiapr
no other will.
The transformation of the soldier and courtier and .often time
server, when there was laid upon his soul the solemn obligations of
the church, after he became Archbishop of Canterbury, was brought
out by the actor along the most subtle lines. It was at the close of
a performance of "a'Becket" that Irving died. Those who saw: him
in the play will never forget that last scene, of the murder 'of
a'Becket m the Cathedral. The tragedy is disclosed only at i the
end. but the audience saw the awful shadow of death come upon

RURAL JUSTICE.
The workings of the law in rural
communities are sometimes .marvelous
to behold. In a certain village in the
South several men were, on itrial for
fighting and disturbing the peace. The
encounter hadj grown out of bitterness
engendered by the decisions of the um
pire of a baseball game, and included
many of the well-known residents of
the neighborhood. After great diffi
culty the constable had succeeded In
stopping the fight and arresting five
or six of the bruised and bleeding
combatants. They, were placed on trial
the following day before the Justice of
the Peace, a hard-headed, irascible but
fair-minded old Confederate_veteran.
After the somewhat maimed rites of
opening court had been complied with,
the flr^t defendant was called to the
stand. The Justice did the questioning.
"George Wilson, you are charged
with fightin' and disturbin' the peace
of this community at a ball game yes
tiddy evenin'. Are you guilty or not
guilty?"
"Not guilty." , r ,
' : "What!" shouted the Justice in sur

"Not guilty," the defendant replied.
"Don't you lie to me, sah," the Jus
tice roared, his face purple with in
dignation. "I was there, sah, and <j I
saw you flghtin', myself. I fine you
$10 and costs."
The other defendants, seeing the
trend of events, pleaded! guilty and es
caped with a fine of $5 and costs each.

Many years ago there was a lad who

Which said . he'd like to register as

Then Dobbins took him to one side an'
' said it pained a lot !
\To mention that a register was what
he hadn't got. - .
L'lntrtead of ;' reglstrin' your name," he
then went on to state, â¢/
"The frequent custom here Is this, to git

"Aw, well,'.' says J. Polonius Huss, "it

Then j Dobbins he looked puzzled some,
an', says: "I'll have ter look.

at the word ihe shied, V
Would you prefer your entermol â that is

"I feah,, heah man,", the stranger said,

I'm meanly heah in quest of bugs an' in

"In that there case," says Dobbins then,
"my meanin' I'll make clear; '
Ef you hey come "to my hotel fer bugs,
â¢jestâ disappear!"
He was a most afflicted cuss, was Wil

An' said seen sland'rers shouldn't live to
deal with honest men;
But we all labored with him till he read
his title ; clear \u0084:
To see that they wus ways to deal with
cases like this' here.
He looked up J. Polonius then an" said
he'd been too quick,
An' he could stay at' his hotel. The af
ternoon wus slick,
An' all the boys knocked off frum work
purusant of a game,
Which the same it bein' shockin' I would
not wish to name.
Frum Dobbins' Camp the hills rise up,
an' on them, is a store \u25a0,
Of little 'bugs, an' bigger bugs, an* other
bugs, an' more, â¢
An' when the boys come in that night
their stocks wus somewhat fine, ' '
Though 'gainst the scorpion Slim brought
we had to draw the line. -
When J. Polonius ' Huss sought rest an'
said his evenin' prayer,
He didn't' think his entermol an' all the
rest wus there, '.'\u25a0
An' so we stood outside his door, ncr
dared to breathe ncr smell,
In lisfnin*. . cheerful attitoods to hear
Polonius yell.
He 3 didn't yell, he didn't screech, he
didn't make a noise;
A pain come o'er that happy crowd of
anxious waitin' boys. \
Erbout the time his prayer wus done we
heered him hustlin' round; _
Then, "Halleluyer!" so he says, "a par
adise I've found!"
"It ain't a pair o' dice," says Slim;, "it's
jest a pair o' bugs.
It is a queer deloosion that misguided
feller hugs."-
But when the mornin' come eround
Polonius says this here:
"I weallly think that I must goâ l've in

DOING BUSINESS IN LONDON
Of the business life in London of "Ella
Rawls Reader, Financier." Juliet Wilbor
Tompkins writes as follows In the Oc
tober Everbody's:
"Business in London is done largely
over the dinner table. If it is to be tacit
business., women are asked and the affair
has apparently the brilliant responsibility
of any other social event; for open dis
cussion only men are assembled. Cham
pagne is inevitably the ether through
which all business projects flow. The role
of Mr. Sprague's new partner was largely
that of â¢ hostess. Every one who could
be of service, direct or indirect, to the
Multiple Unit Control was given his
chance and his dinner, and Miss Rawls
presided with a calm grace that never
deserted her, even when, as often hap
pened, she had to take the table a lono
woman with ten or a dozen men. Asking
brilliant companies to meet an inventor
is not always a simple matter; genius is
as likely as not to arrive an hour or so
late, with" a mind above apology and the
traces of the beloved .machinery clearly
visible; but natural ease and a firm belief
in the 'control' pulled the young hostess
through and had their steadily increasing
influsnce in Sprague's favor.
"To these dinners and lunches came
engineers, M. P.'s, peers of the realm,
heads of traction companies, writers lor

Dr. PUlsbury.BAUER'S CONCERT SHOWS
HIM A WONDERFUL MASTER
His Tones Are Marvelous and
His Technique Is Absolute.
GENIUS OF PIANO IS HERE
Harold Bauer opened the piano sea
son last night at Lyric Htill to an audi
ence that grieved that it could not sit
in two seals at once. There should
iiave been more people, that is if to
hear the biggest things of their kind
played in the bigrgest way matters. It
will be with the week's recitals as with
Mr. Bauer's last season, evidently and
unfortunately â seats "to burn" at the
first and crowds "to burn" at the last.
Ou Thursday comes the next, by the
way.
To hear things played as one has
dreamed of playing them â tins is what
one gets from Bauer. This is what
ojie gets from Bauer to a degree-, to me
not reached by any other pianist with
whose art we are familiar here. Per
haps the yods have withheld the secret
of the Chopin B minor Maiurka â say â
from all but De Pachmann. Paderew
ski again has the freedom of the Chopin
"Funeral March" sonata. D' Albert,
crass. magnificent. pour out a
dithyrambic Appassionata Sonata â un
til he gets to the second movement.
But. Bauer does most thingstremendous
!y better than any one else. His tech
nique is absolute; his tone is a succes
sion of miracles; his interpretation tn
oarnate satisfaction to the hearer.
More than ever' does it appear, and this
with the memory of last season's big
pianists still with us, that here is the
master player.
Possibly Bauer is a little at his best
â nay, ?urely â in Schumann. Last
night's Schumann was the "Davids
bundler Tanze." One was grateful to
hear one of the more rarely heard
things given as this was. All of the
Schumann flavor wag here, the whimsi
cal, poetry, the riot and wonder of
color. All men danced for Schumann
through this set of picture dances, and
one almost saw the fantastic crew go
by as Bauer played. It Is not unin
teresting to learn that the pianist had
rot touched the "Davidsbundler" for
two years until last Saturday!
â¢ The programme began with a little
thing by Bach, the chromatic fantasia
jind fugue. Mr. Bauer can play Bach
for me. It is loveliness itself in Its
perfect clarity, balance, "drawing."
The Waldstein sonata was /the Beeth
oven number. Which of this best to
'ike one hardly km'w. Possibly the
:nost beautifully delivered recitative
the slow movement -was the apex
\u25a0^' Sir. Bauer's brilliant achievement
.ere. Then one remembers the finale,
with its little theme given out at first
with almost Infantine delicacy, later
striding giant-like through its forest
of accompaniment. Then the first
number â what more marvelous than
the reading of the little coda, and
the purple and gold of the whole thing
played in imperial fashion. Mr. Bauer
can also play Beethoven for me.
Personally, for pure piano fun, I
think the Alkan. "The Wind" study,
as good as any. A wonderful bit of
technical work it was, wfth its howl-
Ing and sighing scales. The Chopin
was the B minor Scherzo, played \u25a0with
much fire and grace. The lit,tle im
promptu In G of Schubert, and the
Marche Hongxoisc of Schubert-Liszt
completed the programme.
To-morrow night will be given for
the first time here Caesar Franck's
prelude, chorale and fugue, and the
Schumann will be the "Fasching
â¢chwank." No doubt as to the audi
ence after the unbounded approval of
last nigh>t's.

The play "Janice Meredith" drew a
large audience to the Majestic Theater
last night and the stirring scenes of
revolutionary times roused the audi
ence to the greatest enthusiasm. The
play opens on the eve of the revolution
and closes six years later at York
town. A charming love story runs
jLyiroughout the four acts. Pretty
"Janice Meredith, the daughter of Squire
Meredith, and Charles Fownes, her
father's bondsman, afterward a colonel
Â©f the revolutionary army, are the prjn
cipal roles. Color is given the scehes
by the red coats of the British soldiers
and officers.
Edythe Chapman Neill had a con
genial part in the title role and she
played it with vivacity and charm. At
the close of the second act, when she
purprises the British officers by drink
ir.g a toast to the Continental army, and
also at the close of the third act, when
through her strategy Washington's sol
diers ere informed of the drunken con
dition of the Hessian and British of
ficers, which led to a successful at
tack, she was most effective and the
curtain had to be raised several times.
James Neill, as Charles Fownes, was
manly and convincing, but he seemed
to be handicapped by a bad cold. Frank
MacVlcars gave an excellent rendition
of the part of Philemon Hennlon and
he had thÂ« sympathies of the women
in hi* unsuccessful wooing of the
heroine. Franklyn Underwood, as Lord
Clowes; Robert Wayne, as Lieutenant
Morbray; Charles Richmond, as Squire
MÂ»redlth; Reginald Travers, as Squire
Hennion; John Ravold, as Colonel Rahl:
Mina Crolius Gleason, as Mrs. Meredith,
end Frances Slosson, as Tabitha
Drinker, aided In the* success of the
ticca.

The almost unprecedented popular
ity of Winston Churchill's novel, "ThÂ«
Crisis." Is due to many happy combi
nations, not the least among which are
its appeals to patriotism. Its broad hu
manity, and, above all. Its realistic
portrayals of character. These salient
excellences of the novel are concen
trated In the play and have made of It
a success from the dramatic viewpoint.
There was not a vacant seat last night
In the Alcazar and not an Idle pair of
hands as the curtain went down at the
end of each act. "Crisis" requires, above
all things else, a clever company â
one might almost say a bunch of stars.
The company and the stars were there

, portunity of showing strenuousness,
but Charles Waldron can be as effec
tive In a quiet part as well as in one
abounding in action, and he easily
gained and held the sympathies of the
audience. Lucia Moore, the Virginia
Carvel of the play, while not having
much opportunity to display her full
: est powers, was yet so natural in her
rendering of the role that she was re
called again and again.
Colonel Carvel could not have been
in better hands than in those of Henry
D. Byers. In his line he was the star
iof the play. The ; villain â low and
comicâ Eliphalet Hopper, fitted nicely
into the personality of John B. Maher.
i Mr. Van Meter's Judge Whipple was
one of the best things he has done in a
long while. Ernest Glendinning de
serves praise for what he does bo
well in the first act. and Walter Belasco
made of the old negro servant a life
like darky.
Central.
Patrons of the Central Theater last
evening certainly had a full measure
of enjoyment in the big production of
the melodrama, "Tracked Around the
World," which is likely to do a very
big week's business. Based on the fa
mous story of Jules Verne's "Around
the World in Eighty Days," the author
has cleverly strung together a number
of exciting incidents, plenty of good
comedy and a pleasing heart-interest
itheme. The entire company was seen
to the best advantage and all worked
with a remarkable precision. Herschel
Mayall as a detective; Edna Ellsmere
as a wronged heroine; Henry Shumer
as a villain; George P. Webster as an
accomplice in crime; James Corrigan
as a countryman; True Boardman as a
theatrical "angel"; Clare Sinclare as an
adventuress; Lilian Elliott as a woman
of the half-world, and George O. Nich
olls and Charles Edler in important
roles, all did most effective acting.
The specialties by Marion Badger, Lo
lita Robertson and True Boardman, as
well as those by Myrtle Selwyn, Grace
Goodall and a crowd of pretty sing
ers, brought a tumult of applause. The
scenery was massive and realistic
California.
The May Howard Extravaganza
Company gives an abundance of show
for the money, literally and figura
tively. There are ballets, living pic
tures with the limelight on. women
playing cornets and many other fea
tures. A little free and easy in sug
gestion is some of the dialogue, step
ping over the line a bit. and the cos
tumes come close to reaching the limit.
The women cornet players are on the
bill as Ruby Marion and Amy Thomp
son. They do very well. The star per
formers of the company are Lavelle
and Grant, whose acrobatic acts fully
justify the promise about them. The
Craigs do a series of musical stunts
not badly. Of the singing it may be
said that it Is better than is ordinarily
found with extravaganza r companies.
There are many people on the stage at
a time. Lavelle. Locke and Kendall
do their best to imitaie Kolb, Dill and
Bernard. The performance runs fast
and long, going Just about three hours.
There have been many worse shows in
the city that were advertised much
higher.
Columbia. *
This is the second and final week of
Eleanor Robson's successful engage
ment at the Columbia Theater, where
large audiences have been thoroughly
enjoying her production^ of "Merely
Mary Ann." The Btar and her excellent
company are cast to every possible ad
vantage in the Zangwill play and the
result is therefore highly satisfactory.
Chutes.
Sensationalism was found in plenty at
the Chutes yesterday in the daring ex
hibition given by Senor Arnoldo and his
leopards, jaguars and panthers. At
times they showed fight and the audi
ence had an illustration of the su
periority of man's will over animals,
for the trainer never failed to bring
about obedience to his commands,
though there were moments when the
suspense was intense. Lancy and
Schwartz gave an amusing comedy
sketch, and Petronella d'Arvillo, violin
virtuoso, played several selections on
her chosen instrument with much feel
ing. The York 'and Herbert trio "proved
clever singing and dancing acrobats,
and Brown and Wilmont, a versatile
duo, offered fifteen minutes of excellent
fun. Leona Clifton, the popular singer
of illustrated ballads, and the animato
scope, showing the latest novelties in
moving pictures, completed a capital
programme. The amateurs promise a
lot of surprises on Thursday night and
there will be a cakewalk at the Chutes
on Saturday evening after the regular
performance.

lively mix-up in the rotunda of the City
Hall yesterday afternoon. Though the
Nagles were two to one, Attorney Hum
phrey, in sporting parlance, did not take
second money In the encounter. ( â¢
The fight lasted Just one round, but
that one was exciting. The two' brothers
swung simultaneously at Humphrey, out
the latter cleverly sidestepped the com
bined wallops and neatly landed a hay
maker on the jaw of each brother, flat
tening both In Jigtime. . ,
Charles G. and James L. Nagle, the
last named being executor of. the will of
the late Elizabeth Boyne and for whose
removel as euch the Rev. Fathers Yorke,
Wyman and Caraher have petitioned the
Superior Court, appeared before Judge
Coffey in an extremely belligerent
frame of mind. The Nagles were
wroth over the fact that the charges
against them had reached the public
press and demanded to know how it was
that the entire story was published with
such fidelity to detail.
"It was I that gave it to the press, If
you want to know," said Attorney Hum
phrey of the firm of Lent & Humphrey,
"and I will stand by my opinion that
Euch affairs as this are the affairs of
the public and of which they shall have
knowledge."
"I'll meet you anywhere," said Charles
G. Nagle, a victim of his own rage by
this time, "and I think I can settle with
you satisfactorily."
, "1 would like nothing better," responded
Humphrey hotly. ; "In my opinion a meet
ing with you would be the only just way
to settle this affair. It strikes me that
corporal punishment would have greater
effect upon such a mind as yours than
any sting the language of the court's
judgment might. contain."
Ordered to proceed with the hearing,
Attorney Humphrey filed a supplemental
petition for the removal of Executor
Nagle. Nagle then asked ] for a contin
uance, stating that he wanted to answer
new points raised against him. He then
said that he had looked up the record in
the Doll case, referred to by Judge Cof
fey last week, and with some show of
importance said that he had found out
that it did not bear out certain state
ments of the court:
"I did not intend to return to these
matters, Mr. Nagle," said Judge Coffey,
"but if you Insist I will give you further
details. If you had heard that poor
woman in the Doll case recite how your
I brother had told her that he was a
friend of this court and could get any
favor he asked you might better under
stand my feeling."'
"I don't believe It," shouted Charles G.
Nagle. "My brother never was a friend
of yours!"
"I have absolutely no doubt on that
point either," responded Judge Coffey sar
castically, and continuing said: "I hap- ;
pen to know one of the young men that
has suffered at your hands. He is now
an attorney of this city. When you com
promised yourself in connection with his
affairs you sought also to compromise the
court."
"You may find that stuff in the papers,
but you cannot In the court records,"
said Nagle who was drawing near the
contempt line.
"Look here, Mr. Nagle," said Judge
Coffey. "You sit still and keep still. If
you do not you may regret it."
Nagle subsided. The court then ordered
a continuance to enable him to answer
the additional charges that have been
laid against his brother, the accused ex
ecutor.
CAPTAIN OF THE MANCHTJBIA
IN TROUBLE WITH POLICE
Detective Ed Gibson Accuses Him of
Allowing: Default Ins: Mayor of
Paterson to Escape.
Captain J. W. Saunders of the Man
churia, who is in trouble with the Fed
eral authorities over his naturalization
papers, which are alleged to have been
forged, may also find himself in trouble
with the police when he returns from
his present voyage to the Orient.
Â» When William Henry Belcher, the de
faulting Mayor of Paterson, N. J., who
has been located; ln Western Australia,
came to this city he took passage on
the Manchuria, representing himself as
a preacher named" Pilcher. Detective
Ed Gibson was watching the passen
gers boarding the steamship and ar
rested Belcher from a photograph sent
from New Jersey. Belcher was Indig
nant, claiming that his name was
Pilcher, a preacher. He appealed to
Captain Saunders and the captain told
Gibson he had made a mistake', as he
had known Pilcher for several years.
On that positive statement Gibson al
lowed Belcher to leave with the steam
ship.
-If Gibson had held his prisoner he
would have been entitled to a reward
of $2500, which was offered for Belcher's
capture. .\u25a0'. . ."â¢ -

was chosen. . .... ... â¢
Perry for more than fifteen, years has
been superintendent and general ( man

SHROUDED IX 3IYSTERY
Blue and Gold Eleven Will Be
Weakened at the Last Mo
ment hy the Sudden Action
BERKELEY; Oct. 16.â With visions of
a triumph over the Cardinal on the day
ef the big game next monthâ visions in
spired by the freshman victory last Sat
urday over Stanford, the varsity football
squad and the student body as well re
ceived a sharp shock, shattering in part
the vision, when it was made public to
day that the varsity team is to lose its
star end player. R. E. Kittrelle.
There is a bit of mystery attaching to
Kittrelle's sudden withdrawal from the
team and no one, apparently, is able to
assign the correct cause for the clever
player's action. Kittrelle, of course,
could clear up such mystery as there is,
but he declines to discuss the matter, ex
cept to deny that there is the slightest
friction between him and one of the Dart
mouth coaches.
Kittrelle is the second end to resign his
place on the varsity squad this year.
â¢"Bill" Henry had to leave the squad a
â¢week ago, because of Illness. While
Henry is a high class man and his loss
la regretted, the defection of Kittrelle
Is regarded as more serious. The latter
played a swell game on the end last
year, winning his place from a quartette
of promising candidates, and demonstrat
ing in the big game his quality. He was
counted upon to serve this year in the
came capacity, although of course it was
not settled that he would play right end
on the varsity. No man, saye Coach
Knlbbs, is assured of his place on the
varsity team at this stage of the game.
Captain Force said to-day: "Kittrelle
has left us, I understand, though I do
not know Why. He had no trouble with
the coaches, nor with any member of the
equad. All is harmony in the squad,
and the coaches are loyally supported and
mightily well liked, and Kittrelle was
ar.fl is on the best of terms with all of
the men. including the coaches. I be
lieve some outside influence, which has
nothing whatever to do with the football
\u25a0quad, has made It seem advisable to him
to cut out. the game this year."

John Garabaldi, the Football
Player, to Have ah Inning
Soon Before the P. A. A.
The Occidental Athletic Club may fade
from the glare of the pugilistic footlights
after its maiden exhibition, ;.whlch was
held- last \u25a0 Thursday evening,, .for last
night the > registration committe of the
Pacific Amateur A ssociation held a meet
ins and subpenaed the directors of the
club to -appear next Monday for a little
conference. Rumors "that the Occidental
Club did not comply with the amateur
rules reached the ears of \u25a0\u25a0 the amateur
directors, and . they will- now Investigate.
When William Greer Harrison, presi
dent of the Olympic Club, refused to al
low .James McClair. and Frank- Mores,
the winged "O" boxers, to box under the
auspices of the- Occidental Club, the wise
ones knew that something was about to
come . oft Harrison would never have
taken such a stand unless he felt confi
dent that the club was not a strict ama
teur concern, apd he stated it was not.
to the best of his knowledge.
With Sara Berger in the role of high
chancellor, of the new organization, the
club could hardly expect to prosper as an
amateur layout, for Berger lost his stand
ing in the Olympic Club and the P. A. A.
when he turned professional to fight some
months ago. Borger's presence was prob
ably the first motive that inspired the
amateur directors to question the stand
ing of the Occidentals./
The registration committeÂ© refused to
state last night Just what action would
be taken in regard to the club, but from
rumors it would appear that the club
will surely be banished' from the amateur
ranks, unless Its directors can show
strong reasons next Monday night why
it should be retained.
The registration committee also took
up the case of John Garab"aldl, the Poly
technic football player, whose amateur
standing has caused so much comment
lately-4n local football circles. Garabaldi
forced the issue last night by applying
for admission to the Amateur Associa
tion. The registration committee refused
to issue the card till after an investiga
tion. The time for the hearing was set
for nexyWednesday night at the Olympic
Club, when both sides of the case will be
aired.

O'BRIEN TRAINS
AT THE BEACH
Philadelphia Boxer Figures
x>n Building' Up for His
Battle .With Al Kaufmann
MAY WEIGH 170 POUNDS
If Cool Weather Continues
Jack Will Probably Be a
Heavy-Weight in Next Go
"Philadelphia" Jack O'Brien has set
tled down to hard work out at the
ocean beach. He la installed in drain
ing quarters at Sheehan'd place and
will have the honor of being the last
boxer to train at this resort, for Shee
han has said he would, allow no more
boxers to work at his gymnasium. In
fact, it was only after much reflection
that he decided to allow Jack .the priv
ileges of the' place, and had it not been
that the Philadelphlan Is a glassy fel
low it Is very likely he would not now
be working there.
O'Brien boxes nicely at 15S pounds,
and as he Is meeting Kaufmann at
catch weights and will be perhaps
more than twenty pounds lighjter than
Billy j Delaney's champion, he figured
it out that . the beach would be the
proper place for him to do his work,
as he will be better able to build his
weight up In the cool salt air and
thereby decrease the advantage Kauf
mann has over him in the master of
heft. Road work will enter largely in
the training Jack will do, and each
morning he will walk down the beach
for three miles and then return In a
sprint. This will sharpen his wind and
at the same time the fresh breeze from
the ocean will keep the perspiration
back and his weight will begin to go
up in a few days. O'Brien thinks he
may be able (to go Into the ring weigh
ing close to 170 pounds if he does not
encounter a streak or warm weather.
Billy Delaney has about decided to
let Kaufmann do his training at Croll's
Gardens, Alameda. Al has been doing
light work and will only need a week
or ten days to put him in shape for the
bout. . â

CAPTAIN HAKTS GETS
COUET INSTRUCTIONS
Federal Appeal Judges De
cide That He Must Pay
Penalty.
Captain William W. Harts 13 out just
52208 a3 the result of a decision by
the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals, to which body he had ap
plied for relief from a judgment of the
United States District Court requiring
him to pay a fine of $1656 and to suffer
the confiscation of silks and other goods
valued at $552, the property of his wife.
Harts, who is a captain in the United
States Engineer Corps, arrived with his
wife from Manila on July 10, 1903, as pas
senger on the Government transport
Thomas. Harts failed to mention the
dutiable eoods in the declaration blank
furnished him for that purpose by a cus
toms officer. The s.ilks and other articles
were found stowed away among dresses.
etc., in hia wife's trunks. Under tho law
the goods were confiscated and Captain
Harts was fined ?165$â treble their ap
praised value. In its decision the Court
of Appeals says:
If Harts had mentioned to the customs of
ficer at the time he gave his declaration that
he was unable to give a | list of the articles
purchased and the prices paid therefor and
for that reason had crossed, out the printed
clause In relation thereto and that " he had
some pieces of silk and other articles that
might be subject ts, duty and requested that
his trunks and baggage be examined and. that
if anythine was found subject to duty he
would pay the amount required he would ha\-e
brought himself within the rule. But he did
nothing of the kind. . -

GREAT FUTURE
FOR THE COAST
Visiting: .'Railroad Officials
Predict Big- Increase oi
Population in Few Years
EAST LOOKS TO WEST
J. P. O'Brien of Portland and
E. W. Baxter of Wilkes
barre Have Sanguine Views
J. P. O'Brien, general manager of the
Oregon Railroad and Navigation Com
pany, with headquarters at Portland, Or.,
and R. W. Baxter, superintendent of the
Lehigh Valley Railroad Company, with
headquarters at Wllkesbarre, Pa., N who
have been In town the last few days,
have expressed themselves as greatly Im
pressed with the growth of the State,
and also the-ffrowth of the whole coast.
They think the coast has a great fu
ture. -
Mr.. O'Brien said that in hl9 opinion
the whole coast was . going to grow im
mensely in population during the next
few years- Everything pointed that way.
The Lewis and Clark Exposition. Just
closed at Portland, had done a tremen
dous amount of good for the State of
Oregon, and California came in for an
equal share of gain and advertising.
Mr. O'Brien said that while the figures
had not been fully compiled as regards
to the number of people who came from
the East to the exposition he thought
the number would be approximately, in
the neighborhood of 500,000. Practically
all of these visited California. The
travel between Portland and thU city
was about equally divided going north
and south. Half a million people seemed
a large number to travel to the coast
to. see an exposition, but the fact re
mains that about that number did coma.
The exposition was the greatest adver
tising medium for the coast that could
have been invented. It brought a class
of people of means, who were of much
advantage to the States of the West.
San Francisco Impressed him a3 having
a wonderful growth.
Mr. Baxter agreed with Mr. O'Brien
that the Portland fair had been a great
advantage to the coast, and he thought
that fully half a million tourists had
come .out to the coast during the last
few months. He said it was some years
since ha had been on the coast, and he
was greatly surprised at the strides it
had mafic. He was particularly surprised
at the big growth In size. buildlng3 and
population of San Francisco- He said his
business kept him traveling between Wll
kesbarre and New York, and brought
him naturally in contact with large num
bers of people who had been "here this
summer. He said one and all had a good
word for the coast and what they had
seen here. He predicted a- great future
for the whole coast, and this city In par
ticular.
Mr. O'Brien left for Portland las: night
and Mr. /Baxter will leave for the East
to-night.
Dies From Gas Asphyxiation-
Manuel Dutra was found dead in nls
room at 33A Kisslins street early yes
terday morning-. He was kneeling be
side his bed and gas was escaping:
from an open jet. Mrs. E. Murray, tho
landlady, told Deputy Coroner Meehan
that Dutra had been drinking heavily
and she believed his death was acci
dental. ' The body was taken to the
Morgue. Dutra was a member of the
Laundry Workers' Union and a Druid.
He was a single man.
MINNIE ADAMS' TRIAL CONTINUED.â
The third trial of Minnie Adams on the CEarye

sent a continuance was ordered till October 30.

terdaj- said:
"In the first half of the day. when .cÂ«ll
money was ruling around C per cent, the mar-
Vet was heavy and Icucr. The volume of busi
ness was very small ar.d the trading element
\u25a0Â»â¢â¢ inclined to wait for improvement in con
nectton with the Japanese bond payment and
ite influence on the money market. In the
afternoon, when call money eased off short
covering caused seme recovery In prices and
:n the last hour, when ca'.l money wu down
to per oer.t. there was some fairly good buy
â¢ r.g. which caused a general recovery. -
â¢ Official figures regarding the exact amount
cc.led for to-day under the final Japanese
ioan subscriptions installment are not Â»vall

Xew York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 1 6. âThe . spirit of enter
prise was practically dormant in thÂ« stock
market to-day and the amount of business
done was Insignificant. Habitual operators in
stocks find no encouragement to take part In
the market in the face of the admonitory at
titude of bankers and- influential capitalists
and the cautionary tone of public comment on
the situation. On the other hand there is no
obvious preÂ£6ure of stocka in the market
sc-ekir.g liquidation, and professional operators
for thiÂ» reaaon refrain from attacks on the
rr.arket In attempts to get rrlces lower. To
day's Immediate development* -were calculated
to Inspire respect fcr thÂ« conservative atti
tude maintained by rreat interests toward .
the market. There was no flurry "In", the money
market and no active recall of credits tabu
lated to force Ftocks on the market, but the
tendency of quotations for money was clearly
enough upward in ' &1I the great' money cen
ters, and no new source of relief from the
money j.ressure- was uneoveifKl. Apprehensions
that the final arrangements for the payment
of rh'- Japanese loan eubscriptiens would dis
tuib Lbe . â¢ t! money market proved unfoundei}
ar.'j jprcrently the payments on that account
we;., quickly redeixislted and made their re
ajiiJtarance In the money market. But beyond
the immediate effect of the actual passage
Â«jf *hete funds. Interest attaches to the ulti
mate destination of the deposit* thus ee
Â«.ured to thÂ« credit of the Japanese Govern
ment, It is the general supposition that the
iToc^eos of the -earlier loan in settlements,
formerly on dej>Osit in New York, have been
pretty completely remitted to foreign tfeposi
icrloo, so that the present deposits of the
"Japanese Government in New York may be
l;resumed to amount approximately to the turn
et the Dortion of the last loan placed in New
York, which would caJl for about $40,000,000.
There is no expectation that this. amount would
be left In New York for any long period, the
fcnjectqre in banking circles pointing to the
%-nd.of the year as the probable oeriod for
completing the remittance. The foreign ex
change market was notably strong to-day and
this promoted an inference that preparations
ivere already making for remittance of the
Japanese fund*. The supply of bills for ex
change also conies from former borrowers of
iorcign funds, who .calculated upon a supply
6f exchange Â«t this time to buy bills at. a
profit for repayment of other loans. This course
of events hae led to the definite abandonment
of the hojie of securing any additional gold for
N*w Tork in the immediate, future, and It Is
Kfnerally believed that no further eupplies are
likely to l>e secured for the rest of the year.
It is plain that the Bank of Erteland has,se
cured deflnlte control of the .London money
market end London expects an advance in the
bank rfete of discount on Thursday. The In
elasticity of the market was a .conFr.lei:ouÂ»
feature and the small e&rly declines were
rather more than recovered on the dull'ab
sorption of the day. The special firmness of
the coalers wm due to the consideration' of '
:art week's purchase of the Coxe Bros, prop
erty. The market closed firm, but eemi-etag
ntint.
Hohds were Irregular. Total sales, par value.
$2,750,000.
United States bonds' were s.ll unchanged on
call.

New York Cotton Market.'
NEW YORK, Oct. 16,-^The cotton market to
day"'has been heavy and lower. The antici
pated heavy frosts'in the cotton belt did .not*
.materialize over. Sunday, but. on the -contrary,
weather conditions were rarorable, and these
were th? dominant Influences making for lower
prices. The market movement hingee entirely
I urxm weather, conditions and will continue to
Ido po for some time. It is In a position where
1 a sudden .change in the weather or the appear-
I ance of any killing irost would bring about a
reversal of position en the part of the majority
of traders, and also stimulate a sharp upward
movement In prices. â¢ . \u25a0'â¢...,
Business ' to-day was about the smallest In
I weeks. The traders seemed to- hesitate be
lt ween the" favorable conditions In the weather
and the fear of a bullish crop report at noon
to-morrow. â¢
. Tho market turned easy on the later trade on
selling by ring leaders who had bought for a
recovery, and .this, with tsume bear pressure,
rendered the market weak.
The movement of cotton continues heavy at
the porte, .but interior receipts show some fall
ing off. , >- ......
There Is getting to be such a- difference be
tween the parity of future options and .the
fcpot market of the South that it tends. to check
aggressive selling. It remains to be seen which
one will give in, ;the South to sell'or shorts'to
cover, future commitments.
. Beer wire* : President Jordan of the South
ern ..Cotton. Association says: ."The crop !s
matured and mostly gathered already in all the
; States and the producurp are now basing their
claims on actual "and _ not prospective news.
Killing frost would do no damage to the crop.
: now, except in a few scattered localities.. .
"Many gin* In the best cotton sections of the
, .S&utlv are now running on half time, where
1 last year they were in full mast." ' ; ' '
\u0084 The . impression is that Price Is selling the

BIGAMIST GETS
HIS SENTENCE
(jt'orge A. Jackson Ordered
to Pay Fine of* $1000 and
Spend Two Years in Prison
FAILS IX PROBATION
Bert E. Rodgers Accuses Him
of Breaking Up Home aiid
(jaining Wife's Affections
George A. Jackson, a young teamster
convicted of bigamy, was sentenced by
Judge I^awlor yesterday to pay a fine of
$IwXj and to serve two yoars in San
Quentln. He pleaded guilty on April 18.
1304, and was allowed to go on probation.
On October $, when the case was called,
he failed to appear and the Judge issued
a bench warrant for his arrest.
Meantime Bert E. Rodgers. an engineer
living at Harbor View, notified the JudgÂ«
that Jackson had stolen "Mrs. Rodgers'
affections. Rodgers and his wife were
subpenaed to be in court yesterday. The
husband testified that he married Mrs.
Guadalupe Johnston, a' widow with three
children, on August 29. She wrote to
him while he was in Nome that she had
been livins with Jackson since, but the
witness forgave her. Two days after they
were married Jackson called .at their
home at 323S Folsom street and Jackson
kissed Mrs. Rodgers in her husband's
presence, and told her that if she had any
trouble tvith her husband to come to him
and he would protect her. Rodgers or
dered Jackson never to come to his house
agrain, but his wife has been meeting him.
Twenty-nine days after they were mar
ried Rodgers left his wife. ,'
Jaclcson explained to the court that . he
had simnly roomed at Mrs. Johnston's
house and denied that there ever had
been any other relation between them ex
cept as landlady and tenant. He accused
Rodgers of having beaten his wife. â¢ till
she was black and blue, and that was
why he had told her to come to him for
protection.
Mrs. Rodgers, a pretty Spanish woman,
corroborated Jackson's testimony. She
told the Judge that she had sworn to a
warrant before Police Judge Cabaniss for
her husband's arrest â¢ on a charge of
threats to kill.
The Judge read the riot act to husband
and wife and to Jackson, and sent word
to Judge Cabaniss by Policeman Collins
to withhold the warrant for. threats to
kill till it eouid be -seen how Rodgers
conducted himself. V
The charge of bigamy against Jackson
wa.< bast-d on the fact that "he" married
<"arn;eliw MrClain in this city-in .theâ¢be
ginning of JCKS. and . on December 17 of
iliat year he married Mabel Nutting.
wirtVoui having obtained a divorce from
the former.

WRIGHT'S TRIAL
NEARLY ENDED
His Counsel Contend That
Evidence '\u25a0 Does Not \ Fit
Charges \u25a0'-" Indictment
ACQUITTAL ASKED FOR
Schlesinger Insinuates That
; Money -Might Have Been
> Taken by Some One Else
BertM. Thomas, United States Inter
nal Revenue agent, was the first wit
ness called for the defense yesterday in
the trial of; George -A. Wright, former
Chief Deputy Internal, Revenue Col
lector, for embezzlement. Mr. Thomas
was required particularly to describe
the safe in which Deputy. Wright kept
moneys paid him, and Attorney Schles
inger laid stress upon the fact that the
vault was in the? main office, in which
were twenty-two employes,, some ' of
whom had access to the vault..
Collector Lynch, in reply. to a ques
tion, said that .Wright's. father,. eight: or
ten days . ago, - gave him a note for
$4252, the sum paid, by Lynch Novem
ber 3, 1904, to make good young
Wright's apparent shortage. The â¢ note
was backdated "November 3,. 1904."
' H. O. Beatty, attorney at law; and
son of Chief Justice Beatty of the Su
preme Court; J. H. Barland, manager
of the United States Fidelity and
Guaranty Company, and Clem G. Per
kins, cashier of the Custom-house, tes
tified that Wright had always borne a
good reputation. Other witnesses. were
called to testify to the same fact, but
upon United States ' District Attorney
Devlin; admitting that the defendant
had, always borne a good reputation,
Judge de Haven refused to allow them
to be^examined. \u25a0 - 7; ;
The 'case was then closed, so far as
the taking of testimony was con
cerned.
Assistant United States District At
torney; A. P. Black made the opening
argument for the Government, and was
followed by Bert Schlesinger for 'the
defendant. Schlesinger took the ground
that the Government had utterly, failed
to prove that Wright had committed
either embezzlement or larceny. He
might have failed to deposit money' in
the.subtreasury in accordance with
the regulations, but he, was not, charged
with that in the indictment and ho was
not being tried for that offense. He
called the attention of the jury to the
fact brought out in evidence that the
security 'company whlcll was on
Wright's official bond for $10,000 had
not been called upon to make good
Wright's alleged shortage, although
Collector Lynch had testified that' he
paid it himself-
Mr. Schlesinger will finish his ar
gument this morning and will be fol
lowed by Samuel M. Shortridge of de
fendant's counsel. Mr. Block will close
for the prosecution.
RUMBLE TELLS
OF LOST GOLD
Man Convicted in Federal
Court Kesists .an Attempt
to Make Him /Disgorge
G. W. Kumble, .whose activity as the
promoter of the Sunset Mining Com
pany, owner of the Old Glory mine of
Buttc County, caused his conviction in
ithe Federal court for using the United
States mails to defraud, was on the
stand In Judge Graham's court yester
day trying to explain what has. become
of some $200,000 received by. him
through sales of stock.
It is alleged by, Dix W. Smith, who
'is suing him on behalf of the stock
holders of the Sunset' Mining Company.
tha<t Rumble, who dominated the board
of .directors, ! misused much of the
money of tho corporation to pay fake
dividends on stocks,, thereby, stimulat
ing increased speculation,, claiming
that the \u25a0 dividends came out or the
mine. It is further charged, that he
appropriated many thousands to his
own- use and through a conspiracy per
mitted Mrs. M. A: , Fritz of "Santa Cruz
to- recover a judgment ' against the
â¢company for .$12,000 and H. A. Har
dlnge -of tho same county to ; recover a
judgment for $1960. W was to account
for' these various transactions that he
Avas called before Judge Graham yes
terday.
'Rumble said that the present-, pre
dicament of his mining company was
due to the fact that he . was persecuted
by United ' States secret service men
and that State Mineralogist . Aubury
also aided in unjustly bringing about
his undoing. .He \u25a0 asserted that as a
matter of fact he took ores from his
mine that netted the company; $168,000,
and that all dividends were paid legiti
mately. . . . â¢ . .
Asked what had become of all of .this
money he could not say. Of the sum,
$60,000 went, -he i. knew,; to send \u25a0 two
men to Alaska" to seek for : new ; min
eral lands for the? company. ; â¢ Both of
the ; men died -there, ; no- said, ' and , what
became of the' property they were" sent
to acquire he never learned. C The rest
of the money, he : said, went in the
natural decline of, things; when.hls per
secutors gained i the* upper \ hand. - How
it 'went he could not tell he
said, on two occasions \u25a0 interesjted per
sons, had -raided his -office and carried
away his books,";leaving;-him L without
memoranda*on*which ,to ;work.
*, He: came here from England, \ he said,
with ;$100,000: arid this i had ; gone.; too.
He "didn't^ owe the Sunset' Mining i Com
pany a, cent,! he/said, and .if : he. 'could
find his books hc;could prove it. '

She Bears Burden
of Fighting
Wolf
Mrs. Eva Hibbard, when requested
by Police Judge Mogan to disclose her
husband's confessed reason . for neg
lectingV his household, declared .that
nobody could ever guess it.
"Drink or laziness," his Honor ven
tured. ; ,
" "Wrong," exclaimed the lady, in tone
triumphant.-- "Try another."
Informed that an unusually heavy
calendar, even for Monday morning,
prohibited the court's indulgence In
the pastime of .solving riddles, Mrs.
Hibbard ] ejaculated :
"Yes, V sir; . swimmin' and wadin*
and sittin' in th' mud, He don't
drink a^drop an" he was a hard
workin' carpenter till â¢ he got ' stuck
on ; goin' in " swimmin'. Now he
dlz â¢ .nothln' ,els~e . from mornin' -till
night but swim an' wade an' sit in the
mud, leavin' me to get the livin' for
both of us an* th' baby by dressmakin'.
Did you ever hear of such a thing?"
The court never had, and asked Mrs.
Hibbard how her spouse had acquired
his natatorial mania. She replied that
he. had been advised to take salt water
baths for. a cutaneous affection, and tho
treatmeiit proved efficacious, but trans
formed ; him into a'" human ' amphibian.
He couid not shake off his desire to
dip in the^ briny, and .instead of seek
ing employment that would maintain
his family he .spent, his evenings *in
consultation, with tide tablcs;and his
days in communion with Neptune.
. Fearing the treacherous undercur
rents that make bathing in the Ocean
Boach such a risky thing,' he drew
upojv the scant- domestic treasury v - to
provide himself with daily transporta
tion to Alameda,. where the bay, though
muddy of bottom, could.be entered with
impunity. Moreover; -.he had enlisted
quite a number of young men to par
ticipate wittf.'hirh in the billow-buffet
ing, and she had heard that. the crowd
was facetiously termed "The Mud Tur
tles"-bys'ome arid "The Brotherhood of
Terrapins" by others.. .
Mr. Hibbard pleiided ; that his eczema,
so ; far from ha ving 'completely yielded
to the daily saline immersion, was only
beginning .to "\u25a0 vanish, ;and , still- Inca
pacitates him from'; toll 'at his trade.
"Why don't lie get a sack' of sea
salt and take his baths. at homer* Mrs.
Hibbard inquired. - "If -> he'd : only take
care of "the baby \vhile I'm working I
wouldn't care so much."
Mr. Hibbard' agreed *to' do as his bet
ter-half suggested, and the Judge gave
him 'thirty days to prove the sincerity
of his promise. /.
Ah Hun'erected a 12x12-foot ; wooden
cage atop: of the building. he partly
occupies at 615 Kearny street with
out having obtained tho J requisite per
mit to engage in house extension, and
when he pleaded that the structure was
Intended to imprison birds Judge Ca
baniss asked him if he was going into
the business of- breeding ostriches. Ah
Hun grinned his appreciation of ; the
sarcasm and , then pledged.' his word
that the cage would be removed.

WilJJcm B. Cameron, whose birthplace
is somewhere in the land where the
heather blooms, came to San Francisco
w-lch a , line of drygoods samples and a
tesire to inspect the city's wide-famed
'night life, and after business , hours Sat
; urday he sallied forth from , the Palacd
j Hotel to ' gratify his yearning.
I In the Tenderloin he met two young
women with whom he experienced no dif
ficulty whatever in forming acquaintance,
and under their guidance he flitted from
dive to dive until the unpleasantness oc
curred which resulted in his arrest on
I complaint of one of his fair companions
who alleged malicious mischief and ex
â¢hibited . the fractured tip of her hat
feather as proof of the allegation.
- According to the story .unfolded before
Judge Fritz the trio were in an Ellis
street resort when there entered a young
man who was effusively greeted by the
ladies and invited by them to partake of
Mr. Cameron's hospitality, an Invitation
which, was promptly and graciously ac
cepted.
"You are all right, kid," said one of the
females, "but I don't like your lid. It's
punk."
So saying she plucked off the young
man's headgear, a rather dingy article,
and deliberately put it out of commission
by ripping brim from crown. The young
man waxed very indignant, apparently to
the young woman's surprise, for she re
quested Mr. Cameron to pay the cash
equivalent of his ruined hat and thus
rid the company of his annoying pres
ence." Mr. Cameron, who was a canny
chlel, considered the young man's valua
tion bf the hat's original worth extremely
exorbitant and so Informed him, and the
young woman then angrily accused Mr.
Cameron of stinginess.
"Tut, tut, lassie," quoth Mr. Cameron,
"I'm nae sic a fule as I luk. Ye'canna
pu' th' woo* ower my een. I'll nae stan*
tae be sweendled. In lther wurdies, ye've
got th". wrang. mon tae fule wiV*
Mr. Cameron then started to leave the
apartment, and,' as he did so his elbow,
either or through design on
the part of the young. woman, broke the
tip of her ostrich hat 'l feather. He re
fused to pay for. that damage, also, and
his arrest on her complaint of malicious
mischief ensued. . \u0084
As there was no appearance for the
prosecution the case was dismissed.
, For stealing a* gallon demijohn of
claret from the store of E. Glrard, 621
Pacific street, Nick Stafford was given
six months" by Judge Conlan. The* se
verity of thesentence was owing to the
fact that Mr. Stafford, while previously
awaiting trial .on a 'larceny charge,
jumped his bail.

/ Judge Mogan will to-day decide
whether Mrs. Dora Messersmith of 29

not only' by. Mrs. Peterson herself, but
also by Mrs. Mary > Bray of 27 Grand
street. Mrs. Mollle Kilgen of . 25 Grand
street and Mrs. Emma Schultz'of 31
Grand street.
Mrs. Peterson told the court that her
husband, who is employed at the Lick
Baths, had Â» confessed to Her that Mr 3.
Messersmith gave him drinks, which in
formation did not tend to enhance Mrs.
Peterson's -esteem for Mrs. Messer
smith.
Mrs. Messersmith admitted that she
slapped -Mrs. Peterson's face, but said
she had been provoked to do so by Mrs.
Peterson' pulling; her coat. The pulling
and slapping occurred at the front door
of Mrs.'. Messersmith's domicile, where
she found Mrs.. Bray. Mrs. Kilger and
Mrst. Schultz sitting upon the steps, and
it was her request that they permit her
to enter the house that led to the coat
pulling by. Mrs. Peterson, whose accom

\u25a0GAIN.--POX HALL 3IIS'OES
North Pacific Coast K. K. Co.
Must Pay for Sinking of
Sari Rafael l>y Sausalite
The United States Circuit Court *
Appeals handed down a decision yest**"
day increasing the amount of ("amaiw
awarded by the ' United States District
Court to Ãbelants in the casÂ« of James
S. McCue and two ca^za brought by
Catherine Hall and Her minor children
against the North Pacific Coast Railroad
Company for loss of life and property
on the occasion of the sinking of the
steamer San Rafael by the steamer Sau
salito on November 1 10, 190 L AlcCue had
sued for J300.0C0 damages and the HalJ
\u25a0widow and minors for 150.000. Judge dÂ«
Haven had awarded McCue $1300 and the
others 55000. The United States Court
of Appeals increased McCue's damages
to $5000 ' and awarded the Hall widow and
children $7500.
.Among other statements made in thÂ«
decision Is the following:
Equally without merit Is the suggestion thai
the enforcement of the Hen against the steamer
Sausalito would work a wrons upon an in
nocent purchaser. In the first place the lion
for a maritime tort according to the maritlm*
law accompanies the vessel into thÂ« hand*
of even a bona fld9 purchaser. In the next
place thÂ« claimant was not an innocent pur
chaser of-the steamer Sausalito for the record
shows it purchased during the pending of the
I'mlted liability proceedings which diacfoee the
libe.'ant's demands. The court below allowed
the libelant McCue the sum of $t3CO only for
the damages â¢ sustained by him. The casÂ»
shows that he lost $400 in money, a suit of
clothes estimated by - him to bÂ» of thÂ« value
of $50. a watch valued at $I*o and that he
paid $30 for medical attendance, so that ths
court below awarded him only $ICOO for his
personal Injuries. We are of tha oninlon
that such allowance was altogether too low.
It la not -denied that one of his arms was
1 broken, one of h!s hands mutilated and part!?
' disable*] and' that a part of cne of his ears
was, cut off- He also testified that he was
rendered permanently deaf in one ear by reason
of the collision and that he suffered other
serious Injury. Considering all of the facts
and circumstances oT* the- case, including thÂ»
age of the libelant. we are of the opinion that
bis damages should be. and hereby are, ftxeil
at the aggregate sum of $3000.
One of the judgments against the rail
road company. in favor of the Hall minors
is reversed and cause remanded with di
rections tp the court below to dismt?-*|
the petition at petitioner's cost. X |
The other judgment ,in favor of thÂ«
Hall minore is remanded so modified as
to award $7500 damages and costs.

" My left hand was almost covered *
with a large red sore which would itch
terribly.. I doctored with it four
months, also tried everything I could
think of, but I would only have tem-
porary relief. A competent physician
of Kansas City shook his head and
said, "lt looks bad." Then a friend
told me of Cuticura* and as I had tried
so much, I thought I might as well try
that too, and I bought a set of Cuti-
cura Soap, Ointment, and Resolvent.
Just three days and nights after I had
taken the first dose, the inflammation
had all gone from the sore; and when
I had taken three bottles and a half of
Resolvent, my hand was all welL
