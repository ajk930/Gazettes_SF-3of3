Avalanche Sweeps
the Union Labor
Ticket In.
Eugene E. Schmitr is re-elected Mayor
by a majority of 10,000. ' The avalanche
for Schmitz carried with^ It all the nomi
nees on the Union Labor ticket The
vote was lar^e. approximating: 74,000.
Managers of the fusion â¢ campaign were
greatly surprised, but are'ready'to enlist
aga^n for another battle to redeem the
city from the curse of graft. While 41,000
rr.tn voted for Schmits 31,000 men spoke
for a better and cleaner government than
has been given to the city by the Ruef-
Echmitz regime. â¢ â¢**.'
SchmJtz will have a sympathetic Board
of Supervisors to assist him in carrying
out his policies of municipal government
In the past he has constantly ascribed
his failure to accomplish .something fcr
the advantage of the public to the resist
*nce of unfriendly Supervisors. Men ot
his own kind have been chosen to consti
tute the municipal legislature. It remains
to be seen whether the Mayor and Super
visors will be able to get some work for
the public. out : of the Board of Public
Work*.
It goes without saying that W. H. Lang
don, as District* Attorney; William G.
Burke, as City Attorney; S. Wells Hor
tcn, aa Auditor; Colonel Thomas F
O'Neill as Sheriff; Harry L Mulcrevy.'
es County Clerk; J. F. Nichols, as Tax
Collector; John H- Nelson, as Recorder;
Charles A. Bantel, as Treasurer; William
J. Walsh, as Coroner, and Joseph A. Stulz
es Public Administrator will stand In with
the Mayor and cheerfully assist . him in
his enterprises to Improve: the city, clean
the* streets and promote the happiness ot
the people.
The notion may prevail in some circles
that Earn Horton will not make an ideal
Auditor, but taxpayers who are appre
hensive on this score may take courage
from the reflection that Horton as Audi
tor can always appeal for ..advice, and
legal guidance to the Incoming City At
torney. William O. Burke. Every one
who knows anything about \u25a0 law knows
that Mr. Burke is as well qualified, for
City Attorney as Mr. Langdon la for Dis
trict Attorney, or as Mr. Horton is for
Auditor.
The Mayor's chief advisers will surely
be A. Rnef; P. H,- McCarthy. Thomas F.
Eagan, George J. Berger and W. H.
Lanpdon. Ruef will want all the offices
for bis own followers and this will cause
â¢ome embarrassment to McCarthy, Eagan
and Berger. Promises are out. in layers
of five and ten for every patronage place
In the gift of the administration. It
would not surprise the politicians If the
Union Labor County Committee shoulii
make a straight out demand to control
the patronage. Irrespective of Ruefs de
trires. The committee may take the posi
tion that ; the Union Labor party, as an
organization will be held directly respon
sible for. the administration of municipal
affairs, and therefore its governing, body
should name thÂ« men for_ leading and su
bordinate place* on the various commis
sions.
There is one ray of consolation for the
people who are opposed to.' the'; Ruef-
Bchmiu regime and that is the fact that
the Police Department Is about as ineffi
cient as It can be, and that any: change
In the Department of Public Works Is

It Is an axiom that the people get <as

of Ruef and Schmitz what she deserves.

the election yesterday. .The issue was

gates Several Complaints
Notwithstanding the intense Interest
that attached to the election It -mas or
derly and quiet. Personal encounters and
offenses against the election laws were
few and widely scattered, a fact, how
ever, that can be attributed to the elab
orate preparations made by the Repub
lcan League and the fusion managers to

person caught in tbe commission of

The Grand Jury held a continuous ses
eloa in its rooms at the City Hal] d urine
the day with Foreman Mitchell in charge
for the purpose . of investigating com
plaints filed relative to the violation of
election lawE. The fact that the Grand
Jury was on watch no doubt also de
terred many of the push from commit
ting Infractions of the law.
A force of special officers was kept on
hand, and as fast as the complaints were
received- from Grand Jury' watchers in
the various precincts an officer was. de
tailed to make inquiry- One of the first
complaints to be made was that liquor
was being passed around to the election
officers in the precinct of the Twenty
eighth District located at 156 New Mont
gomery street. When a grand Juror ap
peared at the booth the liquor had dis
appeared.
VOTES ILLEGALLY ASKED.

voters in the Second Precinct of the Thir
ty-eighth District were being solicited to
vote for low license. Park " eald : the
dummy voting machine on, the outside
of the booth was being Utilized to r urge
the voter to vof^ against -high license.
The Grand Jury sent a man out to inves
tigate and the person complained of was
made to atop his soliciting.

NOISY CROWDS
ON THE STREETS
Jubilation Is ManifesteH by tlie
Schmitz Adherents in a â¢
The adherents of the Union Labor
party simply took possesÃlon of Market
and the adjoining streets lastÂ«night. Such"
enthusiasm and celebrating has not been
known for many a moon. When the re
6uit of the election was flashed over the
Call's bulletins at 5:40. the crowd be
gan to assemble, and from that time on
it was one big carnival Â«cene that lasted
all night long. .\u25a0
The enthusiasm of the followers of
Ruef and Schmitz knew no bounds. This
crowd yelled and cheered and blocked,
the streets and made merry till, they at
tracted the hangers-on about town. The 1
name of tbe Union Labor" candidate
seemed to be In every man's mouth and
they all cheered for him as the conquer
ing hero and the greatest man the city
has yet" known. â¢ .
1 Mayor Schmitz spent a very quiet even
ing. As. soon aa he satisfied himself that
be was elected beyond the question of a
doubt, he repaired to his home and spent
tlie evenings quietly with his wife and
family. He was kept busy opening tele
grams of congratulation and receiving
magnificent floral offerings from' his vari
ous friends.:*' \u25a0â¢\u25a0' - ; - ' :â¢' ' * :. i- -Jn
\u25a0 It may be justly said that Abe Rduf
was absolutely the happiest man in, San
Francisco. All day long . the political
leader was seated high on the anxious
seat, but when he waa finally convinced
that 'Schmitz would rule over â¢ thÂ« town
for another term, his enthusiasm knew
no. bound*. He was a different man in a
twinkling. He had triumphed over the
fusion forces by a big majority and hap
piness was his. ........ -. â¢ >
Of course he was the center -of the ad
miring throng, as the Mayor was not to
be seen along the line. Ruef was always
ready with the gladsome speech^and was
never too tired nor* too elated -to, reply
when the crowd â¢ asked for a few worfls.
He quickly organized a procession " and
led It all, along the -principal streets, pro
claiming the victory of Schmitz and de
nouncing his enemies, much to the de
light of his followers. â¢
The parade was an informal sort of an
affair, yet It attracted widespread atten
tion, and the crowd that -.followed it and
looked on simply blocked/ 'streets and
sidewalks and made tra,inc along ttie busy
thoroughfares weU' : l high V impossible.

Ahead: of Qther f?aj3ers; i
.Th* Call won a. fweeplng' victory over
Its competitors in the bulletin service yes
terday afternoon and* evening. Every
time the news was flashed The; Call was
nrst In the field. The crush in front of
the big building at Third and Market
streets became unbearable about Â« o'clock
last night .when the . crowd finally awak
ened to the fact that the news was com
ing first there, and from that time on the
multitude eagerly watched The Call's bul
letins tot the news.'. \u25a0";\u25a0\u25a0â¢ â¢
The bulletins began to arrive early in
the afternoon, and. the perfection. to which
the election machines had been reduced
"enabled the workers . at the ; polls "to gef
the news in early. The Call had speclaj
men detailed â¢ in aIL the \booths through
out the city,' and whenever a precinct was
given but the result was flashed upon the
bulletin boards in record time, and so the
crowd - was kept informed right . along. \u25a0 .
The, most : spectacular . triumph achieved
by The Call was the announcement of. the
election of Schmitz at precisely -6:40.;, It
was then that the news of the victory of
the Union, Labor was put on
the bulletin boards. Many did not believe
the news "at; the time, for nearly every
one was' talking; Partridge shortly before.
But when rival :papers flashed their bulle
tins thirty | minutes later the multitude
looked around, and as each one had heard
the news half an hour before It occa
sioned no unusual ; surprise. .; '. \ . \u25a0 ." t \-.
Many were interested' ; in the outcome
Â©f the big- election in New York, and as
usual. The Call was the first paper to
give out the fihal'resuH. At 8:41) the, bul
letin in front oÂ£: the, big buUding told^thp
waiting thousands thfct: McClellan would
rule as Mayor of the great metropolis, for
another term.; Some of course were skep
tical^ but the majority believed what they
had read, and they; were aU cheering, for
The Call's service when'- the other, papers
came , out half an hour -later .'with-, the
same . naws." t . ] Â» 1- : \u25a0"\u25a0 r-\u25a0 â¢'
All the Union LaW party men were
anxious to get a line on ; how ; full
ticket would ryn, and they got what they
were looking for at 6:15 when The Call
flashed a bulletin saying that the full
labor ticket had been elected beyond the
question of a, doubt. This news was an
nounced'- Just fifteen minutes before the
other two papers had the information,
and It drew mote crowds in front of the
bis building.
â¢ AU nigh: long The Call kept handing
out the news from five minutes to hair
an hour ahead of Its contemporaries.
The bulletlir system maintained by The
Call was perfect in every respect. At
620 The Call had the ' completa returns
from 175 out of 198 precincts and managed
to' give a correct forecast in the last few,
so that people who were, reading, these
bulletins managed to go home and- get
their suppers and wake up in the morn
ing Just as wise as their neighbors who
were forced to wait and watch around the
town till a late : hour - till ', they ! were en
abled to get,the final result, \u25a0
xThe police \u25a0 had- a hard task in front <of
The Call building. The [ crowd began to
congregate early :in 'the , afternoon^ and
atayed * till iU ' was satisfied that it knew
the result of the ' Important contest. The
Call's" bulletins were so perfect that those
who were watching them did not experj
ence a dull moment, for, there waa some
thing new â¢on the big canvas , every min
ute?'and-when anything .important hap
pened it waÂ» flashed over the wires so
quickly that iio one was, kept waiting.

RE-ELECTED MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITT. REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR-ELECT I
OF MASSACHUSETTS AND DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE, WHOSE ELECTION AS- I
GOVERNOR OF OHIO IS CLAIMED BY HIS PARTY. , - I
"I was certain that the people would not
back up the attempt of the bosses to force
me from office. Coming as It does,
straight from the hands of the people, in
spite of the opposition of the bosses and
machines, my election is peculiarly grati
fying. The District Attorney's office will
go on for four years more under my di
rection, for the same system has pre
vailed for the past four years.
"Thare is nothing more to be said save
that it was a test of strength between
corrupt bosses on one side and an aroused
public opinion on the other. There is no
trifling with the people when they have
been roused, and my election is a lesson
that the bosses will not soon forget."
Mayor McClellan, upon learning that he
had been re-elected. Issued the following
statement:
"Tho result of the election shows me
more plainly than ever my duty ~o the
people. With God's help I will discharge
it to the best of my ability. I shall keep
every promise made before the election."
Mr! Ivins said early in the evening:
"I really have little to say excent that
I am the happiest candidate that you
ever saw."
The members of the law committee of
the Municipal Ownership League were In
conference early this morning and de
clared that legal demands â¢ be made to
day or to-morrow (Thursday) at the
latest, for a recount of the. entire voto
cast in New York City, j The Htfarst men
declare that t,he fraudulent voting
throughout the city was the most fla
grant that has ever been attempted in
this country. .
According to the Tribune, fraud
charges were made last night by sup
porters of Hearst and Jerome. . Den- j
nlte charges that official counts of
votes in the Sixth and Eighteenth As
sembly districts had been withheld
were made at Jerome's headquarters.
Assistant District Attorney Rand, with -!
several attaches of the District Attor
ney's office, went post-haste to the
Sixth and Eighteenth districts and
found that ballots that, had been count
ed at 6 o'clock had not been officially
reported. Assistant District Attorney
Dcnison was sent to police headquar
ters to get aid from Commissioner Mc-
Adoo. The Jerome men say that the
most flagrant frauds have been per
petrated to try to accomplish the de
feat of Jerome.
From Tammany Hall, . Charles P.
Murphy, shortly before 11 o'clock, sent
out word to every leader in the city
that the honor of the organization was
at stake and every .vote for McClellan
must be counted. He told them to
overlook nothing and spare no expense
in getting .the facts to Tammany as
early as possible.
"Count every Democratic vote and
turn in the report without a moment's
hesitation," the warning ran. "The
honor of Tammany Is at stake."
The county of New York, with forty
six election districts missing, gives:
Flarner 12,637, Osborne (D.) 104,193,
Sbearn (Municipal Ownership) 68,701,
Jerome (Independent) , 107,711. This
gives Jerome a plurality of 8525.
With three election districts missing
in Manhattan, the vote was: McClellan
118,442, Hearst 101.691 and Ivins 64,656,
Riving McClellan a plurality of 16,752.
In the borough of Brooklyn, with
fourteen election districts missing, Mc-
Clellan has 66,976, Hearst 82,906 and
Ivins E9.458 votes, a Hearst plurality of
15.988. In Queens, with four missing
districts, Hearst had a plurality, of 721

DEFEAT OF CHIEF MURPHY.
Power of the Leader of Tammany Hall
In Shaken.
; j NEW YORK. Nov. 7.â After a campaign
I unusual In its public interest and excite
! ment, Tammany Hall met defeat to-day;
' in its ,hard-f ought efforts to elect James'
| W. Osborne to the District " Attorneyship
; of New York County and saved the May
' ; oralty of the city by only a few. thousand
I votes. So close was the contest that up to
11 o'clock the result was not certain, but
at that time the indications "were that
George B. McClellan, Democrat, has been,
re-elected Mayor for a four years' term,
'and that William T: Jerome, Independ
ent, had been re-elected District Attorney.
j The exter.t to which the Tammany or
â¢ ganization was shaken may be judged
i from the fact that there was no fusion of
the opposition parties, the means by
which the organization had been com
bated heretofore, but that Jerome, run
ning as a candidate of no party and with
Â»hls record In office as his platform, suc
ceeded in overcoming the former prestige
of the Democratic organization, and Wil
liam R. Hearst, standing as the nominee
of tho Municipal Ownership League,' a
new factor in New York politics, came
within a j few thousand votes of being
elected Mayor. ,
At 11 o'clock, when about half the re
turns for New York County . were . in, it
appeared that Jerome had won by sev
eral thousand: " His \riumph was ' almost
entirely a personal oue, and showed, that
an appeal : may be made successfully * to
j voters on . the strength : of personal . hon
esty and persistent, systematic denun
ciation of graft and political bossism.
Mr. Jerome's campaign f was conducted
with a special opposition to Charles F.
Murphy, leader . of Tammany Hall, ana
his reputed wealth, and the result " prac-;
ticaliy is a defeat for Murphy . as w-ell as
for Osborne. : \u25a0 >- â¢
Up to 11 o'clock .Mr. Hearst? who car
ried the boroughs "of Brooklyn ; and
Queens, refused to concede " his ; i defeat,
and his -campaign mangers declared that
a contest would ~ be . made.l William M.
Ivins, the Republican; nominee, . " was
third in the, race for Mayor, and ran far,
behind Hearst." " \u25a0 . . ,
Bird S. Coler was' elected â¢ Borough

Ownership ticket, and Hearst 'carried,

Democrat, for Governor, had a plurality
of 3425 over Herrick, Republican.
! The Republican leaders concede : that
i with the possible exception of Alexander
Handen, Republican, l for | Judge,
the Democrats have . made a clean sweep
of all city and county candidates. The
Leader, Independent f Republican, says
that-Torn .Johnson, Democrat, for Mayor,
will have a plurality of 12,000.
COLUMBUS, Nov. 7.â At 11 , o'clock to
night the result of the election in Ohio
might still be considered in doubt, al
though the Democratic leaders claimed
the election -of Pattison and the entire
Democratic ticket by substantial plurali
ties, while the Republicans simply refused
to concede ; such a claim, Insisting that
the returns were insufficient at that hour
to indicate anything except that the vote
had been very heavy and that the amount
of- scratching had ; ; , made', counting very
slow. In the ; cities the Republican loss
exceeded 100 to* the precinct, but as the
loss outside of the large '\u25a0\u25a0 cities was, so
far a* reported, only about 33 per cent.
>there was no certainty, that it would run
high" enough to ' wipe, out the 230,000 Re
publican plurality: with, which com
parisons were made. Less than 300 of the
4200 precincts in the State had been heard
from, at 11 o'clock.
It has been expected that In view of the
bitter fight that .was ; made on Governor
Herrick ". personally he-- would â¢ run
behind his ticket, but up to midnight he
was running, two votes to the precinct
ahead of Colonel Harris, the Republican
candidate for . Lieutenant Governor, who
was expected to poll the average party
vote. If this is continued throughout the
vote" would indicate that, the bitterness
of the attacks on Herrick had apparently
reacted in his favor and gained him votes
instead of losing them. The early reports,
though very meager, were so strongly in
favor of Pattison that his election was
bulletined and announced in many of the
extras, but; as fuller returns came in.
shoving reduced ratio of gains, the Re
publicans "became more hopeful and the
Democrats refused to give. out any state
ments, although they still maintained ;
that they had gained a notable victory.
Early in the night reports? from Cin
cinnati were to the effect. that Hamilton
County, which had been counted on by :
the Republicans to' give 20,000 plurality j
for Herrick, had gone for Pattison, but j
at midnight .a private message from J
George 8. . Cox to Governor Herrick an- :
nounced that Hamilton County had given i
the : Governor 3500 plurality. The 8000. or j
more given by Cuyahoga Court ty for Pat- I

PHILADELPHIA RESCUED
FROM RULE OF BOSSES
REFORMERS CARRY CITY
Democratic Candidate for State
Treasurer Is Elected.
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 7.â Philadelphia
has been swept by the reform movement,
the City Party ticket winning by a sur
prisingly large plurality.
While returns from only six of the for
ty-two wards in thfs city had been count
ed up to midnight,' enough Is known of
the result in the remaining wards to in
dicate th*e defeat of the Republican local
ticket by from 60,000 to 75.000 plurality;
The victory of the City Party carries
with it the election of William H. Berry,
the Democratic and Reform nominee for
State Treasurer. J. Lee Plummer. the Re
publican candidate for that office, was
badly cut throughout the city and State
and he has lost his own county, which. is
usually Republican.
The result has every appearance of a
landslide foe reform, not only In Phila
delphia but^throughout the State.
. The returns up to midnight show that
the ReoubTlcans carried only a few wards,
and these were won by narrow margins.
One year ago President Roosevelt car
ried the city by 150.834 plurality.
\u25a0 None of the Republican leaders had
much to say on the result. Sheriff James
1 L. Miles, chairman of the Republican
City Committee, would not admit defeat
until midnight. Asked for a statement,
he said:
"I have nothing to say; what's the
use?"
The City party sympathizers were cele
brating their victory to-night by parad
ing the streets. As soon as the result
was definitely known hundreds of them
formed in line and' marched down Chest
nut street. An unusual turnout was that
of the campaign committee of the City
party, which is made up of some of the
wealthiest and most influential people In
the city i They marched behind a band
to the. tune "Onward. Christian Soldlers t "
Contrary to general expectation there
was no very serious disturbance in tne
city to-day. . There were, however, many
f mull scrimmages at I polling places, es
pecially In the more thickly settled wards,
where the Republican organization. i 3
very strong and where the City party put
up a "determined fight. The Police De
partment was at all times master. of the
situation, and wherever trouble was
started it was quickly stopped. Some of
these disturbances blossomed into small
rallies, but after the smoke had cleared
away It was found /that no one was se
riously wounded. ]

ward, the Eighth, which gave more
that 4000 Republican majority last
year, was carried by the City. party by

City Party Chairman Edmons to
night sent the following telegram to j
President Roosevelt:
"Philadelphia has risen to its oppor
tunity and stands redeemed. The prin
ciple" of honesty in government so fre
quently espoused by you has won an
overwhelming triumph. Our majority
approximates 73,000."
To Secretary Root the following was
sent:
"The masauerade Is over. T^ia crimi
nal and corrupt combination has been
driven from power by the righteous In
dignation of a great Republican city.
"We have only begun. Our thanks to
you for your splendid aid."
At 10 p. m. the City party headquar
ters sent the following: telegram to
Governor Folk of Missouri:
"We have swept the city by 60.009
majority."
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 7.â lncomplete
returns from various parts of the State
indicate the election of Berry (D.) foe
State Treasurer by a large plurality. Re
publican strongholds are showing unex
pected gains for Berry. Lancaster Coun
ty, normally Republican by 10.000. Is In
doubt. Dauphin County. In which Har
risbursr. the State Capital. Is located, an
other Republican, stronghold, gives Berry
1500 plurality. Other Republican counties
show the same enormous Republican
losses. ; ,- *
Berry, nominated as a Democrat, was
indorsed by the Independent Republicans
and the Prohibitionists. In this city the
Lincoln party, formed by the Independ
ents, gave Berry a tremendous vote.
Tne State Treasury has been under Re
publican control since ISSO. Roosevelt's
plurality last year was 504.000. .. \u0084 \u25a0
State Treasurer was the only ofSce for
which there was a contest at to-day'a
election. Judge John Stewart, an ap
pointee of Governor Pennypacker, was
re-elected Associate Justice of the Su
preme CourtÂ»for the full term of twenty
one years. Presiding Judge Charles E.
Rice and Judges George B. Orlady and
James A. Beaver of the Superior Court
were elected for a term of ten years.
John B. Head (D.) also was elected s>
Superior Court Judge to succeed Judga
Peter P. Smith, the minority member of
that body, who failed of re nomination.
Under the law no elector Is entitled to
vote for more than three candidates for
Judge of the Superior Court, of which
fouV are to be elected, as was the case
this year. Head was the only Demo
cratic nominee for this office, which prac
tically made his nomination equivalent to
an election. Homer L. Castle. . who was
brought into prominence by his attacks
on the State Treasury management fol
lowing the developments In the Enter
prise Bank affair, was the Prohibition
nominee for Superior Court Judge.
Public interest centered In the contest
for State Treasurer, for which the prin
cipal candidates were J. Lee Plummer.
nominee of the Republican and Citi
zens* parties, and William Berry, tho
candidate of the Democratic. Prohibition.
Lincoln and Independent parties. Berry
also was the choice of the city party
leaders of Philadelphia.
Judge Stewart was appointed by tho-
Governor to succeed the late Judge Dean
early last summer, and was afterward
nominated by the Republican State Com
mittee for the full term. He was subse
quently nominated by the Democratic.
Prohibition and all other political parties
in Pennsylvania, with the exception of
the Socialist and Socialist Labor parties,
which had full tickets in the field for all

FOR ALFONSO
L'eport Has It That He Is to
3larrv Duchess 3larie of
Mecklenburg - Schwerin
SIGNIFICANT ALLIANCE
'Would Connect the King of
Spain With Half Riding
Families of the Continent
EpeclÂ«.l Dispatch to Tbe Call.
BERLIN, Nov. 7.â The Duchess Marie
Antoinette of Mecklenburg-Schwerin ar
rived in Berlin to-day. It Is understood
that her engagement to King Alfonso will
soon be announced. The Duchess is a
â¢ Catholic. She was born at Venice in 18S4
and Is nearly two years older than the
Spanish King. She is the only daughter
of Duke Frederick of Mecklenburg-
Schwerin, uncle of the reigning "Grand
Duke. She is a cousin of the Duchess
Cecilia, who recently married the Ger
man Crown Prince. Another of her cous
ins Is married to Prince Christian of Den
mark, and her aunt, the Duchess Marie,
is married to the Grand Duke Vladimir of
Russia,
It is said that King Alfonso desired to
niarry an English Princess, and it was
recently persistently reported that an en^
gagement between him and a daughter of
the Duke of Connaught had been ar
ranged. Apparently come- obstacle, state
or personal, interfered with this plan. .
If the King marries the Duchess Marie
the political results of the union will be
almost as satisfactory to Spain as if he
had married a member of the British
j-oyal house, for she Is closely related to
half the ruling families of the continent.
BERLIN. Nov. 7âThe Jisit of King
Alfonso to Berlin is regarded as being
without political significance. He re
ceived Chancellor yon Bulow in audience
to-day, later hold a reception of the dip
lomatic corps and then witnessed the
cscearlng in of the recruits.
MADGEBURG, Prussia. Nov. 7.â The
f.olltical police arrested three men here
yesterday before King Alfonso arrived,
who seemed to show undue Interest In
the King's mo\"etnents. The men as
serted that they were Ecuadoreans on
their way to Berlin to study.
"I return over half the things I find to
the losers, chasing them after they drop
them. If I fail to catch them I watch
for their ads in the papers. I made up
my mind from the first never to keep
anything- -If I could find the owner. I
have been tempted, but to be dishonest
would spoil the game for me.

Its Complexion Will Not Be

BALTIMORE, Nov. 7.â The election
â¢In 1 Maryland to-day was for a State
Cpmptroller, Legislature and county
officers, and "in Baltimore for a Judge
of the Supreme . Court, Sheriff, City
Clerk and Surveyor. The Issue which
engrossed popular attention was a
proposed constitutional amendment, the
avowed purpose of which was the dis
franchisement of the negro voters, but
which aroused widespread opposition
among many Democrats and foreign
born voters i:i both parties. Owing to
the extreme length of the ballot the
count has been slow, and at a late hour
to-night the votes In some of the city
precincts and remote country districts
have not been counted. The returns so
far received, however, make certain the
defeat of the proposed constitutional
amendment by a decisive majority of
Â£0.000 or more, and very probably the
election of 'McCullough (Republican),
State Comptroller, over Atkinson
(Democrat), and the election of Repub
licans in three out of four of the city
legislative districts.
The Republican candidates for Sher
iff, City. Court^Clerk and City Surveyor
in Baltimore are elected.
Chief Jud;?e Harlan (Democrat) Is
re-elected by 10,000 majority. The
Republicans did not' nominate a can
didate against Judge Harlan, though
there was an independent Republican
candidate. ,

Senator Is to Be Chosen
TRENTON, NV'J., Nov. 7.â The elec
tion In New Jersey Increased the Re
publican hold on- the State Legislature
and makes it impossible that a Demo
crat should succeed United States Sen
ator John F. Dryden in 1907. In ,the
State Senate the Republicans made a
pain of three,' electing Republicans from
Gloucester," Salem and Somerset coun
ties, which for the last three years have
had Democratic Senators.
,' Colby, the Independent Republican In
Essex County, whose fight against the
machine of . his party attracted wide
spread Interest, was swept Into office
by a majority which approached that
which this j county gave a . year ago,,
when the local, ticket had the help of
the national ticket to carry it along.
At a late hour it looks as if Colby. had
won by not less than 19,000, and * his
majority may go over that. He carried
his ticket through with him.
The Republican wave swept into Jer
sey-City pgain. and Mayor Fagan, who
is an Independent Republican of the
Colby stripe, was again elected, and
carried his ticket through with him.

Less than a month ago, when Hearst
accepted the nomination^ of the Municipal
Ownership League, McClellan's re-elec
tion was regarded as a certainty, and the
Mayor himself declared that he Intended
to make only a few speeches. With the
sudden outburst of enthusiasm for Hearst,
however, the situation' changed so swiftly
that the Democratic leaders were startled
from the repose of their quiet confidence
to # engage in one of their hardest fights.
Hearst wound- up his campaign Sunday
night at Madison Square Garden with the
Garden crowded to the doors and tens of
thousands.. of men standing outside for

The weather of to-day was ideal, adding
greatly to the polling of a, large \ vote.
There was little disorder, and although
many arrests; were made. they frequently
were ttue. to a misunderstanding or- lo
clerical errors, and only a few men -were
held for trial. More splitting of tickets
was done probably than ever before, r yet
the voting was unusually rapid.. An inci
dent of the day was the desertion of sev
eral hundred of Hearst's poll watchers,
â¢who went over ' to the opposition, i '"
A great demonstration greeted Jerome
when the fact' that he was' elected was
placed 'beyond all question. A throng of
men and women filled the lobby at the
District Attorney's headquarters, cheer
ing, and waving flags and handkerchiefs
and calling for a speech.- In response Je
rome said.' "Â» v '"' .r.
"I would be glad to express my. heart-,

trusted me and I will serve you as faith

; CHICAGO, Nov." 7.â The Republican^
made a clean sweep of the election in
Chicago and Cook County, to-day, elect^
ing all of their candidates with the ex

crat to reach the promised land was

between McCormick, the Republican
candidate, and Wenter, the Democratic
nominee. McCormick waa successful
by about 4000 and Wenter failed to
gain a position as a member of the
board by at least 1000 votes. The race
between Webb, the high man on the
Democratic ticket, and Baker, .the low
man on the Republican. ticket, was. very
close, with the chances jin . favor â¢of
Webb, although at midnight Baker was
conceded to have a fighting chance.

The mailboat brought no news of Mrs.

ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 7.â Count de
Wltte has definitely pledged himself to
support the plan for the convocation of
a constituent assembly when the Douma
meets if a single representative raises the
question. He is exceedingly anxious to^
Trtn the support of the Zemstvoists, who,*
he dees not hesitate to declare, conform
nearest to his political ideas and which ,
he evidently regards as the strongest, j
tafest and most Influential factor in the i
future political life of the country. The
Count has been in almost constant con
sultation with the leaders of this party,
but they have steadily refused their al
â¢letfanc* except on the condition of the j
convocation of a constituent- assembly >
based on universal suÂ£rrage.
Count de Witte has persistently opposed
the' demand, insisting: that the matter was
for the Douma itself to decide. At the
earne time he announced his personal be
lief that in the end such an assembly
must be summoned. Finally, in the course
of a long conversation with Petrunke
vitch, a member of thtj Moscow Zemstvo
i and president of the Moscow Agricultural
k Society, the Count said:
"I gi* - e you my word of honor if when
the Douma meets one representative de
mands a constituent assembly I will sup
port him."
DE AVITTE XOT SUPPORTED.
Count de Witte continues to complain
bitterly of the lack of confidence toward
him by all the elements of :he opposi
tion ai a time when he stands so much
In need of the" support oi the Liberals. He
said to M. Petrunkevitch:
."I find myself confronted by a mighty
ocean and with only a cockleshell on the
eiiore. You say this boat will carry me
across to the other shore, and I enter it
because there is no other craft in sight."
The Count added that he believed "if
Christ himself were at the head of the
Government, the opposition would not be
lieve in him," and said that at the present
Juncture the only person who was second
ins: his endeavor to introduce the new re
gime in a completely loyal spirit was Gen
eral* T report.
The Slovo, which now styles Itself the
"advocate of the party of order, " Is
earnestly appealing to the Liberals to
hold up the hands of Count de Witte, de- I
elaring It is time for the forces of de- |
etruttion to cease and to Join in the world j
of construction. It argues that if so
ciety should back the propaganda of the
Social Democratic party, which repre
sents the ideals and interests of 4,000,000
\u25a0workmen, it would be equivalent to cre
ating an oligarchy over 140,000,00-} people,
numerically larger it is true than the
present oligarchy, but no less dangerous
to the future of Russia.

THE UPPER PICTURE IS OF THE FAMOUS POLISH NOVELIST , WHO AD
DRESSED MOBS IN HIS NATIVE COUNTRY YESTERDAY. THE LOWER
CUT IS OF A POSSIBLE MEMBER OF DE WITTE 1 S CABINET.
The project for a sweeping extension of
the suffrage in elections to the national
assembly, promised by the Emperor, is
published.
After the first days of confusion and
doubt following the issuance of the mani
festo giving a constitution to Russia and
nominating Count de Witte Premier, the
latter's new Government appears to -be
getting fairly under way.
1 The Cabinet with which Count de Wifte
j will undertake the difficult task of guid
i ing the nation on its new course of con
stitutionalism and preventing the radical
and agitatory elements from driving it
on the rocks of revolution, is now begin
ning to take form. The names of the two
Shipoffs, one of them ivan, having been
Count de Witte's former assistant Jn the
Ministry and his associate at Ports
mouth. N. H., and the other, Dmitri, the
Moscow Z'emstvolst, who was president
of the first Zemstvo Congress, are seml
authoritatively announced as his selec
tions respectively for Minister of Fin
ance and , Comptroller General. M. Ne
mechaieff, president of the Southeastern
Railroad, who, as the press is Informed,
is recommended by the railroad men to
succeed Prince Rilkoff, is now on his way
to St. Petersburg to consider the tender
of the portfolio of Ways and Communi
cations.
With the nomination of Prince Alexis
Obolensky as Procurator General of the
Holy Synod, already gazetted, this pro
vides four of the eight Ministerial posts
at the disposition of the Premier.
Prince Urusoff, until recently Governor
of Tver, may alsa be elected to a Cabinet
position, yet undetermined. For the two
portfolios, for education and justice, Count
de Witte has been disappointed in. ob
taining the men he originally desired, but
he has other possible Cabinet timber in
view for those posts.
BASIS Ol' REPRESENTATION.
Though Dmitri Shipoff is no longer in
sympathy with' the Zemstvo. majority,
which, in the interval of the first and
second congresses progressed so far be
yond his pan-Slavist ideas that he failed
to secure election as a member of the
bureau, he will rally to the support of the
new Cabinet a strong faction of conserv
ative Zemstvoists. who are alsd follow
ers of pan-Slavism whose doctrine is the
development of a- new Government on
Russian lines. They believe the West
European and American models are not
suited to the Slav people.
Dmitri Shipoft is a man of sound, con
servative ideas, who, like the late Prince
Troubetskoy, dared to make a stand
against the sweeping* current which car
ried away most of the Zemstvoists. . The
selection of M. Nemechalcff is apparently
good. He is a practical man of smairs,"
who has had long experience in railroad
administration and as shown by the rec
ommendation of the railroad delegation
has the sympathy of the workmen.
The former Ministers, except four, who
are not subject to the jurisdiction of the
Premier, are slated . for dismissal. / .
Count de Witte is not submitting much
of his new programme to the old . com
mittee of Ministers.
The new measure grants representation
to the workmen . on the same basis as
peasants, one representative "for each
250.000, and extends the suffrage to the
great class of "intellectuals" possessing
college degrees, who have been the heart
and soul of the reform movement. Vot

GRAND DUKE IXMXE/
Grand Duke Nicholas Michaelievitch is
the only member of the imperial family
backing, Count de Witte. He went to Pe
terhof at the latter's suggestion during
the critical time Just before the Issuance
of the manifesto of October- 30 while
Count Alexis Ignatleff, a member
of the council of the; Emperor, and; Mr.
j Goremykin, former Minister of - the In
terior, were struggling to prevent- any
yielding, to the popular demands. The.
Grand Duke never ceased to' exercise his
influence in favor of Count de Witte.
When the Count on the Sunday preced
ing the issuance of the manifesto left
Peterhof in disgust, the Grand Duke in
duced the Emperor, "to reconsider his de
cision and to dispatch General* Baron W.
Fredericks, Minister of the 1 Imperial
House, in an automobile to St. Petersburg
at 2 o'clock in the-morning to again sum
mon Count de Witte." who on the;memor
able Monday returned to Peterhof and
secured the Emperor's signature to the
historic document.
Some of Count de Witte's enemies are
now spreading a report that he was
bribed by the Jews.
The Russ, which Is conducting a cam
paign for the downfall of General TrcpoJT,
declares that unless the' general be im
mediately' removed the country will suc
cumb to military.. dictatorship.
WILL, CHANGE CALENDAR.
The newiera in Russia .will; be marked
by a change in the Julian Gregorian cal
endar. The use of the old calendar,
which is thirteen days behind that of the
other civilized ; countries/ has been; the
cause of indefinite confusion;; The Acad
emy of Sciences has already submitted
a plan to shorten the Russian February
by thirteen days and ,to; begin ! March^ 1
in the new style.
Now that the crisis in Finland is vir
tually over, it appears ;that. the revolu
tlonai-y Socialists had complete control
of the situation. \u25a0 The rrfilitary In pos

BERLIN". . Nov. 7.â William T. Stead,
fresh from Russia, stopped over, in Berlin
to-day. on his way to Paris. .For, an hour
\u25a0 and 'a half ho poured forth his vivid im
! pressions of _*;hell pretty well let-loose,"
; as he called it, of the things ,ha, had seen
and heard and of^Lhe "ghastly Suiter into
which Russian ' society had drifted." M
"Strange things are' happening," said
Stead. "Think of the Incidents at Reval.
Some determined persons marched down
the street to the . town hall, ' followed by
a. crowd. There the Mayor ; and ? council-'
tnen were . sitting,- deliberating on the
situation. In -came â¢ our determined
friends. l'/'-" - ' ; :
" .'We demand, they said, .'we demand
liberty, universal' suffrage and the right
to rule ourselves.' '
" 'But,' said the; Mayor, 'I cannot give
you these things. 'I would gladly send
your petition to the Emperor.'
" 'Well.' continued- the delegates, 'we!
are delegates of : a revolution . and . if {we
do not get what jwe â¢ want we have de
cided to'burn -the city. Give us 7500
rubles.' , ; â¢ ,
"The Mayor and his colleagues thought
It was better to pay the 7500 rubles! than
to have the city burned,: so -they raised
the money, - paid- the .delegates, and the
latter went away, promising to be very
good,' and they, were y good. But another
crowd came j and'said :
" 'What about^us? Pay us, too.'
â¢ "This the Mayor : would not do, antj

WOMANr AT THE HEAD.
"The 'Red Virgin'^ of the French com
mune was Louise Michel. Well, in Reval
a I certain widow, named Llntle, dressed
in scarlet from top to-*toe and with an
ax over: her shoulder, placed herself at
the head, of the mob. ;All; A11 night the revo

order the troops to fire. â¢ Five ; minutes
went by and the widow : Llnde, in red,
climbed v 'lamp post - and cried fout -en :

OAKLAND, Xov. 7.â Manuel d'Avilla,
the three-year-old son of John d'AvWa,
a larmer living in the hills -About a mile
and & half from Mission San Jose, was
burned to death yesterday at 3 p. m. In
a fire which destroyed a large barn on
the D'AvHla ranch. The two other chil
dren, a brother and sister of the un
fortunate child, narrowly escaped the
same fat*
Accord!^ to the story told by the
grief-etricken parent* of the child the
three children were playing with matches
in the "barn and eet Â£re to the hay. A
sudden chorus of shrieks attracted the
attention of the mother to the children,
and she started for the barn to Investi
gate. Just aa she reached the door little
Manuel rushed from the structure, with
his clothins a mass of flames, and fell
to the ground, writhing in ayony. The
mother tried frantically to extinguish the
fire in the clothlne of her son and was
severely burned on the hands and arms,
but before she succeeded in tearing away
the burning garments the child was
fatally burned.
The" other children who were in the
barn when the fire started were nearer
the door than their brother and escaped
uninjured.
The* accident happened at 3 p: m., and
D'Avilla at once started for Mission San
Jose to eecure the services of a doctor.
The child had been so badly" burned,
however, that there was no hope of
caving his life, and death ended his
agony at b o'clock. Drs. Lee and Emer
son attended the child, but from the
first the ease was hopeless.
The case was reported to the Coroner
this morning, and an inquest will be
held Sunday, at 9:30 a. m., to determine
where the responsibility for the death
Of the child lies.

JAPAN'S FOOD
RATION IS GOOD
Professor Jaffa Says They bat on
;v; v uvVery Rational Basis.
RICE NOT THEIR EXCLUSIVE DIET
BERKELEY. Xov. 7.â The tradition
thut Japanese fiffhters on sea and land
accomplish their wonders on a diet of
rice, or a diet popularly referred to aÂ»
a. -'vegetable diet," was given a series
of smashes by Professor M. E. Jaffa, the
famous food expert associated with the
staff of the agricultural college at the
Cniveralty of California, In an important
address delivered to-night before the
Sigma XI society at the faculty club
house on the campus.
In a carefully prepared paper Professor
Jaffa dealt with the extraordinary re
sults achieved by the Japanese nation in
both war and Industrial fields, and
ehowea how the Japanese Government,
by takintr advantage of the very latest
phases of scientific nutrition experiments,
had provided a ration for the army and
navy, on the strength of which the
"little brown men" are enabled to do
marvelous feats, both in the way of ag
gressive movement and In the way of
endurance.
It has been generally known, said Pro
fessor Jaffa, that the Japanese people
were prepared for war with modern
armaments and modern Instructors in
army and navy; but not, perhaps, so gen
erally known that the Mikado's people
had put their army and navy on a su
perior footing to the Russians and per
haps to European 'fighting forces, by
taking advantage of scientific work in
the field of nutrition experiments, so that
they were fed most scientifically while
they fought and marched and sailed the
seas in battle.
A Government bulletin of extraordinary
interest, compiled by Professor Oshima,
a Japanese scientist who worked with
Professor Jaffa at Middletown, Conn.,
three years ago, when both were on a
vacation from regular university work,
waÂ» In part the basis of Professor Jaffa's
address to-night Professor Oshima
studied the problem of nutrition in
America and at Middletown co-operated
with Professor Atwater, whose home Is
at Middletown. but whose official title is
that of Chief of Nutrition Investigations
of the Department of Agriculture at
Washington.
Professor Oshima's bulletin deals with
the progress the Japanese people have
made in adapting their army and navy
men to such changes In diet as they
have found comported best with, the re
sults of nutrition experiments. The food
of the common people and its effects
upon the energies of the Japanese are dis
cussed by the Japanese writer, the entire
bulletin being a valuable contribution
to the literature- which students of
Japan's secret and seemingly miraculous
workings are now studying all over the
world. v -'
Incidentally, Professor Jaffa, who is
thoroughly familiar as a food expert,
with this Japanese division of the field,
informed his hearers to-night that one
beloved idea of the vegetarian advocates,
which Is supposed to have its foundation
In the strength of the famous jlnriklsha
men of Japan, must be laid on' the shelf.
These jinriklsha men are marvelously
strong. They are supposed to subsist on
a diet of rice. Travelers who see the
men run for many miles, eating nothing,
apparently, but a little rice, exploit this
phase of Japanese life, and rice has ac
cordingly been acclaimed as a supremely
fine food. Â»
KXOCKS OUT TRADITION.
Professor Oshima has knocked this
pretty tradition out. and Professor Jaffa
to-night gave it another body blow when
he proved that the Jlnriklsha men eat,
besides rice, enough energy-producing
food to put them in a class along with
the best-fed mechanics of Sweden, ath
letes of New England and other husky
citizens. He cited Professor Oshima's
table to prove that the Jlnrikisha men eat
energy-producing fooi, vegetable, fish and
meat of sufficient fuel value to entirely
discount the theory that their feats of
strength are done on a diet of rice.
Professor Jaffa spoke to-night In part
as follows:
The talk this evening: !\u25a0 partly for the
purpose of correcting the popular fallacy on
th* subject of the dietaries of the Orient. Per
haps there is no oue remark -which one hears
repeated more often than the one which states
that the Chinese and Japanese live almost ex
clusively on rlct. My own enlightenment com
menced about five years agro, when I was led
to make tome studies on the Chinese dietaries.
I was *omewhat surprised to find that they
lived more In accordance -with ' the tentative
standard set down by noted nutrition investi
gators than do & Rood many Americans under
like conditions of work; and also It waÂ» found
that their dlÂ«t is very much varied. It is true
that they eat a Urge quantity of rice, but
when one considers that it takes the place in
large part of the potatoes, bread, mush . and
similar food used by the Westerners, the qual
ity la not excessive.
LEARNS VALUABLE FACTS.
While in the East about two years ago I
met Professor Oehlma, who, like myself, was
employing his sabbatical year In making nu
trition Investigations. He related many In
teresting facts about the diet of the Japanese,
which corroborated Our observations and con
clusions with reference to the. Chinese. This in
terest wa* revived upon my receiving recently
his report to the United States Government
on the subject. ,
His report Is a comprehensive summary of
nutrition investigations I mad* in Japan . since
ISS2, the first year when scientific investiga
tion* alcng this line was. made. Professor
Oshima shows that wherever. the mixed died
was u*ed in Japan it was where It could be
afforded and that the pure vegetable diet was
1 merely ono of necessity. Induced by poverty or
location. When they had the choice and could
afford It they used the mixed diet. The- work
contains analyses from various sources of about
800 samples of I Japanese , food ' materials.
The Japanese eat. like the Americans, ; three
meals a day, although In the rural (districts It
Is not uncommon to find four or five meals con
sumed. The meals, however, are generally
similar in character. . . .
In summarizing the studies of â¢ the Japanese
dietaries and comparing them with the average
of 185 American dietaries . Professor Oshima
points out that the diet Is ' amply sufficient, ;
both as regards protein and energy, for the
needs ofthe Japanese. . .
These ' ctudles of Japanese diet are fairly
representative of the diet of -the Japanese peo
ple, although, of* course, they : do not consider
the diet Of the very poor,, nor: of the â¢richest,
any more than our experiments here in Amer
ica would take in the lowest : or poorest . class,
or the very richest. . ; . *
With reference to. the army ration,, about
which so much has been satd and written,
Professor Oahlma. has some Interesting* data. ',
A rather startling feature , is this Japanese
expert's apparent admission that the 'Japan- i
ese soldiers do not do as much work as - their
opponents, the Russians. Says the professor:. '
' "A" common American dietary standard for ',
a man at- light to moderate muscular work
calls for 103 grams digestible protein and 8050
eateries of energy. Similar values for a man
at moderately active muscular; work are 113
Krams Z protein and 3400 calories of energy. \
Commonly accepted â¢ European ' dietary stand
ard* are somewhat like these. ; 'i<ES#HS|
VTnkinir - into f account â¢ both the work done
end the weifrht of the soldiers, which Is on an
average undoubtedly lew than that Â« Of : the
United- States ; or . European troops. It" will, be
teen that the army ration is adequate, both as
regard? " protein and energy. * and * that : it has
evidently. been fixed upon with a view to meet
ing : the requirements of commonly accepted
dietary standards."."; \u0084 \u25a0"\u25a0" â¢â¢â¢*. ; \u25a0.. \u25a0'.- ,

SUGGESTS CHANGE
IN HANDLING COIN
Oakland Mayor Says, City
Money Should Be Kept
in Circulation.
OAKLAND. Nov. 7.â Mayor Â« Mott has
called the attention of the City Council
to what he considers the "unbusiness
like methods" of handling the city's
funds. He states that under a recent act
of the Legislature the .question of de
positing public moneys in savings banks
may be submitted to the people to vote on
a constitutional amendment. At present
the monoy is placed in safe deposit
vaults, whereas the Mayor : thinks ; It
should be kept in circulation, and he
suggests that a proper bond be furnished
by the banks to Insure the , city from
loss. H>, further suggests that the mat
ter be referred to a special committee,
and the finance committee of the Council
will consider his suggestions.
The Council has passed to print an
ordinance for the condemnation of "the
Willows," bounded by the- lake . shore.
Fourteenth and Oak streets, for park
purposes.
An ordinance granting a franchise to
the Oakland Traction Consolidated for a
franchise on East Fourteenth street, from
First to Twelfth avenues, has been passed
to print.
City Engineer Turner has been directed
to draw plans for improving the sewer
system of the city.. Tlje proposed im
provement will cost $300)000, which it is
proposed to raise by a bond election.
Despite a vigorous protest a license to
conduct a saloon at .Tenth and Clay
streets has been granted to W. B. Quig
ley Jr.
A suggestion of Mayor Mott that there
were not sufficient water mains east of
Alice street and south of , Third street,
a manufacturing district, was referred
to the fire and water committee.'

Mystery of DylnÂ« Pearls.
A pearl necklace from the collection ot
M. Thlers. which Is now at tha Louvra
and which" was originally worth $100,000,
is "dyldg" and gradually losing Its value.
A London expert says that pearls- wane^
at times, but that Is' frequently causeer
I by their being kept in tha dark. Many a
beautiful pearl neck'^cs has lost some
thing of Its luster while stored away in
the dark, but has regained Its value when
exposed to the light again. As a rule
pearls improve by wearing; but the action
of the skin of various. persons acts dlffer
| ently on them. One woman will greatly
i Increase the. luster and the value of her
I pearls by .wearing them, but others will
I take all the luster, out of them.
I Turquoises are a jewel particularly sus
ceptible ,to outside Influenced, and there,
have been many Instances of these being

Prominent Insurance Men to

James H. Hyde Will Also Bo
Called Upon to Help Throw
Light on the High Finance
Sptclal TAevitch to The C*lL
NEW YORK. Nov. 7.â When the legisla
tive Insurance Inquiry resumes Its ses
sions to-morrow John R. Hegoman will
probably be the principal witness of the
morning, unless the Armstrong commit
tee's counsel should change its present
plan, which Is to proceed with the In
quiry Into the affairs of the Metropolitan
Life Insurance Company.
Hughes, however, haa not finished with
thÂ« Mutual, and some of Its officers are
Ukdr to *>â¢ recalled to thÂ» witness stand.
Robert H. McCurdy la expected to ex
plain more fully the costliness of his
trawling expenses, and Mr. Simpson,
thÂ» assistant treasurer, is under promise
to profiucÂ© certain information concern
ing the company's relations "with the New
York Wharf and Warehouse Company
and the Washington Electric and Trac
tion Company deal.
Hughe* hereafter la likely to be less ln-
Culgent with witnesses than heretofore.
With many of them he has tolerated too
laaay digressions from his immediate line
of Questioning so long as the replies . of
the witness seemed relevant to the gen
eral purposes of the inquiry. The com
taittee. however, is seriously concerned
lest its time between now and January
be all too short for the proper comple
tion of its task. Hughes Intends, there
fore, to be as concise as possible in his
methods of examination, and to Insist
upon concise and pertinent answers to
the Questions asked.
Edward H. Harriman has been Eubpe
naed to testify in the Insurance inquiry,
and probably will go on the stand soon
after the testimony of several witnesses
concerning the Mutual Life's affairs has
been heard. It Is possible that James H.
Hyde will go on the stand before Harri
rnan Is called, so that the committee may
have Hyde's account of things to serve
as a basis for Questioning Harriman.
Harriman, it is said, will be asked what
rate ol Interest he paid on the large loans
that the Equitable in its former admin
istration carried for him. Another topic
on which light will be sought has to do
with the settlement of Governor Odell's
suit against the Mercantile Trust Com
pany on account of his United States
Ship Building losses.
LONDON. Nov. 5.â A well-attended meet

For at least three months I had to sit

SOX OF GOTHAM BANKER
James R. 'Branch Dies Two
Days Aiter the Eneouriter,
Brought On by a Quarrel
ANNAPOLIS, Md., Nov. 7.âMidship
man James R. Branch, son of James IL
Branch: of the Hanovqr Bank of New
York City, and secretary of the American
Bankers' Association, was so seriously In
jured In a flst; fight on Sunday with an
other midshipman \u25a0 that he died to-day.
Branch fought with Midshipman Minor
Merlweather Jr. of Lafayette. 111. The
flght took place by arrangement on Sun
day, night, and was a regular pitched bat
tle, with a ring and seconds. . ., It lasted
twenty-three rounds and ended when
Branch was knocked down and struck the
right side of his head against the floor.
It was not considered that the injuries
were very dangerous, but Monday morn
lnging Branch's condition was such that
it became necessary .to let his'condltion
be known to the authorities.- Young
Branch was taken to the hospital and an
operation was | determined upon. It was
performed last night by Surgeons Fin
ney of Baltimore and Kerr of Washing
ton, assisted by the Academy medical
staff. It was thought to be successful,
but a turn for the worse took place this
morning, and the patient died at 10
o'clock, not having regained conscious
ness.
Merlweather Is also In the hospital as a
result of the injuries he received in 'the
fight. The question of his accountability
on a charge of manslaughter has been
discussed. He is suffering with a sprained
wrist and a bruised face. , v
Both men had some reputation as ath-'
letes. Branch as a wrestler and Merl
weather as a football player. It Is under
stood the flght took place because Branch
had In the line of his duty reported Merl
weather for a breach of discipline. The
latter feels the matter most keenly. :
NATION TO FORTIFY
THE GREAT LAKES
Canadian Canals Would Per
mit Gunboats to Menace
American Cities.
WASHINGTON, Nov.* 7.â Plans are un
der consideration at the War Department
for fortifying Chicago and other ports on
the Great Lakes and St Lawrence River.
A system, of fortifications developed by
Major John T. Johnson, at one time sta
tioned at Chicago, is being considered.-
At present Canada has large commer
cial projects under development. A canal
from the Ottawa River to Lake Ontario
and another from Hamilton on Lake On
tario to Lake Huron, now under contem
plation, will, when completed, give Can
ada an outlet to the sea through Domin
ion territory. While these . canals are
proposed as aids to commerce "they, will
be of sufficient, depth to accommodate
gunboats. â¢> The ' necessity f or . fortifying
Chicago and other Lake cities to protect
them from attack- by water/is .recog
nized by War Department officials, and
it Is almost certain that the scheme of
defense under consideration will be per
fected and the fortifications constructed.

SAN JOSE, Nov. 7.â Eli Wright, the ex-

Wright is out of the United States and
well on his way to some f oreign'Â«land to

'As soon as the Emmons trial was un

country. At that time he was out on
$2500 cash bail furnished by ' Grove L.
Johnson. When the Emmons .trial ended
Wright: came back to San Jose and sold
his h<Â»ne ' on ; Delfhas avenue for $5000. He
paid off a $1500 mortgage on the place
at the Security State Bank and went to
San Francisco and : met "Attorney Johnson
and; paid 5 him: $2500 for ., the . bail he fur

he did not want to stick his bondsmen.

and Then Shot Herself
PORTLAND, Nov. 7.â A ' special dis
patch to the Evening Telegram from
Newberg-, Ore., reports the tragic death
at that place of Carl Hurford and his
wife, a bride of six weeks. Whether the
tragedy was a murder and suicide, or
double suicide, may never be known.
Hurford had been sick for several days.
To-day his wife visited the manufactory
where he was employed seeking informa
tion . as to whether \u25a0he would be re-em
ployed on regaining his health. She was
told # that her - husband's " position would
be saved for him, but seemed not to be
reassured and appeared very agitated. It
was noticed that she kept her hand under
her cape during the interview, as If hid-
Ing something. Shortly after she re
turned home a shot was fired and Mrs.
Hurford was heard calling for help. Two
neighbors responded.- but as they ap
proached the house a second and third
shot were heard. The body of Mrs. Hur
foi^T was found lying on the bed and her
husband's, body, with a gaping wound In
the forehead, lay on the floor. There are

Divisions.
Special IMspatch to ThÂ« Call.
DENVER. Nov. 7.â The route of tho
Western Pacific, the San Francisco ex
tension of the Rio Grande, has been offi
cially announced by Chief, Engineer
Bogue. Bogue has divided the route into
five divisions^ â Oakland to Sacramento.
Sacramento to Orovllle, In California;
Oroville to Deep Hole, Nev.: Deep Hole
to Elko and Elko to Salt Lake. ! The
plan. is to cross the Southern Pacific at
Elko,. Nev., Instead of at Winnemucca.
as at first proposed.
The Western Pacific parallels the South
ern Pacific almost the entire distance,
and It may cross the Great Salt Lake,
forming a cut-off similar \to the Luchi
cut-off of the Southern Pacific.
It Is understood that the California and
Oregon road is among several small ones
already purchased. This latter gives
right of way Into Reno.
The present route, as announced, skirts
Pyramid Lake and follows the Humboldt
River for some distance. It is said that
the grade will be less than the Southern
Pacific and that the crossing at Becfc
wlth Pass will be less than any other
railroad crossing the Sierras. Already
the Rio Grande has begun a change of
line near the 010 Garfleld beach. Salt
Lake, to fym a connection with the
Western Pacific.
two theories, one that the woman shot
her husband, then becoming frightened
called for help, after which she killed
herself. Another theory, however. Is
that the husband killed himself and that
his wife, after calling for help. In her
frenzy of fright and anguish, picked up
the revolver and sent a bullet crashing
through her own head. The revolver was
found by her side. No powder marks are
visible around the wound in the hus
band's forehead.

fPBLICXTION Omca .THIRD AND MARKET . STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
WEDNESDAY.. :..... .....1. ......... NOVEMBER 8, 1905
JOINED TO HER IDOLS.
IT is perhaps too early to discern and discuss the causes of tl.e
failure of the well-meant attempt to defeat Mayor Schmitz. for a
third term and to lift San Francisco out of the pit digged for her
by his two administrations. The Call was the first newspaper >n
the city to declare, timely and positively, that his defeat was im
possible in a three-cornered fight. He had been twice elected as a
minority candidate by a plurality in such a fight, and it was ob
vious that he could easily win again with three candidates in the field.
Our earliest conviction was that a citizens' movement, inde
pendent of existing party organizations, making a clear-cut issue
for law and order and decency, was the most .promising of success.
Such a movement would not have been at all entangled with past
politics and politicians, and past reputations and actions. But the
wisdom of the many overbore us in this plan of campaign, and we
cheerfully supported the plan which it adopted. That plan has
proved inefficient. The instruments selected to carry it out were
excellent. It is probable that no better choice than Mr. 'Partridge
could have been made to make such a fight. His course and con
duct were admirable. He has made for himself a reputation and es
tablished a character that will cause him to be heard from again.
But in the movement there were entanglements, necessary in
its very nature. These Avere made the most of, and their existence
caused thousands of voters either to hold aloof or support Mayor
Schmitz, declaring that it required another corrupt administration
to fully arouse the people. This class of voters simply invoke the
vigilance committee.
The tactics of Maym Schmitz's campaign were too keen for the
fusion committee. They required exploitation of the Citizens' Al
liance as the backer of the fusion ticket. The Alliince was not at ali
in that position; but continual harping caused man}' of the fusionists
to indulge in heated repudiation of the Alliance and a misrepresenta
tion of its principles and purpose. The cold fact was that four im
portant candidates of the Labor L T nion ticket were members of the
Citizens' Alliance, and not one fusion candidate belonged to that
organization. But the game was played so well that the campaign
committee would not even permit the Citizens' Alliance a public ex
pression in vindication of its position. It is easily possible that a
portion of the 17,000 members of the Alliance took on a spirit of in
difference under such circumstances.
â¢These tactics produced another effect that was influential in
the result. The lure was held out to the fusion committee that the
labor vote, properly courted, could be divided. The effort was made
to divide it. It is said that the Mayor's tacticians even went so far
as to have certain unions present in writing their pledge to support
the fusion ticket. This snare operated to take the edge off the real
issue, which was law and order and government for all, and not for
a class. It is needless to say that these pledges were not kept,
nor intended to be kept, but they did the work for which they *\vere
made. â¢
We do not desire to be ungracious, for we have, none but the
most amiable feeling for the gentlemen- who conducted the fusion
campaign. The weakness was in the method of the movement, and
in the failure to appreciate at its full strength the class solidarity
which the Mayor has nursed during his four years of power. It is
injurious and un-American, but lust for power and greed of pelf
do not take that into account.
*\Vhen class government is defeated in this city it will be by
accepting the issue and making a clear-cut fight, with no fraterniz
ing on the picket lines and no quarter asked or accepted. : The
Mayor's pretense that he had kept industrial peace in this city was
known to be false. During his two administrations there were riot
and murder on the streets in labor troubles, and these were only
suppressed by an appeal to the courts and not to the Mayor. What
he did was for a consideration â the support of powerful corpora
tions for his political ambitions. He did protect those corporations
against strike violence and did not scruple to use the police for
that purpose. But the individual citizen sought peace and protection,
and even the right of self-preservation, from him in vain, and got
them only from the courts. . Â«Â£
But it is over. For some inscrutable reason San Francisco is
sentenced to two years more of class government and graft. The
turn in the lane may be far off. but there is a turn.
BENEFITS OF HYPNOTISM.
USEFULNESS of hypnotism will no doubt long be seriously
retarded because of the fear of the uncanniness that is con
nected with it, its association in the mind with charlatans who
have pretended it was . something very occult, and, above all, the
â¢ danger of its misuse by immoral persons who possess the power and
â¢might be unscrupulous in taking advantage-ef it. A further confirma
tion of the fact that it has a high usefulness now and an intimation
of a big future of beneficent usefulness for the strange phenomenon
Â« # is given by Harold M. Hays of the College of Physicians and Sur
geons, New York City, in a paper written for the Popular Science
Monthly.
. He has traced the history, nature and use of it-down to the pres
ent time, analyzed it as having for its* main element the 'force of
â¢ suggestion given by one intelligence to another, and that suggestion
. acting by what seems a marvelous power of mind over matter. In
â¢â¢order to explain the proved capacity- of this suggestion he adopts
as a working theory that idea made popular by Hudson in his ex
.- position of the laws of psychic phenomena that we have two mindsâ
the objective or conscious mind, and the subjective or unconscious.
In regard to that theory he admits that no two, psychologists will
'.agree as to just what is meant by the subjective and tlie objective
" mind. This physician's theory of the subjective mind is that it is the
perfect mind wherein arc stored. up all the thoughts that have ever
come into it, there lying dormant, only to be reawakened when a
â¢ new set of associations brings them forth.
Having thus reduced it from the supernatural down to a place
where physicians can legitimately make use of it as a part of curative
equipment, he expresses a belief in the wonderful power of this sub
jective mind over the body. For instance, if he sticks a needle deep
into a Lady's arm and hypnotically bids the wound not, bleed, the
theory is that the woman's subjective mind is so much' nearer per
'feet in its control of the body than is the conscious, objective mind
of our waking condition that it can command the tiny capillaries
pierced by the needle point to contract and check the flow of blood:
Hays explains that the attempt has been made to. use hypnotism iri
, discriminately, but that, like every therapeutic agent, it-will in time
become restricted and only used in certain complaints. To show that
in this limited; way it can be used beneficially and powerfully- by
physicians he. gives remarkable examples: He thinks a good justifi
cation of its use is especially in those cases which competent physi
cians pronounce incurable by the ordinary means. y~
In his present paper he confines himself wholly to the use of
hypnotism for physical ailments, but closes with the assertion that
. the part which hypnotism plays in mentaland moral culture is vast.
Dr.. Hays' paper will act as a/ strong suggestion of a big future of
s usefulness for hypnotism. .

WOMAN'S PLACE
ANGELA MORGAN
ONE ; of the most encouraging signs
.'of 'tha times is the fact that club
.women are devoting themselves
\u25a0 , with greater 'zear to the advance
ment of the ' home .than to any other
cause. N *
The woman. of to-day is at last begin
ning to see that within the limits of the
despised four walls which she so long re
garded as prison bars, are centered the
real forces that rule the "world without
She perceives at last that all real re
forms have their roots in the home,* that
to educate the mother, train the child,
improve the home, Is to ultimately purify
and elevate the community, the State." the
nation." .*
\u25a0 And now the question of paramount im
portance is how ; to better the home;, how
to educate the mother; how to train the
child who la the future politician, states
man and leader of men^ It is to the solv
ing ;of this problem that women hereto
fore engaged chiefly in political reforms
are bending their energies.
- Women ; who have, been -most eager for
emancipation from" the home admit they
have "gone, too far and are now -willing, to
go back, to the "prison" they despised:
For they see it' no longer as a prison, but
as thel focusing point for, their highest
abilities and best endeavors.
It : is "simply ' the return -swing of the
pendulum to the chappy medium.
i There , isn' t any question 7 that woman's
glimpse of I the outer world . has greatly
benefited her. There Isn't any doubt
about], her I having achieved much that is
great and good ". in the world- outside. > -
"Not for a moment" would I attempt to
minimize the importance .of the "reforms

THE PLAINTIFF WO.V.
The jury women had been duly impan
eled to hear and weigh the evidence in
the somewhat celebrated divorce action of
Cieevcr against Cleever, anu the attorney
for the plaintiff was addressing them. .
"We propose to show to the beautiful
and inteiliKent members of this jury," he
said, while a coy smile 3tole over the
faces of it 3 members, "that this defend
ant, whom I' scorn to mention by another
and more fitting designation, has con
stantly and â¢ systematically treated his
wife, the plaintiff in this action, with a
cruelty inconceivable by lovely women
born to a happier lot."
The attorney paused to cool his lips
with water, while the forewoman leaned
toward her neighbor to ask if her hat
was on straight.
"In pursuance of this purpose," the at
torney resumed, "we propose to show to
the charming and intellectual members of
this jury that the defendant actuallyâ l
shudder : to speak the words, ladies, but
he actually insisted that the plairttlff, his
wife, should keep an account of house
hold expenses, well knowing how impos
sible she wsuld find it."
The lips of the forewoman were seen
to form , the words, "The wretch!" but
she did not utter them.
"And. fascinating, ladies of the jury."
the attorney continued, "that she should
keep themâ Jn a book!"
"The brute !'% the forewoman whispered
to the jury woman on her left, and the
latter resnended, "Just isn't he?"
"In pursuance of this fell arid base de
sign," the attorney continued, "he either
cajoled or affrighted her into compliance
with his*enoimous demand. Fair ladies
of this rare jury, he bought the book! 1
repeat the words: He bought the book?
took^lt Into the sweet, confiding and
theretofore peaceful bosom of his fam
ily, andâ Mrs. Cleever used it! Need I
say more? The serpent was in, the gar
den! Nay, no more could be said!
The jury whispered. "The, monster!" as
with one voice, and then the attorney re
sumed his speech. .-â¢.â¢"
."And yet there Is an unutterable and
Inconceivable more which might and. in
deed, must be said. Nightly thereafter it
was the, habit 'of this defendant, whom I
will riot designate by his appropriate ti
tie, to sit by the side of the sweet plain
tiff, my client, and when she added three
and seven and twelve and said that the
sum was thirty-nine, he smiled In lofty
scorn. Yes. fair ladies of the jury. Into
that bruised and bleeding heart he
drove the sharpened barb of a cold and
cruel sneer!
"And when she subtracted five from
eighteen and said that the result was
twenty-one, he even laughed! Ah, beau
tiful ladies 01 the jury, the great poet
has # said that- a man may smile and smile
and* b2 a yillain .still, r and no .less true
it is that a man may laugh and laugh
and be a merciless lobster."
, After the attorney had concluded his
opening remarks, the Judge had much
difficulty in prevailing upon the Jury to
wait until It had heard the evidence be
fore giving its verdict, and after the evi
dence had been heard the members ren
dered; a verdict for; the heartbroken
plaintiff 1 without leaving their seats.
Thus did justice score another triumph,
"for," as the forewoman afterward re^
marked to a confidential friend, "if we
permit that kind of thing, just think of
the trouble it "would make for lots and
lots of us women!"
, "And besides," another jurywoman
chimed in, "that handsome attorney for
dear Mrs. Cheever did make such a per
fectly lovely " speech !"

Four Facts For
Sick Women
To Considez
Lydia B. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
â¢ Has an Unequalled Rccotd of Cures â
Mrs. 'Pink^asi's Advice Is Confiden-
tial, Free, and alicavs Helpful
First. â That almost every operation
In our hospitals performed upon women
becomes necessary through neglect of
isnch symptoms as backache, irregular
â¢ and painful menstruation, leucorrhoca,
displacements of the uterus, pain in
tiie side, burning sensation in the stom-
ach, bearing-down pains, nervousness,
..dizziness and sleeplessness.
â¢ Second.â The medicine that holds
the record for the Icreest number of
absolute cures of female ills is Lydia
E. PJnkham's Vegetable Compound,
It regulates, strengthens and cures
diseases of the female organism as
nothing else can.
For thirty years it has been helping
women to be strong, curing backache,
.nervousness, kidney troubles, alluter-
f me and ovarian inflammation, weak-
ness and displacements, regulating
menstruation perfectly and overcom-
ing its pains. It has also proved itself
invaluable in preparing for childbirth
"and the change of life.
Tebd. â The great volume of unso-
licited and grateful testimonials on file
at the Pinkham Laboratory at Lynn,
Mass.. many of which are from time to
time published by permission, give ab-
solute evidence of the value of Lydia
. E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound and
Mrs. Pinkham's advice.
Focbtu. â Every ailing woman in the
United States is asked to accept the
following invitation. It is free, will
bring you health and may save your
life.
.Y,rs.P2nkharn's Standing Invitation
to Women.â Women suffering from any
form of female weakness are invited to
promptly communicate with Mrs. Pink-
â¢ ham. at Lynn, Mass. All 3-tters are
received, opened, read and answered
by women only. Prom symptoms given,
your trouble may be located and the
quickest and surest way of recovery
advised. Out of the vast volume of ex-
perience in treating female ills Mrs.
Pinkham probably has the very knowl-
edge that will help your case. Surely,
any woman, rich or poor, is very foolish
if she does not take advantage of tulÂ«
1 generous offer ofassistanco*

But Unseen Things in the
SteinwayVertegrand
Architectural beauty is fairly, spelled, and durability is
indicated in its every outline, but' there are unseen things in
; trlis picture of a Steinway Piano. . â¢
You cannot see the fascination in its smooth, even scale,
arid 'delightful TOUGH. '
You ; cannot see the charm in its ACTION as the - fingers
rgo over the keyboard. â¢
You cannot see. the richness in its pure, clean TONES.
The sense of touch and the sense of hearing cannot be
adequately described, and they cannot' be pictured. But you
can -\u25a0\u25a0 see the name-r-
STEINWAY
We want you to see this Stcinway Piano, . We .want you to see
this particular styleâ the newest thing in the regular Steinway crea-
tion â exactly s the same action. No lowering of quality in workman-,
ship. or materials. It's the real Steinway, set in a plainer case,
thereby reducing the cost $75.
Other Steinway styles $600 to $1500 and up.
â The Steinway Vertegrand $525.
: -We '-think- the Vertegrrand one of the handsomest Stofn-
way designs. We take other pianos In trade and give time
on .the balance. \u25a0 â¢

BLAZE STARTS IN THE TOWER AND RAPIDLY SPREADS THROUGH 'STRUCTURE
FIREMEN HAVE
A HARD FIGHT
WITH FLAMES
Newspaper Suffers Heavily in
the Editorial and Com
posing Rooms.
FINE LIBRARY IS DESTROYED
Tfte San Francisco Chronicle building at Market and Kearny streets
was ratted last night by a lire which broke out shortly before midnight in;
the roof of the tall tower* Water could not be forced to the top for'nonie time.
Tb* flames destroyed the tower and worked down through the building to
Ch* third floor. The editorial, typographical and art departments were de
stroyed, as was the large library.
Mnrh damage was done by water and by flre down to the third floor,
The blase started either from fireworks or 'from crossed electric wires in'
tke tower. The flames were extlagulshed at 2 o'clock this morning. The
mmmaremcÃt of the Chronicle could not give an estimate either as to the
damag* to the building or to the newspaper plant. The basement was
flooded with water, but other than the damage done to paper the loss there
vrlll not be heavy, the repair of the the presses not being difficult.
Flre that had been smoldering for
several hours broke out at 11:46 o'clock
last night In the tower of the San.
Francisco Chronicle building at Market
and Kearny streets, and. fanned by the
high wind, enveloped the tall struc
ture above the roof in a few minutes.
Alarms were sounded in one, two,
three order, bringing out a major part
of the department's apparatus. The
Height of the tower prevented the fire
men from getting effectively at work
until full pressure from many streams
had been concentrated in the powerful
monitor and two water towers.
Even with the immense volume of
water that was then brought to bear,
the flames in brilliant, fantastic colors,
swept_ around and through the high
tower, the spectacle being" one of the
most picturesque that could be imag
ined.
â¢ Tbe large corner eupjjorts of tbe
tower, nnea wntn " copper" sheutnfrfg, 1
burned furiously In the wind, the hues
of peacock Iridescence coloring the
masses of flames that shot their forked
tongues through the rapidly crumbling
edifice.
Swiftly the fire worked through the
great clock faces, bursting in every di
rection and making a beacon light visi
ble for many miles around and attract
ing thousands of ""sightseers to the
scene.
FIREMEN WORK FAST.
The firemen. under command of
Chief Engineer Sullivan, directed their
attention toward checking the flames
on the roof, as the great masses of
burning woodwork and heated metal
collapsed as the tower was destroyed.
Much of this burning debris fell into
the streets, sending myriads of sparks
through Market street as they crashed
to the pavement. At one time there
was danger that the Palace Hotel
might catch afire from the millions of
fiery eparks and bits of embers that
\u25a0were blown furiously from the burning
tower.
Crowds of sightseers, who would not
move from the danger zone until the
police reserve forced them behind the
lines, seemed fascinated by the superb
spectacle. Fortunately the tower did
not collapse as a whole while It was
burning.
The roof, which Is of cement, sup
ported on the west side of the tower
a larga structure of. wood and galvan
ised Iron, used for storing typographi
cal material. This caught and was
soon all in flames, the flre working on
that elde through the roof into the
composing-room. On the east side the
flames licked their way down through
the base of the tower Into the editorial
rooms. So quickly did the fire spread
that the editorial staff got out of the
building without saving anything of
the day's work. Copy, forms and all
of the office and composing' room
paraphernalia on the eighth floor just
under the massive tower were de
stroyed.
While the heavy streams from the
battery and towers on the outside were
hammering at tbe roof and tower
many single streams were sent into the
H building, hosemen using: the elevators
the staircases, as well as the pom
pier scaling- ladders, to reach the floors
Inside.
FLAMES WORK DOWTTWABD.
The flames worked downward and at [
12:30 o'clock this morning had got a hold
â¢en the seventh floor, destroying on the
west side the oaces of John J. Deane, the
office superintendent- The private offices
of SI. U. de Young:, proprietor, of the
building, of John P. Young, the* managing
editor, were- gutted. Through the wails
the flames worked steadily downward, de
epiie the many streams of water that
were leveled at them. Flre attacked the
floors below the seventh at 1 o'clock this
morning and mode more or less headway
as far as the third floor in.spots.
The fine reference library of the edi
torial department, one of the largest and
: .most complete in the newspaper world,
, 'was badly damaged by water, and It was
feared that fire had also worked-Irrepara
ble injury in that department.
Jack McManus. the elevator boy In me
building, was a hero of the flames. He
stayed at his post hauling. firemen tip and
â dGTfn until the flre burnt the lift ropes.
Fred J. Hewitt, a reporter, was caught!
by water and falling debris while * at
tempting to save some -of the,'photo
graphic apparatus.
"The flre. It is - supposed, started from
fireworks that had been left on the roof
\u25a0where signals - announcing election re
sults had been set off early in the even-
Ing. Another cause assigned was sparks
from crossed electric wires used In Ilium
inating the clock dials. This was sug- '
Eested by John P. Young; the managing!
Vfcfiitor, as a probable cause. . '
<It was discovered that the elevator!
ehaf ts were furnishing a . way for the j .
flames to work down , from the roof. In J
eplte of the steel beam construction and!

tiled flooring the names found their way
through by following the woodwork that
was laid over the tiling in many of the
rooms.
All of the mechanical department of the
paper, except the presses and the press
room equipment, was destroyed. Included
In the heavy damage was the destruction
of a very large collection of photographs
and other miscellany that cannot be re
placed. These collections represent many
years of labor and were among the most
valuable adjuncts to the newspaper. The
large equipment of linotype machines and
â¢the other paraphernalia of the compos
! ing-room were destroyed.*
I At 1:30 o'clock this morning the tower
I was gone, only a few blackened steel
| beams remain. The upper roof was de
j stroyed.- â¢ .... . â .
Most of the offices ort' the floors below

damage being done to paper stored there.
The presses were not seriously damaged.

NEW EVIDENCE
LS r SMOOT CASE
Said to Be Very Damaging
to the Harassed Utah
Senator. . ;
Special , Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON-, Nov. 7.-Evidence said
to be very damaging to the case of Sen-"
ator Reed Smoot of Utah is to be given
to the Senate Committee on Privileges
and Elections as soon 1 as Congress opens.
It will be presented in face of the fact
that both sides â¢to the controversy de
clared that all the testimony they had
to offer 'had .-been' given', and- that the
members of the committee believed they
could consider it and turn in a jport.
prior to the Christmas recess.
Interests inimical to the Smoot cause
have been making investigations during
the summer, and as a result the already.
long-/rawn-but case will see a renewal
of committee, activities, before the wait
ing Senate gets a chance to tell the Utah
man to go or to stay.
Senator,Jullus Caesar Burrows of Mich
igan, chairman of the committee which
has the Mormon Senator's case . in ,. hear
ing, has. returned to Washington, and -it 'is
known that .he expects .to . ask ; his v fel
low-committee members to listen. to more

"I can form no estimate of the' damage done by the lire,** wild Joh* P.

have, saved .this valuable acquisition. \u25a0 \u0084,â¢'"-
Our future plans are very, indefinite. The whole matter rests wit*
Mr. de Young. ' He went over ; to San. Rafael early, in the evening:. I rnes*
we will have .to" rely on The Call and Examiner to render us their klad
assistance for the next few days, and in that way we hope to get the pa-;
per out. .
"The -fire undoubtedly started from crossed wire* In the tower. I can
not conceive "of nn.v other cause, though the theory has been advanced that'
the bombs we nred had something to do with It. The Fire Department*
labored under difficulties. \u25a0 It did great work In subduing the flames aa
quickly as it did."
A 'tiny jet of flame burst out of the
clock tower at about a quarter to 12.
The. north wind fanned it into: an omin
ous, blaze.: A ~ few . minutes later flre
gushed f rcm' the tower on all } sides.
. clt. was the hardest 7 problem in flre
fighting .that, has ever confronted the
Ideal department. "Aneffort was made, to
run a 1a 1 hose 'up on the elevator. I . but the
ropes on the lift were burned ; off- An !
attempt" to use the- water , tower was
given up. Three engines concentrated
their power, into a water battery and a
stream was raised that barely reached the
blaze in the sky. \u25a0; A' line of hose was run
up on the Crocker building "and \u25a0 another
stream; wast turned . upon the nre. But
the wind still- fanned the flames into ac

' : Five'' minutes after. < th e^ fire-^ was : first
seen from I the street '-the face. of .the clock

glass and iron from . the " big. timepiece j
splashed down upon, the sidewalk, scat

had ; been.; trying to " press \u25a0 closer to .the
building started back: in alarm. As, the
streams of water struck the molten stuff
it exploded, 1 scattering like shrapnel.
/ A" continual j cataract" "of live coals and
redhot metal, fell through the elevator
shaft. Smoke began to gush out of the
upper story windows 'as the; flre worked
sullenly < downward.
The fight of- the .-Fire- Department was
a wonderful spectacle. "High above the
street the flames crackled like . Vesuvius
in Its wrath. In. the half light the fire
men looked like a throng of busy, demons
stirring about in their natural element.

The clock acted " like a human thing.
.When 'the flre began to^gush out on all
sides the minute hand was at the quar
ter hour before 12. As the . flames be
gan : to " lap* the face that overlooked
Market street, this hand continued In
its course.
.At five minutes to twelve the gigan
tic hand paused and. It seemed.
* gave a twitch of agony. It lifted It
self, warped by the fierce heat, to. the
hour of midnight. There It . stopped
for a few moments as though to say.
""Well, jI have run my full course. I
have done my ..duty."
Then It dropped helplessly and mads

writhed there as If In agony. __ '\u0084_â¢'.
The'biir "minute* haiid â¢ made another ef
fort to lift : itself. - It was like the strug
gle of a soldier who has received a death
wound \u25a0 trying to join : once more in the
j charge." It lifted almost Imperceptibly.
Then it fell with a crash to the pavement,
a warped -and twisted bit of iron.
In less than half an hour tha 'clock
tower was entirely consumed In the in
satiate maw of the fire. Masses of the
clock mechanism, heated white hot.
dropped.s izzling down to the pavement.
And the flre worked steadily and suilenly
downward.
FIREMEN'S BRAVE FIGHT.
A cordon of police was stationed around
the building, keeping the crowds -back.
From windows in near-by buildings
crowds .watched the . spectacular blaze.
The flames made the streets around aa
bright as day.
At; one time there was a report circu
lated that . some of the staff had been
caught on the ninth story. Ernest Simp
son, city editor of the Chronicle, and
'Fred J. Hewitt, -a reporter, had gone up
to the : editorial rooms to try to save
some of the property. They came out
drenched with water and blackened by
smoke. They managed to save \u25a0 some
valuable" photographic apparatus. Friends
deterred them from making any further
attempt.
While the crew of the water* tower
were trying to work the huge machine
nearer the building, a shower of live coals
poured down upon them. The men darted
back just In time. a flood of 'molten
stuff from the clock tower poured down
upon the water tower, y
Never, before has the Baa Francisco
Fire Department been given such an op
portunity to show its mettle. Asd the
flre laddies were not found wanting.
Toward 2 o'clock this morning the sullen
red glow at the top of , the building: began
to dulL The heavy stream from the water
battery ' beat down the flames. At 2 the'
blaze was beaten In a fight; as plucky as
any ever put up by a flre department.' ' â¢ *

MODEL OF ST. PETER'S MAY SOON BE
SEEN IN UNITED STATES.
Replica of the Famous Edifice Measures' Eight
Feet From the. Base to the Dome.
LONDON. Nov.' '7.â Probably -ere : long
people in America will have 3th/Â«ppor
lunity of ku^ ig the exquisite' m'ftd^l of
St. Peter's, Rome, which* attracted a
deal of attention when placed on exhi
bition in London recently. The jjboto-
Kraph of the model of necessity , con
veys only' a, faint idea of the fidelity
end accuracy with -which the archi-.
tectural masterpiece of the world has
been reproduced. It measures eight
feet in height from the base, to the
top of the dome, twenty-one feet in
length and ten feet in width. Its crea
tion is due to the genius, patience and
piety of a Dominican lay brother. An
drea Gambassini. who died in 1838 at
the age of 59 years. For twenty-eight
years he worked at it unremittingly,
encouraged in turn by Leo XII, Pius
VIII and Gregory XVI. It was a latter
of love with the poor Dominican. No
hope of pecuniary gain stimulated him.
Not only is the exterior of the Basilica,
with its hundreds of statues of Popes
and BiÃhops and saints, reproduced
with scrupulous exactitude, but the in- ;
terior is also portrayed with the same
painstaking fidelity. By an ingenious
mechanism the church can be opened, |
revealing its numerous chapele, altars,
paintings and statuary. The materials '.
employed are precious woods and ivory,
the latev for the statuary, which are
identical in all but size with the
marble original*. When one considers
the enormous amount of the most deli- |
cate workmanship involved, the wonder ;
Is that one pair of hands and a single
lifetime sufficed for'such a task. -j
Shortly before his death, Gambassini'
had the great satisfaction of seeing his
trork completed and placed in the won
derful museum of the'Vatlcani- There/it
remained until, 1849, -when PiiisiX pre
â¢sentco" it to the Prince of Tarlogna,
Syndic of Rome, for distinguished ser
vices renflered to the Holy See. Had
Gamb^sin! foreseen the day when It
would pass Into the hands of those who
are strangers to his faith and be treated
as a commercial commodity, lMs doubt
ful If he would ever have . finished it.
Like its original,' it is the greatest
\u25a0work of its kind in the world. .

By^a provision of . the law of 19C& the

Every part of a camphor tree, even
to the leaves, contains camphor.

extensive supply -of native forest' growth
and many hu*re. trees~are to be found in
regions EtilU. unezplcrred. , The - supply,
therefore. Is assured for years to come.
Camphor is found in thÂ« form of crj's

Among the *by-"pro3ucts- may be men

crude camphor telL as well as black oil," I
\u25a0which !s extensively used In therprep-* !

A turpentine is â¢ secured from the

CANADA HAS
A NEW FLAG
Mixed Population of French,
British and Irish at Times
Used Five Other Standards
EMBLEM NOW ADOPTED
Came Into General Use Dur
ing Feast of St. Jeaii Bap
tiste â Meets v Approval
After using four or five* flags differing"
from the Canadian flag proper, ' French'
Canada has at last hit upon an emblem
which seems to come, more nearly than
any of the. others to expressing the. real
national aims and desires- of the -French-
Canadians. Although the \u25a0 new standard
i-s not assured of universal acceptance, it
has been virtually adopted and is : being
largely employed by groups of French-
Canadians throughout the whole of Can
ada and* also for church and other deco
rations in certain French-Canadian settle
ments in the New/ England states.
The new flag was suggested in several
quarters more' than a year ago, but.it
suddenly sprung into" general use duel ng
the various celebrations of the - national
festival of St. Jean Baptiste. which. hÂ«fve
been held recently in tbe,prlnclpal center^
of population of the French-Canadians.
The ground of the new flag is sky blue
and. is divided into four parts by a large
white cross. Ihe arms of . which run .. di-,
rectly up and down and across
the bunting.- In- the corner of-Xhe.fiag is
placed a white spearhead, or fleur-de-lis,
while standing out in the color of fire at
the intersection of the arms of the cross
is a representation ; of the > Sacred Heart.,
Visitors have always " been struck with
the number of French tricolors decorating
the streets and public, buildings -of Mon
treal, Ottawa, Quebec and other parts of
French-Canada. This" year the French
colors are still occasionally in evidence,
\u25a0but are being rapidly displaced by; the
mew flag. 'J : \u25a0'-\u25a0\u25a0/' ' '' \u25a0\u25a0 '\u25a0\u25a0
SENTIMENTAL INTEREST.

of 23, men with 51.000,000' eacn. Now only

and there are 1300 of them in New York

sheep, ranch worth $150,000,000; and in
South Africa "Abe" Benley Is so rich
that he gave 50.000,000 acres of valuable
land as a contribution to the Salvation

Among .the millionaires : of London "Sir

of the infant Earl Grosvenor, valued con

premier Duke of Norfolk, whose income is
$7300 a day. \ \f--y

as $250,000 each, and these are Japan's
richest. Our. Senator Clarke "or Mr.

the entire 441. And yet Japan has no
paupers. It/is ; a land of -people well

well tilled./: Their: wealth is evenly dis

rich are lavishly ; elegant in ' their man

N0v... 7.â O* all the!gentle

& closer resemblance to Hornung's fas

riftade a- voluntary appearance at tha

i maintain, a- valet.' 'And It was to sayÂ»
.this servant; William Lawson, from suf
fering the consequences of some of. his
master's crimes that Marsh, escorted by
two stalwart warders, had "come from
Wormwood Scrnbbs, where he la serving
a" five-years' sentence.
"The police 'said the two men . had lived
together 'and had . been associated in
marauding expeditions." In V the housa
where they arrestea , Lawsoa they found
"a. box containing a lot of plundered prop
erty? which" they charged Lawson with,
stealing. Lawson declared that he didn't
know the property had been stolen,' and
didn't know that his master Â» burg
lar. Marsh always seemed to have plenty
of money, Lawson. sajd,. and .he .under
stood that he waste gentleman of private
means. Marsh's frequent absence from
his chamlwrs at night Lawson had be* n
led to believe was due to the attention
"which, he was paying to a wealthy
young: lady.
Despite his close cropped hair and shab
by clothing there was an unmistakable
air of distinction about Marsh's clean
shaven features. He spoke in a well mod
uiated voice and the manner in which.
he gave his testimony showed that he had
received a good education. . He . entered ,
the witness, box with the utmost sang
froid. There was a touch of Raffles In
the way he began his evidence. â¢ .

It was through accident, Marsh said,
that he became acquainted with Lawson.
One of, the lodgers, by way of a joke,

"Did not Lawson comment on your
bringing the things home?" asked one of
the counsel. .
.'"Let me see; yes, he did ask a ques

mood. Ã¼butu but as I ignored it, he did not
ask again. The fellow, you see. had good

WITH THE UNITED STATES
EDUCA TIONAL CO-OPERATION IS FIRST STEP
Special D i snatch to ThÂ» Call.
* BERLIN, Nov. 7. â Emperor "William's
proposal for an exchange of profes
sors between uerman and American
universities, which is soon to have a
practical inauguration, has a political
mainspring worthy and characteristic
of the imperial mind that launched it.
The Kaiser intends .his intellectual
"community of interests' to be a first
a.r.d lasting rivet iv the German-Amer
ican alliance lor which he hopes.
\u25a0 With a. penetration always looking a
decade or two ahead â one of William
ll's distinguished traitsâ the Kaiser
figures tha.t tne young men of to-day,
both in Germany and the United States,
will be the statesmen and the political i
leaders of their respective countries
ten, fifteen and twenty years hence.
With that in mind he believes in ex- j
h&usting every means to bring the
young "men of the two nations into in
tellectual contact. A college man him
self, he knows the ties and memories
ihat cling to university days, the dur
ability of friendships and affections
formed In those "halcyon hours," and
as he understands how they cement re
lations between men, so would he have
relations between peoples and Govern
ments solidified by a bond of mutual
acquaintance and regard. That is why
he wants American university students
who ran afford to imbibe "German
ideals" at the fountain headâ at Ger
man universities â to hear from the lips
of German professors and savants the
lessons that German science, literature
8-nd art have to teach, and In .the same
way to give German students, with
whom attendance at American univer
sities is still very much of a novelty,
the opportunity to acquaint themselves
with American culture at the hands of
American lecturers on German soil.
INTERCHANGE OF LECTURERS.
Professor Dr. Ostwald, the famous
chemistry authority of the University of
Leipsic, who recently arrived in the
United States to give a series of lectures
at Harvard, is the pioneer of the men
the Kaiser purposes sending periodically
gto America for the carrying out of his
â¢ scheme. Before Dr. Ostwald has finished
fcis lectures Professor Peabody of Har
vard will be in Berlin expounding his
favorite theme of Christian morals be
fore classes of German students. Nfxt
winter Professor Dr. Delitzsch, the dis
tinguished Assyriologist of the University
of Berlin, will go to Leland Stanford to
discourse upon Babylonian questions, and
about that lime Dr. J. Laurance Laugh
lln of the University of Chicago will
travel to Germany to lecture on political
economy. So the Interchange, it is

GERMAN UNIVERSITY WHERE
AMERICAN PROFESSORS WILL.
LECTURE UNDER KAISER'S
NEW PLAN.
planned, shall go on from eeason to sea
son.
The language difficulty will be a handi- (
cap in many instances. There are be
lieved to be very few professors, elthei
in Germany or in the United States, cap
able of lecturing upon their specialty in
the language of the other country. This
phase of the Kaiser's project was recent
ly discussed in detail between his Majesty
and President Nicholas Murray Butler!
and Dean Burgess of Columbia, and some
mode of minimizing this undoubted draw
backâperhaps the use of interpretersâ it '\u25a0
was admitted would have to be found to|
Insure the practical success of the Em
peror's gcheme.
UNDER STATE , CONTROL.
There are twenty-three universities in
Germany. N All of them are under state
control. The largest is the University ol
Berlin, which has between 8000 and 9000
registered students. \u25a0 Two thousand ot
them are -foreigners, mostly Russians.
The American colony at the Berlin
University averages from 200 to 300 a
term. It always includes ten or a dozen
women, and occasionally a negro or two.
The medical faculty is the department
that attracts most Americans to the his
toric old institution on Unter den Linden,
although the. theological department, pre
sided over by Professor Harnack, draws
many divinity post-graduates from the
United States. At Jena, Leipzic, Heidel
berg, Goettingen, Halle, Gerifswald and
elsewhere the American element Is al
ways represented. All told, there are per
haps 1000 sons and daughters of Uncle
Sam scattered throughout the German
universities, each going to that particular
one whose specialtyâ medicine,' surgery,
philosophy, history or theologyâ happens
to be particularly attractive. American
women have lone been known as the
keenest feminine students at German in
stitutions. At Jena last winter Miss Morse
of Chicago, a niece of the inventor of the
telegTaph, took the degree of doctor of
philosophy, carving her name indelibly in
the history of that famous, old school as
the first representative of her sex to win
a coveted "dokter titel" there.
TURN OUT SPECIALISTS.
The German university still adheres
to the system of turning out specialists.
At none of the twenty-three schools en
titled to call themselves "universl
taeten" is anything bordering upon
â¢general intellectual equipment, such as
may be had at the universities of
American, to be acquired. A young
Teuton leaves a university fitted to be
a professor of this, that or the other
specialty, a physician, a surgeon, a
scientist, a lawyer or a professional
man of some sort of other, but prac
tically unfitted to enter the great
workaday world of commence, where
general education." rather than special
training in a given branch, is neces
sary. So it is- with the German pro
fessor. He is a . plodder, an indefati
gable researcher in a given furrow. Out
side of it he never ventures. It is for
him the all in all, the "ne plus ultra"
of culture. He infects his students with
that one-sided view of Intellectuality.
It is this system that causes Germany
to bÂ« spoken of frequently as over-edu
cated. You hear Germans themselves
say their universities turn out "too
many wise men" each year and too few
mentally equipped to take their* places
in the general, everyday affairs of the
nation's life. One influential German
voice has been lifted up in favor of
minimizing the specialty systemâ the
voice of Professor Frederick Paulsen,
who is a frank, admirer of American
university standards, but he has few
supporters.
PITY KAISER'S PROPOSAL.
The reluctance of German university
authorities to listen to talk of "Amer
icanization" is due to something bor
dering upon constitutional contempt for
"Yankee culture." German professors
regard Americans In trieir: proper; field
of activity in packing; 'pork, Â«\u25a0 building
bridges and locomotives and financing
trusts, but in the realm of art, science
and culture they still consider, tho sons
of Columbia more or ' less "outsiders."
Tney r think country ~ar too \u25a0 young,
still too barren of history and tradi
tions, to bent soil for. the Inculcation
of real, knowledge. Deep down In- their
hearts it is probable they have noth
ing but pity for the Kaiser's proposal,
based as 'it is on the : presumption that
American university,- men really^ have
something tp say which Germans can af
ford to learn. Germans have so .long
been ' the ! mentors ' of Americans . educa
tionally that they ; shrink from-;Jlhe

COLLEGE LIFE MISSING.
:â¢ Dearest of ; sentimental memories' are
j associated in song and story' with German
j student life, and rightly, yet the \u25a0'.'college
! spirit" of American university " life is ut
j terly unknown here. That is attributable
; to two reasonsâ first; the fact 'that stu
} dents do not live at or near the univer
{ slty in this country, there being no dor
mitory system; secondly, the complete
absence of athletics. The American col
lege fraternity finds its replica in the
fatherland in the form of the "studenten
korps," a secret "society, whose functions
are limited, however, to singing and
drinking. Outside of these boisterous
nights of music and liquor, indeed, there
i is no "college life" in Germany, as 1 we in
ohe United States know it.
There are dueling bouts galore, but no
football; no rowing, no tennis, no base
' ball, no g3 - mnasium or anything of 'the
sort regarded as indispensable in Ameri
can institutions of learning. .The Kaiser is
a "frat man." He is an alumnus of Bonn,
that beautifully located university on the
banks of the Rhine, and he journeys back
to his alma mater every year to attend
the annual reunion of his "fraternity," the
"Kfyrps Borussia." On these occasions his
rank as Emperor temporarily^ lapses. He
dons the uniform of the "korp" and sings
and drinks with his comrades on terms of
full equality. It was while at Bonn* that
the' Kaiser i made the acquaintance of
Poultney Bigelow. the American writer.
Between them a warm friendship sprang
up, but it was wrecked a few years ago
when Bigelow entered the service of an
American life insurance company in Ger
many and attempted to exploit his college
comradeship for bus'ness purposes. ;

Gabriele d'Aiinuiizio Says
"Amaranta" Is Certain to
Attract Mucji Attention
Special Dlai'atch ato The CÂ«JI.
LONDON, \ Nov. 7.â From an acquaint^
ance who recently vl3ited / Gabriele
d'Annunzio, ; I learn that the foremost
of Italian novelists expects" 'great
things of a new romance which ; he haÂ«
nearly finished. It is called "Amar
anta" and D'Annunzio believes-ithat it
will be fuund as original , and will jat
tract as much attention as that: mem
orable work of his, 'The Triumph of
Death," whose morality was called .in
question --so .severely iri;> the' }United
States. -, .' -â¢ '
- D'Annunzio says that his -new. novel
is entirely modern .and written with_
the object of proving that even our
times can be made poetical. The hero
ine - will represent a 4 psychological
tyi-e -v/hich the author" anirms is now
only beginning to be noticed in real
life,"2but which will, he says, be the
type of woman of the. future. The
story is based on an episode ',which
took place some time ago in Paris. Its
heroine* 'was a girl of gentle birth, who,
although in- consumption, had herself
tied to an' autor.iob lie which nightly
encircled * the celebrated "Ring or
Death' 1 ;; for^ the sake of the sensation.
Everything was done to stop the crazy
enterprise,' but the girl insisted, threat
ening suicide, and was" allowed to go.
After the first round she was found
dead. \.
D'Annunzlo's heroine,' Amaranta,
leaves the ; family, riches and society
to which she was born, to join^a.cir
cus, jand comes,- with her. delicacy of
feeling 'and j refined . intelligence, into
close contact with the hardened men
of the'stables and trapeze. What' her
fate is D'Annunzio declined to disclose,
but he - declared that Amaranta : re
mains "delicately romantic where: life
seems most arid and bitter and least
novel." ' '
FIXDS LOST MEMOiaS.
There is rather a aueer history, in
connection 1 , with ' two volumes: of me
moirs that are about to be published
in London. They were written over a
century ago by "Buck," or -"Jerusalem"
Whaley, who was a famous 'lrish poli
tician and gambler. * Toward: the end
o* his life this picturesque character
regretted his "follies and | these remi
niscences' of his were written :as a
warning to others. He left orders that
they'should bepubllshed by his execu
tors, but for some reason this was not
done, .and' eventually the manuscript,
which was bound in two large quarto
volumes, v disappeared ! entirely.V ,Not
long ago Sir Edward Sullivan, theirish
classical scholar,' who is also- a keen
collector of bindings, while browsing
around : in a- second-hand shop/'^came
across a couple of old volumes, :which
he bought for the sake of their covers,
and on opening : them discovered â¢ the
long; lost .( memoirs: pf i v "Buck"v- Whaley.

which made him famous for, a time as

ROME, I Nov. *' 7.â That . most * plctus
esquq relic of the days .when the Papacy
excercised , something like .'" real tempo
ral , power,, the ; Swiss Guard, is prepar
ing to celebrate \ the fourth centenary
of its formation"..) There are four other
Papal corps;' arid one. of them, the Noble
Guard, : is ;, of I still f. morel ancient ; origin,
dating^.back to 1488,>but :: the Swiss
Guard has long, attracted most atten-.
tion ambngr^visitbrs to the Eternal City.
.This ", has ; aroused the jealousy \ of .the
other., bodies comprising the little Papal
army, - for, : ,alsasl. ; 'envy, 'malice' and- un

the confines of the Apostolicpalace. In
case of an attack'it. would certalnly.not
be "united we * stand," â¢'; but decidedly
"divided (we fall."

stalwart young Catholics from iGerman
Switzerland. .: They v/atch;over ; the va
rious'\u25a0. entrances to "the [ palace" arid are

great- zest : into the preparations: for
their â centenary, and at his own ex

ESTAIJIiiSIIED IX 1505.
In .: October, 1505, he brought from
Switzerland ; 200' Swiss â¢ youths,' com
manded by Gaspare de Silonen, a noble
man of Lucerne, who subsequently died
in' Rome .! He constituted them his own
personal' bodyguard, .designating them
oflicially "Pretoriani excubitores Ponti
tidiS; corporis et : palatii costodlae"â
"Pretorian:= guards of the person and
palace of ; the I Pope." .The idea -of such
a' quar y d" did 'not originate with' Julius
"11, but with :his predecessor, Nicholas V.
This Pontiff;^however, : was afraid to
carry the iidea" out in face of tho oppo
sition" of i Louis XII, who" threatened; to
do a lot of things if the project
was" riot abandoned. II was not
easily intimidated,; and finding; the idea
to his:taste, lost; no time in giving ef
fect to \u25a0 it. But the poor Swiss ,'subse
quently had to pay! for :their rashness
with . their lives. 'In the Pontificate of
Clement VII; the terrible -Constable de
Bourbon' led a force against j Rome and
sacked the city. .The guards barricaded
themselves In: St. Peter; s and sold their
lives dearly, bu t ; he got them all ; not
one escaped. For twenty-one l years
thereafter no effort was" made- to re
form.this guard, but in^ 1548. 1 under
Paul ' 111, it '; was .again organized. It
has existed ever 'since, with : ; two short
interruptions,' during the"French.occu
pations in; 1798 and 1809,' but it returned

i though \u25a0 sanctioned by custom. This
I was the payment of $100^ to each mem
berof .the force for his extra work dur
ing the : conclave,- cr "sede vacante," as j
it is called. Thirty of the boldest; (
backed by the mbral support of their I
comrades, took their arms, barricaded j
themselves in their barracks and de- J
clared^.war! : Neither .prayers nor'
threats, ~\ nor "bribes could , move them. \
Nothing but their money would satisfy â¢
them,*and>when^that, after, three days, j
was forthcoming they-eome forth, too. i
But . Leo XIII ; had his revenge, as he |
'kept them .waiting for twenty-five
years for the next ;'sede vacante," while
the average length of the Pontificate is
only from six to eight years.
-The colonel 'of the guard is Karl
Pyffer. d'Altlshofen of Lucerne, whose
family is inextricably mixed with the
history of the Swiss Guard. Already
nine of the same house have heia the
post of commandant, - and ; there is no
doubt Pyffer held the post in 1C52 under
Clement- X.;' The '.family. : of/; course,
comes from â¢ Lucerne,' .but the branch ;
to. which Colonel Karl belongs had
long been domiciled in the Eternal City.
He Is most indefatigable In the inter

activity. . . â¢
SIGXFOR FIVE YEARS.
The - guards | themselves sign for five
years" 'service, - which .can be : renewed
if . they wish. After twenty-five years
service they have a pension, but they
can" only Vrise f rom ; the ' ranks to j the
grade of colonel. The men, ' on. the
whole, have little to complain of. Their
pay :is $16; a month, and, as they ara
obliged to beunmarried it quite Bufflces.
The ' officers, of whom : ther s are \ six, of
course "get: very "smair pay, .the position

!- production, as , are, for ; that ! matter,;. the
guards themselves, and I am afraid it
is only in this light that they are re
garded by strangers, who axe apt to
think that they are put in their places
only to look pretty and appropriate.
The whole army of the Pontiff is
composed of five armed corpsâ the
Noble. Swiss and Palantine Guards,
Gendarmes and Firemen, comprising 390
men. more or leas, probably a few more.
During \u25a0 Leo XIII's Pontificate. Rome
was startled one day by an enormous
headline in one of the leading papers.
"Mobilization of the Army," and think
ing that war must be upon her, looked
feverishly for further news, whereupon
the words "Of the Pope" were revealed
in much smaller type, and the Eternal
City breathed freely again.

H STANFORD UNIVERSITY, ; Nov. 7.â
The trustees of, Stanford University ac
cepted ; the bleachers of the i new foot
ball-field -' to-day. The action of the
board signifies that the structure is of
sufficient strength to uphold its burden
of wildly enthusiastic humanity. This
comes as a great relief to Stanfordltes,
"who had heard the rumors'that the ma
terial put into the bleachers did, not
come up to the requisite - dimensions
and that there was a possibility of the
work beinsr condemned.
The action of the board was not
taken until a. favorable report from a
committee of three of the ablest of San
Francisco's engineers \ had' been re
ceived.
> As the date for -the big \u25a0 game - draws
near - preparations are being rushed
with all possible speed. - The officials
who' will act as referee and umpire
have been selected, â¢ and the finishing
touches are being given ,to the new
stadium. All that remains to be ac

of .the gridiron prpper and several
small bits of plumbing in the training

Ilay^s Lands a Long Shot
BY FRED E. MULHOLLAXD.
*, Sport for, sweet charity's sake, conduct
ed under; the auspices of the California
Polo and Pony Racing. Association, was
the attraction yesterday at the Clark
track, San 'Mateo. . ."Warm and balmy
weather, together .with a preposs'esslng
card, drew, out ;\u25a0 both* society and the vil
lage folk "In liberal numbers, adding, con
siderably to the Armitage Orphanage
fund, the beneficiary of the occasion.
The ' gentlemen riders and their diminu
tive mounts . furnished v some superior
racing. .H. i Marah of this city and jJ.
Chauncey Hayes of â¢ Southern California
especially, distinguished themselves, each
piloting two .winners. ; Frank Skinner and
Charles. Dunphy. â¢' were compelled "to be

Mr. Mackay, . the Australian, rode in ill
luck. I
RAMONA AT LONG ODDS. I
Ramona. the first winning mount - of !
Mr. â¢ Hayes, was a despised outsider, $515 1
parls mutuels paying $66 35. A fortunate
investor on the chances of the mare was
\u25a0Will Tevis, the well known society man,
who held two tickets, Ramona being the
given name of Mrs. Tevis. Four of the
choices were dethroned,
i All interest centered in the match race
at three .furlongs \u25a0 betVeen Midlove and
Ulctma. The latter, ridden by Frank
Skinner and sporting the colors of Ru
dolph Spreckels, had first call, but ran
far below his - form. Charley Dunphy,
who rode the Clark entry, early assumed
the lead and won at leisure.
Helen Warwick, a gray mare with. Mr.
Marsh up, captured the introductory
sprint. She was a favorite and easily
disposed., of Ramona and Chanate, the
only other starters.
ALTHOSIER'BEATS BAS BLANCS.
-..Â« Rudolph Spreckels was more fortunate
in the match at half a mile between his
mare Althomer and Bas Blancs, from.
Charles Clark's stable. Bas Blancs ap
peared short on speed," Althomer scoring
in a mild gallop in :51 1-6.
Much jockeying was indulged in by
, the riders while at the post for. the
quarter-mile handicap! Leah was the pick
of the speculators, but finished third, f
The five starters ran : well bunched to
the stretch, where Mr. Hayes with Ra
mona drew away, disposing of Carlotta
and the favorite, Leah, by a length.
\u25a0 :Carlolly, with Mr. Marsh in the saddle,
carried the Spreckels colors to the fore in
the seven-furlong : handicap, â¢ Her stable
imate -Honoma lost the place to Ethel G,
the mount of Mr. Mackay.
But three started in the concluding
three an a half furlong, scramble. ;'- Mr:
Hayes rode" Leah.; Wndlng her; a" clever
first over Althomer and Carlotta.

PITCHER HENLEY'S NERVE
SAVES DAY FOR UNCLE.
Game Ends With One Run on the
Scoreboard for Seals.
_Wlth a full house against which to
pitch ~ln~the ninth Spasm and not a
single . Siwash out of the way. Busher
Henley took the big brace at Recrea
tion Park yesterday, afternoon and- got
the next three men out of the way and
it was all over. It was a pretty, piece
of work", and the fans did not forget to
give Henley the welcome mitt after id
turned the trick. ;.;/â¢;
By the way Seattle started off in tha
ninth it seemed bad for the Seals. Ben
nett led off with a bingler over second
and Kane beat out a bunt. "Walters
bunted to Irwin and Charles booted the
leather long enough, to let Ike tear
safely Into the bag. ,
Along came Blankenship, â¢ and the
Seattle rooters were glad.-for Blank
had already allowed the Seals their
only run on a mistake. , They figured
he would, clean off the bags and make
It easy for Seattle. The only thing
Blank cleaned was the mist. He swung
vainly thrice and" sat down. Along
came* Julie Streib, who forced Bennett
at the plate with a simple one to Hen
ley. Frary could do no better than fly
to Irwin, and then it was good night.
The Seals did not even have to make
a hit to win the game. Nealon opened
up In the second with a fly, which
Blankenship dropped. Joe ambled to
second on the miscue and Householder
bunted him up a peg. . Charley. Irwin
responded with a long fly to Kane, and
Jqe easily breezed home with the. run
that was the goods.
Both pitchers worked like leaguers,
and it- was too bad to see Shields lose
such a game. He had the Seals, jump
ing around like. a flock of kangaroos
all the time. They only copped three
hits off his benders. Both teams fielded
cleverly. The score:

"IX. used to be.'-' ; said * the- dentist. Vthat
everybody wanted his front teeth filled
with gold, but now there are plenty of
people who regard gold fillings that show
as unsightly, and who have their front
teeth filled and built up, if required; with
porecelaln, which matches the teeth In.
color. This porcelain work is one of the
later â¢ advances in the development of.
modern dentistry. . .
"In filling a tooth with gold we drill out
the cavity to make It larger within than
at the opening, but the cavity for a por
celain filling is made slightly larger at
the opening than at the base. The por
celain filling is held 5 In place not by the
narrowing in of its retaining walls at the
opening, as is the case with other fillings,
but by cement. â¢ . '
"With the cavity for a porcelain filling
prepared, a matrix or impression of It ia
taken with a tiny sheet of platinum foil,
which is of the thickness of one-thou
sandth of an inch. Then you select the
porcelain material from which the filling
is to be made. It comes in a powd.er.
"People's teeth vary in color and arti
ficial teeth are supplied in pretty nearly
innumerable varieties of shape and size
and color and "shade and spacing. These
porcelain powders for fillings are made In
many different shades, . and If . the right
shade cannot be found among the stand
ard powders, then the shade desired can
be produced by mixing. It is quite prac
ticable to find a powder or to make a
mixture that will match any tooth per
fectly. \u25a0 ' . \u25a0 - -
"Out of this; powder an inlay Is baked
which fits the cavity in the tooth per
fectly if the' work has been done properly.
The inlay, as I said, -is held in place by
adhesion, with cement. There are many
shades of s porcelain material; there are
also made Inlay cements of many shades.
The proper shade of cement having been
selected and the surface around the cav
ity and that of the back of the inlay hav
ing been, suitably roughened to make the
cement hold the better, \u25a0 you mix" the = ce
ment ! and | apply It and set the Inlay Into
place^'there to be held until the cement
has hardened.. â¢ .
â "Porcelain :1s also used In building up
bick teeth," but It Is used more for,lnlay3
'in" front teeth, where other kinds of fill
ings .would show. '.The making of these
inlays ' calls for the i exercise of fine art
and ;"' skill, but ; the \u25a0 modern dentlat fills

_ * " â¢\u25a0 â¢'â¢ Impediment â¢ â¢- ....,
; \u25a0â¢ Among ~taer^ mtaor : arts -ot- great Im
portance is the self cure of stammering,
\u25a0which comes upon *o many In" early
youth. In the memoir of the author of
"John inglesant." which his widow has
prepared, we read' a . rather touching con
fession. "I contracted the habit of stam
mering," wrote. Mr. Shorthouse to Lady
"Welby. -"as a delicate little boy of three
at a large day schooL It. was not such
a misfortune as might be supposed. For
without this thorn in the flesh 'John
Inglesant* would never have been written
or conceived, and much which is very
dear to me in philosophy would have been
unknown." Few stammerers can bring
a classic forth from "their affliction: and
some would even refuse the author's fame
at the price of the speaker's embarraÂ»Jg
ment. ' W
In many cases the self cure of stammer
ing is easy.. The present writer was a suf
fertr when a boy at a day school. He set
himself to invent the care. It was abso
lutely necessary. 'he found, that the open
ing syllable of a sentence should be said
several times before the sentence was
under weigh (ju3t as the billiard player
waggles his " cue - before the ' " correct
stroke). It occurred that the stammer
ing might be done silently. So that little
boy stammered firmly to himself with,
tightly closed lipÂ«. Imagining himself to
be speaking. It was easy enough, whan
the requisite number of '"tnt-tut-tut*** or
"gug-gug-gugs" had been achieved ia
silence, to start the sentence. Since then
he has never stammered â aloud. â London

Pacific Mail Liner Peru
Takes Her Departure for
.Panama and Way Ports
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Alameda will sail for Honolulu
December 2, with all trace of her ex-
V r > rier.cs on the Fort Point rocks obllt
' '.crated and her hull and machinery in
better condition than ever. She was
the best little liner on the Paciflo'be
fore her misadventure. When she goes
Into commission again she will be Just
a little better than she was before.
She came off the Hunters Point dry
dock, on Monday. In repairing the Ala
tneda the Union Iron Works Is said to
have established a record which could
not be bettered In the United States.
Forty-seven plates In the liner's hull
\u25a0were removed and replaced by new
ones. Forty other plates were dealt
â¢with. There wa* other work done and
the Alameda was on the drydock only
thirteen days. Superintendent of Ship
building- "WlUiam Donald had personal
charge of the work for the Union Iron
Works and to him is due credit for the
good progress being made.
Before she goes Into commission
every inch of the Alameda, inside and
out, will* be overhauled. Cleaning the
machinery Is of Ueelf a huge task, but
when ir is done the Alameda's works
will move more smoothly and to better
purpose than ever. She will take up
her work again as If nothing had hap
pened and will go 'along at the same
steady gait which has made Wr and
her twin, sister, the Mariposa, the mar

against ;, General : Smith \u25a0 have - been, filed
with 1 the department and nothlnf is

in : the '- press dispatches reflecting * opin

In the Philippines ' before > Taf t started on
his present visit to Panama^ but none of
the \u25a0 reports were , from" specially influen
tial: sources: and. little or no notloe was
paid; to i them.
The service of General Smith on the
Philippine \u25a0 Commission . has been highly
satisfactory to; President i Roosevelt " and
Secretary Taf t, â¢ and : his record has been
such as to suggest his name for the place
of Governor General when it was reported
recently; that" Governor Luke Wright was
to resign. - This suggestion . first came
from j several , sources In the Philippines,
where General â¢ Smith Is very popular, and
was vwarmly'. approved 'i by the War De

warmly commended, the wise and tafftful
administration [of | General Smith as bead
of the Department of Education and de
clared ' that : the Philippine schools under
his direction were in. better condition- and
doing better work than ever, before. i\;T:
General Smith has been somewhat han
dicapped in his labors. It \is said, by the
fact that many of the teachers sent -to
the , Philippines \ from > the - States
have undertaken not only educational but
missionary 'work among . the students; and
have striven to further thÂ« *- Interests of
one or another of the religious denomina
tions. ' General Smith \u25a0 has \u25a0 endeavored to
conduct the school system of the Islands
on a broad 'American non-sectarian plan
and has not yielded to the desires of par
tisans of certain denominations. ~ Many
of these disappointed . teachers have from
time to time , returned j home * and have
aired '-\u25a0, their grievances : against General
Smith, through various channels. :It Is
some of these outbursts that have. come
to the : attention of : the War Department
in an Indirect or casual ) way, i but as yet
no formal V charges ' have been ; made
against him, f and ; Judging by ; the senti

Immigrants Take Out the
Policies in Italy Before

FEDERAL INQUIRY MADE
Scheme Said to Be Backed
by the Steamship Lines
in Violation of the Law
WABHINGTON. Nov. T. â \u25b2 novel
scheme has* been brought to the attention
of the : immigration authorities ', to Induce
immigration from foreign countries to the
United ;\u25a0 Statos. Thus far the plan is
known to ibo In operation only In : Italy,
but It probably will be extended to Â©th.tr
Biuropsan , countries.
' Two companiss, known respoetively a*
"Unlono Meridionals)" and "La Llgur*
Americana," have been organized to laaus
to ; prospective immigrants policies of In
suranca' that . they Â» will be landed on " ar
rival In America. The premium charged
for each policy is $3, the companies i guar
anteeing to refund the Immigrant's trans
portation charge ! In ' tho . event of * his de
portation from this ; country.' A , number
of v steamship lines ;' are ; reported ' as the
sponsors : for. tho ' insurance . companies.
' The matter has been Investigated by
the law officers of the Immigration bu
reau and an opinion has .bean rendered
that the scheme is *in violation of ex
press legislative , provisions.' It is held
that under .the law steamship companies
may, not offer anything in the way. of in
ducement to â¢ encourage " immigration to
the United ; States. What >; action will bo
taken by. the Government authorities has

Floating Globe, Collapsible
Lifeboat Jand Gasoline Mo
tor-Boat AM Do; Good Diity
In his crÂ«at battl* with thÂ« \u25a0â¢Â«, , *
battle which never 'ends,' man has dis
played much Ingenuity. .While realiz
ing that the foe will always be too
strong: for him. he never relaxes :- his
efforts ; to j make ocean voyaging: as free
from dang-er as possible. Captain J. M.
Donvlar, a Norwegian shipmaster, haa
invented a, floating 'globe which - has
undergone repeated tests successfully.
This, - globe, oapable of holding sixteen
persons, may be amply provisioned,
watered â¢ and .' supplied â¢ with fresh -'-'} air.*
It '\u25a0\u25a0 is % claimed top be *c absolutely .</ non
sinkable, floating on the surf ace of _\u25a0 the
wildest sea. -In his globe Captain Don
vlg has ; utilized 2 the " principle ot the
hollow .ball that floats readily upon the
water.'S^a^s^B^^E : ; :--' : . - '.'i^fflÃl
The shell Is constructed of steel and
is braced sufficiently to make it strong
enough to withstand the battering of
angry, waves, .or ;> even / pounding;, upon
rocks or the shore. It is so constructed
that the C part intended to be the ; top
wlll'^ always ' float \u25a0 uppermost In - part
the ballast consists of two large tanks,'
each capable, of holding 250 gallons of
fresh water. Seats for passengers that
encircle": the interior are built .over
lockers,Sln,whichra considerable quan
tity, of food; may be stored.
the top of -the globe is a twelve
inch ventilating, pipe, - which may'\bÂ«
raised to a height of five" .feet' or low
ered so as to: be flush with the router
surface of the globe. ; There are; three
manholes by. which a passenger ; may
enter or, leave the globe, and through
small glass portholes \the outer * sur
roundings lof ; the globe may *be -i] ob
served. ;, The interior contains toilet ac
commodation and -cooking appliances,
so that, with fresh - water, warm food
and /dry, If ;'; somewhat : cramped, quar
ters castaways may : manage to pass
the time in more: or less comfort un
til â¢ rescued or the - globe drifts ashore.
Completely, fitted \u25a0 out and ! containing
sixteen persons, : the; life-saver draws
twenty-three i Inches of water.
When caught; in a collision, passen
gers and crew of a ship have only to
climb, into life-saving : globes, close the
manholes. [ and,' .without fear, wait * for
their vessel \u25a0 to \ sink. ;No matter how
great" the suction. Captain Donvlg as
serts, - the ; glob es will bob , to the sur
face serenely ; and : right side up/.
By- displaying a flag by day. and dis
charging rockets at night he would ex
pect to ; be picked up without great de
lay, unless the .wreck occurred far out
of the usual lines of sea travel:
- COLLAPSIBLE LIFEBOAT.
: A: marine engineer, of a neighboring
nationâ Captain ' Engelhard t of Den
markâhas just .invented a collapsible,
non-sinkable , lifeboat, which, .when not
in use,* may be folded and- stowed away
in much less i space than is required for
the ordinary boats aboard a ship. The
operation of extending or. opening it Is
very: simple, requiring only; a*few/mo
ments. A" boat of such a \u25a0 type, * twenty
feet long,; even, when", filled/with /'.'water,'
will, . it \u25a0is - asserted, sustain more \u25a0 than
4000 pounds, and : one .twenty-six'; feet
long-will float 8000 pounds.' ;\u25a0 \u25a0-;\u25a0; ';\u25a0'.
The ; great buoyancy,, of; Captain En
gelhardt's craft is due to the fact that
its and ? fender 'are ; filled with
kapok, the product ".'of iajplant'i that
grows In Java and ; Sumatra. â¢â¢ It .will
sustain from thirty to. thirty-flve. times
its own; weight in .waterâ seven and a
half timesthe buoyancy of "cork.'; y*"-
When; not in luse ? the "superstructure
of the boat mayibe folded down.; When
erect Sthe superstructure^ is surrounded
by a ; fender, also } filled -.with kapok |in
.water-tight cushions. -'ln extending. the
boat; the oars are /released, fan "oval
shaped :thwarf Biipplied -.- with /cross
thwarts slides into position and stanch
lons y and other : parts â¢ drop \u25a0 into Iheir
places \ automatically.' - The mechanism
is simple, and not put out of or
der, v-;-\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0. v \u25a0\u25a0' \u25a0'â¢\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0
7lt Is asserted that this boat would be
serviceable even with; its; sides, torn,'; its
plugs lost and its. bottohv crushed. -Be
ing > less- than -a^ ; foot lrivdepth * when
folded," It may easily be stowed. ; Heavy
seas are 'not likely .to . injure Ith', Fur
thermore, it Is always '; ready. .'; Should a
vessel with such an 'â¢'-; equipment ',' sink
suddenly, ; the lifeboats 'would? float as
rafts and " still support ; their [ full com
plement of ' . â¢ '-'â¢\u25a0\u25a0
Captain Englehardt's boat Is /very
easy to launch. . If v the ; davits ;- : are
Jammed, It : may. be ithrown ; overboard
bodily,- and be manned and extended

Who is there among us that has
never seen a lake, a pond or a river bed
laid "Jdry^ that: has not '[ felt an almost
childish Interest ; and . curiosity In the
aspect of a portion of the eaxth's sur
face hlthnrto concealed from our gaze?
The ; feeling is probably universal, aris
ing from the natural desire to pene
trate the unknown, -and also from a
primitive anxiety to know what sort of
an ,; abode the - Inhabitants of the . water
possess, - sine* we almost . always con
sider the water folk to live as do the
birds, really on land with the water for
an ' atmosphere.
But if this ourioulty be so general
with regard to the petty depths : men
tioned above how ; greatly is - It I In-"
creased In respect of. the recesses of the
sea. For , there is truly.- the ' great un
known, the undlsooverable . country, of
which, in spite of , the constant, efforts
of I deep-sea , expeditions,: we ) know next
to nothing. Here imagination may (and
does) - run ' riot,' attempting the impos
sible ; task of reproducing to our minds
the state of things In the* Ugbtless, si
lent depths, where life, according to
our ideas of it. is impossibleâ tha true
valley of the shadow of death.
IF ATLANTIC WKIIK DRY.
. Suppose that it were 'possible for some
convulsions of nature ' to lay bare, let us
Bay, the entire bed lof the North Atlantic
Ocean.' "With one bound the fancy leaps
at : the - prospect \u25a0of a rediscovery -of the
lost continent, the fabled Atlantis, whose
wonders have . had bo ? powerful an : effect
upon : , the V imaginations of \u25a0 mankind.
Should we be able to roam through those
stupendous halls, climb . those towering
temple heights reared by the giants of
an I elder 7; world or gaze ' with stupefied
wonder upon the majestic ruins of cities
to which ; Babylon or Palmyra, with all
their mountainous 'ediflcep,; were but as a
suburban towhlet? Who \ knows? Yet
maybe > the' natural wonders apparent ' In
the foundations 'of 'such 'soaring masses
as the Azores,;' the \ Cape Verde ' Islands , or
the -Canaries, /or,^greater still," the alti
tude of such remote and lonely pinnacles
as those ' of" the * St. ; Paul '-. Rocks, ; would
strike us as more, marvelous yet.

country, â¢ where -It -has been - applied to
a \u25a0 lifeboat for the use ' of regular life
saving stations. < .
The motor is intended to relieve the
crew ; from the - arduous ; labors entailed
in approaching a -wreck against heavy
seas and ? head \u25a0 winds. ' Sometimes life
savers and ;' those r whom they ;' are en
deavoring to; rescueimeet; death in the
surf ', because '- the \u25a0 men * have been ex
hausted ; by- the .terrific strain of bat
tling with ; the -seas. ;
MOTOR-DRIVEN LIFEBOAT.
- An 'experimental - motor-driven . life
boat : has been put into service at New
haven If or this winter. It* is expected
that : all the important : stations of the
British * coast .will ; soon be equipped
with such craft.
â Before adopting the gasoline motor
into the ; lifeboat service many " difficul
ties ; were surmounted.. In the first
place,' it; was Imperative that the motor
be 'adequately; protected from the vio
lence, of the \ waves that -are constantly
shipped.; :To attain : such; an end; it was
found necessary to . inclose ' the '; engine
in an absolutely; water-! tight \u25a0 case.' -,- ; ;
Then ' again I the ; motor , had to . be \as
n early, automatic as possible. .But what
was ." far more ; Important â¢ was . that i the
lifeboat should - not ; lose > its ' ability to
right 1 itself of the weight â¢ and
position of the machinery, and also that
the~motor should stop; automatically in
the ? event ?of \ the : boat ; being capsized.
All '-\u25a0 these requirements; \u25a0 It ' Is \u25a0 asserted, .
have been ? met In the craft Just put
Into - service . at Newhaven. ;
\u25a0 M. "\u25a0; Probst: a native {of \ Geneva, , has
Invented a : new; life-saving costume.
Dressed in it; he has remained fifteen
days at sea. 'There ) is : no " limit to ; the
time; this; ne^ life-saving apparatus
may be \ worn. '.; ;.
It' is made of India , rubber, and : can
easily be put * oni It is water-tight; and
covers all but the hands f and f ace. TSo
light Is it nearly half the Ibody
remains >y above 'r;. water. ',:'> Ingeniously
made water-tight -pockets /contain v the

which to repelthe attacks of large fish,

view, this suddenly exposed floor of the
sea. A barren land "of weird outline,
of almost unimaginable complexity of
contour, but without any. beauty such
as ils 'bestowed upon the dry earth by
the kindly sun. For, its beauty depends
upon the sea, whose prolific -waters are
peopled with life so abundantly that
oven the teeming _ earth is barren' as
compared .with the : ocean. But . at its
greater; depths all the researches that
man has; been able to prosecute go
to provo.that there is little life. The
most that goes on there is the steady
accumulation of the dead husks of once
living: organisms settling slowly down
to form who knows what' new granite
marbles, porphyries, against the tim*.
when another race on a reorganize^
earth shall need them. . *
LAND OXCE SUBMERGED.
Here there is nothing fanciful, for if we
know anything *at all of prehistoric times
it is that what is now high : land, not to
say merely, dry, land, was onco lying cold
and dormant at the bottom of the. sea,
being prepared throughout, who can say
what unrealizable periods of time, for
the use and enjoyment of its present
lords. Not until we leave the rayless
gloom, the incalculable pressures and .uni
versal cold of those tremendous depths
do we find the sea floor beginning to
abound with life. It may even be doubt
ed whether anything of man's handiwork,
such as there is about a ship floundering
in mid-ocean, would ever reach In a rec
ognizable form the bottom of thÂ© sea at
a depth ' of more than 2000 fathoms.
. DERELICTS OP THE DEEP.
There is an idea popularly current
among seafarers that sunken ships in the
deep sea only go down a certain distance,
no matter what -their build or how pon
derous their \u25a0> cargo. Having - reached /a
certain stratum they then drift about,
slowly disintegrating,, derelicts of the
depths, swarming with strange denizens,
the shadowy fleets of the lost and loved
and : mourned. In time,'; of course, , as the
great solvent gets In its work. they dis-"
appear, becoming part of their surround
ings, but not ; for hundreds , of years, dur
ing which they pass and repass at the
will of the undercurrents that everywhere
keep the whole body of water in the
ocean from becoming stagnant and death
dealing to adjacent ; shores.
KIPLING'S POEM.
A weird fancy, 'truly, but surely not
more strange than the silent depths
about which it is formulated.
In his marvelously penetrative way
Kipling has touched this \u25a0 theme while
singing the "Song of the English":
The dissolve above us; their
dust drops down from, afar â ;
Down to the dark, the utter dark,
where the blind white sea snakes
;- are.
There is no sound, no echo of sound,
' in the deserts of the deep.
On the great gray level plains of. ooze
where the shell-burred cables
creep. .
Here in the womb of, the world, here on
w the tie-ribs of earth. /
"Words, and the words of men, flicker
; . and flutter, and beat.
Warning, sorrow and- gain, salutation
and mirth.
For a power 'troubles the . still that
has neither voice nor. feet.
- âPhiladelphia Ledger.

Dried Fruits In N>Â« YorlC
I^ate mail advices from New York says:
. '"A fairly active market for Calilornla dried
v fruits on the spot yesterday was reported by
the broker*, but none of them seemed to have
aecurÂ«-d any larce orders. The demand was
larcely for rrunes and raisins, with a talr
ei>rlukl;nÂ« of orders for apricots and a few
lor i>eaches. A small proportion of the sales
w*c*> Tor forward shipment from the coast,
buy< rs' ohlef concern at present eeemlng to be.

more pressirur wants until the arrival of gtock
bought for shipment Horn the coast and now
rolling. Shipmtnt* are coming forward Elowly
owirg to ihe scarcity of cars en the coaet, and
Â»va:labie Â«j].j iits on the spot are small. Con-
Mqneatljr the market Is very firm. There eeeme
to lÂ« little demand for California raisins for
ehixment Ircra the coast, but outside seeders
do not appear to be anxious' to socura further
orders at ureseut. Spot coasrt. Â»eÂ«led raisins
are ivLiresc-nted to be iv very good demand,
with sales of new <-roi> at 9c for outtide and
!<*i-c for combination brands, but the supply
is limited. Old crcp and city needed raisins
are tellinx well at the quotations. Currants
â¢jj-e active and the market firm."
The Weather and- Crop*.
The 'weekly report of A. G. McAdie, section
dheotor or the climate and crop service of â¢
the Weather Bureau, is as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
Clear and warm weather continued most
oi the week, with heavy logs in the central
coa^t districts. High northeriy winds pre
vailed at the close of the week and heavy
rain fell In Southern California on Sunday.
The precipitation at San Diego for twenty
lour hour* was I.CS inches and at Los An
geles 0.5S of &n inch.
Oranges are somewhat backward In Southern
California, but picking has commenced in some
places. In the Portervllie and Oroville dis
tricts orange harvest is in progress and ship
ments are beir.g made to local and Eastera
rnarkpu. The outlook Is good for an. excel
lent crop. Orange Ehipments from Southern
C&iifcrr.ia for the season just closed amounted
to ;;o,wn> carioadE. A good crop of olives Is
being harvested. The apple crop is nearly all
gathered and U one ot the best ever grown
in the Stale. Grape harvest, raisin making
and truit drying are practically completed and
wine making is nearly finished. Taken as a
whele the yields of deciduous fruits and grapes
have been very eatistactory. Walnut picking
aad fchiprtng continue: the nuts are of good
vtuaiity. but the yield is lees than average
in most places.
The soil has become so dry and hard in
Eome sections that plowing and seeding have
b*-en suspended but farm work still continues
in other section's. Main la badly needed In the
central and northern districts, both tor soften
ing the soil and to Etart pasturage, which is
rapidly failing. The rain in Southern Cali
fornia was of immense benefit to orchards,
ranches ard pasturage. The -hay and grain
crops are unaer cover and harvest is about
completed on coi-iv *cans, potatoes and cugar ,
beets.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.â Warm and dear
weather continued during the week, with brisk
northerly winds. The dry winds caused no
material damage and the warm days were
beneficial to citrus truits. Oranges are color
ing rapidly and will econ be ready for pick
ing; the prospect is Rood for an excellent
crop. Gra.t>e shipments are practically com
pleted and dried fruits are mostly secured.
Olive picking is In progress and a good crop
is being gathered. Bean harvest Is completed.
Plowing and seeding are in progress. The
f-oil has become very dry and rain is needed.-
Stock is doing fairly well on dry feed, but
ijasiurage is rapidly falling.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.â Dense fogs
prevailed in the bay district at the beginning
of the week, with generally clear and warm
weather In the Interior. Light fogs occurred
in some sections. High northerly winds pre
vailed at the close of the week. In some
Sections farming operations have been eus
}.ended, owing to the dryness of the soil, but
plowing and seeding are In progress in other
I <laces. Feed is scarce and rain is needed in
all sections. Beans, alfalfa, corn and potatoes
Â».:â¢* nearly all secured and the hay and grain
\u25a0 crops are under cover. Grapes and deciduous
traits are mostly disposed of. An excellent
crop of apples has been gathered and large*- :
shipments are being made. Cloverdale or
anges are in good condition. Tree pruning
la in progress.
PAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.â CIear, warm
days and cool nights prevailed during the
rast -week. Light frosts occurred on several
morning*, but did no damage. Wloe making
:s about over for the season. Olive picking
If progreesSng and a large crop will be har- :
vested. . Oranges are making good growth and
picking and shipping are progressing; a large
crop of excellent quality will be harvested.
Orchards sre being pruned in come sections.
In the northern portion of the valley dry plow
ing and seeding continue. Dry feed Is ,Xalr
and etock Is healthy and generally In Â£ood
condition. Rain is badly needed for rreea"
feed and farming operations. t- Jr '
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. â Warm ,/and
clear weather prevailed during the iflrÃt of
the" weeK. with some fog In the coaet dis
tricts. .High winds and sandstorms prevailed
Sunday followed by phenomenally heavy rain
fall. At Los Angeles the precipitation for
twenty-four hours was 0.5S of an Inch and at
Ban Diego I.CS inches. The rain caused some
flamatre to streets and railroads, but In other
respects was exceedingly beneficial, as the soil
had become very dry and pasturage was fail
leg. Apple picking and fruit drying are
iij-acticaliv completed and walnut Harvest is
progressing. The yf*ld of honey Is larger
than that cf last eeason and heavy shipments
are beicg made. Late tomatoes are being
â¢hipped East from Anaheim. Citrus fruits
are In pood condition In most places and or
anse picking has commenced.
EUREKA SUMMARY.â Unusually dry
weÂ»thÂ«r continues and dairy Interest* are be
licnlns to feel the long drought. Farmers are
L plowing and CXzt&ng potatoes.
* LOS ANGELES SUMMARY.â A general rain
â¢t the clOFe of the we+k caused farm work to
proceed rapidly. A large acreage Is being
â¢#Â«-dÂ«5 to grain. An unusually heavy bean
crop In most sections 1Â« safely harvested.
Packing-houses are busy handling lemons.

STORY OF THE SHIPWRECK
OF STEAMER AMERICAN"
Lout In 18S0 on Llbertan Coast Wfclle
They Are Bound (or
' . Australia.
The story of the shipwreck ot the steam
er American, which ran between England
and South Africa, reads ' like a chapter
from Frank Stockton. When day broke;
on the morn ins of April 23. 13S0. the*
steamer . .was . close' to . the equator . and
about 100 or 150 miles from the Liberia a
coast. Suddenly In the first morning
watch, between 5 and 6 o'clock, there was
a fearful crash in the engine-room, fol
lowed by a concussion against the ship*
side, whicJ* for an Instant suggested that
she had struck a rock. Half-dressed pas*
senders hurried on deck and eagerly in
quired what had happened, but were met
in the coolest possible manner by Captain
Walt and Mr. Hep worth, second officer,
who assured them that It was merely, a
breakdown of some part of the machin
ery. The passengers returned to their
cabins. The propeller shaft had broken
in the stern tube and had burst open thÂ«
side of the ship. There was no hope â¢Â£
savins the steamer.
"It means the boats," Captain Walt re
marked, "but she will float for a few
hours yet, so we will get the passengers
into the saloon and have breakfast
served^* This was promptly done,' and
Captain Wait took his usual place 'ln bis
usual cheerful manner, while Mr. Hep
worth and the crew busied themselves In
getting the ship's boats ready. Aftsr
breakfast . Captain Wait mentioned In
manner so cool as to be almost casual that
the accident had damaged the ship's ltd*
a good deal and that therefore It wa Set
ter to be prepared for any emergency.
The passengers, when they were ready*
took their places In the boats. Quickly,
but methodically and without ; the teart
hurry, the- eight boats, which were provi
sioned and manned, were filled, and whÂ«&
every other person had been safely passed
over the side Captain Walt left his sbi9
and Joined his crew and passengers. Very
shortly after, about noon, the American
was seen to sink. \u25a0
Captain Walt divided his little floilUaf
Into two sections. Of the first he himself
took charge/ and Hepworth became
responsible for the other. . The part of "tJie
sea where the. American went down wai,
of course, in the Immediate track of num
bers of sailing ships and steamers, but as
it was also very close to. the LJberlan
coast it 'was decided to make for the lat
ter. During the first night at sea the lit
tle flotilla became separated. On the fol
lowing day Captain Wait and' two of Wst
boats were picked np by a brig, wfcifca
took them to Grand Basaa. thence ,to
Sierra Leone. ' where' they were trans
ferred to a steamer called 'the' Senegal,
then on her way to England. ;
Curiously "enough, the Senegal on her
voyage home was stranded on an lslasd
of the Grand Canaries, so that some of
the American's passengers had a aecoiwL
unpleasant experience before getting back
to England. In the meantime Mr. H#p-_
worth's boat and two others made for the
Siberian coast, which they reached on the
third . day." In t consequence of the surf,
however; '\u25a0 they . found It -. impossible t<>;
land, tp they headed out to sea again and
two days later were picked up by a
steamer, called the Congo, and â taken. to
Tenerlff e . 1 thence to Madeira and ; from
there, to England.
â¢ This left only the gig and the dingey tÂ»
be accounted for. The former waa heard
of in a" few , weeks, but when nearly
twelve -months had gone by and tha
eighth and smallest boat of them all still,
remained missing the worst wad feared.

CLEVER WOMAN'S SUSPICIONS UNCOVER ANDREWS' HIDING PLACE
3Hlton Franklin Andrews' hiding place at 745 McAllister street, where he shot/Ms com])anioh ?^ldaPetrie; and himself when trapped Monday night by the police, was uncovered through the keenness
of Mrs 31 B. Hornbeck. a shopkeeper, across the street! Nulda Petrie traded there. She appeared bneday with her hair bleached and wearing; black goggles. Her peculiar actions aroused Mrs. uorn
beck whose spouse was persuaded to call in Policeman; Burke, who followed the- clew.
Consort Unwittingly Betrays
; Her Lover to Police.
Assumes , Peculiar Disguises
in Preparing to Else.
Powerful in its intense dramatic Inter- j
Â«st as was the tragedy which ended the}
lives of the hunted Milton Franklin An-i
drew* and his beautiful consort Nulda
Petrte. Monday night at their lodgings,
' 74S McAllister street, where the police had
surrounded the fugitives, the chapters
unfolded yesterday in the remarkable
story of crime heighten the lurid colors
cf the tragedy.
"When the police ef_ four States, trailing
back and forth across the continent, and .
into the faraway Isles under the South- j
em Cross, had failed to find the man who |
â¢was accused of three murders, c keen
eyed and nimble witted little woman in
6an Francisco caught the clew that led
to the undoing of the fleeing pair. Upon
Mrs. M. D- Hornbeck. who helps her
. husband In a modest grocery and bakery
at 7*3 McAllister street, falls the mantle
of success in gaining the knowledge that
carried the police detectives to the An
drews hiding place, where the cornered
fugitive gave up his own life and that of
his woman companion before he would
â¢yield to the call of the law officers.
WOMAX'S WIT YVIXS.
That a clever woman's ready Intuition
was responsible for the direction to the
police is due to another woman's over
anxiety to conceal her real self from the
world. \u25a0
It was, perhaps, a case of setting a
woman to catch a woman, although the
retiring little shopkeeper had slight
Idea when she evolved -her plan that it
â¢would le&d to such a startling climax as
was furnished by the desperate Andrews.
Perception which curiosity might have
sharpened was the dominant element in
the moves that Mrs. Hornbeck followed
before the culmination was- reached.
\u25a0 Strangely enough Nulda Petrie. in her ef- ',
forts at" disguise, really betrayed herself '\u25a0
In the eyes of the shopkeeper's wife.
Andrews and his companion, so the
evidence points, were hard pressed. They
had flown from Berkeley after the mur
derous attack on William Ellis, the Aus
tralian horseman. Dragged by a relent
. less fate from hiding place to hiding
place they at last settled on a suite . of
dingy housekeeping rooms in the home
of James B. Meagher, where the pair's
existence ceased.
: Here they began their preparations for
â¢ : flight. They had come directly to this
city in the hoi>e and belief that for a
short whi o they might keep safely under
cover until the excitement over the Ellis
case should have been allayed in course
of time. Then they would again take up
the wearisome journey and try to elude
detective pursuers. This is where Nulda
Petrie made her fatal mistake. For sev
eral days after taking the rooms at
Meagher's under pretense that she was
an Eastern tourist no change was noted
in the appearance of the darj*-haircd
young woman who bought many articles
for the table at the little grocery across
the street. Suddenly the newdomer called
at the store on a domestic mission, this
a few days after ehe had begun to trade
there, and Mrs. Hornbeck, vigilant as
usual, observed that her steady customer
was changed.
PEXETRATES DISGUISE.
It was no difficult task on the part of
the ehoÃwoman to discover what bad
caused the change. After some study
Mrs. Hornbeck satisfied herself that the
\u25a0woman was attempting to hide her i
identity by bleaching her former very
dark glossy hair to a light reddish brown.
And about the time this difference was
noticeable the pretty little woman from
across the way began to Â«wear larga,
heavy dark goggles.
This was another item that caught
Mrs. Hornbeck's attention, and she did
not fall to remember these peculiarities
In her mysterious customer who came ',
and went with such regularity from the
rooms at th* Meaghers'. There were
other Incidents that cropped up as the ;
days rolled on. Mrs. Hornbeck, shrewd- i
ly Interested, noticed that her daily caller i
bought large quantities of^bread," milkj
and eggs, quantities out of all proper
tlon to the ordinary needs of one woman I
at light housekeeping.
STJSPICIOXS ARISE.
Nearly three weeks passed, and
these little odds and ends began to de
velop Into a. large-sized idea that all
â¢was not right with the Meaghefs'
lodger. Suspicion seized the little shop
keeper. The more she pondered over
the comings and goings of that lodger
from Meagher's the more she became
satisfied there was something for In
vestigation. The subject soon became
one of general gossip in the store. At
last Mrs. Hombeck, unwilling longer to
shoulder the responsibilities of the self
accepted burden of mental worry, in
formed her husband of her suspicions.
Hornbeck was inclined to chaff his
spouse about her unusual disturbance
of mind. This only Increased her fervor.
Eornbeck mu*t go to the police. But.
like a great many others In this world,
the' name of police was repugnant to
her. The couple considered carefully.

and finally decided to report the strange
occurrences to their friend. Policeman
M. V. Burke. There' were two objects '
In placing the' facts before him. Horn
beck had conceded to his wife. He went
to Friend Burke tfnd laid the facts be
fore that ofti^tr and Patrolman Fred
Smith. Burkes working partner.
Thus. did the tragedy open in the
quiet neighborhood where for three
weeks Andrews and his consort buried
themselves* while they prepared far
their flight far away from the scene of
the brutal robbery and slugging of tho
man they had lured to California from
his home in Australia for the sake of
his gold.
Mrs. Hornbeck very quietlybut firm
ly deprecates any unusual prominence
in connection with the disclosures. She
trembled at the thought of the noto
riety which must follow.
Not until after the police had taken
a firm grip on the case did the thought
arise among: them that the man and
the woman they were trying:, to locatÂ«
for the Kills attack and the Bessie
Bouton murder, might be Andrews and
his peroxide beauty.
| j â¢% MRS. HORXBECK'S STORY.
That the woman was not what she
had represented herself to be seemed
a certainty. And Sirs. Hornbeck adds:
"There was really nothing in the
whole matter. Sly husband is away a
great deal on business, and I become
\u25a0well accuainted with many of our cus
tomers. In'any .neighborhood the, aa- t
rival of new people attracts attention.
I suppose I have my bump of curiosity
as well ' developed as any of my other
faculties. â¢ . .
"But one cannot help observing per
sons as they come Into the store,' and
I did observe this woman." My atten
tion was first attracted; to her by the
quantity, of bread she purchased â often
as high as five 'or six loaves a 4a 4 day/ We
could not Understand what she couW
be doiui.' with such a number, of loaves.'
She bought milk.. eggs and. other "sup
pJies in like quantity. She Â«ame and
went alone, and we knew she. was sup- i
posed to live alone I across the street,
at the Meajjhers*. .
"With attention thus directed to her i
at the outset of her visits to the store, j
it was more closely centered when, a i
few days after her first call, her near- \
ly blackâ very dark brown hair at I
least â had suddenly changed to a
li?bt reddish, that so plainly Indicated
its artificial source that we could not
help commenting.
WEARS BLACK GOGGLES.
"Then came the black goggles, and
the evident attempt at disguise was
coifplcd with a certain mystery that
save rise to all sorts of speculation. My
husband and myself decided that theru
was something in the wind that de
manded police inauiry. ' He was an old
friend of Policeman Burke, and my
husband went to him with the story
of this, bleached hair and goggles.
"At the time the Ellis case -did not
occur to us, but as soon as Burke, and
the other policeman took hold the sus
picion grew that here might be the mun
and the woman about whom' so much
had been published.
"Those are the facts" so far as I was
concerned. I. regret the, terrible .out-

It had . not been Intended -that the J
name of Mrs. Hornbeck should be linked
with the disclosures which, culminated in \u25a0
the tragedy at the Meagh'ers'. But" In the

That means Ellis will levy on the two,
diamond rings which were found on 'An
drews and the woman. ThÂ© jewels ara
said to be worth, respectively, $600 and
$100. There is also $135 in money. Th<j
comparatively small amount of coin the,
pair had left is indication that they werÂ«
in straits when the robbery of E1113,0c-Â»
curred, and thi3 tends to confirm his re-J
latlon to the affair and to. contradict An
drews' declarations that hie did not have
to steal, being well supplied with funds.
Ellis yesterday afternoon identified 4
pistol holster that held Andrew's re
volver with which the fugitive killed
himself. Ellis also said the pistol was
very like one he had seen in Andrews'
possession. Coroner Leland has not set
the date for the inquest.
RECORD IX THE EAST.
Little by little details of the life o{
Andrews are coming to light. From Hart
ford. Conn., yesterday was sent a dis
patch, which reads:
Milton Franklin Andrews formerly lived in
this city and spÂ«nt"the greater part of his earty
life here. -Andrews, the Hartford police be
lieved, was responsible for the death of a gam
bler named Bosworth In New Britain about a
year asco. Search was made, but Bosworth' s
murderer was never found. A man answering
Andrews' description was seen In New Britain
shortly before the Bosworth murder and a
friend of Andrews was positive that hÂ«Â» saw
him there. His brother. Alvln E. Andrews.
lives In this city. Alvin Andrews thiÂ» after
â¢ noon. believing his brother to be dead, con
sulted an attorney to arrange for removal of
the body East and to take charge- of any prop
erty left.
From Holyoke, Mass.. is the following:
Milton Franklin Andrews. wbÂ» killed him
self and his companion. Jfulda Petrie. in Saa
Francisco last night, resided In thlÂ» city for
some time and was well known by the fre
quenters of poolrooma and similar resorts-

and took his own life In San Francisco
last evening., a rumor gained currency
in Oakland that the double tragedy
which was later enacted had, actually

ter of record that It was reported at
police headquarters and at the office of
The Call "In Oakland before 7 o'clock
that. Andrews had killed the woman
and himself. At 8 o'clock, an hour la
ter, the double crime was committed In
San Francisco.
Long before the detectives surround
ed the dwelling on McAllister street in
San Francisco, where Andrews and thÂ«
woman had taken refuge, the rumor
of the crime wasspreading in Oakland.
1 There was hardly a policeman or news
paper man in Oakland who had not
heard of the,, sudden ending of thÂ«
couple and it was common, property oi|
the streets and the principal topic of
conversation. When it was learned
this morning . that the ] double crims
was actually .committed an hour after
[it had been talked about, there was
I consternation among those who had
! heard the rumor.
Whether It was telepathy or some
other agency that started the rumor,
no one pretends to say. but police and
| citizens who heard â¢ it- more than an
hour before the commission \u25a0 of thu
murder and suicide are. to-day wonder
ing how.lt all came about and they aro
not attempting to offer explanations.
