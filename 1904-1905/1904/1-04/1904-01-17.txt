of freedom! but this, time the freedom
of others; carrying the fruits of their
own struggle back to the old land from
which they came," with the sword In

To think what he had missed !
e As ; Grafton , walked slowly . back,v an
officer was calling the roll of his com
pany under 'Â¦ the â¢ quiet, sunny ; hill; and
he stopped to ' listen. Now and {hen
there was no answer, and he went on
thrilled and saddened. The play was
endedâ this was 'war.. r , '"â¢'<Â¦ /
Â¦ Outside the camp,', the road was full
of half-angry, â¢bitterly disappointed In-
where the wounded lay â white, quiet,
uncomplaining. . ' â¢
And there a surgeon told him how the
wounded Â¦ had lain . there during the
fight singing; ; ' '/Â¦ *., v
, My country, 'tis of tbeÂ«!
And Grafton beat his hands together,
while his throat was full and his eyes
were full of tears. To think what ihe
had missed â to think what he;, had
missed! " . ' .
j He knew that national interest would;
center, in ; this regiment' of Rough Rid
ers: for every State in the /Union had a
son in its ranks,' and the' sons repre
sented", every, social element in the na
tional life.; Never was* there 'a, more
representative body pf men,' nor a body
of more varied- elements standing, all on
one and the same basis of American
manhood. He recalled how, at Tampa,
he had stood with the c61onel while the
regiment filed past, ; the colonel, mean
while, telling him about the menâ the
strong men, who made strong stories
for Wister and. strong pictures for
Remington. And ,the colonel had
pointed | with especial pridfe and affec
tion to. two boy troopers, who marched
at the head of his columnâ a Puritan
from Massachusetts and a . cavalier
through Virginia blood from Kentucky;
one'the^ion of a Confederate general,
the otherithe son of ,a Union generalâ
both beardless brothers In
arms, -anxl v fast becoming brothers at
heartâ Robert Sumner and Basil Crit
tenden. The colonel waved his" hand
toward the wild Westerners who fol
lowed them.
"It's odd to think Itâ but those two
boys are the fathers of the regiment."
And now that Grafton looked afojind
kÂ«atry â Chaffee's men. When he
reached the camp of the cavalry at the
foot of the hill again, a soldier called
his name as he passed â a grimy soldier
âand Grafton stopped in his tracks.
"Well, by God!"
, It was Crlttenden, who smiled when
he saw Grafton's bewildered face. Then
the Kentuckian, too, stared in utter
amazement at a black " face grinning
over Grafton's shoulder.
i "Bob!"- he said, sharply.
"Yessuh," said Bob humbly.
"What are you doing here 1" .
"Nothin 1 , ole cap'nâ Jes nothln 1 ," said
Bob, with the naivete of a child. "Jes
lookin'fer you."- â¢ â¢ \ >-
"Is that your negro?" ' A sarcastic
lieutenant was asking the question.
"He's my. servant, sir."
/ "Well, we, don't allow soldiers to take
their valets to the field."
"My servant at home, sir, I meant.
He came -of his own accord."
. , "Go find Basil?! .Crlttenden said to
Bob, "and if you can't find him," he
added in a lower tone, "and want any
thing,'come back here to me."
"Yessuh," said Bob, loth to go, but,,
seeing the lieutenant scowling, he
moved on down the road. ' 'Â¦'. -..
"I thought you were a captain," said
Grafton. Crittenden laughed.
"Not exactly^ .
"Forward," shouted the lieutenant,
"march!"
, Grafton looked Crittenden over.
; "Well, I swear," he said heartily, and,
as Crlttenden .moved, forward, .Grafton
stood -.looking, after him. . "A .regularâ I,
: do be^damned!"

ardice exceptional and the brave man
the rule,. but he, was not prepared for
Abe's coolness and humor. Never did
the Westerner's voice change, and
never did \,the grim half-smile leave his
eyes or his mouth. Once during the
fight he took off his hat
"How's my hair parted?" he asked,
quietly. ;
,,-A Mauser bullet had mowed a path
through . Abe's thick, upright hair,
scraping the skin for three inches, and
"leaving a trail of tiny red drops. Crit
tenden turned to look and laugh, and a
bullet cut through the open flap of his
shirt. Just over his heart. He polnte'd
to it.
"See the good turn you did me." "â¢
t Whjle the two were cooking supper.
'the old sergeant came up.
'"If you don't obey orders next time,"
he said to Crittenden, sternly, for Abe
was present, "I'll report you to the
captain.'?. Crlttenden had declined to
take shelter during the fight â it was a
racial inheritance that both the North
and the South learned to correct in the
old war.
. "That's right, governor," said Abe.
"The colonel himself wanted to know
what damn fool that was standing out
, in the road. He meant you."
"All right, sergeant," Crlttenden said.
When he came In from guard duty,
late that night, he learned that Baail
was safe. He lay down \yith a grate
ful heart, and his thoughts, like the
thoughts of every man in that tropical
forest, took flight for home.. Life was
getting very simple now for himâ
death, too, and duty. Already he was
beginning to wonder at his old self
and, with a shock.it came to him that
there were but three women in the
world to himâ Phyllis and his motherâ
and Judith. He thought of the night
of the parting, and Jt flashed for ,the
first time upon him that Judith might
have taken the shame that he felt red
dening his face as. shame for her, and
not for .himself, and a pain shot
through him so keen that he groaned
aloud.
Above hlrd wns a clear sky, a quarter
moon, an enveloping mist of stars," and
the very peace of heaven. But there
was little sleepâ and that battle-haunt
edâfor any; and for him none at all.
"There's one." said the colonel, with
a careless gesture. A huge buzzard
flapped from the tree over the dead
man as they passed beneath. Beyond
was the open-air hospital, where were
two more rigid human figures, and
Beyond was the camp of the regulars
who had taken part in the fight. On
one side stood a colonel, who himself
had aimed a Hotchkiss gun In the lit
tle battle â covered with grime and
eweat, and with the passion of battle
not quite gone from his eyes; and
across the road soldiers were digging
one lcr.g grave. Grafton pushed on a
little farther, and on the top of the
ridge and on the grassy sun-lit knoll,
Â¦was the camp of the Riders, just .be
yond the rifle-pits from which they
had driven the Spaniards. "Under, a
tree to the right lay another row of
muffled shapes, and at once Grafton
Â¦walked with the colonel to the . hospi
tal, a quarter of a mile away. The
path, thickly shaded and dappled with
sunshine, ran. along the ridge through
the battle-field, and it was' as pretty,
peaceful and romantic as a lovers' walk
in a garden. Here end there.; the tall
grass along the path was pressed flat
vhere a -wounded man had lain. In
one place, the grass was, matted and
dark red; near by was a blood-stained
hat marked with the initials "E. L."
Here was the spot where the first vic
tim of the fight fell. A passing soldier,
who reluctantly gave his name as
Blackford. bared his left arm and
showed the newspaper man three
places between his wrist and elbow
where the skin had been merely blis
tered by three separate bullets as he
lay fighting unseen enemies. Farther
on, lay a dead Spaniard, with covered
face.
"Still r.utty," said Grafton to himself.
Farther on was a camp af insurgents
âlittle, thin, brown fellows, ragged,
dirty, shoeless â each with a sugar-loaf
straw hat. a Remington rifle of the pat
tern of 1ES2. or a brand new Krag-Jor
genson donated by Uncle Sam, and the
Inevitable and ever ready machete
swinging in a case of embossed leather
on the left hip. Very young they were,
and very old; and w*lry, quick-eyed, in
telligent, for the most part and, in
countenance, vivacious and rather gen
tle. There was a little creek next, and,
climbing the bank of the other side,
Grafton stopped short, with a start, In
the road. To the right and on a sloping
bank. lay eight gray shapes, muffled
from head to foot, and Grafton would
have known that all of them were in
their last sleep but one, who lay with
his left knee bent and upright, his left
elbow thrust from his blanket, and his
hand on his heart. He slept like a
child.
X.
Â«^-r LREADT now. the first little
/ { fight was going on. and Graf
f"| ton, the last newspaper man
X ashore, was making for the
frontâ with Bob close at his heels. It
Â¦was hot, very hot. but the road was a
Kood. hard path of clean sand, and now
and then a breeze stirred, or a light
cool rain twinkled in the air. On each
Bide Jay marsh, swamp, pool and trop
ical jungleâ and. to Grafton's northern
imagination, strange diseases lurked
like monsters everywhere. Every
stranpe hot odor made him uneasy and
at time's he found himself turning his
head and holding his breath, as he al
ways did when he passed a pesthouse
In his childhood. About him were
strange plants, strange flowers, strange
trees, the music of strange birds, with
nothing to see that was familiar fcx
cept sky, mountain, running water and
tand; nothing home-like to hear but
the twitter of swallows and the whistle
of quail.
That path was no road Xor a hard
drinking man to travel, and. now, and
then, Grafton shrank back, with a star
tled laugh, from the hideous things
crawling across the road and rustling
into the cactusâ spiders with snail
houses over them; lizards with green
bodies and yellow legs, and green legs
and yellow bodies; hairy tarantulas,
scorpions and hideous mottled Hand
crabs. standing throe Inches. from the
pand. and watching him with hideous
little eyes as they shuffled sideways
into the bushes. Moreover, he was fol
lowing the trail of an army by the
cheerful signs In its wake â the debris
of the last night's campâ empty cans,
bits of hardtack, crackers, bad odors,
and. by anil by, odds and ends that the
soldiers discard as the sun got warm
and their packs heavy â drawers, un
dershirts, ooÂ»l, blankets, knapsacks,
an occasional gauntlet or legging, bits
of fat bacon, canned meats, hardtackâ
and a swarm of buzzards In the path,
in the trees, and wheeling in the airâ
and smiling Cubans picking up every
thing they could eat or wear.
An hour later he met a soldier, who
toid him there had been a fight. Still,
an hour later, rumors came thick, but
to conflicting and wild that Grafton be
gan to hope there had been no fiRht at
all. Proof met him, then, in the l >adâ
a white man, on foot, with his arm in a
bloody sling. Then, on a litter, a negro
trooper with a shattered leg; then an
other with a bullet through his throat;
and another wounded man, and an
other. On horseback rode a sergeant
with a bandage around his brow â Graf
ton could see him smiling broadly fifty
yards ahead â and the furrow of a Mau
ser ballet across his temple, and Just
under the skin.

with its flashes of crimson,- would pass
through the advancing columns amid
the waving of hats and a great cheer

dusk the columns marched, and, after
night fell, the dark, silent " masses of

âand sitting on the porch of the old
homestead at sunset of the last day in
June, the mother was following her
eldest born through the transport life,
the fiery marches;: the night watches
on outpp3ts, the'hard food, the
drenching rains, steaming, heat, laden
with^the breath of i terrible disease, not
realizing how 'little he minded it all
and, how; much good. it. was doing him.
She* did /- know, - however,' that it had

% There was to be a decisive fight in a
few days â the attack f on Santiago â
that was what Phyllis had read. The
Spaniards had a good muster-roll of
regulars and aid from Cervera's fleet;
were well armed and had plenty ' of
time to Intrench and otherwise prepare
themselves for a bloody fight In the last
ditch. . Â¦
So that each day there was a relief
to the agony, which, every morning,
began straightway with the thought
that the fight might be going on at
that very hour. Not once did Judith
come near. She had been ill, to be
sure, but one day Mrs. Crlttenden met
her on # the way to town and stopped
her in the road; but the girl had
spoken so strangely that the mother
drove on, at a loss to understand and
much hurt. Next day she learned that
Judith, despite her ill health and her
father's protests, had gone to nurse the
sick and the woundedâ what Phyllis
pleaded in vain to do. The following
day a letter came from Mrs. Critten
den's elder eon. He was well, and the
mother must not worry about either him
or Basil. He did not think there would
be much fighting" and, anyhow, the
great risk was from disease, and he
feared very little from thaV Basil
would be much safer as an aid on a
general's staff. He would get plenty to
eat, would be less exposed to weather,
have no long marche3 â as he would be
mountedâ and no j guard duty at all
hours of day and night. And, more
over,, he would probably be less con
stantly exposed to bullets. So she
must not worry about him. Not one
word was there about Judithâ not even
to ask how she was, which was
strange. He had said nothing abdut
the girl when he told his mother good
by; and wbefl she broached the sub
ject, he answered, sadly:
"Don't, mother; I fcan't say a word
not a word." \ ;
Phyllis picked â¢ up ' the paper then,
with . a cry of surpriseâ the name
signed to the article \ was Graf ton,
Â¦whom she had seen at the recruiting
camp. And then she read the last par.
agraph that the mother had not read
aloud, and then she turned sharply
away and stooped to 'a pink-bed, as
though she would pick one and the
mother saw her shoulders shaking with
silent sobs, and she took the child In
her arms.

"Yes," laughed Mrs. Crittenden.
"Tou can sat strawberries now. You
can balance them against his cocoa
nuts." - '".'Â¦".' .
Twanged Just then a bow string In
the direction of San Juan hill, and the
twang seemed to be getting louder *nd
to be coming toward the little blue
farm house. No cannon was in sight;
there was no smoke visible, and many,
with an upward look, wondered what
the cueer sound could be. Suddenly
there waa a screeching, crackling an-
Every ear s heard, every eye^saw the
sudden white mist at a guii muzzle and
fllowed that first shell screaming to
ward the little Christmas toy in the
sun on that distant little hilL And yet
it was nothing. Another and yet an
other mass of shrapnel went screaming,
and still there was no response, no
sign. It *wa3 nothingâ nothing at all.
"Was the Spaniard asleep? .
Crittenden could see attache, corre
spondent, aid, staff officer, non-comba
tant, sightseer crowding close about the
guns â so close that the gunners could
hardly work. He could almost hear
them saying, one to another:
"Why, is this warâ really war? Why,
this isn't so bad."
"Fire! 1 .'
Even with the cry at El Poso came
another, sullen, low boom and another
aggressive roar from Caney; then a
great crackling in the air, as though
thousands of schoolboys were letting
"off fire crackers, pack after pack.
Again Crlttenden, leaning against the
palm, heard his name called. Again it
was ' Blackford who was opening his
mouth to shout some message when â
Ah! The shout died on Blackford's lips,
and every man on the hill and .In tha
woods, at that Instant, stayed his foot
and his bandâ even a man standing
with a gray horse against the blue wail
âhe. too, stopped to- listen. It really
sounded too dull and muffled for a

was a roar against the big walls of

around a certain little gray stone fort

Eastward and on a high knoll stripped
of bushes, four 3.2 guns unllmbered
and thrown Into position against that
furt and a certain little red-roofed
town to the left of it. This was
Caney. . +
Rastward still, three miles across an
uneven expanse of green. Jungle-road
alive with men. bivouacking fearlessly
around and under four more 3.2 guns
planted on another high-stripped knoll
â El Poso â and trained on a little pa
goda-like block house, which sat Ilka a
Christmas toy on top. of a green little,
steep little hill from the base of which
curved an orchard-like valley back to
sweeping curve of the Jungle. This was
San Juan.
Nature loves sudden effects la the
tropics. While Chaffee fretted in val
ley shadows around Caney and Law
ton strode like a yellow lion past tha
guns on the hill and, eastward, gun
ner on the other hill at El Poso and
soldier In the Jungle below listened
westward, a red light ran Ilka a flame
over the east, tha tops of tha moun
tains shot suddenly upward and It was
day â flashing day, with dripping dew
and birds singing and a freshness of
light and air that gave way suddenly
when the sun quickly pushed an aro
of fire over tha green shoulder of a hill
and smote the soldiers over and under
the low trees like rays from an open
furnace.
It smote Reynolds as he sat by thÂ«
creek under the guns before San Juan.
Idly watching water bubble into three
canteens, and it opened his lips for an
oath that he was too lazy to speak; It
smote Abe Long cooking coffee on tha
bank some ten yards away, and made
him raise from the fire and draw first
one long forearm and then tha other
across his heat-wrinkled brow; but,
unheeded, It smote Crlttenden â who
stood near, leaning against a palm
tree â full in his uplifted face. Perhaps
that was the last sunrise on earth for
him. He was watching It In Cuba,
but his spirit was hovering: around
home. He could feel the air from the
woods in front of Cane wood; could
hear the darkies going to work and
Aunt Kezlah singing In the kitchen.
He could see his mother's shutter
open, could see her a moment later,
smiling at him from her door. And
Judithâ where was she, and what was
she doing? Could she be thinking of
. him? The sound of his own name com
ing down through the hot air made
him start, and, looking up toward the
Rough Riders, who were gathered
about a little stuccoed farm house just
behind the guns on the hill, ha saw
Blackford waving at him. At the
same moment hoofs beat the dirt road
behind him â familiar hoof beats â and
he turned to see Basil and BaJncrow â
for Crittenden's colonel waa sick with
fever and Basil had Ralncrow nowâ
on their way with a message to Chaffea
at Caney. Crlttenden saluted gravely,
as did Basil, though tha boy turned In
his saddle, and with an affectionate
smile waved back at him. .
Crittenden's lips moved;
: "God bless him."
"Fire!"
Over on the hill, befora Caney, a man
with a lanyard gave a quick Jerk.
There was a cap explosion at tha butt
of the gun and a bulging white cloud
from the muzzle: the trail bounced
from its shallow trench, tha wheels
whirled back twice on tha rebound,
and the shell 'was hissing through tha
. air as iron - hisses when a blacksmith
thrusts Â° It red-hot Into cold water.
Basil could hear that awful hiss so
plainly he seemed to be following
the shell with his naked eye; ha could
hear It abova tha reverberating roar
of the gun up and down tha coast
mountain; hear It until, six seconds
later, a puff of smoke answered be

shell burst. Then In eight secondsâ for

bursting struck bis ears, a^d all that
.was left of the first shot that started

jus' lay down heah little while," he
said, stretching out behind the trea.
And Grafton reached over for Crit
tenden's hand. He was getting some
new and startling ideas about the dif
ference In the feeling toward the negro
of the man who once owned him body
and soul and of the man who freed him
body and soul. And in the next few
minutes he studied Crittenden as he
had done beforeâ taking in detail the
long hair, lean face strongly chiseled,
fearless eye. modest demeanorâmark
ing the intellectual look of the face â It
was the face of a student â a gentleman
âgently born. And there, in the heat of
the fight. .he fell to marveling over the
nation that had such a man to send
into the field as a common soldier.
Again they moved forward.. Critten
den's lieutenant dropped â wounded.
Something serious was going to be
done nowâ the intuition of it ran down
the'line" in that' mysterious fashion by
which information passes down a line
of .waiting men. The line rose, ad
vanced, and dropped again. Companies
deployed to the left and behindâfight
ing their way through the chaparral as
a" swimmer^ buffets his way through
choppy waves. Every man saw now
thatthe brigade was trying to form in
line -of battle for a, charge on that
curving. . smokeless flame of flre that
ran to and fro around the top of the hill
âblazing fiercely and steadily here and
there. For^ half . an , hour the officers
struggled to form the scattered men.
Forward a little "way; slipping from
one bush and. tree to, another; through
the thickets . and bayonet grass; now
creeping; -now a., dash through an open
spot; ; now. flat on : the stomach, until
Crittenden saw a wire fence stretching
ahead. Followed another wait. And
then a squad of negro troopers crossed
the road, going to the right, and diag
onally. The bullets'rained'about, them,
and -they. -scuttled swiftly into the
brush. The hindmost one dropped: the
rest kept en, unseeing; but Crittenden
and last came Bob. The detail, passing
along the creek on the other bank from
them, scattered, and with Bob next the
creek. Bob shook his gun aloft.
'."I'can'wuk her now!"
Another lull . came, and from the
thicket arose the cry of a thin, high.
"Americano â Americano!"
â¢'"Whut. regiment you b'long to?" the
voice was a negro's and was Bob's, and
Grafton and Crittenden listened keenly.
Bob had evidently got a sharpshooter
up a tree, and caught him loading his
gun.
"Tenth Cav'rlyâ Tenth!" was the an
swer. Bob laughed long and loud.
'â¢Well, you jus the man I been lookin'
fer-^the fust white man, I ever seed
whut .'longed to a nigger regiment.
Come down, honey." There .was the
sharp, clean. crack of a Krag-Jorgen
soh, and a yell of savage triumph.
'â¢"That nigger's a bird," said Grafton.
Captain." Bob looked after the file of
colored troops, and Â¦ then at Crittenden.
"AH right, Ole 'Cap'n; I tol' you.in ole:

of a sword across Bob's back made him
jump. : . , ,
"What are you .doing here?"' thun
dered an angry officer. "Getjnto lineâ
get into' Hne.'* _
"I ain't^no eojer.? ._
"Get Into linej" and Bob ran after the
disappearing file, . shaking his 'head
helplessly. - ' . : .' : .
The crash started again, and the hum
of bees and the; soft- snap -of the. leaves
when' bullets clipped them like blows
wjthi a rattan cane, and the rattllnr
sputter of the machine j runs, and once
more came " that; long;, long wait that

he could see the tall doctor with" the
Â¦bare head helping, the -men -who -had
been, dressed, with a first-aid bandage

victims.' And 'as he. stood up' once,
.Crittenden Vsaw him throw his/ hand

blood-stained 'sand.' The assistant, who

shook his head to â¢ another, who .was

Looking behind, Crittenden had to
laugh. There was Bob, in a cavalry
man's.hat, with a Krag-Jorgehson in
his - hand, and an ammunition belt
buckled around him.
As he started toward Grafton, a lieu
tenant halted him.
"Why aren't you with your regi
ment?" he demanded sharply, Â»
"i;aln't got no regiment. I'se lookin 1
fer Ole Captain." â¢
"Get back into your regiment." said
the officer, with . an oath, and pointing
behind - to the Tenth ' Colored -Cavalry
coming up.
' "Huh!" he said, looking after -the
officer a moment, and then he came on
to the edge of the creek.
"Go to the rear. Bob," shouted 'Crit
tenden, sharply, and the next moment
Bob was crashing through the bushes
to the "edge of the creek.
"Foh Gawd, Ole Cap'n. I sutn'ly ,-iis.

V "Go back/ ' Bob," said Crittenden,
firmly.
"Silence in the ranks," roared a lleu
tenantl' Bob \ hesitated. Just" then' a
company of , the Tenth -.. Cavalry filed
down the road as they were deployed to
the right. Critteijden's file of soldiers
could see that the last man â¢ was / a
short, fat ' darky^-eyideritly "a recruitâ
and he was swinging along as jauntily
as in a cake walk. As he wheeled pom

A roar of ; laughter went down', the
bed of, the creek. .-.- â¢.". : . , \
, "Go back!"., repeated Crittenden,
threateningly, "and stop calling me Old
Grafton's face was.still calm â he was
still looking. - Presently he turned and
beckoned to somebody in the rear.
. "There he is, now."
"Well, by God," said Reynolds, Irri
tablyâthe bullet had gone through his
sleeve. "This ain't no timesto joke."
Reynolds, on his right, had ducked
quickly. Crittenden looked up in sur
prise. The South had no monopoly of
nerveâ nor, in that campaign, the sol
dier. ' -\ .
"That hit you?" he asked, -without
altering the tone of his voiceâ without
even lowering his glasses.
presently he rose and calmly peered
over the bank and at the line of yellow
dirt on the crest of the hill. A bullet
spat in the ground close by.
A lull came â one of the curious lulls
that come periodically In battle for the
reason that after any violent effort men
must have a breathing spellâ and Â¦ the
mist of bullets swept on to the, right
like a swift passing: shower of rain. :
There was a ' splash in â¢ the creek ! be
hind Crittenden, and some one fell on
his face behind the low bank with a
fervent: ; 'Â¦ ' Â¦.;"Â¦-.' f,.-(; "Â¦' â¢

was Grafton. v \
*;That nigger of yours is coming, on

And behind forged soldiers forward, a
tall aid at the ford urging them across
and stopping a panic among volunteers.
"Come back, you cowards â come
back! Push 'em back, boys!" .
A horse was orosslng the stream.
There was a hissing shriek in the air, a
geyser spouting from the creek, the
remnants of a horse thrown upward,*
and five men tossed In a swirl 'like
straw; and, a moment later, a boy fee
bly paddling toward the shoreâ while
the water ran past him red with blood.
And, through It all, looking backward,
Crittenden saw little Carter coming on
horseback, calm of face, calm of man
ner, with his hands folded over his
saddle, and his eyes looking upward
little Carter who had started out in an
ambulance that morning with a tem
perature of one hundred and four, and,
meeting wounded soldiers, gave up his
wagon to them, mounted his horse, and
rode into battleâ to come out normal at
dusk. And behind himâ ereot, proud,
face aflame,' eyes burning', "but" hardly
less coolâ rode Basil. , Crittenden's eyes
filled with love and pride for the boy.
"God bless himâ God save him!"
â¢ - â¢ â¢ -
And here and there, in the steady
pelt of bullets, went the quiet, brave
fellows with red crosses on their
sleeves; across the^creek, Crittenden
could see a tall, young doctor, bare
headed in the sun, stretching out limp
figures on the sand under the bank â
could see him and his assistants strip
pins, off blouse and trousers and shirt,
and wrapping and binding, and newly
wounded beinr ever brought in. . .
And not all of them passed high.
After that sweep of glistening steel
rain along the edge of the woods rose
the cry here, there, everywhere:
"Hospital man! hospital man!"
Ah, ye scornful veterans of the great
war. In ten minutes the Spaniard let
fly with his' Mauser more bullets than
did you fighting hard for two long
hours, and that one machine gun loosed
more death stings in an hour than did
a regiment of you in two. And they
were coming from intrenchments on an
all but vertical hill, from llles of un
limited ammunition, and from soldiers
who should have been as placid as the
earth under them for all the demorali
zation that hostile artillery fire was
causing them, . Â«
leaves down, patting into the Eoft eartlj
ahead, swishing to right and to left,
and at last playing in a steady stream
about the prostrate soldiers. .
"Swish-ee! Swish-ee! Swish-ee!"
"Whew!" said Abe Long.
VGod!" said Reynolds.
It had been a slow, tiresome march
up that narrow lane of death, and, so
far, Crittenden had merely, been
sprinkled with Mauser and shrapnel.
His regiment had begun to deploy to
the left, down the bed of a stream.
The negro cavalry and the Rough Ri
ders were deploying to the, right. Now
broke the storm. Imagine sheet after
sheet of hailstones, , coated with pol
ished steel, and swerved when close to
the earth at a sharp angle > the line of
descent, and sweeping the air horizon
tally with an awful . hissâ swifter in

"Take this road," he said. "I don't
know where that one goes, but I know
this one. I went up this one, and
brought back a souvenir," .he . added,
cheerily, shaking a bloody arm.
And everywhere men were caution
ing him to beware of the guerrillas, who
were in the trees, adding horror to the
scene â shooting wounded men on lit
ters, hospital men, doctors. Once, there
was almost the horror of a panic in the
crowded road. Soldiers answered the
guerrilla fire from the road; men came
running back; bullets spattered around.
Ahead, the road was congested with
soldiers. Beyond them was anchored
the balloon, over the Bloody Ford â
drawing the Spanish fire to the' troops
huddled beneath it. There was the
death trap/' 'd -'-.
And, climbing from an ambulance to
mount his horse, a little, bent old mam,
weak and trembling from fever, but
with his gentle blue eyes glinting: fire â
Basil's hero â ex-Confederate Jerry
Carter.
"Give the Tanks hell, boys," he
shouted. .
Another, hopping across -the creek on
one leg? â the other bare and wounded â
and uslnr his gun, muzzle down, as a
vaultlng-polei Another, with his arm
in the sling, pointing out the way.
At headquarters began the central
lane of death that led toward San Juan,
and Basil picked his way through it at
a Blow walkâ his excitement gone for
the moment and his heart Ireaking at
the sight of the terrible procession on its
way to the rear. Men with arms in
slings; men with trousers torn away at
the knee, and bandaged legs; men with
brow, face, mouth, or throat swathed;
men with no shirts, but a broad swathe
around the chest or stomach â each
bandage grotesquely pictured with hu
man fhrures printed to show how the
wound should be bound, on whatever
part of the body the bullet entered.
Men staggering along unaided, or be
tween two comrades, or borne on lit
ters, some white and quiet, some
groaning and blood-stained, some con-
Edous, some dying, some using a rifle
for a support, or a stick thrust through
the side of a tomato can. Rolls, ha
versacks, blouses, hardtack, bibles,
strewn by the wayside, where the sol
diers had thrown them before they
went into action. It was curious, but
nearly all of the wounded were dazed
and drunken in appearance, except at
the brows, which were tightly drawn
with pain. There was one man, with
short, thick, upright red hair, stumb
ling from one side of the road to the
other, with no wound apparent, and
muttering:
"Oh, I don't know what happened to
me. I don't know what happened to
me." Â¦
The advance had begun over there;
there was the main attack â the big bat
tle. It was Interesting and horrible
enough where he was, but Caney was
not Santiago; and Grafton, too,
mounted his horse and galloped after
BasIL
s'.ver in the air. the atmosphere was
rent ayart as by a lightning stroke di

horse by the blue wall dropped noise

Then they we:it d<Â»v.n tojrethTâ rap

And all the time the sound of ripping
doth was rolling over from Casey, the
far-away rumble "f wagons over cob
ble stor.es. or softened stage hail and
stapc thunder around the bl^ck house,
stone fort, and Unro. At first it was a
desultory fire, like the popping of a
bunch cf fire trackers that have to be
relighted several times, and Basil and
Grafton. galloping toward it, could
hear the hiss of bullets that far away.
But, now and then, the fire was ag
steady as a Galling gun. Behind them
the artillery had turned on the stone
fort, and Grafter. Â£uw one shot tear a
hole through the Spaniards .darting
from the foi t ar.d taking refuge in tha
encircling Ftcne-tut trenches; and then
n. thins elee â for their powder was
smokeless â except tlie f â hats of
the little devils in blue, who- blazed
away from their trenches around the
fort and minded the shells bursting
over and around them as littnj as
though they had been bursting snow
bails. If the boy ahead noted anything,
Orafton could not tell. Basil turned
his head neither to right nor left, and
at the foot of the muddy hill, the black
horse that he rod>, without touch of
*pur. seemed suddenly to leave the
ea:th c:nl pass en out of Eight with the
swift silence of>e shadow. At the foot
of a hill walked the first wounded man
â a colonel limping: between two sol
diers. The colonel locked up smilingâ
he had a terrible wound in the groin.
â¢Well." he culled cheerily, "I'm the
first victim."
Grafton vorcdered. Was it -possible
that men were Roing to behave on a
l>attle-ficld just as they did anywhere
elseâ just as naturallyâ taking wounds
and death and horror as a matter of
course? Beyond were more wounded â
the wounded who were able -to help
themselves. Soon he saw them, lying by
th* roadside, here and t-.ere a dead one;
by and by, he struck a battalion
marching to storm a block house. He
got down, hitched his horse a few yards
from the road and Joined it. He was
wondering how it would feel to be un
der fire, when just as they were cross
ing another road, with a whir and
whistle and buzz, a cloud of swift in
sects buzzed over his head. Uncon
sciously imitating the soldiers near him
he bent low and walked rapidly. Right
and left of him sounded two or three
low. horrible crunching noises, and
right and left of him two or three blue
shapes eank limply down on their faces.
A sudden sickness seized him, nauseat
ing; him like a fetid odorâ the crunch-
Inr noise was the sound of a bullet
crashing; Into a living human skull as
the men bent forward. One man, he
remembered afterward, dropped with
the culck grunt of an animalâ he was
killed outright; another gave a gasp-
Ing" cry. "Oh, God" â there was a mo
ment of suffering consciousness for
him; a third hopped aside into the
boshesâ cursing angrily. Still another,
as be passed, looked up from the earth
at him with a curious smile, as though
he were half ashamed Â¦ of something;.
"I've rot It, partner," he said, "I
reckon I've rot it, sure." And Grafton
saw a drop of blood and the tiny
month of a wound In his gullet, where
the Sass of his collar fell apart. He
couldn't realize how he feltâ he was not
Interested any longer in how he felt.
The Instinct of life was at work, and
the Instinct of self-defense. When
the others dropped, he dropped gladly;
when they rose, he rose automatically.
A piece of brush, a bush, the low
branch of a tree, a weed seemed to him
protection, and he saw others possessed
with the same absurd idea. Once the
unworthy thought crossed his mind,
when he was lying behind a squad of
'soldiers and a little lower than they,
that his chance was at least better
than theirs. And once, and only once â
â¢with a bitter sting cf shame â he caught
himself dropping back a little, so that
the same squad shpuld be between him
and the enemy; and forthwith he
stepped out into the road, abreast with
the foremost, cursing himself for a
coward, and thereafter took a savage
delight in reckless exposure whenever
it was possible. And he soon saw that
hi3 position was a queer one, and an
unenviable one, as far as a cooi test of
nerve was the point at issue. The offi
cers, he saw, had their men to look
afterâ orders to obeyâ their minds were
occupied. The soldiers were busy get
ting a shot at the enemyâ their minds,
too, were occupied. It was his peculiar
province to stand up and be shot at
without the satisfaction of shooting
back â studying his sensations, mean
while, which were not particularly
pleasant, and studying the rrewsome
horrors about him. And it struck him,
too, that his was a ghastly business,
and an unjustifiable, and that If It
pleased God to see him through he
would never ro to another war except
as a soldier. One consideration Inter
ested him and was satisfactory. No
body was shooting at himâ nobody, was
shooting at anybody in particular. If
he were killed, or when anybody was
killed. It was merely accident,' and it
was thus pleasant to reflect that ha waa
spring: to their feetâ and dropped with
a groanâ dead. Crittenden straight
ened -him out sadlyâ putting his hat
over his face and drawing his arms to
his 'sides.' Above, he saw v.-ith sudden
nausea, buzzards circling â little cared
they whether the dead were American
or Spaniard, as long as there were eyes
to pluck and lips to tear away, and then
straightway, tragedy, merged into com
edy as swiftly as on a stage. Out of
the Â¦ woods across the way emerged a
detail -of negro troopers â sent to clear
the .woods behind of sharpshootersâ
saw a lieutenantâ It was Sharpe. whom
he had met at home and at Chickamau
ga â look back at the soldier, who -was
trying to raise himself on his elbow
while the bullets seemed literally to bÂ«
mo-wijig down the tall grass about him.
Then Crittenden heard a familiar grunt
behind him, and the next minute Bob's
figure sprang out into the open, mak
ing for the- wounded man by the sym
pathy of race. As he stooped, to Crit
tenden's horror. Bqb pitched to thÂ»
ground â threshing around like an ani
mal that has received a blow on the
head. "Without a thought", without con
sciousness of his own motive or hl3 act.
Crittenden sprang to his feet and
dashed for Bob. Within ten feet of the>
boy, his toe caught irs a root and ha
fell headlong. As he scrambled to hla
feet, he saw Sharpe making for himâ
thinking that he had been shot down â
and. as he turned, with Bob in his arms,
half a dozen men, including Grafton
and his own lientensnt, were retreating
in as much danger as anybody.
The firing was pretty hot now, and
the wounded were too many to be han
dled. A hospital man. called out sharp
ly: "Give a hand here." Grafton â¢ :e a
hand to help a poor fellow back to the
field hospital, in a . little hollow, and
when he reached the road again that
black horse and his bc-y rider were
coming back like shadows, through a
rain of bullets, along the edge of the
woods. Once the horsa plunged side
wise and shook his head angrilyâ a
Mauser had stung him in the neckâ but
the lad, pale and his eyes like stars,
lifted him in a flying leap over a
barbed-wire fence and swung him into
the road acain.
"Damn!" said Grafton. simply.
Then arose a loud cheer from the bat
tery on the hill, and, looking west, he
saw the war balloon hung high above
the trees and movies toward Santiago,
flight than a peal of thunder from sky
to earth, and hardly less swift than the
lightning flash that caused it.
"T-t-scu-u-u-h! T-t-seu-oo! T-t-seu
oo!" They went like cloud after cloud
of lightning-winged Insects, and pass
ing, by God's mercy and the Spaniards'
bad marksmanship â passing high. Be
tween two splashes came a sudden
sputter, and some singing thing began
to play up and down through the trees,
and to right and left, In a steady hum.
It was a machine gun playing for the
range â like a mighty hose pipe, water
ing earth and ,. trees with a steady,
spreading jet cf hot lead. It was lik'e

employed In the painter's art.. .
f\i Is In just this regard particularly
that the photographer's skill is best
displayed in making pictures of danc
ing girls. At first thought it might
seem sufficient to let the subject dance
before the camera and simply snapshot
her during her evolutions, while as a
matter of fact not one dancer In fifty
ever reproduces In the studio the per
formance she gives on the stage.
Strange as it may appear, dancing girls
invariably become awkward as soon as
they step before the camera. I cannot
account for It, but it is so.
It Is necespary, therefore, for the
photographer to learn the dancer's best
poses as she executes them In the
dance, after which he can select the
particular series of movements that
will look best in the finished picture.
Of course animation 'la the first requi
site of a pleasing picture. And equally,
of course, each picture must be full of
action. And as each dance is distinc
tive, so each picture should be expres
sive of the whole dance itself. .-..-Â¦
To pose a dancing girl, therefore. It is
necessary to avoid all angles and ugly
lines. To better illustrate what I mean,
look upon the full-page picture printed
on Hie: first page of. this edition. It is
one of. the best dancing poses I have
ever made.
,*y\ S the ;beautles of -the human.
f I mind are exhibited in' all"; their
; ( I perfection by the adornment .of
. JL * language, so are the ever vary
ing physical beauties of the human ex
terior, the form and shape of the
"noblest "work of creation." embellished
by the art of photography.
The photographer's art in many ways
bears a close relatien to that real art
which the inspired painter conceives
and represents upon his canvas. jj This
art has many divisions dnd branches,
but photography follows them all
closely. '
Photography depicts nature without
a touch of the pen, pencil or brush to
disturb the exquisite lines of light and
shade, and is, therefore, not an Imag
inary Ideal, but reaches, nevertheless,
deep Into the domain of the painter's
skill and genius.
Some subjects are awkward in any
attitude, but in the hands of a skillful
photographer they can be made to as
sume a graceful pose, and the results
obtained may be- likened to Talley
rand's witticism on the art of conceal
ing rather than revealing.
Though the best effects are obtained
by adhering to the simplicity of nature,
we are obliged to deal with all sorts of
conditional sitters, and so must make
the best of the whims of one and the
deluded vanity of another.
The painter seeks expression, soul

HOW TO POSE A DANCING GIRL
Now and then a bullet would have a
hoarse sound â that meant it had ri
cochetted. At Intervals of three or
four minutes a huge, old-fashioned pro
jectile would labor through the air,
visible all the time, and crash harm
lessly into the woods. The Americans
called It the "long yellow feller," and
sometimes a negro trooper would turn
and with a yell shoot at It as it passed
over. A little way off, a squad of the
Tenth Cavalry was digging a trenchâ
It was fiercer firing now than ever.
The Spaniards were In the second line
of trenches and were making a sortie.
Under the hill sat Grafton and another
correspondent while the storm of bul
lets swgpt over them. . Grafton was
without glasses â a Mauser had fur
rowed the skin on the bridge of his
nose, breaking his spectacle-frame so
that one glass dropped on one side zZ
his nose and the other on the' other.
The other man had several narrow
squeaks, as he called them, and even
as they sat, a bullet cut a leaf over his
head and it dropped between tlie
pages of his note-book. He closed the
book and looked up.
"Thanks," he said. "That's just
what I want â I'll keep that."
"I observe," said Grafton, "that the
way one of these Infernal bullets pounds
depends entirely on where you happen
to be when you hear it. When a sharp
shooter has picked you out and 13 plug
ging at you, they are intelligent and
vindictive. Coming through that bot
tom, they were for all the world like a
lot of nasty little Insects. , And listen
to 'em r.ow." The other man listened.
"Hear them as they pass over and go
out of hearing. That is for all the
world like the last note of a meadow
lark's song when you hear him afar
oft* and at sunset. But I notice that
simile didn't occur to. me until I got
under the lee of this hill." He looked
arqund. "This hill will be famous, I
suppose. Let's go up higher."- They
went up higher, passing a crowd of
skulkers, or men in reserve â Grafton
could not tell which â and as they went
by a sc-!d!er paid:
v "Well, if I didn't have to be here, I
be damned if J wouldn't like to see
anybody get me here. What them fel
lers come fer, I can't see."
The firing was still hot when the two
men cot up to the danger line, anil
there they lay down. A wounded man
lay at Grafton's elbow. Once '.his 1
throat rattled and Grafton turned curi
ously.
"That's the death-rattle," he said to
himself, and he had never heard a
death-rattle before. The poor fellow's
throat rattled again, and again Graf
ton turned.
"I never knew before," he said to
himself, "that a dying man's throat
rattled but once." Then it flashed on
him with horror that he should have
so little feeling, and he knew it at once
as the curious callousness that comes
quickly to toughen the heart for the
sights of war. A man killed in battle
was not an ordinary man at allâ he
stirred no sensation at all â no more
than a dead animal. Already he had
heard officers remarking calmly to one
another, and apparently without feel-
Ing:
"Well, bo and so was killed to-day."
And he looked back to the disembarka
tion when the army was slmply'lii* a
hurry. Two negro troopers ;7. were
drowned trying to get off on the pier.
They were -fished up; a rope was^tied
about the neck of each, and they were
lashed to the pier and left to be beaten
against the wooden pillars by the
waves for four hours before four com
rades came and took them out and
burled them. Such was the dreadful
callousness that sweeps through the
human heart when war begins, and
he was under its influence himself, and
long afterward he with
shame his idle and half-scientific and
useless curiosity about the wounded
man at his elbow. As he turned his
head, the soldier gave a long, deep,
peaceful sigh, as though he had gone to
sleep. With pity now. Grafton turned
to himâ and he had gone to sleep, but
It was his last sleep.
"Look," said the other man. Craf
ton looked upward. Along the
trenches, and under a hot fire, moved
Jerry Carter, with figure bent, hands
clasped behind him â with the manner,
for all the world, of a. deacon In a
country graveyard looking for In
scriptions on tomb stones.
the Spaniards' trench, and he saw
Blackford's face above him. Then he
was dropped heavily on the ground
again and Blackford pitched across his'
body. There was one glimpse of Abe
Long's anxious face above him, an
other vision of Judith, and then quiet,
painless darkness.
Looking toward Caney he could even
see the^ hill from which he had wit
nessed the flight of the first shell that
had been the storm center of the hur
ricane of death that -had "swept all
through the white,- cloudless day. ,"â¢ It
burst* harmlesslyâ that shell â and
meant no more than a signal to fire to
the soldiers closing in on. Caney, the
Cubans lurking around a block house at
a safe artillery distance In the woods,
and to. the impatient- battery before
San Juan. Retrospectively now. jit
meant thÂ« death knell of brave men,
the quick cry and long groaning of the
wounded, the pained breathing of sick
and fever stricken, the quickened heart
beats of the waiting' and . anxious- at
home â the low sobbing of the women
to whom fatal news came. It meant
Cervera's gallant dash, Sampson and
Schley's great victory," the fall, of San
tiago; freedom for Cuba, a quieter
sleep for .the Maine dead, and peace
â¢with Spain. Once more, as he rose, he
looked at the dark woods, the'dead-
haunted, jungles which the moon was
draping with a more than mortal
beauty, and he knew that in them, as 1
in the long grass of the orchard-Uke
valley below him, comrade was looking
for dead comrade. And among the
searchers, was the faithful Bob, look-
Ing for Old Captain. Crittenden, his
honest heart nigh to bursting,, for al
ready he had found Raincrow torn with
a shell and he Had borne a body back to
the horror-haunted little hospital under
the creek bank at the Bloody Fordâ a
body from which the hÂ«ad hung over
his shoulderâ llmo, with a bullet hc*!e

Young Captain, Basil.
Grafton sat, sobered and saddened,
whera he was awhile.' The moon swung
upward, white and peaceful, toward
mild-eyed stars. Crickets chirped In
the graes around him, and nature's low
night mueic started In the woods and
the valley below, as though the earth
had never known the hell of fire and
human passion that "had rocked it
through that day. Was there so much
difference between the creatures pf the
earth and the creatures of his own
proud estate? Had they not both been
on the same brute level that day? And.
save for. the wounded and "the men who
had comrades - wounded and dead, were
not/the unharmed as careless, almost
as indifferent as cricket and tree toad
to the tragedies of their, sphere? Had
there been any inner change in any
guava'bush and mango tree, down
through clumps of Spanish bayonet,
on stiff figures that would rise no
more; on white, set faces with the
peace of. painless death upon them or
the agony of silent torture, fought out
under fierce heat and in the eilence of
the Jungle alone. â¢
â¢ Once Grafton started into a tent.
On the first cot lay a handsome boy,
with a white, frank face, and a bullet
hole through his neck, and he recog
nized the dashlns: little fellow whom
he had seen splashing through the
bloody ford at a gallop, dropping 'from
his horse at a barbed-wire fence, and
dashing on afoot with the Rough Ri
ders. The face bore a strong likeness
to the face he had seen on the hillâ of
the Kentucklan. Crittendenâ the Ken
tucky regular, as Grafton always men
tally characterized him â and he won
dered if the boy were not the brother
of whom he had heard. The lad was
still aliveâ but how could he live with
.that wound in his throat? Graf ton's
eyes filled with tears; It was horror â
horror â all horror.
Here and there along the shadowed
road lay a lifeless mule or horse or a
dead man. It was curious, but a man
killed in battle was not like an ordi
nary dead man â he was no more than
he was â a lump of clay. It was more
curious still that one's pity seemed less
acute for man than for horse; it was
the man's choice to take the riskâ the
horse had no. choice.
Here and there by the roadside was a
grave. Comrades. had halted there long
enough to save a comrade from the
birds of prey.: Every- itow and then he
would meet a pack train' loaded with
ammunition and ration boxes; or a
wagon drawn by six mules and driven
by a swearing, fearless, tireless team
ster. .The forest was ringing with the
noise of wheels, the creaking of har
ness, the shouts of teamsters and the
guards with them and the officer In
charge â all on the way to the working
beavers on top of the conquered hilL
Â¦ Going the other "way were the poor
wounded, on foot, in little groups of
slowly moving twos and threes, and In
jolting, sprlngless army wagons â on
their way of torture to more torture in
the rear. His heart bled for them.
And the way those men took their suf
fering! Sometimes the Jolting wagons
were too much for human endurance,
and soldiers would pray for the driver,
when he stopped, not to start again. In
one ambulance that he overtook, a man
groaned.
"Grit your teeth," said another, an
old" Irish sergeant, sternlyâ "Grit your
teeth; there's others that's hurt worse'n
you." The sergeant lifted his head, and
a bandage showed that he was shot
through the face, and Grafton heard
not another sound. - But It was the
slightly hurtâ the men shot In the leg
or arm â who made the most noise. He
had seen three men brought into the
hospital from San Juan. The. surgeon
took the one who was groaning. - He
had a mere scratch on one leg. An
other was dressed, and while the third
sat silently on a stool, still another was
attended, and another, before the sur-
man who had fought that day that was
not /or the worse? Would he himself
get normal again,- he wondered? Was
there one sensitive soul who fully real
ized the horror of that day? If so, he
would better have been at home. The
one fact that stood above every
thought that had come to him that day
was the utter, the startling insignifi
cance of death. Could that mean much
more than a startllngly sudden lower
ing of the estimate put upon' human
life? Across . the hollow behind him
and from a tall palm over the Spanish
trenches, rose, loud and clear, the night
song of a mocking-bird. Over there
the little men in blue were tolling:, toll
ing, tolling at their trenches: and
along the crest of the hill th-; big men
in blue were toiling, tolling, toiling at
theirs. All through the night anxious
eyes would be strained for Chaffee.
and at dawn the slaughter would begin
again. Wherever he looked, he could
see with his mind's eye stark faces In
the long grass of the valley and the
Spanish bayonet clumps in the woods.
All day he had seen them there â dying
of thirst, bleeding to deathâ alone. As
he went down the hill, lights were mov
ing along the creek bed. A row of
muffled dead lay along the bed of the
creek. Yet they were still bringing in
dead and wounded â a dead officer with
his will and a letter to his wife clasped
in his hand. He had lived long enough
to write them. Hollow-eyed surgeons
were moving here and there. Up the
bank of the creek, a voice rose:
"Come on, ' boys'* â appeallngly â
"you're not going back on me. Come
on, you cursed cowards! Good! I take
It back, boys. Now we've got 'em!"
Another voice: 1 "Kill me,, somebody
kill me. For God's sake, kill me.
Won't somebody give me a pistol? God
âGodâ"
Dusk fell quickly. The: full moon
rose. The stars came out, and under
them, at the foot of the big mountains,
a red fire burned sharply out In the
mist rising over captured Caney, from
which- tireless was . already
starting- his worn-out soldiers on. an
all-night march by the. rear and to the
trenches at San Juan. And along the
stormed hill side camp fires were glow.-'
lnc out where the lucky soldiers who
had rations to cook were cheerily fry
ing, bacon .. and hardtack. Â¦ Grafton
moved down to* watch one squad and,
as he stood on the edge of the* firelight,
wondering at the cheery, talk and Jok
ing laughter, somebody behind him said
sharply: ' .,.'Â¦.. t
"Watch out, there." and he turned to
find' himself on the edge of a? grave
which a detail- was ' digging riot ten
yards away from the fireâ digging for
a dead comrade. . Never had he .seen, a
more peaceful moonlit night than the
night that closed over the battle field.
Â«It was hard for him to realize that the
day had not been a terrible dream, and
yet, as the moon rose,* its. rich'. light,- he
knew, was stealing into the guerrilla
haunted jungles, stealing ' through

trench, with Sharpe lylng # with his face

and the dead Spaniards, Americans. and
Cubans about them, Grafton told the
story of Crittenden. And at- the end
tbe other man gave a low. whistle' and
smote the back .of one hand Into the
palm of the other softly. '. "â¢Â¦'-'Â¦<Â¦
"Up there." And two hospital men,
with a Jitter, came toward them and
took up the body. As thsy passed,
Grafton- recoiled.
"Good God!" It was Crittenden. : v
cloee tp the to"p of : the.' hill.' ; Ntw and
then one would" duckâ particularly the
one on the end. He had hla. tongue In.
the corner of his mouth, was twirling
his Dick over his shoulder like a rail
road hand, and grunting with, every
stroke. Grafton sould hear, him.
"Fqh Gawd (huh!) never thought
(huh!) I'd git to love (huh!) a pick be
foh!" Grafton broke into laugh. J
"You see the change?" Â¦ ,"Â¦; .
"Part of it." V ' Â«
"That tall fellow with the blue hand
kerchief afound his throat, bare-head
ed, long hair?" Â¦ Â¦-jl'V
"Wellâ " the other man stopped for
a moment. His .eye had Â» caught sight
of a figure on the groundâ <m top of the
trench, and with the profile' of his face
between him and the after-glow, <and
his tone changedâ "there he is!"
Grafton pressed closer.- "What, that
the fellow?"^ There was the handker
chief, the he"ad was bare, the hair long
and dark. The man's eyes were closed,
but he was breathing. Beknvr^hem at
that moment they heard the' surgeon
say: i ' ' . - Â¦; . .' ,; >
He could not stand that hoarse, rasp
ing whisper much longer. His canteen
he had clung toâ the regular had
taught him thatâ and he tried again
to move. A thousand needles shot
through himâ every one, it seemed,
passing through a nerve-center and
back the same path again. He heard
his own teeth crunch aa he had often
heard the teeth of a drunken man
man crunch, and then he became un
conscious. When he came to, the man
was still muttering; but this time it
was a woman's name, and Crittenden
lay still. Good God!
"Judithâ Judithâ Judith!" each time
more faintly stllL There were other
Judiths in the world, but the voice â he
knew.- the voice â somewhere he had
heard it. The moon was coming; It
had crossed the other man's feet and
was creeping up his twisted body. It
would reach his face in time, and. if
he could keep from fainting again, he
would see.
""Water! water! water!"
,Why did not some one answer? Crit
tenden called and called and called; but
he could little more than whisper.
Crittenden could not move. He could
see the lights in the tents; the half
naked figures stretched on tables; and
doctors with-bloody arms about them â
cutting and bandagingâ one with his
hands inside a man's stomach, working
and kneading the bowels as though
they were dough. Now and then four
negro troopers would appear with
something In a blanket, would walk
around the tent where there was a long
trench, and, standing at the head of
this, two would lift up their ends of
the blanket and the other two would
let go, and a shapeless shape would
drop into the trench. Up and down
near by strolled two young lieutenants,
smoking cigarettesâ calmly, carelessly.
He could see all this, but that was all
right; that was, all right! Everything
was all right except that long, black
shape in the shadow near him gasp
"Water! water! water!"
Grafton passed on â sick. On along
the muddy road â through more pack
trains, wagons, shouts, creakings, curs
ings. On through the beautiful moon
light night and through the beautiful
tropical forest, under tall cocoanut and
taller palm; on past the one long grave
of the Rough Ridersâ along the battle
line of the first little fightâ through the
ghastly, many-colored masses of hide
ous land crabs shuffling sidewise Into
the cactus and shuffling on with an un
earthly rustling- of dead twig and fallen
leaf; along the crest of the foothills
and down to the little town of Slboney,
lighted, bustling with preparation for
the wounded in the tents; bustling at
the beach with the unloading of ra
tions, the transports moving here and
there far out on the moon-lighted sea.
Down there were straggler, wounded
soldier, teamster, mule packer, refugee
Cuban, correspondent, nurse, doctor,
surgeon â the flotsam and jetsam of the
battle of the day.
The moon rose. â¢ Â«
"Water! water! water!"
"Yes, sir."
That day he had seen a soldier stag
ger out from the firing line with half
his face shot away and go staggering
to the rear without aid. On the way he
met. a mounted staff officer, and he
raised his hand to his hatless, bleeding
forehead. In a stern salute and. with
out a gesture for aid. staggered on.
The officer's eyes filled with tears.
"Lieutenant," said a trcopcr. Just
after the charge on the trenches, "I
think I'm wounded."
"Can you get to ti. rear without
help?"
"I think I can. sir." and he started.
Af.ter twenty paces he pitched forward
âdead. His wound was through the
heart.
At the divisional hospital were more
lights, tents, surgeons, stripped figures
on the tables under the lights; rows of
figures In darkness outside the tents;
and rows of muffled shapes behind; the
smell of . anesthetics and cleansing
fluids; heavy breathing, heavy groan
ing, and an occasional curse on the
night air.
Beyond him was a stretch of moon
lit road and coming toward him was a
soldier, his arm in a sling, and stagger
ing wea'kly from side to side. With a
start of pure gladness he saw it was
Crittenden. and he advanced with his
hand outstretched.
"Are you badly hurt?"
"Oh, no." said Crittenden, pointing
to his hand and arm, but not mention
ing the bullet through his chest.
"Oh, but I'm glad. I thought you
were gone sure when I saw you laid
out on the hill."
"Oh, I am all right," he said, and his
manner was as courteous as though he
had been in a drawing-room; but, in
spite of hla f nonchalance, Grafton saw
him stagger when he moved off.
"I say. you oughtn't to be walking."
he called. "Let me help you." but
Crittenden waved him off.
"Oh, I'm all right." he repeated, and
then he stopped. "Do you know where
the hospital is?"
"God!" said Grafton softly, and he
ran back and put his arm around* the
soldier â Crittenden laughing weakly:
"I missed it somehow."
"Yes, It's back "here," said Grafton
gently, and he saw naw that the sol
dier's eyes were dazed and that he
breathed heavily and leaned on him,
laughing and apologizing, now and
then with a curious shame at his weak
ness. As they turned from the road at
the hospital entrance, Crittenden
dropped to the ground.
"Thank you, but I'm afraid I'll have
to rest a little while now. I'm all right
nowâ don't bother â don't bother. I'm
all right. I feel kind o* sleepy â some
how â very kind â thank â " and he
closed his eyes. A surgeon was pass
ing and Grafton called him.
"He's all right." said the surgeon,
with a swift look, adding shortly, "but
he must take his turn."
geon turned to the man who was so
patiently awaiting his turn.
"Where are you hurt?"
The man pointed to his left side.
"Through?"
Over at the block house, Crittenden
stopped flrlhg suddenly, and turning to
his men shouted.
"Get back over the hill, boys; they're
going to start in again." As they ran
back, a lieutenant colonel met them.
"Are you in command?"
Crittenden saluted.
"No, sir." he said.
"Yes, sir," said the old sergeant at
his Bide. "He was. He brought these
men up the hill."
"The hell he did. Where are your
officers?"
The old sergeant motioned to the val
ley below, and Crittenden opened his
lips to explain, but Just then the sud
den imoressJon came to him that some
one had struck him from behind with
the butt of a musket, and he tried to
wheel aroundâ his face amazed and
wondering. Then he dropped. He won
dered, too, why he couldn't get around,
and then he wondered how It was that
he happened to be falling to the earth.
Darkness came then, and through it
ran one bitter thoughtâ he had been
shot in the back. He did think of his
mother and Judithâ but It was a fleet
ing vision of both, and his main
thought was a dull wonder whether
there would be anybody to explain how
It was that his wound was not In the
front. And then, as he felt himself
lifted, it Hashed that he would at least
be found on top of the hill, and beyond
Crittenden was the first to spring to his
feet, and Abe Long and Reynolds
sprang after htm. Forward they slip
ped on their bellies, and the men be
hind saw one brown, knotty hand after
another reach up from the grass and
clip. clip, clip through the thickly
braided wires.
Forward again! The men slipped like
eels through and under the wires, and
lay in the long grass behind. The time
was come. *
â¢FORWARD!"
Orittenden never knew before the
thrill that blast sent through him. and
never in his life did he know it again.
It was the call of America to the
American, white and black: and race
and color forgotten, the American an
swered with the grit of the Saxon, the
Celt's pure love of a fight, and all the
dush of the passionate Gaul.
As Crittenden Iraped tÂ«.- his fe^t. h<?
saw Reynolds leap tco. and then there
was a hissing: hell of white smoke and
crackling iron at his feetâ and Rey
nolds disappeared. â¢
It was a marvc'. afterward but. at
that moment. Crittenden hardly noted
that the poor fellow was blown into a
hundred fragments. He was in the
front line now. A bripadier. with his
hat in his hand and his white hair
shining in the sun, ran diagonally
across in front of his line of battle,
and, with a wild cheer, the run of
d-'ath began.
God. how the bullets hissed and the
shells shrieked; and, God. how slowâ
slowâ slowâ was the run! Crittenden's
legs were of lead, and leaden were the
l^gs of the men with himâ running
with guna trailing the earth or caught
tightly across the breast and creeping
unconsciously. He saw nothing but
the men in front of him, the men who
were dropping behind him. and the yel
low line above, and the haven at the
bottom of the hill. Now and then he
could see a little, dirty, blue figure leap
into view on the hill and disappear.
Two men only were ahead of him when
he reached the foot of the hillâ Sharpe
and a tall Cuban close at his side with
machete drawnâ the one Cuban hero of
that fierce charge. But he could hear
labored panting behind him. and he
knew that others were coming on. God,
how steep and high that hill was! He
was gasping; for breath now, and he
was side by side with Cuban and lieu
tenantâgasping, too. To right and left
âfaint cheers. To the right, a machine
gun playing like hall on the yeiiow dirt.
To his left a shell, bursting in front
of a climbing, struggling group, and the
soldiers tumbling backward and rolling
ten feet down the hill. A lull in the fir
ingâthe Spaniards were runningâ and
then the top â the top! Sharpe sprang
over the trench, calling out to save the
wounded. A crouching Spaniard raised
his pistol, and Sharpe fell. With one
leap, Crittenden reached him with the
butt of his gun and, with savage exul
tation, he heard the skull cv the Span
iard crash.
Straight in front, the Spaniards were
running like rabbits through the brush.
To the left, Kent was charging far
around and out of sight. To the right.
Rough Riders and negroes were driv
ing Spaniards down one hill and up the
next. The negroes were as wild as at a
camp meeting or a voodoo dance. One
big sergeant strode along brandishing
in each hand a piece of his carbine that
had been shot in two by a Mauser bul
let, and shouting at the top of his voice,
contemptuously:
"Heah, somebody, gimme a gun!
Gimme a gun, I tell ye," still striding
ahead and looking never behind him.
"You don't know how to fight. Gimme
a gun!" To the negro's left, a young
lieutenant was going up the hill with
naked sword In one hand and a kodak
in the otherâ taking pictures as he ran.
A bare-headed boy. running between
him and a gigantic negro trooper, top
pled suddenly and fell, and another ne
gro stopped In the charge, and, with a
groan, bent over him and went no
farther.
And all the time that machine gun
was playing on the trenches like a hard
rain In summer dust. Whenever a Span
iard would leap from the trenches, he
fell headlong. That pitiless fire kept in
the trenches the Spaniards who were
found there â wretched, pathetic, half
starved little creaturesâ and some ter
rible deeds were done in the lust of
daughter. One gaunt fellow thrust a
clasp knife into the buttock of a sham
ming Spaniard, and, when he sprang to
his feet, blew the back of his head off.
Some of the riders chased the enemy
over the hill and lay down in the shade.
One of them pulled out a dead Span
iard's pocket cigarettes, cigars and a
lady's slipper of white satin; with a
grunt he put the slipper back. Below
the trenches, two boyish prisoners sat
under a tree, crying as though they
were broken-hearted, and a big trooper
walked up and patted them both kindly
on the head.
"Don't cry. boys; It's all rightâ all
right." he said, helplessly.

searched we both must be," arid he
touched a bell. A stout-limbed mes
senger at once appeared, j and Mr. C.
bade him lock the door. When this
was done Mr. C. said:
"Morton, a valuable coin has myste
riously disappeared. To clear us from
all conceivable suspicion, I want you
to search me thoroughly, and then' you
will search this gentleman." -
"No. never," burst out. from the an
guished Dean. "I defy you to touch me.
I warn you that I shall defend myself."
But Morton was by this time busy
turning Mr. C.'s pockets inside .out,
and after an exhaustive but ~ fruitless
examination, he approached the Dean,
while Mr. C. began to replace the books
upon the table, evidently shrinking
from what could not fail to be a painful
and distressing scene. The Dean, now
white to the lips,* and with every nerve
strained to cracking, was standing with
his back to the wall," and with a voice
hoarse with emotion, he was Just be
ginning, "I tell youâ," when : 'Mr. C.
uttered a loud exclamation of ", Joyful
surprise. The lost coin ;â¢ had dropped
out of a book which had nearly slipped
out of his hand as he was putting it on
the table, and _ it < was rolling across the
floor to Morton's feet;; The book, which
was a large one, must have closed upon
it, as stiff-bound books will ; sometimes
doi and the coin Had lain hidden
among its; pages all the time. Morton
stooped, and picked Jt up. and gave.it

: "Yes, yes. thank you, Morton. I. am

He unlocked the, door and went out;
and' when he had -closed It again, -the
Dean, murmuring, "My God, my God, I
thank' thee," sank into a chair ex
hausted. 1 Mr. C. looked at' him in
silence, and stretched out. his hand
which the Dean grasped 'warmly. Then
he said:
"Forgive me, Mr. Dean, but what else
could I do?'. I am'as heartily relieved
as you can possibly be. But now that
the strain is over, may I venture to say
that." your conduct . has entirely per

Another objection which may be
urged Is that if the parents give regu
larly they lose the great pleasure which
comes "from the child's grateful appre
ciation of what he receives unexpected
ly. However, this objection may bÂ«
met quite easily also. At uncertain
times the parent may very properly
give additional money for exceptional
acts worthy of praise, or for work done
or for no reason whatever except the
desire to show a loving consideration of
the wishes of the child. There are
many times when every child will be
very anxious to have certain things.
which could not be purchased by what
could be saved from the regular allow,
ance. If the parent approve the pur
chase, there Is every reason for giving
a child additional at such times.
Even if these objections could not so
easily be met, most parents would
agree that the benefits to be derived
from a regular allowance are greater
than the selfish gratification of the pa
rent, who wishes to give to please him
self. Surely the welfare of the child U
of greater importance than the present
gratification of the parent.
In the hope of helping those consider
ing the matter, the writer gives the de
tails of a plan used with his own chil
dren.
Each child was provided with a pock
etbook or small bank, for the care of
which each was made entirely respon
sible, that he might' learn to guard
against the results of carelessness.
On Monday evenings a certain
amount of money was given to each
child. The effort was made to pay
promptly and systematically. Only In
this way would the children learn to be
regular and systematic.
Each one was required to save at
least one-half of his weekly allowance.
In this way It was hoped that the chil
dren might be taught habits of econo
my and of providing for the future. :
The other one-half was entirely at the
disposal of each child. This was dona
that he might learn to exercise , Judg
ment In the expenditure of money.
CT^HE P |an which most parents fol-
I low In the giving of money to
I : children is to have no system at
" JL all. While it will generally be
, acknowledged that this is not
best, yet most plans of which parents
know are so cumbersome that it seems
impossible for busy parents to' find
time to carry into practical use any
plans so complicated and requiring so
much time and thought.
Some, parents feel that no child
should be given any money at any
time. This will certainly be the easiest
way for parents; for if children know
they will never be given any money
they will not bother their parents for
It.. They will probably worry them,
however,* by their . demands for other
rewards just as often. It is just possi
ble that these rewards will be harder to
grant and less valuable than money as
an educational factor.
Against the custom of having no
method* may be .urged certain objec
tions which every, parent should
thoughtfully:- consider. It tends to
train a child to obtain desired money
by teasing 'if not. by dishonesty. It is
apt to blunt his feelings of delicacy
arid give him* the. feeling, of servility.
The. money being. received at uncertain
times is sure to be spent without
careful consideration of Its use or
value. -i Under such a plan the boy has
no reason for taking care of his money,
as he? is likely to have more at any
time. Â¦ As , he Â¦Â¦ receives it unexpectedly
he has no time to make any plans or to
arrive at any conclusions after deliber
ate , judgment. There Is no reason to
practice, self-denial, aa he may : have
niore to spend to-morrow. If he espe
cially.; desires more he ; knows he will
have a good chance to secure It by per
sistent teasing, If not by some ', worse
method. > '.'â¢ Â¦...- ~
Some -parents, wisely '.Insist that the
better way Is to make a regular allow
ance to each child, no matter how large
or'how small 'the allowance may be.
Almost every parent does : give some
money to each child. This plan simply
requires that it be given regularly and
in a business-like way. Surely such a
plan has some advantages worth con
sidering.
By giving a regular allowance the
child may be taught the right use of
money, than which few things are more
important for the child's future happi
ness. Much of the misery In this life
is the result, not so much of the lack of
money as of its improper and improvi
dent use. How many never learn to
live within their income! Kow few
early realize the Importance of laying
aside something for the Inevitable rainy
day! Is not the whole pathway of life
thickly strewn with wrecks caused by
not having learned the necessity of
spending less than the Income?
The child who knows he will have a
certain allowance will eoon develop
such practical wisdom, forethought,
economy and business Judgment as will
greatly surprise his parents^ He will be
strongly Influenced to be careful of his
money, as he will learn that it will not
be replaced until a certain time.
Teach children the right use of money
and you will have done much to make
the men and the women of the future
less liable to become loafers, paupers
and criminals. You will have done
much to teach them economy, not only
of money, but of time and of energy as
well. You will have taught them to be
thrifty and orderly in all business and
prepared for adversity. If these things
are true, Is not the subject worthy of
most careful consideration by every
parent?
The principal objection to the giving
of a regular allowance la found in the
fact that children are likely to feel that
they are given only that which is due
them. While there Is some truth in this
argument, yet It may easily be met by
having it understood that the allowance
is dependent on such conduct as the
parents have a right to expect. It may
thus be used as a strong Incentive to
proper conduct
DEAN is an undeniably respec
/ I table personage. N'o special
I I consecration fences him off
JL from the lower herd, and he is
not hampered in his utterances
â¢r recreations by the formidable
grandeur of a seat in the upper house;
but what with shovel hat and apron
and gaiters he might easily pass for a
Bishop, or even an Archbishop. In
deed much has yet to be written on
the ethics of dress, but that would be
an unpardonable digression here. He
is not Most, and- not quite Right, but
he is Very Reverend, and that is some
thing to live up to.
Dean B. was* a single-minded, earnest
Christian man of blameless life and
character, and widely known for his
unclouded faith and personal holiness.
He was an ardent numismatist, and
in the course of his travels in the East
he had been fortunate enough to hit
upon .a number of rare coins, his collec
tion being one of exceptional interest
He called one day at the British Mu
seum, and going to the numismatic de
partment he begged to be shown a cer
tain coin which was catalogued unique.
The keeper, Mr. C, who knew the Dean,
was courtesy itself to him, and asked
him to be seated, while he unlocked the
case and produced the coin. The Dean
took it in his hand and examined it mi
nutely with a magnifying lass, seeking
for marks which it apparently gave
him great satisfaction to find. Mr. C.
in the meanwhile turned to his papers
in order to leave the Dean undisturbed,
till, the scrutiny of the coin having been
completed, they began to converse on
different matters,, and presently the
Dean arose, and, thanking Mr. C. for
his kindness, prepared to take his leave.
"Good-by, Mr. Dean, we .ire always
glad to see you here. But," Mr. C
added, holding out his hand with a
smile, "the coin, If you please, before
you go."
"The coin? Why, I put.it on the
table some time ago, before we began
to talk."
"It must be there then," and they pro-
ceeded to look for it. The table was lit
tered with books of reference, ? which
they had been consulting some of them
open, and some shut. They turned these
over again and again, they moved them
one by one, they hunted everywhere,
but the coin had vanishea.
"What a remarkable thing!" ex
claimed the Dean. "What can have be
come of that coin? It certainlv must
be somewhere on this table," and .they
resumed their labors with Ill-repressed
anxiety added to their energy; but it
was all to no purpose; every book and
every paper was put carefully aside,
but the coin was not to be found. Mr.
C. was now looking very grave, as he
turned to his euest.
"Mr. Dean, I need hardly tell you
that this has become most serious for
us both, and it cannot rest here. I am
responsible to the nation for the safe
custody of this coin, and â "
"But," urged the unhappy Dean In
plaintive despair, "I solemnly declare to
you that I placed it on the table. I
placed it there with my own hand. I
distinctly remember having done so.
You surely cannot doubt my word?"
"No, Mr. Dean, it Is not for me to
accept or dispute your statement- My
business is to restore the coin to its
place, and where is it now?"
"God in Heaven only knows, for I
don't." and the words were not used
as they sometimes are in anger or im
patience, but with all the pathetic
pleading of a heart- wrung prayer.
Mr. C. glanced once more at the table,
the books, and the papers, he scanned
the floor, he lifted up the fender, he
looked In every possible and impossible
place, and then he faced the poor Dean.
"There is nothing else for it .The
coin is missing. Only you and I have
handled it, and no else has been pres
ent. I am deeply grieved, Mr. Dean,
but we must both be searched."
To his surprise, the Dean, who was
very pale and agitated, drew himself
up to his Cull height and protested that
no consideration would induce him to
submit to such an indignity.
"You know perfectly well, he maln-

THE DEAN amid THE COIN
The true idealist echoes Sir Wa' .
Scott's description of love:
It is the secret sympathy.
The sliver link, the silken tie.
Â¦\Yhleh heart to heart and mind to mind
In body and in soul can bind.
A mother who from fear of losing her
daughter never speaks to her of love
is far more likely to see her waste her
ful mirage effects off the north coast of
Ireland I called a. girl's attention to the
wondrous hills, lakes, and even castle
towers pictured in the sky. "Oh, I can't
see any of these things," was the curt
reply, "there must be something wrong
with your eyes to picture them." How
ever, it, might have been maintained
IN this encyclopedic ape we con
gratulate ourselves in having with
in reach Information en every con
ceivable subject. Hardly is such a
word as mirage broached than its defin
ition is found to be: "an intermediate
stratum between a cold jrround stratum
and a warm upper stratum, giving rise
to more than one image inverted or
erect or both according to positions."
Dull as such a description may sound
at first sight, it is deeply interesting
when regarded as illustrative of the
ideal of marriage.
Is not the ideal of marriage inverted
or erect, according to the position of
the person viewing it? Topsy-turvy
is indeed the presentment seen by most
people of this possible era of their life.
Surely this picture of far-reaching
fresh interest Is worth seeing from a
proper point of view. Money, position,
family, rank, mostly seem to ba the
standpoints for viewing such a serious
matter. Is it then a wonder that the
Image Is inverted? and that the cold
atmosphere of the v.orld fails to reflect
the visions of ardent imagination?
Although, as a clergyman rightly re
marked to me one day. a wedding is one
of the most interesting things there is,
and in a village no one seems too old
or too busy to go if possible and see the
ceremony, marriage from an abstract
point of view has not yet been put in
Its proper position.
Such superior men as Shakespeare,
Sir Walter Scott, Horace, Beethoven.
Swedenborg and Tennyson have all
tried to give the world prints from the
photographs made in the light of their
own ideal, but the world is ept to look
upon these truths as the rhapsodies of
romantic minds not fitting for ordinary
life â It is well that they cannot be said
to be the mere sentiments of women.
No, the true ideal of marriage has not
been based upon any evanescent femi
nine fancy, but it has been founded
on the great doctrine of reciprocity
taught by Confucius. Without reciproc
ity where is morality? Well may
Shakespeare say: "From loveless mar
riage base adultery springs," for where,
as the Chinese philosopher taught, is
the logic of a relation in which the two
factors are wanting in an essential
quality?
Society mothers often regard the
prospect of a daughter's marriage
merely as a means for her obtaining
exhaustive chiffons and an establish
ment of her own. Is it astonishing that
puch an inverted ideal of happiness
fades as the pleasure of mere luxury
palls? Where is the reciprocity in such
a relation?
Many mothers incline to the belief
that their girls never ponder on what
might be the bliss of having a home in
the heart of another. To hear such
peopie speak one would suppose that
the era of romance and poetry had
closed at their own marriage, and the
feeling of love, or as Amiel, the charm
ing French writer, expressed it, the
feeling of the want to love (le besoin
d'aimer) became extinct in the race at
their own wedding. "Does Elsie ever
epeak to you of marriage?" I asked a
mother, thinking her lS-year-old
daughter might have talked to her of
the idea. "Oh. dear no, of course not,"
Â¦was the decided reply. "She has no
sentiment, she is quite contented with
her hockey and her golf." And yet that
same girl came into the room a few
days later sparkling and blushing be
cause a friend had assumed that her
brother's photograph found in her vio
lin case was that af an "admirer."
Far be it from me to think that girls'
their Invitations to dinners and so
called "At Homes," but where all
homelike surroundings are conspicuous
by their absence, where Is the friendli
ness that makes a young man feel wel
come at the hearth during the Ions
evenings when cheerless rooms or for
mal clubs are the only alternatives to
music-halls and other places of amuse
ment? Nature shut out of the door
comes in at the window, and debarred
from the society of their equals, do not
men often consort with girls of another
platform of thought, feeling and edu
cation, who become the mothers of the
grandchildren of those who ignored
any possible ideal of their sbns?
In the Earl of Russell's cause celebre
one note of pathos was sounded: when
the young nobleman was asked why he
had taken such an unsuitable wife, he
said that had he been Imbued with any
idea of the seriousness of marriage he
never would have entered Into It In the
thoughtless way he h: !.
Albeit the most important of all steps,
how often Is the idea of marriage treat
ed merely as a mirage to fade like a re
flection In the sky, instead of being the
forecast of a true happiness, the ful
fillment of the ideal!
It has been said the reason why so
few marriages are happy Is "because
women spend their time in making net*
not cages." Would that women would
give half the time and care to the cul
tivation of their intellects they do
to the adornment of their persons!
Then one would not hear earnest men
say: "Life is too serious for me to
think of marriage. How could my
ideals of life be carried out with a
frivolous woman?" What condemna
tion for the vapidity of women lurks
in such words!
"A congenial complementary spirit
strong where I am weak, and weak
where I am strong, was once my Ideal."
says another man, "but, alas! that Ideal
has faded like the sunset in the sum
mer sky."
Cynicism leads us, we know, to de
spair, and a marriage of commonplace
love (alltagsliebe) is often the fate of
one who ceases to bell-ve In the ideal
miraged in his imagination. But as
the laws of life must be fulfilled they
often learn too late the truth Involved
in the ideal.
"True love, the gift which God has
given to man alone beneath the
heaven," wrote Sir Walter Scott, and
as he also taught the eternal quality
of this great gift we can hope that
there is still eternity In which to realize
it. When one sees the Joy of house
holds where the real union of souls ia
accomplished, one wishes that girls
would fit themselves more for such a
happy lot, instead of frittering all their
days in hockey, golf and other games.
Exercise for the body is of course
necessary, but not at the expense oC
the brains which stultr in Idleness.
When the mirage of a happy marriage
appears on the horizon of the heart,
cannot a girl be intelligently told that
It is an Ideal placed by the Creator in
the mind of man to cheer him In life's
dreary desert with the thought of ihe
refreshment awaiting him in the oasis
of companionship if he be "but qualified
to find it?
But as a limb withers if never used,
the mind loses its alertness when n.*t
exercised, and If men stamp out all *.he
poetry of their nature, and women
Ignore all the powers of their intellects,
they fail to focus the object of their
past Ideal of being, even when It may
be In sight.
"Life," as Tolstoy says, "has no Joy
to a rational being if he do not know
Its meaning," and "true happiness In
volves the sense of the ideal"â seen In
the mirage of marriage.

Implied the girl with an ideal too high
tobe satisfied by the first aspirant.
* "Do you 'think: there is such a thing
as true-love?" said a young girl to me
one day. "Mamma says there Is not,
so If ever I come across a handsome
rich man who likes me, I shall be quite
contented to marry him."
Truly -the finder In the "camera" of
that girl's heart was out of gear. How
could she focus any true view of life
In such a spirit? As Pin'dar wrote: "It
is duty to harbor goodly hope"; and as
an Elizabethan poet said: "Love is the
only line which leadeth men to the
fount of wisdom.". /
Is it not moreover as depressing to

of the soul, as it is chilling to have no

eye?:^'{. â¢ ;/ ; : â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦

magorlcal It was probably only the re
flection of a real landscape in the far

be so rare. 1
Napoleon we are told, spent many
months in the study of novels, as he
hoped to arrive at some stratum of
judgment on marriage, which his great
organizing spirit saw was such an im
portant factor for good or evil in the
campaign of life.
How short-sighted are parents who
Ignore this importance!
"My son will never marry," one hears
a selfish mother say, "for he has me
to take care of." So fearing to face the
reproaches of his parent the son mar
ries secretly one totallyâ unfitted to be
the companion of his life and the
mother of his children, when a little
timely help and sympathy in such an
Important step might have ensured a
congenial marriage. "Would not a par
. ent's care and thought often prevent a
young man taking "trash for treasure,"
to the discord instead of the harmony
of life?
We all know that when met by the
unjust conditions of Rome, Caesar
boldly crossed the Rubicon which lay
between his forces and Italy proper,
and at the head of his faithful ple
beians he then waged long and severe
warfare against the patricians. May it
not be as well to recollect that when a
proper course is not given to the con
sideration of the important matter of
marriage, the Rubicon of convention
ality Is often recklessly crossed and a
"long warfare ensues between the par
ents set at defiance, and the son who
feels that he has been robbed of a
proper position in the : :nate of his
own life?
It is one of the saddest of life's ironies
that marriage, planned by the Creator
(whose most beautiful name is Love) to
be the joy-giving union of two comple
mentary developed spirits. Is so often a
failure. But would not failure meet
any union contracted in such a hap
hazard way as marriage often is?
What would be thought of a commer
cial partnership formed with little or
no understanding of the qualities and
needs of both parties?
And how can "the true marriage that
gives to each the strength of two be
the result of unions contracted merely
with, a view to concomitant social ad
vantage?" wrote Mrs. Fitz-Gerald.
Those who marry with such poor
ideals doubtless attain their end, but
is the end noble enough to beautify life,
and make it one happy spring-time of
ever-fresh joy and companionship?
"Love is man's grand opportunity,"
said a great writer, and as love is the
joy of human life, so marriage is its
coping-stone. Matchmaking is indeed
the last course to be commended, but if
Love Is man's (and of course man in
cludes woman) grand opportunity,
should not more chance be given by
the heads of families for their children
to have this opportunity? No parent
expects a son to succeed In a profes
sion, however great his talent may bj,
without seeing those occupied In th.'C
profession, and yet a young man la
supposed to take a good position matri
monially with no means of consorting
with really congenial girls who would
prove fitting helpmeets.
"True sympathy starts from a true
Intuition," but are not opportunities re
quired to test this sympathy, or the
Brummagen may be taken for the real?
Should we see so many unmarried
daughters and should we hear of so
many young men declassed by mar
riages out of their social spheres were
the English homes less stiff and inac

heads should be filled too early with
ideas of a possible husband, but the
fact must be faced that "nature abhors
a vacuum," and If no Ideal be placed
in the empty frame oÂ£ the fancy-free,
it is liable to be filled with the false
representations of any ignorant girl or
woman with whom she comes In con
tact, and she Is thus liable to fall down
and worship the first image that pre
sents itself. Who has not seen a girl
fall captive to the wiles of her- music
master? She is shy of telling her par
ents of the charm the man has for her,
she becomes enslaved to her fancy, and
while the mother Is still boasting of
her daughter being impervious to the
attractions of the other sex, her heart
is taken captive, and it is only after
marriage that the clay feet of her Idol
are discovered.
In this gymnastic age, professors in a
more athletic art are sometimes the at-?
traction, and I heard this week of a
girl's devotion to her fencing master,
who Is anything but an eligible person.
By no means do I wish to say that
either a music, a fencing, or any other
master need be ineligible as a husband,
but if ineligible, they have great oppor
tunities for gaining an Influence over
the inexperienced. I would, therefore,
only remind mothers that their daugh
ters are, even as they were, on the
quest of the ideal, and if .their con
fidences are encouraged instead of
snubbed, they will learn to distinguish
between a true and an Inverted ideal.
Let, then, the first fruits of 'the imagin
ation ripen in the sunshine of sympathy
instead of rotting In the chill of silence.
Certainly many married couples do
not represent the "Ewige Geliebte," de
scribed by Beethoven, but inverted as
the image may be in many cases, it
does not prevent the existence of the
ideal.
The image of his father's ship was,
Â¦we hear, inverted in the mirage seen
by Captain Scoresby in his expedition
off the coast of Greenland, but it proved
to be truly the reflection of the ship
in which his father was drifting An de
spair, and the tight of the reflection
led to the sailor being found.
Distorted the ideal may be by the
clouds and false ideas of life, but this
does not nullify the reality of the ideal.

5other about Beatrice which mad* hav
ever so awfully Jovabla. He Clint
know himself exactly what It wu, but
it was. and that was all ha neÂ«d*d to
know.
Well, to get to the point, Abner saved
his money until he. waa strong Â«nouÂ«a
to go Into business for himself. And
as he calculated that there was more
room for a new store in New York City
than there was in Hazel Green, ha
pulled up stakes and made for the biff
town.
It was agreed between him and Bea
trice that as soon as hi cot every thing
in tip-top shape he would wire her to
come on and they would "be married In
Grace Church, so that there would be
a big piece in the papers about It.
For the first few weeks New York
City was just about all Abner could
stand. He worked In his store from
daylight till dark, and spent the even
ings In his room writing wishy-washy
slush-gush-mush to the mainspring of
his heart. He was weak from home
sickness and cotild not retain anything
more nourishing than a cabinet photo
of Beatrice.
When Abner got things the way he
wanted them, he decided to rush down
to the telegraph office and concentrate
the .glad tidings into ten words. Not
having seen the main street during
daylight he chose to foot it.
As he Stepped into the thoroughfare
and got his first glance at the smartly
attired damsels he almost lost _^ his
breath. Before he had covered the first
block he was almost willing to admit
that some of them were as pretty as
Beatrice. Before he had , gone two

that her connections were of the very'
best/ . : .
Abner was a very valuable man to his
firm. A whole lot of folks said It
wouldn't surprise them at all to see
Philpott, Hargis & Snodgrass go to the
wall if he ever. took the notion into his
head to quit them. But they argued
that he. wouldn't do that, for he had
been with them ever since Wllse Gilma
not shot Colonel Jett Cockrill, and they
always gave him a ten dollar gold piece
for Christmas and let him have what
ever he wanted out of the stock at ac
tual cost. Furthermore, when he was
taken down with slow fever and did not
round-to for a whole month, his salary
went on Just the same as if he had
earned it, which was mighty kind Â£of
Philpott, Hargis & Snodgrass, insomuch

sixty dollars a month.

was never so much in her element. as

to call in a policeman to hold

tireless helper found time occasionally
to sort out a few combustible thoughts
THE LOVER WHO SULKED
[By Billy Burgundy*
(Copyright;? 1903, by "Albert" Britt)
It has been intimated above that she
was a more or less proud parent of a
limited edition of humanity in the
shape of a son. When she started out
on her devastating career of dredging
the depths of poverty and vice along
the Bowery she had turned her tender
offspring over to a select school for the
Instruction of the unfortunate scions
of bullionocracy. It was her theory
that a boy who had the good Judgment
to. select the right kind of parents
couldn't possibly fly. the track or get
his signals mixed. Imagine her pained
surprise, therefore, on her. return from
one of her, periodical excursions into
the murky depths of ' East Houston
street ; to learn , that her son hafl cov
ered himself with glory and large black
and blue spots as the leader of a gang
of amateur bandits who had held up a
candy store at the combined muzzles
of ,a Flobert rifle and an Iron dumb
bell and had lifted $3 37 but of the
cash drawer. It was her sad fate to
learn that while she was engaged in
saving the heathen on "the other side of
town, i her son had been ' acquiring a
large library of carefully, selected yel
low-backs, subsisting meanwhile o'n a

THE SLUMP OF A SLUMMER
The second reason rand it is a very
grave one) for the general discourtesy
between the sexes, is the springing up
in our midst of a class of women,- al
ways married, usually middle-ag-ed,
who refuse. to. grow old gracefully and
decently, and whose manners may be
described as carneying or fascinating,
according to taste, but who will submit
to any sort of treatment, brutality
even, rather than let go of men who
The woman who." looking back on a
successful career that has had no love
in Â«t, counts herself happy, is not a
woman at all. but a freak of nature, in
which something warm and human has
by accident been left out, rendering her
frustrate and incomplete.
There is. of course, a certain minority
of women who honestly do not wish
to marry, and mistrust all men, but
again the question arises, have men
sufficiently tried to overcome their
prejudices, and do they not unduly (lat
ter themselves on their brain and will

state?
round: thus a vast surplus of women
have no chance of marriage and moth
erhood, which is the state for which â¢
they were born, nature having em- ,
phatically laid down the law that for
every Jill there .should be a Jack, and '
so a chance of happiness afforded her.
Nothing tames and sweetens a wo-_
man like love; to be wooed, to be com- \
panioned, to know herself first with
one human being is thÂ»? supreme joy.
and though the woman without a lover
may not be actually conscious of Ihis
want, will even fiercely deny it3 exist
ence, still it is thero. embittering itvA
hardening her, till at last her speech,
and gait correspond with the defiant,
starved heart within her. Let thÂ»? right
man take the ajrsrcssive toward .
the most self-wilkc', the most'
self-contained worr.si!i of them
all. and teach her love, and she
will soften hour by hour before his
eyes; love gives humility, endows with
charm, her manner. Informed ty her

of woman who treats man a3 an ene
my because she secretly warts him as
a lover, whereas the born old maid re
mains neutral and tepid all her life
long, neither to be sweetened nor
Boured by man. since he does not enter
into her Bcheino of existence.
Briefly them, what is the reason of
this falling off in good breeding in both
women and men?
There are three reasonsâ of which
this is the first and most Important,
that there are not enough men to go
If you happen en a dewy-soft, mod
est, sv.ect little face, you may be pretty
cure that it came straight from the
country, and will shortly return there,
for it is only in town that I affirm this
rarity of beautyâ the place where free
dom of gait and thought is carried to
such lengths that "I care for nobody
no. not I, And nobody cares for me,"
may well appear to be the guiding mot
to of women. Men complain that when
they offer some such slight act of cour
tesy to women as grandpa and even
father offered as a matter of course,
they do not receive one word of thanks
or acknowledgment, consequently the
pretty-mannered women (and they are
yet to be found) have to suffer for the
.rudeness of their sisters â and are
tarred with the same brush of man's
disgust.
On the one hand you hear bitter com
plaints of decline in men's manners; on
the other, men talk contemptuously of
th* change for the worse in wompn's;
yet. when all is said and done, it is the
mistress or the daughter of the house
>vho gives the tone to the manners of
the men who live in or visit it. Where
the women are careless, immodest, ill
bred, mocking at all the gracious amen
ities and restraints of social and family
life, there will be found men only too
willing to let themselves go on in their
company, gladly discarding those re
straints that formerly hid their seamy
Eide, as much from themselves as from
others. Thus a moral support of incal
culable value is withdrawn, for to leave
off one's manners is equivalent to never
changing one's clothes at the proper
times, ar.d just as a slovenly negligence
of the person inevitably degrades and
undermines it, so does a careless bear
ing tend to similar conduct, and rapid
deterioration of character.
IS the decay ot pretty manners in
women nowadays, to put it plainly,
to be found in the absence of pretti
ncss in the women themselves? The
streets are filled with fine, athletic
girls, but the pretty little girl, with her
Emile, her blush, her little foot and
hand, her gracious "ways," her thanks
for some small service rendered, where
is she?
She has vanished from the highways
of the world, or it would seem that at
her first fluttering essay into the open,
she has boen pounced on. and hidden
away by greedy man for his own secret
joy and pride, himself a willing slave to
those winning arts that eo much more
appeal to his heart than the mannish
habits, th? cool insolence of the over
emancipated, over-athletic girls of to
day.
For the dismal fact remains that as
the health and growth of the female
race advances, beauty recedes, be
comes almost a lost quantity, as you
may easily ascertain by going on foot
for several successive days through the
West End of London, passing In review
the thousands of women driving, mo
toring, cycling, and on foot.
If during those days you see in all
half a dozen faces that fulfill your idea
of beauty in form, coloring and expres
sion, you are fortunate, but the
chances, one might almost say, the cer
tainties are, that you will meet miles of
tall, aggressive, striding lasses who
contemptuously shoulder you out of
their way, returning you cold glance for
glance, or crowds of carefully made-up
middle-aged women, whose attempts to
attract your admiration are even more
disagreeable than the total indifference
to your good or bad opinion displayed
by the "grenadiers" of the sex.
I do not say that such women are
met everywhere â there are vast tracts
of English. society into which they have
never penetrated, but that they exist
as a type is painfully well known to
many, a fresh young girl, who sees her
bit of pleasure filched from her by
those who, having eaten their cake, are
determined to have it also.
It is a misfortune, I know, to feel
take them about, amuse them, pay for
their menus plaisers, and give them
generally what they call "a good time"
â and at what a price!
Men arc not good., at; classification,
have not time to differentiate between
women and women, thus the pure
women are made to suffer for the fast,
the flighty, the ridiculous, and can only
withdraw into themselves, standing
apart from those who enjoy the pleas
ures flung to them by man's contempt
uous hand, having indeed no taste for
a familiarity that strikes at the very
root of their self-respect and womanli
ness.
There is something revolting in the
sight of clean, fresh-faced boys danc
ing attendance on women whose sons
are %t the same age as themselves â
youth to youthâ age to age â dignity to
the meridian of life, and the ripe charm
that experience gives, thus should it be
now, as It has in the past.
I is a hard saying, but it seems to me
that with our own dear mothers of the
last generation we buried all that are
left of the old-fashioned pattern, and
that until the present day women ini
tiate a vast forward movement _lo a
change in manner toward men so long
will men fail In theirs toward. the other
sex. The remedy lies iri^the women's
own hands â where shall they make a
beginning? , 'i; .* .
. From time immemorial they have
been the bulwark of the^country, whose
importance as rearers of sons and
daughters is more vital, more Impor
tant to the state than the statesmen
.themselves and without whom (should
they become universally corrupt) Eng
land must go to pieces, inevitably de
stroyed like other great nations, from
within.
For to keep the home together, to
look properly after husband and chil
dren, fulfilling daily a thousand acta of
duty that no cne else can, that is the
work for which woman was born, and
in the main -it is very strenuous work,
engaging every faculty of heart and
brain, and . not all the J successes of
Â¦women who usurp men's places and
. professions will leave the mark on pos
terity that this one, by the bringing up
of her sons, the molding of her hus
band, will.
There is a third reason for the decay
in courtesy between men and womenâ
and perhaps it is the saddest and moat
menacing to all our womanhood (be
ing as it is almost a direct result of the
r two reasons I have given above). It Is
when a qertain type of girl realizes
that in addition to the scarcity of men
her chances of marriage are still fur-
young Inside and be old out. but /there
are other ways of working off this
vitality than by aping Ninon de I*En
clos' airs, and is not the antagonistic
attitude of daughters to mothers now
adays,' often due to the total lack of
dignity with which these mothers be
have? #
at home, and to spare. Let her then,
with her sisters, turn over a new leaf-â
the grandmothers discard their vrigm
and capering foolishnesses, the married
women who cannot live without admir
ation turn to the' cultivation of their
homes, the girls who are contemptu
ously allowed to share men's pleasure*
emigrate, and become honest wives of
honeit men; then, though there must
still remain a vast amount of bus oring.
Incomplete womanhood, we may . look
for a'return of those pretty mannars In
women that men secretly cherish so
deeply, and to meet which their.hom
age, so Ions forgotten.' will Inevitably,
spring again. HELEX lliTHEBS.
If a man of breeding (and though some
female members of the -aristocracy set
the worst examples of all. their men
who despise them, never show It) he
will keep silence, and only by his avoid
ance of women show his contempt for
them, but the harshest misogynist of
them all may have all the harm light
women have done him undone by a sin
gle good one, and if he go sufficiently
far afield he can still find her.
For as surely as violets hide under
their green leaves, and come back year
by year to rejoi'ce our hearts, so surely
do good, pretty and charming girls lurk
in this island of ours, only awaiting tha
resolute seeker, breathing that atmos
phere of womaliness, of charm, natural
to them as the perfume is to the violet,
being the emanation of physical, moral
and mental health. From them you
will get the old fashioned, pretty man
ner that answered so much better with
our mothers and grandmothers, that
â¢answered so much better (in the mat
ter of lovers) than the rude, the car
neying and the so-called fascinating
one of to-day.
Roughly, then, we may divide women
into two classes nowadays, those who
use violent, and meretricious means to
attract men for mercenary purposes,
and women who deliberately revolt men
by their aggressively rude manners,
claiming not only an equal status, but
an actual super!arity over them in phy
sique, brains and position, so that one
might suppose their aim to be a race
of brainy Amazons, placing pigmy man
behind them for protection and patron
age.
That women must work Is one of tha
sad conditions of their overpowering
numbers; it may also be taken as
granted that no woman llk.es Ions and
sustained effort, for which, as fashioned
by nature, she is eminently unfitted;
still she can do that work quietly If she
pleases, and there is no need to'antag
onize by her^attltude the only legiti
mate worker In the open market that
God and nature ever Intendedâ man. . |
As I said before, work she has enough
ther reduced by the depredations
older women, and too often she be
comes a free lance, picking up eagerly
a bit of pleasure here and there and
gradually cheapening herself to the res
taurant or the theater, the smoke and
the whisky-and-soda girl, who no more
exacts fine manners from man than ha
expects them- of her. Probably there is
no real vice in her, but knowing that
there is no fun possible to her without
a man to take her about, she drifts Into
a false position, and sometimes, very
rarely, is married by a man whose rep
utation is as off-color as her own. For
men worth having decline to mVrry the
girls who place their good looks, their
charm, their agreeable company at the
disposal uf chance comrades. As a rule
a man marries because he wants some
particulai -woman all to himself, but is
it to be wondered at that between his
disgust at grandmothers, who ape the
manners of girls of 16, and contempt for
the facile girls who will go anywhere,
do anything he pleases, a man's
own manners and self-restraint deterio
rate, and he decides not to marry at
all?
With the whole dessert, laid on thÂ»
table before him. he reckons that hÂ«
would be a fool to sit down for the rest
of his life with an especial fruit or diet,
and. often disgusted I with the profu
sion, he turns his back on the banquet
and will have none of it.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CAIT.
ON THE DECAY OF PRETTY MANNERS IN WOMEN
6Franz Josef, Keystone
of Empire.
Mies Bcnner's novel, "To-morrow's
Tangle," is the best story of California
since Norris wrote "The Octopus." It
is good because it touches upon an as
pect of early California life which has
never been developed, the raw, unlovely
aristocracy cf the bonanza kings which
held sway twenty-five years ago. This
unique class of American society, with
its open display of wealth and Its close
ly housed family skeletons, has now en
tirely passed away and only the great
brown stone palaces remain as me
mentoes of Its gilded existence. Miss
Bonner has wisely woven a story out
cf these tinsel threads which reflects
a perfect image of the life that was
here with the Mackays, the Floods and
the Fairs.
The author opens her story with a
dramatic episode upon the Utah desert.
A Mormon with his two wives Is
crawling over the limitless plains of
sand to golden California when a death
end a birth come with startling sudden
ness to that stricken wag-on. Then the
Mormon trades his enfeebled wife with
her new-born babe for a pair of fresh
horses and passes on down the moun
tains and out of the story temporarily.
That introduction of Mist Bonner's is
somewhat daring, bu*t altogether force
ful and of clever invention.
The body of the Btory deals wltL the
life of this child of the Utah desert
gTown into a handsome woman and
thrown u 4 -n her own resources by the
death of those who had reared her. The
fe-1. Mariposa, learns that one of the
millionaire kings of the crested society
of San Francisco is the father who had
traded herself and her mother for a
pair of horses back in her infancy. This
unpleasant fact forms the rainspring
cf the s.ory. ' i- ".'""-.
The character of Mariposa. the blg
llmbetl, full-blooded ' California girl
with spirit and independence a-plenty,
is excellently drawn. Mits Bonner
gives her heroine the spirit of an Ama
zon. She creates a -character, uncon
ventional, spirited, engaging, naive. The
best thing about Mariposa Is that she
Beerns to rule her author rather than
to be directed by her.
Besides Mariposa, Miss Bonner has
ample opportunity to sketch character
in Essex, the literary dilettante and lib
ertine; Mrs. Willers, the frowzy news
paper woman, and the whole fund of
the Garcia household. But the author
has erred upon the side of allowing too
free a play to her desire for character
delineation. She is prolix in several
places; she has crowded her book

woman, who was really a second Maria

writer's admiration, for she was all

Of the attempted classic outline of
raiment for the fair ones during the
Empire period Mrs. Earle writes with
didactic energy. That the fad, for
classic, clinging draperies in vogue
just a hundred years ago swung nearly
to the limit of an Eden simplicity Is
reflected In the well-kÂ«own portrait of
Madame Recamier. Mrs. Earle: thinks
that our great-grandmotheis were Im
modest
After earning her clothes history
up to the end of the first decade of the
last century Mrs. Earle leaves kanga
roo waists anil straight fronts for fu
ture antiquarians to expatiate upon.
The-worth of her work she ( bases upon
the argument that to know history
well one must know costume. "Nor
could any one write upon dress with
discrimination and balance unless he
know thoroughly the dress of ail coun
tries, and likewise the history of all
countries."

when a work-in two bulky, volumes
would be brought forth v or. the sub
ject of clothes. Lucky is it for Alice
Morse Earle that the choleric philoso
pher of clothes is now dust and that
her "Two Centuries of. Costume in
America" may appear unassailed by so
unmerciful a pen. For what says the
ascetic "Sartor"?
"Neither In tailoring nor in legis

dent, but the hand is ever guided on by
mysterious operations of the mind. In

arate sections and front the world an
Agglomeration of four limbsâ will de
pend on the nature of such Architect
ural Idea." , When such classic irony as
this "towers up" in grim warning
against the foibles of habiliments Alice
Morse Earle has bravery of no mean
measure to claim authorship of a work
upon human husks.
The sartorial antiquary is a new fig
ure In the modern order of things book
ish. Away back in the eighteenth cen
tury such old grubbers as Stubbs, and
Malcolm wrote dissertations upon the
history of knee breeches and the treat
ment of the human hairâ possibly be
cause they had nothing else to do; but
it is a question If the modern reader
needs 1200 pages of Illustrated text upon
crinolines and night rails to add to his
happiness In life. "Two Centuries of
Costume" would be an invaluable aid
to Charles Major or Mary Johnston In
the preparation of a new historical
novel; they could be correct in their
clothing of another Dorothy Vernon or
an Audrey. Beyond that It must be
said that the book will have little more
appeal to popular fancy than a spin
ning wheel which "came over In the
Mayflower."
At first jump Mrs. Earle wishes to
combat the fallacy entertained about
the somberneES of our Puritan fore
fathers' dress. Though their worthy
pastors condemned colors as one of the
sins of the flesh, the flocks were wont
to stray, according to the author. She
says:
"When I think of my sturdy Puritan
forbears in the summer planting of Sa
lem and of Boston, I see them in 'hon
est russet kersey,' gay, too, with the
bright stamell red*of their waistcoats
and the grain red linings of mandil
lions; scarlet capped are they and en
livened with many a great scarlet
hooded cloak.
"The Puritan church, indeed, preach
ed simplicity of dress: but the church
attendants never followed that preach
ing. Even In the nrst years the set

Character drawing is pre-eminently
Miss Manning's forte. In her "Judith
of the Plains," the character sketches
alone would serve to make a book with
out the assistance of the slender
thread of romance which binds them
into a plot.
The book is a cowboy tale â a story of
the great air and boundless plains of
the West. The life upon the big Wy
oming cattle ranges Is, perhaps, drawn
with too high a coloring, but it is ef
fective.
Humor finds a place here and there
In Miss "Manning's story. Leander Dax,
the brow-beaten husband, seems a
strajigely pathetic figure in this bold
Western canvas. Mrs. Yellett, with her
aphorisms from "The Book of Hiram,"
is another quaint touch. But Judith is
the personage par excellence â Judith,
the half-breed girl with the half-wild,
untrammeled nature and the stoic cour
age. This is a great piece of character
limning, this Judith.

the nathos, the woe, the untold but
clearly written misery of centuries In
these cliff-built houses of the mesas,
these residences that are fortresses,
these steep trail approached and preci
pice ( protected , homes. In a desert
land, surrounded by relentless, wary
and vigilant foes,.. ever fighting a hard
battle with the adverse conditions of
their environment, short of water and
firewood, and with food In the
desert-rescued lands below, where at
an/, moment the ruthless marauder
might appear, there Is no wonder that
almost every elderly face is" seamed
and scarred; furrowed deeply with the
accumulated centuries of never-ceasing
care. Mystery here seems at first to
reign supreme. It stands and faces one
as a Presence. It hovers and broods
and you feel It even in your sleep.
The* air is full of It. The very clouds
here ! are mysterious, j Who are these
people? Whenpe came they? What is
their destiny? What fearful battles,
race hatreds, devastating wars, led
them to make their homes on these In
accessible cliffs?"
The author has found the desert In
dians a quiet, fairly Industrious people
who are skilled In agricultural and
stock-raising pursuits. It will surprise
many to learn that for many centuries
they have known the benefits of scien
tific Irrigation, and have practiced It
extensively. :
The men and women ar* expert
swimmers and are brought up in the
saddle. They very carefully practlc*
physical culture and have wonderful
powers of endurance. Every morning
at break of day the young men prac
tice running, these exercises amount
ing to a run of from fifteen to twenty
miles before .breakfast. This will ex
plain how It is that for a dollar trav
elers can employ an Indian to carry
letters across the desert a distance of
90 or 100 miles within twenty-four
hours. Many of their recorded feats
in this respect are almost incredible.
The Indians are very superstitious
and religious. They are pantheists, sun
worshipers and snake dancers. They
have powerful medicine men, also pray
ing wheels. like the Burmese and Thi
betans, and they are addicted to the
practice. of witchcraft and sorcery.
In one singular respect they ara
ahead of us. They recognize women's
"rights." The whole home life, of the
-desert Indians is based upon the rights
of women. The women own the houses
and property; the wife â¢ receives her 1
newly, married . husband into her own
home; th* children belong to her clan
and take her clan name; any food
brought into the home by the husband
at once becomes her property. She is
truly, queen of her home and, unlike
most aborigines, - she Is In every re
spect placed on equal terms with her
husband.
Among the arts practiced by the In
dians are weaving, basket making,
carving and pottery making. Their
blankets are finely mad* and greatly
sought by traders. Their baskets are
mado from yucca fibers and willow
wood. The ornamentation Is chiefly
in geometrical designs, which are gen
erally symbolical. Their pottery Is sim
ilarly â decorated. All their art .works
are skillfully and tastefully executed.
James has given great attention to
the religious mysteries and ceremonies
annually practiced by these people. His
chapter treating on the dances and per
formances of the snake and antelope
priests, which is a fine example of vig
orous word painting, will be found ex
ceedingly entertaining.
The author has succeeded In getting
Into the 26S pages of his book a com
plete '.storehouse of -Indian wonders.
He relates th* "Â¦:. exploits of travelers,
stories of Indian battle and hunting
scenes and sports. He describes the
glorious colored scenes during the ris

the awful â¢: terrors of , the sandstorms
that often devastate the region. James
adds iomÂ« of his own and other trav

Three Western Stories
of Some Merit.
SHE first question asked by the
prospective purchaser of a new
novel is: Where is the plot laid?
In these days the art of story
writing has been so highly spe
cialized that we have the Southern
school, the New England school, the
Xew York school and so forth. Each
treat section of the country has now
ita novel typical of the life lived there
in. Local color la becoming more and
more the distinguishing feature of our
present day novels.
Of these schools of the novel there is
one which is coming more and more
Into prominence. That Is the great
Western novel field. After Bret Harte's
time the typical red shirt and buckskin
trousers story of the Weit languished
until within tha last year or two the
fr*sh. quickening spring of the buoyant
Uf* of prairie and mountain has again
b*ccme one of the dominant notes In
our lighter literature. Perhaps It was
Owen Wlster who set in fashion the
new Western story; It might have been
Frederic Remington or Alfred Henry
Lewis. Certain It Is that there have
b*en written some 6tories of the trans-
MlssiBsippl region which have been rep
resentative of the highest effort in the
novel.
Three recent books there are which
are of this Western field. Widely differ
ing in character though they may be,
these three are all founded upon the
typical Western spirit of restless en
ergy, that characteristic which makes
them kin. "Mr. Salt." by Will Payne,
is a novel of the terrible rush and wel
ter cf business life in Chicago; "To
morrow's Tangle." by Geraldine Bon
ner. Is of breezy San Francisco in the
'70's, and Marie "Manning's "Judith of
the Plains" depicts present day' exist
ence on Wyoming's plains.
In his novel, "Mr. Salt," TVill Payne
has not achieved unqualified success.
His desire to picture the tremendous
pressure of the great financial engine
has borne very creditable fruitage; but
the characters In his story, with the
possible exception of Salt himself, are
cut out of strawboard. The quick suc
cession of stirring incidents alone pre
vents the reader from closing the
book's covers at the fourth or fifth
chapters.
lir. Payne has the very laudable
j>urpose of making a heroine out of a
stenographer and right manfully does
he endeavor to add a dash of heroics
to her shorthand. But to no purpose;
Earner is altogether of the earth.
Â«*arthy, and will not make any attempt
to look beyond the top of her type
writer. When at last she warns her
employer of a plot against his life and
the Ptr;:^p:ling Mr. Payne has almost
caused the white light of heroism to
beat from the stenographic head, the
recalcitrant Ksther shies fearfully and
refuses to become the wife of her mil
lionaire lover. Then even Payne
loses heart and drops his heroine for
three whole chapters.
Salt, the stock plunger. Is well done.
The author portrays the fearfully pug
nacious daring of this master genius on
'change with a simple strength which
is convincing. The only note which
seems to ring a trifle false in this con
ception of Salt is that very love af
fair with his typewriter. Not that
such things are not, but a giant of
finance such as Salt does not mingle
the divine passion with his business
as a rule.
Aside from the stiff-backed char
acters, the etory which Mr. Payne has
spun about "the street" In Chicago
is m. good one. In liveliness of action
end vividness of portrayal it can be
easily ranked with Frank Norris' "The
Pit" In some feature it is very like
the second story of the wheat.

A Few Current' Topics
About Writers.
mHERE has lately been pub-
I Ilshed In Paris a letter by Balzac
I relating to his candidature for the
\ Academy, written in 1S43. The
novelist was disgusted to find that
his poverty was proving an ob
stacle In his path, and to his friend.
M. de Pougerville, himself an Academi
cian, he wrote: "If fortitude In an up
hill struggle. If the Independence which
refuses to exchange labor for Irritat
ing government protection, if poverty,
constitute an obstacle to my election,
then I ought never to offer myself
whin fortune shall have ' favored me.
It would be as discreditable for me as
for the Academy that gold should give
a claim higher than that of a Ufa de
voted to literature. â¢ â¢ â¢ You will
approve. I trust, an attitude dictated
by the self-respect Inseparable from
one's own good name."
An interesting comparison between
Baldwin Sears' "The Circle in the
Square" and Thomas Nelson Page's
"Red Rock" is made by a recent critic,
who says: "From Its remarkable pene
tration and portrayal of feelings and
their expression, and from its strong
and sustained grasp, not only of char
acter but of a great problem. The Cir
cle in the Square' deserves to be con
sidered a legitimate successor to 'Red
Rock' as a document on the conditions
of Southern life."

recent expedition up Mount McKlnley.
conies home with some very interesting
anecdotes of the. human side of explor
ation. Mr. Dunn is a popular young
Harvard graduate, who has done some
striking magazine articles on outdoor
life. He Is embodying his recent thrill-
Ing experiences in a series of papers
which will appear* In Outing during th*
coming year. The first of a series an
nounced for the January Outing will
be a stirring narrative of his thrilling
experiences recorded In the stress of th*
moment, portraying the thing as it was.
Its passions, hopes and fears. Th*
series should be a notable one.
Mrs. Katherlne Cecil Thurston, au
thor of "The Circle," whose now novel.
"The Masquerader," begins its first in
stallment in the January number of
Harper's Bazar, was born in Cork, in
the south of Ireland. She was an only
child, educated at home and much
given to reading. Strangely enough. In
view of the success of her first novel,
Mrs. Thurston avers that the thought
of writing never came to her until it
was suggested by her husband, who Is
hlmseH an author. Mrs. Thurston re
sides altogether In London, making a
pilgrimage each year to her own coun
try. It was in the quaint and primitive
village of Ardmore, on the south coast
of Ireland, that the greater part of
"The MasqSerader", .was Â¦written.

the physician of the retreat, and it. was
â¢ decided that he was fit once more to

At the time when Milly Matches first
joined the Order of the .Penitents in
the refuge of which the great Noaker
was warden the great Noakt-r was not
fulfilling the duties of that office for
his "health." The warden of such a
refnge Is commonly expected to find it
or to make it a "good thing"; and
deeply as the scribes deplore the facts/
they are compelled In Justice to state
that he had paid for the opportunity.
For the, rest, they permit* themselves
to record certain conversations and bita
of narrative which came to their knowl

ous Minick. , â¢ .â ,-
Thomas Burpee and William Marts,
the two great- personages in striped
clothes that Mlnick included in his list
of distinguished acquaintances, were
men whom he found very valuable to
interview when there was an addition
to the Order of the Penitents. Although
they might not know the newcomer
personally, if he had any zeal stand
ing In the underworld society . they
were^ pretty likejy" to be able- to tell
the degree\of his distinction, and to*
estimate more or less " correctly the
probable amount of "fall .money" it

It was the opinion^of Thomas- Bur-'
pee and "William - Marts, particularly
because they knew the class be be
longed to, and partially because they
had heard of some of his. most recent
enterprises,' that Milly Matches was a
penitent Who would be' glad to ray hard
cash for mitigations "of " discipline.
Therefore," Minick made haste to have
an 'interview with the omnipotent and
worldly-wise Noaker. ' . . - :
; "You mean thejsman has the stuff ?".
asked Noaker, after -Mlnick had. told
him of the reported financial status of
Milly. *.
"That's what Burpee and Marts say."
"It ain't hardly right for a. man to
have the stuff and not to learn- the use
of it. Seems Irreligious like, an' a kind
o* buryin'- his talent." - -
"Think Hell's Kitchen; # ud learn

When Harold Diprcse left the side

he lost his hold for a moment on; the
small valise in which he carried his

the young men. solicitously lingering.
"Not at all," said. Diprose.
"We were rushing to keep a date, but
rve did intend to. take time to look
xvnere we were going,!', said the other
young man, bareheaded, while he
smoothed the nap of his hat with his
coat sleeve.
"I ought to have looked where I was
going myselfâ as much my fault as
yours." said Diprose cordially. "If you
stay to explain you will miss your
date."
"Good af ternoon." said the young men
together, and entered the cab.
"Good morning." said Diprose, and
he made his tray to the office of the
A. A. and B., where he discovered that
the small valise he held in his hands
was not the same, except to the eye,
as the small valise he had dropped on
the . pavement, and that the contents
thereof were not the same, nor of
equal value; and all of any conse
quence that he could remember of the
tvro young men was that they both
had sandy bearers neatly trimmed and
hands neatly srloved.
Therefore the illustrious Minick ar
rested John Eladen snd let him go
The next morning John Bladen was
unable to present himself at the offices
of the A. A. and B., and he stated later
that he must have been glve.n "peter
drops." but in support of this state
ment he could give the officials of the
A. A. and B nothing whatever but his
Â¦word.
Harold Diprose. paymaster of the A.
A. and B., was accustomed the first of
every month to draw a considerable
sum in the private omce of Abbadie
& Co., bankers and brokers, which he
took up the line to be distributed on
the different divisions. He usually was
accompanied by one John Bladen, mis
cellaneous athlete and special officer
not In uniform, by way of body guard.
The e\'ening before the robbery occur
red John Bladen fell into a conversa

IT is a matter of course that Mrs.
Minick was the efficient cause of
her man's prosperity. It is the the
ory in the United States that every

scribes, who are scrupulously careful
to avoid scandal, profess unbounded
belief in that theory. Mrs. Minick

she made him "hustle the dusL"
"I want that apartment up in Har

told you," declared Sadie.
"Ain't I square with my money?"
asked Minick. "Don't I divvy with
you on the level?"
"I ain't complaining about what you
do with the money you got; I'm simply
telling you that we got to get more."
"How much more do we peed?"
'â¢All we can get. -
The illustrious Minick was a special
detective in the cab case of the A. A.
and B. Railway. He made no progress
in the case for some time, except in
the matter of lengthening the expense
account, which the railway officials
subsequently audited and allowed. He
and Mrs. Minick took a little jaunt to
Atlantic City, where they stayed a week
till the "hot wave" passed. The rail
way officials did not see the expenses
of that trip in the account which they
audited, but they were there. The rail
way officials were too much concerned
about bringing the guilty parties to
Justice to show themselves difficult
about details. The facts of the case as
they appeared in the public prints at
the time are these:
"I told you what you could do if
you'd only Lustle for the dust." she
said. "Please, Mr. Old Sleuth, hustla
tome rurt!"
The bills were identified and Harold
Diprose did swear to Milly's mug.
Shorty Hoolan was taken into custody
some weeks later, and once more the
public prints pronounced Detective
Mlnick a second Old Sleuth and Sher
lock Holmes. What was of more con
sequence both to Detective Minick and
really to the future execution of the
law, there was a thrill of pride and
pleasure in the bosom of Mistress Sadie,
who, by the way, received in the public
prints no credit whatever.
They broke open the door. Milly
was taking a desperate chance. He
was still perfectly in Minick's power,
and. the instant he led the way to the
hiding-place of the treasure he had
played his last card. But even in the
.under world the life of business 13

trust, and he preferred to trust Ml

and fu!l. of the smell of the dank saw
dust and decayed wood that lay deep
and soft under foot.- Milly went
.straight to one corner, where he
kneeled dov/n and du~ in the sawdust
with his hands. At the end of a
minute he lifted out a box. wrapped in
oilcloth, onened It and displayed it
full of packages of bank notes. As he
did so Minlck steoped swiftly and
snapped a pair of handcuffs on his
wrists and drew a revolver.
"It's all off. Milly; you're the moke
tmit pulled ofT that A. A. and B. touch.
If you'd had that dough you'd never
'a' touched the theater, and between

he? It's your one chance; take it or
leave It,- and be quick about it."
M lily's face was not good to look
upon, but neither was Minick's.
"You're puttin' up a damn big bluff.
You dos't know what I'd toueh an'
what I wouldn't *nor where I got. ray

"If the bills can't be identified and

"Wlllyou let Tie mooch if i tell you
with my half of the stuff?"
"Sure!"
"Shorty Hoolan." . ;
"Thanks," said Mlnick, "you're easy.
Now well go back to the peal Steady
there, you idiot."
Milly had given an Inarticulate cry
of rage and made a break for the door.
Mlnick caught him and beat him into
a sitting posture with the butt of his
revolverâ onceâ twiceâ about the head.
The two friends separated.
The" following morning Minlck en
tered the retreat of the penitents look
ing somewhat bulky, but no one chal
lenged his right to enter. He was un
derstood to be getting "wise." and the
powers that rule are permitted eccen
tricities in dress as well as In manner
when "wisdom" is the thing sought
after. The season was not cold, but
before leaving his lodgings to visit
Milly it stands recorded that he dressed
himself -in two complete suits of
clothes. A half hour after his depart
ure from the prison there was conster
nation among the employes at the
freight house of the Railroad. Cer
tain shoe boxes from the penitentiary
had been delivered, the team's had
driven away and the workmen were
about to load the boxes Into the cars
when a crash of splintered wood was
heard and Milly Matches made an ap
pearance from nowhere. The workmen
were tow dumfounded to do anything
but stand with open mouths and stare,
and Milly walked unconcernedly into
the railway yards and was lost in the
multitude of cars by the time the
freight, hands realized that an escaped
penitent had been among them. Had
they, watched closely they might have
noticed the .illustrious Mlnick also in
the . neighborhood, keeping the man
from nowhere carefully in sight. What
they could not have seen, unless they
had given quick pursuit, was both men
entering a cab together and driving
rapidly. away. For the first ten min
utes the. cabby seemed perfectly to
know- where he was going. Later he
received, directions from Milly, and
drew refn at last at the edge of a wood,
where both men alighted. When he had
been dismissed Milly led the way to a
bit of d lake by which there stood and
stands an abandoned icehouse. ,

much to himself in this work, and was
able to make experiments. In about a
week he was convinced that with a
little squeezing a shoe box carefully
constructed might shield a man's body
from rain and storm at least until he
was outside of the prison walls. This
conclusion was. in itself. ,of no seeming
interest to any one. least of all to the
Illustrious Mlnick. but Milly displayed
a lively impatience to consult the Illus
trious Minlck in regard to these Ideas.
It was just possible that the physician
had been wrong and that Milly was
still crippled under the hat. A bit of
the dialogue between Milly and Detect
ive Mlnick, when next they met, might
have seemed to confirm the possibility.
"Can't nail the top on myself; I
8'pose Timlin can do it unless he's for
got how to wink," said Milly.
Why he was not as fit as Timlin to
drive a nail, and wherein remembering
to wink was essential to that operation,
did not appear.

The washable satin shirt waists, too,
will play an -important part, for here
one gets all the Â¦ appearance of satin
with all the advantages of the wash,
waist. Washable satin comes at low
prices and it makes up into shirt
waists that are beautiful for general
wear, for they are dressy yet Quietly
elegant, thus differing from many of
the very fancy materials Â¦ which come
for. the making of shirt waists.
My Lady In the Flowered 6111c
' Maud need not go into the garden to
gather roses this summer, for she can
pick ' them right off the waist of her
silk gown. Beautiful silk shirt waist*,
all covered with a pattern of small
roses, are made up in the .fashionable
shirt waist designs and are placed in
th4' shop windows, there to beckon in
the passerby to purchase them.
The- embroidered flowers are by all
odds the most elegant, but the little
flowered silks are pretty and they make
up Into very neat little waists for all
around wear. These, If made of soft
silk, will go very nicely under a heavy
coat and will come out as good as new,
on wrinkled and smart. ,. They, make
these soft "silks with _ a box plait In
front, through which there are made
large buttonholes to accommodate
handsome' silver-rimmed buttons, \ and
they make them with masses ; of,tuck

-closed. front and with back buttoned in

Many of the handsomest of the new
waists depend largely upon their but
tons for, their^ style.: Buttons made of
Japanese , embroidery are set in silver
rtm*,^ and* they' make ; almost a whole
trimming i'ot r themselves. And then
there are buttons that 'are formed by
covering button shapes of silk, and
around - these ; are set - dull gold rims,
making a sort of picture button for the
.trimming of the waist.
\ It Is safe to say that buttons will play
a very important part in the silk waists
of spring, and that fringes and metallic
decorations will be ; seen a great : deal
One costly waist was In deep red
silk embroidered with deep blue flow
ers. There were so profusely scattered
over the surface of the silk that you
could hardly put your; 'finger down
without touching' a flower. 'â¢Â«Â¦- The
bloused part of the waist, the part
Just over the belt, was stiff with hand
embroidery and the sleeve puffs stood
out without any other stiffening than
that afforded by. the needle of the em
broiderer. >
Perhaps graceful would be the best
description of the shirt waist as It is
now seen. It is a picture waist in
many respects, but it is a very reflned
picture, without one discordant note.
More than anything else Is embroid
ery used. In fact the laces are giving
way somewhat to the embroidery fad
;and whole waists are covered with
istitchery and sleeves are made fairly
(heavy with it. There are waists
which -are embroidered from side to
side and from one sleeve to the other
with scarcely an inch left uncovered.
I Shirt Waists at $100.
P In one of the handsomest Fifth
avenue shops the other day there was
a sale of shirt waists. Nearly fifty
were knocked down and off, the price
running from $100 to $150, far beyond
the reach of the average person. The
waists were in the Japanese colors and
were remarkable for the immense
amount of embroidery upon them.
Further than this they were In no way
for they were cut on very
tplain lines, with a slight blouse in the
Fxnlddle of the front * and the* wide
pouched sleeve.
A shirt waist which can sell for $100
Â¦without a particle of lace upon It'
must be remarkable in many ways and
these waists were dreams In color
contrasts and in the weight and the
tone of the silks that were used.
With this long front sweep, this
unbroken line from chin to belt, this
low shoulder effect and the great
wrist puffs, woman must do her ut
most to stand erect, or the grace of
this shirt waist will be /psL It is a
Â¦waist which requires a woman of fine
shoulders and wide, full belt.
Tlie waist, which was a fair speci
bmm of the shirt waist which is rap
idly coming in. was embroidered down
*uch t-ide of the front with a very del
icate white i-ine. unon which there
were many white flowers. . The vine
grew more luxuriant across the shoul
ders, and thus It managed to produce
the broad-shouldered. GIbsonesque
appearance. A little .tucking com
pleted the yoke and the shoulders.
It takes a peculiar knack to wear a
shirt waist well and specially will the
new spring shirt waists require some
talent in this direction. The general
characteristic of the waist is that it Is
lone in the front and is cut to give a
Â¦woman a great sweeping line from the
chin to the belt. It is also long on the
shoulders and everything possible is
done to gret the 1830 curve.
THE Gibson widow swept down
the middle of a fashionable tea
room the other day, wearing a
mole-colored linen shirt waist.
Its r.^atly embroidered turn
over cuffs set off a hand which was
mad*, j-mall by the great melon-shaped
Bteeve and the very tall and very trim
embroidered stock only served to
make more slender the slenderness of
u?r pretty neck.

"And yet another elbow finish Is that
of the Victorian ruffles, which consist
of three ruffles all the same length,
caught on the inside of the sleeve and
arranged so as to hang down, all of
equal length, over the undersleeve.
. "But these are only a few of the
many styles of new sleeves. Just at
this moment the prettiest sleeve Is the
cloth sleeve, with a cap of some con
trasting color. This Is put on in the
shape of an epaulette and the end is
continued right on down, to the very
cuff."
"If you want to finish your sleeves In
very fine fashion," continued the mod
iste, "cut them off at the elbow, let
{hem out in a full bell and. finish the
bell with a white cotton fringe. Above
the fringe sew a flat band of white silk
ribbon or white washable satin.
"There Is another way to- finish your
bell sleeve which should be only a little
longer than the elbow. Take it and
finish It in points and under each point
set a longer point of lace. Between the
points hang two white silk balls. This
makes a very dressy finish for the
sleeves.
"Sleeves will be of two kinds," said a
modiste,* "open and closed. One will be
about as fashionable as the other and
it will be a, question purely of ,cholce.
You can have the bell, which is flaring
at the elbow, and which 'Is to-be worn
over an undersleeve. Or you can have
the- great melon shaped sleeve, whlcTi
is caught in under a narrow cuff at
the wrist. For my, part I prefer the
elbow bell as dressier.

ail. of these in point of popularity Is the
heavy embroiflery of the year, which
has stepped from obscurity Into great
prominence and has become a very im
portant part of the wardrobe.
Waists That Close In the Back.
There is no denying the fact that the
majority of waists will dose in the
back. The youthful. appearance of the
long, plain, straight front is a thins
that Is beyond argument and where is
there a woman who will neglect that
which is a certain guarantee of youth
fulness?
Nine out of ten of the finer grades of
white waists close up In the back and
fully one-half of the linen and crash
waists are closed in the same manner.
The unhandiness of the waist which
buttons behind cannot be disputed. A
woman who lived In a hotel will, tell
you that it costs her ten cents every
time she puts on her waist, for the maid
mast hook it, and those who are travel
ing will assure you that the waist
which hooks up the back is an unmltlt
gated nuisance. Yet, after one look at
herself, and after one study of her
youthful lines, the woman who has
seen herself In one of those smooth
fronted waists will rush off to buy
another, for she knows that, in nothing
else, does she look half so well. - - v â¢-..
All waists are to be worn looser and
this will be good news for the woman
who is tugging at her back buttons
and the buttons will be larger and the
buttonholes more pronounced. Instead
of being hidden under a slat they will
stand out bold and pretty and' the
waist will button frankly by means of
buttons and buttonholes and not by
the little Invisible, loops and thÂ» eva
sive hooks which were such a trouble
last season.
There Is a French shirt waist which
buttons Invisibly front, and back. The
method is by means of the under arm
seam and the shoulder seam. It Is not
a difficult thing to manage. And there
Is another French waist which does
not button at all, neither does It hook,
nor is It caught together with pins.
This mysterious waist, which neither
buttons nor hooks, Is made of Â¦ lace.
The entrance is through the back. The
panels of lace are then brought to
gether and an obliging friend sews the
waist in place. It Is etltched together
with long white thread stitches which
shut It and keep It In shape.

Naturally this furnishing calls for

If It Is possible always have hard
wood floors with, a large rug lxÂ» tne.

clean and looks better than a straight,
trim carpet. A new wrinkle these days
Is tha using of linoleum instead of tha
wood, and as It comes In exact Imita
tion of the Inlaid work it answers the
purpose very nicely, especially in sum
mer, as the^-ug may be dispensed with
entirely and the room is cooler and Is
wonderfully attractive as" well.
And another little Innovation for hot
weather Is the use of candles for light
ing the dinner table instead of gas or
electricity. Of course the candles would
not give sufficient light, but when they
are supplemented by half a dozen huge
Russian or Japanese candelabra of sil
ver or brass the soft glow is very
grateful. The quaint old Venetian
lamps with the points are pretty when
suspended from the celling by a heavy
brass chain, and the round candles that
were used as altar lights in the flowery
temples are more than decorative, as
they stand anywhere from four to five
feet high and are usually solid brass.
A blue dining-room rarely, fails to
be charming, for it is pleasing at all
times, and a red room Is anything but
matter what the money value may be.
A marble or crystal vase filled with a

Now and again you see a piano In &

Bedrooms should be dainty and sweet

woods that are being used at all la
sets â blrdseye maple, goldaa oak, curly,

for a dull pink, the lighter tones for

striped with â¢ the prevailing color. Is
beautiful and a dotted swlss edged with
a valance of lacs Is quite as effective.
A pretty idea for a boudoir. Is the use

mmSSSmimmBu as she gave him the
coveted dime.
She smiled whimsically as she took
her seat in the crowded car. She held
the daisies a moment against the crim
son roses on her breast, then reread
Walter Antler's note:
"Margaret/Dear: It's hard lines that
I can't see you off, but Harding's out

shall be up soon for my answer. Good

â¢ "WALTER.".
She leaned her fair face to the roses
and breathed deeply. It was so sweet
to know that she was all-in-all to the
winning, successful ' man. Her eyes
fell to the daisies, and with a sudden
suffocation she opened the window. .
"Is^ It too much' air for you?" she
asked courteously of the plain middle
aged woman beside her. 'â'.'Â¦
The woman laughed pleasantly.
"There can't be. too much air for me.
I've been to the city for two weeks ah*
I'm downright hungry for a whiff of
fresh air. I had a good time, -I guess;
leastways I did what folks there call
havin' a good time.. But Fve had all
I ever want. Mercervllle's good enough
for me after this."
The girl's face grew serious. It was
the charm of the' city that had taken
her away from her father and her
motherâ and Jack. For two years the
city had held her. and till Just the
month before she had thought she
loved it too well to leave for even a few
weeks' vacation. Then had come a
longing, a desperate heart sickness for
green fields, peaceful nights .arid the
fragrant, cooling of the hills. She
would fjrow tire'd of them in a few
weeks she thought wearily. She would
long then Just as earnestly for the
brllllantl j lighted â¢ restaurants, " the
Hungarian music, the sparkle and .life
of the gay crowds about her. She
would want the theaters, the concerts,
the streets' pulsing with, humanity.

ly built, unconscious of himselfâ his
pleasant face reflected his clean, hon
est life, and his easy-going gait and
ready-made clothes spoke the custom of
the town. She looked at him tran
quilly. No, it was not Jack that had
drawn her here. It was her father or
her mother. How sweet to have mother
tuck her In bed, and to feel the soft
kiss on her cheek after the heart-hun
gry mother thought her little ewe lamb
fast asleep. How good, too, to hear
father call her "Daisy" and ''Girlie"
once more.
And she was glad to see Jack. He
came next evening and told her in his
soft, slow voice all the news of tha
place, and â once more â how dearly he
loved her. -) ..
"D"o you, Jack," she asked wistfully.
"Could I mean more to you. than this!"
She reached out her arms caressingly
toward the stretch of green and dewy
fragrant flowers lying so peacefully be
neath the soft moonlight. "Could you
be happy with me on a hot, paved
street, with no trees nor " fields of
flowers, and where the air was â sick?"
She laughed tremulously. "You can't
understand, of course, butâ I came
home Just for the smell of the grass,
the stillness, the pure, sweet air!"
His big warm hand clasped her cold
little fingers lovingly*.
"I do understand," he said, gently.
"I went to the city once, was there al
most a year, but I had to come back.
I was doing well, too. I never told you
about It â it seemed rather womanish
for a big hulking man to hanker for
green fields -and flowers."
She moved nearer to hfm.
"There's a man there," she said, soft
ly, "thatâ thatâ I think Iâ love. He
made it very pleasant for me, and he's
clever and well-to-do. I thought a few
weeks here would satisfy me. but I
know now it won't." I must have the
great, big openâ I can't be shut in.
Shall I write him 'Nor" Almost to
herself she breathed the question agi
tatedly under her breath.
"Not if you truly love him, Daisy.*'
he said generously. "But I do want
you, dear, andâ I'd like my chance
along with his. Give me two weeks,
then send for him and talk things over
and decide."
The two weeks were blissful ones for
both, but Margaret could not determine
how great a share of the Joygivlng was
Jack's! They trudged contentedly
along the dusty roads together, picked

Bob, in a relieved tone, "she would for

Late that afternoon Bob came hur
rying into his office, with apologies
and protestations of regret.
"I had no chance to send a line to
elther v you or Grace," . he said, "and
somehow, old fellow, you've made a
good Impression on - her-^-she really
wants to meet you."
"Never mind, Bob," answered Ste
venson, kindly, "I leave to-morrow for
a three months* trip abroad. It will
do just as well when I return." " ;
He took the plunge like a hero. Not
the slightest trace of the timidity that
had given him the title of "Bashful
Billy" among his college mates.
The girl caught her breath, but' an
swered demurely, . "I read all manu
scripts that are sent to me."
"Yes, I know* but these will not be
offered for publication, and I want
something more than a printed slip in
reply."
; "And Bob calls this man bashful,"
thought the girl, but she only said, "I
will consider the matter."
There was time for little else; the
train came to a standstill, and Miss
Murdock hurried away. Still Billy felt
that he had made good progressâ for a
bashful man. ,' V-v
"You are very kind, indeed," irrele
vantly. "I particularly wanted to meet
you to-day, for I am going away to
morrow, and I want permission to write
to you."
he wrote on the card, "Our friend.
Bob, promised to introduce â¢ me this
morning. In his absence may I not
come and spepk with you?"
A half dollar and a whispered in
struction to the train boy and the thing
was done. Billy suffered' agonies in a
brief minuteâ his heart ) thumped
against his ribs and his number sixteen
collar seemed four sizes too small. The
girl read the pleading line, looked de
liberately down the aisle and nodded
brightly. He made his way to her side,
feeling like ; a man just rescued from
drowning.
"Isn't this a delightful morning, Mr.
Stevenson?" as if they were old
friends. i/J-'S.
"I love, him better for all time." she
said softly. "He and I can be friends

said, a strange lump in -his throat, as
Jack drove away. "Youâ you loveâ
him!"
"Yes." she answered gently. "He
loves the life I do. You and I are so
far apart on things. It's the outward
ness of each other you and I love. I
think; and with Jack it's â it's some
thing that comes from within. I
thought till you come if you would live
in the country I would rather live my
life with you than Jack, but â "
"You would notâ even then?" he
asked eagerly. She was very lovely,
and he thousht he loved her enough
for the sacrifice. She smiled in won
drous sympathy, for had she not "mea

She looked full into Jack's tanned,
earnest face, then turned slowly to An
tler's clean-cut, virile features. The
men breathed deeply. Each knew that
the woman he loved Was deciding for
or against him. Margaret herself did
not realize what she was doing. She
broke the rasping silence with a low:

were as satisfied as though he werÂ» a

Then she sent for Walter Antlsr and
waited in strange indecision tor him
to come. She wrota h*â¢ frankly of her
desire for the country, her uncertainty

about Jack.
"I don't think I understand," ha said

smiled good huxnoredly into the girl's
perturbed face. "You say If I will live
In the country you will consider my
proposal. TJ-h-m! I would losa my

and pretty, yes; but two days of it
would drive me to drink." He turned
to her earnestly. "The city will seem
different with a home of your own. and
plenty of servants and theaters and
concerts. Inside of & year you'll say
the city's the only plaee on earth to
live. Really, my darling, you can't
mean this talk about the country. It's
rank nonsense."
Billy was of many minds that day.
He half resolved to take a different
train and in some way to make the
acquaintance of the girl without Bob's
assistance. Then, remembjering the
dignity of her bearing, he shivered at
his own audacious thought. Diffi
dence was his one weakness. How he
longed to possess Bob Tennessee's
ready ease and absolute assurance.
The self-conflict ended in his taking
the- usual train, weakly â¢ relying upon
Bob's promised Introduction.
When the girl came in, looking
prettier than ever, he waited feverish
ly for Bob. A wave of indignation
swept over him when.no Bob appear
ed. His anger overcame his diffidence.
Bob had taken unfair advantage of
the situation. Even now he might be
somewhere on the train, enjoying his
friend's disappointment, and discom
fiture.. This thought spurred him on.
Taking his cardcase from' his pocket, 1
"It doesn't at all matter," indiffer
ently, " and if It did I might find some

"Oh, of course you might," retort
ed Bob wltheringly, "you might forge
a fit and fall at her feet, frothing at
the mouth! That would undoubtedly
'attract her attention/ "
But Stevenson was impregnable to
his sarcasm and Bob departed.
"Oh, don't trouble," loftily, "I may
take an earlier train to-morrow morn-
Ing."
"Thafs gratitude for you!" wailed
Bob.
"Stop writing a minute," whispered
Bob, "I want to tell you about her."
The pen went busily scratching on
and Billy made no reply.
"Her name Is Murdock â Grace
Murdock."
Mr. Stevenson is serenely uncon

Iey*s magazine," pursued Bob, "I've
known her since she was a child. At
one time I was, terribly sweet on her

"Showed her good taste," inter
posed Billy, vengefully.
" 'Let dogs delight to bark an'

that I'm a second John Rogers, I'd
never tell you that I'm to be on that

she says I may Introduce you."
"Go away," growled Billy. "I'm too
busy."

the result.
A strange group was Fathering in
her dainty dressing-room. In the midst
of its gilt and whiteness anJ laciness,
its filmy curtains ar.d tinted satin up
holsteries, stood two burly policemen,
gripping her butler. Three frightened
maids huddled in the do-irway, too
much terrified to come in and loo curi
ous to go.
"So ye found him tinkcrii:' with a
drawer, did ye. mum?" asked one of
the officers.
"I found the drawer open and he
was just patting the lace handker
chief into his pocket," replied Mrs.
Van Vorst, indicating an opÂ»n drawer
of the dresser with a sweeping, ora
torical gesture, for she haÂ«l a keen
liking for the dramatic, and this situa
tion appealed to her. She was no
coward, and there was something de
lightful in having entered he' room
to find a burglar, even though her
own familiar butler, there before her.
"I came to my room bnly a short
time ego," the went on, "and as I
entered the door I heard the sound
of a soft step. I thought that Fiflne
had come in before inc. Strangely
enough I did not even glance up at
first, but stopped there by the door
to arrange those orchids. While I

Bpoke. Imagine my start when I hVrd
a man's voice saying, 'I have stolen
your handkerchief.' I repressed a
scream and looked up to recognize in
this creature the man whom I have
lately employed as my servant."
The man stood quietly before her
while she went on with her story. The
policemen kept a wary eye upon him,
but relaxed their grip as thsy saw his
submission. ;: \i
"What came next on the prbgramme,
mum?" the officer pursued.
"I cried, "Base wretch" and seized
the whistle that summoned you. He
made no reply to me, but sat down
calmly as if waiting to be arrested."
"And faith what did he do with the
handkerchief ?" ; > '/
"He was putting it into his pocket
at the time he called my attention."
"Which one?"
"The right waistcoat pocket."
Two great hands of the law prepared
to search.
The man spoke gently. "Don't
trouble, gentlemen," he said. "I can
get it for you easier." One of hia
hands was freed and he produced an
exquisite handkerchief of cobweb
like lace. "And there's another thing
I want to do." He started to reach
for a hip pocket when a rough hand
stopped his.
"None o' that," snarled the officer..
Page dodged the questions good
temperedly. An hour later found him
housed in the station.
It was an astonishment to every
one who knew him when it was told
"Then I'll thank you to reach" In that,
pocket for me, sir."
The policeman did so. There was
no revolver in it. He gave a jrxunt
of chagrin.
"It's the money I'd like to have you
get out, sir. I ain't armed. Please
give Mrs. Van Vorst $5. That'll pay
for the little perfumery bottle I Just
broke while I was gettin' the handker
chief."
Mrs. Van Vorst stared in astonish
ment. Page was very unlike the bur
glars of storied fair.e. You do not look
for courtesy from the man who robs
you, and she felt for the first time in
her life ill at ease. She was supposed
to be mistress of any situation; her
own butler, a common thief, \ras oaf
fling: her.
The policeman took five Jingling dol
lars from the man's pocket and laid
them on the table.
"Sure and it's a polite burglar he is,
mum," said he. "The Judge'll give, him
a chance to show his manners at an
early date, WeTl trouble ye no more
now, mum. Good avenin' to ye."
As the officers marched their victim
from the room he turned and spoke to
Mrs. Van Vorst.
"I beg your pardon, ma am, for the
trouble and scare I've given you, and
I'm much obliged to you for fixin' it all
up for me so easy."
Leaving her to ponder this puzzling
remark he disappeared with the offi
cers.
From the light and warmth of the
luxurious house the three hurried into
tte bleak rain without. The patrol
wagon backed up to the sidewalk, its
step conveniently ready for the guest.
The horses fidgeted impatiently. The
restless driver clanged his gong.
"Hustle up there, .your Politeness."
growled one of the officers. '.v y
As the man started to enter the wag
on he was met by Costello, a policenvin
who had been waiting on the wagon.
"The dlvvil and all!" cried Costello.
"Sure and it's Bill Paige 1 ."
"It's me all right," answered the man
with a friendly smile and entered the
Â¦wagon. -:v;-
Costello followed to act Â£s guard, the
gong clanged, the horses started off
with a dash and the assembled small
boys scattered, their show being over.
* "Faith and I'd like to know what

said Costello after the story had been
told. "Bill Page nivver saw the in

Joy and sorrow mingled In her face.
"Oh. Bill, you're back after you swore
to me you'd- never drink again." she
cried.
"I haven't touched a drop, Polly."
he answered, and his words rang true.
"It was for stealln'," he cried Joyfully.
"Stealing!" she gasped In horror.

Presently he bethought him to visit

But, ; ph, miracle!. From "the ashes of

Malda .and ; Jack iwere -j forgotten as
swarms of soldiers manned new forts
or thronged to wild attack.

goln' to die?"
"Yes." The blue lips scarcely shaped
the word, but he caught it. It dis
tressed him greatly by virtue of knowl
edge newly learned from the resource
ful Nora, who had been trying to
frighten the child with stories of
death's grim paraphernalia. He
seized her shoulder in his baby hands
and tried to shake her. ?.-. j
"Don't die!" he cried, piercingly.
"You said Jack was comln' home to
marwy you! How can he marwy you
if you is dead? Do you flnk he would
dig you up?"
"Oh, Hammish," said the girl very
faintly, "please go away! It will be
long, so long before he comesâ I can
not live till then. And they told me
there was no more work after this.
When Jack comes tell him I wasn't
afraid ofâ the grave. It must be
warmer down there."
Conscious that he waa growing very
cold himself. Hammish. fired with a
sudden resolve, j made for . the* battered
coal scuttle. He would make a fire
himself.
For if Jack came home and had to
dig Maida up might he not hold him
(Hammlsh) responsible? How often
Maida had told him proudly of her
big, warm-hearted sailor who * was
coming across the great seas!
"And I was in, no such place as this
when he knew me and courted me."
she would say more proudly still.
"Mammy and I had a little house of
our own." Then with a droop of her
tired lids. "But "when she died, after
being sick so long, it was hard, so hard
to make bread. You don't know how
hard, little Hammlsh, but it will be
your turn tome day."
Â¦ "Don't care!" Hammish was wont to
Maida must gro hungry. If, he j did
these, two, deeds he" would .lose' his
playthings and his supper.
The. girl on the bed took no heed
of passlngtime. She was in the last
sleep before death, which the frost
king fills with exquisite mirage. . - :
Then something troubled her. A
voice was calling, Â¦Â¦ calling, insistently,
angrily, and with the voice floated a
smell of. something, burning. .Then a
shrill; wall made her open her;eyes
in earnest. She : sat up- to discover
Hammish dancing frantically > around
a fire of blocks in the grate, on which
boiled a tin. cup of milk,' now. running
over the edge. .
- "bweadful - smell, Isn't it?" he
shrieked excitedly. "Come quick!
Hurry!" ..,,..
She stumbled out somehow. ' Thjs
child must be attended to,' and pres
ently found herself swallowing* the' hot
milk ' H.ammish manfully forced on
her.' It brought new life to" her veins,
and she understood the miracle of the
fire and food;
"Oh, you darling," she wept, clasp

; Â¦ ; Â¦' Hammish tore himself loose. . I
"You are cwyirig all over me,',' he
said with masculine disapproval. "Was

Ai they crouched together,, by the
fire they 'did not, hear a knock at the
door until it was. twice repeated. ; *
. Then it was Hammish who shouted

apartV as, though the deck, heaved' un
der him, â¢ and shouted triumphantly r
. : "He's done comeâ an' you ( won't have

Now indeed the puzzled knight er
rant faced a complex situation., His
mother, the deus ex machlna, who al
ways remedied all wrongs, would not
return until sunset. How, long did it
take people to die? Would Maida
really die before his mother's return- â
Just because she was cold? Of whom
could he take counsel? He knew no
one but his enemy, Nora.
He waylaid her in the corridor.
"Oh, wait!" he cried. "Please wait!
How long does it take people . to
freeze ?"
"No time at all," said Nora scorn
fully, "ye little fool ye!"
"And then- â -?"
"Then they dig a cellar of a hole an*
slap 'em into it!"
She whisked on down the corridor,
and Hammish went wearily to his own
quarters and stood before! the fire
thinking.
. For; he was now facing, the great
problem of self-sacrifice which all of
us meet sooner, or later. Either he

reiterate scornfully. "Will take my
turn all right. Shall be a man."
But now he felt vaguely that a man's
responsibility rested on him long ere
he had looked for it. For the battered
scuttle was utterly empty. There was
nothing in the pitifully bare room out
of which the tiniest fire could be "made.
In his search he lifted the faded.cur
tain which covered the box termed a
pantry. Not a fragment of food was
within. It dawned on Hammlsh that
if there was no food as well as no
coal .Malda might be hungry. Again
he attacked her imperatively, j
"Has you eat your dinner?"
MIDWINTER KNIGHT ERRANT
"Are you hungry?" he asked.
"Starved! Oh. you blessed boy, you'
were taking home groceries," and she
held up a box of biscuits.
He thrilled at the sound of her old
name for him. How often she had

days before she had become anbitious

"It's so nice to see you, Myra," he

fields, broken here
and there by black clumps of trees.
Dick Harwood bent his head to the
wind and spoke softly to his horses.
They were floundering sturdily through
the snow, eager for the end of the
jcrurney and for the comfort of the
warm barn and well-filled mangers.
"Who-oo-oo-oo-pee!"
Dick lifted his head and looked out
over the storm-swept night. That was
Myra's cry. the one he hid taught her
when he was In short trousers and she
wore long braids.
"Who-oo-oo-oo-pee!" again came the
cry, but Myra was miles away in the
bis city. It came from the little school
house at the crossroads, which waa
half covered with drifting snow. Dick
urged his horses nearer and discerned
In the doorway a dark figure, then he
caught the sound of a voice.
"Please, whoever you are, won't you
stop?"
"Myra!" he cried and flung the
reins down and ran to her.
"Why, Dick Harwood." She held out
both her hands, and then, while he
held them in his warm clasp, she
broke down and explained with little
sobbing gasps:
"I started from the station before
the storm â I thought I could get
home, you know, and then It started
âand at last I took shelter in here,
hoping that some one would pass and
give me a rids, and you are the first
person who has come â and I am near
ly frozen â nearly frozen. Dick."
"Wasn't there any wood in the
stove?" asked Dick practically.
"Yes, but I hadn't any matches,
and here l.have been for hours with
wood and stove and no fire."
Dick flung the door open and went
into the schoolroom. The rows of
battered little desks confronted him
spectrally as he lighted a match and
touched It to the ready laid fuel. The
flames leaped up and at once began
to Â£lve out. comfort.
"Now you get warm while I go and
look after the horses," said Dick.
"There is a shed back of the house
and I can cover the team with the old
robes and give them a feed of corn.
I'll be back in a minute."
When he returned he found that she
had drawn an old settle before the
fire. She sat in one corner of It with
her face pink in the reflected glow.
Dick noticed the whiteness of- the
hands that she held in front of the
blaze and the gleam of gold in the
hair that rippled under the modish
turban.
He brought In several packages and
laid them beside her.
"Oh, you blessed boy." she said, "it
was Just because I loved the plain ways
that I came hack, and because I missed
my friends and the dear old bill* and
you, Dick."
"And how we used to slide down the
lone hill outside and how I lost my
mittens once In the snow and you
found them for me?"
"I remember the kiss that you gave
me for a reward,". said Dick.
Myra blushed. "Listen, how the
wind blows," she said Irrelevantly.
Dick got up and wenfto the door.
"It's an awful night." he said as he
came back with his coat collar pow
dered white, "but when the horses are
rested and you are thoroughly warm I
think I can get you home â it Isn't far."
He knelt in front of the stove and
poked in more wood. Myra sat with
her chin In her hand, as she leaned
her elbow on her knee and gazed
dreamily into the fire.
. "It's good to be at home." she said.
Something in her tone gave him cour
age.
"I wish home might always be where
our two hearts were, Myra," he said
with unconscious poetry.
"I think that is the only home in
which I shall ever be happy. Dick."
she said simply.
"Do you mean Jt. Myra? My ways
are such plain ways, dear."
She sighed happily as he drew her
to him. , Â«:;--,Â».- ,- - - .
"I remember you with tte firelight
on your face, and with your cheeks red
i they are now," said Dick ardently.
He shook his head.
"Well," she said, "you are in no con
dition to appreciate Aunt Prlscilla's
pie. I am the only one who will do ita
deliclousness Justice." "
It was not a bad supper, that Im
promptu one served by candlelight in
the old schoolhouse. and '. -Â»ick felt him
self in a blissful dream as he looked
across the table at the fair face.
After the meal Myra fell into a re
trospective mood.
"Do you remember the -inter after
noons right here In this old room,
when we children used .j pop corn and
roast apples, and Miss Petsey would
read to us â dear Miss Betsey?"
Myra danced around the table and
clapped her hands like the little girl
Dick remembered so welL Finally she
stopped in front of him. "Dick," she
said, "did you ever eat a boarding
house pie?"
'Aunt Priacilla sent it to mother,"
he said, "but I guess we need It the
most.
"Oh. it's so cold. Every one thinks
of himself. Why, Dick, I might live
and die with twenty people in the gams
house and not one of them would
know It until the undertaker came.
That is the trouble â no one cares, no
one cares," she declared passionately.
He leaned forward eagerly, then
checked himself. "But you have your
music?"
"Oh. music." she said disparagingly,
and at her tone his heart leaped.
The water had boiled in the little ket
tle. . .- -
"L "will let you make the tea," he
said, and opened the package, of the
fragrant herb. While she heated the
teapot and put the tea to steep he drew
a little table in front of the settle and
put on it crackers and cheese and sar
dines; then with a laugh and a flourish
he set in the center a great, creamy,
custard pie.

tle. "I was Just dying to see you â
all â " she added the last word quickly
as Dick whirled around and looked at
her with hia soul In his eyes. She did
not meet his look, however, and ha
turned away with a little sigh. "Do
you like it in town?" he asked.
"Um-um," she murmured.
"Does that mean 'yes* or 'no'?" He
had brought out a little kettle and a
teapot and was filling the kettle with
water from a covered pall that stood
behind the stove.
"Both." she laughed, "I like it and I
don't like it."
"What don't you like?" he asked.

"Maybe I be," returned the other
quietly. "T reckon you've the tight to

He s>ut a foot on the log and looked
down at the moon-flecked river.
"You see, I love her," said he simply,
"and so I've got to know. I've been

"I'm not responsible for the talk If

more than I would with any pretty girl

"No, I reckon not. It's something
hyer I want you to do. It's to answer
a cuestion. What are you goin' to do
about Glory?"
"About Glory? What should I do

"You know right well what I mean.

"And may I ask, Mr. Hackett. in my

here, on which Coventry seated himself.
"Fire away," he said, lighting a cigar.
He offered one to his companion, but it
was declined.
The man hesitated for a moment bs
if he found it hard to commence.
"My name is Hackett," he said grave
ly. "Mort Hackett. Maybe you've
heard it?"
Coventry bowed courteously.
"I hear tell," Mort cc-ntlnued, "that
you're Mowing to so back East to-mor

"Yes," answered Coventry. "Want

Glory never had enjoyed any dance

frankly, and her eyes more than said

It was all rather interesting, Coven

when his partner was dancing with

was rather glad he was going to leave
the next day. He had not told Glory
he was going. There was no need
of epolllng her fun. It was best for her
that he went. Perhaps he had paid her
too much attention; she did not realize
the Â»g"ulf between them, and, besides,
she had been rather too demonstrative
this night. That was one of the diffi
culties of an affair with a woman of
such a simple, unsophisticated nature.

"Are you crazy?" Coventry cried.
"You made her love you, well now

"But if I won't?"
"Then I'm goln* to kill you."
He said It quite calmly, and before
Coventry realized the words he saw
the moonlight glinting along the barrel

"Do you suppose I care for him?" she

"SUPPOSE"
Ingersoll held the stage longer than
any of his compeers, because he left
the beaten path and discussed the prob
lem of the ages fearlessly and elo
quently from his own' point of view.
He was notâ as has j sometimes been
said â "an infidel for revenue only." He
was an honest apostle of the gospel of
annihilation. He believed in eternal
death as sincerely as Calvin believed
In eternal damnation, and lie roasted
orthodoxy in speech as relentlessly as
Calvin roasted Servetus at the stake.
Ingersoll believed that the dying in
fant passed on foreverâ never to live
again, save in the grasses and the flow
ers. Calvin believed that God snatched
the smiling child from its mother's
arms only to hurl its predestined baby
soul into an abyss of unending torture.
Ingersoll denied the existence of a
personal god, or of" a prearranged fate
for man. Calvin asserted that, there
was an individual creator, whose de
light was to call into existence millions
of souls, whom . in the hour cf their
birth he foredoomed to eternal flames.
Both Calvin and Ingersoll were honest
in their beliefs and both were wrong.
Calvinism has not helped Christian
ity. Our human sense of Justice is
shocked by the doctrine of salvation by
selection of a few and eternal torture
of the many.
Whatever the reason may be the fact
is patent that the voices which of old
could stir the blood of listeners as with
the blare of trumpets and tingle their
eyelids to tears have gone into the
great silence, and their successors come
not, for commercialism has discouraged
the orator and driven him from the
path along which, high ambition once
pointed the way to fame.

Unless conditions are similar and Im
mutable it cannot be certainly said
how far any existence may remember
its previous existence, and the law of
evolution is the law of change. No
message has ever been brought from
the realms of ether saying that our
diviner selves leave their memories at
the portals of the tomb, and it may well
be claimed that man is that link in
the chain of existence where the ex
periences of the previous life pass the
, ordeal of physical dissolution and ac
companies the new life Into Its now con
ditions; that man Is that link in the
chain of existences where the mental
life, the spiritual life, the conscious
ness of existence leaves its envelopment,
its body, Its late habitation to dissolve
into gases the while it sails i wander

Surely there is no conflict between
science and religion with respect to the

fits the other closely and harmoniously
and It really requires less credulity to
believe that we shall live consciously

consciously heretofore.

who seeks for his gospel In. the puerili

over the keys of the.piano and at the
sound the violinists adjusted their in

men at the bass viol, 'cello and flute
stood at attention and in another mo

It seemed to roll through the place in
waves, the thin edges of which went
curling through the open doors and out
into the darkness of the street, where
the passers-by slackened their steps to
listen. The half dozen persons who sat.
in the balcony listening succumbed
even more completely to its charm".
"Lovers â lovers everywhere!" mur
mured Agnes Jennings mirthfully, as
her gaze wandered idly over the scene*
before her. Her companion's answering
smile was somewhat abstracted. While
she 'had been watching the others he
had been watching her. It was a habit
he had acquired, and it was particular
ly in moments like this, when her head
was thrown back against the chair, her
eyes were touched with dreaminess and
the shadowy smile was quivering on
her lips.
. There were, indeed, two absorbed
couples near them, and Richardson
obediently pretended to be interested in
them. Of the older pair, the man was
of the stout, flushed, prosperous type
so common in our cities. ; "I'm as good
as you are" was written \ in every line
of his face.
But as he gazed at the woman beside
him, who was oppressively pink of
cheek, bright of eye and black of hairâ
you saw that" he made one exception.
For the moment he was an idealist
and she was his ideal! In some clumsy,
speechless way he 'showed that he felt
that he wasn't so good as sheâ that he
aspiredâ that he loved!
"He has forgotten that he's the suc
cessful Tim O'Donohue," remarked
Richardson laughingly. "He has for
gotten how he started with a pick-ax
and spade and now wears a diamond in
his shirt frontâ he has forgotten every
thing but her." y
He finished the sentence as if he were
speaking to himself, and his compan
ion paid him the tribute of a lingering
glance in which | a question mark was
barely perceptible. Then she returned
to her derisive contemplation of the
lovers once more.
"They certainly are naive," was her
next ; comment, as with â¢ droll smile
she watched the other coupleâ a slen
der girl with sweet blue eyes and a
lordly youth with a reassuring breadth
of shoulder and crisp dark hair. The
blue eyes were gazing 'up at him as if
he were a godling, as in fact he looked:
"The cunning /-.Ings!" ejaculated
Miss Jennings Â¦ softly, as the youth's
hand gently touched the girl's as it lay
on the arm of the chair.- "S-h-h,*, don't
move!" she cautioned, as Richardson
shifted his position' to get Â« a' t better
glance of them.' "You'ir attract' their
attention, and then they' will 1 sit' up

ment of this bewitching music, could
you sit and listen unmoved? Wouldn't
there be some change in your expres
sion â and In mine â by which a curious
person who was looking on might dis
cover what all the world loves? Andâ
would we care very much?"
He was leaning forward, his â¢ strong,
muscular hands clasped loosely before
him, a whimsical smile on his lips.
"With a thrill of triumph he saw that
she was not listening unmo'ved even to
the supposition.' .But she kept a bold
front."
"Do I seem to be melting?" she in
quired with a touch of defiance which
comported ill 'with the tumultuous
beating/of her heart and a most an
noying feeling of tremulousness about
the lips. It was too absurd. . But at
least he should not know how embar
rassed she was.
Then-he proceeded calmly with his
odious suppositions. '
"But that was not all. Suppose that
I should tell you that though I love
you as . a - man" can love but once,
though you are to me the scent of the
roses, the sweetness of music, the dear
est Joy of life, I am honor bound to
another. Would there be anything to
show that you cared?"
Slowly the color faded from her face.
She realized it, but she could not help
it, for she felt still and cold and mo
tionless. Then, almost piteously, her
eyes sought his. Triumph and glad
ness were visible there. His look was
a caress. The placeâ the musicâ the
people momentarily vanished from her
consciousness. She felt as if they were
alone In the worldâ a fuller, happier
world than she had even before
dreamed of.
His ; low, pleased, tantalizing laugh
recalled her. Her cheeks went scar
let arid her eyes blazed.
"Agnes ! Agnes ! " he admonished, us
ing her first name without a sign of
apology, precisely as if he intended
using it always fn the future. "Beware,
my dear girl. If those others," nod
ding toward the couples whom she had
so lately criticized, "were less absorbed
in their own affairs I 'am afraid they
would be 'justified', In thinking that we
are having a lovers' quarrel:"
"You wretch." she said at; last. It
really seemed the only thing to doâ to
smile and make the best of it. Then
her glance strayed to' the others/ It
was a trifle more sympathetic than be
fore. O'Donohue, as they had named
him, sat silent, uncomfortableâ happy.
The godling and the blue-eyed girl were
talking, but were perhaps saying more
with their eyes than with their lips.
"Might I have the honor of your at
tention?" pleaded Richardson's voice
meekly. â¢ . .
She turned toward hlrnJi trying hard
to look serious, but the corners of her
. mouth wavered. Â£
"Suppose," the voice was a bit breath
less, "suppose I were to tell you that
the first part was true â terribly trueâ
the part about my caring' for you?" he
questioned. "TJie rest, of course, was
nonsense."
Little waves of, color swept over her
face and disappeared in the duskiness
of her hair. s She gave him one quick
glance , and -* her lids '! covered . her eyes
and shut out their message. .'
In the convenient shadow of the chair
his " big brown , hand 'closed over hers
with a touchâ gentle, firm, supreme.
Â¦ ;Â¦"â¢" There werethree pairs of loversâ but
alas ! no audjence. . ;
Apparently they -were oblivious to the
people "about them as well *' as to the
laughing scrutiny turned upon them, as
they sat gazing blissfully into each oth
er's eyes. .
"Now, what do you suppose they see
there?" drawled Richardson, going
back to his interrupted contemplation
of Agnes' profile. She laughed lightly.
"Everything floating in a rose colored
mist. Nothing: but joy, joy, Joy! In
visible music â and always 'themselves
together, and happy," she hazarded.
"It's a bit cruel to think how different
ltwillreally be, isn't it?"
As she turned toward him with a look
grown pensive Richardson was filled
with a sudden optimism.
â¢'it'- may come true. You can't tell!"
â¢There was something vaguely sug
gestive in his tone, and Miss Jennings
looked "again. She was half inclined to
believe â but no! s
The music stopped. The youth's dark
head was hent toward the girl, and he
was murmuring to her in - low, muffled
tones. The man whos- appearance
suggested contracts shrewdlr and prof
itably carried through was making a
palpable effort to say something that
.was determined not to be said. He
shifted in his chair, and the red of his
face grew darker, while his companion
chatted composedly â too composedly,
Richardson thought, as his speculative
glance came home to^the lady at his
side. " '. "\ Â¦-.Â¦; : "Â¦"-"; â¢->Â¦Â¦-Â¦
"Isn't it odd?" said she, breaking the
silence, "that they are so unconscious?
They don't seem to notice usâ to think
tha,t perhaps we are watching them.
Fancy forgetting everything like that!"
Her listener's eyes seemed to be re
duced to mere points. He felt ' oddly,
nettled at her words, and as quick as a
flash decided to make an experiment.
Was she really so cold and impersonal
as she seemed? Â¦ Well, ''it " was decreed
that he should find out some time, and
this was perhaps as good a time; as
any. * . : ' ; .
"My .dear girl," he began in a fath
erly tone, "It Is only in the shallowBi
that one thinks of the opinion of the
public. Don't you know that In the
real, moments of- lifeâ the moments
that mean somethingâ one cares as lit
tle about the public as about the leaves
onthetrees? 'Don't you know that it
must be so?"
She opened her lips to -protest, but
he gave her no chance; to speak.
"Now put yourself in the place of
these people here. Suppose," he man
aged to fling a word of teasing sar
casm into his words, "suppose, for in

tell you that I love you; that I've loved
you since the day we met for the first
time;, that I cannot and will not live
without ; you; thatââ"
He stopped abruptly in order to take
a fresh ; i start. Somethingâ urgent,
earnest, appealingâ had crowded the
mockery out of his voice. It had the
ring ; of appeal. It sounded far too
much In earnest. He called the mock

As with us, those who had died in

welcome, and, I hope, well used for the
benefit of those who were dear to the
fallen, whose lot Is, I doubt not. deso
late, too, as- in other lands ' when the
first fever of popular appreciation is
over.
At the temple only the families of
those who had fallen in battle were ad
mitted to the shrine, but these luckless
honored ones were surrounded by
flocks of obsequious priests wearing
their beautiful robes of; oranire yellow
silk, and their quaint old-fashioned
Korean hats. And so it. went on from
early morning until late at night. Com
pany after*company of troops, of horse,
foot and artillery, came iweeoinK by
the Kudan Hill and then were marched,
up In fours to salute the sacred shrine
devoted to the ashes and the souls of
the war herops. ',
Outside there was fencing in the bid
style, and story-tellers telllnts old tales
of- old Japan to strengthen men's souls.
The ' Emperor had been the very first
to visit the shrine to the fallen brave.
butÂ»by a very remarkable instance of
tact on the part of thousands and hun
dreds of thousands of .people, they had
all absented themselves at. the hour oi

and room enough for the Emperor to
say his prayers and hurry off without
incurring the danger of any one look
lac down on him.

Then the spirit of the Sacred Samu
rai, which .is that of patriotic self-sac
rifice, spoke in the breast of a young
ensign of the fleet. He announced that
he had invented a new. attachment
which would hold i, the; explosive in
place,' and all ' he asked of the admiral
was permission to go in the following
evening and all would be well. This
permission: and a picked crew - were
given and not a word was breathed in
regard to the "new. attachment" until
in the dark of. ; the wintry night .the
overhanging shadow of j the v boom was
seen. Then the little ensign had his
say* to the^warrant â¢ officers who. sur
rounded him and had been instructed
to obey his; orders implicitly. â¢ Â¦
j "No mechanical^ contrivance was re

end of tbe boom with hia bomb in his
hand. < A few moments and the terrific
explosion . took \ place, which rent the
boom asunder and opened the entrance
to ; the beleaguered harbor. The ( next
day, when Wel-Hai-Wel: capitulated the
same honors which': were paid to Â¦ tbe
rebellion, were duly honored, ana now
in their hour of triumph came the
heroes of the 1 war with China.
The hilltop was . crowned by the
largest banner of Japan I have ever
seen; it was as large as the mainsail
of the : largest schooner, and fortu
nately, there was enough wind to keep
it right nobly floating on the breeze.
Trailing in the dust before this mam
moth standard lay the dingy little bat
tleflaga of the Chinese, and all about
were piled up the weapons of the con
quered, the spoils of successful battle.
What curious booty it" was! There
were the lances of Manchurian cav

Gatling guns, with a fringe of bows
and arrows "to complete the Incon
gruity of 'the scene. â¢
v On an esplanade, under the flagstaff
hill there were rows upon rows of
booths in which were seated family
groups . of . country : folk, the honored
survivors of the fallen, who had come
Into the city to be guests of. the nation
for a few days and breathe in the
fragrance of honor and veneration
which was paid them on all-sides.
Upon the humble booths which housed
the honored , families there were lit
tle inscriptions of but a few words
each telling the deed of daring and
tho name of the man. who,, under the
sanction of tho Emperor, the Board of
Rites had decreed should be honored
here.
And all day long the thousands

chosen^ death self-inflicted, rather than

vessels awaiting this sad homecoming.

at his -heart; strings which neither
time nor honors will assuage.
â¢ The ' fete '' of. ; victory and ; thanksgiv

day. and I witnessed the ceremonies in
Tokio upon; the Kudan Hill;* which is
the Japanese -Field' of : Mars. *â¢> The
great Shinto temple there is called Yu
Kuni, : and \ was Â¦ erected 1 after and in
honor of the restoration of the Hoe of

should* know, took" place /fn 1868.

ing either the court or the classic lan
guage, and Sir Ernest Satow, the
British Minister, and one of the great
est of Japanese scholars, stood near
me and seemed to be drinking it all
in. I would later ask him to tell me
what were the words that had fallen
from the. Imperial lips.
At the conclusion of his address the
Emperor bowed, and then every one
bowed, the peers much lower than Uie
commoners; and as for Hoshi Yoru,
the great radical, since assassinated,
he hardly nodded. Then the Emper
or withdrew, and perhaps the only
survival of the East in the transplant
ed performance ;"wa.s the circumstance
that, as the members of the Cabinet
and the Privy Council followed him,
they stopped for a moment to make
low obeisance before the august and
honorable chair in wlycli the Lord of
Ten Thousand Years had sat. ;
And now, what the Emperor really
did say we never knew until the news
papers were published, which in
Japan is not immediately after the
event, because Sir Ernest, the great
Japanese scholar, admitted with evi
dent sincerity that there were so many
imperialisms and honoriiics in the Em
peror's discourse that the only word3
he seized beyond the peradventure of
a doubt was 'Â»Chosen."
"It was something about Korea;
that is all I could vouch for," was the
modest explanation of the British
Minister. And so we had to wait for
the papers, and they had to wait for
their interpreters to summon courage
to attack so august a morsel as a
speech from the throne. After all,
it was only "something about Korea."
But what it was no one 'could make
out, and this haze and vagueness is
a specialty of the situation to-day as it
was yesterday.
Out on. the review ground the Em
peror is more animated and undoubted
ly more amiable. It is certain- that he
likes his soldiers bettei 1 than he does
his politicians, especially those unruly
fellows of the lower house, who only
three weeks ago had the audacity to
pass a vote of censure upon the Im
perial Ministry â which, in view of the
fact that under the German constitu
tion .-that Marquis Ito borrowed from
Bismarck, the Ministry is the choice of
and only responsible to the Emperorâ
was a reflection upon the very throne
..jrhjch the .fathers. of.ihese darlne radi
cals would never have presumed to'ad-<
dress, much less censure. Whether for
weal or woe, it is certain that the po
litical schoolmaster is abroad in Japan,
and, that future Mikados are not likely
to be permitted to, pursue their time
honored course â : the way of the gods
and the demi-gods â without some ex
ceedingly annoying interruptions.
On the parade ground, however, the
Emperor is surrounded Uy his generals
of the Cho-Shu clan and his old-time
statesmen. Fuch as Ito and Inouye, the
great medal men, as they are called in
Japan, or the elder statesmen, who still
have great power over the Emperor's*
mind and through him over the desti
r.les of the empire, though they do not
stnnd so well with the voters as they
did. - â¢>Â»
Generally the Emperor comes to the
parade in a carnage which Is sug
gestive of Coburs, or Gotha. or any
prim little German residence city you
please, and remains in his tent when
the troops march by; but I have seen
him trallop â to be precise, amble â over
the field on a well domesticated Aus
tralian horse and also view the march
past from the saddle: but this was an
unusual treat.

By Stephen Bonsai.
THE attitude of the peace-loving
Czar, father of the Hague Tri
bunal, in the Far Eastern im
broglio has been no mystery to
those who follow world politics or
even read the papers. The vari
ous switchings which from time to
time the Czar has in the last few
months administered to the more ex
travagant members of the war party in
Russia have been given almost publicly.
Now the Emperor of Japan, the mys
terious Mikado, in dismissing with but
scant courtesy a warlike and almost
rebellious Parliament, has in his turn
given valiant testimony to his desire
lor peace. Surely, if war ensues it will
be because the people have willed it and
not because, as in the olden days, their
rulers goaded them into hostilities.
Despite the fact that the Emperor no
longer lives shrouded in the dim. re
ligious light of the Kyoto palace, and
that the Japanese believe his mode of
life to be the came as that of any other
constitutional monarch, his public ap
pearances are few and far between. He
is to be seen by the ruling classes of
the empire and the diplomatic corps
at the spring and fall cherry blossom
and chrysanthemum garden parties: at
the opening-of the Diet, and once or
twice a year when he drives out to the
Aoyama plain to review the troops. For
the rest of the time he remains seclud
ed in the precincts of the palace
grounds and buildings, which are. after
all. rpaclous enough for more rovinsr
tastes than his. The Vatican and its
gardens and the monotonous courts of
the Peking forbidden city coujd be
placed therein and there "wonld still be
room for Central Park, and aulte com
fortably, too.
The Emperor is tall for a Japanese,
about five feet seven in height, and
rather heavily built. He. looks older
than his years, which are 52. .His beard
Is long, rather than full, and he has
the same coarse black hair which all
his subjects have, and. happily for
them, rarely lose, however lone thev
may live. His eyes are coal black and
of a rare brightness when interested,
but generally 'their expression Is dull
and heavy. Some declare that the Mi
kado of the MeJJi. or "enlierhtened
peace," era is the most remarkable
man of the age, and others that he is
but little- removed from an idiot.--ThÂ«
truth. as usual, lies somewhere between
the extremes advanced. In my opinion
there are r.ot more than three or four
men living, including the Marauis Ito.
who have had the necessary inter
course with their monarch upon which
to base an estimate of his -ability and
character, and these, the "great medal"
statesmen, as i they are called, whose
intimate acquaintance dates back to the
Ftormy days of thÂ» revolution, wou'd
be very careful before they cave pub
licity to any opinoin they migrht have.
Indeed, in view of the veneration
which has been bred in their fiesh for a
thousand years. I should judge them
quite Incapable of taking the same
careful estimate of their god-descended
ruler as they would of an ordinary mor
tal.
It 5k within reason, however, .to sav
that, judged by the handicaps to which
he was born, and giving to him the
credit for the advance and development
of Japan during his reign, the present
Emperor, Mutsu-Hito, has certainly
achieved more than any other ruler of
men enthroned to-dav.

M.kado we were not admitted into the
Chamber of Peers, but were crowded
into little drawing-rooms that were not
the more cheerful from the fact that all
the curtains were nailed down. This
was done, we understood, though not
rrom an official eouree. so that no one
could, should he so far forget himÂ«elf
rive his curiosity rein and look down
from above on the august descendant of
a hundred Emperors, and perhaps a few

The only word I understood was the

nÂ°L surprise me. jny Japanese not be-
sense, and apart from the Shinto
learning and the Buddhist philosophy
which he Imbibed ait an early age, may
have been' perfected, as some say,
after heÂ»cameiof age, but walking is
evidently not one of 'the accomplish
ments which can be acquired late in
'life. - Â¦
There. is no spring to the Emperor's
step; his knees are stiff .'and the whole
exercise is awkward and evidently dis
tasteful to h!m. I have'heard some
westernized Japanese say â and I be
lieve withi truth â that the Emperor's
walk is the last reminder of the tyran T
ny of the Tycoons, which was over
thrown in 1868. ;
"It is quite common to read 'of this
or that statesman, native or. foreign,
having a tfleasant chat with the Em
peror, and these accounts give" quite a
misleading idea of what thaJc inter
views are, or were until a few months
ago. â¢-.-._
I have been present many times when
the Emperor was speaking to Field
Marshal Tamagata. the head of the
army; to Admiral Ito, the saigo of the
navy; to Marquis Ito or Count Inouye.
two men who are supposed to enjoy his
confidence in an extraordinary degree,
and I never ence saw him speak to them
directly, but always indirectly through
one ct the officials of his household.
Perhaps this hedge us not maintained
in private, but it is still very apparent
in public. No one can chat with the
Emperor; he can* only communicate
with him through the medium of a
third exalted person. , - - m
It is known that th'e Emperor is fond
of ancient Shinto books and that he is
an amateur of sword making, accord-
Ing to the old mysterious methods
which nroduced blades in comparison
with which Toledan steej.*is brittle; all
else about his tastes and occupations is
shrouded in the reserve that he still
survives in the palace. ;
I am aware, to my shame, that the
question s,till remains unanswered 'in
what light the* Japanese regard their
ruler. * It is akin to~ the respectful, al
most awe-stricken, which the Russian
has for the great white Czar, but it is
different, certainly, sui generis. I have
at various times asked, and I am afraid
importuned. Japanese of all ranks to
tell me what It is, and the best answer
I ever received was from General Fu
kushima, who knows Europe and the
western world well. . ,
"What we feej for the Emperor," he
said, "is a sentiment which only, a
Japanese can feel, and which certainly
no Japanese can explain."
I should add that he is apparently re
garded as a perfected ancestor, a -god
and a hereditary leader â a link between
this and the past generations, perhaps
between this worldl and the place of
spirits. This need fiardly add to the
confuslcn of General Fukushima's defi
nition.
I once saw the comparative methods
of American and. Japanese patriotism,
as represented by an American marine
recruit from Seattle and an engineering
student from Osaka, settled upon the
forward deck of a Pacific Mail steamer
-^-settled in a way which was very sat
isfactory to our arms. But I .confess
our . peace . festivals after the Spanish
war did not appeal to me quite as much
defend it against future enemies" were,
as I 'remember them, the words of the
Imperial, rescript. Â¦ -A curious custom I
noticedâ whlch^has recently been fol
lowed in. England, where Lqrd Roberts
has been empowered \b .wear his son's
Victoria Cross a^ well as his ownâ was
the decoration i of the fathers of thoaa
soldiers who had- distinguished them
selves by their -gAlIantry. but had not
survived the battle. '. 'Â¦â¢''<
The Emperor' with his own hand dec
orated the \ father of itte young recruit
who in a critical'moment of the attack
on Port Arthur Ihad^ made a breach in
the stubbornly defended 'gate, by means
of â¢ a dynamite.fstlck j by which- he . was*
also blown to pieces.; This -patriotic lad
was.of the coolie class arid not of thÂ»
fighting strain of the Sajnural.
. The hero of We.i-HaSWei, however,
was a 'â¢Sacred Samurai/'- as the saying
Is in- Japan, of the^nghting caste, and
the honor that, was shown to his ashes
was '.greater, though- certainly, not
greater, than he deserved./ In the mid
night attack on the then Gibraltar of
Chinese power the unenviable post of
the forlorn hope was naturally given
to the fleet of torpedo boat destroyers.
Behind a great . boom crouched the
crippled Chinese ships that had escaped
from the Yalli fight Until they were
sunk or utterly destroyed, there was no
security for the Japanese armies so far
from their base across the seas. Every
encouragement had been offered by Ad
miral Ito and the 'ranking officer toÂ»
their yung men \ to batter down the'
barrier, but without success â the
weather, a northeast storm that swept
the Gulf of Chili. :was -helping: the de
fenders ai.J the snow and Ice began at"
last to depress the spirits and the cour
age of the hardy islanders.-.
In -the teeth of . adverse -wind and
weather and under a concentrated fire
from the forts and the shipping, sev
eral torpedo boats had advanced
through the cannonade and attached
explosives to the barrier, but all to no
purpose. Whsn day came it was seen
that the bcom survived and that the
fugitive Chinese lleet was still safe
guarded from the attach of the larger

Society Permits Use of One Knife
and Fork Throughout Dinner.
LONDON. Jan. 16.â One of the
things that most surprise Americans
when they dine out in Belgian society
Is the absence of a sufficiency of
knives and forks. One knife and fork
is considered ample for each person
for the whole of the courses, and It
was indeed not. very long ago that
good Belgian society took to fish
knives. A magnificent dinner service,
intended for- a nobleman, which was
specially exhibited at one of the larg
est silversmiths In the capital the
other day, revealed the fact that
though of the most splendid silver and
boasting covers for twenty-four, there
were only twenty-four knives and
forks. True there were twenty-four
pairs of the silver knife rests on which
each diner is supposed to place his
implements between the courses, after
having carefully wiped them with
bread.
The silversmith was astonished at
the expressions of horror of the Amer
ican ladies who examined the display,
at such rough and ready manner of
living. The only explanation given
is that it saves ' service, and being a
national hablt.no one thinks it strange.
Another extraordinary with re
gard to V..2 wa'y Belgians live is that
there Is not v one single house in Bel
gium from the* place downward that
has an upstairs supply cf hot water,
nor indeed any automatic supply for
the kitchen, while Jt isfonly.the rich
who have cold water laid on above the
ground floor. At the same time the
houses are furnished handsomely and
with' considerable taste.
BELGIANS ARE ECONOMICAL.
Most of them come to Paris to finish
their education. The rudiments ' have
been acquired in England, and it is a
wish to give them cosmopolitan ideas
of life that induces their parents to
send them to thls"school. ; . ' ,
The chief end of the school is to ac
quaint them with the best side of
French life. They have lessons in
dancing, fencing, gymnastics and cook

PARIS, Jan. 16. â An English board
ing-school has Just been established in
Auteuil, the suburb of Paris most af
fected as a residence quarter by rich
English and American families.
Its aim Is to give -English "girls a
knowledge of France, its lang^age/and
art, and let them have all the freedom
they would have in a school in their
own country.
Of course, the direction of such a
school is in striking contrast with the
"penslonnats" of Paris, where the girls
are not permitted to take a step outside
the school grounds without a suspicious
duenna at their heels.
These English girl sgo in parties to
the Bois de Boulogne, which is quite
near, to bicycle or play tennis. They
are sometimes seen, too, in the heart of
Paris, In parties, seeing* the sights or
going to church.

The Gyulai family is of ancient
origin, tracing its ancestry back to
the fifteenth century. Count Stephen's
branch was ennobled in 1694, the then
head of the line being given the title
of Baron in Austria. In 1701 he was
raised to the dignity of a Count of
Transylvania.
The acquaintance thus begun rapid
ly ripened into affection. The Count's
visits became more frequent He
made the girl many and costly pres
ents and bought her fashionable cos
tumes.* and took her to theaters, con
certs and other amusements. Some
of the Count's aristocratic friends and
acquaintances looked doubtfully at his
fair companion, but the nohfteman ap
peared supremely indifferent to their
opinion. The remonstrances of his
family had no more effect upon him.
for he was deeply in love with the
Hernals shoemaker's daughter and
determined upon making her his wife.
Elizabeth's father and sistera were
entertained at the Count's house in
Vienna, and, .contrary to the sort of
thing In story,, books, were always
treated with the utmost courtesy. The
Count came frequently to the shoe
maker's quarters and his acquaintance
proved very valuable to the latter
from a business standpoint, for the
shoemaker's affairs prospered visibly.
A few days ago the Count and Eliza
beth made a short trip to the country
and upon their return the Count an
nounced their "jetrothal. Active prep
arations for the wedding have begun
and the ceremony will take place very
eoon at the Count's estate In Hungary.
Count Stephen Gyulai is 27 years old
and belongs to the military order of
German knights. His father, who died
some years ago. was a great Hunga
rian nobleman, a knight of 'honor of
the Sovereign Order of Malta. He be

On the evening of January 5 the
members of Redwood Circle held the
impressive funeral service of the order
over the remains of Julia Ann Blake,
a member who died a few days before.
The servire was at 6:30 o'clock, as the
remains were to be forwarded to Sac

morning for interment in the family

floral offerings of the circle and friends
were many and beautiful.
The reception that was tendered by
Kedwood and Haven Camps of the

that was attended by a goodly num

friends of the members of the three
bodies named. There was an interest

tal and literary numbers and address
by David Oliver Jr., editor of the Pa
cific Woodman; J. W. Mltchel of Ha-

and a very interesting address by the

"This is the best of them all," she
said at last, handing over a wide-eyed,

utilized. Flashlight photographs were
taken of the tree and the happy group
that surrounded it, and later several

their comrades with vocal and instru

it was unique, and it excited unusual

at the cleverness that "organized ao un

nora.
She got up then and went to the
dressing table, picking up the portrait
of a gentlemen who is perhaps more
like Signor Azzali than Mayor Schmitz
â but not much. This she proudly
handed to me to admire.
It was not difficult, and* I asked then:
"barytone?"
"Yes," said madame, "and sings six
ty-five roles."
"Does he sing Falstajf?" with im
mediate visions of the next Tivoli
grand opera season.
"Mf . Alberti was one of the first
Falstaffs in . Milan," his wife an
nounced.,
"Did you sing in Italy also?"
"Just in small roles," she replied,
then laughed; "but It was at La
Scala."
"I thought it was very difficult for
American girls to get a hearing there."
"Think of the chance I gave her."
Miss Russell said only, with naive
honesty; "I was studying, with the di

'Fcriunio,' a new work. Haven't you
had a singer named Collamarlni

"Have we!" I said, and proceeded to
expatiate on the amount of Collama
rlni we have had.
"She appeared ia 'Fortunio.' too.
Miss Russell tranquilly recalled. "A
small part like mine and she was
only just beginning then." >Â¦
"How*long ago was that?"
"Er â eight years ago," Â¦ stammered
Miss Russell. But she corrected her
self heartily: "Perhaps a little longer.
maybe nine." I breathed again. She
was too good to spoil."
"How was Collamarinl's voice?"
"Quite small, but very sweet In qual
ity. She had studied only about six
months then."
"How did she look?"
. "She was very, very pretty." Miss
Russell said heartily.
"Collamarini is a great favorite here.
She was at the Tivoli for two seasons,"
I informed in turn.
"I am very much interested in the
Tivoli." Miss Russell said then. "Just
wait until you hear Vigna this yearâ"
"I don't undqfstandâ "
. "He Is one of Herr Conried'3 new
conductors." ,
"Eut wo shall not have the Metro
politan people out here."
"I thought," and Miss Russell's
chf ?rful mouth actually went down at
the corners, "I thought they came every
year to the Tivoli."
"No, no. They came for two seasons
t**"o or three years ago."
**I told you so, Helen,". Mrs. Pickering
said.
"Then you won't hear Caruso!"
"I'm sorry not to. Is he very
pood?"
Both women clasped their hands and
looked ecstatic volumes. Miss Russell
said:
"Caruso is the greatest tenor of the
age â pure bel canto. You should have
heard the Tosca!'.!' Caruso was, of
course, CavaradossI, Ternina La Tosca
and Scotti the Scarpla. Scotti's a great
Scarpia. Couldn't be better. I'm going
to sing 'La Tosca* _ some day," she
said, and then for all her softness there
is a little grip of the Russell lip that
means things.
"Do you like the newer Italian op-,
eras?"
"Don't like them so well as the old
ones â that is, they don't give the singer
th? same chance. If you can act bet
ter than you can sin?.* then it is wise
to take the new operas."
â¢ "What do you like, be'st to sing?"
"Leonora. Marguerite and Micaela
I have sung most. Gioconda and Alda
I have studied," sh.3 replied, and got
up to put a sheaf of press extracts into
my hands as to the doings of one Mme.
Helene Noldi.
"You? Then your name is not 'Rus-
Ee'l?'"
- "Nor 'Noldi,' either," she laughed.
" iRusseir was Mr. Friedlander'a
idea." '
"You sang as Noldi with Scalchi?"
"And with Mr. Alberti and with Ros?
Cecilia Shay. I have sung two seasons
with her."
"Oh, that's the rich young woman
who plays at baing an opera singer?"
"She's a good Carmen, and good Azu
cena," Miss Russell defended.
"We were all about Vancouver. Seat
tle and the north for eight months.
.Quite a successful season."
I stopped to admire the flowers of
the night before that were spilling a
sort of tired perfume into the room and
adorning the washbowl, the table, the
piano, the dressing table, everywhere.
Then Miss Russell, recalled to Fischer's
and her dutyâ that my painless inter
viewing had made her forget, said
shyly: "Mr. Frledlander told me to tell
you about my family."
"Your family?" I said. "Oh, I see-
Crusaders or Mayflower?" getting out
my pencil.
"Isn't it silly?" ehe laughed then and
I could have forgiven her even to Wil
liam the Conqueror. I, too, could, but
alas, no one asks to "interview me!
"Good blood is better than none," I
say solemnly.
She nods a "Yes," and then said:
"It's Commodore Perry, andâ I AM
proud of It!"

his ludicrous and appalling Incapacity

most pitiable figure of the poor fiva
that play out the pitiable drama. The
rest, at least, at some time have lived
their own lives. Parson Manders has
forever permitted his neighbor's yard
stick to be the measure of his ways-
Then there .is Regina. illegitimate
daughter erf Alving and one of the
Alving servant maids, who shows tho
parental taint In a brutal selflshneOT
and lively voluptuousness, and Enjr

penter of the Uriah Heep build, who
married Regina's mother for money.
With these five commonplace people.
a single set of scenery and for cos
tumes Parson Manders' black coat
and Oswald's gray one. Mrs. Alving*s
black gown and Regina's blue one, tha
drama works itself out in Its terrible
simplicity.
There is nothing fortuitous in the sit
uations save the burning of the Alving
Orphanage on the eve of Its dedica
tionâa coincidence so like life as to
seem incredible. There are no dropped
letters, pardons arriving at the last
moment, banks failing; neither, again.
Is there any "love interest." curious
local color, nor comic relief. Nor is
there even literary charm. The inter
est is purely psychological, the striv
ings and counter strivings of five naked
souls.
And you make your own sermons.
Ibsen does not even answer his own
questions. He keeps to himself any se
<rret of sympathy with his characters.
And yet with every ordinary dramatic
convention defied, with his brutally
commonplace material. Ibsen has made
a play that drives the blood from tho
heart and grip3 to its awful final word.
One Is grateful to Miss Alberta Gal
latin, who brought the play, for tha
opportunity to hear it. As Mrs. Al
ving she was not wholly a success,
though curiously most successful in its
more exacting moments. One recalls
Mr. Bcgel's Oswald most â¢ gratefully.
It is difficult to imagine the unfortu
nate youth more vividly conceived or
acted. The make-up was marvelous.
A perhaps necessary variety of shad-
Ing impelled Mr. Bogel to a display of
energy not wholly- compatible with Al
ving's condition, but otherwise it was a
startlingly convincing impersonation.
Engstrand again was cleverly handled
by John Ravold. and Rose Curry and
Allen Davenport filled 1U the cast with
out disaster. Come again. Miss Galla
tin.
"Ghosts," presented locally for the
first time this week at the Columbia
Theater, touched new nerves of pain In
the play-going consciousness. Lacking
any exceptional significance in its cast
save Claus Bogel. whose Orjvald cut
itself into the memory like ghastly
cameo, this Ibsen drama proved itself
among the most profoundly moving
pictures of human ills known to th-j
stage.
Some time ago Nance O'Neil gave us
"The Lady Inger of Ostrat." It seemed
then as though Ibsen had plumbed the
deeps of maternal suffering. Yet it Is
a more intimate note of horror he has
struck in "Ghosts." "Lady Inger,"
with its Maeterlinckian symbolisms.
Its antique heroics, is of the life apart.
In "Ghosts" you might be staring Into
your neighbor's flat. But Parson Man
ders? There are bine laws in Cincin
nati forbidding a man to kiss his wife
o* Sundays! For the rest the types
are painfully possible. Mrs. Alvlng.
widow of the Chamberlain Alving, Is
the good woman who, after one revolt,
.has "stayed b^' her dissolute husband.
She has borneNhlm a son. The llttla
chap, beginning to ask questions. Is
sent to boarding, school. His mother
throughout his school d.iys and art stu
dent days in Paris, weaves tender lies
about thÂ£ father for the son. Her final
lie Is the erection of an orphanage to
the memory of Alving. now dead.
For Oswald Alvings one may look
on the books at Agnew's, at Stockton.
There are terribly many of them. In
Paris the father's sins have found out
the son. "Worm-eaten from birth."
the physician tells him. He returns
home to await his fate and, crying
horribly for "the sun'" It comes upon
him. Nothing exceptional here.
I rather thought that I had dropped
into the wrong room -when I reached
Miss Helen Russell's the other day.
There was a usable looking: work bas
ket en the table with a neatly darned
stocking hanging over the edge. There
was a tiny lawn collar with a needle
sticking in its Half-finished bordering
of delicate feather stitching and other
soft, domestic truck about. And there
were two women before me who looked
like anything but burlesque queens.
"Miss Russell?" I asked, doubtfully.
The younger of the two put out a
shy, soft hand and confessed to being
Fischer's new leading lady.
If â¢â¢Gemini!" had been in my vocab
ulary I should have said it. It is with
in reason for a Mrs. Whiffen to look
like a bishop's lady, or an Ida Con
quest like a sweet girl graduate, but
It is the nest thing to a heartless
fraud on the public for a_ burlesque
queen not To look the part. And 'twere
rank profarity to picture Miss Helen
Rnssell stubbing: her toe on the chan
delier â in the immemorial fashion of
the queens of burlesque! She is the
kind of person â I thought as she seat
ed herself opposite to me â that you
would worshipfully ask for a recipe
for cooking ducks, that the small
boy would go to to get his nose
wined, that you'd be p'.ad to
have round after a hard day's
work. Handsome? Yes, in a comfy,
maternal wey. She has a pair of the
softest, kindest, shyest brown eyes you
can imagine, set in a small, oval face.
Her dark head is set upon a pair of
singer's shoulders, and Miss Russell is
more than common tail. I believe her
skirt was black. The simple waist of
dark b!ue silk, with its soft, small
white collar, had only a plain gold
breastpin as ornament.
I began: "They tell me this is your
first essay In. the burlesque line, Miss
Ruesell?"
"It is," she owned, with a little laugh
that would have been a giggle in a
slighter person.
"It must come curiously after your
other work?"
"They" had also told me that Miss
Russell had sung in grand opera and
with Scdchi.
"I like it." she said simply. "Not
that I mean to remain in it very long.
. I shall so back to grand opera. But I
thought the experience would do me
good, and then I have always wanted
to come to Saa Francisco."
"You wcre^in grand opera?"
"Yes, that is all I have done besides
a lilt;* concert work."
"With whom?"
* I was for two seasons with Scalchi
in operatic scenas â "
"That was in â "
" '96,'* she replied: "then I have been
with Signor Alberti most of the time
since."
â¢ Alberti?"
"My husband," Miss Russell ex
plained simply.
"Sh". Buriesque queens must not
have any husbands â in print." I ad
vised, and Miss Russell laughed like a
child and put up plump hands to hide
blushes that are not put up in pots.
"Hoy.- did you ever come into bur
lesque!" I wondered to myself, and de
termined to take in Fischer's* at the
first opportunity. I had not then seen
Miss Russell on the stage. Aloud I
eaid: "SigTior Alberti sings also?"
"Indeed, yes." his wife replied, still
all dimples. "Sijrnor Alberti was also
with Scalchi. He has a repertoire of
sixty-five operas. He gave me my
first engagement."
"And then another kind of engager
merit'' â she wns too tempting.
She blushed and laughed ?-.gain de
lightfully, aa she nodded "Yes."
"Where did you study. Miss Rus
sell?"
"Tirst in Chicago â I was a Chicago
girl," she replied, "but that didn't
count."
"Oh, Helen!'* her friend, introduced
pjs Mrs. Pickering, reproached.
"Well, it didn't," "Helen" said com
fortably.
"Then you believe in foreign
study?"
"Yes, indeed." nodding trltll^pl&cfd
energy. "I studied in Chicago and
didn't &n anything there â perhaps it
wfs my fault â and then deter
mined to go right to Italy. I went
dirootiv to Verdi to ask him about it."
"You went to ask Verdi about
studying?" I echoed. "Wasn't that a
daring sort of thing to do â or per
haps you knew him?"
"No, I didn't." Miss Russell contra
dicted. "You see I knew he'd know,
and I wanted to find out" â delightfuly
simple!
"And he helped you?"
"He was very, very kind," Miss
Russell said, gratefully, "and I'm so
happy to think I had the courage to
go to him. I went riffht to his palace
â¢ â at beautiful place! â in Genoa, and
he gave me letters to Busi in Bologna,
<Uie of the greatest teachers there
have ever been, I think."
"You don't seem the kind of person
to do that kind of thing." I murmured.
"Oh. I was never afraid of anything
then." Miss Russell rippled sleepily.
Her soft voice, In its Â»lazy, unruffled
flow, is as soothing as Mrs. Winslow's
syrup. She added, "In fact, I don't
think I am row."
"You spoke Italian V
"I spoke all I knew." she smiled.
"You know I was most fortunate to
get with Busl. He was very ill even
then, and had only one other pupil-
Rubinstein's son, by the way. I was
with him until he died, six months
afterward. I had <he last lesson he
ever gave. Busi was a great man.
He made many composers, conductors,
singers â you know he was head of the
Bologna Conservatory."
"And after Signor Busi?"
"I went then to Marches!."
"You liked her?"
"Oh. I wanted to go to some on- else
after I had been a few months with
her." the einger put In. "I went to
study with Mme. Laborde, Calve's
t teacher, after MarchesL She was very
good. I had two years !n Paris alto
gether. But I have learned much more
from Alberti than from any of them,"
the laughed.

There's something really worth while
in a union where suitability is the ba
sis upon which Jove is reared. Other
things being equal, it is the only safe
marriage. This sort of a marriage is
rarely carried with tears and recrim
inations and reproaches into the pre
cincts of the courts for annulment,
and for the psychological reason of
suitability. . What happiness could
exist beyond the saccharine honey
moon of a union twixt the but
ler and his mistress, or a banker
and his housemaid? Of the two
the latter would have the better
chance, but the exigencies of our pres
ent standards of living render "un
equal" matches things to be shunned,
if happiness in its best sense is to be
attained.
What a brilliant performance that
was- of Miss Celia Tobin's last week,
when she followed the hounds from
Burlingame, taking eighteen fences in
capital style. She finished with her
brother. Those who saw the young

proclaim her one of the best horse
women in the West â and in the West
horsewomanship (this is not Webster-

thing more than cantering through the

Moral: Let our girls stay "to hum,"

the knee" to idle, intriguing pensioners

Where, where else, indeed, than in

They can plan and execute a function

differing only a degree, the debutante
of the West differs from her proto
type in the East; for with the free

environment, and the inherent buoy

sun-kissed and lovely, volatile, yet
stable and gay, but grave when dis

"The imperial Government." said he,
"fully appreciates that Russia is not

has realized that Port Arthur needs a
stronger defense and' she is exerting

defensive position there.' There are
now 400 sains at Port Arthur, whereas

confronting Russia is the fact - that

Viceroy Alexieff and Baron de Ro

Japan does not claim a protectorate
over Korea. She only demands the

manner as to give Russia equivalent

based'more uponthe knowledge of the

previoufe phases of the controversy
rather than on any definite informa

Not even, the* Czar's * pacific utter

Senator McComas asked whether there
was any one present who appeared for
the person who charged Smoot with be

it must be borne in mind that Smoot
had positively denied it. He referred to

CHARGE IS UNSUPPORTED.

materially from the charges' made., in
the formal statements and "he asked
for time in which to make a reply,
which -was granted.
Worthington agreed that there was
no limit to the power of the-Senate'to
pass upon the nullification of its' own
members, but contended that its Juris
diction was limited.. Heathen "laid
down the general proposition that the
Senate was without Jurisdiction of of

mitted before a member became : a
Senator, unless committed in connec
nectlon with his election. ' l '
"Do you mean." asked Senator Pet

this body is not permitted to inquire as
to any moral quality as to one. of its

that no matter what he did or said be

3. As shown by their teaching and
by their own lives, this body of men
has not abandoned belief in polygamy
and polygamous cohabitation. On the
contrary, (a). as the ruling authorities
of the church they promulgate in the
most solemn manner the doctrine of
polygamy without reservation; (b) the
president of the Mormap church" and a
majority of the twelve apostles now
practice polygamy and polygamous co
habitation and so/ne of them have
taken polygamous - wives since the
manifesto of 1890.
4. Though pledged by Â¦ the i com
rwact of statehood and bound by the
law of their commonwealth, this su
preme body, whose voice is lg,w to Its
people and whose members -were -in
dividually directly responsible for
good faith to the A'merican people,
permitted without protest or objection
their legislators to pass, a law. nullify

POLYGAMY IS ALLEGED.
Taylor began hi3 statement i by
saying that he did not know that any
proof would be presented in support of
the charges that Smoot was apolyga
mist. He took up the question of the
right of the Senate to expel a member,
contending that, the Senate's authority
in the matter. was. limited only, by the
question of propriety. / On this point of
testimony, Taylor said, the protestants
expected to prove the . following
charges:
1. The Mormon priesth^aod, according
to the doctrine of the church and the
belief and practice of Its membership,
is vested with and- assumes to exer
cise supreme authority in all things
temporal and spiritual, civil and polit
ical. The head of the church claims to
receive divine revelations and these
Reed Smoot, by his covenants' and ob
ligations, is bound to accept and obey.
. 2. The first presidency and twelve
apostles, of whom Reed Smoot is one,
Is supreme in exercising the authority
of the church and in the transmission
of authority to their successors. Each
of them is called a prophet, seer and
revelator.

"If we were beaten," the Minister
resumed, "Russia would take Korea
and Manchuria by right of conquest,
and, possibly, Japan. No power ou
earth could then dislodge her from
Central China and all the Far East.
I am sure it is better to go to war
when you know you are right, even
when defeat is possible, than to sea your
independence submerged under a con
tinual aggression* that is bound to ab
sorb y6u eventually. Nothing can
avert war between Russia and Japan
in future years, even if peace is pro
cured now, so long as Russia pursues
her present Far Eastern policy.
"The American action in enforcing
the opening of the Manchurian ports!
was a splendid example of honest diplo
macy. It was a straightforward step,
which contrasts favorably with Rus
sian methods. No other nation, except
Great Britain, when the British Ad
miralty bought - the two Chilean war
ship?, has taken any practical step to
live up to its diplomatic demands upon
Russia anent the Far East. We be
lieve we are fighting a diplomatic bat
tle in behalf of America and Great
Britain; but, if only war can settle it.
we know we shall receive assistance
from neither. We are prepared. to fight
our own battles and take the conse
quences."
LONDON. Jan. 17.â In remarkably
frank language Baron Hayashi, after
consultation with the Foreign Office to
rilght, summed up the situation as fol
lows:
"I only hope the Czar will give U3
peace, but my hopes are not strong.
If we go to war it will be foy Issues
whereon both America and England
have insisted diplomatically. We have
received no pledges from any country
that, in the event of defeat, it will step
in and save us from being absorbed by
Russia. We cannot count even in ex
tremities on the armed support of any
nation in the world. It would be a
struggle to the death. Perhaps we are
not strong enough to fight Russia.
There are two opinions about that."
Baron Hayashi intimated that he
thought Japan was certain to be beaten
in the end.

ST. LOUIS. Jan. 16.â James Lawrence
Blair, who died to-day at Eustis. Fla.,
was 60 years of age. He was the third
son of the late General Francis 1 Preston
Blair of distinguished memory.
With the Inception of the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition Blair was made
general counsel for the enterprise. Mrs.
Blair was made president of the board
of* lady managers. With their two sons
they lived in a beautiful residence in
the suburbs west of the city and were
leaders in the social life of St. Louis.
Last October rumors were circulated
connecting Blair's name with alleged
fraudulent transactions Involving a
half million dollars in conducting the
affairs of the Blow estate of this city,
of which he was a trustee. The rumors
finally became published as facts. The
Grand Jury began an investigation.
Blair's resignation as general counsel
for the world's fair was tendered and
accepted.
INDICTMENTS ARE RETURNED.
The Grand Jury Investigation resulted
In indictments being returned against
Blair on two charges of forgery, and
he was placed under a $20,000 bond. Dur
ing v the investigation the family resl
detice was relinquished and Blair, bed
ridden by illness, was taken to a hos
pitalt being accompanied by his wife,
who never left his side.
As soon as a bond had ' been ar
ranged on ' the Indictments Mr. and
Mrs. Blairleft the hospital in Decem
ber and went to Eustis, Fla., in the
hope that his health might be bene
fited by the change of climate and
'environments. While in Florida the
of Mrs. Blair as president
bf the board of lady managers of the
world's fair was- tendered- to the na
tional committee and " accepted, and
Mrs. Daniel fanning of New York was
elected as her successor.
Blair's trial was to . have come up
during- the February term of the Cir
cuit Court.
EUSTIS, Fla., Jan. 16.â James L. i
Blair . of St. Louis died here to-day, j
Blair came to Eustis about five weeks j
ago in search of health and It was!
believed that he was improving until j
last week, when his condition changed |
alarmingly for the worse and the phy- [
s'lcians advised that his wife be tele
graphed for. She and her son, Percy
Bla^r, arrived this morning a short
time before his death.
Blair, Just before coming to Eustis. ;
held'the position of general counsel for
the St. Louis Exposiyon, and Mrs.
Blair, that of president of the â¢ lady
managers, which position she resigned !
owing to charges of misconduct against j
Blair.
Mr. Blair had sustained a severe in-
Jury to his ankle before coming here,
and this, with his mentaJ condition, is
believed to have hastened his death.
The cause' of death in the physician's
certificate is cerebral congestion. The
body was embalmed to-day and was
shipped to St. Louis to-night, accom
panied by Mrs. Blair and son.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 16.â A wreck,
caused by a collision between ajswitch
engine and a mixed freight and pas
senger train, running "wild," took
place in the Santa Fe yards at 5
o'clock this morning. Fireman W. S.
Kynerd was Instantly killed and Engi
neer R. W. Kelly was seriously In
jured. .The wreck occurred at. the
"Y" crossing, at Seventh street, where
a mixed train of empty box cars and
passenger coaches that had broken
loose in the upper yards, ran across
the track ia front of the switch engine,
which was going at the rate of about
fifteen miles an * hour. A dense fog
prevailed at the'time, which prevented
the crew of the switch engine from
seeing the approach of the train until
too late to prevent the collision or to.
enable the crew to escape by Jumping.
The switch engine and tender afrd sev
eral box cars of the "wild" train were
piled in a head. Â¦
. Engineer Kelly was taken out of the
wreck with a broken leg and badly
scalded from escaping steam. Fire
man Kynerd had been caught in the
impact and had his .life . instantly
crushed out. It took the wreckers
over two hours to â¢ rescue his body
from the debris of the wreck. There
was no one on the mixed train at the
time of the collision.
Mr. Plnchot saldÂ»his department de
sires to know wha't the pressing prob
lem is. He asked the question: "Would
it seem wise to withdraw the timber
land outside of. the Government re
serves to protect ft. from land grab
bers?" Most pi those present answered
In the affirmative. Mr. Pinchot later
discussed land questions with the mem
beYs of the Sacramento Valley Devel
opment Association, which met here
to-day.

to the proposed co-operative work in

present, being confined to his home by
illness.' - *W. S. Melick, secretary of the
State B,oard of Examiners, which has
charge of. the State's co-operative work
with ...the' Federal- Government, an
nounced that the purpose of the con
ference was to get- the sentiment of
California, through the State officials,
respecting the land problems confront
ing the Government. He was sure that
many who hold property In arid por
tions of the State are^not prepared for
such a sweeping, enactment a,s the
Hansbrough bill.. "What is desired, said
Mr. Melick, is the preservation of the
forests for present and future benefit,
as well, as irrigation for colonization
purposes.
States Surveyor General Woods de
clared that the lieu land law is a
vicious measure. The .Hansbrough bill
would not be of much benefit to those
who should be protected, he said.
State Treasurer Reeves said he never
knew of more than one man who lived
on Government land as the law re
quired. Men would make a pretense to
do so and then go back to town and
live.

You certainly know of some one who is sick â some sufferer who will be
grateful for the help my book offers. ' \
And that book tells of a way to help. â¢*TeIl8 of a way so certain. that I, as a
physician, offer that help on trial. The book tells how for 30 years in hospitals
and at bedsides I searched for a way to cure deep-seated and difficult diseases.
It tells how I perfected my prescription â Dr. Snoop's Restorative, ijow by sci-
entific experiment I traced out the causes that bring on chronic diseases.
' I found invariably that where there was a weakness, the Inside nerve's were
weak. Where there was a lack of vitality, the vital nerves lacked power. Where
weak organs were found, I always found weak nerves. Not the nerves com-
monly thought of, but the vital organs' nerves. The Inside â the invisible
nerves. Â¦-.'
. This was a revelation. Then my real success began. Then I combined ingre-
dients that would strengthen, that would vitalize these nerves.
?That prescription I called a restorative. It is known the world over now as
: Dr. Shoop' s Restorative. After that I did not fail to cure one case In each hun-
dred. In the extremely difficult cases, my failures for five years were one In
each forty treated. I found cancer Incurable. Cancer is for surgery, not medl-
I cine.
1 Then how to get this prescription to sick ones everywhere was my thought.
I must announce it in the public press. But. thought I. will they realize the, real
truth of my discovery, the real power of Dr. Shoop's itestoratlve? Then a way
came to me â like an inspiration. "I will offer it io the sick on trial. Then they
will know I am slncere^ â that my prescription Is unusual."
I wrote a reliable druggist In each city and village in America.' They agreed
to co-operate with me. Now by any sick one
Dr. ShoopY Restorative
Can be taken at my risk. For a full month I will let you use it entirely at my
risk. ' Â¦:'Â¦'' \ Â¦ ' - -
Send no money. Just, write me for the book you need. When I send it I will
tell you of a druggist near by who will permit the month's trial. Use the Re-
storative a month. Then decide. If you. say to the druggist, "It did not help
me," that will relieve you' of any expense'whatever. He will bill the cost'to me.
This is my way of clearing your mind of all doubt as to what Dr. Shoop's Re-
storative can do. â¢ Â¦ v "'â¢ Â¦.Â¦â¢'â¢-â¢. \ ...
- No matter how prejudiced, you cannot dispute this absolute security I of-
. fer. You cannot' resist an offer .like this if you are at all sick. If , you have -a
weakness, write me. If you can't do things like you used to do them tell me
about it. Write in confidence. As a physician I will tell you a way to help.

NEW YORK,' Jan.. 16. â The Finan
cier says: The striking feature of the
official statement of the New. York
Associated Banks last week was the
gain of $17,600,300 in cash reserve, an
amount Jl, 744, 100 in excess of the in
crease, which was estimated on the
basis of the traceable movements of
money during the week. The differ
ence is accounted for by the bringing
over .from the previous week of
51,838,000, which was the sum less
that week than the amount shown by
the official statement compared with
the estimated increase. The gain in
cash last w;eek makes a total increase
of $29,499,400 since the week ending
December 26,- 1903. The deposits were
increased last week by the unprece
dented sum of $35,555,500 and conse
quently the required reserve was aug
mented by $7,888,825.' Deducting this
sum from the gain in cash leaves
$8,494,775. as the increase in surplus
reserve, which now stands at $23,181.
750, against $20,217,125 at the .cor
responding date last. year. Calculated
on the basis- of deposits, less than
those of public. funds, the surplus is
$32,403,025. The loanswere. increased
by $18,403,400. and it is -noteworthy
that the gain in this item since the
week ending December 26 has been
$55,600,000. Another striking: feature
of the statement is loans. Thi3 is the
first time this condition has shown
since August 1 last year, when the ex
cess of deposits was $976,000: in this
interval the highest excess of -loans
over deposits was $39,900,900. Novem
ber 21. 1903. A further increase of
$15,813,100 in this item will carry the
total loans to the maximum of last
year, and also on record; an increase
of about $62,000,000 in deposits 'will
also make a new high record for this
item.- The specie is now within
$1,000,000 of- last year's maximum.

. Though the. mouth of the box is
thus completely exposed, the letters
drop, into the .compartment for them
through an Interior arrangement of
the "mouse trap'.* order, that pre'vents
their being taken out in any manner
through the'same chanelas that they,
enter. The exrerlment has been* placed

Wind, at the highest velocity, can
not blow even fine or "blizzard" snow
into the compartment for letters. Con
structed on the principles of the "cy
clone cellar," high winds will blow
over the mouth of the box. and those
of the "gusty" sorts enter a "draft" in
the box at one point, without the least
harm, while at the same time they are
arrested from so entering this draft at
another, by an ingenious "wind-buf

The box will hav.e some very inter
esting mechanical features. Besides
the one mentioned of the reception
into its absolutely vertical mouth, di
rectly and at all times, of rain. snow,

the public, at such times, without the
least injury from moisture to the let
ter either in passing into the box or
when within the same, It is what is
known as a "dripless" and "splash
less" open-top letter box. At no point
of the opening for letters can water in
any quantity be made to "rebound" or
to "drip" in any way.
terially, the postoffice officials state,
from the long, three-inch-wide car
box used in the experiment alluded to
and previously described in the Star,
but it has been enlarged in its dimen
sions to adapt it to its prelsent tempo
rary use on the street corner for
merely "testing," for two or three
weeks, its weather-proof qualities.
This, it is stated, is necessary before
adapting it in size and shape to the
cars.

The tiny church of St. Catherine's was
built 965 years ago by King Athelstan,
and was served by the monks from
Milton Abbey till the Reformation
swept them away. Since then it has

When asked by Rev. Mr. Maxey as
to how Jesus appeared, he said he was
almost always happy, except that at
times when he beheld this earth
steeped in sin an expression of sadness
overshadowed his face.
True to Roberts' prediction, on the
seventh day and at the very hour
named, he passed away â for the sec
ond time, his relatives firmly believe.
"That's strange; it seems to me I
have been gone a thousand years. I
have been In heaven and I have been
so happy."
He told of his meeting with his
father, who had long preceded him,
and other" relatives and friends. Many
questions were asked by Rev. Mr.
Maxey concerning heaven and the de
scription given by Roberts was won
derful. Among other things he said
the Lord sent him back to perform a
mission.
"But," said he, "I have just seven
days to remain on earth, when I will
leave you until we meet up yonder."
Roberts asked them how long he
had been gone, and when told three

Special Dispatch to The Call
The bond ' market has suffered
throughout the.week from the same re
pressive influences as that of stocks
and has shewn no important move
ment. United States 2's have declined
\'i, and the 3's have advanced M per
cent on call during thÂ© week.
The future net earnings of railroads
are expected to show the benefit of ex
tensive economies in reduction of-work
ing 1 forces and cutting down of expend!,
tures for movements which have fig
ured largely in expenses up to the
present time. The extreme case which
has developed in the njoney market
seems to leave little room for fear of
trouble on that ground. The payment
of $25,000 of Lake Shore notes and the
calling of 67%. per cent of the subscrip
tions to thQ $40,000,000 of new Lake
Shore bonds failed to create a ripple In
the money market. The inflow of funds
to Xew York has -stopped the import
movement of gold. or. the need for it.
But the December trade return, with
Its favorable trade balance of over $96,
000,000, is convincing proof that New
York's control of International ex
change remains unimpaired.
While the market has been pro
foundly neglected by the outside pub
lic no -important pressure to sell has
been in evidence and prices have npt
suffered during the week! It is un
certain how far this movement for
hesitation in New York may be mixed
with other influences since it is not
generally feared that war between
Russia and Japan would do any direct
harm to our industries or finances. It
is believed that the uncertainties nat
ural to the eve of a national political
campaign misht be sufficient in them
selves to induce a conservative atti
tude in the 1 financial world.
The decline of securities on account
of business inaction has been followed
by an upward movement. The senti
ment is hopeful, but actual develop
ments are awaited to induce conviction.
The iron and steel industry is especially
affected by conjecture and uncertainty.
Reductions in wages and other econo
mies are looked to for effect of" future
earnings. The heavy demand for cop
per, especially for European account,
is regarded as a probable corollary of
an improving market for iron and steel.
The future of railroad earnings is by
no means clear. The gross earnings for
the fount h week of December showed a
gratifying rise in the ratio of increase
over the corresponding period of last
year, but the roads so far reporting
for the first week in January fail to
Eustain the good record.
GOLD IMPORTS CEASE.
WAR TALK HARMLESS.
Operations by speculative pools in
minor stocks have offered the only
variation from the prevailing: monop
oly and the rumors set afloat to ac
count for these special movements
which accompanied the movements
have Droved impossible of verifica
tion. The manipulative operations
have been commented on and at least
one case has been the occasion . of
charges which threatened official in
vestigation by the Stock Exchange au
thorities.
But the stock market was disposed
to look a little askance at the loan ex
pansion of J1S.450, 400. Another week
of exDansion at that rate would bring
the loan' item of the banks to above
any figure on record, the highest rec~
ord for loans having -been reached in
the week ending February 21. 1903,
at $950,20S,700. Reports were . cur
rent of the' payment of a large loan
of long standing to one of the trust
companies, which may have involved
transfer of loan 'obligations to the
Clearing House banks. The market
closed steady but inanimate.
There has been no appreciable de
mand for securities this week, prices

idle most of the time.
NEW YORK. Jan. 16.â Within nar
row limits both as to price movement
and volume of dealings, to-day's stock
market was ragged and uncertain.
The handful of room traders who
made up the market had difficulty in
moving the urices at all. The under
tone was on the whole firm, although
there was some yielding in spots. The
further advances in minor specialties
were not impressive and did not serve
to give tone to the rest of the market.

eign markets on the war situation was
not followed here, but the semi-attrac
tion was attributed to the uncertainty
over, the matter. A rumor gained
some currency also that an early de
cision would be forthcoming on the
Northern Securities case, probably due
to the fact that Tuesday is the day on
which the Supreme Court renders its
decision. The gain of upward of $17,
000,000 in cash reserve as shown in
the bank statement proved to be
largely in excess of even the most san
guine preliminary estimates, which
were more than usually at variance.

Pretty soon he got some big contracts

at once. .â¢ â¢
. By-and-by came a big contract for
lumber for the "L" road, then build
ing here in New York. More men, big
ger mills, longer piers and more
schooners loading at them. Now it
was "Colonel" Darby.
"I got me a good pair of high-step
ping mares and a red-wheeled' top bug
gy, in which I drove about a good deal
looking after my numerous lumber
camps and gangs of men," as the Sen
ator tells it now, "and I smoked good
cigars, dressed well, talked some poli
tics and read the New York papers.
The first thing I knew they were ad
dressing me as 'General' Darby. It
was no use protesting. It had to 'go.'
And the country papers would now apd
then interview 'General' Darbyâ so I
was high-line all along the Gulf and
'up to road' into Alachua County."
Along came a Gulf storm one day in
the late autumn and the hurricane
swept the whole coast to destruction.
Next morning "General" Darby's
wharves and mills and booms and .ves

all put in the Gulf of Mexico, scat

poorer than when he went to bed the
night before.
He hustled to pull himself together
and save the foundation of a new busi

hill work. He paid all his men their
wages in full and let other creditors
waitâ a proceeding that kept him solid
with the people â but pretty soon some
body called him "Colonel" Darby one
day and in less than a month his. title
of "General" was a thing of the past.

had still further impaired his fortune

NEW YORK, Jan. 16. â Gabrielle
Bompard, the French woman who,
thirteen years ago, assisted Michael
Eyraud to commit a murder which
stirred Paris at the time, and whose
trial attracted wide attention on ac
count of the appeal to hypnotism as a
defense, arrived on the Lucania to-day,
but was immediately apprehended by
immigration inspectorsand ordered de
ported on the ground that she was an
ex-convict, having but lately served out
the service imposed for the murder.
Gabrielle and Eyraud in 1890 con
spired to kill and rob Antonette Guf
fey. The girl enticed Guffey to her
apartments and then assisted Eyraud
to strangle him. After the murder she
came to America with Eyraud, but later
returned to Paris and, urged by a
young man with whom she had fallen
in love, confessed her share in the
crime. At her trial it was contended
that she was a hypnotic subject, and a
hypnotist expert tried to secure parmis
slon to hypnotize, her in open court and
have her enact the crime, but the Jury
voted against the experiment. She was
convicted and sentenced to twenty
years' imprisonment, which, with com
mutation for good -behavior, recently
expired. Â¦.'.:â¢ '
The United States bureau of chemis
try when it began to enforce the pure
food law on imports last year found
that "the. American people have been
buying labels." Professor Allen says:
"The Germans are perhaps doing:
more for their food supply than any
other nation in the way of studying
methods to make it easier of enforcing
its findings. The action Germany has
taken with regard to our meats and
the action it will soon take with regard
to our fruits must not be considered
hostile. The Germans are protecting
the purity of their food supply.
"England," continued Professor Al
len, "is the dumping ground for bad
foods. Her food laws are insufficient
and poorly enforced."
LEXINGTON, Ky., Jan. 16.âRevela
tions of the impurity of foods 'in Eu

len has just returned from London,
Berlin and Paris, where he had been
sent by the association to make an in
vestigation of European food products.
Allen said:
. "I learn from the authorities of the
municpal laboratories of Paris that 60
per cent, of the. French wines and 80
per cent of their champagriea are either
adulterations or imitations, notwith
standing the French vineyards had the
greatest yield the past two years with
in a century, and pure wine itself had
been very cheap. Much of the wines
included in this 60 per cent never saw
a vineyard and the grape forms no part
of their composition." f .

A PLAGUE OF THE NIGHT.
Itching Plies ami Other Rectal Trou-
bles Easily Cured by a New
and Safe Method.
A Ecmarkable Number of Cures Made by
the Pyramid Pile Cure.
About one person in every four suf-
fers from some form of Tectal disease..
The most common and annoyins is itch-
ing piles, indicated by warmth, slight
moisture and intense, uncontrollable
itching in the parts affected. '
The usual treatment has been some
Jimple y ointment or salve which some-
times give temporary relief, but noth-
ing like a permanent cure can be ex-
pected from such superficial treatment
* The only permanent cure, for itching
piles yet discovered is the Pyramid Pile
Cure, not only for itching piles but for
every other form of piles, blind, bleed-
ing or protruding. The first applica-
tion gives instant relief and the con-
tinued use for a short time causes a
permanent removal o^ the tumors or
the small parasites which cause the
intense itching and discomfort of itch-
inff piles.
F. M. Collins of 440 Armitage avenue.
Chicago, says: "Some time ago I com-
menced using Pyramid Pile Cure for
a disagreeable case of itching piles.
After using five boxes I consider my-
self entirely cured of the disagreeable
trouble, thanks to this excellent rera-
: edy, and I shall never fail to recom-
j mend it to any of my friends who may
happen to be troubled as I was."
i The Pyramid Pile Cure is probably
the only pile cure extensively recom-
mended by physicians, because it is so
safe, so prompt in the relief afforded
and so far as known the only positive
cure for piles.
All druggists now sell it at E0 cents
per package.
Address the Pyramid Co., Marshall,
Mich., for book On cause and cure of
piles.
If suffering from any form of piles
ask your druggist for a package of
Pyramid Pile Cure and try it to-night.

It will be no misfortune, from the
standpoint of Asiatic tranquillity, if the
account given of a catastrophe to the
Orenburg- Tashkent -Railway by a cor
respondent of the Times be confirmed.
This long and costly line was almost
avowedly planned as a menace to Af
ghanistan and Northern India. It could
not have any other purpose; indeed,
the country through which it passes',
after leaving the Aral Sea, being chiefly
barren land, inhabited by an extremely
sparse and nomadic population. But
commercial considerations never count
for anything when any extension of
the Russian system of strategic rail
ways engages official minds at St. Pe
tersburg. The scheme was consequent
ly adopted, in spite, it is believed, of
some objection on the part of the then
Finance Minister on the ground of the
enormous outlay, and the Czar's sanc
tion havin? been . obtained, the work
was at once put in handl Later on an
other argument for pressing forward
its completion came to the front; it
would, said its promoters, shorten the
distance to the nearest point of the
Chinese frontier by no less than 2000
miles. After this brilliant discovery
money was poured out like water, and
to water it has returned. That mighty
but erratic river, the Syr Daria,
through whose valley the line passes,
has converted a continuous stretch of
fourteen miles into a lake fifty-six feet
deep and thirty miles broad. But there
i3 every probability that the inunda
tion will soon assume much greater
proportions, as the line passes for 330
miles through country liable to.sub
mersion whenever the Syr Daria- over
flows. It will be good news at Cabul.
where the ambitious undertaking, so
meaningless, except for war possibili
ties, has abvays been regarded as hav
ing for its primary object the subjec
tion of Afghanistan to Russia.

A report of a head-on collision was
received yesterday at Southern Pacific
headquarters here. At 2:30 o'clock this
morning a freight train ran into the
east-bound Atlantic express, which was
moving at the rate of twenty miles an
hour, near Woolsey, Nev. The fireman
and a brakeman on the freight train
were Injured and both engines were
badly damaged. No one on the passen
ger train was hurt.
Th'e accident is alleged to have been
caused by an error of the telegraph op
erator, who delivered orders to the
freight train stating that the express
was four hours late, when it was only
three hours behind time. N

In discussing th problem of irriga
tion the Secretary said the experts of
his department were studying the prob
lem of how to handle the soil so as to
conserve the water already available.
In this connection he mentioned the
sugar beet crop, which he said was
steadily on the increase despite the
dire predictions made at the time of
the passage of the Cuban bill. '
"We cannot now raise more than
seven and a half tons of sugar beets
to the acre," he said, "but with a con
servation of the water in the. soil by
cultivation we can increase this
amount, and when we produce fifteen
tons to the acre we can repeal all of
the sugar tariff laws with impunity."
The forests of the country, the Sec
retary declared to be disappearing at
an alarming rate. He asked for an In
crease of $100,000 additional for the bu
reau of forestry, declaring this to be
the time to inaugurate new methods in
forestry.
WASHINGTON', Jan. 16.â Although
the United States is deficient in creat
ing new breeds of animals, according
to Secretary Wilson, who outlined the
i policy of the Department of Agricul
| ture to the House Committee on Agri
( culture to-day, Sir Thomas Upton
j buys horses and pigs at Chicago. The
j horses, gaid the Secretary, he ships to
! Ireland and trains them as jumpers,
â¢ then sells them in Great Britain to
ten stone Englishmen" as Irish jump
ers. The pigs, of which he selects the
thin ones, he cans as "Irish bacon,"
which he also sells in England.
Secretary Wilson believes that the
United States can furnish the mounts
for the cavalry of Europe, with proper
study of the breeding of horses, and
the department is turning its attention
to this subject at the present time. The
only thing the United States has ever
produced in the way of new breeds, he
says, is perhaps a few breeds of hens,
although we have converted a running
horse into a trotter.

Chicago Record-Herald,
She Was Game.
In writing to her sister in this city
Sirs. Remington does not give full par
ticulars of the child's death, but says
that her information Is conveyed in tel
egrams from the Coroner, Sheriff and
Prosecuting Attorney of Freeport
County. It is intimated that the child
was made away with to get the estate.
Last Sunday, the day her son is said
to have been murdered, Mrs. Reming
ton was married to F. L. RIcMillin, and
she and her husband left for Freeport
last evening to investigate the death.
To-day Mr?. Seeley received word that
the train they were on was wrecked in
Nevada.
There was a mystery in the passing
of Dr. Remington that only came to
light after his death'. He was the heir
to a large fortune ; in the East. Mrs.
Remington learned of the matter, and
expected that her son Dayton would
inherit his father's interest. She com
municated with her husband's rela
tives, and as a result Mrs. S. Reed, a
sister of Dr. Remington, came to San
Francisco an<i on September 30 started
back to Freeport, 111., with the child to
claim his portion of the setate.
Mrs. Remington, who was living at
1220 Fclsom street, San Francisco, was
in straightened circumstances and con
sented to the child going. The boy was
"affected with disease of the spine and
was not strong.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 16.â Mrs. Mart See
ley of this city to-day received word of
what is considered the murder of Day
ton Remington, her five-year-old
nephew, in Freeport, 111., last Sunday.
The child was the son of the late Dr.
G. W. Remington and Mrs. L. F. Mc-
Millin of San Francisco, and was raised
at Modesto.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Intimation Made That the Life
of the Youth AVas Taken to
Prevent the Distribution of
, Property He Had Interest In
A. F. Nightingale, one of the trus
tees of the University of Illinois, to
day said:
. I think that e*ery State in the Union should
have a- laboratory for the manufacture of
anti-toxin serum for use In that State.
The horizontal increase Jn price made by
the trust means that the city of Chicago will
he compelled to appropriate double the sum
to do the same amount of charity work in
diphtheria cases for 1904 that It did in 1903.
Th'.s the city' can do, ana dpubtless will do.
but outside of this It must > be remembered
that this burden will fall heaviest on the
self-respecting, self-supportlntr heads of fami
lies of modest incomes. To all such, should
d'nhtherla invade their homes and they be
compelled to pay the Increased prices, the
burden put upon them by the anti-toxin trust
will Indeed* be erievous.
It should be noted that the increased prices
quoted by the trust to the city are the prices
of the manufacturerers to a Jobber. Thl3
applies not only to Chicago, but practically
to the entire country. The publicity already
given has aroused the medical profession to
the hlgHcst indignation and no doubt Â¦fM
result in some action speedily bein^ taken
to provide a supply of anti-toxin from sources
other than that of the combine.
The department felt compelled to call public
attention to the. evidence that a combine had
been â¢ formed which effectually controlled the
price for the only known remedy for the most
dread scouree to the child life of the coun
try. Primarily our object was to call at
tention . to the immediate effect .this would
have on the death rate of children in the city
of Chlcaso. Since the discovery of anti-toxin
the Deuartment of Health has done all In
its powtr to' encourage Its. use. It has fur
nished its. own medical lnsr>ectors to admin
ister and has provided the anti-toxin In alt
rases where peocle were too poor to pur
chase it.
CHICAGO, Jan. 16. â The Chicago
Medical Society and the Illinois State
Medical Association will, it is ex
pected, begin legal proceedings against
the anti-toxin trust under the anti
trust law. Secretary Pritchard of the
Health Department said to-day that he
had information to that effect- An
official statement regarding "the death
trust" in anti-toxin was issued to-day
by Secretary Pritchard. The state
ment says:
The antl-to.\In trust Is rothlng more or
less than a traffic in human life. Three con
cerns, which manufacture and practically con
trol the anti-toxin supply \>t almost the en
tire country, have seen fit to arbitrarily ad
vance the price of their product 1OO per cent.
This discovery was Tnafle by the Department
of Health of the city of Chicago, when In
ordering Its needed supplies for charity work
It was met with these Increased quotations.
The sole witness to-day was James
G. Cummlngs, stage carpenter of the
Iroquois Theater. He was evasive in
his replies, and Coroner Traeger re
buked him sharply several times.
Cummings' testimc-ny did not differ
materially from that of other stage em
ployes, save that he swore he had
shown a dozen of them how to open
the ventilators, and they unanimously
swore that nobody had ever \ shown
them anything about the ventilators.
Rev. Charles L. Roberts, rector of the
Camden-avenue Methodist Church, died
to-day of injuries received in the fire.
As a result of orders issued by Build
ing Commissioner Williams, only eight
of the twenty-nine churches closed for
violations of the building law will re
main wjth closed doors to-morrow. The
others will have a capacltv limited by
Commissioner Williams to con
sidered safe.
CHICAGO, Jan. 16. â But one witness
was heard in the Iroquois Theater in
quest to-day, and the Jury then ad
journed to inspect the interior of the
theater.
A lively debate took place when Dep
uty Cc-roner Buckley and the Jurors
entered the building. A force of de
tectives employed by the owners of the
building followed them around and in
sisted upon listening to all that was
said. They moved away only when
Buckley threatened to have all the de
tectives arrested.

MAKE PEACE WITH
YOUR STOMACH
You Are Certain to Lose IT You At-
tempt the Use of Force and Violence.
You cannot force your stomach to do
work that It Is unable and unwilling to
do. It 'has been tried. time and again,
with always the same result. The stom-
ach is a good and faithful servant, but
when pushed beyond the limit it rebels.
Some stomachs will stand much more
abuse than others, but every stomach
has its limit, and when that limit is
| reached it is a very dangerous and un-
j wise proceeding to attempt to force it
into doing further work. The sensible
and reasonable course is to employ a
substitute to carry on the work of di-
gestion and give the stomach an op-
portunity to recuperate and regain its
lost strength.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the
only perfect substitute to take up and
carry on the work of tired, worn-out
stomachs. They are natural and easy
I In their work and cause no disturbance
in the digestive organs. They contain
j all the essential elements that make up
the sastric juice and other digestive
fluids, and will digest any food that a
strong, healthy stomach will, and do it
in the' same time and in the same way.
They work independently of surround-
ing conditions, and the fact that the
stomach Is weak or diseased does not
influence them at all in their useful and
effective work. Thev will digest food'
just as well In a glass jar or bottle as
they will in a stomach. You can see
that for yourself, by putting one of
them into a jar with a square meal and
Eome water to enable it to work. â¢
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets by thus
relieving the stomach of Its work enable
that organ to rest and recuperate and
regain its health and strength. The
process is perfectly natural and plain.
Nature will heal the stomach just as
she heals a wound or a broken limb if
I she is not Interfered with and Is per-
mitted to-do her work In her own way.
All interference is prevented -by Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets,
i Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by druggists everywhere at 50
cents a box. . and if you are afflicted
with dyspepsia one box will make you
feel fifty times better. You will forget
you have a stomach and rejoice In the
forgetfulness. No druggist would be so
short-sighted as to try to get along
without Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, for
they are so popular and are so well
j known for^the good they have done and
I the happiness th,ey have caused that ,
any druggist caught without them
would lose the confidence of his cus-
tomers and be regarded as below, the'
standard. His business would suffer'as
a result and his patrons would go to
other stores and buy their drugs there,
as well aa their Stuart's Dysrepsia'.Tab-

The property'to be offered at the sale
Includes fifty-nine lots fronting^ on
Fourth and Fifth avenues and Hugo,
H and I streets, facing Golden Gate
Park. The streets surrounding the prop
erty have all been put in fine shape,
being sewered and bltuminised, with
Btone sidewalks laid in front of each'
block, granite curbs, gas and. water
mains in the streets and, in fact, every
thing done which will facilitate the
construction of Improvements on the
lots. The land constitutes a portion of
the tract formerly owned by the Sutro
estate known as Parnassus. Heights,
which was sold about eighteen months
ago to the City Realty Company, which
company has spent a large amount of
money in grading the tract and in lay
ing out a modern sewer system, and in
improving the streets by constructing
pavements which are better than those
to be found in any section.- of -the city

terms are being offered at the auction
sale, the idea . being to attract home
seekers arid give an opportunity to
those who wish to secure a, lot .upon
terms which .will enable them to pay
for the property in easy installments.
The cash , payment required is only 10
per cent of, the purchase money, and
the balance can be paid in semi-annual
installments extending over a period
of four and a half years. Judging from
the number of inquiries for catalogues
the sale will attract a number of pur
chasers, and competition for the lots
promises to be keen.

Another change made yesterday was
in the company's information bureau,

position with the St. Francis Hotel.
McMurray was tendered the appoint
ment of assistant . general passenger
agent in New Orleans, which is to be
filled by Batturs, but he declined it for
the place with the hotel company.
The vacancy in the information bu
reau is to be filled by P. R. Lund, who
for a year has been chief train agent
of the company.: He is regarded very
highly by the railroad officials, and his
promotion is considered as well de
served by his fellow employes in the
passenger department.
'A number of changes In the passen
ger department of the Southern Pacific
Company were announced yesterday
by Passenger Traffic Manager E. O.
McCormick, to take effect on February
1. Frank E. Batturs, chief clerk to As
sistant General Passenger Agent Don
aldson, has been promoted to the posi
tion of assistant general passenger
agent on the Atlantic system, with
headquarters at Xew Orleans.
The promotion is in recognition of
Batturs* long service with the company,
whose employ, he entered in 1S86. By his
energy and ability he rose rapidly in
the service from an" assistant ticket
agent in the Third and Townsend street
office to the position of chief division
clerk in the ticket auditor's office, and
from' there to the chief clerkship in the
office of Assistant General Passenger
Agrent Donaldson, where he earned a
vide reputation as one of the cleverest

able and such as only a despot would
impose. He continues:
Governor Peabody may imprison
miners and obscure men and weaken
their cause- before the public by
charging them falsely with many
crimes, but he cannot do that with
me. In my case the question of ar
citrary power, used at discretion,
must distinctly and solely arise and be
settled to his ruin if not sustained.
**I commend to the consideration of
the Constitutional Rights League the
criminal clause of that act. Under it
all of Peabody's tools and accom
plices can be sent to penal servitud?
and his pardoning power will avail
them nothing."

of friendship between the contending
factions. He stated also that the asso
ciation wanted a greater San Francisco
and that this city has the most won
derful future of any in the world. He
then Introduced Mayor E. E. ! Schmitz,
who said he.was in favor of the greater
San Francisc*.
Prince Tokugawa, who has Just
been elected President of the Japanese
House of Lords, ia one of the most In
teresting personages In the dominions
of the Emperor of Japan. For. he
may be described as the' last of the ty
coons. True, he held power as such
for only a few days, for it was his
elder brother Yoshinobu who was the
temporal ruler of Japan at the time
of the great revolution of 1867 and
1868. which ended the restoration of
the lay sovereignty of the Land of the
Â¦Rising Sun to the Mikado, after he
andjiis ancestors had been deprived
thereof, and forced' to 'content them
selves with mere ecclesiastical . supre
macy for close upon 300 years by the
tycoons. Yoshinobu, when he realized
that his power was threatened, dis
patched a mission to France, to Eng
land and to this country, at the head
of which he â¢ placed ' his ' younger
brother, now Prince Tokugawa. . The
latter .was received with the utmost
distinction by Napoleon^ III, who in
vested him with the Grand Cross of
the Legion of Honor, and by the Eng-*
fllsh court, King Edward, then Prince
of Wales, traveling: down to Dover to
welcome him on landing on British
soil. The outbreak of , the insurrection
compelled him to hasten home, with
out fulfilling his mission to the United
States, and Tycoon Yoshinobu, when
he found that h<s adherents were.de
serting en masse to the Mikado, made
a vain effort to save the throne, which
his family,. had usurped, by abdicating
in favor of his young brother, who
was tycoon or shogun for only a few
days before " being finally overthrown
and forced to yield to the present Em
peror and to his -victorious army.
The , Mikado dealt . very generously
with the two -ex- tycoons, and as soon
as ever* they, had ? made their.submis

upon each of them large estates and a
very handsome annuity. Yoshinobu,
the elder of the two brothers, died a
number of years ago forgotten and In
obscurity, but the younger brother, a
perfect specimen of the high-bred,
blue-blooded Japanese gentleman, the
distinction of his appearance and
manner suggesting to the mind a full
blooded race, horse, determined to
lead a. more useful life. Devoting the
greater portion of his allowance and
of his property to the maintenance
and to the pensioning of his former
adherents, who had suffered in his
own cause and In that of^hls brother,
he started out to. complete his educa
tion according to Western ideas, visit
ed this country at the time of the Cen
tennial Exhibition, and then went on
to Paris, where he took up his resi
dence in the most unassuming manner
in a small suite of three rooms in the
Quartier Latin, living the life of a stu
dent, none of his associates having tbre
slightest idea of his antecedents or of
his rank. Only on three occasions did
He said he was not opposed to civil
service reform, that is, if it had a fu
ture, and if it was to have a future "he
wanted to'know it." He said that when
he proposed this reorganization he had
hoped everybody would have been with
him, but he was sorry to say that he
had been mistaken in his stand, for
the Merchants' Association had taken
an entirely different view. ,
The next speaker was F. J.. Symmes,
president of the Merchants' Associa
tion. He had a retort for Mayor
Schmitz regarding the Health Depart
ment changes and said: "Let us go
into the courts and see what they will
say. â¢ ' .
"We are here to stand for a greater
San Francisco," he went on. "We know
what this city wants, and we are go
ing to have it. We don't want our
children to look back and say that their
fathers were 'chumps' and did not un
derstand or appreciate how great was
going to be the growth of this city. We
want to give up the old-fashioned ideas
of the past. We want to have all the
parks beautified and we want to pur
chase all the sites of vantage.
"This city will have 1,000,000 people

There is a falling off in the East In
the demand- for structural steel, which
Is due largely to. the. labor troubles.
BuiMlng operations were largely cur
tailed In New York and other Eastern
centers of population because of the
Ftrikes that brought an element of un
certainty into : the 'cost* of -buildings to
be erected. Many large buildings are
reported to have remained uncompleted
for months awaiting some change.
Possibly the slump In the price
of pig iron will., bring the re
ductions in cost . that the project
ors of buildings were hoping for. Of

creditors, fully, one-half, it was said

but they are for very small figures ac
cording to the statements of Attorney
Hutcbihson. The creditors have en
gaged Attorney Gregory to r represent
them in the court proceedings. Yes
terday accountants were busy investi
gating the books of Church!
It was alleged that they threatened
to import pig Iron to San Francisco on
a large scale if he did not make the
importations. He had 'already an ac
cumulation of iron here, and if this
threat had .been . carried out there
would have been here in the local mar
ket, an element that would have caused
the falling of prices and Church would
have been sure to lose. So he ventured
and events that he could not have fore
seen led. to his downfall financially.

lustrates anew the proverb that it is
an ill wind that blows nobody good.
The orders that were placed for pig
iron that has recently arrived in this
city from Europe date back for several
months, and the same applies to car
poes that are abroad for which ships
to brine them have not even been chat
tered. These later cargoes will come
forward on a falling market if local
predictions are fulfilled.
Of Church's three leading creditors.
Meyer, Wilson & Co stand to lose the
most, for the reason that they had
more cargoes ordered. Indeed, that
was a story current yesterday that the
creditors of Seymour B. Church were
responsible to some degree for the size
of his failure.

According to the general discussion
of the .situation yesterday as carried
on - by those skilled in the pig iron
trade in this city the foundry men are
now likely to buy in small quantities
only. On the great accumulation of
pig Iron in this city, present and in
cargoes that are contracted for
abroad, charges must accumulate, in
terest, etc. So the foundry men and
others have an advantage which 11-
As late as last June the Eastern
iron men were speculating that it
would certainly be one year at least
before Birmingham pig iron would fall
as low as $12 a ton. Now It is $9 a
ton and. so far as San Francisco is
concerned, it may go some lower.
EASTERN" MEX SURPRISED.
One cause is the entanglements of the
great steel trust. Another is the cut in
rail rates to the Pacific Coast on pig
iron. The steel trust a few months ago
had under contract the entire output of
every furnace in the entire Eastern
States. The price of pig iron soared,
and the scarcity enabled the San Fran
cisco importers of the iron to pay rail
rates on iron and sell it as far east as
Denver, where it was greedily absorbed.
To-day the steel trust does not
want the pig iron. The transconti
nental roads that are doing business
on the Pacific Coast have seen their
chance restored for a great long haul
business in pig iron. They are con
sequently enabled in conjunction with
th<? slump in the market price for pig
iron to put the commodity in the
hands of the manufacturers of every
interior terminal point in California
and the entire Pacific Xorthwest and
Â«t L,os Angeles as cheaply as the San
Francisco importer can lay down the
imported article. .
Owing to these causes the market
of San Francisco iron importers has
been wonderfully curtailed. Last
summer the iron business of this city
was thriving as far north as Puget
Sound and as far south as Los An
geles. Now the San Francisco trade
territory is strictly confined to this
city and the country around the bay.
where th^re Is cheap water transpor
tation from the wharves of San Fran
cisco.
The story of the failure of Seymour
B. Church as it is told by the iron men
of the city is based upon such unusual
causes and dates for its origin back to
events of such great and engrossing
importance that the cojlapse involves
more than the ordinary elements of in
terest.
INFOUESEKX CAUSES.
The iron has some value, of course.
Just v.hat this value is cannot well be
determined, for thft tendency is still
downward. The three firms will lose an
amount that is variously figured from
$60,000 u;i to $300,000. The latter- figure
is evidently far from the real mark,
for the reason that the Birmingham,
Ala.. Â»>ig iron, that fixes the price for
all pig iron as surely as Greenwich
stands for uniformity in time, can be
laid down in San Francisco for about
$22 Â«Â¦>') a ton, including the freights, so
experts say. Therefore as the iron is
not a total loss by any means there
must he a large deduction from the
outside figure of 5300.000 to estimate the
real truth even approximately.
Nevertheless for months to come car
gots of j>iÂ£ iron bought in England and
uther European countries for him will
be sailing into the port of San Fran
cisco. They are contracted for. Church's
operations have been large. There are
16.000 tons of pig iron that are involved
in the outstanding contracts and in the
accumulations of iron in Church's
yards in this city. He has no money, to
pay for that iron. The loss, the amount
of which it is difficult to estimate, will
fall principally upon the three large
firms mentioned, Balfour. Guthrie &
Co.. Girvin & Eyre and Meyer, Wilson
& Co.
Next Tuesday morning Seymour B.
Church will file a petition in insolvency
in the United States District Court,
through his attorney. Joseph Hutchin
son. His assets have all been Bwept
away. Balfour, Guthrle & Co., GIrvin
& Eyre and Meyer. Wilson & Co. are
his principal creditor*. They lose heav
ily. Pig iron made Church a magnate
in certain circles for a long time. The
collapse in the price of pig iron, which
is now Â¦worth about $10 less per ton in
San Francisco than it was a fe^v
month* ago, primarily caused his
downfall. A number vt weeks ago
Church kneTv that the downward ten
dency of the market was dangerous to
him. His friends say that he will not
go out of business, but that he will re
sume only as a broker, and not as an
importer of pig iron.

All of the appointees have been con
nected with the National Guard of # thiÂ»
State for many years, and Major Camp

lieutenant in the First United States
Volunteer Signal Corps in the Philip

The inspection of the various organ- {
izatiess of the National Guard of the j
State of California, which was to have
been commenced during the early part
of last week by Colonel Thomas Wil
helm, U. S. A., were Interfered with
by the action of the War Department. !
Tills action was due. to the reorgan- j
ization of the Department of the Pa- J
cific, the rules governing which went Â¦
into effect last Friday. .Under the proi ;
visions (d the rules the United States J
inspector/'of the National Guard will j
have to report to the division comman- j
der. General MacArthur. for orders, j
The inspections must be completed by
May 1. and the reports forwarded to j
Washington, through the division com
mander, not later than June 1. It is
expected that the inspections will com- j
mence during the current week. The ,
organizations to be inspected are the
signal corps, four batteries of coast Â¦
artillery, four troops of cavalry, forty- j
seven companies of infantry and one
company of Veteran Reserves. j
The War Department at Washing
ton is responsible for the peculiar con- }
dition of affairs by which the various
organizations of the State were fur- Â¦
nished with Krag-Jorgenson rifles, but
not with belts and ammunition. It ap
pears that the department, after order
ing the distribution of the new arms
to the guard, issued an order setting j
aside that part of the former order ,
relative to furnishing Webb belts far ;
holding cartridges for the reason that
it desired to furnish a new style or
belt with " "pocket holders" for car
tridges instead of the old-style belt 1
with "thimble holders. 1 * An order has j
been issued to furnish California. oOOO
of these belts, together with the re- {
quisite amount of ammunition. This j
will be dcr.e within a. short time. \
At various times during the last six t
months efforts have been made by in- â¢
spectors and officers high in the ranks
to inculcate the necessity of neatness

REGULATION CUT PREVAILS.
There was a proposition to issue to j
the "non-coms" and the men cut but j
unmade uniform coats and to give such j
officers and men the option ef having <
them made up according to "regulation :
sizes" or of taking the goods and hav- ;
ing the same at a small cost, at their
own expense, made to fit by any tailor j
they misht select. But, by the votes' s
of the majority, the motion of Colonel
WUhelm to that effect was lost. A .
great many of the members of the j
guard who expressed themselves as j
willing to have c6ats made up to fit j
at their own expense will be dlsap- j
pointed.

A lady of Washington says: "My
baby, 19 months old. had never seen a
well day In her life. She had, suffered
I from indigestion from the time of her
j birth and It seemed impossible to find
[ any food to agree with her. She could
j keep almost nothing on her stomach
I and her bowels were In Buch a constl-
â¢ pated condition she suffered a great
; deal.
"It was then that I tried Grape-Nuts
j for her, steeping It thoroughly and
Â¦ straining it, putting a small portion In
i each feeding, and It worked like a
i charm. She began . to improve Imme-
, dip.tely and gained half a pound the
first week.
"Baby got her indigestion from, me,
for my digestive organs have always
been weak. I rely on Grape-Nuts for
most of my. tpod, for there are times
when I can eat nothing else, at all but
Grape-Nuts. I am steadily improving,

It is no mean critic who is authorized to fill a column
of space on the editorial page of the Mail. He writes of
Patti as the chief* star of the firmament of song. Her
concert drew an audience that filled the vast audi
torium of Albert 'Hall.' and fMerry says that neither "Pad
erewski, Kubelik and his Countess, or even Melba" could
do that. He adds:
"The Patti concert is a banquet of superfluities. , The
grand organ, a Wagner overture by,- full' orchestra, a
famous violinist, a noted pianist, and other eminent^vo
caiistsâ all simply padding to fill up the spaces between
two chief performers. When the moment has arrived a
low murmur begins in a. distinct corner of_ the hall\ and
swells like the roaring of surf. Then steps, forward a
little "woman, youthful, active,, self-possessedâ it is- Patti.
The orchestra begins â and a hush greets the opening
notes of Mozart's 'Ba(ti, Batti.'" '
With the fervor of the faith of a true enthusiast,
"If you have, not heard .the Patti voice before you, mny
WE have had Patti's farewell concerts. We have
seen her, we have heard her; and in addition we
have dulv listened and heard comments noon her
by all our local writers and talkers. The enthusiast
and the cynic, the gentle amateur and the Sir Oracle of
criticism, the veteran who heard her in her prime a hun
dred times, the youth who never heard her before; the
man who strives to say the true thing and the man who
prefers to say'the bright one, all have had their chance
to talk and they have thoroughly used it.
We have thus heard in full the voice of San Francisco
on the Patti of to-day, and it has been a -confused, voice,
a repetition as it were of the babble of the multitudinous
seas. , Now this Sunday morning in the first moment of
calm that comes after the chatter that broke forth over
her person and her singing, it may serve as an instruc
tion as well as an amusement to learn what London
thinks of Patti. and thus have the benefit of measuring
our judgment by the standard of th^t of the critics. of
the gray old city where Edward is King, where our
Kirls go to get Dukes, our dudes to get trousers, and our
men and women of genius to get a recognition denied
them at home.
Among "our London exchanges just received is a copy
of the Daily Mail containing in the place of honor on
the editorial page a column article by Frank Merry on
Patti's appearance at a concert at Albert Hall. Read at
th'.s moment in this city, it appears indeed a frank, merry
criticism, for it gives the gay ha-ha to many an aspiring
critic who would doubtless like his musical judgment as
well as his trousers to be deemed true to the latest Lon-
LONDON'S VIEW OF PATTI.
Excitement in a mild form has ruled at the Presidio
for several days because of certain experiments being
made in reference to the adaptability of a new hash to
the seasoned stomachs of Uncle Sam's fighting men.
The hash has been administered in measurable quantities
and nobody has died. It is safe to announce, therefore,
that our troops have once more met the .enemy an'd vic
tory, even without internal disturbances, is ours.
. Elephants differ greatly in disposi
tion and in capacity. Some are intel
ligent, others dull and senseless; some
*re brave, others are cowardly. After
I somewhat extensive acquaintance
R-ith the elephant I have modified my
ideas considerably regarding his gen
eral sagacity. This has been very
much exaggerated. There is no rule
by which you can calculate before
hand what an elephant will do. If
he is taken by surpris* his first Im
pulse will be to run, but if he Is
tware of your presence he may charge
apon you like fury Incarnate. Hi3

Setter at a distance than close up.
I have crouched behind bushes or ant
hills on the plains where I could see
them * ell 200 or 300 yards off. When
they got my scent they would lift up
their trunks horizontally and turn
them about, then give a snort and a
trumpet blast and start off. It seems
that an elephant cannot smell well
vith his trunk down. On the other
nand. he cannot stretch his probiscis
out straight, as is often seen In cur
rent pictures, as it is a physical im
possibility.
The butt ends of the tusks are Just
behind the eyes. The under lobe of
? he proboscis is almost a*: long as the
upper, and the ears of the large Afri
can elephant are elliptical, not point
ed. An African elephant with a point

ball ran the whole length of his body,

heart was torn to pieces by the bat

as the acquiring of a university degree.

Elephant hunting is of all occupa
tions in Africa the most Interesting,
dangerous and profitable. The natives
almost worship the successful elephant
hunter. His renown precedes him, and
he is welcomed in places inaccessible
to the ordinary explorer. The flesh of
the elephant furnishes him with the
means of living; and in some localities
it is wc-rth more than the tusks.
BT WILLIAM STAMPS CHERRY.
[African Traveler. Explorer and Big Game
Hunter.]
â¢ I'opjrirht, 1904. by Josrph P. Bowie*.)
Most people imagine that tiger or
lien hunting is far more dangerous
than hunting the elephant. They know
more about thesÂ»* catlike beasts, whose
ferocity, cunning and courage are
proverbial.
Few know what a mad elephant
means, or that the elephant can be
as mad to the square inch of surface
R5 the lion or tiger. The average ob
server thinks the elephant awkward
or clurr.syâ a great mistake; but his
knee joints, boins so low in the front
legs and so high in the back, give him
a motion so unusual that to one un
familiar with hi? appearance he looks
Ftiff legged. Critical observation will
show that a lion or does not
handle himsplf with greater ease or
precision than does the elephant. His
movements are masterly, and in the
forest, where he is at home among the
grandest vegetation of nature, they are
seen in perfect harmony. While a
horse in heavy African grass would be
as awkward as a hog on ice and could
not force himself through the tangled
mass at all. the elephant will run
through it and tear through almost
impenetrable forest as rapidly as a
horse can run over a smooth racetrack.
Th<; elephant's tusks are set close to
gether at the points, with only enough
opening between to give his trunk play.
They are like cowcatchers, and separ
ate the bush as he goes alone;. His
feet and legs are well adapted to go
ing over logs and rc-ugh mountainous
land; hÂ«> can penetrate places where
horses cannot go, and when he charges
in the bush I would rather have a brace
rrf lior.s or tigers after me than that
one mad elephant.

be a little puzzled, not to say disappointed. It is. em
phatically not a big voice â a small voice of 'exquisite
tone â diamonds on a thread â which carries with the
clearness of a silver bell in the largest hall or opera
house. You begin to note the deft, .sleight-of-hand way
of getting from one note to another, and then the haunt
ing beauty of the tone. By this time you have become
a Patti enthusiast yourself. At your elbow is a certain
well-known musicianâ one of those irritating . kind of
people who have been everywhere, heard everybody,
and who consequently know everything. 'Urn â noth
ing to what she used to be.' he murmurs. "When I
heard her in "The IJarber " ' At once you Remember
that Mmc. Patti should be a lady of sixty â but you can
not realize it."
London is not the city from which one expects such
exuberant laudation as that, and of course there arises
a desire to know the cause of it. Merry insists that
Patti sings to-day more enchantingly than any other
woman can sing. and. in explanation says:
"Adelina Patti is one of the remaining representatives
of the 'Bel Canto' school of singing. Its methods were
apparently simple. You treated your voice as an instru
ment â played scales and five-finger exercises upon it half
the day; alternately bullied it and coaxed it, until, goaded
to desperation, it developed incomparable qualities of
both brilliance and softness, such as no other method
can imitate. And this voice need never grow old."
Such is the voice of critical London qji the Patti of
to-day. It is the voice that will greet her when she re
turns from her American tour. She will perhaps hear
it roaring from another great audience in Albert Hall,
and read it next morning on the editorial pages of the
most sedate and conservative of newspapers. Would it
be strange then if that gray old city of .smoke and fog
should seem to her full of brightness and beauty; would
it be strange if she greeted it by singing more tenderly
than ever -> before the heart's own melody, "Home,
Sweet Home"?
Barley Song. r * j | k
Sweet is the matin voice of birds
At early dawn in summer weather;
Sweet are the bells of distant herds
At twilight coming home together.
And sweet the brooklet's pearly note
Adown the rocky hollows leaping;
But sweeter yet the songs that float
In winds o'er fields of barley sweeptn*.
I love to list, 'mid Insects' hum.
While quails are piping In the mead

As o'er the hilts the reapers come.
And shorter grow the morning shad

To music of the rustling sraln
And dream of alt the coming pleasure.
When we Its lif<Â» juice oft shall drain
And revel in its amber treasure.
Th*n. as with keen delight .we drink
The sparkling nectar, foamy-crested.
While songs go round and glasses clink.
Ard every draught's with joy invested.

"Quartz' on Conversion.
"I reckon there ain't 'many of us
left that remembers how Rattlesnake
Pete was convarted," said "Quartz"
Billings remlniscently. "Pete was a
bad one. Half a dozen swigs was
enough to set him goin' so fast that
these yer autermerbeels ain't a mark
to his gait. One day Pete was In his
tantrums and he run acrost a little
tenderfoot that hed just stepped offen

" 'Wai. stranger, Jir.e me in a drink.*

" 1 do not drink, sir,' mildly replies
the little feller. â¢
"The gang perched on . the hotel

was ructions, but not the kind they
expected. 1
" 'See yere, you white-faced squaw. I
you drink, and you drink now, and
you drink with me.' declares Pete.
"And he pulls his gun and com
mences to shoot. Â«The gang, wise
from experience, jumps to shelter.
"The little man just quietly lays
down a book on the steDs and then he
gives one jump, knocks Pete's pistol
afiying and lands Pete in the mud.
The little feller has Pete by the throat
and he chokes old Rattlesnake til' he
gurgles black in the face.
"Then the stranger turns to the
crowd that had come out of hiding.

the gospel, and I'm going to preach it I

" 'Got enough?'
" 'Sure.* says Pete, groaning.
" 'Come to church Sunday?' says
the preacher.
" 'Sure,' says Pete.
" 'Get up,' says the preacher.
"He did, and Sunday 'Pete' went to
church and for six months the camp
was as quiet as a prayer meeting. The

The local fraternity of pugs, numerous and prosper
ous-in the smiles of mistaken official favor, is aghast at
the offer of fifteen thousand dollars for a "contest" be

public to believe that it will guarantee such a sum for
such, a spectacle. We arc either very prosperous or

A CURE FOR SANTO DOMINGO.
Her Help.
There is a little woman over In Oak
land who was recently left with her
little ones to fight the battle of life
aione. Bravely she faced the problem
and right well did she struggle to make
both ends meet with the little which
she had. But occasionally when she
was alone and the memories of the
days that -had gene came upon her she
could not keep the tears back.
One day the widow was sitting in the
darkened parlor looking at a picture
which was framed around with autumn
leaves, when. she felt a light touc. upon
her ebow. One of the little girls nes
tled her curly head down in the moth
er's lap and looked up into her face
with eyes that did not understand.
"M ther," said the little ne, "are we
very poor?"
"No. my dearest one, notâvery
poor."
\'M:.mma, how much bread would five
big dollars buy?"
"Why, my dear, that would bring us
enough bread to last two months," re
plied the mother, with her hand on the
curly head.
"Well, mummsy," whispered the little
one, with her head on Â¦ the mother's
shoulder, "you take the 55 my god
mother - ve me. You can buy the
bread and we can borrow the b' *ter."
Engineer of Skyscraper.
New York's great skyscrapers are
operated very much like battleships,
says the New York World. The center
from which the skyscraper is controlled
is the machinery hall far below the
street level. The commander Is the
chief engineer. A mighty man in his
own dominion is the chief engineer.
He is above the ordinary mechanic in
knowledge of machinery, for he is In
command of engines and dynamos that
must be handled with extreme delicacy
and precision. He is a clever executive,
for his supervision extends not oniy
over the men in his own little kingdum
below ground, but up throughout th-?
entire twenty or thirty stories of the
building. He is a man of good educa
tion, for he comes Into contact with a.'l
professions â all manner of- men vrh'j
make up the hisrh business Itfe of th*
metropolis. He Is a man of experience
both in his own particular sphere and
in the world in general. His activities
and responsibilities are so varied, as to
executive, scientific and administrat
ive functions, that he might be likened
to the Mayor of a city, or to a captain
of industry controlling hundreds of
workers, as well as to the captain of a
battleship.
The chief engineer of the New Tork
skyscraper is usually the superintend
ent a!so. The two offices are combined
in most of the large downtown struct
ures. He is supreme In h!s lofty castle.
This is to say he Is in charge of a
property which costs as much as many
a battleship, for the Investment outlay
represented In the latest type of twenty
to thirty story skyscraper in* the finan
cial district ranges from two to six
million dollars.

A Stranded Groom.
A few days ago a tall, handsome
young fellow, fairly well dressed, ac

"Certainly." said the Judge, leading
the way to his chambers.
"Judge," said the young fellow, as
he sank Into one of, the jurists easy

marry a very fine young lady before
January 13. The time is pretty near,

REVOLUTION in Santp Domingo swings merrily
on. From the tops of trees and the balconies
of houses the supporters of two rival political
grafters pop off their guns in the divine name of liberty
at anything which offers an easy mark. Business is at
a complete standstill. Pillage and arson are of such
frequent occurrence that the p'ress reports accept them
as a matter of course, mere commonplaces. The Ger
man papers arc waxing sarcastic over the affair and
drawing lessons from our benevolent Monroe doctrine.
Commander Dillingham of the cruiser Detroit has re
ported to the President that the lives and property of
Americans are daily in jeopardy. In short, it is the
old revolutionary mare's nest all over again.
First it is Hayti, then two pot-boilers in Salvador fall
at outs and there is more popping of the detestable little
guns. Hardly has trouble been assuaged on the main
land than off in the water somewhere a miniature vol
cano spits and froths, and our ships must hasten there
to protect American interests. Nigh onto a centcry of
this intolerable, thing, since the immortal Bolivar and a
few Irishmen cut the yoke of Spain; and yet every
recurrence of the dog-days and each succeeding solstice
witnesses one of these play wars. The British Bahamas
have no such' troubles; the Danish West Indies suffer
no such intermittent fevers of brawling; the Trench
possessions are* peaceful; yet practically the same people
inhabit all the Carib islands. It appears then that only
a strong government -by others than themselves can
insure continued peace in all this ntst of buzzing
hornets*
What must be the policy of the United States in the
future when the constant brawls on all sides will hamper
our digging of- the canal and the proper operation of.it
when once it is completed? Shall the question be solved
by annexation? President Andrew Johnson in his
fourth annual message called attention to the wearisome
condition of affairs upon this very island of Santo Do
mingo and urged that.it be made a part of the United
States.. General Grant continually urged from the Presi
dential chair, the necessity of putting a stop to the
brawls on the same island by annexation. That was
twenty-five years ago, before our country had a thought
toi the islands of the- sea, and when even the purchase
of Alaska raised a storm- of . protest from those who
sought to hew close to the line of precept laid down
by the .early Presidents. Since that time we have
acquired Porto Rico, the Philippines, Guam and our
share of Samoa." We arc to have sovereign^ authority

We are irrevocably committed to a colonial policy.
The European, powers recognize the fact that their

a consistent" policy of severe repression it may yet be

London sends 800,000 children to

square mile of valuable land, distribut

outlay was about $70,000,000, and they
are by far the most important of the

natural to suppose that with so nuuiy
Â»* m \NY and various are the prospects that promise
l\/\ good to San Francisco and to California in the
*Â¦ * * immediate future. Cheering signs of prosperity
arc to.be seen all round the horizon, while only here and
there is any visible portent threatening disaster. Among
all the good omens of the time, however, none is better
than the sanguine spirit which animates our more en
terprising and progressive men. All along the line they
are moving confidently forward to the achievement of
great things for the city and for the people Private
activity was never more vigorous, and all the organiza
tions devoted to public objects are vying, the one with
the other,. for the attainment of the common desire for
a greater and a more beautiful city.
Evidences of the impulses of this sanguine spirit are
to be seen on every l&nd. Three of its' manifestations
are deserving of especial notice, first, the movement for
the display at St. Louis of a special San Francisco ex
hibit on a scale of first-class magnitude; second, the
project for beautifying the city according to a plan to
be devised by men of high ability and experience in such
work; and third, the project for undertaking a universal
exposition in San Francisco in 1913- The three move
ments are widely dissimilar in some respects, but they
accord like different strains of a well ordered harmony.
A successful display at St. Louis, which is the immediate
and pressing work of the present, would greatly aid the
movement for beautifying the city, and that in turn
would rouse the energies of the people to make a rec
ord-breaking exposition nine years from now.
The possibilities of San Francisco are so great in
every direction that it. is inevitable her citizens should
indulge great dreams of future achievement in all de
partments of human endeavor. Her potencies as a com
mercial metropolis* of the vastest of oceans arc not su
perior to those which she possess as a center of art and
of social life.- She may become anything from one of
the world's greatest trading ports \o one, of the most
beautiful and attractive capitals. No other city has such
a climate or such scenery. Were there no city here,
thousands of tourists would visit the peninsula every
summer and every winter to enjoy the picturesque com
bination of ocean and bay, valley and hill, with its cli
mate so genial in winter and so bracing and refreshing
in summer. Dominated as it is by a city of high attain
ment and still higher promise, the peninsula should be
one of the most attractive resorts, of pleasure-seekers on
earth, drawing to its manifold delights visitors from all
parts of the world.
Out of such possibilities there come of course,inces
sant impulses to action. We are feeling such impulses
now more potently perhaps than ever before. We have
strong and public-spirited men to lead us toward the
achievement of much" of our common desire. There is
no reason why we should not loyally co-operate with
those men. Whether they are seeking the immediate
end of a special exhibit at St. Louis or planning: for an
exposition of our own nine years from now, they should
have cordial support. It will not be difficult to attain a
more beautiful San Francisco if we are true to ourselves.
Great things can be done by a people who possess great
self-confidence. It is now time for us to rouse up ,that
confidence. Let us once resolve to have our speciai ex
hibit aLSt. Louis, our great auditorium, our comprehen
sive plan for future improvements, and our campaign
for the exposition in 1913, and doubters will be/; as
tonished to see how easily one of these achievements
will follow the other. The main thing is to make a be
ginning. That is the thing to be done now. ....
An elephant travels on an average
thirty- five miles every twenty-four
hours Â«n search of food. The larger
males never He down on account of

sionally and the young often.
In hunting the elephant, you- soon
come to discover that he has a definite
range of territory to which v he keeps
all his life, unless disturbed and forced
to move on to pastures new.
H is not a very easy, matter to cut
out a ?air of tusks from the head of

worked by lusty arms for Half a d ay .
To reach the under tusk the entire
head must be cut off. . When you have
the time at your disposal it is best to
allow the tusks to remain in the head
until the dentine decomposes, then a
gas will form in the cavity, causing
an exolosion which will send the tusks
some distance from the head.
I came back to camp with a bruised
body and no appetite for supper,
thinking how nearly â¢ that elephant
came to killing me. Of more success
ful hunting I will tell in another arti
cle.
In the darfc bush I could scarcely dis
cern a black mass; there was no dis
tinguishing the head of the animal
from the tail. I approached with a na
tive until he refused to go nearer. There
were two trees Just ahead of us stand
ing close together. I went to them,
thinking I could play hide and seek
with him if he came at me. I cou.ld get
no better shot from here, for even yet
it was impossible to make out head or
tail from what I could see. I ventured
still closer. Bending low I saw two
feet, and to my dismay they were his
front feet. Instantly h!s trunk came
down in front of his feet, then was out
stretched in my direction. He gave the
angry cry of the elephant, so close that
I could feel the hot breath as it was
blown from the proboscis. Then he
charged at me like a fiend incarnate.
The moment I made the discovery that
it was his front feet I was examining
I had instinctively taken several steps
backward, turned and made a dash be
tween the two trees. Just as he made a
grab for me with his proboscis. I don't
know whether he knocked me over or
not. but I fell. The tree checked his
progress for a moment only, but dur
ing that moment by rolling and tum
bling. I was out of sight behind the
bushes a few yards distant. Fortunate
ly my gun had gone off when I fell, and
the smoke, settled down, obscuring
everything, and by the tfme it had
cleared away the elephant had gone off
on a false scent. . -
When I waÂ» within thirty yards of
him I took aim. but the pouring rain
spattered on my gun barrel, making it
difficult to see the sights. I fired; ha
staggered, but kept his feet and
dragged himself into the bush. I could
see a white tusk and aimed at the
place where I knew the head should be.
He reared, almost turning a back
somersault into the river. But some
how, cat like, he landed on his feet in
the water, and started down along the
bank, which was almost on a level with
his back. As he came near me I fired
so close to his head that the powder
must have burnt him. He turned, and
reaching the opposite bank â¢ began
scratching away at its slippery .sides
with his legs all spraddled out like a
big dog trying to climb a picket fence.
Swimming a river with a twenty
pound gun and clothes on would be an
impossibility under ordinary circum
stances, but with the excitement and
the help of a swift current I got across
with only a few gulps of water in the
transit. We were soon after the
wounded elephant, which by this time
was reeling like a drunken man. There
is nothing so perilous as following a
v. cunded elephant in a bush, for should
he charge there is scarce the shadow
of a chance for escape. We had not
gone very far when one of the men
came bouncing back over the trail, his
feet touching only the high places. We
all turned and n>d precipitately, but
found it was a false alarm. Soon we
found ourse!eves in a new herd, and
made reckless by my ill luck of the
morning, I determined to try a fresh
animal.

To quote my journal, November 12,
1 8 !Â¦> S : We are now camped on
VGongu River. I have been followed
here by 200 native men, women and
t-hildren. I arrived last evening and
before 9 o'clock this morning had
killed an elephant; shot him in the
hip. He charged back at me. I jumped
into the river and swam to the other
side. The elephant lumbered in after
me. lost his footing and was drowned
in a stream of water thirty feet wide
and not over nine feet deep. Either
that or the ball took effect, for he bel
lowed like a bull of Bashaa and rear

Ing. The natives tied bush rope to
him and rolled him close to shore,
where they, cut him up, when I found
that the ball had entered the hip and
made its exit through the opposite
shoulder.
.November 13 â We followed a big
bull all forenoon to-day in a driving
rain, only to have him escape into a
swamp after wounding him. We were
on the X'Gongu, eight miles below
camp, and had to cross over to get
back, or else round a great bend in
the river, which would take hours. On
our side of the swollen river was a vast
grass plain, with here and there a
clump of timber. On the other side
with a dense forest. As I stood dread
ing the struggle of crossing, a native
touched me and pointed up stream,
where by the river bank, with his
head in a clump of brush, jvas a big
elephant, picking away at the leaves
and seemingly enjoying his shower
bath.

On Tuesday the subject will be
"Alaska, Through the Fjords to Sitka
and the White Pass." There will be
a special matinee next Saturday, the
subject of which will be "The Yellow
stone."
Siberia will form the topic of Mr.
Holmes' next "travel talk," to be given
to-morrow evening at Lyric Hall, a
subject which at this time should
prove of treat interest, for toward the
Far East and the war cloud there the
eyes of the entire civilized world are
now turned to watch the movements
of Jai>an and Russia. Siberia has al
ways been a land of romance and
mystery, but now that the Trans-Si
berian Railway offers easy and com
paratively speedy access to the East
those days of mystery will vanish. Mr.
Holmes made the journey three sea
sons ago and at that time the rail
road was incomplete, and he there
fore had more opportunities for study
ing the people and their customs in
the journey down the Amur River and
in other breaks in the railway than a
well-to-do tourist of the present day
could obtain.
Two very interesting lectures were
delivered before large audiences by
Burton Holmes yesterday. In the
afternoon he repeated his lecture of
last Tuesday evening on "The Won
ders of the Yosemite Valley," starting
from Merced and describing the most
striking features of this beautiful nat
ural i>ark.
In the evenins for the first time this
season, Mr. Holmes spoke on the
"Grand Canyon of Arizona," This
lecture is a consolidation of his for
mer one on the Grand Canyon and one
on Moki land. It was splendidly il- !
lustrated with stereorticon views and j
moving pictures.

APPOIXTMENT OF DORX
The particular provision of ', the
charter that seems to make. Ragan in
eligible to hold any municipal office is
contained in article 15, section 6 of
the charter, the penalty for violation
of which is forfeiture of office and de
barring the one who violates it from
ever after being ejected, appointed or
employed in the service of the city.
The section follows:
Sec. 6. No Supervisor and no officer or em
ploye of the city and county shall be or be
eonie, direet.lv or indirectly, interested in, or
in tii& performance of, any contract, Â¦work or
busiirfss, or In the sale of any article, the
expense, price cr consideration of which is
payable from the treasury, or in the purchase
or lease of any real estate or other property
belonging to or taken by the city and county,
cr which shall be sold for taxes or assess
ments, or by virtue of legal process at the suit
of ihe city and county. If any person In this
section (leMenated shall durine the time for.
Â¦which he was elected or appointed acquire an
interest In any contract with, or work done
for. the city and county, or any department or
officer thereof, or in any franchise, risrht or
privilege granted by the city and county, un
less the same ehall be de- olved upon him by
law, he shall forfeit his ofilce. and be forever
after debarred arid disqualified from being
elected, ao:)ointed or employed in the service
of the city and ccunty; an-? all euch contracts
Bhall be void and shall hot be enforceable
against the city and couriiy. r
The lot used for a police station on
Stanyan street, between Eage and
Haight, is owned jointly by Ragan,
who is credited with a three-eighths
undivided interest on the Assessor's
books, and ex-Sheriff J. J. McDade,
who owns the remaining five-eighths
of the property. The owners lease the
site for use by the Police Department
for $100 a month. The property way
first leased by Ragan and McDade to
the city in 1898 for Jlf6 a month, but
the rental has since been lowered un
der a resolution of the Supervisors
passed in May, 1901.
The discovery was made yesterday
that under charter provisions D.
F. Ragan, the newly appointed Health
Officer, probably is Ineligible to hold
the position because he leases to_ the
city from month to month certain
property of which he is part owner.
The charter forbids the appointment
to official positions of men interested
in municipal contracts or supplies or
property of the city.
He Leases the Park Police Station to -the

but District Attorney Admits
Evidence Is Insufficient.
â¢ When the case, of William Henry
Bushnell -was called Ir Judge Dunne's
court yesterday to be set for trial As
sistant District Attorney Whiting

Patrick Coyne .was dismissed in
Judge Conlan'3_ court yesterday . on a
charge of battery. He and his wife,*
Bridget, live at 729 Tehama street.
The other . day she' caused his arrest
because she claimed he had hurled a
tea cup at her with such force and
effect as to cut a large gash in one of
her eyebrows. . When the case was
called she was present to .assure the

Like sweet bells jangled but of tune,
a happy matrimonial experience last-'
ing over twenty years is threatened
with a rupture because Mrs. Kate Man
sion refuses to sell her grocery, at 1300
Sanchez street, at the behest of her
husband, John Mansion. The aged
couple have built up quite a prosperous
I business by their united exertions.
| Then the tempter came and whis
pered to the husband visions of wealth
in other lines of industry. He found a,
purchaser for the grocery, but the wife/
with admirable forethought, had the
title of the place in her own name and
refused to become a party to the sale.
Her'husband got out his trusty horse
pistol, which had seen service in the
dark days of the Civil War, loaded- it
up with stove lids 'and ax heads and
told the partner of his joys and sor
rows that he had "come to the.conclu- 4
slon to blow her blooming block off."
She found a policeman who found the.
I husband, . and they all ..found them-;
selves before Judge Cabanlss yesterday.

kill, but in his bent old age he didn't

Two thoroughbred tars were witnesses
in Judge Mogan's court yesterday
against Thomas Turner, another sailor,
who is accused of having tried to re
move with a case knife the vermiform
appendix of another son of the . sea
named Bernard Hansen. Hansen is at
present in St. Mary's Hospital, and it is
believed he will recover.
The cutting occurred at the Sailors'
Home, on Harrison street, and was wit
nessed by ten or twelve persons. .Those
examined so far have v testifled that the
deadly assault was 'entirely without
provocation. The testimony of the sail
ors has been taken so that they may
pursue their ordinary avocations with
out interfering with the ends of justice
by removing to distant parts of the
earth when the charge is heard in the
Superior Court. Further hearing of the
case was continued until January 30 ;
Prosecutor Harris offered the eye in
evidence and the Judge admitted it.
"I would suggest that the eye be
marked by the clerk for identifica
tion," continued Harris. Clerk Duffy
took one Meeting glance at the exhibit
and said, "Not for me; I think the
eye is sufficiently marked now." Mey
ers was convicted of battery and will
be sentenced to-morrow.
Sadie Murphy, a sweet, wild singer
in a. Pacific- street saloon, brought a
badly smoked lamp into Judge Fritz's
court yesterday and told how Charles
Meyers, a piano player in the same re
sort, had. caused the bruise because
she failed to. get in all the minors
while singing "Mona, I'll : Telephone
You." . '
In court yestti day he told Judge
Fritz that while he was in jail. people
kept calling him up by- telephone and
telling- him , they were going to kill
him. -He also complained that several
shots Â» had been taken at him. _.: His
statements in general were so wild
that 4t was concluded to have* him ex
amined on the question of his sanity.
Judge Fritz sent Lester Lewis out
to the Insanity Commissioners yester
day to have his speedway examined
for revolving wheels. Lewis was ar
rested several days, ago on the charge
of petty larceny. While employed as a
clerk for Seymour & Elliott he sur
reptitiously, removed a couple of
wagon loads of lumber from the firm's
yard and dumpedit out in front of- his
mother's house on Mission street. Ap
parently he had no particular use for
the lumber.
Judge Mogan yesterday heard the
case against Edward Richards, who
shot and killed a saloon-keeper on Pa
cific street 'a week ago Wednesday dur
ing a Quarrel over the payment of a
bottle of beer.
Richards came from Visalia and is a
stableman. Delia Hunoldstein, the com
plaining witness, who lived for several
years with the murdered man as his
wife, was the only witness examined.
When she was asked if she had wit
nessed the killing she broke down com
pletely on the stand and pleaded with
defendant's attorney not to compel her
to go over again the events of the trag
edy.
Judge Mogan calmed her with assur
ances that she would be treated with
the fullest consideration, and she fin
ally pulled herself together and man
aged to go through the ordeal of an
examination. She was not a witness to
the actual shooting, being iri the bar

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few People Know How Useful It Is
' .. in Preserving Health and Beauty..
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most \ efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value when taken into
I the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system. ,
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after, eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic. j
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and' throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
I is 'in Stuart's- Absorbent Lozenges; :
they are composed of the finest po w-
'dered willow charcoal and 'other
harmless antiseptics, in tablet form or
rather in the form of large, pleasant
tasting lozenges.' the charcoal being
mixed with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and purer
blood, and the beauty of it Is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, but, on the contrary,
great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal'says: "I advise
Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges to all pa-
tients suffering from gas in stomach
and bowels and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but 25 cents a box at drug
stores, and although in some sense a
patent preparation, yet I 'believe, I get
more and better charcoal in Stuart's
Absorbent Lozenges than in any of the
ordinary charcoal. tablets."

The occasion could be advertised as the open

countries that are looking for trade with the

We have heard a treat deal about what this
city needs, and I am heartily In accord with all
practical civic prog~resÂ«, but it seems better to
work toward a riven end than to string- out our
improvements over an Indefinite period on the
plan of the New City. Hall. It was an old one
before it was finished. Our bonds have been
voted, our Improvements will soon be under
way, and there appears to be no reason why
we cannot have all of this work completed in
time to present to the world a modern city
upon the hills and valleys of San Francisco In
1813. What would stimulate the prosperity of
this State to the extent that an exposition ot
this character would? What> would bring us
the needed railroad transportation quite so
quickly? What would advertise our resources,
develop our possibilities and exploit ' our beau
ties quite so much as the realization of this
euggestion for an exposition to be known as
the Pacific Ocean Exposition?

Blaise. This fact .is positively; known
and is strengthened by the fact that
Cannon was not working and spent his
time frequenting that. part ,'of the Bar

walk. He admitted that he saw Soeder
nearly every I day, -but when _lt ! came
down .to av question of the night on
whlch.Blalse met ; his deaths he hesi
tated, and finally refused to say more, j
tervlew. At first Cannon denied that
he had been. seen by Gibson at .all or
that he knew Soeder, and said he was
in bed all day and did not. get up until
4 o'clock in the afternoon. When he
was told that he was seen at the Hall of
Justice with Detective Gibson identify
ing Soeder yesterday . long before 4
o'clock he admitted that Gibson .had
called on him. "Yes, Gibson was here,"
he said. "I knew Soeder very well. He
was down here i drinking with me for
two nights before the murder took
place. No, I never saw Blaise. He
never was with- Soeder when -Â¦ Soeder
came to the O. K. saloon: The night be
fore the murder | Soeder was here and
we had a bottle, of beer together."

At .the. mention of his name Soeder
stood up. and after casting a haughty
glance at the crowd around him turned
to the magistrate to hear the?reading of
the charge. "You, . Leon ' Soeder,: are
charged with a felony, j to wit, murder."

man by whom they expect to establish
the whereabouts of Leon Soeder on the
night his brother-in-law, Joseph Blaise,
was foully â¢ murdered. That man Is
Frank Cannon, a cook, residing at 521
Pacific street. Cannon was a particu

Joseph Kloess, who was convicted
of grand larcey by a jury in Judge
Lawlor's court, appeared for sen
tence yesterday. The Judge sentenced
him to serve four years in Folsom
penitentiary.
Kloess met Frank Adler. a sailor on
the revenue cutter Thetis, on the
night of October 16. Kloesa was at
tired in the uniform of the navy and
represented that he was assigned to
duty on the Ranger." Adler took him
to hl3 room, as he said he had no
money, and when Adler awakened
next morning Kloess had disapeared,
taking $86 of Adler's money.
It was shown that Kloess deserted
from the navy at Mare Island some
time before meeting Adler and that
he continued to wear the uniform to
enable him to victimize sailors in tho
service of the Government. He hat',
been convicted of petty larceny on a.
former occasion, but at the time ot
his arrest his photograph was not

assessed valuation per year. Surely San Fran
cisco can afford to pay one-tenth of 1 per cent
of its assessed valuation for advertisement
purposes; and what greater advertisement
could eiie have tiian to carry out tte greatest
world s exposition ever attempted?
The proposition to hold a great world's
fair in this city has taken-" firm hold
among the merchants of San Francisco,
and the more the matter is discussed
the more enthusiastic they become. It
is proposed to call it the Pacific Ocean
Exposition, as September, 1913, is the
centennial of the discovery of the Pa
cific Ocean by Balboa.
New suggestions regarding it are be
ing made daily, a very pertinent one
advanced by a prominent merchant to
day beinj? that it be known as the
"Golden City." California is known as
the Golden State, the fair will be helj
in proximity to the Golden Gate and
now it is suggested that the buildings
â¢ be sufficiently tipped with gilding to
Â¦justify the title of the Golden City,
'even as the grounds at St. Louis are
"designated as the White City.
The board of directors has authorized
its secretary to arrange for a confer
ence of the presidents of the various
commercial bodies at an early date. This
' may be the means of bringing the mat
ter officially before all the business men
of the city, so that concerted action
may be taken. In a letter to the Mer
chants' Association .R, B. Hale outlines
the preliminary steps very thoroughly,
lie says: I
To the Directors of the Merchant*' Associa
tion â Gentlemen: Numerous articles have
been published recently on the subject of -what
should be done to beautify and improve Kan
l'rancisco. and us all munk-ii>al improvements
are proper subjects for consideration by this
association, it occurred to me that, in conjunc
tion ' with thÂ« discussion of other important
' matters, it might be well ror us to consider
one Â¦which, to rr.y mind, is of much greater im
portance to this comniunHy than any eo far
suggested.
There are many reasons for bc-lieving that
San Francisco is on th* verge or very great
commercial prosperity. The J-anama canal will
probably be built; trade relations with the
Orient are constantly improving; our steam
ship service has lone b*en inadequate for the
demands of shippers and our foreign posses
sions have entered the eyes of the world upon
Â£aa. Francisco.
TIME IS KIPE.
Is the time not ripe fcr us to consider a
World's Imposition in Eaa Francsco in lDla?
This is looking far ahÂ«ad. but It is better for
turn to build tor the future than tr> repent the
past. After long-continued agitation a cun
â¢ vention finally assemMed in St. Louis on Jaa
oary 10, lÂ£30, at which convention an executive
â¢ committee was appointed which decided on
celebrating the event of the bouitiana Pur
â¢ chase by a great world"s exposition to be held
Jn St. Louis. This was over five years befcre
the date fixed for the exposition. Five years
of active preparation would leave us six years
to develop the interest in a proposition of im
ir.ensa magnitude, ir St. T^ouis ran give an ex
position which will expend in that community
aprrcximatery ?0O.0O0,Â«)O0. why cannot ' Kan
Francisco develop an exposition of even treater
magnitude? St. Louis' population was, ao
I 1 cording: to the census in 1900. S7V-J8. This is
not very much greater than ours at t!>e pres
ent time, and certainly not greater than ours
will be ten years hence. Her bank deposits are
much leas than San Francisco's, and her caDi

; As soon ; as the dead man's relatives
in- Germany can arrange it they will
undoubtedly have the remains disin
terred and buried In a private cemetery
or taken to his home in Germany.
' In the'dead wagon with a number of
the city's, pauper dead,', the body of Jo
seph Blaise was taken to Sunset Ceme
tery, in San Mateo County, and buried
yesterday by JCity Undertaker. Joseph
Hasan of 1703 Sacramento street. Un
dertaker Hagan visited Soeder at the
City Prison before the interment was
made and asked him if he did not want
to. have "the body 'of ' his murdered
brother-in-law Interred in a private
cemetery. Soeder at â¢ first said that he
did; not care what was done with it,
but later told Hagan that he would re
move It from "the potter's field as soon
as he was cleared of the charge now
pending against, him and in a position
to pay. for a' decent burial.
The persistent denials that have
come from the ' police in - their en
deavor to prevent the attorneys . for
the accused man from learning what
evidence they have against. Soeder, so
that they cannot establish his defense,
have been of no avail. -The facts of
the cast as published have been too
conclusive. The poison' found in the
trunk of Blaise was hydrocyanic acid.
Miss Flatley. has made that statement
to the police. Yesterday she was
closeted with Chief Wittman, reciting
again all she knew about Soeder hav
ing in his possession the several bot
tles of poison that were subsequently
discovered by the police. Chief Witt
man says that Miss Catherine Flatley
has been. the most important witness
the police have yet found.
Coroner- Leland has' notified the police
that he is ready to hold the inquest, but
has been asked to delay it until the
police have been able to secure more
evidence against Soeder. The Jury the
v Coroner, has selected is composed of
the following named: Charles Hoover,
lodging-house keeper, 638 Sacramento
street; John Schmidt, saloon-keeper,
G17 Sacramento street;- E.. Blanquie,
restaurant' man, 613 Sacramento street;
Thomas Alexander. . hatter, 424% Mont
gomery street; J. M. Boas, cigar dealer,
4H Montgomery street; , M. G." McClin
ton, printer, 538 Sacramento street; A.
Bach, hop and malt- dealer, 531 Sacra
mento street; J. H. Loring, tinsmith,
527 Sacramento street, and W. J. Mc-
Creery," lodging-house owner, 639 Clay
street. * %.- . ' . .
. City Chemist A. C. Bothe made a par
tial report to Coroner Leland yesterday.
It verified in every way the statement
published in The Call exclusively on
Friday from Dr. Bacigalupi, autopsy
surgeon of the Morgue, fixing the hour
of the death of the murdered man.
Dr. -Bothe's report said: "He could
not have lived longer than an hour or
two after he had eaten his â¢ meal. I
made tests for cyanide of potassium
and chloral, but found no evidence of
poison." - . .
The foregoing quoted report merely
adds to the information already given
as to- the probable hour of ! Joseph
Blaise's death. Dr. Bothe, although
lie could tell approximately how long
the food in the dead man's stomach
had been subjected to the juices of di
gestion, prepared slides of the undi
gested and partly digested food and
with the aid of the microscope firmly
established the space of time that
elapsed between Blaise's last meal and
his death.
Miss Standlee requested an explana
tion from the intruder. She received
no answer. Miss -Eaton then stood
guard while Miss Standlee went to the
dresser and removed her purse and
jewelry. A vigorous demand afterward
was made for the* burglar to come
forth. In a moment he dashed out of
the closet and made a grab for Miss
Eaton. The attack was sudden, but
the girls were equal to the occasion and
responded with their fists. The burglar
soon pleaded for them to retire, stating
that he,. would, depart Immediately.
They ceased doing pugilistic work and
stepped backward. With- a bound he
made'his exit through the open window,
and escaped. ? :. /
o'clock. This , arrangement met with
much objection on the part of the at
tGrneys. -Edward S. Salomon, one of
the attorneys, stated that they were
ready -to Â£c~ on with .the case. â¢ and re
marked that, the police, with the aid of
i he newspapers,, had already convicted
the prisoner. ' He was sharply repri
manded by Judge ; Cabanlss, who told
him that he could not see how the
newspapers had any- connection with
the granting of 'an immediate hearing.
After a great deal of arguing the attor
neys for Soeder acquiesced and Soeder
was led back to his cell.
1)R. BOTIIE MAKES REPORT.
. VENTURA, Jan. 1Câ Miss Carrie
Eaton, manager of the Oxnard office for
the telephone company, and Miss Grace
Standlee came out victorious in a fierce
struggle with a burglar at the Stand
lee residence in Oxnard. The young
and pretty girls demonstrated that
they were not afraid to give battle to
any invader who was after their val
uables.
â¢ No one was in the house but the girls.
The elderly folks had gone out to visit
friends. Early in the evening, while
the young women were in the kitchen,
they, heard a noise. No attention was
paid to it. Later in the evening the
noise was repeated. Then the girls
started on an investigating tour and
found a man in Â»one of the bedroom
closets. Â¦
Special Dispatch to The Call.
This mountain road- is one mile in
length and is the only route from the
lower to the upper valley. It is nar
row, rough and rocky. There are
many sharp curves. It is about 600
feet straight down from the top of the
mountain to the valley below. The
hillside is covered with boulders and
brush. As the animals continued
their race their speed increased and
around the curves they slid. ' Many
times the buggy was on but the two
inner wheels. The occupants desired
to get out, but their traveling speed
was too great. That they kept to the
trail is due to the fact that > the
horses have traveled it many times.
A farmer started up the erade and
saw his peril. He hod barely time to
back his horses and drive off the road.
When within a short distance from
the lower valley the buggy upset.
Slossen and Woodard were pitched
from a precipice and landed in chap
paral. Both were severely cut and
bruised. The vehicle was demolished.
The frightened animals were thrown
into a sycamore tree.
VENTURA. Jan. 16.â A wild *md
dangerously exciting ride down a
steep 'and rocky mountain grade be
hind a runaway team was the experi
ence of Lawrence Slossen and R. J.
Woodard. Slossen is the youngest
son of Superintendent Slossen of Pine
Mountain Reservation. Woodard is
an Ann Arbor College chum of Slossen
and is on a visit to the Ojai Valley.
Early this morning the men secured
a livery team to tour the valley. They
went up the grade to the upper Ojai
Valley, stopping at a rancher's . for
luncheon. After spending a couple of
hours resting they began their home
ward journey. The animals were
lively and inclined to travel at a rapid
pace. When they neared the top$of
the grade the horses became frac
tious. Suddenly they plunged for
ward. Slossen and Woodard were
unable to control them. Down the
mountain grade they started on the
run.

The greyhounds -which possessed
speed had their innings yesterday at
Ingleside Coursing Park, stamina not
being so necessary a quality as it has
been for some months past. The trials
were all good from the spectators'
point of view, without being too severe
a strain on the hounds. The longest
lasted one minute and fifty-two sec
onds.
The bettors who play long shots land
ed sufficiently often to keep in 1 good
cheer. Their best breaks with the tal
ent were when Lady Pinta beat North
ern Alarm; Celtic beat Barefoot Boy,
Fancy Free beat Una, Meddlesome'
beat Maid of the Glen, Red Pepper
beat Young Fearless, Creswick beat
Master Clair, . Flora Belle beat Doc
Burns; Golden Rule beat Reckless Ac
robat and Harlean Gladys beat Red
Rock.
The fifth was a heavy betting event
and a fast run race. Dolly Hayman
was made favorite, but Princess Tu
lane. Chub end M. F. Tarpey were al
most equally well backed. Tulane won
by a length from Cljub, with Tarpey
third. Booker on Chub rode a bad race,
taking his mount back a dozen lengths
behind the leader and keeping him
there to the stretch, when he let him
down. Chub ran over his field and was
closing on Tulane at the -wire. The last
mile was timed 1:40%, which is very
fast for the track. i ;
Silver Fizz was the goods In the last
race and went through without a hitch.
Platonius was second and Dr. Bernavs
third.

Before one of the largest Saturday
gatherings of the season John A. Scott,
a 16 to 1 outsider, owned, by Milton
Jones, a wealthy young turfman of this
city, with "Peanuts" Hildebrand up,
defeated a crack aggregation of sprint
ers - for the rich Adam Andrew selling
stake at Oakland yesterday. Incident
ally he caused the timers to hang out a
new world's record for the distance of
1:18%. Like all events of this sort where
owners do their own handicapping, it
looked a hard guessing proposition, and
John A. Scott Justly, earned his victory
after a furious and exciting three-head
finish with Jockey Club and Dainty.
The winner has always been known as
an inconsistent performer, and this ac
counted for 'the long quotation made
about him. San Nicholas, carrying but
104 1 pounds . and ridden by Foley, was
the favorite, while the Jennings pair,
Dainty and Arcade, had second call.
The odds against Jockey Club fell from
10 to 7. As Frank Reagan thought Dick
Turpin, with his 91 pounds up, had a
Frank : Doss had O'Hagen primed ' for
a killing,", and a carload of money was
wagered on the Â©elding to win the milÂ©
O'HAGEN : WIXS\ HANDILY.
Fresh from the barrier training
school, Garnet . Ferguson's colt Bear
Catcher made his reappearance in the
six-furlong run for three-year-olds. Al
though he had reeled off a mile in
1:40%, 4 to 5 in prof uslon , was laid about
the St. George colt. . Formaster, from
the Boots & Hollenbeck string, cut into
the game for the first time, 1 and his sta
ble.folks thought him oil from the can.
He did well, t even if. Bear Catcher did
gallop in front of him all the way, fin
ishing out the* Journey in â¢1:12%.'. "â¢ H; Li
Frank, away from .the barrier poorly,
ran third;: four, lengths behind Formas
ter. Dr.- Rowell ran a dreary, dull race,
showing no speed, v
Many on this side of the bay figured
that the track would be heavy, but on
the contrary, it was dry and fast.
Favorites decamped with three purses
Willie Sink, who will shortly depart
for sunny France, furnished the fav
orite for the opening sprint over the
futurity course. Willie and his friends
ba,cked St. Winnifride down to 2 to 1
favoritism, and the filly finished third,
after cutting out most of the pace
Quiet, with Hildebrand in - the saddle,
looked a winner half a furlong from
the timers' clock, when Larsen finished
with a* rush on Hainault, getting a
nose decision. The winner was second
choice in the betting.
Prince Brutus made laughing stock
of the kindergarten class in the half
mile scramble for two-year-olds. He
was a 4 to 5 favorite with Jack Martin
on his back, and won In a broad snicker
from Henry Ach. ' The Prince tramped
the distance, in : 48%, with pounds in
reserve. Liberty Star, which ran cou
pled with Golden Idol, finished a good
third.fHBnBHHB9flflH
The winner was conditioned by
Charles B. Lusk and the chestnut
horse's win netted Owner Milt Jones
$3420. 4 â¢.:.Â¦_;..; . ... - ..
TRACK IS DRY AXD FAST.
The start was a good one, with John
A. Scott and his 95 pounds away in the
lead. He was soon Joined by Princess
Titanla and Jockey Club. Princess had
enough after three furlongs, and as the
stretch turn was approached Jockey
Club, though running second to Scott,
looked all over, a winner. As the first
half had been covered in :46%, the six
furlongs in 1:11%, those behind the two
leaders were groggy and staggering.
Hildebrand it seems had been saving
John A. Scott for the final Government
test, and playing his trump card with
the wire almost within reach, passed
the Judges a head in advance of Jockey
Club, astride which Larsen had ridden
a splendid race.
Almost like a spectral figure. Dainty,
with little Kunz on her back, came like
a flash from the bunch and, although
beaten two heads, would have won in
another stride or two. Arcade finished
fourth and the favorite, San Nicholas
fifth. The latter was hemmed in on the
rail almost from the time the barrier
was released.
SCOTT OFF* IX FRONT.
royal chance, the Eastern colt was well
supported.
Although Jack Martin rode two win
ners, Larsen carried off the honors.
Bob Smith's apprentice finished first
on Hainault, O'Hagen and Joe Lesser.
Larsen is modest and well behaved,
and, as his honesty is unquestioned,
his services are in great demand. On
two occasions he nosed out Hildebrand
and has the Yeager jockey hustling to
retain his laurels as the premier light
weight.
Jeddie Lewis was brought up from
Los Angeles by Frank Reagan to ride
Dick Turpin. The colt was outfooted
from the Jump.
Sidney Bender did not forget that
Frank Doss boosted Lord Melbourne
and when O'Hagen won Sidney was
on deck. He carried O'Hagen up
from $500 to $2000, when' Doss quit
bidding and the gelding changed
hands. Bender, it was said, bet
enough on O'Hagen to win him out.
Tommy Griffin, who has been rac
ing some horses at Los Angeles, was a
visitor at the track yesterday. He
liked the looks of things and will proh*
ably bring some horses up "here to
race. Tommy has a clever rider in
E. "Walsh and a shifty two-year-old
that might make Prince Brutus ex
tend himself.
Jockey- John Bullman was suspend
ed yesterday by the Judges at Oakland.
Bullman, it is said, has again fallen
selling affair. Caronal, Kitty Kelly,
Lacy Crawford and Bay "Wonder con
veniently., absented themselves," leaving
O'Hagen a 6 to 5 chance. Larsen. rode
the Doss entry, and after waiting upon
Harry Thatcher and Gawalne to the
stretch moved along leisurely and was
returned the easiest sort of a winner.
Gawalne outgamed Harry Thatcher,
taking place honors by almost a length.
Tom Slavin, the second choice, with
"Don't-ring-the" Bell up,- wheeled and
did not get away.
Seven faced the webbing In the mile
and a sixteenth handicap, and Incu
bator was installed favorite, with 105
pounds to negotiate. Incubator was
quite a horse about Chicago, but Windy
City form Is at a discount here. Ben
MacDhui, a 10 to 1 shot, piloted by Hil
debrand, made. all the running and at
the close only lost to Joe Lesser by a
nose In 1:46. Incubator ran into the
show. ::-.>Â¦'

Catarrh begins with a stubborn cold in the head, inflammation or sore-
ness of the membrane or lining of the nose, discharge of mucus matter,
headaches, neuralgia and difficult breathing, and even in this early stage
is almost intolerable. But when the filthy secretions begin to drop back
into the throat and stomach, and the blood becomes polluted and the
system contaminated 1; '

disease and as inhaling mixtures, salves, ointments, etc., are never more
than palliative or helpful, even in the beginning of Catarrh, what can

TO ARPvIVE.
Everybody within striking distance of
the? Presidio forgot their troubles yes
terday afternoon and Â¦wandered over to
the athletic grounds^to witness what
proved to be the best amateur tall
game that has been decided in this city
for many a moon. The Presidio <eam.
under the wir.g of Joe "vÂ»"a=mer. handed
it to Hapry Hogan's San Jose tossers
2 to L
Although Ute grounds were wet and
sloppy it did not make fast *ork an
unknown quality for the rlayers. Nor
did the crowd seem to ir.ir.d the cold or
the mud. for locg before the hour of
starting had arrived fully 1000 ardent
soldiers, officers, citizens and fair maids
were en the srot to root for the lads in
blue.
The game opened with the country
lads at the bat. and they started in to
runch out a tally without further cere
mony. Then they stopped, and never
again throughout the battle could they
squeeze another man over the rubber.
The pitching of Forsyth was the real
rream cheese, and the kind that gener
ally wins ball games."
The soldier lads got a start in the
second. Then they created a deadlock
that lasted for six round?, and won in
th? ninth spasm rv-ith two men out. Left
Fielder Lamb was th*Â» lad who came
thrcugh with the bingle that brought
home the victory, and for acting so no
bly he was immortalized for a while.
The pitching of Emerson and For
pyth was a!>out the best amateur work
that any fan would like to gaze upon.
Roth lads had everything and never
l<-*st their heads in the tight places. For
syth had the better of the argument on
point*, for he was the steadier and
v.f-ver allowed an opposing batsman to
v aik as fr.r as first. Emerson had won
cerful spred and struck out eleven men.
The ?Â¦:Â» Mk-rs bunched their hits on him
in two innings, and in the fifth would
!'avÂ« won out but for bad coaching.
Chase, the third man un for San Jose
in the first inning, lined out a single
and then nilfered second. The soldier
iads then anxious and tried to
c&teh him off j*econd. In the attempt
Conrad threw the ball sway out to
Â¦ enter field and Chase came in with
the only tally for the country boys.
The soldiers landed in the second.
Conrad got a raÂ»< in the slats, took s?c
â¢ nd on a wild pitch and scored on
Kent's bad threw to catch him nap
;ir.|r. Then all was serene till â¢"Teeley"
Raymond opened ui> the ninth for the
sWdhTS v. ith m drive over short. For
Â¦-Â¦vth's out f>u> him on second, and a
rrroment latr r Lamb walloped the leath
er out to dec? center field and Ilay

The California Tennis Club courts
did not dry yesterday until the middle
of the afternoon, and some of the play
ers could not be accommodated. The
i feature was a doubles between Joe To
; bin and Will Taylor and Herbert
Schmidt and Harry Rolfe. The veter
ans have yet to meet their first defeat.
They lost the first set to the promising:
youngsters, but changed their tactics in
the next two sets and won with some
thing to spare.
Schmidt and Rolfe played a fine game
in the opening set, and their opponents"
lobbing game just suited them. In the
second and third sets Tobin and Taylor
used more speed in the back court and
took the net whenever they had a
chance. Schmidt and Rolfe were put
on the defensive and fell easy prey to
their more experienced ooponents. Tay
lor was steadier than Tobln, but the
latter won .many more aces. Rolfe
played his usual steady game, but
Schmidt in the last two sets was rather
wild. Taylor and Tobin have beaten ;
every good team except MacGavin and j
Allen. If they beat the latter a' match :
will probably be arranged for them
with MacGavin and Smith. :
! After an absence of severaj weeks Dr.
McChesney, who has been in the snow
bound East, took up his racket and was
almost as clever as ever. After losing
the first set he won the next two from
Chester Smith.
Herbert Long and Gus Taylor played
a close three-set match. Taylor won the
first, but the next two, which were ex
tremely close, went to Long. The win
ner did some fine driving, both back
and fore hand. Taylor was somewhat
out of practice.
Dr. Lovegrove was at his best yester
day when he beat Harold Gabriel and
t!ed Robert Drolla. The doctor also
beat A. Mannon.
Bradley Wallace and Glenn Cogwill
played a long match, in which the hon
ors were even. Each won two sets. The
score in the fifth was 3 â 3 when dark
ness set in.
The following matches were played:
Harold Gabriel tied R. B. Daggett, 6-4, 2-6,
1-6. 6-1; Glenn Coswlll tied Bradley Wallace.
6-0, 4-6. 1-6, Â«-0, 3-3; Herbert Long beÂ»t Gus
Taylor. 4-6. 7-5 6-4; I>r. Lovegrove beat A.
Mannon, 6-4. 6-2. 6-3; Will Taylor and J. S.
Tobln beat H. A. Schmidt and H. H. Rolfe.
3-6. 6-4. Â«-3; Dr. McChesney beat C J- Smith.
2-6, 6-4. Â«-3; T. A. Allan beat C. P. Prltchard.
6-4, 6-3; Dr. Lovegrove beat Gabriel, 6-3 and
tied R. Dro'.la, 1-6. 6-1.
The Golden" Gate Tennis Club will
finish its doubles tournament to-day, if
the courts dry in time.
A special match has been arranged
between Herbert Schmidt and Clarence
Griffin, to be played at the California
Club courts this afternoon at 2 o'clock.
It will be three sets out of five. Schmidt
Is easily the most promising young
player of the California Cfub and re
cently won the second class without
losing a set. Griffin occupies the same
position at the park, and the match
will surely be a good one. The Califor
nia Club members are confident that
Schmidt can take Griffin's measure,
while the members of the Golden Gate
Club are equally sure Griffin will win.

'Will you" not sit .down?* a man said
to me and I realized I was shaking vio
lently. 'No, thank you.' I knew I did
not feel faint. I decided to go down
the street to Carrie's hotel, about four
blocks away. I felt surprised to 'find
my overshoes had been pulled off my
feet. As I started I saw the, engines
playing into the building and for the
first time realized that there might be
danger from the flre as well as from
the, crowd. I hurried on, meeting per
sons who were lightly walking toward
the scene of horror that they had no
idea of and of the extent of which no
one dreamed then.
"Carrie and I were saved. But 591
persons who had been sitting there
twenty minutes before enjoying^ the

of those who entered between those

a letter came from one Ed Zimmerman,

"A young girl was beside me, Just
one farther in than I, yet she could not
reach the door, to which I was car
ried. 'Oh!' she cried, in great smoth
ering gasps, 'Oh! oh!' and called some
name. I knew her soft body was be
ing crushed against the -stone door-
Jamb^ With all my force I-* tried to
sway my body away, from hers to
spare her, but I was brushed on. /Oh,
stop!' came- another cry of agony,
'there is a child down here!'
Â¦ ". "I felt numb, and the words did not
bring clear meaning | to me. " Even
tighter pressed the crowd, and I
vaguely felt that I could not endure
much greater pressure. Yet my mind
was very quiet, containing few
thoughts, but with a calm feeling:; of
safety. Then my feet touch'ed some
thing soft; I stepped upon some yield
ing thing â it could not have been very
large nor high; I .was soon; over. it.
The last words I had heard rushed
over me with their full/ awful signifi
canceâ-It was the childâ the childâ It
must have been the 'child." -:
â¢ "And I had put my feet upon It â I
could not -'stop to lift; it up. Never

"Had the three doors been open we
could all have passed across the foyer
and out through the entrance Into the
street. The middle door was open, the
other TWO WERE LOCKED. All the
surging mass directed its steps toward
that middle door. Carrie and I were sep
arated. Now we could hear screams be
hind us, yet I felt that I should have
expected more noise. I did not expect
that any one would be seriously hurt
and thought Â£he fire would soon be out.
Tighter pressed the crowd, and I was
borne along.
YOUXG GIRIi IiOST.
SLOW TO START.
" 'Come,' said Carrie, 'we will go
now.' *Xo,' I answered, 'let us wait.'
I felt very quiet, and dreaded the panic
more than the flames. But Carrie said,
with great' emphasis, 'No, come now,'
and I delayed no longer. Through it
all I felt sure of my ultimate safety,
but as I started to move along the
crowded space toward the one exit, a
little thrill of excitement swept through
me and was gone. I held. my coat in
my hands and carefully lifted my skirts
to my knees, as I had read it was safe
to do in a mob to prevent being tripped
over and being: trampled on. Everyone
how seemed to be moving toward that
door, but there was little noise. At that
moment it was not more crowded 'than
when leaving the theater under ordin
ary circumstances. I saw one woman
climb over the back of the seats and
fall to the floor. No one could pause
to help her up. Safely, but in a tight
ening crowd, we passed out through
that side entrance door Into the foyer.
Carrie was with me. There were three
doors leading out of this foyer into the
outer entrance, where tickets were sold.
"Suddenly there was absolute quiet â
no sound of music, no sound of sing
ing, co movement on the stage nor In
the audience, but a terribje awe-In
spiring silence. Silence for just a mo
ment. Then a voice, seemingly from
behind the scenes, cried out one word
âfire. There was ' a murmur every
where â murmur of low voices and of
moving bodiesâ the music began, half
the chorus remained on the stage awk
wardly trying to dance. A bright,
flickering light could be seen at the
left side of the wings and little burn
ing sparks fell to the stage. A woman
down the aisle fainted. Eddie Foy
(Mr. Bluebeard) came to the front with
outstretched arms. 'There is no dan
ger,' he cried. 'Keep your seats, sit
down, it will be "out in a minute.'
Voices in the audience shouted, 'Keep
down; keep your seats.! Â«
"Carrie and I stood perfectly still. I
did not feel inclined to move, nor did
I feel fear. 'We will keep, still,' she
said; 'it will soon be out. I have seen
such things before.' 'Yes,' was all I
replied. 'There is no danger,' called the
voice from the stage. Then down came
a blazing piece of the burning canvas
and floated into the first rows of Â» the
audience. And another, and othersâ'
pieces two feet in diameter. I thought
I saw a movement as if there was an
attempt to lower a curtain, but that
was only at the. top of the stage, the
curtain did not fall to shut out the
flames.
THERE CAME A SILENCE.
"The curtain rose for the second act.
Mr. Bluebeard had Just left the stage,
leaving an;amusing memory of yowl
ing cats and barking dogs, and a
chorus of perhaps thirty\ girls were
singing. The stage was a beautiful
woodland scene, graceful foliage hang
ing everywhere.
"The first act was drawing to a close;
about two hundred persons were on the
stage; girls in tights and airy costumes,
seme drawn Â«up and clown by wires
seemed to float in the air; the scenery
wes gorgeous and the curtain fell upon
a beautiful picture. An actor, Scott
Craven, Joined U3 and. as hs and Carrie
talked I looked over the audience.
What ti beautiful scene! It was com
posed mostly of young girls, children
and women. I particularly noted a
party of girls, about fourteen, dresse5
In light dresses, with pretty bright hair
ribbons, sitting in the third or fourth
row from the stage. There were smaller
misses, with fluffy skirts, and little
brothers, opening baby eyes upon the
wonders of fairy land. I felt a warm
â¢wave of sympathetic pleasure.
. The following powerful description of
the awful tragedy at the Iroquois The
ater, Chicago, was written in the form
of Â«r letter. The author, Mrs. Felicia
B. Rees, of 5548 Ellis avenue. Chicago,
was formerly a San Franciscan and
the letter was addressed to friends in
this city:
"When Carrie and I reached the Iro
quois Theater she joined the Ions line
of those buying tickets and finally se r

scats and finding that space well

and the wall, finding a small space in
which to stand, leaning against the
back of the seats about two-thirds, of
the way across the theater, away from
the entrance.
"Still I held my arms out to him, and
I smiled a little. 'I can't keep back,' I
said. He smiled,' too, at me anJ too':

quietly outside. It was bitterly cold,

wrap. I stood leaning against the
building; women passed me, coming
out, but I did not. look in. One woman
stood there with her white hair hang
ing in a loose mass, down her back.
Some chorus girls passed by. They
wore their thin silk tights. Some had i
thrown around them some hastily
caught up drapery; their faces look
ed strajigely painted in the daylight.
I thought they must be very cold.

were arriving and I started across the

about 10 years old; she was crying, I
stooped to put an arm around her.
.'Don't cry, dear; she is out all safe." I I

the emptiness of my words, still in a

Truly, the most intimate life of na
tions which flourished many thousands
of years asov rises gradually from its
long entombment through the extra
ordinary results of recent excava
tions. Here is a report of the French
Archaeological Institute at Cairo
dealing with' the researches of a
learned priest, Vincent Scheil. In the
little Babylonian town of Sippara,
which in distinction' from similarly
named places was called the "Sippara
of the Plain," or "of the Sun," and
which was surrounded by a number
of suburbs, he has discovered a per
fect schoolroom for pupils of the more
learned class, together with the ma
terials for writing and instruction. ).It
transports us back to. upward of 4000
years before our time! :

brevation of "Thesauri Americae Sep
tentrionalis Sigillum." The Congress of
the Confederation granted a charter to
Robert Morris for the "Bank of North
America," and the same authority au
thorized the establishment of a "mint
of North America," both of these terms
most likely originating with Robert
Morris, who subsequently was a mem
ber of the committee to prepare a seal
for the treasury and navy.
ROBERT MORRIS' COXXECTIOX.
It is therefore highly probable
that Robert Morris furnished the
legend for the seal of the treas
ury, which would explain the
employment of the term "North Ameri
ca." The reason for using this term
was probably owing to the fact that the
fathers of the republic confidently ex
pected that Canada would ultimately
become a part of the sovereignty and
be included in the independent colonies.
In. 1774 the popular Legislature of
Canada was abolished by act of Parlia
ment, and royal officers appointed to
make laws for the province, except
laws to raise taxes. This gave the Brit
ish Government a firm hold on Canada.
Efforts were made in 1775, during the
revolution, to regain possession of Can
ada, but those efforts failed.
In 1849 Edward Stabler <Jf Sandy
Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland,
one of the most famous die sinkers and
seal engravers of his time, was com
missioned to make a fac simile of the
original treasury seal, which was worn
from constant use, and failed to make
good impressions. Mr. Stabler suggest
ed some minor changes in the way of
improvement, .'but was Instructed to
copy the design exactly as It was, and
"in accordance with law." Diligent ef
forts have failed to discover any law
on the subject.
In recuttlng the seal It has been de
termined by Secretary Shaw that as the
great seal has always been, so shall It
remain, of course, unless Congress
should direct otherwise. As one ofllcial
remarked: "The United States may
own the earth one of these days- then
will be time enough to make the
change. âWashington Star.
That the early fathers of this country
expected the United States c*f America
to embrace the entire North American
continent is called to mind by the fact
that in the recent placing of an order
to recut the great seal' of thÂ«^ United
States treasury the question arose as
to the legend or motto it hss always

EAELY FATHERS'
A3IBITI0US IDEAS
The history of the seal and of its
adoption is not entirely clear. "Sep
tember 26, 1778, the Continental Con
gress resolved that a committee of
three be appointed to prepare a seal
for- the treasury and the navy." The
committee chosen In pursuance of that
resolution consisted of Messrs. Wither
spoon, Robert Morris and R. H. Lee.
At that time the treasury was under
the jurisdiction of the committee on
finance, or board of the treasury, and
the navy was under the board of ad
miralty. The committee made a report
on recommending a device for the navy,
but there is no record of a report hav
ing been made for the treasury. A
seal for the treasury. However, was
adopted, impressions of which are
found on original papers in the files of
the register . of the treasury. Some
minor changes have been made from
time to time in this seal, but the seal
now in use is substantially the same
as that originally adopted.
The legend on the seal is "Thesaur.
Amer. Septent. Sigil.," which Is an ab-
HISTORY OF THE SEAL.
The Query has often been asked why
this legend is not inscribed "seal of the
treasury of the United States <>f Amer
ica." What is known as the "great
seal" of the treasury of the United
States, a fac-simile of which appears
on all the circulating notes and other
pecuniary obligations of th2 Govern
ment, is a frequent subject of inquiry
on the part of the people of an in
vestigating turn of mind, the legend,
which literally is "seal ur the treasury
of North America," suggesting an es
pecial subject of inquiry. Why the seal
should be that of the treasury of North
America is especially puzzling to al
most every person familiar with the
literal, significance of the legend.
borne, and whether or not it should
be changed to what is actually the
truth, or whether it should .be allowed
to remain as it has always been. It
will not be changed.
The legend or motto imprinted upon
United States bonds, treasury notes,
etc.. reads: "Thesaur. Amer. Septent,
Sigil.," signifying "Seal of the Treas
ury of North America."
layer, however, was d.ug through
pieces of walla and remnants of
houses and public edifices appeared.
At the request of the Turkish Gov
ernment P. Vincent Scheil has laid
bare a whole ward of the town/and
from it a full insight into the life of
the inhabitants can be gathered. The
school was found in a little house op
posite a temple.. Little clay tablets
and statuettes lay about in it. On
one of the tablets was the inscription:
"He who distinguishes himself in the
School of Writing will shine even as
the sun."
The walls were three meters high.
The house contained seven rooms; in
one of them a vast mass of clay tab
lets were set in regular order. Many
of them had not yet been baked, so
that they stuck together and their in
scriptions had become undecipherable,
other tablets, however, proved
to be intact, and they contained
hymns in the oldest Sumerian â that
is, pre-Semitlc, Turanian â language
of Babylonia; meteorological lists,
primers, dictionaries, arithmetical
problems, contracts and so forth.
Some had served as copybooks,
which was clearly visible from the
firmness and beautiful clearness of the
letters. They were used for exer
cises in the class. On several of the
tablets it could still be seen how the
pupils had scratched out some faulty
writing, smoothing the clay over again
with the stylus made of wood, bone
or copper.
All the dated texts bear the name of
King Hammurabi, about whom the
recent controversy between Professor
Delitsch and the Emperor William II
arose. So the school is known to have
been used about twenty-one centuries
ago.
The cuneiform writing must have
presented . great- difficulties to ' the
learners. As to **the grammar, "'de
clensions, conjugations, little sen
tences referring to prayers, forms of
greeting, expressions of sympathy, ju
dicial and business phrases, also
arithmetical and geometrical tasks,
the nomenclature of measures and
weights, and so forth, are contained
in beautifully inscribed tablets.

Very appetizing will be the next picture presented to Sunday Call g

the eminent French artist, Louis dc Scbryver. Â»
The composition is a delight in it* originality and appetizing charac- o

onlooker by some loving hand, the portrayal being .absolute in its realism.
One feels nlmost like picking up the berries individually and putting them
fa the mouth, so true to nature are they pictured. tf
De Sehryver has surpassed himself in this particular canvas. He is . S

: A very curious lawsuit is announced
for hearing shortly before the court of
Rome. Olinto Spadohi, who is well
known to all English speaking tourists
in Rome, is bringing an action against
Father Ludovic Martin, general of the
Jesuits, claiming $4000, besides costs
and other expenses, for work said to
have been done by him under instruc
tions from Martin. Spadoni . says, that
in 1898, when Americanism, seemed
about to create a schism in the Catho
lic.; church in the United States, he,
being: already proprietor and Â«ditor of
a weekly paper, the Roman Herald,
proposed to Father Martin the foun
dation of a new organ, which appear
ed for some time under the title of
the True Catholic American.. The pa
per, was sent to the States in thousands
and Spadohi says that all this was
done under the guidance of Father
Martin. He ' attributes, however, . to
himself and the influence of his paper
most of the. merit for bringing .about
a reconciliation of the Catholic fac
tions in America, ending with Arch
bishop Ireland's submission. Spadoni
asked for compensation, but having as
yet received nothing, has recourse "to
the law courts.â^New York Commer

Systems of shop-cost keeping, says
Cassier's Magazine, have been so much
harped upon, both in. pap.?rs before
technical societies and 'in technical pe
riodicals, that it wjjuld seem as though
pretty nearly everything had been said
and printed about them that could be
thought of, and in very many instances
the or:!y result has been a waste of
time and printer's ink. "vVhon a sys
tem of any kind require? sov?ral addi

"tiood evening, miss," said this mod
ern Dick Tur;>i2i when he met Miss
Jouilientl on the Santa Fe Railroad
trat ks a quarter of a block from her
homo at U:30 o'clock last night. kHe
bowed and scraped and lifted his hat
so many .times that Miss Jouillerat
thought he was only going to ask the
way to Oakland. ' i She hesitated a mo
ment before passing 1 on and he inter
cepted her.
BEGS VICTIM'S PARDON.
"I humbly beg your pardon, miss,
butâ"
And he sut one of his hands over
her mouth and the other in her left !
hand.'
"I will trouble you for whatever
money you happen to have about your
person. I am .indeed sorry to trouble
you thus, but my poverty compels me :
to do so."
As Miss Jouillerat did not betray any
disposition to- scream Dick finally un
covered her mouth arid devoted him
self to a search for valuables. He ran
his hands over her lingers In the hope
of running across some rings. Then
he rummaged around her purse, but
all he could find was 40 cents.
"I wish I had something wKh which
to hit you,'' said Miss Jouillerat, while
,she was submitting to Dick's scrutiny.
"Xo doubt you would, miss," he re
plied, "but I have taken the necessary
precautions, you see."
Dick referred to Miss Joulllerat's um
brella. ' He had confiscated it^in the
belief that she would belabor him with*
it if the chance offered. In the inter
val it had fallen to the ground.
"That is about all this evening,"
said Dick at last. "You may go now.
Here's your umbrella."
It was then that he unburdened
himself of that facetious remark as
to the "bumness" of the hold up.
"I will escort you home if you
wish," urced Dick.
"No, thank you; I can ro . home
alone," replied his victim. â¢
THREATENS TO SHOOT.
"Well, then, hurry up. And be
careful not to make any noise, because
I'll, shoot."
I Miss Jouillerat did hurry home, but
she did not tell the police about It.
She wasn't scared enough for that.
"I wasn't frightened a bit," said
Miss Jouillerat to-day. "I was going
to scream at first, but after the first
shock I became more philosophical. I
felt that if I attempted to resist ' I
would get the worst of it, and as I had
nothing to lose there was nothing to
gain by fighting. He was certainly a
very courteous highwayman."
Miss Jouillerat was returning: from
practice with the choir, of the Tenth
avenue Baptist Church in East: Oak
land, where she Is a soloist, .when she
met the .highwayman. She did not
get a good look at his face, as hi3 back
was against, the light coming from an
electric arc standing 1 where the Santa
Fe tmcks and Sixty-first street cross.
But she thinks she N heard : enough*;bi
his. voice to enable her to recognixe it
should she hear it again. The man
wore a short light overcoat, black
Fedora hat and seemed about 5 feet 7
inches 'n height. . .
Miss Jouillerat Is 23 years old and the
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Adolph A.
Jouillerat of Sixtr-flrst street.
This highwayman had all the gen
erosity and gallantry and "fconcelt of
his prototype, die famous, or Infa
mous, Dick Turpin. No pistols, no
threats, no harsh words, only good
planners; It was "Please, miss, allow
me"; "I beg your pardon," and so on
all the way through. It was such a
pleasant experience that Miss Juillerat
wouldn't nund meeting that highway
man acaji'i.
BERKELEY, Jan. 16. â Mi?s Flor
inne Jouillerat at 964 Sixty-first street
knows what it is to come face to face
with that rare species, a nice, polite,
well-bred highwayman â polite and at
the sam.e time witty. She met the
gentleman last night and he robbed
her â of 40 cents. They were a bitter
disappointment â those three . dimes
and two nickles â but he didn't forget
his cheerfulness nor breeding: for a
minute. Oh, no; he just picked up
.the young woman's umbrella and with
Chesterfieldlan grace handed It back
to her, rounding out the action with
this keen bit of humor:
"Well, miss, this is a bum hold-up,
isn't it?"

The Judge had had his patience sore
ly tried by lawyers who wished to talk
and by men who tried to evade Jury
service. Between hypothetical ques
tions and excuses It seemed as if they
never would get to the actual trial of
the case. So when the puzzled little
German who had been accepted by both
sides jumped up, tho Judge was exas
perated.
*"rin,udge!" cried the German.
""What Is it'."* demanded the Judge.
*"l tink I like to go home to my vife,"
?aid the German.
"You can't," retorted the Judge. "Sit
dov.n!"
s "But. Sliudge," persisted the German.
"I don't tink I make a good shuror."
. "You're the btst in the box." said
the Judge. ~Elt down."
"What box?" asked the German.
'The Jury box," said the Judge.
"Oh, I tqnyht it vaa a bad box that
peoples gfcts in somedimes."
"No." said the Judge, "the bad box
Is the r>vl3>~.ner's box."
"Ti'zt. .h-j.ijre," persisted the little

CHICAGO, Jan. 10. âWheat ruled strong on
an active demand from ehorts. While the do
mestic news was in the main apparently bear
ieh. the war situation wÂ«,a Still threatening.
It was thio that started the covering by short*.
as it was considered possible that war might
be declared before trading: was resumed on
Monday. The opening- was about where the
market left oft the. day before, with May at
S7>4@s7%e. Coarse grains were showing con
siderable strength, and this lact Induced some
buying of wheat early, which advanced the
price of May to 87HCS8C. The market re
ceded again, however, on pront taking influ
enced In eome degree by report* of moisture
in California. I-ater In the day advices from
Kansas City stated that reports of damage
to the winter wheat crop by drought in ths
Southwest were becoming more general. This
was sutnclent to cause another buying move
ment from shorts. Offerings were of such a
lit;lit character that before the demand could
be satisfied May had been hoisted to &>%c.
The market closed strong, with prices about the
high mark, final figures on May being at S8-""*Â©
eVfiC.
Corn wÂ»b excited, and the trade at times
assumed large propcrtions. . May opened l 4c
to Uc higher at 4uÂ®40VsC, cased oft to 4fc%@
48*$ c. and then advanced rapidly to 49%c,
closing at 49U$f49bc. â¢
.A resumption of bull tactics by leading longs
caused a strong market In oats. Alter open
ing a shade lower to He higher at 41V6C. to
41%Â©41Â»4C. May sold between -41Vic and
42>-ic, closing at â¢tl> / i<&41Â«ic.
Interesting gra;n markets, attracted traders
from the i.rovieion pit, and trading was only
of small \olume. with mtst of.lt for local ac
count. The strength in grain h:ld provisions
prices steady. May pork closing a shade higher

' ".:, ' â¢ ;>Â¦ CASE UNTIL MONDAY
â¢ This brings" to a close what was at
one- time believed would be a bitterly
contested case and pro'yide some sen
sational testimony. Previous to the
filing of the complaint, Mrs. Ayers had
talked of bringing the action, and the
husband brought one first. There are
a number of specific cruelties men
tioned, the most 'sensational -of- which
was that the defendant attacked plain
tiff at their home in SebastopoMn 1900.
and without any provocation' struck
him across the head with a heavy iron
spoon fifteen Inches in length, breaking
the crown of his hat and inflicting a
scalp wound. Plaintiff asserts that
at the time of the " attack he was
peaceably reading a newspaper and
had no warning of the onslaught.
The case attracted considerable at
tention at the time of the filing of the
suit, owing to the social prominence
of the couple. The plaintiff is a well
known Sonoma County educator, . hav-"
ing taught in a number of the county's
schools, and enjoys an extensive - ac
quaintance. His wife was; a society
belle of this city previous to : , the mar
riage, the daughter of wealthy parents
and a girl of beauty and charm of
manner. .__
the lips of the accused there come no
denials."
