Â»* Â»T-dear fellow,'.' said Sherlock
f A /I - Holmes, as we sat on either side
I" lof the fire in his lodgings at
â¢ I Baker street; "life . Is \u25a0. infinitely
stranger than anything ; which
the mind of man could Invent, We would
not Aare to conceive the things â¢which are
really mere commonplaces of existence. . If:
we could fly out of that window hand In,
hand, hover over this great city, gently
remove the roofs, and peep in at the
queer things which are â¢ going ' on, * the â¢
ctrange coincidences,' the ; plannings, the
cross-purposes. thÂ« wonderful chain of :
e\*ents, working through generations, \u25a0 and
leading; to the most' outre ' results, 'It
would make all fiction' with its; conven
tionalities and foreseen conclusions most
stale and unprofitable." :
"And yet I am not^ convinced of It," I
answered. "The cases which" come to
light In the papers are. as a rule.' bald
enough and vulgar enough.' "We have in
our police realism pushed to its extreme
limit*, and yet the result is. It must be
confessed, .neither fascinating nor

"A certafcryselectlon and discretion must
be used iHSwroduclnfi 1 a realistic effect."
remarked HFolmes. "This is wanting in
the police^wÂ»rk, where more stress is laid
perhaps' upon the platitudes 6f the magis
trate than upon the details, which to an
observer contain the vital essence of the
whole matter. Depend upon it there is
tto'Jhing so unnatural as the common
â¢ ~^Â£ce."
-Â»! emlled and shook my. head. "I can
quite understand youthlnklng so,", said I.
"Of course, in your position of unofficial
adviser and helper to everybody" who .is
absolutely puzzled, throughout three con

all that is strange and bizarre. But
here"â l picked up the morning paper \u25a0
from the groundâ "let iis put It to a prac

which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to

print, but I know without. reading it that
it Is a.n perfectly familiar, to me. There
Is. of course, the other woman, the drink,

Holland, though the matter in which I
served them was of such delicacy that I
cannot - confide it even to you, who "Rave
been good enough to chronicle one or two
of my little problems."
"And have you any on hand just now.?"
I asked, with interest.
"Some ten or. twelve,' but none. which
present any feature of Interest. They are
Important, you understand, without being
Interesting. . Indeed. I have found that it
is usually in i unimportant matters that
there is a- field for the observation and
for the quick analysis of cause and ef
fect which gives the charm to an investi
gation. The larger crimes are apt to be
the elmDler. for the bigger, the" crime the
mere obvious, as a rule, ,is the motive.
In these cases, save* for . one rather In
tricate matter which has" been referred to
me from .Marseilles, there is nothing
trhlch presents any features of ; interest.

something better before, very many mln

lit had " risen - from his chair and was
standing between the parted blinds, gaz

2<cn(3on street. Looking over his houlder,
I saw that on the pavement opooslte
there stood a large woman with a heavy
fur boa around her neck, and a large
curling red feather in a broad-brimmed
hat which was . tilted in a coquettish
Duchess-of-Devonshire fashion over her .

peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion
at our windows, while her body oscillated
backward and . forward, and her fingers
fidgeted with her glove buttons.. Sud
denly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer.

the; road, and we heard the sharp clang
of the belL. /
"I have seen those symptoms before,",
said; Holmes, throwing his cigarette into
the fire, v "Oscillation upon the pavement
always "means an affaire ce'eoeur. She
would like . advice, but is not sure that \u25a0
the matter is not too delicate for. com
munication. And yet even ; here we may
discriminate. - When 'a woman has; been
seriously wronged by a man she no longer
oscillates, and the usual" symptom is a'
broken bell "wire. Here we may. take It
that- there is a love matter, but that the
maiden is not -.so much angTy as per
rlexed, or grieved. But- here >he comes
in person to resolve our doubts." '
As he spoke there was a tap at the door
and the boy \in buttons entered : to an

lady hcrwlf loomed behind ' his -small

that it was Quite right to make me

said she would make It all right with

Holmes. It seemed funny that I should
ask his leave, at hs was -only a few
years older than me; but I didn't want
to do ''anything on the sly, so I wrote
to father at Bordeaux, where the com

"Ha! that- was '^unfortunate. Tour
wedding was arranged, then, for Fri
day. "Was it to be in church?"
"Yes, sir, but. very quietly. It was to
be at' St. Savior's, near King's Cross.
and we were to have breakfast after
ward at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer
'came for. us in a hansom, but as there
'were two of us he put 3 'ua both into
it "and ; stepped himself ' Into a four
wheeler, which happened to be the only
â¢other cab in the street. We got to the
church first and when the four-wheeler
drove up we waited for him to step
out, .but he. never did. and when the
cabman got down from the box and
looked there was no one there!. The
cabman' said that he could not imagine
what had become of him, - for he, had
seen ", him get in ; with his . own . eyes.
That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes,' and
I never have seen or. heard anything since
; then to Â« throw - any light upon ' what be
came of him.'.' ' .
"It - seems .to .me ; that you have been
- very < shamefully . treated," said Holmes.
"'."Oh no. sir! He r was. too good and kind

ACCIDENTS ARE DUE TO
GROSS CARELESSNESS
(Copyright. 1305. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
*% *r INE-TENTHS of the untoward
/\ J' happenings that people call acci-
I dental are due to gross careless-
V. * ness and shameful ucglcct. .
There are two sets, of people 5n
the worldâ those who keep things up and
thOEe who let things run down. The first
have never indulged In the habit of put
ting off till to-morrow what ought to be
done to-day. If the roof leaks or there
Is a crack in the ceiling or a loose board
in the floor or a sagging hinge. or a broken
window cord, they repair the damage at
once. They know perfectly that it costs
Jes3 to mend than to mar, and marring
goes rapidly on where there Is no merfd
ing. As everybody knows the best way
to let even a fine house go to absolute
ruin is to shut it up and leave it without
an inhabitant. A house that is lived in
lasts longer and looks better than a house
that Is untenanted, because the forces of
nature are constantly making war upon
the buildings of men, and a constant bat
tle must be waged against them if men
are 'to come off \*lctors.
The heedless housekeeper has casually
mentioned that there is a thin place' on
the stair carpet which will presently v.-ear
into a bole. She is not ignorant of a rip
ia a rug which may catch somebody's
heel and cause v tumble. -But being heed
less, Bht puts off repairing the rent in
tarpt-t and rug until an unlucky person
hurrying along has a fall, which means a
hip out of joint or a broken leg, or,
worse silll, a jar which may cause apo
plexy to some one in old age, or the de
velopment of a malignant disease in some
one younger. These baleful sequences do
come from slight falls, and somebody is
responsible. Â«
A variety of miseries shuffle along in
the train of so-called . accidents, which
never should have been permitted to oc
cur. From time to time people <iie be
cause they have eaten toadstools when
they thought they were eating mush
rooms. Nothing is easier than to dlsttn
iruish between the delicious edible and the
deadly fungus, yet there are those who
mourn such deaths as if they were laid
at the door of accident.
Children are sometimes left in the caie
of thoughtless hirelings and are maimed
for life through falls for which, there, is
neither excuse nor occasion. A man fear
fully deformed with a great hump be
tween his shoulders was in his infancy the
most noble and beautiful of children.
While his pretty nurse was flirting with
a gallant policeman the baby carriage
took a slide down a steep hill and was
overturned at the foot, and years of pain
and wretchedness with the handicap of
the hunchback have paid for that folly.
We eeldom read of a railroad accident
that is not due to the carelessness of
somebody, and yet it would be most' un
fair to utter sweeping criticisms. on the,
employes of public conveyances. The av
erage man is superbly trustworthy. The
engineer sticks to his post and dies in the
etfTort to save the train. When one of the
engines on the "Majestic" was suddenly,

did you gather from the woman's appear

"Well, the had a slate-colored, '\u25a0Â» broad

black beads se^n upon it, rather a fringe
of little . black jet ornaments. > Her ' dress

She had small, round, hanging sold ear
rings, and a generalalr of being "fairly
well-to-do, in a\-ulgaf, comfortable, easy

Sherlock Holmes clapped bis hands soft
ly together and chuckled.' \ ' .
" *Pon my word,^Watson,' you. are corn

done very well, indeed. ... It is .true that
you have missed everything ' of ."import

but * concentrate .yourself /' upon details.
My first glance is always ; at a woman's
sleeve. .'.ln a man it Is perhaps better; to
take the knee of the trousers. As you
observe, this woman' had plush upon her
â¢sleeves, which is a most useful material
for 6hoÂ»lng traces.- The double, line a-lit;
tie above ' the wrist,, where the; type
wriUst presses against the table, was
beautifully defined." The sewing j machine
of the hand type leaves a similar, mark,
but 'only, on -the left arm and on the side
of it farthest from 'the thumb, instead 'of
being right : across .the broadest' parti:. aa
this 'was. I thenglanced at her face and
observing the dint of a pincencz at cither
side of her nose I ventured a remark upon
short sight and typewriting, which seemed
to surprlsb her."
"It Burprised me."
"But surely it was very obvious. J was
then much surprised and interested .on
glancing down to observe that, though
the boots which she was wearing were
not unlike each other, they were really
odd ones, the one having a slightly deco
rated toe cap, and the other a plain one.
One was buttoned only in the two lower
buttons out of five, and the other at the
first, third and fifth. 'Now, when you ccc
that a young lady, otherwise neatly
dressed, has come away from home ,v.'ith
odd boots, half -buttoned, it is.no great
deduction to say that she came away in
a. hurry."
"And what else?" I asked, keenly inter
ested^ cs 1 always was, by my friend's
incisive reasoning.
"I noted in passing that she had writ
ten a note before leaving home, but after
being fully dressed. Y6u observed that
her right glove was torn at the foreflngsr,
but 'you did not apparently see 'that' both
glove and finger were stained with violet
ink. She bad written in a -hurry, and
dipped her pen too deep. It must Ij3ve
been this morning, or the mark would' not
remain clear upon the finger. All this -is
amusing, though rather elementary, bat
I must go back- to business, Watson.
Would you mind reading me th? adver

Wholesome Sentiment
Concerning Motherhood
(Copyright^ 1905,': by, Joseph 8.- Bowles.)
Â»4 -y o dispassionate critic can fail to
/V| ; to ace that agreat and pralse-
I \ worthy, change has come over the
.A : c ;\. spirit of American homes in the
NÂ»;* last .score of v years. Before our
: President called general attention to the
1 diminutive sire of American "families and
sounded his warning note about race sui
cide, a reaction had set In for the better
ment of conditions that were deplorable.
â¢ : 'A much more wholesome sentiment ob
tains among women than formerly as re
gards' the dignity of motherhood. To this
the Mothers' Congress and tile numerous
mothers' clubs throughout 4the country
have contributed^ arid the oft-repeated
opinions of those who believe that child
culture is not beneath any woman's
genius have brought an uplifting influ
ence. The expectant mother is not now
an object of pity among her acquaint
ances. Motherhood has become; an ad
mired and coveted state even, among mar
ried women of fashionâ and many, fami
lies are fearlessly going beyond the two
or three children who constituted not
long ago the ideal American group.
Race suicide is therefore not a menace
to be . dreaded, from the standpoint of
the man, who loves his country and hopes
to* . see " her sons and daughters born in
numbers , sufficient to keep the balance
steady against ; the swarming crowds of
the foreign-born; as a counterpoise to
the throngs who ; see the light in homes
of deepest squalor and â¢ poverty. The
comfortable, thrifty, intelligent,- hard
working, plain-living; and high-thinking,
American citizen is to have his table sur
rounded "bjf bright, clever, ; lovable , chil
dren, life's crown and life's truest wealth.
Where, then, does a threat of .danger
Interpose Itself? The race suicide we
have reason to fÂ«ar, how shall we define
it? Â»
To me, at least; it seems that our great
est present peril, lies in the lowering; of
our standards of integrity, in our ac
ceptance ;of commercial success as the
only success j worth having, and \u25a0In \ our
mad desire for*ease and luxury. We are
becoming effeminate. Our boys and girls
shrink from labor. One finds . the chil
dren and grandchildren of tolling men
who earned their living by the sweat of
their ; . brow and the exerjplse of their
muscle shirking, chores^ about the house,
evading- mere' work "on the. plea of .atb-.
letlcs or study, and spending money ,wlth
a freedom and irresponsibility, that bodes
'IH for tl\e future. |
;The' education , of rich men's sons too
of ten tends to make . them idle and ele
gant' incapabtes, globe-trotters and spend

by the old trick of stepping in at one

of events, Mr. Windibank!"
.Our visitor had recovered: something

been ; talking, and he V rose from* his
chair now with a cold sneer upon his
palefacs.';

anxious to make money. .. So anxious are
we for the things that perish with the
using that we strain every nerve, sacrifice
health, good temper and self-respect to
get on, to secure* more money, to add
dollar. to dollar and, acre to acre. "One
million." I not long ago heard a woman
exclaim: "What Is one million? Why,
in this period it is nothing but genteel
poverty!" This is what we instil by pre
cept and example into the lives of our,
young people.
So it ha 3 naturally followed that sani
tariums flourish. Young men in thÂ«lr
haste to be rich break down with nervous
exhaustion. The sanitarium receives
vhem. They live to be nervous wrecks,
or improve to walk softly all their days.
Herein is a finger that points warnJngly
at race ' suicide.
â¢â¢ â¢ .
Another peril is In the Increasing li
cense among women -of character and
reputation in certain indulgences and rec
reations once 'doubted or scorned by their
class- The card table in the drawfng
room. the practice among women of play
ing bridge whist for itakes, small, it Is
true, but waking the gamester's passion,
the practice of taking wine . socially and
in public places, as at restaurants and
In hotels, both tend toward blighting our
finest and noblest Instincts. For It Is
not only vulgar, coarse and garish women
of the nouveau riche type against whom
these complaints are with reason lodged.
Delicately nurtured, beautiful and well
bred women suffer themselves to fight en
nui and to drift with the fashionable cur
rent, playing cards by daylight, "as it the
ghosts of their grandmothers were- not
hovering over them hi stern surprise.
They sip cordials and pick-me-ups at
dainty tables, as if they had never heard
of temperance and propriety.' This talk
is not written to enforce total abstinence;
It is Intended to remind good women of
the cruelty and sin of putting . temptation
in the way of others, and of causing the
weak brothtr to stumble. .
Race suicide may as truly be wrought
by those who enervate the race, who kill
its valor, deplete its virtue, anl mock
its self -denials, as by. those who limit the
number of its .newly born.
, The cry of the pessimist is perhips un
seasonable. But the most obstinate op
timist cannot shut his eyes to the fact
that we readily condone acts of dishonor
that we once condemned, and that we. are
too tolerant of excuses for wrongdoing
if they present themselves in royal purple
with a golden clasp. The old note of^
poverty and simplicity needs to sound its
austere 3ignal in our ears if the soul
suicide of the race is to-be averted.
In every land and age vast resources
and large * material wealth have been
stepping stones, to corruption. Too much
luxury paralyzes endeavor. From time to
time somebody's shipwreck startles us;
some one in whom the public have had
confidence suddenly is discovered to have
abused that trust, cr in some way to
have gone wrong.
We need an overwhelming sentiment
against graft, and in favor of purity and
honesty. Only in the home can this be
nurtured. Only there by. those who love
their country and fear God can race sui
cide be * averted. Let us, learn from the^
memories of our glorious"' past, from the
Spartan traditions of those who: have

never was a man who deserved pun
ishment more. If the young lady has
a brother or a friend, ho ought to lay

sight of the bitter sneer upon the
man's face, "it ia not part of my duties
tomy client, but here's a hunting crop

myself toâ " He took two swift steps
to the whip, but before he could grasp
it* there was a wild ; clatter of t steps
upon 'the stairs, the : heavy doorbell
banged, and from the window we could
see i Mr. James Windibank running at
the top of his speed down the road.
"There's . a cold-blooded scoundrel,"
said Holmes laughing, as he threw
himself down Into his chair: once more.
i"That fellow will .rise from crime to
crime -until he does something very
bad, and : ends on the \ gallows. _ The
\u25a0case has, in". some resoects, been' not

"I cannot now entirely, see all the steps
of: your, reasoning." I remarked."
"Well, of course, it was" obvious from
the â¢ first " that this Mr. Hosmer Angel
must have some strong, object for his cu-
rious; conduct, aridit-'was equally 'clear
that * the : only man ! who really ' profited by
the incident. 1 ; as far as we could see, was
the stepfather. Then \the ; fact that ] the

feated for the Presidency. What It has
meant to him. Kow it has affected his
life. If he has regrets. I am still pre
senting the -question to him In its every
form when he Interrupts my Interro
gator^ acrobatics with what the poet
would have eald had he been a campaign
poet.
It Is perhaps a brassy thing to do, butâ
nothing venture nothing learn; and curi
osity gives my qualms their quietus, be
cause William Jennings Bryan, defeated
candidate for the Presidency, the man
who twice has missed the buliseye. Is a
thousand times more Interesting to me
than he could possibly be as President.
He reminds me of the little girl la
"Shore Acres." Can you hark back and
revive herâ the little girl who was pre
pared for the Thanksgiving festivities,
Sunday frock buttoned on. face washed,
heir smoothed, nose blâ well, everything
decently-done, and then led down to the
center of the stage in the full glare of
the footlights and admonished to "stay
put"? He reminds me of her because the
little girl wouldn't "stay put."
It's the same way with William Jen
nings Bryan.
Twice he has been told to "stay put"
Twice he has been declared politically
defunct 1 electoral majoritiesâ and, ac
cording to precedent, there is nothing
deader than a defeated Presidential can
dictate; nothingâ except an ex-President.
Five years, three years, yes, one year
after the successful man has been In
augurated we f.tk each other. "Who ran
against him? On, yes. to be sure, it was
. John G. ; or was It James K.?
So careless of me to forget, but. then,
I'm not good at remembering names and
dates. Anyhow, his name was ."
Ten -years after we refer the question

query editor about it to decide a. bet. and
twenty years after we know we can find
out by looking In the encyclopediaâ lt
only we could remember under which let
ter to look. Â»
Ac for ex-Presidents, for years and
years the problem of what to do with
them has mildly agitated & kindly, not
ungrateful nation Into considering every
mode of preservation except that cf the
taxidermist.
Eo by all the rules of the game William
i Jeffnlngs Bryan should be "a dead one."
But he isn't.
He firmly refuses to be.
He won't even play dead.
He flies in the face of all precedent and
example, even of political propriety.
It Is the proper thingâ the propriety
having been established by precedent and
exampleâ for the man who has been can
didate for the high office of President tÂ«
retire upon his defeat Into circumspect
and Inactive private life. All activities,
public or prhate. are beneath the dignity
of the man who might have been Presi
dent. He may practice law If cases of
I sufficient magnitude and respectability
are offered him. He may become a figure
head, of course. If the honor and the sal
ary are sufficiently impressive; or, falling
in that, he can mortgage the farm or the
family residence. But whatever he does,
he must maintain his pose until he Is re
membered to the world apain by his obit
uaries.
It Is like being frozen into an attitude.
It Is soâ only more soâ with the ex-
President.
But !t isn't soâ not at all soâ with WH-
V 'dzm Jennings Bryan.
That is why he is so much more Inter
esting in his defeat than he would be as
President.
That, is why 1 put my questionâ which
put to another would be like wantonly
uncovering the sheeted deadâ without any
gulity sense of ghouMehness.
He is so .very much alive.
\\~hen ha missed the bullseye the

Is not a private and personal grievance.
Omceholding should' not be for' private
ends and- personal aggrandizement. A3
a candidate I represented a principle.
The 'principle still remains. It Is llkÂ»
offering a remedy for a disease. If .the
sufferer will not have it It does not fol
low-that the remedy loses Its efficacy,
but the sufferer remains uncured.
"Even from the personal point of
view to have run and lost has had Its
value. My life has been along broader
lines in consequence, broader than It
would have been in my power to make
it without these "opportunities.,

It Is not usual, I say. for the man

â¢There is going to be a great awaken
ing." he says. -People are taking &
wider and more intelligent Interest in
government, and that can lead to only
one result, better government. Such
an awakening is a good thing. Good
government is dependent on the sus
tained and intelligent Interest of the
people governed. To leave our gov
ernment, local or national. In tho hands
of â¢ cliques, to professional politicians,
to" the "machine/ results in corruption.
Several years of apathy followed by
a spasmodic upheaval, a sudden fever
of reform, and then a return to apathy
doesn't result in good government. It
depends on tha intelligent understand
ing and constant vigilance of the peo
ple.
"Every person should take an Inter
est in government."
You see Mr. Bryan doesn't say poll
tics, and he doesn't say "every man."
Something of .tha largeness and lib
erality of his point of viaw lies in tha
difference.
"Every person should tako an inter
est in* government, and be concerned
about it. Many people think and many
people foster the belief that it is dif
ficult to understand â¢ tha principles of
government, that it is a complicated
thing;- but it is not. Every one can
come to an understanding of the prin
ciples involved. The methods of gov
ernment may be intricate, sometimes,
but the prinicples are simple.
"When any one sets out to tell the
people that the sclanco of government
is too difficult and complicated a study
for them to master, there's a reason for
it. It's safe to infer it isn't for the good
of the people.
."If a man were to ask me to Invest
in a business and tell me that it was
too complicated, too deep for me to un
derstand; that tie could understand it.
but 1 couldn't. I should be suspicious.
*' mi mmw ' MWjanwi m" Jfrijf mt iÂ«f*~~Mi \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0â¢-mm
I should want to know all about it.
or not have anything to do with It, and
the same thing holds good about gov
ernment.
"So long as the peoplo take an intel
ligent Interest in their Government and
continue that Interest they are safe.
They may make mistakes, but they
will find that out and correct them.
They are interested in doing what is
best for their own welfare. IX they
come to the belief that* It reaulf es spe
cialists to understand and operate the
government, mistakes will be made,
and they will not be in the interests of
the people.
"There la just one danger, and that la
in a government that does not trust tha
peopleâ in a government moved by
class prejudice, or class interest. Tha
.\u25a0\u25a0.-â¢
people can be trusted. Government Is
safe in their hands. They will try to
give themselves what they want. They
may not always know what thay want,
or what is best for thÂ«ir welfare. They
may make, mistakes; but they, can bo
trusted to discover and remedy tnose
mistakes, to work always so far as they
know how for the common good, and
not * for private or class interests
against' tha common good.
"I think the tima is coming when men
will limit themselves as to the amount
of money they will make, that thay
will voluntarily set a' limit upon taeir
fortunes, and that after bavins reached
that limit they will cease money-mak
ing and devote themselves to the in
terests of good government, making a
study of the principles of government
and taking part in its administration.
Having no occasion for "self-interest,
having the time and freedom from
private responsibilities, such men could
bring their very best capabilities to ttta
Improving of government:
\u25a0 "Men should not wait until such a
time, however, to take an interest and
have a share in government. It U
every man's duty from tha time- ha is
a man. -to take an interest and have a
share in the government under walcU
he lives, local and national. \u25a0
"It should be an interest quite apart
from- a selfish Interest in office-hold-
"No man sjhould care about office
holding because of selfish and personal
reasons.
"The matter of omce-holdlng is, thÂ«
matter, of availability. The need of a
time. or condition determines tha man.
The man responds to the need. That
is the ideal condition that can be real
ized.
"It Is, for example, as if t. child -f alia
into a stream and is in danger of
drowning, and a man comes along at
the critical moment when the child is
struggling 1 In the water. -He Is the
available man. He is there, on the' spot,
and it; ls his duty to save that child.
V "It is not for any man trying to do
bis, duty as a citizen to say whether be
will; or will not hold office." .
A question trembles on the tip of my
tongue:
"Would you. . would you â **

gravely he says:

wise or not, . and the course of courage
always frightened him. He bit his lip
and dissembled his anger. Presently be
btgan to pace up and down the room, his
head bent, his hands clasped behind him.
After perhaps flve minutes he paused to
say: "You insist on taking the place

I stood before liim and looked down at
him. "Your suspicion that I have also
a personal reason is well founded. James,"
said I. "I wouldn't put myself in a po

CHAPTER' XXI.
An Interlude.
I dismissed business and politics and
went cruising on vhe lakes with restful,
non-political Fred Sandys. After we
had been knocking about perhaps
a week, we landed one noon at the
private pier of the Liscombes to lunch
with them. Ab Sandys and I strolled
toward the front of the house several
people, also guests for lunch, were just
descending from a long buckboard.' At
sight of one of ' them I stopped short
inside, though I mechanically continued
to walk toward her. I recognized her
instantly â the curve of her shoulders,
the poise of her head, and her waving
jet-black hair to confirm. And without
the slightest warning there came tum
bling and roaring up in me a torrent
of longings, regrets; and I suddenly
had a clear understanding of my ab
sorption in this wretched game I had
been playing year In and year out 'with
hardly a glance up from the. table.
That wretched game .with its. counter
feit stakes; and the more a man wins,
the poorer he Is.
She seemed calm enough as she faced
me. Indeed, I was not sure when she
had first caught sight of me, or'whether
the had' recognized me, until Mrs. Lis
combe began to introduce .us. "Oh,
yes," she then interrupted, "I remember
Senator Sayler very well.' We used to
live la the same town. We went to the
same school." And with a friendly
smile the gw* me her hand. ,
What did I say? Ido not know. But
I am sure I gave no sign of the clamor
within. -I, had not cultivated surface
calm all those years in vain. I talked,
and she talked â but I saw only her
face, splendid fulfillment of the promise
of girlhood; I hardly; heard her words,
so greatly was her voice moving me.
It was an unusually deep voice for a
woman, sweet and with a curious
carrying quality that made it seem
stronger than it was. ' In figure she
was delicate; but radiant of life and
health â aglow, not ablaze. She was
neither tail nor short, and was dressed
simply, but in the fashionâ l beard
the other women discussing her clothes
after she left. And : she still had the
mannerism that was most fascinating
to me â she kept her eyes down while
she was talking or listening, and raised
them now and then, with a full, slow
look at you.
When Mrs. Liscombe asked her to
txime to dinner the next evening with
the people she was visiting,. she said:
-'Unfortunately. I must start lor Wash
ington in the morning. I' am overhaul
ing niy school and building an addi
tion." â
It had not occurred to me. to think
where she had come from" or' bow she
happened to be there, or of anything in
the years since I was last with her.
The reminder, that she had. a school
came as la shockâ rShe was', so; utterly
unlike ray notioqVo'f the .head of -a
school. I think she Â«p.w7or fÂ«lt what
v.-as In my. mind, for" she went on. to
mr: "I've had it six years nowâthe
next will be the seventh." -:
"Do you like It?" I asked.
"Don't I !ook like a happy. woman?"
\u25a0 "You do," said I, after our eyes had
met. "You are."
.."There were sixty girls last yearâ
slxtyÂ»three," she went on. "Next year
there will be more â about a hundred.
It'a like a garden, and I'm the gar
dener, busy from morning till night,
with no time to think of anything: but
my plants and flowers."
She had conjured a picture that made
my heart ache. 1 suddenly felt old and
sad and loaelyâ a forlorn failure. * "I
too am a gardener," said I. "But it's
a sorry lot of weeds and thistles that
keeps me occupied. And in the midst
of - the garden is a plum treeâ that
bears Dead Sea fruit."
She was silent.
"You don't care for poilticÂ»7" said L
"No," she replied, and lifted and low
ered her â¢yes in a slow ' glance that
made me wish I had not asked. "It is,.
I think, gardening with weeds and this
tles, as you say." Then, after a pause:
"Do you like it?"
"Don't ask me," I said with a bitter
ness that. made us both silent there
after.;
That evening I got Fred to land me
at the nearest town. The train sh*
must have been;. on had just gone. In
the morning I took the express for the
East. .Arrived- at Washington. 1 drove
straight to her school.
A high iron fence, not obstructing the
view from the country road; a Ions;
drive under arching maples and
beeches; a rambling, fascinating old
house upon the crest of a bill; many
windows, a pillared' porch, a low, very
wide- doorway. It 'seemed like her in
its dark, cool, odorous beauty.'
She herself was in the front hall, di
recting some workmen. "Why, Senator
SaylÂ«r, this is a surprise,", she said, ad
vancing to greet me. But there was.
no suggestion of surprise in her tone
or her look, only a friendly welcome
to. an acquaintance.
She led the way into the drawing
room to the left. The furniture and
pictures were in ghostly draperies;
tsverythlng was in confusion. We went
011 to a side veranda, seated ourselves.
She looked inquiringly at me.
"I do not know why," was my, an
swer. "I only know â 1 had to come." j
She studied me calmly. 1 remember
\u25a0 her look, ' everything about her â the
embroidery on the sleeves and bosom of
her blouse, the buckles on her white
shoes. 1 remember also that there was
a breeze, and how good it felt to my
hot face, to my eyes burning from lack,
of sleep. At last she said: "Weilâ
what do you think of my little king
dom?"
"It is yours â entirely?"
"House, gardens â everything. I paid
the last of ray debts in June." "
"I'm contrasting it with my ' own,"
I said. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0-' : \u0084. \u25a0 .; . â¢ \u25a0
"But that isn't fair," she protested
with a smile. "You must remember,
I'm only, a woman."
"With my' own," I went ori.'as'lf she
had not interrupted. ' "YourÃ isâ yours/
honestly got. It makes you proud,
happy. Mme â "I did not finish, v-r
She must have' seen or. felt how pro
foundly I was moved, for I presently
saw her looking at me with an expres
sion I might have resented for Its pity
from any other than her. "Why do you
tell me this?" she asked.
"There. is always for every one," was
my answer, "some person to whom he
shows himself as he is. You. are that
person for me becauseâ l'm surrounded,
by people who care for me for what ; I
can give. Even my children care to a
great extent for that, reason. It's the
penalty for having the power to give
the material things all human beings
crave. Only two persons ever eared
care much for me just because I was
myself. "They were my motherâ and
you. "
She laughed in quiet raillery. "Two
have cared for you, but you have cared
for only one. And what devotion you
have given him!'.*
;"I; "I have cared for my mother â for. my
childrenâ"
"Yes â your children. I forgot them."
"Andâ for \u25a0 you."
She made, what I thought a move
ment of impatience.
"For you,"-I repeated. Then: "Eliza
beth; you were right when you wrote
that I was a coward."
She rose and stoodâ near enough- to
me for me to catch her. faint, elusive
perfumeâ and gazed out into : the dis
tance.
.. "In St. Louis the other day," I went
on, "I saw a mAn who lias risen to
power greater than I can ever hope to
have. And he got it by marching erect
in the open."
*"Yet you have everything you used
to want," she said dreamily.
"Yesâ everything. Only to learn how
worthless what I wanted was. And for
this trash, thisdlrt,:i have given-rail
1 had that was of value."
"All?"
"All," I replied; "Your love and my
own self-respect."
â¢'Why do you think you've not been
brave?" she asked after a while.
"Because I've won by playing on -the
weaknesses and fears of men which 1 my
Own weaknesses and fears enabled me
to understand."
"You have done wrongâdeliberate
ly?" \u25a0rZ&ggg&b
"Deliberately."
"But that good might come?"
"So I told myself."
"And good has come?. I haVe : heard
tHat figs do grow, on thistles."
"Good has come. '" But, I think, In
spite of me, not . through me.";-'
''But now that you see," she said,
turning her eyes to mine with appeal
in them, and something more,' I
thought, "you willâ -you ' will not go
on?" :
"I don't know. Is, there such a thing
as remorse without; regret?" =, And then
my self-control 'went:and;l;let;hor see
what I had commanded myself to k*cp
hid: "I only know '-clearly one thing,
Elizabethâ only one thing matters. .You
are the whole world to me. You and I
couldâ what could we riot do together!"
Her color' slowly, rose, slowly van
ished; "Was that what you came to
tell mÂ»?" she asked. V.

I returned to Fredonia and sent
Woodruff Ea3t. to direct a campaign of
calamity-howling in the Eastern press,
for the benefit of the New York, Bos
ton.-and Philadelphia "captains of in
dustry." At . the end of ten days I re
called him, and sent Roebuck to Wall
streets to- confirm the fears and alarms
Woodruffs campaign had aroused. And
In the .West I was laying out ths money
I had been able to .collect i from the
heading men of Minnesota,' lllinois. Ohio
and Western Pennsylvania"â except a
-quarter of a million from Howard of
New York, to whom we gave the vtce
presidential nomination for that sum,
and about half a million more given by
several Eastern men, -to 'whom we
promised Cabinet offices, and posts
abroad. 1 put all this money, not far
from two millions. Into our "campaign
of education". and into those inpourlngs
of delegations upon Burbank at his
"rural retreat."
To attempt to combat Scarborough's
popularity with the rank and file of his
own party was hbpeless. I contented
myself with restoring order and arous
ing enthusiasm In the main body of
our partisans in the -doubtful and un
easy States. , : So. ruinous .had been
. Goodrich' s management that aven at
that comparatively . simple , task; we
should not have succeeded, but for thÂ«
fortunate fact that the great mass of
partisans â¢ refuses to hear;* anything
from the other side; they regard , rÂ«a
soningr as .disloyalty â which, curiously
enough, it so often is. Then, too, t ow
newspapers In the doubtful States
printed the truth about - what Scarbor
ough and his supporters wera saying
and doing. The cost of this perversion
of publicity to usâ direct money cost. I
meanâ was â¢ almost nothing. - 1 ThÂ« * bis
papers and news associations were big
properties, and their rich proprietors
were interested in enterprises to which
Scarborough's election ; meant disaster;
a multitude of the smaller pepers. nor
mally of the opposition, were dependent
upon those same enterprlses-for the ad
vertising that kept them alivt.
. Perhaps tba most far-slghtedâcer
talnly, "as .the. event showed,'- the' most
fortunateâ single stroke of -J my cam
paign was done in Illinois. That Stats
was vital, to our success; .also it was
one of the doubtful States where, next
to his own Indiana, Scarborough's
chances were best. I felt that we must
put a heavy handicap: on *hls popularity
there. I had noticed. that, in Illinois the
violently radical .wing of .the opposition
was very strong." So I sent:Merri-'
weather to strengthen the radicals still
further. I hoped to make. them strong
enough' to put through their : party's
State convention a platform that would
be a scarecrow to timid-voters In Illi
nois, and throughout the West; and I
wished for a "wild man" as the candi
date for Governor, but I didn't hope it.
though I told Merriweather It must bÂ«
done. ': Curiously â¢ enooghj my . calcula
tion; of the probabilities;: was just re
versed. The radicals "were 'beaten on
platform; but, thanks to a desperate
effort': of *Merrlweather*s in : "coaxing"
rural delegates. \u25a0 a frothing, wild-eqed.
political crank got the nomination.
And he never -spoke during-.. the 'cam
paign that he. didn't drive, voters array
from his .ticketâ and, therefore, from
Scarborough./ And our machine there
sacrificed^ the local. interests to the gen
eral;, by nominating a popular and not
Insincere reformer.
When Roebuck and I descended upon
Wall street on October IS, -three wteks
before "election. I had everything in
readiness for," my final antl t real cam
paign; .{\u25a0-\u25a0
Throughout '.the .doubtful . States,
WoodruJT was .in touch with- local -ma
chine 'leaders" of Scarborough's 'party,
with "; corruptible , labor and r fraternal
order leaders, with every." element that
.would 'for a cash, price deliver a body
of voters on'elsctlon day: Also he had
arranged in'- those States for the ."riyhl
sort" of flection officers at upward of
five 'hundred polling places,: at least
half of them 'places where several hun
dred\votes could, be- shifted r-withoutr -without
danger _or suspicion. :;.\lao, Burbaolt
and our corps ' ; of "spellbinder*" hadj
succeeded " beyond ray hopes ln'~rouslnÂ»
partisan passionâ but here asratn part
of : the V_ credit *< belongs to Woodruff.
Never before ' had "there., been so manyfret' barbecues, distributions of frÂ«e
uniforms to well-financed Burbank 'and
Howard campaign clubs, and arrang
ing of those expensive parades In
which the average citizen delights. The
wiiuv Woodruff- spent neariy one-third
Â«f my ."education" money in tills way.
One morning I found him laughing,
over the bill for a grand Burbank rally
at Indianapolis â about thirty-five thou
sand dollars, as I remember the figures.
"What amuses you?" said I.
"I was thinking what fools the peo
ple rre. never to ask themselves where,
ail the money for these '.free^ shows
comes from, and why those who give
are willing to give so much, and how
they get it back. "What an ass the pub
"Fortunately." said I.
Â£or us, sn iv ITC .. â¢
"And for itself." I rejoined.
"Perhaps," he admitted. "It was born
to be plucked. and.l suppose our crowd
does do the plucking more scientifically
than less experienced hands would."
"I prefer. toput ft another way.", said
I. "Let's say that we save it from a
worse plucking."
"That Is .better." said Doc. For,* on
his way up-in the world, he was rapidly
developing-. what could, and should,
called conscience. * v
I looked at him and once more had \u25a0
a Qualm like shame before his moral
superiority to me. We were plodding
along on about the same moral level:
but he had ascended to that level, while
I had descended to it. There were poll-*
ticians posingas pure before the world
,and even in the -party's, behind-the
scene, who would have sneered at Doc's
"conscience." Yet, to my notion, they,
who started high and from whatever
sophistry of motive- trailed down into
the "mire. are. lower far than they who
began deep in the mire and have been
struggling bravely toward the surface.
I. know a man who was born in the
slums, was a pickpocket at 8 years of.
'age. was a boss at 45. administering^
justice according to his lights. 1 know
a man who was born what he calls a
gentleman and who. at 45. sold himself
for the "honors" of a high office. And
once, after he had shaken hands with
that boss, he looked at me, furtively
made a wry face., and wiped his hand
with his pefeket handkerchief! '
The other part of our work "of prep
aration â getting the Wall street whales
in condition for the "fat-frying" â was"
also finished. The. Wall street Roebuck
and I adventured was in a state of
quake from fear of the election- of "the.
scourge of God." as our subsidized so
cialist and extreme radical papers had
dubbed Scarborough â and what Invalu
able campaign material their praise of
him did make for us!
Roebuck and I went from office to
office among the great of commerce, in
dustry and finance. We were received
with politeness, deferential politeness ,
everywhere. But not a penny could we
get. Everywhere the same answer:
".W"c cannot see our way to contribut
ing just yet. But if you will -call early
next weekâ say Monday or Tuesday"â
four or five days awayâ "we'll let you
know what we can do." The most ar- .
dent- eagerness to placate us. to keep
us in good humor; but not a centâ^until
Monday or Tuesday.
When I hfard "Monday or Tuesday"
for the thjrd time, ray suspicions were"
roused. When I he*rd it for the fifth
time. I understood. Wall street- waÂ» '
negotiating with the other stde.land
would know the result by Monday* or-;'
at the latest Tuesday.
In Which a Mnoite Helps \u25a0 Lion.
I did not dare communicate my sus
picions to my "dear friend" Roebuck.
As it was, with each refusal I had
seen his confidence *in me sink: If he
should get an inkling how near to utter
disaster I and my candidate were, he
would be upon me like a tiger upon its
trainer wften he slips. I reasoned out
my course while we 'were descending from
the fifth "king's" office to our cab: If
the negotiations with the opposition
should be successful. I should not get
a cent; if they should- fail. Wall street
would be frantic, to get its contribu
tionsinto my hand; therefore, the only
sane thing' to do was to go West, and
make such preparations as I could
against the worst.
""Let's go back to the Holland," said
I to Roebuck, in 'a. weary, bored tone.
"These people are a waste of time. I'll
start home to-night, and when they see
In the morning papers that I've left for
good they may come to their senses.
But they'll have to hunt me out. I'll
not "go near tnem again. And when
they come dragging themselves to you,
don't forget ho*vv they've treated us to
day."
Roebuck was silent, glancing furtive
ly at me now and then, not knowing
what to think. "How is it possible to
win without them?" he finally said.
"This demagogue Scarborough has set
the people crazy. I can't imagine what
possesses these men of property with
interests throughout the country. They
are Inviting ruin."
I smiled. "My dear Roebuck," I re
plied, "do you suppose I'm the man to
put all ray eggs Into one basket â and
that basket Wall street?"
Arid I refused to talk any more poll
tics with him. We dined together, I
calm and in the best of spirits; we went
to a musical farce, and he watched me
glumly as I showed my lightness of
heart. Then I went alone, at midnight,
to the Chicago Express sleeper â to. lie
awake all night staring at the" phan
toms of ruin that moved in dire panor
ama before zne. In every great affair
there -is a crisis at which one must
stake all upon a single throw. I had
staked all upon Wall street.' With
out Its contributions. Woodruff's . ar
rangements could not be carried out.
When I descended at the Fredonia
station I found De Milt waiting for
me. He had news that was indeed
news. I shall give It here more'con
secutively than- my impatience for the
event permitted him to give it to me.
About ten days before, a paragraph,
iv one of Burbank's "pilgrimage"
speeches had been twisted by the re
porter so that it seemed a personal
attack upon Scarborough. As Burbank
was a stickler for the etiquette of cam
paigning, he not only sent out a denial

Milt to go to Scarborough's home at
Saint X, Indiana, and convey the ex
plantation Jn a personal message. De
Milt arrived at Saint X at 8 In the even
ing. As he was leaving the parlor car
he caw a man emerge from its draw
ing-room, make a hasty descent to the
platform, hurriedly engage a station hack
and drive away. De Milt had
a.n amazing memory for identities
something far rarer than memory
merely for faces. He was convinced he
knew that man; and being shrewd and .
lulck of thought, he Jumped into a trap 7
ird told the driver, to follow the "hack;
wMch was just disappearing." 'A few
CHAPTKP. XXIII.
minutes' driving and he saw it turn'ln
at a gateway. ' . â¢
"Whose place is that?" he. asked. '\u25a0
"The old' Gardiner homestead."; was
the answer. ../"President' Scarborough
lives there.'* it ...... ' -.' .' .. *
* De" Milt did not discuss this rather
premature entitling of ' Senator \u25a0, Scar
borough., * He said: "Ohâ l've made;a
mistake," descended and sent' his trap
away. Scarborough's house was 1 quiet,
not a soul about, lights in only. a.;few
windows. De Milt strolled in at the
open gate, and keeping out of .view,
made a detour of the gardens, the ."lay"
of- which he could see by the starlight"
He was soon in line with the front door
âhis man was par.eying. with a servant.
"Evidently he's not expected," thought
ray- chief of publicity. \u25a0
Soon his man entered. De" Milt, keep-
ing in, the ' shadows, moved round'the
house until ' he was close" under., open
windows from which came lighUand
men's voices. Peering through a bush
he -paw at a Ãble-desk a man whour
he recognized as Senator Scarborough.
Seated opposite â¢ him; with a vÂ«ry un
<-asy, deprecating expression on h}s
face, was John Thwing, president of the
Atlantic and Western System, and Sen
ator Goodrich's brother-in-law.
â¢â¢De Milt could not hear what Thwing
was saying, so careful was that exper
ienced voice to reachonly the ears^for
whom its insinuating- subtleties were
intended. But he' saw a puzzled; look
come into Scarborough's face, heard
him say: "I don't think" I understand
you, John."
Thwing uncpnEciously raised his
voice in his reply, and De Milt caught
â "satisfactory assurances from\ you
that these alarming views and inten
tions attributed to you are false, and
they'll be glad to exert themselves ; to
elect you."
Scarborough Smiled. "Impossible." he
said. "Very 7ew of them would sup
port me in any circumstances."
"Yo-u are mistaken. Ham'pden.'.'f was
Thwing's answer. "On the contrary,
they willâ" '
Scarborough interrupted with an im
patient motion of his head. "Impos
sible!" he repeated, "But in any case,
why shouli! tht y send you to me? My
speeches speak for themselves. Surely
no Intelligent man could fancy that my
election would mean harm to any
legitimate business, great or small.
East or West. You needn't come to me
for permission to reassure your -friends
â suchof them as you can hones.tly re
assure." \
"I have, been 1 them,"
Thwing answered. '"I .tell them" that
you are about the last rilan in the. world
to permit mob rule." ,;â¢
"Precisely," said Scarborough. ."I
purpose to continue to^do what I can
to break up the mob that is being led
on by demagogues disguised as-cap
tains of Industry and advance agents
of prosperity-Med on to" pillage", the re
sources of. the country, its riches and
its character." * ". \u25a0
This' ought to have put Thwing on
his guard. But. convinced that .. the
gods he worshiped must.be the gods of
all men, whatever they: might profess,
he held to his purpose. /
, "Still, you don't quite follow, me," he
persisted. "You've said some very dis
quieting things "against, some -of '" my
.friends-^ â of \u25a0 courser' they,' understand'
that the exigencies of- campaigning, the
necessity of. rousing" the party. spirit,

dency?" . \u25a0 --: â¢'â¢' \u25a0 â¢ . '. .'. '.;-'.
"My dear Hampden," expostulated
Thwing, "nothing^of the sort. Simply
that the campaign fund which Burbank
must get to be elected" won't go to -him,
but will be at the disposal of- your na
tional committee. My friends, natural
\u25a0ly. won't support their enemies." ,: ,-.'\u25a0
De- Milt, watching Scarborough, saw
him lower his -head, his face flushing
deeply. â¢ " :
"Believe me,i Hampden," continued
Thwing. "without our support Burbank
is beaten, and you are, triumphantly
â¬-lected â not otherwise. But you know;
po4itics; I needn't tell. you. You know
that the Presidency depends upon get
ting the doubtful element in the doubt
ful States."
Scarborough stood, and, without lift
ing his eyes, said in a voice very dif
ferent from his strong, clear tones of
a few minutes before: "I suppose in this
day no one is beyond the reach of in
sult. I have thought I .was. 1 see I
have been mistaken. And it is a man
who has ;known me' twenty years and
has called me friend, who. has taught
me the deep meaning of the. -..word
shame. The servant will-show you the
door." And he left Thwing. alone' in
the room. \u25a0
I had made De Milt (give me the point
of his story as soon as I saw its drift.
Whilo he was going over it indetail.
I w<is. thinking out all the bearings of
Scarborough's upon my. plans.
\u25a0"Has Senator Goodrich seen. Governor
Burbank yet?" I asked De Milt 1n a
casual tone, wjien he had' told how 'he
escaped unobserved in-Tiiwhig's wake
and delivered ' Burbank's # message the
next morning."
"I believe he's to see him by appoint
ment" to-morrow," -replied De Mllt.-
So my suspicion \u25a0 was .well-founded.
Goodrich, informed of his : brother-in
law's failure, was posting- to J? make
peace on whatever : terms he - could
honcyfuglc out of my conclliAtlon-mad
candidate.
A few; minutes lateral shut- myself
hr with the long-distance f te!ephnne and
roused .Burbank. from bed _;and. from
sleep.- "I am coming by the 'first
train to-morrow," I said; "I ; thought
you'd be glad to know.' that I've made
satisfactory arrangements In New: York
â-unexpectedly satisfactory." ... â¢ ..
"That's goodâ excellent," .came the
reply. I noted -i an instant change of
tone which' told me that Burbank 'had
got. by some underground route, news
of my failure \u25a0in New York \u25a0 and â¢ had
been preparing to give Goodrich a cor
dial reception. , - . \u25a0 -
"If Goodrich com^s. James." I went
on. "don't see him till I'vo seen you." '
A pause, then in a -strained voice:
"But I've given' him an appointment at
9 to-morrow." . . -. , . : :
"Put him off till noon. I'll be there
at 11. It's â imperative." That last
word with an Bccent Tdld -noflike ;to
use. but knew how to "useâ and; when.
. Another pause, then:> ;"Very well,;
Harvey. But we must be careful about
him. De Milt has told you'-how^dan^*
gcrous.he.is. hasn't he?"' 7 ' â¢ ' â¢
"Yes-^â how "dangerous he* tried .to -be."
I was about to add that Goodrich was
a fool to permit any oneto go to such
a" man as Scarborough \wlth such a
proposition;; but, I bethought ..me 'of
Burbank's acute 'moral sensitiveness
and how it would berasped;by the lm-"
plication- of his opponent's moral supe

"Burtank gave me a dose of his 'great
'\u25a0' and gracious way'â you ought to see the

>' over to Gocdrich. He had been mighty
â¢ careful not to give himself away any fur

[ "Very imprudent," was my comment.
"i'es," he admitted, "bur I 'had to do
something to get the dirt off my

"So Burbank has gone to Goodrich!"
I went on presently, as much to myself
as to him!. - â¢ .
* -"1 \u25a0 alwavg knew he was one of those
chaps you have to keep scared to keep
straight." said Woodruff. "They think
your politeness Indicates fear and your
frit-nd&hip fright. Besides,- he's got a
delusion that his popularity carried the
-West- for him and that you and I did
him only damage." , Woodruff inter
rupted himself to lau.cn. "A friend of
mine," he resumed, "was on the train
with Scarborough r.'h.>n he went -East
to the meeting- of Congress last month.
He tells me it was like a* President
elect on the war to be inaugurated.
The people turned out at every cross
ing, even beyond the Alleghanies. And
Burbank knows it. If he wasn't clean "
daft about himself he'd realize that if
It hadn't been for you â well, I'd hate
to say how badly he'd have got left.
But then, if it hadn't been for you he'd
never have' been Governor. He was a
dead one. and you hauled him out of
the tomb." . ;
. True enough. But what did It mat
ter now?
"He's going to get a horrible jolt be
fore, many months." Woodruff went on.
"I can see' vou after, him." *
â¢ "You forget. - He's President." I an
swered. "He's beyond our reach."
: "Not when he wants a renomlnation."
insisted Woodruff.
. "He can get that without us-^lf," I
said. "You must remember we've made
him- a fetish with our rank and 'file.
And he's something of a fetish with the
country, now that he's President. No.
we can't destroy himâ can't even injure
him. "-. He'll have to do that himself. If

. "Well"â Woodruff looked bitterly
- disappointed. "I ' guess you're right."'
He brightened. *"I forgot Goodrich for

\u0084 through .that â I'd have to be' in a sa

him, thanking him for his .messages \u25a0
and. inquiries during my illness and
saying that I was once more taking
part in 'affairs. He did not reply by/
calling me up on the telephone, as he Â£
would Shave done In the cordial. . Intl-

Instead he sent a telegram of con
gratulation, .following it 'with a note.
He urged me to go South, as" I * had
planned, and to stay untll-I was fully
restored. *'I shall deny myself "the.

..But; he made his state of mind even
clearer. His custom nad been to~ begin
his notes "Dear Harvey." or. "Dear Say

THE CAPTURE OF THE AUSTRALIA
Mineolar sent on this mission more
than two years ago, was wrecked, and
the provisions the -Australia took from
here were for tha^people who for two
years had lived on seal. meat and simi
lar diet, and to -whom bread*, of any
kind was an almost forgotten memory.
For two months the Australia had been
cruising from post to post carrying joy
and a change, of bfll-of-fare to hundreds
of exiled trappers, hunters and other em
ployes of the great .Russian trading com
pany. She was in Petropaulovski for the
second time when \u25a0 the bombardment
took p!ace 4 y . â¢ .
Sunday. August 13, was the day. ' Short
ly before noon the boom' of a gun was
heard. .'.:-- â¢ . .
"Somebody wants a pilot," remarked
Captain Rennie. c ' '
"Pilot hell!" volunteered an irreverent
sailor, pointing seaward. "It's, a Jap
cruiser, tir. Look." . '
And then the Suma of the Imperial-Jap
anese navy showed her' waNpalnted nose
around the : point where a Russian signal
fire was - already blazing Its warning, to
the distant .town. / '
The Suma. began, firing on the "â¢. point,
but soon discovered," there was nothing jj
there but the pile of blazing brush. -SKe
then disappeared around the point . and
in a few - minutes 1 - shells began ! sailing
through the sky, over the Australia; over
the town and bursting in, the .distant
hills. Between the " Australia and . the
cruiser was a ; low" hill- and on ' the "hill a
magazine; containing.' about fifty tons of
powder. *Had^thTs' magazine been struck"
the Australia and" ; her 'gallant, company
would have mingled their scraps â¢. wit h the
shattered structure' and such of the side
hill as was "affected "by the' explosion.
But the Suma . wltjidrew, returned ? to
where she first had been seen .arid began
banging away at th& Government â¢ build
ings behind the town.
The shells now" passed within thirty feet
of the Australia's bow and those on board
know air about the smell of powder, and ;
the shriek of shells.* -Two shots were fired %
before the Japs goi the range of., the
Government building and ithen : pat,, pat,
pat. oneafter the other, every shell made
a bullseye and the Government 'structure
\u25a0was among the. things of the pastl : - >
While the- shelling., was in progress
things were happening In Petropaulovski.
Superintending, the : construction' of ; a
wharf was an American, ; Bigelow/ by

town and tell the people that unless
a Russian official, a man. came out in
side of an hour; and formally surren
dered the town, the Suaia's guns would
blow Petropaulovskl to smithereens.
On board the Australia was Governor

When the rest of Petropaulovski sought
their cellars Wilderman. ran for his
camera. Under the arch of the scream
ing shells he Installed his tripod, and
before the bombardment had ended was
in possession of some splendid illustra
tions of the action of exploding shells.
Shortly after thÂ« firing ceased the
cruiser Ezuma joined the Suma at her an
chorage, and a little later a Japanese of
ficer boarded tne Australia and asked for
the ship's papers. After examining them
at length and cross-questioning Capta -J
Rennie he gave orders for steam to^lj
made and the vessel ready for sea by
noon the following day.
With a Japanese lieutenant on the
bridge, a Japanese engineer In the engine
room and seven Japanese bluejackets.-un
der their orders, the Australia left on
Monday. August 14. for Yokosuka. From
there the crew was sent in a navy '.ug
to Yokohama, where officers and men re
ported to the United States Consul.
And then there was more trouble.
During the Australia's voyage from this
port there developed a slight lealr In the
deck above the forecastle. It was nothing
sertou3. but enough to make '.he fore
castle uncomfortable for the men. They
complained.^ As there were no -passengers
on board the sailors were given quart***
in* the cabin staterooms, and there Un
developed a taste for the luxury of inde
pendent quarters that will forever make
them dissatisfied with life In the fore
castle, where all bunks open into the
same big, bare room.
. Not realizing that he was dealing with
stateroom sailors, the Consul sent the
men Jo the Salvation Army barracks at
Yokohama, where they were provided
with quarters better than those in any
forecastle, but- lacking the comfort and
conveniences of the Australia's state
rooms.
And- the sailors began to kick. , : i
Stateroom life develops sea lawyers, sju
the Consul and Captain Rennie are said
to nave had a lively time withstanding
the convincing arguments hurled at them
to back the mariners' demand for accom
modations at some first-class hotel. The
United States law is very explicit on the
rights of -sailors situated as these men
were, and Captain Rennie and the Consul
saw that the law was . strictly complied
with, but when the liner's officers sailed
for home on the Empress of India, sail
ors. Consul and captain were still main
taining a three-cornered argument.
The Australia was committed for trial,
just like a.boodling Senator, and Captain
Rennie is still in Japan awaiting the ds
" cision of the Japanese prize court.
The Governor, of Petropaulovskl rniy
have returned to his post.
it Is all the more important" to hayÂ«
it correct and fair, for there have been
startling Instances in history when the
voice of the people was not the voice
of God, when" men suffered- persecu-Â«*
tlon and obloquy unjustly, simply bÂ«Â»^
cause they were made the victims . of
temporary popular frenzy which on the
morrow may have completely reversed
its judgment. But in this age the
"spread of education and of the reading
habit and the progress of rational and.
wholesome . religious thought make"
vagaries and delusions short lived, and
there" are always, at a given moment
more -sane persons ; in the world than
crazy ones/.
And* yet, public opinion will not grow
constantly enlightened and effective
unless we contribute our part* toward
its formation and elevation. There
will: always be need of men of the
Jerome-Folk pattern to arouse . slug
gish public opinion and to crystallize
it into effective public action.* .13 there

BEAUTIFUL
* * *~y AX FRANCISCO has possiblll
â¢ â¢ V^v *-* es * or D Â«auty that are
V*J absolutely unparalleled. Not
N">^ even Paris â co long con
** sidered a model of civic
lovelinessâ^-cari equal, in natural ad
. vfcntdijges, c thls 'city of the Golden
Â£o sars Mr. Daniel H. Burnham,
specialist In the art of reconstructing
cities, and he speaks as one knowing,
for since 1592, when he designed the
cclcbruteil Court of Honor that was
so important a feature of the Chicago
World's Fair, his time and talents "have
bren griven entirely to the question ef
municipal adornment. Â°
The National Government, having
prcrittd by his taste and Judgment,
on many occasions, both in Washing
ton and orher cities in which Federal
building* v.ere projected, had intrusted
to }lr. Burnham the formation of plans
for the reclamation of Manila, includ
: ing the establishment 0 of a new city,
Beg-uio. which is to be the summer
capital of the Philippines, and It was
just alter I, the completion of this work
that the Association ' for the .Improve
ment ,and Adornment of San Francisco
t secured his services as supervising
architect of a general outline by which
ail future action for our city's develop
ment,, shall be j?uided.
In this the association held itself to
bÂ« very- fortunate indeed, realizing
that to Mr. Burnham more than to any
other one individual are we indebted
for the spread of the doctrine that our
surroundings nfay conform to correct
esthetic standards without commercial
â¢ ;yss. o â¢
\ It is a great work that he has un
dertaken, the very scope of which
makes me wish to know more of the
personality of the man behind it. Do
= you share this interest?
J Then let me tell you how he ap
peared to me.
He haÂ». none of the impatience that
characterizes most reformers. Per
haps his practice of looking past ugly
externals to the beauty that may be
developed has made him tolerant; cer
tainly there is In his manner an en
tire absence of all attempt at dictation
or harsh .criticism.
He has a splendid head, with high,
full brow, and the Quietest, kindliest
eyes you could wish to see^ â eyes that
look at you very steadily and frankly.
His voice is low and musical, lend
ingr Itself easily to expressions of
pleasure with his experience in this
city. And he Isn't in a hurry.
Have you noticed- that It is always
the people of small affair* who are
rushed and nervous? That only those
who are "clothed with a little brief
authority" are fretful lest they be un
dÂ»resteemed? That the men who are
secure in the knowledge of their own
strength are always calm?
By every token Mr. Burnham Is one
of these last, and after meeting him
It is easy to understand his provision
that be should not he paid for ; the
work done foT vs â that it must be.en
tirely a labor of love. -
This labor is now finished. The great
plans, in many ways the most ambi
tious he has ever undertaken, are com
pleted and there Is no .fault to find
with them; his assistant. Mr. Bennett,
and the architects and draughtsmen
have done their work well.
If we consider how carefully it was un
dertaken we see that a satlefactory re
sult was most logical and sure.
High 'up the slope of Twin Peaks was
built a shingle cottage, whose many win
dows command vistas of wonderful lovell
nti-sâocean, bay, islands, the city itself
and the hills and valleys of adjoining
counties. This is the bungalpw, the tem
porary home of the artists and architects
who fora year have been carefully study
ing the problems of earth and water
Kjirtad below them.
li was Mr. Burunam's ldea^-thls etudlo
residence. He 'wanted his associates to
have thft stimulus of constant inspiration
from the panorama that was their sub-
ject. No four hours in the "morning and
four . hours In the afternoon for them!
They lived with their work, and I have
no doubt that even in their dreams
they saw vlfions of the glory that shall
yet'be ours.
1 .aek lor seme details, of the plan.
What Is to be the distinctive feature of
the new- Â£an Francisco? Immediately Is
fpt i)ffore me a map or chart the lines on
tvhicb arc more involved (I had almost
eald tang.cd) than any*other that I ever
taw. It Boon takes form, however, and
Mr. Bennett points out the location and
*cope of the changesth&t the scheme pro
yides. â¢
We start at^hc Civic Center, which is to
be located at the Junction of Van Ness
avenue and Market street. , Here; around '
ft semicircular plaza, with suitable moriu^
ments and statues, will bis grouped the
library, museum and other public build
ings, each designed . with reference: to the
other, so that In its entires the picture
may be one of harmony and beauty.
A The panhandle of /Golden , Gate Park
Js extended from' Baker j street \to this
Civic Center and Is carried on, a. broad,
handsome street, from the eastern limit
of the center to the Mail docks, cutting
Mission, Howard, Folsom and the parallel
street* diagonally and opening up a direct
way through this section of the ' South
Side. ,\u25a0\u25a0',:
Van Ness avenue is to. be_^extended
south of Market street in a % broad thor
oughfare, taking in Minna , v and Natoma
\u25a0streets for a part of their length; and con
tinuing as a widened Capp" street. It is
figured that this would easily become' the
leading retail district in4he Mission and
would prove doubly ; valuable -%& \u25a0 an irri-.
mediate connection with the Civic Center
and Yen Ness avenue on the north. Car
ried on southward, it is a dlrectdriveway
to San Mateo. r \" . â¢ " \
In selecting" the Intersection, of' Bryant,
Eleventh ana Division streets as an ideal
location. for tbe Union, depot. Mr." Burn
ham considered the convenience of i the
'traveling public and of the- railway-com
panies themselves. He has had a-partic
ularly extended experience in matters of
this sort, and in Cleveland,- Plttsbursr,
Washington and Chicago ,tha soundness
of his judgment In locating and designing
railway terminals has been fully "demon
strated; It may be noted that the South
ern Pacific*- Company- tracks already
parsthjs, point, so that. ln their case, at
least, no ; radical change would be neces
sitated by the proposed arrangement.
In order to. make the. station more ac
cessible from the Clvio Center,' Eleventh
street wlU'befwidened/ taking In'the short \u25a0
length of Minna and Natoma streets here.Â»
This stretch ' of four squares . from - the
station to Market street, would. It is*
pointed ouU^rove *n unexcelled. location .
(or commercial "-"hotels," and 'from '; the
width "of 'the; street most attractive - park
features would be possible. *
The plan of ; the i civic Center also Jcoh- â¢
templates an extension of Eleventh street ',
to the northwest f to Jefferson square ', and
the cutting of another short street/almost
parallel to Market; to thetClty Hall. '
Wheir these "changes; . are J madeâ and ;
though I: am spflakinj? of , them' so>defin-

You Â»f eel; In a . mbment,' : that :the reeom-

and wise,- and practicable.
i He. has "looked into the future, far Â«j
human eye 'can see," and for tho popula
tion of two millions to. 'which this com
munity will reasonably Increase â¢within.
â¢ anoth*r. fifty, ycara,, he haa arranssd not
â¢ only a plan of parks and boulevard* of
-t>i*rpassins loveliness, but he has) consid
ered the expandlns of the "business dis
trict so that the city's*, affaire may be ad
ministered without friction and with a
minimum of effort; so that the irreat ar
teries of trade 'may be saved tha con
gestion that already threatens.
Such a man Is conservative; lilj en
thusiasms do not entry him away. That
is why everythlns he says has weight and
when. he: tells us that San Francisco has
"an opportunity to become the moat beau
tiful city of modern times weÂ» believe
him absolutely, and every public spirited
man and woman want* to have aoma
active share In tha grtat work of realiz
ing the Ideal.
"It will not do any. good to quarrel with
the early builders of the city."" Mr. Burn
ham is . saying." "for not starting right.
They could not dream that the Uttie vil
lage would so soon become *a gTeat me
tropolis. They were gathered together in
I the .name of business, and it had cot thÂ«Ji
been pointed out that business blocks and
business, streets can be beautiful as well
as useful, that men. and women work to
better advantage under conditions that
' satisfy their esthetic sense and that pleas
ant parks and recreation places are as
important to a community as Us build*
ings." -
Of course, there were always a few f&r
tighted citizens who felt the beauty of
the city's location and urged that some
concerted effort be made to improve It.
At onÂ« time the Municipal Council took
ofik-ial steps ' to determine what it was
good to do, and Frederick Law Olmstad.
the elder. was a authorized to prepare plans
for a. system* of parks and drives. His
recommendations, filed forty years agn,
were favorably received, but for some
reason they were not carried out and tbe
city continued to follpw Its own devices In
the matter of direction and form of
growth. . .
We have already entered upon a new
day. Gradually some of the crooked ways
will be made straight, and If the Super
visors consult and folldw the Burnham
report in legislating upon the matters of
which it treats the future will show fewer
mistakes to be corrected. BSSB
It seems 'sordid to discuss the Â»eost of
the work of beauty that has been out
lined, but it.Js very necessary, none the
less, and I finally venture to put the
question.
"We have sought to minimize the. ex
pense' as . much as possible," replies , Mr.
Burnham. "It has not been our purpose
to correct every mistake that was ever
made in the city's building, and while
JIOOjOOO.OOO Is a great deal of money. It Is
not all to be spent at once. Even If our
plan Is followed It will probably not be
realized for ICO years, so you see at no
time will the burden of cost bo great."
\u25a0 "Is there no chance," I wonder, "that In
years, to come the plan may be changed
to conform to other Ideas?"
"Not In Its essentials, for a great design
like this is based upon the logic of the sit'
uation. It Is not my Idea, nor the idea of
any of the landscape designers who have
â¢worked upon it, except in so far as* we
have Interpreted the conditions here. In
landscape architecture, as In everything
else, these* Is one best plan, one arrange
ment that Is logically correct. If our sug
gestions are right to-day they will be Just
as* right In years to come. They are based
jpon the . topography of the , country.
.Vhy, In Paris* to-day they are building
new parks, new driveways, as outlined By
Baron Haussraan 'more than fifty year 3
ago. ' The modern city was constructed
along the- lines -he laid down hj 1853-52.
Then for a time his^ plans were not fol
lowed; but they, have" been readopted as a.
.guide., time having served only to prove
their wisdom.'
"Another example of the same thing ta
xfforded by oar own capital. When the
recently appointed : commission, of wh!sh
I was ft member, studied conditions thÂ«rÂ«.
It 'determined . upon a restoration of tho

IN a dark jungle of prejudice there
once lived a harsh, facetious young
mun named Ralph Rankln. .
In mind he was not naturally dull
or illiberal, but an association of
thirty years with gentle women who loved
being cowed had imposed upon him such
a respect for the arbitrary and the
crabbed as one might, according to tra
dition, gain from residence among pirates.
Jn hoCy he was tall, with a long face,
pointed jaw and some distinction of bear
ing. .
In estate, he possessed a slight fortune,
inherited from his father, and a stone
front house in a rented row on the north
tide.
His fortune he intended to increase by
law practice, and for such a purpose he
read books of jurisprudence all day In
the office of an elderly attorney. His
house he inhabited. It was a place of
harmonious rooms, in dark, unvarnished
woods and excellent shades of Whatman,
hung with a few well-selected pictures,
and bordered by law book cases.
Ralph professed a passion lor the mod
ern, patronized realistic fiction and sym- -
bolic drama and attended clubs and sob
rieties where radical ideas were voiced
with freedom and good sense.
/Whiie oytwardly he followed these pur
suit?, so enlightened, broadening and
humane, inwardly he, had developed a
violent and gay temperament, large. It*
is true, but rough and overbearing. \u25a0 .
By this time he unconsciously kept in
a state of tutelage unknown to the sav
age wpman h!s aunt and his young
orphan sister, Ellen.
Ellen was a pretty and quiet but mean
minded girl, who found an unhealthy â¢
comfort in "being devoted though ill
treated,. She encouraged grumbling about
small 'domestic misfortunes like burnt
biscuits by an air of meek guilt How
ever'much she disagreed, when Ralph'
said such things . as that a man who
would wear lan shoes in the evening
would make good gun food, that after
he heard a person split his Infinitive he
. never spoke to him again, and that good
' Romanticists were dead Romanticists, she
would only smile and shake her head
fondly.
This was partly from her love of being j
oppressed, and partly because she derived
that delight from hearing her. brother
damning r:ght and left without regard
to reason or the truth what other mild
natures derive frpm melodrama and the
dime novel.
As to her own bearing. It was one of "
"the utmost caution and tentativeness. To
her the world was made VP of .people of
superior sophistication going about seek
. ing whom they might devour. She often
eat, silent for whole' evenings from, a
geuersJ vague fear of committing some
unforgettable outrage before inese per
eons. She spent almost all her time in
thinking about such things as whether it
would be better form to wear her small
hat or to wear her large one to the
Thomas concerts. \ ' . . \u25a0\u0084 \u25a0*'*' w
This sensitiveness was not . from any.
misfortune In the girl's personal appear
ance. She was a graceful little creature, ;
beautifully made.' with large.; :: f awn-like
eyes, pale-bro wn hair. \u25a0a' passionless " ex
presbicn, and a very clear white coloring.
The two orphans had a slight acquaint- !
*nee with a girl named Regina yon Hel
ler, In whose presence Ellie appeared as
the tnowdrop beside the cardinal flower.
- Regina was a girl of Impulsive, hasty.
manners and Austrian parentage.
She had a mobile face, a flashing color
\u25a0 Â«.nd a curved, rather scornful mouth. She
- carried her head high above her beauti
ful shoulders and bust, and In her most
ellngy and care-free movements preserved
c certain erectness.
Madame yon Heller, her mother, a thin
little noblewoman with a watenall and a
. black silk apron, taught German, French
and penmanship in schools and In private
classes attended by Ellie. \u0084â¢,.
The poor lady had eloped in her senti
mental middle age from Vienna with her
c music master, a tall Pole, with fin
gers, excited eyes and a dyed purple mus
tache.
. He supported her very illy by tuition
at girls' schools on the Continent and
5 In New York, where he died.
* In thes* various academies and con
rents of her parents' classes Regina had
been somewhat ecrapplly educated till
her mother came to Chicago. : -l.??J'.
Here there had been offered to Madame
, Heller & position where she taught the
branches above mentioned in a quiet,
plausible, ladylike manner, unlllumined
by a ray of Intelligence. She played ac-'
compaciments also and gave a. few muslo
lessons in the same harmlets and digni
fied way. 1<Â» ; ;
By this means she managed to support
herself and her daughter, in rooms of
their own, on a Email, crooked German
street, to send Regina to one of the best
masters in the city for singing, and to
keep her at the school where she herself
offered instruction. .
On a cold winter evening 1 " Regina stop
ped for a few minutes at the Rankln
bouse to deliver an exercise to Ellie.
On this occasion Ralph cams across
her in the hail.
"Who is your friend the grenadier?" he
s&ld to Ellle afterward. Regina had
worn a email fur cap.
"Her mother teaches that French class
Miss Vanderbank got up," said Ellie.
"Heavens, heavens," said Ralph. *'A
gfrPwho will wear a sealskin cap is worse
than Impossible." * *
\u25a0Ellle could not help knowing there was
more to Regina than the fact of her
\u25a0wearing a sealskin cap. But \u25a0 she would
not have dreamed of uttering a word in
opposition.
In this manner Ralph roamed deeper
and deeper Into the jungle and might,
perhaps, have been' there forever lost If
he had not been startled from the thicket
by an uncommon incident. â¢
On a rainy spring evening Regina yon
Heller was sitting by an open window
on the second story, close over the street,
looking out at the darkness by the blow-
Ins liÂ«nt of a gas lamp.
The water splashed heavily, darken
ing: the wooden sidewalks, streaking
the shadowy red-brick and . brown
frame' fronts and the lapped shingles
of the inclosed place.
At ter, a close day the rain dropped
through â¢ the air a fine chill the girl
waited long to enjoy.
While she was sitting half-asleep,
with' the fresh wind blowing In her
'face.' a voice ebouted, "Help! Help!"
There was a sound ; of . something
clattering and' falling. Shots \u25a0 cracked
and a man with -his hat .knocked over
his eyei ran - past V down .the" street; ,
while a neighbor, : a \u25a0! Mr. Ostermann,
dressed In trousers amd a .nightshirt
open at the throat, rushed . ponderously
out of his house, and stood shouting,
"Robbers! Murder! Police!" in '-al-V
most sobbing tones. ...... â¢ .. ; : "
Regina threw a. little old Roman
striped shawl over her shoulders,
slipped down stairs without wakening
Mme. yon Heller, and ran out into the
rain. ' " ; \u25a0 . f
At the same moment two men came,
plunging down: the- street, 'a^ young re
porter, and Ralph Rankin. .V-i .'
They were returning . late â¢ from the
theater. The ; Clark-street \u25a0 line was
blocked and Ifrom; the -platform -of
Wells-street car they had heard the .
shots and Mr. Ostermann's cries.'' The
reporter always \u25a0. dashed > to â¢ any scene
of excitement and Ralph could hardly
do less than accompany him. '/ /
"Where did they go? Which way?.
Are you hurt?" they exclaimed ', to '\u25a0 Mr.'
Ostermann, still moaning loudly, ;VHelp!
Help!" and apparently unable to make
canye any intelligible or coherent reply.
"There, that way, down," Regina
called, pointing the unknown rescuers
dramatically ' toward the end of" the
street
Realizing the hopelessness of inter
course with Mr: Oslermann they crossed
to her.
. "Is any one shot? Was any one really
-hurt?" asked the reporter, as Ralph 'and ,'
â¢Regina hastily recognized .one; ariothen
*'Oh, no. No. Go at once," said Regina.'*
She had no knowledge ; at ; all â¢ whether
what she was saving was true, only an .\u25a0
unreasoning sense that .t he man with his'
. hat ' knocked over his ; eyes expected \ to
be chased. She pointed again toward the

She embraced Regina.
; Within a few minutes she was sitting
quietly at the table, correcting German
lessons In perfect* calm with a small gold
pen presented by a pupil.
'. She was entirely appeased when on the
following day Ralph, meeting her as she
dispersed her French class In his parlor,
seemed to 'address her with the utmost
respect, and to show no disposition to re
fer, to the low episode of theOstermanns
and their thieves.
The truth is -that 'having once dashed
from, the wilderness at this outer cry
Ralph was refreshed by his adventure.
He had been charmed, with th*e street,
charmed with the rainy spring 'evening.
He liked to have the neighbors the
policemen trooping about as though they
were in comic opera, and Regina Bitting
.talking beside him, her hair sparkling
with the rain and her face eager and ex
cited.
When hÂ« saw her again in her sealskin
cap and .fur-lined circular at a.musicale
in the rooms of her master, an excellent
artist, her appearance seemed to him one
of high . romantic "distinction.
Mr. Lowski, a man of the world as well
as an excellent , artist, was* a good friend
of Ralph's and after, this the young man
sometimes \visUed him when Miss yon

and /Ellie, v saying, ."I 'saw your frieHd,
Miss yon Heller, ; to-day." But to im

person" capable of craning from a window
to .see a neighborhood scrimmage would
so have shaken the foundation- of these

He told Regina about a hundred in
significant things, seeming wonder
ful to. her. sometimes so remote from
her expediences. Sometimes he read
her poetry she considered beautiful
beyond the dreams of angels and some
times teased her by making such re
marks as that 'there was nothing bat
dagoes \u25a0In "Paolo and Francesca^" and
he had always supposed "The Intruder"
was a bill collector. But more often
he appeared In the character she in
stinctively accredited him with, that of
a man fearless of marauders and pub
lic opinion alike, and extremely open
minded. Such a man he really was in
her presence.
It has been said that Mr. Bankia, it
harsh and heady, was large; and his
size may perhaps be best indicated by
his - appreciation 'of Regina. This, at
first the sheerest caprice, and excep
tlon'of his fancy, came,, after a winter
in the presence of her enthusiasm,
pride and beauty, to be one of the mo3t
profound Impressions of his nature, a
passion and a conviction.
The very unworldliness that once
had seemed to him a mere ludicrous
blight now appeared endearing, a di
-verslon, and sometimes touching beyond
expression.

"unconscious and noble In the girl-â
her bearing, her sympathies^ her ideas
â that swept him like a cool wind. â¢
More and more this came to be the

less, aroused general contempt and in

Mme. yon "Heller wept and shook her
head for hours over the serious turn
the affair had taken. She was espe
cially depressed after she learned that
Ralph's father had made his fortune
in the flour business. She repeated
again and again that it wa*S because
they were poor and alone In the world
that Regina accepted the hand of a
tradesman. However, she soon came
around. In fact, she wa3 not, a little
consoled by the prospect of leading a
-single life. She had been always by
nature, if not by condition, a spinster;
and she now eagerly refused Ralph's
eager entreaties that she 'remain with
her daughter.
The -thought of having a small room
and parlor of her own alone with her
black silk apron and gold pen. at Hiss
â¢ - -
Tyson's, without the perturbing presence,
of Regina,. had high attractions for her.
The aunt and Ellie made a far more
terrific scene than Mme. yon Heller. They
said* nothing at all. Nor did they shed a
'tear in - Ralph's presence. They merely
kissed him good. night, as though be had
blasted ; their dearest hopes: and. . when
they visited Regtna. addressed her In a
tone of quiet endurance more pinching to
Ralph than curses.
The poor fellow himself behaved In the
most generous and unresentful manner

subjected him, and endured with humor

ELIZABETH AMES
THIS year all <ryes have beeii turned
toward Japan; and the world has
been astonished at the progress Â«nd
the BcV.ievcments of this seemingly
new nation. The war that she has
so successfulJy waged with Russia, has
brought into prominence the tremendous
strides she has been making during ,tne
last c !:alf century, not only in the science
cf war, but in many other ways besides.
However, all this is now familiar -.to
â¢very one. and astonishment has been
replaced by respect.
Although I have never been lucky
enough to take even a trip to Japan, yet
I know that It is said to be a. country full
cf romance, poetry and art- Here in San
Francisco we; are more or less familiar
\u25a0with Japanese art. Their paintings'are to t
bÂ« seen in their shops in: ; th^ city, and
occasionally there are loan exhibitions of
the finer- examples .of Japanese art.
There was a particularly interesting exhi
bition a few years ago at the Bohemian
OlubV'.where some of ;this best collections
in- thÂ©.- country were shown.
\u25a0: But.wtien we come to their art of mu
elc.lt Is more difficult to understand than
Its sister art of palatlrsg. There may be
c few people who really appreciate and
â¢;Â«njcy, Japanese music, but their number
very small, and confined closely
to-: those \rho have given long and con
tentious study to It. A great' deal of
Japanese music Is founded on religious
thought and conceptions* and also on
mythological stories and legends, and to~
understand it one must know the founda
tions of it. -^Y-i' <&'?Â»Â£Â£
One of these romantic -myths has seemed
\u25a0:?Â© interesting to lose, and so I am going
r^rtiate it right here to show the reliance
w hlch. the Japanese place in the power of
.r^ustc. The j story runs that Amaterasu.
the goddess of the s sun. had concealed
,1 -erself An some dark cave, so that her
":ght was, apparently to be hidden from
the world forever. There Was great sorrow
fixating all the deities, who flocked to this
taouthof the cave, .praying and entreat
\u25a0.;;\u25a0.Â£.-.'the beautiful goddess of the sun to
:*rurn Ito her dominion and to shed her"
Wight ; a gain wKhin its borders. But the
goddess 'was hot to be moved, and the
/prayers seemed to fail. At last one of
."-the geds. wiser than, the others, took six
VcuigÂ°.t>ows and bound them together and
/fcfgan \u25a0 .gently, to twang the strings.
The . *w*>ct sounds penetrated into the
cave u'nd the beautiful Ame-No-Uzume,
her liair. bound up with vines, came forth,
holding in one hand t binder of bamboo
â¢and in tbe other a halberd.
â¢.Gradually the music, which the wisa
god .continued to play, had its effect on
Ame^No-t'tume until she began to wave
\u25a0; her bamboo branches to and fro. keeping
t!me with the rr.psle, aue at last- to gen
:-t>Â«v':sm-ay'.her body in rhythm^ and then
i^ /began to sing and to "ask. with great
yfenity. if her charms were hot greater
â¢' : :t;feÂ£tiv<hose of any others. But the gods
laughed and made meny.
: : Bui the sun goddess heard, her curios
ity; > ; a? aroused "and she. slowly came
; forth -from the cave and the light "of the
sx3u fchone again on the world. The gods
-,:ihÂ«n covered the mouth of the cave with
a tragic mirror. typifying purity, so that
tbe light could never again be taken awa^T
from the world.
- TliiÃ myth seemed Â«to me very pretty
; and . romantic and it seemed intended to
introduce the art of music' to their world.
[ The poetry and rhythm of music were,
shown in this little story as having a
(harm that was powerful even among the
gods .themselves, and it makes it impos
sible', to doubt that the Japanese music,
however singular it. may sound to our
unaccustomed cars, has rcai. iu:in auJ
beauty. \u25a0". â¢. ".
i have been interested for' come time in
'Japanese music, though not yet able to
Jndcrstand it, of course, and when I learn
ed that Mr. Bowie of San Matea had a
fine collection of Japanese musical instru* \u25a0
nicnts'l hati a great desire to see them." *â¢."
They are .very beautiful, the finest, no
a6ubt, c to.be seen in California, or..per
.haps in this country, and full of romantic
interest./ Some of the finest of these In-"
struxnents are more tnan 200 years pld and
are magnificent- specimens. But ; before
entering upon a description of these ln
Â«ruments it is desirable to say a little
ifemething of the rouslc'ltself.
. The original Instruments known to the-
Japanese, were only four. All the others
xi ere Introduced from China, but they
have been modified andÂ° improved by the
Japanese. *.
The overwhelming influence of China
in those early days was so great as to
practically overshadow everything that
was original "with the Japanese, but the
'p.-irsts 'were, faithful to tnelr kcto. and
managed to preserve the national music.
Even to this day the old music has kept
its place by means of inheritance and
tradition. Indeed, It is quite remarkable
how many of the old customs are pre
served in Japan in thts way. But the his
tory of Japanese music is so bound up
with th<? history of its theater, its dances,
its -religion, "and with the influence of
Chinas that the whole subject would be
much' too complicated a one to under
take.
We can. theieforc, only look into the
modern music of Japan and endeavor to
sree what it is like.
The purest modern Japanese music Is
which is given |by an instrument
called the koto. The koto Is one of the
original Japanese instruments, and Is
uninfluenced by Chinese contact. Some
of the music, on this instrument is quite
â¢"jellfciiiie to us. and to my mind, very
Quaint and pretty. But that is by no
means always tiie case with the songs.
"Many of the popular songs, thote that
are sung on tbe c streets, can really be
quite easily retained in our ', memories,
but there are others where it seems Im
possible to catch the thread.
The Japanese idea of accent in some
what vague, according to our ideas, but
their music seems to be. built upon a reg
ular scheme- of C-4 time, and the music
plipil lias t,o learn his time well, before
anything elesc, just as it has to be
\u25a0>arned nere.
, Japanese music Jiag its * classical' as
well as Its popular' numbers. , Tbejjclas
tical music has two formsâ the "dan"
and the "kuml." The former is music .
without singfng-"8ongs .without words"
-and is taken from leading themes and
tiecomes more and more complex.
The "kumr. are songs with very elabo
rate accompaniment's, . and are built on
:Kem*s varying with the verses of the
Wm.. not unlike our familiar "air and
v ariatlorre." These songs have regular
Uars.-aml ar* Â«i\ided. into eight bar sec
ions, and. although* thsreis a fixed time
to the bars. It is hard for our. ears to
:atch exactly, their beat, j
One of their famous instruments is
:alled the. \*bi\ya." an'; Instrument that
was irrvjjortcd into Japan from; China
n. the. beginning- of the tenth 'century.
Phis Instrument * holds "an important
jlace in the development of Japanese
VÂ»UBic
There, are several kinds of "biwa." in
je& in Japan to-day, suÂ£h as thÂ« buzaku
biwa, the Satsuma biwa and the Chi
nese blwa. * ; '
:Mr. Bowie nllowed me to photograph
a verj'. beautiful blwa that is in, his
collection.* It is a /Satsuma biwa and is
two or three hundred years old. It was
picked up in an old curiosity shop in
Kioto by Mf. Bowie himselr.
'-This Instrument is a remarkably. fine
specimen of lacquer work. The body
of it Is made of the most beautiful
mulberry, finely polished, 'and 'the front
part is ornamented with elaborate
larquer work. The design Is a peacock,
with tail spread, and graceful chrysan
themums. The colors are beautifulfand
mother-of-pearl is set In for the "eyes'
in the peacock's (tail. â¢
The lacquer is so soft in tone as 1 to
resemble, embossed leather.
There arc four Btringrs on this "biwa,"
which are fastened ' at \u25a0 the base, with'
quite a larse holder, standing clear of
the body v of the instrument except at
the lower, cud.. As the strings pass over
the frets they come gradually closur
together and finally meet in an ebony
notch at the top of the neck, which
comes down at right angles to the body.
The koto is, however, the favorite in
strument In the lan<l of the cherry bids
i=oin, and tlÂ»Â«rÂ« are regular music
schools for teaching It.
In .i very Interesting article on Japan
â¢which I hnve read recently there is a

cinating to watch him.* We carried our

to admire the Japanese gate, which is tha
work of a Japanese carpenter. It Is a
massive gatei but at tha asma tlma
graceful. The car, ings' on the fence ara

gate one enters at once a quaint and at

Furnishing the Home - Bedchambers
By Mary E. Carter
Copyright. 1303. by A. S. Bafnes A. Co.
ALTHOUGH not always possible,
it is very desirable that every
one should have a separate room
with absolute privacy at times
when it is wished for. People are bet
ter for being alone with their own
thoughts sometimes and thus enabled
to shake off the hypnotic effect of the
suggestion, conscious or unconscious,
of others to which all of us are ex
posed through association. Only by
getting away Trom people â however, dear
irtey may -toeâ can one recover lost equi
librium and reassert one's own individ
uality. Therefore provisions should al
ways be made whereby those who are
compelled to room together may secure
at least Eome degree of privacy every
day. Very young people are gregarious
in their taste and do not as a rule mind
rooming together", but all. as they grow
older, realize the comfort and the ad
vantage of some assured privacy. Young
persons ought not to be compelled to
room with their elders, because the
tastes and Inclinations . of older people
are so different from those of their
juniors that the younger ones disturb
their elders and the elder' are uncon
genial to the younger, as a natural re
isult they act and react unfavorably
upon each other.
A double room should be furnished
v.ith two of everything in the way of
important bedroom â¢ furniture, each-oc
cupant having an Individual bed. dress
inp bureau, waghstand; writing desk, or
table, and screen of light weight, to
be used around the washstand. bed or.
desk, as the owner may. choose. In a
room thus furnished two reasonable
people can get along usually without se
riously incommoding each other, pro
vided both are equally cleanly and tidy
about their persons and the room, and
can agree with regard to ventilation by
nfirtit and by day. But one. who loves,
order, ba thins and abundant . fresh air

force of habit. I believe the abhor
rent tin-pail has never been adopted;
by school children of really "nice"
families. There arquf or sale in ââ¢' \
partment stores neat luncheon bas
kets fitted up . with holders for
spoons, forks and plates, and re
sembling in exterior the hampers
used for sending flowers and fruit
to friends. A later fad,' and one
which promises to crowd the basket
cut of market, is the morocco or
Jeatheroid case, with a hinged top
and strap, and, if one wishes it,
lock and. ke3\ Personally, I think
the .basket the more graceful recep
tacle of the two for our schoolboy's
luncheon.- Thfs is, however, a mat
ter of individual preference. '
Basket or box should be lined with
a clean napkin, and a second, fold- ,
cd, be laid upon the top of lunch
eon. Have a dozen of these napkins
hemmed, â¢ not fringed, marked with
the boy's ,na; 3 and set apart for his
use alone. He is at heart a savage,
Â«nd you, as his mother, cannot af
ford to omit one of the small, num-.
berlcss refining agencies which will
keep* savagery down and assist in
the evolution of the gentleman. The
napkin with his name on it may
hinder him from wiping greasy and
sticky fingers upon his trousers.
Furthermore, it is one of the things
which shows the "other fellows"
\u25a0what 'sort of people" Our Boy's fam
ily are, and how he lives at home.
LUNCH-BOX SURPBISES
a Let the contents of the basket
carry out the scheme of. which the
napkin, clean and glossy, is the key
note. Do'not grudge the time it will
take to wrap his sandwiches in tis
sue paper and to envelop hard-boil
ed or stuffed eggs in the same. If
the ends .of these envelopes be
fringed, so much' the better for. the
development of "refinement in Kirn,
and the reflex influence upon the
"other fellows." An odd half hour in'
afternoon or evening may be profit
ably employed in cutting out and
should never be doomed to intimate as
sociation with another of opposite .in
clinations. Each one will make life a
burden to the other. . "â¢

The Symptoms, Care, Diet and Remedies
Which Apply, to the Malady
Dr. Emelyn L. Coolidge
Copyright. 1305. by A. S. Barnes & Co. \u25a0
WHOOPING cough Is more like
ly to be contracted by young
Infants than almost any other
contagious disease. .It is
thought to be more prevalent during the
ffprisg months than at other seasons of
the year. -
â¢If the baby has been exposed to
whooping cough and he is going to
contract the disease, he will probably
<So so within three weeks after the ex
posure. It visually begins like an or
dinary cold, with a cough, this stage
lasting one wtek or ten days. Then
the .second or paroxysmal stage begins;
the child will have a series of 'short
coughs, then a long-drawn inspiration,
with the peculiar sound called the
"whoop." In young Infants the "whoop"
is entirely absent at times.
During the attacks of coughing the in
fant will generally become very red or
even black in the face, and frequently
will vomit at the close of the attack. In
the case of babies, this vomiting is the
most serious thing about whooping
cough, for It is difficult to make them re
tain sufficient nourishment to keep them
from growing weak and thin. It is a
good plan to feed the child- a little
stronger food, and less of it, every two
'hours; be will then have a chance to
absorb at least a little of the nourish
ment between the attacks and will not
â¢be quite so ept to vomit as if a larger
amount of the food were given. If the
thlld is much prostrated and the at
tacks are very frequent.- even this two
hour Interval need not be rigidly ad
hered to. but a little food given at the
close cf each attack, otherwise thÂ«re
may be danger of a collapse from insuf
ficient nourishment.
Some form of beef extract or liquid
peptonoids should also be given between
feedings, as the nourishment and stim
ulation exerted by these are really
seeded. If there are t-igr.e of indigestion.
It is a cood plan to" peptonize the food,
for a time, at least.
Druss taken Internally do not often
belp the child very much, and frequently
upset the digestion i they should al
ways be prescribed by a physician, if
given at all.
A small lamp especially made for the
purpose," end which vaporizes a medi
cated <rtuid, is excellent to keep burn
ing \u25a0 in the room, especially at night.
on bright days the baby may go out
of doors, but 6 should be kept away
from other children.
After two wcckii tbÂ« paroxysms are
cenerally lees severe and less frequent,
but the cough will of tun continue to
some degree from* three to five months.
Sometimes a change of 'air- will belb to
shorten the disease. If the child can be
taken away, cbwsv. the- mountains or
inland country, rather than the sea
shore.
If the baby vomits on hls_clothing
or on the floor, disinfect - the articles
with a solution of j carbolic acid one
part and water f6rty parts. :
"While the germ of whooping cough
does not remain in the roomÂ«as long as
that of scarlet 'fever, it is well at the
close of the disease to fumigate the
clothing and room in which the child
has spent most of his time and slept.
Either sulphur candles or formaline
pastilles are the simplest to use for
fumigation. for use will
come with them; but if sulphur is
used, be sure to have, plenty of water
about. Hang several wet sheets about
the room; sprinkle water on the floor,
and let some stand about in open ves
sels. Be sure all the cracks of doors
and .windows are tightly, stopped; up
with cotton, and if there- is a fireplace
or register In the room , paste large,
thick pieces of paper over it. * Leave* the
room closed for ten or twelve" hours,
then open it, and air thoroughly for
clx or eight hours more. Wipe off all
the furniture, pictures, etc., .' with >a
damp cloth, which has been wrung out.
of the above-named solution of carbolic
acid. . ..;. .-*-..
USES FOR MAGAZINES
WHAT becomes of 'your magazines
and papers when you are through
with them? /They're worth pass
â¢ ing on to some one -else. 'and" it
takes only a little time and trouble to
do them up for mailing.
I erhaps there's some one sick who
would like them; or some one with in
tense craving to know what is going on
in tne world of science and literature
and art. but, who hasn't the necessary
wherewithal: to indulge that taste. At
such a little cost to you, that other's de-,
sire can be gratified.
â¢ As to hospitals and homes, there is a
score of such places where such things
are veritable gocsends; and in your own
home they only accumulate until, Jn Belf
defense, you. dump; them out, and -even
burn* them.
Yet when. somebody wants them, have
you the right to waste them that way?
One girl, s whose magazines get passed
along month by. nonth.as she finishes
them, goesa: step further. She has what
she .calls ay/lending she!f" in her book
case, where the =. lightest., cheeriest
booksâ the. thoroughly wholesome'kind
are stored.* Every invalid she. hears of,
who is well enoush to read, or to be read
to. has oneJof these books Â«ent c to her,
with a little '-npte,*'asklns;her \u25a0 to \ return . :
It when she has read it.-.
She takes bn<u wise' precaution' against
other people's Vforgctfulness/Vand that
is. to stick a little slip^of paper (with
the name of the person to -whom, she has.
ieut the, book, written . plainly >\u25a0 on) into
the space on her, shelf, which marks 'the
place - the book fwas," taken from." "That
slip acts oh a tracer 'whenever 'a book
doesn't come -back I oh/- tlm*;. and as she
always only, aKkj â¢ fprJ 1 I : when some one
else is ill, \u25a0 nobody js 'insulted; as forget
ful people, strangely tmough, often- are.
Nothing sad. nothing "deep," nothing
too exciting is allowed on that shelf, and
yet it p is -filled with books interesting,
enough to hold a tired attention without
wearing on nerves.""" â¢

never, made any money before : in her
life. She took her . grandmother's loom
from the attic or her home, and a dear
old lady in the neighborhood taught her
how to. handle' it. : She said she had used
up all j the -old clothes the family had,
and' was then buying pretty calicoes and
bright-colored. cottpn .fabrics to fill or
der^ ; ; on hand.--; Several years ago she
Htarted. % witb one loom and herself as
one workir.-iNow she has several looms,
â¢ with a girl for "each one. The shuttles
are"*thrown by hand; consequently, the
carpet's, made are. only a/ yard In width.
There fare /places ' where a double-width

is heavier work;/ . and . requires * strong

BETWEEN balls and- dances Is a
'.distinction without ; much 1 differ
ence. A ball is always a large and
formal affair,' while a dance can
be anything from' the impromptu gath
ering together of a dozen Jolly young
people to an elaborate "function that in
elegance of - appointments fully equals
the first-mentioned ffestlvity.
\u25a0The invitations to a ball should always
be engraved. . They should be sent out
from ten. days to three weeks in advance
of, the date, the rule ; in .this, matter be
ing: the bigger and more ..elaborate the
ball/^the longer the notice given.
; , INVITATIONS TO DANCES
On an invitation to a private, house
the word "ball" â¢is never used, but
"dancing" or !'cotilloh" is invariably
put In one corner of the card. The
very latest -fashion is to have ball or
formal dance 'invitations engraved on a
white card with a blank space, : so that
the hostess can write in the name of
the; guest to whom, the invitation is to
be sent.. : Such v an engraved invitation
would read:
.'Sirs. John : Mohtmorericy
- ':) requests "the pleasure of
company oh Thursday evening,
February thÂ« 9th." at 10 o'clock
; Dancing \ ; 7008 North Broadway
Although the above form is consid
ered rather the smartest^. Invitations
without the blank for the written name
and having Instead the word "your"
engraved upon' the -card are used to a
great exteri t, . ar.2 zre in " perfectly " good
taste. "' ln this .case,; the'lnvltation would

The^correct form 'for answering these
ihyitaUons , has . been 'already;' given In

qiietie ,14 1 about 'the same, as at "biy;

all' oar* great 'cities younsf girls in, fash

Coil's Weekly Cartoon on American Sodery
tend public balls unless accompanied by
a chaperon.
At all balls and dances In bis cities,
even when given by people of moderat*
means* an awning and carpet extend
across the sidewalk from the street to
the house door.Â° If.it is a very cere
monious occasion, a man in livery is
stationed on the curb to open the car
riage doors. Thla aw:. lns. carpet and
man. ln attendance can all be hired for
the evening, so the expense Is not very
heavy, all things considered. At . balls
given In suburban or country houses
surrounded . by grounds an awning and
carpet to the street would be out of thÂ»
question, but as these houses are usu
ally furnished with a porte-cochere or
some' sort of- a covered -piazza where
the guests may alight, their abse.ncÂ«
causes no inconvenience. ." \u25a0"-â¢-.
.The house door is opened by the but
ler, or, maid. If no man . is kept, who
directs the guests to. the cloak .roomâ
the spare bedrooms or some of; the fam
ily rooms being especially arranged for
this purpose. In the dressing .room for
the ladles a maid should be In attend
ance to help remove cloaks, take off
overshoes,' adjust sashes, or any little
attention that the feminine guests may
require. And if the' dance Is a very
large affair. It is well to have checks
for all garments, so that no confusion
will result when the guests depart. The
gentlemen's cloak room is also provided
with the services of a man who checks
the. coat- and hat of each: masculine
guest. Here also â¢ are often placed
cigars, cigarettes and mineral waters
when the house contains no smoking
room.
When dance programmes are used th<Â»
guests either. find them in the dressing
room,: piled la a tray in the hall. 'or
offered the dancers by a servant, lust
before they enter the ball room doorl

marks oÂ£ exalted favor she has already
received have tilled not a few.of'her
equally ambitious countrywomen , with
envy, she is 'paving the way for. future
triumphfe. An Incident that occurred
recentJy shews how quick she .is to
eeize a chance. â¢ *. .
Sue was present at a polo match
which was. played near London. Prince
â¢"Eddie." as he is familiarly calledâ the
Prince t)f Wales' eldest boyâ was there
too. He watched tke progress of the
jrarae with great enthusiasm, ahS ex
pressed particular admiration for one
of the ponies. .It happened to be one
belonging to^Mrs. ilackey, which she
had lent to an, American friend for, the
day. When she heard of the notice her
pony , had -attracted; she" s , wrote at once
to Marlborcugh House to inquire, If the
royal youngster would be "graciously
pleased" to accept" the pony as a* gift.
In the reply wruch .she received it was
pointed out thai, the boy would not be
old enough to.pfay polo for some years,
aiid.it was suggested that it would be
a pity to withdraw, the animal from the
grame merely to gratify the young
Prince's enthusiasm.
That left Mrs. "Mackey free to. adopt
what course shepleased inthe matter.
She Immediately sent the pony to.Sand-^
ringham, 'where the Princess of Wales
, was then staying with her family."
Healing that the Duchess of Newcastle
had a number of j polo pony foals for
tile, Mrs. .Mackey purchased two, of the
best of - them rind also sent, them to
*Baodrtngham, for tfie young Prince".

any other State, arid that efforts were
being made to erfect an improvement by,
training, teachers, and , then sending
them out to train others. . In June. 1903.
I wrote to the principal of a college in.

who answered the question.
HOW. jIOXEY, WILL. BE t RAISED.
\ "So far as the Society of American
Women in - London' Is concerned," , she
said, "we can of course do comparative
ly little. The scheme .will be sub
mitted to. the forthcoming " conference
of the General Federation, of Women's
Clubs, which meets next. May. Started
only, fifteen years .ago. while I was
president of that New York mother ot
clubsâ Sorosis â the , ;! federation- has
grown 'arid developed In 'a marvelous
fashion. Speaking of j the federation
necessity.. Jesiah ; Strong, president of
the American Institute of Social
Science, said: "Excepting the United
States Congress, I know of no body of
men -or - women - representing so much
of intellect arid heart, so much of cul
ture arid so much of the highest hopes
and noblest possibilities of the Ameri
can people.*
.. "It.would be dffHcult to set a limit
to v what an. army of women of that
kind, now 700,000 strong, could accom
plish. We hope and , expect that the
central 'education committee of the
General Federation will, recommend i?
to .the State federations,, which will
then undertake the task of raising the
moneyâ each of the federated clubs
working for the State to which it be
longs. In that way I have not the
slightest doubt that the money could be
easily raised by women for. women.
1 The Society of American Women in
London has only 150 members, none of
them millionaires, but we are not go
ing to content ourselves with merely
asking others to raise money. We^ex
â¢pect to contribute something more than
what would be a fair share for us to
the endowment fund. We s ha" 11 try to
raise the money for a student from.* the
District of -oiumbia. We propose that
all the women students set. over under
'the scheme should be received as hon
orary " members .of our society,' and
generally we shall do our best to make
them feel at home and facilitate their
studies, in every possible way."

This lodge has. in. lth.e_pa,st two years
taken on a- great, dear of activity, 'and
during the present term has made:re
markable progress In a, fraternal way-
Much of this is due to the 'individual

when Jacky shoots lirinthorpe in Sun
cay's presence. Hardly a word is spok

.\vt there is all of horror and fear in the
v-jde-eyed face. In the slim, bowed fig

pletely Justified of her theory, here
where so easjly raw melodrama might
be *nade. Later, where Sunday says

altogether A delightful procrait, in fin

in advance of anything in which Miss
Barrymore has been seen here. Her
admirers are counseled not to miss It,
end those not already admirers to go
end become such.
To-morrow evening the Alcazar will be
gin its new stock season and. the 475 th
week of its stock history. To local drama
something of what the Tivoli is to opera,
the Alcazar continues to assume a larger
and larger importance. An excellent
reptrtcire of plays has befri characteris
tic '- of the theater throughout its Block
life, and this continuously strengthens.
The company Invariably contains if not
Mansfield's actors of parts, in some, cases
players of even the uncommon gift. And .

7 With the new leading people, and tile
f aason's repertoire of plays, the Alcazar
management is modestly hoping to make
vvtn; better history this year. ; It will not
?o ''easily with tnem. however, to supply
;he place ol John Craig, possibly the
best all-round leading man the Alcazar
has had. Charles Waldron, said to be
the youngest leading man in America,
follows Mr. Craig. Mr. Waldron has
been twenty-eight years living, and three
of them playing the leading man. He
promises . handsomely. If heredity has
anything to do with the case Mr. Wal
dron should justify the large expecta
tions that have been , aroused. He is the
son of George B. Waldron, well and im
portantly known in the actor world twen
ty-five years ago, and of Isabel Waldron,
also a one-time celebrated rJSbmbtr of
"the profession.", ;His sister, Georgia
Waldron, vis. a charming actress. Mr.
Waldron' s own career has been distinctly
honorable, his position In the New -York,
Toledo,, Columbus and Cleveland stock
companies, in he has been leading
m*n. ha^ng been , *n enviable one. â¢ .
.^ucia Moore is the new leading. Jady.
Most lately Jtfiss Moore comes from the
Belaeco Theater in Portland, where,' it is
said, Â«he, leaves a large.circle of'heart
broken worshipers.^ Miss. Moore has had
a. wide stock experience with companies
"4n New,* York, Philadelphia. Buffalo,
Cleveland, Cincinnati,' New Orleans and
Memphis, in all of which she h^s played"
l^ads. The actress is Soutnern boro and :
said* to be of exceptionally pleasing per
sonality. She will make her local debut
LOCAL ARTISTS ARE DISCOVERED
... Appreciation from a recognized com
' petent critic la to the artist the essence
"of disulled joy.
* It ie as attar of 'roses to the. nostrils,
it golden tunset to the eye, a ruby Bur
gundy to the taste, and the exhilaration
" Â«; love to the soul. â¢
And.it has comeâ af^ter long, long wait
ing â to some of our local men. It has
come to William Keith and to Xavier
Martinez in the passing months, and , Iâ
poor trhronlcVer of studio gossipâ rejoice
in the telling. And be it known 'by the
w*ay, that it was \r>. other studios than
Keith's and "Martinez' that I picked up
the joyful tidings. And it was with a
fc-pirit of camaraderie that the tale was
toyâ fÂ° r which again let us rejoice, for
good fellowship, the essence of the-.Naz
arens's.creed, is taking root among the
painters. .
Af .for Keith. I have already told of
the visit of John McKim. critic and di
1 rector of the Metropolitan Institute of
Art* to the Pine street studio, and of his
shockâ his stunâ at the things he saw.
And yet the East kÂ»ew little or nothing
of Keith. "JVhy," said he, "here is the
gxratesr landscape man in America,, and i
you of the West have kept. him all to
yourselves. But the East shall know I
himâ and know him now.V I
And he'was as good as his word, choos- ;
ing.eteven canvases, some for. his own 1
callcry and some for the Metropolitan '
Art; Institute. And thus Is. the ,K^ith j
namÂ«" gi v< ?n unto the; Eastâ Keith, "the
bi?eÂ«?tt lindscapc anan in America.',' j
Newer than the Kcitli tpisod*â whlca I

Is the fir^t olttring* of the reorganized
company.
: ix'onora Kirwin, the principal ingenue,
, wnL be an unknown quantity until next
' .week, when she .will' make her first local
appearance. Miss Kirwin comts from the
famous Keith stock companies, and has
' played Ingtnuq: leads in Philadelphia,
i J rovjuenee and Pawtucket.
The Alcazar will . retain Ernest Glen
| dinning as leading - juvenile* and could
I not do better. Mr. Glendinnlng is pos-
J sibly the most/ promising young actor
j the Alcazar has had for some time. He
j has shown personality, magnetism, dis
tinction in everything he has so far
dtne, and with larger experience should
come to a high place and at no- very dis
tapt date.
jhe return of George Osbourne will be
a signal for much rejoicing among Al
. cazar patrons. Mr. Osbourne's genial
talent lias made him a great favorite on
O'Farrell street, and most jj deservedly.
As the stern par|ent, the benevolent
uncle, the family friend, Mr. Osbourne
is invaluable. Miss Marie Howe iÂ« an
other " favorite who. will reappear this
season. - \j>: '
And there will be retained almost all
gf. the well-known "folk who have helped
to make the Alcazar what it is.
Winsome Juliet Crosby remains; Adele
Belgarde, in parts like Lady Bracknell
(in "The Importance of Being Earnest"),
hardly to be bettered; Nera Rosa, whose
Japanese maid' ("Heart 'of a Geisha")
atid whose Indian ("The Great Interroga
j tion") were classic bits of character work;
Ruth Allen, the new ingenue who seems
rapidly to bi making for a^ May Robson
career; John B. Maher, an indispensable
member .of the cast in character work;
Henry D. Byers, ateo valuable here, and
many others. So much for the company.
The list of plays tp be given is a re
markable one and includes many not be
fore 'presented here. "One at least will
have its American premiere at the Al
cazar, "The Alma Mater," a play of Ger
man student life something after the
fashion of "Old Heidelberg."
Among the* list of those that will have
tkelr first local production at the Al
cazar twill be "The t Secret of Polichi
nelle." a play from 'the French that . de
lighted JÂ»aris and as much New York
last season; Annie Russell's "The
Younger Mrs. Parting;" "Taps," a re
markable ijlay of German military life
that was one of the recent sensatfons in
Berlin; "The Bird in the Cage;" "Eben
Holden"; "Mile. Mars," Mrs. Lang
try'.Â» play; "The Prince and the Pau
per," by Mark Twaln^ "The Two Little
Vagrants;" and Frills;" "A
Clean Slate";*; ."The Unforeseen;" .by
Captain Robert Marshall; "The Princess
and the Butterfly;" "April Weather;"
"The Sword and the King;" "Squire"
Kate;" "The Dictator," Willie Collier's
play; "Qulncey Adams Sawyer;" "What
Happened to Susan;" "Among Those
Present;-" Mrs. Le Moyne's play, and
"Mrs. Deerlng's Divorce."
There will also be many . important re
vivals. "Old Heidelberg" will be done
again: they will have a first try at
''"Iris," "A * Modern Magdalen," "More
Than Queen," "The Crisis,". "Joseph,
Entangled," "The Little Minister,"
"Ranson's "Folly," and others.
â¢Altogether the repertoire as will be
seen is unusually attractive, and the
prospects for the coming season are gen
erally of the Hopefulest.
;t \u25a0.;"'\u25a0 â¢ â¢ â¢\u25a0 â¢
â¢ It-tÂ« xood to know that 'virtue is not
always its only reward. A clear : profit
of $2200 In two weeKs from the production
of *;Tii e Sea Woir* is the gratifying
Tecdrd of Mr. Bishop's books up at the
Majestic. .Mr. Bishop is rapidly earning
fame as a producer of new plays, in par
ticular Â»of the local play. Considerable
\u25a0admiration should, be going Mr. (Bishop's
way for his generous faith in the local
genius. To him lis owing the g bearing
within the last few months only of five
or six local dramatists, and the produc
tion of at least one successful new play,
"Mizpaii" (by LÂ»uscombe Searelle and
I.lla Wheeler Wilcox), soon to be pre
sented in New York by Charles Frohman.
Nor is Mr. Bishop's discovery of Joseph
Noel, dramatist of "The Sea Wolf," of
less importance, unsatisfactory as is that
mighty melodrama. Mr. Noel's next play
will be awaited witn keen interest, and
those who like their drama that way
testify to a present considerable enjoy
ment In "The Sea Wolf."
But this is very much for the manager
of the Majestic to have done; and his at
titude should be prolific of result In the
local play market. To obtain a hearing
is the crux of the dramatist's problem.
Plays of the best he may have, yet may
go Â»for years unheard of. "Leah Klesch
na" kicked around the managerial offices
.of New York for a matter of two years
before Mrs. Flske discovered its possibili
ties, this despite the fact that McClellan
â¢was well known as the author of the
libretto, of "The Belle of New York."
Clyde Fitch's "The Climbers" is said to
have been refused by every manager In
"Gotham before Miss Bingham got hold
of it. And so go innumerable stories of
plays, now numbered among international
successes. Apparently it is to be an
other story here with Mr. Bishop's gen
erous enterprise to be reckoned upon.
It is only to be hoped that he will be
able to find material worthy of his faith.-
j can "hardly rank- as "news'" as the craft
I knows itâ is the. discovery of Xavier Mar-
I tlnez by critical Xcw, Yorkersâ John Mac-.
I beth, a discriminating dealer, and an
â¢ equally discriminating artist, Arthur B.
Davis.
i Some little time ago Dealer ; Macbeth
i visited the old *Ta vernier studio, where
{Martinez paints, and like John McKim.
, was stunnfd by the work he sawâ subtle
( work, with suggestion and spirituality.
And * as for 'technique, Martinez knows
. that so well that he submerges it in the
soul of the thing, and one' fprgets the
craft of iC
And it was this quality of mentality,
suggestion ";and spirituality / that wrung
from Mr. Davis the warmest admiration
for the young* Aztec, and his viewpoint.
; "You must show your stuff', in .New
York â you must, you * must!";"* said* the
Gotham painter, "and you need not leave
California to do it. 'Leave it to me and
my fellows to present it to the : people
and Mr. Macbeth' will do the rest.:'
Already, had Mr. Macbeth made an'of
fer to Martinez ; to display his ; work In
New \u25a0 York under the very , best auspices,
and that,, too,* without the artist's leaving

The Maid
and
The Chaperon
. â¢ The more chaperons, the lower the
1 1 morality,
â¢ That is a. truth, and if. you doubt it
look at the countries where the chaperon
is a national institution, such as France,
Italy. Spain, and nearer home, in Mexico..
. " ; By I refer to the eternal
s presence of an elder womanâ the sus
picious old party who is ever on the
slert to "shoo" off a wooerâ and at" the
same time to hook him if he be rich or
powerful or otherwise D world-wprthy.
Â« : This distrust of men In these countries
has the' effect of materially* weakening
their honorâ so used have they become
to the "barricade of the duenna. It lowers â¢
.ideals. concerning womanhood, because it
suggests indelicately â¢ tbe\ eternal and.
abysmal sex auestion.
And as to its effect upon the \u25a0 girls of
those countries, it bretda deception and
abnormal sentimentality, and it dwarfs
development. â
To "be cure, these conditions apply prin- {
cipaÃy to the countries mentioned, where j
the c tnan asd the maid cannot be left
alone togetner on pain of ostracism for
"-the maidâ always the "maid. And it is in
these countries that good fellowship
' 'twixt men and. maids is imperfectly'un
derstood, the element of sex being held
to be destructive to the permanence of j
\u25a0 friendship. And thue must the duenna be i
, right it handâ else thÂ« Kiss of scandal
â¢ snake be beard. * . â
B<|t in America the chaperon doesn't
mean quite these things. Here she is
more â¢rnamentalMn fact, she is ' oft
times quite charming. But is she neces
sary after a girl has reached the age
of womanhood, 'she whose character has
\u25a0been properly bullded from Infancy?
That was long a topic of discussion Â£.t
the university .at Berkeley. Stanford
solved the problem a year or two ago by
appointing a chaperon, whose duties
wou^d be *to advise with the* girls and
escort them about.
After much talk, Berkeley now has
'made a similar appointment.
Berkeley has never gone In much for
the chaperon" system, accepting it as a
social form rather than a moral necessity.
â¢ To be sure, there are times and occa
sion! when the conventions of i sqplety
require certain observances, but the
American* girlâ and the Western â¢ girl in
particularâ is amply able to stay moral
and worthy without being, watched* by a
chaperon. And it is an axiom that the
.girl that is not able to guide herself will
not long remain moral and .\u25a0worthy, be
cause the stewardship of her character
cat.net be guarded eternally. â¢
However*, a mild chaperonageâ the
Western varietyâ is a harmless institu
tion, and nothing more than a mere con
cession to social customs, which are
more or less stupid and meaningless.

armory, the following named . were
unanimously elected officers of the com
pany for the ensuing two years: Lieu
tenant E. F. Peckham,' captain; Regi
mental Color Sergeant Harry G. "Mo-
Kannay, first lieutenant, and Private A-
Perry Harris, second lieutenant. Cap
tain Peckham, -who Is a very efflcient
and popular officer, is a veteran of the
Spanish-American war,- having, served
in the Philippine Islands' in what was
known as the Third- Artillery, U. S. -A.
In view of his enthusiasm in the vari-.
ous positions he has tilled in. the com
pany with honor to it and credit to
â¢himself "the boys", decided to. advance
him to commanding officer, w Lieuten-'
ant McKannay is ; a graduate of the
University of California and at present

Major D. A. Smith of the Fifth presided
last week at .an ejection for captain- in
Company D, at San Rafael, but before
the election he inspected the company "in
the armory and reports that the men pre
sented a remarkably! fine appearance and
have a very soldierly bearing. An exam
ination^of the i -reports disclosed^ the fact
that~.ttioBe\ whose Silty' it .Is 'to '.attend to
this matter'are very precise in the paper
work" of ; the organization. '.-; The election
resulted in o the re-election I "of Captain

nected with the guard since 1596. He en
listed for the- Spanish-American war, re
maining with his , regiment until it ;â¢ was
mustered out of service. He re-enlisted in
Company D of the Fifth and : in 1903. was
elected its captain. .In that position he
infused . a great deal . of spirit " into , the
organization and has brought it up to a
remarkable state of. efficiency. ' -\
Last week there was a, reunion of the
members of Company I of liivermore,

the old-time -.': members were Captains

after which there \ was : a banquet - and
manj^ eloquent addresses were delivered
by members of the company.

THE BIJITH.. RATE: :
;"f-^ RESIDENT ROOSEVELT- invested the subject ol natural
increase ; of , population with much interest by his remarks on
';;+â¢.; race suicide. One effect has been to cause more strict atten
tion to, vital statistics and a closer 'study of 'the! records which pre
.;. serve them. \u25a0 In vital statistics we 'read the prophecy of the rise
â¢jof. decay of nations and races. -
?"\u25a0â¢â¢"\u25a0â¢.' AVhtin Japan began, her series; of victories over Russia .the \u25a0
\u25a0\u25a0..yiariiMSts of this country and Europe warned the world of the
\u25a0'â¢yellow peril.*" because of the extraordinary fecundity of the Jap
.antse. Xot at al! with reference to .this but- simply in the prosecu^
lion of medical" and < sociological'studies-, the learned Japanese, Dr.
fVjEakkaoJ has prepared and published a valuable' paper on the birth
'rate and other vital statistics of eight nations, including his own,
\u25a0and excluding the United States. The, reason -for this exclusion is
Tour very defective system for preserving vital statistics. : Dr. Takano
Sives the births per iooo of population annually, as follows : Nor
way, 13.9; Germany, 13.2; Holland;. 12.3; European Russia, 11.9;
Switzerland, 11.9; England, 1 1.5; Denmark,. 10.9 ; Japan, 10.2 ; Bel
\u25a0gium, Hungary, 9.5; Austria, 8$; France, 1.3. The rate in the
United States is supposed to be about ii. The "figure for France is
startling. When the births iri a country are only one and a fraction
for each 1000 people, the population is practically .at-a standstill, for
â¢such a slight increase is immediately overmen by infant mor
tality. ;/â¢; \.V : i : " : â¢\u25a0\u25a0'â¢â¢Â». ' *
The alarming fecundity of Japan r which was part of. the yellow
peril, does not seem to exist. It disappears some more in Dr. Ta
kano s further statistics. The births per each 1000 marriages are in
France 22.1 and in Japan 29.8, the two countries being at'the bottom
of the list. Belgium is at the top; with 47.1 .births to each- 1000
marriages; European Russia has 40.4; Hungary,. "36.l ; Germany, 37.1,
arid England. 30. Japan, therefore^ is' behind' all European nations
except France, and the vast swarm of . Japanese . that was to over- :
run the world has not yet swarmed. In fact the statistics are omin
: pus, and Dr. Takano admits that the position of his -country .is far
lirpm satisfactory. In another respect Japan and" France are in
company at the bottom of the list. /In France the excess of births
over deaths is only 0.06; in Japan, only 8.9; in England, 11.7; Aus- ;
trra. 10.6; Germany, 13.9; Hungary, 107 ; European Russia, 14.6, and i
: ;i}cJgium, 9.8. \u25a0 â¢
\u25a0;^-;:: v:On ithe face of these statistics European Russia is the most
\u25a0 y.igorous nation in Europe, for it will be seen that a high death
rate offsets the lead of Belgium in the number of births per 1000
â¢marriages. France fares badly in; both .births and mortality, and
her statesmen may well be alarmed : when the 'births exceed the
deaths by only six-hundredths. The. .odd dislocation of things is
shown in the fact that Japan has the. largest number of marriages
per 1000 population and France -has the. least; yet in results, they
are in; company; France has 7.50 'marriages per iood population;
Japan, 8.78; England, 7.80; Austria, 8; Germany, 8.20; Hungary,
870: European Russia, 8.60. It will be' seen, then, that in the num
ber of marriages per 1000 population Erigland. is nearly as low as
France, but in results, the number ;of births, she is ahead of Japan,
which has the most marriages of alh it is 'regrettable that the vital,
statistics of the United States are not in condition to be .used in
the comparison, for then some estimate.', could be made about the
future of the two branches of the .Anglo-Saxon race.
DrVTanako's statistics make necessary the revision of several
calculations as to the future mastery of the world. A Â»great many
writers have seen in the Russian Slay the coming race. It was to
overrun Europe and Asia and dictate terms in m^'ny capitals. These
forecasts were based upon its fecundity, . its rapid increase as a
homogeneous people, moved by the same national ideals and aspir
ations. Its advance over the khanates. and Mongolia and its warlike
occupation of Manchuria seemed to justify this opinion of its ir
resistible power. Now its progress : se'ems to have been due not so
much to its efficiency as to the lack of efficient resistance. It is a
further marvel that efficient resistance" was put, up by a nation that
shares low fecundity with France. It is evident that in the "case of
Japan and Russia causes must be sought in the vigor and efficiency
of the individual and not in the number of individuals. Japan, with
29.8 births per 1000 marriages, has overcome Russia with 40.4/ The
less percentage must have acquired, by means of training, by differ
ence in ideals, by superiority of. mental and physical quality, a
â¢higher efficiency. The fact arid .its" -cause, are of interest to the
.../It may be said, by the superficial,' that the comparison of Japan
'and Russia relieves the situation of* France. "But this is not. so.
.When a nation so nearlyvbalaiices its deaths and births no individual
...efficiency can save it. ' The s'tpek is running out. The blood is
/ebbing, and if : France receive nothing from immigration the time
;<:ari foe set -mathematically when she will lie dead among- all the
/glories of her history. â¢ But the causiej the cause! What is it? Is
it over-civilization, the effect of far wars, or is it the subtle Working
''of. a purpose of nature, which brings races and species inlo being and
destroys 'thern .at will?

In the current controversy over the differential ..between' 1 corn -and
corn meal, between the millers of California and tKe millers of Mis
souri River pointsVwe have an example of. this conflict of interests.
'; The point raised by Senatpr Morgan illuminates the difficulties
that .surround the problem of rates, and raises the danger that it
may become a partisan .issue,, whereas it. was hoped that a settle
ment'would be reached without partisanship intruding into it at all.
'With all due respect for State rights, : it has been supposed that
the point was covered by the constitution, which empowers Con
gress to regulate commerce with foreign nations, between the dif
ferent States, and with the Indian tribes. .Under,:. the" Democratic
theory of \u25a0delegation of x power to the Federal Government and its
reservation to the States, Jt would seem that the States divested
themselves of - the power -'."which Senator Morgan claims for them.

his head and heart puzzling duties. ;Th6 report of their sample day's

-In 1 connection with old! Admiral Jaure
gulberry, a writer remembers a curious
Incident. At the fight of St. Jean-sur-
Erve, during the retreat on Laval, the
admiral was galloping .' along the- front,
his tall, bony figure erect, his long, . gray
side whiskers ; streaming in the wind,
when 'some u fragments.' of an exploding
shell , absolutely decapitated his . horse,
which: nevertheless; galloped on quite
forty; yards before he fell, the admiral
meanwhile retaining his seat unmoved,
though he profited by, the respite to freÂ«
himself from the stirrups in 'such a way
that as his .horse collapsed '''he'; easily,
alighted. .His "only comment in response,
to the . congratulations he received' on his
escape was very characteristic. ;'VSoine

mamma has heard the sound ,pf his ad

with kisses, entreated him to tell her
"where he's * hurt,"' and raised a \u25a0 howl
from him, which almost lifts the roof.
And then, to stop the awful noise which
she and she alone has caused, she stuffs
him full of 'goodies till his mouth is ef

TOGO'S WIFE "BOSS" '
OF THE HOUSEHOLD
MRS.'TETSUKO TOGO, wife of the
-admiral who smashed Russia's
powerful armadas at Port Arthur
and in tfys Korean Straits, is
commander in chief of their household at
Tokio, commander in chief and "keeper
of the purse, ruler of the four children
and "boss."
If Admiral Togo decides to celebrate his
great victory over the Russian^ Baltic
fleet he will be forced to appeal Â£o Mrs.'
Togo ' for funds unless he has saved
enough out of his annual allowance of
$2500 a year to furnish the -banquet for
himself and hla friends.. .
Mrs. Togo has full charge of the ex
chequer. She receives her husband's
pay, which now amounts, to about 12500
a year, with an occasional gift as a re
ward of bravery and merit, so--that>his
total income as hero and the central
flgur i of the world is less than $3000, and
every cent of this income is turned over
to his wife, who supplies him with spend
ing money. Out of this income she makes
him an allowance approximating $500 a
year, and on ;the remainder she â¢'-must
educate her four children, maintain her
quaint little home.'pay servants and dress
herself, and children In a manner worthy,
the T,-ife and children of the national
hero. i \u0084
The fact that Togo's pay ,is turned
over to his wife has revealed to the
world the fact that in the best house
holds of Japan the wife is the treasurer
and comptrollerâ the business manager of*
tha household.
;The ; Japanese uousehold is conducted
on an ideal co-operative plan, and Sa
toriKato, one of the best known Japan
ese who writes "English, has told \u25a0*\u25a0 the
story of . the domestic arrangements
among the social leaders of Tokio, re
vealing a* glimpse into the home lives of
the samurai. ~
"The Japanese household of the better
class," he , writes, "is conducted on the
co-operative plan. From the day of their
wedding the wife is the treasurer and
has absolute charge of the disbursement
of funds. The . husband turns over the
entire Income \u25a0to his wife, \u25a0 who manages
it with a skill and with ,~ results that >
would astound, the average woman. of*
Europe or America.
"Admiral Togo, as I happen to know,
turns over his entire income, which Is
less than $3000, to his wife, who has
shown herself as able in the manage
ment of the household finances and the
control of the children as her now
famous husband has been in warfare.
"She makes him a regular allowance
of pocket money-â a. sum which would

WOne of the best ways in which to en
Â«l^r entlrtislas.ticaJly into the spirit of a
novel is Just to "let yourself go*" heart
ily into the liking of the heroine of
the story and be. thankful to the clever
author for cheating her; and so giving
you the opportunity for that fictitious
'liking â something; the same â¢as you
ttl^bt to Providence for creating, the
friends you love permanently best-
Having once let that enthusiasm be
| get itself within you, thereafter if your
! heroine develops faults you can par
don her, ever hopeful of her future,
even as in much greater measure we
are aware it must be divinely done by
those "who watch like God the rolling
hours, with larger, other eyes than
oiir.J â to make allowance for us all."
Now to apply this principle to Mrs.
Thurston's Clodagh it Is very neces
sary to know her in her innocent, high
minded girlhood. If you were, unaware
' of- her antecedents, to first meet her
.when she is a full blown, beautiful
woman, with a husband far too old for
her, receiving willingly attentions from
men of very questionable character, so
fascinated with the tables of fortune
tha.t' she was reckless enough to take
uhwonianly risks, you would probably
look upon her with that interest in
which there Is no liking â perhaps turn
.away scornfully, willing to leave her
to .the rakes and gamblers, for whom
she" seemed to be fast ripening a superb
sufficiency of quality, but predestined
to'-nothing more. Thus was she gam
â¢bling in Venice when Sir Walter Gore,
the Galahad of the story, first saw her;
[â¢but he must by some intuitive clairvoy
j ance have seen the glorious, honest glrl
j hood that had grown up In hatred of
gaming" and all things dishonorable;
for he begged to be her escort home one
1 night and on the way warned Clodagh
! that she was fitted for better things
| than were the gaming companions she
had fallen among. She disdained '-. his
advice for a long time, but his person-
I allty was so much stronger than that
l.of any man she had ever met the Im
i pression of his disapproval of her con^
duct stayed "upon hex mind hauntlngly
'.till the principles his manhood stood
for dominated her even .to the over
! mastery of the hereditary love for
Rambling that her father and.; her
father's fathers had bequeathed her. \>A]
Living upon her father's estate In
Ireland is where, we first meet, Clodagh,
a glrlof is, and learn to like her. She
is a splendid, horsewoman and loves her
charming little sister, Nance, and her
cousin, Larry, and her father, who is
an Irish gentleman enslaved by the
gambling habit, which finally ruins him
and leave his two girls penniless.. She
sees clearly the awful effect the pas
,slon for, gaming is having on her parent
and uses all her: power :to break the
habit. She violently hates the sight
and thought of cards and little imagines
that later the hereditary taint will
make her gamble as, recklessly, as 'did
the men of her family. "Here Hs. a
glimpce of her at the time of " her
father's death. Her father's friend, Mr.
Milbanke. was trying^to comfort her:
" Tou must be brave,' 'he said kind

father's best friend . Clodagh was \ left -to
his care. He paid off the : debts of the
estate, and she, out of gratitude for his
kindness, married him. .; rt .was a "great
mistake for them both, for Milbanke was
fifty-five years of age, and Clodaph^was
a mere girl. The next scene^of- the story
Is in Italy. "In the four years that had
passed since Clodagh left \ Ireland , she
bad, from being a child, become a woman,
and below, the new beauty that nature
had painted upon her : face lay an in
tangible, a poignantly suggested regret
for the girlhood that had been denied
her." â¢â¢â¢ "At two-and-twenty Clodagh
was weary of her husband, of herself and
of her life." Here's a Glimpse of her
husband: "With his supersensitlveness
and constitutional sslf-dlstrust he had
withdrawn somewhat hastily from, the
position" of lover to shelter behind the
cloak of his former guardianship. And
Clodagh had hailed the change of attitude
with obvious relief.". The book is almost
as much a study of tne mistake of |an

THIS NEW NOVEL
MS NON-SARTORIAL
"Sartor Resartus," the renowned satire
by Thomas 'Carlyle on the-, subject :of
society as * made by clothes-^somethlng,
as the tailors advertise j In"-, big black"
letters, as gospel truth, that -. "clothes
make the man," now has a converse |In
the new: non-sartorial novel ;by ; the Eng
lishman, F. Dlckberry. and called - "The
Storm of London," which Is a study of
society as reformed by , being - deprived .
of - its garments ' and compelled \u25a0 to go
about and mingle socially in what was
Adamic fashion before the fall. ; Carljie's
work was the philosophy of clothes, and
Dickberry's is the" philosophy -of no
clothes. The book is said to have at
tracted attention in London, on whose
inhabitants the mysterious storm tried
the experiment of sweeping away in
one night every vestment they possessed
and , all material out of which drapery,
could be made.
Carlyle's volume is seve*re', more of a
tragedy of clothes; Dickberry's is some
what of a comedy of no-clothes; he takes
a cheery view of the , social change. It
is a serious comedy, - though, in a way;
the author does not get freshly facetious
nearly so much, nor so often, as the very
peculiar subject would surely give \ him |
ample opportunities and?' provocations -.to
be" playful about,; and tempt to such
cess. He doesn't risk at.all;iand"even
when he' writes some "line at -one of the
ends of which at least you think per
haps' he meant you might ; be \ allowed to :
laugh he does it with such a i
pen- that you can read- right on seriously,
straight-faced if you like, and keep your
attention fixed on the grave sociological
problems he is discussing from the view
point of a polite, cultured and: moral so
ciety seeing itself suddenly stripped, of all
dothes and forced to face - the situation
philosophically and make the \ best of .It.
Indeed, Dickberrjr considers that such a
seeming calamity- would 'be a blessing in
i disguise, to undlsgulse and . make : th 6
best *of us. As he works* ou the problem
a storm like that ; would 'be a consume
mation ,tb} be wishedâ at ; once a leveling
of all classes \ to full' democratic friendly
fellowship, ; and | a : lifting ; up' of the whole
people to more ."â¢ honesty,.? more ; purity,

somewhat paradoxically; calls "Edenlc at

The machinery of the'flction by which
the, sudden change is arranged for? our
Imagination , is ' that - Lord Lionel Somer
ville. disgusted and in despair! about social
conditions in London, one night during a
big storm puts a revolver to his head and
pulls the; trigger. He wakes up -In - the
morning with a faint remembrance of. his
attempt at suicide, anu finds that all his
clothing has : disappeared. He stays shut
t up in his room* for many days, but learns
from his valet that all the world is in
the same clothless ] fix. Then a strange
thing happens: The people. who have to
.work soon ; get over, the embarrassment
of : the deprivation, and go unconcernedly
about theirr various : businesses; but the
aristocrats, \ both men and ; women,, not
being compelled to attend-to any duties,
remain locked. up in their rooms till the
situation becomes jj more - absurd to stay
in than to go outl So out at last they
go, and gradually get used to *, .it. Lord
Somerville : finds the V change la working
such a revolution for j the betterment of
humanity that _} he recovers from his
despair and becomes a ' hopeful : reformer ;
and - advocate of the advantages of no
clothes.; The people of high rank were
the worst worried. The absence of dress
made it so difficult to mark social distinc
tion. "The artist, Vane, proposed a solu
tion of -this 'difficulty: : ....-\u25a0. '':
, "My dear Lady Carey." resumed Vane,
"it is noj; a question of decency at pres
ent, but a matter of artistic feeling." I
should propose- organizing the;- thing; in
this way: Dukes would have. a red color
thrown over their lordly forms; earls and
barons -a blue shade;* baronets yellow;
commoners would have no color, but the
members of the royal family would have
red and yellow stripes. Ladies would
naturally. have their shades, too, accord
ing; to their rank: Duchesses, pink; count
esses, pale green, and so one. This is a
rough; sketch."
:>One of 'the consequences of the enforced
nudity is that the' aristocrats gain much
of. the wisdom that had hitherto been the
monopoly of the toilers of the world.
This pleases Lord Somerville immensely,
and he gets long talks from the house
maids, and the below-stalrs people gen
erally, which is very enlightening to him
as to what these folks used, to think of
their masters and mistresses. There is
muclu thought given to artistic Improve
ments-beauty, of ; human form and in
crease of grace because of the unadorn
ment.by clothing making it more culti
vated., , ' . \u25a0 . .
Perhaps" the best result of this new book
will be to remind people again of that
great work of Carlyle, "Sartor Resartus,"
and send them back to re-read It. In that
volume there is a chapter, on "Adamlt
ism." which Is about "The universal
utility of clothes, and their higher mystic
virtue^ illustrated. Conception of man
kind stripped naked ; and Immediate con
sequent dissolution of .'civilized society."
In it Carlyle says of Professor Teufels
drockh: "The utility of clothes is alto
gether apparenfto him: nay, perhaps he
has an insight, and almost mystic quali
ties," what we might | call the omnipotent
virtue of clothes, such as* was. never be
fore vouchsafed to' any man." Which'
sentence, of course, speaks the truth of
the author of "Sartor Resartus.'" /Another
of.Carryie's chapters. end 3 thus (It might
have made a good motto : for Dickberry's
new novel):
'..-' "Nevertheless "there, is something "great
In the ! moment i when a man first strips
hjmserf of \u25a0adventitious" wrappages: and
sees Indeed that he is naked, and. as
Swift has It, .'a forked, straddling animal
with: bandy legs';" yet also. a Spirit." and
unutterable Mystery of Mysteries/' . ....

THE LOVE AFFAIRS
KOF FOUR PEOPLE
"Comedy of Circumstances" would have
been : a good other name for George \u25a0 Barr
McCutcheon's â new story,' : if he" had .; not
chosen to call' it . "Nedra."^ 'The \u25a0 author
of "the "successful "Beverly, of Graustark"
writes i of ' a 'queer [ mlx-up of the love ; af-.
fairs of - : four .' people In "- his .- latestAven^

arid i the : consequent ; lies ' eloping/ enf

enough to hold It ; down to' anything that
can i be "called \u25a0; a , study, /and .this ', story ; of
an T elopement is just a comedy : .of circum
stances.^^^
-T It *is ywritten with .'considerable .l fertility
of '- imagination and much fluency'of lan
guage ; but ' it ': is. only I intended ? to'/ lightly
entertain. .'You can^depend ; on being gen

haustingly, played .upon. Probably. George
Barr^ McCutcheon^F/deliberately \, \ intended
that ' it^shall *â¢ be ; so/, and i his creations ' are
not v asking Uojbe/. taken 'seriously.'.
. Nedra is the "> name lof'l an 'island, \u25a0\u25a0but

coyer it-t* Hugh' Ridgewayn the" hero of, the
story,*! is i the j first iwhite \u25a0 man { to ) set *â¢ foot
onit; and he Is landed, there by a typhoon
that wrecked the Tempest Queen, upon
which vessel he was eloping: with Grace
Vernon, "a beautiful and .loving 1 million
airess. Through theY black .waves from
sinking ship to unknown shore he bore in
bis arms a. fainting womanâ thinking he
was resetting Grace Vernon. Daylight re
vealed that the saved woman was the
beautiful Lady Tennis, who, had. up to
the,; time' of', the typhoon's fatal work,
been wife to Lord Huntlngford. who most
fortunately was drowned,, for he was too
old for the lady and she was glad to be
free. The old lord was mean and a ras
cal. \u0084 too. and this made her excuse for
being glad quite complete.
Isolated on the j island of Nedra this
male and this female Crusoe- have won
derful adventures with 1 a race of sav
ages who : worship the beautiful white
strangers as gods.'. They Induce the
natives to drown.t heir b'ig-,' fierce-look
ing stone idol; and as the dethroned
god sinks Into the* rapids of the river
they listen unregretfully- to "his un
happy kerplunk;"
Very soon our hero's love for Grace'
Vernon, with whom he had been so
eagerly eloping, sinks kerplunk also?
for Lady "Tennis, who by the by, was
named after Lord Tennyson, Is too at
tractive to be left long alone with on
a desert island and not set love aflame
In the breast of Grace's man. whom
the comedy of circumstances has thus
placed under the spell of her beautiful
blue eyes and her distractingly black
hair. Besides all that, Hugh thought
that Grace was drowned â although he
wasn't so glad about it as that Lady
Tennis' lord was dead. There is some
thing in this situation that will remind
the reader of Mallock's racy ' story
called "Positivism on an Island'; but
this of JlcCutcheon's Is not designed to
be either so wicked or so laughable a3
Mallock's inimitable flaying with the
almost impossibility of piety under
certain imaginable comedies of circum
stance. Hugh and Lady Tennis are ex
emplarlly moral so far as external con
duct goes: but as for true blue con
stancy of inward soul-passion it was
very soon as absent from their breasts
as they were from civilization on their
far-off Crusoe Island. Grace Vernon
was as good as forgotten by the island
ers as soon as the famous "accident,
blind contact, and the strong necessity
of loving" got in ita work. Luckily the
elopement had not gone the length 61
'marriage, else would, the easy assump
tion that Grace had been drowned have
become more like tragedy than comedy.
The richness of the: comedy of cir
cumstances is not fully shown till the
wrecked couple get back safely to civ-
ilization. There they find out that Grace
was rescued and still lives. Lord Hunt
ingford was conveniently dead, how
ever. "- His widow magnanimously de
cides to renounce Hugh and let him
marry his elopement lady. Grace mean
while has fallen In. love with another
man. The strain on the love nerves of
the four people Involved is^awful until
the secret of their luckily complement-,
ing estrangements Is revealed: and then
all f out** are ecstatically â¢ happy. Veath,
Grace's new lover, is the best of the
quartet, but even he was' not so admir
able., We can rejoice greatly, at his
happiness, for he was eagerly grasping
at the second-class Joy of getting the
girl who -had so easily been comforted
for the loss of Hugh. It is Just such,
a comedy of circumstances as' Is hap
pening, everywhere and all the time to
inconstant souls^ and down upon
which, no doubt, the ' angels look and
laugh at the brevity of earthly love
and the often inability of the sweet
illusion to outlast a physical absence
that is a little long. \u25a0 '

BOERS FIGHTING
YELLOW PERIL
Revolting Murder by ;Coolie
Miners Arouses Popular
Feeling in tile Transvaal
HET JOUBERT
Boy of Ten Brings -Succor
s to Family After HisFather^
Had Been ; Foully-/ Slaiii
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PRETORIA, Sept. 30.â Popular - feeling
against the continuation of â¢ the system
under ' which the - Rand gold mines are
worked/ by .Chinese .'coolies has' been
greatly' strengthened by a /revolting)mur
der which occurred recently in the Mid-,
dleburg- district.) g The victim' was Piet
Joubert, a typical Boer farmer who, . after
fighting jto I the; last for the independence
of the j Transvaal, ; had accepted ; British
domination and set himself " sturdily, to
work to repair the ravages of war. which
had left him . practically, penniless.- With
his. family,; consisting, of his wife,' two
daughters, aged 15 and 13, a. boy . of ;10
and. a baby, only 11 ] months, old, he lived
in. a.- small: brick -.house? not' far from the
mines, at .Moab's Velden.
Desertions among the Chinese. employed
on these mines have been numerous. The
deserters. . wander about' the country! llv-
Ing by theft . and , plunder.- One night a
party jof, these; marauders : Jou
bert's house and two of them gained en
trance to the single living room by - forc
ing, open a window. The, noise theyimade
awakened Joubert: Unarmed. and attired
in .his nightclothes he rushed into the
room. '" Xp. : sor>iit;r had he . crossed tho'
threshold than ,the two Chinese *set upon
him. \ One lof them had . a knife and the
other a plckhandle. [ Joubert backed; into
a corner and defended himself vigorously
with' his 'fists. -...Tw0 more coolies stole in
through the .-.window and . joined in the
fight against -him. \u0084; . '
Getting hold of a chair he contrived for
a time to keep his assailants at bay, be
ing, favored by the darkness. Bu the soon
lost this advantage. . One of 'the Chinese
chanced to have a box jof matches, and
dropping rhis, weaponâ a. shovelâ devoted
himself to striking lights that his \ three
companions might. s^e how to make their
blows effective. â¢ \u25a0 After , that the odds
proved too much for.' the; stout old Boer.
While he was -trying to bring a." chair
down on the . head of one of | the Celes
tials another jabbed "a knife between his
ribs, and he was soon bleeding from half
a* dozen wounds.
Before he. went down, however, his son
ran into the room. A mere child though
he was he had the spirit of his race. He
had armed himself with a stout stick and
placed himself by his father's side; pre
pared to battle with all his puny, strength.
Amazed at the. pluck shown', by .'the- .-little
fellow the Chinese drew back. .-..' '
"You can only -save -us all- from, being
murdered," said his father,' "by. bringing
help: -Ill-try to clear: the rway. for you
and. then you must run for.it." \u25a0'â¢ ;
*TU <lo it. dad." said the boyl
Summoning all his strength ; for ,a last
desperate, ' effort | Joubert flung ..himself
at', the" Chinese.. Iri ih^/melee the boy
slipped 'by them and scrambled' through
the window. Before^ he succeeded In
clearing, it, however,; one "of the. Chinese
made a vicious" thrust'at.' him" with a
knife and . slashed j him j across the | head.
Another. Celestial dashed after him.-! 1 !
Though wounded and bleeding profusely
the youngster kept his wlts. ! 'Instead of
taking 'at once vto his. legs, which would
have. resulted .in, his: being' speedily over
taken,' he slipped behind -some bushes
and crept away In â¢ the darkness on all
fours. When he felt- assured that he had
placed such distance between himself and
the murderous ' heathen who was seeking
for him that ,his -footsteps could not be
heard, he dashed across the veldt to the
house of the /nearest neighborsâ the ..Ven
ters. r '\: .' - ' \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 : --, \u25a0"'-\u25a0: :'\u25a0 .-' '\u25a0'\u25a0
Meanwhile;. Joubert, his , strength ex
hausted, had fallen to the floor, and as.he
went down a coolie drove a knife through
his skull. But :the * heroism of * that ' little
Boer household had not, oeen exhausted.
Holding her baby clasped: to" her breast
in .her left, hand and wielding a hunting
knife in hersrlght. Mrs. Joubert ran into'
the room. Not knowing tffat her husband
was already, dead, she j stood -over* his
prostrate body.'. Because : they had in
view a worse' fate for Â£ her than death the
coolies attempted to 'disarmV her. vV'Af ter
a brief struggle she still retained, posses
sion of the knife,' and two of the Chinese
had been badly "cut t across the hands.
While thejrwere; concerting fresh'meas
ures to deal with 1 her, '.-thef Chinese who
had gone in pursuit of the boy; returned
with the tidings that he had escaped, and
as he- was. sure to raise an alarm, 1 ; they,
would better, all: seek safety in -flight; â¢ :
They were captured some twelve j miles
distant .'from the scene of ' their crime.
Among those who' helped track" them was
John- Viljoen,- a brother of Generar Vil
joen. He was the first td discover them
and brought them to, a -halt wlth.a'Jfew.'

\u25a0 Liverpool recently, , when . Dr. Watson,
declared that; his recent action in- re-1:
signing his pastorate in ' that city/was
due' entirely to a wish to give himself
up to literary work. -
"lan Alaclaren" has occupied the pul
pit of the Sefton Park Presbyterian
Church, in Liverpool, since , 1880. .v His
decision/ resign' created; dismay
among \ his parishioners and every ef
fort has ; been made -to persuade him
to continue his ecclesiastical work, ;but
the, author, is linn, far 'he': says" he has
found it true that no man can serve
tAvo^ masters. And being a Scotchman,
withal a kindly one, it is not likely
that he will -change his mind. , .
Dr. Watson, has published/nothing
since 1901, when. his "Life of the Mas

literary; harness again, however, he: is
going to \u25a0 take a holiday and is as yet

the case. For says the authoress: .

Credit for the best talk of the ses
sion was accorded to William H. Lang

presenting Langdon'e claims for public
favor Delegate Harry Knox remarked
that Mr. Brandenstein, the fusion nom
inee, was a -"four flusher." Knox's'ut
terances were somewhat ambiguous,
and the convention was left in doubt
for. a time whether the four-flushing
accusation was intended for Byington
or Brandenstein, but those who t were
in position to distinctly hear all that
the delegate had to say on the subject
aver that Brandenstein was accused of
"four flushing." Knox was not quite
as lucid in his remarks as he: should
have been on a momentous occasion in
volving nomination to the office of 'Dis- 4

thorities. learning of the visit, dis
patched a body of "troops, which,, dis

â¢"In. its report on the labors of the

to say that their investigation has de

"We doubt." continued the report, "if

ways by which the affairs of this com

fort fully to expose these conditions
has been opposed by corruptÂ»lnterests
and the systematic resistance of power
ful Influences apparently syndicated to
conceal the truth and encourage crime.
We ha-e been hampered by the ef
forts of witnesses to conceal the facts,
and in many of these instances It has
l oen apparent that* the witness was
terufying falsely. Our observations re

is such that we must characterize it as
nothing short of. outrageous." Â»

and that it has been found that after

a systen of fee-taking grew up at

ing be. still further scrutinized and
that the county board take steps to
stop this form of grafting. Many ways
in which the Sheriff's office profits from
u.ese fees are mentioned. Bribery, the
report says.. â¢* an every-day affair.
County offices should ba investigated.
The County Clerk should not get'^ees,
but "does, and the practice should be
stopped at once.

opportune.- H. W. Ham

Although the thug shot by Officer
Lestrange was positively identified by
J. S. Thatcher, of 1143 Myrtle street,
yesterday, for some unexplained reason
Thatcher was not subpenaed at the
inquest which was held at 'the branch
morgue in Berkeley last night, and
without his testimony the Coroner's
jury was forced to incorporate in its
verdict the fact that the dead thug was
unknown. The jury found the deceased
had come to his death from the effects
of a gunshot wound Inflicted by Police
Officer John J. Lestrange in discharge
of his duty as an officer of the law and
exonerating the latter from all blame
for the death of the burglar.
The only witnesses examined at the
inquest were 'Dr. H. N. Rowell, Detec
tive Jamleson and Officer Lestrange.
Their testimony related simply to the
death of the thug and the description
of the wound which caused death. The
members of the Jury were: Dr. M. H.
Smith, S. Ruys, J. P. Penfield, C. R.
Hoeffly, J. A. D. Hutton and J. H.

Queer Behavior of Bay Boat
Near Baltimore Leads to
Discovery of Act of Piracy
Special OUsatcb to Tie Call.
BALTIMORE, Sept. 30/ â With all sail
set, 1 but with no one at the helm, the
bay boat Annie Francis, was found
dodging aimlessly about at daylight to
day among the on ;Patapsco
River. Henry Johnson, her captain,
and Henry J., Farber. her ~ mate,: were
unconscious in her cabin/ Harry; Gard
ner, the negro cook, "was murdered and
thrown overboard by James Burr ell, the
negro deck hand, who also was gone.
Burrell had taken a skiff and $300,
which. the captain had given him as the
price of his life and that of the mate. ..:
Just at daylight the tug Uncle Sam
noticed the peculiar behavior of the
boat. The sails would fill and* she
would dart up. into the wind until the
canvas slatted. Then she would fall off
again. The tug, after some difficulty,
got alongside and her crew found Far
ber on the floor of the cabin and John
son half on the floor and half on his
bunk.
Johnson and Farber have told the po
lice that they were asleep in the cabin
Friday night, with Gardner at the
wheel and Burrell on lookout. About
10 o'clock Johnson was awakened by
scuffling on deck forward.' He heard
several blows and an outcry. He start
ed up the companionway, but; was
knocked back into the cabin. Burrell
followed him and, as Farber rolled
from his bunk, felled the mate.'.
Captain Johnson attempted to rise,
but Burrell knocked him down again.
"I want your money," said Burrell as
he stood over Johnson. "If you don't
give it to me I'll finish both of you." \u25a0
Captain Johnson had 5600, but told
Burrell^he only had $300. The mutineer
cursed, but took the money, and after
telling the captain if he made an out
cry he would, complete' his work ho
went on deck and left the boat.
Johnson is in St. Joseph's Hospital
with a fractured skull. Farber is there
with a lacerated scalp and" other inju
ries.

V WINNIPEG, Man., Sept. 30.â Charles
King, the Wilderness murderer, was
hanged at Mounted ' Police barracks.
Fort Sackatchewan. this morning. Aft
er eating a hearty breakfast he went
to the scaffold coolly and unassisted.
When the executioner knocked at his
cell door to say that he 'must prepare
for the great tragedy. King,' In a pa
thetic tone said to him: "I do not know
what you are ' hanging me for. I am
an innocent man. God knows I am
an Innocent man." .^ '
When i the death procession was
formed King marched steadily up to
the 'scaffold. He assured Rev. Father
Jan, who has been his spiritual ad
viser, that he . was prepared to meet"
his God. As the priest repeated the
Lord's prayer, Radcllffe, the hangman,
released the. bolt which held the trap
door upon which the murderer stood
and the slayer of Edward Hayward in
the wilderness of Lesser Slave Lake
was sent Into eternity.
Last evening King's lawyer, who de
fended him In both trials, called at the
barracks to say farewell to the con
demned man... The latter , thanked him
for the : effort' he had put forth, and
while he could not'offer him a reward
In this world's goods, he hoped that

slowly up the avenue. The President
was deeply touched by the welcome and
especially by this spontaneity.
"It was awfully kind of them to
come out to greet me," he remarked
to some friends at- the White House
porte cochere, "and I was deeply, deep
ly touched by their welcome."
The Presidential train came into the
station at. 6:19 o'clock. On the plat
form was assembled a dozen or more
officials. At their head was Mr. West,
the District Commissioner, who was in
charge of the arrangements for the
welcome and was the first to shake
the President's hand as he stepped
from the train. With the President
were Secretary of State Root and Mrs.
Root and Secretary of the Treasury
Shaw. At /the station were Secretary
Hitchcock, Postmaster General Cortel
you, Mr. Quesada, the Cuban Minister;
Dr. Rixey, the surgeon general of the
navy; Mr. Palmer, the Marshal for the

in carriages, accompanying the Presi

dent frequently arose and bowed to the
cheering crowds' on- both sides "of the
avenue, and during.; the latter;, part
of the drive the "hurrahs", became so
enthusiastic that the' President stood

Funston Makes Kecommend

Special Dispatch to The' Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. - 30â Brigadier
General Frederick Funston", 1 commanding
the Department of California, calls at
tention in his annual report .to the need
j of modern buildings, on the Presidio;res
ervation. The present. structures,, he de
clares, are" not creditable to. the Govern
ment, being old \u25a0 and dilapidated*, and
should' be demolished.; He adds that one
of the greatest' drawbacks : to : the- useful
ness of the Presidio as an infantry, cav
alry or 'field artillery, post "has -been the
small extent of open and reasonably level
ground for drill purposes. .
A board to consider the advisability of
filling .in a tract near the bay shore and
to prepare estimates for thee ost of such
work was â¢ convened' by Major . General
'Arthur Mac Arthur when . he commanded
this department. ; and rafter exhaustive
and painstaking investigation he made a
report .which, according to information
received from the War Department, will
be submitted to Congress at the coming
session. :.'\u25a0-\u25a0-\u25a0 \u25a0['' '.-\u25a0' -.. ' " :;'?.-â¢ ; 'Â£ .- - . \u25a0 \u25a0
If favorable action is had the value of
the Presidio as a military, reservation will

NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 30.â A terrific
rainstorm, that temporarily put many
streets" under witter, descended on the city
10-day, ; ; but â¢as the. water was speedily
carried off by the drainage - machines
there jwas no interruption of the work of
either 7 doctors or inspectors in the yellow
fever infected- districts. The death list
was again a source of gratification, point
ing unmistakably to the fact that the
type of. fever is exceedingly mild.
; To-day, completed the tenth wpek of the
fight against the disease. With the fever
practically .whipped, conferences are now
proceeding ' in connection with the estab
lishment of a permanent hospital, by
which it is hoped to prevent any further
recurrence of th& fever in epidemic form.
Following the example of Havana, the
fundamental actionof the promoters is to
secure \u25a0 a site likely to be most free of

Sceiie TOiere Boccacio Laid'
His Famous "Decameron"
Is to Be Sold at Auction
FLORENCE, Italy, Sept. 30.âEvery
one who has revelled in the lively
pages of the "Decameron" of Giovanni
Boccaccio will be interested in the com
ing sale of the beautiful Villa Palmiera,
near Florence. For there It was, ac
cording to tradition, that Boccaccio laid
the seene â if it can be called soâ of the
"Decameron"; in other word 3, it was at
this ancient Florentine mansion that
the writer imagined his now world-re
nowned tales to have been told.
Most folk have read the "Decameron"
and will remember its opening. The
scene is Florence in 1348, the year of
the great plague In the city of Dante.

BURGOMASTER OF BERLIN^WHO
WRITES POETRY AND WHO IS
ALSO A DRAMATIST.
GERMAN MAYOR
WRITES POETRY
Berlin Boasts of Burgomast
er Who Is Dramatist and
Romanticist of Renown
BERLIN, Sept. 30. â As befits a city
that lays claim to being the artistic and
Intellectual hub jof Europe, Berlin
boasts of a Burgomaster or Mayor, who
is a poet, dratnatist and romanticist of
talent and renownâ Dr. George Reicke.
He Is only 42 years old, and. -therefore,
according to his admirers, only on the
threshold of a career brilliant with
promise. Although Mayor Retcke la
what the " Germans call a "real poet,"
he is a man of action and activity, too.
Unlike most poets he is completely at
humu in the world oÂ£ affairs, j He is an
able Jurist and would win lams at the
bar if he had not chosen to devote his
greatest energies to the divine muse.
He is a disciple of the strenuous life
and at the City Hall has the reputation
of being able to Idlspoae of a task In
weeks that requires months from his
colleagues. He is a thoroughly modern
man, with a talent for. administration
and bold progressive , temperament. .'-
Reicke was born at- Koenigsberg in
1*63. His father, was a well-known
student, of \u25a0; the philosopher, Kant. Dr.
Reicke .left* the gymnasium at IS .years
of age; After a career of miraculously
rapid growth; -in which he came fre
quently into conflict; with the powera
that-be on account of free thinking, he
was ; elected- Burgomaster of : Berlin, a
position which he ' adorns with" con
spicuous dignity and ability. '.The mu
nicipal Board of Aldermen, with whom
the privilege of naming tha^Burgomas
ter rests, felt Reicke's I choice to be a
particularly happy one. iri view of Ber
lin's reputation as a "Kultnrstadt" (cul
ture city), and. when; he 4 i,s ; on duty on
gala occasions, wearing the robes and
chain of his high office, he is-surround
ed by. admiring municipal councillors,
who feel personal pride in their Burgo
master's \u25a0 esthetic bearing. .. . ; â¢ â¢
As might be expected, Reicke devotes
'< much of his official activity to the phy
sical beautifying of Berlin. . Schemes
contemplating the improvement of
streets, squares, buildings and parks
usually emanate from him. He is a
stickler for the artistic effect, and
generations yet unborn will have cause
to thank the poet-burgomaster for the
countless "municipal beauties" which
Berlin will bequeath to posterior citi
zens. "
Reicke i 3 a bachelor and one of the
most courted men in Berlin society.
Kxcursion to Uktah.
On Sunday, October Bth. the Califor

reason that these excursions are always
popular is that the railroad company

that every one will have a.- seat. :Thia ia

standing, one or two cows and occa
sionally ahorse and some sheep. Some
times these animals are up to their
knees in the manure.- Irregular holes
in the thatch provide/entrance and exit
for the i fowls, which nest -in 'baskets
hung against the walls. Outside the
houses the ground Is sodden with water
and drainage, and is altogether in a
most -unsightly and insanitary, state."
In _ other , townships the conditions
were still: worse. ; In Arnol the visiting
officials .saw "the Â»v:age- earner of one
household lying, in bed- in the- living
room \u25a0\u25a0 In an advanced atage of phthisis
and expectorating on the floor. Around
him were his 'wife and children. There
were no partitions in . this dwelling and
the ..human and animal occupants all
herded together in one large room.- In
all; there .were in it nine people, three
cows standing in from four to five feet
of /manure, ">a sheep and a number of
fowls.
At Bragor it was found that "nearly
every house was .unlnhabltablo and a
disgrace.to our civilization." All over
the Island the water supply, is in a bad
state, owing ,to the utter neglect of
anything like drainage and 6Â»::eric is

JAMES C CRAWFORD
dancer at several amateur entertain
mentsâand at his request she gave him a
taste of her Terpsichorean quality. Her
high kicking especially won his admira
tion, and he challenged her to kick his
hat held as high as he could extend his
hand without removing 'his feet from the
floor. She accomplished the feat with
ease and then bantered him Into at
tempting It. While she held the hat Miss
Nash upheld the kicker by standing be
hind him and clasping his waist with her
arms. He failed miserably to equal Miss
Miller's performance, and then Miss Nash
said, "Gracious, how late it is; I'll just be
killed when I go. home; let's go, Bessie."
Despite the protests of their host they
fled the apartment, after hastily promis
ing to meet him the next evening.
"Ay ban havin' ay goad time," Mr.
Johnson plaintively concluded, "when ay
ben roabed."
"When were you robbed?"" inquired the
attorney for the defense.
"When ay was kickin'," Mr. Johnson
replied, "ay loast twentay doallar from
ay vest poaket."
"And you are still kicking," re
marked the Judge.
The defendants, who incidentally
confessed that they deceived Mr. John
son when they told him they lived with
their parents, will be afforded oppor
tunity next Tuesday to defend them
selves. When arrested and identified
neither of them possessed the $20 al
leged to have been taken from Mr.
Johnson's vest pocket as he physically
kicked, nor was the $3 which Miss Nash
had neglected to return to him found
in that young person's purse. I
Mr. Johnson's endeavor to find com
miseration In the court corridor, prior
to and after he had testified, was un
successful. Those listeners who did not
turn to him the proverbial cold shoul
der either quizzed him or pronounced
his money loss inadequate punishment
for his escorting of seemingly unso
phisticated girls to places of question
able repute.
In the court of Judge Cabanlss quite a
flutter was caused by the declaration of
a colored defendant that his name was
Willie Wilson. and that he held the re
sponsible position of buggy driver,- for
Coroner Leland. He was charged with
having battered a negro seaman named
Albert S. Carter, but the accusation was
almost lost sight of in the \u25a0 excitement
created by the question of his -identity.
Several weeks ago one Willie ; Wilson
(colored) was before Judge Mogan on the
charge of having disturbed an Afro-
American ball and resisting the police
man who arrested him, and his discharge
was only obtained after he had. been Im
prisoned several days and Dr." Leland
had personally vouched for his previous
peaceable character. It was then ; gener
ally understood in Hair of Justice and
Coroner's office circles that dismissal of
Mr. Wilson by- the doctor quickly fol
lowed his dismissal by the Judge, which
explains the agitation provoked in the
tribunal of Judge Cabaniss by the claim
of a putative Willie Wilson (colored) that
he was employed as groom by the ' Co
roner.
Some of the court attaches were eager
to wager even money that the man there
accused was not the original -Willie Wil
son, while others who, believed otherwise
held out for odds. Clerk Barney Conlan,'
who has acquired some fame as a thwart
er of false pretense, side-stepped the ris-

Special Dispatch to The Call.
' SANTA ROSA, Sept. 30.-Congressman
W. P. Hepburn of lowa, chairman of thÂ«
1 Committee on Interstate Commerce of the
;. National House of. Representatives. ..was
j a visitor to Asti and the Italian-Swiss
. Colony's winery in Northern Sonoma
; County to-day. The trip was made at the
! instigation of Congressman Duncan Mc
> Kinlay of this district* and on invitation
! of President Andrea Sbarboro of the Ital
i ian-Swiss coionyl
i The party consisted of Congressman
! and Mrs. Hepburn, Congressman, and
Mrs. D. E. McKinlay, Professor and Mrs.
Bernard JUoses of the University of Cali
fornia, Atherton Bunnell of New -York,
1 Judge and Mrs. Albert G. Burnett, Mr.
j ana Mrs. Allen G. â Â«ramon and Mrs. " E.
J Pi Woodward of Santa Kosa and Andrea
j Sbarboro.
; Several hours were enjoyed in ' going
i through the winery and in watching the
! grapes pass from, the wagons to the big ;
40,000-gallon wine vats. Much interest
was manifested by the visitors in tho pro
cesses and the vast capacity of the cel
lars.
A drive followed, during which : the
guests viewed the acres of vines and the
icrtile valley. One and -all they admired
the patience and perseverence that had
wrested tho valley from the virgin for
ests and turned it into producing fields.
L.uncheon was served- beneath an arbor
upon the gro-unds. Congressman Hepburn,
Congressman McKinlay and Mr. Bunneil
gave interesting, accounts tif their recent
trip to the Philippine Islands, in which
Piofessor Moses, who was one of the
original Philippine Commissioners, par
ticipated.
"The Filipinos are starved," declared
Congressman Hepburn. "Give them,
enough nourishing food, and the proper
training and they will -be another people.
Military men told me that under, th'e ra
tions furnished the \. enlisted men they
gained from fifteen to twenty pounds in
weight in a month's time and became
active and enduring: Even the prison
keepers noticed this and reported gains as
high as twenty pounds per month among
the prisoners, who were fed regularly on
prison uiet. They cannot be active and
energetic without sufficient nourishment.
The great trouble is, they have no
strength to earn food, and can get no too-d
without strength to earn It.
\u25a0 "The Islands present the greatest prob
lems ever undertaken by our Government.
This trip will be of inestimable value this
winter in legislation, and those who ac
companied Secretary Taft will be in a po
sition to furnish it." *
Referring to legislation along the line of
pure foods, in which the gentlemen who
'planned to-day's outing are interested,
Congressman Hepburn continued:
"Three times a pure food bill has been
passed by the House and killed in the
Senate. Until two years ago the; Na
tional Physicians' Association would not
indorse it. After it did the National.
Dairymen's Association followed, and then
all the largest interests in the country
except the liquor dealers gave it indorse
ment. â¢ The liquor men object to the pro
hibition placed upon the blending of
whiskies. This is admissible, in the case
of wines, but not in whiskies. It prohibits
the transportation of fruit or' other arti
cles from one State or section of a State
to another for packing as grown there.
Every article must bear a guarantee of
just what it contains and#where grown
or produced." \u25a0 1
The party left San Francisco by the
7:SO o'clock boat this morning and re
turned this evening about the same time.
The afternoon was ; spent in and \ around
the Pompeiian villa of Mr. Sbarboro. Mrs.
Hepburn sustained the prohibition | repu
tation of ' lowa by refusing all offers of
wine. .

All the.se sufferers feel In their hearts that

of United States Senator Money. Owing
to the prevalence of yellow fever In the
South, Governor Vardaman of Mississippi
and his staff were unable to attend the!
launching. The Governor was represented t
by Senator Money. The guests Included'
Admiral Dewey, Lieutenant Commander'
Wood, Rear Admiral Rogers, Mayor)
Weaver of this city, naval officers eta- ]
tioned here and in Washington and many i
prominent civilians. . 'â¢
The christening party consisted Of Sena- 1
tor and Mrs. Money, Miss Money and her'
fiance. Dr. William W. Kitchen. They
were escorted to the yard by General
George, B. Williams, Cramp's Washington
representative, who accompanied them to
this city. Immediately after the launch
ing luncheon was served.
The Mississippi will carry the smallest
displacement of any United States battle
ship now being built, with the excepton
of the Idaho, a gster ship. The displace
ment of these two vessels is 13,000 tons
each, while all the later battleships, in
cluding the Vermont, Kansas and Minne
sota, now being completed in other ship
yards, have a displacement of 16,000 tons.
The Mississippi will be equal to many
battleships of 16.000 tons displacement
No vessel of the same displacement in
any navy of the nations carries equally
heavy batteries. The main batteries will
consist of four 12-inch breech-loading
riefls mounted in two turrets; eight 8-inch
breech-loading rifles mounted in four tur
rets; eight 7-inch breech-loaders behind
casement armor and two 21-inch sub
merged torpedo tubes; also the secondary
batteries-^twelve 3-inch, .six 3-pounders,
two 1-pounder automatics, two 1-pounder
rapid-lire guns, two 3-inch field pieces,
two machine guns and six automatic.
The Mississippi will be 375 feet in length
on the water line and the length over all
will be SE2 feet, with a beam of 77 feet.
The speed requirement Is 17 kriots. The
ship will be equipped with triple expan
sion twin screws of 10,000 Indicated horse
power, fitted with eight Babcock & Wl
cox water tube boilers and set in water
tight compartments. Except for the wind
lass and'steerage gear, practically all the
other machinery will be run by electricity.
Wireless telegraph apparatus will be in
stalled, and, in fact, the Mississippi will
be so equipped as to equal in every way
the high standard of requirement for
modern warships.
There will be commodious quarters pro
vided for the crew of 750 officers and men,
with special attention paid to sanitary
needs.

His Ministers an Anxious
Time. '
! MADRID, Sept. 30.â The insistence of
King Alfonso in carrying out state mat
ters and ignoring the advice of expert
enced diplomats is causing much dissat
isfaction in certain quarters . here. \ His
mother.no longer has any control over
him. In short, he practically does as he
pleases.
Ministers and newspapers are demand
ing that the King, when taking his mo
tor' drives, Shall cease to risk his life,
end that he shall put on the brake. Re
cently he picked up a . tramp while out
on a jaunt in his racing Mercedes,: and |
took him along at such a pace that; the
man, who did not know him, entreated
to be" set down again. - '.
Next day he saw Alfonso in the capital
.surrounded by t brilliant military escort,
and on being told that It was the King,
remarked coolly: "Then he didn't break

situation is that many of .'the Methodist

to ? whether^ or " riot ' Dr7' BeetTshould } have

when . president ; of the ? Method" IsU Confer
ence, in a. signed â¢ article; , maintained that
Dr. Beet's views in no way, detracted
from his evangelical orthodoxy.
The significance of this, was- niade ap
parent in a recent talk I had .with Dr.
Beet in his home â¢at the'= Wesldyan Col
lege. In a comfortable though somewhat
old-fashioned study; .. overlooking .'the
flower-decked lawn of the campus, this
mild-mannered and charming elderly, gen
tleman of* the old school told me why
his conscience no longer allowed him to
keep from the world the written. reasons
for his belief that the. material hell of
John Wesley is a my th. : r> -;
"We must have'growth in theology; as
in other things," said Dr. Beet. "Why, a.
hundred years ago it was believed that
infants were punished after death! Much
of what we . now recognize as % error has
always been mixed with. truth.
"We cannot now believe,'.' continued Dr.
Beet, "as our' fathers : believed, Mn the
hell-fire pf fifty years ago.' During the
last half century Methodist opinion about
the doom of the lost ; has completely
changed. Very few Wesleyan ministers
can now read Wesley's sermons on 'Hell'
and 'Eternity,' numbers 73 artd 54, with
out repudiating much of their teaching,
with* indignation, and it is worth noting
that, when selecting fifty-three sermons
as containing his distinctive teaching,
Wesley did not include these."
"How is it," I asked, "that so compar
atively little of any radical change in the
Methodist belief reaches the outside
world?"; j\
"This overthrow of the dogma has been
carefully hidden," : replied the doctor.
"Godly ministers . have nursed their
doubts in silence, some under a sense of
guilt for concealing their change of view,
until the need for concealment has be
come to' them" a humiliating and intoler
able bondage. . . In some j cases even men
have not dared tÂ» think, lest the thoughts
they , dared ; ' not utter / should make them
the more conscious of their bondage.": "â¢'
"And is it possible that such sentiments
are at all general?";: \ \u25a0"\u25a0 r .
"This *doubt and fear are very widei
spread^ \u25a0'; There has been a retreat froni
the; position held by our fathers; along
the whole line; for the most part in dark^
ness and solitude. Of all this I have
abundant: and pathetic, proof. Only this
concealment- has -hidden from, the public
gaze . the extent and direction of . the re
treat. - . . : ,
. "I feel â¢ this position \u25a0 to be utterly - dis

the impenitent is ultimate oblivion. I base
my theology upon the Bible itself, and I
say that no one knows. The Bible does
not* say definitely what will be the fate
of the wicked. I am sure- it does not
teach categorically . their endless suffer
ing. My recent studies of the early
fathers convince me that they did not
hold 'it. awhile there are some passage 3
in the | Scriptures . that seem to suggest
conscious suffering, there are many oth
ers that contradict that view, and in the
absence of distinct and' definite teaching
Ido not believe that we have any. Tight
to dogmatize.
"In fact,"- continued Dr. Beet, "the
natural immortality of the wicked is not
a Christian doctrine at all; it has been in
corporated in Christian theology from the
Platonic philosophers, but no proof of
Its truth is to be found in Scripture. Â» -
"These views and ' my reasons for them
I incorporated some years ago "in my
book 'Last Things.' An effort was made
to destroy that book, but they could not
destroy the = fact that everybody knew
that my, opinions about the doom of the
lost were not the same as those held by
our forefathers fifty or sixty years age.
To destroy a book Is not the way to an
swer, it; no, one has even tried to answer
It; no .one." has even met me with an
open Bible. For a time I submitted and
ontinued in my position at the Wesleyan
College at the cost of a temporary sup
pression of the book, although the world
knew as. well as the conference knew my
beliefs. At the last conference I request
ed permission to republish the book, and
the committee appointed to inquire into
the matter came to an agreement which
seemed to me to be fair. But their re
port was, received with great opposition
and something like a storm rose against
me. I saw that it was a question of-giv
ing 'my belief again ,to the ; people or of
resigning. \u25a0 I < resigned. My resignation
was accepted, and I came away Happier

than I had been for a long time. Since
then some. people think I am looking bet
ter; perhaps that is the reason why."
"Does this step of yours in any way
affect your loyalty to the .Methodist
church?" I asked Dr. Beet
; "I will tell you frankly," he replied.
! "that the events of the last eight years
have compelled me to revise my estimate
of some members of .the church.. They
; are not bad people, but they* are very
timid, and in great crises they are very
incapable. This is no time for timidity.
; It is a time of great stress and great un
rest," not merely about 'last things,' but
about the : authority of the Bible and
other things. We cannot escape the dif
ficulty by trying to hold Intact the tra
ditions of the past. But my loyalty to
the church is absolutely unchanged not
for its worthiness^ â we are none of us
worthyâ but for the sake of Christ."
One of the most curious things that
have taken place in relation to the agi
tation created by Dr. Beefs stand is the
reluctance with which the great Metho
dist organs of England have finally taken
sides for or against him. He is too wide
ly known as a scholar, and his works,
which have gone through many editions,
have too strong a hold upon the English
public to admit of any of his statements
being treated lightly. One odd result of
this has been an effort made by the
Methodist Recorder and Methodist
Times, both very powetful papers, each
to interpret "The Last Things" when it
first appeared, according to -Its own
standard. The result was anomalous
and amusing enough, as for instance,
from the" 1 former:
"No writer of the most orthodox and
old-fashioned of. modern churches has
ever shown with more remorseless faith
fulness .the V doom" of sin, wailing -out
from the reluctant sages of the Bible."
And from the latter:
"Those who have mastered the .teach-
ing of this volume will realize that l^le
moves nearly all the objections which de
vout, souls feel to the doctrine "of futur^
punishment." .
ART OF JIAKLXG BOGUS PEARLS.
Is Moat Extensively Imitated of an tfee
Precious Stones. ' .
Among' all precious stones few are so
extensively imitated as the poarL The
real article is a silvesy white, iridescent
J gem. extracted from the pearl oyster. The
genuine pearl is really an unfructrlfled
egg Of the oyster. ItÂ« imitation is ar
rived at by a chemical process. The Ji
quor employed In the manufacture ia
; called essence d'orient The base Â«f thia
; compound Is prepared by throwing intÂ»
water of ammonia the brilliant scales of
a small river flab, called the blay.
The scales are first carefully washeji
and put to soak in water, when the
pearly like film falls trway and forms a
sediment at the bottom of the vessel. This
sediment is worth to the manufacturer $25
an ounce. White wax of mucilage*or gum
arable forms part of the mixture prop<?r
for the* more important and expensive
imitations, such as those made to imitate
the rare Oriental pearls,* which fetch
fabulous prices. . ,
The emerald is another stone which ia

' SOMK 1.A.RG13 FIGURES.
Thomas Magee & Sons, In their Real
Estate Circular, which will be out to
morrow, will report as follows:
"There were S5l sales of real estate
made in the city of San Francisco in
the month of September for a total of
$7,203,020. This breaks all monthly rec
ords by over $300,000, the highest previous,
total being the figures for the month of
June, 1905, when the figures were $6,911,
395. The market continues unusually
active, the sales made showing no de
cided preference for any section of the
city, the activity extending to all sec
tions. Of course, as will be expected,
the' sales in the flfty-vara section lead.
They were fifty-two in number and rep
resented a total of $2,452,600. The largest
sales In this section were of the Frank
property at Market and East and East
and Clay to the Cowell Estate Company
for $500,000; the northeast corner of Jones
and Lewis, 57:6x87, for $120,000; the south
side of Geary street, 137:6, west of Stock
ton; 55x137:6, for $275,000; the south
west corner of Pine and Taylor, 137 :6 x
137:6, for $117,500, and the southeast cor
ner of Montgomery and Commercial
streets, 59:6x103:6, for $250,000.
"The 100-vara section is far above the
average for the rest of the year, show
ing a total of $1,801,365. The largest sales
in, this section are of. the -west side of
East street, between Market and Mission,
91:8x137:6, for $i&0,000; the south side of
Mission strc-et, seventy-five feet west of
First, 80x96:31, for $250,000; wes.t
corner of Seventh and Mission streets.
SSxSO, for $115,000; north corner of Eighth
and Brannan streets, 68:9x275, for Â§139,
000; northeast corner of Fourth and
Natoma streets, 51x117:6, with extra lot
50x70, for $150,008.
â¢ "In the Potrero and South San Fran
cisco sections the sales made are more
numerous and the figures much higher
than has ever been known in this sec
tion, caused by railroad purcrfeses. In
the Mission the sales are up to the high
average of the previous eight months
of the year. In the Western Addition
the figures are higher than ever before,
those for the month showing a
total of $1,566,851: Leading sales in
this section for the month are the
northeast corner of Polk, and Califor
nia streets, 72x100, $90,000; southwest
corner Post and Devisadero streets, 75x
125, sold in trade f0r571,000.; the north

Sutter street, ; 120x120, for. $130,000;
northeast corner of : Pacific avenue and
Broderick street, 137:5x275, for $115,000.
The outside lands and homesteads
sections are somewhat above the aver
age for the past year, showing 308

saVi this morning. -? It ; affects . all : ;the
factories of * the : Algemlene," the Siemens-,

ponies, _ escept ; one - : lamp -% factory, and
throws about 25,000 ; workmen out of ; em
ployment; .As .yet, the' lockout has -not
affected ;. the entire electrical â¢ industry.
But it shows signs of siTreadlnk." * -
*The employes ,of the ; Berlin' Electric
Works, which generates., nearly - all ;,tho
electricity consumed. for. power, and trac
tion purposes ; in . Berlin',- met this evening
to consider a sympathetic strike,. but de
ferred action until Sunday night in order
to a,wait the" result of â¢ a conference : to
be held Sunday morning between : the
three companies affected . and the em
ployes. This conference will be presided
over by Herr Yon Schultz, President of
the Government Arbitration Bureau, but
will have no official character, as the
company refused 'to participate in the
appeal for arbitration. They agreed, how
ever, 1 to meet the labor representatives in
a conference with Herr Yon Schultz:pre
siding. He Is an expert at settling labor
differences, and therefore it is k hoped he
â¢will succeed in stopping the present trou
ble.
The engineers of the Berlin Electric
Works, fearing a sudden strike, arc
spending their entire \u25a0 time in the shops.
The office forcft is being held in order
to operate the machinery*ln case of -a
strike. The suspension of these shops
would stop every car in Berlin, and the
authorities are taking precautions to be
prepared /or a strike. It -has been al
ready arranged to bring a detachment
of machinists from the navy yard at
Kiel in order to keep the works going.
- The lockout this afternoon was effected
innerfect order. The police department
offered to strongly Increase the police
force about, the shops, but the managers
declined. . â¢ .;
The companies desired to retain 60 per
cent of the workmen in order to com
plete present existing contracts, but the
men refused to stay. It . is feared that
Berlin within a few days will have the
largest lockout strike in its history.

ttitvfel and education and went to
s< hool there for two years and spent a
ti irdV in travel with her grandparents.
Il was upon her return to" this country
ii . July, 1904, that she met the rabbi.
J It was an unusual announcement that
read Just before the dispersing of
tiii congregation after an eloquent ser
mon preached by the rabbi: His hear
er:! were all requested to' keep their
seits and Vice -President George Mos
l/iiluher read the following message: .
*'My Dear and Honored Congrega
ttion â You will be pleased to know that
'^U3 new year has ushered a great hap
fc'olness into my life. I am engaged to

1 most respected families in Denver, Colo.
I am very, very happy, and I am sure
you all rejoice in my happiness. Your
faithful and devoted rabbi,
"M. FRIEDLANDER."
The announcement came as a gteat
surprise and a buzz of pleasurable'ex
citement went round the auditorium,
which was crowded with worshipers.
As fast as the people|could r leave their
seats pew after pew was' emptied and
their occupants walked up to grasp
the pastor's hand and the Impromptu
reception was an unusual 'and happy
ending to the meeting. The congrega

the young lady. c

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 30.â A plainly fur
nished bedroom and the simple, diet that
Joseph Lachance gives his patrons at. the
Mount View Hotel, in Ross Valley, for $10
a week, with -"divine- power" treatment
and V lectures thrown in, are not to be
compared with a room and board at the
Hotel Rafael at $3 50 per day, declares
Hampton S. -Field, member of. Hammer
smith & Field, jewelers of San Francisco.
Field, hearing of the "divine power" dis
tributed by Joseph Lachance, took up bis
abode at Ross Valley and was, enrolled as
one of, the healer's patients last Monday.
Field had stomach trouble and had ar
ranged to stay two weeks. But the
change from his accustomed diet to the
diet furnished by Lachance and the lec
tures on divine 'power .and the wonders
that Lachance would do was too much for
him to grin and bear. Friday; his wife
called for him and they, drove to the
Hotel Rafael, where they engaged rooms.
Field says no more divine -healing for

LONDON LAUGHS
AT NEW DRAMA
Gillette's Comedy Receives
Giggles That Its Author
Never Aimed to Provoke
DEEAEY BLANK PAUSES
Intended to Build Dramatic
Effect, They Only Serve
to Make Audience Weary
LONDON. Sept. 30. â William Gillette
as "Sherlock Holmes" made friends
with London, and London was particu
larly well disposed toward aim and bis
comedy, "Clarice," produced . here thia
.week at the Duke of York's Theater
under the i'rohman management. But!
despite all this friendly reeling the first
night was something of an ordeal.
Gillette's nervousness intensified his
peculiarities; hie voice was tense and'
did not carry well at first; and his!
accent worried the gallery, until that
out-spoken portion of the British pub- ,
lie began to grumble. "Speak up," â¢
shouted some one. "Shut up," observed,
other galleryltes to the one who had
thus rudely Interrupted. "Humphl" he
retorted aggressively. "I paid my
money to hear somethlnk and I ain't
hearin' nothink" â a remark not calcu
lated to steady Mr. Gillette's nerves.
There were long silences, too, intended,
no doubt, to heighten the dramatic ef
fect, but successful only in conveying
the idea that the actors had forgotten
their lines and were struggling for a
word wherewith to improvise. These
blank spaces in the dialogue grew so
frequent toward the end of the play
that the audience began to titter. At
the final curtain the applause was more
friendly than enthusiastic, and there
were indications that the pit and gal
lery had it in mind to "boo" If Mr.
Gillette could be tempted out to make
a speech.
Yet there is plenty to enjoy in "Clar
ice." It Mb the old story of the elderly
guardian in love with his adorable lit
tle ward. A : rival \u25a0 convinces him that
he has consumption, and he manfully
sends the girl away. Then it occurs to
the; hero that maybe the wicked rival
was putting up a job on him. and by
pretending that he has taken poison
and' is about to die he induces the
rival to j confess, and all ends happily.
That is about all there is to the plot.
It is in the incidents and tha ingenious
devices of business that the - skilled
hand'of the dramatist is revealed. Par
ticularly successful is the grim old
negro woman -who rules with a rod of
iron and a heart of gold the household
that consists of "Dr. Carrington," the
guardian, ancf '"Clarice," his ward. This
part, played by Lucille La Verne, to
gether with the bewitching beauty of
Marie Doro, who took the title role.
seems likely to contribute more than
anything else, to the measure of suc
cess that the play seems likely to have
when it. settles- down to its gait. In
"Dr. Carrington," Mr. Gillette has pro
videdhimself with- a part that always
seems. to be on the point. of becoming
worthy of the actor, without ever be
coming â¢ anything in particular. The
company, which is" wnolly American,
consists of only six persons, and there
are only two sets of sceneryâ one tha
doctor's living-room, and the other a
room in a -country hotel.
George, Bernard' Shaw recently re
ceived a request .which of all others
was most. calculated to make his blood
boil. He was invited \u25a0' to collaborate
with William j Shakespeare. Of course,
he refused point blank. Tha sugges
tion came from Arthur. Bourchier, who
is meditating a revival at the Garrick.
of "The/ Merchant of Venice." Bour
chier -is considering several, little de
vices "which he" thinks / may. serve to
make the bard's work still more im
pressive, one of them -being a schems
that was utilized by the German Saxe-
Meiningen company, k . which recently
produced '.'The Merchant" . with extra
ordinary success. It-consisted of giving
each supernumerary a certain individ
uality which preserved the background
and atmosphere of the time. Bourchier
thought this mighf be improved on by
supplying the various "supes" with lit
tle characteristic utterances, and it was
these which he asked Mr. Shaw to sup
ply-
In declining to do so, Shaw wrote,
."Collaboration in the theater generally
means fitting your name to a play you

with" another man's play, except on his
own invitation, or at any rate, with his
consent. And the only expressions I
know- characteristic of a Venetian six
teenth century crowd could not possibly
be^ reproduced on the stage at the Gar
rick; without shocking either Catholics
or the Puritans out of their senses."
/Meanwhile Mr. Shaw has been
vouchsafing certain Information re
garding his new and forthcoming play,
"Major Barbara," which he candidly de
scribes as "a, terror." /He says, "It la
simply "an ethical discussion, in three
long acts-;â actually In four, as there
are two scenes In the third. It will be
a public charity , to warn all romantic
playgoers'* to keep away from it, as I
have, thrown them over completely." The
acting will be fine, of ;â¢ course, but the
play is a terror. - It is like the last
scene in 'John' Bull's Other Island,' spun
out i for, three hours and a half. It, will
try ; the faithful extremely."
Doesn't Mr. Shaw want; to: bÂ«Â» taken
seriously by any one? It looks Jthat
way, 'for of .'late he has made almost
as much, fun of; his as
Browning did of the Browningites. Not
long ago iwhen the Actors' Fund peo

PORTLAND, Ore.. Sept 80.â Tha
Federal" Grand Jury returned to-day
an Indictment . against Charles A. 4
Graves. Erwin ' N. Wakefleld. Ora L.

"PORTLAND, Sept. 20.â We wish to
congratulate, you upon your succe3sfuP,

FOUSD IX PARAGUAY â¢
Modeled After Bellamy's "Looking
Backward," but Draw* tbe
"Color Une."
A community which closely, approxi
mates . Bellamy's "Looking Backward"
is Cosme, a little settlement near Asun
cion.. Paraguay, described by Wilhelzn
Lacmann In the Lelpaic Grenzbdten.
Equality, democracy and community of
wealth and work are the principles on
which it was founded in 1594 by a split
in a colony of Australian â¢â¢immigrants
to Paraguay. The houses o*. the set
tlers lie together and form a small vil
lage, . and are small, pretty and dean;
they have only one story and are built
of boards and shingled or roofed with
mazega grass. The roof hangs far over
the side walla and is . supported by
posts, a detail which allows for -a wide
verandaâ -a _ most welcome adjunct In
the hot weather. On one side *of the
house is a small ; outbuilding which
contains the kitchen, and every house
has its garden. Little of
sugar cane lie between the houses and
gardens.
Up to tha presen the dwelling
houses cover only a quarter of \u25a0 tha ,l, l
space which has been reserved for thY
village, and when Herr Lacmann
visited the place there - were sozna
twenty houses occupied and 103 in
course of erection. In time the build-
Ings will form a great square, which
j will 'lie about a larger open squar*. ..la.
addition a number of . smaller publics
places have been provided for,- which
will He, as those already in existence,
between the houses. There Is an abso
lute community of goods In Cosme, the
only exception being that objects, of
household or personal use â furniture,
cooking utensils, clothing and food
remain tha property of their uaers.
When one enters the colony <he must
bring his entire property In with these
exceptions. When, however, one wishes
to withdraw he does not receive back
the amount of his contribution, but
only the amount which corresponds to
his share for the last working period.
" Every one . must go through a pro
bationary period of one year, and;be
fore this period is completed no mem
bership Is obtained nor any contribu
tion of goods made. - Every applicant \u25a0
upon entering must pay into the treas
ury $25 for each adult member of the
family and half of this amount for each
child. If then the probationers decide â¢
not to remain in the colony their .ex
penses to Buenos Ayres are; paid,* but
this is not done unless the applicant re

staying- recently at Dunachton in Scot
land as the guests of James Henry
Smith and his sister. Lady Cooper.
When in the Highlands the Duke al

which closely resembles that of the

.ue noticed that many of the natives
eyed his legs closely. ~ He endured their
scrutiny with much complacency, attri
buting it to the fact that he possesses
a rather shapely pair of calves to the
display of which the Highland costume
specially lends itself. But his pride
received a shock when an old gillie told
him that attention had been attracted
to his nether limbs because 'he was
\u25a0wearing: the "sgian dubh"â the littre
black knife stuck in the stockingâ on
his left leg instead of, the right, as
prescribed by Highland custom. "An'

LONDON, Sept. 30.â Nearly aswee3ca 5 wee3c
has passed since the body of Miss Mary
Money of "Clapham Junction was found
in the Merstham tunnel of the' London
and Southwestern ' Railroad, but the
mystery of her death remains unsolved.
The outrage, however, has served to
start a crusade .against the continued

on the British, railroads. At least one
main line is said to have countermanded
a large order for old-type cars in con
sequence of the crusade.
Sir Conan Doyle was asked in his ca
pacity of "Sherlock Holmes" to give his
opinion of the tunnel tragedy. He de
clined, but warmly denounced the pres
ent style of car ' and lack of protection
for women traveling alone. He said: ,
t "I think if perfectly scandalous that
such a state of affairs should be al
lowed to exist. Any "railroad company
not reserving at least one carriage fO5f 05
ladies on every train ought to be held
responsible and pay compensation where
a woman is murdered."

HUSBAND'S - OLJTICAL FUTURE
\IS GIVING. HER MUCH WOIIRY
Lady ! Curzon Sadly Missen the Glamor
of Her Former K\a Hod
Social Position. V
LONDON, Sept. .30. â Lady Curzon's
friends say that she is t worrying a
good deal over her husband's political
future. . He can, hardly -expect ever
again to attain to a position of such
prominence and power as that of Vice
roy of: India, especially as he retires
from it somewhat under; an eclipse.
Like 'most : American women who have
married clever she is even
more a'mbitioiis than "her husband.
When she first went to India she* wa3
subjected to a deal of ridicule because
she insisted on being styled "Vi
cereine," despite the fact that the
wives of former ' Viceroys had not
claimed that privilege.
- A young British officer, told me the
other day thaf a. friend of "his, in the
same regiment,- was one- day lunching
with the Curzons at Government House.
He chanced to refer to his hostess: as
Lady Curzon and throughout ; the rest
qf the meal he wondered /what on earth
he had done thaUshe 'should treat him
sp frigidly. It fell, to the lot of Lord
Suffolk to explain, to him. how he had
put ;his foot in^it.' But he never got
a chance to profit by the information,
for he , was notjagain invited to Gov

Lady. Curzon would have ' enjoyed a
greater popularity in India if she -had
stood less on her dignity, but inclainv
ing to 'share her/ husband's' title- and
shine in his reflected glory, .she was
merely following the custom that ob-'
tains in England -from royalty down

AT A CONCERT AND BALL
More Than Three Thousand People At
tend Annual 'Festival of â¢ the .^vy
Gaelic Dancing Club. '. \u0084
The Gaelic Dancing Cliib ; scored a de
cided trimph last night: More :than 3000'
people attended Its fifth annual concert
and ball and the programme. was an ex
cellent one, so thoroughly Irishj as to
arouse decided enthusiasm. There was
a great display of flags andvbunting,
Irish mottoes and harps 'and shamrocks
and hundreds of electric lights. -Every
seat on the main floor was occupied and
the aisles were^also filled with:specta
tors. For the" Gaelic dancing- a special
platform had been built.
: Owing to the crowd and the poor
acoustic properties "of the .Pavilion it
was decided to omit any opening; ad
dress or exercises, and the flrst.partof
the programme was confined : to aVvery
fine stereopticon exhibit of Irish views..
Many of the scenes familiar to the peo
ple present received hearty applause.
Then followed the j special % four-hand
reel, danced alternately by the Misses
Bessie and Hazel Allen and Joseph P.'
Kelleher , and John; O'Connell. ';' Then
came the children's exhibition, a Some"
300 little ones garbed 'hi white and
green marched and countermarched and
finally danced all together a lively, Irish
step to the delight of the spectators. A
special eight-hand reel followed )\u25a0 with
the same dancers as above and in addi
tion Pearl- Allen, Clara ' Coyne, D. . Cot^
ter and M. O'Connell. This rollicking:
Irish dance was loudly applauded. '
The grand march was held baok for a
considerable time awaiting Uhe Mayor.
Finally the Mayor' arrived' and, ; with
Mrs. Schmitz, the i march .was .started
and it was a beautiful- spectacle,^with
the Gaelic Dancing Club In costume, the
children and about 200; couples wearing
the club f avors.v; lt was . too '?. merry â¢ a
crowd? for politics tol out any figure, al-^
though ; the politicians , were * there i' in'
force, but Mrs.- Schmitz received a- right ,
hearty - welcome, f: - She Â£>as ;*' simply
attired in white silk, with' lrish point
and without ornaments. v>White* f rose-:
buds : In berl dark hair ' gave ; a contrast^
and the lime light made her aconspicu-'
ous figure during the long march.'Danc

some sum for the Irish language: as
well as for. the club.

That the i Ex-Police' Chief
Is - Finally: of Office
XSANNOT vEEVIEW GASE
If olds^That So JLong. as Board
{Follow^ V the Charter an
" Appeal ' ;^ill Not Lie
Superior,: Judge Hunt handed j down an
opinion yesterday sustaining the action of
the Board of 4 Police Commissioners in
dismissing 'George I W.: Wlttman [ from the
office of * Chief "of Police. I The court does
not. go -into 'the merit* of ; the charges
against Wittman, holding that it is pow
erless to -review, the evidence and that the
action of the board Is final, as It followed
to ; the ; letter ', the mode *of procedure set
forth lln ; the . charter. the
charges , upon ; which : Wittman was dis
missed were true ;or false, he is without
further remedy, concludes the court! 'for
the charter vests the board, and It alone,
with . power" to determine the merits of
such charges. The court, however, holds
that ..Wittman's Â» suspension g from office
prior to the filing: of charges against .him
was Illegal,' and he is given judgment for
the salary that accrued during the period
of such ; suspension,* which' extended from
February â¢1 : to March , 24 of this year.
Whether Wittman will appeal to the Su
preme Court has not yet been determined.
Judge Hunt in his decision says:
< "When an officer of the Police Depart
ment Is charged with misconduct or unflt
ness'for'office it might ;well be that the
interests of 'public Justice would be con
served by. his suspension from duty dur
ing the trial upon such charges.
"This .suspension, however, was not
made upon the preferment of oharges
against the petitionerâ nor. pending the
trial j upon : such chargesâ nor . was it
ordered v by? way of punishmentâ rnor
was it limited * or ; conditioned aa to
timeâ but .: oh the , contrary.. It . was a
suspension In anticipation, of ; charges,
in advance of trial and before-judg
ment, and,. In duration, : it might
sibly have continued ; for the/remain
der of his supposed term .of office,' and
on the*a grounds the suspension ;of
petitioner was Illegal. ' - './..,
"As : I understand â¢â¢ the^ contention ' of
counsel, it is not claimed, that; if.: pe T
tltloner had proven incompetent; or un
fit to perform the duties.of' his; office,
he could not have been- ren>rved"Â»untll
the expiration of four, years; a>ut>';lf
such is the contention ! 'lt "is manifest
that the power [of j removal; under, such
circumstances exists.,. The 'members: of
the ',:\u25a0 commission .;' are:; themselves yap
polntedt-for; a\ term- of four â¢ years; but
the' right "of , the' Mayor to' remove â¢ a
member , for cause has been judicially
established, 141 Cal. 316. If. therefore,
the commission in this 'instance had
jurisdiction ,; to institute - and conduct
the proceedings resulting in the 're
moval of the petitioner,'* the courts are
powerless to interfere.
. Three members \of â¢\u25a0 the : board â¢ partici
pated in :the trial in determination of
the . charges.V against ; petitioner â hence
a .quorum Â«â¢ of i the board 'was present,
and themajorlty of ,a' quorum^may act.
."The -charge which \ was' made
against;. him of official- Incompetency
-was ;such lasl the, boardt had 'power to
investigate; .he/was afforded sufficient
time .to^produce "this '^.witnesses; i much

he " was t guilty and with "i that; conclu
sion, 'whether, right' for -w wrong, this

"It is" therefore ordered 4 that the
prayer of the petitioner, for a writ of
mandate, Tcompelling the board to ad
mit the* plaintiff; to the.offlce of - Chief
of Police be denied.
V "In the' action'lnstituted by the "pe

LINER ALAMEDA GOES HARD AND FAST
ON FORT POINT IN A HEAVY FOG.
The Oceanic Steamship Company* s liner Alameda, outward bciind jor Horn at Fort Point shortly before noon yesterday during
a dense fog. No lives were lost. \ The pilot says that no Jog whistles were blown by the stations eit her at 'wLitmefPotnt'i or at Fort Pointy until after , the Alameda was ashore. A man who
claims to have been in the \ Lime Point station declares the Lime Point man in charge did 'not start getting steam on his whistle until ajter he heard the Alameda 's signals of distress.
PROBALITIES ARE THAT THE VESSEL CANNOT BE SAVED
All Are Sent Ashore Safely and
. Without Discomfort.
WHISTLES ARE NOT SObNDED

VESSEL STILL ON THE ROCKS
The Oceaflic Steamship Company's liner
A'.ameda, -with Captain Thomas Dowdell
In. comamna and Pilot C. B. Johnson di
recting her course, went hard and fast
ashore shortly before noon yesterday on
- the rocks off Fort Point. She was out-.
ward bound for Honolulu, and In addition
cvÂ» a valuable cargo had on board thirty-
passengers.
No lives were lost and there was not at
\u25a0 any time any sign of panic.
. The passengers were transferred In
safety and without discomfort to the rev
' taiue cutter Golden Gate, which later
. landed them at Pacific street wharf.
' . -A-t an early hour this morning: the pros
pects were very discouraging as to saving
the proud steamship. No attempt was
nSade" to xÂ»ull her on! the rocks, for the
water had flooded . the engine-room and
put .out the fires. During the ebb of the
tide the Alameda had pounded on the
â¢ reef and the water poured In so fast that
the plans to gtt her off the rocks during
â¢â¢high tide at midnight were abandoned.
â¢ KfYorts will now be bent to salvage*
.uf the cnr^,Mia the ship-s fittings. The
jucgnitni of thuse who* inspected the yes-Â«
Bel last night was that she could not be
saved. â
-The vessel -went ashore during a heavy
fog. which shut down suddenly and lifted
almost as quickly, but after the damage,
had been done. The lifting of the fog
\u25a0however, greatly facilitated the work of
rescuing the passengers, which was done
skiilfully and expeditiously.
One passenger well described the de
barkation when she remarked as she
..cached the Golden Gate: "This is the
most delightful shipwreck I was ever in."
â¢ yo PANIC OX BOARD SHIP.
Fortunately for all concerned the Ala
int<^ carried an all-white crew and Cap-
Jk~ ; ~ Dowdell and his officers had no pan-
I^-Mricken Asiatics to ttraighten out be
â¢ \u25a0 tore .giving their attention to the passen
gers and the ship.
. The Alameda left Pacific-street wharf
at 11 a. m. The sun was shining brightly
in a blue-sky and a slight haze overhang
ing the heads was the only evidence of
â¢fng visible when the liner straightened
out on her course. As she passed the
Presidio the mists suddenly swept In
from the sea and the Alameda was in the
midst of a thick fog. Pilot Johnson gave
orders to slow down, and he and Captain
fcowdell listened for the guiding sound of
?uher LAme Point or Fort Point fog
whistles.
As they listened the liner was caught by
a -swirl of the flood tide and carried
toward the rocks where she now rests.
fche struck gently. Few of the passen
gers had any idea that the vessel was
aground. When the engines stopped
raost of the passengers thought the stop
.. had been made to let on! the pilot, and it
â¢ was only when the fog lifted that they
â¢ ,caw the fort looming up over the bow
ti:at they knew why the Alameda was
no longer going ahead. y Â¥ '
PRAISE FOR THE OFFICERS.
All on board join in paying a tribute to
Captain [ Dowdell's coolness, which was
largely responsible for the calm way in
m which the passengers met the situation
. when they learned the worst. The disci
pline was perfect. Every officer, every
flj man and boy did his duty, and so effec
g|Wj that fifteen minutes after the Ala
<rÂ»^a struck the passengers riled into the
dining saloon and ate luncheon with
touch more composure than some of them
" could have command .d had she been out
among the off-shore swells.
; After luncheon the passengers were
â¢- quictiy told to pack up their grips and
wraps many of them were unpacking
. whren the liner struck and prepare to
.leave the ship. There was no hurry, no
excitement.
A lew seconds after the liner struck, one i
â¢ of the whistles, for a sound of which her
â¢ navigators had been straining their ears,
; was heard right ahead. It was the Fort
â¢Point fog Bignal. Five minutes later the
â¢ whistle at Lime Point blew a mocking
â¢ blast. Meanwhile the ; Alameda's own
w'hlstle was shrieking, and in response to |
her" signals of distress boats were
launched from the Government life-sav
ing stations at Fort Point, Point Bonita !
and the Golden Gate station. The Fort I
-Point crew, under Captain Carlson, was!
the first to reach the Alameda. i
PASSENGERS TAKEX ASHORE.
V. Then the fog cleared and the Point Bo
nita life-savers, under Captain Nutter,
reached the scene. , Captain Varney's
crew, from the Golden Gate station, i
was alongside shortly after. !
* By one of the lifeboats a request for as- j
6iÂ§tance. was sent ashore and telephoned
to the city. In a little more than an hoar
after the Alameda. struck the. passengers
were all on board \u25a0 tne Golden Gate!com
fortably, watching the effort* being made
tc drag the liner from the rock's. In less
than four hours hope of getting her afloat '
untlT the next; nigh' tide had been aban
doned. Lighters were alongside tojreceive
TV* cargo end powerful tugs were stand
ihz by to render such aid as they could.
When .word was received of the Ala
xneda's plight' all the Spreckels tugs were ;
away. The Sea Prince, Sea Fox, Sea

Rover and Sea Queen of the Merchants'
and Shipowners* Company were Â»dis- ;
patched to the scene, and later the Pa- |
clflc Mail Company sent the tug Arabs
and Major Devol dispatched the army tug
Slocum. It was almost high tide, how
ever, when the Alameda struck. The red
stack boats were unable to stir her, and
when the Arabs and Slocum reached {he
scene the tide had fallen so much that it
would have been useless to try any more
pulling on the stranded vessel. " .

to the rail, and a step down to the. deck
of the stanch ' little revenue cutter

saying. "Welcome on board, ladies and

This ship is yours." It was the easiest

One of Hhe" lifeboats was â¢ carried by

three tugs were straining, and ' it was

from under all right,, however, -and; *a

tators of . the ; Wreck. . .l. l
Pemberton Jones, ,the well-known
New York society leader, and his
daughter, who are' guests at â¢ the St.
Francis Hotel, were probably the first
on shore to foresee the fate of the Ala
meda. Under the guidance of House
Detective Hershey of , the St. Francis
they had gone to the Presidio in an
automobile and were standing on the
bluff ; adjacent . .to â¢ old ' Fort Point
when Jones and his daughter suddenly
detected J through . the fog below the
black outline of the Alameda heading
for the shore.
"That's peculiar," remarked Jones ] to
his daughter and Detective Hershey.
"Certainly that vessel has lost her
course or she is making for some
wharf below us."
A few seconds later the \u25a0.Alameda
suddenly stopped in her course, and,
hardly had the fact been noted by the
observers on the bluff, before ' they
heard; a rumbling sound \ : and .quickly
realized that the vessel had struck' on
the rocks. : A few minutes later.' the
fog lifted and the trio of- spectators
above the scene of the wreck were fur

hanging. fast on the rock below them.

His â¢ Statement for the
Government Investigation
Captain Thomas Dowdell, commander
Of the Alameda, has little to say about
the affair. The pilot was handling the
liner, and it was under the pilot's direc
tion that she rammed her nose, in
tmong the breakers. Captain Dowdell
rias a splendid reputation for careful
eeamanship, and there is no reason to
believe yesterday's disaster was due to
eny relaxation of his usual vigilance. He
reserves anything he might have to say
for his owners and the Government in
spector. Pilot C. B. Johnson is not so
reticent. #
"It all comes," be "said yesterday on
board the Alameda, "of doing a friend
a favor. I took this ship out of my turn
to oblige Newt Jordan. And see the re
sult."
That, however, is only the pilot's sen
timental reason for the disaster.
"The - responsibility," he says, "rests
entirely upon the people at Lime Point.
Their whistle was not blowing, although
it was so thick for a time that I couldn't
Â»cc the length of the Alameda. We got
lost in the fog and I listened for the
whistle to give me my bearings. When
the â¢ whistle did blow we had been
asftore, for five minutes."

merchants of St. Louis.
"We were standing on the deck." said
Mr. Nugent, "determined to ccc as much
Â«ls we could, despite the heavy fog
which hung over us. We could_ not see
the length of the ship and I \vas about
to go below when the crash came.
"At first I thought that we had hit
a rock in deep water and that we
would go down. Then the fog lifted
and I saw that we were in a stone's
throw of land. Very few were badly
frightened for more than that first
minute. In fact, it was the calmest
crowd I have ever seen in times of
danger. The crew and the officers in
spired confidence and we were soon
landed.
"I am sorry that the accident hap
pened and I do not know whether.it is

here from St. Louis all right and I hope
that, thi* accident does not mean that

all looked happy and cheerful and,ap

been hung up on the rocks. The Golden

When the Fuciftc Mai! liner Rio dp
Janeiro went down not very far from
vheie the Alameda Mruck yesterday,
the horrors of the situation were ajug
mented by the fact that the Chlneao
crew were not only panic-stricken, but
were unable to understand the orders
given by their white officers. This, at a
time .when precious lives depended upon
the maintenance of the strictest disci
pline and prompt obedience, was doubt
less a contributing cause to the heavy
death roll which marked the loss of the
Rio. -
When the Algoa went ashore some
months ago while coming In. from sea,
before they could give any attention to
the ship the officers had to drive the
panic-stricken Asiatics out of the boats
they were madly trying to launch and
with kicks and blows compel them to
return to the Btations they had de
serted.
The Alameda carries an all-white*
crew, the advantage of which, is evident
In comparing the absolute tranquillity
which was maintained yesterday when
she went' ashore with the wild disorder
on the Pacific Mail's Chinese-manned
vessels. The passengers , who cass
ashore from the- Alameda say that via
far as the officers and crew were con
cerned the unexpected endlns of the trio
at Fort Point might have been part
of the Alameda's regular programme..
There was no loud shouting, no- running
about.
When the vessel struck the crew
quietly but af.lckly assembled at their
boat stations and within a few minutes
all the bonts were cleared and, swung .

XÂ»i*e- their absence the Berkeley players
h*e not the slightest difSculty la laying
'iow the mea from the south. First down
iStim made but three times during the
jk~>>r* time of play by St. Vincent and
â¢^ly tl^rteen plays with thÂ« ball were
"made by the visitors In the game.
â¢. Tis fact that St. Vincent was easr
\u25a0tor Use varsity, so easy that the game
.etfeld hardly be called a contest. Induced
â¢the crowd to give most attention to
rwatchlnc the new style of play developed
in the varelty team by Coach Knibbs,
\u25a0cf- Dartmouth. Spectators, most cf whom
were thoroughly familiar with the old
'ftylA of play, speedily discerned that
Coach Knibbs is is the act of working
.oct an evolution which, when it is fin
ished, will result In the adoption cf an
feilrtlr new style of football at the uni
â¢verslty. Speedy work Is evidently Knibbs*
htfbby. He put Quarterback Whitman in
the rÂ«-=Â« the first half and Whitman
Jwpt th* team fairly on the jump, sig
nals being given with lightning lik*
raplfiity. while- plays cam* so Quick and
fast that the St. Vincent aggregation was
carried completely off Its feet.
Soothe, the Quarterback last year for
tie varsity, went In during: the second
.half and probably did as well as he
worked last year, but his lack of speed,
to- comparison with that shown in the
f.rÂ« half, brought Ceach Knibbs to the
frost with cries for "faster work." Speed
enÂ£ "speed and yet. -more speed is de
manded by the Dartmouth coach. It Is
.evident from to-day's game, the first of
the season for the varsity, that only the
men who are able to stand a lightning
fast pace will get consideration from
-Coach Knibbs wnen he comes to the
work of framing up the list of men for
tta* big" game with Stanford in November,
marked feature of the style
<ifp:ay developed by the new coach is
that the men are prepared to play high
instead of low. Last year and in other
\u25a0yprjs the California eleven played the
â¢few -style -of game, ploughing into the
f;-rh'. lying low all the time. Now the :
.rp.n-j.re on their feet all the time, work

FOOTBALL GIANTS ARE LINING UP
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept. 30.-
The varsity football aquad took the eleven
from the "Willamette University into camp
to- day by the decisive score of 12-0. The
aides were well matched. "Willamette hav
ing considerable more weight, which the
cardinal players counterbalanced by their
opeed.
The showing is highly encouraging for
all the Stanfordltes. Never before has a
cardinal eleven showed such results after
being In the field but three weeks. On de
fensive and offensive work the training
and coaching of Lanagan were shown to
advantage. The visitors were able to
make but â¢ small headway through tfce
line, but by mass plays outside of tackle
netted considerable gains. It seemed they
had'an excellent chance %o score had it
not been for careless fumbles.
Star players upon the cardinal side were
many. .Crowe, the stalwart fullback, \
\u25a0was time after time shoved through for
gains. Upon the defense he was equally
proficient, being the stumbling block for
many a Willamette back who had slipped j
past the line. Fenton, who played the j
greater part of the game as quarterback, j
was the hero of the bleacherites. â¢ He j
showed fine head work, making numerous |
long rune on delayed passes. . He also j
made several creditable attempts at a
field goal. . i
The game started with "Willamette
kicking to Stanford. The ball was ad
vanced and In the first five minutes
pushed over for a touchdown by the al
ternate work of Crowe, Chalmers and
Dole. Crowe being responsible for the"
touchdown. Dole kicked the goal. Score.
6 to 0.
Stanford then kicked to the visitors and
the ball seesawed about until the end of
the half, the ball then being in the pos
session of Willamette at the center of the
field.
In the second half Stanford worked the
ball to the twenty- yard line, and it was
then given to Fenton for a drop-kick field
goaL The ball fell short by a small mar
gin and Willamette ran it in ten yards.
Stanford held and Willamette punted out.
Vandervoort of the cardinal back field
running it back to the twenty-five-yard
line, Fenton again tried' for a field goal,
but failed. Willamette again punted cut
of danger, \u0084
By brilliant work of the cardinal back
field the ball was brought to the twenty
yard line and, for the third time, Fenton
took the ball for a field goal. The pass
was poor and the attempt was blocked.
Fenton regained possession of the pig
skin. Bucking tactics were then employed,
bit Willamette held for downs. After an
exchange of punts Stanford obtained the
ball on the ten-yard line from the vislt
| ors, and Slusher at fullback was put over
S the line on Eeveral successful plunges.

The easiest 'thing the men from" the
Varhras r schools ~ seemed * to ' do " was >-. to
break In the fif ty-yara dash.'
Sites'of Oakland tied. the record, running
in ; the fast time of 5*L \ seconds. The
quarter-mile I record.^ which was- held " by
La Valliere of Oakland, was lowered to
53^-1 seconds by "Walker of the ' same
school.' Vail, the Oakland : pole vaulter,
disdnguished"' himself by raising his I rec
ord '- of 10 ' feet 4 finches to 10 feet- U^

\u25a0'. "'rushed over to her and clapped his hand

SCANDAL RACKS
ILLINOIS TOWN
It Begins With Virtual
.. Hurder of Servant Girl
in Home of Wealthy Man
'. "CHICAGO, Sept. 30.â Details of a series
pf sensations which are alleged to have
Smoldered for months in Cambridge, IIL.
jÃnd. which may explain tbe mysterious
death of John V. Streed, a prominent
attorney and politician who was found
-lifeless at his office door in Cambridge
*Â» week ago with a bullet through his
tiead, were revealed here 10-day.
â¢ Dr. Byrd C Powell, a veterinary sur
geon* of Sandwich, 111., came to Cbicdfeo
and told a story running back of the
recent suicide of his brothtr, .Wiliiam D.
Powell of Cambridge. The story dis
closes a chain of facts connecting the
Powell and Streed cases with the vir
tual murder of a Swedish domestic in the
home of a wealthy and prominent man
at Cambridge more than five years ago.
She was buried secretly,- without death
certificate or inquest. In the opinion of
Dr. Powell, Attorney Streed was mur
dered bt cause Strecd knew the truth be-,
hind the woman's death. Strecd got the
facts from William D. Powell, who com
mitted suicide August 26 last, after Mr.
Powell's home had been broken up and
the guilty ptrsons shielded. It is alleged,
by influential political friends. Dr. Pow
ell declares his brother was driven to
his death by a clique at Cambridge. He
suspected several men of prominence of
being too friendly with his wife and enÂ»
countered as a result persecution which
it is, said drove him to suicide.
Finally Powell awoke one morning to
find "Tar and Feathers" written on his
door, with a note ordering' him to leave
town within four days or suffer violence
at the hands of a mob. Then Powell
summoned his brother. William detailed
the story of his sufferings, of his love
for tiis wife, the persecutions and the
threat of death.
"What shall I do?" he asked in des
pair.
"Go after them," replied his adviser..
"You know something of the death of
this Swedish girl. The men persecuting
you "are involved in that case. Go after,
them."
Two detectives arrived at Cambridge
as a result to work up evidence in refer
ence to the death of the domestic W
D. Powell took the evidence to Attorney
Streed and asked him to prosecute the
men. Streed refused to do It, because
It Involved some of his best friends. Wil
liam D. Powell's suicide followed. Dr.
Powell believes that Streed and some of
th<Â» suspected men quamled and in the
heat of dispute Streed betrayed knowl
Â«M3ge of the domestic tragedy.
"My brother." said Dr. Powell to-day,
â¢was hounded to death by a clique of
men who control tverything in the ad
ministration of law in Cambridge. If
Slrec-d was murdered, it Is a simple mat
ter for the . Cambridge . authorities to
figure out who are the persons interested
in bringing about his death; but they
hav<Â» purposely suppressed the truth,
which, if revealed, may lead to the dis
covery of StreedV murderer and bring to
light another murder.

ANGELS ALL HIT HAEI)
Victory Is Easy for Them
I After They Usher In: the
f. Game With Four Tallies
The Angels have acquired that habit
of making \ monkeys out of \u25a0 the : Seals.
At ; that it Is: not sueh 1 a, difficult. task,
but when one team can do it, three
times without falling down; it is sure
ly \u25a0 t some % baseball. â¢\u25a0 The work was
easier Uhan-ever yesterday at Recrea
tion Park, for the game .was about
broken up ere \ the first : spasm ended. V
Walter Nagle, king" of bush pitchers
arid expert' handler of gold
money, took a day off from the bank
and i passed the time away " in ' buf
faloing the Seals instead of examining
phony, checks and things. , Nagle
should: have made it a blank, but the
Angel fielders were wont to boot many
chances. In , this way the Seals made
three runs which they did .not figure
to deserve.' .',;''\u25a0 . \u25a0 , \u25a0..-\u25a0
The Angels ushered that first round
in like a flock of eight- time pennant
winners. .Bernard walked and Flpod
and Smith Â»beat out. infield hits. Bras
hear dumped: one out to short center,
scoring the: first two men. , Mohler
booted Dillon's grounder ' and another
arrived. : Wilson became afflicted with
the jimmies at this stage of the -game
and his; passed ball allowed Brashear
to ring the bell. '
.For a couple of rounds the Angels
had' mercy on Henley. In the fifth
they -bogari' to open , up . on him once
again and from that time till the end
of the game It was one volley of
doubles and singles after another till
the ten mark was reached. Every
man on theteam was hitting. Brashear
was the king of the flock .with a dou
ble and two singles. . \u25a0 :i
Jud Smith suffered from hard' luck
and several other things at the third
station. He was booting everything
that came along and but' for this Nagle
would have made it a clean blank. In
the^ixth-Nealon beat one to third that
Smith had grabbed. Householder made
a clean': single to right and . Irwin
walked. Again the ball . was chopped
to: third and again it was too difficult
for Smith ; and a run waj the result.
With two' down and Mohler and Hil
debrand on the paths, Ross dropped
Nealon's . long fly in the seventh and
both men chased themselves home.

Dr. McLaughlin â Dear Sir: I cannot find words to express my grr*tltudÂ« to
you for the help your Belt has been to me. I followed your directions,, wearing
the Belt every night, and gradually, one by one, every symptom of my trouble
disappeared. The lame back, the tendency toward billiousnrsÃ. and what used to
trouble me most, the kidney complaint, are all gone. I put tne Belt aside Â«omÂ»
time ago, but there Is no sign of the trouble returning:. I cannot give your Belt
too much praise for the good It has done me, and have told many of my friends
of the benefits r received from It. It Is truly a Godsend to mankind. Wishing
you continued success In your good work, I remain yours gratefully

Do you notice how enthusiastic my patients seem to be? See the
praise they give me! They are all men full of an idea, overflowing with
expression, just as any one who is immensely pleased.
If you have been paying money to doctors and taking nasty drugs
for years, and after getting no benefit from It all you find a new iease on
life after using ray Belt for a month, you will be enthusiastic, too You
will want to, go out on the highways and shout, and you won't care who
knows that you were once a weakling, because^ now you are cured and a.
Why say more? Isn't this enough? Aren't you convinced that I can
cure you? if you want more proof, tell me where you axe and I can
eive you names of people near you. You can see them and ask them
what I have done for them. The word of an honest man cured is worth
more than all. argument, and I have thousands pf them.
Xow don't delay. Enjoy all the happiness you may In this world.
You can have none without health- and strength.

MONEY EXPERTS
ARE MYSTIFIED
\ Bank . 1 Statement;

;qu eer -discrepancies;
\u25a0 NEW YORK,' Sept.'; 30.â The. j weekly,
bank statement was the " center ,'ofinter-^
est .to-day und -published .'intimations; of:
its favorable character,: .were*, circulated'
before ( the statement * itself ,1 appeared.";
Prices', advanced 'accordingly, "and; while
some \u25a0 hesitation- developed . in jj the' closing]
ton^, last" prices were ' near, tlie - best. % . i
/ The bank 'statement : has been:
subject to criticism, "for *as long 1 tifhe as :
an inadequate showing* of the actual. cbn-^
ditlon off the banks,- principally- on;ac-:
count of ;the.; operation of: the 'system -of
computation", by â¢ daily .averages.* : But . the*
skepticism which found -.expression over
to-day's statement was unusually ' frank"
and general; pwing to the extreme varia-^
tion from, the â¢ estimated ''result. --The
known movements of money for the week
promised a decline. inthe cash* reserve of;
more than $6,000,000. â¢ The Â» bank | state
ment on the contrary indicates,"' an 'in-,
crease of $1,522,300. The extraordinary
requirements of the week fforr r syndicate
payments, . quarterly settlements^ and ) the
New York . tax payments to be made 'Mon
day/ promised, an unusually heavy demand
for credits. .The' loan item, of -the Jbank
statement, on . the contrary, shows a con
traction of $4,810,300. --...The net result": is.
to expand the margin' of the surplus by
$2,204,1)75. . \u25a0; . . . . " V -
Expert authorities are entirely at a loss
to find- any explanation,, for these-dis
crepancies. In the r matter of v the cash
item, it is suggested that the gold en
gagements for import may have .been
made to figure in that item on the supply
being secured abroad and without waiting
for the receipts : of the actual metal. It
is said that this is th^ custom of
the. Bank, of France and some: other
| foreign banks. 1 Last night's steamer
fiom England brought $2,250,000 in' gold,
which wouid nat tigiire normally in the
bank statement until next week. Con
fusion in the loan item after great trans
actions is explainable when the period of
settlement comes in the^middle of the
week, owing to the working of the aver-;
age system. -But with the settlement
coming at the end of the bank week the
full effect of the loan operations would
be expected "to be reflected in the bank
statement. .
The speculative operators In stocks-ac
cepted the statement at its face value.
Feeling among them was confident also
that the maximum effect of the October
Ist settlement was- shown in yesterday's
money market and that: easier conditions
will be felt next week. The heavy ad
justments made â¢ were reflected in the
day's record, clearing-house balances,
which amounted, to $33,995,573, exceeding
the greatest previous record by more than
$3,000,000. '. ' / â¢ .
Yesterday's increase in the t Railway
Steel Spring dividend stimulated a num
ber of low-priced industrials. The princi
pal movement otherwise\was that in the
Reading stocks. '.
Total sales of bonds, par value, $1,
145,000. :;
. DEAMXGS SHOW SHRINKAGE.
The volume of , dealings in stocks this
week has shown-. a shrinkage ,from :day
to day under the constraining influence of
diminishing supplies In -the -money* mar
ket.'. A moderate s effect was produced- In
prices, but the decline was no t% steadily
pursued, and strength from . time to time
in special stocks^ served as a, sustaining
Influence on the general list. ;: The : factors
in the money market were so accurately
known and the i effect so early foreseen
that there has riot j uncovered any. weak
position up to this time.'; The feeling has
been prevalent ; that the special demands
being met this | week in the money mar
ket were of a' kind which would be tem
porary In their effect; and the hope has
been held that the r supplies j accumulated
for meeting great syndicate transactions
would flow back, quickly into the money
market with the conclusion of those
transactions. ; The . payment of subscrip
tions ; to . the : Pennsylvania" and Atchison
convertible bond â issues has ' been | the
special operations making the largest de
mands which, are; to Jbe met to-day, and
an extensive shifting of , loans has gone
on during, the week in preparation for
these pay ments t and f or the October . Ist
quarterly settlements, which are unusual
ly large. \:-; /'\u25a0 '
Aside from these special ' require j '
ments, demands^oh bank reserves have
continued large with every, prospect of

HIS MAJESTY'S REPLY
"â¢BERLIN. 30.â An amusing story
is 'g'biug* about.at the expense j of : an
'', American- politician who' was recently ro-j
ceived -in audience" by the: Emperor. â¢' :-0 i
\u25a0 This ' \u25a0 representative 'of j ; the - United"

a designation would be f pleasing '* to' the 4
Kmperof. .- Tlil3,\ : however, was /not: the^
case. The Kaiser instructed that the re-,

:','His imperial ; Majesty; .the -Emperor,'
recognizes arid , appreciates highly a Ger-;
man or an r American; but such V^thing
as a'Gcrmah-American, according^to^ the
imperial; view; "does 'not exist. If, there-
fore,:you i_willf make application either a3
an American or German; it will doubtless
be granted."/ "\u25a0 -. .
persisting . for some> time. The course"
of . -'money rates 'has been /.upward
throughout the-, world's money centers
and some further large credit require
ments-are to be 'met/ by' : : the ' New. York
money-market \u25a0 in the immediate future.
The future ~ot the money market; is,
therefore, by no means clear. 'The ad
monition-to-caution in the use of
credits on' stock market speculation
was :of a 'force that had to be heeded
and was with the rise in
money rates to the highest level of the
season. The advance of a full one per
cent in the Bank of. England official
discount rate to 4 per cent was a proc
lamation of 'the shrinkage of banking
resources and of the necessity for re
trenchment, c That rate has not. been
touched _ by " the Bank of England for
over -two years, and has only been ex
ceeded a few times ; in many, years past
in/times of special stress.
A policy of recuperation is thus clear
ly foreshadowed, which had its imme
diate effect, on the Continental ex
changes in London. The problem of
New York's ability to draw \u25a0; further
gold' from Europe for its own relief
is .thus made immediately prominent.
Parcels of .gold engaged last week in
London have arrived from time to time
and have gone into New York bank re
serves,- and an additional $1,800,000 was
secured early In the week to arrive
next week. " : ,
The . forthcoming Russian loan has
come up for renewed concern and re
ports have got abroad stating the in
tended loan of $175,000,00 ' is to
be apportioned to Paris and Berlin. It
is the general expectation that there
will be a New York participation in the
subscriptions also. '.< ,
THE COTTON MARKET.
v Foreign exchange rates in New York
went higher under the influence of hard
ening foreign money markets. Some of
the exchange was attributed to a demand
from short -Interests to cover sales made
to cover earlier -borrowing made abroad.
There has been complaint of a scarcity
of grain and cotton bills, foreign demand
for cotton -having been \ curtailed by the
speculative level to which the price of
that commodity had been lifted. ) The
break in the cotton market after the mid
dle of the week brought some revival of
foreign, buying and ,the foreign exchange
rate was , affected by that and the rise
in our .money rate.
The sub-treasury is taking very large
sums from the New York money market,
principally, in .the of customs pay
ments,â which the ' large - importation of
merchandise niake unusually heavy. The
resumption of Government refunding op
erations announced on Wednesday is cal
culated to: offer only a slight relief to the
drain lof revenue payments. - Heavy cur
rency.'shipments \u25a0 from Chicago to the
agricultural : sections have been resumed
and. the drain of the New York exchange
rate at Chicago gives warning of. a'Cor
responding demand |on New j York from
that -point.'; , /
\u25a0 Next week the payment of New York
taxes will call for many millions of dol
lars, and previous experience shows that
this is not without effect on the money
market Beyond the Japanese loan sub
scription on October. 16, which it is esti
mated - will j call . for some . $30,000,000, the
conviction has grown up that nothing
like; an early return of ease in the money
market \i is ; to 'be ; looked for, and specu
latops I dread the possibilities of flurries
in* the "call money market such as almost
invariably bring a spilling out of stocks
in hasty liquidation. .' ;
The cohsiderati on of the money outlook
has been to the Y practical exclusion of
allothers in .the stock market. \u25a0 The un
deviating character of 1 reports of busi
ness,;.lndustrial and agricultural, pros
perity, however, has been an underlying
Influence, and has ; constituted a -passive
power;of resistance to the depressing in
fluence of the growing , constriction- of

\u25a0 Do you. need sound advice, relief from a

cess?
Are you in doubt about an investment?
"Have you domestic trouble?
, ; â¢ Are you about to take a journey?
Have you enemies you do not knew?
Have you , friends whom you doubt?
It is not necessary he should acquaint yon
with " large and misleading advertisements.
His work Is In the open light, true and new
thought.
. That you may have happiness let Prof,
j Livingstone analyze your troubles and suggest
- the remedr. -From him. you will hear the
truth, be it good or bad: and. further, he
positively refuses to â¢ accept one Denny If
same is not perfectly satisfactory, the same
being left to your judgment whether he has
done all be ' claims and advertises to do.
His only reason for calling you by your
name and what you call for is. Incidentally,
a chain to read by.
â¢ The most critical test that one who prac-
.tlces a profession must submit to Is the cru-
cial test of time. No business that is ever so
slightly tinged with * fakertsm or doubt can
withstand the development of time and the
interchange of ideas among these who con-
sult, investigate and pass judgment.
-PROF. LIVINGSTONE has been In San
Francisco 3 years. He has been consulted
iby thousands. The best evidence of Ilis won-
derful power Is the testimony of his large
clientele, who come from every walk of life;
secondary to . this Is the true and brilliant
work cf 3 years of restlew activity without
- the loss of a day. and without exciting the
hostility or failing to secure the admiration
of every person who has consulted him. A
man should be judged by his works, and
he Is.
- â¢ Prof. Livingstone has been tried. He has
met every expectation, every advertised
promise and his reputation is established,
and will remain in San Francisco until
every prediction made by him shall be
proven true. , "

Women as Boxer*.
; So the woman who can box, really box
like a man. not like other women who
dabble. in the manly art,. is to be a fea
ture In our homea. Or if not in our homes,
in the homes of others and so more or
less a part of our surroundings. Only
one woman has yet. they say. attained
to such proficiency in boxing ;that men
who teach the science admit she is
worthy of their gloves, but hearing, the
complimentary things that are said of her
success will set , many of her slaters to
striving for honorable , mention. And
those ; who succeed ; will - find themselves
possessed of an accomplishment - that in
various ways may be of considerable
value. . In the first place, it conduces to
good health.' and in the . second .' place it
must make a woman feel courageous in
many ' situations where her - sex is com
monly supposed to be ; scared almost to
death. "Knowing how Jio box successfully.
a woman need not fear visits from tramps
nor. "encounters with .them on " lonel
roads ; she would be able ' to control <na . '

.way that a former, generation never

Lftte mail rex>ortÂ« from New York .say:
â¢Trade in this department was fairly active
Curing the past wetlt, though 'so far as Cali
fornia varieties were concerned It was confined
almost entirely to spot goods and was on the
â¢ hand-to-mouth order. Prunes were in particu
larly cood demand and stocks arriving were
taken up almost Immediately, leaving very
i:ttle in receivers' hands. A stronger feeling
r rivalled In the spot market as a consequence
cT the Increased deniajid. but there was no
Quotable Improvement In the demand. Al
â¢.-^u&h there was reported to be some indlca
lâ¢ % a of an anxiety to get business on the part
Vtf some California shippers, tie coaat situation
en the whole Is considered to be a strong one.
According to some reports, not over 300 cars
of the 1905 crop remain unsold and but-0 per
cent of this is left In growers' hands. Peaches
â¢nd Apricot* ere srrivicg slowl- while the
'demand is increasing and absorbs all offering*
rrcrcptly at full prices. The market for both
varie-Jes on the coast is very firm, the supply
there being closely controlled by one iarg<Â»
packing Interest, according to current report.
California Ilaistns on the spot are very scarce
Â«.nd so far as can be learned there are no
stEerlngi of looee or seeded Muscatels from any
Â»â¢ urce at firm prices. The demand for lm
; nrted SuUanas continues and a very large
fcj:siness in stock to arrive has already been
a r.e. Valencia layers are in very good demand
tzti buyers are reported to be giving more at
t-ntion to Malagas. Currants arÂ« In moderate

New York Cotton ajarket.
NEW YORK, Sept. 30. â There Is little or

to squeeze, as, that remaining open Is for
account of the largest' and most influential
speculative Interests, and 6pot dealers .who
have or can -get tho necessary amount of cot
ton fulfill \u25a0 their contracts.' The immediate
future course of the | market is | now more de
pendent on the character of the Government's'
crop report to be issued October 3. The bears
are placing a. good deal of reliance on. a
bearish ginners* report, which is : expected to
chow a eensationally larger amount of cotton
ginned to September 25 and also a condition
report of ' about tÂ»9.
\u25a0 Liverpool reports Fpot sales of 6000 bales,
the largest for any Saturday in weeks. \u25a0
The Commercial says : "Selling orders were
cabled Liverpool last night to influence that
market this morning.' . It bo seems that tho
bears Intend to continue, their raid to-day." , It
is generally expected thattthe Census -Bureau
report will show a sensationally large amount
of cotton ginned;'for In most parts of the belt
the pickings have been unusually early and a
larger part of the entire crop haÃ already been
picked than ever known before at this eeason."

TO BLAME YELL
Warden of Folsprii Prison
â¢ Observed All Precautions
in the Littleton Case
RESULT OF THE AUTOPSY
Postmortem Indicates That
Squeezing of the Jacket
."Hastened Convict's Death
{â¢i-eci&l Dispatch to The CalL
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 3Q.â The story of
the death of Convict Benjamin Littleton
following soon after his confinement In a
atraJtjacket at Folsom. as was pub
lished exclusively in The Call to-day,
gave the people of the State their first
' fntimation that this revolUng form of
Sumishment is still meted out in the Cali
fornia penitentiary. It was everywhere
believed that after the revelations by the
legislature two years ago of the ter
rors of the straltjacket the public ab
â¢ liorrer.ee which was awakened would
" lead to '.he abandonment of that most
â¢terrible of all prison tortures. A measure
was introduced in the Legislature pro
. hrt>iting the infliction of such punishment,
but it was defeated on the representation
by prison offlcials that the penitentiary
' ccnTd not be ruled by sentimentalists.
Even the spectacle of poor ex-convict
Shaughnessy. his arms and hands partly
paralyzed and misshapened by the em
brace of the dreaded jacket, failed to se
cure the past-age of the humane law.
But, while the Legislature did not act in
the public to believe the straitjackct had
sent such a thrill of horror through the
State that the prison directors resolved
that thereafter the infliction of the pun
ishment should be less drastic and at
tended with every possible safeguard
against maiming the victims. It was pro
vided that the warden would personally
order and If possible oversee the punish
ment, and that the prison physician
should be present to call a halt if the
torture were carried too far. Perhaps it
was these precautions, or perhaps it was
policy of greater official secrecy that led
the public to believe the straltjacket had
been discarded at the State prisons.
It remained for The Call to-day to show
the strait jacket still abides at the peni
' tontiary and that It retains its power to
injure and perhaps kill.
. Thare' is no disposition here to blame
|\Vurden Yell for the death of Convict
.Littleton. The straitjacket was on
established institution at Folsom Prison
*wh.en Archibald Yell became warden. It
1 appears he did not order Littleton laced
\u25a0 in it until he had failed by every other
"means to make the surly prisoner obey
orders. It also appears that the warden
observed all the precautions prescribed
â¢by the prison directors. The fact remains
nevertheless that Littleton 'went into
the straitjacket, so far as the physi
â¢ cian could tell, In perfect health; that he
''fainted in the jacket after twelve or four
â¢teen minutes' confinement; that he had
to be brought to the hospital, where he
remained under treatment for five or six
â¢jdays until he died. He was known to
. have kidney trouble, and yet the autopsy
performed by the prison physician
'showed that the death resulted from a
form of poisoning due to the failure of
th*> kidneys to perform their function, a
condition, which on the face of It, would
eeem to be traceable to the squeezing of
that portion of his Body in the jacket.
Warden Yell maintains, however, that
"the punishment inflicted was not severe
enough or of long enough duration to
bring about this result. It Is thought
probable here that The Call's story of
the circumstances of Littleton's death
will lead to reform in the prevailing
method of prison punishment, since it
has squarely presented to the manage
- rr.ent of the penitentiary the dangers
consequent upon the use cf the inhuman
â¢ Ett-altjaeket contrivance.
It is said that the suffering of the vic
-tyns is always great and that it brings
on a condition resembling paralysis.
PLAN TO BEAUTIFY
PARK AT ALUM ROCK
Citizens of the Garden City
. . Are in Favor of a Bond
W^'M Issue.
I EpedaJ Diwatch to ThÂ« CalL
SAN JOSE, Sept. SO.â The beautifying
and modernizing of the appointments of
Alum Rock Park by the expenditure of
$100,"000 is meeting the approbation of the
citizens of San Jose. Ever since Com
missioner Harry J. Edwards of the Park
Commission advanced the proposition it
has spread, until every organization In
tJie city has indorsed it. By a unanimous
vote of a meeting of representative citi
zens and business men the Council has
been asked to call a special election to
eubmit the question of issuing $100,000
worth of bonds.
Chairman Edwards of the general com
siittee in charge of the campaign has ap
pointed the committees to handle the mat
ter, and the campaign has now been In
augurated. .-;',.
Of the $100,000, half of the amount will
be used in building a bathhouse. This
will be constructed of stone secured in
the park and will be the finest bathhouse
on the Pacific Coast. There will be all
.kinds of mineral baths and also an elab
orate resting room and sun bath. Stone
.bridges are also to be built about >the
park, and new walks laid out. A land
scape gardener of reputation will be se
cured to lay out the grounds. The park
ls situated in a canyon, and as a natural
park has gained more than a coast repu
tation for its beauty.
The income from the park Jji the way
of payment for baths at the present time
ls more than sufficient to pay the irt
terest on the bonds, and with these im
provements the Income will be sufficient
to Drovide a sinking fund that In a few
years will take up the entire bond issue.
