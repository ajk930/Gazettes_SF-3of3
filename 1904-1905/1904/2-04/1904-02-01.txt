Consul -Skinner, Bick From Ethiopia;
Reports Hearty Reception by Its
Picturesque Sovereign.
MARSEILLES. France, Jan. h.â The
following details of the governmental
mission to King Menelik of Abyssinia,
which was led by United States Consul
Or-neral Herbert P. Skinner, have been
obtained. Hkinner's rarty arrived here
yesterday on board the steamship Vic
toria. The American marines and blue
jackets who accompanied the expedi
tion were left at Aden and went on to
join the American gunboat Machias.
Consul Skinner and the other mem
bers of the party are in good health
and they speak enthusiastically of the
reception accorded them by King Hene
lik. On the way to the c<rast the party
saw one elephant and heard a number
of lions, but experienced no exciting ad
venture. In the course of an interview
Ekinner said:
"President Roosevelt selected a most
opportune time for establishing rela
tions with Ethiopia, as Americans here
tofore have been too indifferent to the
remarkable development which is now
going on in Abyssinia. Our cotton
goods pass through many hands before
bHng sold at high prices in AbyEsinia,
but now Americans have an opportun
ity to conduct their own trade. King
Menolik will pend some of the products
at his country to the St. Louis exposi
tion, as wf>li as a commission composed
of able men to sljow the American com-
TriTcial opportunities in Abyssinia. The
King is a broad-minded statesman, who
will welcome Americans."
MENELIK VISITS MARINES.
During the visit of the Skinner party
at the capital. King Menelik received
them, surrounded bv an imposing as
semblage of 2009 functionaries. The es
cort vi American marines established a
camp called "Camp Roosevelt," which
attracted a great deal of interest.
The King made a personal inspection
of the camp which lasted three hours,
and after having witnessed the ma
neuvers of the marines, he asked one
of the men for his rifle and loaded and
fired it. This act on the part of the
King pleased the visitors greatly.
The Americans were impressed with
the assimilative ability of the Abys
sinians. Cousu! Skinner saying that th 1 *
country is b*>lng rapidly modernized,
and thnt roads, bridges, water sup
plies, telephones and telegraph lines
are being constructed. He considers
the Abyssinlans the "Japanese" of
Africa. He points out. however, that
the postal and banking systems are de
fective and unsatisfactory. The money
is on stiver basi?.
Consul Skinner b?lieves that Ameri
cans will find ;Â«. large field for activity
in Hie E"!d. cos I. petroleum and asphalt
risibilities of Abyssinia. An official
reptm of th" result of the mission has
bee:i forwarded to Washington.
FRIENDLY TOWARD FRANCE.
llg, the adviser of King
Menelik. will return to Abyssinia to
morrow. In an interview hÂ« said
AbyfiEinij. would continue to do her ut
most to favor French interests, but
that t-Jie was having a serious struggle
against foreign influences.' He said that
King Menelik intended to prove his
good feeling for France by visiting that
country during the present year.
HOME. Jan. 21â According to news
received by the Foreign Office here.
King Menelik is not likely to leave
Abyssinia, because or the political Bit
ration there. There is already a candi
date for succession to the throne and
he rears that his departure would be
a signal for civil warfare among the
different chiefs. Therefore. It is con
sidered imp'-Esible for the King to visit
the St. Louis exposition.

COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE BRITISH ARMY, WHO IS TO BE DE
POSED. AND MEMBERS- OF ROYAL â¢ COMMISSION WHICH AD
VISED SWEEPING REORGANIZATION.
Sweeping Changes to Result From
Creation of General Staff.
LOXDOX, Jan. 31.â The report of the
Royal Commission,. known as the Lord
Eshcr Commission, which was ap
pointrd last November for the purpose
of advising the Government concerning
the vreation of a board for the admin
istrative business of the War Office,
has been issued and it confirms the
change foreshadowed by the press on
November 2S, namely, that the post of
commander in chief of the army .will
be abolished.
With the approval of the King and
acting upon the recommendations 'of
the commission, the Government has
decided to appoint an army, council
framed upon the admiralty model ; to
abolish the office of commander in
chief of the army, and to create a new
post, that of inspector general, whose
principal duty .will be. to inspect and
report upon the efficiency of the mili
tary forces. ' â¢ .
The report is divided Into three sec
tions, the first of ' which relates to the
defense committee, the second to the
army council, and the .third to inspec
tion. It points out the necessity of
greater permanence in thj defense
committee, in order to*ihsure'a"contin
uous policy, and it suggests the addi
tion to the existing defense committee
of a permanent secretary, holding, of
fice five years; two naval officials se
lected by the admiralty, two military
officials chosen by the Viceroy j of In
dia, and, if possible. Mother' colonial
representatives holding office' two
years.
With regard, to the War Office, the
commission suggests that the Secre
tary of State for War be placed in the
same position as. the First Lord of. the
Admiralty, directly responsible . to the
crown and to Parliament.
The constitution of the Army Coun
cil aims at decentralization, the indi
vidual members of the council' being
entrusted with different branches, such
as armament, supply, finance, etc. In
this connection the report remarks
significantly: '..Â»,,. - j .
"â¢"New measures demand new men;
w* therefore attach special Importance
to the appointment of milltar" mem
bers not too closely connected with ex
isting methods, and who, therefore, are
not- likely to be embarrassed by the
traditions of a system which is to be
radically changed.".
The commission considers the aboli
tion of the post of commander in chief
to be imperative and It urges '; the di
vorce of the administrative I from the
executive department.
The Inspector general . is - to be ap
pointed for five years. His sole func
tion; aided by a staff, is to report upon
actual facts without expressing opin
ions on wlicies. .
The Lord Esher, Commission re
ported with: unusual- promptitude.; Sir
George Sydenham Clarke, Governor of
Victoria, one of the members of the
commission, arrived . in â¢ England : on
SAN FRANCISCO,: MONDAY; FEBRUARY . 1, 1904.
December 30, while tl\e report Is dated
January 18. .
" It is understood that all the neces
sary changes will.be carried out with
the least possible delay after obtain
ing the formal 'consent of Parliament
where jt is necessary.
The report is practical and business
like. It says it is "necessary, to make
a complete breach with the past and
endeavor to reconstitute the" War Of
fice with an eye single to the effective
training and preparation of the. mili
tary forces for war," and again it says:
"The object should be to secure for
the : British empire with the least pos
sible, derangement, of the. existing ma
chinery the immediate advantages
which a general staff conferred upon
Germany."
Contrasting the efficiency of the Ad
miraltyâwith the inefficiency of the
War 'Office,'' the report complains that
the latter "has no thinking depart
ment." .
,. .LONDON... Feb; 1. â The morning
papers. editorially applaud the report
of .the. Lord Esher Commission as
thorough and practical and express
the hope that the Government will ex
ecute the reforms with courage and
promptitude.. .,-.

Conditions Agreed To
by Mrs. Florence
MayMck.
She Is Not to Appear Upon
tbe Public Stage or
Write a Book.
Great Secrecy Attaches to Woman's
Release From Prison and Her
, Subsequent Movements."
' LONDON, Feb. 1 â The Daily M*ail
this morning says that Mrs. Florence
Maybrick is now in Liverpool and that
the following conditions attach to her
release from prison: That she shall
not appear on the public stage or write
a book of her experiences and shall In
no way endeavor to attract public at
tention to- herself.
With much mystery are the officials
shrouding their actions in connection
with the release of Mrs. Maybrick. At
the United States embassy it was em
phatically declared that she had not
been pardoned. The Home Office and
the governor of Aylesbury Prison re
fuse to make any statement. If the
ordinary course had been followed, Mrs.
Maybrick would have been taken to
Holloway,' if ,her immediate release
were' contemplated. She , probably has
been Removed to a place of less rigorous
discipline, where she can recuperate
prior to her final release.
-The details given in this morning's
Lloyds Weekly newspaper regarding
the vist of Mrs. Maybrlck's mother,
Baroness de Rouques, to Aylesbury
prison on- January 25 appear to be cor
rect. 1 She afterward described Mrs.
Maybrick as very busy with her work,
Txi- much* better' spirits 1 arid 'looking, for
ward : to '-her release. ' '
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31;âRegard
ing the case of , Mrs. Maybrick, inter
est in which has be'en- revived by re
ports that she has been released from
prison in England, State Department
officials say there has been -no recent
communication between them and the
English Government in the matter.
The last information the department
had regarding the case (and this is now
some months old) was that Mrs. May
brick probably would be released late
in the coming- summer.
RUSSIA GAJNS MORE TIME.
Further Delay in Framing and For
warding; Note to Japan.
"PARIS, Jan. 31.â Another delay has
occurred in framing and forwarding
the Russian answer to the latest Jap
anese note, and this will result in fur
ther averting the culmination . of the
crisis until the middle or the latter
part of the week.
The official adyices received here
from St. Petersburg to-day, although
somevhat . negative, gave definite de
tails of the status of the note and the
programme- it was intended to follow.
Count Lamsdorff, the Russian Foreign
Minister, had expected that the ex
changes going on would have permit
ted tlie final drafting of the answer ro
that it could have- been presented to
the Czr â¢ yesterday for his approval,
but the expectation was xibt realized,
and, as a matter of fact, the answer
has not* yet .been finally drafted. It
was determined, therefore, to defer its
submission to the Czar until next
Tuesday or Wednesday. . Efforts are
still being made to so shape this an
swer as , to prevent a rupture.
This new delay is interpreted as
slightly improving the situation, as it
indicates that Russia is making ex
treme efforts to brtng the answer with
in limits acceptable to, Japan.
Owing to the fact that the Russian
answer is not completed, it is pointed
out that the reports concerning its gen
eral terms must be taken, with allow
ance, as the delay indicates that some
of ,the points which presented the most
serious difficulties may yet be recon
ciled.
Throughout the past week the au
thorities here have been kept fully ad
vised of the general tendencies of Rus
sia, but they have not known whether
or not these tendencies would be in
corporated in the answer j by which
Russia- would Irrevicably abide.
* It is understood that the Empress of
Russia .has an affection of the ear
which - may necessitate an ; operation.
This fact is considered as, having some
bearing' upon the â¢ time when the . an
swer will be submitted to the Czar for
approval.
In any event officials here are confi
dent that definite results will be
known next Thursday. ., â¢
Ov.ing to the feeling that a final ef
fort- toward/reconciliation was beinp
made, the tone of official, sentiment
was somewhat improved to-day.

HAS NO INFORMATION.
Baron Hayashi, the Japanese Minis
ter to Great Britain, informed the press
last night that his Government did not
know what Russia's answer would be
and it was therefore impossible to say
whether war was probable or. not. The
fact that the Russian reply had not yet
been dispatched showed, according to
Baron Hayashi, that Russia's decision
had not yet been taken, as it was
hardly probable, if a decision had been
reached, that the note should be de
layed. /
A semi-official denial has been issued
at St. Petersburg to the reports that
the Czar presided at a council at which
the Russian reply was decided upon,
and it is explained that no conference
except that at which Grand Duke
Alexis presided has been held in con

THIRTY MEN
PERISH ON
A DESERT
Appalling Discovery
in Arid Land of
Nevada.
Tramps and Laborers Are
the Victims oi Hunger
and Tbirst.
Surveyors Find the Remains of Those
Who Made a Foolhardy Effort to
Cross a Waste Area.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS VEGAS, New, Jan. 31.â Thirty
bodies of men who perished on the
Nevada desert from thirst and hun
ger have been found by a party of sur
veyors who are in advance of the San
Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Rail
road.
The victims of the desert met death
within the last few weeks according to
all the evidence obtainable and from
the condition of the remains when dis
covered. The men perished in attempt
ing to cross the waste area that
stretches a distance, of eighty miles
from Los Vegas to the California line.
Word that has just been brought in
from the advance party of surveyors
tells of many grewsome findings, in
cluding the remains of four, five or half
a dozen men lying in close proximity.
The hardy and seasoned men who are
laying out the railroad route are sick,
with the horror of their discoveries. In
most instances the bodies have been
partially eatep by coyotes and buz
zards to such an extent as to be beyond
recognition. The majority of the vic
tims were tramps and railroad laborers,
who have attempted to cross from the
railroad. camps in Nevada to the more
agreeable climate of California.
INSANITY
BEFORE I>EATII.
The thirty bodies just reported werÂ«
all. found within a radius of a quarter
of a mile around "Dead Man's Well."
the only water in the entire desert, and
that a delusion which lures men to in
sanity and death. Several of the bodies
were absolutely nude, showing that the
crazed men had cast off their clothing
before dropping down to die on the
sagebrush plains.
One hundred feet from this well the
surveying party came across six bodies
lying a few yards apart. They had been
frightfully torn and half-eaten by the
desert beasts and birds of prey.
This Dead Man's Well is about half
way across the barren territory that
divides the little settlements of South
ern Nevada from the hills of Califor
nia. It was sunk many years ago to
provide water for the people who at
tempted to cross the desert on foot in
spite of warnings. The water, which
was struck at a depth of 125 feet,
proved to be brackish, salt and utterly
unfit for human consumption. To
drink of this water means madness.
Hundreds have probably drank of it
only to so raving mad and wander
aimlessly about until the heat,
added to . other suffering, brought
death as a relief to their terrible suf
fering. The men who have tried this
tramp across the desert lately were
laborers, formerly employed on the
Clark road, who desired to get to Cali
fornia, and tramps who mistakenly
took this route.
PERIIi IX THE WATER.
A short time ago a laborer started
across with a bottle of water; one
week later his body was found within
200 yards of the Moapa River. lie had
evidently became insane from thirst
and perished within a stone's throw
of the fresh water river, which he was
unable to see on account of the dark
ness. Two days prior to this incident
two tramps were picked up near
"Dead Man's Well" by a stage driver.
Both men were violently Insane and
were wandering around in a nude con
dition. They attempted to resist res
cue, but were too weak. They died,
before the stage reached Moapa.
A few days ago a railroad laborer
was found by a party of prospectors
in the middle of the desert. He. too.
had stripped off all his clothing and
became crazed. He Imagined he could
hear water trinkllng and groped blind
ly, about searching for It. He was
taken to Los Vegas, where he is
slowly recovering his senses. Many
instances of this sort have been re
ported, but no one believed that such
a large number had perished recently
as Is now proved by the ghastly finds
of the surveyor's party.
Prayers Are Offered for Rain.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 31.â Special
prayers were offered to-day In all the
Catholic and many of the Protestant
churches of the city for rain. In some
of the churches special rain services
were held. The feelfng seems to be
general among the ministers and the
members of the churches that rain
will be sent to break the drought If
the people pray fervently for it. Fol
lowing the scriptural quotation that
"the prayer of the righteous man
availeth much," the invocations were
pronounced. About six weeks ajjo
Bishop Conaty issued a circular ask
ing the pastors of the Catholic
churches to pray for rain at their ser
vices.

the long-drawn-out asphalt case. The
court gives as its unanimous judgment
the opinion that the claim of Warner

Besslon of the Felicidad Asphalt mine,
â  portion of the, asphalt lake in the
State of Bermuda, claimed also by the
New York and Bermudez Asphalt
Company, which holds a concession to
work the lake, is null and void.
â The Felicidad mine was bought in

The court bases its opinion on the
argument that, while the concession of
the Bermudez company was valid, no
claim to the Felicidad could be grant
ed. The debates revealed the fact
that Warner & Quinlan had bought
the Felicidad mine without receiving

Support for Catholic Institu

DETROIT. Jan. 31.â About 2000 per
sons were present in Light Guard Ar
mory to-day at a mass meeting that
marked the close of the semi-annual
meetmg of the advisosy board and. ex
ecutive board of the American^Federa
tion of Catholic Societies. Speaking of
the aims of the federation. Bishop Mc-
Faul of Trenton. N. J., said it would
accomplish much in the direction of
doing away %vilh two great deficiencies
of the Catholic church. One of these,
he said, was the lack of organized
Catholic opinion, the othei being the
lack of an organ to disseminate such
an opinion if it existed.
- "Retain the present public school
system." said Bishop McFaul. "but do
not bar Catholics out of their rights as
citizens. The federation has taken an
admirable stand on this question. Its
platform is: That there shall be no
public moneys paid out for religious
instruction in any school. But let the
State examine our schools and if on
examination it is found that we are
giving the children an education which
comes up to the requirements of the
State then let the State pay for it."
The beard decided that a special or
ganization fund of $5000 should be
raised.

"I might have done the mile in thirty

said Vanderbilt as he left in his special

The actual speed at which. Vanderbilt
might have traveled yesterday is; of
course, a matter of conjecturf . He did
travel in thirty-nine seconds,* vrhlch is
sufficient unto the day, for It Is the

aged forty-one seconds for ten miles,
which is looked upon as quite as .re

A NEW SUBSTITUTE
FOR WHALEBONE
The increasing scarcity of whale
bone has attracted the attention of
merchants, and inventors all' the world
over to the discovery of substitutes
for use in corset and dress making-, but
so far few satisfactory ones have been
discovered. ,';- .- ; .â¢;;â 
Steel is in many respects the best
substitute and in some it is superior
to whalebone. Its fatal defects are its
tendency to rust and its sharp edges,
which cut the fabric of the corset.
While It has almost exclusively re
placed whalebone in the cheaper grade
of corsets, these two defects have shut
it out entirely from use by the high
grade commercial and custom corset
makers. Horn strips and other sub
stitutes lack- the resiliency and light
ness of whalebone^
There Is a substitute now on ,the
market which' seems to fill about all
the requirements. It Is" composed of
thin strips - of steel of the highest
grade, covered with a composition
which absolutely protects it from rust,
and which at the same time, having
rounded edges, protects the fabric of
the corset or dress from being cut by
the sharp edges of the steel. Unlike
whalebone, it .is practically indestruc
tible, possessing greater resiliency, and
is much thinner than whalebone of
equal strength, which, is a strong point
in its favor. The chief drawback to
its use is that It cannot be cut to the
lengths required, but the manufacturer
declares that it , is made in so 'I many
lengths" that it is unnecessary to cut
it â New York Press,

KINGMAN, A. T., Jan. 31.â One of
the most sanguinary life and death
struggles in the history of this coun
ty took place last evening at a place
known as Meyers Well, . twenty-six
miles west of here, between Thomas
"W.'Smith and two men known as Lang
and Wilbur, in which Wilbur was fatal
ly and Lang seriously wounded. Wil
bur died to-day.
The three men had entered into a
prospecting agreement and Smith came
to town for a supply of provisions.
After depositing supplies at the Lang
and Wilbur camp, the men went to
Smith's camp to assist in bringing his
outfit to the new camp. On the way
they apparently drank liquor freely
and were sVion involved in a quarrel.
Wilbur and Lang attacked Smith and
a rough and tumble fight followed.
From 6 o'clock yesterday morning until
7 o'clock last night the men fought with
hands and rocks with but slight inter
mission, and the ground over which
the battle raged is covered with blood.
Smith was badly battered, but the
other two men were so overcome that
they were unable to continue the flght
and early this morning Wilbur died
from his injuries. A teamster wit
nessed the flght. but made no effort to
separate the combatants.
Smith came to Kinsman this after
noon and gave himself up to the
Sheriff and is now in the County Jail.

RADIO-ACTIVE

Special Dispatch to The Call
NEW HAVEN, Jan. 31â Professor
Henry Andrews Biimstead of the phy
sical department of Sheffield Scientific
School, who, with an assistant. Pro
fessor L. P. Wheeler, has been experi
menting for several months with ra
dium found in surface water and earth
around this city, has just completed
his work and the American Journal of
Science to-morrow will give a detailed
account of the results obtained. Pro
fessor Bumstead has had such ereat
success . in his investigations that a
leave of . absence for the coming: year
has been granted him by the Yale cor
poration in order th^t he ' may con
tinue his investigations abroad.
Professor Bumstead draws three
conclusions of the greatest interest to
Investigators. In regard to the pres
ence of radio-active gas in the earth
and: in surface water near this city.
Professor Bumstead says:
"First â Radio-active gas found in the
ground and in surface water near New
Haven is. apparently identical with the
emanation from radium.
"Secondâ The density of the radium
emanation, as determined by its rate
of diffusion, is about four times that of
carbon dioxide, which gives it a molec
ular weight of 180. . â¢
"Thirdâ We are unable to obtain
radio-active gas from mercury, recent
ly described by Strutt, and are there
fore inclined to attribute his results
to an impurity in the mercury used."
FINAL REST FOR BODY
OF JAMES SMITIISON
Forced Removal From Genoa Ceme-
tery Brings It Back to Land of
Adontion. ,
In charge of Professor Alexander
Graham Bell, the body of James
Smithson founder of the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, D. C. Is
on its way to New York from Gibral
tar. . /â ":,â /
James Smithson was the natural
son of Hugh, first Duke of Northum
berland, and Elizabeth, nieceof -the
Duke of Somerset, a lineal descendant
of Henry VII. He became a .wander
er, visited this country, and when he
died at Genoa, Italy, in 1829, he lefr
his entire fortune, amounting io
$500,000, to the Government of the
United States "to found at Washing
ton, under the name of the Smith
sonian institution^ an establishment
for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men." .
It had been Sm'ithson's boast that
his name would remain known among
men when the titles of the Northum
berland and Percys, who were his an
cestors, were' extinct and forgotten.
Smithson's legacy to the United States
was brought to this^country by Rich
ard ; Rush sixty-five years. .ago. The
money was brought in' 105 bVgs, each
.containing 1000 gold? sovereigns. As
a result, of the investment of that
fund there has grown up in Washing
ton an institution which,:' in addition
to the income of $50,000 from Smith
son's legacy, expends each year $450,^
000.
It. came to the: attention of Profes
sor Alexander Graham Bell about /a
year ago that Smithson's body was
about to be disturbed.^ The cemetery
in Genoa where it was buried was to
give way to a marble 'quarry/and; the
Idea of bringing, his body to America
was set forth. ".^ The matter .was; thug
brought tc the attention of â¢ the re
gents . of the ; Smithsonian Institution.
As a" result ,of; the action taken : by
the board of resents, . Professor Bell
sailed for Europe about a J month ago.
He superintended' the .disinterring of
Smithson's body.

BENEFICIAL INSECTS
FROM OTHER' LANDS
Are Imported Into This â County to
Destroy Others Killing Our
Fruit Trees.
The American public naturally looks
with suspicion upon the importation of
foreign living products. The English
sparrow, first brought here about thirty
years ago, has driven away nearly all
our native song birds, while thÂ« Ger
man cam has driven from our streams
most of the fine food fishes with which
they once abounded.
It is noAv proposed to import a cer
tain breed of insect which, it is claimed,
will rid the orchards of diseases that
are imperiling the bearing' capacity of
the trees.' Th^s^nsect, though called
the Chinese ladr-btrd, ' Is iiothing but
an insect.' It is said to.be the, nktural
enemy of the dreaded San Jose scale.
Its discovery in. -its native habitat neat
the great wall of China was one ef the
most .valuable' finds credited to the
Agricultural Department. It is mul
tiplying at a very satisfactory rate.
Colonies were sent 'out to six States
during the last' year with encouraging
success... A colony liberated in a Geor
gia peach orchard' of 17,000 trees now
numbers 30,000 or 40,000 insects, ; and
with the additional broods expected be
fore the end of ".". the season, ( wMl be
numerically strong enough to praptical
ly exterminate the scale. Ab this or
chard adjoins another" of 250,000 trees
similarly infested, â¢ the spread of the
beetle will be anxiously awaited. ;.
Equally promising are the reports of
the results of the 'importation from
Italy and Africa of an Insect enemy of
the black scale which 'threatened the
destruction of California's famous or
chards. The insect Is now established
in every country south of Point Con
ception, and yet the. Commissioner of
Horticulture at San Francisco, who has
been distributing the colonies, cannot
keep pace with the demand. The Los
Angeles Commissioners ' distributed
over 400 strong colonfes at Escondido.
At Pasadena the insects, according 1 to
the Commissioner of Agriculture, have
spread naturally, and, what Is vitally
important, have destroyed "over 90 per
cent of the black scale."
The other important insect importa
tion made by the division, namely, the
inseot that is essential for the fertiliza
tion of figs and the production of the
numerous v seeds so characteristic of the
Mediterranean fruit, has become thor
oughly acclimatized at Fresno and at
Niles, Cal. The fig crop raised at the
former place last year was large and
of very superior quality. Now that the
secret of fig growing has been traced
to the agency of an insect and the lat
ter, has become thoroughly established

HOW ROYAL CHRISTMAS'
GIFTS ARE SELECTED
King Edward Inclines to 'Canes or
Tobacco Boxes, Alexandra to
Jeweled Trinkets.
. The -festive season is kept in royal
fashion at SandringhamAand all' the
old English traditions are scrupulously
adhered to. with perhaps a touch of â¢
the German sentimental feeling, which ;
makes the Christmas tree as much a 'â 
part of the festival 'as plum pudding >
and roast beef are here. :
The ceremony of receiving the Christ- â 
mas presents at Sandrlngham is a most i
elaborate one. All the gifts, with la- "
bels and' inscriptions,' are" lard out on i
tables in one of the sitting rooms, and j
the gifts of each person generally oc- i
cupy a whole table. - I
The King is a great present giver
and really enjoys choosing gifts for his
friends, nor does he shirk -the personal
trouble of making each one appropriate
to its recipient. Jewelry is his- most
frequent choice, but he also gives snuff
boxes, cigar boxes and walking, sticks. :
His Majesty sends few Christmas cards,
as he prefers writing little notes of
greeting, which are' naturally most,
highly valued. . '; : "':Vr â¢'.'"* ;
â¢ The Queen â  has a certain. . num- ;
ber of "private" Christmas cards print- :
ed for her friends, but her Majesty, like
the King, sends notes and little gifts (
to her personal friends In preference to
the more hackneyed and less compli- ;
mentary form of greeting. Last Christ- j
mas she -sent a great many jeweled
brooches and trinkets, while some spe
cially favored individuals â¢ received j
photographs taken by the Queen, most
daintily mounted and with ; the ropal j
monogram ("A" surmounted by r a .
crown) on the frame. â¢
Neither the Queen nor the Princess of j
Wales often go to the shops, but order
selections of all the 'novelties to be sent
them! Princess Louise (Duchess of Ar-1
gyll), 'the Duchess of Connaught and j
the daughters of the King go to the.
shops themselves and make their unob- j
trusive purchases with other people. j
: The late Queen gave much more "use- i
ful" presents than is the fashion with I
the royal 'family to-day, often sending
dress lengths of tartan, velvet, plaids
and sometimes. Cairngorms and other
Scotch jewelry. Queen Victoria herself
probably received more gifts'during her
life/than any other living person, and
the actual"; value must have amounted
to; quite a million pounds sterling.
Apropos of royal presents it is inter
esting to know that whatever other
gifts the King and Queen give their
daughters each year as their birthday
anniversaries come round : the Prin
cesses receive an exquisite pearl, as
perfect, in shape and color as can be
obtained. This delightful custom began

Appendicitis Suddenly Ends

After Her Honeymoon Trip
SAD CLOSE OF ROMANCE
Interesting Wedding in Denver
on New Year's Day Recalled,
by Spokane Hospital Case
S=rÂ»cia! D!*rÂ»t<"h to Th e C* 11
SPOKANE. Jan. 31.â Mrs. Charles W.
Thorp, daughter of Will jam F. Cody,
died at a Spokane hospital this morn-
Ing. Her death was due to the shock
of an operation for appendicitis and
complications. Dr. and Mrs. Thorp
had been residents of Spokane only a
couple of weeks, coming Jiere after their
honeymoon trip following their wed
ding at Denver on New Year's day.
The wedding of Mrs. Arta Cody Boal
and Dr. Thorp was the culmination of
a romance of several years' standing
and was kept secret for several days
owing to the opposition of "Buffalo
Bill." who did not fancy an army sur-
Feon for a son-in-law. Though the
wedding was performed at Denver
Kew Year's day. the Denver papers did
not discover the fart until five days
later, when the couple had left for the
Northwest. Ci':~ .
Dr. Thorp first met his wife
vhen she was the wife of H.
H. Bcal, a wealthy resident of
Chicago. Boal's stepmother was
e daughter cf Dr. Ayres and on
l-,er d?ath Inherited a fortune of J4.000,
000. Abcut three years ago Boal was
thrown from a horsr. sustaining: in
juries which caused frequent fits of
melancholia. During one of these fits
he committed suicide. During the
Fpanish-American War Dr. Thorp was
f tationed in the Philippines as an army
surgron and until recently was doinif
po*t duty in the West. He resigned to
establish a practice here. ; '.â¢ -..-â â¢

MANY INJURED
IN A WRECK
Missouri Pacific Train Is De
railed in Kansas and the
Coaches Are Badlv Shattered
ONE PASSENGER IS KILLED
Engine and Rear Pullman Re
main on the Track-Accident
Caused by a Broken Rail
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. Jan. 31.â The
Colorado flyer on the Missouri Pacific
Railway that left Denver Saturday af
ternoon for Kansas City was derailed
near Miller. Kans., to-day while run
ning at the rate of forty miles an hour.
The engine and the rear car. a Pullman,
alone remained upripht on the track.
The baggage car. mail car, smoker and
a chair car were thrown into- the ditch,
turning over and were badly shattered.
One person was killed and thirteen in
jured, one seriously. The dead:
W. L. BROWN, passenger. Ransom,
Kans.
The injured: Mrs. E^. J. Shouse.
Shields, Kans., leg broken, internal in
juries, serious: E. J. Shouse, Shields,
Kans., badly bruised and cut; P. P.
Gray. Denver, slightly bruised and cut;
Frank Patrick, Topeka, bruised about
body and legs; William L. Schubert.
Sl. Louis, head hurt; Miss Ora Love

W. C. Doan. St. Louis, body bruised and
wrist sprained; Thomas A. Fulton.
Kansas City, back sprained; H. J.
Makato, Chicago, neck and back
sprained;. W. S. Sanford. Kansas City,
mail clerk, jaw broken; J. D. Hays,
White Plains, Ga., bruiied and cut;
Alex Punton, Munhall, Pa., scalp
wounds; James Lewis, Fittsburgt Pa.,
bruised.
Mr. and Mrs. Shouse and Patrick
and Sanford were brought to Kansas
City, where all except Patrick were
taken to hospitals. Patrick, whose in
juries were slight, left to-night for Chi
cago. The other injured were brought
part way to Kansas City, leaving for
their various destinations at different
points along the line between Miller
and here. â¢
The wreck* was caused by the snap
ping of a rail, due evidently to the
sever^ cold weather ot the past week.
Physicians reached thÂ« scene promptly
and a relief train was hurried from
Osawatomte, starting East with the in
jured during tte afternoon. Mrs.
Shouse, the most sc-riously hurt, was
seated with her husba:id in the front
end of the chair car when the wreck
occurred. Most of the injured were in
the smoking car, which was completely
wrecked.
Mr. and Mrs. Shouse were on their
way to Braymer, Mo., to attend the
funeral of Mrs. Shouse'n sister.
At the time of the accident the train
was two hours late and making up
time. It had no orders to stop ai
Miller and went by at full speed, being
derailed on the outskirts of the town.
The engine and tender passed over the
defective rail in safety. The front
trucks of the mail car jumped th<?
track and crashed into^a freight car
on a siding:. The' 'b'asgake car follow
ing pushed the rnail car at right an
gles across the track and both cars
served to block the smoker. The chair
car following the- r smeker partially
telescoped the smoker^and the latter
was rendered into kindling wood. The
Pullman remained on the track, and
aside from a severe shaking up the
passengers in that car were unin
jured.
SEGREGATION OF SEXES
PROMOTES KNOWLEDGE
Experiment In Chicago University
Makes Opponents for Co- â 
Education.
CHICAGO, Jan. 31.â According to a
report submitted^by Dean George E.
Vincent to President Harper of the
University of Chicago, the experiment
of segregating the sexes in the junior
college work during the past year has
been a success. Dean Vincent in his
report says:
"Unofficially various instructors who
have taught the classes exclusively for
men or women have told me that from
their experience they believe'segrega
tion is going to work out as an educa
tional and social success. One inter
esting feature of the situation is that
several of the instructors who were
radically opposed to segregation now
say that their experience leads them
to favor it heartily."
"The girls and boys do not have any
chance to look at one another and be
distracted in their classroom work,"
said Professor Chandler, who has
taught segregated Latin classes. "I
favored co-education and voted against
segregation, but I must say that as a
result of the year's impressions I am
now convinced that segregation is bet
ter. In my classes there has been bet
ter concentration and the students
have accomplished more than before
segregation."

As a business man I have seen the neces
sity for the alliance, of which I urn * mra
her. It is organized exactly oil the lines of
the labor unions. It is madeÂ»up of workers in
every !ine of industry, of business and of all
the professions. It has as much ricbt to ex
ist as the labor unions and the labor unions
have as much Hght to exist as any church.
Labor unions have elevated tIJ* caufce of labor,
and the Citizens'. Alliance, a union of citizens,
will as surely efevate* the cause of our citi
zens. Th<Â» alliance has Its membership cards â
it takes unitM action: It will be an organiza
tion of national scop* first and of International
scope after awhile. ,
The American Federation of Labor has more
than 100.000 men working on yearly sa.!arira
who do nothing else but ftalk up and down
the ler.gth and breadth of this land, organiz
ing unions and pr-paring for conflict. This
ereat labor organization is retting all Its cash
from the labor unionists who are earning
wages and meeting these cash donations or
due? by securing higher prices for labor. a'hPre
Is no man who will deny that the Citizens'
Alliance can do the same. When the alliance
Is organized from the Atlantic to the Pacific
and from the Gulf to the Lakes with citizens'
unions that represent the brains, enterprise
and money of this nation It can have 1CO.0OO
men In the field organizing, juit the game as
the labor unions do.
ASKS SO3IE QUESTIONS.
Is It not possible for the citizen's union to
resort to the methods of the labor unions to
raise funds, through the addition of a p*r
ccntage to cover the cost oi th%> work. Just as
business men figure a percentage for Insurance
against fire and other losses? Of course that
can be done.
The citizens' union Is Just as good a union
as the labor union. If the labor unions had
been always reasonable they would never have
forced the citizens to form a union of their
own. Citizens generally were. not permitted to
Join the labor unions. Being Imbued with the

pot Just as rood a. union card as they carry.
We realize that our union ha* as good a right
to be on the earth as the labor unions have.
V> are constructed on the ;em: lines exactly
and the labor unions cannot find fault with us.
for we are r.ot oppcpin? unionism.
The only way to kill thÂ«> clti*Â«ns' union Is
for the labor union? to ask us to surrender
our charter and join with them. As we go
along and add more names to our big member
ship list â  the time will come when politicians
In the Legislature and in the City Hall will
look wise when labor unions come along and
ask for unreasonable concessions in the way
of legislation, and they will think twice before
acting hastily, for it will be realized that the
citizen*' vote is as great. If not greater, than
the labor union vote. .
STRENGTH AT POLLS.
It Is not- a Rom! thing- tn have ton much
power. Very few perfonw-'and.very- few' asso
ciations* know how to u?e power to the best
advantage. Abraham L4ncoln was *a great
man and a powerful -roan, but he always ex
erclged his power in. the direction of justice.
If labor unions exercised thMr power abso
lutely for Justice, there would be no- occasion
for the citizens to get -.together and form a
union with a voting fore* that can offset them
at the ballot box.
We all labor. The man who stand* at his
! desk and wields a pen labors as hard as the
man who shovÂ»!s In the trench and. as a
rule, does not live as long. We all have our
> duties and the man who works at a latha for
eight hours and earn-j S '. a day performs his
duty like a man when he realizes that bis
employer is entitled to a fair day's work for
a fair day's pay. The world Is full of mechan
ics who recognize that an employer has no
light to enslave them with a contract, nor has
Whe mechanic any richtto enslave his em
ployer with a contract. ThÂ» mechanic realizes
that when/he gives up hls'Job it no longer be
long* to him. but to the man who is willing
to work In the place that he has vacated. This
stands for thÂ» constitutional rights of Ameri
can citizenship. Because the lar.i* unions
deny this principle citii-ns* unions are being
formed all ever the United States for the pur
pose of protecting American citizens in their
right*.
* REASONS THE MATTER.
Many Â« man can recall tho injustice of labor
unionists and realize that It la a mistake to
think of risking brains and money in a mael
strom of commercialism, with* no higher guar-Â»
antee of returns than strikes, boycott*, pick
ets and all those phases of violence thai spring
from r mistaken understanding of civilization
and all It Is striving to accomplish. LeÂ»s
than a year *go public sympathy stood with
th<? labor unions, but public sympathy to-day
Is largely against teem.
The better class of labor unionists realize
that the time is at hana when tiiey must re
sort to strenuous measures to ke^p the vlolenl
class of unionism down If they hope to regain
the confidence and good will of the people.

of 7 cents and a uniform wage for out
side employment. The battle has
scarcely begun. More or less Appre

Mission of Brother Hughes, Who
Is Raising Money to Send to
Ireland, Heartily Indorsed
At the annual convention of the
Gaelic League of the State of Califor
nia a Ions discussion took place as to
the advisability of changing the man
ner of electing delegates. It was finally
decided to allow, each branch In the
State one delegate of its own. choosing
as a representative on the State ex
ecutive committee.
Father Yorke presided at the meet
ing, which was opened with prayer In
Gaelic by Father Nugent, the league's
State chaplain. Following this the re
port of .the executive committee was
read. It showed^the league to be in a
prosperous condition financially and
recapitulated the work done during the
last year, mentioning among other
things the sending of the body of
Father; O'Growney to- Ireland for inter
ment. I
The report also criticized the apathy
of many Irishmen to L their native
tongue*. . Branches are "opened with
great- enthusiasm; but in time the at
tendance falls off and the work is all
left to a faithful few.
A resolution was adopted to the ef
fect that the league will always use its
utmost endeavors to restore to Ireland
her native tongue, but will have noth
ing to do with any movement that does
not intend ultimately to separate Eng
land from Ireland. , . '
After the adoption of the resolutions
a very pleasant diversion occurred,
when the secretary. Miss Francis X.
Barr, was, on behalf of O'Growney
branch, presented with a handsome
emblem of the order in appreciation of
her faithful services. Miss Barr in a
neat speecji thanked the members of
the league for the token. - : -s- â  .
The work of. Brother Hughes, who Is
at present in this country Vaising funds
for the erection of a novitiate of Chris
tian Brothers at Clontarf, Ireland, was
heartily approved of. Brother Hughes
is about to leave "for the north and a
copy of the resolutions was presented
him to aid him in his work.
The former officers of the league were
re-elected as follows: Rev. Peter C.
Yorke. president: T. J. Mallott. vice
president; Miss F. X. Barr. recording
secretary; D. S. McCarthy, financial
secretary; G. J. Lowe, cqrresponding

VIENNA. Jan. 31. â The efforts of
the Municipal Council to reduce the
price of meat to the people of Vienna
by securing the importation of Trans-
Atlantic meat products are meeting
very strong opposition from the Agra
rian interests. Associations of farm
ers and cattlemen and peasants*
unions throughout Austria, have ad
dressed telegrams of protest to the
Ministry of the Interior and the City
Council urging that irreparable dam
age would be done the agricultural
interests of the country if meat from
the other side of the Atlantic were
permitted. The butchers of Vienna
being oppose.! to the sale of foreign
meat, the Pork Butchers' Association
has taken up the matter and now an

gentine beef o Vienna will arrive" here
next Tuesday. It appears to be very
doubtful, however,' whether the Gov
ernment will permit this shipment to
be sold.

Ministers, Medical Men,
Thinkers and Workers En-
dorse This Marvelous
Vegetable Pepsin.
I HAVE presented my claims. I have
! told the public what I hotaestly think
of Paw Paw, I have given away more
than 12.000 bottles, here- in San Francis-
co. I have asked physicians and the
public to make a most thorough test, and
then report, at my expense, through, the
columns of the newspapers, the result of
their experience.
Now let the people who have tried this
remedy bear witness; let them tell the
truth. If It has cured them let them
say so. If It has helped them let them
say so. If it has done them no good let
them say so. I desire that the public
shall be the jury, and that truth shall sit
in judgment.
I claim it is a disgrace for a man to be
sick, ailing and complaining If he can be
cured. He owes It to himself, he owes it
to his family and he owes it to society to
set well.
If Paw Paw will cure dyspepsia and
all stomach troubles, then every sufferer
from this ailment is /morally bound to
. take It. If a person can't sleep, if a per-
son Is nervous, if he is weak and debili-
tated and he refuses' to take Paw Paw,
then he is entitled to no sympathy or
consideration. A thirsty man might as
well -refuse to drink water as for a man
to refuse to take Paw Paw who is suffer-
ing with dyspepsia and nervousness.
There is no doubt about the curative
qualities of the Paw Paw. Thousands
of people have testified that they have
been cured by it. You are bound to be-
lieve what these people say.

Mrs. C. S. Hamlin. residing at 3879
Gold street. North Oakland, was se

The flaming stuff caught Mrs. Hamlin

tensely painful injuries, though for
tunately prompt attention to them
averted danger of serious results.
The mixture had been cooking over
the gasoline flame for some time. Mrs.
Hamlin was called away for a minute,
and during her absence the stuff slop
ped over and caught fire. When the
housewife returned she paw the flames.
Without hesitating the woman rushed
to the stove, grabbed the vessel and
ran into the yard with it. She was
thinking only of the danger to the
house. But before Mrs. Hamlin could
drop the kettle the greasy compound
had scattered her.

Scbutf nml Scouting.
" Scout, "''"scouts" and "scouting" are
three words which were U3ed more
loosely, perhaps, than any others dur
ing the whole of the late disturbances
in South Africa. Regiment after regi
ment of irregulars was .raised under
the name of this, that and t'other
"Scout*." which yet from first to last
did no ftr$>ke of scouting, but remained
purely and simply the invaluable
mountwl infantry such regiments
proved to be. It followed that thou
.Â«<anfi3 of men rode about with the title
â¢'Scout" big and bold upon their hats,
who yet knew as little of real scouting
work p.s if they were straight from Al
dershot. And as to "scouting," I re
member that a daily patrol over the
same threÂ«- miles of road, starting at
ciawn every morning, was called
"scouting" by .the commandant of a
most Important depot point. My sug
gestion that I should be allowed to
take tho half of the men and push
away for four or five days Into the
Free Ptate was called "idiotic talk" by
the same commandant; but that was
the first month of the war. Long

CITY OF OPPORTUNITY.
During the morning services to-day
George N. Bierce of Dayton, Ohio, a
capitalist, who has been closely Iden
tified with the association work for
twenty-five years, delivered an address
at the First Congregational Church.
Mr. Bierce has made large financial
contributions to the association, both
for support at Dayton'and for the gen
eral movement. " This evening he spoke
at the First Methodist Church. Dur
ing his address Mr. Bierce said:
At the office of the hotel where I am stop
ping I picked up a little booklet setting forth
the advantages of your city. It said, among
other things, that there were 8000 mechanics
employed in Oakland, and at the bottom of
the page 1- found this senttnee, "The" city of
opportunity/' and that text is good enough
for me. L>et us stop and think a moment. Do
we appreciate the privilege of living In this
age of wondrous opportunity? I hardly think
that we do.
One of the great objects of the Young Men's
Christian Association Is to enable the young
man of to-day to obtain a practical working
knowledge of the word of God, to afford a
training school or drill field, where the youn* o
iran may Fwure a neeetnary knowledge of
Christianity, which evrry mÂ«n nauRt ha,ve If
he would be successful in the great work of
life. We All knew how awkward is the raw
recruit when he first appears upon th* drill
ground, especially If he belongs to the cav
alry branch of the serviceâ how awkwardly he
Bits his horse; yet. take him six month* hence,
all trace of fear hag disappeared and he Is
now the trained soldier. The Young Men's
Christian -Association took the icre<Â»n, raw,
country bey. Dwljfht i,. Moody, and made him
the greatest evangelist. â â¢ the world has. ever
Â»ccn.
But this Is not the only work of the Young
Men's Christian Association. This organisa
tion also trains young men to personally deal
with their .fellow men. and if the forces" of
evil In our cities are overcome it will be be
cause u. large number of our young men ko
forth intd the shop. - the store, the counting
room and the bank and carry on the great
work there. The Youn* Men's Christian â , As
sociation stands for the proposition that the
only trufi manhood is Christian manhood, but
it goes farther than do the churches, and la
bors to preserve the body as well as. to save
the soul, believlnc that our young men ara
the most valuable asset of the welfare of our
nation. T.iko. for Instance, the 25.000 young
men of Oakland and its neighboring cities,
which are toon, no I have been informed, to bo
consolidated Into a Greater Oakland. Almost
any young man can easily earn $000 ft year,
which Is C psr cent Interest on a capitaliza
tion of - $l0.fl<>0, which almost any business
man will agree Is a fairly good Investment.
Then the 25,000 young men of Greater Oakland
represent a capitalization of 1250.000,000. and
yet this Is by far the poorest and meanest
standard by which to judge manhood.

Dr. Albert' Shaw, editor of the Re
view of Reviews, will deliver the first
annual Barbara Weinstock lecture on
"The Morals of Trade" Thursday even
ing,in Heartst Hall. Dr. Shaw's sub
ject will be "Public Duties and Re
lations of Modern Business Life."
This lectureship was founded- bv
Henry Weinstock of Sacramento in
May, 1902, with an endowment of $5000.
Its design is stated by Mr. Weinstock
to be the correcting of the mistaken
idea in the minds of -men that monev
is the one standard of success in busi
ness 4 and that it is impossible to suc
ceed in trade without more or less of
a sacrifice of the ethical side of their
natures. Through education Mr. Wein
stock hopes to show that success is
more probable if a business is con
ducted on a high moral planeâ in de
veloping character rather than in
heaping up gold. â

of the Review of Reviews, which he
has edited for twelve years. His views
as writer of the department. "The
Progress of the World,", exhibit an ac

dom, a fairness and a patriotism -that
is remarkable.

REAL ESTATE
DEALERS BUSY
Steady Demand for Oakland
'Property in Spite of Very
Marked Increase in Prices
NEW HOTEL AT PIEDMONT
Plans Are Already Drawn for
Palatial Structure Which
Will Cost About $250,000
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Jan. 31.
During the last week the local real
estate market ha3 been unusually ac
tive for this season of the year, and at,
present there is nothing to indicate that
the demand* for residence and business
property in "Oakland will not continue
throughout othe present year. AH the
local firms report, a very active week,
and the dealers agree that if the pres
ent demand for Oakland property keeps
up, the present year will be by far the
best in the history of the city.
Plans have been drawn for a $250,000
tourist hotel to be erected at Piedmont
Springs and construction work will
soon be commenced.
Suburban real estate dealers are also
awakening to the fact that property on
the. outskirts of Oakland is Increasing
in value and they are becoming more
and more energetic in advertising prop
erty in the suburbs. The Alameda
Board of Trade has -just issued an il
lustrated pamphlet, setting forth the
advantages of that city as a location
for homes and showing views of vari
ous parks and public buildings in Ala
rceda. The booklet also contains en
gravings of a number of beautiful
homes in the "Island Citv."
Smittsinger & Matteson of Fruitvale
have also issued an advertising pam
phlet, illustrated with engravings of
homes and orchards In that location.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 31.â Since the set
tlement of the agitation over the
awarding of the two local railroad
franchises, the real estate dealers of
this city are unamimous in the opinion
that the action taken by the City Trus
tees in disposing of the transportation
privileges to the Southern Pacific
Company has resulted in infusing a
remarkable tone of confidence in the
future of the realty business here. With
an improved train and ferry service
between Alameda and San Francisco,
which the management of the Southern
Pacific Company has assured local
residents it will provide, the outlook
is encouraging. In speaking of realty
conditions, William . Hammond Jr. of
Hammond & Hammond said:
"While the- franchise agitation was
on, many property owners who con
templated building became timid and
delayed the commencement of work.
That feeling has been abolished
through the settlement of the railroad
question, and a building boom is in
sight. Many plans are being prepared,
and we expect to soon see more houses
in course of construction than has been
v.itnQssed in Alameda. for years. The
only residences now idle are old ones
that have long since passed out of date.
There are no nvodern. houses vacant,
and .when it hapens that one does be
come so, thsre^are numerous persons
waiting for the chance to take .the
place. The greatest demand is for five
and six-room cottages. These have al
ways proved good renters, and at no
time within the last year has the sup
ply met the demand."
Frank N. Dodd of the Alameda Land
Company said: "Confidence in Ala
meda's future has returned with the
settlement of the railroad franchises.
Prospective buyers who held off while
the transportation question was in the
air are beginning to resume negotia
tions, and already we have closed sev
eral good deals. The Southern Pacific
Company is feeling the effects of com
petition In Berkeley from the Key route,
and for that very "reason I believe that
the company will soon improve its
Alameda service with a view to at
tracting all the residents possible to
this city. The Southern Pacific is
practically without a competitor here,
and handles all of the commutation
travel. Therefore, the more residents
Alameda has the better it will be for
the coffers of the corporation. We can
trust to the Southern Pacific manage
ment not to overlook a good thing, and
it is my opinion that as soon as the
train and ferry service is increased,
Alameda will enjoy such a boom as
Berkeley Is now undergoing. Alameda
property is increasing in value con
stantly. The next few months will
witness the building of many homes,
seme of them elaborate and expensive
structures. The demand for homes to
rent continues and the demand for cot
tages cannot be met. Money invested
in the erection of, down-to-date six and
seven-room houses is â¢ sh well laid
out in Alameda."
The Projectiles AVe Use.
We have now armor-piercing pro
jectiles, deck-piercing projectiles, seml
armor-piercing projectiles, common
forged and cast-steel projectiles, cast
iron projectiles, shrapnel, and so on, in
endless variety. As the work the gun.
whether ashore or afloat, will have to
do can. be pretty clearly predicted, it
would appear as though one, or at most
two, kinds of projectiles were enough.
These two would naturally have, the
one a high penetrative power, and the
other a large capacity for internal
charge, giving great destructive power
when the shell is burst. No one, who
has not examined carefully the effect of
bursting a shell in a closed space can
have an idea of its destructlveness. A
small six-pounder shell, of about two
and one-quarter-inch diameter, con
taining three or four ounces of powder,
burst in an ordinary room and break-
Into twenty or thirty fragments, would
probably destroy everything in the
room.â Scientific American.

appointed by Presiden* Richards to col

SCIENTIFIC DISCOURSE
ON USING THE FEET
How Form of Dress Shows Women
to Be Ungainly in
Their Walk.
"The new instep skirt is a boon to
wontyjn. but it reveals the fact that
women are bad walkers. A surprising
number of women are pigeon-toed.
They tread on the side of the foot or
run down the heel3 of their shoes,
which gives a most ungraceful appear
ance to the feet," writes a correspond
ent in a letter to the Express.
A physical culture expert discussed
this allegation with an Express repre
sentative recently, and in the course
of conversation every count of the in
dictment was admitted.
"It is true," he said, "that women
who are otherwise pretty and graceful
exhibit in walking a remarkable
amount cf clumsiness. Watch a woman
going upstairs at a railway station. In
nine cases out of ten she will plod la
boriously up; her feet will come down
at either side of the stair and her toes
will be turned in. Half the fatigue
would be avoided if she would work the
foot from the ankle and set each foot
truly next, the other, with heels touch
ing for the instant they are together.
" In sitting also women are guilty of
a number of sins of awkwardness. The
stout woman, for example, invariably
sits squarely, with feet planted about
twelve Inches apart and her toes turn
ed out.
"The lean, long-legged woman, on
the other hand, winds her feet round
the legs of her chair, or else crosses
her legs and thrusts her feet out in
front of her.
"Now. the stout woman should
â¢poise' herself and sit very erect. Th*
lean woman should choose the high
est possible seat and plant her feet
firmly on the ground, thus reducing
her excessive angularity.
"The small .woman also does some
peculiar things. She either sits with
her small feet dangling In a helpless
way or perches* herself on the edge of
a high seat, with the toe of one foot
touching the ground arfl the other
fopt hooked around the ankle of the
first. Instead of aggravating the
smallness of her stature, she should
choose the lowest chair in the room
and sink gracefully into it.
"Bat the greatest offender against
the physical art is the mannish girl.
Her very attempt to assume man's
ease and freedom is the cause of her
downfall; her exaggerated attitudes
Indeed become absurd mimicry.
"Yes." said the expert in conclusion,
"women are bad sitters and walkers.
They forget the following primary
rule: 'Whenever the feet are on the
ground af the same time they should
be placed as closely as possible to
gether, toes slightly turned out.' "â

SOLEMN SEASON APPROACHES TO STAY MERRY WHIRL
Gathering at Sacramento Promises to Develop Some
Firm Feminine Views on Varied Topics.
The Federation convention is almost
upon us. On the Sth Sacramento will
see a gathering of the clans â and In
cidentally the exposition of some rather
firm feminine views, for the federation
delegate is nothing if not firm. It is
on her individuality and strength that
fche becomes a delegate, these elements
overwhelming, in most instances, her
social popularity. To be sure, there
ere a few misfitsâ as alwaysâ that will
answer "present" at roll call that were
sent because, as the president-makers
say, lack of timber.
The expenses of travel v and accom
modation ' must be borne by the dele
gates themselves, and it has not yet
become a matter of record that the
average clubwoman Is o'erwilling to go
down Into her rurse to pay for club
honors. However, as an exposition of
the leaders of California's women
clubsâ which means the women that
are active agents in the world's work â
or play. Sacramento will hold the
trump card.
One of the discussions that is bound
to cause voluble and voluminous dis-,
cussion is the primal subject of the
uses of the State Federation â if any.
The Contury Club never came under
the banner of the State body, affiliat
ing with the national organization di
rectly â for reasons best known to itself.
Conservatism, perhaps. .
Then the Sorosis declared Its inten
tion of withdrawal from the. State
body, declaring that as the club was
purely a social and cultured body it
had nothing at moment Ho report Â«"t the
district or : State meetings, and fur
ther, that its members were nearly all
; . tivo workers in some of the many
philanthropir-orcivicbodies that flourish
throughonucW city. Hence the with*
drawal.* \en, a few things were said
Client th<* withdrawal, but now comes
another club, one <>f the foremost of
the cftver and wideawake bodies In
the city with c similar intention.
"Which one? Well, now, that would bD
J- llin,:. , But just watch out for a se
cession in the San Francisco district.
Now* for another subject of import
â the divorce question, coming up on
Thursd.-iy evening, the 11th inst. This
most "'difficult" subject â which is pro
gram'med "A Uniform Divorce Law,"
by Albert H. Elliott of Oakland â is
ont? thco will require tongs to -handle,
inasmuch as many of the best club
women in the State have been honor
ahly divorced.- We hope Mr. Elliott
will, prove himself a diplomatic club
woman and avoid the pitfalls. How
ever, should he trip up some of (he
delegates, being of the male persua-
Kion M he doesn't fear "dishonorable
discharge for conduct unbecoming a
clubwoman and a lady" â such as hap
pened to our two confreres of the
Prefs Club recently.
The matter of delegates to the bi
ennial convention at St. Louis is still
in lhe air. ' It Is possible â yea. even
probable â that State President Iilrs.
M. E. Darling may be re-elected, as
she has been most acceptable to all
portions. However, in any case the
State president will go on as one of
the throe delegates-at-Iarge. Besides
there will be one delegate from each
of the six State districts, and two more
delepates-at-large (exclusive of the
president): and it will devolve upon
each district delegation to decide who
shall represent it at the great biennial.
Now ye who think women deficient
in intelligent manipulation of politics
should have an ey*Â» upon the hench
women of the likeliest ' delegates.
Clever? Why, they can give cards
and spades to many of thÂ«Â»ir male
contemporaries for finesse â which., by
the way, is really not saying over
much to their credit.
It is pretty generally conceded that
Los Angeles and San Francisco will di
vide honors, as to delegates-at -large â .
but, alas! there are three. Where can
t"he third come from? Surely not
from the south, and surely not from
'.he north. Ah! Thene isÂ» the one
chance of a life time of the midland
counties setting the honors. If the
Kbell of Oakland, the Adelphian of
Alameda and the San Jose Woman's
Club get busy they may unite upon
that one delegate.
On the 21st of February, beginning
on Sunday night, the California State
<vraference of Charities and Correc
tions will meet in its third annual ses
sion.
This body aided materially in bring
ing about the legislation in California
that created the Juvenile Court, the
State Board of Charities and Correc
tions and a system' of probation for
older sinners against the law. Special
ists will talk upon their special topics.
The sessions of this body should be
intensely interesting to all sociologists
â or even to the casual observer of the
lives of his fellow men. All that are
interested are invited to the sessions â
the meeting plan to be announced later.
If the Forum Club has ever had a
mnre interesting day than last Wednes
day it has been my misfortune to miss
it-

Being a generous clubwoman, the
president induced Henry Payot to
address the club upon their travels in
Indiaâ which he did in splendid style,
illustrating his talk by views thrown
upon a screen. Step by step the guests
wandered over the marvelous struc
tures of the old civilizationâ stood be
fore the marble tomb of Taj at Agra
and the famous pearl mosque at Agra,
one of the most exquisite structures
in the world. Then a half hour was
Kj>ent in Bombay, the city of the Par-
FeesÂ«, the transplanted Persians, and
followers of the great Persian philoso
pher, Zoroaster. And herewith the epi
tome of their religious belief was given
by Mr. Payot as "Good thoughts, good
words, cood d^r>ds." Is not that the
rpltom^ of all ennobling faiths?
The Parsf-o8 worshiping the fire,
rarth and wat^r refrain from smoking
and from polluting the earth or water
by interring thoir dead. On the screen
was thrown a picture of a place of
sepulchre, which gave forth the most
distinctive note Â«f the lecture. It was
a circular, unroofed structure of ce
ment, called the Tower of Silence,
usually on an eminence, upon whose
walls an almost unbroken row of vul
tures satâ fat from undue gorging â
awaiting an approaching funeral.

descriptive cleverness of the lecturer.
Though the address was of an hour and
a half's duration, every moment was
of intense interestâ and let it be cried
from the housetops â only two women
found it necessary to go out meanwhile.
Whyâ O, whv must women flutter in
and out of their club like a covey of
quail? Haven't they ballast enough to
sit through a number without dodging
in and out when a singer or a speaker
is seeking to entertain? It is unques

The Press" Association on Monday
last held a session of exceptional Inter
est, largely because of the originality
of "the programme and the personality
of the. speakers. Mrs. Pinney presided
w ith her usual tact, presenting Edward
Tillson, who gave two clever piano
solos, followed by Mrs. Edith .Auffrey,
a prominent member of the Press Club
of London, who gave a charming talk
upon the club life of women in the Eng
lish capital, dwelling upon many phases
and incidents of life with which we are
unfamiliar. An analytical sketch of
the late Queen caused much discussion
later over the tea cup*. The trials of
journalists and editors -and, incident
ally, the compensation*! â were handled
seriously and otherwise by them that
should knowâ Mrs. Frank P. Deering.
Mrs. H. Colburn (formerly Mrs. Frona
Eunice Waite) and Frank H. Winch,
who is still a scribe in 'active service.
The consensus of opinion was that the
women that write for the papers are
not in the "hot bird and cold bottle"
classâ that journalistic bohemianism
was distinctly not a prerogative of
newspaper women. Mrs. Mary E. Hart
closed the aftern ->n with some clever
tales of the far north.

The Corona Club once every year
opens its doors to its menfolkâ to hus
bands, sons, brothers and friends â that
they might imbibe some of the aca
demic air that pervades the intellectual
elubrooms. Did the men respond? In
deed they did. en masse. And a de
lightful time they had as guests "at a
woman's club," where they drank club
tea and listened to club chat in right
brave fashion. We are slowly but in
evitably tending toward the ideal club,
where both men and women may be
come members. What will become of
the babies then? The same disposition
as is made now when parents slip off

SINGERS
TO GIVE
CONCERT
VOCALISTS WHO WILL SING
TO-MORROW ; NIGHT AT
"STEIN WAY HALL.
Grape Davis Northrup and
Mrs. O. Nicholson to
An evening song recital of unusual
interest is to be given to-morrow even
ing at Steinway Hafl by Mrs. Grace
Davis Northrup, â  soprano, and Mrs.
Carroll Nicholson, contralto, with
Fred Maurer at the piano.
Mrs. Northrup and Mrs. Nicholson
are both well known in this city and
around the bay and are ranked among
our best soloists, their singing in con
cert, oratorio and church being of the
first order.
Mrs. Northrup's volte is of the
dramatic order, c!ear and strong, yet
very sweet and under perfect control
in the lighter tlorid music. Mrs. Nichol
son has a rich, velvety voice, of gBeat
compass, and she sings with marked
shading andÂ°intelligence. The fact that
Mr. Maurer will be at the piano is suf
ficient evidence that" the /iccompani
ments will be handled' in a masterly
manner and proper support â  be given
the soloisis.
Mrs. NorthrupV success in the "Sta-o
bat Mater," presented under Mascagnl's
direction during "his recent visit here,
her many appearances as soloist at the
Loring Club concerts, the Grand Army
Encampment receptions, Mechanics'
Pavilion concerts and oratorio and con
cert in all of the cities around the bay
have placed her among the favored so
pranos of the vicinity. Mrs."- Nichol
son's marked, successes in the presenta
tion of Handel's "Messiah" and other
leading oratorios In Oakland, her splen
did rendition of solos at- the recent
Bankers' convention .reception at the
Art Institute and other large receptions
and concerts have caused her to be re
garded among the best equipped con
traltos Jn our local society.
A jather novel feature of the enter
tajnment will be the fact, that several
society young ladles are to officiate in
the capacity of ushers during the even
ing.
The splendid blending of the soprano
and contralto voices during the even
ing's'recital'will.certainly be noted, as
it has been in the past, when Mrs. Nor

peared' together on the same pro

CHINESE HAVE STRANGE"
IDEA OF ANATOMY
Believe the Unman- Body Contains
Fire. Water. Earth and
Souic Metals.
No Chinese representative of the
healing art has ever dissected any por
tion of the human frame. Accordingly
their ideas of Anatomy and physiology
are matters bt faith â confirmed by
images which have been reproduced
during untold, centuries, says American
Medicine. Their osteology teaches that
the skull is formed of one bone; so is
the pelvis; the number of ribs varies
with the individual, and at the junction
of the arm with the forearm is placed
a cubital patella. According to Chinese
snjanchology, the small intestine com
municates with the cavity of the heart,
while the colon, after describing sixteen
circumvolutions, terminates by opening
into the lung. The heart governs the
vital processes -^ in co-operation with
the cavity of the stomach it supplies
all ideas and all pleasurable sensations.
The liver is the habitat of the soul, and
it is from this gland that all noble and
generous sentiments emanate. -'
The gall bladder is a receptacle of
courage; its ascent in the body is the
cause of a fit of anger. They have
an idea of the continuous motion of;
the blood, but it seems to be' the pro
duct of an imagination more riotously
Oriental than even that which created
the other items of their physiologic
knowledge. They do not know the pul
monary circulation: they, naturally,
know nothing of the valves in thfe
veins; they do not even appear to have
quite grasped the- motor function of
the heart itself; but they nevertheless
profess to differentiate no less than
seventy-four varieties of pulse â simul
taneously' recognizable on, the person
of a single individual! In its ultimate
structure the body is composed^ of five
elements-t-flre, water, earth, wood and
metal. Each of these elements is in
a harmonious rapport with the corre
sponding members of the series of five
planets, five metals, five solid viscera,
five colors and five tastes. All diseases
originate from disturbances of the pri
mary and essential quintic harmonies
of these correlations.â Exchange.
The Xew Medal of Honor.
â¢ The Consresslonal medal of honor
has so many points of resemblance to
the medal of the Grand Army of the
Republic that one is frequently mis
taken for the other. For that reason
a new design has been made for the
medal of honor? with a view of mak
ing it more distinctive. It is a five
pointed star, like the old medal, but
differs from it in many essential fea
tures. The design "was prepared by a
committed selected by Secretary

An American scientist a fe # w months
ago published a list of "lost arts." but
failed to include the long-neglected art
of keeping youngsters out of mischief.
The free circus games of classic an
tiquity solved the problem Tor 800 years.
They had nothing to do with man
slaughter in Greece, little or nothing in
nine-tenths of the Roman provinces.
Most of the country towns were too
poor to indulge in gladiatorial festivals
and indemnified themselves with acro
batics and zoological side shows. The
Roman lanistea. or dealers in wild
beasts, had agents in every seaport
town and customers in every city, from
Syria to Spain. . The citizens insisted
on free thows.
The supply of that demand cost the
Government millions in standing
arenas, but saved billions in standing
armies. It had to feed and train all
the monsters it could get hold of, but
even a few boxes full of dragons would
have been cheaper than barracks full
of dragoons; batches of grizzlies less
expensive than battalions of grena
diers. ' â¢*>
Titus. Trajan and Hadrian often
turned loose a hundred trained lions in
one day; but they kept the world quiet
with twenty-five legions. They knew
that they had to choose between recre
ations and revolutions, between menag
eries and mutinies. All in all, theirs
was a choice of lesser evils. ?; -
Their committees of free popular en
tertainment have piven way to asso
ciations for the suppression of popular
pastimes; and military expenditures
have increased twenty-eight times. De
prived of the spice that would make
the bread of toll digestible, millions
having yielded to the temptation of
fuddling with conspiracies. Blue laws
have provoked the red flag of anarchy.
And as sure as the burden of the war
tax will finally become intolerable, the
alternative of classic Rome will have
to lÂ»e readopted; but reform, like char
ity. Fhould begin at home.

The station agent of a little Texas
border town a few years go had a
oair of capuchin monkeys left on his j
hands, and finding time between traim
rather dull, decided to adopt the weaz
cn-faoed waifs. There was a big pile
of old boxes in the rear of his freight- I
house, and with a dime's worth of wire
nai!s and e> Ht'.le blue paint he con
triveu to rig out quite an attractive
looking ape asylum. Besides a hay
stuffed dormitory and a big feeding
trough, the prisoners had a water tank.
a horizont_l bar, a grapple swing and
several playthings that could be rolled j
around the sand-covered eround floor. !
Thus encouraged, the four-hanJed ac
robat- "acted" while daylight lasted,
and if applause can reward accom
plishment had no cause for complaint.
The platform of the little freight depot
was crowded with sightseers. Traffic
Improved, shippers would go out of
their way to patronize that special sta
tion and get an excuse for enjoying the
free show. In rainy weather the
youngsters of the neighboring school
house, who used to pass their recess in
a vacant tobacco barn now made a
rush for the "monkey house" and
agreed to respect the by-law against
smoking. There was an anti-rowdy
regulation, too, and young hoodlums
behaved to propitiate the proprietor of
the free circus. The only malcontent
of the settlement was the owner of a
Mexican restaurant, wfth dramshop
annex.
Before the summer had lasted a
month loafing in the Mexican's den
had almost stopped. To accommodate
the crowd the free museum was now
and thrn shifted to an adjoining wood
shed, where an amphitheater of cord
wood offered a chane ; for - eserved
seats. Visitors came from distant
ranches for the special purpose of see
ing the capuchins act, and applause
before long led to imitation. The at
tractions of the woodshed tabernacle
were completed by all sorts of gymnas
tic apparatus. Even the Mexican then
recouped his losses; his youngsters
peddled cakes and soda water. There
was a slight risk of more tonic bever
ages, but the station agent could quote
the regulation against the sale of in
toxicants.
A zoological .museum with a temper
ance restaurant could be made a factor
of 1 Torm in hundreds of American
country towr.s. ' A free exhibition of
boa constrictors would save the natives
from the risk of more distressing ser
pents.
But for purposes of domestic redemp
tion even a case full of white rats
would often give desired results. There
is no end of fun watching the tricks of
the indefatigable little foragers, and
the jxmultiply like patriots in a pension
office.
The speckled varieties of pet rats are
as active as weasels and bold enough
to tackle competitors ten times their
size. If permitted to run about the
floor they have no hesitation to charge
muskrats and even rabbits, three or
four bouncers sneaking up from differ
ent sides and then making a simulta
neous rush, on Von Moltke's principle
of converging march routes.
An amusing phenomenon is the danc
ing mania of pet cranes, that can be
bought on the Rio Grande for $1 apiece.
Standing listless on one foot, the Amer
ican cousin of the stork might be sus
pected of paralysis, but suddenly start
ins as from a dream will flop his wings
nnd dance about in a circle, then for
ward aga!n like the leader of a minuet,
or even backward, with zigzag hops, all
lhÂ« while turning his head left " and
risht. like a star actor challenging ad

And #o, you young "engaged'* people
think 5"t*i can "make each other over"
after you are maxrietf? Ah! â¢ Perhaps
you also think you can cure a cat from
scratching, a dog from fcltlng And a
horse from balking! You evidently
know but little about the -vitality and
obstinacy of personal characteristics.
When a young girl talks glibly about
reforming a drunkard, we old fellows,
who know life, must be pardoned if we
heave a sigh. When a young man con
fides in us that his sweetheart is a
llirt, but that he proposes to "take it
out vf her" after the wedding day, we
cannot help shaking our heads. If you
want to make any great change in
your loved one, better try it before the
wedding ceremony. It will certainly
be easier then than later on. Remem
ber, please, that though you do your
hair up 'in curl paper every night, it
always unkinks on. the following day.
The old proverb does not say â as the
wife inclines .the husband bends!
Ask people who have been married
twenty-five or thirty years whether
they have ever succeeded in effecting
any great alterations in: each other's
character, i Xinety-nine out of a hun
dred will answer emphatically, No!
What they have all observed is the con
stant intensification of original char
acteristics. Or, where great changes
have come, they are not along the lines
they had marked 'out.' The fact of the
matter is (however little to our credit)
human nature resents deliberate efforts
at alteration by others. Constant and
reiterated criticism and correction
anger us and produce an obstinate re
action. We can change little children,
but not "grown-ups." "It is hard to
teach an old doer new tricks." Let a
woman tell her husband three times a
day "not to eat with his knife," and at
the end of a month he will probably
throw his fork out of the. window. JLet
a woman ask her husband every time
he goes out of doors if he has brushed
his hair, and some night he will come
home with it shaved close to his head.
Too much and too oft repeated criticism
raises an evil spirit in us.
The bottom facts about the influence
of married people over each other are
these: Influence here (as everywhere)
is largely unconscious. What we really
try to do, we fail to accomplish. If we
alter each other at all, it Is in unex
pected ways, and almost invariably by
example and not by criticism or sug
gestion.
Did you ever happen to notice that
the marriage ceremony sayBâ not will
you "make" each other better or
worse, but will you "take" each
other for better or for worse? There
is nothing better worth remembering
than thisâ that we "take" each other
for what we are, and not for what we
can "make" each other to become.
Nothing but disappointment and un
happiness can result from these nae
ging efforts to alter the characteristics
and dispositions of our husbands and
wives. It is easy not only to drive
them into open rebellion, but to goad
ourselves into unhappiness over their
most trivial defects.
Suppose a man's wife has a snub
nose! He has to put up with it> doesn't
he? Could anything be more foolish
than for him to say, "Until this wo
man gets that snub out of her nose
I will not even enjoy her pretty hair
and her beautiful teeth!" You may
reply that this is a physical and ir
remediable defect, but that her bad
grammar or her carelessness about her
attire is not! Well, you may argue as
you will, your dilemma remains the
same. You can either overlook a de
fect you cannot cure and enjoy virtues
that are real and beautiful, or you
can keep nagging way at this one 1 de
fect until you are both of you mad,
and the happiness has all gone out of
your home.
Of course there are vices of the soul
which I do not believe we are called
upon to endure in one another. There
are even minor deficiencies of a nature
against which we ought perhaps to
make a resolute stand. But these are
only the exceptions.
The rule isâ take each other as you
are! Overlook the imperfections that
you cannot cure. Keep your thoughts
away from them. Pass them by. There
are quiet, gentle ways of exerting a
pressure on the bad habit, if you only
do not let it irritate you and make
your heart unhappy. But it is a
thousand times better to let it alone
and forget it. Just' keep thinking about
all those other good and noble quali
ties!
Isn't it a dreadful thing to see some
super-refined and hypercritical woman
allowing herself to be exasperated by
her husband's habit of picking his
teeth, to such a degree that his de
votion, purity, unselfishness, courage
and honor are all forced into , an
eclipse? The habit is a bad one â yes!
But it isn't bad enough to' justify your
riling his temper and rousing the' devil
that lies buried in his heart. And' it
isn't bad enough to warrant your get
ting that excitable spirit of yours all
perturbed. Just try and remember how
easy it is to become critical and how
like a maggot the fault-finding dispo
sition grows.
War Over Mills.
In the case of Ada Crowling vs. Joe
Mudrow, recently decided in the Su
preme Court of Arkansas, a controversy
involving one-quarter of a cent was
decided. The* case involved the title
to a piece of land which had been sold
for taxes, and the title was attacked
because of the alleged Illegal sale.
The case was tried on an agreed
statement of facts, which showed that
the legal amount for which it could be
sold was $4 28%, while the sale was
made by the collector for $4 29, thus
exceeding the legal amount by one
quarter of 1 cent. In the opinion Jus
tice Hughes said:
"The only question in this case is.
Does a sale of land for one-Quarter of
a cent more than Is due upon it render
the sale void? It is true that a sale of
land for taxes for an amount substan
tially in excess of the amount due upon
It will render the sale void. But in
this case the overcharge was not sub
stantial, being for only one-quarter of
a cent, an amount less than the least
coin issued by the Government.
"To hold this sale invalid would seem
to be absurd. There would be no wa%
of making the exact change, and it
seems trivial, and more reasonable that
the party whose duty it was' to pay the
tax should pay one-quarter of a cent
too much than that the Government
should lose three-quarters of a cent.
The excess in this case was trifling and
did not invalidate the sale."â American

TRADE MORE UNSETTLED. .
COMMERCIAL conditions were not as bright last
week as daring the several preceding weeks. In
tensely cold weather checked all branches of busi
ness for several days and seriously interfered with rail
way transportation, while reports from the iron and steel
industry were unfavorable. The spring demand for mer
chandise, just opening, was brought almost to a standstill
by the zero weather, and building operations in a Urge
number m cities and towns were almost, suspended.
Speculation, too, which was showing signs "of resump
tion, fell off again, and altogether the situation prtÂ«efitÂ«d
a quiet** asptctj while there was less optimism expressed
in the regular weekly "reports ta the different mercantile
agencies, i'or all of these less favorable the
weather wÂ»s probably largely responsible* Nobody &els
like <ToiÂ«g business or moving goods with the thermom
eter ranging from.ze"ro to 40 and 50 degree* below. -C\ ''â 
The South, however, being out of the path of the re
markable cold wave, sent in gooct reports, the section
feeling the stimulus of the boom in cotton. High 'prices
for this great staple have sent a thrill over the whole
Southern region and an enormous acreage is promised
for the coming season. Toward the close of the week
there was a break in prices, however, and an enormous
business in futures was done at New. York and New Or
leans. 0 The bulls were still full of confidence, however,
the leaders were heavy buyers at the declin o e and the
week closed firm. /But those interests handling cotton in
a legitimate way, such as wholesalers and manufacturers,
continued to regard the rrfarket with a cautious eye and
bought ho more thtm absolutely necessary to fill imme
diate requirements. The future oÂ°f cotton goods is caus
ing a good deal. of speculation among manufacturers re
garding the course of quotations, during the ( year, and all
mills show a disposition to go slowly and thus avoid
being, caught with large lines of high-priced material,
which the public may not be able to take off their hands.
The iron and steel trade", tdo,is in. aft unsettjed condi
tion. The returns f/ojn the, industry *at the close of .the
year are reported less encouraging and rumors of a pro
posed cut in quotations make the trade shy about oper
ating. The Iron Age in a recent rather pessimistic re
view of the. market, bluntly said that the conditions were
less favorable and that the trade must adjust itself to
them. These rumors and admissions from, well-posted
authorities affected the stock o market,*and the further re
port that the dividend on the preferred stock of the
steel corporation might be reduced produced an'unfa
vorable effect on Wall streetand sent the whole line of
stocks down several points. The bull leaders, "tired of
sustaining the market, quietly stepped aside and the
market fell? back of its own weight. Private wires from
New York brokers to their San Francisco correspondents
said that the bull interests found themselves confronted
by a stope wall, that they were loaded with large lines
of stocks without a market and that, though large inter
ests were still arrayed on the bull side, the bears were
steadily becoming more aggressive. .Â«/.;.
Another disturbing feature in the stock market wKich
led to the weakening in values was the freely expressed
opinion that cheap and plentiful montfy was not likely.tb
continue much longeft Early ratification of tjie Panama
canal treaty, .wolild moon the. payment of millions of dol
lars to Panama and the canal coif.pany stockholders, while
there are certain overhanging new capital issues which
might draw on the money market and thus advance
rates. Another factor in this situation is the decline in
thÂ£ inflow of currency to New York. Of course much of
this is hypothetical and may not occur; but it has its ef
fect, on the money market just the same.- When mopey
is concerned a rumor is often more potent than a fact in
depressing the market. We igiow the fact and can see
what h is doing, but we do not know what a rumor may
result in, and uncertainty stops the financial machinery
until the outlook becomes more clearly N defined. .
The situation in the We'St, like that in the East, has"
been more uncertain of late. The large outside pu.r
chasing^of prpvisions, . wlfich has recently been the chief
feature on~ the Chicago Board of Trade, is diminishing,
and though the packers have unloaded large lines of their
product on* the general public stocks are reported ac
cumulating; receipts of hogs are larger than a year ago
and a continued liberaj. movement in hogs is freely pre
dicted, which points to lower quotations for provisions,
later on. The tendency now is to sell, as the market is
becoming rather unwieldy. The crop" outlook continues
good, as the wheat is well covered with snow and thus
protected from the freezing weather over a great portion
of the belt, and tho'ugh the top growth of the plant is
small the root growth is healthy and enlarging. The
wheatr.market itself presents no especially new features.
The world has plenty of the grain, is not buying with
any 'eagerness, and whatever excitement appears in the
market is caused by thÂ§ manipulations of Armour, who
is doing something or other with the market, nobody
knows exactly what.
The 'bank clearings of the country still continue above
$2,000,000,000 per week and the losses and gains as com
pared with the corresponding period in .1903 are about
equally" distributed among the largest cities, the net in
crease lor the week being 1.2 per cent. The increase at
New York was practically rill, being .8 pef cent, and the
largest increase was at New. Orleans, 81.2 per cent, due
wholly to the enormous dealings in cotton there. Pitts
burg, the center oMhe'iron and steel industry, lost, 22.1
per cent, and Chicago, the center of the grain and pro
vision trades, lost .3 per -cent. The failures during the
week were 302, against 243 last year, while the railway
earnings for January were 3.8 per cent larger than in Jan
uary, 1903.
Conditions on this coast remain as previously reported.
The markets here are now largely a question of weather.
There has been, sufficient rainfall in the central and
northern- parts of the State for the present, but the south
is still suffering, with the cattle and sheep dying in some
of the southern counties. Taking the State as a wlible
the crop outlook is fair and the commercial and financial
situation excellent.
THE FERRY ODORS.
THE letter from a subscriber which appeared in The
Call January 28 suggesting that a sure way to re
mind San Franciscans at the; St. Lbuis Exposition
of home would be to there reproduce in the copy of the
union ferry depot the 'familiar odors "of stale fish, de
cayed vegetables, horse manure ââ  and other vile smells
through which the commuters have -to pass," "has inspired
another open letter printed in this paper on the 30th inst.
to the same end and suggesting that . a remedy in 'the
shape of frequent washing of the docks be applied.
There can be no question las to the justice of com-
plaint in this matter, but frequent washing of the docks
is not the remedy. The cause itself should be removed.
The experience of a thousand or more passengers dodg
ing for their lives horses attached to heavily laden
wagons filled with all manner of materials not primarily
intended as Arabian perfumes is not a comfortable one.
Standing trucks of poultry, fish, fruit and vegetables, each
adding its .unit to the ill-smelling whole/are scarcely
esthetic and are very disagreeable if not unhealthy. Any
one familiar with the ferry knows what is referred to,
Â»f>d to jnaJte a verbal analysis of its too familiar smells
Would fee ; impossibft. There is a 0 nuisance .there which
has been xoieratrd too long Â«n<i should be removed. ThÂ«
terminus of a great transcontinental railroad/ which. 'is
the gateway throjtgh which thousand*. pour almost con
stantly from its overland and suburban traffic. Justifies
providing Â« passageway fof.passtrtgefs away from the
datfgejf t>i teams and the offenses spoken of (â¢' -
"\ There, is one other point in this connection which may
be noted in the interest of comfort, if not health, and that
is the open drinking water tanks on the main deck's of
many of the ferry boats. A rusty tin cup hangs by a
chain and the thirsty are compelled to dip down into the
common pot, where thousands of others' have dipped be
fore them. They dip, sip^ and drip. this. corporation nec
tar, and not infrequently what is left in the cup is
thriftily returned to its common font to mix with the
like savings of thousand^ of others, but to be again
dipped up and dripped back by the next thirsty victim.
The custom of drinking- from the water that has been
touched to the lips of some men might be dangerous.
The matter'could be easily remedied by simply using a
closed tank with a faucet.
San Francisco must keep , pace with the best that is,
and while she may not be expected to 'welcome all guests
at her front door with cut flowers she must at least show
the common courtesies attaching to a host by providing
pure water and a clean entrance to the city.
In its efforts to ferret out the terrorizing rascal' that
sought to levy blackmail by the threat of wreck and
wholesale murder the Southern Pacific Company is doing
the State a distinct service by rounding up ex-convicts
abroad in the land. It is well to keep an eye on these
worthies and trust only to that reformation which the
menace of penitentiary gates inspires.
FEDERAL PROHIBITION.
AN attempt is on in Congress to make the Federal
Government a participant in the sumptuary sys
tem of the States^whicii affect to prohibit the use
of liquors. In soifte of sucK States liquors, even wine,
beer and cider, are outlawed; they, cease to be property
and are subject to seizure and destruction, leaving' the
owner without recovery or remedy.
Up to this time the right of a citizen to have in his own
house and for his own use liquors has been protected by
the interstate commerce . laws. When sent 'from one
State into another io the original package property in
liquor has been inviolable. A citizen of Kansas can buy
a case. of wine in California and have it shipped to his
home for use as part of the diet on his own table, and
the prohibition law of Kansas cannot touch it because it
is commerce originating in another State. Now it- is
proposed to stop this. Mr. Hepburn, who represents a
prohibition State in Congress, has introduced into the
House a bill which provides that when liquor in original
package is consigned from one State into another as
soon as it enters the State of its destination becomes
subject to all the laws of the latter State.
This means that when a case of California wine enters
Kansas, consigned to a citizen. of that State for his pri
vate use. it ceases to be property.. The car or warehouse
or the owner's house may be entered by force and the
wine taken out- and destroyed! The proponents of the
bill claim for Congress the right to pass it under that
clause in. the Federal constitution which gives to Con
gress the right to regulate commerce between the States.
We are not aware that the courts haye yet held that
under that grant of power Congress may destroy com
merce between the States. Wine is an important article"
of commerce produced in California." Has Congress the
right to prohibit commerce therein between California
and Kansas, Iowa, Maine, Texas and South Carolina?
It is known that in the prohibition cult tobacco ranks
next to liquor. How long will it be before that is pro
hibited by the same^States and the tobacco producing
States will fall under Federal prohibition of their com
merce? "When the right of sumptuary legislation is once
conceded a wide field is opened for interference with
natural* right.
â¢ It is a dangerous experiment for Congress to destroy
the equal application of the commercial law of the coun
try by forbidding commerce between any of the States in
any property that has legal existence and protection at
the place of its origin. â¢.
In morals it is a serious question whether force has
ever produced permanent good. The work* of Father
Mathew and the old .Washingtbnians did more for ab
stention from the abuse of liquor than has. been done by
the modern idea of force. Congress should long con
sider before it makes the Federal Government a party to
the idea of forcing morals or religion by law upon any of
bur citizens. ... â :, '' . . &MWB&
POWER AND LIGHT.
THE annual number of The Journal of Electricity,
Power and Gas constitutes a valuable contribution
to the- journalistic record of the progress of San
Francisco along all lines of industrial development. The
number is creditable not only to the management of the
Journal, but' to the city as well;, for it affords evidence
that in our structural work and in our use of electrical
energy and. electrical appliances we .are * abreast of the
moÂ«t progressive cities of the age. ' .
There is no longer any doubt that electricity is to
furnish most of .the artificial power and. light used by
civilization in the immediate future;: but comparatively
few people realize to what extent it already provides for
the heeds of the city in those respects. The various arti
cles of this annual of the Journal will, therefore, furnish
Something of surprise to its readers, for while it is in no
sense of the word a "boom" number, it nevertheless
shows San Francisco- in a manner that' will increase her
prestige 'as a city of light and energy.

Increase of Insanity.
London, says Dr. Robert Jones, is re
sponsible for the production of over
seventy insane, persons a week. In 1859
there were in England 36,762 insane, or
1 to 536 of the population; there are
to-day 113.964. or 1 to 293. The re
covery rate from all cases of mania
is also decreasing, being now* 38.4 per
cent. Melancholia Is Increasing, and
also premature dementia. The same
complaint comes . from the continent.
Some statisticians contend that the in
crease is not real, but due to better
census taking, segregation" and the
great increase of the population, but
there is a general conviction that the
increase is altogether too definite to
be explained In those ways. For the
past six ye?ars the total increase of
the insane in both public and private
institutions of New York has averaged
708, but the increase to October 1, 1903,
was 941 over the previous year. The
increase in the State hospitals, not in
cluding the two asylums for the crim
inal insane, was 918, as against 663,
the average of the past six years. There
are at present nearly 26.000 patients In
the insane asylums of the State. Dr.
White of Washington contends that
there is more insanity in New Eng
land than elsewhere; and the amount
decreases steadily as one goes from
Boston west, or from Boston south.â

Disastrous Irony.
"Sigma," w_hose "personalia" Is
published by Doubleday, Page & Co.,
relates the following incident to show
the effect of irony upon the average
jury:
'â¢The irony of Lord Bo wen, a noted
jurist, once proved very disastrous,"
says Sigma. "He was trying a bur
glar, and by way of mitigating the
tedium of the proceedings summed up
the case in the following fashion:
" 'You will have observed, gentle
men, that the prosecuting counsel laid
great stress on the enormity of the
offense with which the prisoner is
charged, but I think it is only due to
thÂ« prisoner io point out that in pro
ceeding aboat his enterprise he, at all
events, displayed remarkable consid
eration for the inmates of the house.
For instance, rather than disturb the
owner, an Invalid lady, as you will
have remarked, with commendable
solicitude he removed his boots and
went about in his stockings, notwith
standing the inclemency of the weath
er. Further, instead of rushins with
heedless, rapacity into the pantry, he
carefully removed the coal-scuttle and
any other obstacles which, had he
thoughtlessly collided with them,
would have created a noise that would
have aroused the jaded servants from
th^ir well-earned repose."
"The Judge then dismissed the jury
to consider their verdict, and was
horror-struck when they soon re
turned, to court and pronounced for
the acquittal of the prisoner."

ASSIGNMENT OF INTERESTâSub
scriber. City. The assignment of the
interest of the mortgage may be made
by a proper instrument and when the
same is recorded It affords constructive
notice to all persona of the rights o'
the assignee against an unauthorized
discharge or a subsequent assignment.
In. a few States a mortgage is not as
signable by law, but the assignment of
the note carries the mortgage with it
in equity.
AFTER DINNER SPEECHESâNov
ice, City. What a person should say
when called upon to make an after din
ner speech depends altogether upon
conditions. No general rule can be laid
down. If it is to be an Impromptu re
sponse, say but a few words; If a set
toast, the toastrhaster generally notifies
the person selected, and then the speak
er has time to prepare and should talk
to the subject and not away from it.
NATIONAL HYMNâ A. J., . City.
The United States has no national
hymn, that is no hymn has been so
declared, but by common consent "The
Star Spangled Banner," "America"
and "Hail Columbia" are recognized as
the national airs. Two of these have
a smack of official sanction in the fact
that in the United States navy the
band, where there is a band on ship
board, plays "The Star Spangled Ban
ner" at morning colors and "Hail Co
lumbia" at evening colors.

SUGAR IN WINEâ Subscriber, City.
Sugar is found In all wines, though in
certain kind* very little exists. Ac
cording to Frescenlas the sugar in four
kinds of Rhine wines amount to exactly
six-sevenths of the extract remaining
af iÂ«sr evaporation. In red Bordeaux
very little sugar is found; red sauterno
contains less than 1 per cent; Hermit
age, 1.7 per cent, hence the quantity
must . be very small. Some kinds of
muscat ylfld 24.5 per cent of an extract,
containing about 22 per cent sugar
Good red wines should contain at least
H per cent of sugar. Tokay wine con
tains 74 grains of sugar to an ounce*
of wine; port, 16, and champagne from
6 to 2S grains.

Scope of California 'S Mining Show at
St. Louis Is Defined.
BY LEWIS JEi AUBURY, STATE MINERALOGIST.
Nearly all the material for the Cali
fornia exhibit at St. Louis is now in
this city and arrangements are beijig
made to ship several carloads early in
February. ' .[.- .' â¢" -..â¢-
The exhibit will be divided into two
classes â an outdoor exhibit and that
which will be placed in the mines
building.. The outdoor exhibit prom
ises to be very interesting, as it will
exemplify by working exhibits the dif
ferent milling and concentration
methods pursued in this State. New
types of roller and stamp mills will
be shown, and as an illustration of
the progess which has been made in
milling in California, a wooden stamp
mill, erected in 1853. the third in the
State, secured in Shasta County, will
be set up with the modern mills. An
other feature of early mining methods
will also be shown, viz., the system
used in the "New Almaden mines when
they were first opened, and which is
in use at the present time in some
parts of Mexico. With this method
the ore is carried out of the mine on
the backs of the miners in a rawhide
â¢â¢seron." or bag, a notched log being
used for a leader.
In the outdoor exhibit will also be
arranged a "monitor" used in hy
draulic mining; also an hydraulic
elevator, undercurrents, etc., illustrat
ing this class of mining. Methods of
drift mining will be illustrated, as
well as the primitive means of saving
gold by the "long torn" rocker and
pan. A typical miner's cabin, with
itÂ« various appurtenances, will also
add to the outside exhibit-
THE BUILDING SHOW
Prominent in the mines building
in the model department will be
shown a working model built to scale
of a modern five-stamp quartz mill,
and the various processes through
which the ore passes from the time
it leaves the mine until it passes over
the concentrator?, at which point in
another model will be shown the tail
ings being elevated to a working
model of a cyanide plant, which will
fully illustrate this process.
With these models will be shown a
type of the modern gold dredge in op
eration; also the latest methods of re
ducing einr.abar ores to native mer
< ury- Many other models will also be
shown, illustrating ore reduction as at
Â»>res.nt practiced.
The oi!s of California will be shown
on an elaborate scale, more so than
has ever been attempted t pas* expo
sitions, and the detailed Information
hich the State Mining Bureau has
b^en collecting for the past three years
vili be made available. Oils from every
district In the State will be shown, with
a commercial analysis cf each sample;
a!so oS! sands and formations in which
i . is found. Miniature" drilling and
pumping outfits will also be included
in the exhibit; also sections of oiled
roads, asphalt pavements and the prac
tical application of petroleum and its
by-products in many ways will be ex
hibited.
Nearly ail the material for the great
composite arch whfch is to adorn the
main entrance to the exhibit has been
collected, and is now being assembled
in this city. Granite blocks from Ma
<Sera, Sacramento, Placer, San Ber
dino and San Diego counties have been
obtained. Colusa. Santa Clara, Solano.
Contra Costa, San Luis Oblspo and
Ventura counties have furnished blocks
of sandstone. Terra cotta and glazed
brirk are supplied by San Francisco
manufacturers, cs wrll as the medal
lions representing the seal of the State
and bears' heads.
EI Dorado County furnishes a course
of â  slate, Los Angeles the necessary
pressed brick, San Diego County pala-
gonite and Oatalina Island travertine.
Marble is supplied by Tuolumne -and
San Bernardino counties.
Structural material which has been
secured has been from different areas,
widely separated! The material select-*
ed has been with- a view. -of not only
showing th~ superiority of < ur build-'
ins material, but the .many different
counties which product- it.
ARCH AT KXTRAXCF.
ThÂ»- arch is to have a height of 23
;nd a width of 174 feet, with a
UtickneM of 6 feet. The entrance is to
be 7 fec-t in width. The blocks of stone
wiil bfc cemented with cement-, from
a pa and San Bernardino 0
counties and a special exhibit of ce
ment will be made from these counties.
One of the most prominent exhibits
will b<> that of borax and soda and
their by-products, that of borax iccu
p; ing a space of 20x20 feet. A large
globe containing water from Owens
Lake will be shown, and beside it will
â¢ residue from the evaporation of
this water and the by-products ob
tained from the residue, with illustra
tion of th* uses to which these by
products may b* applied.
California if prolific in mineral waterg
and the: will be exhibited from twenty
differnt counties, and an analysis of
earn will be given. Mineral substances

inent part c.f the exhibit. Among the
latter leÂ»>idolite or lithia mica from San
nty will furnish perhaps one
of the most striking and beautiful ex
hibits at the exposition. A grotto will

The genr. industry, which is now as
suming s'oi'ne proportions, will be well
represented by chrysoprase from Tu

from Fan Diego County and tourquoise
from San Bernardino County. Besides
these a number of gems of minor im
portance and Jewelers' materials In
great variety will be exhibited.
Another prominent exhibit which no
other State can produce will be niter
from large deposits which have been
found in San Bernardino and. Inyo
counties. Probably no other discovery
In recent years is of as much Import
ance to the State as these deposits,
which in extent rival those of Chile and
which need only the touch of capital to
transform the niter industry Into one
of the most important.
A fine collection of salt has been made
both from the desert deposits and 'the
various evaporation plants in the State.
Massive exhibits of limestone. Infuso
rial earth, sulphur, asphalt and bitu
minous rock, magnesite, gypsum,
graphite, chrome, potter's clay, coal,
fuller's earth, mica and other Indus
trial materials will be made. Massive
exhibits have also been collected of
gold quartz, cinnabar, copper, manga
nese and Iron, which are illustrative of
the average character of these ores.
Thousands of small samples of ores of
all classes have al8o*been collected and
will be exhibited in cabinets.
One of the most important features
which has been arranged is' the Infor
mation bureau. Here it will be possi
ble to obtain information concerning
any mineral deposit In the State. One
wall of the exhibit will be devoted to
the maps of all the mining districts,
and literature describing the same has
been prepared and will be freely dis

REMARKABLE HISTORY.
The developnrent of this industry fur
nishes one of' the most remarkable
chapters In the history of the State, i
From the point of supplying merely
the home market we have built up a :
business which "brought into, the State ;
In 1902 $35,000,000 or $40,000,000 that went :
to the growers (1903 brought us still [
more), not to speak of the money that !
went to the packers, cannery, wine ;

We have practically driven from the '
American market tne French prune!

lemons, figs, almonds and walnuts and
wine and grape brandy; we are rapidly |
marketing side by side with the foreign I
article our preserved fruits and Jams

reaching into foreign countries owlth
many of our fruits. â  The California j
prune is well known In Germany, Eng- !

there is no reason .why the California'

the Valencia or Malaga. The California
apple grower Is a successful competitor

Kesent Action of School Direct

ton, Manager of Playground
WILL 31AKE A /PROTEST
Deposed Man Is Protege of Cali-
f ornia Club, Which Says Suc
cessor Is "Qnly a Pugilist"
By the dismissal of W. H. . Hutton
from the position of" manager of the
.children's playground at Seventh and
Harrison streets the School Directors
have incurred the displeasure of the
ladies of the California Club, and a
storm Is brewing around the heads of
the men who dfrect o the educational
affairs of San Francisco's boys and
girls. â  -\,VjJ
Hutt'on was appointed as manager of
the playground in question when it
â¢was opened three years ago. He was
a protege of the. California Club and
was appointed by the then existing
School Board at the request of the la
dies, who took the most active inter
est in securing "the playground.
It is now' claimed that Hutton has
been deposed for political reasons and
that his successor, Joseph Meyers, is
a personal friend . of School Director
Roncovieri. Meyers is a teacher of
physical culture at the Young Men's
Hebrew Club, but some of the ladies
of th.e California Club declare that
Meyers is "only a pugulist."-
Hutton was given but three days'
notice in which to vacate his post and
turn the keys of the playground over
to Meyers. 9
Hutton says his removal was the re
sult of a political bai'galn in order to
give aqother man his position, as he
was not subject to .civil service. He
claims that the reason given for his
d^missal was that he was not atten
tive to his duties, but he denies the
charge. He says that he built a num
ber of club rooms at the playground
without any cost to the city and that
he has kept all the apparatus in good
condition. * â
Mrs. Mary Kincaid. an ex-member
of the School Board, is very indignant
over Huton's orembval and saysÂ» that
the California Club will make a pro
test to, the School Directors and -to
Mayor Schmitz.
Mrs. Kincaid says that Hutton was
recommended by the California Club
for tHe post ef manager of the chil
dren's playground and that he is a
very, capable man,andjhas shown every
interest in his work. Â°
The children's playground at Seventh
and Harrison streets has been a boon
to that district. The grounds are pat
r&nized weekly by thousands of chili
dren and the police 'say that the chil
dren are kept off the streets and pre
vented from getting into bad" company
by the opportunity for .recreation of

I The essayist who treated the sub
j ject of the raisin at the Fresno.qpn
! vention (a Fresno raisin grower) cffun
i seled ncv <more planting of raisin

| the raisin crop was as large as it was
' in 1902 (I have" not yet collected the
data for J.903), and in ten years the
j output increased only 10,000 tons! Look
at the citrus industry- In 1893 it was
80,757 tons and [ in 1902 it was 225.668
tons, and the orange grower never
; more" prosperous. , TJjere was an in

PLANTING FRUIT TREES. ,
Fruit tree planting is going on all
I the time east of the Rocky Mountains.
I Despite the 'drawbacks, and dlscourage

! fruit growing there, so essential to hu-
I man existence as- an article of food
j is fruit regarded that nothing daunts
the owner of land from making an
effort to meet the ever increasing de
mand. If \the~ soil and climatic con
ditions of the State of Iowa, flr, the
State of Illinois, for example, were the
same as in California, does any one
suppose that the. farmer, would grow
corn 'or., oats or wheat? Certainly not.
The State would soon become one un
broken orchard and no fruit grower
there would worry himself about over
production. â¢
Look at the hundred* of thousands

ALASKA BILLS IN CONGRESS
ARE MANY BUT WORKERS FEW
Friends of Meas
ures Are Not in
Harmony.
BY SAMUEL W. WALL.
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31. â This is a
story of the wilderness of Alaska in
bewildered Washington, too.
If the big district does not get a good
deal of what has been coming Co it for
a long time, in. the matter of legisla
tion, at this sitting ot Congress, Alaska
will have only her own friends to blame.
To scan the bills that have already
been introduced in her* behalf would
leave the impression that Congress was
about to devote the entire session to
the unrepresented and misrepresented
wilderness that forms the northwestern
extremity of this great country. But
there need be no worry as to that.
Alaska needs a lot of things, if the
bills are to be accepted as a sign, but
she will get but- a few. Primarily she
I needs a representative, or representa
tives, in Congress and a new code of
mining laws. It is quite possible that
she could get both of these. If her
friends out of Congress could unite in
, support of any of the bills already in
f troduced. For Alaska has acquired
; many friends on the floor of both
; houses during the past yearâ some of
I them very Influential â and who are
I willing to work for any reasonable
j measure of relief. But the many repre
i sentative Alaskans now In Washington
are all found to have pronounced views
I on essential points that are radically at
variance.
For instance, in the single matter of
a representative there are those who
favor Senator Nelson's bill, providing
1 that such delegate should be appointed,
I while, for the most part, an appointed
delegate is tabooed as worse than none.
Congressman Cushman of Washington,
who is a champion of Alaska, has a
J bill providing for the election of a dele
â¢ gate and declares that the House will
hear to no other. "The Senate can have
an appointed delegate of their own,"
'says he, "but he can't come over to
our side."
Jones of Washington has a bill that
provides for three elective delegates
[and he insists that no other will suit,
as- Alaska Is of such extent that no one
man can properly represent its great
area and varied Interests.
MAY CHANGE LAWS.
With regard to the amending of the
mining laws, concerning which there
has Â«been .more outcry than any of
Alaska's needs, there Is such confusion
of thought that no- man has as yet
been bravft enough' to offer a bill. Sen
ator .Dillingham, who led the Senate
commission into wilderness last
summer, and who is the author of a
big batch of Alaska bills already filed,
has not yet determined" upon this mat
ter, but will present a bill a little later.
Cushman. representative of Washing
ton, who wears an "Alaska Brother
hood" button in the lapel of his coat, is
also preparing a bill. He is in great
doubt, however. He was for cutting
out the "power 'of attorney" privilege
In the matter of locating claims and
very determined about it. He is not
so sure now that this is the thing to do.
"This matter of locating is not the real
evil," he says. "It is -in the holding of
these claims. There Is much to be
said in favor of the power of attorney
In making location, but nothing for
holding these claims Indefinitely with
out their being worked' as against the
miner and prospector who may be
willing to do 'his assessment and de
velop the property and the country."
And yet there is a man here in
Washington who Is said to' hail from
Valdez as a paid representative of the
people there and who claims to-be spe~
claJlly deputized to see to It that a law
be passed by the Congress making as
sessment work upon mining claims in
Alaska in no wise obligatory for" the
holding of claims Indefinitely. It is not
likely that in results he will earn his
wage, but he offers an illustration of
how widely men differ concerning
Alaskan affairs â even Alaskans â and
suggests how difficult It must be for
Congress to agree. upon a measure to
please Its people.
AMENDMENTS PROPOSED.
Judge Wickersham of Alaska is here
in Washington and upon occasion
freely expresses himself as opposed to
any change in the mining laws that
would not be made to apply to general
> mining laws of the United States. In
other words, no special legislation for
Alaska. His argument is that the
, mining laws are known to' the miners
and prospectors and any change would
create confusion In their minds and
set up special standards for the dis
! trlct not to its best interests. -
[ . Senators Dillingham and Nelson
have introduced, and Senalor Perkins
will introduce, a bill for the creation
of a new judicial district in Alaskif.
The special objection urged to the
bills is that they use latitude and lon
gitude as dividing lines for the propos
| ed district, while nobody In Alaska
I knows where those lines -are. The
pie of. the man who failed when his
neighbor under like conditions suc
ceeded.
Let us see what f ait growing means"
In some European countries where the
ghost ? of overproduction seldom enters.
The vineyards of France In 1897 em
braced 1,623,567 hectares (a hectare Is
two and a half acres), equivalent to 4,
058,917' acres. Our acreage of vines is
about 300,000 and all other fruits about
as much more. France exported to the
United Kingdom wine valued at
Â£3,751,763 or $18,768,815, and brandy
valued at, Â£1,300,182 or $6,500,
910. The United Kingdom Im
ported from Spain fruits valued
at Â£3,026,464 cr $15,132,320, and Of
wine' Â£807,410 or $4,037,050. I have no
data of the many thousa- s of acres in
France devoted to apples, prunes, olives
'"- and other f rul' i than grapes. Our
planting Is Insignificant beside them.
Look at the fruit planting in Italy.
Olives, 1,034,000 hectares: wine grapes
3,462,000 hectares; chestnuts, 412,000 hec
tares ; in all 12,270,000 acres.
Consider. Spain. Of the 79.65 per cent
of productive land 3.7 per cent is de
voted to vineyards; 1.6 to olive culture,
and 20.8 to other fruits. Spain exports
large quantities of oranges, raisins,
grapes, nuts, olives ancl wines. Of wine

has sent to the capital of the
nation Mr. S. \V. Wall, a well
known, trained and reliable
newspaper writer, who will in
future have charge of The CalKs
news bureau in that city, with
headquarters at the Hotel Bar
ton. Mr. Wall has for a score
of years been n resident of Pa
cific Coast States, ami is there
fore competent to keep the peo
ple of the Far West advisctl In
all matters that have bearing on'
mercantile, ''agricultural and
minins: interests. He will de
vote attention especiaUfr to news
of department matt<4rs and of
legislnt ion affecting the States
and Territories of the" Pacific
slope.
Mr. Wall Is a lucid and force
ful writer aii'tl one of the best of
the newspaper correspondents of
this country. Ills first achieve
ments In the field of journalism,
when he wns one of the staff of
the Pittsburg Dispatch, brought
him into prominence, and his
fame was fnrther accentuated
in later years when he accom
panied the late George Francis
Train in the latter's first record
breaking trip from Pujret Sound
mound the. world. His latest
conspicuous effort was .Ills trip

It was the first year or the great
Alaskan gold field excitement,
and when the correspondents,
who had been sent to Dawson
via Bering Sea, reached the Yu
kon, they fonnd the river closed
to steamer navigation. The cor
resi>ondents, excepting Wall,
turned back, fearing to risk the
rigors of an Arctic winter. Wall
was undaunted. He purchased
a rowboat, hired guides and
poled up the turbid Yukon. It
took many days and the endur
ing of severe hardships to ac
complish the task, but Wall got
to Dawson Just as the river
turned to ice. He was the only
one of the newspaper corre

ADVISING SETTLERS.
To the intending settler in California
I unhesitatingly say conr- and Join the
noble army of fruit growers and be not
afraid of overproduction. Buy twenty
to forty acres of good land (and you
can get it In the Sacramento Valley
and San Joaqiiin Valley and many oth
er places In Northern -rid Central Cali
fornia for $25 to $75 per acre); plant
part to fruit trees, after carefully
studying your soil an- the varieties
best adapted to it; plant some alfalfa;
raise your chickens; keep a cow or t " ,>
and a few hots;. have a family garden;
produce as near as possible what you
require for home consumption; do your
work with the help of your family and
don't be afraid to tarn wages on the
outside when you have "nothing to do
at home.-
In short, farm here with the sair.3 in
dustry you did back East and I can as
sure you not only a god -living, but
that you will have money to loan and
withal will experience the Joy of living
in the most delightful climate in the
world. At- this writing, January 24.
19.4, if you live in the Northwestc* .1
States you are fighting weather 20 to

Reform of Mining
Laws Rouses
Discord.
natural water sheds are suggested as
the reÂ»l dividing lines.
Senator Nelson's bill providing for
the election of a representative is
specially objected to, as it fixes the
date of the election in summer, when
everybody is too busy to vote. "No
man at that time would think of tak- #
ing a day off for the purpose of vot
ing, as nearly every man who votes
would have to," said a well posted
Alaska miner discussing this bill.
"Besides, In the summer." he said, "the
country is overrun with transients
who are not entitled to but who would
vote."
Another of Senator Nelson's bills
addresses itself to curbing the license
of the city council at Nome. The
council has heretofore fixed salaries
at their pleasure; for Instance, putting
them up. away up, when the official
did things, lawful or unlawful, as they
indicated they wished them done, cut
ting them down when he showed a
disposition to go his way, even though
that way be the enforcement of law.
The bill allows the council to fix sal
aries of the Mayor and other officials,
but being fixed, not to change it dur
ing their term of office. The time of
all local elections is changed in this
bill from April to July.
According to another bill of Nel
son's all taxes and license money col
lected outside of incorporated towns
goes into a special Alaskan fund. 25
per cent of which if needed may be
used for school purposes outside the
towns. 10 per cent if needed may pro
vide for Insane and destitute and the
remainder shall go toward the build
ing of roads and bridges. A board
composed of the military is named to
look to the building of roads.
MAY DENY GA3IBLING.
Another bill prohibits gambling and
the employment of women In saloons,
provides a fine and forfeiture of li
cense upon conviction of either or of
allowing women to "rustle" in saloons.
Another Nelson bill provides for
the erection of a free bridsre over the
Snake River within the city limits of
Nome.
Senator Dillingham has introduced
a bill suspending indefinitely the right
of the North American Commercial
Company, lessees of the Pribilof group
of islands, to kill fur seals on or near
these islands and providing for the
opening of negotiations with Great
Britain looking toward a revision of
the laws governing the taking of seals.
The President Is required to negotiate
with the Governments of Russia and
Japan to the end that they be led to
subscribe to any agreement that may
be reached between the United States
and Great Britain. In case no such
agreement can be reached then the
Secretary of Commerce and Labor
may, by the bill, with the approval of
the President, reduce the surplus fe
male fur-seal life on the Pribilof Isl
ands by killing the same down to a
minimum number of not less than
10,000 adult female seals and the male
to not less than 1000 virile adult
males, the skins to be sold and the
money turned Into the treasury.
NEW GOVERNMENT WANTED.
Finally there is the expected bill
providing for a territorial form of
government in Alaska. It Is offered
by Jones of Washington. It may be
said that among the Alaskans now in
Washington there is not much enthu
siasm over this bill. It is pointed out
that the- big district Is in no condition
to support a cumbersome form ot
government, that its taxable propertv
could not pay the expense and that
for many other reasons it Is not ready
â Us immense distances, with Inade
quate means of communication, the
difficulty of holding elections, .etc..
make the territorial idea impractica
ble. The Senate committee has re
ported against such a measure.
This reviews the Alaskan legislation
as proposed to date. There will be
much more to follow. If any of It ever
gets into the law books, it will prob
ably be through much tribulation. But
whether or no this much may be pre
dicted that through the discussion In
cident the East may come at last Into
the knowledge that Alaska, with Us
Immense area, vast resources and un
limited opportunities, is on the map.
Among the prominent Alaskans in
the city looking after legislation on
their private interests are Francis Mc-
Nulty, Nome lawyer, who seeks the
place of Colonel Grisby as District At
torney at Nome; "Tim" Galen. Deputy
Marshal at Nome, who is a brotner-ln
law of Senator Carter: John Rustgard.
formerly Mayor of Nome; C. P. Dam.

Publishes New Law Volumes.
Thomas Carl Spelling, the well-known
attorney, has just issued two volumes
entitled "A Treatise on New Trial ana
Appellate Practice," which work 'is
likely to be of great value In legal cir
cles. The treatise presents and illus
trates the laws and rules of practice
in proceedings subsequent to decis
ions by trial courts. Including final dis
position In the Appellate Court, with
special reference to the codes of Cali
fornia and the Pacific Coast and West
ern States. The careful analysis and
systematic arrangements of the decis
ions bearing on new trials and appeals
is sure to be appreciated by the legal
profession.
Tries to Strangle Mother.
. Herman Hasse, a laborer, living at
524 Clxth street, tried to jump out of a
three-story window at his home short
ly after midnight yesterday morning
while temporarily insane, and when his
mother struggled with him to prevent
him carrying out his intention ha
grabbed her by the throat and at
tempted to strangle her. Policeman
Hammond heard her screams and res
cued her. Hasse was sent to the de
tention ward at the Central Emergency
Hospital to be exa-nlned by the Insan
ity Commissioners.

The Negro In the South.
"With the elevation, of the negrro, now
progressing: as the statistics show, there
is no E3od reason to doubt that in time
he villl rise to the full measure qf his
merit and that this will find , its best
recognition in the South, where now
in all ths highest branches of trade
and mechanical pursuit he has a status
denied him Jn the North. In the solu
tion of such a great problem as con
fronts the South lime Is essential, and
under the wise direction of such leaders
ea Booker T. Washington there is more
hope for good results than in all the
abstract dreams of the Northern phil
anthropists, who are equally ignorant
of- {hi* Southern negro and the South

down to the r.ipht clerk and" she
promptly followed his advice. Her anx

persuaded her to leave the hotel and
as she was departing she turned to the

off at 2:40 p. m., C. W. Irish beir.i? tbe I
referee. After some back and forth i
play, in which the Albion Rovers held !
their own, the Vampires obtaitied a cor- j
cer kick, from which L<>ps planted the j
ball right in front of goal, another of j
the forwards putting it between the
posts. Toward the end of the first <
period the Vampire forward kicked the |
ball into the month of the goal, but I
Hosford saved it. A second kick re- j i
pulled in a goal. The first period end- ;
ed. Vampires 2 goals. Albion Rovers 0. I
Early in the second period the Albion i
Kt/vers scored a goal from a long kick |
dowa the fi^Jd, Alrth making a poor ef
fort to save. The Vampires put the
ball icto the net a third time. In the
latler part of the second period John,
captain of the Albion Rovers, who, in
company with Gillchrest, had been
playing an excellent- game at back,
went into the forward line, Duquesne
taking the position vf left back.
The Albion Rovers were unable to
score again and the match ended 3
goals to 1 in favor of the Vampires. A
large number of spectators watched
the game and frequently applauded !
the good play. The grass <,n the field |
was long and po slippery that the play
ers fell frequently. The Albion Rov
ers played their regular team, but the
Vampires had a new man as outside
right, who acquitted himself well. For
the losers Duquesne. Bradley, Mathie
son and the two fullbacks rendered ex
cellent service. The teams lined up "as

win despite a rather weak line-up and
their defeat was a great surprise. â  â¢
The California Club won four out of
the flret six matches p!aye<1, Â»vhich
stamps them as having the class. The
Golden Gate Cub took the last three
matches.
The surprise of thÂ« day was the de
feat of Dr. HHI and Dr, McChesney,
the California Club's third team. Carl
la-dner was substituted for C. Foley
and with Clarence GrifUn for a partner
just managed to win ov*~ The medical
men won thel flrsL set handily and led
a'l the way in the second. The last
iwo sets were -dose.
Ray Cornell and Ray Splivalo, . the
California CIub'.s seventh team, tossed
off the club's best chance uf winning
tne odd match. They, led at 5-3 in the

CLEVER HOUND
IS MOUNT ROSE
â¢ Â«
Outpoints the 'Game Haphazard
an Exciting Run Over
Mie 'Field at Union Park
SHORTENDTSRS DO WELL
Flora Belle Drops From Sheer
Exhaustion at [the Conclusion
of a Long, Exciting Course
It was the greyhound Mount Rose
which triumphed at Union CourBlng
.Park yesterday afternoon, after a
great deciding course with Haphazard.
The spectators were on their toes while
theÂ© two game hounds tore all around
the field. The trial was a sensational
one, and all admitted" that. the better
courser carried off the glory.
The fine weather brought out a large
crowd. Betting was lively and the
shortenders had another good day. In
all, twenty-foijr- of- these won out of
a total of sixty-four entered. The up
sets kept happening right along, and
the wise contingent "was kept thinking
from *he time the first two dogs were
slipped until all was over.
Ths first course of the fifth round, In
wnich Mount Rose defeated Flora
Belle, was an exciting one. The lat
ter ran a great trial and, as her op
ponent succeeded in killing the hare,
she fell exhausted on the field. When
the deciding course came around,
Mount Rose ruled favorite, 4 to 1 over
Haphazard. !
The latter had many admirers and,
therefore, the betting took a lively
turn. When the hounds were slipped,
M(-\int Rose led to the hare by throe
lengths and made a couple, of turns.
Tihen Haphazard got into the going and
made it lively for a while. Mount Rose
8nov*?d speed all the time and never lot
up^ finally killing the hare, after a run
all over the field. Following are the re

Hampton Is champion of the coast
andÂ° Bonnet is an ex-cha*mpion.
;Neither of the champions was in condi
tion and did> not -^*lay. up to old-time
iprm. Corey and Cunningham were
on edge and: played with dash. The
first game wao close. Neither side
couRl score a point unless by killing
and the spectators vwre enthusiastic.
Corey began to throw in a hot serve
and neither Bonnet nor Hampton
could connect with the fast ball. The
youngsters captured, the first and sec
ond games. . Hampton and Bonnel
played harder and;won the thirfi and
fourth, ; but the youths would not' be
denied and took; the fifth game and
rubber*by '.a. score of 21 to 10. . : >Y.',
Hampton's right shoulder bothers
him. 'A'teiftlon is strained and he can
not tend in the ball as In the past. He
could, not "kill'.'? the. ball, \although
to had niany chances to do so. Hamp
ton will consult a physician to-day and
will have tbe muscles treated by elec
tricity. Bonnet, plays iji his usual
graceful way," but' owing to excessive
yeight is not .is fast as,he was some
years ago. Corey is the coming cham
pion of the coast. He has speed an*
strength and directs the ball with
great skill. Cunningham did some
clever work during the contest and
was highly 'torn mended for his clever
playing.' â¢
On Wednesday night Corey ana
Louis Levy, will play Joe Condon and
Tom Mahoney of the Occidental Cfaib

Raoul-Duval.^E. E2ra.
- Referee, Charles Dunphy; timekeeper, J. O.
Tobin. : o i
The Whites won ultimately by a score
of toup go c als to two. The Reds started
well, getting one of their goals in the
first period. Neither side scored in tha
second period.
In theo third F. JV Carolan scored for
the Whites, after a few moments of
play. His side scored again before the
end of, the period. 'Ezra evened the
score In o the fourth period, moving the
ball down the field in a desperate gal
loping match svlth Mr. Carolan. The
spectator^ were y-eated to another ex
citing struggled the same period, Tom
Driscoll and R. M. Tpbin haying a bat

horsemen. .= *. a <f>

THE- SAN tRA'NCISCO CALL. MONDAY. FEBRUARY 1,3904.
APAN'S RAPID
WORK IN NAVAL
CONSTRUCTION
Japan Is doing some rapid work 'In
shipbuilding. A cruiser, named Otava.
was begun at tho.Yokosuko dockyard
January 6, 1903, and launched Ilovcm
l.r 6 and la to be ready 'for service
during the present year. The Otava is
of 3000 tons, 10,000 horsepower, 21 knots
speed and 340 feet length, 41 feet S
inches breadth and 16 feet *5 inches
draught. The armament consists of
two e 6-Inch, six 4.7tinch, fmir 12-pound-^
ers and two machine guns. The rapid-*
ity with, which this vessel has 'been
built exceeds that of the builders 0 ih
Great Britain, who have four scouts of
2610 to 2900 tons contracted for.; aver
a year ago - and nene of, , . them are
launched./ .'Â¦':Â¦' ."Â¦ "' Â¦Â¦""Â¦ ' Â¦"'Â¦ Â¦_Â¦ "';â¢ â .""'
Two cruisers oT . 3420 tons, â¢ 10,00.$
ho^epower and 20 knots speed are
building "at. Yokosuko atfd.Kure dock- c
yards. They art; named; Niitaka. and
Tsushima and carry batteries of six 6
inc}i,' - ten . 12-pounders an* .'.- four-.. 2Vz
pounders." The Niitalta was launched
last November. at Yokosulo and efforts
are made to have both vessels" eomplet-.
ed at an early Mate. Â¦ At the two yards
named there are also under construc
tion one gunboat of 620 tons, four 329-,
ton destroyers of 31 knots -. and nine
torpedo boats of 120 to 150 tens and
28 knots speed. - Most of the material
used in the construction of these ve3- 0
sels is of British manufacture, but the
completion of the steel railing plank
and armor factory near ~ Kure , will
make Japan independent 3 of , foreign
material and . with .the . c^erlence
gained in the construction ; of ; smaller
craft will not alone -be competent to
buHd battleships and -torpedo 5 crafts
for Its own useÂ»but may become a for*
mtdable competitor for navy and mer
cantile work for foreign countries.
, ThÂ« Russian Black Sea <Â¦ fleet is of
little value, IV consists of eight battle
thins ranging from *0"6 tons to 12.4SO
tons, and -built between 1886 and 1902.
Only two. the Tria Sviatelia .and
Kniaz PotemklU Tavritchesky, are of
modern construction,; the older ships
are in various, stages of decrepitude,
Â«.f slow speed, insufficient protection
and obselete armament. Two armor
ed cruisers are under construction,
and seven cruisers built in .1880-87 are
only lit for inland water service. In
addition there are three old giKiboatSt
six destroyers under construction and
.thirty-Uvo torpedo boats, mos,t of
which are less than SO tons.. The liber
ation of the Russian Black Sea fleet
would be of little, benefit as an (Addi
tion* to the Russian fleet in the Par
East, .the available continge/it sim
mers down from Â°fiftyÂ»nine. vessels, to
Uvo battleships, o and there is 0 3ome
doubt abÂ°out the latters' abjlity. as tne
dockyard administration in the Black
Sea has" .been notorious for its cÂ«rrun
tion and insufficiency. . ". . â¢
VSBSUBgS naval station .
Over, one and a half million dollars
were wasted" in the selection of Port
Royal as a naval, station. where" after
building a dock and ejecting a number
of shops am? officers" residences, it was
foujnd that ships oould n!>t be # docked.
The station lies been abandoned in so.
Car -s regards its original purpose,
btlt H still required five oflftws and an
expenditure Â«f . $142,797 .last -year to
maintain Ihe^mud navql statin. The
sits was selected" in 1889" by a board
of .naval office^. Two years ago a
floating Â«Kteel dockÂ°A\as located* in. the
Mississippi .at Algiers, near New" Or
leans, this site having been seipeted,
upon 'Â¦ the recommendation of a board
Qf line officers of the jpavy. . The dock
was bultt at a cost of $850,000, and the
bat\leÂ»hip Illinois was successfully
docked in January, 1902. Since then-no
other vessel has :Lpoh raised on that
dock aÂ»d At is apparent that Algiers
.is but a' repetition of the Port Royal
blunder.'" 3 The dock, cannot be utilized
owing to theÂ° filling up with mud and
flriftwoud of the* basin in which the
dock lies. Four naval officers, drawing
$20,797 were attached to this Nation
last year an* itÂ» tota.1 cost of main
tenance was $133,239.
* Chief Constructor W. L,. Capps was
before the House o Naval '.Committee : n
few days ago and inade this statement^
"1 think it's desirable not to under
take additional construction of large
vesse/s in the navy yards just at piv
erft. My i rason for this' is that it is
desirable to fit out our principal yards
more completely than they o are at the
present time before undertaking addi
tional shipbuilding on a .large scale.
â¢ â¢ â¢ With the exception of the two
principal yards on the Atlantic Coast
and "lie cd the Pacific Coast, all of our
navy yards are in a somewhat transi
tory /state." It would be interesting
and instructive to learn how much
more money is required to fit the thrae
navy yÂ«rds referred to in order to
undertake shipbuilding on a larger
scale. The Maine and Cincinnati were
built at he New York navy yard, and
the, Texas and Raleigh at the Norfolk
; navy 0 yard, during the years 18!$-1S92.
The time elapsed between laying of the
keel and launching was 762 days for the
Maine. 1Q44 days for the Cincinnati, 1121
days for the foxas and 853 days for the
Raleigh- At that time the yards were
not at all prepared to undertake ship
building, and the work and expense it
Installing modern machine tools and
other labor-Â»-a%'ii.g appliances went on
simultaneously with ' the construction
of the ships. The disadvantages were
further increased through . lack a?
skilled mechanics, nevertheless, the
time compares favorably with that of
battleships built in private yards, the
corresponding period in days being:
For the Indiana, 663: Massachusetts,
715; Oregon. 707, and Iowa 966. These
ehfps Â»vere built in 1890-92 at yards well
equipped with modern tools and gangs
of skilled workmen. ,
OUR NAVY YARDS PLANTS.
Since then the New York, Norfolk
and Mare Island navy yards have re

chinery plants, and obsolete tools have
been thrown on the scrap-iron pile. Ac
cording to the latest report of the pay
master general, the Value of the ma
chinery plants at these three navy
yards is: For New York, $2,124,726;
for Norfolk. $1,105,772, and for Mare
Island, $984,522. There are no private
yards in which the machinery: plant
foots up to such an amount, f and yet
they are capable, In most instances, of
building ' several armored ships be
sides undertaking mercantile ship
building and carrying on repairs.
More men are profitably employed on
a smaller capital invested in plants in
private yards "than in navy yards,
which goes to indicate that other
methods, rather than additional facil
ities, are needed in order to make the
navy yards fit for economical, rapid
and good work'. *
Rear Admiral Henry C. Taylor, chief
of the Bureau <rf Navigation, has pre
sented a tabular statement to Congress
showing that there will be a ; shortage
of 797 officers in June, 1907. . Captain W.
H. Brownson,' superintendent of the
Naval Academy, on the other hand, ex
presses the opinion that there will be
no 1 deficit, as a sufficient number will
graduate during the - next three years
to supply the requisite junior officers.
When naval experts disagree on such
a simple ; proposition it . becomes some

In tgme \ofo peace. Thirty-four vessel*
hav"e been ordered during the past year,
of which' three battleships, 9tamed re
spectively Britannia, oHibernia an$
Africa, are being built in dockyards.
They are of aa improved King Edward
VII type, of 16,350 ton* ajid 18.5 knots
speed, cpour armored craisers of the
Duke of Edinburgh class have been
named Warrior,. 0 Achilles, Natal and
Cochrane,' the Warrior being built at
Pembroke dockyard, the other three by
contract. Those armored cruisers are
of 13,550 tons and twenty- two knots
spee.tf. Four scouts of twenty-five knots
speed have been contracted for and
named' Attentive, Skirmisher, Fore
sight and Patrol. Four vessels of thJs
clas?.*are approaching completion. and
the Guilders were given a free hand to
produce â¢ vessels on ifiejt own design
that would make the required speed of
twenty-flv& kne-ts. A like Rfovision
has been made in the four* new scduts,
thÂ» displacements of which range from
2600 to 2700 tons. Ten submarine. boats
are being built by the. Vickers firm, at
Barrow, and contracts for thirteen tor
pedo-boats of .25% k.nots sveed and
about 540 tons displacement have been
placed with five of the foremost firms
whose work in that line has given ,the
best results in previous contracts. -'
BRITAIN' LIKES SUBMARINES.
The British Admiralty J has accepted
the submarine boat as an element in
warfare, and decided 'to build twenty
seven more of the crafts, bringing the
â  total up to forty-six, within the next
.twelve months. These boats have rap
idly grown in favor in the Brit'ih navy
and proved their value since their in^
jtroduction only thres years ago. Vickers.
Sons & Maxim, at Barrows, induced
the Admiralty in 1901 to purchase, the
plans of John Holland, on which eight
boats were being built for the United
States navy, and contracts were given
out for a first lot of five soon after, fol
lowed with an. order for four more. The
boats were : .within nine
; months and have undergone exhaustive
trials, In. which their merits have been
demonstrated, ; and such defects as ex
isted in earlier boats have been: reme
died in subsequent .. construction. * The
programme for 1903-04 provided for ten
boats- of ; increased - sire, ' and contracts
for nine : have -'been : given to â  Barrow;s
and*' will be ready , for launching .in
March next. The designs for the tenth
beat: have. been- held back with- a; view
of : further improving' the type of fu
ture.'boats. The Admiralty hpw.proposes
to "â  build a flotilla- of ; twenty-seven in
batches of, nine at a\ time, and the,Bar
row, company is : busy^completing : the
boats , on hand- and â¢ preparing", for â¢ new

3 o'clock yesterday morninjf by shoot
ing herself in the left breast. She was
employed in a dance hall at 409 Pacific

Prank "Warren, a watchman employed
by the Morse agency, notlSed Police
man T. C. Murphy that the woman had
shot herself. Murphy hurried to heir
room and found her sitting jn a chair.
He asked her wht> had shot her and
she said that while Warren was asleep
on a cheir she took his revolver out of
his pocket and shot herself. She re
fused to give any reason for her act.
She was sent to the Central Emergency
Hospital.
Sam Barber, a friepd of Warren, was
