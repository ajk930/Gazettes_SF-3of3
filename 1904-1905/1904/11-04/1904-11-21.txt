ROME, Nov. 20. â Demonstrations
of protest against the Innsbruck af

places in Italy. In Rome the students
again started in the direction of the
Austrian embassy and soon were aug
mented in numbers on the streets.
The Dollce .were insufficient to control
the demonstration. When the crowds
arrived at -the embassy they shouted
"Long live Trent" and "Long live
Trieste." The troops that had been
called out charged the mob and dis
persed it.

by municipalities and addresses to the
Government, one of. which - from
Naples bore 6000 signatures.

I At the meeting Premier Tizsa, in a
vigorous speech, ridiculed the charge
that a breach of the constitution had
been committed and said that the na
tion must decide whether Parliament
was to be ruined by factions of the mi
nority.
The situation is regarded as critical.
'Out of a total of 400 members, 160 mem
bers of the opposition parties ' have
united against the Government, whose
party has been weakened by the loss of
the aristocratic group under Count An.
drassy. The press is equally divided
for and against Premier Tizsa and his
enemies are actively at
court in the hope of influencing the
King against him.
A memorial of the united opposition
demanding of the King the dismissal
of Premier Tizsa on account of his
measures to defeat . obstruction has
been drawn up by Count Apponyi and
signed by Francis Kossuth, Baron
Banffy, Count Zichy, Deputy Ugron
and other leaders, representing, all sec

tone it accuses Premier Tizsa of violat

threatens the King with a conflict of
incalculable dimensions If he , breaks
his oath by sanctioning: laws passed
under summary procedure.

WHITTIER. Nov. 20.â The athletic

ber of 'the girls' basket ball team at
the Whittier High School to-night en
abled Miss Mattie Hall to win. a des
perate fight with a masked burglar in
her room and to be the means of caus
ing his arrest.
Miss Hall is only fifteen years of age,
and last night her parents left her and
her sister, aged 9, at home while they
went to spend the night with a rela
tive., A' noise in their room awoke
Mattie about 2 o'clock this morning,
and her first glance around the room
revealed the outlines of a man's form
passing out the door.
Pluckily, the girl decided to do some
investigating. She arose, locked the
door and quickly dressed. She then
attempted to open the door to step out
into the hall, but found that it was
being held by some one outside the
room. Just as, she stepped back from
the door," it was forcibly thrown open
and a masked man stepped into the
room and viciously attacked her. She
began calling for help and at the same
time, tried to throw the man to the
floor.
, He endeavored to grasp her throat,
but she struck him several telling
blows, one : of which almost downed
him. By. this time her sister had
opened a window and began screaming
for help, and the burglar, hearing
other persons approaching, ran from
the house. â¢ Officers tracked him by
the' imprints of his tennis shoes a few
blocks away and found a young man
named Gunn In bed with his clothes
on and bearing abundant marks of a
recent struggle.
Gunn is in Jail and Miss Hall says
she thinks he is her assailant. .

"Oh!" the agent promised. "It will
all be done before the month is out."
The tenants- were obdurate, how

all. They renewed their agreement to
stand together and move out in a

the stork had not dropped in on tho

The call of the bird mads it de

but they say they will renew the strike
next month, unless the promised im

ing wedding of Count Cini of Rome,
Italy, grand nephew of the late Pope
Leo, to Miss Elizabeth Howe of Pitts
burg, has been again' announced. It
will take place in London in the spring.
The wedding was announced some time
ago, but for some reason not then ex

understood.
It is now a certainty, â¢ and social
Plttsburg is at present discussing the
announcement that the demands made
by the Count have been* met by Miss
Howe, who has agreed to defray all the
Count's debts, providing they do not
total more than $50,000, and guarantees
him $10,000 yearly for life. Until this
was done the Count did not enthuse
over the wedding arrangements.
After the wedding had been. first an
nounced the Count demanded that he
be given $70,000 in hand to settle out
standing obligations and $15,000 annu
ally for life. He was refused and fled
to Canada, whence he sent a revised
bill, making it $50,000 cash and $10,000
yearly. This was accepted.
Miss Howe, who is 40 years of age,
is much the older of the pair.
TACOMA, Nov. 20.â Shen Hsi Shui,
a wealthy Chinese of Shanghai, who
arrived here several days ago on the
steamship Tremont, is being held at

CHICAGO, Nov. 20.â Dramatic and
mysterious circumstances surround
the suicide of Miss Elsie Gesterling by
drinking poison in the Vendome Hotel
here yesterday. Grief over the sudden
death of the man she was to have mar
ried next Saturday is the only known
cause for her act. She left no note
that would give a clew- At the hotel
it was stated that her fiance was Her
man Parker, a prominent railroad offi
cial residing in Cincinnati. He died
suddenly on Wednesday, it was said.
A. E. Frost, proprietor Qf the hotel,
said her betrothed, Mr. Parker, was
buried In St. Louis yesterday, and de
clared it as his belief that Miss Ges
terling committed suicide so that she
might die at the hour of the funeral.
At this point the mystery begins.
No Herman Parker died in Cincinnati.
No Herman Parker was buried In St.
Louis yesterday. No Herman Parker
occupied a prominent position in the
railroad world. But â
Charles A. Parker died "suddenly"
In Cincinnati. Charles A. Parker was
buried in St. Louis yesterday. Charles
A. Parker was first vice president of
the Cincinnati, Hamilton .and Dayton
Railroad, and President of thÂ« Pierre
"Marquette Railroad. :Par
ker knew Miss Gesterling in Denver,
and: it was from that city that she
came to Chicago- . .... ...
When' the news of Miss Gesterling*a
suicide reached Cincinnati the belief
was expressed that C. A. Parker had
taken his own life. There were sus
picious circumstances connected with
his sudden death, but all talk of self
destruction was at first hushed, be
cause there was no apparent motive
for the act. His friends, though in
sisting that death was due to natural
causes, said that he- had been melan
choly for some days, but attributed that
to worry about his position.
A possible motive was supplied yes
terday by the despairing young woman
in the Vendome Hotel, if the sequel
shall prove that the lives-of this man
and this girl had been so fatefully
merged. For Mr. Parker was a mar
ried man.
Miss Gesterling and her mother came
to Chicago from Denver two months
ago. The young woman was 23 years
of age, the only daughter of a widow,
and possessed of Independent means.
According to reports received from
Denver to-night Miss Gesterling led
rather a gay life in that city. The
theory is advanced in Denver that the
sudden death of Charles A. Parker and
the suicide of Miss Gesterling were the
fruits of a death compact between the
two.
. When the Territorial Grand Jury
adjourned November 12 committees
were appointed to investigate the vari
ous county offices and particularly the
circumstances connected with the al
leged robbery. Many circumstances
did not harmonize with the story told
by Storm, one In particular causing
doubt, in which he claimed he had
kicked on the door of the vault at in
terval* all night to attract attention.
When his bondsmen were making an
investigation they placed one of their
number in the vault and locked it and
had him kick on the door. The noise
made by, him attracted the attention
of people on the opposite side of the
plaza. : '-: .
. Another circumstance that Storm
was , unable to explain j to the satisfac
tion' of : the; jury was why he^had left
the, vault and safe open and the money
exposed . on .< a' holiday". ' particularly as
-a, 'monthly settlement
With/Uhe Board of Supervisors "on the
preceding- day. These and minor cir
cumstances aroused- suspicion.
; A "large /number of witnesses were
examined - by the Grand Jury's com
mittee; The" committee concluded its
investigation late last night and dis
covered that an alleged shortage had
existed in the office for some time and
a complaint was immediately sworn
to charging Storm with embezzlement
and a warrant was issued for his ar
rest. An officer found Storm at 1
o'clock this morning taking supper at
a restaurant with a number of friends
and he was taken to jail.
Pending final action in the case by
the Grand Jury, which reconvenes to
morrow, bonds were fixed at $20,000.
Storm a stock raiser and
rancher before his election to office
in' 1900 and had always borne a good
reputation and was very popular.
Late this evening a bond was of
fered aggregating $25,000, but was re
jected by the District Attorney on ac
count of not being in legal" form.
Storm's friends claim he will be able
to furnish bonds to-morrow.
PRESCOTT, Ariz., Nov. 20. â James
P. Storm, former County Treasurer of
Yavapai County, who was found
bound and gagged in the vault of his
office on November 9 and who re
ported that he had been robbed of
$15,000 by two men and then placed
irÂ» the vault in the condition found
and where he claimed he. had been
for seventeen hours, was arrested this
morning and charged with embezzle
ment.
BUTTE, Mont, Nov. 20.â The famous
ten million dollar Minnie Healy mine.
operated by F. Augustus Heinze, was
to-day closed by an injunction issued
by Judge Clancy at the instance of the
Amalgamated Company. The shut
down throws out of employment nearly
1000 miners, smeltermen and other la
borers.
It is for the possession of this prop
erty that Heinze and the Amalgamated
Copper Company have waged one of
the most bitter and sensational legal
fights In the history of the United
States. The mine was first awarded to
Heinze by Judge Harney. but the State
Supreme Court remanded the case to
Judge Clancy. During the second trial
the Ada Brackett scandal arose and
the alleged efforts to bribe Judge Har
ney with $250,000 by amalgamated men
were brought to light.
Judge Clancy finally awarded the
property to Heinze. An appeal was
again taken and a decision shortly 13
expected from the State Supreme
Court.
By an order of the lower court Heinza
was allowed to work the property,
which has been in full operation until
to-day's shut down.
To-day's Injunction was granted on
allegations- made by the Amalgamated
Company â¢ that. Heinz a was , using the
Minnie Hea!y as a means of looting 1
adjoining property, which belongs to
that company.
P. Augustus Heinze attempted to
thrash Constable Fitzgibbons when tho
latter served the enjoining order. Only
the interference of some of Heinze'3
friends prevented a mix-up between
the United Copper Company's presi
dent and the officer. Heinze flew into
a rage, threw Judgs Clancy's papers
at the constable and slapped his face.
Prior to the assembling of the va
rious fusion forces of Silver Bow
County in convention previous to the
late election. .fudge William Clancy
was known as the foremost of the
so-called. Heinze judges, enjoying, it. is
said, the intimate confidence of
Heinze. An indiscreet admission by
Clancy that he knew that the sale of
Helnze's mining interests to the
Amalgamated Company was about to
be consummated endangered Heinze's
chance of carrying the county, and in
retaliation Heinze defeated Judge
Clancy for a renomination for Dis
trict Judge. County Attorney Peter
Breen was nominated. Clancy in
wrath quit the convention hall im
mediately after the announcement of
Breen's nomination. Both of Heinze's
candidates for judgeshipa were beaten.
The Minnie Healy Injunction fol
lows a suit for $5,000,000 against
Heinze for ore alleged to have been
looted from Amalgamated mines.
SALT LAKE, Nov. 20.â Judge O. W.
Powers of Salt Lake came to his of
fice the morning after the election to
learn he had been defeated for . Con
gress. On his desk he found a letter
conveying to. him mining stock worth
$10,000, a Congressman's salary for two
years, from "Dlamondfield Jack" Davis,
whose death warrant was drawn by
Powers in Idaho in 1898. \. -.
"Dlamondfield Jack," then known as
a desperado, gun-fighting cowboy, was
convicted of having murdered two sheep
herdera in Idaho in 1896. The killings
followed a long war between the sheep
men and cattlemen for possession of a
range in the . Shoshone Basin. Davis
had been In numerous scrimmages. with
the sheepmen and had threatened to
kill the next sheepman he found on the
disputed ground. When the bodies
were found suspicion at once pointed to
Davis. He fled, but was later arrested
at the Arizona penitentiary in Tuma.
Governor Sparks of Nevada, by whom
Davis had been employed, spent a large
sum of money, said to be not less than
$20,000, In defending Davis. The sheep
men employed Powers, a noted criminal

contestants were hardly ten feet apart
Miller shot from 3. 41-caliber English
bulldog, while the policeman used a
SS-caliber revolver. When the fusil
lade had ended both weapons were
emptied, though neither combatant
was aware of this fact. A chase fol
lowed and Miller was taken prisoner
r.Lout two blocks from where it start
ed. He threw away his pistol and
accompanied the policeman to head
quarters, where he maintained a
stoical attitude until Captain of De
tectives Joseph Burnett quickly recog
nized him as an old offender and con
fronted him with his previous rec
ord. Then he admitted his identity
and said that, since 1SE2. most of his
life had been spent within the. con
fines of prisons.
DEMANDS MOXET.
Malone was going home from his
Â¦work and was approaching Chestnut
etreet. on Webster, when a masked
man suddenly stepped in front of him.
Without hesitation the highwayman
presented a pistol and ordered him
to hold up his hands. Malone was
not Quick in complying, but when the
command was repeated he realized
that he was face to face with a des
perate robber. The gas man also
heard footsteps behind him, and
Imagined that a second thug was com
ing to the assistance of the first, so
he made no resistance and, when
asked to. handed over a purse con
taining 57S 45. A short parley fol
iowed. the robber accusing him of
having more coin In his possession.
Then it was that O'Neil came upon
the scene.
O'Neil, who was off duty, had taken
his little boy for a walk down on the
c^L. a " d was returning to his home,
29^4 Vt ebster street. He had the little
fe.low by the hand and was but a short
distance behind Malone. He paid lit
tle heed to the latter's hesitation until
he came quite close and saw the gas
man with his arms raised and a masked
â¢ man standing behind him. The per
son whose face was concealed held a
pistol in one hand and was going
through his victim's pockets with the
other. Instantly O'Neil realized what
was happening. Still grasping his boy
by the hand he drew his revolver and
called upon the knight of the road to
throw up his hands. Miller, who, until
this time, was apparently unconsciouss
of the approach of the policeman
wheeled around suddenly and opened
fire.
WEAPONS ARE EMPTIED.
O'Neil lost no time In responding and
In a few seconds each party had ex
changed five shots apiece and the air
was tlense with smoke. Miller, slightly
wounded In the arm, started to run.
O'Xeil followed him. calling upon him
to halt and surrender. The crim
inal paid no heed and the chase
lasted two blocks until a small park
was reached. Here Miller stumbled on
Eome ground that had recently been
plowed and O'Xeil halted beside him.
O'Xeil pointed his pistol at the hold-up
man end ordered him to give himself
Into the hands of the law. Miller at
first paused, though his weapon was
rot raised, but finally cast It aside and
lifted his erms above his head.
Malone all through the chase had
kept close to the officer and when the
surrender was made he was at his
Eide. O'Xeil ordered Miller to stretch
out his arms and Malone, taking a pair
cf handcuf's from the policeman's
pocket, placed them upon the prisoner's
wrists. Miller was of the opinion that
there was one more shot left In the
policeman's revolver, and the officer
believed that Miller had reserved a bul
let for a final fight, there having only
been five shots fired from each weapon.
This accounts for the surrender with
out a struggle.
Miller did not look like a criminal
when he reached the central police sta
tion. He attempted to elicit sympathy
by saying that if he asked for a dollar
without displaying a pistol it would not
be given hhn, though he were starv
ing. He attempted to convey the Im
pression that poverty had forced him
to the commission of the crime. A
little later he was taken to the detec
tive bureau and questioned by Captain
Burnett. The chief of the detective
force quickly recognized him. Calling
for a book of records and pictures from
the rogues' gallery, he showed one to
the prisoner. Miller glanced at his
photograph and !n answer to a ques
tion stated that the police records con
tained all of his history-
The records of the department show
that Miller was cent from San Francis
co on June 7, 1S82, to San Quentln for
Holding: his three-year-old eon by

liceman John S. O'Neil fought a pistol
duel with and captured one of the
most dangerous highwaymen and
criminals that has looked from be

many months. The prisoner, George
Miller, already having served four
terms In penitentiaries, his face con
cealed behind a mask, was In the act
of holding: up and robbing Richard C.

he was discovered by O'Neil. The

h&ve been unusually quiet along the
Shakhe River. The fronts of General
Oku's army and the Russians have
b*en firing only occasional shots. The
armies have been lying entrenched
and practically in touch for more than
a month, but there have been only
cavalry and small infantry skirmishes.
The Japanese are virtually living in
the trenches and the army is standing

for the purpose.
Okn's Army Xot in Action.
So far as known there has been no
disaster to shipping. Owing to a mis
calculation in the day she was due to
arrive and a private message from As
toria that the Portland and San Fran
cisco steamer George W. Elder had ex
perienced a terrible trip, a report be
came widely circulated this afternoon
that the steamer had put in to Astoria
in a badly crippled condition. The El
der, however, arrived at her dock in
Portland two hours ahead of time and
reported no more serious mishap than
the bruising of several of the passen
gers who were unable to keep their
feet.
Notwithstanding the safe arrival of
the Elder there is considerable nervous
ness in marine circles concerning the
safety of several craft about due at
Astoria. Two schooners sighted Friday
have not been seen since. The wires to
nearly all coast points are either down
or. working badly and news will be
meager until the wind subsides. ' .
Locally the storm has been the cause
of a few minor accidents and a' good
deal of discomfort. Several . trees have
been uprooted and several houses In
course of construction have been, un
roofed, but further than this no dam
age has resulted.
PORTLAND, Nov. 20.â The unusually

TACOMA, Nov. 20. â George O'Mal

TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 20.â Torrents

Shipping men discredit the Victoria
report of the wrecking of the barken
tine Makaweli. She was loaded with
coal in Tacoma, taking about 1,700 tons
for Mazatlan, Mexico. The story from
Victoria about the barkentine being
overloaded with deck cargo of lumber
and turning turtle is probably untrue.
The Makaweli is well down in the
water with coal and the rough dimen
sion lumber which is being found along
the shores is certainly not from the
Makaweli.
The fact that a life buoy bearing the
barkentine's name has been carried
ashore is no proof that the ship has
gone to the bottom. While nothing has
been heard of the Makaweli since she
sailed from Tacoma, October 30. it is
possible that she may have been car
ried to the north in the high gales, but
the. finding of lumber shows that it is
some other vessel than the barkentine
which foundered.

ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 21, 4 a. in.â
The suspense engendered by the Japan
ese' attack on Putiloff Hill continues.
This movement has proved unsuccess
ful. It aimed merely to capture a Rus
sian position, but whether it was in
tended to mask activity at some other
point along the front has not yet de
veloped. Some correspondents note
what they consider significant Japan
ese movements on the Russian right,
and others that a Japanese column is
moving fifty or sixty miles eastward;
but the opinion in military circles
seem? to be that no great movement
is likely to occur before the fate of
Port Arthur is decided. At the same
time it is recalled here that General
Kuropatkln's great aggressive move
ment of test month was in full swing
a week before the outside world real
ized what was occurring.
MUKDEN, Nov. 20.â The Japanese
attack on Putiloff Hill has demon
strated the efficacy of the Russians'
defensive works. Two battalions en
gaged in the attack occupied the first
line of the Russian trenches, but. at the
second line were caught in pits and
entanglements and exposed to a galling
fire. A Russian bayonet attack com
pleted their demoralization.
The weather continues mild, with clear
nights, which are favorable to night

WASHINGTON. Nov. 20.â With Secre
tary Morton 'asking Congress to give
the navy J114.530.638 for Its expenses
in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1905,
it Is apparent that a fleet costing $100,
000,000 a year has come to stay. This
vast expenditure means that the policy
of naval expansion will go on until
the American navy is second only to
that of England In size and will re
main, as now, second to none in ship
to-ship efficiency. â¢ .
When all the American warships
now building are completed, the navy
will be the third largest in the world.
England and France -will be first and
second.
Tne sentimet't which causes the up
building of the navy was awakened
twenty years ago, when naval expendi
tures were small. Only $14,819,976 80
was appropriated by Congress in 1883.
The cost gradually increased until 1898,
when, with the Spanish-American war
In sight, it aggregated 533,003,234. The
expenditures in 1899 jumped to $56,098,
783 and since then, by leaps and
bounds, they have, increased, as ship
after ship has been added to the list.
The navy of January 1, 1906, upon
which the brunt of service would fall
in the event of war, will be: Battle
ships 12, armored cruisers 8, protected
cruisers 21. torpedo boat destroyers 16,
torpedo boats 35.
Not all of these ships are now in
commission. The moBt notable addi
tions will be the armored cruisers Col
orado, Pennsylvania. West Virginia
and South Dakota. No armored cruis
ers have been added to the fleet since
the Brooklyn and New York were put
Into commission more than ten years
ago.
After the second attack the Jap
anese, breaking up into small groups
began to retire. They were followed
by a well aimed tire, which continued
until dawn. Near the trenches eighty
Japanese corpses were found and
further along in the valley were vis
ible Japanese bodies which it was im
possible to gather in view of the Jap
anese fire. Four Japanese were made
prisoners and thirty rifles and a quan
tity of ammunition abandoned on the
field were taken by the Russians.
On the morning of November 18
Russian batteries bombarded Chan
linza, where Japanese entrenchments
were observed, and at 8 o'clock an
artillery engagement took place with
the Japanese forces. The Russian
losses were four killed and two
wounded. Judging from the number
of bodies seen and articles thrown
away by the Japanese it is supposed
the total loss to the Japanese was
several hundred.
FYNDIATION VILLAGE, Saturday,
Nov. 19. â On the night of November
17 four companies of unmounted vol
unteers were sent into the Japanese
positions. They reached Chanlinza,
where they were met with a heavy
rifle fire and forced to retire. At 3
o'clock in the morning the Russians
discovered a column of Japanese
creeping down a hill. They attacked
a prove forming a part of the Russian
foremost position on the right side.
The Japanese advanced without fir
ing and rushed the grove with hur
rahs, but in the face of the fire from
the Russian trenches they turned and
lied. After some time the Japanese
repeated the attack, but again were
repulsed.

The last act represents the Emperor's

gladiatorial contests take place and are
cut short by the impatient shouts of
the mob, clamoring for the young
Christian. The youth is at length led
forward. His speches to the Emperor
are interrupted by the mob, which
thirsts for his blood. Diocletian finally
gives the signal to admit the beasts,
and as he does so Pancratius. stretch
ing his arms in the form of a cross,
cries out, "Forgive them. Father, for
they know not what they do!" Then
the clang of falling bars is heard to
gether with the roar of a panther and
the lights go out.
For a few minutes the confused
shrieking of the multitude continues
and then there Is silence. A beam of
light from above discloses a mangled

In a quarrel between the two,' which
occurs after the debate, Pancratius, in
flamed with the ardor of youth, is
taunted into making a passionate con
fession of his faith. From the fatal
effects of his declaration he is only
saved by the act of his bosom friend,
Sebastian, captain of the Emperor's
guards, who appoints the youth to a
high army post at Campagna. Pan
cratius servelP in the army for four
years with great honor, in the mean
time living happily with his foster
parent, Dionyslus. Corvinus, however,
gains the prefect's chair on the death
of his father and immediately makes
use of his new power to force Pancra
tius to resign.
The young officer comes to Rome,
and. In the presence of the prefect's
court, he is offered half the wealth of
the city if he will but read aloud the
edict against the Christians. An in
tensely dramatic scene follows, in which
the youth, after apparently yielding,
suddenly rushes to the top of the
throne, tears the edict to fragments
and thunders forth the first command
ment. "I am the Lord, thy God. Thou
shalt not have false gods before me."
For this he is brought before the Em
peror Diocletian, and. in the banquet
hall of the palace, where almost one
hundred and fifty characters find repre
sentation, he is tried and sentenced to
death.
Angered at his. inability to conquer
the boy, Diocletian calls on his guards
to force Pancratius to his knees be
fore a statue of the god JTupiter. A
struggle follows and Pancratius cries
out for heavenly aid. Instantly a
blinding flash of light smashes the
statue to bits and leaves in Its place
a glittering eleqtrifl cross. Dlonysius,
accompanied by Sebastian, visits his
young ward in the prison and gives
him a small phial containing the blood
of his martyred father. The parting
between the three is very affecting.
Corvinus visits the prison and taunts
the young Christian, and a stormy
scene occurs between them.
The author is a young student of
the college, Martin V. Merle, who has
appeared in the public eye on several
occasions past, first as the stage direc
tor of the Passion Play and later as
the author of "The Prairie Judgment"
and "The Cardinal's Prisoner."
In brief the plot of the play is this:
Pancratius, a young Roman noble, se
cretly a Christian, wins the Emperor's
badge in a public speaking contest that
takes Dlace within the crowded walls
of the Colosseum. Thus he gaina the
admiration of all Rome and at the
same time the Jealous enimity of his
defeated opponent, Corvinus, son of the
prefect of the city.

The chief characteristic of Russia's exist

This condition has been intensified during re

Under the existing condition the Govern

for the people. But such action only makes
matters worse and leads to blunders and con

foster tutelage by centralizing power In the
hands of bureaucrats. The result Of thin Is es_

long as bureaucracy blocks the guarantee of
personal rights, thereby paralyzing the very
essence of individual initiative. The absence of
freedom of conscience, speech and pre9s are
prime factors In. the estrangement of rulers and
people.
Restrictions bear grievously upon classes as

free and independent administration of justice
as an essential safeguard against this con
stant encroachment upon the life and liberty
of the individual.
While the press is not at liberty to
give a detailed report 6f the speeches,
it is able to summarize the chief points
of the discussion preceding the adop
tion of the Zemstvo memorandum..
Reactionaries, of courseware" horri
fied at the mere suggestion of anything
approaching, a Parliament or a con
stitution. All their power and influ
ence already are In the scale; but
no matter which way the balance
swings, the decision is believed to
mark an epoch in Russia's history.
! The actual participants in the meet-
Ing here are far from hopeful, but they
sincerely believe the salvation of the
country depends on the solution they
have to offer, and have the satisfaction
of knowing that, as representatives of
the most authoritative provincial insti
tutions of the empire, they have for
once spoken out their views and taken
measures to have them spread before
ihe world, as well as the Government
which is addressed. For one result, it is
sure to give a tremendous Impetus to
the liberal movement; With the country
in the throes of a great and hitherto
unsuccessful foreign war and disturbed
conditions at home, the measure which
is aimed to rouse united action might
overrule other considerations.
Recently the Emperor has spoken
much of Witte's famous memorandum,
written just before his fall, on the ad
visability 6f yielding the people a voice
In the Government.
One thing which must commend it
self strongly to the Emperor is the fact
that the memorial represents the view
of able and moderate men, who have
no sympathy with revolution. They
have taken particular pains to dis
courage the student demonstrations
which were planned for Saturday and
Sunday in front of the Kazan Cathe
dral, and none occurred.
GIST OF THE SPEECHES.
ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 20. â The
Zemstvo representatives' meeting to
day adopted the remainder of the me
morial to the Government, and, be
sides, considered several supplemen
tary articles providing for practical
co-operation of the Zemstvos in the
Red Cross work and for extension of
school facilities. The vote on the
question of the adoption of the me
morial stood 88 to 10. The meeting
picbably. will be continued â¢ several
days. The memorial and minutes of
the meeting will be sent to Prince
Sviatopolk Mirsky, for transmission to
the Emperor. "What the result will
be is a matter of speculation, but the
men who have participated in this
meeting are In most cases influential
and able in their respective provinces
and they are resolved to press the
movement everywhere with the great
est vigor.
A Zemstvo banquet will be arranged
for December 4, the fortieth anniver
sary of the emancipation proclama
tion issued by Alexander II, and on
this occasion speeches along the line
of the memorial will be made. Later
the Zemstvos, which are to meet on
December 14, will be urged to adopt
resolutions embodying a similar pro
gramme of agitation.
The Government's attitude is await
ed with breathless interest. The mere
fact that a> meeting with a programme
was permitted, although' official aus
pices were denied it, is unprecedented;
but the vigorous character of the me
morial adopted and the resolution to
push the agitation must compel the
Government to act. A parting of the
ways i.=J again at hand and the au
tocracy, it would seem, must once
more choose whether the people shall
be allowed a voice in the Government,
for It is inconceivable that it can al
low an" agitation for a convocatlve
elective body to decide whether the
time has not come, in the language of
the memorial, "for an especially elect
ed body to participate in legislation,',
without the Intention of yielding.

the collection of private papers of
Christopher Columbus, which is now
in the possession of the Duke of Albe,
who resides here. The existence of these
priceless papers was recently brought
to light through the researches of Hen

embassy. He traced them from the
death of Columbus through sixteen de
scendents to the present possessor.
They embrace Columbus'logbook and
many other papers relating to his first
voyage to America and also part of
Columbus' library. The present Duke

touched on incidentally. He declared
he had not a candidate for either United

will call on the President to-morrow.
He said he thought an extra session of
Congress should be convoked for revis

matter should be disassociated from ev
ery other question.
Governor Van Sant said he was here
to interview Secretary Shaw on a per

President Roosevelt to-morrow . and
perhaps would have something to say
regarding his visit after that interview.

I .The Glambalvos family lived in the
rear of the store and succeeded in get
j ting out of the building, but before the
{ occupants on the upper floors were
j aroused ,thelr escape had been cut off.
Before the firemen arrlvÂ«d the fire had
communicated to the adjoining tene
ment, but its occuiants Tiad sufficient
warning and all escaped.
The work of the firemen was greatly
! hampered for a t|me by the crowds of
frenzied Italians who filled the streets.
I The tenants In nearly all the neighbor
ing buildings dragjreel their household
goods out of the buildings and with
them blockaded the way of the fire
apparatus.
All the bodies were found in the rear
room on the third floor and it was evi
dent that all had been suffocated In
their efforts to reach the fire escape at
j the back of the building. The two who
j were rescued were found in the lower
hallway soon after the firemen reached
! the scene. Working their way through
i the- building, the rescuers discovered
j the heap of dead on the third floor and
within a short time succeeded in tak
! ing out nine- bodies, but the last was
i not found until after 8 o'clock this
! morning.

'Â¦ daughter: Mary GaSgnoi, aged 18, and

NEW YORK, Nov. 20.â Smothered
before they could reach the fire escape
in a tenement house at 186 Troutman
street in the Wllliamsburg district of
Brooklyn, twelve persons met death
shortly Tbefore 2 o'clock this morning.
Two entire families, those of Maranio
Trlolo and Charles Polognlo. were
wiped out, the last living member of
each now being In a hospital with no
hope of recovery. They are Chanes
Polognio, 35 years of age, and Tony
Triolo, 13 years of ape, both of whom
are terribly burned. The burned house
is'in the center of a row of three-story
tenements, extending the length of the
block and was occupied by Italians.
The fire is supposed to have started
in the cellar of the grocery of
Antonio Glambalvos on the ground
floor. In the cellar was stored inflam
mable material and the flames spread
with lightning rapidity. All the occu
pants were asleep at the time and
there was- much delay In sounding the
first alarm.

B"ryan, leading Democrats say, can
make no valid claim to leadership
simply because Judge Parker has gone
down inglorlously. He lost his own
State of Nebraska four years ago. In
the late campaign he was seeking hon
ors through the election of a Legisla
ture that would send him to the United
States Senate. The people of Nebraska
expressed disapproval of his ambition.
CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20.â William J.
Bryan has begun his active campaign
for regaining control of the Democratic
organization. Autograph letters to ap
proximately twenty leading Democrats
have recently gone out from Lincoln.
In these letters Bryan suggested the
advisability of an eafrly meeting for
counsel and exchange of views on the
political situation. He said that no
definite day was in mind, but asked
his correspondents to recommend the
time and meeting place that would be
convenient.
The roster of Bryan's twenty leading
Democrats is fully known and there
are good reasons for believing Judge
Parker was not included. Neither were
several other prominent New York
Democrats, who figured as Parker's
chief supporters in the recent disas
trous campaign. Representative
Hearst, now said to be grooming again
for the nomination for President in
1908, has been written to.
One of the letters was to a Democrat
of wide reputation, who was In Wash
ington a few daya ago. This man, who
really has some authority to speak in
behalf of his party, replied, discourag
ing the project for a meeting. He as
serted his belief that it would be better
to eschew discussion of Democratic
policies for the present. Time would
show better what it was wisest to do.
In his judgment there was no occasion
for stirring up questions of organiza
tion at this time. .; :..'.' j

CUT OFF FROM
FIRE ESCAPES
An effort will be made to have
President Roosevelt pay a visit to the
California counties' exhibit when he
comes to the fair, toward the close of
this month, and a committee will be
appointed to extend the invitation.
The original cabin, in which the
President lived whije in South Da
kota, stands in that State's exhibit in
the Palace of Agriculture and he will
most likely visit it, as did his daugh
ter. California is but a few sections
from it.
Samuel Butler, in charge of the Na
vadu County mining exhibit, has al
ready sent an Invitation to the Presi
dent to call there and see the hand
some cabinet of gold specimens the
citizens of that county presented him
with when he was In California. The
casket is exhibited daily in Nevada
County's section. It will be sent to
Washington again immediately after
the close of the fair.-' 'Â¦-
It is said that the trouble has
been caused by the protests of some
whisky and beer manufacturers who
did not think they had received high
enough awards, and in consequence
appealed to the National .Commission.
That body, it is said, decided to heed
the protests of these manufacturers,
deeming them just, and give the
awards asked. The exposition of
ficiate denied its right to do so and
the announcement of awards was
withheld pending a settlement.
Finally a committee consisting of
three members of the National Com
mission and three members of the
superior Jury was appointed to thrash
the matter out. That committee
seems to be still thrashing. In the
meantime all exhibitors know what
prizes they have won, but -they have
no authorization from the exposition
to make use of their knowledge.
This has not prevented banners an
nouncing awards going up on many
exhibits about the fair.
TO INVITE PRESIDENT.
CALL BUREAU. PRESS BUILD
ING. ST. LOUIS, Nov. 20. â The Cali
fornia State Commission and other
exposition representatives of that
State are -wondering what good it
does to win a string of prizes if they
can't get them. It has been some
weeks now since the superior jury
approved the work of the department
juries, which gave California such
splendid recognition, but not an ex-,
hibitor has anything tangible to show
for the laurels that fell his way.
The deadlock between the National
Commission and the exposition
officials la still on, and some fear the
fair may close without a settlement
being reached, but this is an unwar
ranted apprehension. When the Na
tional Commission stepped in and
stopped the official announcement of
awards, on the ground that it had, a.
right to review them before they were
announced, it was supposed that it
merely wanted recognition and that it
would at once approve, being satisfied
with acknowledgment by the fair of
ficials that it was the final and highest
authority. It was in this belief, per
haps, that the heads of the fair so
readily granted the commission's de
mand. They did not think that the
national body would claim a right to
alter awards made or give any itself.

PRESIDENTS ADDRESS.
Dr. Stafford, the first speaker, told
of the work of St. Patrick's Parish, its
growth and its aim for the future. He
Introduced Cardinal Gibbons, who testi
fied to the value of the parish and
gave great credit to the efforts of its
rector. President Roosevelt was then
Introduced as "the man of even-handed
justice, the President of the 'square
deal.' "
The Knights of Columbus formed a
guard cf honor for the President, but
a squad of policemen was necessary
to open the way through the crowded
streets. Cheer after cheer went up as
the President and his escort appeared.
He was met at his carriage by Father
Stafford, and as he passed into the
rectory a children's choir of 200 voices.
stationed in front of the church, sang
hymns.
Before the ceremonies opened the
President was shown through the
handsome new rectory. When the
stepped out on the balcony he was
cheÂ«-reÂ«l loud!y. the demonstration in
creasing 1 when Cardinal Gibbons took a
place by the President's side and in
vited him to be seated.
"SQUARE DEAL" EXECUTIVE.
The intersection of Tenth and G
streets, Washington, was packed with
people, and the crowd extended fully
a square north and south, east and
we?t. from the rectory. Dr. Stafford
in his opening remarks referred to the
fact that in the century and more that
St. Patrick's Church had worked in
Washington, no honor had come to it
s.i prreat as the visit of President
Roosevelt.
WASHINGTON*. Nov. 20.â President
Rccsevelt made an address to-day at
the 110th anniversary celebration and
the dedication of new buildings at Car
roll Kail, i the parochial school. The
P*ev. Dr. J. Stafford, rector of St. Patl
rick's church, acted as master of <|ere
tnonlea. Cardinal Gibbons, several
archbishops and other dignitaries of
the Catholic church, attended the ex
ercises, the former making an address
Immediately preceding that of the
President. H. B. McFarlacd. president
of the beard of directors of the Dis
trict of Columbia, was the concluding
speaker. The addresses were made
from a balcony on the second floor of
the rectory and the audience gathered
in the streets.
CHURCH PAID TRIBUTE
After a speech by Commissioner Mc-
Farland the choir sang America and a
number of hymns. The President
joined in the singing and the audience
was not slow to follow. A number of
young church officials followed the
President to his carriage. He shock
hands with them and called heartily
as he drove away: "Good-by, boys. I
am glad to have been with you."
.rown to accept it as an axiomatic truth of
our American life that the man is to be treat
ed on his worth as a n:an without regard to
the accidents of his position; that this is not a
government designed to favor the rich man as
such, or tfce ixx>r as such, but that it is de
signed to Carer every Arr.?rican. rich or poor,
if he Is a decent man who acts fairly by his
fellows.
We have grown to realize that part of the
foundations upon which cur liberty rests is the
rieht of eac*> man to worship his Creator ac
cordir. to the dictates of his conscience and
the duly of each man to respect his fellows
who so wcrehip him.
*i.nd oh. my countrymen, one of the highest
au-uries for the future of this country, for
the future of this mighty and majestic nation
of ours lies in the fact that we brothers have
grov.-n to regard one another with a. broad end
kindly charity and to realize that the field for
f'uman endeavor Is wide; that the field for
charitable philanthropy is large, and that
while a corner r?mains untllled we do a
dreadful wrong If we fail to welcome the. work
done in that field by every man. no matter
what his creed provided that he works with a
lofty sr.r? of his duty to God and his duty to
his ocisbbor.

WANTS GOOD CITIZENS
The holy father. In his letter on the subject
last year, directed that this annual collection

JAMES CARDINAL GIBBON'S.
Chancellor of the Catholic University of
America.
As I am prepared to do all in my power to
build up the university and determined to
guarantee It against all loe?. even at thÂ« sac
rifice of ajl I possess, I feel assure*! that you
and your clergy will aid this sacred cause by
an earnest appeal to the generosity of the peo
ple under your chare*, and by personal sym
pathy for the work to which this collection is
applied.
The foregoing statement will naturally sug
gest a 1 variety of reflections, but what Is
really needed Just now is practical symDathy
and generous co-operation. This. I am happy
to say. has been shown by the trustees and by
friends of the university. The amounts which
they have guaranteed, together with the next
annual collection, which, it Is hoped. will
equal if not exceed that of last year, will en
able us to Invest a considerable sum after all
our current expenses are paid. Moreover, a
system cf financial administration has aiready
been adopted that for the future will render
the management of the funds absolutely se
cure. With the assistance of the hierarchy in
the manner Indicated by the holy father, we
feel confident that the university will be
placed on a sound financial baste.
In Justic* to those who, as individuals or as
associations, haveÂ»endowed the university, we
should see that its work is continued. Our
Catholic people. I sincerely believe, will aid
liberally in supporting an institution founded
by the American episcopate for the common
â¢ ood of the- clergy and laity in all our dio
ceses. To our non-Catholic fellow citizens,
our united efforts in behalf of the university
under any circumstances will plainly show
that wÂ» have at heart the b*st Interests of
education and that we are not to be thwarted
by difficulties.
On the other hand, pending the final adjust
ment of all .claims now in litigation, the uni
versity is in a large measure deprived of the
revenues which have heretofore been available
for its work- This Is the more regrettable at
the present time, when the university should
be so strer.gthsaed and developed as to attract
our Catholic young men and withdraw them
from non-Catholic institutions. "With the ut
most economy, as now practiced in every de
partment, the Income is not sufficient for the
necessary expenses.
Regarding the actual situation, I deem it my
duty to inform you that the funds hitherto
handled by the treasurer of the university ag
gregate IS81.000. The disposal of these funds
in no way involves the property of the univer
sity, its lands, buildings or equipment. The
funds themselves are protected by securities
which, it is confidently believed, will in any
equitable tettlement insure the university
against serloue Igsfpp.
"Resolved That his Eaiinence i the Chan
cellor of the Catholic University of America be
required to write and to eend to the hierarchy
of the United (states, one month before the
first Sunday of Advent. liÂ»O4, a letter of thanks
for the interest taken in the collection for the
university in 1S03 and asking them to kindly
ketp up their generous solicitude for this
worthy object by recommending it to the rev
erend clergy and the laiety of their reepectivo
Jurisdictions."
In pursuance of thtÂ» action of the trustees,
I desire to state that the contributions re
ceived from seventy-six dioceses amounted to
$lc5,O51. This generous response of our clergy
and people to the express wish of the sovereign
Pontiff is an evidence both of cheerful obedi
ence to the Holy See and of generous devotion
to their past orders. It la gratifying; and
encouraging to the trustees that bo widespread
an interest in the United State* should be man
ifested in the welfare of the university which,
embodying the highest form of Catholic learn
ing, is the mo5t important undertaking of the
hierarchy in view of the general good. In
the name of tht trustees, as in my own. I ten
der you, your clergy and your people grateful
acknowledgment tor the share you have taken
in the furtherance of this great work.
With the collection and with donations from
various source*, the receipts of the university
for last year, apart from its regular income,
amounted to $150,S09. Of this fund 56S.713
was employed in the. payment of debts. J50.000
was Invested and the remainder was used to
meet current expenses. As a result there was
no deficit last year, nor is there at present
any floating debt.
The^amount donate-d by the Knights of Co
lurr.bu* and not Included in the receipts men
tioned was $50,000. This also was invested',
making a total investment of $100,000. The
funds were placed for investment in the hands
of the finance committee appointed last year
il9C3), and composed of gentlemen who enjoy
th<r hghest reputation for Integrity and business
ability. The entire amount, therefore, result
ing from the collection is absolutely free from
the complications and risks to which, as you
doubtless have learned through the press, the
general endowment of the university has re
cently been exDosed.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20.â In accord
ance with an understanding reached at
the recent meeting of the board of
trustees of the Catholic University,
Cardinal Gibbons to-dav gave to the
press the following official letter, ad
dressed to the Catholic clergy:
CARDINAL'S RESIDENCE, BALTIMORE.
Md.. Nov. 17. 1904.â Right Rev. Dear Sir: The
board ot trustees of the Catholic University of
America, at tbeir meeting April 14, 1804. unan
imously adopted the following resolution:
The room was filled with gas fumes
and the stentorious breathing of the
A few minutes before 8 o'clock yes-*
terday morning a servant rapped at
the door of the room to arouse Mr.
and Mrs. Benedict for breakfast. Re
ceiving no response he knocked again
and again. Suddenly he detected the
odor of gas and then young Benedict
was hastily summoned. Hurrying ta
the apartments of his parents the anx
ious son forced the door and made the
startling discovery.
WIFE SHOWS IMPROVEMENT.
Saturday night he and his wife, after
an evening at home, retired at about
11 o'clock and for an hour thereafter
Benedict enjoyed his customary read
ing. Finally he turned off the light at
his bedside and went to sleep. Later
In the night Egbert Benedict, son of
the unfortunate couple, returned home
and went direct to his room, little sus
pecting that at that very moment his
parents were in danger of death.
Courtland S. Benedict, president of
the Hastings Clothing Company, and
his wife are lying in the shadow of
death at their home, 328 Valencia
street, sufferers from the inhalation of
illuminating gas, by which they were
nearly asphyxiated late Saturday night.
Although every remedy known to med
ical science is being resorted to in an
effort to revive them, up to a late hour
yesterday they were still unconscious.
Their attending physicians, Drs. Ken
ydn and Stevens, however, have not
abandoned hope of saving their- pa
tients and last evening they expressed
the belief that Mrs. Benedict, whose
condition is apparently less serious
than that of her husband, i3 slowly
showing signs of improvement.
The accident was due to a leaky gas
cock. It had long been a habit of
Courtland Benedict to read in bed, and
to afford himself j all possible comfort
in gratifying this desire he recently
had a dropllght connected with the
gas jet in his bedroom and placed near
the head of his bed.

The fire started about 2 o'clock and j
even before the telephone message was ,
received from the mountain top asking j
for help scores of men started fromÂ»
Pasadena for the mountain to help '
light the fire. In addition to these vol- \
unteers from Pasadena the railroad !
company summoned all the Cholo lab- ;
orers they could find, equipped them j
with shovels and axes and placed them i
at the disposal of the forest rangers, i
The flames spread with incredible j
rapidity and within an hour had ;
reached the top of the range. From the i
valley they appeared to be rushing in
the direction of Alpine Tavern. Only
a sudden change in the direction of the
wind saved that resort, but the fire was :
driven across the Mount Lowe railroad, !
licking up three bridges and destroying \
the ties and twisting the rails. \
At the tavern were more than 300 j
persons and for a time there was a;
panic among them. Women fainted ;
and strong men were helpless to avert :
the danger which seemed to threaten j
them. Some of them started for the
top of the range, hoping to escape down
the other side, but when the wind i
changed the danger passed and the
terrified people saw the fire sweep a
mile past them in another direction.
It was of course impossible to run
cars across the belt which had been
burned over. Passengers were taken as
far as possible toward Echo Mountain,
the terminus of the Mount Lowe in
cline, and from there they had to walk
across the burned district, hot and
smoky as it was.'
S. O. Symonds and B. C. Bruce of
this city were on a narrow trail direct
ly in the path of the flames. They
were cut off from the railroad and
saved their lives only by running down
the mountainside.
A telephone message from the moun
tains to-night reports that the fire is
under control, but from Los Angeles it
appears to be spreading. The tops of
the mountains to the northward appear
to be aglow and even at this distance,
twenty miles, the fire presents a grand
spectacle. I * J 2 Â£ â¢
' What the "effect! toU> be upon the
water supply of Pasadena' and other
cities will not be known for several
days. Another force of men was sent
out to-night to fight the fire. Nearly
200 men are now fighting the flames.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 20.â A forest
fire of unknown origin swept up Los
Flores canyon this afternoon, seriously
damaging the Mount Lowe Railway line
to the mountain top. It threatened for a
time to destroy the famous Alpine Tav
ern, the railroad company's fine hotel
near the summit, and devastated many
square miles of mountain forest. Nearly
300 Sunday excursionists were cut off
by the flames and some of* them had to
pass a mile through the fire zone, cross
deep canyons and crawl around the
embers of burned bridges to reach their
cars.

In an official letter, addressed
to the Catholic clergy, Cardinal
Gibbons makes plain the pres
ent financial condition of the
Catholic University of America.
He says the institution will not
lose heavily through the in
solvency of former Treasurer
\Vag5amam1, as the funds di
verted by that failure are pro
tected by securities; but, pend
ing: a settlement, the university
is in 0 large measure deprived
of the revenues hitherto avail
able for its work. Cardinal
Gibbons calls upon Catholics to
be liberal in their support of the
university during this crisis and
gives a guarantee against ulti
mate loss, even though he be
compelled to sacrifice all of his
possessions. The university has
no Coating debt, and already its
investment fund is assuming
large proportions. The receipts
for the past year, apart from Its
regular Income, have amounted
to $150,000.

In 1902 a lady by the name of Alice B. Peterson was collecting curios ia
Alaska. She started from Southeastern Alaska, going beyond Nome, almost to
the Arctic Circle, over to the Keewallk River, on Ko.tzebue Sound.
While she was stopping at the Keewallk Road House some Eskimos, headed
by Captain Popick. also a native, pulled ashore in their skin boats two huge mas-
todon tusks. They related the following interesting story:
They went up the Buckland River to a point 500 miles from Nome and 200
miles south by west from the Arctic circle and learned about the huge tusks
that had been seen by other natives, under the Buckland Glacier.
The existence of the tusks was known to the natives for years, even back
for two generations, although previous efforts to extract them had been futile,
as they were buried in the Ice about 16 feet under the water of the river which
flowed past the glacier. The water in the Buckland River Is very clear. In
fact, it is possible to count the pebbles in the bottom. Thou?!: the tuslcs were
easily seen, the natives found it impossible to extricate them, as the current of
the river at this point was very strong.
Between the 10th and loth of August. 1902. the water in the Buckland
River was the lowest in history of the stream, known to the natives.
Captain Popick and hi3 small band then determined to procure the tusks.
After several days" hard work the tusks were secured, although two natives
were drowned In the endeavor. Loading their prize on beats, they drifted down
the river to Eschscholtz Bay, and thence^ to the mouth of the KeewalU River.
As soon as Miss Peterson viewed the, tusks she negotiated with the natives
for them, and after much parleying she made the Eskimos a cash offer to-
gether with some goods in trade. They accepted, and the curios were at once
shipped to the United States.
Upon learning about the tusks. S. N". Wood & Co.. 740 Market street, secured
them for a two weeks* exhibit.
The tusks are each 12 feet In length. 20 inches in circumference at the base
and weigh together 350 pounds.
Scientists consider these the largest tusks extant, as the longest heretoforÂ«
, found measured only 11 feet. Another peculiar feature ia the unusual curve or
these specimens. When placed with the points together they form a graceful
arch.
They are solid Ivory, "and at the figure ivory is worth. J1.50 a pound. thÂ« ac-
tual value of the tusks from a commercial standpoint is 51225.00.
However, as curios, they are worth several thousands of dollars.
Mastodons are supposed to have inhabited the earth at some prehistoric pe-
riod when the Arctic region was a tropical country. Scientific research has de-
veloped certain facts which show that the frozen north was once a sunny clime.
Bamboo, purely a native of tropical lands, has been found buried in the ice and
well preserved to this day.
If the mastodon was as large In proportion to his tusks as the eleohajit Is
In proportion to his, the size of this enormous manrmal is almost beyond Human
comprehension.
Everybody is welcome to view the display, which is the first and last tima
the tusks will be exhibited. â â - , w â,

soon remove them to his private collection. The purchase was made Wednesday

Baid an autopsy would be required and
even th^n, judging from the condition
of th*Â» corpse, such an pxamlnation
might be of little avail. The only re

question whether or not a bullet had
caused death.
Hidden by a tangle of brush and
thickets, the body of a man, with
Â¦what iooks like a bullet wound in the
side, was uncovered this morning on
the bank of Cemetery Creek on the
Pierce estate, near the Junction of

remains were p<> badly decomposed
that identification would be next to
Impossible. The body's condition in

The demand for real estate in this section is
unusually good for this time of the year, and
I exDect an even better market during the
cornincr winter. I Among the recent sales made
by my 1 Office are: Flat and store In Frultval*
avenue business block to William Vlelbaue for
$4noo. Purchaser h*Â« already begun the erec
tion of a bakery. Rouse and lot on northwest
corner of Frultvale avenue and Blossom street
to Edward B. James of Redlands for $3000.
H. A. Pleitner. a well-known real
estate dealer of Frultvale. finds an
active market He says:
The following ar* some of our recent sales:
House and tot on Blossom street to William
and Ada Hoperoft. nous* and tot on LJese
avenue to John C and May C. Steyer. two lota
In Linda Park to Thomas Klnnev. two lots In

ler house and lot in Westsll Tract to Edith
Scnutt<Â», house and Idt ort Tevls street \4 Al
frtd F. Scoffler, five-acre tract in Vtv*f
Frultvale to Theo Jacobs.
All these sales have been, made since th*
first of the present month.
H. Barkmeyer of Frultvale says:
There is a brisk demand for Fruit vale real
estate, and at present considerable building is
eoinz on. The new Postofflce is nearly com
pleted and grrrtind Is now bÂ°ir\g broken for a
two-story business block which will contain
four Btores, with apartments on the second
floor. The new block is being erected at tha
corner of Frilltvate aVenue and East Four
teenth street.
We hope to be able to locate a large retail
mercantile enterprise from another State,
whose management Is desirous of locating here
with an eye to the present and future business
of Oakland. This firm will require 40,000
sauare feet of retail floor space, which means
a four-story building, size 100x100. A rental
of $9000 per annum has already been made to
one of Oakland's real estate owners and re
fused by him. We also have negotiations on
whK-h we hoiÂ«Â» to close In the near future for
a new building of this slse for this new firm.
The last ten days has also brought a very
Important inquiry in the way of a manufac
turing concern that Is desirous of locating on
Oakland's water front with water and rail
facilities. This company hails from San
Francisco and believes that Oakland Is des
tined in thp future to secure the manufactur
ing enterprises of that City. This company
would send out from Oakland an average of
from six to ten carloads of products daily and
would employ over SOO laborers, meaning an
addition to our population of over 100O people.
There will bo only 0t)<Â» tl^ng In the way of
keeping this company from locating here, and
that is th* Fhallowness of the East Oakland
channel. One can easily s^e the importance
of having ithe Government deepen this* chan
nel so as to permit de*p sea vessels to call at
the factory for products. It is a well-known
faCt that rre*ent day constructed Vessels Â¦ re
quire greater draught than those of the past.
I merely cite thes# many Instances tÂ» give
the public an Jd*a of the wonderful future
that lies In Stor* for this city- whenever th<Â»
manufacturing enterprises of this coast have
the convenient means of transportation. Â¦ ".
On account of the new ferry service we .have
Just sold to Miles Standlsh, manager of the
Albion Lumber Company of San Francisco, a
magnificent Piedmont Villa site, eize 100x200
feet, situate on the north line of Montedto
avenue, luo feet east of Oakland avenue, being
& portion of the well-known Myers block,
which block already contains the magnificent
residences of Mrs. J. T. Barradough, the Gor
rills. Dr. Mehrmann and A. L. Scott. These
homes range in value from $23,000 to $50,000
each, and Mr. Standlsh's home is expected to
compare vtry favorably with them. Mr.
Ftandlsh expects to begin Immediate construc
tion.
In the northern section of Oakland and the
district lying between Oakland and Berkeley
and Berkeley proper, new homes are springing
up remarkably fast. This marked activity la
also perceptibly noticeable in North Oakland
and Piedmont along the line of the new trans
portation facilities of the Key Route. l"he
new ferry service is also noticeable to us on
account of commuters in the past having to
set near the local traina now having two
routes of transportation tn choose from, and
when Oakland is favored with Key Route
transportation into the heart of the city, Oak
land will take on such activity as has never
been experienced In the history of the city.
The general impression is prevailing that the
Southern Pacific Company is preparing
tt> turn its local lines into electrio service
is creating a marked condition in the Inquiries
and value of property along the lines of its
present service. Therefore the impression of
the people in general, both local and non-resi
dent, is that Oakland to-day has one of the
mest assured futures and the brightest pros
pects of any city on the coast, as local trans
portation facilities have in the past been one
of the greatest features of attracting popula
tion to this side of the bay, and with such ad
ditional facilities the city is bound to grow as
it never has before.
There has been a marked increase la busi
ness during the past week: The number of In
quiries tor Oakland residential and business
property, both for rent and fur sale, haa been
much heavier than in the last few weeks, the
inquiry being general for property throughout
the city and Its suburbs. At the present ratio
oi lnqurirtes and sales of property to new peo
ple on this side oi the bay and the new homes
now in course of construction, it is safe to es
timate that there are annually locating in Oak
land, Berkeley and Ftuitvale an Increased
peculation of nearly lU.Ow people.
Believing 1 that in the near future
Oakland is destined to become an Im
portant manufacturing and distribut
ing center of the Pacific Coast, many
business men, who are at present lo
cated in the Northern and Eastern
States, are making inquiries as to the
prices of property in this city, in
tending to engage in business here.
Local real estate men express the
opinion that the coming winter will
witness a large Increase in the mer
cantile community of the city, and as
nearly all of these newcomers may
be expected to buy or build homes of
their own. dealers in suburban and
city real estate look for an extremely
active winter market.
One of the most potent factors in
the development of Oakland and the
consequent increase in its population
is the great improvement in trans
portation facilities between this city
and San Francisco. As a direct result
of this improvement several sales of
Oakland property have recently been
made to San Francisco business men.
who will hereafter make their homes
on this eide of the bay. The most im
portant of these sales has Just been
reported by William J. Laymance, who
reports the purchase of an elegant
villa site, 100 by 200 feet, in Alonte
clto avenue, in Piedmont, by Miles
ytandish, manager of the Albion Lum
ber Company of San Francisco.
Berkeley, North Oakland, East Oak
land and Alameda are receiving their
share of the general prosperity. Dur
ing the last year the increase in home
building in North Oakland and Berke
ley has been almost phenomenal and
in the last two months there has been
a decided advance in the demand for
East Oakland and Alameda property.
At a meeting of the real estate
dealers of East Oakland held Wednes
day evening at the office of Albert
Schmidt an organization was formed
for the purpose of advertising East
Oakland real estate. It was decided to
begin a system of extensive advertis
ing in the Oakland, San Francisco
and 1 Eastern newspapers at once. An
other meeting will be held Â«on Wed
nesday evening at the same place, at
which' officer? will be elected and per
manent organization effected.
Â»\Viliijirn J. Laymance. president of
the Laymance Keal Estate Company,
is , well satisfied with the present con
dition of the market. He said:

ARRANGE -TWO SESSIONS
1 Thieves with a '.keen-japprtfeiation of
the beautiful plants and â¢ in
Professor E. W. Hilgard's home
grounds at 2728 Bancroft way have for
two weeks, taken, each- night,
part of the plant life there, until, as
Professor Hilgard said to-day, "My
yard look's ' like . a dismantled wheat
field." ,
Two of the. thieves were detected in
the act at an early hour this morning,
by Deputy Marshal Reginald Cope, but
they were frightened by his approach
and fled before the peace officer could
effect a capture.
Cope was advised by Marshal Kerns
a week ago that the Hilgard grounds
were being visfted regularly by.- plant
thieves, and that it > would be well to
watch the plaoe with more than usual
care. Cope, accordingly was pretty well
aware of -the character of the visitors
he found in the Hilgard place this
morning, when, just before sunrise, as
he walked UD Bancroft way he saw
two figures "moving about through the
trees and shrubbery. They were on the
lookout, too, and heard or saw Cope

â¢ "* ' 2148 Center " Street,' Nov. 20.
before he got within a hundred feet of
them. The deputy marshal fired two
shots at the fleeing vandals, but neith
er apparently took effect, for the men
ran until they eluded the marshal.
Professor Hllgard believes that a pro
fessional florist, or thieves who know
very well what are the most valuable
plants, and which plants would most
easily be disposed of, are the persona
who have despoiled his beautiful
grounds.
"The thieves have been careful to
select rare and beautiful ferns and
such plants," said Professor Hllgard
to-day. "It is 1 evident that Â«o common
or ignorant fellow has done the work,
for in the very beginning the finest
plants I had were taken, and selected
with discrimination. I mourned their
loss but consoled myself with the re
flection that I still had beautiful plants
left. When these, too, began to fade
way I was sure that some evil per
sons had decided to use my grounds as
a supply house to either replenish their
own gardens and yards, or to obtain
stuff for sale to others. I wish no one
any harm, but I sincerely hope that the
Berkeley police department may cap
ture and punish the persons who have
so thoroughly despoiled my grounds."

Grandson of . the ' Late Famous Soldier
Chosen to Attend Roosevelt
n| Washington.
Lleutenant|U. S. Grant III, who ar
rived from the -Philippines -on â¢ the
transport Thomas and who has been
a gue3t at the Palace for several days,
left yesterday for .Washington; Upon
his arrival there he will enter upon
the duties of military aid to President
Roosevelt "at the White House; . This
Li the first time that a ; Grant has
served in the White House since the
young lieutenant's illustrious grand
father was the President of the coun
try aaid it will be the first time that an
officer of the army has been regularly
detailed as military aid to a President
of the United States. ..
In years past officers have been de
tailed for various work at the White
House, but never officially as the Pres
ident's aid. Young Grant's station
while serving in the new -posi
tion will be at Washington "Bar
racks. His duties will be simply to at
tend the President wherever ; he may
go. The position is .one. that was
sought by many of the younger, officers
of the army, who were greatly.disap
pointed when the official . announce
ment was made that Lieutenant Grant
had been selected for the place. \
The audience was delightful and a
sight to see, one huge smile from the
orchestra to the last row of the gal
lery. Its Joy in the occasion was all
but pathetic. Every little tit-bit of the
opera, the sextet, the harp solo, the
"mad section." was jealously encored,
rolled under the tongue, to prolong the
delight as far as possible. Each artist
was salvoed into a condition of al
most hysteric enthusiasm, and all
did better than their best â SIgnor
Borghese excepted. Of the chorus this
is particularly true, the feminine end
of it being splendidly voiced and excel
lently sure of Itself, singing as if it
muld eat every note of the score.
Xapoleoni's six feet led the male chorus
as usual, and simply wallowed In the
pleasure of It.
As a whole, considering the circum
stances of production, the performance
was remarkably smooth, only for Bor
ghese. the Henry Ashton of the cast,
the prompter might have taken a day
off. Sipnor Borghese. however, kept
him pretty busy. But all the rest
knew th^eir parts. How little Russo
joyed in his: and â but the ladles first â
"the" lady first I am glad to have
heard Mme. Francisca In opera. I'm
sorry I did not hear her first in opera.
Still, that was not my fault. If sing
ers so obviously fitted pnly for the
stage will take to the concert platform
they must take the consequences.
In opora, veritably, Mme. Francisca
is almost Incredibly better. Twould
sfcm there were almost more in this
than meets the ear. Just why the sing
er should yesterday keep most sensi
tively on pitch, "phrase fittingly, some
times beautifully, use color in free and
full fashion, and vocalize clearly, on
the whole, after her distinctly unsatis
fying performance at her first concert,
rather perplexes. Nervousness one is
used to noting more in the sustained
note than in scales and frills. Pitch,
too, is commonly affected in such cases.
But fiorlture, pitch, color, everything
was affected in Mme. Francisca's con
cert appearance. One wonders If It
were a matter of study, if the singer
were not In good practice. Then one
wonders again if it were simply the re
straint of the concert platform.
In face of her yesterday's Lucia,
thoroughly dramatic, it would not be
difficult to accept the latter explana
tion. Dramatically Mme. Francisca's
Is one of the best Lucias we have had.
Her performance was. If anything, too
strenuous, perhaps a negligible fault
In the circumstances. Quite interesting
are two or three of her bits of "busi
ness." as where after her wedding
scene she tears the veil from her hair,
and again where she crowns herself
with rosesâ a la Opheliaâ in the mad
scene. All through Mme. Francisca
showed herself an earnest" and accom
plished actress. The voice I found
anmv delightful, so pure, even, fresh
and full, so large and sweet to the up
permost notes, so round to the lowest.
One desired greatly the last clearness
of articulation it lacks, the final grace
of phrase, distinction, character, but
given these and Mme. Francisca would
belike not be singing In dollar ofr^ra,
She waÂ«? lavishily and deservedly ap
plauded. S
Ru5so I have yet to hear in finer
trim than he was yesterday as Edgar
do. His voice wes fresh as In "the old
Lombardi days. His singing also con
spicuously free from the exaggerations
that have not seldom marred It. There
was not an InchS4?o much of his top
netes, and his mezzo voice work was
beautiful as ever and not overdone.
The whole effect was particularly hap
py in the fortunate blend of the Ru3so
and Francisca voices, some of the en
semble work being entirely delightful.
Borghese brought his smooth and vi
brant barytone into useful service, but
one felt his memory insecure through
out. Wanrell made a remarkably good
Raymond and a new and thlnnish ten
or, "zarala. a soulful Sir Arthur Buck
law. The production â oh, well, who
minds having the "Gypsy Baron" hall
for the Ashtc-n reception room, or hav
ing the Lammermoor skies punctured
with the Illuminations of the Paris ex
position â see "The Messenger Boy"!
Not I. Final credit goes to M. Jacques
Conn for the skillful stage management
and Mr. Stelndorff had every reason to
beam over his baton at the augmented
orchestra. . i ;;...-"â' ,
Â¦ Two extra performances of the opera
have been arranged for next Friday
evening and the Saturday matinee.
It is recommended to those that see
'The Runaways" at the California this
week not to prelude It with "Lucia," as
I did. The runaways are sad when
they sing, particularly the female end,
and with the Tjvoli's spilling Kate Con-
v dons and Dora de Fllllppes into musical
* comedy one has dropped Into a pesky
habit of expecting the same. But for
get all that and remember Arthur Dunn.
BuylrVe Mr. Dunn you would ask for
small 3'sâ he Just escapes midgetry.
But there Is nothing miniature about
the Dunn humor. He is a tull-blooded
comedian, deft, pert, smart and quick
ness itself. His dancing reminds of
"Jimmy" Powers, and his singing gets
over the footlights far enough to dis
tribute some uncommonly funny
Grand opera Is like death; It levels all
distinctions â all San Francisco distinc
tions anyway. Telegraph Hill and
Pacific avenue and everything between
met at the Tivoli* yesterday afternoon
shouting mad bravas or splitting suede
after its different fashions over the one
grand opera of the year. Opera-hun
gry? You would say so. A day over
a week ago it was whispered that the
Tivoli would give "Lucia" yesterday.
Seats went on sale on Monday. On
Wednesday there were 'no more to be
had, and yesterday afternoon the hope
ful were offering enough to keep a
small family on for a week for the
privilege of a chair planted anywhere.
By the grace of Mr. Leahy some of
them got it, but scores went opera
hungry down Eddy street yesterday.
There is talk of repeating the opera."
Certainly it would be the part of wis
dom. If any doubt were possible a3
to the place grand opera holds In the
affections of San Francisco, yesterday
must settle it. It was not the cast,,
though Jimp. Francisca was an attrac
tion of .curiosity. Neither was it the
opera in particular â "Lucia" in a sea
eon draws only semi -largely. It was
grand opera, the kind of music, choral,
orchestral, solo, that appeals most
vitally and generally here as a form
of entertainment. #
To-day beins Sunday many men took
to the hills and ravines In a fruitless
search for some clew that might lead
to the conviction or prove the Innocence
of Adolph Weber. The pistol must be
found. Without It the mystery may
never be solved.
The dreadful affair is still the all ab
sorbing to^ic, and was referred to to
day In the churches. Rev. A. K. Glo
ver of St. Luke's Episcopal Church
took his text from St. Matthew 9. 24.
"The Maid is N'ot Dead, but Sleepeth."
and preached a touching sermon on the
Immortality- of the soul.
The conversation that took place be- j
tween nephew and aunt was not of a ;
startling: nature. Weber asked his aunt j
about the headstones to be placed at
the graves of the victims of the trage- :
dy. Mrs. Snowden replied that she had
not given the matter a thought. Young
Weber then told his aunt to suit her
self about the monuments.
When Mrs. Snowden said "Good-by,
Dolphy," Weber did not reply.
It is bpliev^d at the sheriff's office
that young Web3r"s request for a visit
from his aunt was made with the hope
that he might frighten her.
The preliminary examination of Web- j
er will be resumed to-morrow morning
before Justice E. O. Smith. Mrs. Snow-:
den will be put on the stand again and !
so will Adrian Will?. Dr. J. F. White, j
whose analysis proves that there were
blood stains on the trousers which
Weber threw Into the fire will not be
called. His testimony will be held back
until the trial before the f^perior
Court. Who tho* witnesses for T.ie de
fense are. or whether they will have
any. Is not known.
Justice Smith has already ordered the
court reoorter. to transcribe the testi
mony.
AUBURN. Nov. 20.â Mrs. Snowden
called on Adolph Weber at the county j
Jail this morning. Her visit was caused j
by a request that she visit him made by
young "Weber- 'himself. It will !
be remembered that Mr*. Snow- ;
den's testimony was the most
damaging produced at either the
coroner's inquest or at the preliminary ,
examination. "Tour turn is coming
next" were the words used by Adolph j
Weber as ' he left the Snowden house
last Saturday morning, and his words i
w ere directed to hl3 aunt. Mrs- Snow- J
den. Since then she has not spoken to i
him. except in his cell to-day. She j
was afraid of him, and asked that an j
officer be near her every minute of the j
time she was in the cell with young
Weber. Deputy May stood beside her j
and Deputy Fulton was Just out3ide
the cell door.. i
Scedal Dispatch to The Call.
A Thanksgiving collection was taken
amounting: to over $1000. Dr. Meserve
said that the congregation of Plymouth
Church is Increasing and there i3 more
enthusiasm and devotion than former
ly. The church, he said. Is out of debt
and all expenses are paid to the end
of the year.
To what the President has mentioned we ndd
"God's salvation" â a religion that produces
progress and liberalism, rather than what Jinn
Morley points out in the Latin. American "re
publics." The basis of Greek orthodoxy is fear.
The basis of oilr faith Is love. Fear breeds
tyranny. Love brings trust, freedom, progress,
hopefulness. For this religion are we grateful.
Let us have more of it. Taks and live It,
spread and Â»njoy it.
Prosperity is another caure for thanksjriring.
The President means realized and utilized
wealth; It Is too much concentrated, surely,
but after all, our people are wonderfully well
off. A campaign against the saloon, graft and
infidelity is called for in political &nd religious
life - In thig land. War to the . knife' against
then-, all!
The President calls attention to things 'for
which we are to give thanks. First of all
come the harvest*. Thes* are the bÂ»M for
years. As more land IÂ« cultivated, more wheat
and corn will be harvested. Our forefathers
asked Â¦ no philosophic questions, but Just
thsnksd God. We do not take the same rlew
of the relation of divine power to results, but
we are none the less truly and earnestly grate
ful. That corn train In Iowa, with Its IesÂ«on
of selection (Intelligent, not "natural") show*
the modern way of using the earth, but It Is
God's earth Just the same, and what we get
from it we thank him for.
After the harvest comes peace. We are
thankful that there Is no Manchurlan cam
paign en for us. No Colombian war. not ev.Â»n
police duty in China. No North PÂ«a irrita
tions are exciting, our passions. No Jingo spirit
In making an International nuisance of tin*
country. We hare no civil war on hand, and
we are. not likely to have. ThÂ« struggle be
tween labor and capital Is mere ar.U mow get
ting within lawful bounds. There are f<Â«wer
lynchings than formerly. The crtmÂ«s of lust
are fewer, and therefore the crimes of fury art"
less. Gradually th2 colored people are ristnjc
in . intelligence, morals and ??l[-cQntrcl, and
mere and more the whit's are preparing to
care for them. There has been no Indian war.
except the struggles of the football team* with
white' collpgen and among themselves. The In
dian is ceasing as a cause of strife. He is be
ing educated, attached to the *oll. and made
religious. It Is a great and good thing, and
gratitude to God Is called for in connection
therewith.
Taking President Roosevelt's Thanks
giving Day proclamation for his theme
the Rev. I. C. Meserve, D.D., preached
a sermon yesterday morning at Ply
mouth Congregational . Church, Post
street, near Buchanan, in which he re
viewed the material conditions which
have been enjoyed by the country since
the last Thanksgiving celebration.

IX his letter of greeting and advice to the delegates attending the
National Irrigation Congress at El Paso, President Roosevelt
enunciated definitely the broad ground of permanency which must
characterize all efforts at the development of the arid West. Perma
nency and the unity of all interests in the fulfillment of the destinies
promised by the country's highest resources must mark every ef
fort at reclamation and improvement. V '
"The period of exclusiveness is past," says President Roosevelt
in his message. "The stock interests are no longer independent of
â¢ the mining interests, nor either of them independent "of the
irrigator. A closer interweaving than ever before is at hand among
all the great interests of the whole country. One cannot prosper
without the other." â¢; . .
No truer word has been spoken upon the outlook for the future
prosperity of Ihe great West. In advocating this broad general
ground of co-operation between the varied interests that draw their
support from the ground in the final instance the President has ex
pressed the far-seeing policy of conservation. The West is no
longer new. The pioneers, the first comers, opportunists all of
them, have done their work of "skimming the cream" off the natural
resources and their day is done. It is not for us to sap the wealth
of the rich country without reparation any longer, but to build well
the cjoundwork for future yield of increase Â¦' r ;-' ;

PRINCE SADANARU FUSHIMI, adopted brother of the Mi
kado and bearer of imperial felicitations from that potentate to
President Roosevelt, has been received with all official honors
zt Washington and given the Executive's assurance of America's
friendship and deep seated interest in the island empire. That much
is along the strict lines of diplomatic courtesy and but answers the
requirements of the situation. Diplomats both here and abroad are
asking themselves what is behind this visit of the Japanese Prince
which may or may not become manifest!
When Prince Fiishimi arrived here in San Francisco he admitted
that he was the bearer of private messages from the Mikado to
the head of the nation. He added, furthermore, that though he was
then unable to divulge the nature of this communication its import
would become known after President Roosevelt himself had be
come its recipient. The President has doubtless been formally ten
dered this confidential message ere this and pending his decision
concerning the disposition of it, men of international affairs, espe
cially those wearing the uniform of the Czar, have to content them
selves with speculation.
- Should it become known that the Mikado's niessage was one
of direct invitation to R,oosevelt to use his good offices in ending the
conflict in the Far East no great surprise would result. It is known
that Japan has already approached Great Britain unofficially in the
matter of intervention ; the recent speech of Lord Lansdowne inti
mated that upon England and the United States rested the respon
sibility of taking the initial step. President Roosevelt has declared
his determination to have no part in the. affair until representations
looking in the direction of intervention were made to him Â»by both
belligerents.
Though the pride of Russia weighs heavily in the balance, it
must be believed that a direct appeal in this behalf on the part of
Japan to the President would have its effect in the councils of the
Czar and open the way for similar action on Russia's part. By its
consistent attitude of strict neutrality this country has disproved the
early suspicions of partiality and demonstrated its fitness to serve
jusly as possible arbiter.

Many a man who has given marriage
serious thought is still in the bachelor

Kisses which a young man may ac

The economic tpnditions in those

Does second marriage mean a dese

an infidelity, though not so regarded

one's dead self to higher things â or to
things at least as high?
Considered as a matter of public
importance this complex question has

It has been considered peculiarly fit

and that vrJLp all there was to it.
Divorce and its results aside, second
marriages are less common among the
educated classes of the United States
to-day than they were formerly â for
ihe simple reason that nowadays mor
tality of wives is less. In colonial
days it was as much a matter of
course for a mother to die young as
it was for a maid to marry young.

The sentiment which leads to a
second marriage, however, may be
only on one side. Men are more ca
pable of marrying for love a second
time than women are. \
The latter are not unlikely to be
influenced by motives like those to
which the naive "Lady" Crlltenden,
a Kentucky matron of the early half
of the last century, confessed.
"I have been married three times,
and In each alliance I have got Just
what I wanted," said she ingenuously.
"My first marriage was for love, and
it was mine as fully as I could wish;
my second for money, and heaven was
good to me in this instance; my third
was for position, and that, too, is
mine. What more could 1 ask?"
"What more, indeed!" humorously
exclaims her modern chribmcler.
Men, on the other hand, notably
acquire distinction with year3; often
they are better qualified at 45 or 50
to excite a tender passion in woman's
heart than they were in callow, youth.
There is no love in such a union to
begin with, but a deep and enduring
affection may In time develop.
Yet, in general, second marriages
to-day are founded upon sentiment.
The fact that widows do not positively
have to marry in order that they and
their children may live â added to the
fact that, because small families are
now the rule, widowers can manage
to worry along without helpmates â
puts remarriage upon a new basis.
Romance and love appear upon the
horizon. A chance is given for the
poignancy of grief to change into that
loneliness of spirit, and that restored
sense of personality which, taken to
gether, invite love.
Love is not the prerogative of youth
any more than are the charms which
inspire it. There are many women
who are far more attractive to men
in maturity than they were 83 de
butantes. In this the fair sex has the
eucouragemoht of famous precedent.

SECOND MARRIAGES
POINTED PARAGRAPHS.
5HORT fitted jackets combining the fashionable cape are among the best
of the midseason novelties, and when a vest. is added the style is com
plete. Such is the smart wooltex model of the illustration, in which
a mannish tweed is brought to dressy requirements in the little vest
and the tc-uch of velvet that is a prerequisite to this season's modes. The
little coat has a very full puff sleeve that will accommodate without
crushing the dressy sleeves of the blouse beneath. The skirt is arranged
with hip yoke, to which the fullness is applied in box pleats headed with
a triangular insert of velvet defined with braid. This, also passes down
the front, and the full hem, bound with brown velveteen, is headed with
a band of white cloth to match the vest, edged with velvet and trimmed
with braid.
"Oh, Teddyboy is yours â take him,"
responded the man wearily. "You

forward.
"Xo, no," she cried, impulsively.
"The long, floppy ones are much

you had cut them. And I â I â we

sprang to her side.
"Are you people never coming?"*
called a voice from the boat. "If you
are engagad, please remember that
the rest of us are mere prosaic mor
tals and must get home for dinner."
Mathewson, his face aglow with
suppressed excitement, leaned over the
rail.
"Just a second till I -get my cap."
he answered jubilantly. "I am com
ing ashore with you after all. Thaf3
it. Steady now, Sybil, these steps are
steep; and for heaven's sake don't
drop Teddyboy!"
(Copyright, 1904, by A. M. Davies
Ogden.)
"I am indeed greatly to be congrat
ulated," she said, composedly. "See
what a dear little dog I have Just
gained."
Mathewson bit his lip. He had not
known exactly what he had expected,
but It was certainly not this. The girl
with calm self-control took up her role
of hostess, insisting that the older
woman should make the tea, quietly
ordering a fresh supply of anything
lacking. Mathewson watched her. a
dull -ohe at his heart. How sweet,
how womanly she was. His audacious
announcement to Mrs. Marshall had
been the fruit at an impulse actuated
by such varied and complex motives
that he himself 'could tot entirely dis
entangle his reasons for It.
He had never dreamed of finding
her at Easterly, much less on his own
beat. But seeing her now, gracious,
tactful, dispensing his hospitality to
his guests, the empty mockery of: it
all. the bitterness of this travesty upon
his longings brought a tightening to
his throat. Why had he not been able
to keep her in those old days? When
Mrs. Marshall rose he contrived that
Miss Wainwright should be the last to
leave. As she moved toward the gang
way Mathewson interposed.
"You must forgive me," he began
unsteadily. "I â I meant well. But
I was probably wrong! I usually am.
The yacht is only here for the day. I
was leaving to-morrow in any case.
You can then deny the engagement â
break it â what you will. You know
well how I feol."

eyes.

Magistrate Kochersperger of Phlla
.delphia believes it is a wife's preroga
tive to search her husband's pockets
but that a husband has no right to look
into his wife's pocket-book without her
permission, says the North American.
He expressed the opinion in disposing
of the qase of John S. Williams, who
was before him charged with threaten
ing his wife.
Williams said that all of the trouble
; between him and his wife was due to
a slip of paper which he happened to
find in her pocketbook.
"Don't you know," said the Magis
j trate sternly to the prisoner, "that you
j have no right to search your wife's
1 pocketbook? I believe ""it Is a wife's
prerogative to search her husband's
pockets, but a husband should not look
! into his wife's pocketbook unless she
! gives him permission to do so."
Williams was too surprised to make
any answer. He was required to enter
i bail to keep the peace.
WIFE MAY SEARCH HER
HUSBAND'S POCKETS
The striking feature was the remarkable exhibit of the bank
clearings. Of the fifteen most important cities every one except New
Orleans showed an increase over the same week last year, and out
of ine first forty cities and towns in the list only two â New Orleans
and Salt Lake 'Cityâ showed a loss. The gain for the whole coun
try was 53.5 per cent. This percentage of gains is a record breaker.
Some of the gains were extremely large. New York, for instance,
increased 79.8 per cent, Pittsburg 35.8 per cent, St. Louis 29.3 per
cent, and so on. The gain at San Francisco was 15.5 per cent. The
aggregate clearings were enormous and perhaps the largest ever
known, running up to $3,242,000,000. If these clearings are a true
index to the condition of trade, then the expansion in general busi
ness last week was surprising. Jt was the more gratifying, inasmuch
as there was no line particularh' favored, the improvement being
general throughout the whole list of produce and merchandise.
Nor was the improvement confined to domestic commerce. The
foreign trade also showed an expansion and is now making a much
better exhibit than for some time. The exports in October were
$162,570,000, beating every month on record except October, 1900,
which ran about $800,000 over these figures â a mere bagatelle.
'Another especially gratifying feature, and one altogether un
locked for some months ago, is the surprising ease with which the
crops have been moved this fall. Attention has already been called
to this. The bulk of the movement is over, and hardly a ripple has j
been observed on the surface of the financial pool. In previous I
years, even the best, the moving of the crops was a disturbing ele
ment for several months. The Western cities were obliged to draw
upon New York heavily for funds, the money market consequently j
became strained, and often the Government had to go to the assist
ance of the New York banks by anticipating the January bond in- 1
terest and in other ways, but this year the crops have been moved
with practically little outside aid, not enough really to attract at
tention.
This brilliant condition is wholly due to the enormous amounts
of money held by the Eastern and Western banks, which rendered '
extraneous assistance unnecessary. True, Secretary Shaw has just j
called upon the national banks for 25 per cent of the Government de- j
posits held by them, which will call about $25,000,000 into the j
Treasury, but it is not known whether this draft was rendered i
necessary for account of crop moving. However, the call was
not a surprise and created no comment, as it had been anticipated
for some time. No stringency in the money market is now expected, |
as the return flow of money from the West to New York has al- j
ready commenced.
The railroads, too, are making a fine exhibit, the gross earn- j
ings continually gaining, and running ahead of 1903. Net earnings
may prove less than last year, but if they do the decrease will be j
small. The earnings thus far in November are 8.6 per cent larger Â¦
than la^ year. The distribution of produce and merchandise is ex- 1
cellent all over the country and many sections are complaining of j
the tardiness with which the railroads are moving their goods. Col
lections are easy, and the weeks failures were only 217, against 249
last year. The staples are not behind in their exhibit, the iron, steel
and textile industries all reporting an expansion, while the majority ,
of farm products are still in brisk demand at prices which are keep- j
ing the farmers well up in the front of the procession. i
Commercially, this is a great fall. Nobody expected such a re- .
vival in business a few months ago. As a Presidential year 1904 has
been a surprise to the whole country. It may not be duplicated in
this generation and will probably hcrtafter be known as a banner ;
election year. The usual early winter lull is now due, but it has not j
yet appeared, and may not. as this is a year 0/ surprises.
LAST week was a noteworthy one and in some respects the best
week since the current recovery in business commenced, sev
eral weeks ago. From all quarters came reports of expanding
trade, wholesale, retail and jobbing, though the great storm in the
East interfered with the movement of goods and otherwise impeded
trade by prostrating the telegraph wires in all directions. Had it
not been for this storm the week would have been a record breaker
in manv lines.
A REMARKABLE TRADE FALL.
J^ ISS WAINWRIGHT, with a
ffl troubled look In her wide
111 gray eyes, came slowly down
I * 1 the lawn and stepping- into
/ I the rowboat, pushed off. She
wanted to be aloneâ to think.
This afternoon, as she had swung
lazily in her hammock, across the
water had come a bark from some dog
âa bark strangely resembling that of
the lost Teddyboy and Miss Wain
wrlght had been conscious of a vague
disquietude.
It was two months now since the
sad day when Teddyboy had disap
pearedâTeddyboy. with his silky coat,
tiny paws and adoring brown eyes.
The ehrlll little bark had evoked that
dear memory and mingled with the
thoughts of Teddyboy had stolen
in persistent thoughts of his
donor, Teddy Mathewson. She
had not seen him since their
quarrel, six months agoâ a quarrel or
iginating over the question as to
whether Teddyboy's blessed ears
should be droopy and soft or snappy
and short. But a very pretty differ
ence can arise from a very small cause.
It was fortunate that they had dis
covered their lack of congeniality in
time, mused the girl.
As Miss Wainwright neared the
yachts that rested in the harbor like
great white birds, again the bark rang
out and the girl started. Could it be
possible? Pulling in closer, she
glanced around, while the bark
changed to a crescendo of Joy. There
at the head of the companionway on
the first yacht etood Teddyboy him
self, his ?maU body alive with wrig
gles of excitement, afraid to descend,
beseeching that she come to him. Her
own Teddyboy! Without stopping to
think. Miss Wainwright hastily flung
the painter around a stanchion, then
sped up the steps. In a second the
little dog: was upon her and the girl,
between laughter and . tears, had
caught him close.
With Teddyboy in her arms, Mis3
Wainwright hesitated. Should she
simply take the dog and go? To be
sure, it was her dog, but still that
hardly, seemed a square thing to do.
And then suddenly she turned white.
Down the deck' toward her walked
Teddy Mathewson. The man was the
first to speak.
"May I ask to what I am indebted
for the honor of this visit?-" he asked
conventionally.
Miss Wainwright, all confusion,
clutched Teddyboy closer.
"I â I did not know that you were
here; I thought you still in Europe,"
she stammered. "I â I came for Ted
dyboy." gathering courage as she pro
ceeded. "I saw him on the deck. He
was stolen from me some weeks ago."
The man's face cjleared a trifle. She
had not sold the dog then; he had
been imagining that any reminder of
the giver had become distasteful to
her.
"I bought him back from a man in
the street," he said. "Of course, I
recognized Teddyboy. But I fancied
that you had disposed of him. I have
grown fond of the little fellow."
Teddyboy, in Miss Wainwright's
arms, was making frantic efforts to
reach his master. "And you see he
cares for me. too." he added, with a
smile. Miss Wainwright turned away.
"Give me my dog and let me go!"
she cried sharply.
"Pardon me, my dog." declared
Mathewson. calmly. "Shall he
choose?" But the girl, reaching the
companionway, uttered a little cry.
No boat was to be seen. Mathewson
stepped to the rail.
"The current there is very strong,"
he commented. "Probably the knot
that you tied was insufficient."
Miss Wainwright's eyes biased.
"Kindly have me s^nt ashore at
once." she cried.
Tlie man shook his head.
"I am very sorry," he remarked,
cheerfully, "but the boat is already
ashore. It went in some time ago to
bring out people for tea. Mrs. Mar
shall wished to see the yacht. There
they come now."
Â¦ Miss Wainwright's annoyance deep
ened.
"Mrs. Marshall?" she exclaimed.
"For ten?"
Was there ever such a hateful pre
dicament. The worst gossip in Easter
ly on her way to the yacht and she,
Sybil Wainwright, unchaperoned and
helpless, en board. Mathewson sup
pressed a smile.
"Would you care to hide?" he sug
gested civilly.
"Hide!" repeated Miss Wainwright,
with contemptuous scorn. It was quite
In her conception of him that he should
make such a proposition. Mathewson
intently studying the bit of ear vouch
safed him, and noting the dejected
poise of the slender figure, felt his
mouth tighten. A curious light leaped
to his eyes.
"I'll do it," he murmured. "It is a
"I ' wajit you to meet Miss Waln
wrigbt," he eaid distinctly. "In fact,
the little tea to-day is given for her.
Our engagement fs not yet announced,
but I wished you to be among the first
to learn of It."
Miss Wain wright. the color flooding
to her temples, bent to put Teddyboy
on the deck. When ah* lifted her
head to receive Mrs. Marshall's felicl-
big chance, butâ'* The next moment
he was welcoming his guests. AÂ» Mrs.
Marshall extended a plump hand he
bowed low.
Let him predict a pleasant day â the
farmers all complain
Because their crops are drying up, and
they have prayed for rain.
Then when he sees them looking sad be
cause their crops are sere,
He cheers them up with: "Frequent
showers, and thousands say, "O,
dear!"
Of course, you do not need to have me
tell you here in rhyme
That all the world would starve with
pleasant weather all the time.
"We can't have rain ai?d sunshine both to
order every day.
And different folks want different things,
and some qnemust give way.
The moral Is, of course: "Don't kick! It
won't do any good.
For everything will have to go as nature
thinks it should.
And when the prophecies don't please,
don't blame the weather man.
He can't please everybody, and he does
the best he can.

In the party besides Schiff are Sir
Ernest Cassell. member of the Privy
Council of King Edward VII, Robert
Fleming, Max B. Bonn of Stern Bro.?.
& Co. and Valentine Fleming, all of
London, and General James H. Wilson
of New York City.
Robert Fleming is the most influen
tial personage in American railway
properties in London. Bonn was for
a time a partner of Speyer & Co.
Word has been received here that Ja- J
cob H. Schiff and a party of distin- '
gulshed London financiers left New ,
York on Wednesday for a tour of the j
Far West. It is stated that the trip i*Â»
solely for pleasure and is not associat- ;
ed with any contemplated financial en- 1
terprise. The party is in special cars, !
but these cars will most of the time be
coupled up into 1 a special train. The j
party left over the Pennsylvania road j
for St. Louis, and after viewine the ,
World's Fair the party will go to Chi- j
cago and thence come to the Pacific
Coast.
It is not known just \\ihen the party
will reach San Francisco, for when
Schiff left Xew York he had not decid
ed how long they would remain in St. (
Louis and Chicago, or whether he j
would stop off at intermediate points |
on the way to San Francisco. It is j
probable, however, that stops will be \
made at Denver and Salt Lake City.

W. Longfellow, whom he proclaimed
the "pere of sonnet writers"â from
Wordsworth. Keats. Browning and our

Flers are guilty. Congratulations, Dr.
Taylor â nut so much upon the apparent

"8AMPLES ONLY"â The following are but
a few sample cases out of the MULTITUDE
successfully treated last week:
"CRIPPLE LEAPS" â Inflammatory rheuma-
tism stiffened my spine and limbs, could
barely CREEP along; last Tuesday Rexradlo
straightened me out and limbered me up;
raised limbs naturally, RAN and LEAPED.
Many similar cases. - .
"LIFE SAVED" â "At the â¢crisis' ot &*ngf
__ous disease he saved my life."
"DEATH "AVERTED"â â¢'Rexradio speedily.
thoroughly cured me of dreadful malady,
which slowly but surely leads to certain
death."
"SCIATICA'S DEMON FANG3 exquisitely
tortured me; Rexradio's power speedily slew
this GILA MONSTER and I entered -a
PAINLESS PARADISE."
"IT STAYS" â "Rexradio cured my GASTRI-
TIS In July; I stay cured."
"THE FIFB.Y FURNACE of Typhoid Fever
was consuming rhe; Rexradlo quickly quench-
ed It and delivered me."
"COULDN'T STOOP through Lumbago; quick-
ly, painlessly stooped and touched floor with
hands last week." (Numerous others.)
"NO RETURN TICKET" â "My cancer left
many weeks ago and having no return ticket
| It remains away."
"PILLORIED" FOR YEARS" by deforming
"articular" rheumatism, Jolnt3 SoliJ and
"Immovable." helpless, entirely waited on
by others, lifted from and Into bed. racked
with severest pains all over, groaning with
agony if even lightly touched, lying in bed
like a statue of marble, Mrs. Knowles, 379
Bartlett, by Rexradio's ONE treatment was
instantly able to freely, naturally, move
each loosened Joint, ro6e from bed,
and seated herself in a chair; first time in
years; her excruciating pains ceaaed and be-
ing at her request vigorously slapped she
declared the blows produced no pain; her
cheery welcome awaits "visitors"; she will
grasp and shake your hand with the hands
so long solid and unable to cloee. SEE
HER. j
"FIRMLY LOCKED JOINTS." due to AN-
CHYLOSIS in several cases recently, have
been UNLOCKED and set at liberty by the
MASTER KEY of Rexradio's "humanized
Radium." (Proofs.)
DISLOCATED VERTEBRA." â One of the
spine bones thrown out of place, protruded
outwardiy. producing PARALYSIS: Rex-
mdio's wonderful piwer replaced it, also re-
moved the paralysis so I could run ana
LEAP; see me." A precisely similar case
had a like benefit a week since.
â¢IS ITS TOILS" â Acutely painful RHEUM-
\TISM had m-e In its tolls; couldn't stoop,
raise feet, scarcely walk: Rexradto touched
me twico and. stooping. I touched the floor
with my hands, raised feet hteh, RAN and
LEAPED freÂ«"Iv. painlessly; pains all gone
and smart slapping d!d not hurt, wherethe
least touch had produced agony before.
"MUSIC IN HIS HEAD"â Totally deaf pa-
tient complained of hi?slns, crackling, roar-
ing and MUSICAL sounds in his head: after
(one) treatment he hÂ»arJ a WHISPER and
said "All those noises have c?aÂ«e<l and even
my MUSICAL BOX haa RUN DOWN."
"FAR REACHING" treatmentâ Numerous pa-
tients have been successfully treated for
various diseases, hundreds of miles away
without seeing Rexradio.
"SEVERAL PHYSICIANS" testify they PAW
Rexradio treat alleged "Incurable" diseases
with amazing success. (Names at offices.)
"LIKE MAGIC"â I saw the large CANCER
before R's (single) treatment; after, it wa3
lost to sight and touch. It was like magic.
"DANGER POINT" â Rexradto's (one) treat-
ment at once removed my bedridden friend's
agonies -when her acute disease had reached
the "alarming" danger point; next day she
rose WELL.
"PERMANENT RESULTS" â One treatment
may and often does secure surorisln* re-
sults, the possible permanence of which de-
pends on a limited number of further daily
treatments.
"PUBLICITY" is objected to by the above pa-*
tlents. hence their "names" are not here
published, but persons similarly afflicted will
find them at the offices.

Mexican People in Las Vejras Place
Their Grievance Before
tlic Court.
"WASHINGTON, Nov. 20. â Justice
Barnard of the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia yesterday heard
arguments in the case of the people of
the- town of Las Vegas, the county seat
of San Miguel County, New Mexico,
against the Postmaster General, In
which the former seeks to compel the
re-establishment of a postofflce there.
The action, which was recently fought
out in the Postoffice Department, grew
out of the discontinuance of the post
office, its consolidation with the "city"
of Las Vegas and the establishment of
a free delivery system in both places.
It was claimed yesterday that what
is known as the town is the older part
of the community and is Inhabited
largely by Mexicans, who are not satis
fied with the change, even though un
der the new system their mails are
delivered at their doors. The court
reserved decision.
OBJECT WHEN THE MAHj ' * . '

SANTA ROSA, Nov. 20.â The Petalu
ma and Santa Rosa Electric Railway is
the cause of the opening up of new ter
ritory In Sonoma County to settlement.
The road does not start into regular
operation until next Saturday, but al
ready a new town has sprung up, and
several large ranches have been cut up
and placed on the market. The Hill
tract, on the line of the new road near
Stony Point, haâ¬ been subdivided and
offered to settlers. More than forty
families have purchased homes there.
Harrison Mecham is engaged in sub
dividing a tract of more than four
thousand acres at the present time, and
this will also be sold to settlers.
The town of Green Valley has sprung
into existence. It is at the terminus
of the electric road north of Sebasto
pol, and comprises four large ranches,
which have been surveyed and laid out
In streets and town blocks. A town
hall has been built, and the new city
is growing rapidly. The large Wetmore
drier which formerly was in use o^ the
Sonoma, road has been moved to
Green Valley to accommodate the fruit
Industry of that section. It is In the
midst of one of the richest fruit grow
ing sections of Sonoma County, and
adjoins the largest berry farms in the
entire State.
Beginning with Saturday next the
electric railroad will put on a regular
schedule of freight and passenger cars,
and connect this city with Sebastopol,
Petaluma and other places. A celebra
tion is being planned for the time when
the first car over the new road reaches
the county seat.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 20.â The PrincÂ©
line steamship Sicilian Prince, from
Genoa and Naples, lies aground to
night on the Long Island shore, one
mile west o* the Long Beach lifesav
ing station. The steamship stranded
just before daylight this morning and
all efforts throughout the day to get
the vessel into deeper water proved
futile.
Four tugs are standing by the vessel,
and, with hawsers made fast to bow
and stern, their united efforts are
keeping her from being floated farther
on the beach.
An attempt was made to^> float the
Sicilian Prince at flood tide, at 5 o'clock
this evening, and with the assistance
of her own engines, she moved about
1000 feet, but still held fast to the sandy
bottom.
The vessel lies easily on the beach-
There Is little surf and hardly any
wind, and unless a storm breaks, it Is
expected the ship will be pulled off
the bar at flood tide In the morning.
Should this attempt fall, the 600 steerr
age and twelve cabin passengers will
be taken off on steamboats or tugs
and brought to this city and the cargo
will be lightered. The vessel lies 300
yards off shore, in about eighteen feet
of water.
The Sicilian Prince Is fourteen days
from Italian ports and has about 600
Italian emigrants in the steerage. An
unusually fasftrip had been made, and
when she struck this morning she was
making about twelve knots. .Captain
Richard Van Wycklen, In change of the
Long Island saving station, says:
"It was hazy at the time and the
captain of the Sicilian Prince was
steering in a northeasterly course.
His only explanation of the vessel
being so close in shore is what he
learned from some of-the crew of the
ship who say that Captain William
Hank of the Prince liner saw the Sandy
Hook light and mistook it for the
Barneygate light on the Jersey coast.
The steamship grounded so easily that
few of the passengers; Knew of her pre
dicament until daylight.
Late to-night it was reported the
Sicilian Prince vas still resting easily.
There was more surf than during the
day and the vessel was rolling some,
but there was every assurance that she
would be floated In the morning.
The Sicilian Prince is a steel vessel
of 1705 tons net. She was built In
Greenock in 1889 and has seven water
tight compartments. Her length is 363
feet. . -

MARKSMEN THRONG THE RANGE
AT MARIN COUNTY PARK
Nelson Journeyed to Mill Valley on
Saturday night to referee a bout given
for the benefit of an athletic club. Not
withstanding the fact that he retired
after midnight he arose at daylight
and went afield after quail.
A twelve-mile run and an hour's hard
work in thÂ» gymnasium constituted his
day's work. Nelson weighs about 132
pounds, but could reach the required
weight at a day's notice.
A largo delegation of sporting men
and many Chicago friends of Battling
Nelson visited Smiling Metzner's tav
ern yesterday to watch the Dane work
for his coming battle with Young Cor
bett. The visitors were given a rare
treat, as Battling fought two slugging
matches with Frank Rafael and Eddie
San try-
Manager Murphy had to interfere
many times to save Rafael and Santry
from being knocked out. Both fight
ers showed the effects of the milling
when finished.
He is the chief sufferer c-n these oc
casions, as the scales have always
showed him at weight when the proper
time arrived. .Corbett claims he would
be below the 130 pound notch now if
he had pitched his camp tn some warm
locality. He does not think it would
be advisable to be so low in weight,
as it would take from his strength.
He put in five days of hard gymna
sium work last week. As a change
from this he went on the road twice
on Saturday. He was on the road again
yesterday, as the crowd of spectators
at his quarters interfered with his in
door work.
Corbeit does not underestimate Nel
son's ability; He knows that a man
who can defeat such clever boxers as
Art Simms and Martin Canole, such a
game boy as Eddie Hanlc-n and such
a hard hitter as Herrera, is not to be
held lightly. Defeat for Corbett means
practically the end of his Ting career,
so that he is staking his all on this
battle.
Young CVrbett is assuring his friends
that he will be at weight next Sun
day for his fight with Battling Nelson,
which will take place in Woodward's
Pavilion c-ne week from to-morrow
nicht. During Corbett's kmt; spell of
leisure the weight accumulated on his
frame and he has found considerable
difficulty in dislodging it. The surplus
weight is about his body, his arms and
leps responding quickly to the exercise
he save them.
Tho LVnver boxer shows tremendous
hitting power. One if his first acts
was Xo break the nose of his sparring
partner. Billy utts. . He then hooked
up with Jack Johnson, the colored
heavyweight champion, and cut his lip
severely. The question of weight has
always been a troublesnme one at Cw
bett's camp. He invariably indulges
his appetite for both food and drink
and then finds himself at the eleventh
hour confronted with the problem of
fairly ripping off the excess weight.
Oniy one tournament match was
played on the tennis courts yesterday,
but the fin" weather brought out an
usually large crowd for practice. Oi.
the park courts the finals of the handi
cap doubles tournament camp up for
decision. A? was oxported. the Baker
brothers â George and Neil â carried off
the honor*. Thev were opposed to
Horace Mann ar>d Robert Drolla. The
latter received odds of "3-6" while the
Baker brothers wore "15" behind
scratch.
The odds wVre about ritht. as the
scorrs show. Thf handicap men put
up a good flcht and made an exc?ll*Â»nt
ehowing against their steadier oppo
nents. The first set was close, going to
the Bakers by a score of 7 â 5. The next
pet they won easily. The third set went
to Mann and Drolla. They looked to
have a good chance to make it sets
all in the fourth set. This was the
closest set of the four and ;vas won by
the Baker brothers after fourteen
trames had been played. The complete
prorc was 7-5, 6-3, 4-5, 8-6. This makes
the winners' second victory and th^y
are now in the lead in the race for the
cupe.
A round robin match has been ar
ranged by six of the most prominent
young players of the Golden Gate and
California clubs. It is not an inter
club-affair, but it happens that the
players are from each club. They are
Carl Gardner, George Janes and Her
bert Long of the- California Club and
Clarence Griffin. Charles Foley and
Neil Baker of the Golden Gate Club.
Two matches were played yesterday
and vk-ne won by Long and Jane^
Long beat Griffin and Janes beat Fo-

There was no tournament at the Cal
ifornia Club, but all of the active play
ers were out practicing for Thursday's
tournament. Champion MacGavin was
at his best yesterday. He played Har
ry Rolfe three sets. The best the lat
teT could do was to win two games in
the first set. In the last two sets he.
failed to get a came.

VICTORY' FOR SOLDIERS.
The scheduled mat'cTi between the
Oakland Hornets and Occidentals >as
not played yesterday, the ground -at
Ninth and Bryant streets being en
gaged for the afternoon.
W. Mechels, who was captain of the
Independents' team last season, played
a strong game at back, though it was
the first time that he has appeared on
the field since March of this year.
On the cricket ground at Alameda the
Albion Rovers defeated the Eagles S
goals to 1 itj a match played yesterday
afternoon. In the morning the second
eleven of the Vampires beat the second
team of the Occidentals, 3 goals to 2,
on the Alameda ground.
Two matches for the 1304-1905 cham
pionship of the California Association
Football League and one practice
game were played yesterday. At Free
mans Park, Golden Gate, the In
dependent team played all around
the Vampires, scoring 6 goals to the
latter's 1. The baP. was kicked off at
2:43 p. m.. C. W. Irish being the referee.
The Independents assumed the ag
gressive at once, scoring two goals in
the first ten minutes. During the llrst
period the Independents put the ball
into tho net three times, E. Fay scoring
one of the goal? and J. Jones the other
two. Early in the second half T. Fay
scored a fourth goal for the Indepen
dents. The only point made by the
Vampires was scored by Lees, who car
lied the ball down the field and put it
into the net. Before the call of time
Jones and P. Fay scored one goal
apiece, making the score read: Inde
pendents, 6; Vampires, 1.
For the winners the Fay brothers and
Jones played a fine game in the for
ward line, passing cleverly and repeat
edly beating the Vampire halfbacks
and backs. For the losers Glarner and
Petersen rendered good service, though
the latter seemed hardly up to his best
form. The teams lined up as follows:

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 20. â Oakland
took toyday's game, the final of the
s< ries, and thus split even on the
week's play. The score to-day was 4
to 1. It was one of th-? hardest strug
gles of the series, both teams playing
their best. Buchanan proved a
stumbling block in the way' of the
Angels. Newton, who opposed him,
had one bad inning, but that was
enough to give the game to Oakland.
The crowd In attendance was about
10,000, the largest in Los Angeles

FRESNO, Nov. 20.â Keefe out
pitched Hogg to-day and the final
game of the Tacoma-Seattle series
went to the Tigers. The game was an
exciting one throughout, both teams
playing in splendid form. An error by
Van Haltren In the second in failing
to hold Graham's long drive let in
Raymer from third. The support of
the Tacoma club to Keefe was error
less. Raymer being the star, accepting
eight chances, several of the difficult
type. An altercation took place dur
ing the game between C. Hall and
Nordyke. The latter took offense at
a remark by Hall made from the
coaching line. Xordkye slapped Hall's
fÂ«ee. Other members of the team in
terfered before further trouble could
ensue. The score:

Stolen base*â Illldcbrand (2), Van Duren,
Whalen Blanks die Brownies.
The Portland Brownies gamboled on
the green at "the Eighth street base
ball lot yesterday afternoon for the
last time this year. They were beaten
of course, but that is nothing extraor
dinary, tor the lirownies 'are beaten
nearly every time they appear. At
Oakland in the morning fate and bad
baseball combined to overthrow their
calculations again. Sec-resâ Morning
game, San Francisco 6, Portland 0; aft
ernoon game, San Francisco 5, Port
land 2.
Mr. Jake Thielman possibly figured
on another forfeited_ game when he
consented to hurl his offerings against
the- Seals for the second time running.
But all the members c-f the home team
were the meek kids and they won the
game easily at that, though it looked
bad ir. the second round.
Beck swung through for a double,
Spencer, Nadeau and Thielman singled.
Spencer and Nadeau then pulled off a
double steal while the rally was on.
This counted, for the Brownies emerged
with three earned runs. The Seals
were right there with a comeback in
their half c-f the same period. Old
Wooden Shoes bit off a good one, Goeh
nauer and Wilson followed with others
and Wheeler ilew to right field. While
Murdock hurried the ball to- first to
double Wilson up, Gochnauer sneaked
in. making it a pair for the Seals. â¢
The aspect did not change till the
sixth, when Thielman walked Ander
son and Gochnauer and hit Wilson in
the slats, making a full house. Wheel
er soused one to Frary and while he
was being retired Andy tore through.
Then Runklo erred on Hilde's shot and
Gochnauer arrived. Waldron scored the
last one for Uncle on two errors by
Runkle and a clever steal in the eighth.
The score:

A new remedy for carbon-monoxide
poisoning was given a test at the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital yesterday
and proved a success. The new treat
ment is the discovery of a French phy
sician and was used by Dr. R. C. Hill
in the case of Edward Tracy.
Tracy, who is a bartender by occu
pation, after locking himself in his
room at 132 Sixth street turned on
the gas and lay down to die. The
odor of escaping gas was detected by
the owner of the roominsr-house and
he opened the door and found Tracy
unconscious. The would-be suicide
was hurried to the Emergency Hospi
tal, where the new treatment was ad
ministered. It consists simply of In
troducing peroxide of hydrogen Into
the stomach. This counteracts the ef
fects of the gas poisoning by its ab
sorption into the blood. It worked
splendidly and Tracy will recover, al
though he was almost dead when
taken to the hospital.

sharpened their appetites.
After viewing the surrounding
country the party sought a comfort

As the two cars were passing Cas
tellero was seen to fall. Whether his
grip was loosened by brushing against
passengers hanging to the stanchions
bf the outbound car or whether the fall
Avas caused in some other way will
probably never be known.
The unfortunate nian was picked up
by an Inspector of the United Railroads
and taken to St. Luke's hospital, where
he was found to be suffering from a
fracture of the skull. Little hope was
entertained for his recovery from tho
start, and at 8:30 .ast night he died.
â¢ Policeman Mahoney arrested Samuel
Pinkerton, the motorman of car 1242,
and charged him with battery. Later
when It was learned that Castellero
was dead the charge was changed to
manslaughter.
The accident occurred near the
United Railroad's power house, shortly
after 1 o'clock. The cars, both in
bound and outbound, were crowded and
many were hanging to the stanchions
with but a precarious foothold on the
steps.
Louis Castellero, a gardener living at
Silver and Cambridge streets, fell or
was knocked from an Inbound San
Mateo car yesterday afternoon and
sustained injuries from which he died
a few. hours later.
When the Mexico was dredging out
Vera Cruz harbor on the Atlantic coast
she anchored over the spot where a
pirate ship had foundered and gone
down long before. Among the swords,
spear-heads and remains of muskets
w.ere seen dropping into the tank many
coins. The pumps were stopped until
arrangements could be made to secure
this fortune that was flowing up to
them from the long lost and forgot
ten treasures in the deep. The crew
hung over the end of the pipe im
provised sieves and gathered in several
thousand dollars of gold and silver
coins before the lost store of some free
booter of the Spanish Main was ex
hausted. One of the prizes of the
dredger was a small Iron casket which
when broken open was found to con
tain several jewels, and letters, which,
however, had become so stained with
age in their airtight case, were not
legible. In Vera Cruz harbor a large
number of cannon balls, which had
been shot at the American fleet by the
Mexican shore batteries, were pumped
up and presented to the historical mu
seum.
The dredger Is under contract to the
Mexican Government to deepen certain
harbors of that country and after fin
ishing the work on the Pacific will re
turn to the Atlantic side of the re
public. The magnitude of the work
can be estimated by he fact that the
vessel dredged in Vera Cruz harbor
continuously for seven years.
Many strange things are brought up
from the deep by the irresistible force
of those great centrifugal pumps.
Shells, such as never come to the sur
face, are driven up v by the current, as8
is the metal dropped overboard from
the ships of long ago. Often medals
and coins come up through the pipes
and the men on watch around the edge
of the tank have found on the sand
pieces-of-eight and other specimens of
the coinage when Spain was the treas
ure house and the mint of the world.
PUMPIXG A PIRATE'S TREASURE.
The British dredger Mexico, Captain
Ross Kennedy, is moored at Mission
street wharf, where the machinists of
the Risdon Iron Works are busy mak
ing extensive repairs prior to her re
turn to Salina Cruz. Mexico. She re
cently came here after eighteen
months' constant labor, dredging In the
harbor bottom of that port, and will go
back to her work when the final bolt
of her massive and complicated ma
chinery is tightened up.
This blf floating; machine was con
structed on the Clyde eighteen years
ago from special plans, and was an
experiment in the way of submarine
dredging. The experiment was a per
fect success, tor ever since the day she
slid into the water she has been busy
pumping: up the bed Â¦ of the ocean.
With her huge twenty-inch suction
pipes, one on either side of the hull,
about 2500 tons of sand are drawn up
every hour. This is deposited In the
great tank-like hold of the vessel. Then
the two pumping engines are stopped,
the pipes and anchors are hoisted and
the two propelling engines drive the
dredger out to sea. There the tank is
opened, or to plainly describe the ope
ration, the vessel's bottom literally
drops out, and the tons of sand in
stantly slide down In the deep waters
of the ocean.
MACHINERY'S PERFECT WORK.
The falling doors of the tank close so
quickly that very little water gets in
and the dredger returns to her work in
the harbor. Of course much water Is
pumped In, but as the sand and mud,
by reason of their greater weight, sink
to the bottom of the tank, the water is
easily drawn back into the sea. If nec
essary, the matter taken from the sea
bottom can be pumped ashore simply
by lengthening out the great suction
pipes and landing the ends on the
beach.
This is all so easy. Just the turn of
a little wheel and the work Is done.
At the spot where the dredging is to
take place, the vessel is anchored head
and etern, pipes are lowered In the
water, pumping engines are started and
the great fans that create the vacuum
which draws the ocean's bottoms into
the Mexico's tank, begin to revolve.
Not an ounce of human muscle is ex
erted in this stupendous labor of lifting
the sea-bed to the surrace. The pon
derous machinery true to its design
moves unerringly in Its grooves and the
work is performed. â¢
The officers came to the conclusion
that Mrs. Stanley's death was caused
by drinking diluted alcohol.
The woman was utterly destitute. On
a table in the room lay a copy of
Moore's poems opened at one of the
saddest passages of "The Fire Worship
ers." The woman babbled bits of this
poem in her ravings.
Mrs. Stanley was the wife of Joseph
Stanley, a racetrack man, but had not
been living with him for some time.
Mrs. Robertson said the woman was an
intimate friend of Septimus Green, an
employe of the St. Francis Hotel. The
two quarreled about two weeks ago and
after that Mrs. Stanley began to drink
heavily until she was smitten by the
illness that proved fatal.
Mrs. Stanley was about SO years old
and a rather pretty type of brunette.
She was a native of Texas. The body
was taken to tnfe Morgue.
Policeman Maloney immediately no
tified the central office and and Detec
tive Silvey was detailed on the case.
With Coroners Deputies Brown and
Murphy he made a search of the prem
ises.
Just as death closed the eyes of Mrs.
Nina Stanley yesterday a policeman
hurried into her room with a warrant
for her arrest. The woman had been
lying ill at 622 Post street for four days.
She had sought to drown her troubles
in dissipation and, not being over ro
bust, succumbed.
Her cries disturbed the other lodgers
In the house and they complained . to
the landlord, D. B. Francis. He de
cided that the best way to have 'her
removed was to swear out a warrant
for disturbing the peace.
Mrs. A. H. Robertson, who lived in
the house, took pity on the unfortunate
woman and watched by her bedside for
three nights. To her Mrs. Stanley, con
fided that she had no relatives, Â¦ and
that her friends of better davs had
turned her aside. Shortly after noon
yesterday the dying woman's ravings
ceased. As Mrs. Robertson bent over
the sufferer a double knock sounded at
the door. Mrs. Robertson opened it and
was confronted by Policeman J. E. Ma
loney.
"I have a warrant for the arrest of a
woman here," said the policeman.
Mrs. Robertson took him into the
room and pointed to the bed where Mrs.
Stanley lay.
"I can't arrest that woman," said
Maloney quickly, "why, she ought to be
in a hospital." - .'â¢
Mrs. Robertson bent over the silent
figure and started back. The police
man felt for a pulse, but Mrs. Stanley
was dead. She died while the warrant
was on the/ way.
Harry J. Squire, bartender In Daniel
M. Hinman's saloon, 116 Eddy street.
was arrested yesterday morning by De
. tectives Braig and Silvey on suspicion
of having set fire to the saloon at an
early hour yesterday morning. TherÂ«
was ample" evidence that a pre
j meditated attempt had been . mado.
; to burn down the building. The upper
! stories are occupied as a lodging house
by Frank Batchelder.
Policeman Cullinane was notified
shortly before 3 o'clock that there was
Â¦ a fire in the saloon. He hurried there
and was joined by Policeman Fennell,
Charles Kennedy of 1254 Eddy street.
i and Batchelder. Smoke was seen Issu
; Ing from the transom. Kennedy ob
' talnefl.an entrance through a window
i in the rear which had been left open,
i and found the place full of smoke.
When the men reached the seat of the
fire in a closet behind the bar they
found that pieces of paper saturated
with coal oil had been set on fire. A
portion of the partition dividing the
saloon from a barber shop occupied
by J. A. Wetzel had been burned. A
portiere had also taken fire and it was
j supposed that it had prevented, the
I flames from spreading.
i UTILIZES OIL AND GAS.
The floor was saturated with coal oil
which had come out of a quart bottle
that was lying horizontally on the
I floor. A half gallon siphon bottle of
1 gasoline was within a foot of the fire.
i Near the closet was a gas heater used
| by the barber for keeping water hot.
' The gas was escaping from this heater
; in full force, which would also have
helped In causing an explosion.
Cullinane sent in a still alarm to En
gine 17 and also notified Detectives
i Braig and Silvey at police headquar
i ters and Fire Marshal Towe. The of
! ficers at once started an Investigation.
AVetzel, ,the barber, was seen and he
said that he closed up his shop at a
few minutes after ten o'clock Saturday
night and at that time no gas was es
capfng from the heater. He locks his
door from the Inside and leaves by way
of the saloon.
iiixmax not ix crrr.
Hinman lives at 708 Haight street
and Squire lived with him. They
learned from Mrs. Hinman that her
husband had gone to Petaluma on
Thursday. Suspicion fell upon Squire
and he was placed under arrest. He
said he left the saloon about 1:30
o'clock and went to a ball at the Me
chanics' Pavilion. He denied knowing
anything about the fire. He admitted
that the stock and fixtures were In
sured, but he did not know in what
company or to what amount. He had
not received any salary from Hinman
for six months. . ___ .'"-...
About two months ago there was a.
fire in 'the same saloon and Hinman
was allowed $200 for the loss sustained.
The detectives and Fire Marshal are
satisfied that the place was set on fire
with the object of obtaining the Insur
ance^ money. Their theory is that
whoever was the incendiary .had util
ized the portiere to prevent the flames
from spreading too quickly so that he
could be in a position to set up an alibi,
but it had the effect of smothering the
fire. Hinman will be questioned when
he returns to the city. It Is alleged
that the saloon had been doing a poor,
business and that the stock was not !
of much value. The saloon used to be
occupied by J. M. Evans.

sermon.
The regrular hour for tho first mis

The second service will take place
at 9 o'clock each morning for the two
weeks, and the evening mission ser
